To very many relief comes in splendid\r\nself-sacrificing action, in the joyful exercise of youthful strength\r\nand vigour for a noble cause. But even these, as well as those who are\r\nless fortunate, need intervals of diversion--brief change of thought\r\nand mental occupation--after which they may return to their great\r\nduties rested and refreshed.\r\n\r\nI know that there are many who find a never-failing source of happiness\r\nin acquaintance with things belonging to that vast area of Nature which\r\nis beyond and apart from human misery, an area unseen and unsuspected\r\nby most of us and yet teeming with things of exquisite beauty; an area\r\ncapable of yielding to man knowledge of inestimable value. Many are\r\napt to think that the value of \"Science\" is to be measured mainly,\r\nif not exclusively, by the actual power which it has conferred on\r\nman--mechanical and electrical devices, explosives, life-saving control\r\nover disease. They would say of Science, as the ignoble proverb tells\r\nus of Honesty, that it is \"the best policy.\" But Honesty is far more\r\nthan that, and so is Science. Science has revealed to man his own\r\norigin and history, and his place in this world of un-ending marvels\r\nand beauty. It has given him a new and unassailable outlook on all\r\nthings both great and small. Science commends itself to us as does\r\nHonesty and as does great Art and all fine thought and deed--not as a\r\npolicy yielding material profits, but because it satisfies man's soul.\r\n\r\nI offer these chapters to the reader as possibly affording to him,\r\nas their revision has to me, a welcome escape, when health demands\r\nit, from the immense and inexorable obsession of warfare. The several\r\nchapters have been selected from articles entitled \"Science from an\r\nEasy Chair\" written in recent years by me for the \"Daily Telegraph.\"\r\nUnder that title I have already published two volumes of similar\r\nselections. I have chosen a new title, \"Diversions of a Naturalist,\"\r\nfor this third volume in order to avoid confusion with the earlier\r\nones. Illustrative drawings have been introduced into several of the\r\narticles and a few alterations made in the text. But they remain\r\nessentially what their origin implies--namely, detached essays\r\naddressed to a wide public.\r\n\r\nI wish to thank my friend Dr. Smith Woodward of the Natural History\r\nMuseum for the figures 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30, illustrating\r\nChapter X, and also to thank Messrs. Veitch for the use of figures 33,\r\n34, 35, 40, and 42. I have copied figures 4 to 8, 11, 19, and 20 from\r\nthe drawings made by Philip Henry Gosse, F.R.S., and published by him\r\nin that wonderful little book \"Marine Zoology,\" now long out of print.\r\nI have also borrowed my frontispiece from the book on \"The Aquarium\"\r\nby that great naturalist and lover of the seashore. Many beautiful\r\ncoloured plates of marine animals executed by his skilful hand are to\r\nbe found in that and other works published by him.\r\n\r\n  E. R.

The orchids, the water-lilies, the engaging and\r\nquaintly named \"petty whin,\" and the pink rattle are joined with\r\nthe tall foxgloves and elder-blossoms in my memory. And for some\r\nreason--perhaps it is the heat--I am set thinking of very different\r\nscenes--the great, cool fiords of Norway, with their rocky islets and\r\nhuge, bare mountain-tops, where many years ago I had the \"time of\r\nmy life\" in exploring with the naturalist's dredge the coral-grown\r\nsea-bottom 1000 and even 2000 feet in a straight line below the little\r\nboat in which I and my companion and three Norwegian boatmen floated on\r\nthe dark purple waves.\r\n\r\nTo let a dredge--an oblong iron frame some three feet long, to the\r\nedges of which a bag of strong netting is laced, whilst the frame is\r\nhung to a rope by a mystical triangle--sink from the side of a boat and\r\nscrape the surface of the ocean-floor far below for some ten or twenty\r\nminutes, and then to haul it up again and see what living wonders\r\nthe unseen world has sent you, is, in my opinion, the most exciting\r\nand delightful sport in which a naturalist can indulge. There are\r\ndifficulties and drawbacks connected with it. You cannot, in a small\r\nboat and without expenditure of large sums on a steam yacht and crew,\r\nreach from our coast--with rare exceptions in the north-west--with\r\na fair prospect of returning in safety, those waters which are 100\r\nfathoms deep. And it is precisely in such depths that the most\r\ninteresting \"hauls\" are to be expected. I had had in former days to be\r\ncontent with 10 fathoms in the North Sea and 30 to 40 off the Channel\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nThen there is the question of sea-sickness. Nothing is so favourable\r\nto that diversion as slowly towing a dredge. I used to take the chance\r\nof being ill, and often suffered that for which no other joy than the\r\nhauling in of a rich dredgeful of rare sea creatures could possibly\r\ncompensate, or induce me to take the risk (as I did again and again).\r\nI remember lying very ill on the deck of a slowly lurching \"lugger\"\r\nin a heaving sea off Guernsey, when the dredge came up, and as its\r\ncontents were turned out near me, a semi-transparent, oblong, flattened\r\nthing like a small paper-knife began to hop about on the boards. It\r\nwas the first specimen I ever saw alive of the \"lancelet\" (Amphioxus),\r\nthat strange, fish-like little creature, the lowest of vertebrates.\r\nI recognized him and immediately felt restored to well-being, seized\r\nthe young stranger, and placed him in a special glass jar of clear\r\nsea-water. A few years later the fishermen at Naples would bring me,\r\nwithout any trouble to myself, twenty or more any day of the week\r\n(\"cimbarella\" they called them), and I not only have helped to make\r\nout the cimbarella's anatomy, but also to discover the history of\r\nthe extraordinary changes it undergoes as it grows from the egg. I\r\nsent my pupil Dr. Willey, now professor in Montreal, one summer to a\r\nnearly closed sea-lake, the \"pantano\" of Faro, near Messina, where the\r\nlancelet breeds. He brought home hundreds of minute young in various\r\nstages, and again later made a second visit to that remote sea-lake\r\nin order to complete our knowledge of their growth and structure by\r\nobservation on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the Norwegian fiords for a naturalist who loves to\r\n\"dredge\" is that at many parts of the coast you can sail into water\r\nof 200 fathoms depth and more, within three minutes from the rocky\r\nshore; and, secondly, that the great passage between the islands\r\nand the mainland is, to a very large extent, protected from those\r\nmovements of the surface which cause such torture to many innocent\r\npeople who venture on the sea in boats! Accordingly, in 1882, when I\r\nheard from the greatest naturalist-dredger of his day--the Rev. Canon\r\nNorman, of Durham--that he knew a farmhouse at Lervik, on the island\r\nof Stordö, near the mouth of the Hardanger Fiord, between Bergen and\r\nStavanger--where one could stay, and where a boat could be hired for\r\na couple of months--I determined to go there. I was confirmed in my\r\npurpose by the fact that Canon Norman had obtained in his dredge, at a\r\nspot near Lervik, which he marked for me on the large-scale official\r\nmap of the region, a very curious little polyp-like animal, attached\r\nto and branching on the stems of the white coral which one dredges\r\nthere at the depth of 150 fathoms. The little animal in quest of which\r\nI went, though other wonderful things were to be expected also, had\r\nbeen dredged originally by Dr. Norman off the Shetland Islands, and\r\ndescribed by Professor Allman, of Edinburgh. But they had not examined\r\nit in the living state with the microscope, and though they showed\r\nthat it was quite unlike other polyps, yet there was obvious need for\r\nfurther examination of it. I hoped to obtain its eggs and to watch\r\nits early growth. The name given to it by Allman was \"Rhabdopleura,\"\r\nmeaning \"rod-walled,\" alluding to a rod-like cord which runs along the\r\ninside of the delicate branching tube (only the one-twentieth of an\r\ninch wide), which the little animal constructs and inhabits.\r\n\r\nI sent a chest containing glass jars, microscopes, books, chemicals,\r\netc., and my dredge, as well as a large windlass, on which was coiled\r\n600 fathoms of rope, by sea to Lervik, and started in early July, with\r\nmy assistant, Dr. Bourne (afterwards Director of Education in the\r\nMadras Presidency), overland, via Copenhagen, for Christiania. Thence\r\nwe drove in \"carioles\" across Norway to Laerdalsören, on the west\r\ncoast, making acquaintance with the magnificent waters--rivers, lakes,\r\nand cascades--of that pine-grown land. After visiting the Naerodal\r\nand the glaciers which descend from the mountains into the sea on the\r\nFjaerlands Fiord, we took steamer to Lervik, and were welcomed at our\r\nfarmhouse by its owner, the sister of the member of Parliament for the\r\nsurrounding region (about four times the area of Yorkshire), whose son\r\nsecured for me a fair-sized sailing boat, and with two other men of\r\nLervik engaged as my crew for six weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--A portion of the branching tubular growth\r\nformed by Rhabdopleura Normani, fixed to and spreading over the smooth\r\nsurface of an Ascidian, dredged at Lervik and drawn of three times the\r\nnatural dimensions. The colourless tubes (b) stand up freely from the\r\nsurface to which the rest of the growth is adherent, and from each of\r\nthem issues in life (as seen at bb) a polyp such as that shown in Fig.\r\n2. Each polyp is continuous with the dark internal cord (or rod) which\r\nis seen traversing the whole of the tubular system. a, points to the\r\nmain and oldest portion of the branching stem; c, points to a \"leading\"\r\nshoot which is still adherent and will give rise to young buds right\r\nand left which will form upright tubes like b. The inset d represents\r\na piece of the tube magnified so as to show the rings by which it is\r\nbuilt up.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a day or two we had everything in order, and at seven o'clock\r\none morning sailed out of the harbour to make our first cast of the\r\ndredge. The mouth of the harbour of Lervik is 40 fathoms deep, and the\r\ngreat north-bound steamers enter it and come alongside the rocks\r\non which the village stands. Outside the harbour the depth increases\r\nprecipitously to 200 fathoms. We sailed about 10 miles along the fiord,\r\nand determined precisely the spot indicated by Dr. Norman on the map,\r\nand here we lowered our dredge. We had fixed around the mouth of the\r\ndredge long tassels of hemp fibre, since on rocky ground, such as we\r\nwere now dredging, one cannot expect much to be \"scooped up\" by the\r\nslowly travelling dredge as it passes over the bottom, whilst the\r\nthreads of the hemp, on the contrary, entangle and hold all sorts of\r\nobjects with which they come into contact. We were 1000 feet from the\r\nbottom, and our dredge took a good five minutes to sink as we paid\r\nout the rope from the winch in the stern of our boat. When it reached\r\nthe bottom we let out another 2000 feet of rope, and then very slowly\r\ntowed the dredge for about a quarter of an hour. Then the laborious\r\ntask commenced of winding it up again, two men turning the handles\r\nof the winch for a quarter of an hour. At last the dredge could be\r\nseen through the clear water, and soon was at the surface and lifted\r\ninto the boat. The hempen tangles were crowded with masses of living\r\nand dead white coral (Fig. 3), star-fishes, worms, and bits of stone\r\ncovered with brilliant-coloured sponges, Terebratulæ (a deep-water,\r\npeculiar shellfish, the lamp-shell), and other animals. There were only\r\na few fragments of coral in the bag of the dredge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--One of the polyps of Rhabdopleura which is\r\nattached by its soft contractile stalk (c) to the dark internal cord\r\nseen in Fig. 1. A similar polyp issues during life from the open end\r\nof each of the upright tubes seen in Fig. 1, and is, when disturbed,\r\npulled back into the tube by the contraction of the cord c. a, mouth;\r\nb, vent; c, contractile stalk; d, head-shield or disk; e, the left\r\ngill-plane; f, the body-mass enclosing the intestine, etc. (From a\r\ndrawing made by the author in Lervik, Stordö, in 1882.) For a full\r\naccount of Rhabdopleura, see the \"Quart. Journal of Microscopical\r\nScience,\" vol. xxiv., 1884.]\r\n\r\nWe filled glass jars with sea water and placed the bits of coral in\r\nthem, and I eagerly examined them for the creeper-like \"Rhabdopleura.\"\r\nThere, sure enough, it was on several of the dead stems of coral,\r\nand we sailed back to Lervik with our booty in order to examine it\r\nat leisure with the microscope whilst still fresh and living. In our\r\ntemporary laboratory at the farmhouse the little polyp which it had\r\nbeen my chief object to study, issued slowly from its delicate tubes\r\nwhen placed in a shallow trough of sea-water beneath the microscope.\r\nI was able on that day, and many others subsequently--with renewed\r\nsupplies from the depths of the fiord--to make coloured drawings of\r\nit, and to find out a great deal of interest to zoologists about its\r\nstructure. The minute thing (Fig. 2) was spotted with orange and black\r\nlike a leopard, and had a plume of tentacles on each side of its mouth,\r\nwhich was overhung by a mobile disk--the organ by means of which it\r\ncreeps slowly out of its tube, and also by which the transparent rings\r\nwhich form the tube are secreted and added one by one to the tube's\r\nmouth, so as to increase its length. The creature within the tree-like\r\nbranching system of tubes (Fig. 1) is also tree-like and branching,\r\nfifty or more polyp-like individuals terminating its branches and\r\nissuing each from one of the upstanding terminal branches of the tube\r\nsystem. I was able to determine the \"law\" of its budding and branching,\r\nand I also found the testis full of spermatozoa in several of the\r\npolyps, but I failed to find eggs. I believe that we were too late in\r\nthe season for them; and they are still unknown.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting deep-sea creatures discovered by the\r\n\"Challenger\" proved to be closely allied to our little Rhabdopleura,\r\nand received the name \"Cephalodiscus.\" Several species of this second\r\nkind have been discovered in the last twenty years in the deep sea,\r\nand the largest and most remarkable in some respects was one which\r\n\"jumped to my eyes\" among the booty of marine dredgings sent home from\r\nthe Antarctic expedition of the \"Discovery\" by Captain Scott, when I\r\nunpacked the cases containing these marine treasures, in the basement\r\nof the Natural History Museum. I published a photograph of it in\r\nthe \"Proceedings of the Royal Society,\" and named it \"Cephalodiscus\r\nnigrescens.\" But nothing more of importance has, as yet, been brought\r\nto light as to \"Rhabdopleura.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--A piece of the white branching coral\r\n(Lophohelia prolifera) dredged in great quantity by the author off\r\nLervik in 1882. Drawn of the natural size.]\r\n\r\nOur rule at Lervik was to go out dredging from seven to twelve, and\r\nwork at the material with microscope and pencil for some three or\r\nfour hours after lunch. Of all the many beautiful things we dredged,\r\nthe most striking were the various kinds of corals, the large,\r\nglass-like shrimps, the strange apple-green worm Hamingia (actually\r\nknown previously by two specimens only), and the large, disc-like and\r\nbranched, sand-covered or sausage-like Protozoa (from a shelly bottom\r\nof 200 fathoms depth). My friend Dr. Norman joined me at Lervik after\r\nI had been there for a month, and showed his extraordinary skill in\r\nchoosing the most favourable spots for sinking the dredge and in\r\npouncing on interesting specimens as we sorted the contents of the\r\ndredge (when we had been on a soft bottom) by passing them through the\r\nsieves, specially provided for naturalists' use, as we gently rocked on\r\nthe dark surface of the clear, deep water, many miles from our island.\r\nThe colours and light of that region are wonderful--the mountains of a\r\nyellow tint, far paler than the purple sea, whilst the rocky islands\r\nare fringed with seaweed of rich orange-brown colour, and clothed with\r\ngrass and innumerable flowers.\r\n\r\nThe white coral of two kinds (Lophohelia and Amphihelia) is accompanied\r\nby beautiful purple and salmon-coloured softer kinds of coral\r\n(Alcyonarians), known as Primnoa, and by the gigantic Paragorgia. On\r\none occasion our dredge became fast. For long nothing would move it,\r\nand we feared we should have to cut it and lose some 300 fathoms of\r\nrope. At last the efforts of four men at the oars set it free, and we\r\nwound it in. As the dredge came up we found entangled in the rope an\r\nenormous tree-like growth, as thick as a man's arm, seven feet long,\r\nand spreading out into branches, the whole of a pale vermilion colour\r\n(like pink lacquer)--a magnificent sight! It was a branch of the great\r\ntree-coral of these waters--the Paragorgia--and we preserved many\r\npieces of it in alcohol and dried the rest. But the gorgeous colour\r\ncould not be retained.\r\n\r\nOne day the green worm, Hamingia (named after a Norwegian hero--Haming)\r\nwas dredged by us at the mouth of Lervik Harbour, in 40 fathoms. A\r\nsomewhat similar worm lives in holes in the limestone rocks of the\r\nMediterranean, and is named Bonellia (after the Italian naturalist,\r\nBonelli). All the specimens of this Mediterranean worm, which is as\r\nlarge as a big walnut, and has a trunk, or proboscis, a foot long,\r\nwere found to be females. The male was unknown until my friend the\r\nlate Alexander Kowalewsky, the most remarkable of Russian zoologists,\r\ndiscovered that it is a tiny threadlike green creature, no bigger than\r\nthe letter \"i\" on this page. Three or four are found crawling about on\r\nthe body of the large female. I found the same diminutive kind of male\r\ncrawling on my Norwegian Hamingia, at Lervik, and published a drawing\r\nand description of him. I was also able to show that, unlike Bonellia,\r\nthe Norwegian worm has red blood-corpuscles, like those of a frog, and\r\nimpregnated with hæmoglobin, the same oxygen-carrying substance which\r\ncolours our own blood-corpuscles. The identity of the worm's hæmoglobin\r\nwith that in our own blood was proved by its causing two dark bands of\r\nabsorption in the solar spectrum when light was passed through it and\r\nthen through the spectroscope--dark bands exactly the same in position\r\nand intensity as those caused by the red substance of my own blood and\r\nchanging into one single band intermediate in position between the\r\ntwo--when deprived by an appropriate chemical of the oxygen loosely\r\ncombined with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On the Fiord near Lervik.]\r\n\r\nOf many other things we caught and many other delights of that\r\nlong-past summer on the Norwegian fiords, of the great waterfalls, the\r\nvast forests, the delightful swimming in the sea, the trout-fishing,\r\nand the very trying food approved and provided for us by the natives,\r\nI must not now tell. My hope is that I may have enabled my readers to\r\nunderstand some of the enjoyment open to the marine zoologist, even\r\nwhen he dispenses with the aid of a big steamship, and modestly pursues\r\nhis quarry in a sportsmanlike spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nNATURE-RESERVES\r\n\r\n\r\nONE of the new features of modern life--the result of the enormous\r\ndevelopment of the newspaper press and the vast increase in numbers of\r\nthose who read and think in common--is the development of a sensitive\r\n\"self-consciousness\" of the community, a more or less successful\r\neffort to know its own history, to value the records of the past,\r\nand to question its own hitherto unconscious, unreflecting attitude\r\nin mechanically and as it were blindly destroying everything which\r\ngets in the way of that industrial and commercial activity which\r\nis regarded, erroneously, as identical with \"progress.\" Beautiful\r\nold houses and strange buildings--priceless records of the ways and\r\nthought of our early ancestors---which at one time were either guarded\r\nby superstitious reverence or let alone because there was room for\r\nthem and for everything else in the spacious countryside---have been\r\nthoughtlessly pulled down as population and grasping enterprise\r\nincreased. The really graceful old houses of London and other towns,\r\nlovingly produced by former men who were true artists, have been broken\r\nup and their panelling and chimney-pieces sold to foreigners in order\r\nto make way for more commodious buildings, hideous in their ignorant\r\ndecoration, or brutally \"run up,\" gaunt, bare, and mis-shapen. The\r\nstones of Avebury, of Stonehenge, and of many another temple have been\r\nknocked to pieces by emancipated country-folk--no longer restrained\r\neither by superstition or by reverence--to mend roads and to make\r\nenclosures.\r\n\r\nHappily the new self-consciousness is taking note of these things.\r\nThat strange lumbering body which we call \"the mother of parliaments\"\r\nhas dimly reflected the better thought of the community, and given a\r\nfeeble sort of protection to ancient monuments. The newspapers have\r\nlately managed to excite some public interest in a fine old house in\r\nDean Street, Soho, and to arouse a feeling of shame that the richest\r\ncity in the richest Empire of the world should allow the few remnants\r\nof beautiful things of the past still existing in its midst to be\r\ndestroyed by the uncontrolled operation of mercenary \"progress.\" I\r\nhave, in common with many others, visited this doomed mansion. It is\r\na charming old place, of no great size or importance, and, with its\r\nwell-proportioned panelled rooms and fine staircase, was destined to\r\nbe a private residence. It is not large enough to be a museum, but\r\nits rooms might serve for the show place of a first-rate maker or\r\nvender of things of fine workmanship. There ought to be some public\r\nauthority--municipal or departmental--with power to acquire such\r\ninteresting houses as this, not necessarily to convert them into\r\npermanent public shows, but to keep them in repair, and to let them\r\non lease, at a reasonable rent, to tenants, subject to the condition\r\nof their being open on certain days in the year to artists and others\r\nprovided with orders of admission by the authority. In other countries\r\nsuch arrangements are made; with us they are not made simply because\r\nwe have not assigned to any authority the duty of acting in this way\r\nfor the public benefit. Our public authorities have little or no public\r\nspirit, and resemble private committees, councils, and individuals\r\nin evading and refusing even the smallest increase of responsibility\r\nand activity beyond that which they are compelled by law to discharge.\r\nUnless they are legally compelled to interfere, all records of art and\r\nnature may perish before they will incur the inconvenience of moving a\r\nfinger! Consequently the only thing to be done is to assign such duties\r\nby law to an existing authority, or to one created for such purposes.\r\n\r\nThe same tale of destruction and irreparable damage has to be told of\r\nour dealings with the beauty of once unsullied moorland, meadow, marsh,\r\nforest, river-bank, and seashore. But the destruction has here been\r\nmore gradual, less obvious on account of remoteness, and more subtle\r\nin its creeping, insinuating method, like that of a slowly-spreading\r\ninfective disease. The word \"country\" has to a very large extent ceased\r\nto signify to us \"outlying nature beyond the man-made town,\" occupied\r\nonly in little tracts here and there by the immemorial tillers of the\r\nsoil. The splendid and age-long industry of our field-workers has made\r\nmuch of our land a garden. Now they themselves are disappearing or\r\nchanged beyond recognition, losing their traditional arts and crafts,\r\ntheir distinctive and venerable dialects, and their individuality.\r\nThe land is enclosed, drained, manured; food plants produced by the\r\nagriculturist replace the native plants; forests are cut down and\r\nconverted into parks and pheasant-runs; foreign trees are substituted\r\nfor those native to the soil. Commons, heaths, and wild moorlands have\r\nbeen enclosed by eager land-grabbers, the streams are polluted by\r\nmining or chemical works, or if kept clean are artificially overstocked\r\nwith hand-fed trout; whilst the open roads reek of tar and petroleum.\r\nThe \"wilderness\" is fast disappearing, and it is by this name that\r\nwe must distinguish from the mere \"country,\" as much besmirched and\r\ndevastated by man as are the sites of his towns and cities, the regions\r\nwhere untouched nature still survives and is free from the depredations\r\nof humanity. Many beautiful and rare plants which once inhabited our\r\ncountryside have perished; many larger animals (such as wolf, beaver,\r\nred-deer, marten-cats, and wild-cats) have disappeared, as well as many\r\ninsects, great and small, such as the swallow-tailed butterfly and the\r\nlarger copper butterfly, and many splendid birds.\r\n\r\nHere and there in these islands are to be found bits of \"wilderness\"\r\nwhere some of the ancient life--now so rapidly being destroyed--still\r\nflourishes. There are some coast-side marshes, there are East\r\nAnglian fens, some open heath-land, and some bits of forest which\r\nare yet unspoilt, unravaged by blighting, reckless humanity. It is\r\na distressing fact that some of the recent official attempts to\r\npreserve open forest land and commons for the public enjoyment have\r\nbeen accompanied by a mistaken attempt to drain them, and lay them\r\nout with gravel walks, to the complete destruction of their natural\r\nbeauty and interest. The bog above the Leg of Mutton Pond, on Hampstead\r\nHeath, where I used to visit, years ago, the bog-bean and the sun-dew,\r\nand many a moss-grown pool swarming with rare animalcules, has been\r\ndrained by an over-zealous board of guardians, animated by a suburban\r\nenthusiasm for turf and gravel paths. The same spirit, hostile to\r\nnature and eager to reduce the wilderness to vulgar conventionality,\r\nhas tamed the finer parts of Wimbledon Common, and is busy laying\r\ndown gravel paths in Epping Forest. In the New Forest the clamour\r\nof the neighbouring residents for \"sport\" has led to the framing of\r\nregulations by the officials of the Crown (it is a \"Royal\" forest),\r\nwhich are resulting in the destruction and disappearance of rare\r\nbirds which formerly nested there. Many a distant common threatened\r\nby the builder has been preserved as an open space by golfers. Such\r\npreservation is like that of the boards of conservators, useless\r\nfrom the point of view of the nature-lover. The health-seeking crowd\r\nspreads devastation around it. The rare sand-loving plants of the\r\ndunes, and the \"bog-bean,\" the \"sun-dew,\" and other refugees from human\r\npersecution on our once unfrequented heath-lands, are remorselessly\r\ntrodden down or hacked up by the golfer. Other destroyers of nature's\r\nrarer products are those who greedily search for them and carry them\r\noff, root and branch, to the last specimen, in order to sell them.\r\nThese dealers are \"collectors,\" indeed, but must not be confused with\r\nthe genuine \"naturalist,\" who may allow himself, with due modesty, to\r\nsecure a limited sample of treasures from nature's open hand.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances a society has been founded for the formation\r\nof \"nature-reserves\" in the British Islands. Its object is to secure,\r\nby purchase or gift, tracts of as yet unsullied wilderness--of which\r\nsome are still, though rarely, to be found--where beast and bird,\r\ninsect and plant are still living as of old--untouched, unmolested,\r\nundisturbed by intrusive, murderous man. The society's object is to\r\nenter into relations with those who may know of such tracts, and to\r\narrange for their transference--if of sufficient interest--to the\r\nNational Trust. The expense of proper guardianship and the admission\r\nto the reserve of duly authorized persons would be the business of the\r\nsociety. Its office is at the Natural History Museum in Cromwell Road,\r\nand Mr. Ogilvie Grant, the naturalist in charge of the ornithological\r\ncollections, is one of the secretaries. Sir Edward Grey and Mr. Lewis\r\nHarcourt and several of our most distinguished botanists and zoologists\r\nare members of the council. All who sympathize with the objects of the\r\nsociety should write to the secretary for further information.\r\n\r\nAlready two tracts of land were secured as nature-reserves before\r\nthe society came into existence. One of these is Wickham Fen, not\r\nfar from Cambridge, renowned for its remarkable plants and insects.\r\nIt was purchased and placed in the hands of the National Trust by a\r\npublic-spirited entomologist. Another reserve, which has been secured,\r\nis far away on the links or dunes of the north coast of Norfolk,\r\nand is of especial interest to botanists. No one--either golfer or\r\nbungalow-builder--can now interfere there and destroy the interwoven\r\nflora and fauna, the members of which balance and protect, encourage\r\nand check one another, as is Nature's method. The interaction of\r\nthe various species of wild plants in this undisturbed spot is made\r\nthe subject of continual and careful study by the botanists who are\r\npermitted to frequent it. More such \"reserves\" and of different\r\ncharacters are desirable. Should we, of the present day, succeed in\r\nsecuring some great marsh-land, one or more rocky headlands or islands,\r\nand a good sweep of Scotch moor and mountain, and in raising money to\r\nprovide guardians for these acquisitions, we shall not only enjoy them\r\nourselves but be blessed by future generations of men for having saved\r\nsomething of Britain's ancient nature, when all else, which is not\r\ncity, will have become manure, shooting greens, and pleasure gardens.\r\n\r\nIn Germany and in Switzerland a good deal has been done in this way.\r\nOwing to the existence of \"forestry\" and a State Forest Department\r\nin Germany--which has no representative in this country--there is\r\nmachinery for selecting and guarding such \"reserves.\" A large sum is\r\nassigned annually by the Government to this purpose. Last year an\r\ninternational congress, attended by delegates from the English society,\r\nas well as by representatives of many other States, was held, and much\r\nuseful discussion as to methods and results took place.\r\n\r\nThe notion of creating a nature-reserve on a small scale seems to\r\nhave originated with Charles Waterton, the traveller and naturalist,\r\nwho in the middle of last century converted the estate surrounding\r\nhis residence near Pontefract in Yorkshire into a sort of sanctuary,\r\nwhere he made it a strict rule that no wild thing should be molested.\r\nFor some years now the attempt to create \"nature-reserves,\" on a far\r\nlarger scale than those of which I have been writing, has been made\r\nwhere civilization is planting its first settlements in primeval\r\nforest and prairie. The United States Government, impressed with the\r\nrapid destruction and disappearance both of forests and of native\r\nanimals which have accompanied the opening up by road and rail of vast\r\nterritories in the West, created in 1872 the national \"reserve,\" called\r\nthe Yellowstone Park, which is some 3300 square miles in area. We are\r\nassured that here under proper guardianship the larger native animals\r\nare increasing in number; whilst the great coniferous trees, which were\r\nin danger of extermination by the white man, are safe. Similar reserves\r\nhave been proclaimed in parts of Africa under British control, but\r\nthough that known as Mount Elgon--an ancient volcanic cup, clad with\r\nforest, and ten miles in diameter--seems to have been effective, and to\r\nhave furnished in Sir Harry Johnston's time, ten years ago, a refuge\r\nfor the giraffe, it is scarcely possible, at present, to provide an\r\nefficient police force to protect areas of something like 1000 square\r\nmiles against the depredations of native and commercial \"hunters\"\r\nprovided with modern rifles.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1900, I was, with the late Sir Clement Hill, appointed\r\n\"plenipotentiary\" by her Majesty Queen Victoria to meet representatives\r\nof Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, and the Congo States in a\r\nconference, presided over by the late Marquis of Linlithgow, at the\r\nForeign Office. The conference was arranged by the great African\r\npowers in order to consider and report on the means to be taken to\r\npreserve the big game animals of Africa from extinction. We spent an\r\nextremely interesting fortnight, and finally agreed upon a report, the\r\nupshot of which was that whilst certain animals, such as the giraffe,\r\nsome zebras and antelopes, the gorilla, and such useful birds as the\r\nvultures, secretary bird, owls, and the cow-pickers (Buphagus), should\r\nbe absolutely protected, others should be only protected at certain\r\nseasons, or in youth, or in limited numbers, and others again should\r\nbe killed without licence or restraint at any time, such being the\r\nlion, the leopard, the hunting-dog, destructive baboons, most birds\r\nof prey, crocodiles, pythons, and poisonous snakes. The question of\r\nlarge \"nature-reserves\" was discussed. It was agreed that such reserves\r\nshould be maintained for the breeding-places and rearing of the young\r\nof desirable animals, and that the destruction of predatory animals or\r\nan excess of other forms should be permitted to the administrators of\r\nsuch reserves. Thus it is clear that no absolute \"nature-reserves\" were\r\nconsidered possible.\r\n\r\nIn fact this is the case whether the reserve be large or small. Once\r\nman is present in the neighbourhood, even at a long distance, he upsets\r\nthe \"balance of Nature.\" The naturalist's small \"nature-reserve\" may be\r\nravaged by predatory animals driven from the outlying region occupied\r\nby man, or again, the absence from the \"reserve\" of predatory animals\r\nwhich act as natural checks on the increase of other animals, may lead\r\nto excessive and unhealthy multiplication of the latter. Man must\r\n\"weed\" and artificially manage his \"reserve\" after all! Man brings\r\nalso into the neighbourhood of reserves, great and small, disease\r\ngerms in his domesticated animals, which are carried by insects into\r\nthe cherished \"reserve,\" and there cause destruction. Conversely,\r\nthe animals maintained in a reserve carry in their blood microscopic\r\nparasites to the poisons of which they have become immune by natural\r\nselection in the course of ages. They act as \"reservoirs\" of such\r\nmicroscopic germs. These germs carried by flies or other insects to the\r\ncarefully reared cattle imported by civilized man from other regions\r\nof the world into the neighbourhood of such \"reserves,\" cause deadly\r\ndisease (such as the tsetse-fly diseases or trypanosome diseases)\r\nto those imported cattle, as also to man himself. Whilst, then, we\r\nmay do something to retain small tracts of our own country in the\r\nmodified state which it attained after the earlier inhabitants had\r\ndestroyed lion, bear, wolf, and other noxious animals, as well as great\r\nherbivora, such as giant deer, red deer, aurochs (or great bull), and\r\nbison--yet in reality a true \"Nature-reserve\" is not compatible with\r\nthe occupation of the land, within some hundreds of miles of it, by\r\ncivilized, or even semi-civilized, man.\r\n\r\nNothing but the isolation given by a wide sea or high mountain ranges\r\nwill preserve a primeval fauna and flora--the indigenous man-free\r\nliving denizens of the isolated region--from destruction by the\r\nnecessary unpremeditated disturbance of Nature's balance by man once he\r\nhas passed from the lowest stage of savagery. At present we are faced\r\nby this difficulty in Africa. Not only the white settlers have large\r\nherds of cattle, but before their arrival the native races had imported\r\nIndian cattle. These cattle are destroyed by \"fly disease,\" the germs\r\n(trypanosomes) being carried by the tsetse-fly to the domesticated\r\ncattle from wild buffalo which swarm with the germs but are uninjured\r\nby them. Consequently, if the rich pasture lands of Africa--at present\r\nunutilized--are to be occupied by herdsmen, the wild game, buffalo and\r\nantelopes, must be destroyed. In many regions they have been destroyed.\r\nIs this destruction to be continued? If Africa is to be the seat of a\r\nmodern human population and supply food to other parts of the world,\r\nthe whole \"balance of Nature\" there must be upset and the big wild\r\nanimals destroyed. There is no alternative. The practical question\r\nis, \"How far is it possible to mitigate this process?\" Can a great\r\nAfrican \"reserve\" of 100,000 square miles be established in a position\r\nso isolated that it shall not be a source of disease and danger to the\r\nherdsmen and agriculturists of adjacent territory?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME men of unbalanced minds have lately proposed deliberately and\r\ncompletely to obliterate all the artistic work of past generations of\r\nman in order, as they openly profess, that they themselves and their\r\nown productions may obtain consideration. Even were they able to make\r\nsuch a clearance, it may be doubted whether the consideration given to\r\ntheir own performances would be favourable. These obscure individuals\r\nhave immodestly dubbed themselves \"futurists,\" and the name has been\r\nat once adopted as a mystification and advertisement by a variety\r\nof art-posers--probably unknown to the originators of the word--who\r\nhave ventured into one or other of the fields of art without even\r\nthe smallest gift, either of conception or of expression, or even of\r\nimitation. They receive undeserved attention from a section of the\r\npublic ready to dabble in every newly-made puddle. I am led to refer\r\nto them because the abolition of the supremely beautiful things slowly\r\nevolved by Nature in the long course of ages, and the substitution for\r\nthem of man's fancy breeds and races and garden paths, is not merely a\r\nparallel piece of folly, but is due to a mental defect identical with\r\nthat of the genuine \"futurist,\" namely, an intellectual incapacity\r\nwhich renders its victim insensible to the charm of historical and\r\nevolutional complexity.\r\n\r\nThe modern man who nourishes a real love for undistorted nature--that\r\nis to say, who is a true \"naturalist\"--has one or two resources even in\r\nthese British Islands. There are ways of access to Nature unadorned by\r\nman which are open even to the town-dweller. The chief of these is the\r\nseashore. Even from London, in the course of a few hours, one may be\r\ntransported to territory where there are no traces of man's operations.\r\nThe region of rock and pool, sand-flat, and shell-bank, exposed by\r\nthe sea as it retreats, is a real \"nature-reserve\"--effectually so is\r\nthat deepest area only exposed at spring-tides. The locality chosen\r\nby the naturalist must be at a distance from any great harbour or\r\nestuary polluted by the cities seated on its banks, and should also\r\nbe out of the way of the modern steam-driven fish trawlers, which\r\nhave caused havoc in some sweet bays of our southern coast by pouring\r\nout tons of dead, unsaleable fish. The rejected offal has become the\r\ngathering-ground of carnivorous marine creatures, and the balance of\r\nNature has been upset by the nourishment thus thoughtlessly thrown by\r\nman into new relations.\r\n\r\nSome favoured spot on the south or west coast may be known to our\r\ncity-dwelling nature-lover, and thither he will hasten to spend\r\nweek-ends, and, when he can, longer spells in the supreme delight of\r\nundisturbed communion with the things of Nature, apart from human\r\n\"enterprise.\" In some cottage near the sea marsh, where an unpolluted\r\nstream joins the salt water, he has his accustomed lodging; his host, a\r\ncheery long-shore fisherman and handy boatman. Close by is the rising\r\nheadland and rocky cliff facing the sea. The shore is strewn with\r\nrocks, and as the tide goes down long \"reefs\" are exposed, clothed\r\nwith brown and green seaweeds. Here no man has intruded! When the\r\nwater recedes still farther, pools and miniature caverns appear,\r\nedged with delicate feathery red-coloured seaweeds. Many small fishes,\r\nshrimps of various kinds, sometimes pale rainbow-tinted \"squids\"\r\n(one of the more delicate cuttle-fishes), are seen darting about the\r\npools, changing their colour with lightning rapidity. The overhanging\r\nsides of the rock-pools give protection to gorgeously-coloured\r\n\"sea-anemones\" adhering to them. Here, also, are those exquisite\r\nascidians--ill-described by the rough name \"sea-squirt\"--hanging from\r\nthe rocks like drops of purest crystal in their transparency--for which\r\nnaturalists use the prettier title \"Clavellina.\" The nature-lover now\r\nturns one of the large flat slabs of rock lying in such a pool--well\r\nknowing what loveliness its under-side will reveal to his eyes. That\r\nunder-side is studded with a dozen or two of the most exquisite gems of\r\ngreen and peach colour, ruby and yellow (Corynactis by name!), which,\r\nif the slab of stone is left beneath the water, expand and display each\r\nits circlet of brilliant little tentacles. They are sea-anemones no\r\nbigger than the precious stone in a signet-ring. Among them a bright\r\nsalmon-coloured worm hastens with serpentine movement and the rippling\r\nstrokes of a hundred feathery feet to escape from the unaccustomed\r\nlight. A deep blood-red coloured prawn (Alpheus) darts from concealment\r\nand hastily buries itself in the sandy bottom of the pool, snapping\r\nits pincerlike claw with a sharp cracking sound. A couple of bivalved\r\nshells (Lima hians) which were concealed beneath the slab swim lazily\r\nround the pool by opening and closing their delicate white \"valves\"--an\r\nunusual kind of activity in such mussels, oysters, and clams--whilst\r\na fringe of long orange-red tentacles trails in the water from each\r\nof them. The lifting of another rock may dislodge an \"octopus\"--or a\r\nhuge brilliantly-coloured star-fish--or one of the rarer kinds of\r\ncrab eager to avoid the observation of the octopus, of which it is the\r\nregular food. A spade pushed into the neighbouring sandbanks reveals\r\nheart-urchins, gorgeous sea-worms, and burrowing shell-fish and perhaps\r\nsand-eels. The human visitor--bending over these scenes of wonderment\r\nand perhaps venturing to transfer one or two only of the less familiar\r\nanimals to a glass jar filled with sea-water so that he may see them\r\nmore clearly--at last stands up and straightens his back, gazing over\r\nthe sun-bathed scene from the tumbled weed-grown rocks, encrusted\r\nwith crowds of purple-blue mussels, to the patches of golden sand,\r\nclear pools, and the blue sea beyond. Then he may note (as I have) a\r\ncurious rhythmical sound if he is among rocks covered with seaweeds--a\r\nquiet but incessant \"hiss-hiss,\" which is heard above the deeper-toned\r\nlapping of the little waves among the big stones. This is the sound\r\nmade by the rasp-like tongues of the periwinkles feeding on the\r\nabundant weed, over which they crawl, leaving the water and \"browsing\"\r\non the surface exposed to the air by the fall of the tide. The browsing\r\nsound of these little snails is to the seashore what the humming of\r\nbees is to inland meadows.\r\n\r\nDay after day and at various seasons of the year the nature-lover will\r\nvisit this sanctuary, and, whilst contemplating the lovely forms,\r\ncolour, and movement of its denizens, will learn the secrets of\r\ntheir life, of their comings and goings, and the mysteries of their\r\nreproduction, their birth, and their childhood. Each day he finds\r\nsomething unknown to his brother naturalists. He will examine it with\r\nhis lens, paint it in all its beauty, and tell of it in due course in\r\nprinted page and coloured portraiture; but he is no mere seeker for\r\nnovelty, nor is the credit of discovery the motive of his devotion.\r\nBeyond and greater than any such gains are the incomparable delight,\r\nthe never-failing happiness which personal intimacy with the secret\r\nthings of natural beauty bring to him.\r\n\r\nHe has yet another chance of such enjoyment, if he be a microscopist,\r\nand familiar with the inhabitants of fresh-water ponds. A pond is,\r\nin many cases, an oasis in the waste of civilization, a miniature\r\nnature-reserve, rarely, if ever, affected by human proceedings until\r\nhaply it is abolished altogether. A fairly deep, stagnant pond under\r\ntrees in some secluded park is one of the most favourable kind, but all\r\nsorts deserve inquiry (even the rain pools on the roofs of old houses\r\nin Paris have rewarded the faithful seeker), and may prove, for a time\r\nat least, havens of refuge for a wonderful assemblage of animalcules\r\nand minute microscopic plants, which for the most part perish as did\r\nthe bison of the American plains by the mere disturbance caused by\r\nthe propinquity of civilized man. I knew such a pond--it is now built\r\nover--near Hampstead. As one lay on the bank and peered into the depths\r\nof the pond the transparent, glass-like larvæ of the \"plume fly\"\r\n(Corethra) could be seen swimming in the clear water, driving before\r\nit troops of minute pink-coloured water-fleas (Daphnia) and other\r\ncrustaceans.\r\n\r\nIn other parts the water was made bluish-green by crowds of the little\r\nfloating spherical animalcules called \"Volvox globator.\" The mud\r\ncontained many curious worms allied to the earth-worm, whilst coiled\r\nround fallen twigs were the small snake-like worms known as \"Nais\r\nserpentina.\" Desmids, Diatoms, and animalcules of endless variety\r\nabounded. A muslin net set on a ring on the end of a stick enabled one\r\nto procure samples of the floating life of the water and also to skim\r\nthe surface of the mud, and these spoils were brought home in bottles\r\nand searched for hours drop by drop with the microscope. The world of\r\nactive, graceful, bustling life thus revealed as one gazes for hours\r\nthrough the magic tube of the microscope, is as remote from human\r\ncivilization as that uncovered at low tide on the seashore. Many a\r\nworried City man, amongst them a great political writer on the staff of\r\na London daily, now passed from among us, has found in this microscopic\r\nworld--so readily accessible even at his own study table--a release\r\nfrom care, a refreshing contact with unadulterated natural things of\r\nlife and beauty. My friend, Iwan Müller, the writer referred to, was as\r\ndiscriminating a judge of the shapes of wheel-animalcules as he was of\r\nthe faces of the politicians of Europe and South Africa!\r\n\r\nThere is another and much more difficult escape from the grip and taint\r\nof civilization, which is that effected by the explorer who penetrates\r\ninto sparsely inhabited wilds such as those of the Australian\r\ncontinent. Man is there, but in such small number (one to every 450\r\nsquare miles!), and in so primitive and childlike a state, that he is\r\nnot a disturbing element, but simply one of the \"fauna\"--one of the\r\ncurious animals living there under the domination of Nature--not yet\r\n\"Nature's rebel,\" but submissive, unconscious, and a more fascinating\r\nstudy for us than any other of her products. He shows us what manner\r\nof men were our own remote ancestors. The hunters who have left their\r\nflint implements in the earlier river gravels of Western Europe were\r\nsuch men as these Australian natives now are. Naked, using only sticks\r\nand chipped stones as implements and weapons, destitute of crops or\r\nherds or habitations, wandering from place to place in keen search of\r\nfood--small animals, birds, lizards, and grubs--these Australians have\r\nnone of the arts of the most primitive among other races, excepting\r\nthat they can make fire and construct a canoe of the bark of trees.\r\nThey have not even the bow and arrow, but make use of spears and the\r\nwonderful \"boomerang\" in hunting and fighting. They daub themselves\r\nwith a sort of white paint, and decorate their bodies with great\r\nscars made by cutting gashes in the flesh with sharp stones, and\r\nthey dress their heads and faces and ceremonial wands with wool and\r\nfeathers, which they fix by the aid of an adhesive fluid always ready\r\nto hand--namely, their own blood. I recently was present at a lecture\r\ngiven to the Anthropological Institute in London by Professor Baldwin\r\nSpencer, of Melbourne, with whom I was closely associated when he was\r\na student at Oxford thirty years ago. He has devoted many years to the\r\nstudy of the Australian natives, and ten years ago published a most\r\nvaluable work describing his experiences amongst them, to which he has\r\nrecently added a further volume. He has lived with them in friendship\r\nand intimacy in the remote wilderness of the Australian bush, and has\r\nbeen admitted as a member of one of their mysterious clans, of which\r\nthe \"totem,\" or supposed spirit-ancestor, is \"the witchety grub\"--a\r\nkind of caterpillar. He has been freely admitted to their secret\r\nceremonies as well as to their more public \"corroborees\" or dances,\r\nand has been able (as no one else has been), without annoyance or\r\noffence to them, to take a great number of cinema-films of them in\r\ntheir various dances or when cooking in camp or paddling and upsetting\r\ntheir canoes, and climbing back again from the river. Many of these he\r\nexhibited to us, and we found ourselves among moving crowds of these\r\nslim-legged, beautifully-shaped wild men. The film presented some of\r\ntheir strange elaborate dances, which soon will be danced no more.\r\nThese wild men die out when civilized man comes near them. It appears\r\nthat they really spend most of their time in dancing when not looking\r\nfor food or chipping stone implements, and that their dances are\r\nessentially plays (like those of little children in Europe), the acting\r\nof traditional stories relating the history of their venerated animal\r\n\"totem,\" which often last for three weeks at a time! Whilst dancing and\r\ngesticulating they are chanting and singing without cessation, often\r\nrepeating the same words over and over again. Here, indeed, we have\r\nthe primitive human art, the emotional expression from which, in more\r\nadvanced races, music, drama, dancing, and decorative handicraft have\r\ndeveloped as separate \"arts.\"\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable and impressive result was obtained when Professor\r\nBaldwin Spencer turned on his phonograph records whilst the wild men\r\ndanced in the film picture. Then we heard the actual voices of these\r\nsurvivors of prehistoric days--shouting at us in weird cadences,\r\nimitating the cry of birds, and accompanied by the booming of the\r\nbull-roarer (a piece of wood attached to a string, and swung rapidly\r\nround by the performer). A defect, and at the same time a special\r\nmerit, of the cinema show of the present day is the deadly silence of\r\nboth the performers and the spectators. Screams and oaths are delivered\r\nin silence; pistols are fired without a sound. One can concentrate\r\none's observation on the facial expression and movements of the actors\r\nwith undivided attention and with no fear of startling detonations.\r\nAnd very bad they almost invariably are, except in films made by the\r\ngreat French producers. On the other hand, I was astonished at the\r\nintensity of the impression produced by hearing the actual voices of\r\nthose Australian wild men as they danced in rhythm with their songs.\r\nTo hear is a greater means of revelation than to see. One feels even\r\ncloser to those Australian natives as their strange words and songs\r\nissue from imprisonment in the phonograph, than when one sees them\r\nin the film pictures actually beating time with feet and hands and\r\nimitating the movements of animals. To receive, as one sits in a London\r\nlecture-room, the veritable appeal of these remote and inaccessible\r\nthings to both the eye and the ear simultaneously, is indeed the most\r\nthrilling experience I can remember. With a feeling of awe, almost of\r\nterror, we recognize as we gaze at and listen to the records brought\r\nhome by Professor Baldwin Spencer that we are intruding into a vast and\r\nprimitive Nature-reserve where even humanity itself is still in the\r\nstate of childhood--submissive to the great mother, without the desire\r\nto destroy her control or the power to substitute man's handiwork for\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT GREY SEAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is always pleasing to find that intelligent care can be brought to\r\nbear on the preservation of the rare and interesting animals which\r\nstill inhabit parts of these British Islands, though it is not often\r\nthat such care is actually exercised. Mr. Lyell (a nephew of the great\r\ngeologist Sir Charles Lyell) in April 1914 introduced a Bill into the\r\nHouse of Commons which is called the Grey Seals (Protection) Bill. It\r\ncame on for consideration before the Standing Committee, was ordered to\r\nbe reported to the House without amendment, and has now passed into law.\r\n\r\nThe Great Grey Seal is a much bigger animal than the Common Seal, the\r\ntwo species being the only seals which can be properly called \"British\"\r\nat the present day, though occasionally the Harp Seal, or Greenland\r\nSeal, and the Bladder-nosed Seal are seen in British waters, and may\r\nemerge from those waters on to rocky shores or lonely sandbanks. The\r\nGreat Grey Seal is called \"Halichœrus grypus\" by zoologists, whilst\r\nthe Common Seal is known as \"Phoca vitulina.\" The male of the former\r\nspecies grows to be as much as 10 feet in length, whilst that of the\r\nCommon Seal rarely attains 5 feet. Both these seals breed on the\r\nBritish coast. The Common Seal frequents the north circumpolar region,\r\nbeing found on the northern coasts on both sides of the Atlantic,\r\nand also on both sides of the Pacific, and even makes its way down\r\nthe coasts of France and Spain into the Mediterranean, where it is\r\nrare. A few years ago one appeared on the beach at Brighton! It may\r\noften be seen on the west coast of Scotland, of Ireland, Wales, and\r\nCornwall, where it breeds in caves. Its hairy coat is silky, and has a\r\nyellowish-grey tint spotted with black and dark grey, most abundantly\r\non the back.\r\n\r\nThe Great Grey Seal does not occur in the Pacific, but is limited to\r\nthe northern shores on both sides of the Atlantic. Its coat is of a\r\nmore uniform greyish-brown colour than that of the Common Seal, and\r\nwhen dried by exposure to the sun has a silvery-grey sheen. The Great\r\nGrey Seal is a good deal rarer on our coasts than is the Common Seal.\r\nIt is now limited to the south, west, and north coasts of Ireland, to\r\nthe great islands on the West of Scotland, the Orkneys, the Shetlands,\r\nand some spots on the east coast of Scotland. It is heard of as a rare\r\nvisitor to the Lincolnshire \"Wash,\" the coasts of Norfolk, Cornwall,\r\nand Wales. Some years ago (in 1883) I found a newly-born Grey Seal on\r\nthe shore of Pentargon Cove, near Boscastle, North Cornwall. It appears\r\nthat whilst (contrary to the statements of some writers) the Common\r\nSeal produces its young most usually in caves or rock-shelters, the\r\nGreat Grey Seal chooses a remote sand island or deserted piece of open\r\nshore for its nursery. The Common Seal gives birth to its young--a\r\nsingle one or a pair--in June; the Great Grey Seal about the 1st of\r\nSeptember. While the young in both species is clothed when born in a\r\ncoat of long yellowish-white hair, this coat is shed in the case of\r\nthe Common Seal within twenty-four hours of birth, exposing the short\r\nhair, forming a smooth, silky coat, as in the adult, and the young\r\nat once takes to the water and swims. On the other hand, the long\r\nyellowish-white coat of hair persists in the young of the Great Grey\r\nSeal for six or seven weeks, during which time it remains on shore, and\r\nrefuses to enter the water. It is visited at sundown by the mother for\r\nthe purpose of suckling it. According to Mr. Lyell, this renders the\r\nyoung of the Great Grey Seal peculiarly liable to attack by reckless\r\ndestructive humanity, and he accordingly proposes legislation to render\r\nit a penal offence to destroy the young seals or the mothers during the\r\nnursing season. It is estimated that the total number of Great Grey\r\nSeals in Scottish waters has been reduced to less than 500, and that in\r\nEnglish and Irish waters the total is even less.\r\n\r\nIt has often been desired by naturalists that a check should be put\r\nby the Legislature upon the wanton destruction of the common seal, as\r\nwell as of the grey seal. It is certainly a regrettable result of the\r\nincreased visitation of our remote rocky shores by holiday-makers,\r\nso-called \"sportsmen\" and thoughtless ruffians of all kinds, that the\r\nlarge, and perfectly harmless, grey seal is likely to be exterminated.\r\nIn former times in these islands, as to-day in more northern regions,\r\nthere was a regular \"seal fishery,\" and vast numbers of seals were\r\nannually slaughtered for the sake of their skins and fat. The fur\r\nof both our native species, though differing vastly from the soft\r\nunder-fur of the fur-seals, or Otariæ, of the North Pacific--which\r\nbelong to a different section of the seal group, having small\r\nexternal \"ears,\" and hind feet which can be moved forward and used in\r\nwalking--is yet largely used for making gloves and thick overcoats.\r\nTo-day the number of British seals killed and brought to market is so\r\nsmall that no local fishery interests would suffer were all protected\r\nby the law during the spring and summer, when breeding and the rearing\r\nof the young is in progress. There is even less reason for objecting to\r\nthe protection of the larger and rarer \"Great Grey Seal,\" which, unless\r\nit had been placed under the shelter of an Act of Parliament, would in\r\nfive or six years have ceased to be a denizen of the British Islands.\r\n\r\nOwing to my having accidentally made the acquaintance of a young grey\r\nseal, as mentioned above, in North Cornwall, I feel a special interest\r\nin the legislative protection of this kind. I was at Boscastle at the\r\nend of August, and was delighted to see there on the morning after\r\nmy arrival three or four of the common seal swimming in the little\r\nrock-bound harbour. I was told by native authorities that there was\r\na cave in the rocks at the side of Pentargon Cove, a couple of miles\r\ndistant (formerly inaccessible from the cliffs), where these seals\r\nbreed, and that it had been the custom of some of the young men of\r\nthe district to go round there in a boat when wind and tide served in\r\nthe early spring and \"raid\" the cave. They could get in at low tide,\r\nand, armed with heavy cudgels, they would attack the seals which were\r\ncongregated in the cavern to the number of thirty or forty. A single\r\nwell-delivered blow on the nose was sufficient, I was assured, to\r\nkill a full-grown seal, and if fortunate the raiders might secure\r\nten or a dozen seals, which were then sold for their skins and oil\r\nto Bristol dealers. The enterprise was dangerous on account of the\r\nrising tide and the struggles of the seals and their assailants among\r\nthe slippery rocks and deep pools in the darkness of the cave. Cruel\r\nand savage as the adventure was, it yet had its justification on a\r\ncommercial basis--similar to that claimed for other \"fisheries\" of the\r\ngreat beasts of the sea hunted by man for their oil and skins. The\r\nseals of this cave were undoubtedly the small common seal--the Phoca\r\nvitulina--and I gathered that little had been heard of late years of\r\nsuccessful expeditions to these rocks. I was, however, told that a path\r\nhad been cut and ropes fastened to iron stanchions in the face of the\r\nrocky cliffs of Pentargon Cove just before my visit to Boscastle, which\r\nrendered it now comparatively easy to descend the 150 feet of rock from\r\nthe hill overlooking it and reach the shore of the curiously isolated\r\nand enclosed cove.\r\n\r\nSo, with two companions--my sisters--I set off the next morning for\r\nPentargon Cove. We climbed down the face of the cliff by the aid of\r\nthe much-needed ropes and found ourselves on the shore, the tide being\r\nlow. We hoped that we should be able to get a view of the \"seal-cave\"\r\nand some of its inhabitants swimming in its neighbourhood. We were\r\ndisappointed in this, and my companions hastened down to the water's\r\nedge, in order to get as near as possible to the rocky sides of the\r\ncove. I was about to follow them when I saw, lying in the open, on\r\nthe pebbles above high-tide mark, what I took at first for a white\r\nfur cloak left there by some previous visitor. I walked up to it,\r\nwhen, to my extreme astonishment, it turned round and displayed to my\r\nincredulous gaze a pair of very large black eyes and a threatening\r\narray of teeth, from which a defiant hiss was aimed at me. It was\r\na baby seal, covered all over with a splendid growth of white fur,\r\nthree inches deep. He was twice as big as the fur-covered young of\r\nthe common seal--more than two feet long--his black eyes were as big\r\nas pennies, and he was lying there on the upper beach, far from the\r\nwater, in the full blaze of the sun, as dry and as \"fluffy\" as a\r\nwell-dressed robe of Polar bear's skin. We were indeed well rewarded\r\nfor our excursion in search of the seal's cave of Pentargon Cove! For\r\nthis was a new-born pup of the Great Grey Seal, entirely unconnected\r\nwith the inferior population of the inaccessible cave, laid here in the\r\nopen by his mother at birth (as is the habit of her species), little\r\nsuspecting that the long-secluded shore of Pentargon Cove had that year\r\nbeen rendered accessible to marauding land-beasts for the first time.\r\nNot knowing the peculiarities of the grey seal and the refusal of its\r\nyoung to enter the water until six weeks after birth, when it sheds its\r\ncoat of long white hair, we cautiously rolled the little seal on to my\r\noutspread coat and carried him to the water's edge. After the hissing\r\nwith which he had greeted my first approach he was not unfriendly or\r\nalarmed, and for my part I must say that I have never yet stumbled upon\r\nany free gift of Nature which excited my admiration and regard in an\r\nequal degree. His eyes were beautiful beyond compare. We placed him\r\nclose to the water and expected him to wriggle into it and swim off,\r\nbut, on the contrary, he wriggled in the opposite direction, and slowly\r\nmade his way, by successive heaves, up the beach. He was not more than\r\na day or two old, as was shown by the unshrunken condition of the\r\numbilical cord. We did not like to leave him exposed to the attacks of\r\nvagrant boys, who might climb down into the cove, so we carried him on\r\nmy coat to the shelter of some large rocks, a hundred yards along the\r\nshore. There, with much regret, we left him.\r\n\r\nBut on the following evening, as we sat down to dinner, I heard from\r\nsome other visitors at the Wellington Inn, to whom, under pledge of\r\nsecrecy, I had confided our discovery, that they had been to Pentargon\r\nCove to visit our young friend, and found that he had been removed\r\n(probably by his mother) back to the exact spot where we had found\r\nhim. They also stated that his presence there had become known in the\r\nvillage, and that the conviction had been expressed that \"the boys\"\r\nwould certainly go and stone him to death! I had already reproached\r\nmyself for going elsewhere that day instead of to Pentargon Cove to\r\nlook after my young seal, and now I hastily left my dinner, procured in\r\nthe village two men and a potato sack, and hurried to Pentargon Cove.\r\nAs we approached the edge of the cliff the sun was setting, and the\r\ncove was very still and suffused with a red glow. Then a weird sound\r\nrent the air, like that made by one in the agonies of sea-sickness.\r\nIt was the little seal calling for his mother! It is the habit of the\r\nfemales of this species to leave the shore during the day when they go\r\nin search of the fish on which they feed, and to return to their young\r\nin the evening, in order to suckle them. I could see, from above, my\r\nbaby friend--a little white figure all alone in the deepening gloom\r\nof the great cliffs--raising his head and, by his cries, helplessly\r\ninviting his enemies to come and destroy him. In a few minutes we were\r\ndown by his side, had placed him in the potato sack, and brought him to\r\nthe upper air. On the way to the inn I purchased a large-sized baby's\r\nbottle with a fine indiarubber teat. We placed the little seal on straw\r\nin a large open packing-case in the stables, whilst the kitchen-maid\r\nwarmed some milk and filled the feeding-bottle. Then I brought it to\r\nhim, looking down on his broad, white-furred head, with its wonderful\r\neyes, set so as to throw their appealing gaze upwards. I touched his\r\nnose with the milky indiarubber teat. With unerring precision his lips\r\nclosed on it, his nostrils opened and shut in quick succession, and he\r\nhad emptied the bottle. I gave him a quart of milk before leaving him\r\nand getting my own belated meal. He slept comfortably, but at four in\r\nthe morning his cries rent the air, and threatened to wake every one\r\nin the hotel. I had to get up, descend to the kitchen, warm some more\r\nmilk for him, and satisfy his hunger. He became fond of the bottle,\r\nand also of the friend who held it for him. I arranged to take him to\r\nthe Zoological Gardens when, after three days, I left Boscastle. He\r\ntravelled to London in the guard's van in a specially constructed cage,\r\nand was as beautiful and happy as ever when I handed him over to the\r\nsuperintendent at Regent's Park.\r\n\r\nIn those days (as it happened) there was little understanding or care\r\nat \"the Gardens\" as to the feeding of an exceptional young animal\r\nlike my little seal. It is possible to treat cow's milk so as to\r\nrender it suitable to a young carnivore, much as it is \"humanized\" for\r\nthe feeding of human babies, and I was willing to pay for a canine\r\nfoster-mother were such procurable. I had then to leave London in\r\norder to preside over one of the sections of the British Association's\r\nmeeting at Southport, and intended to take complete charge of my baby\r\nseal upon my return. But in less than a week the neglectful guardians\r\nat Regent's Park had killed him with stale cow's milk. I believe such\r\na foundling would have a better chance there to-day, but the rearing\r\nof young mammals away from their mother is, of course, a difficult and\r\nuncertain job.\r\n\r\nI do not regret having taken the baby seal from Pentargon Cove, for I\r\nundoubtedly saved him from a violent death, whilst his mother would\r\nsoon recover from the loss due to my action--a loss to which she and\r\nher fellow \"grey seal-mothers\" must be not unfrequently exposed from\r\nother causes. I do regret, however, that it did not occur to me until\r\ntoo late that it would have been a wonderful experience to lie quietly\r\non the shore some few yards from the baby seal, as the sun set, and\r\nthen to see and hear the great seal-mother--7 or 8 feet long--swim\r\ninto the cove, raise her gigantic bulk on the shore, and heave herself\r\nacross the pebbles to her eager child. To witness the embraces,\r\ncaresses, and endearments of the great mysterious beast would have been\r\na revelation such as a naturalist values beyond measure. And so I hope,\r\nwith all my heart, that Mr. Lyell will succeed in his good work of\r\nprotecting the Great Grey Seal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE GROUSE AND OTHER BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIN August when so many people are either shooting or eating that\r\ndelectable bird--the grouse--a few words about him and his kind will\r\nbe seasonable. \"Grouse\" is an English word (said to have meant in its\r\noriginal form \"speckled\"), and by \"the\" grouse we mean the British\r\nred grouse, which, though closely related to the willow grouse,\r\ncalled \"rype\" (pronounced \"reepa\") in Norway--a name applied also to\r\nthe ptarmigan--is one of the very few species of birds peculiar to\r\nthe British Islands. The willow-grouse turns white in winter, and is\r\noften called the ptarmigan, which it is not, though closely related to\r\nit. The willow-grouse inhabits a sub-arctic zone, which extends from\r\nNorway across the whole continent of Europe and Asia, and through North\r\nAmerica, from the Aleutian Islands to Newfoundland. The red grouse\r\ndoes not naturally occur beyond the limits of the British Islands.\r\nIt does not turn white in winter, and the back of the cock bird is\r\ndarker in colour, as is also the whole plumage of the hen bird, than\r\nin the willow-grouse. The red grouse lives on heather-grown moors;\r\nthe willow-grouse prefers the shrubby growths of berry-bearing plants\r\ninterspersed with willows, whence its name. No distinction can be\r\ndiscovered in the voice, eggs, build, and anatomical details of the two\r\nspecies. The red grouse and the willow-grouse were, at no very distant\r\nprehistoric period, one species, but the race which has become isolated\r\nin these islands has just the small number of marked differences which\r\nI have mentioned, and it breeds true, and therefore we call it a\r\ndistinct \"species.\" In Scotland, the red grouse is called \"muir-fowl,\"\r\nand a century ago was almost invariably spoken of in England as\r\nmoor-fowl, or moor-game. It is found on moors from Monmouthshire\r\nnorthward to the Orkneys, and inhabits similar situations in Wales and\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe red grouse and the willow-grouse belong to a section or \"order\" of\r\nbirds which are classified together because they all have many points\r\nin common with \"the common fowl\" or jungle-cock and the pheasants.\r\nThat order or pedigree-branch was named by Huxley Alectoromorphæ,\r\nor cock-like birds, perhaps more simply termed Galliformes, Gallus\r\nbeing the Latin name for \"chanticleer.\" When there is a question of\r\nthe groups recognized in the classification of animals, it is well to\r\nbear in mind, once for all, that the biggest branches of the animal\r\npedigree are called \"phyla\" (or sub-kingdoms); that these have branches\r\nor sub-divisions which are called \"classes\" (birds are a class of the\r\nphylum Vertebrata). Classes divide into \"orders\"; these often are\r\nsubdivided into \"sub-orders.\" Orders comprise each several smaller\r\nbranches called \"families,\" families branch into \"genera,\" and each\r\n\"genus\" contains a number of \"species\" which have diverged from a\r\ncommon ancestral form, and become more or less stable and unchanging\r\n(but not unchangeable) at the present day. The individuals of a species\r\nare distinguishable by certain marks, shape, and colour from the\r\nindividuals of other species of the genus. They breed true to those\r\npoints when in natural conditions, and show some differences of habit,\r\nlocality, and constitution which emphasize their distinction as a\r\nseparate \"species.\"\r\n\r\nThe order Galliformes of the class Aves or birds is one of some\r\neighteen similar orders of birds. It contains several families, namely,\r\nthe grouse-birds, the partridges, the francolins (formerly introduced\r\ninto Italy from Cyprus), the quails, the pheasants, including the\r\ncommon fowl or Gallus, the peacocks, the turkeys, and, lastly, the\r\nguinea-fowls. The mound-builders and the South American curassows (very\r\nhandsome birds to be seen at the Zoological Gardens) are families which\r\nhave to be separated from the rest as a distinct sub-order. Fifty years\r\nago the pigeons were placed in one order with the galliform birds,\r\nwhich was termed \"Rasores,\" or scratching birds; but they are now\r\nseparated under the name Columbiformes.\r\n\r\nAll the galliform birds are specially agreeable to man as food, and\r\nthe domesticated race of the jungle-fowl--for which we have no proper\r\nEnglish name, except that of \"the\" fowl[1]--is second only to the dog\r\nin its close association with man. It seems to have been domesticated\r\nfirst in Burma, and was introduced into China about 1000 B.C., and\r\nthrough Greece into Europe about 600 B.C. It is not mentioned in the\r\nHebrew Scriptures, nor by Homer, nor figured on ancient Egyptian\r\nmonuments. It was called \"the Persian bird\" by the Greeks, indicating\r\nthat it came to them from the Far East through Persia. The common or\r\nbarn-door fowl is assigned to the genus Gallus, of which there are\r\nfour wild species. It is very closely related to the pheasants (genus\r\nPhasianus, with several \"local\" species); indeed, so closely that,\r\nwhen pheasants and \"fowls\" are kept together in confinement they\r\nwill sometimes interbreed and produce vigorous hybrids. The peacocks\r\nare Indian, and with them is associated the Malay Argus-pheasant.\r\nThey share with the turkeys, which are North American in origin, the\r\nhabit of \"display\" by the male birds when \"courting\"--a habit which\r\nwe see in a less marked form in the strutting, wing-scraping, and\r\ncries of the pheasants, chanticleers, and grouse-birds. The various\r\nspecies of partridges are confined to the temperate regions of the\r\nOld World, but the word is wrongly applied in America and Australia\r\nto other kinds of birds. The guinea-fowls are African, and so are the\r\nfrancolins and quails, the latter migrating to the South of Europe. It\r\nis an interesting fact that, when the turkey was first brought from\r\nAmerica, about 1550, a confusion grew up in Europe between it and\r\nthe guinea-fowl. The turkey was given a genus (Meleagris) to itself\r\nby Linnæus, who called it \"M. gallopavo,\" whilst the guinea-fowl was\r\ncalled \"Numida meleagris.\" We know, at present, other \"species\" of\r\nMeleagris besides M. gallopavo, and other species of Numida.\r\n\r\n[1] \"Chanticleer\" is the name given to the cock-bird of this species in\r\nthe very ancient story of \"Renard the Fox.\"\r\n\r\nNow we revert to the grouse-birds, a family for which the zoologist's\r\nname is Tetraonidæ. They all have the beautiful crimson arch of\r\nbare knobby skin above each eye which gives its chief beauty to our\r\ngrouse. The family contains several genera and included species. The\r\nlargest species is the capercailzie (a Gaelic word), or cock of the\r\nwood, called by the French \"coque du bois,\" by the Germans \"auerhahn\"\r\n(auerhuhn for the hen bird), and by the Norwegians \"tiur.\" It is\r\nplaced in the genus Tetrao (which gives its name to the \"family\"), and\r\nreceives the specific name \"urogallus.\" This fine bird was formerly\r\nnative in England, as well as in Scotland and Ireland, and is found\r\nin the pine forests of Europe from Spain to Lapland and Greece. It\r\nhas been re-established in Scotland since 1838. An allied species is\r\nfound in Siberia. The black grouse (often called black cock and grey\r\nhen) is a second species of the genus Tetrao, namely, T. tectrix. It\r\nis often called \"Lyrurus tetrix.\" The French name for it is \"coq de\r\nbruyère\"; the German is \"birkhahn.\" It is a smaller bird than the\r\ncapercailzie, but frequently produces hybrids with that species. The\r\nbeautifully curled tail-feathers are favourite adornments for the hat\r\nof mountaineers and hunters in the Tyrol and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThough the word \"grouse\" may have been first applied (as some think)\r\nto the black cock, it is now the proper appellation of the red grouse.\r\nThis bird is placed by zoologists in the genus Lagopus--the members\r\nof which are easily distinguishable from other Tetraonidæ by the fact\r\nthat their feet and toes are well covered with feathers. \"L. scoticus\"\r\nis the scientific name of the red grouse. Being a purely British bird,\r\nit has no foreign designations. \"L. saliceti\" is the name of the\r\nallied willow-grouse, which has an endless variety of names, owing to\r\nits great range of distribution. The willow-grouse is often called\r\nptarmigan, and is sold as such to the number of thousands by poulterers\r\nin our markets, but it is not the true ptarmigan. Owing to the fact\r\nthat its plumage is quite white in winter, there is much excuse for the\r\nconfusion. The name \"ptarmigan\" is the Gaelic word \"tarmachan,\" and\r\nno one has explained how the initial \"p\" came to be added to it. The\r\nbird called in Scotland tarmachan or ptarmigan is a third species of\r\nLagopus. It is much rarer in Scotland than the red grouse, and lives in\r\nhigh, bare ground. It is numerous at an elevation far above the growth\r\nof trees in Norway, and occurs also in the Pyrenees and the Alps. It\r\nturns white in winter (as do all the species of Lagopus except the red\r\ngrouse), and differs in many features of structure from the red grouse\r\nand the willow-grouse. It is called \"L. mutus.\" A fourth species of\r\nLagopus is L. rupestris, of North America, Greenland, Iceland, and\r\nSiberia. Spitzbergen has a fifth species, L. hemileucurus, a large\r\nform. The sixth and smallest species of Lagopus is the L. leucurus of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. There are yet further some excellent grouse-like\r\nbirds, which are separated to form other genera distinct from Lagopus.\r\nThough they do not inhabit the British Islands, some of them are\r\nbrought occasionally to the London market. The hazel-hen of continental\r\nEurope is one of these, and is considered to be the most delicate\r\ngame-bird that comes to table. It is placed in the genus Bonasa, and\r\nreceives the specific name \"sylvestris.\" The French call it \"gelinotte\"\r\n(under which name various kinds of cold-storage grouse are often\r\nserved in London clubs and restaurants), the Germans \"hasel-huhn,\"\r\nand the Scandinavians \"hjerpe.\" It is a purely forest bird. It is\r\nrepresented in North America by four other species, of which the best\r\nknown is Bonasa umbellus, called by the Americans the ruffed grouse or\r\nbirch-partridge.\r\n\r\nAnother genus of Tetraonidæ, or grouse-birds, is called \"Canachites,\"\r\nand contains the species known as the Canadian spruce-partridge,\r\nFranklin's spruce-partridge, and the Siberian spruce-partridge. Nearly\r\nallied to these is a genus Dendragapus, with three North American\r\nspecies. Then we have the sage-cock of the plains of California\r\n(Centrocerus urophasianus), three species of sharp-tailed grouse (genus\r\nPediocætes), and \"the prairie hen,\" of which three species are placed\r\nin the genus Tympanuchus. The United States have, undoubtedly, a great\r\nvariety of grouse-like birds. Nevertheless, a year ago I met in Paris\r\nan American from the neighbourhood of Boston who told me that he should\r\nhave to desert his native land and come to live in Europe, because he\r\ncould not obtain a regular supply of game-birds for his table in the\r\neastern States. He was eating a Scotch grouse at the time with evident\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe supply of grouse in this country has been threatened by disease\r\ncaused by the attempt to make the moors carry more birds than they\r\nwould do under natural conditions. The number annually shot on British\r\nmoors is enormous. Predaceous animals have been destroyed in order\r\nto increase the number of birds, but this proceeding has resulted in\r\nallowing the weakly to survive. The undisturbed stretches of moorland\r\nhave also of late years been greatly broken into both by roads and\r\nbuilding, and by the too abundant visitation of strangers of all kinds.\r\nOnly a few years ago one moor-owner was able to boast that he had on\r\nseveral occasions killed over 500 head of grouse in a single day on\r\nhis moor, and that in one season he and his guests had killed 18,231\r\nhead of grouse on that same moor! Personally I rejoice when grouse are\r\nabundant, but it seems to me possible that the moor above mentioned had\r\nbeen made to carry, so to speak, too heavy a crop. However, there is\r\nreason to hope that the balance of Nature is restored after a few years\r\nof disease, which kills off the too-abundant bird population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE SAND AND PEBBLES OF THE SEASHORE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"beach\" on our English coast is an accumulation of pebbles or of\r\nsand, or of both, often accompanied by dead shells and other fragments\r\nthrown up by the sea. Very generally it slopes rapidly from above\r\nhigh-water mark to about half-tide limit, and then merges into a more\r\nhorizontal expanse of fine, compact sand. This last is not \"a beach\"\r\nthrown up by waves, but a sediment or deposit. It forms a flat, often\r\nripple-marked plain (much has been written as to how those ripple-marks\r\nare produced), which is exposed at low water, the sea retreating for\r\na quarter or even half a mile or more over it, on some level shores.\r\nSometimes, though rarely, the sea rises and falls against a hard, rocky\r\ncliff without forming any beach or exposing any \"shore\" even at low\r\ntide. This occurs on parts of the Cornish coast, where the Atlantic\r\nbeats against adamantine cliffs, which even at low tide rise sheer from\r\nthe water. Again, it sometimes happens that the shore is simply formed\r\nof a terrace of sloping hard rock, without any \"beach.\" But on the\r\ncoast of England generally there is a good beach of sand or pebbles, or\r\nboth, overlying the native rock or clay, and sometimes it is growing\r\nevery year, so as to extend the land surface seawards and add new acres\r\nto the possessions of the landlord.\r\n\r\nOn other parts of the coast the beach \"travels,\" being driven along\r\nthe underlying solid shore by the prevailing direction of the tidal\r\ncurrents and by the waves. The sea-waves break close to the soft\r\ncliffs of clay, sand, and sandstone. These are continually crumbling\r\naway owing to the action of land water, which soaks from the surface\r\ndown to the layers of clay and forms subterranean springs and streams.\r\nThey undermine the face of the cliff and cause the upper parts to\r\ntopple. When there is a big, broad, growing beach in front of such\r\na cliff, the breaking down or \"toppling\" of its face only leads to\r\nthe formation of a slope (at the \"angle of rest\"), and things remain\r\nbut little changed for ages. But if the beach is not being piled up\r\nand added to and growing out seawards year by year, and is, on the\r\ncontrary, a travelling beach, then the sea comes close up to the cliff,\r\nand when masses of it topple on to the beach the sea washes them away,\r\nand no \"slope of repose\" is formed. The cliff keeps on toppling as it\r\nis undermined by springs of land water. Its natural buttress against\r\nfurther breakage--namely, its own fallen material--instead of resting\r\nagainst it as a great sloping, protective bank, is washed away by the\r\nsea as fast as it falls, and is carried down the coast by the tidal\r\ncurrents. This is the story of \"coast erosion\" about which there has\r\nrecently been a Government inquiry. Where the combined action of\r\nprevailing winds and sea currents is throwing up and adding to the\r\nbeach there is no coast erosion. The causes of the sea currents on\r\nour coasts are not easy to determine, as they are connected with the\r\ngeneral contour of the land and the currents in large tracts of sea,\r\nsuch as the Channel and the North Sea. Coast erosion is a serious\r\nthing. Large parts of the coast of Suffolk and Norfolk are being thus\r\nwashed away. It can be prevented by \"holding\" the beach with piles and\r\nboarding, but this costs too much to make it worth doing unless the\r\nland so preserved has a special value for the erection of houses.\r\n\r\nAt Felixstowe, where I am writing, the sea has swept away most of the\r\nflat--the \"dunes,\" or \"deans\"--covered with grass, which it had itself\r\nbuilt up by a contrary accumulating action before the time of the\r\nRomans. On this flat the ancient Roman town was built. Why the sea has\r\nreversed its action is very difficult to say. But within my knowledge\r\nof this place high-water mark has advanced as much as 300 yards\r\nnearer than it was to the old roadway and to old houses. The great\r\ntown of Dunwich, which in the Middle Ages had eleven churches, strong\r\nfortifications, and a flourishing trade, stood on the flat grass-land\r\nin front of the cliff on the Suffolk coast. Its site is now under the\r\nsea, not far from here. The breaking away of the cliff (on to which\r\npart of the town extended) is still going on there. A few years ago I\r\nsaw a great bricked well lying like a fallen chimney on the shore. It\r\nhad been exposed by the crumbling of the cliff, and at last fell out\r\nof it. Once that well supplied fresh water to the monastery, part of\r\nthe walls of which are still standing, and were formerly three-quarters\r\nof a mile distant from the seashore. The prehistoric cliffs to which\r\nthe sea came before it formed the flats or links which it is now again\r\neating away, are often traceable a mile or two inland. On the other\r\nhand, on parts of the Lincolnshire coast the sea has piled up sand and\r\nshingle and added valuable land to the extent of hundreds of acres to\r\nthe property of those whose estates were bounded by the shore line,\r\nand is still doing so. Perhaps the action of the north wind in blowing\r\nback and piling up sand out of the reach of the tide is influential in\r\nproducing this increase of shore-lands, which face northwards. Blown\r\nsand forms hills 30 feet and more in height on such flat lands as those\r\nof the Sandwich and Deal \"links,\" which have been thrown up by the sea\r\nsince St. Augustine landed at Richborough, then a seaport, now a couple\r\nof miles from the sea. On the French coast near Boulogne the sand has\r\nbeen blown inland so as to form stratified deposits on the low hill\r\ncountry as far as 3 or 4 miles from the sea, and the neighbouring port\r\nof Ambleteuse, which five hundred years ago had the chief trade with\r\nEngland--is now nothing but a vast stratified \"dune\" of blown sand. The\r\ngreat Napoleon made some attempt to reopen the harbour, but gave it up\r\nas a bad job; the blowing of sand inwards from the enormous tract of\r\nflat, sandy shore was too much for his engineers.\r\n\r\nThe \"erosion\" and the contrary process of the \"extension\" of the\r\ncoast by the action of the waves and currents of the sea must be kept\r\napart and distinguished from a process leading to similar but not\r\nidentical results, namely, the actual \"crumpling\" or \"buckling\" of\r\nthe earth's crust, leading to the rising of the land surface in some\r\nparts of the globe relatively to the sea-level, and on the other hand\r\nto the sinking of the land beneath the sea in other regions. This\r\nchange of the actual level of the land has continually gone on in the\r\npast, and is continually going on to-day. What are called \"raised\r\nbeaches\" are seen on many parts of the coast. These are lines of\r\nancient beach, consisting of sea-worn pebbles, fragments of shell,\r\netc., forming terraces along the face of the rocks which rise from the\r\npresent seashore--terraces which are now 15, 30, or more feet above\r\nthe sea-level, although they must at no very distant period have been\r\nat the level of the sea. The land has risen and carried them up out\r\nof reach of the waves. Such a raised beach is seen along the rocks\r\nbordering Plymouth Sound, at a height of some 15 feet (so far as I can,\r\nat this moment, remember) above high-water mark. Owing to the fact\r\nthat the rock is limestone, and is dissolved and redeposited by rain\r\nwater, as a rock of sugar might be, the pebbles and shells of the old\r\nbeach are all stuck together or \"petrified\" by redeposited limestone\r\n(carbonate of lime). Lumps of it can be carried away as specimens.\r\n\r\nGeological deposits of much older date than these comparatively recent\r\nraised beaches tell us of the rising of great masses of land. Thus,\r\nfor instance, marine shells in a deposit not quite so old as our chalk\r\ncliffs and downs, are present at a height of 10,000 feet, forming part\r\nof the Alps. At one time that very spot was the bottom of the ocean,\r\nwhilst other tracts of the earth's surface, now sunk hundreds of\r\nfathoms below the sea-level, stood out as continents, with hills and\r\nvalleys well raised above the waters. Direct evidence of the recent\r\nsinking of the coast as distinct from its erosion is not familiar to\r\nus in England. The evidence of it is naturally obliterated, as the\r\nsinking goes on, whereas on a rising coast the evidence is as naturally\r\npreserved. But on the shores of the Mediterranean near Naples the\r\nevidence of sinking is well preserved, and has been carefully studied\r\nand recorded. The ancient Roman road is still sunk beneath the water,\r\nthough the celebrated temple of Puteoli, which was formerly submerged\r\nby the sinking of the land, has reappeared by a subsequent elevation of\r\nthe same area. This has not brought the site to so high a level as it\r\nhad when the temple was built, as appears from the fact that the Roman\r\npaved roadway close by is still some 15 feet below the surface of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nA beach is built up of water-worn pebbles, consisting usually of bits\r\nof the rock of the immediate vicinity, which have become rounded and\r\nshaped by continually rolling and knocking against one another as the\r\nwaves of the sea throw them up or drag them down the sloping heap of\r\nlike pebbles which is accumulated near high-water line. At Dover and\r\nsuch places, under chalk cliffs, the beach consists of chalk pebbles\r\noval in shape, often of 8 or 9 inches in length, with a large number\r\nof well-rounded flint pebbles as big as your fist interspersed, or\r\noutnumbering the chalk pebbles. At Tenby, in South Wales, the beach\r\nconsists of assorted sizes of limestone pebbles, well-worn bits of\r\nthe limestone cliffs of the neighbourhood. Large numbers of them are\r\nliterally \"worm-eaten,\" being bored into, hard and dense as they are,\r\nby a little marine worm (known as Polydora), which may be sometimes\r\nfound alive and at work in these limestone pebbles lying between tide\r\nlimits, or more easily at other places in similarly placed chalk blocks\r\nor pebbles. On a coast bounded by granite cliffs you get a beach of\r\ngranite pebbles; where there are cliffs of slate or of sandstone,\r\npebbles of slate or of sandstone.\r\n\r\nBut there are some beaches which, as remarked above, are continually\r\ntravelling along the coast. That on the English shores of the North\r\nSea, for instance, is always moving southwards, except where it is held\r\nby piles and breakwaters, locally called \"shies.\" Moreover, the land of\r\nthe East Coast, especially the Suffolk and Norfolk coast, in the course\r\nof its erosion, has given back to the sea old deposits of the glacial\r\nand post-glacial period, consisting of gravels and \"drift,\" made up of\r\nflint pebbles and fragments of rocks from the more northern regions\r\nover which the great European ice-cap of the glacial epoch extended,\r\nand from which it ground and tore the surface rock and carried large\r\nand small masses--boulders and incredible millions of tons of broken\r\nup fragments--and spread them over East Anglia (where they form the\r\nso-called \"glacial drift\"), and over regions still submerged in the\r\nNorth Sea. Consequently the beach on the Suffolk seashore has a\r\nspecially variegated assortment of pebbles from all sorts of more\r\nnortherly situated rocks--though small flint pebbles, derived directly\r\nfrom glacial drift and by the drift from the chalk land-surface (the\r\nchalk itself not now reaching the shore-line of East Anglia), are\r\ngreatly predominant. It is in the chalk that flint takes its origin,\r\nbeing found there as large irregular nodules and sheets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUENTS OF A SEABEACH\r\n\r\n\r\nI ONCE went down to Aldeburgh, on the Suffolk coast, with a party of\r\nfriends, which included an American writer, himself as delightful and\r\ncharming as his stories. Why should I not give his name? It was Cable,\r\nthe author of \"Old Creole Days.\" We walked through the little town\r\nto the sea-front, and came upon the immense beach spreading out for\r\nmiles towards Orford Ness. \"Well, I never!\" said he to me; \"I suppose\r\nthe hotel people have put those stones there to make a promenade for\r\nthe visitors. It's a big thing.\" It took me some time to persuade him\r\nthat they were brought there by the sea and spread out by it alone.\r\nIt was his first visit to Europe, but he had seen the seashore on the\r\nother side, and there was nothing like this over there, he declared. A\r\nsimilar readiness to ascribe Nature's handiwork to the enterprise of\r\nhotel-keepers led a visitor to the Bel Alp, in the Rhone Valley, when\r\nhe looked down from that high-placed hostelry on to the great Aletsch\r\nglacier, with its central \"moraine\" of huge rock masses and debris,\r\nto exclaim, \"I see the proprietor has spread a cinder-path along the\r\nglacier to prevent us from slipping. It's a convenience, no doubt, but\r\ngives a nasty dirty look to the snow.\" Mr. Cable, when he once realized\r\nthat the great Aldeburgh beach was a natural production, did what a\r\ntrue poet and naturalist must do--he fell in love with it, and spent\r\nhours in filling his pockets with strange-looking pebbles of all kinds\r\nuntil he was brought into the house to dinner by main force, when he\r\nspread his collection on the table, and demanded an explanation of\r\n\"what, whence, and why\" in regard to each pebble. Our companions--a\r\ngreat lawyer, a military hero, a politician, and two \"learned\r\nmen\"--regarded him as eccentric, not to say childish. But I entirely\r\nsympathized with him, and when next day we sailed down to Orford and\r\nstood in front of the old Norman fortress, he further established\r\nhimself in my regard by deeply sighing and exclaiming, \"So that is a\r\nreal English castle!\" whilst several large tears quietly streamed down\r\nhis undisturbed countenance.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of what various rocks from far-distant localities may\r\nbe brought together on an East Coast beach, take that of Felixstowe\r\nas an example. What is true of the East Coast is to some extent also\r\ntrue of the South Coast, and, indeed, wherever the sea makes the\r\npebbles of a modern beach from the materials furnished by the breaking\r\nup of old deposits, which were in their day brought by ice-flows or\r\ntorrential currents from remote regions. The most abundant kind of\r\npebbles on the Felixstowe beach are small, rounded, somewhat flat\r\npieces of flint, derived not directly from the chalk which is the\r\n\"stratum\" or \"bed\" in which flint is originally formed, but from\r\nthe Red Crag capping the clay cliffs (London clay or early Eocene),\r\nand also from surface washings and \"gravels\" (of later age than the\r\ncrag) farther north, whence they have travelled southward with many\r\nother constituents of the beach. All these flints are stained ruddy\r\nbrown or yellow by iron--a process they underwent when lying in the\r\ngravels or in the crag in which they were deposited as pebbles,\r\nbroken, washed, and rolled ages ago from the chalk. The iron is in\r\na high state of oxidation, and stains not only flint pebbles but\r\nthe sands of the Red Crag and later gravels a bright orange-red, or\r\nsometimes a less ruddy yellow. The iron comes originally from very\r\nancient igneous rocks in which it is black and usually combined with\r\nsilica. The chalk flints are always, owing, it seems, to minute\r\nquantities of carbon, quite black in the mass, but thin, translucent\r\nsplinters have a yellowish-brown tint. The flints are free from iron\r\nstain when taken direct from the chalk. The commonest pebble next to\r\nflint is milky quartz, or opaque white quartz. This is derived from\r\nsome far northern source, where there are igneous rocks traversed\r\nby veins of this substance (perhaps Norway). Quartz, like flint, is\r\npure silica, the oxide of the element silicon. It appears in another\r\nform as rock-crystal, and also as chalcedony and agate. Opal also\r\nis pure silica, but differs from quartz and its varieties in being\r\nnon-crystalline or amorphous, and in being less hard and of less\r\nspecific gravity than quartz. Opal is soluble in alkaline water\r\ncontaining free carbonic acid, such as are many natural waters and the\r\nsea! But quartz is not so. The siliceous \"spicules\" and skeletons of\r\nmany microscopic animals and plants are \"opal.\" The gem known as \"opal\"\r\nis a variety owing its beauty to minute fissures in its substance which\r\nbreak up light into the prismatic colours.\r\n\r\nA great deal rarer than the milky quartz, but well known on the East\r\nCoast on account of their beauty, and often sought for to be cut\r\nand polished, are the small rolled bits or pebbles of chalcedony or\r\nagate, which have been bedded before their appearance on the beach\r\nin some of the pre-glacial or post-glacial gravels, together with\r\nthe flints, and in consequence are often stained of a fine red. Such\r\nclear red-stained chalcedony is called \"carnelian\"; if the banded\r\nagate structure shows, it is called agate rather than carnelian. It is\r\nwonderful how many beautiful pieces of both carnelian and agate are\r\npicked up on the Felixstowe beach, rarely, however, bigger than a hazel\r\nnut. The original source of these carnelians and agates is the East of\r\nScotland. At Montrose you may see the igneous rock containing pale,\r\nlavender-coloured agate nodules as big as a potato, the breaking and\r\nrolling of which by the sea into small bits has furnished our Suffolk\r\ncarnelians. Quartzite--more or less translucent, sandy-looking pebbles,\r\ncolourless or yellow: jasper, black or green with red veining: a fine\r\nwine-red or purple stone often veined with quartz--are all more or\r\nless common, and come from northern igneous rocks--possibly some from\r\nScandinavia and some from the breaking up of an ancient \"breccia\" of\r\nthe Triassic age, which still exists northwards of East Anglia.\r\n\r\nOther pebbles very common on this shore are those formed in a curious\r\nway by the sea-water from the clay cliffs and sea bottom which are here\r\npresent, and are of that special geologic age and character known as\r\nthe London clay. The sea at this moment is continually converting the\r\nclay of our Suffolk shore into \"cement-stone\" by a definite chemical\r\nprocess. The clay and many other things submerged in the sea, as\r\nShakespeare knew, \"undergo a sea-change.\" The cement-stone used to be\r\ndredged up from the sea bottom and ground to make cement at Harwich.\r\nGreat rock-like slabs of it pave the shore at low water, and pebbles\r\nof it are abundant. The curious thing is that ages ago--geological\r\nages, I mean--when the sea was throwing up here the old shell-banks\r\nand sand-banks known nowadays as \"the Red and Coralline Crags,\" the\r\nLondon clay cliffs and clay sea bottom were in existence just as they\r\nare now. But in that period there existed here enormous quantities\r\nof bones of whales of kinds now extinct, which had lived a little\r\nearlier in the sea of this area, and were deposited in vast quantity\r\nas a sort of first layer of beach or shallow water sea-drift. Bones\r\nconsist largely of phosphate of lime, and are used as manure. In that\r\nold crag sea the phosphate of lime was dissolved from the deposit of\r\nbones, and as we find occurring in the case of other clays and other\r\nbones elsewhere--was chemically taken up by the clay--the same kind of\r\nclay which to-day is being converted into \"cement-stone.\" It was thus,\r\nat that remote period, converted into \"clay phosphorite,\" owing to the\r\npresence of the immense deposit of whales' bones, and it has been known\r\nfor sixty years as Suffolk \"coprolite,\" owing to a mistaken notion\r\nthat it was the petrified dung of extinct animals. It has been dug up\r\nby the ton from below the crag all over this part of Suffolk, where it\r\nforms, together with bones, teeth, flints, and box-stones, a bed of\r\nsmall nodules, a foot or so thick separating the London clay from the\r\nshelly \"crag.\" This bed is called the Suffolk bone-bed or nodule-bed.\r\nThe phosphorite, or \"coprolite,\" occurs in the form of bits of clay,\r\nhardened by phosphate of lime, and of the colour of chocolate, and\r\nhundreds of tons of it have been used by manufacturers of the manure\r\nknown as \"superphosphate.\" Henslow, of Cambridge, Darwin's friend and\r\nteacher, was the first to point out its value. Bits of it, as well\r\nas box-stones, and fragments of bone, teeth of whales, of sharks, of\r\nmastodon, rhinoceros, tapir, and other extinct animals--all fallen from\r\nthe bone-bed in the cliff--are found mixed with the pebbles of the\r\nSuffolk beach by those who lie on that beach in the sunshine, and, for\r\nwant of something better to do, turn over handful after handful of its\r\nvaried material. And, besides all the stones I have already mentioned,\r\nthey find amber, washed here by some mysterious currents from the\r\nBaltic, wonderful fossil shells out of the crag, the cameo shell, and\r\nthe great volute,--shells which are as friable as the best pastry\r\nwhen dug out of the Red Crag, but here on the shore become hardened\r\nby definite chemical action of the sea-water, so as to be as firm as\r\nsteel. Here, too, the \"chiffonier\" of the seashore finds recent shells,\r\nrecent bones (slowly dissolving and wearing away), well-rounded bits\r\nof glass, jet drifted down from Whitby, Roman coins, bits of Samian\r\nware (!), mediaeval keys, bits of coal, burnt flints (from steamers'\r\nfurnaces), and box-stones.\r\n\r\nA very important and interesting thing about \"beaches\" is the way in\r\nwhich the pebbles of which they consist are assorted in sizes. Suppose\r\nthat one prepares a trough some two or three yards long and twelve\r\ninches deep, and lets it fill with water from a constantly running tap,\r\ntilting it slightly so that the water will overflow and run away at the\r\nend farthest from the tap. Then if one drops into the trough near the\r\ntap handful after handful of coarse sand and small stones of varied\r\nsizes, they will be carried along by the stream, and the more rapid and\r\nvoluminous the stream the farther they will be carried. But they will\r\neventually sink to the bottom of the trough, the bigger pieces first,\r\nthen the medium-sized, then the small, and the smaller in order, as the\r\ncurrent carries them along, so that one gets a separation and sorting\r\nof the solid particles according to size, a very fine sediment being\r\ndeposited last of all at the far end of the trough. The waves of the\r\nsea are continually stirring up and assorting the constituents of the\r\nbeach in this way. Usually the largest pebbles are thrown up farthest\r\nby the advancing waves, and dropped soonest by the backward suck of\r\nthe retreating water, so that one generally finds a predominance of\r\nbig pebbles at the top of the beach. But on the flat shore of firm\r\nripple-marked sand lying lower down than the sloping \"beach\" and only\r\nexposed at quite \"low tide,\" one often finds very big pebbles of eight\r\nor nine pounds weight scattered here and there and little rubbed or\r\nrounded. They have gradually moved down the sloping beach and are too\r\nheavy to be thrown back again by the waves of the shallow sea which\r\nflows over the flat shores characteristic of much of our south-eastern\r\nand southern coast. On some parts of the coast huge banks, consisting\r\nexclusively of enormous pebbles as big as a quartern loaf, are piled\r\nup by the waves, forming a great ridge often miles in length, as at\r\nthe celebrated Chesil pebble bank near Weymouth, and at Westward Ho!\r\nin North Devon. The presence of these specially large pebbles is due\r\nto the special character of the rocks which are broken up by the sea\r\nto form them, and to the specially powerful wave-compelling winds and\r\ntidal currents at the parts of the coast where they are produced.\r\n\r\nOne generally finds a selected accumulation of moderate-sized pebbles\r\nlower down the beach as the tide recedes, and then still lower down\r\npatches of sand alternating with patches or tracts of quite small\r\npebbles not much bigger than a dried pea. They are always assorted in\r\nsizes, but the extent of each tract of a given size of pebble varies\r\ngreatly on different beaches along the coast, and even from day to day\r\non the same shore. The greater or less violence of the waves, and of\r\nthe currents caused by wind and tide, is the cause of this variation\r\nand local difference. The pebbles of the \"beach\" are, of course, always\r\nbeing worn away, rounded and rubbed down by their daily movement upon\r\none another, caused by the waves as the tide mounts and again descends\r\nover the shore. Even the biggest stones, excepting those which lie\r\nin deeper water beyond the beach, are eventually rubbed down, and\r\nbecome quite small; but a point is reached when, the weight of the\r\npebbles being very small, they have but little effect in rubbing down\r\neach other, and consequently where the pebbles consist of very hard\r\nmaterial--like flints--the smallest ones are not so much rounded, but\r\nare angular and irregular in shape.\r\n\r\nWhilst a perfect gradation in size can be found from the largest flint\r\npebbles some 6 inches or 7 inches long to the smallest, usually not\r\nbigger than a split pea (though sometimes a patch of even smaller\r\nconstituents may be found), there is a real break or gap between\r\n\"pebbles\" and \"sand.\" I am referring now to what is commonly known as\r\n\"sand\" on the southern part of the East Coast, much of the South Coast,\r\nand the shores of Holland, Belgium, and France. There are \"sands\" of\r\nsofter material (limestone and coral sand), but the sands in question\r\nare almost entirely siliceous, made up of tiny fragments of flint, of\r\nquartz, agate, and hard, igneous rock. They are often called \"sharp\"\r\nsand. The particles forming this sand are sorted out by the action of\r\nmoving water, and form large tracts between tide-marks looking like\r\nbrown sugar, for which baby visitors have been known to mistake them,\r\nand accordingly to swallow small handfuls. The strong wind from the\r\nsea blows the sand thus exposed, as it dries, inland out of reach of\r\nthe tide, to form sand-dunes, and it is also deposited, together with\r\nstill finer particles (those called \"mud\"), on the shallower parts\r\nof the sea bottom. The curious thing about the particles of \"sharp\"\r\nsand is that they are angular, and for the most part without rounded\r\nedges. If you examine them under a microscope you will see that they\r\ndo not look like pebbles--in fact, they are not pebbles, for they are\r\nso small and have so little weight, or, rather, mass, that they do not\r\nrub each other to any effect when moved about in water. They look like,\r\nand, in fact, are, for the most part broken bits of silica, unworn\r\nand sharp-edged splinters and chips, glass-like in their transparency\r\nand most of them colourless, a few only iron-stained and yellow.\r\nAmongst these are a few rounded, almost spherical pieces, which are no\r\ndoubt of the nature of minute water-worn pebbles. Although these few\r\nminute pebbles exist among the sharp, chiplike particles of \"sand,\"\r\nit is clear that we must broadly distinguish \"pebbles\" of all sizes\r\ndown to the smallest--from the much smaller \"sand particles.\" There\r\nis no intermediate quality of material between \"sand\" and the finest\r\n\"shingle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nQUICKSANDS AND FIRE-STONES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are curious facts about sand which can be studied on the\r\nseashore. There are the \"quicksands,\" mixtures of sand and water, which\r\nsometimes engulf pedestrians and horsemen at low tide, not only at\r\nthe Mont St. Michel, on the Normandy coast, but at many spots on the\r\nEnglish, Welsh, and Scotch coasts. Small and harmless quicksands are\r\noften formed where the sand is not firmly \"bedded\" by the receding sea,\r\nand the sea-water does not drain off, but forms a sort of sand-bog.\r\nThen one may also study the polishing and eroding effect of dry blown\r\nsand, which gives a \"sand-glaze\" to flints, and in \"sand-deserts\" often\r\nwears away great rocks. The natural polishing of flints and other\r\nhard bodies by fine sand carried over them for months and years in\r\nsuccession by a stream of water, is also a matter of great interest,\r\nabout which archæologists want further information.\r\n\r\nA very interesting fact about the ordinary sand of the seashore is\r\nthat two pints of dry sand and half a pint of water when mixed do not\r\nmake two pints and a half, but less than that quantity. If you fill a\r\nchild's pail with dry sand from above the tide-mark, and then pour on\r\nto it some water, the mass of sand actually shrinks. The reason is that\r\nwhen the sand is dry there is air between its particles, but when the\r\nsand-particles are wetted they adhere closely to each other; the air is\r\ndriven out, and the water does not exactly take an equivalent space,\r\nbut occupies less room than the air did, owing to the close clinging\r\ntogether of the wet particles. If you add a little water to some dry\r\nsand under the microscope, you will see the sand-particles move and\r\ncling closely to one another. \"Capillary attraction\"--the ascent of\r\nliquid in very fine tubes or spaces--is a result of the same sort of\r\nadhesive action. If you walk on the firm, damp sand exposed at low tide\r\non many parts of the seashore when it is just free from water on the\r\nsurface, you will see that when you put your foot down the sand becomes\r\nsuddenly pale for some seven inches or so all round your foot. The\r\nreason is that the water has left the pale-looking sand (dry sand looks\r\npaler than wet sand), and has gone into the sand under your foot, which\r\nis being squeezed by your weight. The water passing into that squeezed\r\nsand enables its particles to sit tighter or closer together, and so\r\nto yield to the pressure caused by your weight. You actually squeeze\r\nwater \"into\" the sand, instead of squeezing water \"out\" of it, as is\r\nusually the case when you squeeze part of a wet substance--say a cloth\r\nor a sponge. When you lift your foot up, you find that your footmark is\r\ncovered with water--the water you had drawn to that particular spot by\r\nsqueezing it. It separates as soon as the pressure is removed.\r\n\r\nQuartz and quartzite pebbles occur on the South as well as the East\r\nCoast. They are sometimes called \"fire-stones,\" because they can\r\nbe made to produce flashes of flame. If you take a couple of these\r\npebbles, each about as big as the bowl of a dessert-spoon (a couple of\r\nflint pebbles will serve, but not so well), and holding one in each\r\nhand in a dark room, or at night, scrape one with the other very\r\nfirmly, you will produce a flash of light of an orange or reddish\r\ncolour. And at the same time you will notice a very peculiar smell,\r\nrather agreeable than otherwise, like that of burning vegetable matter.\r\nIt would seem that the rubbing together of the stones produces a fine\r\npowder of some of the siliceous substance of the stone and at the\r\nsame time a very high temperature, which sets the powder aflame. I\r\nhad the idea at one time, based on the curious smell given out by the\r\nflashing pebbles, that perhaps it was a thin coating of vegetable or\r\nother organic matter derived from the sea-water which burns when the\r\nstones are thus rubbed together; but I found on chemically cleaning\r\nmy pebbles, first with strong acid and then with alkali, that the\r\nflame and the smell were produced just as well by these chemically\r\nclean stones as by those taken from the beach. The flame produced\r\nby the rubbing of the two stones seemed then to be like the sparks\r\nobtained by strike-a-lights of flint and steel, or the prehistoric\r\nflint and pyrites. Now, however, a new fact demands consideration. The\r\nsupposition that the powdered silica formed, when one rubs the two\r\npebbles together, is actually \"burnt,\" that is to say, combined with\r\nthe oxygen of the air by the great heat of the friction, is rendered\r\nunlikely by the fact that if you perform the rubbing operation in a\r\nbasin of water with the stones submerged, the flash is produced as\r\neasily as in the air. My attention was drawn to this fact by a letter\r\nfrom the well-known naturalist the Rev. Reginald Gatty. I at once tried\r\nthe experiment and found the fact to be as my correspondent stated. Not\r\nonly so, but the smell was produced as well as the flash.\r\n\r\nWith the desire to get further light on the subject, I consulted\r\nthe great experimental physicist, my friend Sir James Dewar, in his\r\nlaboratory at the Royal Institution. He told me that the late Professor\r\nTyndal used to exhibit the production of flame by the friction of two\r\npieces of quartz in his lectures on heat, but made use of a very large\r\nand rough crystal of quartz (rock-crystal) and rubbed its rough surface\r\nwith another large crystal. Tyndal's note on the subject in his lecture\r\nprogramme was as follows (Juvenile Lectures on Heat, 1877-78): \"When\r\nvery hard substances are rubbed together light is produced as well as\r\nheat.\" Sir James Dewar kindly showed me the crystals used by Tyndal,\r\nthe larger was 16 inches long and 4 or 5 inches broad. We repeated the\r\nexperiment in the darkened lecture room, and obtained splendid flashes.\r\nThe same smell is produced when rock-crystal is used as when flint or\r\nquartz pebbles are rubbed together. All three are the same chemical\r\nbody, namely, silica (oxide of silicon). We also found that when the\r\ncrystals were bathed with water or (this is a new fact) with absolute\r\nalcohol, the same flashing was produced by the friction of one against\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nLater, with the kind assistance of Mr. Herbert Smith, of the mineral\r\ndepartment of the Natural History Museum, I examined, with a\r\nspectroscope, the flash given by two quartzite pebbles when rubbed\r\ntogether. No distinctive lines or bands were seen; only a \"continuous\"\r\nspectrum, showing that the temperature produced was not high enough to\r\nvolatilize the silicon. I also examined some pebbles of another very\r\nhard substance--nearly as hard as silica (rock-crystal, quartz, and\r\nflint). This was what is called \"corundum,\" the massive form of \"emery\r\npowder\" (oxide of aluminium). By grinding two of these corundum pebbles\r\nwith very great pressure one against the other (using much greater\r\npressure than is needful in the case of quartz), I obtained flashes\r\nof light. It was not known previously that any pebbles except those\r\nof silica would give flashes of light when rubbed together. A smell\r\nresembling that given out by rubbed quartz, but fainter, was observed.\r\n\r\nThose are the facts--new to me and to many others--about this curious\r\nsubject. The flashing under water is a very remarkable thing. I cannot\r\nsay that I am yet satisfied as to the nature of the flash. A simple\r\nexplanation of the result obtained, when two dry pebbles are rubbed\r\ntogether in the air, is that crushed particles of the quartz or of\r\nthe corundum are heated by the heavy friction to the glowing point.\r\nBut this does not accord with the fact that submergence in a liquid\r\ndoes not interfere with the flashing. The rise of temperature would\r\ncertainly be checked by the liquid. And the curious smell produced is\r\nin no way explained.\r\n\r\nThe breaking of crystals is in many instances known to produce a\r\nflash of light. Thus a lump of loaf sugar broken in the dark gives a\r\nfaint flash of blue light, as anyone can see for himself immediately\r\non reading this. White arsenic crystals also, when broken by shaking\r\nthe liquid in which they have formed, give out flashes of light. Some\r\nrare specimens of diamond, when rubbed in the dark with a chamois\r\nleather, glow brightly. The well-known mineral called Derbyshire spar,\r\n\"Blue John,\" or fluoride of calcium, when heated to a point much below\r\nthat of a red-hot iron, \"crackles\" and glows briefly with a greenish\r\nlight. The crystals of phosphate of lime, called apatite, and a number\r\nof other crystals have this property. But there is no record of any\r\npeculiar smell accompanying the flashes of light. It is still a matter\r\nopen to investigation as to whether the flashing of pieces of quartz\r\nand rock-crystal when rubbed together with heavy pressure is of the\r\nnature of the flashing of the heated crystals of other minerals, or\r\nwhether there is any chemical action set up by the friction--an action\r\nwhich is certainly suggested by the very peculiar smell produced.\r\nSince the flashing can be produced under water and other liquids, it\r\nshould be easy to obtain some evidence as to the chemical nature of the\r\nflame--whether acid or alkaline, whether capable of acting on this or\r\nthat reagent dissolved in the water, and whether setting free any gas\r\nof one kind or another.\r\n\r\nAny one of my readers who chooses can produce the wonderful\r\norange-coloured flame by rubbing two quartz or flint pebbles together\r\nin the dark, and can have the further gratification of producing with\r\nthe utmost ease the mysterious and weird phenomenon of a flame under\r\nwater, and may, perhaps, by further experiment, explain satisfactorily\r\nthis unsolved marvel which has haunted some of us since childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nAMBER\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBER is not unfrequently picked up among the pebbles of the East\r\nCoast. I once picked up a piece on the beach at Felixstowe as big\r\nas a turkey's egg, thinking it was an ordinary flint-pebble and\r\nintending to throw it into the sea, when my attention was arrested\r\nby its extraordinary lightness, and I found that I had got hold of\r\nan unusually large lump of amber. There is a locality where amber\r\noccurs in considerable quantity. It is a long way off--namely, the\r\npromontory called Samland near Königsberg on the Prussian shore of\r\nthe Baltic. There it occurs with fossil wood and leaves in strata of\r\nearly Tertiary age, deposited a little later than our \"London clay.\"\r\nIt used to be merely picked up on the shore there until recent times,\r\nwhen \"mining\" for it was started. From this region (the Baltic coast\r\nof Prussia) amber was carried by the earliest traders in prehistoric\r\ntimes to various parts of Europe. Their journeyings can be traced\r\nby the discovery of amber beads in connexion with interments and\r\ndwelling-places along what are called \"amber routes\" radiating from\r\nthe amber coast of Prussia. To reach the East Coast of England the\r\nbits of amber would have to be carried by submarine currents. Amber\r\ntravels faster and farther than ordinary stones, on account of its\r\nlightness. What has been held to be amber is found, also embedded in\r\nancient Tertiary strata, in small quantity in France, in Sicily, in\r\nBurma, and in green sand (below the chalk) in the United States. The\r\nSicilian amber (called \"Simetite\") was not known to the ancients: it is\r\nremarkable for being \"fluorescent,\" as is also some recently discovered\r\nin Southern Mexico. But it is possible that chemically these substances\r\nare not quite the same as true amber. Amber is a fossil resin or\r\ngum, similar to that exuded by many living trees, such as gum-copal.\r\nIt has been used as an ornament from prehistoric times onwards, and\r\nwas greatly valued by the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and by our\r\nAnglo-Saxon ancestors, not only for decorative purposes, but as a\r\n\"charm,\" it being supposed to possess certain magical properties.\r\n\r\nAmber (it is generally believed) comes slowly drifting along the sea\r\nbottom to the Suffolk shore from the Baltic. Lumps as big as one's\r\nfist are sometimes picked up here. The largest pieces on record found\r\non the Baltic shore, or dug out of the mines there, are from 12 to 18\r\nlb. in weight, and valued at £1000. A party sent by the Emperor Nero\r\nbrought back 13,000 lb. of amber from the Baltic shores to Rome. The\r\nbottom currents of seas and oceans, such as those which possibly bring\r\namber to our shores, are strangely disposed. The Seigneur of Sark\r\nsome fifty years ago was shipwrecked in his yacht near the island of\r\nGuernsey; he lost, among other things, a well-fastened, strongly-made\r\nchest, containing silver plate. It was found a year later in deep water\r\noff the coast of Norway and restored to him! In the really deep sea,\r\nover 1000 fathoms down, there are well-marked broad currents which\r\nmay be described as rivers of very cold water (only four degrees or\r\nso above freezing-point). They flow along the deep sea bottom and are\r\nsharply marked off from the warmer waters above and to the side. Their\r\ninhabitants are different from those of the warmer water. They are\r\ndue to the melting of the polar ice, the cold water so formed sinking\r\nat once owing to its greater density below the warmer water of the\r\nsurface currents. These deep currents originate in both the Arctic and\r\nAntarctic regions, and the determination of their force and direction,\r\nas well as of those of other ocean currents, both deep and superficial,\r\nsuch as the warm \"Gulf Stream,\" which starts from the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nand the great equatorial currents, is a matter of constant study and\r\nobservation, in which surveying ships and skilled observers have been\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nAmber has not only been valued for its beauty of colour--yellow,\r\nflame-colour, and even deep red and sometimes blue--for its\r\ntransparency, its lightness, and the ease with which it can be carved,\r\nbut also on account of certain magical properties attributed to it.\r\nPliny, the great Roman naturalist of the first century A.D., states\r\nthat a necklace of amber beads protects the wearer against secret\r\npoisoning, sorcery, and the evil eye. It is first mentioned by Homer,\r\nand beads of it were worn by prehistoric man. Six hundred years B.C., a\r\nGreek observer (Thales) relates that amber when rubbed has the power of\r\nattracting light bodies. That observation is the starting-point of our\r\nknowledge of electricity, a name derived from the Greek word for amber,\r\n\"electron.\" In Latin, amber is called \"succinum.\" By heating in oil\r\nor a sand-bath, amber can be melted, and the softened pieces squeezed\r\ntogether to form larger masses. It can also be artificially stained,\r\nand cloudy specimens are rendered transparent by heating in an oil-bath.\r\n\r\nAmber is the resinous exudation of trees like the \"Copal gum\" of East\r\nAfrica and the \"Kauri resin\" or \"Dammar\" of New Zealand. Both of these\r\nproducts are very much like amber in appearance, and can be readily\r\nmistaken for it. The trees which produced the amber of the Baltic were\r\nconifers or pine trees, and flourished in early Tertiary times (many\r\nmillions of years ago). Their leaves, as well as insects of many kinds,\r\nwhich have been studied and named by entomologists, are found preserved\r\nin it. There is a very fine collection of these insects in the Natural\r\nHistory Museum in London. It is probable that more than one kind of\r\ntree produced the amber-gum, and that its long \"fossilization\" has\r\nresulted in some changes in its density and its chemical composition.\r\nThe East African copal is formed by a tree which belongs to the same\r\nfamily as our beans, peas, and laburnum. It is obtained when freshly\r\nexuded, but the best kind is dug by the negroes out of the ground,\r\nwhere copal trees formerly grew and have left their remains, so that\r\ncopal, like amber, is to a large extent fossilized. The same is true\r\nof the New Zealand dammar or kauri gum, which is the product of a\r\nconifer called \"Agathis australis,\" and is very hard and amber-like\r\nin appearance. Chemically amber, copal, and dammar are similar to one\r\nanother but not identical. Amber, like the other two, has been used for\r\nmaking \"varnish,\" and the early Flemish painters in oils, as well as\r\nthe makers of Cremona violins, made use of amber varnish.\r\n\r\nA medicament called \"eau de luce\" was formerly used, made by dissolving\r\none of the products of the dry distillation of amber (called \"oil\r\nof amber\") in alcohol. Now, however, amber is used only for two\r\npurposes--besides decoration--namely, for the mouthpieces of pipes and\r\ncigar tubes and for burning (for amber, like other resins, burns with\r\na black smoke and agreeable odour) as a kind of incense (especially at\r\nthe tomb of Mahomet at Mecca). These uses are chiefly Oriental, and\r\nmost European amber now goes to the East. In China they use a fine\r\nsort of amber, obtained from the north of Burma. The use of amber as\r\na mouthpiece is connected with its supposed virtues in protecting the\r\nmouth against poison and infection. It is softer than the teeth, and\r\ntherefore pleasant to grip with their aid; but as a cigar or cigarette\r\ntube it is disadvantageous, as it does not absorb the oil which is\r\nformed by the cooling of the tobacco smoke passing along it, but allows\r\nit to condense as an offensive juice.\r\n\r\nForty years ago an old lady used to sit in the doorway of her\r\ntimber-built cottage in the village of Trimley (where there are the\r\nchurches of two parishes in one churchyard), smoking a short clay pipe\r\nand carving bits of amber found on the Suffolk beach into the shape of\r\nhearts, crosses, and beads. She would carve and polish the amber you\r\nhad found yourself whilst you joined her in a friendly pipe. You were\r\nsure in those days of the genuine character of the amber, jet, and\r\nagate sold as \"found on the beach.\" Nowadays these things, as well as\r\npolished agates and \"pebbles from the beach,\" are, I am sorry to say,\r\nmanufactured in Germany, and sent to many British seaside resorts,\r\nlike the false coral and celluloid tortoise-shell which, side by side\r\nwith the genuine articles, are offered by picturesque Levantines to\r\nthe visitors at hotels on the Riviera, and even in Naples itself.\r\nNevertheless, genuine and really fine specimens of amber picked up on\r\nthe beach and polished so as to show to full advantage their beautiful\r\ncolour and \"clouding\" can still be purchased in the jeweller's shop\r\nat Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast near the great pebble beach of\r\nOrfordness.\r\n\r\nThere are difficulties about using the word \"amber\" with scientific\r\nprecision. The fossil resins which pass under this name in commerce,\r\nand are obtained in various localities, including the Prussian mines on\r\nthe Baltic, are undoubtedly the product of several different kinds of\r\ntrees, and, from the strictly scientific chemical point of view, they\r\nare mixtures in varying proportions of different chemical substances.\r\nThe merchant is content with a certain hardness (which he tests with a\r\npenknife), transparency, and colour, and also attaches great importance\r\nto the test of burning a few fragments in a spoon, when, if the\r\nmaterial is to pass as \"amber,\" it should give an agreeable perfume.\r\nScientifically speaking, \"amber\" differs from other \"resins,\" including\r\ncopal, in having a higher melting point, greater hardness, slighter\r\nsolubility in alcohol and in ether, and in containing \"succinic acid\"\r\nas an important constituent, which the other resins, even those most\r\nlike it, do not. True amber thus defined is called \"succinite,\" but\r\nseveral other resins accompany it even as found in its classical\r\nlocality--the Baltic shore of Prussia--and, owing to their viscid\r\ncondition before fossilization, may have become mixed with it. One of\r\nthese is called \"gedanite,\" and is used for ornamental purposes. It is\r\nmore brittle than amber, and contains no succinic acid. It is usually\r\nclear and transparent, and of a pale wine-yellow colour.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to be certain about the exact nature of what\r\nappears to be a \"piece of amber\" thrown up on the seashore, without\r\nchemical examination. A year or two ago a friend brought to me a dark\r\nbrownish-yellow-coloured piece of what looked like amber, which\r\n(so my friend stated) had been picked up on the shore at Aldeburgh.\r\nIt was as big as three fingers of one's hand, very transparent and\r\nfibrous-looking, owing to the presence of fine bubbles in its substance\r\narranged in lines. I found an exactly similar piece from the same\r\nlocality in the collection of the Natural History Museum. It was\r\nlabelled \"copal,\" and, I suppose, had been chemically ascertained to be\r\nthat resin and not \"amber,\" or, to use the correct name, \"succinite.\"\r\nHow either of these pieces got into the North Sea it is difficult to\r\nsay. Though the \"copal\" of commerce is obtained from the West Coast of\r\nAfrica, it may occur (though I have not heard that it does) associated\r\nwith true amber in Prussia. A fossilized resin very similar to copal\r\nis found in the London clay at Highgate and elsewhere near London, and\r\nis called \"copalite.\" It is possible, though not probable, that the\r\nbits of amber found on our East Coast beaches are derived from Tertiary\r\nbeds, now broken up and submerged in the North Sea, and do not travel\r\nto us all the way from the Baltic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSEA-WORMS AND SEA-ANEMONES\r\n\r\n\r\nLET us now leave the beach-pebbles and go down on to the rocks at low\r\ntide in order to see some of the living curiosities of the seashore.\r\nThere are some seaside resorts where, when the tide goes down, nothing\r\nis exposed but a vast acreage of smooth sand, and here the naturalist\r\nmust content himself with such spoils as may be procured by the aid\r\nof a shrimping-net and a spade. Wading in the shallow water and using\r\nhis net, he will catch, not only the true \"brown shrimp,\" but other\r\nshrimp-like creatures, known as \"crustacea\"--a group which includes\r\nalso the lobsters, hermit-crabs, true crabs, and sand-hoppers, as well\r\nas an immense variety of almost microscopic water-fleas.\r\n\r\nHe will also probably catch some of the stiff, queer little\r\n\"pipe-fish,\" which are closely related to the little creatures known as\r\n\"sea-horses.\" Pipe-fish are very sluggish in movement, almost immobile,\r\nwhilst the \"sea-horse\" or hippocampus--only to be taken by the dredge\r\namongst corallines in deep water on rocky bottoms (as, for instance,\r\nin the Channel Islands)--goes so far as to curl his tail, like a South\r\nAmerican monkey, round a stem of weed and sit thus upright amidst the\r\nvegetation. Even when disturbed he merely swims very slowly and with\r\nmuch dignity in the same upright position, gently propelled by the\r\nundulating vibratory movement of his small dorsal fin. The male in both\r\npipe-fish and sea-horses is provided with a sac-like structure on the\r\nventral surface in which he carries the eggs laid by the female until\r\nthey are hatched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--British Marine Worms or Chætopods.\r\n\r\na, Arenicola piscatorum. Lug-worm largely used for bait by\r\nsea-fishermen. It burrows in sea-sand and clay as the earth-worm does\r\nin soil.

The figure is one-third of the natural size,\r\nlinear.]\r\n\r\nThe shrimper will probably catch also some very young fish\r\nfry--including young flat-fish about 2 inches long. If he explores the\r\nexposed surface of sand near the low-tide limit, he will find a variety\r\nof indications of burrowing animals hidden beneath. Little coiled\r\nmasses like the \"castings\" of earth-worms are very abundant in places,\r\nand are produced by the fisherman's sand-worm, or \"lug-worm\" (Fig.\r\n4, a). A vigorous digging to the depth of a foot or two will reveal\r\nthe worm itself, which is worth bringing home in a jar of sea-water\r\nin order to see the beautiful tufts of branched gills on the sides of\r\nthe body, which expand and contract with the flow of bright red blood\r\nshowing through their delicate walls. Other sand-worms, from 2 to 6\r\ninches long, will at the same time be turned up,--worms which have some\r\nhundred or more pairs of vibrating legs, or paddles, arranged down the\r\nsides of the body, and swim with a most graceful, serpentine curving of\r\nthe mobile body (Fig. 4, b). These sea-worms are but little known to\r\nmost people, although they are amongst the most beautifully coloured\r\nand graceful of marine animals. Hundreds of different kinds have been\r\ndistinguished and described and pictured in their natural colours.\r\nEach leg is provided with a bundle of bristles of remarkable shapes,\r\nresembling, when seen under a microscope, the serrated spears of South\r\nSea Islanders and mediaeval warriors. These worms usually have (like\r\nthe common earth-worm) red blood and delicate networks of blood-vessels\r\nand gills (Fig. 4, c), whilst the head is often provided with eyes and\r\nfeelers. They possess a brain and a nerve-cord like our spinal cord,\r\nand from the mouth many of them can suddenly protrude an unexpected\r\nmuscular proboscis armed with sharp, horny jaws, the bite of which is\r\nnot to be despised. These \"bristle-worms,\" or \"chætopods,\" as they are\r\ntermed by zoologists, are well worth bringing home and observing in a\r\nshallow basin holding some clean sea-water.\r\n\r\nAt many spots on our coast (_e.g._ Sandown, in the Isle of Wight, and\r\nthe Channel Islands) rapid digging in the sand at the lowest tides will\r\nresult in the capture of sand-eels, a bigger and a smaller kind, from\r\n1 foot to 6 inches in length. These are eel-shaped, silvery fish,\r\nwhich swim near the shore, but burrow into the soft sand as the tide\r\nrecedes. They are excellent eating. We used at Sandown to make up a\r\nparty of young people to dig the smaller \"sand-eels,\" or \"sand-launce.\"\r\nThe agility and rapid disappearance of the burrowing fish into the sand\r\nwhen one thought one had safely dug them out, rendered the pursuit\r\ndifficult and exciting. Then a wood fire on the beach, a frying-pan,\r\nfat, flour, and salt were brought into operation, and the sand-eels\r\nwere cooked to perfection and eaten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--The shell of the Heart-urchin (Spatangus\r\npurpureus) with its spines rubbed off. One-fourth the actual diameter.]\r\n\r\nSome of the marks or small heaps of sand on the flats exposed at low\r\ntide are characteristic of certain shell-fish. The \"razor-fish\" (Fig.\r\n19, b)--a very much elongated clam, or mussel, with astonishing powers\r\nof rapid burrowing--leaves a hole on the surface like a keyhole,\r\nabout an inch long. It can be dug up by an energetic spadesman, but\r\na spoonful of common salt poured over the opening of its burrow will\r\ncause it to suddenly shoot out on to the surface, when it may be\r\npicked up, and the hunter spared any violent exertion. The curious\r\nheart-urchin (Fig. 5), as fragile as an egg-shell, and covered with\r\nlong, closely-set spines like a brush, is often to be found burrowing\r\nin the sand, as well as the transparent, pink-coloured worm known as\r\nSynapta, in the skin of which are set thousands of minute calcareous\r\nanchors hinged to little sculptured plates. These burrowers swallow the\r\nsand and extract nutriment from stray organic particles mixed in it.\r\n\r\nThe mere sand-flat of the low tide is not a bad hunting ground; but\r\nthe rock pools, often exposed when the tide is out, and the fissures\r\nin the rocks and the under surfaces of slabs of rock revealed by\r\nturning them over--are the greatest sources of varied delight to the\r\nsea-shore naturalist. It is well to take a man with you on to these\r\nrocks to carry your collecting bottles and cans, and to turn over for\r\nyou the larger slabs of loose stone, weighing as much as a couple of\r\nhundredweight. The most striking and beautiful objects in these rock\r\npools are the sea-anemones (Fig. 6 and Frontispiece). They present\r\nthemselves as disk-like flowers from 1 to 5 inches in diameter, with\r\nnarrow-pointed petals of every variety of colour, set in a circle\r\naround a coloured centre. The petals are really hollow tentacles\r\ndistended with sea-water, and when anything falls on to them or touches\r\nthem they contract and draw together towards the centre. The centre\r\nhas a transverse opening in it which is the mouth, and leads into a\r\nlarge, soft-walled stomach, separated by its own wall from a second\r\nspacious cavity lying between that wall and the body wall, and sending\r\na prolongation into each tentacle. The stomach opens freely at its\r\ndeep end into this second \"surrounding\" chamber, which is divided by\r\nradiating cross walls into smaller partitions, one corresponding to\r\neach tentacle. The nourishing results of digestion, and not the food\r\nitself, pass from the stomach into the subdivided or \"septate\" second\r\nchamber. There is thus only one cavity in the animal, separable into a\r\ncentral and a surrounding portion.\r\n\r\nIn this respect--in having only one body cavity--sea-anemones and the\r\ncoral-polyps and the jelly-fishes and the tiny freshwater polyp or\r\nhydra, and the marine compound branching polyps like it--agree with\r\none another and differ from the vast majority of animals, such as\r\nworms, sea-urchins, star-fishes, whelks, mussels, crustaceans, insects,\r\nspiders and vertebrates (which last include fish, reptiles, birds, and\r\nmammals). These all have a second chamber, or body cavity, quite shut\r\noff from the digestive cavity and from the direct access of water and\r\nfood particles. This second distinct chamber is filled with an animal\r\nfluid, the lymph, and is called the \"Cœlom\" (a Greek word meaning a\r\ncavity). These higher animals, which possess a cœlom as well as a\r\ngut, or digestive cavity, are called \"Cœlomata,\" or \"Cœlomocœla,\"\r\nin consequence; whilst the sea-anemones, polyps, and jelly-fish form\r\na lower grade of animals devoid of cœlom, but having the one cavity,\r\nor gut, continued into all parts of the body. Hence they are called\r\n\"Cœlentera,\" or \"Enterocœla,\" words which mean that the cavity of\r\ntheir bodies (Greek _cœl_) is made by an extension of the gut, or\r\ndigestive cavity (Greek _enteron_). The higher grade of animals--the\r\nCœlomocœla--very usually have a vascular system, or blood-vessels and\r\nblood, as well as a cœlom and lymph, and quite independent of it; also\r\nsome kind of kidneys, or renal excretory tubes. Neither of these are\r\npossessed by the sea-anemones and their allies--the Enterocœla--but\r\nthey have, like higher animals, a nervous system and also large ovaries\r\nand spermaries on the walls of their single body cavity, which produce\r\ntheir reproductive germs. These pass to the exterior, usually through\r\nthe mouth, but sometimes by rupture of the body wall.\r\n\r\nAll \"one-cavity\" animals, the Enterocœla or Cœlentera, produce\r\npeculiar coiled-up threads in their skin in great quantity--many\r\nthousands--often upon special warts or knobs. These coiled-up threads\r\nlie each in a microscopic sac; they are very delicate and minute\r\nand carry a virulent poison, so that they are \"stinging\" threads.\r\nExcitement of the animal, or mere contact, causes the microscopic sac\r\nto burst, and the thread to be violently ejected. The sea-anemones,\r\njelly-fish, and polyps feed on fresh living animals, small fish,\r\nshrimps, etc., and catch their prey by the use of these poisonous\r\nthreads. Some jelly-fish have them big enough to act upon the human\r\nskin, and bathers are often badly stung by them. The commonest\r\njelly-fish do not sting, but where they occur a few of the stinging\r\nsort are likely to occur also. Even some sea-anemones can sting\r\none's hand with these stinging threads. One sea-anemone (known as\r\n\"Cerianthus\"), occasionally taken in British waters, makes for itself\r\na leathery tube by the felting of its stinging threads, and lines its\r\nlong burrow in the sand below tidal exposure in this way.\r\n\r\nThe sea-anemones are very hardy, and they are wonderfully varied and\r\nabundant on our coasts. Some sixty years ago a great naturalist, who\r\nloved the seashore and its rock-pools enthusiastically, Mr. Philip\r\nHenry Gosse, father of Mr. Edmund Gosse, the distinguished man of\r\nletters, described our British sea-anemones, and gave beautiful\r\ncoloured pictures of them. One of these I have taken for the\r\nfrontispiece of this volume, and some of the outline figures of marine\r\nanimals in these chapters are borrowed from a marvelously complete and\r\nvaluable little book by him--now long out of print--entitled \"Marine\r\nZoology.\" His books--of high scientific value--and his example, made\r\nsea-anemones \"fashionable.\" London ladies kept marine aquariums in\r\ntheir drawing-rooms stocked with these beautiful flowers of the\r\nsea. They were exhibited in quantity at the Zoological Gardens in\r\nRegent's Park, and it is by no means a creditable thing to our London\r\nzoologists that neither these nor other marine creatures are now to be\r\nseen there. At a later date public marine aquaria were started with\r\nsuccess in many seaside towns,--Brighton, Scarborough, Southport,\r\netc.--and a very fine one was organized in Westminster and another at\r\nthe Crystal Palace. It is an interesting and important fact, bearing\r\non the psychology of the British people, that most of these charming\r\nexhibitions of strange and beautiful creatures from the depths of the\r\nsea were very soon neglected and mismanaged by their proprietors; the\r\ntanks were emptied or filled with river water, and the halls in which\r\nthey were placed were re-arranged for the exhibitions of athletes,\r\nacrobats, comic singers, and pretty dancers. These exhibitions are\r\noften full of human interest and beauty--but I regret the complete\r\ndisappearance of the fishes and strange submarine animals. I have\r\nsome hope that before long we may, at any rate in the gardens in\r\nthe Regent's Park, see really fine marine and fresh-water aquaria\r\nestablished, more beautiful and varied in their contents than those of\r\nearlier days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--British Sea-Anemones.\r\n\r\na, Sagartia bellis, the daisy anemone, viewed from above when fully\r\nexpanded.\r\n\r\nb, Bunodes crassicornis, half expanded; side view.\r\n\r\nc, Anthea cereus. The tentacles are pale apple-green in colour, tipped\r\nwith mauve, and cannot be completely retracted.\r\n\r\nd, Actinia mesembryanthemum. The disk of tentacles is completely\r\nretracted. This is the commonest sea-anemone on our South Coast, and is\r\nusually maroon colour, but often is spotted like a strawberry.]\r\n\r\nThere are four kinds of sea-anemones which are abundant on our coast.\r\nThey adhere by a disk-like base to the rocks and large stones, and\r\nhave the power of swelling themselves out with sea-water (as have many\r\nsoft-bodied creatures of this kind), with all their tentacles expanded.\r\nThey have, in that condition, the shape of small \"Martello\" towers,\r\nwith their adhesive disk below and the mouth-bearing platform above,\r\nfringed by tapering fingers; and they can, on the other hand, shrink to\r\na fifth part of their expanded volume, drawing in and concealing their\r\ntentacles, which are in some kinds perforated at the tip. One common on\r\nthe rocks at Shanklin and other parts of our South Coast, but not on\r\nthe East Coast, has very abundant, long, pale green tentacles, which\r\nare tipped with a brilliant peach colour, and it is peculiar in not\r\nbeing able to retract or conceal this beautiful crown of snake-like\r\nlocks, reminding one of the Gorgon Medusa. It is known as Anthea cereus\r\n(Fig. 6, c). Many of them are known by the name \"Actinia,\" and the\r\ncommonest of all (Fig. 6, d) is called \"Actinia mesembryanthemum,\"\r\nbecause of its resemblance to a fleshy-leaved flower of that name\r\nwhich grows on garden rockeries--sometimes called the \"ice-plant.\"\r\nThis one is of a deep maroon colour, rarely more than an inch and a\r\nhalf across the disk. The adhesive disk is often edged with bright\r\nblue, and small spherical tentacles, of a bright blue colour, are set\r\nat intervals outside the fringe of longer red ones. This anemone lives\r\nwonderfully well in a small glass basin or in an aquarium holding a\r\ngallon of sea-water, which is kept duly aerated by squirting it daily.\r\nOne lived in Edinburgh for more than fifty years, in the possession\r\nfirst of Sir John Dalyell, and then of Mr. Peach. She was known as\r\n\"Granny,\" and produced many hundreds of young in the course of years.\r\nThis species is viviparous, the young issuing from the parent's mouth\r\nas tiny fully-formed sea-anemones, which immediately fix themselves\r\nby their disks to the glass wall of their habitation. Anemones kept\r\nthus in small aquaria have to be carefully fed; bits of the sea mussel\r\n(of course, uncooked) are the best food for them. This and many other\r\nkinds are not absolutely stationary, but can very slowly crawl by\r\nmeans of muscular movements of the adhesive disk. There are kinds of\r\nsea-anemones known which spend their lives floating in the ocean; they\r\nare thin and flat. Others adhere to the shells of hermit crabs and\r\neven to the big claws of some crabs, and profit by the \"crumbs\" of\r\nfood let fall by the nippers of their host. A very handsome and large\r\nsea-anemone is common on the East Coast, and is known as \"crassicornis\"\r\n(its generic name is Bunodes). When distended it measures as much as\r\n4 inches across (Fig. 6, b). I have one at this moment before me,\r\nexpanded in a bowl of sea-water. The tentacles are pale green or grey,\r\nbanded with deep red, and the body is blotched with irregular patches\r\nof red, green, and orange. It attaches fine pebbles and bits of shell\r\nto the surface of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCORAL-MAKERS AND JELLY-FISH\r\n\r\n\r\nA VERY beautiful kind of sea-anemone (common at Felixstowe) is the\r\nDaisy or Sagartia troglodytes, (Fig. 6, a), which has a very long body\r\nattached to a rock or stone far below the sandy floor of the pool,\r\non the level of which it expands its thin, long, ray-like tentacles,\r\ncoloured dark brown and white, and sometimes orange-yellow. As soon as\r\nyou touch it it disappears into the sand, and is very difficult to dig\r\nout. The most beautifully coloured of all sea-anemones are the little\r\nCorynactids (half an inch across), which you may find dotted about\r\nlike jewels, each composed of emerald, ruby, topaz, and creamy pink\r\nand lilac, on the under surface of slabs of rock at very low tide in\r\nthe Channel Islands. One of the most puzzling facts in natural history\r\nis that these lovely little things live in the dark. No eye, even\r\nof fish or crab, has ever seen what you see when you turn over that\r\nstone. It is a simple demonstration of the truth of the poet Gray's\r\nstatement, that many a gem of purest ray serene is concealed in the\r\ndark, unfathomed depths of ocean! A splendid anemone is the Weymouth\r\nDianthus (see the frontispiece of this volume), so named because it is\r\ndredged up in Weymouth Bay. It is often six inches long, and has its\r\nvery numerous, small tentacles arranged in lobes, or tufts, around the\r\nmouth. It is either of a uniform bright salmon-yellow colour or pure\r\nwhite. When kept in an aquarium it fixes itself by its disk on the\r\nglass wall, and often, as it slowly moves, allows pieces of the disk to\r\nbecome torn off and remain sticking to the glass. These detached pieces\r\ndevelop tentacles and a mouth, and grow to be small and ultimately\r\nfull-sized Weymouth anemones.\r\n\r\nIf the disk were spread out and gave rise to little anemones without\r\ntearing--so that they remained in continuity with the parent--we\r\nshould get a composite or compound animal, made up of many anemones,\r\nall connected at the base. This actually happens in a whole group\r\nof polyps resembling the sea-anemones. They grow into \"stocks,\"\r\n\"tree-like\" or \"encrusting\" masses, consisting of hundreds and even\r\nthousands of individuals, each with its mouth and tentacles, but with\r\ntheir inner cavities and bases united. These are the \"coral polyps,\" or\r\n\"coral-insects\" of old writers, of so many varied kinds. One further\r\nfeature of great importance in a \"coral\" is the production of a hard\r\ndeposit of calcite, or limestone, which is thrown down by the surface\r\nof the adhesive disk, and is also formed in deep, radiating \"pockets,\"\r\npushed in to the soft animal from the disk. The hard deposit of calcite\r\nis continuous throughout the \"stock,\" or \"tree,\" and when the soft\r\nsea-anemone-like animals die, the hard, white matter is left, and is\r\ncalled \"coral.\" Very commonly this white coral shows star-like cups\r\non its surface, which correspond to the lower ends or disks of the\r\nsoft sea-anemone-like creatures which deposited the hard coral. In a\r\nless common group (represented commonly on our coast by the so-called\r\n\"Dead men's fingers\" found growing on the overhanging edges of low-tide\r\nrocks) the hard coral material does not form cups for the minute\r\nsea-anemones which secrete it, but takes the form of a supporting\r\ncentral or axial rod (sea-pens), or branched tree (sea-bushes), upon\r\nwhich the fleshy mass of polyps are tightly set. This is the case with\r\nthe precious red and pink coral of the Mediterranean (which is now\r\nbeing \"undersold\" actually in the Mediterranean markets by a similar\r\nred coral from Japan, usually offered as the genuine article, which it\r\nis not!).\r\n\r\nOn the British coast you do not, as a rule, find coral-forming polyps.\r\nA small kind, consisting of two or three yellow and orange-red\r\nanemone-polyps united and producing a small group of hard calcite\r\ncups (Caryophyllia and Balanophyllia) is not uncommon at Plymouth at\r\na few fathoms depth. But you have to go to the Norwegian fiords or\r\nelse far out to sea where you have 300 fathoms of sea-water in order\r\nto get really luxuriant white corals--the beautiful Lophohelia (Fig.\r\n3, p. 9), which I used to dredge in the Nord Fiord near Stavanger, as\r\nbranching, shrub-like masses of a foot cube in area, each white marble\r\ncup standing out from the stem, an inch long and two-thirds of an\r\ninch across, and the stems giving support to a whole host of clinging\r\ngrowths (among them Rhabdopleura!) and sheltering wonderful deep-water\r\nworms and starfish.\r\n\r\nBut these, beautiful as they are, are nothing, so far as mass and\r\ndominating vigour of growth are concerned, in comparison with the\r\nreef-building corals of the warm seas of the tropics. There these\r\nlime-secreting conglomerated sea-anemones separate annually hundreds of\r\ntons of solid calcite per square mile of sea bottom from the sea-water,\r\nand build up reefs, islands, and huge cliffs of coral rock. They\r\nget the calcite--as do calcareous seaweeds and shell-making clams,\r\noysters, whelks, and microscopic chalk-makers--from the sea--the water\r\nof the sea which always has it ready in solution for their use. And the\r\nsea gets it from the rivers and streams which wear away and dissolve\r\nthe old limestone deposits now raised into mountain chains, as well as\r\nby itself dissolving again in due course what living creatures have so\r\ncarefully separated from it. Sea water or fresh water with a little\r\ncarbonic acid gas dissolved in it dissolves limestone and chalk--it\r\nbecomes what we call \"hard.\" Neutralize the dissolved carbonic acid\r\n(as is done in the well-known Clark's process for softening water),\r\nand down falls the dissolved calcite as a fine white sediment. These\r\nalternating processes of solution and \"precipitation\" are always going\r\non in the waters of the earth and sea.\r\n\r\nThe name \"jelly-fish\" has reference to the colourless, transparent,\r\nsoft, and jelly-like substance of the bodies of the animals to which it\r\nis applied. There are a number of marine animals, besides the common\r\njelly-fish, belonging to different classes, which are glass-like in\r\ntransparency and colourless--so as to be nearly or quite invisible in\r\nclear water, and some, too, occur in fresh waters (larvæ of gnats,\r\nnotably of the plume-horned gnat Corethra). The transparency of these\r\nanimals serves them in two different ways--some are enabled by it to\r\nescape from predatory enemies; others, on the contrary, are enabled\r\nto approach their own prey without being observed. The latter was\r\nobviously the case with the little fresh-water jelly-fish which\r\nappeared in great abundance some years ago in the lily tank in Regent's\r\nPark. The water was full of small water-fleas (minute crustacea),\r\nand the little jelly-fish, if removed from the tank and placed in a\r\ntall glass jar filled with the tank water, spent its whole time in\r\nswimming upwards to the surface by the alternate contraction and\r\nexpansion of its disk-like body, and then dropping gently through the\r\nfull length of the jar to the bottom, when it would again mount. On\r\nthe downward journey--owing to its transparency--it would encounter\r\nunsuspecting, jerkily-moving water-fleas, unwarned by any shadow\r\ncast by the impending glass-like monster of half an inch in breadth\r\nslowly approaching from above; and as soon as they touched it they\r\nwere paralysed (by microscopic poison-threads like those of the\r\nsea-anemones), and were grasped and swallowed by the mobile transparent\r\nproboscis (like that of an elephant, though certainly smaller, and\r\nhaving the mouth opening at its end, instead of a nostril), which hangs\r\nfrom the centre of the disk-like jelly-fish.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] See \"Science from an Easy Chair\" (First Series, 1910), p. 60, for a\r\nfurther account and figure of the freshwater jelly-fish.\r\n\r\nThere are some glass-like transparent creatures, including some small\r\nfishes, which live at 500 fathoms depth and a good deal deeper on the\r\nsea bottom. We know that the sun's light does not penetrate below\r\n200 fathoms, so that one is led to ask--What is the good of being\r\ntransparent if you live at the bottom of the sea, at a greater depth\r\nthan this? There is also a very beautiful prawn, which I dredged in\r\nNorway in 200 fathoms, which looks like a solid piece of clearest,\r\ncolourless glass. And then there are some very beautiful little stalked\r\ncreatures (called Clavellina), fixed to the under-side of rocks in the\r\ntidal zone, which are absolutely like drops of solid glass an inch\r\nlong. One cannot easily imagine how colourless transparency can be of\r\n\"life-saving value\" to these varied inhabitants of the dark places of\r\nthe sea bottom--any more than we can assign any life-saving value to\r\nthe brilliant, gem-like colouring of some of the sea-anemones which\r\nlive in the dark on the under-surface of rocks.\r\n\r\nThe most probable view of the matter is that neither the colourless\r\ntransparency of the one set nor the brilliant colouring of the other\r\nhas any value; it just happens to be so, and is not harmful. So, for\r\ninstance, some crystals are colourless, some blue or green or yellow\r\nor red, without any advantage to them! On the other hand, we know that\r\na large number of the animals which live in the dark unfathomed depths\r\nthemselves produce light, that is to say, are phosphorescent, and it\r\nseems probable that at great depths, though there is no sunlight,\r\nthe sea bottom is illuminated--we can only vaguely guess to what\r\ndegree--by the strange living lanterns--fish, crustaceans, worms,\r\nand even microscopic creatures--which move about in quest of their\r\nfood, carrying their own searchlight with them. Another suggestion is\r\nthat the eyes of these inhabitants of the dark may be more sensitive\r\nthan our own, and even be affected by rays invisible to us. This,\r\nhowever, is not probable, since whilst there are among them some with\r\nenormous eyes, we find that at the greatest depths (2 to 4 miles)\r\neven the fishes have no eyes at all, and at a depth of a mile there\r\nare many shrimp-like creatures in which the eyes have been completely\r\ntransformed into peculiar \"feelers,\" or otherwise aborted. So that we\r\ncannot suppose there is a possibility of developing the eye of the\r\ndwellers in deep-sea darkness to a degree of sensitiveness greatly\r\nbeyond that of terrestrial animals. A limit of obscurity is reached\r\nat which it is of no use having an eye at all, and eyes cease to have\r\nlife-saving value, and accordingly are not maintained by natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nThe transparency and colourlessness of marine animals which float near\r\nthe surface is, on the other hand, obviously useful, and to this group\r\nour jelly-fishes belong. Not only do they escape observation by their\r\ntransparency and general absence of colour, but some actually have a\r\nblue transparent colouring which blends with the blue colour of the\r\nsea. Such are the gas-holding, bladder-like sac as large as your fist\r\ncalled the \"Portuguese man-of-war,\" and the little sailing Velella,\r\nboth of which float, and even protrude above the surface, so as to\r\ncatch the wind. Others are only semi-transparent, and others are marked\r\nwith strong red, brown, or yellow streaks. Many of the smallest kinds\r\nof jelly-fish have eyes which are bright red in colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--A common British Jelly-fish.\r\n\r\nAurelia aurita, usually as large as a breakfast-plate and often larger.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe animals to which the name \"jelly-fishes\" is now more or less\r\nstrictly applied are (as that fine zoologist Aristotle knew) in their\r\nstructure closely similar to the sea-anemones, but even simpler. They\r\nare called the Medusæ by naturalists. Their disk-like bodies are\r\nlargely formed by a jelly-like material, on the surface of which are\r\nstretched delicate transparent skin, nerves, and delicate muscles,\r\nwhilst in the middle of the disk, on the surface which faces downwards\r\nas the creature floats, is the mouth, leading into a relatively small\r\npouched cavity excavated in the jelly, from which a delicate system of\r\ncanals is given off, and radiates in the jelly of the disk. There is,\r\nas in the sea-anemones, only one continuous cavity. The edge of the\r\ndisk is beset with fine, sensitive tentacles, sometimes many feet in\r\nlength, and the lips of the mouth are often drawn out into a sort of\r\ndepending trunk, or into four large tapering lobes or lips of jelly,\r\nwhich, with the longer tentacles, are used for seizing prey. The\r\ncommonest jelly-fish on our coast--so common as to be \"the\" jelly-fish\r\n_par excellence_--is often to be seen left on the sands by the receding\r\ntide or slowly swimming in quiet, clear water at the mouth of a river\r\nin enormous numbers. It is known as \"Aurelia\" (Fig. 7). It is as big\r\nas a cheese-plate, and the four pouches connected with the stomach\r\nare coloured pink or purple, and appear in the middle of the circular\r\nplate of jelly, like a small Maltese cross. The reproductive particles\r\n(germ-cells and sperm-cells) are produced in that coloured region, and\r\nescape by the mouth. There is a fringe of fine, very short tentacles\r\nround the edge of the disk, and they, as well as the great lobes of\r\nthe mouth, are provided with innumerable coiled-up stinging hairs\r\nor \"thread-cells,\" similar to those of the sea-anemones, which led\r\nAristotle to call both groups \"sea-nettles.\" Eight stalked eyes are set\r\nat equal intervals around the disk.\r\n\r\nUsually accompanying the floating crowd of the common and abundant\r\nAurelia are a few specimens of a very unpleasant kind of Medusa of a\r\nturbid appearance, often called \"slime balls\" by fishermen, from six\r\ninches to a foot in diameter. It is known to naturalists by the name\r\n\"Cyanæa capillata.\" The tentacles on the edge of the disk of this kind\r\nof jelly-fish are very long and elastic, stretching to several feet,\r\neven yards, in length, and are provided with very powerful stinging\r\nhairs. The tentacles not infrequently become coiled around the body of\r\na bather; the stinging hairs are shot out of the little sacs in which\r\nthey are rolled up, and the result may be very painful to the person\r\nstung in this way and even dangerous. There are two other common large\r\njelly-fish on the English coast, one called \"Chrysaora\" (Fig. 8), with\r\na wheel-like pattern of brown pigment on the disk, and the other with\r\nthe mouth lobes very large and bound together like a column.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--A common British Jelly-fish.\r\n\r\nChrysaora hysoscella, usually twice as big as the figure.]\r\n\r\nThe common Aurelia is remarkable for the fact that the young which\r\nhatch from its eggs attach themselves to stones and rocks on the sea\r\nbottom, and grow into little white tube-like polyps, about half an\r\ninch long, quite unlike their parent, with a crown of small tentacles\r\nsurrounding the mouth, whilst they are fixed by the opposite end of\r\nthe body. Then a very curious thing happens. The little polyp becomes\r\nnipped at intervals across its length, so that it looks like a pile\r\nof saucers--a dozen or more. And then the top saucer swims away as a\r\nminute jelly-fish, the next follows, and so on, so that, in the course\r\nof an hour or two, the whole pile separates into a number of freely\r\nswimming young, each of which gradually grows into a full-sized\r\nAurelia. I have only once had the chance of witnessing this beautiful\r\nsight, and that was many years ago in a tank at the Zoological Gardens\r\n(they have no such tanks now), where the polyp-like young (called\r\n\"Hydra tuba\") spontaneously put in an appearance, and proceeded to\r\nbreak up into piles of little disks, which separated and swam off as\r\none watched them. The French poet, Catulle Mendés, imagined a world\r\nwhere the flowers flew about freely and the butterflies were fixed to\r\nstalks. His fancy is to some degree realized by the swimming away of\r\nthe young jelly-fish from their stalks. There are a host of very minute\r\njelly-fish, measuring when full grown only half an inch or less in\r\ndiameter. They originate as buds from small branching polyps, one kind\r\nof which is common on oyster-shells, and is called \"the herring-bone\r\ncoralline.\" The dried skins of these coralline polyps (which are horny)\r\nare often to be picked up with masses of seaweed on the seashore after\r\na storm. The little jelly-fish are the ripe individuals of the polyps,\r\nand produce eggs and sperm which grow to be polyp-trees. These, again,\r\nafter growing and branching as polyps, give rise to little jelly-fish\r\nhere and there on the tree, which in most kinds (though not in all)\r\nbreak off and swim away freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSHRIMPS, CRABS, AND BARNACLES\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have no word in English to indicate the varied crab-and-shrimp-like\r\ncreatures of salt and fresh waters in the same way as \"insect\"\r\ndesignates the six-legged, usually winged, terrestrial creatures\r\nof many kinds--beetles, bees, bugs, two-winged flies, dragonflies,\r\nday-flies, and butterflies. They are all \"insects.\" Naturalists call\r\nthe aquatic shrimp-and-crab creatures \"crustaceans.\" Perhaps \"crab\"\r\nmight be used in a large sense to include them all, together with the\r\ntrue crabs, as the Germans use their word, \"krebs.\" The shore-crab is\r\nthe most familiar of all crustaceans, in the living, moving condition.\r\nBoiled lobsters, prawns, and shrimps are more generally familiar\r\nmembers of the class, but the \"undressed\" living crab is better known\r\nto every one who has been on the seashore than the live lobster,\r\nprawn, and shrimp. Londoners have been heard to express interest in\r\nthe curious blue variety of lobster caught on the coast, not being\r\naware that the hot bath which he takes before he, too, is \"dressed,\"\r\ncauses his blue armour to change its colour to a brilliant scarlet.\r\nOccasionally a regular ordinary lobster is caught in which this change\r\nhas occurred during life in the sea--and there are some enormous\r\ndeep-sea prawns of a pound in weight which when living have a splendid\r\ncrimson colour. A large series of \"crustaceans,\" carefully prepared so\r\nas to show their natural colours in life, is exhibited in the Natural\r\nHistory Museum in Cromwell Road.\r\n\r\nA curious kind of prawn (by name Althea rubra), of fair size, is found\r\nunder \"the low-tide rocks\" in the Channel Islands, which not only is\r\nof a deep crimson colour, but snaps his fingers at you--or rather\r\none of his fingers--or claws--when you try to catch him, making a\r\nloud crack audible at ten yards distance. The common big prawn, if\r\nyou see him in a large vessel of sea-water with the light shining\r\nthrough him, appears very brilliantly marked with coloured bands and\r\nspots--reddish-brown, blue, and yellow--which are displayed on a\r\ntransparent, almost colourless surface. Of course, boiling turns him\r\npale red. A common smaller species of prawn when boiled is often sold\r\nas \"pink shrimps,\" and lately a deep-sea prawn--a third species--has\r\ncome from the Norwegian coast into the London market. There are many\r\nkinds which are not abundant enough to become \"marketable.\" Prawns\r\nare at once distinguished from the true \"brown shrimp\" by having the\r\nfront end of the body drawn out into a sharp-toothed spine, which\r\nis absent in the shrimp. Besides the prawns (Palæmon and Pandalus),\r\nthe shrimp (Crangon), and the common lobster (Homarus), you may see\r\nin the London fish shops the large spiny lobster (Palinurus) called\r\n\"langouste\" by the French, and apparently preferred by them as a table\r\ndelicacy to the common lobster, although it has no claws. It used to\r\nbe called \"craw-fish\" or \"sea craw-fish\" in London; why, I am unable\r\nto say. The name was certainly bad, as it leads to confusion with the\r\ncray-fish, the fresh-water lobster of British and all European rivers\r\n(there are many other kinds of fresh-water lobsters in other parts of\r\nthe world, as well as fresh-water prawns and crabs), whose English\r\nname is a curious corruption of the French one, \"écrevisse\" (cray-vees,\r\ncray-fish). Another lobster of our markets is the little one known as\r\nthe \"Dublin prawn,\" which is common enough on the Scotch and Norwegian\r\ncoasts, as well as that of Ireland. Naturalists distinguish it as\r\nNephrops Norvegicus. The great edible crab completes the list of\r\nBritish marketable crustaceans, but in Paris I have eaten, as well as\r\nat Barcelona, a very large Mediterranean prawn, three times as big as\r\nour biggest Isle of Wight prawns, but by no means so good. It is called\r\n\"Barcelona prawn\" and \"Langostino\" (\"Penæus\" by naturalists). In Madrid\r\nI have seen in the fish shops and eaten yet another crustacean--a very\r\ncurious one--namely, a long-stalked rock-barnacle of the kind known to\r\nnaturalists as Pollicipes.\r\n\r\nThat the barnacles--ship's barnacles (Fig. 10) and with them the\r\nlittle sea-acorns (Fig. 11), those terribly hard and sharp little\r\nwhite \"pimples\" which cover the rocks nearly everywhere just below\r\nhigh-tide mark, and have so cruelly lacerated the hands and shins\r\nof all of us who swim and have had to return to a rocky shore in a\r\nlively sea--should be included with crabs, lobsters, and shrimps as\r\n\"crustaceans\" must appear astonishing to every one who hears it for the\r\nfirst time. The extraordinarily ignorant, yet in their own estimation\r\nlearned, fishermen of the Scottish coast will tell you with solemn\r\nassurance that the ubiquitous encrusting sea-acorns are the young\r\nof the limpet, whilst the creature living inside the shell of the\r\nlong-stalked ship's barnacles has for ages been discoursed of by the\r\nlearned as one of the marvels of the sea--nothing more or less than a\r\nyoung bird--the young, in fact, of a goose--the barnacle goose which,\r\nsince it was thus proved to be a fish in origin, was allowed to be\r\neaten by good Catholics on fast days! Two hundred years or more ago\r\nthis story was discredited by serious naturalists, but the barnacles\r\nand sea-acorns were thought (even by the great Cuvier) to be of the\r\nnature of oysters, mussels, and clams (Molluscs), because of their\r\npossessing white hard shells in the form of \"valves\" and plates, which\r\ncan open and shut like those of mussels. Their true history and nature\r\nwere shown about eighty years ago by a great discoverer of new things\r\nconcerning marine creatures, Dr. Vaughan Thompson, who was Army Medical\r\nInspector at Cork, and studied these and other animals found in the\r\nwaters of Queenstown Harbour.\r\n\r\nThe crab class, or Crustacea, have, like the insects, centipedes,\r\nspiders, and scorpions, a body built up of successive rings\r\nor segments. The earth-worms (as every one knows) and marine\r\nbristle-bearing worms also show this feature in the simplest and\r\nmost obvious way. The vertebrates, with their series of vertebræ or\r\nbackbone-pieces and the body muscles attached ring-wise to them, show\r\nthe same condition. The marine worms have a soft skin and a pair of\r\nsoft paddle-like legs upon each ring of the body, often to the number\r\nof a hundred such pairs. But the crab class and the classes called\r\ninsects, centipedes, arachnids, and millipedes are remarkable for the\r\nhard, firm skin, or \"cuticle,\" which is formed on the surface of their\r\nbodies and of their legs, which, as in the marine worms, are present--a\r\npair to each body-ring or segment--often along the whole length of\r\nthe body as in centipedes. This hard cuticle is impregnated with lime\r\nin the bigger members of the crab class, such as the lobster. It is\r\nnot equally thick and hard all over the surface of the lobster, but\r\nis separated by narrow bands of thin, soft cuticle into a number of\r\nharder pieces, thus rendered capable of being bent or \"flexed\" on one\r\nanother. Thus the body is jointed into a series of rings, and the legs\r\nare also divided each into several joints (as many as seven), which\r\ngives them flexibility and so usefulness of various kinds. The various\r\njoints are \"worked\" by powerful muscles, which are fixed internally to\r\nthe cuticle and pass from one hard ring or segment, whether of body or\r\nof leg, to a neighbouring ring.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the structure of a lobster's tail and of its legs,\r\nwhich can be readily examined in illustration of my statement, and\r\nthe same structure can be seen in the leg of a beetle or a fly.\r\nNaturalists term all this series of creatures with hard-jointed\r\ncuticle, to which the muscles are attached, including the crab class,\r\nthe insects, centipedes, spiders, and scorpions, \"jointed-leg owners,\"\r\nor Arthropods. It is easy to appreciate this characteristic difference\r\nwhich separates the Arthropods from other animals. The sea-worms differ\r\nfrom them, in that they have soft cuticle, but stiffen and render their\r\npaddle-like legs firm by squeezing the liquid of the body into them in\r\nthe same sort of way as the sea-anemones distend their tentacles with\r\nliquid, though in that case the liquid is sea-water taken in by the\r\nmouth. The Molluscs also distend their muscular lobe, or \"foot\" as it\r\nis called, by pressing the blood from the rest of the body into it, and\r\nso making it swell and become stiff, so that the muscles can work it;\r\nwhen not distended in that way it is flaccid. The Vertebrates (bony\r\nanimals) and the star-fishes have again another and peculiar mechanism.\r\nTheir muscles are attached to hard internal pieces, sometimes\r\ncartilaginous but often calcareous or bony, which are spoken of as \"the\r\ninternal skeleton.\" There are thus three distinct kinds of mechanism in\r\nanimals for giving the necessary resisting surfaces, hinged or jointed\r\nto one another, and made to \"play\" one on the other by the alternate\r\ncontraction and relaxation of the muscles attached to them.\r\n\r\nThe Arthropods differ among themselves in the number of body-rings,\r\nthe enlargement or dwindling of certain rings, and the fusion of a\r\nlarger or smaller number of the rings to form a composite head, or a\r\njointless mid-body or hind-body. The successive legs are primarily and\r\nessentially like to one another, and each body-ring, with its pair of\r\nlegs, is but a repetition of its fellows. At the same time, in the\r\ndifferent classes included as \"Arthropoda\" a good deal of difference\r\nhas been attained in the structure of the legs, and they have in each\r\nclass a different form and character in successive regions of the\r\nbody, distinctive of the class, and are sometimes, but not always,\r\nabsent from many of the hinder rings. All these Arthropods agree in\r\nhaving a leg on each side immediately behind the mouth--belonging to a\r\nbody-ring, which is fused with others to form the head--very specially\r\nshortened, of great strength and firmness, and shaped so as to be\r\npulled by a powerful muscle attached to it, against its fellow of the\r\nopposite side, which is similarly pulled. These two stumpy legs form\r\nthus a powerful pair of nippers called \"the mandibles.\" They are jaws,\r\nalthough they were in the ancestors of the Arthropods merely legs.\r\nThese jaw-legs, or leg-jaws, are characteristic of all the crab class,\r\nas well as of the other Arthropods, but no bristle-worm or other animal\r\nhas them. The jaws of marine worms are of a totally different nature.\r\nSo are the jaws of snails, whelks, and cuttle-fish. Many of the crab\r\nclass have not one only, but several, pairs of legs following the\r\nmouth converted into jaws. Thus, if you examine a big shore-crab, or,\r\nbetter, an edible crab, and a lobster, and a large prawn, you will find\r\nthat they all have five pairs of legs converted into short foliaceous\r\njaws (hence called \"foot-jaws\"), and overlying the first very strong\r\npair, or mandibles.\r\n\r\nFollowing these \"foot-jaws\" you find in a crab or a lobster the great\r\nnipping claws and the four large walking legs--the same in proportion\r\nand shape in crab, lobster, and prawn, much bigger than the foot-jaws.\r\nBut the curious thing is that if you set them out and carefully compare\r\nthem (for they are not simple jointed limbs, but each has two or even\r\nthree diverging stems carried on a basal joint), you will find a\r\nstrange and fascinating \"likeness in unlikeness,\" or an agreement of\r\nthe parts of which they are built, and yet a difference between all of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe rings of the body to which the jaw-legs and legs are attached are\r\nfused into one unjointed piece. The spine in front of the mouth and\r\nthe support of the eyes and the feelers or \"antennæ\" are fused with\r\nthat piece. It forms on the back a great shield--often called \"the\r\nhead\"--which overhangs and is bent down over the sides of this region,\r\nso as to protect the gills, which you can see by cutting away the\r\noverhanging flap.\r\n\r\nFollowing on the jaw-legs or foot-jaws and walking-legs, in the three\r\ncrustaceans we are looking at, comes the jointed tail or hind-body,\r\nconsisting of seven pieces. The first five rings of the tail have small\r\n=Y=-shaped legs, a pair to each ring. They are called \"swimmerets,\"\r\nwhilst the sixth has legs of the same shape, but very large and flat.\r\nIn the middle between these large flat legs is the last ring, which\r\nhas no legs, but is perforated by the opening of the intestine. You\r\nwill see if you compare the crab and the lobster (or the prawn, which\r\nis very much like the lobster), that the crab has the so-called head\r\n(really head and mid-body combined) drawn out from side to side, so as\r\nto make it much wider than it is long. And, moreover, the jointed tail\r\nor hind-body seems at first sight to be absent in the crab. But if you\r\nturn the crab (a dead one) on his back, you will find that he has a\r\ncomplete tail, on the whole like that of the lobster, but pointed and\r\nbent forwards, and closely packed under the fused head and mid-body in\r\na groove, from which you can raise it and turn it back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--The larval or young form of Crustacea known as\r\n\"the Nauplius.\" This is the \"Nauplius\" of a kind of Prawn. The three\r\npairs of branched limbs are well seen. Much magnified.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have not yet done with the various forms assumed by the legs of our\r\nthree crustaceans--for, actually in front of the mouth, there are two\r\npairs of peculiarly altered legs. Originally in crab-ancestors, and at\r\nthe present day in the very minute young stage of growth called \"the\r\nNauplius\" (Fig. 9), the mouth was not behind these two front pairs.\r\nIt has sunk back as it were, gradually moved so as to leave the legs\r\nin front of it. As we now see them in the crab, lobster, and prawn,\r\nthe two pairs of legs in front of the mouth are jointed filamentous\r\nthings--the feelers or antennæ--very long in prawns and lobsters, short\r\nin crabs. In the ancestors of crabs, lobsters, and prawns these feelers\r\nwere undoubtedly swimming legs. In the \"nauplius\" stage (Fig. 9) of\r\nsome prawns, and in many minute crustaceans often called \"water-fleas,\"\r\nwe find these feelers not acting as mere sensory organs of touch, but\r\nrelatively strong and large, with powerful muscles, striking the water\r\nand making the little creatures bound or jump through it in jerks.\r\n\r\nIt has been discovered that in the growth from the egg of many\r\ncrustaceans the young hatches out as a \"nauplius\" with only three\r\npairs of legs. The front two pairs later gradually grow to be the\r\nfeelers, the third pair become eventually the mandibles or first pair\r\nof jaw-legs. These legs all present themselves at first as active,\r\npowerful swimming \"oars,\" beset with peculiar feathery hairs and\r\nnot in the shape which they later acquire. The kite-shaped nauplius\r\nbaby-phase, smaller than a small flea, with its three pairs of\r\nviolently jerking legs, is a very important little beast. It is the\r\nexistence of this young stage in the growth of barnacles and sea-acorns\r\nwhich has demonstrated that they are crustaceans, that is to say,\r\nbelong to the crab class. The fixed shell-like barnacles and sea-acorns\r\nhatch from their eggs each as a perfect little \"nauplius,\" like that\r\ndrawn in Fig. 9. They swim about with jerking movements caused by\r\nthe strokes of the two front legs and of the pair which will become\r\nthe mandibles. Their limbs have the special form and are beset with\r\nthe feather-like hairs, and the whole creature has the kite-like\r\nshape--characteristic of the nauplius young of other Crustacea. They\r\nare indeed indistinguishable from those young. Whilst it was the Army\r\ndoctor, Vaughan Thompson, who discovered that barnacles are strangely\r\naltered \"shrimps,\" it was Darwin who made one of the most interesting\r\ndiscoveries about them--a discovery of which he was always, and\r\nrightly, very proud--as I will explain in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nBARNACLES AND OTHER CRUSTACEANS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ship's barnacle looks at first, when you see one of a group of them\r\nhanging from a piece of floating timber, like a little smooth, white\r\nbivalve shell, as big as your thumb-nail, at the end of a thickish,\r\nworm-like stalk, from one to ten inches long (Fig. 10). But you will\r\nsoon see that there are not only two valves to the white shell, but\r\nthree smaller ones as well as the two principal ones. This does not\r\nseparate them altogether from the bivalve-shelled molluscs (mussels,\r\nclams, oysters), for the bivalve molluscs, which bore in stone and\r\nclay, have small extra shelly plates, besides the two chief ones,\r\nwhilst the Teredo, or ship's worm--a true bivalve mollusc--has an\r\nenormously long, worm-like body which favours a comparison with it of\r\nthe long-stalked barnacle. If a group of barnacles is floating attached\r\nto a piece of timber undisturbed in a tank of sea-water you will see\r\nthe little shells gape, and from between them a bunch of curved,\r\nmany-jointed feelers will issue and make a succession of grasping or\r\nclawing movements, as though trying to draw something into the shell,\r\nwhich, in fact, is what they are doing--namely, industriously raking\r\nthe water on the chance of bringing some particle of food to the mouth\r\nwhich lies within the shell (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--The Common Ship's Barnacle, Lepas anatifera,\r\nnatural size. The name \"Anatifera,\" the \"goose-bearer,\" was given to\r\nthis species by Linnæus in reference to the legend of its giving birth\r\nto young geese.\r\n\r\n_st._, stalk.\r\n\r\n_cir._, cirri, or double hairy legs.\r\n\r\n_pe._, opening of the seminal duct.\r\n\r\n_sc._, scutum; _t_, tergum, the two plates or shells of the left side;\r\n_c_, the middle piece or shell called the \"carina.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is not every one who has the chance of seeing living ship's\r\nbarnacles (Lepas), but anyone can pick up a stone or bit of rock on the\r\nseashore with live sea-acorns or acorn-barnacles (Balanus) adherent to\r\nit. Each is like a little truncated volcano (Fig. 11), the sides of\r\nwhich correspond to the pair of larger shells of the ship's barnacle,\r\nfused together and grown into a cone-like wall. The acorn-barnacle\r\nhas no stalk, but adheres by its broad base to the stone. Just within\r\nthe shelly crater are four small hinged plates or valves in pairs,\r\nidentical with the smaller shelly bits of the ship's barnacle. When\r\nyou first see your specimen, the valves are tightly closed. After a\r\nfew minutes in a glass of sea-water they open right and left, and up\r\njumps--jack-in-the-box-wise--a tuft of bowing and scraping feelers or\r\ntentacles, like those of the ship's barnacle. If disturbed, they shoot\r\ninwards, and the valves close on them like a spring trapdoor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--A large British Sea-acorn, Balanus porcatus,\r\nallied to the Ship's Barnacle. _l_, the feather-like legs issuing from\r\nthe shell. Drawn of the natural size.]\r\n\r\nNow, these clawing, feathery little plumes are found, when we examine\r\nthem with a hand-glass, to be six pairs in number, and each of them\r\nis =Y=-shaped, like the swimmerets of a lobster. The arms of the =Y=\r\nare built up of many little joints and covered with coarse hairs. As a\r\nresult of the study of the young condition of the ship's barnacle and\r\nthe sea-acorn, we find that these six pairs of =Y=-shaped plumes are\r\nsix pairs of legs corresponding to those of the mid-body (some of the\r\nwalking legs and some of the foot-jaws) of the lobster, and that the\r\nshelly hinged plates of the barnacles correspond to the overhanging\r\nsides of the \"head\" of the lobster and prawn, which one can imagine\r\nto be hinged along a line running down the back so as to open like\r\nthe covers of a book. There are very common little, free-swimming\r\n\"water-fleas\" (minute crustaceans) of many hundreds of kinds which have\r\nhinged shells of this description when in the full-grown condition,\r\nand it is found that the young barnacles and sea-acorns pass through a\r\nfree-swimming phase of growth (the Cyprid stage), in which they greatly\r\nresemble these \"water-fleas.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is quite easy to hatch the young from the eggs of either\r\nship's barnacles or acorn-barnacles at the right season of the\r\nyear. They commence life as do so many Crustacea--in the \"nauplius\r\nstate,\" with three pairs of jerking limbs (Fig. 9). As they grow the\r\noverhanging pair of shells, delicate and transparent, appear; the three\r\npairs of nauplius legs lose their swimming power; the most anterior\r\n(always called antennules in all crustaceans) become elongated and\r\nprovided each with an adhesive sucker, on the face of which a large\r\ncement gland opens, secreting abundant adhesive cement; the second pair\r\n(antennæ) shrivel and disappear altogether; the third pair lose their\r\nlong blades for striking the water and remain as simple, but strong,\r\nstumps--the mandibles! Two new pairs of little jaw-feet appear behind\r\nthese, and farther back on the now enlarged body (the whole creature\r\nis not bigger than a small canary seed!) six pairs of =Y=-shaped legs\r\nappear and strike the water rhythmically, so that the little creature\r\nswims with some sobriety. The region to which these legs are attached\r\nis marked with rings or segments, and behind it follows a small,\r\nlimbless, hind body of four segments, or joints, ending with two little\r\nhairy prongs like a pitchfork. The right and left movable, shell-like\r\nfold, or downgrowth, of the sides of the body encloses the whole\r\ncreature except the protruding antennules with their suckers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Two stages in the growth of the Common\r\nBarnacle from the Nauplius stage. Diagrammatic.\r\n\r\n_cir._, the double legs or cirri; _m_, mouth; _o_, the single eye; _d_,\r\nthe digestive canal.\r\n\r\n_a′_, one of the antennules or \"feelers\" (that of the right side of\r\nthe head) provided with a sucking disk by means of which the young\r\nanimal becomes fixed.]\r\n\r\nIn this condition it swims about for a time, and then, once for all,\r\nfixes itself by means of the suckers and their abundant cement, on\r\nto rock, stone, or floating wood--and there remains for the rest of\r\nits life (Fig. 12). It increases enormously in size, the delicate\r\ntransparent shell develops into hard calcareous plates, opening and\r\nshutting on the hinge-line of the back. In the stalked kinds a peculiar\r\nelongated growth of an inch or several inches in length takes place\r\nbetween the mouth and the fixed suckers of the antennules (Figs. 10\r\nand 12); in the short, so-called, \"acorn\" kinds, this stalk does\r\nnot form, but a separate part of the shell grows into a ring-like\r\nprotective wall or cone. The creature is thus actually fastened by\r\nits head--\"upside down, with its legs sticking up\" not in the air, but\r\nin the water. Those six pairs of =Y=-shaped legs, though no longer\r\nenabling the barnacle to swim, increase in relative size, and keep up\r\ntheir active movements. It is they which emerge like a plume when the\r\nvalves of the shell open and carry on the rhythmic bowing and scraping\r\nmovement described above.\r\n\r\nThe barnacles have, in fact, undergone a transformation which may\r\nbe compared to that experienced by a man who should begin life as\r\nan active boy running about as others do, but be compelled suddenly\r\nby some strange spell or Arabian djin to become glued by the top of\r\nhis head to the pavement, and to spend his time in kicking his food\r\ninto his mouth with his legs. Such is the fate of the barnacles, and\r\nit is as strange and exceptional amongst crustaceans as it would be\r\namongst men. Indeed, to \"earn a living\" human acrobats will submit\r\nto something very much like it. It is this change from the life of a\r\nfree-living shrimp to that of a living lump, adherent by its head to\r\nrocks or floating logs, that Vaughan Thompson in 1830 discovered to\r\nbe the story of every barnacle, and so showed that they were really\r\ngood crustaceans gone wrong, and not molluscs. It is a curious fact\r\nthat the young ascidian or sea-squirt which swims freely and has the\r\nshape of a tadpole, also when very young fixes itself by the top of its\r\nhead to a rock or piece of seaweed, and remains immovable for the rest\r\nof its life. Though agreeing in their strange fixation by the head,\r\nthe barnacle and the ascidian are very different kinds of animals.\r\n(For some account of the Ascidian the reader may consult the chapter\r\n\"Tadpoles of the Sea\" in \"Science from an Easy Chair,\" Second Series.\r\nMethuen, 1912.)\r\n\r\nThe name \"Cirripedes\" is commonly used for the order or group formed\r\nby the barnacles--in allusion to the plume-like appearance of their\r\n\"raking\" legs. Stalked barnacles often are found in the ocean attached\r\nto floating pumice-stone, and one species has been discovered attached\r\nto the web of the foot of a sea-bird. They, like many other creatures,\r\nbenefit by being carried far and wide by floating objects. Whales have\r\nvery large and solid acorn-barnacles peculiar to them, fixed deeply in\r\ntheir skin. Others attach themselves to marine turtles.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions the crustaceans are of separate sexes, male and\r\nfemale. But in nearly all classes of animals we find some kinds,\r\neven whole orders, in which the ovaries and spermaries are present\r\nin one and the same individual. \"Monœcious\" or \"one-housed\"--that\r\nis to say, possessing one house or individual for both ovaries and\r\nspermaries--is the proper word for this condition, but a usual term for\r\nit is \"hermaphrodite.\" \"Diœcious\" is the term applied to animals or\r\nplants in which there are two kinds of individuals--one to carry the\r\nspermaries, the male, and the other to carry the ovaries, the female.\r\nIt is probable that the monœcious condition has preceded the diœcious\r\nin all but unicellular animals. In vertebrate animals as high as the\r\nfrogs and the toads we find rudimentary ovaries in the male, and in\r\nindividual cases both ovaries and spermaries are well developed. Such\r\na condition is not rare as an individual abnormality in fishes. In\r\nsome common species of sea-perch (Serranus) and others it is not an\r\nexception but the rule.\r\n\r\nMany groups of molluscs are monœcious, and it is not in any way\r\nastonishing to find a group of crustaceans which are so. The\r\nCirripedes or barnacles are an example. It is probable that the\r\npresence of ovaries and spermaries in the same individual--the\r\nmonœcious condition--is an advantage to immovable fixed animals.\r\nDuring the voyage of the \"Beagle,\" and making use on his return of the\r\ncollections then obtained, Darwin carried out a very thorough study\r\nof the Cirripedes of all kinds from all parts of the world. He worked\r\nout their anatomy minutely, classified the 300 different kinds then\r\nknown, and described many new kinds. The stalked barnacles often occur\r\nin groups, the individuals being of different ages and sizes, the\r\nsmall young ones sometimes fixing themselves by their sucker-bearing\r\nheads to the stalks of their well-grown relatives. In all the varied\r\nkinds studied by Darwin he found that the full-grown individuals\r\nwere monœcious--that is, of combined sex--as was known to be the\r\ncase in those studied before his day. But Darwin made the remarkable\r\ndiscovery that in two kinds of stalked barnacles (not the common ship's\r\nbarnacles), comprising several species, \"dwarf males\" were present\r\nperched upon the edge of the shell of the large monœcious (bi-sexual)\r\nindividuals. These dwarf males were from one-tenth to one-twentieth\r\nthe length of the large normal monœcious individuals, but usually\r\npossessed the characteristic details of the shell-valves and other\r\nfeatures of the latter.\r\n\r\nThis existence of a sort of supernumerary diminutive kind of male as\r\nan accompaniment to a race of normal monœcious individuals was quite\r\na new thing when Darwin discovered it. That all the males in some\r\ndiœcious animals are minute as compared with the females was known,\r\nand has been established in the case of some parasitic crustaceans,\r\nin some of the wheel-animalcules, and in the most exaggerated degree\r\nin the curious worms, Bonellia and Hamingia. But the existence of\r\n\"complemental males,\" as Darwin called them, existing apparently in\r\norder to fertilize the eggs should they escape fertilization by the\r\nordinary monœcious individuals, was a new thing. And it was doubted\r\nand disputed when Darwin described his observations fifty-six years\r\nago. They were, in fact, by many regarded as a distinct species\r\nparasitic upon the larger barnacles on which they were found until\r\nDarwin's conclusion as to their nature was confirmed by the report of\r\nDr. Hoek, on the barnacles brought home by the \"Challenger\" expedition.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that recent studies have shown that in\r\nsome of the barnacles with dwarf males (species of Scalpellum) the\r\nlarge individuals are no longer monœcious, but have become purely\r\nfemales, whilst in some other species dwarf males have been discovered\r\nwhich have rudimentary ovaries. Thus we get gradations leading from\r\none extreme case to the other. Darwin always felt confidence in his\r\noriginal observations on this matter, and was proportionately delighted\r\nwhen, after thirty years, his early work was proved to be sound.\r\nIn the Natural History Museum at the Darwin centenary in 1909, a\r\ntemporary exhibition of specimens, note-books, and letters associated\r\nwith Darwin's work, was brought together. His original specimens and\r\ndrawings of Cirripedes and of the wonderful little \"complemental males\"\r\nof the barnacles were placed on view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BARNACLE AND THE GOOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE curious belief, widely spread in former ages--that the creatures\r\n(described in the last chapter) called \"barnacles\" or \"ship's\r\nbarnacles\"--often found attached in groups to pieces of floating\r\ntimber in the sea as well as fixed to the bottoms of wooden ships--are\r\nthe young of a particular kind of goose called \"the barnacle goose,\"\r\nwhich is supposed to hatch out of the white shell of the long-stalked\r\nbarnacle, is a very remarkable example of the persistence of a\r\ntradition which is entirely fanciful. It was current in Western Europe\r\nfor six or seven centuries, and was discussed, refuted, and again\r\nattested by eminent authorities even as late as the foundation of the\r\nRoyal Society--the first president of which, Sir Robert Moray, read a\r\npaper at one of the earliest meetings of the society in 1661, in which\r\nhe described the bird-like creature which he had observed within the\r\nshell of the common ship's barnacle, and favoured the belief that a\r\nbird was really in this way produced by a metamorphosis of the barnacle.\r\n\r\nThe story was ridiculed and rejected by no less a philosopher than\r\nRoger Bacon in the thirteenth century, and was also discredited by\r\nthe learned Aristotelian Albertus Magnus at about the same time. No\r\ntrace of it is to be found in Aristotle or Herodotus or any classical\r\nauthor, nor in the \"Physiologus.\" The legend seems to have originated\r\nin the East, for the earliest written statement which we have\r\nconcerning it is by a certain Father Damien, in the eleventh century,\r\nwho simply declares: \"Birds can be produced by trees, as happens in\r\nthe island of Thilon in India.\" We have also a reference to the same\r\nmarvel in an ancient Oriental book (the \"Zohar,\" the principal book\r\nof the Kaballah), as follows: \"The Rabbi Abba saw a tree from the\r\nfruits of which birds were hatched.\" The earliest written statements of\r\nthe legend are, it appears, to the effect that there is a tree which\r\nproduces fruits from which birds are hatched. The belief in the story\r\nseems to have died out at the end of the seventeenth century, when the\r\nstructure of the barnacle lying within its shell was examined without\r\nprejudice, and it was seen to have only the most remote resemblance to\r\na bird. The plumose legs or \"cirrhi\" of the barnacle (Fig. 10) have a\r\nsuperficial resemblance to a young feather or possibly to the jointed\r\ntoes of a young bird, and there the possibilities of comparison end.\r\n\r\nThe notion that a particular kind of black goose (a \"brent\"), which\r\noccurs on the marshy coast of Britain in great numbers, is _the_\r\ngoose, _the_ bird, produced by the barnacle was favoured by the fact\r\nthat this goose does not breed in Britain, and yet suddenly appears\r\nin large flocks, in districts where barnacles attached to rotting\r\ntimber are often drifted on to the shore. It was accordingly assumed by\r\nlearned monks--_who already knew the traveller's tale_, that in distant\r\nlands birds are produced by the transformation of barnacles--that\r\nthis goose is the actual bird which is bred from the barnacles, and\r\nit was accordingly called \"the barnacle goose.\" I think that this\r\nidentification was due to the exercise of a little authority on the\r\npart of the clergy in both France and Britain, who were thus enabled to\r\nclaim the abundant \"barnacle goose\" as a fish in its nature and origin\r\nrather than a fowl, and so to use it as food on the fast-days of the\r\nChurch. Pope Innocent III (to whom the matter was referred) considered\r\nit necessary in 1215 to prohibit the eating of \"barnacle geese\" in\r\nLent, since although he admitted that they are not generated in the\r\nordinary way, he yet maintained (very reasonably) that they live and\r\nfeed like ducks, and cannot be regarded as differing in nature from\r\nother birds.\r\n\r\nThus we see that in early and even later days a good deal hung on the\r\ntruth of this story of the generation of barnacle geese. The story\r\nwas popularly discussed by the devout and by sceptics, and appears to\r\nhave been known in France as \"l'histoire du canard.\" At last in the\r\nseventeenth century it was finally discredited, owing to the account\r\ngiven by some Dutch explorers of the eggs and young of the barnacle\r\ngoose--like those of any other goose--and its breeding-place in the far\r\nnorth on the coast of Greenland. The discredited and hoary legend now\r\nbecame the type and exemplar of a marvellous story which is destitute\r\nof foundation, and so the term \"un canard\" (short for histoire d'un\r\ncanard), commonly applied in French to such stories, receives its\r\nexplanation. Our own term for such stories, in use as long since as\r\n1640, namely, \"a cock-and-bull story,\" has not been traced to its\r\nhistorical source.[3]\r\n\r\n[3] Probably it means \"a silly story told by a cock to a bull!\" as\r\nsuggested by the French word _coq-à-l'âne_, which means a story told or\r\nfit to be told by a cock to an ass!\r\n\r\nThat the story of the goose or duck and the transformed barnacle was\r\na popular one in Shakespear's time, whether believed or disbelieved,\r\nappears from his reference to barnacles in \"The Tempest.\" Caliban says\r\nto Stephano and Trinculo, when they have all three been plagued by\r\nProspero's magic, and plunged by Ariel into \"the filthy mantled pool\"\r\nnear at hand, \"dancing up to their chins\": \"We shall lose our time and\r\nall be turned to barnacles, or to apes with foreheads villainous low.\"\r\nProbably enough, this is an allusion to the supposed Protean nature of\r\nbarnacles. They are not alluded to elsewhere in Shakespear.\r\n\r\nOne of the most precise accounts of the generation of geese by\r\nbarnacles is that of the mediaeval historian Giraldus Cambrensis,\r\nwho visited Ireland and wrote an account of what he saw in the time\r\nof Henry II, at the end of the twelfth century. He says: \"There are\r\nin this place many birds which are called Bernacæ; Nature produces\r\nthem, against Nature, in a most extraordinary way. They are like\r\nmarsh-geese, but somewhat smaller. They are produced from fir timber\r\ntossed along the sea, and are at first like gum. Afterwards they hang\r\ndown by their beaks as if they were a seaweed attached to the timber,\r\nand are surrounded by shells in order to grow more freely. Having thus\r\nin process of time been clothed with a strong coat of feathers, they\r\neither fall into the water or fly freely away into the air.\" \"I have\r\nfrequently seen,\" he proceeds, \"with my own eyes, more than a thousand\r\nof these small bodies of birds, hanging down on the seashore from a\r\npiece of timber, enclosed in their shells and ready formed. They do not\r\nbreed and lay eggs like other birds; nor do they ever hatch any eggs\r\nnor build nests anywhere. Hence bishops and clergymen in some parts of\r\nIreland do not scruple to dine off these birds at the time of fasting,\r\nbecause they are not flesh nor born of flesh!\"\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that Giraldus does not state--in accordance with the\r\ntradition as reported by earlier writers--that there is a tree the\r\nbuds of which become transformed into the geese, but says merely that\r\nthe \"small bodies of birds,\" clearly indicating by his description\r\ngroups of ship's barnacles, are \"produced from fir timber tossed along\r\nthe sea.\" It is also noteworthy that he calls the geese themselves\r\n\"Bernacæ,\" which is the Celtic name for a shell-fish.\r\n\r\nLater the belief seems to have reverted to the older tradition,\r\nor probably enough the complete story, including the existence of\r\nthe bird-producing tree, existed in its original form in \"seats of\r\nlearning\" in other parts of the British Islands outside Ireland, and\r\nalso in Paris and other places in Western Europe. For we find that in\r\n1435 the learned Sylvius, who afterwards became Pope Pius II, visited\r\nKing James of Scotland in order, among other things, to see the\r\nwonderful tree which he had heard of as growing in Scotland from the\r\nfruit of which geese are born. He complains that \"miracles will always\r\nflee further and further,\" for when he had now arrived in Scotland and\r\nasked to see the tree, he was told that it did not grow there, but\r\nfarther north, in the Orkneys. And so he did not see the tree.\r\n\r\nIn 1597, John Gerard, in the third book of his \"Herbal, or History\r\nof Plants,\" writes as follows: \"There are found in the north parts\r\nof Scotland and the Islands adjacent called Orchades, certaine trees\r\nwhereon do grow certaine shell-fishes of a white colour tending to\r\nrussett, wherein are contained little creatures which shels in\r\ntime of maturity doe open and out of them grow those little living\r\nthings which, falling into the water, doe become foules whom we call\r\nBarnacles, in the north of England Brent Geese, and in Lancashire Tree\r\nGeese.\" Gerard is here either adopting or suggesting an identification\r\nof the tradition of the tree which produces birds from its buds, with\r\nthe floating timber bearing ship's barnacles, which were supposed to\r\ngive birth to the brent geese. He does not say that he has seen, or\r\nknows persons who have seen, the barnacles attached to the branches\r\nof living trees. Nevertheless, he gives a picture of them so attached\r\n(Fig. 13). It has been suggested, in later times, that such a fixation\r\nof barnacles to the branches of living trees might occur in some of\r\nthe sea-water lochs of the west of Scotland,--just as oysters become\r\nattached to the mangrove trees in the West Indies,--and it has further\r\nbeen suggested that willows might thus droop their branches into the\r\nsea-water, and that the catkins on the willow-shoots might be taken\r\nfor an early stage of growth of the barnacles; but I have not come\r\nacross any record of such fixation of barnacles on living shrubs or\r\nbranches of trees, and I am inclined to think that Gerard's story of\r\nwhat occurs in the distant Orkneys is merely an attempt to substantiate\r\nthe bird-producing tree of the Oriental story, by quietly assuming that\r\nthe sea-borne timber covered with barnacles existed somewhere as living\r\ntrees and exhibited this same property of budding forth barnacles\r\nwhich on opening liberated each a minute gosling. Gerard continues as\r\nfollows: \"But what our eyes have seen and hands have handled we shall\r\ndeclare.\" There is, he tells us, a small island in Lancashire called\r\nthe Pile of Foulders, and there rotten trees and the broken timbers of\r\nderelict ships are thrown up by the sea. On them forms \"a certain spume\r\nor froth which in time breeds into certaine shells.\" He then gives a\r\ndescription of these shells and the fish contained therein, which is\r\na correct enough account of the common ship's barnacle. He proceeds,\r\nhowever, to an assertion which is not of something which he saw or\r\nhandled, namely, that the animal within the shell, though like the fish\r\nof an oyster, gradually grows to a bird and comes forth hanging to the\r\nshell by its bill. Finally, he says, it escapes to maturity. At the end\r\nof his chapter on this subject, Gerard says: \"I dare not absolutely\r\navouch every circumstance of the first part of this history concerning\r\nthe tree which beareth those buds aforesaide, but will leave it to a\r\nfurther consideration.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--The picture of the \"Goose Tree,\" copied from\r\nthe first edition of Gerard's \"Herbal.\"\r\n\r\nThe fruit-like oval bodies are \"barnacles\" (Lepas) fancifully\r\nrepresented as growing like buds or fruit on a little tree. Some\r\nof the young geese are drawn as in the act of escaping from the\r\nbarnacle-shells, and others are represented swimming in the water.]\r\n\r\nGerard's \"Herbal\" was reprinted forty years later (in 1636) and edited\r\nby Johnson, a member of the Society of Apothecaries. He writes with\r\ncontempt of Gerard's credulity as to the story of the barnacle and the\r\ngoose, and states that certain \"Hollanders\" in seeking a north-east\r\npassage to China had recently come across some islands in the Arctic\r\nSea which were the breeding-place of the so-called barnacle goose, and\r\nhad taken and eaten sixty of their eggs, besides young and old birds.\r\n\r\nProbably there were always lovers of the marvellous and the occult who\r\nfavoured and would favour to-day the tradition of the conversion of\r\none animal into another and such wonders; and there were also both in\r\nthe days of ancient Greece and Rome, and even in the darkest of the\r\nMiddle Ages, men with a sceptical and inquiring spirit, who accepted no\r\ntraditional testimony, but demanded, as the basis of their admitting\r\nsomething unlikely as nevertheless true, the trial of experiment and\r\nthe examination of specimens. What has happened since Gerard's time and\r\nthe incorporation of the Royal Society in 1662, is that the sceptical\r\nmen have got the upper hand, though not without much opposition. In\r\nthis country, owing to the defective education administered in our\r\npublic schools and older universities, there is still quite a large\r\nnumber of well-to-do people ready to believe in any \"occult\" imposture\r\nor fantasy that may be skilfully brought to their notice.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we must bear in mind when we consider these strange\r\nbeliefs held by really learned and intelligent men in the past, that\r\nthe investigation of nature had not advanced very far in their time.\r\nIt was not held, as it is to-day, as an established fact that living\r\nthings are generated only by slips or cuttings of a parent or from eggs\r\nor germs which are special detached particles of the parent. It was\r\nheld to be a matter of common observation and certainty that all sorts\r\nof living things are \"spontaneously generated\" by slime, by sea foam,\r\nby mud, and by decomposing dead bodies of animals and trees. It was\r\nalso held, in consequence of a blind belief in, and often a complete\r\nmisunderstanding of, the legends and fairy tales of the ancients and\r\nof the preposterous \"Bestiaries\" and books on magic which were the\r\nfashion in mediaeval times, that it is quite a usual and natural thing\r\nfor one animal or plant to change into another. Hence there was nothing\r\nvery surprising (though worthy of record) in a barnacle changing into\r\na young goose, or in the buds of a tree becoming in some conditions\r\nchanged into barnacles!\r\n\r\nSo, too, the notion that rotting timber can \"generate\" barnacles\r\nwas not, to our forefathers, at all out of the way or preposterous.\r\nSir Thomas Browne in 1646 was unable to make up his mind on this\r\nmatter, and believed in the spontaneous generation of mice by wheat,\r\nto which he briefly alludes in his curious book called \"Pseudodoxia\r\nEpidemica, or an Enquiry into Vulgar and Common Errors.\" The account\r\nof the creation given by the poet Milton was based upon the belief in\r\nthe daily occurrence of such spontaneous generation of living things\r\nof high complexity of structure and large size, from slime and mud.\r\nThe process of creation of living things conceived by him was but a\r\ngeneral and initial exhibition of an activity of earth and sea which\r\nin his belief was still in daily operation in remote and undisturbed\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nIn 1668 the Italian naturalist, Redi, demonstrated that putrefying\r\nflesh does not \"spontaneously breed\" maggots. He showed that if a piece\r\nof flesh is protected by a wire network cover from the access of flies,\r\nno maggots appear in it, and that the flies attracted by the smell of\r\nthe meat lay their eggs on the wire network, unable to reach the meat,\r\nwhilst if the wire cover is removed they lay their eggs on the meat,\r\nand from them the maggots are hatched. It took a long time for this\r\ndemonstration by Redi to affect popular belief, and there are still\r\ncountry folk who believe in the spontaneous generation of maggots.[4]\r\n\r\n[4] See the chapter, \"Primitive Beliefs about Fatherless Progeny,\" in\r\n\"Science from an Easy Chair,\" Second Series.\r\n\r\nBut few, if any, persons of ordinary intelligence or education now\r\nbelieve that these sudden productions of living things, without regular\r\nand known parentage, take place. The spontaneous generation of large,\r\ntangible creatures having ceased to be an article of general belief,\r\nthe conviction nevertheless persisted for some time that at any rate\r\nminute microscopic living things were generated without parentage. This\r\ntheory was more difficult to test on account of the need for employing\r\nthe microscope in the inquiry, which was not brought to a high state\r\nof efficiency until the last century. By experiments similar to those\r\nof Redi, it was shown in the first half of last century by Theodor\r\nSchwann that even the minute bacteria do not appear in putrescible\r\nmaterial when those already in it are killed by boiling that material,\r\nand when the subsequent access to it of other bacteria is prevented\r\nby closing all possible entrance of air-borne particles, or insect\r\ncarriers of germs. It took another fifty years to thoroughly establish\r\nby observation and experiment the truth of Schwann's refutation of the\r\nsupposed \"spontaneous generation\" of the minutest forms of life.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the strange incapacity for making correct observation\r\nand the failure to record correctly things observed which are\r\nfrequently exhibited by the most highly placed \"men of education,\"\r\nas well as by uneducated peasants and fisher folk, we have the short\r\npaper entitled, \"A Relation concerning Barnacles,\" by Sir Robert\r\nMoray--the first president of the Royal Society of London (from 1661\r\nuntil its incorporation in 1662)--a very distinguished man, and an\r\nintimate friend of King Charles II. This paper was read to the society\r\nin 1661 and published in 1677 in vol. xii. of the \"Philosophical\r\nTransactions.\" Sir Robert relates how he found on the coast a quantity\r\nof dead barnacles attached to a piece of timber, and that in each\r\nbarnacle's shell was a bird. He writes: \"This bird in every shell\r\nthat I opened, as well the least as the biggest, I found so curiously\r\nand completely formed that there appeared nothing wanting, as to the\r\nexternal parts, for making up a perfect sea-fowl; every little part\r\nappearing so distinctly that the whole looked like a large bird seen\r\nthrough a concave or diminishing glass, colour and feature being\r\neverywhere so clear and near. The little bill like that of a goose, the\r\neyes marked, the head, neck, breast, wings, tail and feet formed, the\r\nfeathers everywhere perfectly shaped and blackish coloured, and the\r\nfeet like those of other waterfowl--_to my best remembrance_. All being\r\ndead and dry, I did not look after the inward parts of them.\" If the\r\nreader will now look at Fig. 15, C, which represents the soft parts of\r\na barnacle when the shells of one side are removed, he will see how far\r\nSir Robert Moray must have been the victim--as so many people naturally\r\nare under such circumstances--of imagination and defective memory when\r\nhe wrote this account. I have put into italics in the above quotation\r\nfrom his \"Relation\" his confession that he is writing, not with his\r\nspecimens before him, but from remembrance of them. Moreover, he tells\r\nus, with admirable candour, that the specimens were dead and dry when\r\nhe examined them! One could not desire a better justification for the\r\nmotto adopted by the Royal Society, \"Nullius in verba,\" and for the\r\nprocedure upon which in its early days the Society insisted--namely,\r\nthat at its meetings the members should \"bring in\" a specimen or an\r\nexperiment, and not occupy time by mere relations and reports of\r\nmarvels. It is necessary even at the present day to insist on such\r\ndemonstration by those who urge us to accept as true their relations of\r\nmysterious experiences with ghosts, and their \"conviction\" that they\r\nhave conversed with \"discarnate intelligences.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nMORE AS TO THE BARNACLE AND THE GOOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is clear that there was a widespread tradition known to the learned\r\nin the early centuries of the Christian era, according to which there\r\nexisted in some distant Eastern land a tree which bore buds or fruits\r\nwhich became converted into birds. Connected with this, and perhaps\r\nreally a part of it, there existed a tradition that marine \"barnacles\"\r\ngave birth to geese from within their shells, or are in some way\r\nconverted into geese. The two stories were in some localities and\r\nnarrations combined, though in others they were distinct. On the coast\r\nof Ireland the early missionaries of the Church (learned men acquainted\r\nwith the traditions of their time) identified the migratory brent goose\r\nwith the bird said to be produced by the barnacle; and elsewhere, on\r\nthe Scottish coast, the barnacles were (it was reported) found growing\r\non trees. There is no such resemblance between barnacles and brent\r\ngeese as to have suggested to the Irish monks the regular and natural\r\nconversion of one into the other. It seems most probable that the\r\nlearned churchmen knew the traditional story already before arriving\r\nin Ireland, and applied it to the barnacles and the geese which\r\nthey discovered around them. Eventually the word \"barnacle\" without\r\nqualification was applied to the geese, as we see in Gerard's account\r\ngiven in the last chapter. Is there, it may be asked, anything further\r\nknown as to such a tradition, and the place and manner of its origin?\r\nIn the absence of such knowledge, an ingenious attempt was made by my\r\nold friend, Professor Max Müller, to account for the tradition by the\r\nsimilarity of the names, which he erroneously supposed had been given\r\n_independently_ to the barnacle and to the \"Hibernian\" goose. I will\r\nrefer to this below, but now I will proceed to give the most probable\r\nsolution of the mystery as to the tradition of the tree, the goose,\r\nand the barnacle. Its discovery is not more than twenty years old, and\r\nis due to M. Frederic Houssay, a distinguished French zoologist of the\r\nEcole Normale, who published it in the \"Revue Archeologique\" in 1895.\r\nIt has not hitherto been brought to the notice of English readers, and\r\nI shall therefore give a full account of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Fanciful designs by Mykenæan artists, showing\r\nchange of the cuttle-fish (octopus or \"poulpe\") into a bull's head and\r\nother shapes.\r\n\r\na, Octopus drawn on a goblet from Crete, the arms reduced to two, the\r\neyes detached.\r\n\r\nb and c, Bull's head variations of the octopus, from designs found at\r\nKoban in the Caucasus.\r\n\r\nd, Spiral treatment of the arms of the octopus (a pose actually seen in\r\nliving specimens).\r\n\r\ne, f, Human faces painted on Cretan jars across the whole width of the\r\nneck, the design being derived from the octopus with detached eyes as\r\nin Fig. a. Such designs survive long after their origin is forgotten,\r\nas (according to M. Houssay) the legend of the barnacle and the goose\r\nsurvived two thousand years after the Mykenæan drawings assimilating\r\none to the other had been forgotten.]\r\n\r\nThe solution is as follows: The Mykenæan population of the islands of\r\nCyprus and Crete, in the period 800 to 1000 years before Christ, were\r\ngreat makers of pottery, and painted large earthernware basins and\r\nvases with a variety of decorative representations of marine life, of\r\nfishes, butterflies, birds, and trees. Some of these are to be seen in\r\nthe British Museum at Bloomsbury, where I examined them a few years\r\nago. Others have been figured by the well-known archæologists, MM.\r\nPerrot and Chipiez, in the sixth volume of their work, \"L'Ossuaire de\r\nCrète.\" M. Perrot consulted M. Houssay, in his capacity of zoologist,\r\nin regard to these Mykenæan drawings, which bear, as M. Houssay states,\r\nthe evidence of having been designed _after nature_ by one who knew\r\nthe things in life, although they are not slavishly \"copied\" from\r\nnature. These early Mykenæan painters on pottery were members of a\r\ncommunity who worshipped the great mother--\"Nature\"--as Astarte or\r\nAphrodite risen from the foam of the sea. Being sailors and fishermen,\r\nmarine life was even more familiar to them than that of the land, and\r\nthey placed little models of sea animals as votive offerings in the\r\ntemples of the great mother, and also honoured her in decorating their\r\npottery with marine creatures. The little fish, Hippocampus, called\r\nthe sea-horse, the sea-urchin, the octopus, the argonaut and its\r\nfloating cradle, the sea-anemone, and the butterfly-like Pteropod,\r\nwere subjects used by these artists for which they found terrestrial\r\ncounterparts. The sea-horse was convertible decoratively into a true\r\nhorse, with intermediate phases imagined by the artists; the sea-urchin\r\ninto a hedgehog, the sea-anemone into a flower, and the Pteropod into\r\na true butterfly. These artists loved to exercise a little fancy and\r\ningenuity. By gradual reduction in the number and size of outstanding\r\nparts--a common rule in the artistic \"schematizing\" or \"conventional\r\nsimplification\" of natural form--they converted the octopus and the\r\nargonaut, with their eight arms, into a bull's head with a pair of\r\nspiral horns (Fig. 14). In the same spirit it seems that they observed\r\nand drew the barnacle floating on timber or thrown up after a storm\r\non their shores. They detected a resemblance in the marking of its\r\nshells to the plumage of a goose, whilst in the curvature of its stalk\r\nthey saw a resemblance to the long neck of the bird. The barnacle's\r\njointed plumose legs or cirri and other details suggested points of\r\nagreement with the feathers of the bird. They brought the barnacle and\r\nthe goose together, not guided thereto by any pre-existing legend, but\r\nby a simple and not uncommon artistic desire to follow up a superficial\r\nsuggestion of similarity and to conceive of intermediate connecting\r\nforms. Some of their fanciful drawings with this purpose are shown in\r\nFigs. 15, 16, and 17. These (excepting the drawing of the barnacle\r\nlying within its opened shell) are copied from M. Houssay's paper\r\non the subject, and were taken from the work of M. Perrot on Cretan\r\npottery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--The Goose and the Barnacle.\r\n\r\nA, Drawing of a Ship's Barnacle attached to a piece of timber by its\r\n\"peduncle\" or stalk, which represents the neck of a goose, if we regard\r\nthe shell-covered region as the goose's body. From a sketch by M.\r\nFrederic Houssay published in the \"Revue Archæologique,\" January 1895.\r\n\r\nB, Copy of a drawing on an ancient Mykenæan pot found in Crete, and\r\nfigured by M. Perrot in his \"Ossuaire de Crète\" vol. vi. p. 936. It is\r\na fantastic blend of the goose and the barnacle. The barnacle's stalk\r\nis given a beak and an eye; the body of the bird corresponds to the\r\nshells of the barnacle both in shape and marking. There are no wings or\r\nlegs, but the curious single limb which I have marked pe is obviously\r\nthe same thing as that marked pe in figure C, which represents the\r\nbarnacle when cut open so as to show the structures within the shell,\r\npe is the rod-like body at the end of which the seminal duct opens.\r\nIt is seen in the drawing of the expanded barnacle (Fig. 10), lying\r\nbetween the two groups of six forked and jointed legs or \"cirri.\"\r\n\r\nC, A correct modern drawing of a ship's barnacle, with the shells of\r\none side removed so as to show the six double legs of one side, the\r\nseminal rod (pe), and the internal organs. This is what Sir Robert\r\nMoray and his mediaeval predecessors saw on opening the barnacle's\r\nshell and described as \"a young bird complete in every detail.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Copy of a series of modified geese painted\r\non an early Mykenæan pot, figured by M. Perrot. Each has two jointed\r\nappendages on the back, which suggest the wing feathers of the bird or\r\ntwo of the jointed legs (cirri) of the barnacle, which issue in life\r\nfrom this part of the barnacle's shell. The legs of the geese are very\r\nsmall and absent in the fifth. The markings on the body differ in each\r\nbird, but recall the shell of the barnacle divided into several valves\r\nmarked with parallel striations. They may also pass for the plumage of\r\nthe bird.]\r\n\r\nThe intention of the artist to fantastically insist on intermediate\r\nphases between goose and barnacle is placed beyond doubt by certain\r\ndetails. For instance, in Fig. 16, the little jointed processes on\r\nthe back of the goose marked a, correspond in position to the cirri\r\nor legs of the barnacle. They are reduced in number to two, and\r\nsimplified in form so as to pass for the tips of the wings of the\r\ngoose. The goose's own feet are represented in their natural position.\r\nThe most extraordinary piece of resemblance in detail is that given\r\nin Fig. 15, B, which is a copy of a very much \"barnaculized\" goose\r\nfrom one of these ancient dishes. What does the Mykenæan artist mean\r\nto represent by the strange single leg-like limb marked pe? When we\r\ncarefully examine the barnacle's soft body concealed by its shell, it\r\nbecomes obvious that this leg-like thing corresponds to the single\r\nstalk-like body, ending in a bunch of a few hairs which is marked pe in\r\nFig. 15, C. This last-named figure is a careful modern representation\r\nof the soft living barnacle, as seen when the shells of one side are\r\nremoved. The cylindrical body pe of Fig. 15, C, which is drawn by the\r\nMykenæan artist on an exaggerated scale in Fig. 15, B, is the external\r\nopening of the seminal duct of the barnacle. It is remarkable that the\r\nMykenæan pottery-painter had observed the soft \"fish\" of the barnacle\r\nso minutely as to select this unpaired and very peculiar-looking\r\nstructure, and represent it of exaggerated size attached in its proper\r\nposition on the barnacle-like body of a goose. This very striking\r\ntransference of a peculiar and characteristic organ of the barnacle to\r\nthe body of the goose by the artist seems not to have been noticed by\r\nM. Houssay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Two drawings on pottery of modified geese,\r\nfrom Perrot's \"Ossuaire de Crète.\" The three lines above the back of\r\nthe upper figure probably represent the legs or cirri of the barnacle,\r\nwhich are represented by two jointed appendages in the geese shown in\r\nFig. 16.]\r\n\r\nM. Houssay further points out the existence on some of the Mykenæan\r\npottery of drawings (see \"L'Ossuaire de Crète,\" by MM. Perrot and\r\nChipiez) of leaves attached to tree-like stems. These leaves (Fig.\r\n18, a, b, c) exhibit the same markings (\"venation\") which we see on\r\nthe bodies of the geese in Fig. 16, especially the middle one of the\r\nfive. The leaves (or fruits?) copied by M. Houssay from the Mykenæan\r\npottery are attached in a series to a stem--but no one, at present,\r\nhas suggested what plant it is which is represented. The corners of\r\nthe leaf or fruit to the right and left of its stalk are thrown into\r\na spiral--and the half leaf or half fruit represented in Fig. 18, b,\r\nleads us on to that drawn in Fig. 18, c, in which the spiral corner is\r\nslightly modified in curvature so as to resemble the head and neck of\r\nthe goose as drawn in Fig. 16. Though Fig. 18, c, is as yet devoid of\r\nlegs or wing feathers (compare Fig. 16, d), the black band along the\r\nbelly with the band of vertical markings above it agrees closely with\r\nthe design on the body of the middle goose of the series drawn in Fig.\r\n16. As these are associated in the decoration of the Mykenæan artists,\r\nit is fairly evident that the intention has been to manipulate the\r\ndrawing of the leaf or fruit so as to make it resemble the drawing of\r\nthe goose, whilst that in its turn is modified so as to emphasize or\r\nidealize its points of resemblance to a barnacle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Leaves from the tree, drawn on a Mykenæan pot\r\nwhich, according to M. Perrot, are fancifully designed so as to assume\r\nstep by step (a, b, c) the form of a goose. This appears either to\r\nrepresent the tree which, according to legend, produced birds as buds\r\non its branches, or to be a fanciful design which gave rise to that\r\nlegend. The artist's intention of making the leaf gradually pass into\r\nthe semblance of a goose, is strongly emphasized by the purely fanciful\r\n\"venation\" of the leaf which agrees with the equally fanciful ornament\r\nof the bodies of the geese in Fig. 16, especially the middle one of the\r\nseries.]\r\n\r\nIt is true enough that the drawings from Mykenæan pots here submitted\r\ncannot be considered as a complete demonstration that the legend of the\r\ntree-goose originated with these drawings. But it must be remembered\r\nthat we have only a small number of examples of this pottery surviving\r\nfrom a thousand years B.C. It is probable that the fanciful decorative\r\ndesign of a master artist was copied and used in the painting of\r\nhundreds of pots by mere workmen or inferior craftsmen, and that more\r\ncomplete and impressive designs showing the fanciful transformation\r\nof leaf or fruit to goose, and of goose to barnacle, existed both\r\nbefore and after the making of the particular pots and jars which\r\nhave come down to us. The supposition made by M. Houssay (which I\r\nentirely support) is that some later Levantine people--to whom these\r\ndecorated pots or copies of their decorations became known either in\r\nthe regular way of trade or as sailors' \"curios\"--were led to attempt\r\nan explanation of the significance of the pictures drawn upon them,\r\nand in accordance with a well-known and rooted tendency--interpreted\r\nthe fancies of the artist as careful representations of astonishing\r\nfact. The existence of a tree which produces buds which become birds,\r\nand of a barnacle which becomes transformed into a goose--is the\r\nmatter-of-fact interpretation of the few pictures of these animals\r\nwhich have come down to us, modern men, painted on the few pots of that\r\nremote Mykenæan industry now in our museums. It is not at all unlikely\r\nthat in the vast period of time between 1000 B.C. and 1000 A.D., the\r\nmore striking of these designs had been copied and familiarized in some\r\npart of the ancient world. It is true that we do not at present know\r\nin what part: we have not yet come across these designs of later date\r\nthan 800 B.C. The absence of the story of the tree-goose from Greek\r\nand Roman lore is striking. Neither Aristotle nor Herodotus knew of\r\nit, although it has been erroneously stated that they refer to it. Yet\r\nthe source of it was there in the Greek isles almost under their noses\r\n(if one may speak of the noses of such splendid and worshipful men of\r\nold) in the artistic work--otherwise not unknown to the Greeks--of a\r\ncivilization which preceded their own by hundreds of years. There is\r\nother and ample evidence--as for instance that of the representation of\r\nthe \"flying gallop\" (see \"Science from an Easy Chair,\" Second Series,\r\npp. 57 and 63), showing that Mykenæan art had little or no direct\r\neffect on the Hellenes, although the reputation of the skill of the old\r\nrace in metal work came through many generations to them. Mykenæan art\r\nseems to have migrated with Mykenæan settlers to the remote region of\r\nthe Caucasus. In the necropolis of Koban and other remote settlements,\r\nMykenæan designs in bronze and gold--including the horse in flying\r\ngallop and octopods transformed to bull's heads--have been found and\r\npictured (Ernest Chantre, \"Recherches anthropologique dans Caucase,\"\r\n4 vols.: Paris, 1886). They are believed to date from 500 B.C. It is\r\npossible that in such remote regions or in some of the Greek islands\r\nthe pictures of the tree-goose and the barnacle may have survived until\r\nthe new dispensation--that is, until the days of the Byzantine Empire.\r\nOnce we can trace either the pictures or the legend up to that point,\r\nthere is no difficulty about admitting the radiation of the wonderful\r\nstory from that centre to the Jews of the Kabbalah, to Arabic writers,\r\nand so to the learned men of the Christian Church and the seats of\r\nlearning throughout Europe and a great part of Asia.\r\n\r\nOf the history of the legend during two thousand years we have no\r\nactual knowledge. It remains for investigation. But undoubtedly these\r\nMykenæan pottery paintings remove the origin of the story to a period\r\ntwo thousand years older than that of the Irish monks.\r\n\r\nOne additional fact I may mention as to the existence of the goose\r\nand barnacle legend in the East. I am informed that in Java there is,\r\naccording to \"native\" story, a shell-fish the animal of which becomes\r\ntransformed into a bird--said to be a kind of snipe--and flies from\r\nthe shell. I have been shown the shell by a Dutch lady who has lived\r\nin Java. It is a large fresh-water mussel, one of the Unionidæ. I have\r\nfailed to obtain, after inquiry, any further information as to the\r\nprevalence or origin of this story in Java, and hope that some one who\r\nreads this page may be able to help me.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the story of the goose and the barnacle, the explanation\r\nof the myth given by Prof. Max Müller in his lectures on the science of\r\nlanguage nearly fifty years ago, should be cited. It is an excellent\r\nexample of the misuse of hypothesis in investigation, and the attempt\r\nto explain something which we cannot get at and examine by making a\r\nsupposition which it is even more difficult to examine and test.\r\n\r\nMax Müller made use of the observation--a perfectly true and\r\ninteresting one--that a whole people or folk will be led to a wrong\r\nconclusion, or to a belief in some strange and marvellous occurrence,\r\nby the misunderstanding of a single word, attributing to that word\r\na sense which now fits the sound, but one quite different from that\r\nwith which the word was originally used in the tradition or history\r\nconcerned. Words are, in fact, misinterpreted after a lapse of time, or\r\nwhen imported from distant lands, just as we have seen that pictures\r\nand sculpture often have been. For instance, Richard Whittington, who\r\nwas Lord Mayor of London in 1398 and other later years, did business\r\nin French goods, which was spoken of in the city as \"achat,\" and\r\npronounced \"akat.\" Hence in later centuries, when the prevalence of\r\nNorman French was forgotten, it was stated (in a play produced in\r\n1605) that Whittington owed his fortune to \"a cat,\" and the story\r\nof the wonderful cat and its deeds was built up \"line upon line\" or\r\n\"lie upon lie.\" Max Müller suggested that the story of the barnacle\r\nand the goose could be similarly explained. The brant or brent goose\r\nwhich frequents the Irish shore was, he supposes, called \"berniculus\"\r\nby the Latin-speaking clergy as a diminutive of Hibernicus, meaning\r\n\"Irish.\" There is absolutely no evidence to support this. Max Müller\r\nsupposes that Hibernicus became \"Hiberniculus,\" and then dropping the\r\nfirst syllable became \"Berniculus,\" and that this word was applied to\r\nthe \"Irish goose.\" It might have been, but there is nothing to show\r\nthat it was. Meanwhile the ship's barnacle and other sea-shells were\r\ncalled in the Celtic tongue \"barnagh,\" \"berniche,\" or \"bernak,\" and the\r\nhermit-crab is still called on the Breton coast, \"Bernard l'hermite,\"\r\na modification of \"bernak l'hermite.\" There is no doubt that the word\r\n\"barnacle\" as applied to the stalked shell-fish growing on ships'\r\nbottoms is a diminutive of the Celtic word \"bernak,\" or \"barnak.\" It\r\nbecame in Latin \"barnacus,\" and then the diminutive \"barnaculus,\" and\r\nso \"barnacle\" was used for the little stalked shell-fish encrusting old\r\ntimber. According to Max Müller, later generations thus found the two\r\nanimals, goose and shell-fish, called by the same name, \"bernikle,\" or\r\n\"barnacle.\" \"Why?\" they would ask: and then (he supposes) they would\r\ncompare the two and detect points of resemblance, until at last a very\r\ndevout and astute monk had the happy thought of declaring that the\r\nHibernian goose was called \"berniculus,\" or \"barnak-goose,\" _because_\r\nit did not breed from eggs as other birds do, but is hatched out of\r\nthe shell of the shell-fish, also very naturally and rightly called\r\n\"berniculus,\" or barnak, as any one may see by carefully examining the\r\nfish contained in the shell of the barnacle or little stalked \"barnak,\"\r\nwhich has the complete form of a bird. Since, however, it is not a\r\nbird, but a fish in nature and origin, this holy man declared that\r\nthe \"berniculus,\" or \"barnacle-goose,\" may be eaten on fast days. Max\r\nMüller's explanation of the origin of the story is too adventurous in\r\nits unsupported assumption that the particular goose associated with\r\nthe story was peculiarly Irish, or that, in fact, any kind of goose\r\nwas so. He also put aside the evidence of Father Damien (earlier than\r\nthe Irish story of Giraldus) referring the goose-tree to an island in\r\nthe Indies, and the report cited in the Oriental book the \"Zohar.\"\r\nHowever plausible Max Müller's theory may have appeared, it absolutely\r\ncrumbles and disappears in the presence of the Mykenæan pictures of\r\n\"barnaculized\" geese, and trees budding birds--two thousand years older\r\nthan the Irish record, and nearly three thousand years earlier than the\r\nessay of the charming and persuasive professor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSEA-SHELLS ON THE SEASHORE\r\n\r\n\r\nANY hard coat or covering enclosing a softer material is called a\r\n\"shell\"--thus we speak of an egg-shell, a nut-shell, a bomb-shell,\r\nand the shell of a lobster. But there is a special and restricted use\r\nof the word to indicate as \"true\" and \"real\" shells the beautiful\r\ncoverings made for their protection by the soft, mobile animals called\r\nMolluscs. These animals expand and contract first this and then that\r\nregion of the body by squeezing the blood within it (by means of the\r\nsoft muscular coat of the sac-like body) into one part or another\r\nin turn. There is not enough blood to distend the whole animal, and\r\naccordingly one part is swollen out and protrudes from the shell,\r\nwhilst another shrinks as the blood is propelled here or there by the\r\ncompressing muscular coat. These creatures are the Molluscs, a name\r\nwhich has come into general use (and has even served as the title for\r\na stage-play), as well as being the zoologist's title for the great\r\ndivision of animals which they constitute.\r\n\r\nThey are sometimes called \"shell-fish,\" but this is no good as a\r\ndistinctive name--since it is applied in the fish-trade to lobsters,\r\ncrabs, and shrimps as well as to Molluscs. Lobsters, crabs, and shrimps\r\nare Crustacea, and totally different in their architecture and their\r\nmechanism from Molluscs. Familiar examples of Molluscs are the oyster,\r\nthe mussel, the various \"clams,\" and, again, the snails, periwinkles,\r\nwhelks, and limpets. It is the shells of these animals which are\r\n\"true\" shells in the sense in which the word is used by \"collectors\"\r\nof shells, and in the sense in which we speak of \"the shells of the\r\nseashore.\" These shells are usually very hard, solid things, made up\r\nof layers of lime-salts and horny matter mixed, and they remain for a\r\nlong time undestroyed, washed about by the currents of the sea, and\r\nthrown up on to the beach, after the soft, oozy creature which formed\r\nthem--chemically secreted them on its soft skin--has decomposed and\r\ndisappeared. They are readily distinguished into two sorts--(1) those\r\nwhich are formed in pairs, or \"bivalves,\" each member of the pair being\r\ncalled a \"valve\"; and (2) those which are single, or \"univalves,\" often\r\nspirally twisted, as are those of snails and whelks, but sometimes\r\ncap-like or basin-like, as are the shells of the limpets. There is not\r\nso great a difference between bivalve and univalve shells as there\r\nseems to be at first sight. For if you examine the pair of shells of\r\na mussel or a clam when they are quite fresh, you will find that the\r\nvalves are joined together by a horny, elastic substance, and are, in\r\nfact, only one horny shell, or covering, which is made hard by lime\r\ndeposited on the right and on the left, as two plates or valves, but\r\nis left soft and uncalcified along a line where these two valves meet,\r\nso as to allow them to move and gape, as it were, on an elastic hinge.\r\nIt is the fact that the two valves of the shell of the bivalve, lying\r\nright and left on its body, correspond to the single shell of the snail\r\nor limpet, which differs from the bivalve-shell in not being divided\r\nalong the back by a soft part into right and left pieces. That there\r\nis this real agreement between bivalve and univalve molluscs is quite\r\nevident when we examine the soft animal which forms the shell and is\r\nprotected by it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Some British Marine Bivalve Molluscs.\r\n\r\na, The smaller Piddock, Pholas parva, which bores into chalk, clay, and\r\nhard rock.

The shells which are accumulated as shell-beaches\r\nhave come from animals which lived in quantity at depths of ten or\r\ntwenty fathoms, whence they can be brought up alive by the dredge.\r\nThere are, however, certain bivalves and certain univalves which are\r\ncommonly to be found in the living state between tide-marks. You will\r\nnot find the oyster there on our own coast, but in Australia they have\r\npicnic parties where every guest provides himself with a hammer and a\r\nbottle of vinegar and a pepper-pot, and at low tide proceeds to chip\r\nthe oysters off the rocks on which they grow tightly fixed, and to eat\r\nthem \"right away\" before they have time to lose their good temper and\r\nsweetness! In Jamaica they show you oysters apparently growing on trees\r\nhigh up in the air, but they are dead, having attached themselves to\r\nthe branches of a young tree which dipped into the water. Once fixed\r\nthere, they were unable to move as the tree grew and carried them up\r\nwith its branches above the sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe only bivalve at all common and visible to the eye between\r\ntide-marks is the common or edible sea-mussel, which is attached\r\nin purple clusters to the rocks (as in North Cornwall), or forms a\r\nwide-spreading pavement, called a \"scalp,\" of as much as an acre in\r\nextent, on which thousands of mussels lie side by side. But by digging\r\nin the sand and mud between tides there are other living bivalves to be\r\nfound, which burrow more or less deeply. The razor-shell (Fig. 19, b)\r\nis one of these (see p. 80). Often (as at Teignmouth and Barmouth) we\r\nfind \"cockles\" buried in the sand, and those delicate, smooth bivalves\r\nnot an inch long, white outside and purple within, which are made into\r\nsoup at Naples and are called \"vongoli,\" but have no English name.\r\nOther \"clams\" (Tapes, which is eaten in France, even in Paris, and Mya,\r\nand Scrobicularia which lives in black mud) may be dug up, but they are\r\ndevoid of English names because we do not eat them; hence I have to\r\nspeak of them by their Latin scientific names. As to univalves, there\r\nare three which are found almost everywhere on our coasts where there\r\nare rocks, namely, the periwinkles (one species of which actually\r\nlives above high tide-mark), the limpet, and the dog-whelk. A small\r\nspecies of top-shell or trochus is also very common, and so is the\r\nchiton, or armadillo-shell, which, though really the most primitive\r\nand nearest representative of the ancestors of all univalve molluscs,\r\nyet has its own shell of a very peculiar character (sometimes with\r\nvery minute eyes--true eyes--dotted about on it), and always divided\r\ntransversely to its length (not right and left) into eight separate\r\npieces, which, indeed, seem to be really separate, independent little\r\nshells, corresponding to eight segments like the segments of a shrimp\r\nor an earth-worm.\r\n\r\nLet us now compare the soft animal of one of the bivalves--say\r\nthe common cockle--with the soft animal to which a univalve shell\r\nbelongs--say the limpet. They can be kept alive and watched in a\r\nfinger-glass of sea-water, and can be removed from their shells and\r\nexamined more closely--by killing them by dipping them for half a\r\nminute into very hot (not boiling) water. Both these molluscs--like\r\nall others--adhere tightly at one place to the shell. They cannot be\r\nremoved from it alive, and make a new shell or creep back into the old\r\none, as can some worms (_e.g._ the serpula) and other creatures which\r\nform a hard shell to live in. Certain muscles of the soft mollusc\r\nare so closely fixed to the shell that they must be torn in order to\r\nseparate it. These muscles draw the two valves of the bivalve together,\r\nand shut it tight. You can verify this whenever the oyster-man \"opens\"\r\nan oyster for you. When at rest the shells gape, being kept open by the\r\nhorny, elastic hinge-piece. Some bivalves (for instance, the common\r\nscallop, or pilgrim's shell, which can often be dredged in shallow\r\nwater, and of which a large kind is sold in the London fish shops)\r\nactually swim in the sea-water by aid of this mechanism, the shells\r\nopening by elasticity and being closed by the muscle joining one to the\r\nother, at rapid intervals, flapping like the wings of a butterfly.\r\n\r\nIn the univalves the attachment of the muscle to the shell gives a\r\nfixed point for all the movements of the animal. The limpet has a\r\nwell-marked head and neck--a pair of sensitive tentacles, and a small\r\npair of dark-coloured eyes. The mouth is at the end of a sort of short\r\nsnout. Just within the mouth, and capable of being pushed forwards to\r\nthe level of the lips, is a most extraordinary rasp. It consists of a\r\nlong ribbon, beset with fine horny teeth--very sharp and complicated in\r\npattern. The ribbon extends far back into the body, and is worn away by\r\nconstant use at the orifice of the mouth. It grows forward, like one\r\nof our finger-nails, as it wears out, and a new, unworn portion takes\r\nthe place of that worn away. It is constantly in use to rasp and bring\r\ninto the mouth the particles of the seaweed on which the limpet feeds.\r\nIt is easy to remove this rasping ribbon with a needle or pen-knife,\r\nand examine it with a microscope. Every one of the hundreds of kinds of\r\nunivalve molluscs has this ribbon-rasp, and its teeth are of different\r\npatterns in the various kinds. It is worked by very powerful little\r\nmuscles, backwards and forwards, and is strong enough in the whelks to\r\nbore a round hole into other shells (for instance, that of the oyster),\r\nwhen the whelk proceeds to eat the soft animal, whose protecting shell\r\nhas been thus penetrated. Some of the large marine snails produce a\r\npoisonous secretion from the mouth, which renders their attack with\r\nthe ribbon-rasp all the more deadly to other marine creatures. The\r\ncuttle-fishes and octopods, which are molluscs too, possess, like the\r\nunivalve limpets, snails, and whelks, this terrible ribbon-rasp in\r\nthe mouth. It is an indication of a common parentage or ancestral\r\nrelationship in the forms which possess it.\r\n\r\nThe cockle (Fig. 19, d), to which we now turn, has not got a\r\nribbon-rasp, nor anything of the kind. It has a mouth with four\r\nflapper-like lips, but no projecting head, no eyes, no biting\r\nmechanism, nor have any of the bivalves, excepting a few which like the\r\nscallop have a series of eyes on the edge of the soft mantle or flap\r\nwhich lines the shell. This constitutes a greater difference between\r\nbivalves and the univalves than does the shape of the shell. They are\r\na very quiescent, peaceful lot, feeding on microscopic floating plants\r\n(diatoms and such), which are drawn to the mouth by currents of water\r\nset going by millions of vibrating hairs arranged on four soft plates\r\nhanging under the protecting arch of the shell, and called in the\r\noyster--in which bivalve most people know them--the \"beard.\"\r\n\r\nThe limpet adheres to rocks by a great disk-like mass of muscle, which\r\nis called \"the foot.\" It is really the whole ventral surface, and it\r\ncan loosen its hold, and, by curious ripples of contraction, cause\r\nthe animal to creep or glide over the rock. At low tide the limpet is\r\nexposed to the air, and remains motionless, but when the tide is up\r\nit makes a small excursion in search of food, never going more than a\r\nfoot or two from the spot which it has chosen, and returning to it,\r\nso that in the course of time it actually wears away a sort of cup or\r\ndepression at this spot--if the rock is not of exceptional hardness.\r\nThe word \"foot\" is applied to the ventral disk-like surface of the\r\nlimpet, because in many univalves this region becomes drawn out, and\r\nis connected by a comparatively narrow and nipped-in stalk or pillar\r\nwith the rest of the animal. This occurs in the univalves which have\r\nlarge spiral shells, into which the whole of the soft animal can be\r\ndeeply withdrawn, which is not the case with the limpet. You may find\r\non the shore at Torquay a sea-snail (Natica), in which the animal is\r\nquite invisible, drawn far up into the shell. Place this in sea-water\r\nand watch it. Soft semi-transparent lobes begin to issue from the\r\nmouth of the shell, part of the soft distensible foot appears swelling\r\nout and growing bigger and bigger, and soft folds spread out from the\r\nmouth of the shell, and gently creep over it, and completely envelop\r\nit; the foot begins to grip the bottom of the vessel, and the animal\r\n\"crawls.\" At last, swelling out from the other folds of soft but tense\r\n\"molluscan\" substance, the head and its tentacles emerge. Touch the\r\nanimal and it shrinks rapidly, disappearing into the shell.\r\n\r\nIt used to be thought (about twenty-five years ago) that the molluscs\r\nexpand their bodies in this manner by taking water, through definite\r\napertures provided with valves, into their blood, and that, having\r\nthus swelled themselves out, they could shrink and reduce themselves\r\nby pouring out again the in-taken water. The behaviour of some other\r\nmarine animals, namely the sea-anemones, which really do act in this\r\nway, made this explanation of the swelling and shrinking of molluscs\r\nseem probable. It was also known that the star-fishes and sea-urchins\r\nactually do take in the sea-water into a system of vessels connected\r\nwith their wonderful sucker-bearing tentacles. But it turned out on\r\nclose examination that the molluscs do not take in or shed out water in\r\nthis way. A hole, which was thought to let in water into the blood of\r\nsea-snails, was shown to be only the opening of a great slime-gland.\r\nIn the case of some bivalves which have red-blood corpuscles, I showed\r\nthat the blood is never made paler, nor are the red corpuscles shed\r\nduring the great distensions and contractions of the body. Measurements\r\nwere made to determine the removal of water from a glass jar by an\r\nexpanding sea-snail, and it was found that none is removed or taken\r\nup; in fact, the whole of what is very often an astonishingly large\r\nand bulky distension of the foot, or of lobes of the body, and the\r\nsubsequent rapid shrinking of the same parts, depend entirely on the\r\nblood being injected from the rest of the body into the swelling part,\r\nand squeezed from it into the depleted region when the swollen part\r\nshrinks again. The firm, opaque shell hides from view the change of\r\nshape of the concealed body, and we see only the distended foot or\r\nother lobes which project from the shell.\r\n\r\nThe cockle has a \"foot\" of a very curious scythe-like shape, usually\r\ncarried bent up between the two valves of the shell. Those who\r\nrightly like to confirm statements about unfamiliar animals can do\r\nso by buying a cockle or two at the fishmonger's. Some bivalves (the\r\nNoah's-ark-shell, called \"Arca,\" and a few others) have a great flat\r\nfoot, like that of the univalves, and crawl about on it. But in most\r\nbivalves it is curiously elongated and modified, for the purpose of\r\nburrowing into sand by vigorous strokes, and in some it is suppressed\r\naltogether, as in the oyster. The cockle is remarkable for the fact\r\nthat when placed on a board or a rock it will give such a vigorous kick\r\nwith its bent foot as to throw itself up a yard or so into the air. A\r\nnaturalist (Stutchbury) dredging in Port Jackson, Australia, many years\r\nago was overjoyed at discovering in his net three specimens of a very\r\npeculiar kind of cockle (Trigonia), which was till then only known in\r\nthe fossil state from the oolite strata of Europe. He placed the three\r\nnovelties on the seat of his boat, and was looking at other things\r\nwhen he heard a click-like sound, then another. He turned his head\r\nand saw that two of his newly-discovered \"living fossils\" had jumped\r\noverboard, and had the pleasure of seeing the third perform the same\r\nfeat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSAND-HOPPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEREVER there is a sandy seashore with here and there masses of\r\ndead seaweed and corallines thrown up by the waves, you will find\r\nsand-hoppers feeding on the debris. They are crustaceans, like crabs,\r\nshrimps, and barnacles, but in general aspect resemble enormous\r\nfleas. I hope that this comparison will not enable any reader at\r\nonce to picture the less familiar by the more familiar. A good-sized\r\nsand-hopper is about half an inch long, and jumps not by means of a\r\nspecially large pair of legs as the flea does, but by the stroke of\r\nthe hind body, the jointed rings of which are carried curled downwards\r\nand ready to give a sudden blow. The sand-hopper (Fig. 20, a) has some\r\nof the rings or segments of the mid-body distinct, and not fused with\r\nthose of the head or overhung by a great shield as in the lobster,\r\ncrab, and shrimp. His walking legs and jaw-legs are also not quite\r\nof the same shape, though similar to those of a lobster, and his two\r\nlittle black eyes are not mounted on stalks, but are flush with the\r\nsurface of the head. There are two quite distinct kinds of sand-hopper\r\nwhich live in crowds together on our sandy shores. They are not very\r\ndifferent, but still are distinguished by naturalists from one another;\r\none is called Talitrus (Fig. 20, a), the other Orchestia (Fig. 20, b).\r\nThey are very similar in appearance and structure to a fresh-water\r\ncreature common in weedy streams, which has no English name (except\r\nthe general one of \"fresh-water shrimp\"), and is called by naturalists\r\nGammarus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--a, Talitrus locusta, b, Orchestia littorea,\r\nthe two common kinds of \"sand-hopper.\" Of the natural size. c, A kind\r\nof small lobster which burrows in the sand, Callianassa subterranea.\r\nAbout two-thirds the natural size, linear.]\r\n\r\nIn the open sea there are many hundreds of kinds of small crustaceans\r\nresembling the sand-hoppers in their compressed (not flattened) shape\r\nof body and in the details of their legs and the grouping of the joints\r\nof the body. Many of the smallest crustaceans which swarm in the\r\nsurface waters of the sea and form part of that floating population,\r\nmostly of small transparent or iridescent and blue creatures, which\r\nwe call the \"plankton,\" or \"surface-floating\" population, and may be\r\ngathered by towing a very fine net behind a boat on a quiet day, can\r\nproduce flashes of light which are vivid enough when seen at night.\r\nThey contribute, together with jelly-fish and the teeming millions of\r\nminute bladder-like Noctiluca, and other unicellular animalcules, to\r\nproduce that wonderful display seen from time to time on our coasts,\r\nand called \"the phosphorescence of the sea.\" These minute crustaceans\r\nproduce flashes of light by suddenly squeezing from pits or glands in\r\nthe skin a secretion which is chemically acted on (probably oxidized)\r\nby the sea-water, the chemical action setting up light-vibrations, but\r\nnot the usual excess of heat-vibrations to which we are accustomed when\r\nlight accompanies ordinary \"burning\" or \"combustion.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--A Phosphorescent Shrimp (Euphausia pellucida).\r\nThe lamp-like phosphorescent organs are numbered 1 to 6. There is\r\nanother on the outer edge of the stalked eye, making seven in all on\r\neach side of the animal. _g_, points to the hindermost gill, enlarged.]\r\n\r\nOther crustaceans of several kinds, of an inch and more in\r\nlength--transparent, delicate creatures, resembling small prawns\r\nin appearance--also produce light. Some of them are known by names\r\nreferring to this fact, such as Lucifer (light-bearer) and Nyctiphanes\r\n(night-shiner). They possess special lantern-like knobs scattered\r\nabout on the body, which have transparent lenses, and resemble small\r\nbull's-eye lanterns. Some have a row of seven lanterns on each side\r\nof the body (Fig. 21), but one kind has as many as 150 dotted about.\r\nThese lanterns were only a few years ago thought to be eyes, and their\r\nelaborate microscopic structure was described as that of an eye. Of\r\ncourse, this was due to the fact that dead preserved specimens were\r\nstudied, and not the living animal. Some twenty years ago I witnessed\r\na most impressive exhibition of these phosphorescent shrimps at the\r\nhouse of my friend Sir John Murray, of the \"Challenger,\" at Millport,\r\non the Clyde. He had obtained them (the kind called Nyctiphanes) in\r\ngreat quantities at a depth of ninety fathoms in the great Scotch\r\nfiord, and amongst other curious facts about them had shown that they\r\nenter Loch Fyne in vast numbers, and are the special nourishment of the\r\ncelebrated Loch Fyne herrings. It had been noticed that the intestine\r\nof the plump, well-fed herrings is full of a deep-black substance, and\r\nSir John Murray showed that this was the black, indigestible pigment\r\nof the eyes of the hundreds of phosphorescent shrimps swallowed by\r\nthese favoured fish, which owe their fine quality to their special\r\nopportunity for feeding in the depths of the loch on the exceptionally\r\nabundant and nutritious light-producing crustaceans! At night my friend\r\nshowed me a large glass vessel holding four or five gallons, in which\r\nwere a hundred or so of the phosphorescent shrimps swimming around. We\r\nturned out the lamps of the room, and all was dark. Then a gentle tap\r\nwas given to the jar, and each little crustacean lit up, as though by\r\norder, a row of seven minute lamps on each side of its body, swimming\r\nalong meanwhile, and reminding one of a passenger steamer, as seen from\r\nthe shore, as it glides along at night with its lights showing through\r\na row of cabin windows. The shrimps' lights shone steadily for a minute\r\nor so, then ceased, and had to be lit up again by again signalling\r\ntheir owners by knocking on the glass. These little lamps, with their\r\nbull's-eye lenses, are far more elaborate structures than the glands\r\nwhich in other cases cause a flash by discharging a luminous secretion\r\ninto the water. They are even more elaborate than the internal\r\npermanent phosphorescent structure of the glow-worm (an insect, not a\r\ncrustacean), which has no condensing lens.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned these phosphorescent organs of small and smallest\r\ncrustaceans because not many years ago a French naturalist, my friend\r\nProfessor Giard, found that many of the sand-hoppers on the great sandy\r\nshore near Boulogne are phosphorescent. A year or two later I found\r\nthem myself on the shore above tide-mark at Ouistreham (Westerham),\r\nnear Caen, where they had actually been mistaken for glow-worms! It was\r\neasy at night to pick up a dozen phosphorescent sand-hoppers during\r\na stroll of five or ten minutes on the sands. Yet I have never seen\r\nthem nor heard of their being seen on the English coast, and one of\r\nthe results which I hope for in mentioning them here is that some of\r\nmy readers will discover them on British sands and let me know. The\r\nremarkable fact about the luminous sand-hoppers is that they have no\r\napparatus for producing light, and, as a matter of fact, do not produce\r\nit! Their luminosity is a disease, and is due (as was shown by that\r\nmuch-beloved teacher and discoverer the late Professor Giard) to the\r\ninfection of their blood by a bacillus. Hence it is only here and there\r\nthat you see the brilliant greenish ball of light on the sand due to a\r\nphosphorescent sand-hopper. And when you pick it up you find that the\r\npoor little thing is quite feeble and unable to hop. Examine its blood\r\nunder the microscope and you find it teeming with excessively minute\r\nparasitic rods like those which cause the phosphorescence of dead fish,\r\nof stale bones, and occasionally of butcher's meat. Similar bacilli may\r\nbe obtained by cultivation from any sea-water, and in such abundance\r\nthat a room can be lit up by a bottleful of the cultivation. Perhaps\r\nall the light-producing bacteria or bacilli are only varieties of one\r\nspecies--perhaps they are distinct species. Whether a species or a\r\nvariety, that which gets into the blood of the sand-hopper and gives\r\nit the luminosity of a glow-worm, inevitably and rapidly causes its\r\ndeath--a severe price to pay for brief nocturnal effulgence. Some of\r\nthe germs can be removed on a needle's point from the dead sand-hopper\r\nand introduced by the most delicate puncture into a healthy sand-hopper\r\nor into a young crab, with the result that they too become illuminated,\r\nthe bacillus multiplying within them. Being thus morbidly illuminated\r\nand having astonished the crustacean, not to say the human world, by\r\ntheir alarming brilliance, they quickly perish: a little history which\r\nmay be read as a parable. The sand-hoppers give the disease to one\r\nanother. It is, of course, a merely non-significant thing that the\r\nbacillus happens to set up light vibrations. Its chemical activity is\r\nconcerned with its nourishment and growth, and in the course of these\r\nprocesses it not only produces light but poisonous by-products which\r\nkill its host. Some day we may get an \"immune\" race of sand-hoppers\r\nwho will acquire the illuminating bacillus and defy its poison. Then\r\nwe shall have a permanent and happy breed of brilliant sand-hoppers\r\nilluminating the dark places of the seashore.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that some of the disease-producing bacilli (bacteria,\r\ncocci, etc.) which multiply in man's blood and tissues should also\r\nproduce light vibrations, and if one could be found that would render\r\nthe blood luminous, whilst not producing much pain or _malaise_, no\r\ndoubt some excuse would be found for its use as a fashionable toilet\r\nnovelty. Cases are on record of luminosity of the surface of the body\r\nand its secretions being developed during serious illness by human\r\nbeings, especially in acute phthisis; but these ancient records need\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\r\nLuminous bacilli or bacteria only give out light when free oxygen is\r\nin the water or liquid inhabited by them. A chemical combination of\r\nthe oxygen with substances in the bacteria is the necessary condition\r\nof their evolution of light. When frozen, these bacteria cease to be\r\nluminous--the chemical combination cannot take place when the substance\r\nof the bacterium is frozen solid and maintained in that condition; the\r\nliquid condition is a necessary condition for these changes. These\r\nluminous bacteria have been used recently by Sir James Dewar in the\r\nFaraday Laboratory of the Royal Institution (where Sir James has shown\r\nthem to me), for the purpose of investigating the action of intense\r\ncold on living matter. Although their luminous response to oxygen\r\nis arrested when they are frozen, yet immediately on allowing the\r\ntemperature to rise above freezing-point the response of the living\r\nmatter to oxidation recommences, and a luminous glow is seen. Hence\r\nwe have in this glow a ready means of answering the question, \"Does\r\nextreme cold, of long duration, destroy the simplest living matter?\"\r\nSir James Dewar has exposed a film of these bacteria to the extremest\r\ndegree of cold as yet obtained in the laboratory, that at which\r\nhydrogen gas is solidified, and he has kept them in this, or nearly\r\nthis, degree of cold for several months. Yet immediately on \"thawing\"\r\nthe luminous glow was visible in the dark, showing that the bacteria\r\nwere still alive. Curiously enough, whilst all chemical action in\r\nliving matter can be thus arrested by extreme cold, and yet resumed\r\non rise of temperature and restoration to the liquid condition, so\r\nthat the old phrase and the conception of \"suspended animation\" are\r\njustified--yet there is one widely-distributed form of activity, the\r\neffect of which the bacteria, even when hard frozen, cannot resist,\r\nnamely, that of the blue and ultra-blue rays of light. These rays, if\r\nallowed to fall on the hardest frozen bacillus, get at its chemical\r\nstructure, shake it to pieces, destroy it. Hence Sir James Dewar argues\r\nthat, whilst it would appear that the extreme cold of space would\r\nnot kill a minute living germ, and prevent it passing from planet to\r\nplanet, or from remotest space to our earth, yet one thing which is\r\nmore abundant in space than within the shell of our atmosphere is\r\nabsolutely destructive to such minute particles of living matter,\r\neven when hard-frozen, and that is intense light, the ultra-visible\r\nvibrations of smallest wave-length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A dance on the seashore: a sketch by Edward Forbes\r\n(1852).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA SWISS INTERLUDE\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the hot summer of 1911 I escaped from London in September and\r\nmade straight for Interlaken. Thence I was \"wafted\" by the electric\r\nrailway to the \"Schynige Platte\"--a wonderful hill-side, 4500 feet\r\nabove the \"Bödeli,\" the flat meadowland in which Interlaken is placed.\r\nAt the Schynige Platte we are separated to the south from the Jungfrau\r\nand the great Oberland range of mountains only by a deep rift in\r\nwhich rushes the \"Black Lütschine,\" coming down from Grindelwald to\r\njoin its \"white\" brother-torrent close beneath us at Zweilütschinen.\r\nTo reach the \"Platte\" we creep in our train up the northern side\r\nof the mountain--one of whose peaks is known by the curious name\r\n\"Gummihorn\"--for more than an hour without a glimpse of what is on\r\nthe other side. Then, when we are 6000 feet above sea-level, we enter\r\na short tunnel in the shoulder of the mountain, and all is dark.\r\nWhen the train emerges every one in it gasps. You hear a cry from\r\nevery mouth--for the scene is astounding! Coming through that tunnel\r\nwe have stolen surreptitiously upon a band of gigantic snow-white\r\nbrethren--the Wetterhörner, the Schreckhörner, the Eiger, the Mönch,\r\nthe Jungfrau, the Mittaghorn, the Breithorn, and the Tschingelhorn.\r\nThere they are--lying close to us, unaware of our approach--naked and\r\nunashamed, glistening in the sunlight, variously stretched in their\r\nimmense repose. One feels on seeing them thus free from every scrap of\r\ncloud and clothing as though one had intruded upon a glorious company\r\nof titanic beings innocently sunning themselves in perfect nudity. It\r\nis with the sense that humble apologies for the intrusion are due to\r\nthem, and will be graciously accepted because we hold them in such\r\nprofound admiration and reverence, that we venture, little by little,\r\nto let our eyes dwell on their wondrous beauty. There are moments, it\r\nmust be confessed, when we feel a qualm of modesty and are unwilling\r\nto take advantage of our rare chance--moments when we should not be\r\nsurprised if one of the giants were to hurl a command at us--in terms\r\nof thunder and avalanche--ordering us at once to retire to the other\r\nside of the Gummihorn and leave them to their rightful privacy. There\r\nis no great view of snow mountains at close range--not even that from\r\nthe Gornergrat--which is at once so fine and so easily accessible.\r\n\r\nIn the following year I went early in June in search of another Alpine\r\ndelight, the spring flowers--not those of the highest \"downs\" and\r\nsheltering rocks 8000 or 9000 feet above sea-level, but those of the\r\nhigher meadows, where the pine forests are beginning to thin out, and\r\nrich crops are cut before July by the skilful workers of the great\r\nSwiss industry, that of cow-herding and the production of cheese. It is\r\ndifficult to define properly the term \"Alpine\" as applied to flowers.\r\nIt is now used by horticulturists very generally for those exquisite\r\nsmall plants, the Saxifrages, Androsacæ, Gentians, etc., which grow\r\nin the highest regions to which plant-life extends--regions which are\r\noften covered by the winter's snow until June, and even late into that\r\nmonth. Some of these plants (as, for instance, the Soldanellas--those\r\nlittle lilac-coloured flowers like pendent foolscaps which are allied\r\nto our primrose--and the crocus and the butterbur (Petasites)) actually\r\nblossom beneath the snow and push their open flowers through it to the\r\nsunlight. Others of these \"higher Alpines\" have a peculiar mode of\r\ngrowth related to their special conditions of life. Their stems are\r\nvery short and their foliage closely set, so that they form compact\r\ntufts or cushions, on which their short-stalked brilliant little\r\nflowers are dotted. The fact is they have not time in the short summer\r\nof these high regions to grow long stems. Their flowers are produced\r\non low-lying parts of the plant, which carry small and abundant green\r\nleaves, but never send up long leaf-bearing stems. Not only do they\r\nthus do quickly, and without needless upward growth, what they have\r\nto do--namely, expose green leaves to the sunlight for nutrition and\r\ntheir flowers to the fertilizing visits of insects so as to ripen their\r\nreproductive seeds--but they benefit by keeping close to the warmth of\r\nthe ground, which is heated by the strong sunshine, and is three and a\r\nhalf degrees higher in temperature than the cold moist air. In similar\r\npositions in low-lying regions the difference between the temperature\r\nof the air and that of the surface of the ground is not as much as one\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThe Alpine meadows do not occur above the height of 5000 to 6000 feet,\r\nand are bordered by pine woods, in which are many beautiful plants\r\nnot to be found at all or not in such profusion in the lower valleys.\r\nBoth the meadows and woods of the Alpine heights graduate into those\r\nof lower level, and it is difficult to draw the line and say these\r\nflowers should be, and these should not be, called \"Alpines.\" Many\r\nrock-loving plants allied to those found at great heights flourish in\r\ncomparatively low-lying regions, where the necessary rocky character\r\nexists. The flowers of the high Alpine meadows are not the rock-lovers,\r\nthe inhabitants of a surface formed by fragments of broken rock, to\r\nwhich the name \"Alpine\" is often limited. The meadow plants grow on\r\ngood soil, and cover whole acres, in which there is but little grass.\r\nThe fields are coloured of almost uniform blue or white or purple or\r\nyellow as the weeks go on, and various species one after another have\r\ntheir turn of dominance and maturity.\r\n\r\nI paid, first of all, a brief visit to Aix and the lakes of Bourget and\r\nof Annecy, to the gorge of the River Fier, and to the finely-situated\r\nmonastery of the Grande Chartreuse--a huge building, devoid of beauty,\r\nwhich it seems to be difficult to utilize now that the Carthusian\r\nBrothers have been expelled. The richly-coloured Alpine centaury, deep\r\nblue and purple red, was growing in the woods around it abundantly, and\r\nmany other handsome plants. Zoology was represented by most excellent\r\nlittle trout provided for us at the village inn. Then I stayed a\r\ncouple of days at Geneva, where, in a pool in a richly-planted rock\r\ngarden--that of the well-known horticulturist M. Correvon--I came\r\nacross what I have long wished to see, namely, the blue variety of\r\nthe edible frog. Six years ago I wrote an account of the little blue\r\nfrog of Mentone, the rare variety of the green tree-frog, or rainette,\r\nso abundant in that region (see \"Science from an Easy Chair,\" p.\r\n50: Methuen, 1910). The edible frog (Rana esculenta) is often very\r\nbeautifully coloured with blotches of dark brown and pale green, and a\r\npale yellow stripe down the back. It is easily distinguished from the\r\nbrown frog (Rana temporaria), which occurs with it. The latter is the\r\ncommon frog of our islands, though we also find the edible frog in the\r\nSouth of England. The blue variety of the edible frog has been seen\r\nin various localities in Germany and along the valley of the Rhone.\r\nIt owes its colour, as does the blue tree-frog, to the suppression of\r\nyellow pigment in its skin. The one I found was swimming in a small\r\nclear pool with two other very finely-marked specimens of the more\r\nusual colouring. A blue variety of our common brown frog has not been\r\nobserved, although it is occasionally very pale in colour and, on the\r\nother hand, is sometimes of a bright orange-brown tint. Several species\r\nof toads and frogs are found on the Continent which do not occur in\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nYears ago (when France and Germany began the great war of 1869-70) I\r\ntravelled from Geneva to Chamonix by coach. It took the whole day. Now\r\nI and my companion, avoiding the railway, were driven in a motor-car\r\npast Bonneville, Cluses, and Sallanches (with its famous view of Mont\r\nBlanc), and along the vale of Chamonix to its far end above Argentière\r\nin less than three hours. Here we stayed a few days in the Hôtel du\r\nPlanet, at a height of 4500 feet, in order to enjoy the sight of the\r\nmeadows and woodland flowers. I may add that in this quiet hotel the\r\nproprietor gave us simple, good food, well cooked, which is more than\r\nI can say of the large hotels on the lakes and popular resorts, such\r\nas Geneva, Montreux, Glion, and Interlaken, where I have carefully\r\ninquired into the kitchen arrangements and food supplies. The latter\r\nbarrack-like edifices have of late years become intolerable owing to\r\nthe mechanical supply to them (by a group of monopolist financiers who\r\nhave acquired the contract) of the nastiest ice-stored fish, meat, and\r\nvegetables. These are heated in their kitchens with bottled sauces in\r\npatent ovens by underpaid scullery-helps, without the superintendence\r\nof a qualified \"cook.\" The result is a sham--pretentious and\r\ninedible--which yields a fine profit to the hotel companies, and is\r\nerroneously believed by the travelling crowds of to-day to be French\r\ncookery! In reality it is a new device for bringing the \"catering\" in\r\nall hotels in the great holiday centres under a monopolist control. The\r\nscheme is similar to that to which the continental railway companies\r\nhave yielded in leasing to a well-known company the restaurant and\r\nsleeping arrangements on their trains, with the result of causing much\r\nmisery to travellers and profit to themselves and to the monopolists.\r\n\r\nOwing to differences in exposure and soil, the meadowland above\r\nArgentière showed a fascinating variety of colour. Here was an acre\r\nof the large-flowered purple geranium, interspersed with the big\r\nAlpine yellow rattle (a greedy root-parasite); there (near some pine\r\ntrees) a mass of the yellow anemone (Anemone sulfurea); farther on a\r\nwhole meadow, blue with the abundance of large hairbells and viper's\r\nbugloss. Close by, in the damper parts of the valley descending from\r\nthe Col des Montets, three or four acres of meadowland were white, so\r\nthickly were they covered with tall plants of the distinguished-looking\r\nwhite buttercup (Ranunculus aconitifolius). In some parts, among\r\nthese dignified Ranunculi, the plump yellow heads of the globe-flower\r\n(Trollius), also a kind of buttercup, were abundant. Overshadowed\r\nby these larger plants, or growing up between them, were orchids,\r\nplantains, polygonums, and many others. The most beautiful plant in\r\nthese meadows was St. Bruno's lily, which we found in abundance on a\r\nsteep bank. It is named after the founder of the Carthusian order,\r\nwhose monastery (the Grande Chartreuse), first established when William\r\nthe Conqueror ruled England, I had visited a week before. St. Bruno's\r\nlily has large, white, funnel-shaped flowers, an inch or more long,\r\nthree or four on a stalk. It is known to botanists by the pretty\r\nname \"Paradisia liliastrum.\" It is the lily of the Alps, pure and\r\nunspotted, with a delicious perfume, and six golden stamens guarded by\r\nits beautiful and large white corolla. In the woods we found some of\r\nthe larger orchids, and also whole banks covered with the waxy-looking\r\nflowers, variegated in colour, white, yellow, and red, of the large\r\nmillwort, the Polygala chamæbuxus--a plant very unlike in appearance to\r\nthe little blue and white milkworts of England. It flowers in winter\r\nas well as through the early summer. Another wonderfully waxy-looking\r\nflower which we found is that of the shrub known as the Alpine Daphne.\r\nThere is something suggestive of exotic rarity and perfume about a\r\nwaxy-looking flower. Of the same character are the flowers of the\r\nlittle shrubs of the genus Vaccinium known as the bilberry, the\r\nwortleberry, the cow-berry, and the bear-berry, which occur on the open\r\nscrubland. The rusty-leaved Rhododendron, with its crimson flowers, and\r\nthe little Azalea (like the Vaccinia--all members of the Heath family)\r\nwere abundant--as well as the true dark-red rose of the Alps, the\r\nrichly-scented Rosa alpina.\r\n\r\nWe left Argentière and the constant companionship of the great\r\nglaciers of the vale of Chamonix, and descended by train through\r\nthe awe-inspiring valley of the Trient (up which we used to walk\r\nmany years ago, on our way to the higher regions) to Martigny, and\r\nthen drove for four hours up a rough mountain road to the hotel of\r\nPierre-à-voir--whence we descended a few days later in sledges, over\r\ngrass slopes and torrent beds, 4000 feet in an hour and a quarter, to\r\nSaxon in the Rhone valley, a truly alarming experience. The \"luge\" or\r\nsledge is supported in front by a strong mountaineer who prevents it\r\nfrom \"hurtling\" down at breakneck speed, topsy-turvy. As the avoidance\r\nof such a catastrophe depends on the strength and the sureness of foot\r\nof this individual, travelling by \"luges\" is not to be recommended in\r\nsummer, however agreeable it may be when the mountain side is covered\r\nwith snow. In the woods near Pierre-à-voir we found another member\r\nof the Heath family, looking like a lily rather than a heath, the\r\nsweet-scented winter-green with its large single white flower (Pirola\r\nuniflora), and on the rocks on open ground masses of the pink flowers\r\nof the little rock soap-wort (Saponaria ocymoides). The curious tall,\r\nbig-leaved composite with only three purple florets to a head, the\r\nAdenostyles albifrons, was here much in evidence. We were too early\r\nfor the flowers of the pretty little creeping plant allied to the\r\nhoneysuckle which the great Linnæus asked his friend Gronovius to name\r\nafter him, the Linnæa borealis, though we had been told that it grows\r\nin this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThen we spent five days at Glion and on the incomparable Lake of\r\nGeneva, never wearied of gazing at the changing mysterious lights and\r\ncolours (sapphire, emerald, and silver) of its vast and restful expanse.\r\n\r\nThe question often is asked, \"Why is it that the same species of flower\r\nis brighter and stronger in colour when growing high up in the Alps\r\nthan when growing in the lowlands and in our own country?\" The fact\r\nis admitted; the blues of the blue-bells (Campanula), the bugloss,\r\nthe forget-me-nots, the crimsons and purples of the geraniums and the\r\npinks and the campions, and many others, are examples. Careful study\r\nand consideration of the facts have enabled botanists to show, in many\r\ninstances, within recent years, that the peculiarities of form and also\r\nof colour of the stems, leaves, and flowers of plants are not mere\r\nunmeaning \"accidents,\" but are definitely of advantage and of \"survival\r\nvalue\" to the species. Thus we have seen that the tuft-like cushions\r\nformed by high Alpine plants are explained. The purple and reddish\r\ncolour of stalks and leaves like that of the red variety of the common\r\nbeech has not always, as in that plant, the purpose of protecting the\r\nchlorophyll from destruction by too vivid sunlight. In Alpine plants it\r\nis often present on the underside of leaves and of the petals, and acts\r\nto the plant's benefit, absorbing light and converting it into heat.\r\nBut it also seems in many cases to protect the juices of the plant from\r\nthe destructive action of white light.\r\n\r\nIt is held by some botanists that the bright colour of Alpine (and\r\nNorwegian) samples of a flower elsewhere of a paler colour is due\r\nto the direct action of the greater sunlight of the high regions in\r\ncausing the formation of pigment. This is inadmissible. The sunlight\r\ncannot act in that way. It causes increased formation of nutriment by\r\nacting on the chlorophyll, and an Alpine plant thus highly charged with\r\nnutritive matters can afford to form more abundant pigment than a plant\r\nwhich enjoys less brilliant sunshine. The high-coloured Alpine flowers\r\nare a breed or race; a pale-coloured plant taken to the Alps from\r\nbelow does not itself become high coloured. It is a matter of natural\r\nselection. The occasional high-coloured \"spontaneous\" variations\r\nproduced from seed have an advantage in the short summer of the high\r\nAlps. They attract the visits of the few insects in the short season\r\nmore surely than do the paler individuals, and consequently they are\r\nfertilized and reproduce, whilst the race of the paler individuals dies\r\nout from failure to attract the insects. Thus we get a high-coloured\r\nrace established in the mountains, a race that can make haste and seize\r\nthe brief opportunities of the short but brilliant summer. There are\r\nmany peculiarities of form and colour of plants the life conditions of\r\nwhich are diverse (e.g., woodland, moorland, aquatic, seashore, dry\r\nair, moist air, etc.), which can be shown by accurate observation to\r\nbe specially related to those life conditions. Those conditions allow\r\nthe peculiarities to survive and establish a race, in some cases a\r\nspecies, whilst preventing the maturity or destroying the life of those\r\nindividuals not presenting that advantageous peculiarity of variation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AND DANCING\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is at the present day in this country a real and most happy\r\nrevival of interest in the great art of dancing as exhibited on the\r\nstage. We owe this to the creative ability of the musical composers\r\nand directors of the Russian Imperial Ballet, as well as to the\r\nhighly-trained and gifted Russian artists who have visited this\r\ncountry, and especially to the poetical genius of Madame Anna Pavlova.\r\nThough dancing may seem, on first thought, a subject remote from\r\nscience, yet, like all other human developments, it is a matter for\r\nscientific investigation, and one upon which science can throw much\r\nlight. What is the origin and essential nature of \"dancing\"? Do animals\r\ndance? What is its early history in mankind? What is its relation not\r\nmerely historically, but from the point of view of psychology--the\r\nstudy of the mind--to other arts? What is its real \"value\" and possible\r\nachievement?\r\n\r\nTo dance is to trip with measured steps, and, whilst primarily\r\nreferring to human movement, the word is secondarily applied to\r\nrapid rhythmic movements even of inanimate objects. Rhythm is what\r\ndistinguishes dancing from ordinary movement of progression or from\r\nsimple gesture or mere antics. Dancing on the part of man or animal\r\nimplies a sense of rhythm. Though not common amongst animals, it is\r\nexhibited by many birds, by spiders, and by some crustaceans! Rhythm is\r\nan essential feature of the sequence of sounds which we call \"music.\"\r\nThe singing of birds is related to their perception of and pleasure\r\nin rhythm, and it is not, therefore, surprising that they should also\r\ndance. It is, however, curious that the birds which \"dance\" are not\r\nthe \"singing birds,\" and that there are many birds which neither sing\r\nnor dance. The dancing of birds is usually part of the \"display\" of\r\nthe males for the purpose of attracting the females at the breeding\r\nseason. It is well known in some African cranes, as well as in rails\r\nand other similar birds, and may be witnessed at the Zoological Gardens\r\nin London. Other birds \"strut\" rather than dance, whilst displaying\r\ntheir plumage, as, for instance, the turkey and pheasant tribe and\r\nthe bustards. Parrots and cockatoos will often make a rhythmical\r\nup-and-down movement of the neck in time to music, but usually the\r\n\"dance\" is the accompaniment of definite emotion. The male spider of\r\nsome species courts the female by making dancing movements and posing\r\nitself in a very curious way, so as to display a spot of bright colour\r\non the head to her observation. The same kind of movement and action\r\nhas been observed in marine shrimp-like creatures. Some spiders are\r\nexcited and made to dance by the vibrating note of a tuning-fork set\r\ngoing near them. I once had the chance to observe a male octopus in\r\nthe aquarium at Naples, who was displaying himself to the female,\r\nchanging colour rapidly from one shade to another, and rolling his\r\nlong sucker-bearing arms in the form of spirals. Probably one should\r\nnot consider this as a \"dance,\" since no rhythmic interruption or\r\nsuccession of movements was observable.\r\n\r\nIt is established that in mankind, as well as many animals, when in a\r\nstate of emotion, movement and gesture, as well as the vocal utterance,\r\ntake on a rhythmic character, that is to say, become a dance and a\r\nsong. The emotion is not necessarily that of amorous passion; in\r\nmankind it is frequently of a warlike or religious character, and is\r\nworked up by the sympathy, imitativeness, and desire for unison in\r\nexpression which is common in troops or large gatherings of animals of\r\nsocial habits. Man presents a more advanced development in variety,\r\nsensitiveness, and abandonment to social or combined action and\r\nexpression than do other animals, and this is equally true of the more\r\ncivilized and of the more barbarous races. Apparently in obedience to\r\nthe same tendencies as those which convert simple forms of movement\r\ninto a rhythmic dance, the speech of man, under conditions of emotion,\r\nassumes a rhythmic form, so that dancing bears the same relation to\r\nthe ordinary movements of locomotion and gesture which verse does to\r\nordinary speech, or, again, which song bears to mere exclamations\r\nand cries, indicative of feeling. Dancing is the universal and most\r\nprimitive expression of that sense of rhythm which is a widely\r\ndistributed attribute of the nervous system in animals generally. In\r\nprimitive men it is a simple but often very violent demonstration of\r\nstrong emotion, such as social joy, religious exaltation, martial\r\nardour, or amatory passion. The voice and the facial muscles, as\r\nwell as those of the limbs and body, are affected, and the dancers\r\nderive an intense pleasure from the excitement, which so far from\r\nexhausting them leads them on to more and more violent rhythmic or\r\nundulatory action. In its purest form this ecstatic condition is seen\r\nin the spinning dervishes. It was developed into the mad and dangerous\r\nfestivals of the worshippers of Bacchus and other deities in ancient\r\nGreece. It has been seen in mediaeval Europe as the dancing mania and\r\ntarantism. The liability to this and similar forms of \"mania\" lurks\r\nbeneath the surface among populations which are nevertheless staid\r\nand phlegmatic in their usual behaviour. The Romans in ancient times\r\nrecognized its unhealthy character, and though fond of ceremonial\r\ndances and theatrical shows, and even of the performances of dancing\r\ngirls from Greece and the East, disapproved of dancing on the part of\r\na Roman citizen. Cicero says, \"As a rule no one, who is not drunk,\r\ndances--unless he is, temporarily, out of his mind.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the mad performances of bacchanalians and dervishes are\r\nrecognized as unhealthy, civilized peoples in Europe since the\r\nfifteenth century have developed and practised dancing as an art\r\nin two directions--first, as a popular amusement in which definite\r\ncombinations of graceful movements are performed for the sake of the\r\npleasure which the exercise affords to the dancer and to the spectator,\r\nand secondly, as carefully trained movements which are meant by the\r\ndancer vividly to represent the actions and passions of other people,\r\nand are exhibited by specially skilled performers on a stage. The first\r\nkind is what we call \"country dances,\" \"popular dances,\" also \"Court\r\nand ball-room dances,\" and has been commended by the philosopher Locke\r\nand other writers as a valuable training for both mind and body, and by\r\nphysicians as a health-giving exercise. The second is \"the ballet.\"\r\n\r\nIn the dances of savages and primitive peoples, some kind of music is\r\nalways found associated with dancing, the one helping and developing\r\nthe other; they are descendants of one parentage. Very commonly, too,\r\nsome kind of \"acting\"--the representation of a hunt, a fight, or a love\r\nadventure--is an important feature of such dancing. Modern popular and\r\nCourt dances are intimately connected with and dependent on special\r\nmusic, the rhythm and variation of time and strength in which is, as it\r\nwere, illustrated by the dancing, and serves to guide it and to keep\r\nthe dancers in unison. The signification behind all such modern dancing\r\nis courtship--the addresses of the man to the woman, and her elusive\r\nreception or rejection of them. In the Cathedral of Seville, however,\r\nyou may still see, at the festival of the Corpus Christi, a religious\r\ndance, a dance of worship and adoration, performed by acolytes in front\r\nof the high altar. In the early days of the Church such ritual dancing,\r\nby both old and young, was a regular thing, as it was in the still\r\nearlier religious ceremonies of the ancient Romans and in the time of\r\nKing David.\r\n\r\nThe development of dancing as a fine art has only been rendered\r\npossible by the establishment, under the patronage of various European\r\nprinces, of great exhibitions of dancing, called \"ballets,\" and the\r\ncreation of a profession of dancers, who, like professional actors\r\nand musicians, devote their lives to the study of their art and the\r\ntraining necessary for efficiency in its practice. In this, its highest\r\ndevelopment, dancing, whilst maintaining its dominance, is entirely\r\ndependent on the aid of music, and becomes blended with the art of\r\nthe actor and pantomimist. As in \"opera\" the effect of the musical\r\nart is enhanced by the meaning of the words sung, by the acting of\r\nthe performers, and by the accessories of scenery and costume, so in\r\nthe ballet do all these factors, except the human voice, contribute\r\nto the artistic result. The latest development of the ballet is, in\r\nfact, \"grand opera,\" without a voice, without words. Gesture, facial\r\nexpression, and movement of the limbs, marvellous for its grace and\r\ndirectness of appeal, take the place of words. In fact, dance, the\r\nappeal to the eye, takes the place of verse, the appeal to the ear. And\r\nit is a fact, unexpected and astonishing to those new to it, that the\r\nsame quality of \"poetic imagination\" which distinguishes \"word-poems\"\r\nfrom mere doggerel or commonplace verse, can also inspire the great\r\ndancer and give to a wordless dance the unmistakable value of poetical\r\nart, distinguishing it from purely acrobatic or barbaric capering. It\r\nis a fact that poetic imagination may be conveyed in one kind of art\r\nas in another, and that dancing, though greatly limited in its range\r\nof detailed expression, yet is closely similar in its forms to music,\r\nverse, and to glyptic and pictorial art, of all of which it is the\r\nparent and forerunner. Its primitive character is no less remarkable\r\nthan the readiness with which it exerts its charm and develops new\r\nimportance at the present day.\r\n\r\nRegarded as a fine art, and not merely as a pastime, dancing has\r\nfrequently great beauty in its simple quality of the rhythmic movement\r\nof decorative form and colour. The dances depicted on Greek vases had\r\nthis character, and so, with varying degree of merit, have the ballets\r\ncommon during the last fifty years in London and other great centres.\r\nBut before this period the makers of ballets (a word originally\r\nsignifying to dance, to sing, to rejoice, and representing three modern\r\nwords--ballet, ball, and ballad) did not aim at a mere exhibition of\r\nliving rhythmic decoration, but at the production of a theatrical\r\nperformance in which a story is told only by gesture and dancing\r\naccompanied by music. The real modern founder and exponent of the\r\nballet as thus understood was Noverre, a Frenchman (called by Garrick\r\n\"the Shakespeare of the dance\"), who died in 1810. He brought to a\r\nhigh degree of perfection the art of presenting a story by pantomime,\r\nand he never allowed dancing which was not the direct expression of a\r\nparticular attitude of mind. His professed effort was to introduce the\r\nsteps and poses of ancient Greek dancing shown in sculpture and painted\r\npottery--as _the_ model for stage dancing. And he succeeded. The great\r\ndancers of the past who are known to us by tradition--Vestris, Camargo\r\nin the eighteenth, and Cerito, Grisi, and Taglioni in the earlier\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century--were not merely perfectly trained as\r\ndancers, but were actors, and possessed poetic imagination. Women did\r\nnot appear in the ballet until the time of Louis XIV, and Mlle. Camargo\r\nwas the first to wear the conventional short stiff ballet skirt.\r\n\r\n\"Convention\" has a great weight in such matters. But it seems to be\r\nundeniable that the conventional ballet-skirt conceals the beautiful\r\nmovement of the leg on the hip joint, a disadvantage from which\r\nthe male dancer does not suffer. Skirts are, in fact, out of place\r\nin really fine dancing. Flowing light drapery, or better still the\r\nCircassian jacket and full gauzy trousers fastened at the ankles, are\r\nthe only possible dress for a really great _danseuse_.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic ballet or _ballet d'action_ lasted until the end of the\r\nfifties in London, and then ceased almost suddenly to occupy the\r\nleading position which it once held at the Opera House. In London, as\r\nin Paris and Vienna, it was transformed into a mere spectacular display\r\nof costume and meaningless rhythmic drill. The dramatic ballet ceased\r\nto exist. The great tradition of fine stage-dancing and ballet-drama\r\nwas, however, preserved in Russia. It is not easy to explain, but the\r\nfact is that two peoples so far apart as the Russians and the Spaniards\r\nare more devoted to dancing than any other European nationalities.\r\nSuccessive Tsars have spent large sums in maintaining colleges in St.\r\nPetersburg and in Moscow, where boys and girls are lodged and carefully\r\neducated whilst they are trained from the age of ten years in the art\r\nof stage-dancing. The greatest musical composers have been encouraged\r\nto write \"ballets,\" and the ablest designers and \"producers\" have been\r\nsecured by large salaries. Something like £80,000 a year is spent by\r\nthe Tsar on the maintenance and development of this beautiful art,\r\nwhich is dead elsewhere, but seems to fit the genius of the Russian\r\npeople. A new respect for Russia, a profound admiration for the Russian\r\nartists, has been the result of the revelation of the Russian ballet by\r\nthe recent visits of its members to this country.\r\n\r\nDuring the last thirty years of its period of nurture and development\r\nin Russia the ballet has developed in two directions. Neither of these\r\nare popular and successful in Russia, where the old traditional and\r\nestablished ballet of the early nineteenth century--what may be called\r\n\"academic\" dancing--is alone in demand. What we call \"the Russian\r\nballet\" is dramatic in nature, and includes such wonderful combinations\r\nof music, scenery, costume, and perfect artistic expression by dancing\r\nand gesture as we have seen in Scheherazade, Cleopatra, Prince Igorre,\r\nTamar, and Petrouschka. It promises in its latest development to\r\nsupplant the musical drama known as \"opera,\" in which the human voice\r\nis used. But the most striking development is that in which dancing\r\nappears as the exponent of lyrical poetry. It is to the teaching of\r\nIsadora Duncan that the Russian dancers admit their indebtedness for\r\nthis new departure. When undertaken by untrained dancers and amateurs\r\n(even by the innovator herself) the attempt to interpret lyrical\r\nsubjects showed some ingenuity in conception, but failed to command\r\ngeneral appreciation, as the efforts of a painter or an actor, who has\r\nnot acquired command of the material of his art, also fail. But when\r\nAnna Pavlova brought her lifelong training as a dancer and her poetic\r\nimagination to the interpretation of masterpieces of music inspired by\r\nsuch subjects as \"Night,\" \"The Dying Rose,\" \"The Wounded Swan,\" and\r\nthe moonlight mystery of \"Les Sylphides,\" a new and most poignant form\r\nof emotional expression became apparent. A single figure moving over\r\nthe stage with expressive steps and gestures of the arms, with lips\r\nand eyes guided and controlled by consummate art, blended itself with\r\nand interpreted to the spectator the poetic thought of a great musical\r\ncomposer and a great writer. This new development of the dancer's art\r\nmay remain with us. But it requires the presence of one who combines\r\nthe rare gifts possessed by Madame Pavlova--perfect technique and\r\npoetic sympathy.\r\n\r\nMany people derive a definite part of the pleasure given to them by\r\nan orchestral concert from the contemplation of the movements of the\r\ninstrumentalists and the directive interpreting gestures of a great\r\n\"conductor.\" Others would prefer the orchestra and its leader to be\r\nunseen; they find special delight in hearing great music surge and\r\nfloat from no visible source through the dimly-lit aisles of a vast\r\ncathedral. They do not desire their eyes to be called in aid of music\r\nunless the appeal to vision is complete and worthy of the theme. It\r\nis, I think, undeniable that Dr. Richter and my friend Sir Henry Wood,\r\nwhose expressive backs and persuasive hands are so dear to concert\r\naudiences, are a kind of dwindled ballet dancers, connected by the\r\ndrum-major of the military band and the dancing \"choragus\" with the\r\nprimeval phase of the arts when music and dancing were inseparable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nCOURTSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is always amusing to find the lower animals behaving in various\r\ncircumstances of life very much as we do ourselves. There is a tendency\r\nto look upon such conduct on the animals' part as a more or less clever\r\nmimicry of humanity--a sort of burlesque of our own behaviour. Really,\r\nhowever, it has a far greater interest; it is a revelation to us of\r\nthe nature and origin in our animal ancestry of various deeply-rooted\r\n\"behaviours\" which are common to us and animals. The wooing of a maid\r\nby a man and the various strange antics and poses to which love-sick\r\nmen and women are addicted, are represented by similar behaviour among\r\nanimals, and that, too, not only among higher animals allied to man,\r\nbut even among minute and obscure insects and molluscs. In fact, the\r\nelementary principle of \"courtship\" or \"wooing,\" namely, the pursuit\r\nof the female by the male, is observed among the lowest unicellular\r\norganisms--the Protozoa and the Protophyta--and it holds among plants\r\nas well as among animals, for it is the pollen--the male fertilizing\r\nmaterial--which travels, carried by wind or by the nectar-bribed\r\n\"parcels-delivery company\" of bees, to the ovules of a distant flower,\r\nand not the ovules (the female products) which desert their homes in\r\nquest of pollen.\r\n\r\nThe \"reproduction,\" or producing of new individuals, of many animals\r\nand plants can be, and is, effected by the detachment of large pieces\r\nof a parent organism. Thus plants split into two or more pieces, each\r\nof which carries on life as a new individual. Many worms and polyps\r\nmultiply by breaking into two or more pieces, and very often the\r\nbroken-off pieces which thus become new individuals and carry on the\r\nrace are extremely small, even microscopic in size. The spores of\r\nferns and the minute separable buds of many plants and animals are of\r\nthis nature. They grow into new individuals without any fusion with\r\nfertilizing particles from another individual. Yet there seems to be\r\neven in the very simplest living things a need to be met, an advantage\r\nto be gained, in the fusion of the substance of two distinct parents\r\nin order to carry on the race with the best chance of success. We find\r\nthat those organisms which can multiply by buds and fission yet also\r\nmultiply regularly by ovules fertilized by sperms. We see this process\r\nin its simplest condition in microscopic plants and animals which are\r\nso minute that they consist of only a single \"cell\"--a single nucleated\r\nparticle of protoplasm. Such unicellular organisms have definite\r\nshape, even limb-like locomotor organs, shells, contractile heart-like\r\ncavities within the protoplasm, even mouths, digestive tract, and a\r\nvent. They produce new individuals by merely dividing into two equal\r\nhalves or by more rapidly dividing into several individuals each like\r\nthe parent, only smaller. But from time to time, at recurring periods\r\nor seasons, two of these unicellular individuals (of course, two of\r\nthe same kind or species) come into contact with one another, not by\r\nmere chance, but attracted and impelled (probably by chemical guiding\r\nor alluring substances of the nature of perfumes) towards one another,\r\nand then fuse into one. Two (or sometimes several) individuals thus\r\nmelt together and become one individual--a process the exact reverse\r\nof the division of one into two. This is known to microscopists as\r\n\"conjugation.\" The new individual resulting from conjugation after\r\na time divides, and the individuals thus produced, each consisting\r\nof a mixture of the fused and thoroughly mixed substance of the two\r\nconjugated individuals, feed and grow and divide in their turn, and so\r\non for several generations, until again the epidemic of conjugation\r\nsets in, and the scattered offspring of many distinct pairs of the\r\nprevious conjugation-season in their turn conjugate.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the tendency of this process is to prevent the\r\ncontinued multiplication of one stock or line of descent in a pure\r\nstate. By conjugation different lines of descent--the progeny of\r\ndifferent individuals, often brought together from widely separate\r\nlocalities--are blended and fused. And this is, we are led to conclude,\r\na matter of immense importance. To effect this mixture of separate\r\nstocks is, as Darwin has shown, a prime purpose of the habits and\r\nstructures implanted in the very substance of living things, and\r\ndeveloped and accentuated in endless ways and with extraordinary\r\nelaboration of mechanisms and procedure during the immense lapse of\r\nages during which life has unfolded and developed on this earth. The\r\nfusion of different strains by conjugation gives increased variation\r\nin the offspring or new generations: for the two parental strains\r\ndiffer more or less, as all living individuals do, from one another.\r\nThe result of their fusion is different from either parent. In fact,\r\nthe process of fusion itself causes a disturbance--a readjustment of\r\nthe living matter--so that completely new variations result and are\r\nselected or rejected in the struggle for existence. Either parental\r\nstrain was perhaps not so suitable to a newly developed change in the\r\nsurrounding conditions of life as the new blend may be. Thus a more\r\ncertain and active production of possibly useful variations is provided\r\nfor than would be the case were the variations of one self-multiplying\r\nstock alone presented for selection.\r\n\r\nIn the case of simple conjugation the cell individuals which fuse or\r\n\"mate\" with one another, and may be called \"maters\" or \"mating cells,\"\r\nare in all respects similar to one another. But we find among the\r\nunicellular plants and animals cases in which one of the mating cells,\r\ninstead of fusing with another straight away, divides into a number\r\nof much smaller cells, which are very active in locomotion and are\r\nspecially produced in order to mate or fuse with the larger cells. The\r\nmating cells are called \"gametes,\" and the large motionless mating\r\ncells are called \"macro-gametes,\" or \"large maters,\" whilst the small\r\nmotile mating cells are called \"micro-gametes,\" or small \"maters.\"\r\nThe former are of the same nature as egg cells or ovules, the female\r\nreproductive particles, whilst the latter, the small \"maters,\" are\r\nidentical in nature with the sperms or spermatozoa or male reproductive\r\nparticles of higher organisms. In the case of certain parasitic\r\nunicellular animals called coccidia, and also in the parasite which\r\ncauses malarial fever, quantities of small \"mating cells\" are produced\r\nwhich fuse with or \"fertilize\" other much larger mating cells. The\r\nsmall \"maters\" of coccidia have long vibrating tails and minute oblong\r\nbodies, and agree closely in appearance and active locomotion with the\r\nspermatozoa of higher animals and plants. The large spherical mating\r\ncells might be mistaken for the egg cells of larger animals. In the\r\nglobe animalcule, Volvox globator, we find a transitional condition\r\nleading us to the production of small (male) and large (female)\r\nmating cells, like those regularly produced by the massive plants and\r\nanimals which are built up by hundreds of thousands of \"cells\" or\r\nprotoplasmic units conjoined and performing different services for the\r\ncommon life. Volvox is one of those simple aquatic organisms which is\r\nnot a single cell but a group of many cells (some hundred) hanging\r\ntogether--in this case so as to form a hollow sphere. All the cells of\r\nan individual sphere are alike, and have originated by division from\r\none first cell. When the \"breeding season\" arrives one or two cells of\r\nthe sphere increase in bulk--they become \"large mating cells\"--in fact,\r\negg cells. At the same time one or two divide (without separating), so\r\nas to form packets of minute oblong cells with vibrating tails. These\r\nare \"small maters,\" or \"spermatozoa.\" When ripe they separate and swim\r\naway to fertilize--that is to say, to fuse with--the large \"mating\r\ncells\" or egg cells of other Volvox spheres. Such a Volvox sphere as I\r\nhave described is \"bi-sexual\": it produces both large and small mating\r\ncells, both male and female reproductive cells. But sometimes we find\r\nthat a number of Volvox spheres produce only large mating cells by\r\nthe swelling up of one or two of their constituent cells. They are,\r\nin fact, female Volvox spheres. And other Volvox spheres produce only\r\npackets of small mating cells by the splitting and change of one or two\r\nof their constituent cells. They are male Volvox spheres.\r\n\r\nWhen we now look at the higher plants and animals formed of\r\naggregations of innumerable cells (all derived from the division of\r\na first cell--an embryo cell or fertilized egg cell) we find that\r\namongst the mass of variously shaped cells forming the \"tissues\" of\r\nthese higher organisms some are set apart even in early growth as\r\n\"mating cells\" (gametes or reproductive cells). Usually they are in\r\ntwo groups--namely, the ovary, which includes the large mating cells\r\nor egg cells or ova; and the spermary, which includes the cells which\r\nbreak up into small mating cells or sperms. In many animals both ovary\r\nand spermary are present in the same individual, but in most of the\r\nlarger animals (insects, crustaceans, and vertebrates) either the ovary\r\nis suppressed, when the creature is called a male, and produces only\r\nsmall mating cells, or the spermary is suppressed, and the creature\r\nis a female, producing only egg cells. In both cases there may be a\r\ndistinct but minute representative of the suppressed organ present and\r\nrecognizable by its microscopic structure.\r\n\r\nThe point in this history, which seems to be important and must not be\r\nlost sight of, is that the small mating cell is in all the stages cited\r\nactively mobile and swims rapidly through water when its producer is an\r\naquatic animal. The large mating cell is quiescent. It is more or less\r\nswollen with granular nutrient particles--often vastly so enlarged.\r\nIt already is acting the maternal part, preparing nourishment for the\r\ngrowing embryo which will develop from its protoplasm when fused with\r\nthat of the relatively tiny but active male mating cell. And it is\r\ncertainly very noteworthy that when these two kinds of mating cells\r\nbecome separated in distinct \"carriers\" (that is to say, produced one\r\nwithout the other in what are called male and female individuals), the\r\nprimitive character of the mating cells--whichever of the two kinds\r\nthey be--impresses itself on the complex elaborate many-celled organism\r\nin which they arise. The male is the more active, the more disposed to\r\ntravel. It is always the male who seeks, courts, woos, and attacks the\r\nfemale, as the small mating cells seek and attack the larger mating\r\ncells. The character and conduct of the female animal is largely (not\r\nwithout deviations and additions) based on that of the larger mating\r\ncell or macro-gamete; she is the one who waits, is sought, is courted,\r\nand wooed. And like the egg cells of which she is the vehicle and\r\nenvelope, she is specially concerned in the provision of nutriment for\r\nthe early growth of the young.\r\n\r\nCourtship, then, seems to have had its foundations very deeply laid,\r\neven in the earliest and simplest forms of life--at the time when the\r\nprinciple of the union of the substance of two strains to produce a new\r\ngeneration was established, and when, further, the active, seeking male\r\ncell was differentiated from the immobile nourishing female cell.\r\n\r\nAmongst the polyps, sea-anemones, and jelly-fish, though we frequently\r\nfind that there are distinct males and females, there is no courtship.\r\nThis is connected with the fact that, like plants, they are (excepting\r\nthe jelly-fish) fixed and immobile. The male cannot \"court\" the female,\r\nbecause neither of them can approach the other. I once saw in the\r\naquarium at Naples a sudden and simultaneous discharge of a white\r\ncloud, like dust, into the water from half the magnificent sea-anemones\r\nfixed and immobile in three large tanks. The cloud consisted of\r\nmillions of the small \"mating cells,\" and were thrown off by the males.\r\nThey were carried far and wide by the stream running through the tanks.\r\nIn the sea such a discharge would be carried along by currents, and\r\nmight fertilize egg-bearing sea-anemones of the same species growing a\r\nmile or two away.\r\n\r\nIt is when we have to do with actively moving animals that \"courtship\"\r\ncomes into existence. It has many features and phases, which comprise\r\nsimple discovery of the female and presentation of himself by the\r\ncourting male; attempts to secure the female's attention, and to\r\nfascinate and more or less hypnotize her, by display of brilliant\r\ncolours or unusual and astonishing poses or movements (such as dancing)\r\non the part of the male; efforts of the male to attach the female to\r\nhimself, and deadly, often fatal, combats with other males, in order\r\nto drive them off and secure a recognized and respected solitude for\r\nhimself and his mate. The courtship of many insects, crustaceans,\r\nmolluscs, fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals has been watched and\r\nrecorded in regard to these details. Naturally enough, it is in the\r\nhigher forms, the birds and the mammals, that there are the most\r\nelaborate and intelligible proceedings in regard to the attraction\r\nof the female. But when we compare what birds or, in fact, any\r\nanimal, does with what man does, we must remember that man has, as\r\ncompared with them, an immense memory, and has also consciousness. All\r\nother animals are to a very large extent mere automata, pleasurably\r\nconscious, perhaps (in the higher forms), of the passing moment and of\r\nthe actions which they are instinctively performing, but without any\r\nunderstanding or thought on the subject. They cannot think because,\r\nthough some of them are endowed to a limited extent with memory,\r\nthey have not arrived at the human stage of mental development when\r\nconsciousness takes account of memory, a memory of enormously increased\r\nvariety and duration.\r\n\r\nMan has more and more, as he has advanced in mental growth, rejected\r\nthe unreasoning instinctive classes of action, and substituted for them\r\naction based on his own experience and conscious memory, action which\r\nis the result of education--not the education of the school, but that\r\nof life in all its variety. But in many things he is still entirely\r\nguided by unreasoning mechanical instinct, and in others he is partly\r\nimpelled by the old inherited instinct, partly restrained and guided by\r\nreason based on experience and memory. This makes the comparison of the\r\ncourting man with the courting animal doubly interesting. We ought to\r\ndistinguish what he is doing as a result of ancient inherited mechanism\r\nfrom what he is doing as a result of conscious observation, memory, and\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nCOURTSHIP IN ANIMALS AND MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE German poet Schiller arrived long ago at the conclusion that the\r\nmachinery of the world is driven by hunger and by love. If we join with\r\nhunger, which is the craving of the individual for nourishment, the\r\nactivities which aim at self-defence,--whether against competitors for\r\nfood, against would-be devourers, or against dangers to life and limb,\r\nfrom storm, flood, and temperature,--we may accept Schiller's statement\r\nas equivalent to this, namely, that the activities and the mechanisms\r\nof living things are related to two great ends--the preservation of the\r\nindividual and the preservation of the race. \"Love,\" or what we should\r\ncall in more discriminating language \"amorousness,\" or the \"mating\r\nhunger,\" is the absolute and inherent attribute of living things upon\r\nwhich the preservation of the race depends. The preservation of the\r\nindividual is of less importance in the scheme of Nature than the\r\npreservation of the race, and we find that food-hunger and the risk of\r\ndangers of all kinds to the continuance of an individual life are made\r\nof no account when satisfaction of mate-hunger and the preservation\r\nand perpetuation of the race requires the sacrifice or the shortening\r\nof the life, or the permanent distortion or self-immolation of the\r\nindividual. Eccentric behaviour and strange exaggeration of form and\r\ncolour, as judged by the standard of preservation of the individual,\r\nare found to be explained as due to structures (nervous or other)\r\nimplanted in the race by natural selection, because, and in consequence\r\nof, the fact that they tend to the satisfaction of mate-hunger, and\r\nconsequently to the preservation of the race.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the male animal seeks out the female in order to mate\r\nwith her leads to a competition amongst males in \"courtship,\" both\r\nin man and in the higher and lower grades of the animal series.\r\n\"Courtship\" comprises many procedures. Among them are the seizing and\r\nsometimes carrying off of the female by the mate-seeking male; or else\r\nthe attraction of the attention of the female by the male, and her\r\nsubsequent fascination by him, followed by her responsive excitement\r\nand assent to union. Fighting, often to the death, between rival\r\nsuitors not unfrequently occurs.\r\n\r\nAny animal practising the first of these arts of courtship must have\r\ndeveloped greater strength and size than the female, and special\r\nclaws or jaws or prehensile limbs which will become emphasized and\r\nincreased in size by the success of the better-endowed males, and their\r\nconsequent \"natural selection\" as parents. This elementary and violent\r\nform of courtship is found in primitive man, and is inferred to exist\r\namongst the higher apes. It is also seen in many mammals, and in frogs\r\nand toads, and in some of the Crustacea and insects which are provided\r\nwith powerful claws, jaws, or limbs.\r\n\r\nThe second set of \"courtship\" activities mentioned above, which are of\r\na persuasive (often hypnotic) and non-violent nature, are more widely\r\ndistributed and varied. They include a number which come under the\r\ngeneral head of \"display,\" whether the appeal be by sound (the voice),\r\nby odour, or by strange antics and gorgeous colour. They involve the\r\nproduction of the most remarkable special structures; and by their\r\nappeal to the human sense of hearing, smell, and sight are in many\r\ncases well known and familiar to us. Following upon \"display\" are what\r\nmay be classed as \"caresses\"--attempts to soothe and to subjugate the\r\nfemale by the sense of touch.\r\n\r\nThe third kind of activity developed in \"courtship\" is that of\r\nfighting--fighting to the death with other suitors. It involves the\r\nproduction of all those natural weapons, horns, tusks, and special\r\nclaws or spurs with which male animals fight one another at the\r\nbreeding season. It also involves that perfection of muscular strength,\r\nrapidity, and skill in action which have enabled one male to triumph\r\nover others, and whilst destroying or banishing his less perfect\r\nopponent to transmit his own superior qualities to his offspring.\r\nIt seems that to this incessantly recurring and relentless struggle\r\nbetween males, in courtship for the favour of the female, more rapid\r\nand important changes and developments of animal structure and\r\nendowments are due than to the more obvious competition for food,\r\nsafety from enemies, and shelter. Thus muscular power, grasping and\r\naggressive weapons, wonderful colours, forms and patterns which catch\r\nthe eye, perfumes and powers of song and arresting cries, instinctive\r\nantics and caresses, have been developed in the males and transmitted\r\nto some extent to both sexes, but predominantly to the males.\r\n\r\nMr. Pycraft, in his book on this subject,[5] remarks that the\r\ntremendous power of \"mate-hunger\" has been overlooked by a strange\r\nconfusion of cause and effect. Almost universally its sequel, the\r\nproduction of offspring, has been regarded as the dominant instinct in\r\nthe higher animals, but this view has no foundation in fact. Desire,\r\nfor the sake of the pleasure which its gratification affords, and not\r\nits consequences, is the only hold on life which any race possesses.\r\nAnd this is true both in the case of man himself and of the beasts\r\nthat perish. Those whose business it is, for one reason or another, to\r\nstudy these emotions, know well that \"mate-hunger\" may be as ravenous\r\nas food-hunger, and that, with some exceptions, it is immensely more\r\ninsistent in the males than in the females. But for this appetite,\r\nreproduction in many species could not take place, for the sexes\r\noften live far apart, and mates are only to be won after desperate\r\nconflict with powerful rivals no less inflamed. It is idle to speak\r\nof an equality between the sexes in this matter, either in regard to\r\nanimals or in the human race. The male is dominated by the desire to\r\ngratify the sexual appetite; in the female this is modified by the\r\nstimulation of other instincts concerned with the care of offspring.\r\nAmorousness is the underlying factor which has shaped and is sustaining\r\nhuman society, and is no less powerful among the lower animals. Much\r\nthat is considered contrary to human nature, and either outrageous or\r\nridiculous, would be understood and wisely dealt with if knowledge of\r\nnature, including man's nature, were cultivated, and took the place of\r\nvain assertions as to \"what should be,\" accompanied by ignorance of\r\n\"what is.\"\r\n\r\n[5] \"The Courtship of Animals,\" Hutchinson, 1913.\r\n\r\nAn excellent sample of the more violent method of \"courtship by\r\nseizure\" is found in the proceedings of the northern fur-seal as\r\ndescribed by Mr. Pycraft. The old bulls, after spending the greater\r\npart of the year in the open sea, arrive at the rocks which serve as\r\nthe breeding grounds a full month before the cows arrive. The younger\r\nbulls attempt, but fail, to get a place on the rocks. The bull holding\r\nthe most advantageous place--the nearest to the landing-place--starts\r\nthe collecting of cows. Having seized the first arrival, he places\r\nher by his side. As the later females arrive he proceeds in the same\r\nway. He soon has \"herded\" more cows than he can control. He cannot\r\nbe in two places at once, and in scuttling off to chastise some\r\ncovetous neighbour who is eloping with one of his wives, one or more\r\nbulls on the opposite side of his harem proceed to make captures from\r\nhis horde. This sort of thing goes on till all the cows have been\r\nappropriated, according to the herding and holding capacities of the\r\nbulls, leaving a crowd of envious bachelors in the background not\r\nstrong enough or courageous enough to fight. Each bull is master of\r\nthe situation, whether his harem consists of five cows or fifty. If a\r\ncow is restless he growls at her. If she tries to escape he fiercely\r\nbites her, and if she tries to outrun him he seizes her by the skin of\r\nthe neck and tosses her back, often torn and bleeding, into the family\r\ncircle. Sometimes a cow is killed by the struggle of two bulls to pull\r\nher in opposite directions, and in this way the more querulous and\r\ndiscontented cows are eliminated in each generation, and the peculiarly\r\ngentle and passive nature characteristic of the cow seals has been\r\ndeveloped. For three long months the bull seal has to keep watch and\r\nward fasting. This is a most exceptional strain and effort, for in\r\nother animals fasting is associated with absolute rest and sleep. The\r\nbull fur-seal arrives at the breeding ground fat and in fine condition;\r\nhe leaves it, though triumphant, a starved and battered wreck.\r\n\r\nThe more agreeable arts of courtship are exhibited by birds in greatest\r\nvariety and in more familiar examples than in any other animals. The\r\nuse of odours secreted by special glands as attractions to the females\r\nis frequent in the mammals--such as the musk-deer, the musk-rat,\r\nthe civet, and many common hoofed animals, such as deer, antelopes,\r\ngoats, and sheep--but has not been noticed in birds, though known in\r\nbutterflies and moths. It is in the use of the voice in singing and in\r\nthe special display of gorgeous plumage, grown, so to speak, for the\r\npurpose at the breeding season, and in strutting, fantastic posturing,\r\nand in dancing that the male bird excels. Not all birds do all these\r\nthings, and female birds do none of them as a rule.\r\n\r\nI must break off for a moment here to warn the reader that whilst we\r\nfind it difficult not to speak of these activities of the male bird and\r\nmale animals generally in the same terms as we speak of such behaviours\r\nin human beings, there is yet a fundamental difference between the\r\ntwo cases which is apt to be lost sight of in consequence of the\r\nlanguage used. When the musk-deer and other mammals attract the female\r\nby a scent, they have no consciousness or understanding of what they\r\nare doing. They do not as a matter of thought and intention produce\r\ntheir perfume any more than the birds produce their gay breeding\r\nplumage by \"taking thought,\" or the stag his great antlers or the\r\nboar his tusks. Man is, on the contrary, in these matters, as in many\r\nothers, ill-provided with natural automatically-growing mechanisms of\r\nlife-saving or race-perpetuating importance. Though the behaviour of\r\nman in courtship is singularly like that of many animals, he has not\r\ninherited an automatically-produced bundle of charms to allure the\r\nother sex. He has had to think the matter out and to consciously and\r\ndeliberately \"make\" or procure from external sources both perfumes\r\nand coloured decorations and arresting (often absurd and astounding)\r\n\"costumes.\" The males of the most savage and primitive races of men are\r\nlike the bigger apes, devoid of natural \"charms\"; they do not allure by\r\nsweet odours, by brilliant colours, nor by caressing musical voices.\r\nThey have not these possessions as natural growths of their own bodies,\r\nand they have not yet learned--probably not yet desired--to \"make\" or\r\nto \"procure\" them. There is consequently a great gulf in kind between\r\nmany of the details of animal and human courtship. We have no knowledge\r\nof how the extinct creatures between ape and man stood in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of forcible seizure the conduct of the primitive man\r\nis on precisely the same footing as that of the fur-seal. As to when\r\nhe began to learn from the birds and to do consciously what they do\r\nunconsciously--no one knows. In regard to the fighting with other\r\nmales--man appears at a very early period to have given up the use of\r\nhis natural weapons, the teeth, and to have discovered the greater\r\nutility of sharp stones and heavy clubs, and thus to have again\r\nplaced himself apart from male animals, which depend on and develop\r\nautomatically their tusks, horns, and claws in consequence of their\r\nvalue in fighting. The great interest of the jaw of the man-like\r\nEoanthropus from Piltdown is that it was still fitted with a large\r\ncanine tooth like that of a gorilla, big enough to be useful in a fight\r\nwith another Piltdowner (see p. 287). But it dwindled, and in the\r\ncourse of time very early man-like extinct creatures were developed who\r\nhad ceased to have big canines. They made use of chipped flints instead.\r\n\r\nThis substitution by man of \"extraneous\" weapons, decorations, and\r\nalluring appeals to the senses in place of those \"intrinsic\" to the\r\nanimal body is all the more interesting, since we find that such\r\nsubstitution is already made by a number of birds, as, for instance,\r\nthe magpie and the jackdaw, who collect all sorts of bright objects.\r\nThe allied bower-bird of Australia makes a \"play-run\" or reception-room\r\nin which he places shells and bits of bone to attract the female, and\r\nthe gardener bird of New Guinea clears a space in the scrub, roughly\r\nfences it and decorates it daily with bright-coloured flowers and\r\nmushrooms, freshly gathered and placed there by him, as any human\r\nbachelor may decorate his sitting-room for the delectation of his\r\nlady friends! It is a very noteworthy fact that these birds, which\r\nuse extraneous decorative objects as lures, are themselves of dull\r\nplumage, but are allied to the wonderful group of Birds of Paradise,\r\nwhich show the greatest variety and brilliance of intrinsic decorative\r\nplumage known among birds. The love of brilliant decoration is equally\r\nkeen in both groups, and is gratified in the one case by the use of\r\nextrinsic objects, in the other by the growth of intrinsic plumage. It\r\nappears that that strangely anthropoid bird--the penguin--or rather one\r\nspecies of penguin, familiar to Captain Scott and his companions in\r\nthe Antarctic, has a similar habit of using an extraneous object as a\r\ngift or, shall we say, an excuse for an introduction when courting. The\r\nmale penguin is shown in Mr. Poynting's wonderful cinema films of the\r\nAntarctic, picking up a well-shaped stone of some size and advancing\r\nwith it in his beak to the lady penguin whom he has selected for his\r\naddresses. He places the stone at her feet, and retires a pace or two\r\nwatching her. It is as though he said, \"I am ready to build for you a\r\nfirst-class nest; best stones only used, of which this is a sample.\"\r\nIf he is fortunate she looks at the stone and then at him, and without\r\na word waddles to his side. Without more ado she accepts his proposal,\r\nand the work of constructing the stone-built nest is rapidly pushed on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nCOURTSHIP AND DISPLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"displays\" made by male birds and by some other animals which lead\r\nto the \"fascination\" of the females, and apparently to a condition\r\nsimilar to that which is called \"hypnotic\" in man, are very remarkable.\r\nOne is tempted to say that these \"displays\" are made \"for the purpose\"\r\nof fascinating the female. But though that would be correct in\r\ndescribing similar proceedings on the part of a human \"gallant,\" it\r\nis not strictly so in the case of animals, any more than it is true\r\nthat a bird grows its fine plumage \"for the purpose\" of attracting the\r\nfemale. The male bird finds itself provided with fine feathers, and\r\nhas probably a brief conscious pleasure in the fact, just as it has\r\nin singing, but it has, of course, no control over the growth of its\r\nfeathers, nor conscious purpose in their production. Similarly, it has\r\nno knowledge or consciousness of a purpose in the antics of \"display,\"\r\nnor in singing its melodious song, though certainly it is gratified,\r\nand has pleasurable sensations in the instinctive performances which it\r\nfinds itself going through. The great French entomologist, Fabre, who\r\nhas more minutely and thoroughly studied the wonderful proceedings of\r\ninsects in regard to these matters and others, such as nest building,\r\ncare and provision for young, deliberately says, \"Ils ne savent rien de\r\nrien\"--they know nothing about anything! And that is true with only\r\nsmall exception about even the highest animals until we come to man.\r\nSome of the higher animals have a brief and fleeting \"consciousness\"\r\nof what they are doing, and some of the hairy quadrupeds nearest to\r\nman have the power of \"recollecting\"; that is to say, have in a small\r\ndegree conscious memory, and actually do reason and make use of their\r\nmemory of their own individual experience to a very small and limited\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nIt is only in man that the power of reasoning--the conscious use of\r\nmemory, of deciding on this or that course of action by a conscious\r\nappeal to the record of the individual's experience inscribed in the\r\nsubstance of the brain--becomes a regular and constant procedure. And\r\nin the lowest races of man--as, for instance, the Australian \"black\r\nfellows\"--this power is much less developed than in higher races, owing\r\nto the feebleness of their memory. Just as a little child or an old\r\nman recognizes the fact that his memory is bad, so does the Australian\r\nnative confess to the white man that he cannot remember, and marvels at\r\nthe memory of the white man, who, he says, can see both what is behind\r\nand what is to come.\r\n\r\n\"Displays\" are often made by birds which have no very brilliant\r\ncolours. The ruff--a bird of agreeable but sombre plumage--spreads out\r\na ruff of feathers which grows round his neck in the breeding season\r\nand stands in a prominent position alone on the open ground with his\r\nhead facing downwards and his long beak nearly touching the ground.\r\nThese birds are to be seen behaving in this way at the Zoological\r\nGardens in London. When thus posed they have a comical appearance of\r\nbeing absorbed in profound thought. Suddenly, after posing for perhaps\r\nten minutes or more immovably in this attitude, the ruff starts into\r\nlife, running in a wide circle and spreading his wings, and then as\r\nsuddenly relapses into his pose, with downcast eyes and beak touching\r\nthe ground. This, it appears, is all a challenge to any other ruff who\r\nventures near him, and often results in a fight with another individual\r\nwho is offended by his \"swagger\" and attacks him. It also is an\r\ninvitation and attraction to the female or \"reeve\" who is on the look\r\nout for a mate.\r\n\r\nThe display of the bustard, though his feathers are only light brown\r\nand white, is a very strange and arresting performance. In ordinary\r\ncircumstances his feathers are nicely smoothed down, and he looks\r\nneat and fit. But at the breeding season he behaves like Malvolio\r\nwhen he wore cross-garters to please his lady. He approaches two or\r\nthree females who are quietly feeding, and throwing his head back\r\nand his chest forward, swelling his neck out with inspired air and\r\nreflecting his tail feathers inside out (so to speak) over his back,\r\nhe makes the most extraordinary havoc of his previously neat costume.\r\nThe feathers are made to stand up and reflected backwards in groups,\r\nand show their underlying white surfaces round the head, on the chest,\r\nand on the wings and back, so that he suggests the appearance of a\r\nportly old gentleman, in full evening dress, the worse for liquor,\r\nhis high collar unbuttoned and flapping, his short \"front\" bulging\r\nand loose, whilst he maintains all the time a pompous and dignified\r\npose strangely inconsistent with his disordered costume and hesitating\r\ngait. As he struts and poses the lady bustards, though intensely\r\ninterested in his strange behaviour, make no sign, and continue pecking\r\nfor food, as who should say with Beatrice, \"I wonder that you will\r\nstill be talking, Signior Benedick: nobody marks you.\" After enduring\r\nthis snubbing on several occasions and doggedly continuing to display\r\nhis antics, the persistent bustard reaps his reward. One among the\r\ndissembling females can no longer keep up the pretence of indifference,\r\nand suddenly runs off, inviting him to follow her! The same general\r\nscheme of play is seen in the case of the peacock, who spreads his\r\nmagnificent \"train\" around his head and neck (not to be confused with\r\nhis tail, as it often is); in the case of the turkey, bubblyjock, or\r\ngobble-cock, who struts and shows off his coloured wattles and fine\r\nfeathers; in that of the domestic fowl, who raises his head and neck,\r\ncrows, and has a pretty trick of scraping the ground with his wing.\r\nMany other birds perform special antics suited to the display of their\r\nspecial plumage. Among the most varied and remarkable are those of the\r\nBirds of Paradise, which drop through the air, hang upside down on\r\ntree twigs, and pose themselves variously (often warbling the while\r\nseductive notes) according to the particular beauties which distinguish\r\neach species. Cranes and some other birds dance in groups at the\r\nmating season--really dance, making steps and jumps with the legs and\r\nmovements of the wings--in rhythm.\r\n\r\nReptiles do only a little in the way of display. The male newt gets a\r\ncrest in the spring like the wanton lapwing of Tennyson, and a splendid\r\norange-red colour on the belly. Male fishes often develop \"display\"\r\ncolours at the breeding season, and it is a mistake to suppose that\r\ntheir eyes and brains are not sensitive to colour. We have a familiar\r\ninstance in the male of our common little stickleback, who, in early\r\nsummer, builds, in his native pond, his nest of fragments of weed\r\ncemented together, with a wide entrance and a back door. He then\r\nbecomes brilliant blood-red on the belly (he was white before) and dark\r\ngreen on the back, and swims about near the nest, and has an occasional\r\nfight with a competitive neighbour, whilst hustling and shepherding any\r\nfemale stickleback he may meet so as to make her enter it. She enters\r\nit alone, and lays an egg, or, perhaps, two or three, and then goes out\r\nby the back-door! The male, well pleased, at once goes into the nest,\r\nfertilizes the eggs, and swims out again to get another contribution\r\nto his future family. After several females have thus deposited eggs\r\nin his nest, and he has fertilized them, he keeps guard for many\r\ndays whilst the young are developing. Even when they are hatched\r\nhe is in constant attendance on them, for there is danger of their\r\nbeing eaten--not by other males, who are as busy as he is, but by the\r\nemancipated females, who neither build the nest nor care for the young,\r\nbut just lay an egg here and an egg there when invited, and pursue a\r\nselfish life of amusement and voracious feeding.\r\n\r\nIt is still doubtful how far male insects of the true six-legged\r\ngroup appeal to the females by colour-display, even when they are\r\nbrightly coloured, or in other ways than by perfumes (which they do\r\nvery generally), but among the spiders there are some kinds (not\r\ncommon ones) in which the males have on the front of the body one\r\nor two extraordinarily brilliant spots of colour (red, apple-green,\r\nor yellow). The male moves round the female in courtship, and poses\r\nhimself in most curious attitudes, so as to exhibit the brilliant\r\ncolour to her; forcing it, as it were, on her attention. In other\r\nspecies of spiders the male dances and circles round the female, making\r\ncurious and definite antics. Some spiders also have rasp-like organs,\r\nwith which they can make a kind of singing note, which appears to\r\nfascinate the other sex. The vibration of a tuning-fork will cause some\r\nspiders to dance! In most spiders the female is much larger than the\r\nmale--in some cases, ten times as large--and the approach of the male\r\nto the female is a dangerous business for him, for usually after his\r\nembrace she turns on him, kills him, and eats him. This is almost a\r\nunique case amongst animals (though ancient legends tell of princesses\r\nof similar ferocity), and curiously enough is not invariable among all\r\nspecies of spider. In some the males and females are quite friendly.\r\nThe ogre-like habit of female spiders is not so injurious a thing as it\r\nmay appear. For the most nourishing food is thus afforded to the female\r\nwho has to ripen her eggs, and take care of her young, whilst, if the\r\nmale escapes, it appears that he is short-lived and very soon dies.\r\nThis cannibal tendency is very strongly developed also in the allied\r\ngroup, the scorpions. Two hundred scorpions were left in a cage in the\r\nSouth of France, whilst the naturalist (Maupertuis) who had placed them\r\nthere was obliged to go to Paris. On his return he found one large,\r\nvery plump and active scorpion in the box, surrounded by legs and hard\r\nbits of the bodies of the rest. The survivor was in the position of\r\nGilbert's ancient mariner, who said that he was \"the cook and the mate,\r\nand the captain's boy and the crew of the _Nancy Bell_.\" Scorpions do\r\nnot perform any courtship display. The males and females are of equal\r\nsize, and dance together, holding one another by their large claws,\r\nbefore mating and retiring into a burrow.\r\n\r\nCuttle-fishes, squids, and the octopus--called Cephalopods--were\r\nconsidered by Aristotle to be the spiders of the sea. It is curious\r\nhow they not only have a superficial resemblance of form to spiders,\r\nbut in some habits are like them, though the Cephalopods are molluscs\r\nallied to snails and mussels, and are quite unlike spiders in\r\ndeeper structure and remote from the whole group of hard-skinned,\r\njointed-legged animals such as crustaceans, spiders, and insects. I\r\nonce had the chance to see a male octopus \"displaying\" to a female\r\nin one of the tanks of the aquarium at Naples. There were a male\r\nand a female already living there when we introduced from another\r\ntank a second male, which had just destroyed and fed upon a large\r\nlobster, who had himself, with no evil purpose, crushed the head of a\r\nMediterranean turtle foolishly placed by that animal between the open\r\nfingers of the lobster's big nippers. The new arrival promptly drove\r\nthe earlier tenant octopus out of the tank. He pursued his rival round\r\nand round with great rapidity until the latter leapt from the surface\r\nof the water (by a violent contraction of the mantle) and escaped\r\ninto the adjacent tank. Then the triumphant intruder approached the\r\nfemale--floods of changing colour, reddish-brown, purple, and yellow,\r\npassing over the surface of his body--and commenced an extraordinary\r\ndisplay with his eight long sucker-bearing arms. He made these wind\r\ninto close-set flat spirals and again unwind and gracefully trail in\r\nthe water, when they immediately wound up again in spiral coils. The\r\nfemale watched this proceeding for more than an hour, and then they\r\nembraced. I could not follow any further details, but a few days after\r\nthis the female piled up a number of stones, so as to make a nest in\r\nshape like a shallow basin. We enticed the male into a net and placed\r\nhim in another tank, so that he should not be able to molest the female\r\nor to devour her offspring, which he would do if he had the chance.\r\nThen the female laid her eggs--minute oval, transparent bodies, each\r\nwith a long stalk and all joined on to a common branching stem: the\r\nwhole resembled a head of millet seed. The female tended her eggs by\r\ncontinually pumping a stream of water over them, and could not be\r\ndriven from them. She fought savagely and heroically in their defence.\r\nBut I succeeded in enticing her into a net by aid of a toothsome crab,\r\nand then took a few--only a few--of the cherished eggs, and replaced\r\ntheir mother in the tank, where she at once resumed the \"incubation\" of\r\nher eggs. For it is an \"incubation,\" although one in which oxygenated\r\nwater, and not warmth, is the accompaniment of the sitting of the\r\n\"hen.\" I was able to watch the development of the young within the\r\ntransparent eggs, which I kept in a stream of fresh sea-water, and I\r\npublished a short account of what was novel in the growth of these\r\nembryos. It had not been studied previously, nor have I seen any later\r\naccount of the development of octopus. The true cuttle-fish, with the\r\nhard oblong shell sunk in the back, lays each egg in a dark leathery\r\nshell. They look like small grapes, and are left, thus protected, to\r\ntheir fate. They have been studied, both before I obtained octopus eggs\r\nand since, in great detail. The \"squid\" embeds her eggs, many together,\r\nin bunches of long fingers of colourless jelly. Only the octopus and\r\nthe argonaut, among Cephalopods, are known to give maternal care and\r\nincubation to their eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nCOURTSHIP, INSTINCT AND REASON\r\n\r\n\r\nAPART from the familiar instances of male colour-decoration afforded\r\nby birds, we find that even some of the minute water-fleas inhabiting\r\nfreshwater lakes and the sea, and known as Crustacea Entomostraca, put\r\non a courting dress at the breeding season; that is to say, the males\r\nbecome brilliantly coloured with patches of red and blue. And among\r\nthe highest mammals we find that the same colours are, in some cases,\r\ndisplayed by the males as a fascination to the females. This is the\r\ncase with the males of some of the baboons, though not with those of\r\nthe highest man-like apes, who, like the primitive \"savage\" man, have\r\nno decoration, no pretty seductive ways appealing to either the eye\r\nor the ear, but rely on their strength and ferocity to overawe and\r\nparalyze the female. In the male \"mandrill\" baboon the skin of the\r\nsides of the great snout is of a deep blue colour, whilst the nose and\r\na tract behind it is wax-like and bright red. Not only that, but the\r\nbuttocks are brilliantly coloured, a central red area passing at the\r\nsides through rich purple to pale blue. The animal, which is often\r\nto be seen in menageries, is evidently proud of this finely-coloured\r\nregion of his body, and turns it to a visitor and remains quietly\r\nposed, so that it may be well seen and duly admired. The hind-quarters\r\nof other monkeys, both male and female, show a brilliant red colouring\r\nduring the mating season, and the skin and hair of the face is\r\nvariously coloured, so as to produce a decorative pattern (eyebrows,\r\nmoustache, beard, nose, all strongly contrasted in colour) in the\r\nsmaller monkeys, usually more strikingly in the males than in the\r\nfemales. A brilliant emerald-green patch of colour is shown in the\r\nhinder part of the body of the male in one species sometimes to be seen\r\nat Regent's Park.\r\n\r\nThe making of sounds is a capacity possessed by many animals, small\r\nand big. Often it seems to have no particular significance, but, as\r\nin the case of the \"humming\" of bees and flies and the \"droning\" of\r\nbeetles, is the necessary accompaniment of the vibration of the wings.\r\nBut many animals make sounds as a \"call,\" either to other individuals\r\nof their species, irrespective of sex, or more definitely as signals\r\nand appeals to the other sex, just as the luminosity which happens to\r\naccompany certain necessary chemical activities in the bodies of the\r\nlower animals has become specialized and utilized in the glow-worm\r\nand other higher forms as a signal and appeal. The rubbing of rough\r\nsurfaces against one another is developed into a \"stridulating organ\"\r\nwhich we find in crickets, locusts, scorpions, spiders, and even in\r\nmarine crustacea, and it is often specialized as a sexual appeal. The\r\nmere production of sound by tapping against wood is used by the little\r\nbeetle, the death-watch, as a call, and is responded to by his mate\r\nwith similar tapping. Such \"tapping\" is developed into a remarkable\r\nrhythmic vibrating sound by the birds called woodpeckers, and has its\r\nsignificance in courtship. But it is chiefly by the inspiration and\r\nexpiration of air over vibrating cords or membranes called \"vocal\r\norgans\" that animals produce distinctive and musical sounds. In most\r\ncases such animals have a more general and simple \"cry,\" which is not\r\nnecessarily a sexual appeal, but addressed to comrades generally, and\r\nalso a more elaborate cry or song which is primarily used by the male\r\nas an attraction in courtship, but has in the case of many birds been\r\ninherited from original male singers by the females also. The \"singing\"\r\nof birds--apart from simpler cries and calls--is a sexual address, an\r\nact of courtship. It is a display of power and capacity on the part of\r\nthe male, and that such is its character is shown by the competition\r\nbetween male birds in the endeavour to \"out-sing\" one another. Some\r\nbirds become extraordinarily excited in these competitions, which take\r\nthe place of actual fighting, the victor who silences his opponents\r\nbeing the winner of the female bird, who is at hand listening to the\r\ncompetition. Caged chaffinches are celebrated for their eagerness to\r\ncompete with one another in singing. They deliver their little song\r\nalternately until one is exhausted and unable to take up his turn. He\r\nis vanquished. So excited do the birds become that it occasionally\r\nhappens that one of the competitors drops down dead. The beginning and\r\ndirective causes of the particular song of different kinds of birds\r\nis not understood. But it is well known that they have a great gift\r\nof imitation. Parrots, piping crows, ravens, and other such birds are\r\nfamiliar instances, whilst little birds such as bullfinches can be\r\ntrained to whistle the melodies which human beings have invented. Even\r\nthe house-sparrow, which, though allied to singing finches, never sings\r\nat all when in natural conditions, has been converted into a songster\r\nby bringing it up in company with piping bullfinches.\r\n\r\nOther animals which cannot sing like the birds yet use their voices in\r\ncourtship. The frogs and toads are no mean performers in this way,\r\nwhilst cats, deer, and other large animals are \"singers,\" of a kind,\r\nwhen stirred by mate-hunger. The monkeys chatter and make various\r\nvocal sounds, but the gibbons and man-like apes produce excessively\r\nloud and penetrating cries. These cries, though sometimes of fine note\r\nand repeated rhythmically (as in the gibbons and chimpanzees), have\r\nnot the character of song. The beginnings of song in mankind are lost\r\nin the mist of ages. The Australian black-fellows chant and dance\r\nwith rhythmic precision and a certain kind of melancholy cadence, but\r\nthey never attempt to fascinate the other sex by the use of the voice\r\n(nor, so far as is known, in any other way), and, indeed, there is a\r\nvast interval between their vocal performances and the love-songs of\r\nmodern civilized races. Man has not inherited singing from his animal\r\nancestry, but has re-invented it for himself. His real knowledge\r\nand command of \"music\" is actually a novelty which has sprung into\r\nexistence within the last few hundred years.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that animals of the same species are attracted to\r\none another by smell, and that distinct species have distinct smells.\r\nFurther, there is no doubt that in many cases the special smell of\r\neither sex attracts the other. But modern man has so nearly lost\r\nthe sense of smell--why it is difficult to say, excepting that it\r\nis because it was not of life-saving value to him--that it is very\r\ndifficult for us to estimate properly the significance of perfumes and\r\nodours. We know that the dog has what to us seems a marvellous power\r\nof tracking and recognizing by smell, and that other animals appear\r\nto be similarly endowed, though most usually we cannot perceive the\r\nsmell at all which they recognize and follow. It appears that nearly\r\nall the hairy quadrupeds have distinctive odours, which they and their\r\ncompanions can readily recognize, secreted by certain glands in the\r\nskin placed here and there on the body, often on the legs and toes.\r\nSome of these odours, like musk and civet, we can perceive, though most\r\nhave no effect on us. It seems to be an evidence of the absence of any\r\nneed for man to produce \"perfumes\" by the action of his own structure\r\nthat he has a feeble sense of smell and has so little perception of\r\nany perfumes or odours peculiar to himself that he has when civilized\r\nalways made use of odorous substances (perfumes and scents) extracted\r\nfrom other animals and from plants for the purpose, before the days of\r\ncleanliness, of masking the unpleasant odours of putrescence pervading\r\nhis body and clothing. Later, when dirt became less common, he made\r\nuse of perfumes for the purpose of giving an agreeable whiff to the\r\nolfactory organs of his associates.\r\n\r\nIn insects, for instance in moths and butterflies, and no doubt in most\r\nif not all others, the sense of smell is astonishingly keen, and serves\r\nas the great guide and attraction in courtship and the appeasement of\r\nmate-hunger. A single female emperor moth was placed in a box covered\r\nwith fine net in a room with an open window in a country house. In\r\nthree hours a dozen males of this species had entered the room, but\r\nno other moths. In twenty-four hours there were over a hundred, all\r\nfluttering around the net-covered box in which was the female. In this\r\nand other similar experiments it was found that the odour of the female\r\nmoth, though imperceptible to man, clung to the box after she was\r\nremoved, and that, for some days following, the empty box was nearly as\r\npowerful an attraction to the males as when it contained the female.\r\nThe antennæ which carry the olfactory sense-organs are far larger in\r\nthe males than in the females, as is also the case in many other\r\nlower animals where smell is a guide to mating. A single female of the\r\nvapourer moth, which is common in the London squares and parks, has\r\nbeen found to attract when placed in a box in an open window in Gower\r\nStreet a number of males from the neighbouring plantations; and such\r\nis the penetrating and powerful character of these odorous substances\r\nproduced by female moths that in one species, in which the female is\r\nwingless and lives under water, the odour escapes through the water and\r\nattracts the males in quantities to its surface. The females then arise\r\nfrom the depths, and, like mermaids or the witch of the Rhine, draw\r\nthe infatuated males beneath the water to love and death. In several\r\nbutterflies it has been shown that the males produce sweet perfumes on\r\nthe surface of the wings, which can be detected as such by man, and\r\nact as stimulants to the mate-hunger of the female butterflies, which\r\nfollow the scented male in numbers. The sense of smell is thus seen\r\nto be a much more powerful guide in insects than might be supposed,\r\nand it is of equally great importance to them in other enterprises and\r\nactivities of life besides those of courtship. It has also a leading\r\nimportance in all the lower and lowermost animals, and is the ultimate\r\nguide (for smell and taste are not separable in such simple forms) of\r\nthe motile spermatic filament in its journey to the egg cell.\r\n\r\nI have in the course of these notes on \"Courtship\" more than once\r\nstated that though man shares in common with all other animals the\r\nultimate impulse to \"courtship,\" namely, \"mate-hunger,\" yet that it\r\nwould be a mistake to suppose that he has mechanically inherited\r\nfrom animal ancestors (as they do) those methods of attracting\r\nand endeavouring to fascinate the female, such as the use of gay\r\ncostume, dancing and posing, beautiful singing, sweet perfume, and\r\ngentle caresses, which, at various phases of his development, he\r\nhas practised. True, these methods are also practised by a variety\r\nof animals, but not by man's immediate ape-like ancestors. None of\r\nthese means of courtship are inherited instincts or structures in man\r\nas they are in animals. All have been arrived at and devised by man\r\nafresh, as the result of \"taking thought.\" And in the latest advance\r\nof civilization some of them have been to a large extent either\r\ndiscarded or, curiously enough, handed over to the female sex. It is\r\nthe woman now who endeavours to captivate the man by a display of brave\r\ncolours, clothes, plumes, and jewellery, and by exquisite dancing and\r\ngesture. Not so long ago both sexes of man practised such display, but\r\nin earliest times only the male, the woman being allowed to sport a\r\ndiscarded rag or a broken old necklace if she were very satisfactory\r\nand submissive in her general conduct!\r\n\r\nI must endeavour very briefly to explain how this contrast of\r\n\"instinct\" with \"thought, knowledge, reason, and will\" must (as it\r\nseems to me) be regarded. There are three great steps in the gradual\r\nevolution of the mind. The first is the slow formation (by variation\r\nand survival of the fittest) of transmissible, and therefore inherited,\r\nmechanisms of the mind, which are of various degrees of complexity, and\r\ncharacterize different species and kinds of animals. These mechanisms\r\nact automatically like those of a \"penny-in-the-slot machine,\" and are\r\njust as regularly present, and as much alike in all individuals of a\r\nspecies, as are the other inherited structures, such as bones, flesh,\r\nviscera, the skin and its coloured clothing of decorative feathers or\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nLater, and added to these inherited mechanisms--often interfering with\r\nthem and putting an end to them--are the mechanisms of the second step.\r\nThese are mechanisms arising from individual experience; they depend on\r\nmemory--the inscription on \"the tablets of the mind,\" of the experience\r\nthat this follows that. They control movement and action, usurping\r\nthe privilege of the previously omnipotent inherited mechanisms or\r\ninstincts. This second step in the development of mind requires an\r\nexcessive quantity of brain-cells. It only makes its appearance at all\r\nin animals with large brains, and reaches a far greater development in\r\nman even than in the apes, his brain being from twice to three times\r\nthe size of that of the largest living ape. This use of memory and\r\nindividual experience--instead of an inherited mechanism, which is the\r\nsame in every member of the species--is obviously a great advantage\r\nin the struggle for existence. There are traces of it in some of the\r\ncuttlefish and insects, but even in the fishes and reptiles among\r\nliving vertebrates it is of small account, and the small brain carries\r\non its work by good, sound, inherited mechanisms or instincts, but\r\nlearns nothing, comprehends nothing! In the birds we see a little--a\r\nvery little--more capacity for \"learning by individual experience,\"\r\nand it is only in the larger and later mammals that educability, or\r\nthe power of learning by individual experience, becomes of serious\r\nimportance. All the larger living mammals--horse, cattle, sheep,\r\nrhinoceros, tapir--have acquired an enormous increase in the size of\r\ntheir brains--as much as six or eight times the volume of that of their\r\nextinct ancestors whose bones and brain cavities we find fossilized\r\nin the Tertiary strata. Man has by far the biggest brain of all these\r\nanimals, and has a unique degree of educability, together with the\r\nfewest instincts or in-born hereditary mechanisms among animals. He\r\nhas practically to learn by individual experience--and therefore in\r\nthe form best suited to his individual requirements--a host of most\r\nimportant actions and behaviours which even monkeys as well as dogs and\r\nsheep and horses never have to \"learn,\" but proceed to put in practice\r\nas soon as they are born, or, at any rate, without any preliminary\r\nprocess of experiment and effort. Man is the one highly \"educable\"\r\nanimal. In consequence of his large brain and its roomy memory he can\r\nbe, and is--even when a \"savage\"--educated. Monkeys and dogs have\r\nonly small \"educability\" as compared with man, though more than have\r\nreptiles or fishes. Man's mind is, therefore, in this essential feature\r\ndifferent from that of animals. The modern mammals with brains as much\r\nas eight times the bulk of their early Tertiary ancestors have, it is\r\ntrue, acquired \"educability\" and the power of storing _individual_\r\nexperience as \"memory,\" but their memory is far less extensive than\r\nthat of man, and though its guidance is of great value to them it acts\r\nentirely, or nearly so, without consciousness. No doubt man's brain\r\nincludes some hereditary mechanisms, but in the main it distinctively\r\nconsists of nerve-mechanisms, formed by his own individual education,\r\nacting on receptive and specially educable brain matter. And the brain\r\nmechanism formed by education is of greater life-saving value than is\r\nthat of the inherited instincts which meet general emergencies, but not\r\nthose new and special to the individual.\r\n\r\nThe third step in the development of mind is the arrival (for one\r\ncan call it by no other term) of that condition which we call\r\n\"consciousness\"--the power of saying to oneself \"I am I,\" and of\r\nlooking on as a detached existence not only at other existences but at\r\none's own mental processes, feelings, and movements. With it comes\r\nthought, knowledge, reason, and will. We may speak of consciousness\r\nas invading or spreading gradually over the territory of mind. All\r\nthe three steps of the growth of mind which I have distinguished can\r\nbe seen following one on the other in the growth of a human child\r\nfrom infancy to adolescence. The second step--the development of\r\nindividual mechanisms due to memory--is not in most animals, and not\r\nentirely in man, pervaded by or \"within the area of\" consciousness.\r\nMemory is at first \"unconscious memory,\" and there still remains in\r\nman a capacity for forming \"memory\" which never (or in some matters\r\nonly exceptionally) becomes illuminated by consciousness. Apparently\r\nthe inherited mechanisms which we call \"instincts\" are never within\r\nthe reach of consciousness, though, of course, the actions determined\r\nby them are. It is a difficult matter to decide how far the memory\r\nof apes, dogs, and such animals nearest to man is conscious memory.\r\nProbably very little. But it is only when memory, as well as the\r\nimpression of the moment, is pervaded by consciousness that reflection,\r\nand reason and action dependent on reason, are possible.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] I have alluded to this subject again, necessarily with some\r\nrepetition in the chapter on \"The Mind of Apes and of Man,\" p. 262.\r\n\r\nHence it is that man in all the procedure of courtship stands apart\r\nfrom animals. Even the Australian has not only an educable brain,\r\nbut a more or less conscious memory. He seems to be permanently, in\r\nthis respect, in the condition of an ordinary European child of about\r\nfive years old. Gradually in the course of the development, both of\r\nincreased educability and of more and more efficient and serviceable\r\neducation, man has first abandoned by slow degrees his violent\r\nancestral methods of procuring a mate, and has, as the result of\r\nobservation, reflection, and conscious reasoning, taken to courtship\r\nby persuasion and fascination, similar to that of the birds and other\r\nremote creatures, retaining, however, for a long period his habit of\r\nfighting with other males to establish his claim to the woman of his\r\nchoice. And at last, in his later development in civilized lands, he\r\nhas abandoned the more obvious arts of courtship and has taken to\r\ndecorating his womankind instead of himself. He has made woman take\r\nover the habit of courtship by the fascination of colour and pose\r\nwhilst he looks on in sombre clothing with thoughtful reserve. He does\r\nnot any longer even rely on his strength or skill in fighting in order\r\nto scatter his rivals, but makes appeal by word to the sympathy of\r\nthe desired mate and trusts to the fascination which the power, given\r\neither by superior intellectual quality or by accumulated wealth, have\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nDADDY-LONG-LEGS\r\n\r\n\r\nIN early September, golf links and other such grasslands swarm with a\r\nlarge gnat-like fly of reddish-brown body, feeble flight, and long,\r\nstraggling legs. These flies are generally called \"Daddy-Long-Legs,\"\r\nor, by the more learned, \"Crane-flies.\" I find that they are\r\nsometimes confused with another fly of about the same size with\r\nbright reddish-brown body, which is very much less abundant and\r\noccasionally flutters around the lamps and candles in a country house\r\nwhen the windows are open in the evening. This second kind of fly has\r\na formidable black-coloured sting, which it shoots out from the end\r\nof its tail when handled; it has also two pairs of wings, and is an\r\nIchneumon-fly, one of the Hymenoptera, the order of insects to which\r\nbees, wasps, ants, and gall-flies belong. Our daddy-long-legs has no\r\nsting, though the female has a sharply pointed tail. It has only one\r\npair of wings, and belongs to the order Diptera, or tway-wing flies, in\r\nwhich our house-fly and bluebottle, horse-flies, tsetse-flies, gnats,\r\nand midges of vast number and variety are classified. They none of them\r\nhave tail \"stings,\" though the tail may be elongated and pointed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.\r\n\r\nA, The Crane-fly (Daddy-Long-Legs), Tipula oleracea. _e_, the left eye;\r\n_h_, one of the balancers or \"halteres,\" which are the modified second\r\npair of wings; _th_, the thorax.

Enlarged to four\r\ntimes the natural length. _a_, tail; _b_, head.]\r\n\r\nThough the two-winged flies or Diptera have only two wings well grown\r\nand of full size, the second or hinder pair of wings which other\r\ninsects possess of full size, are present in them in a very much\r\ndwindled condition. Since most of our common flies are very small it is\r\ndifficult to see this dwindled pair of wings, which lie close behind\r\nthe first or large pair, and are called the \"balancers,\" or \"halteres.\"\r\nThe daddy-long-legs (Fig. 22, A) is big as flies go, and with a pocket\r\nlens, or even without one, you can readily see the dwindled second pair\r\nof wings standing out clearly from the body behind the attachment of\r\nthe first pair. These \"balancers\" are of the shape of a tennis racket,\r\nor a ball-headed club. They serve no longer as organs of flight, but\r\nas auditory organs. A minute parasitic insect (Stylops) which lives in\r\nbees has only one pair of wings, but in this case it is the hinder pair\r\nwhich are developed, the front pair being shrunk to rudimentary lappets.\r\n\r\nThe daddy-long-legs, or common crane-fly, is a little less than an inch\r\nlong and a little more than an inch across the spread wings. Its power\r\nof flight is not well developed, and its six long legs are moved so\r\nslowly and awkwardly that one would say that its powers of walking and\r\nrunning are also feeble. Their strange movements have led some unknown\r\npoet to imagine the \"daddy\" saying:\r\n\r\n  \"My six long legs, all here and there,\r\n  Oppress my bosom with despair.\"\r\n\r\nIn reality these queerly-moving long legs serve the insect effectively\r\nin making its way among the closely-set blades of grass about which\r\nit crawls. The legs easily come off, and the loss of one does not\r\nappear to be a serious matter. Probably the easy detachment of a leg\r\nenables the fly to escape if one of them gets caught and nipped in\r\noverlapping blades of grass--though such a throwing away of a limb\r\nseems a rather reckless proceeding, especially since the insect has\r\nno power of \"regeneration\" as it is called, that is, of growing a new\r\nleg to replace the lost one. There are several well-known instances\r\nof animals which have the power of breaking off a leg or the tail if\r\nseized by an enemy or otherwise gripped. The smaller lizards and the\r\nlegless lizard, called the \"slow-worm,\" have this power in regard to\r\nthe tail, but they proceed to grow a new tail after they have escaped.\r\nSome marine worms have a similar faculty, and some star-fishes (hence\r\ncalled \"brittle-stars\") have a most annoying habit of throwing off\r\ntheir \"arms\" when caught. The central disk of these star-fish, with all\r\nits arms shed, can \"regenerate\" the lost parts. Crabs, too, of various\r\nkinds have the habit, when caught by the leg, of breaking it off, and\r\nthey may often be found with a completely-formed little leg, which\r\nhas been \"regenerated\" or grown afresh, and will in due time attain\r\nfull size. The beautiful hairy skin of the tail of the little dormouse\r\nalso will come off when the animal is caught by it, leaving the bony\r\nblood-stained skeleton of the tail exposed to dry and wither up. There\r\nis no re-growth in this case. I was horrified when I was a boy to see\r\nsix dormice reduced to this condition in the bird and beast shop on the\r\nstaircase of the old Pantheon bazaar. They had escaped from their cage\r\nwhilst I was looking on, and the shopman endeavoured to catch them,\r\nwith this distressing result.\r\n\r\nSo we find that the loss of its legs by the \"daddy\" is a means of\r\nsafety to it, and is a similar provision to that seen in some other\r\nanimals. It seems improbable that the \"old father long-legs\" who\r\n\"would not say his prayers\" (according to an ancient nursery rhyme),\r\nis a myth referring to a daddy-long-legs of the insect kind, since the\r\nrecommendation to \"take him by his left leg and throw him downstairs\"\r\nwould have been futile; his left leg would have come off as soon\r\nas seized, and have greatly embarrassed the individual intending\r\nto throw him downstairs! Another kind of insect-like animal, which\r\noccurs commonly in cobwebby outhouses, and has a globular body and\r\neight very long legs--easily broken off--is also commonly called a\r\n\"daddy-long-legs.\" It has no wings, and is allied to the spiders,\r\nthough it is not a true spider--having a minute pair of nippers near\r\nits mouth, instead of the pair of stabbing claws which spiders have.\r\nIt is frequently called a \"harvester,\" a name loosely applied to other\r\nsmall creatures. It is known to zoologists as Opilio.\r\n\r\nOur crane-flies, or daddy-long-legs, when they swarm about the grass\r\nare intent on two objects. They do not require food; they have had\r\nenough when they were grubs concealed in the soil. They are now busy,\r\nfirst, in pairing, so that the females' eggs may be fertilized; and,\r\nsecondly, the females are about to choose a likely piece of ground in\r\nwhich to bore with their pointed tails and lay their eggs. They prefer\r\nrather damp spots, shaded from the fierce drying heat of the sun, for\r\nthis purpose. When laying her eggs, the female balances herself with\r\nher legs in an upright position, and, pushing the sharp tail into the\r\nearth, moves round by the aid of her legs, to the right and to the\r\nleft, so as to bore a quarter of an inch or so into the loose soil.\r\nThen she lays two or three eggs, and, coming down from her upright\r\npose, moves on through the blades of grass for 3 or 4 inches, and again\r\ntakes an upright attitude, and repeats the boring and egglaying. The\r\neggs are very small, black, shining grains, of which as many as 300 are\r\nfound in the body of one ripe female. The male crane-fly has a broad,\r\nsomewhat expanded end to its body, by which it is easily distinguished\r\nfrom the female.\r\n\r\nFrom the eggs minute maggots or grubs hatch and feed upon animal and\r\nvegetable refuse in the soil, but as they increase in size they\r\nburrow an inch or so into the ground among the grass roots. There\r\nare two broods, one in spring and a more abundant one in August and\r\nSeptember. The grubs have no legs. Insect grubs are often legless, as,\r\nfor instance, the maggots or \"gentles\" of bluebottle-flies. Or they\r\nare provided with short legs, as, for instance, are the \"caterpillars\"\r\nor grubs of moths and butterflies. The grubs of the crane-fly (Fig.\r\n22, B) show eleven rings or segments to the body, and have a tough\r\ngrey or brownish skin, which is so firm as to give them the name of\r\n\"leather-jackets.\" They have a head provided with a pair of short,\r\nstrong mandibles or jaws, and a very short pair of feelers (antennæ).\r\nThese grubs grow to be an inch and a half long, and are two-thirds\r\nthe thickness of a common quill pen. They gnaw with their hard jaws\r\nthe young shoots and roots of grass, and do an enormous amount of\r\ndamage to grassland. They are rarely seen except when a sod is lifted,\r\nbut in late spring and summer, when the grub changes to a motionless\r\npupa or chrysalis, they may be seen protruding for about a third\r\nof their length from the surface amidst the grass tufts. Birds eat\r\nthem and rooks dig with their beaks into the sod in order to pull\r\nthem out, leaving a number of small pits (on the golf links) where\r\nthey have been at work. The proper name of these injurious grubs is\r\n\"leather-jackets.\" They are often confused with another grass-and-wheat\r\npest, the \"wire-worm,\" and are in consequence sometimes called \"false\r\nwire-worms.\" The \"wire-worm\" is the grub of a beetle (Fig. 22, C\r\nand D), and is very different in appearance and history from the\r\n\"leather-jacket,\" though both of them do great damage to grass and to\r\ngrain crops.\r\n\r\nThe common crane-fly, or daddy-long-legs, is called Tipula oleracea by\r\nentomologists, and is abundant in Europe as well as in these islands.\r\nThere are other \"species\" of the genus Tipula common in England,\r\nnamely, a smaller kind with spotted wings, Tipula maculosa, or the\r\nspotted crane-fly, and a large kind called Tipula paludosa, which\r\nfrequents marsh land. There are many species of Tipula in other parts\r\nof the world, and there are closely allied kinds which are ranked in\r\ndistinct genera, differing a little in certain features from the genus\r\nTipula. These all form, taken together, the family Tipulidæ. They,\r\ntogether with the various kinds of gnats or \"mosquitoes,\" the midges\r\nand fungus-flies, form one of two divisions into which the two-winged\r\ninsects or Diptera are divided, namely, those with long, thread-like\r\nfeelers or antennæ (Nemocera--thread horned), the other division\r\nbeing those with quite short antennæ (Brachycera--short horned). The\r\nlatter group comprises the flies with thick, heavy bodies, such as the\r\ncommon house-fly, the bluebottle, the horse-flies, bott-flies, and\r\ntsetse-flies. The long-horned group have usually long, narrow bodies\r\nand long, narrow wings, which do not at once lie flat on the back\r\nwhen the fly alights (as do those of the short-horned group, as, for\r\ninstance, those of the common house-fly). The females of the common\r\ngnat (Culex pipiens) and numerous allied species are bloodsuckers. The\r\nvarious midges are mostly harmless, whilst others have females which\r\nsuck blood. The crane-flies do not bite. The real feeding of all these\r\ngnat-like flies is done when they are in the grub phase of their life,\r\nbut the females of some gnats and midges appear to have the need of\r\nextra nourishment when in the fully-formed free-flying state, in order\r\nto ripen their large bulk of eggs. Hence, in some cases, they (but not\r\nthe males) suck the juices of plants and the blood of animals.\r\n\r\nThe larval or grub phase of life is passed by many of these flies in\r\nthe earth amidst putrefying vegetable and animal refuse on which they\r\nfeed, as in the instance of the daddy-long-legs; but here and there we\r\nfind species which penetrate into the soft parts of plants and animals.\r\nA whole group of many species burrow into mushrooms and other fungi\r\nwhen they are grubs; others, again, live in water when they are grubs\r\nor \"larvæ,\" and have a very active aquatic life, rising to the surface\r\nto breathe air and searching for food in the water with their feelers\r\nand eyes, and seizing it with their powerful jaws. The mother fly in\r\nthese cases lays her eggs in a group on the surface of the water or\r\nembedded in a jelly which she secretes and attaches to the leaves of\r\nwater plants. Some of the short-horned flies (bott-flies and others)\r\nlay their eggs in the living flesh of warm-blooded animals, including\r\nman, and the maggots hatch there and feed on the juices of the\r\n\"flyblown\" animal. Cases are not rare of children being thus infested.\r\n\r\nThe black flies which fly in swarms \"high\" or \"low\" in the country\r\nlanes on summer evenings are not true biting gnats, but a large kind\r\nof midges known as Chironomus or Harlequin flies. Their eggs are laid\r\nin the water of ponds, and the larvæ on hatching bury themselves\r\nin the rich black mud and feed there. The larvæ are of a splendid\r\nblood-red colour, and are often called \"blood-worms.\" They owe their\r\ncolour to the presence in their blood of the same red oxygen-seizing\r\ncrystallizable substance, hæmoglobin, which gives its red colour to\r\nthe blood of man and other vertebrates. Its presence is remarkable,\r\nbecause in all other insects the blood is colourless or of pale blue or\r\ngreen tint. It seems that this hæmoglobin renders service to the larvæ\r\nof the big midges as it does to some other creatures which live in\r\nimpure water, where free oxygen is very small in quantity, namely, it\r\nenables them to absorb and hold by loose chemical combination the small\r\nquantity of oxygen available. The minute midges called \"Hessian fly\"\r\nand \"Cecidomyia\"--injurious to cereal crops--should be mentioned here\r\nas among the allies of crane-flies, as also the blood-sucking midges,\r\nCeratopogon, and the minute blood-sucking sand-flies or Buffalo-flies,\r\ncalled \"Simulium.\" Species of Ceratopogon, so minute as to be barely\r\nvisible, cause terrible annoyance by their bites to the salmon-fisher\r\nin Scotland, where they often swarm in countless numbers. The\r\nBuffalo-flies attack man, but in some districts of North America alight\r\nin thousands on cattle, and cause death in a few hours. A harmless\r\nlong-horned fly is \"the plumed fly,\" Corethra, the large aquatic larva\r\nof which is glass-like and quite transparent, and offers splendid\r\nfacilities for microscopic research. I used to take it every year in a\r\npond near Hampstead Heath.\r\n\r\nThe leather-jackets, or grubs of the common crane-fly (Fig. 22,\r\nB), sometimes destroy hundreds of acres--even whole districts--of\r\ngrassland in England and France by gnawing the young subterranean\r\nroots and shoots of the grass. They also destroy young wheat crops.\r\nThe leather-jacket is regarded by agriculturists as an intractable\r\npest, since it gets too deep into the turf to be destroyed by chemical\r\npoisons. Its thick skin also makes it very resistant to such treatment.\r\nWhen immersed in brine for twenty-four hours the grubs are not killed;\r\nprolonged immersion in water is equally ineffective; they may be frozen\r\nuntil they are brittle, and will yet recover; and when kept three weeks\r\nwithout food, still remain alive. Birds are their natural enemies, and\r\nrooks not only dig after the grubs, but swallow the flies at the rate\r\nof four a minute! Ploughing up the land in which the grubs abound is\r\nrecommended as a means of destroying them, and also the application\r\nof gas-lime to the ground. Rolling the turf and pressing it down also\r\nkills the grubs, but the best chance of diminishing their ravages is\r\nfound in draining wet land and in feeding up the young grass plants\r\nwith \"fertilizers,\" so that they may grow rapidly and resist the\r\ninjurious effect of the leather-jackets' nibbling.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject it will be found interesting to contrast\r\nthe \"leather-jacket\" with the true \"wire-worms,\" which are the grubs of\r\na remarkable kind of beetle (there are half a dozen British species)\r\ncalled the click-beetle (Fig. 22, C). They belong to a great family\r\nof beetles (Coleoptera), known as the Elaterids or Elaters, of which\r\n7000 species are known, sixty being British. Some of the most brilliant\r\nlight-giving or phosphorescent insects (not, however, the common\r\nglow-worms) belong here. The click-beetles are so called because when\r\none is laid on its back it regains its proper pose, with the legs\r\nbeneath it, by a spring or \"skip,\" accompanied by a sharp click. The\r\ngrubs of the click-beetles, known as \"wire-worms\" (the name is also\r\napplied to centipedes), are more threadlike, that is to say narrower,\r\nthan the leather-jackets. They are not legless \"maggots,\" but have\r\nthree pairs of small legs (Fig. 22, D). They destroy corn and grass,\r\nand do not change into the adult condition in a few months, as do the\r\nleather-jackets, but remain for three, and in some cases five, years\r\nin the ground feeding on the roots of the corn and grass plants, doing\r\nmuch destruction before they finally change into beetles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE MOTH AND THE CANDLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIN order to understand and interpret correctly the operation of\r\nnatural selection in producing new species and maintaining them, by\r\n\"the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life\" (to use\r\nDarwin's words), we must take a wide and, at the same time, a minutely\r\naccurate survey of the living world. We must seek out the evidences of\r\nthis operation and use the imagination in forming conceptions as to the\r\nvaried steps of the process and the results which are likely to ensue\r\nfrom it at different stages and in different conditions. We cannot\r\ninterpret the existing structures and behaviour of living things by the\r\nuse of a simple formula, such as that set up by some writers who have\r\nnot properly studied Mr. Darwin's works, and declare that, according to\r\nhim, all structures and behaviours which we observe in living things\r\nare perfect and the finished result of survival of the ideally fittest\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nPlants and animals are so complex (as no one has shown more clearly\r\nthan Darwin), not only in their structure but in the chemical and\r\nphysical action and interaction of their living parts, that in the\r\ncourse of the ages during which the present species have been, step by\r\nstep, fashioned in the endless vicissitudes of a changing world, many\r\nof them have retained structures or chemical constitutions which once\r\nwere useful but now are useless, or even positively injurious. Even\r\ninjurious structures or behaviours may be retained and inherited by a\r\nspecies of plant or animal, if, on the whole, the other accompanying\r\nmodifications of structure are valuable--that is, of \"life-saving\"\r\nvalue, so that, \"on the whole,\" the race is favoured by selection in\r\nthe struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nIn species which have but lately acquired dominance or are brought\r\nby their success into novel conditions, we may, and do, find old\r\nstructures and behaviours still persisting which are injurious, not\r\nyet, as it were, \"cleaned up\" and got rid of as they would be in the\r\ncourse of further long periods of selection. Such species become\r\nestablished, and may even acquire a definite stability, because the\r\ninjurious structures or behaviours which they have retained are of\r\nlittle or no account as compared with the other advantageous characters\r\nwhich the species have developed. The term \"disharmonies\" is applied to\r\nsuch injurious characters, consisting in a certain want of harmony (in\r\nminor respects) between the structure of an organism and the conditions\r\nin which, nevertheless, it thrives.\r\n\r\nSuch species, imperfect because of their \"disharmonies,\" are an\r\nillustration of the fact that Nature herself, in matters relating to\r\nliving things, is not averse to compromise. Nature sets the example\r\nof toleration. Toleration may be defended on the ground that it is\r\nthe biological method. Nature, though stern and inexorable as to\r\nessentials, yet accepts the faults and defects of some of her children\r\nbecause of the virtues and excellences which accompany them. The most\r\nhighly endowed and successful forms on account of their dominance and\r\npower of spreading into new conditions, are even more likely than\r\nless highly developed kinds to retain concealed defects--disharmonies\r\nwhich do not lead to the destruction of the species, but occasionally\r\ncause strange embarrassment to it until they are, possibly in the long\r\nprocess of ages, got rid of by the slow operation of selection and\r\nsurvival of those individuals in which the injurious character varies\r\nin the direction of diminution and ultimate disappearance.\r\n\r\nIn man (owing, apparently, to the rapid rate at which he has been\r\ncarried along towards dominance over the whole face of the globe by the\r\ndevelopment of his intelligence) the bodily structure has failed to\r\nkeep pace with and to become perfected, \"trimmed up,\" and completely\r\nadapted to, the newly-acquired habits which his increasing intelligence\r\nhas forced on him. His \"wisdom teeth\" are \"disharmonies.\" They are now\r\nuseless and dwindled, weak spots open to the attacks of disease--since\r\nthey are no longer needed for grinding coarse vegetable food, and are\r\nconsequently no longer kept (by the speedy death of those individuals\r\nin whom they are small) at the full original size and efficiency seen\r\nin the apes. His large intestine is a \"disharmony\" not yet got rid of\r\nby natural selection, although no longer useful, but, on the contrary,\r\nthe seat of poisonous putrefaction and absorption of such poisons. His\r\ntail--a few small vertebræ beneath the skin--is absolutely useless,\r\nand occasionally the seat of dangerous injury or disease. Tails very\r\ngenerally are liable to become useless in the descendants of animals\r\nin which they were invaluable as \"fly-brushes\" (cattle, horses, etc.),\r\nas prehensible organs (American monkeys), as concealing cloaks (South\r\nAmerican ant-eater), as aids to swimming or flying, or as ornamental\r\nglories (the big-cats and others). The stumpy tail of the lynx, of\r\nsome monkeys, and some lizards and fishes tells of a history in which\r\nthe full-sized tail became a \"disharmony\"--a positive nuisance--and\r\nhas been reduced, even if not abolished, by natural selection of\r\nshort-tailed or tail-less varieties.\r\n\r\nWe have to be careful in asserting that any structure or behaviour in\r\nan organism is certainly a \"disharmony,\" for it is very difficult to be\r\nquite sure as to the complete details of the life of a wild creature,\r\nand so to be able to form a conclusion rather than to suggest a\r\npossibility--as to the part played by an apparently injurious structure\r\nor habit in the economy of that creature.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking instances of a habit or behaviour which\r\npersists and dominates the life of a wild animal to its own injury\r\nand destruction is that shown by many moths and other insects, which\r\nare attracted at night by a flame (a lamp or an open fire), and fly\r\ninto it even when burnt by it, again and again until they are killed.\r\nA burnt child dreads the fire; but a burnt moth or a singed ichneumon\r\nfly seems to enjoy being burnt, and becomes more and more excited by\r\nits dashes into the flame until it finally drops with shrivelled wings\r\nto the ground. My brother told me some years ago of the verandah of\r\nhis house in Java in which an open lamp was lit every night. Regularly\r\ntwo sets of animals, driven and guided by the action of the light on\r\ntheir nervous mechanism, arrived on the scene. Swarms of moths and\r\nflies dashed in and out of the flame and fell, maimed by the heat, to\r\nthe ground. There a strange group had already assembled. Gigantic toads\r\nand wall lizards crept from their holes in the masonry and woodwork,\r\nand awaited the shower of injured insects, which they snapped up in\r\neager rivalry as the infatuated flame-seekers dropped, hour after\r\nhour, to the floor. The instinct, the nervous mechanism, which\r\nbrought the greedy reptiles to the spot was a \"harmony,\" a valuable\r\nguide to nutrition; whilst the flame-seeker's impulse is assuredly a\r\n\"disharmony\"--a defect in adjustment--leading to death.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to inquire into the probable origin of this fatal\r\ndesire for close contact with a source of light, a desire so strong as\r\nto be entirely unchecked by the deadly heat accompanying the light.\r\nThe May-flies or Ephemerids are delicate little creatures, having four\r\nnet-veined wings rarely more than three-quarters of an inch across,\r\nwith two or three long filaments hanging from the tail. Three hundred\r\nspecies are known from all parts of the world, of which forty occur in\r\nthe British Islands. They live as wingless, six-legged larvæ in the\r\nwater for a couple of years, feeding voraciously. Then one summer's\r\nevening they very rapidly escape from their larval skin and fly over\r\nthe water in countless swarms. But only for a few hours. The eggs of\r\nthe females are fertilized, and they all, both males and females,\r\ndrop dead or dying into the water, where they are greedily devoured\r\nby fishes. The males are far more numerous than the females; in some\r\nspecies as many as 6000 males to one female have been counted. They\r\nare attracted to an extraordinary degree by lights (flames or electric\r\nlamps) set up for nocturnal illumination by civilized man, and in some\r\ndistricts they are collected by fishermen in this way for use as food\r\nfor fish, or were so in Holland in the eighteenth century according\r\nto Swammerdam's statement in his \"Biblia Naturæ.\" Why do they thus\r\nseek artificial lights? There is some indication of an explanation\r\nin the fact that two tropical species of May-flies are known which,\r\nlike the glow-worms and fire-flies, produce light in their bodies. The\r\nMay-flies, especially the males, have unusually large and prominent\r\neyes, as is the case with phosphorescent fishes and some other\r\nlight-producing animals, and it appears probable that in the now rare\r\ninstances of self-luminous May-flies, the sexes are attracted to one\r\nanother by the light they produce, as is the case in other luminous\r\ninsects. It seems probable that the ancestral May-flies, of which many\r\nremarkable kinds have been discovered in the fossilized condition in\r\nstrata as far back in time as those of the coal-measures, were all\r\nself-luminous, and acquired an overpowering instinct of seeking the\r\nlight given out by other individuals as a necessary step towards sexual\r\ncongress. In the course of ages other senses (probably smell and touch)\r\nhave been called in to bring the fluttering insects into association.\r\nThe power of producing light, being no longer needed, has disappeared\r\nfrom all but two rare species. But the urgent erotic instinct, the\r\nnervous mechanism, which drove the ancient May-flies towards the\r\ndancing lights of other May-flies, has remained unaltered in all the\r\nliving species of the group. It is a \"disharmony\" which has not been of\r\nsufficient destructive importance to be \"cleared away\" or suppressed\r\nby natural selection. In pre-human times, nocturnal fires and lights\r\nwere too uncommon to cause much disaster to the May-flies. But now that\r\nmankind sets up everywhere his nocturnal flames and electric lamps, the\r\npreviously unimportant useless survival of an overpowering impulse to\r\nrush to nocturnal lights, reveals itself as a serious and death-dealing\r\n\"disharmony.\" We must suppose, on this theory, that the other insects,\r\nsuch as moths and certain flies (by no means all insects), which also\r\nmadly fly into nocturnal lights to their own destruction, have had\r\nluminous ancestors and a similar early history. This is a legitimate\r\nsupposition, since there are several very distinct kinds of insects\r\nknown at the present day which are luminous at night, although no\r\nexisting moths or butterflies are known to be so.\r\n\r\nA fact bearing on the explanation of the insects' perilous rush to\r\nflame is that birds when migrating are attracted by the great brilliant\r\nlamps of lighthouses, and, flying towards them, strike against their\r\nglass coverings, and are killed in considerable numbers. In that case,\r\nit may be that the flying towards the sun has become instinctive, and\r\nthat the bright light of the lighthouse acts upon a certain number of\r\nbirds (perhaps the less well-adjusted individuals) so as to call forth\r\nthe same response in the direction of flight as that exercised by the\r\nsun's globe. The truth or error of this suggestion should be tested by\r\nan examination of the species of birds which kill themselves against\r\nlighthouse lanterns, and a knowledge of the season and direction of\r\ntheir migration.\r\n\r\nAs to luminous or phosphorescent (often called \"luminescent\") insects\r\nand other animals, there are a great many curious and interesting facts\r\nknown. There are luminescent bacteria (common on old meat bones and\r\ndead fish and in the sea generally), animalcules of various species,\r\njelly-fish, star-fish, worms, shell-fish, and crustaceans and true\r\nfishes. Inhabitants of the great depths of the ocean of all kinds\r\nare usually luminescent. The light is caused by the oxidation of a\r\npeculiar fatty substance. Without free oxygen there is no luminescence,\r\nand yet no heat is produced but merely light, as when a stick of\r\ndamp phosphorus glows. The luminescence of living things (often, but\r\nundesirably, called phosphorescence) is a process differing greatly\r\nfrom that called \"phosphorescence\" in minerals and crystals, such as\r\nthe emission of light by a lump of white loaf-sugar when crushed.\r\nYou may see that kind of phosphorescence by standing in front of a\r\nlooking-glass in a dark room and crushing a lump of loaf-sugar with\r\nthe teeth, keeping the lips raised. It seems that in many organisms\r\nluminescence occurs without any consequent use or service to the\r\norganism. But in higher forms the power of emitting light has been\r\nseized upon by natural selection having become of value in attracting\r\nthe individuals of a species to one another, or in attracting prey, or\r\nagain in scaring enemies. The luminescent matter is concentrated in\r\ncertain definite organs, and the access to it of oxygen and even its\r\nformation are controlled by the nervous system.\r\n\r\nAmong insects far better known than the rare luminescent May-flies,\r\nare the glow-worms, a family of beetles of which several species are\r\nknown besides our own familiar one, called Lampyris noctiluca. The\r\nfire-flies of Southern Europe--Luciola italica--are small beetles\r\nallied to the glow-worm, but both sexes fly and both are luminous,\r\nwhilst in the common glow-worm the female is wingless, and the flying\r\nmale, who is guided to the female by her light (which she can vary in\r\nintensity), gives but a feeble light. The swarms of Italian fire-flies\r\nconsist of as many as a hundred males to one female, and the males are\r\nfar more brilliant than the females. My fellow-student Moseley showed\r\nsome in oxygen gas at the Royal Society's soirée many years ago. The\r\ngas greatly increased their brilliancy. Many valuable experiments\r\nin search of an explanation of the brilliance of the male Luciolæ\r\nand their excess in number could be carried out in North Italy. A\r\npeculiar grub-like female glow-worm, three inches long, is found in\r\nSouth America, which produces a red light at each end of the body and\r\nnumerous points of green light on each side of it. It is called the\r\n\"railway-beetle\" in Paraguay.\r\n\r\nAnother family of beetles besides the Lampyrids, or glow-worms, is\r\ncelebrated for the brilliant luminescence of some of its species.\r\nThese are the click-beetles, or Elaterids (see Fig. 22, C). In South\r\nAmerica there are upwards of a hundred species of this group, showing\r\nvarious degrees of luminosity. The \"Cucujos\" (Pyrophorus noctilucus) of\r\ntropical America is one of the most abundant and largest. It is as much\r\nas an inch and a half long, and has three \"lamps,\" or luminous organs,\r\none on each side of the body and one below the tail. The light given\r\noff is extremely beautiful, and the live insects are used by the women\r\nfor ornament and by the country-folk as lamps on nocturnal excursions.\r\nErroneously the term \"fire-fly\" is applied to these beetles; it should\r\nbe reserved for the little Italian Luciola, which swarms, as countless\r\nthousands of dancing lights, in the nights of early summer over the\r\nmarsh lands of North Italy. I have seen it at the end of June as far\r\nnorth as Bonn, on the Rhine. In Australia a small true \"fly\"[7]--that\r\nis to say, a two-winged fly or Dipteron like our gnats, midges, and\r\nhouse-flies--is known, the maggot of which is luminous. And in New\r\nZealand there is another of which both the maggot and the perfect\r\ninsect are luminous. The grub is called the New Zealand glow-worm.[8]\r\n\r\n[7] Known to entomologists as Ceroplatus mastersi.\r\n\r\n[8] Boletophila luminosa of entomologists.\r\n\r\nThere are grounds for believing that the luminescence of some of these\r\ninsects serves them not to attract one another, but to scare would-be\r\npredatory foes, such as birds, bats, and reptiles. I have heard a story\r\n(which I should like to have confirmed) that in some part of tropical\r\nAsia a certain kind of bird collects half a dozen or so of a species\r\nof glow-worm and places them at the entrance to its nest, so as to\r\nscare nocturnal animals which might attack its eggs or its young. It\r\nis a noteworthy fact that a point of light in the dark may act in two\r\nopposite ways on animals which see it--either it attracts or it repels\r\nthem. The physiologist calls this positive and negative \"photo-taxis\"\r\n(light-guidance). And we have the similarly positive and negative\r\ninfluence of chemical taste and smell, called \"chemo-taxis,\" and a\r\nsimilarly contrasted positive and negative \"hygrotaxis,\" or directive\r\ninfluence of moisture upon the movements of animals and plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nFROM APE TO MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE recent discoveries of the actual bones of very early races of man\r\nraise again a general interest in the inquiry as to what are the actual\r\ndifferences of structure between men and apes, and what were probably\r\nthe steps by which, as the result of \"survival of the fittest,\" some\r\nearly man-like apes became ape-like men. The question also arises as\r\nto how long ago the transition actually took place, and whether it was\r\na very gradual or a rapid one. We are to-day in possession of some\r\nimportant facts bearing upon this inquiry which were unknown to Huxley\r\nwhen he wrote his ever-memorable essay on \"Man's Place in Nature,\" and\r\ntriumphantly closed the controversy between himself and Sir Richard\r\nOwen. That was nearly fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nOwen had maintained that the structural difference between man and\r\nthe highest apes was so great that it could only be rightly expressed\r\nby placing man in a separate sub-class of the class \"Mammalia\"--the\r\nhairy vertebrate animals which have warm blood and suckle their\r\nyoung. He pointed chiefly to the large size of the brain in man, the\r\nexistence on each side of its central cavity of a little internal\r\nswelling called the \"hippocampus minor,\" in the fanciful language of\r\nanatomists, and of the overlapping (within the skull) of the cerebellum\r\nby the hinder part of the large brain-hemispheres, or cerebrum. He\r\ncalled the sub-class (in which he proposed to place man alone) the\r\n\"archencephala,\" or that of the highest developed brains (Greek,\r\n\"archi,\" chief, and \"encephalon,\" a brain), and proposed three other\r\nsub-classes, to contain the other orders of mammals (the Gyrencephala,\r\nLissencephala, and Lyencephala), grouped according to three grades\r\nof complexity of the brain. Huxley denied the justification of this\r\nspecial grouping, by which man was placed in a separate and highest\r\nsub-class apart from the apes and monkeys. He pointed out that every\r\nbone and every part recognized by the anatomist in the higher apes is\r\npresent in man (though other mammals present no such identity with him\r\nor them), and that there are only three little muscles belonging to\r\nthe hand and the foot which are present in man and not present in the\r\nhigher apes. He showed that the term \"four-handed,\" or \"quadrumanous,\"\r\nas applied to the apes and monkeys, is misleading, inasmuch as, though\r\nmodified in the proportions of the digits and the mobility of the\r\ngreat toe, the foot of the apes has the same bones and muscles as the\r\nfoot of man, and differs in structure from their hand as the foot of\r\nman differs from his hand, whilst the true hand of the apes agrees in\r\nstructure with the hand of man.\r\n\r\nHuxley (supported by many other anatomists) also showed conclusively\r\nthat the little lobe in the interior of the brain called the\r\n\"hippocampus minor\" is present in the apes as in man, and that the\r\nposterior part of the greater brain, or \"cerebrum,\" does overlap the\r\n\"cerebellum\" in apes and many monkeys to an even greater extent than\r\nit does in man. Owen's statements on this matter appear to have been\r\ndue to his reliance on specimens of apes' brains removed from the\r\nskull and badly preserved in spirit--in which condition the parts in\r\nquestion had slipped out of their natural position. Owen's statements\r\nwere thus fully demonstrated to be contrary to the fact, and Huxley\r\ndeclared, and conclusively showed, that so far from being entitled, on\r\nanatomical grounds, to a separate sub-class, man differs less from the\r\nhigher apes--the four animals known as the gorilla, the chimpanzee,\r\nthe orang-utan, and the gibbon--than does any one of these differ from\r\nthe lower monkeys. Huxley came, therefore, to the conclusion that man\r\ncould not logically be dissociated from the apes and monkeys in the\r\nway proposed by Owen, and that he should be placed with them in one\r\n\"order,\" to which the name \"Primates\" (pronounced as three syllables,\r\nand having no reference to the clergy of the Anglican Church) is\r\napplied. This name was given by the great naturalist Linnæus, one\r\nhundred and fifty years ago, to the same group, in which, however, he\r\nerroneously included also the bats.\r\n\r\nIt was distinctly pointed out by Huxley, and has been maintained by all\r\nthose who have since occupied themselves with the matter, that there\r\nare certain very obvious differences between man and the highest ape,\r\nor that which comes nearest to him in the largest number of important\r\nfeatures--the gorilla. The chimpanzee is practically, for the purpose\r\nof such a comparison, very nearly identical with the gorilla. Both are\r\ninhabitants of tropical Africa, whilst the next nearest, the orang\r\nand the gibbons, are inhabitants of tropical Asia. The differences\r\nseparating man from these near kindred animals are differences of the\r\nsize and proportion of structures present in them all, and are not due\r\nto the existence in man of actual parts or structures which are present\r\nin him and not present in these apes. Man has developed from the ape,\r\nnot by the production of any new organ or part, but by the definite\r\nmodification of parts already present in the apes. Even that obscure\r\ninternal worm-like outgrowth of the intestine, called the \"vermiform\r\nappendix,\" which has become so unhappily familiar to the general public\r\nof late years on account of its frequent ulceration and the consequent\r\ndanger to life, is present in full size in those higher apes which I\r\nhave cited by name, and is present in them and man alone amongst all\r\nthe varied members of the class of mammals until we come to the little\r\nAustralian beaver-like \"wombat,\" which has a vermiform appendix or\r\nnarrowed tube-like extremity to the intestinal sac, called the cæcum,\r\nlike that of man and the higher apes.\r\n\r\nThe changes of bodily form and proportions noticeable when we compare\r\nman with the gorilla or the chimpanzee are precisely those which fit in\r\nwith the supposition of a gradual change of form and habits favoured by\r\nnatural selection in the struggle for existence of ape-like creatures\r\nliving originally in tropical forests, but gradually spreading beyond\r\nthe special conditions of tropical life into other conditions and\r\nseeking to hold their own and to nourish themselves and their young.\r\nThey have had to contend with one another for food and safety and to\r\ndefend themselves either by violence or by craft against predatory\r\nanimals and competitors of all kinds.\r\n\r\nThere are certain notions still current dating from Roman times as\r\nto differences between man and apes, which are simply erroneous and\r\nfanciful in origin. Thus, at one time the possession of a tail was\r\nsupposed to separate animals, including monkeys and apes, from man.\r\nThe rare abnormal cases in which the end of the vertebral column of\r\nman is free and projects as a tail, were, a couple of hundred years\r\nago, cited with wonder and head-shakings as a proof that there was,\r\nafter all, a real similarity in man's structure to that of animals,\r\nand pictures of the \"Homo caudatus,\" or tailed man, were to be found\r\nin ancient books dealing with marvels and mysteries. As a matter of\r\nfact, three or four small insignificant vertebræ, almost immovable, are\r\nalways present in man attached to the great bone called the sacrum,\r\nformed by the union of five vertebræ. These small vertebræ, to which\r\nthe name \"coccyx\" is applied, are sunk beneath the skin and fat, at the\r\nend of the backbone, and though they correspond to bones of the tail of\r\nother animals, they are, in normal mankind, thus concealed from view.\r\nPrecisely the same atrophy and concealment of the bones of the tail is\r\nfound in the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and gibbons. They are all of\r\nthem, seen in the flesh, as tail-less as man is, and seen in skeleton\r\nhave precisely the same number of minute tail bones forming a \"coccyx.\"\r\nThis is true not only of the higher apes mentioned, but of the Barbary\r\nape--which lives at Gibraltar--whilst others, such as the mandrill,\r\nhave very short tails. In fact, the tail is a very variable appendage\r\nin monkeys, and, as the Manx breed shows, also in cats. It is mainly\r\n\"decorative\" in the old-world monkeys, and is probably maintained by\r\nsexual selection. It is only in the new-world monkeys that it has\r\nacquired obvious mechanical value. In them it is prehensile, and is\r\nused with great effect in swinging among the trees from branch to\r\nbranch, whilst the hands and feet are left free to grasp any new\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nAnother feature which is commonly, but erroneously, supposed to\r\nconstitute a great difference between man and apes is the hairiness\r\nof the latter. This is only a difference of degree, for the whole\r\nsurface of the body of man, excepting the eyelids, lips, palms of the\r\nhands, and soles of the feet, is covered by hair, as it is, with the\r\nsame exceptions, in the apes. It is true that the hair is very fine\r\nand small on most parts of the body of man and longer on the head.\r\nBut there are races of men (the Ainos of Japan and the pygmies of the\r\nUpper Nile) in which the hair on the body is coarser and more uniformly\r\ndistributed than in others, and there are individuals of exceptional\r\n\"hairiness\" in all races of man. Moreover, before birth a coat of\r\nrelatively coarse and abundant hair, called the \"lanugo,\" is shed by\r\nthe human fœtus. One variety of chimpanzee is practically bald--that\r\nis to say, has no obvious hair on the cranial region of the head. The\r\ncelebrated \"Sally,\" who lived so long in the Zoological Gardens in\r\nLondon, was one of this variety. When she died, I placed her brain, a\r\nremarkable one, in the museum at Oxford. Thus we see that neither tail\r\nnor hairiness separates apes from men.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the notion that animals, and therefore apes, do not and\r\ncannot laugh is erroneous. Many animals, including chimpanzees, laugh.\r\nThese men-like apes also sing and dance and utter sounds (as do\r\nlower monkeys) which have definite meaning, though those sounds are\r\nvery few in number and variety, and are separated by a long period\r\nof elaboration (both of skill in vocalization and in the mental\r\ndevelopment necessary to give significance to the sounds produced),\r\nfrom what we call \"human language\"--even from the speech of the most\r\nprimitive of existing men.\r\n\r\nIt is often assumed as a matter of prejudice--with the intention of\r\nmarking off the animal world to which the apes belong, from ourselves,\r\nthe human race--that the apes show little intelligence, reasoning\r\npower, and constructive aptitudes, which might serve as the beginning\r\nof man's arts and crafts, were man derived by a slow process of\r\ndevelopment from ape-like animals of a long past geologic period. The\r\nfact is that there has been very little opportunity for studying the\r\ncapacities of apes in regard to such matters, since when kept in cages\r\nthey have not the opportunity of showing the skill and understanding\r\nwhich in their natural conditions would be obvious. The monkeys show\r\n(and this has been especially observed in the chimpanzee), in a degree\r\ngreater than is seen in other animals, the mental quality which we call\r\n\"curiosity.\" And this is combined with a persistence and determination\r\nin observation and in experiment with the purpose of satisfying that\r\ncuriosity which is rarely, if ever, exhibited by other animals to\r\nanything like the same extent.\r\n\r\nThe higher apes will use their fingers to turn the screws which fasten\r\ndown the lid of a box in order to see what is inside. Lately the\r\nlarge orang in the Zoological Gardens of London succeeded, after long\r\nefforts, in unwinding the wire fastenings of its cage and escaping\r\ninto the open. It climbed into a tree, and immediately constructed\r\nfor itself a platform of branches which it broke off from the tree.\r\nIt then sat upon this platform, as is its habit when in its native\r\nforest. Many of the larger monkeys have great skill in throwing stones,\r\nsending them with considerable force and good aim. They select stones\r\nof size and weight appropriate to their purpose, and it would not be\r\nsurprising should apes have learnt to select stones for other purposes,\r\nsuch as cracking nuts or the shells of molluscs, in order to extract\r\nthe soft nourishing food which they contain. They are known to make\r\nuse of stones for such purposes, and it would be but a short step in\r\nadvance for them to choose one suitable for use as a hammer, and\r\nanother suitable for use as a piercing or cutting tool. And from such a\r\nstage there is a gradual and easy passage to the simplest breaking and\r\npreparation of stones for use--in fact, to the earliest fabrication of\r\n\"implements.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious when we compare not only the structure but what we know\r\nof the ways and habits of the lowest savages and the highest apes,\r\nthat it is not by mere strength, swiftness, or agility that man has\r\nflourished and established himself, leaving the apes far behind him as\r\n\"inferior\" creatures, though as a matter of fact he is not deficient\r\nin these qualities. It is by his observation, knowledge, memory, and\r\npurposive skill that he has succeeded, and it is easy to point out a\r\nwhole series of modifications of form separating man from apes, which\r\nare clearly contributory to the development of the mental qualities\r\nwhich give him his actual superiority. I think we are justified in\r\ntaking the large opposable thumb and fingers as the starting-point\r\nin man's emergence from the ape stage of his ancestry. The exploring\r\nhand, with its thumb and forefinger, is the great instrument by which\r\nthe intelligence, first of the monkey and then of man, has been\r\ndeveloped. The thumb of the gorilla is, in proportion to the size of\r\nthe fingers, very much smaller than that of man, but bigger than that\r\nof the chimpanzee, and much bigger than that of the orang and of lower\r\nmonkeys. It is evident that the thumb has increased in size in the\r\nman-like apes, and in man himself this increase has been carried much\r\nfurther, and led to the perfecting of the hand as an instrument of\r\nexploration and construction. Contributory to the perfecting of the\r\nhand has been the gradual attainment of the upright carriage, and the\r\nuse of the feet alone for walking, and the reservation of the hand for\r\ndelicate exploring operations, and the bringing of objects near to the\r\neye, to the nose, the ear, and the mouth for investigation by the great\r\norgans of special sense. The foot has become \"plantigrade\" in connexion\r\nwith the assumption of upright carriage. It has independently become\r\nplantigrade in the gibbons and the baboons. That is to say, we and they\r\ndo not walk on the edge of the half-grasping foot as do the gorilla,\r\nchimpanzee, and orang, but more steadily and firmly on its flat sole\r\n(plantar surface), as do the bears and some other animals. At the same\r\ntime man has lost very greatly (but not entirely) the power of grasping\r\nwith his toes. The upright carriage enabled the early ancestors of man\r\nto survey, and so to judge the conditions of safety or danger at a\r\ndistance from them, as well as to devote their hands to new and special\r\nuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE SKELETON OF APES AND OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE upright carriage of man has entailed remarkable changes in the\r\nproportions and shapes of parts of his body, as well as leading to\r\nspecial skill in the use of his hands. The vertebral column of man has\r\nnot the single curve of a bow, as it has (practically) in the higher\r\napes, but as he stands it curves (slightly, it is true, but definitely)\r\nforward at the neck, backward at the chest, forward at the loins, and\r\nbackward again at the hips, an arrangement which appears to protect to\r\nsome extent the brain from the transmission to it along the vertebral\r\ncolumn of the shock caused by the sudden impact of the feet on the\r\nground in jumping. The head is balanced on the top of this slightly\r\nelastic curvilinear column, the joint by which the skull rests on the\r\nvertebræ being placed beneath the brain-box and near the middle region\r\nof the skull. The ligaments which hold the skull in place are smaller\r\nthan those in monkeys. In the higher apes the skull is not so balanced,\r\nbut is held by very strong ligaments and muscles braced, as it were,\r\non to the end of the forwardly sloping, nearly straight, backbone,\r\nfrom which it projects, and has further to be held in position by a\r\ngreat ligament attached to it and the dorsal processes of the neck\r\nvertebræ. As an adaptation to the upright carriage of man, the shape\r\nof his pelvic bones is that of a basin upon which his coiled mass\r\nof intestines can rest when he stands erect. The pelvic bones of the\r\nhigher apes are flat, nearly parallel with the broad plane of the back,\r\nand give no such support; the viscera have to rest against the wall\r\nof the abdomen in the stooping position assumed by these animals in\r\nwalking. The abdominal walls are consequently strong and thick, and the\r\nabdomen protrudes, as does that of a very young child. One result of\r\nman's upright carriage, showing that it is a recent acquirement and one\r\nto which he is not completely adapted, is the frequent occurrence in\r\nhim of \"hernia,\" or protrusion of the intestine through certain spaces\r\nin the deep fibrous wall of the abdomen. There would be no excessive\r\npressure upon these spaces (near the groin), and therefore little\r\ndanger of hernia, were it not for man's newly-acquired habit of erect\r\ngait. He is still incompletely adapted to the upright pose.\r\n\r\nThe arms of man are relatively shorter and his legs much longer than\r\nin the man-like apes. The Neandermen were more ape-like in these\r\nproportions than are modern races of man, and show also an \"ape-like\"\r\ncurvature of the thigh bone which in man is straight. Whilst the arm\r\nand hand of man has gradually become a more delicate thing than that\r\nof the apes, and capable of much greater variety and efficiency in the\r\nmovements of its parts, this condition has come about by alteration\r\nin proportions and to some extent shape, and not by any great change\r\nin construction. Only two muscles exist in connexion with man's hand\r\nnot found in that of the higher apes. They are small slips adding to\r\nthe efficiency of the fingers and thumb, whilst in the foot there is\r\nin man a small muscle connected with its outer border--\"the peroneus\r\ntertius\"--which helps to keep the sole of the foot turned downwards,\r\nand is not present in the apes. The general shape and proportionate\r\nsize of the muscles of the leg in man give it a very different\r\nappearance from that of the ape; but there are no muscles or bones\r\npresent which are not found in the apes. The beautiful outline and form\r\nof the human leg and buttocks are directly the result of the increased\r\nsize of certain muscles used in maintaining the upright position,\r\nand in the peculiarly human swing of the leg in walking and running.\r\nTheir beauty, like that of the other specially human features which we\r\nconsider beautiful, depends upon the fact that their development, in\r\ndue proportion, is a necessary condition of efficiency, activity, and\r\nstrength in movements and attitudes which have gradually been acquired\r\nby man, and distinguish him from the apes. Our admiration for them is\r\na sort of self-love, a worship of an ideal of efficiency and balance\r\nwhich is specifically \"human,\" and is more or less fully realized in\r\nevery individual. Probably sexual selection has had a large share in\r\nthus moulding the human form. The apes do not present the development\r\nof the gluteal region characteristic of man, and the muscles of both\r\nthe arms and legs in them are, though very powerful, less fleshy and\r\nmore \"stringy\" than those of man. There is, indeed, a difference\r\nof \"quality\" in the muscles of apes and men, especially civilized\r\nmen, which needs investigation by the microscopist and experimental\r\nphysiologist.\r\n\r\nThough we necessarily compare man with the highest existing apes, we\r\nmust not suppose that the man-like ape from which the earliest ape-like\r\nmen developed was in fact a gorilla or a chimpanzee. The survival\r\nof the gorilla and chimpanzee at this day necessarily implies that\r\nthey were not the actual ancestral forms which became modified and\r\nsuperseded in the course of man's development. Very probably the ape\r\n(the creature more ape-like than man-like, of which more anon) from\r\nwhich man took his direct descent had already developed a plantigrade\r\nfoot--that is a foot of which the sole is placed on the ground for\r\nsupport, as it is in gibbons, baboons, and bears, but not in most apes,\r\nnor in cats, dogs, sheep, and horses! And probably the hands of that\r\nancestral ape were already used more dexterously in consequence, and\r\nthe dog teeth were less needed either in fighting or in breaking up\r\nfood and so had become smaller.\r\n\r\nThis reflection brings us to the differences between the teeth of a\r\nman and those of apes. The face of apes is drawn forward so as to\r\napproach in form the \"muzzle\" of a dog. It is far less muzzle-like\r\nin the more man-like apes than in the dog-faced baboons, and in the\r\nleast civilized living races of man is much less prominent--what is\r\ncalled \"prognathous\"--than in the highest existing apes. In civilized\r\nliving races of man it is markedly reduced, so that in the habitual\r\ncarriage of the head, with the eyes looking forward over a horizontal\r\nplane at right angles to the vertical or upright body, the front\r\nborder of the jaws, in which the chisel-like incisor teeth are set,\r\nusually projects but very little beyond the brow or forehead. In Greek\r\nsculpture and other examples regarded by us as types of \"beauty,\" the\r\njaws do not project at all. Such a face is called \"orthognathous.\"\r\nThis modification of the shape of the face is due to the progressive\r\ndwindling in the size of the front part of the jaw and its teeth in\r\nthe series dog, ape, less-civilized man, highly-civilized man, and is\r\naccompanied by an increase in the size of the front part of the brain.\r\nThe number of the teeth and their arrangement in groups are identical\r\nin man and the apes. The most important difference is in the size of\r\nthe front teeth, and especially in the size of the \"corner\" teeth (one\r\non each side above and below), also called eye-teeth, dog-teeth, or\r\n\"canines.\" In the highest apes, as in all monkeys, the canine teeth\r\nare very large, and even tusk-like in the males, projecting above the\r\nhorizonal line formed by the crowns of the other teeth. This projecting\r\nof the canine teeth results in their not meeting one another point\r\nto point when the jaws are closed, but necessitates one, the lower,\r\nshutting in front of the other, and a space is left in the row of\r\nteeth, both in the upper and the lower jaw, for this interlocking of\r\nthe great canines. It is called a \"diastema.\" Man stands in strong\r\ncontrast to the apes in this respect. His canines do not project beyond\r\nthe level of the neighbouring teeth, and there is no \"diastema\" or gap\r\nin either the upper or lower row of his teeth.[9] There is no trace of\r\nsuch a gap nor any excess of size of the canines in any living race of\r\nmen, and what is more remarkable, the jaws of very ancient prehistoric\r\nmen which have been found in the Middle Pleistocene--the Neander or\r\nMoustierian men as well as the more ancient jaw from Heidelberg (see p.\r\n286)--do not show any difference in this respect from the most advanced\r\nEuropean race. On the other hand, it is one of the most remarkable\r\nfeatures presented by the recently discovered \"Piltdown\" lower jaw that\r\nit had a larger canine tooth than that of any recent or fossil man, and\r\nconsequently a gap or \"diastema\" in the row of teeth (see Chap. XXX).\r\nThis difference between men and apes is all the more marked since the\r\ngrinders or cheek teeth (called also molars) of man and the higher\r\napes agree very closely, each to each in order of their position, in\r\nthe pattern formed by the irregular surface of the crown. There are\r\nsome slight differences in relative size and in the order of their\r\n\"cutting\" or growth, but these are trivial. The jaws of man show their\r\nderivation by gradual dwindling from the larger projecting jaws seen\r\nin apes and monkeys, in the close setting (that is to say, \"crowding\")\r\nof the teeth, and also in the dwindling and late \"cutting\" of the last\r\ntooth, in each jaw above and below, which we call the wisdom tooth.\r\nThe \"wisdom teeth\" are in the higher races of men on their way to\r\ntotal disappearance. In lower races of men they are larger than in the\r\nhigher, and in the man-like apes are of full size, and there is plenty\r\nof room in the jaw for them.\r\n\r\n[9] See Plates VII. and VIII., p. 166, in \"Science from an Easy Chair,\"\r\nSecond Series, for careful drawings of the complete series of teeth in\r\nboth the upper and lower jaw of Man and of an Ape.\r\n\r\nIn the highest apes as well as the lower, the bony lower jaw slopes\r\ngradually backwards and downwards from the _palisade_ of front\r\nchisel-like teeth or incisors (see Fig. 23 C, p. 277). There is no\r\nbony projection below the front teeth--in fact, no bony \"chin.\" But\r\nin all modern races of men the front part of the semicircle arch of\r\nteeth has shrunk or \"withdrawn\" considerably or more than has the\r\nbony jaw in which the teeth are set. Consequently the bone projects\r\nin front of the front teeth as the bony chin (see Fig. 23 A, p. 277,\r\nand also \"Science from an Easy Chair,\" 1910, pp. 404, 405). This is\r\ncharacteristic of modern races of man and occurs in no other animal.\r\nThe very remarkable fact has recently been established that in the\r\nancient species of man from the Middle and Lower Pleistocene--the\r\nNeander man and the Heidelberg man (Homo Neanderthalensis)--this extra\r\nor excessive shrinking of the dental arch (the half-circle formed by\r\nthe complete row of teeth) had not taken place. Though the teeth are\r\nplaced closely side by side and have the same shape as in modern man,\r\nthey are a little bigger and form a larger and longer arch--more like a\r\nhorse-shoe than a semicircle, and have not shrunk back so as to leave a\r\nprojecting bony chin. The bony jaw _recedes_ in these early races of\r\nmen from the line of the front teeth as it does in the apes. _They have\r\nno chin_ (see Fig. 25, p. 286).\r\n\r\nSince we are all accustomed to regard a well-marked chin as a necessary\r\nfeature of a beautiful human face, and to deplore or disapprove the\r\nreceding or evanescent chin, it is not improbable that sexual selection\r\nhas favoured the recession of the dental arch with the retention of the\r\noriginal bulk of the lower front margin of the jaw and chin, though\r\nwhy the chin should be thus appreciated is a matter of speculation. It\r\nis remarkable that in many of the monkeys the hair grows forward as\r\na projecting beard on the front of the jaw, so as to resemble a chin\r\nalthough no chin is there. It is also the fact that some uncivilized\r\nraces of men trim the beard and train it in a forward growth so as to\r\nsuggest the possession of a very prominent chin, when in reality their\r\nsolid chins of flesh and bone are not especially large.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to suggest how the reduction in size of the canines and\r\nfront teeth and of the length of the jaw could be of such advantage\r\nto incipient man as to lead to the survival of those individuals\r\nin which these parts were least developed, and so gradually to the\r\ncrowding of the teeth, reduced in size, into a jaw of reduced length,\r\nwhilst at a late stage, long after man was man and no ape, the teeth\r\nbecame so reduced in volume as to leave the lower margin of the lower\r\njaw--projecting far in front of them as the \"chin,\" the eminently\r\nhuman chin. The nutrition of these parts placed in the head near the\r\nbrain, the great canine having so vast a fang that it reaches up to the\r\neye-socket, whence it is called the \"eye-tooth,\" renders it probable\r\nthat there is a relation depending on nutrition and blood supply\r\nbetween them and that all-important organ contained in the neighbouring\r\nbony box, the brain. As the great teeth and long jaw have dwindled, the\r\nbrain has increased in volume, and, what is more important, in activity.\r\n\r\nOther neighbouring bony structures have dwindled whilst the brain\r\nhas increased. The great longitudinal and transverse crests of bone\r\nseen on the skull of the gorilla may never have existed in that form\r\nof ape from which man is derived, but a tendency to such ridge-like\r\noutgrowth and to a greater thickness of the bony wall of the brain-case\r\ncharacterizes apes as distinguished from men, and its disappearance\r\nis one of the changes which have accompanied the expansion of the\r\nbrain-case and the increased size of brain in man. Lower races of\r\nexisting men have frequently thicker skulls than the higher races.\r\nThe bony development of the skull in the higher apes is especially\r\nremarkable in the region just above the eye. The upper border of the\r\norbit is greatly thickened, and projects as a bony arch overhanging the\r\neye. But the extent of this growth, as also of crests on the skull,\r\nvaries in individuals, and is much smaller in females than in males. In\r\nthe young these ridges and prominences are absent. It is accordingly no\r\nvery great change that they should disappear altogether in man, even\r\nwere they as large in the ape-like ancestor of man, which probably\r\nthey were not. But the existence of a considerable thickening and\r\nforward growth of the eyebrow region of the skull is noticed in many\r\nhuman skulls. It is particularly large in some skulls of Australian\r\n\"black-fellows,\" and is still larger in and characteristic of the\r\nancient species of men of the Moustierian period in Europe, Homo\r\nNeanderthalensis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE BRAIN OF APES AND OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nA GREAT and undoubtedly very important difference between man and apes\r\nis the much greater size of the brain in man. This difference is most\r\nconveniently measured by filling the cavity of a skull, once occupied\r\nby the brain, with shot or other such material, and then measuring the\r\nbulk of the material required for that purpose. The unit which it is\r\nconvenient to use in all such measurements is the cubic centimetre,\r\nbecause it is that used by scientific workers all over the world. A\r\ncubic centimetre is a cube the side of which is a centimetre long, and\r\ntwo and a half centimetres are equal to one inch. Moreover, if ever\r\none is doubtful as to just how much an inch is, one has only to get\r\nhold of a halfpenny and mark off its breadth on a piece of paper. That\r\nis an inch, and two-fifths of it are a centimetre. Using, then, cubic\r\ncentimetres as our units, we find that a good average European human\r\nbrain is of the bulk of 1500 units. The gorilla has a slightly larger\r\nbrain than the chimpanzee or the orang. Individual specimens differ a\r\ngood deal. This is noteworthy as showing a tendency of this important\r\norgan to vary. One of good medium bulk measures 500 units, or a third\r\nof that of the well-developed European. The size of European human\r\nbrains also varies within very large limits--about a third more and a\r\nthird less--that is, from about 1000 units to nearly 2000. Idiots have\r\nabnormally small brains which are often deformed. We leave them aside\r\nfor the moment. Healthy European adults have been measured with a brain\r\nof only 1000 units. Australian \"black-fellows\" have, it seems, in some\r\ncases a brain which measures as little as 900 units, but in others it\r\nreaches 1500. The skull of the fossil man from Pleistocene (possibly\r\nPliocene) gravels in Java (known as Pithecanthropus) had a capacity of\r\nonly 900 units.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose (as it is legitimate to do) that some specimens of\r\nthe gorilla may have a brain a third larger than the average we get\r\n670 units for the biggest gorilla brain, and if we similarly assume\r\nthat the primitive human race of the Java gravel varied to the same\r\nextent--namely, by a third more or less around 900 as the normal--we\r\nfind that the greatest size of the gorilla brain overlaps the smallest\r\nof the Javan Pithecanthropus, whilst the largest of that race would\r\noverlap not only the Australian but the smaller-sized brains of\r\nEuropeans. Hence, if we accept, as we must, the fact that the brain\r\nof man and the man-like apes naturally varies greatly in volume in\r\ndifferent individuals, there is no absolute gap in regard to size\r\nbetween the higher races of man and the apes. The difference is bridged\r\nover by the lower races of man and the exceptional individuals of apes.\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature in regard to man's brain is its growth. Since\r\nit is contained in a bony box, which in the adult is firmly ossified\r\nand incapable of expansion, it is obvious that the brain, too, must\r\ncease growing when the bony box has closed in. In the apes this\r\noccurs at an earlier age than in man. The brain-box has its sides\r\nand roof constituted by a number of platelike pieces of bone, which\r\nincrease in area by addition to their margins, and finally meet each\r\nother and grow into one another, forming an irregular notched line of\r\njunction, which is called a \"suture.\" The sutures themselves are often\r\nobliterated by bony deposit in mature life. In man the bony plates of\r\nthe skull are separated by large membranous interspaces at birth--\"the\r\nfontanelles\"--and by delay in the junction of the bony pieces the\r\nexpansion of the brain is permitted. About one-fourth of the cases\r\nof idiocy reported upon by medical observers are accompanied by an\r\nunusually small size of the brain-case (as small in some cases as 750\r\nunits), due to the premature closure of its bony walls at an unusually\r\nearly period of growth. It, indeed, seems (though this is a suggestion\r\nrather than a demonstrated conclusion) that the increase of the size\r\nof the brain in normal men, as compared with apes, and the consequent\r\ndevelopment of increased mental capacity in man, may be directly set up\r\nby a delay in the ossification of the walls of the brain-case in man,\r\nas compared with his ape-like progenitors.\r\n\r\nOne of the most definite distinctions between present man and\r\nthe higher apes is the length of time during which the period of\r\ngrowth--namely, \"childhood\"--and the subsequent adolescent stage of\r\ndevelopment is prolonged. The chimpanzee \"Sally\" was full-grown and\r\nadult at eight years of age. Savage races show maturity at an age which\r\nseems to Europeans astonishing--sometimes as early as the eleventh\r\nyear. But even within the European area there is great variation\r\nin this matter, the Southern people maturing more rapidly than the\r\nNorthern. There certainly is a tendency in modern civilization to\r\ndefer the recognition of emergence from childhood, though whether\r\nthe physical facts of growth and maturity of structure justify such\r\na delay is not obvious. The history of our schools and universities\r\nand the records as to the age at which marriage takes place bear\r\nevidence of this modern increase of the duration of adolescence. In\r\nany case, whether the prolongation of the period of physical growth\r\nand development is even now still being increased, it is certain that\r\nthe extension has taken place in former ages, and that the mental\r\ndevelopment of man is directly related in the first place to this\r\nincreased period of growth, and in the second place to the prolongation\r\nof the period of organized \"education\" directed by the elder\r\ngeneration. The brain of the human child at four years of age may not\r\ninfrequently reach as much as 1300 units in volume--more than double\r\nthat of a full-grown gorilla--and it continues to increase in volume\r\nfor some eight years, though it is difficult to say precisely when the\r\ninterlocking of the bony pieces of the skull reaches a point when they\r\ncan no longer yield to the expansion of the brain. The increase of the\r\ncavity of the skull practically ceases in childhood, and the increase\r\nin the size of the head subsequently is due to the increased size of\r\nmuscles and fibrous structures on the outer surface of the brain-box.\r\nTrue as it is that man's brain is much larger than that of the higher\r\napes, it is also true that the difference is far greater between the\r\nhigher apes and the lower monkeys both as to the size of the brain and\r\nthe complexity of the folds and furrows which mark the surface of the\r\ncerebral hemispheres. In these respects, as in every other anatomical\r\nfeature, as was insisted by Huxley, there is less difference between\r\nman and the higher apes than between the higher apes and the lower\r\nmonkeys, so that there is no pretext for placing man in a group apart\r\nfrom the apes and monkeys or for suggesting the existence of any great\r\nstructural chasm between man and apes; on the contrary, their likeness\r\nin all important details of structure is very close.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of the size of the brain in various cases which has just\r\nbeen made is one of absolute size, leaving out of consideration the\r\nsize and weight of the body and limbs. Putting aside the exceptional\r\npygmy races of man (which there is no reason to regard as primitive),\r\nthe average adult man is larger and heavier than the chimpanzee, and\r\ntaller than, though not so powerful as, the orang. The gibbons are\r\nquite small--rarely 3 feet in height--but the male gorilla is, when\r\nadult, a much heavier animal than man, and often measures 5 feet 8\r\ninches from the heel to the top of the head. Recently even larger\r\nspecimens have been measured, and 6 feet 6 inches is quoted (probably\r\nan over-estimate) as the height attained by some specimens. This fact\r\nremoves any difficulty about comparing the absolute size of brain in\r\nman and these apes. It also renders it unlikely that the primitive\r\nape-men or men-apes were smaller than modern men, whilst the large size\r\nand weight of some of the earliest \"shaped\" flints (of Pliocene age)\r\nattributed to primitive man, make it probable that the men who used\r\nthese flints were larger and more powerful, at any rate in the hands\r\nand arms, than modern races of men. Size and strength are, then, not\r\npoints which offer any difficulty in the passage from ape to man.\r\n\r\nWhat (it may well be asked) is the significance of man's greater brain?\r\nWhat was the advantage to man's ape-like progenitors in an increased\r\nvolume of brain? It should be noted at once that the pattern of the\r\n\"convolutions\" marked out on the surface of the brain by a great\r\nseries of winding \"ditches\" or \"furrows\" is based on one common plan\r\nin the group of monkeys and man--a plan differing from that seen in\r\nother groups which have a convoluted brain-surface--for instance from\r\nthat seen in the carnivora (dogs, bears, and cats) and again from\r\nthat seen in the ungulates (hoofed mammals). The convolutions of the\r\nbrain of the higher apes have been minutely compared with those of\r\nman's brain. The two sets of convolutions agree very closely, but are\r\nless extensive in the apes and certain small tracts of convolutions\r\npresent in man, are deficient in the apes, especially in the frontal\r\nregion and at the hinder or occipital region. We know very little of\r\nthe exact significance of each region of convolution in the brain.\r\nThe existence of convolutions separated by furrows clearly enough\r\nincreases the amount of surface of the brain, which consists of a\r\ngrey substance called \"the cortex of the brain,\" and is known to be\r\na peculiar and specially active material. The mere comparison of the\r\nsize and height of the frontal region in different animals and in man\r\njustifies the conclusion that an increase of this part of the brain\r\nis more especially related to increased intelligence. Further, the\r\nfacts derived from observation of the consequences of disease or of\r\nmechanical injury in man have led to the conclusion that the \"faculty\r\nof language\" (the significant use of words, not the mere production\r\nof them as sounds) is especially connected with one of the frontal\r\nconvolutions, which is feebly represented in the apes. The convolutions\r\nof the brain of lower races of men have not been very fully studied,\r\nbut the brain of a Hottentot woman was long ago carefully described\r\nand illustrated, showing less complexity of the convolutions than is\r\nusual in European man, and making a distinct approach in this respect\r\nto the apes; but still possessing in fair proportion the convolutions\r\ncharacteristic of the human brain.\r\n\r\nAbundance of convolutions and their increase at this or that part of\r\nthe brain must, it is obvious, increase the active brain substance.\r\nBut there is some evidence of a special kind as to the significance\r\nof increased bulk of the entire brain, apart from the folding of its\r\nsurface. This is afforded by the brain cavities of the skulls observed\r\nin the series of vertebrate animals. The older groups--those \"lower,\"\r\nthat is farthest removed from man and the animals most like him--have\r\nin proportion to the bulk of their bodies much smaller brains than\r\nthe later-developed groups. Thus fishes have smaller brains than\r\nreptiles, and these have much smaller brains than mammals. A cod-fish\r\nhas in proportion to its bulk of living material a smaller brain than\r\na crocodile or a turtle, and these have a much smaller brain than a\r\npig. Not only so, but earlier kinds of mammals than the pig have a\r\nsmaller brain proportionately than that animal has, and pigs have a\r\nsmaller brain in proportion to their bulk than monkeys, and monkeys\r\n(as we have seen) a smaller brain than man. This increase of size is,\r\nin general, proportionate to an increase in the variety and complexity\r\nof the control of the movements of the body and their relation to the\r\nactivities of the great organs of sense, such as the eyes, and the\r\norgans of smell and hearing.\r\n\r\nBut there is something more involved in the increase of the brain\r\nthan this. We now know that the brain of very many kinds of animals\r\nhas been increasing in size in the later geological periods. Huge\r\nreptiles as big as elephants existed on the land surface of the\r\nglobe before the hairy, warm-blooded mammals which now dominate the\r\nsituation had developed in number or in size--namely, in the period of\r\nand before the chalk which geologists call the Mesozoic or secondary\r\nperiod, to distinguish it both from the tertiary period, when mammals\r\nwere abundant and large, and from the Palæozoic or primary period,\r\nat the end of which terrestrial vertebrates first began to make\r\ntheir appearance. These huge reptiles--such as the Iguanodon, the\r\nTriceratops, and the Diplodocus (all to be seen in skeleton, though\r\nnot in the flesh, at the Natural History Museum)--had brains of an\r\nincredibly small size, much smaller in proportion to their bulk than\r\nthose of living reptiles, such as lizards and crocodiles. The same\r\nextraordinary difference of size of brain is seen when we compare the\r\nlarge living mammals with their equally large extinct forerunners in\r\nthe early tertiary strata. The skulls and whole skeletons of great\r\nrhinoceros-like animals--some of them ancestrally related to our living\r\nrhinoceroses--are dug up in early tertiary sands and clays, which have\r\nabsurdly small brains. We can take a mould of the interior of the brain\r\ncases of these extinct animals and compare them with that of the recent\r\nrhinoceros. We find that the extinct animal's brain was in many cases\r\nonly one-eighth the bulk of that of its modern representative!\r\n\r\nThe same disproportion in the size of the more ancient animal's brain\r\nis found when we compare the brain of the modern horse with that of\r\nits early tertiary ancestors. The modern animal has, as a rule, a\r\nvery greatly increased size of brain when compared with its Miocene\r\nforefather. In fact, it seems that the brain has had, as it were, an\r\nindependent development in several lines of descent, and whilst the\r\nrest of the structure of the ancestral form has been only slightly\r\nmodified in its proportions, the brain cavity and the brain within it\r\nhas enormously increased. It is therefore not so exceptional a thing\r\nas it at first appears--but only an instance of a change more or less\r\nwidely exhibited among later animals, as compared with their near\r\nrelatives in the past--when we establish the fact that the brain of\r\nthe man-like apes is much bigger than that of lower monkeys, and that\r\nthe brain of man, who is so closely similar in all structural details\r\nto those apes, has attained to a bulk three times that of the ape. The\r\nvast increase in the size of the brain in recent animals, as compared\r\nwith their closely related representatives of an earlier period, is a\r\nfrequent and regular thing. It is possible to make a suggestion, of\r\nsome plausibility, as to the meaning and value of this increased size\r\nof brain, which will be found in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE MIND OF APES AND OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST as man's brain is enormously larger than that of the ordinary\r\nmonkeys, although his general make and anatomy is closely similar\r\nto theirs, so we find that the rhinoceros has an enormous brain as\r\ncompared with extinct rhinoceros-like animals, the predecessors and\r\nancestors of those now living. The extinct Titanotherium of the lower\r\nMiocene period managed to carry on its life in an efficient way and\r\nto hold its own for a considerable period with a brain which was only\r\none-eighth the bulk of that of a modern rhinoceros, as did other\r\nanimals in the past with even greater bodies and smaller brains. To get\r\nsome suggestion as to the significance of this fact we must, in however\r\nincomplete a way, distinguish some of the main features of the mental\r\nprocesses which go on in man and animals and have their \"seat\" in the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nDescartes and other philosophers have held that there is a great\r\ndifference in the mental processes of animals as compared with those of\r\nman in this, namely, that man is \"conscious,\" that is to say, conscious\r\nof himself as \"I,\" and, as it were, looks on at himself acting on and\r\nbeing acted on by surrounding existences, whilst (so it is assumed)\r\nanimals have not this consciousness, but are \"automata,\" going through\r\nall the processes of life, and even behaving more or less as man does\r\nin similar circumstances, yet without being \"conscious.\" It is, no\r\ndoubt, true that many of the complicated actions of insects are carried\r\non without consciousness of the purpose or significance of what they\r\nare doing. Such is the storing by certain wasps of smaller insects\r\nin carefully-cut chambers, to serve as food for the wasp's young, to\r\nbe hatched from an egg to be laid in the \"cold-storage chamber.\" The\r\nmother wasp will go on doing this when she has had the hind part of\r\nher body removed and has no eggs to lay. This mechanical unreasoning\r\nbehaviour in insects is without exception, so that we must accept M.\r\nFabre's conclusion that they are, in fact, unconscious \"automata.\" I\r\nhave already referred to this subject in an earlier chapter, p. 197.\r\n\r\nWe at once place ourselves in difficulty in discussing this subject\r\nby the use of the words \"conscious\" and \"consciousness,\" for, as\r\nso often happens, they are customarily applied in a vague and\r\nuncertain way to the mental activities of man--without any precise\r\nagreement as to what is meant by either of them. We are all agreed\r\nthat a rational human being may go through a series of elaborate\r\nactions apparently directed by purpose and yet not be what we call\r\n\"conscious,\" that is to say, \"aware\" of what he is doing. This occurs\r\nin \"sleep-walking\" and in \"day-dreaming.\" And again, we know that a\r\nman may be evidently conscious during a certain period, and yet forget\r\ndirectly afterwards that he has been conscious and said and done\r\ncertain things during that period. This often happens after \"concussion\r\nof the brain.\" It is, as a matter of fact, uncertain whether one\r\nought to regard the condition of a man during that obliterated or\r\nforgotten period of seeming consciousness as rightly to be described\r\nby the term \"conscious.\" And the reason why one has this doubt is\r\nthat we all recognize that consciousness without memory is really\r\na contradiction in terms. Memory--the inscription or record in our\r\nbrains of past experiences--exists without consciousness, as we all\r\nknow, by observation of ourselves and our fellows. But the very\r\nessence of consciousness is memory. We cannot even be \"conscious\" of\r\nthe experience of a single moment without being also conscious of\r\nthe memory of some previous condition--however small, temporary, and\r\nincomplete the memory may be. To be conscious we must _compare_ the\r\nimpressions reaching the brain at this moment with the memory of those\r\nof a past moment. And in lower animals and infants beginning to be\r\nconscious, the \"recollections\" available or accessible to consciousness\r\nmay not extend farther back than a few seconds! If the memory of past\r\nexperiences of which we are aware, that is to say, which are accessible\r\nto consciousness, is large and extends over the impressions of days,\r\nweeks, and years, then the conscious man or animal is in a totally\r\ndifferent position from that of the man or animal who has only a very\r\nshort and vague memory of which he or it is conscious. Thus it may be\r\ntrue that an animal or an infant is \"conscious\" and is comparing the\r\npresent with the recollection of the past, and yet that the basis of\r\ncomparison--the reach of memory accessible to consciousness--is so\r\nsmall as to be of little or no significance. Yet it is the beginning\r\nof a process which, gradually enlarging the access of consciousness to\r\n\"memory,\" passes through a thousand degrees of increasing grasp and\r\ncomplexity (due to increased complexity in the microscopic connexions\r\nof the structural units, the branching nerve-corpuscles, which build up\r\nthe brain) until it gives us the \"consciousness\" of a Shakespeare, a\r\nNewton, or a Darwin. The important fact in this consideration of what\r\nwe mean by \"conscious\" and \"consciousness\" is, that memory is always\r\nfor most lower animals, and during a period of growth in man, untouched\r\nby consciousness, and much of it remains so in all of us. As the dawn\r\nlights up a distant peak and then another and then a whole range and\r\nspreads to valley and plain, giving greater detail and variety as the\r\nmoments pass--so does consciousness slowly invade in the course of\r\ndevelopment, whether of the individual or the species, the territory\r\nof memory. In the most man-like animals and the more ape-like men the\r\nprocess has not gone very far. In the highest apes consciousness is\r\nso limited in its access to memory that it is but a glimmer, a mere\r\nrudiment, of what it becomes in the modern races of mankind. We must\r\nnot overlook the fact that it is only when we have to deal with men far\r\nadvanced from the state of primeval savagery that the memory itself\r\nbecomes rich and varied. Observation, memory, and record--the vast\r\ntradition of taboo, knowledge, custom, law, and religion not inborn in\r\nour structure but handed on by spoken or written word--are developed\r\nand increased by the very fact that the daylight of consciousness has\r\nreached the memory of them when less copious than they become in later\r\ndevelopment, and has given them life-saving value.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt that consciousness--a beginning of\r\nit--exists in such animals as dogs and monkeys. And it is equally true\r\nthat man not only exists for some months after he is born without being\r\n\"conscious,\" but for some years is so only in disconnected intervals.\r\nAs a matter of fact, he is very incompletely \"conscious,\" even when\r\nadult. He is quite unconscious of a great many of his elaborate\r\nactions. He has, moreover, an \"unconscious memory\"--that is to say, a\r\nmemory of the existence of which he is not conscious--which guides\r\nhim to, and in, the most complicated proceedings, and astonishes\r\nhim when, by some chance, it is suddenly revealed to consciousness,\r\nor is converted into \"conscious memory,\" when he dreams. Every man\r\nfinds, sooner or later, that he has stored within him a register of\r\nthings, persons, and events of the existence of which he was totally\r\nunaware. The gradual development of \"consciousness\" in higher ape-like\r\nanimals and lower men, in the course of ages, is not the unparalleled\r\nthing which one is apt, at times, to consider it to be, since we can\r\nall remember the dawning of our own consciousness and its gradual\r\ndevelopment. We can also watch its growth in that most mysterious and\r\nwonderful casket of ancestral secrets and unfathomable destiny--a human\r\ninfant.\r\n\r\nInscrutable as is the ultimate nature of \"consciousness,\" we may put\r\nits further consideration aside on the present occasion, since it\r\nforms no actual barrier between men-like apes and ape-like men. On\r\nthe contrary, the higher apes, the lower living races of men and the\r\nchildren of higher races, furnish us with evidence of transition from\r\nthe lower condition of automatism to the higher one of self-recognition\r\nor consciousness in its most developed form. There is, however, a\r\nleading difference in the mental organization and mental processes\r\nof various animals, including man, which is of more importance in\r\nthe matter which we are considering, and is largely related to the\r\nphysical measurable difference in the size of the brain. The insects\r\nof which Fabre says: \"They know nothing about anything,\" inherit a\r\nnervous mechanism--a brain and elongated mass of nerve-cells and\r\nfibres, like our spinal cord--which works sharply and definitely like\r\na toy-automaton. Touch this part and that movement follows; excite the\r\nsense of vision with this visible thing, and such and such a movement\r\nof the limbs or jaws or other parts ensues. The stimulation of skin,\r\neye, ear, or nose conveys a \"message\" by nerves to the \"brain,\" or\r\ncentre, and immediately by other nerves an \"answer\" is conveyed from\r\nthe brain or centre in the shape of an order to this and those muscles\r\nto contract, the appropriate nerves being set at work and exciting the\r\nrelated muscles to contraction. The number of possible excitations and\r\nrelated responsive movements thus arranged is numerically very great\r\nin many animals, but they are limited. They are inherited just as they\r\nare, and come into action as soon as the necessary growth of the parts\r\ninvolved is attained, without hesitation or tentative trial. They are\r\nready made. The terms \"instinct\" and \"instinctive\" should be limited to\r\nthe action of this inherited apparatus or mechanism.\r\n\r\nAll animals, including man, have more or less of such an inherited\r\ninstinctive nervous apparatus. Man, or for the matter of that an\r\nanimal, may be \"conscious\" (in the sense of being \"aware\") of the\r\nstimulus given to this inherited apparatus, and of its related action,\r\nor he may be \"unconscious\" of either. The point is that we have here\r\nthe \"working\" of an apparatus inherited in a complete working state;\r\nit is, therefore, what we call instinctive. On the other hand, there\r\nare in higher animals, and especially in man, a vast number of actions\r\nperformed which are not the outcome of an inborn ready-made nervous\r\nmechanism. On the contrary, these actions are determined by a mechanism\r\nbuilt up in the animal during its individual existence--a mechanism\r\nwhich is formed by its individual experience acting on its nerve-cells,\r\nand is the outcome of observation, comparison, and, more or less, of\r\nprocesses which we call judgment and reasoning. The persistence of\r\nthis mechanism built up by the individual, as well as its continuous\r\nelaboration and development, is what we call \"memory,\" unconscious or\r\nconscious. It is misleading to speak of \"inherited memory\" or \"race\r\nmemory,\" and to apply it in any way to the inherited mechanisms of\r\ninstinct; the word should be reserved in its ordinary limitation to\r\nan individual's record. This new and superior apparatus appears to\r\nrequire a much larger bulk of brain-substance for its elaboration than\r\nthat which is sufficient for the inherited mechanisms of instinct. It\r\nworks in closer response to the innumerable details of the individual\r\ncase, and so must be much more complicated, and we can well believe\r\nmust require a larger instrument. Obviously it is an advantage to its\r\npossessor. He (be he animal or man) is provided not with a simple\r\nresponse suitable for the average of incidents in his life, but has,\r\nby the \"education\" due to the circumstances in which his individual\r\nlife is carried on, formed an ever-increasing store of special little\r\nmechanisms, giving the useful or advantageous response which he has\r\nhimself discovered to be appropriate to this or that sign, sound,\r\ncolour, shape, smell, touch, or what not which may assail his senses.\r\nIn proportion as the brain increases in volume (especially that part\r\nof it which is called \"the cortex of the hemispheres\") the animal to\r\nwhich that brain belongs loses--gets rid of--inherited mechanisms\r\nor instincts, and becomes \"educable,\" that is to say, capable of\r\nforming for itself new individual brain mechanisms based on memorized\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\"Educability\" is the quality which distinguishes the brain of increased\r\nsize. Dogs are more \"educable\" than rabbits; monkeys more so than dogs;\r\nand men more so--vastly more so--than monkeys and apes. The human\r\ninfant is born with a few inherited mechanisms of \"instinct,\" such\r\nas that which causes it to find its mother's nipple and to suck it,\r\nand to cling and support its own weight as no full-grown child can do.\r\nIt is singularly free from any large number of inherited \"instincts,\"\r\nand, to its own great advantage, has, during the many years in which it\r\nis protected by its parents, to learn everything and to construct new\r\nbrain mechanisms--the results of \"education\" of the individual. We here\r\nuse the word \"education\" in its proper and widest sense.\r\n\r\nThus we get an indication of \"the reason why\" the modern rhinoceros\r\nhas a brain eight times as big as the titanotherium's. It is more\r\n\"educable.\" The ancestors of our modern armour-plated friend have\r\nbeen surviving and beating their less \"educable\" brothers and sisters\r\nand cousins through a vast geological lapse of time; and the brains\r\nof the survivors have always been bigger, and they have become more\r\neducable and more educated until the race has culminated in those\r\nmodels of \"sweet reasonableness,\" the modern rhinoceroses! It must be\r\nconfessed that this character attributed to the rhinoceros is a matter\r\nof inference and not of direct observation of that animal when under\r\nhis native sky. We do not judge the survivor of a fine early Miocene\r\nfamily by the fury and annoyance he shows when shot at, nor by the\r\nstolid contempt with which he treats mankind at the Zoo. The same\r\nsignification--\"educability\"--attaches to the large brain of the higher\r\napes; and man's still larger brain means still greater educability and\r\nresulting reasonableness.\r\n\r\nIn order that natural selection and the survival of the fittest should\r\nhave led to this increased size and accompanying educability of the\r\nbrain, it is necessary to suppose that the individuals with the\r\nmore educable brain as they appeared profited by it, that is to say,\r\ndid become more educated, and so defeated their rivals, and survived\r\nand transmitted their increased size of brain little by little in\r\nsucceeding generations. There is no difficulty about admitting this\r\nsupposition in regard to the passage from higher ape-like creatures\r\nto later forms having a full-sized brain, such as we find in the\r\nNeanderthal man and in some Australians. But we are met here by what\r\nlooks, at first sight, as a fact inconsistent with our view. The\r\nobvious increased educability and consequent increased education\r\nof lower races of man by the circumstances of their lives, places\r\nthem clearly enough in a position of great advantage over the higher\r\nsurviving apes. But when we compare the actual mental accomplishments\r\nof the highest civilized races of man with those of big-brained\r\nsavages, we find that a large proportion of individuals in the\r\ncivilized races are much farther ahead of the lower savage races than\r\nmost of these are ahead of the higher apes. Newton, Shakespeare, and\r\nDarwin are in mental accomplishment farther away from an Australian\r\nblack, or even a Congo negro, than these \"savages\" are from a gorilla\r\nor a chimpanzee. Yet the difference when we compare the size and the\r\nabundance of the convolutions of the brain of the European philosopher\r\nand the black-fellow does not seem, superficially, to be proportionate\r\nto the difference in the mental performance of the two. No minute study\r\nof the microscopic differences in the structure of the two brains\r\nhas, as yet, been made, and it is probable that there is a greater\r\ndifference here than in the mere shape of the brain-mass. It seems\r\nthat the \"educability\" of the brain measured by its size is little\r\ngreater in the one group of men than in the other. And it is found--so\r\nfar as observation and experiment have been carried--that individual\r\nsavages belonging to races showing very low mental accomplishments in\r\ntheir native surroundings are yet capable of being \"educated\" to a far\r\nhigher level of mental performance, when removed in early youth from\r\ntheir natural conditions and subjected to the same conditions as the\r\nbetter-cared-for children of a civilized race, than any of them ever\r\nreach in their own communities.\r\n\r\nVery few really satisfactory experiments have been made in this\r\ndirection, but the history of the negroes in America shows that the\r\npure, unmixed negro brain is capable of showing high mathematical\r\npower, musical gifts of the best, and moral and philosophic activities\r\nequal to those of the best, or all but the exceptionally gifted,\r\nindividuals of European race. It seems that the large educable brain\r\ngained by man in a relatively early period of his development from\r\nthe ape has now entered on a new phase of importance. The pressure\r\nof natural selection no longer favours an increased educability (and\r\ntherefore size) of brain, but the later progress of man has depended\r\non the actual administration by each generation to its successors of\r\nan increasingly systematized exercise of that brain; in short, it has\r\ndepended on education itself, and on the gigantic new possibilities\r\nof education, which have followed from the development, first, of\r\nlanguage, then of writing, and lastly of printing, together with\r\nthe accompanying growth and development of social organization, the\r\ninter-communication of all races, and the carrying on, by means of the\r\nGreat Record--the written and printed documents of humanity--of the\r\nexperience and knowledge of each passing generation of men from them to\r\nthe men of the present moment.\r\n\r\nHuxley agreed with Cuvier in the opinion that the possession of\r\narticulate speech is the grand distinctive character of man. It was\r\nno sudden acquirement, but was slowly, step by step, evolved from\r\nthe significant grunts and cries of apes in the course of long ages,\r\nand corresponded in its progress with a parallel progress in mental\r\ncapacities. Once attained, it led to the formation of vast educative\r\nproducts, namely, to oral tradition, to written and then to printed\r\nmemorials and records. It is not desirable in our present state of\r\nknowledge to speculate as to whether the transitional ape-man acquired\r\nthe use of fire before or after he had invented articulate speech.\r\nIt probably was acquired very soon after some skill in the flaking\r\nof flints had been attained, and was of immense value, both as a\r\ndefence against predatory animals and as a means of preparing food.\r\nMan probably learnt at a very early period to cover himself with\r\nclothing made from the skins of other animals, and thus to tolerate\r\ncold climates. The use of clothing was correlated with the diminution\r\nof his natural hairy covering. As to the circumstances which led to\r\nthe reduction in size of his canine teeth and the diminution of the\r\nprojection of his jaws, it is impossible to say more than that this\r\nwas favoured by the increased skill of his hand and by the use of\r\nweapons, and probably was directly correlated with an increased growth\r\nof the brain. It is an interesting fact that very young children still\r\nexhibit the ancestral tendency to bite when angry, and that the use of\r\nthe teeth as weapons of attack is more frequent among lower races with\r\n\"prognathous\" jaws than among Europeans.\r\n\r\nA definite habit of the human infant, that of \"crying\"--the peculiar\r\nspasmodic howling of very young children--seems to be unknown in\r\nany of the apes. I do not know what ingenious reason may have been\r\nassigned for this difference. Apes laugh under the same circumstances\r\nas do men, but with less production of sound than is the case with\r\nman and the hyena. Man was, far back in his monkey-days, a social\r\nand companion-loving animal, and the fact that his laughing and his\r\nweeping are accompanied by noise is due to the desire for attention\r\nand sympathy from his friends. A great difference between man and apes\r\nis the greater power of expression of various feelings or emotions by\r\nthe face, and also the greater variety and significance in man of the\r\ngestures both of the upper and the lower limbs. These again are methods\r\nof seeking for and gaining sympathy and co-operation. Though not all\r\nmen and not all races in an equal degree have mobility and constantly\r\nvarying expression in the face, yet it is the fact that the man-like\r\napes which have been studied in life (the chimpanzee and orang) have\r\neven less variety and range of expression than the most unintelligent\r\nsavages. Man seems to have developed in an ever-increasing degree\r\nthe habit of watching and interpreting the face and of giving by it\r\nexpression to his emotions and states of mind, thus establishing\r\na ready means of producing common feeling and interest in a group\r\nof associated individuals. This seems to have led to a special\r\nappreciation of the features of the face, and so to the exercise of\r\nsexual selection, resulting in what we call \"a standard of beauty\" in\r\nregard to both shape and expression. It is quite possible that the\r\nreduction of the threatening canine teeth and projecting jaw may have\r\nbeen furthered by sexual selection when once a bite had become less\r\neffective than a blow with a sharp flint, and when persuasive sounds\r\nand gestures gained more adherents than the display of tusks by a snarl.\r\n\r\nWhat I have written in this and the preceding chapters, on the\r\ndifferences and likenesses between apes and man and the probable steps\r\nof the transition from ape to man, may assist the reader to form a\r\njudgment as to the importance of such remains of extinct races of men\r\nas the skeleton of the Sainte Chapelle, the Heidelberg jaw, and the\r\nPiltdown jaw and cranium lately dug up in Sussex, in helping us to\r\nfurther knowledge of those steps. It should be definitely noted that\r\nwe have not yet found any extinct animals, definitely to be classed\r\nas apes, which come nearer to man than the chimpanzee and gorilla,\r\nalthough we are led to infer that such creatures existed, and that\r\ntheir fossil remains will probably some day be discovered. On the other\r\nhand, we have in the jaw and skull recently discovered in the gravel of\r\nPiltdown, in Sussex, evidence of a man-like creature which was in most\r\nimportant features more ape-like than any fossil man yet discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE MISSING LINK\r\n\r\n\r\nUNTIL the discovery of the wonderful fossil jaw in the gravel of\r\nPiltdown, near Lewes in Sussex, a favourite view as to the probable\r\nrelationship of man and existing apes was, that if you could trace back\r\nthe pedigree of man and of the chimpanzee into remote antiquity far\r\nback in the Tertiary period--probably in the early Miocene--you would\r\narrive at a smallish creature with, proportionately to its size, larger\r\njaws and teeth than any modern man, yet smaller than those of the\r\nliving man-like apes, and with a brain not two-thirds the size of that\r\nof the least developed of modern savages, yet larger (in proportion\r\nto its general bulk) than that of the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and\r\ngibbons. This hypothetical creature would represent, it was held, the\r\ncommon ancestor of the two great \"strains\" or \"stocks\" one of which in\r\nthe course of gradual modification gave rise to our living \"humanity,\"\r\nand various non-surviving offshoots on the way; whilst the other gave\r\nrise to the company of great apes, with their tremendous jaws and\r\ndog-teeth, their small brains, and great bony skull-crests for the\r\nattachment of huge jaw muscles.\r\n\r\nIt was insisted that the obvious and immediate suggestion when once\r\nman's descent from animal ancestry was admitted, namely, that man has\r\ntaken his rise from the most man-like animals we know--the great\r\napes--is erroneous. The public was warned that they must not jump to\r\nsuch a conclusion; it was too obvious, too facile. The \"celebrated\r\nape of the Darwin shape,\" which popular songs made familiar to a wide\r\npublic, was declared to be only a remote rustic, not to say brutalized,\r\ncousin of humanity, not in the direct line happily! Our real ancestors,\r\nit was declared, were mild, intelligent little creatures, animals, it\r\nis true, but animals which hastened to separate their mixed qualities\r\nin two divergent lines of descent--(1) the intelligent, mild-mannered\r\nclan who ceased to climb trees, and walked uprightly on the soles of\r\ntheir feet, whilst their teeth grew smaller and smaller, and their\r\nbrains grew bigger and bigger; and (2) the violent tree-climbing\r\nmembers of the family, who refused to stand up, and acquired bigger and\r\nbigger jaws and teeth, whilst their brains remained small, their temper\r\nmorose, and their conduct violent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Comparison of the right half of the lower jaw\r\nof A, Modern European; B, Eoanthropus from Piltdown; and C, Chimpanzee.\r\nThe size of the drawings is two-thirds of the linear dimensions of the\r\nactual specimens. The dotted outline in B represents the part which was\r\nwanting in the original specimen and was thus re-constructed by Dr.\r\nSmith Woodward. _X_ in A is the bony chin or \"mental protuberance\"; in\r\nB and C it marks that part of the jaw which would become the mental\r\nprotuberance were the palisade or line of teeth retracted as in A.]\r\n\r\nOld writers before the days of Darwin had talked and written about\r\nthe \"missing link,\" though I cannot say who first used the term in\r\nreference to a creature intermediate between man and apes. Sir Charles\r\nLyell in 1851 made use of the term in regard to extinct animals which\r\nwere intermediate in structure between two existing types. A learned\r\nand able writer--the Scotch judge, Lord Monboddo--in the later half\r\nof the eighteenth century put forward a theory of the development of\r\nmankind from apes such as the orang, quite independently of any general\r\ntheory of \"transformism\" or of the progressive development of the\r\nanimal and vegetable worlds, from simple beginnings. Lord Monboddo,\r\nin the absence of any knowledge of a \"missing link,\" or of animals\r\nintermediate between man and the highest living apes, made reasonable\r\nspeculations (based on wide study of anthropology and ancient\r\nphilosophy) as to the passage from the monkey to man. He regarded man\r\nas of the same \"species\" as the orang-utan. He traced the gradual\r\nelevation of man to the social state as a natural process determined\r\nby \"the necessities of human life.\" He looked on language (which he\r\nsaid is not \"natural\" to man in the sense of being necessary to his\r\nself-preservation) as a consequence of his social state. His views\r\nabout the origin of society and language, and the faculties by which\r\nman is distinguished from the brutes, are in some interesting ways\r\nsimilar to those of Darwin. He conceived man as gradually elevating\r\nhimself from an animal condition in which his mind is immersed in\r\nmatter to a state in which mind acts independent of body. He was\r\nridiculed and declared to be half mad by his co-temporaries (among them\r\nSamuel Johnson), although he was, philosophically, far in advance of\r\nthose with whom he came into contact. Darwin's views on the \"Descent of\r\nMan\" were met in the same contemptuous spirit at first. But he held a\r\nmuch stronger position than Monboddo, having first of all established\r\nthe general theory of organic evolution, and having, further, a\r\nwell-established mass of evidence at his command in regard to the\r\nrelationship of man and apes. Further, he had that wonderful champion,\r\nHuxley, to fight for him. Huxley's book, \"Man's Place in Nature,\"\r\noriginally given as lectures which I, then a boy, attended, placed the\r\nevidence of the close relationship of man and the higher apes in the\r\nclearest way before the public, and, indeed, established the identity\r\nof the structure of man with that of the ape, bone for bone, muscle for\r\nmuscle, and nerve for nerve.\r\n\r\nStill, there was always a gap--a place unfilled--between the\r\nlarge-brained, small-jawed man and the small-brained, large-jawed ape.\r\nThe link was missing. It was hoped, when in 1859 the human workmanship\r\nof the flint axes found with the bones of extinct animals in our\r\nriver gravels was recognized, that the bones of the men who made the\r\nflint axes would turn up alongside of them, and that they would show\r\ncharacters intermediate between those of modern man and the great apes.\r\nBut no such human bones ever were found in the older gravels deposited\r\nas terraces along their beds by the rivers of Western Europe. Human\r\nbones, and more or less complete human skulls, of a highly-developed\r\nmodern type (the Cromagnards) were found in caves associated with flint\r\ntools of a different character to those common in river gravels. Then\r\nwe heard a good deal about the strangely flat skull-top, or calvaria,\r\nfound in a cave near Dusseldorf on the Rhine, associated with the\r\npreaching of a certain hermit named \"Neuman\" (= Neander). The valley\r\nwas called \"the Neanderthal,\" and the skull-top thus came to be called\r\nthe \"Neanderthal skull.\" Some authorities regarded the Neanderthal\r\nskull as that of an outcast idiot! Huxley studied it minutely, and\r\ncompared it to that of Southern Australian black-fellows, and held that\r\nit took us no nearer to the apes than they did. Then an unsatisfactory\r\nsmall flat skull-top, together with a long, straight thigh-bone, was\r\nfound in a gravel in Java, and the name \"Pithecanthropus\" was applied\r\nto these remains. Still we had got no nearer to any knowledge of the\r\nmissing link.\r\n\r\nOf late years we have, however, learnt a great deal more about the\r\nrace or species of men of which the Neanderthal skull-top was the\r\nfirst indication. We now know that this species of man belonged to a\r\nperiod older than that of the other prehistoric cavemen--the artistic\r\nMagdalenians and the bushman-like Aurignacians, which are races of\r\nHomo sapiens, not distinct species. The older period is called the\r\nMoustierian, or Middle Paleolithic, period, and is marked by a peculiar\r\ntype of flint implement. It is later than the older river gravels,\r\nin which big tongue-shaped and almond-shaped flint implements are\r\ncommon. The two skulls and bones from the cave of Spey, in Belgium, the\r\nGibraltar skull, and the skeletons and skulls of the cavern called the\r\nChapelle aux Saints in the Corrèze (Central France), and of Ferassy,\r\nand some neighbouring localities, all belong to this Moustierian age\r\n(so named after the village \"Le Moustier,\" in Perigord), and to the\r\npeculiar species Homo Neanderthalensis.[10] It is also necessary to\r\ninclude here the more ancient man indicated by the important lower jaw\r\nfound by Schottensack near Heidelberg (see Fig. 25). The Neanderman or\r\nNeanderthal-man had a low forehead, with overhanging bony brow-ridges,\r\nand a depressed, flattened brain-case, which, nevertheless, was very\r\nlong and broad and held an unusually large brain, measuring 1600 cubic\r\ncentimetres, whereas the modern European averages 1450 only of such\r\nunits. He had a powerful lower jaw, with a broad, upstanding piece\r\nor vertical \"ramus,\" and no chin protuberance. Yet his teeth were\r\nidentical with those of a modern man. His thigh-bones were much curved,\r\nand his arms a good deal longer in proportion to his legs than those\r\nof a modern man. He did not carry himself upright, but with a forward\r\nstoop.\r\n\r\n[10] For figures of the skulls and flint implements of these ancient\r\nmen, see my volume, \"Science from an Easy Chair,\" First Series.\r\nMethuen, 1910.\r\n\r\nNow that we know more of him, we may ask, \"Does this Neanderthal or\r\nMoustierian man fill the place of the missing link?\" It appears that\r\nhe does not. He seems to have died out without leaving any descendants.\r\nIn so far as that his bony jaw sloped directly downwards and backwards\r\nfrom the margin of the sockets of his front teeth, as in the apes,\r\nwithout projecting below, to form a chin protuberance--as it does in\r\nall races of Homo sapiens, on account of the shrinking inwards of\r\nthe gum-line or palisade of front teeth (incisors and canines)--the\r\nNeanderman offers a certain approach to the condition of the apes; but\r\nin other details of shape of the lower jaw, and especially in regard to\r\nthe narrowness of the lower surface of the chin and the large and deep\r\nattachments on its inner face, for the digastric muscle and certain\r\nmuscles of the tongue, the bony remains of the Neanderman show that\r\nhe is distinctly and altogether human, and not like the higher apes.\r\nMoreover, in the very large size of his brain (as much as 1600 units)\r\nthe Neanderman shows no approach to the relatively small brain of the\r\nhigher apes (which measures 500 units, possibly 800 by exception).\r\nThere is in these structures some argument for the conclusion that\r\nthe Neanderman could use articulate language, and inasmuch as the\r\nclimate in which he flourished was extremely cold, there is ground for\r\nsupposing that he could produce fire and clothe himself with skins. The\r\nflint implements which are definitely associated with him are of more\r\nskilful workmanship than the earlier, more elaborate, but less cleverly\r\nconceived, Chellean and Acheuillian implements. We cannot refuse\r\nto call him \"man\"--not Homo sapiens, we agree--but of the \"genus\"\r\nHomo--Homo Neanderthalensis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Diagrams of the lower surface of the\r\nlower jaw of A, man; B, the Eoanthropus of Piltdown (the left half\r\nreconstructed); and C, the Chimpanzee.\r\n\r\nThe jaws are supposed to be immersed in sand, so as to conceal all but\r\nthe lower surface. The narrowness of the actual inferior margin of the\r\njaw in man, A, a, b, contrasts with the breadth and flatness of this\r\nsame border in Eoanthropus, B, a, b, and the Chimpanzee, C, a, b.\r\n\r\nIn the human jaw A we see behind the narrow front border _a_ the large\r\nsemicircular excavations for the attachment of the digastric muscles\r\nright and left. They pass from here to the hyoid bone. From the spine\r\n(double in origin) between the two digastric impressions passes a pair\r\nof muscular slips, called the genio-hyoid muscles, also to the hyoid\r\nbone, and from the pair of spines marked _y_ a pair of muscles, called\r\nthe genio-glossals, pass to the tongue. These inferior and superior\r\nmental spines and the digastric impressions, much smaller in size than\r\nin man, are seen in the chimpanzee's jaw, C, but are rubbed or partly\r\nbroken and partly rubbed away in the Piltdown half-jaw, B. In the\r\nfigures A and C the size of the digastric impressions and mental spines\r\nis exaggerated, but their relatively much greater size in man than in\r\nthe chimpanzee is correctly given, and this greater size is connected\r\nwith the greater control of the tongue and the floor of the mouth in\r\nman, possibly connected with speech.\r\n\r\n_Reference Letters._--a, Broad, upwardly and forwardly sloping surface,\r\nreduced in man; b, lower border of the jaw-bone; x, front margin of the\r\ndigastric \"impression\" of the right side.

That view must be considerably\r\nmodified by the discovery of the Piltdown jaw--the jaw of Eoanthropus\r\nDawsoni--which is not that of a \"man,\" that is not of the genus\r\nHomo, but must, in my judgment, be considered as one of the family\r\nHominidæ--a Hominid, as we may say--a species assigned to a new\r\ngenus Eoanthropus by Smith Woodward, which is grouped with the genus\r\nHomo and the ill-defined genus Pithecanthropus, to form the family\r\nHominidæ; just as the genera Gorilla, Anthropopithecus (chimpanzee),\r\nSimia (orang), and Hylobates (gibbon) are grouped together to form\r\nthe family Simiidæ. In Eoanthropus we have in our hands, at last, the\r\nmuch-talked-of \"missing link\"--the link obviously connecting man, the\r\ngenus Homo, with the apes.\r\n\r\nThe immense importance of the discovery of the jaw of Eoanthropus by\r\nMr. Dawson, and of the clear perception of its distinctive features\r\nby Dr. Smith Woodward, is not, as yet, sufficiently recognized. The\r\nPiltdown jaw is the most startling and significant fossil bone that\r\nhas ever been brought to light. The Neandermen and the Java skull-top\r\nare simply commonplace and insignificant in comparison with it. \"What\r\nleads you to say that?\" I may be asked. I say so because this jaw and\r\nthe incomplete skull found with it (Fig. 29) really and in simple fact\r\nfurnish a link--a form intermediate between the man and the ape. Some\r\nfragments of the brain-case were found close to the jaw, indicating\r\na fairly round, very thick-walled brain-case, holding a brain of\r\nabout 1100 units capacity--very small for a man, very large for an\r\nape. It is in the highest degree probable that the brain-case and the\r\njaw belong to the same individual. If we were to put the brain-case\r\naside as not certainly belonging to the same individual, we should\r\nguess that the owner of the jaw might have had a brain of about this\r\nsize--intermediate between that of the larger apes and the living races\r\nof men.[11]\r\n\r\n[11] The recent discovery by Mr. Dawson of fragments of a second skull\r\nof the same character as the first and at the same spot justifies a\r\ncertain amount of hesitation in concluding that the lower jaw and the\r\nfragments of the first found skull belong to one individual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--The Piltdown Jaw (shaded) and the Heidelberg\r\nJaw (outline only) super-imposed and compared by placing the first and\r\nsecond molar teeth (1 and 2) of the two specimens in exact coincidence\r\non the horizontal line A, B. The linear dimensions of the drawings\r\nare reduced to two-thirds of those of the specimens. It is obvious\r\nthat when the front bony part of the Piltdown jaw is completed with an\r\noutline like that of the Heidelberg and Neander jaws, as shown by the\r\ndotted line _m_, the space between its molars and the sockets of its\r\nfront teeth cannot be filled by teeth of the normal human dimensions,\r\nas it is in the Heidelberg jaw. As the figure shows, they would stop\r\nshort half an inch from the front of the jaw. Hence Dr. Smith Woodward\r\ninferred that larger teeth like those of a chimpanzee were present in\r\nthis region in the Piltdown jaw (Eoanthropus).]\r\n\r\nThe astonishing thing about this half-jaw from Piltdown is that it is\r\ndefinitely and obviously more like that of a chimpanzee--especially\r\na young chimpanzee--than it is like that of a man (see Fig. 23, A,\r\nB, and C and their explanation). If it had been found under other\r\ncircumstances it might quite well have been described as the jaw of a\r\nsimiid--a large ape allied to the chimpanzee--with some unimportant\r\nresemblance to a human one. The front part of the bony jaw of Piltdown,\r\ninstead of forming a narrow ridge below the protruding bony chin as in\r\nman, is wide and flat; there is no protruding chin. This very important\r\nfact is shown in our Fig. 24, in which the lower margin of the lower\r\njaw of modern man, of the chimpanzee and of the Piltdown specimen are\r\ncompared. The jaw ended in front in a wall of bone sloping forward\r\nand upward continuously from the flat and broad lower surface of the\r\njaw. In this the great incisor teeth were set, as in all Simiids. In\r\nman, on the contrary, the front group of teeth is much smaller than in\r\nthe apes, and the semicircle formed by the line of the gums is much\r\nsmaller than the semicircular lower margin of the jaw. The semicircle\r\nof teeth in man retreats (as it were) behind the front part of the\r\nbony jaw which is left projecting far in advance of the line of teeth,\r\nforming the \"chin\" or \"chin protuberance.\" The Piltdown jaw when found\r\nhad only two of the cheek-teeth in place, as shown in Fig. 25. They\r\nwere certainly very human in pattern and in the smoothness of their\r\nworn surfaces. But it was found impossible to fill the front part\r\nof the bony jaw with the missing teeth if they also were fashioned\r\naccording to human pattern. They would in that case only reach along\r\nthe jaw to a distance of an inch and three-fifths from the first molar\r\ntooth, whereas to fill the space from that tooth up to the front end\r\nof the bone in which the teeth are socketed they must be big enough\r\nto occupy a length of two inches and two-fifths (consult Fig. 25 and\r\nits explanation). Dr. Smith Woodward did not hesitate, in view of the\r\nshape of the jaw so closely like that of a chimpanzee, to postulate the\r\nformer existence in it of big front teeth--canines and incisors--like\r\nthose of a chimpanzee, and unlike those of man, although there was\r\nno trace of them left in the specimen. He restored the jaw, giving\r\nit very much the shape and the teeth of a chimpanzee's jaw (Fig. 23,\r\nB). That this was a correct interpretation was proved a year later,\r\nin a startling, almost romantic way, by the discovery by Mr. Dawson\r\nand a young French naturalist who were resifting and searching the\r\ngravel at the exact spot where the jaw was found, of one of the great\r\ncanine teeth, twice as big as that of any man and resembling that of\r\na chimpanzee (see Fig. 26 and its explanation). There was a good deal\r\nof hesitation about the admission of the correctness of Dr. Smith\r\nWoodward's presentation of the jaw of Eoanthropus, with so close a\r\nresemblance to that of a chimpanzee. But the careful consideration\r\nof the specimen, and above all the welcome discovery of the great\r\nape-like canine, has now convinced every anatomist of the truth of Dr.\r\nWoodward's restoration. The jaw itself and the recovered canine tooth,\r\nas well as the completely restored model of the two sides of the lower\r\njaw and of the brain-case, may now be seen and studied by visitors to\r\nthe Natural History Museum. They are placed in the Geological Gallery.\r\nI have visited with Mr. Dawson the gravel at Piltdown where the jaw\r\nand skull were found, and have picked up there humanly worked flints\r\nof very primitive workmanship. I have also followed with Dr. Smith\r\nWoodward the development and confirmation of his interpretation of the\r\njaw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--The canine tooth of the right side of the\r\nlower jaw of Eoanthropus Dawsoni, found at Piltdown a year after the\r\ndiscovery and description of the lower jaw, to which it belongs.

This \"first\" tooth is drawn\r\nof twice its actual length and breadth, which brings it very nearly to\r\nthe same size as the canine of Eoanthropus. It is more closely similar\r\nin shape to the canine of the Piltdown jaw than is the canine of the\r\nsecond or permanent dentition of modern man.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--The Piltdown Jaw (Eoanthropus) with dotted\r\nlines showing the parts as now \"re-constructed\" or \"imagined\" by Dr.\r\nSmith Woodward, together with the late-found or recovered canine in its\r\nnatural position.]\r\n\r\nI now desire to insist upon the legitimate conclusion to be drawn\r\nfrom this wonderful specimen. That conclusion is that the creature,\r\nindicated by it, is not (or was not when it was alive) an eccentric\r\ncousin either of the Simiid or of the Hominid stock, but represents\r\na real \"missing link,\" an animal intermediate in great and obvious\r\nfeatures between the two stocks, and either to be described as an ape\r\nwhich had become man-like or as a man who still retained characteristic\r\nape-like features--a truly connecting or linking form. Nothing like it,\r\nnothing occupying such a position, has hitherto been discovered. It\r\nbrings the focus of interest in the knowledge of primitive man away\r\nfrom the caves of France to the thin patch of iron-stained gravel in\r\nthe meadow-land of the River Ouse as it flows through the Sussex weald.\r\nThese remains are the first remains of a man-like creature found in a\r\nPleistocene river gravel, and they exceed in interest any human remains\r\nas yet known. There is now reason to hope that more such remains will\r\nbe discovered in similar gravels.[12]\r\n\r\n[12] The human lower jaw found at Moulin-Quignon fifty years ago by\r\nworkmen who brought it to M. Boucher de Perthes, was dismissed after\r\nmuch study and examination by the most competent anatomists at the time\r\nas being a comparatively recent specimen. I do not know whether it has\r\nbeen preserved. I have a flint implement found with it which was given\r\nto me in 1862 by M. de Perthes as genuine. It is a forgery, and the jaw\r\nwas fraudulently buried with it and others in order to deceive M. de\r\nPerthes and earn a pecuniary reward for the forgers.\r\n\r\nIt would be highly important were we able to arrive at a satisfactory\r\nconclusion as to what age must be attributed to the Piltdown jaw and\r\nskull. Did we know their age their true significance as a link between\r\nman and ape would be more easily estimated. The gravel in which they\r\nwere found contains a handful, as it were, of the sweepings of the land\r\nsurface of the great Weald valley of Sussex of all ages and periods\r\nsince the emergence of the chalk from the ocean floor--an immense lapse\r\nof time, amounting probably to millions of years! In this sparse and\r\ninconspicuous patch of gravel we find fragments of teeth of mastodon\r\nand elephant and rhinoceros of Miocene and Pliocene age; we also find\r\nbones of quite late kinds of mammals of the Pleistocene period; we also\r\nfind two kinds of roughly chipped flint instruments belonging the one\r\nto an earlier and the other to a later age. All are mixed up together\r\nin the gravel. When we come to the question as to which of these\r\nremains are of animals which were the contemporaries of Eoanthropus,\r\nall we can say is that Eoanthropus, the creature whose jaw was found\r\nat Piltdown, may have lived as late as the latest or as early as the\r\nearliest of the animals whose remains are associated with it. The\r\nEoanthropus remains are not so heavily mineralized, it seems to me, as\r\nare the fragments of teeth of Miocene age found with them. At the same\r\ntime, we have no ground for assuming that this creature made either\r\nthe earlier or the later type of flint implements found with it, or was\r\ncapable of such manufacture. I see no reason for supposing, whatever\r\nmay be the age which we may have to attribute to Eoanthropus, that that\r\ncreature was capable of flaking flints to a desired shape or of making\r\nfire or had developed the use of articulate speech. Nor is there any\r\nevidence to show that the humanly cut elephant-bone recently found at\r\nPiltdown by Mr. Dawson was cut by Eoanthropus. It is more probable that\r\nthis was done by a more highly developed creature of the genus Homo.\r\nIn fact, the only ground which at present justifies the association\r\nof Eoanthropus with the Hominidæ or human series rather than with the\r\nSimiidæ or ape series--derived from a common ancestry--is the man-like\r\nrather than ape-like size of the brain, which we must attribute to\r\nEoanthropus on the assumption, which is at present a reasonable one,\r\nthat the half-jaw and the incomplete skull found near each other at\r\nPiltdown are parts of the same individual.[13]\r\n\r\n[13] But see foot-note on p. 284.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Complete Skull and Jaw of Eoanthropus Dawsoni.\r\nOne-third the natural diameter.

There has\r\nbeen a tendency, resulting from some of the well-ascertained chemical\r\nnecessities of the animal body and the equally well-ascertained\r\nchemical composition of different articles of food, to suppose that\r\nall that we have to do in regard to diet is to make sure that our\r\nfood supplies us with so much carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen,\r\nwith small quantities of phosphates, sulphates, and chlorides of\r\npotassium, sodium, calcium (lime), and iron, in a \"digestible\" form,\r\nin order to replace those chemical elements as their combinations are\r\nused up and thrown off as waste by our bodies. The general notions\r\ncurrent are little more exact than this. It is recognized, it is true,\r\nthat these elements must be combined in certain forms; that it is\r\nnecessary to take so much \"proteid\" (meat, gluten of flour, casein\r\nof cheese and milk, albumen of egg), in which nitrogen is a leading\r\ncomponent, foods which are called flesh-formers; and, further, that it\r\nis necessary to take others which supply carbon and hydrogen but have\r\nno nitrogen, namely, the hydro-carbons--fat, butter, and oil--and\r\nthe carbo-hydrates--sugar and starch--foods which serve as mere fuel\r\nor heat-and-force givers. The late proprietor of \"Truth,\" Mr. Henry\r\nLabouchere, once said to me that the doctors ought to provide us with a\r\nsausage containing in their simplest form the necessary proportions of\r\nproteid and of heat-giver (fat and sugar), and that we should abandon\r\nall \"sit-down\" meals, pulling the necessary sausage out of our pockets\r\nwithout any fuss or interruption to our occupation, and eating a couple\r\nof inches or so, three or four times a day! Experimental feeding of\r\nanimals (in menageries, etc.), and even of men (in prison, on the\r\nmarch, and on ships), has sometimes taken very nearly as simple a form\r\nas this.\r\n\r\nBut we now know (and many, indeed, have recognized it for many years)\r\nthat the nutrition of the animal body, and especially of man's body, is\r\nnot so simple a matter as this method would suppose. It is necessary\r\nnot merely to supply the proteids, fats, starches, and sugars, in\r\ncorrect weight and bulk, but also certain qualities and substances in\r\nfood, much more subtle and difficult to estimate precisely, which are\r\nrequired in order to maintain health. There are elaborate chemical\r\ncompounds present in really \"fresh\" meats and vegetables which seem to\r\nbe absolutely necessary in order to keep man (and some of the higher\r\nanimals) in health, and not only that, but it is ascertained that\r\nwithout them he cannot be properly nourished, but dies! These subtle,\r\nhighly complex bodies seem to be present in very small quantities in\r\ngood fresh food, and yet are absolutely necessary though so minute in\r\namount. The failure of a diet consisting exclusively of tinned meats\r\nand preserved foods is due as much to this as to the nausea set up by\r\nit--of which I have written on a former occasion (\"Science from an\r\nEasy Chair,\" Second Series, 1913, p. 171, \"Food and Cookery\").\r\n\r\nLet us take an example. A distinguished medical chemist, Mr. Gowland\r\nHopkins, has recently published an account of some experiments in\r\nwhich he fed young rats on a purely chemical, or \"artificial\" diet. He\r\ngave them, in proper proportions, chemically purified casein or curd,\r\nstarch, sugar, lard, and salts, mixed into a thin paste with water,\r\nof which they had an abundant separate supply. Young rats fed with\r\nabundant natural foods of mixed substances, such as cheese, bread,\r\negg, bits of meat and vegetable, and water, grow rapidly; they double\r\ntheir weight in twenty days. The young rats fed by Mr. Hopkins upon\r\nthe artificial pure food--though supplied with it and taking it in\r\nabundance--did not increase in weight, and most of them died before\r\nthe twentieth day! The curious and important fact was established (by\r\ncareful and repeated experiment) that if a teaspoonful of milk was\r\nadded to the artificial food (less than one twenty-fifth of the solid\r\nmatter of their daily food) the young rats did as well as on \"natural\"\r\nfood, doubled their weight in twenty days, and grew up to be strong\r\nand healthy rats. It was made clear that something was obtained by the\r\nrats from the small quantity of milk--something necessary for carrying\r\non their nutrition, something the importance of which was not its\r\nquantity but its peculiar quality, which was absent in the artificial\r\ndiet, but present in the mixed diet of varied materials which a young\r\nrat naturally gets. It seems that some highly elaborated proteid is\r\nnecessary, if only in minute quantity, to set nutrition going, and that\r\nthis is furnished by the teaspoonful of milk. Here, then, we have a\r\ncase in which the simple rough conclusions as to all that is necessary\r\nin diet being the proper quantities of flesh-forming and heat-giving\r\nsubstance, are found to be erroneous.\r\n\r\nTake another case--that of the disease known as \"scurvy.\" The word\r\n\"scurvy\" means \"afflicted with scurf, mean and dirty.\" It was applied\r\nto persons afflicted by this particular disease, and a Latin medical\r\nword, \"Scorbutus,\" was made from it in the Middle Ages, which survives\r\nas \"scorbutic\" at the present day. Scurvy was formerly very common on\r\nboard ship, in beleaguered armies, in prisons, and in other conditions\r\nin which men's food was limited to dried and salted, often badly\r\npreserved, meat and biscuit, or stale bread. Its real causation is\r\nnot even now agreed upon: some holding that it was due to actual\r\npoisoning by the badly preserved food, others that it was due to the\r\nabsence of certain elements--only to be obtained from fresh meat or\r\nfresh vegetables. Others think that it was caused by a bacterium. The\r\nvictim of scurvy becomes much debilitated, the gums become spongy and\r\nulcerated, and extravasations of blood are found in all parts of the\r\nbody, often leading to ulceration. In the old times a whole ship's crew\r\nof the Navy would be attacked by it, and half or more died before a\r\nport could be reached and fresh food obtained. It was found that the\r\nuse of fresh vegetables, fresh meat, and the juice of fruits prevented\r\nits outbreak, and cured it when once started. For one hundred and fifty\r\nyears it has been held in check by the use of lime-juice as a drink\r\nwhenever supplies of fresh vegetables and meat run short. It has now\r\nbecome so unusual a disease that there has been no proper study of it\r\nin the light of modern knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be essentially the same condition of malnutrition as\r\nthat which prevailed in cities and large tracts of country in the\r\nMiddle Ages and occurs at the present day in Norway, caused by a diet\r\nof badly salted fish and dried meat. This produced ulceration of the\r\nextremities, allowing the leprosy bacillus to make its way through the\r\nbroken skin into the tissues, and thus led to the widespread occurrence\r\nof leprosy. Whether bacilli of any kind were concerned in the old\r\nvirulent outbreaks of \"scurvy\" on sailing ships must remain uncertain,\r\nbut it is highly probable that they were. In any case, it is certain\r\nthat the juice of fresh meat or of fresh vegetables when taken set\r\ngoing a better condition of nutrition in the body, and so acted as\r\na preventive and a cure of scurvy. Some writers suppose that it was\r\nthe salts, such as citrates and lactates, present in fresh fruits and\r\nvegetables which were effective in staying the disease; but this has\r\nby no means been proved, and is not, at the moment, accepted. It is\r\nprobable that here, as in the case of Mr. Hopkins's rats, it was a\r\nquite minute quantity of a readily-destroyed proteid present in fresh\r\nmeat and vegetables which was necessary to keep the chemical processes\r\nof nutrition in healthy activity.\r\n\r\nThis view is supported by the fact that in recent years a disease of\r\ninfants similar to scurvy, and called \"infantile scurvy,\" has been\r\ndescribed by Sir Thomas Barlow, and fully recognized. It is a condition\r\nof \"malnutrition,\" and is accompanied by \"rickets,\" and is due in the\r\nfirst place to failure of the mother's milk, and secondly to the bad\r\nquality of the cows' milk substituted for it. Owing to the danger\r\nof infection by bovine tubercle-bacillus and the great expense of\r\n\"certified\" milk from specially selected cows (eightpence a quart),\r\nit is customary to boil the milk given to children. There seems to\r\nbe no doubt that good milk, freshly boiled, is satisfactory. But the\r\nconstant use of sterilized milk and so-called Pasteurized milk, as\r\nwell as inferior \"watered\" and more or less stale milk, is frequently\r\nthe cause of infantile scurvy. Something is destroyed in the milk by\r\nprolonged heating which is necessary for its proper action as a food.\r\nThe addition to the milk of a small quantity of fresh meat-juice\r\nor beetroot-juice appears to replace this destroyed matter, and to\r\nprevent malnutrition and scurvy. And thus the babies are rescued from\r\n\"infantile scurvy.\" Here, again, it is a question of the presence of a\r\nminimal quantity of an easily destroyed proteid, which is necessary to\r\nstart the nutritional process and to keep it going.\r\n\r\nA very interesting case of the unsuspected influence of minute\r\nquantities of such a \"proteid\" body (that is, a body like casein and\r\nalbumen, but higher in the complexity of its chemical structure and\r\nnearer to the readily destroyed chemical complexity of living matter\r\nitself) has lately been discovered. In the East, especially amongst\r\nChinese \"coolies\" and other people who feed on rice, a very troublesome\r\ndisease is known, called \"Berri-berri.\" It is chiefly marked by pains\r\nall over the body, lassitude, and debility, and renders its victims\r\nunfit for labour, and so causes great inconvenience to employers of\r\n\"Chinese cheap labour.\" All sorts of causes have been suggested for\r\nit. But it has now been found that it is due to the feeding of the\r\ncoolies with \"polished rice.\" This is an inferior rice, the grains\r\nof which have become (by bad, damp storage) rough and powdery on the\r\nsurface. The bad rice grain is purchased by dealers and shaken up and\r\nsifted so as to get rid of this dull surface, and is then known as\r\n\"polished rice.\" The grain has lost its outer coat. It has been found\r\nthat domesticated birds (pigeons and fowls) fed on this polished rice\r\nbecome ill with symptoms like those of \"Berri-berri,\" and even die.\r\nAnd it has been further discovered that these same birds can be cured\r\nby mixing some of the separated outer coat of sound rice grains with\r\nthe \"polished rice.\" The result of this observation on birds has been\r\napplied to human patients suffering from \"Berri-berri.\" It is found\r\nthat they are rapidly cured by giving them rice \"outsides\" to eat, and\r\nthat those who are feeding on \"polished rice\" can be prevented from\r\nacquiring the disease \"Berri-berri\" by mixing rice \"outsides\" with the\r\npolished rice. The study of the subject has gone further.\r\n\r\nA crystallizable substance allied to proteids has been separated by the\r\nchemist in quite minute quantity (one part by weight in 10,000 parts of\r\nrice) from the outer coat of rice grain, and is called \"vitamine.\" It\r\nis this substance which prevents the \"whole\" rice grain from causing\r\n\"Berri-berri\" in men and birds who feed on it, and it has been shown\r\nexperimentally that it prevents the development of \"Berri-berri\" when\r\ntaken with \"polished rice,\" and cures it when administered to man or\r\nbird suffering from that disease. This case calls to mind the popular\r\nnotion that the indigestion caused by eating a \"peeled\" raw cucumber\r\ncan be prevented by eating some of the dark-green \"rind\" or outside\r\nof the cucumber. I do not know that anyone has ever shown that this\r\nis a true doctrine, but it serves as an illustration of what has been\r\ndemonstrated in the case of rice grains and \"Berri-berri.\" Here, then,\r\nagain we have, in the case of rice, a minute quantity of a substance\r\nnaturally present in an article of food when taken in its natural\r\nnormal condition, which is destroyed and removed by the ignorant\r\nmanipulation of man, although necessary and essential if that article\r\nof food is to serve as healthy diet. In this case (as so many others)\r\nit is the attempt of greedy traders to make money by giving to a\r\nworthless spoilt article the appearance of the regular and valuable\r\narticle, which has led to disease and disaster. It becomes more and\r\nmore obvious that the selection of articles of food and the whole\r\nquestion of what is a healthy diet, are not such simple things as is\r\noften supposed. Here, as in everything we do, we must either keep to\r\nthe long-established habits sanctioned by Nature, or we must have full\r\nand detailed knowledge to guide us in new ways, so that we shall not\r\nrecklessly blunder by ignorance into disaster and death. The \"feeding\"\r\nof man and of his herds requires new and continued investigation. Old\r\nconvictions and traditions in these matters must not be lightly thrust\r\naside by the possessor of that little knowledge which is a dangerous\r\nthing. Meanwhile, for the civilized man the advice of Pasteur's pupil\r\nand successor, the late Professor Duclaux, is noteworthy: \"Do not\r\neat much, but eat many things; there is safety in variety, danger in\r\nuniformity.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the importance of these small quantities of easily\r\ndestroyed constituents in natural foods, we begin to appreciate the\r\ndifficulty of securing a pure milk-supply which shall be at the same\r\ntime a nourishing and a healthy one. The sterilizing of milk by heat\r\nbefore it is sold as an article of diet seems to be desirable in order\r\nto destroy the bovine tubercle-bacillus which may be there and the\r\nother injurious microbes due to the dirty conditions in which the cow\r\nis kept and the milkers keep themselves. The heating of the milk for\r\nsome twenty minutes to a temperature below that of boiling water seems\r\nto be the best plan. For infants, meat-juice or beet-juice may then\r\nbe added to the milk when used, and so \"infantile scurvy\" be avoided.\r\nConsumers (older children and adults) who are taking other foods do not\r\nneed this additional precaution. Milk thus \"Pasteurized\" is the safest\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nBut there is a very serious precaution to be observed in all cases. In\r\nsuch Pasteurized milk the lactic organism or ferment usually present\r\nis destroyed. Consequently the milk does not \"go sour\" by the growth\r\nof the lactic ferment. This is no advantage, but a serious danger. For\r\nthe lactic \"souring\" of milk is not injurious, but, on the contrary, a\r\nsafeguard. It actually prevents the growth in the milk of other really\r\nharmful and deadly germs. Thus when the lactic germ is not there,\r\nbut killed by heat, these other deadly germs get their chance. A fly\r\nor other dirt-carrier brings to the sterilized milk \"putrefactive\"\r\nbacteria and such germs (terribly common) as those of \"green\" or\r\ninfantile diarrhœa, not to mention others. If the milk had been\r\nunsterilized and gone sour by the growth of the lactic ferment, these\r\nmore dangerous germs could not have flourished in the acid conditions\r\nproduced by it. The danger of Pasteurized milk is that if kept more\r\nthan a few hours at the ordinary temperature of a dwelling-room, and\r\nnot carefully protected, it may be a very ready means of communicating\r\ninfantile diarrhœa and other intestinal disease. It would therefore\r\nseem to be desirable to restore to the Pasteurized milk a small\r\nquantity of a pure culture of lactic germs. This could be easily done.\r\nThe milk would have had its tubercle-bacilli and others removed by\r\nheat, and then, after cooling, it would receive a very few lactic\r\ngerms as a protective in case it should be kept by the consumer long\r\nenough to get infected by the bacteria of intestinal disease. It is\r\nimperative that good, nourishing milk, free from germs of tubercle\r\nand of diarrhœa, shall be accessible to the millions in this country\r\nwho cannot afford to pay eightpence a quart for it. It is a difficult\r\ndemand to meet. What is said above explains the difficulty, and\r\nsuggests an attempt to overcome it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS TREES AND OTHER PINE TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN winter grips our land it is fitting to discourse about the sweet\r\nand refreshing pine trees which are especially associated in northern\r\nclimes with the celebration of Christmas. The delicious perfume which\r\nthey diffuse is destructive both of microbes and noxious insects,\r\nwhilst they are always linked in our minds with glorious mountain-sides\r\nor breezy moorland, or the delightful sand dunes and grey rocks of the\r\nsunny shores of the Mediterranean. The decoration of trees on days\r\nof festival and joyful celebration with garlands, lamps, and gifts\r\nis an immemorial custom of mankind, and it is probably merely the\r\naccident of its being convenient in shape, evergreen, cleanly, and\r\nsweet-smelling that has led to the selection of the common spruce as\r\nthe \"Christmas tree.\" It was not until the reign of Queen Victoria\r\nthat the custom of bringing a young spruce fir into the house, growing\r\nin its special flowerpot, and then decorating it and making it the\r\ncentre of a children's festival, became established in England. The\r\n25th of December was celebrated in pre-Christian times in Northern\r\nEurope as the beginning of the New Year, and it was only after much\r\nopposition adopted by the Roman Church in the sixth century as a feast\r\nday in celebration of the birth of Christ. The Puritans rejected it as\r\nidolatrous, but its observance was restored by Charles II. In Scotland\r\nit is still ignored, and in Latin countries presents (_strenæ_, or in\r\nFrench _les étrennes_) are given on New Year's Day and not on Christmas\r\nDay.\r\n\r\nThe spruce is in our part of the world the commonest of the great\r\nseries of cone-bearing trees which we speak of as pines and firs.\r\nBotanists call this series or \"natural order\" of trees the Coniferæ,\r\nin reference to the fact that their flowers are cone-shaped growths\r\nconsisting of scales set in a spiral order around a central stem.\r\nEach scale is more or less overlaid by a second small scale or\r\n\"bract\" (sometimes evanescent), and on the inner surface of the\r\ndeeper scale the naked ovules are carried in the female cones, whilst\r\nthe pollen-producing growths are similarly carried by the smaller\r\nand more delicate male cones. The ovules are exposed nakedly, and\r\nare, therefore, in a more primitive condition than those of ordinary\r\nflowering plants, in which they are overgrown and enclosed by the\r\nmodified leaves which form the \"pistil\" or central part of the flower.\r\nHence the conifers are called flowering plants with \"naked seeds,\" or\r\nGymnosperms, whilst the rest of the flower-bearing plants are called\r\nplants with \"covered seeds,\" or Angiosperms. The cones are at first\r\ngreen (sometimes purple), and become brown as they ripen. The small\r\nloosely-packed male cones, less familiar to most people than the solid\r\nand large seed-bearing cones, are often of a fine crimson colour when\r\nyoung, and when ripe of a bright chestnut brown, but the cones of pine\r\ntrees are with few exceptions (the Douglas fir is one) not brilliantly\r\ncoloured nor set out to attract the eye, as are the flowers of most\r\nflowering plants. Though a young branch carrying its groups of green\r\n\"needles,\" rich brown male cones, silver-white hairs and swelling\r\nseed-cones (Fig. 31) presents a very fine harmony of diverse colours,\r\nyet they are not constructed so as to attract the visits of insects.\r\nThey do not require the services of insects to carry the pollen of the\r\nmale cones to the ovules of the female cones. They produce an enormous\r\namount of pollen, which falls in showers of yellowish-white dust, and\r\nis blown by the wind, far and wide, on to the female cones. Hence it is\r\nthat though the cones are \"flowers,\" and the pine trees are flowering\r\nplants, yet they have none of the beautiful shapes and colours which\r\nwe associate, as a rule, with flowers--shapes and colours due to the\r\nmodification in the latter of the leaves called \"petals\" which are set\r\nwith attractive brilliancy around the stamens and pistil. The conifers\r\nare an ancient race, dating from geological ages before the chalk, when\r\nplants had not \"learnt\" (as they subsequently did) to colour their\r\nflowers and to provide nectar so as to ensure the visits of insects\r\nand the carriage by them of their pollen from plant to plant. Even in\r\nthe group of plants with coloured flowers there are trees which have\r\nabandoned the production of colour in their flowers, and like the\r\nconifers depend upon the wind to carry their pollen instead of seeking\r\nthe aid of insects.\r\n\r\nThe word \"pine\" is of Latin origin, and belongs properly to the South\r\nof Europe; the word \"fir\" is Teutonic, and is originally applied to the\r\nsame trees in the North of Europe as those to which \"pine\" is applied\r\nin the South. It is of no use trying to determine what conifers should\r\nrightly be called \"firs\" or \"fir trees,\" and which \"pines\" or \"pine\r\ntrees.\" There is complete confusion and indifference nowadays in the\r\nuse of those words, and the botanists have in the past added to the\r\nconfusion by their changing and uncertain use of the names Pinus and\r\nAbies. A definite system of naming has now been agreed upon, and we\r\nmust, in order to understand one another in talking about conifers,\r\nstrictly accept and adhere to the names at this moment assigned to them\r\nby the common consent of botanical authorities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--A fertile branch of the Scots Fir, Pinus\r\nsylvestris, showing the small male cones, _m.c._, and the larger female\r\ncones, _f.c._, also the foliage needles grouped in pairs. Drawn of\r\ntwo-thirds the natural size, linear.\r\n\r\nThe lower figures relate to the male cone. a, A ripe male cone,\r\nslightly enlarged; b, inner face of one of the scales of the male\r\ncone, showing the paired pollen-producing or stamen-like patches--much\r\nmagnified; c, outer face of the same scale.]\r\n\r\nThe Scots fir is Pinus sylvestris. \"Pinus\" is the name of a genus\r\nof conifers, and includes many species besides sylvestris, our own\r\nfamiliar Scots fir, which is often now spoken of by the queer,\r\nill-sounding title of Scotch pine. The Norway spruce or pine, called\r\noften \"common spruce,\" also \"the spruce fir,\" and \"Christmas tree,\" is\r\nthe \"Picea excelsa\" of correct botany. There are several other species\r\nof the genus Picea. A third well-known conifer, the silver fir, is\r\ncalled by botanists \"Abies pectinata\"; there are many other species\r\nof Abies. Although it has such a familiar, sweet-sounding name, the\r\nsilver fir is not a common tree in England, where it was introduced\r\nonly three hundred years ago. It will not thrive at Kew Gardens. It is\r\nthe common forest-making fir of the centre of France and of much of the\r\nmountainous country of Southern Europe,[14] but it is rarely to be seen\r\nin the Swiss mountains (only in certain relatively low-lying valleys).\r\nThe pine forests of those mountains are almost exclusively formed by\r\nthe spruce, with the addition of a few Scots firs and larches, and in\r\nsome parts of the Arolla fir or pine.\r\n\r\n[14] It is, according to botanical authorities, from the wood of the\r\nsilver fir, which still grows on Mount Ida, that the Greeks, as related\r\nby Virgil, constructed the Trojan horse.\r\n\r\n  \"Instar montis equum, divina Palladis arte\r\n  Ædificant, sectaque intexunt _abiete_ costas!\r\n  (A horse of mountain size they build\r\n  By art divine of Pallas helped\r\n  And weave its ribs with planks of fir).\r\n  \"Æneid,\" ii. 15.\r\n\r\nThe common larch is a fourth common kind of conifer. It is\r\ndistinguished from other pine trees which flourish in England by\r\nshedding its needles so as to leave itself bare in the winter. It is\r\ncalled \"Larix Europœa,\" and is closely related to the cedars. It was\r\nintroduced into England in 1629.\r\n\r\nMan by his migrations and trading journeys has had far more to do with\r\nthe introduction and spreading of trees, and even of small flowering\r\nplants, from one country to another, than is commonly suspected. It\r\nappears that of the trees I have already mentioned only the Scots\r\nfir is really native to these islands. Even the Christmas tree, the\r\ncommon spruce, was introduced from the Continent by invading man after\r\nwe had become separated by the sea from the mainland of Europe. The\r\nintroduction took place, it seems, in very early times, and there is\r\nno record of the event. Peat deposits have been studied and their age\r\nestimated, and it is found that in those of the age of the neolithic\r\nmen there are no remains of spruce, but only of Scots firs!\r\n\r\nThe conifers are remarkable not only for their \"cones,\" but for the\r\nneedle-like shape which their leaves often present, whence the latter\r\nare spoken of simply as \"needles.\" Conifers are also distinguished\r\nby the fine aromatic oils which they produce in these needles and in\r\ntheir wood, which serve them as a protection against browsing animals,\r\nalthough to man their perfume is agreeable. In the Tyrol, near Cortina,\r\nI remember a little shop in the pine woods where you could buy the\r\nodorous essences extracted from the different species of conifers\r\ngrowing around, and each species had its own special perfume. Besides\r\nthese aromatic oils, the conifers produce peculiar resins, such as\r\ncolophon, amber, kauri gum, Canada balsam, Dammar varnish, and others,\r\nand also various qualities of turpentine, tar, and pitch.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the three commonest conifers which flourish in\r\nEngland, and have pointed out that only one of them--the Pinus\r\nsylvestris, or Scots fir--is really indigenous to our islands. It\r\nextends all over Europe, except the extreme south and west, and right\r\nthrough Russian Asia. In the Alps, at the height of 3000 to 5000 feet,\r\nit is represented by a dwarf recumbent species, the Pinus montana, or\r\nP. pumilio. There is another really native conifer in Britain which\r\nbelongs to a peculiar family, that of the cypresses. This is the common\r\njuniper, called by botanists \"Juniperus communis,\" a mere shrub, but\r\nstill a beautiful little thing, noticeable for the fine perfume of its\r\nleaves, which is used for flavouring \"gin,\" and for its peculiar minute\r\nand compact berry-like cones. It has a very wide range, flourishing\r\nthroughout the north temperate region of Europe, Asia, and America.\r\nThere is another juniper well known in England, namely, the Savin\r\n(Juniperus Sabina). This is not a native, but was introduced before\r\n1548. It has powerful medicinal properties.\r\n\r\nWhen we spend our holidays abroad in Switzerland or on the\r\nMediterranean shores we come across many other flourishing,\r\nwell-established kinds of pines, firs, and cypresses. And we need not\r\nleave England in order to make acquaintance with a very large number\r\nwhich have been introduced from abroad into plantations and parks,\r\nand grow under favourable circumstances, but cannot be said to have\r\nestablished themselves as naturalized inhabitants. Among those more\r\nanciently introduced is the cedar of Lebanon; of later introduction we\r\nhave the Indian cedar or deodar, and the Weymouth pine, Pinus Strobus,\r\na North American tree. Still later a veritable crowd of American,\r\nHimalayan, Japanese, and Chinese pine trees of one kind and another\r\nhave been introduced by dealers and their rich clients, the owners of\r\npark plantations, so that it is now far easier to see in the grounds\r\naround great English houses all sorts of pine trees from remote regions\r\nof the earth than the British species, or those interesting European\r\nkinds which have some kind of community with them, and are, at any\r\nrate, objects of interest to the naturalist whose familiar ground is\r\nthat of Europe. Most people are utterly perplexed by the number of\r\nkinds, and do not know one from another.\r\n\r\nIn order to discuss a little further in detail the commoner kinds\r\nof Coniferæ besides those which may be considered as truly British,\r\nand have been mentioned above, we must take a glance at the plants\r\nrelated to the natural order Coniferæ, and then at the divisions of\r\nthat natural order into families and tribes. The Coniferæ are an order\r\nof the great class of Gymnosperms--one of two classes into which the\r\nflowering plants or Phanerogams are divided, the other being (as\r\nexplained above) the Angiosperms (palms, grasses, lilies, and all\r\nour ordinary trees, shrubs, and flower-bearing herbs). The orders\r\nincluded under \"Gymnosperms\" are: First, an order, the Pterido-spermia,\r\ncomprising certain remarkable fossil forms connecting them with ferns;\r\nsecond, the order Cycadeæ, an ancient group, of which only a dozen or\r\nso kinds survive to this day; third, the order Gnetaceæ, including\r\nWellwitch's strange African plant and the little European Ephedras,\r\nresembling the plants called horse-tails; fourth, the order of the\r\nGingko trees of Japan, called also Salisburiæ, with leaves like those\r\nof the maiden's-hair fern. They and one or two others are survivors\r\nof an important extinct group (the Gingkoaceæ), which we know by their\r\nfossil remains flourished in great numbers before the chalk period.\r\nThen we have: fifth, the order Taxaceæ (or yew trees); and, sixth,\r\nthe order Coniferæ (or cypresses, pines, cedars, and firs). The first\r\nfour orders, though very interesting, exceptional plants we will leave\r\naside, as they do not come very near to the Coniferæ. The order of yew\r\ntrees, Taxaceæ, however, does come close to the Coniferæ, and sometimes\r\nthey are grouped together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--The Common Yew, Taxus baccata.\r\n\r\na, Part of a branch (of the natural size) showing the needle-like\r\nleaves in two opposite rows, and three fruits. The cup-like growth\r\nwhich is seen surrounding the naked seed is called an \"aril.\" It is of\r\na fine crimson colour, soft, juicy, and sweet-tasting.\r\n\r\nb, The young cone-like growth or \"flower\" of the yew, from the end of\r\nwhich one seed and its cup-like aril will develop.

Less highly magnified than b.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one truly native British example of the order Taxaceæ--the\r\ncommon yew tree, called \"Taxus baccata\" by botanists. Its leaves are\r\n\"needles,\" like those of most conifers, but much flattened, and it\r\nhas the sombre colour and the general aspect of some of the larger\r\nconifers. But its ovule-bearing flower, although it appears when young\r\n(Fig. 32, b) to be built up by several scale-like leaves like the cone\r\nof a conifer, does not continue in that form, and ceases to have\r\nany resemblance to a \"cone.\" Only the terminal leaf or scale of the\r\ngroup enlarges and develops an ovule, and around this grows an open\r\ncup-like protection of the most delicate crimson colour--soft, sweet,\r\nand luscious (Fig. 32, c and a). It is as big as a pea, and is largely\r\neaten by birds and by schoolboys! Yew trees have from time immemorial\r\nbeen planted and cared for in Great Britain, since its wood was\r\nformerly greatly valued for making archers' bows. Wild groves of yew\r\ntrees, once existing, have been largely destroyed. Some of the finest\r\nare on the chalk hills of Surrey, where the yew flourishes alongside\r\nof the juniper. Very fine yew trees are often found growing, one or\r\ntwo together, in village churchyards, where they have been planted in\r\nremote times, just as cypress trees are to-day planted in cemeteries in\r\nthe South of Europe. Yew trees with trunks from 30 to 50 feet in girth\r\nat 12 feet from the ground are known, and it is probable that some are\r\nas much as a thousand years old.\r\n\r\nMany varieties of the yew tree occur in these islands. A celebrated\r\nvariety is that in which the branches are all directed upwards rather\r\nthan horizontally--a frequent form of variation in trees which more\r\nusually have spreading, nearly horizontal branches. This variety is\r\ncalled \"fastigiate\" (the \"fastigiate\" condition of the common cypress\r\ntree is the one usually cultivated, although there are common varieties\r\nwith spreading branches), and in the case of the fastigiate yew it is\r\naccompanied by a variation in the disposition of the needles or leaves.\r\nInstead of being carried right and left in a single row on each side\r\nof the young branches, as is usual with yews, the needles are set all\r\nround the branch in spiral order (as they are in many conifers). This\r\nvariety was found growing wild in Co. Fermanagh, Ireland, nearly two\r\nhundred years ago, and a couple of trees of it were then cultivated at\r\nFlorence Court by the Earl of Enniskillen of that date. Thousands of\r\ncuttings have been sent from one of these two original trees, which\r\nis still vigorous (I saw it some thirty years ago at Florence Court)\r\nall over the world. It is known as the \"Florence Court yew,\" or \"Irish\r\nyew,\" and is commonly planted in gardens. But all are from cuttings\r\nof this one original tree, or cuttings of its cuttings, and all, like\r\ntheir parent, are female berry-bearing trees, for the male and female\r\nflowers grow on separate trees in the yew.\r\n\r\nThe foliage of the yew contains aromatic and other chemical products,\r\nwhich render it poisonous to cattle. It is said not to be poisonous\r\nwhen quite fresh, but only some time after cutting. This, however,\r\nneeds confirmation. The yew makes an admirably compact and impervious\r\nscreen when grown as a hedge, and has been largely used in gardens for\r\nthis purpose. In the sixteenth century it was the custom to clip yew\r\nhedges, or small yew trees, into all sorts of strange shapes, birds,\r\nbeasts, and crowns. The name \"topiary\" is given to this fanciful work.\r\nThe popularity of the yew in the gardens of those days is due to\r\nthe small number of our native evergreen shrubs and trees; they are\r\nyew, Scots fir, juniper, holly, privet, ivy, butcher's broom, box (a\r\ndoubtful native), spurge-laurel, and mistletoe. Up to the end of the\r\nseventeenth century only a few evergreens had been introduced from\r\nabroad, viz., spruce pine, silver fir, stone pine, pinaster, the cedar\r\nof Lebanon, savin, arbor vitæ, evergreen oak, sweet bay, Portugal\r\nlaurel, laurustine, and arbutus.\r\n\r\nI have often wished to have some simple, straight-forward information\r\nas to conifers, so as to be able to know what differences among them\r\nare really recognized by botanists, and what are the correct names of\r\nthose which one commonly sees. Having gathered that information, I\r\npropose to impart it, as far as may be consistent with brevity, to my\r\nreaders, though I am afraid that to some it will prove a dull business.\r\nThe order Coniferæ, from which the yew trees (Taxaceæ) are excluded,\r\nis divided into four families. These are: (1) the family Abietinæ,\r\nwhich comprises the true pines, and fir trees, and the cedars; (2)\r\nthe family Araucarianæ, which includes the Monkey puzzle of South\r\nAmerica and Australia, and the Dammar tree of New Zealand; (3) the\r\nfamily Taxodinæ, which is best known by the so-called Wellingtonia, or\r\nSequoia, but includes several other genera and species; and (4) the\r\nfamily Cupressinæ, in which the juniper, cypress, and \"arbor vitæ,\" or\r\nThuya, are placed.\r\n\r\nThe form and size of the frequently needle-like leaves of coniferæ are\r\nnot of so much importance in indicating the affinities of these plants\r\nas one might expect, although their grouping either in tufts or in rows\r\nis a matter of significance. In some of them the \"needles,\" or leaves,\r\nare long and narrow (Abietinæ); in others they are broad and leaf-like\r\n(Araucarianæ); in others they are all or most of them reduced to mere\r\nridges or short scales set quite closely to the leaf-bearing branch\r\n(many Cupressinæ and Taxodinæ). It is not possible to give, without\r\ngoing into botanical minutiæ, the items of structure by which the four\r\nfamilies of conifers are distinguished from one another. It is best for\r\nthe nature-lover who is not an adept in botanical details to think of\r\nthem as grouped each round one well-known species. Thus the Abietinæ\r\nare grouped round the spruce pine, the Araucarianæ round the monkey\r\npuzzle, the Taxodinæ round the Wellingtonia, and the Cupressinæ round\r\nthe juniper. In all but the last family the ovule-bearing scales of the\r\nfemale cone are arranged spiral-wise around a central supporting stem;\r\nin Cupressinæ they are few in number, very thick, and opposite to one\r\nanother so as to form a globular rather than a cone-shaped body. In\r\nall but a few Cupressinæ and Araucarianæ the male and female cones are\r\ncarried on the same tree, sometimes on separate branches, but usually\r\non the same branch. The male and female cones are always distinct, and\r\nthe female much the larger and more enduring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--A thin slice across one of the foliage needles\r\nof the Common Spruce.

The Norwegian\r\nspruce is the type of the genus Picea. It is called _Pesse_ by the\r\nFrench, _Fichte_ by the Germans, and Picea excelsa by botanists. We\r\nmay contrast it with the silver fir Abies pectinata (_Sapin des Vosges_\r\nof the French, _Silbertanne_ of the Germans), which we take as the\r\ntype of the genus Abies. In many respects the silver fir looks like\r\nthe spruce. In both the stem is straight, reaching a height of 100 to\r\n150 feet, regularly furnished with tiers of branches from the ground\r\nupwards. The leaves are needles, half an inch to an inch long, which\r\nstand out from the branchlets, but in the spruce they are quadrangular,\r\ngreen all over, and arise all round the branch, whilst in the silver\r\nfir they are flat, grooved on the lower surface, which is silver-grey\r\nin colour, and they tend to be disposed right and left in two rows.\r\nEach needle has a single resin canal in the spruce, but has two in\r\nthe silver fir, as may be easily seen by cutting the needles across\r\nthe length with a sharp knife (Figs. 33 and 34). Each scale-like\r\novule-producing leaf which goes to build up the ripe seed-bearing\r\ncone has (as in all conifers theoretically) an outer scale, called a\r\n\"bract,\" attached to it which is very short and hidden in the case of\r\nthe spruce cone, but is longer than the ovuliferous scale, and very\r\nobvious in the silver fir (Fig. 35). It has a triangular re-curved\r\npoint, which gives the cones of that species a characteristic\r\nappearance (Fig. 36). The cones of the silver fir (5 to 6 inches long\r\nand 2 inches thick) are set upright on the branches, and when they have\r\nshed the seeds the scales fall off rapidly and leave the axis bare,\r\nwhilst the cones of the spruce (about an inch shorter) are pendulous\r\n(Fig. 37), and their scales remain in position after the seed is shed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--The upright spine-bearing cone of the Silver\r\nFir, Abies pectinata. The cones vary from this size to one-third as\r\nlong again. (Copied from Veitch's \"Manual of the Coniferæ,\" by kind\r\npermission of Messrs. Veitch.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--a, Structure of the female cone of the Silver\r\nFir.

Such are the American white\r\nand red and black spruces, the Siberian, the Oriental, the Servian, and\r\nthe tiger's-tail Japanese spruce. Then there is the beautiful variety\r\nof the blue American spruce, Picea pungens. The blue-grey colour of the\r\nneedles is frequently obtained as a \"variety\" in the cultivation of\r\ndifferent species of conifers, as also is the yellow, or golden-leaved,\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.\r\n\r\nA, The female cone of the Common Spruce, Picea excelsa.

Enlarged.]\r\n\r\nIn the genus Abies, associated with the silver fir, are a whole series\r\nof American, Siberian, and Japanese species. An interesting one is\r\nthe Californian Abies bracteata, which has thornlike processes on the\r\ncone 2 inches in length, corresponding to the re-curved spines on the\r\ncone of the silver fir. It was introduced into England in 1853, and\r\nspecimens are growing in Eastnor Park, near Ledbury. The beautiful\r\n_pinsapo_ of the Spanish Sierra Nevada also belongs to the genus\r\nAbies, and may be seen in some English plantations. The Tsuga firs of\r\nJapan and North America are related to Abies, but are now placed in a\r\nseparate genus (Tsuga), as also is the Douglas fir of North America\r\n(Pseudotsuga), which has been extensively planted in Great Britain.\r\nThe Douglas fir is readily recognized by the decorative trifid outer\r\nscales or \"bracts\" of the rather short cone (Fig. 42). When freshly\r\ngrown these cones have beautiful purple tints mingled with pale green.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Cone and foliage (many needles in each tuft)\r\nof the Common Larch, Larix Europœa. Of the natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe larches and cedars form the second group or section of the\r\nAbietinæ, distinguished by the fact that the needle-like leaves grow\r\nin tufts of twenty to forty at the end of short stumpy branchlets\r\nor \"spurs\" (Fig. 38). In the larches, which form the genus Larix,\r\nthe needles fall off every autumn and leave the tree bare, the\r\nannually-renewed feathery foliage contrasting, by its fresh bright\r\ngreen colour, with the darker hues of the persistent needles of\r\nother conifers. The common larch (Larix Europœa) is a native of the\r\nmountainous regions of Central Europe. The French call it _Méléze_.\r\nThere are Himalayan, Japanese, and North American species. The common\r\nlarch when full-grown is 100 feet and more in height, and has the\r\nbranches arranged in whorls of diminishing length, so as to give the\r\n\"Christmas-tree shape\" so common among coniferæ. It was introduced into\r\nEngland in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe cedars closely resemble the larches, but have the leaves or\r\nneedles persistent, and the large cones take two years to ripen,\r\ninstead of one year, as in all the conifers which I have hitherto\r\nmentioned. The cedars form the genus Cedrus, and three species are\r\ndistinguished, namely: (1) C. Libani, the cedar of Lebanon; (2) C.\r\nAtlantica, the North African cedar of the Atlas mountains; and (3)\r\nC. deodara, the Himalayan cedar or deodar. They are now considered\r\nto be geographical varieties of one species. They differ chiefly in\r\nthe set of the branches and foliage. The cedar of Lebanon has the\r\ntrunk forked, and gives rise to large, unequally disposed branches,\r\nspreading horizontally; it may have a spread of 100 feet and a height\r\nof 70 feet. In this country it is often uprooted by the wind, or its\r\nbranches are broken by a weight of snow, when it has attained nearly\r\nfull growth. The deodar cedar is more Christmas-tree-like in shape,\r\nthe trunk rarely is forked, and it attains, in its native mountains, a\r\nheight of 250 feet. The Atlas cedar is in many respects intermediate\r\nin character between C. Libani and C. deodara. The cedar of Lebanon is\r\nundoubtedly the most majestic of the conifers grown in English parks.\r\nIt was introduced in the year 1665. There are specimens growing in this\r\ncountry of which the trunk has a girth of 25 feet.\r\n\r\nThe third section of the family Abietinæ is formed by the genus Pinus,\r\nof which the Scots fir, or Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris), is the\r\ntype. The Abietinæ of this genus are distinguished by their foliage.\r\nThere are two kinds of leaves--the primitive ones, which are little,\r\nscale-like, green up-growths closely scattered on the young branches;\r\nand the secondary ones, which are long needles carried as a tuft\r\nor fascicle on a very stumpy branchlet. These tufts of needles are\r\npersistent (that is to say, are not shed yearly), and differ from those\r\nof the larches and cedars in consisting of but few needles in a tuft,\r\nthe number being characteristic of different species, some having\r\nfive, others three, others two, and the American Pinus monophylla\r\nhaving only one. The general shape of these trees is not tapering\r\nlike the spruce with unforked trunk, but they usually shed the lower\r\nbranches as growth goes on, and present in most cases a trunk carrying\r\nan umbrella-like expanse of foliage-bearing branches, or several such\r\nexpanses. The scales which form the cones in the genus Pinus are (with\r\nfew exceptions, such as the Weymouth pine) not flat and flexible, but\r\nare thickened, swollen, and even knob-like and wooden at the exposed\r\npart, which is armed with a weak or a strong prickle (see Figs. 39,\r\n40, and 41). The cones do not ripen until the end of the second or\r\nthird season; they may be, according to species, erect, pendulous,\r\nor horizontal, and vary in size in different species. In some they\r\nremain closed on the trees for an indefinite period (even fifteen or\r\ntwenty years), until opened by the heat of a forest fire or of an\r\nexceptionally hot season.\r\n\r\nThe Scots fir, Pinus sylvestris (Fig. 31), called _Pin de Genève_ by\r\nthe French, has a very wide range. It extends eastward and northward\r\nfrom the Sierra Nevada, in Spain, through Europe and Russian Asia; its\r\nnorthern limit approaches the Arctic circle, its southern limit is\r\nformed by the great mountain chains of the Alps, Caucasus, and Altai\r\nrange of Asia. The beautiful blue-green colour of its needles, the fine\r\nred-brown tint of its trunk and branches, and the graceful spread of\r\nits foliage high up on a few great, unequally-grown branches springing\r\nfrom its tall, bare trunk, are amongst the most picturesque features\r\nof English landscape. In the southern counties \"clumps\" of a dozen or\r\nscore of these graceful trees are often to be seen on some isolated\r\nhilltop in the moorlands, and are associated with poetic tradition and\r\nancient superstition. In the North of Britain they are more frequent\r\nas forest. The Scots fir is the only pine tree really native in our\r\nland. It is distinguished from several other species of Pinus by having\r\nthe leaves or needles in bundles of two, and having relatively small\r\noblong cones (2 to 3 inches long) which are borne near the ends of\r\nthe branches (Fig. 31). The constituent scales of the cone are only\r\nslightly thickened, and the surface knob has no prickle. There are\r\ntwo of the common pine trees of the Mediterranean coast (the Riviera\r\nand elsewhere), namely, the Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) and the\r\nso-called Corsican or Austrian pine (Pinus Laricio), which agree in the\r\nabove-given points with the Scots fir, and are, in fact, difficult to\r\ndistinguish from it, except by general shape, mode of growth, and the\r\ncolour of the leaves and stem. The needles of the Scots fir are 1½ to\r\n3 inches long, those of P. halepensis 2½ to 3½ inches, and those of P.\r\nLaricio 4 to 6 inches long. The Pyrenæan or Calabrian pine is closely\r\nsimilar to these.\r\n\r\nA very important and abundant pine on the Mediterranean and Biscay\r\ncoast of France is the Pinaster (Pinus pinaster), often called the\r\n\"cluster pine,\" and by the French _Pin des Landes_ and _Pin maritime_\r\n(Fig. 39). It also has its needles, often 6 inches long, in groups of\r\ntwo. It is usually a smaller tree than the others, but in favourable\r\nlocalities attains a height of 80 feet. Its cones are twice as long as\r\nthose of the Scots fir, often, as at Bournemouth, 4 and even 5 inches\r\nlong, and its branches are slender in proportion to the trunk, the bark\r\ncoarse and fissured, and its foliage (as is that of all the two-leaved\r\nset except the Scots fir) of a yellowish (not bluish) green. It has\r\nbeen found invaluable in holding sandy land from shifting and breaking\r\nup, and is planted for this purpose along the coast of the Landes and\r\nin other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Female Cone of the Pinaster, or Maritime\r\nPine (Pinus pinaster). Drawn of the natural size from a Bournemouth\r\nspecimen.]\r\n\r\nA still better-known pine, which, like those already mentioned, has its\r\nneedles in pairs, is the stone pine (Pinus pinea), called by the French\r\n_Pin de parasol_ and by the Italians _Pino a pinocchi_. This fine tree\r\n(usually bigger than the Pinaster) has been largely planted in Italy on\r\naccount of its picturesque appearance. This is the tree which one sees\r\nso often in Turner's landscapes. The needles are 5 to 6 inches long,\r\nand the cones are very large and almost spherical, being often 5 inches\r\nlong and 4 inches in diameter. The cones do not mature until the third\r\nyear. The scales are very large and solid, which renders it difficult\r\nto extract the nut-like seeds, which are roasted and eaten. Hence the\r\nname stone-pine. The spreading, parasol-like shape of the stone-pine is\r\ncharacteristic. A few specimens are to be seen in cultivation in this\r\ncountry. In order to distinguish Pinus sylvestris from P. halepensis,\r\nlaricio, pinaster, and pinea, the deep blue-green colour of the foliage\r\nof the first is sufficient, together with the shortness of its needles.\r\nTo distinguish the others among themselves (except in the case of\r\nwell-grown typical examples) it is necessary to examine the cones\r\nclosely, and often when one comes upon these trees they are, on account\r\nof the season, devoid of these distinguishing products.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Female Cone of the Monterey Pine of California\r\n(Pinus insignis). Of the natural size, but somewhat larger specimens\r\nare frequent. The characteristic three foliage needles in a bunch,\r\nin place of two or five distinctive of some other species of Pinus,\r\nare shown in the drawing on the left.--(From Veitch's \"Manual of\r\nConiferæ.\")]\r\n\r\nWide tracts of sandy moorland in the south of England have been in\r\nthe last century extensively planted with various species of Pinus,\r\nand afford the naturalist an interesting opportunity for comparing\r\none with another. At Bournemouth the plantations are chiefly of the\r\nAustrian variety of Pinus Laricio,[15] the Scots P. sylvestris, and\r\nthe Mediterranean Pinaster. The latter is especially luxuriant there.\r\nHere and there I have found other species at Bournemouth. A remarkable\r\none with three needles in a group is the Californian Pinus insignis\r\n(Fig. 40), known as the Monterey pine. It has a very large cone which\r\nis curiously one-sided in growth, the seed-scales on the side facing\r\naway from the supporting branch being larger than those on the opposite\r\nface. Another interesting species to be met with there is the Pinus\r\nmuricata, also a Californian sea-coast species. The cones of this\r\nspecies are about 3 inches long and half that in breadth. In all\r\nthe species of Pinus the outer end of the scales which build up the\r\ncone is swollen and squeezed compactly by its fellows, forming a hard\r\nshield-like surface of a lozenge shape, in the middle of which is a\r\nknob or process (see Figs. 31, 39, and 40). Usually this is short and\r\nnot very sharp, but in Pinus muricata the cone is very hard and solid\r\nand the knob is elongated into a spine of nearly one-third of an inch\r\nlong (Fig. 41). Theses pines are so hard and sharp that they render it\r\nimpossible to grasp the cone with the hand in order to pluck it. The\r\ncones remain on the tree for fifteen years or more, and may be seen\r\nin close-set clusters surrounding quite old branches. The cones of\r\nPinus rigida--one of the American pitch-pines--are similarly protected\r\nby spines. Pinus rigida is easily distinguished by its having its\r\nneedles in bundles of three from Pinus muricata, which has the more\r\nusual arrangement of a pair of needles to each bundle. The Douglas\r\nfir is also to be found here and there in the gardens and parks of\r\nBournemouth. Its cones (Fig. 42) are remarkable for their beautiful\r\npurple and pale green tints when young, and for the long trifid bract\r\non the outside of each scale, similar to but larger than those on the\r\ncone-scales of the silver fir, Abies pectinata (Fig. 35), and not bent\r\nbackwards as they are.\r\n\r\n[15] A fine specimen is growing near the main entrance of Kew Gardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Female Cone of Pinus muricata, showing the\r\nlong sharp spines which stand up from the boss or umbo in the centre of\r\nthe swollen, woody, lozenge-shaped end or \"apex\" of each seed-scale.\r\nCompare these with the un-armed bosses in the centre of each lozenge\r\nbuilding up the surface of the cones drawn in Figs. 31, 39, and 40.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Female Cone of the Douglas Fir of North-West\r\nAmerica (Oregon and Vancouver), Pseudotsuga Douglasii. Of the natural\r\nsize.--(From Veitch.)]\r\n\r\nThere are two pine trees of the genus Pinus which one comes across,\r\neither in English plantations or on the Continent, and are readily\r\ndistinguished by having the leaves (needles) in bundles of five. The\r\nfirst of these is the Arolla pine--Pinus Cembra (French, _cembrot_)--a\r\npine tree much like the Scots fir in general appearance, but\r\ndistinguishable from it, not only by the tufts of five needles in a\r\nbunch instead of two, but also by the erect cones which are nearly as\r\nbroad as long (3 in. by 2 in.). It is essentially a Siberian tree, and\r\ngrows in Europe only on the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps. I have\r\nseen it in the neighbourhood of the Rhone Valley in Switzerland, but it\r\nis yearly becoming rarer owing to its destruction at the great heights\r\n(4000 to 6000 feet), where it formerly flourished, by the herdsmen in\r\norder to extend the pasturage for their milk industry. The other pine\r\nwith five leaves in a tuft, which one may often see, is the Weymouth\r\npine--Pinus Strobus. It is a native of the New England States and\r\nCanada, where it is known as the white pine, and is greatly valued as a\r\ntimber tree. It was introduced and planted in England by Lord Weymouth\r\nat the beginning of the eighteenth century, and is a very handsome\r\ntree, growing to 120 feet in height, with a bluish-green colour of the\r\nfoliage like that of the Scots fir. The needles are 3 to 4 inches long,\r\nand the cones pendulous, 5 to 6 inches long and blunt. Another pine of\r\nthe five-leaved group is to be seen in gardens in the South of Europe\r\n(for instance at Baveno on the Lago Maggiore), where it is introduced\r\nfrom Mexico. This is the Pinus Montezumæ, which has extraordinarily\r\nlong tufts of needles of a blue-green colour, each needle from 7 to\r\n10 inches long, arranged as radiating or fan-like growths of great\r\nbeauty and striking appearance. The Bohtan pine of the Himalayas (Pinus\r\nexcelsa--not to be confused with Picea excelsa, the spruce) is also a\r\nfive-leaved species. Several specimens of it are flourishing in Kew\r\nGardens.\r\n\r\nA few lines must be given to the Araucarianæ, Taxodinæ, and Cupressinæ.\r\nThe Araucarianæ include, besides the Chilian monkey puzzle, an\r\nAustralian species, and the New Zealand Dammar pine Agathis, which\r\nproduces the amber-like Kauri gum. The leaves of the monkey puzzle are\r\nlike the scales of a spruce cone in shape, and the ordinary branches\r\nare like elongated green spruce-cones, whilst the seed-cones have\r\nneedle-like scales. The next family, the Taxodinæ, are in many respects\r\nintermediate in character, between the Abietinæ (true pines, cedars,\r\nand firs) and the Cupressinæ (cypresses and junipers). They have very\r\nsmall, lance-shaped leaves, closely packed, so as to overlap one\r\nanother--as in the celebrated Wellingtonia or American Big-tree--and\r\nsmall cones, with hard, knob-like scales, resembling those of the most\r\nwoody-coned Pinus, but few in number. The American Big-tree (native on\r\nthe western slopes of the Californian Sierra Nevada) is named \"Sequoia\r\ngigantea\" by the botanists. It was introduced into England about sixty\r\nyears ago. The Red-wood, of the Pacific coast of the United States,\r\nis another species of Sequoia (S. sempervirens), and it appears that\r\na specimen of it has been measured as reaching 340 feet in height;\r\nwhilst no living specimen of the S. gigantea has been definitely\r\nmeasured of more than 325 feet in height. There are several other\r\nlarge exotic, pine-like trees, which are placed in the Taxodinæ. The\r\nextraordinary and interesting tree called the Japanese umbrella pine\r\n(Sciadopitys verticillata) is associated with the Sequoias by some\r\nbotanists; but it is in important respects unlike any other conifer.\r\nIt has a very peculiar foliage, namely, rod-like leaflets, twenty to\r\nthirty in number, arranged in circlets or whorls like the spokes or\r\nribs of an umbrella. The curious thing is that these are not \"leaves,\"\r\nbut, according to botanists, are leaf-like shoots or branchlets! It may\r\nbe seen growing in Kew Gardens, where it was introduced thirty years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThe last family of the Coniferæ is the Cupressinæ, so named after\r\nthe great and beautiful cypress tree, which is said to have given\r\nits name to the island of Cyprus, which in turn gives its name to\r\ncupreous metal, or copper. The cypress tree similarly gives its name\r\nto \"coffers\" and \"coffins\" made of its wood, as the Buxus or box-tree\r\nhas given its name to a \"box.\" The cypress is the Gopher tree of the\r\nHebrews. The family includes many species of junipers (Juniperus) and\r\nthe American and Japanese Arbor vitæ (Thuya) and its allies. In the\r\ncommon cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) the leaves are singular, small,\r\nscale-like growths, which are flattened on to the delicate branchlets\r\nwhich bear them. In other trees of the family both such leaves and also\r\nupstanding lancet-like leaves are present. The main character is the\r\nsmall size and globular shape of the cones and the very few swollen\r\nscales, more like solid wedges adherent to one another, which build\r\nthem up. These wedge-like scales are not arranged in whorls, but are\r\nopposite to one another on the short axis or stem of the cone. The\r\ncommon juniper (Juniperus communis), the _génévrier_ of the French,\r\ngrows abundantly on the chalk downs of the South of England, where\r\nit appears as a small bush, not exceeding 5 feet in height, but in\r\nfavourable conditions reaches a height of 20 feet. The cones of the\r\njuniper are numerous, and each consists of only three ovuliferous\r\nscales, and is only one-fifth of an inch in diameter when ripe, and of\r\na blackish violet colour.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this compressed survey of the order Coniferæ, let me\r\nput the chief forms and groups at which we have looked in a tabular\r\nform, thus:\r\n\r\n  =Order CONIFERÆ:=\r\n\r\n  _FAMILY_ 1.--ABIETINÆ.\r\n    SECTION A.--SAPINEÆ (SPRUCES AND SILVER FIRS).\r\n      _Genus_ 1.--Picea. 2.

This arises from the fact that the lymph is translucent and\r\ncolourless. You can see the finest blood-vessels when the body of a\r\ndead rat, sheep, or man is opened, because they are filled with the\r\nbeautiful red blood, and appear as a rich, coloured network. But the\r\nlymph and the lymph-vessels escape notice, and, indeed, are invisible\r\nexcept the largest, because they are colourless. They remained unknown\r\nto anatomists long after arteries and veins, and the fine networks of\r\nhair-like vessels or capillaries connecting them, were thoroughly well\r\nstudied. It is, when one thinks of it, a very noteworthy fact, tending\r\nto convince us of the readiness with which we may (in the absence of\r\ncareful examination and attention) overlook the most weighty things,\r\nthat here is a great system of vessels and spaces in the human body\r\nand in that of other animals, carrying on most important operations in\r\nour daily life, and yet most of us have never seen any evidence of its\r\nexistence, and never hold it in our mind's eye as part of the great\r\nmechanism of the animal body.\r\n\r\nThe lymph is a clear, colourless fluid, with \"corpuscles\"--minute\r\nnucleated cells or particles of protoplasm--floating in it. The liquid\r\npart is closely similar in its properties and chemical constitution\r\nto the liquid part of the blood. It, indeed, consists largely of\r\nthe liquid part of the blood which exudes from the finest hair-like\r\nblood-vessels or capillaries as they traverse the various tissues, and\r\nit is the chief business of the \"lymphatics\" or lymph-holding vessels\r\nto return this exuded liquid to the blood system, which they do by\r\njoining--like the rivulets of a river system--to form two large trunks\r\nwhich open into the great blood-holding veins at the region where\r\nthey approach the heart. The total amount of lymph in the lymphatic\r\nsystem is difficult to estimate, but it is larger in quantity than\r\nthe blood in the entire blood-vascular system. A large number of the\r\ndelicate vessels of the lymphatic system take their origin just below\r\nthe lining layer of the intestine, and ramify through the transparent\r\nmembrane, which holds the coils of intestine together, and is called\r\nthe mesentery. The fatty or oily materials of food pass through the\r\nlining \"cells\" of the intestinal wall into these \"lacteal\" or milky\r\nlymphatics, and consequently in an animal killed and examined after a\r\nmeal, the fluid in them has a milky appearance, and renders this kind\r\nof \"lymphatics\" visible.\r\n\r\nThey were for this reason the first to be detected, and were known even\r\nin ancient times to anatomists. The milky fluid in them was called \"the\r\nchyle.\" Its milky appearance is due to the same cause as the white\r\nopaque appearance of milk, namely, to the presence of an immense number\r\nof excessively small particles of oil (fat) and a certain proportion\r\nof larger globules of the same nature. It was thus not difficult\r\nfor the old anatomists to trace the fine branches of the lacteals\r\nuniting branch to branch, and at last forming a large trunk--called\r\nthe thoracic duct--about a quarter of an inch thick, which runs up\r\nthe inner face of the backbone to the neck, where it joins the great\r\nleft subclavian vein, and pours its contents into the blood-stream\r\nwhich is there nearing the heart. A small trunk formed by the union\r\nof lymphatic vessels from the right side of the head and neck and the\r\nright upper limb opens into the right subclavian vein. It took some\r\ntime to discover this smaller trunk, since it is not brought to view by\r\nmilky contents. Gradually it was made out that there are innumerable\r\ntransparent branches opening into the thoracic duct from the whole of\r\nthe body, besides the milky-looking lacteals: branches which bring\r\n\"limpid\" clear fluid, or \"lymph,\" from all the viscera, from the\r\nmuscles, and from the deeper layers of the skin in every region of the\r\nbody, even from the toes, fingers, and tongue tip. In fact, wherever\r\nthe blood-vessels take blood there are also vessels of the lymphatic\r\nsystem bringing back to the heart the liquid exudation which escapes\r\ninto the tissues from the finest blood-vessels (Fig. 43).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--The fore-arm of man, with the skin removed\r\nso as to show the large superficial lymphatic vessels resting on the\r\nmuscles. They are represented as white knotted cords. On the palm of\r\nthe hand (8, 8) and on the fingers a closer network of these vessels is\r\nrepresented, but the smaller lymphatic capillaries and spaces are not\r\nshown.]\r\n\r\nWhilst we distinguish in an animal body various \"tissues\" which have\r\nspecial properties and activities, and can be dissected out and\r\ndelimited--as we could dissect and distinguish the \"tissues\" (flannel,\r\nsilk, leather, whalebone, wadding, gold-thread, etc.) making up an\r\nelaborate padded, stiffened brocaded, lined, and decorated costume--we\r\nfind that, unlike what is usual in a man-made costume, all the parts\r\nof an animal body (viscera, and their lobes and sub-divisions,\r\nthe blood-vessels, nerves, muscles, bones, etc.), are covered and\r\nseparated from one another, and, at the same time, held together by\r\na ubiquitous soft, spongy tissue, consisting of delicate threads and\r\nbands, enclosing spaces--some excessively minute and narrow, others\r\nlarger--in which is a liquid. This is the great packing tissue of the\r\nbody, and is called \"the connective tissue.\" Its threads and bands\r\nhave delicate, usually flat nucleated corpuscles (so-called \"cells\")\r\nof transparent protoplasm resting upon them and bathed by the liquid\r\nin the fine spaces. The threads and bands are, indeed, the product of\r\nthe protoplasmic cells, built or \"spun\" by them, laid down by them as a\r\nsnail leaves a slimy smear behind it as it crawls. It is not difficult\r\nto cut out transparent pieces of this \"connective tissue\" from a\r\nrecently killed animal and to examine it with a very high power of the\r\nmicroscope. You may then see the living protoplasmic corpuscles slowly\r\n\"streaming\" and changing shape, and sometimes dividing (one into two)\r\nso as to form new corpuscles.\r\n\r\nI made my first acquaintance with them when I was a student at\r\nVienna with the great microscopist Stricker. We used the glass-clear\r\nconnective tissue which forms the \"cornea\" of the eye, cut from a\r\nfreshly killed frog. In those days the part taken by these cells in\r\ninflammation was being discovered, the name \"phagocyte\" had not been\r\ninvented, the part played by them and by bacteria in disease and\r\nthe suppuration of wounds was unknown, and I had the privilege of\r\nintroducing Lister's earliest researches on aseptic surgery and on the\r\ncoagulation of the blood to the notice of my friend and teacher.\r\n\r\nThis ubiquitous \"connective tissue\" underlying the skin, pushing its\r\nway into and around every part of every structure in the body, is the\r\n\"source\"--the reservoir, as it were--from which the lymph stream and\r\nthe finest lymphatic vessels take their origin. The question may very\r\nnaturally be asked, \"How is it that the lymph flows along the channels\r\nprovided by the transparent lymph vessels and is poured through 'the\r\nthoracic duct' into the great vein near the heart?\" If we inject a\r\nsuitable coloured fluid by means of a needle-pointed syringe into any\r\nmass of connective tissue, we can see the fluid pass into the numerous\r\nlymph vessels previously invisible, and if we inject into them a\r\nweak solution of silver nitrate we can, subsequently by aid of the\r\nmicroscope, make out the structure of the walls of the lymphatics and\r\nthe lining pavement cells which become stained of a brown colour by\r\nthe silver when exposed to light. But there is no muscular envelope,\r\nnothing like \"a lymph-heart\" in mammals, to drive the lymph along.\r\nThere are valves or flexible flaps in the walls of the lymph-vessels,\r\nas there are in the veins, and the lymph is driven to the heart by the\r\nintermittent pressure upon these valved tubes, caused by the movements\r\nof the muscles and of the body generally. The valves, like those of\r\nthe veins, prevent the flow of the lymph backwards, but allow it to\r\npass forward towards the heart. This is shown by the examination of a\r\nnarcotized mammal (killed immediately after the examination has been\r\nmade). A glass tube is placed in the thoracic duct, and about a dozen\r\ndrops of lymph (which would have been delivered into the great vein)\r\npass from it in a minute. If, however, the animal's legs are moved,\r\nas though in running, or if \"massage\" is applied to the limbs--the\r\npressure being directed from the extremities towards the heart--then\r\na greatly increased flow of lymph is observed, as much as sixty drops\r\nin a minute! This is the chief explanation of the value to our health\r\nof exercise, and also of the importance of \"massage\" as a treatment in\r\ndisease. Either exercise or massage entirely revolutionizes the rate\r\nof flow of the lymph, quickening it so greatly that the physiological\r\neffect on the general chemical processes going on in the body cannot\r\nfail to be most important.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, whilst mammals have to depend entirely on pressure\r\nand exercise for anything but the slowest flow of the lymph, the\r\ncold-blooded vertebrates, fish, amphibia and reptiles (and even some\r\nbirds), have remarkable, rhythmically contracting, muscular sacs,\r\nwhich pump the lymph from large lymph-vessels into large veins, and\r\nare called \"lymphatic hearts.\" The eel and other fish have them in the\r\ntail, but they are best seen in the common frog. There is an anterior\r\npair, one under each shoulder-blade, and another pair, one on each hip.\r\nEach opens at one end into a large \"collecting\" lymph-vessel, and at\r\nthe other end into a large vein. They \"beat\" like a heart, but do not\r\nkeep time with one another. Their muscular walls are formed by what is\r\ncalled \"striated\" muscular tissue (as are those of the blood-heart),\r\nand they are under the control of branches of the spinal nerves. The\r\nmovement of the hinder pair in a frog can be seen through the skin.\r\n\r\nIn man and all vertebrate animals the intestines, stomach and liver,\r\nheart and lungs (or swim-bladder) lie loose, except for a fibrous\r\nband of attachment, in a great cavity (often divided into two or more\r\nchambers), which they fit fairly closely. The small space between them\r\nand the walls of the cavity is occupied by a liquid. This is lymph, and\r\nthe great cavity is a lymph-space. When this cavity is in its primitive\r\nform it is called the body cavity, or \"cœlom.\" In man and mammals it\r\nis divided into four chief chambers--the peritoneal cavity (in which\r\nthe stomach, intestine, and liver are loosely attached and have a\r\ncertain mobility), the right pleural and left pleural cavity (one for\r\neach lung), and the pericardial cavity (for the heart). These great\r\nchambers are part of the lymph-system, and so is the lymph-holding\r\nspace around and within the brain and spinal cord, and so are the great\r\nspaces beneath the frog's skin.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the structure of an earth-worm or of one of the graceful\r\nmarine worms (Nereis or Arenicola), we gain a good deal of light as\r\nto the nature of the lymphatic system of Vertebrates. Suppose you\r\nhave killed a large earth-worm with chloroform! Then pin it out on\r\na cork plate, and open it by a cut along the back with a fine pair\r\nof scissors. The point of your scissors passes through the muscular\r\nbody-wall of the worm into a great chamber filled with a clear\r\nliquid. This chamber is the \"cœlom,\" and is the same structure as\r\nthe pleural and peritoneal chambers of the Vertebrate. But it holds\r\n(proportionately) more liquid. The liquid is \"lymph,\" like that of\r\nthe Vertebrate, and has numerous protoplasmic cells floating in it.\r\nThere is comparatively little connective tissue in the earth-worm. The\r\ncœlom is free and unblocked--the great viscera lie in it. There are\r\nsome delicate, transparent bands of connective tissue, but not much nor\r\nbulky. The wall of the cœlom itself is lined with connective tissue,\r\nand if that tissue grew greatly in bulk, and bound all the organs and\r\nmuscles together, it would reduce the large cavity, filling it up with\r\nspongy tissue in the small interstices of which there would be lymph.\r\nAnd so we should get a lymph system resembling that of Vertebrates,\r\ninstead of one large chamber.\r\n\r\nBut what about the opening of the lymphatics into the blood-vessels?\r\nThis is one of the interesting differences between the earth-worm and\r\nthe Vertebrate. The earthworm and many marine worms have a beautiful\r\nsystem of vessels, containing a bright red blood, and forming true\r\ncapillaries, connecting arteries and veins. The heart is a long,\r\nrhythmically beating tube, extending along the whole length of the\r\nanimal just above the intestine. There is no opening into it of the\r\nlymph-cavity. It is purely a respiratory blood-system, pumping its\r\nfluid, coloured red by oxygen-seizing hæmoglobin into every part of\r\nthe body. It passes along the fine capillaries of the skin, where it\r\nseizes oxygen from the outside air or water and carries it to all the\r\ntissues. The fact is that the red respiratory element of the blood\r\nwhich we call the \"hæma\" or hæmal portion (the Greek word for red\r\nblood is αἷμα) is here kept separate from the nourishing and\r\nelaborating element, the lymph or lymphatic portion. So that we should,\r\nto be explicit, describe the blood of a vertebrate as \"hæmolymph,\" a\r\nconjunction of hæma and lymph, which in the more primitive earth-worm\r\nand sea-worm have never effected a junction! In some closely allied\r\nmarine worms, however, a junction of these two is effected in another\r\nway. We know that in the Vertebrates the red blood corpuscles are\r\nformed by detached bits of the same tissue, which becomes converted\r\ninto capillaries, the finest blood-vessels. Now in several marine\r\nChætopods or bristle-footed worms (Glycera, Capitella, etc.) the\r\ntissue which should form the blood-vascular system and its red liquid\r\nblood, changes its mode of growth; it never forms blood-vessels at\r\nall, but divides into free red (hæmoglobinous) cells or red blood\r\ncorpuscles, which float in the lymph of the cœlom. There is no\r\nblood-vascular system produced in these worms, but the \"cells\" of the\r\ntissue which would in other worms form blood-vessels break up into red\r\ncorpuscles, which, mixing with the lymph, bring it into the condition\r\nof \"hæmolymph,\" identical with the blood of Vertebrates!\r\n\r\nIn the molluscs, snails, whelks, oysters, clams, and cuttle-fishes\r\nthere is a further, variation. The same two fluids and two systems of\r\nspaces are present as in the earth-worm, but the cœlomic space and\r\nfluid have been nearly blocked up and obliterated by the swelling-up\r\nand great size of the proper hæmal vessels. Only in rare cases is the\r\nblood of molluscs coloured red by hæmoglobin, usually it is of a pale\r\nblue colour. There is still left a pericardial cœlom, a space around\r\nthe heart, and from this some fine lymph-holding vessels ramify amongst\r\nthe tissues, but the chief spaces in the body are dilated parts of the\r\ntrue hæmal system. In Insects and Crustacea (say cockroach and lobster)\r\nthis process is carried still further. The great cœlom, so well\r\ndeveloped in the Chætopod worms, and the Sea-urchins and Star-fishes,\r\nand retaining quite a large development also in the Vertebrates, is\r\nnowhere to be found. The swollen blood-vessels have squeezed it out\r\nof existence, except for certain sack-like remnants which enclose\r\nseparately the ovaries, and the testes, and the kidneys, and have each\r\nits opening to the exterior conveying the products of those important\r\norgans to the outer world. Thus we gain a brief insight into the true\r\nhistory of the lymphatic system and its vicissitudes in the lower\r\nanimals and in man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE BLOOD AND ITS CIRCULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nRED, crimson, scarlet, hot, the river of life, the carrier of all that\r\nis good and all that is bad by its myriad streams through our bodies;\r\nthe rarest, most precious, most gorgeous of fluids; the daughter of\r\nthe salt ocean, finer and more worshipful even than the waters of the\r\ngreat mother, the sea; the badge of horror and of accursed cruelty, yet\r\nalso the emblem of nobility, of generosity, of all that is near and\r\ndear, of all that is splendid and beautiful; the blush of modesty and\r\nthe flag of rage; the giver of coral lips and glowing cheeks to youth\r\nand health, and no less of the ruddy nose which women hide with powder\r\nand men bravely bear without concealment! Such is the blood, and it\r\nis no wonder that the mere sight of it has always had an overpowering\r\nfascination for mankind.\r\n\r\nThe wild people of the Solomon Islands, when they see a drop of blood\r\nflowing from an accidental scratch of hand or foot, say, \"I must go\r\nhome; some danger is at hand; the blood has come to tell me!\" Sorcerers\r\nand witches of all times have endeavoured to procure a few drops of\r\nthe blood of their intended victims in order to \"work spells\" upon\r\nthe precious fluid, and so, according to the theory of \"contagious\r\nmagic,\" upon the person from which it came. In Italy to-day, as in\r\nthis country a few hundred years ago, when some one's nose bleeds, a\r\nLatin hymn to the blood (beautiful in its conception) begging it to\r\nstay its flow, as it did when the soldier's spear pierced the side of\r\nthe crucified Christ, is sung. In a village in the hills near Naples I\r\nwas taken with an attack of nose-bleeding, and bathed my head with cold\r\nwater from a pretty fountain which supplied the people with its pure\r\nstream. The women brought handsome old brass basins and embroidered\r\ncloths of the most delicate linen for my use. I heard a strange\r\nchanting behind my back as I stooped over the water, and when the\r\nbleeding had ceased I found that an old man of the village had placed\r\ntwo straws in the form of the cross on my shoulders, and was reciting\r\nthe ancient Latin hymn to my overflowing blood! I obtained afterwards\r\nfrom a friend the words of the same hymn as used in long-ago days in\r\nEnglish villages.\r\n\r\nOne primitive race if not others, namely, the Australians, take a\r\nvery prosaic and business-like view of the blood. They use it as an\r\nadhesive--a sort of liquid paste or gum, always ready to hand! In order\r\nto fasten feathers or other decoration to a pole, the Australian \"black\r\nfellow,\" without wincing or hesitation, and as a matter of course,\r\nmakes a cut (with a sharp piece of stone or glass) in his own arm, and\r\nuses the convenient blood. It also serves them as paint, as it has\r\nserved many a chieftain of European race for signing his name, and many\r\na prisoner for writing in the absence of ink.\r\n\r\nThere is for some people a fascination in the sight of blood which\r\nmust not be mistaken for cruelty, although it is accompanied by\r\ndangerous and undesirable emotion. Just as other emotion-producing\r\nexperiences--such as the sight or hearing of torture, of hairbreadth\r\nescapes, and of ghosts--produces uncontrollable repulsion and horror\r\nin some people, and to others (or even to the same people when in\r\nanother state of health or mental balance) actually gives a pleasurable\r\nsensation (exquisite shudderings, as the French say), so does the sight\r\nof blood or even the mere hearing of the word \"blood\" act differently\r\non different people. Every one who has witnessed a Spanish bull-fight\r\nknows that it is not any desire for, or enjoyment of, the sight of pain\r\nwhich excites the crowded mass of spectators. There is no \"cruelty,\"\r\nin the proper sense, in their state of mind, no pleasure in witnessing\r\npain--a thing which, terrible as it is to think of, yet does exist\r\nnaturally in mankind, and has to be, and is, repressed and absolutely\r\ngot rid of in the course of the humanizing education of civilized\r\nmankind. The spectators of the Spanish bull-fight are primarily under\r\nthe spell or fascination of the sight of blood, and in a less degree\r\nthey are attracted by the wonderful exhibition of skill and strength\r\non the part of the matador and his troop. The crowd excitedly acclaims\r\nthe first drops of blood which the splendid bull is made to shed. They\r\nbuy, after he has been killed, the paper-winged darts smeared with\r\nhis blood. The colour, the mystery, and the magnificence of blood\r\nproduces in them a violent emotion. It is to them a delight, but only\r\na single step separates their delight from pain and actual physical\r\ndistress. The most absolutely nauseating smells are very nearly\r\nidentical with delightful perfumes, and we all know how readily a taste\r\nmay be acquired converting the former into the latter--as in the case\r\nof the (to most people) foul-smelling East Indian fruit, the durian,\r\nand of rotten cheese and \"high\" game. We also know that a sudden\r\nrevulsion of \"feeling\" may occur in regard to hitherto approved smells\r\nand flavours, so that headache, vomiting, and even fainting may be\r\nproduced by a smell or flavour which was previously found a favourite\r\nbeyond all others.\r\n\r\nSo it is with this great and mysterious thing--the blood. The sight\r\nof it nearly always produces emotion and excitement, but if these\r\nemotions are not accompanied by an unreasoning joy and delight, they\r\nmay result in equally unreasoning and uncontrollable disgust, horror,\r\nand often a sudden and unaccountable collapse. Some time ago in a\r\npopular lecture on the colouring matter of the blood I had no sooner\r\nsaid the word \"blood\" than a gentleman in the front row fainted and had\r\nto be carried out. Men are more susceptible to this curious effect of\r\nthe sight or thought of blood than women. Often they do not know that\r\nthey are so, and are as astonished and perplexed by the sudden fainting\r\nas are onlookers and as are, for the matter of that, physiologists and\r\npsychologists. It is a common experience of medical men who vaccinate\r\nadults, when there is a scare about smallpox, that at the sight of a\r\ntiny drop of blood caused by scratching the arm with a lancet, men\r\nfrequently faint, whilst women rarely do so. Great, burly, red-coated\r\nsoldiers, and also athletic schoolboys, have been especially noted\r\nas fainting when vaccinated. Maid-servants rarely faint under this\r\nabsurdly trivial ordeal, whilst the butler and the valet much more\r\nfrequently do so. Here is, indeed, a curious and unexpected difference\r\nbetween men and women which I commend to the consideration of those who\r\nare discussing the desirability of admitting women to the parliamentary\r\nfranchise. It is an unexplained instance of the influence of the mind\r\non the body, and until it is better understood, one must not conclude\r\nthat the difference is a proof of superior fitness for participation in\r\npolitical affairs.\r\n\r\nI trust that none of my readers may suddenly faint on reading this\r\npage, but should be glad to hear of any experience of the kind. It\r\nis readily understood when the profound impression produced by the\r\ncolour of man's blood is considered, that the great inquirer Aristotle\r\nand a good many uninquiring people of the present day should overlook\r\nthe fact that the lower animals have blood. The insects, crustaceans,\r\nmussels, clams, snails, and cuttle-fish, and many worms have true\r\nblood and a heart and blood-vessels, but in most of them the blood\r\nis colourless, or of a very pale blue tint. Hence, like the lymph\r\ndescribed in the preceding chapter, it escapes attention, and Aristotle\r\ncalled them all \"blood-less animals.\" The fact is, however, that not\r\nonly do they possess colourless or pale blue blood, but that the\r\nbristle-footed worms (earth-worms and river-worms and marine Annelids)\r\nand even the leeches possess bright red blood contained in a complete\r\nbranching network of blood-vessels, whilst here and there among the\r\notherwise colourless-blooded molluscs and crustaceans and insects\r\nwe find isolated instances of the possession of red blood. Thus the\r\nflat-coiled pond-snail, Planorbis, has bright red blood, so have one\r\nor two bivalve clams, so, too, has an insect larva (known to boys as a\r\nblood-worm) that of the midge (Chironomus), so, too, have some small\r\nfresh-water shrimps, and also a single species of star-fish and one\r\nkind of sea cucumber!\r\n\r\nI explained in the previous chapter that the blood of the vertebrates\r\nmay well be called hæmolymph, since in them the colourless, slightly\r\nopalescent fluid called \"lymph\" is continually poured through certain\r\nopenings into the red blood, and mixed with it. In the earth-worm and\r\nother lower animals the red-coloured blood, or its equivalent--the\r\n\"hæma,\" as distinguished from the \"lymph\"--is held in a closed system\r\nof vessels, and does not receive any of the lymph. When examined with\r\nthe microscope, the blood, or hæmolymph, of man is found to consist\r\nof an albuminous, slightly sticky liquid, in which float an immense\r\nnumber of \"corpuscles\"--minute bodies, some rounded, some irregular,\r\nsome bun-like, and some spherical. The most abundant of these are the\r\n\"red corpuscles,\" of the shape of buns, slightly depressed on each\r\nsurface. Three thousand two hundred of them could be placed lying flat\r\nside by side along the space of a measured inch. They appear pale\r\ngreenish-yellow in colour under the microscope, but in quantity, lying\r\none over the other, they allow only red and some blue light to pass\r\nthrough them, and so have a fine red colour. They consist of a small\r\nquantity of albuminous matter and water, and of a large proportion of\r\na red-coloured, crystallizable, chemical substance dissolved in them,\r\ncalled hæmoglobin, or blood-red. It is this hæmoglobin which performs\r\none of the most important duties of the blood, since it combines\r\nwith the oxygen of the inspired air when the corpuscles are flowing\r\nthrough the fine vessels of the lungs, and carries it to the tissues\r\nin every part of the body, which greedily take the oxygen from the red\r\ncorpuscles.\r\n\r\nThe red corpuscles of man's blood and that of the hairy suckling\r\nanimals--the mammals--are not nucleated cells, but are regularly\r\nformed and renewed as they daily wear out, as fragments of larger\r\nmother-cells, which break up into these corpuscles, in the marrow of\r\nthe bones, and some other situations where they are found. In all\r\nother vertebrates the red blood corpuscles have a kernel, or dense\r\nnucleus, and are complete \"cells,\" usually oval, smooth and flattened\r\nin shape--a curious difference not easily accounted for. There are in\r\na pint of the blood of an average man about two billions of these red\r\ncorpuscles, and the amount of blood in the body is about one-twentieth\r\nof the total weight of the body--say, in a man weighing 160 lb., about\r\n8 lb. or pints of blood. The clear, colourless lymph existing in all\r\nthe lymph spaces of the body is probably about twelve pints. In many\r\nanimals the red corpuscles are much less numerous than in man; for\r\ninstance, a drop of human blood contains a thousand times as many red\r\ncorpuscles as does an equal-sized drop of frog's blood. It is true that\r\nthe frog's red corpuscles are a good deal bigger than those of man, but\r\nthe result is that the human blood is some hundreds of times richer in\r\nhæmoglobin than the frog's, and has a proportionately greater power of\r\ncarrying oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, and keeping up the slow,\r\nburning process, or oxidation, upon which the activity of the body, as\r\nwell as its warmth, depend. The body depends upon its supply of oxygen\r\nas a steam-engine depends upon the oxygen of the air, which keeps its\r\ncoal-fire burning.\r\n\r\nThe pace of the blood-stream which is produced by the force-pump action\r\nof the contractions or beats of the heart is tremendous. It courses\r\nalong at the rate of ten inches in a second in the big arteries and\r\nveins, and it has been carefully ascertained by experiment that a\r\nheartful of blood (which in a big man is about half a pint for each\r\nhalf or \"side\" of the heart)--or let us speak of a single corpuscle--is\r\ndriven out of the heart through the great artery or aorta to the\r\nmost remote parts of the body, and is back again at the heart, after\r\nrunning through endless branches of arteries, smallest capillaries,\r\nand thence into fine veins, bigger veins, and the biggest vein, in\r\ntwenty to thirty seconds, the time occupied by twenty-five to thirty\r\nheart-beats. The walls of the arteries are firm, though elastic, and\r\nit is no wonder, with this tremendous pressure and pace on the liquid\r\nwithin, that when an artery is cut the blood spurts out to a distance\r\nof several feet.\r\n\r\nThe colourless liquid of the blood contains, besides the red corpuscles\r\nfloating in it, others brought to it in the lymph and derived from\r\nvarious connective-tissue spaces and special nodules or \"glands.\" They\r\nare outnumbered by the red corpuscles in the proportion of five hundred\r\nto one. They are colourless, and bigger than the red corpuscles.\r\nMost of them continually change their shape, and consist of active,\r\nmoving protoplasm. These are the \"phagocytes,\" which, besides acting\r\nchemically upon the constituents of the blood-liquid, take into their\r\nsubstance (as does the amœba or proteus-animalcule) and digest and\r\ndestroy all foreign or dead particles, and the bacteria which may\r\nfind their way into it. They pass out, forcing their way through the\r\nexcessively thin walls of the finest capillaries--blood-vessels not\r\nwide enough to admit two of them side by side--and enter, to the\r\nnumber of thousands, the tissues which have been wounded or poisoned\r\nby bacteria, to carry on their all-important protective \"scavenger\" or\r\n\"police-constable\" work.\r\n\r\nInflammation is the slowing of the blood-stream by dilatation of the\r\nvessels at an injured spot, in order to allow the phagocytes to make\r\ntheir way out of the blood-stream into the tissues, and so get to close\r\nquarters with the enemy. There are other excessively minute dustlike\r\nparticles called \"platelets,\" which are sometimes very abundant in\r\nthe liquid of the blood. Besides the duties of oxygen-carrying and\r\nscavengering the blood has other great and vitally important business.\r\nIt has to distribute nutriment, to pick up waste oxidized chemical\r\nproducts and get rid of them, and to distribute and equalize the heat\r\nwhich it carries around the body like a perfect hot-water warming\r\ninstallation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nFISH AND FAST DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nMOST people are familiar with the fact that fasting in the Christian\r\nChurch has from early times been of two degrees--one in which no\r\nflesh of beast or bird or fish, not even eggs, not even milk, may be\r\nconsumed, and a less severe degree in which the eating of fish is\r\nallowed. It is not at first sight clear why the eating of fish--and\r\neven of birds such as the Barnacle goose and the Sooty duck, supposed\r\nto be produced from fish--has been permitted by the Christian Church,\r\nsince the flesh of fish is highly nourishing and an excellent\r\nsubstitute for the meat of beasts and birds, and a man fed upon it\r\nis far from suffering the effects of true \"fasting.\" Many races and\r\nout-of-the-way people live entirely upon vegetables and a little fish,\r\nand do very well on that diet.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved by some learned inquirers that there was a special\r\nsignificance about the permission by the early Christians of a fish\r\ndiet during so-called \"fasting.\" Real and complete fasting, abstention\r\nfrom all food, for a day or even a week, was and still is practised by\r\nsome Eastern peoples as a religious exercise. It is a matter of fact\r\nthat an ecstatic condition of mind is favoured by complete fasting, and\r\nconditions favourable to illusions of various kinds are so produced.\r\nBut the later Christians seem to have regarded the partial fasting\r\nduring Lent and on certain days of the week as a sort of protest\r\nagainst gluttony and excess, and there is no objection to it among\r\nProtestant Churches excepting that it must not be claimed as a merit or\r\nthe equivalent of \"good works.\"\r\n\r\nThat fish were, even in the most ancient times, allowed to be eaten on\r\nfast days is curious. It is suggested by some students of this subject\r\nthat the custom came from Syria, and had to do with certain pagan\r\nceremonials and the worship of the fish-god Dagon. It is supposed that\r\nsome of these early Christians managed, under the guise of a fast of\r\nthe Church, to maintain an ancient pagan custom and religious rite\r\nconnected with the Syrian fish-god. The Jews also eat fish on Friday\r\nevening--though in both cases the origin of the \"fish-eating\" was lost\r\nsight of in the early centuries of the Christian era. On the other\r\nhand, it appears that the worshippers of the fish-god (at any rate, at\r\na remote period) were forbidden to eat fish as being sacred; hence it\r\nseems possible that the permission of a fish diet to Christians during\r\ndays of fasting was given as a means of encouraging those who retained\r\npagan superstitions to ignore and forget them. The supposition that the\r\neating of fish on certain days is a survival of a ceremonial observance\r\nconnected with fish-worship is the more probable explanation of the\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nThe worship of fish or of a fish-god is one of the outcomes of the\r\nold Nature-worship--the cult of Cybele and Rhea, who in the Greek\r\nIslands became the great mother Aphrodite born of the sea, and in\r\nSyria Ashtaroth (Astarte). She appears also as Atargatis, the Syrian\r\nfish-goddess born from a fish's egg, and worshipped at Hierapolis; her\r\nworshippers must not eat fish. Dagon, the fish-god of the Philistines,\r\nbelongs to the same group of mythologic inventions. He was half-fish\r\nand half-human, like a merman, and is, in spite of this strange\r\npersonality identified with the Greek Adonis! The cult of the fish-god\r\nwas widely spread in ancient Greece, even in Byzantine times, and many\r\nChristian converts were devotees of the fish worship. I have on my\r\ntable a photograph of a life-sized fish modelled in gold which was dug\r\nup in 1883 from the shores of a lake near the coasts of the Black Sea.\r\nIt was at one time supposed to be of mediaeval workmanship, but is now\r\nshown to be of ancient Greek workmanship (450 B.C.), and was probably a\r\nvotive offering connected with the worship of the fish-god.\r\n\r\nThen, again, in the ancient Indian story of the Deluge we read of Manu\r\n(who is the Noah of that variety of the ancient legend) finding a\r\nremarkable young fish in a stream where he is bathing. The young fish\r\n(which is really the god Vishnu in disguise) can talk, and requests\r\nManu to take care of it, and promises him if he does so to reveal to\r\nhim when the deluge is coming on. Manu takes the fish home and rears\r\nit. He then is told by the fish to prepare an ark, and place on board\r\nuseful animals and seeds and then to embark on it with his family.\r\nThe ark floats away in the flood, guided by the sagacious fish, which\r\nseizes a rope and, swimming in front of the ark, tows it to a mountain\r\nin Armenia (Ararat!), where the vessel rests whilst the flood goes down.\r\n\r\nThere was evidently a special cult of the fish in Syria and the East,\r\nwhich spread to Greece and Rome in very early pre-Christian times, and\r\nsurvives in some of the stories in the \"Arabian Nights\" about human\r\nbeings being turned into fish. It is not surprising that this cult\r\nshould have lodged itself by obscure means in the practices of the\r\nearly Church.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable outcome of this is the recognition of the fish as\r\nthe symbol of Christ. The letters of the Greek name for fish ΙΧΘΥΣ\r\n(ichthus) can be interpreted as an acrostic, the component letters of\r\nthe word taken in order being the first letters of the words Ἰησοῦς\r\nΧριστὸς Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σώτηρ (Jesous Christos Theou Uios Soter), which\r\nare in English \"Jesus Christ Son of God, Saviour.\" This coincidence\r\nenabled the pagan worshippers of the fish-god to make their symbol or\r\n\"totem\" (using that word in a broad sense) the symbol of the Christian\r\nreligion. Whether the use of the fish and of the letters of the\r\nGreek name for it was or was not independently started by the early\r\nChristians, its employment must have conciliated the fish-worshipping\r\npagans, and rendered it easy to bring them into the fellowship of\r\nthe Christian Church. Hence we see that a fish has more to do with\r\nChristianity than appears at first sight. It is quite possible that\r\nwhilst the cult of the fish-god or fish-goddess may have involved at\r\none period of its growth an abstention from the eating of fish or of\r\nparticular species of fish as being sacred, yet the very ancient belief\r\nin \"contagious magic\" and the acquirement of the qualities of a man or\r\nan animal by eating his flesh, may have in the end prevailed and led to\r\nthe eating of fish, the sacred symbol, on the fast days prescribed by\r\nthe Church, when a special significance would be attached to such food\r\nas was sanctioned.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the connexion of the early Christian Church with fish\r\nworship becomes convincing when once the importance of the great secret\r\ncult of the \"Orpheists\" and its connexion both with early Christianity\r\nand with fish worship is recognized.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that there is a special association of the very\r\nancient and primitive Greek cult of Orpheus, with the much later cult\r\nof Christianity. Many of the most important doctrines and practices\r\nof the widely spread secret society of the Orpheists closely resemble\r\nthose of Christianity. Carvings and medals of Orpheus bringing all\r\nanimals to his feet by his music were, by the earliest Christians,\r\nadopted as equally well representing Christ the Good Shepherd. But\r\nrecent discoveries carry the matter much further. Orpheus is one of\r\nthe names of a mythical hunter and fisherman of prehistoric times, who\r\ntaught his people music, and by his magic helped them to successful\r\ncatches of fish, and to the \"netting\" of beasts, as well as of fish.\r\nHis followers adopted the fish as their \"totem,\" or sacred animal, and\r\nthey represented Orpheus (whether known by that or other names) as\r\nthe warden of the fishes, a fish-god, and himself a fish--\"the great\r\nfish\"--and a \"fisher of men.\" Fishes were kept in his temples and eaten\r\nsolemnly (at first in the raw condition), in order to transmit to his\r\nworshippers his powers.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, where the cult of Orpheus was introduced by way of Thrace,\r\nhe became mixed with, or made a substitute for, Dionysus (the\r\nwine-god), and the same legends were told about the one as the other.\r\nHe and his followers are pictured as wearing a fox's skin (supposed by\r\nsome to have been originally the skin of a sea-fox or shark), and the\r\nfable of the fox and the grapes, and the very ancient story of the fox\r\nfishing with his tail, belong to the Orpheus legends.\r\n\r\nVery ancient peoples, earlier than the Greeks of classical times,\r\nhabitually adopted some animal as their totem and name-god--as do many\r\nsavage races to-day. Thus, the Myrmidones of Thessaly had the ant\r\n(myrmes) as their totem, the Arcadians the bear (arctos), the Pelasgi,\r\nwho preceded the other tribes in Greece--the stork (pelargos). It is\r\nnow suggested that the Hellenes, who succeeded the Pelasgi, and gave\r\ntheir name to Greece (Hellas) and to all its people, were so called\r\nfrom their having the fish (ellos, the mute or silent one, a common\r\nterm applied to fish) as their \"totem,\" and that they were, in fact,\r\nfrom the first worshippers of the fish-god Orpheus, Di-orphos, Dagon or\r\nAdonis! Other \"cults\" grew up among them. The whole Olympian company of\r\ngods and goddesses were fitted out by poets and priests with man-like\r\nforms, and with the speech, habits, and passions of humanity. But the\r\nold deep-rooted worship of the primeval fisherman who was typified by\r\nand identified with \"the great fish\"--much elaborated by its hymns\r\nand mystic ritual, its lore, and its legend--flourished and developed\r\nwonderfully in secret, wherever Greeks were found. Its priests were\r\nmissionaries like the mendicant friars of later days, and it was--in\r\npre-Christian times--the most popular cult not only in Greece and Asia\r\nMinor, but also in Southern Italy. Hence it is easy to understand\r\nthat Christianity, by adopting the fish--the ΙΧΘΥΣ--as its\r\nemblem, readily received sympathy and converts from the Orpheists,\r\nand that the solemn rite of eating the fish on appointed days was\r\nestablished. Hence it seems to have come about that the early Christian\r\nChurch permitted the eating of fish on most (but not on all) fast days.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers have seen the Greek word for \"a fish\" stamped upon\r\nPrayer Books, or possibly a fish embroidered on the hangings of the\r\nchurch where they go to celebrate the birth and the passion of Christ,\r\nas their ancestors have done for a thousand years. And now they will\r\nunderstand the origin of the association of the sacred fish with\r\nChristian ornament, derived from a lingering pagan reverence for the\r\nmysterious silvery inhabitants of deep pools, great rivers, and the\r\nsea. It is to such survivals of the now dim rituals and celebrations\r\nof ancient days that we owe the joyful holly and the mystic mistletoe,\r\nstill happily preserved in our festivities at Christmas and New Year.\r\n\r\nThe use of fish as a regular article of diet is very widely spread.\r\nFresh fish is considered by medical men to be more easily digested\r\nthan the flesh of beasts or birds, and a healthy substitute for the\r\nlatter. Almost everywhere where fish are eaten, the practice of drying,\r\nand often of salting, fish, so as to store them for consumption after\r\nan abundant \"catch,\" has grown up, and with it a great liking for the\r\nflavours produced by the special chemical changes in the fish arising\r\nfrom salting and drying. Ordinary putrefaction produces very powerful\r\npoisons in the flesh of fish. They are known as \"ptomaines,\" and are\r\nproduced in the flesh of fish more readily that in that of other\r\nanimals. But the process of drying in the sun or of salting and smoking\r\nthe fish averts the formation of these poisons. It seems, however, that\r\na diet of dried fish is responsible for a certain kind of poisoning in\r\nman, which renders him liable to the attack of the terrible bacillus\r\nof leprosy. The leprosy bacillus must get into the body by an abrasion\r\nor crack in the skin, through contact with a person already infected.\r\nIt is known that the lack of fresh vegetable and animal food produces\r\nthe ulcerated unhealthy condition called \"scurvy,\" and a \"scorbutic\"\r\nstate of the body seems to be favourable to the establishment in it of\r\nthe leprosy bacillus. The substitution of fresh meat and vegetables\r\nas a diet in place of dried fish and salted meat has apparently been\r\none of the chief causes of the disappearance not only of \"scurvy\"\r\nbut of leprosy from Europe. Leprosy is rapidly becoming extinct in\r\nNorway. It still survives in a few localities, and is common in several\r\nuncivilized communities in remote regions, such as parts of Africa,\r\nIndia, China, and the Pacific Islands. In an earlier chapter, p. 292,\r\nI have referred to the disease known as \"scurvy,\" which has become\r\nso uncommon now as to have escaped thorough investigation by modern\r\npathologists.\r\n\r\nA few marine fish are known which are highly poisonous to any and\r\nevery man, even when cooked and eaten in a perfectly fresh condition,\r\nand there are many individuals who suffer from the \"idiosyncrasy,\" as\r\nit is called, of liability to be dangerously poisoned not only by the\r\npeculiar and rare fish which are poisonous to every one, but by any and\r\nevery fish they may eat, or by two or three common kinds only. Thus,\r\nsome persons are poisoned if they eat lobster or crab, or oysters or\r\nmussels, but can tolerate ordinary fish. Others are poisoned, without\r\nfail, by mackerel and by grey mullet, but not by sole or salmon. The\r\nsymptoms resemble those produced in ordinary persons by the \"ptomaines\"\r\nof putrid fish, and seem to be due to the presence even in fresh fish\r\nof a kind of ptomaine which some persons cannot destroy by digestion,\r\nwhilst most persons can do so. It is literally true that \"What is one\r\nman's meat is another man's poison.\"\r\n\r\nThe use as a \"relish\" of the little fish, the anchovy--allied to\r\nthe sprat and the herring--preserved in salt liquor in a partially\r\ndecomposed state, but not undergoing the ordinary chemical change\r\nexcited by the bacteria of putrescence, is remarkable and very widely\r\nspread. Anchovy sauce is made by mashing up such chemically decomposed\r\nanchovies, and is one of the very greatest and most approved of all\r\nsauces. The anchovy is a Mediterranean fish; it is taken in small\r\nnumbers in sprat-nets in the English Channel and in the Dutch Zuyder\r\nZee. So-called \"Norwegian anchovies\" are not anchovies, but are small\r\nsprats. When taken fresh and cooked and eaten, the anchovy has a very\r\nbitter, unpleasant flavour, which can be washed out of it by splitting\r\nthe fresh fish and letting it lie in salt and water. It was this\r\npractice of washing out the bitterness which led the Mediterranean\r\nfisher-folk to discover that if left for some time in moderately\r\nstrong brine the anchovy develops a wonderfully appetizing flavour,\r\nand becomes dark red in colour, whilst the liquid also becomes red.\r\nI believe that, although it would be easy to do so, it has not been\r\nascertained whether the red colour is due to a direct action of the\r\nsalt upon the blood-pigment of the fish--as is the red colour of salt\r\nbeef--or whether it is due to a special red-colour-making bacterium,\r\nas is the case with salted dried cod, which is sometimes rendered\r\nunsaleable by this red growth. However that may be, the red colour\r\nof the preserved anchovy is well known, and is produced by dealers\r\nby means of artificial pigments, if not already naturally present in\r\nthe salted fish as they come to market. No one would guess on tasting\r\na really fresh bitter anchovy that it could develop the fine flavour\r\nwhich it does when soaked in brine to get rid of its bitterness.\r\n\r\nAnother little fish, the Bummaloh, or \"Bombay duck\" (Harpodon), is\r\ntaken in large quantities off the West Coast of India, and is dried\r\nand used for the peculiar flavour thus developed, which is quite\r\ndifferent from that of the anchovy. It is a deep-water fish, and is\r\nphosphorescent. The liking for the flavours developed in these fishes\r\nby various bacteria when specially treated, is similar to that which\r\nnecessity and custom has developed in our attitude to cheese. Fresh\r\ncheese is difficult to obtain. Habit has ended in our preferring stale,\r\ndecomposed cheese, which has developed a whole series of flavours by\r\nthe action on it of special bacteria and moulds. The Roman soldiers\r\nof the first century used a small salted fish (probably enough the\r\nanchovy) to eat with their rations of bread, and such fish were usually\r\nsold with bread. Probably the small \"fishes\" which, together with a\r\ndozen loaves of bread, are stated to have been used in the miraculous\r\nfeeding of the multitude by Christ, were salted anchovies.\r\n\r\nDealers in Norwegian preserved fish not only falsely call small sprats\r\nby the name \"Anchovy\" in order to sell them, but they have recently\r\nprepared sprats in the manner invented by French fish-curers for the\r\npreparation of the young Pilchard. The French name for young Pilchard\r\nis \"Sardines,\" and their Italian name even in Sir Thomas Browne's time\r\n(1646) was \"Sardinos.\" The natural fine quality of the sardine and\r\nthe skilful \"tinning\" and flavouring of it by the French \"curers\" of\r\nConcarneau in Brittany, have made it celebrated throughout the world as\r\na delicacy. The dealers in Norway sprats--for the purpose of passing\r\noff on the public a cheap, inferior kind of fish as something much\r\nbetter--have recently stolen the French curers' name of \"Sardine,\" and\r\ncoolly call their sprats \"Sardines.\" The sprats thus cured are soft and\r\ninferior in quality to the true sardines, which are a less abundant and\r\ntherefore more costly species of fish. The fraudulent use in this way\r\nof the name \"Sardine\" has been condemned by the law courts in London,\r\nbut the punishment for such fraud is so small and the profit to the\r\nfraudulent dealers is so great that our French friends have to submit\r\nto the iniquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AND THE UNKNOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is a remarkable fact that although the first efforts of the\r\nfounders of the Royal Society for the Promotion of Natural Knowledge,\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years ago, in this country, and of other such\r\nassociations on the Continent, had the immediate effect of destroying\r\na large amount of that fantastic superstition and credulity which had\r\nuntil then prevailed in all classes of society, and although that\r\nperiod marks the transition from the astounding and terrible nightmares\r\nof the Middle Ages to a happier condition when witchcraft, sorcery, and\r\nbaseless imaginings concerning natural things gave place to knowledge\r\nfounded on careful observation and experiment--yet the ugly baleful\r\nrelic of savagery died hard, even in the most civilized communities.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the light that has been shed upon obscure processes,\r\nand all the triumphs of the knowledge of \"the order of Nature,\" there\r\nremains to this day in this country a surprising amount of ignorance,\r\naccompanied by blind unreasoning devotion to traditional beliefs in\r\nmagic, and a love of the preposterous fancies of a barbarous past,\r\nsimply because they are preposterous! \"There is something in it,\" is\r\na favourite phrase, and the words put by Shakespear into the mouth\r\nof the demented Hamlet, who thinks he has seen and conversed with a\r\nghost, \"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are\r\ndreamed of in your philosophy,\" are gravely quoted as though they were\r\napplicable to the Horatios of to-day. We have no reason to suppose that\r\nthere are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our\r\nphilosophy. Those who inappropriately quote this saying as though it\r\nwere proverbial wisdom are usually persons of very small knowledge, and\r\nmistake their own limitations for those of mankind in general.\r\n\r\nThe real and effective answer to all such head-shakings and airs of\r\nmystery is to demand that the reputed marvel shall be brought before\r\nus for examination. The method of the disciples of the founders of the\r\nRoyal Society is not to deny or to assert possibilities. They hold\r\nit to be futile to discuss why such and such a thing should _not_\r\nexist, and still worse to conclude that it does exist, or to hold its\r\nexistence to be probable, because you cannot say why it should not\r\nexist. The real question is, \"Does it exist? Is it so?\" And the only\r\nway of dealing with that question is to have the marvel brought before\r\nyou and subjected to examination and test. \"Nullius in verba!\" The mere\r\nstatement of dozens of witnesses merely gives you as a thing to explain\r\nor account for, not the marvel reported, but the fact that certain\r\npersons say or are reported to say that it does. What you have to\r\nexamine, in the absence of the marvel itself, is, \"How is it that these\r\npeople make this statement?\" You must inquire into the capacities and\r\nopportunities of the witnesses. There are several possible and probable\r\nanswers to that inquiry. For instance, it may be that the witnesses are\r\nmerely inaccurate, or are self-deceived, or deceived by the trickery\r\nor credulity of others, or are insane, or are deliberately stating\r\nwhat is false. Another and often the least probable answer is that the\r\nwitnesses or reporters state what they do because it is the simple\r\ntruth. The statements made have to be accounted for by one or other of\r\nthese hypotheses or suggestions, and each suggestion as to the origin\r\nof the statements must be tested by reference to independent facts in\r\norder to dismiss or to confirm it.\r\n\r\nThe whole of what is called \"modern occultism,\" including spiritualism,\r\nsecond-sight, thought transference (so-called telepathy),\r\ncrystal-gazing, astrology, and such mysteries, can only be treated\r\nreasonably in the way I have mentioned. We ask for a demonstration\r\nof the occurrence of the mysterious communications or prophecies, or\r\n\"raps\" or \"levitations,\" or whatever it may be. Lovers of science have\r\nnever been unwilling to investigate such marvels if fairly and squarely\r\nbrought before them. In the very few cases which have been submitted\r\nin this way to scientific examination, the marvel has been shown to be\r\neither childish fraud or a mere conjurer's trick, or else the facts\r\nadduced in evidence have proved to be entirely insufficient to support\r\nthe conclusion that there is anything unusual at work, or beyond the\r\nexperience of scientific investigators.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunately true that most persons are quite unprepared to\r\nadmit the deficiencies of their own powers of observation and of\r\nmemory, and are also unaware of their own ignorance of perfectly\r\nnatural occurrences which continually lead to self-deception and\r\nillusion. Moreover, the capacity for logical inference and argument\r\nis not common. The whole past and present history of what is called\r\n\"the occult\" is enveloped in an atmosphere of self-deception and of\r\nreadiness to be deceived by others to which misplaced confidence in\r\ntheir own cleverness and power of detecting trickery renders many--one\r\nmay almost say most--people victims. The physician who has given his\r\nlife to the study of mental aberration and diseases of the mind is the\r\nonly really qualified investigator of these \"marvels,\" and no one who\r\nhas closely studied what is known in the domain of mental physiology\r\nand pathology has any difficulty in understanding, and bringing into\r\nrelation with large classes of established facts as to illusions and\r\nmental aberration, the \"beliefs\" in magic and second-sight which are\r\nhere and there found flourishing at the present day, as well as the,\r\nat first sight startling, evidence of highly accomplished men who have\r\nsuffered from such delusions.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside all these more extreme cases of what we may call\r\n\"challenges\" to science, let me cite one or two of the more ordinary\r\nclasses of cases in which science is either attacked or treated with\r\ndisdain by modern wonder-mongers. It was declared by a writer in the\r\neighteenth century that, after all, human knowledge is a very small\r\nthing, since we cannot even tell on one day what the weather is\r\ngoing to be on the next; still less can we control it. That remains\r\nperfectly true to-day, although by the hourly observation and record\r\nof the movements of \"areas of depression\" in the atmosphere and the\r\ntelegraphic communication of these records from all parts of the\r\nAtlantic region of the northern hemisphere to central stations, a very\r\nimportant degree of accuracy in foretelling gales, and even minor\r\nchanges of weather, has been reached. Side by side with this organized\r\nstudy of the movements of \"weather\" we still have the so-called\r\n\"almanacs,\" in which, as in the days of old, certain wizards claim to\r\nforetell the weather of a year, as well as other events. It is less\r\nsurprising that these wizards should find believers when one discovers\r\nthat there are actually well-to-do, \"half-educated\" people in England\r\nwho believe at this day that the delightful clever exhibitors of\r\nmechanical tricks and sleight-of-hand are really (as they usually are\r\ncalled) \"conjurers\"--that is to say, that they conjure spirits and use\r\nthe \"black art.\" Not long ago, having published my experience of the\r\ntrickery of \"dowsers,\" and the illusion known as the \"divining-rod,\" I\r\nreceived a letter in which my correspondent related that, being in the\r\ncoffee-room of an hotel in a country town, he was asked by a man who\r\nwas there to stretch out his hand. He did so, and the man placed four\r\ncoppers in a pile upon it. The man then took up an empty matchbox which\r\nhappened to be on the table, and placed it over the coppers as they lay\r\non my correspondent's hand. After an interval of three or four seconds\r\nthe man lifted the matchbox, and the coppers were gone! This, which I\r\nneed hardly say is one of the most common \"conjuring tricks\" familiar\r\nto every schoolboy, was, according to my correspondent, proof to him\r\nthat the man possessed powers \"not dreamed of in your philosophy,\" and\r\nthat such powers and those of discovery by use of the divining-rod and\r\nsimilar occult arts are possessed by many gifted beings!\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that such credulity is not very common--it is\r\ndifficult to form an estimate as to its prevalence, for it breaks out\r\nin different directions in different individuals. The more impudent\r\nquack remedies for various diseases have had believers amongst all\r\nclasses of society--and occasionally some enthusiast bursts out with\r\nindignation in a letter to the papers, complaining that men of science\r\nor the medical profession neglect their duty to the public and refuse\r\nto examine the wonderful cure. In all these cases the cure is either\r\na drug which is perfectly well known and practically worthless for\r\nthe treatment of the disease for which it is recommended, or--as in\r\nthe case of the celebrated \"blue electricity\" and \"red electricity\"\r\n(nonsensical names in themselves) sold by an Italian swindler as a\r\ncure for cancer and patronized by aristocratic ladies and the late\r\nMr. Stead--is found to be absolutely non-existent. In this last case\r\nthe liquid sold in little bottles at a high price was nothing but\r\nplain water! A more respectable case was the advocacy a few weeks\r\nago by a correspondent in a morning paper of a common African plant\r\n(a kind of basil) as a sure destructive or warder-off of mosquitoes\r\nwhen grown near human habitations, and therefore a protective against\r\nmalaria. Nothing could have been more emphatic than the declaration of\r\nthe value of this plant by its advocate. But a few days afterwards a\r\nletter appeared from a scientific man, giving an account of careful and\r\nvaried experiments, already made and published, which show that this\r\nbasil, although containing in its leaves \"thymol,\" as do some other\r\naromatic herbs, yet neither when grown in quantity nor when crushed and\r\nspread out in a room has any effect whatever in checking the access of\r\nmosquitoes and other flies! In this case, the reputed medical marvel\r\nwas to hand: it was dealt with, tested, and, as they say in the old\r\nregister of the Royal Society, \"was found faulty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nDIVINATION AND PALMISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE gradual passage of the race of man from the condition of \"beasts\r\nthat reason not\" to that of \"persons of understanding and reason\"\r\nhas been an immensely long and a very painful one. It is not yet\r\ncomplete--is far, indeed, from being so--even amongst the most favoured\r\nclasses of the most highly civilized peoples of to-day. Just as our\r\nbodily evolution and adaptation to present conditions is incomplete\r\nand exhibits what Metchnikoff has called \"disharmonies\"--that is,\r\nretentions of ancestral structures now not only useless, but even\r\npositively injurious--so does the mental condition attained by\r\ncivilized man (if we do not limit our observation to exceptional\r\ninstances) exhibit a retention--by means of records and accepted\r\nteaching--of beliefs and tendencies which were among the first\r\nproducts of the blundering efforts of human reason, and have caused\r\natrocious suffering to millions of human beings in the long process\r\nof mental development. At one time the whole race lived in a world of\r\ndelusions and fantastic beliefs--the outcome of false or defective\r\nobservation rather than of false logic. These false conclusions as to\r\nmany subjects were inevitable as soon as man began to reason at all.\r\nIt was the necessary and injurious accompaniment of the growing habit\r\nof \"reasoning\" by which the more fortunate races have eventually been\r\nbrought, step by step, to correct conclusions and a dominant position\r\nat the present day. The progress from the almost universal prevalence\r\nof an enormous system of preposterous false beliefs or conclusions\r\nonward to the triumph of sound knowledge has not only taken an immense\r\nperiod of time, but left whole races of men and large sections of\r\nthe population--even in those races which have produced individuals\r\nremarkable for their power of discovering the truth--still subject\r\nto the early erroneous conceptions of natural processes and of man's\r\nrelation to them.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion certainly seems to be justified that the most advanced\r\nanimal progenitors of mankind, who lived and died unreasoning, the\r\nmere puppets of natural forces which they neither could, nor tried\r\nto, understand and control, were \"happier\" than the \"rebel\" man when\r\nhe first conceived the notion that he could detect cause and effect,\r\nnot only as between a blow and the production of a serviceable flint\r\nimplement, but in the beneficent or injurious relations of the things\r\naround him to one another and to himself. Primitive men seem at a very\r\nremote period to have elaborated in regard to such vital matters a\r\nseries of conclusions--differing in various races according to place\r\nand circumstance--to which they were led by erroneous observation and\r\nimperfect reasoning--reasoning which was arrested and distorted by\r\nfear, desire, haste, and imagination. The word \"magic\" is now used to\r\nindicate those beliefs and conclusions in all their variety, because\r\nthe \"magi\" or priests of Zoroaster (Zarathustra), the founder of the\r\nreligion of the ancient Persians, taught them in an elaborated form,\r\nand practised a system of supposed control of natural forces and of\r\nspirits, good and evil, in connexion with such beliefs. Magic is,\r\ntherefore, defined as the general term for the practice and power of\r\nwonder-working as dependent on the employment of supposed supernatural\r\nor \"occult\" agencies. It forms a vast field of study and one of the\r\ngreatest interest in the attempt to follow out the history of the\r\nworkings of the human mind, its extraordinary envelopment in error and\r\ndelusion, and its gradual emancipation therefrom.\r\n\r\nIn origin \"magic\" and \"religion\" are one. The priest and the magician\r\nwere originally one. Man tried to control Nature by the use of spells\r\nand fantastic procedures, based on imagined powers and correspondences\r\nin natural objects. He excogitated (as a modern child sometimes does)\r\na sort of fancifully assumed system of fixed laws of natural relations\r\nand interactions, of causes and effects which were suggested by\r\nsuperficial likenesses and wild guesses at connexion and sequence,\r\naccepted without criticism. Thus, we have the widespread doctrines\r\nof \"sympathetic magic\" and of \"contagious magic.\" An example of the\r\nfirst is the belief that a certain tree or animal is the sympathetic\r\nrepresentative of a certain man, and that as the one flourishes or\r\nsuffers and dies so will the other. This is extended into a belief that\r\na drawing or image, or even an unshaped stone, may sympathetically\r\nrepresent a man or an animal. The American medicine-man draws the\r\npicture of a deer on a piece of bark, and expects that shooting at\r\nit will cause him to kill a real deer the next day. He mistakes a\r\nconnexion which exists only in the mind of the sorcerer for a real\r\nbond independent of the human mind. Thus, too, waxen or clay images\r\nof an enemy are made and melted before fire or wasted in water, or\r\npierced with pins (even at this day in Scotland, as witness a clay\r\nfigure in the museum at Oxford), in the belief that the enemy himself\r\nwill be similarly injured. The belief in \"contagious magic\" leads\r\nto the procuring of a drop of the blood, or of a piece of the hair,\r\nthe toenails, the clothing, or even a part of the unconsumed food of\r\nanother individual, in order that a sorcerer may, by acting upon it or\r\nrepeating \"incantations\" over it, influence the actions and life of\r\nthat individual for good or for ill.\r\n\r\nBut besides the many forms of these two kinds of magic, there is a\r\nlater variety of magic which grew up with what is not a primitive\r\nbelief, namely, the belief in the existence of spiritual beings\r\ninhabiting trees, rocks, waters, and animals. It developed further with\r\nthe later belief in the existence of ghosts or spirits of the dead.\r\nFear and the desire to control hostile unseen forces was the motive of\r\nall magic. The magician invented \"spells,\" \"rites,\" and \"ceremonies\"\r\nfor controlling and bending these spirits to his will. But as a still\r\nlater development, we find more and more definitely separated from the\r\nmagician and his spells--the priest, who learnt humility in the face\r\nof might greater than his own, and, abandoning the attempt to coerce,\r\nadopted the attitude of propitiation and prayer, and prostrated himself\r\nbefore a higher power. Thus (as Dr. Marret writes) religion gradually\r\nbecame separated from magic, though often mixed with it, and often\r\nretaining magical elements. Religious cults became publicly recognized,\r\nestablished, and respectable, whilst \"magic\" became private, secret,\r\ndisreputable, and at last openly condemned and suppressed by the\r\npriests of religion. The history of magic in Europe, Asia, Africa, and\r\nAmerica presents an almost unlimited field of study. We find remarkable\r\nagreements in the fundamental notions on which magic is based in all\r\nparts of the world and also important differences in details and\r\nspecial developments.\r\n\r\nDivination is that branch of magic which attempts to _discover_\r\nsecrets or to foresee events, whilst magic in general is an attempt\r\nto _influence_ the course of events. Divination is the process of\r\nattempting to obtain knowledge of secret or future things by means\r\nof oracles, omens, or astrology. One of its methods is \"necromancy,\"\r\nthe supposed communication with the spirits of the dead. This word\r\nis formed from the Greek words \"nekros,\" a corpse, and \"manteia,\"\r\ndivination; but in Latin it was erroneously written \"nigromantia,\" and\r\nso gave rise to the application of the name \"the black art\" to sorcery\r\nand witchcraft in general. By the ancient Greeks and Romans all omens,\r\nas well as oracles, were regarded as sent by the gods, and in ancient\r\nRome a large and wealthy corporation of augurs who were constantly\r\nconsulted by private individuals as well as by the State existed.\r\nThey received regular \"fees\" for their services in interpreting and\r\nseeking for omens. The orthodox belief has always been either that the\r\nsoothsayer is directly controlled by a god or a spirit, or, on the\r\nother hand, that the material objects inspected and regarded as signs\r\nof the future are controlled by the gods or by spirits, so as to afford\r\ninformation. Divination is, and has been, practised in all grades of\r\ncivilization and culture, from the Australian \"black fellow\" to the\r\nAmerican medium. Amongst its many varieties are (1) crystal gazing,\r\na method similar to that of dreams, excepting that the vision is set\r\nup voluntarily by gazing into a crystal ball or a basin of water; (2)\r\nshell-hearing; (3) the divining-rod in its various forms; (4) sieve,\r\nring, and Bible swinging; (5) automatic writing; (6) sand divination,\r\nwidely practised in Africa; (7) trance-speaking; (8) the examination\r\nof the hand, or palmistry; (9) card-laying; (10) the interpretation\r\nof dreams; (11) the casting of lots, or sortilege; (12) the drawing\r\nof texts from the Bible or from Virgil (the 'sortes Virgilianæ' of\r\nold times); (13) the inspection of the entrails of animals freshly\r\nkilled (haruspication), and the study of footprints; (14) augury by\r\nomens, such as the behaviour and cry of birds, and the meeting with\r\nominous animals; and lastly (15 and 16), the two highly elaborated and\r\npretentious systems of astrology (divination by the stars) and geomancy\r\n(divination by the lie of hills and rivers). In the case of astrology\r\nthe stars are believed not merely to prognosticate the future, but also\r\nto influence it, and the latter is the special feature of geomancy,\r\npractised in China, where no house or other building can be erected\r\nwithout a certificate as to its favourable position in regard to\r\n\"magic\" by the professional \"geomancer,\" who has to be paid his fee,\r\nand thus takes the place of the local government surveyor and sanitary\r\nofficer of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of these arts of divination there is no doubt\r\nthat, owing to the concentration of his attention on the thing\r\nto be inspected the operator is, in many kinds of divination,\r\n\"self-hypnotized,\" or brought into that well-known mental condition in\r\nwhich the unconscious memory and other special mental processes are\r\nactive, whilst an exaggerated acuteness of the senses is produced.\r\nIn other cases the person who consults the \"operator\" may be so\r\ninfluenced. Hallucination of one kind and another is therefore likely\r\nto occur, and thus mystery and apparently marvellous results are not\r\ninconsistent with the good faith of the operator. But there is no\r\nreason to doubt that the modern sorcerers who make money by their\r\npretended divinations are rogues and impostors of a particularly\r\ndangerous and injurious variety.\r\n\r\nPalmistry or chiromancy is one of the oldest of the large family of\r\nsystems for foretelling the future. It existed in China 4000 years ago,\r\nand is treated in the most ancient Greek writings as a well-known\r\nbelief. The gipsies probably brought it with them from India. Those\r\nwho practise palmistry pretend that by the inspection and proper\r\ninterpretation of the various irregularities and flexion-folds of the\r\nskin of the hand the mental or moral dispositions and powers of an\r\nindividual can be discovered, and not only that, but that the current\r\nof future events in the life of an individual are indicated by them.\r\nTo this it is customary to add nowadays the pretence of a revelation\r\nby these same markings of events in the past life of their owner. It\r\nis only what we might have expected that primitive man, seeking for\r\nsigns and occult mysteries, should have found in the varying folds of\r\nthe hand--\"the organ of organs\"--something to excite his tendency to\r\nattribute magical importance to what he could not simply explain. The\r\nfolds of the skin on the palmar surface of the hand are, as a matter\r\nof fact, so disposed that the thick loose skin shall be capable of\r\nbending in grasping, whilst it is held down to the skeleton of the\r\nhand by fibrous lines of attachment, so as to prevent its slipping and\r\nthe consequent insecurity of grip. The swellings bounded by the lines\r\nof folding and fixture are called \"monticuli\" by the palmist, and are\r\nsimply subcutaneous fat, which acts as a padding, or cushioning, and\r\nprojects between the lines of fibrous attachment of the skin to the\r\ndeeply placed bones. They differ slightly in different individuals, as\r\ndo other structures.\r\n\r\nThese same lines and monticuli are present in the hands and feet of the\r\nchimpanzee and other man-like apes, and were specially exhibited under\r\nmy direction in the upper gallery of the Natural History Museum. But\r\nno palmist ever read the ape's hand, although, according to the great\r\nand authoritative treatises on palmistry, it would be perfectly easy\r\nto do so, since every variation in the lines and the monticules has\r\nbeen mechanically dealt with, and its supposed indications precisely\r\ndetermined by a formal set of rules. There are similar lines on\r\nthat part of the foot in human infants and in the adult apes which\r\ncorresponds to the palmar surface. But no palmist has attempted to deal\r\nwith them. The fact is that the attributions indicated by such names as\r\nthe line of heart, the line of life, the line of the head, and the line\r\nof fortune are purely arbitrary, as are those of the monticules Venus,\r\nJupiter, Saturn, the Sun, Mercury, Mars, and the Moon. In past times\r\nthere have been great divergences in their interpretation by different\r\nschools, and the present uniformity is as devoid of any conceivable\r\nrelation to fact as were the former divergences. It is impossible to\r\ndiscuss the asserted correlation of the lines and monticules of the\r\nhand with either character or life-history, since no facts are offered\r\nin support of the notion that there is such a correlation. We have bare\r\nassertion, and nothing more, as in most of the other doctrines of magic.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the hand and of the fingers, and the softness, hardness,\r\ndryness, and moisture of the skin are taken into account by most\r\npalmists. Few, if any, of those who pretend at the present day to\r\n\"read\" a hand are really acquainted with the elaborate rules laid down\r\nby the painstaking, if deluded, people who endeavoured to construct a\r\nsort of astrology of the hand by assigning the names of heavenly bodies\r\nto parts of it. The modern professional palmist forms a judgment and\r\nguess as to his or her client's character and probable past and future\r\nhistory by indications and information obtained from the client's face,\r\nmanner, conversation, costume, and personal acquaintance. If a vague\r\nprophecy made by the \"fortune-teller\" should by hazard turn out to be\r\nnear the truth, it is remembered and quoted by the client as a proof\r\nof the truth of palmistry; if it does not prove to be correct, it is\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nThe question of the possibility of judging of the character and\r\ndisposition of a man or woman by the form and proportions of the\r\nhand or the foot is altogether distinct from that of the reality of\r\n\"divination\" of future events by applying a system of rules to the\r\ninterpretation of the lines and swellings of the palmar surface.\r\nPersons of quick perception are in the habit of forming judgments as to\r\ncharacter from a first impression of the face, expression, voice, and\r\nmovements of another individual. Often such judgments are erroneous,\r\nand I do not know that they have ever been proved by a large series of\r\nexperiments to be more frequently right than wrong. But it is possible\r\nthat correct indications may sometimes be thus obtained. Many people\r\nthink that they can form more or less correct judgments as to certain\r\nmental characteristics by observing the shape and play of the hand and\r\nfingers or of the foot. There may be such a correlation of the gesture\r\nand form of hands or feet with some mental qualities, but obviously\r\nthis has nothing to do with palmistry. It has never been really proved\r\nthat persons of what is called \"good birth\" have smaller hands and feet\r\nthan persons of \"low birth,\" although it is often assumed that they\r\nhave. And it has never been shown why small hands and feet should go\r\nwith \"good birth,\" supposing that they do so, or why some people have\r\nlarge and some small extremities. The possible effect of certain manual\r\noccupations in enlarging the hands of an individual is, of course,\r\nexcluded; the question raised is as to naturally or hereditarily small\r\nhands and feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTOADS FOUND LIVING IN STONE\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is quite true that one should not refuse to entertain the\r\npossibility of something almost incredible taking place, simply because\r\nit is highly improbable that it has taken place. Also it is important\r\nthat one should not accept and believe in the reality of the marvellous\r\noccurrence, merely because a decent sort of person has asserted that he\r\nhas witnessed it and is satisfied of its reality. In a previous chapter\r\n(p. 117) we have seen how the story of the Tree goose and the hatching\r\nof geese from Barnacles was supported by respectable but incompetent\r\nwitnesses such as Gerard, the herbalist, and Sir Robert Moray, the\r\nfirst president of the Royal Society. There are many equally baseless\r\nfancies which are attested by \"respectable\" witnesses at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe statement that workmen splitting large blocks of stone in the\r\nquarries have seen a toad hop out of a cavity in the interior of\r\nthe stone attracted a good deal of attention in the earlier half of\r\nlast century. I do not know whether it can be traced to any great\r\nantiquity. I see no reason to doubt the truth of the statement in\r\nits simple form as given above. It has, I have no doubt, repeatedly\r\nhappened--as letters to newspapers and in earlier days serious\r\npamphlets record--that on splitting a block of stone the workmen\r\nengaged in the operation have seen a toad emerge from the broken mass.\r\nThe fact is that the rocks in many stone quarries are \"fissured\" or\r\ncracked, so that a narrow space or \"crack\" extends through many feet\r\nof thickness of rock to the surface, which is covered by vegetable\r\nmould. Occasionally, owing to rain and flood, the mould is washed\r\naway, and some of it carried into the cracks or fissures in the rock.\r\nOccasionally a young toad is carried from the surface into such a\r\nfissure and far down its sides, and eventually lodges 20 feet or\r\nmore in the thickness of the rock. The same circumstances which have\r\ncarried the toad into the fissure carry in also from time to time small\r\nworms, grubs, insects, on which the toad may feed, but in any case\r\nthe far-spreading though narrow fissure will hold plenty of air and\r\nmoisture, and even without food a toad can remain alive for several\r\nmonths provided that the temperature is about that of a cool autumn\r\nday, its surface kept moist and the air also. Hence it is in accordance\r\nwith recognized conditions that occasionally quarrymen should \"get\r\nout\" a block of stone deep below the surface in a stone quarry which\r\nis traversed by a fissure or has a small natural cavity in it (as\r\nlimestone and other rocks often have) communicating with a fissure, and\r\nthat when they break the stone and accidentally open the fissure or\r\nconnected cavity a healthy living toad is found ensconced in it. The\r\nrecent washing of clay and powdered stone into the fissure by rain and\r\nflood sometimes may hide its existence from the casual observation of\r\nthe workmen, and the soft material washed in may even be found fitting\r\nclosely to the toad's body. And thus it will appear that the toad is\r\nvery closely embedded in the solid stone.\r\n\r\nProbably no one would have cared very much a couple of hundred\r\nyears ago if toads were constantly present in the centre of solid\r\nstones. Toads were regarded as queer, dangerous things connected with\r\nwitchcraft, and there was no accounting for their behaviour. The view\r\ntaken by the well-to-do class would have been in those days (as perhaps\r\nit would be less generally to-day) similar to that of the Chicago\r\nmillionaire when shown, by means of the spectroscopic examination of\r\nlight, the proof of the existence of the metal sodium in the sun.\r\nThe professor who took the millionaire round his laboratory wished\r\nto interest him in the discoveries of science, and hoped that he\r\nmight contribute to the funds necessary to pay for the elaborate and\r\ndelicate instruments by which such discoveries are made. He showed many\r\nremarkable experiments to his visitor, and wound up by showing him\r\nthe two narrow lines of yellow light caused by incandescent sodium.\r\nHe showed him how exactly their position in the spectrum could be\r\nfixed and measured; how they caused two black lines in the spectrum\r\nof light, which was made to traverse a flame in which incandescent\r\nsodium was present. And then he showed him that in the spectrum of the\r\nsun's light there were two black lines (besides thousands of others)\r\nwhich exactly coincide with the two sodium lines; whilst others of the\r\nblack lines in the solar spectrum coincide with bright lines given\r\nout by incandescent hydrogen, iron, magnesium, etc. The millionaire\r\nfollowed it all and understood the completeness of the demonstration.\r\nThe professor was delighted and hopeful. Then the millionaire said,\r\n\"Who the hell cares if there is sodium in the sun?\" I was not told by\r\nthe disappointed professor (it was Professor Michelson, and he related\r\nthis little episode at a dinner of the Royal Society) what reply he\r\nmade to this inquiry or whether he was eventually successful in his\r\nattempt to secure funds from the millionaire. The attitude which the\r\nmillionaire took towards scientific discovery is not a natural one, but\r\nthe result of the stifling of natural interest and curiosity by long\r\nconcentration on the art and practice of money-making. So, too--owing\r\nto other mental pre-occupations and concentrations--though a boy or a\r\nsavage might have been puzzled and deeply interested in the occurrence\r\nof a live toad in the middle of an apparently solid piece of rock, the\r\n\"country gentleman\" of the eighteenth century would have said, if the\r\nmatter had been pressed on his attention, \"Who the hell cares if there\r\nare live toads in the rocks?\" And a large but decreasing number of his\r\nrepresentatives to-day would make the same remark.\r\n\r\nIt, however, happened that at the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\na spirit of inquiry into the history of the crust of our earth was set\r\ngoing. The science of geology was eagerly pursued by many capable men,\r\nboth abroad and in this country. The Geological Society of London was\r\nfounded in 1809. The doctrine of the vast age of the earth and the\r\ndemonstration of successive layers of deposit--forming its rocks and\r\ncontaining the remains of strange and of gigantic animals unlike those\r\nnow existing--excited widespread interest and controversy. Buckland\r\nintroduced the study of geology in Oxford. Lyell was his pupil, and\r\nbecame the great teacher and exponent of geological theory in a series\r\nof masterly treatises, written in such form that they appealed during\r\nhalf a century to educated men of all professions and occupations. The\r\ncountry clergy and their friends gave themselves with enthusiasm to the\r\ninvestigation of strata and the collection of fossils. Now came the\r\nopportunity of the toad embedded in stone!\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while inquiring who was the first to make the\r\nsuggestion, but it very soon became one of the favourite assertions\r\nof the wonder-mongers who hang on to the skirts of science--not to\r\nbe confused with the enthusiastic nature-lover--that the living\r\ntoads found in blocks of stone, and sometimes in lumps of coal, are\r\nthousands of years old, contemporary with the geologic age of the rocks\r\nin which they are found embedded, survivors of the extinct animals\r\nwhose bones and teeth the geologists had discovered and described,\r\nalso embedded in such rocks! This entirely baseless fancy took root,\r\nand has flourished ever since the early Victorian period. Only a few\r\nmonths ago there were paragraphs in the papers on the discovery of a\r\nlive toad of antediluvian age in a block of stone. Old gentlemen have\r\nrepeatedly written to the newspapers, and sometimes privately to me,\r\ndescribing how they had, on breaking an unusually large lump of coal\r\nin the dining-room coal-scuttle, liberated from an age-long prison\r\nan antediluvian toad, which hopped out from the lump of coal in a\r\nmarvellous state of health and agility. Whenever any discussion has\r\narisen with regard to these statements, and such an explanation offered\r\nas I have given above as to the apparent enclosure of a toad in a piece\r\nof rock, or a similar explanation as to the encasement of one in the\r\nblack mud adhering to lumps of coal stacked in sheds or cellars--some\r\nof the would-be believers in the immense age of the liberated toads\r\nappeal to the fact that amongst the most remarkable extinct animals\r\nwhose bodies are found in ancient strata are reptiles, whilst others,\r\nmore learned, insist on the well-known prevalence of the remains of\r\nanimals of the class Amphibia, to which the toad belongs, in the \"Coal\r\nMeasures.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer to these rash believers in what they call \"the evidence\r\nof their own senses\" and the disentombment of living specimens of the\r\nancient world from lumps of stone or of coal--apart from that given\r\nby the fact that there is complete absence of any proof that the toad\r\nbefore liberation was really and truly encased in a stony chamber to\r\nwhich it could not, by any possibility, have recently gained access--is\r\nthat the common toad, which is thus discovered and supposed to be a\r\nsurvivor of long past geologic ages, is a modern production of Nature's\r\ngreat breeding establishment. It is quite easy to distinguish it from\r\nall other living species of toads; it is spread over a limited area,\r\nexisting in the north temperate region of our hemisphere in many parts\r\nof which it is replaced by other similar but distinct species. If we\r\nask what is known of it in past ages as revealed by the Pliocene,\r\nMiocene, and Eocene strata, we find that it did not exist at all in\r\nthe latest of these, but was represented by ancestors like it, yet\r\nmarkedly different. Remains of a kind of toad are found in the Upper\r\nEocene \"phosphorite\" of the South of France, and in 1903 such remains\r\nwere found in an oolitic deposit. As we descend further the series of\r\ngeologic strata, the remains of toads and frogs cease to occur. In the\r\ncoal measures they were represented by ancestors provided with tails\r\nlike the newts and salamanders of our own day. They had not come into\r\nexistence, nor, probably, had any creature closely resembling them, at\r\nthat period. In the \"Coal Measures\" we find abundant remains of very\r\nlarge and also of small animals related to salamanders, newts, and\r\nless closely to toads, but they are in great and important features of\r\nstructure unlike the Amphibia and Batrachia of to-day. Hence the notion\r\nwhich lay at the bottom of the excitement caused by the discovery of\r\nlive toads in the interior of rocks or of coal--namely, that the\r\ncreature was a survivor from the lost world of extinct \"antediluvian\"\r\nanimals--falls to the ground. It has no better claim to attention than\r\nthe similar but perhaps bolder statement indulged in from time to time\r\nby an inventive transatlantic Press, namely, that \"some workmen on\r\nblasting a rock in the quarries at Barnumsville were astonished by the\r\nescape from a cavity within the solid rock of a large flying lizard or\r\npterodactyle, which immediately spread its wings and flew out of sight.\"\r\n\r\nConnected with these fancies is the theory that the traditional\r\ndragon of heraldry and of the Chinese is a memory handed down to the\r\npresent day from immensely remote times, when--so we are asked to\r\nbelieve--man co-existed with the great extinct dragon-like creatures\r\nknown as pterodactyles (see \"Science from an Easy Chair,\" First Series;\r\nMethuen, 1910). As a matter of fact the heraldic dragon does not\r\nclosely resemble the pterodactyle or other extinct reptiles, and is an\r\nimaginative creation of human artists based upon the realities of the\r\ngreat pythons of India and the little parachute lizard (8 inches long)\r\nof the same region, known to zoologists as Draco volans. The close\r\nagreement of this little lizard with European heraldic representations\r\nof the dragon is conclusive as to the origin of the details of form\r\nand appearance assigned to that legendary beast, though the great\r\nsize ascribed to it and the terror associated with it is traceable to\r\nthe great snakes of the Far East--\"drako\" being the Greek word for a\r\nserpent. And further, there is very good ground for concluding that a\r\nlong interval of geologic ages separates the disappearance of the great\r\nextinct reptiles and the pterodactyles from the appearance, on this\r\nglobe, of the earliest man-like apes, and no reason to suppose that the\r\nlatter could have handed on any knowledge of such extinct reptiles to\r\ntheir descendants, even had they seen such creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE DIVINING-ROD\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE divining-rod, spoken of by the Romans as \"virgula divina,\" and\r\nmentioned by Cicero and by Tacitus, was a different thing altogether\r\nfrom the modern forked twig of the water-finder, and seems to be of\r\nimmemorial antiquity. Its use in \"divination\" was similar to that\r\npractised with a ring or a sieve suspended by a string. When the rod\r\nis thrown into the air and falls to the ground, or when the suspended\r\nobject is set moving, it eventually comes to rest, and when thus at\r\nrest must point in one particular direction. It was supposed that gods\r\nor spirits invoked at the moment guided the movement and final position\r\nof rest, so as to make the divining-rod or ring or sieve point to\r\nburied treasure, to an undetected murderer, or to a witch or wizard who\r\nhad used magic arts to injure the person seeking its aid. Bits of stick\r\nare so used at the present day by some savage races. The notion leading\r\nto its use is the same as that which has led to augury by inspection of\r\nan animal's entrails, by the flight of birds, and other such varying\r\nappearances. The notion is that an unseen protective power will, when\r\nproperly invoked, interfere with the blindly varying thing and make it\r\nvary so as to give indications either of hidden objects or of future\r\nevents. The unseen power which thus revealed itself was primitively\r\nsupposed to be that of a god or a spirit, but later the augur or\r\nintermediary who worked the \"show\" acquired exclusive importance and\r\narrogated to himself mysterious powers. The same transference of\r\nimportance has come about in the case of the modern hazel-twig and the\r\n\"douser,\" who now claims to \"divine\" without its aid.\r\n\r\nThe tossing of a halfpenny to decide as to alternative courses of\r\naction, still almost universally prevalent in this country, is in\r\norigin (and largely in actual practice) an appeal to supernatural\r\npowers to give an indication by interference with the natural fall of\r\nthe coin, as to which of the alternative courses is the more favourable\r\nto the interests of the individual who tosses the coin or agrees to\r\nfollow its decision if tossed by someone else. \"Heads I go; tails I\r\nstay where I am.\" Of a like nature is the drawing of lots, and so\r\nare a number of similar practices originally devised for the purpose\r\nof obtaining guidance from supernatural sources. Some of them have\r\nsurvived without any associated superstition, and are commonly used\r\nat the present day merely in order to obtain an impersonal decision\r\nas to which of two or more claimants is to enjoy a certain privilege\r\nor exemption, as, for instance, when a coin is tossed to decide as to\r\nwhich side of the river at the start shall be occupied by competitors\r\nin a boat race, or which shall have choice of innings in a cricket\r\nmatch, or as when lots are drawn to determine who shall enjoy exemption\r\nfrom military service. But even in these cases there are large numbers\r\nof men and women who believe that some mysterious power which could\r\npossibly be won over to their side, or else what they call \"a special\r\nprovidence,\" determines the issue. There are, I need hardly say, no\r\nfacts which justify the belief in any such interruption of the orderly\r\ncourse of nature.\r\n\r\nThe forked twig (virgula furcata of the alchemists) used by\r\nwater-finders has another significance and history. The forked twig is\r\nheld, one branch in one hand and the other branch in the other hand,\r\nby the explorer. After a time, as the explorer walks along, the twig\r\nsuddenly, and even vigorously, \"plunges\" or \"ducks\" as he holds it.\r\nIt seems to do so \"of its own accord.\" The old English word \"douse\"\r\nsignifies ducking, dipping, or plunging. The forked twig \"douses.\"\r\nHence the persons who use it are called \"dousers.\" The belief is\r\nwidespread that this dousing or plunging of the forked twig is caused\r\nby the presence of a vein of metallic ore in the ground, or in other\r\ncases by the presence of subterranean water. It is interesting to\r\nascertain what grounds there are for this belief.\r\n\r\nThe dousing-rod or twig is first mentioned in the fifteenth century\r\nby a writer on alchemy (Basil Valentine), and in 1546 by Agricola\r\n(De re metallica), who says it must be either of willow or hazel,\r\nand describes its use in the discovery of metalliferous veins and\r\nsubterranean water. The purely fantastic belief on which its use was\r\nbased was part of the doctrine of \"sympathies.\" It was supposed that\r\nthe branches of certain plants were drawn to certain \"sympathetic\"\r\nmetals in the earth beneath them--a supposition suggested by the\r\ndownward growth or \"weeping\" of the branches of trees and bushes in\r\nsome cases. By the Germans the forked twig used in searching for\r\nmetals or water was called \"Schlagruthe,\" which has the same meaning\r\nas \"dousing\" or \"plunging\" or \"striking rod.\" It was introduced into\r\nEngland by German miners who were employed in the time of Queen\r\nElizabeth by merchant venturers in working the Cornish mines--and it\r\nhas remained with us ever since--though one hears little at the present\r\nday of its use in searching for metalliferous deposits, and more about\r\nthe supposed wonderful results obtained with its aid by professional\r\nwater-finders.\r\n\r\nWe have to distinguish the facts established in regard to \"the\r\ndousing-twig\" from the inferences and suppositions based upon those\r\nfacts by credulous people. There is no room for doubt that when the\r\nforked twig, in shape like a letter =Y= upside down, is held by a\r\nmore or less nervous but perfectly honest person who takes the matter\r\nvery seriously, and holds firmly one branch of the fork in one hand\r\nand the other in the other hand, the fingers well round it so as to\r\nbring it against the palm of the hand, a strange thing happens after\r\nsome minutes. The twig seems to the person holding it to give a sudden\r\nmovement as though drawn downwards. If he or she is walking along,\r\nintently awaiting this movement, and believing that it will be caused\r\nby some subterranean attraction, the effect is, naturally enough,\r\nstartling. It occurs more readily with some persons than with others.\r\nWhat is the explanation of it? There is no necessity for supposing that\r\nit is due to any mysterious attraction by hidden water or metal. It has\r\nbeen clearly shown that it is due to fatigue of the muscles which are\r\nemployed in keeping the hands and fingers in position. The muscles in\r\nuse suddenly relax, and the hands turn to a new pose--one of rest--and\r\nwith them the forked twig. In most persons attention and control are\r\nsufficiently active to prevent this sudden relaxation of the muscles.\r\nBut those who are liable to mental absorption in the strange procedure,\r\nand are apt to become half-dazed by the solemn sort of \"rite\" in which\r\nthey are engaged, find their tired hands (tired, though they are\r\nunconscious of it) suddenly turning, and the twig \"ducking\" downwards\r\nin a way which they can neither explain nor control. Such persons\r\nare the honest, self-deceived \"dousers,\" who are, and have been,\r\nsufficiently numerous to establish a belief in the existence of a\r\nmysterious agency causing the twig to \"duck.\" No doubt originally, with\r\ncomplete innocence and honesty, this mysterious agency was believed to\r\nbe a sort of magnetic attraction due to a sympathy between the twig\r\nand subterranean metal. In later days, without any attempt to give a\r\nreason for the change, the same class of people have believed that it\r\nwas water far below the surface of the earth which was the cause of the\r\nattraction, and consequent ducking or dousing of the twig.\r\n\r\nLet us assume for a moment that the facts are as I have stated, and\r\nthat the honest \"douser\" merely finds his forked twig dousing or\r\nducking because his hands are tired by keeping in one position. Then\r\nit is evident that no harm would be done, but rather a useful decision\r\nleading to action would be determined, by the belief that concealed\r\nmetal was the cause of the \"ducking.\" Digging must be commenced\r\nsomewhere, and the dousing-rod would only be tried on likely ground,\r\nso that, often, the thing sought for (whether metal or water) would\r\nbe found after prolonged excavation at the spot indicated by the\r\ndouser, or near it. If the digging were a failure, the believers in\r\nthe dousing-rod would say that they had not been able to dig deep\r\nenough, or that some hostile agency had intervened and misled the\r\n\"douser,\" or that he was in poor health, and so \"worked\" badly. The\r\nsuccesses are remembered and the failures forgotten. So the belief in\r\nthe dousing-twig as a real guide to subterranean metal and water has\r\nbeen maintained, and all the more securely because there have been, and\r\ndoubtless are still, many honest, innocent country people who truly\r\nbelieve that they possess an exceptional and mysterious gift in being\r\nable to experience the curious ducking action of the twig when they\r\nwalk with it in their hands in quest of this or that.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century the dousing-twig was used as a guide in all\r\nsorts of quests, for instance, in searching for hidden treasure and\r\nin tracking criminals! In our own times it is chiefly known through\r\nits use by professional water-finders. There is no doubt that some of\r\nthese gentry are dishonest. They are not the credulous rustics to whom\r\nthe dousing-twig owes its long popularity. They are often clever and\r\nexpert judges of the indications by form of the land, lie of geological\r\nstrata, and distribution of vegetation, as to the subterranean water\r\nwhich is so abundant in this country. They make a pretence of using the\r\ndouser's twig, in order to obtain employment from landowners in search\r\nof a likely spot for sinking a well, since it is the fact that many\r\npeople prefer to be guided by a sort of magician who uses a supposed\r\nmysterious occult agency rather than to employ the honest and perhaps\r\nless acute geologist who avowedly proceeds in his search for water by\r\nmaking use of ascertained facts as to the structure and character of\r\nthe subsoil and deeper strata of the district in which his services are\r\ncalled for.\r\n\r\nThe believers in the connexion of the movement of the douser's rod and\r\nthe existence of concealed metal or water, have of late years started\r\nthe theory that the twig itself is of no value in the \"experiment.\"\r\nCertain dousers have declared that they can work just as well without\r\nit, and that it is not the rod or twig but they themselves who are\r\nsensitive to concealed water or metal. They state that they feel a\r\npeculiar \"sinking\" in the pit of the stomach, also a nervous tremor,\r\nand that their hands move spasmodically, causing the rod to move, and\r\nthey attribute this to an influence on the human body of \"vibrations\"\r\nor possibly \"electricity\" from the concealed metal or water. This is\r\ningenious enough; it shifts the seat of mysterious action from the\r\nsimple twig to the much more complex human body, and accepts to a\r\ncertain extent what I have above stated as to the nervous condition of\r\nthe douser and the fatigue of the hands.\r\n\r\nOthers, who have lately discussed the subject, suggest that the douser\r\nis affected not by any known kind of physical vibrations, but by\r\nsome mysterious emanation from the concealed metals or water similar\r\nto that which they (without any sufficient evidence) assume to pass\r\nfrom one human being to another over long distances, causing what has\r\nbeen called \"second-sight,\" \"thought-reading,\" and (in order to give\r\nan air of scientific importance to it) \"telepathy.\" This may seem\r\nsatisfactory to some people, but it is plainly a case of attempting\r\nto explain a little-known thing by reference to a still less known\r\nthing--what is called \"ignotum per ignotius.\" Sir W. F. Barrett, of\r\nDublin, has lately written on this subject, and very rightly says that\r\nthe real question to be decided in the first instance is whether the\r\nmodern \"water-finders,\" who profess to be guided by occult influences,\r\nwhatever the nature of those influences may be, are more successful in\r\ndiscovering water than those who seek for it by the use of the known\r\nnatural indications of its presence; and, further,--and this seems\r\nto me to be the most important consideration,--whether, taking into\r\naccount all the \"experiments\" made by the occultist water-finders,\r\nboth the successful and the unsuccessful, the proportion of successes\r\nis greater than might be expected as a matter of chance and the use of\r\ncommon intelligence.\r\n\r\nThat is, in fact, the interesting point about the persistent belief\r\nin the \"magical\" powers of water-finders. It is one of several more\r\nor less traditional beliefs which depend on coincidence. The belief\r\nin birth-marks is of this nature. A lizard drops from the ceiling\r\nof her room on to a woman. A few weeks afterwards she bears a child\r\nwhich has a mark upon its breast more or less \"resembling\" a lizard.\r\nSome people believe that the mark on the child is caused by what is\r\ncalled \"a maternal impression,\" the influence on the mother's mind\r\nof the scare caused by the lizard being expressed in the mark on the\r\nchild's body. To form a conclusion as to the truth of this explanation\r\nwe require to know what proportion of mothers in a given population\r\nhave been startled by lizards, what proportion of children are born\r\nwith marks on them more or less \"resembling\" a lizard (there is much\r\nsignificance in the \"more or less\"), and whether there are more\r\nchildren born with a lizard-like mark on the body from mothers who have\r\nbeen frightened shortly before the child's birth by a lizard, than from\r\nmothers who have not been thus frightened. The inquiry is not an easy\r\none. The same question of coincidence applies to water-finding. Taking\r\nseveral thousand attempts to find water we must ask, \"Is the attempt\r\nunsuccessful in a larger percentage of trials in the case of those who\r\ndo not follow the indications of a dousing-rod than in the case of\r\nthose who make use of it?\" Sir W. F. Barrett admits the difficulty of\r\ngetting at satisfactory statistics in the matter; but is inclined to\r\nthink the dousers are the more successful, and so entertains a theory\r\nof mysterious agency to account for their success. My own impression is\r\nthat in difficult cases of search for water dousers are as frequently\r\nunsuccessful as non-dousers.\r\n\r\nIt is true we cannot get proper returns of all cases of success\r\nand failure. But in this matter of \"water-finding\" we can make\r\nuse of \"experiment,\" a thing which is not so easy in regard to\r\nbirth-marks--though it is related that the patriarch Jacob made an\r\nexperiment of this character with his pealed stakes. Experiments have\r\nlately been made with dousers or water-diviners to test their powers.\r\nThese experiments have been carried out both in Paris and in the South\r\nof England. They are unfavourable to the pretensions of the diviners.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to perform under perfectly fair conditions a\r\nnumber of experiments sufficiently large to enable us to arrive at a\r\ndemonstration of the truth in this matter. Some thousand \"dousers\"\r\nshould be put to the test under proper conditions and guarantees, and\r\nthe percentage of failures and successes carefully recorded. This has\r\nnot been done, although \"dousers\" have often been tested and found to\r\nbe unable to discover subterranean water known to be present, or else\r\nhave given erroneous indications. If you prove some one individual\r\n\"douser\" to be an impostor, or else self-deluded--the reply by those\r\nwho believe in the existence of the occult power attributed to dousers\r\nis, naturally enough, that though this individual was an impostor, or\r\nincapable, yet that does not prove that all other individuals who claim\r\nto possess certain peculiar powers in the discovery of water are so.\r\nAll that can be done is to challenge any douser to come forward and\r\nestablish, in the presence of a competent tribunal of experts, that\r\nhe can indicate in a given area the whereabouts of subterranean water\r\nalready known to the committee but not possibly known beforehand to the\r\ndouser.\r\n\r\nThis experiment was made a year or two ago near Guildford by a\r\ncommittee of water engineers and geologists, and also by a similar\r\ncommittee in Paris. Only a dozen or two of the water-finding dousers\r\ncame forward and submitted to be thus tested, and they entirely\r\nfailed to show any special capacity for discovering water. They\r\nfailed signally. But then the believers may, of course, retort that\r\nthe really gifted superior dousers had refused to have anything to\r\ndo with the inquiry, and that \"their withers are unwrung.\" The same\r\nkind of test was some years ago made with the so-called \"spiritualist\r\nmediums.\" A banknote for £1000 was placed in a very carefully sealed\r\nenvelope, and deposited in a safe in a bank. Its owner advertised his\r\noffer to present the note to any spiritualists who would correctly\r\nstate the number of the note. The offer remained open for some years,\r\nbut the spiritualists were unable to gain information about this very\r\nsimple matter by their methods of consulting supposed \"spirits,\" and\r\nthe note was never claimed. Of course, some of those who believe in\r\nspiritualism, maintain that the genuine \"mediums,\" for some reason not\r\naltogether clear, refused to make the attempt to discover the number.\r\nOthers put forward the view that the \"spirits\" took offence at the\r\nproposed test, and refused to reveal the number. Others, again, took\r\nthe line that this was just one of the few things about which \"spirits\"\r\nare unable to communicate with mortals, or are forbidden by superior\r\norder to reveal.\r\n\r\nIt is accordingly fairly obvious that it is not of much use to take\r\nthe trouble to expose the falsity of the pretensions of any isolated\r\nspecimen of a douser or of a spirit medium. However that may be, some\r\nyears ago, when I was staying in an ancient castle in the North of\r\nEngland, my hostess procured the attendance of a youth who had a great\r\nreputation as a douser, in order that I might test his pretensions.\r\nThe youth arrived with his father, and had half a dozen =Y=-shaped\r\nhazel twigs ready for use. The party staying in the castle met him on\r\nthe terrace, a broad gravel walk which surrounded the battlements. I\r\nasked him to walk round the castle and mark in our presence the spots\r\nat which his twig indicated the presence of subterranean water. The\r\ncircuit was somewhat less than a quarter of a mile, and he indicated\r\neleven spots. We placed obvious marks at each of these spots. I\r\nthen took him into the castle and, aided by a friend, carefully\r\nblindfolded him with pads of cotton-wool over each orbit and a large\r\nsilk handkerchief. We then led him out by a circuitous route on to\r\nthe terrace and asked him to try again to indicate the spots which he\r\nhad just discovered. He walked along as before and stopped at several\r\nspots, saying that his twig indicated water where he stood. He also\r\nmade futile efforts by turning and throwing back his head, to catch\r\na glimpse of some of the marks we had placed at the spots previously\r\nindicated by him. But the pads of cotton-wool effectually prevented\r\nhim from seeing anything. In no case (as a large party of onlookers\r\ntestified) were the spots indicated on his second circuit identical\r\nwith, or even near to, those marked in the first circuit. His father\r\nsaid he was \"upset\" by the blindfolding. We then removed the bandage,\r\nand took him into a large courtyard beneath and across which from one\r\ncorner to another a large subterranean conduit ran. We had arranged\r\nthat the water should be running in abundance through this conduit. We\r\ntold him that such a subterranean channel existed. He was left free\r\nand undisturbed, and his eyes were not bandaged. But he failed to\r\ndiscover the conduit altogether, although he crossed it several times;\r\nand he ended by declaring that his twig indicated subterranean water\r\nat a spot remote from the conduit, where some large vats stood for the\r\npurpose of storing rain-water! All this, of course, tended to prove the\r\nincompetence of the youth as a douser, and to make it probable that\r\nsuch successes as he had obtained elsewhere (and my hostess stated that\r\nthey were very numerous and remarkable, and vouched for by members of\r\nher own family) were due to imposture.\r\n\r\nBut a single case like this does not bring one very far on the way\r\nto deciding the question as to whether there are persons who are\r\ngenuinely and successfully guided to the discovery of subterranean\r\nwater by strange sensations and by spasmodic movements of their limbs\r\nor of hazel-twigs held in the hands, due (as they declare) to an\r\nobscure influence which emanates from subterranean water and from\r\nburied metal. The fact is that we have in the belief in the guidance\r\nof the douser by occult influences a troublesome case of the fallacy\r\nin reasoning expressed by the words, \"post hoc ergo propter hoc,\"\r\nor, to put it in English, \"after this, therefore caused by this.\"\r\nPrimitive man found that this mode of forming a conclusion very often\r\nled to a correct discovery of the connexion between two events, and he\r\nadopted it as a ready method of guidance, although it was frequently\r\nfallacious. It has taken ages, literally ages, to make people discard\r\nthis mode of arriving at a conclusion in serious matters, and it is\r\nstill usual in less vital affairs. To show that B followed upon the\r\noccurrence of A, even once, is, of course, a proper and useful way of\r\nforming a guess or a suggestion as to the cause of B, but still more\r\nis your guess legitimate if the sequence has occurred several times\r\nin your experience. But it is only a guess: a conclusion must not be\r\naccepted on that basis, although lazy and hasty people do adopt such\r\nconclusions. You must find out the details of the nature of A and also\r\nof B, and if possible how the one is connected with the other. And if\r\nyou cannot do that you can still establish your conclusion and confirm\r\nyour guess by showing that B _invariably_ follows upon A, or that (in\r\na long experience) only when A has been present, and never when A has\r\nnot been present, has B occurred. If you cannot prove the truth of your\r\nguess by this experimental demonstration of the exclusion of other\r\ncauses than A or by the experimental demonstration of the invariable\r\noccurrence of B after A has occurred, then you have to seek for\r\nevidence of a real connexion between A and B, though not an invariable\r\none, by collecting a vast number of instances of the occurrence of B\r\nand finding out whether A has preceded it in such a large proportion\r\nof cases (as compared with those in which B has occurred without the\r\nprevious occurrence of A) that the cases in which B follows A cannot be\r\nconsidered as accidental, but indicate a real causal relation of A to B.\r\n\r\nThis is always a difficult undertaking, whether we start with the\r\nguess that B is caused by A or that it is not caused by A. In the case\r\nof water-finding, water is found at depths of 30 feet to 100 feet\r\nand more below the surface by engineers without the aid of \"dousers\"\r\nevery day, and this is so frequent and regular a proceeding that the\r\npercentage of cases in which dousers find water, that is to say in\r\nwhich B--the discovery of water--follows A (A being the employment of\r\na supposed sensitive douser with or without his twig) does not--so far\r\nas I am able to judge without strict statistical evidence--exceed the\r\npercentage of successes in searching and digging for water by ordinary\r\nintelligent men without the introduction of A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nBIRTH-MARKS AND TELEGONY\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO widely-spread \"beliefs\"--in regard to the complicated and not\r\ngenerally familiar subject of the reproduction of animals--are, in\r\naddition to that dealt with in the last chapter, examples of the\r\nunjustified and primitive mode of forming a conclusion known as \"post\r\nhoc ergo propter hoc.\" I refer, firstly, to the belief (which I have\r\nalready mentioned) in the causation of what are called \"birth-marks\"\r\nby \"maternal impressions,\" by which is meant the seeing of unusual and\r\nimpressive things by the mother when with child; and, secondly, to the\r\nbelief that a thoroughbred mare can be so affected or infected by the\r\nsire (say a zebra) of one foal as to convey to the foal of a later sire\r\n(say, a thoroughbred like herself) marks (such as stripes on the legs)\r\nwhich were not present in the second sire, though present in the first\r\nsire. This supposed occurrence is called \"telegony,\" and is by some\r\npersons supposed to occur in dogs, cattle, and other animals, including\r\nman, as well as in the horse.\r\n\r\nThere is little support in ordinary experience for the belief that\r\nbirth-marks are caused by maternal impressions, although some of those\r\nwho are concerned in a professional way with breeding operations cling\r\nto it. In very ancient times we find that there was a belief in it,\r\nas shown by the story of the patriarch Jacob, who, wishing to obtain\r\nthe birth of spotted or parti-coloured lambs from a herd of sheep,\r\nplaced in front of the breeding ewes stakes or rods from which he had\r\nremoved the bark in rings, so as to make them parti-coloured. He was\r\nsupposed to have been successful in this way in impressing the visual\r\nsense of the maternal ewes with \"parti-colouration,\" and the belief was\r\nthat they in consequence produced dappled or parti-coloured lambs. The\r\nbelief, though not general, is widespread among simple folk that such\r\ninfluences can and do act on animals, and it has been, and is by some,\r\nsimilarly held that a human mother may be influenced by surrounding\r\nobjects, so that if her surroundings are beautiful she will produce a\r\nbeautiful child. There is absolutely no ground for this belief--based\r\nupon experiment. It is merely an unreasoning assumption of \"after this,\r\ntherefore because of this,\" based upon the incomplete observation of a\r\nfew accidental cases of vague coincidence and a tenacious clinging to\r\nthe belief that it is so because it is difficult to prove that it is\r\nnot so. No trustworthy investigation or experiment on the subject is on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nBut this unwarranted, untested belief, originating among barbarous\r\npeoples, has led further, owing to the inveterate love of marvels\r\nstill common among us, to the notion (surviving to the present day)\r\nthat the irregular coloured or obscure marks sometimes found on the\r\nskin of a child at birth, and vaguely resembling an animal or a fruit,\r\nor what not, are due to the mother having recently seen, under some\r\nsudden and startling circumstances, the object which the \"birth-mark\"\r\non the child resembles. Thus we have the following stories related in\r\na recent publication (\"Sex Antagonism,\" by Walter Heape, F.R.S.). The\r\nauthor holds that this strange influence of \"maternal impressions\"\r\nis possible--a matter of comparatively small importance, since the\r\nreal question is not as to the \"possibility\" but simply (as in a whole\r\nseries of beliefs as to more or less improbable occurrences) whether\r\nthere is or is not sufficient evidence that the connexion and influence\r\nbelieved in actually exists. Mr. Heape relates (without giving any\r\ndetailed evidence whatever in support of the conclusion which he\r\naccepts) the supposed case of a red \"mark\" like a lizard found on a\r\nnew-born child's breast being \"produced\" by the fall of a lizard from\r\nthe ceiling (the event happened in China) on to its mother's breast\r\nshortly before the child's birth. Another case is that of a woman whose\r\nhusband was brought home from work with his arm lacerated by machinery.\r\nHer child was born soon afterwards, and is stated to have had marks on\r\none arm \"similar to\" those the mother saw on the corresponding arm of\r\nher husband. Another story is that of a lady who had a great craving\r\nfor raspberries before her child was born, and accordingly bore a child\r\nwith a red raspberry mark on its body!\r\n\r\nIn no case does Mr. Heape give any picture of the birth-mark and the\r\nthing supposed to be represented by it, nor state that he has seen\r\neither the mark or a picture of it. In no case is the statement of\r\nthe mother as to her having been \"influenced\" as described in the\r\nnarration, tested or examined in any way.\r\n\r\nThese and similar stories are related to-day, and such stories have\r\nbeen related from time immemorial. But they are always \"hear-say.\" The\r\nwitnesses and the facts are never carefully examined, and the degree\r\nof closeness of the agreement between the mark and its supposed cause\r\nare never really demonstrated. Nor has anyone undertaken a statistical\r\nexamination with the view of showing that the vague agreement of the\r\nmark with the arresting object seen by the mother is anything more\r\nthan an accidental coincidence, nor (in regard to many such stories)\r\nhas it been proved that the mother really did see or notice any such\r\nterrifying object as she afterwards declares (and possibly thinks) she\r\ndid. Moreover, no one has carefully and scientifically made crucial\r\nexperiments with animals, similar to that of the patriarch Jacob. The\r\nexperiments and their record would not be difficult with animals.\r\nThough some farmers may believe that such influences do operate on\r\ntheir breeding dams, there is no known or recognized application\r\nof Jacob's method to the production of desired form or colour in\r\ndomesticated animals. We are not concerned with \"possibilities.\" What\r\nis needed is a series of demonstrative experiments, or critical cases.\r\nAnd these are, as yet, not forthcoming.\r\n\r\nTelegony is the name given to the hypothesis that the offspring of\r\na known sire sometimes inherit characters from a previous mate of\r\ntheir dam. The name means reproduction (Greek, gonos) influenced by\r\na remote agent (Greek, tele = from afar). There is no question about\r\n\"possibility\" here. Such an \"infection\" of a dam by a previous mate\r\nis not improbable. According to Darwin \"farmers in South Brazil are\r\nconvinced that mares which have once borne mules, when subsequently\r\nput to horses, are extremely liable to produce colts striped like a\r\nmule.\" On the other hand, the Baron de Parana states that he has many\r\nrelatives and friends who have large establishments for the rearing of\r\nmules where they obtain from 400 to 1000 mules in a year. In all these\r\nestablishments, after two or three crossings of the mare and ass, the\r\nbreeders cause the mare to be put to a horse; yet the pure-bred foals\r\nso produced have never in a single case resembled either an ass or a\r\nmule.\r\n\r\nA celebrated case to which Darwin attached importance was that of Lord\r\nMorton's mare, reported to the Royal Society in 1820. This mare, after\r\nbearing a hybrid by a quagga (a striped equine related to the zebra)\r\nproduced, to a black Arabian horse, three foals showing a number of\r\nstripes, and in one of them more stripes were present than in the\r\nquagga hybrid. This seems at first sight strong evidence in favour\r\nof \"infection\" of the mare by the early quagga mate. But it appears\r\nthat stripes are frequently seen in high-caste Arab horses, and colts\r\ncross-bred from such and other breeds of horse sometimes present far\r\nmore distinct bars across the legs and other zebra-like markings than\r\nwere seen in the late offspring of Lord Morton's Arabian mare. The fact\r\nappears to be that all the living species of the horse family (horses,\r\nasses, quaggas, and zebras) are descended from an ancestry of \"striped\"\r\nequines, and are liable occasionally to \"throw back\" to their striped\r\nancestry, more or less.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cossar Ewart determined some years ago to submit the matter\r\nto direct experiment, and has related his results in a book (\"The\r\nPenicuik Experiments,\" 1899). The South African equine called the\r\nquagga, which was that used by Lord Morton, having become extinct,\r\nProfessor Ewart made use of a richly striped Burchell's zebra. Thirty\r\nmares put to this animal produced seventeen hybrids, and subsequently\r\nthese mares, put to horse-stallions, produced twenty pure-bred foals.\r\nAll the zebra hybrids were richly and very distinctly striped. Of the\r\ntwenty later pure-bred horse-foals from the same mares three only\r\npresented stripe-like markings at birth, and these were few and\r\nindistinct. They disappeared when the foal's coat was shed. Their\r\nmothers were Highland mares. But the value of the faint striping in\r\nthese three instances as evidence in support of telegony is at once\r\ndestroyed by the fact that Professor Ewart obtained at the same time\r\npure-bred foals from similar Highland mares which had never seen a\r\nzebra. Two of these pure-bred Highland foals showed stripes at birth,\r\nand one acquired stripes later; and further, whilst the stripes on the\r\nfoals born after hybrids had been produced by their mothers disappeared\r\nwith the foal's coat, the stripes on the three pure-bred colts whose\r\nmothers had never been near a zebra persisted for a longer period.\r\nSimilar experiments confirmed these results, showing that traces of\r\nstriping are no more likely to occur on the offspring of a mare which\r\nhas previously produced a mule with a zebra or an ass, than on one\r\nwhose dam has neither seen nor been near to a zebra or an ass. Lord\r\nMorton's case thus falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nBreeders of dogs are (or were) even more thoroughly convinced of the\r\nfact of telegony than breeders of horses. But Sir Everett Millais,\r\nwho devoted thirty years to the breeding of dogs and experiments on\r\nthis question, states that he has never seen a case of telegony. And\r\nrecent experiments of the most definite kind support his conclusion.\r\nDalmatians, deerhounds, and retrievers have been used in these\r\nexperiments. Many such experiments in telegony are accidentally or\r\nunwittingly made every year with dogs. An undesired crossing of\r\ntwo breeds takes place, but when subsequent pure breeding takes\r\nplace no \"telegonic\" infection of the mother is observed. Cases\r\nbelieved to be due to telegony have on examination proved to be due\r\nto the carelessness of stablemen, who have allowed a dog to escape\r\ntemporarily from the kennels or to enter them uninvited. The men have\r\nattributed the mongrels so begotten to telegony in order to conceal\r\ntheir negligence.\r\n\r\nAnother curious case was that of a rickety spaniel puppy, which was\r\nexhibited a few years ago at the Zoological Society and believed by the\r\nexhibitor to owe its bandy legs to \"telegonic\" infection of the mother\r\nby a dachshund, with which she was supposed to have mated a year or\r\nmore before being put to the father of the spaniel. Its true nature was\r\nat once recognized by the experts present, the bandy legs being those\r\ncaused by \"rickets,\" and not like those of the well-known dachshund\r\nbreed.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the explanations widely prevalent of many apparently\r\nstrange things discussed in the preceding chapters, such as live\r\ntoads buried in rocks, the water-finder's mystic rod, the coincidence\r\nof birth-marks and maternal impressions, and the inheritance of\r\noffspring from a previous mate of their dam, are hasty and unverified\r\nsuppositions, which have never been properly tested, and that when the\r\nwonder-provoking statements made and the actual facts in question are\r\nproperly and sufficiently examined, according to the rules of evidence\r\nand common sense, it is discovered that the assumption of occult or\r\nexceptional causes in explanation of such strange things are not\r\njustified, but that these strange things owe their strangeness in large\r\npart to the incorrect and incomplete observation of those who report\r\nthem, and to that love of marvel and mystery which, like hope, springs\r\neternal in the human breast.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable proof of the reality of the belief in\r\ntelegony--though not a proof of the reality of telegony--that amongst\r\nbreeders of horses and dogs the selling value of a dam which has borne\r\nyoung to an inferior sire or to one of a distinct species, is largely\r\ndiminished as compared with that of a dam which has been mated with\r\na first-rate sire of her own breed. Darwin himself was led, by his\r\ninquiries into a similar occurrence in plants, to favour the notion\r\nthat a sire could so \"infect\" a mare that her offspring by a later sire\r\nwould in some instances show traces of the characters of the earlier\r\nsire. The parts of a plant which form the coverings of the fertilized\r\novule, the \"coats\" of the seed and the seed-case and fruit, are, of\r\ncourse, parts of the maternal plant. In each of the ovules which grow\r\nin the central part of a flower (the so-called \"pistil\") is an egg\r\ncell like that of an animal. This is \"fertilized\" by the pollen-grains\r\nwhich are brought by wind or by insects from the \"stamens\" of another\r\nflower. Each pollen-grain thus brought to the surface of the pistil\r\nelongates into a delicate filament, and penetrates into it, and so\r\nreaches an egg cell, with which it fuses. Then the surrounding tissues\r\ngrow and swell up, forming the seed coats and the fruit. They are parts\r\nof the egg-cell-producing or \"mother\" flower. Thus the pulp and \"rind\"\r\nor skin of an orange is part of the mother plant, not of the germs or\r\nyoung embedded in the \"pips.\" It is found that if an orange-flower is\r\ndeliberately fertilized by placing on its pistil the pollen-grains of\r\na lemon-flower, not only are the ovules of the orange fertilized, but\r\nthe surrounding structures, which enlarge to form the fruit and are\r\nparts of the orange plant quite distinct from the ovules, also become\r\naffected by the pollen. In one well-observed case when an orange-flower\r\nwas fertilized by a gardener with the pollen of a lemon-flower, the\r\nskin or rind of the resulting fruit was found to exhibit stripes of\r\nperfectly characterized lemon peel (having the colour and flavour of\r\nlemon peel), alternating with stripes of the proper orange peel.\r\n\r\nThe same thing has been observed in apples, melons, orchids,\r\nrhododendrons, grapes, maize, and peas, when one variety has been\r\nfertilized by the pollen of another, or when one species has been\r\nfertilized by the pollen of an allied but distinct species. The fruit\r\nin these cases (not simply the germ or young plant within it) has been\r\nfound in some instances to have some of the colour, flavour, or shape\r\nand marking of the fertilizing variety or species blended or else mixed\r\nlike a patchwork with that characteristic of the fertilized variety or\r\nspecies. The egg-producing or mother plant not merely has its ovules\r\nfertilized, but its tissues for some distance around are infected and\r\nmade to take on--in parts of their living, growing substance--some of\r\nthe quality of the fertilizing species. A similar thing occurs, though\r\nrarely, when cuttings of one plant are grafted on to another. The\r\nliving tissue either of graft or of stock, and sometimes of both, is\r\naffected by the fusion with it of the tissue of the second plant united\r\nwith it. And this appears to be a kind of \"infection\"--living particles\r\npassing from one to the other, and producing a mosaic or patchwork of\r\nthe two kinds of living substance characteristic of each of the united\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIf an individual flower were to produce in a second year after its\r\nfirst fertilization and seed production a second set of ovules which\r\ncould be fertilized by a kind of pollen differing from the first,\r\nit would not be surprising did that second set of ovules sometimes\r\nshow characteristics due to the infection of the maternal tissues by\r\nthe pollen used in the first year. But flowers do not survive and\r\nproduce ovules in a second year. They are completely used up each year,\r\nand drop off as \"fruits\" from the plant which bears them. With many\r\nanimals, however, the facts are otherwise. The same mother produces\r\nfrom the ovary year after year successive ovules, and it would thus\r\nbe quite intelligible that the fertilizing sperm of one year should\r\nfrequently have so affected or infected the egg-producing organ or\r\novary as to result in the conveyance to the later crop of egg cells\r\nseparated from the ovary, some of the qualities of the earlier male\r\nparent. These considerations warrant the guess or \"hypothesis\" of\r\ntelegony in animals. But all such guesses must be put to the proof,\r\nand not accepted simply because there is no reason to conclude that\r\nthey are impossible. As things at present stand, there is no evidence,\r\nresulting either from deliberate experiment or from exact observation\r\nand record of the natural breeding of animals, to justify us in\r\nholding, as an established fact, that the offspring of a given sire\r\nand dam is, even in rare cases, affected by the previous mating of the\r\ndam with another sire. Naturalists would be deeply interested in the\r\nproduction of even one indisputable instance of this occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this matter it is to be noted that the sperm of one\r\ndrone (her only mate) is retained in an internal sac or pouch, alive\r\nand active, in the queen bee, for some four or five years, and is used\r\nby her in successive seasons for fertilizing her eggs. Similarly it\r\nis recorded by the late Lord Avery that a queen ant kept by him for\r\nfourteen years, without access to a male ant, retained to the end of\r\nthat period the power of producing eggs which developed into worker\r\nants. He concluded that the sperm received fourteen years before by\r\nthis queen from a male ant remained all this time alive and ready\r\nfor use in her sperm-receptacle or sac, since it has been shown that\r\nunfertilized eggs in these and allied insects produce only drones\r\n(males).\r\n\r\nMany strange and unwarranted beliefs persist because mankind prefers to\r\naccept an astonishing assertion as true rather than take the trouble to\r\nsee whether it is so or not. Thus all antiquity and the later learned\r\nworld wrangled about the very existence of Homer's city of Troy, until\r\nSchliemann said, \"Don't talk! Dig!\" and with childlike simplicity and\r\ndirectness uncovered ancient Troy. Thus the belief as to St. Swithin\r\nand his forty days of rain has been shown by the simple examination of\r\nthe actual records of rainfall to be very far from the truth, since,\r\nthough we often have a wet period in July and August, St. Swithin's\r\nDay is nearly as often free from rain in a wet season as the reverse.\r\nForty days of rain very rarely indeed, in the South of England, have\r\nfollowed a wet St. Swithin's Day. The most amusing instance of the\r\npricking of one of these bubbles of belief arose from the inquiry by\r\nsome of the sham philosophers at the Court of King Charles II as to\r\nhow it comes about that if a jar holding water be weighed, and then\r\na live fish be placed therein without spilling any of the water, and\r\nthe jar, with the fish and the water in it, be again weighed, there\r\nis found to be no increase in the observed weight. King Charles, it\r\nis said, made a bet that this was not so, and that there was nothing\r\nto explain. He referred the matter for decision to the newly founded\r\n\"Royal Society for the Promotion of Natural Knowledge,\" which at other\r\ntimes he had asked to give him information as to the magic properties\r\nof the unicorn's horn and the cause of the movements of the recently\r\nimported \"sensitive or humble plant.\" The believers in the marvellous\r\ndisappearance of the weight of a fish placed in a bowl of water held\r\nforth at great length and gave ingenious reasons as to why this is\r\nso. But the King said, \"Don't chatter; make trial!\" And the weighing\r\nwas done, in the King's presence, by some of the Fellows of the Royal\r\nSociety. It was found that the weight of the jar with its contained\r\nwater was increased when the fish was placed therein by exactly the\r\nnumber of ounces which the fish weighed when placed separately in\r\nthe balance. So the King won his bet, and the sham philosophers were\r\nsilenced. The whole spirit of science, as contrasted with that of\r\nsuperstition and ignorance, is summed up by the Royal Society's motto,\r\n\"Nullius in verba\" (on no man's assertion!), and the King's command,\r\n\"Don't chatter; make trial!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nHOW TO PROMOTE SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY BY MONEY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE fact that five years ago Mr. Otto Beit, the brother of the late\r\nMr. Alfred Beit, not only carried out the latter's intention of giving\r\n£50,000 to the promotion of research in connexion with the study of\r\ndisease and the mastery of its causes, but added £150,000 on his own\r\naccount to the amount originally proposed, produced great satisfaction\r\namong scientific men, and also in that large body of the public which,\r\nat the present day, understands something of the importance to the\r\ncommunity of the minute and thorough study of disease, of its mode\r\nof access to man, and of the possibilities, which every day become\r\nbrighter and clearer, of getting rid of it altogether. All honour\r\nand gratitude are due to Mr. Beit for his generous gift and for his\r\nwise appreciation of the good which can be done by proper application\r\nof such a fund. I have reason to know and to value the large-minded\r\ninterest in science which was shown by the late Mr. Alfred Beit, since\r\nhe gave me £1000, some twelve years ago, towards the expenses of\r\nexpeditions which I was organizing for the investigation of the natural\r\nhistory of Lake Tanganyika,--expeditions which have yielded important\r\nscientific results, and have but recently exhausted the fund then\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nIt has often occurred to me that wealthy men who wish to devote large\r\nsums of money to the promotion of scientific research find difficulty\r\nin carrying out their intentions, owing to the fact that they do not\r\nknow enough about the methods and conditions of scientific discovery\r\nto enable them to form a definite independent judgment as to how to\r\nassign their money, so as to make sure that it shall really be employed\r\nin the most effective way towards the end they have in view--namely,\r\nthe increase of scientific discovery. They naturally have some doubts\r\nas to whether the old (or even the new) Universities can help them as\r\ntrustees of the money when they see the importance attached by the\r\nformer to antiquated methods of teaching and examination and observe\r\ntheir traditional cultivation of certain favoured studies, with a\r\nminimum of activity in research and discovery. They mistrust special\r\nsocieties or individuals as advisers in the matter, and sometimes\r\nfinally spend the money which they had destined to be the means of\r\nfurthering scientific discovery upon a costly and ill-considered\r\narchitectural monstrosity dedicated to science, but of little help to\r\nits progress.\r\n\r\nIn past times various schemes have been adopted by benevolent men\r\nfor bequeathing or giving their money so as to promote scientific\r\ndiscovery. Very generally there has been a certain amount of confusion\r\nbetween two distinct purposes--namely, that of creating new knowledge\r\n(the discovery of previously unknown things and new processes), and\r\nthat of spreading existing knowledge amongst an increased proportion\r\nof the community. An admirable endowment for the latter purpose is\r\nthat of Mr. Smithson, a member of the family of the present Duke\r\nof Northumberland, which was refused by the British Government for\r\npeculiar reasons, and conveyed by that gentleman to trustees in\r\nthe United States of America about a hundred years ago, where the\r\nSmithsonian Institution has vastly aided the spread of science. Another\r\nvaluable endowment which has been administered by special trustees for\r\na still longer period is that of the celebrated physician Radcliffe,\r\nto whom we owe the scientific and medical library, an astronomical\r\nobservatory, and travelling fellowships in the University of Oxford.\r\nThe greatest sum dedicated to scientific research in England of late\r\nyears is the noble gift of a quarter of a million sterling made by Lord\r\nIveagh to the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine. There have been\r\nnot a few generous donors of smaller sums for like purposes.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry was set on foot a few years ago in America in order to\r\nobtain the opinions of those who had experience of scientific research\r\nand the institutions intended to promote it in different countries,\r\nas to the best methods to adopt in order to effect such promotion. I\r\ndo not know whether any report was published, but I remember that I\r\nwas consulted on the subject by the late Professor Simon Newcomb, a\r\nforeign member of the Royal Society and one of the most distinguished\r\nscientific discoverers in the United States. I am quite sure that no\r\ngeneral agreement or conclusion on the subject has been arrived at.\r\nSo far as I can see, whenever any high-minded philanthropist desires\r\nto devote in this country a large sum of money to the promotion of\r\nscientific discovery, he is liable to come under the influence of\r\nhighly respectable and eminent persons who, although they have no\r\nacquaintance with the nature of scientific discovery and the way in\r\nwhich it actually takes place, do not hesitate to fix up a scheme based\r\non some antiquated and mistaken model, which is accepted with simple\r\nfaith by the benevolent donor.\r\n\r\nScientific research is a delicate plant, and the secret of the way\r\nin which it may be nurtured has not been revealed to dignitaries and\r\nofficials. It is interesting to note some of the methods which have\r\nbeen tried with the object of nurturing scientific discovery. In every\r\ncase the donor has chosen or created an electing body or trustees of\r\nwhich I will say more below. He has directed this body to expend his\r\ngift with a view to the promotion of scientific discovery in one of\r\nthe following ways: (1) in awarding prizes for discoveries made; (2)\r\nin terminable stipends to junior and senior workers selected by the\r\ntrustees and called scholars or fellows, the stipends being given on\r\ncondition of their holders devoting themselves for a few years to\r\nthe attempt to make discoveries; (3) in permanent salaries to tried\r\nmen, who are thus paid as professors or directors of laboratories and\r\nmuseums; (4) in providing specially designed buildings and apparatus\r\nfor research, but no salaries for the workers; (5) in providing, on\r\nwhatever scale the fund given permits, groups consisting of a professor\r\nor director, two or more assistants, attendants, building, apparatus,\r\nand the annual income necessary for materials of investigation and\r\nmaintenance of the establishment. As to the trustees, or boards\r\nof electors, chosen by the donor, they are often some established\r\nscientific society or some university, or the board may be specially\r\nappointed by him. The last is the best sort of body, if properly\r\nconstituted, but not unfrequently the perplexed promoter of scientific\r\ndiscovery finds himself assenting to the constitution of what is called\r\n\"a representative body\"--say, a bishop, a town councillor, a Secretary\r\nof State, a judge, and a university professor, with other members to\r\nbe nominated by himself or his heirs. Such a board fails from a want of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe methods of applying the income provided by the donor are not\r\nalways such as to produce any marked result in the direction desired\r\nby him. It is generally agreed among scientific workers and experts\r\nthat the giving of prizes or rewards for scientific discovery does\r\nnot tend to increase the output of discoveries, however carefully and\r\njustly awarded. Though such an award as the £8000 or £10,000 of the\r\nNobel prizes is a very agreeable compliment to the man so honoured,\r\nand often richly deserved, no one would urge a would-be promoter of\r\nscientific discovery to devote his gift to the foundation of prizes.\r\nAnd so, too, with regard to scholarships or fellowships, it is very\r\ngenerally and rightly held that they do little or nothing in promoting\r\nscientific discovery when they are small in value and are only to be\r\nheld for two or three years. When a young man has taken his university\r\ndegree in science or medicine a scholarship or fellowship of £250 a\r\nyear for three years offers no inducement to him, if he is an able man,\r\nto abandon his regular professional career. If he accepts it, he will\r\nhave had no time to go far on the path of discovery before it comes\r\nto an end, and he will find at the end of his three years that he has\r\nlost that amount of time so far as his profession is concerned, and\r\nthat there is no life post or career open to him in the line in which\r\nhe has spent three years--namely, that of a scientific investigator.\r\nAs a rule, able men will not be drawn off in this way from their\r\nprofessions, but inferior men may be.\r\n\r\nThe man, on the other hand, who is specially gifted with the power\r\nof scientific discovery will not be affected by such temporary\r\nfellowships. He will enter on the career of discovery with or\r\nwithout such inducements. What such a man (and he is the only sort\r\nof man who matters) really requires, and should find open to him, is\r\nan assured career. This must take the form in the first place of a\r\nsmaller post as assistant to a great discoverer, tenable for twenty\r\nyears if need be, and subsequently a life post, with laboratory and\r\nassistants, when he has proved his possession of the discoverer's\r\nquality. Hence it is that what the benevolent millionaire who wishes\r\nto promote scientific discovery should do is to provide life posts,\r\n\"professorships\" or \"directorships,\" for the really great discoverers,\r\nwho exist often in cramped conditions. They should be of the value of\r\n£1500 to £3000 a year--not too large a stipend in view of the incomes\r\nearned by successful professional men and assigned by Government\r\nto judges, bishops, colonial governors, senior civil servants, and\r\npoliticians--with two or three assistantships of £150 to £500 a year\r\nattached, to be filled up by nominations made by the professor himself\r\nas vacancies occur. A sum of £7500 a year, that which Mr. Otto Beit\r\nhas so generously given, would pay for one professor, with three\r\nassistants, attendants, and interest on building and maintenance fund.\r\nOf course, if such a sum were offered to an existing institution\r\nwhere buildings and other conveniences are already provided, two\r\nresearch professors and their assistants could be paid for where one\r\nonly would be possible if building and service had to be provided.\r\nThere are buildings and laboratories in London and elsewhere\r\nprovided by beneficent founders without stipends for directors and\r\nassistants, and there are already a good many young graduates drawing\r\nterminable inadequate stipends in succession to one another from great\r\nfoundations. The difficulty is to bring about the combination of\r\nadequate funds for the chief and for the graduated minor posts, and for\r\na well-equipped laboratory. When that is done, as it sometimes, though\r\nrarely, is, the only further difficulty is how to choose a real man, an\r\ninspired, inspiring discoverer. There is only one way.\r\n\r\nReal discoverers are extremely rare--great ones are recognized\r\nabout once in fifty years in any one large branch of science. There\r\nmay be others wandering about--undiscovered discoverers. The only\r\npeople who can discover them are men like themselves. Hence, in\r\nGerman universities and all wisely managed institutions for the\r\npromotion of scientific discovery, they give the power of choosing new\r\ndiscoverers to those discoverers already belonging to the university\r\nor institution, and they take care that all the electors are vitally\r\ninterested for the honour, credit, and pecuniary success of their\r\nuniversity. These conditions can be arranged and brought into healthy\r\naction by care and understanding. But the whole fabric may go to\r\npieces, and jobbery and jealousy prevail (as has sometimes happened in\r\nEngland) if care is not taken to identify the personal interests of\r\nthe electors (brother professors) with the honest exercise of their\r\ncapacity to choose a real discoverer to fill a vacancy when it occurs,\r\nor if an ignorant council of \"superior persons\" is allowed to interfere.\r\n\r\nTo find these great discoverers is, indeed, no light task. They have\r\nto be looked for by the State, firstly, in the primary schools;\r\nthe net has to be drawn and the minor fishes allowed to escape,\r\nwhilst the strong and promising are sent on to high schools. Then\r\nagain, after further sifting, some are passed on to the special\r\ncollege, then a selection to the university, and at last one or two\r\na year may be chosen as assistants to an established and inspiring\r\ndiscoverer. Seven, ten, or fifteen years later one out of all his\r\nfellows and predecessors is recognized as the incomparable teacher\r\nand discoverer--the inspirer of others, the one great man of half a\r\ncentury. He must be chosen by his colleagues, his fellow-workers, not\r\nby political wire-pullers nor by any variety of social \"Bumble.\" He is\r\ngiven laboratories and assistants, and men come to consult him, to sit\r\nunder him, work for him, from all parts of the world. Louis Pasteur\r\nwas such a man. Huxley pointed out by what a vast public expenditure\r\nPasteur was gradually sifted out from his fellows, and made professor\r\nin the Normal School of Paris. Of course, a good many inferior people\r\ngot a share of the training provided, and did some unimportant things;\r\nbut if we put them aside it is perfectly true (as a calculation of the\r\nexpenses of the whole network of State-supported schools and colleges\r\nand bursaries through which he passed will show) that the capture or\r\ndiscovery of Pasteur cost the French nation about £25,000,000. He was\r\nworth it, not only to France, but to every other nationality--and more,\r\ntoo, more than can be measured by gold. His name, honoured throughout\r\nthe world on account of the splendid discoveries associated with it,\r\ngave self-respect, courage, and healthy pride to France at a time when\r\nshe had cruelly suffered. Ten years ago the most popular newspaper in\r\nFrance took a \"plebiscite\" to determine who, in the general estimation\r\nof the French people, was the greatest Frenchman of the nineteenth\r\ncentury--the century which included the first Napoleon, Victor\r\nHugo, Gambetta. The vote was given by some millions, and resulted\r\nin a majority for Louis Pasteur. Would Englishmen have shown such\r\ndiscernment? Such a man is absolutely necessary as the head of any\r\ngreat institute which exists for the purpose of scientific discovery.\r\nSuch men, smaller it may be, but of the same inspiring quality, are\r\nthe only men fit to be university professors. It is because there are\r\nstill such men at the Institut Pasteur that it remains a great seat of\r\ndiscovery. It is because they have not such men, and that there is no\r\nintelligent attempt to get them, that many wealthy institutions in our\r\nown country fail to produce scientific fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abies, the genus of the Silver Fir, 317\r\n\r\n  Acorns, sea-, 100, 110\r\n\r\n  Actinia mesembryanthemum, a common sea-anemone, 85, 86\r\n    living in an aquarium for fifty years, 86\r\n\r\n  African animals, preservation of, 20\r\n\r\n  Alchemists and the divining-rod, 385\r\n\r\n  Aldeburgh, amber to be bought there, 74\r\n    the great pebble beach at, 55\r\n\r\n  Alpine flowers, 161\r\n    reason of strong colour of, 167, 168\r\n\r\n  Amber, 71-76\r\n    chemical nature of, 75\r\n    insects in, 73\r\n    uses of, 73, 74\r\n\r\n  Amber-routes, 70\r\n\r\n  Ambleteuse, once a great harbour, 51\r\n\r\n  Amphioxus, 2\r\n\r\n  Anchovy, the, 359\r\n    sauce, its history and colour, 359\r\n\r\n  Anemone, the Weymouth, 88\r\n\r\n  Anemones, sea-, 81, 84, 85, 86\r\n    fertilization of, 186\r\n\r\n  Anthea cereus, a sea-anemone, 86\r\n\r\n  Ape, the lines on the palm of the, 373\r\n    to man, from, 236-291\r\n\r\n  Apes, mental qualities of, 241, 242\r\n\r\n  Aquariums, marine, made fashionable by Mr. Gosse, 83\r\n\r\n  \"Arabian Nights,\" stories as to men turned into fish, 353\r\n\r\n  Araucaria, the monkey-puzzle, 329\r\n\r\n  Arbor vitæ, a kind of cypress, 330\r\n\r\n  Argentière (Switzerland), 164\r\n\r\n  Aril of the yew tree, 310\r\n\r\n  Arthropods or jointed-leg owners, 102, 103\r\n\r\n  Ashtaroth, 352\r\n\r\n  Astrology, 372\r\n\r\n  Atargatis, 352\r\n\r\n  Atlas cedar, 320\r\n\r\n  Augurs, the Roman corporation of, 371\r\n\r\n  Aurelia, the common jelly-fish, 95\r\n\r\n  Australian natives, 29, 30\r\n\r\n  Automata, animals as, 187\r\n\r\n\r\n  Balancers or dwindled wings of the two-winged flies, 218\r\n\r\n  Balanus, the sea-acorn or acorn-barnacle, 110\r\n\r\n  Ballet, Russian Imperial, 169, 177\r\n\r\n  Barnacle, growth and transformation of, 111-113\r\n    the legend of the, and the goose, 118-141\r\n    the ship's, figure of, 109\r\n\r\n  Barnacle-goose, the, 118\r\n\r\n  Barnacles, 100, 108-141\r\n    nauplius young of, discovered by the Army surgeon,\r\n    Vaughan Thompson, 107\r\n    their \"complemental males\" discovered by Darwin, 115\r\n\r\n  Barrett, Sir W.
