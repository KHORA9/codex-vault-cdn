BALLANTYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE HUNTERS.\r\n\r\nIt was on a cold winter morning long ago, that Robin Gore, a bold hunter\r\nof the backwoods of America, entered his parlour and sat him down to\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nRobin's parlour was also his dining-room, and his drawing-room, besides\r\nbeing his bedroom and his kitchen.  In fact, it was the only room in his\r\nwooden hut, except a small apartment, opening off it, which was a\r\nworkshop and lumber-room.\r\n\r\nRobin's family consisted of himself, and his wife, and his son Roy, who\r\nwas twelve years of age--and his daughter Nelly, who was eight, or\r\nthereabout.  In addition to these, his household comprised a nephew,\r\nWalter and an Irishman, Larry O'Dowd.  The former was tall, strong,\r\nfearless, and twenty.  The latter was stout, short, powerful, and forty.\r\n\r\nThe personal history of Robin Gore, to the point at which we take it up,\r\nruns briefly thus:--\r\n\r\nHe had been born in a backwood's settlement, had grown up and married in\r\nthe little hamlet in which he had been born, and hunted around it\r\ncontentedly until he was forty years of age.  But, as population\r\nincreased, he became restive.  He disliked restraint; resolved to take\r\nhis wife and family into the wilderness and, after getting his nephew\r\nand an Irish adventurer to agree to accompany him, carried his\r\nresolution into effect.\r\n\r\nHe travelled several hundreds of miles into the woods--beyond the most\r\nremote settlement--built three wooden huts, surrounded them with a tall\r\nstockade, set up a flagstaff in the centre thereof, and styled the whole\r\naffair, \"Fort Enterprise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to bring you to such a lonesome spot, Molly, my dear,\" said\r\nRobin, as he sat on the trunk of a fallen tree, on the afternoon of the\r\nday on which he arrived at the scene of his future home; \"it'll be\r\nrayther tryin' at first, but you'll soon get used to it, and we won't be\r\nbothered hereaway wi' all the new-fangled notions o' settlement folk.\r\nWe'll dwell in the free wilderness, where there are no tyrannical laws\r\nto hamper a man, an' no nonsensical customs to fix the fashion of his\r\ncoat an' leggins.  Besides, you'll have Roy an' Nelly an' Walter an'\r\nLarry to keep you company, lass, not to mention our neighbours to look\r\nin upon now and again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, Robin,\" replied the wife, \"I have no doubt it will be quite\r\ncheery and homelike in course of time.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked out upon the broad bosom of the lake which lay before the\r\nsite of their forest home, and sighed.  It was evident that Mrs Gore\r\nhad a strong partiality for the laws and customs which her husband\r\nabhorred.\r\n\r\nThe \"neighbours\" to whom Robin referred lived in a leather tent twenty\r\nmiles distant from the Fort.  They were an Indian, named \"The Black\r\nSwan,\" his wife, named \"The White Swan,\" and a half-caste trapper, whose\r\nproper name was unknown to all save himself.  His cognomen in the\r\nwilderness was \"Slugs,\" a name which originated in his frequent use of\r\nclipped pieces of lead instead of shot in the loading of his gun.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the point from which we started:--\r\n\r\nIt was on a cold winter morning that Robin Gore entered his parlour and\r\nsat him down to breakfast.\r\n\r\nIt was not only cold--very cold; colder than ever was experienced in our\r\nfavoured British isles--but it was also very dark.  Robin had risen\r\nbefore daybreak in order to visit his traps, and shoot some game as\r\nearly in the day as possible.  The larder chanced to be nearly empty\r\nthat day, a fact which was all the more to be regretted that it was New\r\nYear's day, and, as Robin remarked, \"that day didn't occur more than\r\nonce in the year.\"  This statement Larry O'Dowd disputed, affirming that\r\nit occurred \"at laste twice ivery year--wance at the beginnin' an' wance\r\nat the end of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, lad,\" said Robin, trimming the candle as his nephew Walter\r\nentered, \"we'll ha' to make the most of our time to-day, for we dine at\r\nsharp five p.m., an' our dinner--leastwise the most of it--is at this\r\nmoment alive an' kickin', if it's not sleepin', in the forest, and has\r\ngot to be found and shot yet.  Hallo! boy, where are _you_ bound for?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the woods, father, with you and Walter,\" replied his son Roy,\r\nsitting down and coolly helping himself to a portion of bear's meat,\r\nwith which the hunter was regaling himself.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, boy,\" said Robin, somewhat gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"You'll not be able to keep up with us,\" added Walter, \"for we've little\r\ntime before us, an' a long way to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I break down I can turn back,\" retorted Roy.\r\n\r\n\"Very good; please yourself;\" said Robin in a tone of indifference,\r\nalthough his glance seemed to indicate that he was not sorry to see his\r\nboy determined to attempt an expedition which he knew from experience\r\nwould be very trying to a lad of his years.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, the three hunters clothed themselves in habiliments\r\nsuitable to the climate--leathern coats and trousers which were\r\nimpervious to the wind; cloth leggings to keep the snow from the\r\ntrousers; leather mocassins, or shoes with three pairs of blanket socks\r\ninside of them; fur-caps with ear-pieces; leather mittens with an\r\napartment for the fingers and a separate chamber for the thumb,\r\npowder-horns, shot-pouches, guns, and snow-shoes.  These latter were\r\nlight wooden frames, netted across with deerskin threads, about five\r\nfeet long and upwards of a foot wide.  The shoes were of this enormous\r\nsize, in order that they might support the wearers on the surface of the\r\nsnow, which was, on an average, four feet deep in the woods.  They were\r\nclumsy to look at, but not so difficult to walk in as one might suppose.\r\n\r\nIn silence the three hunters entered the dark woods in front of Fort\r\nEnterprise.  Robin went first and beat the track, Walter followed in his\r\nfootsteps, Roy brought up the rear.  The father sank about six inches at\r\nevery step, but the snow which fell upon his snow-shoes was so fine and\r\ndry, owing to the intense frost, that it fell through the net-work of\r\nthe shoes like dust.  Walter and Roy, treading in the footsteps, had\r\nless labour in walking, but Walter, being almost as strong as his uncle,\r\ntook his turn at beating the track every two hours.\r\n\r\nThrough the woods they went, over mound and hollow, across frozen swamp\r\nand plain, through brush and break, until near noon, when they halted\r\nfor rest and refreshment.  While Walter cut firewood, Robin and Roy\r\ncleared away the snow, using their snow-shoes as shovels, and prepared\r\ntheir meal.  It was simple; a few mouthfuls of dried meat and a tin can\r\nof hot tea--the backwoodsman's greatest luxury, next to his pipe.  It\r\nwas short, too.  Half an hour sufficed to prepare and consume it.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see, now, what we have got,\" said Robin, counting the game before\r\nresuming the march.\r\n\r\n\"More than enough,\" said Walter, lighting his pipe for a hurried whiff,\r\n\"ten brace of white grouse, four rabbits, six red foxes and a black one,\r\nand two wolves.  We can't eat all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely we won't eat the foxes and wolves!\" cried Roy, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Not till we're starvin',\" replied his father.  \"Come, let's go on--are\r\nye tired, lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fresh as Walter,\" said the boy, proudly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we won't try you too much.  We'll just take a sweep round by the\r\nWolf's Glen, an' look at the traps there--after which make for home and\r\nhave our New Year's dinner.  Go ahead, Walter, and beat the track; it is\r\nyour turn this time.\"\r\n\r\nWithout speaking, Walter slipped his feet into the lines of his\r\nsnow-shoes, extinguished his pipe, and led the way once more through the\r\npathless forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE STARVED INDIAN.\r\n\r\nIn the depths of the same forest, and not far from the locality to which\r\nwe have introduced our reader, a Red Indian was dragging his limbs\r\nwearily along over the untrodden snow.\r\n\r\nThe attenuated frame of this son of the soil, his hollow cheeks and\r\nglaring eye-balls, his belt drawn with extreme tightness round his\r\nwaist, to repress the gnawings of hunger, as well as his enfeebled gait,\r\nproved that he was approaching the last stage of starvation.\r\n\r\nFor many weeks Wapaw had been travelling in the woods, guided on his way\r\nby the stars, and by those slight and delicate signs of the wilderness--\r\nsuch as the difference of thickness in the bark on the north, from that\r\non the south side of a tree--which are perceptible only to the keen eye\r\nof an Indian, or a white man whose life has been spent in the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nBut Wapaw was a very different man, when he quitted his tribe, from what\r\nhe was at the time we introduce him to our reader.  Strong, wiry,\r\nupright, and lithe as a panther, he left his wigwam and his wife, and\r\nturned his face towards the rising sun; but the season was a severe one,\r\nand game was scarce; from the very beginning of his journey he had found\r\nit difficult to supply himself with a sufficiency of food.  Towards the\r\nmiddle of it he was on short allowance, and much reduced in strength;\r\nand now near its termination, he was, as we have said, almost in the\r\nlast stage of starvation.\r\n\r\nFort Enterprise was Wapaw's goal.  He had never been there before, but\r\nfrom the description of the place and its locality, given by those of\r\nhis kindred who had visited Robin Gore, he was able to direct his march\r\nwith unerring certainty towards it.  Of course, as he drew near to it he\r\ncould not ascertain his exact distance--whether he was a day or several\r\ndays' journey off--but from the tracks of Robin's snow-shoes, which he\r\ncrossed more than once, he guessed that he was nearing the Fort, and\r\npushed on with renewed hope and energy.\r\n\r\nRobin, however, was an active hunter.  He often made long and rapid\r\nmarches from his lonely dwelling--sometimes staying away a week or two\r\nat a time even in winter; so that Wapaw thought himself nearer Fort\r\nEnterprise than he really was, when he first discovered the bold\r\nhunter's tracks.  When, at length, he did arrive at less than a day's\r\njourney from the Fort, he was not aware of its close proximity, and,\r\nhaving tasted nothing whatever for two days, he felt the approach of\r\nthat terrible state of exhaustion which precedes death.\r\n\r\nIt was a somewhat stormy day when the poor Indian's strength finally\r\nbroke down.  Hitherto he had pushed forward with some degree of hope,\r\nbut on the morning of this day a broken branch caught his snow-shoe and\r\ntripped him.  At any other time the fall would have been a trifle, but\r\nin his weak condition it acted like the last straw which breaks the\r\ncamel's back.  Wapaw rose with difficulty, and brushing the snow from\r\nhis eyes, looked earnestly at his snow-shoes, well knowing that if they\r\nhad been broken in the fall his power of advancing would have been taken\r\naway and his fate sealed, for he had neither strength nor energy left to\r\nrepair them.  They were uninjured, however; so he once more attempted to\r\nstagger on.\r\n\r\nA slight rising ground lay before him.  To ascend this was a labour so\r\ngreat that he almost sank in the midst of it.  He reached the top,\r\nhowever, and gazed eagerly before him.  He had gazed thus at the top of\r\nevery rising ground that he had reached during the last two days, in the\r\nhope of seeing some sign of the Fort.\r\n\r\nA deep sigh escaped him as he rested his hands on the muzzle of his gun,\r\nand his grave countenance was overspread with a look of profound\r\nmelancholy.  For the first time in his life, the once stout and active\r\nWapaw had reached the point of giving way to despair.  A wide open plain\r\nstretched out before him.  The cold wind was howling wildly across it,\r\ndriving the keen snow-drift before it in whirling clouds.  Even a strong\r\nman might have shrunk from exposing himself on such a plain and to such\r\na blast on that bitter arctic day.  Wapaw felt that, in his case, to\r\ncross it would be certain death; so, with the calm philosophy of a Red\r\nIndian, he made up his mind to lay him down and die!\r\n\r\nHis manner of preparing for his end was somewhat singular.  Turning\r\naside into the woods, he set about making an encampment with as much\r\nvigour as he could summon up.  Clearing away the snow from the roots of\r\na large spreading pine-tree, he strewed branches on the ground, and thus\r\nmade a rude couch.  On this he spread his blanket.  Then he cut some\r\nfirewood with the axe that hung at his side, and soon kindled, by means\r\nof flint, steel, and tinder, a good fire.  Seating himself before the\r\nwarm blaze, the exhausted man rested awhile, with his legs drawn\r\ntogether and his head resting on his knees.\r\n\r\nHe sat so long thus that he nearly fell asleep.  Presently he roused\r\nhimself, and proceeded to make a close examination of his wallet and\r\nfirebag--the latter being a beautifully ornamented pouch, which Indians\r\nand fur-traders wear at their belts, for the purpose of containing the\r\nmaterials for producing fire, besides pipes and tobacco.\r\n\r\nPoor Wapaw had already searched his wallet and firebag twice, without\r\nfinding a crumb of food or a morsel of tobacco.  He knew well that they\r\nwere empty, yet he turned them inside out, and examined the seams and\r\ncorners with as much earnestness as if he really expected to find relief\r\nfrom his sufferings there.\r\n\r\nThere was no expression of pain on the red man's face--only a look of\r\nprofound melancholy.\r\n\r\nHe laid aside the firebag after a little while, and then quietly drew\r\nhis knife, and cut a piece of leather from the skirt of his hunting\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\nThe leather had been dried and smoked, and contained no substance\r\nwhatever that could sustain life.  Wapaw was aware of this--nevertheless\r\nhe singed a portion of it until it was reduced almost to ashes, and\r\nmingling a little snow with this, ate it greedily.\r\n\r\nThen, raising his eyes to the sky with a long earnest gaze, he sat\r\nimmovable, until the sinking fire and the increasing cold recalled his\r\nwandering faculties.\r\n\r\nThere was a wild, glassy look about the Indian's eyes now, which\r\nprobably resulted from exhaustion.  He seemed to struggle several times\r\nto rouse himself before he succeeded; shuddering with intense cold, he\r\ncrept to the little pile of firewood, and placed several billets on the\r\nfire, which speedily blazed up again, and the dying man cowered over it,\r\nregardless of the smoke which ever and anon wreathed round his drooping\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Wapaw started up as if new energy had been infused into\r\nhim.  He placed his gun, axe, firebag, and powder-horn by themselves on\r\nthe ground; then he wrapped himself in his blanket and lay slowly down\r\nbeside them with his feet towards the fire.  For a few minutes he lay on\r\nhis back, gazing earnestly upwards, while his lips moved slowly, but no\r\nsound issued from them.  Then he turned wearily on his side, and,\r\ncovering his head with the blanket and turning his face towards the\r\nground, he resigned himself to death.\r\n\r\nBut God had ordained that, at that time, the red man should not die.\r\n\r\nAbout the time when he lay down, our hunters emerged upon the plain\r\nwhich had caused the Indian to despair.\r\n\r\n\"It's of no use goin' farther,\" observed Robin, as he and his companions\r\nstood at the edge of the forest and looked across the plain; \"the wind\r\nblows too hard, and the drift is keen; besides there ain't much to be\r\ngot hereaway, even in seasons of plenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father! is that smoke risin' over the bluff yonder?\" asked Roy,\r\npointing with his finger as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of it, lad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indians, may be,\" said Walter.\r\n\r\nRobin shook his head.  \"Don't think so,\" said he, \"for the redskins\r\ndon't often come to see me at this time o' the year.  But we'll go see;\r\nan' look to your primin', lads--if it's a war-party we'll ha' to fight,\r\nmayhap, if we don't run.\"\r\n\r\nThe three hunters crossed the plain in the teeth of the howling drift,\r\nand cautiously approached the bluff referred to by Roy, and from behind\r\nwhich the smoke ascended.\r\n\r\n\"It's a camp fire,\" whispered Robin, as he glanced back at his\r\ncompanions, \"but I see no one there.  They must have just left the\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a shade of anxiety in the hunter's voice as he spoke, for he\r\nthought of Fort Enterprise, its defenceless condition, and the\r\npossibility of the Indians having gone thither.\r\n\r\n\"They can't have gone to the Fort,\" said Walter, \"else we should have\r\nseen their tracks on the way hither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Robin, stepping forward quickly, \"we can see their tracks\r\nnow, anyhow, and follow them up, and if they lead to the Fort.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunter did not finish his sentence, for at that moment he caught\r\nsight of the recumbent form of Wapaw in the camp.\r\n\r\n\"Hist!  A redskin alone, and asleep!  Well, I never did 'xpect to see\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mayhap, he's a decoy-duck,\" suggested Walter.  \"Better look sharp out.\"\r\n\r\nRobin and Roy heeded not the caution.  They at once went forward, and\r\nthe father lifted the blanket from the Indian's head.\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" exclaimed Roy, in a solemn tone.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, lad! but I do b'lieve the poor critter's a'most gone wi'\r\nstarvation.  Come, bestir you, boys--rouse up the fire, and boil the\r\nkettle.\"\r\n\r\nWalter and Roy did not require a second bidding.  The kettle was ere\r\nlong singing on a blazing fire.  The Indian's limbs were chafed and\r\nwarmed; a can of hot tea was administered, and Wapaw soon revived\r\nsufficiently to look up and thank his deliverers.\r\n\r\n\"Now, as good luck has it, I chanced to leave my hand-sled at the Wolf's\r\nGlen.  Go, fetch it, Roy,\" said Robin.\r\n\r\nThe lad set off at once, and, as the glen was not far distant, soon\r\nreturned with a flat wooden sledge, six feet long by eighteen inches\r\nbroad, on which trappers are wont to pack their game in winter.  On this\r\nsledge Wapaw was firmly tied, and dragged by the hunters to Fort\r\nEnterprise.\r\n\r\n\"Hast got a deer, father?\" cried little Nelly, as she bounded in advance\r\nof her mother to meet the returning party.\r\n\r\n\"No, Nelly--'tis dearer game than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? a redskin!\" exclaimed Dame Gore in surprise; \"is he dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nor likely to die,\" said Robin, \"he's in a starvin' state though,\r\nan'll be none the worse of a bit of our New Year's dinner.  Here is game\r\nenough for one meal an' more; come, lass, get it ready as fast as may\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying the bold hunter passed through the Fort gate, dragging the red\r\nman behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR A FEAST.\r\n\r\n\"Why so grave, Robin?\" inquired Mrs Gore, when her husband returned to\r\nthe parlour after seeing Wapaw laid in a warm corner of the kitchen, and\r\ncommitted to the care of Larry O'Dowd.\r\n\r\n\"Molly, my dear, it's of no use concealin' things from you, 'cause when\r\nbad luck falls we must just face it.  This Injun--Wapaw, he calls\r\nhimself--tells me he has com'd here a-purpose, as fast as he could, to\r\nsay that his tribe have resolved to attack me, burn the Fort, kill all\r\nthe men, and carry you off into slavery.\"\r\n\r\n\"God help me! can this be true?\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough, I don't doubt, 'cause Wapaw has the face of an honest man,\r\nand I believe in faces.  He says some of the worst men of his tribe are\r\nin power just now; that they want the contents of my store without\r\npaying for them; that he tried to get them to give up the notion, but\r\nfailed.  On seeing that they were bent on it, he said he was going off\r\nto hunt, and came straight here to warn me.  He says they talked of\r\nstarting for the Fort two days after he did, and that he pushed on as\r\nfast as he could travel, so it's not likely they'll be here for two or\r\nthree days yet.  I'll get ready for them, hows'ever, and when the\r\nreptiles do come they'll meet with a warm reception, I warrant them;\r\nmeanwhile, do you go and get dinner ready.  We won't let such varmints\r\ninterfere with our New Year's feast.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Robin's wife went to her larder, his children were in the kitchen\r\ntending the Indian with earnest solicitude, and Larry was preparing a\r\nlittle soup for him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like rabbit soup?\" asked Nelly, kneeling beside the pallet of\r\npine branches on which Wapaw lay.\r\n\r\nThe Indian smiled, and said something in his native tongue.\r\n\r\n\"Sure he don't onderstan' ye,\" exclaimed Larry, as he bustled in an\r\nenergetic way amongst his pots and pans.\r\n\r\n\"Let me try him with Cree,\" said Roy, kneeling beside his sister, \"I\r\nknow a little--a _very_ little Cree.\"\r\n\r\nRoy tried his \"very little Cree,\" but without success.\r\n\r\n\"It's o' no use,\" he said, \"father must talk to him, for _he_ knows\r\nevery language on earth, I believe.\"\r\n\r\nRoy's idea of the number of languages \"on earth\" was very limited.\r\n\r\n\"Och! don't bother him, see, here is a lingo that every wan\r\nonderstan's,\" cried Larry, carrying a can of hot soup towards Wapaw.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let me! _do_ let me!\" cried Nelly, jumping up and seizing the can.\r\n\r\n\"Be all manes,\" said Larry, resigning it.\r\n\r\nThe child once more knelt by the side of the Indian and held the can to\r\nhim, while he conveyed the soup to his lips with a trembling, unsteady\r\nhand.  The eyes of the poor man glittered as he gazed eagerly at the\r\nfood, which he ate with the avidity of a half-famished wolf.\r\n\r\nHis nurses looked on with great satisfaction, and when Wapaw glanced up\r\nfrom time to time in their faces, he was advised to continue his meal\r\nwith nods and smiles of goodwill.\r\n\r\nGreat preparations were made for the dinner of that New Year's Day.\r\nThose who \"dwell at home at ease\" have no idea of the peculiar feelings\r\nwith which the world's wanderers hail the season of Christmas and New\r\nYear.  Surrounded as they usually are by strange scenes, and ignorant as\r\nthey are of what friends at home are doing or thinking, they lay hold of\r\nthis season as being one point at least in the circle of the year in\r\nwhich they can unite with the home circle, and, at the _same time_,\r\ncommemorate with them the birth of the blessed Saviour of mankind, and\r\nthink with them of absent friends.  Much, therefore, as the \"happy\"\r\nseason is made of in the \"old country,\" it is made more of, if possible,\r\nin the colonies; especially on the outskirts of the world, where the\r\nadventurous and daring have pitched their tents.\r\n\r\nOf course Robin Gore and his household did not think of the \"old\r\ncountry,\" for they were descendants of settlers; but they had imbibed\r\nthe spirit of the old country from their forefathers, and thought of\r\nthose well-remembered friends whom they had left behind them in the\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the delay caused by the conveying of Wapaw to the Fort,\r\nthe hunters had walked so fast that there was still some time to spare\r\nbefore dinner should be ready.\r\n\r\nRoy resolved to devote this time to a ramble in the woods with his\r\nsister Nelly.  Accordingly the two put on their snow-shoes, and, merely\r\nsaying to their mother that they were going to take a run in the woods,\r\nset forth.\r\n\r\nNow, it must be known that Mrs Gore had looked forward to New Year's\r\nDay dinner with great interest and much anxiety.  There was a general\r\nfeeling of hilarity and excitement among the male members of the\r\nself-exiled family that extended itself to the good woman, and induced\r\nher to resolve that the entire household should have what Walter styled\r\na \"rare blow-out!\"  During the whole morning she had been busy with the\r\npreparation of the various dishes, among which were a tart made of\r\ncloudberry jam, a salt goose, and a lump of bear's ham, besides the\r\nrabbits and ptarmigan which had been shot that day.\r\n\r\n\"That's the way to do it, Molly,\" cried Robin, as he opened the door and\r\npeeped in upon his wife during the height and heat of her culinary\r\nlabours; \"keep the pot bilin', my dear, and don't spare the butter this\r\nday.  It only comes once a year, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twice,\" muttered Larry in a low voice, as he stirred the contents of a\r\nlarge pot which hung over the fire.\r\n\r\n\"And see that you look after Wapaw,\" continued Robin.  \"Don't give him\r\ntoo much at first, it'll hurt him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that,\" replied Larry, \"he's got so much a'ready that he\r\ncouldn't howld another morsel av he was to try.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, take care of him, anyhow,\" said Robin, with a laugh;\r\n\"meanwhile I'll go see after the defences o' the Fort, and make all\r\nsnug.\"\r\n\r\nBy dint of unwearied perseverance the dinner was cooked, and then it\r\noccurred to Robin to ask where the children were, but no one could tell,\r\nso the hunter remarked quietly that they would \"doubtless make their\r\nappearance in a short while.\"\r\n\r\nGradually the dinner reached that interesting point which is usually\r\nstyled \"ready to dish.\"  Whereupon Robin again asked where the children\r\nwere.  Still no one could tell, so he said he would go out and hail\r\nthem.  Loudly and long did the hunter call, but no one answered; then he\r\nmade a rapid search in and about the Fort, but they were not to be\r\nfound.  Moreover, a snow-storm had begun to set in, and the drift\r\nrendered it difficult to distinguish tracks in the snow.\r\n\r\nAt last the day's labours were brought to a close.  Dinner was served,\r\nand smoked invitingly on the table.  The party only awaited the return\r\nof Robin with the children.  In a few minutes Robin entered hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Molly,\" said he, in a tone of anxiety, \"the foolish things have gone\r\ninto the woods, I think.  Come, lads, we must hunt them down.  It's\r\nsnowin' hard, so we've no time to lose.\"\r\n\r\nWalter and Larry at once put on their capotes, fur-caps, and snow-shoes,\r\nand sallied forth, leaving Mrs Gore seated alone, and in a state of\r\ndeep anxiety, by the side of her untasted New Year's Day dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nLOST IN THE SNOW.\r\n\r\nWhen Roy and Nelly set out for a ramble, they had at first no intention\r\nof going beyond their usual haunts in the woods around the Fort; but Roy\r\nhad been inspirited by his successful march that day with his father and\r\nWalter, and felt inclined to show Nelly some new scenes to which they\r\nhad not, up to that time, dared to penetrate together.\r\n\r\nThe snow-storm, already referred to, had commenced gradually.  When the\r\nchildren set forth on their ramble only a few flakes were falling, but\r\nthey had not been away half an hour when snow fell so thickly that they\r\ncould not see distinctly more than a few yards ahead of them.  There was\r\nno wind, however, so they continued to advance, rather pleased than\r\notherwise with the state of things.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I _do_ like to see falling snow,\" cried Nelly, with a burst of\r\nanimation.\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" said Roy, looking back at his sister with a bright smile,\r\n\"and I like it best when it comes down thick and heavy, in big flakes,\r\non a _very_ calm day, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, oh it's so nice,\" responded Nelly sympathetically.\r\n\r\nThey paused for minutes to shake some of the snow from their garments,\r\nand beat their hands together, for their fingers were cold, and to laugh\r\nboisterously, for their hearts were merry.  Then they resumed their\r\nmarch, Roy beating the track manfully and Nelly following in his\r\nfootsteps.\r\n\r\nIn passing beneath a tall fir-tree Roy chanced to touch a twig.  The\r\nresult was literally overwhelming, for in a moment he was almost buried\r\nin snow, to the unutterable delight of his sister, who stood screaming\r\nwith laughter as the unfortunate boy struggled to disentomb himself.\r\n\r\nIn those northern wilds, where snow falls frequently and in great\r\nabundance, masses are constantly accumulating on the branches of trees,\r\nparticularly on the pines, on the broad flat branches of which these\r\nmasses attain to considerable size.  A slight touch is generally\r\nsufficient to bring these down, but, being soft, they never do any\r\ninjury worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nWhen Roy had fairly emerged from the snow he joined his sister in the\r\nlaugh, but suddenly he stopped, and his face became very grave.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Nelly, with an anxious look.\r\n\r\n\"My snow-shoe's broken,\" said Roy.\r\n\r\nThere was greater cause for anxiety on account of this accident than the\r\nreader is perhaps aware of.  It may be easily understood that in a\r\ncountry where the snow averages four feet in depth, no one can walk\r\nhalf-a-mile without snow-shoes without being thoroughly exhausted; on\r\nthe other hand, a man can walk thirty or forty miles a day by means of\r\nsnow-shoes.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you mend it?\" asked Nelly.\r\n\r\nRoy, who had been carefully examining the damaged shoe, shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I've nothing here to do it with; besides, it's an awful smash.  I must\r\njust try to scramble home the best way I can.  Come, it's not very far,\r\nwe'll only be a bit late for dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThe snow-shoe having been bandaged, after a fashion, with a\r\npocket-handkerchief, the little wanderers began to retrace their steps;\r\nbut this was now a matter of extreme difficulty, owing to the quantity\r\nof snow which had fallen and almost obliterated the tracks.  The broken\r\nshoe, also, was constantly giving way, so that ere long the children\r\nbecame bewildered as well as anxious, and soon lost the track of their\r\noutward march altogether.  To make matters worse, the wind began to blow\r\nclouds of snow-drift into their faces, compelling them to seek the\r\ndenser parts of the forest for shelter.\r\n\r\nThey wandered on, however, in the belief that they were drawing nearer\r\nhome every step, and Roy, whose heart was stout and brave, cheered up\r\nhis sister's spirit so much that she began to feel quite confident their\r\ntroubles would soon be over.\r\n\r\nPresently all their hopes were dashed to the ground by their suddenly\r\nemerging upon an open space, close to the very spot where the snow-mass\r\nhad fallen on Roy's head.  After the first feeling of alarm and\r\ndisappointment had subsided, Roy plucked up heart and encouraged Nelly\r\nby pointing out to her that they had at all events recovered their old\r\ntrack, which they would be very careful not to lose sight of again.\r\n\r\nPoor Nelly whimpered a little, partly from cold and hunger as well as\r\nfrom disappointment, as she listened to her brother's words; then she\r\ndried her eyes and said she was ready to begin again.  So they set off\r\nonce more.  But the difficulty of discerning the track, if great at\r\nfirst, was greater now, because the falling and drifting snow had\r\nwell-nigh covered it up completely.  In a very few minutes Roy stopped,\r\nand, confessing that he had lost it again, proposed to return once more\r\nto their starting point to try to recover it.  Nelly agreed, for she was\r\nby this time too much fatigued and alarmed to have any will of her own,\r\nand was quite ready to do whatever she was told without question.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering about for nearly an hour in this state of uncertainty,\r\nRoy at last stopped, and, putting his arm round his sister's waist, said\r\nthat he had lost himself altogether!  Poor Nelly, whose heart had been\r\ngradually sinking, fairly broke down; she hid her face in her brother's\r\nbosom, and wept.\r\n\r\n\"Come now, don't do that, dear Nell,\" said Roy, tenderly, \"I'll tell you\r\nwhat we shall do--we'll camp in the snow!  We have often done it close\r\nto the house, you know, for fun, so we'll do it now in earnest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's so dark and cold,\" sobbed Nelly, looking round with a shudder\r\ninto the dark recesses of the forest, which were by that time enshrouded\r\nby the gathering shades of night; \"and I'm _so_ hungry too!  Oh me! what\r\n_shall_ we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now _don't_ get so despairing,\" urged Roy, whose courage rose in\r\nproportion as his sister's sank; \"it's not such an awful business after\r\nall, for father is sure to scour the woods in search of us, an' if we\r\nonly get a comfortable encampment made, an' a roarin' fire kindled, why,\r\nwe'll sit beside it an' tell stories till they find us.  They'll be sure\r\nto see the fire, you know, so come--let's to work.\"\r\n\r\nRoy said this so cheerfully that the child felt a little comforted,\r\ndried her eyes, and said she would \"help to make the camp.\"\r\n\r\nThis matter of making an encampment in the snow, although laborious\r\nwork, was by no means a novelty to these children of the backwoods.\r\nThey had often been taught how to do it by Cousin Walter and Larry\r\nO'Dowd, and had made \"playing at camps\" their chief amusement in fine\r\nwinter days.  When, therefore, they found themselves compelled to\r\n\"camp-out\" from necessity, neither of them was at a loss how to proceed.\r\nRoy drew a circle in the snow, about three yards in diameter, at the\r\nfoot of a large tree, and then both set to work to dig a hole in this\r\nspace, using their snow-shoes as shovels.  It took an hour's hard work\r\nto reach the ground, and when they did so the piled-up snow all round\r\nraised the walls of this hole to the height of about six feet.\r\n\r\n\"Now for bedding,\" cried Roy, scrambling over the walls of their camp\r\nand going into the woods in search of a young pine-tree, while Nelly sat\r\ndown on the ground to rest after her toil.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark night, and the woods were so profoundly obscured, that Roy\r\nhad to grope about for some time before he found a suitable tree.\r\nCutting it down with the axe which always hung at his girdle, he\r\nreturned to camp with it on his shoulder, and cut off the small soft\r\nbranches, which Nelly spread over the ground to the depth of nearly half\r\na foot.  This \"pine-brush,\" as it is called, formed a soft elastic\r\ncouch.\r\n\r\nThe fire was the next business.  Again Roy went into the bush and\r\ngathered a large bundle of dry branches.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Nelly, do you break a lot of the small twigs,\" said Roy, \"and I'll\r\nstrike a light.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled his firebag from his belt as he spoke, and drew from it flint,\r\nsteel, and tinder.  No one ever travels in the wilds of which we write\r\nwithout such means of procuring fire.  Roy followed the example of his\r\nelder companions in carrying a firebag, although he did not, like them,\r\ncarry tobacco and pipe in it.\r\n\r\nSoon the bright sparks that flew from the flint caught on the tinder.\r\nThis was placed in a handful of dry grass, and whirled rapidly round\r\nuntil it was fanned into a flame.  Nelly had prepared another handful of\r\ndry grass with small twigs above it.  The light was applied, the fire\r\nleaped up, more sticks were piled on, and at last the fire roared\r\nupward, sending bright showers of sparks into the branches overhead,\r\nlighting the white walls of the camp with a glow that caused them to\r\nsparkle as with millions of gems, and filling the hearts of the children\r\nwith a sensation of comfort and gladness, while they stood before the\r\nblaze and warmed themselves, rubbing their hands and laughing with glee.\r\n\r\nNo one, save those who have experienced it, can form any conception of\r\nthe cheering effect of a fire in the heart of a dark wood at night.  Roy\r\nand Nelly quite forgot their lost condition for a short time, in the\r\nenjoyment of the comforting heat and the bright gladsome blaze.  The\r\nbrother cut firewood until he was rendered almost breathless, the sister\r\nheaped on the wood until the fire roared and leaped high above their\r\nheads.  Strange though it may appear to some, the snow did not melt.\r\nThe weather was too cold for that; only a little of that which was\r\nnearest the fire melted--the snow walls remained hard frozen all round.\r\nRoy soon sat down to rest, as close to the fire as he could without\r\ngetting scorched; then Nelly seated herself by his side and nestled her\r\nhead in his breast.  There they sat, telling stories and gazing at the\r\nfire, and waiting for \"father to come.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Robin and his comrade ranged the forest far and near in\r\ndesperate anxiety.  But it was a wide and wild country.  The children\r\nhad wandered far away; a high ridge of land hid their fire from view.\r\nMoreover, Robin, knowing the children's usual haunts, had chanced to go\r\noff in the wrong direction.  When night set in the hunters returned to\r\nFort Enterprise to procure ammunition and provisions, in order to\r\ncommence a more thorough and prolonged search.  Poor Mrs Gore still sat\r\nbeside the cold and untasted feast, and there the hunters left her,\r\nwhile they once more plunged into the pathless wilderness to search for\r\nthe lost ones on that luckless New Year's Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nCARRIED OFF.\r\n\r\nWhile Robin Gore and his companions were anxiously searching the woods\r\naround Fort Enterprise for the lost children, a war-party of savages was\r\nmaking its way swiftly towards the Fort.\r\n\r\nA chief of the Indians, named Hawk, who was a shrewd as well as a bad\r\nman, had suspected Wapaw's intentions in quitting the camp of his people\r\nalone and in such unnecessary haste.  This man had great influence over\r\nhis fellows, and easily prevailed on them to set off on their murderous\r\nexpedition against the Fort of the \"pale-faces\" without delay.\r\n\r\nBeing well supplied with food, they travelled faster than their starving\r\ncomrade, and almost overtook him.  They finally encamped within a short\r\ndistance of the Fort the day after Wapaw's arrival, and prepared to\r\nassault it early next morning.\r\n\r\n\"If the wicked skunk has got there before us,\" said Hawk to his fellows,\r\nas they prepared to set out before daybreak, \"the pale-faces will be\r\nready for us, and we may as well go back to our wigwams at once; but if\r\nthat badger's whelp has been slow of foot, we shall hang the scalps of\r\nthe pale-faces at our belts, and eat their food this day.\"\r\n\r\nThe polite titles above used by Hawk were meant to refer to Wapaw.\r\n\r\nIndians are not naturally loquacious.  No reply was made to Hawk's\r\nremark, except that one man with a blackened face, and a streak of red\r\nochre down the bridge of his nose, said, \"Ho!\" and another with an\r\nequally black face, and three red streaks on each of his cheeks, said,\r\n\"Hum!\" as the war-party put on their snowshoes and prepared to start.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far when Hawk came to a sudden pause, and stood\r\ntransfixed and motionless like a dark statue.  His comrades also stopped\r\nabruptly and crouched.  No question was asked, but Hawk pointed to a\r\nspark of fire, which every Indian in the band had observed the instant\r\ntheir leader had paused.  Silently they crept forward, with guns cocked\r\nand arrows fitted to the bowstrings, until they all stood round an\r\nencampment where the fire was still smouldering, and in the centre of\r\nwhich lay a little boy and girl, fast asleep and shuddering with cold.\r\n\r\nPoor Roy and Nelly had told each other stories until their eyes would\r\nnot remain open; then they fell asleep, despite their efforts to keep\r\nawake, and, as the fire sank low, they began to shiver with the cold.\r\nLucky was it for them that the Indians discovered them, else they had\r\ncertainly been frozen to death that night.\r\n\r\nHawk roused them with little ceremony.  Roy, by an impulse which would\r\nappear to be natural to those who dwell in wild countries, whether young\r\nor old, seized his axe, which lay beside him, as he leaped up.  Hawk\r\ngrinned, and took the axe from him at once, and the poor boy, seeing\r\nthat he was surrounded by dark warriors, offered no resistance, but\r\nsought to comfort Nelly, who was clinging to him and trembling with\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nImmediately the savages sat down in the encampment, and began an earnest\r\ndiscussion, which the children watched with great eagerness.  They\r\nevidently did not agree, for much gesticulation and great vehemence\r\ncharacterised their debate.  Some pointed towards the Fort, and touched\r\ntheir tomahawks, while others pointed to the woods in the direction\r\nwhence they had come, and shook their heads.  Not a few drew their\r\nscalping knives partially from their sheaths, and, pointing to the\r\nchildren, showed clearly that they wished to cut their career short\r\nwithout delay, but several of the more sedate members of the party\r\nevidently objected to this.  Finally, Hawk turned to Roy, and said\r\nsomething to him in the Indian tongue.\r\n\r\nRoy did not understand, and attempted to say so as well as he could by\r\nsigns, and the use of the few words of the Cree language which his\r\nfather had taught him.  In the course of his speech (if we may use that\r\nterm), he chanced to mention Wapaw's name.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho! ho!\" said one and another of the Indians, while Hawk grinned\r\nhorribly.\r\n\r\nA variety of questions were now put to poor Roy, who, not understanding,\r\nof course could not answer them.  Hawk, however, repeated Wapaw's name,\r\nand pointed towards the Fort with a look of inquiry, to which Roy\r\nreplied by nodding his head and repeating \"Wapaw\" once or twice, also\r\npointing to the Fort; for he began to suspect these must be Wapaw's\r\ncomrades, who had come to search for him.  He therefore volunteered a\r\nlittle additional information by means of signs; rubbed his stomach,\r\nlooked dreadfully rueful, rolled himself as if in agony on the ground,\r\nand then, getting up, pretended to eat and look happy!  By all of which\r\nhe meant to show how that Wapaw had been on the borders of starvation,\r\nbut had been happily saved therefrom.\r\n\r\nIndians in council might teach a useful lesson to our members of\r\nparliament, for they witnessed this rather laughable species of\r\npantomime with profound gravity and silence.  When Roy concluded, they\r\nnodded their heads, and said, \"Ho! ho!\" which, no doubt, was equivalent\r\nto \"Hear hear!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a little more discussion they rose to depart, and made signs to\r\nthe children to get up and follow.  Roy then pointed out the broken\r\nstate of his snow-shoe, but this difficulty was overcome by Hawk, who\r\nthrew it away, and made him put on his sister's snow-shoes.  A stout\r\nyoung warrior was ordered to take Nelly on his back, which he did\r\nwithout delay, and the whole party left the encampment, headed by their\r\nchief.\r\n\r\nThe children submitted cheerfully at first, under the impression that\r\nthe Indians meant to convey them to the Fort.  Great, however, was their\r\nhorror when they were taken through the woods by a way which they knew\r\nto be quite in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nWhen Roy saw this he stopped and looked back, but an Indian behind him\r\ngave him a poke with the butt of his gun, which there was no resisting.\r\nFor a moment the lad thought of trying to break away, run home, and tell\r\nhis father of Nelly's fate; but a second thought convinced him that this\r\ncourse was utterly impracticable.  As for Nelly, she was too far from\r\nher brother in the procession to hold converse with him; and, as she\r\nknew not what to do, say, think, she was reduced to the miserable\r\nconsolation of bedewing with her tears the shoulders of the young\r\nwarrior who carried her.\r\n\r\nThe storm which had commenced the day before still continued, so that,\r\nin the course of a few hours, traces of the track of the war-party were\r\nalmost obliterated, and the chance of their being followed by Robin and\r\nhis friends was rendered less and less likely as time ran on.\r\n\r\nAll that day they travelled without halt, and when they stopped at night\r\nto encamp, Roy was nearly dead from exhaustion.  \"My poor Nell,\" said\r\nhe, drawing his sobbing sister close to him, as they sat near the camp\r\nfire, after having eaten the small quantity of dried venison that was\r\nthrown to them by their captors, \"don't despair; father will be sure to\r\nhunt us down, if it's in the power of man to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't despair,\" sobbed Nelly; \"but oh! what will darling mother do\r\nwhen she finds that we're lost, and I'm so afraid they'll kill us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear o' that, Nell; it's not worth their while.  Remember, too, what\r\nmother often told us--that--that--what is it she used to read so often\r\nout of the Bible?  I forget.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it was, `Call upon Me in the time of trouble, and I will\r\ndeliver thee.'  I've been thinkin' of that, Roy, already.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Nell; now, come, cheer up!  Have you had enough to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Nelly, with a loud yawn, which she did not attempt to check.\r\n\r\nRoy echoed it, as a matter of course, (who ever did see anyone yawn\r\nwithout following suit?) and then the two lay down together, spread over\r\nthemselves an old blanket which one of the Indians had given them, and\r\nfell asleep at once.\r\n\r\nDay succeeded day, night followed night, and weeks came and went, yet\r\nthe Indians continued their journey through the snow-clad wilderness.\r\nRoy's snow-shoes had been picked up and repaired by one of the savages,\r\nand Nelly was made to walk a good deal on her own snowshoes; but it is\r\njustice to the Indians to say that they slackened their pace a little\r\nfor the sake of the children, and when Nelly showed symptoms of being\r\nfatigued, the stout young warrior who originally carried her took her on\r\nhis shoulders.\r\n\r\nAt length the encampment of the tribe was reached, and Nelly was handed\r\nover to Hawk's wife to be her slave.  Soon after that, the tents were\r\nstruck, and the whole tribe went deeper into the northern wilds.\r\nSeveral gales arose and passed away, completely covering their\r\nfootprints, so that no tracks were left behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMP, THE ATTACK, AND THE ESCAPE.\r\n\r\nIt were vain to attempt a description of the varied condition of mind\r\ninto which the brother and sister fell when they found themselves\r\nactually reduced to a state of slavery in an Indian camp, and separated\r\nfrom their parents, as they firmly believed, for ever.\r\n\r\nNelly wept her eyes almost out of their sockets at first.  Then she fell\r\ninto a sort of apathetic state, in which, for several days, she went\r\nabout her duties almost mechanically, feeling as if it were all a\r\nhorrible dream, out of which she would soon awake, and find herself at\r\nhome with her \"darling mother\" beside her.  This passed, however, and\r\nshe had another fit of heart-breaking sorrow, from which she found\r\nrelief by recalling some of the passages in God's Word, which her mother\r\nhad taught her to repeat by heart; especially that verse in which it is\r\nsaid, \"that Jesus is a friend who sticketh closer than a brother.\"  And\r\nthis came to the poor child's mind with peculiar power, because her own\r\nbrother Roy was so kind, and took such pains to comfort her, and to\r\nenter into all her girlish feelings and sympathies, that she could\r\nscarcely imagine it possible for anyone to stick closer to her in all\r\nher distress than he did.\r\n\r\nAs for Roy, he was not given to the melting mood.  His nature was bold\r\nand manly.  Whatever he felt, he kept it to himself, and he forgot more\r\nthan half his own sorrow in his brotherly efforts to assuage that of\r\nNelly.\r\n\r\nBoth of them were active and willing to oblige, so that they did not\r\nallow their grief to interfere with their work, a circumstance which\r\ninduced their captors to treat them with forbearance, and even kindness.\r\nNelly sobbed and worked; gradually, the sobbing decreased, and the work\r\nwas carried on with vigour, so that she soon became quite expert at\r\nskinning rabbits, boiling meat, embroidering mocassins, smoking\r\ndeerskins, chopping firewood into small pieces, and many other details\r\nof Indian household economy; while Roy went out with the hunters, and\r\nbecame a very Nimrod, insomuch that he soon excelled all the lads of his\r\nown age, and many of those who were older, in the use of the bow, the\r\nsnow-shoes, the spear, the axe, and the gun.  But all this, and what\r\nthey did and said in the Indian camp during that winter, and what was\r\nsaid and done to them, we do not mean to write about, having matter of\r\ndeeper interest to tell.\r\n\r\nWinter passed away, and spring came.  But little do those who dwell in\r\nEngland know of the enchantment of returning spring in the frozen\r\nwilderness of North America.  The long, long winter, seems as though it\r\nwould _never_ pass away.  The intense frost seals up all the sweet\r\nodours of the woods for so many months, that the nostrils become\r\npowerfully sensitive, and, as it were, yearn for something to smell.\r\nThe skin gets so used to frost, that a balmy breeze is thought of as a\r\nthing of the past, or well-nigh forgotten.\r\n\r\nSpring in those regions comes suddenly.  It came on our wanderers with a\r\ngush.  One night the temperature rose high above the freezing point;\r\nnext day all the sights and sounds of Nature's great awakening were in\r\nfull play.  The air fanned their cheeks like a summer breeze; the\r\nstrange unwonted sound of tinkling and dropping water was heard; scents,\r\nas of green things, were met and inhaled greedily.  As the thirsty\r\nBedouin drinks from the well in the oasis, so did Roy and Nelly drink in\r\nthe delicious influences of melting nature.  And they thought of those\r\nwords which say, that the wilderness shall rejoice and blossom as the\r\nrose.  The rejoicing had commenced, the blossoming would soon follow.\r\n\r\nBut warlike and wicked men were even then preparing to desecrate the\r\nbeautiful land.  A war-party of enemies had come down upon the tribe,\r\nwith whom they dwelt.  Scouts had brought in the news.  All was\r\ncommotion and excitement in the camp.  Goods and chattels were being\r\npacked up.  The women and children were to be sent off with these, under\r\nan escort, to a place of greater security, while the Braves armed for\r\nthe fight.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of all the confusion, Roy took Nelly aside, and, with a\r\nlook of mystery, said--\r\n\r\n\"Nell, dear, I'm goin' to run away.  Stay, now, don't stare so like an\r\nowl, but hold your sweet tongue until I have explained what I mean to\r\ndo.  You and I have picked up a good deal of useful knowledge of one\r\nsort or another since we came here, and I'm inclined to think we are\r\nquite fit to take to the woods and work our way back to Fort\r\nEnterprise.\"\r\n\r\n\"But isn't it an _awful_ long way?\" said Nelly.\r\n\r\n\"It is, but we have an _awful_ long time to travel; haven't we all our\r\nlives before us?  If our lives are long, we'll manage it; if they are\r\nshort, why, we won't want to manage it, so we need not bother our heads\r\nabout that?\"\r\n\r\n\"But the way home,\" suggested Nelly, \"do you know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I know it; that is to say, I know, from that ugly thief Hawk,\r\nthat it lies somewhere or other to the south-west o' this place, some\r\nhundreds of miles off; how many hundreds does not much matter, for we\r\nhave got the whole of the spring, summer, and fall before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what if we don't get home in the fall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall spend the winter in the woods, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nNelly laughed, in spite of her anxieties, at the confident tone in which\r\nher brother spoke; and, being quite unable to argue the matter farther,\r\nshe said that she was ready to do whatever Roy pleased, having perfect\r\nconfidence in his wisdom.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Nell; now, you get ready to start at a moment's notice.\r\nWhen the Injuns attack the camp, we'll give 'em the slip.  Put all you\r\nwant to take with you on a toboggan, [see note 1] and meet me at the\r\ncrooked tree when the camp moves.\"\r\n\r\nThat night the camp was struck, and the women and children departed,\r\nunder a strong escort.  Almost at the same time the enemy came down on\r\ntheir prey, but they met men prepared for them.  In the dark, Nelly\r\ncrept to the crooked tree, dragging the toboggan after her.  She was met\r\nby Roy, who took the sledge-line and her hand and led her into the dark\r\nforest, while the savages were fighting and yelling like fiends in the\r\ncamp.  There let us leave them to fight it out.  Enough for us to know\r\nthat their warfare prevented any pursuit of the young fugitives.\r\n\r\nWeeks passed, and Roy and Nelly wandered on; all fear of pursuit soon\r\nleft them.  Ducks, geese, and other waterfowl, came in myriads with the\r\nspring.  Roy had brought with him his gun (the one he was wont to use in\r\nhunting), and bow and quiver.  They fed on the fat of the land.  Summer\r\nadvanced, and game became less plentiful; still, there was more than\r\nsufficient to supply them with abundance of food.  Autumn approached;\r\nthe wild fowl that had passed northward in spring, began to return\r\nsouthward, and again the wants of the young wanderers were\r\nsuperabundantly supplied.\r\n\r\nThe pole-star was Roy's guide.  At night he laid his course by it; and\r\nby the sun during the day, making constant allowance, of course, for the\r\nsun's rate of travelling through the sky, and taking advantage of all\r\nprominent landmarks on the way.\r\n\r\nTime sped on; many weary miles were travelled, but no sign of Fort\r\nEnterprise was to be seen.  Day after day, week after week, month after\r\nmonth they wandered, and still found themselves in the heart of an\r\nunknown wilderness.  Occasionally they observed signs of Indians, and\r\ncarefully kept out of sight at such times, as you may easily believe.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a day when hard frost set in.  It was the first touch\r\nof another winter.  Roy and Nelly did not betray their feelings to each\r\nother, but their hearts sank as they thought of what lay before them.\r\nThe frost was short-lived, however; towards noon the air became\r\ndelightfully warm, and their spirits revived.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the summit of an eminence, up which they had toiled for\r\nseveral hours, they beheld a small lake, in which the silvery clouds\r\nwere clearly reflected.  The day was calm; the sun unusually brilliant;\r\nthe autumnal foliage most gorgeous in colour.  It was like a scene in\r\nfairy-land!\r\n\r\n\"Splendid!\" exclaimed Roy, sitting down beside his sister on the trunk\r\nof a fallen tree.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! _how_ beautiful,\" cried Nelly.\r\n\r\n\"It's so like silver,\" said Roy.\r\n\r\n\"Silver Lake,\" murmured Nelly.\r\n\r\nRoy seemed to think the name appropriate, for he echoed the words, \"Yes,\r\nSilver Lake.\"  And there brother and sister sat, for a long time, on the\r\nfallen tree, in silent admiration of the scene.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNote 1.  A small Indian sledge, dragged on the snow, either by hand or\r\nby dog with loops at the sides for lashing the loading of the sledge\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE ENCAMPMENT ON SILVER LAKE.\r\n\r\nWhen Roy and Nelly sat down to gaze in admiration on Silver Lake, they\r\nlittle thought how long a period they should have to spend on its\r\nshores.\r\n\r\nThe lake was a small sheet of water not more than half a mile broad,\r\nembosomed among low hills, which, though not grand, were picturesque in\r\noutline, and wooded to their tops.  It occupied the summit of an\r\nelevated region or height-of-land--a water-shed, in fact--and Roy\r\nafterwards discovered that water flowed from both the north-east and\r\nsouth-west sides of the table-land, in the midst of which it lay.  These\r\nfountain-heads, separated by little more than half a mile from each\r\nother, were the sources of streams, which, flowing in opposite\r\ndirections through hundreds of miles of wild, beautiful, and\r\nuncultivated wilderness, found their way, on the one hand, into Hudson's\r\nBay, on the other hand, into the Atlantic through the great rivers and\r\nlakes of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the lake were strikingly clear and pellucid.  When the\r\nyoung wanderer first came upon the scene, not a zephyr stirred the\r\nleaves of the forest; the blue sky was studded with towering masses of\r\nwhite clouds which glowed in sunshine, and these reflected in the glassy\r\nwater--as if far, far down in its unfathomable depths--produced that\r\nsilvery effect which prompted Nelly to utter the name which we have\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nSmall though the Silver Lake was, it boasted two islets, which like twin\r\nbabes lay side by side on their mother's fair breast, their reflected\r\nimages stretching down into that breast as if striving to reach and\r\ngrasp its heart!\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we stay here a short time?\" asked Nelly, breaking the silence\r\nin a tone that indicated anxiety, hope, and enthusiasm, \"only for a very\r\n_little_ time,\" she added, coaxingly.\r\n\r\nRoy looked grave and sagacious.  Boys, as well as men, like to be leant\r\nupon and trusted by the fair sex--at least in things masculine--and\r\nNelly had such boundless faith in her brother's capacity to protect her\r\nand guide her through the forest, that she unwittingly inspired him with\r\nan exuberant amount of courage and self-reliance.  The lad was bold and\r\nfearless enough by nature.  His sister's confidence in him had the\r\neffect of inducing him to think himself fit for anything!  He affected,\r\ntherefore, at times, a look of grave sagacity, befitting, as he thought,\r\nso important and responsible a character.\r\n\r\n\"I've just been thinking,\" said he--\r\n\r\n\"Oh! don't _think_, but say yes!\" interrupted Nelly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm going to say yes, but I meant to give you my reasons for\r\nsayin' so.  In the first place, my powder and shot is gettin' low.  You\r\nsee I did not bring away very much from the Injun camp, and we've been\r\nusing it for so many months now that it won't last much longer, so I\r\nthink it would not be a bad plan to stop here awhile and fish and shoot\r\nand feed up--for you need rest, Nelly--and then start fresh with a\r\nwell-loaded sledge.  I'll save some powder by using the bow we made the\r\nother day.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you forget it's broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is--never mind, we can make another--there's a tree that will\r\nmake a first-rater down in the hollow, d'ye see it, Nell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where--oh yes--just by the grassy place where the rock juts out into\r\nthe water with the sun shining on it? what a _nice_ place to build a\r\nhut!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Roy, smiling at the girl's enthusiasm, \"that's the spot,\r\nand that's the very thought that jumped bang into my brain as you spoke.\r\nBy the way, does a thought jump _into_ a man's brain or _out_ of it, I\r\nwonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out of it, of course,\" cried Nelly, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure of that, Nell.  I send it rather slowly out through my\r\nmouth, but I think it jumps _into_ my brain.  I wonder how it gets in;\r\nwhether by the eyes, or ears, or mouth--perhaps it goes up the nose.\"\r\n\r\n\"What stuff you do talk!\" cried Nelly.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye think so,\" said Roy with a grin, \"well, that bein' the case, let's\r\ngo and fix our camp, for the sun is not given to sitting up all night in\r\nthese parts, so we must work while it shines.\"\r\n\r\nWith hurried steps and eager looks, (for Roy, despite his affected\r\ncoolness, was as enthusiastic about the new plan as his sister,) they\r\ndescended to the margin of Silver Lake, and began to make their\r\nencampment on the sunny spot before referred to.\r\n\r\nIt turned out to be most suitable for their purpose, having a gentle\r\nslope towards the margin of the lake, which was fringed with a beach of\r\npure white pebbles, and being well sheltered in the rear by umbrageous\r\ntrees.  The point of rocks close at hand formed a natural jetty, which,\r\nRoy observed, would be useful as a landing-place when he got his raft\r\nunder way; the turf was soft, a matter of some importance, as it was to\r\nform their couch at night, and a small stream trickled down from one of\r\nthe numerous springs which welled up at the foot of the nearest hill.\r\n\r\nSolitary and remote from the usual haunts of men as this lake was, there\r\nwas no feeling of solitude about it at the time we write of.  The entire\r\nregion was alive with wild fowl of many kinds.  Wild geese trumpeted\r\ntheir advent as they came from the far north, _en route_ for the far\r\nsouth, and settled on the bosom of Silver Lake to take a night's lodging\r\nthere.  Ducks, from the same region, and bound for the same goal--though\r\nwith less stately and regular flight--flew hither and thither with\r\nwhistling wings, ever and anon going swash into the water as a tempting\r\npatch of reeds invited them to feed, or a whim of fancy induced them to\r\nrest.  Wild swans occasionally sailed in all their majesty on its\r\nwaters, while plover of every length of limb and bill, and every species\r\nof plaintive cry, waded round its margin, or swept in clouds over the\r\nneighbouring swamps.  Sometimes deer would trot out of the woods and\r\nslake their thirst on its shore, and the frequent rings that broke its\r\nsmooth surface told of life in the watery depths below.\r\n\r\nThe whole air was filled with gushing sounds of wild melody, as though\r\nbird and beast were uniting in a hymn of praise to the beneficent\r\nCreator who had provided the means of, and given the capacity for, so\r\nmuch enjoyment.\r\n\r\nHaving decided on a suitable spot for their temporary resting-place,\r\nRoy's first care was to construct a hut.  This was neither a work of\r\ntime nor difficulty.  In a couple of hours it was finished.  He\r\ncommenced the work by felling about a dozen young fir-trees not much\r\nthicker than a man's wrist, from which he chopped the branches, thus\r\nleaving them bare poles about nine feet long.  While he was thus\r\nemployed, his sister cleared the spot on which their dwelling was to\r\nstand, and, having an eye to the picturesque, so arranged that the\r\nopening of the hut should command an uninterrupted view of the lake.  On\r\ngoing into the \"bush\" to the place where Roy was at work, she found him\r\ncutting down his sixth tree, and the ground was strewn with the flat\r\nbranches of those already cut.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, Nelly--how hot I am--carry these branches into camp, lass,\r\nan' go ahead, for I've got supper to kill yet.\"\r\n\r\nNelly made no direct reply, but muttered to herself something that\r\nsounded very like, \"Oh, what fun!\" as she filled her tiny arms with pine\r\nbranches, and, hugging them to her heaving breast, staggered to the\r\ncamp.  When she had carried all the branches, Roy had cut all the poles,\r\nso he proceeded to set them up.  Tying three poles together at the top,\r\nand using the pliant roots of a tree for the purpose, he set them up in\r\nthe form of a tripod.  Against these three all the other poles were\r\npiled, crossing each other at the top, and spreading out at the base so\r\nas to enclose a circle of about six feet in diameter.  Being numerous,\r\nthe poles were pretty close together, thus affording good support to the\r\nbranches which were afterwards piled on them.  Pine branches are flat,\r\nspreading, and thick, so that when laid above each other to a depth of\r\nseveral inches they form a very good shelter from dew and light rain.\r\nThe hut was entirely covered with such branches, which were kept in\r\ntheir places by other poles leaning upon and pressing them down.  The\r\nfloor of the hut was also covered with pine \"brush.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now for supper, Nelly,\" said Roy, seizing his bow, when the hut was\r\ncompleted, and splicing its broken part with a strip of deerskin cut\r\nfrom the lines of the sledge.\r\n\r\n\"Get a goose, Roy, and pick out a nice fat one,\" cried Nelly, laughing,\r\n\"I'll have the fire ready when you come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try,\" said Roy, and he did try, but tried in vain.  Although a\r\ngood shot, he was not sufficiently expert with the bow to shoot wild\r\nfowl on the wing, so he returned to the hut empty-handed.\r\n\r\n\"We must make a new bow, Nell,\" said he, sitting down by the fire, \"I\r\ncan do nothin' wi' this, and it won't do to use the gun for anythin' but\r\ndeer.  Meanwhile let's have the remains of our dinner for supper.  Come,\r\ncheer up, old 'ooman; we shall feast on the fat of the land to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nThe stars were shining in the sky, and winking at their reflections down\r\nin the depths of Silver Lake, and the lake itself lay, as black as ink,\r\nunder the shadow of the hills, when the brother and sister spread their\r\nblanket above them that night, and sank, almost immediately, into\r\nprofound slumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nHUNTING, AND OTHER MATTERS, ON SILVER LAKE.\r\n\r\nSunrise is a gladsome event almost at all times; we say \"almost,\"\r\nbecause there are times when sunrise is _not_ particularly gladsome.  In\r\nthe arctic regions of Norway, for instance, we have seen it rise only\r\ntwenty minutes after it set, and the rising and setting were so much\r\nmingled, that no very strong feelings of any kind were awakened.\r\nMoreover, we were somewhat depressed at the time, in consequence of\r\nhaving failed to reach those latitudes where the sun does not set at all\r\nfor several weeks in summer, but shines night and day.  To the sick,\r\nsunrise brings little comfort; too often it is watched for with\r\nweariness, and beheld, at last, with a feeling of depression at the\r\nthought that another day of pain has begun.  But to the healthy, and\r\nespecially to the young, sunrise is undoubtedly, on most occasions, a\r\ngladsome event.\r\n\r\nAt least Nelly Gore thought so when she awoke and beheld, from the floor\r\nof the hut where she lay, a flood of yellow glory gushing through a\r\nvalley, turning Silver Lake into gold, tipping the trees with fire, and\r\nblazing full in Roy's face, which was at that moment turned up to the\r\nsky with the mouth open, and the nose snoring.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _how_ beautiful!\" screamed Nelly, in the exuberance of her delight.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! murder! come on, ye black varmints,\" shouted Roy, as he sprang\r\nup and seized the axe which lay at his side.  \"Oh, it's only _you_, what\r\na yell you do give, Nelly! why, one would think you were a born Injun;\r\nwhat is't all about, lass?  Ye-a-ow! how sleepy I am--too late to have\r\nanother nap, I suppose, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, lazy thing! get up and come out quick!\" cried the other, as she\r\nsprang up and ran out of the hut to enjoy the full blaze of the\r\nsunshine, and the fresh morning air.\r\n\r\nThat morning Nelly could do little but ramble about in a wild sort of\r\nfashion, trying to imagine that she was queen of the world around her!\r\nShe sobered down, however, towards noon, and went diligently about the\r\nwork which Roy had given her to do.  She had the internal arrangements\r\nof the hut to complete and improve, some pairs of mocassins to mend, and\r\nseveral arrows to feather, besides other matters.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Roy went out to hunt.\r\n\r\nDetermined not to use his fast-diminishing ammunition, except on large\r\ngame, and anxious to become more expert with the bow, he set to work the\r\nfirst thing that day, and made a new bow.  Armed with this and a dozen\r\narrows, he sallied forth.\r\n\r\nSome of his arrows were pointed with ivory, some with iron, and some had\r\nno points at all, but blunt heavy heads instead.  These latter were, and\r\nstill are, used by Indians in shooting game that is tame and easily\r\nkilled.  Grouse of various kinds, for instance, if hit with full force\r\nfrom a short range by a blunt-headed arrow, will be effectually stunned,\r\nespecially if hit on the head.\r\n\r\nAt first Roy walked along the shores of the lake, but was not very\r\nsuccessful, because the ducks and geese were hid among reeds, and rose\r\nsuddenly with a distracting _whirr_, usually flying off over the water.\r\nTo have let fly at these would have cost him an arrow every shot, so,\r\nafter losing one, he wisely restrained himself.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, he turned into the woods, resolving to try his fortune\r\nwhere his arrows were not so likely to be lost.  He had not gone far,\r\nwhen a tree-grouse sprang into the air and settled on a neighbouring\r\npine.\r\n\r\nRoy became excited, for he was anxious not to return to the hut\r\nempty-handed a second time.  He fitted a sharp-headed arrow to the\r\nstring, and advanced towards the bird cautiously.  His anxiety to make\r\nlittle noise was so great, that he tripped over a root and fell with a\r\nhideous crash into the middle of a dead bush, the branches of which\r\nsnapped like a discharge of little crackers.  Poor Roy got up disgusted,\r\nbut on looking up found that the grouse was still sitting there, filled\r\napparently with more curiosity than alarm.  Seeing this he advanced to\r\nwithin a few yards of the bird, and, substituting a blunt arrow for the\r\nsharp one, discharged it with vigour.  It hit the grouse on the left\r\neye, and brought it to the ground like a stone.\r\n\r\n\"Good, that's `number one,'\" muttered the lad as he fastened the bird to\r\nhis belt; \"hope `number two' is not far off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Number two\" was nearer than he imagined, for four other birds of the\r\nsame kind rose a few yards ahead of him, with all the noise and flurry\r\nthat is characteristic of the species.\r\n\r\nThey settled on a tree not far off, and looked about them.\r\n\r\n\"Sit there, my fine fellows, till I come up,\" muttered Roy.  (The lad\r\nhad a habit of speaking to himself while out hunting.)\r\n\r\nThey obeyed the order, and sat until he was close to them.  Again was\r\nthe blunt arrow fitted to the string; once more it sped true to its\r\nmark, and \"number two\" fell fluttering to the ground.\r\n\r\nNow, the grouse of North America is sometimes a very stupid creature.\r\nIt literally sits still to be shot, if the hunter is only careful to\r\nfire first at the lowest bird of the group.  If he were to fire at the\r\ntopmost one, its fluttering down amongst the others would start them\r\noff.\r\n\r\nRoy was aware of this fact, and had aimed at the bird that sat lowest on\r\nthe tree.  Another arrow was discharged, and \"number three\" lay\r\nsprawling on the ground.  The blunt arrows being exhausted, he now tried\r\na sharp one, but missed.  The birds stretched their necks, turned their\r\nheads on one side, and looked at the lad, as though to say, \"It won't\r\ndo,--try again!\"\r\n\r\nAnother shaft was more successful.  It pierced the heart of \"number\r\nfour,\" and brought it down like a lump of lead.  \"Number five\" seemed a\r\nlittle perplexed by this time, and made a motion as though it were about\r\nto fly off, but an arrow caught it in the throat, and cut short its\r\nintentions and its career.  Thus did Roy bag, or rather belt, five birds\r\nconsecutively.  [See note one.]\r\n\r\nOur hero was not one of those civilised sportsmen who slaughter as much\r\ngame as they can.  He merely wanted to provide food for a day or two.\r\nHe therefore turned his steps homeward--if we may be allowed the\r\nexpression--being anxious to assist his sister in making the hut\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAs he walked along, his active mind ran riot in many eccentric channels.\r\nThose who take any interest in the study of mind, know that it is not\r\nonly the mind of a romantic boy that does this, but that the mind of man\r\ngenerally is, when left to itself, the veriest acrobat, the most\r\nunaccountable harlequin, that ever leaped across the stage of fancy.\r\n\r\nRoy's mind was now in the clouds, now on the earth.  Anon it was away in\r\nthe far-off wilderness, or scampering through the settlements, and\r\npresently it was deep down in Silver Lake playing with the fish.  Roy\r\nhimself muttered a word or so, now and then, as he walked along, which\r\ngave indication of the whereabouts of his mind at the time.\r\n\r\n\"Capital fun,\" said he, \"only it won't do to stay too long.  Poor\r\nmother, how she'll be wearin' for us!  Hallo! ducks, you're noisy coons,\r\nwonder why you get up with such a bang.  Bang! that reminds me of the\r\ngun.  No more banging of you, old chap, if my hand keeps in so well with\r\nthe bow.  Eh! duck, what's wrong?\"\r\n\r\nThis latter question was addressed to a small duck which seemed in an\r\nanxious state of mind, to judge from its motions.  Presently a head, as\r\nif of a fish, broke the surface of the lake, and the duck disappeared!\r\n\r\n\"Oh the villain,\" exclaimed Roy, \"a fish has bolted him!\"\r\n\r\nAfter this the lad walked on in silence, looking at the ground, and\r\nevidently pondering deeply.\r\n\r\n\"Nelly,\" said he, entering the hut and throwing the grouse at her feet,\r\n\"here is dinner, supper, and breakfast for you, and please get the first\r\nready as fast as you can, for I'm famishing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how nice! how did you get them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you presently, but my head's full of a notion about catching\r\nducks just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Catching ducks, Roy, what is the notion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Nelly, I han't scratched it out o' my brain yet, but I'll\r\ntell 'ee after dinner, and we'll try the plan to-morrow mornin'.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNote 1.  The author has himself, in the backwoods, taken four birds in\r\nsuccession off a tree in this fashion with a fowling-piece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nFISHING EXTRAORDINARY.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning, Roy and Nelly rose to try the new style\r\nof duck-hunting which the former had devised.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if it will do,\" said the little girl, as she tripped along by\r\nher brother's side in the direction of a marshy bay, which had been\r\nselected as the scene of their experiments.  \"How clever of you to\r\ninvent such a funny plan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I didn't exactly invent it, lass.  The fact is, that I remembered\r\nfather havin' told me he had read it in a book before he left the\r\nsettlements.  I _wish_ we had some books.  Pity that we've got no\r\nbooks.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" assented Nell, with a touch of sadness in her tone.\r\n\r\nBoth Roy and his sister were good readers, having been taught by their\r\nmother out of the Bible--the only book that Robin Gore had brought with\r\nhim from the settlements.  Robin could read, but he did not care much\r\nfor reading--neither did Walter nor Larry O'Dowd.  Indeed the latter\r\ncould not read at all.  Mrs Gore had wanted to take a few books with\r\nher into the wilderness, but her husband said he thought the Bible was\r\nenough for her; so the library at Fort Enterprise was select and small!\r\nOne good resulted from this--the Bible was read, by all who could read,\r\na great deal more than would have been the case had there been other\r\nbooks at hand.  But the young people longed earnestly for books\r\ncontaining fairy tales, such as was told to them by their mother; and\r\nwild adventures, such as Walter could relate or invent by the hour.\r\n\r\nIt might have been observed that Roy carried on his shoulder a\r\nremarkable object--something like a clumsy basket made of reeds, and\r\nabout twice the size of a man's head.  This had been made by Nelly the\r\nnight before.  The use to which it was to be put was soon shown by Roy.\r\nHaving reached the spot where the experiment was to be tried, and having\r\nobserved that there were many ducks, large and small, floating about\r\namong the reeds, he got Nelly to hold the basket, if we may so call it,\r\nas high as she could raise it.  There was a hole in the bottom of it.\r\nThrough this Roy thrust his head, so that the machine rested on his\r\nshoulders, his head being inside and completely concealed.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Nelly, what think you of my helmet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! it is splendid!\" cried the girl, laughing in a subdued voice.\r\n\"It's so awfully absurd looking, but can you see? for I don't see a bit\r\nof your face.\"\r\n\r\n\"See? ay, as well as need be.  There's lots of small holes which I can\r\npeep through in all directions.  But come, I'll try it.  Keep close,\r\nNell, and don't laugh too loud, for ducks ain't used to laughing, d'ye\r\nsee, and may be frightened by it.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying Roy crept on his hands and knees to the edge of the lake,\r\nbeing concealed by bushes, until he got into the water.  Here a few\r\nsteps took him into the reeds which clustered so thickly at that spot,\r\nand grew so tall that he was soon hidden from sight altogether.\r\n\r\nHe had not taken off much of his dress, which, we may remark in passing,\r\nwas of the simplest at all times--consisting of a pair of trousers, a\r\nstriped cotton shirt, and a grey cloth capote with a hood to it.  His\r\ncapote and cap were left in charge of his sister.  As for the shirt and\r\ntrousers, they could be easily dried again.\r\n\r\nNelly watched the place where her brother had disappeared with\r\nbreathless interest.  As he did not reappear as quickly as she had\r\nexpected, she became greatly alarmed.  In a few minutes more she would\r\ncertainly have rushed into the lake to the rescue, regardless of\r\nconsequences and of ducks, had not Roy's strange head-dress come\r\nsuddenly into view at the outward verge of the reeds.  The lad had waded\r\nin up to his neck, and was now slowly--almost imperceptibly--approaching\r\na group of ducks that were disporting themselves gaily in the water.\r\n\r\n\"They'll never let him near them,\" thought Nelly.\r\n\r\nShe was wrong, for at that moment an extremely fat and pert young duck\r\nobserved the bundle of reeds, and swam straight up to it, animated, no\r\ndoubt, by that reckless curiosity which is peculiar to young creatures.\r\nHad its mother known what was inside of the bundle, she would no doubt\r\nhave remonstrated with her head-strong child, but, old and sagacious\r\nthough that mother was, she was completely deceived.  She was not even\r\nastonished when her duckling suddenly disappeared beneath the water,\r\nthinking, no doubt, that it had dived.  Soon the bundle of reeds drew\r\nnear to the mother, and she, too, disappeared suddenly below the water.\r\nWhatever her astonishment was at feeling her legs seized from below, she\r\nhad not time to express it before her voice was choked.  Nelly observed\r\nthese disappearances with intense amazement, and delight stamped every\r\nlineament of her little visage.\r\n\r\nWhen the bundle moved towards the father of the duck-family, that\r\ngentleman became agitated and suspicious.  Probably males are less\r\ntrusting than females, in all conditions of animal life.  At all events\r\nhe sheered off.  The bundle waxed impatient and made a rush at him.  The\r\ndrake, missing his wife and child, quacked the alarm.  The bundle made\r\nanother rush, and suddenly disappeared with a tremendous splash, in the\r\nmidst of which a leg and an arm appeared!  Away went the whole brood of\r\nducks with immense splutter, and Nelly gave a wild scream of terror,\r\nsupposing--and she was right--that her brother had fallen into a hole,\r\nand that he would be drowned.  In the latter supposition, however, she\r\nwas mistaken, for Roy swam ashore in a few moments with a duck in each\r\nhand!\r\n\r\n\"O Roy! ain't you cold?\" inquired Nelly, as she helped him to squeeze\r\nthe water out of his garments.\r\n\r\n\"Y-y-ye-es,\" said Roy, trembling in every limb, while his teeth rattled\r\nlike small castanets, \"I'm very c-c-c-cold, but I'm in luck, for I've\r\ng-g-g-got to-night's s-s-s-supper, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nThis was true, but as he could not hope to procure many more suppers in\r\nthe same fashion at that season of the year, he and his sister went off\r\nwithout delay to try the fishing.\r\n\r\nThey had brought a fishing-line and a few hooks, among other small\r\nthings, from the Indian camp.  This line was now got out, overhauled,\r\nand baited with a bit of the young duck's breast.  From the end of the\r\npoint of rocks, which had been named the Wharf, the line was cast, for\r\nthere the lake was deep.\r\n\r\n\"Take the end of the line, Nell; I want you to catch the first fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"How d'ye know we shall catch--oh! oh--ooh!\"  The fish in Silver Lake\r\nhad never seen a bait or felt a hook in their lives before that day.\r\nThey actually fought for the prize.  A big bully--as is usually the case\r\nin other spheres of life--gained it, and found he had \"caught a Tartar.\"\r\nHe nearly pulled Nelly into the lake, but Roy sprang to the rescue, and\r\nbefore the child's shout of surprise had ceased to echo among the\r\ncliffs, a beautiful silvery fish, about a foot and a half long, lay\r\ntumbling on the strand.\r\n\r\n\"Hurray!\" cried Roy.  \"Try again.\"\r\n\r\nThey did try again, and again, and over again, until they had caught two\r\ndozen and a half of those peculiar \"white-fish\" which swarm in most of\r\nthe lakes of North America.  Then they stopped, being somewhat\r\nexhausted, and having more than enough for present use.\r\n\r\nBefore sitting down to supper that night, they preserved their fish in\r\nthe simple but effective manner which is practised among the fur-traders\r\nin cold weather, and which they had learned while with the Indians.\r\nEach fish was split open and cleaned out, and then hung up by the tail\r\nto dry.\r\n\r\n\"What a jolly time we shall have of it!\" said Roy, with his mouth full,\r\nas he sat beside Nelly and toasted his toes that night at supper.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Nelly--\"if--if we were only a _little_ nearer home.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply made them both silent and sad for a time.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" resumed Roy, cheerily, as he began another white-fish--\r\nhaving already finished one fish and the duckling--\"cheer up, Nell,\r\nwe'll stay here long enough to get up a stock o' dried meat, and then\r\nset off again.  I only wish it would come frost, to make our fish keep.\"\r\n\r\nRoy's wish was gratified sooner than he expected, and much more fully\r\nthan he desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nCHANGES, SLIDING, FISHING, ETCETERA.\r\n\r\nThat night King Frost spread his wings over the land with unwonted\r\nsuddenness and rigour, insomuch that a sheet of ice, full an inch thick,\r\nsealed up the waters of Silver Lake.\r\n\r\nRoy and Nelly had feasted heartily, and had piled wood on the fire so\r\nhigh that the hut was comparatively warm, and they slept soundly till\r\nmorning: but, about sunrise, the fire having died out, they both awoke\r\nshivering with cold.  Being _very_ sleepy, they tried for some time to\r\ndrop off again in spite of the cold.  Failing in this, Roy at last\r\njumped up with vigour and said he would light the fire, but he had\r\nscarcely issued from the hut, when a shout brought Nelly in alarm and\r\nhaste to his side.\r\n\r\nIf Silver Lake was worthy of its name before, it was infinitely more\r\nworthy of it now.  The sun had just over-topped the opposite ridge, and\r\nwas streaming over a very world of silver.  The frozen lake was like a\r\nsheet of the purest glass, which reflected the silvery clouds and white\r\nrolling mists of morning as perfectly in their form as the realities\r\nthat floated in the blue sky.  Every tree, every twig, seemed made of\r\nsilver, being encased in hoar-frost, and as these moved very gently in\r\nthe calm air--for there was no breeze--millions of crystalline points\r\ncaught the sun's rays and scattered them around with dazzling lustre.\r\nNature seemed robed in cloth of diamonds; but the comparison is feeble,\r\nfor what diamonds, cut by man, can equal those countless crystal gems\r\nthat are fashioned by the hand of God to decorate, for an hour or two,\r\nthe spotless robe of a winter morning?\r\n\r\nHad Roy been a man and Nelly a woman, the two would probably have cast\r\naround a lingering glance of admiration, and then gone quietly about\r\ntheir avocations; but, being children, they made up their minds, on the\r\nspot, to enjoy the state of things to the utmost.  They ran down to the\r\nlake and tried the ice.  Finding that it was strong enough to bear them,\r\nthey advanced cautiously out upon its glassy surface; then they tried to\r\nslide, but did not succeed well, owing to their soft mocassins being ill\r\nadapted for sliding.  Then they picked up stones, and tried how far they\r\ncould make them skim out on the lake.\r\n\r\n\"How I wish we could slide!\" exclaimed Nelly, pausing in the midst of\r\nher amusement.\r\n\r\nRoy also paused, and appeared to meditate for a minute.\r\n\r\n\"So you shall,\" said he quickly.  \"Come and let us breakfast, and I'll\r\nmake you a pair of sliders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sliders! what are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall see; get breakfast ready, a man's fit for nothing without\r\ngrub.\"\r\n\r\nWhile breakfast was preparing, Roy began to fashion wooden soles for his\r\nsister's feet and his own.  These he fixed on by means of strips of\r\ndeerskin, which were sunk into grooves in the under part of the soles to\r\nprevent them from chafing.  Rough and ready they were, nevertheless they\r\nfitted well and tightly to their feet; but it was found that the want of\r\na joint at the instep rendered it difficult to walk with these soles on,\r\nand impossible to run.  Roy's ingenuity, however, soon overcame this\r\ndifficulty.  He cut the soles through just under the instep, and then,\r\nboring two holes in each part, lashed them firmly together with\r\ndeerskin, thus producing a joint or hinge.  Eager to try this new\r\ninvention, he fastened on his own \"sliders\" first, and, running down to\r\nthe lake, made a rush at the ice and sent himself off with all his\r\nforce.  Never was boy more taken by surprise; he went skimming over the\r\nsurface like a stone from a sling.  The other side of the lake seemed to\r\nbe the only termination of his journey.  \"What if it should not be\r\nbearing in the middle!\"  His delight was evinced by a cheer.  It was\r\nechoed, with the addition of a laugh by Nell, who stood in rapt\r\nadmiration on the shore.  Roy began well, with his legs far apart and\r\nhis arms in the air; then he turned round and advanced the wrong way,\r\nthen he staggered--tried to recover himself; failed, shouted, cheered\r\nagain, and fell flat on his back, and performed the remainder of the\r\njourney in that position!\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent slide, and was repeated and continued, with every\r\npossible and conceivable modification, for full two hours, at the end of\r\nwhich time Nelly said she couldn't take another slide to save her life,\r\nand Roy felt as if every bone in his body were going out of joint.\r\n\r\n\"This is all very well,\" said Roy, as they went up to the hut together,\r\n\"but it won't do much in the way of getting us a supply of meat or\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" assented Nelly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" continued Roy, \"we'll rest a bit, and then set to work.\r\nIt's quite plain that we can have no more wading after ducks, but the\r\nfish won't object to feed in cold weather, so we'll try them again after\r\nhaving had a bit to eat.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this plan the two went to the wharf, after having\r\nrefreshed themselves, and set to work with the fishing-line.  Nelly\r\nbaited the hook, and Roy cut a hole in the ice with his axe.  Having put\r\nin the hook, and let it down to the bottom, they stood at the edge of\r\nthe hole--expectant!\r\n\r\n\"Frost seems to spoil their appetite,\" said Roy, in a tone of\r\ndisappointment, after about five minutes had elapsed.\r\n\r\nA fish seemed to have been listening, for before Nelly could reply,\r\nthere came a violent tug at the line.  Roy returned a still more violent\r\ntug, and, instead of hauling it up hand over hand, ran swiftly along the\r\nice, drawing the line after him, until the fish came out of the hole\r\nwith a flop and a severe splutter.  It was above four pounds weight, and\r\nthey afterwards found that the deeper the water into which the line was\r\ncast the larger were the fish procured.  White-fish were the kind they\r\ncaught most of, but there were a species of trout, much resembling a\r\nsalmon in colour and flavour, of which they caught a good many above ten\r\nand even fifteen pounds weight.  All these fish, except those reserved\r\nfor immediate use, they cleaned and hung up in the manner already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThus they occupied themselves for several days, and as the work was\r\nhard, they did not wander much from their hut, but ate their meals with\r\nappetite, and slept at nights soundly.\r\n\r\nOne night, just as they were about to lay down to rest, Roy went out to\r\nfetch an armful of firewood.  He returned with a look of satisfaction on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Nell, what call ye that?\" pointing to a few specks of white\r\non his breast and arms.\r\n\r\n\"Snow!\" exclaimed Nelly.\r\n\r\n\"Ay--snow! it's come at last, and I am glad of it, for we have far more\r\nthan enough o' grub now, and it's time we were off from this.  You see,\r\nlass, we can't expect to find much game on a journey in winter, so we\r\nmust carry all we can with us.  Our backs won't take so much as the\r\nsled, but the sled can't go loaded till there's snow on the ground, so\r\nthe moment there is enough of it we'll set off.  Before starting,\r\nhows'ever, I must go off and try for a deer, for men can't walk well on\r\nfish alone; and when I'm away you can be getting the snow-shoes\r\nrepaired, and the sled-lashings overhauled.  We will set about all that\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"But isn't to-morrow Sabbath?\" said Nelly.\r\n\r\n\"So 'tis!  I forgot; well, we can put it off till Monday.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to remark that Mrs Gore, being a sincere Christian,\r\nhad a great reverence for the Sabbath-day, and had imbued her children\r\nwith some of her own spirit in regard to it.\r\n\r\nDuring the troubles and anxieties of the period when the children were\r\nlost in the snow and captured by the Indians, they had lost count of the\r\ndays of the week.  Roy was not much troubled about this, but his\r\nsister's tender conscience caused her much uneasiness; and when they\r\nafterwards ran away from the Indians, and could do as they pleased, they\r\nagreed together to fix a Sabbath-day for themselves, beginning with the\r\nparticular day on which it first occurred to them that they had not kept\r\na Sabbath \"for a long, long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't find out the right day now, you know,\" observed Nelly, in an\r\napologetic tone.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" said Roy; \"besides, it don't matter, because you\r\nremember how it is in the Ten Commandments: `Six days shalt thou labour\r\nand do all thy work, but the _seventh_ day is the Sabbath.'  We will\r\nkeep _to-day_, then; work _six_ days, and then keep the _seventh_ day.\"\r\n\r\nWe have elsewhere observed that Roy was a bit of a philosopher.  Having\r\nreasoned the matter out thus philosophically, the children held to their\r\nresolve; they travelled six days, and observed every seventh day as the\r\nSabbath.\r\n\r\nThe particular Sabbath-day about which we are writing turned out to be a\r\nmemorable one, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nRoy and Nelly lay down that night, side by side, as was their wont, with\r\ntheir separate blankets wrapped around them, and their feet pointing\r\ntowards the fire.  Of course they never undressed at night on this\r\njourney, but washed their underclothing as they found time and\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nSoon they were sound asleep, and their gentle breathing was the only\r\nsound that broke the stillness of the night.  But snow was falling\r\nsilently in thick heavy flakes, and it soon lay deep on the bosom of\r\nSilver Lake.  Towards morning the wind arose, and snow-drift began to\r\nwhirl round the hut, and block up its low doorway.\r\n\r\nStill the brother and sister slumbered peacefully, undisturbed by the\r\ngathering storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nA CHANGE IN THE WEATHER--RABBITS AND BEARS APPEAR.\r\n\r\n\"Hi!  Hallo!  I say, Nelly, what's all this?\"  There was good cause for\r\nthe tone of surprise in which Roy uttered these words when he awoke, for\r\nthe fireplace and the lower half of his own, as well as his sister's,\r\nblanket were covered with at least half a foot of snow.  It had found\r\nits way in at the hole in the roof of the hut, and the wind had blown a\r\ngreat deal through the crevices of the doorway, so that a snow-wreath\r\nmore than a foot high lay close to Nelly's elbow.\r\n\r\nThis was bad enough, but what made it worse was that a perfect hurricane\r\nwas blowing outside.  Fortunately the hut was sheltered by the woods,\r\nand by a high cliff on the windward side; but this cliff, although it\r\nbroke the force of the gale, occasioned an eddy which sent fearful gusts\r\nand thick clouds of snow ever and anon full against the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"O Roy! what shall we do?\" said Nelly, in an anxious tone.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know,\" said Roy, jumping up and tightening his belt; \"you never\r\ncan know what's got to be done till you've took an observation o' what's\r\ngoin' on, as daddy used to say.  Hallo! hold on.  I say, if it goes on\r\nlike this it'll blow the hut down.  Come, Nelly, don't whimper; it's\r\nonly a puff, after all, an' if it did capsize us, it wouldn't be the\r\nfirst time we had a tumble in the snow.  Seems to me that we're goin' to\r\nhave a stormy Sabbath, though.  Rouse up, lass, and while you're\r\nclearin' off the snow, I'll go get a bundle o' sticks, and light the\r\nfire.\"\r\n\r\nRoy stooped to pass under the low doorway, or, rather, hole of the hut,\r\nand bending his head to the blast passed out; while Nelly, whose heart\r\nwas cheered by her brother's confident tone more than by his words, set\r\nabout shovelling away the snow-drift with great activity.\r\n\r\nPresently Roy returned, staggering under a heavy load of firewood.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!  Nell,\" he cried, flinging down the wood with a clatter, \"just you\r\ncome an' see Silver Lake.  Such a sight it is you never saw; but come\r\nslick off--never mind your belt; just roll your blanket round you, over\r\nhead and ears--there,\" said he, assisting to fasten the rough garment,\r\nand seizing his sister's hand, \"hold on tight by me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _what_ a storm!\" gasped the little girl, as she staggered out and\r\ncame within the full force of the gale.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a storm, such as would have appalled the hearts of\r\nyoungsters less accustomed to the woods than were our hero and heroine.\r\nBut Roy and Nelly had been born and bred in the midst of stormy\r\nbackwoods' elements, and were not easily alarmed, chiefly because they\r\nhad become accustomed to estimate correctly the extent of most of the\r\ndangers that menaced them from time to time.  A gale of the fiercest\r\nkind was blowing.  In its passage it bent the trees until they groaned\r\nand creaked again; it tore off the smaller twigs and whisked them up\r\ninto the air; it lifted the snow in masses out of the open spots in the\r\nwoods, and hurled them in cloud-like volumes everywhere; and it roared\r\nand shrieked through the valleys and round the mountain tops as if a\r\nthousand evil spirits were let loose upon the scene.\r\n\r\nSilver Lake was still silvery in its aspect, for the white drift was\r\nflying across it like the waves of a raging sea; but here, being\r\nexposed, the turmoil was so tremendous that there was no distinguishing\r\nbetween earth, lake, and sky.  \"Confusion, worse confounded\" reigned\r\nevery where, or rather, appeared to reign; for, in point of fact, _there\r\nis no confusion whatever_ in the works and ways of God.  Common sense,\r\nif unfallen, would tell us that.  The Word reveals it, and science of\r\nlate years has added its testimony thereto.\r\n\r\nRoy and Nelly very naturally came to the conclusion that things were in\r\na very disordered state indeed on that Sabbath morning, so they returned\r\nto their hut, to spend the day as best they might.\r\n\r\nTheir first care was to kindle the fire and prepare breakfast.  While\r\nNelly was engaged in this, Roy went out and cut several small trees,\r\nwith which he propped the hut all round to prevent it from being blown\r\ndown.  But it was discovered, first, that the fire would hardly kindle,\r\nand, second, that when it was kindled it filled the whole place with\r\nsmoke.  By dint of perseverance, however, breakfast was cooked and\r\ndevoured, after which the fire was allowed to go out, as the smoke had\r\nalmost blinded them.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Nell, cheer up,\" said Roy, on concluding breakfast; \"we'll\r\nrig up a tent to keep the snow off us.\"\r\n\r\nThe snow, be it understood, had been falling into the fire, and, more or\r\nless, upon themselves, through the hole in the roof; so they made a tent\r\ninside the hut, by erecting two posts with a ridge-pole at a height of\r\nthree feet from the ground, over which they spread one of their\r\nblankets.  Under this tent they reclined with the other blankets spread\r\nover them, and chatted comfortably during the greater part of that day.\r\n\r\nOf course their talk was chiefly of home, and of the mother who had been\r\nthe sun and the joy of their existence up to that sad day when they were\r\nlost in the snow, and naturally they conversed of the Bible, and the\r\nhymns which their mother had made the chief objects of their\r\ncontemplation on the Sabbaths they had spent at Fort Enterprise.\r\n\r\nMonday was as bad as Sunday in regard to weather, but Tuesday dawned\r\nbright and calm, so that our wanderers were enabled to resume their\r\navocations.  The snow-shoes were put in order, the sled was overhauled\r\nand mended, and more fish were caught and hung up to dry.  In the\r\nevening Roy loaded his gun with ball, put on his snow-shoes, and sallied\r\nforth alone to search for deer.  He carried with him several small\r\npieces of line wherewith to make rabbit snares; for, the moment the snow\r\nfell, innumerable tracks revealed the fact that there were thousands of\r\nrabbits in that region.  Nelly, meanwhile, busied herself in putting the\r\nhut in order, and in repairing the mocassins which would be required for\r\nthe journey home.\r\n\r\nLest any reader should wonder where our heroine found materials for all\r\nthe mending and repairing referred to, we may remark that the Indians in\r\nthe wilderness were, and still are, supplied with needles, beads, cloth,\r\npowder and shot, guns, axes, etcetera, etcetera, by the adventurous\r\nfur-traders, who penetrate deep and far into the wilderness of North\r\nAmerica; and when Nelly and Roy ran away from their captors they took\r\ncare to carry with them an ample supply of such things as they might\r\nrequire in their flight.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile from the hut Roy set several snares.  He had often\r\nhelped his father in such work, and knew exactly how to do it.\r\nSelecting a rabbit-track at a spot where it passed between two bushes,\r\nhe set his snare so that it presented a loop in the centre of the path.\r\nThis loop was fastened to the bough of a tree bent downwards, and so\r\narranged that it held fast to a root in the ground; when a rabbit should\r\nendeavour to leap or force through it, he would necessarily pull away\r\nthe fastening that held it down, and the bough would spring up and lift\r\nthe hapless creature by the neck off the ground.\r\n\r\nHaving set half-a-dozen such snares, Roy continued his march in search\r\nof deer-tracks.  He was unsuccessful, but to his surprise he came\r\nsuddenly on the huge track of a bear!  Being early in the season this\r\nparticular bruin had not yet settled himself into his winter quarters,\r\nso Roy determined to make a trap for him.  He had not much hope of\r\ncatching him, but resolved to try, and not to tell Nelly of his\r\ndiscovery until he should see the result.\r\n\r\nAgainst the face of a cliff he raised several huge stones so as to form\r\na sort of box, or cave, or hole, the front of which was open, the sides\r\nbeing the stones referred to, and the back the cliff.  Then he felled a\r\ntree as thick as his waist, which stood close by, and so managed that it\r\nfell near to his trap.  By great exertions, and with the aid of a wooden\r\nlever prepared on the spot, he rolled this tree--when denuded of its\r\nbranches--close to the mouth of the trap.  Next he cut three small\r\npieces of stick in such a form that they made a trigger--something like\r\nthe figure 4--on which the tree might rest.  On the top of this trigger\r\nhe raised the tree-stem, and on the end of the trigger, which projected\r\ninto the trap, he stuck a piece of dried fish, so that when the bear\r\nshould creep under the stem and touch the bait, it would disarrange the\r\ntrigger, set it off, and the heavy stem would fall on bruin's back.  As\r\nhe knew, however, that bears were very strong, he cut several other\r\nthick stems, and piled them on the first to give it additional weight.\r\n\r\nAll being ready, and the evening far advanced, he returned to the hut to\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nROY'S DREAM.\r\n\r\n\"Nelly, ye-a-a-ow!\" exclaimed Roy, yawning as he awoke on the following\r\nmorning from a dream, in which bears figured largely; \"what a night I've\r\nhad of it, to be sure--fightin' like a mad buffalo with--\" Here Roy\r\npaused abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what were you fighting with?\" asked Nell, with a smile that ended\r\nin a yawn.\r\n\r\n\"I won't tell you just now, lass, as it might spoil your appetite for\r\nbreakfast.  Set about getting that ready as fast as you can, for I want\r\nto be off as soon as possible to visit my snares.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess we shall have rabbits for dinner to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with the sled?\" inquired Nelly, observing that\r\nher brother was overhauling the lashings and drag-rope.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I set a lot o' snares, an' there's no sayin' how many rabbits may\r\nhave got into 'em.  Besides, if the rabbits in them parts are\r\ntender-hearted, a lot o' their relations may have died o' grief, so I\r\nshall take the sled to fetch 'em all home!\"\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Roy loaded his gun with ball, and putting on his\r\nsnow-shoes, sallied forth with an admonition to his sister to \"have a\r\nroarin' fire ready to cook a rare feast!\"\r\n\r\nNelly laughingly replied, that she would, and so they parted.\r\n\r\nThe first part of Roy's journey that day led him through a\r\nthickly-wooded part of the country.  He went along with the quick, yet\r\ncautious and noiseless, step of a hunter accustomed to the woods from\r\ninfancy.  His thoughts were busy within him, and far away from the scene\r\nin which he moved; yet, such is the force of habit, he never for a\r\nmoment ceased to cast quick, inquiring glances on each side as he went\r\nalong.  Nothing escaped his observation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I could only get a deer this day,\" thought he, \"how scrumptious\r\nit would be!\"\r\n\r\nWhat he meant by \"scrumptious\" is best known to himself, but at that\r\nmoment a large deer suddenly--perhaps scrumptiously!--appeared on the\r\nbrow of a ridge not fifty yards in advance of him.  They had been both\r\nwalking towards each other all that forenoon.  Roy, having no powers of\r\nscent beyond human powers, did not know the fact, and as the wind was\r\nblowing from the deer to the hunter, the former--gifted though he was\r\nwith scenting powers--was also ignorant of the approaching meeting.\r\n\r\nOne instant the startled deer stood in bewildered surprise.  One instant\r\nRoy paused in mute amazement.  The next instant the deer wheeled round,\r\nwhile Roy's gun leaped to his shoulder.  There was a loud report,\r\nfollowed by reverberating echoes among the hills, and the deer lay dead\r\non the snow.\r\n\r\nThe young hunter could not repress a shout of joy, for he not only had\r\nsecured a noble stag, but he had now a sufficiency of food to enable him\r\nto resume his homeward journey.\r\n\r\nHis first impulse was to run back to the hut with the deer's tongue and\r\na few choice bits, to tell Nelly of his good fortune; but, on second\r\nthoughts, he resolved to complete the business on which he had started.\r\nLeaving the deer where it fell he went on, and found that the snares had\r\nbeen very successful.  Some, indeed, had been broken by the strength of\r\nthe boughs to which they had been fastened, and others remained as he\r\nhad set them; but above two-thirds of them had each a rabbit hung up by\r\nthe neck, so that the sled was pretty well loaded when all the snares\r\nhad been visited.\r\n\r\nHe had by this time approached the spot where the bear-trap was set, and\r\nnaturally began to grow a little anxious, for, although his chance of\r\nsuccess was very slight, his good fortune that morning had made him more\r\nsanguine than usual.\r\n\r\nThere is a proverb which asserts that \"it never rains but it pours.\"  It\r\nwould seem to be a common experience of mankind that pieces of good\r\nfortune, as well as misfortunes, come not singly.  Whether the proverb\r\nbe true or no, this experience was realised by Roy on that day, for he\r\nactually did find a bear in his trap!  Moreover it was alive, and,\r\napparently, had only just been caught, for it struggled to free itself\r\nwith a degree of ferocity that was terrible to witness.\r\n\r\nIt was an ordinary black bear of considerable size and immense strength.\r\nHeavy and thick though the trees were that lay on its back and crushed\r\nit to the earth, it caused them to shake, leap, and quiver as though\r\nthey had been endowed with life.  Roy was greatly alarmed, for he\r\nperceived that at each successive struggle the brute was ridding itself\r\nof the superincumbent load, while fierce growls and short gasps\r\nindicated at once the wrath and the agony by which it was convulsed.\r\n\r\nRoy had neglected to reload his piece after shooting the deer--a most\r\nun-hunter-like error, which was the result of excitement.  Thinking that\r\nhe had not time to load, he acted now on the first suggestion of his\r\nbold spirit.  Resting his gun against a tree, he drew the small axe that\r\nhung at his belt and attacked the bear.\r\n\r\nThe first blow was well delivered, and sank deep into bruin's skull; but\r\nthat skull was thick, and the brain was not reached.  A roar and a\r\nfurious struggle caused Roy to deliver his second blow with less effect,\r\nbut this partial failure caused his pugnacity to rise, and he\r\nimmediately rained down blows on the head and neck of the bear so fast\r\nand furious that the snow was speedily covered with blood.  In\r\nproportion as Roy strove to end the conflict by vigorous and quick\r\nblows, the bear tried to get free by furious efforts.  He shook the\r\ntree-stem that held him down so violently that one of the other trees\r\nthat rested on it fell off, and thus the load was lightened.  Roy\r\nobserved this, and made a desperate effort to split the bear's skull.\r\nIn his haste he misdirected the blow, which fell not on the head but on\r\nthe neck, in which the iron head of the axe was instantly buried--a main\r\nartery was severed, and a fountain of blood sprang forth.  This was\r\nfortunate, for the bear's strength was quickly exhausted, and, in less\r\nthan two minutes after, it sank dead upon the snow.\r\n\r\nRoy sat down to rest and wipe the blood from his hands and garments, and\r\nthen, cutting off the claws of the animal as a trophy, he left it there\r\nfor a time.  Having now far more than it was possible for him to drag to\r\nthe hut, he resolved to proceed thither with the rabbits, and bring\r\nNelly back to help him to drag home the deer.\r\n\r\n\"Well done, Roy,\" cried Nelly, clapping her hands, when her brother\r\napproached with the sled-load of rabbits, \"but you are covered with\r\nblood.  Have you cut yourself?\"\r\n\r\nShe became nervously anxious, for she well knew that a bad cut on a\r\njourney costs many a man his life, as it not only disables from\r\ncontinuing the journey but from hunting for provisions.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Nell, but I've killed a deer--and--and--something else!\r\nCome, lass, get on your snow-shoes and follow me.  We'll drag home the\r\ndeer, and then see what is to be done with the--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _what_ is it? do tell!\" cried Nell, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, it's a bear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!--tell me true, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the truth, Nell, as you shall see, and here are the claws.  Look\r\nsharp, now, and let's off.\"\r\n\r\nAway went these two through the snow, until they came to where the deer\r\nhad been left.  It was hard work to get it lashed on the sled, and much\r\nharder work to drag it over the snow, but by dint of perseverance and\r\nresolution they got it home.  They were so fatigued, however, that it\r\nwas impossible to think of doing the same with the bear.  This was a\r\nperplexing state of things, for Roy had observed a wolf-track when out,\r\nand feared that nothing but the bones would be left in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"What _is_ to be done?\" said Nelly, with that pretty air of utter\r\nhelplessness which she was wont to assume when she felt that her brother\r\nwas the proper person to decide.\r\n\r\nRoy pondered a few moments, and then said abruptly, \"Camp-out, Nelly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Camp-out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, beside the bear--keep it company all night with a big fire to scare\r\naway the wolves.  We'll put everything into the hut, block up the door,\r\nand kindle a huge fire outside that will burn nearly all night.  So now,\r\nlet's go about it at once.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Nelly did not much relish the idea of leaving their comfortable\r\nhut, and going out to encamp in the snow beside the carcase of a dead\r\nbear, she was so accustomed to regard her brother's plans as perfect,\r\nand to obey him promptly, that she at once began to assist in the\r\nnecessary preparations.  Having secured everything safely in the hut,\r\nand kindled a fire near it, which was large enough to have roasted an\r\nox, they set off for the bear-trap, and reached it in time to scare away\r\na large wolf which was just going to begin his supper on bruin.\r\n\r\nAn encampment was then made in the usual way, close to the bear-trap, a\r\nfire as large as could be conveniently made was kindled, and the brother\r\nand sister wrapped themselves in their blankets and lay comfortably down\r\nbeside it to spend the night there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\n\"SHOOSKIN'.\"\r\n\r\nNext day Roy and Nelly rose with the sun, and spent the forenoon in\r\nskinning and cutting up the bear, for they intended to dry part of the\r\nmeat, and use it on their journey.  The afternoon was spent in dragging\r\nthe various parts to the hut.  In the evening Roy proposed that they\r\nshould go and have a shoosk.  Nelly agreed, so they sallied forth to a\r\nneighbouring slope with their sledge.\r\n\r\nShoosking, good reader, is a game which is played not only by children\r\nbut by men and women; it is also played in various parts of the world,\r\nsuch as Canada and Russia, and goes by various names; but we shall adopt\r\nthe name used by _our_ hero and heroine, namely \"shoosking.\"  It is very\r\nsimple, but uncommonly violent, and consists in hauling a sledge to the\r\ntop of a snow-hill or slope, getting upon it, and sliding down to the\r\nbottom.  Of course, the extent of violence depends on the steepness of\r\nthe slope, the interruptions that occur in it, and the nature of the\r\nground at the bottom.  We once shoosked with an Indian down a\r\nwood-cutter's track, on the side of a steep hill, which had a sharp turn\r\nin it, with a pile of firewood at the turn, and a hole in the snow at\r\nthe bottom, in which were a number of old empty casks.  Our great\r\ndifficulties in this place were to take the turn without grazing the\r\nfirewood, and to stop our sledges before reaching the hole.  We each had\r\nseparate sledges.  For some time we got on famously, but at last _we_\r\nran into the pile of firewood, and tore all the buttons off our coat,\r\nand the Indian went down into the hole with a hideous crash among the\r\nempty casks; yet, strange to say, neither of us came by any serious\r\ndamage!\r\n\r\n\"There's a splendid slope,\" said Roy, as they walked briskly along the\r\nshores of Silver Lake, dragging the sledge after them, \"just beyond the\r\nbig cliff, but I'm afraid it's too much for _you_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _I_ can go if you can,\" said Nell, promptly.\r\n\r\n\"You've a good opinion of yourself.  I guess I could make you sing small\r\nif I were to try.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then don't try,\" said Nelly, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" continued Roy, \"there's the slope; you see it is very steep; we'd\r\ngo down it like a streak of greased lightnin'; but I don't like to try\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?  It seems easy enough to me.  I'm sure we have gone down as\r\nsteep places before at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, lass, but not with a round-backed drift like that at the bottom.\r\nIt has got such a curve that I think it would make us fly right up into\r\nthe air.\"\r\n\r\nNelly admitted that it looked dangerous, but suggested that they might\r\nmake a trial.\r\n\r\n\"Well, so we will, but I'll go down by myself first,\" said Roy,\r\narranging the sledge at the summit of a slope, which was full fifty feet\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, pick up the bits tenderly, Nell, if I'm knocked to pieces;\r\nhere goes, hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nRoy had seated himself on the sledge, with his feet resting on the head\r\nof it, and holding on to the side-lines with both hands firmly.  He\r\npushed off as he cheered, and the next moment was flying down the hill\r\nat railway speed, with a cloud of snow-drift rolling like steam behind\r\nhim.  He reached the foot, and the impetus sent him up and over the\r\nsnow-drift or wave, and far out upon the surface of the lake.  It is\r\ntrue he made one or two violent swerves in this wild descent, owing to\r\ninequalities in the hill, but by a touch of his hands in the snow on\r\neither side, he guided the sledge, as with a rudder, and reached the\r\nfoot in safety.\r\n\r\n\"May I venture, Roy?\" inquired Nell, eagerly, as the lad came panting up\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\n\"Venture!  Of course.  I rose off the top o' the drift only a little\r\nbit, hardly felt the crack at all; come, get you on in front, and I'll\r\nsit at yer back an' steer.\"\r\n\r\nNelly needed no second bidding.  She sat down and seized the side-lines\r\nof the sledge, with a look of what we may call wild expectation; Roy sat\r\ndown behind her.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lass, steady, and away we go!\"\r\n\r\nAt the last word they shot from the hill-top like an arrow from a bow.\r\nThe cloud of snow behind them rolled thicker, for the sledge was more\r\nheavily laden than before.  Owing to the same cause it plunged into the\r\nhollow at the foot of the hill with greater violence, and shot up the\r\nslope of the snow-drift and over its crest with such force that it\r\nsprung horizontally forward for a few feet in the air, and came to the\r\nground with a crash that extracted a loud gasp from Roy, and a sharp\r\nsqueak from Nelly.  It was found to be so delightful, however, that they\r\ntried it again and again, each time becoming more expert, and therefore\r\nmore confident.\r\n\r\nExcessive confidence, however, frequently engenders carelessness.  Roy\r\nsoon became reckless; Nelly waxed fearless.  The result was that the\r\nformer steered somewhat wildly, and finally upset.\r\n\r\nTheir last \"shoosk\" that evening was undertaken just as the sun's latest\r\nrays were shooting between the hills on the opposite side of Silver\r\nLake, and casting a crimson glow on the hut and the surrounding scenery.\r\nRoy had fixed a snow-shoe on the outer ridge of the snow-drift, to mark\r\nthe distance of their last leap from its crest, and had given the sledge\r\nan extra push on the way down to increase its impetus.  This extra push\r\ndisconcerted him in steering; he reached the hollow in a side-long\r\nfashion, shot up the slope of the drift waveringly, and left its crest\r\nwith a swing that not only turned the sledge right round, but also\r\nupside down.  Of course they were both thrown off, and all three fell\r\ninto the snow in a condition of dire confusion.  Fortunately, no damage\r\nwas done beyond the shock and the fright, but this accident was\r\nsufficient to calm their spirits, and incline them to go home to supper.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's great fun, no doubt, but we must turn our minds to more\r\nearnest work, for our journey lies before us,\" said Roy, with the\r\ngravity of an Iroquois warrior, as he sat beside the fire that night\r\ndiscussing a bear-steak with his sister.  \"We have more than enough of\r\nfish and meat, you see; a day or two will do to turn our deer and bear\r\ninto dried meat; the snow-shoes are mended, the sledge is in good order,\r\nas to-night's work has proved, and all that we've got to do is to start\r\nfresh with true bearin's and--hey! for home!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I was there,\" said Nelly, laying down a marrow-bone with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Wishin' ain't enough, Nell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that, an' I'm ready to work,\" said Nelly, resuming the bone with\r\na resolute air.  \"When shall we set out?\"\r\n\r\n\"When we are ready, lass.  We shall begin to dry the meat to-morrow, an'\r\nas soon as it's fixed--off we'll start.  I only hope the cold weather\r\nwill last, for if it came warm it would go hard with your little feet,\r\nNell.  But let's turn in now.  Hard work requires a good sleep, an' it\r\nmay be that we've harder work than we think before us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY HOME RESUMED AND INTERRUPTED.\r\n\r\nThree days more and our young friends bade farewell to Silver Lake.\r\n\r\nShort though their stay had been, it had proved very pleasant, for it\r\nwas full of energetic labour and active preparation, besides a great\r\ndeal of amusement, so that quite a home feeling had been aroused in\r\ntheir minds, and their regret at leaving was considerable.\r\n\r\nBut after the first few miles of their journey had been accomplished,\r\nthe feeling of sadness with which they set out wore away, and hopeful\r\nanticipations of being home again in a few weeks rendered them cheerful,\r\nand enabled them to proceed with vigour.  The weather at starting was\r\nfine, too, so that the night encampments in the snow were comparatively\r\nagreeable, and the progress made during the first few days was\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nAfter this, however, the good fortune of our adventurers seemed to\r\ndesert them.  First of all one of Nelly's snow-shoes broke down.  This\r\nnecessitated a halt of half a day, in order to have it repaired.  Then\r\none of Roy's snow-shoes gave way, which caused another halt.  After this\r\na heavy snow-storm set in, rendering the walking very difficult, as they\r\nsank, snow-shoes and all, nearly to the knees at each step.  A storm of\r\nwind which arose about the same time, effectually stopped their farther\r\nadvance, and obliged them to take to the shelter of a dense part of the\r\nwoods and encamp.\r\n\r\nDuring three days and three nights the hurricane raged, and the snow was\r\nblown up in the air and whirled about like the foam of the roaring sea;\r\nbut our wanderers did not feel its effects much, for they had chosen a\r\nvery sheltered spot at the foot of a large pine, which grew in a hollow,\r\nwhere a cliff on one side and a bluff of wood on the other rendered the\r\nblast powerless.  Its fierce howling could be heard, however, if not\r\nfelt; and as the brother and sister lay at the bottom of their hole in\r\nthe snow, with their toes to the comfortable fire, they chatted much\r\nmore cheerily than might have been expected in the midst of such a\r\nscene, and gazed upward from time to time with comparative indifference\r\nat the dark clouds and snow-drifts that were rushing madly overhead.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day the gale subsided almost as quickly as it had arisen,\r\nand Roy announced that it was his intention to start.  In a few minutes\r\neverything was packed up and ready.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Nell,\" said Roy, just as they were about to leave the camp,\r\n\"don't the sled look smaller than it used to?\"\r\n\r\n\"So it does, Roy; but I suppose it's because we have eaten so much\r\nduring the last three days.\"\r\n\r\nRoy shook his head, and looked carefully round the hole they were about\r\nto quit.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know, lass; it seems to me as if somethin' was a-wantin'.  Did ye\r\npack your own bundle very tight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I think I did it tighter than usual, but I'm not very sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum--that's it, no doubt--we've packed the sled tighter, and eaten it\r\ndown.  Well, let's off now.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Roy threw the lines of the sledge over his shoulder and led\r\nthe way, followed by his sister, whose only burden was a light blanket,\r\nfastened as a bundle to her shoulders, and a small tin can, which hung\r\nat her belt.\r\n\r\nThe country through which they passed that day was almost destitute of\r\nwood, being a series of undulating plains, with clumps of willows and\r\nstunted trees scattered over it like islets in the sea.  The land lay in\r\na succession of ridges, or steppes, which descended from the elevated\r\nregion they were leaving, and many parts of these ridges terminated\r\nabruptly in sheer precipices from forty to sixty feet high.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone with dazzling brilliancy, insomuch that the travellers'\r\neyes became slightly affected by snow-blindness.  This temporary\r\nblindness is very common in these regions, and ranges from the point of\r\nslight dazzlement to that of total blindness; fortunately it is curable\r\nby the removal of the cause--the bright light of the sun on pure snow.\r\nEsquimaux use \"goggles\" or spectacles made of wood, with a narrow slit\r\nin them as a preventive of snow-blindness.\r\n\r\nAt first neither Roy nor Nelly felt much inconvenience, but towards\r\nevening they could not see as distinctly as usual.  One consequence of\r\nthis was, that they approached a precipice without seeing it.  The snow\r\non its crest was so like to the plain of snow extending far below, that\r\nit might have deceived one whose eyesight was not in any degree\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation they had of their danger was the giving way of the\r\nsnow that projected over the edge of the precipice.  Roy fell over\r\nheadlong, dragging the sledge with him.  Nelly, who was a few feet\r\nbehind him, stood on the extreme edge of the precipice, with the points\r\nof her snow-shoes projecting over it.  Roy uttered a cry as he fell, and\r\nhis sister stopped short.  A shock of terror blanched her cheek and\r\ncaused her heart to stand still.  She could not move or cry for a few\r\nseconds, then she uttered a loud shriek and shrank backwards.\r\n\r\nThere chanced to be a stout bush or tree growing on the face of the\r\ncliff, not ten feet below the spot where the snow-wreath had broken off.\r\nRoy caught at this convulsively, and held on.  Fortunately the line on\r\nhis shoulder broke, and the sledge fell into the abyss below.  Had this\r\nnot happened, it is probable that he would have been dragged from his\r\nhold of the bush.  As it was, he maintained his hold, and hung for a few\r\nseconds suspended in the air.  Nelly's shriek revived him from the gush\r\nof deadly terror that seized him when he fell.  He grasped the boughs\r\nabove him, and was quickly in a position of comparative security among\r\nthe branches of the bush.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Nell,\" he gasped, on hearing her repeat her cry of despair.\r\n\"I'm holdin' on quite safe.  Keep back from the edge, lass--there's no\r\nfear o' me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure, Roy?\" cried Nelly, trembling very much, as she stretched\r\nforward to try to catch sight of her brother.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, quite sure; but I can't get up, for there's six feet o' smooth rock\r\nabove me, an' nothin' to climb up by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! what _shall_ I do!\" cried Nelly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't get flurried--that's the main thing, lass.  Let me think--ay,\r\nthat's it--you've got your belt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, take it off and drop the end over to me; but lie down on your\r\nbreast, and be careful.\"\r\n\r\nNelly obeyed, and in a few seconds the end of the worsted belt that\r\nusually encircled her waist was dangling almost within reach of her\r\nbrother.  This belt was above five feet long.  Roy wore one of similar\r\nmaterial and length.  He untied it, and then sought to lay hold of the\r\nother.  With some difficulty, and much risk of falling, he succeeded,\r\nand fastened his own belt to it firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Nell, haul up a little bit--hold! enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"What am I to do now?\" asked Nell, piteously; \"I cannot pull you up, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not; but take your snow-shoe and dig down to the rocks--\r\nyou'll find somethin', I dare say, to tie the belts to.  Cheer up, lass,\r\nand go at it.\"\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, the active little girl soon cleared away the snow until\r\nshe reached the ground, where she found several roots of shrubs that\r\nseemed quite strong enough for her purpose.  To one of these she tied\r\nthe end of her belt, and Roy, being an athletic lad, hauled himself up,\r\nhand over hand, until he gained a place of safety.\r\n\r\n\"But the sledge is gone,\" cried Nelly, pausing suddenly in the midst of\r\nher congratulations.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, and the grub,\" said Roy, with a blank look.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed too true, and on examination it was found that things\r\nwere even worse than had been anticipated, for the sledge had fallen on\r\na ledge, half way down the precipice, that was absolutely inaccessible\r\neither from above or below.  An hour was spent in ascertaining this,\r\nbeyond all doubt, and then Roy determined to return at once to their\r\nlast encampment to gather the scraps they had thrown away or left behind\r\nas useless.\r\n\r\nThat night they went supperless to rest.  Next morning, they set out\r\nwith heavy hearts for the encampment of the previous day.  On reaching\r\nit, and searching carefully, they found that one of the bundles of dry\r\nmeat had been forgotten.  This accounted for the lightness of the\r\nsledge, and, at the same time, revived their drooping spirits.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done now?\" inquired Nelly.\r\n\r\n\"Return to Silver Lake,\" said Roy, promptly.  \"We must go back, fish and\r\nhunt again until we have another supply o' grub, and then begin our\r\njourney once more.\"\r\n\r\nSadly and slowly they retraced their steps.  Do what he would Roy could\r\nnot cheer up his sister's spirits.  She felt that her back was turned\r\ntowards her father's house--her mother's home--and every step took her\r\nfarther from it.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely evening, about sunset, when they reached Silver Lake,\r\nand found the hut as they had left it, and enough of old scraps of\r\nprovisions to afford a sufficient meal.\r\n\r\nThat night they ate their supper in a more cheerful frame of mind.  Next\r\nday they breakfasted almost with a feeling of heartiness, and when they\r\nwent out to resume their fishing, and to set snares and make traps, the\r\nold feeling of hopefulness returned.  Ere long, hope became again so\r\nstrong in their ardent young hearts, that they laughed and talked and\r\nsported as they had done during the period of their first residence\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAt first they were so anxious to make up the lost quantity of food that\r\nthey did little else but fish, hunt, and dry their provisions when\r\nobtained; but after a few days they had procured such an ample supply\r\nthat they took to shoosking again--having succeeded in making a new\r\nsledge.  But a thaw came suddenly and spoiled all their fish.  A wolf\r\ncarried off the greater part of their dried meat one day while they were\r\nabsent from the hut.  After this the frost set in with extreme violence,\r\ngame became more scarce, and fish did not take the bait so readily, so\r\nthat, although they procured more than enough for present consumption,\r\nthey were slow in accumulating a travelling store; and thus it came to\r\npass that November found Roy and Nelly still toiling wearily, yet\r\nhopefully, on the shores of Silver Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE MASSACRE.\r\n\r\nWe must return now to Robin Gore and his wife, who, on the morning on\r\nwhich we re-introduce them to the reader, were standing in the trading\r\nstore of Fort Enterprise, conversing earnestly with Black, the Indian,\r\nwho has been already mentioned at the beginning of our tale.  The wife\r\nof the latter--the White Swan--was busily engaged in counting over the\r\npack of furs that lay open on the counter, absorbed, apparently, in an\r\nabstruse calculation as to how many yards of cloth and strings of beads\r\nthey would purchase.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm glad that's fixed, anyhow,\" said Robin to his wife, as he\r\nturned to the Indian with a satisfied air, and addressed him in his\r\nnative tongue, \"it's a bargain, then, that you an' Slugs go with me on\r\nthis expedition, is't so?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Black Swan is ready,\" replied the Indian, quietly, \"and he thinks\r\nthat Slugs will go too--but the white hunter is self-willed; he has a\r\nmouth--ask himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ye don't like to answer for him,\" said Robin, with a smile;\r\n\"assuredly Slugs has his own notions, and holds to 'em; but I'll ask\r\nhim.  He is to be here this night, with a deer, I hope, for there are\r\nmany mouths to fill.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Swan, who was a tall, taciturn, and powerful Indian, here glanced\r\nat his wife, who was, like most Indian women, a humble-looking and not\r\nvery pretty or clean creature.  Turning again to Robin, he said, in a\r\nlow, soft voice--\r\n\r\n\"The White Swan is not strong, and she is not used to be alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand you,\" said Robin; \"she shall come to the Fort, and be\r\nlooked after.  You won't object to take her in, Molly, when we're away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Object, Robin,\" said Molly, with a smile, which was accompanied by a\r\nsigh, \"I'll only be too glad to have her company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, that's settled; and now, Black Swan, I may as well tell you\r\nwhat coorse I mean to follow out in this sarch for my child'n.  You know\r\nalready that four white men--strangers--have come to the Fort, an' are\r\nnow smokin' their pipes in the hall, but you don't know that one on 'em\r\nis my own brother Jefferson; Jeff, I've bin used to call him.  Jeff's\r\nbin a harem-scarem feller all his life--active and able enough, an' good\r\nnatur'd too, but he never could stick to nothin', an' so he's bin\r\nwanderin' about the world till grey hairs have begun to show on him,\r\nwithout gettin' a home or a wife.  The last thing he tried was stokin' a\r\nsteamboat on the Mississippi; but the boat blew up, pitched a lot o' the\r\npassengers into the water, an' the rest o' them into the next world.\r\nJeff was always in luck with his life; he's lost everythin' over an'\r\nover again but that.  He was one o' the lot as was blowed into the\r\nwater, so, when he come up he swamed ashore, an' come straight away here\r\nto visit me, bringin' three o' the blowed-up passengers with him.  The\r\nthree are somethin' like himself; good for nothin'; an' I'd rather have\r\ntheir room than their company at most times.  Hows'ever, just at this\r\ntime I'm very glad they've come, for I'll leave them in charge o' the\r\nFort, and set off to look for the child'n in two days from this.  I'll\r\ntake Walter and Larry wi' me, for brother Jeff is able enough to manage\r\nthe trade if redskins come; he can fight too, if need be.  The Gore\r\nfamily could always do that, so ye needn't be afraid, Molly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll not be afraid, Robin, but I'll be anxious about ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's nat'ral, lass, but it can't be helped.  Well, then,\" continued\r\nRobin, \"the five of us will start for the Black Hills.  I've bin told by\r\na redskin who comed here last week that he an' his tribe had had a\r\nscrimmage with Hawk an' the reptiles that follow him.  He says that\r\nthere was a white boy an' a white girl with Hawk's party, an' from his\r\naccount of 'em I'm sartin sure it's my Roy and Nelly.  God help 'em!\r\n`but,' says he, `they made their escape durin' the attack, an' we\r\nfollowed our enemies so far that we didn't think it worth while to\r\nreturn to look for 'em, so I'm convinced they made for the Black Hills,\r\nnigh which Hawk was attacked, an' if we follow 'em up there we may find\r\n'em alive yet, mayhap.'\"\r\n\r\nPoor Robin's voice became deeper and less animated as he spoke, and the\r\nlast word was uttered with hesitation and in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"O Robin, Robin!\" exclaimed Mrs Gore, throwing her arms suddenly round\r\nher husband's neck, and hiding her sobbing face in his breast, \"d'ye\r\nthink they can _still_ be alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Molly,\" said Robin, commanding his feelings with a great effort,\r\n\"han't ye often read to me that wi' God all things is possible?\"\r\n\r\nThe poor woman thanked God in her heart, for up to that day Robin had\r\nnever once quoted Scripture in his efforts to comfort her.\r\n\r\n\"Was Wapaw with Hawk when they were attacked?\" inquired the Black Swan.\r\n\r\n\"Wapaw is dead,\" said a deep voice, as the huge form of a western hunter\r\ndarkened the little doorway, and the next moment Slugs strode into the\r\nstore, and quietly seated himself on the counter.\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" exclaimed Robin, as he shook the hunter's proffered hand.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, dead!  Have ye no word of welcome for a chum after a month's\r\nabsence?\" said Slugs, holding out his horny hand to the Black Swan, who\r\ngravely grasped and shook it.\r\n\r\n\"You redskins are a queer lot,\" said Slugs, with a grin, \"yer as stiff\r\nas a rifle ramrod to look at, but there's warm and good stuff in 'ee for\r\nall that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about Wapaw?\" inquired Mrs Gore, anxiously; \"surely he's not\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he's not dead he's not livin', for I saw Hawk himself, not four\r\nweeks ago, shoot him and follow him up with his tomahawk, and then heard\r\ntheir shout as they killed him.  Where did he say he was goin' when he\r\nleft you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said he would go down to the settlements to see the missionaries,\r\nan' that he thought o' lookin' in on the fur-traders that set up a fort\r\nlast year, fifty miles to the south'ard o' this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, just so,\" said Slugs; \"I was puzzled to know what he was doin'\r\nthereaway, and that explains it.  He's dead now, an' so are the\r\nfur-traders he went to see.  I'll tell ye all about it if you'll give me\r\nbaccy enough to fill my pipe.  I ran out o't three days agone, an' ha'\r\nbin smokin' tea-leaves an' bark, an' all sorts o' trash.  Thank 'ee;\r\nthat's a scent more sweet nor roses.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this the stout hunter cut up the piece of tobacco which Robin\r\nat once handed to him, and rolled it with great zest between his palms.\r\nWhen the pipe was filled and properly lighted, he leaned his back\r\nagainst an unopened bale of goods that lay on the counter, and drawing\r\nseveral whiffs, began his narrative.\r\n\r\n\"You must know that I made tracks for the noo fur-tradin' post when I\r\nleft you, Black Swan, about a month ago.  I hadn't much of a object; it\r\nwas mainly cooriosity as took me there.  I got there all right, an' was\r\nsittin' in the hall chattin' wi' the head man--Macdonell they called\r\nhim--about the trade and the Injuns.  Macdonell's two little child'n was\r\nplayin' about, a boy an' a girl, as lively as kittens, an' his wife--a\r\ngood-lookin' young 'ooman--was lookin' arter 'em, when the door opens,\r\nand in stalks a long-legged Injun.  It was Wapaw.  Down he sat in front\r\no' the fireplace, an' after some palaver an' a pipe--for your Injuns'll\r\nnever tell all they've got to say at once--he tells Macdonell that there\r\nwas a dark plot hatchin' agin' him--that Hawk, a big rascal of his own\r\ntribe, had worked upon a lot o' reptiles like hisself, an' they had made\r\nup their minds to come an' massacre everybody at the Fort, and carry off\r\nthe goods.\r\n\r\n\"At first Macdonell didn't seem to believe the Injun, but when I told\r\nhim I knowed him, an' that he was a trustworthy man, he was much\r\ntroubled, an' in doubt what to do.  Now, it's quite clear to me that\r\nHawk must have somehow found out or suspected that Wapaw was goin' to\r\n'peach on him, an' that he had followed his trail close up; for in less\r\nthan an hour arter Wapaw arrived, an' while we was yet sittin' smokin'\r\nby the fire, there was a most tremendous yell outside.  I know'd it for\r\nthe war-whoop o' the redskins, so I jumped up an' cocked my rifle.  The\r\nothers jumped up too, like lightnin'; an' Mrs Macdonell she got hold o'\r\nher girlie in her arms an' was runnin' across the hall to her own room,\r\nwhen the door was knocked off its hinges, and fell flat on the floor.\r\nBefore it had well-nigh fallen I got sight o' somethin', an' let drive.\r\nThe yell that follered told me I had spoilt somebody's aim.  A volley\r\nwas poured on us next moment, an' a redskin jumped in, but Wapaw's\r\ntomahawk sent him out again with a split skull.  Before they could\r\nreload--for the stupid fools had all fired together--I had the door up,\r\nand a heavy table shoved agin it.  Then I turned round, to load agin;\r\nwhile I was doin' this, I observed poor Macdonell on his knees beside\r\nhis wife, so I went to them an' found that the wife an' girl were stone\r\ndead--both shot through the heart with the same ball.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as Macdonell saw this he rose up quietly, but with a look on\r\nhis face sich as I never see in a man 'xcept when he means to stick at\r\nnothin'.  He got hold of his double-barrelled gun, an' stuck a scalpin'\r\nknife an' an axe in his belt.\r\n\r\n\"`Git on my back, Tommy,' says he to his little boy, who was cryin' in a\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy got up at once, an' jumped on his dad's back.  All this time the\r\nredskins were yellin' round the house like fiends, an' batterin' the\r\ndoor, so that it was clear it couldn't stand long.\r\n\r\n\"`Friends,' said he turnin' to me an' Wapaw, an' a poor terrified chap\r\nthat was the only one o' his men as chanced to be in the house at the\r\ntime, `friends, it's every man for himself now; I'll cut my way though\r\nthem, or--'.  He stopped short, an' took hold o' his axe in one hand,\r\nan' his gun in the other.  `Are ye ready?' says he.  We threw forward\r\nour rifles an' cocked 'em; Macdonell--he was a big, strong man--suddenly\r\nupset the table; the savages dashed in the door with sich force that\r\nthree or four o' 'em fell sprawlin' on the floor.  We jumped over these\r\nbefore they could rise, and fired a volley, which sent three or four o'\r\nthe reptiles behind on their backs.  We got into the bush without a\r\nscratch, an' used our legs well, I can tell 'ee.  They fired a volley\r\nafter us, which missed us all except poor Tommy.  A bullet entered his\r\nbrain, an' killed him dead.  For some time his father would not drop\r\nhim, though I told him he was quite dead; but his weight kept him from\r\nrunnin' fast, an' we heard the redskins gainin' on us, so at last\r\nMacdonell put the boy down tenderly under a bush.  Me and Wapaw stopped\r\nto fire an' keep the reptiles back, but they fired on us, and Wapaw\r\nfell.  I tried to lift him, but he struggled out o' my arms.  Poor\r\nfellow! he was a brave man; and I've no doubt did it a-purpose, knowin'\r\nthat I couldn't run fast enough with him.  Just then I saw Hawk come\r\njumpin' and yellin' at us, followed by two or three dozen redskins, all\r\nflourishin' their tomahawks.  Macdonell and me turned to die fightin'\r\nalongside o' our red comrade, but Wapaw suddenly sprang up, uttered a\r\nshout of defiance, an' dashed into the bush.  The Injuns were after him\r\nin a moment, and before we could get near them a yell of triumph told us\r\nthat it was too late, so we turned and bolted in different directions.\r\n\r\n\"I soon left them behind me, but I hung about the place for a day or two\r\nto see if Macdonell should turn up, or any of his men.  I even went back\r\nto the Fort after the reptiles had left it.  They had burned it down,\r\nan' I saw parts o' the limbs o' the poor wife and child lyin' among the\r\nhalf-burned goods that they weren't able to carry away with them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nVENGEANCE.\r\n\r\nThe terrible tale which was related by Slugs had the effect of changing\r\nRobin Gore's plans.  He resolved to pursue the murderers, and inflict\r\nsummary punishment on them before setting off on the contemplated search\r\nfor his lost children, and he was all the more induced to do this that\r\nthere was some hope he might be able to obtain a clue to their\r\nwhereabouts from some of the prisoners whom he hoped to seize.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought by some a rash step for him to take--the pursuit of\r\na band of about fifty savages with a party of six men.  But backwood\r\nhunters were bold fellows in those days, and Indians were by no means\r\nnoted for reckless courage.  Six stout, resolute, and well-armed men\r\nwere, in Robin's opinion, quite a match for fifty redskins!\r\n\r\nHe could not muster more than six, because it was absolutely necessary\r\nto leave at least three men to guard Fort Enterprise.  Robin therefore\r\nresolved to leave his brother Jeff to look after it, with two of the\r\nstrangers; and Jeff accepted the charge with pleasure, saying he \"would\r\ndefend the place agin a hundred red reptiles.\"  The third stranger--a\r\nman named Stiff--he resolved to take with him.\r\n\r\nThe war-party, when mustered, consisted of Robin Gore, his nephew\r\nWalter, Larry O'Dowd, the Black Swan, Slugs the hunter, and Stiff the\r\nstranger.  Armed to the teeth, these six put on their snow-shoes the\r\nfollowing morning, and set forth on their journey in silence.\r\n\r\nNow this change of plans was--all unknown to Robin--the means of leading\r\nhim towards, instead of away from, his lost little ones.  For Roy and\r\nNelly had travelled so far during their long wanderings from the Black\r\nHills--the place where they escaped from the Indians--that they were at\r\nthat time many long miles away from them in another direction.  In fact,\r\nif Robin had carried out his original plan of search, he would have been\r\nincreasing the distance between himself and his children every step he\r\ntook!\r\n\r\nNot knowing this, however, and being under the impression that each\r\nday's march lessened his chance of ultimately finding his lost ones, he\r\nwalked along, mile after mile, and day after day, in stern silence.\r\n\r\nOn the third day out, towards evening, the party descried a thin line of\r\nblue smoke rising above the tree-tops.  They had reached an elevated and\r\nsomewhat hilly region, so that the ground favoured their approach by\r\nstealth, nevertheless, fearing to lose their prey, they resolved to wait\r\ntill dark, and take their enemies, if such they should turn out to be,\r\nby surprise.\r\n\r\nSoon after sunset Robin gave the word to advance.  Each man of the party\r\nlaid aside his blanket, and left his provisions, etcetera, in the\r\nencampment, taking with him his arms only.\r\n\r\n\"I need not say that there must be no speaking, and that we must tread\r\nlightly.  You're up to redskin ways as well as me, except mayhap our\r\nfriend Stiff here.\"\r\n\r\nStiff who was a tall Yankee, protested that he could \"chaw up his\r\ntongue, and go as slick as a feline mouser.\"\r\n\r\nOn nearing the fire, they made a _detour_ to examine the tracks that led\r\nto it, and found from their number and other signs that it was indeed\r\nHawk's party.\r\n\r\nRobin advanced alone to reconnoitre.  On returning, he said--\r\n\r\n\"It's just the reptiles; there's forty of 'em if there's one, an'\r\nthey've got a white man bound with 'em; no doubt from what you said of\r\nhim, Slugs, it's Macdonell; but I don't see Wapaw.  I fear me that his\r\ndays are over.  Now, then, lads, here's our plan: we'll attack them from\r\nsix different points at once.  We'll all give the war-whoop at the same\r\nmoment, takin' the word from Walter there, who's got a loud pipe of his\r\nown, then when the varmints start to their feet--for I don't like the\r\nnotion o' firin' at men off their guard--Walter, Larry, an' Stiff will\r\nfire.  Black Swan, Slugs, an' I will reserve our fire while you reload;\r\nthe reptiles will scatter, of course, an' we'll give 'em a volley an' a\r\nunited yell as they cut stick, that'll keep 'em from waitin' for more.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan thus hastily sketched was at once carried out.  Advancing\r\nstealthily to their several stations, the six men, as it were,\r\nsurrounded the savages, who, not dreaming of pursuit, had neglected to\r\nplace sentinels round the camp.  When Walter's loud \"halloo!\" rang in\r\ntheir ears, the whole band sprang to their feet, and seized their arms,\r\nbut three shots laid three of them dead on the ground.  As they fled\r\nright and left the reserve fired, and shot three others, among whom was\r\nHawk himself.  Black Swan had picked him out, and shot him through the\r\nhead.  Before they were quite out of shot, the three who had first fired\r\nhad reloaded and fired again with some effect, for blood was afterwards\r\nobserved on the snow.\r\n\r\nSlugs now made a rush into the camp to unbind Macdonell, but to his\r\nhorror he discovered that a knife was plunged up to the handle in his\r\nbreast, and that he was almost dead.  Hawk had evidently committed this\r\ncowardly deed on the first alarm, for the knife was known to be his.\r\nMacdonell tried hard to speak, but all that he was able to say was,\r\n\"Wapaw, wounded, escaped--follow.\"  Then his head fell back, and he\r\ndied.  From the few words thus uttered, however, the pursuers concluded\r\nthat Wapaw was not dead, but wounded, and that he had escaped.\r\n\r\n\"If that be so,\" said Walter, \"then they must have been on Wapaw's\r\ntracks, an' if we search we shall find 'em, an' may follow 'em up.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Slugs, \"and the sooner we're away from this the better, for\r\nthe reptiles may return, and find us not so strong a band as they\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\nActing on this advice, the whole party set off at once.  Wapaw's track\r\nwas soon discovered, being, of course, a solitary one, and in advance of\r\nhis enemies, who were in pursuit.  Following the track with untiring\r\nvigour, the party found that it led them out of the lower country into a\r\nregion high up amongst the hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE PURSUIT.\r\n\r\n\"Wapaw must have worked hard, for we should have overhauled him by this\r\ntime,\" said Walter to his uncle on the evening of the next day, as they\r\nplodded steadily along through the snow.\r\n\r\n\"I would give up the pursuit,\" said Robin, somewhat gloomily, \"for it's\r\nlosin' time that might be better spent on another search; but it won't\r\ndo to leave the crittur, for if he's badly wounded he may die for want\r\no' help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess he can't be very bad, else he'd niver travel so fast,\" observed\r\nStiff, who, now that the chief murderer was punished, did not care much\r\nto go in search of the wounded Indian.\r\n\r\n\"When a man thinks a band o' yellin' redskins are follerin' up his\r\ntrail,\" said Slugs, \"he's pretty sure to travel fast, wounded or not\r\nwounded--leastways if he's able.  But I don't think we'll have to go\r\nmuch farther now, for I've noticed that his stride ain't so long as it\r\nwas, and that's a sartin sure sign that he's failin'; I only hope he\r\nwon't go under before we find him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Niver a fear o' that,\" said Larry O'Dowd, with a grin.  \"I've seed him\r\nas far gone as any one iver I comed across, wi' starvation; but the way\r\nthat fellow walked into the grub when he got the chance was wonderful to\r\nbehold!  I thought he'd ait me out o' the house entirely; and he put so\r\nmuch flesh on his bones in a week or two that he was able to go about\r\nhis business, though he warn't no fatter when he began to ait than a\r\nconsumptive darnin' needle.  True for ye--it's naither walkin',\r\nstarvin', nor cowld, as'll kill Wapaw.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does the Black Swan think?\" inquired Robin.\r\n\r\n\"We shall see Wapaw when the sun is low to-morrow,\" replied the Indian.\r\n\r\n\"Mayhap we shall,\" quoth Robin, \"but it behooves us to get the steam up\r\nfor to-morrow: so, comrades, as there's a good clump o' timber here\r\naway, we'll camp.\"\r\n\r\nRobin threw down his bundle as he spoke, and his example was at once\r\nfollowed by the others, each of whom set to work vigorously to assist in\r\npreparing the encampment.\r\n\r\nThey had all the requisite implements for this purpose, having returned,\r\nafter the attack on the Indians, for the things they had left behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"It's a pity that we shall have to keep watch to-night,\" said Walter;\r\n\"one of us will have to do it, I fancy; for though I don't believe these\r\nmurderin' redskins have pluck to attack us, it would not do to trust to\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nSlugs, to whom this remark was addressed, lowered the axe with which he\r\nwas about to fell a neighbouring tree for firewood.\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said he, looking round him in all directions; \"hold on,\r\ncomrades, yonder's a mound with a bare top, we'd better camp there.\r\nMakin' a big blaze on sitch a place'll show the red reptiles we don't\r\ncare a gun-flint for them, and they'll not dare to come near, so we\r\nwon't have to watch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! an' a purty spot it'll be for the blackyirds to shoot us all\r\naisy as we're sottin' at supper,\" exclaimed Larry O'Dowd.\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless there's a hollow on it,\" rejoined Slugs, \"for the top is\r\nflat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! maybe,\" growled Larry, who still seemed to object; but, as the\r\nrest of the party were willing to adopt the suggestion, he said no more,\r\nand they all went to the top of the little mound, which commanded a\r\nclear view of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nAs Slugs had surmised, there was a slight hollow on the summit of the\r\nmound, which effectually screened the party from any one who might wish\r\nto fire at them from below; and as there was no other mound in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, they felt quite secure.  Huge logs were cut and\r\ncarried to the top of the mound, the snow was cleared out of the hole,\r\npine branches were spread over it, the fire was kindled, the kettle put\r\non and filled with snow, and soon Larry O'Dowd was involved in the heat,\r\nsteam, smoke, and activities of preparing supper, while his comrades\r\nspread out their blankets and lay down to smoke with their arms ready\r\nbeside them.\r\n\r\nThe fire roared up into the wintry sky, causing the mound to resemble\r\nthe cone or crater of a volcano, which could be seen for miles round.\r\nEver and anon, while supper was being eaten, the Black Swan or Slugs\r\nwould rise, and going stealthily to the edge of the mound would peep\r\ncautiously over, to make sure that none of their enemies were\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nImmediately after supper, they all lay down to sleep, but, for a time,\r\neach motionless form that lay rolled tightly in its blanket like an\r\nEgyptian mummy, sent a series of little puffs from its head.  At last\r\nthe stars came out, and the pipes dropped from each sleeper's lips.\r\nThen the moon rose--a circumstance which rendered their position still\r\nmore secure--and the fire sank low.  But Slugs was too cautious a hunter\r\nto trust entirely to the alleged cowardice of the savages.  He knew well\r\nthat many, indeed most of the redskins, bad as well as good, had quite\r\nenough of mere brute courage to make them dare and risk a good deal for\r\nthe sake of scalping a white hunter, so he rose once or twice during the\r\nnight to replenish the fire and take a look round; and as often as he\r\nrose for these purposes, so often did he observe the glittering eye of\r\nthe Black Swan glaring round the encampment, although its owner never\r\nonce moved from his recumbent posture.\r\n\r\nThus the night was spent.  The first glimmer of daylight found the whole\r\nparty up and equipped for the journey.\r\n\r\nThey did not breakfast before setting out, as they preferred to take\r\ntheir morning meal later in the day.  Few words were spoken.  At that\r\nearly hour, and in the sleepy condition which usually results from a\r\n_very_ early start, men are seldom inclined to talk.  Only one or two\r\nmonosyllables were uttered as each man rolled up his blanket with his\r\nshare of the provisions in it, and fastened on his snow-shoes.  A few\r\nminutes later Robin led the way down the slope, and the whole party\r\nmarched off in single file, and re-entered the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nINTERESTING THOUGH PUZZLING DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o'clock they halted for breakfast, which Larry O'Dowd\r\nprepared with his accustomed celerity, and assisted to consume with his\r\nwonted voracity.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothin' like aitin' when yer hungry,\" observed Larry, with his\r\nmouth full.\r\n\r\n\"'Xcept drinking when you're dry,\" said Stiff, ironically.\r\n\r\n\"Now I don't agree with ye,\" retorted Larry; \"I used to think so wance,\r\nbefore I left the owld country--my blissin' rest on it.  I used to think\r\nthere was nothin' like drink, an' sure I was right, for there niver\r\n_was_ anythin' like it for turnin' a poor man into a baste; but when I\r\ncomed into the woods here I couldn't get drink for love or money, an'\r\nsure I found, after a while, I didn't need it, and got on better widout\r\nit, an' enjoyed me life more for want of it.  Musha! it's little I care\r\nfor drink now; but, och!  I've a mortal love for aitin'!\"\r\n\r\nIt needed not Larry's assurance to convince his hearers of the fact, for\r\nhe consumed nearly twice as much dried meat as any of his comrades.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if ye don't drink gin-sling or cocktail,\" said Stiff, \"you're\r\nmighty hard on the tea.\"\r\n\r\n\"True for ye, Stiff, it was the fav'rite tipple o' me owld mother, an'\r\nI'm fond of it on that score, not to mention other raisins of a private\r\nnatur'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't ye make these reasons public?\" said Walter.\r\n\r\n\"Unpossible!\" said Larry, with much gravity, as he helped himself to\r\nanother can of tea.\r\n\r\n\"Come, time's up,\" said Robin abruptly, as he rose to put on his\r\nsnow-shoes.\r\n\r\nLarry swallowed the tea at a draught, the others rose promptly, and in a\r\nfew minutes more they were again on the march.\r\n\r\nTowards noon they issued out of the woods upon a wide undulating\r\ncountry, which extended, as far as the eye could see, to faint blue\r\nmountains in the distance.  This region was varied in character and\r\nextremely beautiful.  The undulations of the land resembled in some\r\nplaces the waves of the sea.  In other places there were clumps of trees\r\nlike islets.  Elsewhere there were hollows in which lakelets and ponds\r\nevidently existed, but the deep snow covered all these with a uniform\r\ncarpet.  In some parts the ground was irregular and broken by miniature\r\nhills, where there were numerous abrupt and high precipices.\r\n\r\nThe party were approaching one of the latter in the afternoon, when\r\nRobin suddenly paused and pointed to a projecting ledge on the face of\r\none of the cliffs.\r\n\r\n\"What would ye say yonder objic' was?\" he inquired of Slugs.\r\n\r\nThe hunter shaded his eyes with his hand, and remained silent for a few\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n\"It _looks_ like a sled,\" said he, dropping his hand, \"but how it got\r\nthar' would puzzle even a redskin to tell, for there's no track up to\r\nthat ledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ a sled,\" said Black Swan, curtly.\r\n\r\n\"An' how came it there?\" asked Robin.\r\n\r\n\"It fell from the top,\" replied the Indian.\r\n\r\n\"Right, lad, yer right!\" said Slugs, who had taken another long look at\r\nthe object in question; \"I see somethin' like a broken tree near the top\r\no' the precipice.  I hope Wapaw hain't gone an' tumbled over that\r\ncliff.\"\r\n\r\nThis supposition was received in silence and with grave looks, for all\r\nfelt that the thing was not impossible, but the Indian shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Black Swan,\" said Walter, \"you don't agree with us--what think\r\nye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wapaw had no sled with him,\" replied the Indian.\r\n\r\n\"Right again!\" cried Slugs; \"I do believe my sense is forsakin' me; an\r\nInjun baby might have thought of that, for his tracks are plain enough.\r\nHows'ever, let's go see, for it's o' no use standin' here guessin'.\"\r\n\r\nThe party at once advanced to the foot of the precipice, and for nearly\r\nan hour they did their utmost to ascend to the ledge, on which the\r\nsledge lay, but their efforts were in vain.  The rock was everywhere too\r\nsteep and smooth to afford foot-hold.\r\n\r\n\"It won't do,\" said Larry, wiping the perspiration from his brow; \"av we\r\nhad wings we might, but we hain't got 'em, so it's o' no manner o' use\r\ntryin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall try from the top now,\" said Robin.  \"If anybody _has_ tumbled\r\nover, the poor crittur may be alive yet, for all we know.\"\r\n\r\nThey found their efforts to descend from the top of the precipice\r\nequally fruitless and much more dangerous, and although they spent a\r\nlong time in the attempt, and taxed their wits to the utmost, they were\r\nultimately compelled to leave the place and continue their journey\r\nwithout attaining their object.\r\n\r\nOne discovery was made, however.  It was ascertained by the old marks in\r\nthe snow at the edge of the precipice that, whatever members of the\r\nparty who owned the sledge had tumbled over, at least two of them had\r\nescaped, for their track--faint and scarcely discernible--was traced for\r\nsome distance.  It was found, also, that Wapaw's track joined this old\r\none.  The wounded Indian had fallen upon it not far from the precipice,\r\nand, supposing, no doubt, that it would lead him to some encampment, he\r\nhad followed it up.  Robin and his men also followed it--increasing\r\ntheir speed as much as possible.\r\n\r\nNight began to descend again, but Wapaw was not overtaken, despite the\r\nBlack Swan's prophecy.  This, however, was not so much owing to the\r\nmiscalculation of the Indian, as to the fact that a great deal of time\r\nhad been lost in their futile endeavour to reach the sledge that had\r\nfallen over the precipice.\r\n\r\nAbout sunset they came to a place where the track turned suddenly at a\r\nright angle and entered the bushes.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! the first travellers must have camped here, and Wapaw has followed\r\ntheir example,\" said Robin, as he pushed aside the bushes.  \"Just so,\r\nhere's the place, but the ashes are cold, so I fear we are not so near\r\nour Injun friend as we could wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it can't be helped,\" cried Stiff, throwing down his bundle;\r\n\"we've had plenty o' walkin' for one day, so I vote for supper right\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"I second the motion,\" said Walter, seizing his axe, \"seein' that the\r\ncamp is ready made to hand.  Now, Larry, get your pot ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure it's stuffed full a'ready--an' I only wish I was in the same\r\nstate,\" said the Irishman, as he pressed the snow tightly into a tin\r\nkettle, and hung it over the fire, which Slugs had just kindled.\r\n\r\nThe supper scene of the previous night was, in most of its details,\r\nenacted over again; but it was resolved that each of the party should\r\nkeep watch for an hour, as, if the Indians had followed, there was a\r\npossibility of their having gained on them during the delay at the\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\nBefore the watch was set, however, and while all the party were enjoying\r\ntheir pipes after supper, the Black Swan suddenly exclaimed, \"Ho!\" and\r\npointed with his finger to something which peeped out of the snow at\r\nLarry's elbow, that volatile individual having uncovered it during some\r\nof his eccentric movements.\r\n\r\n\"It's only an owld mocassin,\" said Larry, plucking the object from the\r\nsnow as he spoke; \"some Injun lad has throw'd it away for useless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hand it here,\" said Robin, re-lighting his pipe, which had gone out.\r\n\r\nLarry tossed the mocassin to his leader, who eyed it carelessly for a\r\nmoment.  Suddenly he started, and, turning the mocassin over, examined\r\nit with close and earnest attention.  Then he smiled, as if at his\r\npassing anxiety, and dropped it on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"It reminded me,\" said he to Walter, \"of my Nelly, for it has something\r\nof the same shape that she was fond of, an' for a moment I was foolish\r\nenough to think it might ha' belonged to the dear child, but--.  Come,\r\nLarry, have 'ee got any more tea there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it tay ye want? faix, then, it's little more nor laves that's\r\nremainin',\" said Larry, draining the last drops into a pannikin; \"well,\r\nthere's about half a mug-full, afther all; it's wonderful what can be\r\ngot out o' it sometimes by squaazin' the pot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hand it over, that's enough,\" said Robin, \"thank 'ee, lad--here's\r\nluck.\"\r\n\r\nHe drained the pannikin as though it had been a glass of rum, and,\r\nsmacking his lips, proceeded leisurely to refill his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"Are ye sure it's _not_ one of Nelly's old mocassins?\" asked Walter, as\r\nhe eyed the little shoe earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough, nephy, I would know her mother's make among ten thousand,\r\nan' although that one is oncommon like it in some respec's, it ain't one\r\no' _hers_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Nelly might have made it herself,\" suggested Walter, \"and that\r\nwould account for its bein' like her mother's in the make.\"\r\n\r\nRobin shook his head.  \"Not likely,\" said he.  \"The child didn't use to\r\nmake mocassins.  I'm not sure if she could do it at all; besides she was\r\nlast heard of miles and miles away from here in another direction.  No,\r\nno, Walter lad, we mustn't let foolish fancies bother us.  However, the\r\nsight o' this has fixed me to push on to-morrow as hard as I can lay my\r\nlegs to it, for if Wapaw's alive we can't fail to come up wi' him afore\r\nsundown; and I'm keen to turn about an' go after my children.  I'll push\r\non by myself if ye don't care to keep up wi me.\"\r\n\r\nThis latter remark was made to Stiff, whose countenance indicated that\r\nhe had no desire to undertake a harder day's march than usual.  The\r\neffect of the remark was to stir up all the Yankee's pride.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell 'ee what it is, _Mister_ Gore,\" said he, tartly; \"you may\r\nthink yourself an oncommon hard walker, but Obadiah Stiff is not the man\r\nto cave in to any white man alive.  I don't care to go trampin' over the\r\ncountry day after day, like the Wandering Jew, after a redskin, as, I'll\r\ngo bound, ain't no better than the rest o' his kind; but if ye want to\r\nsee which of our legs is the best pair o' compasses, I'll walk with ye\r\nfrom here to hereafter, I guess, or anywhar else ye choose; if I don't,\r\nthen my name ain't Stiff.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be well av it worn't Stiff, for ye've no reason to be proud\r\no't,\" observed Larry O'Dowd, with a grin; \"don't spake so loud, man, but\r\nshut up yer potatie trap and go to roost.  Ye'll need it all if ye\r\nwouldn't like to fall behind to-morrow.  There now, don't reply; ye've\r\nno call to make me yer father confessor, and apologise for boastin';\r\ngood night, an' go to slape!\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party, who had lain down, laughed at this sally, and\r\nStiff, on consideration, thought it best to laugh too.  In a few minutes\r\nevery one in the encampment was sound asleep, with the exception of\r\nRobin Gore, who took the first hour of watching, and who sat beside the\r\nsinking fire like a Indian in earnest meditation, with his eyes resting\r\ndreamily on the worn-out mocassin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nSHORT ALLOWANCE, AND A SURPRISE.\r\n\r\nOnce again we return to Silver Lake; but here we do not find affairs as\r\nwe left them.  True, Roy and Nelly are still there, the hut is as snug\r\nas it used to be, and the scenery as beautiful, but provisions have\r\nbegun to fail, and an expression of real anxiety clouds the usually\r\ncheerful countenance of Roy, while reflected anxiety sits on the sweet\r\nlittle face of Nell.  The winter is far advanced, and the prospect of\r\nresuming the journey home is farther off than ever.\r\n\r\nOne morning Roy entered the hut with a slow step and a sad countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Nell,\" said he, throwing down a small fish which he had just caught,\r\n\"things look very bad now; seems to me that we'll starve here.  Since we\r\nbroke the long line I've only caught little things like _that_; there's\r\nno rabbits in the snares--I looked at every one this mornin'--and, as\r\nfor deer, they seem to have said good-bye for the winter.  I thought of\r\ngoin' out with the gun this forenoon, but I think it a'nt o' no use, for\r\nI was out all yesterday without seeing a feather or a hoof-print.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone in which Roy said this, and the manner in which he flung\r\nhimself down on the ground beside the fire, alarmed his sister greatly,\r\nso that she scarcely knew what to say.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know what's to be done at all,\" continued Roy somewhat peevishly.\r\n\r\nThis was so unlike himself that the little girl felt a strong tendency\r\nto burst into tears, but she restrained herself.  After a short silence,\r\nshe said somewhat timidly--\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think we might try to pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the use,\" said Roy quickly; \"I'm sure I've prayed often and\r\noften, and so have you, but nothin's come of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident that Roy was in a state of rebellion.  This was the\r\nfirst time Nelly had suggested _united_ prayer to her brother; she did\r\nit timidly, and the rebuff caused her to shrink within herself.\r\n\r\nRoy's quick eye observed the shrinking; he repented instantly, and,\r\ndrawing Nelly to him, laid her head on his breast.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, Nell, I shouldn't have said it; for, after all, we've had\r\neverything given to us here that we have needed up to this time.  Come,\r\nI _will_ pray with you.\"\r\n\r\nThey both got upon their knees at once, but, strive as he might, not a\r\nword would cross Roy's lips for several minutes.  Nelly raised her head\r\nand looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"God help us!\" he ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"For Jesus' sake,\" murmured Nelly.\r\n\r\nThey both said \"Amen\" to these words, and these were all their prayers.\r\n\r\nRoy's rebellion of heart was gone now, but his feelings were not yet\r\ncalmed.  He leaped up, and, raising his sister, kissed her almost\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lass, we _have_ prayed, and I _do_ believe that God will answer\r\nus; so I'll take my gun and snow-shoes, an' off to the woods to look for\r\na deer.  See that you have a roarin' fire ready to roast him three hours\r\nhence.\"\r\n\r\nNelly smiled through her tears and said she would, while Roy slipped his\r\nfeet through the lines of his snow-shoes, threw his powder-horn and\r\nbullet-pouch over his shoulder, seized his gun, and sallied forth with a\r\nlight step.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, Nelly began actively to prepare for the fulfilment of\r\nher promise.  She took up the axe which Roy had left behind him, and\r\nwent into the forest behind the hut to cut firewood.  She was very\r\nexpert at this laborious work.  Her blows were indeed light, for her\r\nlittle arms, although strong for their size, were not strong for such\r\nlabour; but she knew exactly where to hit and how to hit.  Every stroke\r\nfell on the right spot, with the axe at the right angle, so that a chip\r\nor two flew off every time.  She panted a good deal, and grew uncommonly\r\nwarm, but she liked the work; her face glowed and her eyes sparkled, and\r\nit was evident that she was not exhausted by it.  In little more than an\r\nhour she had cut enough of dry wood to make a fire that would have\r\nroasted an entire sheep.  Then she carried it to the hut, after which\r\nshe sat down to rest a little.\r\n\r\nWhile resting, she gathered carefully together all the scraps of food in\r\nthe hut, and found that there was still enough for two good meals; so\r\nshe ate a small piece of dried fish, and began to wish that Roy would\r\nreturn.  Suddenly she was startled by a loud fluttering noise close to\r\nthe hut, and went out to see what it could be.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that a little girl in such solitary and unprotected\r\ncircumstances would have felt alarmed, and thought of wolves or bears;\r\nbut Nelly was too well accustomed to the dangers and risks of the\r\nbackwoods to be much troubled with mere fancies.  She was well aware\r\nthat wolves and bears, as a rule, shun the presence of human beings, and\r\nthe noise which she had heard was not of a very alarming character.\r\n\r\nThe first sight that greeted her was a large bird of the grouse species,\r\nsitting on a tree not three yards from the hut.  She almost felt that by\r\nspringing forward she could seize it with her hands, and her first\r\nimpulse was to throw the axe at it; but, checking herself, she went\r\nnoiselessly back into the hut, and quickly reissued with the bow and a\r\ncouple of arrows.\r\n\r\nFitting an arrow to the string, she whispered to herself, \"Oh, how I\r\n_do_ hope I won't miss it!\" and took a careful aim.  Anxiety, however,\r\nmade her hand unsteady, for, the next moment, the arrow was quivering in\r\nthe stem of the tree at least three inches below the bird.\r\n\r\nA look of deep disappointment was mingled with an expression of\r\ndetermination as she pursed her little mouth and fitted the second arrow\r\nto the string.  This time she did not take so careful an aim, but let\r\nfly at once, and her shaft entered the bird's throat and brought it to\r\nthe ground.  With a cry of delight she sprang upon her prize, and bore\r\nit in triumph into the hut, where she speedily plucked it.  Then she\r\nsplit it open, and went down to the lake and washed it quite clean and\r\nspread it out flat.  Her next proceeding was to cut a short stick, about\r\ntwo feet in length, which she pointed at both ends, making one point\r\nthinner than the other.  This thin point she thrust through the bird,\r\nand stuck it up before the fire to roast, placing a small dish, made of\r\nbirch bark, below it to catch the dripping.\r\n\r\n\"I hope he won't come back till it's ready,\" she muttered, as the skin\r\nof the bird began to brown and frizzle, while a delicious odour began to\r\nfill the hut.\r\n\r\nJust as the thought was uttered, a footstep was heard outside, the\r\ncovering of the doorway was raised, a tall figure stooped to enter, and\r\nthe next instant a gaunt and half-naked savage stood before her.\r\n\r\nNelly uttered a faint cry of terror, but she was so paralysed that she\r\ncould make no effort to escape, even had escape been possible.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Indian was indeed calculated to strike terror to a\r\nstouter heart than that of poor Nelly; for besides being partially clad\r\nin torn garments, his eyes were sunken and bloodshot, and his whole\r\nperson was more or less smeared with blood.\r\n\r\nAs the poor child gazed at this apparition in horror, the Indian said,\r\n\"Ho!\" by way of salutation, and stepping forward, took her hand gently\r\nand shook it after the manner of the white man.  A gleam of intelligence\r\nand surprise at once removed the look of fear from Nelly's face.\r\n\r\n\"Wapaw!\" she exclaimed breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" replied the Indian, with a nod and a smile, as he laid aside his\r\ngun and snowshoes, and squatted himself down before the fire.\r\n\r\nThere was not much to be gathered from \"ho!\" but the nod and smile\r\nproved to Nelly that the intruder was indeed none other than her old\r\nfriend Wapaw.\r\n\r\nHer alarm being now removed, she perceived that the poor Indian was\r\nsuffering both from fatigue and wounds--perhaps from hunger too; but\r\nthis latter idea was discarded when she observed that several birds,\r\nsimilar to the one she had just killed, hung at the Indian's belt.  She\r\nrose up quickly, therefore, and, running down to the lake, soon returned\r\nwith a can of clear water, with which she purposed bathing Wapaw's\r\nwounds.  Wapaw seized the can, however, and emptied the contents down\r\nhis throat, so she was constrained to go for a second supply.\r\n\r\nHaving washed the wounds, which were chiefly on the head and appeared to\r\nher to be very severe, although, in reality, they were not so, she set\r\nthe roasted bird before him and desired him to eat.\r\n\r\nOf course she had put a great many questions to Wapaw while thus\r\noccupied.  Her residence with the Indians had enabled her to speak and\r\nunderstand the Indian tongue a little, and, although she had some\r\ndifficulty in understanding much of what Wapaw said in reply, she\r\ncomprehended enough to let her know that a number of white men had been\r\nkilled by the savages, and that Wapaw was fleeing for his life.\r\n\r\nOn first hearing this a deadly paleness overspread her face, for she\r\nimagined that the white people killed must be her own kindred; but Wapaw\r\nquickly relieved her mind on this point.\r\n\r\nAfter this he devoted himself entirely to the roasted bird, and Nelly\r\nrelated to him, as well as she could, the particulars of her own and\r\nRoy's escape from the Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nMORE SURPRISING DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus occupied, a cry was heard to ring through the\r\nforest.  The Indian laid his hand on his gun, raised his head, which he\r\nturned to one side in a listening attitude, and sat as still as a dark\r\nstatue.  The only motion that could be detected in the man was a slight\r\naction in his distended nostrils as he breathed gently.\r\n\r\nThis attitude was but momentary, however, for the cry was repeated (\"Hi!\r\nNelly, hi!\") in clear silvery tones, and Wapaw smiled as he recognised\r\nRoy's voice, and quietly resumed his former occupation.\r\n\r\nNelly bounded up at once, and ran out to receive her brother, and tell\r\nhim of the arrival of their old friend.\r\n\r\nShe slipped on her snow-shoes, and went off in the direction of the cry.\r\nOn rounding the foot of a cliff she discovered Roy, standing as if he\r\nhad been petrified, with his eyes glaring at the snow with a mingled\r\nlook of surprise and alarm.\r\n\r\nNelly's step roused him.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!  Nell,\" he cried, giving vent to a deep sigh of relief, \"I'm\r\nthankful to see you--but look here.  What snow-shoe made _this_ track?\r\nI came on it just this moment, and it pulled me up slick, I can tell\r\nye.\"\r\n\r\nNelly at once removed Roy's alarm, and increased his surprise by telling\r\nhim of the new arrival, who, she said, was friendly, but she did not\r\ntell him that he was an old friend.\r\n\r\n\"But come, now, what have you got for dinner, Roy?\" said Nelly, with an\r\narch smile, \"for oh!  I'm _so_ hungry.\"\r\n\r\nRoy's countenance fell, and he looked like a convicted culprit.\r\n\r\n\"Nell, I haven't got nothin' at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"_What_ a pity!  We must just go supperless to bed, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, lass, I see by the twinkle in your eye that you've got grub\r\nsomehow or other.  Has the redskin brought some 'at with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he has brought a little; but the best fun is that I shot a bird\r\nmyself, and had it all ready beautifully cooked for your supper, when\r\nWap--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what d'ye mean by Wap?\" inquired Roy, as Nelly stopped short.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.  I only meant to say that the Indian arrived suddenly, and ate\r\nit all up.\"\r\n\r\n\"The villain!  Well, I'll pay him off by eatin' up some o' _his_ grub.\r\nDid he say what his name was, or where he came from?\" inquired Roy.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, you can ask him yourself,\" said Nelly, as they drew near to\r\nthe hut; \"he seems to me to have been badly wounded by his enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThey stooped and entered the hut as Nelly spoke.  The Indian looked up\r\nat her brother, and, uttering his wonted \"Ho!\" held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Good luck to ye!\" cried Roy, grasping it and shaking it with a feeling\r\nof hearty hospitality.  \"It's good to see yer face, though it _is_ a\r\nstrange un; but--hallo!--I say--yer face ain't so strange, after all!--\r\nwhat!  Why, you're not Wap--Wap--Wapaw!\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian displayed all his teeth, which were very numerous and\r\nremarkably white, and nodded his head gently.\r\n\r\n\"Well now, that beats everything!\" cried Roy, seizing the Indian's hand\r\nagain and shaking it violently; then, turning to Nelly, he said, \"Come,\r\nNell, stir yer stumps and pluck two o' them birds.  I'll split 'em, an'\r\nwash 'em, an' roast 'em, an' we'll all eat 'em--Wapaw'll be ready for\r\nmore before it's ready for him.  Jump, now, and see if we don't have a\r\nfeast to-night, if we should starve to-morrow.  But I say, Wapaw, don't\r\nye think the redskins may be after you yet?\"\r\n\r\nThe first part of this speech was uttered in wild glee, but the last\r\nsentence was spoken more earnestly, as the thought occurred to him that\r\nWapaw might have been closely pursued, for Nelly had told him of the\r\nIndian having been wounded by enemies and obliged to fly.\r\n\r\nWapaw shook his head, and made his young friend understand as well as he\r\ncould that there was little chance of that, as he had travelled with the\r\nutmost speed in order to distance his pursuers, and induce them to give\r\nup the chase.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it may be as you say, friend,\" observed Roy, as he sat down\r\nbefore the fire and pulled off his hunting mocassins and socks, which he\r\nreplaced by lighter foot-gear more suited to the hut; \"but I don't much\r\nlike the notion o' givin' them a chance to come up and cut all our\r\nthroats at once.  It's not likely, however, that they'll be here\r\nto-night, considerin' the pace you say you came at, so we'll make our\r\nminds easy, but with your leave we'll cut our sticks to-morrow, an' make\r\ntracks for Fort Enterprise.  We han't got much in the way o' grub to\r\nstart wi', it is true, but we have enough at least for two days' eatin',\r\nand for the rest, we have our guns, and you to be our guide.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan was agreed to by Wapaw, who thereupon advised that they should\r\nall lie down to sleep without delay.  Roy, who was fatigued with his\r\nday's exertions, agreed, and in less than half an hour the three were\r\nsound asleep.\r\n\r\nNext morning they arose with the sun, much refreshed; and while Wapaw\r\nand Nelly collected together and packed on their new sledge the few\r\nthings that they possessed, Roy went for the last time to cast his line\r\nin Silver Lake.  He was more fortunate than usual, and returned in an\r\nhour with four fine fish of about six pounds' weight each.\r\n\r\nWith this acceptable, though small, addition to their slender stock of\r\nprovisions, they left the hut about noon, and commenced their journey,\r\nmaking a considerable _detour_ in order to avoid meeting with any of the\r\nIndians who might chance to have continued the pursuit of Wapaw.\r\n\r\nThat same evening, towards sunset, a party of hunters marched out of the\r\nwoods, and stood upon the shores of Silver Lake, the tracks about which\r\nthey began to examine with particular interest.  There were six of the\r\nparty, five of them being white hunters, and one an Indian.  We need\r\nscarcely add that they were our friend Robin and his companions.\r\n\r\n\"I tell 'ee what it is,\" cried Robin, in an excited tone, \"that's my\r\nNelly's fut; I'd know the prints o't among a thousand, an' it's quite\r\nplain Roy is with her, an' that Wapaw has come on 'em, for their tracks\r\nare clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure it looks like it,\" observed Larry O'Dowd, scratching his head as\r\nif in perplexity, \"but the tracks is so mixed up, it ain't aisy to\r\nfoller 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"See, here's a well-beaten track goin' into the wood!\" cried Walter, who\r\nhad, like his companions, been searching among the bushes.\r\n\r\nEvery one followed Walter, who led the way towards the hut, which was\r\nfinally discovered with a thin, scarcely perceptible line of smoke still\r\nissuing from the chimney.  They all stopped at once, and held back to\r\nallow Robin to advance alone.  The poor man went forward with a beating\r\nheart, and stopped abruptly at the entrance, where he stood for a few\r\nseconds as if he were unable to go in.  At length he raised the curtain\r\nand looked in; then he entered quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Gone, Walter, they're gone!\" he cried; \"come in, lad, and see.  Here's\r\nevidence o' my dear children everywhere.  It's plain, too, that they\r\nhave left only a few hours agone.\"\r\n\r\n\"True for ye, the fire's hot,\" said Larry, lighting his pipe from the\r\nembers in testimony of the truth of his assertion.\r\n\r\n\"They can't be far off,\" said Slugs, who was examining every relic of\r\nthe absent ones with the most minute care.  \"The less time we lose in\r\nfollerin' of 'em the better--what think ye, lad?\"  The Black Swan nodded\r\nhis approval of the sentiment.\r\n\r\n\"What! without sleep or supper?\" cried Stiff, whose enthusiasm in the\r\nchase had long ago evaporated.\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said Robin sternly, \"_I_ start _now_.  Let those stop here who\r\nwill.\"\r\n\r\nTo do Stiff justice, his objections were never pressed home, so he\r\ncomforted himself with a quid of tobacco, and accompanied Robin and his\r\nmen with dogged resolution when they left the hut.  Plunging once more\r\ninto the forest, they followed up the track all night, as they had\r\nalready followed it up all day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nA GLADSOME MEETING.\r\n\r\nSome hours before dawn Robin Gore came to an abrupt pause, and looking\r\nover his shoulder, held up his hand to command silence.  Then he pointed\r\nto a small mound, on the top of which a faint glow of light was seen\r\nfalling on the boughs of the shrubs, with which it was crowned.\r\n\r\nThe moon had just set, but there was sufficient light left to render\r\nsurrounding objects pretty distinct.\r\n\r\n\"That's them,\" said Robin to Walter, in a low whisper, as the latter\r\ncame close to his side; \"no doubt they're sound asleep, an' I'm puzzled\r\nhow to wake 'em up without givin' 'em a fright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Musha! it's a fright that Wapaw will give _us_, av we start him\r\nsuddenly, for he's murtherin' quick wi' his rifle,\" whispered Larry.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better hide and then give a howl,\" suggested Stiff, \"an', after\r\nthey're sot up, bring 'em down with a familiar hail.\"\r\n\r\nThe deliberations of the party were out short and rendered unnecessary,\r\nhowever, by Wapaw himself.  That sharp-eared red man had been startled\r\nby the breaking of a branch which Larry O'Dowd chanced to set his foot\r\non, and, before Robin had observed their fire, he had roused Roy and\r\nNelly and hurried with them to the summit of a rocky eminence, from\r\nwhich stronghold they now anxiously watched the proceedings of the\r\nhunters.  The spot to which they had fled for refuge was almost\r\nimpregnable, and might have been held for hours by a couple of resolute\r\nmen against a host of savages.\r\n\r\nRobin, after a little further consultation, resolved to send the Black\r\nSwan in advance to reconnoitre.  This he did, contrary to his wonted\r\ncustom of taking the lead in everything, because of an unaccountable\r\nfeeling of dread lest he should not find his children there.\r\n\r\nBlack Swan at once stepped cautiously forward with his rifle, ready\r\ncocked, in the hollow of his left arm, and his finger on the\r\ntrigger-guard.  Step by step he moved towards the encampment without\r\nmaking the slightest noise, and with so little motion that he might\r\neasily have been mistaken for a dark shadow.  Raising his head over the\r\nedge of the encampment he gazed earnestly into it, then he advanced\r\nanother pace or two, finally he stepped into it, and, standing erect,\r\nlooked around him.  With a wave of his hand he summoned his comrades to\r\nadvance.  Robin Gore's heart beat hard as he approached, followed by the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they were closely watched by Roy and Wapaw.  When the Black\r\nSwan's head appeared, Roy exclaimed in a whisper, \"An Injun--d'ye know\r\nhim, Wapaw?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is one of our tribe, I think,\" replied the Indian, in the same low\r\nvoice, \"but I know him not; the light of the fire is not strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he's one o' your tribe,\" said Roy, \"it's all up with us, for they\r\nwon't be long o' findin' us here.  Keep close to me, Nell.  I'll stick\r\nby you, lass, don't fear.\"\r\n\r\nWapaw's brows lowered when he saw the Black Swan step into the\r\nencampment, and make the signal to his comrades to advance.  He raised\r\nhis rifle, and took deliberate aim at his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Roy,\" he whispered, \"get an arrow ready, aim at the next man that steps\r\ninto the light and let fly; I'll not fire till after you, for the smoke\r\nwould blind you.\"\r\n\r\nRoy obeyed with a trembling hand.  Notwithstanding the rough life he had\r\nled in those wild woods of the West, he had never yet been called on to\r\nlift his hand against a human being, and the thought of taking life in\r\nthis deliberate and almost murderous way caused him to shudder; still he\r\nfelt that their case was desperate, and he nerved himself to the deed.\r\n\r\nAnother moment, and Robin stood beside the Black Swan.  Roy tried to\r\nraise his bow, but his heart failed him.  Wapaw glanced at him, and said\r\nsternly--\r\n\r\n\"Shoot first.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Obadiah Stiff stepped into the encampment, and, stirring\r\nthe embers of the fire with a piece of stick, caused a bright flame and\r\nshowers of sparks to shoot upwards.  This revealed the fact that some of\r\nthe party were white men, so Wapaw lowered his rifle.  A single glance\r\nof his practised eye told him who they were.  Laying his hand suddenly\r\nand heavily on Roy's shoulder he pressed him down.\r\n\r\n\"Come, let us go,\" he said quickly; \"I must see these men alone, and you\r\nmust keep close--you _must not look_.\"\r\n\r\nHe said the latter words with emphasis; but in order to make sure that\r\nthey should not have a chance of looking, he led his young companions to\r\na point whence the encampment could not be seen, and left them there\r\nwith strict injunctions not to quit the spot until he should return.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds Wapaw stepped into the circle of light where Robin and\r\nhis party were all assembled, and so rapid and noiseless had his\r\nmovement been, that he was in the midst of them almost before they were\r\naware of his approach.\r\n\r\n\"Wapaw!\" exclaimed Walter in surprise, \"why, you seem to have dropped\r\nfrom the clouds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure it's a ghost ye must be,\" cried Larry.  The Indian took no notice\r\nof these remarks, but turned to Robin, who, with a look of deep anxiety,\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"Have 'ee seed the childer, Wapaw?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are safe,\" answered the Indian.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for that!\" cried Robin, while a sigh of relief burst from\r\nhim: \"I believe ye, Wapaw, yer a true man an' wouldn't tell me a lie,\r\nwould ye?\"\r\n\r\nThe tone in which the hunter said this implied that the statement was\r\nscarcely a true index to his feelings, and that he would be glad to hear\r\nWapaw assure him that he was indeed telling the truth.  But this Indian\r\nwas a man of truthfulness, and did not deem it necessary to repeat his\r\nassertion.  He said, however, that he would go and fetch the children,\r\nand immediately quitted the camp.  Soon after he returned with Roy and\r\nNelly; he had not told them, however, who the strangers were.\r\n\r\nWhen Roy first caught sight of his father he gave a shout of surprise,\r\nand stood still as if he were bewildered.  Nelly uttered a wild scream,\r\nand rushed forward with outstretched arms.  Robin met her more than half\r\nway, and the next moment folded his long-lost little one to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nAT SILVER LAKE ONCE MORE.\r\n\r\nIt were needless to detail all that was said and done during the\r\nremainder of that night, or, rather, morning, for day began to break\r\nsoon after the happy meeting narrated in the last chapter.  It would\r\nrequire more space than we can afford to tell of all that was said and\r\ndone; how Robin embraced his children over and over again in the\r\nstrength of his love, and thanked God in the fervour of his gratitude;\r\nhow Roy and Nelly were eager to relate all that had befallen them since\r\nthey were carried away into captivity, in a much shorter time than such\r\na long story could by any possibility be told; how Walter rendered the\r\ntelling of it much more difficult by frequent interruptions with eager\r\nquestions, which induced divergencies from which the tale-tellers forgot\r\nto return to the points where the interruptions occurred; how Larry\r\nO'Dowd complicated matters by sometimes volunteering anecdotes of his\r\nown, illustrative of points similar to those which were being related;\r\nhow Slugs always cut these anecdotes short with a facetious poke in the\r\nribs, which caused Larry to howl; how Stiff rendered confusion worse\r\nconfounded by trying to cook some breakfast, and by upsetting the whole\r\naffair into the fire; and how the children themselves broke in on their\r\nown discourse continually with sudden and enthusiastic questions as to\r\nthe health of their mother and the welfare of the live stock at Fort\r\nEnterprise.\r\n\r\nAll this cannot be described, therefore we leave it to the vivid\r\nimagination of the reader.\r\n\r\n\"Now, comrades,\" said Robin, after the sun had risen, after breakfast\r\nhad been and eaten, after every incident had been related at least twice\r\nover, and after every conceivable question had been asked four or five\r\ntimes--\"now, comrades, it remains for us to fix what we'll do.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the Fort,\" said Larry O'Dowd abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Ay--home!\" cried Walter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes--home--home!\" exclaimed Roy and Nelly in the same breath.\r\n\r\n\"Ditto,\" observed Obadiah Stiff.\r\n\r\nSlugs and the Black Swan, being men of few words, said nothing, but\r\nnodded approval.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's quite plain that we're all of one mind,\" resumed Robin;\r\n\"nevertheless, there are one or two points to which I ax yer attention.\r\nIn the first place, it's now near the end of November.  Fort Enterprise,\r\nin a straight line, is more nor three weeks' march from hereaway.  Our\r\nprovisions is low.  When I left the Fort provisions was low there too,\r\nan' if my brother Jeff ha'nt had more nor his usual luck in huntin'\r\nthey'll be lower yet before long.  Now, I think it would be better to go\r\nback to Silver Lake for a week or so, hunt an' fish there till we've got\r\na good supply, make noo sleds, load 'em chock full, an' then--ho! for\r\nhome.  What say ye to that, comrades?\"\r\n\r\nAs every one assented readily to this plan, they proceeded at once to\r\ncarry it into execution.  At first, indeed, Nelly looked a little\r\ndisappointed, saying that she wanted to get to her darling mother\r\nwithout delay; but, on Walter pointing out to her that it would only\r\ndelay matters a week or so, and that it would enable the whole party to\r\nrest and recruit, and give Wapaw time to recover thoroughly from his\r\nwounds, she became reconciled, and put on her snow-shoes to return to\r\nSilver Lake with some degree of cheerfulness; and when, in the course of\r\nthat day's walk, she began to tell her father of all the beauties and\r\nwonders of Silver Lake, she was not only reconciled but delighted to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\"O father!\" said she, as they walked briskly through the forest, \"you've\r\nno notion what a beautiful place Silver Lake is.  It's so clear, and\r\nso--so--oh!  I don't know how to tell you; so like the fairy places\r\nWalter used to tell us of, with clear water and high cliffs, and the\r\nclouds shining up at the clouds shining down, and two suns--one below\r\nand another above.  And then the hut! we made it all ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! made the trees and all?\" said Robin, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not the trees; but we _cut_ the trees and piled 'em up,\r\nand spread the brush-wood, and--and--then the fish! we caught _such_ big\r\nones.\"\r\n\r\n\"How big, Nelly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ever so big!\"\r\n\r\n\"How big may that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, some were so long,\" (measuring off the size on her arm,) \"an'\r\nsome near as long as my leg--an' they were good to eat too--no good!\r\nyou've no notion; but you'll see and taste 'em too.  Then there's the\r\nshooskin'!  Did you ever shoosk, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, lass--leastways I don't remember, if I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know what it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, Nelly; ha'nt I seed ye do it often on the slopes at Fort\r\nEnterprise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the shooskin' here is far, _far_ better.  The first time Roy did\r\nit, he said it nearly banged all his bones to pieces--yes, he said he\r\nfelt as if his backbone was shoved up into his brain; and I sometimes\r\nthought it would squeeze all my ribs together.  Oh, it is _so_ nice!\r\nYou shall try it, father.\"\r\n\r\nRobin laughed heartily at this, and remarked that he would be very glad\r\nto try it, though he had no particular desire to have his ribs squeezed\r\ntogether, or his backbone shoved up into his brain!\r\n\r\nThen Nelly went on with great animation and volubility to tell of the\r\ntrapping of the bear, and the snaring of rabbits, and the catching of\r\nfish, and of Roy's peculiar method of wading into the lake for ducks,\r\nand many other things.\r\n\r\nRoy, meanwhile, entertained Walter and Larry O'Dowd with a somewhat\r\nsimilar account of their doings during the months of their residence in\r\nthat wild region; and thus the journey was beguiled, so that the time\r\nseemed to pass on swallows' wings.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the party approached the spot where Silver Lake had\r\nfirst burst upon the enraptured gaze of the wandering pair.  As they\r\ndrew near, Roy and Nelly hurried on in advance, and, mounting the fallen\r\ntree on which they had formerly rested, waved to the others to come on,\r\nand shouted for glee.  And well might they shout, for the evening\r\nhappened to be brighter and calmer, if possible, than the one on which\r\nthey first saw the lake.  The rolling clouds were whiter, too, and the\r\nwaters looked more silvery than ever.\r\n\r\nThe exclamations of delight, and the looks of admiration with which the\r\nglorious scene was greeted by the hunters when they came up, gratified\r\nthe hearts of Roy and Nelly very much.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _how_ I wish mother was here to see it!\" cried Nelly.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't _that_ a place for a king to live in, daddy?\" said Roy,\r\nenthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"So 'tis, lad, so 'tis--leastwise it's a goodish spot for a hunter.  How\r\nsay you, Slugs?\"\r\n\r\nSlugs smiled grimly, and nodded his head.\r\n\r\n\"Would the red man like to pitch his wigwam there?\" said Robin,\r\naddressing the Black Swan.\r\n\r\n\"He has pitched his wigwam here before,\" replied the Black Swan softly.\r\n\"When he first took the White Swan home to be his mate, he came to hunt\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! is it the honeymoon ye spint here?\" broke in Larry.  \"Faix, it's a\r\npurty spot for courtin', and no mistake.  Is that a beehive over there?\"\r\nhe added, pointing across the lake.\r\n\r\n\"Why that's our hut--our _palace_,\" cried Nell, with gleeful look.\r\n\r\n\"Then the sooner we get down to it, and have supper, the better,\"\r\nobserved Walter, \"for we'll have to work hard to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, then,\" cried Robin, \"an' go you ahead, Roy; beat the track,\r\nand show us the way.\"\r\n\r\nRoy accepted the position of honour.  Nelly followed him, and the whole\r\nband marched off in single file along the shores of Silver Lake.  They\r\nsoon reached the hut, and here again Nelly found many interesting points\r\nto dilate upon.  She poured her words into willing and sympathetic ears,\r\nso that she monopolised nearly all the talk during the time that Larry\r\nO'Dowd was preparing supper.\r\n\r\nWhen that meal was being eaten the conversation became more general.\r\nPlans were discussed as to the intended procedure on the morrow, and\r\nvarious courses of action fixed.  After that, as a matter of course, the\r\npipes came out, and while these were being smoked, only the talkative\r\nmembers of the party kept up the conversation at intervals.  Roy and\r\nNelly having exhausted all they had to say, began to feel desperately\r\nsleepy, and the latter, having laid her head on her father's knee, fell\r\nsound asleep in that position.  Soon the pipes were smoked out, the fire\r\nwas replenished, the blankets unrolled; and in a very brief period of\r\ntime the whole party was in a state of happy unconsciousness, with the\r\nexception of poor Wapaw, whose wounds made him rather restless, and the\r\nBlack Swan, whose duty it was to take the first watch; for it was,\r\ndeemed right to set a watch, lest by any chance the Indians should have\r\nfollowed the hunters' tracks, though this was not probable.\r\n\r\nNext morning Robin aroused the sleepers somewhat abruptly by shooting a\r\ngrey hen with his rifle from the tent door.\r\n\r\n\"There's breakfast for you and me, Nelly, at any rate,\" remarked the\r\nhunter, as he went down to the lake to secure his bird.\r\n\r\n\"An' won't there be the bones and feathers for the rest of us?\" observed\r\nLarry, yawning, \"so we won't starve this day, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes every man was actively engaged in work of some sort or\r\nother.  Robin and Walter prepared fishing-lines from some pieces of\r\nbuckskin parchment; Black Swan and Slugs went out to cut wood for making\r\nsledges; Stiff repaired the snow-shoes of the party, or rather assisted\r\nNelly in this operation; and Larry attended to the preparation of\r\nbreakfast.  Wapaw was the only one who lay still, it being thought\r\nbetter to make him rest, and get strong for the approaching journey.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the day the lines were tried, and a good number of\r\nfish caught.  Slugs also went off in search of deer, and returned in the\r\nevening with a large stag on his broad shoulders.  This raised the\r\nspirits of the party greatly, and they feasted that night, with much\r\nrejoicing, on venison, marrowbones, and broiled fish!\r\n\r\nThus they spent their time for several days.  One party went regularly\r\nevery morning to fish in the ice-holes; another party roamed the woods,\r\nand returned with grouse, or rabbits, and sometimes with deer; while\r\nsome remained, part of the day at least, in the hut, mending snow-shoes\r\nand moccasins, and making other preparations.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this busy labour, the shoosking was not forgotten.\r\nOne day Robin said to his little daughter, at breakfast, that as they\r\nhad got nearly enough of provisions for the journey they would take a\r\nholiday and go and have a shoosk.  The proposal was hailed with delight,\r\nand the whole party went off with the new sledges, and spent the\r\nforenoon in sliding and tumbling down the hills like very children.\r\n\r\nAt last everything was ready for a start.  The provisions were tightly\r\nfastened on the sledges, which were to be drawn by each of the men in\r\nturn.  Snow-shoes were put on, guns and bows looked to and shouldered,\r\nand on a bright, frosty December morning the hunters left the hut,\r\nstruck into the woods, and set out for Fort Enterprise.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the slope, beside the fallen tree, they stopped with one\r\nconsent and gazed back; and there Nelly took her last sad look at Silver\r\nLake, and sorrowfully said her last farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE HAPPIEST MEETING OF ALL.\r\n\r\nThe snow was driving through the forests and over the plains of the\r\nNorth American wilderness; the wind was shrieking among the tree-tops,\r\nand whirling the drift in great clouds high up into the frosty air; and\r\nthe sun was setting in a glow of fiery red, when, on the last day of the\r\nyear, Robin Gore and his followers came to an abrupt halt, and, with one\r\nconsent, admitted that \"the thing was impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't do it, boys,\" said Robin, resting his rifle against a tree;\r\n\"so it's o' no use to try.  The Fort is good ten miles off, an' the\r\nchildren are dead beat--\"\r\n\r\n\"No they ain't,\" interrupted Roy, whose tone and aspect, however, proved\r\nthat his father's statement was true; \"at least _I'm_ not beat yet--I'm\r\ngame for two or three hours more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, lad, p'raps ye are, but Nelly ain't; so we'll camp here, an' take\r\n'em by surprise in the morning early.\"\r\n\r\nNelly, who had been carried on the backs of those who had broadest\r\nshoulders during the last dozen miles, smiled faintly when spoken to,\r\nand said she was \"ve-y s'eepy!\"\r\n\r\nSo they set to work in the usual style, and were soon comfortably seated\r\nin their snowy encampment.\r\n\r\nNext morning before dawn Robin awoke them.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" he cried, \"get up, lads, look alive!  A happy New Year to 'ee all,\r\nyoung an' old, red an' white.  Kiss me, Nell, dear--a shake o' yer paw,\r\nRoy.  An' it's a good New Year's day, too, in more ways than one, praise\r\nthe Almighty for that.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole party was astir immediately, and that feeling of kindly\r\nbrotherhood which usually pervades the hearts of men on the first day of\r\na new year, induced them to shake hands heartily all round.\r\n\r\n\"You'll eat your New Year's dinner at home, after all,\" said Walter to\r\nNelly.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, an' it's a happy 'ooman yer mother'll be this good day,\" said\r\nLarry, as he stirred up the embers of the fire, and blew them into a\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nThe kettle was boiled, and a good breakfast eaten, because, although it\r\nis usually the custom for hunters to start on their day's journey, and\r\naccomplish a good many miles of it before breakfast, they had\r\nconsideration for Roy and Nelly, both of whom were still suffering a\r\nlittle from the fatigue of the previous day.  They hoped to be at Fort\r\nEnterprise in about four hours, and were anxious to arrive fresh.\r\n\r\nThe sun was rising when they reached the top of a ridge, whence they\r\ncould obtain a distant view of the Fort.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are _at home_, Nelly,\" said Robin, stooping down to kiss his\r\nchild on the forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Darling, _darling_ mother!\" was all that poor Nelly could say, as she\r\ntried in vain to see the Fort though the tears which sprang to her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see it, Nell?\" said Roy, passing his arm round his sister's\r\nwaist.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't,\" cried Nelly, brushing the tears away; \"oh, _do_ let us go\r\non!\"\r\n\r\nRobin patted her on the had, and at once resumed the march.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThat morning Mrs Gore rose from her bed about the saddest woman in the\r\nland.  Her mind flew back to the last New Year's day, when her children\r\nwere lost to her, as she feared, for ever.  The very fact that people\r\nare usually more jocose, and hearty, and happy, on the first day of the\r\nyear, was sufficient to make her more sorrowful than usual; so she got\r\nup and sighed, and then, not being a woman of great self-restraint, she\r\nwept.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes she dried her eyes, and took up her Bible, and, as she\r\nread its blessed pages, she felt comfort--such as the world can neither\r\ngive nor take away--gradually stealing over her soul.  When she met her\r\nkinsman and his friends at breakfast she was comparatively cheerful, and\r\nreturned their hearty salutation with some show of a reciprocal spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Jeff,\" said Mrs Gore, with a slight sigh, \"it's a year, this day,\r\nsince my two darlings were lost in the snow.\"\r\n\r\n\"D'ye say so?\" observed Jeff, as he sat down to his morning meal, and\r\ncommenced eating with much voracity.\r\n\r\nJeff was not an unkind man, but he was very stupid.  He said nothing\r\nmore for some time, but, after consuming nearly a pound of venison\r\nsteak, he observed suddenly--\r\n\r\n\"Wall, I guess it wor a bad business that--worn't it, missus?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was,\" responded Mrs Gore; and, feeling that she had no hope of\r\nmeeting with sympathy from Jeff, she relapsed into silence.  After a\r\ntime, she said--\r\n\r\n\"But we must get up a feast, Jeff.  It won't do to let New Year's day\r\npass without a good dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true as gosp'l,\" said Jeff.  \"Feed up is my motto, always.  It\r\ndon't much matter wot turns up, if ye don't feed up yer fit for nothin';\r\nbut, contrairy-wise, if ye do feed up, why yer ready for anythin' or\r\nnothin', as the case may be.\"\r\n\r\nHaving given vent to this sentiment, Jeff finished his meal with a\r\nprolonged draught of tea.\r\n\r\n\"Wall, now,\" said he, filling his pipe, \"we've got enough o' deer's meat\r\nan' other things to make a pretty fair feast, missus, but my comrades\r\nand we will go an' try to git somethin' fresh for dinner.  If we git\r\nnothin' else we'll git a appetite and that's worth a good long march any\r\nday; so, lads, if--\"\r\n\r\nJeff's speech was interrupted here by a sudden and tremendous outburst\r\nof barking on the part of the dogs of the establishment.  He sprang up\r\nand hastened to the door, followed by his companions and Mrs Gore.\r\n\r\n\"Injuns, mayhap; see to your guns, boys, we can niver be sure o' the\r\nreptiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're friendly,\" observed one of Jeff's friends, as they stood at the\r\nFort gate; \"enemies never come on in that straightforward fashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so sure o' that,\" said Jeff.  \"I've seen redskins do somethin' o'\r\nthat kind when they meant mischief; but, if my eyes ain't telling lies,\r\nI'd say there were white men there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, an' young folk, too,\" remarked one of the others.\r\n\r\n\"Young folk!\" exclaimed Mrs Gore, as she shaded her eyes from the sun\r\nwith her hand, and gazed earnestly at the band which was approaching.\r\n\r\nSuddenly one of them ran a little in advance of the rest, and waved a\r\nhandkerchief.  The figure was a small one.  A faint cheer was heard in\r\nthe distance.  It was followed, or rather accompanied, by a loud, manly,\r\nand well-known shout.\r\n\r\nMrs Gore grew pale, and would have fallen to the ground had not Jeff\r\ncaught and supported her.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I _do_ declare it's Robin--an'--eh! if there beant the children\r\nwi' 'im!\"\r\n\r\nThe advancing party broke into a run as he spoke, another loud cheer\r\nburst forth, and in a few seconds Nelly was locked once more in her dear\r\nmother's arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to say that there was joy--powerful, inexpressible--\r\nwithin the wooden walls of Fort Enterprise on that New Year's morning,\r\nand a New Year's hymn of praise welled up continually from the glad\r\nmother's heart, finding expression sometimes in her voice, but oftener\r\nin her eyes, as she gazed upon the faces of her dear ones, the lost and\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe flag at Fort Enterprise, which had not flaunted its red field from\r\nthe flagstaff since the sad day--that day twelve months exactly--when\r\nthe children were lost, once more waved gaily in the frosty air, and\r\nglowed in the beams of the wintry sun.  The sound of joyful revelry,\r\nwhich had not been heard within the walls of the Fort for a long, long\r\nyear, once again burst forth with such energy that one might have been\r\nled to suppose its being pent up so long had intensified its power.\r\n\r\nThe huge fireplace roared, and blazed, and crackled, with a log so\r\nmassive that no other Yule log in the known world could have held a\r\ncandle to it; and in, on, and around that fire were pots, pans, and\r\ngoblets innumerable, all of which hissed, and spluttered, and steamed at\r\nLarry O'Dowd, as if with glee at the sight of his honest face once again\r\npresiding over his own peculiar domain.  And the parlour of Fort\r\nEnterprise--that parlour which we have mentioned as being Robin's\r\ndining-room and drawing-room, besides being his bedroom and his\r\nkitchen--was converted into a leafy bower by means of pine branches and\r\nfestooned evergreens, and laid out for a feast the like of which had not\r\nbeen seen there for many a day, and which was transcendently more\r\nmagnificent than that memorable New Year's day dinner which had been\r\ncooked, but not eaten, just three hundred and sixty-five days before.\r\n\r\nIn short, everything in and about Fort Enterprise bore evidence that its\r\ninmates meant to rejoice and make merry on that first day of a new year,\r\nas it was meet they should do under such favourable circumstances.\r\n\r\nJeff Gore had shot a deer not many days before, and one of its fat\r\nhaunches was to be the great dish of the feast; but Robin said that it\r\nwas not enough: so, after the first congratulations were over, he and\r\nWalter, and Slugs, and Black Swan, set off into the forest, and ere long\r\nreturned with several brace of grouse, and a few rabbits.  Roy, with a\r\nvery sly look, had asked leave to go and have a walk on snow-shoes in\r\nthe woods with Nelly before dinner, but his father threatened to lock\r\nhim up in the cellar, so he consented to remain at home for that day and\r\nassist his mother.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Nelly, you and Roy will come help me to prepare the feast,\" said\r\nMrs Gore, whose eyes were swollen with joyful weeping till they looked\r\nlike a couple of inflamed oysters; \"not that there's much to do, for,\r\nnow that Larry is come back, we'll leave everything to him except the\r\npl-plum--poo--poo--ding--oh! _my_ darling!\"\r\n\r\nHere Mrs Gore broke down for the fifteenth time, and, catching Nelly to\r\nher bosom, hugged her.\r\n\r\n\"Darling mother!\" sighed Nelly.\r\n\r\n\"Och! but it's a sight good for sore eyes, anyhow,\" exclaimed Larry,\r\nlooking up from his occupation among the steaming pots and pans.\r\n\r\nWapaw, who was the only other member of the party who chose to remain in\r\nthe house during the forenoon of that day, sat smoking his pipe in the\r\nchimney corner, and regarded the whole scene with that look of stoical\r\nsolemnity which is peculiar to North American Indians.\r\n\r\n\"Come, I say, this'll never do, mother,\" cried Roy, going to the\r\nflour-barrel which stood in a corner.  \"If we're to help you wi' that\r\n'ere poodin', let's have at it at once.\"\r\n\r\nThus admonished, Mrs Gore and her recovered progeny set to work and\r\nfabricated a plum-pudding, which was nearly as hard, almost as heavy as,\r\nand much larger than a sixty-four pound cannon ball.  It would have\r\nkilled with indigestion half a regiment of artillery, but it could not\r\naffect the hardened frames of these men of the backwoods!\r\n\r\nIn course of time the board was spread, the viands smoked upon it, and\r\nthe united party set to work.  Mrs Gore sat at the head of the table,\r\nwith Nelly on one side and Roy on the other.  Robin sat at the foot,\r\nsupported by the White Swan on his right, and Wapaw on his left.  Ranged\r\nbetween these were Walter, Slugs, the Black Swan, Jeff Gore, Obadiah\r\nStiff, the two other strangers who came with Jeff, and Larry O'Dowd--for\r\nLarry acted the part of cook only, and did not pretend to \"wait.\"  After\r\nhe had placed the viands on the table, he sat down with the rest.  These\r\nbackwoodsmen ignored waiters.  They passed their plates from hand to\r\nhand, and when anything was wanted by any one he rose to fetch it\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAfter the plates were cleared away, the tea-kettle was put on the table.\r\nIn some parts of the backwoods spirits are (fortunately) so difficult\r\nto procure, that hunters and trappers live for many months without\r\ntasting a drop, and get into the habit of doing entirely without\r\nintoxicating drink of any kind.  Robin had no spirits except animal\r\nspirits, but he had plenty of tea.  When it was poured out into huge\r\ncups, which might have been styled small slop-basins, and sweetened and\r\npassed round, Robin applied his knuckles to the table to command\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Friends,\" said he, \"I niver wos much o' a speechifier, but I could\r\nalways manage to blurt out my meanin' somehow.  Wot I've got to say to\r\nyou this day is, I'm thankful to the Almighty for givin' me back my\r\nchilder, an' I'm right glad to see ye all under my roof this Noo Year's\r\nday, and so's the wife, _I_ know--ain't ye, Molly, my dear?\"\r\n\r\nTo this appeal Mrs G replied with a hysterical ye-es, and an\r\napplication of her apron to the inflamed oysters.  Robin continued--\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry there ain't nothin' stronger in the fort to give 'ee\r\nthan tea, but for my part I find it strong enough to keep up my spirits,\r\nan' yer all heartily welcome to swig buckets-full o' that.  There is an\r\nold fiddle in the store.  If any o' ye can scrape a tune, we'll have a\r\ndance.  If not, why we'll sing and be jolly.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was followed up by another from Obadiah Stiff, who, with a\r\ncountenance of the deepest solemnity, requested permission to make a few\r\nbrief observations.\r\n\r\n\"Friends,\" said he, turning the quid of tobacco which usually graced his\r\nright cheek into his left, \"it's not every day a man's got a chance o'--\r\no' wot I was a-goin' to obsarve is, that men who are so much indebted to\r\ntheir much-respected host as--as (Nelly happened to sneeze at this\r\npoint, and distracted Stiff's attention) as--yes, I guess we ha'nt often\r\ngot the chance to chase the redskins, and--and--.  In short, without\r\nmakin' an onnecessairy phrase about it--I'm happy to say that _I_ can\r\nplay the fiddle, so here's luck.\"\r\n\r\nMr Stiff sat down abruptly and drained his cup at a draught.\r\n\r\n\"Pr'aps,\" said Larry, with a twinkle in his eye, \"Mister Stiff would\r\nfavour the company wi' a song before we commence to cut capers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear, hear!\" from Walter.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" from Roy.\r\n\r\nMr Stiff cleared his throat and began at once.  The tune was so\r\ndolorous, and the voice so unmusical, that in any other circumstances it\r\nwould have been intolerable, but there were lines in it touching upon\r\n\"good fellowship,\" which partially redeemed it, and in the last verse\r\nthere was reference made to \"home,\" and \"absent friends,\" which rendered\r\nit a complete success, insomuch that it was concluded amid rapturous\r\ncheering, so true is it, as Walter observed, that, \"one touch of nature\r\ncovers a multitude of sins!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's drink to absent friends an' owld Ireland,\" cried Larry, filling\r\nhis cup and pushing the kettle round.\r\n\r\nThis was drunk with enthusiasm and was followed by a succession of\r\ntoasts and songs, which were drunk and sung not at the table, but round\r\nthe fire, to which the party withdrew in order to enjoy their pipes more\r\nthoroughly.  Then followed a number of anecdotes of stories--some true,\r\nsome doubtful, and some fabricated--which were listened to with deep\r\ninterest, not only by Roy and Nelly, but by the whole party, including\r\nthe Indians, who listened intently, with faces like owls, although they\r\ndid not understand a word that was said.\r\n\r\nMany of these stories were so touching that poor Mrs Gore's eyes became\r\nmore inflamed and more oyster-like than ever.  Nelly, too, became\r\nsympathetic, and her eyes were similarly affected.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening was pretty well advanced, the violin was sent for and\r\ntuned, and Stiff turned out to be a very fair player of Scotch reels; so\r\nthe party laid aside their pipes, cleared the floor, and began to dance.\r\n\r\nIt was rough but hearty dancing.  Each dancer composed his own steps on\r\nthe spur of the moment, but executed them with a degree of precision and\r\nviolence that would have caused civilised dancing masters to blush with\r\nshame and envy.  Mrs Gore and Nelly danced too, weeping the while with\r\njoy, and so did the White Swan, but her performances were peculiar.  She\r\ndanced with a slowness of manner and a rigidity of person that are\r\nutterly indescribable.  She looked as if all her joints had become\r\ninflexible, except those of her knees, and her arms hung straight down\r\nat her sides, while she pendulated about the floor and gazed at the\r\nrafters in deep solemnity.\r\n\r\nHow they did keep it up, to be sure!  Men of the backwoods find it no\r\neasy matter to fatigue their muscles or exhaust their spirits, so they\r\ndanced all night, and a considerable portion of next morning too.  Long\r\nbefore they gave in, however, the females were obliged to retire.  They\r\nlay down on their rude couches without taking the trouble to undress,\r\nand in a few moments after were sound asleep--Nelly locked in her\r\nmother's arms, with their two cheeks touching, their dishevelled hair\r\nmingling, and a few tears welling from their inflamed eyes, and mixing\r\nas they flowed slowly down their united noses.  Sleeping thus, the\r\nmother dreamed of home, and Nelly dreamed of Silver Lake.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReader, our tale is told.  We have not space to tell of what befell\r\nRobin Gore and his family in after life, but we may remark, in\r\nconclusion, that although Robin stoutly refused to go back to\r\ncivilisation, in the course of a few years civilisation considerately\r\nadvanced to him, and the wild region, which was once a dense forest\r\naround Fort Enterprise, finally became (to Mrs Gore's inexpressible\r\njoy) a flourishing settlement, in which were heard the sounds of human\r\nindustry, and the tinkle of the Sabbath bell.",
