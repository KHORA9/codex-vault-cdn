NEWELL, M.E.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong oil producers, there has been much discussion as to whether the\r\nsand rock in which petroleum occurs is of necessity fissured or is\r\nstill in its original unbroken condition.\r\n\r\nThe earliest and most natural theory, which for years was indisputed,\r\nand is still given by some textbooks, was, that oil wells reached a\r\ncavity filled with petroleum.\r\n\r\nWithin the past few years, however, the opinion has been gaining\r\nground that the oil is stored in the sandrock itself in the minute\r\nspaces between the small grains of sand, not entirely filled by\r\ncementing material, and that crevices holding and conducting oil are\r\nrare, all fissures as a rule being confined to the upper fresh-water\r\nbearing rocks of the well. Mr. Carll, in III. Pennsylvania Second\r\nGeological Survey, has discussed this subject very fully, and has made\r\nestimates of the quantity of oil that the sand rock can hold and\r\ndeliver into a well; also, T. Sterry Hunt, in his _Chemical and\r\nGeological Essays_, has made deductions as to the petroleum contained\r\nin the Niagara limestone that outcrops about Chicago.\r\n\r\nWhile the experiments and conclusions of these geologists go to prove\r\nthat these rocks are capable of holding the oil, there are on record\r\nno facts as to the phenomena of its flow, other than by capillarity,\r\nthrough the rock. To obtain some data of the flow of liquids under\r\npressure through certain oil-bearing stones, series of tests on small\r\npieces were made. These tests were carried on during this spring, and\r\nmany results quite unlooked for were obtained. When crude oil,\r\nkerosene, or water (river or distilled) was forced through the\r\nspecimens, the pressure being constant, the rate of flow was variable.\r\nAt first, the amount flowing through was large, then fell off rapidly,\r\nand when the flow had diminished to about one-quarter of its original\r\nrate, the decrease was very slight, but still continued as long as\r\nmeasurements were made, in some cases for three weeks.\r\n\r\nWhen using crude oil, this result was not surprising, for, as the oil\r\nmen say, crude oil \"paraffines up\" a rock, that is, clogs the minute\r\npores by depositing solid paraffine (?); but this so-called\r\nparaffining took place, not only with crude oil, but with refined oil,\r\nand even with distilled water.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation as yet is, that liquids flowing under pressure\r\nthrough rock on which they exert little or no dissolving effect,\r\ninstead of washing out fine particles, tend to dislodge any minute\r\ngrains of the stone that may not be firmly held by cement, and these\r\nblock up extremely fine and crooked pores in which the fluid is\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nSeveral tests indicated that this blocking up was largely near the\r\nsurface into which the fluid was passing. When this surface was ground\r\noff, even 1/50 of an inch, the flow increased immediately nearly to\r\nthe original rate.\r\n\r\nReversing the flow also had the effect of increasing the rate, even\r\nabove that of any time previous.\r\n\r\nWith the moderate pressures used--from 2\" to 80\" of mercury--the\r\nresults show that the rate of flow, other things being equal, is\r\ndirectly proportional to the pressure.\r\n\r\nThe porosity of rock is not always a criterion of its permeability; a\r\nvery fine grained marble, containing about 0.6 per cent. cell space,\r\ntransmitted water and oil more freely than a shale that would hold 4\r\nper cent. of its bulk of water.\r\n\r\nIf the above conclusions hold on a large scale as on the small, they\r\nmay aid in explaining the diminished flow of oil wells. Not only will\r\nthe flow lessen from reduced gas pressure, but the passages in the\r\nrock become less able to allow the oil to flow through.\r\n\r\nThe increase in flow following the explosion of large shots in a sand\r\nrock may be due not only to fissuring of the rock, but to temporary\r\nreversal of the pressure, the force of the explosive tending to drive\r\nthe oil back for an instant.\r\n\r\nThe large shots now used (up to 200 quarts, or say 660 pounds of\r\nnitroglycerine) must exert some influence of this kind, especially\r\nwhen held down by 500± feet of liquid tamping. In the course of these\r\ntests, it was noticed that fresh water has a more energetic\r\ndisintegrating action on the shales and clay than on salt water.\r\n\r\nThis may furnish a reason for the fact, noticed by the oil men, that\r\nfresh water has a much more injurious effect than salt in clogging a\r\nwell. No oil-bearing sand rock is free from laminæ of shale, and when\r\nfresh water gets down into the sand, the water must, as the\r\nexperiments show, rapidly break up the shale, setting free fine\r\nparticles, which soon are driven along into the minute interstices of\r\nthe sand rock, plastering it up and injuring the well.--_Engineering\r\nand Mining Journal._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROTTO OF GARGAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grotto of Gargas is located in Mount Tibiran about three hundred\r\nyards above the level of the valley, and about two miles southeast of\r\nthe village of Aventignan. Access to it is easy, since a road made by\r\nMr. Borderes in 1884 allows carriages to reach its entrance.\r\n\r\nThis grotto is one of the most beautiful in the Pyrenees, and presents\r\nto the visitor a succession of vast halls with roofs that are curved\r\nlike a dome, or are in the form of an ogive, or are as flat as a\r\nceiling. It is easy to explore these halls, for the floor is covered\r\nwith a thick stalagmitic stratum, and is not irregular as in the\r\nmajority of large caves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--SECTION OF THE GROTTO OF GARGAS.]\r\n\r\nUpon entering through the iron gate at the mouth of the grotto, one\r\nfinds himself in Bear Hall, wherein a strange calcareous concretion\r\noffers the form of the carnivorous animal after which the room is\r\nnamed. This chamber is about 80 feet in width by 98 in length. We\r\nfirst descend a slope formed of earth and debris mostly derived from\r\nthe outside. This slope, in which are cut several steps, rests upon a\r\nhard, compact, and crystalline stalagmitic floor. Upon turning to the\r\nright, we come to the Hall of Columns, the most beautiful of all. Here\r\nthe floor bristles with stalagmites, which in several places are\r\nconnected with the stalactites that depend from the ceiling. This room\r\nis about 50 feet square. After this we reach the Hall of Crevices, 80\r\nfeet square, and this leads to the great Hall of Gargas, which is\r\nabout 328 feet in length by 80, 98, and 105 in width. In certain\r\nplaces enormous fissures in the vault rise to a great height. Some of\r\nthese, shaped like great inverted funnels, are more than 60 yards in\r\nlength. The grotto terminates in the Creeping Hall. As its name\r\nindicates, this part of the cave can only be traversed by lying flat\r\nupon the belly. It gives access to the upper grotto through a narrow\r\nand difficult passage that it would be possible to widen, and which\r\nwould then allow visitors to make their exit by traversing the\r\nbeautiful upper grotto, whose natural entrance is situated 150 yards\r\nabove the present one. This latter was blasted out about thirty years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nUpon following the direction of the great crevices, we reach a small\r\nchamber, wherein are found the Oubliettes of Gargas--a vertical well\r\n65 feet feet in depth. The aperture that gives access to this strange\r\nwell (rendered important through the paleontological remains collected\r\nin it) is no more than two feet in diameter. Such is the general\r\nconfiguration of the grotto.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Dr. Garrigou and Mr. De Chastaignier visited the grotto, and\r\nwere the first to make excavations therein. These latter allowed these\r\nscientists to ascertain that the great chamber contained the remains\r\nof a quaternary fauna, and, near the declivity, a deposit of the\r\nreindeer age.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was possible to obtain a permit from the Municipal\r\nCouncil of Aventignan to do so, I began the work of excavation, and\r\nthe persistence with which I continued my explorations led me to\r\ndiscover one of the most important deposits that we possess in the\r\nchain of the Pyrenees. My first excavations in Bear Hall were made in\r\n1873, and were particularly fruitful in an opening 29 feet long by 10\r\nwide that terminates the hall, to the left. I have remarked that these\r\nsorts of retreats in grottoes are generally rich in bones. Currents of\r\nwater rushing through the entrance to the grotto carry along the\r\nbones--entire, broken, or gnawed--that lie upon the ground. These\r\nremains are transported to the depths of the cave, and are often\r\nstopped along the walls, and lie buried in the chambers in\r\nargillaceous mud. Rounded flint stones are constantly associated with\r\nthe bones, and the latter are always in great disorder. The species\r\nthat I met with were as follows: the great cave bear, the little bear,\r\nthe hyena, the great cat, the rhinoceros, the ox, the horse, and the\r\nstag.\r\n\r\nThe stalagmitic floor is 1½, 2, and 2¼ inches thick. The bones were\r\neither scattered or accumulated at certain points. They were generally\r\nbroken, and often worn and rounded. They appeared to have been rolled\r\nwith violence by the waters. The clay that contained them was from 3\r\nto 6 feet in thickness, and rested upon a stratum of water-worn\r\npebbles whose dimensions varied from the size of the fist to a grain\r\nof sand. A thick layer of very hard, crystalline stalagmite covers the\r\nHall of Columns, and it was very difficult to excavate without\r\ndestroying this part of the grotto.\r\n\r\nI found that there anciently existed several apertures that are now\r\nsealed up, either by calcareous concretions or by earthy rubbish from\r\nthe mountain. One of these was situated in the vicinity of the present\r\nmouth, and permitted of the access to Bear Hall of a host of carnivora\r\nthat found therein a vast and convenient place of shelter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--SKELETON OF THE CAVE HYENA.]\r\n\r\nThese excavations revealed to me at this entrance, at the bottom of\r\nthe declivity, a thick stratum of remains brought thither by primitive\r\nman. This deposit, which was formed of black earth mixed with charcoal\r\nand numerous remains of bones, calcined and broken longitudinally for\r\nthe most part, contained rudely worked flint stones. I collected a few\r\nimplements, one surface of which offered a clean fracture, while the\r\nother represented the cutting edge. According to Mr. De Mortillet,\r\nsuch instruments were not intended to have a handle. They were capable\r\nof serving as paring knives and saws, but they were especially\r\ndesigned for scraping bones and skins. The deposit was from 26 to 32\r\nfeet square and from 2 inches to 5 feet deep, and rested upon a bed of\r\nbroken stones above the stalagmite. The animals found in it were the\r\nmodern bear (rare), the aurochs, the ox, the horse, and the stag--the\r\nlast four in abundance.\r\n\r\nAt the extremity of the grotto there is a well with vertical sides\r\nwhich is no less than 65 feet in depth. It is called the Gargas\r\nOubilettes. Its mouth is from 15 to 24 inches in diameter, and\r\nscarcely gives passage to a man (Fig. 1). Mr. Borderes, in the hope of\r\ndiscovering a new grotto, was the first to descend into this well,\r\nwhich he did by means of a rope ladder, and collected a few bones that\r\nwere a revelation to me. Despite the great difficulty and danger of\r\nexcavating at this point, I proceeded, and found at the first blow of\r\nthe pick that there was here a deposit of the highest importance,\r\nsince all the bones that I met with were intact. The first thing\r\ncollected was an entire skull of the great cave bear, with its\r\nmaxillaries in place. From this moment I began a series of excavations\r\nthat lasted two years.\r\n\r\nThe descent is effected through a narrow vertical passage 6½ feet in\r\nlength. The cavity afterward imperceptibly widens, and, at a depth of\r\n12 yards, reaches 6½ feet in diameter, and at 15 yards 10 feet.\r\nFinally, in the widest part (at a depth of 62 feet) it measures about\r\n16 feet (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nA glance at the section of the well, which I have drawn as accurately\r\nas possible (not an easy thing to do when one is standing upon a rope\r\nladder), will give an idea of the form of this strange pocket formed\r\nin the limestone of the mountain through the most complex dislocations\r\nand erosions. Two lateral pockets attracted my attention because of\r\nthe enormous quantity of clay and bones that obstructed them. The\r\nfirst, to the left, was about 15 feet from the orifice. When we had\r\nentirely emptied it, we found that it communicated with the bottom of\r\nthe well by a narrow passage. An entire skeleton of the great cave\r\nbear had stopped up this narrow passage, and of this, by the aid of a\r\nsmall ladder, we gathered the greater part of the skeleton, the state\r\nof preservation of which was remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe second pocket, which was almost completely filled with clay, and\r\nsituated a little lower than the other, likewise communicated with a\r\nthird cavity that reached the bottom of the well. The clay of these\r\ndifferent pockets contained so large a quantity of bones that we could\r\nhardly use our picks, and the excavation had to be performed with very\r\nshort hooks, and often by hand. In this way I was enabled to remove\r\nthe bones without accident. The lower pocket was dug out first, and\r\nwith extreme care, the bones being hoisted out by means of a basket\r\nattached to a rope. Three or four candles sufficed to give us light.\r\nThe air was heavy and very warm, and, after staying in it for two\r\nhours, it was necessary to come to the surface to breathe. After\r\nextracting the bones from the lower pocket, and when no more clay\r\nremained, we successively dug out the upper ones and threw the earth\r\nto the bottom of the well.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of December, 1884, my excavating was finished. To-day the\r\nOubliettes of Gargas are obstructed with the clay that it was\r\nimpossible to carry elsewhere. The animals that I thus collected in\r\nthe well were the following: The great bear (in abundance), the little\r\nbear (a variety of the preceding), the hyena, and the wolf. The\r\npockets contained nearly entire skeletons of these species. How had\r\nthe animals been able to penetrate this well? It is difficult to admit\r\nthat it was through the aperture that I have mentioned. I endeavored\r\nto ascertain whether there was not another communication with the\r\nGargas grotto, and had the satisfaction of finding a fissure that\r\nended in the cave, and that probably was wider at the epoch at which\r\nthe place served as a lair for the bear and hyena.\r\n\r\nVery old individuals and other adults, and very young animals, were\r\nliving in the grotto, and, being surprised, without power to save\r\nthemselves, by a sudden inundation, reached the bottom of the well\r\nthat we have described. The entire remains of these animals were\r\ncarried along by the water and deposited in the pockets in the rock.\r\nOnce buried in the argillaceous mud, the bones no longer underwent the\r\naction of the running water, and their preservation was thence\r\nsecured.--_F. Regnault, in La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEEP SHAFTS AND DEEP MINING.\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the New York _Sun_, writing from Virginia City,\r\nNevada, describes the progress of the work there on the Combination\r\nshaft of the Comstock lode, the deepest vertical shaft in America, and\r\nthe second deepest in the world. It is being sunk by the Chollar\r\nPotosi, Hale & Norcross, and Savage mining companies; hence its name\r\nof the Combination shaft. This shaft has now reached a perpendicular\r\ndepth of a little over 3,100 feet. There is only one deeper vertical\r\nshaft in the world--the Adalbent shaft of the silver-lead mines of\r\nPrzibram, Bohemia, which at last accounts had reached a depth of 3,280\r\nfeet. The attainment of that depth was made the occasion of a\r\nfestival, which continued three days, and was still further honored by\r\nthe striking off of commemorative medals of the value of a florin\r\neach. There is no record of the beginning of work on this mine at\r\nPrzibram, although its written history goes back to 1527.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago very few mining shafts in the world had reached a\r\ndepth of 2,000 feet. The very deepest at that time was in a\r\nmetalliferous mine in Hanover, which had been carried down 2,900 feet;\r\nbut this was probably not a single perpendicular shaft. Two vertical\r\nshafts near Gilly, in Belgium, are sunk to the depth of 2,847 feet. At\r\nthis point they are connected by a drift, from which an exploring\r\nshaft or winze is sunk to a further depth of 666 feet, and from that\r\nagain was put down a bore hole 49 feet in depth, making the total\r\ndepth reached 3,562 feet. As the bore hole did not reach the seam of\r\ncoal sought for, they returned and resumed operations at the 2,847\r\nlevel. In Europe it is thought worthy of particular note that there\r\nare vertical shafts of the following depths:\r\n\r\n                                                     Feet.\r\n  Eimkert's shaft of the Luganer Coal Mining\r\n          Company, Saxony                            2,653\r\n\r\n  Sampson shaft of the Oberhartz silver mine,\r\n          near St. Andreasberg, Hanover.             2,437\r\n\r\n  The hoisting shaft of the Rosebridge Colliery,\r\n          near Wigan, Lancashire, England.           2,458\r\n\r\n  Shaft of the coal mines of St. Luke, near\r\n          St. Chaumont, France.                      2,253\r\n\r\n  Amelia shaft, Shemnitz, Hungary.                   1,782\r\n\r\n  The No. 1 Camphausen shaft, near Fishbach,\r\n          in the department of the Saarbruck\r\n          Collieries, Prussia.                       1,650\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, taking the mines of the Comstock for a distance of over a\r\nmile--from the Utah on the north to the Alto on the south--there is\r\nhardly a mine that is not down over 2,500 feet, and most of the shafts\r\nare deeper than those mentioned above; while the Union Consolidated\r\nshaft has a vertical depth of 2,900 feet, and the Yellow Jacket a\r\ndepth of 3,030 feet. In his closing argument before the Congressional\r\nCommittee on Mines and Mining in 1872, Adolph Sutro of the Sutro\r\ntunnel said: \"The deepest hole dug by man since the world has existed\r\nis only 2,700 feet deep, and it remains for the youngest nation on\r\nearth to contribute more to science and geology by giving\r\nopportunities of studying the formation of mineral veins at a greater\r\ndepth than has ever been accomplished by any other nation in the\r\nworld.\" Mr. Sutro was of the opinion that the completion of his tunnel\r\nwould enable our leading mining companies to reach a vertical depth of\r\n5,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThis great depth has never yet been attained except in a bore hole or\r\nartesian well. The deepest points to which the crust of the earth has\r\never been penetrated have been by means of such borings in quest of\r\nsalt, coal, or water. A bore hole for salt at Probst Jesar, near\r\nLubtheen, for the Government of Mecklenberg-Schwerin, is down 3,315\r\nfeet, the size of which bore is twelve inches at the top and three\r\ninches at the bottom. A bore hole was put down for the Prussian\r\nGovernment to the depth of 4,183 feet. But in these bore holes the\r\nUnited States leads the world, as there is one near St. Louis, Mo.,\r\nthat is 5,500 feet in depth. Here on the Comstock, in the Union\r\nConsolidated mine, a depth of 3,300 feet has been attained, but not by\r\nmeans of a single vertical shaft. The vertical depth of the shaft is\r\n2,900 feet; the remainder of the depth has been attained by means of\r\nwinzes sunk from drifts. Several long drifts were run at this great\r\ndepth without difficulty as regards ventilation or heat.\r\n\r\nThe combination shaft is situated much further east (in which\r\ndirection the lode dips) than any other on the Comstock. It is 3,000\r\nfeet east of the point where the great vein crops out on the side of\r\nMount Davidson; 2,200 feet east of the old Chollar-Potosi shaft, 1,800\r\nft. east of the old Hale & Norcross (or Fair) shaft, and 2,000 ft.\r\neast of the Savage shaft. Thus, it will be seen it is far out to the\r\nfront in the country toward which the vein is going. The shaft is sunk\r\nin a very hard rock (andesite), every foot of which requires to be\r\nblasted. The opening is about thirty feet in length by ten feet in\r\nwidth. In timbering up this is divided into four different\r\ncompartments, some for the hoisting and some for the pumping\r\nmachinery, thus presenting the appearance at the top of four small\r\nshafts set in a row. Over the shaft stand several large buildings, all\r\nfilled with ponderous machinery.\r\n\r\nThe Sutro drain tunnel (nearly four miles in length) connects with the\r\nshaft at a depth of 1,600 ft., up to which point all the water\r\nencountered below is pumped. The shaft was sunk to the depth of 2,200\r\nft. before more water was encountered than could be hoisted out in the\r\n\"skips\" with the dirt. At the 2,200 level two Cornish pumps, each with\r\ncolumns fifteen inches in diameter, were put in. At the 2,400 level\r\nthe same pumps were used. On this level a drift was run that connected\r\nwith the old Hale & Norcross and Savage shafts, producing a good\r\ncirculation of air both in the shaft and in the mines mentioned. At\r\nthis point, on account of the inflow from the mines consequent upon\r\nconnecting with them by means of the drift, they had more water than\r\nthe Cornish pumps could handle, and introduced the hydraulic pumps,\r\nwhich pumps are run by the pressure of water from the surface through\r\na pipe running down from the top of the shaft, whereas the Cornish\r\npumps are run by huge steam engines.\r\n\r\nBy means of the hydraulic pumps they were enabled to sink the shaft to\r\nthe 2,600 level, and extended the Cornish pumps to that point, where\r\nanother set of hydraulic pumps was put in. They then sunk the shaft to\r\nthe 2,800 level, when they ran another drift westward, and tapped the\r\nvein. The prospects at this depth in the Hale & Norcross and Chollar\r\nmines were so encouraging that the management decided to sink the\r\nshaft to the depth of 3,000 ft. On reaching the 3,000 level, they ran\r\na third drift through to the vein. The distance from the shaft to the\r\neast wall of the vein was found to be only 250 ft. At the depth of\r\n3,000 ft. they put in one of the pair of hydraulic pumps that is to be\r\nset up there. The second pump is now arriving from San Francisco, and\r\nas soon as the several parts are on the ground, it will be at once put\r\nin place alongside its fellow on the 3,000 level. This additional pump\r\nwill increase the capacity from 600,000 to 700,000 gallons in\r\ntwenty-four hours, or about forty-five miners' inches.\r\n\r\nOwing to the excellent showing of ore obtained on the 3,000 level by\r\nthe Hale & Norcross Company, and to the continuation of the ore below\r\nthat level (as shown by a winze sunk in the vein), the management\r\ndetermined to sink the shaft to the vertical depth of 3,200 ft. It is\r\nnow 3,120 ft. deep, and it is safe to say that it will reach the depth\r\nof 3,200 ft. early in September, when it will lack but eighty feet of\r\nbeing as deep as the shaft at Przibram was at the time of the great\r\nfestival. Although the shaft is of great size--about thirty feet by\r\nten feet before the timbers are put in--the workmen lower it at the\r\nrate of about three feet a day, in rock as hard as flint.\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic pump now working at the 3,000 foot level of the shaft is\r\nthe deepest in the world. In Europe the deepest is in a mine in the\r\nHartz Mountains, Germany, which is working at the depth of 2,700 feet.\r\nIt is, however, a small pump not half the size of the one in the\r\nCombination shaft. Although these pumps were first used in Europe,\r\nthose in operation here are far superior in size, and in every other\r\nrespect, to those of the Old World, several valuable improvements\r\nhaving been made in them by the machinists of the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the two Cornish pumps, which lift the water from the\r\n2,900 foot level to the Sutro drain tunnel (at the 1,600 level), is\r\nabout 1,000,000 gallons in twenty-four hours, and the capacity of the\r\npresent hydraulic pumps is 3,500,000 gallons in the same time. They\r\nare now daily pumping, with both hydraulic and Cornish pumps, about\r\n4,000,000 gallons, but could pump at least 500,000 gallons more in\r\ntwenty-four hours than they are now doing. The daily capacity with the\r\nhydraulic pump now coming, and which will be set up as mate to that\r\nnow in operation at the 3,000 foot level, will be 5,200,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nThe water which feeds the pressure pipe of the three sets of hydraulic\r\npumps is brought from near Lake Tahoe, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.\r\nThe distance is about thirty miles, and the greater part of the way\r\nthe water flows through iron pipes, which at one point cross a\r\ndepression 1,720 feet in depth. The pressure pipe takes this water\r\nfrom a tank situated on the eastern slope of Mount Davidson, 3,500\r\nfeet west of the shaft. At the tank this pipe is twelve inches in\r\ndiameter, but is only eight inches where it enters the top of the\r\nshaft. The tank whence the water is taken is 426 feet higher than the\r\ntop of the shaft, therefore the vertical pressure upon the hydraulic\r\npump at the 3,000 foot level is 3,426 feet. The pressure pipe is of\r\nordinary galvanized iron where it receives the water at the tank, but\r\ngradually grows thicker and stronger, and at the 3,000 level it is\r\nconstructed of cast iron, and is 2½ inches in thickness. The pressure\r\nat this point is 1,500 pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of hydraulic mining in California the miners thought\r\nthat with a vertical pressure of 300 feet they could almost tear the\r\nworld to pieces, and not a man among them could have been made to\r\nbelieve that any pipe could be constructed that would withstand a\r\nvertical pressure of 1,000 feet; but we now see that a thickness of\r\ntwo and a half inches of cast iron will sustain a vertical pressure of\r\nover 3,400 feet.\r\n\r\nThere is only one pressure pipe for all the hydraulic pumps. This\r\nextends from the tank on the side of the mountain to the 3,000 foot\r\nlevel. It is tapped at the points where are situated the several sets\r\nof hydraulic pumps. The water from the pressure pipe enters one part\r\nof the pump, where it moves a piston-back and forth, just as the\r\npiston of a steam engine is moved by steam. This water engine moves a\r\npump which not only raises to the surface the water which has been\r\nused as driving power, but also a vast quantity of water from the\r\nshaft, all of which is forced up to the Sutro drain tunnel through\r\nwhat is called a return pipe. Each set of hydraulic pumps has its\r\nreturn pipe; therefore there are three return pipes--one from the\r\n2,400, one from the 2,600, and another from the 3,000 level.\r\n\r\nSome idea may be formed of the great size of these hydraulic engines\r\nwhen it is known that the stations excavated for them at the several\r\nlevels where they are placed are 85 feet long, 28 feet wide, and 12\r\nfeet high. All this space is so filled with machinery that only\r\nsufficient room is left to allow of the workmen moving about it. One\r\nof these stations would, on the surface, form a hall large enough for\r\na ball room, and to those who are unacquainted with the skill of our\r\nminers it must seem wonderful that such great openings can be made and\r\nsecurely supported far down in the bowels of the earth; yet it is very\r\neffectually done. These great subterranean halls are supported by\r\ntimbers 14×16 inches square set along the walls three feet apart, from\r\ncenter to center, and the caps or joists passing overhead are timbers\r\nof the same size. The timber used is mountain spruce. Not one of these\r\nhuge stations has thus far cost one dollar for repairs. The station at\r\nthe 2,400 level has been in use five years, that at the 2,600 three\r\nyears, and the one at the 3,000 level eight months. Room for\r\nventilation is left behind the timbers, and all are still sound.\r\nTimbers of the same kind are used in the shaft, and all are sound. The\r\nshaft has cost nothing for repairs. Being in hard andesite rock from\r\ntop to bottom, the ground does not swell and crowd upon the timbers.\r\n\r\nIf it shall be thought advisable to go to a greater depth than 3,200\r\nfeet, a station of large size will be made on the east side of the\r\npresent shaft, and in this station will be sunk a shaft of smaller\r\nsize. The reason why the work will be continued in this way is that in\r\na single hoist of 3,200 feet the weight of a steel wire cable of that\r\nlength is very great--so great that the loaded cage it brings up is a\r\nmere trifle in comparison. In this secondary shaft the hoisting\r\napparatus and pumps will be run by means of compressed air. As it is\r\nvery expensive to make compressed air by steam power, the pressure\r\npipe will be tapped at the level of the Sutro tunnel, and a stream of\r\nwater taken out that will be used in running a turbine wheel of\r\nsufficient capacity to drive three air compressors. As there will be a\r\nvertical pressure upon the turbine at this depth of over 2,000 feet, a\r\nlarge stream of water will not be required. The water used in driving\r\nthe wheel will flow out through the Sutro tunnel, and give no trouble\r\nin the shaft.\r\n\r\nBy means of this great shaft and its powerful hydraulic and Cornish\r\npumps the crust of the earth will probably yet be penetrated to far\r\ngreater depth than in any other place in the world. It has been only a\r\nlittle over ten years since the work of sinking it was begun, whereas\r\nin the mines of the Old World they have been delving since \"time\r\nwhereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary.\" The work on\r\nthe Combination shaft has been by no means continuous. There have been\r\nlong stoppages aside from those required at such times as they were\r\nengaged in running long drifts to the westward to tap the vein, and at\r\ntimes for many months, when the several companies interested in the\r\nshaft were engaged in prospecting the various levels it had opened up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE WELLS AND CAVERNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYucatan is one of the most interesting States of Mexico, owing to the\r\nsplendid ancient palaces and temples of once grand cities, now hidden\r\nin the forests. That country also presents great attractions for\r\ngeologists and botanists, as well as naturalists, who there find rare\r\nand beautiful birds, insects, and reptiles.\r\n\r\nThere are no rivers on the surface of the land, but in many parts it\r\nis entirely undermined by extensive caverns, in which are basins of\r\nwater fed by subterranean currents. The caverns are delightfully cool\r\neven at midday, and the fantastic forms of some of the stalactites and\r\nstalagmites are a never-ending source of interest. There are long\r\nwinding passages and roomy chambers following one after another for\r\ngreat distances, with here and there some chink in the stony vault\r\nabove, through which a sunbeam penetrates, enabling us to see to the\r\nright and left openings leading to untrodden places in the bowels of\r\nthe earth. As few of these caves have been explored, the wildest\r\naccounts are given by the natives concerning the dark recesses where\r\nonly wild beasts seek shelter. Before venturing far in, it is\r\nadvisable to secure one end of a ball of twine at the entrance, and\r\nkeep the ball in hand; nor is it safe to go without lanterns or\r\ntorches, lest we step into some yawning chasm or deep water. The\r\nleader of one party suddenly saw a very dark spot just before him; he\r\njumped over, instead of stepping on it, and told the others to halt.\r\nExamination proved the dark patch to be a pit that seemed bottomless.\r\n\r\nAwe-inspiring as are the interiors of some of these caves, they are\r\nfrequently most beautiful. The natural pillars are often grand in\r\ndimensions and sparkling with various hues, while stalactites and\r\nstalagmites sometimes resemble familiar objects with astonishing\r\nperfection. It is, however, not advisable to place implicit confidence\r\nin accounts of the natives, for the reality, no matter how beautiful,\r\ncan hardly be equal to what the vivid imagination of the Indian has\r\npictured. Anything bearing the least resemblance to a woman is called\r\n\"a most beautiful Virgin Mary.\" Fantastic flutings become \"an organ,\"\r\nand a level rock \"an altar.\" Only once we were not disappointed, when,\r\nhaving been told to look for a pulpit, we found one that appeared as\r\nif man must have fashioned it, supported on a slender pyramidal base,\r\nthe upper part very symmetrical, and ornamented with a perfect\r\nimitation of bunches of grapes and other fruit.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, in these caves are sheets of water, some very\r\nlarge, others only a few feet in circumference, fed by subterranean\r\ncurrents. When the water is clear and sweet, it is peopled by a kind\r\nof bagre, a blind fish called by the natives _tzau_, also a species of\r\n_Silurus_. But there are likewise medicinal and thermal waters, by\r\nbathing in which many people claim to have been cured of most painful\r\nand obstinate diseases.\r\n\r\nStrange stories are told of some of these waters. Of one it is said\r\nthat those who approach it without holding their breath fall dead.\r\nPeople who live near the place swear it is so, and say the water\r\nappears to boil on such occasions. From the thermal waters, in some\r\ncases 100 feet below the soil, and without means of access except by\r\nbuckets let down through an opening in the rock, warm vapors issue at\r\nearly morn, but when the sun is high the water is cool and pleasant to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nThe name _senote_ is given to all these deposits of water, also to\r\nsome immense natural circular wells from 50 to 300 feet in diameter.\r\nThe walls are more or less perpendicular, generally covered with\r\ntropical vegetation. The current in some is swift, but no inlets or\r\noutlets are visible. The water is deliciously pure and sweet, much\r\nbetter than that of wells opened by man in the same country. These\r\nenormous deposits generally have a rugged path, sometimes very steep,\r\nleading to the water's edge, but daring natives throw themselves from\r\nthe brink, afterward ascending by stout roots that hang like ropes\r\ndown the walls, the trees above sucking through these roots the\r\nlife-sustaining fluid more than a hundred feet below.\r\n\r\nIn the west part of Yucatan is a village called _Bolonchen_ (nine\r\nwells), because in the public square there are nine circular openings\r\ncut through a stratum of rock. They are mouths of one immense cistern,\r\nif natural or made by hand the natives do not know, but in times of\r\ndrought it is empty, which shows that it is not supplied by any\r\nsubterranean spring. Then the people depend entirely on water found in\r\na cave a mile and a half from the village; it is perhaps the most\r\nremarkable cavern in the whole country. The entrance is magnificently\r\nwild and picturesque. It is necessary to carry torches, for the way is\r\ndark and dangerous. After advancing sixty or seventy feet we descend a\r\nstrong but rough ladder twenty feet long, placed against a very\r\nprecipitous rock. Not the faintest glimmer of daylight reaches that\r\nspot; but after a while we stand on the brink of a perpendicular\r\nprecipice, the bottom of which is strongly illuminated through a hole\r\nin the surface rock more than 200 feet above. Standing on the verge of\r\nthis awful pit in the dim light, the rocks and crags seem to take on\r\nmost weird shapes. We go down into the great hole by a ladder eighty\r\nfeet high and twelve wide, and, reaching the bottom, are as yet but at\r\nthe mouth of the cave, which, by the bye, is called _Xtacunbi Xunan_\r\n(the hidden lady), because, say the Indians, a lady was stolen from\r\nher mother and hidden there by her lover. Now, to our right, we find a\r\nnarrow passage, and soon another ladder; the darkness is intense and\r\nthe descent continuous, though irregular, like a series of hills and\r\ndales, ladders being placed against the steepest places.\r\n\r\nAfter an exhausting journey we reach a vast chamber, from which\r\ncrooked passages lead in various directions to wells, seven in all,\r\neach named according to the peculiar kind of water. One, always warm,\r\nis called _Chocohá_ (hot water); another, _O[c]ihá_* (milky water), and\r\n_Akabhá_ (dark water). About 400 paces away from the chamber, passing\r\nthrough a very narrow, close passage, there is a basin of red water\r\nthat ebbs and flows like the sea, receding with the south wind,\r\nincreasing with the northwest.\r\n\r\n   *Transcriber's note: [c] denotes upside-down 'c' in original.\r\n\r\nTo reach the most distant well, we go down yet one more ladder, the\r\nseventh. On one side of it there is a perpendicular wall, on the other\r\na yawning gulf, so when one of the steps, merely round sticks tied\r\nwith withes, gave way beneath our feet, we tightly grasped the stick\r\nabove. Having reached the bottom of the ladder, we crawl on our hands\r\nand feet through a broken, winding passage about 800 feet long, then\r\nsee before us a basin of crystalline water, and how thirsty we are!\r\nThis basin is 1,400 feet from the mouth of the cave, and about 450\r\nfeet below the earth's surface. Several hundred people during five\r\nmonths in every year depend entirely on that source for all the water\r\nthey use. With their frail pitchers and flaring torches they wend\r\ntheir way, gasping for breath, through the intricate passages, and\r\nreaching the water, are so profusely perspiring that they must wait\r\nbefore quenching their thirst. The way back is even harder, and they\r\nare tired and loaded; yet these people are such lovers of cleanliness\r\nthat on their arrival at their poor huts, before tasting food, they\r\nwill use some of the water that has cost them so much, to bathe their\r\nsmoke-begrimed skin. As several women once fainted in the cave, men\r\ngenerally fetch the water now.\r\n\r\nYucatan is, and has been for ages past, quite free from earthquakes,\r\nwhile all surrounding countries are from time to time convulsed. This\r\nimmunity may be due to the vast caverns and numerous great wells\r\nexisting throughout the land. Pliny the Elder was of opinion that if\r\nnumerous deep wells were made in the earth to serve as outlets for the\r\ngases that disturb its upper strata, the strength of the earthquakes\r\nwould be diminished, and if we may judge by Yucatan, Pliny was right\r\nin his conjectures. After him, other scientists who have carefully\r\nstudied the subject have expressed the same opinion with regard to the\r\nefficacy of large wells.\r\n\r\nALICE D.

These tiny eggs are at first quite\r\nwhite or pale yellow, and form an object for the microscope of\r\nremarkable beauty, which is worthy of the examination of all who take\r\nan interest in the garden and its insect life. An egg magnified is\r\ndrawn at the bottom left-hand corner of the woodcut. When the eggs are\r\nnear the hatching point they darken in color, and a magnifying glass\r\nreveals through the delicate transparent shell a sight which fills the\r\nobserver with amazement; the embryo caterpillar is seen in gradual\r\ncourse of formation, and if patience and warmth have permitted it, the\r\nobserver will witness slight movements within the life-case, and\r\npresently the shell will break and a black head with moving jaws will\r\nbe thrust out; the little caterpillar unfolds and slowly crawls away\r\nfrom the egg-shell, and inserts its jaws into the green leaf. It is\r\ncurious to witness how judiciously the little creatures avoid crowding\r\ntogether, but strike out in different directions, and thus they make\r\nsure of a plentiful supply of food, and distribute the effects of\r\ntheir depredations. These caterpillars eat continually, and hence\r\nrapidly increase in size, until they present the appearance shown in\r\nour drawing at the bottom of the illustration, which is a full grown\r\ncaterpillar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CABBAGE AND PEACOCK BUTTERFLIES.]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this insect is composed of thirteen segments\r\nfrom head to tail, which is a distinctive characteristic of all\r\ninsects both in the larval and perfect states; but in the case of this\r\nand most other caterpillars these segments are sharply defined and\r\nreadily recognized. It will also be noticed that the three segments or\r\n\"joints\" nearest the head bear a pair of legs each; these are the real\r\nfeet, or claspers, as they are sometimes termed, which develop into\r\nthe feet of the future butterfly. There are four pairs of false feet\r\nor suckers, which adhere to the ground by suction, and which disappear\r\nin the butterfly. On the last or tail end is a fifth pair of suckers\r\nalso, which can attach themselves to a surface with considerable\r\nforce, as any one can attest who has noticed the wrigglings of one of\r\nthese caterpillars when feeling for new feeding ground.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar now ceases to eat, and quietly betakes itself to a\r\nsecluded corner, where in peace it spins a web around its body, and\r\nwrapt therein remains quiescent, awaiting its change into the\r\nbutterfly. Although so dormant outwardly, activity reigns inside;\r\nprocesses are going on within that chrysalis-case which are the\r\namazement and the puzzle of all naturalists. In course of time the\r\nworm is changed into the beautiful winged butterfly, which breaks its\r\ncase and emerges soft and wet; but it quickly dries and spreads its\r\nwings to commence its life in the air and sunshine. The chrysalis is\r\nrepresented in the figure on the left. The butterfly, it will be\r\nrecognized, is one of the common insects so familiar to all, with\r\nstrongly veined white wings, bearing three black spots, two on the\r\nupper and one on the lower wing, and dark coloring on the corner of\r\nthe upper wings. The antennæ, as with all butterflies, are clubbed at\r\nthe extremity--unlike moths', which are tapering--and the large black\r\nstaring eyes are the optical apparatus, containing, we are told,\r\nthousands of lenses, each a perfect, simple eye.\r\n\r\nThe wings derive their chief coloring from the covering of scales,\r\nwhich lie on like slates on a roof, and are attached in a similar\r\nmanner. A small portion of the wing magnified is represented at the\r\nbottom right hand corner, and detached scales more highly magnified\r\nnext to it, exhibiting somewhat the form of battledoors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACOCK BUTTERFLY.\r\n\r\nAnother well known insect is illustrated in the figure in the upper\r\nportion--the peacock butterfly (Vanessa Io). The curious spiked and\r\nspotted caterpillar feeds upon the common nettle. This beautiful\r\nbutterfly--common in most districts--is brilliantly colored and\r\nfigured on the upper side of the wings, but only of a mottled brown on\r\nthe under surface, somewhat resembling a dried and brown leaf, so that\r\nit is no easy matter to detect the conspicuous, brightly-decked insect\r\nwhen it alights from flight upon foliage, and brings its wings\r\ntogether over its back after the manner of butterflies. At the\r\nleft-hand corner is seen the head of the insect, magnified, showing\r\nthe long spiral tongue.\r\n\r\nThis is a curious structure, and one that will repay the trouble of\r\nmicroscopic examination. In the figure the profile is seen, the large\r\ncompound eye at the side and the long curved tongue, so\r\nelephantine-looking in form, though of minute size, is seen unrolled\r\nas it is when about to be inserted into flowers to pump up the\r\nhoney-juice. This little piece of insect apparatus is a mass of\r\nmuscles and sensitive nerves comprising a machine of greater\r\ncomplexity and of no less precision in its action than the modern\r\nprinting machine. When not in use, the tongue rolls into a spiral and\r\ndisappears under the head. A butterfly's tongue may readily be\r\nunrolled by carefully inserting a pin within the first spiral and\r\ngently drawing it out.--_The Gardeners' Chronicle._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BHOTAN CYPRESS.\r\n\r\n(CUPRESSUS TORULOSA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis cypress, apart from its elegant growth, is interesting as being\r\nthe only species of Cupressus indigenous to India. It is a native of\r\nthe Himalayas in the Bhotan district, and it also occurs on the\r\nborders of Chinese Tartary. It forms, therefore, a connecting link, as\r\nit were, between the true cypresses of the extreme east and those that\r\nare natives of Europe. It is singular to note that this genus of\r\nconifers extends throughout the entire breadth of the northern\r\nhemisphere, Cupressus funebris representing the extreme east in China,\r\nand C. macrocarpa the extreme west on the Californian seacoast. The\r\nnortherly and southerly limits, it is interesting to mark, are, on the\r\ncontrary, singularly restricted, the most southerly being found in\r\nMexico; the most northerly (C. nutkaensis) in Nootka Sound, and the\r\nsubject of these remarks (C. torulosa) in Bhotan. The whole of the\r\nregions intervening between these extreme lateral points have their\r\ncypresses. The European species are C. lusitanica (the cedar of Goa),\r\nwhich inhabits Spain and Portugal; C. sempervirens (the Roman\r\ncypress), which is centered chiefly in the southeasterly parts of\r\nEurope, extending into Asia Minor. Farther eastward C. torulosa is met\r\nwith, and the chain is extended eastward by C. funebris, also known as\r\nC. pendula. The headquarters of the cypresses are undoubtedly in the\r\nextreme west, for here may be found some four or five distinct\r\nspecies, including the well-known C. Lawsoniana, probably the most\r\npopular of all coniferæ in gardens, C. Goveniana, C. Macnabiana, C.\r\nmacrocarpa, and C. nutkaensis (spelt C. nutkanus by the Californian\r\nbotanists). The eastern representative of the cypresses in the United\r\nStates of North America is C. thyoides, popularly known as the white\r\ncedar. In Mexico three or four species occur, so that the genus in\r\nround numbers only contains about a dozen species. The Californian\r\nbotanist Mr. Sereno Watson takes away Lawson's cypress from Cupressus\r\nand puts it in the genus Chamæcyparis, the chief points of distinction\r\nbeing the flattened two-ranked branchlets and the small globose cones\r\nmaturing the first year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONES OF CUPRESSUS TORULOSA (NATURAL SIZE).]\r\n\r\nAll the cypresses are undoubtedly valuable from a garden point of\r\nview, but the various species vary in degree as regards their utility\r\nas ornamental subjects. I should rank them in the following order in\r\npoint of merit: C. Lawsoniana, C. nutkaensis, C. macrocarpa, C.\r\nsempervirens, C. thyoides, C. Macnabiana, and C. Goveniana; then would\r\nfollow C. torulosa, C. funebris, C. Knightiana, and other Mexican\r\nspecies. These are placed last, not because they are less elegant than\r\nthe others, but on account of their tenderness, all being liable to\r\nsuccumb to our damp and cold winters. The species which concerns us at\r\npresent, C. torulosa, is an old introduction, seeds of it having been\r\nsent to this country by Wallich so long back as 1824, and previous to\r\nthis date it was found by Royle on the Himalayas, growing at\r\nelevations of some 11,500 feet above sea level. Coming from such a\r\nheight, one would suppose it to be hardier than it really is, but its\r\ntenderness may probably be accounted for by the wood not getting\r\nthoroughly ripened during our summers. It is a very handsome tree,\r\nsaid to reach from 20 feet to 125 feet in height in its native\r\nhabitat. It has a perfectly straight stem; the growth is pyramidal or\r\nrather conical, and the old wood is of a warm purplish-brown. The\r\nfoliage is a glaucous gray-green, and the branches have a twisted and\r\ntufted appearance.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of it which are, or have been, in\r\ncultivation. Of these one of the best is corneyana, which Gordon\r\nranked as a distinct species. It was supposed to be Chinese, and was\r\nintroduced to cultivation by Messrs. Knight & Perry, the predecessors\r\nof Messrs. Veitch at the Chelsea Nurseries. It differs from C.\r\ntorulosa proper, its habit being of low stature, and has slender\r\npendulous branches; hence, it has been known in gardens by the names\r\nof C. gracilis, C. cernua, and C. pendula. Other varieties of C.\r\ntorulosa are those named in gardens and nurseries--viridis, a kind\r\ndevoid of the glaucous foliage of the original; majestica, a robust\r\nvariety; and nana, a very dwarf and compact-growing sort. There is\r\nalso a so-called variegated form, but it is not worthy of mention. The\r\nsynonyms of C. torulosa itself are C. cashmeriana, C. nepalensis, and\r\nC. pendula. Having regard to the tenderness of this Bhotan cypress, it\r\nshould only be planted in the warmest localities, and in dry sheltered\r\npositions; upland districts, too, provided they are sheltered, are\r\nundoubtedly suitable for it, inasmuch as growth is retarded in spring,\r\nand, therefore, the young shoots escape injury from late spring\r\nfrosts.--_W.G., in The Garden._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PITCHER PLANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe variety of the pitcher plant (_Sarracenia variolaris_) found in\r\nNorth America is carnivorous, being a feeder on various animal\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary Treat, an American naturalist, made, a few years ago,\r\nseveral experiments upon the plants of this species to be found in\r\nFlorida; and to the labors of this lady the writer has been indebted,\r\nin some measure, in the preparation of this paper.\r\n\r\nThe _Sarracenia_ derives its name of \"pitcher plant\" from the fact of\r\nits possessing the following curious characteristics: The median nerve\r\nis prolonged beyond the leaves in the manner of a tendril, and\r\nterminates in a species of cup or urn. This cup is ordinarily three or\r\nfour inches in depth, and one to one and a half inches in width. The\r\norifice of the cup is covered with a lid, which opens and shuts at\r\ncertain periods. At sunrise the cup is found filled with sweet, limpid\r\nwater, at which time the lid is down. In the course of the day the lid\r\nopens, when nearly half the water is evaporated; but during the night\r\nthis loss is made up, and the next morning the cup is again quite\r\nfull, and the lid is shut.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of March the plants put forth their leaves, which are\r\nfrom six to twelve inches long, hollow, and shaped something like a\r\ntrumpet, while the aperture of the apex is formed almost precisely in\r\nthe same manner as those of the plants previously described. A broad\r\nwing extends along one side of the leaf, from the base to the opening\r\nat the top; this wing is bound or edged with a purple cord, which\r\nextends likewise around the cup. This cord secretes a sweet fluid, and\r\nnot only flying insects, but those also that crawl upon the ground,\r\nare attracted by it to the plants. Ants, especially, are very fond of\r\nthis fluid, so that a line of aphides, extending from the base to the\r\nsummit of a leaf, may frequently be observed slowly advancing toward\r\nthe orifice of the cup, down which they disappear, never to return.\r\nFlying insects of every kind are equally drawn to the plant; and\r\ndirectly they taste the fluid, they act very curiously. After feeding\r\nupon the secretions for two or three minutes they become quite stupid,\r\nunsteady on their feet, and while trying to pass their legs over their\r\nwings to clear them, they fall down.\r\n\r\nIt is of no use to liberate any of the smaller insects; every fly,\r\nremoved from the leaf upon which it had been feeding, returned\r\nimmediately it was at liberty to do so, and walked down the fatal cup\r\nas though drawn to it by a species of irresistible fascination.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone that flies and other small insects are overpowered by\r\nthe fluid which exudes from the cord in question. Even large insects\r\nsuccumb to it, although of course not so quickly. Mrs. Treat says: \"A\r\nlarge cockroach was feeding on the secretion of a fresh leaf, which\r\nhad caught but little or no prey. After feeding a short time the\r\ninsect went down the tube so tight that I could not dislodge it, even\r\nwhen turning the leaf upside down and knocking it quite hard. It was\r\nlate in the evening when I observed it enter; the next morning I cut\r\nthe tube open; the cockroach was still alive, but it was covered with\r\na secretion produced from the inner surface of the tube, and its legs\r\nfell off as I extricated it. From all appearance the terrible\r\n_Sarracenia_ was eating its victim alive. And yet, perhaps, I should\r\nnot say 'terrible,' for the plant seems to supply its victims with a\r\nLethe-like draught before devouring them.\"\r\n\r\nIf only a few insects alight upon a leaf, no unpleasant smell is\r\nperceptible during or after the process of digestion; but if a large\r\nnumber of them be caught, which is commonly the case, a most offensive\r\nodor emanates from the cup, although the putrid matter does not appear\r\nto injure in any manner the inner surface of the tube, food, even in\r\nthis condition, being readily absorbed, and going to nourish the\r\nplant. In fact, it would seem that the _Sarracenia_, like some\r\nanimals, can feed upon carrion and thrive upon it.\r\n\r\nIn instances in which experiments have been made with fresh, raw beef\r\nor mutton, the meat has been covered in a few hours with the\r\nsecretions of the leaves, and the blood extracted from it. There is,\r\nhowever, one difference between the digesting powers of the leaves\r\nwhen exercised upon insects or upon meat. Even if the bodies of\r\ninsects have become putrid, the plant, as has already been stated, has\r\nno difficulty in assimilating them; but as regards meat, it is only\r\nwhen it is perfectly sweet that the secretions of the leaves will act\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nThe pitcher plant undoubtedly derives its principal nourishment from\r\nthe insects it eats. It, too--unlike most other carnivorous plants,\r\nwhich, when the quantity of food with which they have to deal is in\r\nexcess of their powers of digestion, succumb to the effort and\r\ndie--appears to find it easy to devour any number of insects, small or\r\nlarge, the operation being with it simply a question of time. Flies,\r\nbeetles, or even cockroaches, at the expiration of three or four days\r\nat most, disappear, nothing being left of them save their wings and\r\nother hard, parts of their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe _Sarracenia_ is, indeed, not only the most voracious of all known\r\nspecies of carnivorous plants, but the least fastidious as to the\r\nnature of the food upon which it feeds.--_W.C.M., Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A PLANT?\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Worsley-Benison has been discussing this question in a very\r\ninteresting way, and he says in conclusion that \"_physiologically_ the\r\nmost distinctive feature of plant-life is the power to manufacture\r\nprotein from less complex bodies; that of animal-life, the absence of\r\nsuch power.\" He finds that in form, in the presence of starch, of\r\nchlorophyl, in power of locomotion, in the presence of circulatory\r\norgans, of the body called nitrogen, in the functions of respiration\r\nand sensation, there are no diagnostic characters. He finds, however,\r\n\"fairly constant and well-marked distinctions\" in the presence of a\r\ncellulose coat in the plant-cell, in digestion followed by absorption,\r\nand in the power to manufacture protein.\r\n\r\nThe _morphological_ feature of plants is this cellulose coat; of\r\nanimals, its absence; the _physiological_ peculiarity of plants, this\r\n_manufacturing power_; of animals, the want of it. But after all the\r\ndiscussion he says: \"To the question, _Is this an animal or a plant?_\r\nwe must often reply, _We do not know_.\"--_The Microscope._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMELLIAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to the rose, no flower* is more beautiful or more useful than the\r\ncamellia. It may readily be so managed that its natural season of\r\nblooming shall be from October to March, thus coming in at a time when\r\nroses can hardly be had without forcing. In every quality, with the\r\nsingle exception of scent, the camellia may be pronounced the equal of\r\nthe rose. It can be used in all combinations or for all purposes for\r\nwhich roses can be employed. In form and color it is probably more\r\nperfect, and fully as brilliant. It is equally or more durable, either\r\non the plant or as a cut flower. It is a little dearer to buy, and\r\nperhaps slightly more difficult to cultivate; but like most plants the\r\ncamellia has crucial periods in its life, when it needs special\r\ntreatment. That given, it may be grown with the utmost ease; that\r\nwithheld, its culture becomes precarious, or a failure. The camellia\r\nis so hardy that it will live in the open air in many parts of Great\r\nBritain, and herein lies a danger to many cultivators. Because it is\r\nquite or almost hardy, they keep it almost cool. This is all very well\r\nif the cool treatment be not carried to extremes, and persisted in all\r\nthe year round. Camellias in a dormant state will live and thrive in\r\nany temperature above the freezing point, and will take little or no\r\nhurt if subjected to from 3°-4° below it, or a temperature of 27°\r\nFahr.\r\n\r\n   * Transcriber's Note: Original \"flour\".\r\n\r\nThey will also bloom freely in a temperature of 40°, though 45° suits\r\nthem better. Hence, during the late summer and early autumn it is\r\nhardly possible to keep camellias too cool either out of doors or in.\r\nThey are also particularly sensitive to heat just before the\r\nflower-buds begin to swell in late autumn or winter; a sudden or\r\nsensible rise of temperature at that stage sends the flower-buds off\r\nin showers. This is what too often happens, in fact, to the camellias\r\nof amateurs. No sooner do the buds begin to show then a natural\r\nimpatience seizes the possessor's of well-budded camellias to have the\r\nflowers opened. More warmth, a closer atmosphere, is brought to bear\r\nupon them, and down fall the buds in showers on stage or floor--the\r\nchief cause of this slip between the buds and the open flowers being a\r\nrise of temperature. A close or arid atmosphere often leads to the\r\nsame results. Camellias can hardly have too free a circulation of air\r\nor too low a temperature. Another frequent cause of buds dropping\r\narises from either too little or too much water at the roots. Either a\r\npaucity or excess of water at the roots should lead to identical\r\nresults. Most amateurs overwater their camellias during their\r\nflowering stages. Seeing so many buds expanding, they naturally rush\r\nto the conclusion that a good deal of water must be used to fill them\r\nto bursting point. But the opening of camellia buds is less a\r\nmanufacture than a mere development, and the strain on the plant and\r\ndrain on the roots is far less during this stage than many suppose. Of\r\ncourse the opposite extreme of over-dry roots must be provided\r\nagainst, else this would also cause the plants to cast off their buds.\r\n\r\nBut our object now is less to point out how buds are to be developed\r\ninto fully expanded flowers than to show how they were to be formed in\r\nplenty, and the plants preserved in robust health year after year. One\r\nof the simplest and surest modes of reaching this desirable end is to\r\nadopt a system of semi-tropical treatment for two months or so after\r\nflowering. The moment or even before the late blooms fade, the plants\r\nshould be pruned if necessary. Few plants bear the knife better than\r\ncamellias, though it is folly to cut them unless they are too tall or\r\ntoo large for their quarters or have grown out of form. As a rule\r\nhealthy camellias produce sufficient or even a redundancy of shoots\r\nwithout cutting back; but should they need pruning, after flowering is\r\nthe best time to perform the operation.\r\n\r\nDuring the breaking of the tender leaves and the growth of the young\r\nshoots in their first stages, the plant should be shaded from direct\r\nsunshine, unless, indeed, they are a long way from the glass, when the\r\ndiffusion and dispersion of the rays of light tone down or break their\r\nscorching force; few young leaves and shoots are more tender and\r\neasily burned than camellia, and scorching not only disfigures the\r\nplants, but also hinders the formation of fine growths and the\r\ndevelopment of flower-buds.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere during the early season of growth may almost touch\r\nsaturation. It must not fail to be genial, and this geniality of the\r\nair must be kept up by the surface-sprinkling of paths, floors,\r\nstages, walls, and the plants themselves at least twice a day.\r\n\r\nWith the pots or border well drained it is hardly possible to\r\noverwater the roots of camellias during their period of wood-making.\r\nThe temperature may range from 50° to 65° during most of the period.\r\nAs the flower-buds form, and become more conspicuous, the tropical\r\ntreatment may become less and less tropical, until the camellias are\r\nsubjected to the common treatment of greenhouse or conservatory plants\r\nin summer. Even at this early stage it is wise to attend to the\r\nthinning of the buds. Many varieties of camellias--notably that most\r\nuseful of all varieties, the double white--will often set and swell\r\nfive or ten times more buds than it ought to be allowed to carry.\r\nNothing is gained, but a good deal is lost, by allowing so many embryo\r\nflower-buds to be formed or partially developed. It is in fact far\r\nwiser to take off the majority of the excess at the earliest possible\r\npoint, so as to concentrate the strength of the plant into those that\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nAs it is, however, often a point of great moment to have a succession\r\nof camellia flowers for as long a period as possible on the same\r\nplants, buds of all sizes should be selected to remain. Fortunately,\r\nit is found in practice that the plants, unless overweighted with\r\nblooms, do not cast off the smaller or later buds in their efforts to\r\nopen their earlier and larger ones. With the setting, thinning, and\r\npartial swelling of the flower-buds the semi-tropical treatment of\r\ncamellias must close; continued longer, the result would be their\r\nblooming out of season, or more probably their not blooming at all.\r\n\r\nThe best place for camellias from the time of setting their\r\nflower-buds to their blooming season is a vexed question, which can\r\nhardly be said to have been settled as yet. They may either be left in\r\na cool greenhouse, or placed in a shaded, sheltered position in the\r\nopen air. Some of the finest camellias ever seen have been placed in\r\nthe open air from June to October. These in some cases have been stood\r\nbehind south, and in others behind west walls. Those facing the east\r\nin their summer quarters were, on the whole, the finest, many of them\r\nbeing truly magnificent plants, not a few of them having been imported\r\ndirect from Florence at a time when camellias were far less grown in\r\nEngland than now.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where camellias are placed in the open air in summer,\r\ncare will be taken to place the pots on worm proof bases, and to\r\nshield the tops from direct sunshine from 10 to 4 o'clock. If these\r\ntwo points are attended to, and also shelter from high winds, it\r\nmatters little where they stand. In all cases it is well to place\r\ncamellias under glass shelter early in October, less for fear of cold\r\nthan of saturating rains causing a sodden state of the soil in the\r\npots.\r\n\r\nWhile adverting, however, to the safety and usefulness of placing\r\ncamellias in the open air in summer, it must not be inferred that this\r\nis essential to the successful culture; it is, in fact, far otherwise,\r\nas the majority of the finest camellias in the country are planted out\r\nin conservatories with immovable roofs. Many such houses are, however,\r\ntreated to special semi-tropical treatment as has been described, and\r\nare kept as cool and open as possible after the flower-buds are fairly\r\nset, so that the cultural and climatic conditions approximate as\r\nclosely as possible to those here indicated.\r\n\r\nSoil and seasons of potting may be described as vexed questions in\r\ncamellia culture. As to the first, some affect pure loam, others peat\r\nonly, yet more a half and half of both, with a liberal proportion of\r\ngritty sand, or a little smashed charcoal or bruised bones as porous\r\nor feeding agents, or both. Most growers prefer the mixture, and as\r\ngood camellias are grown in each of its constituents, it follows\r\nwithout saying that they may also be well grown in various proportions\r\nof both.\r\n\r\nUnder rather than over potting suits the plants best, and the best\r\ntime is doubtless just before they are about to start into fresh\r\ngrowth, though many good cultivators elect to shift their plants in\r\nthe late summer or autumn, that is, soon after the growth is\r\nfinishing, and the flower-buds fairly and fully set for the next\r\nseason. From all which it is obvious that the camellia is not only\r\namong the most useful and showy, but likewise among the most\r\naccommodating of plants.\r\n\r\nUnder good cultivation it is also one of the cleanest, though when\r\nscab gets on it, it is difficult to get rid of it. Mealy-bugs also\r\noccasionally make a hurried visit to camellias when making their\r\ngrowth, as well as aphides. But the leaves once formed and advanced to\r\nsemi-maturity are too hard and leathery for such insects, while they\r\nwill bear scale being rubbed off them with impunity. But really\r\nwell-grown camellias, as a rule, are wholly free from insect pests,\r\nand their clean, dark, glossy leaves are only of secondary beauty to\r\ntheir brilliant, exquisitely formed, and many sized flowers.--_D.T.,\r\nThe Gardeners' Chronicle._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARISÆMA FIMBRIATUM.\r\n\r\n_Mast.; sp. nov._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARISÆMA FIMBRIATUM: LEAF, SPATHE, AND FLORAL DETAILS.]\r\n\r\nSome few years since we had occasion to figure some very remarkable\r\nHimalayan species of this genus, in which the end of the spadix was\r\nprolonged into a very long, thread-like appendage thrown over the\r\nleaves of the plant or of its neighbors, and ultimately reaching the\r\nground, and thus, it is presumed, affording ants and other insects\r\nmeans of access to the flowers, and consequent fertilization. These\r\nspecies were grown by Mr. Elwes, and exhibited by him before the\r\nScientific Committee. The present species is of somewhat similar\r\ncharacter, but is, we believe, new alike to gardens and to science. We\r\nmet with it in the course of the autumn in the nursery of Messrs.\r\nSander, at St. Alban's; but learn that it has since passed into the\r\nhands of Mr. W. Bull, of Chelsea. It was imported accidentally with\r\norchids, probably from the Philippine Islands. It belongs to Engler's\r\nsection, trisecta, having two stalked leaves, each deeply divided into\r\nthree ovate acute glabrous segments. The petioles are long, pale\r\npurplish, rose-colored, sprinkled with small purplish spots. The\r\nspathes are oblong acute or acuminate, convolute at the base,\r\nbrownish-purple, striped longitudinally with narrow whitish bands. The\r\nspadix is cylindrical, slender, terminating in along, whip-like\r\nextremity, much longer than the spathe. The flowers have the\r\narrangement and structure common to the genus, the females being\r\ncrowded at the base of the spadix, the males immediately above them,\r\nand these passing gradually into fleshy incurved processes, which in\r\ntheir turn pass gradually into long, slender, purplish threads,\r\ncovering the whole of the free end of the spadix.--_M.T.M., in The\r\nGardeness' Chronicle._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRIKING A LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the new edition of Mason's \"Burma\" we read that among other uses to\r\nwhich the bamboo is applied, not the least useful is that of producing\r\nfire by friction. For this purpose a joint of thoroughly dry bamboo is\r\nselected, about 1½ inches in diameter, and this joint is then split in\r\nhalves. A ball is now prepared by scraping off shavings from a\r\nperfectly dry bamboo, and this ball being placed on some firm support,\r\nas a fallen log or piece of rock, one of the above halves is held by\r\nits ends firmly down on it, so that the ball of soft fiber is pressed\r\nwith some force against its inner or concave surface. Another man now\r\ntakes a piece of bamboo a foot long or less, and shaped with a blunt\r\nedge, something like a paper knife, and commences a sawing motion\r\nbackward and forward across the horizontal piece of bamboo, and just\r\nover the spot where the ball of soft fiber is held. The motion is slow\r\nat first, and by degrees a groove is formed, which soon deepens as the\r\nmotion increases in quickness. Soon smoke arises, and the motion is\r\nnow made as rapid as possible, and by the time the bamboo is cut\r\nthrough not only smoke but sparks are seen, which soon ignite the\r\nmaterials of which the ball beneath is composed. The first tender\r\nspark is now carefully blown, and when well alight the ball is\r\nwithdrawn, and leaves and other inflammable materials heaped over it,\r\nand a fire secured. This is the only method that I am aware of for\r\nprocuring fire by friction in Burma, but on the hills and out of the\r\nway parts, that philosophical toy, the \"pyrophorus,\" is still in use.\r\nThis consists[1] of a short joint of a thick woody bamboo, neatly cut,\r\nwhich forms a cylinder. At the bottom of this a bit of tinder is\r\nplaced, and a tightly-fitting piston inserted composed of some hard\r\nwood. The tube being now held in one hand, or firmly supported, the\r\npiston is driven violently down on the tinder by a smart blow from the\r\nhand, with the result of igniting the tinder beneath.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: It is also made of a solid cylinder of buffalo's\r\n   horn, with a central hollow of three-sixteenths of an inch in\r\n   diameter and three inches deep burnt into it. The piston, which\r\n   fits very tightly in it, is made of iron-wood or some wood\r\n   equally hard.]\r\n\r\nAnother method of obtaining fire by friction from bamboos is thus\r\ndescribed by Captain T.H. Lewin (\"Hill Tracts of Chittagong, and the\r\nDwellers Therein\", Calcutta, 1869, p. 83), as practiced in the\r\nChittagong Hills. The Tipporahs make use of an ingenious device to\r\nobtain fire; they take a piece of dry bamboo, about a foot long, split\r\nit in half, and on its outer round surface cut a nick, or notch, about\r\nan eighth of an inch broad, circling round the semi-circumference of\r\nthe bamboo, shallow toward the edges, but deepening in the center\r\nuntil a minute slit of about a line in breadth pierces the inner\r\nsurface of the bamboo fire-stick. Then a flexible strip of bamboo is\r\ntaken, about 1½ feet long and an eighth of an inch in breadth, to fit\r\nthe circling notch, or groove, in the fire-stick. This slip or band is\r\nrubbed with fine dry sand, and then passed round the fire-stick, on\r\nwhich the operator stands, a foot on either end. Then the slip,\r\ngrasped firmly, an end in each hand, is pulled steadily back and\r\nforth, increasing gradually in pressure and velocity as the smoke\r\ncomes. By the time the fire-band snaps with the friction there ought\r\nto appear through the slit in the fire-stick some incandescent dust,\r\nand this placed, smouldering as it is, in a nest of dry bamboo\r\nshavings, can be gently blown into a flame.--_The Gardeners'\r\nChronicle._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS IN MEMORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we read how one mediæval saint stood erect in his cell for a week\r\nwithout sleep or food, merely chewing a plantain-leaf out of humility,\r\nso as not to be too perfect; how another remained all night up to his\r\nneck in a pond that was freezing over; and how others still performed\r\nfor the glory of God feats no less tasking to their energies, we are\r\ninclined to think, that, with the gods of yore, the men, too, have\r\ndeparted, and that the earth is handed over to a race whose will has\r\nbecome as feeble as its faith. But we ought not to yield to these\r\ninstigations, by which the evil one tempts us to disparage our own\r\ngeneration.

To most people a north pole expedition would be an easy task\r\ncompared with those ineffably tedious measurements of simple mental\r\nprocesses of which Ernst Heinrich Weber set the fashion some forty\r\nyears ago, and the necessity of extending which in every possible\r\ndirection becomes more and more apparent to students of the mind.\r\nThink of making forty thousand estimates of which is the heavier of\r\ntwo weights, or seventy thousand answers as to whether your skin is\r\ntouched at two points or at one, and then tabulating and\r\nmathematically discussing your results! Insight is to be gained at no\r\nless price than this. The new sort of study of the mind bears the same\r\nrelation to the older psychology that the microscopic anatomy of the\r\nbody does to the anatomy of its visible form, and the one will\r\nundoubtedly be as fruitful and as indispensable as the other.\r\n\r\nDr. Ebbinghaus[1] makes an original addition to heroic psychological\r\nliterature in the little work whose title we have given. For more than\r\ntwo years he has apparently spent a considerable time each day in\r\ncommitting to memory sets of meaningless syllables, and trying to\r\ntrace numerically the laws according to which they were retained or\r\nforgotten. Most of his results, we are sorry to say, add nothing to\r\nour gross experience of the matter. Here, as in the case of the\r\nsaints, heroism seems to be its own reward. But the incidental results\r\nare usually the most pregnant in this department; and two of those\r\nwhich Dr. Ebbinghaus has reached seems to us to amply justify his\r\npains. The first is, that, in _forgetting_ such things as these lists\r\nof syllables, the loss goes on very much more rapidly at first than\r\nlater on. He measured the loss by the number of seconds required to\r\n_relearn_ the list after it had been once learned. Roughly speaking,\r\nif it took a thousand seconds to learn the list, and five hundred to\r\nrelearn it, the loss between the two learnings would have been\r\none-half. Measured in this way, full half of the forgetting seems to\r\noccur within the first half-hour, while only four-fifths is forgotten\r\nat the end of a month. The nature of this result might have been\r\nanticipated, but hardly its numerical proportions.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: \"Ueber das Gedächtniss. Untersuchungen zur\r\n   experimentellen Psychologie.\" Von Herm.\r\n   Ebbinghaus. Leipzig: Duncker u. Humblot, 1885. 10+169 pp. 8vo.]\r\n\r\nThe other important result relates to the question whether ideas are\r\nrecalled only by those that previously came immediately before them,\r\nor whether an idea can possibly recall another idea, with which it was\r\nnever in _immediate_ contact, without passing through the intermediate\r\nmental links. The question is of theoretic importance with regard to\r\nthe way in which the process of \"association of ideas\" must be\r\nconceived; and Dr. Ebbinghaus' attempt is as successful as it is\r\noriginal, in bringing two views, which seem at first sight\r\ninaccessible to proof, to a direct practical test, and giving the\r\nvictory to one of them. His experiments conclusively show that an idea\r\nis not only \"associated\" directly with the one that follows it, and\r\nwith the rest _through that_, but that it is _directly_ associated\r\nwith _all_ that are near it, though in unequal degrees. He first\r\nmeasured the time needed to impress on the memory certain lists of\r\nsyllables, and then the time needed to impress lists of the same\r\nsyllables with gaps between them. Thus, representing the syllables by\r\nnumbers, if the first list was 1, 2, 3, 4 ... 13, 14, 15, 16, the\r\nsecond would be 1, 3, 5 ... 15, 2, 4, 6 ... 16, and so forth, with\r\nmany variations.\r\n\r\nNow, if 1 and 3 in the first list were learned in that order merely by\r\n1 calling up 2, and by 2 calling up 3, leaving out the 2 ought to\r\nleave 1 and 3 with no tie in the mind; and the second list ought to\r\ntake as much time in the learning as if the first list had never been\r\nheard of. If, on the other hand, 1 has a _direct_ influence on 3 as\r\nwell as on 2, that influence should be exerted even when 2 is dropped\r\nout; and a person familiar with the first list ought to learn the\r\nsecond one more rapidly than otherwise he could. This latter case is\r\nwhat actually occurs; and Dr. Ebbinghaus has found that syllables\r\noriginally separated by as many as seven intermediaries still reveal,\r\nby the increased rapidity with which they are learned in order, the\r\nstrength of the tie that the original learning established between\r\nthem, over the heads, so to speak, of all the rest. It may be that\r\nthis particular series of experiments is the entering wedge of a new\r\nmethod of incalculable reach in such questions. The future alone can\r\nshow. Meanwhile, when we add to Dr. Ebbinghaus' \"heroism\" in the\r\npursuit of true averages, his high critical acumen, his modest tone,\r\nand his polished style, it will be seen that we have a new-comer in\r\npsychology from whom the best may be expected.--_W.J., Science._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSINKING OF THE QUIEVRECHAIN WORKING SHAFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sinking of mine shafts in certain Belgian and French basins, where\r\nthe coal deposit is covered with thick strata of watery earth, has\r\nfrom all times been considered as the most troublesome and delicate,\r\nand often the most difficult operation, of the miner's art. Of the few\r\nmodern processes that have been employed for this purpose, that of\r\nMessrs. Kind and Chaudron has been found most satisfactory, although\r\nit leaves much to be desired where it is a question of traversing\r\nmoving sand. An interesting modification of this well-known process\r\nhas recently been described by Mr. E. Chavatte, in the Bulletin de la\r\nSociete Industrielle du Nord de la France. Two years ago the author\r\nhad to sink a working shaft at Quievrechain, 111 feet of which was to\r\ntraverse a mass of moving and flowing sand, inconsistent earth,\r\ngravel, and marls, and proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\nHe first put down two beams, A B (Pl. 1, Figs. 2, 3, and 9), each 82\r\nfeet in length and of 20×20 inch section in the center, and upon these\r\nplaced two others, E F, of 16×16 inch section. Beneath the two first\r\nwere inserted six joists, _c c c c c c_, about 82 feet in length and\r\nof 14 or 16 inch section in the center. Finally these were\r\nstrengthened at their extremities with two others, _d d_, about 82\r\nfeet in length. All these timbers, having been connected by tie bands\r\nand bolts, constituted a rigid structure that covered a surface of\r\nnearly seven hundred square yards.\r\n\r\nFrom the beams, A B and E F, there was suspended a red fir frame by\r\nmeans of thirty-four iron rods.\r\n\r\nUpon this frame, which was entirely immersed in the moving sand, there\r\nwas established brick masonry (Figs. 1, 2, and 3). As the ends of the\r\ntimbers entered the latter, and were connected by 1½ inch bolts, they\r\nconcurred in making the entire affair perfectly solid. The frame, K K,\r\nwas provided with an oaken ring, which was affixed to it with bolts.\r\n\r\nAfter this, a cast iron tubbing, having a cutting edge, and being\r\ncomposed of rings 3.28 feet wide and made of six segments, was\r\nlowered. This tubbing was perfectly tight, all the surfaces of the\r\njoints having been made even and provided with strips of lead\r\none-tenth of an inch thick. It weighed 4,000 pounds to the running\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Section through A B. FIG. 2.--Plan. FIG.\r\n3.--Section through C D. FIG. 5.--Section through E F of Fig. 4. FIGS.\r\n6 AND 7.--Work Prepared and finished. FIG. 10.--Section through A B\r\nand C D of Fig. 12. FIGS. 11 6 AND 12.--Arrangement of jack-screw.\r\nFIG. 13.--Section through A B and C D of Fig. 11.\r\n\r\n               PLATE I.--SINKING A MINE SHAFT.]\r\n\r\nIt was first raised to a height of fifteen feet, so as to cause it to\r\nenter the sand by virtue of its own gravity. It thus penetrated to a\r\ndepth of about twenty inches. After this the workmen were ordered to\r\nman the windlasses and hoist out some of the sand. This caused the\r\ntubbing to descend about eight inches more, when it came to a\r\nstandstill. It was now loaded with 17,000 pounds of pig iron, but in\r\nvain, for it refused to budge. Mr. Chavatte therefore had recourse to\r\na dredge with vertical axis, constructed as follows:\r\n\r\nUpon a square axis, A B (Pl. 2, Figs. 1, 2, and 3), provided with\r\ndouble cross braces, C D, and strengthened by diagonals, were riveted,\r\nby their upper extremities, two cheeks, G H, whose lower extremities\r\nheld the steel plates, I J I' J', which, in turn, were fastened to the\r\naxis, A B, by their other extremities. These plates were so inclined\r\nas to scrape the surface of the ground over which they were moved.\r\nThey each carried two bags made of coarse canvas and strengthened by\r\nfive strong leather straps (Figs. 2 and 4). To the steel plates were\r\nriveted two plates of iron containing numerous apertures, through\r\nwhich passed leather straps designed for fastening thereto the lower\r\npart of the mouth of the bags. That portion of the mouth of the latter\r\nthat was to remain open was fastened in the same way to two other\r\nplates, X Y, X¹ Y¹ (Fig. 1), held between the lower cross-braces.\r\n\r\nWhen the apparatus was revolved, the plates scraped the earth to be\r\nremoved, and descended in measure as the latter entered the bags.\r\nThese bags, when full, were hooked, by means of the five rings which\r\nthey carried, to the device shown in Fig. 8 (Pl. 2), and raised to the\r\nsurface and emptied into cars.\r\n\r\nThe dredge was set in motion by four oak levers (Figs. 5 and 6). Two\r\nof these were manned by workmen stationed upon the surface flooring,\r\nand the other two by workmen upon the flooring in the tubbing. The\r\naxis was elongated, in measure as the apparatus descended, by rods of\r\nthe same dimensions fastened together by cast iron sleeves and bolts\r\n(Fig. 7).\r\n\r\nThe steel plates were not capable of acting alone, even in cases where\r\nthey operated in pure moving sand containing no pebbles, for the sand\r\nwas too compact to be easily scraped up by the steel, and so it had to\r\nbe previously divided. For this purpose Mr. Chavatte used rakes which\r\nwere in form exactly like those of the extirpators, U and V, of Figs.\r\n1, 2, and 3, of Pl. 2, except that the dividers carried teeth that\r\nwere not so strong as those of the extirpators, and that were set\r\ncloser together. These rakes were let down and drawn up at will. They\r\nwere maneuvered as follows:\r\n\r\nThe dredge descended with the extirpators pointing upward. When their\r\nheads reached the level of the upper floor, the tools were removed.\r\nThen the dredge was raised again. In this way the extirpators lay upon\r\nthe floor, and, if the lifting was continued, they placed themselves\r\nin their working position, in which they were fixed by the bolts A\" B\"\r\nC\" (Fig. 1). After this, the apparatus was let down and revolved. The\r\nrakes divided the earth, the scrapers collected it, and the bags\r\npocketed it.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty was to cause the tubbing to descend vertically,\r\nand also to overcome the enormous lateral pressure exerted upon it by\r\nthe earth that was being traversed. Water put into the shaft helped\r\nsomewhat, but the great stress to be exerted had to be effected by\r\nmeans of powerful jack screws. These were placed directly upon the\r\ntubbing, and bore against strong beams whose extremities were inserted\r\ninto the masonry.\r\n\r\nAs a usual thing it is not easy to use more than four or six such\r\njacks, since the number of beams that can be employed is limited,\r\nowing to the danger of obstructing the mouth of the shaft. Yet twelve\r\nwere used by Mr. Chavatte, and this number might have been doubled had\r\nit been necessary. As we have seen, the frame, K K (Pl. 1, Fig. 3),\r\nwas provided with an oak circle traversed by 32 bolts. The length of\r\nthese latter was two inches and a quarter longer than they needed to\r\nhave been, or they were provided with wooden collars of that\r\nthickness. Later on, these collars were replaced with iron bars that\r\nheld the wood against which the jacks bore in order to press the\r\ntubbing downward (Pl. 1, Figs. 10, 11, 12, and 13).\r\n\r\nMr. Chavatte's great anxiety was to know whether he should succeed in\r\ncausing the first section of tubbing to traverse the four feet of\r\ngravel; for in case it did not pass, he would be obliged to employ a\r\nsecond section of smaller diameter, thus increasing the expense. He\r\nwas persuaded that the coarse gravel remaining in the side of the\r\nshaft would greatly retard the descent of the tubbing. So he had\r\ndecided to remove such obstructions at the proper moment through\r\ndivers or a diving bell. Then an idea occurred to him that dispensed\r\nwith all that trouble, and allowed him to continue with the first\r\nsection. This was to place upon the dredge two claw-bars, T (Pl. 2,\r\nFig. 3), which effected the operation of widening with wonderful ease.\r\nTo do this it was only necessary to turn up the bags, and revolve the\r\napparatus during its descent. The claw at the extremity of the bar\r\npulled out everything within its reach, and thus made an absolutely\r\nfree passage for the tubbing.\r\n\r\nThe sands and gravels were passed by means of a single section of\r\ntubbing 31 feet in length, which was not stopped until it had\r\npenetrated a stratum of white chalk to a depth of two yards. This\r\nchalk had no consistency, although it contained thin plates of quite\r\nlarge dimensions. These were cut, as if with a punch, by means of the\r\nteeth of the extirpator.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to say a few words concerning the sinking of the shaft,\r\nwhich, after the operation of the dredge, was continued by the process\r\ncalled \"natural level\" The work was not easy until a depth of 111 feet\r\nhad been reached. Up to this point it had been necessary to proceed\r\nwith great prudence, and retain the shifting earth by means of four\r\niron plate tubes weighing 54 tons. Before finding a means of widening\r\nthe work already done by the dredge, Mr. Chavatte was certain that he\r\nwould have to use two sections of tubbing, and so had given the first\r\nsection a diameter of 16½ feet. He could then greatly reduce the\r\ndiameter, and bring it to 15¾ feet as soon as the ground auger was\r\nused.\r\n\r\nAfter two yards of soil had been removed from beneath the edge of the\r\ntubbing, the earth began to give way. Seeing this, Mr. Chavatte let\r\ndown a tube 13 feet in length and 15.4 in diameter. The exterior of\r\nthis was provided with 12 oak guides, which sliding over the surface\r\nof the tubbing had the effect of causing the tube to descend\r\nvertically. And this was necessary, because this tube had to be driven\r\ndown every time an excavation of half a yard had been made.\r\n\r\nAfterward, a diameter of 15.35 feet was proceeded with, and the small\r\ncentral shaft of 4¼ feet diameter was begun. This latter had not as\r\nyet been sunk, for fear of causing a fall of the earth.\r\n\r\nNext, the earth was excavated to a depth of 8.2 feet, and a tube 16.4\r\nfeet in length was inserted; then a further excavation of 8.2 feet was\r\nmade, and the tube driven home.\r\n\r\nAfter this an excavation of 26¼ feet was made, and a tube of the same\r\nlength and 14½ feet in diameter was driven down. Finally, the shifting\r\nsoil was finished with a fourth tube 19½ feet in length and 14 feet in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nA depth of 111 feet had now been reached, and the material encountered\r\nwas solid white chalk. From this point the work proceeded with a\r\ndiameter of 13.9 feet to a depth of 450 feet. The small shaft had been\r\nsunk directly to a depth of 475 feet. At 450 feet the diameter was\r\ndiminished by three inches. Then an advance of a foot was made, and\r\nthe diameter reduced by one and a half inch.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this reduction in the diameter and change in the mode\r\nof deepening was as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Chaudron moss-box, when it chances to reach its seat intact, and\r\ncan consequently operate well, undoubtedly makes a good wedging. But\r\nhow many times does it not happen that it gets injured before reaching\r\nits destination? Besides, as it often rests upon earth that has caved\r\nin upon its seat during the descent of the tubbing, it gets askew, and\r\nlater on has to be raised on one side by means of jacks or other\r\napparatus. Under such circumstances, Mr. Chavatte considered this\r\nmoss-box as more detrimental than useful, and not at all\r\nindispensable, and so substituted beton for it, as had previously been\r\ndone by Mr. Bourg, director of the Bois-du-Luc coal mines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 1, 2, 3, 6 AND 4.--Details of dredge. FIGS. 5 6\r\nAND 6.--Details of maneuvering lever. FIG. 7.--Mode of lengthening the\r\naxis of the dredge. FIG. 8.--Hooks for lifting the dredge bags. FIG.\r\n9.--Arrangement of valves in the beton box. FIG. 10.--Device for\r\ncentering the tubbing.\r\n\r\n               PLATE II.]\r\n\r\nThis engineer likewise suppressed the balancing column, which is often\r\na source of trouble in the descent of the tubbing, and forced his\r\ntubbing to center itself with the shaft through a guide with four\r\nbranches riveted under the false bottom that entered the small shaft\r\n(Pl. 2, Fig. 10). Mr. Bourg so managed that there remained an empty\r\nspace of ten inches to fill in with beton. Mr. Chavatte had at first\r\nintended to proceed in the same way, but the two last tubbings, upon\r\nwhich he had not counted, forced him to reduce the space to 5¾ inches.\r\nUnder such circumstances it was not prudent to employ the same means\r\nfor guiding the base of the tubbing, because, if the central shaft had\r\nnot exactly the same center as the large one, there would have been\r\ndanger of throwing the tubbing sideways and causing it to leak. Seeing\r\nwhich, Mr. Chavatte strengthened the lower part of the base ring and\r\nplaced it upon another ring tapering downward, and 27½ inches in\r\nheight (Pl. 1, Fig. 5). The object of this lower ring was to force the\r\ntubbing to remain concentric with the shaft, to form a tight joint\r\nwith its upper conical portion, and to form a joint upon the seat with\r\nits lower flange, so as to prevent the beton from flowing into the\r\nsmall shaft.\r\n\r\nAfter the shaft was pumped out, digging by hand was begun with a\r\ndiameter of 12 feet. After descending 20 inches an 8×10 inch curb was\r\nlaid, in order to consolidate the earth and prevent any movement of\r\nthe tubbing. Then the excavating was continued to a depth of 31½\r\ninches, and with a diameter of 9¾ feet. At this point another curb was\r\nput in for consolidating the earth. Finally, the bottom was widened\r\nout as shown in Fig. 7, so that three basal wedged curbs could be put\r\nin. This done, the false tubbing was put in place; and finally, when\r\nproceeding upward, the last ring composed of twelve pieces was\r\nreached, the earth was excavated and at once replaced with a collar\r\ncomposed of twelve pieces of oak tightened up by oak wedges. Each of\r\nthese pieces was cemented separately and in measure as they were\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nThrough motive of economy no masonry was placed under the base of the\r\nthree wedged curbs. In fact, by replacing this with a wedged curb of\r\nwood traversed by six bolts designed to fix the cast iron curb\r\nimmediately above, Mr. Chavatte obtained a third curb that he would\r\nhave had to have made of cast iron.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF THE GAS-ENGINE.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: A paper read before the Gas Institute, Manchester,\r\n   June, 1885.]\r\n\r\nBy DENNY LANE, of Cork.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the most useful inventions of the latter half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury the gas-engine holds a prominent place. While its development\r\nhas not been so brilliant or so startling as that which we can note in\r\nthe employment of electricity, it holds, among the applications of\r\nheat, the most important place of any invention made within that\r\nperiod. Even amid the contrivances by which, in recent times, the\r\nother forces of nature have been subdued to the uses of man, there are\r\nonly a few which rival the gas-engine in practical importance. With\r\nregard to the steam-engine itself, it is remarkable how little that is\r\nnew has really been invented since the time of Watt and Woulfe. In the\r\nspecifications of the former can be shown completely delineated, or\r\nfully foreshadowed, nearly every essential condition of the economy\r\nand efficiency attained in our own days; and it is only by a gradual\r\n\"survival of the fittest\" of the many contrivances which were made to\r\ncarry out his broad ideas that the steam-engine of the present has\r\nattained its great economy.\r\n\r\nIt is but within the last fifty years that the laws of the relation\r\nbetween the different physical forces were first enunciated by Justice\r\nGrove, and confirmed by the classical researches of Dr. Joule--the one\r\na lawyer, working hard at his profession, the other a man of business\r\nengaged in manufacture. Both are still living among us; the latter\r\nhaving withdrawn from business, while the former is a Judge of the\r\nHigh Court of Justice. I always regret that the claims of his\r\nprofession have weaned Justice Grove from science; for, while it may\r\nbe possible to find in the ranks of the Bar many who might worthily\r\noccupy his place on the Bench, it would be hard to find among men of\r\nscience any with as wide-reaching and practical philosophy as that\r\nwhich he owns. The chemist demonstrated long since that it was\r\nimpossible for man to create or destroy a single particle of\r\nponderable matter; but it remained for our own time to prove that it\r\nwas equally impossible to create or destroy any of the energy which\r\nexisted in nature as heat, mechanical power, electricity, or chemical\r\naffinity. All that it is in the power of man to do is to convert one\r\nof these forms into another. This, perhaps the greatest of all\r\nscientific discoveries since the time of Newton, was first, I believe,\r\nenunciated in 1842 by Grove, in a lecture given at the London\r\nInstitution; and it was experimentally proved by the researches of\r\nJoule, described in a paper which he read at the meeting of the\r\nBritish Association which was held at Cork--my native city--in 1843.\r\nMy friend Dr. Sullivan, now President of Queen's College, Cork, and I\r\nmyself had the privilege of being two of a select audience of half a\r\ndozen people, who alone took sufficient interest in the subject to\r\nhear for the first time developed the experimental proof of the theory\r\nwhich welds into one coherent system the whole physical forces of the\r\nuniverse, and enables one of these to be measured by another. One\r\nbranch of the \"correlation of physical forces,\" as it was termed by\r\nGrove, was the relation between mechanical power and heat, and the\r\nconvertibility of each into the other, which, under the name of\r\n\"Thermodynamics,\" has become one of the most important branches of\r\npractical science.\r\n\r\nJoule's first experiments clearly proved that each of these forms of\r\nenergy was convertible into the other; but some discrepancies arose in\r\ndetermining the exact equivalent of each. His subsequent researches,\r\nhowever, clearly demonstrated the true relation between both. Taking\r\nas the unit of heat the amount which would be necessary to raise 1 lb.\r\nof water 1° of Fahrenheit's scale (now called \"the English thermal\r\nunit\"), he proved that this unit was equivalent to the mechanical\r\npower which would be required to raise 772 lb. 1 foot, or to raise 1\r\nlb. 772 ft. perpendicularly against the force of gravity. The\r\nheat-unit--the pound-degree--which I will distinguish by the Greek\r\nletter [theta], is a compound unit of mass and temperature; the\r\nsecond--the foot-pound = f.p.--a compound unit of mass and space. This\r\nequation, called \"Joule's equivalent,\" or 1 thermal unit = 772\r\nfoot-pounds, is the foundation and the corner-stone of thermodynamics.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to understand the meaning of this equation. It\r\nexpresses the maximum effect of the given cause, viz., that if _all_\r\nthe heat were converted into power, or _all_ the power were converted\r\ninto heat, 1 thermal unit would produce 772 foot-pounds, or 772\r\nfoot-pounds would raise 1 lb. of water 1° Fahr. But there is never a\r\ncomplete conversion of any form of energy. Common solid coal may be\r\npartly converted into gases in a retort; but some of the carbon\r\nremains unchanged, and more is dissipated but not lost. In the same\r\nway, if I take five sovereigns to Paris and convert them into francs,\r\nand return to London and convert the francs into shillings, I shall\r\nnot have 100 shillings, but only perhaps 95 shillings. But the five\r\nshillings have not been lost; three of them remain in the French\r\n_change de monnaies_, and two of them in the English exchange office.\r\nI may have forfeited something, but the world has forfeited nothing.\r\nThere remains in it exactly the same number of sovereigns, francs, and\r\nshillings as there was before I set out on my travels. Nothing has\r\nbeen lost, but some of my money has been \"dissipated;\" and the\r\nanalogous case, \"the dissipation of energy,\" has formed the subject of\r\nmore than one learned essay.\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of the steam-engine, the only powers employed in\r\nmechanics were those of wind and water mills, and animal power. In the\r\nfirst two, no conversion of one force into another took place; they\r\nwere mere kinematic devices for employing the mechanical force already\r\nexisting in the gale of wind and the head of water. With regard to the\r\npower developed by man and other animals, we had in them examples of\r\nmost efficient heat-engines, converting into power a large percentage\r\nof the fuel burnt in the lungs. But animal power is small in amount,\r\nand it is expensive for two reasons--first, because the agents require\r\nlong intervals of rest, during which they still burn fuel; and next,\r\nbecause the fuel they require is very expensive. A pound of bread or\r\nbeef, or oats or beans, costs a great deal more than a pound of coal;\r\nwhile it does not, by its combustion, generate nearly so much heat.\r\nThe steam-engine, therefore, took the place of animal power, and for a\r\nlong time stood alone; and nearly all the motive power derived from\r\nheat is still produced by the mechanism which Watt brought to such\r\ngreat efficiency in so short a time.\r\n\r\nNow the practical question for all designers and employers of\r\nheat-engines is to determine how the greatest quantity of motive force\r\ncan be developed from the heat evolved from a given kind of fuel; and\r\ncoal being the cheapest of all, we will see what are the results\r\nobtainable from it by the steam-engine. In this we have three\r\nefficiencies to consider--those of the furnace, the boiler, and the\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\nFirst, with respect to the furnace. The object is to combine the\r\ncarbon and the hydrogen of the coal with a sufficient quantity of the\r\noxygen of the air to effect complete combustion into carbonic acid and\r\nwater. In order to do this, we have to use a quantity of air much\r\nlarger than is theoretically necessary, and also to heat an amount of\r\ninert nitrogen five times greater than the necessary oxygen; and we\r\nare therefore obliged to create a draught which carries away to the\r\nchimney a considerable portion of the heat developed. The combustion,\r\nmoreover, is never perfect; and some heat is lost by conduction and\r\nradiation. The principal loss is by hot gases escaping from the flues\r\nto the chimney. Even with well-set boilers, the temperature in the\r\nchimney varies from 400° to 600° Fahr. Taking the mean of 500°, this\r\nwould represent a large proportion of the total heat, even if the\r\ncombustion were perfect; for, as a general rule, the supply of air to\r\na furnace is double that which is theoretically necessary. For our\r\npresent purpose, it will be sufficient to see how much the whole loss\r\nis, without dividing it under the several heads of \"imperfect\r\ncombustion,\" \"radiation,\" and \"convection,\" by the heated gases\r\npassing to the chimney.\r\n\r\nWith a very good boiler and furnace each pound of coal evaporates 10\r\npounds of water from 62° Fahr., changing it into steam of 65 lb.\r\npressure at a temperature of 312°, or 250° above that of the water\r\nfrom which it is generated. Besides these 250°, each pound of steam\r\ncontains 894 units of latent heat, or 1,144 units in all. A very good\r\ncondensing engine will work with 2.2 lb. of coal and 22 lb. of steam\r\nper horse power per hour. Now. 1 lb. of good coal will, by its\r\ncombustion, produce 14,000 heat-units; and the 2.2 lb. of coal\r\nmultiplied by 14,000 represent 30,800[theta]. Of these we find in the\r\nboiler 22 × 1,144, or 25,168 units, or about 81½ per cent., of the\r\nwhole heat of combustion; so that the difference (5,632 units, or 18½\r\nper cent.) has been lost by imperfect combustion, radiation, or\r\nconvection. The water required for condensing this quantity of steam\r\nis 550 lb.; and, taking the temperature in the hot well as 102°, 550\r\nlb. have been raised 40° from 62°. Thus we account for 550 × 40 =\r\n22,000, or (say) 71½ per cent. still remaining as heat. If we add this\r\n71½ per cent. to 18½ per cent. we have 90 per cent., and there remain\r\nonly 10 per cent. of the heat that can possibly have been converted\r\ninto power. But some of this has been lost by radiation from\r\nsteam-pipes, cylinder, etc. Allowing but 1 per cent. for this, we have\r\nonly 9 per cent. as the efficiency of a really good condensing engine.\r\nThis estimate agrees very closely with the actual result; for the 2.2\r\nlb. of coal would develop 30,800[theta]; and this, multiplied by\r\nJoule's equivalent, amounts to nearly 24 millions of foot-pounds. As 1\r\nhorse power is a little less than 2 million foot-pounds per hour, only\r\none-twelfth, or a little more than 8 per cent. of the total heat is\r\nconverted; so that whether we look at the total quantity of heat which\r\nwe show unconverted, or the total heat converted, we find that each\r\nsupplements and corroborates the other. If we take the efficiency of\r\nthe engine alone, without considering the loss caused by the boiler,\r\nwe find that the 25,168[theta] which entered the boiler should have\r\ngiven 19,429,696 foot-pounds; so that the 2 millions given by the\r\nengine represent about 10 per cent. of the heat which has left the\r\nboiler. The foregoing figures refer to large stationary or marine\r\nengines, with first-rate boilers. When, however, we come to\r\nhigh-pressure engines of the best type, the consumption of coal is\r\ntwice as much; and for those of any ordinary type it is usual to\r\ncalculate 1 cubic foot, or 62½ lb., of water evaporated per horse\r\npower. This would reduce the efficiency to about 6 per cent. for the\r\nbest, and 3 per cent. for the ordinary non-condensing engines; and if\r\nto this we add the inefficiency of some boilers, it is certain that\r\nmany small engines do not convert into power more than 2 per cent. of\r\nthe potential energy contained in the coal.\r\n\r\nAt one time the steam-engine was threatened with serious rivalry by\r\nthe hot-air engine. About the year 1816 the Rev. Mr. Stirling, a\r\nScotch clergyman, invented one which a member of this Institute (Mr.\r\nGeorge Anderson) remembers to have seen still at work at Dundee. The\r\nprinciple of it was that a quantity of air under pressure was moved by\r\na mass, called a \"displacer,\" from the cold to the hot end of a large\r\nvessel which was heated by a fire beneath and cooled by a current of\r\nwater above. The same air was alternately heated and cooled, expanded\r\nand contracted; and by the difference of pressure moved the piston in\r\na working cylinder. In this arrangement the furnace was inefficient.\r\nAs only a small portion of heat reached the compressed air, the loss\r\nby radiation was very great, and the wear and tear exceedingly heavy.\r\nThis system, with some modifications, was revived by Rankine,\r\nEricsson, Laubereau, Ryder, Buckett, and Bailey. Siemens employed a\r\nsimilar system, only substituting steam for air. Another system,\r\noriginally proposed by Sir George Cayley, consisted in compressing by\r\na pump cold air which was subsequently passed partly through a\r\nfurnace, and, expanding, moved a larger piston at the same pressure;\r\nand the difference of the areas of the pistons multiplied by the\r\npressure common to both represented the indicated power. This\r\nprinciple was subsequently developed by a very able mechanic, Mr.\r\nWenham; but his engine never came much into favor. The only hot-air\r\nengines at present in use are Ryder's, Buckett's, and Bailey's,\r\nemployed to a limited extent for small powers. I have not said\r\nanything of the thermal principles involved in the construction of\r\nthese engines, as they are precisely the same as those affecting the\r\nsubject of the present paper.\r\n\r\nBefore explaining the principle upon which the gas-engine and every\r\nother hot-air engine depends, I shall remind you of a few data with\r\nwhich most of you are already familiar. The volume of every gas\r\nincreases with the temperature; and this increase was the basis of the\r\nair thermometer--the first ever used. It is to be regretted that it\r\nwas not the foundation of all others; for it is based on a physical\r\nprinciple universally applicable. Although the volume increases with\r\nthe temperature, it does not increase in proportion to the degrees of\r\nany ordinary scale, but much more slowly. Now, if to each of the terms\r\nof an arithmetical series we add the same number, the new series so\r\nformed increases or decreases more slowly than the original; and it\r\nwas discovered that, by adding 461 to the degrees of Fahrenheit's\r\nscale, the new scale so formed represented exactly the increment of\r\nvolume caused by increase of temperature. This scale, proposed by Sir\r\nW. Thomson in 1848, is called the \"scale of absolute temperature.\" Its\r\nzero, called the \"absolute zero,\" is 461° below the zero of\r\nFahrenheit, or 493° below the freezing point of water; and the degree\r\nof heat measured by it is termed the \"absolute temperature.\" It is\r\noften convenient to refer to 39° Fahr. (which happens to be the point\r\nat which water attains its maximum density), as this is the same as\r\n500° absolute; for, counting from this datum level, a volume of air\r\nexpands exactly 1 per cent. for 5°, and would be doubled at 1,000°\r\nabsolute, or 539° Fahr.\r\n\r\nWhenever any body is compressed, its specific heat is diminished; and\r\nthe surplus portion is, as it were, pushed out of the body--appearing\r\nas sensible heat. And whenever any body is expanded, its specific heat\r\nis increased; and the additional quantity of heat requisite is, as it\r\nwere, sucked in from surrounding bodies--so producing cold. This\r\naction may be compared to that of a wet sponge from which, when\r\ncompressed, a portion of the water is forced out, and when the sponge\r\nis allowed to expand, the water is drawn back. This effect is\r\nmanifested by the increase of temperature in air-compressing machines,\r\nand the cold produced by allowing or forcing air to expand in\r\nair-cooling machines. At 39° Fahr., 1 lb. of air measures 12½ cubic\r\nfeet. Let us suppose that 1 lb. of air at 39° Fahr. = 500° absolute,\r\nis contained in a non-conducting cylinder of 1 foot area and 12½ feet\r\ndeep under a counterpoised piston. The pressure of the atmosphere on\r\nthe piston = 144 square inches × 14.7 lb., or 2,116 lb. If the air be\r\nnow heated up to 539° Fahr. = 1,000° absolute, and at the same time\r\nthe piston is not allowed to move, the pressure is doubled; and when\r\nthe piston is released, it would rise 12½ feet, provided that the\r\ntemperature remained constant, and the indicator would describe a\r\nhyperbolic curve (called an \"isothermal\") because the temperature\r\nwould have remained equal throughout. But, in fact, the temperature is\r\nlowered, because expansion has taken place, and the indicator curve\r\nwhich would then be described is called an \"adiabatic curve,\" which is\r\nmore inclined to the horizontal line when the volumes are represented\r\nby horizontal and the pressures by vertical co-ordinates. In this case\r\nit is supposed that there is no conduction or transmission (diabasis)\r\nof heat through the sides of the containing vessel. If, however, an\r\n_additional_ quantity of heat be communicated to the air, so as to\r\nmaintain the temperature at 1,000° absolute, the piston will rise\r\nuntil it is 12½ feet above its original position, and the indicator\r\nwill describe an isothermal curve. Now mark the difference. When the\r\npiston was fixed, only a heating effect resulted; but when the piston\r\nmoved up 12½ feet, not only a heating but a mechanical, in fact, a\r\nthermodynamic, effect was produced, for the weight of the atmosphere\r\n(2,116 lb.) was lifted 12½ feet = 26,450 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nThe specific heat of air at constant pressure has been proved by the\r\nexperiments of Regnault to be 0.2378, or something less than\r\none-fourth of that of water--a result arrived at by Rankine from\r\ntotally different data. In the case we have taken, there have been\r\nexpended 500 × 0.2378, or (say) 118.9[theta] to produce 26,450 f.p.\r\nEach unit has therefore produced (26,450 / 118.0) = 222.5 f.p.,\r\ninstead of 772 f.p., which would have been rendered if every unit had\r\nbeen converted into power. We therefore conclude that (222.5 / 772) = 29\r\nper cent. of the total heat has been converted. The residue, or 71 per\r\ncent., remains unchanged as heat, and may be partly saved by a\r\nregenerator, or applied to other purposes for which a moderate heat is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of heat necessary to raise the heat of air at a constant\r\nvolume is only 71 per cent. of that required to raise to the same\r\ntemperature the same weight of air under constant pressure. This is\r\nexactly the result which Laplace arrived at from observations on the\r\nvelocity of sound, and may be stated thus--\r\n\r\n                                            Specific        Foot-   Per\r\n                                              heat.        pounds. cent.\r\n\r\nKp = 1 lb. of air at constant pressure       0.2378 × 772 = 183.5 = 100\r\nKv = 1 lb. of air at constant volume         0.1688 × 772 = 130.3 =  71\r\n                                             ------   ---   -----   ---\r\nDifference, being heat converted into power  0.0690 × 772 =  53.2 =  29\r\n\r\n\r\nOr, in a hot-air engine without regeneration, the maximum effect of 1\r\nlb. of air heated 1° Fahr. would be 53.2 f.p. The quantity of heat\r\nKy necessary to heat air under constant volume is to Kv, or that\r\nnecessary to heat it under constant pressure, as 71:100, or as\r\n1:1.408, or very nearly as 1:SQRT(2)--a result which was arrived\r\nat by Masson from theoretical considerations. The 71 per cent.\r\nescaping as heat may be utilized in place of other fuel; and with the\r\nfirst hot-air engine I ever saw, it was employed for drying blocks of\r\nwood. In the same way, the unconverted heat of the exhaust steam from\r\na high-pressure engine, or the heated gases and water passing away\r\nfrom a gas-engine, may be employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to judge what is the practical efficiency of\r\nthe gas-engine. Some years since, in a letter which I addressed to\r\n_Engineering_, and which also appeared in the _Journal of Gas\r\nLighting_,[2] I showed (I believe for the first time) that, in the\r\nOtto-Crossley engine, 18 per cent. of the total heat was converted\r\ninto power, as against the 8 per cent. given by a very good\r\nsteam-engine. About the end of 1883 a very elaborate essay, by M.\r\nWitz, appeared in the _Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, reporting\r\nexperiments on a similar engine, which gave an efficiency somewhat\r\nlower. Early in 1884 there appeared in _Van Nostrand's Engineering\r\nMagazine_ a most valuable paper, by Messrs. Brooks and Steward, with a\r\npreface by Professor Thurston,[3] in which the efficiency was estimated\r\n at 17 to 18 per cent. of the total heat of combustion. Both these\r\npapers show what I had no opportunity of ascertaining, that is, what\r\nbecomes of the 82 per cent. of heat which is not utilized--information\r\nof the greatest importance, as it indicates in what direction\r\nimprovement may be sought for, and how loss may be avoided. But, short\r\nas is the time that has elapsed since the appearance of these papers,\r\nyou will find that progress has been made, and that a still higher\r\nefficiency is now claimed.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 2: See _Journal_, vol. xxxv, pp. 91, 133.]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 3: Ibid., vol. xliii., pp. 703, 744.]\r\n\r\nWhen I first wrote on this subject, I relied upon some data which led\r\nme to suppose that the heating power of ordinary coal gas was higher\r\nthan it really is. At our last meeting, Mr. Hartley proved, by\r\nexperiments with his calorimeter, that gas of 16 or 17 candles gave\r\nonly about 630 units of heat per cubic foot. Now, if all this heat\r\ncould be converted into power, it would yield 630 × 772, or 486,360\r\nf.p.; and it would require only 1,980,000 / 486,360 = 4.07 cubic feet to\r\nproduce 1 indicated horse power. Some recent tests have shown that,\r\nwith gas of similar heating power, 18 cubic feet have given 1\r\nindicated horse power, and therefore 4.07 / 18 = 22.6 of the whole heat\r\nhas been converted--a truly wonderful proportion when compared with\r\nsteam-engines of a similar power, showing only an efficiency of 2 to 4\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThe first gas-engine which came into practical use was Lenoir's,\r\ninvented about 1866, in which the mixture of gas and air drawn in for\r\npart of the stroke at atmospheric pressure was inflamed by the spark\r\nfrom an induction coil. This required a couple of cells of a strong\r\nBunsen battery, was apt to miss fire, and used about 90 cubic feet of\r\ngas per horse power. This was succeeded by Hugon's engine, in which\r\nthe ignition was caused by a small gas flame, and the consumption was\r\nreduced to 80 cubic feet. In 1864 Otto's atmospheric engine was\r\ninvented, in which a heavily-loaded piston was forced upward by an\r\nexplosion of gas and air drawn in at atmospheric pressure. In its\r\nupward stroke the piston was free to move; but in its downward stroke\r\nit was connected with a ratchet, and the partial vacuum formed after\r\nthe explosion beneath the piston, together with its own weight in\r\nfalling, operated through a rack, and caused rotation of the flywheel.\r\nThis engine (which, in an improved form, uses only about 20 cubic feet\r\nof gas) is still largely employed, some 1,600 having been constructed.\r\nThe great objection to it was the noise it produced, and the wear and\r\ntear of the ratchet and rack arrangements. In 1876 the Otto-Crossley\r\nsilent engine was introduced. As you are aware, it is a single-acting\r\nengine, in which the gas and air are drawn in by the first outward,\r\nand compressed by the first inward stroke. The compressed mixture is\r\nthen ignited; and, being expanded by heat, drives the piston outward\r\nby the second outward stroke. Near the end of this stroke the\r\nexhaust-valve is opened, the products of combustion partly escape, and\r\nare partly driven out by the second inward stroke. I say partly, for a\r\nconsiderable clearance space, equal to 38 per cent. of the whole\r\ncylinder volume, remains unexhausted at the inner end of the cylinder.\r\nWhen working to full power, only one stroke out of every four is\r\neffective; but this engine works with only 18 to 22 cubic feet of gas\r\nper horse power. Up to the present time I am informed that about\r\n18,000 of these engines have been manufactured. Several other\r\ncompression engines have been introduced, of which the best known is\r\nMr. Dugald Clerk's, using about 20 feet of Glasgow cannel gas. It\r\ngives one effective stroke for every revolution; the mixture being\r\ncompressed in a separate air-pump. But this arrangement leads to\r\nadditional friction; and the power measured by the brake is a smaller\r\npercentage of the indicated horse power than in the Otto-Crossley\r\nengine. A number of gas engines--such as Bisschop's (much used for\r\nvery small powers), Robson's (at present undergoing transformation in\r\nthe able hands of Messrs. Tangye), Korting's, and others--are in use;\r\nbut, so far as I can learn, all require a larger quantity of gas than\r\nthose previously referred to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OTTO ATMOSPHERIC GAS ENGINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLERCK'S GAS ENGINE, 6 HORSE POWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OTTO-CROSSLEY GAS ENGINE, 16 H.P.\r\n\r\n               Consumption 17.6 cubic feet of 16-candle gas per\r\n               theoretical horse power per hour.\r\n\r\n               Average pressure, 90.4 × constant, .568 theoretical\r\n               horse power per pound = 50.8 theoretical horse power.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATKINSON'S DIFFERENTIAL GAS ENGINE, 8 H.P.]\r\n\r\nI have all along spoken of efficiency as a percentage of the total\r\nquantity of heat evolved by the fuel; and this is, in the eyes of a\r\nmanufacturer, the essential question. Other things being equal, that\r\nengine is the most economical which requires the smallest quantity of\r\ncoal or of gas. But men of science often employ the term efficiency in\r\nanother sense, which I will explain. If I wind a clock, I have spent a\r\ncertain amount of energy lifting the weight. This is called \"energy of\r\nposition;\" and it is returned by the fall of the weight to its\r\noriginal level. In the same way if I heat air or water, I communicate\r\nto it energy of heat, which remains potential as long as the\r\ntemperature does not fall, but which can be spent again by a decrease\r\nof temperature. In every heat-engine, therefore, there must be a fall\r\nfrom a higher to a lower temperature; otherwise no work would be done.\r\nIf the water in the condenser of a steam-engine were as hot as that in\r\nthe boiler, there would be equal pressure on both sides of the piston,\r\nand consequently the engine would remain at rest. Now, the greater the\r\nfall, the greater the power developed; for a smaller proportion of the\r\nheat remains as heat. If we call the higher temperature T and the\r\nlower T' on the absolute scale, T - T' is the difference; and the\r\nratio of this to the higher temperature is called the \"efficiency.\"\r\nThis is the foundation of the formula we meet so often: E = (T - T')/T.\r\nA perfect heat-engine would, therefore, be one in which the\r\ntemperature of the absolute zero would be attained, for (T - O)/T = 1.\r\nThis low temperature, however, has never been reached, and in all\r\npractical cases we are confined within much narrower limits. Taking\r\nthe case of the condensing engine, the limits were 312° to 102°, or\r\n773° and 563° absolute, respectively. The equation then becomes\r\n(773 - 563)/773 = 210/773 or (say) 27 per cent. With non-condensing\r\nengines, the temperatures may be taken as 312° and 212°, or 773° and\r\n673° absolute respectively. The equation then becomes (773 - 673)/773\r\n= 100/773, or nearly 13 per cent. The practical efficiencies are not\r\nnearly this, but they are in about the same ratio--27/13. If, then, we\r\nmultiply the theoretical efficiencies by 0.37, we get the practical\r\nefficiencies, say 10 per cent. and 5 per cent.; and it is in the\r\nformer sense that M. Witz calculated the efficiency of the\r\nsteam-engine at 35 per cent.--a statement which, I own, puzzled me a\r\nlittle when I first met it. These efficiencies do not take any account\r\nof loss of heat before the boiler. In the case of the gas-engine, the\r\nquestion is much more complicated on account of the large clearance\r\nspace and the early opening of the exhaust. The highest temperature\r\nhas been calculated by the American observers at 3,443° absolute, and\r\nthe observed temperature of the exhaust gases was 1,229°. The fraction\r\nthen becomes (3443 - 1229)/3443 = 64 per cent. If we multiply this by\r\n0.37, as we did in the case of the steam-engine, we get 23.7 per\r\ncent., or approximately the same as that arrived at by direct\r\nexperience. Indeed, if the consumption is, as sometimes stated, less\r\nthan 18 feet, the two percentages would be exactly the same. I do not\r\nput this forward as scientifically true; but the coincidence is at\r\nleast striking.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the illuminating power of the gas as of importance;\r\nfor the richer gases have also more calorific power, and an engine\r\nwould, of course, require a smaller quantity of them. The heat-giving\r\npower does not, however, vary as the illuminating power, but at a much\r\nslower rate; and, adopting the same contrivance as that on which the\r\nabsolute scale of temperature is formed, I would suggest a formula of\r\nthe following type: H = C (I + K), in which H represents the number of\r\nheat-units given out by the combustion of 1 cubic foot of gas, I is\r\nthe illuminating power in candles, and C and K two constants to be\r\ndetermined by experiment. If we take the value for motive power of the\r\ndifferent qualities of gas as given in Mr. Charles Hunt's interesting\r\npaper in our Transactions for 1882, C might without any great error be\r\ntaken as 22 and K as 7.5. With Pintsch's oil gas, however, as compared\r\nwith coal gas, this formula does not hold; and C should be taken much\r\nlower, and K much higher than the figures given above. That is to say,\r\nthe heating power increases in a slower progression. The data\r\navailable, however, are few; but I trust that Mr. Hartley will on\r\nthis, as he has done on so many other scientific subjects, come to our\r\naid.\r\n\r\nI will now refer to the valuable experiments of Messrs. Brooks and\r\nSteward, which were most carefully made. Everything was measured--the\r\ngas by a 60 light, and the air by a 300 light meter; the indicated\r\nhorse power, by a steam-engine indicator; the useful work, by a Prony\r\nbrake; the temperature of the water, by a standard thermometer; and\r\nthat of the escaping gases, by a pyrometer. The gas itself was\r\nanalyzed; and its heating power calculated, from its composition, as\r\n617.5[theta]. Its specific gravity was .464; and the volume of air was\r\nabout seven times that of the gas used (or one-eighth of the mixture),\r\nand was only 11½ per cent. by weight more than was needed for perfect\r\ncombustion. The results arrived at were as follows:\r\n\r\n                                          Per cent.\r\n  Converted into indicated horse power,\r\n      including friction, etc.              17.0\r\n  Escaped with the exhaust gas.             15.5\r\n  Escaped in radiation.                     15.5\r\n  Communicated to water in the jacket.      52.0\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that more than half of the heat is communicated\r\nto the water in the jacket. Now, this is the opposite of the\r\nsteam-engine, where the jacket is used to transmit heat _to_ the\r\ncylinder, and not _from_ it. This cooling is rendered necessary,\r\nbecause without it the oil would be carbonized, and lubrication of the\r\ncylinder rendered impossible. Indeed, a similar difficulty has\r\noccurred with all hot-air engines, and is, I think, the reason they\r\nhave not been more generally adopted. I felt this so strongly that,\r\nfor some time after the introduction of the gas-engine, I was very\r\ncautious in recommending those who consulted me to adopt it. I was\r\nafraid that the wear and tear would be excessive. I have, however, for\r\nsome time past been thoroughly satisfied that this fear was needless;\r\nas I am satisfied that a well-made gas-engine is as durable as a\r\nsteam-engine, and the parts subject to wear can be replaced at\r\nmoderate cost. We have no boiler, no feed pump, no stuffing-boxes to\r\nattend to--no water-gauges, pressure-gauges, safety-valve, or\r\nthrottle-valve to be looked after; the governor is of a very simple\r\nconstruction; and the slide-valves may be removed and replaced in a\r\nfew minutes. An occasional cleaning out of the cylinder at\r\nconsiderable intervals is all the supervision that the engine\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nThe very large percentage of heat absorbed by the water-jacket should\r\npoint out to the ingenuity of inventors the first problem to be\r\nattacked, viz., how to save this heat without wasting the lubricant or\r\nmaking it inoperative; and in the solution of this problem, I look for\r\nthe most important improvement to be expected in the engine. The most\r\nobvious contrivance would be some sort of intercepting shield, which\r\nwould save the walls of the cylinder and the rings of the piston from\r\nthe heat of the ignited gases. I have just learned that something of\r\nthe kind is under trial. Another solution may possibly be found in the\r\nemployment of a fluid piston; but here we are placed in a dilemma\r\nbetween the liquids that are decomposed and the metals that are\r\noxidized at high temperatures. Next, the loss by radiation--15 per\r\ncent.--seems large; but this is to be attributed to the fact that the\r\ninside surface of the cylinder is at each inward stroke exposed to the\r\natmosphere--an influence which contributes to the cooling necessary\r\nfor lubrication. The remaining 15 per cent., which is carried away by\r\nthe exhaust, is small compared with the proportion passing away with\r\nthe exhaust steam of a high-pressure or the water of a condensing\r\nengine. As the water in the jacket can be safely raised to 212° Fahr.,\r\nthe whole of the jacket heat can be utilized where hot water is\r\nrequired for other purposes; and this, with the exhaust gases, has\r\nbeen used for drying and heating purposes.\r\n\r\nWith such advantages, it may be asked: Why does not the gas-engine\r\neverywhere supersede the steam-engine? My answer is a simple one: The\r\ngas we manufacture is a dear fuel compared with coal. Ordinary coal\r\ngas measures 30 cubic feet to the pound; and 1,000 cubic feet,\r\ntherefore, weigh 33 lb. Taking the price at 2s. 9d. per 1,000 cubic\r\nfeet, it costs 1d. per lb. The 30 cubic feet at 630[theta] give\r\n19,000[theta] all available heat. Although good coal may yield 14,000\r\nunits by its combustion, only about 11,000 of these reach the boiler;\r\nso that the ratio of the useful heat is 11/19. The thermal efficiency\r\nof the best non-condensing engine to that of the gas-engine is in the\r\nratio 4/22. Multiplying together these two ratios, we get\r\n\r\n        11     4        44\r\n        -- x ------- = ----\r\n        19   22_{1/2}  4.28\r\n\r\nThat is, speaking roughly, 1 lb. of gas gives about ten times as much\r\npower as 1 lb. of coal does in a good non-condensing engine. But at\r\n18s. 8d. a ton we get 10 lb. of coal for 1d.; so that with these\r\nfigures the cheapness of the coal would just compensate for the\r\nefficiency of the gas. As to the waste heat passing away from the\r\nengine being utilized, here the gas-engine has no advantage; and, so\r\nfar as this is concerned, the gas is about eight times dearer than\r\ncoal. The prices of gas and coal vary so much in different places that\r\nit is hard to determine in what cases gas or coal will be the dearer\r\nfuel, considering this point alone.\r\n\r\nBut there are other kinds of non-illuminating gases--such as Wilson's,\r\nStrong's, and Dowson's--which are now coming into use; and at Messrs.\r\nCrossley's works you will have an opportunity of seeing a large\r\nengineering factory employing several hundred mechanics, and without a\r\nchimney, in which every shaft and tool is driven by gas-engines\r\nsupplied by Dowson's gas, and in which the consumption of coal is only\r\n1.2 lb. per indicated horse power. The greatest economy ever claimed\r\nfor the steam-engine was a consumption of 1.6 lb.; and this with steam\r\nof very high pressure, expanded in three cylinders successively. Thus\r\nin a quarter of a century the gas-engine has beaten in the race the\r\nsteam-engine; although from Watt's first idea of improvement, nearly a\r\ncentury and a quarter have elapsed.\r\n\r\nAs regards the steam-engine, it is the opinion of competent\r\nauthorities that the limits of temperature between which it works are\r\nso restricted, and so much of the heat is expended in producing a\r\nchange of state from liquid to vapor, that little further improvement\r\ncan be made. With respect to gas-engines, the limits of temperature\r\nare much further apart. A change of state is not required, and so very\r\ngreat improvement may still be looked for. It is not impossible even\r\nthat some of the younger members of our body may live to see that\r\nperiod foretold by one of the greatest of our civil engineers--that\r\nhappy time when boiler explosions will only be matters of history;\r\nthat period, not a millennium removed by a thousand years, but an era\r\ndeferred perhaps by only half a dozen decades, when the use of the\r\ngas-engine will be universal, and \"a steam-engine can be found only in\r\na cabinet of antiquities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discussion._\r\n\r\nThe President said this was a very delightful paper; and nothing could\r\nbe finer than Mr. Lane's description of the conversion of heat into\r\npower, and the gradual growth of theory into practical work.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Foulis (Glasgow) agreed that it was admirable; but it required\r\nto be read to be thoroughly appreciated. When members were able to\r\nread it, they would find Mr. Lane had given a very clear description\r\nof the elementary principles of thermo-dynamics in their relation to\r\nthe gas-engine and the steam-engine. There was very little in the\r\npaper to raise discussion; but Mr. Lane had made exceedingly clear how\r\nthe present loss in a gas-engine was occasioned, and had also shown\r\nhow, in the future development of the engine, the loss might be saved,\r\nand the engine rendered more efficient.\r\n\r\nMr. H.P. Holt (of Messrs. Crossley Bros., Limited) said he could\r\nindorse everything Mr. Lane had said. He had found the paper most\r\ninteresting and instructive even to himself, though he had some little\r\npractical experience of gas-engines, and was supposed to know a little\r\nabout them. He did not pretend to be able to teach other people; but\r\nif he could say anything as to indicator cards, or answer any\r\nquestions, he should be happy to do so. (He then described the\r\nindicator diagram of the atmospheric gas-engine.) In this engine the\r\nproportion of the charging stroke to the whole sweep of the piston was\r\nabout 10 per cent.; and as the charge drawn in consisted of about 10\r\nper cent. of gas, about 1-100 of the total sweep of the piston was\r\ncomposed of the gas.\r\n\r\nMr. Foulis asked what proportion the power indicated on the diagram\r\nbore to the power indicated on the brake in the atmospheric engine.\r\n\r\nMr. Holt said unfortunately he had not any figures with him which\r\nwould give this information; and it was so long since he had anything\r\npractically to do with this form of engine, that he should not like to\r\nspeak from memory. He might add that the largest size of gas-engine\r\nmade (of about 100 horse power indicated) was at work at Messrs. Edwin\r\nButterworth and Co.'s, of Manchester. It was now driven by ordinary\r\ncoal gas; but Dowson plant was to be put up very shortly in order to\r\nreduce the cost of working, which, though not excessive, would be\r\nstill more economical with the Dowson gas--probably only about 30s.\r\nper week. The present cost was about £4 per week, though it was not\r\nworking always at full power.\r\n\r\nMr. T. Holgate (Batley) said he thought it was generally understood,\r\nby those who had studied the subject, that the adoption of compression\r\nof the gaseous mixture before ignition had, so far, more than anything\r\nelse, contributed to the improved working of gas-engines. This fact\r\nhad not been sufficiently brought out in the paper, although Mr. Lane\r\nhad clearly indicated some of the directions in which further\r\nimprovements were likely to obtain. Gas engineers were largely\r\nindebted to Mr. Dugald Clerk for the statement he had made of the\r\ntheory of the gas-engine.[4] Mr. Lane had given some figures, arrived\r\nat by Messrs. Brooks and Steward, from experiments made in America;\r\nbut, prior to these Mr. Clerk had given others which were in the main\r\nin accordance with them. Professor Kennedy had also made experiments,\r\nthe results of which agreed with them.[5] The extent of the loss by\r\nthe cooling water was thus well ascertained; and it was no doubt by a\r\nreduction of this loss that further improvement in the working of\r\ngas-engines would eventually be obtained.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 4: See Journal, vol. xxxix., p. 648.]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 5: Ibid., vol. xl., p. 955.]\r\n\r\nMr. J. Paterson (Warrington) expressed his appreciation of the paper,\r\nas one of exceptional interest and value. He said he did not rise with\r\na view to make any observations thereon. The analysis of first\r\nprinciples required more matured consideration and thought than could\r\nbe given to it here. The opinion, however, he had formed of the paper\r\nplaced it beyond the reach of criticism. It was now many years since\r\nhis attention had been drawn to the name of Denny Lane; and everything\r\nthat had come from his facile pen conveyed sound scientific\r\nconclusions. The paper to which they had just listened was no\r\nexception. It was invested with great interest, and would be regarded\r\nas a valuable contribution to the Transactions of the Institute.\r\n\r\nMr. Lane, in reply, thanked the members for the kind expressions used\r\nwith respect to his paper. His object in writing it was that any one\r\nwho had not paid any attention to the subject before should be able to\r\nunderstand thoroughly the principles on which gas and hot-air engines\r\noperated; and he believed any one who read it with moderate care would\r\nperfectly understand all the essential conditions of the gas-engine.\r\nHe might mention that not long after the thermo-dynamic theory was so\r\nfar developed as to determine the amount of heat converted into power,\r\na very eminent French Engineer--M. Hirn--conducted some experiments on\r\nsteam-engines at a large factory, and thought he could account for the\r\nwhole heat of combustion in the condensed water and the heat which\r\npassed away; so much so that he actually doubted altogether the theory\r\nof thermo-dynamics. However, being open to conviction, he made further\r\nexperiments, and discovered that he had been in error, and ultimately\r\nbecame one of the most energetic supporters of the theory. This showed\r\nhow necessary it was to be careful before arriving at a conclusion on\r\nsuch a subject. He had endeavored, as far as the nature of the case\r\nallowed, to avoid any scientific abstractions, because he knew that\r\nwhen practical men came to theory--_x's_ and _y's_, differentials,\r\nintegrals, and other mathematical formulæ--they were apt to be\r\nterrified.\r\n\r\nThe President said it was like coming down to every day life to say\r\nthat it was important that gas managers should be familiar with the\r\nappliances used in the consumption of gas, and should be able, when\r\ncalled upon, to give an intelligent description of their method of\r\nworking. A study of Mr. Lane's paper would reveal many matters of\r\ninterest with regard to this wonderful motor, which was coming daily\r\nmore and more into use, not only to the advantage of gas\r\nmanufacturers, but of those who employed them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. MEIZEL'S RECIPROCATING EXHAUSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the recent Congress of the Societe Technique de l'Industrie du Gaz\r\nen France, M. Meizel, Chief Engineer of the St. Etienne Gas Works,\r\ndescribed a new exhauster devised by him on the reciprocating\r\nprinciple, and for which he claims certain advantages over the\r\nappliances now in general use. Exhausters constructed on the\r\nabove-named principle have hitherto, M. Meizel says, been costly to\r\nfit up, owing to the necessity for providing machinery and special\r\nmechanism for the transmission of motion. This has prevented the\r\nemployment of cylinders of large dimensions; and, consequently, when\r\nthe quantity of gas to be dealt with has been considerable, the number\r\nof exhausters has had to be increased. The result of this has been\r\ninconvenience, which has led to a preference being shown for other\r\nkinds of exhausters, notwithstanding the manifest advantages which, in\r\nM. Meizel's opinion, those of the reciprocating type possess. The\r\nimprovement which he has effected in these appliances consists in the\r\napplication to them of cylinders working automatically; and the\r\ngeneral features of the arrangement are shown in the accompanying\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED RECIPROCATING GAS EXHAUSTER.]\r\n\r\nThe principal advantages to be gained by the use of this exhauster are\r\nstated by M. Meizel to be the following: Considerably less motive\r\nforce is necessary than is the case with other exhausters, which\r\nrequire steam engines and all the auxiliary mechanism for the\r\ntransmission of power. By its quiet and regular action, it prevents\r\noscillation and unsteadiness in the flow of gas in the hydraulic main,\r\nas well as in the pipes leading therefrom--a defect which has been\r\nfound to exist with other exhausters. The bells, being of large area,\r\nserve the purpose of a condenser; and as, owing to its density, the\r\ntar falls to the bottom of the lower vessels, which are filled with\r\nwater, contact between the gas and tar is avoided. Although the\r\nappliance is of substantial construction, its action is so sensitive\r\nthat it readily adapts itself to the requirements of production. It\r\nmay be placed in the open air; and therefore its establishment is\r\nattended with less outlay than is the case with other exhausters,\r\nwhich have to be placed under cover, and provided with driving\r\nmachinery and, of course, a supply of steam.\r\n\r\nThe total superficial area of the exhauster above described, including\r\nthe governor, is 150 square feet; and its capacity per 24 hours is\r\n230,000 cubic feet. It works silently, with an almost entire absence\r\nof friction; and consequently there are few parts which require\r\nlubrication. Exhausters of this type (which, M. Meizel says, could be\r\nmade available for ventilation purposes, in case of necessity) may be\r\nconstructed of all sizes, from 500 cubic feet per hour upward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC SIPHON FOR IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, at an elevated point in a meadow, there exists a spring or vein\r\nof water that cannot be utilized at a distance, either because the\r\nsupply is not sufficient, or because of the permeability of the soil,\r\nit becomes very advantageous to accumulate the water in a reservoir,\r\nwhich may be emptied from time to time through an aperture large\r\nenough to allow the water to flow in abundance over all parts of the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIRAL'S AUTOMATIC SIPHON.]\r\n\r\nThe storing up of the water permits of irrigating a much greater area\r\nof land, and has the advantage of allowing the watering to be effected\r\nintermittingly, this being better than if it were done continuously.\r\nBut this mode of irrigating requires assiduous attention. It is\r\nnecessary, in fact, when the reservoir is full, to go and raise the\r\nplug, wait till the water has flowed out, and then put in the plug\r\nagain as accurately as possible--a thing that it is not always easy to\r\ndo. The work is a continuous piece of drudgery, and takes just as much\r\nthe longer to do in proportion as the reservoir is more distant from\r\none's dwelling. In order to do away with this inconvenience, Mr.\r\nGiral, of Langogne (Lozere), has invented a sort of movable siphon\r\nthat primes itself automatically, however small be the spring that\r\nfeeds the reservoir in which it is placed. The apparatus (see figure)\r\nconsists of an elbowed pipe, C A B D E, of galvanized iron, whose\r\nextremity, C, communicates with the outlet, R, where it is fixed by\r\nmeans of a piece of rubber of peculiar form that allows the other\r\nextremity, B D E, to revolve around the axis, K, while at the same\r\ntime keeping the outlet pipe hermetically closed. This rubber, whose\r\nlower extremity is bent back like the bell of a trumpet, forms a\r\nwasher against which there is applied a galvanized iron ring that is\r\nfixed to the mouth of the outlet pipe by means of six small screws.\r\nThis ring is provided with two studs which engage with two flexible\r\nthimbles, K and L, that are affixed to the siphon by four rivets.\r\nThese studs and thimbles, as well as the screws, are likewise\r\ngalvanized. Between the branches, A B D E, of the pipe there is\r\nsoldered a sheet of galvanized iron, which forms isolatedly a\r\nreceptacle or air-chamber, F, that contains at its upper part a small\r\naperture, _b_, that remains always open, and, at its lower part, a\r\ncopper screw-plug, _d_, and a galvanized hook, H.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of this chamber there is arranged a small leaden\r\nsiphon, _a b c_, whose longer leg, _a_, passes through the bottom,\r\nwhere it is soldered, and whose shorter one, _c_, ends in close\r\nproximity to the bottom. Finally, a galvanized iron chain, G H, fixed\r\nat G to the bottom of the reservoir, and provided with a weight, P, of\r\ngalvanized iron, is hooked at H to the siphon and allows it to rise\r\nmore or less, according as it is given a greater or less length.\r\n\r\nFrom what precedes, it will be seen that the outlet is entirely\r\nclosed, so that, in order that the water may escape, it must pass into\r\nthe pipe in the direction, E D B A C.\r\n\r\nThis granted, let us see how the apparatus works: In measure as the\r\nwater rises in the reservoir, the siphon gradually loses weight, and\r\nits extremity, B D H, is finally lifted by the thrust, so that the\r\nentire affair revolves upon the studs, K, until the chain becomes\r\ntaut. The apparatus then ceases to rise; but the water, ever\r\ncontinuing to rise, finally reaches the apex, _b_, of the smaller\r\nsiphon, and, through it, enters the air chamber and fills it. The\r\nequilibrium being thus broken, the siphon descends to the bottom,\r\nbecomes primed, and empties the reservoir. When the level of the\r\nwater, in descending, is at the height of the small siphon, _a b c_,\r\nthis latter, which is also primed, empties the chamber, F, in turn, so\r\nthat, at the moment the large siphon loses its priming, the entire\r\napparatus is in the same state that it was at first.\r\n\r\nIn short, when the water enters the reservoir, the siphon, movable\r\nupon its base, rises to the height at which it is desired that the\r\nflow shall take place. Being arrested at this point by the chain, it\r\nbecomes primed, and sinks, and the water escapes. When the water is\r\nexhausted, the siphon rises anew in order to again sink; and this goes\r\non as long as the period of irrigation lasts.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, which is simple in its operation, and not very costly,\r\nis being employed with success for irrigating several meadows in the\r\nupper basin of the Allier.--_Le Genie Civil._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASSAY OF EARTHENWARE GLAZE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLead oxide melted or incompletely vitrified is still in common use in\r\nthe manufacture of inferior earthenware, and sometimes leads to\r\nserious results. To detect lead in a glaze, M. Herbelin moistens a\r\nslip of white linen or cotton, free from starch, with nitric acid at\r\n10 per cent. and rubs it for ten to fifteen seconds on the side of the\r\nutensil under examination, and then deposits a drop of a solution of\r\npotassium iodide, at 5 per cent. on the part which has been in\r\ncontact. A lead glaze simply fused gives a very highly colored yellow\r\nspot of potassium iodide; a lead glaze incompletely vitrified gives\r\nspots the more decided, the less perfect the vitrification; and a\r\nglaze of good quality gives no sensible color at all.--_M.

COWLES, ALFRED H. COWLES, AND CHARLES F. MABERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of electricity to metallurgical processes has hitherto\r\nbeen confined to the reduction of metals from solutions, and few\r\nattempts have been made to effect dry reductions by means of an\r\nelectric current. Sir W. Siemens attempted to utilize the intense heat\r\nof an electric arc for this purpose, but accomplished little beyond\r\nfusing several pounds of steel. A short time since, Eugene H. Cowles\r\nand Alfred H. Cowles of Cleveland conceived the idea of obtaining a\r\ncontinuous high temperature on an extended scale by introducing into\r\nthe path of an electric current some material that would afford the\r\nrequisite resistance, thereby producing a corresponding increase in\r\nthe temperature. After numerous experiments that need not be described\r\nin detail, coarsely pulverized carbon was selected as the best means\r\nfor maintaining a variable resistance and at the same time as the most\r\navailable substance for the reduction of oxides. When this material,\r\nmixed with the oxide to be reduced, was made a part of the electric\r\ncircuit in a fire clay retort, and submitted to the action of a\r\ncurrent from a powerful dynamo machine, not only was the oxide\r\nreduced, but the temperature increased to such an extent that the\r\nwhole interior of the retort fused completely. In other experiments\r\nlumps of lime, sand, and corundum were fused, with indications of a\r\nreduction of the corresponding metal; on cooling, the lime formed\r\nlarge, well-defined crystals, the corundum beautiful red, green, and\r\nblue hexagonal crystals.\r\n\r\nFollowing up these results with the assistance of Charles F. Mabery,\r\nprofessor of chemistry in the Case School of Applied Science, who\r\nbecame interested at this stage of the experiments, it was soon found\r\nthat the intense heat thus produced could be utilized for the\r\nreduction of oxides in large quantities, and experiments were next\r\ntried on a large scale with a current from two dynamos driven by an\r\nequivalent of fifty horse power. For the protection of the walls of\r\nthe furnace, which were made of fire brick, a mixture of the ore and\r\ncoarsely pulverized gas carbon was made a central core, and it was\r\nsurrounded on the sides and bottom by fine charcoal, the current\r\nfollowing the lesser resistance of the central core from carbon\r\nelectrodes which were inserted at the ends of the furnace in contact\r\nwith the core. In order to protect the machines from the variable\r\nresistance within the furnace, a resistance box consisting of a coil\r\nof German silver wire placed in a large tank of water was introduced\r\ninto the main circuit, and a Brush ammeter was also attached by means\r\nof a shunt circuit, to indicate the quantity of current that was being\r\nabsorbed in the furnace. The latter was charged by first filling it\r\nwith charcoal, making a trough in the center, and filling this central\r\nspace with the ore mixture, which was covered with a layer of coarse\r\ncharcoal. The furnace was closed at the top with fire brick slabs\r\ncontaining two or three holes for the escape of the gaseous products\r\nof the reduction, and the entire furnace made air-tight by luting with\r\nfire clay. Within a few minutes after starting the dynamo, a stream of\r\ncarbonic oxide issued through the openings, burning usually with a\r\nflame eighteen inches in height. The time required for complete\r\nreduction was ordinarily about an hour.\r\n\r\nThe furnace at present in use is charged in substantially the same\r\nmanner, and the current is supplied by a Brush machine of variable\r\nelectromotive force driven by an equivalent of forty horse power. A\r\nBrush machine capable of utilizing 125 horse power, or two and\r\none-half times as large as any hitherto constructed by the Brush\r\nElectric Company, is being made for the Cowles Electric Smelting and\r\nAluminum Company, and this machine will soon be in operation.\r\nExperiments already made so that aluminum, silicon, boron, manganese,\r\nmagnesium, sodium and potassium can be reduced from their oxides with\r\nease. In fact, there is no oxide that can withstand temperatures\r\nattainable in this electrical furnace. Charcoal is changed to\r\ngraphite. Does this indicate fusion or solution of carbon? As to what\r\ncan be accomplished by converting enormous electrical energy into heat\r\nwithin a limited space, it can only be said that it opens the way into\r\nan extensive field for both pure and applied chemistry. It is not\r\ndifficult to conceive of temperatures limited only by the capability\r\nof carbon to resist fusion. The results to be obtained with the large\r\nBrush machine above mentioned will be of some importance in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nSince the cost of the motive power is the chief expense in\r\naccomplishing reductions by this method, its commercial success is\r\nclosely connected with the cheapest form of power to be obtained.\r\nRealizing the importance of this point, the Cowles Electric Smelting\r\nand Aluminum Company has purchased an extensive and reliable water\r\npower, and works are soon to be erected for the utilization of 1,200\r\nhorse power. An important feature in the use of these furnaces, from a\r\ncommercial standpoint, is the slight technical skill required in their\r\nmanipulation. The four furnaces in operation in the experimental\r\nlaboratory at Cleveland are in charge of two young men twenty years of\r\nage, who, six months ago, knew absolutely nothing of electricity. The\r\nproducts at present manufactured are the various grades of aluminum\r\nbronze made from a rich furnace product that is obtained by adding\r\ncopper to the charge of ore, silicon bronze prepared in the same\r\nmanner, and aluminum silver, an alloy of aluminum with several other\r\nmetals. A boron bronze may be prepared by the reduction of boracic\r\nacid in contact with copper.\r\n\r\nAs commercial results may be mentioned the production in the\r\nexperimental laboratory, which averages fifty pounds of 10 per cent.\r\naluminum bronze daily, and it can be supplied to the trade in large\r\nquantities at prices based on $5 per pound for the aluminum contained,\r\nthe lowest market quotation of this metal being at present $15 per\r\npound. Silicon bronze can be furnished at prices far below those of\r\nthe French manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe alloys which the metals obtained by the methods above described\r\nform with copper have been made the subject of careful study. An alloy\r\ncontaining 10 per cent. of aluminum and 90 per cent. of copper forms\r\nthe so-called aluminum bronze with a fine golden color, which it\r\nretains for a long time. The tensile strength of this alloy is usually\r\ngiven as 100,000 pounds to the square inch; but castings of our ten\r\nper cent. bronze have stood a strain of 109,000 pounds. It is a very\r\nhard, tough alloy, with a capacity to withstand wear far in excess of\r\nany other alloy in use. All grades of aluminum bronze make fine\r\ncastings, taking very exact impressions, and there is no loss in\r\nremelting, as in the case of alloys containing zinc. The 5 per cent.\r\naluminum alloy is a close approximation in color to 18 carat gold, and\r\ndoes not tarnish readily. Its tensile strength in the form of castings\r\nis equivalent to a strain of 68,000 pounds to the square inch. An\r\nalloy containing 2 or 3 per cent. aluminum is stronger than brass,\r\npossesses greater permanency of color, and would make an excellent\r\nsubstitute for that metal. When the percentage of aluminum reaches 13,\r\nan exceedingly hard, brittle alloy of a reddish color is obtained, and\r\nhigher percentages increase the brittleness, and the color becomes\r\ngrayish-black. Above 25 per cent. the strength again increases.\r\n\r\nThe effect of silicon in small proportions upon copper is to greatly\r\nincrease its tensile strength. When more than 5 per cent. is present,\r\nthe product is exceedingly brittle and grayish-black in color. It is\r\nprobable that silicon acts to a certain extent as a fluxing material\r\nupon the oxides present in the copper, thereby making the metal more\r\nhomogeneous. On account of its superior strength and high conductivity\r\nfor electrical currents, silicon bronze is the best material known for\r\ntelegraph and telephone wire.\r\n\r\nThe element boron seems to have almost as marked an effect upon copper\r\nas carbon does upon iron. A small percentage in copper increases its\r\nstrength to 50,000 or 60,000 pounds per square inch without\r\ndiminishing to any large extent its conductivity.\r\n\r\nAluminum increases very considerably the strength of all metals with\r\nwhich it is alloyed. An alloy of copper and nickel containing a small\r\npercentage of aluminum, called Hercules metal, withstood a strain of\r\n105,000 pounds, and broke without elongation. Another grade of this\r\nmetal broke under a strain of 111,000 pounds, with an elongation\r\nequivalent to 33 per cent. It must be remembered that these tests were\r\nall made upon castings of the alloys. The strength of common brass is\r\ndoubled by the addition of 2 or 3 per cent. of aluminum. Alloys of\r\naluminum and iron are obtained without difficulty; one product was\r\nanalyzed, containing 40 per cent. of aluminum. In the furnace iron\r\ndoes not seem to be absorbed readily by the reduced aluminum when\r\ncopper is present; but in one experiment a mixture composed of old\r\nfiles, 60 per cent.; nickel, 5 per cent.; and of 10 per cent. aluminum\r\nbronze 35 per cent., was melted together, and it gave a malleable\r\nproduct that stood a strain of 69,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nWhen the reduction of aluminic oxide by carbon is conducted without\r\nthe addition of copper, a brittle product is obtained that behaves in\r\nmany respects like pig iron as it comes from the blast furnace. The\r\nsame product is formed in considerable quantities, even when copper is\r\npresent, and frequently the copper alloy is found embedded in it.\r\nGraphite is always found associated with it, even when charcoal is the\r\nreducing material, and analysis invariably shows a very high\r\npercentage of metallic aluminum. This extremely interesting substance\r\nis at present under examination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COWLES ELECTRIC SMELTING PROCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of electricity in the reduction of metals from their ores is\r\nextending so rapidly, and the methods of its generation and\r\napplication have been so greatly improved within a few years, that the\r\npossibility of its becoming the chief agent in the metallurgy of the\r\nfuture may now be admitted, even in cases where the present cost of\r\ntreatment is too high to be commercially advantageous.\r\n\r\nThe refining of copper and the separation of copper, gold, and silver\r\nby electrolysis have thus far attracted the greatest amount of\r\nattention, but a commercial success has also been achieved in the dry\r\nreduction by electricity of some of the more valuable metals by the\r\nCowles Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company, of Cleveland, Ohio.\r\nBoth this method of manufacture and the qualities of the products are\r\nso interesting and important that it is with pleasure we call\r\nattention to them as steps toward that large and cheap production of\r\naluminum that the abundance of its ores and the importance of its\r\nphysical properties have for several years made the unattained goal of\r\nmany skillful metallurgists.\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. Cowles have succeeded in greatly reducing the market value\r\nof aluminum and its alloys, and thereby vastly extending its uses, and\r\nthey are now by far the largest producers in the world of these\r\nimportant products. As described in their patents, the Cowles process\r\nconsists essentially in the use for metallurgical purposes of a body\r\nof granular material of high resistance or low conductivity interposed\r\nwithin the circuit in such a manner as to form a continuous and\r\nunbroken part of the same, which granular body, by reason of its\r\nresistance, is made incandescent, and generates all the heat required.\r\nThe ore or light material to be reduced--as, for example, the hydrated\r\noxide of aluminum, alum, chloride of sodium, oxide of calcium, or\r\nsulphate of strontium--is usually mixed with the body of granular\r\nresistance material, and is thus brought directly in contact with the\r\nheat at the points of generation, at the same time the heat is\r\ndistributed through the mass of granular material, being generated by\r\nthe resistance of all the granules, and is not localized at one point\r\nor along a single line. The material best adapted for this purpose is\r\nelectric light carbon, as it possesses the necessary amount of\r\nelectrical resistance, and is capable of enduring any known degree of\r\nheat when protected from oxygen without disintegrating or fusing; but\r\ncrystalline silicon or other equivalent of carbon can be employed for\r\nthe same purpose. This is pulverized or granulated, the degree of\r\ngranulation depending upon the size of the furnace. Coarse granulated\r\ncarbon works better than finely pulverized carbon, and gives more even\r\nresults. The electrical energy is more evenly distributed, and the\r\ncurrent can not so readily form a path of highest temperature, and\r\nconsequently of least resistance through the mass along which the\r\nentire current or the bulk of the current can pass. The operation must\r\nnecessarily be conducted within an air-tight chamber or in a\r\nnon-oxidizing atmosphere, as otherwise the carbon will be consumed and\r\nact as fuel. The carbon acts as a deoxidizing agent for the ore or\r\nmetalliferous material treated, and to this extent it is consumed, but\r\notherwise than from this cause, it remains unimpaired.\r\n\r\nFig. I. of the accompanying drawings is a vertical longitudinal\r\nsection through a retort designed for the reduction of zinc ore,\r\naccording to this process, and Fig. II. is a front elevation of the\r\nsame. Fig. III. is a perspective view of a furnace adapted to\r\nwithstand a very high temperature, and Figs. IV. and V. are\r\nrespectively longitudinal and transverse sections of the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COWLES ELECTRIC SMELTING PROCESS.]\r\n\r\nThis retort consists of a cylinder, A, made of silica or other\r\nnon-conducting material, suitably embedded in a body, B, of powdered\r\ncharcoal, mineral wool, or of some other material which is not a good\r\nconductor of heat. The rear end of the retort-cylinder is closed by\r\nmeans of a carbon plate, C, which plate forms the positive electrode,\r\nand with this plate the positive wire of the electric circuit is\r\nconnected. The outer end of the retort is closed by means of an\r\ninverted graphite crucible, D, to which the negative wire of the\r\nelectric circuit is attached. The graphite crucible serves as a plug\r\nfor closing the end of the retort. It also forms a condensing chamber\r\nfor the zinc fumes, and it also constitutes the negative electrode.\r\nThe term \"electrode\" is used in this case as designating the terminals\r\nof the circuit proper, or that portion of it which acts simply as an\r\nelectrical conductor, and not with the intention of indicating the\r\nends of a line between which there is no circuit connection. The\r\ncircuit between the \"electrodes,\" so called, is continuous, being\r\nestablished by means of and through the body of broken carbon\r\ncontained in the retort, A. There is no deposit made on either plate\r\nof the decomposed constituents of the material reduced. The mouth of\r\nthe crucible is closed with a luting of clay, or otherwise, and the\r\nopening, _d_, made in the upper side of the crucible, near its\r\nextremity, comes entirely within the retort, and forms a passage for\r\nthe zinc fumes from the retort chamber into the condensing chamber.\r\nThe pipe, E, serves as a vent for the condensing chamber. The zinc ore\r\nis mixed with pulverized or granular carbon, and the retort charged\r\nnearly full through the front end with the mixture, the plug, D, being\r\nremoved for this purpose.\r\n\r\nA small space is left at the top, as shown. After the plug has been\r\ninserted and the joint properly luted, the electric circuit is closed\r\nand the current allowed to pass through the retort, traversing its\r\nentire length through the body of mixed ore and carbon. The carbon\r\nconstituents of the mass become incandescent, generating a very high\r\ndegree of heat, and being in direct contact with the ore, the latter\r\nis rapidly and effectually reduced and distilled. The heat evolved\r\nreduces the ore and distills the zinc, and the zinc fumes are\r\ncondensed in the condensing chamber, precisely as in the present\r\nmethod of zinc making, with this important exception that, aside from\r\nthe reaction produced by heating carbon in the presence of zinc oxide,\r\nthe electric current, in passing through the zinc oxide, has a\r\ndecomposing and disintegrating action upon it, not unlike the effect\r\nproduced by an electric current in a solution. This action accelerates\r\nthe reduction, and promotes economy in the process.\r\n\r\nAnother form of furnace is illustrated by Fig. III., which is a\r\nperspective view of a furnace adapted for the reduction of ores and\r\nsalts of non-volatile metals and similar chemical compounds. Figs. IV.\r\nand V. are longitudinal and transverse sections, respectively, through\r\nthe same, illustrating the manner of packing and charging the furnace.\r\n\r\nThe walls and floors L L', of the furnace are made of fire bricks, and\r\ndo not necessarily have to be very thick or strong, the heat to which\r\nthey are subjected not being excessive. The carbon plates are smaller\r\nthan the cross section of the box, as shown, and the spaces between\r\nthem and the end walls are packed with fine charcoal.\r\n\r\nThe furnace is covered with a removable slab of fireclay, N, which is\r\nprovided with one or more vents, _n_, for the escaping gases.\r\n\r\nThe space between the carbon plates constitutes the working part of\r\nthe furnace. This is lined on the bottom and sides with a packing of\r\nfine charcoal, O, or such other material as is both a poor conductor\r\nof heat and electricity--as, for example, in some cases, silica or\r\npulverized corundum or well-burned lime--and the charge, P, of ore and\r\nbroken, granular, or pulverized carbon occupies the center of the box,\r\nextending between the carbon plates. A layer of granular charcoal, O',\r\nalso covers the charge on top. The protection afforded by the charcoal\r\njacket, as regards the heat, is so complete, that with the\r\ncovering-slab removed, the hand can be held within a few inches of the\r\nexposed charcoal jacket; but with the top covering of charcoal also\r\nremoved and the core exposed, the hand cannot be held within several\r\nfeet. The charcoal packing behind the carbon plates is required to\r\nconfine the heat and to protect them from combustion.\r\n\r\nWith this furnace, aluminum can be reduced directly from its ores; and\r\nchemical compounds from corundum, cryolite, clay, etc., and silicon,\r\nboron, calcium, manganese, magnesium, and other metals are in like\r\nmanner obtained from their ores and compounds. The reduction of ores\r\naccording to this process can be practiced, if circumstances require\r\nit, without any built furnace.\r\n\r\nAt present, the Cowles company is engaged mostly in the producing of\r\naluminum bronze and aluminum silver and silicon bronze. The plant,\r\nwere it run to its full capacity, is capable of turning out eighty\r\npounds of aluminum bronze, containing 10 per cent. of aluminum daily;\r\nor, were it to run upon silicon bronze, could turn out one hundred and\r\ntwenty pounds of that per day, or, we believe, more aluminum bronze\r\ndaily than can be produced by all other plants in the world combined.\r\nThis production, however, is but that of the experimental laboratory,\r\nand arrangements are making to turn out a ton of bronze daily, and the\r\nworks have an ultimate capacity of from eight to ten thousand horse\r\npower. The energy consumed by the reduction of the ore is almost\r\nentirely electrical, only enough carbon being used to unite with the\r\noxygen of the ore to carry it out of the furnace in the form of the\r\ncarbon monoxide, the aluminum remaining behind. Consequently, the\r\nplant necessary to produce aluminum on a large scale involves a large\r\nnumber of the most powerful dynamos. These are to be driven by\r\nwater-power or natural gas and marine engines of great capacity.\r\n\r\nThe retail price of standard 10 per cent. aluminum bronze is $1 per\r\npound avoirdupois, which means less than $9 per pound for aluminum,\r\nthe lowest price at which it has ever been sold, yet the Cowles\r\ncompany has laid a proposition before the Government to furnish this\r\nsame bronze in large quantities at very much lower prices than this.\r\nThe Hercules alloy, castings of which will stand over 100,000 pounds\r\nto the square inch tensile strain, sells at 75 c. a pound, and is also\r\noffered the Government or other large consumers at a heavy discount.\r\nThe alloys are guaranteed to contain exactly what is advertised; they\r\nare standardized into 10 per cent., 7.5 per cent., 5 per cent. and 2.5\r\nper cent. aluminum bronze before shipment.\r\n\r\nThe current available at the Cowles company's works was, until\r\nrecently, 330 amperes, driven by an electromotive force of 110 volts\r\nand supplied by two Edison dynamos; but the company has now added a\r\nlarge Brush machine that has a current of 560 amperes and 52 volts\r\nelectromotive force. We shall, on another occasion, give some\r\nparticulars of experiments in the reduction of refractory ores by the\r\nprocess.--_Eng. and Mining Jour._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTICAL TELEGRAPHY.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: Continued from page 8094.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCRYPTOGRAPHY.--PRESERVATION OF TELEGRAMS.\r\n\r\nOptical telegraphy, by reason of its very principle, presents both the\r\nadvantage and inconvenience of leaving no automatic trace of the\r\ncorrespondence that it transmits. The advantage is very evident in\r\ncases in which an optical station falls into the hands of the enemy;\r\non the other hand, the inconvenience is shown in cases where a badly\r\ntransmitted or badly collated telegram allows an ambiguity to stand\r\nsubject to dispute. Moreover, in case of warfare between civilized\r\nnations that have all the resources of science at their disposal,\r\nthere may be reason to fear lest one of the enemy's optical stations\r\nsubstitute itself for the corresponding station, and take advantage of\r\nthe situation to throw confusion into the orders transmitted. The\r\nremedy for this appears to reside in the use of cryptography and in\r\nthe exchange, at various intervals, of certain words that have been\r\nagreed upon beforehand, and that the enemy is ignorant of.\r\n\r\nAs for the automatic preservation of telegrams, the problem has not\r\nbeen satisfactorily solved. It has been proposed to connect the key of\r\nthe manipulator of the optical apparatus with the manipulator of an\r\nordinary Morse apparatus, thus permitting the telegram to be preserved\r\nupon a band of paper. It is unnecessary to say that the space occupied\r\nby a dispatch thus transmitted would be considerable; but this is not\r\nwhat has stopped innovators. The principal objection resides in the\r\nincrease in muscular work imposed by this arrangement upon the\r\ntelegrapher. Obliged to keep his eye fixed intently at the receiving\r\ntelescope, while at the same time maneuvering the manipulator and\r\nspelling aloud the words that he is receiving, the operator should\r\nhave a very sensitive manipulator at his disposal, and not be\r\nsubmitted to mental or physical overtaxation. So the apparatus that\r\nhave been devised have not met with much success.\r\n\r\nTwo French officers, working independently, have hit upon the same\r\nidea of receiving the indications transmitted by the vibration of the\r\nluminous fascicle directly upon their travel. The method consists in\r\nthe use of that peculiar property of selenium of becoming a good\r\nconductor under the action of a luminous ray, while in darkness it\r\ntotally prevents the passage of the electric current. Such\r\nmodification of the physical properties of selenium, moreover, occurs\r\nwithout the perceptible development of any mechanical work. If, then,\r\nin the line of travel of the luminous fascicle emitted by the optical\r\napparatus, or in a portion of such fascicle, we interpose a fragment\r\nof selenium connected with the two poles of a local pile, it is easy\r\nto see that the current from the latter will be opened or closed\r\naccording as the luminous ray from the apparatus will or will not\r\nstrike the selenium, and that the length of time during which the\r\ncurrent passes will depend upon the length of the luminous attacks. A\r\nMorse apparatus interposed in this annexed circuit will therefore give\r\nan automatic inscription of the correspondence exchanged. Such is the\r\nprinciple. But, practically, very great difficulties present\r\nthemselves, these being connected with the rapid weakening of the\r\nelectric properties of the selenium, and with the necessity of having\r\nrecourse to infinitely small mechanical actions only. The problem is\r\nnevertheless before us, and it is to be hoped that the perseverance of\r\nthe scientists who are at work upon it will some day succeed in\r\nsolving it.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may call attention to the attempts made to receive the\r\nluminous impression upon a band prepared with gelatino-bromide of\r\nsilver. In practice this band would unwind uniformly at the focus of\r\nthe receiving telescope, which would be placed in a box, forming a\r\ncamera obscura. The velocity of this band prepared for photographing\r\nthe signals would be regulated by clockwork. The experiments that have\r\nbeen made have not given results that are absolutely satisfactory, by\r\nreason of the length of the signals received and the mechanical\r\ncomplication of the device.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTICAL TELEGRAPHY BY MEANS OF PROJECTORS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe projectors employed for lighting to a distance the surroundings of\r\na stronghold or of a ship have likewise been applied in optical\r\ntelegraphy. For this purpose Messrs. Sautter, Lemonnier & Co. have\r\nadded to their usual projecting apparatus some peculiar arrangements\r\nthat permit of occultations of the luminous focus at proper intervals.\r\nFigs. 21 and 22 show the arrangement of the apparatus, the principle\r\nof which is as follows: When the axis of the projector points toward\r\nthe clouds, and in the direction occupied by a corresponding station,\r\nthe occultations of the luminous source placed in the focus of the\r\napparatus produce upon the clouds, which act as a screen, an alternate\r\nseries of flashes and extinctions. It is therefore possible with this\r\narrangement, and by the use of the Morse alphabet, to establish an\r\noptical communication at a distance. The use of this projector (the\r\nprincipal inconvenience of which is that it requires a clouded sky)\r\neven permits two observers who are hidden from each other by the\r\nnature of the ground to easily communicate at a distance of 36 or 48\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE PROJECTOR IN OPTICAL TELEGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 21 AND 22.--FRONT VIEW AND LONGITUDINAL SECTION\r\nOF THE MANGIN PROJECTOR.\r\n\r\n(Scale 1/15).

Screw for fixing the\r\noccultator support.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus shown in Figs. 21 and 22 permits of signaling in three\r\nways:\r\n\r\n1. _Upon the Clouds._--In this case the mirror, A, is removed, and the\r\nprojector inclined above the horizon in such a way as to illuminate\r\nthe clouds to as great a distance as possible. A maneuver of the\r\noccultator, E, between the lamp and the mirror arrests the luminous\r\nrays of the source, or allows them to pass, and thus produces upon the\r\nclouds the dots and dashes of the conventional alphabet.\r\n\r\n2. _Isolated Communication by Luminous Fascicles._--When it is desired\r\nto correspond to a short distance of 2 or 3 miles, and establish a\r\ncommunication between two isolated posts, the mirror, A, is put in\r\nplace upon its support, B. The luminous fascicle emanating from the\r\nsource reflected by the mirror is thrown vertically. By revolving the\r\nmirror 90° around its horizontal axis the fascicle becomes horizontal,\r\nand may thus be thrown in a given direction at unequal intervals and\r\nduring irregular times, and furnish conventional signs.\r\n\r\n3. _Night Communication upon the Entire Horizon._--When we wish to\r\ncorrespond at a short distance, say two miles, and make signals\r\nvisible from the entire horizon, the mirror, A, is put in place, so\r\nthat it shall reflect the luminous fascicle vertically. The fascicle,\r\nat a distance of about fifty feet, meets a white balloon which it\r\nrenders visible from every point in the horizon. The maneuver of the\r\noccultator brings the balloon out of darkness or plunges it thereinto\r\nagain, and thus produces the signs necessary for aerial communication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\nThese ingenious arrangements, which depend upon the state of the\r\natmosphere, do not appear to have been imitated outside of the navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPT. GAUMET'S OPTICAL TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nThe system of optical communication proposed by Capt. Gaumet, and\r\nwhich he names the _Telelogue_, is based upon the visibility of\r\ncolored or luminous objects, and upon the possibility of piercing the\r\nopaque curtain formed by the atmosphere between the observer's eye and\r\na signal, by utilizing the difference in brightness that exists\r\nbetween such objects and the atmosphere. It is a question, then, of\r\ngiving such difference in intensity its maximum of brightness. To do\r\nthis, Capt. Gaumet proposes to employ silvered signals upon a black\r\nbackground. He uses the simple letters of the alphabet, but changes\r\ntheir value. His apparatus has the form of a large album glued at the\r\nback to a sloping desk. Each silvered letter, glued to a piece of\r\nblack cloth, is seen in relief upon the open register. A sort of index\r\nalong the side, as in commercial blank-books, permits of quickly\r\nfinding any letter at will. Such is the manipulator of the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe receiver consists of a spy-glass affixed to the board that carries\r\nthe register. For a range of two and a half miles, the complete\r\napparatus, with a 12×16 inch manipulator and telescope, weighs but\r\nfour and a half pounds. For double this range, with a 20×28 inch\r\nmanipulator and telescope, the total weight is thirteen pounds. The\r\nlarger apparatus, according to the inventor, have a range of seven\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nFor night work the manipulator is lighted either by one lamp, or by\r\ntwo lamps with reflector, placed laterally against it.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, although well known, and having been publicly\r\nexperimented with, has not, to our knowledge, been applied\r\npractically. From a military standpoint, its short range will\r\nevidently not permit it to compete with optical telegraphic apparatus,\r\nproperly so called. Perhaps it might rather be of service for private\r\ncommunications between localities not very far apart, since it costs\r\nbut little and is easily operated.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTICAL SIGNALING BETWEEN BODIES OF TROOPS.\r\n\r\nOptical communications by signals, during day and night, with\r\nexperienced men, may, in the absence of telephones, telegraphs, and\r\nmessengers, render important service when the distance involved is\r\ngreater than two thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThis mode of correspondence is based upon the use of the Morse\r\nalphabet. The signals are divided into night and day ones. The day\r\nsignals are made with small flags. When these are wanting, sheets of\r\nwhite cardboard may be used. The night signals are made with a lantern\r\nprovided with a support, which may be fixed to a wall or upon a\r\nbayonet.\r\n\r\nIn day signaling, the dashes of the Morse alphabet are formed by means\r\nof two flags (Fig. 23) held simultaneously at arm's length by the\r\nsignaler. The dots are formed with a single flag held in the right\r\nhand (Fig. 24). In this way it is possible, by extremely simple\r\ncombinations, to establish a correspondence, and produce any\r\nconventional signal. By means of relay stations, the signals may be\r\ntransmitted from one to another to a great distance.\r\n\r\nIn signaling with the lantern, long and short interruptions of the\r\nluminous source are produced by means of a screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTICAL TELEGRAPHY BY LUMINOUS BALLOONS.\r\n\r\nVarious interesting experiments have been made with a view to\r\nutilizing luminous captive balloons for optical communications. As we\r\nhave already seen, this maybe effected by using opaque balloons, and\r\nthrowing upon them at unequal intervals a luminous fascicle by means\r\nof a projector. As for using a luminous source placed in the car of a\r\nballoon, that cannot be thought of in the present state of aeronautic\r\nscience; the continual rotation of the balloon around its axis would\r\nrender the projection and reception of the signals in a given\r\ndirection impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTICAL TELEGRAPHY IN THE MARINE.\r\n\r\nFor communicating optically from ship to ship during the day, the\r\nmarine uses flags of different forms and colors, and flames. Between\r\nships and the land there are used what are called semaphore signals,\r\nwhich are made by means of a mast provided with three arms and a disk\r\nplaced at the upper part. The combinations of signs thus obtained,\r\nwhich are analogous in principle to those of the Chappe telegraph,\r\npermit of satisfactorily communicating to a distance.\r\n\r\nOn board ship, hand signals are used like those employed by the army\r\nfor communicating between bodies of troops. For night communications\r\nthe marine employs lights corresponding to the day flags, as well as\r\nrockets, and luminous rays projected by means of reflectors and\r\nintercepted by screens.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be said that optical telegraphy, which has only\r\nwithin a few years emerged from the domain of theory to enter that of\r\npractice, has taken a remarkable stride in the military art and in\r\nscience. It is due to its processes that Col. Perrier has in recent\r\nyears been enabled to carry out certain geodesic work that would have\r\nformerly been regarded as impracticable, notably the prolongation of\r\nthe arc of the meridian between France and Spain. Very recently, an\r\noptical communication established between Mauritius and Reunion\r\nislands, to a distance of 129 miles, with 24 inch apparatus, proved\r\nthat, in certain cases, the costly laying of a submarine cable may be\r\nreplaced by the direct emission of a luminous ray.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW STYLE OF SUBMARINE TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. F. Von Faund-Szyll has devised an original system of submarine\r\ntelegraph, which is based upon the well known property that selenium\r\nexhibits of modifying its resistance under the influence of luminous\r\nrays, and which he styles the _Selen-Differenzialrecorder_.\r\n\r\nContrary to what is found in the other systems hitherto employed, the\r\nFaund-Szyll system utilizes the cable current merely for starting the\r\nreceiving apparatus, which are operated by means of strong local\r\nbatteries. The result is that the mechanical work that devolves upon\r\nthe line current, which is, as well known, very weak, is exceedingly\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nThe system consists of two essential parts: (1) The receiver, properly\r\nso called. (2) The relay as well as the registering apparatus or\r\n_differenzialrecorder_. The receiver consists of a closed box, K, in\r\nthe interior of which there is a very intense source of light whose\r\nrays escape by passing through apertures, _a a'_, in the front part\r\n(Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nAs a source of light, there may be conveniently employed an\r\nincandescent lamp, _g_, capable of giving an intense light, and\r\narranged (as shown in Fig. 2) behind the side that contains the slits,\r\n_a a'_.\r\n\r\nThe starting apparatus consists of a small galvanometric helix, _r_,\r\nanalogous to Thomson's siphon recorder, which is suspended from a\r\ncocoon fiber and capable of moving in an extremely powerful magnetic\r\nfield, N S. This helix carries, as may be seen in Figs. 1, 3 and 4, a\r\nprolongation, _v_, at its lower end whose form is that of a prism, and\r\nwhich is arranged in front of the partition of the box, K, in such a\r\nway that it exactly covers the two slits, a and _a_ when the bobbin is\r\nat rest, and in this case prevents the luminous rays of the lamp, _g_,\r\nfrom escaping from the box. But, as soon as the current sent through\r\nthe cable reaches the spirals of the bobbin, through the conductors,\r\n_y y'_, the sum of the elementary electrodynamic actions that arise\r\ncauses the helix to revolve to the right or left, according to the\r\npolarity of the current, while at the same time the helix slightly\r\napproaches one or the other of the poles of the magnet. The\r\nprolongation, _v_, of the helix, being firmly united with the latter,\r\nfollows it in its motion, and has the effect of permitting the\r\nluminous rays to escape through one or the other of the slits, _a a'_,\r\nso that the freeing of the luminous fascicle, if such an expression is\r\nallowable, is effected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent oscillations, which could not fail to occur after\r\neach emission of a current (so that the helix, instead of returning to\r\na position of equilibrium and stopping there, would go beyond it and\r\nalternately uncover the slits, _a a'_), the apparatus is provided with\r\na liquid deadener. To this end, the prolongation, _v_, carries a\r\npiece, _o_, which dips into a cup containing a mixture of glycerine\r\nand water.\r\n\r\nWe shall now describe the _differenzialrecorder_. Opposite the two\r\nslits, _a_ and _a'_, there are two powerful converging lenses, _l_ and\r\n_l'_, whose foci coincide with two sorts of selenium plate rheostat,\r\n_z_ and _z'_. The result of this arrangement is that as soon as one of\r\nthe slits, as a consequence of the displacement of the helix, _r_,\r\nallows a luminous fascicle to escape, this latter falls upon the\r\ncorresponding lens, which concentrates it and sends it to the selenium\r\nplates just mentioned. Under the influence of the luminous rays, the\r\nresistance that the selenium offers to the passage of an electric\r\ncurrent instantly changes. At M and M' are placed two horseshoe\r\nmagnets whose poles are provided with pieces of soft iron that serve\r\nas cores to exceedingly fine wire bobbins, _d_. These polarized pieces\r\nare arranged in the shape of a St. Andrew's cross, and in such a way\r\nthat the poles of the same name occupy the two extremities of the same\r\narm of the cross, an arrangement very clearly shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nBetween the poles of the magnets, M and M', there is a permanent\r\nmagnet, A, movable around a vertical axis, _i_. Four spiral springs,\r\n_f_, whose tension may be regulated, permit of centering this latter\r\npiece in such a way that when the current is traversing the spirals of\r\nthe polar bobbins it is equally distant from the four poles, _n_, _s_,\r\n_s'_, and _n'_. Under such circumstances it is evident that a\r\ndifference in the power of attraction of these four poles, however\r\nfeeble it be, will result in moving the magnet, A, in one direction or\r\nthe other around its axis. The energy and extent of such motion may,\r\nmoreover, be magnified by properly acting upon the four regulating\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nThe bobbins of the magnet, M, are mounted in series with the selenium\r\nplates, _z_, the local battery, B, and a resistance box, W. Those of\r\nthe magnet, M', are in series with _z'_, B', and W'. The local\r\nbatteries, B and B', are composed of quite a large number of elements.\r\nThe current from the battery, B, traverses the selenium plates and the\r\nbobbins of the magnet, M, and returns to B through the rheostat, W;\r\nand the same occurs with the current from B'. The two currents, then,\r\nare absolutely independent of one another.\r\n\r\nFrom this description it is very easy to see how the system works. Let\r\nus suppose, in fact, that the current which is traversing the spirals\r\nof the helix, _r_, has a direction such that the helix in its movement\r\napproaches the pole, S; then the prolongation, _v_, will uncover the\r\nslit, _a_, which, along with _a'_, had up to this moment been closed,\r\nand a luminous fascicle escaping through _a_ will strike the lens,\r\n_l'_, and from thence converge upon the selenium plates, _z'_. This is\r\nall the duty that the line current has to perform.\r\n\r\nThe luminous rays, in falling upon the selenium plates, _z'_, modify\r\nthe resistance that these offered to the passage of the current\r\nproduced by the battery, B'. As this resistance diminishes, the\r\nintensity of the current in the circuit supplied by the battery, B',\r\nincreases, the attractive action of the polar pieces of the magnet,\r\nM', diminishes, the equilibrium is destroyed, and the piece, A,\r\nrevolves around the axis, _i_. If the polarity of the line current\r\nwere different, the same succession of phenomena would occur, save\r\nthat the direction of A's rotation would be contrary. As for the\r\nrheostats, W W', their object is to correct variations in the\r\nselenium's resistance and to balance the resistances of the two\r\ncorresponding circuits. The magnet, A, will be combined with a\r\nregistering apparatus so as to directly or indirectly actuate the\r\nprinting lever. The entire first part of this apparatus, which is very\r\nsensitive, may be easily protected from all external influence by\r\nplacing it in a box, and, if need be, in a room distant from the one\r\nin which the employes work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 3 AND 4.]\r\n\r\nThe _differenzialrecorder_ alone has to be in the work room.\r\n\r\nAs may be seen, the system is not wanting in originality. Experience\r\nalone will permit of pronouncing upon the question as to whether it is\r\nas practical as ingenious.--_La Lumiere Electrique._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW CIRCUIT CUTTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Thomson & Bottomley have recently invented a peculiar circuit\r\ncutter based upon the use of a metal whose melting point is\r\nexceedingly low. Recourse is had to this process for breaking the\r\ncurrent within as short a time as possible. In this new device the\r\nends of the conductors are soldered together with the metal in\r\nquestion at one or several points of the circuit. The metal employed\r\nis silver or copper of very great conductivity, seeing that the\r\nincrease of temperature in a conductor, due to a sudden increase of\r\nthe current, is inversely proportional to the product of the electric\r\nresistance by the specific heat of the conductor; that these metals\r\nare best adapted for giving constant and definite results; and that\r\nthe contacts are better than with lead or the other metals of low\r\nmelting point which are frequently employed in circuit cutters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents one form of the new device. Here, a is the copper or\r\nsilver wire, and _b_ is a soldering made with a very fusible metal and\r\nsecuring a continuity of the circuit. Each extremity of the wire, _a_,\r\nis connected with a heavy ring, _c_, of copper or other good\r\nconducting metal. The hook, _d_, with which the upper ring, _c_, is in\r\ncontact, communicates metallically with one of the extremities of the\r\nconductor at the place where the latter is interrupted for the\r\ninsertion of the circuit cutter. The hook, _e_, with which the lower\r\nring, _c_, is in contact, tends constantly to descend under the action\r\nof a spiral spring, _f_, which is connected metallically with the\r\nother extremity of the principal conductor. The hooks, _d_ and _e_,\r\nare arranged approximately in the same vertical plane, and have a\r\nslightly rounded upper and lower surface, designed to prevent the\r\nrings, _c_, of the fusible wire, _a_, from escaping from the hooks. In\r\nFig. 1 the position of the arm, _e_, when there is no fusible wire in\r\ncircuit, is shown by dotted lines. When this arm occupies the position\r\nshown by entire lines, it exerts a certain traction upon the\r\nsoldering, _b_, and separates the two halves of the wire, _a_, as soon\r\nas the intensity of circulation exceeds its normal value. The mode of\r\nputting the wire with fusible soldering into circuit is clearly shown\r\nin the engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nFig. 2 shows a different mode of mounting the wire. The wire, _q_, is\r\nsoldered in the center, and is bent into the shape of a U, and kept in\r\nplace by the pieces, _r_ and _s_. In this way the two ends of it tend\r\nconstantly to separate from each other. Messrs. Thomson & Bottomley\r\nlikewise employ weights, simply, for submitting the wire to a constant\r\nstress. The apparatus is inclosed in a box provided with a glass\r\ncover.--_La Lumiere Electrique._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MICRO-TELEPHONIC APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the simplicity of their parts, and the slight value of the\r\nmaterials employed, the existing micro-telephonic apparatus keep at\r\nrelatively high prices, and the use of them is often rejected, to the\r\nbenefit of speaking tubes, when the distance between stations is not\r\ntoo great. We propose to describe a new style of apparatus that are in\r\nno wise inferior to those in general use, and the price of which is\r\nrelatively low.\r\n\r\nThe microphone transmitter may have several forms. The most elementary\r\nof these consists of two pieces of carbon, from one to one and a\r\nquarter inches in length by one-half inch in width, between which are\r\nfixed two _nails_, about two inches in length, whose extremities,\r\nfiled to a point, enter small conical apertures in the carbons. Fig. 1\r\ngives an idea of the arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nFig. 2 represents a model which is a little more complicated, but\r\nwhich gives remarkable results. The largest nail is here two inches in\r\nlength, and the shortest three-quarter inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe receivers may be Bell telephones of the simplest form found in the\r\nmarket (Fig. 3); but for these there may be substituted a bar of soft\r\niron, cast iron, or steel, one of the extremities of which is provided\r\nwith a bobbin upon, which is wound insulated copper wire 0.02 inch in\r\ndiameter. The apparatus is mounted like an ordinary Bell telephone. A\r\nhorseshoe electro may also be used, and the poles be made to act (Fig.\r\n4). The current sent by the transmitter suffices to produce a magnetic\r\nfield in which the variations in intensity produced by the microphone\r\nsucceed perfectly in reproducing speech and music. With four Leclanche\r\nelements, the sounds are perceived very clearly. The elements used may\r\nbe bichromate of potash ones, those of Lelande and Chaperon, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--RECEIVER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nTo this apparatus there may be added a second bobbin of coarser wire\r\ninto which is passed a current from a local pile. This produces a much\r\nintenser magnetic field, and, consequently, louder sounds. This\r\nmodification, however, is really useful only for long distances.\r\n\r\nAny arrangement imaginable may be given the transmitter and receiver;\r\nbut, aside from the fact that the ones just indicated are the\r\nsimplest, they give results that are at least equal, if not superior,\r\nto all others.\r\n\r\nWe shall insist here only upon the arrangement of the microphone,\r\nwhich is new (at least in practice), and upon the uselessness of\r\nhaving well magnetized steel bars and wires of extreme fineness in the\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nWe have stated that the nail microphones are the simplest. The nails\r\nmay be replaced by copper or any other metal, or they may be well\r\nnickelized; but common nails answer very well, and do not oxidize\r\nmuch. An apparatus of this kind (Fig. 5) that has been for more than a\r\nyear in a laboratory filled with acid vapors is yet working very well.\r\nThese apparatus possess the further advantage of being very strong,\r\nand of undergoing violent shocks without breaking or even getting out\r\nof order. They may be used either with or without induction coils. We\r\nhave not yet measured their range, but can cite the following fact:\r\n\r\nOne of these apparatus, quite crudely mounted, was put into a circuit\r\nwith a resistance of 300 ohms. With a single already exhausted\r\nbichromate element, giving scarcely 2 volts, musical sounds and speech\r\nreached the receiver without being notably weakened. Such resistance\r\nrepresents a length of eighteen miles of ordinary telegraph wire.\r\nAfter this, 700 ohms were overcome with 3.4 volts. This result was\r\nobtained by direct transmission, and without an induction coil, and it\r\nis probable that it might be much exceeded without sensibly increasing\r\nthe electromotive force of the current.--_Le Genie Civil._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSRS. KAPP AND CROMPTON'S MEASURING INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe give herewith, from the _Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift_, a few\r\ninteresting details in regard to the measuring apparatus of Messrs.\r\nKapp and Crompton.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that when we use permanent magnets or springs as\r\ndirecting forces in measuring instruments, we cannot count upon an\r\nabsolute constancy in the indications, as the magnetism of the\r\nmagnetized pieces, or the tension of the springs, modifies in time.\r\nThe apparatus require to be regulated from time to time, and hence the\r\nidea of substituting electro-magnets for permanent ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nIf we suppose (Fig. 1) a magnetized needle, _n s_, placed between the\r\nextremities of a soft iron core, N S, and if we group the circuit in\r\nsuch a way that the current, after traversing the coil, _e e_, of the\r\nelectro, traverses a circle, _d d_, situated in a plane at right\r\nangles with the plane of the needle's oscillation, it is evident that\r\nwe shall have obtained an apparatus that satisfies the aforesaid\r\nconditions. It seems at first sight that in such an instrument the\r\ndirecting force should be constant from the moment the electro was\r\nsaturated, and it would be possible, were sufficiently thin cores\r\nused, to obtain a constancy in the directing magnetic field for\r\nrelatively feeble intensities. In reality, the actions are more\r\ncomplex. The needle, _n s_, is, in fact, induced to return to its\r\nposition of equilibrium by two forces, the first of which (the\r\nattraction of the poles, N S) rapidly increases with the intensity so\r\nas to become quickly and perceptibly constant, while the second (the\r\nsum of the elementary electrodynamic actions that are exerted between\r\nthe spirals, _e e_, and the needle, _n s_) increases proportionally to\r\nthe intensity of the current. If we represent these two sections\r\ngraphically by referring the magnetic moments as ordinates and the\r\ncurrent intensities as abscissas to two co-ordinate axes (Fig. 2), we\r\nshall obtain for the first force the curve, O A B, which, starting\r\nfrom A, becomes sensibly parallel with the axis of X, and for the\r\nsecond the right line, O D. The resultant action is represented by the\r\ncurve, O E E'_F. It will be seen that this action, far from being\r\nconstant, increases quite rapidly with the intensity of the current,\r\nso that the deflections would become feebler and feebler for strong\r\nintensities, of current; and this, as well known, would render the\r\napparatus very defective from a practical point of view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nBut the action of the spirals can be annulled without sensibly\r\ndiminishing the magnetism of the core by arranging a second system of\r\nspirals identical with the first, but placed in a plane at right\r\nangles therewith, or, more simply still, by having a single system of\r\nspirals comprising the coil of the electro-magnet, but distributed in\r\na plane that is oblique with respect to the needle's position of rest.\r\nIt then becomes possible, by properly modifying such angle of\r\ninclination, to obtain a total directing action that shall continue to\r\nincrease with the intensity, and which, graphically represented, shall\r\ngive the curve, O G G'_H, for example (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nThis arrangement, which is adopted in Mr. Kapp's instruments, gives\r\nvery good results, as may be easily seen by reference to Figs. 3 and\r\n4, in which the current intensities or differences of potential are\r\nreferred as ordinates and the degrees of deflection of the needle as\r\nabscissas. The unbroken lines represent the curves obtained with the\r\napparatus just described, while the dotted ones give the curve of\r\ndeflection of an ordinary tangent galvanometer. These curves show that\r\nfor strong intensities of current Mr. Kapp's instrument is more\r\nadvantageous than the tangent galvanometer. Mr. Crompton has\r\nconstructed an amperemeter upon the same principle, which is shown in\r\nFig. 5.--_La Lumiere Electrique._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMICAL ACTION OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor A. Vogel, in a communication to the \"Sitzungsberichte der\r\nMunchener Akademie,\" brings into prominence the fact that the hemlock\r\nplant, which yields coniine in Bavaria, contains none in Scotland.\r\nHence he concludes that solar light plays a part in the generation of\r\nthe alkaloids in plants. This view is corroborated by the circumstance\r\nthat the tropical cinchonas, if cultivated in our feebly lighted\r\nhothouses, yield scarcely any alkaloids. Prof. Vogel has proved this\r\nexperimentally. He has examined the barks of cinchona plants obtained\r\nfrom different conservatories, but has not found in any of them the\r\ncharacteristic reaction of quinine. Of course it is still possible\r\nthat quinine might be discovered in other conservatory-grown\r\ncinchonas, especially as the specimens operated upon were not fully\r\ndeveloped. But as the reaction employed indicates very small\r\nquantities of quinine, it may be safely assumed that the barks\r\nexamined contained not a trace of this alkaloid, and it can scarcely\r\nbe doubted that the deficiency of sunlight in our hothouses is one of\r\nthe causes of the deficiency of quinine.\r\n\r\nIt will at once strike the reader as desirable that specimens of\r\ncinchonas should be cultivated in hothouses under the influence of the\r\nelectric light, in addition to that of the sun.\r\n\r\nIf sunlight can be regarded as a factor in the formation of alkaloids\r\nin the living plant, it has, on the other hand, a decidedly injurious\r\naction upon the quinine in the bark stripped from the tree. On drying\r\nsuch bark in full sunlight the quinine is decomposed, and there are\r\nformed dark-colored, amorphous, resin-like masses. In the manufacture\r\nof quinine the bark is consequently dried in darkness.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar behavior of quinine on exposure to sunlight finds its\r\nparallel in the behavior of chlorophyl with the direct rays of the\r\nsun. It is well known that the origin of chlorophyl in the plant is\r\nentirely connected with light, so that etiolated leaves growing in the\r\ndark form no chlorophyl. But as soon as chlorophyl is removed from the\r\nsphere of vegetable life, a brief exposure to the direct rays of the\r\nsun destroys its green color completely.\r\n\r\nProf. A. Vogel conjectures that the formation of tannin in the living\r\nplant is to some extent influenced by light. This supposition is\r\nsupported by the fact that the proportion of tannin in beech or larch\r\nbark increases from below upward--that is, from the less illuminated\r\nto the more illuminated parts, and this in the proportions of 4:6 and\r\n5:10.\r\n\r\nSunny mountain slopes of a medium height yield, according to wide\r\nexperience, on an average the pine-barks richest in tannin. In woods\r\nin level districts the proportion of tannin is greatest in localities\r\nexposed to the light, while darkness seems to have an unfavorable\r\neffect. Here, also, we must refer to the observation that leaves\r\nexceptionally exposed to the light are relatively rich in tannin.\r\n\r\nWe may here add that in the very frequent cases where a leaf is\r\nshadowed by another in very close proximity, or where a portion of a\r\nleaf has been folded over by some insect, the portion thus shaded\r\nretains a pale green color, while adjacent leaves, or other portions\r\nof the same leaf, assume their yellow, red, or brown autumnal tints.\r\nIf, as seems highly probable, these tints are due to transformation\r\nproducts of tannin, we may not unnaturally conclude that they will be\r\nabsent where tannin has not been generated.--_Jour. of Science._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEUTEXIA.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: Read before the Birmingham Philosophical Society,\r\n   January 22, 1885.]\r\n\r\nBy THOMAS TURNER, Assoc. R.S.M., F.C.S., Demonstrator of Chemistry,\r\nMason College.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a number of interesting facts, some of which are known to\r\nmost persons, and many of them have been long recognized, of which,\r\nhowever, it must be owned that the explanation is somewhat obscure,\r\nand the connections existing between them have been but recently\r\npointed out. As an example of this, it is well known that salt water\r\nfreezes at a lower temperature than fresh water, and hence sea-water\r\nmay be quite liquid while rivers and ponds are covered with ice.\r\nAgain, it is noticed that mixtures of salts often have a fusing-point\r\nlower than that of either of the constituent salts, and of this fact\r\nwe often take advantage in fluxing operations. Further, it is well\r\nknown that certain alloys can be prepared, the melting-points of which\r\nare lower than the melting-point of either of the constituent metals\r\nalone. Thus, while potassium melts at 62.5° C., and sodium at about\r\n98°, an alloy of these metals is fluid at ordinary temperatures, and\r\nfusible metal melts below the temperature of boiling water, or more\r\nthan 110° lower than the melting-point of tin, the most fusible of the\r\nthree metals which enter into the composition of this alloy. But\r\nthough these and many similar facts have been long known, it is but\r\nrecently, owing largely to the labors of Dr. Guthrie, that fresh\r\ntruths have been brought to light, and a connection shown to exist\r\nthroughout the whole which was previously unseen, though we have still\r\nto acknowledge that at present there is much at the root of the matter\r\nwhich is but imperfectly understood. Still Dr. Guthrie proves a\r\nrelationship to exist between the several facts we have previously\r\nmentioned, and also between a number of other phenomena which at first\r\nsight appear to be equally isolated and unexpected, and we are asked\r\nto regard them all as examples of what he has called \"eutexia.\"\r\n\r\nWe may define a eutectic substance as a body composed of two or more\r\nconstituents, which constituents are in such proportion to one another\r\nas to give to the resultant compound body a minimum temperature of\r\nliquefaction--that is, a lower temperature of liquefaction than that\r\ngiven by any other proportion.[2] It will be seen at once by this\r\ndefinition that the temperature of liquefaction of a eutectic\r\nsubstance is lower than the temperature of liquefaction of either or\r\nany of the constituents of the mixture. And, further, it is plain that\r\nthose substances only can be eutectic which we can obtain both as\r\nliquid and solid, and hence the property of eutexia is closely\r\nconnected with solution.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 2: Guthrie, _Phil. Mag._ [5], xvii., p. 462.]\r\n\r\nFollowing in the natural divisions adopted by Dr. Guthrie, we may\r\nconsider eutexia in three aspects:\r\n\r\n\r\nI. CRYOHYDRATES.\r\n\r\nIf a _dilute_ aqueous saline solution be taken at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, and then slowly cooled to some point below zero on the\r\nCentigrade scale, the following series of changes will in general be\r\nobserved: On reaching a point below zero, the position of which is\r\ndependent upon the nature of the salt and the amount of dilution, it\r\nwill be found that ice is formed; this will float upon the surface of\r\nthe solution, and may be readily removed. If the ice so removed be\r\nafterward pressed, or carefully drained, it will be found to consist\r\nof nearly pure water, the liquid draining away being a strong saline\r\nsolution which had become mechanically entangled among the crystals of\r\nice during solidification. If we further cool the brine which remains,\r\nwe notice a tolerably uniform fall of temperature with accompanying\r\nformation of ice. But at length a point is reached at which the\r\ntemperature ceases to fall until the whole of the remaining\r\nmother-liquor has solidified, with the production of a compound called\r\na cryohydrate,[3] which possesses physical properties different from\r\nthose of either the ice or the salt from which it is formed.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 3: Guthrie, _Phil. Mag._, 4th Series, xlix., pp. 1,\r\n   206, 266; 5th Series, i., pp. 49, 354, 446, vi., p. 35.]\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we commence with a _saturated_ saline solution,\r\nin general it is noticed on cooling the liquid a separation of salt\r\nensues, which salt sinks to the bottom of the mass, and may be\r\nremoved. The salt so separating may be either anhydrous or a \"hydrate\"\r\nof greater concentration than the mother-liquor. So long as this\r\nseparation proceeds the temperature falls, but at length a point is\r\nreached at which the thermometer remains stationary until the whole is\r\nsolidified, with the production of a cryohydrate. This temperature of\r\nsolidification is the same whether we start with a dilute or a\r\nsaturated solution, and the composition of the cryohydrate is found to\r\nbe constant. The temperature of production of the cryohydrate is\r\nidentical with the lowest temperature which can be produced on\r\nemploying a mixture of ice and the salt as a freezing mixture or\r\ncryogen.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily seen that in the formation of a cryohydrate we have\r\nan example of eutexia, since the constituents are present in such\r\nproportion as to give to the resultant compound body a minimum\r\ntemperature of liquefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. EUTECTIC SALT ALLOYS.[4]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 4: F. Guthrie, _Phil. Mag._ [5], xvii., p. 469; F.B.\r\n   Guthrie, _Journ. Chem. Soc_,. 1885, p. 94.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been long known that on mixing certain salts the\r\nresulting substance possessed a lower melting-point than either of the\r\nconstituent salts alone, still but few determinations of the\r\nmelting-points of mixtures of salts have been made, and even these are\r\noften of small value, on account of the very considerable range of\r\ntemperature observed during solidification. This is due largely to the\r\nfact that eutectic mixtures were not known, as equivalent proportions\r\nof various salts have been employed, while eutectic mixtures are\r\nseldom found to possess any simple arithmetical molecular relationship\r\nbetween their constituents.\r\n\r\nEutectic salt alloys closely resemble cryohydrates in behavior. If for\r\nsimplicity we confine our attention to a fused mixture of two salts in\r\nany proportion other than eutectic, it is found that, on cooling, the\r\nthermometer falls steadily, until at length that salt which is in\r\nexcess of the proportion required for a eutectic mixture begins to\r\nseparate out. If this is removed, the thermometer falls until a fixed\r\npoint is reached at which the temperature remains stationary until the\r\nwhole of the mixture solidifies. On remelting, the temperature of\r\nsolidification is found to be quite fixed, and the mixture is\r\nevidently eutectic.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to notice that from our knowledge of the\r\ncryohydrates it becomes possible to predict the existence,\r\ncomposition, and temperature of solidification of a eutectic alloy, if\r\nwe are previously furnished with the melting-points of mixtures of the\r\nsubstances in question. Or, in other cases, we may predict from the\r\ncurve of melting-points that no eutectic alloy is possible.\r\n\r\nAs an example, we may take the determinations of the melting-points of\r\nmixtures of potassium and sodium nitrate by M. Maumené.[5] These are\r\ngraphically represented in Fig. 1, the curve being derived from the\r\nmean of the temperatures given in the memoir. From this diagram we\r\nshould be led to expect a eutectic mixture, since the curve dips below\r\na horizontal line passing through the melting-point of the more\r\nfusible of its constituents. From our curve we should expect a\r\neutectic mixture with about 35 per cent. KNO_{3}, and with a\r\ntemperature of solidification below 233°. Dr. Guthrie gives 32.9 per\r\ncent. at 215°. This agreement is as good as might be expected when one\r\nremembers that the melting-points, not being of eutectic mixtures, are\r\ndifficult to determine, and a considerable range is given; that\r\nanalyses of mixtures of potassium and sodium salts are apt to vary;\r\nand that the two observers differ by ±7° in the temperatures given for\r\nthe melting-points of the original salts.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 5: _Comptes Rendus_, 1883, 2, p. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nDr. Tilden has drawn my attention to an interesting example of the\r\nlowering of melting-point by the mixture of salts. The melting-point\r\nof monohydrochloride of turpentine oil is 125°, while that of the\r\ndihydrochloride is 50°; but on simply stirring together these\r\ncompounds in a mortar at common temperatures, they immediately\r\nliquefy. Two molecules of the monohydrochloride and one molecule of\r\nthe dihydrochloride form a mixture which melts at about 20°.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EUTECTIC METALLIC ALLOYS.\r\n\r\nAlthough many fusible alloys have been long known, I believe no true\r\neutectic metallic alloy had been studied until Dr. Guthrie[6] worked\r\nat the subject, employing the same methods as with his cryohydrates.\r\nIt is found if two metals are fused together and the mixture allowed\r\nto cool, that the temperature falls until a point is reached at which\r\nthat metal which is present in a proportion greater than is required\r\nto form the eutectic alloy begins to separate. If this solid be\r\nremoved as it forms, the temperature gradually falls until a fixed\r\npoint is reached, at which the eutectic alloy solidifies. Here the\r\nthermometer remains stationary until the whole has become solid, and,\r\non remelting, this temperature is found to be quite fixed. In addition\r\nto the di-eutectic alloys, we have also tri- and tetra-eutectic\r\nalloys, and as an example of the latter we may take the\r\nbismuth-tin-lead-cadmium eutectic alloy, melting at 71°.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 6: _Phil. Mag._, 5th Series, xvii., p. 462.]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen with salt eutectics that, given the curve of\r\nmelting-points of a mixture in various proportions, we may predict the\r\nexistence, composition, and melting-point of the eutectic alloy. As a\r\nmatter of course, the same thing holds good for metallic eutectics. An\r\ninteresting example of this is furnished by the tin-lead alloys, the\r\nmelting-points of which have been determined by Pillichody.[7] From\r\nthese determinations we obtain the curve given in Fig. 2, and from\r\nthis curve, since it dips below a horizontal line passing through the\r\nmelting-point of the more fusible constituent, we are at once able to\r\npredict a eutectic alloy. We should further expect this to have a\r\nconstitution between PbSn_{3} and PbSn_{4} and a melting-point\r\nsomewhat below 181°. On melting together tin and lead, and allowing\r\nthe alloy to cool, we find our expectation justified; for by pouring\r\noff the fluid portion which remains after solidification has\r\ncommenced, and repeating this several times with the portion so\r\nremoved, we at length obtain an alloy which solidifies at the constant\r\ntemperature of 180°, when the melting-point of tin is taken as 228°.\r\nOn analysis 1.064 grm. of this alloy gave 0.885 grm. SnO_{2}, which\r\ncorresponds to Sn 65.43 per cent., or PbSn_{3.3}. This, therefore, is\r\nthe composition of the eutectic alloy, and it finds its place\r\nnaturally on the curve given in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 7: _Dingler's Polyt. Journ._, 162, p. 217;\r\n   _Jahresberichte_, 1861, p. 279.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the subject of eutexia embraces many points of\r\npractical importance and of theoretical interest. Thus it has been\r\nshown by Dr. Guthrie that the desilverizing of lead in Pattinson's\r\nprocess is but a case of eutexia, the separation of lead on cooling a\r\nbath of argentiferous lead poor in silver being analogous to the\r\nseparation of ice from a salt solution. Dr. Guthrie has also shown\r\nthat eutexia may reasonably be supposed to have played an important\r\npart in the production and separation of many rock-forming minerals.\r\n\r\nIt is with considerable diffidence that I suggest the following as an\r\nexplanation of the multitude of facts to which previous reference has\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nIn a mixture of two substances, A and B, we have the following forces\r\nactive, tending to produce solidification:\r\n\r\n    1. The cohesion between the particles of A.\r\n\r\n    2. The cohesion between the particles of B.\r\n\r\n    3. The cohesion between the particles of A and the particles of B.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this last factor, it will be seen that there are three\r\ncases possible:\r\n\r\n    1. The cohesion of the mixture A B may be greater than the\r\n    cohesion of A + the cohesion of B.\r\n\r\n    2. The cohesion of A B may be equal to the cohesion of A + the\r\n    cohesion of B.\r\n\r\n    3. The cohesion of A B may be less than the cohesion of A + the\r\n    cohesion of B.\r\n\r\nNow, since cohesion tends to produce solidification, we should in the\r\nfirst case expect to find the melting-point of the mixture _higher_\r\nthan the mean of the melting-points of its constituents, or the curve\r\nof melting-points would be of the form given in _a_, Fig. 3. Here no\r\neutectic mixture is possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nIn the second case, where cohesion A B = cohesion A + B, we should\r\nobtain melting-points for the mixture which would agree with the mean\r\nof the melting-points of the constituents, the curve of melting-points\r\nwould be a straight line, and again no eutectic mixture would be\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIn the third case, however, where cohesion A B is less than cohesion A\r\n+ B, we should find the melting-points of the mixture lower than the\r\nmean of the melting-points of its constituents, and the curve of\r\nmelting-points would be of the form given in _e_, Fig. 3. Here, in\r\nthose cases where the difference of cohesion on mixture is\r\nconsiderable, the curve of melting-points may dip below the line _e\r\nf_. This is the _only case_ in which a eutectic mixture is possible,\r\nand it is, of course, found at the lowest point of the curve.\r\n\r\nIf it be true, as above suggested, that the force of cohesion is at\r\nits minimum in the eutectic alloy, we should expect to find, in\r\npreparing a eutectic substance, either that actual expansion took\r\nplace, or that the molecular volume would gradually increase in\r\npassing along our curve of melting-points, from either end, for each\r\nmolecule added, and that it would obtain its greatest value at the\r\npoint corresponding to the eutectic alloy.\r\n\r\nOf this I have no direct evidence as yet, but it is a point of\r\nconsiderable interest, and I may possibly return to it at some future\r\ntime.--_Chemical News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINOLINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Conrad Berens, of the University of Pennsylvania, reaches the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n 1.

It lessens and finally abolishes reflex action by a direct action\r\nupon the cord, and by a slight action upon the muscles and nerves.\r\n\r\n 6. It diminishes or abolishes muscular contractility respectively\r\nwhen applied through the circulation or directly.\r\n\r\n 7. It coagulates myosin and albumen.\r\n\r\n 8. It causes insalivation by paralysis of the secretory fibers of the\r\nchorda tympani; increases the flow of bile; has no action upon the\r\nspleen.\r\n\r\n 9. It lowers blood-pressure by paralyzing the vaso-motor centers and\r\nby a direct depressant action upon the heart muscle.\r\n\r\n 10. It diminishes the pulse rate by direct action upon the heart.\r\n\r\n 11. It lowers the temperature by increasing the loss of heat.\r\n\r\n 12. It is a powerful antiseptic; and, finally,\r\n\r\n 13.

In perfecting and\r\ntesting it I was assisted greatly by J. Torrey, Jr., then working with\r\nme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of the glass tube, A, which is about 8 cm. long\r\nand 2½ cm. in diameter, joined to the tube, B, which is about 25 or 30\r\ncm. in length in its longer arm and 8 or 10 in its shorter, and has a\r\ndiameter of about 5 mm. Near the bend is an outlet tube, _c_, provided\r\nwith \"ball valve\" or pinch cock. _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_, are marks upon the\r\ntubes. C is a rubber cork with two holes through which the bent tube,\r\nD, passes. D is of such size and length as to hold about 1 c.c., and\r\none of its ends may be a trifle longer than the other.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is used as follows: Remove the cork and pour in mercury\r\nuntil it stands at _e_ and _g_, then fill up to the mark, _f_, with\r\nsodium or potassium hypobromite (made by shaking up bromine with a\r\nstrong solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide). Next carefully fill\r\nthe tube in the cork with the urine, being careful especially not to\r\nrun it over or leave air bubbles in it. This can easily be done by\r\nusing a small pipette, but if accidentally a little runs over, it\r\nshould be wiped off the end of the cork with blotting paper. The cork\r\nis then to be inserted closely into the tube; the urine tube being so\r\nsmall, the urine will not run out in so doing. The mercury is then\r\ndrawn out through _c_ till it stands in B at _d_. Its level in A will\r\nof course not be changed greatly. Now, incline the apparatus till the\r\nsurface of the hypobromite touches the urine in the longer part of the\r\nurine tube, and then bring it upright again. The urine will thus be\r\ndischarged into the hypobromite, which will of course decompose the\r\nurea, liberating nitrogen, which will cause the mercury to rise in B.\r\nShake until no further change of level is seen, and mark the level of\r\nmercury in B with a rubber band, then remove the cork, draw out the\r\nliquid with a pipette, dry out the tube above the mercury with scrap\r\nof blotting paper, pour back the mercury drawn out, and repeat the\r\nprocess to be sure that no error was made.\r\n\r\nIf now two or three marks have been made upon the tube, B, indicating\r\nthe height of the mercury when solutions containing known per cents.\r\nof urea are used, an accurate opinion can be at once formed as to the\r\ncondition of the urine as regards urea.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, normal urine contains about 2.5-3 per cent. of urea,\r\nso that graduations representing 2, 2.5, 3, and 4 per cent. are\r\nusually all that are needed, though of course many more can be easily\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained with this apparatus have been repeatedly compared\r\nwith those of more elaborate ones, and no practical difference\r\nobserved. Evidently the same apparatus, differently graduated, might\r\nbe employed to determine the carbonate present in such a substance as\r\ncrude soda ash or other similar mixture. In such a case the weighed\r\nmaterial would be put upon the mercury with water and the small tube\r\nfilled with acid.\r\n\r\nBowdoin College Chemical Laboratory.--_F.C. Robinson, in Amer.
