GROOM-NAPIER, F.G.S., &c.\r\n\r\n    WITH 427 ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n    LONDON:\r\n    CASSELL, PETTER, AND GALPIN;\r\n    AND 596, BROADWAY, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Our Planet is surrounded by two great oceans,\" says Dr. Maury, the\r\neminent American _savant_: \"the one visible, the other invisible; one is\r\nunder foot, the other over head. One entirely envelopes it, the other\r\ncovers about two-thirds of its surface.\" It is proposed in \"THE OCEAN\r\nWORLD\" to give a brief record of the Natural History of one of those\r\ngreat oceans and its living inhabitants, with as little of the\r\nnomenclature of Science, and as few of the repulsive details of Anatomy,\r\nas is consistent with clearness of expression; to describe the ocean in\r\nits majestic calm and angry agitation; to delineate its inhabitants in\r\ntheir many metamorphoses; the cunning with which they attack or evade\r\ntheir enemies; their instructive industry; their quarrels, their\r\ncombats, and their loves.\r\n\r\nThe learned Schleiden eloquently paints the living wonders of the deep:\r\n\"If we dive into the liquid crystal of the Indian Ocean, the most\r\nwondrous enchantments are opened to us, reminding us of the fairy tales\r\nof childhood's dreams. The strangely-branching thickets bear living\r\nflowers. Dense masses of _Meandrineas_ and _Astreas_ contrast with the\r\nleafy, cup-shaped expansions of the _Explanarias_, and the\r\nvariously-branching _Madrepores_, now spread out like fingers, now\r\nrising in trunk-like branches, and now displaying an elegant array of\r\ninterlacing tracery. The colouring surpasses everything; vivid greens\r\nalternate with brown and yellow; rich tints, ranging from purple and\r\ndeepest blue to a pale reddish-brown. Brilliant rose, yellow, or\r\npeach-coloured _Nullipores_ overgrow the decaying masses: they\r\nthemselves being interwoven with the pearl-coloured plates of the\r\n_Retipores_, rivalling the most delicate ivory carvings. Close by wave\r\nthe yellow and lilac Sea-fans (_Gorgonia_), perforated like delicate\r\ntrellis-work. The bright sand of the bottom is covered with a thousand\r\nstrange forms of sea-urchins and star-fishes. The leaf-like _Flustræ_\r\nand _Escharæ_ adhere like mosses and lichens to the branches of\r\ncoral--the yellow, green, and purple-striped limpets clinging to their\r\ntrunks. The sea-anemones expand their crowns of tentacula upon the\r\nrugged rocks or on flat sands, looking like beds of variegated\r\nranunculuses, or sparkling like gigantic cactus blossoms, shining with\r\nbrightest colours.\r\n\r\n\"Around the branches of the coral shrubs play the humming-birds of the\r\nocean: little fishes sparkling with red or blue metallic glitter, or\r\ngleaming in golden green or brightest silvery lustre; like spirits of\r\nthe deep, the delicate milk-white jelly-fishes float softly through the\r\ncharmed world. Here gleam the violet and gold-green Isabelle, and the\r\nflaming yellow, black, and vermilion-striped Coquette, as they chase\r\ntheir prey; there the band-fish shoots snake-like through the thicket,\r\nresembling a silvery ribbon glittering with rose and azure hue. Then\r\ncome the fabulous cuttle-fishes, in all the diaphanous colours of the\r\nrainbow, but with no definite outline.\r\n\r\n\"When day declines, with the shades of night this fantastic garden is\r\nlighted up with renewed splendour. Millions of microscopic medusæ and\r\ncrustaceans, like so many glowing sparks, dance through the gloom. The\r\nSea-pen waves in a greenish phosphorescent light. Whatever is beautiful\r\nor wondrous among _fishes_, _Echinoderms_, _jelly-fishes_ and _polypi_\r\nand _molluscs_, is crowded into the warm and crystal waters of the\r\nTropical ocean.\"\r\n\r\nIt is stated on the Title-page that \"THE OCEAN WORLD\" is chiefly\r\ntranslated from M. Louis Figuier's two most recent works. In justice to\r\nthat gentleman, we must explain this statement. The History of the Ocean\r\nis to a large extent, but not wholly, compiled from \"La Terre et les\r\nMers,\" one of the volumes of M. Figuier's \"Tableau de la Nature;\" but\r\nthe larger portion of the work is a free translation of that author's\r\nlatest work, \"La Vie et les Moeurs des Animaux.\" Other chapters, such as\r\n\"Life in the Ocean,\" the chapter on Crustaceans, and some others, are\r\ncompiled from various sources; they will not be found in either of M.\r\nFiguier's volumes; but in other respects his text has been pretty\r\nclosely followed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Figuier's plan is to begin the study of animals with the less perfect\r\nbeings occupying the lower rounds of the Zoological ladder, his reason\r\nfor doing so being an impression that the presence of the gradually\r\nperfecting animal structure, from the simplest organisms up to the more\r\nperfect forms, was specially calculated to attract the reader. \"What can\r\nbe more curious or more interesting to the mind,\" he asks, \"than to\r\nexamine the successive links in the uninterrupted chain of living beings\r\nwhich commence with the Infusoria and terminate in Man?\"\r\n\r\nThe work, he hopes, is not without the impress of a true character of\r\nnovelty and originality; at least he knows no work in which the strange\r\nhabits and special interests of the Zoophytes and Molluscs can be\r\nstudied, nor any work in which an attempt is made to represent them by\r\nmeans of designs at once scientifically correct and attractive from the\r\npicturesque character of the illustrations, most of which have been made\r\nfrom specimens selected by Monsieur Ch. Bévalet from the various museums\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\nOne of those charming plain-speaking children we sometimes meet with\r\nlately said to M. Figuier, \"They tell me thou art a vulgariser of\r\nScience. What is that?\"\r\n\r\nHe took the child in his arms, and carried it to the window, where there\r\nwas a beautiful rose-tree in blossom, and invited it to pull a rose. The\r\nchild gathered the perfumed flower, not without pricking itself cruelly\r\nwith the spines; then, with its little hands still bleeding, it went to\r\ndistribute roses to others in the room.\r\n\r\n\"Thou art now a vulgariser,\" said he to the child; \"for thou takest to\r\nthyself the thorns, and givest the flowers to others!\"\r\n\r\nThe parallel, although exaggerated, is not without its basis of truth,\r\nand was probably suggested by the criticism some of his works have met\r\nwith; the critics forgetting apparently that these works are an attempt\r\nto render scientific subjects popular, and attractive to the general\r\nreader.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the present edition of \"THE OCEAN WORLD\" it is only necessary to add\r\nto the above (dated January, 1868), that the work has been revised\r\nthroughout, and some not unimportant errors corrected. For several of\r\nthese I am indebted to Mr. C. O. G. Napier, who has rearranged the whole\r\nof the Mollusca. Mr. David Grieve has kindly revised and added to the\r\nCrustacea; and to the Messrs. Johnston of Montrose, and Dr. Wilson\r\nJohnston of the Bengal service, I am indebted for some valuable\r\npractical information respecting the salmon and the various modes of\r\ntaking it.\r\n\r\n    W.

The calculation, as given by astronomers, is as follows: The\r\nsurface of the earth is 31,625,625 ½ square miles, that portion\r\noccupied by the waters being about 23,814,121 square miles, and that\r\nconsisting of continents, peninsulas, and islands, being 7,811,504\r\nmiles; whence it follows that the surface covered with water is to dry\r\nland as 3·8 is to 1·2. The waters thus cover a little more than\r\nseven-tenths of the whole surface. \"On the surface of the globe,\"\r\nMichelet remarks, \"water is the rule, dry land the exception.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the immensity and depth of the seas are aids rather than\r\nobstacles to the intercourse and commerce of nations; the maritime\r\nroutes are now traversed by ships and steamers conveying cargoes and\r\npassengers equal in extent to the land routes. One of the features most\r\ncharacteristic of the ocean is its continuity; for, with the exception\r\nof inland seas, such as the Caspian, the Dead Sea, and some others, the\r\nocean is one and indivisible. As the poet says, \"it embraces the whole\r\nearth with an uninterrupted wave.\"\r\n\r\n    Περὶ πᾶσαν θ' εἱλισσομένου\r\n    χθόν' ἀκοιμἡτω ῥεύματι.\r\n\r\n    ÆSCHYLUS in _Prometheus Vinctus_.\r\n\r\nThe mean depth of the sea is not very exactly ascertained, but certain\r\nphenomena observed in the movement of tides are supposed to be incapable\r\nof explanation without admitting a mean depth of three thousand five\r\nhundred fathoms. It is true that a great number of deep-sea soundings\r\nfall short of that limit; but, on the other hand, many others reach\r\nseven or eight thousand. Admitting that three thousand fathoms\r\nrepresents the mean depth of the ocean, Sir John Herschel finds that the\r\nvolume of its waters would exceed three thousand two hundred and\r\nseventy-nine million cubic yards.\r\n\r\nThis vast volume of water is divided by geographers into five great\r\noceans: the Arctic, the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, and Antarctic Oceans.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Ocean extends from the Pole to the Polar Circle; it is\r\nsituated between Asia, Europe, and America.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic Ocean commences at the Polar Circle and reaches Cape Horn.\r\nIt is situated between America, Europe, and Africa, a length of about\r\nnine thousand miles, with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundred,\r\ncovering a surface of about twenty-five million square miles, placed\r\nbetween the Old World and the New. Beyond the Cape of Storms, as Cape\r\nHorn may be truly called, it is only separated by an imaginary line from\r\nthe vast seas of the south, in which the waves, which are the principal\r\nsource of _tides_, have their birth. Here, according to Maury, the young\r\ntidal wave, rising in the circumpolar seas of the south, and obedient to\r\nthe sun and moon, rolls on to the Atlantic, and in twelve hours after\r\npassing the parallel of Cape Horn is found pouring its flood into the\r\nBay of Fundy, whence it is projected in great waves across the Atlantic\r\nand round the globe, sweeping along its shores and penetrating its gulfs\r\nand estuaries, rising and falling in the open sea two or three feet, but\r\nalong the shore having a range of ten or twelve feet. Sometimes, as at\r\nFundy on the American coast; at Brest on the French coast; and Milford\r\nHaven, and the mouth of the Severn in the Bristol Channel, rising and\r\nfalling thirty or forty feet, \"impetuously rushing against the shores,\r\nbut gently stopping at a given line, and flowing back to its place when\r\nthe word goes forth, 'Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.' That\r\nwhich no human power can repel, returns at its appointed time so\r\nregularly and surely, that the hour of its approach and the measure of\r\nits mass may be predicted with unerring certainty centuries beforehand.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian Ocean is bounded on the north by Asia, on the west by Africa,\r\non the east by the peninsula of Molucca, the Sunda Isles, and\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific, or Great Ocean, stretches from north to south, from the\r\nArctic to the Antarctic Circle, being bounded on one side by Asia, the\r\nisland of Sunda, and Australia; on the other by the west coast of\r\nAmerica. This ocean contrasts in a striking manner with the Atlantic:\r\nthe one has its greatest length from north to south, the other from east\r\nto west; the currents of the Pacific are broad and slow, those of the\r\nother narrow and rapid; the waves of this are low, those of the other\r\nvery high. If we represent the volume of water which falls into the\r\nPacific by one, that received by the Atlantic will be represented by the\r\nfigure 5. The Pacific is the calmest of seas, and the Atlantic Ocean is\r\nthe most stormy.\r\n\r\nThe Antarctic Ocean extends from the Antarctic Polar Circle to the South\r\nPole.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that one half of the globe should be entirely covered\r\nwith water, whilst the other contains less of water than dry land.\r\nMoreover, the distribution of land and water, if, in considering the\r\ngerm of the oceanic basins, we compare the hemispheres separated by the\r\nEquator and the northern and southern halves of the globe, is found to\r\nbe very unequal.\r\n\r\nOceans communicate with continents and islands by coasts, which are said\r\nto be scarped when a rocky coast makes a steep and sudden descent to the\r\nsea, as in Brittany, Norway, and the west coast of the British Islands.\r\nIn this kind of coast certain rocky indentations encircle it, sometimes\r\nabove, sometimes under water, forming a labyrinth of islands, as at the\r\nLand's End, Cornwall, where the Scilly Islands form a compact group of\r\nfrom one to two hundred rocky islets, rising out of a deep sea; or in\r\nthe case of the Channel, on the opposite coast of France, where the\r\ncoast makes a sudden descent, forming steep cliffs and leaving an open\r\nsea. The coast is said to be flat when it consists of soft argillaceous\r\nsoil descending to the shore with a gentle slope. Of this description of\r\ncoast there are two, namely, sandy beaches, and hillocks or dunes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat is the average depth of the sea? It is difficult to give an exact\r\nanswer to this question, because of the great difficulty met with in\r\ntaking soundings, caused chiefly by the deviations of submarine\r\ncurrents. No reliable soundings have yet been made in water over five\r\nmiles in depth.\r\n\r\nLaplace found, on astronomical consideration, that the mean depth of the\r\nocean could not be more than ten thousand feet. Alexander von Humboldt\r\nadopts the same figures. Dr. Young attributes to the Atlantic a mean\r\ndepth of a thousand yards, and to the Pacific, four thousand. Mr. Airy,\r\nthe Astronomer Royal, has laid down a formula, that waves of a given\r\nbreadth will travel with certain velocities at a given depth, from which\r\nit is estimated that the average depth of the North Pacific, between\r\nJapan and California, is two thousand one hundred and forty-nine\r\nfathoms, or two miles and a half. But these estimates fall far short of\r\nthe soundings reported by navigators, in which, as we shall see, there\r\nare important and only recently discovered elements of error. Du Petit\r\nThouars, during his scientific voyage in the frigate _Venus_, took some\r\nvery remarkable soundings in the Southern Pacific Ocean: one, without\r\nfinding bottom at two thousand four hundred and eleven fathoms; another,\r\nin the equinoctial region, indicated bottom at three thousand seven\r\nhundred and ninety.\r\n\r\nIn his last expedition, in search of a north-west passage, Captain Ross\r\nfound soundings at five thousand fathoms. Lieutenant Walsh, of the\r\nAmerican Navy, reports a cast of the deep-sea lead, not far from the\r\nAmerican coast, at thirty-four thousand feet without bottom. Lieutenant\r\nBerryman reported another unsuccessful attempt to fathom mid ocean with\r\na line thirty-nine thousand feet in length. Captain Denman, of H. M. S.\r\nHerald, reported bottom in the South Atlantic at the depth of forty-six\r\nthousand feet; and Lieutenant J. P. Parker, of the United States frigate\r\n_Congress_, on attempting soundings near the same region, let go his\r\nplummet, after it had run out a line fifty thousand feet long, as if the\r\nbottom had not been reached. We have the authority of Lieutenant Maury\r\nfor saying, however, that \"there are no such depths as these.\" The\r\nunder-currents of the deep sea have power to take the line out long\r\nafter the plummet has ceased to sink, and it was before this fact was\r\ndiscovered that these great soundings were reported. It has also been\r\ndiscovered that the line, once dragged down into the depths of the\r\nocean, runs out unceasingly. This difficulty was finally overcome by the\r\ningenuity of Midshipman Brooke. Under the judicious patronage of the\r\nSecretary to the United States Navy, Mr. Brooke invented the simple and\r\ningenious apparatus (Fig. 1), by which soundings are now made, in a\r\nmanner which not only establishes the depth, but brings up specimens of\r\nthe bottom. The sounding-line in this apparatus is attached to a weighty\r\nrod of iron, the lower extremity of which contains a hollow cup for the\r\nreception of tallow or some other soft substance. This rod is passed\r\nthrough a hole in a thirty-two pound spherical shot, being supported in\r\nits position by slings A, which are hooked on to the line by the swivels\r\n_a_. When the rod strikes the bottom, the tension on the line ceases,\r\nthe swivels are reversed, the slings B are thrown out of the hooks, the\r\nball falls to the ground, and the rod, released from its weight, is\r\neasily drawn up, bringing with it portions of the bottom attached to the\r\ngreasy substance in the cup. By means of this apparatus, specimens of\r\nthe bottom have been brought up from the depth of four miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Brooke's Sounding Apparatus.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest depth at which the bottom has been reached with this\r\nplummet is in the North Atlantic between the parallels of thirty-five\r\nand forty degrees north, and immediately south of the great bank of\r\nrocks off Newfoundland. This does not appear to be more than twenty-five\r\nthousand feet deep. \"The basin of the Atlantic,\" says Maury, \"according\r\nto the deep-sea soundings in the accompanying diagram, is a long trough\r\nseparating the Old World from the New, and extending, probably, from\r\npole to pole. In breadth, it contrasts strongly with the Pacific Ocean.\r\nFrom the top of Chimborazo to the bottom of the Atlantic, at the deepest\r\nplace yet reached by the plummet in that ocean, the distance in a\r\nvertical line is nine miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could the waters of the Atlantic be drawn off, so as to expose to view\r\nthis great sea gash which separates continents, and extends from the\r\nArctic to the Antarctic Seas, it would present a scene the most rugged,\r\ngrand, and imposing; the very ribs of the solid earth with the\r\nfoundations of the sea would be brought to light, and we should have\r\npresented to us in one view, in the empty cradle of the ocean, 'a\r\nthousand fearful wrecks,' with the array of 'dead men's skulls, great\r\nanchors, heaps of pearls, and inestimable stones,' which, in the poet's\r\neye, lie scattered on the bottom of the sea, making it hideous with the\r\nsight of ugly death.\"\r\n\r\nThe depth of the Mediterranean is comparatively inconsiderable. Between\r\nGibraltar and Ceuta, Captain Smith estimates the depth at about five\r\nthousand seven hundred feet, and from one to three thousand in the\r\nnarrower parts of the straits. Near Nice, Saussure found bottom at three\r\nthousand two hundred and fifty. It is said that the bottom is shallower\r\nin the Adriatic, and does not exceed a hundred and forty feet between\r\nthe coast of Dalmatia and the mouths of the Po.\r\n\r\nThe Baltic Sea is remarkable for its shallow waters, its maximum rarely\r\nexceeding six hundred feet.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the sea has similar inequalities to those observed\r\non land; it has its mountains, valleys, hills, and plains.\r\n\r\nThe Deep-sea Sounding Apparatus of Lieutenant Brooke has already\r\nfurnished some very remarkable results. Aided by it, Dr. Maury has\r\nconstructed his fine orographic map of the basin of the Atlantic, which\r\nis probably as exact as the maps which represent Africa or Australia.\r\nDr. Maury has also published many charts, giving the depths of the\r\nocean, the substance of which is given in the accompanying map, which\r\nrepresents the configuration of the Atlantic up to the tenth degree of\r\nsouth latitude, not in figures, as in Dr. Maury's charts, but in tints;\r\ndiagonal lines from right to left, representing the shores of both\r\nhemispheres, indicate a depth of less than a thousand fathoms; from left\r\nto right, indicate bottom at one thousand to two thousand; horizontal\r\nlines, two to three thousand fathoms; cross lines show an average depth\r\nof three to four thousand fathoms; finally, the perpendicular lines\r\nindicate a depth of four thousand fathoms and upwards. Solid black\r\nindicates continents and islands; waving lines, surrounding both\r\ncontinents at a short distance from the shore, indicate the sands which\r\nsurround the coast line at a little distance from the shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Chart of the Atlantic Ocean.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question may be asked, what useful purpose is served by taking\r\nsoundings at great depths? To this we may quote the answer of Franklin\r\nto a question of similar tendency, addressed to aeronauts--\"What purpose\r\nis served by the birth of a child?\" Every fact in physics is interesting\r\nin itself; it forms a rallying point, round which, sooner or later,\r\nothers will meet, in order to establish some useful truth; and the\r\nimportance of making and recording deep-sea soundings is established by\r\nthe successful immersion of the transatlantic telegraph.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the Atlantic there exists a remarkable plateau,\r\nextending from Cape Race in Newfoundland, to Cape Clear in Ireland, a\r\ndistance of over two thousand miles, with a breadth of four hundred and\r\nseventy miles: its mean depth along the whole route is estimated at two\r\nmiles to two miles and a half. It is upon this telegraphic plateau, as\r\nit has been called, that the attempt was made to lay down the cable in\r\n1858, and it is on it that the enterprise has been so successfully\r\ncompleted, during the year 1866. Tubular annelids, capable of boring\r\ninto all organic substances, are native to this plateau, and have\r\nmaterially assisted in destroying the electric cable. The surface of the\r\nplateau had been previously explored by means of Brooke's apparatus, and\r\nthe bottom was found to be composed chiefly of microscopic calcareous\r\nshells (_Foraminifera_), and a few siliceous shells (_Diatomaceæ_).\r\nThese delicate and fragile shells, which seemed to strew the bottom of\r\nthe sea, in beds of great thickness, were brought up by the sounding-rod\r\nin a state of perfect preservation, which proves that the water is\r\nremarkably quiet in these depths,--an inference which is fully borne out\r\nby the condition in which the cable of 1858 was found, when picked up in\r\n1866.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Section of the Atlantic, showing its depth and\r\nthe position of the Atlantic Telegraph.]\r\n\r\nThe first exploration of this plateau was undertaken by the American\r\nbrig _Dolphin_, which took a hundred soundings one hundred miles from\r\nthe coast of Scotland, afterwards taking the direction of the Azores, to\r\nthe north of which bottom was found, consisting of chalk and yellow\r\nsand, at nine thousand six hundred feet. To the south of Newfoundland,\r\nthe depth was found to be sixteen thousand five hundred feet. In 1856,\r\nLieutenant Berryman, of the American steamer _Arctic_, completed a line\r\nof soundings from St. John, Newfoundland, to Valentia, off the Irish\r\ncoast, and in 1857, Lieutenant Dayman, of the English steamship\r\n_Cyclops_, repeated the same operation: this last line of soundings,\r\nthe result of which is represented in the accompanying section, differed\r\nslightly from that followed by Lieutenant Berryman.\r\n\r\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, the depth does not seem to exceed seven thousand\r\nfeet; the Baltic does not in any place exceed eleven hundred. The depth\r\nof the Mediterranean is, as we have said, very variable. At Nice,\r\naccording to Horace de Saussure, the average depth is three thousand\r\nthree hundred feet. Between the Dalmatian coast and the mouth of the Po,\r\nbottom is found at a hundred and forty feet. Captain Smith found\r\nsoundings at from one thousand to nine thousand feet in the Straits of\r\nGibraltar, and at ten thousand feet between Gibraltar and Ceuta, where\r\nthe breadth exceeds sixteen miles. Between Rhodes and Alexandria, the\r\ngreatest depth is ten thousand feet. Between Alexandria and Candia it is\r\nten thousand three hundred. A hundred and twenty miles east of Malta it\r\nis fifteen thousand. The peculiar form of the Mediterranean has led to\r\nits being compared to a vast inverted tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Ocean has, probably, no great depth. Hence salt water,\r\nfollowing the general law of contracting as it is cooled until it\r\nfreezes, no ice can be formed on its surface till the temperature has\r\nfallen through its entire depth nearly to freezing point, when the\r\nentire mass is consolidated into pack-ice. According to Baron Wrangel,\r\nthe bottom of the glacial sea, on the north coast of Siberia, forms a\r\ngentle slope, and, at the distance of two hundred miles from the shore,\r\nit is still only from ninety to a hundred feet. Nevertheless, in\r\nBaffin's Bay, Dr. Kane made soundings at eleven thousand six hundred\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe inequalities of the basin of the Pacific Ocean are, comparatively,\r\nunknown to us. The greatest depth observed by Lieutenant Brooke in the\r\ngreat ocean is two thousand seven hundred fathoms, which he found in\r\nfifty-nine degrees north latitude and one hundred and sixty-six degrees\r\neast longitude. Applying the theory of waves to the billows propelled\r\nfrom the coast of Japan to California, during the earthquake of the 23rd\r\nof December, 1854, Professor Bache calculated that the mean depth of\r\nthis part of the Pacific is fourteen thousand four hundred feet. In the\r\nPacific Ocean, latitude sixty degrees south and one hundred and sixty\r\ndegrees east longitude, he found soundings at fourteen thousand six\r\nhundred feet--about two miles and a half. Another cast of the lead in\r\nthe Indian Ocean was made in seven thousand and forty fathoms, but\r\nwithout bringing up any soil from the bottom. Among the fragments\r\nbrought up from the bottom of the Coral Sea, a remarkable absence of\r\ncalcareous shells was noted, whilst the siliceous fragments of sponges\r\nwere found in great quantities. Other soundings made in the Pacific, at\r\na depth of four or five miles, were examined by Ehrenberg, who found a\r\nhundred and thirty-five different forms of infusoria represented, and\r\namong them twenty-two species new to him. Generally speaking, the\r\ncomposition of the infusoria of the Atlantic are calcareous; those of\r\nthe Pacific, siliceous. These animalcules draw from the sea the mineral\r\nmatter with which it is charged--that is, the lime or silica which form\r\ntheir shell. These shells accumulate after the death of the animal, and\r\nform the bottom of the ocean. The animals construct their habitations\r\nnear the surface; when they die, they fall into the depths of the ocean,\r\nwhere they accumulate in myriads, forming mountains and plains in mid\r\nocean. In this manner, we may remark, _en passant_, many of the existing\r\ncontinents had their birth in geological times. The horizontal beds of\r\nmarine deposits, which are called _sedimentary rocks_, and especially\r\nthe cretaceous rocks and calcareous beds of the Jurassic and Tertiary\r\nperiods, all result from such remains.[1]\r\n\r\nThe sea level is, in general, the same everywhere. It represents the\r\nspherical form of our planet, and is the basis for calculating all\r\nterrestrial heights; but many gulfs and inland seas open on the east are\r\nsupposed to be exceptions to this rule: the accumulation of waters,\r\npressed into these receptacles by the general movement of the sea from\r\neast to west, it is alleged, may pile up the waters, in some cases, to a\r\ngreater height than the general level.\r\n\r\nIt had long been admitted, on the faith of inexact observation, that the\r\nlevel of the Red Sea was higher than that of the Mediterranean. It has\r\nalso been said that the level of the Pacific Ocean at Panama is higher\r\nby about forty inches than the mean level of the Atlantic at Chagres,\r\nand that, at the moment of high water, this difference is increased to\r\nabout thirteen feet, while at low it is over six feet in the opposite\r\ndirection. This has been proved, so far as the evidence goes, to be\r\nerror in what concerns the difference in level of the Red Sea and\r\nMediterranean; and the opening of the Suez Canal, which is near at hand,\r\nwill probably furnish still more convincing proofs. Recent soundings\r\nshow that the mean level of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans are\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that all the waters of the several seas gathered\r\ntogether would form a sphere of fifty or sixty leagues in diameter, and,\r\nsupposing the surface of the globe perfectly level, that these waters\r\nwould submerge it to the depth of more than six hundred feet. Again,\r\nadmitting the mean depth of the sea to be thirteen thousand feet, its\r\nestimated contents ought to be nearly two thousand two hundred and fifty\r\nmillions of cubic miles of water; and, if the sea could be imagined to\r\nbe dried up, all the sewers of the earth would require to pour their\r\nwaters into it for forty thousand years, in order to fill the vast\r\nbasins anew.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we could imagine the entire globe to be divided into one thousand\r\nseven hundred and eighty-six parts by weight, we should find\r\napproximately, according to Sir John Herschel, that the total weight of\r\nthe oceanic waters is equivalent to one of these parts.\r\n\r\nThe specific weight of sea water is a little above that of fresh water,\r\nthe proportion being as a thousand to a thousand and twenty-seven. The\r\nDead Sea, which receives no fresh water into its bosom to maintain\r\nitself at the same level as other seas, acquires a higher degree of\r\nsaltness, and is equal to a thousand and twenty-eight. The specific\r\ngravity of sea water is about the same as the milk of a healthy woman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe colour of the sea is continually varying, and is chiefly caused by\r\nfiltration of the solar rays. According to the testimony of the majority\r\nof observers, the ocean, seen by reflection, presents a fine azure blue\r\nor ultramarine (_cæruleum mare_). When the air is pure and the surface\r\ncalm this tint softens insensibly, until it is lost and blended with the\r\nblue of the heavens. Near the shore it becomes more of a green or\r\nglaucus, and more or less brilliant, according to circumstances. There\r\nare some days when the ocean assumes a livid aspect, and others when it\r\nbecomes a very pure green; at other times, the green is sombre and sad.\r\nWhen the sea is agitated, the green takes a brownish hue. At sunset, the\r\nsurface of the sea is illumined with tints of every hue of purple and\r\nemerald. Placed in a vase, sea water appears perfectly transparent and\r\ncolourless. According to Scoresby, the Polar seas are of brilliant\r\nultramarine blue. Castaz says of the Mediterranean, that it is celestial\r\nblue, and Tuckey describes the equinoctial Atlantic as being of a vivid\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nMany local causes influence the colours of marine waters, and give them\r\ncertain decided and constant shades. A bottom of white sand will\r\ncommunicate a greyish or apple-green colour to the water, if not very\r\ndeep; when the sand is yellow, the green appears more sombre; the\r\npresence of rocks is often announced by the deep colour which the sea\r\ntakes in their vicinity. In the Bay of Loango the waters appear of a\r\ndeep red, because the bottom is there naturally red. It appears white in\r\nthe Gulf of Guinea, yellow on the coast of Japan, green to the west of\r\nthe Canaries, and black round the Maldive group of islands. The\r\nMediterranean, towards the Archipelago, sometimes becomes more or less\r\nred. The White and Black Seas appear to be named after the ice of the\r\none and the tempests to which the other is subject.\r\n\r\nAt other times, coloured animalcules give to the water a particular\r\ntint. The Red Sea owes its colour to a delicate microscopic algæ\r\n(_Trychodesmium erythræum_), which was subjected to the microscope by\r\nEhrenberg; but other causes of colouration are suggested. Some\r\nmicroscopists maintain that it is imparted by the shells and other\r\nremains of infusoria; others ascribe the colour to the evaporation which\r\ngoes on unceasingly in that riverless district, producing salt rocks on\r\na great scale all round its shores. In the same manner sea water,\r\nconcentrated by the action of the solar rays in the salt marshes of the\r\nsouth of France, when they arrive at a certain stage of concentration\r\ntake a fine red colour, which is due to the presence of some red-shelled\r\nanimalcules which only appear in sea water of this strength. The saline\r\nlakes on the Great Thibetian water sheds are due to this cause.\r\nStrangely enough, these minute creatures die when the waters attain\r\ngreater density by further concentration, and also if it becomes weaker\r\nfrom the effects of rain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNavigators often traverse long patches of green, red, white, or yellow\r\ncoloured water, all of which are due to the presence of microscopic\r\ncrustaceans, medusæ, zoophytes, and marine plants; the Vermilion Sea on\r\nthe Californian coast is entirely due to the latter cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon known as _Phosphorescence of the Sea_ is due to analogous\r\ncauses. This wonderful sight is observable in all seas, but is most\r\nfrequent in the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Gulf, and other tropical seas.\r\nIn the Indian Ocean, Captain Kingman, of the American ship _Shooting\r\nStar_, traversed a zone twenty-three miles in length so filled with\r\nphosphorescent animalcules that at seven hours forty-five minutes the\r\nwater was rapidly assuming a white, milky appearance, and during the\r\nnight it presented the appearance of a vast field of snow. \"There was\r\nscarcely a cloud in the heavens,\" he continues, \"yet the sky, for about\r\nten degrees above the horizon, appeared as black as if a storm were\r\nraging; stars of the first magnitude shone with a feeble light, and the\r\n'Milky Way' of the heavens was almost entirely eclipsed by that through\r\nwhich we were sailing.\" The animals which produced this appearance were\r\nabout six inches long, and formed of a gelatinous and translucent\r\nmatter. At times, the sea was one blaze of light, produced by countless\r\nmillions of minute globular creatures, called _Noctilucæ_. The motion of\r\na vessel or the plash of an oar will often excite their lucidity, and\r\nsometimes, after the ebb of tide, the rocks and seaweed of the coast are\r\nglowing with them. Various other tribes of animals there are which\r\ncontribute to this luminous appearance of the sea. M. Peron thus\r\ndescribes the effect produced by _Pyrosoma Atlanticum_, on his voyage to\r\nthe Isle of France: \"The wind was blowing with great violence, the night\r\nwas dark, and the vessel was making rapid way, when what appeared to be\r\na vast sheet of phosphorus presented itself floating on the waves, and\r\noccupying a great space ahead of the ship. The vessel having passed\r\nthrough this fiery mass, it was discovered that the light was occasioned\r\nby animalcules swimming about in the sea at various depths round the\r\nship. Those which were deepest in the water looked like red-hot balls,\r\nwhile those on the surface resembled cylinders of red-hot iron. Some of\r\nthe latter were caught: they were found to vary in size from three to\r\nseven inches. All the exterior of the creatures bristled with long thick\r\ntubercles, shining like so many diamonds, and these seemed to be the\r\nprincipal seat of their luminosity. Inside also there appeared to be a\r\nmultitude of oblong narrow glands, exhibiting a high degree of\r\nphosphoric power. The colour of these animals when in repose is an opal\r\nyellow, mixed with green; but, on the slightest movement, the animal\r\nexhibits a spontaneous contractile power, and assumes a luminous\r\nbrilliancy, passing through various shades of deep red, orange, green,\r\nand azure blue.\"\r\n\r\nThe phosphorescence of the sea is a spectacle at once imposing and\r\nmagnificent. The ship, in plunging through the waves, seems to advance\r\nthrough a sea of red and blue flame, which is thrown off by the keel\r\nlike so much lightning. Myriads of creatures float and play on the\r\nsurface of the waves, dividing, multiplying, and reuniting, so as to\r\nform one vast field of fire. In stormy weather the luminous waves roll\r\nand break in a silvery foam. Glittering bodies, which might be taken for\r\nfire-fishes, seem to pursue and catch each other--lose their hold, and\r\ndart after each other anew. From time immemorial, the phosphorescence of\r\nthe sea has been observed by navigators. The luminous appearance\r\npresents itself on the crest of the waves, which in falling scatters it\r\nin all directions. It attaches itself to the rudder and dashes against\r\nthe bows of the vessel. It plays round the reefs and rocks against which\r\nthe waves beat, and on silent nights, in the tropics, its effects are\r\ntruly magical. This phosphorescence is due chiefly to the presence of a\r\nmultitude of mollusks and zoophytes which seem to shine by their own\r\nlight; they emit a fluid so susceptible of expansion, that in the zigzag\r\nmovement pursued they leave a luminous train upon the water, which\r\nspreads with immense rapidity. One of the most remarkable of these\r\nminute mollusks is a species of _Pyrosoma_, a sort of mucous sac of an\r\ninch long, which, thrown upon the deck of a ship, emits a light like a\r\nrod of iron heated to a white heat. Sir John Herschel noted on the\r\nsurface of calm water a very curious form of this phosphorescence; it\r\nwas a polygon of rectilinear shape, covering many square feet of\r\nsurface, and it illuminated the whole region for some moments with a\r\nvivid light, which traversed it with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe phosphorescence of the sea may also result from another cause. When\r\nanimal matter is decomposed, it becomes phosphorescent. The bodies of\r\ncertain fishes, when they become a prey to putrefaction, emit an intense\r\nlight. MM. Becquerel and Breschet have noted fine phosphorescent effects\r\nfrom this cause in the waters of the Brenta at Venice. Animal matter in\r\na state of decomposition, proceeding from dead fish which floats on the\r\nsurface of ponds, is capable of producing large patches of oleaginous\r\nmatter, which, piled upon the water, communicates to a considerable\r\nextent the phosphorescent aspect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the case elsewhere, there are local causes which affect\r\nthe colour of the waters in certain rivers, and even originate their\r\nnames. The Guaïnia, which with the Casiquaire forms the Rio Negro, is of\r\na deep brown, which scarcely interferes with the limpidity of its\r\nwaters. The waters of the Orinoco and the Casiquaire have also a\r\nbrownish colour. The Ganges is of a muddy brown, while the Djumna, which\r\nit receives, is green or blue. The whitish colour belongs to the Rio\r\nBianco, or White River, and to many other rivers. The Ohio in America,\r\nthe Torgedale, the Goetha, the Traun at Ischl, and most of the Norwegian\r\nrivers, are of a delicate limpid green. The Yellow River and the Blue\r\nRiver in China are distinguished by the characteristic tint of their\r\nwaters. The Arkansas, the Red River, and the Lobregat in Catalonia, are\r\nremarkable for their red colour, which, like the Dart and other English\r\nrivers, they owe to the earth over which they flow, or which their\r\nwaters hold in suspension.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe water of the sea is essentially _salt_, of a peculiar flavour,\r\nslightly acrid and bitter, and a little nauseous. It has an odour\r\nperfectly _sui generis_, and is slightly viscous. In short, it includes\r\na great number of mineral salts and some other compounds, which give it\r\na very disagreeable taste, and render it unfit for domestic use. It\r\ncontains nearly all the soluble substances which exist on the globe, but\r\nprincipally chloride of sodium, or marine salt, and sulphate of\r\nmagnesia, of potassium, and of lime.\r\n\r\nPure water is produced by a combination of one volume of oxygen and of\r\ntwo volumes of hydrogen, or in weight, 100 oxygen and 12·50 hydrogen.\r\nSea water is composed of the same; but we find there, besides, other\r\nelements, the presence of which chemistry reveals to us. In 1000 grains\r\nof sea water the following ingredients are found:--\r\n\r\n    Water                             962·0\r\n    Chloride of sodium                 27·1\r\n    Chloride of magnesium               5·4\r\n    Chloride of potassium               0·4\r\n    Bromide of magnesia                 0·1\r\n    Sulphate of magnesia                1·2\r\n    Sulphate of lime                    0·8\r\n    Carbonate of lime                   0·1\r\n              Leaving a residuum of     2·9\r\n                                      -----\r\n                                       1000\r\n                                      =====\r\n\r\nconsisting of sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrochlorate of ammonia, iodine\r\niron, copper, and even silver in various quantities and proportions,\r\naccording to the locality of the specimen. In examining the plates of\r\ncopper taken from the bottom of a ship at Valparaiso, which had been\r\nlong at sea, distinct traces of silver were found deposited by the sea.\r\nFinally, we find dissolved in the ocean a peculiar mucus, which seems of\r\na mixed animal and vegetable nature, and is evidently organic matter\r\nproceeding from the successive decomposition of the innumerable\r\ngenerations of animals which have disappeared since the beginning of the\r\nworld. This matter has been described by the Count Marsigli, who\r\ndesignates it sometimes under the name of _glu_, and sometimes as an\r\n_unctuosity_. It is the \"ooze\" of marine surveyors, and consists chiefly\r\nof carbonate of lime, ninety per cent. of which is formed of minute\r\nanimal organisms. Its mealy adhesiveness results from the pressure of\r\nthe superimposed water. The numerous salts which exist in the sea can\r\nneither be deposited in its bed, nor exhaled with the vapour, to be\r\nagain poured upon the soil in showers of rain. Particular agents retain\r\nthese salts in solution, transform them, and prevent their accumulation.\r\nHence sea water always maintains a certain degree of saltness and\r\nbitterness, and the ocean continues to present the chemical characters\r\nwhich it has exhibited in all times, varying only in certain localities\r\nwhere more or less fresh water is poured into the sea basin from rivers:\r\nthus the saltness of the Mediterranean is greater than that of the\r\nocean, probably because it loses more water by evaporation than it\r\nreceives from its fresh-water affluents. For the opposite reason, the\r\nBlack and the Caspian Seas are less charged with these salts. The Dead\r\nSea is so strongly impregnated with salt that the body of a man floats\r\non its surface without sinking, like a piece of cork upon fresh water.\r\nThe supposed cause is excessive evaporation and the absence of rivers of\r\nany importance.\r\n\r\nThe saltness of the sea seems to be generally less towards the poles\r\nthan the equator; but there are exceptions to this law. In the Irish\r\nChannel, near the Cumberland coast, the water contains salt equal to the\r\nfortieth of its weight; on the coast of France, it is equal to one\r\nthirty-second; in the Baltic, it is equal to a thirtieth; at Teneriffe,\r\na twenty-eighth; and off the coast of Spain, to a sixteenth. Again, in\r\nmany places the sea is less salt at the surface than at the bottom. In\r\nthe Straits of the Dardanelles, at Constantinople, the proportion is as\r\nseventy-two to sixty-two. In the Mediterranean, it is as thirty-two to\r\ntwenty-nine. It is also stated that as the salt increases at a certain\r\ndepth, the water becomes less bitter. At the mouth of the great rivers\r\nit is scarcely necessary to add that the water is always less saline\r\nthan on shores which receive no supplies of fresh water; the same remark\r\napplies to sea water in the vicinity of polar ice, the melting of which\r\nis productive of much fresh water. A recent analysis of the water of the\r\nDead Sea by M. Roux gives about two pounds of salt to one gallon of\r\nwater. No mineral water, if we except that of the Salt Lake of Utah, is\r\nso largely impregnated with saline substances; the quantity of bromide\r\nof magnesia is 0·35 grammes to the litre. The water of the Dead Sea is,\r\naccording to these proportions, the richest natural depository of\r\nbromide, which it might be made to furnish abundantly. The waters of the\r\ngreat Lake of Utah and Lake Ourmiah in Persia are both highly saline. In\r\nLake Ourmiah, as in the Dead Sea, the proportion of salt is six times\r\ngreater than in the ocean. Many of our fresh-water lakes were probably\r\nsalt originally, but have by degrees lost their saline properties by the\r\nmingling of their waters with those of the rivers which traverse or flow\r\ninto them. Among the lakes which appear to have been divested of their\r\nsaline properties may be mentioned the great lakes of Canada and the Sea\r\nof Baikal, in all of which seals and other marine animals are still\r\nfound, which have become acclimatized as the water gradually became\r\nfresh.\r\n\r\nThe saltness of sea water increases its density, and at the same time\r\nits buoyancy, thus adapting it for bearing ships and other burdens on\r\nits bosom; moreover, to abbreviate slightly Dr. Maury's remark, \"the\r\nbrine of the ocean is the ley of the earth.\" From it the sea derives\r\ndynamical power, and its currents their main strength. It is the salt of\r\nthe sea that imparts to its waters those curious anomalies in the laws\r\nof freezing and of thermal dilatation, that assist the rays of heat to\r\npenetrate its bosom; the salts of the sea invest it with adaptations\r\nwhich fresh water could not possess. In the latter case, the maximum\r\ndensity would be thirty-nine degrees two seconds F. instead of\r\ntwenty-seven degrees two seconds F., when the dynamical force of the sea\r\nwould be insufficient to put the Gulf Stream in motion. Nor could it\r\nregulate those climates we call marine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have said that sea water contains nearly all the soluble substances\r\nwhich exist in the globe. Nevertheless its exhalation is comparatively\r\npure. \"The water which evaporates from the sea,\" says Youman, in his\r\n\"Chemistry,\" \"is nearly pure, containing but very minute traces of\r\nsalts. Falling as rain upon the land, it washes the soil, percolates\r\nthrough the rocky layers, and becomes charged with saline substances,\r\nwhich are borne seaward by the returning currents. The ocean, therefore,\r\nis the great depository of all substances that water can dissolve and\r\ncarry down from the surface of the continents; and, as there is no\r\nchannel for their escape, they would constantly accumulate, were it not\r\nfor the creatures which inhabit the seas, and utilize the material thus\r\nbrought within their reach.\" These substances are chloride of sodium or\r\nmarine salt, sulphates of magnesia, potassa, lime, and other substances\r\nwhich the water of various seas is found to contain.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1847, I made an analysis of water taken a few leagues from\r\nthe coast at Havre, which gave the following result, from one litre (1\r\npint·760773):--[2]\r\n\r\n                                                         Grammes.\r\n    Chloride of sodium                                    25·704\r\n    Chloride of magnesium                                  2·905\r\n    Sulphate of magnesia                                   2·462\r\n    Sulphate of lime                                       1·210\r\n    Sulphate of potassa                                    0·094\r\n    Carbonate of lime                                      0·132\r\n    Silicate of soda                                       0·017\r\n    Bromide of sodium                                      0·103\r\n    Bromide of magnesium                                   0·030\r\n    Oxide of iron, carbonate and phosphate of magnesia,}   Only\r\n      and oxide of manganese                           }   traces.\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          32·657\r\n                                                          ======\r\n\r\nThe water of the Mediterranean contains more salts than that of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nThe following are, according to M. Usiglio, who was one of a commission\r\nsent to examine the different kinds of salt water in the south of\r\nFrance, the component parts of one hundred gallons of Mediterranean\r\nwater:--\r\n\r\n                                     lbs.\r\n    Chloride of sodium            29·524\r\n    Chloride of potassium          0·405\r\n    Chloride of magnesium          3·219\r\n    Sulphate of magnesia           2·477\r\n    Chloride of calcium            6·080\r\n    Sulphate of lime               1·557\r\n    Carbonate of lime              0·114\r\n    Bromide of sodium              0·356\r\n    Protoxide of iron              0·003\r\n                                  ------\r\n                    Total         43·735\r\n                                  ======\r\n\r\nWe conclude, from the quantity of sea salt contained in the water of the\r\nocean, that, if it were spread over the surface of the globe, it would\r\nform a layer of more than thirty feet in height.\r\n\r\nThe salt contained in sea water gives it a greater density than fresh\r\nwater; its average specific weight is 1.027. The density of the water of\r\nthe Mediterranean is, according to M. Usiglio, 1.025 when at the\r\ntemperature of seventy degrees. But the saltness of the sea varies very\r\nmuch under the influence of a great many local circumstances, among\r\nwhich we must count principally currents, winds favourable to\r\nevaporation, rivers coming from the continents, &c.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the sea is less salt towards the poles than at\r\nthe equator; that the saltness increases, in general, with the distance\r\nfrom land, and the depth of the water; that the interior seas, such as\r\nthe Baltic, the Black Sea, the White Sea, the Sea of Marmora, and the\r\nYellow Sea, are less salt than the ocean. The Mediterranean is an\r\nexception to this last rule; it is, as we have seen, salter than the\r\nocean. This difference is explained by the fact that the quantity of\r\nfresh water brought into it by rivers is less than that lost by\r\nevaporation. The Mediterranean must therefore grow salter with time,\r\nunless its water is discharged into the ocean by a counter current,\r\nwhich would run under the current coming from the Atlantic by the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe Black Sea, on the contrary, the water of which has a density of only\r\n1.013, receives from rivers more fresh water than it loses by\r\nevaporation. The saltness of this interior sea is only half as intense\r\nas that of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea are still less salt than the Black\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the relative composition of the water in these\r\nthree interior seas:--\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n  |                          |  Black Sea.  | Sea of Azov. | Caspian Sea. |\r\n  | In 100 Gallons of Water. |   Density    |   Density    |   Density    |\r\n  |                          |    1·013     |    1·009.    |    1·005.    |\r\n  +--------------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n  | Chloride of sodium       |   14·0195    |    9·6583    |    3·6731    |\r\n  | Chloride of potassium    |    9·1892    |    0·1279    |    0·0761    |\r\n  | Chloride of magnesium    |    1·3045    |    0·8870    |    0·6324    |\r\n  | Sulphate of magnesia     |    1·4704    |    0·7642    |    1·2389    |\r\n  | Sulphate of lime         |    0·1047    |    0·2879    |    0·4903    |\r\n  | Bicarbonate of magnesia  |    0·2086    |    0·1286    |    0·0129    |\r\n  | Bicarbonate of lime      |    0·3646    |    0·0221    |    0·1705    |\r\n  | Bromide of magnesium     |    0·0052    |    0·0035    |    traces    |\r\n  |                          +--------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n  |                          |   17·6663    |   11·8795    |    6·2942    |\r\n  +--------------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nIn lakes without any outlet, as the Dead Sea and the Lake of Ural, the\r\ndegree of saltness is considerably augmented. Numerous experiments have\r\nproved that the water of the Dead Sea is six times salter than that of\r\nthe ocean. MM. Boutron and O'Henry analysed, in April, 1850, after the\r\nrainy season, some water of the Dead Sea, taken at about two leagues\r\nfrom the mouth of the Jordan; its density was then 1·10.\r\n\r\nThe saltness of sea water makes it more fitted to float ships, because\r\nits density is increased by the salts which are dissolved in it. Besides\r\nthis, these salts contribute to prevent the water becoming contaminated\r\nwith decomposed organic matter.\r\n\r\nBy the table representing the composition of the water of the ocean and\r\nof that of the Mediterranean, we see that salts of lime and potassium,\r\nas well as iodine and silica, are only found in infinitely small\r\nquantities. Nevertheless, the lime and silica contained in the sea water\r\nare of very great importance; for these quantities, which appear to us\r\nso small in the table of a chemical analysis, become enormous in the\r\nentire extent of the ocean. The marine plants take in the lime, the\r\nsilica, the potassa, and the iodides which are dissolved in the sea\r\nwater; these mineral substances enter into their textures. It is from\r\nthe carbonate of lime and silica that the marine animals form their\r\nsolid covering, their shell or carapace. The infusoria make use of the\r\nlime, silica, and potassa for the same purpose. It is by the life and\r\nhabits of the polypi that we explain those _Coral Islands_ found in the\r\nsea, the existence of which has been a subject of much astonishment,\r\nand ought, therefore, to find a place in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific and Indian Oceans are studded with islands in a state of\r\nformation, which owe their origin to the polypi and corallines. These\r\nzoophytes extract from the sea water the lime and silicium which are\r\nfound there in the state of soluble salts. In order to grow and develop,\r\nthey must be continually under water. They are constantly producing\r\ncalcareous deposits; these deposits rise rapidly, and at last reach the\r\nsurface of the water. Then the seaweed and rubbish of all kinds that the\r\nsea carries along with it, arrested by these emerged masses, cover them\r\nwith a layer of fertile soil; which is soon covered with vegetation, as\r\nthe birds and the waves bring seeds thither.\r\n\r\nThe Coral Islands of the Pacific, which are described in another\r\nchapter, are formed in this manner.\r\n\r\nBesides the substances named, sea water also contains, in\r\ninfinitesimally small quantities, metals, such as iron, copper, lead and\r\nsilver. The old copper collecting round the keels of ships sometimes so\r\nmuch silver that it has been thought worth extracting! A curious\r\ncalculation has been attempted, based on the age of ships and the\r\ndistance they have gone during all their voyages, to show that the sea\r\ncontains in solution two million tons of silver.[3]\r\n\r\nThe question has often been asked, whence comes the salt and other\r\nsubstances held in solution in sea water? If our readers will turn back\r\nto the first few pages of \"The World before the Deluge,\" they will\r\nbetter understand the very simple geological explanation that we are\r\ngoing to give of the origin of different substances dissolved in sea\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn the first stage of our planet, before the watery vapours contained in\r\nthe primitive atmosphere were condensed, and before they had begun to\r\nfall on the earth in the form of boiling rain, the shell of the earth\r\ncontained an infinite variety of heterogeneous mineral substances, some\r\nsoluble in water, others not. When rain fell on the burning surface for\r\nthe first time, the waters became charged with all the soluble\r\nsubstances, which were reunited and afterwards deposited, accumulating\r\nin the large depressions of the soil. The seas of the primitive globe\r\nwere thus formed of rain water, holding in solution all that the earth\r\nhad given up, collected in large basins. Chloride of sodium, sulphates\r\nof soda, magnesia, potassium, lime, and silica, in the form of soluble\r\nsilicate; in a word, every soluble matter that the primitive globe\r\ncontained formed part of the mineral contingent of this water. If we\r\nreflect that through all time up to the present day none of the general\r\nlaws of nature have changed--if we consider that the soluble substances\r\ncontained in the water of the primitive seas have remained there, and\r\nthat the fresh water of the rivers constantly replaces the water which\r\ndisappears by evaporation--we have the true explanation of the saltness\r\nof sea water. \"It is a very simple theory, it is true,\" adds M. Figuier,\r\n\"but one that we have found nowhere, and the responsibility of which we\r\ntherefore claim. The chloride of sodium is by no means the only\r\nsubstance dissolved in sea water. It contains, besides, many other\r\nmineral substances: in short, every _soluble salt_ on the face of the\r\nglobe, and, along with them, portions of different metals in infinitely\r\nsmall quantities.\"\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of the surface of the sea is nearly the same as the\r\natmosphere, so long as no currents of heat or cold interpose their\r\nperturbing influence. In the neighbourhood of the Tropics, it appears\r\nthat the surface of the water is slightly warmer than the ambient air,\r\nbut experiments on the temperature of the sea from the surface to the\r\nbottom reveal, according to our author,[4] \"some evidence which\r\nestablishes a curious law. In very deep water a perfectly uniform\r\ntemperature of four degrees below zero prevails, which corresponds, as\r\nphysics have established, to the maximum density of water. Under the\r\nEquator this temperature exists at the depth of seven thousand feet. In\r\nthe Polar regions, where water is colder at the surface, this\r\ntemperature is maintained at four thousand six hundred feet. The\r\nisothermal lines of four degrees form a line of demarcation between the\r\nZones, where the surface of the sea is colder, and those where it is\r\nwarmer than the bed of four degrees below zero.\" This is more clearly\r\nshown in Fig. 4, which represents a section of the ocean, the curved\r\nline which touches two points at the surface indicating the depths where\r\nthe temperature is constantly fixed at four degrees.\r\n\r\nDr. Maury's account of this phenomenon is asserted with less confidence.\r\nThe existence of an _isothermal floor_ of the ocean, as he calls it,\r\nwas first suggested by the observations of Kotzebue, Admiral Beechey,\r\nand Sir James C. Ross. \"Its temperature, according to Kotzebue, is\r\nthirty-six degrees Fahr., or four degrees Cent.; the depth of this bed,\r\nof invariable and uniform temperature, is twelve hundred fathoms at the\r\nEquator; thence it gradually rises to the parallel of about fifty-six\r\ndegrees north and south, when it crops out, and there the temperature of\r\nthe sea from top to bottom is conjectured to be permanent at thirty-six\r\ndegrees. The place of this outcrop, no doubt, shifts with the seasons,\r\nvibrating north and south, after the manner of the Calm belts.\r\nProceeding onwards to the Frigid zones, this aqueous stratum of an\r\nunchanging temperature dips again, and continues to incline till it\r\nreaches the Poles, at the depth of seven hundred and fifty fathoms; so\r\nthat on the equatorial side of the outcrop the water above the\r\nisothermal floor is the warmer, but in Polar seas the supernatant water\r\nis the colder.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 4. Thermal Lines of equal Temperature.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the saline properties of sea water Maury discovers one of the\r\nprincipal forces from which currents in the ocean proceed. \"The brine of\r\nthe ocean is the ley of the earth,\" he says; \"from it the sea derives\r\ndynamical powers, and its currents their main strength. Hence, to\r\nunderstand the dynamics of the ocean, it is necessary to study the\r\neffects of their saltness upon the equilibrium of the waves. Why is the\r\nsea made salt? It is the salts of the sea that impart to its waters\r\nthose curious anomalies in the laws of freezing and of thermal\r\ndilatation. It is the salts of the sea that assist the rays of heat to\r\npenetrate its bosom.\" The circulation of the ocean is indispensable to\r\nthe distribution of temperature--to the maintenance of the\r\nmeteorological and climatic conditions which rule the development of\r\nlife; and this circulation could not exist--at least, the character of\r\nits waters would be completely changed--if they were fresh in place of\r\nsalt. \"Let us imagine,\" says M. Julien, \"that the sea, now entirely\r\ncomposed of fresh water, of one uniform temperature from the Pole to the\r\nEquator, and from the surface to its greatest depths; the solar heat\r\nwould penetrate the liquid beds nearest to the Equator; it would dilate\r\nthem, so as to raise them above their primitive level; by the single\r\neffect of gravitation, they would glide on the surface towards the polar\r\nzones. The absence of all solar radiation would tend, on the contrary,\r\nto cool and contract them without this tendency. An exchange would be\r\nestablished from the extremities towards the centre; in other words, a\r\ncounter current of cold and heavy water, calculated to replace the\r\nlosses occasioned by the action of solar radiation, would descend from\r\nthe Poles, but quite maintaining itself beneath the light and warm\r\ncurrent from the Equator.\"\r\n\r\nIn a like system of general circulation, the physical properties of pure\r\nwater, which attains its maximum of density seven degrees two seconds F.\r\nbelow zero, would produce the most singular consequences. As its\r\ntemperature rose above that point, the water would become lighter,\r\nhaving, consequently, a tendency to ascend towards the upper beds. After\r\nthis, the equatorial current, meeting in its progress towards the Poles\r\nthe cold water, would itself be cooled down; and when its temperature\r\nhad reached four degrees below zero, being now heavier than the polar\r\ncurrent, would change places with it, descending until it reached water\r\nequally dense, while the polar current would ascend. Hence would arise a\r\nsort of confusion of currents which would give to a fresh-water ocean\r\nthe strangest results, disarranging every instant the regular\r\ncirculation of its waters. It could not be so, however, in an ocean of\r\nsalt water, which attains its maximum specific gravity at four degrees\r\neight seconds F. below zero. By evaporation at the surface it is\r\nconcentrated and precipitated, and thus rendered denser than that\r\nimmediately below the surface. It consequently sinks, while the lower\r\nbeds come up to replace, in order to modify it, and in turn to be\r\nprecipitated in the same manner. \"In this manner we find established a\r\ncontinually ascending and descending movement, which carries down into\r\nthe depths of ocean the water warmed at the surface by the solar rays of\r\nthe Torrid zone. This double vertical current facilitates and prepares\r\nthe grand horizontal current which puts these submarine reservoirs of\r\nheat in communication with the lower beds of the glacial sea. In the\r\nArctic basin the clouds, the melted snow, and the great rivers, which\r\nhave their mouths on the north of both continents, produce considerable\r\nquantities of fresh water, which, mixing with the waves of the Polar\r\nSea, form a bed of mean density light enough to maintain itself and flow\r\noff towards the Atlantic Ocean. These surface movements determine in the\r\nlower regions certain contrary movements, whence originate the powerful\r\ncounter currents which ascend the Straits from Baffin's Bay and reappear\r\nin the mysterious 'Polynia' of Kane, diffusing there its treasure of\r\nheat brought from intertropical seas.\" Dr. Kane, in his interesting\r\nNarrative, reports an open sea north of the parallel of eighty-two\r\ndegrees, which he and his party crossed a barrier of ice eighty miles\r\nbroad to reach, and before he reached it the thermometer marked sixty\r\ndegrees. Beyond this ice-bound region he found himself on the shores of\r\nan iceless sea, extending in an unbroken sheet of water as far as the\r\neye could reach towards the Pole. Its waves were dashing on the beach\r\nwith the swell of a great ocean; the tides ebbed and flowed. Now the\r\nquestion arises, Where did those tides have their origin? The tidal wave\r\nof the Atlantic could not have passed under the icy barrier which De\r\nHaven found so firm; therefore they must have been cradled in the cold\r\nsea round the Pole; in which case it follows that most, if not all, the\r\nunexplored regions about the Pole must be covered with deep water, the\r\nonly source of strong and regular tides. Seals were sporting and\r\nwaterfowl feeding in this open sea, as Dr. Kane tells us, and the\r\ntemperature of the water which rolled in and dashed at his feet with\r\nmeasured beat was thirty-six degrees, while the bottom of the icy\r\nbarrier of eighty miles was probably hundreds of feet below the surface\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\"The existence of these tides,\" says Maury, \"with the immense flow and\r\ndrift which annually take place from the Polar Seas and the Atlantic,\r\nsuggests many conjectures as to the condition of these unexplored\r\nregions. Whalemen have always been puzzled as to the breeding place of\r\nthe great whale. It is a cold-water animal, and, following up the train\r\nof thought, the question arises, Is not the nursery for the great whale\r\nin this Polar Sea, which is so set about and hemmed in by a hedge of\r\nice, that man may not trespass there?\"\r\n\r\nOne or two points worthy of notice may be recorded here. Shallow water,\r\nand water near the coast, or covering raised sand-banks, is colder than\r\nwater in the open sea. Alexander von Humboldt explains this phenomenon\r\nby supposing that deep waters of higher temperature reascend from the\r\nlowest depths and mingle with the upper beds. Fogs are frequently formed\r\nover sand-banks, because the cold water which covers them produces a\r\nlocal precipitation of atmospheric vapour. The contour of these fogs are\r\nperfectly defined when seen from a distance: they reproduce the form and\r\naccidents due to the submarine soil. Moreover, we often see clouds\r\narrested over these points, which look from afar like the peaks of\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"World before the Deluge.\" Second edition.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Examen Comparatif des Principales eaux Minérales Salines de\r\nFrance et d'Allemagne, par MM.

In proportion as it cools, water increases in density, and\r\ndescends into the depths until it reaches a constant temperature of four\r\ndegrees twenty-five minutes Cent. below zero, which it preserves in all\r\nlatitudes at the depth of a thousand yards, according to M. D'Urville.\r\n\r\nIf the water continues to cool, and reaches zero, it becomes lighter\r\nthan it was at four degrees twenty-five minutes Cent., and ascends in a\r\nstate of congelation--a process which, by an admirable provision of\r\nnature, can only take place at the surface. So long as the temperature\r\nis above four degrees twenty-five minutes, water is light, and ascends\r\nto the surface, while colder water sinks to the bottom. Below four\r\ndegrees twenty-five minutes the process is reversed; the first\r\nphenomenon is always in force under the Equator, the second near the\r\nPoles. The evaporation, which is in continual operation in warm seas,\r\nforming vast rain-clouds at the expense of the sea, is compensated by\r\nunceasing currents of colder water flowing from the Poles. This\r\nevaporation has a direct influence, moreover, on the density of sea\r\nwater, and is pointed out by Dr. Maury as a remarkable instance of the\r\ncompensations by which the oceanic waters are governed: \"According to\r\nRodgers' observations,\" he says, \"the average specific gravity of sea\r\nwater on the parallels of thirty-four degrees north and south, at a mean\r\ntemperature of sixty-four degrees, is just what it ought to be,\r\naccording to saline and thermal laws; but its specific gravity, when\r\ntaken from the Equator at a mean temperature of eighty-one degrees, is\r\nmuch greater than, according to the same laws, it ought to be--the\r\nobserved difference being ·0015, whereas it ought to be ·0025. Let us\r\ninquire,\" he adds, \"what makes the equatorial waters so much heavier\r\nthan they ought to be.\r\n\r\n\"The anomaly occurs in the trade-wind region, and is best developed\r\nbetween the parallel of forty degrees in the North Atlantic and the\r\nEquator, where the water grows warmer, but not proportionally lighter.\r\nThe water sucked up by the trade-winds is fresh water, and the salt it\r\ncontained, being left behind, is just sufficient to counteract by its\r\nweight the effect of thermal dilatation upon the specific gravity of\r\nwater between the parallels of thirty-four degrees north and south. The\r\nthirsting of the trade-winds for vapour is so balanced as to produce\r\nperfect compensation, and a more beautiful instance than we have here\r\nstumbled upon is not, it appears to me, to be found in the mechanism of\r\nthe universe.\"\r\n\r\nThe oceanic currents are due to a great number of causes: the duration\r\nand force of the winds, for instance; the rise and fall of tides all\r\nover the globe; the variations in the density of the waters, according\r\nto its temperature, and the evaporating powers of the atmosphere; the\r\ndepth and degree of saltness to which we have already alluded; finally,\r\nto the variations of barometric pressure.\r\n\r\nThe currents which furrow the ocean present a striking contrast with the\r\nimmobility of the neighbouring waters; they form rivers of a determinate\r\nbreadth, whose banks are formed by the water in repose, and whose course\r\nis often made quite perceptible by the vrachs and other aquatic plants\r\nwhich follow in their train.\r\n\r\nIn order to comprehend the origin of these _pelagic rivers_, it is\r\nnecessary to consider the laws which govern the atmospheric currents, in\r\nparticular the _trade-winds_. \"Hence,\" says Maury, \"in studying the\r\nsystem of oceanic circulation, we set out with the very simple\r\nassumption, that from whatever part of the ocean a current is found to\r\nrun, to that same part a current of equal volume is bound to return;\r\nfor on this principle is based the whole system of currents and counter\r\ncurrents.\" The differences of temperature between equinoctial and polar\r\ncountries generate two opposing currents, the upper one proceeding from\r\nthe Equator to the Poles, the lower one directed from the Poles towards\r\nthe Equator. On reaching the Equator, the cold current of air from the\r\nPoles is warmed and rarefied, and ascends to the upper beds of the\r\natmosphere, whence it is again led to its point of departure; there it\r\nis again cooled, and returns with the lower current towards the tropical\r\nregions. But the rotatory movement of the earth modifies the direction\r\nof these atmospheric currents. The movement by which it is carried from\r\nwest to east being almost nothing at the Poles, but inconceivably rapid\r\nunder the Equator, it follows that the cold air, in proportion as it\r\nadvances towards the Tropics, ought to incline a little towards the\r\nwest. This is just what takes place with these counter currents. The\r\n_north-east trade-winds_, which prevail in the northern hemisphere, move\r\nin a sort of spiral curve, turning to the west as they rush from the\r\nPoles to the Equator, and in the opposite direction as they move from\r\nthe Equator towards the Poles; the immediate cause of this motion being\r\nthe rotation of the earth on its axis. \"The earth,\" says Dr. Maury,\r\n\"moves from west to east. Now, if we imagine a particle of atmosphere at\r\nthe North Pole, where it is _at rest_, to be put in motion in a straight\r\nline towards the Equator, we can easily see how this particle of air,\r\ncoming from the very axis of diurnal rotation, where it did not partake\r\nof the diurnal motion, would, in consequence of its own _vis inertiæ_,\r\nfind as it travelled south that the earth was slipping from under it, as\r\nit were, and it would appear to be coming from the north-east and going\r\ntowards the south-west; in other words, it would be a north-east wind.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, the upper currents of air, which proceed towards the\r\nPoles with equatorial rapidity, ought to outstrip the atmospheric beds,\r\nwhich are gifted with much smaller rapidity of motion towards the Poles,\r\nand turn them towards the east in consequence. These are the south-west\r\nand north-west counter trade-winds, which, passing above the _north_ and\r\n_south-east trades_, often sweep the surface of the sea in the latitudes\r\nof the Temperate zone. The two _trades_ are separated by a belt more or\r\nless broad, where the friction experienced at the surface of the sea\r\nneutralizes their impulse towards the west; in general, the current of\r\nair there is an ascending current. This belt, which does not exactly\r\ncorrespond with the Equator, is called the _Zone of Calms_, where\r\natmospheric tempests frequently occur, and the winds make the entire\r\ntour of the compass, which has acquired for them the name of\r\n_tornadoes_.\r\n\r\nThe trade-winds, whose movement towards the west is retarded by the\r\nfriction which the waves of the ocean oppose to them, communicate to\r\nthese waves, by a sort of reaction, a tendency towards the west, or, to\r\nspeak more exactly, towards the south-west in the northern hemisphere,\r\nand towards the north-west in the opposite hemisphere. The currents on\r\nthe surface of the water which result from this reaction, reunite under\r\nthe Equator, and form the _grand equinoctial_ current which impels the\r\nwaters of the east towards the west. This movement is stronger at the\r\nedges than in the middle of the current, because the force which\r\nproduces it acts there with more energy: it results from this, that the\r\ncurrents bifurcate more readily when any obstacle presents itself to its\r\nmovement. In the Atlantic Ocean, bifurcation takes place a little to the\r\nsouth of the Equator; the southern branch descends along the coast of\r\nBrazil, and probably returns by reascending along the west coast of\r\nAfrica. The northern branch follows the coast of Brazil and Guiana,\r\nenters the Sea of the Antilles, and directs its course, reinforced by\r\nthe current which reaches it from the north-east, into the Bay of\r\nHonduras, traverses the Yucatan Channel, and enters the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nwhence it debouches by the Florida Channel, under the name of the _Gulf\r\nStream_. Of this oceanic marvel Dr. Maury observes that \"there is a\r\nriver in the bosom of the ocean; in the several droughts it never fails,\r\nand in the mightiest floods it never overflows; its banks and its bottom\r\nare of cold water, while its current is of warm; it takes its rise in\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, and empties itself into the Arctic Seas. This mighty\r\nriver is the Gulf Stream. In no other part of the world is there such a\r\nmajestic flow of water; its current is more rapid than the Amazon, more\r\nimpetuous than the Mississippi, and its volume is more than a thousand\r\ntimes greater. Its waters, as far as the Carolina coast, are of indigo\r\nblue; they are so distinctly indicated that their line of junction can\r\nbe marked by the eye.\" Such is Dr. Maury's description of this powerful\r\ncurrent of warm water, which traverses the Atlantic Ocean, and\r\ninfluences in no slight manner the climate of Northern Europe, and\r\nespecially our own shores.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Stream thus described by the American _savant_ issues from the\r\nFlorida Channel, with a breadth of thirty-four miles, and a depth of two\r\nthousand two hundred feet, moving at the rate of four and a half miles\r\nper hour. The temperature of the water in the vicinity is about thirty\r\ndegrees Cent. From the American coast the current takes a north-east\r\ndirection towards Spitzbergen, its velocity and volume diminishing as it\r\nexpands in breadth. Towards the forty-third degree of latitude it forms\r\ntwo branches, one of which strikes the coast of Ireland and of Norway,\r\nwhither it frequently transports seeds of tropical origin: it also warms\r\nthe frozen waters of the glacial sea. The other branch, inclining\r\ntowards the south, not far from the Azores, visits the coast of Africa,\r\nwhence it returns to the Antilles. Throughout this vast circuit may be\r\nseen all sorts of plants and driftwood, with waifs and strays of every\r\ndescription borne on the bosom of the ocean. \"Midway the Atlantic, in\r\nthe triangular space between the Azores, Canaries, and Cape de Verd\r\nIslands, is the great Sargasso Sea, covering an area equal in extent to\r\nthe Mississippi Valley: it is so thickly matted over with the Gulf Weed\r\n(_Sargassum bacciferum_), that the speed of vessels passing through it\r\nis actually retarded, and to the companions of Columbus it seemed to\r\nmark the limits of navigation; they became alarmed. To the eye at a\r\nlittle distance it seemed sufficiently substantial to walk upon.\" These\r\nmoving vegetable masses, always green, which tail off to a steady\r\nbreeze, serving as an anemometer to the mariner, afford an asylum to\r\nmultitudes of mollusks and crustaceans.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Stream plays a grand part in the Atlantic system. It carries\r\nthe tepid water of the equinoctial regions into the high latitudes;\r\nbeyond the fortieth parallel the temperature is sixteen degrees Cent.\r\nUrged by the south-west winds which predominate in that zone, its tepid\r\nwaters mix with those of the Northern Sea, softening the rigour of the\r\nclimate in these regions. To the south of the great bank of\r\nNewfoundland, the warm current, in vast volume rushing from the Florida\r\nStraits, meets the cold currents descending from the Arctic Circle\r\nthrough Baffin's Bay and the Sea of Greenland, running with equal\r\nvelocity towards the south. A portion of these waters reascend towards\r\nthe Pole along the western coast of Greenland. It is to this conflict of\r\nthe polar and equatorial waters, that the formation of the banks of\r\nNewfoundland is ascribed. Each of these great currents having\r\nunceasingly deposited the débris carried in its bosom, the bank has been\r\nthus formed bit by bit in the concourse of ages.\r\n\r\nThe difference of temperature between the Gulf Stream and the waters it\r\ntraverses gives birth inevitably to tempests and _cyclones_. In 1780 a\r\nterrible storm ravaged the Antilles, in which twenty thousand persons\r\nperished. The ocean quitted its bed and inundated whole cities; the\r\ntrunks of trees, mingled with other débris, were tossed into the air.\r\nNumerous catastrophes of this kind have earned for the Gulf Stream the\r\ntitle of the King of the Tempests. In consequence of the numerous\r\nnautical documents which have been placed at the command of the National\r\nObservatory of Washington, and the admirable use made of them by the\r\nlate Naval Secretary and his assistants, the directions and range of\r\nthese cyclones engendered by the Gulf Stream may be foreseen, and their\r\nmost dangerous ravages turned aside. As an example of the utility of Dr.\r\nMaury's labours in settling the direction of storms in the traject of\r\nthe Gulf Stream, we quote a well-known instance: In the month of\r\nDecember, 1859, the American packet _San Francisco_ was employed as a\r\ntransport to convey a regiment to California. It was overtaken by one of\r\nthese sudden storms, which placed the ship and its freight in a most\r\ndangerous position. A single wave, which swept the deck, tore out the\r\nmasts, stopped the engines, and washed overboard a hundred and\r\ntwenty-nine persons, officers and soldiers. From that moment the\r\nunfortunate steamer floated upon the waters, a waif abandoned to the\r\nfury of the wind. The day after the disaster the _San Francisco_ was\r\nseen in this desperate situation by a ship which reached New York,\r\nalthough unable to assist her. Another ship met her some days after,\r\nbut, like the other, could render no assistance. When the report reached\r\nNew York, two steamers were despatched to her assistance; but in what\r\ndirection were they to go? what part of the ocean were they to explore?\r\nThe luminaries of Washington Observatory were appealed to! Having\r\nconsulted his charts as to the direction and limits of the Gulf Stream\r\nat that period of the year, Dr. Maury traced on a chart the spot to\r\nwhich the disabled steamer was likely to be driven by the current, and\r\nthe course to be taken by the vessels sent to her assistance. The crew\r\nand passengers of the _San Francisco_ were saved before their arrival.\r\nThree ships, which had seen their distressing situation, had been able\r\nto reach them, and the steamers sent to their assistance only arrived\r\nto witness the safety of the passengers and crew. But the point where\r\nthe steamer foundered shortly after they were transferred to the\r\nrescuing ships was precisely that indicated by Dr. Maury. If the ships\r\nsent to their assistance had reached in time, the triumph of SCIENCE\r\nwould have been complete.\r\n\r\nThe equinoctial currents of the Pacific are very imperfectly known. It\r\nis believed, however, that they traverse the Great Ocean in its whole\r\nlength, and bifurcate opposite the Asiatic coast, where the weakest\r\nbranch bends northward until it encounters the polar current from\r\nBehring's Straits, when it returns along the Mexican coast. The larger\r\nbranch inclines towards the south, passing round Australia, where it is\r\nmet by one or many counter currents coming from the Indian Ocean--of the\r\ncomplicated and dangerous nature of which both Cook and La Peyrouse\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nThe cold waters from the Antarctic Pole are carried towards the Equator\r\nby three great oceanic rivers. The first bifurcates in forty-five\r\ndegrees; one portion goes round Cape Horn; the other--Humboldt's\r\ncurrent--ascends the Chilian and Peruvian coasts up to the Equator,\r\nameliorating the rainless climate as it goes, and making it delightful.\r\nA second great current takes the direction of the African coast, and is\r\ndivided at the Cape, ascending both the east and west coasts of Africa.\r\nOn either side of the warm current which escapes from the intertropical\r\nparts of the Indian Ocean, but especially along the Australian coast, a\r\npolar current wends its way from the Antarctic regions, carrying\r\nsupplies of cold water to modify the climate and restore the equilibrium\r\nin that part of the world. This cold current turns at first towards the\r\nwest, then towards the south in the direction of Madagascar; more to the\r\nsouth still it is driven back by the polar current from Cape Horn. It is\r\nthus that the warm waters from the Bay of Bengal, pressed by the Indian\r\npolar current, circulate between Africa and Australia, one lateral\r\nbranch of the current sweeping along the south coast of this vast\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe monsoons which reign in the Indian Ocean tend still more to\r\ncomplicate the currents, already sufficiently intricate and confused.\r\nBut it is not intended at present to occupy the reader's attention\r\nfurther with these questions of intricate currents.\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of a submarine current which appears to carry\r\nthe waters of the Mediterranean into the Atlantic Ocean. Its existence\r\nis in some respects established by calculations which prove that the\r\nquantity of salt water supplied by the upper current through the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar is equal to seventy-two cubic miles per annum, while the\r\nquantity of fresh water brought down by the rivers is equal to six, and\r\nthe quantity lost by evaporation to twelve cubic miles per annum. This\r\nwould leave an annual excess of sixty-six cubic miles, if the\r\nequilibrium was not re-established by an under current flowing into the\r\nAtlantic. This hypothesis would appear to have been confirmed by a very\r\ncurious fact.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the seventeenth century, a Dutch brig, pursued by the\r\nFrench corsair _Phoenix_, was overhauled between Tangier and Tarifa, and\r\nseemed to be sunk by a single broadside; but, in place of foundering and\r\ngoing down, the brig, being freighted with a cargo of oil and alcohol,\r\nfloated between the two currents, and, drifting towards the west,\r\nfinally ran aground, after two or three days, in the neighbourhood of\r\nTangier, more than twelve miles from the spot where she had disappeared\r\nunder the waves. She had therefore traversed that distance, drawn by the\r\naction of the under current in a direction opposite to that of the\r\nsurface current. This ascertained fact, added to some recent\r\nexperiments, lend their support to the opinion which admits of the\r\nexistence of an outward current through the Straits of Gibraltar. Dr.\r\nMaury quotes an extract from the \"log\" of Lieutenant Temple, of the\r\nUnited States Navy, bearing the same inference. At noon on the 8th of\r\nMarch, 1855, the ship _Levant_ stood into Almeria Bay, where many ships\r\nwere waiting for a chance to get westwards. Here he was told that at\r\nleast a thousand sail were waiting between the bay and Gibraltar, \"some\r\nof them having got as far as Malaga only to be swept back again.\r\nIndeed,\" he adds, \"no vessel had been able to get out into the Atlantic\r\nfor three months past.\" Supposing this current to run no faster than two\r\nknots an hour, and assuming its depth to be four hundred feet only, and\r\nits width seven miles, and that it contained the average proportion of\r\nsolid matter, estimated at one-thirtieth, it appears that salt enough to\r\nmake eighty-eight cubic miles of solid matter were carried into the\r\nMediterranean in those ninety days. \"Now,\" continues Dr. Maury, \"unless\r\nthere were some escape for all this solid matter which has been running\r\ninto the sea, not for ninety days, but for ages, it is very clear that\r\nthe Mediterranean would long ere this have been a vat of strong brine,\r\nor a bed of cubic crystals.\"\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, Dr. Maury considers it certain that there is an\r\nunder current to the south of Cape Horn, which carries into the Pacific\r\nOcean the overflowings of the Atlantic. In fact, the Atlantic is fed\r\nunceasingly by the Great American rivers, while the Pacific receives no\r\nimportant affluent, but ought to be, and is, subjected to enormous\r\nlosses, in consequence of the evaporation continually taking place at\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIDES.\r\n\r\nTides are periodical movements produced by the attraction of the sun and\r\nmoon. This action, which influences the whole mass of the earth, is made\r\nmanifest by the swelling movement of the waters. The attractive force\r\nexercised by the moon is three times that of the sun, in consequence of\r\nits approximation to the earth, as compared to the greater luminary.\r\n\r\nIn order to comprehend the theory of tides, we shall first consider the\r\n_lunar_ influences, putting aside for a moment the _solar_ action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Lunar Tides.]\r\n\r\nThe attraction which the moon exercises upon any point on the earth's\r\nsurface is in the inverse ratio of the square of its distance. If we\r\ndraw a straight line from the moon passing through the centre of the\r\nearth, this line will meet the surface of the waters at two points\r\ndiametrically opposite to each other--namely, Z and N (Fig. 5); one of\r\nthese points would be to the moon its _zenith_, the other its _nadir_.\r\nThe point of the sea which has the moon in the zenith--namely, that\r\nabove which the moon is perfectly perpendicular--will be nearest to the\r\nplanet, and will consequently be more strongly attractive to the centre\r\nof the earth, while the points diametrically opposite to which the moon\r\nis the _nadir_ will be more distant, and consequently less strongly\r\nattracted by that luminary. It follows that the waters situated directly\r\nunder the moon will be attracted towards it, and form an accumulation or\r\nswelling at that point; the waters at the antipodes being less strongly\r\nattracted to the moon than to the centre of the earth, will form also a\r\nsecondary swelling on the surface of the sea, thus forming a double\r\ntide, accumulating at the point nearest the moon and at its antipodes.\r\nAt the intermediate points of the circumference of the globe, where the\r\nwaters are not subjected to the direct attraction of the moon, the sea\r\nis at low water, as represented in Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nThe earth, in its movement of rotation, presents, in the course of\r\ntwenty-four hours, every meridian on its surface to the lunar\r\nattraction; consequently, each point in its turn, and at intervals of\r\nsix hours, is either under the moon, or ninety degrees removed from it:\r\nit follows, that in the space of a lunar day--that is to say, in the\r\ntime which passes between two successive passages of the moon on the\r\nsame meridian--the oceanic waters will be at high and low tide twice in\r\nthe month on every point of the surface of the globe. But this result of\r\nattraction is not exercised instantaneously. The moon has passed from\r\nthe meridian of the spot before the waters have attained their greatest\r\nheight; the flux reaches its maximum about three hours after the moon\r\nhas culminated; and the watery mountain follows the moon all round the\r\nglobe, from east to west, about three hours in its rear.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, however, that the great inequalities of the bottom of the\r\nsea; the existence of continents; the slopes of the coast, more or less\r\nsteep; the different breadths of channels and straits; finally, the\r\nwinds, the pelagic currents, and a crowd of local circumstances,--must\r\nmaterially modify the course of the tides. Nor is the moon the only\r\ncelestial body which influences the rise and fall of the waters of the\r\nsea. We have already said that the sun asserts an influence on the\r\nwaves. It is true that, in consequence of its great distance, this only\r\namounts to a thirty-eight-hundredth part of that of the earth's\r\nsatellite. The inequality which exists between the solar and lunar\r\ndays--the latter exceeding the first by fifty-four minutes--has also the\r\neffect of adding to or subtracting from this force alternately. When the\r\nsun and moon are in _conjunction_ (Fig. 6), or in opposition, that is to\r\nsay, placed upon the same right line, their attraction on the sea is\r\ncombined, and a _spring_ tide is produced. This happens at the period of\r\nthe _syzygies_--the period of new and full moon. At the period of the\r\n_quadrature_, or the first and last quarters, the solar action, being\r\nopposed to that of lunar attraction, tends to produce a sensibly weaker\r\ntide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Lunar-Solar Tides.]\r\n\r\nThese effects are never produced instantaneously; but, the impulse once\r\ngiven, it will continue to influence the tides for two or three days,\r\nthe highest and lowest tides being nearly in the proportion of 138 to\r\n63, or of 7 to 3. The highest tides occur at the _equinoxes_, when the\r\nmoon is in perigee; the lowest at the _solstices_, when it is in apogee.\r\nIn our ports, and along the coast, the water rises twice in twenty-four\r\nhours, when it is said to be high water; when it retires, it is low\r\nwater: they are respectively the _flux_ and _reflux_ of the waves.\r\n\r\nThe tide is retarded every day about fifty minutes, the lunar day being\r\ntwenty-four hours fifty minutes of mean time. If, for instance, it is\r\nhigh water to-day at two o'clock in the morning, that of the next day\r\nwill take place at fifty minutes past two. Low water does not occur,\r\nhowever, at the half of the intermediate time; the flux is more rapid\r\nthan the reflux: thus at Havre, Boulogne, and at corresponding places on\r\nthis side of the Channel, it takes two hours and eight minutes more in\r\nretiring; at Brest, the difference is only sixteen minutes more than the\r\nflux. The daily retardation of high water by the passage of the moon in\r\nthe meridian, at the equinoxes, is a constant quantity for the same\r\nlocality, which can be determined by direct observation.\r\n\r\nThe height of the tide varies in the different regions of the globe,\r\naccording to local circumstances. The eastern coast of Asia and the\r\nwestern coast of Europe are exposed to extremely high tides; while in\r\nthe South Sea Islands, where they are very regular, they scarcely reach\r\nthe height of twenty inches. On the western coast of South America, the\r\ntides rarely reach three yards; on the western coast of India they reach\r\nthe height of six or seven; and in the Gulf of Cambay it ranges from\r\nfive to six fathoms. This great difference makes itself felt in our own\r\nand adjoining countries: thus, the tide, which at Cherbourg is seven and\r\neight yards high, attains the height of fourteen yards at Saint Malo,\r\nwhile it reaches the height of ten yards at Swansea, at the mouth of the\r\nBristol Channel, increasing to double that height at Chepstow, higher up\r\nthe river. In general, the tide is higher at the bottom of a gulf than\r\nat its mouth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe highest tide which is known occurs in the Bay of Fundy, which opens\r\nup to the south of the isthmus uniting Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\r\nThere the tide reaches forty, fifty, and even sixty feet, while it only\r\nattains the height of seven or eight in the bay to the north of the same\r\nisthmus. It is related that a ship was cast ashore upon a rock during\r\nthe night, so high, that at daybreak the crew found themselves and their\r\nship suspended in mid-air far above the water!\r\n\r\nIn the Mediterranean, which only communicates with the ocean by a narrow\r\nchannel, the phenomenon of tides is scarcely felt, and from this\r\ncause--that the moon acts at the same time upon its whole surface, which\r\nare not sufficiently abundant to increase the swelling mass of waters\r\nformed by the moon's attraction; consequently, the swelling remains\r\nscarcely perceptible. This is the reason why neither the Black Sea or\r\nWhite Sea presents a tide, and the Mediterranean a very inconsiderable\r\none. Nevertheless, at Alexandria the tide rises twenty inches, and at\r\nVenice this height is increased to about six feet and a half. Lake\r\nMichigan is slightly affected by the lunar attraction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Whewell has prepared maps, in which the course of the tidal\r\nwave is traced in every country of the globe. We see here that it\r\ntraverses the Atlantic, from the fiftieth degree of south latitude up to\r\nthe fiftieth parallel north, at the rate of five hundred and sixty miles\r\nan hour. But the rapidity with which it proceeds is least in shallow\r\nwater. In the North Sea it travels at the rate of a hundred and eighty\r\nmiles. The tidal wave which proceeds round the coast of Scotland\r\ntraverses the German Ocean and meets in St. George's Channel, between\r\nEngland and Ireland, where the conflict between the two opposing waves\r\npresents some very complicated phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe winds, again, exercise a great influence on the height of the tides.\r\nWhen the impulse of the wind is added to that of the attracting planet,\r\nthe normal height of the wave is considerably increased. If the wind is\r\ncontrary, the flux of the tide is almost annihilated. This happens in\r\nthe Gulf of Vera Cruz, where the tide is only perceptible once in three\r\ndays, when the wind blows with violence. An analogous phenomenon is\r\nobservable on the coast of Tasmania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Point du Raz, Coast of Brittany.]\r\n\r\nThe rising tide sometimes strikes the shore with a continuous and\r\nincredible force. This violent shock is called the _surf_. The swell\r\nthen forms a billow, which expands to half a mile. The surf increases as\r\nit approaches the coast, when it sometimes attains the height of six or\r\nseven yards, forming an overhanging mountain of water, which gradually\r\nsinks as it rolls over itself. But this motion is not in reality\r\nprogressive--it transports no floating body. The surf is very strong at\r\nthe Isle of Fogo, one of the Cape de Verd Islands in the Indian Ocean,\r\nand at Sumatra, where the surf renders it dangerous and sometimes\r\nimpossible to land on the coast. Fig. 7 represents the effects of the\r\nsurf at Point du Raz, on the coast of Brittany. The winds adding their\r\ninfluence to these causes, give birth on the surface of the sea to waves\r\nor billows, which increase rapidly, rising in foaming mountains,\r\nrolling, bounding, and breaking one against the other. \"In one moment,\"\r\nsays Malte Brun, \"the waves seem to carry sea-goddesses on its breast,\r\nwhich seem to revel amid plays and dances; in the next instant, a\r\ntempest rising out of them, seems to be animated by its fury. They seem\r\nto swell with passion, and we think we see in them marine monsters which\r\nare prepared for war. A strong, constant, and equal wind produces long\r\nswelling billows, which, rising on the same line, advance with a uniform\r\nmovement, one after the other, precipitating themselves upon the coast.\r\nSometimes these billows are suspended by the wind or arrested by some\r\ncurrent, thus forming, as it were, a liquid wall. In this position,\r\nunhappy is the daring navigator who is subjected to its fury.\" The\r\nhighest waves are those which prevail in the offing off the Cape of Good\r\nHope at the period of high tide, under the influence of a strong\r\nnorth-west wind, which has traversed the South Atlantic, pressing its\r\nwaters towards the Cape. \"The billows there lift themselves up in long\r\nridges,\" says Dr. Maury, \"with deep hollows between them. They run high\r\nand fast, tossing their white caps aloft in the air, looking like the\r\ngreen hills of a rolling prairie capped with snow, and chasing each\r\nother in sport. Still, their march is stately, and their roll majestic.\r\nThe scenery among them is grand. Many an Australian-bound trader, after\r\ndoubling the Cape, finds herself followed for weeks at a time by these\r\nmagnificent rolling swells, furiously driven and lashed by the \"brave\r\nwest winds.\" These billows are said to attain the height of thirty, and\r\neven forty feet; but no very exact measurement of the height of waves is\r\nrecorded. One of these mountain waves placed between two ships conceals\r\neach of them from the other--an effect which is partially represented in\r\nFig. 8. In rounding Cape Horn, waves are encountered from twenty to\r\nthirty feet high; but in the Channel they rarely exceed the height of\r\nnine or ten feet, except when they come in contact with some powerful\r\nresisting obstacle. Thus, when billows are dashed violently against the\r\nEddystone Lighthouse, the spray goes right over the building, which\r\nstands a hundred and thirty feet above the sea, and falls in torrents on\r\nthe roof. After the storm of Barbadoes in 1780, some old guns were\r\nfound on the shore, which had been thrown up from the bottom of the sea\r\nby the force of the tempests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Height of Waves off the Cape of Good Hope.]\r\n\r\nIf the waves, in their reflux, meet with obstacles, whirlpools and\r\nwhirlwinds are the result--the former the terror of navigators. Such are\r\nthe whirlpools known in the Straits of Messina, between the rocks of\r\nCharybdis and Scylla, celebrated as the terror of ancient mariners, and\r\nwhich were sung by Homer, Ovid, and Virgil:--\r\n\r\n    \"Scylla latus dextrum, lævum irrequieta Charybdis,\r\n    Infestat; vorat hæc raptis revomitque carinas.\r\n    ... Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim.\"\r\n\r\nThese rocks are better understood, and less redoubted in our days. At\r\nCharybdis, there is a foaming whirlpool; at Scylla, the waves dash\r\nagainst the low wall of rock which forms the promontory, scarcely\r\nnoticed by the navigator of our days.\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated whirlpool is that of Euripus, near the Island of\r\nEuboea; another is known in the Gulf of Bothnia. But perhaps the best\r\nknown rocky danger is the Maelström, whose waters have a gyratory\r\nmovement, producing a whirlpool at certain states of the tide, the\r\nresult of opposing currents, which change every six hours, and which,\r\nfrom its power and magnitude, is capable of attracting and engulfing\r\nships to their destruction, although chiefly dangerous to smaller craft.\r\n\r\nTo the combined effects of tides and whirlpools may also be attributed\r\nthe hurricanes, so dreaded by navigators, which so frequently visit the\r\nMauritius and other parts of the Indian Ocean. In periods of the utmost\r\ncalms, when there is scarcely a breath to ruffle the air, these shores\r\nare sometimes visited by immense waves, accompanied by whirlwinds, which\r\nseem capable of blowing the ships out of the water, seizing them by the\r\nkeel, whirling them round on an axis, and finally capsizing them. \"At\r\nthe period of the changing monsoon, the winds, breaking loose from their\r\ncontrolling forces, seem to rage with a fury capable of breaking up the\r\nvery fountains of the deep.\"\r\n\r\nThe hurricanes of the Atlantic occur in the months of August and\r\nSeptember, while the south-west monsoon of Africa and the southeast\r\nmonsoon of the West Indies are at their height; the agents of the one\r\ndrawing the north-east trade-winds into the interior of Mexico and\r\nTexas, the other drawing them into the interior of Africa, greatly\r\ndisturbing the equilibrium of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLAR SEAS.\r\n\r\nThe extreme columns of the known world are Mount Parry, situated at\r\neight degrees from the North Pole, and Mount Ross, twelve degrees from\r\nthe South Pole. Beyond these limits our maps are mute; a blank space\r\nmarks each extremity of the terrestrial axis. Will man ever succeed in\r\npassing these icy barriers? Will he ever justify the prediction of the\r\npoet Seneca, who tells us that \"the time will come in the distant future\r\nwhen Ocean will relax her hold on the world, when the immense earth will\r\nbe open, when Tethys will appear amid new orbs, and where Thule\r\n(Iceland) shall no longer be the extreme limit of the earth?\"\r\n\r\n          \"Venient annis\r\n    Sæcula seris quibus oceanus\r\n    Vincula rerum laxet et ingens\r\n    Pateat tellus, Tethysque novos\r\n    Detegat orbes, nec sit terris\r\n    Ultime Thule.\"\r\n\r\n    _Medea._\r\n\r\nNo one can say. Every step we have taken in order to approach the Pole\r\nhas been dearly purchased; and it is not without reason that navigators\r\nhave named the south point of Greenland, Cape Farewell. Of the number of\r\nexpeditions, for the most part English, which have been fitted out, at\r\nthe cost of nearly a million sterling, to explore the Frozen Ocean,\r\none-twentieth have had for their mission to ascertain the fate of the\r\nlamented Sir John Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe first navigator who penetrated to Arctic polar regions was Sebastian\r\nCabot, who in 1498 sought a north-west passage from Europe to China and\r\nthe Indies. Considering the date, and the state of navigation at that\r\nperiod, this was perhaps the boldest attempt on record. Scandinavian\r\ntraditions attribute similar undertakings to the son of the King Rodian,\r\nwho lived in the seventh century; to Osher, the Norwegian, in 873; and\r\nto the Princes Harold and Magnus, in 1150.\r\n\r\nSebastian Cabot reached as high as Hudson's Bay, but a mutiny of his\r\nsailors forced him to retrace his steps. In 1500, Gaspard de Cortereal\r\ndiscovered Labrador; in 1553, Sir Hugh Willoughby Nova Zembla; and\r\nChancellor the White Sea, about the same time. Davis visited in 1585 the\r\nwest coast of Greenland, and two years later he discovered the strait\r\nwhich bears his name. In 1596 Barentz discovered Spitzbergen, which was\r\nagain seen by Hendrich Hudson, who sailed up to and beyond the\r\neighty-second parallel. Three years later Hudson gave his name to the\r\ngreat Labrador Bay, but he could get no farther. His crew also revolted,\r\nand he was left in the ship's launch with his son, seven sailors, and\r\nthe carpenter, who remained faithful. Thus perished one of our greatest\r\nnavigators.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Jan Mayen was discovered in 1611; the channel which Baffin\r\ntook for a bay, and which bears his name, was discovered in 1616.\r\nBehring discovered, in his first voyage in 1727, the strait which\r\nseparates Siberia from America; he sailed through it in 1741, but his\r\nship was stranded, and he himself died of scorbutic disease.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1771 the Polar Sea was discovered by Hearne, a fur merchant;\r\nit was explored long after by Mackenzie.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1810, when Sir John Ross, Franklin, and Parry turned their\r\nattention to the Arctic regions, these expeditions to the Polar Seas\r\nrapidly succeeded each other. In 1827 Parry reached the eighty-second\r\ndegree of north latitude; and in 1845 Sir John Franklin, with the ships\r\n_Erebus_ and _Terror_, and their crews, departed on their last voyage,\r\nfrom which neither he nor his companions ever returned. There is now no\r\ndoubt that they perished miserably, after having discovered the\r\nnorth-west passage, which Captain M'Clure also discovered, coming from\r\nthe opposite direction, in 1850. In 1855 the expedition of Dr. Elisha\r\nKane found the sea open from the Pole.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Antarctic Pole had in the meantime attracted the attention of\r\nnavigators. In 1772 the Dutch captain, Kerguelen, discovered an island\r\nwhich he took for a continent. In 1774 Captain Cook explored these\r\nregions up to the seventy-first degree of latitude. James Weddell, in a\r\nsmall whaler, sailed past this parallel in 1823. Biscoe discovered\r\nEnderby's Land in 1831. The _Zelée_ and _Astrolabe_, under the command\r\nof Captain Dumont D'Urville, of the French Marine, and the American\r\nexpedition, under Captain Wilkes, reached the same region in 1838. The\r\nformer discovered Adelia's Land. Finally, in 1841, Sir James Clark Ross,\r\nnephew of Sir John Ross, with the _Erebus_ and _Terror_, penetrated up\r\nto the seventy-eighth degree south latitude. Here he discovered the\r\nvolcanic islands which he named after his ships, and, farther to the\r\nsouth, a new continent or land, which he called Victoria's Land.\r\n\r\nWhile these efforts were being made to penetrate the ice which surrounds\r\nthe Antarctic Pole, a region having little which could attract human\r\nenterprise, the interests of commerce seemed to call for obstinate and\r\npersevering attempts to penetrate to the Arctic Pole. In spite of these\r\nnumerous expeditions, however, which extend over two centuries, the\r\nregions round the North Pole are far from being known to geographers.\r\nThe fogs and snows which almost always cover them were the source of\r\nmany errors made by the earlier navigators. In his first voyage, made in\r\n1818, Sir John Ross was led to think that Lancaster Sound was closed by\r\na chain of mountains, which he called the Croker Mountains; but in the\r\nfollowing year Captain Parry, in command of two ships, the _Hecla_ and\r\n_Griper_, discovered that this was an error. This celebrated navigator\r\ndiscovered Barrow's Straits, Wellington Channel, and Prince Regent\r\nInlet; Cornwallis, Sir Byam Martin, and Melville Islands, to which the\r\nname of Parry's Archipelago has been given. In this short voyage he\r\ngathered more new results than were obtained by his successors during\r\nthe next forty years. He was the first to traverse these seas. Upon Sir\r\nByam Martin Island he has described the ruins of some ancient\r\nhabitations of the Esquimaux. He passed the winter on Melville Island.\r\nIn order to attain his chosen anchorage in Winter's Bay, he was\r\ncompelled to saw a passage in the ice of a league in length, which\r\ninvolved the labour of three days; but scarcely were they moored in\r\ntheir chosen harbour than the thermometer fell to eighteen degrees below\r\nzero. They carried ashore the ship's boats, the cables, the sails, and\r\nlog-books. The masts were struck to the maintop; the rest of the rigging\r\nserved to form a roof, sloping to the gunwale, with a thick covering of\r\nsail-cloth, which formed an admirable shelter from the wind and snow.\r\nNumberless precautions were taken against cold and wet under the decks.\r\nStoves and other contrivances maintained a supportable degree of\r\ntemperature. In each dormitory a false ceiling of impermeable cloth\r\ninterposed to prevent the collection of moisture on the wooden walls of\r\nthe ship. The crew were divided into companies, each company being under\r\nthe charge of an officer, charged with the daily inspection of their\r\nclothes and cleanliness--an essential protection against scurvy. As a\r\nmeasure of precaution, Captain Parry reduced by one-third the ordinary\r\nration of bread; beer and wine were substituted for spirits; and citron\r\nand lemon drinks were served out daily to the sailors. Game was\r\nsometimes substituted to vary a repast worthy of Spartans. As a remedy\r\nagainst _ennui_, a theatre was fitted up and comedies acted, for which\r\noccasions Parry himself composed a vaudeville, entitled \"The North-west\r\nPassage; or, the End of the Voyage.\" During this long night of\r\neighty-four days, the thermometer in the saloons marked 28°, and outside\r\n35° below zero, and for a few minutes actually reached 47°. Some of the\r\nsailors had their members frozen, from which they never quite recovered.\r\nOne day the hut which served as an observatory was discovered to be on\r\nfire. A sailor who saved one of the precious instruments lost his hands\r\nin the effort; they were completely frost-bitten in the attempt.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the month of June arrived, and with it the opportunity of\r\nmaking excursions in the neighbourhood. It was found that, in Melville\r\nIsland, the earth was carpeted with moss and herbage, with saxifrages\r\nand poppies. Hares, reindeer, the musk-ox, northern geese, plovers,\r\nwhite wolves and foxes, roamed around their haunts, disputing their\r\nbooty with the crew. Captain Parry could not risk a second winter in\r\nthis terrible region. He returned home as soon as the thaw left the\r\npassage open.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, Captain Parry undertook a second voyage with the _Fury_ and\r\n_Hecla_. He visited Hudson's Bay and Fox's Channel. In his third voyage,\r\nundertaken in 1824, he was surprised by the frost in Prince Regent's\r\nChannel, and was constrained to pass the winter there. The _Fury_ was\r\ndismantled, and, being found unfit for service, Captain Parry was\r\nobliged to abandon her and return to England.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Sir James Ross, Parry again put to sea in the _Hecla_, in\r\nApril, 1826. On his third voyage, on leaving Table Island on the north\r\nof Spitzbergen, Parry placed his crew in the two training ships,\r\n_Enterprise_ and _Endeavour_; the first under his own command, the\r\nsecond under orders of Sir James Ross. Sometimes they sailed, sometimes\r\nhauled through the crust of the ice; sometimes the ice, which pierced\r\ntheir shoes, showed itself bristling with points, intersected into\r\nvalleys and little hills, which it was difficult to scale. In spite of\r\nthe courage and energy of their crews, the two ships scarcely advanced\r\nfour miles a day, while the drifting of the ice towards the south led\r\nthem imperceptibly towards their point of departure. They reached\r\nlatitude eighty-two degrees forty-five minutes fifteen seconds, however,\r\nand this was the extreme point which they attained.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, 1829, Sir John Ross, accompanied by his nephew,\r\nJames Clark Ross, again turned towards the Polar Seas. He entered Prince\r\nRegent's Channel, and there he found the _Fury_, which had been\r\ndismantled and abandoned by Parry, in these regions, eight years before.\r\nThe provisions, which the old ship still contained, were quite a\r\nprovidential resource to Ross's crews. The distinguished navigator\r\nexplored the Boothian Peninsula, and passed four years consecutively in\r\nPort Felix, without being able to disengage his vessel, the _Victory_.\r\nThis gave him ample leisure to become familiar with the Esquimaux. Sir\r\nJohn Ross, in his account of this long sojourn in polar countries, has\r\nrecorded many conversations with the natives, which our space does not\r\npermit us to quote. From this terrible position he was extricated, and\r\nemerged with his crew from this icy prison, when all hope of his return\r\nhad been abandoned. After being exposed to a thousand dangers, Ross and\r\nhis crew were at last observed by a whaling ship, which received them on\r\nboard, after many efforts to attract attention. On learning that the\r\nship which had saved them was the _Isabella_, formerly commanded by\r\nCaptain Ross, he made himself known. \"But Captain Ross has been dead two\r\nyears,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nWe need not repeat here the enthusiastic reception Captain Ross and his\r\ncompanions met with on their arrival in London.\r\n\r\nDuring an excursion made by the nephew of the Commander (afterwards Sir\r\nJames Clark Ross), he very closely approached the North Magnetic Pole.\r\nThis was at eight o'clock on the morning of the 1st of June, 1831, on\r\nthe west coast of Boothia. The dip of the magnetic needle was nearly\r\nvertical, being eighty-nine degrees fifty-nine seconds--one minute short\r\nof ninety degrees. The site was a low flat shore, rising into ridges\r\nfrom fifty to sixty feet high, and about a mile inland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nContrary to the judgment of many officers of experience in polar\r\nexplorations, the last and most fatal of all the expeditions was\r\nundertaken by Sir John Franklin, with one hundred and thirty-seven\r\npicked officers and men, in the ships _Erebus_ and _Terror_. The\r\nadventurers left Sheerness on the 26th of May, 1846, the ships having\r\nbeen strengthened in every conceivable way, and found in everything\r\ncalculated to secure the safety of the expedition. On the 22nd of July\r\nthe ships were spoken by the whaler _Enterprise_, and, four days later,\r\nthey were sighted by the _Prince of Wales_, of Hull, moored to an\r\niceberg, waiting an opening to enter Lancaster Sound. There the veil\r\ndropped over the ships and their unhappy crews. In 1848, their fate\r\nbegan to excite a lively interest in the public mind. Expedition in\r\nsearch of them succeeded expedition, at immense cost, sent both by the\r\nEnglish and American authorities, and by Lady Franklin herself, some of\r\nwhich penetrated the Polar Seas through Behring's Straits, while the\r\nmajority took Baffin's Bay. In 1850, Captains Ommaney and Penny\r\ndiscovered, at the entrance of Wellington Channel, some vestiges of\r\nFranklin, which led to another expedition in 1857, which was got up by\r\nprivate enterprise, of which Captain M'Clintock had the command. Guided\r\nby the indications collected in the previous expedition, and\r\nintelligence gathered from the Esquimaux by Dr. Rae in his land\r\nexpedition, Captain M'Clintock in the yacht _Fox_ discovered, on the 6th\r\nof May, 1859, upon the north point of King William's Land, a cairn or\r\nheap of stones. Several leaves of parchment, which were buried under the\r\nstones, bearing date the 28th of April, 1848, solved the fatal enigma.\r\nThe first, dated the 24th of May, 1847, gave some details ending with\r\n\"all well.\" The papers had been dug up twelve months later to record the\r\ndeath of Franklin, on the 11th of June, 1847. The survivors are supposed\r\nto have been on their way to the mouth of the River Back, but they must\r\nhave sunk under the terrible hardships to which they were exposed, in\r\naddition to cold and hunger.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1859, Captain M'Clintock returned to England, bringing\r\nwith him many relics of our lost countrymen, found in the theatre of\r\ntheir misfortunes.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to us to say a few words on the latest voyages\r\nundertaken in the Polar Seas. After the return of Captain M'Clintock, in\r\n1850, Captain M'Clure, leaving Behring's Straits, discovered the\r\nnorth-west passage between Melville and Baring's Island, which passage\r\nhad been sought for without success during so many ages. He saw the\r\nthermometer descend fifty degrees below zero. In the month of October,\r\n1854, he returned to England, and at a subsequent period it was\r\nascertained with certainty that, before his death, Franklin knew of the\r\nother passage which exists to the north of America, to the south of\r\nVictoria Land, and Wollaston.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Dr. Kane entered Smith's Strait in 1853, and advanced\r\ntowards the north upon sledges drawn by dogs; the mean temperature,\r\nwhich ranged between thirty degrees and forty degrees below zero, fell\r\nat last to fifty degrees. At eleven degrees from the Pole they found two\r\nEsquimaux villages, called Etah and Peterovik, then an immense glacier.\r\nA detachment, conducted by Lieutenant Morton, discovered, beyond the\r\neightieth degree of latitude, an open channel inhabited by innumerable\r\nswarms of birds, consisting of swallows, ducks, and gulls, which\r\ndelighted them by their shrill, piercing cries. Seals (_phoca_) enjoyed\r\nthemselves on the floating ice. In ascending the banks, they met with\r\nflowering plants, such as _Lychnis_, _Hesperis_, &c. On the 24th of\r\nJune, Morton hoisted the flag of the _Antarctic_, which had before this\r\nseen the ice of the South Pole, on Cape Independence, situated beyond\r\neighty-one degrees. To the north stretched the open sea. On the left was\r\nthe western bank of the Kennedy Channel, which seemed to terminate in a\r\nchain of mountains, the principal peak rising from nine thousand to ten\r\nthousand feet, which was named Mount Parry. The expedition returned\r\ntowards the south, and reached the port of Uppernavick exhausted with\r\nhunger, where it was received on board an American ship. Dr. Kane,\r\nweakened by his sufferings, from which he never quite recovered, died in\r\n1857.\r\n\r\nWe cannot conclude this rapid sketch of events connected with the\r\nexpeditions to the Arctic Pole without noting a geological fact of great\r\nand singular interest. When opportunities have presented themselves of\r\nexamining the rocks in the regions adjoining the North Pole, it has been\r\nfound that great numbers belong to the coal measures. Such is the case\r\nin Melville Island and Prince Patrick's Island. Under the ice which\r\ncovers the soil in these islands coal exists, with all the fossil\r\nvegetable débris which invariably accompany it. This shows that in the\r\ncoal period of geology, the North Pole was covered with the rich and\r\nabundant vegetation whose remains constitute the coal-fields of the\r\npresent day; and proves to demonstration that the temperature of these\r\nregions was, at one period of the earth's history, equal to that of\r\nequatorial countries of the present day. What a wonderful change in the\r\ntemperature of these regions is thus indicated! It is, indeed, a strange\r\ncontrast to find coal formations under the soil covered by the polar\r\nice. Let us suppose that human industry should dream of establishing\r\nitself in these countries, and drawing from the earth the combustible so\r\nneeded to make it habitable, thus furnishing the means of overcoming the\r\nrigorous climatic conditions of these inhospitable regions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Antarctic Pole is probably surrounded by an icy canopy not less than\r\ntwo thousand five hundred miles in diameter; and numerous circumstances\r\nlead to the conclusion that the vast mass has diminished since 1774,\r\nwhen the region was visited by Captain Cook. The Antarctic region can\r\nonly be approached during the summer, namely, in December, January, and\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nThe first navigator who penetrated the Antarctic circle was the Dutch\r\ncaptain, Theodoric de Gheritk, whose vessel formed part of the squadron\r\ncommanded by Simon de Cordes, destined for the East Indies. In January,\r\n1600, a tempest having dispersed the squadron, Captain Gheritk was\r\ndriven as far south as the sixty-fourth parallel, where he observed a\r\ncoast which reminded him of Norway. It was mountainous, covered with\r\nsnow, stretching from the coast to the Isles of Solomon. The report of\r\nSimon de Cordes was received with great incredulity, and the doubts\r\nraised were only dissipated when the New South Shetland Islands were\r\ndefinitely recognized. The idea of an Antarctic continent is, however,\r\none of the oldest conceptions of speculative geography, and one which\r\nmariners and philosophers alike have found it most difficult to\r\nrelinquish. The existence of a southern continent seemed to them to be\r\nthe necessary counterpoise to the Arctic land. The _Terra Australis\r\nincognita_ is marked on all the maps of Mercator, round the South Pole,\r\nand when the Dutch officer, Kerguelen, discovered, in 1772, the island\r\nwhich bears his name, he quoted this idea of Mercator as the motive\r\nwhich suggested the voyage. In 1774, Captain Cook ventured up to and\r\nbeyond the seventy-first degree of latitude under the one hundred and\r\nninth degree west longitude. He traversed a hundred and eighty leagues,\r\nbetween the fiftieth degree and sixtieth degree of south latitude,\r\nwithout finding the land of which mariners had spoken: this led him to\r\nconclude that mountains of ice, or the great fog-banks of the region,\r\nhad been mistaken for a continent. Nevertheless, Cook clung to the idea\r\nof the existence of a southern continent. \"I firmly believe,\" he says,\r\n\"that near the Pole there is land where most part of the ice is formed\r\nwhich is spread over the vast Southern Ocean. I cannot believe that the\r\nice could extend itself so far if it had not land--and I venture to say\r\nland of considerable extent--to the south. I believe, nevertheless, that\r\nthe greater part of this southern continent ought to lie within the\r\nPolar Circle, where the sea is so encumbered with ice as to be\r\nunapproachable. The danger run in surveying a coast in these unknown\r\nseas is so great, that I dare to say no one will venture to go farther\r\nthan I have, and that the land that lies to the south will always remain\r\nunknown. The fogs are there too dense; the snowstorms and tempests too\r\nfrequent; the cold too severe; all the dangers of navigation too\r\nnumerous. The appearance of the coast is the most horrible that can be\r\nimagined. The country is condemned by nature to remain unvisited by the\r\nsun, and buried under eternal hoar frost. After this report, I believe\r\nthat we shall hear no more of a southern continent.\" This description of\r\nthese desolate regions, to which the great navigator might have applied\r\nthe words of Pliny, \"_Pars mundi a natura damnata et densa mersa\r\ncaligine_,\" only excited the courage of his successors. In our days,\r\nseveral expeditions have been fitted out for the express survey of\r\nregions which may be characterised as the abode of cold, silence, and\r\ndeath. In 1833, a free passage opened itself into the Antarctic Sea. The\r\nScottish whaling ship, commanded by James Weddell, entered the pack ice,\r\nand penetrated it in pursuit of seals; but having, by chance, found the\r\nsea open on his course, he forced his way up to seventy-four degrees\r\nsouth latitude, and under the thirty-fourth degree of longitude, but the\r\nseason was too advanced, and he and his crew retraced their steps. The\r\nvoyage of Captain Weddell caused a great sensation, and suggested the\r\npossibility of more serious expeditions. Twelve years later three great\r\nexpeditions were fitted out: one, under Dumont D'Urville, of the French\r\nMarine; an American expedition, under Captain Wilkes, of the United\r\nStates Navy; and an English expedition, under Sir James Clark Ross.\r\n\r\nDumont D'Urville, who perished so miserably in the railway catastrophe\r\nat Versailles, in 1842, passed the Straits of Magellan on the 9th of\r\nJanuary, 1838, having under his command the two corvettes _Astrolabe_\r\nand _Zelée_. He expected to find it as Weddell had described, and that,\r\nafter passing the first icy barrier, he should find an open sea before\r\nhim. But he was soon compelled to renounce this hope. The floating\r\nicebergs became more and more closely packed and dangerous. The southern\r\nicebergs do not circulate in straits and channels already formed, like\r\nthose of the North Pole, but in enormous detached blocks which hug the\r\nland. Sometimes in shallow water they form belts parallel to the base of\r\nthe cliffs, intersected by a small number of sinuous narrow channels.\r\nThese icy cliffs present a face more or less disintegrated as they\r\napproximate to the rocky shore. The blocks of ice form at first huge\r\nprisms, or tabular, regular masses of a whitish paste; but they get used\r\nup by degrees, and rounded off and separated under the action of the\r\nwaves, which chafe them, and their colour becomes more and more limpid\r\nand bluish. They ascend freely towards the north, in spite of the winds\r\nand currents which carry them in the contrary direction. One year with\r\nanother these floating icebergs accumulate with very striking\r\ndifferences, and it is only by a rare chance that they open up a free\r\npassage such as Captain Weddell had discovered. These floating islands\r\nof ice have been met with in thirty-five degrees south latitude, and\r\neven as high as Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nThe two French ships frequently found themselves shut up in the\r\nicebergs, which continued to press upon them, and driven before the\r\nnorth winds, until the south wind again dispersed their vast masses,\r\nenabling them to issue from their prison in health and safety. In some\r\ncases D'Urville found it necessary to force his ship through fields of\r\nice by which he was surrounded and imprisoned, and to cut his way by\r\nforce through the accumulating blocks, using the corvette as a sort of\r\nbattering-ram. In 1838 he recognized, about fifty leagues from the South\r\nOrkney Isles, a coast, to which he gave the name of _Louis Philippe's_\r\nand _Joinville's Land_. This coast is covered with enormous masses of\r\nice, which seemed to rise to the height of two thousand six hundred\r\nfeet. Ross discovered still more lofty peaks, such as Mount Penny and\r\nMount Haddington, rising about seven thousand feet. The English\r\nnavigator states that this land is only a great island. The crew of\r\nD'Urville's ship being sickly and overworked, he returned to the port of\r\nChili, whence he again issued for the South Pole in the following\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion his approach was made from a point diametrically\r\nopposite to the former. He very soon found himself in the middle of the\r\nice. He discovered within the Antarctic Circle land, to which he gave\r\nthe name of _Adelia's Land_. The long and lofty cliffs of this island or\r\ncontinent he describes as being surrounded by a belt of islands of ice\r\nat once numerous and threatening. D'Urville did not hesitate to navigate\r\nhis corvettes through the middle of the band of enormous icebergs which\r\nseemed to guard the Pole and forbid his approach to it. For some moments\r\nhis vessels were so surrounded that they had reason to fear, from moment\r\nto moment, some terrible shock, some irreparable disaster. In addition\r\nto this, the sea produces around these floating icebergs, eddies, which\r\nwere not unlikely to draw on the ship to the destruction with which it\r\nwas threatened at every instant. It was in passing at their base that\r\nD'Urville was able to judge of the height of these icy cliffs. \"The\r\nwalls of these blocks of ice,\" he says, \"far exceed our masts and\r\nriggings in height; they overhang our ships, whose dimensions seem\r\nridiculously curtailed. We seem to be traversing the narrow streets of\r\nsome city of giants. At the foot of these gigantic monuments we perceive\r\nvast caverns hollowed by the waves, which are engulfed there with a\r\ncrashing tumult. The sun darts his oblique rays upon the immense walls\r\nof ice as if it were crystal, presenting effects of light and shade\r\ntruly magical and startling. From the summit of these mountains,\r\nnumerous brooks, fed by the melting ice produced by the summer heat of a\r\nJanuary sun in these regions, throw themselves in cascades into the icy\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\"Occasionally these icebergs approach each other so as to conceal the\r\nland entirely, and we only perceive two walls of threatening ice, whose\r\nsonorous echoes send back the word of command of the officers. The\r\ncorvette which followed the _Astrolabe_ appeared so small, and its masts\r\nso slender, that the ship's crew were seized with terror. For nearly an\r\nhour we only saw vertical walls of ice.\" Ultimately they reached a vast\r\nbasin, formed on one side by the chain of floating islands which they\r\nhad traversed, and on the other by high land rising three and four\r\nthousand feet, rugged and undulating on the surface, but clothed over\r\nall with an icy mantle, which was rendered dazzlingly imposing in its\r\nwhiteness by the rays of the sun. The officers could only advance by the\r\nship's boats through a labyrinth of icebergs up to a little islet lying\r\nopposite to the coast. They touched the land at this islet; the French\r\nflag was planted, possession was taken of the new continent, and, in\r\nproof of possession, some portions of rock were torn from the scarped\r\nand denuded cliffs. These rocks are composed of quartzite and gneiss.\r\nThe southern continent, therefore, belongs to the primitive formation,\r\nwhile the northern region belongs in great part to the transition, or\r\ncoal formation. According to the map of Adelia's Land, traced by\r\nD'Urville over an extent of thirty leagues of country, the region is one\r\nof death and desolation, without any trace of vegetation.\r\n\r\nA little more to the north, the French navigator had a vague vision on\r\nthe white lines of the horizon of another land, which he named _Côte\r\nClarie_, or Coast Clear, the existence of which was soon confirmed by\r\nthe American expedition under Commodore Wilkes. This officer has\r\nexplored the southern land on a larger scale than any other navigator,\r\nbut he suffered himself to be led into error by the dense fogs of the\r\nregion, and has laid down coast lines on his map where Sir James Boss\r\nsubsequently found only open sea--an error which has very unjustly\r\nthrown discredit on the whole expedition.\r\n\r\nThe English expedition entered this region on Christmas Day, 1840, which\r\nwas passed by Ross in a strong gale, with constant snow or rain. Soon\r\nafter, the first icebergs were seen, having flat tabular summits, in\r\nsome instances two miles in circumference, bounded on all sides by\r\nperpendicular cliffs. On New Year's Day, 1841, the ships crossed the\r\nAntarctic Circle, and reached the edge of the pack ice, which they\r\nentered, after skirting it for several days. On the 5th, the pack was\r\npassed through, amid blinding snow and thick fog, which on clearing away\r\nrevealed an open sea, and on the 11th of January land was seen directly\r\nahead of the ships. A coast line rose in lofty snow-covered peaks at a\r\ngreat distance. On a nearer view, this coast is thus described: \"It was\r\na beautifully clear evening, and two magnificent ranges of mountains\r\nrose to elevations varying from seven thousand to ten thousand feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.\" The glaciers which filled their intervening\r\nvalleys, and which descended from near the mountain summits, projected\r\nin many places several miles into the sea, and terminated in lofty\r\nperpendicular cliffs. In a few places the rocks broke through their icy\r\ncovering, by which alone we could be assured that lava formed the\r\nnucleus of this, to all appearance, enormous iceberg. This antarctic\r\nland was named Victoria Land, in honour of the Queen. It was coasted up\r\nto latitude seventy-eight degrees south, and near to this a magnificent\r\nvolcanic mountain presented itself, rising twelve thousand feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, which emitted flame and smoke in splendid\r\nprofusion. The flanks of this gigantic mountain were clothed with snow\r\nalmost to the mouth of the crater from which the flaming smoke issued.\r\nAt a short distance, Ross discovered the cone of an extinct, or, at\r\nleast, inactive volcano nearly as lofty. He gave to these two volcanoes\r\nthe names of his vessels, _Erebus_ and _Terror_ (Fig. 9)--names\r\nperfectly in harmony with the surrounding desolation. The ice-covered\r\ncliffs rose about a hundred and ninety feet high, and appear to be about\r\nthree hundred feet deep, soundings being found at about four hundred\r\nfathoms. In the distance, towards the south, a range of lofty mountains\r\nwere observed, which Ross named _Mount Parry_, in honour of his old\r\ncommander. When Ross retraced his steps, the expedition had advanced as\r\nfar as the seventy-ninth degree of south latitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Mounts Erebus and Terror.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be said of polar countries, that they form a transition state\r\nbetween land and sea, for water is always present, although in a solid\r\nstate; the surface is always at a very low temperature; snow does not\r\nmelt as it falls, and the sea is thus sometimes covered with a\r\ncontinuous sheet of frozen snow; sometimes with enormous floating blocks\r\nof ice which are driven by the currents. Meeting with these floating\r\nmasses of ice is one of the dangers of polar navigation. Captain\r\nScoresby has given a very detailed description of the different kinds of\r\nice met with in the Arctic Seas. The ice-fields of this writer form\r\nextensive masses of solid water, of which the eye cannot trace the\r\nlimits, some of them being thirty-five leagues in length and ten broad,\r\nwith a thickness of seven to eight fathoms; but generally these\r\nice-fields rise only four to six feet above the water, and reach from\r\nthree to four fathoms beneath the surface. Scoresby has seen these\r\nice-fields forming in the open sea. When the first crystals appear, the\r\nsurface of the ocean is cold enough to prevent snow from melting as it\r\nfalls. On the approach of congelation the surface solidifies, and seems\r\nas if covered with oil; small circles are formed, which press against\r\neach other, and are finally soldered together until they form a vast\r\nfield of ice, the thickness of which increases from the lower surface.\r\n\r\nThe water produced from melted ice is perfectly fresh--the result of a\r\nwell-known physical cause. When a saline solution like sea water is\r\ncongealed by cold, pure water alone passes into the solid state, the\r\nsaline solution becomes more concentrated, increases in density, and,\r\nsinking to the bottom, remains liquid. Blocks of ice, therefore, in the\r\nPolar Seas, are always available for domestic use. There are, however,\r\nsalt blocks of ice, which are distinguished from fresh-water ice by\r\ntheir opaqueness and their dazzling white colour: this saltness is due\r\nto the sea water retained in its interstices. Scoresby amused himself\r\nsometimes by shaping lenses of ice, with which he is said to have set\r\nfire to gunpowder, much to the astonishment of his crew.\r\n\r\nThe ice-fields, which are formed in higher latitudes, are driven towards\r\nthe south by winds and currents, but sooner or later the action of the\r\nwaves breaks them up into fragments. The edges of the broken icebergs\r\nare thus often rising and continually changing: these asperities and\r\nprotuberances are called _hummocks_ by English navigators; they give to\r\nthe polar ice an odd, irregular appearance. Hummocks form themselves of\r\nthe stray, broken icebergs which come in contact with each other at\r\ntheir edges, and thus form vast rafts, the pieces of which may exceed a\r\nhundred yards in length.\r\n\r\nWhen these icebergs are separated by open spaces, through which vessels\r\ncan be navigated, the pack ice is said to be open. But it often happens\r\nthat mountains of ice occur partly submerged, where one edge is retained\r\nunder the principal mass, while the other is above the water. Scoresby\r\nonce passed over a _calf_, as English mariners call these icy mountains,\r\nbut he trembled while he did so, dreading lest it should throw his\r\nvessel, himself, and crew into the air before he could pass it. The\r\naspect of the ice-fields varies in a thousand ways. Here it is an\r\nincoherent chaos resembling some volcanic rocks, with crevices in all\r\ndirections, bristling with unshapely blocks piled up at random; there it\r\nis a strongly-marked plain, an immense mosaic formed of vast blocks of\r\nice of every age and thickness, the divisions of which are marked by\r\nlong ridges of the most irregular forms; sometimes resembling walls\r\ncomposed of great rectangular blocks, sometimes resembling chains of\r\nhills, with great rounded summits.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, when a thaw sets in, and the fields begin to break up,\r\nthe pieces of light ice which unite the great blocks into unique masses\r\nare the first to melt; the several blocks then separate, and the motion\r\nof the water soon disperses them, and the imprisoned ships find a free\r\npassage. But a day of calm is still sufficient to unite the dispersed\r\nmasses, which oscillate and grind against each other with a strange\r\nnoise, which sailors compare to the yelping of young dogs.\r\n\r\nWhen a ship is shut up in one of these floating ice-fields, inexplicable\r\nchanges sometimes occur in the vast incoherent aggregations. Vessels,\r\nwhich think themselves immovable, are found in a few hours to have\r\ncompletely reversed their positions. Two ships shut in at a short\r\ndistance from each other were driven many leagues without being able to\r\nperceive any change in the surrounding ice. At other times ships are\r\ndrawn with the floating ice-fields, like the white bears, who make long\r\nvoyages at sea upon these monster vehicles. In 1777 the Dutch vessel,\r\nthe _Wilhelmina_, was driven with some other whaling ships from eighty\r\ndegrees north back to sixty-two degrees, in sight of the Iceland coast.\r\nDuring this terrible journey the ships were broken up one after the\r\nother. More than two hundred persons perished, and the remainder reached\r\nland with difficulty.\r\n\r\nLieutenant De Haven, navigating in search of Sir John Franklin, was\r\ncaught in the ice in the middle of the channel in Wellington Strait.\r\nDuring the nine months which he remained in captivity, he drifted nearly\r\nthirteen hundred miles towards the south; and the ship _Resolute_,\r\nabandoned by Captain Kellet in an ice-field of immense extent, was\r\ndrifted towards the south with this vast mass to a much greater\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nSome curious speculations are hazarded by Dr. Maury, arising out of his\r\ninvestigations of winds and currents, facts being revealed which\r\nindicate the existence of a climate, mild by comparison, within the\r\nAntarctic Circle. These indications are a low barometer, a high degree\r\nof aerial rarefaction, and strong winds from the north. \"The winds,\" he\r\nsays, \"were the first to whisper of this strange state of things, and to\r\nintimate to us that the Antarctic climates are in winter very unlike the\r\nArctic for rigour and severity.\" The result of an immense mass of\r\nobservation on the polar and equatorial winds reveals a marked\r\ndifference in atmospherical movements north, as compared with the same\r\nmovements south of the Equator; the equatorial winds of the northern\r\nhemisphere being only in excess between the tenth and thirteenth\r\nparallel, while those of the southern hemisphere are dominant over a\r\nzone of forty-five degrees, or from thirty-five degrees south to ten\r\ndegrees north.\r\n\r\n\"The fact that the influence of the polar indraught upon the winds\r\nshould extend from the Antarctic to the parallel of forty degrees south,\r\nwhile that from the Arctic is so feeble as scarcely to be felt in fifty\r\ndegrees north, is indicative enough as to the difference in degree of\r\naerial rarefaction over the two regions. The significance of the fact is\r\nenhanced by the consideration that the 'brave west winds,' which are\r\nbound to the place of greatest rarefaction, rush more violently and\r\nconstantly along to their destination than do the counter-trades of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere. Why should these polar-bound winds differ so much\r\nin strength and prevalence, unless there be a much more abundant supply\r\nof caloric, and, consequently, a higher degree of rarefaction, at one\r\npole than at the other?\"\r\n\r\nThat this is the case is confirmed by all known barometrical\r\nobservations, which are very much lower in the Antarctic than in the\r\nArctic, and Dr. Maury thinks this is doubtless due to the excess in\r\nAntarctic regions of aqueous vapour and this latent heat.\r\n\r\n\"There is rarefaction in the Arctic regions. The winds show it, the\r\nbarometer attests it, and the fact is consistent with the Russian theory\r\nof a Polynia in polar waters. Within the Antarctic Circle, on the\r\ncontrary, the winds bring air which has come over the water for the\r\ndistance of hundreds of leagues all around; consequently, a large\r\nportion of atmospheric air is driven away from the austral regions by\r\nthe force of vapour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\n    \"See what a lovely shell, small and pure as a pearl,\r\n    Frail, but a work divine, made so fairly well,\r\n    With delicate spore and whorl, a miracle of design.\"\r\n\r\n    TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The appearance of the open sea,\" says Frédol, from whose elegant work\r\nthis chapter is chiefly compiled, \"far from the shore--the boundless\r\nocean--is to the man who loves to create a world of his own, in which he\r\ncan freely exercise his thoughts, filled with sublime ideas of the\r\nInfinite. His searching eye rests upon the far-distant horizon. He sees\r\nthere the ocean and the heavens meeting in a vapoury outline, where the\r\nstars ascend and descend, appear and disappear in their turn. Presently\r\nthis everlasting change in nature awakens in him a vague feeling of that\r\nsadness 'which,' says Humboldt, 'lies at the root of all our heartfelt\r\njoys.'\"\r\n\r\nEmotions of another kind and equally serious are produced by the\r\ncontemplation and study of the habits of the innumerable organized\r\nbeings which inhabit the great deep. In fact, that immense expanse of\r\nwater, which we call the sea, is no vast liquid desert; life dwells in\r\nits bosom as it does on dry land. Here this mystery reigns supreme in\r\nthe midst of its expansions, luxuries, and agitations. It pleases the\r\nCreator. It is the most beautiful, the most brilliant, the noblest, and\r\nthe most incomprehensible of His manifestations. Without life, the world\r\nwould be as nothing. The beings endowed with it transmit it faithfully\r\nto other beings, their children, and their successors, which will be,\r\nlike them, the depositaries of the same mysterious gift; the marvellous\r\nheritage thus traverses years and hundreds of years without losing its\r\npowers; the globe is redolent with the life which has been so\r\nbounteously distributed over it. In the words of Lamartine, \"We know\r\nwhat produces life, but we know not what it is;\" and this ignorance is\r\nperhaps the powerful attraction which provokes our curiosity and excites\r\nus to study.\r\n\r\nEvery living being is animated by two principles, between which a silent\r\nbut incessant combat is being carried on--_life_, which assimilates, and\r\n_death_, which disintegrates. At first, life is all powerful--it lords\r\nit over matter; but its reign is limited. Beyond a certain point its\r\nvigour is gradually impaired; with old age it decays; and is finally\r\nextinguished with time, when the chemical and physical laws seize upon\r\nit, and its organization is destroyed. But the elements, though inert at\r\nfirst, are soon reanimated and occupied with a new life. Every plant,\r\nevery animal is bound up with the past, and is part of the future, for\r\nevery generation which starts into life is only the corollary upon that\r\nwhich expires, and the prelude of another which is about to be born.\r\nLife is the school of death; death is the foster-mother of life.\r\n\r\nLife, however, does not always exhibit itself at the moment of its\r\nformation. It is visible later, and only after other phenomena. In order\r\nto develope itself, a suitable soil or other medium must be prepared,\r\nand other determinate physical and chemical conditions provided. The\r\npresence and diffusion of living beings are no chance products; they\r\nfollow rigorously an order of law. Speaking of the higher forms of\r\nanimal life, the Duke of Argyll says, in his able and satisfactory work,\r\n\"The Reign of Law,\"--\"In all these there is an observed order in the\r\nmost rigid scientific sense, that is, phenomena in uniform connexion and\r\nmutual relations which can be made, and are made, the basis of\r\nsystematic classification. These classifications are imperfect, not\r\nbecause they are founded on ideal connexions where none exist, but only\r\nbecause they fail in representing adequately the subtle and pervading\r\norder which binds together all living things.\"\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of fossils has thrown great light upon the regular and\r\nprogressive development of organization. The evolution of living beings\r\nseems to have commenced with the more rudimentary forms; the more\r\nancient rocks, until very recently, had revealed no traces of life, and\r\nwhat has been revealed tends to confirm this view. In the Cambrian rocks\r\nof Bray Head, county Wicklow, the _Oldhamia_ is a zoophyte of the\r\nsimplest organization, and the Rhizapods found near the bottom of the\r\nAzoic rocks of Canada are the lowest form of living types; and it is\r\nonly in beds of comparatively recent formation that complex organization\r\nexists. Vegetables first show themselves, and even among these the\r\nsimplest forms have priority. Animals afterwards appear, which, as we\r\nhave seen, belong to the least perfect classes. The combinations of\r\nlife, at first simple, have become more and more complex, until the\r\ncreation of man, who may be considered the masterpiece of organization.\r\n\r\nIf we expose a certain quantity of pure water to the light and air in\r\nthe spring, we should soon see it producing shades of a yellowish or\r\ngreenish colour. These spots, examined through the microscope, reveal\r\nthousands of vegetable agglomerates. Presently thousands of animalcules\r\nappear, which swim about among the floating masses, nourishing\r\nthemselves with its substance. Other animalcules then appear, which, in\r\ntheir turn, pursue and devour the first.\r\n\r\nIn short, life transforms inanimate into organized matter. Vegetables\r\nappear first, then come herbivorous animals, and then come the\r\ncarnivorous. Life maintains life. The death of one gives food and\r\ndevelopment to others, for all are bound up together--all assist at the\r\nmetamorphoses continually occurring in the organic as in the mineral\r\nworld, the result being general and profound harmony--harmony always\r\nworthy of admiration. The Creator alone is unchangeable, omnipotent, and\r\npermanent; all else is transition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the water are much more numerous than those of the\r\nsolid earth. \"Upon a surface less varied than we find on continents,\"\r\nsays Humboldt, \"the sea contains in its bosom an exuberance of life of\r\nwhich no other portion of the globe could give us any idea. It expands\r\nin the north as in the south; in the east as in the west. The seas,\r\nabove all, abound with it; in the bosom of the deep, creatures\r\ncorresponding and harmonizing with each other sport and play. Among\r\nthese especially the naturalist finds instruction, and the philosopher\r\nsubjects for meditation. The changes they undergo only impress upon our\r\nminds more and more a sentiment of thankfulness to the Author of the\r\nuniverse.\"\r\n\r\nYes, the ocean in its profoundest depths--its plains and its mountains,\r\nits valleys, its precipices, even in its ruins--is animated and\r\nembellished by innumerable organized beings. These are at first plants,\r\nsolitary or social, erect or drooping, spreading into prairies, grouped\r\nin patches, or forming vast forests in the oceanic valleys. These\r\nsubmarine forests protect and nourish millions of animals which creep,\r\nwhich run, which swim, which sink into the sands, attach themselves to\r\nrocks, lodge themselves in crevices, which construct dwellings for\r\nthemselves, which seek for or fly from each other, which pursue or\r\nfight, caress each other lovingly, or devour each other without pity.\r\nCharles Darwin truly remarks somewhere that our terrestrial forests do\r\nnot maintain nearly so many living beings as those which swarm in the\r\nbosom of the sea. The ocean, which for man is the region of asphyxia and\r\ndeath, is for millions of animals the region of life and health: there\r\nis enjoyment for myriads in its waves; there is happiness on its banks;\r\nthere is the blue above all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sea influences its numerous inhabitants, animal or vegetable, by its\r\ntemperature, by its density, by its saltness, by its bitterness, by the\r\nnever-ceasing agitation of its waves, and by the rapidity of its\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in preceding chapters that the sea only freezes under\r\nintense cold, and then only at the surface, and that at the depth of\r\nfive hundred fathoms the same permanent temperature exists in all\r\nlatitudes. On the other hand, it is agreed that the agitations produced\r\nby the most violent storms are never felt beyond the depth of twelve or\r\nthirteen fathoms. From this it follows that animals and vegetables, by\r\ndescending more or less, according to the cold or disturbing movements,\r\ncan always reach a medium which agrees with their constitutions.\r\n\r\nThe hosts of the sea are distinguished by a peculiar softness. Certain\r\npelagic plants present only a very weak, feeble consistence; a great\r\nnumber are transformed by ebullition into a sort of jelly. The flesh of\r\nmarine animals is more or less flaccid; many seem to consist of a\r\ndiaphanous mucilage. The skeleton of the more perfect species is more or\r\nless flexible and cartilaginous; and it rarely attains, as to weight and\r\nconsistency, the strength of bone exhibited by terrestrial vertebrate\r\nanimals. Nevertheless, both the shells and coral produced in the bosom\r\nof the ocean are remarkable for their stony solidity. Among marine\r\nbodies, in short, we find at once the softest and hardest of organized\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe separation of organized beings, nourished by the ocean, is\r\nsubjected to certain fixed laws. We never find on the coast, except by\r\nevident accident, the same species that we meet with far from the shore;\r\nnor on the surface, creatures whose habits lead them to hide in the\r\ndepths of ocean. What immense varieties of size, shape, form, and\r\ncolour, from the nearly invisible vegetation which serves to nourish the\r\nsmall zoophytes and mollusks, to the long, slender algæ of fifty--and\r\neven five hundred--yards in length! How vast the disparity between the\r\nmicroscopic infusoria and the gigantic whale!\r\n\r\n\"We find in the sea,\" says Lacepede, \"unity and diversity, which\r\nconstitute its beauty; grandeur and simplicity, which give it sublimity;\r\npuissance and immensity, which command our wonder.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following pages we shall figure and describe many inhabitants of\r\nthe sea; but how many remain still to figure and describe! During more\r\nthan two thousand years research has been multiplied, and succeeded by\r\nresearch without interruption. \"But how vast the field,\" as Lamarck\r\nobserves, \"which Science has still to cultivate, in order to carry the\r\nknowledge already acquired to the degree of perfection of which it is\r\nsusceptible!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"When the tide retires from the shore, the sea leaves upon the coast\r\nsome few of the numberless beings which it bears in its bosom. In the\r\nfirst moments of its retreat, the naturalist may collect a crowd of\r\nsubstances, vegetable and animal, with their various characteristic\r\ncolours and properties. The inhabitants of the coast find there their\r\nfood, their commerce, and their occupations. At low water the nearest\r\nvillages and hamlets send their contingents, old and young, men, women,\r\nand children, to the harvest. Some apply themselves to gathering the\r\nriband seaweed (_Zostera_), the membranous _Ulva_, the sombre brown\r\n_Fucus vesiculosus_, formerly a source of great wealth to the dwellers\r\nby the sea, being then much used in making kelp; others gather the small\r\nshells left on the sands; boys mount upon the rocks in search of whelks\r\n(_Buccinum_), mussels (_Mytilus_), detach limpets (_Patella_), and other\r\nedible marine animals, from the rocks to which they have attached\r\nthemselves. On some coasts, shells, as _Mactra_, _Cytheria_, and\r\n_Bucardium_, are sought for their beauty. By turning the stones, or by\r\nsounding the crevices of the rocks with a hook at the end of a lath,\r\npolypes and calmars are sometimes surprised--sometimes even sea and\r\nconger eels, which have sought refuge there; while the pools, left here\r\nand there by the retiring tide, are dragged by nets of very small mesh,\r\nin which the smaller crustaceous mollusks and small fish are secured.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Mediterranean and other inland seas, where the tide is almost\r\ninappreciable, there exist a great number of animals and vegetables\r\nbelonging to the deep sea, which the waves or currents very rarely leave\r\nupon the sea shore. There are others so fugitive, or which attach\r\nthemselves so firmly to the rocks, that we can watch them only in their\r\nhabitats. It is necessary to study them floating on the surface of the\r\nwaves, or in their mysterious retirements. Hence the necessity that\r\nnaturalists should study the living productions of the salt water even\r\nin the bosom of the ocean, and not on the sea shore.\r\n\r\nThe means generally employed for this purpose is a drag-net,\r\nsounding-line, and other engines suitable for scraping the bottom, and\r\nbreaking the harder rocks. In a voyage which Milne Edwards made to the\r\ncoast of Sicily, he formed the idea of employing an apparatus invented\r\nby Colonel Paulin, which consisted of a metallic casque provided with a\r\nvisor of glass, and consequently transparent, which fixed itself round\r\nthe neck by means of a copper collar made water-tight by stuffing--a\r\ndiving-bell, in short, in miniature. It communicated with an air-pump by\r\nmeans of a flexible tube. Four men were employed in serving the pump,\r\ntwo exercising it while the other two rested themselves. Other men held\r\nthe extremity of a cord, which was passed over a pulley attached at a\r\nhigher elevation, and enabled them to hoist up the diver with the\r\nnecessary rapidity in emergencies. A vigilant observer held in his hand\r\na small signal cord. The immersion of the diver was facilitated by heavy\r\nleaden shoes, which assisted him at the same time to maintain his\r\nvertical position at the bottom. M. Edwards made the descent with this\r\napparatus in three fathoms water with perfect success. He was thus\r\nenabled to study, in their most hidden and most inaccessible retreats,\r\nthe radiate animals, mollusks, crustaceans, and annelids, especially\r\ntheir larvæ and eggs, and by his descriptions to contribute most\r\nessentially to make known the functions, manners, and mode of\r\ndevelopment of certain inhabitants of the sea, whose sojourn and habits\r\nwould seem to sequestrate them for ever from our observation.\r\n\r\nAnother and easier mode of studying the living creatures sheltered by\r\nthe sea was first suggested by M. Charles des Moulins of Bordeaux, in\r\n1830. The _aquarium_, which is charged with fresh or salt water,\r\naccording to the beings it is intended to contain, serves the same\r\npurpose for the inhabitants of the deep which the aviary does for the\r\nbirds of the air--cages of glass being used in place of iron wire or\r\nwicker-work, and water in place of atmospheric air.\r\n\r\nWhen a globe is filled with fresh water, and with mollusks, crustaceans,\r\nor fishes, it is observed, after a few days, that the water loses its\r\ntransparency and purity, and becomes slightly corrupt. It necessarily\r\nfollows that the water must be changed from time to time. Changing the\r\nwater, however, causes much suffering, and even death to the animals.\r\nBesides, the new water does not always present the same composition, the\r\nsame aeration, or the same temperature with that which is replaced. To\r\nobviate this defect, and taking a leaf out of Nature's book, M. Moulins\r\nproposed to put into the vase a certain number of aquatic plants\r\nfloating or submerged--duckweed, for example--which would act upon the\r\nwater in a direction inverse to that of the animals inhabiting it. It is\r\nknown that vegetables assimilate carbon, while decomposing the carbonic\r\nacid produced by the respiration of animals, thus disengaging the oxygen\r\nindispensable to animal life. In this simple manner was the necessary\r\nchange of water obviated. The same happy idea has been successfully\r\napplied to salt water, and aquariums for salt-water plants and animals\r\nhave been proposed on a great scale. That of the Zoological Gardens of\r\nParis, in the Bois de Boulogne, inaugurated in 1861, is perhaps the\r\nlargest in the world. It is a solid stone building of fifty yards in\r\nlength by about twelve broad, presenting a range of forty reservoirs of\r\nAngers slate, running north and south. The reservoirs are nearly\r\ncubical, presenting in front the strong glass of Saint Gobain, which\r\npermits of the interior being seen. They are lighted from above; but the\r\nlight is weak, greenish, uniform, and consequently mysterious and\r\ngloomy, giving a pretty exact imitation of the submarine light some\r\nfathoms down. Each reservoir contains about two hundred gallons of\r\nwater. It is furnished with rocks disposed a little in the form of an\r\namphitheatre, and in a picturesque manner. Upon the rocks various\r\nspecies of marine vegetables are planted. The bottom is of shingle,\r\ngravel, and sand, in order to give certain animals a sufficiently\r\nnatural retreat.\r\n\r\nTen of these reservoirs are intended for marine animals. The water\r\nemployed is never changed, but it is kept in continual agitation by\r\ncirculation, produced by a current of water led from the great pipe\r\nwhich feeds the Bois de Boulogne. This water, being subjected to a\r\nstrong pressure, compresses a certain portion of air, which, being\r\npermitted to act on a portion of the sea water contained in a closed\r\ncylinder placed below the level of the aquarium, makes it ascend, and\r\nenter with great force into a reservoir, into which it is thrown from a\r\nsmall jet. The sea water thus pressed absorbs a portion of the air,\r\nwhich is drawn with it into the reservoir. A tube placed in a corner of\r\nthe reservoir receives the overflow, and conducts it into a closed\r\ncarbon filter, whence it passes into a gravelly underground reservoir,\r\nreturning again to the closed cylinder. The water is once more subjected\r\nto the pressure of air, and again ascends to the aquarium. The cylinder\r\nbeing underground, a temperature equal to about sixteen degrees Cent.,\r\nwhich is nearly the uniform temperature of the ocean, is easily\r\nmaintained. During winter, the aquarium is heated artificially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nZOOPHYTES.\r\n\r\n    \"Nature is nowhere more perfect than in her smaller works.\"\r\n    \"Natura nusquam magis quàm in minimis tota est.\"\r\n\r\n    PLINY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will not be out of place here to offer some remarks on animals in\r\ngeneral, including the whole kingdom as well as the great divisions\r\nwhich form the subject of this particular volume. But considering the\r\nvastness of the subject, and our imperfect knowledge of the whole animal\r\nseries as a subject of study, nothing is more difficult than to seize\r\nupon the real analogies between beings of types so varied,--of\r\norganizations so dissimilar. The arrangements which naturalists have\r\nestablished in order to study and describe animals--the divisions,\r\nclasses, orders, families, genera, and species--are admirable\r\ncontrivances for facilitating the study of creatures numerous as the\r\nsands of the sea shore. Without this precious means of logical\r\ndistribution, the individual mind would recoil before the task of\r\ndescribing the innumerable phalanges of contemporary animal life. But\r\nthe reader must never forget that these methodical divisions are pure\r\nfictions, due to human invention: they form no part of nature; for has\r\nnot Linnæus told us that nature makes no leaps, _natura non facit\r\nsaltus_? Nature passes in a manner almost insensibly from one stage of\r\norganization to another, altogether irrespective of human systems.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when we come to watch the confines of the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdom, we realise how difficult it is to seize the precise line of\r\ndemarcation which separates the great kingdoms of Nature. We have seen\r\nin the \"Vegetable World\" germs of the simplest organization, as in the\r\nCryptogamia, spores, as in the Algæ, and fruitful corpuscles, as in the\r\nMosses, which seem to be invested with some of the characteristics of\r\nanimal life, for they appear to be gifted with organs of locomotion,\r\nnamely, vibratile cilia, by means of which they execute movements which\r\nare to all appearance quite voluntary. Side by side with these are\r\nvegetable germs and fecundating corpuscles, known as _antherozoides_\r\namong the Algæ, Mosses, and Ferns, which, when floating in water, go and\r\ncome like the inferior animals, seeking to penetrate into cavities,\r\nwithdrawing themselves, returning again, and again introducing\r\nthemselves, and exhibiting all the signs of an apparent effort. Let us\r\ncompare the Infusoria, or even the Polypi and Gorgons, with these\r\nshifting vegetable organisms, and say if it is easy to determine,\r\nwithout considerable study, which is the plant and which the animal. The\r\nprecise line of demarcation which it is so desirable to establish\r\nbetween the two kingdoms of Nature is indeed difficult to trace.\r\n\r\nThe word _zoophyte_, to which this comparison introduces us, seems very\r\nhappily applied: it is derived from the Greek word ζῶον, animal, and\r\nφυτὸν, _plant_; and is, as it seems to us, quite worthy of being\r\nretained in Science, because it consecrates and materialises, so to\r\nspeak, a sort of fusion between the two kingdoms of Nature at their\r\nconfines. Let us guard ourselves, however, from carrying this idea too\r\nfar, and, upon the faith of a happy word, altering altogether the true\r\nrelations of created beings. In adopting the name _zoophyte_, to\r\nindicate a great division of the animal kingdom, the reader must not\r\nimagine that there is any ambiguity about the creatures designated, or\r\nthat they belong at once to both kingdoms, or that they might be ranged\r\nindifferently in the one or the other. Zoophytes are animals, and\r\nnothing but animals; the justification for using a designation which\r\nsignifies animal-plant is, that many of them have an exterior\r\nresemblance to plants; that they divide themselves by offshoots, as some\r\nplants do, and are sometimes crowned with organs tinted with lively\r\ncolours, like some flowers.\r\n\r\nThis analogy between plants and zoophytes is nowhere more apparent than\r\nin the coral. Rooted in the soil and upon rocks, the form of its\r\nbranches many times subdivided, above all, the coloured appendages which\r\nat certain periods so closely resemble the corolla of a flower, have all\r\nthe form and appearance of plants. Until the eighteenth century most\r\nnaturalists classed the coral as Linnæus did, without the least\r\nhesitation, with analogous creations in the vegetable world. Réaumur\r\nlong contended for the contrary opinion; but it is only in our day that\r\nthe animal nature of the coral is satisfactorily established. The _sea\r\nanemone_ may be cited as another striking example of the resemblance\r\nborne by certain inferior organisms to vegetables. We hold, then, that\r\nwe are justified in using the word _zoophyte_ to designate the beings\r\nwhich now occupy our attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall not surprise our readers by telling them that the structure of\r\nthe zoophyte, especially in its inferior orders, is excessively simple.\r\nThey are the first steps in the scale of animal life, and in them a\r\npurely rudimentary organization was to be expected. In these\r\nbeings--true types of animal life--the several parts of the body, in\r\nplace of being disposed in pairs on each side of its longitudinal plane,\r\nas occurs in animals of a higher organization, are found to radiate\r\nhabitually round an axis or central point, and this whether in its adult\r\nor juvenile state. Zoophytes have not generally an articulate skeleton,\r\neither exterior or interior, and their nervous system, where it exists,\r\nis very slightly developed. The organs of the senses, other than those\r\nof touch, are altogether absent in the greater part of beings which\r\nbelong to this, the lowest class of the last division of the animal\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nSeveral questions arise here: Has the zoophyte sentiment, feeling,\r\nperception? Has it consciousness, sense, sensibility? The question is\r\ninsoluble; it is an abyss of obscurity. The coral, or rather the\r\naggregation of living beings which bear the name, are attached to the\r\nrock which has seen their birth, and which will witness their death: the\r\ninfusoria, of microscopic dimensions, which revolve perpetually in a\r\ncircle infinitesimally small; the Amoebæ, the marvellous Proteus, which\r\nin the space of a minute changes its form a hundred times under the\r\nsurprised eyes of the observer, are, in truth, mere atoms charged with\r\nlife. Yet all these beings have an existence to appearance purely\r\nvegetative. In their obscure and blind impulse, have they consciousness\r\nor instinct? Do they know what takes place at the three-thousandth part\r\nof an inch from their microscopic bodies? To the Creator alone does the\r\nknowledge of this mystery belong.\r\n\r\nIt would be foreign to the object of this work to enter into minute\r\ndivision of the innumerable creatures which swarm on the ocean and on\r\nits confines. We shall perhaps best consult the convenience of our\r\nreaders by adopting the following simple arrangement of these animals\r\ninto\r\n\r\nI. PROTOZOA, including the _Spongiadæ_, _Infusoria_, and _Foraminifera_.\r\n\r\nII. POLYPIFERA, including the _Hydræ_, _Sertularia_, and _Pennatulariæ_.\r\n\r\nIII. ECHINODERMATA, or Sea-urchins and Star-fishes.\r\n\r\nOur space will prevent our doing more than presenting to the reader in\r\nsuccession the most characteristic types of each of these groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE PROTOZOA.\r\n\r\nThe Protozoares represent animal life reduced to its most simple\r\nexpression. They are organized atoms, mere animated and moving points,\r\nliving sparks. As they are the simplest forms of animal life as regards\r\ntheir structure, so also they are the smallest. Their microscopic\r\ndimensions hide them from our view. The discovery of the microscope was\r\na necessary step to our becoming acquainted with these beings, whose\r\nexistence was ignored by the ancient world, and only revealed in the\r\nseventeenth century by the discovery of the microscope. When armed with\r\nthis marvellous instrument, applied to examine the various liquid\r\nmediums--as when Leuwenhoek, for example, applied the magnifying glass\r\nto the inspection of stagnant water, with its infusions of macerated\r\nvegetable and animal substances--when he scrutinized a drop of water\r\nborrowed from the ocean, from rivers, or from lakes, he discovered there\r\na new world--a world which will be unveiled in these pages.\r\n\r\nSome modern writers believe that the Protozoa is a mere _cellular\r\norganism_, that being the principle and end of organization, such as we\r\nfind it in the cellular vegetable. According to this hypothesis, the\r\nProtozoares would be the cellulars of the animal kingdom, as the Algæ\r\nand Mushrooms are of the vegetable world. This idea is so far wrong,\r\nthat it has been founded upon the empire of pure theory. \"In reality,\"\r\nsays Paul Gervais and Van Beneden, \"the animals to which we extend it\r\nvery rarely resemble elementary cellulars.\" The tissue of which the\r\nbodies of the Protozoa are composed is habitually destitute of cellular\r\nstructure. They are formed of a sort of animated jelly, amorphous and\r\ndiaphanous, and have received from Dujardin the name of _Sarcoda_, or\r\nsoft-fleshed animals.\r\n\r\nInfinitely varied in their form, the Protozoares are furnished with\r\n_vibratile cilia_, which are organs of locomotion belonging to the lower\r\nanimals inhabiting the liquid element. Their bodies are sometimes naked,\r\nsometimes covered with a siliceous, chalky, or membranous cuirass. They\r\nare divided into two great classes, the _Rhizopoda_ and _Infusoria_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPONGIA.\r\n\r\nThe Sponge is a natural production, which has been known from times of\r\nthe highest antiquity. Aristotle, Pliny, and all other writers who\r\noccupied themselves with natural history in ancient times, are agreed in\r\naccording to it a sensitive life. They recognize the curious fact that\r\nthe sponge evades the hand which tries to seize it, and clings to the\r\nrocks on which it is rooted, as if it would resist the efforts made to\r\ndetach it. Pliny, Dioscorides, and their commentators, even formed the\r\nidea that sponges were capable of feeling, that they adhered to their\r\nnative rock by special force, and that they shrunk from the hand which\r\ntried to seize them. They even distinguished males from females.\r\nErasmus, however, criticising Pliny, concludes that he may pass over all\r\nhe has written upon the sponge. The sponge, in short, was to the\r\nancients something between a plant and an animal.\r\n\r\nRondelet, the friend of the celebrated Rabelais, whom the merry curate\r\nof Meudon designated under the name of _Rondibilis_, who was himself a\r\nphysician and naturalist of Montpellier, denied at first the existence\r\nof sensibility in sponges. He originated the idea that these productions\r\nbelonged to the vegetable world--an idea which Tournefort, Gaspard\r\nBauhin, Rey, and even Linnæus, in the first editions of his \"Systema\r\nNaturæ,\" supported by the great authority of their names. Afterwards,\r\ninfluenced by the convincing labours of Trembley and some other\r\nobservers, Linnæus withdrew the sponges from the vegetable world. He\r\nsatisfied himself, in short, that certain polypiers much resembled\r\nsponges in the nature of their parenchyma, and that, on the other hand,\r\nthe assimilation of sponges with plants was not such as could be\r\nmaintained. Neuremberg, Peyssonnel, and Trembley maintain the animal\r\nnature of sponges, and their views are adopted by Linnæus, Guettard,\r\nDonati, Lamouroux, and Ehrenberg on the Continent, and by Ellis,\r\nFleming, and Grant in England. They live at the bottom of the seas in\r\nfive to twenty-five fathoms of water, among the clefts and crevices of\r\nthe rocks, always adhering and attaching themselves, not only to\r\ninorganic bodies, but even growing on vegetables and animals, spreading,\r\nerect, or pendent, according to the body which supports them and their\r\nnatural habit.\r\n\r\nThe power of fixing themselves to other objects, which certain animals\r\npossess, is very singular. Nevertheless, it is certain that whole tribes\r\nexist consisting of innumerable strictly adherent species, which live\r\nand die attached to some rock or other object; and among these are all\r\npolypiers, such as the sponges and corallines. It follows that they are\r\nwholly dependent on external agencies for their means of existence. \"The\r\npoor little creatures,\" says Alfred Frédol, \"receive their nourishment\r\nfrom the wave which washes past them; they inhale and respire the bitter\r\nwater all their lives; they are insensible to that which is only the\r\nhundredth part of an inch from their mouth.\"\r\n\r\nIn the months of April and May, these animalcules engender germs, round,\r\nyellow, or white, whence proceed certain ovoid granular embryos\r\nfurnished towards their largest extremity with small vibratile cilia.\r\nThey are thrown off by the currents, which serve as a stomach, and form\r\nswarms of larvæ round the polypier. They swim about with a gliding wavy\r\nmotion, and when they have been some time in the water they usually come\r\nto the surface; but they are also often carried off by the current.\r\nDuring two or three days they seem to seek a convenient place to fix\r\nthemselves. Once fixed, the larvæ loses the cilia, spreads itself out,\r\nand takes the form of a flattened gelatinous disk.\r\n\r\nIts interior organization consists of contractile cellules and numerous\r\nspiculæ--\"a tribe,\" says Gosse, \"of the most debateable forms of life,\r\nlong denied a right to stand in the animal ranks at all, and even still\r\nadmitted there doubtingly and grudgingly by some excellent naturalists.\r\nYet such they certainly are, established beyond reasonable controversy\r\nas true and proper examples of animal life.\"\r\n\r\nIt may, then, be safely asserted that all naturalists are now satisfied\r\nof the animal nature of sponges, although they represent the lowest and\r\nmost obscure grade of animal existence, and that so close to the\r\nconfines of the vegetable world, that it is difficult in some species to\r\ndetermine whether they are on the one side or the other. \"Several of\r\nthem, however,\" says Mr. Gosse, \"if viewed with a lens under water while\r\nin a living state, display vigorous currents constantly pouring forth\r\nfrom certain orifices; and we necessarily infer that the water thus\r\nejected must be constantly taken in through some other channel. On\r\ntearing the mass open, we see that the whole substance is perforated in\r\nall directions by irregular canals, leading into each other, of which\r\nsome are slender, and communicate with the surface by minute but\r\nnumerous pores, and others are wide, and open by ample orifices; through\r\nthe former the water is admitted, through the latter it is ejected.\" It\r\nis not to be denied, however, that these beings constitute, in spite of\r\ninvestigations of modern naturalists, a group still somewhat\r\nproblematical, and still very imperfectly known as regards their\r\ninternal organization.\r\n\r\nSponges are masses of a light elastic tissue, which is, at the same\r\ntime, resistant, full of air-cells, and with much varied exterior\r\narrangements. Nearly three hundred species are known, the different\r\nappearances of which have been characterised by names more or less\r\nsingular. There is, for instance, the Feather Sponge, the Fan Sponge,\r\nthe Bell, the Lyre, the Trumpet, the Distaff, the Peacock Tail, and\r\nNeptune's Glove.\r\n\r\nThere are river sponges and sea sponges.\r\n\r\nThe first are irregular and arenaceous masses, which pile themselves\r\nupon plants and solid bodies immerged in fresh water. Such are the\r\n_spongilles_, upon which anatomic and embryonic observations have very\r\nfrequently been made in relation to the group more immediately under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe second is found in almost every sea; especially are they found in\r\nthe Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Mexican Gulf. Affecting warm and\r\nquiet waters, they attach themselves to bold and rugged rocks at depths\r\nranging from five to twenty-five fathoms. They are erect, pendent, or\r\nspreading, according to their form or position. Fig. 10, drawn from\r\nNature, represents a very remarkable form of sponge, which was fished up\r\nin sixty fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe sponge is very common in the Mediterranean and round the Grecian\r\nArchipelago, and is known vulgarly under the name of the Marine\r\nMushroom, the Sailor's Nest, and the fine soft sponge of Syria. It is a\r\nmass more or less rounded, covered with a mucous bed, glutinous above,\r\nformed of a light elastic but resisting tissue full of gaps, and\r\nriddled with air-cells. This tissue is formed of delicate flexible\r\nfibres, uniting in all directions by anastomosis, but presenting\r\nnumerous pores, which are formed by what is termed osculation, having\r\nirregular _conduits_ which connect them. In this tissue certain very\r\nsmall solid bodies are discovered, named _spiculæ_. The _spiculæ_ are\r\nsiliceous or calcareous in their nature, varying according to the\r\nspecies, and sometimes varying even in the same species. Some of these\r\nresemble needles, others are pin-like, and others again resemble very\r\nsmall stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Spongia, half the natural size, attached to its\r\nrocky bed.]\r\n\r\nThe physiological function of those tubes and orifices which present\r\nthemselves on all parts of the sponge has been interpreted in various\r\nways. Ellis, writing in 1765, supposes that they were the orifices of\r\nthe cells occupied by the polypi. In 1816, Lamarck still advocated this\r\nopinion; and even now we find the observer, whose notes M. Frédol has\r\nedited with so much judgment, asserting that \"the inhabitants of the\r\nsponge are a species of fleeting, transparent, gelatinous tube,\r\nsusceptible of extension and contraction; young polypes, as we may call\r\nthem, without consistence, without cilia; incipient polypes, in short,\r\nof very simple but sufficient organization. The animalcule of the sponge\r\nis a stomach, without arms, very simple, very elementary--in short, an\r\nanimal all stomach!\"\r\n\r\nThis mode of considering the sponge is not conformable to the views of\r\nthe leaders of modern science, however. Mr. Milne Edwards, for instance,\r\nin place of seeing in the sponge a collection of united beings, forming\r\nas it were a colony, considers each to be an isolated being, an unique\r\nindividual. The innumerable canals by which the sponge is traversed,\r\naccording to that author, are at once the digestive organs and breathing\r\npores of the zoophyte. The vibratile cilia are necessary to the renewed\r\naeration of the water required as a respiratory fluid in the interior\r\ncanals of the sponge. The currents in these channels have one constant\r\ndirection. The water penetrates the sponge by numerous orifices of\r\nminute dimensions and irregular disposition; it traverses channels in\r\nthe body of the zoophyte, which reunite somewhat like the root of a\r\nplant, in order to constitute the trunk and increase its substance;\r\nfinally, the water makes its escape by special openings. According to\r\nthis view, the channels of the sponge have a kind of cumulative\r\nphysiology, performing the two functions of digestion and respiration.\r\nThe rapid currents of aerated water which traverse them lead into them\r\nthe substances necessary to the nourishment of these strange creatures,\r\nrejecting all excremental matter. At the same time, the walls of these\r\ncanals present a large absorbing surface which separates the oxygen with\r\nwhich the water is charged, and disengages the carbonic acid which\r\nresults from respiration.\r\n\r\nSponges contain true eggs, from which embryo polyps are produced; these\r\nhave not cilia at first. In the interior of these eggs the contractile\r\ncellules have their birth; then the spiculæ; and when they are finally\r\ncovered with the vibratile cilia, aided by them these larvæ of ovoid\r\nform swim, or rather glide, through the water. The species of infusoria\r\nborn of the sponge resemble the larvæ of various polypes at the moment\r\nthey issue from the egg. \"They soon attach themselves to some foreign\r\nbody,\" says Mr. Milne Edwards, \"and become henceforth immovable; no\r\nlonger giving signs either of sensibility or of contractibility, while\r\nin their enlargement they are completely transformed. The gelatinous\r\nsubstance of their bodies is channeled and riddled with holes--the\r\nfibrous framework is completed--the sponge is formed.\"\r\n\r\nWe may add, however, that other zoologists, and among them MM. Paul\r\nGervais and Van Beneden, take a different view of the development of the\r\nsponges, and Dr. Johnston omits them altogether from his great work on\r\n\"British Zoophytes.\" \"If they are not the production of polypi,\" he\r\nsays, \"the zoologist who retains them in his province must contend that\r\nthey are individually animals, an opinion to which I cannot assent,\r\nseeing that they have no animal structure or individual organs, and\r\nexhibit not one function usually supposed to be characteristic of the\r\nanimal kingdom.\" Gervais and Van Beneden consider, as Milne Edwards\r\ndoes, that the embryos are at first movable, then fixed, many of them\r\nuniting together, and melting, as it were, into one common colony, which\r\nbecome a sponge, such as we see it. An isolated embryo might also, by\r\nthrowing out germs, produce a similar colony, which would thus become a\r\nproduct of agamous generation. Thus it appears that Science is far from\r\nbeing settled in its views as to the organization and development of\r\nthese obscure and complex formations; nor is it more advanced in its\r\nknowledge of the duration of life and the quickness of growth in\r\nsponges. It is agreed, however, on one point--namely, that the\r\nsponge-fisher may return to the same fishing-ground after three years\r\nfrom the last fishing. At the present time sponge-fishing takes place\r\nprincipally in the Grecian Archipelago and the Syrian _littoral_. The\r\nGreeks and Syrians sell the product of their fishing to the Western\r\nnations, and the trade has been immensely extended in recent times, when\r\nthe sponge has become an almost necessary adjunct of the toilet as well\r\nas the stable, and in other cleansing operations.\r\n\r\nFishing usually commences towards the beginning of June on the coast of\r\nSyria, and finishes at the end of October. But the months of July and\r\nAugust are peculiarly favourable to the sponge harvest, if we may use\r\nthe term. Latakia furnishes about ten boats to the fishery, Batroun\r\ntwenty, Tripoli twenty-five to thirty, Kalki fifty, Simi about a hundred\r\nand seventy to a hundred and eighty, and Kalminos more than two hundred.\r\nThe operations of one of these boats fishing for sponges on the Syrian\r\ncoast is represented in Plate II.\r\n\r\nThe boat's crew consists of four or five men, who scatter themselves\r\nalong the coast for two or three miles in search of sponges under the\r\ncliffs and ledges of rock. Sponges of inferior quality are gathered in\r\nshallow waters. The finer kinds are found only at a depth of from twelve\r\nto twenty fathoms. The first are fished for with three-toothed harpoons,\r\nby the aid of which they are torn from their native rock; but not\r\nwithout deteriorating them more or less. The finer kinds of sponges, on\r\nthe other hand, are collected by divers aided by a knife; they are\r\ncarefully detached. Thus the price of a sponge brought up by diving is\r\nmuch more considerable than that of a harpooned sponge. Among divers,\r\nthose of Kalminos and of Psara are particularly renowned. They will\r\ndescend to the depth of twenty-five fathoms, remain down a shorter time\r\nthan the Syrian divers, and yet bring up a more abundant harvest. The\r\nfishing of the Archipelago furnishes few fine sponges to commerce, but a\r\ngreat quantity of very common ones. The Syrian fisheries furnish many of\r\nthe finer kinds, which find a ready market in France; they are of medium\r\nsize. On the other hand, those which are furnished from the Barbary\r\ncoast are of great dimensions, of a very fine tissue, and much sought\r\nfor in England. On the Bahama banks, and in the Gulf of Mexico, the\r\nsponges grow in water of small depth. The fishermen, Spanish, American,\r\nand English, sink a long mast or perch into the water moored near the\r\nboat, down which they drop upon the sponges; by this means they are\r\neasily gathered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate II.--Sponge Fishing on the Coast of Syria.]\r\n\r\nIn the Red Sea, the Arabs fish for sponges by diving, their produce\r\nbeing either sold to the English at Aden or sent to Egypt.\r\nSponge-fishing is carried on at various other stations in the\r\nMediterranean, but without any intelligent direction, and in consequence\r\nit is effected without any conservative foresight. At the same time,\r\nhowever, the trade in this product goes on increasing. But it is only\r\na question of time when the trade shall cease; the demand which every\r\nyear clears the submarine fields of these zoophytes causes such\r\ndestruction that their reproduction will soon cease to be equal to the\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent this troublesome result, it is very desirable that\r\nthe several species of sponges should be naturalized on the French and\r\nAlgerian coast, and the cultivation and reproduction of the zoophyte\r\nprotected. For this purpose, the rocky coasts of the Mediterranean, from\r\nCape Cruz to Nice, and round the islands of Corsica and Hyères, in the\r\nAlgerian waters, and even some of the salt lakes of the departments near\r\nthe Mediterranean, might be utilized. The whole of the Italian littoral\r\nwould also be available under the new régime for this purpose.\r\n\r\nM. Lamiral considered that the composition of the water of the\r\nMediterranean being thought the same on the coast of France, of Algeria,\r\nand on the Syrian coast, that the difference of temperature between the\r\ntwo latitudes--especially at the depth where the sponges flourish\r\nmost--would not interfere with the existence of these robust zoophytes,\r\nand that their acclimatization on the coasts of France and Algeria would\r\nbe a certain success. He remarked, moreover, that the more the sponges\r\nadvanced towards the north, the finer and compacter their tissues\r\nbecame; and he argued from this fact, that a considerable improvement in\r\nthe quality would result from the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty, then, would consist in the transplanting sponges\r\nfrom Syrian waters to the coasts of France and Algeria. A submarine\r\nboat, such as M. Lamiral makes use of for operations conducted in deep\r\nwater, would, according to this naturalist, give every facility for\r\ncollecting sponges for the purpose. This boat can descend to great\r\ndepths, and its crew can dwell there a considerable time, for it is\r\ncontinually fed with fresh air from above, which is conveyed by an\r\nair-pump and tube into the interior of the boat, so that the men could\r\nreadily select such individuals as were suited for acclimatizing;\r\nremoving the blocks of rock along with them, either by placing them in\r\ncases pierced with holes, or by towing them to their new abode.\r\nEverything seems to promise that in the following year the zoophytes\r\nwould begin to multiply in their new country.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ might also be collected in the months of April and May, as\r\nthey separate from the parent sponge, and be transplanted to favourable\r\nlocalities. At the end of three years, when these true submarine fields\r\nwould be ripe for harvesting, they could be put in train for methodical\r\ncollection by means of diving boats.\r\n\r\nThe toilet sponge is an article which produces a high price, often as\r\nmuch as forty shillings the pound for very choice specimens, a price\r\nwhich few commercial products attain, which prohibits its use, in short,\r\nto all but the wealthy. It is, therefore, very desirable to carry out\r\nthe submarine enterprise of M. Lamiral. With the assistance of the\r\nAcclimatization Society of Paris, some experiments have already been\r\nmade in this direction--so far without any satisfactory results, it is\r\ntrue, but everything indicates that by perseverance we shall see the\r\nenterprise crowned by the success it merits.\r\n\r\nSuch specimens as now reach our ports are chiefly distinguished by their\r\nappearance, quality, and origin.\r\n\r\nThe fine soft Syrian sponge is distinguished by its lightness, its fine\r\nflaxen colour, its form, which is that of a cup, its surface convex,\r\nvoluted, pierced with innumerable small orifices, the concave part of\r\nwhich presents canals of much greater diameter, which are prolonged to\r\nthe exterior surface in such a manner that the summit is nearly always\r\npierced throughout in many places. This sponge is sometimes blanched by\r\nthe aid of caustic substances, acids, or alkalies; but this preparation\r\nshortens its duration and changes its colour. This sponge is specially\r\nemployed for the toilet, and its price is high. Those which are\r\nround-shaped, large, and soft, sometimes produce as much as five or six\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe _Fine Sponge of the Archipelago_ is scarcely distinguishable from\r\nthat of Syria, either before or after being cleansed; nevertheless, it\r\nis weightier, its texture is not so fine, and the holes with which it is\r\npierced are at once larger and less in number. It is nearly of the same\r\ncountry as the former, in fact, the fishing extending along the Syrian\r\ncoast as well as the littoral of Barbary and the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe _Fine Hard Sponge_, called Greek, is less sought for than either of\r\nthe preceding; it is useful for domestic and for certain industrial\r\npurposes. Its mass is irregular, its colour fauve; it is hard and\r\ncompact, and pierced with small holes.\r\n\r\nThe _White Sponge of Syria_, called Venetian, is esteemed for its\r\nlightness, the regularity of its form, and its solidity. In its rough\r\nstate it is brown in colour, of a fine texture, compact and firm.\r\nPurified, it becomes flaxen and of a looser texture. The orifice of the\r\ngreat channels which traverse it are edged with rough and bristly hairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (From Dr. Grant.)\r\n\r\nFig. 11. _Spongia oculata_, showing the orifices and currents outwards.\r\n2. Anastomosing horny substance of _Spongia communis_. 3. Siliceous\r\nspiculum of _S. papillaris_. 4. Of _S. cineria_. 5. _S. panicea_. 6.\r\nCalcareous spiculum of _S. compressa_. 7.

Young _Spongia papillaris_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Brown Barbary Sponge_, called the Marseillaise, when first taken\r\nout of the water, presents itself as an elongated flattened body,\r\ngelatinous, round in shape, and charged with blackish mud. It is then\r\nhard, heavy, coarse, but compact, and of a reddish colour. By a simple\r\nwashing in water it becomes round, still remaining heavy and reddish. It\r\npresents many gaps, the intervals of which are occupied by a sinuous and\r\ntenacious network. It is valuable for domestic use, because of the\r\nfacility with which it absorbs water, and its great strength.\r\n\r\nOther sorts of sponges are very abundant. The _Blonde Sponge_ of the\r\nArchipelago, often confounded with the Venetian; the _Hard Barbary\r\nSponge_, called Gelina, which only comes by accident into France; the\r\n_Salonica Sponge_ is of middling quality; finally, the _Bahama Sponge_,\r\nfrom the Antilles, is wanting in flexibility and a little hard, and so\r\nis sold at a low price, having few useful properties to recommend it.\r\n\r\nMany species of _Spongia_ are described as inhabiting British seas, but\r\nnone of any commercial value. Regarding them as apolypiferous zoophytes,\r\nDr. Grant has pointed out certain principles of analysis on which they\r\nmay be grouped, according to the arrangement of the horny fibres, the\r\ncalcareous and siliceous spiculæ, and the distribution and formation of\r\ntheir pores and orifices.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. GROUPS OF WHICH THE CONSTITUENT STRUCTURE IS KNOWN.\r\n\r\n_Spongia._--Mass soft, elastic, more or less irregular in shape, very\r\nporous, traversed by many tortuous canals, which terminate at the\r\nsurface in distinct orifices. Substance of the skeleton cartilaginous,\r\nfibres anastomosed in all directions, without any earthy\r\nspicula.--Example, _S. communis_ (Fig. 11 [2]).\r\n\r\n_Calcispongia_ (Blainville).--Mass rigid or slightly elastic, of\r\nirregular form, porous, traversed by irregular canals, which terminate\r\non the surface in distinct orifices; skeleton cartilaginous, fibres\r\nstrengthened by calcareous spicula, often tri-radiate.--Example, _S.\r\ncompressa_ (Fig. 11 [6]).\r\n\r\n_Halispongia_ (Blainville).--Mass more or less rigid or friable,\r\nirregular, porous, traversed by tortuous irregular canals, which\r\nterminate at the surface in distinct orifices; substance cartilaginous,\r\nfibres strengthened by siliceous spicula, generally fusiform or\r\ncylindrical.--Example, _S. papillaris_ (Grant) (Fig. 11 [3]).\r\n\r\n_Spongilla_ (Lamarck).--Mass more or less rigid or friable, irregular,\r\nporous, but not furnished with regular orifices or internal\r\ncanals.--Example, _S. fluviatalis_ (Linn.).\r\n\r\n\r\nII. GROUPS DEPENDING ON CHARACTERS OF SURFACE OR GENERAL FIGURE.\r\n\r\n_Geodia_ (Lamarck).--Fleshy mass, tuberous, irregular, hollow within,\r\nexternally incrusted by a porous envelope, which bears a series of\r\norifices in a small tubercular space.--Example, _G. gibberosa_\r\n(Schmeiger).\r\n\r\n_Coeloptychium_ (Goldfuss).--Mass fixed, pedicled, the upper part\r\nexpanded, agariciform, concave, and radiato-porose above, flat and\r\nradiato-sulcate below; substance fibrous.--Example, _C. agarisidioideum_\r\n(Goldfuss). Fossils from the chalk of Westphalia.\r\n\r\n_Siphonia_ (Parkinson).--Mass polymorphous, free or fixed, ramose or\r\nsimple, concave or fistulous above, porous at the surface, and\r\npenetrated by anastomosing canals, which terminate in sub-radiating\r\norifices within the cup.\r\n\r\n_Myrmecium_ (Goldfuss).--Mass sub-globular, sessile, of a close fibrous\r\ntexture, forming ramified canals which radiate from the base to the\r\ncircumference. Summit with a central pit.\r\n\r\n_Scyphia_ (Oken).--Mass cylindrical, simple, or branched, fistulous,\r\nending in a large rounded pit, and composed entirely of a reticulated\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\n_Eudea_ (Lamouroux).--Mass filiform, attenuated, sub-pedicellate at one\r\nend, enlarged and rounded at the other, with a large terminal pit;\r\nsurface reticulated by irregular lacunæ, minutely porous.\r\n\r\n_Halirrhoa_ (Lamouroux).--Mass turbinated, nearly regular, circular, or\r\nlobate; surface porous; a large central pit on the upper face.\r\n\r\n_Happalimus_ (Lamouroux).--Mass fungiform, pedicellate below, expanding\r\nconically, with a central pit above; surface porous and irregularly\r\nexcavated.\r\n\r\n_Cnemidium_ (Goldfuss).--Mass turbinate, sessile, composed of close\r\nfibres and horizontal canals, diverging from the centre to the\r\ncircumference; a central pit on the upper surface, cariose in the\r\nexterior and radiate at the margin.\r\n\r\n_Ierea_ (Lamouroux).--Mass ovoid, sub-pedicellate, finely porous;\r\npierced on the upper part by many orifices, the terminations of the\r\ninternal tubes.\r\n\r\n_Tethium_ (Lamarck).--Mass sub-globose, tuberose, composed of a cariose\r\nfirm substance, strengthened by abundance of siliciary spicula,\r\nfasciculated, and diverging from the centre to the circumference.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHIZOPODA.\r\n\r\nGervais and Van Beneden include under the name of _Rhizopods_, or\r\n_foot-rooted_ animals (so called from ριξα,, _root_; πους,\r\nποδος, _footed animals_), those of the simplest organization, which\r\nmay be characterised by the absence of distinct digestive cavities, and\r\nthe presence of vibratile cilia, as well as by the soft parts of their\r\ntissues. This tissue emits prolongations or filaments which admit of\r\neasy extension, sometimes simple, sometimes branching. Occasionally we\r\nsee these branching filaments withdraw themselves towards the mass of\r\nthe body, disappear, and gradually melt into its substance in such a\r\nmanner that the individual seems to absorb and devour itself. If, in\r\nexceptional cases, some of the superior animals, as the wolf, devour\r\neach other, the rhizopods go much farther: they devour themselves, so\r\nto speak!\r\n\r\nThe rhizopods are found both in fresh and salt water. They live, as\r\nparasites, on the body of worms and other articulated animals. The class\r\nis divided into many orders. We shall speak here only of three, namely,\r\nthe _Amoebæ_, _Foraminifera_, and _Noctiluca_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMOEBÆ.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all ancient animal and vegetable infusions, not quite\r\nputrid--upon all oozy beds covering bodies which have remained for some\r\ntime in fresh or sea water--we find the singular beings which belong to\r\nthis order. They are the simplest organisms in creation, being reduced\r\nto a mere drop of living matter. Their bodies are formed of a gelatinous\r\nsubstance, without appreciable organization. The quantity of matter\r\nwhich forms them is so infinitesimal, that it becomes incredibly\r\ndiaphanous, and so transparent that the eye, armed with the microscope,\r\ntraverses it in all directions, so that it is necessary to modify the\r\nnature of the liquid in which it is held in suspension, and introduce\r\nthe phenomenon of refraction in order to observe them.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to say exactly what is the form these creatures\r\nassume. They frequently have the appearance of small rounded masses,\r\nlike drops of water; but, whatever their form may be, it is always so\r\nunstable, that it changes, so to speak, every moment, so that it is\r\nfound impossible to make a drawing from the model under the\r\nmicroscope--the design must be finished by an appeal to memory. This\r\ninstability is the characteristic manifestation of life in the _Amoebæ_,\r\nwhich are naked beings, without apparent organization; in fact, they\r\noccupy the first step in the scale of creation.\r\n\r\nThe transparent immovable drop under consideration emits an expansion,\r\nand a lobe of a vitreous appearance upon its circumference, which,\r\ngliding like a drop of oil upon the object-glass of the microscope,\r\nbegins by fixing itself to it as a supporting point, afterwards slowly\r\nattracting to itself the whole mass, and thus gradually increasing its\r\nbulk under the observer's eye.\r\n\r\nThe _Amoebæ_, according to their dimensions and degree of development,\r\nsuccessively emit a greater or smaller number of lobes, none of which\r\nare precisely alike, but, after having appeared for an instant, each\r\nsuccessively re-enters into the common mass, with which it becomes\r\ncompletely incorporated. Variable in their respective forms, these lobes\r\npresent appearances quite different in the several genera. They are more\r\nor less lengthy, more or less fringed, and often branching; sometimes\r\nthey are filiform, sprouting in all directions over the animal mass,\r\nwhich rolls in the liquid like the husk of a small chestnut.\r\n\r\nIf we ask how these animals are nourished, in which no digestive\r\napparatus can be distinguished, the question is difficult to answer. It\r\nis thought that they are nourished by simple absorption, and by\r\nabsorption only. In the interior of the gelatinous mass which\r\nconstitutes the animals, however, granules and microscopic portions of\r\nvegetables are frequently discovered. \"We can conceive,\" says Dujardin,\r\n\"how these objects have penetrated to the interior, if we remark, on the\r\none hand, that in creeping on the surface of the glass, to which they\r\nadhere very exactly, the _Amœbæ_ can be made to receive, by pressure,\r\nforeign substances into their own bodies, by means of the alternate\r\ncontraction and extension of the various parts natural to them, and, on\r\nthe other hand, that the gelatinous mass is susceptible of spontaneous\r\ndepressions--here and there near to or even at the surface of the\r\nspherical cavities, which successively contract themselves and disappear\r\nin connection with the strange body which they have absorbed.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Amoebæ_ are often observed to be tinted red or green; this arises\r\nfrom the special colouring matter which has been absorbed into its mass.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, How do these creatures, so simple in their\r\norganization, propagate their species?\r\n\r\nWe believe that they are chiefly multiplied by parting with a lobe,\r\nwhich, in certain conditions, is enabled to live an independent\r\nexistence, and develop itself, thus forming a new individual. This is\r\nwhat naturalists term generation by division--_fissiparism_ or\r\n_fission_. The absence of a nutritive and reproductive apparatus in the\r\n_Amoebæ_, and the want of stability in their forms, explain how nearly\r\nimpossible it is to characterise as species the numerous individuals\r\ndaily met with in infusions of organic matter in stagnant water. In\r\norder to distinguish some of the groups, Dujardin bases his descriptions\r\nupon their size and the general form into which they expand.\r\n\r\nWe shall be able to form some idea of the appearance of these beings,\r\nrendered mysterious by their very simplicity, by throwing a glance upon\r\nthe two accompanying figures (Figs. 12 and 13), borrowed from the Atlas\r\nof Dujardin's great work, \"Les Zoophytes Infusoires,\" which we shall\r\nhave occasion to quote more than once.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the _Amœbæ_ change their form every few moments under\r\nthe eyes of the observer. Fig. 13 represents the changes of form through\r\nwhich they pass, according to Dujardin, when examined under the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Amoebæ princeps (Ehrenberg), magnified 100\r\ntimes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Various forms of Amoebæ diffluens (Müller),\r\nmagnified 400 times.]\r\n\r\nDujardin points out very clearly the identity of structure between\r\norganisms like _Amoebæ_ and such forms as _Difflugia_ and _Arcella_. All\r\nthese creatures are without trace of mouth or digestive cavity, and the\r\nentire body is a single cell, or aggregation of cells, which receive\r\ntheir nutriment by absorption; for, although the creatures have neither\r\nmouth nor stomach, yet, according to Professor Kölliker, they take in\r\nsolid nutriment, and reject what is indigestible. When in its progress\r\nthrough the water one of these minute organisms approaches one of the\r\nequally minute Algæ, from which it draws nourishment, it seizes the\r\nplant with its tentacular filaments, which it gradually encloses on all\r\nsides; the filaments, to all appearance, becoming more or less shortened\r\nin the process. In this way the captive is brought close to the surface\r\nof the body; a cavity is thus formed, in which the prey is lodged, which\r\ncloses round it on all sides. In this situation it is gradually drawn\r\ntowards the centre, and passes at last entirely into the mass. The\r\nengulfed morsel is gradually dissolved and digested.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORAMINIFERA.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing small in Nature. The idea of littleness or greatness is\r\na human conception--a comparison which is suggested by the dimensions of\r\nhis own organs. Nature, on the other hand, compensates smallness by\r\nnumbers. The result produced by the bones of some large animals is also\r\naccomplished by the accumulated spoils of millions of animalcules. The\r\nhistory of the Foraminifera is a striking example of this great truth.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is a Foraminifer? It is a very small zoophyte, a shell\r\nnearly invisible to the naked eye; for, in general, its dimensions\r\nrarely exceed the two hundredth part of an inch; in short, it is\r\nstrictly microscopic. Examine under a microscope the sand of the ocean,\r\nand it will be found that one-half of it consists of the débris of\r\nshells, of various but well-defined forms, each habitually pierced with\r\na number of holes. To this they are indebted for their name\r\nForaminifera, from _foramen_, a hole. With these microscopic animalcules\r\nNature has worked wonders in geological times; nor have the wonders\r\nceased in our days.\r\n\r\nMany beds of the terrestrial crust consist entirely of the remains of\r\nForaminifera. In the most remote ages in the history of our planet,\r\nthese zoophytes must have lived in innumerable swarms in the seas of the\r\nperiod; they buried themselves in the bottoms of the seas, and their\r\nshells, heaped up during many ages, have finished by forming hills of\r\ngreat thickness and extent. We may say, to give an example, that during\r\nthe Carboniferous period, a single species of these zoophytes has\r\nformed, in Russia alone, enormous beds of calcareous rock. Many beds of\r\ncretaceous formation are, in great part, composed of Foraminifera, and\r\nthey exist in immense numbers in the white chalk which covers and forms\r\nthe vast mountains ranging from Champagne, in France, nearly to the\r\ncentre of England.\r\n\r\nBut it is to the Tertiary formation that these zoophytes have\r\ncontributed the most enormous deposits. The greater part of the Egyptian\r\npyramids is only an aggregation of _Nummulites_ inserted in the syenite.\r\nA prodigious number of Foraminifera present themselves in the tertiary\r\ndeposits of the Gironde, of Italy, and of Austria. The chalk so abundant\r\nin the basin of Paris is almost entirely composed of Foraminifera. The\r\nremains of these creatures are so abundant in the Paris chalk, that M.\r\nd'Orbigny found upwards of fifty-eight thousand in a small block,\r\nscarcely exceeding a cubic inch of chalk, from the quarries of\r\nChantilly. This fact, according to this author, implies the existence of\r\nthree thousand millions of these zoophytes in the cubic mètre\r\n(thirty-nine inches square and a small fraction) of rock! As the chalk\r\nfrom these quarries has served to build Paris, as well as the towns and\r\nvillages of the neighbouring departments, it may be said that Paris, and\r\nother great centres of population which surround it, are built with the\r\nshells of these microscopic animals.\r\n\r\nThe sand of the littoral of all existing seas is so full of these minute\r\nbut elegant shells, that it is often half composed of them. Ehrenberg,\r\nthe celebrated German microscopist, was recently invited by the Prussian\r\ngovernment to assist in tracing the robbery of a special case of wine.\r\nIt had been repacked in littoral sand only found in an ancient sea-board\r\nin Germany. The criminal was thus detected. M. d'Orbigny found in three\r\ngrammes (forty-six grains troy) of sand from the Antilles, four hundred\r\nand forty thousand shells of Foraminifera. Bianchi found in thirty\r\ngrammes (four hundred and sixty-seven grains) from the Adriatic, six\r\nthousand of these shells. If we calculate the proportion of these beings\r\ncontained in a cubic mètre alone of sea-sand, we reach a figure which\r\npasses all conception. What would this be if we could extend the\r\ncalculation to the immensity of surface covered by the waves which\r\nsurround the globe?\r\n\r\nM. d'Orbigny has satisfied himself, by microscopic examination of sands\r\nfrom all parts of the globe, that it is the débris of Foraminifera which\r\nform, in all existing seas, those enormous deposits which raise banks,\r\nobstruct the navigation in gulfs and straits, and fill up ports, as may\r\nbe seen in the port of Alexandria. In common with the corals and\r\nmadrepores, the Foraminifera are the great agents in forming the isles\r\nwhich surge up under our eyes from the bosom of the ocean in the warmer\r\nregions of the globe. Thus shells, scarcely appreciable to the sight,\r\nsuffice by their accumulations to fill up seas, while performing a very\r\nconsiderable part in the great operations of Nature, although it may not\r\nbe apparent to us.\r\n\r\nOur exact knowledge of the Foraminifera is of very recent date. Great\r\nnumbers of minute particles, of regular and symmetrical form, were long\r\ndistinguished on the sands of the sea shore. These corpuscular atoms\r\nearly attracted the attention of observers. But with the discovery of\r\nthe microscope, these small elegant shells, which were among the\r\ncuriosities revealed by the instrument, assumed immense importance. We\r\nhave stated that these corpuscles are nothing but the shell or solid\r\nframework of a crowd of marine animalculæ: we may then consider them as\r\nliving species analogous to the Ammonites and Nautilus of geological\r\ntimes. Linnæus has placed them in this last genus, which would include,\r\naccording to that author, all the multilocular shells. In 1804, Lamarck\r\nclassed them among the molluscous cephalopods. But Alcide d'Orbigny, who\r\nhas devoted long years to study and observation, and may be considered\r\nthe great historian of the Foraminifera, makes it appear that this mode\r\nof classification was inexact. Dujardin separated them altogether from\r\nthe class of mollusks, and showed that they ought to be consigned to an\r\ninferior class of animals. These minute creatures, in short, are\r\ndeficient in the true appendages analogous to feet, which exist in the\r\nhigher mollusks. They simply possess filamentous expansions, very\r\nvariable in their form.\r\n\r\nWe have stated that the Foraminifera are of microscopic dimensions. With\r\nsome trifling exceptions, this is generally true; but there exist a\r\nnumber of species which are visible to the naked eye. The Foraminifers\r\nfound in the nummulite formation of Tremsted, in Bavaria, between Munich\r\nand Saltzberg, are still larger, being nearly double the size of the\r\nnummulite of the Pyramids; in short, they are the giants of this tribe\r\nof animals.\r\n\r\nAfter these remarks, we may venture to give some idea of the structure\r\nand classification of these beings, whose part in the work of creation\r\nhas, in former times, been so considerable.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the Foraminifera are formed of a gelatinous substance,\r\nsometimes entire and round, sometimes divided into segments, which can\r\nbe placed upon a line, simple or alternate, wound up into a spiral form\r\nor rolled round its axis, like a ball. A testaceous envelope, modelled\r\nupon the segments, follows the various modifications of form, and\r\nprotects the body in all its parts. From the extremity of the last\r\nsegment of one or many openings of the shell, or of the numerous pores,\r\nissue certain long and slender filaments, more or less numerous, which\r\nare divided and subdivided over their whole length, like the spreading\r\nbranches of a tree. They can attach themselves to external bodies with\r\nforce enough to determine the progression of the animal. Being formed of\r\ntransparent non-colouring matter, they may be said to be mere\r\nexpansions, which vary in form and length according to the conditions of\r\nthe ambient medium. The filaments have also very variable positions:\r\nsometimes they form an unique and retractile band, issuing from a single\r\nopening; sometimes they project themselves across from numerous little\r\npores in the shell, which covers the last segment of the animal. These\r\npores, or openings, give the name to the creatures under consideration.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the filaments, contractile and variable in their form,\r\nwhich constitute the feet and arms of these little creatures, appear to\r\nhave something electric in them: it is stated that the Infusoria are at\r\nonce paralysed in their motions when brought in contact with the minute\r\narms of the Foraminifera. \"It is probably by this means,\" says M.\r\nFrédol, \"that these creatures succeed in catching their prey. Is it not\r\nworthy of remark that these beings, however small their size and slight\r\ntheir form, are unpitying flesh-eaters? The smallest, the weakest, and\r\nthe most microscopic animal in existence thus becomes, by means of a\r\nhomœopathic dose of poison, a most formidable destroyer.\"\r\n\r\nAnother singular observation on these little filaments or arms we owe to\r\nDujardin. This naturalist observed that, when a _miliola_ attempted to\r\nclimb up the walls or sides of a vase, it could improvise, as it were,\r\non the instant, and at the expense of its own substance, a provisional\r\nfoot, which stretched itself out rapidly and performed all the functions\r\nof a permanent member. The occasion served, this temporary foot seemed\r\nonce more to return to the common mass, and was absorbed into the body.\r\nIt would thus appear that with these minute creatures the presence of a\r\nnecessity gives the power to create an organ by the mere will of the\r\ncreature, while man, with all his genius, cannot manufacture a hair. To\r\nthe present day, however, we have not been able to discover any organ of\r\nnutrition in the Foraminifera; they have no stomach, properly so called,\r\nbut Nature has gifted them with a peculiar tissue, at once gelatinous\r\nand contractile, and essentially simulative, which probably serves the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that the shells of these minute zoophytes vary much\r\nin form. They are generally many-chambered, each chamber communicating\r\nby pores in the walls; the different gelatinous parts of the animalcules\r\nare, in this manner, placed in continual communication with each other.\r\nAlcide d'Orbigny, to whom we owe almost all that is known of the class,\r\nhas distributed them into six families, making the form of the shell the\r\nbasis of their arrangement. These six families include sixty genera, and\r\nmore than sixteen hundred species, the families being as follows:--\r\n\r\nI. Monostega.--Animals consisting of a single segment. Shell of a single\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nII. Stichostega.--Animal in segments, arranged in a single line. Shell\r\nin chambers, superimposed linearly on a straight or curved axis.\r\n\r\nIII. Helicostega.--Animal in segments, spirally arranged. Chambers piled\r\nor superimposed on one axis, forming a spiral erection. In Fig. 21 we\r\nhave a horizontal section of _Faujasina_, in which the spiral\r\nconvolutions are visible on the truncated half of the shell.\r\n\r\nIV. Entomostega.--Animal composed of alternating segments forming a\r\nspiral. Chambers superimposed on two alternating axes, also forming a\r\nspiral.\r\n\r\nV. Enallostega.--Animal formed of alternate segments. Non-spiral\r\nchambers disposed alternately along two or three axes, also non-spiral.\r\n\r\nVI. Agathistega.--Animal formed of segments wound round an axis.\r\nChambers formed round a common axis, each investing half the\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of Foraminifera is illustrated by Fig. 14 (_Orbulina\r\nuniversa_), which is a small spherical shell, having a lateral aperture,\r\nthe interior of which has been occupied by the living jelly, to which\r\nthe shell owes its existence. In the second order, the shell (Fig. 15),\r\n_Dentalina communis_, advances beyond this simple type by a process of\r\nlinear budding, the first cell being spherical, with an opening through\r\nwhich a second segment is formed, generally a little larger than the\r\nfirst. This new growth is successively followed by others developed in\r\nthe same way, until the organism attains its maturity, when it exhibits\r\na series of cells arranged end on end, in a slightly curved line.\r\n\r\nIn the next group the gemmation takes a spiral bias, producing the\r\nnautilus shape which misled the earlier naturalists. In some cases all\r\nthe convolutions are visible, as in _Operculina_ (Fig. 16). In others,\r\nthe external convolute conceals those previously formed, as in\r\n_Nummulitis lenticularis_ (Fig. 17), _Cassidulina_ (Fig. 18),\r\n_Textilaria_ (Fig. 19), and _Alveolina oblonga_, d'Orbigny (Fig. 25),\r\nthe latter forming part of the eocene formation in the quartz and\r\ngreystone rocks of the neighbourhood of Paris; one figure representing\r\nthe shell entire, and the other a vertical section, while the small\r\nfigure between represents it in its natural size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Orbulina universa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Dentalina communis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Operculina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Nummulitis lenticularis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Cassidulina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Textilaria.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Spiroloculina.]\r\n\r\nIn the fourth group the shell is spiral, with the chamber equilateral,\r\nwith a larger and smaller side, the position being alternately reversed\r\nas the segments are multiplied, as in _Cassidulina_ (Fig. 18). In the\r\nsucceeding group the new segments are arranged alternately on opposite\r\nsides of the central line, as in _Textilaria_ (Fig. 19), thus forming\r\ntwo alternating non-spiral parallel segments, each connected by a single\r\norifice.\r\n\r\nThe sixth family differ entirely in appearance and structure from the\r\nother Foraminifera. They are more opaque than the other orders, having a\r\nresemblance to white porcelain, which presents a rich amber-brown hue\r\nwhen viewed by transmitted light. They are more or less oblong, each new\r\nsegment being nearly equal to the entire length of the shell, so that\r\nthe terminal orifice presents itself alternately at its opposite\r\nextremities, sometimes in one uniform plane, as in _Spiroloculina_ (Fig.\r\n20), and _Faujasina_ (Fig. 21). At other times each new segment, instead\r\nof being exactly opposite each other, is a little on one side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. Faujasina.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Williamson has shown that the shell enclosing each new segment\r\nis at first very thin; but as additional calcareous chambers are formed,\r\neach addition not only encases the new gemmation of the soft animal, but\r\nextends over all the exterior of the previously formed shell. The exact\r\nmanner in which this is accomplished is doubtful; but the Professor\r\nthinks it probable that the soft animal has the power of diffusing its\r\nsubstance over the shell, and thus depositing upon its surface\r\nadditional layers of calcareous matter.\r\n\r\nThe fossil Foraminifera are chiefly distinguished from recent and\r\nexisting species by the size of the former. While the living forms range\r\nfrom one-fourth to the one-hundredth part of an inch, the tertiary\r\nstrata abound in examples of _Nummulites_ varying from the eighth of an\r\ninch to the size of half-a-crown. The engraving is a drawing from\r\nNature, by MM. d'Archaic and Haime, of a piece of nummulitic rock, of\r\nNousse, in the Landes, in which a great variety of sizes and forms are\r\nexhibited.\r\n\r\nThe Nummulina belong to the third family, or Helicostega, in which the\r\nouter convolutions completely embrace the earlier-formed ones. Hence it\r\nis only by making microscopic sections, or thin slices, that their\r\nstructure can be fully seen. When such a section is carried horizontally\r\nthrough the centre of the shell, the segments present a spiral\r\narrangement, which, like the convolutions, are remarkable for their\r\nsmall size, and consequent great number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Nummulites Rouaulti (d'Archaic and J. Haime).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Siderolites calcitrapoides (Lamarck). Natural\r\nsize and magnified.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the distribution of the Foraminifera according to\r\ngeological periods, we may briefly state that they have been found in\r\nevery formation from the Silurian to the Tertiary. The species, at first\r\nvery simple in their forms, begin to appear in increasing numbers in the\r\ncarboniferous formations. They become more numerous, and, at the same\r\ntime, more complex in their forms, in the Cretaceous period; they are\r\nstill more diversified, and appear to have multiplied much more rapidly\r\nin the Tertiary period, where they attain the maximum of their numerical\r\ndevelopment. In the celebrated quarries of St. Peter, at Maestrecht, the\r\n_Siderolites calcitrapoides_ of Lamarck are found in the upper chalk\r\n(Fig. 23). In the calcareous formation of Chaussy, in the Seine and Oise\r\ndistrict, and other parts of the Paris basin, the _Fabularia\r\ndiscolithes_ (Fig. 24) of Defrance is found. Finally, the _Dactylopora\r\ncylindracea_ of Lamarck (Fig. 26) is found in the eocene formation of\r\nValmondois and in the chalk of Grignon. At first, this little creature\r\nwas thought to be a polype; but d'Orbigny, in his \"Prodrome de\r\nPaleontologie,\" has placed it among the Foraminifera, thinking that it\r\nappeared to occupy a place between the two classes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Fabularia discolithes (Defrance). Natural size\r\nand magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. Alveolina oblonga (d'Orbigny). Natural size and\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Dactylopora cylindracea (Lamarck). Natural size\r\nand magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe existing Foraminifera are by no means equally distributed in every\r\nocean. Some genera belong to warm countries, others to temperate and\r\ncold climates. They are much more numerous, however, and much more\r\nvaried in their forms, in warm than in cold climates, and, we may add,\r\nlarger also, for Sir E. Belcher brought a recent species from Borneo\r\nwhich measured two inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the study of the Infusoria, a few words may be\r\noffered on the _Noctiluca_, a genus of animals usually referred to the\r\nclass ACALEPHÆ. One species only of this genus has been described, which\r\noccurs occasionally on the English coast in prodigious numbers. It is a\r\nsmall creature, scarcely the hundredth part of an inch in diameter,\r\naccording to Mr. Huxley (Fig. 27, _Noctiluca miliaris_). It was\r\ndiscovered by M. Surriray, in 1810, who describes it as a spherical\r\ngelatinous mass, scarcely bigger than a pin's head, with a long filiform\r\ntentacular appendage, a mouth, an oesophagus, one or many stomachs, and\r\nbranching ovaries--thus exhibiting a certain complexity of organization.\r\nDe Blainville took the same view, and placed it among the _Diphydæ_. Van\r\nBeneden and Doyère, on the other hand, deny its relation to the\r\n_Acalephæ_, conceiving its organization to be much more simple: they\r\nplace it with the _Rhizopoda_. Quatrefages adopts the same view, denying\r\nthe existence of a true mouth or intestinal canal: he considers the\r\nso-called stomachs as simple \"vacuales,\" similar to those observed in\r\nthe Rhizopoda and Infusoria. Mr. Huxley, describing it in the \"Journal\r\nof Microscopical Science\" (vol. iii.), says it has nearly the form of a\r\npeach, a filiform tentacle, equal in length to the diameter of the body,\r\noccupying the place where the stalk of the peach might be, which depends\r\nfrom it, and exhibits slow wavy motions when the creature is in full\r\nactivity. \"I have even seen a _noctiluca_,\" he adds, \"appear to push\r\nagainst obstacles with this tentacle.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Noctiluca miliaris. Magnified.]\r\n\r\n\"The body,\" he continues, \"is composed of a structureless and somewhat\r\ndense external membrane, which is continued on to the tentacle. Beneath\r\nthis is a layer of granules, or rather of gelatinous membrane, through\r\nwhose substance minute granules are scattered without any very definite\r\narrangement; from hence arises a network of very delicate fibrils, whose\r\nmeshes are not more than one three-hundredth part of an inch in\r\ndiameter, which gradually pass internally--the reticulation becoming\r\nmore and more open--into coarser fibres, taking a convergent direction\r\ntowards the stomach and nucleus. All these fibres and fibrils are\r\ncovered with minute granules, which are usually larger towards the\r\ncentre.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley is inclined to think, from all he has observed, that the\r\nanimal has a definite alimentary cavity, and that this cavity has an\r\nexcretory aperture distinct from the mouth.\r\n\r\nSurriray discovered the _noctiluca_ while investigating the cause of\r\nphosphorescence of sea water at Havre, where it was abundant in the\r\nbasins; sometimes in such abundance as to form a crust on the surface of\r\nthe water of considerable thickness. \"This singular little creature,\"\r\nsays M. Frédol, \"offers here and there in its interior certain granules,\r\nprobably germs, and also luminous points, which appear and disappear\r\nwith great rapidity--the least agitation determining their lustre.\" The\r\n_noctiluca_ are so abundant in the Mediterranean and in some parts of\r\nthe channel, that in a cubic foot of sea water, which has been rendered\r\nphosphorescent by their presence, it is calculated that there exist\r\nabout twenty-five thousand.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFUSORIA.\r\n\r\nWith the Infusoria we return to the domain of the infinitely little. Of\r\nthis very interesting group a large proportion are marine, and numerous\r\nvarieties of them are found in British seas. In their minuteness and\r\nvariety they almost baffle the attempts of naturalists to classify them.\r\n\r\nThe waters, both fresh and salt, are inhabited by legions of active,\r\never-moving beings, of dimensions so small as to be inappreciable to the\r\nnaked eye; these minute creatures are disseminated by millions and\r\nthousands of millions in the great deep, and all knowledge of them would\r\nhave escaped us, as they escaped the knowledge of the ancients, but for\r\nthe discovery of the microscope, the sixth sense of man, as it has been\r\nhappily expressed by the historian and poet Michelet. Another writer of\r\nequally poetical mind, M. Frédol, tells us that \"the infusorial\r\nanimalcules are so small that a drop of water may contain them in many\r\nmillions. They exist in all waters, the fresh as well as the salt, the\r\ncold as well as the hot. The great rivers are continually discharging\r\nthem in vast quantities into the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ganges transports them in the course of one year in masses equal to\r\nsix or eight times the size of the great pyramid of Egypt. Among these\r\nanimalcules, according to Ehrenberg, we may reckon seventy-one different\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe water collected in vases between the Philippine and the Marianne\r\nIsles at the depth of twenty-two thousand feet (making some allowance\r\nfor erroneous soundings), have yielded a hundred and sixteen species.\r\nNear the Poles, where beings of higher organization could not exist, the\r\nInfusoria are still met with in myriads; those which were observed in\r\nthe Antarctic Seas, during the voyages of Captain Sir James Ross, offer\r\na richness of organization, often accompanied by elegance of form, quite\r\nunknown in more northern regions. In the residuum of the blocks of ice\r\nfloating about in latitude seventy-eight degrees ten minutes, nearly\r\nfifty different species were found. Many of them had ovaries, according\r\nto Ehrenberg, still green, which proved that they had struggled\r\nsuccessfully with the rigours of the climate in searching for food.\r\n\r\nAt a depth in the sea which exceeds the height of the loftiest mountain,\r\nHumboldt asserts that each bed of water is animated by an innumerable\r\nphalanx of inhabitants imperceptible to the human eye. These microscopic\r\ncreatures are, in short, the smallest and the most numerous creations in\r\nNature. They constitute with human beings one of the wheels of that very\r\ncomplicated machine, the globe. They are in the rank and at the station\r\nwilled for them, as determined in the great First Thought. Suppress\r\nthese microscopic beings, and the world would be incomplete. It was\r\nsaid, and wisely said, long, long ago, \"there is nothing so small to the\r\nview but that it may become great by reflection.\"\r\n\r\nThe Infusoria, in short, abound everywhere. We find their remains on the\r\nloftiest mountain ridges, and in the profoundest depths of the sea. They\r\nincrease and multiply alike under the Equator, and towards the polar\r\nregions. The seas, rivers, ponds--the flower vase which rests upon the\r\ncasement--even our tissues, and the fluids of our bodies--all contain\r\ninfusorial animalcules. Whole beds of strata, often many feet thick, and\r\ncovering a surface of considerable extent, are almost exclusively formed\r\nof their accumulated débris. It is to the Infusoria that the mud of the\r\nNile and other fluviatile and lacustrine deposits owe their prodigious\r\nfertility. To them also is due the red or green layer of colouring\r\nmatter found in ponds and tanks at certain seasons. When exposed to\r\ngreat solar heat, in order to extract the salt, as it is in the vast\r\nartificial basins hollowed out for the purpose in the salt marshes near\r\nthe sea-shore in the south of France, the salt water, when it reaches a\r\ncertain degree of concentration, acquires a fine rose colour, which is\r\ndue to the presence of innumerable masses of small Infusoria having a\r\nreddish shell. Finally, let us add that the solid débris of certain\r\nfossil Infusoria, of surprising minuteness, have formed the stone so\r\nmuch used by workers in metal, which is known as _tripoli_.\r\n\r\nThe study of these creatures is intensely interesting to the naturalist,\r\nthe philosopher, the physician, and the general reader. They have had a\r\ngreat part assigned to them in Nature, as is evident in the formation of\r\ncertain beds of rock of immense extent, in which the geologist traces\r\ntheir action.\r\n\r\nOur earliest knowledge of the Infusoria is traceable to the seventeenth\r\ncentury; to the celebrated naturalist, Leuwenhoek, we are indebted for\r\ntheir discovery. On the 24th of April, 1676, this observer saw for the\r\nfirst time some infusorial animalcules. Fifty years later, Baker and\r\nTrembley studied them anew. In 1752, Hill essayed the first attempt at\r\ntheir classification. In 1764, Wiesberg gave them the name of Infusoria,\r\nbecause he found them in such great abundance in animal and vegetable\r\n_infusions_. Müller published a special book upon them.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the Infusoria have been considered as forming a special\r\ngroup among the radiate animals; afterwards, in the pages of Baer and of\r\nDe Blainville, we see in these creatures, so imperfect in appearance,\r\nonly the indeterminate prototype of other classes. But ideas changed\r\naltogether respecting them when microscopes of great power, and armed\r\nwith achromatic lens, were employed in their study. Thanks to the\r\nlabours of Ehrenberg and Dujardin, we have arrived at a better\r\ncomprehension of the organization of these infinitely small beings.\r\nNaturalists have established, with more exactness, the limits of the\r\nzoological group to which they belong.\r\n\r\nSome stagnant waters are so filled with Infusoria that it is only\r\nnecessary to dip at random into the liquid medium to procure them in\r\nabundance. In other waters they form a bed, occupying the whole basin.\r\nIn general, it is necessary to search for them where the water is calm,\r\nand occupied by vegetation of some kind, such as the _confervæ_, or\r\n_lemna_, &c., in the marshes, and _ceramium_ if in the sea. Certain\r\nInfusoria live not only in water, but also in places habitually moist,\r\nas among tufts of mosses; in beds of _oscillaria_, on moist soil, or on\r\nair-damp walls. Others live as parasites on the exterior or in the\r\ninterior of animals, such as _hydra_, _lombrics_, and _naïads_.\r\nQuantities of them are found in the liquid excrements and other\r\nproducts of certain organisms, and they have been noted even in women's\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nBut, as their name indicates, it is in aqueous infusions, vegetable or\r\nanimal, that these animalcules abound. Armed with a microscope, the\r\nreader may, with very little trouble, afford himself the pleasure of\r\nstudying these animals. It is only necessary to place some organic\r\ndébris--the white of an egg, or some grass, for example--in a vase with\r\na large mouth, filled with water, and expose it to the light and air.\r\nCertain reagents, as phosphate of soda, the phosphates, nitrates, or\r\noxalates of ammonia, or carbonate of soda added to these infusions, will\r\nsingularly favour the development of Infusoria.\r\n\r\nThere are also some accidental infusions which seem to furnish these\r\nmicroscopic beings in great abundance. Water which stagnates in garden\r\nsoil or in vegetable mould, in the watering-cart or in flower vases, is\r\nfilled with myriads of these beings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much for the medium in which they live, move, and have their being.\r\nLet us pass on to their organization. We have already dwelt on their\r\nextreme minuteness; their mean size is a fifth of a line or the sixtieth\r\npart of an inch; the largest species scarcely reveal themselves to the\r\nnaked eye. They are generally colourless; some of them are,\r\nnevertheless, green, blue, red, brown, and even blackish. Seen on the\r\nobject-glass of the microscope, they appear to be gelatinous,\r\ntransparent, and naked, or invested with an envelope more or less\r\nresistant, which we shall designate after Dujardin by the term\r\n_Sarcoda_, a substance which is homogeneous, diaphanous, elastic,\r\ncontractile, and, above all, destitute of every kind of organization.\r\nThey are usually ovoid or globular. Those most frequently met with, and\r\nwhich attract the most attention from observers, are furnished with\r\n_vibratile cilia_, which cover the whole body, acting as paddles. These\r\norgans are evidently intended to propel the animal from one place to\r\nanother. At other times they appear to be employed in conveying food to\r\nthe mouth, if we may use the expression. Some Infusoria are without\r\nthese cilia, having only one or many very slender filaments, the\r\nundulating movement of which suffices to determine their progression\r\nthrough the liquid which surrounds them.\r\n\r\nAuthors who have written on the Infusoria have sometimes, like\r\nLeuwenhoek, Ehrenberg, and Pouchet, attributed to them a very complex\r\nstructure. Others, like Müller, Cuvier, and Lamarck, have considered\r\nthem to be gifted with an organization extremely simple. We shall\r\nprobably find that the truth lies between these two extremes.\r\n\r\nIn the superior Infusoria, besides the granules, the interior globules,\r\nvesicles full of liquid, vibratile cils, and a tegumentary system, more\r\nor less complex, we find the substance which is called _Sarcoda_.\r\n\r\nThe digestive apparatus of the Infusoria has been the subject of\r\nnumerous observations, and has been provocative of very animated\r\ndiscussions. In the inferior order of the class, which comprehends the\r\nvery smallest animalcules, it has not been found possible to observe the\r\norganization of the digestive apparatus in a satisfactory manner. Some\r\nwriters think they have no mouth, what has been taken for that organ\r\nbeing only hollow dimples on the surface of the body; others recognize\r\nthe existence of a buccal orifice, sometimes furnished with a solid\r\narmature. As to the arrangements of the interior cavities in which\r\ndigestion takes place, we know nothing certain.\r\n\r\nThe digestive apparatus is better understood in the superior Infusoria,\r\ncalled _ciliate_, namely, those provided with _vibratile cils_. These\r\ncils seem to determine the currents of the liquid, leading the nutritive\r\ncorpuscles suspended in the water towards the entrance of the digestive\r\napparatus. They form, in some sort, the prehensile organs which seize\r\nthe aliment. The cils are, at the same time, the organs intended to\r\nfacilitate respiration; in short, these little whips playing upon the\r\nwater unceasingly round the Infusoria, is just the action required for\r\nthe absorption of the oxygen contained in the water. These cils, then,\r\nserve at once for the propulsion of the animal, for its nutrition, and\r\nfor its respiration, presenting a remarkable example of cumulative\r\nfunctions in physiology.\r\n\r\nThe corpuscles of nutritive substances directed towards the buccal\r\norifice by the vibratile cils soon disappear in the interior of the\r\nanimal. Availing himself of this fact and the transparency of the\r\nanimal, Herr Gleichen, a German physiologist of the last century,\r\nconceived the happy idea of colouring the water which contained these\r\nanimalcules with a finely-powdered carmine; he traced the colouring\r\nmatter in the bodies of some of them. But it was reserved for Ehrenberg\r\nto avail himself of the same artifice in order to study the internal\r\nstructure and mode of absorbing nutritive matter in these minute\r\ncreatures. This physiologist fed many groups of Infusoria, some of them\r\nwith water coloured with carmine, others with indigo and other\r\ncolouring matters. He saw, besides, some coloured globules, nearly\r\nuniform in size, in different individuals of the same species. From this\r\nhe arrived at the conclusion that the colouring matter was deposited in\r\nmany of the surrounding dimples. Ehrenberg thought that each of these\r\ndimples was a stomach, and that the introduction of the food into the\r\ninterior of these reservoirs, as well as the evacuations, were produced\r\nby means of an intestine around which these stomachs are arranged. In\r\nsome cases he even thought he could distinguish the outlines of this\r\nintestinal canal, and its connection with numbers of ampula or bladders.\r\nGeneralizing the conclusions drawn from his observations, in short, we\r\nfind that his class, Infusoria, embraced two very different forms of\r\nanimal life, which he divided into _Infusoria_, _Polygastrica_, and\r\n_Rotifera_, the latter division including those known as Wheel\r\nanimalcules; the _Polygastrica_ being so called from his idea that the\r\ntypical forms possessed a number of stomachs. In some, Ehrenberg counted\r\nfour stomachs, an organization which brings these microscopic beings\r\ninto a strange kind of comparison with the ox and the goat. In others he\r\ncounted two stomachs.\r\n\r\nOther observers were not slow in raising objections to these views.\r\nDujardin, especially, was much opposed to the batch of stomachs\r\nattributed to these creatures by the German physiologist. He attempted\r\nto establish the fact that the coloured globules which appeared in the\r\nbodies of the Infusoria, while subjected to a regimen of carmine and\r\nindigo, are not confined by a membrane; that is to say, they are not\r\ncontained in intestinal sacs. According to Milne Edwards, \"they are a\r\nspecies of basins, constituted,\" he says, \"by the alimentary matter with\r\nwhich each is gorged, united into a rounded pasty mass, where it could\r\nno longer be dispersed, but would continue to advance, still preserving\r\nits form. We have, in short, seen these spherules changing their places,\r\nand passing one another in their progress from the mouth to the\r\nintestinal canal. That they could not do this is evident, if many\r\nstomachs were attached to the intestinal canal!\"\r\n\r\nThis opinion, due to the patient and precise studies of Dujardin, has\r\nbeen adopted by most naturalists of eminence. Besides, this learned\r\nmicroscopist does not admit that there was in the sarcodic mass of\r\nInfusoria any pre-existent cavity destined to receive the food. In a\r\nword, he does not recognise any stomach whatever. This view of the\r\nextreme simplicity of structure in the Infusoria has, however, met with\r\nmuch opposition. To accord them neither four nor two stomachs, it is not\r\nnecessary to deprive them of the organ altogether. Meyen represents them\r\nas having one great hollow stomach occupied by a pulpy matter, into\r\nwhich the alimentary masses are successively absorbed. \"All recent\r\nobservations,\" says Milne Edwards, \"tend to establish the fact that the\r\ndigestive apparatus of the ciliate Infusoria consists of--first, a\r\nmouth; second, of a pharyngeal canal, in which the food often assumes\r\nthe form of a _bolus_; third, of one great stomach with distinct walls,\r\nand more or less distant from the common tegumentary membrane; fourth,\r\nof an excretory orifice.\"\r\n\r\nThis mouth presents sensible differences both as to its position and\r\nconformation, often occupying the bottom of a hollow, the edges of which\r\nare furnished with well-developed _cilia_, the action of which attracts\r\nthe aliment; in short, the mouth is a sort of decoy at the bottom of a\r\nsimple pit, being at once contractile and prehensile, the interior part\r\nbeing sometimes capable, according to Milne Edwards, of being turned\r\ninside out in the form of a trumpet, while in a great many species it is\r\nprovided with a peculiar armature, consisting of a band of rigid\r\nbristles disposed in the form of a bow-net, and susceptible of\r\ndilatation and contraction, according to the wants of the animal. The\r\noesophagus, which is connected by means of the canal with the mouth, has\r\ngenerally an oblique direction backwards, often terminating in a great\r\nundivided stomach.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction of the Infusoria exhibits some very surprising\r\nphenomena, while it offers another proof of the wonderful means Nature\r\nemploys for perpetuating the races of animals. They can be reproduced by\r\nthree different processes: 1. By _gemmation_, or budding, somewhat after\r\nthe manner of plants. 2. By sexual reproduction; for in these little\r\ncreatures it has recently been discovered that sexual differences exist.\r\n3. By the spontaneous division of the animal into two individuals--a\r\nprocess known to zoologists as _fissiparism_ or _fission_.\r\n\r\nAmong these three processes, that which appears best understood is the\r\nlast. The singular phenomenon of spontaneous division may be witnessed\r\nby any one having patience to examine the creature long enough, isolated\r\nfrom its innumerable companions, under the microscope. The oblong body\r\nof the animal will soon be observed to contract at the middle, the\r\ncompression becoming more and more marked. The lower segment soon\r\nbegins to show a few vibratile cils, thus indicating the place which\r\nwill soon be a new mouth; the organ soon becomes more and more distinct,\r\nand now the Infusoria literally cuts itself into two parts. We see, at\r\nfirst, the fragment of glutinous substance fluttering on the edge of the\r\nplate; the two halves then separate from each other very quickly, each\r\nmoiety having finally a perfect resemblance to the primitive animal.\r\nThis process is represented in Fig. 28, A and B being the adult, C the\r\nsame in course of separation, D after its completion. Assuredly this is\r\none of the most remarkable phenomena which the study of living beings\r\ncan present. \"By this mode of propagation,\" says Dujardin, \"an infusoria\r\nis the half of the one which preceded it, the fourth of the parent of\r\nthat, the eighth of its grand-parent, and so on, if we can apply the\r\nterms father or mother to animals which must see in its two halves the\r\ngrandfather himself by a new division again living in his four parts. We\r\nmight imagine such an infusoria to be an aliquot part of one like it,\r\nwhich had lived years, and even ages before, and which by continued\r\nsubdivision into pairs might continue to live for ever by its successive\r\ndevelopment.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Propagation of an Infusoria by spontaneous\r\ndivision.]\r\n\r\nThis mode of generation, however, enables us to comprehend the\r\nmiraculous fecundity of these beings. The process defies calculation, if\r\nwe wished to be precise. We may, however, arrive at a proximate estimate\r\nof the number which may be derived from a single individual by this\r\nprocess of fission. It has been found that at the end of a month two\r\n_Stylonichiæ_ had a progeny of more than one million and forty-eight\r\nthousand individuals, and that in a lapse of forty-two days a single\r\n_Paramecium_ had produced more than one million three hundred and\r\nsixty-four thousand forms like itself.\r\n\r\nLife is spread over Nature in such abundance that the smallest infusoria\r\nhas its parasite a little smaller; these in their turn serving as \"a\r\ndwelling and pasture ground,\" to use Humboldt's words, for still smaller\r\nanimalcules, as represented in Fig. 29--_a_ being parasites in various\r\nstages; _b_, the larger animalcule on which they have established\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. Paramecium aurelia and its Parasites.]\r\n\r\nThe prodigious number to which the calculation would reach, if we were\r\nto add the other modes of propagation, viz., by germs and by budding, we\r\ndare not mention: it would only be necessary to place a single germ in a\r\nfavourable condition for its development, in order to produce myriads of\r\nthese microscopic animalcules in a very few days.\r\n\r\nWe have seen three modes of reproduction in the Infusoria; it is\r\npossible that a fourth mode exists, to which its partisans give the name\r\nof _spontaneous generation_. According to their views, an infusoria can\r\nbe produced without egg-germ or pre-existent parent. It would be\r\nsufficient to expose organic matter, animal or vegetable, to the action\r\nof the air and water at a suitable temperature, in order to see this\r\nmatter organize itself, and form itself into living infusorial animals.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general enumeration of the question of spontaneous or\r\n_heterogeneous_ generation, on which so much has been written in the\r\nlast ten years. The great expounders of the doctrine have been the two\r\nFrench naturalists, MM. Pouchet and Joly. Their views have, however,\r\nmade little progress; they have, on the contrary, met with vigorous\r\nopposition from the generality of French naturalists, and from most of\r\nthe members of the Académie des Sciences of Paris, who have raised their\r\nvoices against a doctrine which is contrary to the ordinary course of\r\nnature. In short, the direct observations made upon the theory of\r\n\"primitive generation\" are as yet wanting in necessary exactness; those\r\nobservers who profess to have witnessed the sudden origin of the\r\nminutest of the infusoria from elementary substances have in all\r\nprobability overlooked the organic structure of these elementary bodies.\r\nThe wonderful changes of form undergone by many infusoria have their\r\nlimits, and the laws governing them have still to be defined. With the\r\npoet we may say:\r\n\r\n    \"Grammatici certant et adhuc sub judice lis est.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the Infusoria are subject to metamorphoses, and it has already\r\nbeen ascertained that certain species which have been considered as\r\ndistinct are only transition forms of the same species depending on age.\r\n\r\nWe know that it is common for insects to enclose themselves in\r\nprotecting envelopes, and to remain for whole months shut up in this\r\ntheir retreat, to all appearance dead. Similar facts have been observed\r\nin the Infusoria. We have even seen some of these beings surrounding\r\nstrange bodies as if in a mass of jelly, forming a sort of living\r\nenvelope around them.\r\n\r\nThe average duration of life with them is only a few hours; but certain\r\nspecies present, in relation to the duration of life, phenomena which\r\nare only imperfectly known, but which never fail to excite the surprise\r\nand admiration of the naturalist. By drying certain infusoria with care,\r\nit is possible to suspend and indefinitely prolong its life. Thus dried,\r\nand covered with a powder, which shelters it from every breath of wind,\r\nit may be carried to any given distance, through any indefinite period\r\nof time--abandoned on some ledge of rock, on a housetop, in the cleft\r\nof a wall, or under the capital of a column; but let a drop of water\r\napproach it, and the dormant being awakes immediately--the microscopic\r\nLazarus springs again into existence: feeds and multiplies as before:\r\nand its life, suspended possibly for years, resumes its interrupted\r\ncourse!\r\n\r\nInto what a world of reflection does not a revelation of this mysterious\r\nproperty of a living creature plunge us!\r\n\r\nThe physiologist Müller has noted another peculiarity in infusorial\r\nlife. These animalcules can lose a part of their bodies without being\r\ndestroyed; the dead part disappears, and the individual, diminished by\r\none-half, or reduced to a fourth of its former size, continues to live\r\nas if nothing had happened. Müller has observed a kalpode (_Kolpoda\r\nmeleagris_) thus melt before his eyes until scarcely a sixteenth part of\r\nits body remained. After its loss, this sixteenth part of an animal\r\ncontinued to swim about without troubling itself as to its diminished\r\nproportions. \"The infusoria,\" says Frédol, in \"La Monde de la Mer,\"\r\n\"present yet another kind of decomposition. If we approach the drop of\r\nwater in which it swims with the barb of a feather dipped in ammonia,\r\nthe animalcule is arrested in its movement, but its cils continue to\r\nmove rapidly. All at once, upon some point of its circumference, a notch\r\nis formed, which increases bit by bit until the whole animal is\r\ndissolved. If a drop of pure water is added, the decomposition is\r\nsuddenly stopped, and what remains of the animalcule recommences its\r\nswimming movements.\" (Dujardin.)\r\n\r\nWe may divide the Infusoria into two orders--the _Ciliate Infusoria_,\r\nnamely, those provided with vibratile cilia, and the _Flagelliferous\r\nInfusoria_, those, namely, which have arms or branches. The greater part\r\nof Infusoria belong to the first order, which comprehends many families;\r\nour space limits us to the mention here of a few typical forms only in\r\neach group, selecting those which appear the most interesting, from\r\ntheir size, structure, rarity, or abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAGELLIFEROUS INFUSORIA.\r\n\r\nThe family of _Vibrionidæ_, so named from their darting or quivering\r\nmotion, includes the eel-like microscopic animalcules which occur in\r\nstale paste, vinegar, &c., with some others, which are parasitic on\r\nliving vegetables, such as _Vibrio tritici_, which infest the grains of\r\nwheat, producing the destructive disease called corn-cockle or purples.\r\nThey are filiform animals, extremely slender, without appreciable\r\norganization, internal stomach, or apparent organs of locomotion. They\r\nare the first animalcules which show themselves in any infusion of\r\norganic matter. By using microscopes of the highest magnifying power,\r\ntraces of very thin, short lines can be perceived, either straight or\r\nsinuous, the thickest of them not exceeding the thousandth part of the\r\nfraction of an inch. They are contractile, and propagated by spontaneous\r\ndivision, or _fission_. Among them some resemble right lines, more or\r\nless distinctly articulated, and endowed with a very slow movement;\r\nthese are _Bacteridæ_. Others are flexuous and undulating, and more or\r\nless lively; these are true _Vibrions_. Others have the body fashioned\r\nin the form of a corkscrew, turning unceasingly upon themselves with\r\ngreat rapidity; these are the _Spirillidæ_, having an oblong fusiform or\r\nfiliform body, which undulates or turns spirally upon itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. Bacterium, termo (Müller), magnified 600 times.\r\n\r\nThe same, magnified 1600 times.]\r\n\r\nThe _Bacterium termo_ (Fig. 30) is the smallest of the Infusoria. It is\r\nfound, at the end of a short time, in all vegetable or animal infusions\r\nexposed to the air. It shows itself in infinite numbers, forming swarms\r\nof animalcules, which disappear as other species multiply in the liquid,\r\nto which animals it serves for nourishment. When the infusion becomes\r\ntoo foetid for these new species to live in it, in consequence of\r\nfermentation or putrefaction, the _Bacterium termo_ reappears. This\r\nspecies was one of the first observed; Leuwenhoek found it in the white\r\nmatter in the teeth and gums, which is called teeth tartar. It is also\r\nfound in the fluids of various animals which have been affected by\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Vibrion baguette (Müller), magnified 300 times.]\r\n\r\nThe _Wand-like Vibrion_ (Fig. 31) has the body transparent, filiform,\r\nwith long articulations, often appearing as if broken at each\r\nconnection. It moves very slowly in the water. Leuwenhoek observed this\r\nsecond species joined to the first in the teeth tartar, and also in a\r\ngreat number of organic infusions. \"There is no microscopic object,\"\r\nsays Dujardin, \"which excites the admiration of the observer more\r\nvividly than the twisting spirillum\" (Fig. 32). He is struck with\r\nsurprise when he first contemplates this little creature, which, under\r\nthe greatest magnifying power, only presents the appearance of a thin\r\nblack line, fashioned like a corkscrew, which every instant turns upon\r\nitself with marvellous velocity, such as the eye can scarcely follow, or\r\nthe mind divine the cause which produces this startling phenomenon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Spirillum tournoyant (Ehr.), magnified 300\r\ntimes.]\r\n\r\nThe _Monads_ are other infusorial animalcules which make an early\r\nappearance in vegetable infusions. They constitute a family that are\r\ndestitute of any covering. The substance of their bodies can swallow\r\nitself, or draw itself out more or less; many of the whip-like filaments\r\nserve as organs of locomotion. They are sometimes provided with lateral\r\nappendages disposed as a kind of tail. Their organization is extremely\r\nsimple; their whip-like filaments are so fine as to be scarcely\r\nperceptible, their length being sometimes double and even quadruple the\r\nlength of the animal itself.\r\n\r\nThe _Lentille Monad_ (Fig. 33) is a species which is frequently met with\r\nin vegetable and animal infusions. The older microscopists had it\r\nindicated under the form of a globule, moving in a slow and vacillating\r\nmanner. The globule is formed of a homogeneous transparent substance,\r\nswollen into tubercles on its surface, and throws out obliquely a\r\nwhip-like filament, three, four, or even five times the length of the\r\nbody of the Monad.\r\n\r\nThe _Cercomonad_ of Davaine was discovered by this gentleman in the\r\nstill warm ejections of cholera patients. Its body is pyriform, having,\r\nin front, a vibratile filament, very long, very flexible, and easily\r\nagitated. Behind the body there is a thicker straight filament attaching\r\nitself sometimes to neighbouring corpuscles, round which, in this case,\r\nthe _Cercomonad_ oscillates like the ball of a pendulum round its stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. Monade lentille (Dujardin), magnified 1000\r\ntimes.]\r\n\r\nThe _Volvocineæ_ are inhabitants of fresh limpid water full of confervæ\r\nand other aquatic plants. The _Volvocineæ_ are, according to Dujardin,\r\nanimalcules of a green or yellowish brown colour, regularly disseminated\r\nin the thickness and near the surface of a gelatinous and transparent\r\nglobe, which would become hollow and be filled with water in its perfect\r\nstate. In this state, from five to eight smaller globules, with the same\r\norganization, appear destined to undergo the same changes when they are\r\nreleased by the rupture of the globule. These animalcules are each\r\nfurnished with one or two flagelliform filaments, which, by their\r\nagitation, determine the movement by rotation of the mass.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable phenomenon is recorded in the Transactions of the\r\nMicroscopic Society, namely, the conversion of the contents of an\r\nordinary vegetable cell into a free moving mass of Protoplasm, bearing a\r\nstrong resemblance to the animal _Amoebæ_ (Fig. 20). This, it is\r\naffirmed by Dr. Hicks, takes place in Volvox, under circumstances which\r\nsuggest a vegetable transformation. But Dr. Carpenter does not consider\r\nthat this involves any real confusion in the boundaries of Animal and\r\nVegetable Life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 34 and 35. Volvox globator (Müller), magnified 700\r\ntimes.]\r\n\r\nThe Revolving Volvox, _V. globator_ (Figs. 34 and 35), is found in great\r\nabundance, during summer, in tanks and ponds of stagnant water. It\r\nconsists of green or brownish-yellow globules about the eighth part of\r\nan inch, formed of animalcules scattered round a gelatinous and\r\ndiaphanous spherical membrane, each furnished with a flagelliform\r\nfilament and with a reddish interior point, which Ehrenberg took for an\r\neye. Leuwenhoek first observed this Volvox in marshy waters. This\r\neminent naturalist has left a very interesting account of his\r\nobservations on these microscopic inhabitants of the waters, displaying\r\nan amount of patience and address which cannot be too much admired; his\r\nobservations were made with a simple lens, which he constructed himself.\r\nIn one hand he held his instrument, which was very coarse if we compare\r\nit to the more perfect and infinitely more powerful instruments now in\r\nuse; whilst, in the other hand, he carried to his eye the glass tube\r\nfull of water which contained the object under observation. \"The\r\nmicroscopes of Leuwenhoek,\" says Dujardin, \"were the very smallest\r\nbi-convex lenses, mounted in a silver frame. He made a collection of\r\ntwenty-six, which he bequeathed to the Royal Society of London. These\r\ninstruments, subject to all the inconveniences of a maximum of\r\nspherical aberration and a total want of stability, were only fit for\r\nuse in the hands of Leuwenhoek himself, who had acquired, in his labour\r\nof twenty years, habits of observation which compensated, in great part,\r\nfor the want of perfection in his instruments.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Eugleniæ_ are infusoria usually coloured green or red. Their form\r\nis very variable. They are oblong or fusiform in shape, swelling at the\r\nmiddle during action, and contracted or bowl-shaped in repose, or after\r\ndeath. They are furnished with the usual whip-shaped filament, which\r\nissues from an opening in front, and from one or many reddish points\r\nirregularly placed anteriorly.\r\n\r\n_Euglenia viridis_ (Fig. 36) is the most common species, and, perhaps,\r\nthe most widely diffused of all the Infusoria. It is this animalcule\r\nwhich habitually covers stagnant pools with its floating surface of\r\ngreen, and which forms, on the surface of marshy waters, the shining\r\npellicle so strongly coloured, which, collected upon paper, so long\r\npreserves its brilliant tint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86. Euglenia viridis (Ehr.), magnified 350 times.]\r\n\r\nThe _Euglenia sanguinea_, at first green, becomes subsequently of a\r\nblood colour. It has often been met with by microscopists. Ehrenberg,\r\nwho first described it, attributes to its great abundance the red colour\r\nof some stagnant waters. Its presence explains the pretended miracle of\r\nwater changing into blood, which was frequently invoked by the Egyptian\r\npriests.\r\n\r\n\r\nCILIATE INFUSORIA.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a glance at some of the more remarkable species of\r\nCiliate Infusoria. The bodies of these creatures are all more or less\r\ntranslucent. They have not substance enough, in fact, to reach a state\r\nof opacity. Their bodies are more or less globular or ovoid, sometimes\r\nfashioned like a shuttle, or curved while growing, sometimes swollen in\r\nthe middle like an ampulla, or bell-shaped, and flattened into a discoid\r\nshape; some slightly resemble a tadpole, a thimble, a shoe, a rose-bud,\r\na flower, even a seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. Cothurnia pyxidiformis (Udckem).]\r\n\r\nThe Paramecians have a soft flexible body, usually of oblong form, and\r\nmore or less depressed. They are provided with a loose reticulated\r\ncovering, through which issue numerous vibratile cilia, arranged in a\r\nregular series. They were known to the older naturalists; and it is in\r\nthis group that organization is carried to the highest perfection it\r\nattains among the Infusoria. The Paramecium possess, besides their\r\nreticulated and contractile tegument, cilia disposed in such a manner as\r\nto serve at once for locomotion, for prehension, that is, for seizing\r\nits food, and as a means of respiration. They are furnished with a\r\nmouth, at the bottom of which the whorl excited by the cilia determines,\r\naccording to Dujardin, the hollowing out of a cavity, formed after the\r\nmanner of a cul-de-sac, and also the formation of _vacuoles_ with\r\npermanent partitions, in which are enclosed the substances which the\r\nanimalcules have swallowed along with the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Paramecium bursaria (Pritchard).]\r\n\r\nThe Paramecium are propagated by spontaneous division, as already\r\ndescribed. They abound, as we have said, in stagnant water, or in pure\r\nwater which is occupied by aquatic plants, sometimes in such prodigious\r\nquantities that they become troublesome. They occur also in flower vases\r\nwhere the water is not frequently renewed.\r\n\r\nThe species of this genus have an oblong compressed body, with an\r\noblique longitudinal fold, directed towards the mouth, which is\r\nlateral. They are sufficiently large to be observed by the common lens,\r\nor eye-glass. _Paramecium aurelia_ appears chiefly in vegetable\r\ninfusions. It is common in ditches and moats with aquatic plants.\r\n\r\nHumboldt's assertion is fully verified in the case of the Infusoria\r\nunder consideration, which is often found with its parasites. These are\r\nsmall creatures, cylindrical in form, and provided with suckers.\r\nSwimming vigorously in the water, they devote themselves to chasing the\r\nParamecium. When they have overtaken the fugitive, they throw themselves\r\nupon it, and establish themselves there. They soon multiply in the\r\ninterior of its body, and their starving progeny suck and devour the\r\nunfortunate animalcule, which serves them at once for dwelling-house and\r\nlarder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. Condylostoma patens (Duj.), magnified 350\r\ntimes.]\r\n\r\nAnother of the parasites which prey upon the Paramecium, in place of\r\npursuing it, remains perfectly quiet until one of these approach, when\r\nit throws itself upon its victim, and is carried along with it. It\r\nburies itself in the body of the Paramecium, and, in a short time,\r\nmultiplies to such a degree, that sometimes fifty of them are found on a\r\nsingle individual. Poor victim!\r\n\r\nThe _Nassula_ have the body entirely covered with cilia; they are ovoid\r\nor oblong in form, contractile, the mouth placed laterally and dentate,\r\nor surrounded with a band of horny bristles, the band dilating and\r\ncontracting according to the size of the prey which it would swallow. It\r\neither advances to seize the prey, which the movement of vibratile cilia\r\nhave failed to draw within the vortex of its mouth, or, as in the case\r\nof the Paramecium, it is sometimes obliged to seek for its prey. These\r\ncurious infusoria live in stagnant waters, feeding on the débris of\r\naquatic plants, from which they draw their chief nourishment as well as\r\ntheir colour.\r\n\r\nThe _Bursarians_ are animals with an oval or oblong contractile body,\r\nprovided also with vibratile cilia, especially on the surface, having\r\nalso a large mouth, surrounded with cilia, forming a sort of microscopic\r\nmoustache, spirally arranged.\r\n\r\nAmong the species belonging to this group may be noted the _Condylostoma\r\npatens_ (Fig. 39), remarkable for its size and voracity. It sometimes\r\nattains the twelfth of an inch, and abounds on every shore from the\r\nMediterranean to the Baltic. Another Bursarian, a species of\r\n_Plagiostoma_, lives between the intestines and the external muscular\r\nbed of the earth-worm, _Lumbricus terrestris_. To the group of\r\n_Urceolarians_ belong the _Stentors_, which are in number the most\r\nnumerous of the Infusoria; they are, for the most part, visible to the\r\nnaked eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. Stentor Muelleri (Enr.), magnified 75 times.]\r\n\r\nThe _Stentors_ are inhabitants of fresh, tranquil water, not subject to\r\nagitation, and covered with water plants. They are nearly all coloured\r\ngreen, blackish, or blue; their bodies covered with cilia. They are\r\neminently contractile, and very variable in form. They can attach\r\nthemselves temporarily, by means of the cils at their posterior\r\nextremities, when they assume a trumpet-like form, the bell of which is\r\nclosed by a convex membrane, the edge being furnished with a row of very\r\nstrong obliquely-placed cilia, ranged in a spiral, meeting at the mouth,\r\nwhich is placed near this edge. When they swim freely, they alternately\r\nresemble a club, a spindle, or a sphere. The _Stentor Muelleri_ is seen\r\nin ponds in the neighbourhood of Paris and elsewhere; it has been found\r\neven in the basins of the Jardins des Plantes (Fig. 40).\r\n\r\nThe animals which constitute this genus are fixed in the first part of\r\ntheir existence, but free in the second. So long as they are fixed, they\r\nresemble, in their expanding state, a bell or funnel, with the edges\r\nreversed and ciliate. When they become free, they lose their crown of\r\ncilia, take a cylindrical form, more or less ovoid and elongated, and\r\nmove themselves by means of a new organ. \"There is no animal,\" says\r\nDujardin, \"which excites our admiration in a higher degree than the\r\nVorticellate Infusoria, by their crown of cilia, and by the vortex which\r\nit produces; by their ever-varying forms; above all, by their _pedicle_,\r\nwhich is susceptible of rapid spiral contraction, by drawing the body\r\nbackward and again extending it. This _pedicle_ is a flat membranous\r\nband, thicker upon one of its edges than the other, and containing on\r\nthe thicker side a continuous channel, occupied, at least in part, by a\r\nfleshy substance, analogous to that of the interior of the body. During\r\ncontraction, this thick edge is shortened more than the thin side, and\r\nhence results the precise form of the spiral of the corkscrew.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot conclude our brief history of these curiously-organized beings\r\nwithout recording the doubt which still exists in the minds of our most\r\neminent naturalists, whether some of those we have named are animal or\r\nvegetable in their origin. The _Desmideæ_, long classed among animals,\r\nare now generally recognized as plants. The group of _Diatomaceæ_ are\r\nstill considered doubtful, and the Monads and _Volocina_ are still\r\nsubjects of discussion, the evidence inclining in favour of those who\r\nargue for their vegetable nature. Messrs. Busk, Williamson, and Cohn,\r\nhave published in the \"Microscopical Transactions\" minute details of the\r\nevolutions of these curiously-organized globules, which seem to prove\r\ntheir vegetable nature. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine so\r\naccurate an observer as Agassiz writing so positively as he does on a\r\ndoubtful subject. Remarking on a former paper, in which he had shown\r\nthat the embryo hatched from the egg of a Planaria was a true\r\npolygastric animalcule of the genus Paramecium, he adds, that in former\r\nwriters a link was wanting, viz., tracing the young hatched from the egg\r\nof _Distoma_. \"This deficiency,\" he says, \"I can now fill. It is another\r\n_Infusorium_, a genuine _Opalina_. With such facts before us there is no\r\nlonger any doubt left respecting the character of all these Polygastria;\r\nthey are the earliest larvæ condition of worms.\" Amid these friendly\r\ndisputes we congratulate ourselves that we have to do with the oceanic\r\ncreations, both animal and vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPOLYPIFERA.\r\n\r\n     \"Happy is he who, satisfied with his humble fortune, lives\r\n     contentedly in the obscure state where God has placed\r\n     him.\"--RACINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntering on the class Polypifera, we leave the domain of the infinitely\r\nsmall to enter the world of the visible. Beside the Infusoria, the\r\nPolypifera, which are sometimes several inches in length, are very\r\nimportant beings. Science has made great advances towards giving us an\r\nexact knowledge of these singular animals. Many scientific prejudices\r\nhave been dissipated, many errors have been corrected. The Polyps, as\r\nthey are defined in the actual state of Science, correspond not only\r\nwith the _Polypes, properly so called_, of Cuvier and De Blainville, but\r\nalso with the _acalephous zoophytes_ of the same authors. We now know\r\nthat certain Polyps engender _medusæ_, or acalephous zoophytes, and that\r\nthere exist some medusæ scarcely differing in their structure and habits\r\nof life from the ordinary Polyps.\r\n\r\nThus regarded, the Polyps comprehend a great variety of animals, the\r\nbodies of which are generally soft or gelatinous substances. The\r\nprincipal and smaller divisions, to the number of more than two, are\r\narranged round an imaginary axis, represented by the central part of the\r\nbody. These divisions of the body have in their ensemble the appearance\r\nof a regular cylinder, of a truncated cone, or of a disk. They are\r\ninvested with a skin or envelope of calcareous or siliceous corpuscles,\r\nand even a portion of the deepest-lying tissues may be invaded by a\r\ncalcareous deposit, the mass of which belongs sometimes to an\r\nindividual; sometimes it is common to many, constituting what Dr.\r\nJohnston calls the Polypidom, of which Professor Grant says, \"there is\r\nbut one life and one plan of development in the whole mass, and this\r\ndepends, not on the Polypi, which are but secondary, and often deciduous\r\nparts, but on the general fleshy substance of the body;\"[5] \"the\r\nramifications,\" says Dr. Johnston, \"being disposed in a variety of\r\nelegant plant-like forms. The stem and branches are alike in texture:\r\nslender, horny, fistular, and almost always jointed at short and regular\r\nintervals, the joint being a mere break in the continuity of the sheath,\r\nwithout any character of a proper hinge, and formed by regular\r\nperiodical interruptions in the growth of the polypidoms. Along the\r\nsides of these, or at their extremities, we find the denticles or\r\ncup-like cells of the polypi arranged in a determinate order, either\r\nsessile or elevated on a stalk.\" Near the base of each of these there is\r\na partition or diaphragm, on which the body of the polyps rests, with a\r\nplain or tubulous perforation in the centre, through which the\r\nconnection between the individual polyps and the common medullary pulp\r\nis retained. Besides the cells, there are found at certain seasons a\r\nlarger sort of vesicle, readily distinguished from the others by their\r\nsize, and the irregularity of their distribution, which are destined to\r\ncontain and maturate the ovules.\r\n\r\nWith these animals the digestive tube is very simple, and presents only\r\none distinct orifice; the same opening serving at once for receiving the\r\nfood and the expulsion of the residuum of digestion. This is one of\r\nNature's economies, which it is not for us to dispute: we must record it\r\nwithout further remark.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the Polyps the sexes are separate; the generation is\r\nsometimes sexual; but these beings multiply also by what the zoologists\r\ncall gemmation, or buds. They are provided with organs of the senses;\r\nnearly all of them have eyes--an immense progress in organization as\r\ncompared with the animals which have hitherto engaged our attention.\r\nTheir respiration is effected by the skin--another instance of the\r\neconomy of Nature. The apparatus of their circulation is indistinct, but\r\nthey have a nourishing fluid analogous to the blood in vertebrated\r\nanimals. Vibratile cilia and stinging hairs often cover the entire\r\nsurface of the Polyps.\r\n\r\nThese general remarks may appear obscure and insufficient to the larger\r\nnumber of our readers. They are necessarily so; they are generalities\r\nupon animals very little known, even to naturalists. We quit this\r\ndifficult ground, trusting to make the special study of the several\r\ntypes we shall have to describe more interesting. The group of Polyps\r\ndivide themselves into many classes, namely, the _Alcyonidæ_, the\r\n_Zoanthina_, the _Discophora_, and _Ctenophora_. It will be our task to\r\ndescribe in succession the habits and characters of each of these\r\nclasses, dwelling on such species as appear to us to offer to the reader\r\nmost real interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"Outlines of Comparative Anatomy.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCORALLINES.\r\n\r\n     \"As for your pretty little seed-cups or vases, they are a sweet\r\n     confirmation of the pleasure Nature seems to take in superadding\r\n     elegance of form to most of her works.

When I have the pleasure of seeing\r\n     you next, we shall sit down--nay, kneel down--and admire these\r\n     things.\"--HOGARTH TO ELLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Alcyonaria are so designated from their principal type, that of the\r\nAlcyons. The fresh-water species are composed of a fleshy, sponge-like\r\nmass, consisting of vertical, aggregated, membranaceous tubes, which are\r\nopen on the surface. In these tubes the polyps, which are Isidians, are\r\nlocated. The mouth is encircled with a single series of filiform\r\ntentacula, which, like those of the whole family, are depressed or\r\nincomplete on one side. The eggs are contained in the tubes, and are\r\ncoriaceous and smooth. The tentacula of these polyps are generally\r\neight, disposed somewhat like the barbs of a feather, and toothed on\r\ntheir edges like a saw, which has procured them the name of\r\n_Ctenoceros_, from the Greek word χτεις, a comb. Their bodies present\r\neight perigastric lamellæ; their coral is often formed of spiculæ. We\r\nshall see, farther on, that among the Gorgonidæ the coral ceases to be\r\nparenchymous--that is, spongy and cellular; that its axis assumes a\r\nhorny and resistant consistence, which becomes stony in the corallines.\r\nIn this last group, the external bed, which is the special lodging of\r\nthe polyps, always remains soft on the surface. We shall have a general\r\nidea of the organization, manners, and mode of multiplication among the\r\nAlcyonaria when we come to treat of corals and their strange history.\r\nThe class Alcyonaria is divided into many orders. We shall consider--I.\r\nThe _Tubiporinæ_. II. The _Gorgoniadæ_. III. The _Pennatulidæ_. IV. The\r\n_Alcyonaria_, properly so called.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE TUBIPORINÆ\r\n\r\nform a group consisting of several species, which live in the bosom of\r\ntropical seas, in which the Coral Islands form so prominent a feature.\r\nThe group is exclusively formed of the curious genus _Tubipora_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. Tubipora musica (Linn.), half the natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe _Tubipora_ is a calcareous coral, formed by a combination of\r\ndistinct, regularly-arranged tubes, connected together at regulated\r\ndistances by lamellar expansion of the same material. The aggregate\r\nformation resulting from this combination of tubes constitutes a rounded\r\nmass, which often attains a very considerable size. In Fig. 41 we have a\r\nrepresentation of the zoophyte _Tubipora musica_ and its product, which\r\nis sometimes designated by the vulgar name of Sea-Organ. In the\r\nengraving, 1 is the calcareous product, reduced to half its size; 2, is\r\na portion in its natural size; 3, the tubes magnified, and containing\r\nthe polyp which occupies the summit of the tube, the whole of which\r\nconstitutes this curious coral; 4, is the polyp magnified; 5, the head\r\nor collection of tentacula of the individual polyp.\r\n\r\nZoologists of the last century confounded all the species of this genera\r\ninhabiting the tropical seas, making only one species, to which they\r\ngave the name of _Tubipora musica_. But it is now known that there are\r\nmany species of _Tubiporæ_, readily distinguishable in a fresh condition\r\nby a difference in the colour of the polyps. The tissue of these\r\nsingular beings is of an intensely red colour. The disposition of their\r\ntubes in the style of organ pipes has always attracted the attention of\r\nthe curious inquirer into the secrets of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. GORGONIADÆ.\r\n\r\nMilne Edwards divides this order into three natural groups:--I. The\r\n_Gorgoniadæ_. II. The _Isidians_. III. The _Corallines_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. The Sea Fan, Gorgonia flabellum (Linn.).]\r\n\r\nThe _Gorgonians_ are composed of two substances: the one external,\r\nsometimes gelatinous and fugitive; sometimes, on the contrary,\r\ncretaceous, fleshy, and more or less tenacious. Animated with life,\r\nthis membrane is irritable and encloses the polyp; it becomes friable\r\nor arenaceous in drying. The second substance, internal and central,\r\nsustains the first, and is called the _axis_. This axis presents a horny\r\nappearance, and was formerly believed to possess chemical characters\r\nanalogous to the horns and hoofs of some of the vertebrated animals. It\r\nhas recently been asserted that the tissues of these corals consist\r\nessentially of a particular substance which resembles horn, but which is\r\ncalled _Corneine_. A little carbonate of lime is sometimes found united\r\nwith this substance, but never in a sufficient quantity to give it a\r\nstony consistence. This outer covering developes itself in concentric\r\nbeds, between the portion of the axis previously formed and the internal\r\nsurface of the sclerotic covering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. Fan Gorgon, magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe mode of growth in this axis presents great variations. Sometimes it\r\nremains simple and rises like a slender rod, sometimes it has numerous\r\nbranches. It is _arborescent_ when the branches and their accompaniments\r\ntake different directions so as to constitute tufts. It is _panicled_\r\nwhen they arrange themselves on both sides of the stem or principal\r\nbranches, after the manner of the barbs of a feather. It is\r\n_flabelliform_ when the branches rise irregularly under the same plane;\r\n_reticulated_, when branches are so disposed as to be attached to each\r\nother by network in place of remaining free.\r\n\r\nThe _Gorgoniadæ_ are found in every sea, and always at considerable\r\ndepths. They are larger and more numerous between the Tropics than in\r\ncold or even temperate climates. Some of these corals scarcely attain\r\nthe twelfth of an inch in height, while others rise to the height of\r\nseveral feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. Gorgonia verticellata (Pallas).]\r\n\r\nFormed in the bosom of the ocean, it is only necessary to behold these\r\nsingular creations in order to admire the brilliant colours which\r\ndecorate their semi-membranaceous branches. The brilliancy of their\r\nrobes are singularly diminished, have almost entirely disappeared,\r\nindeed, when they make their appearance in the cases of our natural\r\nhistory collections.\r\n\r\nThe _Fan Gorgon_, from the Antilles (Fig. 42), is a species which often\r\nattains the height of eighteen or twenty inches, and nearly as much in\r\nbreadth. The network of its interstices with its unequal and serried\r\nmeshes, resembling fine lace, have led to its designation of _Sea Fan_.\r\nIts colour is yellow or reddish. In Fig. 43 we have the _Sea Fan_\r\nmagnified to twice its natural size, showing the curious details of its\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45. Gorgonia verticellata (Pallas), magnified four\r\ntimes.]\r\n\r\nThe Whorled Gorgon (_G. verticellata_), which is found in the\r\nMediterranean, is yellowish in colour, and also of elegant form. It is\r\nsometimes called the Sea Pen. This species is represented in Fig. 44,\r\nwhile Fig. 45 represents a small branch magnified four times, in order\r\nto give an exact idea of its form.\r\n\r\nThe Gorgons are not known to be useful either in the arts or in\r\nmedicine. They are ornamental in cabinets, and interesting both as\r\nobjects of study and of zoological curiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nISIDIANS.\r\n\r\nThe _Isidæ_ constitute an intermediate group between the _Gorgons_ and\r\n_Corallines_. Their polypidom is arborescent, but its axis is formed of\r\narticulations alternately calcareous and horny. The principal genus is\r\nthat of the _Isis_, which is met with in the Indian Ocean, on the\r\nAmerican coast, and in Oceania. The inhabitants of the Molucca Islands\r\nuse these animals medicinally as a remedy in certain diseases; but as\r\nthey use them for the most opposite maladies, it may be doubted if they\r\nare really efficacious in any medicinal point of view.\r\n\r\nThe _Isis corolloïdis_ of Oceania has a coral with numerous slender\r\nbranches, furnished with cylindrical knots at intervals, contracted\r\ntowards the middle, finely striated, and rose-coloured. _Isis_\r\n_hippuris_, represented in Fig. 46, has a singular resemblance to the\r\nCommon Mare's Tail (_Hippuris vulgaris_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46. Isis hippuris.]\r\n\r\nFour other species of Isidians are known. The same family includes the\r\ngenera of _Melitæa_ and _Mopsea_, which, however, our limits forbid us\r\nto describe.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORALLINÆ.\r\n\r\nThe group of Corallines consist of a single genus, _Corallium_, having a\r\ncommon axis, inarticulate, solid, and calcareous, the typical species of\r\nwhich furnishes matter hard, brilliant, and richly coloured, and much\r\nsought after as an object of adornment. This interesting zoophyte and\r\nits product require to be described with some detail.\r\n\r\nFrom very early times, the coral has been adopted as an object of\r\nornament. From the highest antiquity, also, efforts were made to\r\nascertain its true origin, and the place assignable to it in the works\r\nof Nature. Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and Pliny considered that the\r\ncoral was a plant. Tournefort, in 1700, reproduced the same idea.\r\nRéaumur slightly modified this opinion of the ancients, and declared his\r\nopinion that the coral was the stony product of certain marine plants.\r\nScience was in this state when a naturalist, who has acquired a great\r\nname, the Count de Marsigli, made a discovery which threw quite a new\r\nlight on the true origin of this natural product. He announced that he\r\nhad discovered the flowers of the coral. He represented these flowers in\r\nhis fine work, \"La Physique de la Mer,\" which includes many interesting\r\ndetails respecting this curious product of the ocean. How could it be\r\nlonger doubted that the coral was a plant, since he had seen its\r\nexpanded flowers?\r\n\r\nNo one doubted it, and Réaumur proclaimed everywhere the discovery of\r\nthe happy Academician.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, a discordant note soon mingled in this concert. It even\r\nemanated from a pupil of Marsigli!\r\n\r\nJean André de Peyssonnel was born at Marseilles in 1694. He was a\r\nstudent of medicine and natural history at Paris when the Académie des\r\nSciences charged him with the task of studying the coral on the\r\nsea-shore. Peyssonnel began his observations in the neighbourhood of\r\nMarseilles in 1723. He pursued it on the North African coast, where he\r\nhad been sent on a mission by the Government. Aided by a long series of\r\nobservations as exact as they were delicate, Peyssonnel demonstrated\r\nthat the pretended flowers which the Count de Marsigli thought he had\r\ndiscovered in the coral, were true animals, and showed that the coral\r\nwas neither plant nor the product of a plant, but a being with life,\r\nwhich he placed in the first \"rung\" of the zoological ladder. \"I put the\r\nflower of the coral,\" says Peyssonnel, \"in vases full of sea-water, and\r\nI saw that what had been taken for a flower of this pretended plant was,\r\nin truth, only an insect, like a little sea-nettle, or polyp. I had the\r\npleasure of seeing removed the claws or feet of the creature, and having\r\nput the vase full of water, which contained the coral, in a gentle heat\r\nover the fire, all the small insects seemed to expand. The polyp\r\nextended his feet, and formed what M. de Marsigli and I had taken for\r\nthe petals of a flower. The calyx of this pretended flower, in short,\r\nwas the animal, which advanced and issued out of its cell.\"\r\n\r\nThe observations of Peyssonnel were calculated to put aside altogether\r\ntheories which had lately attracted universal admiration, but they were\r\ncoldly received by the naturalists, his contemporaries. Réaumur\r\ndistinguished himself greatly in his opposition to the young innovator.\r\nHe wrote to Peyssonnel in an ironical tone: \"I think (he says) as you\r\ndo, that no one has hitherto been disposed to regard the coral as the\r\nwork of insects. We cannot deny that this idea is both new and singular;\r\nbut the coral, as it appears to me, never could have been constructed by\r\nsea-nettles or polyps, if we may judge from the manner in which you make\r\nthem labour.\"\r\n\r\nWhat appeared impossible to Réaumur was, however, a fact which\r\nPeyssonnel had demonstrated to hundreds by his experiments at\r\nMarseilles. Nevertheless, Bernard de Jussieu did not find the reasons he\r\nurged strong enough to induce him to abandon the opinions he had formed\r\nas to their vegetable origin. Afflicted and disgusted at the indifferent\r\nsuccess with which his labours were received, Peyssonnel abandoned his\r\ninvestigations. He even abandoned science and society, and sought an\r\nobscure retirement in the Antilles as a naval surgeon, and his\r\nmanuscripts, which he left in France, have never been printed. These\r\nmanuscripts, written in 1744, were preserved in the library of the\r\nMuseum of Natural History at Paris. The title is comprehensive and\r\nsufficiently descriptive. It should be added, in order to complete the\r\nrecital, that Réaumur and Bernard de Jussieu finally recognized the\r\nvalue of the discoveries and the validity of the reasoning of the\r\nnaturalist of Marseilles. When these illustrious _savants_ became\r\nacquainted with the experiments of Trembley upon the fresh-water hydræ;\r\nwhen they had themselves repeated them; when they had made similar\r\nobservations on the sea anemone and alcyonidæ; when they finally\r\ndiscovered that on other so-called marine plants animalcules were found\r\nsimilar to the hydra, so admirably described by Trembley;--they no\r\nlonger hesitated to render full justice to the views of their former\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nWhile Peyssonnel still lived forgotten at the Antilles, his scientific\r\nlabours were crowned with triumph at Paris; but it was a sterile triumph\r\nfor him. Réaumur gave to the animalcules which construct the coral the\r\nname of _Polyps_, and _Coral_ to the product itself, for such he\r\nconsidered the architectural product of the polyps. In other words,\r\nRéaumur introduced into Science the views which he had keenly contested\r\nwith their author. But from that time the animal nature of the coralline\r\nhas never been doubted.\r\n\r\nWithout pausing to note the various authors who have given their\r\nattention to this fine natural production, we shall at once direct our\r\nattention to the organization of the animalcules, and the construction\r\nof the coral.\r\n\r\nM. Lacaze-Duthiers, professor at the Jardin des Plantes of Paris,\r\npublished in 1864 a remarkable monograph, entitled \"L'Histoire Naturelle\r\ndu Corail.\" This learned naturalist was charged by the French\r\nGovernment, in 1860, with a mission having for its object the study of\r\nthe coral from the natural history point of view. His observations upon\r\nthe zoophytes are numerous and precise, and worthy of the successor of\r\nPeyssonnel; but for close observation, practical conclusions, and\r\npopular exposition, the world is more indebted to Charles Darwin than to\r\nany other naturalist.\r\n\r\nA branch of _living_ coral, if we may use the term, is an aggregation of\r\nanimals derived from a first being by budding. They are united among\r\nthemselves by a common tissue, each seeming to enjoy a life of its own,\r\nthough participating in a common object. The branch seems to originate\r\nin an egg, which produces a young animal, which attaches itself soon\r\nafter its birth, as already described. From this is derived the new\r\nbeings which, by their united labours, produce the branch of coral or\r\npolypidom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47. Living Bed of Coral after the entrance of the\r\nPolyps.\r\n\r\n(Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nThis branch is composed of two distinct parts: the one central, of a\r\nhard, brittle, and stony nature, the well-known coral of commerce; the\r\nother altogether external, like the bark of a tree, soft and fleshy, and\r\neasily impressed with the nail. This is essentially the bed of the\r\nliving colony. The first is called the polypidom, the second is the\r\ncolony of polyps. This bed (Fig. 47) is much contracted when the water\r\nis withdrawn from the colony. It is covered with salient mammals or\r\nprotuberances, much wrinkled and furrowed.\r\n\r\nEach protuberance encloses a polyp, and presents on its summit eight\r\nfolds, radiating round a central pore, which presents a star-like\r\nappearance. This pore as it opens gives to the polyps the opportunity of\r\ncoming out. Its edge presents a reddish calyx, like the rest of the\r\nbark, the festooned throat of which presents eight dentations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48. Three Polyps of the Coral. (Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nThe polyp itself (Fig. 48) is formed of a whitish membranous tube,\r\nnearly cylindrical, having an upper disk, surrounded by its eight\r\ntentacula, bearing many delicate fibres spreading out laterally. This\r\nassemblage of tentacula resembles the corolla of some flowers; its form\r\nis very variable, but always truly elegant. Fig. 49 (which is borrowed\r\nfrom M. Lacaze-Duthiers' great work) represents one of these forms of\r\nthe coral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49. Coral Polyp. (Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nThe arms of the polyps are at times subject to violent agitation: the\r\ntentacula become much excited. If this excitement continues, the\r\ntentacula can be seen to fold and roll themselves up, as shown in Fig.\r\n50. If we look at the expanded disk, we see that the eight tentacula\r\nattach themselves to the body, describing a space perfectly circular, in\r\nthe middle of which rises a small mammal, the summit of which is\r\noccupied by a small slit like two rounded lips. This is the mouth of the\r\npolyps, the form being very variable, but well represented in Fig. 50,\r\nwhere the organ under consideration is displayed.\r\n\r\nA cylindrical tube connected with the mouth represents the oesophagus or\r\ngullet; but all other portions of the digestive tube are very\r\nrudimentary. The oesophagus connects the general cavity of the body with\r\nthe exterior, and looks as if it were suspended in the middle of the\r\nbody by certain folds, which issue with perfect symmetry from eight\r\npoints of its circumference. The folds which thus fix the oesophagus\r\nform a series of cells, above each of which it attaches itself, and\r\nsupports an arm or tentaculum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50. Another form of the Coral Polyp.\r\n(Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nLet us pause an instant over the soft and fleshy bark in which the\r\npolyps are engaged. Let us see also what are the mutual relations which\r\nexist between the several inhabitants of one of these colonies, how they\r\nare attached to one another, and what is their connection with the\r\npolypidom.\r\n\r\nThe thick fleshy body, soft, and easily impressed with the finger, is\r\nthe living part which produces the coral; it extends itself so as\r\nexactly to cover the whole polypidom. If it perishes at any one point,\r\nthat part of the axis which corresponds with the point no longer shows\r\nany increase. An intimate relation, therefore, exists between the bark\r\nand the polypidom. If the bark is examined more closely, three principal\r\nelements are recognized--a common general _tissue_, some _spicula_, and\r\ncertain _vessels_. The general tissue is transparent, glossy, cellular,\r\nand contractile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51. Coralline Spicula. (Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nThe _spiculæ_ are very small calcareous concretions, more or less\r\nelongated, covered with knotted joints bristling with spines, and of\r\nregular determinate form (Fig. 51). They refract the light very vividly,\r\nand their colour is that of the coral, but much weaker, in consequence\r\nof their want of thickness. They are uniformly distributed throughout\r\nthe bark, and give to the coral the fine colour which generally\r\ncharacterises it.\r\n\r\nThe vessels constitute a network, which extends and repeats itself in\r\nthe thickness of the crust. These vessels are of two kinds (Fig. 52);\r\nthe one, comparatively very large, is imbedded in the axis, and disposed\r\nin parallel layers; the others are regular and much smaller. They form a\r\nnetwork of unequal meshes, which occupies the whole thickness of the\r\nexternal crust. This network has direct and important connection with\r\nthe polyps on the one hand, and with the central substance which forms\r\nthe axis on the other. It communicates directly with the general cavity\r\nof the body of the animal, by every channel which approaches it, while\r\nthe two ranges of network approach each other by a great number of\r\nanastomosing processes. Such is the vascular arrangement of the coral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52. Circulating Apparatus for the nutritive fluids\r\nin the Coral. (Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nThe circulation of alimentary fluids in the coral is accomplished by\r\nmeans of vessels near to the axis, without, however, directly\r\nanastomosing with the cavities containing the polyps which live in the\r\npolypidom; they only communicate with those cavities by very delicate\r\nintermediary canals. The alimentary fluids they receive from the\r\nsecondary system of network, which brings them into direct communication\r\nwith the polyps. The alimentary fluids elaborated by the polyps pass\r\ninto the branches of the secondary and irregular network system, in\r\norder to reach the great parallel tubes which extend from one extremity\r\nof the organism to the other, serving the same purpose to the whole\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nWhen the extremity of a branch of living coral is torn or broken, a\r\nwhite liquid immediately flows from the wound, which mingles with water,\r\nand presents all the appearance of milk. This is the fluid aliment which\r\nhas escaped from the vessel containing it, charged with the débris of\r\nthe organism.\r\n\r\nWhat occurs when the bud produces new polyps? It is only round\r\nwell-developed animals, and particularly those with branching\r\nextremities, in which this phenomenon is produced. The new beings\r\nresemble little white points pierced with a central orifice. Aided by\r\nthe microscope, we discover that this white point is starred with\r\nradiating white lines, the edge of the orifice bearing eight\r\ndistinctly-traced indentations. All these organs are enlarged step by\r\nstep until the young animal has attained the shrub-like or branched\r\naspect which belongs to the compound polypidom. The tube is branching,\r\nand the orifices from which the polypi expand become dilated into\r\ncup-like cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53. Section of a Branch of Coral.\r\n(Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nThe coral of commerce, so beautiful and so appreciated by lovers of\r\nbijouterie, is the polypidom. It is cylindrical, much channeled on the\r\nsurface, the lines usually parallel to the axis of the cylinder, the\r\ndepressions sometimes corresponding to the body of the animal. If the\r\ntransverse section of a polypidom be examined, it is found to be\r\nregularly festooned on its circumference. Towards its centre certain\r\nsinuosities appear, sometimes crossing, sometimes trigonal, sometimes in\r\nirregular lines, and in the remaining mass are reddish folds alternating\r\nwith brighter spaces which radiate from the centre towards the\r\ncircumference (Fig. 53). In the section of a very red coral, it will be\r\nobserved that the colour is not equally distributed, but separated into\r\nzones more or less deep in colour, containing very thin preparations\r\nwhich crack, not irregularly, but parallel to the edge of the plate, and\r\nin such a manner as to reproduce the festoons on the circumference. From\r\nthis it may be deduced that the stem increases by concentric layers\r\nbeing deposited, which mould themselves one upon the other. In the mass\r\nof coral certain small corpuscles occur, charged with irregular\r\nasperities, much redder than the tissue into which they are plunged.\r\nThese are much more numerous in the red than in the light band, and they\r\nnecessarily give more strength to the general tint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54. Birth of the Coralline Larvæ.\r\n(Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nTo the mode of reproduction in the coral polyps, so well described by\r\nLacaze-Duthiers, we can only devote a few lines. Sometimes, according to\r\nthis able observer, the polyps of the same colony are all either male or\r\nfemale, and the branch is _unisexual_; in others there are both male and\r\nfemale, when the branch is _bisexual_. Finally, but very rarely, polyps\r\nare found uniting both sexes.\r\n\r\nThe coral is viviparous; that is to say, its eggs become embryos inside\r\nthe polyp. The larvæ remain a certain time in the general cavity of the\r\npolyp, where they can be seen through its transparency, as exhibited in\r\nFig. 54. Aided by the magnifying powers of the microscope, coral larvæ\r\nmay here be perceived through the transparent membranous envelope. From\r\nthis position they escape from the mouth of the mother in the manner\r\nrepresented in the upper branch. The animal then resembles a little\r\nwhite grub or worm, more or less elongated. The larva is, however, still\r\negg-shaped or ovoid; moreover, it is sunk in a hollow cavity, and\r\ncovered with cilia, by the aid of which it can swim. Sometimes one of\r\nits extremities becomes enlarged, the other remaining slender and\r\npointed. Upon this an opening is formed communicating with the interior\r\ncavity: this is the mouth. The larvæ swim backwards; that is to say,\r\nwith the mouth behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55. Very young Polyps, attached to a Bryozoa.]\r\n\r\nIt is only at a certain period after birth that the coral polyp fixes\r\nitself and commences its metamorphoses, which consist essentially in a\r\nchange of form and proportions. The buccal extremity is diminished and\r\ntapers off, whilst the base swells, and is enlarged--it becomes discoid;\r\nthe posterior surface of this sort of disk is a plane, the front\r\nrepresenting the mouth, at the bottom of a depression edged with a great\r\ncushion. Eight mammillations or swellings now appear, corresponding to\r\nthe chambers which divide the interior of the disk: the worm has taken\r\nits radiate form. Finally, the mammals are elongated and transformed\r\ninto tentacula. In Fig. 55 a young coral polyp is represented fixed upon\r\na bryozoa, a name employed by Ehrenberg for zoophytes having a mouth and\r\nanus. It forms a small disk, the fortieth part of an inch in diameter,\r\nand having its spicula already coloured red. Fig. 56 shows the\r\nsuccessive forms of the young polyps in the progressive phases of their\r\ndevelopment--being a young coralline polyp fixed upon a rock still\r\ncontracted. Fig. 57 is a similar coralline attached to a rock and\r\nexpanding its tentacula. Fig. 58 represents a small pointed rock covered\r\nwith polypi and polypidoms of the natural size and of different shapes,\r\nbut all young, and indicating the definite form of development which\r\nthe collective beings are to assume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56. A young Coral Polyp fixed upon a Rock.\r\n(Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nThe simple isolated state of the animal, whose phases of development we\r\nhave indicated, does not last long. It possesses the property of\r\nproducing new beings, as we have already said, by budding. But how is\r\nthe polypidom formed? If we take a very young branch, we find in the\r\ncentre of the thickness of the crust a nucleus or stony substance\r\nresembling an agglomeration of spicula. When they are sufficient in\r\nnumber and size, these nuclei form a kind of stony plate, which is\r\nimbedded in the thickness of the tissues of the animal. These _laminæ_,\r\nat first quite flat, assume in the course of their development a\r\nhorse-shoe shape. Figs. 59 and 60 will give the reader some idea of the\r\nform in which the young present themselves. Fig. 59 represents the\r\ncorpuscles in which the polypidom has its origin; Fig. 60, the\r\nrudimentary form of the coralline polypidom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57. Young Coral Polyp attached to a Rock and\r\nexpanded. (Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nOur information fails to convey any precise notion of the time necessary\r\nfor the coral to acquire the various proportions in which it presents\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58. A Rock covered with young Polyps and Polypidom.\r\n(Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nDarwin, who examined some of these creatures very minutely, tells us\r\nthat \"several genera\" (Flustræ, Escharæ, Cellaria, Cresia, and others)\r\nagree in having singular movable organs attached to their cells. The\r\norgans in the greater number of cases very closely resemble the head of\r\na vulture; but the lower mandible can be opened much wider than a real\r\nbird's beak. The head itself possesses considerable powers of movement,\r\nby means of a short neck. In one zoophyte the head itself was fixed, but\r\nthe lower jaw free; in another it was replaced by a triangular hood,\r\nwith a beautifully-fitted trap-door, which evidently answered to the\r\nlower mandible. In the greater number of species each cell was provided\r\nwith one head, but in others each cell had two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59. Corpuscles from which originate the Polypidom.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. First form of the Polypidom. (Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\n\"The young cells at the end of the branches of these corallines contain\r\nquite immature polypi, yet the vulture heads attached to them, though\r\nsmall, are in every respect perfect. When the polypus was removed by a\r\nneedle from any of the cells, these organs did not appear to be in the\r\nleast affected. When one of the vulture-like heads was cut off from a\r\ncell, the lower mandible retained its power of opening and closing.\r\nPerhaps the most singular part of their structure is, that when there\r\nare more than two rows of cells on a branch, the central cells were\r\nfurnished with these appendages of only one-fourth the size of the\r\noutside ones. Their movements varied according to the species; but in\r\nsome I never saw the least motion, while others, with the lower mandible\r\ngenerally wide open, oscillated backwards and forwards at the rate of\r\nabout five seconds each turn; others moved rapidly and by starts. When\r\ntouched with a needle, the beak generally seized the point so firmly\r\nthat the whole branch might be shaken.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Cresia_, Darwin observed that each cell was furnished with a\r\nlong-toothed bristle, which had the power of moving very quickly; each\r\nbristle and each vulture-like head moving quite independently of each\r\nother; sometimes all on one side, sometimes those on one branch only\r\nmoving simultaneously, sometimes one after the other. In these actions\r\nwe apparently behold as perfect a transmission of will in the zoophyte,\r\nthough composed of thousands of distinct polyps, as in any distinct\r\nanimal. \"What can be more remarkable,\" he adds, \"than to see a\r\nplant-like body producing an egg, capable of swimming about and choosing\r\na proper place to adhere to, where it sprouts out into branches, each\r\ncrowded with innumerable distinct animals, often of complicated\r\norganization!--the branches, moreover, sometimes possessing organs\r\ncapable of movement independent of the polypi.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPassing to the coral fishing, it may be said to be quite special,\r\npresenting no analogy with any other fishing in the European seas, if we\r\nexcept the sponge fisheries. The fishing stations which occur are found\r\non the Italian coast and the coast of Barbary; in short, in most parts\r\nof the Mediterranean basin. In all these regions, on abrupt rocky beds,\r\ncertain aquatic forests occur, composed entirely of the red coral, the\r\nmost brilliant and the most celebrated of all the corals, _Coralium\r\ndecus liquidi_! During many ages, as we have seen, the coral was\r\nsupposed to be a plant. The ancient Greeks called it the _daughter of\r\nthe sea_ (Κορύλλιου κόρη ἁλός), which the Latins\r\ntranslated into _corralium_ or _coralium_. It is now agreed among\r\nnaturalists that the coral is constructed by a family of polyps living\r\ntogether, and composing a polypidom. It abounds in the Mediterranean\r\nand the Red Sea, where it is found at various depths, but rarely less\r\nthan five fathoms, or more than a hundred and fifty. Each polypidom\r\nresembles a pretty red leafless under shrub bearing delicate little\r\nstar-like radiating white flowers. The axes of this little tree are\r\nthe parts common to the association, the flowrets are the polypi.\r\nThese axes present a soft reticulated crust, full of little cavities,\r\nwhich are the cells of the polyps, and are permeated by a milky juice.\r\nBeneath the crust is the coral, properly so called, which equals marble\r\nin hardness, and is remarkable for its striped surface, its bright red\r\ncolour, and the fine polish of which it is susceptible. The ancients\r\nbelieved that it was soft in the water, and only took its consistence\r\nwhen exposed to the air:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sic et coralium, quo primum contigit auras\r\n    Tempore, durescit.\"\r\n\r\n    OVID.\r\n\r\nThe fishing is chiefly conducted by sailors from Genoa, Leghorn, and\r\nNaples, and it is so fatiguing, that it is a common saying in Italy that\r\na sailor obliged to go to the coral fishery should be a thief or an\r\nassassin. The saying is a gratuitous insult to the sailor, but conveys a\r\ngood idea enough of the occupation.\r\n\r\nThe barks sent to the fishing range from six to fifteen tons; they are\r\nsolid, and well adapted for the labour; their rig is a great lateen\r\nsail, and a jib or staysail. The stern is reserved for the capstan, the\r\nfishers, and the crew. The fore part of the vessel is reserved for the\r\nrequirements of the patron or master.\r\n\r\nThe lines, wood, and irons employed in the coral fisheries are called\r\nthe _engine_: it consists of a cross of wood formed of two bars,\r\nstrongly lashed or bolted together at their centre; below this a great\r\nstone is attached, which bears the lines, arranged in the form of a sac.\r\nThese lines have great meshes, loosely knotted together, resembling the\r\nwell-known swab.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus carries thirty of these sacs, which are intended to\r\ngrapple all they come in contact with at the bottom of the sea. They are\r\nspread out in all directions by the movement of the boat. The coral is\r\nknown to attach itself to the summit of a rock and to develop itself,\r\nforming banks there, and it is to these rocks that the swab attaches\r\nitself so as to tear up the precious harvest. Experience, which in time\r\nbecomes almost intuitive, guides the Italian fisher in discovering the\r\ncoral banks. The craft employed in the great fishery have a \"patron\" or\r\ncaptain, the bark having a poop, with a crew of eight or ten sailors,\r\nand in the season it is continued night and day. The whole apparatus,\r\nand mode of using it, is shown in PL. III.\r\n\r\nWhen the patron thinks that he has reached a coral bank, he throws his\r\nengine overboard. As soon as the apparatus is engaged, the speed of the\r\nvessel is retarded, the capstan is manned by six or eight men, while the\r\nothers guide the helm and trim the sails. Two forces are thus brought to\r\nact upon the lines, the horizontal action of the vessel and the vertical\r\naction of the capstan. In consequence of the many inequalities of the\r\nrocky bottom, the engine advances by jerks, the vessel yielding more or\r\nless, according to the concussion caused by the action of the capstan or\r\nsail. The engine seizes upon the rugged rocks at the bottom, and raises\r\nthem to let them fall again. In this manner the swab, floating about,\r\npenetrates beneath the rocks where the coral is found, and is hooked on\r\nto it. To fix the lines upon the coral and bring them home, is a work of\r\nunheard-of labour. The engine long resists the most energetic and\r\nrepeated efforts of the crew, who, exposed almost naked to the burning\r\nsun of the Mediterranean, work the capstan to which the cable and engine\r\nare attached, while the patron urges and excites them to increased\r\nexertion, and the sailors trim the sail and sing with a slow and\r\nmonotonous tone a song, the words of which improvise in a sort of\r\npsalmody the names of the saints most revered among the seafaring\r\nItalian population.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate III.--Coral Fishing on the Coast of Sicily.]\r\n\r\nThe lines are finally brought home, tearing or breaking blocks of rock,\r\nsometimes of enormous size, which are brought on board. The cross is now\r\nplaced on the side of the vessel, the lines are arranged on the deck,\r\nand the crew occupy themselves in gathering the results of their labour.\r\nThe coral is gathered together, the branches of the precious zoophyte\r\nare cleansed, and divested of the shells and other parasitic products\r\nwhich accompany them; finally, the produce is carried to and sold in the\r\nports of Messina, Naples, Genoa, or Leghorn, where the workers in\r\njewellery purchase them. Behold, fair reader, with what hard labour,\r\nfatigue, and peril, the elegant bijouterie with which you are decked is\r\ntorn from the deepest bed of the ocean!\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE PENNATULIDÆ, OR SEA-PEN.\r\n\r\nThis curious family received from Cuvier the name of _Swimming Polypi_,\r\nand from Lamarck that of _Floating Polypi_. The name of Pennatulæ, by\r\nwhich they are generally known, is taken from their resemblance to a\r\nquill, _penna_. In the words of Lamarck, \"It seems as if Nature, in\r\nforming this composite animal, had wished to copy the external form of a\r\nbird's feather.\" Our fishermen call it the _cock's comb_, which is not\r\ninapt, but less expressive of its peculiarities. This animal is \"from\r\ntwo to four inches in length, of a uniform purplish-red colour, except\r\nat the hip or base of the stalk, where it is pale orange-yellow; the\r\nskin is thickish, very tough, and of a curious structure, being composed\r\nof minute crystalline cylinders, densely arranged in straight lines, and\r\nheld together by a tenacious glutinous matter, the cylinders being about\r\nsix inches in diameter, in length straight and even, or sometimes\r\nslightly curved, and of a red colour, which communicates itself to the\r\nzoophyte.\" (Johnston.) The animals by which it is formed constitute\r\ncolonies, which, however, are only attached to the rocks by an enlarged\r\nbasis; it appears to live generally at the bottom of the sea; its root,\r\nif we can use the term, buried in the sands or mud; its polypiferous\r\nportion sallying out into the water. The agitation of the waves and the\r\nfishermen's nets often displace these aggregates of creation, and then\r\nthey float at various depths in the bosom of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe stalk of the polypidom is hollow in the centre, having a long\r\nslender bone-like substance, which is white, smooth, and square, but\r\ntapering at each extremity to a fine point. The polyps, which are fleshy\r\nand white, are provided with eight long retractile tentacula,\r\nbeautifully ciliated on their inner edge with two series of short\r\nprocesses strengthened with crystalline spicula. The mouth in the centre\r\nof the tentacula is somewhat angular, bounded by a white ligament, a\r\nprocess from which encircles the base of each tentaculum, which thus\r\nseems to issue from an aperture. The ova lie between the membranes of\r\nthe pinnæ; they are globular, of a yellowish colour, and by a little\r\npressure can be made to pass through the mouth. The polyps are\r\ndistributed with more or less regularity in such a manner that one of\r\nthe extremities of the common axis is always naked: this part has been\r\ncompared to the tubulous part of a feather. The stem, common to the\r\ncolony, is a solid central axis, more or less developed, which is\r\ncovered with a fleshy fibrous substance, susceptible of dilatation and\r\ncontraction.\r\n\r\nThe _Pennatulidæ_ comprehend three genera; namely, those with polyps on\r\nbipinnate wings, having--according to Dr. Johnston--\r\n\r\n    Polypidoms plumose, in                  Pennatula.\r\n    Polypidoms virgate, or wand-shaped      Virgularia.\r\n    Polypi, unilateral and sessile        }\r\n    Polypidom, linear-elongate.           } Pavonaria.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Pennatula_, the polyps are disposed in transverse rows\r\nupon the outer and inner edge, in a series of prolongations in the form\r\nof a feather. These winged species of polypidom are somewhat\r\nscythe-shaped, well developed, and furnished with a great quantity of\r\npointed spiculæ, which are constituted of bundles at the base of the\r\ncalyx. The space between the two rows of appendages is sometimes a\r\ntissue, sometimes scaly, sometimes granulous. Of the _Pennatula_ five\r\nspecies are known, and all of them appear to be gifted with\r\nphosphorescent properties. We may note among these species _Pennatula\r\nspinosa_ (Fig. 61), which inhabits the Mediterranean, and takes its name\r\nfrom its colour; _Pennatula phosphorea_, which abound in most European\r\nseas, being found in great plenty, clinging to the fishermen's lines\r\nround our own northern shores, more especially when they are baited with\r\nmussels.\r\n\r\n_P. phosphorea_ is of a reddish purple, the base of the smooth stalk\r\npale; the raches roughened with close-set papillæ, and furrowed down\r\nthe middle; pinnæ close; polyp cilia uniserial, tubular, with spinous\r\napertures. (Sibbald.)\r\n\r\nBohadsch says the _Pennatulæ_ swim by means of their pinnæ, which they\r\nuse as fishes do their fins. Ellis says, \"It is an animal that swims\r\nabout in the sea, many of them having a muscular motion as they swim\r\nalong;\" these motions being effected, as he tells us in another place,\r\nby means of the pinnules or feather-like fins, \"evidently designed by\r\nNature to move the animal backward or forward in the sea.\" Cuvier tells\r\nus they have the power of moving by the contraction of the fleshy part\r\nof the polypidom, and also by the combined action of its polyps. Dr.\r\nGrant says, \"A more singular and beautiful spectacle could scarcely be\r\nconceived than that of a deep purple _P. phosphorea_ with all its\r\ndelicate transparent polypi expanded, and emitting their usual brilliant\r\nphosphorescent light, sailing through the still and dark abyss, by the\r\nregular and synchronous pulsations of the minute fringed arms of the\r\nwhole polypi;\" while Linnæus tells us that \"the phosphorescent sea-pens\r\nwhich cover the bottom of the ocean cast so strong a light, that it is\r\neasy to count the fishes and worms of various kinds which sport among\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61. Sea-pen, Pennatula spinosa. (Edes.)]\r\n\r\nLamarck, Schweigger, and other naturalists, however, reasoning from what\r\nis known of other compound animals, deny the existence of this\r\nlocomotive power in these zoophytes; \"and there is little doubt,\" says\r\nDr. Johnston, \"that these authors are right, for, when placed in a basin\r\nof sea water, the _Pennatulæ_ are never observed to change their\r\nposition; they remain in the same spot, and lie with the same side up or\r\ndown, just as they have been placed. They inflate the body until it\r\nbecomes to a considerable degree transparent, and only streaked with\r\nintercepted lines of red, which distend at one place and contract at\r\nanother; they spread out the pinnæ, and the polyps expand their\r\ntentacula, but they never attempt to swim, or perform any process of\r\nlocomotion.\"\r\n\r\n_P. mirabilis_ is common in the east and north coasts of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe _virgularias_ differ from the _pennatula_ chiefly in their\r\ndevelopment, relative to the axis of the colony and the shortness of the\r\npinnæ, which carry the polyps; and in this, that no spiculæ enter into\r\nthe composition of its softer parts. _V. mirabilis_ is found in the\r\nNorth Sea, on the coast of Scotland, and as far north as Norway. In\r\nZetland it is known as the sea-rush. It is abundant in Belfast Lough,\r\nbut, from its brittle nature, perfect specimens are difficult to obtain.\r\n\r\n\"It seems,\" says Sowerby, \"to represent a quill stripped of its\r\nfeathers. The base looks like a pen in this as in other species,\r\nswelling a little way from the end, and then tapering. The upper part is\r\nthicker, with alternate semicircular pectinated swellings, larger\r\ntowards the middle, tapering upwards, and terminating in a thin bony\r\nsubstance, which passes through the whole extent, and is from six to ten\r\ninches in length.\"\r\n\r\nIn a communication to Dr. Johnston, from Mr. R. Patterson of Belfast,\r\ncommenting on Müller's figure of _Virgularia_, he tells us that in the\r\nlongest specimen he had, no two plumes were precisely alike--so unlike,\r\nindeed, that the artist copying one, could not for a moment hesitate,\r\nafter raising her eyes from her paper, to look at the animal, as to\r\nwhich she was copying.\r\n\r\nIts short waving and deeply dentated wings are of a brilliant yellow.\r\nThe polyps, which appear upon their lobes, are whitish, transparent, and\r\nform a fringe of small diaphanous white stars (Figs. 62 and 63). We may\r\nfigure to ourselves a slender wand-like and much-elongated polypidom,\r\ncarrying only a non-contractile polyp on one side, which would give us\r\nan idea of the Pavonaria, of which we know only one species, which is\r\nfrom the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n_Virgularia mirabilis_ is undoubtedly one of the finest polypidoms found\r\nin the ocean. Two series of half-moon shaped wings, obliquely\r\nhorizontal, are placed symmetrically round an upright axis. They embrace\r\nthe stem somewhat in the manner termed _petiolate_ by botanists,\r\nclasping it alternately; or, shall we say, like two broad ribbons rolled\r\nround a stem in an inverse direction, in such a manner as to produce\r\nthe effect of two opposing flights of stairs. These wings are waving,\r\nvandyked, and fringed on their outer edge, and of a brilliant yellow;\r\nthe dentature of the fringe being the lodging of their pretty little\r\npolyps, which display occasionally their gaping mouths and expanded\r\ngills. The polyps are white and semi-transparent. When they display\r\ntheir rays, the margin of each wing presents an edging of silvery stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62. Loose-winged Virgularia, Virgularia mirabilis\r\n(Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63. Branch of Virgularia, enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe _Umbellularia_ have a very long stem, supported by a bone (Fig. 64)\r\nof the same length, and terminated at the summit only by a cluster of\r\npolyps. They have been found in the Greenland and other northern seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64. Umbellularia Greculandrea (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe _Veretillum_, which inhabit the Mediterranean (Fig. 65), have a\r\nsimple cylindrical body, without branchiæ, and a rudimentary polypidom,\r\nfurnished with very large polyps of a whitish colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE ALCYONARIA PROPER.\r\n\r\nThe beings which compose this group have the fleshy polypidom always\r\nadherent, without axis or solid interior stem. They are divided into\r\nfour families or tribes. One of these, the _Cornularia_, are zoophytes,\r\nand live in isolation, or gathered together in small numbers on the\r\nsurface of a common membraniform expansion. The _Cornularia cornucopia_\r\nlive on the coast of Naples, _C. crassa_ on the Algerian coast. Other\r\ngenera make their appearance on the coast of Scotland, of Norway, in the\r\nRed Sea, and in the Indian Ocean they appear in great numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65. Veretillum cynomorium (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nIn the _Alcyonaria_, properly so called, the polypidom is very thick, of\r\na semi-cartilaginous consistence, granular, and rough to the touch.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Alcyonium_ is numerous in species and widely dispersed. _A.\r\ndigitatum_ is very common on our coasts, and on many parts of the coast\r\nscarcely a stone or shell is dredged up from deep water which does not\r\nserve as a support to some one or more species of _Alcyonium_. It is\r\nknown by various popular names by our sea-side population, such as\r\n_cow's paps_, from its resemblance to the teats of the cow--_dead man's\r\nfingers_, from the occasional resemblance of its finger-like lobes to a\r\nman's fingers.\r\n\r\nThe polypidom is a simple obtuse process, the outer skin of which is\r\ntough and coriaceous, studded all over with star-like figures, which on\r\nexamination are found to be divided into eight rays, indicating the\r\nnumber of the polyps enclosed in its transparent vesicular membrane. It\r\nis dotted with minute calcareous grains, and marked with eight\r\nlongitudinal lines or septa, stretching between the membrane and the\r\ncentral stomach, which divide the intermediate space into an equal\r\nnumber of compartments. These lines not only extend to the base of the\r\ntentacula, but run across the anal disk, and terminate in a central\r\nmouth. The tentacula are short, obtuse, ciliate on the margins, and\r\nstrengthened at their roots by numerous crystalline spiculæ. The polyp\r\ncells are oval, placed just under the skin, and are the terminating\r\npoints of certain long canals which traverse the whole polypidom. The\r\npolyps, which are distributed over the whole surface, can withdraw into\r\nthe cavities; they are, besides, of an extremely vital sensibility: the\r\nleast shock impresses itself on the tentacula, the impulse of a wave\r\neven producing contraction; in response, the animal, which is well\r\ndeveloped, sallies out perceptibly, but immediately retires again to\r\nhide itself in the cell.\r\n\r\nWe find on the coast, in the Channel, and in the North Sea, _Alcyonium\r\ndigitatum_, the mass of which is of a reddish white, ferruginous, or\r\norange; _A. stellatum_, found on the shores of the Mediterranean, is\r\nexpanded in its upper part, narrow towards its base, very rough on the\r\nsurface, and rose-coloured; _A. palmatum_, is cylindrical, branching at\r\nthe summit, of a deep red, except at the base, where it is yellow: this\r\nis met with in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nWe may note as a type, altogether different from any yet touched upon,\r\nthe _Nephtys_, in which the polypidom is a coriaceous tissue bristling\r\nwith spiculæ over its whole surface. In _N. Chabroli_, the polypidom is\r\nsquat, with thick spreading arms covered with lobiliform branches, the\r\ntubercular polypidom of which are columnar and obtuse, the sicula green,\r\nand the tentacula of the polyps yellow.\r\n\r\n\"On a cursory view,\" says Dr. Johnston, \"the polypodium of the three\r\nfamilies embraced appear very dissimilar, and accordingly, by many\r\nrecent authors, they have been scattered over the class, and placed\r\nwidely asunder. The affinity between them, however, is generally\r\nacknowledged, and had been distinctly perceived by some of the earliest\r\nzoophytologists. Thus Bohadsch found so much in common in the typical\r\npennatulæ and a species of _Alcyonium_, that he has not hesitated to\r\ndescribe them as members of the same genus; and, although the more\r\nsystematic character of Pallas prevented him from falling into this\r\nerror, if error it can be called, he did not the less recognize the\r\nrelationship between the genera or families. Pallas also tells us that\r\nhis _Pennatula cynomorium_ differs from the _Alcyonium_ only in this,\r\nthat the former is a movable and the latter a fixed polypidom; and he\r\nsaw with equal clearness the connection which exists between these\r\ngenera and the shrub-like _Gorgonia_. Of the _Pennatula mirabilis_ he\r\nhad doubts whether it was not rather a species of _Gorgonia_, until he\r\nperceived that the stem was attenuated at each end, and free; and of the\r\nSea-pens generally, Ellis remarks that they are 'a genus of zoophytes\r\nnot far removed from the _Gorgonias_, on account of their polyp mouths,\r\nas well as having a bone in the inside and flesh without.' 'On the other\r\nhand, the _Gorgoniæ_ seem,' says Pallas, 'with the exception of their\r\nhorny skeleton, to be nearly similar in structure to the _Alcyonia_; but\r\nas there are species of _Gorgonia_ which are suberose internally, and\r\nalmost of a uniform medullary consistence, even this mark of distinction\r\nfails to separate the tribes, and we have little left to guide us in\r\narranging these esculent species excepting their external habits.'\"\r\n\r\n\"With most corallines,\" says Frédol, \"the elementary individual, in\r\nspite of the adhesion established among them, possesses a vital energy\r\nall its own; it is in some respects quite independent. They have each\r\nits own particular will, which it is difficult to mistake for a common\r\nwill; but it is not thus with the _Pennatula_. Their association\r\nconsists of a non-adherent polyp, which moves--obscurely, it is\r\ntrue--but still it moves. To what does this lead? To this: that the\r\nparts which they possess in common, in place of being horny or\r\ncalcareous--that is, completely inert--are fleshy, with contractile\r\npowers; that is to say, animated. Consequently, the polyp of the\r\n_Pennatula_ are less independent of each other than the coral polyp,\r\nwhich have a central, perhaps a sensible organ, common to all, which\r\nbinds them to each other, giving a certain unity to their acts. The\r\nCoralline polyps have no will; the _Pennatula_ have.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nZOANTHARIA, OR ANIMAL FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n          \"I saw the living pile ascend\r\n    The mausoleum of its architects,\r\n    Still dying upwards as their labour closed:\r\n    Slime the material, but the slime was turned\r\n    To adamant by their petrific touch.\"\r\n\r\n    MONTGOMERY'S _Pelican Island_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe zoophytes which constitute the class _Zoantharia_ are quite great\r\npersonages. Some of them are eighteen or twenty inches long; at the same\r\ntime, others scarcely exceed the eighth part of an inch in length. They\r\nlive in all seas, and seem to have existed through many ages of the\r\nearth's history; they appear at an early geological period, and they\r\nhave performed an important part in its formation; we shall see that,\r\nwith great numbers of them, parts cut off from their bodies continue to\r\nlive and become new individuals.\r\n\r\nThe name of _Zoantharia_ was first given to the class by Gray; but here\r\nwe give it a somewhat wider signification, embracing under it the\r\nmadrepores and starred stones of Lasueur, who is reminded of a field\r\nenamelled with small flowers when he sees the little polyp of _Porites\r\nAstroïdes_ in full blow. \"But it is only,\" says Johnston, \"when they lie\r\nwith their upper disk expanded, and their tentacula displayed, that they\r\nsolicit comparison with the boasts of Flora; for, when contracted, the\r\npolyp of the madrepores conceal themselves in their calcareous cups, and\r\nthe actiniæ hide their beauty, assuming the shape of an obtuse cone or\r\nhemisphere of a fleshy consistence, or elongating themselves into a sort\r\nof flabby cylinder that indicates a state of relaxation and indolent\r\nrepose.\"\r\n\r\nThese zoophytes are flesh-eaters, and consume quantities truly\r\nprodigious, of animals such as the crustaceans, worms, and small fishes.\r\nThey are all marine, nearly all attached to the same spot for life, and\r\nthey live in colonies. Some few are isolated and live by themselves,\r\neither free or attached to the soil. They differ altogether from the\r\nanimals belonging to the _Alcyonaria_ by their disposal of, and mode of\r\nmultiplying, tentacula. These appendages in the _Zoantharia_ never\r\npresent the _bipinnate_ arrangement which is observable in the\r\n_Alcyonaria_. They are habitually simple, and, if they present\r\nramifications, these are only exceptional. In nearly every instance, the\r\ntentacles exist to the number of twelve, eighteen, twenty-four, and even\r\nlarger numbers, which form a sort of concentric crown to the animal.\r\n\r\n_Zoantha thalassanthos_ (Lesson), which has given its name to the group,\r\nconsists of large turf-like tufts of coral attached to a rock. Its\r\nanimalcules are packed closely together, and their expanded flower-like\r\nheads have a curious resemblance to a mass of flowers in full bloom.\r\nThey are borne on bending root-like stems of pure white, interlacing one\r\nwith the other, surmounted by a fusiform or spindle-shaped body,\r\npediculate and swelling towards the middle, but truncate at the summit,\r\nof a reddish-brown colour, marked with longitudinal stripes more highly\r\ncoloured; its consistence is firm and parchment-like. From the body\r\nissues a tube, narrow, muscular, contractile, and red in colour,\r\nterminating at the summit in eight elongated arms or tentacula, of a\r\npure yellow, traversed by a nervure of the same colour. The edges of\r\nthese arms are fringed with fine pinnæ, parallel to each other, of a\r\nbright maroon colour, and resembling the barbs of a feather. According\r\nto Lesson, the arms of this _Zoantha_ are kept unceasingly in motion,\r\nwhich produces in the water small oscillating currents, in the course of\r\nwhich the animalcules on which the polyps feed are precipitated into the\r\nstream leading to their mouths.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to produce a calcareous polypidom is a property almost\r\nuniversal with animals of this class. Zoologists are agreed in dividing\r\nthem into three very distinct orders--namely, the ANTIPATHIDÆ,\r\nconsisting of the genera _Antipathes_, _Cirripathes_, and _Seipathes_,\r\nin which the polypidom is of a horny consistence; the MADREPORIDÆ, in\r\nwhich the polypidom is calcareous and stony; finally, the ACTINIDÆ,\r\nwhich produce no polypidom.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIPATHIDÆ.\r\n\r\nWe need not dwell upon this group, which is comparatively uninteresting.\r\nThey correspond with the family of _Gorgonidæ_ among the _Alcyonaria_,\r\nwhich they resemble in having the central axes branching after the\r\nmanner of a shrub; but the polyps have the mouth surrounded with a crown\r\nof six simple tentacula. The axis is of a harder and denser tissue than\r\nthat of the Gorgons, and presents on its surface small spiniform\r\nprojections. The polypiferous crust, with which they are covered, is in\r\ngeneral very arenaceous, and is so easily detached, that it is rare to\r\nsee in collections anything but the denuded skeleton of the colony. In\r\n_A. arborea_, the polypidom is fragile and brittle; when dry, the\r\nbranches, always slender and delicate, resemble the barbs of a feather.\r\nThe colour is of a deep black, or rather bistre and _terra de sienna_\r\ntint. Under a powerful lens, the extremities of the branches appear to\r\nbe covered with small spines, and the trunk is formed of oval and\r\nirregular concentric beds, which are the zones of growth. Its\r\nconsistence is firm, so that it can be worked up and converted into\r\nchaplets for pearls and other bijouterie: it is known in commerce as\r\n_black coral_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMADREPORIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe _Madrepora_ are better known than their congeners. They are\r\nsometimes, but erroneously, designated corals, since the coral forms no\r\npart of this group.\r\n\r\nThe Madrepores are remarkable for the calcareous crust which always\r\nsurrounds their tissue, and determines the formation of their polypidom.\r\nThey are in other respects easily recognized by the star-like structure\r\nof their polypidom, in which may always be distinguished a visceral\r\nchamber, the circumference of which is furnished with perpendicular\r\nlaminæ or partitions, which are always directed towards the axis of the\r\nbody. When sufficiently developed they constitute, by their assemblage,\r\na star-like body formed of a great number of rays. The polypidom is\r\nalways calcareous. The consolidation of the envelope of each polyp\r\nproduces at first a kind of sheath, to which Milne Edwards has given the\r\nname of the wall. The partitions which proceed from the interior towards\r\nthe axis of the visceral chamber occupy the subtentacular cells; the\r\nterminal and open portion designated the calyx is in organic continuity\r\nwith the polyp, which has retired thither more or less completely as\r\ninto a cell.\r\n\r\nMilne Edwards remarks that the polypidom of the _Madrepora_ present in\r\ntheir structure five principal modifications, due in part to the\r\nfundamental number of which the chambered cells are the multiple, and in\r\npart to the mode of division in the visceral chamber, and finally to the\r\nmanner in which its tissue is constituted. M. Edwards avails himself of\r\nthis peculiarity of structure in order to divide the Madrepores into\r\nfixed sections; namely, _Madrépores apores_, _Madrépores perforés_,\r\n_Madrépores tabulés_, _Madrépores tuberleux_, and _Madrépores rugueux_.\r\nIn the group of Aporous Madrepores, the polypidom is perhaps the most\r\nhighly organized. We find there a well-developed and very perfect wall,\r\nand a well-developed visceral apparatus. The calyx is neatly starred;\r\nthe number of rays in the earlier stages being six, which soon\r\nafterwards reach from twelve to twenty-four. The cells between the\r\nchambers are sometimes open in all their depth, sometimes more or less\r\nshut up by transverse plates; these, being independent of each other,\r\nare never reunited in the breadth of the visceral cavity, so that they\r\nconstitute discoid plates such as we find in _tabular_ and _rugose_\r\nMadrepores.\r\n\r\nThe animals belonging to this group, which may be characterised as\r\n_stelliform_ or star-like, are very abundant in every sea, and in\r\nseveral geological formations. They constitute many families, among\r\nwhich may be noted the MILLEPORINA of Ehrenberg, the polypidom of which\r\nDr. Johnston describes as \"calcareous, fixed, plant-like, branching or\r\nlobed, with cells scattered over the whole surface, distinct, sunk in\r\nlittle fosses, obscurely stellate, the lamellæ narrow and almost\r\nobsolete.\" (JOHNSTON'S _Zoophytes_, vol. i. p. 194.) In _Turbinolia_,\r\nthe animal is simple, conical, striped, furrowed externally with larger\r\nand smaller ribs, the mouth surrounded by numerous tentacula, and\r\nsolidified by a calcareous polypidom, which is free, conical, and also\r\nfurrowed externally; attenuated at the base, but enlarged at the summit,\r\nand terminating in a shallow radiated lamellar cup or cell. Several\r\nspecies have been dredged off the coast of Cornwall, and the west coast\r\nof Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\n_T. melletiana_ is described as coral-white, wedge-shaped, somewhat\r\ncompressed, with interspaces or ribs equidistant, smooth, and glossy.\r\nAbove, the ribs turn over the edge, and are continued into the centre of\r\nthe enlarged cup, forming its lamellæ. \"That the zoophyte must have\r\nlived for some time after having become a movable thing, is proved,\"\r\nsays Dr. Johnston, \"by the ribs being continued beyond or round the\r\npoint of attachment.\" The specimen here described was dredged alive, and\r\nProfessor Forbes says of it that \"it is a most interesting and beautiful\r\nspecies, the more so as it is certainly identical with Defrance's\r\n_Turbinolia melletiana_, found in both the crag formations.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66. Caryophillia cyathus (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe _Caryophilliæ_ (Lamarck), from καρύα, a nut, and ϕύλλου,\r\na leaf, have the polypidom permanently fixed, simple, striated\r\nlongitudinally, and the summit hollowed into a lamellated star-like\r\ncup; the animal, actinia-like, is provided with a simple, or double\r\ncrown of tentacula, projecting from the surface of star-like,\r\ncylindrical, cone shaped cells. In _C. cyathus_ (Lamarck) (Fig. 66),\r\nwhich inhabits the Mediterranean, the polyps are of a greyish colour,\r\nthe tentacula streaked with black. The polypidom is erect and upright,\r\nsometimes cylindrical, and generally so firmly attached to the rock as\r\nto seem a part of it. The lamellæ are of three kinds: one large and\r\nprominent, between every pair of which there are three, sometimes five,\r\nsmaller ones, the centre one being divided into two portions forming\r\nan inner series. The lamellæ are arched entire and striated on the\r\nsides, whence the margin appears somewhat crenelated. \"It is found,\"\r\nsays Mr. Couch, \"of all sizes, from a mere speck to an inch in height.\r\nIn a very young state, it is sometimes found parasitical on _Alcyonium\r\ndigitatum_, on shells, and on the stalks of sea-weeds; but as these\r\nsubstances are very perishable, and offer no solid foundation, large\r\nspecimens are never found on them. In its young state the animal is\r\nnaked, and measures about the fifteenth of an inch in diameter, and\r\nabout the thirty-second of an inch in height. In the earliest state\r\nin which I have seen the calcareous polypidom, there were four small\r\nrays, which were free or unconnected down to the base; in others I\r\nhave noticed six primary rays, but in every case they were unconnected\r\nwith each other. Other rays soon make their appearance between those\r\nfirst formed; they are mere calcareous specks at first, but afterwards\r\nincrease in size. The first union of rays is observed as a small\r\ncalcareous rim at the base of the polyp, which afterwards increases in\r\nheight and diameter with the age of the animal.\"\r\n\r\nThe animals of this interesting polypidom are vividly described by Dr.\r\nColdstream, in a communication to Dr. Johnston, as he observed them at\r\nTorquay:--\r\n\r\n\"When the soft parts are fully expanded,\" he says, \"the appearance of\r\nthe whole animal closely resembles an actinia. When shrunk, they are\r\nalmost entirely hid amongst the radiating plates. They are found\r\npendent,\" he adds, \"from large boulders of sandstone, just at low-water\r\nmark. Sometimes they are dredged from the middle of the bay. Their\r\ncolour varies considerably. I have seen the soft parts white, yellowish,\r\norange-brown, reddish, and of a fine apple-green. The tentacula are\r\nusually paler.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Caryophilliæ_ are sometimes dredged from great depths; Professor\r\nTravers dredged one in eighty fathoms, and Dr. Johnston remarks that the\r\nexistence of an animal so vividly coloured at so great a depth is worthy\r\nof remark. \"When taken,\" says the professor, \"the animal was scarcely\r\nvisible, being contracted; when expanded, the disk was conspicuously\r\nmarked by two dentated circles of bright apple-green, the one marginal\r\nand outside the tentacula, the other at some distance from the\r\ntransverse and linear mouth. In the dark, the animal gave out a few dull\r\nflashes of phosphorescent light.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition, we may mention the assertion of Mr. Swainson, that _C.\r\nramea_, common in the Mediterranean, is occasionally found on the\r\nCornish coast; but Dr. Johnston thinks it improbable that it could have\r\nescaped the attention of Mr. Couch and Mr. Peach, had it been so.\r\n\r\nAs belonging to this family, we present here illustrations of _Flabellum\r\npavoninum_, Lesson (Fig. 67).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67. Flabellum pavoninum (Lesson).\r\n\r\n    1. Vertical position.\r\n    2. Upper edge, with its plates and median thread.\r\n    3. Form of the animal.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf the _Occulinæ_, the animal is unknown, but it is contained in regular\r\nround radiated cells, more or less prominent, and scattered on the\r\nsurface of a solid, compact, fixed tree-like coral. The individuals\r\ndispose themselves in ascending spiral lines, and appear to be regularly\r\ndispersed on the surface of the several branches. The typical species,\r\n_O. virginea_, formerly known as the White Coral, although it differs\r\nwidely in reality from the true Coral, both in its structure and by its\r\nstar-like polypiferous cells (Fig. 68), is found in the Mediterranean\r\nand also in the equatorial seas. Over the specimen we see (2) a portion\r\nof a branch magnified, in order that the reader may appreciate\r\nnumerically the form of polype over its cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68. Occulina virginea (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. Stylaster flabelliformis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe species formerly named _Occulina flabelliformis_, and which now\r\nbears the name of _Stylaster flabelliformis_, which is represented in\r\nFig. 69, will give an excellent idea of these arborescent zoophytes.\r\nThe polypidom is in the form of a fan, with many very unequal branches;\r\nthe larger branches are smooth, the middle-sized are covered with small\r\npoints. This fine zoophyte is found in the seas which surround the Isle\r\nof Bourbon and the Mauritius, a fine example of which is to be seen in\r\nthe collection of the Museum of Natural History of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRÆACEA.\r\n\r\nHow diversified are the forms of aquatic life! \"Nature revels in these\r\ndiversities,\" to paraphrase the saying of one of the ancient kings of\r\nFrance. Here are animals, the frame of which might have been designed by\r\na geometrician. They are called Star Corals (_Astrea_). Their\r\nresemblance to the well-known figure was too striking to escape the\r\nobservation of naturalists; but the organization of these creatures of\r\nthe ocean is far from being rigorously regular, for Nature rarely\r\nemploys perfectly straight lines, giving an evident preference to\r\ncircles and waving lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70. Astrea punctifera (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe _Astrea_ are inhabitants of the Indian Ocean, where they are found\r\nin a great variety of forms, which has led to their subdivision into\r\nmany genera by Messrs. Milne Edwards and J. Haime. The animals are\r\nshort, more or less cylindrical, with rounded mouth placed in the centre\r\nof a disk, covered with a few rather short tentacula; the cells are\r\nshallow, with radiating lamellæ in _Astrea punctifera_ (Fig. 70),\r\nforming by their union a many-formed coral, which often encrusts other\r\nbodies. In short, this polyp may be described as a parasite, for it\r\ngenerally attaches to some other bodies, and it is by no means unusual\r\nto meet with it attached even to shells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71. Meandrina cerebriformis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe _Meandrina_ differ from the _Astreas_ in having the surface hollowed\r\nout into shallow sinuous elongated cells, furnished on each side of the\r\nmesial line with hooked lamellæ, ending against one or other of the\r\nridges with separate valleys; the polypidom, which is calcareous, being\r\nfixed, simple, and inversely conical when young, and globular when old.\r\nThe animals have each a distinct mouth, and lateral series of short\r\ntentacula; they are contained in shallow cells, meeting at the base, and\r\nforming by their union long and tortuous hollows. _Meandrina\r\ncerebriformis_ (Fig. 71), so called from its resemblance to the folds of\r\nthe brain, is a native of the American Seas.\r\n\r\nThe _Fungia_, so called by Lamarck from their resemblance to the\r\nvegetable Fungi, are too remarkable in their appearance to be passed\r\nover in silence. The major part of the species only occur in recent\r\ngeological strata. Nevertheless some of the species were very numerous\r\nin the Cretaceous period, and even find representatives in the Silurian\r\nperiod; it is this group in which Madrepores of great size are found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72. Fungia echinata (Milne Edwards).]\r\n\r\nThe family, as we have already said, take their names from their\r\nsupposed resemblance to the Mushroom. \"But,\" says Peyssonnel, \"there is\r\nthis difference between terrestrial and marine mushrooms--that the\r\nformer have leaflets below, and those of the ocean have them above (Fig.\r\n72). These leaflets are only expansions of the Madrepores. Now, although\r\nI have not actually examined these petrified Mushrooms of the sea, I\r\nhave no reason to doubt but that they are true genera or species of\r\nMadrepores, containing, like others, the zoophytes which form them. In\r\nmy travels in Egypt, in 1714 and 1715, I never heard it said that the\r\nNile could produce them.\" In this last remark, Peyssonnel makes allusion\r\nto the opinion entertained by many ancient authors, that the Fungia were\r\nproductions of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe animal is gelatinous or membranous, generally simple, depressed,\r\nand oval, with mouth superior and transverse, in a large disk, which is\r\ncovered by many thick cirrhiform tentacula; the polypidom is rendered\r\nsolid internally by a calcareous solid deposit of a simple figure,\r\nhaving a star of radiating, acutely-pointed lamellæ above, and simple\r\nrays, full of wrinkles, beneath. There are nine species, mostly natives\r\nof the Indian Seas, which De Blainville arranges in three groups,\r\naccording as they are simple and circular, simple and compressed, or\r\ncomplex and oblong. In _Fungia echinata_, represented in Fig. 72, we\r\nhave a species which inhabits the Indian and Chinese Seas. It belongs to\r\nthe last group, being oblong in form, convex above, and concave below.\r\nThe hollow, from which the lamellæ or chamber-walls proceed, are of\r\nconsiderable length; the toothed partitions are very irregular, thin and\r\nprickly, resting upon their lower edge, in order to leave the concave\r\nportion of the field free to a host of excrescences, resembling the roof\r\nof a grotto studded with small stalactites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. Fungia agariciformis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe conformation of the softer parts of this polypus has been described\r\nby many travellers. The upper portion of the body of the animal,\r\ncorresponding to the lamelliform part of the polypus, is furnished with\r\nscattered tentacula, very long in some species, and remarkably short in\r\nothers. These tentacula appear to terminate in a small sucker, and the\r\nanimal seems to recover its position with difficulty, when overturned.\r\nIn order to complete our description of these curious madrepores, we may\r\nrefer to _Fungia agariciformis_, represented in Fig. 73. This remarkable\r\nspecies inhabits the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, and is here\r\nrepresented with its polyps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDe Blainville gave the name of MADREPORÆA to the second group of his\r\nstony _Zoantharia_, placing them after the _Madrephylliæ_. The products\r\nof this section are generally arborescent, with small, partially\r\nlamelliform cells, which are constantly porous in the interstices of the\r\nwalls of the cells, this being its most important characteristic. Thus\r\nthe visceral apparatus constitutes the essential part of the polypus,\r\npresenting no side plates, the visceral chamber being open from the base\r\nto the summit, and neither filled with dissepiments, pulpy matter, nor\r\nwith plates.\r\n\r\nThe history of these inhabitants of the deep is extremely obscure, and\r\nwill probably always remain so; the most beautiful of their productions\r\nare intertropical, and consequently beyond the reach of discriminating\r\nobservers during the life of the animal. Solander proposed to divide the\r\ngenus according to certain characteristics in the growth of the coral,\r\nand De Blainville has rearranged the groups formed by Lamarck,\r\nLamouroux, and Goldfuss, with special reference to the soft parts of the\r\nanimals figured by Lesueur, Quoy, Gaimard, and others, who have observed\r\nthem in their native state.\r\n\r\nThe perforated _Zoantharia_ form three very natural families: the\r\n_Eupsammidæ_, the _Madreporidæ_, and the _Poritidæ_. The first have the\r\nsolid parts of the polyps, simple or complex, with well-developed\r\nlamellar portions, the central column spongious, walls granular,\r\nsemi-ribbed, and perforated. The second are composite, increasing by\r\ngemmation; walls spongy and porous; septa lamellous, and well developed.\r\nIn the third the visceral chambers are divided into two equal parts by\r\nthe principal septa, which are more developed than the others, meeting\r\nby their inner edge. The _Dendrophylliæ_ (Fig. 74) are conspicuous among\r\nthe _Eupsammidæ_.\r\n\r\nWe shall describe three genera, the two first of which belong to the\r\nMADREPORÆA, and the last of the family of the _Porides_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74. Dendrophyllia ramea, half natural size (De\r\nBlainville).]\r\n\r\n_Dendrophyllia ramea_, represented in Figs. 75 and 76, is an elegant\r\nmadrepore of the Mediterranean. Its polyp presents a very large trunk\r\ncharged with short ascending branches; it usually attains to about a\r\nyard and a half in height. The polyps are provided with a great number\r\nof tentacula, in the centre of which the mouth is placed. They are\r\ndeeply buried in the cells, which radiate from numerous unequally\r\n_saillant_ plates. Peyssonnel, who had seen the polyps of this colony,\r\nsays: \"I may observe that the extremities or summits of the branching\r\nmadrepore, the species in question, which in the Provencal we call\r\nSea-fennel, is soft and tender, filled with a glutinous and transparent\r\nmucous thread, similar to that which the snail leaves on its path.\r\nThese extremities are of a fine yellow colour, five or six lines in\r\ndiameter; soft, and more than a finger's breadth in length. I have seen\r\nthe animal nestling in them; it seemed to be a species of cuttle-fish or\r\nsea-nettle. The body of this sea-nettle must have filled the centre; the\r\nhead being in the middle, surrounded by many feet or claws, like those\r\nof the cuttle-fish. The flesh of this animal is very delicate, and is\r\neasily reduced to the form of a paste, melting almost under the touch.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75. Dendrophyllia ramea (De Blainville). Natural\r\nsize, with polypi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76. A part magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe madrepores abound in all intertropical seas, taking a considerable\r\npart in the constitution of the reefs which form the coral and\r\nmadreporic islands so conspicuous in the ocean. The tree-like\r\n_Dendrophyllia_ (_D. ramea_, Figs. 75 and 76) have cells of considerable\r\ndepth, radiating into numerous lamellæ, forming a widely-branching\r\narborescent coral, externally striated, internally furrowed, and\r\ntruncate at the extremities. The animals are actiniform, furnished with\r\nnumerous cleft tentacula, in the centre of which is the polygonal mouth.\r\nIn the _Lobophyllia_, the tentacula are cylindrical, the cells conical,\r\nsometimes elongated and sinuous, with a sub-circular opening terminating\r\nthe few branches of the polyp, which is fixed, turbinate, and striated.\r\nThe Plantain Madrepore, _M. plantaginea_ (Lamarck), is an interesting\r\nexample, the polyp presenting itself, as in Fig. 77, in tufts, with\r\nslender and prolific branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77. Madrepora plantaginea (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nIn _Madrepora palmata_, vulgarly named Neptune's Car, we have a large\r\nand beautiful species, whose expanding branches are flat, round at the\r\nbase, and forming in lobes, whose length is often as much as three feet\r\nhigh, with a breadth of twenty inches, and a thickness of two to two and\r\na half: this fine madrepore is found in the Caribbean Sea and among the\r\nAntilles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORITES.\r\n\r\nThe Porites are madrepores produced by a pitcher-shaped fleshy animal,\r\nwith twelve short tentacula; the cells are unequally polygonal,\r\nimperfectly defined, slightly radiating by thread-like pointed rays,\r\nwith prickles placed at intervals. The polypus is polymorphous or\r\nmany-formed, composed of a reticulated and porous tissue, the\r\nindividuals forming it being always completely united together.\r\nExternally it presents the figure of an irregular trellis-work, more or\r\nless loosely connected in its meshes. As a type of this organization, we\r\ngive a figure of the Forked Porites (_P. furcata_, Fig. 78), of the\r\nnatural size. The branches are generally dichotomous, that is, rising in\r\npairs obtusely lobed. In some of the species the rays are more fully\r\nmarked, and resemble a bed of miniature anemones thickly crowded\r\ntogether, as in _Gonispora columna_, in which the polypi have a central\r\nmouth, round which the twelve short tentacula radiate; the coral is\r\nstony, fixed, branched, or lobed, having a free surface covered with a\r\ngreat number of regular stars, which are highly characteristic, and\r\ncannot be confounded with those of an astrea or madrepore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78. Porites furcata (Lamarck), natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79. Millepora alcicornis (Linn.), one-fourth natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nIn the Tabulate Madreporides, the polyp is essentially composed of a\r\nhighly-developed mural system. The visceral chambers are divided into a\r\nseries of stages or stories, by perfect diaphragms or plates placed\r\ntransversely, the plates depending from the walls and forming perfect\r\nhorizontal divisions, extending from one wall of the general cavity to\r\nthe other. In order that the reader may form some idea of the Tabulate\r\nMadrepores, one of the polyps known as _millepores_ is here represented.\r\nThe millepores were first separated from the madrepores by Linnæus,\r\nalong with a great number of species distinguished by the minuteness of\r\ntheir pores or polypiferous cells (Fig. 79), represented above, as\r\nnearly allied, and perhaps identical with Dr. Johnston's _Cellepora\r\ncervicornis_, a species found in deep water on the Devonshire and\r\nCornwall coasts, and, indeed, all round our west coast. \"A single\r\nspecimen of this millepore is about three inches in height,\" says Dr.\r\nJohnston, \"and somewhat more in breadth. It rises from a broad flattened\r\nbase, and begins immediately to expand and divide into kneed branches or\r\nbroad segments, many of which anastomose, so as to form arches and\r\nimperfect circles. The extreme segments are dilated and variously cut,\r\nsometimes truncate, both sides being perforated with numerous pores just\r\nvisible to the naked eye, and arranged in rows; the pores circular, and\r\nlevel with the surface on the smooth and newly-formed parts; but in the\r\nolder parts they form apertures of urceolate cells, which appear to be\r\nformed over the primary layer of cells, giving to the surface a roughish\r\nor angular appearance. The orifice is simple, contracted, with a very\r\nsmall denticle on one side; the thickness of the branches varies from\r\none half to two lines; the interior is cellular; the new parts are\r\nformed of two layers of horizontal cells, but the older parts are\r\nthickened by cells superimposed on the primary layers.\"\r\n\r\n_Millepora moniliformis_ is a species which attaches itself to the\r\nbranches of the gorgons, and forms there a series of little rounded or\r\nlateral lobes. The animal is unknown, the cells very small, unequal,\r\ncompletely immersed, obsoletely radiate and scattered; the polypier\r\nfixed, cellular within, finely porous and reticulated externally,\r\nextending into a palmated form.\r\n\r\nOf tuberous or wrinkled madrepores, which consist almost entirely of\r\nfossil species chiefly belonging to the Silurian formation, we shall\r\nonly note _Cyathophyllum_ as one of the best known species.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is no spectacle in Nature more extraordinary, or more worthy of\r\nour admiration, than that now under consideration. These zoophytes,\r\nwhose history we are about to investigate--wretched beings gifted with a\r\nhalf-latent life only--these animalcules so small and so fragile--labour\r\nsilently and incessantly in the bosom of the ocean, and, as they exist\r\nin innumerable aggregated masses, their cells and solid axes finish by\r\nproducing in the end enormous stony masses. These calcareous deposits\r\nincrease and multiply with such incalculable rapidity, that they not\r\nonly cover the submarine rocks as with a carpet, but they finish by\r\nforming reefs, and even entire islands, which rise above the surface of\r\nthe ocean in a manner remarkable at once for their form and the\r\nregularity with which they repeat themselves.\r\n\r\nIn noting the Indian and Pacific Oceans, navigators had long been struck\r\nwith the appearance of certain earthy bases, which presented a\r\nconformation altogether singular. In 1601, Pyrard de Laval, speaking of\r\nthe Malouine (now the Falkland) Islands, said: \"They are divided into\r\nthirteen provinces, named _atollons_, which is so far a natural division\r\nin that place, that each atollon is separated from the other, and\r\ncontains a great number of smaller islands. It is a marvel to see each\r\nof these atollons surrounded on all sides by a great bank of\r\nstone--walls such as no human hands could build on the space of earth\r\nallotted to them. These atollons are almost round, or rather oval, being\r\neach about thirty leagues in circumference, some a little less, others a\r\nlittle more, and all ranging from north to south, without any one\r\ntouching the other. There is between them sea channels, one broad, the\r\nother narrow. Being in the middle of an atollon, you see all around you\r\nthis great stone bank, which surrounds and protects the island from the\r\nwaves; but it is a formidable attempt, even for the boldest, to approach\r\nthe bank and watch the waves as they roll in and break with fury upon\r\nthe shore.\"\r\n\r\nSince the publication of Laval's description, many circular isles, or\r\ngroups of islands, analogous to these atollons, since called _atolls_,\r\nhave been discovered in the Pacific Ocean and other seas. The naturalist\r\nForster, who accompanied Cook in his voyage round the world, first made\r\nknown the more remarkable characteristics of these gigantic formations.\r\nHe perfectly comprehended their origin, which he was the first to\r\nattribute to the development of the calcareous zoophytic polypier.\r\n\r\nAfter Forster, many other naturalists--Lamouroux, Chamisso, Quoy,\r\nGaimard, Ehrenberg, Ellis, Darwin, Couthony, and Dana--have furnished\r\nScience with many precious lessons on the natural history of coral\r\nislands and madreporic reefs. We can only glance at a few of the more\r\nremarkable genera of these interesting creatures.\r\n\r\n\"Those occupying the same Coral,\" says Frédol, \"live in perfect harmony;\r\nthey constitute a family of brothers, physically united in the closest\r\nbonds of union. They occupy the same dwelling, each having its separate\r\nchamber; but the power of abandoning it is denied them. Attached each to\r\nits cell, they are driven to trust in Providence for the food which\r\nnever fails them; moreover, what is eaten by each mouth profits the\r\nwhole community. Urged on by a wonderful instinct, the polypes labour\r\ntogether at the same work; isolated, they would be weak and helpless; in\r\ncombination, they are strong.\" M. Lacaze-Duthiers has even demonstrated\r\nthat _Antipathes glaberrima_, _Gorgonia tuberculata_ (Lamarck),\r\n_Leiopathes glaberrima_ (Gray), and _Leiopathes Lamarckii_ (Haime),\r\nwere present on the same coral, the _Gerardia_ of Lamarck. It is thus\r\nrecognized that, under the general denomination of polyps, very distinct\r\ngenera are found, some being of the _Hydra_ type, others belonging to\r\nthe _Plumularia_. The first are very common on our coast: they include\r\nthe _Tubularia_, the _Campanularia_, and the _Sertularia_.\r\n\r\nThe Reed Tubularia (_T. indivisa_) is remarkably curious: its numerous\r\nstems are horny, yellow, and marked at intervals with irregular knots,\r\nresembling the joints of a straw. Their lower extremity is tortuous, and\r\napt to adhere to foreign bodies; the upper part is nearly upright, and\r\nslightly flexuous, the whole resembling some flowering plant, without\r\nleaves or lateral branches. The _Campanularias_ are altogether\r\ndifferent; the end of the branches whence the polyps issue are broad and\r\nbell-shaped, _C. dichotoma_ presenting a stem of brownish colour, thin\r\nas a silken thread, but strong and elastic. The polyps are numerous, a\r\nbranch eight inches in height being inhabited by as many as twelve\r\nhundred individuals.\r\n\r\nThe _Sertularias_ have a horny stem, sometimes simple, sometimes\r\nbranching, and may easily be mistaken for small plants. Their name is\r\nderived from the Latin _sertum_, a bouquet; and, indeed, they can only\r\nbe described as trees in miniature, with branches yellow and\r\nsemi-transparent, each tree having seven, eight, twelve, or twenty small\r\npanicles, each of which will contain about five hundred animals, the\r\ntree itself containing probably an association of ten thousand.\r\nOccasionally _Sertularia argentea_ is said to afford shelter and\r\nemployment for a hundred thousand of these creatures. _S. falcata_,\r\nhaving all the grace and elegance of the delicate and slender Mimosa, is\r\nnow placed among the Bryozoares.\r\n\r\nThe minute cells in which the polyps are lodged are not always arranged\r\nin the same manner. Sometimes the cells occupy one side only; in other\r\ninstances they occupy both; sometimes they are grouped like the pipes of\r\nan organ, at others they are ranged spirally round the stem, or arranged\r\nat intervals, forming horizontal rings round it.\r\n\r\nThe _Alcyonaria_ are very common on some parts of our coast, where\r\nscarcely a stone or shell is dredged up that does not support one or\r\nmore specimens known to the fishermen as \"cow's paps,\" \"dead men's\r\nfingers,\" and other popular names. This round and lobed fleshy mass is\r\nquite a colony in itself; placed in pure sea water, it very soon\r\npresents certain yellow or grass-like points, which gradually expand and\r\ndisplay themselves in their native transparent and animated coralline.\r\nEach of these polyps have eight dentate petals, in the centre of which\r\nis the mouth; the body of the polyp is tubular, varying externally in\r\nlength, traversed internally throughout its entire mass by a tissue\r\nstudded with reddish spiculæ, and furrowed with small reed-like ribbons,\r\ncommon to all the individuals of the association.\r\n\r\nAmong the _Tubiporidæ_ may be noted _Tubipora musica_ (Linnæus), from\r\nthe Indian Ocean, characterised by its stony tubes, simple, numerous,\r\nstraight or flexible, parallel, and slightly radiating, of a fine\r\npurple, and united together at intervals by transverse bands, so as to\r\nresemble the pipes of an organ. The polyp is a brilliant grass green,\r\naccording to Péron; the tentacula furnished on each side with two or\r\nthree rows of granulous fleshy papillæ, to the number of sixty to eighty\r\n(Lesson).\r\n\r\nThe _Gorgonia_ is studded with calcareous or siliceous spiculæ which\r\nform a crust in drying. This crust is friable, and frequently preserves\r\nthe colours more or less brilliant which characterise it. Their cells\r\nare sometimes hollowed out of the plain surface; sometimes they occur in\r\nthe projecting mammals; these are smooth, rough, or scaly--sometimes\r\npendent the one from the other.\r\n\r\nThese animals attach themselves to solid bodies, sometimes even to each\r\nother, grafting themselves or interlacing each other in all directions.\r\nIn colour they are whitish, pure white, yellow, and apple-green; their\r\nshades, passing from olive-brown to deep blue, from vermilion to violet,\r\nand from pale yellow to pearly-grey. Each tube or cell contains an\r\nindividual. The cells are more or less deep, according to the species.\r\nThe polyps are composed generally of a hidden portion more or less\r\ntubular, and of a star-like portion more or less displayed. This latter\r\nportion presents from eight to twelve soft and granulous wattles,\r\nsusceptible of expansion, like the petals of a flower. When these\r\nappendages are displayed, they often attain twice the height of the\r\nbody; in this state they are nearly transparent, except towards the\r\nextremity. They extend or compress these wattles, dilate or contract the\r\nmouth according to their wants; but their digestive tube is firmly\r\nsoldered to the cell, while the axis which supports the cells is\r\nmotionless. What a singular combination is here presented! Trees,\r\none-half of which are animated, growing at the bottom of the sea;\r\npolyps, one-half of which is imprisoned, and riveted to their person;\r\ntheir stomachs in the bark, their arms on a branch, their movements\r\nperfect repose!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IV.--Coral Island of Clermont-Tonnerre, in the\r\nPomotouan Archipelago.]\r\n\r\nThese minute silent workers are active and indefatigable; their task is\r\nto separate the salt and other chemical particles from the waters of the\r\nocean, and, while feeding themselves, secrete and organise the axis\r\nwhich bears their lodging. They love the warmer regions of the ocean; in\r\ncolder regions, the results of their labours are extremely limited: the\r\none forms a sward of submarine life, which carpets the rocks; the other\r\nproduces animated stalactites, great shrubs, whole forests of small\r\ntrees. The electric cable which unites Sardinia to the Genoese fort was\r\nso encrusted with corals and bryozoares, that certain portions taken\r\nfrom the water for repairs had attained the size of a small barrel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe atolls present three unfailing and constant peculiarities. Sometimes\r\nthey constitute a great circular chain, the centre of which is occupied\r\nby a deep basin, in direct communication with the exterior sea, through\r\none or many breaches of great depth. These are the _atolls_, described\r\nmore than two centuries ago by Pyrard de Laval; sometimes they surround,\r\nbut at some distance, a small island, in such a manner as to constitute\r\na sort of skeleton or girdle of reefs; finally they may form the\r\nimmediate edging or border of an island or continent. In this last case\r\nthey are called fringing littorals, or edging reefs. At the distance of\r\na few hundred yards only from the edge of some of these reefs, the sea\r\nis of such a depth that the sounding-lead has failed to reach the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nIn order to give an idea of the general form of these atolls, although\r\nthey are rarely so regular, the reader is referred to PL. III., which\r\nrepresents one of these islands of the Pomotouan Archipelago, in the\r\nIndian Ocean. It represents the island of Clermont-Tonnerre, figured by\r\nCaptain Wilkes in the American Exploring Expedition. The exterior girdle\r\nof rocks here surrounds a basin nearly circular. Such is the general\r\nform--the typical form, so to speak--of the coral isles, of which this\r\nis a fair representation.\r\n\r\nThe zoophytes which form these mineral accumulations belong to diverse\r\ngroups, and nowhere have the results of observations made upon these\r\natolls been more minutely described than in Mr. Darwin's remarks on the\r\ngrand Cocos Island situated to the south of Sumatra, in the Indian\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nNo writer, it seems to us, has reasoned on these atolls more\r\ncomprehensively than the author of the \"Origin of Species.\" \"The earlier\r\nvoyagers,\" he says, \"fancied that the coral-building animals\r\ninstinctively built up their great corals to afford themselves\r\nprotection in the inner parts; but so far is this from the truth, that\r\nthose massive kinds, to whose growth on the exposed outer shores the\r\nvery existence of the reef depends, cannot live within the lagoon, where\r\nother delicately-branching kinds flourish. Moreover, in this view, many\r\nspecies of distinct genera and families are supposed to combine for one\r\nend; and of such a combination not a single instance can be found in the\r\nwhole of nature. The theory that has been most generally received is,\r\nthat atolls are based on submarine craters, but when the form and size\r\nof some of them are considered, this idea loses its plausible character.\r\nThus, the Suadiva atoll is forty-four geographical miles in diameter in\r\none line by thirty-four in another; Rimsky is fifty-four by twenty miles\r\nacross; Bow atoll is thirty miles long, and, on an average, six miles\r\nbroad. This theory, moreover, is totally inapplicable to the Northern\r\nMaldivian atolls in the Indian Ocean, one of which is eighty-eight miles\r\nin length, and between ten and twenty in breadth.\"\r\n\r\nThe various theories which had been propounded failing to explain the\r\nexistence of the coral islands, Mr. Darwin was led to reconsider the\r\nwhole subject. Numerous soundings taken all round the Cocos atoll showed\r\nthat at ten fathoms the prepared tallow in the hollow of the sounding\r\nrod came up perfectly clean, and marked with the impression of living\r\npolyps. As the depth increased, these impressions became less numerous,\r\nbut adhering particles of sand succeed, until it was evident that the\r\nbottom consisted of smooth sand. From these observations, it was obvious\r\nto him that the utmost depth at which the coral polyps can construct\r\nreefs is between twenty and thirty fathoms. Now, there are enormous\r\nareas in the Indian Ocean in which every island is a coral formation\r\nraised to the height to which the waves can throw up fragments and the\r\nwinds pile up sand; and the only theory which seems to account for all\r\nthe circumstances embraced, is that of the subsidence of vast regions in\r\nthis ocean. \"As mountain after mountain and island after island slowly\r\nsunk beneath the water,\" he says, \"fresh bases would be successively\r\nafforded for the growth of the corals. I venture to defy any one to\r\nexplain in any other manner how it is possible that numerous islands\r\nshould be distributed throughout vast areas, all the islands being low,\r\nall built of coral absolutely requiring a foundation within a limited\r\ndepth below the surface.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Porites_, according to Mr. Darwin, form the most elevated deposits\r\nof those which are situated nearer the level of the water: _Millepora\r\ncomplanata_ also enters into the formation of the upper banks. Various\r\nother branched corals present themselves in great numbers in the\r\ncavities left by the _Porites_ and _Millepora_ crossing each other. It\r\nis difficult to identify species occupying themselves in the deeper\r\nparts, but, according to Darwin, the lower parts of the reefs are\r\noccupied by polyps of the same species as in the upper parts; at the\r\ndepth of eighteen fathoms and upwards, the bottom consists alternately\r\nof sand and corals. The total breadth of the circular reef or ring which\r\nconstitutes the atoll of the Keeling or Cocos Island varies from two\r\nhundred to five hundred yards in breadth. Some little parasitic isles\r\nform themselves upon the reefs, at two or three hundred yards from their\r\nexterior edge, by the accumulation of the fragments thrown up here\r\nduring great storms. They rise from two to three yards above the sea\r\nlevel, and consist of shells, corals, and sea urchins, the whole\r\nconsolidated into hard and solid rock.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin's description of a kind of Sea-pen, _Virgularia Patagonia_,\r\nthrows some curious light on the habits of these creatures. \"This\r\nzoophyte consists of a thin, straight, fleshy stem, with alternate rows\r\nof polypi on each side, and surrounding an elastic stony axis, varying\r\nin length from eight inches to two feet. The stem at one extremity is\r\ntruncate, but at the other is terminated by a vermiform fleshy\r\nappendage. The stony axis, which gives strength to the stem, may be\r\ntraced at the extremity into a mere vessel filled with granular matter.\r\nAt low water, hundreds of these zoophytes might be seen projecting like\r\nstubble, with the truncate end upwards, a few inches above the surface\r\nof the muddy sand. When touched or pulled, they suddenly drew themselves\r\nin with force, so as nearly, or quite, to disappear. By this action, the\r\nhighly elastic axis must be bent at the lower extremity, where it is\r\nnaturally slightly curved; and I imagine it is by this elasticity alone\r\nthat the zoophyte is enabled to rise again through the mud. Each polyp,\r\nthough closely united to its brethren, has a distinct mouth, body, and\r\ntentacula. Of these polyps, in a large specimen there must be many\r\nthousands, yet we see that they act by one movement. They have also one\r\ncentral axis connected with a system of obscure circulation, and the ova\r\nare produced in an organ distinct from the separate individuals. For,\"\r\nadds Mr. Darwin, in a note, \"the cavities leading from the fleshy\r\ncompartments of the extremity were filled with a yellow pulpy matter\r\nwhich, under a microscope, consisted of rounded semi-transparent grains\r\naggregated together into particles of various sizes. All such particles,\r\nas well as separate grains, possessed the power of rapid motion,\r\ngenerally revolving round different axes, but sometimes progressive.\"\r\n\r\nThe description of the Island of Cocos or Keeling is as follows:--\"The\r\nring-formed reef of the lagoon island is surmounted, in the greater part\r\nof its length, by linear islets. On the northern, or leeward side, there\r\nis an opening through which vessels can pass to the anchorage within. On\r\nentering, the scene was very curious, and rather pretty; its beauty,\r\nhowever, entirely depended on the brilliancy of the surrounding colours.\r\nThe shallow, clear, and still water of the lagoon, resting in its\r\ngreater part on white sand, is, when illumined by a vertical sun, of the\r\nmost vivid green. This brilliant expanse, several miles in width, is on\r\nall sides divided, either by a line of snow-white breakers from the dark\r\nheaving waters of the ocean, or from the blue vault of heaven by the\r\nstrips of land crowned by the level tops of the cocoa-nut tree. As a\r\nwhite cloud here and there affords a pleasing contrast to the azure sky,\r\nso in the lagoon bands of living coral darken the emerald-green water.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning I went ashore on Direction Island. The strip of dry\r\nland is only a few hundred yards in width; on the lagoon side there was\r\na white calcareous beach, the radiation from which, under this sultry\r\nclimate, was very oppressive. On the outer coast, a solid broad flat of\r\ncoral rock served to break the violence of the open sea. Excepting near\r\nthe lagoon, where there is some sand, the land is entirely composed of\r\nrounded fragments of coral. In such a loose, dry, stony soil, the\r\nclimate of the intertropical regions alone could produce so vigorous a\r\nvegetation. On some of the smaller islets, nothing could be more elegant\r\nthan the manner in which the young and full-grown cocoa-nut trees,\r\nwithout destroying each other's symmetry, were mingled into one wood. A\r\nbeach of glittering white sand formed a border to those fairy spots.\r\n\r\n\"The natural history of these islands, from its very paucity, possesses\r\npeculiar interest. The cocoa-nut tree, at the first glance, seems to\r\ncompose the whole wood; there are, however, five or six other trees. One\r\nof these grows to a very large size, but, from the extreme softness of\r\nits wood, it is useless; another sort affords excellent timber for\r\nshipbuilding. Besides the trees, the number of plants is exceedingly\r\nlimited, and consist of insignificant weeds. In my collection, which\r\nincludes, I believe, nearly the perfect Flora, there are twenty species,\r\nwithout reckoning a moss, lichen, and fungus. To this number two trees\r\nmust be added, one of which was not in flower, and the other I only\r\nheard of. The latter is a solitary tree of its kind, and grows near the\r\nbeach, where, without doubt, the one seed was thrown up by the waves.\r\n\r\n\"The next day I employed myself in examining the very interesting yet\r\nsimple structure and origin of these islands. The water being unusually\r\nsmooth, I waded over the flat of dead rock as far as the living mounds\r\nof coral, on which the swell of the open sea breaks. In some of the\r\ngulleys and hollows there were beautiful green and other coloured\r\nfishes, and the forms and tints of many of the zoophytes were admirable.\r\nIt is excusable to grow enthusiastic over the infinite number of organic\r\nbeings with which the sea of the Tropics, so prodigal of life, teems;\r\nyet I must confess, I think those naturalists who have described in\r\nwell-known words the submarine grottoes, decked with a thousand\r\nbeauties, have indulged in rather exuberant language.\r\n\r\n\"I accompanied Captain Fitzroy to an island at the head of the lagoon;\r\nthe channel was exceedingly intricate, winding through fields of\r\ndelicately-branched corals. At the head of the lagoon we crossed a\r\nnarrow islet, and found a great surf breaking on the windward coast. I\r\ncan hardly explain the reason, but there is, to my mind, much grandeur\r\nin the view of the outer shores of these lagoon islands. There is a\r\nsimplicity in the barrier-like beach, the margin of green bushes and\r\ntall cocoa-nuts, the solid flat of dead coral-rock, strewed here and\r\nthere with great loose fragments, and the line of furious breakers, all\r\nrounding away towards either hand. The ocean, throwing its waters over\r\nthe broad reef, appears an invincible, all-powerful enemy; yet we see it\r\nresisted and even conquered by means which at first seem most weak and\r\ninefficient. It is not that the ocean spares the rock of coral; the\r\ngreat fragments scattered over the reef, and heaped on the beach whence\r\nthe tall cocoa-nut springs, plainly bespeak the unrelenting power of the\r\nwaves. Nor are any periods of repose granted; the long swell caused by\r\nthe gentle but steady action of the trade-winds, always blowing in one\r\ndirection over a wide area, causes breakers almost equalling in force\r\nthose during a gale of wind in the temperate regions, and which never\r\ncease to rage. It is impossible to behold these waves without feeling a\r\nconviction that an island, though built of the hardest rocks--let it be\r\nporphyry, granite, or quartz--would ultimately yield and be demolished\r\nby such an irresistible power. Yet these low, insignificant coral islets\r\nstand, and are victorious; for here another power, as an antagonist,\r\ntakes part in the contest. The organic forces separate the atoms of\r\ncarbonate of lime, one by one, from the foaming breakers, and unite them\r\ninto a symmetrical structure. Let the hurricane tear up its thousand\r\nhuge fragments, yet what will that tell against the accumulated labour\r\nof myriads of architects at work night and day, month after month? Thus\r\ndo we see the soft and gelatinous body of a polyp, through the agency of\r\nthe vital laws, conquering the great mechanical power of the waves of an\r\nocean which neither the art of man nor the inanimate works of Nature\r\ncould successfully resist.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have said that madreporic or coralline formations affect three forms,\r\nto which the names of _atolls_, _barrier reefs_, and _fringing reefs_\r\nhave been applied. We have spoken of atolls; we shall now say a few\r\nwords on barrier and fringing reefs.\r\n\r\nBarrier reefs are formations which surround the ordinary islands, or\r\nstretch along their banks. They have the form and general structure of\r\natolls. Like atolls, the barrier reefs appear placed on the edge of a\r\nmarine precipice. They rise on the edge of a plateau which looks down on\r\na bottomless sea. On the coast of New Caledonia, only two lengths of his\r\nship from the reef, Captain Kent found no bottom in a hundred and fifty\r\nfathoms. This was verified at Gambier Island in the Pacific Ocean, in\r\nQualem Island, and at many others.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Darwin, the barrier reef situated on the western coast\r\nof New Caledonia is four hundred miles long; that along the eastern\r\ncoast of Australia extends almost without interruption for a thousand\r\nmiles, ranging from twenty or thirty to fifty or sixty miles from the\r\ncoast. As to the elevation of the islands thus surrounded with reefs,\r\nit varies considerably. The Isle of Tahiti rises six thousand eight\r\nhundred feet above the level of the sea; the Isle of Maurua to six\r\nhundred; Aituaki to three hundred; and Manonai to about fifty feet only.\r\n\r\nAround the Isle of Gambier the reef has a thickness of a thousand and\r\nsixty feet, at Tahiti of two hundred and thirty. Round the Fiji Islands\r\nit is from two to three thousand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _fringing reefs_ immediately surrounding the island, or a portion of\r\nit, might be confounded with the barrier reefs we have been describing,\r\nif they only differed in their smaller breadth; but the circumstance\r\nthat they abut immediately on the coast in place of being separated by a\r\nchannel or lagoon more or less deep and continuous, proves that they are\r\nin direct communication with the slope of the submarine soil, and\r\npermits of their being distinguished from the barrier reefs. The\r\ndangerous breakers which surround the Mauritius are a striking example\r\nof the fringing reef. This island is almost entirely surrounded by a\r\nbarrier of these rocks, the breadth of which varies from a hundred and\r\nfifty to three hundred and thirty feet; their rugged and abrupt surface\r\nis worn almost smooth, and is rarely uncovered at low water. Analogous\r\nreefs surround the Isle of Bourbon; all round this island the polyps\r\nconstruct on the volcanic bottom of the sea detached mammalons, which\r\nrise from a fathom to a fathom and a half above the water.\r\n\r\nMadreporic coasting reefs present themselves also on the eastern coast\r\nof Africa and of Brazil. In the Red Sea, reefs of corals exist which may\r\nbe ranked among the madreporic coasting reefs, in consequence of the\r\nlimited breadth of the gulf. Ehrenberg and Hemprich examined a hundred\r\nand fifty stations in the Red Sea, all of which had outlying fringing\r\nreefs of this description.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, With what rapidity are these coral and madreporic banks\r\nformed, so as to become _atolls_ and _fringing reefs_? To answer this\r\nquestion even approximately is very difficult. On the coast of the\r\nMauritius, according to M. d'Archaic,[6] the learned professor of the\r\nJardin des Plantes, the edge of the reef is produced by _Madrepora\r\ncorymbosa_, _M. pocillifera_, and two species of _Astrea_, which pursue\r\ntheir operations at the depth of from eight to fifteen fathoms. At the\r\nbase is a bank of _Seriatopora_, from fifteen to twenty fathoms in\r\nheight. At the bottom, the sand is covered with _Seriatopora_. At twenty\r\nfathoms we also meet with fragments of _Madrepora_. Between twenty and\r\nforty fathoms the bottom is sandy, and the sounding-rod brings up great\r\nfragments of _Caryophylla_. According to MM. Quoy and Gaimard, the\r\n_Astreas_, which, as these naturalists consider, constitute the greater\r\npart of the reefs, cannot live beyond four or five fathoms deep.\r\n_Millepora alcicornis_ extends from the surface to the depth of twelve\r\nfathoms; the _Madrepores_ and _Seriatopores_ down to twenty fathoms.\r\nConsiderable masses of _Meandrina_ have been observed at sixteen\r\nfathoms; and a _Caryophylla_ has been brought up from eighty fathoms in\r\nthirty-three degrees south latitude. Among the polyps which do not form\r\nsolid reefs, Mr. Darwin mentions _Cellaria_, found at a hundred and\r\nninety fathoms deep, _Gorgonia_ at a hundred and sixty, _Corallines_ at\r\na hundred, _Millepora_ at from thirty to forty-five, _Sertularias_ at\r\nforty, and _Tubulipora_ at ninety-five fathoms.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dana, none of the species which form reefs--namely,\r\n_Madrepora_, _Millepora_, _Porites_, _Astreas_, and _Meandrineas_--can\r\nlive at a greater depth than eighteen fathoms. It is only near the\r\nsurface of the water that the zoophytes which produce minerals and form\r\nmadreporic banks put forth their powers; the points most exposed to the\r\nbeating of the waves is that which is most favourable to their growth;\r\nit is there that the _Astreas_, _Porites_, and _Millepores_ most abound.\r\n\r\nThe proportionate increase of the structures, according to Mr. Darwin,\r\ndepends at once upon the species which construct the reefs and upon\r\nvarious accessary circumstances. The ordinary rate of increase of the\r\nmadrepores, according to Dana, is about an inch and a half annually;\r\nand, as their branches are much scattered, this will not exceed half an\r\ninch in thickness of the whole surface covered by the madrepore. Again,\r\nin consequence of their porosity, this quantity will be reduced to\r\nthree-eighths of an inch of compact matter. It is, besides, to be noted\r\nthat great spaces are wanting; the sands filling up the destroyed part\r\nof the polyp are washed out by the currents in the great depths where\r\nthere are no living corals, and the surface occupied by them is reduced\r\nto a sixth of the whole coralline region, which reduces the preceding\r\nthree-eighths to one-sixth. The shells and other organic débris will\r\nprobably represent a fourth of the total produce in relation to corals.\r\nIn this manner, taking everything into account, the mean increase of a\r\nreef cannot exceed the eighth of an inch annually. According to this\r\ncalculation, some reefs which are not less than two thousand feet thick\r\nwould require for their formation a hundred and ninety-two thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to add, however, that in favourable circumstances the\r\nincrease of the masses of coral may be much more rapid. Mr. Darwin\r\nspeaks of a ship which, having been wrecked in the Persian Gulf, was\r\nfound, after being submerged only twenty months, to be covered with a\r\nbed of coral two feet in thickness; he also mentions experiments made by\r\nMr. Allen on the coast of Madagascar, which tend to prove that in the\r\nspace of six months certain corals increased nearly three feet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe proceed to the theoretic explanation of these curious mineral\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nNaturalists and navigators have been much divided in opinion as to the\r\ntrue origin of these madreporic islands. Most of them have admitted that\r\nthese enormous banks are composed of the mineral spoils and earthy\r\ndetritus of the madrepores and corals, which, developing themselves in\r\ntheir midst, or upon the bed of the ocean, multiplying and superposing\r\nthemselves, age after age, and generation after generation, have finally\r\nconcluded by forming deposits of this immense extent. The growth of the\r\nvast madreporic column would be finally arrested by the want of water\r\nwhen its summit approached the level of the sea. It is thus that\r\nForster, Péron, Flinders, and Chamisso have explained the formation of\r\nthe _atolls_ and _madreporic_ reefs. This opinion has also found a\r\nsupporter, in our times, in the French admiral, Du Petit Thouars. But he\r\nobjects, with reason, that the corals cannot live at the prodigious\r\ndepth of sea at which the base of these islets lie. It has therefore\r\nbeen found necessary to seek for another cause to satisfy the diverse\r\nconditions of the phenomena, and explain, at the same time, the strange\r\ncircular arrangement of these islands, which is almost constant, and\r\nwhich it is essential to keep in view.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell was of opinion that the base of an atoll was always\r\nthe crater of an ancient submarine volcano, which, when crowned with\r\ncorals and madrepores, would naturally reproduce this circular wall\r\nformed of heaped-up corals.\r\n\r\nThis theory supposes the existence of volcanic craters in the\r\nneighbourhood of all the coral islands. It is quite certain that these\r\nislands are often found not far from extinct volcanoes, and Sir Charles\r\nLyell has published a very curious map in connection with the subject;\r\nnevertheless, the coincidence does not always exist. We have already\r\nremarked on the theory by which Mr. Darwin seeks to explain the\r\ncomplicated conditions of the phenomena. The explanation proposed\r\naccounts for the known facts, as well as the present appearance of the\r\nmadreporic islands. The circular atolls and madreporic banks which are\r\ndisposed as a sort of girdle, are principally formed of _porites_,\r\n_millepora_, and _astrea_, zoophytes which cannot exist at any great\r\ndepth in the ocean, but which swarm on the rocks at some few fathoms\r\nonly below the limits of the tide. These animals, by means of their\r\naccumulated débris, soon form a sort of coating round the island, which\r\nconstitutes the littoral reefs: this marginal tongue or shoulder,\r\naccording to Mr. Darwin, is the first stage in the existence of a\r\nmadreporic island. At this point the author introduces a geological\r\ncause, namely, a great subsiding movement of the soil, in which the\r\nmadreporic colony is sunk under the water. It is evident that after\r\nsubmersion the zoophyte will only continue to develop itself on the\r\nupper surface, and within the limits which its nature prescribes. The\r\nmadrepores exhibiting their greatest vitality at the points most exposed\r\nto the fury of the waves, it will be near the outer edge of the reef\r\nthat the development will be most rapid. If the subsidence of the island\r\nthus surrounded should still continue, as mountain after mountain and\r\nisland after island slowly sink beneath the water, fresh bases would be\r\nsuccessively afforded for the growth of the corals, and the outer edge\r\nelevated by their continual labour, thus transforming the space into a\r\nsort of circular lagune. The madreporic deposits would thus form an\r\nisolated girdle, and the lagune, which occupies the centre, would become\r\ndeeper and deeper in proportion to the lowering of the soil. This is the\r\nsecond stage of the madreporic isle.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the atolls are thus subordinated to two principal\r\nconditions: the progressive subsidence of the shore washed by the sea,\r\nand the existence of coral formed of stony cells, the growth and\r\nmultiplication of which are extremely rapid.\r\n\r\nIt follows from this that madreporic isles cannot exist in all seas;\r\nthat they only have their birth in the Torrid zone, or at least near the\r\nTropics, for it is only in these regions where the warmth exists, so\r\nnecessary to their development, that the madrepores show themselves in\r\ngreatest abundance.\r\n\r\nThe great field of madreporic formations, in short, is found in the warm\r\nparts of the Pacific Ocean. It is from this point, as from a common\r\ncentre, round which are ranged the series of madreporic isles and\r\nislets, that it will be useful, in concluding this chapter, to trace\r\ntheir geographical distribution. We borrow the materials for this from\r\nMilne Edwards's _tableaux_ of their distribution in the principal seas\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nIt is, as we have said, only in the warm parts of the Pacific Ocean that\r\nthe great mass of these islands are found. They give birth towards the\r\nsouth to the group of atolls known as the archipelago of the Bashee\r\nIslands, the extreme limit of the region being the Isle of Ducie. A\r\nmultitude of other islands of the same nature are sparsely scattered\r\nover the sea, up to the east coast of Australia. There are enormous\r\nareas here, in which every single island is of coral formation, and is\r\nraised to the height at which the waves can throw up fragments. The\r\nRadack group is an angular square, four hundred miles long by two\r\nhundred and forty broad. Between this group and the Low Archipelago\r\nitself, eight hundred and forty miles by four hundred and twenty, there\r\nare groups and single islands covering a linear space of more than four\r\nthousand miles. To the north of the Equator, the archipelago of the\r\nCaroline Islands constitutes a very considerable group of madreporic\r\nformation, comprehending upwards of a thousand, extending in a broad\r\nbelt over nearly forty degrees of longitude. On the other hand, all\r\nalong the coast of the American continent, round the Galapagos and the\r\nIsle of Paques, we find no trace of them. The reason assigned is, that\r\nin these regions a great current of cold water, flowing from the\r\nAntarctic Pole, so much lowers the temperature of the sea, that the\r\nzoophytes no longer possess the requisite vigour.\r\n\r\nWe still meet with atolls in the Chinese Seas, and madreporic barrier\r\nreefs are abundant round the Marianne and Philippine Islands. These\r\nmarginal reefs form also an immense tract, from the Isle of Timor, along\r\nthe south coast of Sumatra, up to the island of Nicobar, in the Bay of\r\nBengal.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Indian Peninsula, the Maldive and Laccadive Islands\r\nform the extremity of another group of atolls, and important madreporic\r\nreefs, which extend towards the south, by the Maldives and the Chagos\r\nIslands; they consist of low coral formations, densely clothed with\r\ncocoa-nut trees. The Maldives, the most southerly cluster, include\r\nupwards of a thousand islands and reefs; the Laccadives, seventeen in\r\nnumber, are of similar origin. The Saya de Malha bank, towards the\r\nsouth-east, constitutes a further group of madreporic islets. Finally,\r\nthe coast of the Mauritius, of Madagascar, of the Seychelles, and even\r\nthe African continent, from the northern extremity of the Mozambique\r\nChannel to the bottom of the Red Sea, are studded with numerous reefs of\r\nthe same nature. They fail, however, almost completely, along the coast\r\nof the Asiatic continent, where, among others, the waters of the\r\nEuphrates, the Indus, and the Ganges, enter the sea, and diversify its\r\ninhabitants. The western coast of Africa, and the east coast of the\r\nAmerican continent, are almost entirely destitute of great madreporic\r\nreefs, but they abound in the Caribbean Seas. In the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nwhere the vast fresh-water current of the Mississippi debouches into the\r\nsea, they are unknown. It is principally on the north coast and upon the\r\neastern flanks of the chain of West Indian Islands that the madreporic\r\nreefs show themselves in these regions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe polyps which have produced these vast ranges of islands would be set\r\ndown, at first sight, as the most incapable objects in creation for\r\naccomplishing it. In the case of the _Pennatulidæ_, the case is\r\ncoriaceous, strengthened with calcareous particles; the interior is a\r\nfibrous network containing a transparent jelly in the squares, and\r\npermeated by a certain number of longitudinal cartilaginous tubes; the\r\nsoft part is uniformly gelatinous, but the skin is also coriaceous, with\r\na great number of calcareous spicula placed parallel to one another,\r\nadding greatly to its strength and consistency.\r\n\r\nThe polyps are placed in this external fleshy crust; their position\r\nbeing marked by an orifice on the surface, distinguished by eight\r\nstar-like rays, which open when the upper portion of the body is forced\r\noutwards, in which state it resembles a cylindrical bladder or nipple\r\ncrowned with a fringe of tentacula, which surround the mouth. Under this\r\norifice is the stomach, occupying the centre of the cylinder. The space\r\nbetween this stomach and the outer envelope is divided into eight equal\r\ncompartments or cells by as many thin septa, originating in a labial rim\r\nor lip between the basis of the tentacula, which descend through the\r\ncylinder attached on the one side to the inner tunic of the body, and on\r\nthe other to the stomach, which is thus retained in its position.\r\n\r\nThe protruding portion of the polyp is very delicate, the internal\r\nviscera being, as it were, enclosed in a bladder formed of two very thin\r\nmembranes in intimate union, so transparent as to permit a view of their\r\narrangement. At the base of the body, where thickest, it coalesces with\r\nthe base of the adjacent polyp; thus constituting the common cortical\r\nportion into which each animal retreats at will, by a process in many\r\nrespects resembling that by which a snail draws in its horns. In the\r\ngreater number of _Asteroidæ_ this common portion secretes carbonate of\r\nlime, which is deposited in the meshes of its tissues either in granules\r\nor in crystalline spiculæ, which imparts a solid consistency to the\r\nwhole. The inner tissue meanwhile continues unaltered, being prolonged\r\nthroughout the polypiferous lining of the cell, the abdominal cavity,\r\nand the longitudinal canals which permeate the whole polyp, as well as\r\nthe tubular network with which the space between the canals is occupied.\r\nIt is among these inner tissues that the buds or gemmæ are generated, by\r\nwhose increase and evolution the polyp mass is enlarged, the shape and\r\nsize depending on the manner in which the buds are evolved; for in some,\r\nas in the _Pennatulidæ_, determinate spots only have the appropriated\r\norganization, while in others, as in _Alcyonium_, the generative faculty\r\nappears to be undefined and more diffused.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTINIARIA.\r\n\r\nHere we leave the group of polyps which form united families. The Sea\r\nAnemones, of which the _Actinia_ are the type, consist of _Zoanthaires_,\r\nwhich produce no corals, that is to say, of polyps whose covering\r\nremains always soft, and in whose interior nothing solid is produced.\r\nThis order is usually divided into two families--the _Actiniadæ_, having\r\nthe tentacles in uninterrupted circles, with no corallum, and the\r\n_Minyadinæ_, having globose bodies, and very short tentacula.\r\n\r\nThe modern aquarium exposes the spectator to many wonderful surprises.\r\nCoiled up against the transparent crystal walls of the basin, he\r\nobserves living creatures of the most brilliant shades of colour, and\r\nmore resembling flowers than animals. Supported by a solid base and\r\ncylindrical stem, he sees them terminate like the corolla of a flower,\r\nas in the petals of the anemone: these are the animals we call _Sea\r\nAnemones_--curious zoophytes, which, as all persons familiar with the\r\nsea shore may have observed, are now seen suspended from the rocks, and\r\npresently buried at the bottom of the sea, or floating on its surface.\r\nThese charming and timid creatures are also called _Actinia_, as\r\nindicating their disposition to form rays or stars, from the Greek\r\nἀκτὶν, a ray.\r\n\r\nThe body of these animals is cylindrical in form, terminating beneath in\r\na muscular disk, which is generally large and distinct, enabling them to\r\ncling vigorously to foreign bodies. It terminates above in an upper\r\ndisk, bearing many rows of tentacles, which differ from each other only\r\nin their size. These tentacles are sometimes decorated with brilliant\r\ncolours, forming a species of collarette, consisting of contractile and\r\noften retractile tubes, pierced at their points with an orifice, whence\r\nissue jets of water, which is ejected at the will of the animal.\r\nArranged in multiples of circles, they distribute themselves with\r\nperfect regularity round the mouth. These are the arms of this species\r\nof zoophyte.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Actinia opens among the tentacles. Oval in form, it\r\ncommunicates by means of a tube with a stomach, broad and short, which\r\ndescends vertically, and abuts by a large opening on the visceral\r\ncavity, the interior of which is divided into little cells or chambers.\r\nThese cells and chambers are not all of the same dimensions; in parting\r\nfrom the cylindrical walls of the body, they advance, the one\r\nincreasing, the others getting smaller, in the direction of the centre.\r\nMoreover, they have many kinds of cells, which dispose themselves in\r\ntheir different relations with great regularity--their tentacula, which\r\ncorrespond with them, being arranged in circles radiating more or less\r\nfrom the centre.\r\n\r\nThe stomach of the sea anemones fulfils a multitude of functions. At\r\nfirst, it is the digestive organ; it is also the seat of respiration;\r\nand is unceasingly moistened by the water, which it passes through,\r\nimbibes, and ejects. The visceral cavity absorbs the atmospheric air\r\ncontained in the water; for the stomach is also a lung, and through the\r\nsame organ it ejects its young! In short, the reproductive organs, the\r\neggs, and the larvæ, are all connected with the tentacles or arms. In\r\nthe month of September the eggs are fecundated, and the larvæ or embryos\r\ndeveloped. As Frédol says in \"La Monde de la Mer,\" \"These animals bear\r\ntheir young, not upon their arms, but in their arms. The larvæ generally\r\npass from the tentacula into the stomach, and are afterwards ejected\r\nfrom the mouth along with the rejecta of their food--a most singular\r\nformation, in which the stomach breathes, and the mouth serves the\r\npurposes of accouchement--facts which it would be difficult to believe\r\non other than the most positive evidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Daisy-like Anemones (_Sagartia bellis_--Gosse), in the Zoological\r\nGardens of Paris,\" says Frédol, \"frequently throw up little embryos,\r\nwhich are dispersed, and attach themselves to various parts of the\r\naquarium, and finally become miniature anemones exactly like the parent.\r\nAn actinia which had taken a very copious repast ejected a portion of it\r\nabout twenty-four hours later, and in the middle of the ejected food\r\nwere found thirty-eight young individuals.\" According to Dalyell, an\r\naccouchement is here a fit of indigestion.\r\n\r\nThe lower class of animals have, in fact, as the general basis of their\r\norganization, a sac with a single opening, which is applied, as we have\r\nseen, to a great variety of uses. It receives and rejects; it swallows\r\nand it vomits. The vomiting becomes necessary and habitual--the normal\r\ncondition, in short, of the animal--and is perhaps a source of pleasure\r\nto it, for it is not a malady, but a function, and even a function\r\nmultiplied. In the sea anemone it expels the excrement, and lays its\r\neggs; in others, as we have seen, it even serves the purposes of\r\nrespiration; so that the animal flowers may probably be said to enjoy\r\ntheir regular and periodical vomit.\r\n\r\nThe sea anemones multiply their species in another manner. On the edge\r\nof their base certain bud-like excrescences may often be observed. These\r\nbuds are by-and-by transformed into embryos, which detach themselves\r\nfrom the mother, and soon become individuals in all respects resembling\r\nher. This mode of reproduction greatly resembles some of the vegetative\r\nprocesses. Another and very singular mode of reproduction has been noted\r\nby Mr. Hogg in the case of _Actinia oeillet_. Wishing to detach this\r\nanemone from the aquarium, this gentleman used every effort to effect\r\nhis purpose; but only succeeded, after violent exertions, in tearing\r\nthe lower part of the animal. Six portions remained attached to the\r\nglass walls of the aquarium. At the end of eight days, attempts were\r\nagain made to detach these fragments; but it was observed, with much\r\nsurprise, that they shrank from the touch and contracted themselves.\r\nEach of them soon became crowned with a little row of tentacula, and\r\nfinally each fragment became a new anemone. Every part of these strange\r\ncreatures thus becomes a separate being when detached, while the\r\nmutilated mother continues to live as if nothing had happened. In short,\r\nit has long been known that the sea anemones may be cut limb from limb,\r\nmutilated, divided, and subdivided. One part of the body cut off is\r\nquickly replaced. Cut off the tentacles of an actinia, and they are\r\nreplaced in a short time, and the experiment may be repeated\r\nindefinitely. The experiments made by M. Trembley of Geneva upon the\r\nfresh-water polypi were repeated by the Abbé Dicquemare on the sea\r\nanemones. He mutilated and tormented them in a hundred ways. The parts\r\ncut off continued to live, and the mutilated creature had the power of\r\nreproducing the parts of which it had been deprived. To those who\r\naccused the Abbé of cruelty in thus torturing the poor creatures, he\r\nreplied that, so far from being a cause of suffering to them, \"he had\r\nincreased their term of life, and renewed their youth.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Actiniadæ_ vary in their habitat from pools near low-water mark to\r\neighteen or twenty fathoms water, whence they have been dredged up.\r\n\"They adhere,\" says Dr. Johnston, \"to rocks, shells, and other\r\nextraneous bodies by means of a glutinous secretion from their enlarged\r\nbase, but they can leave their hold and remove to another station\r\nwhensoever it pleases them, either by gliding along with a slow and\r\nalmost imperceptible movement (half an inch in five minutes), as is\r\ntheir usual method, or by reversing the body and using the tentacula for\r\nthe purpose of feet, as Réaumur asserts, and as I have once witnessed;\r\nor, lastly, inflating the body with water, so as to render it more\r\nbuoyant, they detach themselves, and are driven to a distance by the\r\nrandom motion of the waves. They feed on shrimps, small crabs, whelks,\r\nand similar shelled mollusca, and probably on all animals brought within\r\ntheir reach whose strength or agility is insufficient to extricate them\r\nfrom the grasp of their numerous tentacula; for as these organs can be\r\ninflected in any direction, and greatly lengthened, they are capable of\r\nbeing applied to every point, and adhere by suction with considerable\r\ntenacity, throwing out, according to Gaertner, of their whole surface a\r\nnumber of extremely minute suckers, which, sticking fast to the small\r\nprotuberances of the skin, produce the sensation of roughness, which is\r\nso far from being painful that it even cannot be called disagreeable.\r\n\r\n\"The size of the prey is frequently in unseemly disproportion to the\r\npreyer, being often equal in bulk to itself. I had once brought me a\r\nspecimen of _A. crassicornis_, that might have been originally two\r\ninches in diameter, which had somehow contrived to swallow a valve of\r\n_Pecten maximus_ of the size of an ordinary saucer. The shell, fixed\r\nwithin the stomach, was so placed as to divide it completely into two\r\nhalves, so that the body, stretched tensely over, had become thin and\r\nflattened like a pancake. All communication between the inferior portion\r\nof the stomach and the mouth was of course prevented; yet, instead of\r\nemaciating and dying of atrophy, the animal had availed itself of what\r\nundoubtedly had been a very untoward accident to increase its enjoyment\r\nand its chance of double fare. A new mouth, furnished with two rows of\r\nnumerous tentacula, was opened up on what had been the base, and led to\r\nthe under stomach; the individual had indeed become a sort of Siamese\r\nTwin, but with greater intimacy and extent in its unions!\"\r\n\r\nThe sea anemones pass nearly all their life fixed to some rock, to which\r\nthey seem to have taken root. There they live a sort of unconscious and\r\nobtuse existence, gifted with an instinct so obscure that they are not\r\neven conscious of the prey in their vicinity until it is actually in\r\ncontact, when it seizes it in its mouth and swallows it. Nevertheless,\r\nthough habitually adherent, they can move, gliding and creeping slowly\r\nby successive contractile and relaxing movements of the body, extending\r\none edge of their base and relaxing the opposite one.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of cold weather the _Actiniadæ_ descend into the deepest\r\nwater, where they find a more agreeable temperature.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the sea anemones are scarcely possessed of vital\r\ninstinct; but they are capable of certain voluntary movements. Under the\r\ninfluence of light, they expand their tentacles as the daisy displays\r\nits florets. If the animal is touched, or the water is agitated in its\r\nneighbourhood, the tentacles close immediately. These tentacles appear\r\noccasionally to serve the purpose of offensive arms. The hand of the\r\nman who has touched them becomes red and inflamed. M. Hollard has seen\r\nsmall mackerel, two to three inches long, perish when touched by the\r\ntentacles of the Green Actinia (_Comactis viridis_--Allman). This is a\r\ncharming little animal. \"The brilliancy of its colours and the great\r\nelegance of its tentacular crown when fully expanded,\" says Professor\r\nAllman, \"render it eminently attractive; hundreds may often be seen in a\r\nsingle pool, and few sights will be retained with greater pleasure by\r\nthe naturalist than that presented by these little zoophytes, as they\r\nexpand their green and rosy crowns amid the algæ, millepores, and plumy\r\ncorals, co-tenants of their rock-covered vase.\"\r\n\r\nThe toxological properties of the Actinia have been attributed to\r\ncertain special cells full of liquid; but M. Hollard believes that these\r\neffects are neither constant enough nor sufficiently general to\r\nconstitute the chief function of these organs, which are found in all\r\nthe species and over their whole surface, external and internal. Though\r\nquite incapable of discerning their prey at a distance, the sea anemone\r\nseizes it with avidity when it comes to offer itself up a victim. If\r\nsome adventurous little worm, or some young and sluggish crustacean,\r\nhappens to ruffle the expanded involucrum of an actinia in its lazy\r\nprogress through the water, the animal strikes it at once with its\r\ntentacles, and instinctively sweeps it into its open mouth. This habit\r\nmay be observed in any aquarium, and is a favourite spectacle at the\r\n\"Jardin d'Acclimatation\" of Paris, at noon on Sunday and Wednesday, when\r\nthe aquatic animals are fed. Small morsels of food are thrown into the\r\nwater. Prawns, shrimps, and other crustaceans and zoophytes inhabiting\r\nthis medium, chase the morsels as they sink to the bottom of the basin;\r\nbut it is otherwise with the Actinia; the morsels glide downwards within\r\nthe twentieth part of an inch of their crown without its presence being\r\nsuspected. It requires the aid of a propitious wand, directed by the\r\nhand of the keeper, to guide the food right down on the animal. Then its\r\narms or tentacles seize upon the prey, and its repast commences\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nThe Actinia are at once gluttonous and voracious. They seize their food\r\nwith the help of the tentacula, and engulf in their stomach, as we have\r\nseen, substances of a volume and consistence which contrast strangely\r\nwith their dimensions and softness. In less than an hour, M. Hollard\r\nobserved that one of these creatures voided the shell of a mussel,\r\nand disposed of a crab all to its hardest parts; nor was it slow to\r\nreject these hard parts, by turning its stomach inside out, as one might\r\nturn out one's pocket, in order to empty it of its contents. We have\r\nseen in Dr. Johnston's account of _A. crassicornis_ that when threatened\r\nwith death by hunger, from having swallowed a shell which separated it\r\ninto two halves, at the end of eleven days it had opened a new mouth,\r\nprovided with separate rows of tentacula. The accident which, in\r\nordinary animals, would have left it to perish of hunger, became, in the\r\nsea anemone, the source of redoubled gastronomical enjoyment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate V.--Sea Anemones.\r\n\r\n    1, 2, 3.

Comactis viridis.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\"The anemones,\" Frédol tells us, \"are voracious, and full of energy;\r\nnothing escapes their gluttony; every creature which approaches them is\r\nseized, engulfed, and devoured. Nevertheless, with all the power of\r\ntheir mouth, their insatiable stomachs cannot retain the prey they have\r\nswallowed. In certain circumstances it contrives to escape, in others it\r\nis adroitly snatched away by some neighbouring marauder more cunning and\r\nmore active than the anemone.\"\r\n\r\nIn PL. IV. are represented the principal species of Anemone usually\r\nobserved in the aquarium. Figs. 1, 2, and 3, _A. sulcata_, is surmised\r\nby Johnson to be the young of _A. effoeta_ (Linn.). It is also quoted as\r\na synonyme of _Anthea cereus_, from Drayton's stanza:\r\n\r\n    \"Anthea of the flowers, that hath a general charge,\r\n    And Syrinx of the weeds, that grow upon the marge.\"\r\n\r\nFig. 4, _Phymactis Sanctæ Helenæ_ (Edw.); Fig. 5, _A. Capensis_\r\n(Lesson); Fig. 6, _A. Peruviana_ (Lesson); Fig. 7, _A. Sanctæ\r\nCatherinæ_; Fig. 8, _A. amethystina_ (Quoy); Fig. 9, _Comactis viridis_\r\n(Milne Edwards).\r\n\r\n\"It is sometimes observed in aquariums that a shrimp, which has seen the\r\nprey devoured from a distance, will throw itself upon the ravisher, and\r\naudaciously wrest the prey from him and devour it before his eyes, to\r\nhis great disappointment. Even when the savoury morsel has been\r\nswallowed, the shrimp, by great exertions, succeeds in extracting it\r\nfrom the stomach. Seating itself upon the extended disk of the anemone,\r\nwith its small feet it prevents the approach of the tentacles, at the\r\nsame time that it inserts its claws into the digestive cavity and seizes\r\nthe food. In vain the anemone tries to contract its gills and close its\r\nmouth. Sometimes the conflict between the sedentary zoophyte and the\r\nvagrant crustacean becomes serious. When the former is strong and\r\nrobust, the aggression is repelled, and the shrimp runs the risk of\r\nsupplementing the repast of the anemone.\"\r\n\r\nIf the actinias are voracious, they can also support a prolonged period\r\nof fasting. They have been known to live two and even three years\r\nwithout having received any \"nourishment.\"[7]\r\n\r\nAlthough the sea anemone is said to be delicate eating, man derives very\r\nlittle benefit from them in that respect. In Provence, Italy, and\r\nGreece, the Green Actinia is in great repute, and Dicquemare speaks of\r\n_A. crassicornis_ as delicate food. \"Of all the kinds of sea anemones, I\r\nwould prefer this for the table; being boiled some time in sea water,\r\nthey acquire a firm and palatable consistence, and may then be eaten\r\nwith any kind of sauce. They are of an inviting appearance, of a light\r\nshivering texture, and of a soft white and reddish hue. Their smell is\r\nnot unlike that of a warm crab or lobster.\" Dr. Johnston admits the\r\ntempting description, and does not doubt their being not less a luxury\r\nthan the sea urchins of the Greeks, or the snails of the Roman epicures,\r\nbut he was not induced to test its truth. Rondeletius tells us, having,\r\nas Dr. Johnston thinks, _A. crassicornis_ in view, that it brings a good\r\nprice at Bordeaux. _Actinia dianthus_ also is good to eat, quoth\r\nDicquemare, and Plaucus directs the cook to dress it after the manner of\r\ndressing oysters, with which it is frequently eaten. _Actinia coriacea_\r\nis found in the market at Rochefort during the months of January,\r\nFebruary, and March. Its flesh is said to be both delicate and savoury.\r\n\r\nWith these general considerations, we proceed to note some of the more\r\nremarkable genera and species of these interesting creatures. Among\r\nthese, the species represented in PL. IV. are those usually seen\r\ncollected in such aquariums as those of the Zoological Gardens of London\r\nand the Gardens of Acclimatization of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe first section of the _Actiniadæ_, according to Milne Edwards,\r\nincludes the Common Actinia, the feet of which are broad and adherent,\r\nthe lateral walls soft and imperforate. To this section belongs, among\r\nothers, the genera _Anemonia_, _Actinia_, and _Metridium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VI.--Sea Anemones.\r\n\r\n    1. Actinia dianthus.\r\n    2. Cereus gemmaceus.\r\n    3. Actinia bicolor.\r\n    4. Sagartia viduata.\r\n    5. Cereus papillossus.\r\n    6. Actinia picta.\r\n    7. Actinia equina.\r\n    8. Sagartia rosea.\r\n    9. Sagartia coccinea.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Green Actinia (_A. viridis_) has very numerous tentacula, sometimes\r\nas many as two hundred, exceeding in length the breadth of the body, of\r\na fine brownish or olive green, and rose-coloured at the extremity. The\r\ntrunk is of a greyish green or brown; the disk is brown with greenish\r\nrays. This species is plentiful in the Mediterranean and in the Channel.\r\nWhen attached to the vertical sides of a rock, a little below the\r\nsurface of the water, in which position it is often seen on the shores\r\nof the Mediterranean, the tentacles hang suspended as if the animal had\r\nno power to display them in their radiate form; but when fixed\r\nhorizontally in a calm sea, they are spread out in all directions, and\r\nare kept in a state of continual agitation; its long, mane-like\r\ntentacula, fully expanded, float and balance themselves in the water in\r\nspite of the action of the waves, presenting a most interesting\r\nspectacle as it displays its beauties a few feet below the passing boat.\r\n\r\n_A. dianthus_ (Ellis), having a number of synonymes, is represented in\r\nPL. V. Fig. 1; its body is smooth and cylindrical; the disk marked in\r\nthe centre with clavate radiating bands; tentacula numerous, irregular,\r\nthe outer small, and forming round the margin a thick filamentous\r\nfringe. This species attaches itself to rocks and shells in deep water,\r\nor within low-water mark, to which it permanently attaches itself, and\r\ncannot be removed without organic injury to the base. When contracted,\r\nthe body presents a thick, short, sub-cylindrical form, about three\r\ninches long, and one and a half in diameter, and about five inches when\r\nfully expanded; the skin is smooth, of an uniform olive, whitish, cream,\r\nor flesh colour. The centre of the disk is ornamented with a circle of\r\nwhite bands, radiating from the mouth, the lamellæ running across, the\r\ncircumference being perceptible through the transparent skin. From the\r\nnarrow, colourless interspaces between the lamellæ the tentacula\r\noriginate. \"They are placed,\" says Dr. Johnston, \"between the mouth and\r\nthe margin, which is encircled by a dense fringe of incontestable\r\nbeauty, composed of innumerable short tentacula or filaments, forming a\r\nthick, furry border.\" In PL. V. Fig. 2, we have probably Gaertner's\r\n_Anthea cereus_, the body of which is a light chestnut colour, smooth,\r\nsulcated lengthwise, with tentacula rising from the disk to the number,\r\nin aged animals, of two hundred. _Sagartia viduata_--Gosse (Fig. 4) has\r\nthe body adherent, cylindrical, without a skin, destitute of warts,\r\nemitting capsuliferous filaments from pores; nettling-threads short,\r\ndensely armed with a brush of hairs; tentacles conical. _A. picta_ (PL.\r\nIV. Fig. 6), which Professor Edward Forbes changes to _Adamsia\r\npalliata_, is described by Mr. Adams, who first discovered it, \"as\r\nlongitudinally sulcated, having the edges of the base crenated; the\r\nlower part an obscure red, and the upper part transparent white, marked\r\nwith fine purple spots; the outer circumference of the aperture has a\r\nnarrow stripe of pink. When expanded, the superior division of the body\r\nseems formed of membrane. From perforated warts placed without order on\r\nthe outer coat, issued white filamentous substances variously twisted\r\ntogether. I have observed,\" he adds, \"similar bodies ejected from the\r\nmouths of all the species of this genus which have fallen within my\r\nnotice.\"\r\n\r\n_A. mesembryanthemum_ (Johnston).--The _A. equina_ of Lesson (PL. IV.\r\nFig. 6), known in France as the _Cul d'ane_, is extremely common in the\r\nChannel on rocks between the tide marks. It attaches itself chiefly to\r\nrocks beaten by the waves and exposed to view at the moment of reflux.\r\nThe body is from two to three inches in height, and from an inch to an\r\ninch and a half in diameter; hemispherical when contracted, it resembles\r\na bell perforated at the summit, dilated into a cylinder. When fully\r\nextended the tentacula are nearly equal to the height of the body, of a\r\nuniform liver colour, or olive green, and sometimes streaked with blue,\r\nhaving a greenish line either continuous or in spots, the base generally\r\nof a greenish colour encircled with an azure blue line, often streaked\r\nwith red. The tentacula are terminated by a small pore. Its colour is\r\nvariable, but generally it is of a violet-red. Sometimes it presents\r\nround spots of a fine green; at other times it is only of a greenish\r\nhue; the edge of the feet have a narrow border of red, with green and\r\nblue beneath.\r\n\r\n_Metridium dianthus_ has a thick body with russet grey skin, the disk\r\nstrongly lobed, thin and transparent round the mouth; the tentacula very\r\nnumerous, very short, and occupying a broad, strong zone upon the disk.\r\nThe mesial lines are whitish and wide apart; externally they are closer,\r\npapiliform, and brown. This species is found on stones and shells in the\r\nNorth Sea and in the Channel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe verrucous, or warty section of the _Actiniadæ_, have the lateral\r\nwalls of the body covered with agglutinated tubercles, and\r\nwell-developed feet. To this section belong the Coriaceous Cereus,\r\n_Actinia crassicornis_ (Johnston), and _A. senilis_ (Hollard and\r\nDicquemare), which seem to vary in habit. Hollard describes them as\r\nfrequently buried in the sands on the shore, while Cocks describes them\r\n\"as attaching themselves to shells and stones in deep water, or attached\r\non the littoral to the sides of rocks, in crevices, or on the face of\r\nclean stones in sheltered places.\" The body is variegated, green, and\r\nred; the tentacles thick, short, and greyish, with broad roseate bands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80. Edwardsia Calimorpha (Gosse).]\r\n\r\nThe Anemones belonging to the fourth section, or tap-rooted actinia,\r\nhave the base small, and terminating in a rounded point, and the body\r\nmuch elongated, as in _Edwardsia Calimorpha_ (Fig. 80), in which the\r\nbody is non-adherent, somewhat worm-like, having the mouth and tentacula\r\nseated on a retractile column, the lower extremity inflated, membranous,\r\nand retractile.\r\n\r\nIn the great family of the Actiniarians, Milne Edwards forms a special\r\ngroup of the Phyllactinæ. In this group the polyps are simple, fleshy,\r\nand present at once simple and composite tentacula. Such is _Phyllactis\r\nprætexta_ (Fig. 81), which is found in the neighbourhood of Rio Janeiro.\r\nThe zoophyte fixes itself upon the rocks on the sea shore, and covers\r\nitself with sand. Its trunk, of cylindrical form, is of a flesh-colour,\r\nwith vertical lines, having red points. The interior tentacles form two\r\nsimple elongated rows; the exterior tentacles are spatulate and lobed,\r\nnot very unlike the leaves of the oak.\r\n\r\nAnother group, that of the Thalassianthidæ, is distinguished from the\r\npreceding by having all its tentacula short, pinnate, and branching, or\r\npapilliferous. One species only is known, _T. aster_, of a slate colour,\r\nwhich inhabits the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81. Phyllactus prætexta (Dana), natural size.]\r\n\r\nIn the last group of Actiniadæ, as arranged by Milne Edwards, the\r\npolypes occur in clusters, and are multiplied by buds, rising from a\r\ncommon creeping, root-like, fleshy base; they thus present a sort of\r\ncoriaceous polypier, as in _Zoanthus socialis_ (Fig. 82). In the British\r\nChannel this species, which Dr. Johnston has named _Z. Couchii_, after\r\nMr. Couch, jun., is found along the Cornish coast, on flat slates and\r\nrocks, in deep water, and from one to ten leagues from the shore. It is\r\nvery small, resembling, both in shape and size, a split pea. When\r\nliving, its surface is plain but glandular, becoming corrugated when\r\npreserved. When semi-expanded, which is its favourite state, it elevates\r\nitself to twice its ordinary height, becoming contracted about the\r\nmiddle, like an hour-glass. When the creature is fully expanded, the\r\ntentacula become distended and elongated to about the length of the\r\ntransverse diameter of the body; and they are generally darker at their\r\nextremities than towards the base. Like all the Actiniadæ, the present\r\nspecies possess a power of considerably altering their shape; sometimes\r\nthe mouth is depressed, and at others it is elevated into an obtuse\r\ncone. \"This is one of the most inactive of its order,\" says Mr. A.\r\nCouch; \"for, whether in a state of contraction or expansion, it will\r\nremain so for many days without apparent change. In its expanded state a\r\ntouch will make it contract, and it will commonly remain so for many\r\ndays.\" The trailing connecting-band is flat, thin, narrow, glandular,\r\nand of the same texture as the polyp, sometimes enlarging into small\r\npapillary eminences, which, as they become enlarged, become developed\r\ninto polyps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82. Zoanthus socialis (Cuvier), natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMINYADINIANS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83. Blue Minyade. Minyas coeulea (Cuvier), natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nThe Minyadinians seem to represent among the Zoanthairia the form\r\npeculiar to the Pennatula among the Alcyonians. In the case of these\r\nanimals, the base of the body, in place of extending itself in a\r\ndisk-like form, in order to grapple with the rock and other projections\r\nat the bottom of the sea, turns itself inwards, forming a sort of purse,\r\nwhich seems to imprison the air. From this results a sort of hydrostatic\r\napparatus, aided by which the animals can float in the water and\r\ntransport themselves from one place to another. The Blue Minyade\r\n(_Minyas cyanea_--Fig. 83) will serve as a type of this family; its\r\nglobose, melon-like form is of azure blue, studded with white wart-like\r\nexcrescences; it is flattened at its two extremities in its state of\r\ncontraction, and it has three rows of tentacula, which are short,\r\ncylindrical, and white. The internal organs are of a delicate rose\r\ncolour. Cuvier places this species among the Echinodermata, but the\r\nobservations of Lesueur and Quoy, who were acquainted with the living\r\nanimal, place it among the Actiniadæ. Many of the species, which are\r\nusually fixed, are still capable of swimming and of inflating their\r\nsuctorial disks; therefore it is by no means certain that the free habit\r\nof _Minyas cyanea_ is constant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: \"Cours de Paleontologie Stratigraphique.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"On en a vu vivre deux et même trois ans, sans recevoir de\r\nnourriture.\"--_Vie des Animaux_, p. 117.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nACALEPHÆ, OR SEA NETTLES.\r\n\r\n\"In nova fert animus mutatis dicere formas corpora.\"--OVID, MET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe class Acalephæ, from ἀκαλήφη, a nettle, so called from the\r\nstinging properties which many of them possess, include a great number\r\nof radiate animals of which the Medusæ are the type. They form the third\r\nclass of Cuvier's zoophytes. The Acalephæ, forming the first order, are\r\ncharacterised as floating and swimming in the sea by means of the\r\ncontraction and dilation of their bodies, their substance being\r\ngelatinous, without apparent fibres.\r\n\r\nThe great genus Medusa is characterised by having a disk, more or less\r\nconvex above, resembling a mushroom or expanded umbrella--the edges of\r\nthe umbrella, as well as the mouth and suckers, being more or less\r\nprolonged into pedicles, which take their place in the middle of the\r\nlower surface; they are furnished with tentacula, varying in form and\r\nsize, which have given rise to many subdivisions, with which we need not\r\nconcern ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the disk presents an uniform cellular appearance\r\ninternally, but the cellular substance being very soft, no trace of\r\nfibre is observable. Taken from the sea and laid upon a stone, a Medusa\r\nweighing fifty ounces will rapidly diminish to five or six grains,\r\nsinking into a sort of deliquescence, from which Spalanzani concluded\r\nthat the sea-water penetrated the organic texture of its substance, and\r\nconstituted the principal volume of the animal. Those which have cilia\r\nround their margins have also cellular bands running along their bases,\r\nand most of the projectile and extensile tentacula and filaments have\r\nsacs and canals containing fluids at their roots. Suckers are also found\r\nat the extremities, and along the sides of these tentacles in several\r\ngenera are suckers, by which they are able more securely to catch their\r\nfloating prey, or to anchor themselves when at rest. The indications of\r\nnerves or nervous system are too slight to be received as evidence,\r\nalthough Dr. Grant observed some structure which he thought could only\r\nbelong to a nervous system, and Ehrenberg thought he observed eyes in\r\n_Medusa aurita_, as well as a nervous circle formed of four\r\nganglion-like masses disposed round the mouth. But most naturalists seem\r\nto be of opinion that touch is the only sense of which any conclusive\r\nproof can be advanced.\r\n\r\nHere we behold a class of bell-shaped semi-transparent organisms, which\r\nfloat gracefully in the sea--a great family of soft, wandering animals,\r\nconstituted in a most extraordinary manner. They look like floating\r\numbrellas, breeches, or, better still, floating mushrooms, the footstalk\r\nreplaced by an equally central body, but divided into divergent lobes at\r\nonce sinuous, twisted, and fringed, so that one is at first tempted to\r\ntake them for a species of root. The edges of the umbrella or mushroom\r\nare entire or dentate, sometimes elegantly figured, often ciliate, or\r\nprovided with long filiform appendages which float vertically in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nSometimes the animal is uncoloured, and limpid as crystal; sometimes it\r\npresents a slightly opaline appearance, now of a tender blue, or of a\r\ndelicate rose colour; at other times it reflects the most brilliant and\r\nvivid tints.\r\n\r\nIn certain species the central parts only are coloured, showing\r\nbrilliant reds and yellows, blues or violets, the rest being colourless.\r\nIn others the central mass seems clothed in a thin iridescent or\r\ndiaphanous veil, like the light evanescent soap-bubble, or the\r\ntransparent glass shade which covers a group of artificial flowers.\r\n\r\nThe Acalephæ are animals without consistence, imbued with much water, so\r\nthat we can scarcely comprehend how they resist the agitation of the\r\nwaves and the force of the currents; the waves, however, float without\r\nhurting them, the tempest scatters without killing them. When the sea\r\nretires, or they are withdrawn from their native waters, their substance\r\ndissolves, the animal is decomposed, they are reduced to nothing; if the\r\nsun is ardent, this disorganisation occurs in the twinkling of an eye,\r\nso to speak.\r\n\r\nWhen the Medusæ travel, their convex part is always kept in advance, and\r\nslightly oblique. If they are touched while swimming, even lightly, they\r\ncontract their tentacula, fold up their umbrella, and sink into the sea.\r\nLike Ehrenberg, M. Kölliker thought he discovered visual and auditory\r\norgans in an _Oceania_, and Gegenbauer thought he detected them in other\r\ngenera, such as _Rhizostoma_ and _Pelagia_. The eyes are said to consist\r\nof certain small, hemispherical, cellulose, coloured masses, in which\r\nare sunk small crystalline globules, the free parts of which are\r\nperfectly naked. The supposed auditory apparatus is seated close to\r\nthese organs; they are small vesicles filled with liquid; the eyes\r\nhaving neither pupil nor cornea, and the ears without opening or arch.\r\n\r\nBut it is in their reproduction that these evanescent beings present the\r\nmost marvellous phenomena. At one period of the year the Medusæ are\r\ncharged with numbers of very minute eggs, of the most lively colours,\r\nwhich are suspended in large festoons from their floating bodies. In\r\nsome cases these eggs develop themselves grafted to their bodies, and\r\nare only detached at maturity. In other cases the larvæ produced bear no\r\nresemblance to the mother; they are elongated and vermiform, broad at\r\ntheir extremity; we speak of the microscopic _leeches_, which have\r\nvibrating cilia, scarcely perceptible, by which they execute the most\r\nlively motions. At the end of a certain time they are transformed into\r\npolyps, and furnished with eight tentacula. This preparatory sort of\r\nanimal seems to possess the faculty of reproduction by means of certain\r\nbuds or tubercles which develop themselves on the surface of the body,\r\nand also by filaments which start up here and there, so that a single\r\nindividual originates a numerous colony. This polyp is subjected to a\r\ntransformation still more remarkable; its structure becomes complex, its\r\nbody articulate, and it seems to be composed of a dozen disks piled one\r\nupon the other, like the jars of a voltaic pile; the upper disk is\r\nconvex, and is separated from the colony after a convulsive effort; it\r\nbecomes free, and an excessively small, star-like Medusa is the result;\r\nevery disk, that is, every individual, is isolated one after the other\r\nin the same manner.\r\n\r\nThus of the sexual zoophytes which propagate their kind according to the\r\nusual laws; but others engender young which have no resemblance to the\r\nparent zoophyte at all: in this respect they are neuter, that is,\r\nnon-sexual, or _agamous_. These are produced by budding, or fissiparity,\r\nfrom individuals like themselves. They can also give sexual\r\ndistinctions; but before this change takes place the creature, which was\r\nsimple, is transformed into a composite animal, and it is from its\r\ndisaggregation that individuals having sexual organs are produced, the\r\nprocess being that which has been called _alternate_ generation. It goes\r\non in a perfectly regular manner, although it is a fact that the young\r\nnever resemble their mothers, but their grandmothers.\r\n\r\nThis great family of Zoophytes Gosse divides into--\r\n\r\n_Discophora_, having the body in the form of a circular disk, more or\r\nless convex and umbrella-shaped, moving by alternate contractions and\r\nexpansions of the disk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84. Æquerea violacea, natural size (Milne Edwards).]\r\n\r\n_Ctenophora_, body cylindrical, moving by means of many parallel rims of\r\ncilia set in longitudinal lines on the surface.\r\n\r\n_Sophonophora_, body irregular, without central digestive cavity like\r\nthe others, having sucking organs, and moving by means of a contractile\r\ncavity, or by air-vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85. Aurelia aurita (Lamarck). Cyanea aurita\r\n(Cuvier). One-third natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe Discophora are again subdivided into _Gymnophthalmata_, having the\r\neye-specks uncovered or wanting, a great central digestive cavity,\r\ncirculating vessels proceeding to the margin quite simple or branched;\r\nand _Steganophthalmata_ having the eye-specks protected by membranous\r\nhoods, or lobed coverings, circulating vessels much ramified, and united\r\nwith a network. Of the Gymnophthalmata we have an example in _Æquerea\r\nviolacea_ (Fig. 84), in which the disk is slightly convex, glass-like in\r\nappearance, and furnished all round with very short, slender,\r\nthread-like, violet-coloured tentacula; with circulating vessels, eight\r\nin number, quite simple, and ovaries placed on them; peduncle wide,\r\nexpanding into many broad and long fringed lobes. The Steganophthalmata\r\ninclude the _Medusadæ_ proper, in which the umbel is hemispherical, with\r\nnumerous marginal tentacles, eight eyes covered by lobes, four ovaries,\r\nfour chambers, four fringed arms, with a central and four lateral\r\nopenings. _Aurelia aurita_ (Fig. 85) is here represented as a type of\r\nthe group; it is plentiful in the Baltic, and has been carefully studied\r\nby the Swedish naturalists. Rosenthal has made its anatomy his special\r\nstudy. Sars has also made it the subject of observations. In the same\r\ngroup we find the _Pelagia cyanella_ of Péron, whose body is globose,\r\nscolloped with eight marginal tentacles, peduncles ending in four\r\nleaf-like, furbelowed arms, united at the base, having four ovaries, and\r\nappendages to the stomach, without orifices.\r\n\r\nThe _Pelagia_, as the name implies, belong to the deep sea. _P.\r\nnoctiluca_ has a transparent, glass-like disk, of a reddish-brown colour\r\nand warty appearance. It is found in the Mediterranean, about the coast\r\nnear Nice, and is still more plentiful on the coast of Sicily, and on\r\nthe African coast. Another species, _P. panopyra_, is very common in the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific, between the Tropics. The naturalist Lesson met\r\nwhole banks of them in the equatorial ocean, about the twenty-seventh\r\ndegree north latitude and the twenty-second degree west longitude.\r\nDuring the night, this species emits a brilliant phosphoric light, and\r\nliving individuals, which Lesson succeeded in preserving, exhibited\r\ngreat luminosity in the dark. This medusa is remarkable for its\r\nsemi-spherical disk, slightly depressed, umbilicate at the summit, a\r\nlittle compressed at the edges, and densely bristling on the surface\r\nwith small elongated warts, but regularly festooned along the edges. In\r\ncolour it is a delicate rose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe animals which constitute this class of Zoophytes, and, in former\r\ntimes, so curious and so imperfectly known, were designated\r\n_Polypomedusæ_, in order to remind us that at one time they were called\r\nMedusæ, and at others ranged among the Polyps. It has, however, been\r\nrecently discovered that, shortly after they issue from the egg, these\r\nzoophytes show themselves in the form of polyps, and that, at a later\r\nperiod, they assume the animal form, to which we give the name of\r\nmedusæ. These animals are, then, true proteans: hence the very\r\nconsiderable difficulty of studying them--difficulties which have long\r\nreduced naturalists to despair. Even now their history is too obscure\r\nand too complicated to justify us in presenting it, except in its\r\ngeneral features. We shall, therefore, content ourselves here with a\r\ndescription of the best known species of the class only--those, namely,\r\nwhich have particularly attracted the attention of naturalists, and\r\nwhich are, at the same time, of a nature to interest our readers.\r\n\r\nThe class of Discophoræ may be divided into four orders or families,\r\nnamely:--\r\n\r\n     I. THE HYDRAIDÆ, having single, naked, gelatinous, sub-cylindrical,\r\n     but very contractile stems, mutable in form, mouth encircled with\r\n     a single series of granulous filiform tentacula.\r\n\r\n     II. SERTULARIADÆ, plant-like and horny, rooted and variously\r\n     branched, filled with semi-fluid organic pulp, the polyps contained\r\n     within sessile cells disposed along the sides of the main stem or\r\n     branchlets, but never terminal.\r\n\r\n     III. MEDUSADÆ. Umbel hemispherical, with marginal tentacula; having\r\n     eight eyes covered by lobes, four ovaries, four cells, four fringed\r\n     arms, a central opening, and four lateral openings.\r\n\r\n     IV. SIPHONOPHORA, having the animals double, and bell-shaped, one\r\n     fitting into the cavity of the other; in _Dyphyes_ the animal has a\r\n     large air-vessel with numerous tentacula; in _Physalia_, the animal\r\n     stretches over a cartilaginous plane.\r\n\r\n     The true form of the Medusa does not appear in the two first\r\n     orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRAIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe Hydraidæ are, according to modern naturalists, Discophoræ arrested\r\nin their development. They comprehend the single genus Hydra, of which\r\nmany species are known, whose habits and metamorphoses it will be our\r\nobject to particularise.\r\n\r\n_Hydra vulgaris_ inhabits stagnant ponds and slowly-running waters. It\r\nis of an orange-brown or red colour, the intensity of the colour\r\ndepending on the nature of its food, becoming almost blood-red when fed\r\non the small crimson worms and larvæ to be found in such places. M.\r\nLaurent even succeeded in colouring them blue, red, and white, by means\r\nof indigo, carmine, and chalk, without any real penetration of the\r\ntissue, the buds from them acquiring the same colour as the mother,\r\nwhile the colour of the ova retains its natural tint, even when the\r\nHydra mother has been fed with coloured substances during the progress\r\nof this mode of reproduction. The tentacula, usually seven or eight in\r\nnumber, never exceed the length of the body, tapering insensibly to a\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n_Hydra viridis_, the fresh-water polyp, being more immediately within\r\nthe sphere of our observation, naturally presents itself to our notice.\r\nIt is common in ponds and still waters. It was noticed by Pallas, who\r\nwas of opinion that offspring was produced from every part of the body.\r\nDe Blainville, on the contrary, was of opinion that offspring was always\r\nproduced from the same place; namely, at the junction of that part which\r\nis hollow and that which is not. Van der Höven, the Leyden professor,\r\nagrees with Pallas, and Dr. Johnston's opinions accord with Pallas. The\r\ngreen Hydra is common all over Europe, inhabiting brooks filled with\r\nherbage--attaching itself particularly to the duckweed of stagnant\r\nponds, and more especially to the under surface of the leaf. The animal\r\nis reduced to a small greenish tubular sac, closed at one of its\r\nextremities, open at the other, and bearing round this opening from six\r\nto ten appendages, very slender, and not exceeding a line in breadth.\r\nThe tubulous sac is the body of the animal (Fig. 87). The opening is at\r\nonce its mouth and the entrance to the digestive canal; the appendages,\r\nthe tentacula or arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86. Hydra vulgaris. 1. Hydra with ova and young,\r\nunhatched. 2. Hydra of natural size attached to a piece of floating\r\nwood. 3. Egg ready to burst its shell.]\r\n\r\nThe Hydras have no lungs, no liver, no intestines, no nervous system, no\r\nheart. They have no organ of the senses, except those which exist in the\r\nmouth and the skin. The arms or branches are hollow internally, and\r\ncommunicate with the stomach. They are provided with vibratile cells,\r\nfurnished with a great number of tuberosities disposed spirally, and\r\ncontaining in their interior a number of capsules provided each with a\r\nsort of fillet. These threads, which are of extreme tenacity, are thrown\r\nout when the animal is irritated by contact with any strange body. We\r\nmay see these filaments wrapping themselves round their prey, sometimes\r\neven penetrating its substance, and effectually subduing the enemy. The\r\ngreen Hydra has thus a very simple organisation. Nevertheless, it would\r\nbe a mistake to say the animal was imperfect, for it possesses\r\neverything necessary for its nourishment and for the propagation of its\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87. Hydra viridis (Trembley). 1. Hydra magnified,\r\nbearing an embryo ready to detach itself. 2. Animal, natural size. 3.\r\nBud much magnified. 4. Bud, natural size.]\r\n\r\nThere are learned men who have composed hundreds of volumes, who have\r\npublished whole libraries--naturalists and physicists who have written\r\nmore than Voltaire ever penned, but whose names are utterly forgotten.\r\nOn the other hand, there are some who have left only two or three\r\nmonograms, and yet their names will live for ever. Of this number is the\r\nGenevois, A. Trembley. This writer published in 1744 a \"Memoir on the\r\nFresh-water Polyps.\" In this little work he recorded his observations\r\non some of these animals of smallest dimensions. He limited himself even\r\nto two sets of experiments: he turned the fresh-water polyp outside in,\r\nand he multiplied it by cutting it up. These experiments upon this\r\nlittle creature, which few persons had seen, have sufficed to secure\r\nimmortality to his name. Trembley was tutor to the two sons of Count de\r\nBentinck. He made his observations at the country-house of the Dutch\r\nnobleman, and he had, as he assures us, \"frequent occasion to satisfy\r\nhimself, in the case of his two pupils, that we can even in infancy\r\ntaste the pleasures derivable from the studies of Nature!\" Let us hope\r\nthat this thought, uttered by a celebrated naturalist, who spoke only\r\nfrom what he knew himself, may remain engraved on the minds of our\r\nyounger readers.\r\n\r\nTrembley established by his observations, a thousand times repeated,\r\nthat _Hydra viridis_ can be turned outside in, as completely as a glove\r\nmay be, without injury to the animal, which a day or two after this\r\nrevolution resumes its ordinary functions. Such is the vitality of these\r\nlittle beings, that what was once the outer surface soon fulfils all the\r\nfunctions of a stomach, digesting its food, while the intestinal tube\r\nexpanding its exterior performs all the functions of an outer surface;\r\nit absorbs and respires. But we shall leave Trembley to relate his very\r\nremarkable experiments. \"I attempted,\" he says, \"for the first time to\r\nturn these polyps inside out in the month of July, 1741 but\r\nunsuccessfully. I was more successful the following year, having found\r\nan expedient which was of easy execution. I began by giving a worm to\r\nthe polyp, and put it, when the stomach was well filled, into a little\r\nwater which filled the hollow of my left hand. I pressed it afterwards\r\nwith a gentle pinch towards the posterior extremities. In this manner I\r\npressed the worm which was in the stomach against the mouth of the\r\npolyp, forcing it to open--continuing the pinching pressure until the\r\nworm was partly pressed out of the mouth. When the polyp was in this\r\nstate I conducted it gently out of the water, without damaging it, and\r\nplaced it upon the edge of my hand, which was simply moistened, in order\r\nthat the polyp should not stick to it. I forced it to contract itself\r\nmore and more, and, in doing so, assisted in enlarging the mouth and\r\nstomach. I now took in my right hand a thick and pointless boar's\r\nbristle, which I held as a lancet is held in bleeding. I approached its\r\nthicker end to the posterior extremity of the polyp, which I pressed\r\nuntil it entered the stomach, which it does the more easily since it is\r\nempty at this place and much enlarged. I continued to advance the\r\nbristle, and, in proportion as it advanced, the polyp became more and\r\nmore inverted. When it came to the worm, by which the mouth is kept open\r\non one side, and the posterior part of the polyp is passed through the\r\nmouth, the creature is thus turned completely inside out; the exterior\r\nsuperficies of the polyp has become the interior.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor animal would be justified in feeling some surprise at its new\r\nsituation--disagreeably surprised we may add, for it makes every\r\nimaginable effort to recover its natural position, and it always\r\nsucceeds in the end. The glove is restored to its proper form. \"I have\r\nseen polyps,\" says Trembley, \"which have recovered their natural\r\nexterior in less than an hour.\" But this would not have served the\r\npurpose of our experimenter. He wished to know if the polyps thus turned\r\noutside in could live in this state; he had consequently to prevent it\r\nfrom rectifying itself, for which purpose a needle was run through the\r\nbody near the mouth--in other words, he impaled the creature by the\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing for a polyp only to be spitted,\" says Trembley. It is in\r\nfact a very small thing, as we shall see, for thus reversed and spitted\r\nthey live and multiply as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen a polyp,\" says this ingenious experimenter, \"turned inside\r\nout, which has eaten a small worm two days after the operation. I have\r\nfed one in that state for more than two years, and it has multiplied in\r\nthat condition.\r\n\r\n\"Having experimented successfully myself, I was desirous of having the\r\ntestimony of others capable of forming opinions on the subject. M.\r\nAllamand was persuaded to put his hand to the work, which he did with\r\nthe same success I had met with. He has done more, having succeeded in\r\npermanently turning specimens which had been previously turned, and\r\nwhich continued to live in their re-inverted state; he has seen them eat\r\nsoon after both operations; finally, he has turned one for the third\r\ntime, which lived some days, but perished without having eaten anything,\r\nalthough it did not appear that its death was the result of the\r\noperation.\"\r\n\r\nWe have said that the _Hydra viridis_ has neither brain, nervous system,\r\nheart, muscular rings, lungs, nor liver; the organs of the\r\nsenses--namely, those of sight, hearing, and of smell--have also been\r\ndenied them. Nevertheless, they act as if they possessed all these\r\nsenses. Oh Nature! how hidden are thy secrets, and how the pride of man\r\nis humbled by the mysteries which surround thee--by the spectacles which\r\nstrike his eyes, and which he attempts in vain to explain!\r\n\r\nTrembley states that the fresh-water polyps, having no muscular ring,\r\ncan neither extend nor contract themselves, nor can they walk. If\r\ntouched, or if the water in which they are immersed is suddenly\r\nagitated, they are certainly observed to contract more or less forcibly,\r\nand even to inflect themselves in all directions; and by this power of\r\nextension, of contraction and inflection, they contrive to move from\r\nplace to place; but these movements are singularly slow, the utmost\r\nspace they have been observed to traverse being about eight inches in\r\nthe twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nPainfully conscious of his powers of progression, however, he has found\r\nmeans of remedying it, and the aquatic snail is his steed; he creeps\r\nupon the shell of a Planorbis, or Limnæa, and by means of this\r\nimprovised mount he will make more way in a few minutes than he would in\r\na day by his own unassisted efforts.\r\n\r\nThe _Hydra viridis_, although destitute of organs of sight, are\r\nnevertheless sensible of light; if the vase containing them is placed\r\npartly in shade and partly in the sun, they direct themselves\r\nimmediately towards the light; they appreciate sounds; they attach\r\nthemselves to aquatic plants and other floating bodies. Without eyes,\r\nwithout brain, and without nerves, these animals lie in wait for their\r\nprey, recognize, seize, and devour it. They make no blunder, and only\r\nattack where they are sure of success. They know how to flee from\r\ndanger; they evade obstacles, and fight with or fly before their\r\nenemies. There are, then, some powers of reflection, deliberation, and\r\npremeditated action in these insignificant creatures; their history, in\r\nshort, is calculated to fill the mind with astonishment.\r\n\r\nTrembley insists much upon the address which the Hydra employs to secure\r\nits prey: by the aid of its long arms, small animals, which serve to\r\nnourish it, are seized, for it is carnivorous, and even passably\r\nvoracious. Worms, small insects, and larvæ of dipterous insects are its\r\nhabitual prey. When a worm or woodlouse in passing its portals happens\r\nto touch them, the polyp, taking the hint, seizes upon the wanderer,\r\ntwining its flexible arms round it, and, directing it rapidly towards\r\nits mouth, swallows it. Trembley amused himself by feeding the Hydra,\r\nwhile he observed the manner in which it devoured its prey. \"When its\r\narms were extended, I have put into the water a woodlouse or a small\r\nworm. As soon as the woodlouse feels itself a prisoner it struggles\r\nviolently, swimming about, and drawing the arm which holds it from side\r\nto side; but, however delicate it may appear, the arm of the polyp is\r\ncapable of considerable resistance; it is now gradually drawn in, and\r\nother arms come to its assistance, while the polyp itself approaches its\r\nprey; presently the woodlouse finds itself engaged with all the arms,\r\nwhich, by curving and contracting, gradually but inevitably approach the\r\nmouth, in which it is soon engulfed.\" Frédol also notices a singular\r\nfact. \"The small worms, even when swallowed by the polyp,\" he says,\r\n\"frequently try to escape; but the ravisher retains them by plunging one\r\nof its arms into the digestive cavity! What an admirable contrivance, by\r\nwhich the worms are digested while the arm is respected!\"\r\n\r\nThe food of the fresh-water Hydra influences the colour of their bodies\r\nin consequence of the thinness and transparency of their tissues; so\r\nthat the reddish matter of the woodlouse renders them red, while other\r\nfood renders them black or green, according to its prevailing colour!\r\n\r\nThe multiplication of these creatures takes place in three different\r\nways: 1. By eggs. 2. By buds, after the manner of vegetables. 3. By\r\nseparation, in which an individual may be cut into two or many segments,\r\neach reproducing an individual.\r\n\r\nWe shall only say a few words on the first mode of reproduction. The\r\neggs, according to Ehrenberg, come to maturity in the _H. viridis_ at\r\nthe base of the feet, where the visceral cavity terminates. They are\r\ncarried during seven or eight days, and determine by their fall the\r\ndeath of the animal. When the Hydra has laid its eggs, according to M.\r\nLaurent, it gradually lowers itself until it covers them with half its\r\nbody, which, spreading out and getting proportionably thin, passes into\r\nthe condition of a horny substance, that glues the eggs disposed in a\r\ncircle round the body to plants and other foreign substances. She ends\r\nher career by dying in the midst of her ova.\r\n\r\nTrembley has studied with great care the mode of reproduction by\r\nbudding--a process which seems to prevail in the summer months. The buds\r\nwhich are to form the young polyp appear on the surface of the body as\r\nlittle spherical excrescences terminating in a point. A few steps\r\nfurther towards maturity, and it assumes a conical and finally a\r\ncylindrical form. The arms now begin to push out at the anterior\r\nextremity of the young animal; the posterior extremity by which it is\r\nattached to the mother contracting by degrees, until it appears only to\r\ntouch her at one point. Finally, the separation is effected, the mother\r\nand the young acting in concert to produce the entrance of this\r\ninteresting young polyp into the world. Each of them take with their\r\nhead and arms a strong point of support upon some neighbouring body; and\r\na small effort suffices to procure the separation: sometimes the mother\r\ncharges herself with the effort, sometimes the young, and often both.\r\n\r\nWhen the young polyp is separated from the mother, it swims about, and\r\nexecutes all the movements peculiar to adult animals. The entrance into\r\nlife and maturity takes place with these beings at one and the same\r\nmoment. Infancy and youth are suppressed in this little world.\r\n\r\nSo long as the young polyp remains attached to the mother, she is the\r\nnurse; by a touching change, the young polyp nurses her in his turn. In\r\nshort, the stomach of the mother and her young have communication; so\r\nthat the prey swallowed by the parent passes partially into the stomach\r\nof her progeny. On the other hand, while still attached to the mother,\r\nthe little ones seize the prey, which they share in their turn with\r\ntheir parent by means of the communication Nature has arranged between\r\nthe two organisms.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his experiments Trembley states another fact still more\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nUpon a young polyp still attached to its parent he observed a new polyp\r\nor polypule, and upon this unborn creature was another individual. Thus\r\nthree generations were appended to the parent, who carried at once her\r\nchild, her grandchild, and great-grandchild.\r\n\r\n\"In observing the young polyps still attached to their parent,\" says\r\nTrembley, \"I have seen one which had itself a little one which was just\r\nissuing from its body; that is to say, it was a mother while yet\r\nattached to its own parent. I had in a short time many young polyps\r\nattached to their parents which had already had three or four little\r\nones, of which some were even perfectly formed. They fished for woodlice\r\nlike others, and they ate them. Nor is this all. I have seen a\r\nmother-polyp which had carried its _third generation_. From the little\r\none which she had produced issued another little one, and from this a\r\nthird.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Bennet, the naturalist of Geneva, says wittily, that a polyp\r\nthus charged with all its descendants constitutes a living genealogical\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nWe have just spoken of turning polyps inside out! If one of these\r\ncreatures is thus operated upon while it bears its young on the surface\r\nof its body, such of them as are sufficiently advanced continue to\r\nincrease; although they find themselves in this sudden manner imprisoned\r\nin an internal cavity, they re-issue subsequently by the mouth. Those\r\nless advanced at the moment of reversal issue by little and little from\r\nthe maternal sac, and complete their career of development on the\r\nnewly-made exterior.\r\n\r\nThe third and most extraordinary mode of reproduction in the polyps has\r\nbeen discovered by Trembley in the case of the green Hydra. So surprised\r\nwas this naturalist at the strange anomalies which surrounded these\r\ncreatures, that he began to have doubts, and gravely to ask the\r\nquestion, Was this polyp an animal? Is it a plant?\r\n\r\nIn order to escape from this state of indecision, it occurred to him to\r\ncut a Hydra into pieces. Concluding that plants alone could reproduce\r\nthemselves by slips, he waited the result of the experiment for the\r\nconclusion he sought. On the 25th of November, 1740, he cut a polyp into\r\nsections. \"I put,\" he tells us, \"the two parts into a flat glass, which\r\ncontained water four or five lines in depth, and in such a manner that\r\neach portion of the polyp could be easily observed through a strong\r\nmagnifying glass. It will suffice to say that I had cut the polyp\r\ntransversely, and a little nearer to the anterior. On the morning of the\r\nday after having cut the polyp, it seemed to me that on the edges of the\r\nsecond part, which had neither head nor arms, three small points were\r\nissuing from these edges. This surprised me extremely, and I waited with\r\nimpatience for the moment when I could clearly ascertain what they were.\r\nNext day they were sufficiently developed to leave no doubt on my mind\r\nthat they were true arms. The following day two new arms made their\r\nappearance, and, some days after, a third appeared, and I could now\r\ntrace no difference between the first and second half of the polyp which\r\nI had cut.\"\r\n\r\nThis is assuredly one of the most startling facts belonging to natural\r\nhistory. Divide a fresh-water polyp into five or six parts, and at the\r\nend of a few days all the separate parts will be organized, developed,\r\nand form so many new beings, resembling the primitive individual. Let us\r\nadd, that the polyp which should thus have lost five-sixths of its body,\r\nthe mutilated father of all this generation, remains complete in itself;\r\nin the interval, it has recuperated itself and recovered all its\r\nprimitive substance.\r\n\r\nAfter this, if a _Hydra vulgaris_ wishes to procure for itself the\r\nblessings of a family, it has only one thing to do: cut off an arm; if\r\nit desire two descendants, let it cut the arm in two parts; if three,\r\nlet it divide itself into three; and so on _ad infinitum_. \"Divide one\r\nof the animals,\" says Trembley, \"and each section will soon form a new\r\nindividual in all respects like the creature divided.\" \"A whole host of\r\npolyps hewn into pieces,\" says Frédol, \"will be far from being\r\nannihilated.\" \"On the contrary,\" we may say, in our turn, \"its youth\r\nwill be renewed, and multiplied in proportion to the number of pieces\r\ninto which it has been divided.\" \"The same polyp,\" says Trembley, \"may\r\nbe successively inverted, cut into sections, and turned back again,\r\nwithout being seriously injured.\"\r\n\r\nIf a green Hydra is cut into two pieces, and the stomach is cut off in\r\nthe operation, the voracious creature will, nevertheless, continue to\r\neat the prey which presents itself. It gorges itself with the food,\r\nwithout troubling itself with the loss which it has sustained; but the\r\nfood no longer nourishes it, for it merely enters by one opening, passes\r\nthrough the intestinal canal, and escapes by the other. It realizes\r\nHarleville's pleasantry of M. de Crac's horse, in the piece of that\r\nname, which eats unceasingly, but never gets any fatter.\r\n\r\nAll these instances of mutilation, resulting in an increase of life, are\r\nvery strange. The naturalists to whom they were first revealed could\r\nscarcely believe their own eyes. Réaumur, who repeated many of\r\nTrembley's experiments, writes as follows: \"I confess that when I saw\r\nfor the first time two polyps forming by little and little from that\r\nwhich I had cut in two, I could scarcely believe my eyes; and it is a\r\nfact that, after hundreds of experiments, I never could quite reconcile\r\nmyself to the sight.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, we know nothing analogous to it in the animal kingdom. About\r\nthe same period Charles Bennet writes: \"We can only judge of things by\r\ncomparison, and have taken our ideas of animal life from the larger\r\nanimals; and an animal which we cut and turn inside out, which we cut\r\nagain, and it still bears itself well, gives one a singular shock. How\r\nmany facts are ignored, which will come one day to derange our ideas of\r\nsubjects which we think we understand! At present we just know enough to\r\nbe aware that we should be surprised at nothing.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the philosophic serenity which Bennet recommends, the\r\nfact of new individuals resulting from dividing these fresh-water polyps\r\nwas always a subject of profound astonishment, and of never-ending\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERTULARIADÆ.\r\n\r\nAll Hydraidæ, with the exception of the Hydra and a few other genera,\r\nare marine productions, varying from a few lines to upwards of a foot in\r\nheight, attaching themselves to rocks, shells, sea-weeds, and\r\ncorallines, and to various species of shell-fish. Many of them attach\r\nthemselves indiscriminately to the nearest object, but others show a\r\ndecided preference. _Thuiaria thrya_ attaches itself to old bivalves;\r\n_Thoa halecuia_ prefers the larger univalves; _Antennularia antennina_\r\nattaches itself to coarse sand on rocks; _Laomedea geniculata_ delights\r\nin the broad frond of the tangle; _Plumularia catherina_ attaches itself\r\nin deep water to old shells, corallines, and ascidians, growing in a\r\nmanner calculated to puzzle the naturalist, as it did Crabbe, the poet,\r\nwho writes of it:--\r\n\r\n    \"Involved in sea-wrack, here you find a race\r\n    Which science, doubting, knows not where to place;\r\n    On shell or stone is dropp'd the embryo seed,\r\n    And quickly vegetates a vital breed.\"\r\n\r\n_Sertularia pumila_, on the other hand, loves the commoner and coarser\r\nwracks. \"The choice,\" says Dr. Johnston, \"may in part be dependent on\r\ntheir habits, for such as are destined to live in shallow water, or on a\r\nshore exposed by the reflux of every tide, are, in general, vegetable\r\nparasites; while the species which spring up in deep seas must select\r\nbetween rocks, corallines, or shells.\" There seems to be a selection\r\neven as to the position on the rocks. According to Lamouroux, some\r\npolyps always occupy the southern slopes, and never that towards the\r\neast, west, or north; others, on the contrary, grow only on these\r\nexposures, and never on the south, altering their position, however,\r\naccording to the latitude, and its relation to the Equator.\r\n\r\nThe _Sertulariadæ_ have a horny stem, sometimes simple, sometimes so\r\nbranching that they might readily enough be mistaken for small plants,\r\ntheir branches being flexible, semi-transparent, and yellow. Their name\r\nis derived from _Sertum_, a bouquet. Each Sertularia has seven, eight,\r\ntwelve, or twenty small panicles, each containing as many as five\r\nhundred animalcules; thus forming, sometimes, an association of ten\r\nthousand polyps. \"Each plume,\" says Mr. Lister, in reference to a\r\nspecimen of _Plumularia cristata_, \"might comprise from four to five\r\nhundred polyps;\" \"and a specimen of no unusual size now before me,\" says\r\nDr. Johnston, \"with certainly not fewer cells on each than the larger\r\nnumber mentioned, thus giving six thousand as the tenantry of a single\r\npolypidom, and this on a small species.\" On _Sertularia argentea_, it is\r\nasserted, polyps are found on which there exist not less than eighty to\r\na hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nEach colony is composed of a right axis, on the whole length of which\r\nthe curved branches are implanted, these being longest in the middle.\r\nAlong each of these branches the cells, each containing a polyp, are\r\ngrouped alternately. The head of the animal is conical, the mouth being\r\nat the top surrounded by twenty to twenty-four tentacles. These curious\r\nbeings have no digestive cavity belonging to themselves; the stomach is\r\ncommon to the whole colony--a most singular combination, a single\r\nstomach to a whole group of animals! Never have the principles of\r\nassociation been pushed to this length by the warmest advocates of\r\ncommunism.\r\n\r\nCertain species belonging to the colony, which seem destined to\r\nperpetuate the race, have not the same regular form. Destitute of mouth\r\nand tentacles, they occupy special cells, which are larger than the\r\nothers. The entire colony is composed exclusively of individuals, male\r\nor female. \"We have traced _Sertularia cupressina_ through every stage\r\nof its development,\" say Messrs. Paul Gervais and Van Beneden. \"At the\r\nend of several days, the embryos are covered with very short vibratile\r\ncells; their movement is excessively slow; then, from the spheroid form\r\nwhich they take at first, they get elongated, and take a cylindrical\r\nform, all the body inclining lightly sometimes to the right, sometimes\r\nto the left. The vibratile cells fading afterwards, the embryo attaches\r\nitself to some solid body, a tubercle is formed, and the base extends\r\nitself as a disk. At the same time that the first rudiments of the polyp\r\nappear, the disk-like tubercle throws out on its flanks a sort of bud,\r\nand a second polyp soon shows itself; its surface is hardened; the polyp\r\nappears in its turn, and the same process of generation is repeated; a\r\ncolony of _Sertulariadæ_ is thus established at the summit of a discoid\r\nprojection. At the end of fifteen days the colony, which has been\r\nforming under our eyes, consists of two polyps and a bud, which already\r\nindicates a third polyp. The sea-cypress, as this species is called, is\r\nrobust, with longish branches decidedly fan-shaped, the pinnæ being\r\ncloser and nearly parallel to each other. The cells form two rows,\r\nnearly opposite, smooth and pellucid. The branches in some specimens are\r\ngracefully arched, bending as it were under the load of pregnant ovaries\r\nwhich they carry, arranged in close-set rows along the upper side of the\r\npinnæ. They are found in deep water on the coast of Scotland, and as far\r\nsouth as the Yorkshire coast and the north of Ireland. The cells, which\r\nare the abode of the polyps, are not always alike in their distribution.\r\nSometimes they are ranged on two sides, sometimes on one only. Sometimes\r\nthey are grouped like the small tubes of an organ, at other times they\r\nassume a spiral form round the stem, or they form here and there\r\nhorizontal rings round it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDUSADÆ.\r\n\r\nThe Medusæ comprehend, not only the animals so designated in the days of\r\nCuvier under that name, but also the polyps known as _Tubulariadæ_ and\r\n_Campanulariadæ_.\r\n\r\nIf we walk along the sea shore, after the reflux of the tide, we may\r\noften see, lying immovable upon the sands, disk-like, gelatinous masses\r\nof a greenish colour and repulsive appearance, from which the eye and\r\nthe steps instinctively turn aside. These beings, whose blubber-like\r\nappearance inspires only feelings of disgust when seen lying grey and\r\ndead on the shore, are, however, when seen floating on the bosom of the\r\nocean, one of its most graceful ornaments. These are Medusæ. When seen\r\nsuspended like a piece of gauze or an azure bell in the middle of the\r\nwaves, terminating in delicate silvery garlands, we cannot but admire\r\ntheir iridescent colours, or deny that these objects, so forbidding in\r\nsome of their aspects, rank, in their natural localities, among the\r\nmost elegant productions of Nature. We could not better commence our\r\nstudies of these children of the sea than by quoting a passage from the\r\npoet and historian Michelet: \"Among the rugged rocks and lagunes, where\r\nthe retiring sea has left many little animals which were too sluggish or\r\ntoo weak to follow, some shells will be there left to themselves and\r\nsuffered to become quite dry. In the midst of them, without shell and\r\nwithout shelter, extended at our feet, lies the animal which we call by\r\nthe very inappropriate name of the _Medusa_. Why was this name, of\r\nterrible associations, given to a creature so charming? Often have I had\r\nmy attention arrested by these castaways which we see so often on the\r\nshore. They are small, about the size of my hand, but singularly pretty,\r\nof soft light shades, of an opal white; where it lost itself as in a\r\ncloud of tentacles--a crown of tender lilies--the wind had overturned\r\nit; its crown of lilac hair floated about, and the delicate umbel, that\r\nis, its proper body, was beneath; it had touched the rock--dashed\r\nagainst it; it was wounded, torn in its fine locks, which are also its\r\norgans of respiration, absorption, and even of love.... The delicious\r\ncreature, with its visible innocence and the iridescence of its soft\r\ncolours, was left like a gliding, trembling jelly. I paused beside it,\r\nnevertheless: I glided my hand under it, raised the motionless body\r\ncautiously, and restored it to its natural position for swimming.\r\nPutting it into the neighbouring water, it sank to the bottom, giving no\r\nsign of life. I pursued my walk along the shore, but at the end of ten\r\nminutes I returned to my Medusa. It was undulating under the wind;\r\nreally it had moved itself, and was swimming about with singular grace,\r\nits hair flying round it as it swam; gently it retired from the rock,\r\nnot quickly, but still it went, and I soon saw it a long way off.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the zoophytes which live in the ocean there is none more numerous\r\nin species or more singular in their matter, more odd in their form, or\r\nmore remarkable in their mode of reproduction, than those to which\r\nLinnæus gave the name of Medusa, from the mythical chief of the Gorgons.\r\n\r\nThe seas of every latitude of the globe furnish various tribes of these\r\nsingular beings. They live in the icy waters which bathe Spitzbergen,\r\nGreenland, and Iceland; they multiply under the fires of the Equator,\r\nand the frozen regions of the south nourish numerous species. They are,\r\nof all animals, those which present the least solid substance. Their\r\nbodies are little else than water, which is scarcely retained by an\r\nimperceptible organic network; it is a transparent jelly, almost without\r\nconsistence. \"It is a true sea-water jelly,\" says Réaumur, writing in\r\n1701, \"having little colour or consistence. If we take a morsel in our\r\nhands, the natural heat is sufficient to dissolve it into water.\"\r\n\r\nSpallanzani could only withdraw five or six grains of the pellicle of a\r\nmedusa weighing fifty ounces. From certain specimens weighing from ten\r\nto twelve pounds, only six to seven pennyweights could be obtained of\r\nsolid matter, according to Frédol. \"Mr. Telfair saw an enormous medusa\r\nwhich had been abandoned on the beach at Bombay; three days after, the\r\nanimal began to putrefy. To satisfy his curiosity, he got the\r\nneighbouring boatmen to keep an eye upon it, in order to gather the\r\nbones and cartilages belonging to the great creature, if by chance it\r\nhad any; but its decomposition was so rapid and complete that it left no\r\nremains, although it required nine months to dissipate it entirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Floating on the bosom of the waters,\" says Frédol, \"the Medusa\r\nresembles a bell, a pair of breeches, an umbrella, or, better still, a\r\nfloating mushroom, the stool of which has here been separated into lobes\r\nmore or less divergent, sinuous, twisted, shrivelled, fringed, the edges\r\nof the cap being delicately cut, and provided with long thread-like\r\nappendages, which descend vertically into the water like the drooping\r\nbranches of the weeping willow.\"\r\n\r\nThe gelatinous substance of which the body of the Medusa is formed is\r\nsometimes colourless and limpid as crystal; sometimes it is opaline, and\r\noccasionally of a bright blue or pale rose colour. In certain species\r\nthe central parts are of a lively red, blue, or violet colour, while the\r\nrest of the body is of a diaphanous hue. This diaphanous tissue, often\r\ndecked in the finest tints, is so fragile, that when abandoned by the\r\nwave on the beach, it melts and disappears without leaving a trace of\r\nits having existed, so to speak.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these fragile creatures, these living soap-bubbles, make\r\nlong voyages on the surface of the sea. Whilst the sun's rays suffice to\r\ndissipate and even annihilate its vaporous substance on some\r\ninhospitable beach, they abandon themselves without fear during their\r\nentire life to the agitated waves. The whales which haunt round the\r\nHebrides are chiefly nourished by Medusæ which have been transported by\r\nthe waves in innumerable swarms from the coast of the Atlantic to the\r\nregion of whales. \"The locomotion of the Medusæ, which is very slow,\"\r\nsays De Blainville, \"and denotes a very feeble muscular energy, appears,\r\non the other hand, to be unceasing. Since their specific gravity\r\nconsiderably exceeds the water in which they are immerged, these\r\ncreatures, which are so soft that they probably could not repose on\r\nsolid ground, require to agitate constantly in order to sustain\r\nthemselves in the fluid which they inhabit. They require also to\r\nmaintain a continual state of expansion and contraction, of systole and\r\ndiastole. Spallanzani, who observed their movements with great care,\r\nsays that those of translation are executed by the edges of the disk\r\napproaching so near to each other that the diameter is diminished in a\r\nvery sensible degree; by this movement a certain quantity of water\r\ncontained in the body is ejected with more or less force, by which the\r\nbody is projected in the inverse direction. Renovated by the cessation\r\nof force in its first state of development, it contracts itself again,\r\nand makes another step in advance. If the body is perpendicular to the\r\nhorizon, these successive movements of contraction and dilatation cause\r\nit to ascend; if it is more or less oblique, it advances more or less\r\nhorizontally. In order to descend, it is only necessary for the animal\r\nto cease its movements; its specific gravity secures its descent.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, then, by a series of contractions and dilatations of their bodies\r\nthat the Medusæ make their long voyages on the surface of the waters.\r\nThis double movement of their light skeleton had already been remarked\r\nby the ancients, who compared it to the action of respiration in the\r\nhuman chest. From this notion the ancients called them _Sea Lungs_.\r\n\r\nThe Medusæ usually inhabit the deep seas. They are rarely solitary, but\r\nseem to wander about in considerable battalions in the latitudes to\r\nwhich they belong. During their journey they proceed forward, with a\r\ncourse slightly oblique to the convex part of their body. If an obstacle\r\narrests them, if an enemy touches them, the umbrella contracts, and is\r\ndiminished in volume, the tentacles are folded up, and the timid animal\r\ndescends into the depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the Medusæ constitute in the Arctic seas one of the\r\nprincipal supports of the whale. Their innumerable masses sometimes\r\ncover many square leagues in extent. They show themselves and disappear\r\nby turns in the same region, at determinate epochs--alternations which\r\ndepend, no doubt, on the ruling of the winds and currents which carry or\r\nlead them. \"The barks which navigate Lake Thau meet,\" says Frédol, \"at\r\ncertain periods of the year with numerous colonies of a species about\r\nthe size of a small melon, nearly transparent--whitish, like water when\r\nit is mixed with a shade of aniseed. One would be tempted to take these\r\nanimals at first for a collection of floating muslin bonnets.\"\r\n\r\nThe Medusæ are furnished with a mouth placed habitually in the middle of\r\nthe neck. This mouth is rarely unoccupied. Small molluscs, young\r\ncrustaceans, and worms, form their ordinary food. In spite of their\r\nshape, they are most voracious, and snap up their prey all at one\r\nmouthful, without dividing it. If their prey resists and disputes with\r\nit, the Medusa which has seized it holds fast, and remains motionless,\r\nand, without a single movement, waits till fatigue has exhausted and\r\nkilled its victim, when it can swallow it in all security.\r\n\r\nIn respect to size, the Medusæ vary immensely. Some are very small,\r\nwhile others attain more than a yard in diameter. Many species are\r\nphosphorescent during the night.\r\n\r\nMost Medusadæ produce an acute pain when they touch the human body. The\r\npainful sensation produced by this contact is so general in this group\r\nof animals, that it has determined their designation. Until very\r\nrecently all the animals of the group have been, after Cuvier,\r\ndesignated under the name of Acalephæ, or sea nettles, in order to\r\nremind us that the sensation produced is analogous to that occasioned by\r\ncontact with the stinging leaves of the nettle.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dicquemare, who made experiments on himself in this matter,\r\nthe sensation produced is very like that occasioned by a nettle, but it\r\nis more violent, and endures for half an hour. \"In the last moments,\"\r\nsays the abbé, \"the sensation is such as would be produced by reiterated\r\nbut very weak prickings. A considerable pain pervaded all the parts\r\nwhich had been touched, accompanied by pustules of the same colour, with\r\na whitish point.\" \"The sea-bladder,\" says Father Feuillée, \"occasions\r\nme, on touching it, a sudden and severe pain, accompanied with\r\nconvulsions.\"\r\n\r\n\"During the first voyage of the _Princess Louise_ round the world,\" to\r\nquote Frédol, \"Meyen remarked a magnificent physalia, which passed near\r\nthe ship. A young sailor leaped naked into the sea, to seize the animal.\r\nSwimming towards it, he seized it; the creature surrounded the person\r\nof its assailant with its numerous thread-like filaments, which were\r\nnearly a yard in length; the young man, overwhelmed by a feeling of\r\nburning pain, cried out for assistance. He had scarcely strength to\r\nreach the vessel and get aboard again, before the pain and inflammation\r\nwere so violent that brain fever declared itself, and great fears were\r\nentertained for his life.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88. Chrysaora Gaudichaudi.]\r\n\r\nThe organization is much more complicated than early observers were\r\ndisposed to think it. During many ages naturalists were inclined to\r\nimagine, with Réaumur, that the Medusæ were mere masses of organized\r\njelly, of gelatinized water. But when Courtant Dumeril tried the\r\nexperiment of injecting milk into their cavities, and saw the liquid\r\npenetrating into true vessels, he began to comprehend that these very\r\nenigmatical beings were worthy of serious study--the study of subsequent\r\nnaturalists, such as Cuvier, De Blainville, Ehrenberg, Brandt,\r\nMakel-Eschscholtz, Sars, Milne Edwards, Forbes, Gosse, and other modern\r\nnaturalists, who have demonstrated what richness of structure is\r\nconcealed under this gelatiniform and simple structure in the Medusæ; at\r\nthe same time they have revealed to us most mysterious and incredible\r\nfacts as connected with their metamorphoses.\r\n\r\nAmong the Medusæ proper, the most common are Aurelia, Pelagia, and\r\nChrysaora. In the latter, _C. Gaudichaudi_ (Fig. 88), the disk is\r\nhemispherical, festooned with numerous tentacles, attached to a sac-like\r\nstomach, opening by a single orifice in the centre of the peduncle, with\r\nfour long, furbelowed, unfringed arms. Gaudichaudi's chrysaora is found\r\nround the Falkland Islands. The disk forms a regular half-sphere, very\r\nsmooth, and perfectly concave, forming a sort of canopy in the shape of\r\na vault. The circle which surrounds it is divided into sections by means\r\nof vertical lines, regularly divided, of a reddish-brown colour, which\r\nforms an edging to the umbrella-like disk. Twelve broad regular festoons\r\nform this edging. From the summit of these lobes issue twelve bundles of\r\nvery long, simple, capillary tentacles, of a bright red. The peduncle is\r\nbroad and flat, perforated in the middle, to which are attached four\r\nbroad foliaceous arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHIZOSTOMA.\r\n\r\nThe Medusæ which bear the name of _Rhizostoma_ have the disk\r\nhemispherically festooned, depressed, without marginal tentacles,\r\npeduncle divided into four pairs of arms, forked, and dentated almost to\r\ninfinity, each having at their base two toothed auricles. Such is\r\n_Rhizostoma Cuvieri_ of Péron (Fig. 89), the disk of which is of a\r\nbluish-white, like the arms, and of a rich violet over its\r\ncircumference. This beautiful zoophyte is found plentifully in the\r\nAtlantic, living in flocks, which attain a great size. It is common in\r\nthe month of June on the shores of the Saint Onge; in August on the\r\nEnglish coast; and along the strand of every port in the Channel they\r\nare seen in the month of October in thousands, where they lie high and\r\ndry upon the shore, on which they have been thrown by the force of the\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nSuch also is _R. Aldrovandi_ (Fig. 90), which appears all the year round\r\nin calm weather. It is an animal much dreaded by bathers. It possesses\r\nan urticaceous apparatus, which produces an effect similar to the\r\nstinging-nettle when applied to the skin. If the animal touches the\r\nfisherman at the moment of being drawn from the water, it is apt to\r\ninflame the part and raise it into pustules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89. Rhizostoma Cuvieri.]\r\n\r\n_Cassiopea_ and _Cephea_ are two other types belonging to the same\r\ngroup. In _Cassiopea Andromeda_ (Fig. 91), belonging to the first, the\r\ndisk is hemispherical, but much depressed, without marginal tentacles or\r\npeduncle, but with a central disk, with four to eight half-moon-shaped\r\norifices at the side, and throwing off eight to ten branching arms,\r\nfringed with retractile sucking disks. _Cephea Cyclophora_, Péron (Fig.\r\n92), is another very remarkable form of these strangely-constituted\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving presented to the reader certain characteristic types of Medusadæ,\r\nwe proceed to offer some general remark upon the organization and\r\nfunctions of these strange creatures. We have, in short, selected these\r\ntypes because they have been special objects of anatomical and\r\nphysiological study to some of our best naturalists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90. Rhizostoma Aldrovandi.]\r\n\r\nThe Medusæ have no other means of breathing but through the skin. We\r\nremark all over the body of these zoophytes certain cutaneous\r\nelongations, disposed so as to favour the exercise of the breathing\r\nfunction. Certain marginal fringes of extended surface, as well as the\r\ntentacle, are the special seats of the apparatus. The organs of\r\ndigestion also present arrangements peculiar to themselves; the mouth is\r\nplaced on the lower part of the body, and is pierced at the extremity of\r\na trumpet-like tube, hanging sometimes like the tongue of a bell. The\r\nwalls of the stomach, again, are furnished with a multitude of\r\nappendages, which have their origin in the cavity of the organ, and\r\nwhich are very elastic. The stomach, furnished with these vibratile\r\ncells, appears to secrete a juice whose function is to decompose the\r\nfood and render it digestible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91. Cassiopea Andromeda (Tilesius).]\r\n\r\nIn some of the Medusadæ the central mouth is absent altogether. With the\r\nRhizostoma, for instance, the stomachal reservoir has no inferior\r\norifice; it communicates laterally with the canals which descend through\r\nthe thickness of the arms, and open at their extremities through a\r\nmultitude of small mouths. These are the root-like openings from which\r\nthe animals derive their name of Rhizostoma, from the Greek words\r\nῥίζα, root, and στόμα, mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92. Cephea Cyclophora.]\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Rhizostoma are usually eight in number, the free\r\nextremities of each being slightly enlarged: in these arms many small\r\nopenings or mouths occur, which are the entrances to so many ascending\r\ncanals communicating with larger ones, as the veins do in the higher\r\nanimals: the common trunk canal is thus formed, which directs itself to\r\nthe stomach, receiving in its way thither all the lateral branches.\r\n\r\nA very distinct circulation exists in the Medusæ. The peripheric part of\r\nthe stomach suffers the nourishing liquid which has been elaborated in\r\nthe digestive cavity to pass: this fluid then circulates through\r\nnumerous canals, the existence of which have been clearly traced.\r\n\r\nIt is also a singular fact, that organs of sense seem to have been\r\ndiscovered in these Medusæ, which early observers believed to be\r\naltogether destitute of organization. \"During my sojourn on the banks of\r\nthe Red Sea,\" says Ehrenberg, in his work on the _Medusa aurita_,\r\n\"although I had many times examined the brownish bodies upon the edge of\r\nthe disk of the Medusæ, it is only in the month past that I have\r\nrecognized their true nature and function. Each of these bodies consists\r\nof a little yellow button, oval or cylindrical, fixed upon a thin\r\npeduncle. The peduncle is attached to a vesicle, in which the microscope\r\nreveals a glandular body, yellow when the light traverses it, but white\r\nwhen the light is only reflected on it. From this body issue two\r\nbranches, which proceed towards the peduncle or base of the brown body\r\nup to the button or head. I have found that each of these small brown\r\nbodies presents a very distinct red point placed on the dorsal face of\r\nthe yellow head; and when I compare this with my other observations of\r\nsimilar red points in other animals, I find that they greatly resemble\r\nthe eyes of the Rotifera and Entomostraca. The bifurcating body placed\r\nat the base of the brown spot appears to be a nervous ganglion, and its\r\nbranches may be regarded as optic nerves. Each pedunculated eye presents\r\nupon its lower face a small yellow sac, in which are found, in greater\r\nor smaller numbers, small crystalline bodies clear as water.\" The\r\npresence of a red pigment in very fine grains is an argument in favour\r\nof the existence of visual organs in these zoophytes, for the small\r\ncrystals disseminated in the interior of the organ would no doubt\r\nperform the part of refracting light which is produced by crystalline in\r\nthe eyes of vertebrated animals. Moreover, it is found that there are\r\nmarginal corpuscles analogous to these brown spots in other species of\r\nMedusæ. They are of a palish yellow, or quite colourless, and enclose\r\nsometimes a single, sometimes many calcareous corpuscles. When they are\r\ncolourless, some naturalists have rather taken them for ears reduced to\r\ntheir most simple expression.\r\n\r\nThe Medusæ are not absolutely destitute of nervous system. We have seen\r\nthat they have ganglions, and probably optic nerves. Ehrenberg also\r\nstates that they have ganglions at their base, which furnish them with\r\nnervous filaments.\r\n\r\nWithout entering further into the details of their delicate and\r\ncomplicated structure, we shall pause briefly on their mode of\r\nreproduction. We shall find here physiological phenomena so remarkable\r\nas to appear incredible, had not the researches of modern naturalists\r\nplaced the facts beyond all doubt. \"Which of us,\" says M. de\r\nQuatrefages, \"would not proclaim the prodigy, if he saw a reptile issue\r\nfrom an egg laid in his court-yard, which afterwards gave birth to an\r\nindefinite number of fishes and birds? Well, the generation of the\r\nMedusæ is at least as marvellous as the fact which we have imagined.\"\r\nLet us note, for example, what takes place with the Rose Aurelia, a\r\nbeautiful Medusa, of a pale rose colour, with nearly hemispherical disk,\r\nfrom four to five inches in diameter, whose edge is furnished with short\r\nrusset-brown tentacles; taking for our guide the eloquent and learned\r\nauthor of the \"Metamorphosis in Men and Animals,\" M. de Quatrefages.\r\n\r\nThe Medusa, designated under the name of Rose Aurelia, lays eggs which\r\nare characterised by the existence of three concentric spheres. These\r\neggs are transformed into oval larvæ, covered with vibratile cells,\r\nhaving a slight depression in front. They swim about for a short time\r\nwith great activity, much like the infusoria, which they strikingly\r\nresemble in other respects.\r\n\r\nAt the end of forty-eight hours the movements decrease. Aided by the\r\ndepression already noted, the larvæ attaches itself to some solid body,\r\nfixing itself to it at this point by the assistance of a thick mucous\r\nmatter. A change of form soon takes place: it becomes elongated; its\r\npedicle is contracted, and its free extremity swells into a club-like\r\nshape. An opening soon presents itself in the centre of this extremity,\r\nthrough which an internal cavity appears. Four little mammals have now\r\nappeared on the edge, which are elongated in the manner of arms. Others\r\nsoon follow: these are the tentacles of a polyp: the young infusoria has\r\nbecome a polyp!\r\n\r\nThe polyp increases by buds and shoots, just like a strawberry plant,\r\nwhich throws out its slender stems in all directions, covering all the\r\nneighbouring ground.\r\n\r\nThe young Medusa lives some time under this form. Then one of the polyps\r\nbecomes enlarged and its form cylindrical. This cylinder is divided into\r\nfrom ten to fourteen superposed rings. These rings, at first smooth,\r\nform themselves into festoons, and separate into bifurcated thongs; the\r\nintermediate lines become channeled. The animal now resembles a pile of\r\nplates, cut round the edges. In a short time each ring is stirred at the\r\nfree edge of its fringe: this becomes contractile. The rings are\r\nindividualised. Finally, these annular creatures, obscure in their\r\nlives, isolate themselves. When detached, they begin to swim: from that\r\ntime they have only to perfect and modify their form. From being flat,\r\nthey become concave on the one side and convex on the other. The\r\ndigestive cavity--the gastro-vascular canals--become more decided; the\r\nmouth opens, the tentacles are elongated, the floating marginal cirri\r\nbecome more and more numerous; and now, after all these metamorphoses,\r\nthe Medusa appears: it perfectly resembles the mother.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBULARIDÆ.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that recent researches have led to a separation of\r\na class of animals from the Sertularia, and to their being united with\r\nthe Medusæ. Of these creatures we formerly only knew one of the forms,\r\nnamely, the polyp form; or, rather, the first stage of it. During their\r\nearliest days they possess a polyp, furnished with tentacles, and a\r\nbell-shaped body. During their medusoid age, they present a central\r\nstomach, with four canals in the form of a cross, and four to eight\r\ntentacles with cirri. The animals constitute the Tubularidæ,\r\ncomprehending many genera; among others the Tubularia and Campanularia,\r\nin studying which Van Beneden of Louvain discovered most interesting\r\nfacts connected with the subject of alternate generation.\r\n\r\nThe class of zoophytes ranged among the Tubularia have the power of\r\nsecreting an inverting tube of a horny nature, in which the fleshy body\r\ncan move up and down, expanding its tentacles over the top. Others of\r\nthem give forth buds, each of which takes the form of a polyp, and\r\nthese, being permanent, give it a shrub-like or branched appearance; it\r\nis now a compound polyp. The tube is branched, and the orifices from\r\nwhich the polyps expand usually dilate into cups or cells. This is the\r\ncondition of the _Tubulari-campanulariadæ_ groups, which are numerous\r\nround our own coast and in the Channel. The Tubularia are plant-like and\r\nhorny, rooted by fibres, tubular, and filled with a semi-fluid organic\r\npulp; polyps naked and fleshy, protruding from the extremity of every\r\nbranchlet of the tube, and armed with one or two circles of smooth\r\nfiliform tentacles; bulbules soft and naked, germinating from the base\r\nof the tentacles; embryo medusiform. \"Some modern authors,\" says Frédol,\r\n\"assure us that the tree-like form of these polyps is a degraded and\r\ntransitory form of the Medusæ. The Medusa originates the polyp, the\r\npolyp becomes a Medusa.\" _Tubularia ramea_ so perfectly resembles an old\r\ntree in miniature, deprived of its leaves, that it is difficult to\r\nbelieve it is not of a vegetable origin; it is now a vigorous tree in\r\nminiature, in full flower, rising from the summit of a brown-spotted\r\nstem, with many branches and tufted shoots, terminating in so many\r\nhydras of a beautiful yellow or brilliant red. _T. ramosa_, of a\r\nbrownish colour and horny substance, rising six inches, is rooted by\r\ntortuous, wrinkled fibres, with flexible, smooth, and thread-like\r\nshoots, branching into a doubly permeate form. In _T. indivisa_ the\r\ntubes are clustering; its numerous stems are horny, yellow, and from six\r\nto twelve inches in height, about a line in diameter, and marked with\r\nunequal knots from space to space, like the stalk of the oat-straw with\r\nthe joints cut off. Their lower extremity is tortuous, attaching itself\r\nreadily to shells and stones in deep water, flourishing in deep muddy\r\nbottoms, and upright as a flower, fixed by the tapering root-like\r\nterminations of its horny tube: a flowering animal, having, however,\r\nneither flower nor branch. At the summit of each stem, a double scarlet\r\ncorolla is developed of from five to thirty-five petals, in rows, the\r\nexternal one spreading, those in the interior rising in a tuft; a little\r\nbelow, the ovarium appears, drooping when ripe like a bunch of\r\norange-coloured grapes. After a time the petals of the corolla fade,\r\nfall, and die, and a bud replaces them, which produces a new polyp; and\r\nso on. This succession determines the length of the stem. Each apparent\r\nflower throws out a small tube, which terminates it, and each addition\r\nadds one joint more to the axis, which it increases in length.\r\n\r\nThe Campanulariæ differ considerably from the above, the ends of their\r\nbranches, whence the polyps issue, being enlarged into a bell-like\r\nshape, whence their name. _C. dichotoma_ is at once the most delicate\r\nand most elegant of the species. It presents a brownish stem, thin as a\r\nthread of silk, but strong and elastic. The polyps are numerous: upon a\r\ntree eight or nine inches high there may be as many hundreds. _C.\r\nvolubilis_ is a minute microscopic species, living parasitically on\r\ncorallines, seaweed, and shelled animals. The stem is a capillary\r\ncorneous tube, which creeps and twists itself upon its support, throwing\r\nout at alternate intervals a long slender stalk, twisted throughout or\r\nonly partially, which supports a bell-shaped cup of perfect\r\ntransparency, and prettily serrated round the brim. Dr. Johnston found\r\nthe antennæ of a crab so profusely infested with them as to resemble\r\nhairy brushes. It is furnished, according to Hassall, with a delicate\r\njoint or hinge at the base of each little cup--a contrivance designed,\r\nit is imagined, to enable the frail zoophyte the better to elude the\r\nrude contact of the element in which it lives, by allowing it to bend to\r\na force which it cannot resist.\r\n\r\nThe Campanulariæ increase by budding, the buds being found in much the\r\nsame manner as in the Hydræ. It is a simple excrescence, which, in due\r\ntime, takes the form of the branch from which it proceeds. These buds\r\nhave their birth at certain distances, and form a new polyp.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIPHONOPHORA.\r\n\r\nAlongside the Medusæ naturalists place certain marine zoophytes which\r\nare equally remarkable for their beauty and for their curious structure,\r\nthe latter being so complicated that their true organization long\r\nremained unknown. They were known, until very recently, under the\r\ndesignation of Hydrostatic Acalephæ, or Hydra-medusæ. They are known in\r\nour days as Siphonophoræ. These inhabitants of the deep are graceful in\r\nform, and are distinguished by their delicate tissues and brilliant\r\ncolours. Essentially swimmers, supported by one or many vessels filled\r\nwith air--true swimming-bladders, more or less numerous, and of variable\r\nform--they float upon the waves, remaining always on the surface,\r\nwhatever may be the state of the sea. They are natural skiffs, and quite\r\nincapable of immersion. The Siphonophoræ form four orders or families;\r\nnamely, the _Diphydæ_, double-bell-shaped animals, one fitting into the\r\ncavity of the other; _Physaliadæ_, having large oblong air-vessels and\r\nnumerous tentacles of several forms, long, and pendent from one end of\r\nthe shell, with a wrinkled crest; _Vilelladæ_, animals stretching over a\r\ncartilaginous plate with a flat body, an oblique, vertical,\r\ncartilaginous crest above, a tubular mouth below, and surrounded by\r\nnumerous short tentacles; _Physophora_, consisting of a slender and\r\nvertical axis, terminating in an air-bladder, carrying laterally\r\nswimming-bladders, which lose themselves amongst a bundle of slender\r\nwhite filaments.\r\n\r\n\r\nVILELLADÆ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93. Vilella limbosa (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe Vilellæ assemble together in great shoals; in tropical seas and even\r\nin the Mediterranean they may be seen in fine weather floating on the\r\nsurface of the waves. As described by De Blainville, the body is oval or\r\ncircular, and gelatinous, sustained in the interior of the dorsal disk\r\nby a solid sub-cartilaginous frame, provided on the lower surface of the\r\ndisk with extensible tentacular cirri. The family includes four genera;\r\nnamely, _Vilella_, the Holothuria of the Chinese, which the reader will\r\nmost readily comprehend from the brief description we shall give of the\r\nMediterranean Vilella (_V. limbosa_--Fig. 93), which has been very\r\nminutely examined by M. Charles Vogt, of Geneva, from whose work on the\r\n\"Inferior Animals of the Mediterranean\" our details are borrowed. _V.\r\nspirans_, sometimes called _V. limbosa_, was discovered in the\r\nMediterranean, between Monaco and Mentone, by Forskahl, who most\r\nerroneously took it for a holothuria. On the upper surface of the animal\r\nis a hydrostatic apparatus, the object of which is to maintain its\r\nequilibrium in the ambient element. This apparatus consists of a shield\r\nand a crest, organs of which M. Vogt gives a very detailed description;\r\nbut it is on the under surface that the principal organs of the Vilella\r\nare exhibited. These are not seen when the animal swims, because under\r\nsuch circumstances the vertical, oblique crest only is visible. The\r\nlower surface is concave, with a sort of mesial nucleus, presenting at\r\nthe extremity of a trumpet-like prolongation, whitish and contractile, a\r\nsort of central mouth, surrounded by tentacular cirri, the external row\r\nbeing much longer than the internal ones. This was formerly thought to\r\nbe the stomach of the Vilella. In the present day, this appendage is\r\nknown to be the central polyp around which are grouped other whitish and\r\nmuch smaller appendages, the base being surrounded by little yellow\r\nbunches. These are supposed to be the reproductive organs. Between the\r\ncrest and the shield numerous free tentacles present themselves,\r\nvermiform in appearance, cylindrical, and of a sky-blue colour, which\r\nare kept in continual motion.\r\n\r\nThe Vilella is therefore not an isolated individual, but a group or\r\ncolony, in which the individuals intended to be reproductive are the\r\nmost numerous, and occupy the inferior parts.\r\n\r\nThe central polyp, by its size and structure, is distinguishable at the\r\nfirst glance from all the other appendages of the lower surface of the\r\nbody. It is a cylindrical tube, very contractile and pear-shaped,\r\nswollen into a round ball, or considerably elongated. Its mouth is round\r\nand much dilated; it opens in the cylindrical or trumpet part, which is\r\ncontained in a sac in the form of elongated fusci, clothed in the\r\nwhitish integuments which formed the body of the polyp when perfect. At\r\nthe bottom of the sac two rows of openings are observed, which lead to a\r\nvascular network extending over the whole body; the membranous parts,\r\nwhile affecting various conditions in their arrangement, are\r\nnevertheless in direct communication with all the reproductive\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nIt is a general characteristic of all colonies of polypi that the\r\ndigestive cavities of the individuals composing them meet and inosculate\r\nin a common vascular system. The Vilellæ present the same conformation.\r\nOnly in their case the vascular system is extended horizontally, this\r\nbeing the essential character of the union of all the individuals\r\nconstituting the colony, with the canals common to all, in which the\r\nnourishing fluids circulate, elaborated for all and by all. It is a true\r\npicture of social communism realized by Nature.\r\n\r\nThe central polyp is alone destined to absorb the food. M. Vogt has\r\nalways found in its interior cavity fragments of the shells of\r\ncrustaceans, the remains of small fishes; and he has often seen the hard\r\nparts which resist digestion discharged through the trumpet-like\r\nopening. This central polyp nourishes itself and also all the others,\r\nbut is itself sterile.\r\n\r\nThe tentacles are hollow cylinders, completely closed at the extremity.\r\nThese are strong muscular tubes of considerable thickness, the interior\r\nof which is filled with a transparent liquid. They are enveloped in a\r\nstrong membrane of a deep-blue colour. The epidermis is furnished with\r\nsmall stinging capsules, formed of a sac with comparatively thick walls.\r\nIf this sac is compressed under the microscope it explodes, opening at a\r\ndeterminate part, and throwing out an apparatus forming a long stiff\r\nfilament, which is implanted on a conical channel and surrounded with\r\npoints. \"I know not,\" says M. Vogt, \"if all this machinery can re-enter\r\nthe capsule after it has exploded; but I presume that the animal can\r\nextend itself and withdraw at pleasure. A tentacle of Vilella\r\nsufficiently compressed presents a surface bristling with these cirri,\r\nso as to resemble a brush. The tentacles themselves are in continual\r\nmotion, and I have no reason to doubt that the observation of Lesson,\r\nwho saw them cover small crustaceans and fishes, may be perfectly true.\r\nThese stinging organs doubtless serve the same purpose as with other\r\nanimals of the same class; namely, to kill the prey which the tentacles\r\nhave enabled them to secure.\" Thus the Vilellæ have their javelins, as\r\nthe Greek and Roman warriors had, and a lasso, as the cavaliers of\r\nMexico and Texas have.\r\n\r\nThe reproducing individuals form the great mass of the appendages\r\nattached to the under surface of the Vilella. The form of the\r\nindividuals is much more varied, inasmuch as they are extremely\r\ncontractile. Nevertheless, they have considerable resemblance to the\r\ncorolla of a hyacinth.\r\n\r\nThese reproductive individuals are, then, at the same time nurses. The\r\nMedusæ originating by budding in the case of those reproductive\r\nindividuals, constitute the sexual state of the Vilellæ. They exist, in\r\nshort, in two alternate states: the one sexual, producing eggs; in this\r\nstate they are isolated individuals of the Medusadæ, which never group\r\nthemselves or form colonies: the other aggregate state is non-sexual,\r\nand in it they form swimming colonies, under the special designation of\r\n_Vilellæ_.\r\n\r\nThe Vilellæ, so called by Lamarck, are found widely diffused in the seas\r\nof Europe, Asia, America, and Australia. One species, _V. limbosa_, is\r\noften taken on the southern coast of England. The animals are also met\r\nwith far at sea, and often huddled together in considerable masses, old\r\nand young together.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief account of the strange facts to which the careful study\r\nof the lower class of marine animals initiates us. Naturalists range\r\nalong with them the _Rataria_ and _Porpita_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rataria have the body oval or circular, sustained by a compressed\r\nsub-cartilaginous framework, much elevated, having a muscular, movable,\r\nlongitudinal crest below, and provided in the middle with a free\r\nproboscidiform stomach and a single row of marginal tentacular suckers.\r\nDe Blainville was inclined to consider the very small animals which\r\nEschscholtz termed Ratariæ as young and undeveloped _Vilellæ_. M. Vogt\r\ndoubts not that the Ratariæ are young Vilellæ which have acquired, by\r\nlittle and little, the elliptical form, but that the limb is only\r\nfurnished at a later period to the reproductive individuals. These\r\nRatariæ are engendered, according to Vogt, by the naked-eyed Medusæ born\r\nof the Vilellæ, and owe their existence to the eggs produced by these\r\nMedusæ.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Porpitæ constitute, like the Vilellæ, colonies of floating animals\r\nfurnished with a cartilaginous, horizontal, and rounded skeleton, but\r\nthey are destitute of crest or veil. The body is circular and depressed,\r\nslightly convex above, with an internal circular cartilaginous support,\r\nhaving the surface marked by concentric striæ crossing other radiating\r\nstriæ, the upper surface being covered by a delicate membrane only. The\r\nbody is concave below; the under surface is furnished with a great\r\nnumber of tentacles, the exterior ones being longest, and also with\r\nsmall cilia, each terminating in a globule, which sometimes contains\r\nair; the interior tentacles are shorter, simple, and fleshy. In the\r\ncentre of these tentacula is the mouth, in form of a small proboscis,\r\nleading to a simple stomach surrounded by a somewhat glandular\r\nsubstance. The editors of the last edition of the \"Règne Animal\" only\r\nmention one species--_P. Gigantea_, a native of the Mediterranean and\r\nother warm seas, of a beautiful blue colour. Lamarck gives four species.\r\nDe Blainville and others consider with Cuvier that they are only\r\nvarieties, which Eschscholtz reunites under one species. In Fig. 94 we\r\nhave represented _P. Pacifica_ (Lesson), the disk of which is twelve\r\nlines in diameter, without comprehending the tentacles. This disk is\r\nfinely radiated on the under surface with a brilliant argentine nacre.\r\nThe membranous fold which surrounds it is cut into, leaving light and\r\nperfectly straight festoons. It is of a clear celestial blue colour, and\r\nvery transparent. The tentacles are much compressed, very thin and\r\ncylindrical, of a light blue, and the glands are of an indigo blue\r\ncolour. All the reproductive individuals, which are placed in the lower\r\npart of the body, are of a perfect hyaline white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94. Porpita pacifica (Lesson).]\r\n\r\nThis beautiful Porpita was discovered by Lesson on the Peruvian coast,\r\nwhere it occurs in swarms closely packed on the surface of the sea. \"Its\r\nmanner of life,\" says Lesson, \"is perfectly analogous to that of the\r\nVilella. Their locomotion on the sea is purely passive, at least in\r\nappearance. Their disk laid flat on the surface upon the water-line,\r\nleaves them to float freely and in a horizontal direction, the irritable\r\narms hanging all round them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSOPHORA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95. Physophora hydrostatica (Forskahl).]\r\n\r\nThis family includes the _Physophora_, properly so called, the\r\n_Agalina_, and the _Stephanomina_, for the history of which we are\r\nindebted to the curious observations of M. Vogt. Fig. 95 is a\r\nrepresentation of _Physophora hydrostatica_, after M. Vogt's memoir. We\r\nsee that the animal is composed of a slender vertical axis, terminating\r\nin an aërial bladder, carrying laterally certain vesicles, known as\r\nswimming-balls, which terminate in a bundle of whitish slender threads.\r\n\r\nThe aërial bladder is brilliant and silvery, punctured with red spots.\r\nThe swimming-bladders are encased in a transparent and somewhat\r\ncartilaginous capsule, which is continued into the common median trunk,\r\nthe latter being rose-coloured, hollow, and very contractile; in short,\r\nit presents very delicate muscular fibres, which expand themselves on\r\nthe external fan of the capsule, and is closed on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe swimming-bladders are of a glass-like transparency, and of a firm,\r\ncompact tissue. They are attached obliquely and alternately upon a\r\ncommon axis, presenting an exterior curvature, a round opening,\r\nfurnished with a fine, muscular, and very contractile limb, and arranged\r\nlike the iris of the eye. Their power of resistance is increased by\r\ncertain horny hollow threads, which are in direct communication with the\r\ncavity of the vertical trunk, and have their origin in a common circular\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\n\"The animal,\" says Vogt, \"is enabled to guide itself in any direction by\r\nmeans of the swimming apparatus or air-bags. These, on opening, are\r\nfilled with water, which is again ejected in the contractile movement,\r\nfor their movements may be compared to that of the umbrella of the\r\nMedusæ. It is the violent expulsion of this liquid which enables the\r\nanimal to advance diagonally through the water, a kind of motion which\r\nis the consequence of its organization; for where both rows of air-bags\r\nare working in the direction of the axis of the trunk, the organism will\r\nincline to the side which works most, but always in such a manner that\r\nthe aërial vesicle will be borne forward.\"\r\n\r\nIn its lower parts the trunk expands, becomes flat, and winds itself in\r\na spiral. It is hollow, and encloses a transparent viscous liquid, in\r\nwhich very small granules are observed, which appear to be the result of\r\ndigestion. This disk is attached to three different sorts of appendages;\r\nwe shall first address ourselves to the tentacles.\r\n\r\nThese form a crown or bundle of vermiform appendages, of a reddish\r\ncolour, over an inch in length, and which are kept continually in\r\nmotion: these are formed of a glass-like cartilaginous substance; they\r\nare conical tubes, closed on all parts except at the point where the\r\ntentacle is attached to the disk. Their cavity is filled with the\r\ngranulous liquid already mentioned. On the under surface of the disk,\r\nand to the inside of these tentacles, the polyps and fishing-lines are\r\nattached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96. P. hydrostatica, with a portion of the disk,\r\nthree polyps, and reproductive clusters attached.]\r\n\r\nThe anterior part of the polyp is formed of a glass-like substance,\r\nwhich changes its form in the most varied and surprising manner. It\r\nbears a roundish mouth at its summit. In its posterior part the polyp\r\npresents a straight hollow stem, of reddish colour; but near to this red\r\nstem we find a thick tuft of cylindrical appendages, from the middle of\r\nwhich springs the extensible and contractile filaments which Vogt calls\r\nthe _fishing-lines_ (fil pêcheur), and of which he has given the\r\nfollowing very strange account:\r\n\r\n\"Each of these appendages consists of an assemblage of cylindrical tubes\r\nsomewhat resembling and analogous to a filament of confervæ. All these\r\ntubes are traversed by a continuous canal, which originates in the\r\ninternal cavity of the stem of the polyp. Each fragment of the line is\r\ncapable of a prodigious extent of elongation and contraction; but where\r\ncompletely drawn back the pieces fold themselves up somewhat in the\r\nmanner of a pocket foot-rule. It is to the combined effect of\r\ncontraction and the unfolding of the pieces that these lines owe the\r\nmarvellous changes of length which they present.\" In Fig. 96 are\r\nrepresented the polyps and fishing-lines of _P. hydrostatica_, with a\r\nportion of the disk and two pairs of reproductive clusters.\r\n\r\nIn this figure it will be observed that each fragment or joint has\r\nimplanted, near the articulation, a secondary line, which bears the\r\nstinging organ. Each of these filaments consists of three parts: a\r\nstraight stem, muscular, contractile, and hollow, the cavity of which\r\ncommunicates with that of the trunk which carries it; a middle part, a\r\nsort of tube containing, in a considerable internal cavity, a\r\ntransparent liquid; finally, an inflated stinging organ, which\r\nterminates the apparatus. This last is egg-shaped, and consists\r\ninternally of a hyaline substance of cartilaginous consistence, in the\r\ninterior of which we find a great cavity, which opens from within, near\r\nthe base of the capsule; to the inside of this cavity a second muscular\r\nsac is attached all round the opening of the capsule, in such a manner\r\nthat the opening leads directly into the cavity of the sac. This cavity\r\nconceals in its interior a long filament usually rolled up in a spiral,\r\nas illustrated in Fig. 97, where the two urticant capsules of the\r\nstinging apparatus of _Physophora hydrostatica_ are represented, one of\r\nthem being a section, magnified by twelve diameters. This spirally\r\nrolled-up filament consists of a large quantity of very small, hard,\r\nsabre-shaped, corpuscular bodies, supported the one against the other,\r\nand having their points turned inwards. These objects Vogt terms\r\n\"_urticant sabres_:\" the extremity of the filament consists of curved\r\ncorpuscles, larger, of a brownish yellow, very strong, and with a double\r\npoint. M. Vogt had also opportunities of observing the action of these\r\nstinging capsules. He has seen them burst naturally, and he has also\r\nobtained artificially the same result. In the former case the filament\r\nissues from the opening left at the base of the capsule with a sort of\r\nexplosion. \"The use,\" he says, \"of the fishing-lines\" becomes evident\r\nwhen we see a Physophora in repose in a vase large enough for its full\r\ndevelopment; then it takes a vertical position; the lines elongate\r\nthemselves more and more, by unfolding one by one the secondary lines\r\nwith stinging capsules, and the Physophora now resembles a flower posed\r\nupon a tuft of roots, with extremely long and delicate rootlets\r\nreaching the bottom of the vase. But in the case of the Physophora the\r\nliving roots are in continual motion. Each line is elongated,\r\nforeshortened, and contracted in a thousand ways. The least movement of\r\nthe water causes the stinging capsules to be suddenly drawn up, the\r\nlines hauled in most rapidly being those near the crown of tentacles.\r\nThis continuous play of the lines has no other object than to attract\r\nthe prey destined to feed the polyp, and we cannot find any better\r\ncomparison for them than the fishing-lines to which they have been\r\ncompared. The moment that some small microscopic medusæ, larvæ, or\r\ncrustaceans come within the sphere of those redoubted lines, it is at\r\nonce surrounded, seized, and led with irresistible force towards the\r\nmouth of this polyp by a gentle and gradual contraction of the line; the\r\nstinging organs, complicated as we have seen them to be in the\r\nPhysophora, thus serve the same purpose as the stinging organs\r\ndisposed on the arms of the Hydræ, or on the external surface of the\r\ntentacles and prolific polyps of the Vilellæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97. Offensive apparatus of Physophora hydrostatica.]\r\n\r\nCan there be any animal form more graceful than _Agalma rubra_, which is\r\nreproduced in Plate VII. from Vogt's Memoir? This beautiful creature is\r\ncommon in the Mediterranean, on the coast near Nice, from November till\r\nthe month of May. Towards the middle of December Vogt found nearly fifty\r\nindividuals in the space of an hour, opposite to the Port of Nice, all\r\nfollowing the same current, a prodigious quantity of Salpæ, Medusæ, and\r\nsmall Pteropodean Mollusks accompanying them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VII.--Agalma rubra, three-fifths natural size.]\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing more graceful,\" says Vogt, \"than this Agalma as it\r\nfloats along near the surface of the waters, its long, transparent,\r\ngarland-like lines extended, and their limits distinctly indicated by\r\nbundles of a brilliant vermilion red, while the rest of the body is\r\nconcealed by its very transparency; the entire organism always swims in\r\na slightly oblique position near the surface, but is capable of steering\r\nitself in any direction with great rapidity. I have had in my possession\r\nsome of these garlands more than three feet in length, in which the\r\nseries of air-bags measured more than four inches, so that in the great\r\nvase in which I kept them the column of swimming bags touched the\r\nbottom, while the aërial vesicle floated on the surface. Immediately\r\nafter its capture the columns contracted themselves to such a point that\r\nthey were scarcely perceptible, but when left to repose in a spacious\r\nvase, all its shrunken appendages deployed themselves round the vase in\r\nthe most graceful manner imaginable, the column of swimming-bladders\r\nremaining immovable in their vertical position, the air-bags at the\r\nsurface, while the different appendages soon began to play. The polyps,\r\nplanted at intervals along the common trunk of rose-colour, began to\r\nagitate themselves in all directions, taking a thousand odd forms; the\r\nreproductive individuals, like the tentacles, were contracting and\r\ntwisting themselves about like so many worms; the tentacles were\r\nstirred, the ovarian clusters began to dilate and contract, the\r\nspermatic air-bells agitated the waters with their umbrellas, like the\r\nMedusæ; but what most excited my curiosity, was the continuous action of\r\nthe fishing-lines, which continued to unroll and contract in a most\r\nsurprising manner, retiring altogether sometimes with the utmost\r\nprecipitation. All who have witnessed these living colonies detach\r\nthemselves reluctantly from the strange spectacle, where each polyp\r\nseems to play the part of the fisherman who throws his line, furnished\r\nwith baited hooks, withdrawing it when he feels a nibble, and throwing\r\nagain when he discovers his disappointment. These efforts continue in\r\nfull vigour for two or three days, and I have succeeded sometimes in\r\nfeeding them with the small crustaceans which swarm on our coasts.\"\r\n\r\nOf the \"personelle\" of these colonies a few words will not be misplaced.\r\nThe common axis of the _Agalma_ is a hollow muscular tube, the length of\r\nwhich may be three feet, and its breadth an eighth or tenth of an inch;\r\nit is traversed by a double current of granulous liquid; at its summit\r\nis the aërial vesicle; beneath are the swimming vessels. These are\r\ndisposed along the trunk in a double series, attaining sometimes the\r\nnumber of sixty; their structure is analogous to the same organs in the\r\nPhysophora.\r\n\r\nIn examining the posterior portion of the trunk, traversing polyps are\r\nobserved at intervals, whose base is surrounded by a cluster of reddish\r\ngrains, each of which is armed with a _line_, and with its surrounding\r\nfilament, terminating in a tendril of a red vermilion colour, which is a\r\nperfect arsenal of offensive and defensive arms. There we find\r\n\"_sabres_\" of divers sizes, and poniards of various forms, the whole\r\nconstituting a truly formidable stinging apparatus.\r\n\r\nThese warlike engines, these arms of attack and defence with which man\r\nsurrounds himself, Nature has freely bestowed on these little creatures\r\nwith which the ocean swarms in some places. It might be said that, after\r\nhaving created these graceful creatures to ornament and decorate the\r\ndepths of the ocean, the Creator was so pleased with His work that He\r\nfurnished them with arms for their protection and defence against all\r\nattacks from without.\r\n\r\nAmong these creatures we may note the pretty _Apolemia contorta_ of\r\nMilne Edwards (Fig. 98), which also inhabits the Mediterranean, and\r\nparticularly the coast of Nice, and is no less admirable in its\r\nstructure than _Agalma rubra_. This elegant species is often met with in\r\nthe Gulf of Villafranca, near Nice, and has been figured and described\r\nby Milne Edwards, Charles Vogt, and also by M. de Quatrefages, who asks\r\nthe reader \"to figure to himself an axis of flexible crystals, sometimes\r\nmore than a mètre (forty inches), all round which are attached, by means\r\nof long peduncles or foot-stalks equally transparent, some hundreds of\r\nbodies, sometimes elongated, sometimes flat, and formed like the bud of\r\na flower. If we add to this garland of pearls of a vivid red colour, an\r\ninfinity of fine filaments, varying in thickness, and give life and\r\nmotion to all these parts, we have even now only a very slight and\r\nimperfect idea of the marvellous organism.\" The air-bells in _Apolemia\r\ncontorta_ consist of a mass having the form of an elongated egg cut in\r\nthe middle. They are arranged in a vertical series of twelves, and the\r\naxis which supports them is terminated by the aërial vesicle. This axis\r\nis always arranged in a spiral form, even in its greatest expansion, is\r\nof a fine rose tint, and flattened into the form of a ribbon; it is\r\nmarked in all its length with asperitics or hollow dimples, in which the\r\nfilamental appendages originate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98. Apolemia contorta, one-third natural size (Milne\r\nEdwards).]\r\n\r\nThe nursing polyps have been called _poboscidiferous_ organs by Mr.\r\nMilne Edwards, who has studied them carefully. They are rendered\r\nconspicuous at a glance by the bright-red colour of their digestive\r\ncavity and their extreme dilatability. At the base of their stems the\r\nvery delicate filaments called fishing-lines are attached, which are\r\nfurnished with a multitude of stinging tendrils of a reddish colour.\r\nThese tendrils slightly resemble those of the Agalmæ, and the sabre-like\r\nweapons are not wanting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99. Apolemia contorta, magnified 12 times.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100. Apolemia contorta, reproductive pair, magnified\r\n12 times.]\r\n\r\nBetween the nursing polyps are placed in pairs the reproductive\r\nindividuals, having the form of an elongated tube very dilatable, and\r\nclosed at the free end. They have, then, no mouth! Milne Edwards calls\r\nthese \"vesicular appendages,\" and M. Koelliker, tentacles. The buds\r\narranged at the base of each prolific individual vary; but, according to\r\nM. Vogt, they are always there in pairs--a male and female at the base\r\nof each stem. Figs. 99 and 100 represent the colony we have endeavoured\r\nto describe, 99 being the nursing individual of _Apolemia contorta_\r\nmagnified twelve times, 100 representing the reproductive pair under the\r\nsame magnifying power.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIPHYDÆ.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the _Physophora_, the _Agalma_, and the _Apolemia_\r\nhave for the use of the colony a vast number of swimming vesicles and a\r\nterminal aërial vesicle. It is much the same in the _Prayæ_ or Diphydæ.\r\nIn this family a great number of natatory vesicles are connected with\r\nthe terminal aërial vesicle, as in Fig. 101, _Praya diphys_. This\r\nspecies is widely diffused in the sea which bathes the Nicean coast, but\r\nit is very difficult to procure perfect specimens. M. Vogt found\r\nfragments more than three feet long which swam on the surface, and was\r\nin its state of contraction not more than a finger's length. This\r\nspecies has been met with at Porta della Praya and at San Yago, one of\r\nthe Cape de Verde islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101. Praya diphys (Blainville).]\r\n\r\nThe colony of the Praya presents two great locomotive bell shaped\r\nmasses, between which the common trunk is suspended, and to which it can\r\nretire. This cylindrical trunk, which is thin and transparent, carries\r\nfrom space to space certain groups very exactly circumscribed and\r\nindividualised. Each of these groups consists of a nursing polyp, having\r\nits fishing-line with a special floating air-bladder, a reproductive bud\r\nmale or female, and a protecting casque enveloping the whole.\r\n\r\nAnother species having a great resemblance to the _Praya_ is _Galeolaria\r\naurantiaca_ (Plate VIII.), or orange Galeolaria, which is represented on\r\nthe opposite page, borrowed from the fine \"Memoir of the Inferior\r\nAnimals of the Mediterranean,\" by Carl Vogt. Here we find only two great\r\nfloating bladders placed at each extremity of a common trunk, and\r\nserving the purpose of a locomotive apparatus to the whole colony. This\r\ntrunk carries in like manner polyps placed at regular intervals forming\r\nisolated groups, provided each with its protecting plates. But there is\r\nno special swimming apparatus for each of these groups. Moreover, each\r\ncolony is either male or female.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSALIA.\r\n\r\nLet us finally note among the Siphonophoræ a zoophyte which has\r\nattracted great attention, and has been described under many names.\r\nSailors call it the sea-bladder, from its resemblance to that organ; it\r\nis also known as the Portuguese man-of-war, from its fancied resemblance\r\nto a small ship as it floats along under its tiny sail. Naturalists\r\nafter Eschscholtz call it _Physalia utriculus_, from the Greek word\r\nφυσαλὶϛ, a bubble, and utriculus from its stinging powers. It was\r\nlong thought that the Physalia was an isolated individual. But,\r\naccording to recent researches, they form, like the species already\r\ndescribed, an animal republic.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine a great cylindrical bladder dilated in the middle,\r\nattenuated and rounded at its two extremities, of eleven or twelve\r\ninches in length, and from one to three broad. Its appearance is glassy\r\nand transparent, its colour an imperfect purple, passing to a violet,\r\nthen to an azure above. It is surmounted by a crest, limpid and pure as\r\ncrystal, veined with purple and violet in decreasing tints. Under the\r\nvesicle float the fleshy filaments, waving and contorted into a spiral\r\nform, which sometimes descend perpendicularly like so many threads of\r\ncelestial blue. Sailors believe that the crest which surmounts the\r\nvesicle performs the office of a sail, and that they tell the navigator\r\n\"how the wind blows,\" as they say. With all respect to the sailors, the\r\nbladder-like form, with its aërial crest, is only a hydrostatic\r\napparatus, whose office is to lighten the animal, and modify its\r\nspecific gravity. Mr. Gosse thinks otherwise, however.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VIII.--Galeolaria aurantiaca. (Vogt.)]\r\n\r\n\"This bladder,\" says Gosse, in his \"Year by the Sea-side,\" \"is filled\r\nwith air, and therefore floats almost wholly on the surface. Along the\r\nupper side, nearly from end to end, runs a thin edge of membrane, which\r\nis capable of being erected at will to a considerable height, fully\r\nequal at times to the entire width of the bladder, when it represents an\r\narched fore-and-aft sail, the bladder being the hull. From the bottom of\r\nthe bladder, near the thickest extremity, where there is a denser\r\nportion of the membrane, depends a crowded mass of organs, most of which\r\ntake the form of very slender, highly contractile movable threads, which\r\nhang down into the deep to a depth of many feet, or occasionally of\r\nseveral yards.\r\n\r\n\"The colours of this curious creature are very vivid; the bladder,\r\nthough in some parts transparent and colourless, and in some specimens\r\nalmost entirely so, is in general painted with richest blues and purple,\r\nmingled with green and crimson to a smaller extent, these all being, not\r\nas sometimes described, iridescent or changeable, but positive colours\r\nindependent of the incidence of light, and, for the most part,\r\npossessing great depth and fulness. The sail-like, erectile membrane is\r\ntransparent, tinted towards the edge with a lovely rose-pink hue, the\r\ncolours arranged in a peculiar fringe-like manner. When examined\r\nanatomically, the bladder is found to be composed of two walls of\r\nmembrane, which are lined with cilia, and have between them the\r\nnutritive food which supplies the place of the blood. Besides this, the\r\ndouble membrane is turned in or inverted like a stocking prepared for\r\nputting on; and thus there is a bladder within a bladder, both having\r\ndouble walls; the inner (_pneumatocyst_) much smaller than the outer\r\n(_pneumatophone_), and contracted at the point where it is turned into\r\nthe almost imperceptible orifice. The inner sends up closed tubular\r\nfolds into the crest, which, being arrested by the membranous walls of\r\nthe outer sac, give to the sail that appearance of vertical wrinkles\r\nwhich is so conspicuous.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it is filled with air the body is almost projected out of the\r\nwater. In order to descend it is necessary to compress itself or dispel\r\nthe air, in part, for the centre of gravity in the animal is displaced\r\naccording as the air is in the vesicle or in the crest. When the last is\r\ndistended it rises out of the water, and becomes nearly vertical; in\r\nshort, it then becomes a sort of sail. The floating appendages beneath\r\nthe body are of divers kinds. Some of these are reproductive\r\nindividuals; some are nurses; some are tentacles; finally, there are\r\norgans designated under the name of _Sondes_ by French naturalists;\r\nprobes or suckers, we may call them, forming offensive and defensive\r\narms truly formidable; for these elegant creatures are terrible\r\nantagonists. Dutertre, the veracious historian of the Antilles, relates\r\nthe following: \"This 'galley' (our Physalia), however agreeable to the\r\nsight, is most dangerous to the body, for I can assert that it is\r\nfreighted with the worst merchandise which floats on the sea. I speak as\r\na naturalist, and as having made experiments at my own personal cost.\r\nOne day, when sailing at sea in a small boat, I perceived one of these\r\nlittle 'galleys,' and was curious to see the form of the animal; but I\r\nhad scarcely seized it, when all its fibres seemed to clasp my hand,\r\ncovering it as with birdlime, and scarcely had I felt it in all its\r\nfreshness (for it is very cold to the touch) when it seemed as if I had\r\nplunged my arm up to the shoulder in a caldron of boiling water. This\r\nwas accompanied with a pain so strange that it was only with a violent\r\neffort I could restrain myself from crying aloud.\"\r\n\r\nAnother voyager, Leblond, in his \"Voyage aux Antilles,\" relates as\r\nfollows: \"One day I was bathing with some friends in a bay in front of\r\nthe house where I dwelt. While my friends fished for sardines for\r\nbreakfast, I amused myself by diving, in the manner of the native\r\nCarribeans, under the wave about to break; having reached the other side\r\nof one great wave, I had gained the open sea, and was returning on the\r\ntop of the next wave towards the shore. My rashness nearly cost me my\r\nlife: a Physalia, many of which were stranded upon the beach, fixed\r\nitself upon my left shoulder at the moment the wave landed me on the\r\nbeach. I promptly detached it, but many of its filaments remained glued\r\nto my skin, and the pain I experienced immediately was so intense that I\r\nnearly fainted. I seized an oil flask which was at hand, and swallowed\r\none half, while I rubbed my arm with the other: this restored me to\r\nmyself, and I returned to the house, where two hours of repose relieved\r\nthe pain, which disappeared altogether during the night.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett, who accompanied the exploring expedition under Admiral\r\nFitzroy, as naturalist, ventured to test the powers of the Physalia. \"On\r\none occasion,\" he says, \"I tried the experiment of its stinging powers\r\nupon myself, intentionally. When I seized it by the bladder portion, it\r\nraised the long cables by muscular contraction of the bands situated at\r\nthe base of the feelers, and, entwining the slender appendages about my\r\nhand and finger, inflicting severe and peculiarly pungent pain, it\r\nadhered most tenaciously at the same time, so as to be extremely\r\ndifficult of removal. The stinging continued during the whole time that\r\nthe minutest portion of the tentacular remained adherent to the skin. I\r\nsoon found that the effects were not confined to the acute pungency\r\ninflicted, but produced a great degree of constitutional irritation: the\r\npain extended upwards along the arm, increasing not only in extent but\r\nin severity, apparently acting along the course of the absorbents, and\r\ncould only be compared to a severe rheumatic attack. The pulse was\r\naccelerated, and a feverish state of the whole system produced: the\r\nmuscles of the chest, even, were affected; the same distressing pain\r\nbeing felt on taking a full respiration as obtains in a case of acute\r\nrheumatism. The secondary effects were very severe, continuing for\r\nnearly three-quarters of an hour; the duration being probably longer in\r\nconsequence of the time and delay occasioned by removing the tentacula\r\nfrom the skin, to which they adhered, by the aid of the stinging\r\ncapsules, with an annoying degree of tenacity. On the whole being\r\nremoved, the pain began to abate; but during the day a peculiar numbness\r\nwas felt, accompanied by an increased temperature in the limb on which\r\nthe sting had been inflicted. For some hours afterwards the skin\r\ndisplayed white elevations or weals on the parts stung, similar to those\r\nresulting from the poison of the stinging nettle. The intensity of the\r\npain depends in some degree upon the size and consequent power of the\r\ncreature. After it has been removed from the water for some time, the\r\nstinging property, although still continuing to act, is found to have\r\nperceptibly diminished. I have observed, also, that this irritative\r\npower is retained for some weeks after the death of the animal, in the\r\nvesicles of the cables, and even linen cloth which has been used for\r\nwiping off the adhering tentacles, when touched, still retained the\r\npungency, although it had not the power of producing such violent\r\nconstitutional irritation.\"\r\n\r\nThe question has been much agitated, without being positively resolved,\r\nwhether the Physalia are venomous or not: if they can kill or make sick\r\nthe man or animal which swallows them. Listen to the opinions of M.\r\nRicord-Madiana, a physician of Guadaloupe, who made direct experiments\r\nwith a view to settling the question. \"Many inhabitants of the\r\nAntilles,\" he says, \"say that the 'galleys' are poisonous, and that the\r\nnegroes make use of them, after being dried and powdered, to poison both\r\nmen and animals. The fishermen of the islands also believe that fish\r\nwhich have swallowed them become deleterious, and poison those that eat\r\nthem, a prejudice which has been adopted by many travellers, and has\r\neven found its way into scientific books. We can state as the result of\r\ndirect experiment, that though the 'galley,' will burn the ignorant hand\r\nwhich is touched by its tentacles, when dried in the sun and pulverized,\r\nit becomes mere grains of dead matter, producing no effect whatever upon\r\nthe animal economy.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we read in P. Labat's Voyage, vol. ii. p. 31, \"that\r\nthe bécune should not be eaten without some precaution, for this fish\r\nbeing extremely voracious, greedily devours all that comes within its\r\nreach in and out of the water, and it often happens that it meets and\r\nswallows 'galleys,' which are very caustic, and a violent poison. The\r\nfish does not die, but its flesh absorbs the venom, and poisons those\r\nwho eat it.\" \"There is every reason to believe,\" says M. Leblond, in the\r\nwork already quoted, \"that the sardine, as well as many other species of\r\nfish, after having ate the tentacles of the 'galley,' acquires a\r\npoisonous quality. Supping at an auberge on one occasion, with other\r\npersons, a bécune was served up, of which gastronomers are very fond,\r\nand which is usually perfectly harmless: five persons partook of it, and\r\nimmediately afterwards exhibited every symptom of being poisoned. This\r\nwas manifested by a burning heat in the region of the stomach. I bled\r\ntwo of them: one was cured by vomiting; one other would take nothing but\r\ntea and some culinary oil. The colic continued during the night, and had\r\ndisappeared in the morning, but he entertained so great a horror of\r\nwater, that during the remainder of the voyage a glass of it presented\r\nto him made him turn pale.\" M. Leblond concludes, from this and other\r\nfacts, that the fishes which eat the Physalia become a poison for those\r\nwho eat them, although it does not appear that he had any evidence of\r\nthe fish having ate the \"galley,\" or any other poison.\r\n\r\n\"Let us report our own experiments,\" continues M. Ricord-Madiana.\r\n\r\n\"I. I had placed a 'galley' in the sun, in order to dry and pulverize\r\nit. A nest of ants were there, who devoured the whole of it. Now, many\r\npersons in the islands think that these insects will not touch venomous\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\n\"II. Another 'galley,' which I had left on the table in my laboratory,\r\nwas attacked by a number of great flies, who deposited their eggs there;\r\nthese were duly hatched, and the larvæ fed on the decomposed zoophyte.\r\n\r\n\"III. On the 12th of July, 1823, I saw on the sands in the bay between\r\nSaint Mary and La Goyave, at Guadaloupe, many Physalia recently cast\r\nashore. Having a dog with me, with the assistance of my servant, I made\r\nhim swallow the freshest of them, with all its filiform tentacles,\r\npushing it down his throat, while my servant held his mouth open; five\r\nminutes after, the dog exhibited symptoms of great pain on the edges of\r\nits lips; it foamed at the mouth and rubbed it in the sand, or upon the\r\ngrass, leaping about, passing its paws over its jaws, and exhibiting\r\nevery symptom of excessive pain. I mounted my horse, and, in spite of\r\nits sufferings, the poor animal followed me as it was wont. After twenty\r\nminutes, when its sufferings seemed over, I had a piece of bread which I\r\ngave it, and it ate it with appetite, swallowing it without any\r\ndifficulty; it only seemed to feel the pain on the edges of its mouth:\r\nit was well enough all day, and had evacuations which gave no indication\r\nthat the Physalia had any influence over the digestive organs. Next day,\r\nand the day following, it was as well as usual, exhibiting no signs of\r\ninflammation either in the mouth or throat.\r\n\r\n\"IV. On the 20th of the same month, I took two 'galleys' on the\r\nsea-shore and cut them in pieces; then, with a spoon, I had them forced\r\ndown the throat of a puppy, which still sucked its mother; this strong\r\ndose of Physalia had no effect upon it, the tentacles having probably\r\nbeen surrounded by the fleshy parts of the animal in dividing it, so as\r\nnot to touch the mouth: it seems probable, therefore, that the internal\r\nmucus is capable of subduing the irritation, which is so distressing\r\nwhen applied to membranes exposed to the external air. We swallow some\r\nthings with impunity, which we could not support in the mouth if the\r\nburning substance remained there.\r\n\r\n\"V. I have also procured many 'galleys' since these experiments, and\r\nhaving placed them in a glass tube, left them to dry and had them\r\npulverized; twenty-five grains of this powder administered to a very\r\nyoung dog produced no deleterious effects. Twice this quantity\r\nadministered to a young cat produced no more, nor has this surprised me;\r\nfor, if the fresh animal has no poisonous properties, how can it be\r\nsupposed that drying the zoophyte can have increased its poisonous\r\nproperties, if it really possesses them? On the contrary, it is more\r\nreasonable to suppose that, by desiccation, the deleterious principle\r\nfrom any animal, whether _Physalia_ or _Holothuria_, should lose\r\ninfinitely in its principle by evaporation, and other changes that heat\r\nand air produce in the process of drying.\r\n\r\n\"VI. I have had a 'galley' cut into pieces, and got a fat young chicken\r\nto swallow them. It caused no inconvenience. Three hours after, I had\r\nthe chicken killed and roasted; then I ate it, and made my servant eat\r\nit too. Neither of us experienced any inconvenience from it, a certain\r\nproof that it is not from eating Physalia that the fish becomes\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\n\"VII. I put twenty-five grains of powdered _Physalia_ in a little\r\n'bouillon;' I swallowed the dose without the least fear, and I felt no\r\ninconvenience from it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these experiments, which are certainly quite conclusive, what are\r\nwe to think of the story related of a certain M. Tébé, the managing\r\npartner of a house in Guadaloupe, who fell a victim to his cook, who is\r\nsaid, after having sought in vain to poison him with the rasping of his\r\nnails, which he had spread carefully over the roasted fish daily served\r\nup for dinner, determined, seeing that he had signally failed by other\r\nmeans, to put into his soup a pulverized Physalia. An hour after his\r\nrepast, this gentleman appeared in the burgh of Lamantin, at a little\r\ndistance from his habitation, and, while entering the city with some\r\nfriends, he was seized with violent pains in the stomach and intestines,\r\nracking him as if by the most corrosive poison. His illness increased\r\nuntil the next day, when he died, under the most excruciating pains. On\r\nexamination, the stomach and intestines were found to be violently\r\ninflamed and corroded, as if he had been poisoned with arsenic, and I\r\nhave no doubt that it was with this poison, or some other corrosive\r\nsubstance, that M. Tébé really was poisoned. The negroes never make\r\nknown the substance with which they commit a poisoning; they confess all\r\nbut the truth, which they are sworn never to reveal--the means they\r\nemploy, so far as the poisoning material is concerned, are never\r\ncommunicated by confession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102. Physalia utriculus (Eschscholtz).]\r\n\r\nThe habits of the Physalia are still imperfectly known, but among the\r\nmany strange forms of brilliant colour and elegant contour, which swarm\r\nin the warmer parts of the ocean, \"none,\" says Gosse, \"take a stronger\r\nhold on the fancy of the beholder; certainly none is more familiar than\r\nthe little thing he daily marks floating in the sun-lit waves, as the\r\nship glides swiftly by, which the sailors tell him is the Portuguese\r\nman-of-war. Perhaps a dead calm has settled over the sea, and he leans\r\nover the bulwarks of the ship scrutinizing the ocean-rover at leisure,\r\nas it hastily rises and falls on the long, sluggish heavings of the\r\nglassy surface. Then he sees that the comparison of the stranger to a\r\nship is a felicitous one, for at a little (Fig. 102) distance it might\r\nwell be mistaken for a child's mimic boat, shining in all the gaudy\r\npainting in which it left the toy-shop.\r\n\r\n\"Not unfrequently, one of these tiny vessels comes so close alongside,\r\nthat, by means of the ship's bucket, with the assistance of a smart\r\nfellow who has jumped into the 'chains' with a boat-hook, it is\r\ncaptured, and brought on deck for examination. A dozen voices are,\r\nhowever, lifted, warning you by no means to touch it, for well the\r\nexperienced sailor knows its terrible powers of defence. It does not now\r\nappear so like a ship as when it was at a distance. It is an oblong\r\nbladder of tough membrane, varying considerably in shape, for no two\r\nagree in this respect; varying also in size, from less than an inch to\r\nthe size of a man's hat. Once, on a voyage to Mobile, when rounding the\r\nFlorida reef, I was nearly a whole day passing through a fleet of these\r\nlittle Portuguese men-of-war, which studded the smooth sea as far as the\r\neye could reach, and must have extended for many miles. They were of all\r\nsizes within the limits I have mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nGenerally, there is a conspicuous difference between the two extremities\r\nof the bladder, one end being rounded, the other more pointed, or\r\nterminating in a small knob-like swelling or beak-shaped excrescence,\r\nwhere there is a minute orifice; sometimes, however, no such excrescence\r\nis visible, and the orifice cannot be detected.\r\n\r\n\"That wonderful river,\" continues Mr. Gosse, in his nervous, eloquent\r\nstyle, \"with a well-defined course through the midst of the\r\nAtlantic--that Gulf Stream--brings on its warm waters many of the\r\ndenizens of tropical seas, and wafts them to the shores on which its\r\nwaves impinge. Hence it is that so many of the proper pelagic creatures\r\nare from time to time observed on the coasts of Cornwall and Devon. The\r\nPortuguese man-of-war is among them, sometimes paying its visit in\r\nfleets, more commonly in single stranded hulks. Scarcely a season passes\r\nwithout one or more of these lovely strangers occurring in the vicinity\r\nof Torquay. Usually,\" he adds in a note, \"in these stranded examples the\r\ntentacles and suckers are much mutilated by washing on the shore. The\r\nfishermen who pick them up always endeavour to make a harvest of their\r\ncapture, not by selling, but by making an exhibition of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Physalia seem to be gregarious in their habits, herding together in\r\nshoals. Floating on the sea between the tropics in both oceans, they may\r\nbe seen now carried along by currents, now driven by the trade-winds,\r\ndragging behind them their long tentacular appendages, and conspicuous\r\nby their rich and varied colouring, from pale crimson to ultramarine\r\nblue. \"Certainly,\" says Lesson, \"we can readily conceive that a poetical\r\nimagination might well compare the graceful form of the Physalia to the\r\nmost elegant of sailing-vessels, even if it careened to the wind under a\r\nsail of satin, and dragged behind it deceitful garlands which struck\r\nwith death every creature which suffered itself to be attracted by its\r\nseductive appearance.\"\r\n\r\nIf fishes have the misfortune to come in contact with one of these\r\ncreatures, each tentacle, by a movement as rapid as a flash of light, or\r\nsudden as an electric shock, seizes and benumbs them, winding round\r\ntheir bodies as a serpent winds itself round its victim. A Physalia of\r\nthe size of a walnut will kill a fish much stronger than a herring. The\r\nflying fish and the polyps are the habitual prey of the Physalia. Mr.\r\nBennett describes them as seizing and benumbing them by means of the\r\ntentacles, which are alternately contracted to half an inch, and then\r\nshot out with amazing velocity to the length of several feet, dragging\r\nthe helpless and entangled prey to the sucker-like mouths and\r\nstomach-like cavities concealed among the tentacles, which he saw filled\r\nwhile he looked on. Dr. Wallach thinks Mr. Bennett must have been\r\nmistaken in what he saw; \"because he has observed that in a great number\r\nof instances the Physalia is accompanied by small fishes, which play\r\naround and among the depending tentacles without molestation. He has in\r\nso many cases seen this, and even witnessed the actual contact of the\r\nfishes with the tentacles, with no inconvenience to the former, that he\r\ntoo hastily concludes that the urticating organs are innocuous.\"\r\n\"Surely,\" says Gosse, \"the premises by no means warrant such an\r\ninference. There is no antagonism between the two series of facts\r\nwitnessed by such excellent observers; the venomous virulence of these\r\norgans has been abundantly proved by many naturalists, myself among the\r\nnumber, and Mr. Bennett to his cost, as already narrated. We can only\r\nsuppose that the injection of the poison is under the control of the\r\nPhysalia's will, and the impunity of the bold little fishes is\r\nsufficiently accounted for.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Physalia captured on our coast, one was obtained at Tenby, by\r\nMr. Hughes, who has given a report of the capture, in which he mentions\r\na circumstance as \"normal,\" which excited Mr. Gosse's curiosity; it was\r\nsaid to be accompanied by \"its attendant satellites, two _Vilellæ_. In\r\nreply to his inquiries\", Mr. Hughes says, \"My authority for the\r\nassociation of the Vilella with Physalia is Jenkins, the collector of\r\nTenby, who was attending me when it was found. The Physalia was taken by\r\nme first; and, while I was admiring it, I noticed that Jenkins continued\r\nhis search for something. Immediately afterwards he came up with the\r\nVilella in his hand, at the same time stating they were generally found\r\nwith the Portuguese man-of-war. As I had found him very honest and\r\ntruthful in his dealings with me, I accepted his information as\r\ncorrect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCTENOPHORA.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the last class of polyps; those, namely, which\r\nCuvier designates _Hydrostatic Acalepha_, and which De Blainville calls\r\nthe _Ciliobranchiá_. The body of these polyps presents marginal fringes\r\nfurnished with vibratile cilia, which are swimming organs. Moreover, as\r\nthese vibratile fringes are inserted directly over the principal canal,\r\nin which the nourishing fluid circulates, they ought necessarily to\r\nconcur in the act of respiration, by determining the renewal of the\r\nwater in contact with the corresponding portion of the tegumentary\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\nThe class may be divided into three orders or families, namely, _Beröe_,\r\n_Callianirea_, and _Cestea_.\r\n\r\nThe creatures belonging to these three orders swarm in the deep sea;\r\nthey often appear quite suddenly, and in vast numbers, in certain\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103. Beros Forskahli (Edwards).]\r\n\r\nThe _Beröes_ of Forskahl have been studied with great care by Mr. Milne\r\nEdwards. They inhabit the Gulf of Naples, and other parts of the\r\nMediterranean; the sailors of Provence call them Sea-cucumbers. The body\r\n(Fig. 103), cylindrical in form, is of a pale rose colour, thickly\r\nstudded with small reddish spots, so numerous as to appear entirely\r\npunctured with them. It presents eight blue sides, with very fine\r\nvibratile cilia, which by their reflection produce all the colours of\r\nthe rainbow. The substance of the body is gelatinous, its appearance\r\nglass-like; its form varies according as the animal is in motion or\r\nrepose. Sometimes it swells up like a ball; sometimes it reverses\r\nitself, so as to resemble a bell; at others it is elongated and\r\ncylindrical; at its lower extremity it presents a large mouth; at its\r\nupper extremity is found a small nipple, having at its base a spherical\r\npoint of a reddish colour, enclosing many crystalloid corpuscles, which\r\nrest upon a sort of nervous ganglion, whose physiological function is\r\nnot very well determined. A vast stomach, considering its size, occupies\r\nthe whole interior of the body of the Beröe: the circulation is also\r\nmuch developed in this zoophyte. The circulating apparatus contains a\r\nmoving fluid charged with a multitude of circular, colourless globules,\r\nwhich flows from a vascular ring round the mouth towards the summit of\r\nthe body; in the interior are eight superficial canals, which flow under\r\nthe ciliated sides, and redescend by two much deeper canals; but the\r\nBeröes have no heart. _Beröe ovata_ is a beautiful species, seldom\r\nexceeding three inches and a half in length, and two and a half in its\r\nlarger transverse diameter; is described by Browne, in his \"Jamaica,\" as\r\n\"of an oval form, obtusely octangular, hollow, open at the larger\r\nextremity, transparent, and of a firm gelatinous consistence; it\r\ncontracts and widens with great facility, but is always open and\r\nexpanded when it swims or moves. The longitudinal radii are strongest in\r\nthe crown or smallest extremity where they rise from a very beautiful\r\noblong star, and diminish gradually from thence to the margin, each\r\nbeing furnished with a single series of short, slender, delicate\r\nappendages, or limbs (cilia), that move with great celerity in all\r\ndirections, as the creature pleases to direct its flexions, and in a\r\nregular accelerated succession from the top to the margin. It is\r\nimpossible to express the liveliness of the motions of those delicate\r\norgans, or the beautiful variety of colour which rise from them to play\r\nto and fro in the rays of the sun; nor is it easy to express the speed\r\nand regularity with which the motions succeed each other from one end of\r\nthe rays to the other.\" \"The grace and beauty which the entire apparatus\r\npresents in the living animal,\" says Gosse, \"or the marvellous ease and\r\nrapidity with which it can be alternately contracted, extended, and bent\r\nat an infinite variety of angles, no verbal description can sufficiently\r\ntreat. Fortunately the creature is so common in summer and autumn on all\r\nour coasts, that few who use the surface can possibly miss its capture.\r\nIt is worthy of a poet's description, which it has received:--\r\n\r\n    'When first extracted from her native brine,\r\n    Behold a round, small mass of gelatine,\r\n    Or frozen dewdrop, void of life and limb;\r\n    But round the crystal goblet let her swim\r\n    'Midst her own elements; and lo! a sphere\r\n    Banded from pole to pole; as diamond clear,\r\n    Shaped as bard's fancy shapes the small balloon,\r\n    To bear some sylph or fay beyond the moon.\r\n    From all her bands see lurid fringes play,\r\n    That glance and sparkle in the solar ray\r\n    With iridescent hues. Now round and round\r\n    She whirls and twirls; now mounts, then sinks profound.'\"\r\n\r\n          DRUMMOND.\r\n\r\nBesides the Beröe, naturalists place the Cydippa, which is frequently\r\nconfounded with the former. The Cydippæ are globulous or egg-shaped,\r\nfurnished with eight rows of cilia, corresponding with as many sections\r\nmore or less distinct, and terminated by two long filiform tentacles\r\nissuing from the base of the zoophyte and fringed on the sides. \"It is,\"\r\nsays Gosse, \"a globe of pure colourless jelly, about as big as a small\r\nmarble, often with a wart-like swelling at one of its poles, where the\r\nmouth is placed. At the other end there are minute orifices, and between\r\nthe two passes the stomach, which is flat or wider in one diameter than\r\nthe other.\" _Cydippe pileus_, found abundantly in the spring on the\r\nBelgian coast, is so transparent that it is scarcely visible in the\r\nwater, where it seems like living, moving crystal. _C. densa_, which\r\nabounds in the Mediterranean, is of a crystalline white, with rows of\r\nreddish cirrhi, terminating in two tentacles, much longer and coloured\r\nred; it is about the size of a hazel-nut, and phosphorescent. Within the\r\nclear substance of the _Cydippe_, on each side of the stomach, there is\r\na capacious cavity, which communicates with the surface, and within each\r\ncavity is fixed the tentacle, of great length and very slender, which\r\nthe animal can at pleasure shoot out of the orifice and suffer to trail\r\nthrough the water, shortening, lengthening, twisting, twining, or\r\ncontracting it into a tiny ball at will, or withdrawing it into its\r\ncavity, short filaments being given off at intervals over the whole\r\nlength of this attenuated white thread-like apparatus, each of which can\r\nalso be lengthened or shortened, and coiled individually. These proceed\r\nonly from one side of the thread-like tentacle, although, at a casual\r\nglance, they seem to proceed now from one side, now from the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLIANIRA.\r\n\r\nThe Callianira form a sort of connecting link between the _Beröes_\r\nand the _Cestidæ_. Their bodies are smooth and regular,\r\nvertically-elongated, compressed on one side and as if lobated on the\r\nother; in substance they are gelatinous, hyalin, and tubular, obtuse at\r\nboth extremities, with buccal openings between the prolongations of the\r\nside, and two pair of conical appendages resembling wings, capable of\r\nexpansion, on the edges of which two rows of vibratory cilia are ranged.\r\nA great transversal opening presents itself at one of the extremities, a\r\nsmall one at the other. The animal is furnished with two branching\r\ntentacles, but without cilia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCESTIDÆ.\r\n\r\nIn _Cestum_, or Venus's Girdle, as it is vulgarly called, we have a\r\nlong, gelatinous, ribbon-like body, fine, regular, and very short, but\r\nmuch extended on each side, while the edges are furnished with a double\r\nrow of cilia; the lower surface is also furnished with cilia, but much\r\nsmaller in size and number. On the middle of the lower edge is the\r\nmouth, opening into a large stomach. This alimentary canal runs across\r\nthe middle of its length, and from it extends, as in the Medusæ, a\r\nseries of gastric canals, which carry the nutriment into all parts of\r\nthe body. There are many species of Cestum; among them the best known is\r\n_C. veneris_ (Fig. 104), which is found in the Mediterranean,\r\nparticularly in the sea which bathes the coast of Naples and Nice, where\r\nthe fishermen call it the _sabre de mer_--sea-sabre. This curious\r\nzoophyte unwinds itself on the bosom of the waters, like a scarf of\r\niridescent shades. It is the scarf of Venus traversing the waves, under\r\nthe fiery rays of the sun, which has coloured it with a thousand\r\nreflections of silver and azure blue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104. Cestum veneris (Lesueur).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nECHINODERMATA.\r\n\r\n\"Ultra magis pisces et Echinos æquora celent.\"--_Hor. Ep._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their \"Natural History of the Echinodermata,\" Messrs. Hupé and\r\nDujardin divide this vast natural group into five orders or families,\r\nnamely: 1, _Asteroïdæ_, which includes the true star-fishes; 2,\r\n_Crinoïdæ_, stone lilies, calcareous, stem composed of movable pieces;\r\n3, _Ophiuræ_, having the disk much depressed, the rays simple, and\r\nfurnished with short stems; 4, _Echinidæ_, comprehending the animals\r\nknown as sea-eggs, or sea-urchins, distinguished by their rounded form\r\nand absence of arms; 5, _Holothuroïdæ_, with soft lengthened cylindrical\r\nbody, covered with scattered suckers.\r\n\r\nThe Echinodermata, from the Greek words ἐχῖνοϛ, rough, and\r\nδέρμα, skin; indicating an animal bristling with spines like\r\nthe hedgehog's. They are animals sometimes free, sometimes attached by\r\na stem, flexible or otherwise, and radiating, that is, presenting an\r\nappearance more or less regular in all its parts, after the manner of\r\na circle or star, its form being globular, egg-shaped, cylindrical, or\r\nlike a pentagonal plate; or, lastly, like a star, with more or less\r\nelongated branches, which secrete either in all their tissues or only\r\nin the integument very numerous symmetrical calcareous plates of solid\r\nmatter, sometimes forming an internal skeleton or regular shell covered\r\nwith a more or less consistent skin, often pierced with holes, from\r\nwhich the feet or tentacula issue; they are frequently furnished with\r\nappendices of various kinds, such as prickles, scales, &c.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Echinodermata is the most perfect of all the\r\nzoophytes, serving as a transition between them and animals of more\r\ncomplicated frame. They have a digestive and vascular system, and a\r\nmuscular system is almost always present; in short, they have internal\r\nor external respiratory organs, and a rudimentary nervous system has\r\nbeen detected in many of the species. The nutritive system is very\r\nsimple, presenting in most of the family a single orifice in the centre\r\nof the lower surface of the body, destitute of teeth, performing the\r\nfunctions both of mouth and anus. De Blainville says that \"the liver is\r\napparent and rather considerable in the star-fishes, forming bunches\r\noccupying the whole circumference of the stomach, and extending to the\r\ncavities of the appendages where these exist.\" The mouth and gullet is\r\nadmirably adapted for securing the testaceous mollusks and other\r\nsubstances on which they feed.\r\n\r\nReproduction in the Echinodermata appears to be monoecious. Ovaries are,\r\nas far as is known, the only organs of generation. They vary in number\r\nin different species. The sexes are usually separate: the young are\r\nproduced by eggs, the embryo of which undergo important metamorphoses.\r\nImmediately after birth, the young asteriæ have a depressed and rounded\r\nbody, with four club-shaped appendages or arms at their anterior\r\nextremity. When they are a little more developed, papillæ may be\r\nobserved on the upper surface, in fine radiating rows: after twelve days\r\nthe fine rays begin to increase, and after eight days more two rows of\r\nfeet, or tentacula, are developed under each ray, which assist in the\r\nlocomotion of the animal by alternate elongation and contraction,\r\nperforming also the office of suckers. Like most other zoophytes, they\r\nhave the power of reproducing parts of their bodies which may have been\r\naccidentally destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTERIAS, OR STAR-FISHES.\r\n\r\nAs to the animal which commonly and sometimes scientifically bears the\r\nname of Star-fish, in walking on the sea-shore at low tide, your eyes\r\nhave often seen this strange creature half buried in the sand. It is so\r\nregular and geometrical in its form that it has more the appearance of\r\nbeing the production of man's hand than of a creation which breathes and\r\nmoves. The Divine Geometrician who created it never realised a creature\r\nmore regularly finished in shape, or more perfectly harmonious in\r\nsymmetry.\r\n\r\nThe _star-fish_ has five perfectly equal arms. They resemble a cross of\r\nhonour, which has five branches. The _star of the brave_, the _star of\r\nhonour_--these somewhat trivial words recall, nevertheless, the\r\nresemblance which exists between the two objects; doubtless, man has\r\nhere taken Nature for his copy. It must, however, be remarked that,\r\nthough five is the general number of lines in the star-fish, this number\r\nis not constant; it varies with different genera, species, and even with\r\nindividuals. The connection of the arms with the disk presents equally\r\nremarkable differences. In the genus _Culcita_, the disk is so much\r\ndeveloped that it constitutes, so to speak, the entire animal, whilst\r\nthe arms form only a slight protuberance upon its circumference. In the\r\ngenera _Luidia_, on the contrary, the disk is reduced to minimum, whilst\r\nthe arms are of great length and very slender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105. Asterias rubens (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe colours of the _star-fish_ vary greatly; they vary from a\r\nyellowish-grey, a yellow-orange, a garnet-red, to a dark violet, as\r\ntheir name indicates.\r\n\r\n_Star-fishes_ are exclusively and essentially beings of the sea; they\r\nare never seen in fresh water; they dwell amongst the submarine herbage,\r\nseeking for sandy coasts; they generally are found at moderate depths,\r\nbut there are some species which are found at the great depth of a\r\nhundred and fifty fathoms.\r\n\r\nAsterias are met with in almost every sea and under all latitudes, but\r\nthey are most numerous and their forms are more richly varied in the\r\nseas of tropical regions. There are about a hundred and forty species\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106. Asterias aurantiaca (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe body of the Asteria is supported by a calcareous envelope composed\r\nof juxta-posed pieces at once various and numerous. The number of these\r\npieces is estimated at more than eleven thousand in the Red Sea\r\nStar-fish (_Asterias rubens_, Fig. 105), a species very common in\r\nEurope. The body of the _Asterias rubens_ is likewise furnished with\r\nspines, granules, and tubercules, the shape, number, and disposition of\r\nwhich serve to characterise the genera and the species.\r\n\r\nAnother species, _Asterias aurantiaca_, will give an exact idea of the\r\ngeneral type of animals of this order. This zoophyte, which is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 106, is common in the northern seas; it has five\r\nrather long arms, furnished with spines which are of an orange\r\ncolour--hence its name. When we see one of these animals stranded upon\r\nthe shore, it appears to be entirely destitute of all power of\r\nprogression. But the _star-fish_ is not always immovable; it is provided\r\nwith an apparatus for locomotion, which appears to serve at the same\r\ntime the purposes of respiration; for nature is not sparing in her gifts\r\nto the least organized beings; she bestows upon them feet, with\r\nrespiratory organs, or lungs, which have the power of locomotion.\r\n\r\nThe muscular system, as already stated, is almost always present in the\r\nEchinodermata, but the organs of locomotion are very various, the\r\nprincipal being the membranous tubes usually termed feet, or ambulacra,\r\nwhich issue from the ambulacral apertures; but besides these, the rays\r\nthemselves are movable, and in animals which are free to move from place\r\nto place these are used for the purpose. Thus in the common star-fish\r\nthe rays may be bent towards the upper or lower surface of the disk, so\r\nas to facilitate its advance either in water over small spaces or up the\r\nvertical face of rocks. These ambulacra are very numerous, disposed in\r\nrows along the under surface of the rays; thus in _A. aurantiaca_ there\r\nare two simple rows of feet attached to each ray, and the vesicular part\r\nis deeply cleft into two lobes; while in _A. rubens_ (Fig. 105) there\r\nare two double rows on each ray, and each foot has an undivided vesicle.\r\n\r\nEach of these ambulacra consists of two parts, an internal and generally\r\nvesicular portion placed within the body, and a tubular portion outside,\r\nprojecting from the surface through an aperture in the skin or shell,\r\nthe tube being closed at the extremity, and terminating in a sucker,\r\nusually in the form of a disk slightly depressed in the centre. The feet\r\nare thus muscular fleshy cylinders, hollow in the centre, and very\r\nextensible; by means of them the animal draws itself forward. The foot\r\nis extended by the contraction of its internal vesicle, which forces the\r\nfluid into the hollow tube, or, where the vesicle is wanting, by\r\nprojecting the fluid into the tube by a communicating vessel. The\r\ntubular part is thus distended and elongated, and again retracts itself\r\nby means of its muscular fibres, by which action the fluid is forced\r\nback into the interior. In progression the animal extends a few of its\r\nfeet, attaches its suckers to the rocks or stones, then, by shortening\r\nits feet, it draws its body forward. The progression of the Asterias is\r\nthus very slow, and so regular that only the closest observation enables\r\nthe spectator to discover the movement which produces it. Like the\r\nmovements of the hands of a watch, the eye cannot quite follow it. When\r\nan obstacle presents itself--if, for example, a stone comes in its\r\nway--it raises one of the rays in order to obtain a point of support,\r\nthen a second ray, and, if necessary, a third,--and thus the animal\r\ncreeps over the stone with as much ease as if it walked over the smooth\r\nsands. In the same way the animal creeps up perpendicular rocks, which\r\nis accomplished by means of these ambulacra and suckers. Frédol says:\r\n\"If an Asteria is turned upon its back it will at first remain\r\nimmovable, with its feet shut up. Soon, however, out come the feet, like\r\nso many little feelers; it moves them backward and forward, as if\r\nfeeling for the ground; it soon inclines them towards the bottom of the\r\nvase, and fixes them one after the other. When it has a sufficient\r\nnumber attached the animal turns itself round. It is not impossible,\r\nwhilst walking on the sea-shore, to have the pleasure of seeing one of\r\nthese star-fishes walking upon the sand. A day rarely passes without one\r\nof them being thrown upon the strand by the tide, and then abandoned by\r\nthe retreating waters. Generally they are left dead; this is not always\r\nthe case, however; they are sometimes only benumbed. Place them in a\r\nvase full of sea-water, or simply in a pool on the shore, and you will\r\nsometimes see them recover from this death-like condition, and execute\r\nthe curious movements of progression which we have described.\" The\r\nmotions of an Asterias thus saved form a very curious spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of this animal is situated on the lower surface of the disk.\r\nAt this point the constitutive pieces of the carapace leave a circular\r\nspace, covered by a fibrous resistant membrane, pierced at the centre by\r\na rounded opening. This opening is sometimes armed with hard papillæ,\r\nwhich play the part of teeth. The mouth almost directly abuts on the\r\nstomach, which is merely a globular sac, filling nearly all the central\r\nportion of the visceral cavity.\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" says Mr. Milne Edwards, \"in _Asteracanthion glacialis_ the\r\nstomach is globulous, but imperfectly divided into two parts by a fold\r\nof its internal membrane; the first chamber, thus limited, appears to be\r\nmore especially devoted to the transformation of the elementary matter\r\ninto a liquid paste, which passes, in small portions, into the upper\r\nchamber. This is continued upward through a small intestine, and\r\ncommunicates laterally with five cylindrical prolongations, which each\r\ndivide themselves again into two much elongated tubes, furnished with a\r\ndouble series of hollow branches, each terminating in a cul-de-sac.\"\r\nThese organs advance into the interior of the rays or arms of the\r\nAsterias.\r\n\r\nImagine, then, an animal bearing digestive tubes in its arms--the same\r\norgan serving for digestion and progression. What lessons in economy\r\ndoes not the study of nature teach us! The products of digestion find an\r\nabsorbent surface of great extent in the rays of the Asterias. They\r\nought necessarily to pass rapidly from it into the circumjacent\r\nnourishing fluid.\r\n\r\nThe star-fishes are very voracious; they even attack mollusks which are\r\ncovered with shells. M. Pouchett mentions having taken eighteen\r\nspecimens of _Venus_ intact, each being six lines in length, from the\r\nstomach of one large Asterias which he dissected upon the shores of the\r\nMediterranean. It is now even said that the star-fishes eat many\r\noysters.\r\n\r\nAncient naturalists were not ignorant that the star-fish was capable of\r\neating oysters; but they believed that they waited for the moment when\r\nthe bivalve would open its valves to introduce one of their rays into\r\nthe opening. They imagined that having thus put one foot into the\r\nother's domicile, they soon put four, and finished by reaching and\r\ndevouring the savoury inhabitant of the shell. Modern observations have\r\nmodified the ideas of former naturalists upon this point. In order to\r\nobtain possession of and swallow an oyster, it appears that the\r\nstar-fish begins its approaches by bringing its mouth to the closed\r\nedges of the oyster-shell; this done, with the assistance of a\r\nparticular liquid which its mouth secretes, it injects a few drops of an\r\nacrid or venomous liquid into the interior of the oyster-shell, which\r\nforces it to open its valves. An entrance once obtained, it is not long\r\nbefore it is invaded and ravaged. Professor Rymer Jones gives another\r\nexplanation of the transaction. According to this naturalist the oyster\r\nis seized between the rays of his ravisher, and held under his mouth by\r\nthe aid of his suckers; the Asteria then inverts its stomach, according\r\nto the professor, and envelopes the entire oyster in its inmost\r\nrecesses, while, doubtless, distilling a poisonous liquid. The victim is\r\nthus forced to open its shell, and becomes the prey of the enemy which\r\nenvelopes it.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the modes of procedure employed by the star-fish, it is\r\nnow clearly ascertained, however incredible the fact may at first\r\nappear, that it swallows oysters in the same manner as is practised at\r\nthe oyster-shop.\r\n\r\nThis little being, formed of five arms and without any other apparent\r\nmember, accomplishes a work which man is quite unable to execute--it\r\nopens an oyster without an oyster-knife.\r\n\r\nIf reasoning man had no other means of nourishment than oysters, and was\r\nwithout a knife to open them, it is very certain that with all his\r\ngenius he would be puzzled how to get at the inaccessible and savoury\r\nbivalve so obstinately closed against him. The star-fish devours dead\r\nflesh of all kinds; their sole occupation is to feed themselves, and\r\nthey keep up an incessant and active chase after all sorts of corrupt\r\nanimal matter. The Asterias thus perform in the bosom of the sea the\r\nsame part that certain birds and insects play on shore; they are its\r\nscavengers, and feed their bodies upon the carcases of animals which, if\r\nabandoned to the action of the elements, would become a cause of\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner that certain animals render the air healthy, the\r\nAsterias help, on a considerable scale, to keep the sea which shelters\r\nthem in a pure and healthy state. Zoologists are not agreed upon the\r\nmanner in which respiration operates on the star-fishes. Nevertheless\r\nthey think that the principal part in this phenomenon devolves upon the\r\nsubcutaneous branchiæ which in each ray constitute two double series of\r\nbladders. The function of circulation is equally unknown. The vascular\r\napparatus is sufficiently developed in this zoophyte, and appears to\r\nhave for its centre an elongated canal with muscular walls, which may\r\nwith justice be honoured with the name of heart. A little ring\r\nsurrounding the oesophagus, and from which issue certain delicate white\r\nchords, which are prolonged into the furrows of the arms, presents us\r\nwith all that can be designated a nervous system in the star-fishes.\r\nAmong organs of sense we may mention, as the apparatus of touch, the\r\n_tentacular ambulacra_, as well as those which are disseminated upon the\r\ndorsal surface of the disk. The eyes are considered to be certain\r\nbright red points which are situated at the extremity of the arms and on\r\nthe under surface--a most singular position for the organs of sight. The\r\neyes must, besides, be very imperfect, for they possess no crystalline\r\nlens. Ehrenberg insists upon the existence of eyes in some species,\r\nattributing the function to those red spots, however; while Rymer Jones\r\nattributes the indications in which this originates to an extremely\r\ndelicate sense of touch in the star-fishes. Professor Edward Forbes,\r\nwhile he admits the existence of ganglions in the nervous system to be\r\nextremely doubtful, seems, by the frequent use of the terms eye and\r\neyelids, to admit that the specks in question are visual organs; the\r\nweight of authority inclines therefore to Ehrenberg's view, that if not\r\neyes in the strict sense of the term, they serve the purposes of vision,\r\nmodified and adapted to the wants of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe star-fishes have distinct sexes, with individual differences; their\r\neggs, which are round and reddish, undergo curious phases of\r\ndevelopment. They produce little worm-like creatures, covered with\r\nvibratile hairs, like the infusoria, which swim about with great\r\nvivacity; these little creatures are subject to considerable changes. In\r\nthe year 1835 M. Sars described, under the name of _Bipinnaria\r\nasterigera_, an enigmatical animal resembling a polyp from the arms at\r\none extremity of the body, while the other terminated in a tail,\r\nfurnished with two fins; but it was chiefly remarkable as having an\r\nAsterias attached to the extremity which carried the arm. He expressed\r\nan opinion, which was soon placed beyond any doubt, that this\r\n_bipinnaria_ was an Asterias in its course of development. The egg\r\nbecomes a sort of infusoria, the infusoria becomes a _bipinnaria_, and\r\nthis produces the Asterias. In short, the Bipinnaria does not become an\r\nAsterias by any metamorphoses analogous to that so well known amongst\r\ninsects--the butterfly, for example--but becomes, so to speak, the\r\nfoster-mother or nurse to the Bipinnaria. The larva is large, and it is\r\nat the cost of a very small internal rudiment of this larva that the\r\nAsterias is developed: the Asterias robs the larva of its stomach and\r\nintestines, and turns it into a visceral apparatus for its own use. But\r\nthe Asterias makes itself a mouth of any of the pieces most remote from\r\nthe primitive mouth of the larva. Thus the Bipinnaria divides itself; it\r\ngives its stomach and intestines, and keeps its oesophagus and mouth,\r\nand it can live several days after the Asterias is detached from it.\r\n\r\nCan any one imagine the existence of a being with only a mouth and\r\noesophagus, which has neither stomach nor intestines, because another\r\nanimal has possessed itself of them for its own use? The study of the\r\nlower animals abounds in surprises of this kind. It is a chain of\r\nunforeseen facts; of natural impossibilities; of realized points\r\nnecessarily reversing all notions obtained in the study of beings which\r\nhave a higher place in the animal scale. The history of the star-fishes\r\nwould be incomplete were we to omit mentioning the most remarkable\r\ntraits of their organisation with which naturalists are acquainted. The\r\nanimals exhibit in the highest degree the vital phenomena of\r\ndismemberment and restoration, that is to say, of the faculty of\r\nreconstructing organs which they have lost. These arms, the structure of\r\nwhich is so complicated, and which protect such important organs, may be\r\ndestroyed by accident. The animal troubles itself little at this\r\nmutilation: if he loses an arm it disquiets him but little; another is\r\nimmediately procured. We often see in our collections of Asterias\r\nspecimens wanting in symmetry because they have been taken before the\r\nnew members which are in process of development have attained their\r\ndefinite length. Professor Rymer Jones mentions an instance of\r\nredintegration very complete and most curious. This naturalist had an\r\nisolated ray of Asterias which he had picked up; at the end of five days\r\nhe observed that four little rays and a mouth had been produced; at the\r\nend of a month the old ray was completely destroyed, and this apparently\r\nuseless fragment had been replaced by a new being, quite perfect, with\r\nfour little symmetrical branches. This faculty of reproducing organs,\r\nwhich we have noted in describing the fresh water polyps, the sea\r\nanemone, &c., exists also in many other zoophytes, but in none more\r\nstrikingly than in the Asterias. But a still more startling fact remains\r\nto be mentioned: one more strange and more mysterious, for it does not\r\nbelong to the physical or organic order, but appears to belong to the\r\nmoral world. The star-fishes commit suicide! Certain of these animals\r\nappear to escape from dangers which menace them by self-destruction.\r\nThis power of putting an end to existence we only find on the highest\r\nand lowest steps of the animal scale. Man and the star-fishes have a\r\ncommon moral platform, and it is that of self-destruction! This power of\r\ndismemberment, however, seems to be confined to the _Ophiocoma_ and\r\n_Luidia_--at least, it is only carried out to its full extent in these\r\ngeneræ.\r\n\r\nMysteries of Nature, who can sound your depths? Secrets of the moral\r\nworld, what being but God has the privilege of comprehending you? A\r\nlarge species of Star-fish (_Luidia fragillissima_), which inhabits the\r\nEnglish seas, has this instinct of suicide to a great extent. The\r\nfollowing account by Professor Edward Forbes of an attempt to capture a\r\nLuidia gives a good illustration of its powers. \"The first time that I\r\ntook one of these creatures,\" the professor says, \"I succeeded in\r\nplacing it entire in my boat. Not having seen one before, and being\r\nignorant of its suicidal powers, I spread it out on a rowing bench, the\r\nbetter to admire its form and colours. On attempting to remove it for\r\npreservation, to my horror and disappointment I found only an assemblage\r\nof detached members. My conservative endeavours were all neutralised by\r\nits destructive exertions; and the animal is now badly represented in my\r\ncabinet by a diskless arm and an armless disk. Next time I went to\r\ndredge at the same spot I determined not to be cheated out of my\r\nspecimen a second time. I carried with me a bucket of fresh water, for\r\nwhich the star-fishes evince a great antipathy. As I hoped, a Luidia\r\nsoon came up in the dredge--a most gorgeous specimen. As the animal does\r\nnot generally break up until it is raised to the surface of the sea, I\r\ncarefully and anxiously plunged my bucket to a level with the dredge's\r\nmouth, and softly introduced the Luidia into the fresh water. Whether\r\nthe cold was too much for it, or the sight of the bucket was too\r\nterrific, I do not know; but in a moment it began to dissolve its\r\ncorporation, and I saw its limbs escaping through every mesh of the\r\ndredge. In my despair I seized the largest piece, and brought up the\r\nextremity of an arm with its terminal eye, the spinous eyelid of which\r\nopened and closed with something exceedingly like a wink of derision.\"\r\n\r\nThe mind remains confounded before such spectacles, and we can only say,\r\nwith Mallebranche, \"It is well to comprehend clearly that there are some\r\nthings which are absolutely incomprehensible.\"\r\n\r\nThis is doubtless the reason that in collections of natural history we\r\nrarely find star-fishes, and especially the Luidia, entire; the moment\r\nthe animal is seized by fisherman or amateur, in its terror or despair\r\nit breaks itself up into small fragments. To preserve them whole they\r\nmust be killed suddenly, before they have time to be aware of their\r\ndanger. For this purpose, the moment they are drawn from the sea they\r\nmust be plunged into a vase of cold fresh water; this saltless liquid\r\nis instant death to these creatures, which in this condition perish\r\nsuddenly before they have time to mutilate themselves. The star-fish is\r\na curious ornament in our natural history collections, but in this state\r\nthey represent very imperfectly the elegance and particular grace of\r\nthis curious type. To understand the star-fishes, they must be seen in\r\nan aquarium, where we can admire the form, figure, movements, and\r\nmanners of these marvellous beings.\r\n\r\nThe Asterias are the planets of the sea. It may be said that heaven,\r\nreflected during the night on the silvery surface of the ocean, let fall\r\nsome of those stars into its depths which decorate the resplendent\r\nvault.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRINOÏDEA.\r\n\r\nWe quoted the maxim of Linnæus in the earlier pages of this volume, that\r\nNature makes no leaps. Nature proceeds by means of insensible\r\ntransitions, rising by degrees from one organic form to another. Most of\r\nthe animals hitherto described are immovably fixed to some solid object;\r\nat least, such is their condition in the adult state. We are about to\r\ndescribe zoophytes free of all fetters; animals \"which walk in their\r\nstrength and liberty.\"\r\n\r\nBetween zoophytes fixed to the soil, like the corals, gorgons, and\r\naggregate zoophytes, such as sea-urchins and holothurias, Nature has\r\nplaced an intermediate race, namely, the Crinoïdea, a class of zoophytes\r\nwhich are attached to a rock by a sort of root armed with claws, having\r\na long flexible stem, which enables them to execute movements in the\r\ncircle limited only by the length of this stem, just as the ox or goat\r\nin our paddocks is confined by its tether to the space circumscribed by\r\nthe length of its rope.\r\n\r\nLet the reader picture to himself a star-fish borne upon the summit of a\r\nflexible stem firmly rooted in the soil, and he has a general idea of\r\nthe zoophytes which compose the order of the Crinoïdea. Naturalists of\r\nthe seventeenth century bestowed the name of _stone lilies_ on these\r\ncurious products. This rather poetical name proves that the conformation\r\nof these creatures had at an early period attracted observation,\r\npresenting the naturalist with the most curious of his lessons. The\r\nencrinites raise, as from the dead, a whole world buried in the abyss of\r\nthe past. At the present time only two genera of these zoophytes exist,\r\nwhilst in the early ages of the world the ocean must have swarmed with\r\nthem. Encrinites abounded in the seas during the transition and\r\nsecondary epoch. It was one of the most numerous of the animal tribes\r\nwhich inhabited the salt waters of the ancient world. In traversing some\r\nparts of France, we tread under our feet myriads of these beings, whose\r\ncalcareous remains form vast beds of rock. The encrinites gradually\r\ndisappeared from the ancient seas; their species were diminished as the\r\nglobe became older or modified in its conditions, so that at the present\r\ntime only a few types remain in our seas--such as the _Comatula_ of the\r\nMediterranean; _Pentacrinus_, the Medusa's-head of the Antilles; and the\r\nEuropean _Pentacrinus_--all of them very rare, and probably destined\r\nsoon to disappear, carrying with them the last reminiscence of the\r\nzoological races of the ancient world: and here lies the real interest\r\nwhich the Crinoïdea presents to the thinking man. The encrinites most\r\ncommon in the fossil state are _Pentacrinus fasciculosus_, belonging to\r\nthe lias; _Apiocrinus rotundus_, which is found in the oolite or\r\njurassic rocks; and _Encrinus liliformis_, which appertains to the\r\nTriassic period. These three fixed zoophytes seem to have existed in\r\ngreat numbers during an early age of the world--namely, the Silurian\r\nperiod. They attained their maximum of development during the Devonian\r\nage, after which they begin to decrease. According to M. D'Orbigny,\r\nthere are thirty-nine genera found in the palæozoic rocks, two in the\r\ntriassic, seven in the jurassic, five in the cretaceous, and only one in\r\nthe tertiary strata. Of all these genera only one, namely,\r\n_Pentacrinus_, is found in the modern epoch to represent the varied\r\nforms of these the first inhabitants of the seas.\r\n\r\nThe free Crinoïdæ, that is, those not rooted to the soil by a stem, of\r\nwhich the _Comatula_ may be considered the type, only appeared at a\r\nlater period. They are absent in the palæozoic and triassic rocks, but\r\nappear to have attained their maximum of development in the jurassic\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe numerous fossilized remains of these curious creations, which abound\r\nin different rocks, attracted the attention of learned men at an early\r\nperiod. The encrinites were among the earliest objects of scientific\r\ndescription. As early as the sixteenth century, the celebrated\r\nmineralogist, George Agricola, mentions them under the names of\r\n_Entrochites_, _Trochites_, and _Astroïtes_. At the same time, and\r\nsince that epoch, the Crinoïdæ, which we know by the name of\r\nstone-lilies, and which characterises the _Muschelkalk_ rocks, have been\r\nknown under the name of Encrinus, from εν, stone, and κρίνον, a\r\nlily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107. Pentacrinus caput Medusæ (Müller).]\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century the works upon the Crinoïdæ were very\r\nnumerous, though not very correct. They sometimes reported these organic\r\nremains to be vegetable; sometimes they were beings allied to the\r\nstar-fishes; at others they were the vertebral column of fishes. Towards\r\nthe year 1761, however, Guettard, one of the most learned naturalists of\r\nhis time, understood the real nature of these productions. He had\r\noccasion to examine a recent Encrinus sent from Martinique under the\r\nname of _Sea-Palm_, which was in reality _Pentacrinus caput Medusæ_. The\r\ncomparison of the living individual with the fossil fragment described\r\nby his predecessors, and of which he had specimens in his collections,\r\nenabled him to ascertain the real origin of the fossil Encrinoidæ. The\r\nbeautiful fragment which still exists in the Museum of Natural History\r\nat Paris was long considered unique, but it is now known that ten others\r\nexist in different museums. Since that date the Crinoïdæ have been\r\nexamined and described by observers such as Miller, Forbes, D'Orbigny,\r\nand Pictet, and very elaborately by Major Austin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108. Pentacrinus Europæus (Thompson).]\r\n\r\n\"The species of fixed Crinoïdæ actually living are _Pentacrinus caput_\r\n_Medusæ_ (Fig. 107), and _Pentacrinus Europæus_ (Fig. 108). These\r\ncurious zoophytes resemble a flower borne upon a stem, which terminates\r\nin an organ called the calyx, but which is, properly speaking, the head\r\nof the animal. Arms, more or less branching, spring from this calyx,\r\ntheir ramifications, so formed, consisting of many pieces articulated to\r\neach other. The calyx is supported by a stem, varying in height, formed\r\nof pieces secreted by the living tissues which surround them. The\r\narticulations of this stem are usually very numerous, cylindrical, and\r\npresent a series of rays striated upon their articulated faces. In\r\n_Pentacrinus_ they are prismatic and pentagonal; that is, they present\r\nfive projecting angles, and on their articulated face a star with five\r\nbranches, or, better still, a rose with five petals. At the base of the\r\nstem of this animal-plant, in many of the Crinoïdæ, we find a sort of\r\nspreading root, which is implanted in the rocks, and is capable of\r\ngrowing by itself, of nourishing the stem, and of producing new ones.\r\n\r\nThe root and stem of the fixed encrinites seem to indicate that the\r\nanimal can only live with the head erect. Their normal condition is thus\r\nquite different from that of any other of the Echinoderms, almost all of\r\nwhich keep their mouths invariably directed downwards.\r\n\r\nThe Medusæ heads are chiefly found on rocky beds, or in the midst of\r\nbanks of corals, at great depths. There, firmly fixed by their roots,\r\ntheir long stems raise themselves vertically; then, with expanded calyx\r\nand long-spreading arms, they wait for the prey which passes within\r\ntheir reach in order to seize it.\r\n\r\nThe _Pentacrinus caput Medusæ_ have, as we have said, been fished up\r\nfrom great depths in the Antilles. Its very small calyx is borne upon a\r\nstem of from eighteen to twenty inches in height, terminating in long\r\nmovable arms, the internal surface of which bears its tentacles in a\r\ngroove. In the middle of the arms is a mouth, and at the side the\r\norifice for the expulsion of the digested residuum.\r\n\r\nIn the Medusæ head and European Pentacrine (_P. Europæus_, Fig. 108),\r\nthe presence of a digestive apparatus has been distinctly traced. It is\r\na sort of irregular sac, with a central mouth on the upper surface, and\r\nanother orifice situated at a little distance from the mouth, and\r\nevidently intended as an outlet for the products of digestion. The arms\r\nof these creatures, which are spreading or folded up according to their\r\nwants, are provided with fleshy tentacula, which, serving at once as\r\norgans of absorption and as vibratile cilia, are at the same time organs\r\nof respiration. Such are these curious beings: they occupy a sort of\r\nmiddle or transition state between animals permanently fixed to some\r\nspot and those capable of motion, representing in our own times the last\r\nremains of extinct generations. Every type of the Crinoïdæ furnished\r\nwith arms presents incontestable evidence of their mode of reproduction\r\nor redintegration--that is, of the power of restoring those parts of the\r\nbody broken or destroyed by accident; but as we have already drawn the\r\nattention of the reader to this strange faculty of renewing organs\r\nwhich many of the zoophytes possess, we will not here enlarge further\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Crinoïdæ are not all like the two species which have been described.\r\nThere is an entire family of animals belonging to this class, namely,\r\nthe _Comatula_, which are fixed in their early days, but separate\r\nthemselves from the rooted stem in their adult age, and, throwing off\r\nthe bonds imposed on their youth, live side by side with the asterias,\r\nwith whose company they seem much pleased. The encrinites and the\r\nstar-fishes thus live in company, and that at prodigious depths, and\r\nunder a body of water which no light can reach. Imagine the existence of\r\nanimals which pass their lives in such eternal funereal darkness. The\r\nfamily of Comatula are found in the seas of both hemispheres. Their\r\nbodies are flat--a large calcareous plate formed like a cuirass upon\r\ntheir backs--presenting, besides, cirri composed of numerous curling\r\narticulations, the last of which terminates in a hook. The ventral\r\nsurface presents two orifices: the one in the centre corresponding to a\r\nmouth, the other evidently intended for the discharge of the products of\r\ndigestion. This animal is provided with five arms, which diverge\r\ndirectly from the centre plate or cuirass. The branches of these arms\r\nhave _ambulacral grooves_, comprehending a double row of fleshy\r\ntentacles, in the centre of which is the ambulacral groove, properly so\r\ncalled, clothed with vibratile cilia over their whole surface. These\r\ncilia or hairs guide the current which drives the various substances on\r\nwhich it feeds, such as the organic corpuscles of sea-weeds, and\r\nmicroscopic animalcules floating in the sea, towards its mouth. They are\r\nalso powerful aids to respiration.\r\n\r\nThe movements of these curious creatures are very slow, their only\r\nobject being to catch the bodies of animals and marine plants, or, by\r\nextending or contracting their arms, to feel their way through the water\r\nto some new locality. Sometimes, also, in order to change their\r\nfeeding-ground, the Comatula abandon the submarine forests, herbage, and\r\nsea-wracks, and float through the water, moving their arms with\r\nconsiderable rapidity in search of a new station.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean Comatula (Fig. 109) is largely diffused on the\r\nEuropean shores of the Mediterranean. Its spreading arms extend to three\r\nor four inches; its colour purple, shaded, and spotted with white upon\r\nthe ventral surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109. Comatula Mediterranea (Lamarck), natural size.]\r\n\r\nWere a traveller to tell us that he had seen animals drop their eggs\r\nupon forests of stone; that these eggs, after executing their\r\nprogressive evolutions, finally become individuals in all respects like\r\ntheir parents, which attach themselves to the soil by a root like any\r\nflower of the fields, or to the mother-stem like the branch of a tree,\r\nuntil in due course they attained the adult state, when the flexible\r\nband which holds them fixed either to the soil or parent-stem breaks,\r\nand the animal, now free, launches itself into the liquid medium, and\r\ngoes to live a proper and independent existence;--in listening to a\r\nrecital so opposed in appearance to the ordinary laws of Nature, we\r\nshould be inclined to tax the narrator of such incredible facts with\r\nerror or folly. Nevertheless all these facts are now perfectly\r\nestablished. The being which presents these marvels has nothing of the\r\nfabulous about it. It is the _Comatula Mediterranea_; it lives at the\r\nbottom of the sea, the surface of which is incessantly tracked by our\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPHIURADÆ.\r\n\r\nThe Ophiuras are thus named from two Greek words (ὅϕις, a serpent, and\r\nοὑρὰ, a tail), from their fancied resemblance to the tail of a\r\nserpent. These zoophytes are met with in almost every sea, but chiefly\r\nin those of temperate regions; they are very common on every shore,\r\nand have been remarked by fishermen from the earliest times on account\r\nof their singular form, the disposition of their arms, which resemble\r\nthe tail of a lizard, and by the singularity of their movements. The\r\ngeneral characteristics of this remarkable group of Echinodermata, as\r\ndescribed by Dujardin and Hupé, are as follows. They are radiary marine\r\nanimals creeping at the bottom of the sea, or upon marine plants. In\r\nform they present a sort of coriaceous disk, which is either bare or\r\ncovered with scales, which contains all the viscera, and five very\r\nflexible simple or branching arms, each sustained by a series of\r\nvertebral internal pieces, naked or covered with granules, scales, or\r\nbristles. Certain fleshy tentacula thrown out laterally are organs of\r\nrespiration. The mouth is situated in the middle of the lower surface\r\nof the disk, and opens directly into a stomach in the shape of a sac;\r\nit is circumscribed by five re-entering angles corresponding with the\r\nintervals of the arms, having a series of calcareous pieces, which\r\nperform the function of jaw-bones. This mouth is prolonged by five\r\nlongitudinal clefts, garnished with papillæ or calcareous pieces, which\r\ncorrespond to one of the arms. A series of calcareous pieces in the\r\nshape of vertebræ spring from the extremity of each of these clefts,\r\nwhich occupy all the interior of the arms, having a furrow in the\r\nmiddle of the ventral surface for the reception of a nursing vessel;\r\nand laterally between their expansions are certain cavities, from\r\nwhence issue certain fleshy retractile tentacula; the visceral cavity\r\nopens by one or two clefts on the ventral surface of each side of the\r\nbase of the arms.\r\n\r\nThe Ophiuradæ move themselves by briskly contracting their arms so as to\r\nproduce a succession of undulations analogous to those by which a\r\nserpent creeps along. Some of these zoophytes are rather active; but\r\nothers attach themselves by their arms to the branches of certain other\r\npolyps, like the Gorgons, and remain immovable for a considerable time,\r\nwaiting their prey somewhat like a spider in the midst of his web.\r\n\r\nThe family of Ophiuradæ is divided into two great sections: that of the\r\nOphiura, which comprehends several genera, amongst others that which\r\ngives its name to the family, and that of the Euryalina or Asterophytes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110. Ophiocoma Russei (Lutken), natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe family of Ophiuradæ constitute a group distinguished by their five\r\nsimple, articulated, very mobile, and non-ramified arms, which are\r\nattached to a small disk or shield plate, with flexible thread-like\r\ncirri between the rays. _Ophiura natta_ is very common, and has been\r\nknown from very early times in European seas. It is of a greenish\r\ncolour, with transverse bands, which become more obscure upon the arms\r\nas the distance from the disk increases. This disk is from six to\r\nseven-eighths of an inch in size, the upper part covered with unequal\r\nplates, in shape like tiles; the arms are four times the length of the\r\ndiameter of the disk, very slender and tapering. The zoophyte to which\r\nLamarck gave the name of _Ophiura fragile_ has now its place among the\r\nOphisthrix, the specific name, indicating a particularity of structure\r\nin all these small creatures derived from their fragile formation. In\r\nshort, these beings have so little consistency that they crumble, as it\r\nwere, under the touch, and become reduced to pulp under the slightest\r\npressure. In Fig. 110 we give the representation of an Ophiura of the\r\nnatural size, which Lutken has since called _Ophiocoma Russei_. This\r\nEchinoderm, which lives in the seas of the Antilles, is furnished with\r\nfive very flexible rays, which are armed with from three to four rows of\r\nspines, those on the upper part of the body being very hard ones; the\r\nbody and arms of this creature are of reddish brown, streaked with a\r\ngreat number of little white lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111. Asterophyton verrucosum (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe principal type of the Euryalina is the curious and complex\r\n_Asterophyton verrucosum_ of Lamarck. They include animals remarkable\r\nfor the extremely complicated development of their arms--the very\r\nmultiplied ramifications of these, towards the extremities, being\r\ndivided into many thousand very slender appendages, the principal use of\r\nwhich is doubtless locomotion, but at the same time they constitute a\r\nseries of living thread-like fillets which seem intended to seize and\r\nclose upon the animals which serve as prey to this little flesh-eater.\r\nThe _Asterophyton verrucosum_, which is represented in Fig. 111, is\r\nyellowish; its disk about four inches, its arms sixteen to eighteen. It\r\ninhabits the Indian Ocean. Another species, _Euryala arborescens_, is\r\nmet with on the coasts of Sicily and other parts of the Mediterranean.\r\nNothing can be more elegant than these animated disks, which resemble\r\nnothing so much as a delicate piece of lace--a piece of living lace\r\nmoving in delicate festoons in the bosom of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nECHINIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe singular shape of the Echinidæ, or Sea-urchins, and the spiny\r\nprolongations with which their bodies are covered, has in all ages\r\nattracted the attention of naturalists. Aristotle applied to them the\r\nname ἐχῖνοϛ, which signifies urchin. When, however, one sees the\r\nbody of one of these animals thrown on the sea shore, it is difficult,\r\nat first, to find a reason for this designation. The body of the\r\nsea-urchin is furnished with a species of spine. It is a sort of shell,\r\nnearly spherical, empty in the interior, its surface presenting reliefs\r\nadmirable for their regularity--an egg-shell sculptured by Divine\r\nhands. In order to see the urchin with its spines, it is necessary to\r\nseize it in the water at the bottom of the sea, where it rolls and\r\nmoves its little prickly mass; it is then only that the real urchin,\r\nthe prickly sea-urchin, is to be seen, bristling with prickles, and\r\nstrongly resembling, to compare the physical with the mental, those\r\namiable mortals whose character is so well depicted in the saying,\r\n\"Whom they rub they prick.\"\r\n\r\nIn his book on \"The Sea,\" Michelet puts the following conversation into\r\nthe mouth of a sea-urchin:\r\n\r\n\"I am born without ambition,\" says the modest Echinoderm. \"I ask for\r\nnone of the brilliant gifts possessed by those gentlemen the molluscs. I\r\nwould neither make mother-of-pearl nor pearls; I have no wish for\r\nbrilliant colours, a luxury which would point me out; still less do I\r\ndesire the grace of your giddy Medusas, the waving charm of whose\r\nflaming locks attracts observation and exposes one to shipwreck. Oh\r\nmother! I wish for one thing only: _to be_--to be without these exterior\r\nand compromising appendages; to be thick-set, strong, and round, for\r\nthat is the shape in which I should be the least exposed; in short, to\r\nbe a centralized being. I have very little instinct for travel. To roll\r\nsometimes from the surface to the bottom of the sea is enough of travel\r\nfor me. Glued firmly to my rock, I could there solve the problem, the\r\nsolution of which your future favourite, man, seeks for in vain--that of\r\nsafety. To strictly exclude enemies and admit all friends, especially\r\nwater, air, and light, would, I know, cost me some labour and constant\r\neffort. Covered with movable spines, enemies will avoid me. Now,\r\nbristling like a bear, they call me an urchin.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112. Echinus mamillatus (Lamarck), natural size.]\r\n\r\nLet us now look a little more closely at the general structure of the\r\nsea-urchins--in zoological language, Echinidæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113. Echinus mamillatus. Sea Urchin, without spines,\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nThe body of the sea-urchin is globular in form, slightly egg-shaped, or\r\nof a disk slightly swollen. It consists essentially of an exterior shell\r\nor solid carapace, clothed in a slight membrane furnished with vibratile\r\ncilia. This carapace is formed of an assemblage of contiguous polygonal\r\nplates, adhering together by their edges. Their arrangement is such that\r\nthe test or shell may be divided into vertical zones, each springing\r\nfrom a central point on the summit terminating at a point of the\r\nspheroid diametrically opposite--namely, the circumference of the buccal\r\norifice. These vertical zones are of two kinds, some larger and others\r\nstraighter, each zone consisting of a double row of plates, the first\r\ncharged with movable spines, the second pierced with holes disposed in\r\nregular longitudinal series, from which emerge certain fleshy tentacula,\r\nwhich, as we shall see presently, serve as feet to the animal. When\r\narmed with these bristling spines, the sea-urchins resemble the\r\nhedgehogs; but when the spines are down, they look very much like a\r\nmelon or an egg, to which their shape and calcareous nature have\r\nsometimes led to their being compared by the vulgar as well as by the\r\nlearned. We shall give a tolerably exact idea of the two different\r\naspects which the carapace of the urchin presents when the spines are\r\nerect and lowered, by reference to Fig. 112 (_Echinus mamillatus_),\r\nwhich represents the animal bristling with spines, and Fig. 113, in\r\nwhich the same species is represented after death, when deprived of\r\nthese weapons of defence: and how complicated these defences must be! It\r\nhas been calculated that more than ten thousand pieces, each admirably\r\narranged and united, enter into the composition of the shell of the\r\nsea-urchin, to which no other can be compared. To abbreviate slightly\r\nGosse's description of that wonderful piece of mechanism, the\r\nsea-urchin: \"A globular hollow box has to be made, of some three inches\r\nin diameter, the walls of which shall be scarcely thicker than a wafer,\r\nformed of unyielding limestone, yet fitted to hold the soft tender parts\r\nof an animal which quite fills the cavity at all ages. But in infancy\r\nthe animal is not so big as a pea, and it has to attain its adult\r\ndimensions. The box is never to be cast off or renewed; the same box\r\nmust hold the infant and veteran urchin. The limestone can only increase\r\nin size by being deposited. Now the vascular tissues are within, and the\r\nparticles they deposit must be on the interior walls. To thicken the\r\nwalls from within leaves less room in the cavity; but what is wanted is\r\n_more_ room, ever more and more. The growing animal feels its tissues\r\nswelling day by day, by the assimilation of food. Its cry is, 'Give me\r\nspace! a larger house, or I die!' How is this problem solved? Ah! there\r\nis no difficulty. The inexhaustible wisdom of the Creator has a\r\nbeautiful contrivance for the emergency. The box is not made in one\r\npiece, nor in ten, nor a hundred. Six hundred distinct pieces go to make\r\nup the hollow case; all accurately fitted together, so that the perfect\r\nsymmetry of the outline remains unbroken; and yet, thin as their\r\nsubstance is, they retain their relative positions with unchanging\r\nexactness, and the slight brittle box retains all requisite strength and\r\nfirmness, for each of these pieces is enveloped by a layer of living\r\nflesh; a vascular tissue passes up between the joints, where one meets\r\nanother, and spreads itself over the whole exterior surface.\"\r\n\r\nThis being so, the glands of the investing tissue secrete lime from the\r\nsea water, and deposit it after a determinate and orderly pattern on\r\nevery part of the surface. Thus the inner face, the outer face, and each\r\nside and angle of polyhedron, grow together, and the form characteristic\r\nof the individual is maintained with immutable mathematical precision.\r\nThe dimensions and shape of these prickles are very variable. In certain\r\nEchinidæ they are three or four times the diameter of the body. In the\r\nurchin, properly so called, they are only three-fourths or four-fifths\r\nthat diameter. They sometimes resemble short bristles. These defensive\r\nweapons have tubercles for supports, which are arranged on the surface\r\nof the animal with perfect regularity. At the base they present a small\r\nhead separated by compression. This head is hollow on its lower face,\r\npresenting a cavity adapted to a tubercle of the shell. Each of the\r\nprickles, notwithstanding its extreme minuteness, is put in action by a\r\nmuscular apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114. Echinus esculentus (Lamarck), natural size.]\r\n\r\nIn the prickles, or spines and tentacula (ambulacra, _feet suckers_), we\r\nsee the external organs of the Echinodermata. The former are instruments\r\nof defence and progression; the latter, strange as it may appear, serve\r\nthem to walk with. When it is considered that each of these prickles is\r\nput in motion by several muscles, it is impossible to repress our\r\nwonder and surprise at the prodigious number of organs brought into\r\naction in the sea-urchin. More than twelve hundred prickles have been\r\ncounted upon the shell of _Echinus esculentus_, a representation of\r\nwhich is given in Fig. 114. If we add to this first supply of spines\r\nother smaller and in some sort accessary spines, we shall arrive at a\r\ntotal of three thousand prickles. Each sea urchin thus bears as many\r\nweapons as ten squadrons of lancers. When it is considered, further,\r\nthat in each sucker or ambulacra there exist not less than a hundred\r\ntubes, each having an orifice, you will have a total of four thousand\r\nvisible appendages upon the body of an animal of very small dimensions.\r\nIf it is considered, finally, that no shell exists more admirably\r\nsymmetrical, elegant, or more highly ornamental than the carapace of the\r\nurchin, it will readily be admitted that Nature has been most prodigal\r\nin her gifts to one of the humblest beings in creation--a creature which\r\npasses its existence in crawling in obscurity at the bottom of the sea.\r\nWhat elegance of form, eternally hidden from the eyes of man, sleeps\r\nunder the heavy mass of water; and yet man imagines that everything in\r\nNature has been created for his use and for his glory.\r\n\r\nM. Hupé records a somewhat curious observation in connection with the\r\nspines, which serve as a means of defence to the Echinodermata. He found\r\na small mollusc, of the genus _Stelifera_, which had sought shelter in\r\n_Leixidaris imperialis_, an urchin, native of Australia; in a word, the\r\ninterior of one of these prickles had been hollowed and enlarged so as\r\nto serve as a retreat for this improvised guest.\r\n\r\nWhat unexpected facts does the study of animals present! Nature has\r\nbestowed a protecting armour upon one little being; another still\r\nsmaller animal discovers this, and places itself for shelter under the\r\nprotection of these levelled bayonets! Numerous anecdotes are told of\r\nthem. Thus: a man ignorantly put into his mouth one of these creatures,\r\nwith all its prickles, and, being detected, thought himself, in his\r\npride, compelled to swallow it because he was being looked at;\r\nimmediately his mouth was full of blood. The next day he was in such a\r\nstate of suffering that he could neither eat nor drink, and for a long\r\ntime his life could only be preserved by nourishing injections of soup,\r\ncream, and rice.\r\n\r\nNow let us see by what organic mechanism the urchin contrives to\r\ntransport itself and walk. The tentacula, or suckers, are hollow\r\ninternally, and, as we have said, are provided with small muscles. By\r\nthe influx of liquid which they inclose they become inflated throughout\r\nall their prickles, in such a manner that they can attach themselves to\r\nany solid body, at the will of the animal, by means of their terminal\r\nsuckers. Frédol, in \"Le Monde de les Mers,\" thus explains the urchin's\r\nmode of progression. \"Let us imagine,\" he says, \"one of these creatures\r\nto be at rest; all its spines are immovable, and all its filaments\r\nrepose within the shell; some of these involuntarily escape; they extend\r\nthemselves and feel the ground all round them: others follow, but the\r\nanimal is firmly fixed. If it wishes for change of place, the anterior\r\nfilaments contract themselves, whilst the hinder ones loosen their hold,\r\nand the shell is carried forward. The sea-urchin can thus advance with\r\nease, and even rapidity. During his progression the suckers are only\r\nslightly aided by the spines. It can travel either on the back or\r\nstomach; whatever their posture, they have always a certain number of\r\nprickles, which carry them, and suckers, with which they attach\r\nthemselves. In certain circumstances the animal walks by turning upon\r\nitself, like a wheel in motion.\"\r\n\r\nNothing is more curious than to see a sea-urchin walk upon smooth sand.\r\nBut for the colour, it might be mistaken for a chestnut with its\r\nbristling envelopes, the spines serving as feet to put the little round\r\nprickly mass in motion. They have even been observed to form themselves\r\ninto a ball, and roll along like a globular fagot of prickles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115. Buccal armature of Echinus lividus.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular organs of the sea-urchin is its mouth. It is\r\nmonstrous. Placed underneath the body it occupies the centre of a soft\r\nspace invested with a thick resisting membrane: it opens and shuts\r\nincessantly, showing five sharp teeth (Fig. 115) projecting from the\r\nsurface, the edges meeting at a point, as represented here, supported\r\nand protected by a very complicated framework, which has received the\r\nname of Aristotle's Lantern (Fig. 116). Fig. 115 represents _Echinus\r\nlividus_ in its normal state; the other shows the masticatory organs,\r\nthat is to say, Aristotle's Lantern. To give the reader a more complete\r\nidea of the buccal organ in the sea-urchin, let him glance at one from\r\nthe southern seas, _Clypeaster rosaceus_, represented in Fig. 117, an\r\noutline of the entire animal, the buccal apparatus being placed under\r\nthe shell, which has been broken in Fig. 116, so as to lay this organ\r\nbare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116. Masticating apparatus of Echinus lividus.]\r\n\r\nThe shape of the _Clypeaster rosaceus_ is oval, straighter in front, and\r\nthick and rounded at the edges. It is more common and more largely\r\ndistributed than any other living species, and it is supplied with four\r\nor six ambulacra, or feet.\r\n\r\nI never could understand why the dental framework of the sea-urchin has\r\nbeen called Aristotle's Lantern, for this formidable apparatus resembles\r\nthe front view of a battery of cannon more than a lantern. It consists\r\nof a series of pieces designated by the names of compass, scythe,\r\npyramid, and plumula, which it would serve no useful purpose to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117. Clypeaster rosaceus (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nWe have said that the mouth of the urchin is monstrous in proportion to\r\nits size, and the teeth of proportionate dimensions. As these project\r\nfrom a very formidable mouth, one can easily be assured of the sharpness\r\nof their extremities by intruding his fingers on them. In fact, it is\r\nnecessary that these organs should be singularly powerful, because, as\r\nwe shall see farther on, the sea-urchin makes incisions in the solid\r\nrock with them, and hollows out shelter for himself. The strong and\r\nsharp teeth grow at the base in proportion as they are used at the\r\npoints, as is the case with some of the rodent mammalia. By this means\r\nthey are always sharp and in good condition. Five groups of powerful\r\nmuscles are used to work these terrible grinders.\r\n\r\nTo this formidable mouth is attached an œsophagus or gullet, and an\r\nintestine which extends along the interior walls of the carapace,\r\ndescribing the circumference of its principal contour.\r\n\r\nThe regimen of the Echinidæ is still imperfectly known; nevertheless,\r\nfrom the presence of shells, fragments of corals, crustaceans, and even\r\nother Echinodermata in their intestinal tube, it is to be inferred that\r\na certain number of them at least are carnassiers, or flesh-eaters,\r\nwhile others are supposed on the same evidence to be vegetarians. The\r\norgans of respiration of the Echinidæ appear to be certain flattened\r\nvesicles in the form of very delicate laminæ, which adhere to the\r\ninternal surface of the walls of the body, and float freely in the\r\nliquid with which the visceral cavity is filled. These organs, known as\r\nthe internal _branchiæ_, are in communication with the central canal and\r\nambulacral tubes. The heart is spindle-shaped, tapering above, swelling\r\nbelow. There are two distinct vascular systems, one intestinal, the\r\nother cutaneous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118. Skeleton and Masticating Apparatus.]\r\n\r\nTheir nervous system consists of a ring, which surrounds the gullet, and\r\nis placed at a short distance from the mouth. In this ring the nervous\r\ntrunks have their origin. In relation to the senses, that of touch is\r\nhighly developed. Certain branching tentacula, which surround the mouth,\r\nfashioned like nippers, and the ambulacral tentacles, are its principal\r\norgans. They appear to be altogether destitute of organs of sight. It\r\nhas sometimes been argued that four or five red points at the summit of\r\nthe dorsal face are eyes; but this opinion has not been maintained, nor\r\nhas any crystalline lens been found in these spots to justify it.\r\nCaptain de Condé states that he examined a sea-urchin with long spears\r\nin a pool of water, which he tried to catch, when he saw it direct its\r\nflight towards his hand, all its defences being erect. Surprised at this\r\nmanœuvre, he tried to seize it from another quarter; its spines were\r\ninstantly directed to the other side. \"I have thought from that time\r\nthat the urchin saw me, and prepared to resist my attack. In order,\r\nhowever, to satisfy myself whether or not the movement in the water\r\ncaused by my approach might have produced the effect described, I\r\nrepeated the experiment with greater caution. But the creature always\r\ndirected its spines in the direction of the object which threatened it,\r\nwhether it was in the water or out of it.\" He satisfied himself that\r\nthese animals certainly could see, and that their spines served them as\r\na means of defence.\r\n\r\nThese wonderful spines, this calcareous envelope, this armour so\r\nmarvellously studded, with which nature has so bountifully provided the\r\nEchinidæ, appear to have been insufficient, inasmuch as these very\r\nspines, in order to secure the safety of the animal, are gifted with the\r\npower of hollowing a dwelling for themselves out of solid rocks of the\r\nhardest material, such as granite and sandstone. They fix themselves to\r\nits surface by means of their tentacles; they make an incision by means\r\nof their strong teeth, removing the débris with their spines as fast as\r\nit is produced. When the hole is large enough, they entrench themselves\r\nin it, with their spines and their threatening pikes levelled to protect\r\nthem from all external assaults. To M. Caillaud, the conservator of the\r\nmuseum of Nantes, we are indebted for an excellent account of the manner\r\nin which this buccal apparatus is made to operate. \"The Lantern of\r\nAristotle,\" says this author, \"forms the mandibullary apparatus; the\r\nteeth are five in number, and they may as well receive the denomination\r\nof a series of saws and picks as of teeth, for they are surprisingly\r\nadapted to the excavation of holes in the hardest rock. These five picks\r\nare about the eighth of an inch long, and they serve the sea-urchin at\r\nonce as masticators and excavating implements. In opening the jaws,\r\nthese five teeth strike the stone forcibly rather than scrape it.\" This\r\nproperty of hollowing their dwelling out of the solid rock appears,\r\nhowever, to belong to only a small number of the Echinidæ; most of them\r\nare content to hide themselves under the stones, while the species\r\nhaving the spines slender and the shell very thin bury themselves in the\r\nsand, with which they cover themselves entirely, leaving only a small\r\nhole to breathe through. The _Spatangus_, which is furnished with short\r\nthick spines on the under part of its body, which spread out at the\r\nextremity like the channel of a spoon, proceeds with its mining\r\noperations as follows, according to Mr. Jonathan Franklin. \"Figure to\r\nyourself, reader, the animal on the sea-shore. He commences his\r\noperations by turning the lower spines in such a manner as to form a\r\nhollow on the sand bank, in which he sinks by his own weight; but as he\r\nsinks, a great number of the spines are brought into action, throwing\r\nup the sand with increased activity, while the sand thrown up, returning\r\nagain, soon covers the body of the worker, and he has soon buried\r\nhimself beneath the surface. In this situation the long hair-like spines\r\nsituated upon the back begin to play their part; they prevent the sand\r\nfrom entirely covering the animal by forming a little round hole,\r\nthrough which water is introduced to the mouth and respiratory organs.\"\r\nThe hiding-place of the sea-urchin is, however, easily detected in the\r\nsand by the hole thus arranged for the respiration of the animal, and\r\nthe fishermen think they can predict storms according to the depth of\r\nthe hole.\r\n\r\nThe Echinidæ are reproduced by eggs, which are red and nearly\r\nmicroscopic. As it issues from the egg the larva has the appearance of a\r\nvery minute fish. It is not at once converted into the perfect animal,\r\nbut undergoes a certain metamorphosis analogous to that of the\r\ncaterpillar into the butterfly. But, as we have already stated in\r\ntreating of the Asteriæ, it produces, at a certain stage, by some sort\r\nof internal process of generation, a sea-urchin, which, being at first\r\nonly an organ of the larva, begins to live an independent life when the\r\nnursing larva has destroyed itself. The manner in which the urchin\r\nunfolds itself at the expense of the larva is quite analogous to that\r\nwhich the asterias present: it is another case of alternate generation,\r\nof which our space does not permit us to give even a general outline.\r\n\r\nSea-urchins are found in every sea; they dwell in sandy bottoms, and\r\nsometimes upon rocky ground. They are caught with wooden pincers when in\r\nshallow water; when found at the water's edge, they may be taken by a\r\ngloved hand.\r\n\r\nThe urchin, like the crab, which it also resembles in taste, becomes red\r\nwhen boiled; only certain species are comestible, however. In Corsica\r\nand Algeria the Melon-shaped Urchin (_Echinus melo_) is much esteemed.\r\nIn Naples and in the French ports of the Channel the _Echinus lividus_\r\nis eaten. In Provence the Common Sea-urchin (_Echinus esculentus_ and\r\n_Echinus granulosus_) are the favourites.\r\n\r\nSea-urchins are eaten raw like oysters. They are cut in four parts, and\r\nthe flesh taken out with a spoon; they are sometimes, but more rarely,\r\ndressed by boiling, and eaten from the shell like an egg, using long\r\nsippets of bread: hence the name of sea-eggs, which they bear in many\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IX.--Sea Urchins lodged in the rocks they have\r\nexcavated.]\r\n\r\nSea-eggs were a choice dish upon the tables of the Greeks and Romans;\r\nthey were then served up with vinegar or hydromel, with the addition of\r\nmint or parsley. When Lentulus feasted the priest of Mars--the Flamen\r\nMartialis--this formed the first dish at supper. Sea-eggs also appeared\r\nat the marriage feast of the goddess Hebe. \"Afterwards,\" says the poet,\r\n\"came crabs and sea-urchins, which do not swim in the sea, but content\r\nthemselves by travelling on the sandy shore.\" For my own part, I have\r\nonly once partaken of sea-urchin, and it appeared to me to be food fit\r\nfor the gods; but perhaps the circumstances sufficiently explain this\r\ndash of culinary enthusiasm. The Reserve Restaurant at Marseilles has\r\nnot always been the vast stone edifice we now behold, backed\r\nmajestically by the mountain, and fronting the sea on the promenade of\r\nthe Corniche du Prado. In 1845 it rose quite at the entrance of the\r\nport, a small glass cage, suspended as it were by a magic thread between\r\nthe heavens and the sea. From this aërial dwelling, overhanging with\r\nunheard-of audacity the waters which surrounded it on all sides, we\r\ngazed on the most wonderful prospect in the world, and reposed ourselves\r\nwhile enjoying this intoxicating scene, during which the ships were\r\ncontinually entering the port, passing under our very feet. It was in\r\nthis enchanted palace that sea-urchins were served up, supported by the\r\ntraditional bouillabaise.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, it appeared to me delicious. Was it the Provençal dish,\r\nthe savoury bouillabaise, which contributed to my appreciation of the\r\nhumble sea-urchin of the Mediterranean? Was not the marvellous view\r\nwhich I enjoyed from the heights of my empyreum of glass the indirect\r\ncause of it? This is a tender and charming problem which I love to leave\r\nfloating in the clouds, half evanescent, of my youthful recollections.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLOTHURIA.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant, like you and I, call the Holothuria the Cornechou, or\r\nSea-cucumber, and perhaps, for two reasons, they are not far wrong. The\r\nterm sea-cucumber expresses with wonderful exactness the shape of the\r\nanimal, and its habitation, the sea; and, again, it would puzzle the\r\nmost learned to explain the word _Holothuria_. The body of this strange\r\ncreature presents the form of an elongated and worm-like cylinder; its\r\ndimensions are so variable that, while some species are only an inch or\r\ntwo in length, others attain thirty and even forty. In general, the skin\r\nof the Holothuria is thick and leathery; it includes muscles, and is\r\narmed occasionally with small projecting hooks or fangs, which enable\r\nthe creature to hang for a few seconds on to foreign bodies. From this\r\ncoriaceous envelope issue tentacular feet analogous to those described\r\nin the sea-urchin and sea-star.\r\n\r\nWhen we open a Holothuria we find nearly the whole internal cavity\r\noccupied with little white tubes. We know that the fabulous cucumber\r\nspoken of in the \"Arabian Nights\" was stuffed with pearls by the\r\ntalking-bird. With our poor animal this, alas! is not so. These are no\r\npearls, but simple prosaical tubes containing the ova. The mouth opens\r\nat the extremity of the body; it forms a sort of funnel, and is\r\nsurrounded, as by a glory, with an elegant circle of tentacula. In the\r\nliving animal, when it feels itself in security, these tentacles expand\r\nthemselves like the corolla of a flower. When the fisherman seizes a\r\nHolothuria in the water this crown of tentacles ceases to appear, for\r\nthe animal has the power of withdrawing it quite suddenly, and now it\r\nresembles nothing so much as a common leech. If, however, it is\r\npreserved in fresh sea-water and left in peace--if we treat it, in\r\nshort, with the regard due to its elegant crown of tentacula--this\r\nelegant ornament will be expanded in all its glory. Immediately below\r\nthe mouth is a muscular pharynx, which is contained in a long intestine,\r\nwith many convolutions, which terminate in the posterior part of the\r\nbody in an orifice whence is thrown from time to time a little jet of\r\nwater. The terminal portion of the intestinal canal in these animals is\r\nenlarged, introducing us to a system of numerous tubes which branch off\r\ninto the visceral cavity, receiving the water from without while\r\nbreathing by its posterior extremity; the animal can at will fill this\r\nreservoir or eject the water, and it is by these alternate movements of\r\naspiration and its reverse that it renews the oxygen necessary for\r\nrespiration. The circulation appears to form a complete circle, there\r\nbeing no heart or central agent; but a ring round the gullet, from which\r\nissue five principal nervous chords, represents the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe Holothurias are of separate sexes, and they differ from the\r\nsea-urchins and asterias in this: that their larvæ are converted bodily\r\ninto a young Holothuria without losing their organs. The bodies of\r\ncertain species are lubricated by an acrid and corrosive liquid: thus\r\n_H. oceania_, described by Lesson, which is about forty inches in\r\nlength, secretes at the surface of its body an irritating fluid, which\r\nproduces an intolerable itching in the finger which touches it. Nor can\r\nthe inhabitants of the South Sea Islands look at it without loathing.\r\nFig. 119 represents _H. lutea_, or the _Stychopus luteus_ of Brandt, who\r\ndescribes as its distinctive character three rows of tentacular feet on\r\nthe ventral surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119. Holothuria lutea (Quoy and Gaimard).]\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the strange suicidal tendency of the sea-stars: the\r\nHolothuria exhibits the same phenomena, but, having no brittle envelope\r\nlike the asterias, it cannot break itself into bits in the presence of\r\nits disconcerted enemy; but kills itself in this manner: having some\r\ncause of grief and trouble--such, for instance, as the attack of an\r\nenemy or the pursuit of some fisherman--by a sudden and unexpected\r\nmovement it ejects its teeth, its stomach, its digestive apparatus, and\r\nreduces itself to a simple empty membranous sac, with an unfurnished\r\nmouth; and, as a singular fact, this empty sac still shrinks and\r\ncontracts in the hand which grasps it. It must be admitted that this is\r\na strange mode of evading its enemies: the soldier rarely throws his\r\narms away in the moment of danger! But the Holothurias possess a\r\nwonderful recuperative power also; and it is probably quite conscious,\r\nwhen it thus empties itself to disappoint its pursuer, that it can\r\npromptly replace the organs which it has voluntarily parted with.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnston relates that he had forgotten for some days to supply a\r\nHolothuria with a change of water. The creature, in consequence, ejected\r\nits tentacles, its buccal apparatus, digestive tubes, and a portion of\r\nits ovaries. Still it was not dead, but was sensible to the least\r\nmovement, and lived to reproduce all its organs anew.\r\n\r\nNot only do the Holothurias eject their organs and afterwards renew\r\nthem, but they divide themselves spontaneously into two portions. Their\r\ntwo extremities are first enlarged; then their middle parts gradually\r\nbecome straight, like a thread: finally, this thread breaks, and each\r\nseparate part of the animal becomes a perfect Holothuria. It has been\r\ncut into two pieces, and each of these species becomes a new being.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate X.--Fishing for and curing the Holothuria in the\r\nIndian Ocean.]\r\n\r\nThe habits of these animals are but little known. They inhabit the seas,\r\nand are spread over every latitude. Their very limited movements consist\r\nin a kind of reptation or crawling motion, produced by the undulations\r\nof their bodies or by the contractions of their feet. Holothurias are\r\ngenerally found in the act of creeping upon stones or on portions of\r\nsubmarine rock, but always in sheltered places, for they appear to dread\r\nthe action of light. They sometimes find themselves caught by fishermen\r\nin their nets. If held in the hand they contract, their bodies become\r\nhard and rigid, and the sea water with which they are filled is ejected\r\nwith force. We need not add that fishermen reject with disdain the\r\nHolothurias taken in their nets; the sea-cucumber has never been thought\r\nworthy of a place on our tables. Truth is on this side, error on that,\r\nis a maxim as true in morals as in cookery. The sea-cucumber, which\r\nEuropeans disdain, is a favourite dish among the Chinese. The fishery,\r\npreparation of, and transport of these animals to market, plays an\r\nimportant part in the commerce and industry of the East. One rather\r\nlarge species, the _Holothuria tubulosa_, in which, by-the-bye, a\r\nsingular parasite fish (_Fierasfer fontanesii_) lives, is common in the\r\nMediterranean. This species is eatable, and much relished at Naples. In\r\nthe Ladrone Islands _Holothuria guamensis_ is preferred. But nowhere is\r\nit esteemed of such importance as in the Malayan and Chinese seas. In\r\nthese countries, and on most of the shores of the Indian Ocean, the\r\n_Holothuria edulis_, vulgarly called _Trepang_, is eaten with delight.\r\nThousands of junks are annually equipped for the Trepang fisheries. The\r\nMalay fishermen carry to this fishery a degree of patience and dexterity\r\ntruly remarkable. Lying down in the fore part of their vessels, and\r\nholding in their hands a long bamboo, terminating in a sharp hook, their\r\neyes, accustomed to this fishing, frequently discover the animal at a\r\ndistance of not less than thirty yards, as it creeps along the surface\r\nof the submarine rocks or corals. The fisher darts his harpoon at this\r\ndistance, and seldom misses his prey. When the water is shallow, that is\r\nto say, not more than four or five fathoms deep, divers are sent down to\r\nobtain these culinary monsters, who seize them in their hands, and in\r\nthis manner can take five or six at a time. To prepare the fish and\r\npreserve them for transport to the markets, the Malay and Chinese\r\nfishermen boil them in water, and flatten them with stones. They are\r\nthen spread out on bamboo mats to dry; first in the sun, and then by\r\nsmoking them. Thus prepared, they are enclosed in sacks, and shipped to\r\nthe Chinese ports, where they are particularly esteemed. This fishery\r\ntakes place in the months of April and May.\r\n\r\nIn his voyage to the South Pole, Captain Dumont d'Urville, in traversing\r\nthe Chinese seas, had an opportunity of assisting at this fishery, which\r\nhe has described very graphically. We quote the passage in which the\r\nFrench navigator relates what he witnessed at this curious scene. While\r\nthe ships were lying quietly at anchor, \"we saw,\" he says, \"entering the\r\nbay, four Malay proas, bearing Dutch colours, which dropped their\r\nanchors about a cable's length from Observatory Islet. The padrones or\r\ncaptains of these vessels soon presented their salutations, and informed\r\nme that they had started from Macassar at the end of October, with the\r\nwestern monsoon, and that they came to fish for Holothuria (trepang)\r\nalong the coasts of New Holland, from Melville Island to the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria, where the east wind met them and assisted their return,\r\nwhen they revisited all the points of the coast, anchoring in every bay\r\nwhere they hoped to find fish. We were in the first days of April; the\r\neast monsoon was definitively established; the Malay fishermen were\r\nreturning in their circuit, and, in passing, they came to exercise their\r\nindustry in Raffles' Bay. An hour after their arrival they were all at\r\nwork, and the laboratory for the preparation of their fish was\r\nestablished within our view. The roadstead had no longer the aspect of a\r\nvast solitude: wreaths of smoke crowned the summit of Observatory\r\nIsland, where, as if by enchantment, several large sheds had sprung up,\r\nwhile numerous vessels, supplied with divers, were proceeding to fish\r\nfor Holothurias, which were passed immediately to the furnaces erected\r\nfor curing them. In the course of my voyage I have often remarked little\r\nwalls constructed of dry stones, consisting of several half-circles\r\njoined one to the other. I had often, but vainly, tried to discover the\r\nuse of these little structures: I was now enlightened. The Malays\r\narrived. Their boats were scarcely anchored when several large boilers,\r\nin the shape of a half-sphere, the diameter of which might be about\r\nforty inches, were placed upon the stone walls of which I have spoken,\r\nand now served as improvised furnaces. Near to them are sheds, composed\r\nof four strong posts driven into the earth, supporting roofing covered\r\nwith hurdles, on which it is probably intended to dry the Holothurias.\r\nDuring their sojourn in this bay, the fishermen, having fine weather,\r\nmade no use of these sheds, having probably only prepared them as a\r\nprecaution.\r\n\r\n\"A crowd of men actively employed in establishing their laboratories\r\ngave an unaccustomed appearance to the bay, which could not fail to\r\nattract the savage inhabitants of the main land. Very soon, indeed, we\r\ncould see them hastening from all sides, and nearly all reached the\r\nlittle island, either by swimming or wading through the sheet of shallow\r\nwater which separates it from the main land. I only saw one pirogue,\r\nmade of the bark of a tree badly put together, which gave a passage to\r\nthree of these visitors. When night arrived, the Malays had finished all\r\ntheir preparations; some of them remained to guard what they had left on\r\nshore, all the others returned to their boats.\r\n\r\n\"In the interval, a boat from the Astrolabe being wanted to carry some\r\nvisitors from the island, I profited by the occasion to visit one of\r\nthe proas, accompanied by M. Roquemauel. We were received with much\r\npoliteness, and even cordiality, by the captain or padrone of the boats.\r\nHe showed us over his little ship. The keel appeared to us sufficiently\r\nsolid; even the lines did not want elegance; but great disorder seemed\r\nto reign in the stowage department. From a kind of bridge, formed by\r\nhurdles of bamboos and junk, we saw the cabin, which looked like a\r\npoultry-house; bags of rice, packets, and boxes were huddled together.\r\nBelow was the store of water, of cured trepang, and the sailors' berths.\r\nEach boat was furnished with two rudders, one at each end, which lifted\r\nitself when the boat touched the bottom. The craft was furnished with\r\ntwo masts, without shrouds, which could be lowered on to the bridge at\r\nwill by means of a hinge; they carry the ordinary sail; the anchors are\r\nof wood, for iron is rarely used by the Malays; their cables are made of\r\nratan fibre; the crew of each bark consists of about thirty-seven, each\r\nshore-boat having a crew of six men. At the moment of our visit they\r\nwere all occupied in fishing operations, some of them being anchored\r\nvery near to us. Seven or eight of their number, nearly naked, were\r\ndiving for trepang; the padrone alone was unoccupied. An ardent sun\r\ndarted his rays upon their heads without appearing to incommode them, an\r\nexposure which no European could hold up under. It was near mid-day, and\r\nthe moment, as our Malay captain assured us, most favourable for the\r\nfishing. In fact, we saw that each diver returned to the surface with at\r\nleast one animal, and sometimes two, in his hands. It appears that the\r\nhigher the sun is above the horizon, the more easily is the creature\r\ndistinguished at the bottom. The divers were so rapid in their\r\nmovements, that they scarcely touched the boat, into which they threw\r\nthe animals, before they dived again. When the boat was filled with\r\nthem, it proceeded to the shore, and its place was supplied by an empty\r\none. I followed one of these, to witness the process of curing which\r\nthey adopted.\r\n\r\n\"The Holothuria of Raffles' Bay is from five to six inches long and\r\nabout two in diameter; it is a gross fleshy mass, somewhat cylindrical\r\nin form, but no external organ is visible. The mollusc glues itself to\r\nthe rocks at the bottom of the sea, and, as it can only move very\r\nslowly, the Malay divers seize it readily. The greatest merit of a\r\nfisherman is to have a practised eye, to distinguish the animal at the\r\nbottom, and to dive directly to the spot where it lies. To preserve\r\nthem, the fishermen throw them, while still living, into a cauldron of\r\nboiling sea water, where they are stirred about by means of a long pole,\r\nwhich is supported upon another pole fixed in the earth, but having a\r\nforked end, which acts as a lever. In this process the trepang gives up\r\nall the water it contains, and is withdrawn at the end of two minutes. A\r\nman armed with a large knife now extracts the entrails, and it is thrown\r\ninto a second cauldron, having only a small quantity of water, seasoned\r\nwith mimosa bark. The object of this second operation is to smoke the\r\nanimal in order to preserve it the better, for the bark is consumed in\r\nthe process. The trepang is now placed upon hurdles and dried in the\r\nsun. When sufficiently dried, it is stowed away in the hold of the proa.\r\n\r\n\"It was about two o'clock in the afternoon when the divers ceased their\r\nlabours and came ashore. My tent was soon surrounded. I recognized the\r\ncaptain of the proa among those who had previously visited me. He\r\napproached and examined all the instruments used in the Observatory with\r\ngreat attention, seeking to discover their use. I showed him a gun with\r\npercussion cap, which astonished him greatly, especially when I pointed\r\nout to him its great superiority over the flint-lock. He assured me that\r\nthese arms were still unknown in the Celebes, his country; but he failed\r\nto convince me of that. He questioned me as to the places we had\r\nvisited, and where we were going. I endeavoured to sketch a map of New\r\nHolland, New Zealand, and New Guinea upon a leaf. He then took my\r\npencil, and added to it the Indian Archipelago, the coasts of China and\r\nJapan, and the Philippine Islands. Surprised in my turn, I asked him if\r\nhe had visited all these places. He replied in the negative; but added\r\nthat he knew their position perfectly, and could easily take his vessel\r\nto any of them. Finally, the interview terminated by his asking for a\r\nglass of arrack. I do not know if this intelligent Malay professed the\r\nMahometan religion, but I do know that he drank half a bottle of wine\r\nand a quarter of a pint of arrack without being at all the worse for it.\r\nHe then offered me some prepared trepang, inviting me to taste it, which\r\nI did; to me it appeared to resemble the lobster in taste. My men liked\r\nit, and thankfully accepted the captain's offer; for my part, I felt an\r\nutter repugnance even to taste it.\r\n\r\n\"According to the account I had from the Malay captain, the price of\r\ntrepang in the Chinese markets was fifteen rupees, about thirty\r\nshillings the pekoul, or a hundred and twenty-five pounds. He\r\nestimated his cargo to be worth about a hundred and twenty pounds. The\r\nfishing had occupied him and his crew three months. From the earliest\r\ntimes this commerce has belonged exclusively to the Malay fishermen, and\r\nit will always be difficult for Europeans to compete with them. The\r\nMalay vessels are equipped on the most economical principle, and the men\r\nare wanting neither in sobriety, intelligence, or activity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XI.--Synapta Duvernæa. (Quatrefages.)]\r\n\r\n\"It was nearly four o'clock when the Malays finished their operations.\r\nIn less than half an hour they had embarked their cargo; the tents were\r\nstruck, and, together with the boilers, carried back to the boats, which\r\nwere already preparing to set sail. At eight o'clock in the evening they\r\nhoisted sail and left the bay.\"\r\n\r\nSome idea may be formed of the extent and importance of the Holothuria\r\nfishing by the number of ships which it attracts in this part of the\r\nEast. Captain King assures us that two hundred vessels annually leave\r\nMadagascar to fish for the _sea slug_, as it is sometimes called.\r\nCaptain Flinders, being on the coast of Australia, learnt that a fleet\r\nof sixty vessels, having a hundred men on board, had left Madagascar two\r\nmonths previously in the same pursuit.\r\n\r\nAmong the Holothurias, one particular genus, the _Synapta_, is\r\ndistinguished from others of the family by the absence of the ambulacral\r\nfeet, and by the fact of its uniting both sexes in one individual. This\r\nremarkable Echinoderm, _Synapta duvernæa_, is represented in PL. XI. M.\r\nQuatrefages, who discovered it in the Channel, gives the following\r\ndescription of it in his great work, \"Le Souvenirs d'un Naturaliste.\"\r\n\"Imagine,\" he says, \"a cylinder of rose-coloured crystal, as much as\r\neighteen inches long and more than an inch in diameter, traversed in all\r\nits length by five narrow ribbons of white silk, and its head surmounted\r\nby a living flower, whose twelve tentacles of purest white fall behind\r\nin a graceful curve. In the centre of these tissues, which rival in\r\ntheir delicacy the most refined products of the loom, imagine an\r\nintestine of the thinnest gauze gorged from one end to the other with\r\ncoarse grains of granite, the rugged points and sharp edge of which are\r\nperfectly perceptible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\n\"But what most struck me at first in this animal was, that it seemed\r\nliterally to have no other nourishment than the coarse sand by which it\r\nwas surrounded. And then when, armed with scalpel and microscope, I\r\nascertained something of its organisation, what unheard-of marvels were\r\nrevealed! In this body, the walls of which scarcely reach the sixteenth\r\npart of an inch in thickness, I could distinguish seven distinct layers\r\nof tissue, with a skin, muscles, and membranes. Upon the petaloid\r\ntentacles I could trace terminal suckers, which enabled the Synapta to\r\ncrawl up the side of a most highly polished vase. In short, this\r\ncreature, denuded to all appearance of every means of attack or defence,\r\nshowed itself to be protected by a species of mosaic, formed of small\r\ncalcareous shield-like defences, bristling with double hooks, the points\r\nof which, dentated like the arrows of the Caribbeans, had taken hold of\r\nmy hands.\"\r\n\r\nIf one of these Synapta is preserved alive in sea-water for a short\r\ntime, and subjected to a forced fast, a very strange phenomenon will be\r\nobserved. The animal, being unable to feed itself, successively detaches\r\nvarious parts of its own body, which it amputates spontaneously. A great\r\ncompression or ring is first formed, and then the separation of the\r\ncondemned part takes place quite suddenly. \"It would appear,\" says M.\r\nQuatrefages, \"that the animal, feeling that it had not sufficient food\r\nto support its whole body, was able successively to abridge its\r\ndimensions, by suppressing the parts which it would be most difficult to\r\nsupport, just as we should dismiss the most useless mouths from a\r\nbesieged city.\"\r\n\r\nThis singular mode of meeting a famine is employed by the Synapta up to\r\nthe last moment. After a few days, in fact, all that remains of the\r\nanimal is a round ball, surmounted by its tentacles. In order to\r\npreserve life in the head, the animal has sacrificed all the other parts\r\nof its body.\r\n\r\nIn order to find natural novelties--to find unforeseen subjects of study\r\nand reflection, it is not necessary to run over the world or travel\r\ngreat distances. It is only necessary to visit the banks of the nearest\r\nriver, or descend to the sea shore, and leave the sea to reveal a\r\nfragment of the marvels which it conceals in its bosom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOLLUSCA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe class Mollusca--pulpy animals--forms a grand division which man has\r\nbeen pleased to make in the animal kingdom, and immediately below the\r\nVertebrata and above the Annulosa, which again stand above the\r\nCoelenterata, which includes the polyps, sea-anemones, hydras, and\r\ncorals, which last are more highly organized than the Protozoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120. P. C. Mollusca.]\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca may be divided into two groups, the Mollusca proper and the\r\nMolluscoïda. The mollusc proper, as represented in Fig. 120, presents\r\nthe following parts, and is supposed to be bilaterally symmetrical, H,\r\nis the hæmal parts, in which the heart is situated, commonly called the\r\ndorsal part, although the word is used in a different sense in different\r\ndivisions of the animal kingdom. In the same manner the opposite region\r\n(N) is not termed the ventral, but the neural part, in philosophical\r\nanatomy. It is the region in which the great centres of the nervous\r\nsystem are placed. The termination (_a_) is the anterior or oval part;\r\nthe other end (_b_), the posterior or anal part: between these\r\nextremities the intestines take a straight course. The neural surface\r\nis that upon which the majority of molluscs move, and by which they are\r\nsupported, and it is commonly modified to subserve these purposes by the\r\nformation of a muscular expansion or disk, called the foot. Three\r\nregions, in many genera very distinctly divided from one another, may be\r\ndistinguished in this foot: an anterior, the _Propodium_ (_p p_); a\r\nmiddle, the _Mesopodium_ (_m s_); and a posterior, the _Metapodium_ (_m\r\nt_). In addition to these, the upper part of the foot, or middle portion\r\nof the body, may be prolonged into a muscular enlargement on each side,\r\njust below the junction of the hæmal with the neural region, the\r\n_Epipodium_ (_e p_). The mass of the body between the foot proper and\r\nthe part of the abdomen which bears the epipodium may be termed the\r\nmid-body, or _Mesosoma_. On the upper part of the sides of the head are\r\ntwo pairs of organs, namely, the eyes and tentacles. In the hæmal region\r\nthe integument may be modified and raised up into a fold at the edges,\r\neither in front or behind the anus. When so modified, it is called a\r\nmantle, _Pallium_. In front of the anus again, the _branchiæ_ (_t_)\r\nproject as processes of the hæmal region. Among the internal organs, the\r\nheart (_u v_) lies in front of the branchiæ in the hæmal regions, the\r\nnervous ganglia (_x_ _y_ _z_), of which there are three principal pairs,\r\nbeing arranged around the alimentary canal, which they encircle.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general type of the class Mollusca, of which, however, the\r\nvariations are innumerable. They are all soft-skinned animals, without\r\neither articulated exterior or annular external skeleton. Their nervous\r\nsystem, being without cerebro-spinal axis, is entirely composed of\r\nganglions, which are all reunited in the oesophagus without constituting\r\nin any case a lengthened median chain. Their digestive organs are\r\ncomplete--that is, they are provided with two apertures; their principal\r\norgans are symmetrical and according to a plan, usually curving, by\r\nwhich their bodies are divided into two parts.\r\n\r\nThe first series or subdivision, to which Milne Edwards has given the\r\nname of _Molluscoïda_, includes under that term the Bryozoaires,\r\nAscidians, and Tunicata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMOLLUSCOÏDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bryozoaires, or Polyzoa, as British naturalists prefer to call them,\r\nform the boundary-line which divides the humble mollusc from the humbler\r\nzoophytes. In consequence of this intermediate organization, these\r\ncreatures were long considered as polyps; but De Blainville, Milne\r\nEdwards, and Ehrenberg, almost simultaneously began to separate them\r\nfrom the molluscs, and form them into a separate group. Subsequent\r\nnaturalists, while considering the Molluscoïda as truly and wholly\r\nmolluscous, admit that the distinction proposed by the French\r\nnaturalists is most important, and should be retained as a primary\r\nsubdivision, confining it to those molluscs which have the neural region\r\ncomparatively little developed, and the nervous system reduced to a\r\nsingle or at most a pair of ganglia, and the mouth surrounded by a more\r\nor less perfect circle of tentacles: an arrangement which would include\r\nthe _Brachiopoda_ with the _Polyzoa_.\r\n\r\nMarine plants are sometimes observed to be quite covered with a velvety\r\nparasitic matter, which may at a first glance be mistaken for a moss.\r\nThis, however, is simply an aggregation of animalcules, each of which\r\nhas its separate cell, which is placed quite contiguous to its\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\nThese little creatures are thus entirely distinct. Each cell is formed\r\nby the skin, which has been encrusted by calcareous salts, or other\r\norganic matter, hardened after the manner of a horn. This kind of shell\r\nprotects the animal from the attacks of its enemies. This mode of\r\nretreat at the bottom of a protecting shelter is very frequently adopted\r\nin the whole series of molluscs. The oyster shuts itself up by closing\r\nits valves, and the snail retires into its shell. This assemblage of\r\nsmall cells presented by the Bryozoaires has long been known as a\r\ncoral. \"We propose,\" says our author, \"with very good reasons, to call\r\nit a _Testier_, or shell-builder.\"\r\n\r\nThis testier, in which each shell has its opening, is furnished with a\r\nnaked cushion, dentate, spinous, or protected by an operculum or lid,\r\nand presents itself under every variety of form. It is sometimes an\r\nassemblage of branching tubes, occasionally a rounded mass of spongy\r\nappearance, and now it presents itself as a flat lamelliform\r\ninarticulated expansion. In some of the marine species the shell of the\r\nmussel is covered as with a fine lace.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that these cells are not always inert. They seem\r\nto enjoy the power of motion. It is well known that the leaves and\r\nbranches of the sensitive plant (_Mimosa_) contract and expand under the\r\ntouch of the finger; the same phenomenon, according to Mr. Rymer Jones,\r\ntakes place on touching the cells of certain species of Bryozoaires. The\r\nmoment they are touched they quickly incline themselves; and the\r\nmovement is immediately communicated from one to the other, until all\r\nthe cells of the community are in motion.\r\n\r\nReturning to the organization of the little creature which occupies the\r\ncell, it is found that the upper and retractile portion, which is of\r\nextreme delicacy, terminates anteriorly in a circle of long tentacles,\r\nin the centre of which is the mouth. These tentacles are fringed\r\nlaterally by a series of vibratile cilia. \"When the animal displays\r\nitself,\" says Frédol, \"this circle of microscopic threads of extreme\r\ntenuity first show themselves rising from the summit of the cell; this\r\nis followed by the upper part of its body, which is more or less\r\nflexible; the tentacles follow between the threads, pushing them on one\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\nThese tentacles are furnished on the back with a dozen appendages like\r\nvery fine hairs, attached to them nearly at right angles, in addition to\r\nthe lateral cilia already spoken of, which play a very important part in\r\nthe arrangements of most microscopic animals. At the moment when the\r\ntentacles appear outside the cell, the tunic of the animalcule, which\r\nhas the power of expanding or contracting itself, is gradually unrolled.\r\nIt soon spreads out its pretty little arms, the appendages and cilia\r\nbeginning their rapid vibrations, until the eye, deceived by the\r\nrapidity and regularity of their movements, is dazzled, and the beholder\r\nbegins to think that he sees rosy drops of dew waving to and fro,\r\ntwisting and untwisting themselves. The corpuscles which float round the\r\nanimal are violently agitated, as if they were under the influence of\r\nsome strong breeze. Unhappy, indeed, is the fate of the unfortunate\r\ninfusoria which chance leads at this moment into the fatal circle.\r\n\r\nIn many species, observers have discovered a special organ called the\r\n_vibracule_, which deserves our attention for a moment. It is a hollow\r\nfilament, situated at the upper and outer angle of each cell, filled\r\nwith a substance which is at once fibrous and contractile, admitting of\r\nsome very remarkable movements, which occur regularly, and generally at\r\nvery short intervals. At first the filament inclines itself towards the\r\nbase, trembles, oscillates, and seems to sink; presently it recovers\r\nitself, and inclines in the opposite direction, where it repeats the\r\nsame operation with the same order and in the same time. \"What are the\r\nfunctions thus performed?\" asks Frédol. \"Are they, we would ask,\r\nindependent up to a certain point of the will of the Bryozoaire? What is\r\ntheir purpose?\" We think he answers, \"That this organ serves the purpose\r\nof cleansing, and especially that of strengthening, the entrance to the\r\ncell. It even continues its movement after the animal has been mutilated\r\nor killed. The poor sickly or dead creature continues to be defended by\r\nits protecting vibracule.\"\r\n\r\nThe prey which is drawn into the vortex by the tentacles and their\r\nappendages enters into the mouth, to which is attached a pharynx,\r\noesophagus, stomach, and intestines. In the back or hæmal region, not\r\nfar from the mouth, there is a special opening for this intestine.\r\n\r\nRespiration is provided for in the Bryozoaires by the ciliate appendages\r\nwhich surround the mouth; they are at once tentacula and branchiæ. The\r\nanimal presents no other trace of organs of the senses. A small ganglion\r\nand a few fillets constitute all of the nervous system which can be\r\ntraced; neither heart nor blood-vessels have been found.\r\n\r\nThe egg, in the case of the Bryozoaires, gives birth to a young animal\r\ncovered with hairs on its surface; it swims about freely until it has\r\nchosen a convenient place in which it can establish the new colony which\r\nit is to originate. But this choice is not made for itself alone; the\r\nyoung animal encloses under its hairy envelope two new individuals,\r\nwhich, young as they are, have already the appearance of adult\r\nBryozoaires. At first, these only increase the number of the colony by\r\nbudding, but in a short time they produce eggs.\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that the animals of the Bryozoaires\r\nare more complex in their form and functions than those of the coral,\r\nand the study of their anatomy confirms this conclusion. In their case\r\nthe digestive organs are no longer a simple sac with a single orifice;\r\nthere is a mouth, a pharynx, a gullet, a gizzard, a membranous stomach\r\nand intestines, with a special opening. We have descriptions of some\r\nspecies in which the gizzard seems to be provided with a certain number\r\nof interior teeth forming a wonderful pavement--a living mill for the\r\npurpose of grinding the food before it enters into the second stomach.\r\nThe organization of this small creature reveals to our eyes a wonderful\r\namount of combination--of admirable art immeasurably surpassing all that\r\nthe most perfect human industry and human genius can accomplish.\r\n\r\nAfter this general view of the organization of the group, we shall\r\nproceed to introduce the reader to some of their more characteristic\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nUnder the leaves of water-lilies (_Nymphea_), pond-weed (_Potamogeton_),\r\nor upon floating fragments of submerged wood, are generally to be found\r\ncertain Bryozoaires, animals described by Trembley under the name of\r\n_plumed polyps_. These are _Plumatellæ_ (Fig. 121). These little\r\ndiaphanous creatures constitute colonies which under the microscope\r\nresemble small branching shrubs; they consist of small slender tubes\r\ngrafted one to the other, and having from forty to sixty retractile\r\ntentacula, which expand like the petals of a flower; they are furnished\r\nwith vibratile cilia, the movements of which serve the purpose of\r\nleading food into the mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121. Plumatella cristallina magnified (after\r\nRoesel).]\r\n\r\nAnother genus, which is found in ponds in France, and which is also\r\nfound in fresh water in Britain, is the _Cristatella_ of Cuvier.\r\n\"Perfect specimens of _C. mucedo_ occur from six lines to twenty-four in\r\nlength by two or three in breadth,\" says Sir J. G. Dalyel, \"of a\r\nflattened figure, fine translucent green colour, and fleshy consistence.\r\nSome of the shorter tend to an elliptical form, but those of larger\r\ndimensions are linear, with parallel sides, and curved extremities. The\r\nmiddle of the upper and the whole of the under surface are smooth, the\r\nformer somewhat convex, occasioned by a border of seventy or eighty,\r\neven up to three hundred and fifty, individual polypi, dispersed in a\r\ntriple row, their number depending entirely on the size of the specimen.\r\nEach of these numerous polypi, though an integral portion of the common\r\nmass, is a distinct animal, endowed with separate action and sensation.\r\nThe body rising about a line above a tubular fleshy stem, is crowned by\r\na head, which may be circumscribed by a circle as much in diameter, of a\r\nhorse-shoe shape, and bordered by a hundred tentacula. Towards one side,\r\nthe mouth, of singular mechanism, seems to have projecting lips and to\r\nopen as a valve, which folds up within, conveying the particles which\r\nare absorbed to the wide orifice of an intestinal organ, which descends,\r\nperhaps, in a convolution below; and returns again, terminating in an\r\nexcretory canal under the site of the tentacula.\"\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the colony are then united in great numbers under one\r\ncommon envelope; these are longish filaments of the size of a swan's\r\nfeather, reminding one of the appearance of the silk thread known by\r\nembroiderers as chenille. The downy appearance is produced by the\r\ncollection of tentacula belonging to this curious swarm. The filamentous\r\nmass is the translucent row of cells in which these animalcules are\r\nlodged, and to which they retreat when disturbed. These cells are\r\nsometimes free in part, sometimes completely rooted to the stems of\r\naquatic plants. The tentacles are of a fine transparent glass colour,\r\nthe body being of a brown colour. Fig. 122 represents _Cristatella\r\nmucedo_, which is common both in this country and in France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122. Cristatella mucedo (Cuvier).]\r\n\r\nMost naturalists have now agreed to place among the Bryozoa certain\r\nspecies of animalcules which long remained imperfectly known. Amongst\r\nthese are the _Flustra_, the _Eschara_, and other ascidians.\r\n\r\nThe Flustra are marine Bryozoa, whose skin in hardening forms a thin\r\nshell of horny or cellular appearance; their little cells, more or less\r\nhorny, are grouped symmetrically, somewhat like the cells in a bee-hive.\r\nSometimes they form a crust which covers the algæ and other submarine\r\nbodies; sometimes they form ribbon-like stems. In some species the cells\r\nare only found on one side; in others they occupy both. Their orifices\r\nare extremely small, and defended by spines quite microscopic (Fig.\r\n123).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123. Flustra foliacea (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nTheir tentacles are covered with cilia, always vibratile, disposed in a\r\nstraight line, which in their movements produce the effect which a row\r\nof animated pearls might be supposed to produce if rolled upwards from\r\nthe base to the summit of the organ.\r\n\r\nThe Eschara form leaf-like expansions, the entrance to their cells\r\nhaving also their protecting spines.\r\n\r\nThe expansions still represent microscopic bee-hives, the inhabitants of\r\nwhich enjoy at once a common and an independent existence. As it is\r\nwith the corals, so it is here; each eats for the benefit of itself and\r\nfor the community. Labour and nutrition for the community, labour and\r\nfood for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUNICATA.\r\n\r\nOn seeing one of the _Tunicata_ for the first time, a stranger to\r\nzoology would scarcely take them for animals at all. Almost always\r\nattached to submarine rocks, these beings have the form of a simple sac.\r\nTheir skin, gelatinous, horny, or rock-like, is at times covered with\r\nmarine plants and polyps. They have neither arms, nor feet, nor head.\r\nBut then they have a mouth, placed at the entrance of a digestive tube,\r\nand, in connection with the latter, a special opening intended for\r\nevacuations. The mouth is preceded by a great cavity, the walls of which\r\nare covered with vessels; for this cavity is the seat of respiration,\r\nand is covered with vibratile cilia. Thus the same canal serves first\r\nfor respiration, and then, farther on, for digestion: another instance\r\nof the economy of Nature. Another remarkable instance of circulation is\r\nfound: they have a heart, but no head.\r\n\r\nThis heart is the centre of a well-developed vascular system, but very\r\nunlike what usually obtains. The blood which traverses it takes such a\r\ncourse, that, in the space of a very few minutes, the heart changes its\r\naurical into ventrical and its ventrical into aurical blood. At the same\r\ntime the arteries are changed into veins and the veins into arteries.\r\nThe consequence is, that the current which traverses these canals\r\nchanges its direction with each contraction of the heart.\r\n\r\nSimple as is their organization, the Tunicata have a nervous system. It\r\nis an unique ganglion, connected with divers small fillets. The organs\r\nof sensation present themselves in a very rudimentary fashion. We find\r\neyes, and, after very minute search, a single ear has been found. They\r\nare propagated by budding, and also from eggs. The young are subject to\r\nsome very curious metamorphoses, some particulars of which will be given\r\nfarther on.\r\n\r\nThe Tunicata are divided into _Ascidia_ and _Salpa_, to which some\r\nnaturalists add the _Brachiopoda_.\r\n\r\n\r\nASCIDIANS.\r\n\r\nThe _Ascidia_, from the Greek word ἀσχιδίον, leather bottle, have, as\r\nthe name indicates, the shape of a bottle or purse. The analogy becomes\r\nmore evident when it is considered that these creatures are habitually\r\nfilled with water, which can be expelled by very slight pressure.\r\n\r\nThe Ascidians are sometimes free, sometimes united to others in a manner\r\nmore or less intimate. Hence their division into the three groups of\r\n_simple_, _social_, and _composite_ Ascidians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124. Ascidia microcosmus (Cuvier).]\r\n\r\nSimple Ascidians attach themselves, each individual singly, to rocks and\r\nother submarine bodies, and generally at a fixed depth. _Ascidia\r\nmicrocosmus_ a Mediterranean species, represented in Fig. 124, may be\r\nquoted as a type of this division of Ascidians. The name of Microcosmus,\r\nor the little world, is probably given from its being inhabited by quite\r\nan animated colony of algæ and corals, which dwell upon its surface, and\r\ngive it a very peculiar, but not very attractive, appearance. The\r\nflavour of these molluscoids is very strong, which does not, however,\r\nhinder the poorer dwellers on the sea shore from eating them. The genus\r\n_Phallusia_ is another type of the group. _Phallusia grossularia_ is of\r\na reddish colour, and about the size of a currant-berry: it usually\r\nlodges itself in the oysters of certain localities. At Ostend another\r\nspecies, _Phallusia ampulloïdes_, is found in prodigious quantities in\r\nthe oyster parks, and is parasitic on living lobsters.\r\n\r\nSocial Ascidians comprehend living _Tunicata_, connected together on a\r\ncommon prolongation by the roots, but free and unconnected in all other\r\nrespects. _Ascidia pedunculata_ (Fig. 125) may be quoted as an example.\r\n\r\nThe Composite Ascidians are still more intimately associated together; a\r\ngreat number of these little beings live together in a single mass. Such\r\nare the Botryllus and the Pyrosoma.\r\n\r\nThe Botryllus is a genera the most interesting of all the groups under\r\nconsideration. Only imagine from ten to twenty individuals, oval in\r\nform, more or less flattened, adhering by their dorsal surface to some\r\nsubmarine body, and holding on by their sides, so as to form a sort of\r\nwheel. \"When we excite one of the branches,\" says Frédol, \"a single\r\nmollusc contracts itself; when we touch the centre, they all seem to\r\ncontract themselves (Cuvier). The buccal orifice is at the outer\r\nextremity of the radius; but the intestinal terminations abut on the\r\ncommon cavity, which occupies the centre of the wheel. Here we behold\r\ncertain animals which eat separately, but which fulfil together as a\r\ncommunity very singular functions--a kind of union and communism of\r\nwhich the moral world presents no prototype. With our molluscs, in place\r\nof two individuals united, we have a score. We may consider the entire\r\nstar as one single animal with many mouths. But then, we have with it a\r\nluxury of organs for the function of intelligence which seeks and\r\nchooses, and parsimony of the organ of stupidity, which neither seeks\r\nnor chooses.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125. Ascidia pedunculata (Milne Edwards).]\r\n\r\nWhile the Botryllus is fixed and adherent, the Pyrosoma, on the\r\ncontrary, is perfectly free. The animal colony which constitutes it\r\nfloats and balances itself upon the waters, like the sea-pen or the\r\nphysalia, of which we have spoken in treating of the zoophytes.\r\n\r\nThe name Pyrosoma has been given to these animals in consequence of\r\ntheir brilliant phosphorescent properties. According to the observations\r\nof Péron and Lesueur, nothing can exceed the brilliant and dazzling\r\nlight emitted in the bosom of the ocean by these animals. From the\r\nmanner in which the colonists dispose themselves, they form occasionally\r\nlong trains of fire; but it is a singular fact that this phosphorescence\r\npresents the same curious characteristics that distinguish the cilia of\r\nthe Beroë; namely, that the colours vary instantaneously, passing with\r\nwonderful rapidity from the most intense red to yellow, from golden\r\ncolour to orange, to green, or to azure blue. Von Humboldt saw a flock\r\nof these brilliant living colonies floating by the side of his ship, and\r\nprojecting circles of light having a radius of not less than twenty\r\ninches in diameter. He could see by this light the fishes which followed\r\nthe ship's track, during many days, at the depth of from two to three\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\nBibra, a Brazilian navigator, having caught six Pyrosoma, employed them\r\nto light up his cabin. The light produced by these little creatures was\r\nso bright, that he could read to one of his friends the description he\r\nhad written of these his living torches.\r\n\r\nThree species of Pyrosoma are known; namely, _P. elegans_, two or three\r\ninches in length, which inhabits the Mediterranean; _P. giganteum_,\r\nwhich is found in the same sea. It is a long bluish cylinder, bristling\r\nwith tubercles, each of which is the abode of an animal, a citizen of\r\nthis moving republic, and is attached to its colleagues by means of its\r\ngelatinous envelope: an alliance imposed by inexorable Nature--a forced\r\nspecies of socialism.\r\n\r\nThe third species, _P. atlanticum_, was discovered by Péron and Lesueur\r\nin the Equatorial seas.\r\n\r\nThese curious Ascidians are so created in rings as to constitute a long\r\nfine cylindrical tube, closed at one end and open at the other. By the\r\ncontraction and dilatation of the mass of beings, this great cylinder\r\nswims slowly through the open sea, lighting up the ocean with its\r\nphosphorescent light, shining through the water like a glowing fire. Mr.\r\nBennet thus describes one of these pelagic appearances: \"On the 8th of\r\nJune, being then in lat. 30° S. and 27° 5' W. long., having fine weather\r\nand a fresh south-easterly trade-wind, and the thermometer ranging from\r\n78° to 84°, late at night the mate of the watch called me to witness a\r\nvery unusual appearance in the water. This was a broad and extensive\r\nsheet of phosphorescence extending from east to west as far as the eye\r\ncould reach. I immediately cast the towing-net over the stern of the\r\nship, which soon cleaved through the brilliant mass, the disturbance\r\ncausing strong flashes of light to be emitted, and the shoal, judging\r\nfrom the time the vessel took in passing through the mass, may have been\r\na mile in breadth. On taking in the towing-net, it was found half filled\r\nwith _Pyrosoma atlanticum_, which shone with a beautiful pale greenish\r\nlight. After the mass had been passed through by the ship, the light was\r\nstill seen astern, until it became invisible in the distance, and the\r\nocean became hidden in the darkness as before this took place.\r\n\r\n\"The second occasion of my meeting these creatures was in a high\r\nlatitude, and during the winter season. It was on the 19th of August,\r\nthe weather dark and gloomy, with light breezes from north-northeast, in\r\nlat. 40° 30' S., and 138° 3' E. long., at the western entrance to Bass's\r\nStraits, and about 8 o'clock p.m., when the ship's wake was perceived to\r\nbe luminous, while scintillations of the same light were abundant all\r\nround. To ascertain the cause, I threw the towing-net overboard, and in\r\ntwenty minutes succeeded in capturing several Pyrosoma, which gave out\r\ntheir usual pale green light; and it was, no doubt, detached groups of\r\nthese animals which were the occasion of the light in question. The\r\nbeautiful light given out by these molluscans soon ceased to be seen;\r\nbut by moving them about it could be reproduced for some length of time\r\nafter. The luminosity of the water gradually decreased during the night,\r\nand toward morning was no longer seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe genus _Salpa_ forms another interesting group of Tunicata.\r\n\r\nThe Biphora or Salpa (Fig. 126) are long transparent threads of the more\r\ndelicate tissues, composed of rows of individuals placed side by side,\r\nand grafted, as it were, transversely: ribbons, in which each animal is\r\ngrafted end on end to its sister: double parallel chains of social\r\ncreatures, sometimes alternate, sometimes opposite; living chaplets, of\r\nwhich each pearl is an individual. Each individual presents an oblong\r\ndiaphanous or prismatic body, more or less symmetrical, and often\r\nfurnished in front, rarely behind, with tentaculiform appendages. So\r\ngreat is the transparency, that the various organs may be observed\r\nthrough the skin as they perform their several functions.\r\n\r\nMomus, an ancient philosopher, thought it a subject of regret that\r\nNature had not thought of piercing the body with an opening sufficiently\r\nlarge for each one to see what was passing in the interior. The creature\r\nwhich now occupies our attention would surely have satisfied the demands\r\nof our critic: its body is, metaphorically speaking, a house of glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126. Salpa maxima magnified (Forsk).]\r\n\r\nIn order to move itself, the Salpa has recourse to a singular artifice.\r\nIt introduces water into its body through a posterior opening, furnished\r\nwith a valve, which it expels by an anterior outlet situated near the\r\nmouth. It is thus pushed backwards, and swims, as it were, by recoil.\r\nMoreover, it swims with its belly upwards. All the elements of a chain\r\nof Salpas act in concert; they contract and dilate simultaneously; they\r\nadvance as a single individual. One of them floats on the surface with\r\nthe undulations of a serpent, so that among sailors they have gained the\r\nappellation of sea-serpents. These long, living trains abound in the\r\nMediterranean, principally towards the African coast, and in the\r\nEquatorial seas. They are inhabitants of the open sea, and live immerged\r\nat considerable depths; but when the nights are calm they show\r\nthemselves on the surface. As they spread themselves abroad with a\r\nstrong phosphorescent light, they resemble long ribbons of fire,\r\nunrolling their long waving lines in spite of the waves, as in Fig. 127.\r\nWhat wonders they see who go down into the great deep! What sights are\r\nreserved for the navigator who traverses the Tropical seas during the\r\nsilence of night!\r\n\r\nWhen a chain of Salpas is drawn from the water, the rings separate, and\r\nthey can no longer be made to adhere. The social bond has been dissolved\r\nby a superior force.\r\n\r\nSalpas are sometimes met with, isolated and solitary, whose exterior\r\nconformation differs much from that which is proper to the connected\r\nSalpa; so different, indeed, that it might belong to another type.\r\nChamisso, Krohn, and Milne Edwards have ascertained that the Biphora is\r\nviviparous, and that each species is propogated by alternate generation,\r\nthe young creature being unlike its immediate parent. One of these\r\ngenerations is represented by the solitary individuals, the other by an\r\naggregation of individuals. Each solitary Biphora engenders a new\r\ngroup--a chain; each constituted member of the chain engenders a\r\nsolitary Salpa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127. Phosphorescent chain of Salpas on the surface\r\nof the sea.]\r\n\r\nThus a Salpa is not organized like its mother or daughter, but rather\r\nlike its sister, its grandmother, or granddaughter--another example of\r\nalternate generation, which has already been discussed in treating of\r\nzoophytes.\r\n\r\nThose marine creatures which pass their lives in a forced\r\ncommunity--animals which eat, sleep, or rest always in company--who\r\nabandon themselves together to the soft caresses of the waves,--these\r\ncolonies, or, rather, republics of animals, leading constantly the same\r\nmonotonous existence,--reveal to us very strange things: an identical\r\ncommunity of sentiments in a crowd of beings riveted by the same\r\nchain--a chain at once physical, intellectual, and moral!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nACEPHALOUS MOLLUSCA.\r\n\r\n    \"Sigiliatim mortales, cunctum perpetul.\"\r\n\r\n    APULEIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca proper were divided by Cuvier into five great classes:--\r\n\r\nI. Lamellibranchiata, or Acephalous Mollusca, often called Conchifera.\r\nII. Brachiopoda. III. Gasteropoda. IV. Pteropoda. V. Cephalopoda.\r\n\r\nThe name Mollusca indicates the characters which most struck the\r\nancients: they are soft--in Latin, _mollis_: their flesh is cold, humid,\r\nand viscous. In consequence of their very softness, they are generally\r\nfurnished with an apparatus of defence or protection, in the shape of a\r\ncalcareous cuirass, called a _shell_. According to the species this test\r\nis a coat of mail, a buckler, or a tower. The mollusc is thus armed and\r\ndefended against all attacks from without, nearly after the manner of a\r\nknight of the middle ages; only the knight was not quite shut up in his\r\narmour, while the mollusc is attached to it by indissoluble organic\r\nbonds. \"Such a life and such a habitation!\" says Michelet. \"In no other\r\ncreature is there the same identity between the inhabitant and the nest.\r\nDrawn from its own substance, the edifice is the continuation of its\r\nfleshy mantle. It follows its form and tints. The architect has\r\ncommunicated its own substance to the edifice.\"\r\n\r\nThe shell of the Mollusca has been variously appreciated by naturalists.\r\n\"We might regard the shell as the bone of the animal which occupies it,\"\r\nsays a celebrated French naturalist; and then gives expression to a very\r\ndifferent view. \"We may say as a general thesis that testaceous\r\nmolluscs are animals with whom ossification is thrown out on the\r\nexternal surface in place of the interior, as in the Mammals, birds,\r\nreptiles, and fishes. In the case of the superior animals the bones lie\r\nin the depths of the body; in the shelled Mollusca the bones are placed\r\non the superficies. It is the same system reversed.\"\r\n\r\nOther zoologists reject as altogether untenable this assimilative\r\ntheory. \"The shell which serves as a dwelling and a shelter cannot,\" say\r\nthese authors, \"be considered as a skeleton, because it does not assume\r\nthe external form of the animal; because it does not attach itself to\r\nthe organs of locomotion; and, finally, because it is the product of\r\nsecretion, which increases in proportion to the development of the body\r\nitself.\" This last opinion appears to us to be the most acceptable.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, from the immense variety of form and size, from the\r\nbeauty and brilliancy of their colours, the shells of the molluscs are\r\namong the most attractive objects of natural history. Nor is it from\r\ntheir beauty alone that a fine collection of shells becomes interesting:\r\na living creature has inhabited the shell, a creature which in its\r\norganization and its life, above all, by its habits, excites in a high\r\ndegree our interest, curiosity, and admiration. It has been said that\r\nthe shell \"is like a medal struck by the hand of Nature to commemorate\r\nclimates.\" In short, the waters of different regions of the globe,\r\nwhether fresh or salt, are characterized by the presence of particular\r\nshells; moreover, the comparison of living shells with those which lie\r\nin a fossilized state buried in the depths of the soil is a most\r\nimportant element of our knowledge touching the origin of the different\r\nbeds out of which our globe is constituted.\r\n\r\nThus, we must not shut our eyes to these beings, in appearance so\r\nmiserable and obscure, if we would possess a general knowledge of the\r\nanimal kingdom. The Creator has endowed them with many wonderful gifts\r\nto embellish their lives, and who would dare to disregard them? Who\r\ncould examine and compare their structure without being charmed with the\r\nstudy? Man, who descends into the depths of the earth in search of the\r\nprecious metals--who dives into the deep in pursuit of the treasures it\r\nconceals--who stoops his head over works of art--would surely not refuse\r\nto bend himself for a moment to the sand of the sea, to gather in his\r\nhand, to bring nearer to his eyes, these marvellous works of the Divine\r\nCreator!\r\n\r\nThe true molluscs are divisible into two great classes: the Acephalous,\r\nor Headless, and those having a head of structure more or less perfect,\r\nwhich are called Cephalous Molluscs.\r\n\r\nThe Acephalous or Headless Molluscs are so called from the Greek ἀ,\r\nprivative, and κεϕαλὴ, head. They have no head; the body is\r\nsurrounded by the folds of the skin; the shell consists of two valves.\r\nSuch is a summary description of all the Acephalous Molluscs. They are\r\nsometimes naked, and sometimes enclosed in a shell, whence they are\r\nknown as Testaceous Molluscs. They are called _bivalves_, because their\r\nshell consists of two halves, or valves united by a hinge. They are\r\nsheltered in this double carapace as a book is in its cover.\r\n\r\nAlthough they have no head, they can feed themselves, and they reproduce\r\ntheir kind. They have friendships and enmities, perhaps even passions;\r\nprobably these are not very lively, for most of them scarcely ever\r\nchange their place, even to make the least movement. Many of them remain\r\nfixed to the rock on which they were hatched, and tumultuous sensations\r\nare not quite compatible with immobility.\r\n\r\nThe bivalves[8] are found in every sea. The shell of the bivalve is\r\novoid, globulous, trigonal, heart-shaped, elongated like a pea-pod, or\r\nflat like the leaves of a tree, having an opening down the ventral side.\r\nIn some one valve is flat, the other round and swelling in the centre.\r\nThe shell is thus an outer envelope, consisting of two pieces, more or\r\nless corresponding to each other in size and shape (of which the oyster\r\nis an example), formed of carbonate of lime deposited in membranous\r\ncells in its outer layers, the inner layers being composed of thin\r\ncoatings of lime deposited in the outer surface of the tissue, called\r\nthe mantle leaves. The valves are united to the animal by the insertion\r\nof certain muscles, and by the horny epidermis of the mantle, which\r\nstretches over the edge of the valves. The hinge and ligament which\r\nunite the two valves consist of a dense elastic substance, somewhat\r\nresembling india-rubber; the hinge is formed of teeth, and cavities into\r\nwhich the teeth fit. The ligament acts in opposition to certain\r\ncontractile muscles within, which draw them together, and is placed\r\neither within or without the hinge, or partly both. On separating the\r\nvalves, the two leaves of the mantle present themselves. These are thin\r\ndelicate leaves, furnished at the margin with sensitive tentacles and\r\nother organs of sense, and with glands sometimes highly coloured. The\r\nuse of these organs is thus described by Mr. Rymer Jones:--\r\n\r\n\"When the animal is engaged in increasing the dimensions of its abode,\r\nthe margin of the mantle is protruded and firmly adherent all round to\r\nthe circumference of the valve with which it corresponds. Thus\r\ncircumstanced, it secretes calcareous matter and deposits it upon the\r\nextreme edge of the shell, when the secretion hardens and becomes\r\nconverted into a layer of solid testaceous substance. At intervals this\r\nprocess is repeated, and every newly-formed layer enlarges the diameter\r\nof the valve. The concentric strata thus deposited remain\r\ndistinguishable externally, and thus the lines of growth marking the\r\nprogressive increase of size may easily be traced.\"\r\n\r\n\"While the margin of the mantle is thus the sole agent in enlarging the\r\ncircumference of the shell,\" the professor continues farther on, \"its\r\ngrowth in thickness is accomplished by a secretion of a kind of\r\ncalcareous varnish derived from the external surface of the mantle\r\ngenerally, which, being deposited layer by layer over the whole interior\r\nof the previously existing shell, progressively adds to its weight and\r\nsolidity. There is, however, a remarkable difference in character\r\nbetween the material secreted by the marginal fringe and that furnished\r\nby the general surface of the mantle membrane. The former we have found\r\nmore or less covered by glands appointed for the purpose, situated in\r\nthe circumference of the mantle; but as these glands do not exist\r\nelsewhere, no colouring matter is ever mixed with the layers that\r\nincrease the thickness of the shell, so that the latter always remain of\r\na delicate whitish hue, and form the well known iridescent material\r\nusually distinguished by the name of nacre or mother-of-pearl.\"\r\n(_General Outline_, p. 385.)\r\n\r\nThe process by which shells attain their beautiful markings is thus\r\ndescribed by Mr. Jones:--\"The external surface is exclusively deposited\r\nby the margin of the mantle, which contains in its substance certain\r\ncoloured spots, which are found to be of a glandular character, and to\r\nowe their peculiar character to a pigment they secrete, which is mixed\r\nwith the calcareous matter; coloured lines are therefore found on the\r\nexterior of the shell wherever these glandular organs exist. Where the\r\ndeposition of colour is kept up throughout the process of enlargement,\r\nthe lines are unbroken and perfect; but where the coloured matter is\r\nfurnished only at intervals, spots and patches of irregular form and\r\nincreasing in size with the enlargement of the mantle are the\r\nconsequence.\"\r\n\r\nBivalves move about and change from place to place by means of an\r\nextensible fleshy organ called, from some of its functions, a foot; in\r\nfact, it has less resemblance to a foot than to a large tongue. It is a\r\nmuscular mass, capable of being pushed out from between the mantle and\r\nthe valves, and varies much in form; it is in turn a hatchet, a\r\nventilator, a pole, an awl, a finger, and a sort of whip. This foot is\r\nsimple, forked, or fringed. In some species the tissues are spongy, and\r\ncapable of receiving considerable quantities of water. When the organ\r\nswells, it is elongated and stiff; on the other hand, by suddenly\r\nexpelling all the water, it gets small and pliable, and can now return\r\nto its shell. This organ is represented in Fig. 128 (_Donax trunculus_,\r\nLinn.), in which it is singularly developed. This bivalve is found on\r\nthe sea shore in shallow water; it buries itself almost perpendicularly\r\nin the sands. They are so abundant on the French side of the Channel and\r\non the shores of the Mediterranean, that they form a considerable\r\nportion of the people's food. These bivalves have the singular power of\r\nleaping to a considerable height and then throwing themselves to a\r\ndistance of ten or twelve inches--a spectacle which may be witnessed any\r\nday at low water. When abandoned by the retreating tide, they try to\r\nregain the sea. If seized by the hand, in order to drag them out of the\r\nsand, aided by their compressed, branched, and angular feet, they give\r\nto their shell the sudden and energetic movement under which the\r\nbounding action takes place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128. Donax trunculus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe shell of the Donax is slightly triangular and compressed; its length\r\nexceeds its height; it is regular, univalve, unequally lateral, and its\r\nhinge bears three or four teeth on each valve. The action of these feet\r\nis very simple, and is compared by Réaumur to that of a man placed on\r\nhis belly, who, stretching out one hand, seizes upon some fixed object,\r\nand draws himself towards it. There is just this difference, that the\r\nmovement of the member in the mollusc is altogether contractile.\r\n\r\nAuthors have described more than 30,000 species of molluscs, so that our\r\nspace only permits us to describe a few families, or rather types of\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of bivalves now most generally adopted in England is\r\nthat of Woodward, as developed in the last edition of his manual of the\r\nmollusca; it is greatly based on that of Lamarck. We have adopted his\r\narrangement altered from a descending to an ascending scale of\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nThe Conchifera are divisible into two sections, Siphonida, from the\r\nanimals having respiratory siphons, and Asiphonida, destitute of them.\r\n\r\nThe solen may be taken as a type of the first, and the oyster of the\r\nsecond. The division Siphonida is divided into two sub-sections, those\r\nwithout and those with a pallial line sinuated. The first family of this\r\nsection is the Pholadidæ, which includes Teredo, Xylophaga, and Pholas,\r\nanimals which possess extraordinary powers of boring; not merely as the\r\nSolens do, through sand, but through the hardest rocks.\r\n\r\nThe _Teredos_ are marine animals having a special and irresistible\r\ninclination for submerged wood; for while wood exposed to the air\r\nbecomes a prey to terrestrial animals, so submerged wood is subject to\r\ninvasion by aquatic animals, of which the Teredo is by far the most\r\nformidable. The Teredos in the bosom of the ocean perforate the hardest\r\ntimbers, whatever be their essence. The galleries bored by these\r\nimperceptible miners riddle the whole interior of a piece of wood,\r\ndestroying it entirely, without the slightest external indication of its\r\nravages. The galleries sometimes follow the grain of the wood; sometimes\r\nthey cut it at right angles; the miners, in fact, change their route the\r\nmoment they meet in their way either the furrows hollowed out by one of\r\ntheir congeners, or some ancient and abandoned gallery. By a strange\r\nkind of instinct, however multiplied may be their furrows or tubes in\r\nthe same piece of wood, they never mingle--there is never any\r\ncommunication between them. The wood is thus attacked at a thousand\r\ndiverse points, until it is invaded and its entire substance destroyed.\r\nIt is by secret ravages of this kind that the piles and other submarine\r\nconstructions upon which bridges are built are often riddled and\r\nperforated. They appear to all outward examination as solid and perfect\r\nas at the moment they were first driven; but they yield to the least\r\neffort, bringing ruin and destruction on the edifices they support.\r\nShips have been thus silently and secretly mined, until the planks\r\ncrumbled into dust under the feet of the sailors. Others have gone down\r\nwith their crews, entirely caused by the ravages of these relentless\r\nenemies, which are terrible from their unapproachable littleness.\r\n\r\nM. Quatrefages, who has minutely studied the organization and habits of\r\nthe Teredos in the Port of Saint Sebastian, reports the following fact,\r\nwhich will give the reader some idea of the rapidity with which these\r\ndangerous molluscs pursue their ravages:--\r\n\r\n\"A boat, which served as a passage-boat between two villages on the\r\ncoast, went down in consequence of an accident at the commencement of\r\nspring. Four months after some fishermen, hoping to turn her materials\r\nto advantage, raised the boat. But in that short space of time the\r\nTeredos had committed such ravages that the planks and timbers were\r\nriddled and worm-eaten so as to be totally useless.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century, half the coast of Holland\r\nwas threatened with annihilation because the piles which support its\r\ndikes and sea-walls were attacked by the Teredo; and it proved no\r\ncontemptible foe. Many hundreds of thousands of pounds were expended in\r\norder to avert the threatened danger. Fortunately, a closer attention to\r\nthe habits of the mollusc has brought a remedy to a most formidable\r\nevil; the mollusc has an inveterate antipathy to rust, and timber\r\nimpregnated by the oxide of iron is safe from its ravages. This taste of\r\nthe Teredo being known, it is only necessary, in order to scatter this\r\ndangerous host, to sink the timber which is to be submerged in a tank of\r\nprepared oxide of iron--clothed, in short, in a thick cuirass of that\r\nantipathy of the Teredo, iron rust. Ships' timbers are also served with\r\nthe same protecting coating; but the copper in which ships' bottoms are\r\nusually sheathed serves the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe singular Acephalous Mollusc known to naturalists as the _Teredo\r\nnavalis_, and popularly as the Ship Worm (Fig. 129), has the appearance\r\nof a long worm without articulations. Between the valves of a little\r\nshell, with which it is provided anteriorly, may be seen a sort of\r\nsmooth truncature, which surrounds a swelling projecting pad or cushion.\r\nThis cushion is the only part of the body of the animal which can be\r\nregarded as a foot. Starting from this point, all the body of the Teredo\r\nis enveloped by the shell and mantle, which form a sort of sheath\r\ncommunicating by two syphons with the exterior.\r\n\r\nThe mantle adheres to the circumference of the shell. Above, it forms\r\ntwo great folds, which may both be swollen by the afflux of the blood,\r\nand acquire considerable size. One of these folds placed in advance,\r\nwhich is called the _cephalic hood_, is worthy of attention. The tissue\r\nof the mantle is of a greyish tint, very light, and transparent enough,\r\nespecially in the young, to permit of the mass of liver, the ovary, the\r\nbranchiæ, and the heart being distinguished in the interior, even to\r\ncounting its pulsations. The syphons are extensible, and attached the\r\none to the other for about two-thirds of their length, the upper part\r\nbeing longer and thinner than the lower. It is by these tubes that the\r\naërated water enters which feeds and enables the animal to breathe. It\r\nis discharged by the second tube, when deprived of its oxygen, and no\r\nlonger respirable, carrying with it the useless products of digestion.\r\nThis movement is continuous; but from time to time the animal shuts at\r\nonce the orifices of both tubes, and slightly contracts itself.\r\n\r\nThe shell, seen on the side, presents an irregularly triangular form; it\r\nis nearly as broad as it is long; its two valves are solidly attached\r\nthe one to the other, above and below, by the mantle in such a manner as\r\nonly to permit of very slight movements. It is coloured in yellow and\r\nbrown lines; sometimes it is quite plain. On the upper edge of the\r\nanterior truncature of the body of the animal is the mouth, a sort of\r\nfunnel, flat and slightly bell-shaped, furnished with four labial palpi,\r\na stomach without any peculiar feature, and a well-developed intestine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129. Teredo navalis (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe heart consists of two auricles and a ventricle, which beat at very\r\nirregular intervals, four or five in the minute. The blood is\r\ncolourless, transparent, and charged with small irregular corpuscles.\r\nThe act of breathing is accomplished in the branchiæ, or gills, and\r\nmantle. Nevertheless, the one half of the blood returns to the heart\r\nwithout passing through these branchiæ.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system is well developed, and consists of a brain, nervous\r\nfilaments, and of ganglions, which are distributed in the mantle, the\r\nbranchiæ, and the syphon tubes.\r\n\r\nThe adult animal is surrounded by a sort of sheath, consisting of a\r\nsolid mucus, which has sometimes been described erroneously as forming\r\npart of the animal. The Teredo, shut up in this tube, is limited in its\r\nmovements; when observed in a vase, its motions are slow and\r\ndeliberate--movements of extension and contraction, by the aid of which\r\nit contrives with difficulty to change its place; but nothing indicates\r\na true creeping movement. In a state of nature, according to M.\r\nQuatrefages, the body of the animal is stretched out to three times its\r\nlength without diminishing in any respect its proportional thickness;\r\nthe afflux of water penetrating under the mantle, and of the blood which\r\naccumulates in the interior vessels, sufficiently accounting for a\r\nphenomenon which at the first glance is very singular.\r\n\r\nThe Teredo deposits a spherical greenish-yellow egg. Shortly after\r\nfecundation, these eggs are transformed into larvæ. At first naked and\r\nmotionless, these larvæ are soon covered with vibratile cilia, when they\r\nbegin to move, at first by a revolving pirouette, afterwards swimming\r\nabout freely in the water. When one of these larvæ has found a piece of\r\nsubmerged wood, without which it probably could not live, the curious\r\nspectacle is observed of a being which fabricates, step by step, and as\r\nit requires them, the organs necessary for the performance of its\r\nfunctions. It begins by creeping along the surface of the wood by means\r\nof the very long feet with which it is furnished. Then it is observed\r\nfrom time to time to open and shut the valves of the little embryo shell\r\nwhich partly envelopes it. As soon as it has found a part of the wood\r\nsufficiently soft and porous for its purpose, it pauses, attacks the\r\nligneous substance, and soon produces a little pore, or cell, which will\r\nbe the entrance to the future canal.\r\n\r\nOnce fairly lodged in this little cell, the young Teredo is rapidly\r\ndeveloped; it covers itself with a coating of mucous matter, which,\r\ncondensing by degrees, assumes a brownish tint, forming a solid\r\ncovering, with two small holes for the passage of the syphon tubes. At\r\nthe end of three days this covering has become quite solid; it is the\r\ncommencement of the organized tube, in which the animal is to be\r\ndeveloped. When secured beneath this opaque screen, the little miner is\r\nno longer exposed to observation; but if his cell is opened at the end\r\nof a few days, it is found that it has secreted a new shell, larger and\r\nmore solid than the original one; it is the shell of the adult animal.\r\n\r\nThe young Teredo, which feeds on the raspings of the wood, increases\r\nrapidly; it passes first from a spheroid form to an elongated shape, and\r\nwhen its body can no longer be contained in the shell, it projects\r\nbeyond the edge, and would find itself naked were it not protected by\r\nits membranous sheath, which adheres to the walls of the ligneous\r\nchannel, now the dwelling-place of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe process by which a creature soft and naked like the Teredo should\r\nbreak into a solid piece of the hardest wood so quickly, and destroy it\r\nwith so much facility, was long a mystery. Until very recently, the\r\nshell was looked on as the implement of perforation. But in that case\r\nthe shell should preserve certain traces of its action upon surfaces so\r\nresistant as oak and fir; but the shell, on the contrary, is perfect,\r\nwith no signs of friction. On the other hand, the muscular apparatus of\r\nthe Teredo is not calculated to put the shell into rotatory action, were\r\nthe process a boring one. It does not seem therefore possible to\r\nattribute these perforations to a simple physical action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130. Pholas dactylus having hollowed out a shelter\r\nin a block of gneiss.]\r\n\r\nSome naturalists have suggested, in explanation of this phenomenon, that\r\nthe animal is furnished with the means of secreting a liquid capable of\r\ndissolving the woody fibre. This has been met by the statement that, in\r\nwhatever way the wood is attacked, whether the gallery is excavated with\r\nor across the fibre of the wood, the groove is as exactly and neatly cut\r\nas if it had been perforated by the sharpest tool, and that a corroding\r\ndissolvent could not act with this regularity, but would attack the\r\nharder and more tender parts unequally. This objection, which M.\r\nQuatrefages opposes to the idea of a chemical solvent, appears to us to\r\nadmit of no reply. But, while opposing unassailable reasons against two\r\ntheories, the learned author does not leave us without a very reasonable\r\nexplanation of a very puzzling phenomenon. \"Let us not forget,\" he says,\r\n\"that the interior of the gallery is constantly saturated with water;\r\nconsequently all the points of the walls which are not protected by the\r\ntube are subjected to constant maceration. In this state a mechanical\r\naction, even very inconsiderable, would suffice to clear away the bed of\r\nfibre thus softened, and, if this action is in any degree continuous, it\r\nsuffices to explain the excavation of the galleries, however extensive\r\ntheir ramifications. Again, the upper cutaneous folds, especially the\r\ncephalic hood already mentioned, having the power of expanding at will\r\nby an afflux of blood, covered with a thick coriaceous epidermis, and\r\nmoved by four strong muscles, seems to me very capable of performing the\r\noperation. It appears very probable that it is this hood which is\r\ncharged with the removal of the woody fibre, rendering it incapable of\r\nresistance by previous maceration, which may also be assisted by some\r\nsecretion from the animal.\" That the fleshy parts of the mollusc, acting\r\nupon the surface, softened by long maceration in water, is the true\r\nboring implement employed by the Teredo, is, probably, the only\r\nexplanation the case admits of; at all events, in the present state of\r\nour knowledge, the explanation of the learned naturalist is the most\r\nreasonable which can be given.\r\n\r\nThe engraving (Fig. 130) represents _P. dactylus_, which has hollowed\r\nitself a home out of a block of gneiss. This dwelling is a cell just\r\ndeep enough to contain the animal and its shell, as represented in Fig.\r\n131. To excavate its cell at the bottom of one of these gloomy retreats\r\nseems to be all that the animal lives for. To ascend to the summit or\r\nsink to the bottom of their narrow house makes up all the accidents of\r\nexistence to these strange creatures: the hole they dig is at once their\r\ndwelling and their grave; which is attested both by the rocks of the\r\npast and the present.\r\n\r\nIn its structure the shell differs notably from other Acephalous\r\nMolluscs, which led Linnæus to place it with the multivalve shells.\r\nBetween the two ordinary valves, in short, this shell presents certain\r\naccessary pieces, smaller than the true valves, and placed near the\r\nhinge, as represented in _Pholas dactylus_ (Fig. 131), pieces which\r\nwould not be there without a purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131. Pholas dactylus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe shell is equivalve, gaping on each side, swelling below, very thin,\r\ntransparent, and white. The animal is a thick, white, elongated, fleshy\r\nbody; its mouth opening anteriorly, throws out a long tube traversed by\r\ntwo canals or syphons, through one of which the water necessary for the\r\nrespiration of the animal is absorbed, and ejected through the other.\r\nThrough another opening in the mantle a very thick and short foot is\r\nprotruded.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways of accounting for this creature's method of\r\nboring--the mechanical, the chemical, and the electric; the first being\r\nthe one generally held. In this case the animal uses its foot as a\r\nboring tool. The second presumes on the Pholas secreting an acid which\r\ncorrodes the rock; the third that it possesses a galvanic battery with\r\nsimilar powers. It is possible that all these three theories may have a\r\nmeasure of truth. That the foot of the borer is used is clear. The\r\nluminosity which is so characteristic of the animal is in favour of an\r\nelectric current, which is almost always accompanied by chemical\r\ndecomposition, which would set free the hydrochloric acid of the sea\r\nwater. The small size of the entrance to the chambers of the Pholas is\r\naccounted for by the increase of its size during its residence there. De\r\nBlainville thought that a simple movement of the shell incessantly\r\nrepeated would suffice to pierce the stone, macerated by the sea water\r\nwhich passed through the breathing apparatus.\r\n\r\nMr. Robertson, of Brighton, exhibited the living Pholas in the act of\r\nboring through masses of chalk, and thinks the process entirely effected\r\nby the simple mechanical action of the \"hydraulic apparatus, rasp, and\r\nsyringe.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you examine these living shells,\" says Gosse, \"you will see that the\r\nfore part, where the foot protrudes, is set with stony points arranged\r\nin transverse and longitudinal rows, the former being the result of\r\nelevated ridges, radiating from the hinge, the latter that of the edges\r\nof successive growths of the shell. These points have the most accurate\r\nresemblance to those set on a steel rasp in a blacksmith's shop. It is\r\ninteresting to know that the shell is preserved from being itself\r\nprematurely worn away by the fact that it is composed of aragonite, a\r\nsubstance much harder than those rocks in which the Pholas burrows. The\r\nanimal,\" Gosse adds, \"turns in its burrow from side to side when at\r\nwork, adhering to the interior by the foot, and therefore only partially\r\nrotating to and fro. The substance is abraded in the form of a fine\r\npowder, which is gradually ejected from the mouth of the hole by\r\ncontraction of the bronchial syphon.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pholades are met with on every sea shore, and are plentiful in the\r\nChannel; on the French coast they are called _Dails_, and sought for\r\ntheir fine flavour. As examples of the genus, we may quote _Pholas\r\ndadylus_ (Fig. 131); _Pholas candida_, found in the Channel and in the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, which lives buried in the mud or in decayed wood;\r\n_Pholas crispata_ (Fig. 132), also found in the Channel; _Pholas\r\npapyracea_ (Fig. 133); and _Pholas melanoura_ (Fig. 134).\r\n\r\nThe bodies of many genera of Mollusca have the property of shining in\r\nthe dark, but none emit a light more brilliant than that of the\r\nPholades. Those who eat the Pholades in an uncooked state (which is by\r\nno means rare, for the flavour of the mollusc does not require the aid\r\nof cooking to render it palatable) would appear in the dark as if they\r\nhad swallowed phosphorus; and the fisherman who, in a spirit of economy,\r\nsupped on this mollusc in the dark, would give to his little ones the\r\nspectacle of a fire-eater on a small scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132. Pholas crispata (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe perforations produced in stone by the Pholades have become important\r\nevidence in a geological sense. In many countries there were evident\r\nsigns of a considerable sinking of the earth. But in no place is the\r\nevidence of this so clear as in the monument of high antiquity on the\r\nPozzuolan coast, known as the Temple of Serapis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133. Pholas papyracea (Solander).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134. Pholas melanoura (Sowerby).]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the culture of oysters by the Romans, we shall have\r\noccasion to mention the disappearance of the Lucrin Lake, and its\r\nreplacement by an enormous mountain, the Monte Nuovo. Now, Pozzuolo is\r\nsituated at the foot of Monte Nuovo. We need not add that the whole\r\nneighbourhood is volcanic. Pozzuolo touches on the Solfaterra, on the\r\nLake Avernus, and is not far from Vesuvius; and in the bay is the\r\nmonument of other days, erroneously called the Temple of Serapis. In\r\nreality it was most probably a thermal establishment, established for\r\nits mineral waters, although the world has agreed to call it a temple.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, the building has been nearly levelled by the hand\r\nof time, aided by the hand of man; and the ruins now consist of three\r\nmagnificent marble columns of about forty feet high. But the curious and\r\nimportant fact is, that these three columns, at about ten feet above the\r\nsurface, are riddled with holes, and full of cavities bored deeply into\r\nthe marble, and these borings occupy the space of three feet on each\r\ncolumn. The cause of these perforations is no longer doubtful. In some\r\nof the cavities the shell of the operator is still found, and it seems\r\nsettled among naturalists that it belongs to a species of Pholas,\r\nalthough M. Pouchet, a naturalist of Rouen, denies this. \"As far,\" he\r\nsays, \"as I have been able to judge from the fragment which I extracted\r\nfrom this temple, which is destitute of the hinge, it is infinitely more\r\nprobable that this mollusc is a species of the genus _Corallisphaga_.\"\r\nIn spite, however, of M. Pouchet's scepticism, the mass of evidence is\r\nopposed to his theory.\r\n\r\nThere are two modes of explaining the fact to which we have called\r\nattention. To enable the stone-boring molluscs which live only in the\r\nsea to excavate this marble, the temple and columns must have been\r\nburied several fathoms deep in sea-water. It is only in these conditions\r\nthat the borers could have made an incision, and laboured at their ease,\r\nin the marble column.\r\n\r\nBut since the same traces of perforation are now visible ten feet above\r\nthe surface, it follows that, after being long immersed under water, the\r\ncolumns have been elevated to their present position. The temple has\r\nbeen restored to its primitive state, carrying with it, engraved in\r\nmarble, ineffaceable proofs of its immersion. Sir Charles Lyell has\r\nconsecrated a long chapter to the successive sinking and elevation of\r\nthis temple, which proves the fact most conclusively.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFamily two, the Gastrochænidæ, is a somewhat heterogeneous one, as it\r\ncontains Saxicava and Aspergillum. We have only space for a short\r\naccount of the latter, the animal which has received the strange name\r\nof the Watering Pot, and is represented in Fig. 135. It inhabits a\r\ncalcareous tube, thick, solid, of considerable length, and nearly\r\ncylindrical, presenting at one extremity an opening fringed with one or\r\nmany foliaceous folds in the form of frills, and at the other extremity\r\na convex disk, pierced with holes like a watering-pot: whence its name.\r\nThe animal is attached by certain muscles to the interior of the tube.\r\nChenu, to whom we are indebted for our information respecting this\r\ncurious mollusc, tells us \"that the animal which inhabits this curious\r\nshell was first described by Russell, whose account of it is deficient\r\nin the anatomical details, which might explain the utility of the holes\r\nin the disk of the central fissure, and of the spiriform tubes found\r\nthere.\" We suppose that this arrangement is necessary in order to\r\nfacilitate respiration; and M. De Blainville thinks the small tubes are\r\nintended for the passage of the fillets which are necessary to fix the\r\nanimal to the body on which it is to live, and in such a manner as to\r\nadmit of its movements round a fixed point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XX.--Temple of Serapis at Pozzuolo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135. Aspergillum vaginiferum (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe animal which inhabits the _Aspergillum_ is elongated, contractile,\r\nand only occupies the upper part of the tube, but it can stretch itself\r\nout sufficiently for all its wants. Shells of this genus are very rare,\r\nalthough a great number of species are known. They are found in the Red\r\nSea, and in the seas of Australia and Java. The shells are generally of\r\na white or yellowish tint; some have the tube covered with a glutinated\r\nsand, mixed with small fragments of shells of diverse colours. We know\r\nnothing of their habits, and their singular forms have left naturalists\r\nin doubt as to the place which should be assigned to them in the method\r\nof arrangement. It is only after having recognized the existence of two\r\nvalves, which was detected with great difficulty just under the disk,\r\nand forming part of the sheath in which the animal is encased, that it\r\nhas been decided to range them with the _Tubicola_, and with the shells\r\npresenting an arrangement analogous or equally singular. These molluscs\r\nare, as M. Chenu says, little known, rare, and hence much sought for by\r\ncollectors. They are exclusively exotic, the most common species being\r\nfrom Java. It is imported into Europe by the Dutch. Our third family,\r\nthe Anatinidæ, includes Myochama, Pandora, Lyonsia, Myacites,\r\nPholadomya, Thracia, and Anatina, genera which were more important in\r\nthe former than in the present seas; some, in fact, being wholly\r\nextinct, or represented, as in Pholadomya, by one or two living species.\r\nOur fourth family, the Myacidæ, including Gycimeris, is found only in\r\nAmerica; Panopaæ, now principally extinct; Thetis, Neæra, Corbula, and\r\nMya, or Gaper.\r\n\r\nOur fifth family, Solenidæ, contains the Solens, which under the name of\r\n\"razor-fish\" are so abundant on the sandy shores of all parts of the\r\nglobe. These molluscs live buried vertically in the sand, a short\r\ndistance from the shore; the hole which they have hollowed, and which\r\nthey never quit, sometimes attains as much as two yards in depth; by\r\nmeans of their foot, which is large, conical, swollen in the middle, and\r\npointed at its extremity, they raise themselves with great agility to\r\nthe entrance of their hole. They bury themselves rapidly, and disappear\r\non the slightest approach of danger.\r\n\r\nWhen the sea retires, the presence of the Solen is indicated by a small\r\norifice in the sand, whence escape at intervals bubbles of air. In order\r\nto attract them to the surface, the fishermen throw into the hole a\r\npinch of salt; immediately the sand becomes stirred, and the animal\r\npresents itself just above the point of its shell. It must be seized at\r\nonce, for it disappears again very quickly, and no renewed efforts will\r\nbring it to the surface a second time. Its retreat is commonly cut short\r\nby a knife being passed below it; for it burrows into the ground with\r\nsuch velocity that it is difficult to capture it with the hands alone.\r\n\r\nThis shell has by some been compared to a knife-handle; by others to a\r\nrazor, which has become its popular name. It is a thin, transparent,\r\nlong, and slender equivalved bivalve, with parallel edges, gaping and\r\ntruncated at both extremities. The tints are rose-coloured, bluish-grey,\r\nand violet; the valves slightly covered with an epidermis of a greenish\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nThe animal which lives in this elegant dwelling has the form of an\r\nelongated cylinder. Its mantle is closed in its whole length, and only\r\nopen at the ends at one side for the passage of the food, and at the\r\nother for the passage of a tube formed of two syphons united together.\r\nThis curious shell, various species of which are represented in PL.\r\nXIX., are known as razor-fish, sabre-fish, and other names, which in\r\nsome respects indicate the peculiar form of the shell, as well as its\r\nsharpness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.--Razor-fish. Solenidæ.\r\n\r\n    I. Solen siliqua. (Linn.)\r\n    II. Solen vagina. (Linn.)\r\n    III. Solen ensis. (Linn.)\r\n    IV. Solen ensis major. (Lamarck.)\r\n    V. Solen ambiguus. (Lamarck.)\r\n    VI. Solen legumen.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Tellinidæ, the sixth family in our table, is very important, as\r\nincluding a vast number of genera and species, of which, as types, we\r\nwill particularise Tellina and Donax; but Galatea, Mesodesma, Semele,\r\nSanguinolaria, Psammobia, and Capsula, are important genera.\r\n\r\nAlong the shores of the Channel and in the Mediterranean there are few\r\nbivalves more abundant than the several species of the genus _Donax_.\r\nThey live near the shore in shallow water, burying themselves\r\nperpendicularly in the sand. They have the very singular habit,\r\nconsidering their apparent helplessness, of being able to leap to a\r\ncertain height and then project themselves ten or twelve inches. This\r\nmay often be witnessed in the case of individuals left by the retreating\r\ntide. If seized by the hand, and attempts are made to disengage them\r\nfrom the sand, they continue to impress on their shell a sudden and\r\nenergetic movement, aided by the elasticity of their foot, which is at\r\nonce decisive and angular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136. Donax rugosus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137. Donax denticulatus.]\r\n\r\nThe shell of the _Donax_ is nearly triangular in shape, compressed,\r\nlonger than it is high, regular, equivalve, not equilateral; the hinge\r\nwith three or four teeth on each valve.\r\n\r\nThe animal is slightly compressed, and more or less triangular. Its\r\nmantle, which forms two symmetrical lobes enveloping the body, is open\r\npretty nearly in all its extent, but it is united posteriorly, and\r\nterminates in two syphons or nearly equal tubes, as in Fig. 130, p. 326.\r\nOne of these tubes serves the purpose of respiration: it is the\r\n_bronchial syphon_. The other, serving the purpose of ejecting the\r\nproducts of digestion, is termed the _anal_ tube. The tentacles of the\r\nbronchial tube seem to be possessed of exquisite sensibility. When\r\ntouched, the animal draws in its syphon, and only puts it forth anew\r\nwhen the danger has passed. The species of _Donax_ are very numerous,\r\nespecially in the Asiatic and American seas. Among the European species\r\nwe may mention _Donax rugosus_ (Fig. 136) and _Donax denticulatus_ (Fig.\r\n137).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138. Tellina radiata (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139. Tellina virgata (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140. Tellina sulphurea (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141. Tellina donacina (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nNext to _Donax_ naturalists rank the genus _Tellina_, which includes\r\nmany species of very minute shells, all remarkable for their beauty of\r\nform, and for their brilliant and varied colours. One of these, called\r\nthe Rising Sun (_Tellina radiata_), is represented in Fig. 138. The\r\nTellinas are found in every sea; the French coast furnishes many\r\nspecies: examples, _Tellina virgata_ (Fig. 139) and _Tellina sulphurea_\r\n(Lamarck) (Fig. 140). In Fig. 141 _Tellina donacina_ is represented with\r\nits two vital tubes, or syphons.\r\n\r\nThe seventh family, or Mactridæ, include Lutraria and Mactra, or the\r\notter and kneading-trough shells. They are widely distributed; there are\r\nseveral British species of both.\r\n\r\nThe eighth family, Veneridæ, includes Venus, Cytherea, Meroe, and\r\nArtemis; beautiful genera, and as such called by Linnæus and his\r\nfollowers after heroines of Greek mythology. Petricola, Venerupis,\r\nTapes, Lucinopsis, and Trigona, also belong to the family. These\r\nacephalæ of size so small, like their congeners, inhabit every sea; they\r\nare found in every region of the globe, more than a hundred and fifty\r\nspecies being known. The shell is elliptic in form, the valves smooth,\r\nstriated, spiny, and lamellous, like those of Cardium and Donax. Like\r\nthese, they bury themselves in the sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142. Venus verrucosa (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143. Cytherea geographica (Chemnitz).]\r\n\r\nAmong the vast number of species, many of them are extremely rare, and\r\nmuch sought after by collectors in consequence of their great beauty. In\r\nthe principal ports of France, _Venus verrucosa_ (Fig. 142), and another\r\nspecies known in the south of France under the name of Clovisse, are\r\neaten there like oysters. Prepared with fine herbs, the Clovisse, we\r\nhave M. Figuier's authority for saying, is not to be despised. \"We may\r\nbe believed also,\" he says, \"if we add that nothing is more delicious\r\nthan to eat the living Clovisse torn from the rock of the Phara of Lake\r\nThau, when the Mediterranean sun of a day in winter is shining down upon\r\nus, the heart rejoicing in manhood's strength.\" In PL. XVIII. some of\r\nthe principal species are represented, along with some of the more\r\nremarkable species of _Cytherea_. In Fig. 143 we have the elegantly\r\npencilled shell of _Cytherea geographica_, together with the animal in\r\nits natural connection.\r\n\r\nThe sub-section we shall now treat of is without the pallial line\r\nsinuated. The Cyprinidæ form the ninth family of our arrangement of the\r\nConchifera, and contain, Cardia, Cypricardia, Isocardia, Crassatella,\r\nAstarte, Circe, and Cyprina, which amount together to some hundred\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe Cycladidæ are our tenth family, and include Cyrenoides, Cyrena,\r\nPisidium, and Cyclas.\r\n\r\nThe Lucinidæ is the eleventh family, containing Galeomma, Lepton,\r\nMontacuta, Kelia, Diplodonta, Corbis, and Lucina.\r\n\r\nIn the small family of which we have made the Tridacna the\r\nrepresentative, as well as in some preceding families, the mantle of the\r\nanimal is more or less largely open, but never with such a prolongation\r\nas to form tubes. In the _Cardiums_, now under consideration, as well as\r\n_Donax_, _Tellina_, and _Venus_, the respiratory organs are somewhat\r\nmodified, so as to adapt them to the habits of the animal. All these\r\nmolluscs live buried in the mud or sand, and two great tubes issuing\r\nfrom the interior of their bodies bring the atmospheric air into\r\ncommunication with their respiratory organ--namely, the _branchial\r\nleaves_.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth family, Cardiadæ, contains the familiar\r\ncockles--Cardium--which is derived from καρδὶα, _a heart_, which\r\nthey are supposed to resemble in form, are amongst the most\r\nwidely-distributed of shells. The shell is convex, as we see in _C.\r\nhians_ (Fig. 144), somewhat heart-shaped, equivalved, the edges dentate\r\nor corrugated, the hinge furnished with four teeth upon each valve. The\r\naccessary ornaments vary with the species, some being smooth, as in\r\n_Cardium Greenlandicum_, Chemnitz (Fig. 145); others, and by far the\r\ngreater number, are furnished with regular sides, generally obtuse,\r\nsometimes in ridges diverging from the point and armed with straight or\r\ncurved spines, arranged in the oddest manner, as in _Cardium aculeatum_\r\n(Fig. 146).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.--Venus and Cytherea.\r\n\r\n    I. Venus plicata. (Gmel.)\r\n    II. Venus puerpera. (Linn.)\r\n    III. Venus reticulata. (Linn.)\r\n    IV. Venus Gnidia. (Broderip.)\r\n    V. Cytherea zonaria. (Lamarck.)\r\n    VI. Cytherea petechialis. (Lamarck.)\r\n    VII. Cytherea maculata. (Linn.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn _C. hians_ (Fig. 144), the mantle has a large opening in front,\r\nfringed anteriorly with papillæ in the form of tentacula; the\r\ninhabitant of the shell has a very large foot, with a bend or knee\r\nnear the middle; its mouth is transverse and funnel-shaped, and\r\nfurnished with a triangular appendage. One of the peculiarities in the\r\norganization of these molluscs is its direct connection with their mode\r\nof life. In short, these molluscs, which most commonly live on the sea\r\nshore, and bury themselves in the sand to the depth of four or five\r\ninches, are enabled to breathe, to draw water for their nourishment, and\r\nalso to throw off the products of digestion, by having the mantle\r\nprolonged into two tubes, the orifices of which reach to the surface of\r\nthe soil. By means of these feet and an extremely curious organ of\r\nlocomotion, the Cardiums can at will issue from their holes and re-enter\r\nthem. The fishermen of the shore easily recognize the presence of these\r\nanimals by the little jets of water which they throw up through the\r\nsands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144. Cardium hians (Brocchi).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145. Cardium Greenlandicum (Chemnitz).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146. Cardium aculeatum (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147. Cardium edulis (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThese molluscs are found in every sea on the globe, and under all\r\nlatitudes. Many of them belong to our own and the French coasts, where\r\nthey are eagerly sought for by collectors, as well as for food. The\r\nflesh of the animal, however, is coriaceous, and little esteemed. The\r\nspecies most common on the littoral of the Atlantic is _Cardium edulis_\r\n(Fig. 147), its white or fawn-coloured shell being hollowed out into six\r\nand twenty furrows, forming so many corrugated ripples on its side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148. Cardium costatum (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n_Cardium costatum_ (Fig. 148) is an exotic species which inhabits the\r\ncoast of Guinea and the Senegal, the shell of which, white and fragile,\r\nis much sought after by collectors.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth family of our table, Tridacnidæ, consists of only eight\r\nor ten species, but it contains the largest of all, the giant Tridacna.\r\nThe historian of the wars of Alexander the Great speaks of oysters\r\ninhabiting the Indian Ocean which were more than a foot long; these were\r\nprobably _Tridacna_, the shells of which were most likely to be seen by\r\nthe Macedonian conquerors. The valves of _Tridacna gigas_ are sometimes\r\nfound a yard and a half in length, and weighing five hundred pounds.\r\nMagnificent examples may be seen in the church of Saint Sulpice, Paris,\r\nwhere they hold the holy water. These beautiful shells were the gift of\r\nthe Venetian Republic to Francis I. Under Louis XIV., the curé Languet\r\nhad them presented to the church of Saint Sulpice, where they are used\r\nas fonts for holy water. Another pair are exhibited in the church of\r\nSaint Eulala, at Montpelier, but much smaller in size. The shells of\r\n_Tridacna_ are formed, as represented in PL. XVII., of three acute\r\nangles, festooned on their edges by broad sides bristling with white\r\nscales. The hinges have two teeth; the ligament is elongated and\r\nexternal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XVII.--Tridacna gigantea, Holy Water Basin in the\r\nChurch of Saint Sulpice at Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe animal of _Tridacna_ is remarkable for its fine colours. _Tridacna\r\nsafrana_ is of a beautiful blue round the edges, rayed through a shade\r\nof very pale blue. More in the interior is a row of small moons of a\r\nyellowish green; the centre is a bright violet, with brownish\r\nlongitudinal punctured lines. \"We have at this moment before our eyes,\"\r\nsay the travellers Quoy and Gaimard, \"one of the most charming\r\nspectacles that can be seen, when at a little depth beneath the surface\r\na number of these animals display the brilliant velvety colours and\r\nvarying shades of their submarine parterres. As we can only perceive the\r\ngaping opening of the valves, we may imagine to ourselves what is its\r\nfirst aspect.\" The mantle of the animal is closed and ample; its edges\r\nare swollen, and reunited in nearly its whole circumference in such a\r\nmanner as to leave only three very small openings--two in the upper\r\npart; the one serves the purpose of discharging the products of\r\ndigestion, the other gives entrance and exit to the water necessary for\r\nrespiratory purposes. The third opening is in the lower part of the\r\nbody, and free; it leaves an opening for the passage of the foot, which\r\nis enormous, and is surrounded with an ample tuft of byssoidal fibres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149. Tridacna squamosa (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150. Tridacna squamosa, on the inside (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nAided by this silky tuft, the animal attaches itself to the rocks, and\r\nsuspends its weighty shell from them. If it is intended to remove those\r\nattached to the sides of the rock, it is necessary to cut the cords of\r\nthe tendonous byssus, by which it is held suspended, with a hatchet.\r\n\r\nAll the species are inhabitants of the Tropical seas. The _Tridacna_\r\n_gigas_ is a native of the Indian Ocean. The flesh, though coriaceous,\r\nand by no means of an agreeable flavour, is a great resource to the poor\r\nIndians. The accompanying representations of _Tridacna squamosa_ (Figs.\r\n149 and 150) will convey a general idea of the genus.\r\n\r\nOur fourteenth family, Hippuritidæ, is entirely fossil; but the\r\nfifteenth, Chamidæ, of which the best example is the rugose genus\r\nCharina, is widely distributed in tropical seas.\r\n\r\nThe very numerous division of shells called Asiphonidæ, possesses\r\nanimals without respiratory siphons. The shells we shall now describe\r\nbelong to the sixteenth family, Unionidæ, which contain Iridina, Anodon,\r\nand Unio.\r\n\r\nThe pond mussels, _Anodon_, are found in lakes, rivers, and seas of\r\nalmost every region of the globe. Their shells are rounded or oval,\r\ngenerally very thin, regular, and equivalve, not gaping, the hinges\r\nwithout teeth, whence their name, from the Greek, ὀδότοϛ, _without\r\nteeth_. These shells are nacred inside, and generally smooth.\r\n\r\nThe _Anodon cygnea_ (Fig. III., PL. XVI.) is broad, deep, and light, and\r\nis sometimes employed for skimming the cream off milk. The genus is\r\ndivided into many groups, the principal forms of which are represented\r\nin PL. XVI.\r\n\r\nThe river mussels, _Unio_, are, like the Anodon, found in the muddy\r\nbottoms of all countries. The animal resembles the Anodon, but the shell\r\npresents a toothed hinge. The lower face of the valve is nacrous, but\r\nshaded with purplish violet, copreous, and iridescent; the anterior face\r\nis of a green colour, which varies from tender to blackish green.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151. Unio littoralis (Cuvier).]\r\n\r\nAmong the species found in European seas may be noted the Rhine mussel,\r\na large species, the nacre of which is employed for ornamental purposes.\r\n_Unio littoralis_ (Cuvier), represented in Fig. 151, and the painter's\r\nmussel, _Unio_ _pictorum_ (Fig. 152), employed in the arts to contain\r\ncertain colours. Those known as the river mussels are leathery, of an\r\ninsipid taste, and scarcely eatable: the finest species are found in the\r\ngreat American rivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.--Anodonta.\r\n\r\n    I.

Linnæus, who\r\nwas aware of the origin of the Pintadine pearls, and of pearls in\r\ngeneral, was also aware of the possibility of producing them\r\nartificially from various molluscs. He suggested bringing together a\r\nnumber of mussels, piercing holes in their shells with an augur in order\r\nto produce a wound, and afterwards leave them for five or six years, to\r\ngive the pearl time to form. The Swedish Government consented to try the\r\nexperiment, and long did so in secret; pearls were produced, but they\r\nwere of no value, and the enterprise was abandoned as unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nScottish pearls were much celebrated in the middle ages, and between the\r\nyears 1761 and 1784 pearls to the value of £10,000 were sent to London\r\nfrom the rivers Tay and Isla; \"and the trade carried on in the\r\ncorresponding years in the present century,\" says Mr. Bertram, \"is far\r\nmore than double that amount.\" The pearl, according to Mr. Bertram, is\r\nfound in a variety of the mussel, which is characterised by the valves\r\nbeing united by a broad hinge, and having a strong fibrous byssus, with\r\nwhich it attaches itself to other shells, to rocks, and other solid\r\nsubstances. \"The pearl fisheries of Scotland,\" he adds, \"may become a\r\nsource of wealth to the people living on the large rivers, if prudently\r\nconducted.\" Mr. Unger, a dealer in gems in Edinburgh, having discerned\r\nthe capabilities of the Scotch pearl as a gem of value, has established\r\na scale of prices which he gives for them, according to their size and\r\nquality; and it is now a fact that the beautiful pearls of our Scottish\r\nstreams are admired beyond the orient pearl. Empresses and queens, and\r\nroyal and noble ladies, have made large purchases of these gems; and Mr.\r\nUnger estimates the sum paid to pearl-finders in the summer of 1864 at\r\n£10,000. The localities successfully fished have been the classic Doon,\r\nthe Forth, the Tay, the Don, the Spey, the Isla, and most of the\r\nHighland rivers of note. Scottish pearls are much whiter in colour than\r\noriental. What tint they have is bluish, while those of the East are\r\nyellowish. Pink pearls are produced by several exotic species of Unio.\r\n\r\nOur seventeenth family are the Trigoniadæ, affording Trigonia, of which\r\nso many occurred in the Jurassic period of Geologic History in the\r\nstrata of Europe, but of which two or three are alone left alive in the\r\nseas of Australia.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth family, the Arcadæ, affords between 200 and 300 species\r\nof the families of Leda, Nucula, Pectunculus, and Arca.\r\n\r\nOf the eighteenth family, Arcadæ, we shall only at present instance\r\nPectunculus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153. Pectunculus aureflua (Reeve).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154. Pectunculus delessertii (Reeve).]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Pectunculus_ are abundant on the shores of the Mediterranean\r\nand along the Atlantic coast. If we take up at hazard a handful of\r\nshells on any part of the French coast, one-third will consist of\r\n_Pectunculus_. They are found mixed with Cardium, Venus, Razor-fish, and\r\nPectens. Their round and robust frame attracts much attention. They form\r\nthe first of those charming infantile collections which are gathered at\r\nthe mother's feet.\r\n\r\nThe animal which inhabits this pretty shell is moulded on its curvature;\r\nlike the shell, it is round and squat; it is furnished with a mouth,\r\nlarge, and thick for its size, and with double branchiæ. When the animal\r\nis taken alive, it sometimes exudes a thick mucous liquid over the\r\nshell, which has disgusted many a young collector with his capture.\r\n\r\nAmong numerous species of _Pectunculus_ we note as worthy of\r\nrepresentation: _P. aureflua_, Reeve (Fig. 153); _P. delessertii_, Reeve\r\n(Fig. 154); _P. pectiniformis_, Lamarck (Fig. 155); and _P. scriptus_,\r\nBorn (Fig. 156).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155. Pectunculus pectiniformis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156. Pectunculus scriptus (Born).]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The term bivalve as constituting a class must be taken in a\r\nlimited sense, for several genera, as pholas for example, have six or\r\nmore valves.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nACEPHALOUS MOLLUSCA--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYTILIDÆ--THE MUSSEL.\r\n\r\n    \"Ecce inter virides jactatur mytilus algas.\"\r\n\r\n    _Anthologia._\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the nineteenth family or Mytilidæ, which includes\r\nMytilus, Modiola, Lithodomus, and Dreissena.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157. Mytilus edulis (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe well-known shell of the mussel (Fig. 157, _Mytilus edulis_) is\r\nlongitudinal, equivalve, and regular, pointed at the base, with capacity\r\nto attach itself by a byssus; the hinge has no teeth, but a deep furrow,\r\nin which the ligament is located. In the genus _Mytilus_ the byssus is\r\ndivided to its base. In _Modiola_ it has a common corneous centre. In\r\n_Pinna_ the anus is furnished with a long angular base. In all these\r\ngenera the foot is small, its retractile muscles numerous, and the\r\nbyssus large. In _Lithodomus_ the byssus is rudimentary; the muscles are\r\nretractile, equal, and two pairs only. In _Unio_, _Cardium_, and\r\n_Hyria_, the foot is large and not byssiferous.\r\n\r\nThe animal, as described by M. Chenu, is elongate, oval, the lobes of\r\nthe mantle simple or fringed, divided at the edge into two leaves, the\r\ninterior being very short, bearing a fringe of small, cylindrical, and\r\nmovable fillets; the exterior leaf is united to the shell very near the\r\nedge. The opening by which water and food are introduced supplies the\r\nbranchiæ at the same time. The stomach consists of a white membrane,\r\nthin, like opaline, and presenting itself in longitudinal folds; the\r\nliver is granulous, composed of greenish grains more or less deep,\r\ncontained in the meshes of a whitish tissue forming a thickish bed,\r\nwhich surrounds the stomach, the intestines taking the direction of the\r\nmedian and dorsal line, and beneath the heart are received and terminate\r\nin a small appendage, floating in the cavity of the mantle near the\r\nhinge. The foot is, perhaps, the remarkable organ of the mussel: it is\r\nsmall, semi-lunar when not in motion, but capable of great elongation,\r\nresembling thus a sort of conical tongue, having a longitudinal furrow\r\non its side. It is put in motion by several pairs of muscles, all of\r\nwhich penetrate and are interlaced with the tissue; behind it is the\r\nsilky byssus. The mouth is large, and furnished with two pairs of soft\r\npalpi, which are pointed and fixed by their summit. Abdominal masses\r\nemanate, and on each side a pair of nearly equal branchiæ. The\r\nadditional muscles, one anterior and small, the other posterior, large,\r\nand rounded. At the base of the foot is a gland which furnishes a\r\nviscous secretion; this viscous liquid is organized and moulded in the\r\ngroove of the foot, and forms a thread, and originates the byssus; it is\r\na bundle of hairs, mane, or thread, which holds on to its shell.\r\n\r\nThe byssus plays an important part in the organization of the mussel.\r\nWhile the oyster remains eternally riveted to its rock, until torn from\r\nit by violence, the mussel moves about, and in this motion the byssus is\r\nan active agent. The mussel attaches its byssus to some fixed object,\r\nand drawing upon it, as upon a line, the shell is displaced. The house\r\nis drawn onwards; the animal is in motion. It takes no great strides,\r\nbut a fraction of an inch satisfies its desires; it is, however, an\r\nadvance upon the oyster, and a lesson in mechanics. The mussel stretches\r\nout its foot, and, at the point chosen, it hooks on a hair of the\r\nbyssus; then, withdrawing the foot suddenly, and hauling on the thread,\r\nthe animal and shell are moved forward. Every time it repeats this\r\nmotion it seems to attach an additional hair, so that at the end of the\r\nfour and twenty hours it has used many inches in length of cordage. In\r\nthe byssus of some mussels we find as many as a hundred and fifty of\r\nthese small threads, with which the animal anchors itself most securely\r\nto the rock. Aided by this cordage, the mussel suspends itself to\r\nvertical rocks, holding on a little above the surface of the water, so\r\nthat the shell is smooth and polished as compared with the coarse and\r\nrugged shell of the oyster.\r\n\r\nThe mussels, like the oysters, are gregarious, and widely diffused over\r\nall European seas. They abound on both sides the Channel, their lower\r\nprice having procured for them the name of \"the poor man's oyster;\" but\r\nit is infinitely less digestible and savoury than its congener.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158. Byssus, mantle, and oviduct.\r\n\r\nA, right lobe of the mantle; D, rectum; G, branchiæ; H, foot; J,\r\nposterior muscle; L, superior tube; O, heart; P, ventricle; Q, auricle;\r\nX, pericardium; _b_, tentacles; _d_, byssus; _e_, gland of the byssus;\r\n_g_, retractile muscle of the foot; _h_, valves of the mantle; _i_,\r\noviduct; _j_, orifice of the excretory organ; _k_, internal ditto.]\r\n\r\nMany of our readers may think that mussels are found on the shore in a\r\nstate of nature, of good size, well flavoured, and fit for the table.\r\nNothing of the kind! Detached from the rocks and cliffs of the sea,\r\nwhere it has been growing in a natural state, it is lean, small, acrid,\r\nand unwholesome food; and it is only when human industry intervenes to\r\nameliorate this child of Nature that it becomes palatable and wholesome\r\nfood. In order to trace the ameliorative process by which the coriaceous\r\nflesh of the mussel was rendered tender, fat, and even savoury, we must\r\nconduct the reader back into the middle ages.\r\n\r\nSome time in 1236 a barque, freighted with sheep and manned by three\r\nIrishmen, came to grief upon the rocks in the creek of Aiguillon, a few\r\nmiles from Rochelle. The neighbouring fishermen who came to the relief\r\nof the crew succeeded with great difficulty in saving the life of the\r\nmaster, a man named Walton. Exiled upon the lonely shore of the Aunis,\r\nwith a few sheep saved from shipwreck, Walton at first supported himself\r\nby hunting sea-fowl, which frequented the shore and neighbouring marshes\r\nin vast flocks. He was a skilful fowler, and invented or adapted a\r\npeculiar kind of net, which he called the _night net_. This consisted of\r\na net some three or four hundred yards in length by three in breadth,\r\nwhich he placed horizontally, like a screen, along the quiet waters of\r\nthe bay, retaining it in its position by means of posts driven into the\r\nmuddy bottom. In the obscurity of the night the wild-fowl, in floating\r\nalong the surface of the waters, would come in contact with the net, and\r\nget themselves entangled in its meshes.\r\n\r\nBut the Bay of Aiguillon was only a vast lake of mud, in which boats\r\nmoved with difficulty; and Walton, having arranged his bird-net, began\r\nto consider what kind of boat would enable him most conveniently to\r\nnavigate the sea of mud. The flat-bottomed, square-sided boat, known in\r\nour rivers as a _punt_, and on the Norman coast as an _acon_, was the\r\nresult. Walton's boat had a wooden frame some three yards long and one\r\nin breadth and depth, the fore part of which sloped down into the water,\r\nin the form of a prow, at a slight angle. In propelling the boat the\r\nrower, who occupied the stern of the punt, knelt on his right knee (as\r\nrepresented in Fig. 159), inclining forward, with one hand on each edge,\r\nand the left leg outside the boat. A vigorous push with the left foot\r\ngave the frail boat an impulse, under which it rapidly traversed the bay\r\nfrom one point to the other.\r\n\r\nThe mussels swarmed in the little bay; and Walton soon remarked that\r\nthey attached themselves by preference to that part of the post a little\r\nabove the mud, and that those so placed soon became fatter, as well as\r\nmore agreeable to the taste, than those buried in the mud. He saw in\r\nthis peculiarity the elements of a sort of mussel culture which might\r\nbecome a new branch of industry. \"The practices he introduced,\" says M.\r\nCoste, \"were so happily adapted to the requirements of the new industry,\r\nthat, after six centuries, they are still the rules by which the rich\r\npatrimony he created for a numerous population is governed. He seems to\r\nhave applied himself to the enterprise, conscious not only of the\r\nservice he was rendering to his contemporaries, but desirous that their\r\ndescendants should remember him, for in every instance he has given to\r\nthe apparatus which he invented the form of his initial letter W. After\r\ndue consideration, Walton began to carry out his design. He planted a\r\nlong range of piles along the low marshy shore, each pair forming a\r\nletter V, the front of the letter being towards the sea, and each limb\r\ndiverging at an angle of forty-five degrees. These posts were driven\r\nabout a yard asunder; they were about twelve feet long, six feet being\r\nabove water, and interlaced with branches wattled together, so as to\r\nform continuous hurdles, each about two hundred yards long, which are\r\ncalled _bouchots_. By the assistance of this apparatus, which\r\nintercepted spat which would otherwise have been swept away to sea by\r\nthe tide, Walton formed a magnificent collection of mussels; but he did\r\nnot abandon his isolated piles. These, being without fascines or\r\nbranches, and always submerged, arrested the spat at the moment of\r\nemission.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159. Punt or Pirogue of the Marsh.]\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this system of culture adopted by the Irish exile were\r\nso obvious that his neighbours along the shore were not slow to imitate\r\nhis example. In a short time the whole bay was covered with similar\r\nbouchots. At the present time these lines of hurdles form a perfect\r\nforest in the little creek. About two hundred and thirty thousand piles\r\nsupport a hundred and twenty-five thousand fascines, which, according to\r\nM. Coste, \"bend all the year under a harvest which a squadron of ships\r\nof the line would fail to float.\" There are about five hundred of these\r\nbouchots in the bay, each from two hundred to two hundred and fifty\r\nyards in length and six feet high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160. Isolated piles covered with the spawn of\r\nmussels.]\r\n\r\nThe isolated piles are without palisades, and are uncovered only at\r\nspring tides. In the months of February and March the spat collected on\r\nthem scarcely equals in size a grain of linseed; by the month of May it\r\nwill be about the size of a split pea; in July, a small haricot bean:\r\nthis is the moment for its transplantation. In this month the\r\n_bouchotiers_, as the men occupied in this culture are called, launch\r\ntheir punts and proceed to the part of the bay where these piles are\r\ndriven. They detach with a hook the agglomerated masses of young\r\nmussels, which they gather in baskets, and carry them to their bouchots.\r\nThese bouchots, that is to say, the piles covered with fascines and\r\nbranches, are of four different heights, forming, so to speak, four\r\nstages, according to the age and growth of the mussel. Each stage\r\nreceives the mollusc suitable to it. In the first stage of its existence\r\nthe mussel cannot endure exposure to the air, and remains constantly\r\nunder water, except at the period of spring tides. These are gathered in\r\nsacks made of old matting, or suspended in interstices of the\r\nbasket-work. \"These immense palisades,\" says M. Coste, \"cover themselves\r\nwith black clusters of mussels developed between the meshes of their\r\ntissues.\" At that time the second rows are cleared away to make room for\r\nyounger generations; the mussels, which no longer dread the air, are\r\ntransported to the more advanced bouchots, which remain above water in\r\nall tides, where they stay till they are fit for market, which usually\r\nhappens after ten or twelve months of culture on the more advanced\r\nbouchots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161. Piles, with basket-work, covered with mussels\r\nin a fit state to be gathered in.]\r\n\r\nBut, in order to prepare for this consummation, they are subjected to a\r\nsecond and even a third remove. There is no longer any danger in\r\nsubjecting them to the air for many hours. From this they pass to a\r\nfourth stage, termed _Amont_ (Fig. 161). From this stage the full-grown\r\nmussel is removed. Under this system of culture the reproduction,\r\nnursing, collecting, and preparing for market, are made simultaneously.\r\nFrom July to January the mussel trade is in full operation, and the\r\nflesh in perfection. From February to April is the close season; their\r\nflesh is then poor and leathery. It is also remarked that those which\r\ninhabit the upper rows of the wicker-work are of a mellower flavour than\r\nthose on the lower ranks, and that the intermediate rows are an\r\nimprovement on those which are buried in the mud, although even these\r\nare preferable to mussels gathered on the sea shore in a state of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nM. Coste gives a graphic description of the manner in which this\r\nindustry is carried on. \"Having supplied the neighbouring villages,\" he\r\nsays, \"for the purpose of supplying the more distant cities, the\r\nbouchotiers land their punts, filled with mussels, which their wives\r\ncarry into grottoes hollowed out of the cliffs; where they clean and\r\npack them in hampers, baskets, and panniers, for conveyance by carts or\r\npack-horses. They depart on their respective journeys at night, so as to\r\nreach their markets at La Rochelle, Rochefort, Surgéres,\r\nSaint-Jean-d'Angely, Angoulême, Niort, Poictiers, Tours, Angers, and\r\nSaumur, at an early hour. A hundred and forty horses and ninety carts\r\nmake upwards of thirty-three thousand journeys annually to these cities.\r\nBesides this, forty or fifty boats come from Bordeaux, the isles of Ré\r\nand Oleron, and from the sands of Olonne, making an aggregate of seven\r\nhundred and fifty voyages per annum, distributing the harvest of the\r\nlittle bay at places where horses could not serve the purpose.\r\n\r\n\"A bouchot, well furnished, supplies annually, according to the length\r\nof its wings, from four to five hundred charges. The charge is a hundred\r\nand fifty kilogrammes (over three hundred pounds), and sells for five\r\nfrancs; a single bouchot thus carries a harvest equal in weight to a\r\nhundred and thirty to a hundred and forty thousand pounds, equal in\r\nvalue to £100; the whole bay probably yielding a gross revenue of\r\n£480,000. This figure, and the abundant harvest which produces it, gives\r\nonly a slight idea of the alimentary resources of the sea shore; and\r\nevery part of the coast, properly adapted for the purpose, could be\r\nturned to equal advantage. In the mean time, the Bay of Aiguillon\r\nremains a monument of what one man may accomplish.\"\r\n\r\nWhile commending the mussel as an important article of food, we must not\r\nconceal the fact, that it has produced in certain persons very grave\r\neffects, showing that for them its flesh has the effects of poison. The\r\nsymptoms, commonly observed two or three hours after the repast, are\r\nweakness or torpor, constriction of the throat and swelling of the head,\r\naccompanied by great thirst, nausea, frequent vomitings, and eruption of\r\nthe skin and severe itching.\r\n\r\nThe cause of these attacks is not very well ascertained; they have in\r\nturn been ascribed to the presence of copper pyrites in the\r\nneighbourhood of the mussel; to certain small crabs which lodge\r\nthemselves as parasites in the shell of the mussel; to the spawn of\r\nstar-fishes or medusæ that the mussel may have swallowed. But, probably,\r\nthe true cause of this kind of poisoning resides in the predisposition\r\nof individuals. The remedy is very simple: an emetic, accompanied by\r\ndrinking plentifully of slightly acidulated beverages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162. Malleus alba (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163. Malleus vulgaris (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nWe have now come to the twentieth family, the Aviculidæ, which contains\r\nAvicula, Malleus, Maleagrina, Perna, and Pinna. The shells of the\r\nHammerheads (_Malleus_) have a rough resemblance to the implement from\r\nwhich they derive their name. The valves are nearly equal, blackish, and\r\nsomewhat wrinkled on the exterior, often brilliantly nacred in the\r\ninterior. They are enlarged to the right and left of the hinge, forming\r\nprolongations on each side, which give them the fancied resemblance to\r\nthe Hammerhead (Fig. 163). At the same time they grow in a direction\r\nopposite to the hinge, which gives something approaching the handle of\r\nthe implement.\r\n\r\nThis is the first feature which a glance at _Malleus alba_ (Fig. 162)\r\nconveys. The hinge is without teeth, having instead a deep conical\r\nfossette or dimple, for the reception of a very strong ligament which\r\nacts upon the valves. The animal is contained in the interior of the\r\nshell, its mantle fringed by very small tentacular appendages. Only six\r\nactually living species of the genera are known, which are inhabitants\r\nof the Indian Ocean, of the Australian seas, and the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful diaphanous nacre which embellishes the interior of so many\r\nornamental cabinets are principally produced by the animal inhabiting\r\nthe _Meleagrina_, a bivalve, sometimes designated the _pintadine_, or\r\nmother-of-pearl shell. This bivalve moors itself to the bottom of the\r\nsea by a strong byssus of a brownish colour. The door-posts of the\r\nshells are irregularly rounded in their young days; they are externally\r\nlightly foliated, and ornamented with bands of green and white, which\r\nspring from the summit in rays, and afterwards break off into two or\r\nthree slightly scattered branches. In old age they become rugged and\r\nblackish. The shell is in its perfection when about eight or ten years\r\nold, their size being then about six inches in diameter, with a\r\nthickness of about an inch and a quarter.\r\n\r\nNacre is the hard and brilliant substance with which the valves of\r\ncertain shells are lined in the interior. This substance is white,\r\nsilky, slightly azure, and more or less iridescent. Most of the bivalves\r\nare supplied with nacre; some of them even yield a blue, or blue and\r\nviolet pigment. The iridescent _Haliotis iris_, for instance, is an\r\nemerald-greenish blue of changing colour, with reflections of a purple\r\nviolet. _Turbo argyrostomus_ (Linnæus) presents a mouth of bright\r\nsilvery hue, while _Turbo chrysostomus_ appears in all the glory of\r\ngold; but the Pintadine yields the purest white nacre, as well as the\r\nmost uniform, and especially the thickest. This product owes its\r\nbrilliant and delicate appearance to the play of light on it in its\r\nhighly-polished state. For practical purposes the nacre is separated\r\nfrom the shell with an instrument; sometimes all the exterior part of\r\nthe shell being dissolved away from the precious substance, leaving only\r\nthe naked bed of nacre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164. Meleagrina margaritifera (Linnæus).\r\n\r\n    Outside of the shell.\r\n    Inside of the shell.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165. Meleagrina margaritifera (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting of all the nacre-bearing shells is the pearl\r\noyster (_Meleagrina margaritifera_), the exterior, as well as the\r\ninterior, of which is represented in Fig. 164. The interior of the shell\r\naffords the most exquisite pearls; the Esterhazy collection of jewels\r\nafforded many such specimens. This shell is nearly round, and greenish\r\nin colour on the outside; it furnishes at once the finest pearls, under\r\nfavourable circumstances, and the nacre so useful in many industrial\r\narts. Fine pearls and nacre have, in short, the same origin. The nacre\r\ninvests the whole interior of the shell of _Meleagrina margaritifera_;\r\nbeing the same secretion which in the pearl has assumed the globular\r\nform: in one state it is deposited as nacre on the walls of the bivalve,\r\nin the other as a pearl in the fleshy interior of the animal. This nacre\r\nis therefore at once a calcareous and horny matter, which the animal\r\nsecretes, and which it attaches to the interior walls of the shell\r\nduring the several periods of its development. Pearls are formed of the\r\nsame substance, only in place of being deposited upon the valves in\r\nbeds, the material is condensed and agglomerated in small spheroids,\r\nwhich develop themselves either on the surface of the valves or in the\r\nfleshy part of the mollusc. Between nacre and pearls, therefore, there\r\nis only the difference of the form of deposition. Fig. 165 represents\r\nthe pearl oyster with calcareous concretions in various states of\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe finest pearls--solidified drops of dew, as the Orientals term them\r\nin the language of poetry--are secretions supposed to be the result of\r\ndisease in the animal. The matter, in place of being spread over the\r\nsurface of the valves in their beds, is condensed either on the centre\r\nof the valves or in the interior of the organ, and forms a more or less\r\nrounded body. The pearls, when deposited on the valves, are generally\r\nadherent; those which originate in the body of the animal are always\r\nfree. Generally we find some small foreign body in their centre which\r\nhas served as a nucleus to the concretion, the body being perhaps a\r\nsterile egg of the mollusc, the egg of a fish, a rounded animalcule, a\r\ngrain of sand even, round which has been deposited in concentric layers\r\nthe beautiful and much-prized gem.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, and other Eastern nations, are said to turn this fact in\r\nthe natural history of bivalves to practical use in making pearls and\r\ncameos. By introducing into the mantle of the mollusc, or into the\r\ninterior of a living valve, a round grain of sand, glass, or metal, they\r\ninduce a deposit which in time yields a pearl, in the one case free, and\r\nin the other adhering to the shell. In some cases they are said to be\r\nproduced in whole chaplets by the insertion of grains of quartz\r\nconnected by a string into the mantle of a species of _Symphynota_; in\r\nother cases, a dozen enamelled figures of Buddha seated have been\r\nproduced by inserting small plates of embossed metal in the valves of\r\nthe same species.\r\n\r\nThe pearls are very small at first; they increase by annual layers\r\ndeposited on the original nucleus, their brilliancy and shade of colour\r\nvarying with that of the nacre from which they are produced. Sometimes\r\nthey are diaphanous, silky, lustrous, and more or less iridescent;\r\noccasionally they turn out dull, obscure, and even smoky.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pearl oyster is met with in very different latitudes; they are found\r\nin the Persian Gulf, on the Arabian coast, and in Japan, in the American\r\nseas, and on the shores of California, and in the islands of the South\r\nSea; but the most important fisheries are found in the Bay of Bengal,\r\nCeylon, and other parts of the Indian Ocean. The Ceylon fisheries are\r\nunder Government inspection, and each year, before the fisheries\r\ncommence, an official inspection of the coast takes place. Sometimes the\r\nfishing is undertaken on account of the State, at other times it is let\r\nto parties of speculators. In 1804 the pearl fishery was granted to a\r\ncapitalist for £120,000; but, to avoid impoverishing all the beds at\r\nonce, the same part of the gulf is not fished every year.\r\n\r\nThe great fishery for mother-of-pearl Pintadines (_Meleagrina\r\nmargaritifera_) takes place in the Gulf of Manaar, a large bay to the\r\nnorth-east of the island; it commences in the month of February or\r\nMarch, and continues thirty days, taken collectively, and occupies two\r\nhundred and fifty boats, which come from different parts of the coast;\r\nthey reach the ground at daybreak, the time being indicated by a signal\r\ngun. Each boat's crew consists of twenty hands, and a negro. The rowers\r\nare ten in number. The divers divide themselves into two groups of five\r\nmen each, who labour and rest alternately; they descend from forty to\r\nfifty feet, seventy being the very utmost they can accomplish, and\r\neighty seconds the longest period the best divers can remain under\r\nwater, the ordinary period being only thirty seconds. In order to\r\naccelerate their descent, a large stone is attached to a rope. According\r\nto travellers the oars are used to rig out a stage, across which planks\r\nare laid over both sides of the boat; to this stage the diving-stone is\r\nsuspended. This stone is in the form of a pyramid, weighing about\r\nhalf-a-hundredweight; the cord which sustains it sometimes carries in\r\nits lower parts a sort of stirrup to receive the foot of the diver. At\r\nthe moment of his descent he places his right foot in this stirrup, or,\r\nwhere there is no such provision, he rests it on the stone with the cord\r\nbetween his toes. In his left foot he holds the net which is to receive\r\nthe bivalves; then, seizing with his right hand a signal-cord\r\nconveniently arranged for his purpose, and pressing his nostrils with\r\nthe left hand, he dives, holding himself vertically, and balancing\r\nhimself over his foot.\r\n\r\nEach diver is naked, except the band of calico which surrounds the\r\nloins. Having reached the bottom, he withdraws his foot from the stone,\r\nwhich ascends immediately to the stage. The diver throws himself on his\r\nface, and begins to gather all the pintadines within his reach, placing\r\nthem in his net. When he wishes to ascend he pulls the signal cord, and\r\nis drawn up with all possible expedition.\r\n\r\nA good diver, we have said, seldom remains more than thirty seconds\r\nunder water at one time; but he repeats the operation three or four,\r\nand, in favourable circumstances, even fifteen or twenty times. The\r\nlabour is extremely severe. On returning to the boat they sometimes\r\ndischarge water tinged with blood by the mouth, nose, and ears. They are\r\nalso exposed to great danger from sharks, which lie in wait for and\r\nfrequently devour the unhappy divers.\r\n\r\nThey continue to fish till mid-day, when a second gun gives the signal\r\nto cease. The proprietors wait on shore for their boats, in order to\r\nsuperintend their discharge, which must take place before night sets in,\r\nin order to prevent concealment and robbery.\r\n\r\nIn past times the Ceylon fisheries were very valuable. In 1797 they are\r\nsaid to have produced £144,000, and in 1798 as much as £192,000. In 1802\r\nthe fisheries were farmed for £120,000; but for many years the banks\r\nhave been less productive, and are now said to yield only the sum of\r\n£20,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the Bay of Bengal, those of the Chinese coast, of Japan,\r\nand the Indian Archipelago, all abandon themselves to the pearl fishery,\r\nthe produce being estimated to realize at least £800,000. Fisheries\r\nanalogous to those of Ceylon take place on the Persian coast, on the\r\nArabian Gulf, along the coast of Muscat, and in the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nIn these countries the pearl fishing does not commence till the months\r\nof July and August, the sea being at that time calmer than in other\r\nmonths of the year. Arrived on their fishing-ground, the fishermen range\r\ntheir barques at a proper distance from each other, and cast anchor in\r\nwater from eight to nine fathoms deep. The process is pursued here in a\r\nvery simple manner. When about to descend the divers pass a cord, the\r\nextremity of which communicates with a bell placed in the barque, under\r\nthe armpits; they put cotton in their ears, and press the nostrils\r\ntogether with a piece of wood or horn; they close their mouths\r\nhermetically, attach a heavy stone to their feet, and at once sink to\r\nthe bottom of the sea, where they gather indiscriminately all shells\r\nwithin their reach, which they throw into a bag suspended round the\r\nhaunches. When they require to breathe they sound the bell, and\r\nimmediately they are assisted in their ascent.\r\n\r\nOn the oyster-banks off the Isle of Bahrein the pearl fishery produces\r\nabout £240,000; and if we add to this the addition furnished by the\r\nother fisheries of the neighbourhood, the sum total yielded by the\r\nArabian coast would probably not fall short of £350,000.\r\n\r\nIn South America similar fisheries exist. Before the Mexican conquest\r\nthe pearl fisheries were located between Acapulco and the Gulf of\r\nTehuantepec; subsequently they were established round the Islands of\r\nCubagua, Margarita, and Panama. The results became so full of promise\r\nthat populous cities were not slow to raise themselves round these\r\nseveral places.\r\n\r\nUnder the reign of Charles V., America sent to Spain pearls valued at\r\n£160,000; in the present day they are estimated to be worth £60,000. In\r\nthe places mentioned, the divers descend into the sea quite naked; they\r\nremain there from twenty-five to thirty seconds, during which space they\r\ncan only secure two or three pintadines. They dive in this way a dozen\r\ntimes in succession, which gives an average of between thirty and forty\r\nbivalves to each diver.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bivalve is carried on shore, and piled up on mats of Espartero\r\ngrass. The mollusc dies, and soon becomes decomposed; it requires ten\r\ndays to be thoroughly disorganized. When in a thoroughly corrupt state,\r\nthey are thrown into reservoirs of sea-water, when they are opened,\r\nwashed, and handed over to the dealers. The valves furnish _nacre_, and\r\nthe parenchyma the _pearls_.\r\n\r\nThe valves are cleansed, and piled up in tuns or casks; by raising their\r\nexternal surface plates of nacre are obtained more or less thick,\r\naccording to the age of the mollusc.\r\n\r\nNacre of three kinds are distinguishable in commerce: silver-faced,\r\nbastard white, and bastard black. The first are sold in cases of two\r\nhundred and fifty to two hundred and eighty pounds; they are brought\r\nfrom the Indies, from China, and Peru. The ships of various nations\r\nimport these shells as ballast. The second is delivered in casks of two\r\nhundred and fifty pounds weight; it is a yellowish white, and sometimes\r\ngreenish; sometimes red, blue, and green.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPearls form by far the most important product of the animal. When they\r\nare adherent to the valves they are detached with pincers; but,\r\nhabitually, they are found in the parenchyma of the animal. In this case\r\nthe substance is boiled, and afterwards sifted, in order to obtain the\r\nmost minute of the pearls; for those of considerable size are sometimes\r\noverlooked in the first operation. Months after the mollusc is\r\nputrified, miserable Indians may be observed busying themselves with the\r\ncorrupt mass, in search of small pearls which may have been overlooked\r\nby the workmen.\r\n\r\nThe pearls adherent to the valve are more or less irregular in their\r\nshape; they are sold by weight. Those found in the body of the animal,\r\nand isolated, are called _virgin pearls_, or _paragons_. They are\r\nglobular, ovoid, or pyriform, and are sold by the individual pearl. In\r\ncleaning them, they are gathered together in a heap in a bag and worked\r\nwith powdered nacre, in order to render them perfectly pure in colour\r\nand round in shape, and give them a polish; finally, they are passed\r\nthrough a series of copper sieves, in order to size them. These sieves,\r\nto the number of twelve, are made so as to be inserted one within the\r\nother, each being pierced with holes, which determine the size of the\r\npearl and the commercial number which is to distinguish it. Thus, the\r\nsieve No. 20 is pierced with twenty holes, No. 50 with fifty holes, and\r\nso on up to No. 1000, which is pierced with that number of holes. The\r\npearls which are retained in Nos. 20 to 80, said to be _mill_, are\r\npearls of the first order. Those which pass and are retained between\r\nNos. 100 to 800 are _vivadoe_, or pearls of the second order; and those\r\nwhich pass through all the others and are retained in No. 1000 belong to\r\nthe class _tool_, or seed pearls, and are of the third order.\r\n\r\nThey are afterwards threaded; the small and medium-sized pearls on white\r\nor blue silk, arranged in rows, and tied with ribbon into a top-knot of\r\nblue or red silk, in which condition they are exposed for sale in rows,\r\nassorted according to their colours and quality. The small or seed\r\npearls are sold by measure or weight.\r\n\r\nIn America the bivalve is opened with a knife, like the common edible\r\noyster, and the pearl is obtained by breaking up the mollusc between the\r\nfinger and thumb without waiting for its decomposition; nor is it\r\nboiled. This is a much longer and less certain process than that pursued\r\nin the East; but the pearls are preserved in greater freshness by the\r\nprocess--for the nacre of the dead shells is less brilliant than that of\r\nthose which have been suddenly killed, and at once separated from the\r\nsoft parts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome few pearls have become historical, from their size and beauty. A\r\npearl from Panama, in the form of a pear, and about the size of a\r\npigeon's egg, was presented in 1579 to Philip II., King of Spain: it was\r\nvalued at £4000. A Lady of Madrid possessed an American pearl in 1605\r\nvalued at 31,000 ducats.\r\n\r\nThe Pope Leo X. purchased a pearl of a Venetian jeweller for £14,000.\r\nAnother was presented to the Sultan Soliman the Great by the Venetian\r\nRepublic valued at £16,000. Julius Cæsar, who was a great admirer of\r\npearls, presented one to Servilia which was valued at a million of\r\nsesterces, about £48,000 of our money.\r\n\r\nThere is no data for the volume or value of the two famous pearls of\r\nCleopatra; one of these which the queen is said to have capriciously\r\ndissolved in vinegar and drank--Heavens preserve us from such a\r\ndraught!--is said by some authors to have been worth £60,000; the other\r\nwas divided into two parts, and suspended one half from each ear of the\r\nCapitoline Venus. Another pearl was purchased at Califa by the traveller\r\nTavernier, and is said to have been sold by him to the Shah of Persia\r\nfor the enormous price of £180,000.\r\n\r\nA prince of Muscat possessed a pearl so extremely valuable--not on\r\naccount of its size, for it was only twelve carats, but because it was\r\nso clear and transparent that daylight was seen through it--he refused\r\n£4000 for it.\r\n\r\nIn the Zozema Museum at Moscow there is a pearl, called the \"Pilgrim,\"\r\nwhich is quite diaphanous; it is globular in form, and weighs nearly\r\ntwenty-four carats. It is said that the pearl in the crown of Rudolph\r\nII. weighed thirty carats, and was as large as a pear. This size,\r\nbesides being indefinite, is more than doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe shahs of Persia actually possess a string of pearls, each individual\r\nof which is nearly the size of a hazel nut. The value of this string of\r\njewels is inestimable.\r\n\r\nAt the Paris Exposition of 1855, Her Majesty the Queen exhibited some\r\nmagnificent pearls; and on the same occasion the Emperor of the French\r\nexhibited a collection of 408 pearls, each weighing over nine\r\npennyweights, all of perfect form and of the finest water. The Romans\r\nwere passionately fond of pearls, and they have transmitted their taste\r\nto the Eastern nations, who attach notions of great grandeur and wealth\r\nto the possessor of large and brilliant pearls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe genus _Pinna_, so called by Linnæus, from one of the species which\r\nwas so designated from the resemblance of its byssus to the aigrette or\r\nplumelet which the Roman soldiers attached to the helmet. French\r\nnaturalists name them _jambonneau_, from their singular resemblance to a\r\ndried ham (Figs. 166 and 167), their brown, smoky colour not a little\r\naiding the resemblance. This shell is fibrous, horny, very thin and\r\nfragile, compressed, regular, and equivalve, triangularly pointed in\r\nfront, round or truncated behind. The hinge is linear, straight, and\r\nwithout teeth; the ligament, in great part internal, occupies more than\r\nhalf the anterior half of the dorsal edge of the shell, forming a\r\nstraight elongated fossette.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166. Pinna rudis (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167. Pinna nigrina (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe animal is thick, elongated, with mantle open behind, presenting a\r\nconical furrowed foot, hearing a considerable byssus.\r\n\r\nThe _Pinnæ_ are found in almost every sea, and at various depths; they\r\nare constantly attached by their byssus, and in a vertical position, the\r\nlarger side of their shell being uppermost. They assemble on sandy\r\nbottoms in considerable numbers. The byssus has in all ages fixed the\r\nattention of the Mediterranean fishermen upon these curious shells. With\r\nits tuft of fine silky hairs, six or seven inches in length, of a fine\r\nreddish-brown hue, articles of luxury are formed, which are often\r\nmentioned by the Latin writers. The threads of the byssus, which are\r\nremarkable for their unalterable colour, were formed by both Greeks and\r\nRomans into a fabric to which there is nothing analogous in the world.\r\nThe Maltese and Neapolitans still fashion soft tissues from it, but the\r\nstuffs so manufactured are pure objects of curiosity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168. Pinna bullata (Swainson).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169. Pinna nobilis, with its byssus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nTwelve species are described as living in the several seas. _Pinna\r\nnobilis_ (Fig. 169), the byssus of which was employed in the ancient\r\nNeapolitan industry, inhabits the shores of the Mediterranean. _Pinna\r\nbullata_, Swainson (Fig. 168), is also a well-known species.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTREIDÆ.\r\n\r\nOur twenty-first family, Ostreidæ, contains Lima, Spondylus, Pecten,\r\nAnomia, and the all-important oyster. The common oyster, _Ostrea\r\nedulis_, is found in all seas. It is unequally valved, modified in shape\r\nby the form of the submarine body to which it happens to be attached.\r\nThe lower or adherent valve is concave, always the largest; the upper\r\none thin, usually flat; the shell is lamellar, rough externally, and\r\nseems to be composed of broken layers, adhering slightly to each other,\r\nas if the successive layers had been built up from within, and each\r\nsucceeding layer was an enlargement upon its predecessor. The hinge\r\nwhich unites the valves is an elastic toothless ligament placed behind\r\nthe centre, which opens the valves.\r\n\r\nThe interior surface of the valves is smooth and white, diaphanous or\r\npearly towards the centre, but near the back an oval or rounded\r\nimpression may be observed, to which a thick and whitish fleshy body is\r\nattached. This is the central muscle which draws the valves together,\r\nhermetically closing them upon the animal. This muscle is cut through in\r\nthe process of opening the oyster.\r\n\r\nThe animal has no power of locomotion; its foot is very small and often\r\nwanting, no syphon, but lies with its mouth open, and slightly attached\r\nto the shell. The shell itself is always adherent, as if soldered to the\r\nrock or other submarine body, the point of adherence being near the\r\nsummit of the lower valve, at the part called the _heel_.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the oyster opened by the double dissection of the\r\nligament of the central muscle and of the abductor valves. When\r\ndisplayed before our eyes, we see in the bottom of the shell a\r\nflattened, shapeless animal, semi-transparent, greyish, and somewhat\r\noval-shaped. The gastronomist, who seldom sees beyond his nose, thinks\r\nthat in spite of its culinary merits the oyster belongs to the lowest\r\nrank of animal existence; but he deceives himself, and does not know how\r\ncomplex and delicate is the organization of the humble bivalve. The\r\nanimal is enveloped in a sort of smooth, thin, contractile tissue called\r\nthe _mantle_, which folds round it, presenting two lobes, separated on\r\nthe greatest part of its circumference, and forming a sort of hood, the\r\nsummit of which abuts upon the hinge of the bivalve. The edges of this\r\nmantle are fringed with very small cilia, which the creature can extend\r\nand draw back at pleasure, and which seem to be gifted with a certain\r\namount of sensibility. It is this mantle which secretes and deposits the\r\ncalcareous matter which forms the shell, each plate of which is an\r\nenlargement on the preceding one, until it constitutes a pyramid of thin\r\nconvex lamellæ.\r\n\r\nAt the point where the lobes of the mantle meet, near the summit of the\r\nvalve, is the mouth of the animal, with its thin membranous lips. This\r\norgan is large and dilatable, and is accompanied by four flat triangular\r\npieces, by means of which the animal introduces its food into the\r\nstomachal cavity.\r\n\r\nA very short gullet is attached to the mouth, which leads to a\r\npear-shaped stomach. After this stomach comes a slender sinuous\r\nintestine, which, leading obliquely towards the interior, descends a\r\nlittle, then reascends, passes behind the stomachal cavity, nearly on a\r\nlevel with the mouth, crossing its first path in order to reach the\r\nposterior face of the adductor muscle, in the centre of which it\r\nterminates with a free opening. The stomach and intestines are\r\nsurrounded on all sides by the liver, which alone constitutes a notable\r\nportion of the mass of organs. This liver is of a blackish colour,\r\npervaded with a deep yellow liquid, which is the bile. Thus the stomach\r\nand intestines of the oyster are surrounded by the _liver_; the mouth is\r\nconnected with the stomach, and the intestines open in the back.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the oyster is placed under the liver, and is surrounded\r\nclosely by the terminal part of the intestines. It is composed, like the\r\nsame organ in the superior animal, of two distinct cavities, an auricle\r\nand ventricle. From the ventricle issues a vessel, which is divided into\r\nthree distinct canals. One of these carries the blood towards the mouth\r\nand tentacles; another carries it towards the liver; the last\r\ndistributes the nourishing fluid to the rest of the body. The blood of\r\nthe oyster is limpid and colourless; it passes successively from the\r\nauricle of the heart, where it is vivified, into the ventricle, and from\r\nthis last cavity into the great vessel of which we spoke, which\r\ndistributes it into the interior of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe oyster thus possesses a true circulation; not that double system\r\nwhich characterises the mammals, and which includes arterial and\r\npulmonary action, but a simple circulation, as it exists in fishes and\r\nmany other animals. It breathes also in the bottom of the water, after\r\nthe manner of fishes, being, like the fish, provided with organs called\r\ngills or _branchiæ_, whose function is to separate the oxygen dissolved\r\nin the water from its other ingredients; these branchiæ, which are\r\nplaced under the mantle, consist of a double series of very delicate\r\ncanals, placed close together, not unlike the teeth of a fine comb.\r\n\r\nHaving no head, the oyster can have no brain; the nerves originate near\r\nthe mouth, where a great ganglion is visible, whence issues a pair of\r\nnerves which distribute themselves in the regions of the stomach and\r\nliver, terminating in a second ganglion, situated behind the liver. The\r\nfirst nervous branch distributes its sensibility to the mouth and\r\ntentacles; the second, to the respiratory branchiæ.\r\n\r\nWith organs of the senses oysters are unprovided. Condemned to a\r\nsedentary life, riveted to a rock where they have been rooted, as it\r\nwere, in their infancy, they neither see nor hear; touch appears to be\r\ntheir only sense, and that is placed in the tentacles of the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe mode of reproduction in these creatures is very peculiar. The oyster\r\nunites in itself the functions of both sexes. In the same organ are\r\nfound the eggs--called _spat_--and the mobile corpuscles intended to\r\nfertilize them.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are yellowish in colour, and exist in prodigious numbers in\r\neach individual. We are assured that an oyster may carry as many as two\r\nmillions of eggs! Nature always makes ample provision for the\r\npreservation of species; but in spite of the most ample provision here\r\ndisplayed, man, in his reckless and wasteful gluttony, has all but\r\ndefeated Nature. A tyro can compute how many individuals a bank of\r\noysters reckoned at twenty thousand would produce, at the rate of two\r\nmillions, or eight hundred thousand, as other authorities assert, from\r\neach one annually, and it will amount to an incredible number--in fact,\r\neach would multiply itself by millions in three years; and yet, thanks\r\nto our improvident management, they get scarcer every year.\r\n\r\nThe spawning season is usually from the month of June to the end of\r\nSeptember: during this season the oysters deposit their eggs in the\r\nfolds of the mantle. During the period of incubation the eggs remain\r\nsurrounded by mucous matter, which is necessary to their development,\r\nthe whole having the appearance of a thick cream--this milky appearance\r\nbeing due to the accumulated mass of ova surrounded by the mucus: this\r\nmass undergoes various changes of colour while losing its fluidity,\r\nbecoming successively yellowish, greyish, brown, and violet, a condition\r\nwhich indicates the near termination of the embryo state, for the\r\noysters do not, like many other inhabitants of the sea, leave their ova;\r\nthey incubate them in the folds of their mantle, and only discharge them\r\nwhen they can live without the maternal protection. Nothing is more\r\ncurious to witness than a bank of oysters at the spawning season. Every\r\nadult individual of which it is composed throws out its phalanx of\r\nprogeny. A living dust is seen to exhale from the oyster bank, troubling\r\nthe water and giving it a thick cloudy appearance, which disseminates\r\nitself little by little in the liquid, until it dissipates and loses\r\nitself far from its focus of production. The _spat_ is soon scattered\r\nfar and wide by the waves; and unless the young oyster finds some solid\r\nbody to which it can attach itself, it falls an inevitable victim to the\r\nlarger animals which prey upon it. In this its infant state, when it\r\nhas just left the protection of the parent shell, the microscope reveals\r\nthe young bivalve, with its shell perfect, having an apparatus which is\r\nalso a swimming _pad_, ready to adhere to the first solid body which the\r\ncurrent drives it against. This pad or cushion (which is represented in\r\nFig. 170) is furnished with vibratile cilia, disposed round the young\r\nshell. Aided by the powerful adductor muscles, with which it is also\r\nprovided, this cushion is projected through the water at the will of the\r\nyoung inhabitant, which has every facility for the purpose: it is even\r\nsaid to swim about near the mother, before final dismissal from the\r\nmaternal protection, seeking shelter at the least alarm between the\r\nvalves of the parent shell. The pad disappears after the young oyster\r\nhas finally attached itself to a permanent bed of its own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170. Young Oysters furnished with locomotive\r\norgans.]\r\n\r\nBefore this period of its life arrives, however, many are the dangers to\r\nwhich it is exposed: its enemies are numerous; they lie in ambush for it\r\nin every cranny! It has to guard itself against eddies and currents,\r\nwhich would drive it out to sea, and mud banks, in which it would be\r\nsmothered. Crustaceans, worms, and polyps, with other equally voracious\r\nmarine inhabitants, prey upon it. Last, but not least, come the terrible\r\nand multiplied engines of the eager fisherman--and we readily comprehend\r\nwhy the oyster is provided with such accumulated masses of ova.\r\n\r\nIf the young bivalve is fortunate enough to escape all the snares and\r\ndangers we have enumerated, it grows rapidly. It is quite microscopic at\r\nthe period of its discharge from the parent shell; at one month it is of\r\nthe size of a large pea, at the end of six months it is about\r\nthree-quarters of an inch, a year after its birth an inch and a half to\r\ntwo inches, and finally, at the end of three years it has become\r\nmerchandise; that is to say, it is in a state to be sent to the parks\r\nfor preservation and feeding. In Fig. 171 we see a group of oysters,[9]\r\nof various ages, attached to a piece of wood: A being oysters of twelve\r\nto fifteen months, B five or six months, C three to four months, D one\r\nto two months, and E oysters twenty days after birth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171. Groups of Oysters of different ages attached to\r\na block of wood.]\r\n\r\nThe species of oysters usually eaten are the common oyster (_Ostrea\r\nedulis_, Linn.) of our own coasts and the opposite shore, and the\r\nhorsefoot oyster (_O. hippopus_, Linn.). On the Mediterranean coast are\r\nthe rose-coloured oyster (_O. rosacea_, Favanue), and the milky oyster\r\n(_O. lacteola_, Moquin-Tandon), besides the small and little-known\r\ncrested oyster (_O. cristata_, Born), and the folded oyster (_O.\r\nplicata_, Chemnitz). On the Corsican coast is the oyster called foliate\r\n(_O. lamellosa_, Brocchi).\r\n\r\nThere are two principal varieties of the common oyster dredged on the\r\nFrench coast, which differ in size and delicacy of flavour. These are\r\nthe Cancale and Ostend oyster. When the first has been fed for some time\r\nin the oyster park, and has assumed its greenish hue, it is designated\r\nthe Marenna oyster, from \"the park\" so named in the Bay of Seudre. Of\r\nthis green colour we shall speak elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWho believed Uncle Jack when he told us in our youth of oysters growing\r\non trees, and oysters so large that they required to be carved like a\r\nround of beef--of oysters on the Coromandel coast as large as\r\nsoup-plates? Nevertheless Uncle Jack's stories were true: there are\r\noysters which require carving, and oysters have been plucked off trees.\r\nIn some parts of America they grow very large. Virginia possesses nearly\r\ntwo million acres of oyster-beds. The sea-board of Georgia is famed for\r\nits immense supplies; the whole coast of Long Island, extending to a\r\nhundred and fifteen miles, is occupied with them, and all over the\r\nStates evidence is to be seen of the estimate in which the favoured\r\nbivalve is held by the American people.\r\n\r\nNatural oyster-beds are found in bays, estuaries, and other sheltered\r\nsinuosities of the coast, with shelving and not too rocky bottoms, such\r\nplaces being, according to the natural law of production, favourable for\r\nthe increase of the colony. Such banks abound in every sea. In France\r\nthe oyster-beds of Rochelle, of Rochefort, the Isles of Ré and Oleron,\r\nthe Bay of St. Brieuc, of Cancale, and Granville, are famous for the\r\nquality of their produce.\r\n\r\nOn the Danish coast there are from forty to fifty oyster-banks, situated\r\non the west coast of Schleswig; the best bed lying between the small\r\nisles of Sylt, Amron, Fohr, Pelworm, and Nordstrand. At the point of\r\nJutland, and opposite Shagen, beds less productive are found.\r\n\r\nThe great oyster-beds of England extend from Gravesend, in the estuary\r\nof the Thames and Medway, along the Kentish coast on the one hand, and\r\nthe estuary of the Colne and other rivers on the Essex coast. The Frith\r\nof Forth is also famous for its oyster-beds, extending from Preston\r\nPans far up the estuary of the river; but, curiously enough, all these\r\ngreat banks, without exception, have been impoverished, and all but\r\nexhausted, by improvident dredging, in spite of the \"close season\" which\r\nhas always existed.[10]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"He was a bold man who first ate an oyster,\" has been said before. The\r\nname of the courageous individual has not been recorded, but Mr.\r\nBertram, in his \"Harvest of the Sea,\" tells us a legend concerning him:\r\n\"Once upon a time,\"--it must have been a long time ago,--\"a man of\r\nmelancholy mood was walking by the shores of a picturesque estuary,\r\nlistening to the monotonous murmur of the sad sea-waves, when he espied\r\na very old and ugly oyster-shell all coated over with parasites and\r\nsea-weeds. It was so unprepossessing that he kicked it with his foot,\r\nand the animal, astonished at receiving such rude treatment on its own\r\ndomain, gaped wide with indignation, preparatory to closing its bivalve\r\nstill more tightly. Seeing the beautiful cream-coloured layers that\r\nshone within the shelly covering, and fancying that the interior of the\r\nshell itself must be beautiful, he lifted up the aged 'native' for\r\nfurther examination, inserting his finger and thumb within the valves.\r\nThe irate mollusc, thinking, no doubt, that this was meant as a further\r\ninsult, snapped its pearly door down upon his finger, causing him\r\nconsiderable pain. After releasing his wounded digit, our inquisitive\r\ngentleman very naturally put it in his mouth. 'Delightful!' exclaimed\r\nhe, opening wide his eyes; 'what is this?' and again he sucked his\r\nfinger. Then the great truth flashed upon him that he had found out a\r\nnew delight--had, in fact, achieved the most important discovery ever\r\nmade. He proceeded at once to realize the thought. With a stone he\r\nopened the oyster's stronghold, and gingerly tried a piece of the\r\nmollusc itself. 'Delicious!' he exclaimed; and there and then, with no\r\nother condiment than its own juice, with no accompaniment of foaming\r\nbrown stout or pale Chablis to wash it down, no newly-cut, well-buttered\r\nbrown bread, did that solitary anonymous man inaugurate the first oyster\r\nbanquet.\"\r\n\r\nAnother story makes the act of eating the first oyster a punishment. The\r\npoetaster also had his views on the subject:\r\n\r\n    \"The man had sure a palate covered o'er\r\n    With brass, or steel, that on the rocky shore\r\n    First broke the oozy oyster's pearly coat,\r\n    And risked the living morsel down his throat.\"\r\n\r\nAnd ever since men have gone on eating oysters. Emperors and poets,\r\nprinces and priests, pontiffs and statesmen, orators and painters, have\r\nfeasted on the favoured bivalve.\r\n\r\nMan has made use of the oyster from the most remote antiquity. Among the\r\ndébris of festivals which precede by ages the epoch of written history,\r\noyster-shells are found. On the \"midden heaps\" of northern Europe they\r\nare often discovered, mingling with other rubbish and with stone\r\nimplements, evidently the refuse of very ancient feasts. We have all\r\nread of the classic feasts of the Romans, which began with oysters\r\nbrought from fabulous distances. Vitellius ate oysters all day long, and\r\nthe idea prevailed that he could eat a thousand. Calisthenes, the\r\nphilosopher, was a passionate oyster eater; so was Caligula; Seneca the\r\nwise could eat his hundred, and the great Cicero did not despise the\r\nsavoury bivalve. Lucullus had sea-water brought to his villa from the\r\nshores of the Campania, in which he bred them in great abundance for the\r\nuse of his guests. To another Roman, Sergius Orata, we owe the original\r\nidea of the oyster-park. He invented the oyster-pond, in which he bred\r\noysters, not for his own table, but for profit.\r\n\r\nAmong modern celebrities whose love of oysters is recorded, we may\r\nmention Louis XI., who feasted the learned doctors of the Sorbonne once\r\na year on oysters. Another Louis invested his cook with an order of\r\nnobility, in reward for his skill in cooking them. Cervantes loved\r\noysters, although he satirized oyster dealers. Marshal Turgot used to\r\neat a hundred or two just to whet his appetite. Rousseau, Helvetius,\r\nDiderot, the Abbé Raynal, and Voltaire, are recorded lovers of oysters.\r\nDanton, Robespierre, and other of the revolutionists, frequented the\r\noyster _salons_ of Paris. Cambaceres was famous for his oyster feasts,\r\nand it is recorded of the great Napoleon that he always partook of the\r\nbivalve on the eve of his great battles, when they could be procured.\r\n\r\nIn short, it has been demonstrated as a gastronomic truth that there is\r\nno feast worthy of a connoisseur where oysters do not come to the front.\r\nIt is their office to open the way by that gentle excitement which\r\nprepares the stomach for its sublime function, digestion; in a word, the\r\noyster is the key of that paradise called appetite. \"There is no\r\nalimentary substance, not even excepting bread, which does not produce\r\nindigestion under given circumstances,\" says Reveille-Parise, \"but\r\noysters never.\" This is an homage which is due to them: \"We may eat them\r\nto-day, to-morrow, eat them always, and in profusion, without fear of\r\nindigestion.\" Dr. Gastaldi could swallow, we are assured, his forty\r\ndozen with impunity--quite a bank must he have eaten. He was\r\nunfortunately struck with apoplexy at table before a _paté de foie\r\ngras_.\r\n\r\nMontaigne quaintly says, to be subject to colic, or deny oneself\r\noysters, presents two evils to choose from, since one must choose\r\nbetween the two, and hazard something for his pleasure.\r\n\r\nEngland has always been famous for its oysters, and its pearls are said\r\nto have been the chief incentive to Cæsar's invasion. It is not,\r\ntherefore, to be supposed that British magnates could be indifferent to\r\nthe \"native.\" But the bivalve has perhaps been more celebrated, in prose\r\nand verse, north of the Tweed than south, where silent enjoyment is more\r\nrelished than noisy demonstration. Dugald Stewart, Hume, Cullen, and\r\nother Scotch philosophers of the last centuries, had their \"oyster\r\nploys\" as an accompaniment to their \"high jinks,\" in the quaint and\r\ndingy taverns of the old town of Edinburgh; and what the bivalve has\r\nbeen to modern celebrities let the _Noctes Ambrosianæ_ tell.\r\n\r\nThe oyster may thus be said to be the palm and glory of the table. It is\r\nconsidered the very perfection of digestive aliment. From Stockholm to\r\nNaples, from London to St. Petersburg, it is always in request. At St.\r\nPetersburg they cost a paper rouble (nearly one shilling), and at\r\nStockholm fivepence each. For the last year or two the English\r\namphitryon must pay from two shillings to half a crown a dozen for\r\nchoice natives.\r\n\r\nFor his daily nourishment a man of middle size requires a quantity of\r\nfood equal to twelve ounces of dry nitrogenized substance. According to\r\nthis calculation, it would be necessary to swallow sixteen dozen of\r\noysters to make up the necessary quantity. The small proportion of\r\nnutritive matter explains the extreme digestibility of the oyster. It\r\nalso explains the immense consumption of them attributed to the Emperor\r\nVitellius. The oyster is nothing more than water slightly gelatinized.\r\nWithout this Vitellius, all emperor and master of the world as he was,\r\nnever could have absorbed twelve hundred oysters by way of whetting his\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nThe gourmets were long of opinion that the quadrangular pad or cushion\r\nin the bivalve was the most savoury and exciting part. Certain\r\ndistinguished amateur performers adopted and proclaimed the principle of\r\ndividing transversely the body of the mollusc, and eating the cushion\r\nonly. Natural history explains this gastronomical discovery. It\r\nrecognizes the fact that the bile secreted by the liver is contained in\r\nthis substance, that it accelerates while it exhausts the qualitative\r\nsurface of the tongue and palate, aiding also the functions of the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have described the organization of the oyster, and we have said\r\nsomething of the enjoyment it confers. Did it ever occur to the various\r\nSocieties for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to consider whether\r\nthe oyster might not be a very proper object of their care? Let us see\r\nif we can bridge over the gulf.\r\n\r\nWe commence operations upon them by dragging them violently from their\r\nown element. We place them out afterwards in water-parks, more or less\r\nbriny and unsuitable, filled with villainous green matter, which\r\npresently pervades their breathing apparatus, impregnating, obstructing,\r\nand colouring it; the oyster swells, fattens, and soon attains that\r\nstate of obesity which verges on sickness.\r\n\r\nWhen the poor creature has attained its livid green colour, it is fished\r\nup a second time. Alas! it is now doomed neither to return to the sea,\r\nto the park, nor to its native rock. It has water at its disposal only\r\nin the very small quantity which it can retain between its two valves, a\r\nquantity scarcely sufficient to keep away asphyxia. It is shut up in an\r\nobscure narrow basket--an ignoble prison-house, without door or window.\r\nIt seems to be forgotten that they are animals: they are piled upon the\r\npavement like inert merchandise. The basket is carried by railway; the\r\nanimal, shaken out of existence almost, is at last landed at the door of\r\nsome oyster-shop; and this is the critical moment for the poor bivalve!\r\nIt is thrown into a tub with clean water enough to remind it of its\r\nformer luxurious life, when it is again seized by the pitiless master of\r\nits fate. With a great knife he brutally opens the shell, cuts through\r\nthe muscle by which it adheres to the valve, and violently detaches it,\r\nafter breaking the hinges. It is now laid out on a plate, exposed to\r\nevery current of air, and in this state of suffering it is carried to\r\nthe table. There the pitiless gourmet powders it over with the most\r\npungent pepper, squeezes over the wounded and still bleeding body the\r\nabomination of its race in the shape of citric acid or vinegar, and\r\nthen, alas! with a silver knife which cannot cut, he wounds and bruises\r\nit a second time; or, worse still, he saws and tears and rends it from\r\nits remaining shell; he seizes it with a three-pronged fork, which is\r\ndriven through liver and stomach, and throws it into his mouth, where\r\nthe teeth cut, crush, and grind it, and, while still living and\r\npalpitating, reduced to an inanimate mass, these organs first triturate\r\nit, while our gourmet is drinking its blood, its fat, and its bile.\r\n\r\nWe have said that oysters have no head, no arms--that they are without\r\neyes (although that is disputed), without ears, and without nose; that\r\nthey do not stir--that they never cry!\r\n\r\nAgreed, perfectly agreed; but all these negatives do not prevent its\r\nbeing sensible to pain. Two eminent Germans, Herren Brandt and\r\nRatzeburg, have proved that they possess a well-developed nervous\r\nsystem, and if they possess sensation they must suffer. \"Can an animal\r\nwith nerves be impassible?\" asks Voltaire. \"Can we suppose any such\r\nimpossible contradiction in Nature?\"\r\n\r\nThere is consolation, however, for all concerned. Let the humanitarian\r\nfishermen, oyster-dredgers, merchants, and consumers, console themselves\r\nwith the vast difference between the helpless imperfect mollusc and the\r\nhigher classes of animals. In the case of the former we swallow the\r\nanimal, scarcely thinking of its animal nature. It is the denizen of\r\nanother element, lives in a medium in which we cannot exist, presents\r\nitself in a form, so to speak, degraded--an obscure vitality, motions\r\nundecided, and habits scarcely discernible. We may therefore see the\r\noyster mutilated, mutilate them oneself, grind them, and swallow them,\r\nwithout emotion or remorse.\r\n\r\nA learned naturalist dwelling on the sea-shore possessed himself one day\r\nof a dozen oysters. He wished to study their organization; he turned\r\nthem, and turned them again, examined their several parts inside and\r\nout. He made drawings of and described them, and, having satisfied\r\nhimself that he had exhausted Science in observing, he swallowed them;\r\nthe interesting bivalves had lost nothing of their excellence, and the\r\nexamination did not prejudice the consummation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOyster fishing is pursued in a very different manner in different\r\ncountries. Round Minorca, divers, with hammers attached to the right\r\nhand, descend to the depth of a dozen fathoms, and bring up in their\r\nleft hand as many of the bivalves as they can carry, two fishermen,\r\nusually associating for the purpose, diving alternately until the boat\r\nis filled. On the English and French coasts the dredge is employed, as\r\nrepresented in PL. XII. This operation is necessary to keep down\r\nvegetation, which would stifle the oysters; the engine is of iron, and\r\nis very heavy. It is thrown overboard, and descends to the bottom of the\r\nsea, which it ploughs and scrapes up, detaching the oysters, and\r\nthrowing them into a net attached to the dredge. In this process\r\noysters, large and small, are torn from their native bed, some going\r\ninto the net, but a larger number, old and young, are torn from their\r\nnative bed, and buried in the mud. It would be difficult to imagine a\r\nmore destructive process; and when the habits of the oyster are\r\nconsidered, it is evidently one admirably contrived to destroy the race.\r\n\r\nIn France oyster dredging is conducted by fleets of thirty or forty\r\nboats, each carrying four or five men. At a fixed hour, and under the\r\nsurveillance of a coastguard in a pinnace bearing the national flag, the\r\nflotilla commences the fishing. In the estuary of the Thames the\r\npractice is much the same, although no official surveillance is\r\nobserved. Each bark is provided with four or five dredges, resembling in\r\nshape a common clasp purse. It is formed of network, with a strong iron\r\nframe, as represented in Fig. 172, the iron frame serving the double\r\npurpose of acting as a sucker, and keeping the mouth open, while giving\r\nit a proper pressure as it travels over the oyster-beds. When the boat\r\nis over the oyster scarp, the dredge is let down, and no more attractive\r\nsight exists than that presented by the well-appointed Whitstable boats\r\non one side of the estuary, or the Colne boats on the other, as they\r\nwear and tack over the oyster-beds, bearing up from time to time to haul\r\nin the dredge, and empty its contents into the hold. The tension of the\r\nrope is the signal for hauling in, and very heterogeneous are the\r\ncontents--sea-weeds, star-fishes, lobsters, crabs, actinia, and stones.\r\nIn this manner the common oyster fields on both sides of the Channel\r\nwere ploughed up by the oyster dredger pretty much as the ploughman on\r\nshore turns up a field. The consequence was that, twenty years ago, the\r\nFrench beds were totally exhausted, and France had to look to foreign\r\ncountries for its oyster. Oyster farms which had employed fourteen\r\nhundred men and two hundred boats were reduced to two hundred men and\r\ntwenty boats. Similar results from over-dredging would have followed, no\r\ndoubt, on this side the Channel had the mollusc not been protected by\r\nthe company and private proprietors who held the oyster-beds in the\r\nlarge estuaries. This state of things in France led to some important\r\ndiscoveries in the science of oyster culture, which have produced\r\nimportant changes there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XII.--Dredging for Oysters.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172. Dredge employed in Oyster fisheries.]\r\n\r\nThe name of Sergius Orata has already been mentioned as a cultivator of\r\noysters. He lived in the fifth century before our era, and according to\r\nPliny he first attempted parking oysters at Baia in the times of the\r\norator Lucius Crassus. He was the first to recognise the superior\r\nflavour of the oysters of the Lucrin Lake, the Avernus of the poets,\r\nprobably for trade reasons of his own, for then, as now, Reveille-Parise\r\nremarks, writing on the subject, \"tradesmen speculated on the weaknesses\r\nof human gourmandism.\" But Sergius really created a new industry, which\r\nis still practised in thousands of places much as he left it. As a proof\r\nof the perfection to which Sergius had brought oyster culture, his\r\ncontemporaries said of him, in allusion to the hanging banks which he\r\ninvented, that if he had been prevented from raising oysters in the\r\nLucrin Lake, \"he would have made them grow on the house-tops.\" The\r\ntraveller who visits this celebrated lake finds only a miry puddle. The\r\nprecious oysters placed there by Catiline's grandfather are replaced by\r\na host of miserable eels, which leap in the mud; vile mountains of\r\nashes, coal, and pumice-stone, which was thrown up in a night like the\r\nmushroom, having reduced the once celebrated lake into the state\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nRondeletius also speaks of a fisherman who understood the art of oyster\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan Lake Fusaro--the terrible Acheron of the poets--is a\r\ngreat oyster-park, in which Art is made effectually to aid Nature in the\r\nmultiplication of its products. This famous oyster-bank, which is\r\nrepresented in PL. XIII., lies in the neighbourhood of Baia and Cumæ. It\r\nforms one of the most interesting spots in that beautiful bay. In the\r\nmonth of February, 1865, M. Figuier tells us he traversed its celebrated\r\ncoast, seated himself on the banks of the historical lake, and tasted\r\nthe produce of this curious manufacture of living beings, whose origin\r\ndates from the Roman period.\r\n\r\nLake Fusaro was in ancient times a place of evil report: Virgil\r\nimmortalized it as the mythological Acheron; but its landscape had\r\nnothing of the sadness and desolation which accords with the sojourn of\r\nthe dead. It is a salt pond, shaded with a girdle of magnificent trees.\r\nIt is about a league in circumference, and about a fathom in depth at\r\nits deepest part; its bottom is muddy and black, like the rest of this\r\nvolcanic region.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood, from what has been said, that the chief obstacle\r\nto the reproduction of oysters is the absence of any solid body to which\r\nthe young spawn can attach itself, and the means of shelter from animals\r\nwhich prey upon them. The fishermen living on the shores of Lake Fusaro\r\nhave long realized this, and provided against it by warehousing, as it\r\nwere, in the lake near the sea, the oysters ready to discharge their\r\nspawn, while retaining the young generations captive in the protected\r\nbasins, where they are sheltered from various causes of destruction to\r\nwhich oysters are exposed in the open sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XIII.--General View of the Oyster Parks on Lake\r\nFusaro.]\r\n\r\nUpon the bottom of the lake, and on its circumference, the\r\nproprietors of Fusaro have constructed hillocks here and there, with\r\nstones heaped up, artificial rocks, raised sufficiently to shelter the\r\ndepôts from mud and slime. Upon these rocks they deposit the young\r\noysters gathered in the Gulf of Tarentum. Each of these rock-works is\r\nsurrounded by a girdle of piles, driven close to each other, and raised\r\na little above the surface of the water, as represented in Fig. 173.\r\nOther piles are distributed in long lines, and bound to each other by a\r\ncord, from which are suspended fagots of young wood. In the spawning\r\nseason the oysters which have been deposited on the artificial rocks\r\ndischarge the myriads of young fry which have been nurtured in the folds\r\nof their mantles. The fagots suspended from the piles arrest the germ\r\nbefore it is driven away by the waves, much as a swan attaches itself to\r\nthe first shrub which comes in the way. By these precautions the\r\nriverains of Fusaro have provided for the preservation of the young fry,\r\nbesides removing many of the natural enemies of the young oyster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173. Artificial Oyster-bank in Lake Fusaro.]\r\n\r\nIn other places the piles are distributed in long lines and bound\r\ntogether by strong cords, from which fagots of brushwood are suspended,\r\non which the young spawn lay hold, as in Fig. 174.\r\n\r\nBy means of these arrangements the pregnant oyster deposits its spawny\r\nprogeny in quiet repose; the young germs are intercepted by the fagots\r\nand hurdles suspended between the piles, where the young oysters\r\ndevelop themselves under the favourable conditions of repose,\r\ntemperature, and light. When the fishing season arrives, the piles and\r\nfagots which surround the beds are removed, and the oysters are gathered\r\nsuitable for market. The oysters thus selected for sale are packed\r\nloosely in osier baskets and sunk, while waiting for purchasers, into a\r\nreserve or park. This park is established on the shores of the lake. It\r\nis constructed of piles which support a gangway provided with hooks,\r\nfrom which the baskets filled with living oysters are suspended, ready\r\nfor sale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174. Pillars with cords attached in Lake Fusaro.]\r\n\r\nSome twenty years ago the oyster-beds of France had become totally\r\nexhausted under the open system of dredging; and circumstances having\r\nbrought the protective system pursued at Fusaro under the notice of M.\r\nCoste, a learned academician, to whom France is indebted for the\r\nrestoration of the bivalve, M. Coste reported to the Emperor in 1858\r\nthat at Rochelle, Marennes, Rochefort, at the Isles of Ré and Oleron,\r\nwhere there had formerly been twenty-three oyster-beds, there were now\r\nonly five, and these in danger of being destroyed by the increase of\r\nmussels; that at the Bay of St. Brieuc, so naturally suited for oyster\r\nculture, the beds were reduced to three; that even on the classic oyster\r\ngrounds of Cancale and Granville, it was only by the most careful\r\nadministration that decay was prevented, while the increasing numbers of\r\nconsumers threatened altogether to destroy an industry essentially\r\nnecessary for the support of a maritime population.\r\n\r\nThe impulse given by this report has been productive of the most\r\nsatisfactory results in France. All along the coast the maritime\r\npopulations are actively engaged in oyster culture. Oyster parks, in\r\nimitation of those at Fusaro, have sprung up. In his appeal to the\r\nEmperor, M. Coste suggested that the State, through the Administration\r\nof Marine, and by means of the vessels at its command, should take steps\r\nfor sowing the whole French coast in such a manner as to re-establish\r\nthe oyster-banks now in ruins, extend those which were prosperous, and\r\ncreate others anew wherever the nature of the bottom would permit. The\r\nfirst serious attempt to carry out the views of the distinguished\r\nacademician was made in the Bay of St. Brieuc. In the month of April in\r\nthe same year in which his report was received, operations commenced by\r\nplanting three millions of mother-oysters which had been dredged in the\r\ncommon ground; brood from the oyster grounds of Cancale and Tréquiers\r\nwere distributed in ten longitudinal lines on tiles, fragments of\r\npottery, and valves of shells. At the end of eight months the progress\r\nof the beds was tested, and the dredge in a few minutes brought up two\r\nthousand oysters fit for the table, while two fascines drawn up at\r\nrandom contained nearly twenty thousand, from one to two inches in\r\ndiameter. Two of these fascines exposed to public view at Béni and\r\nPatrieux excited the astonishment of the maritime population.\r\n\r\nThis result encouraged M. Coste to pursue his experiments upon a greater\r\nscale, and he now proposed to bring the whole littoral under a regulated\r\nsystem of oyster culture. In the roads of Toulon and in Lake Thau, which\r\ntouches this port, the same system was put in force by the\r\nAdministration of Marine as had already been done in the Bay of Arcachon\r\nand in the Isle of Ré. In these localities oyster culture assumed\r\ngigantic proportions. Associations were formed for the purpose of\r\nprosecuting them and forming oyster-parks.\r\n\r\nThese exertions roused the curiosity of foreign nations. Van Beneden, a\r\ndistinguished naturalist of Louvain, and M. Eschrecht of Copenhagen,\r\nvisited France to study the arrangements for oyster culture. M. Coste\r\ndemonstrated that parks could be established on all places visited by\r\nthe tide, and under his advice the Bay of Arcachon is now transformed\r\ninto a vast field of production, which increases every day, giving the\r\nhappiest presages of an abundant harvest. Already twelve hundred\r\ncapitalists, associated with a similar number of fishermen, occupy a\r\nsurface of nine hundred and eighty-eight acres, which emerge at low\r\nwater. In this bay the State has organized two model farms for\r\nexperimental purposes, in which tiles, fascines, and valves of shells\r\nare laid down with other appliances, to which the young oysters may\r\nattach themselves. These expedients have been so successful that the\r\npark, which has cost about £114, is now estimated to be worth about\r\n£8000 in money, with a total of five million oysters, large and small.\r\nThe Isle of Ré, which was originally surrounded by a muddy bottom ill\r\nadapted for oyster culture, has been totally changed, so that in two\r\nyears four leagues of foreshore have been turned into a rich and\r\nprofitable oyster-bed; twelve hundred parks are in full activity, and\r\ntwo thousand others are in course of construction, the whole forming a\r\ncomplete girdle round the island.\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of the green oysters of Marennes, the preservation,\r\namelioration, and ripening of these oysters, so to speak, representing a\r\nvery considerable branch of industry in France. In order to give the\r\nreader some idea of its importance, we shall give here a brief summary\r\nof M. Coste's voyage of exploration on the French littoral.\r\n\r\nThe parks at Marennes, in which the oysters are placed in order to\r\nacquire the green colour which characterises them, are basins stretching\r\nalong both banks of the Seudre for many leagues. They are locally known\r\nas _claires_, and differ from the oyster-parks of other countries in\r\nthis particular--that, while the ordinary parks are so arranged as to be\r\nsubmerged at every return of the tide, the basins of Marennes are so\r\narranged that they can only be submerged at spring tides; that is, at\r\nthe new and full moon, when the waters rise beyond the ordinary level.\r\n\r\nThe basins of _claires_ occupy from two hundred and fifty to three\r\nhundred square yards of superficies; two sluices permit of the entrance\r\nand withdrawal of water at will, so as to maintain it at the level most\r\nconvenient to the industrial wants of the place, or to empty it\r\naltogether when it is necessary to cleanse the basin, pave the bottom,\r\nand furnish it with a fresh supply of oysters.\r\n\r\nWhen these necessary works are completed, advantage is taken of the\r\nfirst spring tide to fill the basin. When the tide begins to ebb, the\r\nsluices are closed, so as to retain sufficient water in the basins; and\r\nwhile thus shut up, salt held in solution is deposited, and qualities\r\nanalogous to those of marine bottoms are produced, purged by cleansing\r\nprocesses of all products offensive to the bivalves.\r\n\r\nWhen the basin has been filled with sea-water for the necessary time,\r\nand the bottom is sufficiently impregnated, it is emptied and left to\r\ndry; and now, the soil being prepared, it only remains to furnish it\r\nwith oysters of a mellow and ripe age, in order to give them their green\r\nhue. Towards the month of September, at low water, the whole sea-side\r\npopulation of Marennes go to gather oysters on the pavement left\r\nuncovered by the ebbing tide, or by using a dredger in the deeper parts\r\nof the _claires_ where the water still remains. A temporary magazine for\r\nthe reception of the oysters thus gathered is erected on the banks,\r\nwhich the water revisits twice a day. The young are reserved for\r\ncultivation on the parks or _claires_; the fullest are sold for\r\nconsumption in the neighbourhood; but the quantity of oysters raised at\r\nMarennes is insufficient to supply the demand. About a third of the\r\nprovision intended for the _claires_ comes from the coasts of Brittany,\r\nof Normandy, and La Vendée. \"These foreign oysters,\" says M. Coste,\r\n\"never attain the fine flavour of those bred in the locality. It is\r\nnecessary to keep them for a long time in the _claires_ before they are\r\nsufficiently ameliorated, and, even when they become green, they retain\r\ntraces of their primitive nature, remaining hard, in spite of the new\r\nqualities imparted to them by cultivation; a certain bitterness remains,\r\nwhich is easily distinguished by the true amateur; it is the same with\r\nindigenous adult oysters. When they are taken at this stage of their\r\nexistence the colouring does not succeed with them;--it is only, so to\r\nspeak, the false brand used to give a speculative value to the\r\nmerchandise. It is not enough that the mollusc should have a fine\r\nflavour; it must have the peculiar taste. It is not enough that it has\r\nthe green hue; it is necessary that these qualities should pervade it\r\nfrom the earliest age, and that the culture of the _claires_ should\r\ncontinue to the end.\" It is thus necessary that the oysters for the\r\n_claires_ of Marennes should be selected when from twelve to eighteen\r\nmonths old, that the shells should be well-formed, and free from all\r\nforeign bodies adhering to the surface. Being thus carefully picked out,\r\nthe oysters are distributed over the bottom of the _claires_ with a\r\nshovel, and afterwards so arranged by the hand that they may not touch\r\neach other when they increase in size; that they do not embarrass each\r\nother by the movements of their valves; and that nothing should\r\ninterfere with the regularity of their forms. The young colony reposes\r\nunder a sheet of water from twelve to eighteen inches deep, which is, as\r\nwe have said, only renewed at spring tides, which reach the level. Nor\r\nare the oysters abandoned to themselves in these privileged beds while\r\nthey are growing and ripening. They are objects of continual care and of\r\nspecial manipulation. The spring tides visit the _claires_ charged with\r\nmud, which, if deposited in the motionless basins, would act as a mortal\r\npoison to the young mollusc; hence the necessity of transporting them\r\nfrom one _claire_ charged with mud into others free from such\r\naccumulations; and this is a process in constant operation until the\r\nanimals are finally gathered for consumption. Oysters deposited in the\r\n_claires_ aged eighteen months should remain two years before they are\r\nready for use; but three and even four years are required to give them\r\nthe full degree of perfection which characterises the best products of\r\nthe Marennes oyster-parks.\r\n\r\nOysters placed in the reservoirs in an adult state become green, it is\r\ntrue, in a very few days, but they never attain the exquisite flavour of\r\nthose which have been bred in the parks, and have undergone the costly\r\nmanipulation described from their earliest years.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, What is the colouring principle which is here in\r\noperation? The green colour is not general; it is shown principally on\r\nthe branchiæ, upon the labial feelers and intestinal canal; it is rather\r\nundecided; and the colouring matter appears to differ chemically from\r\nall other known pigments of green colour. Must it be attributed to the\r\nsoil of the _claire_? This is its most probable origin. But many\r\nnaturalists insist that the colouring matter proceeds from an infusorial\r\nanimalcule, the green-coloured Vibrion. Others have hazarded the opinion\r\nthat it is a disease of the liver in our unfortunate bivalve which\r\nproduces the colour. Bile secreted in excess by a diseased liver would\r\ngive a green hue to the parenchyma of the respiratory organs of an\r\nanimal rendered sick by the exceptional treatment to which it has been\r\nsubjected. Of these three opinions, says M. Figuier, the first, as we\r\nhave said, presents the greatest appearance of probability.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe system of oyster farms, which has worked admirably for the\r\ncompanies themselves, has proved of doubtful utility, so far as the\r\noyster-eating public is concerned, as the following sketch of the\r\nWhitstable oyster farms will show. The oyster farm at Whitstable is\r\nco-operative in the best sense of the term, and has been in operation\r\nfor many years. The Company possesses large oyster grounds, and a fine\r\nfleet of boats kept for the purpose of dredging and planting the beds;\r\nit is established under the Joint Stock Companies Act, but there is no\r\nother way of entrance into it but by birth, as none of the free\r\ndredgermen of the town can hold shares. \"When a man dies his interest in\r\nthe Company dies with him, but his widow, if he leaves one, obtains a\r\npension. The affairs of the Company are managed by twelve directors, who\r\nare called \"the jury.\"\r\n\r\n\"The layings at Whitstable,\" to summarise Mr. Bertram, \"occupy about a\r\nmile and a half square; and the oyster-beds have been so prosperous as\r\nto have obtained the name of the 'happy fishing grounds.' Whitstable\r\nlies in a sandy bay, formed by a small branch of the Medway, which\r\nseparates the Isle of Sheppey from the mainland. Throughout this bay,\r\nfrom the town of Whitstable at its eastern extremity to the old town of\r\nFaversham, which lies several miles inland, the whole of the estuary is\r\noccupied by oyster farms, on which the maritime population, to the\r\nextent of three thousand people and upwards, is occupied; the sum paid\r\nfor labour by the various companies being set down at £160,000 per\r\nannum, besides the employment given at Whitstable in building and\r\nrepairing boats, dredges and other requisites for the oyster-fishing.\r\nThe business of the various companies is to feed oysters for the London\r\nand other markets, to protect the spawn or floatsome, as the dredgers\r\ncall it, which is emitted on their own beds, and to furnish, by purchase\r\nor otherwise, the new brood necessary to supply the beds which have been\r\ntaken up for consumption.\"\r\n\r\nWe have hinted above that in oyster, as in other fisheries, a wasteful\r\nspirit of extravagance has hitherto prevailed. It appears, however, that\r\nno rule can be laid down even as to the particular year in which the\r\noysters will spawn, much less where it will be carried to; for, although\r\nthe artificial contrivances adopted by Sergius Orata for saving the\r\nspawn are perfectly well known to the parties interested here, they have\r\nnot hitherto been imitated; the practice of the companies and private\r\nowners of oyster-layers being to purchase their young brood from the\r\ndredgers and others who fish along the public foreshore and open grounds\r\non the Kent and Essex coasts, and even as far north as the Frith of\r\nForth. The little bay of Pont, for instance, on the Essex coast, which\r\nis an open piece of water sixteen miles long and three broad, free to\r\nall, and which formerly yielded considerable supplies to Billingsgate,\r\nnow gives employment to a hundred and fifty boats, each with crews of\r\nthree or four men, who are wholly employed in obtaining young\r\nbrood--that is, oysters from eighteen months to two years old, which\r\nthey sell to the oyster farmers. The result is, that the oyster farms\r\nhave become a vast monopoly. By tacit consent they agree to feed the\r\nmarket at some eight pounds sterling per bushel; they pay the dredger\r\none-fourth of that sum; and as the common fishing grounds are thus\r\nrendered mere nurseries of young brood, the lover of the bivalve must\r\nreconcile himself to pay a monopoly price for the precious morsel.\r\n\r\nThe system pursued at Whitstable, and other oyster-parks in the estuary\r\nof the Thames and Medway, is most efficient. The oysters reared in them,\r\ncalled \"natives,\" in contradistinction to those called \"commons,\" which\r\nare bred in their natural beds, are justly considered to be very\r\nsuperior in flavour, although they are a mixed breed, being brought from\r\nevery quarter to augment the stock.\r\n\r\nThe Thames, or \"native\" system, is as follows: Every year each layer is\r\ngone over and examined by means of a dredge, successive portions being\r\ndone day by day, till it may be said that each individual oyster has\r\nbeen examined; the young brood is detached from its bed, the double\r\noysters are separated, and all kinds of enemies killed. During three\r\ndays in each week dredging is pursued for \"planting;\" that is, for\r\ntransference from one bed to another more suitable for their growth or\r\nfattening, and for the removal of the dead or sickly oysters and\r\nmussels. On the other three days dredging for market takes place, when\r\nthe more mature beds are dredged, and as many are lifted as are\r\nrequired. Not only is this constant dredging of the beds themselves\r\nnecessary, but the public beds immediately outside require the same care\r\nto keep them in a fit state, and free from enemies.\r\n\r\nThe same story of over-fishing and improvidence extends round our whole\r\ncoast. The far-famed Pandores obtained at Preston Pans, near Edinburgh,\r\nonce so cheap, are becoming scarce and dear. The brood is caught and\r\nbarreled for export to Holland and other places, especially the Thames\r\noyster farms. English buyers pick the grown oysters for Manchester and\r\nother large provincial markets, and the Corporation of Edinburgh, the\r\nDuke of Buccleuch, and other proprietors of the foreshore, have just\r\ninterfered in time to prevent the total destruction of the trade, when\r\nthe wild song of the Cockenzie dredgerman might have been left to charm\r\nsome future antiquary, as it is now said to charm the oyster into the\r\ndredge with its refrain:\r\n\r\n    \"The herring it loves the merry moonlight,\r\n      The mackerel it loves the wind;\r\n    But the oyster it loves the dredger's song,\r\n      For it comes of a gentle kind.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scallop-shell (_Pecten_) is round, nearly equal-sided, resting on\r\nthe right valve, which is more convex and marked with radiating ribs.\r\nLinnæus made the mistake of confounding with the _Ostrea_ a great number\r\nof shells, which, by their channeled edges and surfaces, strongly\r\nreminded one of the arrangements of the teeth of a comb, whence their\r\nname of _Pecten_. They were well known to naturalists long before the\r\ntime of Linnæus, under the name of _Pilgrims'_ shells, a name which came\r\ninto use from the practice which prevailed among pilgrims in the middle\r\nages--we know not why--of ornamenting habits and hats with the valves of\r\nsome of the species.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the _Pecten_ is in general nearly circular, more or less\r\nelongated, and terminated towards the summit in a straight line, forming\r\na sort of triangular appendage called the ear, to which the hinges are\r\nattached. The valves are very regular, but with no resemblance to each\r\nother. In some species, the shell of which is closely shut, the lower\r\nvalve is more or less convex than the upper one. In others, both valves\r\nare convex. The hinge is without teeth, and the ligament, which is\r\nintended to close the shell, is inserted into a triangular depression or\r\ndimple. The retractile muscle is unequal, and nearly central. The valves\r\nare not nacred inside, and are formed on their exterior surface of\r\nnumerous fluted channels, which spring from a lobe more or less pointed\r\nat the summit, diverging towards the circumference. The edges are\r\nsometimes smooth, as in the Watered Pecten (_P. pseudamussium_, Fig.\r\n175), but more frequently they are formed in strips or scales, as in the\r\nSmooth-shelled Pecten (_P. glaber_, Fig. 176). Upon the whole, however,\r\nthe Pectens are very variable, but always elegant in form; the colours\r\nare frequently lively and brilliant. In PL. XIV., some of the most\r\nstriking forms are represented, as in Fig. I., the Ducal Mantle (_Pecten\r\npallium_), an inhabitant of the Indian Ocean, remarkable for its elegant\r\nform, its twelve radiating stripes, diverging towards the circumference,\r\nthe horizontal furrows of its salient scales, and the striking\r\ndistribution of its white spots upon a bed of red and brown marble; Fig.\r\nII., the Purple Pecten; Fig. III., the Coral Pecten; Fig. IV., the Tiger\r\nPecten; Fig. V., the Foliaceous Pecten; and Fig. VI., the Northern\r\nPecten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175. Pecten pseudamussium (Chenu).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176. Pecten glaber (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe animal which inhabits the Pecten shell has the general form of the\r\noyster, differing however from it in a remarkable manner. The edges of\r\nthe mantle are furnished with multiplied fringes of simple tentacles,\r\nbetween which we find other tentacular appendages a little thicker, each\r\nterminating in a sort of small pearl, vividly coloured, to which is\r\nattached a nervous thread, which has been taken for an eye. Another\r\ndifference: the branchiæ, in place of being connected by a striated\r\nlamina, as is the case in the oyster, are cut into parallel capillary\r\nfilaments, forming a free and floating fringe, and the mouth is\r\nsurrounded by salient many-cleft lips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.--Pectinidæ.\r\n\r\n    I. Pecten pallium. (Linn.)\r\n    II. Pecten purpuratus. (Lamarck.)\r\n    III. Pecten foliaceus.\r\n    IV. Pecten tigris. (Lamarck.)\r\n    V. Pecten nodasus. (Linn.)\r\n    VI. Pecten islandicus. (Chemnitz.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile the oyster shell is completely fixed to its bed, the Pecten is, on\r\nthe contrary, perfectly free, and shifts from place to place, moving in\r\nthe water even with a certain amount of agility; by smartly closing its\r\nhalf-opened valves and forcibly expelling the water, it moves backward\r\nby a sort of reaction; this action, repeated many times, compels the\r\nanimal to move almost in spite of itself, and enables it to avoid\r\ndanger, or directs its steps towards the spot it wishes to reach.\r\nSome naturalists even assert that, when raised to the surface, the\r\nPecten half opens its shell in such a manner that the upper valve serves\r\nthe purpose of a sail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177. Pecten opercularis (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe Pectens, of which a hundred and seventy-six species are described,\r\nare inhabitants of every known sea. Twenty species belong to Europe,\r\namong which we may mention _P. opercularis_, represented in Fig. 177;\r\n_P. glaber_, and _P. nivea_. Fig. 178 represents the White-mantled\r\nPecten (_P. plica_, Linn.) of the Indian Ocean, and Fig. 179, the\r\nConcentric Pecten (_P. Japonica_) of the Japan seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178. Pecten plica (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179. Pecten Japonica (Gmellin).]\r\n\r\nAmong the Ostreadæ the shells of _Spondylus_ are distinguished for their\r\nvariety of form and the brilliant colours with which they are decorated.\r\nThis makes them much sought after by amateur collectors, and procures\r\nfor them a high price. The shell of _Spondylus_ is solid and thick, with\r\nunequal adherent valves, nearly always bristling with spines, forming a\r\nvery peculiar kind of ornamentation to the valves; the hinges have two\r\nvery strong teeth. The animals which inhabit this shell resemble the\r\noyster in many respects, but they still more closely resemble the\r\nPectens. The edges of the mantle are provided with two rows of\r\ntentacles, the exterior row being, many of them, furnished at their\r\nextremities with coloured tubercles. As examples, we note several\r\nspecies of these bivalves for representation. _Spondylus regius_ (PL.\r\nXV. Fig. I.) is, perhaps, the most remarkable for its immense spines.\r\n_Spondylus radians_, Lamarck (Fig. III.), is noted for its elegant form.\r\n_Spondylus avicularis_ (Fig. IV.) shows remarkable inequality in the\r\nvalves. _Spondylus imperialis_, Chenu (Fig. II.), has long projecting\r\nspines, like feet, and the Scaly Spondylus (_S. crassisquama_, Fig. V.)\r\nis covered with scales arranged like so many roofing-tiles.\r\n\r\nLike oysters, the genus Spondylus is frequently found firmly rooted to\r\nrocks and other submarine bodies, and, oftener still, heaped one upon\r\nthe other, like herrings in their barrel.\r\n\r\nThese animals belong essentially to the seas of warm countries. We find\r\nthem, however, occupying considerable space in the Mediterranean, where\r\n(Fig. VI.) the Ass-footed Spondylus (_S. gæderopus_) abounds.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable species of all is assuredly _Spondylus regius_\r\n(PL. XV. Fig. I.). This species is a native of the Indian Ocean, and\r\nthere scarcely exist three fragments of this rare shell in the museums\r\nof Europe. M. Chenu relates in one of his books an anecdote which would\r\nprove--if any proof were necessary--how far the desire of a collector to\r\nobtain possession of some rare and costly specimen will carry him in\r\norder to attain his object. \"M. R----,\" says M. Chenu, \"was Professor of\r\nBotany to the Faculty of Paris, and was, as some times happens, more\r\nlearned than rich; he wished, on the invitation of a stranger, to\r\npurchase one of these shells at a very high price, which might be from\r\n3000 to 6000 francs; the bargain was made, and the price agreed upon; it\r\nwas only necessary to pay. The money in the professor's hands made only\r\na small part of the sum the merchant was to receive for his shell, and\r\nhe would not part with it without payment. M. R----, now consulting his\r\ndesire to possess the shell more than his weak resources, made up\r\nsecretly a parcel of his scanty plate, and went out to sell it. Without\r\nconsulting his wife he replaced his silver plate by coverings of tin,\r\nand ran to the merchant to secure his coveted Spondylus, which he\r\nbelieved to be _S. regius_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.--Spondylus.\r\n\r\n    I. Spondylus regius. (Linn.)\r\n    II. Spondylus imperialis. (Chemu.)\r\n    III. Spondylus radians. (Lamarck.)\r\n    IV. Spondylus avicularis. (Lamarck.)\r\n    V. Spondylus crassisquama. (Lamarck.)\r\n    VI. Spondylus gæderopus. (Linn.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\"The hour of dinner arrived, and we may imagine the astonishment of\r\nMadame R----, who could not comprehend the strange metamorphosis of her\r\nplate. She delivered herself of a thousand painful conjectures on the\r\nsubject. M. R----, on his part, returned home happy with his shell,\r\nwhich he had committed to the safe custody of a box placed in his coat\r\npocket. But, as he approached the house, he paused, and began for the\r\nfirst time to think of the reception he might meet with. The reproaches\r\nwhich awaited him, however, were compensated when he thought of the\r\ntreasure he carried home. Finally, he reached home, and Madame R----'s\r\nwrath was worthy of the occasion; the poor man was overwhelmed with the\r\ngrief he had caused his wife; his courage altogether forsook him. He\r\nforgot his shell, and, in his trepidation, seated himself on a chair\r\nwithout the necessary adjustment of his garment. He was only reminded of\r\nhis treasure by hearing the crushing sound of the broken box which\r\ncontained it. Fortunately, the evil was not very great--two spines only\r\nof the shell were broken; but the good man's grief made so great an\r\nimpression on Madame R----, that she no longer thought of her own loss,\r\nbut directed all her efforts to console the simple-minded philosopher.\"\r\n\r\nThe variation in the number and direction of the spines is a striking\r\nfeature in Spondylus. When the whole lower surface adheres to branches\r\nof coral, a very frequent occurrence, they are confined to the upper\r\nvalve, but when a part only of the valve, the whole surface becomes\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\nHaving finished our short sketch of the Conchifera, we shall now treat\r\nof the singular group, Brachiopoda,[11] which some place nearer to the\r\nGasteropoda than the Pteropoda, giving them, in fact, their place. It is\r\nout of the province of this work to enter into the physiological\r\narguments of such a question. The days of the Brachiopoda or\r\nshort-footed animals are past. Of the 1842[12] species formerly known, a\r\nfew types of a small number of genera only are left, numbering in all\r\n102. The Terebratulidæ are best represented; there were once 300 or 400\r\nspecies; there are now not more than 67 in the seas of the world. The\r\ndifference between the past and the present is especially striking, when\r\nwe compare the recent and fossil species of Europe. Among no other class\r\nof shells has there been such a wholesale extinction of species. The\r\ngreat family of Spiriferæ are wholly extinct, and of 400 Rhynconella\r\nonly four are now living. The curious Crania, Discina, and Lingula are\r\nstill living, and are mostly found in the seas of the southern\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: We give this illustration as representing the comparative\r\nsize of the oysters at different ages; but it is necessary to state that\r\nthe specimens were artificially attached to the block by means of glue\r\nfor exhibition.

Firstly, Nucleobranchiata, animals which float on the surface of\r\nthe ocean: they are Diæcious, or in separate sexes, and the nervous\r\nsystem is widely distributed in the body, the shell, in Carinaria, for\r\ninstance, covering only a very small portion of the body. The first\r\nfamily of this order is Atlantidæ, of which the types are the fossil\r\nBellerophon and the recent Atlanta.\r\n\r\nThe second family is Firolidæ, the types of which are Carinaria and\r\nFirola. Carinaria or glass nautilus is shaped like the bonnet-cap shell,\r\nPileopsis. It is as transparent as glass; and although now very common,\r\nwas formerly one of the most highly-prized shells by collectors. The\r\nsecond order of Gasteropoda is Opistho-Branchiata, and is divided into\r\ntwo sections, the Nudibranchiata, and the Tectibranchiata. The\r\nNudibranchiata have no shell except in the larva state; they mostly live\r\nat the bottom of the sea on rocky shores, but a small number swim on the\r\nsurface. They are remarkable for their variety of form and vivid\r\ncolouring, being the most beautiful of all molluscous animals; they may\r\ntruly be called the caterpillars of the sea, for their branchiæ remind\r\nus of the spines with which many lepidopterous larvæ are covered.\r\n\r\nThe first family is Elysiadæ, types Limapontia and Elysia.\r\n\r\nThe second is Phyllirhoidæ, type Phyllirhoe.\r\n\r\nThe third is Æolidæ, types Glaucus and Æolis.\r\n\r\nThe fourth is Tritoniadæ, types Scyllæa and Tritonia.\r\n\r\nThe fifth is Doridæ, types Idalia and Doris, the curious sea-lemon.\r\n\r\nThe first family of the second division, Tectibranchiata, is\r\nPhyllidiadæ, types Diphyllidia and Phyllidia.\r\n\r\nThe second family is Pleurobranchidæ, types, Umbrella, in form\r\nresembling a limpet, and Pleurobranchus.\r\n\r\nThe third family is Aplysiadæ, types, Dolabella and Aplysia.\r\n\r\nThe fourth family is Bullidæ, types, Scaphander, Acera, and Bulla.\r\n\r\nThe fifth family is Tornatellidæ, types, Tornatina and Tornatella.\r\n\r\nThe third order is the Pulmonifera, and the fourth is the\r\nProsobranchiata; we shall speak of them in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIn this family we reach a group of Gasteropods much more numerous, both\r\nin species and in special types, which respire by the aid of branchiæ,\r\nor gills. Cuvier divides them into many orders, based chiefly upon their\r\nrespiratory organs.\r\n\r\nThe Tectibranchiata have the gills attached either to the right side of\r\nthe body or upon the back, arranged in the form of leaflets, more or\r\nless divided, but not symmetrical, and nearly covered by the mantle.\r\n_Bulla_ and _Aplysia_ are the two principal genera of the group, and may\r\nbe considered as the type of two small families.\r\n\r\nThe _Aplysiæ_ were known to the ancients under the name of sea-hares\r\n(_Lepus marinus_), from some fancied resemblance to the terrestrial\r\nhare. They were objects of profound horror, inspired either by their\r\nsingular form, or from an acrid, caustic, and inodorous liquid which\r\nthey secrete. A magic influence was attributed to them; they were\r\nsupposed, for instance, to have influence over the female heart. It is\r\nnot easy, however, to explain the evil renown acquired by an animal\r\nwhich is known to be gentle and even timid. They are naked and fat,\r\nsomewhat resembling the Limnæa in their oval, elongated form, their\r\nthickness in the dorsal region, and their posterior locomotion. Their\r\nhead, which is very indistinct, is furnished with four tentacles, the\r\nanterior two of which are the largest, and somewhat resemble the ears of\r\na hare. The eyes are found at the base of the posterior tentacles. These\r\ncharacters are observed in _Aplysia depilans_ (Fig. 180). _Aplysia inca_\r\nshows also the same arrangement (Fig. 181). In this family the mollusc\r\nis much more important from its volume than from its internal,\r\nrudimentary, and horny shell, which is contained in the branchial\r\nshield. In Fig. 182 we have the small and thin cartilaginous shell which\r\nexists in the interior of the animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180. Aplysia depilans (Lin).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181. Aplysia inca (D'Orbigny).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182. Shell of Aplysia inca.]\r\n\r\nThe Aplysiæ are found nearly in every region of the globe, not only upon\r\nthe shores of the Continent, but on every island shore. They commonly\r\ninhabit sandy and muddy shores of small depths, or even the rocky\r\nrecesses, or under shelter of the stones which have fallen from the\r\ncliffs. Their eggs consist of those long filaments which are discharged\r\nin immense numbers, and which fishermen call sea-worms.\r\n\r\nThey feed upon certain algæ, with which the bottom of the sea is\r\ncovered; but they eat, also, small marine animals, such as the naked\r\nmolluscs, annelids, and crustaceans.\r\n\r\nWe are the less astonished to see the Aplysiæ so gluttonous when we\r\nlearn how liberally Nature has accorded to them organs of mastication,\r\ntrituration, and digestion. Their mouth is formed of thick and muscular\r\nlips; a very long oesophagus or gullet succeeds, and this oesophagus\r\ndoes not communicate with a single stomach, but with four--one enormous\r\nmembranous crop, an exceedingly muscular gizzard, with two accessary\r\npockets, one of which terminates in the form of a sac. The gizzard has\r\nthick walls, and is furnished on the internal wall with cartilaginous\r\nquadrangular pyramids, the summits of which intertwine. This apparatus\r\nis intended to bruise the food when it reaches the third stomach. It is\r\nalso armed with little hooks, the curvature of which is directed towards\r\nthe entrance of the gizzard.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Bulla_ differs materially from the Aplysiæ. They have a\r\nwell-developed shell, the form of which is elegant; they are delicate in\r\nstructure; their brilliant colours, consisting of red, black, or white\r\nbands, separated by many varied tints, cause these little molluscs to be\r\nmuch sought after for ornamental collections. The shell itself is oval\r\nor globulous, rolled up in a scroll, smooth, spotted, very thin and\r\nfragile, with a concave spiral, umbilicate, open in all its length, with\r\na straight, wide, and cutting edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 183 and 184. Bulla ampulla (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nObtuse at its two extremities, neither the head of the animal nor the\r\ntentacles are very apparent. The gills are placed under the back, a\r\nlittle to the right and behind; its stomach, which alone fills a great\r\npart of the cavity of the body, presents the peculiarity, already noted\r\nin the Aplysia, of being furnished with bony pieces, evidently intended\r\nto grind the food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185. Bulla oblonga (Adams).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186. Bulla aspersa (Adams).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187. Bulla nebulosa (Gould).]\r\n\r\nThe Bullæ can swim with facility in deep water, but they evidently\r\nprefer the shallows and a sandy bottom, feeding upon smaller molluscs.\r\nThey are found in every sea, but they abound chiefly in the Indian Ocean\r\nand Oceania. Some species, however, such as _Bulla ampulla_ (Figs. 183\r\nand 184), the shell of which is shaded grey and brown, and the\r\nWater-drop (_Bulla hydratis_), inhabit European seas. _Bulla oblonga_\r\nand _Bulla aspersa_ (Adams), and _Bulla nebulosa_ (Gould), represented\r\nin Figs. 185, 186, and 187, are also well-known species.\r\n\r\nWe take leave of our little friends the Headless Mollusca or _Acephalæ_,\r\nand direct our attention to those molluscs to which Nature has been more\r\ngenerous, and furnished with a head. This head, however, is still\r\ncarried humbly; it is not yet _os sublime dedit_; it is drawn along an\r\ninch or so from the ground, and in no respect resembles the proud and\r\nmagnificent organ which crowns and adorns the body of the greater and\r\nmore perfectly organized animals.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Cephalous Mollusca present three principal\r\ntypes, which has led to their being divided into three classes, after\r\ntheir more salient characteristics of form and locomotive apparatus;\r\nnamely, _Gasteropoda_, _Pteropoda_, and _Cephalopoda_.\r\n\r\nIn the class _Gasteropoda_ (from γαστὴρ, _belly_, ποῦϛ,\r\ngen.ποδὸϛ, _foot_) the locomotive apparatus consists of a\r\nflattened muscular disk, placed under the belly of the animal, aided\r\nby which it creeps. The Snail (_Helix_), the Slug (_Limax_), and the\r\nCowrie, (_Cyprea_), are types of this class.\r\n\r\nIn the _Pteropoda_, from πτερὸν, _wing_, and ποῦϛ, _foot_, the\r\nlocomotive apparatus assumes the form of wings, or membranous\r\nswimming-fins, placed on each side of the neck. The _Hyalea_ and _Clio_\r\nare types of this class.\r\n\r\nIn the _Cephalopoda_, from κεφαλὴ,, _head_, and ποῦϛ, _foot_,\r\nthe locomotive apparatus consists of arms, or tentacles, which surround\r\nthe mouth in numbers more or less considerable. The Cuttle-fish\r\n(_Sepia_), and the Poulpes (_Octopoda_) are types of this last class.\r\n\r\nThe Molluscous Gasteropoda have the organs of respiration formed for\r\naerial respiration, or for respiration under water.\r\n\r\nThis physiological arrangement involves important differences in\r\ninternal organization in these molluscs, and renders it convenient to\r\ndivide them into two secondary groups; namely, _Pulmonary Gasteropods_,\r\nwhich breathe in the air, and by a species of lung, and _Non-pulmonary\r\nGasteropods_, which breathe in the water, by means of branchiæ or\r\ngills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nPULMONARY GASTEROPODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Pulmonary Gasteropods_ comprehend those molluscs which, as we have\r\nsaid, live in the air and breathe the natural atmosphere. The\r\nrespiratory organ is a cavity in the walls of which the blood-vessels\r\nform a complicated network. The air enters this cavity through an\r\norifice, which the animal opens and shuts at will--a species of lung, in\r\nshort, which is placed upon the back of the animal. They are both\r\nterrestrial and aquatic animals. In the latter case, they must come to\r\nthe surface of the water in order to breathe, like the phocas and\r\ncetacea among the Mammifera.\r\n\r\nThe Pulmonifera, the second order of Gasteropods, comprehends those\r\nanimals which live in and breathe the air.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into four sections; the Operculata, or animals whose\r\nshells are closed by an operculum, and the In-Operculata, or animals\r\nwithout operculum.\r\n\r\nOperculata is divided into two families; first, Aciculidæ, types,\r\nGeomelania and Acicula; and second, Cyclostomidæ, types, Pupina and\r\nCyclostoma. Cyclostoma is perhaps the best known; the mouth is circular,\r\nthe name being derived from _cyclos_, circle, and _stoma_, mouth.\r\n\r\nThe second section, In-Opercula, contains five families.\r\n\r\nFirst, Auriculidæ, types, Conovulus and Auricula.\r\n\r\nSecond, Limnæidæ, types, Planorbis, Physa, and Limnæa.\r\n\r\nThird, Oncidiadæ, types, Vaginulus and Oncidium.\r\n\r\nFourth, Limacidæ, types, Testacella and Limax.\r\n\r\nFifth, Helicidæ, types, Clausilia, Pupa, Achatina, Bulimus, Succinea,\r\nVitrina, and Helix.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMNÆIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe Limnæidæ, _Aquatic Pulmonary Gasteropods_, is the second family of\r\nthe series. They belong to the group that come to the surface of the\r\nwater to breathe, as do the cetacea and phocas among the Mammifera. The\r\n_Limnæa_, _Planorbis_, and _Physa_ are the principal members of this\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nLimnæa lives in great numbers in the stagnant waters of all countries,\r\nparticularly of temperate climates. It cannot remain long under water,\r\nbeing compelled frequently to rise to the surface in order to breathe\r\natmospheric air. It is even observed, by a mechanism not very well\r\nunderstood, to turn itself upside down, in such a manner as to present\r\nitself feet uppermost, and to move slowly along in this position,\r\ncreeping, as it were, through the water. It is difficult to comprehend\r\nhow the movable liquid bed upon which the animal operates can offer\r\nresistance enough to permit of its creeping as if it were on a solid\r\nresisting body; it seems to produce the movement with the assistance of\r\nits foot, which is broad and thick, and shorter than the shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188. Limnæa stagnalis (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nLimnæa has a large flat head, from each side of which issues a\r\ntriangular contractile tentacle, carrying at its base and on the inner\r\nside an extremely small dot, or eye. The most considerable part of the\r\nbody, comprehending the visceral mass, is spiral, and is contained in a\r\nthin diaphanous shell (Fig. 188), the turns in the spiral of which are\r\ngenerally elongated, the last turn being larger than all the others. The\r\ninterior of this is occupied by the respiratory cavity, which\r\ncommunicates outwardly by an opening analogous to that which exists in\r\nthe snails. This opening dilates and contracts in such a manner as to\r\nreceive the air in the cavity, and exclude water when the animal feeds\r\nitself under the water. The mouth is a transverse slit between two\r\nrather thin lips, and is armed with small canine teeth. When the animal\r\nsallies from its shell, it has the appearance of a short trumpet. In its\r\ninterior is a roundish, thick, and fleshy tubercle, not unlike the\r\ntongue of a paroquet. The true tongue, however, which lies at the bottom\r\nof the slit, is flat, oval-shaped, and supported by a cartilaginous or\r\nbony pedicle.\r\n\r\nLimnæa, aided by this very complicated buccal apparatus, is enabled to\r\nfeed itself with vegetable substances, such as the leaves of aquatic\r\nplants, which it cuts and bruises with its teeth. They are very active\r\nin the season, reproducing towards the end of spring. At this period\r\nlittle oval or semi-cylindrical masses are frequently found adhering to\r\nfloating bodies, glittering and transparent as crystal. These are\r\nagglomerations of the eggs of Limnæa. When winter sets in, the _Limnæa_\r\nof our climate fall into a state of torpor, and sink, more or less\r\ndeeply, into the mud of the lakes, marshes, rivers, or brooks, which\r\nthey inhabit.\r\n\r\nThey are of great utility, both to feed fishes and aquatic birds, and\r\nalso as scavengers of the decaying vegetation of brooks.\r\n\r\nPlanorbis has an organization analogous to Limnæa, of which it is the\r\nfaithful companion in stagnant waters. Their shells (Fig. 189) are thin,\r\nlight, and disk-like in form, rolled round its plane in such a manner as\r\nto render all the turns of the spiral visible from above as well as\r\nbelow; it is concave on both sides, with an oval, oblong-shaped opening,\r\nand with an operculum or lid. The animal is conformable to the shell in\r\nshape. The visceral mass forms a very elongated cone, which unwinds\r\nitself absolutely, according to the spiral turns of the shell. The foot,\r\nor abdominal locomotive mass, is short, and very nearly round. The head\r\nis sufficiently distinct, and furnished with two very long filiform,\r\ncontractile tentacles, having at their base, and on the inner side, a\r\nsmall organ, which looks like an egg. The mouth is armed in the upper\r\npart with cross-cutting teeth, and in the lower part with a tongue,\r\nbristling with a great number of hooked excrescences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189. Planorbis corneus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nIn habits Planorbis resembles Limnæa: it creeps like it on the surface\r\nof solid bodies, and swims in the water with the foot upwards and the\r\nshell down. It feeds on similar substances, and its eggs are collected\r\nin gelatinous masses also. It passes the winter in a state of torpor,\r\nburied in the mud of the rivers it inhabits.\r\n\r\nThe principal species is _Planorbis corneus_ (Fig. 189) which is common\r\nin the rivers of England and France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190. Physa castanea (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nAnother group of molluscs, which occupy our fresh rivers, and swim with\r\nthe shell down and feet up, is represented by _Physa castanea_ (Fig.\r\n190). The genus _Physa_ have an oval, oblong, or nearly globular shell,\r\nvery thin, smooth, and fragile, opening longitudinally, narrow above,\r\nwith the right edge sharp; the last turn of the spiral being largest of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe animal appears to be intermediate in form between Planorbis and\r\nLimnæa: it is oval in form, and unrolls itself like the Limnæa, but its\r\ntentacles, in place of being triangular and thick like the latter, are\r\nelongated and narrow, like those of Planorbis. These little inhabitants\r\nof fresh water swim with facility, the feet upwards, the shell below,\r\nand like Limnæa, they feed on vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe fourth family, Limacidæ, containing Testacella and Limax, are\r\nterrestrial pulmonary molluscs, entirely naked, or having only a very\r\nsmall shell. The Limax varies very considerably in appearance, in\r\nconsequence of its extreme contractibility. When seen creeping along on\r\nthe surface of the soil, it has nearly the form of a very elongated\r\nellipse, at one extremity of which is the head; the surface of the body\r\nin contact with the earth is flat, the other convex. Towards the\r\nanterior extremity, and upon the middle of the back, a portion of the\r\nskin projects as if it were detached from the body, and is ornamented\r\nwith transverse stripes of various convolutions. This part is named the\r\ncuirass, or buckler, under which the animal can hide its head.\r\n\r\nThe mouth is a transverse opening in the front of the head; above are\r\ntwo pairs of tentacles, or horns, immensely retractile, cylindrical, and\r\nterminating in a small button; the lower tentacles are the shorter; the\r\nupper present at their summit a black point, as in _Helix_, which have\r\nsometimes been mistaken for the eyes.\r\n\r\nUpon the right side of the cuirass, and hollowed in the thickness of its\r\nedge, which is large and contractile, whose function it is to give\r\naccess to atmospheric air, it abuts on an internal cavity, also large,\r\nand is intended to promote respiration. The outer skin, or epidermis,\r\nis rayed in brownish furrows, its surface covered with a viscous\r\nglutinous substance, which permits of the animal creeping up the\r\nsmoothest surfaces, locomotion being produced by the successive\r\ncontraction and extension of the muscular fibres of the feet.\r\n\r\nThe internal organization of the Limax is analogous to that already\r\ndescribed in the snails. The taste and smell in the Limaceans differ\r\nonly very slightly from those organs in Helix. They are, like the\r\nsnails, deaf, and nearly blind. They love humid places; they lodge\r\nthemselves in the holes of old walls, under stones, or half-decomposed\r\nleaves, in the crevices of the bark of old trees, and even underground,\r\ncoming forth only at night and in the morning; especially after soft\r\nshowers in spring and summer. In the garden, after one of these soft\r\nshowers, many of these little creatures are sure to be met with in the\r\nmore shaded alleys.\r\n\r\nThe Limax is mostly herbivorous. They seek, above all, for young plants,\r\nfruits, mushrooms, and half-decayed vegetables. They are very voracious,\r\nand cause great ravages in gardens and young plantations, and many are\r\nthe devices of the watchful gardener to destroy them. Lime and salt are\r\ntheir abomination; ashes and fine sand they avoid. They dislike the\r\nnoonday sun, and the gardener knows it; he arranges little sheltering\r\ntiles, or planks of wood and stone, under which they retire, where they\r\nare surprised to their destruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191. Limax rufus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThere are thirty known species of Limax. Some are remarkable for their\r\nvery striking colours. _Limax rufus_ (Fig. 191) is common in woods, and\r\nwell known for its large size and its colour of rich yellowish red; it\r\nis known all over Europe, from Norway to Spain.\r\n\r\nAmong the Limaceans nearly destitute of shells we find _Testacella_\r\n_haliotidea_ (Fig. 192), which is provided with a very small shell\r\nplaced at its posterior extremity, just over the pulmonary cavity. This\r\nshell becomes more important in _Vitrina_, already spoken of as forming\r\nthe point of transition between Limax and Helix. This passage from\r\nLimaceans entirely destitute of shells to those furnished with a very\r\nsmall shell, as in _Testacella_, is very exactly indicated by Nature.\r\n_Limax rufus_, spoken of above, presents, under the posterior part of\r\nthe cuirass, calcareous, unequal, isolated granulations, which are, so\r\nto speak, the elements, as yet internal, of a shell which is on the\r\npoint of being built. Other species in the same genus present under the\r\ncuirass a little rough, imperfect scale, which seems to be produced by a\r\ngreat number of these calcareous granulations, which show themselves in\r\nan isolated state in _Limax rufus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192. Testacella haliotidea (Draparnaud).]\r\n\r\nThe Helicidæ is the fifth family we shall now consider.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to witness the snail as it creeps along the gravel\r\nwalks of a garden, or in the damp alleys of a park, in order to see that\r\nit is a being of higher organization than the headless molluscs. The\r\ncommon snail (_Helix aspersa_) goes and comes; it roams and saunters\r\nafter its own peculiar manner, searching for its food or its pleasure;\r\nit has a head and two prominent tentacles, which feel and seem to\r\nexpress their sensations; it has nerves, a brain, a strong mouth, and a\r\nwell-formed stomach.\r\n\r\nWithout possessing a high order of intelligence, the snail is by no\r\nmeans imbecile; it knows very well how to choose a tree the fruit of\r\nwhich is agreeable to it. A fine cluster of grapes, a succulent pear,\r\nwhich the horticulturist devours with his looks, and hopes to devour\r\notherwise, is sure to be the identical fruit which will be chosen by our\r\nenlightened depredator, the snail.\r\n\r\nThe body of the snail is oval, elongated, convex above, flat below. The\r\nconvex or upper surface of the body is rugged, in consequence of the\r\nexistence of numerous tubercles projecting slightly, and separated by\r\nirregular furrows; its anterior is terminated by an obtuse head, its\r\nposterior more flat and less pointed. All the flat portion, thick, soft,\r\nand upon which the animal moves itself by a creeping motion, bears the\r\nname of the foot. The head is not really very distinct, especially in\r\nthe upper part, but the organs with which it is provided are prominent.\r\nThese organs are in reality tentacles, although they are more popularly\r\nknown as _horns_, especially among children--those charming\r\nignoramuses--who have been taught to repeat the well-known stanza--\r\n\r\n    \"Snail, snail, come out of your hole,\r\n    Or else I'll beat you black as a coal\"--\r\n\r\nwhich finds its counterpart in all European languages. There are two\r\npair of these tentacles or horns; one pair quite in front and above, and\r\nanother smaller and less forward. The first are distinguished by their\r\nsize, and also by a black spot or point at their extremity, which is\r\nsometimes erroneously said to be the eye of the snail.\r\n\r\nThese tentacles differ in many respects from the same organs in other\r\nmolluscs; they are retractile, and can be drawn altogether within the\r\nanimal into a sort of sheath, by the contraction of a muscle. At the\r\nanterior extremity of the head we find a sort of plaited opening, which\r\nis the mouth: it is of moderate extent, closed in front by two lips, and\r\narmed with two shear-like organs of horny consistence, one of them being\r\na sort of rasp, which occupies the plate of the buccal cavity, and may\r\nbe called a tongue; the other is a median jaw, placed transversely in\r\nthe membranous walls of the palate, terminating in a free edge, armed\r\nwith small teeth. This cutting blade, however, executes no movement; but\r\nthe lingual organ, pressing all alimentary matter forcibly against its\r\nlower edge, effects their mastication, and enables it to dispose of\r\nfruit, tender leaves, mushrooms, and other substances easily divided.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the mouth is an oesophagus, or gullet, to which\r\nsucceeds a stomach of moderate size. The intestine lies in folds round\r\nthe liver, which is divided into four lobes, and terminates in a special\r\norifice.\r\n\r\nThe little lung of the snail is placed in a cavity, vast for its size,\r\njust above the general mass of the viscera, and occupies all the last\r\nspiral turn of the cavity.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of respiration is as follows: The animal inhales the air\r\ninto its lung by forcibly dilating the pulmonary orifice, which lies in\r\nthe largest spiral turn of the shell. In order to expel the air respired\r\nby the lung, it withdraws its body into the narrower part of the shell,\r\nwhere it gathers itself up completely, even to its head and feet, and by\r\nthis compression of all its little being it expels the air which fills\r\nit. These respiratory movements, however, are not regular, but succeed\r\neach other only at certain intervals. Life would be too hard for the\r\npoor snail were it passed in such violent efforts as would be necessary\r\nif it respired as the larger animals do. In its case the breathing is\r\nintermittent and imperfect; it is merely a rough attempt, as it were, at\r\nrespiration, which becomes perfect in some of the higher branches of the\r\nanimal kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe snail has a heart, consisting of a ventricle and auricle, connected\r\nwith a well-developed arterial vascular system, while the venous system\r\nis imperfect. In short, the blood only returns from the various parts of\r\nthe body to the respiratory apparatus, after traversing lacunæ, or\r\nair-cells, existing between the several organs.\r\n\r\nThe blood of the snail is of a pale rose colour, slightly tinted with\r\nblue. It has a rudimentary brain, composed of a pair of thick ganglions,\r\nsituated above the oesophagus, which are in connection with another pair\r\nof ganglions placed below, which, together, form a sort of collar, or\r\nring. From this ring springs a great number of nervous cords, which are\r\ndistributed to the mouth, the tentacles, the lung, and the heart. The\r\nskin, in those parts covered by the shell, exhibits great sensibility;\r\nit receives a considerable quantity of nervous filament, so that the\r\nsense of touch ought to possess extreme delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe tentacles, the skin of which is so fine and so sensitive, are the\r\norgans of touch. Other functions are sometimes attributed to them; the\r\nanterior tentacles are sometimes considered to be the organs of smell.\r\nThis, at all events, is certain, that the snail is very sensible of\r\nstrong odours, and is easily attracted by many plants the odour of which\r\npleases it.\r\n\r\nThe black points which terminate the first pair of tentacles have been\r\nconsidered as eyes: but the existence of a visual organ in the snail is\r\nnot quite certain. They are quite insensible to sudden changes of light;\r\nthey always travel in the dark, and never recognize obstacles placed\r\nbefore them. We may add that the snail is destitute of all organs of\r\nhearing. No noise appears to affect it, at least till the noise is so\r\nnear as to agitate the air which immediately surrounds it. Indeed, the\r\nsnail few has senses; the poor creature is at once blind, deaf, and\r\ndumb.\r\n\r\nThe snails are male and female in the same individual, or hermaphrodite.\r\nTheir eggs are roundish, heavy, and of a whitish colour. The animal\r\ndeposits them on the soil in little irregular heaps; at other times it\r\ndeposits them one after the other, like the grains of a chaplet, in\r\nholes which it digs in the soil, or in the natural excavations created\r\nby moisture. The eggs are even found in the hollows of old trees; in\r\nfissures of walls or rocks.\r\n\r\nWhen the young _Helix_ issues from the egg, it is already provided with\r\nan extremely thin membranous shell. The timid and tender youth is\r\nconscious of its weakness and full of humility. It rarely trusts itself\r\nout of the obscure hole in which it was hatched; when it does, it is\r\nonly at night, dreading the desiccating air, and, above all, the sun's\r\nrays, even with the house it always carries with it for shelter.\r\n\r\nThis calcareous and velluted house is spiral, which the animal has the\r\ninappreciable advantage of transporting without fatigue. It is light,\r\nand sometimes quite disproportionate to the body of the animal, which it\r\ncovers only in that part which contains the viscera and respiratory\r\norgans. The form of the shell is generally much variegated. Some are\r\nflattened, others are orbicular or globose; in some the spiral is very\r\npointed. The edges of the shell are sometimes simple, sharp, and\r\npointed; others, on the contrary, thick and inverted, presenting an\r\nedging of great solidity.\r\n\r\nThe spire is generally rolled up from right to left. A helix shell, the\r\nspiral of which follows the inverse direction, that is, from left to\r\nright, is a rarity much sought after by amateurs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ancients held snails in especial esteem for the table. The Romans\r\nhad many species served up at their feasts, which they distinguished in\r\ncategories according to the delicacy of their flesh. Pliny tells us that\r\nthe best were imported from Sicily, from the Balearic Isles, and from\r\nthe Isle of Capri, the last dwelling-place of the aged Tiberius. The\r\nlargest came from Illyria. Ships proceeded to the Ligurian coast to\r\ngather them for the tables of the Roman patricians. The great\r\nconsumption led to the establishment of parks (_Cochlearia_, Varro;\r\n_Cochlearum vivariá_, Pliny), in order to fatten the animals, as is now\r\ndone with oysters. They were fed for this end upon various plants mixed\r\nwith soup; when it was desired to improve the flavour a little wine and\r\nsometimes laurel leaves were added. These parks were formed in humid\r\nshady places surrounded by a foss or a wall. Pliny has even transmitted\r\nto us the name of the inventor of the _Cochleariæ_, a certain Fulvius\r\nHispinus. Addison describes with details one of these establishments\r\nkept up by the Capuchins at Fribourg in Switzerland, in imitation of the\r\ningenious Roman gourmet we have named.\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans, snails were served at the funeral repast. Certain\r\nheaps of their shells, which are found in the cemetery of Pompeii, are\r\nthe remains of those funeral festivities with which the inhabitants of\r\nthe buried city honoured the tombs of their friends and relations.\r\n\r\nThe practice of eating snails had fallen into disuse in Europe when, in\r\nthe seventeenth century, John Howard, the philanthropist, began to\r\ncollect them with the view of reintroducing them as human food. He chose\r\n_Helix Varronis_, which was probably the species cultivated by the\r\nRomans; it surpasses all those of Europe in size, and was found\r\nplentifully in the district of Bagnes, in the Valois. Howard, having\r\nprocured the species from Bagnes, found their increase so rapid that the\r\ncrops were likely to be devoured by the swarms of molluscs thus brought\r\ntogether, and steps were at once taken to destroy them. In other parts\r\nof Europe the snail continues to be sought for as an article of luxury.\r\nThey are consumed at Vienna in great numbers during Lent, supplies being\r\nbrought from the Swiss canton of Appenzell. At Naples a soup made from\r\n_Helix nemoralis_ is sold publicly to the strange population with which\r\nthe streets of that city swarm, for the king's pavement is their\r\nbed-chamber, dining-saloon, and work-room. In France, snails are a\r\nvaluable resource to the poor in the southern departments.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of all snails is not alike in a culinary point of view.\r\nAmateurs class as first in quality _Helix vermicula_, called at\r\nMontpelier the Little Hermit, because it buries itself so deeply in its\r\nshell. _Helix aspersa_ (Figs. 193, 194, 195) is thought to be more\r\ntender and delicate. In Provence a species is called _tapada_, that is,\r\n\"closed,\" from the cretaceous deposit with which it closes its shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193. Helix aspersa (Müller).]\r\n\r\nIn the north of France, and round Paris, _Helix pomatia_ is the\r\nfavourite culinary snail (Fig. 196). This is the species which is used\r\nas a speaking sign-board over the doors of the wine-shops and small\r\nrestaurants in the neighbourhood of the Halles, at Paris. Its shell is\r\nglobose and tun-shaped, very solid, marked with irregular transverse\r\nstripes of a brownish rust colour, with bands, often nearly effaced, of\r\na deeper tint, and of the same colour. The animal is large, of a\r\nyellowish grey, and covered with elongated irregular tubercles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194. Helix aspersa (Müller).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195. Helix aspersa (Var. Scalaris).]\r\n\r\nBesides _Helix pomatia_, according to Moquin-Tandon, they eat in the\r\nnorth of France _Helix sylvatica_ and _H. nemoralis_; at Montpelier, as\r\nwe have already said, _H. aspersa_ and _H. rhodostoma_; at Avignon,\r\nalso, these, along with _H. vermicula_, are favourites. In Provence,\r\n_Helix Pisana_, with _H. aspersa_ and _melastoma_, are preferred. At\r\nBonifacio, _Helix aspersa_, _H. vermicula_, and, more rarely, _H.\r\nrhodostoma_; and in other localities the smaller species and young\r\nindividuals of the larger kinds are employed for feeding poultry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196. Helix pomatia (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nCertain species are also employed for feeding ducks. Thus, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Montpelier, ducks are fed upon _Helix variabilis_ and\r\n_H. rhodostoma_. Some fishes, especially the young salmon, are very\r\npartial to the flesh of snails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197. Helix Mackenzii (Adams).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198. Helix undulata (Ferussac).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199. Helix translucida (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThis very important genera is very numerous in species, which are\r\ndistributed in groups according to the form of the shell; that is,\r\nwhether it be globulous, as in Fig. 197, tun-bottomed, as in Fig. 198,\r\nplain or biform, as in Fig. 199, or truncated, as in Figs. 200 and 201.\r\nThese figures will give the reader some idea of the multiplied and\r\nelegant forms which the shells of _Helix_ sometimes assume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 200 and 201. Helix Waltoni (Reeve).]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the snails (_Helix_), we shall note some kindred\r\ngenera which our space only permits us to name. Such is the genus\r\n_Bulimus_, the European species of which are numerous; some of them very\r\nsmall, others of medium size; of these, _Bulimus sultanus_ (Figs. 204\r\nand 205). In Figs. 206 and 207, the Berry Pupa (_P. uva_), as an example\r\nof another genus, is represented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202. Helix citrina (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203. Helix Stuartia (Sowerby).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 204 and 205. Bulimus sultanus (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nYet another typical species may be noted, which is found abundantly\r\namid the grass and shrubs near brooks round Paris and elsewhere. It is\r\n_Succinea putris_, presenting a small, thin, diaphanous shell of a pale\r\namber yellow, marked with close and very fine longitudinal stripes (Fig.\r\n208). The _Achatina zebra_ of Chemnitz is a great snail, which devours\r\nshrubs and trees in Madagascar (Fig. 209). Finally, _Vitrina_, the shell\r\nof which is very small and very thin in some species--so small, indeed,\r\nin _Vitrina fasciata_ (Fig. 210), that the animal cannot fully enter the\r\nshell--occupies a point of transition between _Helix_ and _Limax_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 206 and 207. Pupa uva.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208. Succinea putris (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209. Achatina zebra (Chemnitz).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210. Vitrina fasciata (Ed. and Soul).]\r\n\r\nIn the Pectinibranchial Gasteropods the gills are composed of numerous\r\nleaflets cut like the teeth of a comb, and attached, on one or many\r\nlines, to the upper part of the respiratory cavity. They constitute the\r\nmost numerous order of Cephalous Molluscs, comprehending nearly all the\r\nunivalve spiral shells, and many others which are simply conical. They\r\ninhabit the sea, rivers, and lakes, and are of all sizes. The most\r\nremarkable genera which we shall describe belong to the family of\r\n_Trochoïdæ_ and _Buccinoïdæ_.\r\n\r\nThe fourth order of Gasteropods, Prosobranchiata, which includes the\r\nPecteni Branchiata, is distinct in the sexes, has the branchiæ\r\npectinated, and the mantle forms a vaulted chamber over the back of the\r\nhead. It is divided into two sections and twenty-one families. The first\r\nsection, _Holostomata_, contains the sea-snails. The first family we\r\nshall treat of is the _Chitonidæ_, containing _Chitonellus_ and\r\n_Chiton_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211. Chiton magnificus (Deshayes).]\r\n\r\nThe _Chitons_ are very singular creatures, destitute of eyes, of\r\ntentacles, and without jaws; they bear upon their back in place of a\r\nshell a cuirass composed of imbricated and movable scales. They have the\r\npower of elongating and contracting themselves like the snails. They\r\nroll themselves up into a ball like the woodlouse. They adhere with\r\ngreat force to the rocks, preferring those places most exposed to the\r\nbeating waves. _Chiton magnificus_ (Fig. 211) is widely distributed.\r\n\r\nThe second family, _Dentaliadæ_, affords the curious _Dentalium_, or\r\ntooth shell.\r\n\r\nThe _Patellidæ_, or Limpets, constitute a very numerous family,\r\ndistinguished at once by the form and structure of the animal, and by\r\nthat of the shell. Linnæus called it Patella, _i. e._, a deep dish or\r\nknee-cap.\r\n\r\nThe shells of the Patellidæ, our third family, are univalve, oval, or\r\ncircular, non-spiral, but terminating in an elliptic cone, concave and\r\nsimple beneath, non-pierced at the summit, entire and inclined\r\nanteriorly. They are smooth, or ornamented on the sides with ridges\r\nradiating from the summit, and often covered with scales; the edges are\r\nfrequently dentate. The colours much varied. The interior is very\r\nsmooth, and remarkable for the brilliancy and lustre of its tints.\r\n\r\nThe head of the animal is furnished with two pointed tentacles or horns,\r\nhaving an eye at the external base of each. The body is oval and nearly\r\ncircular, conical, or depressed. The foot is in the form of a thick\r\nfleshy disk. Certain lamellar branchiæ are arranged in series all round\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nThe Limpets dwell upon the sea-shore, in the parts alternately covered\r\nand uncovered by the waves. They are almost always attached to rocks, or\r\nother submerged bodies, to which they adhere with great tenacity. If the\r\ncommon Limpet (_Patella vulgata_) is alarmed before any attempt is made\r\nto dislodge it, no human force, pulling in a direct line, can remove it,\r\nand it can sustain without being crushed a weight of many pounds. It\r\nholds on by the great quantity of vertical fibres of the foot, which in\r\nraising the median part forms in the centre a sort of sucker. It is the\r\ncelebrated experiment of the Magdeburg cups which these little molluscs\r\nrealise by their vital action.\r\n\r\nThese animals bury themselves in the chalky rocks to the depth of two or\r\nthree lines; when they are dispersed, they are observed constantly to\r\nreturn to the same place. Their movements are, besides, extremely slow;\r\nthe advance of the Limpet being only perceived by watching the slow\r\nupheaval of the shell above the plane of its position. It is supposed,\r\nfrom the mouth being armed on its upper edge with a large semi-lunar,\r\nhorny, cutting tooth, and in its lower part from having a tongue\r\nfurnished with horny hooks, and from their inhabiting in great numbers\r\nplaces covered with marine plants, that their food is chiefly vegetable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212. Patella cærulea (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213. Patella umbella (Gmel.).]\r\n\r\nThe poorer inhabitants of the coast eat limpets when they have nothing\r\nelse, but their flesh is singularly coriaceous and indigestible.\r\n\r\nThey are found in every sea; but are, however, found to be larger as\r\nwell as more numerous, and much richer in colour, in Equatorial seas,\r\nand especially in the southern hemisphere, than in European seas. They\r\nattain, in fact, their maximum of development here; for in the Straits\r\nof Magellan species are found as large as a slop-basin, which the\r\nnatives use for culinary purposes.\r\n\r\nThe common Limpet is thick, solid, oval, and nearly circular, generally\r\nconical, and covered with a great number of very fine stripes. Its\r\ncolour is of a greenish grey, uniform above, and of a greenish yellow\r\ninside. It is abundant in the Channel and on Atlantic coasts.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Limpet, _Patella cærulea_ (Fig. 212), from St. Helena, has an\r\noval shell, broadest behind, moderately thick, depressed, flattened,\r\ncovered with angular wrinkles, and dentate on the edge. It is of a\r\nspotted green outside and of a fine glossy blue within.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214. Patella granatina (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215. Patella barbata (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nOther very elegant species are _Patella umbella_ (Fig. 213), from the\r\nAfrican coast. _Patella granatina_ (Fig. 214), the ruby-eyed Limpet from\r\nthe Antilles; _Patella barbata_, the bearded Limpet (Fig. 215); and the\r\nlong spined Limpet, _Patella longicosta_ (Figs. 216 and 217).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 216 and 217. Patella longicosta (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe fourth family, _Calyptræidæ_, types _Pileopsis_ and _Calyptræa_, was\r\nclassed by the older conchologists with _Patella_. _Pileopsis\r\nHungaricus_, the Hungarian bonnet shell, is rather abundant on some\r\nparts of the British coast.\r\n\r\nThe fifth family, _Fissurellidæ_, contains _Parmophorus_, the\r\nduck's-bill-limpet of Australia, and _Fissurella_, the key-hole-limpet,\r\nwhich is remarkable for the opening of the apex of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe sixth family, _Haliotidæ_, contains _Ianthina_, _Scissurella_, and\r\n_Haliotis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218. Ianthina communis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe attention of naturalists has long been directed to a curious mollusc\r\nknown under the name of _Ianthina communis_ (Fig. 218); its body is\r\nglobular, and it presents an opening in front without contracting itself\r\nin order to form the head, which is long and trumpet-shaped, terminating\r\nin a large buccal opening, furnished with horny plates, and covered with\r\nlittle hooks; and two conical tentacles, slightly contracted, but very\r\ndistinct, each bearing at their external base a long peduncle. The foot\r\nis short, oval, divided into two parts: the anterior, concave and\r\ncup-shaped; the posterior, flat and fleshy. It is this foot, which bears\r\na vesiculous mass like foam, which gives its peculiar character to the\r\npretty mollusc. The mass consists of a great number of small bladders,\r\nwhich combine to keep the animal on the surface of the water. The shell\r\nis light, transparent, violet-coloured, and very much resembles the\r\nshell of the Helix. The _Ianthinas_ inhabit the deep sea, and often form\r\nbands of very great extent. Messrs. Quoy and Gaimard have seen legions\r\nof Ianthinas driven by the current. They have sailed during many days\r\nthrough these wandering tribes, which would be the sport of every gale\r\nif they could not, by drawing their heads within their shells and\r\ncontracting their natatorial vesicles, diminish their volume and\r\nincrease their weight at will, so as to sink quietly to the bottom of\r\nthe water till the tempest was over. The _Ianthina_ possesses a liquid\r\nof a dark violet colour, which is believed by many naturalists to have\r\nbeen one of the purple dyes known to the ancients, if not the purple of\r\nTyre: it is very common in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n_Haliotis_, the ear-shell, is remarkable for its brilliant colours, and\r\nfor a line of singular perforations in many of the species.\r\n\r\nThe seventh family, _Turbinidæ_, contains _Trochus_, _Turbo_,\r\n_Protella_, _Monodonta_, and _Delphinula_.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Trochus_ are found in all seas, and near to the shore in the\r\nclefts of rocks, especially in places where sea-weeds grow luxuriantly.\r\nSome of these thick, cone-shaped shells are extremely beautiful, being\r\nrichly nacred inside, and remarkable for the beauty and diversity of\r\ncolour exhibited. Generally smooth, the great spiral is, nevertheless,\r\nsometimes edged with a series of regular spines. The form is conical,\r\nthe spiral more or less raised, broad and angular at the base; the\r\nopening entire, depressed transversely, and the edge disunited in the\r\nupper part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 219. Trochus niloticus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220. Trochus virgatus (Gmel.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221. Trochus inermis (Gmel.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222. Trochus Cookii (Chemnitz).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223. Trochus imbricatus (Gmel.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224. Phorus conchyliophorus (Borfu).]\r\n\r\nThe animal which inhabits this shell is also spiral; its head is\r\nfurnished with two conical tentacles, having at their base eyes borne on\r\na peduncle; its foot is short, round at its two extremities, edged or\r\nfringed in its circumference, and furnished with a horny operculum,\r\ncircular and regularly spiral.\r\n\r\nThe family is divided into many sub-genera. Among the _Trochi_, properly\r\nso called, we may notice _Trochus niloticus_ (Fig. 219), _T. virgatus_\r\n(Fig. 220), _T. inermis_ (Fig. 221), and _T. Cookii_ (Fig. 222).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225. Turbo margaritaceus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226. Turbo argyrostomus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227. Turbo marmoratus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 228. Turbo undulatus (Chemnitz).]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Turbo_ are very generally diffused, being found on every\r\nshore, where they cling to rocks beaten by the waves. About fifty\r\nspecies are known, some of them large shells, others very small. _Turbo\r\nmargaritaceus_ (Fig. 225) is large, thick, and weighty, round-bellied,\r\nand deeply furrowed; in colour it is yellow, or rust-coloured, marked by\r\nsquare brown spots. _Turbo argyrostomus_, the Silver-mouthed Turbo (Fig.\r\n226), is still larger, with protecting spines on the top of its larger\r\nspiral. _Turbo marmoratus_ (Linnæus), the Marbled Turbo (Fig. 227), is\r\nthe largest shell in the group. It is marbled, green, white, and brown,\r\noutside, and superbly nacred within. The Gold-mouthed Turbo is so named\r\nfrom its nacre being of a rich golden yellow. The Wavy Turbo (_T.\r\nundulatus_), (Fig. 228), vulgarly known as the Australian Serpent's\r\nSkin. The shell is white, ornamented with longitudinal waving flexible\r\nlines of spots of green, or greenish-violet. _Turbo imperialis_ (Fig.\r\n229), from the Chinese seas, is green without, and brilliantly nacred\r\nwithin; it is vulgarly known as the paroquet.\r\n\r\nThe _Turbos_ are found in the North seas, in the Channel, and on the\r\nAtlantic coast. The animal is eaten in nearly all the sea-ports of the\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 229. Turbo imperialis (Gmel.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 230. Rotella Zealandica.]\r\n\r\n_Rotella Zealandica_, from the Indian Ocean, whose shell, represented in\r\nFig. 230, presents the most lively colours, forms one of a genus by no\r\nmeans numerous in species.\r\n\r\nNear to the _Trochi_ and _Turbos_ in the system are the _Monodonta_.\r\n\r\nThe _Monodonta_ are elegantly-marked shells, belonging to the seas of\r\nwarm countries. _M. Australis_ (Fig. 231) is a native of Australian\r\nseas. _M. labia_ (Fig. 232) is a small brown shell, with white spots,\r\nwhich is very common on the shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 231. Monodonta Australis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232. Monodonta labia (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe eighth family is _Neritidæ_, of which we give as types, _Pileolus_\r\nand _Nerita_. The hoof-shells, or Nerites, are numerous and pretty, and\r\nin external form approach _Turbo_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233. Delphinula sphærula (Kiener).]\r\n\r\nOf the _Delphinula_ only a small number of living species are known.\r\nThey are natives of the Indian Ocean, and remarkable for their numerous\r\nspines and the asperity of their shell (Fig. 233).\r\n\r\nThe ninth family, _Paludinidæ_, contains _Ampullaria_, the idol snail of\r\nIndia, and the widely distributed _Paludina_.\r\n\r\nOur tenth family, _Littorinidæ_, contains _Solarium_, and the\r\nperiwinkles, _Littorina_ and _Phorus_, example, _P. Conchyliophorus_\r\n(Fig. 224).\r\n\r\nThe genus _Imperator_ belongs to the _Turbinidæ_, and as examples of it\r\nwe may instance the Spurred Trochus, _Imperator stella_, which is\r\nstudded with radiating spines (Fig. 234), and _Imperator stellaris_\r\n(Fig. 235); they are natives of the Australian seas. _Imperator\r\nimperialis_, vulgarly called the Royal Spur, and _Trochus_ or _Rotella\r\nZealandica_ (Fig. 230), the New Zealand Spur, the spiral turns of which\r\nare sculptured in descending furrows, and studded with imbricated\r\nscales, which form a projecting edging round the margin of the shell,\r\nand give it a radiating form. This species is of a violet brown above\r\nand white below, and is still rare in collections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234. Imperator stella (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235. Trochus stellaris (Gmel).]\r\n\r\nThe Sun-dial (_Solarium_), recognized by its deep umbilicus, wide and\r\nfunnel-shaped, in the interior of which may be seen the little crenated\r\nteeth which follow the edge of every turn of the spiral up to the top.\r\nIn most collections of these pretty shells we find the Staircase-shell\r\n(_Solarium perspecticum_) of Lamarck, from the Indian Ocean (Figs. 236,\r\n237), the diameter of which is sometimes two inches and a half. The\r\nAustralian Sun-dial (_S. variegatum_, Linnæus, Fig. 238) is another\r\nspecies frequently seen in collections: it is as much variegated above\r\nas below, of a white and rusty brown. The minute trellised Sun-dial,\r\nwhich is only ten lines in diameter, comes from the coast of Tranquebar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236. Solarium perspecticum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237. Solarium perspecticum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 238. Solarium variegatum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239. Turritella replicata (Linnæus).\r\n\r\nFig. 240. Turritella angulata (Sowerby).\r\n\r\nFig. 241. Turritella sanguinea (Reeve).\r\n\r\nFig. 242. Turritella goniostoma.\r\n\r\nFig. 243. Turritella terebellata (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe eleventh family, _Turritellidæ_, types _Vermetus_ and _Turritella_,\r\nwhich last is a numerous family, being found in every sea. All these\r\nshells, as their name indicates, represent a winding pyramid,\r\nterminating in a sharp point, some of them having fluted spirals, others\r\nrounded, angular, or flat, and some of them elegantly pencilled. Figs.\r\n239 to 243 represent some of the varied forms they assume.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth family, _Melaniadæ_, types, _Paludomus_ and _Melania_,\r\nfresh-water genera.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth family, _Cerithiadæ_, types, _Aporrhais_ and _Cerithium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244. Cerithium fasciatum (Brug.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245. Cerithium aluco.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246. Cerithium giganteum (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n_Cerithium_ is a marine shell, which is found in muddy bottoms, on\r\nships, and more frequently at the mouths of rivers, but rarely beyond\r\nthe point to which the tide reaches. The genus is numerous in species.\r\nSuch are _Cerithium fasciatum_ (Fig. 244) and _Cerithium aluco_ (Fig.\r\n245).\r\n\r\nThe Giant Cerithium, _Cerithium giganteum_ (Fig. 246), is the living\r\nanalogue of a magnificent fossil species belonging to the tertiary\r\nformation. The single known example of this species belongs to the\r\nDelessert Museum at Paris. A manuscript note by Lamarck, attached to\r\nthis specimen, relates that this shell was first brought to Dunkirk in\r\n1810 by an Englishman, one of the crew of an English ship. The English\r\nsailor had drawn it up from the bottom of the sea with the sounding-lead\r\nfrom a bed of rocks off the coast of Australia.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth family, _Pyramidellidæ_, contains _Chemnitzia_ and\r\n_Pyramidella_, extremely pointed shells.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth family, _Naticidæ_, contains _Lamellaria_ and _Natica_;\r\nthe last of which is found in most seas.\r\n\r\nThe second section of the _Prosobranchiata_ is termed _Siphonostomata_,\r\nwhich are characterized by a spiral imperforate shell, the animal of\r\nwhich has sometimes a horny operculum, and is furnished with an elastic\r\ntrunk, the margin of the mantle acting as a siphon. They are\r\ncarnivorous.\r\n\r\nThe first family is the _Cypræidæ_, containing the well-known _Cypræa_\r\nand _Ovulum_.\r\n\r\nThe Cowries, or _Cypræa_, are brilliant, smooth, and polished,\r\noval-shaped, or oblong convex, with edges rolling inwards and\r\nlongitudinal openings, narrow, arched, dentate on both edges, and\r\nnotched at the extremities. The spiral, placed quite posteriorly, is\r\nvery small, and often hidden by a calcareous bed of a vitreous\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that the form and colouring of the shells vary very\r\nconsiderably, according to the age of the animal: so much so, indeed,\r\nthat the same species examined at various stages of its growth would\r\nalmost seem to belong to species and even to genera essentially\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThe young cowries are thin, conical, elongated; with conspicuous spiral,\r\nand large openings. The right edge soon becomes thicker, and folds\r\nitself inwardly; the opening is narrowed; finally, the spiral is\r\nunfolded in successive folds from the right edge, and by successive\r\ndeposits of the vitreous matter we have spoken of the opening is\r\ngradually contracted, its extremities hollowed out, its edges\r\ndisconnected, and the shell, until now only shaded in pale tints,\r\nassumes its most brilliant colours, disposed in bands or spots, as\r\nexhibited in PL. XXII., in which Figs. I. and II. are the adult shells,\r\nand Fig. III. the young shell, of _Cypræa Scottii_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXII.--Cypræadæ.\r\n\r\nAdults.\r\n\r\n    I. Cypræa Scottii.

(Linn.)\r\n    VIII. and IX. Cypræa argus. (Linn.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe animal which inhabits this shell is elongated, and is provided with\r\na well-developed mantle, furnished on the inside with a band of\r\ntentacles; it is able to fold itself up in its shell in such a manner as\r\nto be enveloped all round. The head is provided with two very long\r\nconical tentacles, each having a very large eye, in which a pupil and\r\niris can be distinguished. The foot is oval, elongate, and without\r\noperculum, and is well represented in _Cypræa tigris_ (Fig. 247). The\r\ncowries are found at a little distance from the shore, generally in\r\nclefts of the rocky bottoms; but sometimes they bury themselves in the\r\nsand. They are timid, shun the light, and only leave their retreats to\r\ncreep about in search of food, which appears to be exclusively animal.\r\nThese magnificent molluscs are natives of every sea. One small creature\r\nlives in the British Channel; another and much larger species is found\r\nin the Adriatic; but the Indian Ocean is the home of the largest and\r\nfinest species of these shells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247. Cypræa tigris (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 248. Cypræa coccinella (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nAs objects of curiosity and ornament these shells have been much in\r\nrequest in all ages. The inhabitants of the Asiatic coast make\r\nbracelets, collars, amulets, and head-dresses of them, and use them to\r\nornament boxes and harness. In New Zealand the chiefs carry a rare and\r\nchoice species, suspended from the neck, as a badge of their rank or\r\nsign of distinction. This is _Cypræa aurantium_. In some parts of India\r\nand Africa a very small species of Cowrie passes as current money. These\r\nshells are, indeed, extremely numerous, and we can only find room for\r\nvery brief descriptions of a few of the best known among them.\r\n\r\nThe Waving and Zigzag Cowries, whose native country is unknown, are\r\nbeautifully ornamented with waving and broken lines, as we see them in\r\nFigs. 249 to 252.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 249 and 250. Cypræa undata (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 251 and 252. Cypræa zigzag (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe New Zealand Cowrie, of which we have spoken above, is nearly\r\nglobular, of a uniform orange colour above, and white below; the teeth\r\nof the opening are of a bright orange. The shell is rare, and much\r\nsought after.\r\n\r\nThe Money Cowrie, _Cypræa moneta_ (Figs. 253 and 254), is a little oval\r\nshell, depressed, flat below, with very thick edges and slightly waving.\r\nIt is of a uniform yellowish white colour, sometimes citron-yellow above\r\nand white below. There are usually twelve teeth in the opening. It comes\r\nfrom the Indian Ocean, the Maldivian Isles, and the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 253 and 254. Cypræa moneta (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255. Cypræa Madagascariensis (Gmel.). (1 and 2).]\r\n\r\nThis shell, so common in collections, is gathered by the women on the\r\nshore of the Maldivian Isles, three days after the full moons and before\r\nthe new moons; it is afterwards transported to Bengal, to India, and\r\nAfrica, where, as we have already said, it is used by the negroes and\r\nother natives as money.\r\n\r\nThe Madagascar Cowrie, _Cypræa Madagascariensis_ (Fig. 255), and the\r\nGranular Cowrie, _Cypræa nucleus_ (Figs. 259 and 260), are beautifully\r\nmarked species, having the general appearance of the Cowrie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 256. Cypræa capensis (Gray).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 257 and 258. Cypræa testudinaria (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe species most abundant in the Channel is the little _Coccinella_,\r\nalready mentioned; it is very small, oval, tun-bellied, the opening\r\ndilated in front with smooth transverse stripes of greyish, tawny, or\r\nrose-colour, with or without spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 259 and 260. Cypræa nucleus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 261. Cypræa pantherina (Sol.).]\r\n\r\n_Cypræa mappa_ (PL. XXII., Fig. IV.) is oval-shaped, swelling below its\r\nsides, well-rounded, ornamented with small white spots below, with a\r\ndorsal branching line above; the interior is violet colour, with\r\nthirty-six teeth on one side, and forty-two on the other. It belongs to\r\nthe Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Harlequin Cowrie, _Cypræa histrio_ (Figs. V. and VI.), from the\r\ncoast of Madagascar, is ornamented with white spots very closely\r\narranged, and much circumscribed above, with black spots upon the sides.\r\nThe under side is violet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262. Natural size of Ovulum oviformis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nA very fine species, which is very common in collections, is found in\r\nthe Indian Ocean, from Madagascar to the Moluccas--the Tiger Cowrie,\r\nalready figured with its inhabitant. This shell (Fig. VII.) is large,\r\noval, tun-bellied, thick, and convex, of a bluish white, ornamented with\r\nnumerous broad, black, round spots, much scattered, and a straight\r\ndorsal line, brown above, and very white below. It has generally\r\ntwenty-three teeth on each edge, quite white. Somewhat resembling the\r\nTiger Cowrie is the _Cypræa pantherina_ (Fig. 261), which is perhaps a\r\nvariety of the same species. Another remarkable species is _Cypræa\r\nargus_, as represented in PL. XXII. (Figs. VIII. and IX.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 263. Natural size of Ovulum cornea (Lamk.).]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Ovulum_, so called from their egg-shaped form, occupy a place\r\nnear the cones in some systems. The shell is highly polished, white or\r\nrose-coloured, oblong or oval, convex, attenuate, and acuminate at the\r\nextremities without apparent spiral, the edges milled within the long,\r\nnarrow, and curved opening, with teeth upon the left edge, and with a\r\nfew ripples on the right edge. The Ovula are inhabitants of the Indian\r\nOcean and Chinese Seas. Some few species, however, belong to the\r\nMediterranean and the Black Sea. The three species represented in Figs.\r\n262, 263, and 264, present very singular contrasts of form and size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 264. Ovulum volva (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe second family, _Volutidæ_, contains _Mitra_ and _Voluta_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMITRA.\r\n\r\nThe Mitres are so called from their resemblance to the bishop's mitre.\r\nThey are natives of warm climates, such as the Indian Ocean, the\r\nAustralian Seas, and the Moluccas. The shell of the Mitra is long,\r\nslender, and spiral, the spire ending in a point at the summit; the\r\nopening is small, narrow, and triangular, and notched in front. The\r\ninhabitant of the shell has the peculiarity of projecting from its mouth\r\na sort of cylindrical trunk, which is long, very extensible as well as\r\nflexible, and probably prehensile, the use of which is only the subject\r\nof surmise. _Mitra episcopalis_ (Fig. 265), from the Indian Ocean, is\r\nwhite, ornamented with square spots of a fine red, and capable of high\r\npolish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 265. Mitra episcopalis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 266. Mitra papalis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n_Mitra papalis_ (Fig. 266) has dentiform folds round the opening, which\r\nalso crown each turn of the spiral; the spots are smaller, and much\r\nmore numerous and varied in form than those of _M. episcopalis_.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Voluta_, from _volvere_, to turn, the shell is oval, more\r\nor less tun-bellied. A spiral rising, slightly mammelate, the opening\r\nlarge, the edges notched, without channel; the columellar edge is\r\nlightly excavated and arranged in oblique folds. The right edge is\r\narched, thick, or cutting, according to the species.\r\n\r\nThe animal has a large head, provided with two tentacles. The mouth\r\nterminates in a thick trunk furnished with hooked teeth. The foot is\r\nvery large, furrowed in front, and projecting from all parts of the\r\nshell, but without operculum. The Volutæ live on the sands near the\r\nshore; sometimes they are found high and dry, left by the retreating\r\ntide. Their shells, of various forms, are ornamented with the most\r\nlively colours, the surface covered with irregular lines, the tint of\r\nwhich is generally in strong contrast with that of the ground.\r\n\r\nAmong the more remarkable species illustrated in PL. XXIII., we may\r\nnote: Fig. I., _Voluta undulata_; Fig. II., _Voluta cymbium_; Fig. III.,\r\n_Voluta delessertii_; Fig. IV., _Voluta musica_; Fig. V., _Voluta\r\nimperialis_; Fig. VI., _Voluta scapha_; and Fig. VII., _Voluta\r\nvexillum_.\r\n\r\nThe third family, _Conidæ_, contains _Pleurostoma_ and _Conus_.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Conus_ is especially rich in species, as well as numerous in\r\nmany individuals. They are much sought after by collectors, many being\r\nrare, and so command high prices. The shells belonging to this group\r\npresent a very remarkable uniformity of shape, at the same time that the\r\ncolours are very fine, and much varied in design. The shell is thick,\r\nsolid, inversely conical, wreathing spirally from the base to the apex,\r\nthe spiral being generally short, the last turn constituting alone the\r\ngreater part of the surface of the shell. The opening extends nearly\r\nalong its whole length, occupying all the height of the last whirl. It\r\nis always narrow, its edges quite parallel; the columella presents\r\nneither fold nor curvature; the right edge is plain, sharp, and thin,\r\ndetached from the front of the last spiral by a sloping hollow, more or\r\nless deep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII.--Voluta.\r\n\r\n    I. Voluta undulata. (Lamarck.)\r\n    II. Voluta cymbium. (Linn.)\r\n    III. Voluta Delessertii. (Petit.)\r\n    IV. Voluta musica. (Linn.)\r\n    V. Voluta imperialis. (Lamarck.)\r\n    VI.

(Chemn.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe animal which inhabits the Conus shell creeps upon a foot, elongated,\r\nnarrow, truncate in front, furnished behind with a horny rudimentary\r\noperculum, altogether insufficient to cover the opening. The head, which\r\nis large, is elongated into a little snout, or muzzle, at the base of\r\nwhich rises on either side a conical tentacle, having an exterior eye\r\nupon its anterior extremity. At the extremity of the muzzle is the\r\nmouth, which is armed within with numerous horny hooks, inserted in the\r\ntongue. A cylindrical syphon, reversing itself in the shell, serves the\r\npurpose of carrying water to the branchiæ or gills. The shells inhabit\r\nthe seas of warm countries, especially those lying between the Tropics,\r\nwhere they affect sandy coasts, with a depth of ten to twelve fathoms of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAmong the species bearing a spiral crown, we may mention the rare _Conus\r\ncedonulli_, of which several varieties are known, which come from the\r\nSouth American Seas and the Antilles.\r\n\r\n_Conus hebraica_, from the shores of Asia, Africa, and America, is a\r\ncommon species. It is white with black spots, which are nearly square,\r\narranged in transverse bands.\r\n\r\nIn PL. XXI. we have represented some interesting species. _Conus\r\nimperialis_ (Fig. I.) is a fine species, of white colour, with bands of\r\na greenish yellow or tawny colour, ornamented with transverse,\r\ncord-like, articulated lines of white and brown. One of the largest\r\nspecies is _Conus geographus_ (Fig. II.), which sometimes attains the\r\nlength of six or seven inches; it is shaded white and brown.\r\n\r\nAmong the non-crowned species, we have represented in Fig. III. _Conus\r\ntessellatus_, common in the Indian Ocean. Its anterior part is violet in\r\nthe interior. The spots with which it is surrounded are of a fine red or\r\nscarlet, or, in short, a red lead colour upon a white ground.\r\n\r\n_Conus ammiralis_, of which three varieties, Figs. IV., V., and VI., are\r\nnatives of the seas which bathe the Moluccas; they are beautifully\r\nmarked varieties, of a brownish citron colour, marked with white spots\r\nnearly triangular, with tawny bands painted in very fine tracery. This\r\nspecies has been, and is still, much sought after by collectors, and\r\npresents many varieties besides those represented.\r\n\r\nAmong the shells, which seem almost ready to become cylindrical, may be\r\nnoted _Conus nobilis_ (Fig. VII.), a rare shell of yellowish colour\r\napproaching citron, ornamented with white spots. The golden drop, _Conus\r\ntextile_ (Fig. VIII.), is yellow in colour, ornamented with waving\r\nlongitudinal lines of brown, and white corded spots edged with tawny\r\ncolour. The glory of the sea, _Conus gloria maris_ (Fig. IX.), is white\r\nin colour, banded with orange, and reticulated with numerous triangular\r\nwhite spots edged with brown. This is a native of the East Indies, and\r\none of the most beautiful shells of the whole group.\r\n\r\nThe fourth family, _Buccinidæ_, contains numerous genera, as examples of\r\nwhich we may instance _Oliva_, _Harpa_, _Cassis_, _Purpura_, _Nassa_,\r\n_Terebra_, _Eburna_, and _Buccinum_.\r\n\r\n_Oliva_ is so named from their resemblance in form to the olive. Their\r\nnearly cylindrical shell is slightly spiral, polished, and brilliant as\r\nthe Cowries; its opening is still long and narrow, strongly notched in\r\nfront, its edge columellar, swollen anteriorly into a kind of cushion,\r\nand striped obliquely in all its length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 267. Oliva erythrostoma (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 268. Oliva porphyria (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 269. Oliva irisans (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 270. Oliva Peruviana (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThese Molluscs belong to the seas of warm countries, where they frequent\r\nthe sandy bottoms and clear waters. They creep about with much agility,\r\nreversing themselves quickly when they have been overturned; they live\r\nupon other animals, and are flesh-eaters. They are, in fact, taken at\r\nthe Isle of Tranu by using flesh as bait. The colours of the shell are\r\nvery varied, and sometimes fantastically streaked. _Oliva erythrostoma_\r\n(Fig. 267) is ornamented externally with flexual lines of a yellowish\r\nbrown, with two brown bands, combined with the fine yellowish tint of\r\ngold colour within. _Oliva porphyria_, from the Brazil coast (Fig. 268),\r\npresents lines of a reddish brown, regularly interlaced with spotted\r\nlarge brown marks, upon a flesh-coloured ground. _Oliva irisans_ (Fig.\r\n269) is painted in zigzag lines, close and brown, edged with\r\norange-yellow, and with two zones of darker brown, and reticulated.\r\n_Oliva Peruviana_ (Fig. 270) is furrowed with regularly spaced bands.\r\n\r\nIn the casque, _Cassis_, the shell is oval, convex, and the spiral of\r\nconsiderable height. The longitudinal opening narrow, terminating in\r\nfront in a short channel, which becomes suddenly erect towards the back\r\nof the shell, as in _Cassis glauca_ (Fig. 271), a fine shell from the\r\nMoluccas. The columella is folded or toothed transversely, as in Fig.\r\n272 (_Cassis rufa_); the right edge thick, furnished with a sort of pad\r\nexternally, and dentate within. This shell is from the Indian Ocean, and\r\nis of a fine purple colour, varied with black above; the edges of the\r\nopening being of a coral red colour, the teeth alone being white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271. Cassis glauca (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 272. Cassis rufa (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 273. Cassis canaliculata (Brugières).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 274 and 275. Cassis Madagascariensis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe head of the animal is large and thick, furnished with two conical\r\nelongated tentacles, at the base of which are the eyes. The mantle is\r\nranged outside the shell, falling back upon the edges of the opening,\r\nand terminating at its anterior extremity in a long cylindrical channel,\r\ncloven in front, and passing by a hollow at the base into the bronchial\r\ncavity. The foot is large, and furnished with a horny operculum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 276. Cassis zebra (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThese animals keep near the shore, in shallow water. They walk slowly,\r\nand often sink themselves into the sand, where they prey upon small\r\nbivalves. They are not numerous in species; but specimens from the\r\nIndian Ocean are often large and beautifully marked. The shells of the\r\nless marked species are frequently used in India as lime; and employed\r\nas mortar, under the name of Chunam.\r\n\r\nOur space only permits us to mention, among the more curious, _Cassis\r\ncanaliculata_ (Fig. 273), two varieties of _Cassis Madagascariensis_\r\n(Figs. 274 and 275), and the curious _Cassis undata_ (Martini), _Zebra_\r\n(Lam.), or Zebra-marked Casque (Fig. 276).\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPURA.\r\n\r\nThe Purpuras have a classical name and history, having furnished the\r\nGreeks and Romans with the brilliant purple colouring matter which was\r\nreserved for the mantles of patricians and princes. The Purpura is an\r\noval shell, thick pointed, with short conical spiral, as in _Purpura\r\nlapillus_ (Fig. 277). In some it is tubercular or angular, the last turn\r\nof the spiral being larger than all the others put together. The opening\r\nis dilated, terminating at its lower extremity in an oblique notch. The\r\ncolumellar edge is smooth, often terminating in a point; the right edge\r\noften digitate, thick internally, and folded or rippled.\r\n\r\nThe animal presents a large head, furnished with two swollen conical\r\ntentacles, close together, and bearing an eye towards the middle of\r\ntheir external side. Its foot is large, bilobate in front, with a\r\nsemicircular horny operculum.\r\n\r\nThe Purpuras inhabit the clefts of rocks in marine regions covered with\r\nalgæ. On occasions they bury themselves in the sand. They creep about by\r\nthe help of their foot in pursuit of bivalves, which they open by means\r\nof their short snout. They are found in all seas; but the larger species\r\nand greatest numbers come from warm regions, more especially from the\r\nAustralian seas.\r\n\r\nThe Purpura of the ancients was not, as is generally thought, a\r\nvermilion red, but rather a very deep violet, which at a later period\r\ncame to have various shades of red. The secret of its preparation was\r\nonly known to the Phoenicians, that being most esteemed which came from\r\nTyre. An English traveller, Mr. Wilde, has discovered on the eastern\r\nshores of the Mediterranean, near the ruins of Tyre, a certain number of\r\ncircular excavations in the solid rock. In these excavations he found a\r\ngreat number of broken shells of _Murex trunculus_. It is probable that\r\nthey had been bruised in great masses by the Tyrian workmen for the\r\nmanufacture of the purple dye. Many shells of the same species are found\r\nactually living on the same coast at the present time.\r\n\r\nAristotle, in his writings, dwells upon the purple. He says that this\r\ndye is taken from two flesh-eating molluscs inhabiting the sea which\r\nwashes the Phoenician coast. According to the description given by the\r\ncelebrated Greek philosopher, one of these animals had a very large\r\nshell, consisting of seven turns of the spiral, studded with spines, and\r\nterminating in a strong beak; the other had a shell much smaller.\r\nAristotle named the last animal _Buccinum_. It is thought that the last\r\nspecies is recognized in the _Purpura lapillus_ (Fig. 277), which\r\nabounds in the Channel. Réaumur and Duhamel obtained, in fact, a purple\r\ncolour from this species, which they applied to some stuffs, and found\r\nthat it resisted the strongest lye. The genus _Murex_ is supposed to\r\nhave been the first species indicated by Aristotle.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time, the production of the purple remains a mystery.\r\nIt was long thought this fine dye was furnished by the stomach, liver,\r\nand kidneys; but M. Lacaze-Duthiers has demonstrated that the organ\r\nwhich secretes it is found on the lower surface of the mantle, between\r\nthe intestines and the respiratory organs, where it forms a sort of\r\nfascia, or small band. The colouring matter, as it is extracted from the\r\nanimal, is yellowish; exposed to the light, it becomes golden yellow,\r\nthen green, taking finally a fine violet tint. While these\r\ntransformations are in progress a peculiarly pungent odour is\r\ndisengaged, which strongly reminds one of that of assafoetida. That\r\nportion of the matter which has not passed into the violet tint is\r\nsoluble in water; when it has taken that tint it becomes insoluble. The\r\nappearance of the colour seems provoked rather by the influence of the\r\nsun's rays than by the action of the air. The matter attains its final\r\ncolour, in short, in proportion to the power of the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nIt is a question how far the colour evolved under the solar rays remains\r\nindelible. It is known that the contrary is the case with the colouring\r\nmatter of the cochineal insect, which changes very quickly when exposed\r\nto the sun. It is probably the remarkable resistance it opposes to the\r\nrays of the sun which recommended it to the ancients. The patricians of\r\nRome, and the rich citizens of Greece and Asia Minor, loved to watch the\r\nmagical reflections of the sun on the glorious colour which ornamented\r\ntheir mantles.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our humble shells. _Purpura lapillus_ (Fig. 277) is a\r\nthick shell, oval acute, with conical spiral, generally of a faded or\r\nyellowish white, zoned with brown, and more or less spotted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 277. Purpura lapillus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 278. Purpura patula.]\r\n\r\n_Purpura patula_ (Fig. 278) is very common in the Philippines, and is\r\none of the handsomest species; its geographical distribution has been a\r\nsubject of much controversy.\r\n\r\n_Purpura consul_ (Fig. 279) is one of the large shells, and of a fine\r\nsalmon colour, with brown bands and a corona of spines.\r\n\r\nThe _Buccinums_ resemble the Purpura in many respects. Their shell is\r\noval or conical, much notched in front. They inhabit every sea,\r\nespecially those of Europe. The animal has a small flat head, furnished\r\nwith lateral tentacles or horns, bearing the eyes upon an external\r\nswelling, situated near their central length. We need only refer to Fig.\r\n280, _Buccinum senticosum_, and _Buccinum undatum_ (Fig. 281), for their\r\ngeneral form, the well-known whelk of our markets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279. Purpura consul.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280. Buccinum senticosum (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281. Buccinum undatum (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe _Harpas_ are shells of the Indian Ocean, richly enamelled within,\r\nand ornamented externally with slightly oblique longitudinal stripes in\r\ngay colours, with finely-sculptured forms in the intervals; spiral very\r\nsmall, and opening large. Among the more attractive species are _Harpa\r\nventricosa_ (Fig. 282), _Harpa imperialis_ (Fig. 283), and _Harpa\r\narticularis_ (Fig. 284).\r\n\r\nThe fifth family, _Muricidæ_, contains _Fusus_, _Pyrula_, _Triton_, and\r\n_Murex_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 282. Harpa ventricosa (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe _Murex_, or Rock Shells, include a large number of species, all\r\nremarkable for their bright colours and somewhat fantastical and varied\r\nforms. They are found in all seas, but become larger and more branching\r\nin the seas of warm regions. The shell is oval, or rather oblong, the\r\nspire more or less elevated, its surface generally covered with rows of\r\nspines, or tubercular ramifications. The opening, which is oval, is\r\nprolonged in a straight canal, often of very considerable length, as in\r\nFig. 286 (_Murex haustellum_); the external edge is often smooth or\r\nrippled, the columellar edge sometimes callous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 283. Harpa imperialis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284. Harpa articularis (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe head of the animal is furnished with two horns or tentacles, ocular\r\nupon their external side, the mouth elongated in the form of a trunk.\r\nThe foot is large and round, and furnished with a horny operculum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 285. Murex tenuispina (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 286. Murex haustellum (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nAmong the species with long slender tube, covered with spines, one of\r\nthe most notable is _Murex tenuispina_ (Fig. 285), which is a native of\r\nthe Indian Ocean and the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nAmong the strong-tubed species with long canal and no spines, from the\r\nsame regions, is _Murex haustellum_ (Fig. 286).\r\n\r\nAmong the short-tubed species, furnished with foliaceous and jagged\r\nfringes, is _Murex scorpio_ (Fig. 287).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287. Murex scorpio (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 288. Murex erinaceus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nOne more typical species may be noted, namely, _Murex erinaceus_ (Fig.\r\n288), which is found on all the coasts of Europe, and especially in the\r\nChannel. Other species worthy of notice are found in the Mediterranean\r\nand the Adriatic, some of them, according to Cuvier and de Blainville,\r\nspecies which furnished the true Tyrian purple of the ancients; but our\r\nspace prevents us from dwelling on them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 289. Triton variegatum (Lam.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 290. Triton lotorium (Linn.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 291. Triton anus (Lam.).]\r\n\r\nThe _Tritons_ are ranged beside the genus _Murex_ in the system. Their\r\nshell is irregularly covered with scattered swelling excrescences, not,\r\nas in _Murex_, in longitudinal rows, but scattered all over the surface.\r\nAbout one hundred species of Triton are known. They inhabit many seas,\r\nbut more especially those in warm countries. _Triton variegatum_,\r\nvulgarly called the Marine Trumpet (Fig. 289), is a very large shell,\r\nwhich even attains a length of sixteen inches; it is enamelled with\r\ngreat elegance in white, red, and tawny-brown. They come from the Indian\r\nOcean, where they are very common. _Triton lotorium_ (Fig. 290) is of a\r\nreddish brown externally and white within. The _Triton anus_ (Fig. 291)\r\nis of a whitish colour, spotted with red.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 292. Fusus proboscidiferus (Lam.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 293. Fusus pagodus (Lesson).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 294. Fusus colus.]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Fusus_, or spindle shells, is distinguished by the elegance\r\nof its form rather than by the brilliancy of its colours. They are\r\nspindle-shaped, spire many-whorled, canal long, operculum egg-shaped.\r\nAmong the more remarkable species may be noted _Fusus proboscidiferus_\r\n(Fig. 292), _Fusus pagodus_ (Fig. 293), and _Fusus colus_ (Fig. 294).\r\n\r\nThe sixth family is _Strombidæ_, of which we give as types,\r\n_Rostellaria_, _Pteroceras_, and _Strombus_. _Strombus_ is a marine\r\nshell, belonging to Equatorial seas, of whose habits and manners very\r\nlittle is known. It is probable that they are long-lived, for their\r\nshells, when found perfect, have acquired a very considerable thickness\r\nand weight. They are even found encrusted in the interior with numerous\r\nlayers of soft earthy sediment, and covered externally with small corals\r\nand other marine productions. _Strombus gigas_ is represented in Figs.\r\n295 and 296.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 295. Strombus gigas (Linnæus), with the animal.]\r\n\r\nSome species of _Strombus_ attain great size, and are placed as\r\nornaments in halls and dining-rooms. In some of them the opening is\r\nbrilliantly shaded, and those are chiefly sought after to decorate\r\ngrottoes in gardens, or for collections of shells, where, from their\r\nsize, they necessarily occupy a prominent place.\r\n\r\nThese shells are tun-bellied, terminating at their base by a short\r\ncanal, notched or truncated; the right edge gets dilated with age;\r\nsimple on one wing, lobed or cuneated in the upper part, and presenting\r\nin its lower part a groove or cavity separated from the canal or from\r\nthe notch at the base. But these shells are not merely ornamental, for\r\nsome of the streets of Vera Cruz are said to be paved with _Strombus\r\ngigas_.\r\n\r\nThe animal which inhabits this shell presents a distinct head, provided\r\nwith a trunk or snout, and with two tentacles or horns, each bearing a\r\nlarge and vividly-coloured eye. The foot is compressed and divided into\r\ntwo portions, the posterior one, which is the longest, bearing a horny\r\noperculum. In the eagle-winged _Strombus_, represented in Figs. 296 and\r\n297, these several peculiarities are well developed. This shell is\r\nlarge, turbinate, distended in the middle, with an acutely-pointed\r\nspiral studded with conical tubercles, the right edge very broad,\r\nrounded off below. The opening is of a vivid rose purple fading into\r\nwhite. It is a native of the Antilles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296. Shell of Strombus gigas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297. Strombus gallus (Linn.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 298. Strombus luhuanus (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 299. Strombus cancellatus (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 300. Strombus thersites (Gray).]\r\n\r\n_Strombus gallus_, or the angel-winged (Fig. 297), veined with stripes\r\nof white and red, comes from the coasts of Asia and America. _Strombus\r\nluhuanus_ (Fig. 298) is fawn-coloured, marked with white, and externally\r\nthe right edge is red and striped; inside the columella is shaded purple\r\nand black.\r\n\r\n_Strombus cancellatus_, the trellised Strombus (Fig. 299), is small in\r\nsize and white in colour. _Strombus thersites_ is also represented (Fig.\r\n300).\r\n\r\n\r\nPTEROCERAS.\r\n\r\nThe Pteroceras, from πτερὸν, _wing_, and κέρας, _horn_, in many\r\nrespects resemble the Strombi. They are distinguished from them chiefly\r\nin this, that the right edge developes itself with age in long and\r\nslender digital spines more or less numerous, the numbers of which vary\r\naccording to the species. The Pteroceræ are found in the seas of both\r\nhemispheres, their vulgar denomination being sea-spiders or scorpions.\r\nA glance at the illustrations (Fig. 301, _Pteroceras scorpio_; Fig.\r\n302, _P. millepeda_; Fig. 303, _P. chiragra_; and Fig. 304, _P.\r\nlambis_) will satisfy the reader as to the general correctness of this\r\ndesignation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 301. Pteroceras Scorpio (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 302. Pteroceras millepeda (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe genus Pteroceras, whose remarkable form is so well calculated to\r\nexcite our admiration, has yet another attraction: the colouring of the\r\nshell exhibits many shades, which are particularly varied towards the\r\nopening, where it is generally distinguished by great freshness and\r\nbrilliancy, which, added to its other characters, render it the most\r\ninteresting of all the Gasteropods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 303. Pteroceras chiragra (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 304. Pteroceras lambis (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMOLLUSCOUS PTEROPODS.\r\n\r\n\"Natura non facit saltus.\" LINNÆUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe position of the Pteropoda is somewhat unsatisfactory. Their\r\norganization in some respects places them below the level of the\r\nGasteropods; but yet the general feeling amongst naturalists has been to\r\nassign them a place between the Gasteropods and the most highly\r\norganized of the molluscs, the Cephalopods. The number of genera and\r\nspecies is less than that of the other great classes of molluscs.\r\n\r\nThere are three principal Families of Pteropods. First, the _Cliidæ_,\r\ncontaining Cymodocea, Pelagia, Pneumodermon, and Clio. Second,\r\n_Limacinidæ_, containing Macgillivrayia, Cheletropis, Spirialis, and\r\nLimacina. Third, _Hyaleidæ_, containing Tiedemannia, Cymbulia, Eurybia,\r\nTheca, Cleodora, and Hyalea.\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristic of the Pteropoda is a membranous expansion\r\nsituated on the right and left side of their head, from which they take\r\ntheir name of Pteropoda, from ποῦς-πτερὸς, winged feet.\r\n\r\nThe wings or flappers with which they are provided enable them to pass\r\nrapidly through the water, reminding us strongly of the movements of a\r\nbutterfly, or other winged insect, and like them, their motions are long\r\ncontinued. They advance in this manner in a given direction, while the\r\nbody or the shell remains in an oblique or vertical position.\r\n\r\nThese little molluscs may be seen to ascend to the surface very\r\nsuddenly, turn themselves in a determinate space, or rather swim,\r\nwithout appearing to change their place while sustaining themselves at\r\nthe same height. If anything alarms them they fold up their flappers,\r\nand descend to such a depth in their watery world as will give them the\r\nsecurity they seek. They thus pass their lives in the open sea far from\r\nany other shelter, except that yielded by the gulf weed and other algæ.\r\nIn appearance and habits, these small and sometimes microscopic\r\ncreatures resemble the fry of some other forms of mollusca. They\r\nliterally swarm both in Tropical and Arctic seas; sometimes so numerous\r\nas to colour the ocean for leagues. They are the principal food of\r\nwhales and sea-birds in high latitudes, rarely approaching the coast.\r\nOnly one or two species have been accidentally taken on our shores, and\r\nthose evidently driven thither by currents into which they have been\r\nentangled, or by tempests which have stirred the waters with a power\r\nbeyond theirs. Dr. Leach states that in 1811, during a tour to the\r\nOrkneys, he observed on the rocks of the Isle of Staffa several\r\nmutilated specimens of _Clio borealis_. Some days after, having borrowed\r\na large shrimp-net, and rowing along the coast of Mull, when the sea,\r\nwhich had previously been extremely stormy, had become calm, he\r\nsucceeded in catching one alive, which is now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\"In structure,\" Mr. Huxley tells us, \"the Pteropods are most nearly\r\nrelated to the marine univalves, but much inferior to them. Their\r\nnumerous ganglia are concentrated into a mass below the œsophagus; they\r\nhave auditory vesicles containing otolithes, and are sensible of light\r\nand heat, and probably of odours, although at most they possess very\r\nimperfect eyes and tentacles. The true foot is small or obsolete; in\r\n_Cleodora lanceolata_ (Fig. 309) it is combined with the fins; but in\r\n_Clio_ it is sufficiently distinct, and consists of two elements or\r\n_spirals_; the superior portion of the foot supports an operculum. The\r\nfins are developed from the sides of the mouth or neck, and are the\r\nequivalents of the side-lappets (_Epipoda_) of the sea-snails. The mouth\r\nof _Pneumodermon_ is furnished with two supporting miniature suckers;\r\nthese organs have been compared to the dorsal arms of the cuttle-fishes;\r\nbut it is doubtful whether their nature is the same. A more certain\r\npoint of resemblance is the ventral flexure of the alimentary canal,\r\nwhich terminates on the under surface near the right side of the neck.\r\nThe Pteropods have a muscular gizzard armed with gastric teeth, a liver,\r\na pyloric cæcum, and a contractile renal organ opening into the cavity\r\nof the mantle. The heart consists of an auricle and a ventricle, and is\r\nessentially opisthobranchiatic, although sometimes affected by the\r\ngeneral flexure of the body. The venous system is extremely incomplete.\r\nThe respiratory organ, which is little more than a ciliated surface, is\r\neither situated at the extremity of the body, and unprotected by a\r\nmantle, or included in a branchial chamber with an opening in front. The\r\nshell when present is symmetrical, glassy, and translucent, consisting\r\nof a dorsal and a ventral plate united, with an anterior opening for the\r\nhead, lateral slits for long filiform processes of the mantle, and\r\nterminated behind in one or three points; in other cases it is conical\r\nor spirally-coiled, and closed by a spiral operculum. The sexes are\r\nunited, and the orifices situated on the right side of the neck.\r\nAccording to Vogt, the embryo Pteropod has deciduous vola like the\r\nsea-snails, before the proper locomotive organs are developed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 305 and 306. Hyalea gibbosa (Rang.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 307 and 308. Hyalea longirostris (Lesueur).]\r\n\r\nThe Pteropods seem to be eminently sociable and gregarious, swarming\r\ntogether in great numbers; they present some analogical resemblances to\r\nthe Cephalopodæ; but permanently they represent the larval stage of the\r\nsea-snails. De Blainville divides the group into two sections,\r\n_Thecosomata_ and _Gymnosomata_, the first including the _Hyaleidæ_ and\r\n_Limacinidæ_; the second contains one family, the _Cliidæ_. The Hyaleidæ\r\nhave small horny shells, very thin and transparent, globulous, or\r\nelongated, open anteriorly, cloven on the sides, and truncate at the\r\nposterior extremity. Their globular body is formed of two parts, the one\r\nincluding the head, bearing two very strong tentacles, and two large\r\nfins or flappers in the form of wings, springing from each side of the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nThese molluscs are small, and generally of a yellowish-blue or violet\r\ncolour. They are inhabitants of the deep sea, and rarely seen out of\r\nwhat sailors call \"blue water.\" They plough the waves with great\r\nrapidity by the aid of their powerful fins. Certain winds throw them\r\nsometimes in great numbers on the shores of the Mediterranean. These\r\nlittle creatures, so inoffensive, and which live together in vast\r\nnumbers, seem to be an easy and ready-prepared prey, which the great\r\nmarine animals may swallow by thousands. Twenty species of _Hyalea_ are\r\ndescribed as actually living in the Atlantic and Australian seas. Of\r\nthese _Hyalea gibbosa_ (Figs. 305, 306) and _Hyalea longirostris_ (Figs.\r\n307, 308) are here represented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309. Cleodora lanceolata (Lesueur).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 310. Cleodora compressa (Eydoux and Souleyet).]\r\n\r\nThe great flappers of _Hyalea tridentata_ are yellow, marked at their\r\nbase with a fine violet spot. Its shell, plain above, convex beneath, is\r\ncloven on the side. The superior part is longer than the inferior, and\r\nthe transverse line which unites them is furnished with three teeth.\r\nThis shell is yellow, and nearly translucent. When the animal swims, two\r\nexpansions of its mantle issue from the lateral clefts in the shell.\r\n\r\n_Cleodora lanceolata_ is a delicate and graceful creature; its body, of\r\ngelatinous appearance, has a distinct head, with its fins near the neck,\r\nnotched in the form of a heart (Fig. 309); its posterior part is\r\nglobulous, transparent, and luminous even in the dark. The animal which\r\ninhabits it sometimes shines through the shell like a light placed\r\ninside a lantern. This shell is triangular, as in _Cleodora cuspidata_\r\n(Fig. 311), thin, vitreous, and fragile, terminating in a long spine at\r\nthe base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 311. Cleodora cuspidata (Bucc.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCEPHALOPODOUS MOLLUSCA.\r\n\r\n\"Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens.\" VIRGIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe highest class of Molluscs is the Cephalopoda, which has been divided\r\nby Professor Owen into two Orders, _Tetrabranchiata_, or animals having\r\nfour branchiæ, and the _Dibranchiata_, having two branchiæ. The first\r\nFamily of the _Tetrabranchiata_, having the Ammonitidæ, contains the\r\nfossil Turrilites and Ammonites. The second Family, _Orthoceratidæ_,\r\ncontains the fossil Gomphoceras and Orthoceras. The third Family,\r\n_Nautilidæ_, contains Nautilus.\r\n\r\nThe name Cephalopoda, as already stated, is taken from the position of\r\nthe feet, which are inserted in the anterior part of the head: in Greek\r\nκεφαλὴ, _head_, and ποῦς-ποδὸς, _foot_.\r\n\r\nThe Cephalopodous Molluscs are indeed highly organised for Molluscs, for\r\nthey possess in a high degree the sense of sight, hearing, and touch.\r\nThey appear with the earlier animals which present themselves on the\r\nearth, and they are numerous even now, although they are far from\r\nplaying the important part assigned to them in the early ages of organic\r\nlife upon our planet. The _Ammonites_ and _Belemnites_ existed by\r\nthousands among the beings which peopled the seas during the secondary\r\nepoch in the history of the globe.\r\n\r\nThis great class is otherwise divided into two orders: _Tentaculiferous\r\nCephalopods_, those furnished with strong fleshy tentacula, and\r\n_Acetabuliferous_, or sucker-bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTENTACULIFEROUS CEPHALOPODS.\r\n\r\nIn place of bearing simple suckers (_Acetabula_), like the last order of\r\nCephalopods, this group is furnished with true organs of prehension, or\r\ntentacles. They differ from the first group chiefly in their more\r\nnumerous arms, which are quite tentaculiferous, having neither suckers\r\nnor capsules, and by having an external shell. The number of living\r\nspecies is extremely limited; for this group of animals belongs\r\npeculiarly to the earlier ages of our globe, is gradually becoming\r\nextinct, and presents in our days only some rarer species, when we\r\ncompare them with the prodigious numbers of these beings which animated\r\nthe seas of the ancient world. In fact, the only living type of the\r\norder is the nautilus, which has a singular resemblance in form to the\r\nargonaut.\r\n\r\nThe shell of this mollusc has a regularly convoluted form, the last\r\nwhorl being equal to all the others. It is divided internally into\r\nnumerous cells, formed by transverse partitions, concave in front and\r\nperforated towards the centre, and forming a kind of funnel, which gives\r\npassage to a respiratory siphon.\r\n\r\nIn the last cell of the shell (Fig. 312) is the animal, covered by its\r\nmantle, which covers the walls of the cells. When it contracts itself it\r\nis protected by a sort of triangular and fleshy hood. Numerous\r\ncontractile tentacles, re-entering into the sheath, some of them\r\nfurnished with numerous lamellæ, surround the head, which is, besides,\r\nscarcely distinguished from the body. The head bears two great\r\nprojecting eyes, planted upon a peduncle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 312. Nautilus pompilius (Linnæus), showing the\r\ninterior of the lower cell, to which the animal is fixed.]\r\n\r\nLike Sepia and Octopus, the mouth of the Nautilidæ is armed with\r\nmandibles, fashioned like the parrot's beak; the branchiæ are four in\r\nnumber. The circulating system consists of a ventricle and auricle, and\r\nthe locomotive tube is protected in its whole length. The shell is\r\nsecreted by the outer edge of the mantle, while its posterior extremity\r\nfashions the walls of the cells, which indicate the successive growth of\r\nthe individual.\r\n\r\nThe siphon, which traverses all the chambers, receives and protects the\r\nligament, by the aid of which the Cephalopod is retained in the last\r\nchamber of the shell.\r\n\r\nFig. 313 is the same section, with the last cell empty, and with the\r\nperforations through which the siphon passes.\r\n\r\nThe Nautilidæ are inhabitants of the Indian Ocean and the sea round the\r\nMolucca Islands. In swimming, their head and tentacles are projected\r\nfrom out of the shell. In walking on rocks they drag themselves along\r\nthe ground, the body upwards, the head and tentacles beneath. They\r\nbetake themselves frequently to miry cavities frequented by fish. It is\r\na much more common occurrence to find the empty than inhabited shells of\r\nthe Nautilus at sea. This, probably, arises from its exposure to the\r\nattacks of crustaceans and other marine carnivora. This seems to be\r\nproved by the mangled appearance of the edges in the empty shells thus\r\nmet with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 313. Nautilus pompilius (Linnæus) showing the lower\r\ncell and the partition giving passage to the siphon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 314. Shell of Nautilus pompilius (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe Pearly Nautilus, _Nautilus pompilius_ (Fig. 314), is so common on\r\nthe Nicobar coast that the inhabitants salt and dry its flesh, and store\r\nthem as provisions. Its shell attains about eight inches in its greatest\r\nheight. This shell is still used by the Hindoo priests as their conch or\r\nshell, with which they summon their devotees to worship. It is nearly\r\nround, smooth, transversely blazed in its posterior part, and entirely\r\nwhite anteriorly. A very fine nacre is yielded by this mollusc, which is\r\nmuch used in ornamental cabinet-work. The Orientals make drinking-cups,\r\non which they engrave designs and figures, which form graceful objects.\r\nSimilar vases were formerly shaped in Europe, which found their way into\r\ngreat houses. In our days they are generally consigned to cabinets of\r\ncuriosities and the shops of dealers in articles of virtù.\r\n\r\nOwen's second order, _Dibranchiata_, contains six families; the first is\r\n_Spirulidæ_, containing the curious Spirula, that little gem amongst\r\noceanic shells. The second family is _Sepiadæ_, containing Belemnosis\r\nand Sepia. The third is _Belemnitidæ_; the fourth, _Teuthidæ_; the\r\nfifth, _Octopodidæ_; and the sixth, _Argonautidæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nACETABULIFEROUS CEPHALOPODA.\r\n\r\nTo this group belong the cuttle-fish, squids, and argonauts, among\r\nexisting species, and the Belemnites among the fossil species. Some of\r\nthese creatures are large, and essentially flesh-eaters, or carnivorous;\r\nand, if we may believe all that has been written respecting them, very\r\nformidable ones. Listen to Michelet, while he paints the warlike humour\r\nof these inhabitants of the deep:--\"The Medusæ and Molluscs,\" says this\r\npopular author, \"are generally innocent creatures, and I have lived with\r\nthem in a world of gentle peace. Few flesh-eaters among them; those even\r\nwhich are so, only kill to satisfy their wants, living for the most part\r\non life just commenced--on gelatinous animals, which can scarcely be\r\ncalled organic. From this world grief was absent. No cruelty and no\r\npassion. Their little souls, if mild, were not without their ray of\r\naspiration towards the light, and towards what comes to us from heaven,\r\nand towards that love, revelling in that changing flame which at night\r\nis the light of the deep. It is now, however, necessary to describe a\r\nmuch graver world: a world of rapine and of murder; from the very\r\nbeginning, from the first appearance of life, violent death appeared;\r\nsudden refinement, useful but cruel, purification, of all which has\r\nlanguished, or which may linger or languish, of the slow and feeble\r\ncreation whose fecundity had encumbered the globe.\r\n\r\n\"In the more ancient formations of the old world we find two\r\nmurderers--a nipper and a sucker. The first is revealed to us by the\r\nimprint of the trilobite, an order now lost, the most destructive of\r\nextinct beings. The second subsists in one gigantic fragment, a beak\r\nnearly two feet in length, which was that of a great sucker or\r\ncuttle-fish (_Sepia_). If we may judge from such a beak, this monster,\r\nif the other parts of the body are in proportion, must have been\r\nenormous; its ventose, invincible arms, of perhaps twenty or thirty\r\nfeet, like those of some monstrous spider. The sucker of the world, soft\r\nand gelatinous! it is himself. In making war on the molluscs he remains\r\nmollusc also; that is to say, always an embryo. He presents the strange,\r\nalmost ridiculous, if it was not also terrible, appearance of an embryo\r\ngoing to war; of a foetus furious and cruel, soft and transparent, but\r\ntenacious, breathing with a murderous breath, for it is not for food\r\nalone that it makes war: it has the wish to destroy. Satiated, and even\r\nbursting, it still destroys. Without defensive armour, under its\r\nthreatening murmurs there is no peace; its safety is to attack. It\r\nregards all creatures as a possible enemy. It throws about its long\r\narms, or rather thongs, armed with suckers, at random.\" Such is the\r\nsomewhat exaggerated picture which the eloquent historian and poet draws\r\nof the Molluscous Cephalopod, and it must be admitted that there is a\r\nbasis of truth in this, as well as in the more recent one painted by\r\nVictor Hugo, in his eloquent book, \"Les Travailleurs de la Mer.\" Where,\r\nhowever, there is so much of the fictitious floating about, it will be\r\nour endeavour to eliminate facts only.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY OF THE SEPIADÆ.\r\n\r\nThe body of the cuttle-fish (_Sepia_) is thus a very singular structure,\r\nsomewhat reminding us of certain species of polyps. We find a body or\r\nabdominal mass, hand ahead, separated by compression, sufficiently\r\nmarked. The body is covered by the mantle, which has the form of a sac\r\nopened only in front by a transverse cleft. The head has a projecting\r\nand well-developed eye on each side; it is surmounted by a sort of\r\nfleshy funnel, which is divided by four pairs of tentacles. At the\r\nbottom of this tentacular funnel is the mouth; and from the anterior\r\nopening in the mantle a tube issues, which is wide at its base.\r\n\r\nThe Sepiadæ have eight arms rising from the crown of the head armed with\r\nfour rows of suckers, two long slender tentacles with broadly-expanding\r\nends, and stalked suckers; eyes moving in their sockets, and body\r\nbroadly ovate in Sepia.\r\n\r\nIf we study the general aspect of the animal more closely, we find that\r\nthe tentacles--which serve at once as organs of locomotion for swimming,\r\nfor creeping, and as prehensile organs for seizing and retaining its\r\nprey--are conical, very long, and all of the same form. Each of them has\r\ntowards its axis a longitudinal canal, which encloses a great nerve,\r\nwhich is also surrounded with muscular fibres, arranged in rays. The\r\nsuckers, already described, occupy all the internal surface of the eight\r\ntentacular arms, which are arranged in two rows, having the form very\r\nnearly of a semi-spherical capsule. Of these suckers, each arm of the\r\ncuttle-fish carries about two hundred and forty, the total number being\r\nnearly a thousand. The mouth we have already described, in Dr. Roget's\r\nwords: \"The teeth move vertically, much as the cutting edge of the two\r\nblades of a pair of scissors move upon each other, tearing the prey by\r\nthe assistance of their hooked terminations.\"\r\n\r\nThe tongue is covered on its upper part by a thick horny bed, bristling\r\nin the centre with a series of recurving teeth, while its edge is armed\r\nwith three other erect teeth, which are slender and hooked. The\r\noesophagus is long and slender. At the abdomen the gullet expands into a\r\nsort of frill, to which succeeds a gizzard, with strong fleshy walls;\r\nand, finally, a very short intestine, which directs itself forward,\r\nterminating on the median line of the body. Towards the anterior parts\r\nis a cavity, of which a few words must be said. It occupies the free\r\nspace comprised between the exterior surface of the abdomen and the\r\ninternal face of the mantle; and here the respiratory organs, namely,\r\nthe _branchiæ_, are lodged. Here, also, are the reproductive and\r\nexcretory organs.\r\n\r\nThe branchiæ, which are two in number, are voluminous, but short,\r\ntufted, and leaf-like. The branchial cavity can dilate and contract\r\nitself alternately. It communicates externally by two openings: the one,\r\nfashioned into a cleft, receives, while the other, which is prolonged\r\ninto a tube, serves to eject, the water, and becomes a powerful organ of\r\nlocomotion.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration of the animal is thus made by a cleft in the mantle, and\r\nexpiration by the tube: the renewal of the respirable liquid acts as a\r\nsort of sucking and forcing pump, at the surface of the lamellar\r\nbranchials. The cuttle-fish, in short, will be at no loss to reply to\r\nthe question of the Don Diego of Corneille--\r\n\r\n    \"Rodrique, as-tu du cœur?\"\r\n\r\nfor they have three hearts. The two first are placed at the end of the\r\nbranchiæ. With each beat of the pulse the venous blood is brought from\r\nall parts of the body, and propelled through each gill or branchiæ.\r\nVivified by respiration in the internal tissue of the branchiæ, it is\r\ncarried by the veins into the third heart, situated upon the median line\r\nof the body; and now the regenerated fluid is again distributed\r\nthroughout the rest of the economy.\r\n\r\nNot to oppress the reader with anatomical details, we shall just remark\r\nthat the gaze of the cuttle-fish is decided and threatening. Its\r\nprojecting eyes and golden-coloured iris are said to have something of\r\nfascination in them. The animal seems able even to economise the power\r\nof its glance, being able to cover its eyes from time to time by\r\ncontracting the skin which surrounds them, and bringing the two\r\ntranslucent eyelids with which it is furnished closer together.\r\n\r\nThe cuttle-fishes are essentially aquatic and marine animals. We find\r\nthem in every sea in all parts of the world; but they are most\r\nformidable in warm countries. They have a great predilection for the\r\nshore. During their youth they associate in flocks; but with age they\r\nfly from association, and retire into the clefts and hollows of the\r\nrocks. The old cuttle-fish is only found in rugged and rocky places,\r\nbristling with naked, pointed rocks, which have been worn by the waves,\r\nbut generally in places only a few feet below the level of low water.\r\n\"How often,\" says D'Orbigny, \"have we not observed the cuttle-fish in\r\nhis favourite retirement! There, with one of his arms cramped to the\r\nwalls of its dwelling, it extends the other towards the animals which\r\npass at its gate, embraces them, and by its power renders useless all\r\ntheir efforts to disengage themselves.\"\r\n\r\nIf we observe a cuttle-fish when it is what may be called walking,\r\neither on land or at the bottom of the sea, it will be seen to walk on\r\none side, its head downwards, its mouth touching the ground, the arms\r\nextended and grappling some supporting object, and drawing the body\r\nforward; at the same time the arms at the opposite side are contracted\r\nand folded up, so as to assist by a contrary movement. On shore the\r\nmovement of these animals is very slow. On the other hand, they swim\r\nvery rapidly, assisted by all their arms, and aided by the water ejected\r\nfrom the locomotive tube, their movement being most frequently\r\nbackwards, the body first, the six superior arms placed horizontally,\r\nthe two others brought together above: the first help to sustain them in\r\ntheir horizontal position, the last to guide them, inclining to the\r\nright or left as the animal changes its direction.\r\n\r\nThe cuttle-fishes feed on crustaceans, fishes, and also on shelled\r\nmolluscs--every kind of animal, in fact, which comes within their reach;\r\nso that it is readily taken by means of the flesh of fish or\r\ncrustaceans, in which a strong hook is concealed. They live for five or\r\nsix years, and reproduce by eggs, which are large, and generally found\r\nin clusters, known to fishermen under the name of _sea-grapes_.\r\n\r\nLike the zoophytes, they possess the property of redintegration, already\r\ndescribed, being able to reproduce any arm that may be destroyed. There\r\nis another singular peculiarity which the cuttle-fish shares with man.\r\nUnder the influence of strong emotion the human face becomes pale, or\r\nblushes, and in some individuals it is said to become blue. This has\r\nalways been supposed to be an attribute of humanity; but the cuttle-fish\r\nshares it with our race. Yielding to the impressions of the moment, the\r\ncuttle-fish suddenly changes colour, and, passing through various tints,\r\nit only resumes its familiar one when the cause of the change has\r\ndisappeared. They are, in fact, gifted with great sensibility, which\r\nreacts immediately upon their tissues, these being extremely elastic and\r\ndelicate. Sudden changes of colour are produced--changes which far\r\nexceed the same phenomena in man. Under the influence of passion or\r\nemotion man is born to blush, but under no sort of excitement does he\r\ncover himself with pustules; this the cuttle-fish does: it not only\r\nchanges colour, but it covers itself with little warts. \"Observe a\r\ncuttle in a pool of water,\" says D'Orbigny, \"as it walks round its\r\nretreat--it is smooth, and of very pale colour. Attempt to seize it, and\r\nit quickly assumes a deeper tint, and its body becomes covered on the\r\ninstant with warts and hairs, which remain there until its confidence is\r\nentirely restored.\"\r\n\r\nThe following fact is abbreviated from the \"Natural History and Fishery\r\nof the Sperm Whale.\" Mr. Beale had been searching for shells among the\r\nrocks in Bonin Island, and was much astonished to see at his feet a most\r\nextraordinary-looking animal, crawling back towards the surf which it\r\nhad just left. It was creeping on its eight legs, which, from their soft\r\nand flexible nature, bent considerably under the weight of its body, so\r\nthat it was just lifted by an effort above the rocks. It appeared much\r\nalarmed, and made every attempt to escape. Mr. Beale endeavoured to\r\nstop it by putting his foot on one of its tentacles, but it liberated\r\nitself several times in spite of all his efforts. He then laid hold of\r\none of the tentacles with his hand, and held it firmly, and the limb\r\nappeared as if it would be torn asunder in the struggle. To terminate\r\nthe contest, he gave it a powerful jerk; it resisted the effort\r\nsuccessfully, but the moment after the enraged animal lifted a head with\r\nlarge projecting eyes, and loosing its hold of the rocks, suddenly\r\nsprang upon Mr. Beale's arm, which had been previously bared to the\r\nshoulder, and clung to it with its suckers, while it endeavoured to get\r\nthe beak, which he could now see, between the tentacles, in a position\r\nto bite him. Mr. Beale describes its cold slimy grasp as extremely\r\nsickening, and he loudly called to the captain, who was also searching\r\nfor shells, to come to his assistance. They hastened to the boat, and he\r\nwas released by killing his tormentor with a boat-knife, when the arms\r\nwere disengaged bit by bit. Mr. Beale states that this Cephalopod must\r\nhave measured across its expanded arms about four feet, while its body\r\nwas not bigger than a large hand clenched. It was the species called the\r\nrock-squid by whalers.\r\n\r\nThese formidable and curious Cephalopods, the Μαλάκια of Aristotle,\r\n_Mollia_ of Pliny, and _Cephalophora_ of De Blainville, have the mantle,\r\naccording to Cuvier, united beneath the body, thus forming a muscular\r\nsac which envelopes the whole viscera. The body is soft and fleshy,\r\nvarying much in form, being sub-spherical, sub-elliptical, and\r\ncylindrical, the sides of the mantle in many species extending into\r\nfleshy fins. The head protrudes from the muscular sac, and is distinct\r\nfrom the body; it is gifted with all the usual senses, the eyes in\r\nparticular, which are either pedunculate or sessile, being large and\r\nwell developed. The mouth is anterior and terminal, armed with a pair of\r\nhorny or calcareous mandibles, which bear a strong resemblance to the\r\nbill of a parrot, acting transversely, one upon the other. Its position\r\nis the bottom of a sub-conical cavity, forming the base of numerous\r\nfleshy tentacular appendages which surround it, and which are termed\r\narms by some writers. These appendages in the great majority of living\r\nspecies are provided with suckers, _acetabula_ (cupping-glass-like\r\nappendages), by means of which the animal moves at the bottom of the\r\nsea, head downwards, or attaches itself to its prey. These suckers are\r\narmed or unarmed with a long, sharp, horny claw. In the unarmed\r\nacetabulum, the mechanism for adhesion is well described by Dr. Roget:\r\n\"The circumference of the disk,\" says this writer, \"is raised by a soft\r\nand turned margin; a series of long slender folds of membrane covering\r\ncorresponding fascicula of muscular fibre converge from the\r\ncircumference towards the centre of the sucker, at a short distance from\r\nwhich they leave a circular aperture; this opens into a cavity which\r\nwidens as it descends, and contains a cone of soft substance rising from\r\nthe bottom of the cavity, like the piston of a syringe. When the sucker\r\nis applied to the surface, for the purpose of adhesion, the piston,\r\nhaving previously been raised so as to fill the cavity, is retracted,\r\nand a vacuum produced, which may be still further increased by the\r\nretraction of the plicated portion of the disk.\" Here we have an\r\nexcellent description of the apparatus for holding on. When the animal\r\nis disposed to let go his hold, according to Professor Owen, \"the\r\nmuscular arrangement enables the animal to push forward the piston, and\r\nthus in a moment destroy the vacuum which retraction had produced.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of the armed Cephalopods (_Onychoteuthis_), Professor Owen\r\nremarks, \"that there are circumstances in which even the remarkable\r\napparatus described by Dr. Roget would be insufficient to fulfil the\r\noffices in the economy of Nature for which the Cephalopod was created,\r\nand that in species which have to contend with the agile mucous-clad\r\nfishes more powerful organs of prehension are superadded to the suckers,\r\nso that in the calamary the base of the piston is, he remarks, enclosed\r\nin a horny hoop, the outer and anterior margin of which is developed\r\ninto a series of sharp curved teeth, which can be firmly pressed into\r\nthe flesh of a struggling prey by the contraction of the surrounding\r\ntransverse fibres, and can be withdrawn by the action of the retracting\r\nfibres of the piston. \"Let the reader,\" the professor adds, \"picture to\r\nhimself the projecting weapon of the horny hoop developed into a long,\r\ncurved, sharp-pointed claw, and these weapons clustered at the expanded\r\nterminations of the tentacles, and arranged in a double alternate series\r\nalong the internal surface of the eight muscular feet, and he will have\r\nsome idea of the formidable nature of the carnivorous cephalopod.\" The\r\nprofessor notices another structure which adds greatly to the prehensile\r\npowers of the uncinated Cephalopods. \"At the extremities of the long\r\ntentacles a cluster of small, simple, unarmed suckers may be observed at\r\nthe base of the expanded part. When these latter suckers are applied to\r\none another, the tentacles are firmly locked together at that part, and\r\nthe united strength of both the elongated peduncles can be applied to\r\ndrag towards the mouth any resisting object which has been grappled by\r\nthe terminal hooks. There is no mechanical contrivance which surpasses\r\nthis structure; art has remotely imitated it in the fabrication of the\r\nobstetrical forceps, in which either blade can be used separately, or,\r\nby the interlocking of a temporary blade, be made to act in\r\ncombination.\"--_Cyc. of Anat._\r\n\r\nThe third Family, _Belemnitidæ_, contains Belemnitella and Belemnites,\r\nand other genera of less importance; they are all now extinct, although\r\nonce numerous as species.\r\n\r\nThe cuttles, _Sepia_ (Fig. 315), have the body fleshy and depressed,\r\ncontinued into a sac, and bordered on all its length on both sides with\r\na wing or narrow fin, the larger short and flat, broader than it is\r\nlong, with two large eyes, covered by an expansion of the skin, which\r\nbecomes transparent over a surface equal to the diameter of the iris,\r\nand furnished with inferior contractile eyelids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 315. Sepia officinalis (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThis head is surmounted by ten tentacular arms or feet, eight of which\r\nare short and conical, and two long and slender, terminating in a sort\r\nof spatula. These arms are all armed with suckers, and are perfectly\r\nretractile. They surround a mouth armed with two horny jaws not unlike\r\nthe beak of a parrot.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the cuttle-fish presents in one vast hollow, occupying all\r\nthe extent of the back, a great calcareous part, the form and structure\r\nof which is quite characteristic of this genus. It is known as the\r\ncuttle-bone (Fig. 316). This bone is used for many purposes; among\r\nothers, it is used in a powdered state as a dentifrice. It is sometimes\r\nsuspended in the cage with captive birds, that they may whet their beaks\r\non it, and collect phosphate of lime for the formation and repair of\r\ntheir bones. The osselet is oval or oblong, some provided with a\r\nslightly salient point. The upper part is surrounded with a horny or\r\ncretaceous margin, and presents in the centre a combination of spongy\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nMost of the Cephalopods secrete a blackish, inky fluid, to which some\r\nallusion has been made, but the uses of which, in the economy of the\r\nanimals, is imperfectly known. The cuttles have considerable quantities\r\nof this liquor, which is contained in a sort of sac or ink-purse, placed\r\nlow down in the abdomen. When the animal is pursued or threatened with\r\ndanger it discharges a jet of the fluid, which renders the water thick\r\nand muddy, and permits it to escape in the obscurity from its pursuers.\r\nIt appears that the cuttle-fish avails itself of this stratagem when\r\nleft accidentally ashore. It is related of an English officer, that,\r\nhaving dressed for dinner, and having some time to spare, he proceeded\r\nalong the shore on his favourite search for objects of natural history.\r\nHe reached a hollow rock in which a cuttle-fish had established its\r\nquarters; he soon detected the animal, which looked at him for some time\r\nwith its great prominent eyes; in short, they watched each other with\r\nfixed attention. This mute contemplation came to a sudden and unexpected\r\ntermination by the discharge of a voluminous jet of inky fluid, which\r\ncovered the officer, which was the more unfortunate, since he was in his\r\nsummer dress of white trousers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 316. Internal bone of Sepia officinalis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 317. Sepia tuberculosa (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nThe ink of the cuttle-fish is a favourite pigment, used in water-colour\r\npainting under the name of _sepia_. It is truly indestructible; and the\r\nhard and black substance found in the sac of fossil species of\r\ncuttle-fish when diluted with water produces a brilliant sepia. This\r\nproperty of the inky fluid was well known to the Romans, who used it in\r\nmaking ink. It was long supposed to be the chief ingredient in China\r\nink; but a recent traveller, Mr. Seebold, who has visited the\r\nmanufactory, and investigated the subject, has revealed the true process\r\nby which it is prepared.\r\n\r\nThe cuttle-fish affects the sea-shore; they are along-shore molluscs.\r\nThe flattened form of their bodies is favourable to a coasting life, by\r\npermitting them to rest easily on the bottom. Still they do not remain\r\nall the year round upon the coast. The cold in temperate regions, and\r\nthe opposite reason in warm regions, leads them to withdraw from the\r\nshore, to which they only return in the spring. They are rarely seen in\r\nthe Channel in winter, but with the vernal sun they appear in large\r\nshoals. What is the mechanism by which these animals are moved? When the\r\ncuttle-fish wishes to swim rapidly and backwards, they advance in the\r\nwater by means of the locomotive tube, sending back the ambient liquid.\r\nWhen they wish to approach a prey slowly in order to seize it, they swim\r\nby the aid of their fins and arms. In order to swim backwards, they\r\ncontract the arms provided with tentacles, and spread out horizontally\r\nthe arms without tentacles.\r\n\r\nThe cuttles are flesh-eaters, and tolerably voracious. They feed\r\nthemselves upon fishes, molluscs, and crustaceans. They are true aquatic\r\nbrigands, who kill not to feed themselves, but for the sake of killing;\r\nand Nature, by a just equilibrium, applies to them the _lex talionis_.\r\nThey fall victims, in their turn, to the vengeful jaws of the porpoises\r\nand dolphins. Such is the terrible law of Nature: some must die that\r\nothers may live. Michelet gives us a glimpse of the manner in which the\r\ndolphins dispose of the cuttle-fish in his \"Livre de la Mer.\" \"These\r\nlords of the ocean,\" he says, \"are so delicate in their tastes that they\r\neat only the head and arms, which are both tender and of easy digestion.\r\nThey reject the hard parts, and especially the after-part of the body.\r\nThe coast at Royan, for example, is covered with thousands of these\r\nmutilated cuttle-fish. The porpoises take most incredible bounds, at\r\nfirst to frighten them, and afterwards to run them down; in short, after\r\ntheir feast, they give themselves up to gymnastics.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring the cuttle-fishes deposit their eggs, but without\r\nabandoning them. On the contrary, they exhibit a truly maternal care,\r\ntaking much trouble to attach them to some submarine body, in which\r\nposition the temperature of the water serves to hatch the eggs. _Sepia\r\nofficinalis_, for example, chooses, at the moment of laying, a stem of\r\n_Fucus_, a foot of _Gorgonia_, or some other solid submarine body not\r\nless in dimensions than the little finger, and there it firmly attaches\r\nits eggs, which are pear-shaped, that is, pointed at one extremity,\r\nwhile a long _lanière_ of a gelatinous nature, flat and black in\r\nappearance, with which they are provided, surrounds the solid body like\r\na ring. Each female lays and attaches in this manner from twenty to\r\nthirty eggs, which are clustered together somewhat like a bunch of fine\r\nblack grapes (Fig. 318). About a month after this the eggs are hatched.\r\n\r\nThe colours of _Sepia officinalis_ vary considerably; but in general it\r\nmay be remarked that the males are ornamented with deeper colours than\r\nthe females. Transverse bands of a blackish brown furrow their backs,\r\nand diminish their breadth. Outside of these bands are small spots of a\r\nvivid white: very near the edge there is a white border, accompanied\r\ninside with a second edging of a beautiful violet. The median and\r\nanterior parts of the body are spotted here and there; beneath, a\r\nwhitish tint with reddish speckles prevails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 318. Sepia officinalis (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nThe cuttle-fishes are found on every shore, and wherever they are found\r\nthey are eaten, for their flesh is savoury. They are usually fried or\r\nboiled. They form an excellent bait for large ground-fish, such as\r\ndog-fish, rays, and congers, which are fond of their flesh.\r\n\r\nThirty species are known, and they are chiefly characterised by the\r\narrangement and form of the cupules of the arms. _Sepia officinalis_ is\r\ncommon on the shores of the ocean from Sweden to the Canaries, and in\r\nall parts of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe fourth family, _Teuthidæ_, contains _Loligopsis_, _Cranchia_, and\r\n_Loligo_.\r\n\r\nThe _Calmars_ were described by Aristotle under the name of Γείφις,\r\nand by Pliny under that of _Loligo_, which is still retained as the\r\ngeneric name. Their popular name of Calmar (calamar in old French) is\r\ntaken from their resemblance to certain species of ink-holders. Oppian,\r\nwho endowed the argonaut with wings, believed that the calmar also\r\ncould take to the air, in order to avoid his enemies. Nevertheless,\r\nhe was much puzzled how to give the form and functions of a bird to a\r\nfish. Themistocles, by way of insult to the Eretrians, likened them\r\nto calmars, saying they had swords and no hearts. Athenæus, a Greek\r\nphysician before Galen, dwelt upon the nourishing properties of the\r\nflesh of the calmar.\r\n\r\nCommon enough in temperate regions, the calmars abound in the seas of\r\nthe Torrid zone: they are gregarious, and live in numerous shoals, their\r\nbands taking every year the same direction, their emigration proceeding\r\nfrom temperate to warm regions--nearly the same course as that followed\r\nby the herrings and pilchards.\r\n\r\nThe calmars, like the cuttles, propel themselves backwards through the\r\nwater with great velocity, driving back the water by means of their\r\nlocomotive tube, moving with such vigour and promptitude that they have\r\nbeen known to throw themselves out of the water, falling on the shore or\r\non the deck of a vessel. They only appear momentarily on the shore, and\r\nonly sojourn there to deposit their eggs, which are gelatinous in\r\nsubstance, about the level of the lowest tides. The body in the calmars\r\nis longer than in the cuttle-fish, cylindrical in shape, and terminating\r\nin a point, having two lateral fins, which occupy the lower half or\r\nthird of its body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 319. Loligo vulgaris, with its pen, or internal bone\r\n(Lamarck).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 320. Loligo Gahi (D'Orbigny).]\r\n\r\nIn the common calmar, _Loligo vulgaris_ (Fig. 319), and the _Loligo_\r\n_Gahi_ (Fig. 320), we have two extreme forms represented, both taken\r\nfrom the magnificent work of MM. D'Orbigny and Ferussac, on the\r\n_Cephalopodes acetabulifores_. These molluscs are whitish-blue and\r\ntransparent, covered with spots of bright red. The osselet is\r\nlanceolate--that of the male elongated and somewhat resembling a\r\nfeather, that of the female much broader and more obtuse. Their head is\r\nshort, furnished with two large projecting eyes; the mouth is surrounded\r\nwith ten arms, provided with suckers, two of these being much longer\r\nthan the others, having peduncles or foot-stalks.\r\n\r\nThe internal bone of the calmar differs much from that of the cuttles;\r\nit is thin, horny, transparent, and somewhat resembling a feather, from\r\na portion of which the _barbs_ have been removed. Their food consists\r\nchiefly of small fishes and molluscs. With the greater fishes and\r\ncetaceæ they carry on constant war. They are caught and used for various\r\npurposes; along the coast they are eaten; the fishermen use them as\r\nbait, especially in fishing for cod.\r\n\r\nIt is no easy task to separate the real from the fabulous history of the\r\nCephalopods. Aristotle and Pliny have alike assisted, by their\r\nmarvellous relations, to throw that halo of wonder round it which the\r\nlight of modern science has not altogether dispelled. Pliny the Ancient\r\nrelates the history of an enormous cuttle-fish which haunted the coast\r\nof Spain, and destroyed the fishing-grounds. He adds that this gigantic\r\ncreature was finally taken, that its body weighed seven hundred pounds,\r\nand that its arms were ten yards in length. Its head came by right to\r\nLucullus, to whose gastronomical privileges be all honour. It was so\r\nlarge, says Pliny, that it filled fifteen amphoræ, and weighed seven\r\nhundred pounds also.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists of the Renaissance, such as Olaüs Magnus and Denis de\r\nMontfort, gave credit--which they are scarcely justified in doing--to\r\nthe assertions of certain writers of the north of Europe, who believed\r\nseriously in the existence of a sea-monster of prodigious size which\r\nhaunted the northern seas. This monster has received the name of the\r\n_Kraken_. The Kraken was long the terror of these seas; it arrested\r\nships in spite of the action of the wind, sails, and oars, often causing\r\nthem to founder at sea, while the cause of shipwreck remained\r\nunsuspected. Denis de Montfort gives a description and representation of\r\nthis Kraken, which he calls the Colossal Poulpe, in which the creature\r\nis made to embrace a three-masted ship in its vast arms. Delighted with\r\nthe success which his representation met with, Denis laughed at the\r\ncredulity of his contemporaries. \"If my Kraken takes with them,\" he\r\nsaid, \"I shall make it extend its arms to both shores of the Straits of\r\nGibraltar.\" To another learned friend he said, \"If my entangled ship is\r\naccepted, I shall make my Poulpe overthrow a whole fleet.\"\r\n\r\nAmong those who admitted the facetious history of the Kraken without a\r\nsmile, there was at least one holy bishop, who was, moreover, something\r\nof a naturalist. Pontoppidan, Bishop of Bergen, in Norway, in one of his\r\nbooks assures us that a whole regiment of soldiers could easily\r\nmanœuvre on the back of the Kraken, which he compares to a floating\r\nisland. \"Similior insulæ quan bestiæ,\" wrote the good Bishop of Bergen.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of his \"System of Nature,\" Linnæus himself admits\r\nthe existence of this colossus of the seas, which he calls _Sepias\r\nmicrocosmos_. Better informed in the following edition, he erased the\r\nKraken from his catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe statements of Pliny respecting the Colossal Poulpe, like those of\r\nMontfort about the Kraken, are evidently fabulous. It is, however, an\r\nundisputed fact that there exists in the Mediterranean and other seas\r\ncuttle-fish--a congenerous animal--of considerable size. A calmar has\r\nbeen caught in our own time, near Nice, which weighed upwards of thirty\r\npounds. In the same neighbourhood some fishermen caught, twenty years\r\nago, an individual of the same genus nearly six feet long, which is\r\npreserved in the Museum of Natural History at Montpellier. Péron, the\r\nnaturalist, met in the Australian seas a cuttle-fish nearly eight feet\r\nlong. The travellers Quoy and Gaimard picked up in the Atlantic Ocean,\r\nnear the Equator, the skeleton of a monstrous mollusc, which, according\r\nto their calculations, must have weighed two hundred pounds. M. Rung\r\nmet, in the middle of the ocean, a mollusc with short arms, and of a\r\nreddish colour, the body of which, according to this naturalist, was as\r\nlarge as a tun cask. One of the mandibles of this creature, still\r\npreserved in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, is larger than a\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 a gigantic cephalopod was stranded on the coast of Jutland. The\r\nbody of this monster, which was dismembered by the fishermen, furnished\r\nmany wheelbarrow loads, its pharynx, or back part of the mouth, alone\r\nbeing as large as the head of an infant. Dr. Steenstrup, of Copenhagen,\r\nwho published a description of this creature under the name of\r\n_Architeuthis dux_, shows a portion of the arm of another cephalopod,\r\nwhich is as large as the thigh-bone of a man. But a well-authenticated\r\nfact connected with these gigantic cephalopods is related by Lieutenant\r\nBayer, of the French corvette Alecton, and M. Sabin Berthelot, French\r\nConsul at the Canary Islands, by whom the report is made to the Académie\r\ndes Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe steam-corvette Alecton was between Teneriffe and Madeira when she\r\nfell in with a gigantic calamary, not less--according to the\r\naccount--than fifteen mètres (fifty feet) long, without reckoning its\r\neight formidable arms, covered with suckers, and about twenty feet in\r\ncircumference at its largest part, the head terminating in many arms of\r\nenormous size, the other extremity terminating in two fleshy lobes or\r\nfins of great size, the weight of the whole being estimated at four\r\nthousand pounds; the flesh was soft, glutinous, and of reddish-brick\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nThe commandant, wishing in the interests of science to secure the\r\nmonster, actually engaged it in battle. Numerous shots were aimed at it,\r\nbut the balls traversed its flaccid and glutinous mass without causing\r\nit any vital injury. But after one of these attacks the waves were\r\nobserved to be covered with foam and blood, and, singular thing, a\r\nstrong odour of musk was inhaled by the spectators. This musk odour we\r\nhave already noticed as being peculiar to many of the Cephalopods.\r\n\r\nThe musket-shots not having produced the desired results, harpoons were\r\nemployed, but they took no hold on the soft impalpable flesh of the\r\nmarine monster. When it escaped from the harpoon it dived under the\r\nship, and came up again at the other side. They succeeded at last in\r\ngetting the harpoon to bite, and in passing a bowling hitch round the\r\nposterior part of the animal. But when they attempted to hoist it out of\r\nthe water the rope penetrated deeply into the flesh, and separated it\r\ninto two parts, the head with the arms and tentacles dropping into the\r\nsea and making off, while the fins and posterior parts were brought on\r\nboard: they weighed about forty pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXIV.--Gigantic Cuttle-fish caught by the French\r\nCorvette Alecton, near Teneriffe.]\r\n\r\nThe crew were eager to pursue, and would have launched a boat, but the\r\ncommander refused, fearing that the animal might capsize it. The object\r\nwas not, in his opinion, one in which he could risk the lives of his\r\ncrew. PL. XXIV. is copied from M. Berthelot's coloured representation of\r\nthis scene. \"It is probable,\" M. Moquin-Tandon remarks, commenting on\r\nM. Berthelot's recital, \"that this colossal mollusc was sick or\r\nexhausted by some recent struggle with some other monster of the deep,\r\nwhich would account for its having quitted its native rocks in the\r\ndepths of the ocean. Otherwise it would have been more active in its\r\nmovements, or it would have obscured the waves with the inky liquid\r\nwhich all the Cephalopods have at command. Judging from its size, it\r\nwould carry at least a barrel of this black liquid, if it had not been\r\nexhausted in some recent struggle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this mollusc a calmar?\" asks the same writer. \"If we might judge\r\nfrom the figure drawn by one of the officers of the Alecton during the\r\nstruggle, and communicated by M. Berthelot, the animal had terminal\r\nfins, like the calmars; but it has eight equal arms, like the\r\ncuttle-fish. Now the calmars have ten, two of them being very long. Was\r\nthis some intermediate species between the two? Or must we admit, with\r\nMM. Crosse and Fisher, that the animal had lost its more formidable\r\ntentacles in some recent combat?\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe fifth family, _Octopodidæ_, contains _Eledone_, _Octopus_,\r\n_Pinnoctopus_, _Cirroteuthis_, _Philonexis_, and _Scærgus_.\r\n\r\nThe _Octopoda_, without tentacles, have eight long arms, united at the\r\nbase by a web; the suckers in two rows, which are sessile; the eyes\r\nfixed; shell, two short stiles enclosed in the mantle; the body united\r\nto the head by a broad neck-band; no side-fins; shell internal and\r\nrudimentary in the British species; body oval, warty, and without fins,\r\nin _Octopus_; small and oblong, arms tapering and webbed, and suckers in\r\na single row, in _Eledone_ (Fig. 321).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 321. Eledone, Octopus vulgaris (Lamarck).]\r\n\r\nIn his great work, Professor Owen proposes to divide the Cephalopods\r\ninto two groups, which he calls _Dibranchiata_, characterised by the\r\npresence of two branchiæ, which would bring together all the naked\r\nCephalopods, including Sepia, Loligo, Octopus, Kassia, and Ommastrephos;\r\nand _Tetrabranchiata_, having four branchiæ, to which the _Nautilus_,\r\nand most of the fossil Cephalopods, such as the _Ammonites_, belong.\r\nMost of the first group are represented in the British seas, but the\r\nsecond are altogether absent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 322. Octopus macropus (Risso).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 323. Octopus brevisses (D'Orbigny).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 324. Octopus horridus (D'Orbigny).]\r\n\r\nThe _Decapoda_ are of all sizes. Dr. Grant describes the body, or\r\nmantle, of _Sepiola vulgaris_, found on our coast, as measuring about\r\nsix lines in length, and as much in breadth, while the head measures\r\nfour lines in length, and, from the magnitude of the eyes, must be equal\r\nin breadth with the body. In _Onychoteuthis_, distinguished for its\r\nuncinated suckers, they are found of the size of a man. In Cook's first\r\nvoyages, the naturalists to the expedition, \"Banks and Solander,\" to\r\nquote Professor Owen's account, \"found the dead carcase of a gigantic\r\nspecies of this kind floating in the sea between Cape Horn and the\r\nPolynesian Islands, in 30° 44' S. lat., and 110° 10' W. long. It was\r\nsurrounded by sea birds, which were feeding on its remains. From the\r\nparts of this specimen which are still preserved in the Hunterian\r\nMuseum, and which have always strongly excited the attention of\r\nnaturalists, it must have measured at least six feet from the end of the\r\ntail to the end of the tentacles.\"\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Eledone_ the arms are reunited at their base by a very\r\nshort membrane, with only a single row of suckers. The two best-known\r\nspecies of this group inhabit the Mediterranean. The one is _Eledone\r\nmoschatus_, known in Italy under the name of Muscardino, from the strong\r\nodour of musk which it emits, even after death and desiccation; the\r\nother is _Eledone cirrhosus_, a small species, bluish-grey on the back,\r\nand whitish under the belly.\r\n\r\nThe habits of _Eledone moschatus_ have been carefully studied by M.\r\nVerany. The able naturalist of Nice preserved many of these animals\r\nduring a month, in a great aquarium, noting their habits. When in a\r\nstate of tranquillity, the _Eledone_ clung to the sides of the glass\r\ntank in which it was kept. Its head is then inclined forwards, with the\r\nsac hanging behind; the locomotive tube, turned upwards, presents the\r\norifice between the arms. In this state the animal is yellowish in\r\ncolour, its eyes dilated, its inspirations regular. But if irritated, a\r\nremarkable change takes place: its body assumes a fine maroon colour,\r\nand it is covered with numerous tubercles; the eye becomes contracted, a\r\ncolumn of water is forcibly ejected from the locomotive tube at the\r\naggressor, and the respiration becomes precipitate, jerky, and\r\nirregular. The creature would take a strong inspiration, and, having\r\ncollected its force, suddenly throw a jet of water to a distance of more\r\nthan three feet. This state of passion, which the slightest touch is\r\nsufficient to produce, endures for half an hour or more. When it ceases,\r\nthe animal resumes its form and primitive colours; but the least shock\r\nimpressed on the water is sufficient to give it a deeper tint, which\r\npasses like a flash of lightning over the skin of this singular proteus.\r\n\r\nThe Eledone sleeps by day as well as by night, attaching itself in its\r\nsleep to the walls of its prison, leaving its arms to float around, the\r\ntwo inferior ones extending backwards, and the sac inclining over them;\r\nits eyes are then contracted, and in part covered by the eyelids. Its\r\nrespiration is regular and slow, and any ejection of water very rare;\r\nits colour is then of a livid grey, and vinous red below, with whitish\r\nspots, while the brown spots have now entirely disappeared. While still\r\nasleep, it is watchful and attentive to all the dangers which could\r\nsurprise it. The extremities of the arms floating round its body are\r\nready to announce the approach or contact of any other object. Even the\r\nmost delicate touch is perceived immediately, and it shrinks from the\r\nhand which seeks to approach. Under every circumstance the Eledone\r\nexhales a strong odour of musk, which it preserves long after death.\r\n\r\nWhen the Eledone swims, which it rarely does unless pressed by some\r\nurgent necessity, it carries the sac in advance, the arms floating\r\nbehind--the six upper ones being on a horizontal line, the two others\r\napproaching each other below. Thus arranged, it presents, in consequence\r\nof its flattened form, a very large resisting surface to the water, its\r\nprogress being due to the alternate dilatation and contraction of the\r\nbody, which expels the water through the locomotive tube, and by\r\nreaction produces a rapid and jerking movement. Sometimes the arms aid\r\nthe movement; the eyes of the animal are then much dilated, and its\r\ncolour a clear livid yellow, finely shaded with red, and covered with\r\nbright spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 325. Pinnoctopus corolliformis (D'Orbigny).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 326. Cirrotheutis Mittleri (Eschricht).]\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that the creature notably changes colour under any\r\nexertion, so that the animal at rest and in motion are two different\r\nbeings. When walking under water the tube is directed behind, its arms\r\nare spread out, the head is raised, and the body slightly inclined\r\nforward; its mantle is then of a pearly grey, and the spots take the\r\ntint of wine lees. When at rest the shades disappear.\r\n\r\nThe _Pinnoctopus_ (Fig. 325), another genera of this family, have the\r\nbody oblong, with lateral expansions, as represented in the accompanying\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nIn _Cirrotheutis_ the arms are completely united in their whole extent\r\nby a thin membrane furnished with cirri, which alternate with certain\r\nsuckers arranged in one row. Only one species of this genera is known as\r\nan inhabitant of northern seas, which is represented in Fig. 326.\r\n\r\nThe sixth family, _Argonautidæ_, contains only _Argonauta_.\r\n\r\nThe Argonauta, or Paper-nautilus. Floating gracefully on the surface of\r\nthe sea, trimming its tiny sail to the breeze, just sufficient to ruffle\r\nthe surface of the waves, behold the exquisite living shallop. The\r\nelegant little bark which thus plays with the current is no work of\r\nhuman hands, but a child of Nature: it is the Argonaut, whose tribes,\r\ndecked in a thousand brilliant shades of colour, are wanderers of the\r\nnight in innumerable swarms on the ocean's surface.\r\n\r\nThe marine shell which Linnæus called the Argonaut enjoyed great renown\r\namong the ancient Greeks and Romans. It was the subject of graceful\r\nlegends; it had inspired great poets; it occupied the attention of\r\nAristotle, who called it the _Nautilus_ and _Nauticos_, and of Pliny,\r\nwho called it _Pompylius_. Few animals, indeed, have been so celebrated,\r\nso anciently known. The Greek and Roman poets saw in it an elegant model\r\nof the ship which the skill and audacity of the man constructed who\r\nfirst braved the fury of the waves; in the words of the poet, \"armour of\r\ntriple oak and triple brass covered the heart of him who first confided\r\nhimself in a frail bark to the relentless waves:\"\r\n\r\n    \"Illi robur et æs triplex\r\n      Circa pectus erat, qui fragilem truci\r\n    Commisit pelago ratem\r\n      Primus....\"\r\n\r\n    _Horace_, I. Car. iii. l. 9.\r\n\r\nTo meet the Pompylius was, according to the superstitious Roman, a\r\nfavourable presage. This little oceanic wanderer, in spite of the\r\ncapricious waves, was a tutelar divinity, who guarded the navigator in\r\nhis course, and assured him of a happy passage. Listen to the immortal\r\nauthor of the first Natural History of Animals, the philosophical\r\nAristotle. \"The Nautilus Polyp,\" says the learned historian, \"is of the\r\nnature of animals which pass for extraordinary, for it can float on the\r\nsea; it raises itself from the bottom of the water, the shell being\r\nreversed and empty, but when it reaches the surface it readjusts it. It\r\nhas between the arms a species of tissue similar to that which unites\r\nthe toes of web-footed birds. When there is a little wind, it employs\r\nthis tissue as a sort of rudder, letting it fall into the water with the\r\narms on each side. On the approach of the least danger it fills its\r\nshell with water, and sinks into the sea.\"\r\n\r\nPliny gives it the name of Pompylius, and, after the example of\r\nAristotle, explains how it navigates, by elevating its two first arms, a\r\nmembrane of extreme tenuity stretching between them, while it rows with\r\nthe others, using its median arm as a rudder. The Greek poet, Oppian,\r\nwho lived in the second century of our era, and to whom we are indebted\r\nfor Poems on Fishing (_Halieutica_) and the Chase (_Cynegetica_), says\r\nof it: \"Hiding itself in a concave shell, the Pompylius can walk on\r\nland, but can also rise to the surface of the water, the back of its\r\nshell upwards, for fear that it should be filled. The moment it is seen,\r\nit turns the shell, and navigates it like a skilful seaman: in order to\r\ndo this, it throws out two of its feet like antennæ between which is a\r\nthin membrane, which is extended by the wind like a sail, while two\r\nothers, which touch the water, guide, as with a rudder, the house, the\r\nship, and the animal. If danger approaches, it folds up its antennæ, its\r\nsail, and its rudder, and dives, its weight being increased by the water\r\nwhich it causes to enter the shell. As we see a man who is victor in the\r\npublic games, his head circled by a crown, while vast crowds press\r\naround, so the Pompylius have always a crowd of ships following in their\r\ntrack, whose crews no longer dread to quit the land. O fish justly dear\r\nto navigators! thy presence announces winds soft and friendly: thou\r\nbringest the calm, and thou art the sign of it.\"\r\n\r\nOppian carried his admiration a long way. That the Argonaut is an\r\nanimated skiff is agreed on all hands; but, in making it almost a\r\nbird--in according to it at once the faculty of gracefully navigating\r\nthe sea and floating in the atmosphere as an inhabitant of the regions\r\nof air--he was passing the limits permissible to poetic license.\r\n\r\nBut the properties of the Nautilus has not alone struck the imagination\r\nof the Greeks and Romans; it also attracted the attention of the\r\nChinese, who call it the boat-polyp. Rumphius informs us, that in India\r\nthe shell fetches a great price (Fig. 327). Women consider it a great, a\r\nmagnificent ornament. In their solemn fêtes dancers carry one of these\r\nshells in the right hand, holding it proudly above their heads. Nor did\r\nit require the dithyrambic praises with which the ancients have\r\nsurrounded it to recommend it to the admiration of modern naturalists.\r\nWithout exaggerating the graceful attributes with which it is gifted, it\r\nis at once one of the most curious objects in Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 327. Shell of Argonauta argo (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 328. The Argonauta argo (Linnæus).]\r\n\r\nIts body (Fig. 328) is ovoid in form, and it is furnished with eight\r\ntentacles, covered with a double row of suckers. Of these tentacles, six\r\nare narrow and slender, tapering to a point towards the extremity, while\r\ntwo of them expand toward the extremity in the form of wings or sails.\r\nThese are all folded up when in a state of repose. The body itself is\r\ncontained in a thin, white, and fragile univalve shell, which is oval,\r\nflattened on the exterior, but rolled up in a spiral in the interior,\r\nthe last turn of the shell being so large as to give it something of the\r\nform of an elegantly-shaped shallop. Singularly enough, the body of the\r\nanimal does not penetrate to the bottom of the shell, nor is it attached\r\nto it by any muscular ligament; nor is the shell moulded exactly upon\r\nit, as is the case with most other testaceans.\r\n\r\nWhat does all this imply? Is the Argonaut a parasite? a fraudulent\r\ndisinheritor? a vile assassin, who, having surprised and killed the\r\nlegitimate proprietor of the shell, has installed itself in its place,\r\nand in the proper house of its victim? Such crimes are not without\r\nexample in the natural history of animals--witness the proceedings of\r\nthe curious _hermit crab_, whose proceedings we shall glance at in a\r\nfuture chapter. The parasitic character of the Nautilus was long\r\nconceded by naturalists; but recent facts have corrected this opinion.\r\nWe have collected their shells, of all dimensions and of all ages,\r\ninhabited always by the same animal, whose size is always proportioned\r\nto the volume of the shell. More than that, it is now known that in the\r\negg of the Nautilus the rudiments of the shell exist. M. Chenu tells us,\r\nthat under the microscope Professor Duvernoy discovered a distinct shell\r\ncontained in the embryo. Sir Everard Home asserts the contrary; and no\r\nopportunity presented itself for the complete solution of the question,\r\nuntil Poli was placed by the King of Naples in a position to solve it.\r\nThe piscina of Portici was placed at his disposal. He witnessed the\r\ncurious mechanism by which the egg is expelled from the uterus, having a\r\nshell, and satisfied himself, by following their development day by day,\r\nthat the shell existed in the embryo, and grew with the animal. He\r\nsatisfied himself also that the opinion enunciated by Aristotle, that at\r\nno point did the animal adhere to the shell, was perfectly true.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the curious series of experiments carried on by Madame\r\nPower, in the port of Messina, the fragments of the frail bark of the\r\nmollusc, which were broken off in taking it, were restored in a few\r\ndays, having been reproduced. It is, therefore, quite demonstrated that\r\nthe Nautilus, like other testaceous molluscs, itself secretes and\r\nconstructs its shell--its diaphanous skiff. The reader, however, must\r\nnot flatter himself that he can witness with his own eyes from the\r\nshore, in our narrow channel, the charming picture of the Nautilus\r\npainted by poets and natural historians: they never come near the shore.\r\nThey are timid and cautious creatures, dwelling almost always in the\r\nopen sea. They live in families, some hundreds of miles from the shore;\r\nand it is during the night, or at most in the fading light of sunset,\r\nthat they assemble together to pursue their gambols on the surface of a\r\ntranquil sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 329. Argonauta papyracea, as it swims by means of\r\nits locomotive tube.]\r\n\r\nHowever reluctant we may be to destroy the marvellous fictions of\r\nancients and moderns, we are compelled to declare that there is no truth\r\nin the often-repeated statement that the Nautilus uses its palmated arms\r\nas oars or sails. In order to swim on the surface, it comports itself as\r\nall other Cephalopods do. It uses neither oars nor sails, and the\r\npalmate arms only serve to envelop and retain its hold on its frail\r\nshell. Its principal apparatus of progression is the _locomotive tube_\r\nwith which it is furnished, in common with all Cephalopods, and which is\r\nin the Nautilus very long. Aided by this apparatus, it ejects the water\r\nafter it has served the purpose of respiration, and, in doing so,\r\nprojects itself against the liquid, as it were. While it advances\r\nthrough the water under this impulse, its pendent arms, elongated and\r\nreunited in bundles, extend the whole length of the shell. Fig. 329\r\nshows the position of the different parts of the animal when it thus\r\nbreasts the waves. These arms are also powerful aids when the animal\r\ncreeps on the ground at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 330. Argonauta papyracea in its shell.]\r\n\r\nWhen the animal is disturbed it retires completely into its shell. From\r\nthat moment, the equilibrium being changed, the shell is overturned, and\r\nthe animal is nearly invisible. If frightened, it entirely submerges\r\nitself, and sinks to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThese little beings share with other Cephalopods the strange faculty of\r\nchanging colour under the influence of some vivid impression; but their\r\ngraceful and delicate organization redeems them from the charge we have\r\nbrought against the cuttles. The Nautilus can blush, turn pale, and show\r\nthrough its transparent shell its body changing in sudden shades; but it\r\nnever exhibits those bristling, unpleasant tubercles, the hideous\r\ninheritance of the larger and coarser Cephalopods--the tyrants of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe male Argonauts are very small, often not a tenth part of the size of\r\nthe females, which alone possess the shells.\r\n\r\nThe Nautilus carries its egg in the shell, and the little ones are also\r\nhatched in this floating cradle. Four species are at present known: the\r\nspecies described by Aristotle and Pliny, and the more ancient\r\nnaturalists; namely, _A. argo_, or _papyracea_ (Figs. 327 and 329),\r\nwhich are inhabitants of the Mediterranean as well as the Indian Ocean\r\nand the Antilles. Two others, _A. tubercula_, belonging exclusively to\r\nthe Indian Ocean, and _A. baillant_, which is met occasionally in the\r\nPacific and Atlantic Oceans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe nautilus belongs to the section of Octopoda, and the class of\r\nAcetabuliferous Cephalopods, having, as the name indicates, eight feet,\r\nfrom ὀκτὼ, _eight_, and ποῦς, _foot_; at the same time the body\r\nis entirely fleshy, and without fins. The genera of cuttles (_Sepia_)\r\nand Calmars (_Loligo_) belong to another section of the same class;\r\nnamely, the Decapoda, because they have ten feet and a sort of internal\r\nosselet, with fins, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MOLLUSCA.\r\n\r\nWe have thought it better to treat this subject in a separate chapter,\r\nfor its vast and complicated nature renders it otherwise difficult to\r\nhandle, except in a space which would exceed the limits of this work.\r\n\r\nThe different genera of the organic world are peculiar to, or most\r\nfrequent in, certain localities, and even species and varieties have\r\ntheir limits. This habit pervades the entire range of organisms, from\r\nthe lowest plants to man, whose qualities are to a great extent the type\r\nof the locality he inhabits. The geography of the Mollusca is perhaps\r\nthe best known to science. The labours of Mr. Louis Agassiz, Dr.\r\nSclater, and Professor Edward Forbes, have done much towards giving us a\r\nclear idea of zoological geography. Climate alone is insufficient to\r\naccount for the distribution of animals: some higher cause rules here.\r\nBut while we admit this, still we must acknowledge that climate exerts\r\nconsiderable influence in modifying the qualities of species.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the Mollusca may be considered from three points of\r\nview. First, as regards _geography_; second as regards _depth_; and\r\nthird as regards _time_; the last belongs to geology.\r\n\r\nWe shall now survey the principal divisions of the ocean; the line of\r\ndemarcation being drawn, not by latitude or longitude, but by genera and\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca of the Arctic seas are well known to show considerable\r\nanalogy with those of the later Tertiary periods of Europe. Hence the\r\ngreat interest connected with their comparison, as it affords,--provided\r\nwe are satisfied with this line of argument,--a proof that an Arctic\r\nclimate formerly existed in temperate regions. It is the northern Drift\r\nof which we are speaking. Even when species are found living in Britain\r\nidentical with those of the Arctic regions, still there is often a\r\ndifference in the form or size of British and Arctic specimens; certain\r\nspecies, such as _Cyprina Islandica_, being comparatively small in the\r\nsouth of Britain, larger in Shetland, and attaining their greatest size\r\nin Iceland.\r\n\r\nThe countries included in the Arctic molluscan province are Lapland,\r\nIceland, Greenland, the west coast of Davis' Straits, and Behring's\r\nStraits. About two hundred species are enumerated by the various Arctic\r\nvoyagers, as found in these seas; of these about one-half are peculiar\r\nto these seas, and the other half are either found living in the\r\ntemperate regions of Europe, or in their so-called glacial strata.\r\n\r\nThe Boreal province includes the North Atlantic, from Nova Scotia to\r\nIceland, and from thence to Faroe, Shetland, and the Norway coast.\r\n\r\nThe number of species is very large; and more than one-half are common\r\nboth to Scandinavia and the North American coast, while a great number\r\nalso are found on the British coast.\r\n\r\nThe province called Celtic by Professor Edward Forbes embraces the\r\ncoasts of Britain, Sweden, and Denmark.\r\n\r\nOur British mollusca are about seven hundred in number; those bearing\r\nshells are above five hundred. Of these about thirty are peculiar to\r\nBritain. The shells of the Baltic are identical with those of this\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThe Lusitanian province stretches from Madeira and the Canaries to the\r\ncoasts of Spain and Portugal, and includes also the Mediterranean. But\r\nas one might expect, on close examination, the Mollusca in so large an\r\narea differ so widely that we are forced to admit the existence of great\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nThe number of species found on the coast of Madeira by Mr. McAndrew was\r\none hundred and fifty-six, of which forty-four per cent. were identical\r\nwith British species, and eighty-three found near the Canaries.\r\n\r\nThe shells of the Mediterranean are six hundred in number, but it is\r\nprobable that more extensive dredging will result in great accessions\r\nbeing made to this list. A very small number of species only are\r\nidentical with those now found in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nNine genera are peculiar to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nIn the character of its shells, the Black Sea resembles the\r\nMediterranean, but does not contain much more than a tenth of the number\r\nof its species. The number of shells found on the Spanish and Portuguese\r\ncoasts is much smaller than one would expect, and can only be attributed\r\nto the scanty explorations that have been made. As we might expect, the\r\nnumber of species identical with those of Northern Europe is much\r\ngreater on the Atlantic than on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe sea of Aral, and the Caspian, contain a few peculiar species; but\r\nthey have been so little explored, that it is premature, we think, to\r\nform them into a province. The proportions of salt contained in these\r\nseas is much less than in the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe west of Africa affords a considerable number of fine shells; the\r\nspecies most numerous being those of Murex, Conus, and Clavatula.\r\n\r\nThe south African province contains four hundred species; the\r\ncharacteristic genera are Terebratella, Chiton, Patella, Trochus,\r\nFissurella, Cypræa, and Conus. A large number of these species are not\r\nfound elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Indo-Pacific province stretches from Australia to Japan; the\r\ngreater part of the east coast of Africa; the Red Sea; Persian Gulf; the\r\nAsiatic coast, and the islands of the Indian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe molluscs of the Red Sea remind us of those of India; the percentage\r\nof those found also in the Mediterranean being much less. The shells of\r\nthe Persian Gulf are but little known; one species, the brindled cowry\r\n(_Cypræa princeps_), has been sold for fifty pounds.\r\n\r\nThe seas of New Zealand and Australia have been formed into a province.\r\nAs might be anticipated, their mollusca have little in common with those\r\nof the rest of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe Japonic province includes the coast of Japan and the Corea.\r\n\r\nThe Aleutian province, the centre of which may be taken to be the\r\nAleutian islands, shows great analogy with the Boreal province of the\r\nwest, a considerable number of the shells being identical--a fact\r\nespecially interesting when we consider that very few species are found\r\ncommon to both the south-eastern and south-western coasts of America.\r\n\r\nThe Californian province is very distinct from that of Panama; the most\r\nnumerous genera found there, are Chiton, Acmæa, Fissurella, Trochus, and\r\nPurpura.\r\n\r\nThe marine shells of Panama are upwards of thirteen hundred; the region\r\nincluded stretches from the Gulf of California to Peru. For our\r\nknowledge of this province we are much indebted to the researches of Dr.\r\nP. P. Carpenter, who has catalogued six hundred and fifty-four species,\r\nas found at Mazattan.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvian province contains a long list of species, and extends from\r\nCallao to Valparaiso.\r\n\r\nThe Magellanic province includes the extreme south of America and the\r\nFalkland Islands. Many genera, the species of which are usually small,\r\nhere reach an enormous size, and afford, in many cases, the chief animal\r\nfood consumed by the quadrupeds and human population of that wild and\r\ndesolate coast.\r\n\r\nThe Patagonian province extends from St. Catharina to Point Melo on the\r\neast coast.\r\n\r\nThe number of species found also in the Falkland Islands is very small;\r\nbut a large number are identical with Brazilian species; yet the\r\nmajority are peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe Caribbean province extends from Brazil to the West Indies, and\r\nincludes, also, the northern coast of South America and the Gulf of\r\nMexico; a total of fifteen hundred species is enumerated by Professor\r\nAdams as belonging to the province.\r\n\r\nThe Transatlantic province, or that on the coast of the United States,\r\ndoes not afford a large number of species, only two hundred and thirty\r\nbeing known; of these, only fifteen are found in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe study of the terrestrial and fresh-water mollusca affords even\r\nbetter grounds for their division into provinces; but we shall not enter\r\ninto it here, as it belongs to the Land World.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall now say a few words on the depth of the sea, or ocean, in which\r\nMollusca are found.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Milne Edwards, Audonin, and Professor Edward Forbes,\r\nhave led to the division of the sea into four zones.\r\n\r\nThe deep sea Coral zone, from fifty to one hundred fathoms; the\r\nCoralline zone from fifteen to fifty fathoms; the Laminarian zone, which\r\nstretches from fifteen fathoms to low water; and the Littoral zone,\r\nbetween high and low water marks. The great stronghold of Crania,\r\nThetis, Neæra, Yoldia, Dentalium, and Scissurella, is in the deep sea\r\nCoral zone; while Buccinum, Fusus, Pleurotoma, Natica, Aporrhais,\r\nPhiline, and Velutina, which are among the most ravenous and predatory\r\nof molluscs, are found in the Coralline zone. They attack the bivalves,\r\nwhose shells among the relics of former seas, as in those of the\r\npresent, show evidence of an assault and a murder.\r\n\r\nThe principal genera of the Laminarian zone are the Nudibranchiata,\r\nAplysia, Trochus, Nacella, Rissoa, and Lacuna, which feed so much on the\r\nseaweed of this region.\r\n\r\nThe Littoral zone, which being accessible as the tide recedes, is best\r\nknown, affords Cardium, Mytilus, Tellina, Solen, Trochus, Patella,\r\nLittorina, and Purpura; or in plain English, cockles, mussels,\r\nrazor-fish, limpets, periwinkles and tingles;--species which are the\r\nfirst to attract our attention, and which are so much used for food.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Is it necessary to say that even this account--apparently\r\nso well authenticated, not to speak of the representation drawn on the\r\nspot--should be taken \"cum grano salis?\"--ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE CRUSTACEA.\r\n\r\n    \"Multa tamen lætus tristia pontus habet.\"\r\n\r\n    OVID.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe animals of this class, as regards organisation, must be placed\r\nhigher in the scale than the Arachnidæ, or spiders; but they are beneath\r\nthe Mollusca, although as regards affinity, the Mollusca in their lower\r\ndivision--the Molluscoïda--more approximate to the Polyp class than to\r\nthe Crustacea.\r\n\r\nThe Crustacea is the highest division of articulate animals with feet;\r\nthey breathe by means of gills, and have no stigmata, or air-passages,\r\nas in insects. The name signifies a hard crust or covering, with which\r\nthe animals are protected. This consists of layers of carbonate of lime\r\nwith one of pigment, generally, but not always, on the surface. The\r\ngeneral outline of these animals is peculiar; unlike insects, they are\r\nnot divisible into head, thorax, and abdomen; many species truly have no\r\nhead at all; but a pair of eyes point to the seat of intelligence. Most\r\nof these animals have two compound eyes; but a few, like some insects,\r\nhave both simple and compound eyes. The mouth is situated in the under\r\npart of the anterior of the body: in some cases they have jaws, as in\r\ncrabs; in others suckers only.\r\n\r\nPassing over the vast numbers of beings which inhabit the debatable\r\nground--the _Annelids_, which were for ages confounded with the worms,\r\nbecause of their resemblance in form:--a form which might be declared\r\nforbidding, but, as Aristotle has well said, Nature, in her domain,\r\nknows nothing low, nothing contemptible; the sea-leeches, whose\r\ncondition was an impenetrable mystery to Pliny, \"Omnia incerta ratione,\r\net in naturæ majestate abdita;\" and the singular cirripedes, one species\r\nof which, the barnacle (_Anatifa lævis_), was thought by old Gerard,\r\nthe herbalist, and in his day by many others, to be the egg from which\r\nthe barnacle goose was produced--passing over these ocean tribes, we\r\nreach the Crustaceans--the Insects of the Sea; of greater size, force,\r\nand voracity than any land insect with which we are acquainted. They are\r\narmed, also, at all points; for, in place of the coriaceous tunic, they\r\nare clothed in calcareous armour, both hard and strong, and bristling\r\nwith coarse hairs, spiny tubercles, and even serrated spines.\r\n\r\nThe Crustaceans have nearly all of them claws, formidably hooked and\r\ntoothed, which they employ as pincers, both in offensive and defensive\r\nwar. They have been compared to the heavily-armed knights of the middle\r\nages--at once audacious and cruel; barbed in steel from head to foot,\r\nwith visor and corslet, arm-pieces and thigh-pieces--nothing, in fact,\r\nis wanting to complete the resemblance.\r\n\r\nThese marine marauders live on the sea-coast, among the rocks, and near\r\nthe shore. Some few of them frequent the deep waters, others hide\r\nthemselves in the sand or under stones, while the common crab (_Carcinus\r\nmœnas_, Leach) loves the shore almost as much as the salt water, and\r\nestablishes itself accordingly under some moist cliff overhanging the\r\nsea, where it can enjoy both.\r\n\r\nOne of the necessary consequences of the condition of these animals,\r\nenclosed in a hard shell, is their power of throwing it off. The\r\nsolidity of their calcareous carapace would effectually prevent their\r\ngrowth, but at certain determinate periods Nature despoils the warrior\r\nof his cuirass; the creature moults, and the calcareous crust falls off,\r\nand leaves it with a thin, pale, and delicate tunic. In this state the\r\nCrustacean is no longer worthy of its name--its skin has become as\r\nvulnerable as that of the softest mollusc; but it has the instinct of\r\nweakness--it retires into lonely places, and hides its shame in some\r\nobscure crevice, until another vestment, more suitable for resistance,\r\nand adapted to its increased size, has been restored.\r\n\r\nThe Crustacean has not a vertebral column. The covering of the\r\nCrustacean consists of a great number of distinct pieces, connected\r\ntogether by means of portions of the epidermis which have not yet become\r\nhardened, in the same way as the bones in the skeleton of the vertebrata\r\nare connected by cartilages, the ossification of which only takes place\r\nin old age. The covering of the Crustacean consists of a series of rings\r\nvarying in number, the normal number of the body-segments being\r\ntwenty-one. Each ring is divisible into two arcs--one upper, or dorsal,\r\nthe other lower, or ventral; and each arc may present four elementary\r\npieces, two of which are united in the mesial line from the _tergum_, or\r\nback; the lower arc is a counterpart of this, while the others form the\r\ntwo side, or epimeral, pieces. The skin, therefore, performs the\r\nfunctions of a skeleton, so that the Crustaceans, as was said by\r\nGeoffroy Saint Hilaire, like the molluscs, live inside and not outside\r\nthe bony column. The analogue of the Crustacea amongst vertebrata is to\r\nbe found amongst Sturgeonidæ, whose hard, immovable bony case encloses a\r\nsofter skeleton; agreeing in its characters with that of the higher\r\ndivisions of vertebrata, although not possessing the solidity of bone.\r\n\r\nThe Crustaceans vary greatly in colour; some are of a dark, iron-grey,\r\nwith a dash of steel-blue, like metal weapons forged for combat; a few\r\nof them are red, or reddish-brown; others are of an earthy yellow, or of\r\na livid blue.\r\n\r\n\"The integument,\" according to Milne Edwards, \"consists of a _corium_,\r\nor true skin, and epidermis, with a pigmentary matter, which colours the\r\nlatter. The corium is a thick, spongy, and vascular membrane, connected\r\nwith the serous substance which lines the parietal walls of the\r\ncavities, as the serous membrane lines the internal cavities among the\r\nvertebrata.\" This pigment is less a membrane than an amorphous matter\r\ndiffused through the outer layer of the superficial membrane, which\r\nchanges to red in the greater number of species in alcohol, ether,\r\nacids, and water at 212° Fahr.\r\n\r\nThe calcareous crust of the animal is thick, and in the dorsal region\r\ncapable of great resistance; their members are also of remarkable\r\nhardness; but in the smaller species the shell is often thin, and of\r\nthat crystalline transparency which permits of its digestion and\r\ncirculation being observed. Many species, which are quite microscopic,\r\ncontribute colour to the sea--red, purple, or scarlet: such are\r\n_Grimothea D'Urvillei_ and _G. gregarea_.\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1823, it was not generally supposed that this class of\r\nanimals was subject to change of shape from the larva condition, and\r\nduring its progressive development; but about this time, and for some\r\nyears following, certain able microscopic experiments clearly\r\ndemonstrated that a minute nondescript kind of animal called the _Zoea\r\nTaurus_, was nothing more nor less than the young of a kind of Prawn as\r\nwhen extracted from the egg. Mr. Vaughan Thomson, by many successive\r\nobservations, and under the fire of much adverse criticism,\r\nsatisfactorily established the truth of metamorphic change in many\r\ngenera, and, in particular, in regard to the common crab (_Cancer\r\npagurus_); having succeeded in hatching the ova of this species, the\r\nproduct of which were fine Zoeas. That there are variations in the\r\nchannel of this law of change has been admitted, but that generally a\r\nmetamorphosis exists, analogous to that of insects, in the various\r\ngenera of Crustacea, with hardly an exception, has been clearly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 331. Zoea Taurus.]\r\n\r\nThe recorded observations of the eminent naturalist we have mentioned,\r\nMr. Thomson, as well as those of Mr. Couch, of Penzance, Mr. Milne\r\nEdwards, and particularly those of the last mentioned, the learned\r\nauthor of perhaps the best work extant on the Crustacea, are referred to\r\nas treating most lucidly on this interesting subject.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of this metamorphosis, we give figures of the _Zoea\r\nTaurus_ in two states, viz., Fig. _a_, in the first stage; and second,\r\nFig. _b_, as the animal appeared on the fourth day after the first\r\nmicroscopic examination, and when it resolved itself into a kind of\r\nprawn. The drawings appear in Mr. Bell's \"History of British Stalk-eyed\r\nCrustacea,\" and were taken by that gentleman from the work of a Dutch\r\nnaturalist, named Slabber, who made the original observation in the year\r\n1768, and published the result in 1778, from which time the subject had\r\nbeen allowed to fall asleep until revived by Mr. Thomson.\r\n\r\nAmong the sea-spiders, which have no neck (_Cephalothorax_), the head\r\ngradually disappears in the breast, but the belly remains distinct; the\r\nmiddle of the body is compressed, the shape narrow and graceful. Among\r\nthe Crustaceans which have neither neck nor shape, the head, the breast,\r\nand the belly form only one mass, often short, squat, athletic, and\r\ndifficult to take, as in _Pisa tetraodon_ (Fig. 332), the four-horned\r\nspider-crab.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 332. Pisa tetraodon.]\r\n\r\nMany of these animals have a powerful tail, consisting of a certain\r\nnumber of ciliated paddles, which it uses in swimming to beat the water,\r\nand to confuse its enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Crustaceans, so far as they are aquatic, respire by means of\r\n_branchiæ_, or gills. In the larger species these branchiæ are\r\nlamellous, or with filaments, whose supports are traversed by two\r\ncanals, one of which leads the blood into the general economy, the other\r\ndirects it towards the heart. These organs are enclosed in the body. In\r\nthe smaller species the branchiæ often appear exteriorly, hanging in the\r\nwater like a fungus. Sometimes these are at once swimming and breathing\r\norgans; in other cases the animal has no special organs of respiration.\r\n\r\nNearly all the Crustaceans are strong, hardy, and destructive, forming a\r\nhorde of nocturnal brigands--merciless marauders, who recoil from no\r\ntrap in which they can lie in wait for their prey. They fight _à\r\nl'outrance_ not only with their enemies, but often among themselves,\r\neither for a prey or for a female, sometimes for the sake of the fight.\r\nThe miserable creatures struggle audaciously with their claws. The\r\ncarapace generally resists the most formidable blows; but the feet, the\r\ntail, and, above all, the antennæ, suffer frightful mutilation. Happily\r\nfor the vanquished, the mutilated members sprout again after a few weeks\r\nof repose. This is the reason for the many Crustaceans met with having\r\nthe talons of very unequal size: the smaller are those lost in battle\r\nreplaced. Nature has willed that the Crustacean should not long remain\r\nan invalid. They soon return cured of their wounds. \"We have seen\r\nlobsters,\" says Moquin-Tandon, \"which have in an unfortunate rencounter\r\nlost a limb, sick and debilitated, reappear at the end of a few months\r\nwith a perfect limb, vigorous, and ready for service. O Nature, how thou\r\nfillest our souls with astonishment and wonder!\"\r\n\r\nOn the Spanish coast there is a species of crab, known, singularly\r\nenough, by the name of _Boccaccio_; it is caught for its claw, which is\r\nconsidered excellent eating. This is cut off, and the mutilated animal\r\nis thrown into the sea, to be taken at some future time when the claw\r\nhas reappeared.\r\n\r\nCrustaceans are nearly all carnivorous, and eat eagerly all other\r\nanimals, whether living or dead, fresh or decomposed. Little think they\r\nof the quality or condition of their food. It is amusing to witness the\r\naddress and gravity with which the common crab, when it has seized an\r\nunfortunate mussel, holds the valve open with one claw, while with the\r\nother it rapidly detaches the animal, carrying each morsel to the mouth,\r\nas one might do with the hand, until the shell is entirely empty. The\r\ncrab does not kill its prey directly, like the lobster; it is swallowed\r\nalso, but with greater appreciation.\r\n\r\nM. Charles Lespés surprised upon the shore at Royan a shoal of crabs at\r\ntheir repast. This day they seem to have dined in common, and \"God knows\r\nthe enjoyment,\" as the good Fontaines said. They were in rows, every\r\nhead turned to the same side, and nearly on end on their eight feet.\r\nThey seized the small objects on the shore, which were carried to the\r\nmouth, each hand in its turn in regular order: when the right hand\r\nreached the mouth the left was on the ground. Let us just figure to\r\noneself a company of disciplined soldiers messing together at the same\r\ntable!\r\n\r\nThe Long-horned Corophius (_Corophium longicorne_), remarkable for its\r\nlong antennæ, knows perfectly well how to cut the byssus by which the\r\nmussels suspend themselves, in order that the bivalve may fall on the\r\nweeds among them. Other Crustaceans, also great oyster-eaters, have the\r\ncunning or instinct to attack the mollusc without exposing themselves to\r\ndanger. When the bivalve half opens its shell to enjoy the rays of the\r\nsun or take food, the evil-disposed Crustacean slips a stone between the\r\nvalve. This done, it devours the poor inhabitant of the shell at its\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nThe Corophius, respecting whom this question is hazarded, are extremely\r\nnumerous on the shores of the Atlantic towards the end of summer and\r\nautumn. They make constant war upon certain marine worms. Off the coast\r\nof La Rochelle they may be seen in myriads beating the muddy bottom with\r\ntheir long antennæ in search of their prey. Sometimes they meet one of\r\nthese Nereida or Arenicola many times their own size, when they unite in\r\na body to attack it. In the oyster beds of La Rochelle they are useful\r\nfriends to the oyster by destroying these enemies, although they do not\r\nhesitate to attack the mollusc when it comes in their way. During the\r\nwinter the mud of the bouchots gets piled up in unequal heaps, and when\r\nthe warm season returns, it has become hard and unfit for the\r\ncultivation of the mollusc. It is necessary to level and dry these\r\nmud-heaps--a process which would be both difficult and costly. Well, the\r\nCorophia charge themselves with the task. They plough up annually many\r\nsquare leagues covered with these heaps. They dilute the mud, which is\r\ncarried out by the ebbing tide, and the surface of the bay is left\r\nsmooth, as it was in the preceding autumn.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the Crustaceans do not even respect each other; the\r\nlarger of the same species often devour the smaller. _Rara concordia\r\nfratrum!_ Mr. Rymer Jones relates that he had on one occasion introduced\r\nsix crabs (_Platycarcinus pagurus_) of different size into an aquarium.\r\nOne of them, venturing towards the middle of the reservoir, was\r\nimmediately accosted by another a little larger, which took it with its\r\nclaws as it might have taken a biscuit, and set about breaking its\r\nshell, and so found a way to its flesh. It dug its crooked claws into it\r\nwith voluptuous enjoyment, appearing to pay no attention to the anger\r\nand jealousy of another of its companions, which was still stronger and\r\nas cruel, and advanced towards them. But, as Horace says--and he was not\r\nthe first to say it--\"No one is altogether happy in this lower world\":\r\n\r\n    \"Nihil est ab omni parte beatum.\"\r\n\r\nOur ferocious Crustacean quietly continued its repast, when its\r\ncompanion seized it exactly as it had seized its prey, broke and tore it\r\nin the same fashion, penetrating to its middle, and tearing out its\r\nentrails in the same savage manner. In the mean time the victim,\r\nsingularly enough, did not disturb itself for an instant, but continued\r\nto eat the first crab bit by bit, until it was itself entirely torn to\r\npieces by its own executioner--a remarkable instance at once of\r\ninsensibility to pain and of cruel infliction under the _lex talionis_.\r\nTo eat and to be eaten seems to be one of the great laws of Nature.\r\n\r\nThough essentially carnivorous, the Crustaceans sometimes eat marine\r\nvegetables. Many even seem to prefer fruit to animal food. Such is the\r\nrobber-crab (_Birgus latro_) of the Polynesian Isles, which feeds almost\r\nexclusively on the cocoa-nut. This crab has thick and strong claws; the\r\nothers are comparatively slender and weak. At first glance it seems\r\nimpossible that it could penetrate a thick cocoa-nut surrounded by a\r\nthick bed of fibre and protected by its strong shell; but M. Liesk has\r\noften seen the operation. The crab begins by tearing off the fibre at\r\nthe extremity where the fruit is, always choosing the right end. When\r\nthis is removed, it strikes it with its great claws until it has made an\r\nopening; then, by the aid of its slender claws, and by turning itself\r\nround, it extracts the whole substance of the nut.\r\n\r\nThe Crustaceans have eyes of two kinds--simple and compound: the first\r\nare sessile and immovable, and very convex; the other borne on a short\r\ncalcareous stem or peduncle, and formed of a number of small eyes\r\nsymmetrically agglomerated--the reunion of all the microscopic cornea of\r\na composite eye, resembling in shape a cap formed of facets. It is said,\r\nfor instance, that the eye of the lobster consists of 2500 of these\r\nlittle facets. The simple eyes are _myopus_, or short-sighted--the\r\ncompound eyes for more distant but perfect sight. They appear to have a\r\nstrong sense of smell. Many of them cannot swim, but walk with more or\r\nless facility at the bottom of the water. It is said, for instance, that\r\nthe cavalier of the Syrian coast, _Oxypoda cursor_ (Fabricius), is named\r\nfrom the rapidity with which it traverses great distances.\r\n\r\nMany systems have been proposed by different writers for the arrangement\r\nof the Crustacea. That proposed by Mr. Milne Edwards recommends itself,\r\nbeing founded on anatomical examination and actual experiment made by\r\nhimself and M. Audouin. He divides them into two great divisions: I.\r\nThose in which the mouth is furnished with a certain number of organs\r\nadapted for the prehension or division of food. II. Those in which the\r\nmouth is surrounded by ambulatory extremities, the bases of which\r\nperform the part of jaws. The first includes the MAXILOSA or\r\nMANDIBULATA, again divided into _Decapoda_, having branchiæ attached to\r\nthe sides of the thorax, and enclosed in special cavities. The\r\n_Decapoda_ are divided into: 1. BRACHYURA, namely, the Crabs. _Cancer_,\r\n_Porlunus_, _Grapsus_, _Ocypode_, and _Doippe_, belong to this group. 2.\r\nANOMOURA, including _Droma_, _Pagurus_, _Porcellana_, and _Hippa_. 3.\r\nMACROURA, including the Lobsters, _Astacus_, _Palæmon_, the Craw-fish,\r\n_Palinurus_.\r\n\r\n_Stomatopoda_, with external branchiæ, sometimes rudimentary, sometimes\r\nnone. Thoracic extremities prehensile, or for swimming generally, six or\r\neight pairs. This division includes Mysids, Phyllosoma, Squilla, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Cirripedia, or barnacles, are a very important division of\r\nCrustacea; they are found in all seas, and attach themselves to almost\r\nevery object in the sea; from the immovable rock to the moving animal;\r\nfrom the little Tunicata to the great turtle, or the whale.\r\n\r\nThe goose barnacles, _Anatifa_, have a flexible peduncle. The\r\nBalanoidea, or sea acorns, like oysters, are rooted to the spot on which\r\nthey rest in their infant days; without the power, like the goose\r\nbarnacle, of swaying to and fro like a pendulum, be their resting-place\r\nwhat it may.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable animals of this class of Crustacea is the\r\n_Limulus Moluccanus_--the Molucca crab. They are distinguished by a long\r\nserrated spine, which looks most formidable. They are in great request\r\nin the markets of Java. Linnæus thought that the fossil trilobites were\r\nclosely allied to the _Limulus_. Latreille, on the contrary, classed\r\nthem near the mollusc, chiton. The tail of _Limulus_ so strikingly\r\nresembles that of many Trilobites, that the most common observers may\r\nperceive an affinity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRABS AND CRAW-FISH.\r\n\r\nCrabs and lobsters may be regarded as the chiefs or lords of the\r\nCrustacean tribes. The crabs have very large claws and smooth backs; the\r\nlast have small claws and the back covered with spines. Tiberius Cæsar\r\nhad the face of a poor fisherman scratched by the rugged shell of a\r\ncraw-fish.\r\n\r\nLobsters, especially, have an amazing fecundity, and yield an immense\r\nnumber of eggs, each female producing from 12,000 to 20,000 in the\r\nseason. The crab is also very prolific. These eggs are, in the lobster,\r\narranged in packets, which are attached to the lower surface of the\r\ntail, to which they are connected by a viscous substance. The manner in\r\nwhich the female lobster disposes of her burden is curious and\r\ninteresting. Whether she bends or stands erect she is able to hold it\r\nobscurely or expose it to the light. Sometimes, according to Coste, the\r\neggs are left immovable, or simply submerged; at others they are\r\nsubjected to successive washings by gently agitating the false claw\r\nwhich shelters them from right to left. When first exuded from the ovary\r\nthe eggs are very small, but they seem to increase during the time they\r\nare borne about under the tail, and before they are committed to the\r\nsand or water they have attained the size of small shot. The evolution\r\nof the germ is in progress during six months. At the moment of exclusion\r\nthe female extends the tail, impresses upon the eggs an oscillating\r\nmotion, in order to destroy the shell and scatter the larvæ, delivering\r\nherself in two or three days of her entire burden (Coste). \"As the young\r\nlie enclosed within the membrane of the egg,\" says Couch, \"the claws are\r\nfolded on each other, and the tail is flexed on them as far as the\r\nmargin of the shield. The dorsal spine is bent backwards, and lies in\r\ncontact with the dorsal shield, for the young when it escapes from the\r\negg is quite soft; but it rapidly hardens and solidifies by the\r\ndeposition of calcareous matter on what may be called its skin.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 333. Palinurus vulgaris. _a_, left outward\r\njaw-foot.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as born, the young Crustaceans withdraw from the mother and\r\nascend to the surface of the water, in order to gain the open sea. They\r\nswim in a circle; but this pelagic life is not of long duration; they\r\nquit it after their fourth moult, which takes place between the\r\nthirtieth and fortieth day, at which time they lose the transitory\r\norgans of natation which they have hitherto possessed. After this they\r\nare no longer able to maintain themselves on the surface, but drop to\r\nthe bottom. Henceforth they are condemned to remain there, and such\r\nwalking as they can exercise becomes their habitual mode of\r\nprogression. As they increase in size they gradually approach the\r\nshore, which they had for the moment abandoned, and return to the places\r\ninhabited by the parent Crustaceans.\r\n\r\nThe form of the larvæ differs so much from that of the adult, that it\r\nwould be difficult, except on the clearest evidence, to determine the\r\nspecies from which they proceed. Former naturalists considered the\r\nembryo cray-fish (_Palinurus_) to belong to a distinct genera, which\r\nthey designated _Phyllosoma_. It is now known, however, that these are\r\nthe young of the higher forms of Crustaceans undergoing metamorphosis.\r\nIn the various forms of _Macroura_ the metamorphosis is less decided\r\nthan in the _Brachyura_. In the fresh-water cray-fish no change whatever\r\ntakes place. Dissatisfied with the uncertainty of former experiments,\r\nMr. Couch undertook a series of observations, which are recorded in the\r\nproceedings of the Cornwall Polytechnic Society, in which he established\r\nthe fact that metamorphosis takes place in the following genera: Cancer,\r\nXanthò, Plumnus, Carcinus, Portunus, Maja, Galathea, Hornarus, and\r\nPalinurus. \"Metamorphosis has been demonstrated,\" says Dr. Bell, \"in no\r\nless than seventeen genera of the Brachyurous order of Decapoda, in\r\nwhich it is most decided and obvious; in Leptopodia, Majacea, Cancer,\r\nPortunidæ, Pinnoteres, and Grapsus. In the Anomourous order it is seen\r\nin the Pagurus, Porcellana, and Galathea; and in the Macrouran order in\r\nHomarus, Palinurus, Palæmon, and Crangon.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 334. Portunus variegatus, male.\r\n\r\n_a_, external antenna; _b_, external jaw-foot; _c_, tail or abdomen.]\r\n\r\nThe swimming of these creatures is produced by flexions and expansions\r\nof the tail, and by repeated beating motions of the claws, the tail\r\nacting as a sort of vibratile oar, aided by which they maintain\r\nthemselves in the water and facilitate their progress. As the shell\r\nbecomes more solid they get less active, and finally return to the\r\nbottom to cast their shell and assume a new form.\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of M. Coste, the young lobster casts its\r\nshell from eight to ten times in the first year, from five to seven in\r\nthe second, three to four times the third, and two or three times the\r\nfourth year. In the fifth year they attain the adult state. Whence it\r\nfollows, that the small lobsters served at our tables have changed their\r\ncalcareous vestment something like twenty-one times, and are now clothed\r\nin their twenty-second habit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 335. Corystes Cassivelaunus, male.]\r\n\r\nThe crabs are numerous in species and various in size. The long-clawed\r\ncrab (_Corystes Cassivelaunus_) of Pennant and Leach (Fig. 335) is\r\nremarkable for its long antennæ, which considerably exceed the body. The\r\njaw-feet have their third joint longer than the second, terminating in\r\nan obtuse point, with a notch on its interior edge; eyes wide apart,\r\nborne upon large peduncles, which are nearly cylindrical and short;\r\nanterior feet large, equal, twice the length of the body, and nearly\r\ncylindrical in the males; in the females (Fig. 336) about the length of\r\nthe body, and compressed, especially towards the hand-claw. The other\r\nfeet terminate in an elongated nail or claw, which is straight-pointed\r\nand channeled longitudinally: carapace oblong-oval, terminating in a\r\nrostrum anteriorly truncated and bordered posteriorly; the regions but\r\nslightly indicated, with the exception of the cordian region, the\r\nbranchial or lateral regions being very much elongated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 336. Corystes Cassivelaunus, female.]\r\n\r\nLatreille gives the name of Corystes, which signifies a warrior armed,\r\nto this genus of Crustaceans, from κόρυς, a helmet, but it is\r\nperfectly inoffensive. Pennant had already conferred the name of\r\n_Cassivelaunus_, the chief of the Ancient Britons, for the singular\r\nreason, according to Gosse, that the carapace, which is marked by\r\nwrinkles, bears, in old males especially, the strongest and most\r\nludicrous resemblance to the face of an ancient man. Pennant's\r\nwell-known sympathy with his British ancestry certainly never led him\r\nto caricature the grand old British warrior, as Mr. Gosse surmises. On\r\nthe contrary, he saw in the Crustacean a creature armed at all points,\r\nand he named it after the hero of his imagination.\r\n\r\nIn this species the surface of the carapace is somewhat granulous, with\r\ntwo denticles between the eyes, and three sharp points directed forward\r\non each side. The male has only five abdominal pieces, but the vestiges\r\nof the separation of the two others may be clearly remarked upon the\r\nouter mediate or third piece, which is the largest of all. The length of\r\nthe antennæ is remarked on by Mr. Couch, in his Cornish Fauna. \"These\r\norgans,\" he says, \"are of some use beyond their common office of\r\nfeelers; perhaps, as in some other Crustaceans, they assist in the\r\nprocess of excavation; and, when soiled by labour, I have seen the crab\r\neffect their cleaning by alternately bending the joints of their stalks,\r\nwhich stand conveniently angular for the purpose. Each of the long\r\nantennæ is thus drawn along the brush that fringes the internal face of\r\nthe other, until both are cleared of every particle that adhered to\r\nthem.\" On the other hand, Mr. Gosse suggests that the office of the\r\nantennæ is to keep a passage open for ejecting the deteriorated water\r\nafter it has bathed and aerated the gills. \"I have observed,\" he says,\r\n\"that, when kept in an aquarium, these crabs are fond of sitting bolt\r\nupright, the antennæ placed close together, and pointing straight\r\nupwards from the head. This is doubtless the attitude in which the\r\nanimal sits in its burrow, for the tips of the antennæ may often be seen\r\njust projecting from the sand. When the chosen seat has happened to be\r\nso close to the glass side of the tank as to bring the antennæ within\r\nthe range of a pocket lens, I have minutely investigated these organs\r\nwithout disturbing the old warrior in his meditation. I saw on each\r\noccasion that a strong current of water was continuously pouring up from\r\nthe points of the antennæ. Tracing this to its origin, it became evident\r\nthat it was produced by the rapid vibration of the foot-jaws drawing in\r\nthe surrounding water, and pouring it off upwards _between the united\r\nantennæ_, as through a tube. Then, on examining these organs, I\r\nperceived that the form and arrangement of their bristles did indeed\r\nconstitute each antennæ a semi-tube, so that when the pair were brought\r\nface to face the tube was complete.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous genera of _Brachyurous Crustaceans_, Grapsus is\r\ndistinguished by its less regularly quadrilateral form; the body nearly\r\nalways compressed, and the sternal plastron but little or not at all\r\ncurved backwards; the front strongly recurved, or, rather, bent\r\ndownwards; the orbits oval-shaped and of moderate size; the lateral\r\nedges of the carapace slightly curving and trenchant; the ocular\r\npedicles large, but short: their insertion beneath the front and the\r\ncornea occupies one-half of their length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 337. Pagurus Bernhardus. 1, out of the shell; _a_,\r\nright jaw-foot; _b_, in the shell.]\r\n\r\nThe Hermit or Soldier Crab (_Pagurus Bernhardus_, Fabricius, Fig. 337)\r\nis, perhaps, the oddest and most curious of Crustaceans. It differs from\r\nmost other Crustaceans in this: in place of having the body protected by\r\na calcareous armour, more or less thick and solid, it has only a\r\ncuirass and head-piece to protect the head and breast; all the rest of\r\nthe body is invested in a soft yielding skin; and this, the vulnerable\r\npart of the hermit crab, is the delicate morsel devoured by the gourmet.\r\nNor is our somewhat evil-disposed Crustacean ignorant of the perfectly\r\nweak and defenceless state of its posterior quarters. Prudence or\r\ninstinct makes it seek the shelter of some empty shell, of a shape and\r\nsize corresponding to its own. When it fails to find one empty, it does\r\nnot hesitate to attack some living testacean, which it kills without\r\npity or remorse, and takes possession of its habitation without other\r\nform of process. Once master of the shell (Fig. 337), it introduces\r\nitself, stern foremost, and installs itself as in an entrenchment, where\r\nit is established so firmly that it moves about with it more or less\r\nbriskly, according to its comparative size.\r\n\r\nThe Pagurians belong to the Anomourous family of Crustaceans, of which\r\nthere are several genera, and a considerable number of species, the\r\nanimal economy of which has been ably commented upon by Mr. Broderip.\r\n\"Their backs,\" he says, \"are towards the arch of the turbinated shell\r\noccupied by them, and their well-armed nippers and first two pairs of\r\nsucceeding feet generally project beyond the mouth of it. The short feet\r\nrest upon the polished surface of the columella, and the outer surface\r\nof their termination, especially that of the first pair, is in some\r\nspecies most admirably rough-shod, to give 'the soldier' a firm footing\r\nwhen he makes his sortie, or to add to the resistance of the crustaceous\r\nholders at the end of his abdomen, or tail, when he is attacked, and\r\nwishes to withdraw into his castle. On passing the finger downwards over\r\nthe terminations of these feet, they feel smooth; but if the finger be\r\npassed upwards, the roughness is instantly perceived. The same sort of\r\nstructure (it is as rough as a file) is to be seen in the smaller caudal\r\nholders.\" In another species of Pagurus, from the Mauritius, which was\r\nnearly a foot in length, he found a great number of transverse rows,\r\narmed with acetabula, or suckers; these were visible without the aid of\r\na glass, which must very much assist the hold of the _Pagurus_.\r\n\r\nDuring the feeding and breeding-time, the hermit throws out his head and\r\nfeet, and especially his great claws, and feels his way with his two\r\nantennæ, which are long and slender. When he walks he hooks on with his\r\npincers to the nearest body, and draws his shell after him, as the snail\r\ndoes his. But the undefended parts of the body always remain under\r\ncover. At low water the hermits spread themselves over the rocky shore,\r\nand the spectator thinks he sees a great number of shells which move in\r\nall directions, with allurements different from that which belongs to\r\ntheir essentially slow and measured race. If they are touched they stop\r\nsuddenly, and it is soon discovered that their shell is the dwelling of\r\na crustacean, not a mollusc. The animal lives alone in its little\r\ncitadel, like the hermit in his cell or the sentinel in his box. Hence\r\nthe name of _hermit_ and _soldier_.\r\n\r\nWhen our crustacean outgrows its borrowed habitation, it sets out in\r\nsearch of another shell, a little larger, and better suited for its\r\nincreased size.\r\n\r\nThe hermit often avails itself, as we have said, of empty shells\r\nabandoned by their owners; when the tide retires these seldom fail them,\r\nand the hermit may be seen examining, turning, and returning, and even\r\ntrying its new domicile. It glides slowly along on its abdomen, which is\r\nlarge and somewhat distorted, sometimes in one shell, sometimes in\r\nanother, looking defiantly all round it, and returning very quickly to\r\nits ancient lodging if the new one does not turn out to be perfectly\r\ncomfortable, often trying a great number, as a man might try many new\r\nclothes before suiting himself. In its successive removals the little\r\nsybarite chooses a hermitage more and more spacious, according to its\r\ntaste or caprice in colour or architecture. The cunning little creature\r\nchooses its mansion, now grey or yellow, now red or brown, globular or\r\ncylindrical, in the form of a spiral or of a tun, toothed or crenulate,\r\nwith trenchant edge or pointed terminations; but, as a rule, our\r\ncrustacean Diogenes houses itself in spirals of considerable length, as\r\nin _Cerithium_, _Buccinum_, or _Murex_.\r\n\r\nThe hermit is very timid; at the least noise it shrinks into its shell\r\nand squats itself, without motion, drawing in its smaller claws and\r\nclosing the door with its larger ones, the latter being often covered\r\nwith hairs, tubercles, or with teeth. In short, our prudent cenobite\r\nclings so closely to the bottom of its retreat, that we might pull it to\r\npieces without getting it out entire; its tail is transformed into a\r\nsort of sucker, by the aid of which it attaches itself firmly to the\r\nwalls of its habitation. It is at once strong and voracious, eating with\r\nmuch relish the dead fishes and fragments of molluscs and annelids which\r\ncome in its way. Nor does it hesitate to attack and devour living\r\nanimals. When introduced into an aquarium, it has sometimes thrown it\r\ninto the utmost disorder by its insatiable rapacity. It has been\r\npossible sometimes to preserve harmony among many individuals inhabiting\r\nthe same reservoir; but this has been owing rather to the impossibility\r\nof their attacking each other, in consequence of cunningly-devised\r\nbarricades, than to their mildness of character or love of their\r\nneighbour. These animals, in short, are very quarrelsome. Two hermits\r\ncannot meet without showing hostility; each extends his long pincers,\r\nand seems to try to touch the other, much as a spider does when it seeks\r\nto seize a fly on its most vulnerable side; but each, finding the other\r\narmed in proof, and perfectly protected, though eager to fight, usually\r\nadopts the better part of valour, and prudently withdraws. They often\r\nhave true passages of arms, nevertheless, in which claws are spread out,\r\nand displayed in the most threatening manner; the two adversaries\r\ntumbling head over heels, and rolling one upon the other, but they get\r\nmore frightened than hurt. Nevertheless, Mr. Gosse once witnessed a\r\nstruggle which had a more tragic end. A hermit crab met a brother\r\nBernhard pleasantly lodged in a shell much more spacious than his own.\r\nHe seized it by the head with his powerful claws, tore it from its\r\nasylum with the speed of lightning, and took its place not less\r\npromptly, leaving the dispossessed unfortunate struggling on the sand in\r\nconvulsions of agony. \"Our battles,\" says Charles Bonnet, \"have rarely\r\nsuch important objects in view: they fight each other for a house.\"\r\n\r\nA pretty little zoophyte, the Cloak Anemone (_Adamsia palliata_), loves\r\nto live with the hermit, and exhibits sympathies almost inexplicable. In\r\naquariums this anemone attaches itself almost always to the shell which\r\nserves as the dwelling of the Crustacean; and it may be looked upon as\r\ncertain that where the hermit is there will the anemone be found. These\r\ntwo creatures seem to live in perfect and intelligent harmony together,\r\nfor Mr. Gosse's observations establish the existence of a cordial and\r\nreciprocal affection between them. This learned and intelligent observer\r\ndescribes the proceedings of a hermit which required a new habitation;\r\nhe saw it detach, in the most deliberate but effective manner, its dear\r\ncompanion, the anemone, from the old shell, transport it with every care\r\nand precaution, and place it comfortably upon the new shell, and then\r\nwith its large pincers give to its well-beloved many little taps, as if\r\nto fix it there the more quickly. Another species of Bernhardus makes a\r\ncompanion of the _mantled anemone_. \"And we are assured,\" says\r\nMoquin-Tandon, \"that when the crab dies its inconsolable friend is not\r\nlong in succumbing also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there not here much more than what our modern physiologists call\r\nautomatic movements, the results of reflex sensorial action?\" says\r\nGosse. \"The more I study the lower animals, the more firmly am I\r\npersuaded of the existence in them of psychical faculties, such as\r\nconsciousness, intelligence, skill, and choice; and _that_ even in those\r\nforms in which as yet no nervous centres have been detected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBSTERS.\r\n\r\nIn a dietary, as well as commercial sense, the lobster far excels the\r\ncrab; like the latter, they have an amazing fecundity, each female\r\nproducing from twelve to twenty thousand eggs in a season; and wisely is\r\nit so arranged, otherwise the consumption would soon exhaust them.\r\n\r\nIn France the size of the marketable lobster is regulated by law, and\r\nfixed at twenty centimètres (eight inches) in length; all under that\r\nsize are contraband. Every year the inhabitants of Blainville proceed to\r\nChaussey to fish for lobsters. They are taken in baskets in the form of\r\na truncated cone, the mouth of which is so arranged that the animal can\r\nenter, but cannot get out. The numbers caught by each fisherman and his\r\nfamily in a season may be estimated at a thousand or twelve hundred,\r\nwhich realise to the family thirteen or fourteen hundred francs, the\r\nseason lasting about nine months.\r\n\r\nLobsters are collected all round our own coast for the London market. On\r\nthe Scottish shore they are collected and kept in perforated chests\r\nfloating on the water, until they can be taken away to market. From the\r\nSutherland coast alone six to eight thousand lobsters are collected in a\r\nseason. This process goes on all round the coast, and as far as Norway,\r\nwhence an enormous supply of the finest lobsters are obtained, for which\r\nsomething like £20,000 per annum is paid, all these contributions being\r\nconveyed to the Thames and Mersey in welled vessels. But these\r\nold-fashioned systems are being rapidly superseded by the construction\r\nof artificial storing ponds, or basins. Of these ponds Mr. Richard\r\nScovell has erected one at Hamble, near Southampton, in which he can\r\nstore with ease fifty thousand lobsters, which will keep in good\r\ncondition for six weeks. Mr. Scovell's tank is supplied from the coasts\r\nof France, Scotland, and Ireland, where fine lobsters abound. He employs\r\nthree large and well-appointed smacks, each of which can carry from five\r\nthousand to ten thousand. On the coast of Ireland alone, it is said, ten\r\nthousand fine lobsters a week might be taken.\r\n\r\nThe Lobster (_Homarus_) is found in great abundance all round our coast;\r\nfrequenting the more rocky shores and clear water, where it is of no\r\ngreat depth, about the time of depositing its eggs. Various are the\r\nmodes in which they are taken; cone-shaped traps made of wicker-work,\r\nand baited with garbage, are perhaps the most successful. These are sunk\r\namong the rocks, and marked by buoys. Sometimes nets are sunk, baited by\r\nthe same material. In other places a wooden instrument, which acts like\r\na pair of tongs, is used for their capture.\r\n\r\nMr. Pennant, the naturalist, paid great attention to the lobsters, and\r\ntheir habits are well described in a letter from Mr. Travis, of\r\nScarborough. \"The larger ones,\" he says, \"are in their best season from\r\nthe middle of October to the beginning of May. Many of the smaller ones,\r\nand some few of the larger individuals, are good all the summer. If they\r\nare four and a half inches long from the top of the head to the end of\r\nthe back shell, they are called sizeable lobsters; if under four inches,\r\nthey are esteemed half size, and two of them are reckoned for one of\r\nsize. Under four inches they are called pawks, and these are the best\r\nsummer lobsters. The pincers of one of the lobster's large claws are\r\nfurnished with knobs, while the other claw is always serrated. With the\r\nformer it keeps firm hold of the stalks of submarine plants; with the\r\nlatter it cuts and masticates its food very dexterously. The knobbed or\r\nthumb claw, as the fishermen call it, is sometimes on the left,\r\nsometimes on the right side, and it is more dangerous to be seized by\r\nthe serrated claw than the other.\"\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the lobsters cast their shell annually, but\r\nthe mode in which it is performed is not satisfactorily explained. It is\r\nsupposed that the old shell is cast, and that the animal retires to some\r\nlurking-place till the new covering acquires consistence to contend with\r\nhis armour-clad congeners. Others contend that the process is one of\r\nabsorption, otherwise, if there were a period of moult, it would be\r\nshown by their shells. The most probable conjecture is that the shell\r\nsloughs off piecemeal, as it does in the cray-fish. The greatest mystery\r\nof all, perhaps, is the process by which the lobster withdraws the\r\nfleshy part of its claws from their calcareous covering. Fishermen say\r\nthe lobster pines before casting its shell, so as to permit of its\r\nwithdrawing its members from it.\r\n\r\nThe female lobster does not seem to cast her shell the same year in\r\nwhich she deposits her ova, or, as the fishermen say, \"is in berry.\"\r\nWhen the ova first appear under the tail, they are small and very black,\r\nbut before they are ready for deposition they are almost as large as\r\nripe elderberries, and of a dark-brown colour. There does not seem to be\r\nany particular season for this act, as females are found in berry at all\r\nseasons, but more commonly in winter. In this state they are found to be\r\nmuch exhausted, and by no means fit for the table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 338. Nephrops Norvegicus.]\r\n\r\nThe generic name, _Astacus_ of Fabricius, is now confined to the\r\ncrawfishes, which have a depressed rostrum, one tooth on each side, and\r\nthe last ring of the thorax movable. The lobsters (_Homarus_) have the\r\neyes spherical, two rings of the thorax being soldered together. The\r\nNorway Lobsters (_Nephrops Norvegicus_, Fig. 338) have the eyes uniform,\r\nand the two last rings of the thorax movable.\r\n\r\nThe last is one of the most beautiful of the larger Macrourans. Its\r\ngeneral tint is pale flesh colour, with darker shades in parts, its\r\npubescence light brown. This is generally considered a northern species,\r\nbut Mr. Bell states that he has received specimens from the\r\nMediterranean. It is found plentifully on the coast of Norway, on the\r\nScottish coast, and in the Bay of Dublin. It is considered the most\r\ndelicate of all the Crustaceans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 339. Crangon vulgaris, _a_, Anterior foot or claw.]\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter, we perhaps should not omit brief notices\r\nof the common prawn (_Palæmon serratus_) and the shrimp (_Crangon\r\nvulgaris_), as types of an extensive variety of form of crustacea, which\r\ninhabit all seas, and which perform important functions as regards the\r\nsanitary state and economic condition of the waters of the ocean. These\r\nsmall animals are the scavengers of the sea--they pick up and devour all\r\ndead matter, leaving (it may be) a clean skeleton, without a shred of\r\nfibre behind. In this respect they resemble the ants on land, doing\r\ntheir work always thoroughly and effectively. We need hardly mention,\r\nwhat is so well known to every reader, that prawns and shrimps are\r\namongst the most esteemed delicacies at our table, and as articles of\r\nfood occupy no mean place on the fish-stall. At Billingsgate alone, it\r\nis hardly credible the immense quantities which arrive and are daily\r\nconsumed in the Metropolis by all classes of the community. The shrimp,\r\nwhich although the smaller crustacean, is perhaps the finest flavoured\r\nof the two, is sold in much larger quantities than its more aristocratic\r\ncongener, the prawn. The fishery of these savoury comestibles gives\r\noccupation not only to regular able-bodied fishermen, who devote\r\nthemselves to this branch, but also to large numbers of women and\r\nchildren, who--with their baskets and small nets--may be seen plying\r\ntheir vocation in a multitude of well-known localities on our coasts,\r\nespecially on the southern and south-eastern shores. To the habitués of\r\nHastings, Southampton, Bognor, &c., there is not a more picturesque or\r\nfamiliar marine picture than to behold a troop of little shrimpers, in\r\ntheir grotesque and somewhat outré equipments, wading patiently knee\r\ndeep all in a row, as they push before them their pole nets.\r\n\r\nWithout giving a detailed technical and anatomical description, which\r\nour space will not permit of, we may observe that the common prawn\r\n(_Palæmon serratus_) is about four or five inches long, with a rounded\r\ncarapace, which is jointed and furnished at the head with numerous long\r\nantennæ, the eyes being large and round. The tail is broad and flat, the\r\ncaudal laminæ of which are furnished with long hairs on the terminal\r\nmargins. The animal is also furnished with several pairs of feet, very\r\nslender, and ordinarily bent within themselves.\r\n\r\nThe colour is light grey, spotted and lined with purplish shades. In the\r\nwater, however, prawns are almost transparent, from the nearly entire\r\nabsence of carbonate of lime in the carapace; they are thus very\r\nbeautiful objects in the marine aquarium, moving as they do like shadows\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\nWhen prawns are boiled, they become of a delicate pink colour, thus\r\nadding beauty to the dainty morceaux.\r\n\r\nLike most other kinds of crustacea, the prawn is much larger in tropical\r\nclimates. On the coast of South America, for instance, they attain a\r\nsize of nine or ten inches in length, three of them being considered\r\nquite sufficient for a meal.\r\n\r\nThe London market is chiefly supplied with prawns from the Isle of Wight\r\nand Hampshire coast.\r\n\r\nLike the prawn, the shrimp has many varieties. The common shrimp\r\n(_Crangon vulgaris_) is about two and a half inches long, from the eye\r\nto the extremity of the tail. It is also furnished with a rounded\r\narticulated carapace, with two antennæ. The eyes are prominent, marked,\r\nand near each other; the tail flat, laminated, and hirsute. The shrimp\r\nis not very unlike the prawn in general appearance, but is of a much\r\nless complex and finished structure.\r\n\r\nIn colour it is greyish brown, clotted all over with dark brown. In this\r\nspecies heat does not improve the colour.\r\n\r\nThis variety is one of the most abundant of all coast crustacea,\r\nswimming about and laying on the sands (which they closely resemble in\r\ncolour) in immense shoals. Sometimes they are also found in deep water,\r\nbut the margin of the sea is their favourite habitat. It may be added,\r\nthat large quantities of the smaller palæmonidæ are caught with and sold\r\nas shrimps. Shrimps are in spawn all the year through, and cast their\r\nshells during the three months of spring.\r\n\r\nThe _Entomostraca_ of Milne Edwards, or the _Lophyropoda_ of Latreille,\r\nhave no suctorial mouth or mandibles capable of mastication; their\r\nmaxillæ are lamellose, and they have never more than ten swimming feet,\r\nand have from one to two eyes on stalks, and live in fresh water. There\r\nare two principal genera; the _Copepoda_ of Edwards, and the\r\n_Ostracoda_. As a type of the first, we may mention _Cyclops vulgaris_\r\n(Leach), which, true to its name, has but one eye. But the genus\r\n_Pontia_ of the same family has two. As a type of the second order,\r\n_Ostracoda_, we will specify the numerous family of the _Cyprides_,\r\nwhose animals are enclosed in a bivalve shell, which causes their\r\nremains in Secondary strata to be classed with bivalve molluscs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nFISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the habits of the principal kinds of fishes, it is\r\ndesirable to glance at their organization, and upon the manner in which\r\nthey execute their physiological functions.\r\n\r\nFishes are intended to live always[14] in water, and this circumstance\r\nhas impressed its seal upon their organization. Nevertheless, their\r\nforms are very varied; they are generally oblong, compressed laterally.\r\nThey have no neck, the head being merely a prolongation of the trunk. In\r\nthe majority of instances, the body is covered with scales, generally a\r\nthin bony substance developed out of the skin and overlapping each\r\nother, like the tiles of a roof.\r\n\r\nNothing is more remarkable than the variety and brilliancy of colour in\r\nfishes; they present almost every gradation, from golden or silver, and\r\nother dazzling colours, mingling with shades of blue, green, red, and\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nFishes are essentially formed for swimming (Fig. 340), and all their\r\nmembers are adapted for this purpose. The anterior members, which\r\ncorrespond with the arms in man and the wings in birds, are attached to\r\neach side of the trunk, immediately behind the head, and form the\r\n_pectoral fins_. The posterior members occupy the lower surface of the\r\nbody, and form the _ventral fins_. The latter, which are always over the\r\nventral line, may be before, beneath, or behind the former. Fishes\r\npossess, besides, fins in odd numbers. The fins which erect themselves\r\non the back are called the back or _dorsal fins_, those at the end of\r\nthe tail are the _caudal fins_; finally, there is frequently another\r\nattached to the lower extremity of the body, which is called the _anal\r\nfin_. These fins are always nearly of the same structure, consisting\r\ngenerally of a fold of the skin, supported by slender, flexible,\r\ncartilaginous or osseous rays, connected by a thin membrane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 340. Skeleton of the Common Perch.\r\n\r\n_a_, the inter-maxillary bone; _b_, the maxillary bone; _d_, the gills;\r\n_c_, the under jaw; _f_, the inter-operculum; _g g_, the vertebral\r\ncolumn; _h_, the pectoral fin; _i_, the ventral fin; _k_ and _l_, the\r\ndorsal fins; _m_, the anal fin; _n_, the caudal fin.]\r\n\r\nThe muscles which bind together the vertebral column are so much\r\ndeveloped in fishes as well as others of the superior animals, that they\r\nconstitute in them alone the principal part of the body. The caudal,\r\ndorsal, and anal fins act as outlying oars; the pectoral and ventral\r\nfins assist in progression, at the same time that they help to maintain\r\nthe equilibrium of the animal and guide and direct its movements, which\r\nare generally astonishing from their rapidity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 341. Swimming bladder of the Carp.]\r\n\r\nAn organ, which belongs properly to fishes[15] (Fig. 341), and which is\r\nusually considered as their chief aid in swimming, is a large bladder\r\nsituated within the body, between the dorsal spine and the abdomen. This\r\nis usually called the _swimming bladder_. According to the volume this\r\nbladder assumes, the animal can increase or diminish the specific\r\ngravity of its body; that is, it can remain in equilibrium or ascend or\r\ndescend in the bosom of the waters; it is, moreover, remarked that it is\r\nvery small in those species which swim at the bottom of the water, and\r\nMr. Gosse says there is some reason for considering it to be the first\r\nrudimentary form of the air-breathing lung.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 342. Anatomy of the Carp.\r\n\r\n_br_, the branchiæ, or gill openings; _c_, the heart; _f_, the liver;\r\n_vn_, swimming bladders; _ci_, intestinal canal; _o_, the ovarium; _u_,\r\nurethra; _a_, anus; _o'_, oviduct.]\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the head, two large openings are observed in most\r\nfishes; these are the gill-openings. Their anterior edge is mobile, and\r\nthey are raised or lowered to serve the purposes of respiration; under\r\nthis species of covercle are the gills, or branchiæ. These usually\r\nconsist of many rows of thin membranous plates, hung on slender arches\r\nof bone, placed on each side of the head, usually protected by a bony\r\nplate made up of several pieces, called the _gill-covers_. The breathing\r\nis produced by water taken in at the mouth, which passes over the\r\ngill-membranes, and is ejected through an orifice at the hind margin of\r\nthe gill-covers. During the contact of the water with the gills, the\r\nblood which circulates in these organs, and which communicates to them\r\nthe red colour by which we recognize them, combines chemically with the\r\noxygen of the air which the water holds in solution when it flows freely\r\nat the ordinary temperature in presence of the air. The blood is thus\r\noxygenized, or made fit for respiration.\r\n\r\nThe heart in fishes is placed between the inferior parts of the\r\nbranchial arch, and consists of a ventricle and an auricle (Fig. 342).\r\nIt corresponds with the right half of the heart in the Mammifera and\r\nbirds, for it receives the venous blood from all parts of the body and\r\nsends it to the gills. From this organ the blood is delivered into one\r\ngreat artery, which creeps along the vertebral column.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 343. A Fish's Eye.\r\n\r\n_i_, crystallized pupil; _ee'_, cornea; _mm'_, choroid; _h_, posterior\r\nchambers; _c_, optic nerve.]\r\n\r\nThe eye in fishes is generally very large--we may even say enormous\r\nrelative to the size of the head--and without true eyelids; the skin\r\nusually passes over the ocular globe, and becomes from this point so\r\ntransparent that the luminary rays traverse it. This light covering is\r\nall the eyelid belonging to fishes. The interior of the eye is covered\r\nby the membrane called _choroid_, the thin external leaf of which, in\r\nconsequence of the presence of innumerable microscopic crystals,\r\npresents the appearance of a gold or silver-coloured coating, which\r\ngives to the iris that extraordinary brilliancy which belongs to the\r\nfish's eye. The crystalline lens is voluminous, spherical, and\r\ndiaphanous. When the fish is cooked, the crystalline lens constitutes\r\nthat opaque and hard white substance which often comes under the teeth\r\nin eating fish of a certain size. Cuvier suspected, what anglers now\r\nknow to be true, that those active chasseurs of the deep saw far and\r\nvery clearly.[16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 344. Teeth of the Bream.]\r\n\r\nIf fishes have great eyes, they have, on the other hand, very small\r\nears. This organ, it is found, has no exterior opening. It forms a\r\ncavity in the interior of the cranium, which is far from presenting the\r\ncomplicated structure of the ear in mammifers and birds. In spite,\r\nhowever, of the imperfect structure, fishes are sensible to the least\r\nnoise. In consequence, silence is a rigorous law with the fisherman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 345. Teeth of the Carp.]\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the mouth and teeth are very variable in fishes; these\r\norgans are in proportion to their voracity, which in many of these\r\nbeings is very great. The form and development of the buccal pieces are\r\nalso very various. Some species are toothless, but in most fishes the\r\nteeth are very numerous. They are sometimes attached, not alone to the\r\ntwo jaws, but also to the palate, to the tongue, and upon the interior\r\nof the branchial arch, and even in the back mouth, that is to say, upon\r\nthe ospharyngeal, which surrounds the mouth of the oesophagus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 346. Teeth of the Trout.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 347. Teeth of the Gold-fish Dorada.]\r\n\r\nThe form of their teeth is very variable both in arrangement and\r\nposition: some are in the form of an elongated cone, either straight or\r\ncurved. When small and numerous, they are comparable to the points of\r\nthe cards used in carding wool or cotton. Sometimes they are so slender\r\nand dense as to resemble the piles of velvet, and often, from their very\r\nminute size, their presence is more easily ascertained by the finger\r\nthan the eye. In some members of the Salmonidæ, for instance, we find a\r\nrow of teeth on the bone that forms the middle ridge of the palate,\r\nwhich is called the _vornex_. On each side of this is another row on the\r\n_palatine_ bones, and outside these is a third pair of rows on the upper\r\njaw-bones. Some fishes have flat teeth, with a cutting edge in front of\r\nthe jaws, like a true incisor; others have them rounded or oval, adapted\r\nto bruise or crush the various substances on which they feed.\r\n\r\nThe oesophagus connected with the mouth is short in fishes; the stomach\r\nand intestines vary in form and dimensions. Digestion is very rapid with\r\nthese beings. Most of them feed on flesh, but there are a few where the\r\nmouth is without teeth, which feed on vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe growth of fishes is slow or very rapid, according to the abundance\r\nof food; they can suffer a very long fast, but in that state they become\r\ndiminutive in size, and finally perish of exhaustion. At certain seasons\r\nan irresistible impulse brings the two sexes together. Many species\r\nwhose ordinary appearance is dull and unsightly now shine in the most\r\nbrilliant colours. The female soon after lays her eggs, the number of\r\nwhich passes all imagination. Nature seems to have accumulated in the\r\nbody of each female myriads of eggs--a wise provision, which is rendered\r\nnecessary by the numerous causes of destruction which threaten them in\r\ntheir native element. The eggs, abandoned by the females to the mercy of\r\nthe waves, are fecundated after being deposited by the milt of the\r\nmales. Such is a very brief summary of the organization of fishes, which\r\nhave been briefly described as vertebrate, cold-blooded animals,\r\nbreathing by means of gills; living in water, moving through the water\r\nby means of their fins, and reproducing their kind by means of eggs, or\r\nspawn. And now a few words on their classification.\r\n\r\nFishes naturally divide themselves into two series, according to the\r\ncomposition of their internal skeleton. This is usually osseous;\r\nnevertheless, a whole group of them constantly retain the cartilaginous\r\nor fibro-cartilaginous state. With some this frame presents even less\r\npower of resistance, and remains membranous.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely upon this peculiarity of structure that we found the\r\ngreat division of the class of fishes into two great groups of\r\nCARTILAGINOUS and OSSEOUS fishes, the first being again subdivided into\r\nthree orders: namely, I. _Cyclostomata_, II. _Selachia_, III.\r\n_Sturiona_. The second into four orders: I. _Plectognathii_, II.\r\n_Lophobranchii_, III. _Malacopterygii_, IV. _Acanthopterygii_. Agassiz's\r\nsystem of classification of fish, founded on the form of the scales, is\r\nperhaps better suited than this to the palæontologist, but the one given\r\nabove, founded as it is principally on the internal parts of the animal,\r\nis better suited to the zoologist. Agassiz's orders are the _Ctenoid_,\r\ntype, _Chromis_, _Placoid_, _Ganoid_, and _Cycloid_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARTILAGINOUS FISHES.\r\n\r\nCartilaginous fishes are generally animals of considerable size, their\r\nstructure ranging from ordinary fishes to eels. They are chiefly\r\nsea-fishes, only a few species being river-fishes. Naturalists divide\r\nthem into two orders; namely, those having the gills free on the outer\r\nedge (the gilled _Chondropterygeans_), and those having these organs\r\nfixed on both edges. The first order comprehend three families: I.\r\n_Cyclostomata_, or Eels, Lampreys, &c., in which the mouth forms a\r\nsucker; II. _Selachians_, including Raias and Sharks, in which the mouth\r\nis furnished with jaws; III. _Sturiona_, or Sturgeons, which have the\r\ngills free.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. CYCLOSTOMATA.\r\n\r\nThe first are characterised by the singular conformation of the mouth,\r\nwhich is formed for suction. The body is elongated, naked, and viscous,\r\nreminding us of serpents in their external form; they have neither\r\npectoral nor ventral fins; their vertebræ are reduced to simple\r\ncartilaginous rings, scarcely perceptible one from the other, traversed\r\nby tendons, and covered by a second and more solid series of rings,\r\nwhich surround the soft cartilaginous spine. Their gills, in place of\r\npresenting the comb-like appearance of other fishes, have something of\r\nthe form of a purse. The lampreys may be considered as the type of this\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 348. The Lamprey (Petromyzon marinus).]\r\n\r\nThe Lampreys (_Petromyzon_) are cylindrical, with seven gill-openings on\r\neach side of the neck, forming two longitudinal lines; mouth round,\r\narmed with many teeth. The Sea Lamprey, _P. marinus_ (Fig. 348), belongs\r\nto the Mediterranean; it is also found in the German Ocean, and the\r\nfriend who supplies this note has caught it with cockle bait in the\r\nSouth Esk, Forfarshire. In the spring it ascends the rivers, where it is\r\nsometimes caught in abundance. Full-grown it is about three feet long,\r\nmarbled brown upon yellow; the dorsal fins are separated by long\r\nintervals; its mouth is circular and surrounded by a fleshy lip,\r\nfurnished with cirri, having a cartilaginous plate for support; it is\r\nprovided on its internal surface with many circular rows of strong\r\nteeth, some single, the others double.\r\n\r\nThe Lamprey feeds on worms, molluscs, and small fishes; its mouth is a\r\npowerful sucker, by the aid of which it attaches itself to fishes often\r\nof great size, and sucks them like a leech. It is taken by hook and\r\nline, and speared by a sort of barbed harpoon, like the trident of the\r\nmythological Neptune, which is thrown, javelin fashion, at the animal\r\nwhen seen at the bottom of the water; the flesh is fat and delicate. In\r\nthe twelfth century one of our kings, Henry I., surfeited himself at\r\nElbeuf by partaking too largely of the Lamprey. The river-lamprey\r\nresembles the above in its general conformation, but is much smaller,\r\nand differs in the armature of the mouth, having only a single circular\r\nrow of teeth. It is blackish above, silvery beneath, and is common in\r\nthe markets of London and Paris, being frequently taken in the Seine. A\r\nsmaller species, about ten inches in length, never leaves the fresh\r\nwaters. It resembles the last species in colour, but its two dorsal fins\r\nare continuous; it is found in most European rivers and brooks. In some\r\nof the English rivers they are frequently taken in the eel-pots,\r\nweighing two and three pounds. They frequent stony bottoms, where they\r\nfind small animals on which they feed. In its larva state it was long\r\nconsidered to be a distinct species of _Ammocætes_; it is now, however,\r\nascertained that it only acquires its perfect form at the end of its\r\nsecond or third year.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SELACHIA.\r\n\r\nThe Selachians include a great number of cartilaginous fishes, varying\r\nmuch in form, including the rays, dog-fish, skate, torpedo, hammer-fish,\r\nsharks, and saw-fish; they have pectoral and ventral fins. On each side\r\nof the neck, on the lower surface, are five gill-openings, in form of a\r\nslit to each gill. Many of the species have two _blow-holes_ in the\r\nupper part of the head. The order is divided into Raiadæ and Squalidæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAIADÆ.\r\n\r\nOf the RAIADÆ there are several genera, and many species. In\r\n_Cephaloptera_ the head is truncated, with large, lateral eyes. In\r\n_Myliobates_ it is projecting, the pectoral fins extending like wings.\r\nIn _Trygon_ it is enclosed by the pectorals. In the Skate (_Raia_) the\r\nbody is rhomboidal, tail without spine, but two small dorsals near the\r\ntop. In the _Torpedo_ the body is nearly round, the tail short and\r\nfleshy, with two dorsals and a caudal fin.\r\n\r\nThe White Ray, _Raia batis_ (Fig. 349), reminds us of the lozenge\r\nshape, the point of the muzzle forming the lower angle, the longest ray\r\nof each pectoral forming the lateral angles, while the summit of the\r\ntail forms the last angle; the whole surface seems flat, but a swelling\r\nis distinguishable towards the head, on the upper surface, which bears,\r\nas it were, the contour of the body, properly so called, namely, the\r\nthree cavities of the head, the throat, and the belly, which occupy the\r\ncentre of the lozenge, beyond which the pectoral fins extend. These\r\nfins, though covered with a thick skin, permit the cartilaginous rays,\r\nwith their articulations, to be very distinctly seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 349. The White Ray (Raia batis).]\r\n\r\nThe head of the white ray, which terminates in a muzzle slightly\r\npointed, is attached behind to the cavity of the breast. The mouth,\r\nplaced in the lower part of the head and far from the extremity of the\r\nmuzzle, is elongated; its edges are cartilaginous, and furnished with\r\nmany rows of hooked and pointed teeth; the nostrils are placed in front\r\nof the mouth. The eyes, which open in the upper part of the head, are\r\nhalf projecting, and protected in part by a continuation of the soft,\r\nelastic, and retractile skin which covers the head. Immediately behind\r\nthe eyes are two blow-holes, which communicate with the interior of the\r\nmouth. The animal is able to open and close these holes at pleasure, by\r\nmeans of an extensible membrane, which acts as a sort of valve. Through\r\nthese holes it ejects the superabundant water beyond what is necessary\r\nfor respiration. In its general colour the animal is ashy grey on its\r\nupper surface; white, with rows of black spots, below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 350. The Lump-fish (Raia clavata).]\r\n\r\nIts tail is long, flexible, and slender, acting at once as a rudder and\r\na weapon of offence or defence. When lying in ambush, nearly buried in\r\nmud at the bottom of the sea, and it has no desire to change its\r\nposition, a rapid and sudden stroke of this formidable weapon, armed\r\nwith hooked bones on its upper surface, arrests its victim by wounding\r\nor killing it, without disturbing the mud or seaweed by which it is\r\ncovered. This species sometimes attains a very considerable size, and\r\ntheir flesh is firm and nourishing; but the larger specimens rarely\r\napproach inhabited shores, even when the female desires to lay her eggs.\r\nThese eggs have a very singular shape, differing from almost every\r\nother fish, and particularly from those of all other osseous fishes.\r\nThey are quadrangular, a little flat, each of the four corners\r\nterminating in a small cylindrical beak--a kind of pocket formed of a\r\nstrong and transparent membrane.\r\n\r\nThe Lump-fish, _R. clavata_ (Fig. 350), so called in consequence of its\r\narmature, inhabits every European sea; sometimes it attains the length\r\nof twelve feet, and, being excellent eating, is much sought after by\r\nfishermen. It is frequently seen with the skate in European markets. A\r\nray of great curving spines occupies the back and extends to the end of\r\nthe tail; two similar spines are above, and two below the point of the\r\nmuzzle. Two others are placed before, and three behind the eyes. Each\r\nside of the tail is furnished with a row of shorter spines; the whole\r\nsurface, in short, bristles with larger or smaller spines, justifying\r\nthe name of buckler-fish; for these are not given by way of ornament,\r\nbut defence. The colour of the upper surface is generally brown, with\r\nwhitish spots. The tail, which exceeds the body in length, presents\r\ntowards the end two small dorsals, terminating in a caudal fin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 351. The Cramp-fish (Torpedo marmorata).]\r\n\r\nRay-fish of all kinds are inhabitants of the deep sea, but they change\r\naccording to the seasons. While stormy weather prevails, they hide\r\nthemselves in the depth of the ocean, where they lie in ambush, creeping\r\nalong the bottom. But they do not always live at the bottom. They rise\r\noccasionally to the surface far from the shore, eagerly chasing other\r\ninhabitants of the deep, lashing the water with their formidable tails\r\nand fins, springing out of the water, and making it foam again under\r\ntheir gambols.\r\n\r\nWhen pursuing their prey the rays employ their great pectoral fins,\r\nwhich resemble wings, and are aided by a very delicate and mobile tail;\r\nthey beat the waters in order to fall unexpectedly upon their prey, as\r\nthe eagle swoops down upon its victim. It may thus be called the king of\r\nfishes, as the eagle is the king of birds.\r\n\r\nThe Cramp-fish, _Torpedo marmorata_ (Fig. 351), has considerable analogy\r\nwith the Raia. Its flattened body forms a roundish disk, beyond which\r\nits rays form large pectoral fins; but the humeral girdle which carries\r\nthem, carries also, in a great hollow, a most singular organic\r\napparatus, which possesses the property of producing violent electrical\r\ncommotions. This apparatus is placed in the interval between the end of\r\nthe muzzle and the extremity of the fin, and completes the rounded disk\r\nof the body. The mouth is small, the slit crosswise; the jaws bare; the\r\nteeth in squares of five. The eyes are small; behind them are two\r\nstar-like spout-holes. On the lower surface of the breast are two rows\r\nof small transverse slits, openings of the gill pouches, like those of\r\nthe rays. The tail is thick, short, and conical, carrying part of the\r\nventral, and terminating in a sort of caudal fin. On the back are two\r\nsmall, soft, and adipose fins. The skin is smooth; its colour varies\r\nwith the species; generally it is reddish-brown, with eye-like spots of\r\na deep blue in the centre; sometimes azure, and surrounded by a great\r\nbrownish circle; the spots being five or six. These curious fishes are\r\nfound in the Channel and on the shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe electrical effects produced on the fisherman who seizes them were\r\nnoted from early times; but Redi, the Italian naturalist of the\r\nseventeenth century, was the first who studied them scientifically.\r\nHaving caught and landed one of them with every precaution, \"I had\r\nscarcely touched and pressed it with my hand,\" says the Italian\r\nnaturalist, \"than I experienced a tingling sensation, which extended to\r\nmy arms and shoulders, which was followed by a disagreeable trembling,\r\nwith a painful and acute sensation in the elbow joint, which made me\r\nwithdraw my arm immediately.\"\r\n\r\nRéaumur also made some observations upon the Torpedo. \"The benumbing\r\ninfluence,\" he says, \"is very different from any similar sensation. All\r\nover the arm there is a commotion which it is impossible to describe,\r\nbut which, so far as comparison can be made, resembles the sensation\r\nproduced by striking the tender part of the elbow against a hard\r\nsubstance.\" Redi remarks, besides, that the pain and trembling sensation\r\nresulting from the touch diminishes as the death of the Torpedo\r\napproaches, and that it ceases altogether when the animal dies.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, the fishermen affirmed that the sensation\r\nwas even communicated through the line by which it was caught, and even\r\nby the water. Redi does not deny this phenomenon, neither does he\r\nconfirm it. He states that the action of the animal is never more\r\nenergetic than when it is strongly pressed by the hand, and makes\r\nviolent efforts to escape. Neither Redi nor Réaumur, however, could\r\nexplain the cause of the strange phenomenon. It was reserved for Dr.\r\nWalsh, a fellow of the Royal Society of London, to demonstrate the fact\r\nthat the power was electrical in its nature. This he did by numerous\r\nexperiments, which he made in the Isle of Ré. The following are some of\r\nhis experiments.\r\n\r\nHe placed a living torpedo upon a clean wet towel; from a plate he\r\nsuspended two pieces of brass wire by means of silken cord, which served\r\nto isolate them. Round the torpedo were eight persons, standing on\r\nisolating substances. One end of the brass wire was supported by the wet\r\ntowel, the other end being placed in a basin full of water. The first\r\nperson had a finger of one hand in this basin, and a finger of the other\r\nin a second basin, also full of water. The second person placed a finger\r\nof one hand in this second basin, and a finger of the other hand in a\r\nthird basin. The third person did the same, and so on, until a complete\r\nchain was established between the eight persons and nine basins. Into\r\nthe ninth basin the end of the second brass wire was plunged, while Dr.\r\nWalsh applied the other end to the back of the torpedo, thus\r\nestablishing a complete conducting circle. At the moment when the\r\nexperimenter touched the torpedo, the eight actors in the experiment\r\nfelt a sudden shock, similar in all respects to that communicated by the\r\nshock of a Leyden jar, only less intense.\r\n\r\nWhen the torpedo was placed on an isolated supporter, it communicated to\r\nmany persons similarly placed from forty to fifty shocks in a minute and\r\na half. Each effort made by the animal, in order to give them, was\r\naccompanied by the depression of its eyes, which were slightly\r\nprojecting in their natural state, and seemed to be drawn within their\r\norbits, while the other parts of the body remained immovable.\r\n\r\nIf only one of the two organs of the torpedo is touched it happens\r\nthat, in place of a strong and sudden shock, only a slight sensation is\r\nexperienced--a numbness, or start, rather than a shock. The same result\r\nfollowed with every experiment tried. The animal was tried with a\r\nnon-conducting rod, and no shock followed; glass, or a rod covered with\r\nwax, produced no effect; touched with a metallic wire, a violent shock\r\nfollowed. Melloni, Matteucci, Becquerel, and Breschet have all made the\r\nsame experiments with the same results--Matteucci having ascertained\r\nthat the shock produced by the torpedo is comparable to that given by a\r\nvoltaic pile of a hundred to a hundred and fifty pairs of plates.\r\n\r\nThe organ which produces this curious result is formed like a half-moon;\r\nit is double, and placed on each side of the mouth of the respiratory\r\norgans. It consists of a multitude of small prisms arranged parallel the\r\none to the other and perpendicularly to the surface; twelve hundred and\r\nsixty-two of these prisms have been counted in one of the two organs of\r\na torpedo, three feet in length. Without entering into the anatomical\r\ndescriptions which have been given by Stannius, Max Schultze, Breschet,\r\nand others, we may mention here that all the small parallelopipedes,\r\nwhich enter into their structure, are separated one from the other by\r\nwalls of cellular tissue, in which are distributed the vessels and\r\nnerves. The nervous threads which each apparatus receives are divided\r\ninto four principal trunks. According to modern authors, the electricity\r\nis elaborated in the brain under the influence of the will. It is\r\nafterwards transferred by means of the nervous threads into the\r\nprincipal organ, where it serves the purpose of charging the numerous\r\nlittle voltaic piles which constitute the organ of commotion.\r\n\r\nIt is, nevertheless, necessary to receive our comparisons of the\r\napparatus of the torpedo with the voltaic pile of our laboratories with\r\ncaution. The apparatus resembles a good conducting body, which is\r\ncapable of being strongly electrified; it is sufficient to touch one of\r\nthe surfaces in order to receive the shock. But if the little prisms\r\ncomposing it were charged like our voltaic piles, it would be necessary\r\nto touch both their surfaces in order to receive the shock. No perfect\r\nanalogy can therefore exist between this natural apparatus and the\r\nscientific instrument named after Volta.\r\n\r\nIt is possible by the aid of heat to restore the extinct or suspended\r\nelectrical functions of the torpedo. Retained in a tank of sea-water a\r\nyard in height by a third of that in diameter, and at 22° Centigrade in\r\ntemperature, a torpedo preserved its faculties during five or six hours;\r\nanother, which remained during ten hours in a very small quantity of\r\nsea-water at a temperature of 10° to 11° Cent., and which seemed dead,\r\nrevived a little when placed in water at 20° Cent., and gave shocks\r\nduring an hour. If held firmly by the tail, and pressed both above and\r\nbelow by a platinum rod to gather the true electricity, the animal\r\ncontracts itself violently; but its movements are not always accompanied\r\nby electrical discharges, which demonstrate that the jets of electrical\r\nmatter are not the result simply of the muscular contractions, but that\r\nthey are subject to the will of the animal, and evidently given for\r\nresisting its enemies, and benumbing its prey. How wonderful and varied\r\nare the resources which Nature grants to her creatures in order to\r\nsecure their existence!\r\n\r\n\r\nSQUALIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThis family approaches more to the Raias than any other fish; but all\r\nthe species have a lengthened body, merging into a thick tail, pectorals\r\nmoderate in size, gill-openings on the sides of the neck, and not\r\nbeneath the body, as in the Raia; eyes lateral; and the roughness of\r\ntheir skin is a protection from their enemies. The family comprehends\r\nthe _Sharks_, _Dog fishes_, _Hammerheads_, and _Saw fish_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 352. The Shark (Carcharius vulgaris).]\r\n\r\nThe sharks are said to attain the length of twenty and even thirty feet;\r\nbut its size is not its worst attribute. It has received, besides,\r\nstrength and terrible arms. Ferocious, voracious, impetuous, and\r\ninsatiable, spread over almost every climate, an inhabitant of every\r\nsea, and recently not seldom seen on our own shores, the shark rapidly\r\npursues every fish, which fly at its approach; and threatens with its\r\nwide gullet the unfortunate victims of shipwreck, shutting them out from\r\nall hope of safety.\r\n\r\nThe body of the shark is long, and its skin is studded with small\r\ntubercles: this skin becomes so hard, and takes so high a polish, that\r\nit is employed for various ornamental purposes. This resisting power\r\nprotects the shark from the bites of every inhabitant of the sea, if\r\nthere be any daring enough to approach it with that view.\r\n\r\nThe back and sides of the Shark, _Carcharius vulgaris_ (Fig. 352), are\r\nof an ashy brown; beneath it is faded white. The head is flat, and\r\nterminates in a muzzle slightly rounded. Its terrible mouth is in the\r\nform of a semicircle, and of enormous size; the contour of the upper jaw\r\nof a shark of ten yards length being about two yards wide, and its\r\nthroat being of a proportionate diameter to this monstrous opening. When\r\nthe throat of the animal is open we see beyond the lips, which are\r\nstraight and of the consistence of leather, certain plates of teeth,\r\nwhich are triangular, dentate, and white as ivory. If the shark is an\r\nadult it has in the upper as in the lower jaw six rows of these\r\nmurderous arms, an arsenal ready to tear and rend its victim. These\r\nteeth take different motions according to the will of the animal, and\r\nobedient to the muscles round their base, by means of which it can erect\r\nor retract its various rows of teeth; it can even erect a portion of any\r\nrow, while the others remain at rest in their bed. Thus this far-seeing\r\ntyrant of the ocean knows how to measure the number and power of the\r\narms necessary to destroy its prey: for the destruction of the weak and\r\ndefenceless one row of teeth suffices; for the more formidable adversary\r\nit has a whole arsenal at command.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the shark are small, and nearly round; the iris of a deep\r\ngreen, the eyeball, shaped in a transversal slit, is bluish; its scent\r\nis very subtle; its fins are strong and rough.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral fins are triangular, and much larger than the others,\r\nextending on each side, and giving powerful aid in swimming. The caudal\r\nfin is divided into two very unequal lobes, the upper extending in a\r\nsloping direction to twice the length of the other. This tail is\r\npossessed of immense power, and is capable of breaking the limb of a\r\nrobust man by a single stroke.\r\n\r\nDuring the hot season the male and female seek each other; they approach\r\nthe coast roving in company, forgetting their ferocity for the time. The\r\neggs are hatched at several periods in the ovary, from which the little\r\nones issue two or three at a time.\r\n\r\nThe shark, as soon as born, becomes the scourge of the sea. He seizes\r\nall that come near him. He eats the cuttle-fish, molluscs, and fishes;\r\namong others, flounders and cod-fish. But the prey which has the\r\ngreatest charm for him is man; the shark loves him dearly, but it is\r\nwith the affection of the gourmand. It even manifests, according to some\r\nauthors, a preference for certain races. If we may believe some\r\ntravellers, when several varieties of human food comes in its way, the\r\nshark prefers the European to the Asiatic, and both to the negro. Still,\r\nwhatever may be the colour, he seeks eagerly for human flesh, and haunts\r\nthe neighbourhood where it hopes to find the precious morsel. He follows\r\nthe ship in which his instinct tells him it is to be found, and makes\r\nextraordinary efforts to reach it. He has been known to leap into a boat\r\nin order to seize the frightened fishermen; he throws himself upon the\r\nship, cleaving the waves at full speed, to snap up some unhappy sailor\r\nwho has shown himself beyond the bulwarks. He follows the course of the\r\nslaver, watching for the horrors of the middle passage, ready to engulf\r\nthe negroes' corpses as they are thrown into the sea. Commerson relates\r\na significant fact bearing on the subject. The corpse of a negro had\r\nbeen suspended from a yard-arm twenty feet above the level of the sea. A\r\nshark was seen to make many efforts to reach the body, and it finally\r\nsucceeded in seizing it, member by member, undisturbed by the cries of\r\nthe horror-stricken crew assembled on deck to witness the strange\r\nspectacle. In order that an animal so large and heavy should be able to\r\nthrow itself to this height, the muscles of the tail and posterior parts\r\nof the body must have an astonishing power.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the shark being placed in the lower part of the head, it\r\nbecomes necessary to turn itself round in the water before it can seize\r\nthe object which is placed above him. He meets with men bold enough to\r\nprofit by this conformation, and chase this formidable and ferocious\r\ncreature. On the African coast the negroes attack the shark in his own\r\nelement, swimming towards him, and seizing the moment when he turns\r\nhimself to rip up his belly with a sharp knife. This act of courage and\r\naudacity cannot, however, be said to be shark-fishing. The fishing\r\noperation is conducted as follows:--Choosing a dark night, a hook is\r\nprepared by burying it in a piece of lard, and attaching it to a long\r\nand solid wire chain; the shark looks askance at this prey, feels it,\r\nthen leaves it; he is tempted by withdrawing the bait, when he follows,\r\nand swallows it gluttonously. He now tries to sink into the water, but,\r\nchecked by the chain, he struggles and fights. By-and-by he gets\r\nexhausted, and the chain is drawn up in such a manner as to raise the\r\nhead out of the water. Another cord is now thrown out with a running\r\nknot or loop, in which the body of the shark is caught about the origin\r\nof the tail. Thus bound, the captured shark is soon hoisted on deck, as\r\nrepresented in PL. XXV. On the quarter-deck of the ship he is put to\r\ndeath, not without great precaution, however, for he is still a\r\nformidable foe, from his terrible bites and from the still dangerous\r\nblows of his tail. Moreover, he dies hard, and long resists the most\r\nformidable wounds.\r\n\r\nCaptain Basil Hall gives a spirited sketch of the appearance and capture\r\nof one of those dreaded fishes; a capture in which the whole ship's\r\ncompany, captain, officers, young gentlemen inclusive, shout in\r\ntriumphant exultation as the body of the shark flounders in impotent\r\nrage on poop or forecastle.\r\n\r\n\"The sharp-curved dorsal fin of a huge shark was seen rising about six\r\ninches above the water, and cutting the glazed surface of the sea by as\r\nfine a line as if a sickle had been drawn along it: 'Messenger, run to\r\nthe cook for a piece of pork,' cried the captain, taking the command\r\nwith as much glee as if an enemy's cruiser had been in sight. 'Where's\r\nyour hook, quartermaster?' 'Here, sir, here,' cried the fellow, feeling\r\nthe point, and declaring it was as sharp as any lady's needle, and in\r\nthe next instant piercing with it a huge junk of pork weighing four or\r\nfive pounds. The hook, which is as large as one's little finger, has a\r\ncurvature about as large as a man's hand when half closed, and is six or\r\neight inches in length, while a formidable line, furnished with three or\r\nfour feet of chain attached to the end of the mizen topsail halyard, is\r\nnow cast into the ship's wake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXV.--Shark Fishing.]\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes the very instant the bait is cast over the stern the shark\r\nflies at it with such eagerness that he actually springs partially out\r\nof the water. This, however, is rare. On these occasions he gorges the\r\nbait, the hook, and a foot or two of the chain, without any\r\nmastication, and darts off with the treacherous prize with such\r\nprodigious velocity that it makes the rope crack again as soon as the\r\ncoil is drawn out. Much dexterity is required in the hand which holds\r\nthe line at this moment. A bungler is apt to be too precipitate, and\r\njerk away the hook before it has got far enough into the shark's maw.\r\nThe secret of the sport is to let the monster gulp down the whole bait,\r\nand then to give the line a violent pull, by which the barbed point\r\nburies itself in the coat of the stomach. When the hook is first fixed,\r\nit spins out like the log line of a ship going twelve knots.\r\n\r\n\"The suddenness of the jerk with which the poor devil is brought up\r\noften turns him quite over. No sailor, however, thinks of hauling a\r\nshark on board merely by the rope fastened to the hook. To prevent the\r\nline breaking, the hook snapping, or the jaw being torn away, a running\r\nbowline is adopted. This noose is slipped down the rope and passed over\r\nthe monster's head, and is made to join at the point of junction of the\r\ntail with the body; and now the first part of the fun is held to be\r\ncompleted. The vanquished enemy is easily drawn up over the taffrail,\r\nand flung on deck, to the delight of the crew.\"\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the shark is leathery, of bad taste, and difficult to\r\ndigest. Nevertheless, the negroes of Guinea feed upon it, but not until\r\nit has been made tender and eatable by long preservation. In many parts\r\nof the Mediterranean coast small sharks are taken from their mother's\r\nbelly and eaten. The under part of adult sharks is also eaten by the\r\nfishermen after the bad parts have been removed. In Norway and Iceland\r\nthis part of the animal is dried in the air during the most part of the\r\ntwelve months. The Icelanders also use the fat of the animal; the liver\r\nof one of them, according to Pontoppidan, will furnish a great quantity\r\nof oil.\r\n\r\nWe have thus, with the care it deserves, painted the portrait of the\r\nshark. The original is by no means beautiful; but, frightful as it may\r\nbe, our description would be incomplete if we did not add that divine\r\nhonours have been granted to this monster of the waters. Man worships\r\nforce; he knows the hand which crushes, the teeth which rend. He\r\nrespects the master or the king who strikes, and he venerates the shark.\r\nThe inhabitants of several parts of the African coast worship the shark;\r\nthey call it their _joujou_, and consider its stomach the road to\r\nheaven. Three or four times in the year they celebrate the festival of\r\nthe shark, which is done in this wise.\r\n\r\nThey all move in their boats to the middle of the river, where they\r\ninvoke, with the strangest ceremonies, the protection of the great\r\nshark. They offer to him poultry and goats, in order to satisfy his\r\nsacred appetite. But this is nothing; an infant is every year sacrificed\r\nto the monster, which has been reared for the purpose from its birth; it\r\nis fêted and nourished for the sacrifice from its birth to the age of\r\nten. On the day of the fête it is bound to a post on a sandy point at\r\nlow water; as the tide rises, the child may utter cries of horror, but\r\nit is abandoned to the waves, and the sharks arrive. The mother is not\r\nfar off; perhaps she weeps, but she dries her tears and thinks that her\r\nchild has entered heaven through this horrible gate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 353. The Pickled Dog-fish (Acanthias vulgaris).]\r\n\r\nThe Dog-fish, _Acanthias vulgaris_ (Fig. 353), which sometimes attains\r\nthe length of between three and four feet, is exceedingly voracious. It\r\nfeeds upon other fish, of which it destroys great quantities; it does\r\nnot hesitate to attack the fishermen, and especially bathers in the sea.\r\nIt places itself in ambush, like the Raias, in order to attack its prey.\r\nThe flesh of the dog-fish is hard, smells of musk, and is rarely eaten;\r\nbut the skin becomes an article of commerce, and is known as _shagrin_,\r\nbeing, like the skin of the shark, used for making spectacle-cases and\r\nfor other ornamental purposes, for which its green colour and high\r\npolish recommend it. There is a smaller species than the preceding,\r\nwhich haunts rocky shores, where it lies in wait for its prey. Its spots\r\nare larger and more scattered, and its ventral fins are nearly square.\r\nIt feeds on molluscs, crustaceans, and small fishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 354. The Hammerhead (Zygæna malleus).]\r\n\r\nThe Hammerhead, _Zygæna malleus_ (Fig. 354), is chiefly distinguished by\r\nthe singular conformation of its head, which is flattened horizontally,\r\ntruncate in front, and the sides prolonged transversely, giving it the\r\nappearance of the head of a hammer. The eyes of this fish are placed at\r\nthe extremity of the lateral prolongations of the head; they are grey,\r\nprojecting, and the iris is gold-coloured. When the animal is irritated,\r\nthe colours of the iris become like flame, to the horror of the\r\nfishermen who behold them.\r\n\r\nBeneath the head and near to the junction of the trunk is the mouth,\r\nwhich is semicircular, and furnished on each jaw with three or four rows\r\nof large teeth, pointed and barbed on two sides.\r\n\r\nThe most common species in our seas is long and slender in the body,\r\nwhich is grey, the head blackish. It usually attains the length of\r\neleven or twelve feet, weighing occasionally nearly five hundred\r\npounds. Its boldness and voracity, and craving for blood, are more\r\nremarkable than its size. If the hammerhead has not the strength of the\r\nshark, it surpasses it in fury; few fishes are better known to sailors\r\nin consequence of its striking conformation. Its voracity often brings\r\nit round ships even in roadsteads, and near the coast. Its visits\r\nimpress themselves on the memory of the sailor, and he loves to relate\r\nhis hairbreadth escape from the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe saw-fish is distinguished from all other known fishes by the\r\nformidable arm which it carries in its head. This weapon is a\r\nprolongation of the muzzle, which, in place of being rounded off or\r\nreduced to a point, forms a long, strong, straight, sword-like\r\ntermination, flat on both sides, but on the two edges it is furnished\r\nwith numerous strong teeth of considerable length, which are\r\nprolongations of the hard, bony substance which forms the\r\nmuzzle--forming, in short, a sword-blade deeply toothed on each edge.\r\n\r\nThus armed, the saw, or sword-fish, as it is sometimes called, the\r\nlength of which is from twelve to fifteen feet, fearlessly attacks the\r\nmost formidable inhabitants of the sea. With its threatening weapon,\r\nsometimes two yards in length, it dares to measure its strength with the\r\nwhale. All fishermen who visit the northern seas assert that the meeting\r\nof these ocean potentates is always followed by a combat of the most\r\nsingular kind, in which the activity of the sword-fish is a match for\r\nthe formidable strength of the whale. Occasionally it dashes itself with\r\nsuch force against the sides of a ship, that its sword is broken in the\r\ntimber. In the British Museum the blade of a sword-fish may be seen\r\nwhich was thus implanted in the timber of a ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. STURIONA.\r\n\r\nIn the second division of cartilaginous fishes, or sturgeons, the gills\r\nare free, as in the ordinary fishes. In the sturgeon the gill-openings\r\nare a single, very wide orifice, with an operculum, but without\r\nradiating membrane. They are fishes of great size, living in the sea,\r\nbut ascending the larger rivers in the spawning season. Our space only\r\npermits us to notice the Chimæra and Sturgeon.\r\n\r\nThe naturalists Clusius and Aldrovandus compared the fish, to which they\r\ngave the name of _Chimæra arctica_, to the chimæra, a monster of\r\nmythological antiquity, which is represented with the body of a goat,\r\nthe head of a lion, the tail of a dragon, and a gaping throat which\r\nvomited flames. The strange form of this fish, the manner in which it\r\nmoves, the different parts of its muzzle, its mode of showing its teeth,\r\nits ape-like contortions and grimaces, its long tail, which acts with\r\nsuch rapidity,--reminding one not a little of a reptile,--are well\r\ncalculated to strike the imagination. At a later period mediæval\r\nnaturalists were contented to see in it a fish with a lion's head, and\r\nas the lion was then regarded as the king of animals, so the chimæra\r\nbecame the _Herring_ king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 355. The Arctic chimæra.]\r\n\r\nThe king of the herrings (Fig. 355) is from five to six feet in length,\r\nof a general silvery colour, spotted with brown. It inhabits the North\r\nSea, living on molluscs and crustaceans; occasionally, as if to justify\r\nthe title which has been given it, levying heavy contributions upon the\r\nherrings. Another species, _C. antarctica_, is found in the southern\r\nhemisphere, which greatly resembles, in its conformation and habits, the\r\nnorthern species. In both the end of the muzzle terminates in a\r\ncartilaginous appendage, which projects forward, curving afterwards over\r\nthe mouth. This extension assimilates to a crest.\r\n\r\nThe sturgeons (_Acipenser_) are among the largest fishes known. On this\r\naccount, as well as from their exterior conformation, they approach the\r\n_Squalidæ_. Their muscles, however, are less firmly knit, their flesh\r\nmore delicate, and their muscular strength consequently infinitely\r\nsmaller. Neither is their mouth armed with so many rows of teeth.\r\nMoreover, they are less voracious, and their habits are not at all\r\nferocious.\r\n\r\nThe sturgeons are sea-fishes which periodically ascend the larger\r\nrivers. Several species are known in Europe. They abound in the Black\r\nSea and Sea of Azof, but they are chiefly known as frequenting the Volga\r\nand the Danube. The enormous consumption of caviare in Russia leads to a\r\ndeadly pursuit of the common sturgeon in all the great European rivers,\r\nand this species is in a fair way of disappearing altogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 356. The Common Sturgeon (Acipenser sturio).]\r\n\r\nThe Common Sturgeon, _Acipenser sturio_ (Fig. 356), abounds in the North\r\nSea and the Mediterranean, and occasionally it appears in the Thames,\r\nthe Rhine, the Seine, the Loire, and the Gironde. It is usually about\r\ntwo yards to seven feet long, but has been known to attain the length of\r\nten or twelve feet. Its general colour is yellow, with a white belly.\r\nIt is rendered remarkable by the number and form of the osseous plates\r\nor scales, which cover the body like so many bucklers. Upon the back and\r\nbelly are no less than twelve to fifteen of these rough bony plates,\r\nrelieved by projections, which are pointed in the young, and soften down\r\nwith age. On each side is a row of thirty to thirty-five of these\r\ntriangular plates, separated from each other by considerable intervals.\r\nThe head is broad at the base, gradually contracting towards the point,\r\nand terminating in a conical muzzle. The mouth is large and considerably\r\nbehind the extremity of the muzzle, and its jaws, in place of teeth, are\r\nfurnished with cartilages. Between the mouth and the muzzle are four\r\nslender and very elastic barbs, or wattles, like so many little worms.\r\nIt is pretended that these wattles attract small fishes to the jaws of\r\nthe animal, while it conceals itself among the roots of aquatic plants.\r\n\r\nIn the sea the sturgeon feeds on herrings, mackerel, cod-fish, and other\r\nfishes of moderate size. In the rivers it attacks the salmon which\r\nascend them about the same time. Mingling with them, however, it seems a\r\ngiant. It deposits its eggs in great quantity, which are gathered and\r\nmade into caviare. Its flesh is delicate, and in countries where they\r\nare caught in quantities it is dried and preserved. The rivers which\r\nenter the Black and Caspian seas contain, besides the common sturgeon,\r\nmany other species of the same genus, the flesh of which is even more\r\ndelicate and _recherché_ than the common sturgeon. Among the ancients\r\nthis fish was held in unusual esteem. In Rome, in the time of the\r\nemperors, we read of sturgeons borne in triumph to the sound of\r\ninstruments, and laid upon tables fastidiously covered and decorated\r\nwith flowers.\r\n\r\nThe Great Sturgeon, which sometimes exceeds a thousand pounds, is only\r\nfound in the rivers which flow into the Caspian and Black seas. The\r\nVolga, the Don, and the Danube produce the largest species.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the Russian naturalist Pallas for the information we\r\npossess respecting the mode of taking the sturgeon in the Volga and\r\nother Asiatic rivers. Stakes are placed across the river, leaving just\r\nsufficient space between each pile to permit the animal to pass. Towards\r\nthe centre this dike forms an angle opposed to the current, and,\r\nconsequently, opposed to the fish which ascend the river towards the\r\nsummit of this angle. At this point there is an opening which leads into\r\na kind of enclosure, consisting of fillets towards the end of winter,\r\nand of osier-hurdles during summer. The fishermen establish themselves\r\nupon a sort of scaffold placed over the opening. When the fish is\r\nengaged in the reservoir, the men upon the scaffold drop a gate, which\r\nprevents his return to the sea. The movable bottom of the chamber is now\r\nraised, and the fishes easily taken, as represented in PL. XXVI.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen are informed during the day of the approach of the\r\nsturgeons to the great enclosure by the movement they communicate to\r\ncords suspended to small floating substances in the water. During the\r\nnight the sturgeons enter the enclosure, agitating by their movements\r\nother cords arranged round the hurdles. The agitation communicated to\r\nthe cord is sufficient to shut the gates behind; they are thus\r\nimprisoned by the dropping of the gate, which in falling sounds a bell\r\nto wake the watching fisherman on the scaffold, should he be asleep. The\r\nsturgeon-fisheries of the Volga are thus admirably organized. Gmelin\r\ndescribes with some minuteness the sturgeon-fishing, during the winter,\r\nin the caverns and hollows of the river-banks near Astrakhan, in the\r\nestuary of the Volga. A great number of fishermen are assembled there\r\nwith their boats. The flotilla approaches the retreats to which the\r\nfishes have betaken themselves, the nets are skilfully arranged all\r\nround them, and all at once the whole mass of fishermen join in a great\r\ncry, at which the frightened fishes rush from their concealment and\r\nthrow themselves into the nets spread for them.\r\n\r\nThe size of the fish, the nourishing properties of its flesh, its\r\nhealthy and agreeable taste, and the immense quantity of eggs produced,\r\nhave a wonderful power in exciting the commerce and industry of the\r\ninhabitants of these countries. In order to give some idea of the\r\nabundance of the eggs of the sturgeon, it is stated that the weight of\r\ntwo ovaries equalled nearly a third of the weight of the whole animal;\r\nin other words, these ovaries weighed nearly eight hundred pounds in a\r\nfemale whose weight was two thousand eight hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nIt is with these eggs chiefly, but not altogether, that caviare is\r\nprepared; and the article is more or less relished according to the\r\nstate of the eggs. The display of caviare, as exhibited at the Universal\r\nExposition of Paris during the year 1867, will remain to those who have\r\nvisited it one of the most lasting recollections.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The exceptions to these are the Doras, or flat-headed\r\nHassar of India, which marches overland in large droves; the Swampines\r\nof Carolina (_Hydrargyra_); and the Perca Scandens, which in Tranquebar\r\nnot merely walks over level ground, but climbs trees.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Some fish, as the _Chondropterygii_, have no swimming\r\nbladder.--ED.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Dr. Fripp's theory of the properties of the fish's eye is\r\nvery plausible.\r\n\r\n1st. That the fish's eye in its normal state is arranged for the vision\r\nof near objects, and that the great refractive power of a prolate\r\nspheroid lens, such as exists in the fish, is adequate to the production\r\nof a picture at short focal distances, even with rays of light passing\r\nthrough so dense a medium as water.\r\n\r\n2nd. That there is no accommodation of the fish's eye for extended\r\nlimits of vision.\r\n\r\n3rd. That the passive state of the fish's eye, being that in which it is\r\nenabled to see objects near and at moderate distance, no active or\r\nphysiological change for accommodation of sight for distant objects\r\ntakes place or seems necessary.\r\n\r\nThe dioptric arrangement, being the reverse of that which obtains in\r\nanimals where \"accommodation\" is observed, and in whom the _passive\r\nstate_ is that of vision, arranged for distant objects, while the\r\n_active state_ is that of vision accommodated at will for near objects.\r\n\r\n4th. That the vascular distribution of the choroid vessels has no\r\nrelation to any movement of the lens or change of its shape, but is\r\narranged to meet the changes of static condition of the circulating\r\nfluid, and of dynamic force exerted by the heart under varying pressure\r\nfrom without; and that by such an arrangement, protection to the\r\ndelicate tissues of the eye is afforded by a compensating balance\r\nbetween the tension of the blood within the vessels and the external\r\npressure exerted upon them.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXVI.--Sturgeon Fishing on the Volga.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nOSSEI, OR BONY FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this denomination is comprehended many of the fishes which are\r\nmost familiar to us. They are characterized, as we have said elsewhere,\r\nas a group of animals having a solid skeleton. They are divided into six\r\norders; founded, however, it is necessary to add, on characteristics of\r\nlittle organic importance, and the names bestowed upon them are of a\r\nmost barbarous description. These names are, I. _Plectognathi_, namely,\r\nfishes in which the upper jaw is attached to the cranium, from\r\nπλεκτὸς, _interlaced_, and γνάθος, _jaw_.\r\n\r\nAfterwards those in which the upper jaw is movable, and the gills\r\narranged in circles, like rounded hoops. These are, II. the\r\n_Lophobranchii_, from λὀφυς, _crested_, or aigrette, and\r\nβρἀνχια, _gill_.\r\n\r\nIn the other orders the gills are arranged in a comb-like form. These\r\nare divided into two great groups. In the first, the rays of the fins\r\nare soft, except occasionally the first of dorsal or pectoral fins.\r\nThese are, III. the _Malacopterygians_, from μαλακὸς, _soft_, and\r\nπτερύγιον, _finned_--the third group of osseous fishes. In a\r\nlater group the fish have bony rays to the anterior dorsal fins, some\r\nosseous rays, and the anal fin and generally one of the ventral fins.\r\nThese are, IV. the _Acanthopterygians_, from ἂκανθα, _spiny_, and\r\nπτερύγιομ, _finned_, which form the last group of bony fishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PLECTOGNATHI.\r\n\r\nFrom their organization the fishes of this order establish the passage\r\nfrom _cartilaginous_ to the _osseous_ fishes. Their skeleton, which\r\nremains for some time more or less soft, becomes finally hard. The\r\nchief characteristic of the order is that the maxillary is firmly\r\nattached to the side of the inter-maxillary bone which forms the jaw,\r\nand the arch of the palate is united to the skull in such a manner as to\r\nbe motionless. The operculum and rays of the gills are hidden under a\r\nthick skin, which leaves externally only a small branchial slit. These\r\nfishes have no true ventral fin, and have only vestiges of side fins.\r\n\r\nThis order comprehends two natural families characterized by the\r\narmature of their jaws. They are the _Gymnodonta_ and the\r\n_Sclerodermata_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 357. The Globe-fish (Orthagoriscus), and Sun-fish\r\n(Tetrodon).]\r\n\r\nIn the family of _Gymnodonta_ the jaws have no apparent teeth, but they\r\nare furnished with a species of beak in ivory, which represents them.\r\nThe Sun-fish, _Tetrodon_ (Fig. 357), belong to the family.\r\n\r\nThe Globe-fish are so named from their large head and bony salient jaws,\r\nwhich are each divided in front by a sort of vertical slit in two\r\nportions, which simulate two teeth. These four portions of bony jaw,\r\nwhich project beyond the lips, somewhat resemble the hard and dentate\r\njaws of the turtle. Their anterior part is sometimes prolonged, like\r\nthe mandibles of the beak of the parrot. They are perfectly arranged to\r\ncrush the shells of the molluscs, as well as the resisting envelope of\r\nthe crustaceans on which they feed. The skin of these fishes bristles\r\nwith small slightly-projecting spines, the number of which compensate\r\nfor their brevity, which repel their enemies, and even wound the hand\r\nthat would grasp them. They enjoy, besides, a singular faculty; they can\r\ninflate the lower part of their body, and give it an extension so\r\nconsiderable that it becomes like an inflated ball, in which the real\r\nshape of the animal is lost. This result is obtained by the introduction\r\nof an immense quantity of air into the stomach when it wishes to ascend\r\nto the surface. The species of globe-fish are numerous. Some of them are\r\ncommon in the Nile, where they are frequently left ashore during the\r\nannual inundations.\r\n\r\nThe Globe-fish (_Orthagoriscus mola_), in the upper part of the\r\nengraving, is easily distinguished from the _Tetrodons_ by its\r\ncompressed spineless body; being very round in its vertical contour, it\r\nhas been compared to a disk, and more poetically to the moon--whence its\r\npopular names--to the great circular surface of which the dazzling\r\nsilvery white disk bears some resemblance. But it is especially during\r\nthe night that it justifies the name given to it. Then it shines\r\nbrightly, from its own phosphorescent light, at a little distance\r\nbeneath the surface. On very dark nights the globe-fish is sometimes\r\nseen swimming in the soft light which emanates from its body, the rays\r\nrendered undulating by the rippling of the water which it traverses, so\r\nas to resemble the trembling light of the moon half-veiled in misty\r\nvapours. When many of these fishes rove about together, mingling their\r\nsilvery trains, the scene suggests the idea of dancing stars. The\r\nmoon-fish is common in the Mediterranean, and sometimes reaches the\r\nmarkets of Paris. It is about thirty inches in length, and its weight is\r\nconsiderable. Its flesh is fat and viscous, and by no means pleasant to\r\neat.\r\n\r\nThe _Diodons_ (Fig. 358) only differ from the globe-fish in the form of\r\ntheir bony jaws, each forming only one piece. They seem to have two\r\nteeth, whence their name, from δίς, _two_, ὀδοὺς, _teeth_.\r\nThey differ also in their spines, which are much larger than those\r\nof the globe-fish. These fishes may be said to be the hedgehogs and\r\nporcupines of the sea. Like the globe-fish, they can erect their spines\r\nand inflate their bodies.\r\n\r\nThey are numerous in species--_Diodon pilosus_, represented in Fig. 358,\r\nbeing typical of the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 358. Diodon pilosus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 359. The File-fish (Balistes).]\r\n\r\nThe Sclerodermes are distinguished by their conical or pyramidal muzzle,\r\nterminating in a little mouth armed with true teeth; their skin is\r\ngenerally stiff and covered with hard scales. The File-fish, _Balistes_\r\nand _Coffers_, are selected for notice. The File or Rudder-fish (Fig.\r\n359) have the body compressed; the jaws are furnished with eight teeth,\r\narranged in a single row on each jaw, and covered with true lips; the\r\neyes are nearly level with the skin; the mouth is small, and the body\r\nenveloped in very hard scales, which are connected in groups and\r\ndistributed into compartments more or less regular, and strongly\r\nconnected by means of a thick skin. The animal is thus protected by a\r\nsort of cuirass and casque very difficult to penetrate.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of one species, the Balistes are inhabitants of\r\nTropical seas. They are generally brilliantly coloured; they herd\r\ntogether in great numbers, and in their gambols produce curious\r\ncombinations of brilliant colouring in the Equatorial seas. Their flesh\r\nis held in slight estimation, and at certain periods of the year is even\r\nsaid to be dangerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 360. The Coffer, or Ostracion.]\r\n\r\nThe Coffers, or Ostracions (Fig. 360), are without scales, but covered\r\nwith regular osseous compartments, which are so jointed the one to the\r\nother that the body is, as it were, enclosed in a kind of box or long\r\ncoffer, which only reveals the external organs of locomotion--namely,\r\nthe fins and a portion of tail. In some the body is triangular, in\r\nothers quadrangular, with or without spines.\r\n\r\nThese singular fishes are found in the Indian Ocean and in the American\r\nseas. They are of moderate size, and are much prized in the United\r\nStates as food.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LOPHOBRANCHII.\r\n\r\nThe Lophobranchii comprehend a few types, but are numerous in species.\r\nHere the gills are divided into small round tufts, and arranged in pairs\r\nalong the branchial arches; a structure quite peculiar, of which we have\r\nno examples in any other fishes. These gills are enclosed under a large\r\ncover, or operculum, attached on all sides by a membrane, which leaves\r\nonly a small hole for the escape of water which has served the purposes\r\nof respiration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 361. The Trumpet Pipe-fish (Syngnathus).]\r\n\r\nThese little cuirassed fishes consist of two genera, _Syngnathus_ and\r\n_Hippocampus_. The Syngnathes, or pipe-fishes, possess a very curious\r\norganic peculiarity. Their bodies are long, slender, and slightly\r\ntapering, covered with plates set lengthwise, without ventrals; the\r\nskin, in swelling, forms under the belly or under the tail, according to\r\nthe species, a pouch into which the eggs glide to be hatched, and which\r\nis afterwards a shelter for the young. Most of the species are strangers\r\nto European seas, but some few are found in the Channel. The Trumpet\r\nPipe-fish (Fig. 361) has the head small, the muzzle long, nearly\r\ncylindrical, slightly raised at the end, and terminating in a very small\r\nmouth without teeth. The animal is about twenty inches long; its skin is\r\nof a yellowish colour varied with brown. It lives in the Atlantic and\r\nMediterranean, where it is largely used by the fishermen in baiting\r\ntheir hooks. It is found in great abundance in the Atlantic between the\r\nEquator and the Western Isles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 362. The Sea-horse (Hippocampus).]\r\n\r\nThe Sea Horse (_Hippocampus_) is a small creature about the size of the\r\nengraving (Fig. 362); its head has a singular resemblance to that of the\r\nhorse. The rings which constitute the integument of the body and tail\r\nhave a close resemblance to the rings of some caterpillars. This curious\r\ncombination of forms originated the name, Hippocampus, from ἵππος,\r\n_horse_, κάμπος, _fish_, adopted in very ancient times to designate\r\nthis creature. It is found in the Atlantic, round the coast of Spain, the\r\nsouth of France, in the Mediterranean, and in the Indian Ocean. Mr.\r\nLukis, who raised two females in captivity, describes their habits as\r\nfollows:--\"When they swim,\" he says, \"they preserve a vertical position,\r\nbut their tail seems on the alert to seize whatever it meets with in the\r\nwater, clasping the stem of the rushes. Once fixed, the animal seems to\r\nwatch attentively all the surrounding objects, and darts on any prey\r\npresenting itself with great dexterity. When one of them approaches the\r\nother, they interlace their two tails, and it is only after a struggle\r\nthat they can separate again, attaching themselves by the lower part of\r\nthe chin to some rush in order to release themselves. They have\r\nrecourse to the same manœuvre when they wish to raise the body, or when\r\nthey wish to wind their tail to some new object. Their two eyes seem to\r\nmove independently of each other, like those of the chameleon. The iris\r\nis bright and edged with blue.\"\r\n\r\nThe sea-horses have the pectoral fins so formed as easily to sustain the\r\nbody, not only in the water, but even in the air; they are, in fact,\r\nwinged fishes, and probably originated the famous winged courser of\r\nmythology, after which they are sometimes named. They rarely exceed four\r\ninches in length; the body is covered with triangular scales, commonly\r\nof a bluish colour. They live on worms, fishes' eggs, and fragments of\r\norganic substances which they find in the far land at the bottom of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. MALACOPTERYGII.\r\n\r\nThe principal character of the fishes of this order is that the rays of\r\nthe fins are soft, except sometimes the first ray of the dorsal or\r\npectorals. They inhabit either sea or fresh water, and include fishes of\r\nthe utmost importance as human food, such as the herring, the cod, the\r\nsalmon, carp, pike, and many others. Modern naturalists, following\r\nCuvier, subdivide them into three orders:--1. _Apoda_, without ventrals;\r\n2. _Sub-branchiati_, ventrals under the pectorals; 3. _Abdominales_,\r\nhaving ventrals behind the pectorals.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. APODA.\r\n\r\nA single family composes this order, which comprehends great numbers\r\nboth in genera and species; they are anguilliform or snake-like,\r\nelongated in form, the skin thick and soft, and have no ventral fins. In\r\nthis order are included the _Ammodytes_, _Gymnotes_, _Murænas_, and\r\n_Anguilla_, or eels.\r\n\r\nThe Ammodytes have the body elongated and serpent-like, having a\r\ncontinuous fin extending along the greater part of the back, with\r\nanother at the opposite side, and a third or forked fin at the end of\r\nthe tail. The muzzle is also long; the lower jaw longer than the upper.\r\n_A. lancea_ (Fig. 363) buries itself in the sand; hence it is called the\r\nsand-eel; it hollows out a burrow for itself in the sand with its muzzle\r\nto the depth of fifteen or twenty inches, where it hunts out worms, on\r\nwhich it feeds, while it shelters itself from the jaws of many voracious\r\nfishes, which eagerly pursue it for its delicate flesh. In appearance\r\nthe _Ammodytes lancea_ is silvery blue, brighter on the lower parts than\r\non the upper, the radiating fins on the abdomen being alternately white\r\nand bluish in colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 363. The Lance (A. lancea).]\r\n\r\nThe gymnotes are long, nearly cylindrical, and also serpent-like, the\r\ntail being long in comparison to the other parts of the body. Beneath\r\nthe tail is a long swimming fin, the only locomotive organ, and it is\r\nthis nakedness of the back which confers its designation of γυμνὸς,\r\n_naked_, νῶτος, _back_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 364. The Gymnotus Electricus, or Electrical Eel.]\r\n\r\nThe Gymnotes are fresh-water fishes of South America, where they attain\r\na great size. There are several species, but the most remarkable, from\r\nits singular physical properties, is the Electrical Eel, _Gymnotus\r\nelectricus_ (Fig. 364). These properties enable the gymnotus to arrest\r\nsuddenly the pursuit of an enemy, or the flight of its prey, to suspend\r\non the instant every movement of its victim, and subdue it by an\r\ninvisible power. Even the fishermen themselves are suddenly struck and\r\nrendered torpid at the moment of seizing it, while nothing external\r\nbetrays the mysterious power possessed by the animal.\r\n\r\nThe electrical properties of the gymnotus were reported for the first\r\ntime by Van Berkal. The astronomer Richer, who had been sent to Cayenne\r\nin 1671 by the Academy of Sciences of Paris, on the Geodesic Survey,\r\nfirst made known the singular properties of the American fish. \"I was\r\nmuch astonished,\" says this author, \"to see a fish some three or four\r\nfeet in length, and resembling an eel, deprive of all sensation for a\r\nquarter of an hour the arm and neighbouring parts which touched it. I\r\nwas not only an ocular witness of the effect produced by its touch; but\r\nI have myself felt it, on touching one of these fishes still living,\r\nthough wounded by a hook, by means of which some Indians had drawn it\r\nfrom the water. They could not tell what it was called; but they assured\r\nme that it struck other fishes with its tail in order to stupefy them\r\nand devour them afterwards, which is very probable when we consider the\r\neffect of its touch upon a man.\"\r\n\r\nThe observations of Richer made little impression at the time on the\r\n_savants_ of Paris, and matters remained in this state for seventy\r\nyears, when the traveller Condamine spoke in his \"Voyage en Amérique\" of\r\na fish which produced the effects described by Richer. In 1750 a\r\nphysician named Ingram furnished some new views respecting this fish,\r\nwhich he thought was surrounded by an electric atmosphere. In 1755\r\nanother physician, the Dutch Dr. Gramund, writes: \"The effect produced\r\nby this fish corresponds exactly with that produced by the Leyden jar,\r\nwith this difference, that we see no tinsel on its body, however strong\r\nthe blow it gives; for if the fish is large, those who touch it are\r\nstruck down, and feel the blow on their whole body.\"\r\n\r\nMany experiments followed these; but we are indebted to Alexander von\r\nHumboldt for the first precise account of this very curious fish. The\r\ncelebrated naturalist read to the Institute of France an important\r\nmemoir upon the electrical eel from Bonpland's observations, the\r\nsubstance of which we shall give here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXVII.--Fishing for Eel (Gymnotus) on the\r\nOrinoco.]\r\n\r\nIn traversing the Llanas of the province of Caracas, in order to embark\r\nat San Fernando de Apure on his voyage up the Orinoco, M. Bonpland\r\nstopped at Calabozo. The object of this sojourn was to investigate the\r\nhistory of the gymnotus, great numbers of which are found in the\r\nneighbourhood. After three days' residence in Calabozo some Indians\r\nconducted them to the Cano de Bera, a muddy and stagnant basin, but\r\nsurrounded by rich vegetation, in which _Clusia rosea_, _Hymenoea\r\ncourbaril_, some grand Indian figs, and some magnificent flowering\r\nodoriferous mimosas, were pre-eminent. They were much surprised when\r\ninformed that it would be necessary to take thirty half-wild horses from\r\nthe neighbouring savannahs in order to fish for the gymnotus.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this fishing, called in the language of the country\r\n_embarbascar con caballos_ (intoxicating by means of horses), is very\r\nodd. The word _barbasco_ indicates the roots of the _Lacquinia_, or any\r\nother poisonous plant, by contact of which a body of water acquires the\r\nproperty of killing, or, at least, of intoxicating or stupefying the\r\nfishes. These come to the surface when they have been poisoned in this\r\nmanner. The horses chasing them here and there in a marsh has, it seems,\r\nthe same effect upon the alarmed fishes. While our hosts were explaining\r\nto us this strange mode of fishing, the troop of horses and mules had\r\narrived, and the Indians had made a sort of battue, pressing the horses\r\non all sides, and forcing them into the marsh. The Indians, armed with\r\nlong canes and harpoons, placed themselves round the basin, some of them\r\nmounting the trees, whose branches hung over the water, and by their\r\ncries, and still more by their canes, preventing the horses from landing\r\nagain. The eels, stunned by the noise, defended themselves by repeated\r\ndischarges of their batteries. For a long time it seemed as if they\r\nwould be victorious over the horses. Some of the mules especially, being\r\nalmost stifled by the frequency and force of the shock, disappeared\r\nunder the water, and some of the horses, in spite of the watchfulness of\r\nthe Indians, regained the bank, where, overcome by the shocks they had\r\nundergone, they stretched themselves at their whole length. The picture\r\npresented was now indescribable. Groups of Indians surrounded the basin;\r\nthe horses with bristling mane, terror and grief in their eyes, trying\r\nto escape from the storm which had surprised them; the eels, yellow and\r\nlivid, looking like great aquatic serpents swimming on the surface of\r\nthe water, and chasing their enemies, were objects at once appalling and\r\npicturesque. In less than five minutes two horses were drowned. An eel,\r\nmore than five feet long, glided under one horse, discharged its\r\napparatus through its whole extent, attacking at once the heart, the\r\nviscera, and the plexus of the nerves of the animal, probably benumbing\r\nand finally drowning it.\r\n\r\nWhen the struggle had endured a quarter of an hour, the mules and horses\r\nappeared less frightened, the manes became more erect, the eyes\r\nexpressed less terror, the eels shunned in place of attacking them, at\r\nthe same time approaching the bank, when they were easily taken by\r\nthrowing little harpoons at them attached to long cords, the harpoon,\r\nsometimes hooking two at a time, being landed by means of the long cord.\r\nThey were drawn ashore without being able to communicate any shock.\r\n\r\nHaving landed the eels, they were transported to little pools dug in the\r\nsoil, and filled with fresh water; but such is the terror they inspire,\r\nthat none of the people of the country would release them from the\r\nharpoon--a task which the travellers had to perform themselves, and\r\nreceive the first shock, which was not slight--the most energetic\r\nsurpassing in force that communicated by a Leyden jar completely\r\ncharged. The gymnotus surpasses in size and strength all the other\r\nelectric fishes. Humboldt saw them five feet three inches long. They\r\nvary in colour according to age, and the nature of the muddy water in\r\nwhich they live. Beneath, the head is of a fine yellow colour mixed with\r\nred; the mouth is large, and furnished with small teeth arranged in many\r\nrows.\r\n\r\nThe gymnotus makes its shock felt in any part of its body which is\r\ntouched, but the excitement is greater when touched under the belly, and\r\nin the pectoral fin. The gymnotus gives the most frightful shocks\r\nwithout the least muscular movement in the fins, in the head, or any\r\nother part of the body. The shock, indeed, depends upon the will of the\r\nanimal, and in this respect differs from a Leyden jar, which is\r\ndischarged by communicating with two opposite poles. It happens\r\nsometimes that a gymnotus, seriously wounded, only gives a very weak\r\nshock, but if, thinking it exhausted, it is touched fearlessly and at\r\nonce, its discharge is terrible. Indeed, the phenomena depend so much\r\nupon the will of the animal, that, according to Von Humboldt, if it is\r\ntouched by two metallic rods, the shock is communicated sometimes by\r\none, sometimes by the other wand, though their extremities are close\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe experiments already related in connection with the torpedo were\r\nrepeated here. If we place ourselves upon an isolated support, and take\r\nhold of a metallic rod, a shock is received; but no shock is received,\r\non the other hand, if the fish is touched with a glass rod, or one\r\ncovered with wax. Humboldt and Bonpland repeated this experiment many\r\ntimes, with decisive results. The electric organ has been carefully\r\ndescribed by these observers. The organs extend from under the tail,\r\noccupying nearly one-half of the thickness. It is divided into four\r\nlongitudinal bundles of muscles, the upper ones large, the two smaller\r\nbelow, and against the base of the anal fin. Each bundle consists of\r\nmany parallel membranous plates, placed closely together and very nearly\r\nhorizontal. These plates abut in one part on the skin, in another, on\r\nthe mean vertical plane of the fish. They are united to each other by an\r\ninfinity of smaller plates, placed either vertically or transversely.\r\nThe smaller prismatic and transversal canal, intercepted by these two\r\norders of plates, are filled with gelatinous matter. All this organic\r\napparatus receives many nerves, and presents, in many respects, an\r\narrangement nearly analogous to that of the torpedoes.\r\n\r\nThe Sea-Eels (_Muræna Helena_) are serpent-like fishes, of cylindrical\r\nform and delicate proportions, but strong, flexible, and active,\r\nswimming in waving, undulating movements in the water, just as a serpent\r\ncreeps on dry land. The murænas have no pectoral fin; the dorsal and\r\nanal fin are reunited in the tail fin. A branchial opening is observable\r\non each side of the body. The sea-eels are numerous in species. _Muræna\r\nHelena_ (Fig. 365), which is an inhabitant of the Mediterranean, has\r\nonly a single row of teeth upon each jaw. It attains the length of forty\r\nto fifty inches. It loves to bask in the hollows of rocks, approaching\r\nthe coast in spring-time. It feeds on crabs and small fishes, seeking\r\neagerly for polyps. The voracity of these fishes is such that when other\r\nfood fails they begin to nibble at each other's tails.\r\n\r\nThe sea-eels are caught with rod and line, or by lines and ground-bait,\r\nbut their instinct is such that they often escape. When they have\r\nswallowed a hook they often cut the line with their teeth, or they turn\r\nupon it and try, by winding it round some object, to strain or break\r\nit. When caught in a net, they quickly choose some mesh through which\r\ntheir body can glide.\r\n\r\nThose who have studied the classics will remember the passionate love\r\nwith which the Roman gourmet regarded these fishes. In the days of the\r\nEmpire enormous sums were expended in keeping up the ponds which\r\nenclosed them, and the fish themselves were multiplied to such an extent\r\nthat Cæsar, on the occasion of one of his triumphs, distributed six\r\nthousand among his friends. Licinius Crassus was celebrated among\r\nwealthy Romans for the splendour of his eel-ponds. They obeyed his\r\nvoice, he said, and when he called them they darted towards him in order\r\nto be fed by his hands. The same Licinius Crassus, and Quintus\r\nHortensius, another wealthy Roman patrician, wept the loss of their\r\nmurænas on one occasion, when they all died in their ponds from some\r\ndisease. This, however, was only a matter of taste, passion, or fashion;\r\nsometimes, however, accompanied by cruelty and gross corruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 365. The Sea-Eel (Muræna Helena).]\r\n\r\nIt was thought among the Romans that murænas fed with human flesh were\r\nthe most delicately flavoured. A rich freedman, named Pollion, who must\r\nnot, however, be confounded with the orator of the name, had the cruelty\r\nto order such of his slaves as he thought deserving of death, and\r\nsometimes even those who had done nothing to excite his anger, to be\r\nthrown to them. On one occasion, when he entertained the Emperor\r\nAugustus, a poor slave who attended had the misfortune to break a\r\nprecious vase; Pollion immediately ordered him to be thrown to the eels.\r\nBut the indignant emperor gave the slave his freedom, and, in order to\r\nmanifest his indignation with Pollion, he ordered his attendants to\r\nbreak every vase of value which the freedman had collected in his\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\nIn the present day sea-eels are little esteemed in a gastronomic point\r\nof view. Nevertheless they are still sought for on the coast of Italy,\r\nand the fishermen avoid with great care the bites of their sharp teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 366. The Common Conger (Conger vulgaris).]\r\n\r\nThe Eels (_Anguilla_) have pectoral fins, under which are the\r\ngill-openings on each side; the dorsal and anal fins extending up to the\r\ntail, mingling with this last, which terminates in a point at the\r\nextremity. The eels are divided into two groups: 1. The Eels\r\n(_Anguilla_), properly so called; and, 2. The _Congers_. The first\r\ninhabit most European rivers, except in the spawning season, when,\r\naccording to some naturalists, they betake themselves to the sea. During\r\nthe greater part of their existence, therefore, they have no connection\r\nwith the ocean. The _Congers_, on the other hand, are fishes of great\r\nsize, which inhabit the seas of warm countries, as well as those of\r\nNorthern Europe. The type of this family is the Common Conger, _Conger\r\nvulgaris_ (Fig. 366), which differs from the true eels chiefly in the\r\ndorsal fins, which commence very near to the pectorals; and also in\r\ntheir upper jaw being longer than their under one. They attain the\r\nthickness of a man's leg, and are sometimes two yards in length. The\r\nconger-eel is frequently found in salt marshes, but its flesh is held in\r\nlittle esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SUB-BRANCHIATI.\r\n\r\nThe fishes of this order are characterised by vertical fins being\r\nattached under the pectorals, and immediately suspended to the shoulder\r\nbone. Exclusively marine fishes, they inhabit every region of the globe.\r\nThe order comprehends three families:--I. _Discobolidæ_; II.\r\n_Pleuronectidæ_, or flat fishes; III. the _Gadidæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. DISCOBOLIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe family of Discobolidæ consists of a small number of species\r\ncharacterised by their ventral fins being discoform, as in the\r\nsea-snails (_Liparis_), in which the lengthened mucous body is without\r\nscales, but with one long dorsal fin; the pectoral and ventrals forming\r\none disk, as in Fig. 367, or the Suckers (_Lepidogaster_), where the\r\npectorals and ventrals form two disks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 367. The Sea-Snail (Liparis).]\r\n\r\nIn the Lump-fish, _Cyclopteris_ (Fig. 368), the disk formed by the\r\nventrals forms a sort of sucker, by which the fish attaches itself to\r\nthe rocks; while the _Echineis_ is remarkable for the disk-like sucker\r\nwith which it is provided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 368. The Lump-fish (Cyclopteus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 369. Echineis remora.]\r\n\r\nThe _Echineis remora_ is an inhabitant of the Mediterranean, and abounds\r\nin the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. It is furnished with a flat disk,\r\nwhich covers its head, as represented in Fig. 369, which is formed of a\r\nnumber of transverse and movable cartilaginous plates. Aided by this\r\norgan, it attaches itself firmly to rocks, and even to ships and larger\r\nfishes, such as the Dog-fish (_Acanthius_), which it meets with in its\r\nwanderings. Its adhesion to those objects is so strong that the strength\r\nof a man fails to separate them. It invariably attaches itself to the\r\ndorsum and flank of the shark, and sometimes weighs a pound and a\r\nquarter. \"I have found,\" writes a friend, \"as many as seven on one\r\nshark.\" It is never solitary, and makes long voyages on this monstrous\r\nanimal locomotive, and that without fatigue or danger, for its enemies\r\nare kept at a distance by the formidable monster which carries it.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. PLEURONECTIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe Flat-fishes (_Pleuronectidæ_) have the body flat and greatly\r\ncompressed, but in a direction different from that of the _Raias_ and\r\nother analogous beings. In the case of the Raia the body is flattened\r\nhorizontally, while in the Pleuronectidæ they are compressed laterally.\r\nThe head of fishes of this order is not symmetrical; the two eyes are\r\nplaced on the same side; the two sides of the mouth are unequal.\r\n\r\nTo these peculiarities of structure we shall return when we come to\r\nobserve the several types more clearly. In inaction, as in motion, the\r\nflat-fishes are always turned upon their side, and the side turned\r\ntowards the bottom of the sea is that which has no eye. This habit of\r\nswimming on their side is that to which they owe their name of\r\nπλευρὰ, side, and νέχτος, swimmers.\r\n\r\nTheir chief organ of natation is the caudal fin, but they are\r\ndistinguished from all other fishes by the manner in which they use this\r\noar. When turned upon their side this organ is not horizontal, but\r\nvertical, and strikes the water vertically up and down. They advance\r\nthrough the water but very slowly, compared to the motion of other\r\nfishes. They ascend or descend in the water with greater promptitude,\r\nbut they cannot turn to the right or left with the same facility as\r\nother fishes. This property of rising or sinking in the water with\r\nfacility is the more useful to them, inasmuch as the greater part of\r\ntheir existence is passed at the greatest depths, where they draw\r\nthemselves along the sands at the bottom of the sea, and often hide\r\nthemselves from their enemies. Among the _Pleuronectidæ_, soles, turbot,\r\nflounders, and plaice may be noted.\r\n\r\nSoles (_Solea_) have the body oblong, the side opposite to the edges\r\ngenerally furnished with shaggy, soft hairs; the muzzles round, nearly\r\nalways in advance of the mouth, which is twisted to the left side, and\r\nfurnished with teeth on one side only, while the eyes are on the right\r\nside. The dorsal fin commences about the mouth, and extends up to the\r\ncaudal or terminal fin. The Common Sole, _Solea vulgaris_ (Fig. 370), is\r\nplentiful in the Channel, along the Atlantic coasts, and especially in\r\nthe Mediterranean. It is brown on the right, and whitish on the opposite\r\nside. Its pectoral fins are spotted black; the scales rugged and\r\ndenticulate; its size seems to vary according to the coast it frequents.\r\nOff the mouth of the Seine soles are sometimes taken eighteen and twenty\r\ninches in length. There are several modes of taking them, but for\r\ncommercial purposes it is taken by the trawl-net. When the ground-hook\r\nis employed it is baited with fragments of small fish. Every one knows\r\nthe delicate flavour of the flesh of the sole, which, however, varies\r\ngreatly in different localities, those of the Channel Islands being\r\nparticularly choice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 370. The Common Sole (Solea vulgaris).]\r\n\r\nThe Turbot, _Rhombus maximus_ (Fig. 371), resembles in its general form\r\na lozenge, whence its name of _rhombus_. Its under jaw is more advanced\r\nthan the upper jaw, and is furnished with many rows of small teeth. Its\r\nfins are yellow, with brownish spots. The left side is marbled brown\r\nand yellow; the right side, which is the inferior, white with brownish\r\nspots and points. The true turbot is the special delight of the epicure,\r\nand fabulous sums are said to have been given at different times by rich\r\npersons in order to secure a fine turbot. The fish used to be taken\r\nlargely on our own coasts, but now we have to rely upon more distant\r\nfishing-grounds for a large portion of our supply--large quantities\r\ncoming from Holland. The turbot spawns during the autumn, and is in fine\r\ncondition during spring and early summer. Mr. Yarrell says that it\r\nspawns in spring. Dr. Bertram doubts this, although he is not quite sure\r\nof it, inasmuch as \"there will, no doubt, be individuals of the turbot\r\nkind, as there are of all other kinds of fish, that will spawn all the\r\nyear round.\" The turbot abounds on our west coast, round Torbay, and off\r\nthe mouth of the Seine and the Somme, from whence comes most of the fish\r\nconsumed in London and Paris. The flounders, plaice, and halibut form an\r\nimportant section of the Pleuronectidæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 371. The Turbot (Rhombus maximus).]\r\n\r\nThe Flounders and Plaice (_Platessa_) inhabit the northern seas of\r\nEurope. They have their eyes placed on the right side; the dorsal as\r\nwell as the anal fin extending from over the eyes to the caudal, both\r\nstretching out to a point towards the centre, giving a rhombic form to\r\nthe fish. In _Platessa_ the jaws are furnished with a single row of\r\nobtuse teeth.\r\n\r\nThe Common Plaice, _P. vulgaris_ (Fig. 372), attains the length of ten\r\nor twelve inches; it is brown above, spotted with red or orange. On the\r\neye-side of the head are some osseous tubercles. The body, which is\r\nsomewhat lozenge-shaped, is smooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 372. The Common Plaice (Platessa vulgaris).]\r\n\r\nThe Flounders (_P. flesus_) are fresh-water fishes of small size,\r\nabundant in the Thames and many other rivers; they are only second in\r\nimportance to the soles and turbot among the Pleuronectidæ; the numbers\r\nof brill, flounders, dab, and plaice required being close upon a hundred\r\nmillion for the supply of London alone.\r\n\r\nThe usual mode of capturing flat-fish is by means of a trawl-net, but\r\nmany varieties of these may be caught with a hand-line. \"A day's\r\nsea-fishing,\" says Dr. Bertram, in his \"Harvest of the Sea,\" \"will be\r\nchequered by many little adventures. There are various minor monsters of\r\nthe deep that will vary the monotony of the day by occasionally\r\ndevouring the bait. A tadpole fish, better known as the sea-devil, or\r\nangler, may be hooked; or a visit from a hammer-headed shark, or a\r\npile-fish, will add greatly to the excitement; and if the 'dogs' should\r\nbe at all plentiful, it is a chance if a single fish be got out of the\r\nsea in its integrity. So voracious are these Squalidæ, that I have often\r\nenough pulled a mere skeleton into the boat, instead of a plump cod of\r\nten or twelve pounds weight.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dab, _P. limanda_ (Fig. 373), is very common in the markets of\r\nParis, where it is held in great esteem. It takes its name Limanda from\r\nthe hard and dentate scales on its body. The Platessa have the jaws\r\nfurnished with a single row of obtuse teeth; the dorsal fin only extends\r\nin front to a line with the eye, leaving an interval between it and the\r\ncaudal. The form of the body is rhomboidal, as in the turbot, and the\r\neyes are usually on the right side. The flounder, the plaice, and the\r\ndab, are all examples of this group of fishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 373. The Dab (Platessa limanda).]\r\n\r\nThe Halibut, _Hippoglossus vulgaris_ (Fig. 374), is a large fish,\r\ninhabiting the seas of Northern Europe and Greenland, where it is\r\noccasionally caught measuring seven feet, and weighing from three to\r\nfour hundred pounds. A fish of this species was brought to Edinburgh\r\nmarket in April, 1828, measuring seven feet and a half in length and\r\nthree feet broad, weighing three hundred and twenty pounds. The body of\r\nthe halibut is more elongated than that of the plaice or flounder, the\r\njaws and pharyngeans being armed with strong and pointed teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXVVIII.--Natives fishing for Halibut on the\r\nGreenland Coast.]\r\n\r\nGreat quantities of this fish are caught on the Greenland and Norway\r\ncoasts, and other northern regions. According to Lacepede, the\r\nnatives fish for this with an implement which they call _gangnaed_. It\r\nis composed of a hempen cord five or six hundred yards in length, to\r\nwhich are attached some thirty smaller cords, each furnished with a\r\nbarbed hook at its extremity. The larger cord is attached to floating\r\nplanks, which act as trimmers, indicating the place of this formidable\r\nengine of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe Greenlanders usually replace the hempen cords by thongs of whalebone\r\nor narrow bands of shark's skin. At the end of twenty hours these lines\r\nare drawn home, and it is not at all unusual to find five or six large\r\nhalibut caught on the hooks. PL. XXVIII. represents the native mode of\r\nfishing for halibut in the Greenland Seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 374. The Halibut (Hippoglossus vulgaris).]\r\n\r\nAnother mode of capturing this and other flat-fish is to spear them on\r\ntheir sandy beds. \"No rule can be laid down,\" says Dr. Bertram, \"for\r\nthis method of fishing. It is carried on successfully by means of a\r\ncommon pitchfork, but some gentlemen go the length of fine spears made\r\nfor the purpose, very long, and with very sharp prongs. Others, again,\r\nuse a three-pronged farmyard graip, which has been known to do as much\r\nreal work as more elaborate single points contrived for the purpose. The\r\nsimplest directions I can give is just to spear every fish they see.\" M.\r\nFiguier adds, as a caution, that before attacking these fishes, body to\r\nbody, it is necessary to wait till they are somewhat exhausted,\r\notherwise they might overturn both bark and fisherman.\r\n\r\nThe Greenlanders cut the animal up, and salt the pieces; then expose\r\nthem to the air, in order to dry them preparatory to a long voyage.\r\n\r\nIn its fresh state the halibut is not very delicate, and is hard and\r\ndifficult of digestion; however, its great size renders it a valuable\r\nprize. We may add that, notwithstanding its great size, the halibut has\r\ndeadly enemies in the dolphins, as well as in the birds which prey upon\r\nfishes on the shore. It is itself a voracious fish, devouring crabs,\r\ncod-fish, and even the _Raiadæ_, not even sparing its own species; they\r\nattack each other, nibbling at the tail or fins.\r\n\r\nIII. GADIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe Gadidæ embrace the whole of the Linnæan genus _Gadus_. They are\r\nfound mostly in the seas of cold or temperate regions in both\r\nhemispheres, and are the objects of pursuit for which the great\r\nfisheries of Europe and America are established. They are known by the\r\nposition of the ventral fin under the throat, and by the pointed\r\ncharacter of those fins. The body is long and slightly compressed; the\r\nhead well proportioned. Their fins are soft, and their scales are small\r\nand soft. The jaws and front of the _os vomer_ have unequal-pointed\r\nteeth of moderate size, and disposed in several rows. The gill-covers\r\nare large, and consist of seven rays. Most of the species have the\r\ndorsal fin, and contain two others besides--a fin behind the vent, and a\r\ndistant caudal fin. The stomach is large, and the intestine long. The\r\nair-bladder large and strong, and in some cases notched on the margin.\r\nThe flesh of most of the species yields white, healthy, and agreeable\r\nfood, easily separable into flakes when cooked, and easy of digestion.\r\nThe family includes the several genera:--MORRHUA, to which belongs the\r\nCommon Cod-fish, _M. callarias_; the Haddock, _M. æglefinus_.--The\r\nMERLANGUS, or Whiting, _M. vulgaris_, and _M. albus_; the Coal-fish, _M.\r\ncarbonarus_; and the Pollack, _M. pollachius_.--The MERLUCIUS, or\r\nHakes.--The LOTA, or Ling, _L. molva_.--MOTELLA, or Rock Ling, and\r\nSilver Gade, _M. argenteola_; and other genera of less importance.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Cod (_Morrhua callarias_) is compressed; the eyes placed\r\non the side, close to each other, and veiled by a transparent membrane,\r\na conformation which, according to Lacepede, enables the animal to swim\r\non the surface of the water in northern regions in the midst of\r\nmountains of ice and under banks covered with snow, without being\r\ndazzled by the brilliant light; but this opinion is unsupported by any\r\nother naturalist of note.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 375. The Cod-fish (Morrhua callarias).]\r\n\r\nThe jaws of the cod-fish are unequal, and among the rows of teeth with\r\nwhich it is armed many are mobile, and can be hidden in their cavities,\r\nor raised, according to the will of the animal. The dorsal fins, three\r\nin number, are in clusters, as in Fig. 375; anal fins are two; pectoral\r\nfins narrow, and terminating in a point; caudal fin slightly forked. Its\r\ncolour is of an ashy grey, spotted with yellow on the back; white and\r\nsometimes reddish beneath.\r\n\r\nThe cod-fish is provided with a vast stomach, and is very voracious,\r\nfeeding on fishes, crabs, and molluscs. It is so gluttonous and\r\nindiscriminating, that it will even swallow pieces of wood and other\r\nsimilar objects. This is essentially a sea-fish: it is never seen in\r\nfresh-water streams or rivers, remaining during the greater part of the\r\nyear in the depths of the sea. Its habitual sojourn is in the portion of\r\nthe Northern Ocean lying between the fortieth and sixty-sixth degrees of\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nIn the vast range thus frequented by the cod, two large spaces are\r\npointed out which it seems to prefer. The first extends to the coast of\r\nGreenland, and the other is limited by Iceland, Norway, the Danish\r\ncoast, Germany, Holland, and the east and north coast of Great Britain\r\nand the Orkney Isles, comprehending the Doggerbank, Vellbank, and Cromer\r\ncoast, together with salt-water lakes and arms of the sea, such as the\r\nGairloch, Portsoy, and the Moray Firth, which indent the west coast of\r\nScotland, and attract considerable shoals of cod-fish.\r\n\r\nThe second range, less generally known, but more celebrated among\r\nsailors, includes the coast of New England, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia,\r\nand, above all, the island of Newfoundland, on the south coast of which\r\nis the famous sand-bank called the _Great Bank_, having a length of\r\nnearly two hundred leagues, with a breadth of sixty-two, over which\r\nflows from ten to fifty fathoms of water. Here the cod-fish swarm, for\r\nhere they meet shoals of herrings and other animals, on which they feed.\r\nSuch is, according to Lacepede, the geographical distribution of the\r\ncod-fish.\r\n\r\nThe English, French, Dutch, and Americans give themselves up to the\r\ncod-fishery on the bank of Newfoundland with inconceivable ardour. This\r\nisland was discovered and visited by the Norwegians in the tenth and\r\neleventh centuries, long before the discovery of America; but it was\r\nonly in 1497, after the discoveries of Columbus, that the navigator,\r\nJohn Cabot, having visited these regions, gave it the name by which it\r\nhas since been known, and called attention to the swarms of cod-fish\r\nwhich inhabited the surrounding sea. Immediately after, the English and\r\nsome other nations hastened to reap these fruitful fields of living\r\nmatter. In 1578, France sent a hundred and fifty ships to the great\r\nbank, Spain a hundred and twenty-five, Portugal fifty, and England\r\nforty.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the eighteenth century, England and her\r\ncolonies, with the French, cultivated the cod-fishery.\r\n\r\nFrom 1823 to 1831 France sent three hundred and forty-one ships, with\r\nseven thousand six hundred and eighty-five men, which carried into port\r\nover fifty million pounds of fish, an average of about six millions\r\nannually. Two thousand English ships of various sizes, manned by thirty\r\nthousand seamen, are now employed in this important branch of industry.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Norway, from the frontiers of Russia to Cape Lindesnæs,\r\nthe cod-fishery is an important branch of trade, in which a maritime\r\npopulation of twenty thousand fishermen are employed, with five thousand\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nThe cod is taken either by net or line. The net is chiefly employed at\r\nNewfoundland. The net used is rectangular, and furnished with lead at\r\nthe lower edge, and cork buoys on the upper edge. One of the extremities\r\nis fixed on the coast; the other is carried seaward, following a curve\r\ntaken by the boats, and the fish are attracted by drawing upon both\r\nextremities of the net; and by one stroke many boat-loads are sometimes\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThe modern cod-smack is clipper-built, with large wells for carrying the\r\nfish alive, its cost being about £1500. The crew usually consists of ten\r\nto twelve men and boys, including the captain. The line is also used for\r\ntaking cod and haddocks. \"Each man,\" says Bertram, \"has a line of fifty\r\nfathoms in length, and attached to each of these lines are a hundred\r\n'snoods,' with hooks already baited with mussels, pieces of herring, or\r\nwhiting. Each line is laid 'clear,' in a shallow basket, and so arranged\r\nas to run freely as the boat shoots ahead. The fifty-fathom line with a\r\nhundred hooks is in Scotland called a 'taes.' If there are eight men in\r\na boat, the length of the line will be four hundred fathoms, with eight\r\nhundred hooks, the lines being tied to each other before setting. On\r\narriving at the fishing-ground, the fishermen heave overboard a cork\r\nbuoy, with a flagstaff about six feet in height attached to it. This\r\nbuoy is kept stationary by a line, called the 'pow end,' reaching to the\r\nbottom of the water, where it is held by a stone or a grapnel fastened\r\nto the lower end. To the 'pow end' is also fastened the fishing line,\r\nwhich is then paid out as fast as the boat sails, which may be from four\r\nto five knots an hour. Should the wind be unfavourable for the direction\r\nin which the crew wish to set the line, they use the oars. When the line\r\nor 'taes' is all out, the end is dropped and the boat returns to the\r\nbuoy. The 'pow' line is hauled up with the anchor and fishing line\r\nattached to it. The fishermen then haul in the line, with the fish\r\nattached to it. Eight hundred fish might be taken, and often have been,\r\nby eight men in a few hours by this operation; but many fishermen say\r\nnow, that they consider themselves fortunate when they get a fish on\r\nevery fifth hook on an eight-lined 'taes'-line.\"\r\n\r\nHungry cod-fish will seize almost any kind of bait, and this is used\r\neither fresh or salted. The fresh bait is furnished by the herring,\r\nwhiting, and capelan, a little fish which in the spring descends from\r\nthe North Sea in shoals, pursued by the cod-fish. In the terror caused\r\nby the innumerable bands of their enemies, the capelans spread\r\nthemselves in all the seas round Newfoundland in masses so thick that\r\nthe waves throw them ashore, and they accumulate occasionally in heaps\r\nupon the sandy beach.\r\n\r\nThe principal fishery for capelan intended for bait takes place on the\r\ncoast of Newfoundland. The inhabitants of these regions carry their\r\nbooty to the fishermen, who make Saint-Pierre their rendezvous, with\r\nwhom they find ready purchasers.\r\n\r\nThe schooners, with a fair provision of bait, leaving Saint-Pierre and\r\nother ports, take a north-easterly direction towards the great bank,\r\nand, having chosen their fishing-ground, cast anchor in fifty or sixty\r\nfathoms, and forthwith the crews give their sole attention to the lines;\r\nsome of them watch the lines, which are raised every instant, the\r\ncaptured fish removed, and the hooks re-baited; others subject the\r\ncaptured fishes to a first preparation for preserving them; they are\r\nopened, the entrails removed, and the fish split in two, and piled one\r\non the other, and covered with salt. This labour goes on as long as the\r\nfishing lasts. The sailor is on deck night and day, covered with oil and\r\nblood, and surrounded with all sorts of offal and fish-like smells. But\r\nthis alone is insufficient. Boats, manned by crews of two or three\r\nsailors, are continually moving about, attending to the more distant\r\nlines, or \"taes,\" which radiate round the ship in all directions.\r\n\r\nOne portion of the cod caught is despatched to Europe in a fresh state,\r\nwithout other preparation than the salting which they receive on the\r\ndeck of the schooner. But much the greater portion are carried on shore\r\nand subjected to further preparation. Saint-Pierre and Miquelon Islands,\r\nwhich are granted to the French fishermen on condition that no\r\nfortifications are erected on them, is resorted to for the purpose by\r\nthe French fleet; St. John's, the capital, by the English. The Comte de\r\nGobineau gives an animated picture of the whole process of curing the\r\ncod-fish in the \"Tour du Monde for 1863.\" \"The French houses which\r\npursue this branch of trade,\" he says, \"belong principally to the Ports\r\nof Granville and St. Breuc; and the crews of their ships consist of two\r\nvery distinct elements; the smaller portion, being specially raised\r\namong the fishermen properly so called, they form the aristocracy on\r\nboard; to these are added a larger number of mere labourers, who are\r\nlanded on the arrival of the vessel at her port. Their functions are\r\nlimited to receiving the fish from the boats, opening it, washing off\r\nthe glutinous matter in the _chauffant_, putting the liver apart, and\r\nlaying out the split fish between the layers of salt; finally,\r\nsubjecting it to the different phases of the drying process on the\r\nstrand.\r\n\r\n\"The _chauffant_ is a shed raised upon piles, standing one half in the\r\nwater and one half on shore; it is constructed of planks and posts,\r\nthrough which the air is suffered to circulate freely, but covered in\r\nwith some of the ship's sails. Here the process of separating the\r\nintestines from the body of the fish, and the salting process are\r\ncarried on, in the midst of an atmosphere charged with all manner of\r\ndisgusting smells, for the labourer is by no means delicate, and never\r\nthinks of removing the disgusting impurities which he is creating. There\r\nhe stands, knife in hand, tearing and cutting out intestines and\r\nseparating vertebræ, his only care being to avoid cutting himself, which\r\nis the chief danger he runs, in the midst of odours sufficient to\r\nproduce suffocation.\r\n\r\n\"Connected with the platform, on which this rough operation is performed\r\nis a cauldron, sunk in the earth, to receive the oil pressed out of the\r\nliver. This cauldron is surmounted by a roof some nine feet in height,\r\nin the form of an inverted cone. Here the oil which flows from the open\r\nway above is suffered to remain, after which it is drawn off into casks.\r\n\r\n\"The drying sheds, formerly of wood, are now constructed of stone, and\r\nin places well exposed to the sun, and especially to the wind,\r\nartificial or otherwise. The sun, it is said, does not dry, but\r\nscorches; the wind, on the other hand, marvellously fulfils the purpose,\r\nand in order to avoid the one and court the other, an apparatus has been\r\ninvented, consisting of long movable branches, which can be inclined so\r\nas to bring the wind directly upon the row of cod, in connection with\r\nthe sun's rays, which are, indeed, not very formidable in this foggy\r\nregion.\"\r\n\r\nThe cod-fish thus dried at Newfoundland are forwarded for consumption to\r\nall parts of the world; but only a small part of the products of the\r\nfishery are thus prepared. More than half the produce of the French\r\nfleet are sent to France merely salted, by ships which carry salt,\r\nbringing back fish in return to Rochelle, Bordeaux, and Cette, where the\r\nprocess of curing is completed. In our home fisheries, to abbreviate\r\nslightly Dr. Bertram's account, the greater part of the cod taken are\r\neaten fresh, but considerable quantities of the cod and ling taken on\r\nthe coast are sent to market cured. The process pursued is very simple:\r\nthey are brought on shore quite fresh, and are at once split from head\r\nto tail, and by copious washings thoroughly cleansed from all particles\r\nof blood; a piece of the backbone is cut away; they are drained, and\r\nafterwards laid down in long vats, where they are covered with salt, and\r\nkept under heavy weights. By-and-by the fish are taken out of the vats;\r\nthey are once more drained, and carefully brushed, to remove any\r\nimpurity, and bleached by being spread out singly on the sandy beach, or\r\non the rocks; when thoroughly bleached, they are collected into heaps\r\ntechnically called _steeples_, and when the _bloom_, or whitish\r\nappearance, comes out on the fish, they are ready for the market.\r\n\r\nThe cod is one of our best-known fishes, and was at one time much more\r\nplentiful and cheap. It is a deep-water fish, found in all northern\r\nseas, and in the Atlantic, but never in the Mediterranean. It is\r\nextremely voracious, greedily eating up the smaller denizens of the\r\nocean. It grows to a large size, and is very prolific, as most fishes\r\nare. A cod-roe has been found more than once to be half the gross weight\r\nof the fish, and specimens of the female cod have been caught with\r\nupwards of eight millions of eggs. The fish spawn in mid-winter: but\r\nhere our information ceases; when it becomes reproductive is unknown.\r\nDr. Bertram thinks that it is at least three years old before it is\r\nendowed with breeding power.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the cod is supposed to be very slow. Dr. Bertram quotes\r\nthe authority of a rather learned fisherman of Buckie, who had seen a\r\ncod which had got enclosed in a large rock pool, and he found that it\r\ndid not grow at a greater rate than eight to twelve ounces per annum,\r\nthough it had abundance of food.\r\n\r\nOn our own coast two modes of fishing are in common use: one by deep-sea\r\nlines, on each of which hooks are fastened at distances twelve feet\r\napart by means of short lines six feet long, called on the Cornish coast\r\n\"snoods.\" Buoys, ropes, or grapnels, are fixed to each end of the long\r\nline, to keep them from entanglement with each other. The hooks are\r\nbaited with capelan, lance, or whelks, and the lines are shot across the\r\ntide about the time of slack water, in from forty to fifty fathoms, and\r\nare hauled in for examination after six hours.\r\n\r\nAn improvement has been introduced upon this mode of fishing by Mr.\r\nCobb. He fixes a small piece of cork about twelve inches above the hook,\r\nwhich suspends the bait, and exhibits it more clearly to the fish by the\r\nmotion of the wave. The fishermen, when not engaged in hauling,\r\nshooting, or baiting the long lines, fish with hand-lines, holding one\r\nin each hand, each armed with two hooks, kept apart by a strong piece of\r\nwire. A heavy weight attached to the lower end of each line keeps it\r\nsteady near the ground, where the fish principally feed. Enormous\r\nquantities of cod, haddock, whiting, and coal-fish, with pollack, hake,\r\nling, and torsk, are taken in this way all round our coast. Of cod-fish\r\nalone four hundred to five hundred and fifty have been taken in ten\r\nhours by one man, and eight men have taken eighty score of cod in one\r\nday, fishing off the Doggerbank in five and twenty fathoms water.\r\nLatterly the Norfolk and Lincoln, and even the Essex, coasts, have\r\nyielded a large supply of fish, which are caught as described, and are\r\nstowed in well-boats, in which they are carried to Gravesend, whence\r\nthey are transhipped into market-boats, and sent up to Billingsgate by\r\neach evening tide; the store-boats not being allowed to come up higher,\r\nas the fresh water would kill the fish.\r\n\r\nThe Haddock (_Morrhua æglefinus_) is common in our markets; it is much\r\nsmaller than the cod, but in other respects not unlike it. It frequents\r\nthe same localities, and is caught with long lines baited usually with\r\nmussels; the old fish keep close in shore, and are only got with herring\r\nbait. In the village of Findhorn, Morayshire, large numbers of haddocks\r\nare dried and smoked with the fumes of hard wood and sawdust. Hence the\r\nterm \"Finnan haddies,\" an article in such request at a Scottish\r\nbreakfast. The village of Findhorn affords a very small portion of the\r\nhaddocks sold as such, but the true \"Finnans\" are supposed to have the\r\nfinest flavour.\r\n\r\nThe Whiting, _Merlangus vulgaris_ (Fig. 376), by some amateurs\r\nconsidered the most delicate of all the Gadidæ, is plentiful all round\r\nour coast. It spawns in March, and the eggs are quickly hatched. It\r\nprefers a sandy shore, and is usually found some miles from the coast.\r\nIt is a small fish, rarely exceeding twelve inches long, and seldom\r\nreaching two pounds in weight. The whiting is long in the body, clothed\r\nwith very small, thin, and round scales; its dorsal fins are, like the\r\ncod, three in number; it is without barbellary appendage; its upper jaw\r\nprojects over the lower; it is of a silvery white, sometimes relieved by\r\nan olive tint, which is contrasted upon the back by the blackish tint\r\nwhich distinguishes the pectoral and caudal fins, and by a black spot\r\nwhich some individuals have at the junction of the pectorals with the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 376. The Whiting (Merlangus vulgaris).]\r\n\r\nThe whiting inhabits the seas which wash the whole European coast, often\r\napproaching the shore in shoals, and are taken annually in great\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ABDOMINALES.\r\n\r\nThe fishes belonging to this order have the ventral fins under the\r\nabdomen placed behind, and not attached to the bones of the shoulder. It\r\nis much the most numerous and important of the great division of the\r\nMalacopterygeans. It includes most of our fresh-water fishes, a great\r\nnumber of marine species, and many like the salmon, which betake\r\nthemselves to the rivers in the spawning season to deposit their ova. We\r\nshall limit our remarks to the species which are essentially marine,\r\nsuch as the _Salmonidæ_, the _Clupeadæ_, and a few others.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALMONIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe fishes of this family are graceful in shape, and have the body\r\nclothed in scales; they have two dorsals, the first with soft rays,\r\nfollowed by a second, which is smaller, formed without rays, and\r\nadipose--that is, formed simply of a skin filled with fatty matter,\r\nunsupported by osseous rays. They inhabit the seas of temperate and\r\nnorthern regions; ascending the rivers at certain seasons, and, in some\r\ninstances, living exclusively in the great rivers and watercourses. They\r\nare found even in the most elevated mountain brooks. The grayling or\r\nshad, guiniad, sprat, trout, and the salmon, the type of the family,\r\nbelong to the group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 377. Adult Salmon.]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Salmo_ includes three species, namely, _Salmo salar_, _S.\r\ncroix_, and _S. trutta_, the trout. Of these, _S. salar_ (Fig. 377) has\r\nthe body long, the muzzle roundish, but more so in the male than in the\r\nfemale, the upper jaw provided with a fossette, into which the point of\r\nthe lower jaw penetrates; the back is a slaty blue, the sides and lower\r\npart of the body of a silvery diaphanous white, with great black spots\r\nscattered round the upper part of the head, round the upper edge of the\r\neye, and over the operculum or covering. Some brownish irregular spots,\r\nvariable both in form and size, are sprinkled over the sides. In other\r\nrespects their colours are subject to variations according to\r\ncircumstances. Before assuming the characters here indicated, however,\r\nthe salmon has passed through three stages, each of which is marked by\r\npeculiarities worthy of being noted. The young salmon (Fig. 378) is\r\ngreyish and striped with black. At the end of a year it has acquired a\r\nfine metallic hue. \"The other parts,\" according to Mr. Blanchard, \"are\r\nof a dazzling steel-blue; eight or ten large spots of the same brilliant\r\nblue cover it as with a silvery mantle on the sides; between these spots\r\na reddish, or, rather, brightish-rusty iron colour prevails; a black\r\nspot is usually observable in the middle of the operculum. The belly is\r\nof a fine diaphanous blue in the parr\" (Fig. 379).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 378. The Young Salmon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 379. Salmon, or Parr, a year old.]\r\n\r\nDr. Bertram gives a very clear and intelligible account of the early\r\ndays of the salmon, which was at one time veiled in mystery. \"The spawn,\r\ndeposited by the parent fish in October, November, and December, lies in\r\nthe river till about April or May, when it quickens into life. I have\r\nalready described the changes apparent in the salmon's egg, from the\r\ntime of its fructification till the birth of the fish. The infant fry\r\nare of course very helpless, and are seldom seen during the first week\r\nor two of their existence, when they carry about with them, as a\r\nprovision for food, a portion of the egg from whence they emanated. At\r\nthat time the fish is about half an inch in size, and presents such a\r\nsingular appearance that no person seeing it would ever believe that it\r\nwould grow into a fine grilse or salmon. About fifty days is required\r\nfor the animal to assume the shape of a perfect fish; before that time\r\nit might be taken for anything else than a young salmon. At the end of\r\ntwo years it has changed into a smolt. After absorbing its umbilical\r\nbag, which it takes a period of twenty to forty days to accomplish, the\r\nyoung salmon may be seen about its birthplace, timid and weak, hiding\r\nabout the stones, and always apparently of the same colour as the\r\nsurroundings of its sheltering place. The transverse bars of the parr,\r\nhowever, speedily become apparent, and the fish begins to grow with\r\nconsiderable rapidity, especially if it is to be a twelvemonth smolt,\r\nand this is very speedily seen at such a place as the Stormontfield\r\nponds. The young fish continue to grow for a little more than two years\r\nbefore the whole number make the change from parr to smolt, and seek the\r\nsalt water. Half the number of any one hatching begin to change at a\r\nlittle over twelve months from the date of their coming to life. And\r\nthus there is the extraordinary anomaly of fish of the same hatching\r\nbeing at one and the same time parr of half an ounce in weight, and\r\ngrilse weighing four pounds. The smolts of the first year return from\r\nthe sea, while their brothers and sisters are timidly disporting in the\r\nbreeding shallows of the upper streams.\" A late sea-going smolt explains\r\nthe anomaly of a spring salmon.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that, in its first stage, the Young Salmon (Fig. 378) is\r\ncalled a _parr_: during the second it is a _smolt_, namely, a parr plus\r\na jacket of silvery scales. While they continue in the state of parr\r\nthey lead a secluded life, totally unable to endure salt water, which\r\nwould kill them. When they have become smolts the fish betake themselves\r\nin bands to the sea. The sea-feeding being favourable, and the fish\r\nstrong enough for the salt water, a rapid growth is the consequence.\r\nAfter that they disappear, spreading themselves over the wide world of\r\nthe ocean. At the end of two months of a life mysterious and so far\r\nunknown, these fishes reappear in the rivers, returning to their native\r\npools; but how changed! _Quantum mutati!_ The smolt, which has lived in\r\nthe river two or three years, and only attained the length of six or\r\neight inches, returns at the end of two months' sojourn in the sea,\r\nweighing three to four, and after six months, ten or twelve pounds. It\r\nis now a grilse.\r\n\r\nAfter depositing their eggs the grilse remain some time in the fresh\r\nwater, when they again go to the sea. This second sojourn, of about two\r\nmonths, is sufficient to send it back weighing from six to twelve\r\npounds. It is now an adult salmon. Each new visit to the sea brings the\r\nsalmon back increased in size in proportion to the duration of the\r\nvoyage. In the month of March, 1845, the Duke of Athole took a salmon in\r\nthe Tay after it had deposited its eggs; he marked it by attaching a\r\nmetal label to it. It weighed ten pounds. The same individual with its\r\nmetal label was again fished up after five weeks and three days'\r\nabsence. It now weighed twenty-one pounds, having in the meantime\r\ntravelled forty miles down the river to the sea. This fish must,\r\nhowever, have made a long sea run during these thirty-eight days and its\r\nseeking up the river again.\r\n\r\nIn most circumstances, according to Mr. Blanchard, to whom we are\r\nindebted for much information relative to the development and migration\r\nof these fishes, salmon of various ages, which have nevertheless\r\nsojourned in the sea as grilse, adult salmon, and others intermediate\r\nbetween them, whose first sojourn at sea has extended to eight or ten\r\nmonths, ascend the rivers together in an order no less varied, the\r\nolder individuals heading the column, the youngest bringing up the rear.\r\n\r\nWhen the period for depositing their eggs approaches, a male and female\r\npair off, as it were; seeming to choose, by a common accord, a retired\r\nplace in which to spawn. Here both male and female employ themselves in\r\nhollowing out a nest in the strand, some eight or nine inches deep,\r\nwherein the female deposits her eggs, which the male fertilizes by\r\nshedding a milky fluid over them, sheltering the eggs afterwards by a\r\ncovering of sand.\r\n\r\nThe salmon only ascends the rivers to spawn. They eagerly return\r\nafterwards to salt water. When enjoying themselves in the water they\r\nswim slowly, floating near the surface; but in pursuit of any object, or\r\nif threatened with danger, they dart out of the water with extraordinary\r\npromptitude. The tail is, in fact, a true oar moved by powerful muscles;\r\na low waterfall is to the salmon no serious obstacle when it is impelled\r\nto ascend to its breeding-place. Curving its vertebral column, it forms\r\nitself into a sort of elastic spring; the arc of which being suddenly\r\nunbent, strikes the water with great force with the tail, and in the\r\nrebound it leaps to the height of several yards, clearing waterfalls of\r\nconsiderable height. If it falls without accomplishing its object, it\r\nrepeats the manœuvre until it is at last successful. It is especially\r\nwhen the leader of the band makes a successful leap that the others,\r\nacquiring new spirit from its example, throw themselves upwards until\r\ntheir emulation is rewarded by success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 380. Salmon Leap at Kilmorack.]\r\n\r\nSome of the British waterfalls are celebrated for their salmon leaps.\r\nWales, Scotland, and Ireland have each their celebrated leaps; in\r\nPembrokeshire, Argyleshire, and at Ballyshannon, in county Donegal, and\r\nat Leixlip. The cataract of Leixlip is upwards of twenty feet high, and\r\nthe country people make a holiday in order to see the salmon clear its\r\nheight. These acrobat fishes frequently fall before they finally\r\nsucceed, and it is not unusual for the people to place osier baskets to\r\ntrap them in their fall. At the cataract of Kilmorack, in\r\nInverness-shire (Fig. 380), the inhabitants living near the river have a\r\npractice of fixing branches of trees on the edge of the rocks. By means\r\nof these branches they contrive to catch the fishes which have failed in\r\ntheir leap; it is even asserted that sportsmen have been known to kill\r\nthem on the wing, as it were, in their leap. But the exploit, attributed\r\nto Lord Lovat by Dr. Franklin, is perhaps the nearest approach to the\r\nfabulous which we have met with.\r\n\r\nHaving remarked that great numbers of salmon failed in their efforts to\r\nsurmount the Falls of Kilmorack, and that they generally fell on the\r\nbank at the foot of the fall, Lord Lovat conceived the idea of placing a\r\nfurnace and a frying-pan on a point of rock overhanging the river. After\r\ntheir unsuccessful effort some of the unhappy salmon would fall\r\naccidentally into the frying-pan. The noble lord could thus boast that\r\nthe resources of his country were so abundant, that on placing a furnace\r\nand frying-pan on the banks of their rivers, the salmon would leap into\r\nit of their own accord, without troubling the sportsman to catch them.\r\nIt is more probable, however, that Lord Lovat knew that the way to enjoy\r\nsalmon in perfection is to cook it when fresh from the water, and before\r\nthe richer parts of the fish have ceased to curd. The principal salmon\r\nfound in the market are Tweed, Tay, North Esk, Spey, Skye, Norwegian,\r\nand above all Severn, said to be the best which comes to market, neither\r\nof which must be confounded with the imported American variety--the\r\norigin of the prevalent cheap London kipper--and the Cape, or\r\nred-mouthed variety. Cape and Americans are at once distinguished by\r\ntheir flesh boiling a blanched white. Tweed salmon are more varied; and\r\nthis river, famous in song, is also noted for its production of the\r\ngreatest proportion of bull-trout. The Tay yields the largest grilse and\r\nsalmon, but the Spey follows fast in her wake; Tay fish sometimes weigh\r\nsixty pounds. The minor Scotch rivers produce smaller but superior fish.\r\nSkye and West-coast grilse are short, thick, and small-headed, and\r\nproportionally more abundant. Trout are numerous; sea-bull, burn, or\r\nloch, and the so-called herring-trout, are the varieties usually met\r\nwith. The whitling of the Tweed, grayling of Tay, and tinnock of North\r\nand South Esk, are young sea and bull-trout, abounding in March and\r\nApril, when a sportsman will land fifty or sixty daily, weighing from\r\none quarter to a pound. Trout flesh varies in colour from a clear white\r\nto a dark red; the North Esk red trout is most esteemed. The best run\r\nfrom a pound and a half to three pounds. The burn-trout is always red,\r\nand has been killed as heavy as thirty pounds. The herring-trout, never\r\nfound in English rivers, and only caught on our coast by\r\nherring-trawlers, is a special favourite: may it not be the whitling of\r\nthe French rivers? In all other species colour varies with locality, and\r\ncannot be accounted for.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how rapidly the young salmon increase in size in the sea.\r\nDuring this stage of existence the salmon, being a carnivorous fish,\r\nrapidly develops itself from the grilse to the adult state. From a\r\ncareful analysis made by Dr. Wilson Johnston of the Bengal army, it\r\nappears that there is no recorded instance of healthy salmon partaking\r\nof herring or sand-lances; the tape-worm and other conditions of\r\nperverted appetite persisting in all. Tape-worm is most common in the\r\nhybrid Norwegian, and explains the reason why Clupeadæ are sometimes\r\nfound in their stomachs. Should the fish not be charged with spawn, it\r\nwill shortly return to sport among the dancing waves; but if matured for\r\nbreeding, at which period the female shows a dirty brown hue, and the\r\nmale a black, they mate, choose a spot for the salmon nest, and there\r\ndeposit myriads of ova. The longer a salmon continues in the river the\r\nduller their colour becomes; the flavour is greatly depreciated; so that\r\nIzaac Walton's statement, that \"the further they get from the sea they\r\nbe both fatter and better,\" is dead against our daily experience.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of river residence salmon never feed. It avails not to\r\nargue that fear acts as an emetic and empties the stomach; the\r\nincontestable fact remains that the entire gastro-intestinal tract _ab\r\nore ad ano_ is in ninety-nine per cent. devoid of any trace of food.\r\nJuvenile experience on the part of the fish, recurring as a phantasm,\r\ncauses them to snap at a shining artificial minnow or a gaudy fly, but\r\nthey never rise out of the water; the bait must dip to them, and when\r\nhooked they shake the intruder as a terrier does a rat. If salmon never\r\nfeed in fresh water, what is the rationale of their existing there?\r\nWell, the superabundant store of fat deposited in the areolar tissue\r\nappears to furnish a material which is functionally homologous to the\r\nfatty supply stored by the Asiatic and African doomba sheep, which is\r\ndrawn upon to sustain life-action, when névès, avalanches, or a heavy\r\nsnow-fall imprisons the herbage outcrop. That continued muscular\r\nexertion can be sustained without special fatigue on non-nitrogenous\r\ndiet, Fick and Wislicensus have proved by the recent ascent of the\r\nFaulhorn: it is moreover notorious that the chamois hunter and the\r\nHindoo runner prefer fats and saccharoids. Is there any show of reason,\r\nthen, why the salmon should not maintain its fresh-water muscular tear\r\nand wear by a stock of non-nitrogenous fatty material? That such is the\r\ntrue philosophy of salmon river life is borne out by the following\r\nfacts:\r\n\r\n1st. So soon as the exhausting secretions of the milt and roe take place\r\nthe spent fish turn seaward to recruit.\r\n\r\n2nd. The digestive secretions are not eliminated in the absence of food;\r\nthe most recent experience of physiology finds its echo here. Your boxer\r\ntrains on meat or nitrogenous aliment, but enters the list on\r\nhydro-carbons (fats, saccharines, and amylaceous substances). The salmon\r\nget into condition by immediately appropriating the albumen of the\r\nechinodermal ova, enter their life-struggle of wintry months in river\r\nwater with an incorporated stock of potential calorific aliment,\r\nconvertible, as occasion demands, into organic muscular mechanical\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nThe British rivers in which the salmon abound are the Severn, the Wye,\r\nthe Tweed, the Tay, the Don, and the Dee, with many of their\r\ntributaries, and in Ireland, the Shannon. Besides these, many of the\r\nwatercourses of lesser note adjoining the coast have been renowned for\r\ntheir salmon fisheries. Some of the Scottish rivers, especially, are\r\nfamous for the size and quality as well as numbers of salmon. In days\r\nnot very distant from ours, farm servants made it a condition of their\r\nhiring that salmon should not be served to them more than three days in\r\nthe week. These times are changed. In the districts in which this\r\ncondition was the most stringently insisted on, the proprietors derive a\r\nprincely revenue from this source alone. The Tay fisheries yield a\r\nrevenue of seventeen thousand pounds per annum. The Spey, for its length\r\nthe richest in Scotland, produces twelve thousand pounds per annum. The\r\nriver is only a hundred and twenty miles from its source to the sea, and\r\nits picturesque banks are celebrated in a local ballad, which says, not\r\nvery harmoniously, that\r\n\r\n    \"Dipple, Dundurcus, Dandaleith, and Dulocq,\r\n    Are the bonniest haughs of the run of the Spey;\"\r\n\r\nbut there's \"no standing water in the Spey!\" The river drains thirteen\r\nhundred miles of mountains, many of whose bases are more than a thousand\r\nfeet above the level of the sea. The Tweed, which has been \"poached\" and\r\nplundered, by its proprietors using unfair implements, until there was\r\nscarcely a fish in its upper waters, is slowly recovering under\r\nlegislative enactments, and its rental is now seven thousand five\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nSalmon abounds in the Loire and its affluents, but is much more rare in\r\nthe Seine and Marne. They enter the Rhine and the Elbe, and most of the\r\ngreat rivers of the north of Europe. In France they were formerly found\r\nin the rivers of Brittany, and in the Gironde. They are now very rare in\r\nthese rivers. The coast of Picardy is well furnished, but they are rare\r\nin Upper and Lower Normandy. In Norway, especially in the district of\r\nDrontheim, the salmon fishery is conducted on a large scale on the\r\nsea-shore as well as in the interior waters. The Baltic is rich in\r\nsalmon. Considerable fisheries are carried on in the waters of the Gulfs\r\nof Finland and Bothnia, as well as in the waters of Swedish Laponia. The\r\ntakes vary every year; in 1860 being much above the average throughout\r\nGreat Britain, or as in 1772, when the fish were so scarce in the Tweed,\r\nthat it was believed they had gone off the coast. They invariably go to\r\nleeward with the wind, and have been caught a hundred miles off land.\r\nSalmon are in condition at various periods of the year, apparently not\r\ndepending on the latitude of the rivers. Thus the Tay is one of the\r\nearliest rivers, while the North and South Esk are the latest, yet they\r\ndebouch within a few miles of each other. It is the opinion of Mr.\r\nJoseph Johnston of Montrose (whose acknowledged fifty years' practical\r\nexperience carries weight with it in all fishery parliamentary\r\ncommittees) that the Stormontfield ponds, by artificially rearing the\r\nparr, render them more helpless when they commence river life on their\r\nown account. As a natural result, the death-ratio is enormously\r\nincreased--cui bono? especially when the parr have only the _option_ of\r\nleaving, and are not compelled to go out. We must, therefore, receive\r\nDr. Bertram's narrative, much as we respect his authority, with some\r\nreserve. A seed will not grow, nor will a parr ever become a grilse,\r\nunless under given conditions: it is therefore an easy matter to explain\r\nthe anomaly of a parr passing seaward becoming a four-pound grilse,\r\nwhile its twin-brother remaining in the breeding-pond is conditionally\r\ndeveloped as only a half-ounce samlet, yet none the less a dwarfed\r\ngrilse--the possibility of growth existing all the while, although it\r\nwas not actively evoked by physical surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe modes of procedure in salmon fishery are very various. Spearing with\r\ntridents, and liestering with a weighted hook by torch-light, \"burning\r\nthe water,\" as the Scotch have it, as well as trammel, wear, and\r\ncruive-wear fishing, are now prohibited. Legal fishing in rivers is\r\nconfined to row nets, and fly and bait rod fishing, fixtures being\r\nillegal since 1810. Wear shot; a larger and heavier row-net placed at\r\nthe meeting of the waters; stake, fly, and bag-nets are used in the open\r\nsea. The latter is most in vogue, the former being almost superseded by\r\nthe fly. Fixtures on the sea coast were held to be legal in Lord\r\nKintore's case by House of Lords in 1828, and continued so till the\r\npassing of the recent Act. By this act all legal modes of fishing are in\r\naction from the first of February to the fourteenth of September, a\r\nperiod, however, now curtailed by twenty-eight days,--netting being\r\nillegal from Saturday to Monday in each week. It remains to be seen\r\nwhether the gourmet will enjoy his salmon better after its Sabbath rest;\r\nperhaps its ragout will then haunt him as it did Talleyrand's abbé, who,\r\ninstead of the _mea culpa_ of the Confiteor, iterated, \"Ah! le bon\r\nsaumon! ah! le bon saumon!\"\r\n\r\nA bag-net is composed of three chambers; the first, which is the widest,\r\nis at the entrance. The next is the doubling, and is one inch to the\r\nmesh narrower than the outer. The last is the fish court, where the fish\r\nby a simple and ingenious contrivance are prevented from finding the\r\ndoor by which they entered. It is partly floated by corks and partly by\r\nan empty cask on the head or principal riding rope. It is set in the sea\r\nby ropes attached to anchors, one anchor rope to the head of the net and\r\none on each wing at the entrance of the bag. The bag-leader is a\r\nseparate net held by a rope and anchor on the land side, and is fastened\r\nto the bag net. The principle of fishing is this: the tide makes a\r\ncurve on the leader of the bag, in this curve the fish swim into the\r\nnet. Bags are adapted for any kind of coast, and six or seven are run\r\nout to sea end on. Fly nets are the same as bags in principle, but\r\nslightly altered so as to adapt them for being fixed to stakes driven\r\ninto the sand instead of being moored by rope and anchor; they are\r\nalways used where the tide ebbs. Stake nets are expensive, and seldom\r\nused now-a-days. When in fishing trim they are, however, more deadly\r\nthan fly nets: their chambers are three times as large, but the\r\nprinciple of fishing in bag and stake nets is identical, leaders being\r\nused in all. It is noteworthy that trout are never caught in these\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nESOCIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThis family includes the _Pike_, which, being a fresh-water fish, need\r\nnot now occupy our attention; it includes also the singular genus\r\n_Stomias_, and the Flying-fish, _Exocoetus_.\r\n\r\nThe _Stomias_ have a body much elongated, the muzzle being very short,\r\nthe mouth very deeply cleft, the opercula reduced to small membranous\r\nlaminæ; the maxillarius fixed to the cheek; the inter-maxillary palatine\r\nand maxillary bones are rather sparingly furnished with teeth, and those\r\nare long and hooked. Similar teeth are observable on the tongue. The\r\nventral fins are placed far back, and the dorsal fin is placed opposite\r\nthe anal fin, on the hinder extremity of the body.\r\n\r\nOnly two species of this genus are known: the one of the Mediterranean,\r\n_Stomia boa_ (Fig. 381), the other of the Atlantic Ocean, _S. barbatus_,\r\nso called from the long barbula on the chin. Both species are black in\r\ncolour, with numerous small silvery spots on the abdomen. The body of\r\n_S. boa_ is thin, compressed, covered with little thin scales of\r\nblackish blue, much spotted on the back and abdomen, a little brighter\r\non the sides--the head, in some respects, recalling that of a serpent.\r\n\r\nFlying is so much associated in our minds with the usual denizens of the\r\nair, that the idea of flying-fishes seems to be a contradiction.\r\nNevertheless, some fishes possess that power, the fins being transformed\r\ninto wings, which they are enabled to raise for a few seconds. These\r\nwings, however, are neither long nor powerful, for they rather act the\r\npart of a parachute than wings. The distinguishing characteristic of the\r\n_Exocoetus_, or flying-fish, is the pectoral fins, nearly the length of\r\nthe body, the head flattened above and on the sides, the lower part of\r\nthe body furnished with a longitudinal series of carinated scales on\r\neach side, the dorsal fin placed above the anal, the eyes large, and the\r\njaws furnished with small pointed teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 381. Stomia boa.]\r\n\r\nThe Flying-fishes (Fig. 382) in their own element are harassed by\r\nattacks of other inhabitants of the ocean, and when under the excitement\r\nof fear they take to the air, they are equally exposed to the attacks of\r\naquatic birds, especially the various species of gulls. We have said\r\nthat, in their leap from the water, their fins sustain them rather as\r\nparachutes than wings, with which they beat the air. Mr. Bennett's\r\ndescription is pretty clear on this point. \"I have never,\" he says,\r\n\"been able to see any percussion of the pectoral fins during flight; and\r\nthe greatest length of time I have seen this volatile fish on the fly\r\nhas been thirty seconds by the watch, and the longest flight, mentioned\r\nby Captain Basil Hall, has been two hundred yards, but he thinks that\r\nsubsequent observation has extended the space. The usual height of their\r\nflight, as seen above the surface of the water, is from two to three\r\nfeet, but I have known them come on board at the height of fourteen\r\nfeet and upwards. And they have been well ascertained to come into the\r\nchains of a line of battle ship, which is considered to be upwards of\r\ntwenty feet. But it must not be supposed that they have the power of\r\nraising themselves into the air after having left their native element;\r\nfor on watching them I have often seen them fall much below the\r\nelevation at which they first rose from the water; nor have I ever in\r\nany instance seen them rise from the height to which they first sprang,\r\nfor I conceive the elevation they take depends on the power of the first\r\nspring.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 382. The Flying-fish (E. exiliens).]\r\n\r\nThe most common species is _E. volitans_. Its brilliant colouring would\r\nseem designed to point it out to its enemies, against whom it is totally\r\ndefenceless. A dazzling silvery splendour pervades its surface. The\r\nsummit of its head, its back, and its sides, are of azure blue; this\r\nblue becomes spotted upon the dorsal fin, the pectoral fin, and the\r\ntail. This fish is the common prey of the more voracious fishes, such\r\nas the shark, and the sea-birds; its enemies abound in the air and\r\nwater. If it succeeds in escaping the Charybdis of the water, the\r\nchances are in favour of its coming to grief in the Scylla of the\r\natmosphere--if it escapes the jaws of the shark, it will probably fall\r\nto the share of the sea-gull. The dolphin is also a formidable enemy to\r\nthe much-persecuted flying-fish. Captain Basil Hall gives a very\r\nanimated description of their mode of attack.[17] He was in a prize, a\r\nlow Spanish schooner, rising not above two feet and a half out of the\r\nwater. \"Two or three dolphins had ranged past the ship in all their\r\nbeauty. The ship in her progress through the water had put up a shoal of\r\nthese little things (flying-fish), which took their flight to windward.\r\nA large dolphin which had been keeping company with us abreast of the\r\nweather gangway at the depth of two or three fathoms, and as usual\r\nglistening most beautifully in the sun, no sooner detected our poor dear\r\nfriends take wing than he turned his head towards them, darted to the\r\nsurface, and leaped from the water with a velocity little short, as it\r\nseemed to us, of a cannon-ball. But though the impetus with which he\r\nshot himself into the air gave him an initial velocity greatly exceeding\r\nthat of the flying-fish, the start which his fated prey had got enabled\r\nthem to keep ahead of him for a considerable time. The length of the\r\ndolphin's first spring could not be less than ten yards, and after he\r\nfell we could see him gliding like lightning through the water for a\r\nmoment, when he again rose, and shot upwards with considerably greater\r\nvelocity than at first, and of course to a still greater distance. In\r\nthis manner the merciless pursuer seemed to stride along the sea with\r\nfearful rapidity, while his brilliant coat sparkled and flashed in the\r\nsun quite splendidly. As he fell headlong in the water at the end of\r\neach leap, a series of circles were sent far over the surface, for the\r\nbreeze, just enough to keep the royals and topgallant studding-sails\r\nextended, was hardly felt as yet below.\r\n\r\n\"The group of wretched flying-fishes, thus hotly pursued, at length\r\ndropped into the sea; but we were rejoiced to observe that they merely\r\ntouched the top of the swell, and instantly set off again in a fresh and\r\neven more vigorous flight. It was particularly interesting to observe\r\nthat the direction they took now was quite different from the one in\r\nwhich they had set out, implying but too obviously that they had\r\ndetected their fierce enemy, who was following them with giant steps\r\nalong the waves, and was gaining rapidly upon them. His pace, indeed,\r\nwas two or three times as swift as theirs, poor little things! and the\r\ngreedy dolphin was fully as quick-sighted; for whenever they varied\r\ntheir flight in the smallest degree, he lost not the tenth part of a\r\nsecond in shaping his course so as to cut off the chase; while they, in\r\na manner really not unlike that of the hare, doubled more than once upon\r\nthe pursuer. But it was soon plainly to be seen that the strength and\r\nconfidence of the flying-fish were fast ebbing; their flights became\r\nshorter and shorter, and their course more fluttering and uncertain,\r\nwhile the leaps of the dolphin seemed to grow more vigorous at each\r\nbound. Eventually this skilful sea-sportsman seemed to arrange his\r\nsprings so as to fall just under the very spot on which the exhausted\r\nflying-fish were about to drop. This catastrophe took place at too great\r\na distance for us to see from the deck what happened; but on our\r\nmounting high on the rigging, we may be said to have been in at the\r\ndeath; for then we could discover that the unfortunate little creatures,\r\none after another, either popped right into the dolphin's jaws as they\r\nlighted on the water, or were snapped up instantly after.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLUPEADÆ.\r\n\r\nOf this family the herring is the graceful, useful, and well-known type,\r\nto which also the pilchard, the shad, and the anchovy belong. The Clupea\r\nhave the body longish and compressed, especially at the belly, where it\r\ncomes to an edge; it is clothed with large scales, forming towards the\r\nbelly a saw-like edge, which is very thin and easily removed. One dorsal\r\nfin without spinous rays, and one ventral, both placed near the middle\r\nof the body, are its locomotive characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe Herring, _Clupea harengus_ (Fig. 383), is too well known to require\r\ndescription; its appearance is beautiful; but we shall only remark here\r\nthat its back, which in the fish after death is of an indigo bluish\r\ncolour, is green during life; the other parts vary considerably in their\r\ncolours and markings, sometimes representing written characters, which\r\nignorant fishermen have considered to be words of mystery. In November,\r\n1587, two herrings were taken on the coast of Norway, on the bodies of\r\nwhich were markings resembling Gothic printed characters. These herrings\r\nhad the signal honour of being presented to the King of Norway,\r\nFrederick II. This superstitious prince turned pale at sight of this\r\nsupposed prodigy. On the back of these innocent inhabitants of the deep\r\nhe saw certain cabalistic characters, which he thought announced his\r\ndeath and that of his queen. Learned men were consulted. Their science,\r\nas reported, enabled them to read distinctly words expressing the\r\nsentiment, \"Very soon you will cease to fish herrings, as well as other\r\npeople.\" Other _savants_ were assembled, who gave another explanation;\r\nbut in 1588 the king died, and the people were firmly convinced that the\r\ntwo herrings were celestial messengers charged to announce to the\r\nNorwegian people the approaching end of the monarch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 383. The Herring (Clupea harengus).]\r\n\r\nThis fish abounds throughout the entire Northern Ocean in immense\r\nshoals, which are found in the bays of Greenland, Lapland, and round the\r\nwhole coast of the British Islands. Great shoals of them occupy the\r\ngulfs of Sweden, of Norway, and of Denmark, the Baltic and the Zuyder\r\nZee, the Channel, and the coast of France up to the Loire, beyond which\r\nthey never appear to be found. But the finest herrings are caught on\r\nLoch Fyne, on the west coast of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe herrings are gregarious fishes, and live in great shoals closely\r\npacked together; shoals to be counted not by hundreds, but by thousands\r\nand tens of thousands, in many a shore and bay. It was the favourite\r\ntheory, not very long ago, that herrings emigrated to and from the\r\narctic regions. It was asserted, by the supporters of this theory, that\r\nin the inaccessible seas of high northern latitudes herrings existed in\r\noverwhelming numbers, an open sea within the arctic circle affording a\r\nsafe and bounteous feeding-ground. At the proper season vast bodies\r\ngathered themselves together into one great army, which, in numbers\r\nexceeding the powers of imagination, departed for more southern regions.\r\nThis great _Heer_, or army, was subdivided, by some instinct, as they\r\nreached the different shores, led, according to the ideas of fishermen,\r\nby herrings of more than ordinary size and sagacity, one division taking\r\nthe west side of Britain, while another took the east side, the result\r\nbeing an adequate and well-divided supply of herrings, which penetrated\r\nevery bay and arm of the sea round our coast, from Wick to Yarmouth.\r\nCloser observation, however, shows that this theory has no existence in\r\nfact. Lacepede denies that those periodical journeyings take place.\r\nValenciennes also rejects them. It is true that the herrings have\r\ndisappeared in certain neighbourhoods in which they were formerly very\r\nplentiful; but it is also certain that, in many of the fishing stations,\r\nfish are taken all the year round. Moreover, the discovery that the\r\nherring of America is probably a distinct species from that of Europe\r\n(which, smoked, is known as the \"Digby Chick\") is against the theory. In\r\nshort, there is a total absence of proof of their pretended migrations\r\nto high northern latitudes; and recent discoveries all tend to show that\r\nthe herring is native to the shores on which it is taken.\r\n\r\n\"It has been demonstrated,\" says Dr. Bertram, \"that the herring is\r\nreally a native of our immediate seas, and can be caught all the year\r\nround on the coast of the three kingdoms. The fishing begins at the\r\nisland of Lewis, in the Hebrides, in the month of May, and goes on as\r\nthe year advances, till in July it is being prosecuted off the coast of\r\nCaithness; while in autumn and winter we find large supplies of herrings\r\nat Yarmouth; there is a winter fishery in the Firth of Forth. Moreover,\r\nthis fish is found in the south long before it ought to be there,\r\naccording to the emigration theory. It has been deduced, from a\r\nconsideration of the annual takes of many years, that the herring exists\r\nin distinct races, which arrive at maturity month after month. It is\r\nwell known that the herrings taken at Wick in July are quite different\r\nfrom those caught at Dunbar in August and September; indeed I would go\r\nfurther, and say that even at Wick each month has its changing shoal,\r\nand that as one race appears for capture another disappears, having\r\nfulfilled its mission. It is certain that the herrings of these\r\ndifferent seasons vary considerably in size and appearance; localities\r\nare marked by distinctive features. Thus the well-known Loch Fyne\r\nherring is essentially different from that of the Firth of Forth; and\r\nthose differ again, in many particulars, from those caught off Yarmouth.\r\nIn fact, the herring never ventures far from the shore where it is\r\ntaken; and its condition, when it is caught, is just an index of the\r\nfeeding it has enjoyed in its particular locality. The superiority of\r\nflavour of the herring taken in our great land-locked salt-water lochs\r\nis undoubted. Whether or not resulting from the depth and body of water,\r\nfrom more plentiful marine vegetation, or from the greater variety of\r\nland food likely to be washed into these inland seas, has not yet been\r\ndetermined, but it is certain that the herrings of our western sea-lochs\r\nare infinitely superior to those captured in the more open sea.\"\r\n\"Moreover,\" he adds, \"it is now known, from the inquiries of the late\r\nMr. Mitchell and other authorities on the geographical distribution of\r\nthe herring, that the fish has never been noticed as being at all\r\nabundant in the arctic regions.\"\r\n\r\nThe herring feeds on small crustaceans, fishes just hatched, and even on\r\nthe fry of its own species. On the other hand, its enemies are the most\r\nformidable inhabitants of the ocean; the whales destroy them by\r\nthousands, but man, above all, carries on a war which threatens to be\r\none of extermination. In fact, the herring-fishery has been to certain\r\nnations the great cause of their prosperity. It was the foundation of\r\nDutch independence. Silk manufacture, coffee, tea, spices, which are\r\nproductive of great commercial movements, address themselves only to the\r\nwants of luxury or fashion. The produce of the herring fishery, on the\r\ncontrary, is one of necessity to the people; and Holland would have\r\nlanguished and quickly disappeared, with its fictitious territory, if\r\nthe sea had not added to its commercial industry this inexhaustible\r\nmine of wealth. That vast field it has worked with persevering ardour.\r\nStruggling for an existence, it has conquered. Every year numerous\r\nvessels leave the coast of Holland for this precious marine harvest. The\r\nherring fishery is, for the Dutch people, the most important of maritime\r\nexpeditions. It is with them known as the \"great fishery.\" Whaling is\r\nknown as the \"small fishery.\" The great fishery is a golden mine to\r\nHolland; it is, besides, a very ancient occupation with ourselves. We\r\nfind it flourishing in the twelfth century; for, in 1195, according to\r\nthe historians, the city of Dunwich, in the county of Suffolk, was\r\nobliged to furnish the king with twenty-four thousand herrings. We also\r\nfind mention made of the herring fishery in a chronicle of the Monastery\r\nof Evesham in the year 709.\r\n\r\nTowards the year 1030 the French sent vessels into the North Sea from\r\nDieppe for this fishing, nearly a century before the Dutch made the\r\nattempt; but as early as the thirteenth century that enterprising people\r\nemployed two thousand boats in this industry. The Danes, Swedes, and\r\nNorwegians also threw themselves into this trade at an early period. The\r\nFrench, Danes, and Swedes furnish at the present time only sufficient\r\nfor home consumption. The monopoly of foreign trade belongs to the\r\nEnglish, Dutch, and Norwegians. \"The quantity of herrings gathered every\r\nyear by our neighbours beyond the Channel,\" says Moquin-Tandon, \"is\r\ntruly enormous. In Yarmouth alone four hundred ships, of from forty to\r\nsixty tons, are equipped, the largest being manned by twelve men. The\r\nrevenue derived from this fleet is about seven hundred thousand pounds.\r\nIn 1857 three of these fishing-boats, belonging to the same proprietors,\r\ncarried home three millions seven hundred and sixty-two thousand\r\nfishes.\"\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of this century the Scottish fishermen have emulated\r\nthe zeal of the English. In a paper communicated to the British\r\nAssociation in 1854, Mr. Cleghorn, who has paid great attention to the\r\nsubject, states \"that there are nine hundred and twenty Wick boats\r\nengaged in the fishing, and that the produce was ninety-five thousand\r\nsix hundred and eighty barrels\" in one week alone, this being, however,\r\na falling off of sixty-one thousand barrels from the previous year. The\r\ncause of this immense falling off was ascribed to a storm which had\r\nswept along the coast at the height of the season; but Mr. Cleghorn was\r\ninclined to ascribe it mainly to over-fishing, which had gradually\r\ndiminished the number of herrings captured.\r\n\r\nThe boats employed by the French and Dutch in the herring fishery are\r\nabout sixty tons burden. They generally depart for the Orkney and\r\nShetland isles. They afterwards betake themselves to the German Ocean,\r\nand fish the Channel in November and December. These boats carry up to\r\nsixteen hands, according to their size. Arrived at their fishing ground,\r\nthey cast their nets, as seen in PL. XXIX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXIX.--The Herring Fishery.]\r\n\r\nThe lines of the Dutch fishermen are five hundred feet in length,\r\ncomposed of fifty or sixty different nets. The upper parts of these nets\r\nare supported by empty barrels or cork-buoys, the lower edge being\r\nweighted with lead or stones, which are kept at a convenient depth by\r\nshortening or lengthening the cords by which the buoys are attached. The\r\nsize of the mesh of the nets is such that the herrings of a certain size\r\nare caught in it by the gills and pectoral fins. If the first mesh is\r\ntoo large to hold them they pass through, and get caught by the next or\r\nsucceeding mesh, which is smaller. The herring-fishery is regulated by\r\nAct of Parliament, and the legal mode of capture is by means of what is\r\ncalled a drift-net. The drift-net is made of fine twine, marked with\r\nsquares of an inch each to allow for the escape of the young fish. The\r\nnets are measured by the barrel bulk, a net measuring fifty feet long by\r\nthirty-two deep, and each holding half a barrel. The drift is composed\r\nof many separate nets fastened together by means of a back rope, and\r\neach separate net of the series is marked off by a bladder or empty\r\ncask. The process is that described by Dr. Bertram in an article\r\npublished in the \"Cornhill Magazine.\" The writer had made his\r\narrangement for a night at the herring fishery under the auspices of\r\nFrancis Sinclair, a very gallant-looking fellow, who sails his own boat\r\nfrom Wick, and takes his own venture. Bounding over the waves with a\r\ngood capful of wind, they had left the shore and beetling cliffs far\r\nbehind them; they reached their fishing ground, where they tacked up and\r\ndown, eagerly watching for the oily phosphorescent gleam which is\r\nindicative of herrings. \"At last, after a lengthened cruise,\" he says,\r\n\"our commander, who had been silent for half an hour, jumped up and\r\ncalled to action. 'Up, men, and at them!' was the order of the night.\r\nThe preparations for shooting the nets at once began by lowering\r\nsail. Surrounding us on all sides was to be seen a moving world of\r\nboats; many with sails down, their nets floating in the water, and their\r\ncrews at rest. Others were still flitting uneasily about, their\r\nskippers, like our own, anxious to shoot in the right place. By-and-by\r\nwe were ready; the sucker goes splash into the water; the 'dog,' a large\r\ninflated bladder to mark the far end of the train, is heaved overboard,\r\nand the nets, breadth after breadth, follow as fast as the men can pay\r\nthem out, till the immense train is all in the water, forming a\r\nperforated wall a mile long and many feet in depth; the 'dog' and the\r\nmarking bladder floating and dipping in long zigzag lines, reminding one\r\nof the imaginary coils of the great sea-serpent. After three hours of\r\nquietude beneath a beautiful sky, the stars--\r\n\r\n    'The eternal orbs that beautify the night'--\r\n\r\nbegan to pale their fires, and, the gray dawn appearing, indicated that\r\nit was time to take stock. We found that the boat had floated quietly\r\nwith the tide till we were a long distance from the harbour. The skipper\r\nhad a presentiment that there were fish in his net; and the bobbing down\r\nof a few of the bladders made it almost a certainty, and he resolved to\r\nexamine the drifts. By means of the swing rope the boat was hauled up to\r\nthe nets. 'Hurrah!' exclaimed Murdoch of Skye; 'there's a lot of fish,\r\nskipper, and no mistake.' Murdoch's news was true; our nets were silvery\r\nwith herrings--so laden, in fact, that it took a long time to haul them\r\nin. It was a beautiful sight to see the shimmering fish as they came up\r\nlike a sheet of silver from the water, each uttering a weak death-chirp\r\nas it was flung into the bottom of the boat. Formerly the fish were left\r\nin the meshes of the net till the boat arrived in the harbour; but now,\r\nas the net is hauled on board, they are at once shaken out. As our\r\nsilvery treasure showers into the boat we roughly guess our capture at\r\nfifty crans--a capital night's work.\"\r\n\r\nBut there is a reverse to this medal. Wick Bay is not always rippled by\r\nthe land-breeze as on this occasion. \"The herring fleet has been more\r\nthan once overtaken by a fierce storm, where valuable lives have been\r\nlost, and thousands of pounds worth of netting and boats destroyed, and\r\nthe gladdening sights of the herring fishery have been changed to\r\nwailing and sorrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe Yarmouth boats are decked vessels of from fifty to eighty tons, with\r\nattendant boats, costing about one thousand pounds, and having stowage\r\nfor about fifty lasts; nominally, ten thousand, but, counted fisherwise,\r\nthirteen thousand, herrings, besides provision for a five or six days'\r\nvoyage. Leaving a hand or two in charge of the vessel, the majority of\r\nthe crew are out in the smaller boats, fishing.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch herring fishery is usually pursued during the night. When the\r\nnets are in the water the boat is left, as we have seen in Dr. Bertram's\r\nexcursion, to drift in the meantime. Each boat is furnished with a\r\nlantern, which serves the double purpose of attracting the shoals of\r\nfish, and preventing collisions with other boats. The herring fishery is\r\nextremely capricious in its results; one or two boats have been known to\r\ncarry into port the whole takings of a night. Valenciennes witnessed the\r\ncapture of a hundred and ten thousand herrings in less than two hours.\r\nThe nets are hauled in when moderately charged with fish by the crew;\r\nbut it is often necessary to have recourse to the capstan in the\r\nprocess. Some of the hands are stationed to detach the fish from the\r\nnets; others detach the nets from the buoys; while others again fold up\r\nand stow away the nets for future use.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Norway the electric telegraph is applied to the herring\r\nfishery, being employed to announce to the inhabitants of the fishing\r\ntowns the approach of the shoals of fish. In the fiords of Norway, where\r\nthe produce of the herring fishery is the principal means of existence\r\nto nearly the entire population, it often happened that the fish made\r\nits appearance at the most unexpected times, and on some parts of the\r\ncoast the shoals could only be met by one or two boats. Before the boats\r\nfrom the bays and fiords could take part in the fishery, the herrings\r\nhad deposited their spawn and returned to the open sea.\r\n\r\nTo prevent these disappointments, often repeated with great loss to the\r\nfishermen, the Norwegian government established, in 1857, a submarine\r\nelectric cable, along the coast frequented by the herrings, of a hundred\r\nmiles, with stations on shore at intervals conveniently placed for\r\ncommunicating with the villages inhabited by the fishermen. As soon as a\r\nshoal of herrings is known to be in the offing--and they can always be\r\nperceived at a considerable distance by the wave they raise--a telegram\r\nis despatched along the coast, which makes known in each village the\r\napproach to the bay in which the herrings have established themselves.\r\n\r\nThis important branch of industry has only assumed its real character\r\nsince the fourteenth century, and its sudden and prodigious extension is\r\ndue to the discovery of a simple Dutch fisherman, George Benkel, who\r\ndied in 1397. To this man Holland owes much of its wealth. He\r\ndiscovered, in short, the art of curing the herring so as to preserve it\r\nfor an indefinite time. From that moment the herring fishery assumed an\r\nunexpected importance, and became the source of much wealth to Holland\r\nand its industrious and enterprising people. Two hundred years after his\r\ndeath the Emperor Charles V. solemnly ate a herring on Benkel's tomb; it\r\nwas a small homage paid to the memory of the creator of a new industry\r\nwhich had enriched his native land.\r\n\r\nThe Shad (_Alosa_), which have the body round and more plump than the\r\nherring, are still more distinguishable by the arrangement of their\r\nteeth. More than twenty species of this genus are known, varying\r\nconsiderably in size. They inhabit the seas which wash the coasts of\r\nEurope, Africa, India, and America. One species is the Common Shad,\r\n_Alosa communis_ (Fig. 384), which is found in the Channel, the North\r\nSea, and all round our coast. It is of a silvery tint generally,\r\ngreenish on the back, with one or two black spots behind the gills. The\r\nshad approaches the mouths of rivers and great estuaries, and habitually\r\nascends them in the spring for the purpose of depositing its ova, and is\r\nfound at this season in the Rhine, the Seine, the Garonne, the Volga,\r\nthe Elbe, and many of our own rivers. In some of the Irish rivers the\r\nmasses of shad taken in the seine-net have been so great that no amount\r\nof exertion has been sufficient to land them. It sometimes attains a\r\nvery considerable size, weighing as much as from four to six pounds. The\r\nshad taken at sea are less delicate in their flesh than those caught in\r\nfresh water. The habits of the shad are very imperfectly known. Two\r\nspecies are found on the British coast, namely, the Twaite Shad of\r\nYarrell (_Alosa finta_), which is about fourteen inches in length,\r\nbrownish-green on the back, inclining to blue in certain lights, the\r\nrest of the body silvery white, with five or six dusky spots on each\r\nside arranged longitudinally. The jaws are furnished with distinct\r\nteeth; the tail deeply forked.\r\n\r\nThe second species, the Common or Allice Shad (_A. Communis_), is\r\nconsiderably larger, sometimes attaining twelve and even fifteen inches\r\nin length, having only one spot on each side of the body near the head;\r\nthe jaws without teeth, the scales small in proportion. This species is\r\nplentiful in the Severn, but rare in the Thames.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 384. The Allice Shad (Alosa communis).]\r\n\r\nThe shad is found in the Severn and Thames in considerable quantities\r\nabout the second week in July. They reach the fresh water about May,\r\ndeposit their spawn, and return to salt water in July. Their scales are\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nThe Sprat (_C. Sprattus_) has been the subject of a great controversy,\r\nlike the parr--one party contending that it is the young of the herring;\r\nanother, that it is a distinct species. Pennant, Yarrell, and many\r\neminent naturalists adopt the first view: yet its specific characters,\r\naccording to Pennant, are \"greater depth of body than the young herring,\r\ngill-covers not veined; teeth of the lower jaw so small as to be\r\nscarcely sensible to the touch; the dorsal fin placed far back, and the\r\nsharp edge of the abdomen more acutely serrated than in the herring.\"\r\nLike the herring, they inhabit the deep water during the summer,\r\nfollowing the shoal to the sea-shore in autumn. The sprat fishing\r\ncommences in November and continues during the winter months, when they\r\nare caught in such numbers that in some localities they have been used\r\nas manure.\r\n\r\nIn support of the individuality of the sprat, the serrated belly and\r\nrelative position of the fins are dwelt upon, together with the instance\r\ndetailed by Mr. Mitchell, the Belgian consul at Leith, who exhibited a\r\npair of sprats, having the roe and milt fully developed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the abundance of the sprat has been adduced as a\r\nreason for its being the young herring. In addition to this, anatomists\r\ndeclare their anatomy shows no difference but size. \"As to the serrated\r\nbelly,\" says Bertram, \"we may look on that as we do on the back of a\r\nchild's frock, namely, as a provision for growth.\" If this is so, Dr.\r\nBertram supplies material at once for thought and legislation. \"The\r\nslaughter of sprats,\" he says, \"is as decided a case of killing the\r\ngoose with the golden eggs as the grilse slaughter carried on in our\r\nsalmon rivers.\" But Mr. Bertram here overlooks a fact of which any one\r\nmay convince himself, namely, that young herrings are caught without the\r\nserrated belly; nay, the curer's purchase is regulated by the sprat's\r\nrough, and the herring's smooth belly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 385. The Pilchard (Clupea pilchardus).]\r\n\r\nThe Pilchard, _Clupea pilchardus_ (Fig. 385), sometimes called the gipsy\r\nherring, visits our coasts all the year round. It was at one time\r\nthought, as the herring was, to be migratory, but, like that fish, it is\r\nnow found to be a native of our own seas, and a constant inhabitant of\r\nour shores. It has been known to spawn in May, but the usual time is\r\nOctober, and authorities like Mr. Couch think it breeds only once a\r\nyear. Its visit to shallow water causes immense excitement; persons\r\nwatch night and day from the lofty cliffs along the Cornwall coast, and\r\nthe watchers (locally called \"huers\") signal the boats at sea beneath\r\nthem the moment they see indications of the approach of a shoal. Mr.\r\nWilkie Collins gives an animated picture of the \"huer:\" \"A stranger in\r\nCornwall, taking his first walk along the cliffs in August, could not\r\nadvance far without witnessing what would strike him as a very singular\r\nand even alarming phenomenon. He would see a man standing on the extreme\r\nedge of a precipice just over the sea, gesticulating in a very\r\nremarkable manner, with a bush in his hand, waving it to the right and\r\nto the left, brandishing it over his head, sweeping it past his feet; in\r\nshort, acting the part apparently of a maniac of the most dangerous\r\ndescription. It would add considerably to the stranger's surprise if he\r\nwere told that the insane individual before him was paid for flourishing\r\nthe bush at the rate of a guinea a week. And if he advanced a little, so\r\nas to obtain a nearer view of the madman, and observed a well-manned\r\nboat below turning carefully to the right and left, as the bush turned,\r\nhis mystification would probably be complete, and his ideas as to the\r\nsanity of the inhabitants would be expressed with grievous doubt.\r\n\r\n\"But a few words of explanation would make him alter his opinion. He\r\nwould learn that the man was an important agent in the pilchard fishery\r\nof Cornwall, that he had just discovered a shoal swimming towards the\r\nland, and that the men in the boats were guided by his gesticulations\r\nalone in their arrangements for securing the fish on which so many\r\ndepend for a livelihood.\"\r\n\r\nThe pilchard, the young of which is believed to be the sardine of\r\ncommerce, where its place is not usurped by the sprat, is sometimes\r\ntaken in the Channel, on the coasts of Brittany and Cornwall, and in the\r\nMediterranean, and on the coast of Sardinia, whence its commercial name.\r\nIn Brittany floating-nets are employed. The fishing is conducted in\r\nboats, each carrying five men; hundreds of these boats may sometimes be\r\nseen engaged at the same time three or four leagues from the coast, the\r\nnets being only drawn when they are fully charged, when the fish are\r\narranged bed upon bed in osier baskets, each boat returning habitually\r\nto port when it has secured twenty-five thousand fishes. The fishery\r\nextends over five or six months, the produce being about six hundred\r\nmillions of sardines.\r\n\r\nThe Basque fishermen employ a net in the form of a sack, with rings at\r\neach corner.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Cornwall, as we have hinted, it is one of the staple\r\nindustries, and pursued systematically. Where they come from, and\r\nwhither they go, seems alike unknown. All that is certain is, that they\r\nare met with in shoals swimming past the Scilly Islands as early as\r\nJuly. In August the inshore fishing begins, and they appear on various\r\nparts of the coast as far north as Devonshire and the south coast of\r\nIreland up to October and November; no doubt those which have escaped\r\nthe innumerable nets spread for them.\r\n\r\n\"The first sight from the cliffs of a shoal of pilchards,\" says Mr.\r\nCollins, in the work already quoted, \"is not a little interesting. They\r\nproduce on the sea the appearance of the shadow of a dark cloud, which\r\napproaches until you can see the fish leaping and playing on the surface\r\nby hundreds at a time, all huddled close together, and so near the shore\r\nthat they can be caught in fifty or sixty feet of water. Indeed, when\r\nthe shoals are of considerable magnitude, the fish behind have been\r\nknown literally to force the fish in front up to the beach, so that they\r\ncould be taken in baskets, or even with the hand.\r\n\r\n\"With the discovery of the first shoal, the active duties of the\r\nlookout, or huer, on the cliffs begin. Each fishing village places one\r\nor more of these men on the watch all round the coast. He is, therefore,\r\nnot only paid his guinea a week while he is on the watch, but a\r\npercentage on the produce of all the fish taken under his auspices. He\r\nis placed at his post, where he can command an uninterrupted view of the\r\nsea, some days before the pilchards are expected.\r\n\r\n\"The principal boat used is, at least, of fifteen tons burden, and\r\ncarries a large net called the 'seine,' which measures a hundred and\r\nninety fathoms in length, and costs a hundred and twenty\r\npounds--sometimes more. It is simply one long strip from eleven to\r\nthirteen fathoms in breadth, composed of very small meshes, and\r\nfurnished all along its length with cork at one edge and lead at the\r\nother. The men who cast this net are called 'shooters,' and receive\r\neleven shillings and sixpence a week, and one basket of fish out of\r\nevery haul.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the 'huer' discerns a shoal he waves his bush. The signal is\r\nconveyed to the beach by men and boys watching near him. The\r\n'seine'-boat, accompanied by another, to assist in casting the net, is\r\nrowed out to where he can see it; then there is a pause and hush of\r\nexpectation. Meanwhile the devoted pilchards press on--a compact mass of\r\nthousands on thousands of fish--swimming to meet their doom. All eyes\r\nare fixed on the 'huer;' he stands watchful and still, until the shoal\r\nis thoroughly embayed in water which he knows to be within the depth of\r\nthe 'seine.' Then, as the fish begin to pause in their progress, and\r\ngradually crowd closer and closer together, he gives the signal, and the\r\n'seine' is cast or 'shot' overboard.\r\n\r\n\"The grand object is now to enclose the entire shoal. The leads sink one\r\nside of the net perpendicularly to the bottom, the corks buoy the other\r\nto the surface of the water. When it has been taken all round the shoal,\r\nthe two extremities are made fast, and the fishes are imprisoned within\r\nan oblong barrier of netting. The art is how to let as few of the\r\npilchards escape as possible while the process is being completed.\r\nWhenever the 'huer' observes that they are startled, and separating at\r\nany particular point, he waves his bush, and thither the boat is\r\nsteered, and there the net is shot at once; the fish are thus headed and\r\nthwarted in every direction with extraordinary address and skill. This\r\nlabour completed, the silence of intense expectation that has hitherto\r\nprevailed is broken--there is a shout of joy on all sides--the shoal is\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n\"The 'seine' is now regarded as a great reservoir of fish. It may remain\r\nin the water a week or more; to secure it against being moved from its\r\nposition, in case a gale should come on, it is warped by two or three\r\nropes to points of land in the cliff, and is at the same time contracted\r\nin circuit by its opposite ends being brought together and passed\r\nlightly over its breadth for several feet. While these operations are\r\nbeing performed, another boat, another set of men, and another net, are\r\napproaching the scene of action.\r\n\r\n\"The new net is called the 'tuck;' it is smaller than the 'seine;'\r\ninside which it is to be let down, for the purpose of bringing the fish\r\nclose to the surface. The men who manage this net are called 'regular\r\nsewers.' The boat is first of all rowed inside the seine-net, and laid\r\nclose to the seine-boat, which remains stationary outside. To its bows\r\none rope at the end of the tuck-net is fastened. The tuck-boat now\r\nslowly makes the inner circle of the seine, the smaller net being\r\ndropped overboard, and attached to the seine at intervals as she goes.\r\nTo prevent the fish from getting between the two nets during the\r\noperation, they are frightened into the middle of the enclosure by\r\nbeating the water with oars, and stones fastened to ropes. When the\r\n'tuck' has at length travelled round the whole circle of the 'seine,'\r\nand is securely fastened to the seine-boat at the end as it was at the\r\nbeginning, everything is prepared for the great event of the\r\nday--hauling the fish to the surface.\r\n\r\n\"Now all is excitement on sea and shore; every little boat in the place\r\nputs off, crammed with idle spectators; boys shout, dogs bark, and the\r\nshrill voices of the former are joined by the deep voices of the\r\n'seiners.' There they stand, six or eight stalwart, sun-burnt fellows,\r\nranged in a row in the seine-boat, hauling with all their might at the\r\n'tuck'-net, and roaring out the nautical 'Yo, heave ho!' in chorus.\r\nHigher and higher rises the net; louder and louder shout the boys and\r\nthe idlers; the 'huer,' so calm and collected hitherto, loses his\r\nself-possession, and waves his cap triumphantly. 'Hooray! hooray!\r\nYoy--hoy, hoy! Pull away, boys! Up she comes! Here they are!' The water\r\nboils and eddies; the 'tuck'-net rises to the surface; one teeming,\r\nconvulsed mass of shining, glancing, silvery scales; one compact mass of\r\nthousands of fish, each one of which is madly striving to escape,\r\nappears in an instant. Boats as large as barges now pull up, in hot\r\nhaste, all round the nets, baskets are produced by dozens, the fish are\r\ndipped up in them, and shot out, like coals out of a sack, into the\r\nboats. Presently the men are ankle-deep in pilchards; they jump upon the\r\nbenches, and work on till the boats can hold no more. They are almost\r\ngunwale under before they leave for the shore.\"\r\n\r\nIn the process of curing, the scene becomes doubly picturesque, but this\r\nis shore-work, with which our space forbids us to deal.\r\n\r\n\"Some idea of the almost incalculable multitude of pilchards caught on\r\nthe Cornwall shores,\" says Mr. Collins, \"may be gathered from the\r\nfollowing data: At the small fishing cove of Trereen six hundred\r\nhogsheads were taken in little more than a week, during August, 1850.\r\nAllowing two thousand four hundred fish only to each hogshead (three\r\nthousand would be the highest calculation), we have a result of one\r\nmillion four hundred and forty pilchards caught by the inhabitants of\r\none little village alone, on the Cornish coast, at the commencement of\r\nthe season's fishing.\"\r\n\r\nThe Anchovy (_Engraulis_) is chiefly taken in the Mediterranean, and is\r\nmuch sought after for its delicate flavour when salted and cured. It is\r\na small, slender fish, about four to four and a half inches in length;\r\nhead pointed, mouth very wide, gill-openings large, abdomen smooth; when\r\nliving it is greenish on the back, silvery beneath; after death it\r\nchanges to a bluish black. The fishery which gives the most abundant\r\nresults takes place on the shores of the Mediterranean, principally on\r\nthe coast of Sicily, the isles of Elba, Corsica, Antibes, Frejus,\r\nSaint-Tropez, and Cannes. They are also taken on the Dalmatian coast,\r\nand in the neighbourhood of Ragusa.\r\n\r\nThe anchovy is only fit for food after being preserved and salted. The\r\nprocess of curing commences by throwing it into a strong brine; then,\r\nthe head and entrails being removed, they are arranged in rows in\r\nbarrels or boxes of tin, in alternate layers of salt and fish; finally,\r\nafter some days of exposure, they are hermetically closed and despatched\r\nto market. Those prepared on the Provençal coast were formerly carried\r\nto the fair of Beaucaire, whence they found their way all over France,\r\nand to many parts of Europe. Now, the anchovies cured at Marseilles, and\r\nother Provençal ports, are sent direct to the various markets of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACANTHOPTERYGEANS\r\n\r\ninclude the Perch family, which is altogether a fresh-water fish, and,\r\nhowever interesting in itself, foreign to our present purpose. It\r\nincludes also the cat-fish, which is also known as the _bar_, and more\r\ncommonly the wolf-fish, in Bas-Languedoc and Provence. It is common in\r\nthe Mediterranean, and in many of the great rivers which empty\r\nthemselves into it. The Cat-fish (Fig. 386) has the appearance of an\r\nelongated perch; its colour, in the adult state, is of a uniform silvery\r\nhue, marked with brown and yellow spots in the young.\r\n\r\nThe Weevers (_Trachinus_), forming another division of this family, are\r\ncharacterised by their very compressed head and the strong spines of the\r\noperculum. They are elongated in shape, with short muzzles; they have a\r\nhabit of burying themselves in the sand, and are formidable to\r\nfishermen, from the dangerous wounds they inflict with their spines.\r\n_Trachinus communis_ (Fig. 387) is widely diffused in the Atlantic and\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Uranoscopus_ are so named from the position of their eyes,\r\nwhich are directed towards the sky, from οὐρανὸς, the heavens, and\r\nσκοπέω, I regard. From this peculiar arrangement, they can only see\r\nabove them. They are closely connected with the cat-fish. _Uranoscopus\r\nvulgaris_ (Fig. 388) belongs to the Mediterranean, and is remarkable for\r\nits thick cubical head and erect spiny dorsal fins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 386. The Cat-fish.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 387. The Weever-fish (Trachinus communis).]\r\n\r\nThe Mullets (_Mullus_) have the body thick and oblong, the profile of\r\nthe head approaching the vertical line; scales large, two dorsal fins,\r\nwidely separated--the rays of the first spinous, of the second,\r\nflexible; two cirri at the lower jaw. Two species are known, both\r\ninhabitants of our west and south-west coasts: the Striped or Red Mullet\r\n(_Mullus surmuletus_), rare as British, and the Red Mullet (_M.\r\nbarbatus_). The first is a fine bright vermilion red, with three\r\ndominating yellow lines; the throat, breast, ventral, and lower surface\r\nof the tail are white, slightly tinged with rose; the fins have their\r\nrays more or less red, the iris of the eyes a pale gold colour, just\r\ntouched with red; the head bears two barbels. This beautiful fish is\r\nplentiful in the Mediterranean and sometimes in the Channel, common in\r\nthe gulfs of Gascony, and is frequently served on the table at Bordeaux\r\nand Bayonne, where it is known as the barbel; its flesh is a little\r\nflaky, of an agreeable flavour, but less esteemed than the red mullet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 388. Uranoscopus vulgaris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXX.--Agony of a Red Mullet at the Feast of\r\nHortensius.]\r\n\r\nThe Red Mullet (_Mullus barbatus_) is clothed in brilliant colours of\r\nbright red, mingling with silvery tints upon the side and belly; it\r\npresents fine indistinct reflections, but none of the yellow lines which\r\noccur in the preceding species. It is to its brilliant colouring that\r\nthe red mullet owes much of its celebrity. When we add that its flesh is\r\nwhite, firm, and agreeable to the taste, the estimation in which it was\r\nheld by the ancients is sufficiently explained. With the Romans the\r\nmullet was an object of luxury on which they expended fabulous sums;\r\nthey cultivated the fish in their fish-ponds not only as a delicacy of\r\nthe table, but for the beauty of form and colour. This fierce love of\r\nbeauty, however, too often approached to cruelty. Seneca and Pliny both\r\ngive us to understand that the rich patricians of Rome gave themselves\r\nthe barbarous pleasure of seeing the mullet expire under their eyes, in\r\norder to witness the various shades of purple, violet, and blue which\r\nsucceed each other--from cinnabar red to the palest white, as the animal\r\ngradually loses its strength, and expires by a slow and cruel death. The\r\ngreat rival of Cicero, the advocate Hortensius, who attracted crowds of\r\npeople to the Forum by his eloquent and elegant discourses, had an\r\ninordinate passion for this kind of enjoyment. These little inhabitants\r\nof the waters were led by a small canal which was carried under the\r\nfestive table, and his great enjoyment was to witness the agonies of the\r\nunhappy fish just taken from its native element and carried to the\r\ntable, palpitating with its dying convulsions, as it perished beneath\r\nhis eyes, he in the meanwhile enjoying a sumptuous banquet. The\r\npossession of these poor creatures had, in short, become the rage, a\r\nfurious passion, and their price soon became excessive. A fish of three\r\npounds produced a considerable sum to the fortunate fisherman, while one\r\nof four and a half pounds was simply ruinous, says Martial. Asinius\r\nGelius purchased one for eight thousand sesterces (upwards of sixty\r\npounds). Under Caligula, according to Suetonius, three mullets cost\r\nthirty thousand sesterces (about two hundred and forty pounds). Although\r\nit is no longer the object of ferocious enjoyment on the one hand, or\r\nprodigal expenditure on the other, it is still much sought after, both\r\nfor its beauty of colour and excellent table qualities. It is found in\r\nmany seas, but particularly in the Mediterranean, where it is taken all\r\nround the coast, usually in muddy bottoms; it is fished for both by line\r\nand net.\r\n\r\nThe Gurnards (_Trigla_) are remarkable for the singular manner in which\r\nthe head is mailed and cuirassed; the operculum and shoulder-bones are\r\narmed with spines, having trenchant blades, which give them a\r\ndisagreeable, even a hideous, physiognomy, and has procured them various\r\nnames, such as sea-frog, sea-scorpion, sea-devil, and sundry other\r\nequally significant names. With this forbidding appearance, however, the\r\ngurnards are among the most resplendent inhabitants of the sea. Nothing\r\ncan exceed the beauty of their markings; but the brilliancy with which\r\nNature has gifted them is their misfortune; it betrays them to their\r\nenemies, which are found in the air as well as in the water, and without\r\ntheir prodigious fecundity this species would long since have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 389. The Red Gurnard (Trigla pini).]\r\n\r\nTwelve species of Trigla are known. In the British seas the commonest\r\nspecies is the Grey Gurnard (_Trigla gurnardus_), a silvery-grey fish,\r\nmore or less clouded with brown and speckled with black. A rare species\r\nwith us, but very common in the Mediterranean, is the Red Gurnard,\r\n_Trigla pini_ (Fig. 389). It is of a fine bright rose-red colour, paler\r\nbeneath and more vivid about the fins, of which there are two distinct\r\ndorsal and one ventral. Beneath the pectorals are three detached rays;\r\nboth jaws and front of the lower palate are armed with fine velvety\r\nteeth. The Perlon, or Sapharine Gurnard (_T. hirundo_), is a large and\r\nhandsome fish, remarkable for the lively green and blue hues of the\r\ninner surface of its large pectoral fins.\r\n\r\nThe Flying Gurnard (_Dactylopterus volitans_) somewhat resembles the\r\nTriglas, but differs in having the fin-rays of the pectorals connected\r\nby membranes, by which it is enabled to support itself some time in the\r\nair, like the flying-fish; the pectorals, when extended, forming a sort\r\nof parachute (Fig. 390), which sustains it when it leaps out of the\r\nwater. Several species are known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 390. The Flying Gurnard (Dactylopterus volitans).]\r\n\r\nAll nature seems to conspire against these singular creatures, while\r\nthey have been gifted with the double power of swimming and flying. The\r\nflying-fish only escapes from the Bonitas, and other voracious fishes\r\nwhich pursue it on the bosom of the sea, to expose itself to the attacks\r\nof the inhabitants of the air. A crowd of sea-fowl, such as\r\nfrigate-birds, the albatross, and the gulls, carry on a bloody war with\r\nthem when they venture on flight. Enemies thus pursue the unhappy fish\r\nwhatever element it betakes itself to. Nevertheless it passes from one\r\nelement to the other with an energy which frequently defeats the attacks\r\nof its enemies. When it leaps from the sea to the height of five or six\r\nfeet, it sustains itself for several hundred feet, changing its\r\ndirection. In its flight it may be compared to that of the flying\r\ndragon; the popular name given to it is said to be derived from the\r\ngrunting noise they make on being taken out of the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABYRINTHIFORM PHARYNGEANS.\r\n\r\nIn the fishes of this order the superior pharyngeal bones are divided\r\ninto numerous and irregular little leaflets, which intersect the\r\ncellules situated under the operculum, which again serve to retain a\r\ncertain quantity of water. This water preserves the gills, however, when\r\nthe animal is dry, which permits them to live on shore, where they\r\nfrequently contrive to creep over great distances in search of water.\r\nThe genus _Anabas_, from ἀναβαίνω, to ascend, possess this\r\npeculiarity of organization in a remarkable degree; it enables them\r\nto leave the rivers and marshes and little watercourses of Borneo and\r\nJava, and other islands of the Indian Archipelago, and creep through\r\nthe herbage or along the ground by means of the inflexions of their\r\nbodies, the dentation of their opercules, of their spines and fins.\r\nThis fact, although only recently known to modern naturalists, was well\r\nknown to the ancients, and has been recorded by Theophrastus.\r\n\r\nThe family of the Scomberoides is the most important group in the order,\r\ncomprehending some of the fishes most useful to man, from their size,\r\nthe excellence of their flesh, and their abundance. The Tunny\r\n(_Thynnus_, Cuv.), the Mackerel (_Scomber scombrus_), and the Bonita\r\n(_Thynnus pelamys_), have yielded, from the remotest antiquity, immense\r\nresources as human food, both in the fresh and preserved state.\r\n\r\nThe tunny, while resembling the mackerel in many respects in its general\r\nform, is rounder, and attains a much larger size, being sometimes found\r\neight and nine feet in length, and weighing three to four hundred\r\npounds. The upper part of the body is a bluish-black; the belly is grey,\r\nwith silvery spots. These fishes sometimes present themselves in the\r\nAtlantic, but in the Mediterranean they are very abundant. At some\r\nperiods of the year they approach the coast in innumerable shoals, and\r\nin numerous serried ranks, forming a vast battalion, which conceals\r\nitself under the waves, and only betrays itself on the exterior by the\r\nmotion of the sea, caused by such vast numbers travelling rapidly\r\nthrough the water. In many localities the shoals of tunnies show\r\nthemselves in the spring, pursuing their way towards the east, and in\r\nthe autumn we find them pursuing an opposite direction. We see the same\r\nthing on the coast of Provence. Upon the coast of La Ciotat a first\r\nfishing takes place from the months of March to July, and a second\r\nagain from July to October. But at other points of the coast they arrive\r\nat the same time from very different directions; nevertheless, in some\r\nplaces they are only winter visitors.\r\n\r\nThe tunny-fishing goes back to the remotest antiquity. The Phoenicians,\r\nthe first navigators known, carried it on on the coast of Spain. In our\r\ndays the fishing is carried on with great activity on the coasts of\r\nProvence, of Sardinia, and Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe fishing is generally carried on by the tunny-net, but in Provence it\r\nis fished with an enclosed net called the _madrague_.\r\n\r\nThe tunny-net consists of a combination of nets, which is quickly cast\r\ninto the sea in order to head the tunnies at the moment of their\r\npassage. When the sentinels, posted for the purpose, as in the pilchard\r\nfishery, have signalled the approach of a shoal of tunnies and its\r\ndirection, by the indications of a flag which points to the spot\r\noccupied by the finny tribe, the fishing-boats are immediately directed\r\nto the designated spot, and ranged in curved lines, forming with the\r\nlight floating net a half circular enclosure, turned towards the shore,\r\nthe interior of which is called the _garden_. The tunnies thus enclosed\r\nin this garden, between the coast and the net, become agitated with\r\nterror. As they advance towards the shore they press upon the enclosure,\r\nor rather a new interior enclosure is formed with other nets held in\r\nreserve. In this second enclosure an opening is left, through which the\r\ntunnies have to pass. In continuing thus to diminish the space by\r\nsuccessive enclosures, each occupies a smaller diameter, in which the\r\nfish are enclosed in about a fathom and a half of water. At this moment\r\na species of seine-net is thrown into the garden. This net is hauled\r\ninto shallow water by force of arms, and the small tunnies are taken by\r\nthe hand, the larger by hooks. The boats are charged with them, and they\r\nare carried ashore. A single day's fishing will sometimes produce as\r\nmany as sixteen thousand tunnies, each from twenty to five and twenty\r\npounds weight.\r\n\r\nWhen the park, in place of being established for a single fishery, is a\r\npermanent construction in the sea, it is called, in Provence, a\r\nmadrague. The madrague is a vast enclosure. The netting which forms the\r\npartitions of its chambers are sustained by buoys of cork on the\r\nsurface, and kept down by heavy stones and other weights on the lower\r\nedge, and maintained in this position by cords, one extremity of which\r\nis attached to the net, and the other is moored to an anchor. The\r\nmadrague is intended to arrest the shoals of tunnies at the moment when\r\nthey abandon the shore in order to return to the open sea. For this\r\npurpose a long alley or run is established between the sea-shore and the\r\npark or madrague. The tunnies follow this alley, and, after passing from\r\nchamber to chamber, betake themselves at last to the body of the park.\r\n\r\nIn order to force them into the madrague they are pressed towards the\r\nshore by means of a long net, which is extended in their rear attached\r\nto two boats, each of which sustains one of the upper angles of the net.\r\nWhen the fishes come to the last compartment, the fishermen raise a\r\nhorizontal net, which makes a sort of plate of this compartment, in\r\nwhich the fishes are gradually raised to the surface of the water. This\r\noperation occupies the whole night.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the tunnies are collected in a very narrow space, and at\r\nvarying distances from the shore; and now the carnage commences. The\r\nunhappy creatures are struck with long poles, boat-hooks, and other\r\nweapons. The tunny-fishing presents a very sad spectacle at this its\r\nlast stage; fine large fish perish under the blows of a multitude of\r\nfishermen, who pursue their bloody task with most dramatic effect. The\r\nsight of the poor creatures, some of them wounded and half dead, trying\r\nin vain to struggle with their ferocious assailants, is very painful to\r\nendure. The sea, red with blood, long preserves traces of this frightful\r\ncarnage, of which an illustration is attempted in PL. XXXI.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the tunny is much esteemed, being firm and wholesome. It is\r\ncalled the salmon of Provence. \"For our part,\" says M. Figuier, \"we put\r\nit far above the salmon. Nothing is comparable to the fresh tunny thrown\r\ninto a hot frying-pan, and sprinkled with vinegar and salt. When\r\nproperly cooked, nothing can be more firm or savoury. In short, nothing\r\nof the kind can rival, or even be compared, with the tunny, as we find\r\nit at Marseilles and Cette.\"\r\n\r\nThe tunny is greatly celebrated among the Greeks and other inhabitants\r\non the shores of the Mediterranean, of the Propontus, and the Black Sea.\r\nThe Romans attached great value to certain parts of this fish, as the\r\nhead and the lower part of the belly. The neighbouring parts were in\r\nlittle esteem with them. They cut them into pieces and preserved them in\r\nvases filled with salt. They are now preserved with oil and salt\r\nafter being cooked; this preparation is in great request at Cette,\r\nMontpellier, and Marseilles. With a pot of marine tunny, preserved in\r\nthe vinegar of Lunel, a household is pretty well prepared for any event.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXXI.--Fishing for Tunny at Madrigue, on the Coast\r\nof Provence.]\r\n\r\nThe Mackerel (_Scomber scombrus_) is too well known to require minute\r\ndescription. Who has not admired these fishes, with their steel-blue\r\nback, and changing iridescent sides of gold and purple and green,\r\nrelieved by fine waving lines of deeper black, as they appear on the\r\nmarket-stalls, or as they are emptied in the early morning from the\r\nfishing-boat? The head is blue above, with black markings, the rest of\r\nthe body being heightened with iridescent shades of gold and purple.\r\n\r\nThere are two species of mackerel--that of the Atlantic and of the\r\nChannel, which has no swimming-bladder, _Scomber scombrus_ (Fig. 391),\r\nand the mackerel of the Mediterranean, _Scomber colias_, which has the\r\nswimming-bladder, and which is a very rare fish in our seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 391. The Mackerel (Scomber scombrus).]\r\n\r\nThe mackerel is common to all European seas: being the _Veirat_ of the\r\nBay of Languedoc; the _Aurion_ of Provence; the _Bretal_ in some parts\r\nof Brittany; the _Macarello_ of the modern Romans; the _Scombro_ of the\r\nVenetians; the _Lacesto_ of the Neapolitans; the _Cavallo_ of the\r\nSpaniards; the well-known Mackerel of our own shores, and the _Makril_\r\nof the Swedes; it is found on the coast of North America, and as far\r\nsouth as the Canary Islands. It is a wandering, unsettled fish, supposed\r\nto be migratory, but individuals are always found on our coast. They are\r\nsupposed to remain during the winter in the North Sea, and afterwards\r\non the coast of Scotland and Ireland in January and February, on their\r\nway to the Atlantic. Here their great army is divided into two: one\r\nbranch passes along the Spanish and Portuguese coasts, while the other\r\nenters the Channel. In May they appear on the coasts of England and\r\nFrance. In June they reach Holland. In July one portion of them returns\r\nto the Baltic, while another skirts the coast of Norway on its way to\r\nwinter quarters.\r\n\r\nLacepede estimated that this migration, which is so regular, and its\r\nstages so rigorously indicated, was irreconcilable with a great number\r\nof very precise observations; and he arrived at the conclusion that the\r\nmackerel passes the winter at the bottom of the sea, more or less remote\r\nfrom the coast, which they again approach in the spring. At the\r\ncommencement of the fine season they advance towards the shore which\r\nbest agreed with them, showing themselves often on the surface, like the\r\ntunny, traversing the sea in courses more or less direct or sinuous, but\r\nnever following the periodical circle which has been so ingeniously\r\ntraced out for them.\r\n\r\nMr. Milne Edwards also remarks that, if these legions of fishes ascended\r\nfrom the Polar seas, they ought to visit the Orkneys before they\r\nappeared in the Channel, and enter the Mediterranean later in the\r\nseason; but he is assured that they appear at the Orkneys late in the\r\nseason. It appears, in short, that there are different varieties which\r\nhaunt the several neighbourhoods in which they abound.\r\n\r\nThe largest mackerel are taken at the entrance of the Channel, but they\r\nare considered less delicate than the smaller fishes. The shoals of\r\nmackerel, it appears, never enter the Gulf of Gascony, but they abound\r\nalong the shores of Brittany up to the North Sea. It is about the month\r\nof April that they begin to be met with, but they are still small and\r\nwithout milt or roe. In the months of June and July the fish is in its\r\nmost perfect state. Towards the end of September and October mackerel of\r\nthe same year's birth are taken; finally, in November and December, the\r\nfishermen still fish them, and send them to market, but this is an\r\nirregularity, and the fishermen of Lowestoft and Yarmouth take their\r\ngreat harvest in May and June; in the Firth of Forth, and on the north\r\ncoast of Scotland, at a few weeks later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXXII.--Fishing for Mackerel off the Cornwall\r\nCoast.]\r\n\r\nAs mackerel are very voracious, they greedily devour all sorts of\r\nbait, but they are chiefly taken by the drift-net. The drift-net is\r\ntwenty feet deep and a hundred and twenty feet long, well buoyed at the\r\nupper edge, but without weights at the bottom. The meshes, made of fine\r\ntwine tarred to a reddish colour for preservation, are calculated to\r\nadmit the head of the fish and catch it by the gills, so as to prevent\r\nits withdrawal. A fleet of mackerel-boats dragging these large nets,\r\nwhich are extended vertically in the sea, or float between the two\r\ntides, is well represented in PL. XXXII.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the mackerel is fat and high flavoured. Among the ancients\r\na liquid was extracted from this fat called _garum_, which was\r\nconsidered a very nourishing preparation. The price of this liquid was\r\nvery high; in modern measures it was valued at about sixteen shillings\r\nthe pint. It was acrid, half putrefied, and very nauseous, but it had\r\nthe property of rousing the appetite and stimulating the digestive\r\norgans. Garum played the part of a condiment at a period when the\r\nexciting array of Indian spices was unknown. Seneca charges it, as we do\r\npepper and other hot spices taken in excess, with destroying the stomach\r\nand health of gourmands. This garum is spoken of by the traveller Pierre\r\nBelon, writing in the sixteenth century, as being held in great\r\nestimation at Constantinople in his time. Rondelet, the author of a very\r\nremarkable book published in 1554, who ate garum at the table of William\r\nPellicier, Bishop of Maguelonne, thought he could trace the liquid not\r\nto the mackerel, but to one of the Sparoïdes (_Sparus smaris_).\r\n\r\nThe mackerel possesses phosphorescent properties which cause it to shine\r\nin the dark, especially after death, when decomposition has commenced.\r\n\r\nThe mackerel is not only voracious, but, in spite of its small size, it\r\nhas the hardihood to attack fishes much larger and much stronger than\r\nitself. It is even said that they love human flesh. According to the\r\nnaturalist bishop, Pontoppidan, who lived in the sixteenth century, a\r\nsailor belonging to a vessel which had cast anchor in one of the\r\nNorwegian ports, when bathing one day in the sea, was assailed by a\r\nshoal of mackerel. His companions came to his relief; the eager band\r\nwere repulsed with great difficulty, but not till it was too late: the\r\nunfortunate sailor was so exhausted that he died a few hours after. By a\r\nnatural law of compensation the ubiquitous mackerel is surrounded by\r\nnumerous enemies; the larger inhabitants of the ocean eagerly devour\r\nthem. Certain fishes, in appearance very weak, such as the muræna, fight\r\nthem with great advantage.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the mackerel and other Scombridæ, we have the\r\nBonita of the Tropics. This is a fish of considerable size, celebrated\r\nby its pursuit in great shoals of the flying-fish, of which we have\r\nalready spoken. The Bonita (_Thynnus pelamys_) is not unlike the\r\nmackerel in shape, but less compressed, and upwards of twenty-five to\r\nthirty inches long. It is occasionally found on our coast, but only as\r\nan accidental visitor, for its true home is the Tropics. It is a\r\nbeautiful fish of a fine blue colour, with short pectoral fins and four\r\nlongitudinal bands on each side of the belly. It is easily harpooned\r\nfrom the dolphin-striker, and appears to have the power of generating\r\nelectricity. Any one grasping the living fish is violently shaken as in\r\npalsy, \"agitans,\" so much so that the most resolute son of Neptune\r\ncannot control his speech; every attempt culminates in an unintelligible\r\nspasmodic sputter. The instant the bonita is dropped, the muscles resume\r\ntheir routine action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 392. The Sword-fish (Xiphias gladius).]\r\n\r\nThe Sword-fish, _Xiphias gladius_ (Fig. 392), so called from the upper\r\njaw being elongated into a formidable spear or sword, was known to the\r\nancients, and has borne the name which recalls its salient\r\ncharacteristic from very early times. In short, it is recognized at a\r\nglance from its organic structure, and from the resemblance of its\r\nprolonged horizontal and trenchant muzzle to the blade of a sword. With\r\nthe ancients it was Ξιφίας, and _Gladius_; with the moderns it is the\r\nSword-fish, the _Dart_, the _Spece spada_, and _l'Espadon épée_.\r\n\r\nThis fish attains a great size, being found in the Mediterranean and\r\nAtlantic, in company with the tunny, from five to six feet in length.\r\nIts body is lengthy, and covered with minute scales, the sword forming\r\nthree-tenths of its length. On the back it bears a single long dorsal\r\nfin; the tail is keeled, the lower jaw is sharp, the mouth toothless,\r\nthe upper part of the fish bluish-black, merging into silver beneath. It\r\nseems to have a natural desire to exercise towards and against all the\r\narm with which Nature has furnished it; it darts with the utmost fury\r\nupon the most formidable moving bodies; it attacks the whale; and there\r\nare numerous and well-authenticated instances of ships being perforated\r\nby the weapon of this powerful creature.\r\n\r\nIn 1725, some carpenters having occasion to examine the bottom of a ship\r\nwhich had just returned from the tropical seas, found the lance of a\r\nsword-fish buried deep in the timbers of the ship. They declared that,\r\nto drive a pointed bolt of iron of the same size and form to the same\r\ndepth, would require eight or nine blows of a hammer weighing thirty\r\npounds. From the position of the weapon it was evident that the fish had\r\nfollowed the ship while under full sail; it had penetrated through the\r\nmetal sheathing, and three inches and a half beyond, into the solid\r\nframe.\r\n\r\nThe sword-fish has obstinate combats with the saw-fish, and even the\r\nshark, and it is supposed that when he attacks the bottom of a vessel he\r\ntakes that sombre mass for the body of an enemy. But this terrible\r\njouster, this Paladin of the abyss, often becomes himself the prey of a\r\nmost contemptible enemy. A miserable little parasite, the _Pennatula\r\nfilesa_, penetrates its flesh, and almost drives it mad with pain.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the young sword-fish is white, compact, and of excellent\r\ntaste; that of adults resembles the tunny. It is the object of a fishery\r\nof some importance in the Straits of Messina. The fishermen of Messina\r\nand Reggio join in this fishery with a great number of boats, carrying\r\nbrilliant flambeaux, while one of the crew is stationed at the mast-head\r\nto announce the approach of the sword-fish. At a given signal the boats\r\nrush on to attack them with the harpoons (Fig. 393). During this fishery\r\nthe sailors sing a peculiar melody, but without words.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 393. Fishing for Sword-fish in the Straits of\r\nMessina.]\r\n\r\nThe family of _Pediculate Pectorals_ is so named from the fishes of\r\nwhich it is composed bearing their pectoral fins on a species of arm\r\nwhich forms a prolongation of the carp bone; it includes the Frog-fish,\r\nremarkable for the excessive circumference of the head and shoulders as\r\ncompared with the rest of the body, the immense opening of a jaw, armed\r\nwith pointed teeth, and the cutaneous jagged stripes of various lengths\r\nwith which it bristles at many points. Its skin is soft, smooth, and\r\nwithout scales or other asperities; the members which support the\r\npectorals, and other peculiarities, combine to render it a hideous and\r\nforbidding object, well calculated in ignorant and superstitious times\r\nto frighten the multitude. The remains of this fish, prepared in such a\r\nmanner as to be transparent, and rendered luminous by a lamp enclosed\r\nin its interior, has often helped to deceive and frighten the timid by\r\nits fantastic appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 394. The Frog-fish (Lophius piscatorius).]\r\n\r\nThe Frog-fish, _Lophius piscatorius_--Linn. (Fig. 394), which attains\r\nthe length of five or six feet, lives in the sand, or sunk in the mud,\r\nleaving the long and movable filaments with which the head is furnished\r\nto float in the water; the shreds which terminate them act as natural\r\nbait when they float about in different directions, from their\r\nresemblance to worms and other living creatures. The fishes which swim\r\nabove them, and which they see very well by the assistance of their two\r\neyes placed on the summit of the head, are attracted by these deceitful\r\ndecoys. When the prey arrives near to the enormous jaws, which are\r\nalmost always wide open, it is engulfed and torn to pieces by its\r\nstrongly-hooked teeth.\r\n\r\nThis manner of lying in ambush, and fishing, as it were, with a hook and\r\nline for fishes which its conformation does not permit it to pursue, has\r\nacquired for it the name of the frog-fish, which is sometimes given to\r\nit. It is found more or less in all parts of the Mediterranean and in\r\nmany parts of the Atlantic, being frequently taken both in the Gulf of\r\nGascony and in the Channel.\r\n\r\nThe family of _Labridæ_ comprehends: I. The Wrasse (_Labrus_), a genus\r\nof fishes decked in the most lively colours; for the yellow, green,\r\nblue, and red, forming bands of spots, give the body the appearance of\r\nbeing enriched with brilliant metallic reflections. II. The _Julis_, of\r\nRisso, the Mediterranean species of which is remarkable for its fine\r\nviolet colour, relieved on each side by an orange band.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 395. Adult Green and Red varieties of Labrus\r\ncommunis.]\r\n\r\nOf the _Labridæ_ we represent here, as a type of the family, the adult\r\nGreen and Red Labrus (Fig. 395), varieties of the commonest species,\r\ncalled the sea-parrot, the body of each being oblong, clothed with large\r\nscales: a dorsal fin, frequently with membranous appendages, thick\r\nfleshy lips, and large conical teeth; cheeks and gill-covers clothed\r\nwith scales; gill-covers smooth at the edges; three spines in the anal\r\nfin. In _Julis_ the cheeks and gill-covers are without scales; in other\r\nrespects they resemble _Labrus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 396. The Pipe-fish (Fistularia tabacaria).]\r\n\r\nAmong the acanthopterygeous fishes we shall only notice the singular\r\nfamily of _Fistulariadæ_, or Pipe-fishes, so called from the extreme\r\nelongation of the fore part of the head, forming a tube, at the\r\nextremity of which is the mouth. Of this family, _Fistularia tabacaria_\r\n(Fig. 396) may be considered the type. The tube of the muzzle is long\r\nand flat, and from the caudal fin springs a terminal filament nearly as\r\nlong as the body. This species of pipe-fish is common at the Antilles;\r\nit attains the length of about three feet, but its flesh is leathery and\r\ninsipid. It feeds upon crustaceans and small fishes, which it drags from\r\nthe interstices of the rocks and stones by means of its long and taper\r\npipe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe close our abbreviated history of the Ocean and such of the\r\ninhabitants with which it swarms as seems most likely, from their habits\r\nand other peculiarities, to interest the readers, conscious of its many\r\nimperfections. Where every creature which moves and breathes in the\r\nwatery world is so full of interest, it will not surprise the reader to\r\nlearn that one of the editor's chief difficulties has been that of\r\nselection, his most painful task that of rejecting the vast mass of\r\ninteresting matter he had necessarily to pass in review.\r\n\r\nWe have shown in the first chapter of this work that nearly\r\nthree-fourths of the surface of the earth is bathed by the sea. Struck\r\nwith this vast extent of ocean, a witty French writer says, \"One is\r\nalmost tempted to believe that our planet was specially created for\r\nfishes.\" They are, indeed, a very important part of creation; they form,\r\nas it were, a bond uniting the vertebrate to invertebrate animals. They\r\nhave a more complicated organization than any of the other oceanic\r\ninhabitants (except the Cetaceæ), as they are also the most numerous,\r\nthe most varied in form, and by far the most brilliant in colour, and\r\nthe most active in their movements.\r\n\r\nPliny, the naturalist, describes ninety-four species of fishes. Linnæus\r\nhas characterised four hundred and seventy-eight. The naturalists of the\r\npresent day know upwards of thirteen thousand, a tenth of which are\r\nfresh-water fishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: \"Lieutenant and Commander,\" by Captain Basil Hall.
