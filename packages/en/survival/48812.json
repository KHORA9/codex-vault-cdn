I. PHILADELPHIA, _Twelfth Month, 1820_. _No. 12._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE DESULTORY REMARKER.\r\n\r\nNo. XI.\r\n\r\n    Man is a being, holding large discourse,\r\n    Looking before and after.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my last number I availed myself of the occasion, to dwell with\r\nsome emphasis, on the necessity and advantage of retrospection.\r\nThe past is rife with lessons of experience, fitted to serve as\r\nwaymarks and beacons, for the government of human conduct in the\r\nsubsequent course. Obvious as this may appear, it is nevertheless\r\nlamentably true, as the venerable JOHN ADAMS has somewhere observed,\r\nthat our attention is too frequently monopolized in the pursuit\r\nof present enjoyment, and that each succeeding generation is not\r\nsatisfied, until it \"_has made experience for itself_.\" It is,\r\nhowever, gratifying to believe, that many are not so unmindful of\r\ntheir real interests, and so destitute of true wisdom; but are on\r\nproper occasions employed, in \"looking before and after.\" To these\r\nno apology will be necessary, for recommending a preparation for\r\nthose duties, which appertain to the severe and dreary season, upon\r\nwhich we are now entering. A season, above all others calculated,\r\nto illustrate the generous and benevolent principles of our\r\nnature; and which calls most loudly and authoritatively for their\r\nexercise. When indigence is gifted with peculiar eloquence, which\r\nthe powers of a BURKE or an AMES, could scarcely _heighten_. We are\r\nfortunately so constituted, that the sight of distress is amply\r\nsufficient to awaken our sympathy, without requiring by a conclusive\r\nmoral deduction, the establishment of the fact, that it is our duty\r\nto sympathize with the objects of it. Ere long a wide field will\r\npresent itself for mitigating the sufferings and relieving the wants\r\nof\r\n\r\n  THE POOR.\r\n\r\nThe most efficacious _preventive_, of the evils attendant on\r\npoverty, is the general and extensive application of mental and\r\nmoral discipline to the rising generation. This is the only radical\r\nremedy for the disease; a truth, which should never be lost sight\r\nof, by forecasting statesmen and enlightened philanthropists. But\r\nthe urgency and immediate pressure of want, requires prompt relief,\r\nnot to be derived from this source. The array of indigence will\r\nbe unusually great during the approaching winter, for even honest\r\nindustry is frequently disappointed in its search after employment.\r\nAmong the objects of public beneficence there will generally be\r\nfound a considerable number of this description, whose condition is\r\nthe result of misfortune alone; while the calamities of others, are\r\nthe consequences of vice and improvidence. But it should always be\r\nremembered, that wretchedness and misery from whatever cause they\r\nmay proceed, are entitled to commiseration; and that genuine charity\r\nimitates though at infinite distance, the example of our beneficent\r\nCreator, who \"maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,\r\nand sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\"\r\n\r\nThe most salutary mode of extending relief, is unquestionably\r\nthat of employment. Idleness is uniformly prejudicial to sound\r\nmorals, and intrinsically mischievous in its character. When\r\nalms are distributed it is moreover, far preferable to furnish\r\nthe necessaries of life, rather than money, which is too often\r\nmisapplied. As this is to many, the season of plenty and good cheer,\r\nparticularly in the country, the situation of the necessitous is\r\nfrom this circumstance, entitled to primary consideration. I well\r\nremember, when a boy and residing in a neighbouring county, being\r\ndespatched to some of the poor in the vicinity, with a part of the\r\nsuperabundance of the season; and their grateful and affectionate\r\nbenedictions on the head of their revered benefactor, will never be\r\nforgotten. I may perhaps be indulged in adding, that I rejoice in\r\nbelieving, that he is now in that city \"which hath foundations;\" not\r\none of whose inhabitants can say \"I am sick.\" The example of such\r\nmen is cheering and of signal advantage to society. \"The memory of\r\nthe just is blessed.\"\r\n\r\nI am well aware, that to dwell at length on the subject here\r\nrecommended, would, as it respects some of the patrons of the Rural\r\nMagazine be an act of supererogation. To such as these, all that is\r\nnecessary to stimulate to a performance of their duties to their\r\nunfortunate fellow creatures, is to be made acquainted with their\r\nsituation. The extension of the necessary assistance, is however, in\r\nmany instances, a task of peculiar delicacy. Reference is here made\r\nto those who have seen happier days, and whose feelings, will not\r\npermit them publicly to solicit relief. In this class will generally\r\nbe found, the least obtrusive but most deserving individuals; those\r\nwho have undoubted claims on the generous and humane.\r\n\r\nAs this is probably the last opportunity, I shall have of\r\nholding communion, with my readers, it would be a source of real\r\nsatisfaction, should ever a solitary hint of a profitable tendency,\r\nbe derived from this valedictory paper. If the pressure of grief and\r\nprivation, in a single instance be obviated, the reward would indeed\r\nbe ample. Duties of the most imperative and important character, are\r\nconstantly claiming our serious and assiduous attention. I cannot\r\ntherefore, with more propriety, terminate my humble, desultory\r\nlabours, than by sincerely and fervently desiring, that when the\r\nwinter of old age and the evening of life shall arrive, we may enjoy\r\nthe delightful consciousness of having faithfully performed our\r\nrespective obligations, and particularly those which we owe to THE\r\nPOOR. ☞\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE TEACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter season of desolation as it is, has charms and attractions\r\nof its own. There is something exquisitely mournful in the whistling\r\nof its winds through the leafless branches of the forest, and around\r\nthe lonely walls of a country dwelling. The absence of all gaudy\r\ndecoration and its mute and desert loneliness give to the landscape\r\na sublimity which is in perfect keeping with these deeper and\r\nharsher tones of the lyre of Æolus. The mind that has been at all\r\ntrained in the school of nature, and has drank of true philosophy\r\nat its source amid fields and groves and mountains, can catch the\r\nglow of inspiration even from these stern and rugged features. It\r\ncan discern in every aspect of external nature a feeling and an\r\nattribute, touching and peculiar, and can trace out in them those\r\nmoral truths, of which it would seem that the forms of the physical\r\ncreation, are but the types and the shadows. It is not merely that\r\nthe remembrance of the enjoyments and hopes which have faded, and of\r\nthe friends that are no more, subdue and chasten the soul; but the\r\nnaked majesty, and austere colouring of the landscape find an answer\r\nin the mind. We view life divested of its gaudy trappings, and\r\nfeel the cold reality of what had mocked us at a distance with the\r\nsemblance of felicity. At the same time the hopes which endure, and\r\nthe happiness which we know by experience to be solid, gain value\r\nin our estimation, as we are thus lifted above a dependence upon\r\ntransitory and perishing enjoyments.\r\n\r\nI had by this train of thought, wrought up my mind to a comfortably\r\ngood opinion of my own fortitude, during a long ramble to-day, and\r\nwas seated by my solitary fire this evening, meditating on the\r\nsubject I had chosen for my next essay, and heaping Pelion upon Ossa\r\nin my dreams of future eminence; when a letter from the Editors was\r\nbrought in, announcing that the next number of the Magazine was to\r\nbe the last.\r\n\r\nThe angels in Milton's Pandemonium did not more suddenly contract\r\ninto pigmies than did my fancied self-importance at this sad\r\nintelligence. From the port and aspect of one of the enlighteners\r\nof mankind, I shrunk at once into an obscure village schoolmaster\r\nunknown beyond the next township, and unnoticed save by a few of my\r\nhumble patrons,\r\n\r\n    \"Husbanding that which I possess within\r\n    And going to the grave unthought of.\"\r\n\r\nI looked round in my despair upon the naked walls, and they seemed\r\nto stare at me, as even they had never heard of me. An impertinent\r\ncricket in the wainscot was the only audible being near me and\r\nhe kept on with his idle song, as if in derision. The feeling of\r\ndisappointment for a time overpowered my philosophy, and I did not\r\nsee my gorgeous hopes vanish into air without a bitter feeling\r\nof regret. To be thus cut off in the very bud of expectancy of\r\nauthorship--to have that genial current of thought and feeling\r\nwhich was but beginning to flow turned back to its source, are\r\nmisfortunes which none but an author can estimate, and which send us\r\nback to the dull routine of life with altered feelings.\r\n\r\nWhy should I not please myself with the imagination of what I might\r\nhave achieved? It is true that of the many into whose hands these\r\nnumbers have fallen, the greater part may have passed over my essays\r\nunnoticed.\r\n\r\nAn inharmonious period--an uninteresting sentiment may have caught\r\ntheir attention, and they have turned away with indifference. Of\r\nthose who have perused them, many have done it in a spirit of\r\ncaptious criticism, some with forced and struggling attention, and a\r\nfew perhaps with real kindness and interest. Yet all this ill will\r\nand kindness and indifference has been lost upon me, and disturb\r\nnot the dreams of vanity. The stillness of my retreat has not been\r\nbroken by a sound of murmur or approbation, nor do I know that I\r\nhave lightened for a moment the brow of sorrow, or attracted for a\r\nstill shorter period, the attention of the busy, or the idle:--happy\r\nif from this failure also, I shall learn another lesson of humility\r\nand shrink without repining into my own proper dimensions.\r\n\r\nI have not entered my first and fortieth year without being armed\r\nagainst such disappointments, nor will I part from them with whom\r\nI have thus sojourned in ill will or moroseness. What, though I\r\nmay have overrated my own powers of entertainment, I have only\r\nproclaimed that which is the open or secret vanity of all. What\r\nthough my readers have gone unsatisfied away from the table which\r\nI had spread for them?--the fruits of wisdom though harsh and\r\naustere in their taste, have not lost their savour with _me_; they\r\nstill hang upon the tree of nature, and I can yet gather them for\r\nmy own sustenance, though it be in solitude and obscurity. Minds,\r\nto whose gigantic proportions I feel myself a pigmy have exhausted\r\ntheir skill in portraying the beauty of virtue, and the world still\r\nlingers in corruption and defilement. My own efforts would have\r\nbeen more important, and I begin to think that I should have wasted\r\nmy strength in idle display; if indeed I had not met with rueful\r\ndiscomfiture.\r\n\r\nReader! if in thy journeyings through the heart of Pennsylvania thou\r\nshouldst pass the quiet hamlet of Plainfield--if the recollection\r\nof these essays still linger in thy heart and thou shouldst seek\r\na further acquaintance with their author--stop, and inquire at my\r\nlandlord's for\r\n\r\n  THE VILLAGE TEACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCURSION FROM EDINBURGH TO DUBLIN.\r\n\r\nBY AN AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Glasgow, Friday, April 11, 1817._\r\n\r\nAt the hour of dinner we went to 'North wood-side,' a delightful\r\ncountry residence about two miles from Glasgow, the property of an\r\nopulent merchant. It is situated upon the Kelvin, a tributary stream\r\nof the Clyde, and together with its grounds, exhibits striking\r\nevidences of the elegant but costly taste of its proprietor. The\r\ngentleman has been in America, and was not a little attached to its\r\nform of government,--a partiality which naturally extended itself to\r\nthe individuals concerned in its administration; and, accordingly\r\nwe were gratified with beholding the portraits of several of our\r\nmost distinguished countrymen adorning the walls of his apartments.\r\nThe afternoon passed highly to our satisfaction; and we would gladly\r\nhave accepted an invitation, which was given with a sincerity which\r\ncould not be mistaken, to protract our visit beyond the day, but for\r\nengagements which required our return to Glasgow. After coffee we\r\nleft North Wood-side, and reached the city in season to sup at the\r\nRev. Dr. Chalmers'.\r\n\r\nIt had been my good fortune to meet and become partially acquainted\r\nwith this extraordinary man in Edinburgh. He has politely invited\r\nme to visit him in Glasgow, and this morning I called at his house,\r\nand passed half an hour with him. I found him then much engaged\r\nin completing some preparations for a journey to London which he\r\nis to commence on Monday. He desired my company at supper in the\r\nevening, and extended the invitation to my companion. We found a\r\nfew friends at his house, among whom were several ladies. Mrs. C.\r\npossesses a pleasing person, and engaging manners, and performed\r\nthe honours of the table with great propriety. Dr. C. had finished\r\nthe necessary arrangements for his journey, and entered freely into\r\nan animated and instructive conversation. His colloquial powers are\r\nof a high order. Even in familiar conversation, he is impressive\r\nand striking;--although he seems not to be ambitious of display\r\nor the distinction of taking a lead.--He is at home on most of\r\nthe popular topics of the day. In discussing any of interest, he\r\nengages '_totus in illis_.' His thoughts in that case are rapid, and\r\nhis remarks,--assuming the complexion of his fervid mind,--abound\r\nin glowing but easy illustrations. He spoke very feelingly upon\r\nthe subject of the English poor laws, and the alarming increase\r\nof mendicity in Scotland. As in instance of the unnatural state\r\nof things in Glasgow itself, he referred to the sum of 14,000_l._\r\nsterling, which in less than a month had been raised by subscription\r\nin this single city, for the relief of the poorer classes. To the\r\nhonour, however, of the wealthy population of Glasgow, it should be\r\nadded, that the moneys thus contributed, have been more than enough,\r\nwith other private benefactions, to supply the present need; and\r\nthe surplus has been funded to meet some future, and I hope, very\r\ndistant exigency.\r\n\r\nConversation at table turned upon that dark and malignant spirit of\r\ninfidelity, which under various forms, seems insidiously stealing\r\nlike a pestilence throughout society. Dr. C's. remarks upon this\r\nsubject were very eloquent, both in commenting upon the different\r\nmasks which it assumes, and the coverts wherein it lurks, and in\r\nsuggesting some seemingly effectual checks to the prevalence of this\r\ntremendous evil. The inquiries of Dr. C. relative to America, as\r\nwell now as during a former interview, indicated no small degree of\r\nattention which he has paid to its civil and religious institutions.\r\nHe spoke in terms of great commendation of the writings of the\r\nlate Jonathan Edwards, and pronounced them to be among the ablest\r\nin English theology. In metaphysics he considers Edwards to have\r\nequalled the deepest thinkers of his age.\r\n\r\nThe supper at Dr. C's. was liberally and tastfully provided.\r\nImmediately after its removal, and before the wine was placed upon\r\nthe table, the service of evening devotion was introduced. It was\r\nsimple but engaging; consisting of a portion of scripture, which\r\nwas read with great solemnity, and a prayer, during which all the\r\ncompany kneeled, as is usual to family devotions throughout this\r\ncountry. The servants were present. It was nearly twelve o'clock\r\nwhen we took leave of Dr. C. A very friendly request which he made\r\nthat I would visit him hereafter in Glasgow, I fear that I shall\r\nnever have it in my power to comply with.\r\n\r\n_Glasgow, 14th April._--Yesterday I had the satisfaction to hear\r\nDr. Chalmers preach once more. It was generally understood that it\r\nwould be the last time that he would officiate in Glasgow for two\r\nor three months, and the crowds which assembled to hear him were\r\nvery great. He was absent from his own pulpit, by exchange, in the\r\nmorning, which did not prevent, however many from following him\r\nto the church where he preached. The Tron, in the afternoon, was\r\noverflowing some time before the hour of service, and the rush of\r\npeople to the doors was as great as I have seen at Covent Garden,\r\nwhen John Kemble was to play. I repaired early to the church with\r\nsome ladies, and we were fortunate in procuring excellent seats.\r\nDr. C. fully equalled my expectations, although I have heard him in\r\nEdinburgh produce a superior effect. The eloquence of this great\r\nman is very vehement and impassioned. The effect which he produces\r\nin preaching, does not consist in approaching his point by any\r\nartful and covert process of reasoning and illustration, but by\r\nopenly marching up and confronting it with unhesitating and manly\r\nintrepidity. Whatever faults may be detected in Dr. C's. style by\r\nthe cool eye of fastidious criticism,--from the profusion of his\r\nornaments, the overstraining of his metaphors, the redundancy of\r\nhis expression,--perhaps there is no person living who, when once\r\nseen and heard, would be pronounced more free from the petty or\r\nlaboured artifices which are generally employed to recommend and\r\nenforce instruction. So regardless is he of the factitious aids of\r\ncomposition, that his style may often be considered negligent, and\r\nsometimes even coarse. This again may be regarded by hyper-critics\r\nas a species of affectation; a contrary, and, I believe, a juster\r\ninference may be drawn from the fact. Dr. C. unconsciously\r\noverlooks, while he is thought studiously to disdain, the more\r\ncommon trappings and gilding of composition. In preaching, he seems\r\nwholly absorbed in his sublime occupation, and to be irresistibly\r\nborne along by the grandeur of his theme. As a man, he appears to\r\nsink under a prostrating sense of his own personal nothingness,\r\nbut as a herald of the Christian faith, he rises to the majesty\r\nof more than mortal elevation. In discussing the great truths of\r\nRevelation, his imagination kindles; and strange it would be if\r\nit did not. The fire which is elicited is the natural effect of\r\nthe rapid motion of his thoughts, combined with the fervour of his\r\nardent piety. His single services yesterday were enough to prove\r\nhim the first preacher of his age. In each of his discourses there\r\nare some parts which are particularly impassioned, and at such\r\nmoments he hurries onward as with the excitement of inspiration,\r\nand produces an effect which Whitefield could not have surpassed.\r\nAt these times, too, the listening audience may be seen bending\r\nforward, as if with breathless interest, to catch each word as it\r\nfalls from his lips; and, on his arriving at the conclusion of the\r\nparticular train of sentiment, again arousing as from the spell of a\r\ndream to the reality of conscious existence. This is not fancy, or\r\nif it be, it is one which I am not singular in possessing. Dr. C. at\r\nleast produces the effect of awakening susceptibilities in the most\r\nobdurate bosoms. I was present one evening when he was preaching\r\nin lady Glenorchy's chapel, in Edinburgh, and occupied a seat next\r\nto Spurzheim, the celebrated craniologist. I noticed that he was\r\ndeeply engaged by the preacher. On his finishing, I inquired what he\r\nthought of him? \"It is too much, too much,\" said he, passing his\r\nhand across his forehead, \"my brain is on a fever by what I have\r\nbeen hearing,\" a striking declaration from a cold and phlegmatic\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\nDr. C. seems to act and feel as one, who, possessed of great\r\nintellectual endowments, is conscious that he owes them all to the\r\nservice of religion. His aim apparently is, to \"bring every thought\r\ninto captivity to the truth of Christ,\" and to \"cast down each\r\nlofty imagination,\" at the foot of the cross. To add to the weight\r\nof his discourses, he is accustomed to call into requisition the\r\nabounding stores of his various knowledge. In delivering his sermons\r\nhe usually commences in a low, but always a distinct tone of voice;\r\nand proceeds for some time with a calm and uniform utterance. As\r\nhis subject is developed, his mind and feelings gradually expand,\r\nand his voice is insensibly raised. His manner at first is not\r\nprepossessing; nor indeed is his voice to an English ear, as it\r\nhas much of the Fifeshire accent. The hearer, however, soon loses\r\nwhatever is disagreeable in each; and even forgets the man while\r\nlistening to the message of the preacher. Dr. C. appears turned of\r\nthirty-eight, in his person he is tall, and rather slender; his hair\r\nand complexion incline to dark; his eye is a blue tending to gray,\r\nand is distinguished at first only by a certain heaviness in its\r\nexpression. It beams however in conversation, and flashes in public\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\nSome facts in the history of this extraordinary man are peculiar.\r\nFor the first few years of his ministry he was settled in Kilmany,\r\nan inconsiderable parish in the county of Fife. While there, he was\r\ngenerally accounted a man of talents, but rather indifferent to the\r\nduties of his profession, fond of social and gay company, proud of\r\nhis intellectual powers no less so of his acquirements, and careless\r\nof the construction which the more serious part of the community\r\nmight put upon his principles and sentiments. If I am correctly\r\ninformed, he occasionly gave lectures in natural philosophy at the\r\nuniversity of St. Andrews, and was considered as belonging to the\r\nmoderate party in the kirk. Dr. Brewster applied to him to write\r\nthe article _Christianity_, in his Encyclopedia; and it is said,\r\nthat the train of thought into which his investigation led him,\r\nterminated in convictions which had the effect of changing his whole\r\ncourse of life and sentiments; and from that moment, entering into\r\nthe ranks of orthodoxy, he became an eminent and powerful champion\r\nof the faith. His essay has since been published in a separate form,\r\nand entitled the \"Evidences of Christianity.\" Shortly after this\r\nremarkable change, his reputation rose with astonishing rapidity;\r\nhis zeal in the service of religion became inextinguishable; and if\r\nthe excellence of a preacher is to be estimated by his popularity,\r\nDr. C. is decidedly the first in Great Britain. He was transferred\r\nto Glasgow two or three years ago. His parish is very large,\r\nconsisting, as he told me, of nearly ten thousand souls. So great\r\na number imposes duties upon him peculiarly heavy: nor does his\r\nconstitution seem capable of sustaining his fatigues. In delivering\r\nhis discourses from the pulpit, which generally occupy an hour, it\r\nis usual with him to stop about midway, and read a hymn of six or\r\neight verses, to be sung by the audience, while an opportunity is\r\ngiven him to recover from the partial exhaustion occasioned by this\r\nvehement oratory. The people in Edinburgh are desirous of erecting\r\na church for him, and requesting him to settle among them; but an\r\nobstacle is found in the jealousy of the inhabitants of Glasgow,\r\nwho look with no small uneasiness upon every thing which tends to\r\naggrandize the reputation of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF ANTS.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] The Natural History of Ants; by M. P. Huber, &c. Translated from\r\n  the French, with Additional Notes, by J. R. Johnson, M.D. F.R.S. &c.\r\n  London, 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural history is perhaps the most amusing of studies, though not\r\nso useful as botany or chemistry. It is curious to observe, however,\r\non the score of utility, that the more minute parts of creation are\r\nof infinitely greater importance than the superior creatures in the\r\nscale of animal life. A knowledge of entomology is calculated to\r\nelicit more for the benefit of man, than an acquaintance with the\r\nhabits of the larger brutes: the bee, the silk-worm, the cochineal\r\ninsect, the Spanish fly, &c. &c. are far more essential to our\r\npurposes than the lion, the elephant, the rhinoceros, or the bear;\r\neven the sheep and the cow, only compete with these insects, as\r\nclothiers and victuallers; and the horse is merely physical force,\r\nsubjected to the direction of the higher animal, man.\r\n\r\nIf we consider further, how very limited our research has yet been\r\ninto the micrographick world, we may, without being thought too\r\nspeculative, lose ourselves in the idea of the immensity of stores\r\nthat remain to be discovered in the merest particles of animated\r\nnature: there is nothing too much to be imagined on the subject.\r\nBut our business is rather to disclose the remarkable circumstances\r\nascertained by the ingenious M. Huber, than to indulge in\r\ntheorising; and we therefore proceed to his History of Ants, which\r\nwe have found so entertaining, that we have no doubt it will furnish\r\nmore than one interesting paper for our work.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter treats of the architecture of ants. The various\r\nhabits of these wonderful insects are amply described; and were\r\nwe not assured by ocular examination, of the truth of many of the\r\nparticulars, we could hardly extend our belief to the prodigies\r\nrelated by the author: but we have witnessed so much that we can\r\ncredit all. To return to the architecture; we find that their\r\nhabitations, their cities, are not the least curious of their\r\nperformances. Mr. Huber details the formation of a domicile by the\r\nfallow ants, and adds--\r\n\r\n\"Our little insects, now in safety in their nest, retire gradually\r\nto the interior before the last passages are closed, one or two only\r\nremain without, or concealed behind the doors on guard, whilst the\r\nrest either take their repose, or engage in different occupations in\r\nthe most perfect security.\r\n\r\n\"I was impatient to know what took place in the morning upon these\r\nant-hills, and therefore visited them at an early hour. I found them\r\nin the same state in which I had left them the preceding evening.\r\nA few ants were wandering about on the surface of the nest, some\r\nothers issued from time to time from under the margin of the little\r\nroofs formed at the entrance of the galleries: others afterwards\r\ncame forth who began removing the wooden bars that blockaded the\r\nentrance, in which they readily succeeded. This labour occupied them\r\nseveral hours. The passages were at length free, and the materials\r\nwith which they had been closed scattered here and there over the\r\nant-hill.\r\n\r\n\"Every day, morning and evening, during the fine weather, I was a\r\nwitness to similar proceedings. On days of rain, the doors of all\r\nthe ant-hills remain closed. When the sky is cloudy in the morning,\r\nor rain is indicated, the ants who seem to be aware of it, open but\r\nin part their several avenues, and immediately close them when the\r\nrain commences. It would appear from this they are not insensible of\r\nthe motive for which they form these temporary closures.\r\n\r\n\"To have an idea how the straw or stubble roof is formed, let us\r\ntake a view of the ant-hill at its origin, when it is simply\r\na cavity in the earth. Some of its future inhabitants are seen\r\nwandering about in search of materials fit for the exterior work,\r\nwith which, though rather irregularly, they cover up the entrance;\r\nwhilst others are employed in mixing the earth, thrown up in\r\nhollowing the interior, with fragments of wood and leaves, which are\r\nevery moment brought in by their fellow-assistants; and this gives a\r\ncertain consistence to the edifice, which increases in size daily.\r\nOur little architects leave here and there cavities, where they\r\nintend constructing the galleries which are to lead to the exterior;\r\nand as they remove in the morning the barriers placed at the\r\nentrance of their nest the preceding evening, the passages are kept\r\nentire during the whole time of its construction. We soon observe it\r\nto become convex; but we should be greatly deceived did we consider\r\nit solid. This roof is destined to include many apartments or\r\nstories. Having observed the motions of these little masons through\r\na pane of glass which I adjusted against one of their habitations, I\r\nam enabled to speak with some degree of certainty upon the manner in\r\nwhich they are constructed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never found, even after long and violent rains, the interior of\r\nthe nest wetted to more than a quarter of an inch from the surface,\r\nprovided it had not been previously out of repair, or deserted by\r\nits inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ants are extremely well sheltered in their chambers, the\r\nlargest of which is placed nearly in the centre of the building;\r\nit is much loftier than the rest, and traversed only by the beams\r\nthat support the ceiling: it is in this spot that all the galleries\r\nterminate, and this forms, for the most part, their usual residence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those ants who lay the foundation of a wall, a chamber, or\r\ngallery, from working separately, occasion now and then a want of\r\ncoincidence in the parts of the same or different objects. Such\r\nexamples are of no unfrequent occurrence, but they by no means\r\nembarrass them. What follows proves that the workman on discovering\r\nhis error, knew how to rectify it.\r\n\r\n\"A wall had been erected with the view of sustaining a vaulted\r\nceiling, still incomplete, that had been projected from the wall\r\nof the opposite chamber. The workman who began constructing it,\r\nhad given it too little elevation to meet the opposite partition\r\nupon which it was to rest. Had it been continued on the original\r\nplan, it must infallibly have met the wall at about one-half of its\r\nheight, and this it was necessary to avoid. This state of things\r\nvery forcibly claimed my attention; when one of the ants, arriving\r\nat the place, and visited the works, appeared to be struck by the\r\ndifficulty which presented itself; but this it as soon obviated,\r\nby taking down the ceiling and raising the wall upon which it\r\nreposed. It then, in my presence, constructed a new ceiling with the\r\nfragments of the former one.\r\n\r\n\"When the ants commence any undertaking, one would suppose that\r\nthey worked after some preconceived idea, which indeed would seem\r\nverified by the execution. Thus, should any ant discover upon the\r\nnest, two stalks of plants, which lie cross-ways, a disposition\r\nfavourable to the construction of a lodge; or some little beams\r\nthat may be useful in forming its angles and sides, it examines the\r\nseveral parts with attention, then distributes with much sagacity\r\nand address parcels of earth, in the spaces, and along the stems,\r\ntaking from every quarter materials adapted to its object, sometimes\r\nnot caring to destroy the work that others had commenced; so much\r\nare its motions regulated by the idea it has conceived, and upon\r\nwhich it acts, with little attention to all else around it. It\r\ngoes and returns, until the plan is sufficiently understood by its\r\ncompanions.\"\r\n\r\n\"From these observations, and a thousand similar, I am convinced\r\nthat each ant acts independently of its companions. The first who\r\nconceives a plan of easy execution, immediately gives the sketch of\r\nit: others have only to continue what this has begun, judging, from\r\nan inspection of the first labours, in what they ought to engage.\r\nThey can all lay down plans, and continue to polish or retouch their\r\nwork as occasion requires. The water furnishes the cement they\r\nrequire, and the sun and air hardens the materials of which their\r\nedifice is composed. They have no other chisel than their teeth, no\r\nother compass than their antennæ, and no other trowel than their\r\nfore-feet, of which they make use in an admirable manner, to affix\r\nand consolidate the moistened earth.\"\r\n\r\nWe have thus some idea of that masonry which erects the abodes\r\nfamiliar to every eye, though the execution may not be familiar to\r\nmany minds. The second chapter contains an account of the eggs,\r\nlarvæ pupæs; and here other marvels are unfolded. In the ants nest\r\nare males whose sole business is to perpetuate the species and die;\r\nfemales who are waited upon like peeresses in their own right, who\r\nneither toil nor spin, but are served by neutrals, labourers, who\r\ntend their innumerable eggs, nourish and unfold the larvæ, and in\r\nshort, do all the duties of mothers, nurses, and menials. The author\r\ndevised means to observe their internal economy; and he says--\r\n\r\n\"Let us now open the shutter which conceals from us the interior of\r\nthe ant hill, and let us see what is passing there.\r\n\r\n\"Here the pupæ are heaped up by hundreds in their spacious lodges;\r\nthere the larvæ are collected together, and guarded by workers.\r\nIn one place, we observe an assemblage of eggs, in another place,\r\nsome of the workers seem occupied in following an ant of larger\r\nsize than the rest;--this is the mother, or at least one of the\r\nfemales, for there are always several in each ant-hill:--she lays\r\nas she walks, and the guardians, by whom she is surrounded, take\r\nup her eggs, or seize them at the very moment of her laying them;\r\nthey collect them together, and carry them in little heaps in their\r\nmouths.[2] On looking a little closer, we find that they turn them\r\ncontinually with their tongues; it even appears, they pass them one\r\nafter the other between their teeth, and thus keep them constantly\r\nmoistened. Such is the first _apercu_ which my glazed aparatus\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n  [2] The eggs of ants are so remarkably minute, that there would seem\r\n  an absolute necessity of their being held together by some glutinous\r\n  matter, otherwise, it would render the removal of such small bodies\r\n  in the mandibles of ants almost impossible; the mandibles being so\r\n  constituted as not to be brought into that close contact necessary\r\n  for this operation.--T.\r\n\r\n\"Having directed my close attention to these eggs, I remarked they\r\nwere of different sizes, shades and forms. The smallest were white,\r\nopake, and cylindrical; the largest, transparent, and slightly\r\narched at both ends; those of a middle were semi-transparent. In\r\nholding them up to the light, I observed a sort of white oblong\r\ncloud; in some, a transparent point might be remarked at the\r\nsuperior extremity; in others, a clear zone above and underneath\r\nthe little cloud. The largest presented a single opake and whitish\r\npoint in their interior. There were some whose whole body was so\r\nremarkably clear as to allow of my observing very distinctly the\r\nrings. In fixing my attention more closely upon the latter, I\r\nobserved the egg open, and the larva appear in its place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been enabled to observe through the glasses of my artificial\r\nant-hill, the great care taken of these little worms, which bear\r\nalso the name of Larvæ. They were generally guarded by a body of\r\nants, who, raised upon their feet, with their abdomen brought\r\nbetween these members, were prepared to cast their venom upon all\r\nintruders, whilst here and there, other workers were engaged in\r\nclearing the passages, by removing the materials which were out of\r\nplace: a great number of their companions taking at the same time\r\ntheir repose, and appearing to be fast asleep: but a busy scene\r\noccurred at the moment of transporting their little ones to enjoy\r\nthe warmth of the sun. When the sun's rays fell upon the exterior\r\nportion of the nest, the ants, who were then on the surface,\r\ndescended with great rapidity to the bottom of the ant-hill, struck\r\nwith their antennæ the other ants, ran one after the other, and\r\njostled their companions, who mounted at the moment under the bell\r\nglass, and redescended with the same speed, putting in their turn\r\nthe whole colony in motion, so that we could observe a swarm of\r\nworkers, filling up all the passages; but what proved still more\r\ntheir intention by these movements, was, the violence with which the\r\nworkers sometimes seized, with their mandibles, those who did not\r\nappear to understand them, dragging them forth to the top of the\r\nant-hill, and immediately leaving them, to go and seek those still\r\nremaining with the young.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the ants had intimation of the appearance of the sun,\r\nthey occupied themselves with the larvæ and pupæ; they carried them\r\nwith all expedition above the ant-hill, where they left them exposed\r\nto the influence of the heat. Their ardour suffered no relaxation;\r\nthe female larvæ (which are heavier, and much larger than those of\r\nthe other cast) were carried passages, leading from the interior to\r\nthe exterior of the ant-hill, and placed in the sun, by the side of\r\nthose of the workers and males. After remaining there a quarter of\r\nan hour, the ants again took them up, and sheltered them from the\r\ndirect rays of the sun, by placing them in chambers, situated under\r\na layer of straw, which did not entirely intercept the heat.\r\n\r\nThe workers, after having fulfilled the duties imposed upon them\r\nin regard to the larvæ, did not forget themselves; they sought, in\r\ntheir turn, to stretch themselves in the sun, lay upon each other\r\nin heaps, and seemed to enjoy some repose, but it was of no long\r\nduration. I observed a great number constantly employed on the\r\nsurface of the ant-hill, and others engaged in carrying back the\r\nlarvæ, in proportion as the sun declined. The moment of nourishing\r\nthem being at length arrived, each ant approached a larva, and\r\noffered it food. \"The larvæ of ants,\" observes M. Latreille,\r\n\"resemble, when they quit the egg, little white worms destitute\r\nof feet, thick short, and in form almost conical; their body is\r\ncomposed of twelve rings: the anterior part is slender and curved.\r\nWe remark at the head two little horny pieces or hooks, too distant\r\nfrom each other to be regarded as true teeth; under these hooks\r\nwe observe four little points or _cils_, two on each side, and a\r\n_mamelon_, or tubercular process, almost cylindrical, soft, and\r\nretractile, by which the larva receives its food.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFATA MORGANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis singular and curious phenomenon, which is occasionally seen\r\nnear the Bay of Naples, and which is nearly allied to the _mirage_,\r\nso well known in the east, was observed in Huntingdonshire, during\r\nthe late hot weather. The sun was shining in a cloudless sky, and\r\nthe light vapours arising from the river Ouze, were hovering over\r\na little hill, near St. Noet's when suddenly the village of Great\r\nPaxton, its farm-houses, barns, dispersed cottages, and indeed the\r\nwhole of its beautiful and picturesque scenery were distinctly\r\nvisible in these vapours, forming a splendid aerial picture, which\r\nextended from east to west for several hundred yards. This natural\r\npanorama lasted for about ten minutes, and was visible from a\r\nneighbouring declivity, about half a mile from Great Paxton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDERS OF NATURE.--ENTOMOLOGY.\r\n\r\nORDER IV.--NEUROPTERA.\r\n\r\n    Thick in yon stream of light, a thousand ways,\r\n    Upward, and downward, thwarting, and convolved,\r\n    The quivering nations sport; till tempest winged,\r\n    Fierce Winter sweeps them from the face of day.\r\n    E'en so luxurious men unheeding pass\r\n    An idle summer life in fortune's shine,\r\n    A season's glitter! Thus they flutter on\r\n    From toy to toy, from vanity to vice;\r\n    Till blown away by death, oblivion comes\r\n    Behind, and strikes them from the book of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe neuroptera, or _nerve-winged_ insects, have four wings, which\r\nare membranaceous, naked, and so interspersed with delicate veins,\r\nthat they have the appearance of beautiful network. Their tail\r\nhas no sting; but that of the male is frequently furnished with\r\na kind of forceps or pincers. The genera are:--1. _Libellula_,\r\ndragon-fly.--2. _Ephemera_, May-fly, or trout-fly, &c.\r\n\r\nThe _libellula_, or dragon-fly, is an insect of very splendid and\r\nvariegated colours. It is a large and well known fly, and frequents\r\nrivers, lakes, pools, and stagnating waters, in which the females\r\ndeposit their eggs. The egg, when deposited by the parent in the\r\nwater, sinks to the bottom, and remains there till the young insect\r\nhas acquired sufficient maturity and strength to burst from its\r\nconfinement. The larva, at first small increases to nearly half the\r\nsize of the perfect fly, by changing its skin at different intervals\r\nlike the caterpillars of moths and butterflies. The appearance of\r\nthe little cases containing the rudiments of the wings, at the lower\r\nmargin of the thorax, denotes its change to the state of pupa. The\r\nhead of this larva is exceedingly singular, being covered with a\r\nmask extending over the whole of the fore part of the head, with\r\ncavities in the anterior surface to suit the different prominences\r\nof the face to which it is fitted with perfect neatness. Its form is\r\ntriangular, growing smaller towards the bottom: in the latter part\r\nthere is a knuckle which fits a cavity near the neck, and on this\r\npart it turns as on a pivot. The upper part of this mask is divided\r\ninto two pieces, which the insect can open or close at pleasure,\r\nand it can also let down the whole mask, should occasion require.\r\nThe inner edges of these two pieces are toothed like a saw, and\r\nserve the animal as a pair of forceps to seize and retain its prey.\r\nThis is the general principle on which these projecting forceps are\r\nconstructed in the larva of the libellulæ; they differ in shape in\r\nthe several species, but uniformly act in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nThese animals generally live and feed at the bottom of water,\r\nswimming only occasionally. Their motion in the water can scarcely\r\nbe called swimming; it is accomplished by sudden jerks repeated\r\nat intervals. This motion is not occasioned by their legs, which\r\nat this time are kept immoveable and close to the body: it is\r\nby forcing out a stream of water from the tail that the body is\r\ncarried forward, as may be easily perceived by placing them in a\r\nflat vessel, in which there is only just water enough to cover\r\nthe bottom. Here the action of the water squirted from their tail\r\nwill be very visible; it will occasion a small current, and give\r\nsensible motion to any light bodies that are lying on the surface.\r\nThis action can only be effected at intervals, because after each\r\nejaculation the insect is obliged to take a fresh supply of water.\r\nThe larva will sometimes turn its tail above the surface of the\r\nwater, and force out a small stream, as from a little fountain, and\r\nwith considerable force.\r\n\r\nUnder the same order is comprehended the _phryganea_, or spring-fly:\r\nthe caterpillars of this genus live in the water, and are covered\r\nwith a silken tube. They have a very singular aspect; for, by means\r\nof a gluten, they attach to the tubes in which they are enclosed\r\nsmall pieces of wood, sand, gravel, leaves of plants, and not\r\nunfrequently live on testaceous animals, all of which they drag\r\nalong with them. They are very commonly found on the leaves of the\r\nwater-cress; and, as they are often entirely covered with them, they\r\nhave the appearance of animated plants. They are in great request\r\namong fishermen, by whom they are distinguished by the name of stone\r\nor cod-bait. The fly, or perfect insect, frequents running water, in\r\nwhich the females deposit their eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEAP AND ELEGANT CARPETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of September, the Society for the encouragement of\r\nnational industry at Paris, granted to Mr. Chenavard, (Boulevard\r\nSt. Antoine, No. 65, Paris) the premium of 1200 francs, which\r\nhad been promised to the person who could manufacture, at the\r\nlowest price, the kind of carpet best calculated for low and damp\r\nhabitations. The most complete success in the making of this article\r\nrewarded the exertions of Mr. C. whose manufacturing ingenuity, in\r\na great variety of branches is well known, and who is particularly\r\ncelebrated for his rich and tasty _paper and stuff hangings_. Mr.\r\nC. has most satisfactorily fulfilled the proposed object of the\r\nsaid Society, and it is asserted impossible better to combine, in\r\nthat branch of industry, cheapness, elegance and solidity. The new\r\ninvented article is a sort of varnished felt, far superior to any\r\nthing of the kind that was ever manufactured in England, with which\r\nstone floors, marbles, mosaics, and even the finest carpets of\r\nPersia can be imitated. It is not dearer than the coarsest mats. A\r\nsquare foot of it may be purchased for 4 sols: so that the quantity\r\nwhich is necessary for a room 24 feet by 20, would amount to no more\r\nthan 48 francs, or about 9 dollars. 14 cents. Mr. C. is now giving\r\nhis attention to a new kind of winter carpet, which its cheapness\r\nand superior qualities will make a valuable acquisition to the\r\nlovers of comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Jacob's Travels.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF FLOWERS IN HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter passing through the small town of Liss, the road continued\r\nwith the sandhills in perfect barrenness till we approached that\r\ncity; whose entrance is decorated with country seats of considerable\r\nmagnificence and beautiful flower gardens which supply bulbs to the\r\nhorticulturists of their own country, as well as furnish the most\r\nbeautiful specimens of flowers to the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the cultivation of flower roots and seeds,\r\nindependent of the elegance of the pursuit, has by the profits it\r\nhas brought become an object of some importance. It is the source\r\nof prosperity to many respectable families, and in some measure\r\nlays all Europe under obligations which are repaid by profit to the\r\ncultivators. The number of flower-gardeners is not above twelve or\r\nthirteen, but the operations of each are very extensive. It is said,\r\nthat there are more than twenty acres of land devoted solely to the\r\ncultivation of hyacinths, and a large portion to tulips, and other\r\nflowers. These flowers are principally sold when in full bloom in\r\nAmsterdam, where there is a weekly market on Sunday afternoon, and\r\nthe whole of Monday; the trade, however, has vastly declined of late\r\nyears, having sunk in weekly returns from 15,000 to 3,000 florins.\r\nThe tulip mania which afflicted Holland in the years 1636 and 1637,\r\nand which involved so many families in ruin, has long ceased;\r\nbut in 1730, a hyacinth-mania, inferior to it indeed, but equally\r\nridiculous, prevailed: and speculations were made in those flowers\r\nto a considerable extent, so that some single bulbs were sold as\r\nhigh as sixty or seventy pounds. There can be no doubt but the taste\r\nfor cultivating flower gardens, which has extended itself over\r\nalmost the whole of Europe, may be traced to this country, which\r\nfurnishes bulbs and seeds till the intervention of successive wars\r\nand their interruptions to communication, induced the other nations\r\nto propagate those flowers at home, whose growth was most congenial\r\nto their soil and climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Lyman's \"Political State of Italy.\"\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO TWO NUNNERIES IN ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nI obtained permission to visit the nunnery called \"Tor di Specchio,\"\r\none of the richest and most respectable of Rome, having twenty-one\r\nnuns, great rents, and requiring one thousand eight hundred dollars\r\nof expenses for the ceremony of vestire. I was received in a room\r\njust beyond the grate in which the confessor of the convent, a red\r\nfaced, good natured looking man, was warming himself; a 'converse'\r\nspinning flax, and the sister whose duty it was to wait in the\r\nroom for the week. In the garden, great numbers of roses and other\r\nflowers were cultivated. I was led through several corridors, at\r\nthe end of each of which was placed an image of the Saviour or the\r\nVirgin, with a lamp burning before it. In the corridor of the second\r\nstory, the cells of the sisters were situated, each covered towards\r\nthe passage by a large green curtain. These cells looked into the\r\ngarden, and opposite each door in the corridor was placed a large\r\nstand of ashes, at which the nuns cooked their morning chocolate and\r\nwarmed themselves. The dining room was large, and the tables were\r\nwell covered with green baize. In the middle of the room there was\r\na pulpit, from which a sister read in turn religious works during\r\nthe meals, a practice which prevails in nearly all Roman convents;\r\nthe word \"Silentium,\" in large letters, was cut deep in a stone\r\nover the principal door. The kitchen was large, but dirty. In this\r\nnunnery there were three chapels, one church for summer and another\r\nfor winter. I was suffered to enter the cell of the superior, who\r\nreceived me with great courtesy. She was sitting upon a bed, that\r\nshe had not left for three years, spinning flax, and holding a large\r\nrosary in one hand. She was at that time eighty-three years of age,\r\nand had entered the convent at twelve for her education, which she\r\nhad never left since that hour, having been suffered to remain\r\nduring the French time. She spoke much, and with great vivacity.\r\nThere were six or seven straw bottomed chairs in her little cell,\r\na handsome, but old fashioned clock, a small wardrobe and a few\r\nreligious prints. In several cells, which happened to be open as\r\nI passed, I saw books, flowers in the windows--a harpsichord, a\r\nharp and some other musical instruments. In this convent, meat is\r\neaten four times a week, and the order of the day is as follows,\r\nmuch resembling that of all convents. In summer they get up at\r\nfive. Prayers last an hour and a half; breakfast at seven--prayer\r\ntill eight--prayers again at ten--dine at eleven--after dinner\r\nsleep--evening office at four--supper at six, and bed at eight. In\r\nthe intervals of meals and offices, the sisters read pious books,\r\ntalk, walk, embroider, tear lint for hospitals, or do coarse work.\r\nThey confess themselves and take the sacrament every eight days;\r\nthey confess themselves to a priest named by the head of the order;\r\nhe is changed several times a year. The person, who conducted me,\r\nwas a princess of a Roma family. She had taken the veil twenty-one\r\nyears ago, but possessed perfect ease, simplicity and courtesy. She\r\nspoke of those matters, which are always subjects of conversation\r\nin drawing rooms of antiquities, carnivals, deaths of queens, &c.\r\nHer dress was coarse black, and by no means neat. She was perfectly\r\naffable, and answered with great complaisance numerous troublesome\r\nquestions. Indeed, there was not the slightest tinge of gloom, or\r\nsolitude, or austerity about this convent, or in the appearance and\r\nmanners of the few nuns, whom I happened to see. I recollect hearing\r\nan aged Roman lady, who possessed a vast experience in courts,\r\nconvents, drawing-rooms, boudoirs, and of every thing else which\r\nrelates to the world, remark some time after that of all creatures\r\nshe had ever seen, the most amiable in their manners, and good\r\nnatured, were nuns.\r\n\r\n_Vive Seppolte._--As its name denotes, the nuns of this convent\r\nnever see the face of any human being but of the inmates of it. They\r\nconfess themselves to a confessor through a brass plate, pierced\r\nwith small holes; they are allowed to hold converse with their\r\nfriends only once a year, through a similar plate. No window or\r\nany kind of opening looks upon a street or any sort of building;\r\nall the light comes from their own courtyard. They wear woollen\r\nnext their skin, which is changed only once a month, sleep in their\r\nclothes upon straw, and wear pieces of leather tied about their\r\nfeet. At the restoration of the pope all returned, excepting one,\r\nwho went to a similar convent at Albano. They have now fifty-four\r\nnuns, and one of them unluckily possesses a large fortune. No\r\nconvent in Rome receives such abundant charity. At the head of the\r\nstaircase, leading to this nunnery, a large solid barrel, girt\r\nwith iron, and divided into eight parts, is fixed into the thick\r\nwall of the building, and made to turn, so that articles may be\r\nconveyed from and into the convent. We knocked upon this wall and\r\nimmediately a voice answered from within, \"Praise be to our Lord\r\nJesus Christ,\" and said, \"what come ye to seek?\" We desired to speak\r\nwith the abbess. Whereupon the invisible rung a bell, and turning\r\nthe barrel, a key was brought to our view, that was taken by a man,\r\nwho had appeared at the ringing, and who unlocked the \"parlatoire,\"\r\na small room, in one corner of which was a plate of copper, twelve\r\nor fourteen inches square, fixed in the wall, and pierced with the\r\nfinest holes imaginable.\r\n\r\nThe abbess now spoke to us from the other side of the plate, \"I\r\nsalute you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" This person had a\r\nlively voice and cheerful manner, and she spoke with perfect freedom\r\nand willingness about her own concerns and those of the convent. She\r\ntold us that she had taken the veil thirty-eight years ago, and had\r\nbeen made abbess at the restoration. She said moreover, that the\r\nsisters were happy, enjoyed good health, and that she had never seen\r\na dissatisfied look, or heard a repentant wish. This was no doubt\r\ntrue; people are contented in many conditions worse than that of\r\nthe Vive Seppolte, and conditions, too, which they never regard as\r\nprobations or martyrdoms, to be rewarded in another world. In 1815\r\nthe Pope had permitted this convent to be re-established, and since\r\nthat time not a human face, beyond those of the sisterhood, had\r\nbeen seen by any inhabitants of it. Judging from the sound of this\r\nwoman's voice, and her rapid, pleasant, and animated conversation,\r\nit is evident that she had neither regretted nor suffered much\r\nfrom this deprivation. She appeared to have vast vivacity, and\r\nmuch playfulness of mind, and was a great talker. Still it did\r\nnot often befal her to speak to foreigners through the grate, and\r\nmuch allowance ought to be made for the excitement which a similar\r\nsituation doubtless awakened. When a small tribute was turned upon\r\nthe barrel into the convent, she said \"God has sent us this gift.\"\r\n\"Those, who sent it, will be remembered in our prayers.\"\r\n\r\nHaving seen and heard much of the convents of Rome, I am satisfied\r\nthat the inhabitants of them do not condemn themselves to many\r\ndeprivations and mortifications, which they would not have suffered\r\nin the ordinary chances of a different life; that the passions,\r\nwhich exist there, are less active, violent and frequent, and that\r\nthe carelessness of mind, health of body, and absence from all gloom\r\nand severity, utterly contradict and put to shame the theories\r\nand creeds of the world. One cannot discourse too long upon the\r\nimpossibility of ascertaining the relative amount of happiness\r\nin the different courses of life to which habit, inclination, or\r\nchance, may call. A foreign gentleman, who had lived twenty years in\r\nRome, told me that he had never heard of any scandalous conduct in\r\nany nunnery during all that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Journal of Science.\r\n\r\nANTISEPTIC POWER OF THE PYROLIGNEOUS ACID.\r\n\r\n\r\nResults of some experiments made by Mr. W. Ramsay.--\r\n\r\nA number of herrings were cleaned on the 10th of July, 1819; and\r\nwithout being salted, were immersed for three hours in distilled\r\npyroligneous acid, specified gravity 1012. When withdrawn they were\r\nsoftened and not so firm as fish taken out of common pickle. They\r\nwere hung up in the shade; July and August were hot months, but the\r\nherrings had no signs of putrefaction about them, but had a very\r\nwholesome smell, combined with that of the acid. One being broiled\r\nthe empyreumatic smell was very strong. The rest, after six months,\r\nwere in complete preservation.\r\n\r\nIt was afterwards found that the period of immersion had been\r\ntoo long. If the fish are simply dipped in acid of specific\r\ngravity 1012, and dried in the shade, it is sufficient for their\r\npreservation; and such herrings, when boiled, are very agreeable and\r\nhave not the disagreeable empyreuma of the former.\r\n\r\nA number of haddocks were cleaned, split, and slightly sprinkled\r\nwith salt for six hours; then being drained, dipped for about three\r\nseconds in pyroligneous acid, and hung in the shade for eight\r\ndays. On being broiled, they were of an uncommonly fine flavour,\r\ndelicately white, and equal to the highly esteemed Finnan Haddock.\r\n\r\nHerrings were cured in the same way as the haddocks. After being\r\ndried in the shade for two months, they were equal in quality and\r\nflavour to the best red herrings. The fish retained the shining and\r\nfresh appearance they had when taken from the sea.\r\n\r\nA piece of fresh beef was dipped for one minute in pyroligneous acid\r\nof specific gravity 1012, in July 1819. On March 4, 1820, it was as\r\nfree from taint as when first immersed. No salt was used in this\r\nexperiment. A piece of beef was dipped in at the same time in pure\r\nvinegar, of specific gravity 1009. It was perfectly free from taint\r\non the 18th of November. This experiment indicates antiseptic powers\r\nin pure vinegar; some haddocks were cured with it, which remained\r\nfree from taint, but when cooked had an insipid taste.\r\n\r\nWhen beef is partially salted, and then steeped for a short time in\r\nthe pyroligneous acid, after being drained and cooked, it has the\r\nsame flavor as Hamburg beef.\r\n\r\nMr. Ramsay has no doubt, that with proper modifications, the use of\r\nthe acid may be extended to the preservation of every species of\r\nanimal food.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain whether the volatile oil in the pyroligneous\r\nacid, or the acid itself, was the agent to prevent putrefaction,\r\nMr. Ramsay dipped haddocks and fresh beef in pure vinegar of\r\nspecific gravity 1009. When fish were allowed to remain in the\r\nvinegar a few minutes, he observed that the muscular fibre was\r\nimmediately acted on, a partial solution of the fish took place, and\r\nthe acid became milky. When vinegar of a stronger quality was used,\r\nthe fish was entirely dissolved, particularly if aided by heat. Both\r\nfish and beef which were dipped in vinegar, of specific gravity\r\n1009, and which were afterwards dried in a summer heat, remained for\r\na long time after perfectly free from taint.\r\n\r\nMr. Stodart has repeated some of these experiments, and especially\r\nthose relating to the haddocks, with perfect success in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following plan for preparing cheap and nutricious food,\r\nreceived from a friend in England, was about a year ago extensively\r\ncirculated in this country, by means of several of the daily\r\njournals. Whether its utility, has to any considerable extent, been\r\ntested by practice is unknown to the writer; but as it is believed\r\nto be worthy of preservation, and as economy should still continue\r\nto be the order of the day, its republication may possibly be useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEAP, WHOLESOME, AND SAVORY FOOD.\r\n\r\nTake one pound of RICE, steep it in cold water for at least one\r\nhour, (longer would be better;) then put it into boiling water, and,\r\nif previously steeped enough, it will be sufficiently boiled in\r\nabout five minutes; then pour off the water, and dry it on the fire,\r\nas in cooking potatoes.\r\n\r\nUse it with the following gravy or sauce: two or three ounces of\r\nmutton suet, fried with onions until done enough; then add some\r\nflour and water, (as in making gravy,) with salt and about as much\r\nCayenne pepper, as will lie on a sixpence, (or twelve and a half\r\ncent piece;) the different ingredients, however, may be varied to\r\nthe taste.\r\n\r\nAt the present wholesale prices of RICE, the above would only cost\r\nabout three pence, (a fraction more than _five and a half cents_,)\r\nand would be sufficient meal for _a family of six persons_.\r\n\r\nI will merely add, that having eaten of the food prepared in exact\r\nconformity with the foregoing directions, it was found by no means\r\nunpalatable.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGINGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this root is nearly similar to that of potatoes.\r\nThe land is first well cleansed from weeds; it is then dug into\r\ntrenches similar to those which gardeners, make for celery; and the\r\nplants are set in these trenches in March or April. They flower\r\nabout September and in January or February; when the stalks are\r\nwithered, the roots are in a proper state to be dug up.--These are\r\nprepared for use in two ways. When intended for what is called\r\n_white ginger_, they are picked, scraped, separately washed, and\r\nafterwards dried with great care by exposure in the sun. For _black\r\nginger_, they are picked, cleansed, immersed in boiling water and\r\ndried. This process is much less laborious and expensive than the\r\nother; consequently the price of the article is not so great. By\r\nboiling, the ginger loses a portion of its essential oil, and its\r\nblack colour is owing to this.\r\n\r\nThe use of ginger, both in medicine, and as a spice, are numerous\r\nand well known. In the West Indies, it is frequently eaten fresh\r\nin sallads, and with other food, and the roots when dug up young,\r\nnamely, at the end of three or four months after they have been\r\nplanted, are preserved in syrup, and exported as a sweet meat to\r\nnearly all parts of the world. The ginger brought from the East\r\nIndies is much stronger than that coming from Jamaica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARS OF THE ANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The guard or sentry of the ant-hill will furnish us with the first\r\nproof of their social relations. We could, without doubt, irritate\r\nants on the surface of the nest, without alarming those in the\r\ninterior, if they acted isolately, and had no means of communicating\r\ntheir mutual impressions. Those who are occupied at the bottom of\r\ntheir nest, removed from the scene of danger, ignorant of what\r\nmenaces their companions, could not arrive to their assistance;\r\nbut it appears, that they are quickly and well informed of what is\r\npassing on the exterior. When we attack those without, the most\r\npart engage in their defence with a considerable degree of courage;\r\nthere are always some, who immediately steal off and produce alarm\r\nthroughout their city; the news is communicated from quarter to\r\nquarter, and the labourers come forward in a crowd, with every mark\r\nof uneasiness and anger. What however, is highly worthy our remark\r\nis that the ants, to whose charge the young are confided, and who\r\ninhabit the upper stories, where the temperature is highest, warned\r\nalso of the impending danger, always governed by that extreme\r\nsolicitude for their charge, which we have so often admired, hasten\r\nto convey them to the deepest part of their habitation, and thus\r\ndeposit them in a place of safety.\r\n\r\n\"To study in detail the manner in which this alarm spreads over the\r\nant-hill, we must extend our observations to the individuals of\r\nthe largest species: the Herculean Ants, who inhabit hollow trees\r\nand who quit them only in the spring, to accompany the males and\r\nfemales, have very much assisted me in this object.\r\n\r\n\"The labourers are from five to six lines in length; the winged\r\nindividuals are also proportionally large; they may be frequently\r\nseen running about the trunk of an oak, at the entrance of their\r\nlabyrinths. When I disturbed those ants that were at the greatest\r\ndistance from their companions, by either observing them too\r\nclosely, or blowing upon them lightly, I saw them run towards the\r\nother ants, give them gentle blows with their heads against the\r\ncorslet, communicating to them in this way, their fear or anger,\r\npassing rapidly from one to the other in a semicircular direction,\r\nand striking several times successively against those who did not\r\nput themselves in instant motion. These, warned of their common\r\ndanger, set off immediately, describing in their turn different\r\ncurves, and stopping to strike with their heads all those they met\r\non their passage. In one moment the signal was general, all the\r\nlabourers ran over the surface of the tree with great agitation,\r\nthose within receiving notice of the danger, and probably by the\r\nsame means, came out in a crowd and joined this tumult. The same\r\nsignal which produced upon the workers this effect, caused a\r\ndifferent impression upon the males and females; as soon as one of\r\nthe labourers had informed them of their danger, they sought an\r\nasylum, and re-entered precipitately the trunk of the tree;--not one\r\nthought of quitting its temporary shelter, until a worker approached\r\nand gave them the signal for flight. The solicitude of the labourers\r\nin their favour, is manifested in the activity they display, in\r\ngiving them advice or intimating to them the order for their\r\ndeparture; they redouble then the above signals, as if conscious of\r\ntheir understanding their intent less readily than the companions\r\nof their labours; the latter understand them, if I may use the\r\nexpression, at half a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of all the enemies of the ant, those most dreaded are the ants\r\nthemselves; the smallest not the least, since several fasten\r\nat once upon the feet of the largest, drag them to the ground,\r\nembarrass their movements, and thus prevent their escape. One would\r\nbe astonished at the fury of these insects in their combats; it\r\nwould be more easy to tear away their limbs and cut them to pieces,\r\nthan compel them to quit their hold. It is nothing uncommon to see\r\nthe head of an ant suspended to the legs or antennæ of some worker,\r\nwho bears about, in every place, this pledge of his victory. We\r\nalso observe, not unfrequently, the ants dragging after them the\r\nentire body of some enemy they had killed some time before, fastened\r\nto their feet in such a way as not to allow of their disengaging\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing the ants to be of equal size, those furnished with a\r\nsting have an advantage over those who employ only for their defence\r\ntheir venom and their teeth. The whole of those ants whose peduncles\r\nhas no scale, but one or two knots, are provided with a sting;\r\nthe Red Ants, which are said to sting more sharply than the rest,\r\npossess both these sorts of arms. In general the ants furnished with\r\na sting are, in our country, some of the smallest. I know but one\r\nspecies of middle size; but it is very rare and only inhabits the\r\nAlps.\r\n\r\n\"The wars entered into by ants of different size bear no resemblance\r\nto those in which ants engage who come to combat with an equal\r\nforce. When the large attack the small, they appear to do it by\r\nsurprise, most likely to prevent the latter from fastening upon\r\ntheir legs; they seize them in the upper part of the body and\r\nstrangle them immediately between their pincers. But when the small\r\nants have time to guard against an attack, they intimate to their\r\ncompanions the danger with which they are threatened, when the\r\nlatter arrive in crowds to their assistance. I have witnessed a\r\nbattle between the Herculean and the Sanguine Ants; the Herculean\r\nAnts quitted the trunk of the tree in which they had established\r\ntheir abode, and arrived to the very gates of the dwelling of the\r\nSanguine Ants; the latter, only half the size of their adversaries,\r\nhad the advantage in point of number; they however acted on the\r\ndefensive. The earth, strewed with the dead bodies of their\r\ncompatriots, bore witness they had suffered the greatest carnage;\r\nthey therefore, took the prudent part of fixing their habitation\r\nelsewhere, and with great activity transported to a distance of\r\nfifty feet from the spot, their companions, and the several objects\r\nthat interested them. Small detachments of the workers were posted\r\nat little distances from the nest, apparently placed there to\r\ncover the march of the retreats and to preserve the city itself\r\nfrom any sudden attack. They struck against each other when they\r\nmet, and had always their mandibles separated in the attitude of\r\ndefiance. As soon as the Herculean Ants approached their camp,\r\nthe centinals in front assailed them with fury; they fought at\r\nfirst in single combat. The Sanguine Ant threw himself upon the\r\nHerculean Ant, fastened upon its head, turned its abdomen against\r\nthe chest of its adversary or against the lower part of its mouth,\r\nand inundated it with venom. It sometimes quitted its antagonist\r\nwith great quickness: more frequently, however, the Herculean Ant\r\nheld between its feet its audacious enemy. The two champions then\r\nrolled themselves in the dust and struggled violently. The advantage\r\nwas at first in favour of the largest ant; but its adversary was\r\nsoon assisted by those of its own party who collected around the\r\nHerculean Ant and inflicted several deep wounds with their teeth.\r\nThe Herculean Ant yielded to numbers[3]; it either perished the\r\nvictim of its temerity, or was conducted a prisoner to the enemy's\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n  [3] I retained in close captivity in the same box nearly a month,\r\n  about an equal number of Red and Yellow Ants. It would seem that a\r\n  general feeling of compassion for their unfortunate imprisonment\r\n  had given birth to a suspension of hostilities, and that rankling\r\n  animosity had been exchanged for good will and social order.\r\n  During this period I seldom witnessed any affray on the exterior\r\n  of the nest, and on breaking it up, the interior gave me no room\r\n  to suppose it had been the scene of much contention; but scarcely\r\n  were they liberated, scarcely did they feel the fresh breeze passing\r\n  over them, than their animosity rekindled, and the field of their\r\n  liberty became the theatre of sanguinary combat. For a few moments\r\n  each party seemed engaged in discovering a place of retreat, and\r\n  it was only on returning to the ruins of their original prison, to\r\n  bring off the rest of their companions, that they encountered and\r\n  waged war upon each other. What was as singular as unexpected, they\r\n  fought in pairs, in no one instance _en masse_; indeed, it only\r\n  twice happened, although the ground was strewed with combatants,\r\n  that a third came to the aid of its companion, and even then, as if\r\n  conscious of the unequal contest, one immediately retired. It was\r\n  inconceivable with what desperate fury, and with what determined\r\n  obstinacy they fastened upon each other. With their mandibles alone\r\n  they often succeeded in effecting a complete separation of the body\r\n  of their antagonist, of which the ground exhibited many proofs when\r\n  I revisited it.\r\n\r\n  T.\r\n\r\n\"Such are the combats between ants of different size; but if we wish\r\nto behold regular armies war in all its form, we must visit those\r\nforests in which the Fallow Ants establish their dominion over every\r\ninsect in their territory. We shall there see populous and rival\r\ncities, regular roads passing from the ant hill as so many rays from\r\na centre, and frequently by an immense number of combatants, wars\r\nbetween hordes of the same species for they are naturally enemies\r\nand jealous of the territory which borders their own capital. It\r\nis in these forests I have witnessed the inhabitants of two large\r\nant-hills engaged in spirited combat. I cannot pretend to say what\r\noccasioned discord between these republics. They were composed of\r\nants of the same species, alike in their extent and population; and\r\nwere situated about a hundred paces distance from each other. Two\r\nempires could not possess a greater number of combatants.\r\n\r\n\"Let us figure to ourselves this prodigious crowd of insects\r\ncovering the ground lying between these two ant-hills, and occupying\r\na space of two feet in breadth. Both armies met at half-way from\r\ntheir respective habitations, and there the battle commenced.\r\nThousands of ants took their station upon the highest ground, and\r\nfought in pairs, keeping firm hold of their antagonists by their\r\nmandibles; a considerable number were engaged in the attack and\r\nleading away prisoners. The latter made several ineffectual efforts\r\nto escape, as if aware that, upon their arrival at the camp, they\r\nwould experience a cruel death. The scene of warfare occupied a\r\nspace of about three feet square; a penetrating odour exhaled from\r\nall sides; numbers of dead ants were seen covered with venom. Those\r\nants composing groups and chains, took hold of each other's legs and\r\npincers, and dragged their antagonists on the ground. These groups\r\nformed successively. The fight usually commenced between two ants,\r\nwho seized each other by the mandibles, and raised themselves upon\r\ntheir hind legs, to allow of their bringing their abdomen forward,\r\nand spirting the venom upon their adversary. They were frequently\r\nso closely wedged together that they fell upon their sides, and\r\nfought a long time in that situation, in the dust; they shortly\r\nafter raised themselves, when each began dragging its adversary;\r\nbut when their force was equal, the wrestlers remained immoveable,\r\nand fixed each other to the ground, until a third came to decide\r\nthe contest. It more commonly happened that both ants received\r\nassistance at the same time, when the whole four, keeping firm hold\r\nof a foot or antenna, made ineffectual attempts to gain the battle.\r\nSome ants joined the latter, and these were, in their turn seized\r\nby new arrivals. It was in this way they formed chains of six,\r\neight, or ten ants, all firmly locked together; the equilibrium was\r\nonly broken when several warriors, from the same republic, advanced\r\nat the same time, who compelled those that were enchained to let\r\ngo their hold, when the single combats again took place. On the\r\napproach of night each party returned gradually to the city, which\r\nserved it for an asylum. The ants, which were either killed or led\r\naway into captivity, not being replaced by others, the number of\r\ncombatants diminished, until their force was exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"The ants returned to the field of battle before dawn. The groups\r\nagain formed; the carnage recommenced with greater fury than on the\r\npreceding evening, and the scene of combat occupied a space of six\r\nfeet in length, by two, in breadth. Success was for a long time\r\ndoubtful; about mid-day the contending armies had removed to the\r\ndistance of a dozen feet from one of their cities, whence I conclude\r\nsome ground had been gained. The ants fought so desperately, that\r\nnothing could withdraw them from their enterprize; they did not\r\neven perceive my presence, and although I remained close to the\r\narmy, none of them climbed upon my legs; they seemed absorbed in one\r\nobject, that of finding an enemy to contend with.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all transparent substances, none can be compared to the\r\nbrilliancy of the diamond; and its hardness is such, that no kind of\r\nsteel instrument can make any impression upon it. Notwithstanding\r\nwhich, it has been proved that the diamond is but carbon or\r\ncharcoal, in a pure or chrystallized state. When strongly heated,\r\nit consumes entirely away. Diamonds, when rubbed together, have a\r\npeculiarly, and scarcely to be described grating sound, which is\r\nremarkably characteristic of this gem; so that by this circumstance\r\nalone, rough diamonds may be accurately and expeditiously\r\ndistinguished from every other gem. When the diamond is rubbed,\r\nit will attract bits of straw, feathers, hairs, and other small\r\nobjects, and if exposed to the rays of the sun, and immediately\r\ntaken into a dark place, will appear luminous.\r\n\r\nThe largest diamond ever known, is in the possession of the Queen of\r\nPortugal, and weighs about eleven ounces. It was found in Brazil,\r\nand sent from thence to London, in the year 1746. It is still uncut,\r\nand has been valued at twenty-five million six hundred thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nDiamonds are much worn in England as ornaments. When converted into\r\npowder or dust, the diamond is used with steel instruments to divide\r\npebbles and precious stones. Its use in cutting glass is generally\r\nknown. Rock crystal, brought from Brazil, is divided into leaves,\r\nand ground and polished with diamond dust for spectacles, and other\r\noptical instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM WIRT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Excessive wealth is neither glory nor happiness. The cold and\r\nsordid wretch, who thinks only of himself; who draws his head within\r\nhis shell and never puts it out, but for the purposes of lucre and\r\nostentation--who looks upon his fellow creatures not only without\r\nsympathy, but with arrogance and insolence, as if they were made\r\nto be his vassals, and he was made to be their lord--as if they\r\nwere formed for no other purpose than to pamper his avarice, or to\r\ncontribute to his aggrandizement--such a man may be rich, but trust\r\nme, that he can never be happy, nor virtuous, nor great. There is in\r\nfortune a golden mean, which is the appropriate region of virtue\r\nand intelligence. Be content with that; and if the horn of plenty\r\noverflow, let its droppings fall upon your fellow men; let them\r\nfall, like the droppings of honey in the wilderness, to cheer the\r\nfaint and wayworn pilgrim. I wish you indeed to be distinguished;\r\nbut wealth is not essential to distinction. Look at the illustrious\r\npatriots, philosophers and philanthropists, who in various ages have\r\nblessed the world; was it their wealth that made them great? Where\r\nwas the wealth of Aristides, Socrates, of Plato, of Epaminondas,\r\nof Fabricius, of Cincinnatus, and a countless host upon the rolls\r\nof fame. Their wealth was in the mind and the heart. Those are the\r\ntreasures by which they have been immortalized, and such alone are\r\nthe treasures that are worth a serious struggle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE ADVANTAGES OF NARROW RESOURCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn minds of a certain cast, the title of this essay may possibly\r\nexcite surprise. It might be imagined that the writer was guided\r\nin the choice of a subject, as the Cynic was directed in his tub,\r\nby that misanthropy which affects to look on good and evil, with\r\nan equal frown; or by that pride which finding itself linked to\r\npoverty, strives to dignify the despised partner of its destiny.\r\nYet, in spite of these suggestions, much may be said in favour\r\nof those narrow resources, which the superficial view with pity,\r\nand the worldling with scorn. And further, the assertion may be\r\nhazarded, that they are favourable to individual character and\r\nhappiness, as well as to the general cause of literature and virtue.\r\n\r\nRepeated proofs of the first position, may be drawn from the common\r\nscenery of life.--Observe that boy, in the early stages of his\r\neducation.--Why does he destroy his books, and cast about him his\r\npens and his pencils? Why are his pages the repository of blots,\r\nand deformed with dogs-ears, and his volumes alternately his sport,\r\nand his footstool? Because he feels that his parents are able to\r\npurchase more. Why does he occasionally fix on their contents, a\r\nscowling eye, and the bent brow of discontent? Fear of present\r\ndiscipline, or a listless desire of winning the dainties and praises\r\nof parental indulgence, are forcing a reluctant attention to his\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nMark that boy at his side. Why does he so carefully use his scanty\r\nwriting materials, and so faithfully return his books to their\r\nplace, when his task is finished? Because he has learnt their value\r\nby the difficulty of obtaining them. Why does he pursue his studies\r\nwith unremitting application, yet with a cheerful countenance?\r\nBecause he considers it a privilege to be permitted to acquire\r\nknowledge, and his studies are but a recreation from severer\r\nlabours. His mind takes its pastime along with its nourishment,\r\nwhile his companion, like a prisoner, is only anxious to escape\r\nfrom durance. One, in toiling to gain instruction, feels himself\r\nthe indebted party: the other, if he ever submits to it, fancies\r\nhe has conferred a favour which entitles him to commendation and\r\nreward. This diversity of motive, will naturally produce diversity\r\nof action; and action, long continued, becomes confirmed into\r\nhabit. Time, while he palsies the springs of energy, and quenches\r\nthe ardour of thought, adds force to those habits, which indulgence\r\nhas fostered and nourished. And will it be supposed that habits of\r\ncarelessness, watchfulness, and mental indolence, continued through\r\nthe important period of school education, will have no influence on\r\nthe future character? Is the productiveness of Autumn, not affected\r\nby the poverty of the blossoms of Spring; or the future symmetry\r\nof the tree, uninjured by the excrescences of the sapling? No one\r\nimagines that early habits of industry, economy, and application,\r\nstamped on the character in its formation, will ever be wholly\r\nobliterated; why then, is that state of fortune considered as an\r\nevil, which aids their implantation by the strength of necessity?\r\n\r\nMark that student at the University. Why is he lounging in the\r\nfashionable walks, ogling the ladies, displaying an expensive dress,\r\ncontracting bills at the confectioner's and tailor's, late at\r\nprayers, listless at recitations, satisfied only in the resorts of\r\nfolly, vanity, and dissipation? Why does he return home, uninformed\r\nin mind, undecided in profession, tinctured with extravagance,\r\nor involved in debt? Because he knew his parents were rich, and\r\nbelieved that wealth was a substitute, both for science and for\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nWhy does a youth from the same neighbourhood, perhaps his inferior\r\nin talents, maintain the first standing in his class, and gain the\r\nhonours of his seminary? What heightens his love of knowledge,\r\nbrightens his eye with intelligence, incites him to mark every hour\r\nwith diligence, every day with duty; what enables him to scorn\r\nluxurious indulgence, and to endure privation with a noble hardiness\r\nof soul? The consciousness that his family are poor, and that by his\r\nown exertions he must stand or fall.\r\n\r\nThus excited to perseverance, he ascertains the extent of his own\r\ntalents, bends them to their proper objects, brightens them by\r\nexercise, and entrusts them \"to the usurer, that the Giver, at\r\nhis coming, may receive his own.\"--The indolent mind, weakened by\r\nindulgence, views knowledge as \"an austere man,\" and committing\r\nits talent to the earth, beholds its harvest in the mildew, the\r\nmouldering, and decay of its own powers.\r\n\r\nWhere a taste for literature exists, and the means of attaining\r\nit are not precluded, narrow resources are favourable to its\r\nacquisition. Would Johnson, the giant of English literature, have\r\ngained the proud eminence which he commands, without aid from the\r\nstrong hand of necessity? Did he not even express gratitude, that\r\nthe touch of adversity had been appointed to rouse him from the\r\nslumber of his native indolence? Is it probable that mankind would\r\nhave been delighted with the elegance of his \"Prince of Abyssinia,\"\r\nif affluence had enabled him to discharge the mournful debt of his\r\nmother's obsequies? Did not the classical Beattie trace his ardour\r\nof literary pursuit, and his premature proficiency to the stimulus\r\nof his bursary at Aberdeen? Did he not refer some of the most\r\ndescriptive stanzas in his \"Minstrel,\" to his state of seclusion\r\nand poverty, when a parish schoolmaster, and precentor, at the foot\r\nof the Grampian Mountains?--Would the Ayrshire ploughman's \"wild\r\nbird of heaven,\" have displayed such varying plumage, such fearless\r\ncompass of tone, had it been confined in a gilded cage, and pampered\r\nwith the enervating luxuries of fortune?\r\n\r\nWhatever enforces mental application, is favourable to mental\r\nimprovement; and nothing teaches the lesson of application more\r\nthoroughly than necessity. Whatever exercises the inventive powers,\r\nis favourable to genius, and necessity executes this office so\r\npowerfully, that it is styled even by the common people, \"the\r\nmother of invention.\" The affinity between restricted resources,\r\nand virtue, is of obvious perception. Habits of self-denial, and\r\nself-control, insensibly lead to moderated desires, and inspire that\r\ncontent which is the secret of happiness. A well-regulated mind, by\r\naccustoming itself to privation, and sacrifice, rises superior to\r\nselfish gratifications, and improves in that disinterested state of\r\nthe affections, which is one of the greatest objects of piety to\r\ncultivate.--The man, whose narrow possessions are the fruit of his\r\nown industry, will better understand their value, more studiously\r\navoid the vices that dissipate them, and more conscientiously limit\r\nhis expenses by his income.--Thus will he keep his spirit unhumbled\r\nby the embarrassments of debt, and his heart unchilled by dread at\r\nthe face of a creditor. Rational economy, while it supplies him\r\nwith the means of rendering every man his due, will prove also the\r\nlegitimate fountain of charity. Profusion is no friend to pity;\r\nand how can he have a right to be liberal, whose debts are unpaid.\r\nThe movings of Charity are silenced, by the \"cry of the labourers\r\nwhose wages are kept back;\" while he, whose industry has satisfied\r\nthe claims of justice, may make glad the hearts of theirs, while\r\nhis own reproaches him not. May we not suppose that the remembrance\r\nof having ourselves known want, would soften the feelings to the\r\nwants of others? as a participation in the sufferings of sickness,\r\ncreates deeper sympathy for the victims of disease? Who, with a\r\nwarmer overflowing of charity, would impart bread to the hungry, and\r\na garment to the shelterless, than the man, who had himself felt the\r\nneed of one, or by his own labour obtained possession of the other?\r\nA class of distresses, of which the rich can have no conception, he\r\nhas entered into; and in his humble gift there will be more charity,\r\nthan in the ample donations of Pride, listening to hear Fame extol\r\nher bounty. As the Israelites were incited to hospitality, by the\r\nremembrance that they had once \"been strangers in the land of\r\nEgypt,\" so the heart that has endured the privations of poverty, can\r\nbetter estimate, and more feelingly relieve them.\r\n\r\nIf the happiness of any condition be computed by its usefulness, by\r\nthe energies which it awakens, and the virtues which it cherishes,\r\nmay we not believe, that many in making up their account of life,\r\nwill have reason to bless the Almighty Disposer, that they were\r\nshielded by his providence from the enervating influence and the\r\ndangerous temptations of wealth.\r\n\r\n  [_Con. Mirror_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF MAMMOTH CAVE,\r\n\r\n_in Kentucky and a remarkable Mummy, or dried Indian woman found in\r\nit_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I received information, that an infant, of nine or twelve months\r\nold, was discovered in a saltpetre Cave in Warren county, about four\r\nmiles from the Mammoth Cave, in a perfect state of preservation. I\r\nhastened to the place; but, to my mortification, found that, upon\r\nits being exposed to the atmosphere, it had fallen into dust, and\r\nthat its remains, except the skull, with all its clothing, had been\r\nthrown into the furnace. I regretted this much, and promised the\r\nlabourers to reward them, if they would preserve the next subject\r\nfor me. About a month afterwards, the present one was discovered,\r\nand information given to our agent at the Mammoth Cave, who sent\r\nimmediately for it, and brought and placed it there, where it\r\nremained for twelve months. It appeared to be the exsiccated body of\r\na female. The account which I received of its discovery, was simply\r\nthis. It was found at the depth of about ten feet from the surface\r\nof the Cave, bedded in clay, strongly impregnated with nitre, placed\r\nin a sitting posture, incased in broad stones, standing on their\r\nedges, with a flat stone covering the whole. It was enveloped in\r\ncoarse clothes, (a specimen of which accompanied it) the whole\r\nwrapped in deer skins, the hair of which was shaved off in the\r\nmanner in which the Indians prepare them for market. Enclosed in the\r\nstone coffin, were the working utensils, beads, feathers, and other\r\nornaments of dress, which belonged to her. The body was in a state\r\nof much higher perfection, when first discovered, and continued so,\r\nas long as it remained in the Mammoth Cave, than it is at present,\r\nexcept the depredations committed on its arms and thighs by the\r\nrats, many of which inhabit the Cave. After it was brought to\r\nLexington, and become the subject of great curiosity, being much\r\nexposed to the atmosphere, it gradually began to decay, its muscles\r\nto contract, and the teeth to drop out, and much of its hair was\r\nplucked from its head by wanton visitants. As to the manner of its\r\nbeing embalmed, or whether the nitrous earth and atmosphere had a\r\ntendency to preserve it, must be left to the speculations of the\r\nlearned.\r\n\r\nThe Cave in which the Mummy was found, is not of great extent, not\r\nbeing more than three quarters of a mile in length; its surface,\r\ncovered with loose limestone, from four to six feet deep, before you\r\nenter the clay impregnated with nitre. It is of easy access, being\r\nabove twenty feet wide, and six feet high, at the mouth or entrance.\r\nIt is enlarged to about fifty feet wide, and ten feet high, almost\r\nas soon as you enter it. This place had evident marks of having\r\nonce been the residence of the aborigines of the country, from the\r\nquantity of ashes, and the remains of fuel, and torches made of the\r\nreed, &c. which were found in it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEIPT FOR MAKING ECONOMICAL BREAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeparate the bran and grosser part; from the flour; then take five\r\npounds of it (of 16 ounces) and boil them in four gallons and three\r\nquarters of water, so that when it is dissolved, there shall remain\r\nthree gallons and three quarters of glutinous water. With this knead\r\nfifty-six pounds of flour, adding salt and yeast, in the same manner\r\nand in the same proportion as for other bread. When the dough is\r\nready to be put into the oven, divide it into loaves and let it bake\r\nfor two hours and a half.\r\n\r\nIn this way the flour will imbibe three quarters of a gallon more of\r\nglutinous, than it would of simple water, and will yield not only\r\na more nutritive and substantial food, but likewise an increase\r\nof a fifth beyond the quantity of common bread, a saving of one\r\nday's consumption out of six. Upon this plan, fifty-six pounds of\r\nmeal will yield eighty-three pounds and a half of bread. When this\r\nis quite stale (baked since ten days) if it be put into the oven\r\nand left there for twenty minutes, it becomes fresh again, a very\r\nconvenient property in long sea voyages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD MADE OF RICE AND FLOUR MIXED.\r\n\r\n\r\nRice is an excellent substitute for wheat flour. The following\r\nreceipt for the mixture yields a solid and palatable bread.\r\n\r\nSoften well by a slow fire a pound of rice with three quarters of a\r\ngallon of water. When it has acquired a certain degree of heat, mix\r\nup with it, well, four pounds of flour, some salt and yeast, as in\r\nmaking common bread; knead it and put it near the fire to rise. This\r\nwill give eight pounds and a half of good bread. If the rice seems\r\nto require more water, add, for there are several qualities of rice\r\nwhich swell more than others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONAH'S GOURD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The bottle gourd, (_lagenaria_) grows in many parts of the world to\r\nnear six feet long, and two feet thick.\r\n\r\nThe rinds or shells are used by the negroes in the West India\r\nislands as bottles, holding from one pint to many gallons. Barham\r\nspeaks of one that hold nine gallons; and the Rev. Mr. Griffith\r\nHughes mentions them in his history of Barbadoes, as holding\r\ntwenty-two gallons. Sloane mentions one of these gourds as large as\r\nthe human body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The gourd called Vegetable Marrow, is of a pale yellow colour.\r\nThose I have seen did not exceed from seven to nine inches in\r\nlength. It has only been known a few years in this country; and, I\r\nbelieve, was not sold in the shops and markets before the summer\r\nof 1819; and although they are of so late an introduction, the\r\naccounts are very imperfect: but it seems most probable that the\r\nseeds were brought in some East India ships, and likely from Persia,\r\nwhere it is called _cicader_. It is cultivated in the same manner\r\nas cucumbers, and is said by those who have grown them to be very\r\nproductive. This fruit is used for culinary purposes in every stage\r\nof its growth. When very young, it is good fried with butter; when\r\nhalf-grown, it is said to be excellent, either plainly boiled, and\r\nserved up sliced on toasted bread, as asparagus; or stewed with rice\r\nsauce, for which purpose it is likewise sliced. It is often sent to\r\ntable mashed like turnips: when full grown, it is used for pies. It\r\nhas been highly recommended to me by many persons who have grown it,\r\nwhile others speak of it as but little superior to the pompion.\"\r\n\r\nWe observe, from Galiffe, that the pumpkin is the principal food\r\nof the lower orders in Venice; and have no doubt but that it might\r\nbe very advantageously introduced into the messes of this country,\r\nbut for the prejudice against all innovations of this sort, and\r\nfor purposes of economy. All along the Danube too, the gourd and\r\nthe melon constitute, during their season, the daily meals of the\r\nlabouring classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROMPTER.--No. X.\r\n\r\n_It will do for the present._\r\n\r\n\r\nCustom, with an iron rod, rules four-fifths of mankind. My _father_\r\nplanted corn on a certain piece of land--it answered well--_I_ do\r\nthe same, though it does _not_ answer well. My neighbour such a one\r\ntells me that I had better try a change of crops, deep ploughing, or\r\nsowing turnips or clover; it may be the land will recruit; but my\r\nneighbour is notional, and fond of _new things_. _I_ do not like\r\nprojects. My father did so before me, and _it does for the present_.\r\n\r\nSo says the Virginia planter; he has raised tobacco on a field,\r\nuntil the soil is exhausted; he knows not how to fertilize the\r\nland again; his only resource is to clear a new spot, and take the\r\nbenefit of nature's manure. _This does for the present._ But when\r\nhis land is _all_ impoverished, what will he do? Go to Kentucky;\r\nas the New England men to Genesec. But when the western world is\r\nall peopled, what will our _do for the present folks_ do for good\r\nland? The answer is easy; necessity will compel them to use _common\r\nsense_; and common sense will soon make old poor land rich again.\r\nWhen farmers learn _to work it right_, they will keep it good, for\r\nthe Prompter ventures to assert, that a _proper tillage_ will for\r\never keep land good. How does nature _work it_? Why nature covers\r\nland with herbage; that herbage withers and rots upon the land; and\r\ngradually forms a rich black mould. But farmers, when they have used\r\nland till it will bear _no crops_, let it lie without feeding it. No\r\nherbage grows on the land, till the weeds and a little grass creep\r\nin by chance; after three or four years, the farmer ploughs it for a\r\ncrop, and has a job at killing weeds. Surely the man _does not work\r\nit right_; but he says, _it will do for the present_.\r\n\r\nBut no _body_ is so apt to put off things with, _it will do for\r\nthe present_, as _corporate bodies_. If the navigation of a river\r\nwants improvement, the _public body_, that is, _any body_, _every\r\nbody_, and _no body_, immediately exclaims, \"how did our _fathers_\r\nget along? The river did well enough for _them--it must do for the\r\npresent_.\" If a bad law exists, by which the _public money_ is to\r\nbe collected in the _worst manner_ that can be imagined; or if a\r\nconstitution is defective, in permitting the same men to be _makers_\r\nand _judges_ of a law; or the same men to rejudge a cause in a\r\n_higher_ court, which they have before judged in a _lower_ court;\r\nor which makes a legislature of two hundred men, a supreme court,\r\nto review the decisions of all inferior courts, and reverse their\r\njudgments; or if a constitution has _no executive at all_, and a\r\n_judiciary power_ dependent on the annual votes of two hundred men,\r\nwhich is little better than _none;_ I say, if a man proposes any\r\nreformation in those particulars, the public body says, away with\r\nyour _projects; let us go on in the good old way; it will do for\r\nthe present_. So in little public bodies, a town or a city, the\r\npoor must be provided for, bridges must be built, roads must be\r\nrepaired--How? By a tax, or by labour. Is it best to raise money\r\nenough this year to pay the town debt? No, says the town. We will\r\nraise _almost_ enough; _this will do for the present_. Let a little\r\ndebt accrue every year, till the whole will make a _shilling tax_,\r\nand pay the whole at once. Put off, put off, says the town. _And so\r\nsays the sinner._\r\n\r\nA bridge must be built. Is it best to build a good one; of stone,\r\nor some materials that will last? No, it will cost _more_, says the\r\ntown; a wooden bridge _will do for the present_. The water may carry\r\nit away; it will decay, and somebody may break his neck by the fall;\r\nbut no matter, _it must do for the present_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF CHARLES JAMES FOX.\r\n\r\n_By Sir James Macintosh_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Fox united, in a most remarkable degree, the seemingly\r\nrepugnant characters of the mildest of men, and the most vehement\r\nof orators. In private life he was gentle, modest, placable, kind,\r\nof simple manners, and so averse from dogmatism, as to be not only\r\nunostentatious, but even something inactive in conversation. His\r\nsuperiority was never felt but in the instruction which he imparted,\r\nor in the attention which his generous preference usually directed\r\nto the more obscure members of the company. The simplicity of his\r\nmanners was far from excluding that perfect urbanity and amenity\r\nwhich flowed still more from the mildness of his nature, than from\r\nfamiliar intercourse with the most polished society of Europe.\r\nThe pleasantry, perhaps, of no man of wit, had so unlaboured an\r\nappearance. It seemed rather to escape from his mind, than to be\r\nproduced by it. He had lived on the most intimate terms with all\r\nhis contemporaries distinguished by wit, politeness, or philosophy,\r\nor learning, or the talents of public life. In the course of thirty\r\nyears he had known almost every man in Europe, whose intercourse\r\ncould strengthen, or enrich, or polish the mind. His own literature\r\nwas various and elegant. In classical erudition, which by the custom\r\nof England is more peculiarly called learning, he was inferior to\r\nfew professed scholars. Like all men of genius, he delighted to take\r\nrefuge in poetry, from the vulgarity and irritation of business.\r\nHis own verses were easy and pleasant, and might have claimed no\r\nlow place among those which the French call _vers de société_. The\r\npoetical character of his mind was displayed by his extraordinary\r\npartiality for the poetry of the two most poetical nations, or\r\nat least languages of the west, those of the Greeks and of the\r\nItalians. He disliked political conversation, and never willingly\r\ntook any part in it.\r\n\r\nTo speak of him justly as an orator would require a long essay.\r\nEvery where natural, he carries into public something of that simple\r\nand negligent exterior which belonged to him in private. When he\r\nbegan to speak, a common observer, might have thought him awkward;\r\nand even a consummate judge could only have been struck with the\r\nexquisite justness of his ideas, and the transparent simplicity of\r\nhis manners. But no sooner had he spoken for some time than he\r\nwas changed into another being. He forgot himself and every thing\r\naround him. He thought only of his subject. His genius warmed and\r\nkindled as he went on. He darted fire into his audience. Torrents\r\nof impetuous eloquence swept along their feelings and convictions.\r\nHe certainly possesses above all moderns, that union of reason,\r\nsimplicity, and vehemence, which formed the prince of orators. He\r\nwas the most Demosthenian speaker since the days of Demosthenes. \"I\r\nknew him,\" says Mr. Burke, in a pamphlet written after their unhappy\r\ndifference, \"when he was nineteen; since which he has risen, by slow\r\ndegrees, to the most brilliant and accomplished debater the world\r\never saw.\"\r\n\r\nThe quiet dignity of a mind roused only by great objects, the\r\nabsence of petty bustle, the contempt of show, the abhorrence\r\nof intrigue, the plainness and down-rightness, and the thorough\r\ngood-nature which distinguished Mr. Fox, seem to render him no unfit\r\nrepresentative of the old English character, which, if it ever\r\nchanged, we should be sanguine indeed to expect to see it succeeded\r\nby a better. The simplicity of his character inspired confidence,\r\nthe ardour of his eloquence roused enthusiasm, and the gentleness\r\nof his manner invited friendship. \"I admired,\" says Mr. Gibbon,\r\nafter describing a day passed with him at Lausanne, \"the powers of a\r\nsuperior man, as they are blended in his attractive character, with\r\nall the softness and simplicity of a child; no human being was ever\r\nmore free from any taint of malignity, vanity, or falsehood.\"\r\n\r\nThe measures which he supported or opposed may divide the opinion\r\nof posterity, as they have divided those of the present age. But\r\nhe will most certainly command the unanimous reverence of future\r\ngenerations, by his pure sentiments towards the commonwealth, by his\r\nzeal for the civil and religious rights of all men, by his liberal\r\nprinciples, favourable to mild government, to the unfettered\r\nexercise of the human faculties, and the progressive civilization of\r\nmankind; by his ardent love for a country of which the well-being\r\nand greatness were, indeed, inseparable from his own glory; and by\r\nhis profound reverence for that free constitution, which he was\r\nuniversally admitted to understand better than any other man of his\r\nage, both in an actually legal, and in a comprehensive philosophical\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC LANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Washington City, Nov. 18._\r\n\r\nAn interesting document was transmitted by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to the Senate, in pursuance of a resolution of that house\r\nat the late Session, containing a body of information on the subject\r\nof the lands of the United States purchased from the Indians; the\r\nquantity sold; for how much sold, &c. &c. The sums which have been\r\npaid, and remain to be paid under Treaties made with the Indian\r\ntribes, to indemnify them for cessions of lands to the United\r\nStates is 2,542,916 dollars. The expense of surveying the Public\r\nLands, from 4th of March, 1789 to 31st December, 1819, has been\r\n4,243,632 dollars. The whole quantity of land which has been sold\r\nby the United states, as well before as since the opening of the\r\nLand Offices, up to, 30th September, 1819, is 20,138,482 acres;\r\nand the amount for which it has been sold is 45,098,696 dollars.\r\nOf this amount, 22,229,180 dollars had been paid, and 22,000,657\r\n_remained to be paid_, at the close of Sept. 1819. The quantity of\r\nlands surveyed in the several Land Office Districts is 72,805,092\r\nacres, whereof 13,601,930 acres have been sold, leaving 54,203,162\r\nacres unsold. The quantity surveyed for military bounty lands,\r\nis 12,315,360 acres. The whole quantity of land purchased from\r\nthe Indians by the various treaties and cessions is estimated at\r\n191,978,536 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extracts from the last Edinburgh Review._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lewis Burckhardt was a young Swiss, employed by the African\r\nAssociation to make discoveries in that country. He is recently\r\ndead; and the society are now publishing the result of his labours.\r\nThoroughly aware that a great part of the failures of African\r\ndiscoveries proceeded from their want of previous education in the\r\ncustoms, manners, and languages of the east, Mr. Burckhardt prepared\r\nhimself, by the study of Arabic, by a residence of six years in\r\nSyria and Egypt, by journies in Nubia, Palestine, in Arabia, and in\r\nthe countries between Egypt and the Red sea, for his great purpose\r\nof penetrating into the heart of Africa. His knowledge of Arabic and\r\nthe Koran, were so great, that after the severest examination by\r\ndoctors of the Mohammedan law, appointed for that express purpose\r\nby Mohammed Ali, pacha of Egypt, he was pronounced to be not only a\r\nreal, but a very learned Mohammedan. But as his skill in oriental\r\nmanners and languages improved, his constitution became impaired;\r\nand he became as last the victim of a tour in Arabia: dying better\r\nqualified than any traveller hitherto employed by the association\r\nfor the purpose of discovery in Africa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of his excursions were very unfortunate--twice, in spite of\r\nsolemn bargains with shekhs and high blooded Arabs, he is deserted\r\nand pillaged in the desert. In one of these instances, the robbers\r\nleave him nothing but his breeches. These he thought tolerably\r\nsecure; but he was not yet sufficiently acquainted with the manners\r\nand customs of the east. A female Arab met him with these breeches;\r\nand a very serious conflict for them ensued between the parties. The\r\nassociation have not stated the result.\r\n\r\n\"We are much struck by the perpetual miseries to which this\r\ntraveller is subjected. In all his journies, he seems kick'd and\r\ncuff'd by the whole party, and subjected to the grossest contempt\r\nand derision, for the appearance of poverty he always thought\r\nit prudent to assume. His system was, that the less display of\r\nwealth a man makes in the east the safer he is. This may be true\r\nenough in general; but when he travelled with a caravan containing\r\nmerchants who had ten or twelve camels, and twenty or thirty slaves\r\neach, he might surely have ventured on the display of one camel,\r\nand one or two slaves; for in one journey he travels upon an ass,\r\nwithout a slave; and in consequence his own wood to cut, his\r\nwater skins to fill, and his supper to dress. He receives as much\r\nrespect, therefore, as a man would do who was to rub down his own\r\nhorse in England; and is well nigh overpowered by the great and\r\nunnecessary fatigues to which this violent economy subjects him. We\r\ndo not remember that other travellers in Africa, proceeding with\r\ncaravans, have found it necessary to affect such an extreme state\r\nof pauperism; and Mr. Burckhardt himself admits, that Ali Bey, the\r\npretended Arabian, penetrated every where in the east by the very\r\nopposite system of magnificence and profusion, even though he was\r\nsuspected not to be a Mussulman by the natives themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"In his visit to the peninsula of Mount Sinai, Mr. Burckhardt meets\r\nwith a substance which he considers to be the same as the manna\r\nmentioned in the books of Moses.\r\n\r\n\"'A botanist would find a rich harvest in these high regions, in the\r\nmost elevated parts of which, a variety of sweet scented herbs grow.\r\nThe Bedouins collect to this day the manna, under the very same\r\ncircumstances described in the books of Moses. Whenever the rains\r\nhave been plentiful during the winter, it drops abundantly from the\r\ntamarisk (in Arabic, Tarfa;) a tree very common in the Syrian and\r\nArabian deserts, but producing, as far as I know, no manna any where\r\nelse. They gather it before sunrise, because, if left in the sun\r\nit melts; its taste is very sweet, much resembling honey; they use\r\nit as we do sugar, principally in their dishes composed of flour.\r\nWhen purified over the fire, it keeps for many months; the quantity\r\ncollected is inconsiderable, because it is exclusively the produce\r\nof the Tarfa, which tree is met with only in a few vallies at the\r\nfoot of the highest granite chain. The inhabitants of the peninsula,\r\namounting to almost four thousand, complain of the want of rain\r\nand of pasturage; the state of the country must therefore be much\r\naltered from what it was in the time of Moses, when all the tribes\r\nof Beni Israel found food here for their cattle.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTON-SEED OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of _Cotton-seed Oil_, is gaining attention, and\r\nobtaining investigations, both in Europe and America. It is a\r\nsubject highly important to the southern states. Millions of bushels\r\nof cotton seed are annually used as manure for corn, wheat, &c.\r\nin South Carolina. For this purpose the article is worth, at the\r\npresent reduced prices of staple commodities, about 12 or 15 cents\r\na bushel; weighing about 25 lbs. lightly thrown in. One hundred\r\npounds of cotton seed, yields about 27 pounds of clean cotton, and\r\nabout three bushels of seed. The oleaginous quality of the pulp of\r\ncotton-seed has long been known; and it is believed that any given\r\nquantity of it contains as much oil as a like quantity of the pulp\r\nof any other seed. As to its qualities, they are not all fully\r\ndeveloped; but considerable experience among leather-dressers in\r\nNorth Carolina, has proven it to be equal to any other oil for\r\ncurrying of leather for shoes, boots, harness, &c. Whether it can\r\nbe made to take the place of linseed oil, in painting, or of olive\r\nin manufactures, remains to be determined. The great difficulty\r\nattending the extracting of oil from cotton-seed, lies in the soft\r\nand spongy texture of the shell which encloses the pulp, which with\r\nthe short firbs of cotton adhering to it, absorbs a great portion\r\nof oil in the process. If the seed could be made to pass hastily\r\nthrough fire, by the operation of machinery, to divest it of the\r\nadhering cotton, then it seems probable that a machine somewhat\r\nsimilar to that made for hulling barley, would take off the shell\r\nor hull with great expedition. From all the light elicited on the\r\nsubject, it appears probable, that each bushel of seed might produce\r\na gallon of oil; and that the pulp, after the extraction of the\r\noil, would still be valuable for feeding cattle or for manure. For\r\nevery bale of cotton there might be produced about ten gallons of\r\noil: this, should the demand for oil continue, would be equal to\r\nhalf or two-thirds the value of the cotton.

If it be mixed with either\r\nof these substances, it immediately loses its viscidity, becomes\r\nhard, and is not at all liable to putrefaction. Further, if flower\r\nbe made into a paste, with solution of corrosive sublimate, it is\r\nimpossible to separate the gluten and starch in the usual way. This\r\neffect induced Dr. Taddei to suppose, that in cases of poisoning\r\nby corrosive sublimate, wheaten flour and gluten would prove\r\nexcellent antidotes to the poison. It was found by experiment, that\r\nwheaten flour and gluten, reduced corrosive sublimate to the state\r\nof calomel; and also that considerable quantities, of a mixture of\r\nflour or gluten with corrosive sublimate, might be eaten by animals\r\nwithout producing injury; thus fourteen grains of sublimate have\r\nbeen given in less than twelve hours to rabbits and poultry without\r\ninjury, whereas a single grain was sufficient to produce death when\r\nadministered alone. A grain of the sublimate required from twenty\r\nto twenty-five grains of fresh gluten to become innocuous; when dry\r\ngluten was used, half this quantity was sufficient, but when wheaten\r\nflour was taken, from fifteen to eighteen denari, (500 or 600 gr.,)\r\nwere required. Dr. Taddei recommends that dried gluten be kept in\r\nthe apothecaries' shops, and that it be administered when required,\r\nmixed with a little water.--_Giornale di Fisica_, 2. p. 375.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anecdote._--During the examinations of Surgeons for the army\r\nor navy, it is well known that the veterans of that respectable\r\nclass, question very minutely those who wish to become qualified.\r\nAfter answering very satisfactorily to the numerous inquiries made,\r\na young gentlemen was asked; if he wished to give his patient a\r\nprofuse perspiration, what he would prescribe? He mentioned many\r\ndiaphoretic medicines in case the first failed, and had some hopes\r\nthat he should pass with credit, but the unmerciful querist thus\r\ncontinued:-- \"Pray, sir, suppose none of those succeeded, what step\r\nwould you take next?\" \"Why, sir,\" rejoined the harassed son of\r\nEsculapius, \"I would send him here to be examined, and if _that_\r\nwould not give him a sweat, I know not what would.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cutting of Wheat before it is ripe._--It is said by a Paris paper\r\nthat grain cut eight days before the ordinary time, has, first,\r\nthe advantage of escaping the dangers which threatened it at that\r\nperiod. This is accidental, but it has the positive advantage of\r\nbeing more nutritive, larger, finer, and is never attacked by\r\nthe weasel. These assertions are proved by the most conclusive\r\nexperiments, made upon a piece of corn, half of which was cut\r\nprematurely, the other half at the customary time. The first part\r\ngave a hectolitre more corn for a half hectare. Afterwards an equal\r\nquantity of the farina was made into bread; that of the corn cut\r\nwhen green, made from six decalitres seven lbs. more bread than the\r\nother. Finally, the weasel attacked the corn cut when ripe, and the\r\nother was free from it. The moment to reap, is, when the grain,\r\nsqueezed between the fingers, appears pasty, like the crumb of bread\r\nimmediately after it is taken from the oven. This, which is the\r\nopinion of Mr. Cadet de Vaux, is supported by that of Mr. Mellard,\r\na very respectable agriculturist. They both confirm their theory by\r\nexperiments. The same custom has been practised for many years at\r\nthe magnificent farm of Mr. Coke, at Holkham, in England, who cuts\r\nnot only his grain before its maturity, but likewise grasses, and\r\neven herbaceous plants. He does not hesitate to attribute to this\r\nmeasure the superior quality of his corn and hay to that of other\r\nfarmers, who reap all things at the period of their perfect maturity.\r\n\r\n_Seduction._--A verdict of damages, to the amount of fourteen\r\nhundred and fifty dollars, was lately given in Ohio, in a case of\r\nseduction. This is \"paying dear for the whistle.\"\r\n\r\n_Milk and Water._--We have received a communication (says the N.\r\nY. Gazette,) from a very respectable source, giving an estimate of\r\nthe probable quantity of milk sold in New-York in one year, and\r\nthe quantity of water in the milk; by which it appears, that the\r\ncitizens of New York pay in one year the sum of $35,587 for water.\r\nOur correspondent's calculations follow. He supposes the city to\r\ncontain 120,000 inhabitants, 6 to a family--20,000 families, at\r\n3 cents worth of milk per day, is $600, or 219,000 for one year;\r\nto which is added one twelfth for strangers, &c. making $237,250.\r\nDeduct one fifteenth, or $35,587, which is annually paid for the\r\nWATER, with which the milk is reduced.--Our correspondent requests\r\nus to add, that he can prove the facts above stated, if called upon\r\nby the proper authority. He is himself an extensive dealer in milk,\r\nand is well acquainted with the management of most of those in his\r\nline.\r\n\r\n_Turkey Cement for joining Metals, Glass, &c._--The jewellers\r\nin Turkey, who are mostly Armenians, have a curious method of\r\nornamenting watch cases, and similar things with diamonds and other\r\nstones by simply gluing them on. The stone is set in silver or\r\ngold, and the lower part of the metal made flat, or to correspond\r\nwith the part to which it is to be fixed; it is then warmed gently\r\nand the glue applied, which is so very strong that the parts never\r\nseparate. This glue, which may be applied to many purposes, as it\r\nwill strongly join bits of glass or polished steel, is thus made:\r\n\r\nDissolve five or six bits of mastic, as large as peas, in as much\r\nspirits of wine as will suffice to render it liquid; in another\r\nvessel dissolve as much isinglass, which has been previously soaked\r\nin water till it is swollen and soft, in French brandy or in rum, as\r\nwill make two ounces, by measure, of strong glue, and add two small\r\nbits of gum galbanum, or ammoniacum, which must be rubbed or ground\r\nuntil they are dissolved; then mix the whole with a sufficient heat.\r\nKeep it in a phial stopped; and when it is used, set it in hot water.\r\n\r\n_Death of Col. Boon._--Col. Daniel Boon, the first white man that\r\never settled in Kentucky, lately died at his residence, near\r\nFranklin, Missouri, at the age of 98. He had 4 brothers and three\r\nsisters, of the following ages:--\r\n\r\nSamuel Boon 88, Jonathan B. 86, Squire B. 76, George B. 83, Mrs.\r\nWilcox 91, Mrs. Smith 83, and Mrs. Grant 84.\r\n\r\n_Council Bluffs._--A letter from Brigadier General Atkinson,\r\nstationed at Council Bluffs, states that at least 10,000 bushels of\r\nIndian corn, 4000 of potatoes, a like quantity of turnips, and about\r\n250 tons of hay had been raised and harvested at that station during\r\nthe last season. As a sample of the crop of Indian corn, an acre was\r\nmeasured, which gave upwards of 102 bushels. The turnip crop was\r\nmuch injured by the grasshoppers, and it is stated that if these\r\ninsects had appeared three weeks sooner they would have totally\r\ndestroyed the crop of corn. It would seem that they are often\r\nvery formidable in that quarter, frequently cutting off the crops\r\nentirely. The most of the Indians in that country are friendly.\r\nOne or two tribes however, indicate some signs of hostility. They\r\nwere much delighted with the exhibition of the steam boat, and as\r\nmuch intimidated by a display of the powers of the artillery, on an\r\noccasion when a large concourse of them were assembled at the Bluffs.\r\n\r\n_Double-jointed Indian._--A Detroit paper of November 10, says, a\r\nMr. Robinson lately brought to that place an Indian from the country\r\nMackinaw who has double the usual number of joints in the human\r\nframe. He is unable to stand, but can give himself locomotion by\r\nbeing placed in a large wooden bowl, which he is enabled to whirl\r\nor roll about on level grounds. Mr. R. also gives an account of an\r\nIndian in that country that is entirely covered with hair, his face\r\nas well as every other part of his body, and that on his arms and\r\nlegs the hair is several inches in length.\r\n\r\n_Population of Baltimore._--In 1790 the number of inhabitants in\r\nthis city and its precincts, was 13,503.--In 1800, 26,514--In 1810,\r\n46,555, and by the present census 62,627.\r\n\r\n_A New Sect of Christians_ are said to have lately appeared at\r\nMarietta, (Ohio) who call themselves Halcyons. They believe that\r\nAaron's breastplate, called by the Jews Urim and Thummim, which has\r\nlong been lost, must be retrieved before the resurrection of the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n_Ivory Paper._--The Society for the encouragement of Arts,\r\nManufactures and Commerce, in London, have voted thirty guineas\r\nto Mr. S. Einsle, for his communication on the use of artists. He\r\nproduced, before the Committee of his Society several specimens of\r\nhis ivory paper, about the eighth of an inch, and of superficial\r\ndimensions, much larger than the largest ivory: the surface was\r\nhard, smooth, and perfectly even. On trial of these, by some of the\r\nartists, members of the society, it appears that colours may be\r\nwashed off the ivory paper more completely than from ivory itself,\r\nand that the process may be repeated three or four times on the\r\nsame surface, without rubbing up the grain of the paper. It will\r\nalso, with proper care, bear to be scraped with the edge of a knife,\r\nwithout becoming rough.\r\n\r\n_Vegetable Antidotes to Poison._--Dr. Chisholm in a paper read to\r\nthe Society at Geneva, states, that the juice of the sugar cane is\r\nthe best antidote known for arsenic. It has been tried upon various\r\nanimals in the West Indies with complete success.\r\n\r\nThe American Academy of Languages and Belles Lettres, at New York,\r\nhas offered a premium of not _less_ than 400 dollars and a Gold\r\nMedal, to the author, being an American Citizen, who, within two\r\nyears, shall produce the best written history of the United States,\r\ncalculated for a Class Book.\r\n\r\n_Increase of Population in America._--In 1810, the population of the\r\nUnited States was 7,323,903. By the recent official report of the\r\nsecretary of the treasury, it appears that our population progresses\r\nin the ratio of 34 per cent, in ten years. Proceeding on this\r\nbasis, for the next 80 years, which will terminate this century, we\r\nshall find the following result.\r\n\r\n  In 1820  9,827,265 Inhabitants.\r\n       30  13,168,534\r\n       40  17,545,844\r\n       50  23,644,433\r\n       60  31,584,633\r\n       70  42,325,903\r\n       80  56,716,716\r\n       90  76,000,399\r\n     1900 101,840,534.\r\n\r\nSuch a review as this ought to produce a salutary influence on all\r\nthe busy actors who now figure on the American theatre.\r\n\r\nThe probability is, that not one mortal now in being, of mature age,\r\nwill be seen on the face of the earth in eighty years; although\r\nmany of our youth will reach that proud era of American glory. What\r\na solemn responsibility devolves on all the conspicuous actors of\r\nthe present day, since this generation is destined to influence the\r\nhappiness of one hundred millions of free born Americans in the\r\nshort span of 80 years! This reflection offers to the contemplative\r\nmind, an extensive range.\r\n\r\n_Drought._--A letter, from a gentleman in Virginia, says that the\r\ndrought has been greater there the last summer, than has been known\r\nfor many years: on inquiry respecting its extent, he was informed by\r\na facetious old farmer, that \"he had to drive his stock thirty miles\r\nto water, but the worst of all was, he had to _cross a river_, in\r\nhis way, and pay the _ferryage_.\"\r\n\r\n  _Square Miles of the States._--In\r\n  Vermont, the number of\r\n  square miles is          10,237\r\n  New Hampshire,            9,491\r\n  Maine, about             40,000\r\n  Massachusetts, is         6,250\r\n  Rhode Island, about       1,580\r\n  Connecticut,              4,674\r\n  New York,                45,000\r\n  New Jersey,               8,320\r\n  Pennsylvania,            46,800\r\n  Delaware,                 2,120\r\n  Maryland,                14,000\r\n  Virginia,                70,000\r\n  North Carolina,          48,000\r\n  South Carolina,          24,080\r\n  Georgia,                 62,000\r\n  Kentucky,                50,000\r\n  Tennessee, length 400 miles,\r\n  breadth                     400\r\n  Ohio,                    39,128\r\n\r\nThe States of Louisiana, Indiana, Illinois, and Alabama, the number\r\nof square miles of each, not ascertained. There are 22 States in\r\nthe Union, each of which have a Legislature, who make all the laws\r\nnecessary for the government of each State distinct from that of the\r\nUnited States.--\r\n\r\n  [_Boston Gazette._\r\n\r\n_Advice and Caution._--When old persons enveigh against the\r\nvanity and nonsense of the world in order to check the wishes\r\nand curiosities of young persons from making their experiments\r\nalso, they remind me of the indifference with which a man hands a\r\nnewspaper to his neighbour, after an hour's enjoyment of it, saying,\r\n\"There's nothing in it, sir.\" The poet speaks more philosophically\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\n      --For youth no less becomes\r\n    The light and careless livery that it wears,\r\n    Than settled age his tables and his weeds\r\n    Importing health and graveness.\r\n\r\n  [_Hamlet._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drawing the wrong tooth._--One of the most curious applications of\r\ngalvanism to the useful purposes of life, is its recent employment\r\nas a means of distinguishing bad teeth from good. The test which\r\ngalvanism has now supplied to remedy the frequent mistakes made by\r\ndentists, who, instead of ridding you of a bad tooth, will draw\r\nthe best tooth you have in your head, is considered to be one\r\nof infallible certainty in its application. The method is thus\r\ndescribed by Professor Aldini, the nephew of Galvani. \"He (the\r\ndentist) first insulates the patient, and then places in his hands\r\nan electric chain; he then applies a small piece of wire, and draws\r\nit gradually over the surface of the tooth; he then applies it\r\nto the next tooth in the same manner, and proceeds in the like\r\nmethod with the rest until he comes to the diseased tooth, which\r\nis discovered by violent pain being produced, and an involuntary\r\nemotion in the body. It has always been remarked when the tooth is\r\nextracted, that it exhibits a careous part, which in its proper\r\nsituation was not visible.\" Need we add, that after the discovery of\r\nso simple a test, drawing a wrong tooth ought to be made felony at\r\nleast?\r\n\r\n_Chemistry applied to industrious Economy._--A new method of killing\r\nanimals, without causing them pain, has been adopted in London: they\r\nare made to expire by means of nitrogen gas. By this means the meat\r\nis rendered much more fresh, of a more agreeable taste, and may\r\nbe preserved for a greater length of time. A great number of the\r\nbutchers of London already employ this process.\r\n\r\n_Olives, Curious Fact in Botany._--Letters from Provence, mention\r\nthe total failure of the olive plantations in that part of France.\r\nIt has, indeed, been remarked, that for upwards of half a century,\r\nthe olives have shown a tendency to emigrate. The soil of Province\r\nnow appears to be entirely ruined, and no hope is entertained there\r\nof the future cultivation of olives. For the last fifty years, none\r\nof the young shoots have risen to above five or six feet high. It is\r\nthe same in the adjacent countries, which have all suffered more or\r\nless from the cold of late years.--Two fifths of these plants have\r\nbeen cut down to the very roots; and three years will scarce suffice\r\nto enable them to attain maturity. The olives of Marseilles and Var\r\nwere some time ago in excellent condition; but all have perished.\r\n\r\n_Rein-deer._--Two rein-deers were brought last November, from\r\nLapland, and are living at liberty at a country seat near Ghent.\r\nThey bear the difference of climate and the variation of temperature\r\nwell, and have produced a well-formed female fawn. This is the\r\nfirst example of these animals having become tame and producing\r\ntheir species so far from their own country.\r\n\r\n_Domestic sewing silk_, of various colours, gathered, from worms\r\nraised in Connecticut, and spun there, and said to be of the very\r\nbest quality, has recently been publicly exposed for sale in Albany.\r\n\r\n_William Griffith, Esq._ of Burlington, N. J., a gentleman\r\nhighly recommended by the veterans of the bar in this city, has\r\nissued proposals for printing a new work to be called the 'LAW\r\nREGISTER'--to make one volume of at least 500 _closely_ printed\r\npages, royal 8vo. for five dollars, per annum, payable on delivery.\r\nSubscriptions to be addressed, (post paid,) to Mr. David Allison,\r\nBurlington, N. J.\r\n\r\n_On the increase of sounds during the night._--It has been remarked,\r\neven by the ancients, that the intensity of sound is greatly\r\nincreasing during the night.--Humboldt was particularly struck with\r\nthis fact when he heard the noise of the great cataracts of the\r\nOrinoco in the plain which surrounds the Mission of the Apures.\r\nThis noise is three times greater in the night than in the day.\r\nSome writers have ascribed this to the cessation of the humming of\r\ninsects, the singing of birds, and the action of the wind upon the\r\nleaves of trees: but this cannot be the cause of it at the Orinoco,\r\nwhere the humming of insects is much greater in the night than in\r\nthe day, and where the breeze is never felt till after sunset.\r\nHumboldt, therefore, ascribes it to the presence of the sun, which\r\nacts on the propagation and intensity of sound, by opposing them\r\nwith currents of air of different density, and partial undulations\r\nof the atmosphere, caused by the unequal heating of different parts\r\nof the ground. In these cases the waves of sound are divided into\r\ntwo waves, where the density of the medium suddenly changes, and\r\na sort of _acoustic mirage_ is produced, arising from the want of\r\nhomogenity of the air in the same manner as the _luminous mirage_ is\r\nproduced from an analogous cause.--_Ann. de Chim._\r\n\r\n_Gil Blas and Don Quixote._--These very ingenious and diverting\r\nauthors seem calculated to please readers of very different\r\ndescriptions. I have observed that literary men are most delighted\r\nwith Don Quixote, and men of the world with Gil Blas. Perhaps\r\nthe preference of Don Quixote in the former may be ascribed to\r\nthe sympathy which learned readers feel for the knight, whose\r\naberrations of intellect originated from too intense an application\r\nto books of his own selection, and from whims which his own brains\r\nengendered.\r\n\r\n_Learned Ladies._--A person who frequently attended the Royal\r\nInstitution, and who was both astonished and delighted with the\r\nnumerous attendence of the fair sex at these scientific lectures,\r\nobserved with a smile somewhat Sardonic, that he saw great advantage\r\narising from that circumstance, as he was sure that for the future\r\nthe sciences would no longer have any secrets.\r\n\r\n_Baron Smyth's Riddle._--Some men of the greatest talents have taken\r\ndelight in composing or endeavouring to unravel riddles. Dean Swift\r\nis a case in point. Sir William Smyth, the learned Irish Baron of\r\nthe Exchequer, at one time spent two days and nights in considering\r\nthe answer to this conundrum: Why is an egg underdone, like an egg\r\noverdone? He would not suffer any one to give him the answer, which\r\nhe at last discovered. It is a tolerable pun enough. Because they\r\nare both _hardly_ done.\r\n\r\n_Disputants._--How often men who love argument in conversation\r\nfollow victory, and not truth. In order to entrap the adversary,\r\na brilliant illustration is substituted for argument, to amuse\r\nthe opponent, and divert him from the line of his reasoning. Bird\r\ncatchers carry a light with them to intice their prey into their\r\nnets, and so the leathered tribe are allured to their captivity.\r\nHigh-flying disputants who are thus led aside by false lights are\r\nnot uncommon.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNORS.\r\n\r\n_In the different states, are chosen as follows:_\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire, annually, in March, by the people.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts, annually, in April, by the people.\r\n\r\nMaine, annually, in January, by the people.\r\n\r\nRhode Island, annually, by the people, though this state retains its\r\noriginal charter of 1663.\r\n\r\nConnecticut, annually, in April, by the people.\r\n\r\nVermont, annually, in September, by the people.\r\n\r\nNew York, once in three years, in April, by the people.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey, annually, by the council and assembly.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania, once in three years, in October, by the people.\r\n\r\nDelaware, once in three years, in October, by the people.\r\n\r\nMaryland, annually, in December, by the general assembly.\r\n\r\nVirginia, annually, by joint ballot of the general assembly.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina, annually, \"by the Senate and House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, once in two years, by the \"Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives.\"\r\n\r\nGeorgia, once in two years, by the general assembly.\r\n\r\nLouisiana, once in four years, by the people.\r\n\r\nKentucky, once in four years, by the people.\r\n\r\nOhio, once in two years, by the people.\r\n\r\nTennessee, once in two years, by the people.\r\n\r\nMississippi, once in two years, by the people.\r\n\r\nIndiana, once in three years, by the people.\r\n\r\nAlabama, once in two years, by the people.\r\n\r\nFrom which we find that ten states elect their governor annually,\r\nsix once in two years, four once in three years, three once in four\r\nyears--23 states; and that the _people_ have a direct _voice_ in the\r\nelection, in all the states, except six.\r\n\r\n  [_Bost. Gaz._\r\n\r\n_Dreaming._--Mr. Andrew Carmichael has published a very ingenious\r\ntheory of dreaming. He enumerates no less than seven different\r\nstates of sleeping and waking--1. When the entire brain and nervous\r\nsystem are buried in sleep; then there is a total exemption from\r\ndreaming. 2. When some of the mental organs are awake, and all the\r\nsenses are asleep: then dreams occur, and seem to be realities.\r\n3. When the above condition exists, and the nerves of voluntary\r\nmotion are also in a state of wakefulness; then may occur the rare\r\nphenomenon of somnambulism. 4. When one of the senses is awake, with\r\nsome of the mental organs; then we may be conscious, during our\r\ndream, of its illusory nature. 5. When some of the mental organs are\r\nasleep, and two or more senses awake; then we can attend to external\r\nimpressions, and notice the gradual departure of our slumbers.\r\n6. When we are totally awake, and in full possession of all our\r\nfaculties and powers. 7. When under these circumstances we are so\r\noccupied with mental operations as not to attend to the impressions\r\nof external objects; and then our reverie deludes us like a dream.\r\n\r\n_Druids._--We learn that the ancient Druids reckoned their days not\r\nby the course of the sun, but by that of the moon. Perhaps some\r\nlearned ladies of this age have adopted the almanack of the Druids,\r\nand regulate their days or rather nights, by this planet; and the\r\ndame of fashion, like the Satan in Paradise Lost, never thinks of\r\nthe sun, but to address him in the lines of that immortal bard.\r\n\r\n  \"To tell him how she hates his beams.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Aborigines of this country is specially\r\nfitted to awaken the sympathy of every feeling heart. They where\r\nonce the exclusive proprietors of this immense continent; but\r\nsuccessive inroads have been so rapidly made on their rights, that\r\nthey have been dwindled, as to power and numbers, into absolute\r\ninsignificance. Our ancestors fled from persecution and tyranny,\r\nand sought in this region an asylum, in which, they might enjoy\r\ncivil and religious liberty. _They were not disappointed._ They\r\nwere received with kindness and hospitality by the natives, a fact,\r\nwhich we their descendants should never forget. And what return\r\nhas too frequently been made for this generous conduct?--Unjust\r\nand inhuman treatment,--the introduction of ruin amongst them--And\r\ngenerally, the pernicious influence of bad example. Notwithstanding\r\nthese painful circumstances some of them occasionally visit the land\r\nof ONAS, to light the calumet of peace and brighten the chain of\r\nfriendship, which uniformly subsisted between him and their fathers.\r\nA journey of this kind was recently made to Philadelphia by a\r\nnumber of Cherokee warriors. The earthly career of one of them, was\r\nterminated in this vicinity, and his exequies were performed by his\r\nbrethren on the 6th of August last, in the woods back of Bartram's\r\ngardens. This incident, has furnished the subject of the following\r\nstanzas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEROKEE'S GRAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Calm be thy slumbers thou heart broken stranger,\r\n    And downy the hillock which pillows thy head,\r\n    The grave is a refuge from sorrow and danger,\r\n    Were wrong and oppression pursue not the dead:\r\n    Though far from thy cabin, thy kindred, and nation.\r\n    Unwept and unhonour'd thy relics repose,\r\n    Ere sleep with her poppies shall steal o'er creation.\r\n    Oft a requiem will hallow the even's still close:\r\n    And he who may wander at that witching hour,\r\n    On the banks of the Schuylkill the greenwood among,\r\n    Shall listen with rapture as night's shadows lower.\r\n    To a soul thrilling anthem by mortals unsung.\r\n    And there shall a cenotaph rise to the glory,\r\n    Which gilds with mild halo the temples of PENN.\r\n    Whose laurels still bloom in their records of story,\r\n    As the friend of the Indian,--the noblest of men.\r\n    But ere the wrapt minstrels evanish for ever,\r\n    May the _Great Spirit_ grant them the heart cheering boon,\r\n    That the lucid example he furnished,--may never,\r\n    Be 'merg'd in the darkness which rests on the tomb:\r\n    That so long as the rivers replenish the ocean,\r\n    And still while with verdure the spring crowns the trees,\r\n    The heart of the white man may feel sad emotion,\r\n    When the woes of the Indian shall sigh in the breeze.\r\n    Calm be thy slumbers thou heart broken stranger.\r\n    And downy the hillock which pillows thy head,\r\n    The grave is a refuge from sorrow and danger,\r\n    Where wrong and oppression pursue not the\r\n    dead.\r\n\r\n  E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Come flattering Hope! now woes distress me,\r\n      Thy flattery I desire again;\r\n    Again rely on thee to bless me,\r\n      To find thy vainness doubly vain,\r\n\r\n    Though disappointments vex and fetter,\r\n      And jeering whisper, thou art vain,\r\n    Still must I rest on thee for better,\r\n      Still hope--and be deceived again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANGLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    When smiling in the pride of May,\r\n    The meads are green, the blossoms gay,\r\n    When fleecy clouds the sky adorn,\r\n    Across the dew-bespangled lawn,\r\n    The angler hies with nimble pace,\r\n    Eager to snare the finny race.\r\n    The glowing landscape charms his eyes,\r\n    Within his ardent bosom rise\r\n    Fond hopes, that numerous watery spoils,\r\n    Ere night, will crown his pleasing toils.\r\n    But ah! ere he his art can try,\r\n    And throw the well-dissembled fly,\r\n    Wherein the swift meandering brook\r\n    The trout may seize his fraudful hook;\r\n    Soon in his mind with fear dismay'd,\r\n    The landscape darkens into shade,\r\n    Black gathering clouds obscure the skies,\r\n    The winds in hollow murmurs rise,\r\n    The rains in copious streams descend,\r\n    And all his fairy visions end.\r\n    The Angler now, with rapid feet,\r\n    Hastens to find a dry retreat,\r\n    And homeward takes his dripping way,\r\n    Sad disappointment's pensive sway,\r\n    Still he resolves, the following morn,\r\n    Again to trace the verdant lawn,\r\n    Again to try his angle's wiles,\r\n    And trust the weather's tempting smiles.\r\n    HOPE, like the limpid stream he loves,\r\n    With various course, still onward moves;\r\n    Though rising high, or sinking low,\r\n    Yet never ceases it to flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOTHER'S LAMENT.\r\n\r\n_By Bernard Barton._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pale and cold is the cheek that my kisses oft press'd,\r\n      And quench'd is the beam of that bright-sparkling eye;\r\n    For the soul, which its innocent glances confess'd,\r\n      Has flown to its God and its Father on high.\r\n\r\n    No more shall the accents, whose tones were more dear\r\n      Than the sweetest of sounds even music can make,\r\n    In notes full of tenderness fall on my ear;\r\n      If I catch them in dreams, all is still when I wake,\r\n\r\n    No more the gay smiles that those features display'd\r\n      Shall transiently light up their own mirth in mine;\r\n    Yet, though these, and much more, be now cover'd in shade,\r\n      I must not, I cannot, and dare not repine.\r\n\r\n    However enchantingly flattering and fair.\r\n      Were the hopes, that for thee, I had ventur'd to build,\r\n    Can a frail, finite mortal presume to declare\r\n      That the future those hopes would have ever fulfilled?\r\n\r\n    In the world thou hast left, there is much to allure\r\n      The most innocent spirit from virtue and peace:\r\n    Hadst thou liv'd, would thy own have been equally pure,\r\n      And guileless, and happy, in age's increase?\r\n\r\n    Temptation, or sooner or later, had found thee;\r\n      Perhaps had seduc'd thee from pathways of light;\r\n    Till the dark clouds of vice, gath'ring gloomily round thee,\r\n      Had enrapt thee for ever in horror and night.\r\n\r\n    But _now_, in the loveliest bloom of the soul,\r\n      While thy heart yet was pangless, and true, and unstain'd;\r\n    Ere the world one vain wish by its witcheries stole,\r\n      What it could not confer, thou for ever hast gain'd\r\n\r\n    Like a dew-drop, kiss'd off by the sun's morning beam,\r\n      A brief, but a beauteous existence was given;\r\n    Thy soul seem'd to come down to earth, in a dream,\r\n      And only to wake, when ascended to heaven!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCH FELLOWSHIP.\r\n\r\n_By James Montgomery._\r\n\r\n\r\n    People of the living God!\r\n      I have sought the world around,\r\n    Paths of sin and Sorrow trod,\r\n      Peace and comfort no where found;\r\n    Now to you my spirit turns,\r\n      Turns,--a fugitive unblest;\r\n    Brethren! where your altar burns,\r\n      O receive me to your rest.\r\n\r\n    Lonely I no longer roam\r\n      Like the cloud, the wind, the wave,\r\n    Where you dwell shall be my home,\r\n      Where you die shall be my grave,\r\n    Mine the God whom you adore,\r\n      Your Redeemer shall be mine;\r\n    Earth can fill my soul no more,\r\n      Every idol I resign.\r\n\r\n    Tell me not of gain and loss,\r\n      Ease, enjoyment, pomp, and power,\r\n    Welcome poverty, and cross,\r\n      Shame, reproach, affliction's hour!\r\n    --\"Follow me!\"--I know thy voice,\r\n      Jesus, Lord! thy steps I see;\r\n    Now I take thy yoke by choice,\r\n      Light thy burthen now to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF THE THERMOMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\n            9 o'cl.   12 o'cl.   3 o'cl.\r\n  Nov.  8,       47         48        51\r\n        9,       49         55        52\r\n       10,       37         41        40\r\n       11,       33         34        34\r\n       12,       Snow this day.\r\n       13,       30         36        34\r\n       14,       30         38        35\r\n       15,       32         39        39\r\n       16,       33         44        44\r\n       17,       37         49        50\r\n       18,       40         50        52\r\n       20,       44         49        46\r\n       21,       46         50        50\r\n       22,       39         52        50\r\n       23,       40         49        33\r\n       24,       45         57        57\r\n       25,       46         48        51\r\n       27,       33         40        36\r\n       28,       31         34        34\r\n       29,       32         41        39\r\n       30,       29         30        29\r\n  Dec.  1,       23         34        33\r\n        2,       33         43        41\r\n        4,       36         39        41\r\n        5,       38         41        41\r\n        6,       39         43        43\r\n        7,       35         42        45\r\n        8,       41         45        44\r\n        9,       38         40        41\r\n       11,       29         34        33\r\n       12,       25         27        26\r\n       13,       27         30        32\r\n       14,       33         38        38\r\n       15,       36         38        42\r\n       16,       28         30        28\r\n       18,       31         32        33\r\n       19,       35         37        33\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAIN GAUGE AT PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   In. hun.\r\n  Novem. 8,      Rain,                0.17\r\n  11 to 12,      Rain and some Snow   2.35\r\n        21,      Rain,                0.30\r\n    Dec. 4,      do.                  0.98\r\n         9,      do.                  0.34\r\n        15,      do.                  0.18\r\n        21,      do.                  0.11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present number of the RURAL MAGAZINE will complete a volume;\r\nand is intended also to terminate our editorial labours in the\r\npresent form. It may perhaps be proper, briefly to advert to the\r\ncircumstances which have led to this determination.\r\n\r\nWe embarked in the enterprise, without making promises not designed\r\nto be performed, or indulging extravagant expectations, as to\r\npatronage and emolument. We honestly believed that important\r\nservices might be rendered to the agricultural interests, which we\r\nconsider the great and growing interests of our country, by the\r\nextensive circulation of such a publication. We had no doubt, that\r\nenlightened and public spirited farmers, would have gladly availed\r\nthemselves of our pages, for the purpose of disseminating useful\r\ninformation, connected with the prosperity and advancement of the\r\nFIRST OF ARTS. In this reasonable expectation, we are compelled to\r\nacknowledge, that we have been entirely disappointed.\r\n\r\nOur farmers of Pennsylvania, who as practical men, if they do not\r\nsurpass, are at least inferior to none in the United States, have\r\ndiscovered a most extraordinary reluctance in committing to writing\r\nthe result of their experience. Hence a principal difficulty in\r\nsupporting with a suitable degree of animation, an agricultural\r\npaper in this place.\r\n\r\nWe nevertheless look forward to the period, and we hope it is not\r\nfar distant, when many of the discouragements which now present\r\nthemselves will have disappeared; when such a work, or one perhaps\r\n_exclusively_ devoted to AGRICULTURE and RURAL AFFAIRS, will be\r\ncalled for, by those most immediately interested. When this time\r\nshall arrive, we may possibly again undertake a work of this\r\nkind; but at present, lest we should be considered obtrusive, our\r\neditorial duties are relinquished.\r\n\r\nTo this we are reluctantly impelled, as well by pecuniary\r\nconsiderations, (for our subscription list has not latterly\r\nincreased as was expected,) as for the reason already stated.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the course which has been pursued, we are unconscious\r\nof having omitted any exertion, or failed in the performance of any\r\nstipulation, which the terms of our engagements seemed to us to\r\nimpose. The twelve numbers published, will form a handsome volume;\r\nand we are induced to believe, contain many articles well worthy of\r\npreservation. For such of our friends, who may wish to have these\r\nbound, and will place them in our hands for that purpose, we will\r\nemploy a binder, and see that the work is executed neatly, and on\r\nthe most moderate terms.\r\n\r\nTo those of our patrons who have been punctual in their remittances,\r\nwe return our thanks. Those who appear to have been unmindful of\r\nthis duty, will we trust remember, as stimulating circumstances, the\r\nsmallness and justice of our claims.--With these observations, we\r\nrespectfully take leave of our readers, and feel desirous of parting\r\nwith them, with sentiments of mutual good will.\r\n\r\nAs we cannot reciprocate the favour to those editors who have sent\r\nus their papers in exchange for ours, we of course will not expect\r\nto receive them in future.\r\n\r\n  RICHARDS & CALEB JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n  _Philadelphia_, 12 _mo._ 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA,\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED MONTHLY BY\r\n\r\nRICHARDS & CALEB JOHNSON,\r\n\r\n_No. 31, Market Street_,\r\n\r\nAt $3.00 per annum.\r\n\r\nGRIGGS & DICKINSON, _Printers_--_Whitehall_.",
