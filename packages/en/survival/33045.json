As I had visited all the principal markets in\r\nNew York City, a market where it is known the world over that if there\r\nis anything in the eatable line to be found it can be found there. This\r\nwas not so of frog meat. After making several attempts and failing,\r\nfinally one day I found about twenty pounds, which had been shipped\r\nfrom a distant point, and when I inquired the price? \"_One dollar a\r\npound_,\" it set me to thinking, as it will you, now that I have brought\r\nthe subject to your notice. At prices like this and the demand far in\r\nexcess of the supply, as I had inquired of the market man if he had\r\nmany calls for frog meat, and his reply was, \"More than we can get to\r\nsupply.\" Now what more inducement does anyone want? This information\r\nshould make you ambitious to go into the business of Frog Raising. You\r\nhear on all sides of you to-day that there is no opportunity to go in\r\nbusiness and make money, as all the branches of industry are\r\noverproduced. Here surely is one line of business that is not\r\noverproduced. And a business that is not necessary to large capital to\r\nstart, and one that bids fair to bring him who ventures good profitable\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROG RAISING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation for Beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are constantly in receipt of inquiries from parties who want\r\ninformation regarding the raising of Frogs. So we have compiled the\r\nfollowing pages to answer more fully such inquiries than we can by\r\nletter. If you do not find the information you want contained herein,\r\nlet us hear from you, and we will take pleasure in advising you to the\r\nbest of our knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe author of this book conceived the idea that there was a large\r\namount of money to be made in Raising Frogs.\r\n\r\nThe object in publishing this book is to get persons who are so\r\nsituated that they can make a business of raising Frogs interested so\r\nas to supply the growing demand that is year by year increasing, and\r\nwith a price ranging from seventy-five cents to one dollar and fifty\r\ncents a pound. This should be an incentive to anyone to start in the\r\nbusiness, when the work of Raising Frogs is so simple, and with such\r\nlarge returns to repay one for their efforts.\r\n\r\nThe principal thing is to study the nature of the Frog in habit and\r\nbreeding. What knowledge we have in the breeding and raising is given\r\nherein, and with the experience gained from observation in Raising\r\nFrogs it soon becomes an interesting and profitable business. Frog\r\nRaising will bring in more profit for the same amount of time and money\r\ninvested than any other industry that we know of. Every farmer, or\r\nfarmer's boy, should have a Frog pond and Raise Frogs.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the lines of business that we have heard about, \"That\r\nmakes money for you while you sleep.\"\r\n\r\nMany farmers already have Frog ponds, and at a greater profit than any\r\nother investment they have on their farm of a like amount. Poultry\r\nkeepers should have a small Frog pond, especially if they market their\r\nproduct in some city near their Plant and have individual customers,\r\nand sell their product direct. They would always have a steady market\r\nfor more Frog meat than they could supply, and at large profitable\r\nprices, as it's a luxury that most people indulge in and would do so\r\nmore often if they knew where to get Frog meat.\r\n\r\nTry yourself to buy Frog meat, and you will soon find that it's not to\r\nbe had at any price in most places, and when it once becomes known that\r\nyou are Raising Frogs you will soon find that your demand for Frog meat\r\nis much greater than you can supply. It works in very well with poultry\r\nraising if you can construct your ponds at not too great an expense,\r\nand is much more profitable considering the investment and work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Desirous of Light Work.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany who are unable to do heavy work will find Frog Raising a very\r\ndesirable occupation. Being in the open air it tends to health, which\r\nis beneficial to those who are sickly and to whom it becomes necessary\r\nto take up one of the lighter occupations. The work is light and with\r\ncare and study can be made a source of a substantial income, and\r\ncarried on intelligently Frog Raising is as certain a business and as\r\nprofitable if not more than many undertakings, and you will always find\r\na ready market for all the Frogs you can raise. Any one of the large\r\nHotels or Restaurants in New York City will use more Frog meat in a\r\nyear than one Frog Raiser can supply, and you can get a standing order\r\nfor shipments of a certain number of pounds each week. Make inquiries\r\nalong this line and you will soon be convinced of the opportunity this\r\nbusiness offers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Country Home.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are living in the city the greater part of the year, and so\r\nfortunate as to have a country home, you by all means should put in a\r\npond and Raise Frogs, as they will be a delicacy for yourself and also\r\nyour friends when they come from the city to see you. And they will be\r\none of the natural products of the country, which one comes from the\r\ncity to the country to enjoy, and to many they will be an interesting\r\nand novel sight. And in winter, when you are away, they will be dormant\r\nand need no care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a Business.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are going into Frog Raising as a business, we recommend that you\r\nmake a small beginning, for nothing is more discouraging, after having\r\ngone into a business exclusively, than to have reverses in the start\r\nand lose a large portion of your investment for want of a little\r\npractical experience. Many persons have met failure by starting on a\r\nlarge scale at first, and without practical experience, where had they\r\nstarted small might to-day be a grand success. This caution applies in\r\nall business ventures, and it's the mistake that is made and cause of\r\nmost failures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen to Begin.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe recommend the active work to begin in the early spring. Get your\r\nponds ready as soon as possible. Get your stock and place it early, so\r\nit becomes familiar with its new quarters before the breeding season\r\nsets in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATCHING AND WAITING]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Much to Invest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, of course, depends largely on the circumstances. If you have\r\nabundant means and delight in some hobby and want to make a fancy\r\nproposition out of it, why you can make your ponds as expensive and\r\npicturesque as you wish. But for those who wish to make a business for\r\nthe benefit of the income to be derived, should start with a small pond\r\nand about six pairs of Frogs. Then gradually increase your breeding\r\npond as your stock and ability to handle it demands. Don't start with\r\nFrogs under four years of age. They will be the cheapest in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ponds and How to Construct Them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have a running stream of water on your place, the work of\r\nbuilding the ponds is much easier than where you have to depend on\r\nfilling them from pumped water.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to have several ponds, one large pond is not\r\nsatisfactory. The reason for this is explained later. A plant for\r\nbusiness should have at least four ponds. The depth of the ponds need\r\nnot be very great, three feet is ample, and they could be less if you\r\ncan have a good loam bottom that will hold water. But three feet is\r\nvery satisfactory, and this graduating off to two feet, and one foot\r\ndeep at the bank is plenty. A good shape and cheap way to build the\r\nponds is like the cut shown. If the ground you have won't allow of this\r\narrangement why make to best arrangement your ground will permit for\r\nconvenience, carrying out the plan advisable for Raising Frogs. You\r\nmust have a breeding pond, a hatching pond, a raising and a stock pond,\r\nfour ponds in all. The stock pond should be the largest, permitting of\r\nplenty of room for growing and opportunity to get food. The size of\r\nyour ponds depends largely on the amount of land available, its\r\ntopography and the water supply. Ponds not less than one-half acre in\r\narea, with the inlet at one end and the outlet at the other, in a line\r\nof its longest axis, generally produce the best results, though smaller\r\nponds can be successfully used.\r\n\r\nAt least one-fourth of each of the ponds should not be over one foot in\r\ndepth, and this portion should be planted with pond weed\r\n(_Potamogeton_) and water weed (_Elodea_, or _Anacharis_) to facilitate\r\nthe production and growth of the minute animals which furnish so large\r\na part of the food for the Frogs at all stages of growth. The rest of\r\nthe pond should have a gradually sloping bottom, and consequent\r\nincrease depth to the outlet (or drawoff), where the water should be at\r\nleast five feet deep, so that in drawing off the ponds the stock can be\r\nassembled in a small area for sorting, etc. The bottom of the ponds,\r\npreferable, soft muck, in which the Frogs can bury themselves in cold\r\nweather and avoid against danger of freezing. In the middle of all the\r\nponds, except the spawn hatching pond, water lilies should be planted,\r\nthe large pods, such as (_Nymphea alba_). These plants furnish hiding\r\nplaces from fish hawks, also serve as a sun shade and stool for sunning\r\nduring summer. It is not advisable to place large bowlders in the pond,\r\nas they are in the way of seining or netting, and furnish an acceptable\r\nresort for crawfish, which are enemies when large. Nursery ponds should\r\nbe constructed to afford young protection from enemies and to produce\r\nthe greatest quantity of insect life suited for their sustenance, and\r\nthis is better accomplished with a number of small ponds than with one\r\nlarge one. A good working size for spawn breeding is from 40 to 50 feet\r\nlong, by 12 to 15 feet wide, with a depth of from 18 to 36 inches deep\r\nto the outlet. Where the topography of the ground will permit it is\r\nbetter to have the nurseries immediately adjoining the spawning pond.\r\nWith water supply from same source, so that there will be but slight\r\ndifference between the temperature of the shallowest part of nursery\r\npond and surface of water of spawning pond. If the location is infested\r\nwith crawfish or snakes the nurseries should be protected by wire\r\nscreens. The spawning nursery ponds may be combined by constructing one\r\ncomparatively long pond, narrow near the middle, so that the general\r\nshape would be like an hour-glass. Across the narrow part is to be\r\nstretched a screen of one-quarter inch wire cloth, which will confine\r\nthe spawners to the deeper end of the pond, while the fry or hatching\r\nspawn will be kept separate. This form of pond is advantageous where\r\nfor any reason only a few ponds can be built. Between all ponds that\r\nare connected they should be screened where water runs from one pond to\r\nthe other, that is, at the inlet and outlets.\r\n\r\nEach pond should be surrounded by one-half inch wire mesh two feet\r\nhigh. This makes a protection to the ponds from enemies, and also keeps\r\nthe Frogs confined to the ponds they are intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCare of Ponds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accumulated decayed matter ought to be occasionally removed. The\r\nfrequency of this depends on character of the water supply, the amount\r\nof silt it brings into the ponds, the character of the soil, and on the\r\nthoroughness of the yearly removal of the surplus vegetation. Care\r\nshould be taken that the ponds do not become offensive with stagnant\r\nwater and rotten vegetation. This condition is detrimental to large\r\nproduction; while abundant pond vegetation is favorable to a large\r\nproduction of fry it must not become decayed. It is sometimes so\r\nluxuriant that it settles down in a blanket-like mass and smothers and\r\npens in many of the young Frogs. Under such conditions it should be\r\nremoved frequently. This can be done by lowering the ponds, if they are\r\nbuilt so they can be drawn off, which is a very desirable and\r\nconvenient way if the topography of the land will permit. A strong\r\nflat-bottom boat should be made, in which can be taken the surplus\r\nmatted vegetation and carried off. At each end of the boat a ring\r\nshould be fastened, through which stakes can be driven to hold the boat\r\nat points in the pond to be worked. The vegetation is raked from the\r\nwater in small lots. Care should be taken not to bring up any of the\r\nsmall Frogs and Tadpoles with the vegetation. It should be removed from\r\nthe banks of the ponds at once, as it will rot very fast, and its\r\npresence is objectionable.\r\n\r\nIf a boat is not used the vegetation can be drawn near the shore with\r\nlong-handled rakes and taken out with long-handled pitchforks made\r\nespecially.\r\n\r\nThis method is simple and much more economical. Two men can accomplish\r\nmore than five men by the other method. The advantage in favor of the\r\nboat is that you do not need to disturb the whole mass, but pick it out\r\nhere and there as you think best, and have it more uniform and not\r\ndestroy the roots so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Profit in Swamp Lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwamp lands, on a farm, converted into Froggeries, _bring in large\r\nprofits_. If you have a piece of ground which is swampy, which can be\r\nfound on most any farm, and you do not convert this into \"_Raising\r\nFrogs_,\" you are losing one of the most profitable products of your\r\nfarm, as _more money_ can be made from an _acre of swamp land in a\r\nFroggery than ten acres in wheat_, if properly managed, and with little\r\nexpense. You first want to excavate a portion of it where you can have\r\nwater, 50 x 15 feet, and another part of it 15 x 20 feet, and fence it\r\nin, as explained above with a 2-foot one-half mesh wire. In the larger\r\npond place the breeding Frogs, and in the smaller one hatch out the\r\nspawn, and when they are developed into Frogs turn them loose on the\r\nswamp to grow until they maintain marketable size. If there is a small\r\nstream or ditch running through the swamp, which very often is the\r\ncase, then it is an easy task. And here is where the old saying can be\r\napplied, \"Makes money for you while you sleep.\" And good, big money it\r\nmakes, too. _Don't put off_ turning your swamp into a _money-maker_. DO\r\nIT NOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Edible Frog (Rana Esculenta.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FEMALE FROG.]\r\n\r\nTwo species of Rana are common in America and Europe, viz., _Rana\r\nesculenta_ and _Rana temporaria_. The latter alone is indigenous to\r\nGreat Britain, and varieties of it extend throughout temperate Europe\r\nand Asia to Japan, and one variety (_pretiosa_) exists in the United\r\nStates. The edible Frog (_Rana esculenta_), however, has been\r\nintroduced into England. An Indian species (_Rana breviceps_) and\r\nseveral South African species burrow in the ground.\r\n\r\nECOLOGY AND HABITS. The skin of Frogs is usually smooth and free from\r\nwarts or horny excrescences. It is invested with a colorless epidermis,\r\nwhich is shed from time to time as the creature grows; this splits\r\nalong the back and thighs, is worked over the head like the taking off\r\nof a shirt, and usually eaten by the wearer. The deeper layers contain\r\nmuch pigment, in cells which are more or less under muscular control,\r\nenabling Frogs to change their hue to conform to the background.\r\n\r\nFrogs are carnivorous, and in the season of activity are likely to be\r\nvery voracious. The terrestrial and arboreal forms feed mainly on\r\ninsects, worms, etc. The aquatic kinds also catch insects, but subsist\r\nmore on aquatic animals--worms, tadpoles, small fishes, and other\r\nFrogs. These are seized and slowly swallowed, often, where before the\r\nremainder, perhaps still alive, has been got within the mouth.\r\n\r\nExtremes of cold or drought in climate must be avoided by Frogs.\r\nMoisture of the skin is necessary to their health, and in very dry\r\nplaces or seasons they survive only by going deeply under ground. Thus\r\nsome tropical species get through the \"dry season.\" The frogs of\r\nnorthern climates endure the winter by clustering about spring-holes\r\nand other places where the water is comparatively warm and free of ice;\r\nor else by hibernating in the mud. Terrestrial species bury themselves\r\nfor the winter in the loam, or burrow into the dry dust of rotting logs\r\nand stumps. Their vitality is strong, and their power of regeneration\r\nfrom partial congelation is very great.\r\n\r\nThough most species live always in or near water, many spend the\r\ngreater part of their time away from it, and often in bushes or trees.\r\nThese, however, go to the water to breed; and as this function is\r\nlikely to demand attention early in the spring, it is then that these\r\nanimals make themselves most conspicuous by the incessantly uttered\r\ncroaking or rattling calls of the males, which are almost as varied as\r\nthe songs of the birds, and more ventriloquistic. These are wholly the\r\ncries of the male Frogs, and cease when the mates have been found and\r\nhave spawned; and to assist in producing them many species have gular\r\nair-sacs, which are connected with the vocal organs and furnish the\r\npower required for the loud and insistent utterances. The great\r\near-drums correlated with this vocal power are conspicuous in many\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe reproductive habits of Frogs are various. All of our common species\r\nlay their eggs in water, the eggs being fertilized as they are laid. As\r\nthe eggs are laid they are inclosed in a gelatinous envelope secreted\r\nby the female. This swells and protects the eggs from injury, from\r\nbeing fed upon, from the direct rays of the sun, and in some species it\r\nserves to float the eggs at the surface of the water, where oxygen is\r\nmost abundant; finally, the envelope serves as food for the young\r\nfrogs. The mouth of the tadpole is small and provided with a horny\r\nbeak, which takes the place of the teeth which are not yet developed.\r\nThe tadpole feeds on algae that cover stones, and on the flesh of dead\r\nanimals. The long, spirally coiled intestine, which can be seen on the\r\nunder side of the animal, is an adaptation to its prevailingly\r\nherbivorous diet, which requires a prolonged digestion.\r\n\r\nThe tadpole usually lives in the water for two or three months before\r\nit takes to land. In the Bullfrog, however, the transformation (see\r\nTOAD) does not take place until the second summer.\r\n\r\nIn many tropical Frogs the reproductive habits are much modified. One\r\nspecies (_Phyllobates trinitatis_) of Venezuela and Trinidad carries\r\nits tadpoles on its back, to which the young attach themselves by means\r\nof their suckers. A frog of the Seychelles Islands lives in the\r\ntree-ferns far from water, and carries its young about on its back, to\r\nwhich they are attached by their bellies. In the Kameruns lives a Frog\r\nthat lays its eggs in a foamy mass on the leaves of a tree. When the\r\nlarvae are developed the mass becomes slimy and the tadpoles swim about\r\nit, and when a heavy rain falls they are washed into pools of water\r\nlying at the bases of the trees. The foam is probably produced as it is\r\nin culinary operations, by air being entangled in it by a beating that\r\nthe Frog gives the jelly with its feet. The inclosed air may well serve\r\nin respiration. Compare TOAD.\r\n\r\nUTILITIES. Among both civilized and savage men Frogs are a culinary\r\ndainty. The edible European Frog is so much prized in France that it is\r\nbred for the market in large preserves. In the United States both the\r\nBullfrog and spring Frog are sold in the markets. In France and the\r\nUnited States the hind legs alone are eaten; they are known as\r\n\"saddles\" to American marketmen, and are usually served at table fried.\r\nIn Germany all the muscular parts are served stewed, often with sauce.\r\nFrogs have enabled man to contribute much to his knowledge of\r\nphysiology. The tail of the tadpole, so frequently fed on by dragon-fly\r\nlarvae and other aquatic enemies, has great capacity of regeneration.\r\nThe study of its re-formation has added to our knowledge of the\r\nregeneration of animal tissue. The circulation of the blood, so readily\r\nseen by the aid of the microscope in the web of the Frog's foot, is a\r\nclassic and painless classroom demonstration. Observations on the\r\nresponse of Frog-muscle to stimuli led the great Italian physiologist\r\nGalvani to the discovery of dynamical or current electricity, known to\r\nus as galvanic or voltaic electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MALE FROG. (See Blower.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNests and Nest Building.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever the spawning period occurs, ample warning will be given, as\r\nthe male Frogs will begin croaking for their mate, and will be seen\r\nnear the shore. Early in the spring is the breeding season, and the\r\nFrogs will be seen in pairs, working in company, selecting nests, which\r\nare in place where there is a vegetation to attach the spawn, near the\r\nsurface of the water, as the action of the sun has much to do with the\r\nhatching of the spawn.\r\n\r\nImpregnation takes place immediately after the spawn is deposited, as\r\nwith the spawn of fish. The spawn of frogs looks like a gelatin mass in\r\nthe shape of a bunch of grapes, and will be found attached to some\r\nvegetation in the pond. This should be immediately taken out with a\r\nlarge, long handle dipper and deposited in the hatching pond, as the\r\nspawn will be destroyed by the frogs jumping into the pond and coming\r\nin contact with it, for if the spawn is separated or broken up and\r\nsinks to the bottom of the pond, where it cannot get the proper action\r\nof the sun, many of the eggs will not hatch, but will be destroyed and\r\neaten. The nursery, or hatching pond, should be constructed in this\r\nway: Make some skeleton frames that will set on the bottom of the pond,\r\nand come within a few inches of the top of the water. Fasten the frames\r\ndown, either by weights or stakes driven in the ground. Take some fine\r\nnetting such as used on windows to keep out flies; cotton or flax\r\nnetting preferred to wire. Fasten this netting to the frame. Be sure\r\nthat the netting is always covered with water when spawn is on it. On\r\nthis netting, deposit the eggs or spawn taken from the breeding pond.\r\nIn this way it will be undisturbed, and the sun can do its part toward\r\nthe hatching of the eggs. This method will be found successful, and you\r\ncan watch the progress, and the influence of the sun and water on the\r\nhatching of the eggs and note the change from day to day, as the Frogs\r\nhave nothing more to do with their development. Another reason for\r\nseparating the eggs or spawn from the breeding ponds is, when the spawn\r\nis hatched into tadpoles, the Frogs will eat the tadpoles as fast as\r\nthey wiggle out of the egg. In fact, Frogs are cannibals, and will eat\r\nthe young until they get large enough to protect themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is why ponds should be constructed so that Frogs of different\r\nsizes can be separated, and all of about a size, kept in ponds by\r\nthemselves, and raised together. By this arrangement you save many\r\nsmall Frogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnemies of Spawn, Tadpoles and Small Frogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enemies must be guarded against by proper fencing with wire netting\r\nand boards. A board should be sunken into the ground at least three\r\ninches, and 2 foot 2 inch mesh wire fastened on it. If a 12-inch board\r\nis used, this will make a fence about 34 inches high. It could be built\r\nhigher if desired, but this height makes a good appearance. The enemies\r\nare rats, cats, turtles, water centipedes, water beetles, coons,\r\nleeches and snakes. Snakes are one of the worst enemies, as they will\r\ndevour the spawn, of which they are very fond, and also the small\r\nFrogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHatching and Progress of the Young Frogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1 represents the embryo as it appears several days after the egg\r\nis deposited. Figure 2 gives an outline of its form; the arrows at the\r\nside of the head shows the currents of water, which are seen to flow to\r\nthe branchiae by the breathing of the young animal. A short period\r\nbrings it to the form represented in Nos. 3 and 4, the latter\r\nrepresenting the head. Figure 5 shows the form of the tadpole when\r\nfirst hatched, which usually takes place about four weeks after the\r\ndepositing of the egg. Figures 6, 7 and 8 shows various stages of its\r\ndevelopment; the latter representing the tadpole, called pollywog\r\nsometimes; this, for some time, now undergoes little change of form,\r\nbut increases in size. At length the hinder legs bud, and are gradually\r\ndeveloped, as seen in No. 9; the fore legs are ere long produced in a\r\nsimilar manner.\r\n\r\nHATCHINGS. The tail begins now to diminish, as seen in No. 10, and is\r\nfinally absorbed into the body and disappears. The tadpole (which, for\r\na time, is like a fish and breathing by branchiae, or gills, and feeding\r\non vegetable food of fishes) is now a frog; breathes the air by true\r\nlungs, and betakes itself to the land, where it pursues the avocations\r\nof its new and higher life, whereas it before swam by means of a tail\r\nit now leaps, and as before, it ate only roots and grass, it now\r\nbecomes a hunter of insects and worms. This, or a very similar process\r\nof reproduction, is common to all species of the family. The Rana Frogs\r\nform the highest group of the Batrachian class. They are active\r\ncreatures, feeding on insects and worms. Those which live upon the\r\nground in the neighborhood of standing water, and pass a considerable\r\nportion of their lives in the water, have their toes pointed, and those\r\nof the hinder feet united, almost to the tips, by membrane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFood for Tadpoles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spawn or egg takes from four to six weeks to hatch to the shape of\r\na tadpole, and the tadpole takes about four or five months to hatch or\r\nchange its shape from that of a tadpole to a small frog, which is done\r\nas stated in previous paragraph. Frogs are very prolific. One bunch of\r\nspawn, from large, well developed frogs, and of five years of age or\r\nover, will produce or hatch over one thousand tadpoles. But of course\r\nall of these will not be raised to become small Frogs. But a great\r\nproportion of them can be if properly cared for and you have the proper\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nThe beak of the tadpole is adapted to the eating of leaves and other\r\nvegetable foods, and on which they could entirely subsist. But it is\r\nwell to give them access to small insect food, much of which they can\r\nget from surface of water. The food changes entirely when the tadpole\r\ndevelops into a Frog. When a frog, the food is entirely insect or live\r\nfood. It is well, sometimes, when you cannot get facilities to supply\r\nnaturally plenty of insect food, to take some of the smaller Frogs and\r\ntadpoles and place them in the ponds with the growing Frogs, and allow\r\nthe Frogs to live on them. They must be fed live food. Chopped meats\r\nand food of this character will do for tadpoles, but must not be used\r\ntoo freely, as they do not eat it readily, and it only decays and a\r\nstifling stench follows. If your ponds are connected with a running\r\nstream, much of the insect life for the tadpoles and smaller Frogs is\r\nbrought into the ponds by the stream, which is very desirable, and\r\nsaves much extra work. Leave the tadpoles in the nursery pond until\r\nthey have developed into Frogs. The tadpoles are fish in a sense and\r\nwill eat most anything, either vegetable or animal matter. In fact, he\r\nis a scavenger, and will clean out the ponds. But as soon as he turns\r\ninto a frog, he requires a different class of food, as he is an\r\namphibious animal. Remember this, as herein, is one of the secrets that\r\nhave caused so many failures. THE FOOD FOR FROGS IS ANIMAL FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFood for Frogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACTION OF FROG'S TONGUE IN CATCHING A FLY.]\r\n\r\n_Caution_, from this time on, ANIMAL FOOD ONLY. No chopped meat, as\r\nFrogs will not eat it, and it will decay and cause a stench. Do not\r\nattempt to feed it to frogs. This is the time that care must be taken\r\nto see that your Frogs get plenty of the proper kind of animal food. If\r\nthey are not kept supplied, they will turn to and eat each other, and\r\nin this way destroy many a pound of good Frog meat, that is worth \"One\r\nDollar a pound\" or more. As the tadpoles hatch out prolifically, it's\r\nwise to keep a quantity of these and the Small Frogs on hand to feed\r\nthe larger ones that are being gotten ready for market. By having a\r\nnumber of small ponds, this stock can be kept on hand for this purpose.\r\nA plant that will grow on top of the water furnishes many insects, as\r\nwell as perching places to basque, in the sun, and catch a passing\r\nunsuspecting fly. It also affords a shady place to get under on a hot\r\nday, with head above water looking for food. _One of the best and\r\neasiest ways to furnish live food is to soak a number of potato or feed\r\nbags with molasses, and fasten them up around the ponds_, just above\r\nthe ground. This draws the flies, and they will come within reach of\r\nthe Frogs, and as you will see by the cut at top of this paragraph, the\r\ntongue of the Frog is developed to be of service in catching them.\r\nSmall tadpoles from other species of frogs, that are not eatable, make\r\ngood food for them. These can be found in large quantities along most\r\nany stream, or in any pool of water. Wood lice or sow-bugs are good. In\r\nplanting vegetable matter in the ponds be sure and always plant from\r\nseed, as in transplanting you may bring Leeches into your ponds, which\r\nare very destructive to the Frogs, and act on the Frogs the same as\r\nchicken lice do on chicken, and in time will kill the Frog, and at all\r\ntimes retard its growth. If your Frogs do not thrive well look for\r\nLeeches.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT. If it is necessary to feed your Frogs on small fry from\r\nfishes or on tadpoles and small Frogs, it might be well to have a\r\nsupply pond, which can be small, and in feeding it is only necessary to\r\n_feed twice a week_, and can be done by putting quantities here and\r\nthere in the ponds, and let the Frogs catch them as they swim about.\r\nThree gillies, tadpole or small Frogs is considered a fair meal for\r\neach Frog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCatching the Frogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several ways by which to catch the Frogs when ready to\r\nmarket. If they are to be dressed they can be speared; this is done\r\nwith a handle like is found on an ordinary house broom with a fish\r\nspear fastened in the end. One of the best times to spear them is at\r\nnight with a light as they come on the bank at night to catch bugs.\r\nThey can also be caught very readily with a hand net, same as used in\r\nlanding trout. This net can be purchased at most any hardware store, or\r\nwhere they keep fishing tackle. If the Frogs are to be marketed alive\r\nthey must be caught in this way. In shipping them alive always put wet\r\nweeds from the pond in bottom of box if they are to go any distance,\r\nand put instructions on the box for agent to keep the weeds wet while\r\nin transit. This will insure safe delivery of live frogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Things About Frogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF A FROG.]\r\n\r\nWe here repeat many of the principal items we have previously\r\nmentioned, because they are the questions which are most frequently\r\nasked. Frogs are very prolific. One bunch of eggs will hatch more than\r\na thousand tadpoles, and if you had the facilities, they could be\r\nhatched and reared to marketable size. A good running stream, which can\r\nbe coursed through all your ponds, makes Frog Raising very simple and\r\nprofitable. A living can be made from \"Frog Raising\" if you are\r\nfavorably located, and the main qualities needed is patience and good\r\ncommon sense, to which observation should be added. It takes Frogs, to\r\ngrow to marketable size, from two to three years.\r\n\r\nThe eggs take six weeks to hatch out. The tadpole takes from five to\r\nsix months to turn into a Frog. And the Frog, to grow to marketable\r\nsize, about two years.\r\n\r\nHere lies the secret of the high price of Frog meat. The time it takes\r\nbefore the Frog can be developed to marketable size discourages many\r\nfrom entering into the business. But once equipped and the first three\r\nyears gone over, from that time on the revenue is continuous and the\r\nprofit large, and you have a yearly income equalled by no other line of\r\nbusiness, as you have always got some Frogs that are coming into\r\nmarketable size. And the income, from this product, depends entirely on\r\nhow large a scale you want to enter it. Another source of revenue,\r\nwhich is very profitable, is selling breeding Frogs to beginners, as it\r\nis only the \"Edible Frog\" that is profitable to raise for market, and\r\nit takes from four to five years to get the best breeders. They bring\r\ngood prices. The prices range according to the age. Frogs will breed\r\nfrom two years old, but the best results are obtained from the older\r\nmates, as the older and larger the Frog, the heavier and larger the\r\nspawn, and the more eggs will hatch and produce stronger and sturdier\r\ntadpoles, and from these mates the Frogs grow large more quickly. So in\r\nstarting, it is always better to pay a little more for your breeding\r\nstock and not use so many pairs, and get good old settlers, as the\r\nsaying is, when you hear them croak, \"There is a good old settler.\" And\r\nbe sure to start right, not with the common meadow green Frog, which is\r\neatable, but has a strong taste and does not grow to any size. The\r\naverage size of this Frog at most any age is about three inches, and\r\nyou will be greatly disappointed after you have spent your time and\r\nfind that you have not had the profitable breeder. Get the Frog known\r\nas the \"Edible Frog of England.\" This is the (Rana Esculenta).\r\n\r\nThe subject of Frog Raising is a limited one. We have, however, tried\r\nto give as briefly as possible all the essential details and secrets to\r\nsuccess of Raising Frogs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"PATIENCE REWARDED.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBe sure and get the Edible Frog when you start, as they are the best\r\nfor table and bring the highest prices, and grow to marketable size\r\nmore rapidly, which is a big item. We always have breeding stock for\r\nsale at following prices:\r\n\r\n    3 year old Frogs, per pair     $ 4.00\r\n\r\n    4 year old Frogs, per pair       8.00\r\n\r\n    5 year old Frogs, per pair      10.00\r\n\r\nPlace your orders early, so as to be sure and get your breeders in\r\ntime to get the advantage of early breeding.
