It is\r\nthought that Ballantyne used it as the inspiration for his famous \"The\r\nCoral Island\", for there is good evidence for it.  In the 1830s the\r\nWashington left New York, the passengers including some of the young\r\nmembers of the owners' families and some of their friends.  Destination\r\nCanton via the Straits of Magellan.  Crossing the Pacific, they land on\r\nvarious of the islands, such as those in the Fiji and Kingsmill Groups.\r\nSometimes they encountered particularly nasty inhabitants.  One day they\r\nwere on the beach of an island, when it became necessary for the\r\nWashington to up anchors and away, leaving the shore party with the\r\nship's boat.  Murders occur among the seamen.  The boys set sail in the\r\nboat, hoping to regain contact with some vessel, but never do.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the book is a story of survival, and of the good humour of\r\nthe boys.  The real problem with the book is the long paragraphs of\r\ndescription which nowadays would be much shorter or omitted altogether,\r\nbut it was written in the 1850s, and it was Ballantyne's luck that he\r\nwas able to write a book along the same lines but far easier to read.\r\n\r\nStill, it's worth a quick skim, if nothing more.  Your reviewer has\r\nlistened to the book several times, and enjoyed it each time.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nTHE ISLAND HOME, THE ADVENTURES OF SIX YOUNG CRUSOES, BY RICHARD ARCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n  \"A wet sheet and a flowing sea,\r\n  A breeze that follows fast,\r\n  That fills the white and rustling sail,\r\n  And bends the gallant mast.\r\n  And bends the gallant mast, my boys,\r\n  Our good ship sound and free,\r\n  The hollow oak our palace is,\r\n  Our heritage the sea.\"\r\n\r\nIt is now some twenty years ago, that the goodly ship Washington,\r\ncommanded by Mr Erskine, left the port of New York, on a trading voyage\r\nto the East Indian archipelago.  With a select few good seamen, the\r\nowners had also placed on board some youths of their own families and\r\nimmediate connections.\r\n\r\nHaving passed through the Straits of Magellan in safety, they were then\r\non their way to Canton, where the young men were to be settled; and\r\nmeanwhile the ship was to visit any of the isles in the Pacific Ocean\r\nthat lay in their path.  After some little delay on the part of the\r\ncaptain among the numerous groups of isles, the purpose of the voyage\r\nwas frustrated by the events narrated in the volume.  The extreme beauty\r\nof the wild loveliness of nature that these islets exhibited, tempted\r\nthe young men, accompanied by Mr Frazer, one of the officers, to land\r\non one that presented great charms of scenery, as well as having a\r\nconvenient and easily accessible landing-place, and from that point the\r\nnarrative commences.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for the elucidation of the narrative, to name more\r\nof the crew than those whose adventures are hereafter related by one of\r\nthe party.  The names of these castaways were John Browne, the son of a\r\nGlasgow merchant; William Morton, and Maximilian Adeler, of New York;\r\nRichard Archer, from Connecticut, the journalist; John Livingstone, from\r\nMassachusetts; Arthur Hamilton, whose parents had settled at Tahiti; and\r\nto them was joined Eiulo, prince of Tewa, in the South-Seas.\r\n\r\nThe narrative commences from the time of the party landing, and although\r\nin some parts prolix and unequal, being evidently from an unpractised\r\nhand, it bears all the characteristics of a boyish mind, and thus to a\r\ncertain extent confirms its genuineness.  The sayings and doings of the\r\nyoung adventurers are recorded with the minuteness that to older heads\r\nseems tedious.  This disposition to dwell upon, and to attach importance\r\nto things comparatively trivial, is peculiar to the youthful mind, and\r\nmarks that period of freshness, joyousness, and inexperience, when every\r\nthing is new, and possesses the power to surprise and to interest.\r\n\r\nWhat became of the ship and crew we are not informed; but we may\r\nconclude, that insubordination would lead to neglect and carelessness,\r\nand that the vessel was wrecked and plundered by the native; and the\r\nwretched crew murdered or detained.\r\n\r\nThe South Pacific Ocean abounds with thousands of islands, of a vast\r\nmany of which we have no account; but those mentioned in these pages\r\nappear to be the _Samoas_, the _Kingsmill_, and the _Feejee Groups_ of\r\nislands, which lie nearly under the equator, and they are described by\r\nCaptain Charles Wilkes, in his narrative of the United States Exploring\r\nExpedition between the years 1838 and 1842.  These islands were all\r\nvisited by the different vessels engaged in the expedition; many of them\r\nappear to be of volcanic formation, others are of coral origin; they are\r\nall characterised as possessing an exceedingly fertile soil; they abound\r\nwith a picturesque beauty of scenery, and luxuriant vegetation, which\r\nexcites the most painful feelings when we learn, that where nature has\r\nbestowed so much bounty, the inhabitants are, it is greatly to be\r\nfeared, cannibals.  In some two or three islands, a solitary white man\r\nwas found, one of whom, Paddy Connell, (an Irishman, of course), a\r\nshort, wrinkled old man, with a beard reaching to his middle, in a rich\r\nMilesian brogue, related his adventures during a forty years' residence\r\nat Ovolan, one of the Feejees.  Paddy, with one hundred wives, and\r\nforty-eight children, and a vast quantity of other live stock, expressed\r\nhis content and happiness, and a determination to die on the island.  In\r\nother cases, the white men expressed an earnest desire to quit the\r\nisland, and were received on board the expedition, to the great grief of\r\ntheir wives and connections.\r\n\r\nThe _Samoan Islands_ are of volcanic structure, with coral reefs, and\r\nthe harbours are generally within these reefs; and one of them was\r\ndiscovered by Commodore Byron in 1765, who reported it as destitute of\r\ninhabitants.  Their character is variable, and during the winter months\r\nthey have long and heavy rains, and destructive hurricanes sometimes\r\noccur.  The air is generally moist, and light winds and calms during the\r\nsummer, render vegetation luxuriant.\r\n\r\nThe woods in the interior of these islands are very thick, and are\r\ncomposed of large and fine trees; there are pandanus, palms, tree ferns,\r\nand a remarkable species of banyan, whose pendant branches take root to\r\nthe number of thousands, forming steps of all dimensions, uniting to the\r\nmain trunk, more than eight feet above the ground, and supporting a vast\r\nsystem of horizontal branches, spreading like an umbrella over the tops\r\nof other trees.  The bread-fruit is the most abundant of all the trees,\r\nand grows to a very large size; the cocoa-nut, the wild orange, and the\r\nlime, are all to be found.  Bamboos, wild sugar-cane, wild nutmeg,\r\nbesides many others, only require cultivation.  Caoutchouc, gum arabic,\r\ncastor beans, ginger, orris root, and coffee, will in time be added to\r\nthese productions.  Lemons and sweet oranges have already been planted,\r\nand promise a large product.\r\n\r\nSwine are abundant and cattle rapidly increasing.  Poultry of all kinds\r\nis very plentiful, and fish are taken in abundance.\r\n\r\nThe beneficent effects of missionary labours are very evident amongst\r\nthe Samoans; they are not now subject to wars, and for crimes they have\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nTheir habits are regular; they rise with the sun, and after a meal,\r\nbathe and oil themselves, and then go to their occupations for the day;\r\nthey eat at one o'clock, and again at eight, retiring to rest about\r\nnine.  The men do all the hard work, even to cookery.  The women are\r\nheld in much consideration, and are treated with great kindness and\r\nattention.  They take care of the house and children, prepare the food\r\nfor cooking, and manufacture the mats, etcetera.\r\n\r\nTheir houses are carefully constructed, generally occupying eighteen\r\nmonths in building; the floor is paved with small round stones, and\r\ndivisions or separate apartments formed.  In some villages, broad walks\r\nand paths are kept in nice order.  The females generally wear a kind of\r\nrobe, similar to the poncho of the South Americans; and although not\r\nwhat may be termed pretty, they have some degree of bashfulness, which\r\nrenders them interesting in appearance; when young, they are but little\r\ndarker than a brunette, or South American Spaniard.\r\n\r\nThe entire population of the group is estimated at 60,000, of whom more\r\nthan one-fourth have embraced Christianity, and it is understood that\r\nmore than two-thirds of the population are favouring the progress of the\r\ngospel.  Many thousands attend the schools of the missionaries, and the\r\nhabit of reading is fast obliterating the original religion and\r\nsuperstitions of the race.\r\n\r\nOf the _Kingsmill Group_, we possess a very sad account; one named\r\nDrummond's Island, which is of coral formation, is about thirty miles\r\nlong, and about three-quarters of a mile in width.  The island is\r\ncovered with cocoa-nut and pandanus trees, but not a patch of grass was\r\nseen.  The character of these islanders is of the most savage kind;\r\ntheir ferocity led to the belief that they are cannibals; one seaman of\r\nthe expedition was carried off, and all attempts to rescue him were\r\nunavailing.  Clad in coats of mail, and helmets made of the skin of a\r\nhorny kind of fish, with weapons of the most frightful character, formed\r\nfrom the teeth of some of the voracious monsters of the deep, they\r\nappeared to the number of more than five hundred, prepared for\r\nresistance; their numbers continuing to increase.  The officer in\r\ncommand, considered it both useless and dangerous to continue on the\r\nland.  Failing to procure the desired end, prior to returning, the\r\ncommanding officer determined to show the power of their arms, and\r\nhaving shot the leader of the savages dead, by a rocket and a volley,\r\nset their town, which was close to the beach, in flames; and the houses\r\nbeing formed of easily combustible material, a very short time sufficed\r\nto reduce the whole to ashes.  The number of houses was supposed to be\r\nabout three hundred.\r\n\r\nThe people appear to be under no control whatever, and possess little of\r\nthe characteristic hospitality usually found among other savage tribes.\r\n\r\nIt was observed that their treatment of each other exhibited a great\r\nwant of feeling; and in many instances their practices were indicative\r\nof the lowest state of barbarism.  Their young girls are freely offered\r\nfor sale by their fathers and brothers, and without concealment; and to\r\ndrive a bargain is the principal object of their visits to a ship.\r\n\r\nThe _Kingsmill Group_, which consists of fifteen islands, are all of\r\ncoral formation--every one appears a continuous grove of cocoa-nut and\r\npandanus trees--they are all densely inhabited.  From one of these\r\nislands, John Kirby, a deserter from an English whaler, was taken, who\r\nhad resided there three years.  He stated that the natives do sometimes\r\neat human flesh; but their general food is fish.  That these islands\r\nhave been peopled at a period not very remote is tolerably certain, as\r\nthe natives state that only a few generations back, the people were\r\nfewer than at present, and that then there were no wars.\r\n\r\nThe islanders of this group differ from other Polynesians, and they more\r\nnearly resemble the Malays.  They are of a dark copper colour, are of\r\nmiddle size, well-made, and slender.  Their hair is fine, black, and\r\nglossy--their beards and moustaches black, and fine as the hair of their\r\nheads.  The average height of the men is five feet eight inches.  The\r\nwomen are much smaller--they have delicate features, slight figures, and\r\nare generally pretty.\r\n\r\nThe _Feejee Group_ excel all other islands of Polynesia in their\r\nluxuriant and picturesque beauty--they produce all kinds of tropical\r\nfruits and vegetables--the bread-fruit, of which there are nine kinds,\r\nflourishes in great perfection; the banana, cocoa-nut, and chestnut, the\r\norange, the lemon, and the guava, the pine-apple, and the nutmeg, are\r\nall to be found; and the yam, which attains the length of above four\r\nfeet, is the principal food of the inhabitants; besides these, the\r\nsugar-cane and turmeric are largely cultivated, and different varieties\r\nare found growing wild.  Although the Feejeeans have made considerable\r\nprogress in several useful arts, they are in many respects the most\r\nbarbarous and savage race now existing upon the globe.  Having had\r\nconsiderable intercourse with white men, some effect has been produced\r\nin their political condition, but it has had no effect in mitigating the\r\nferocity of their character.  Messrs. Lythe and Hunt, missionaries at\r\nVuna, one of the Feejees, have given a circumstantial account of a\r\ncannibal feast, for the preparation of which they were eye-witnesses.\r\nThe missionaries having heard rumours that the king had sent for some\r\nmen belonging to a refractory town not far from the capital, with the\r\nintention of killing them, and afterwards feasting on their bodies, they\r\nwent to the old king to urge him to desist from so horrid and barbarous\r\na repast, and warned him that a time would come when he would be\r\npunished for it.  The king referred them to his son; but the savage\r\npropensities of the latter rendered it impossible for them to turn the\r\nsavage from his barbarous purpose.  They afterwards saw the bodies cut\r\nup and cooked.  On two of these islands, however, the efforts of\r\nmissionaries have been rewarded with some success; for the Reverend Mr\r\nCalvert, belonging to the Wesleyan society, assured the officers of the\r\nexpedition, that in those islands heathenism was fast passing away, and\r\nthat cannibalism was there extinct; but it must be observed that many of\r\nthe residents on those two islands were Tongese, among whom it is well\r\nknown the light of the gospel of Christ has long prevailed.\r\n\r\nOn one of those isles are five hot springs, the temperature of which is\r\n200 degrees; the rocks in the neighbourhood is of volcanic creation--\r\nthere is no smell of sulphur unless the head is held close to the water;\r\nbut the water has a very strong bitter saline taste.  These springs are\r\nused by the natives to boil their yams, which it does simply by putting\r\nthem into the springs, and covering them with grass and leaves, and,\r\nalthough the water had scarcely any appearance of boiling before, rapid\r\nebullition ensues.  The yams are well done in fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nThe population of the Feejee Group is supposed to be about 130,000.\r\nTheir towns are all on the sea-shore, as the chief food is fish.  The\r\nFeejeeans are very ingenious at canoe-building and carpentry, and,\r\ncurious enough, the barber is a most important personage, as they take\r\ngreat pains and pride in dressing their hair.  Their houses are from\r\ntwenty to thirty feet in length, and about fifteen feet in height--all\r\nhave fireplaces, as they cook their food, which is done in jars, very\r\nlike an oil jar in form.\r\n\r\nAll these isles are girt by white encircling reefs, which, standing out\r\nat some distance from the shore, forms a natural harbour, so that when a\r\nvessel has once entered, it is as secure as in an artificial dock.\r\nThere is generally but one entrance through the reef, and the difficulty\r\nof discovering it is well described by the Young Crusoes.  Each one has\r\nits own peculiar beauty; but Ovolan exceeds all others; it is the\r\nhighest, the most broken, and the most picturesque.\r\n\r\nHaving thus introduced our readers to the scene of these adventures, we\r\nproceed to give the narrative in the words of the journalist of the\r\nYoung Castaways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE TROPICAL ISLAND.\r\n\r\nA COCOA-PALM--VIEWS OF DESERT ISLAND LIFE.\r\n\r\n  \"O had we some bright little isle of our own,\r\n  In the blue summer ocean, far-off and alone.\"\r\n\r\nWandering along the shore, (taking care to keep in sight of Mr Frazer,\r\nunder whose convoy, in virtue of his double-barrelled fowling-piece, we\r\nconsidered ourselves), we came to a low and narrow point, running out a\r\nlittle way into the sea, the extremity of which was adorned by a stately\r\ngroup of cocoa-nut trees.\r\n\r\nThe spot seemed ill adapted to support vegetation of so magnificent a\r\ngrowth, and nothing less hardy than the cocoa-palm could have derived\r\nnourishment from such a soil.  Several of these fine trees stood almost\r\nat the water's edge, springing from a bed of sand, mingled with black\r\nbasaltic pebbles, and coarse fragments of shells and coral, where their\r\nroots were washed by every rising tide: yet their appearance was thrifty\r\nand flourishing, and they were thickly covered with close-packed bunches\r\nof tassel-like, straw-coloured blossoms, and loaded with fruit in\r\nvarious stages of growth.\r\n\r\nJohnny cast a wistful glance at the compact clusters of nuts, nestling\r\nbeneath the graceful tufts of long leaves that crowned each straight and\r\ntapering trunk; but he had so recently learned from experience, the\r\nhopelessness of undertaking to climb a cocoa-nut tree, that he was not\r\nat present disposed to renew the attempt.  Max, however, who greatly\r\nvalued himself upon his agility, and professed to be able to do any\r\nthing that could be done, in the way of climbing, manifested an\r\nintention to hazard his reputation by making the doubtful experiment.\r\nAfter looking carefully around, he selected for the attempt, a young\r\ntree near the shore, growing at a considerable inclination from the\r\nperpendicular; and clasping it firmly, he slowly commenced climbing, or\r\nrather creeping, along the slanting trunk, while Johnny watched the\r\noperation from below, with an interest as intense as if the fate of\r\nempires depended upon the result.\r\n\r\nMax, who evidently considered his character at stake, and who climbed\r\nfor \"glory,\" rather than for cocoa-nuts, proceeded with caution and\r\nperseverance.  Once he partly lost his hold, and swung round to the\r\nunder side of the trunk, but by a resolute and vigorous effort he\r\npromptly recovered his position, and finally succeeded in establishing\r\nhimself quite comfortably among the enormous leaves that drooped from\r\nthe top of the tree.  Here he seemed disposed to rest for a while, after\r\nhis arduous and triumphant exertions, and he sat, looking complacently\r\ndown upon us from his elevated position, without making any attempt to\r\nsecure the fruit which hung within his reach in abundant clusters.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Johnny, capering about and clapping his hands with glee,\r\nas soon as this much desired consummation was attained, \"Now, Max, pitch\r\ndown the nuts!\"\r\n\r\nHaving teased Johnny, and enjoyed the impatience caused by the\r\ntantalising deliberation of his own movements, Max detached two entire\r\nclusters of nuts from the tree, which furnished us an abundant supply.\r\n\r\nSelecting a pleasant spot beside the beach, we sat down to discuss the\r\ncocoa-nuts at our leisure, which occupied us some little time.  Upon\r\nlooking round, after we had finished, we discovered that our convoy had\r\ndisappeared, and Johnny, whose imagination was continually haunted by\r\nvisionary savages and cannibals, manifested considerable uneasiness upon\r\nfinding that we were alone.\r\n\r\nAs the sun was already low in the west, and we supposed that the party\r\nengaged in getting wood had, in all probability, finished their work, we\r\nconcluded to return, and to wait for Mr Frazer, and the rest of the\r\nshore party at the boats, if we should not find them already there.\r\n\r\nAs we skirted the border of the grove, on our return, Johnny every now\r\nand then cast an uneasy glance towards its darkening recesses, as though\r\nexpecting to see some wild animal, or a yelling troop of tattooed\r\nislanders rush out upon us.  The forest commenced about two hundred\r\nyards from the beach, from which there was a gradual ascent and was\r\ncomposed of a greater variety of trees than I had observed on the other\r\nislands of a similar size at which we had previously landed.  Arthur\r\ncalled our attention to a singular and picturesque group of\r\nTournefortias, in the midst of which, like a patriarch surrounded by his\r\nfamily, stood one of uncommon size, and covered with a species of fern,\r\nwhich gave it a striking and remarkable appearance.  The group covered a\r\nlittle knoll, that crowned a piece of rising ground, advanced a short\r\ndistance beyond the edge of the forest.  It was a favourable spot for a\r\nsurvey of the scene around us.  The sun, now hastening to his setting,\r\nwas tingeing all the western ocean with a rich vermilion glow.  The\r\nsmooth white beach before us, upon which the long-rolling waves broke in\r\neven succession, retired in a graceful curve to the right and was broken\r\non the left by the wooded point already mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs you looked inland, the undulating surface of the island, rising\r\ngradually from the shore, and covered with the wild and luxuriant\r\nvegetation of the tropics, delighted the eye by its beauty and variety.\r\nThe noble Bread-fruit tree--its arching branches clothed with its\r\npeculiarly rich and glossy foliage; the elegantly shaped Casuarina, the\r\nluxuriant Pandanus, and the Palms, with their stately trunks, and green\r\ncrests of nodding leaves, imparted to the scene a character of oriental\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n\"Why do they call so lovely a spot as this a desert island, I wonder?\"\r\nexclaimed Johnny, after gazing around him a few moments in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of a desert island that wasn't a lovely spot!\"\r\nanswered Max.  \"Why, your regular desert island should combine the\r\nrichest productions of the temperate, torrid, and frigid zones--a choice\r\nselection of the fruits, flowers, vegetables, and animal; of Europe,\r\nAsia, and Africa.  This would by no means come up to the average\r\nstandard.  I doubt if you could find upon it so much as a goat or a\r\npoll-parrot much less an `onager,' a buffalo, or a boa-constrictor, some\r\nof which at least are indispensable to a desert island of any\r\nrespectability.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, do they call such delightful places desert islands!\"\r\nrepeated Johnny.  \"I always thought a desert was a barren wilderness,\r\nwhere there was nothing to be seen but sand, and rocks, and Arabs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe they are more properly called _desolate_ islands,\" said\r\nArthur; \"and that seems proper enough; for even this island with all its\r\nbeauty, is supposed to be uninhabited, and it would be a very lonely and\r\n_desolate_ home.  Would you like to live here, Johnny, like Robinson\r\nCrusoe, or the Swiss family?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not all alone, like Robinson Crusoe.  O no! that would be horrible; but\r\nI think we might all of us together live here beautifully a little\r\nwhile, if we had plenty of provisions, and plenty of arms to defend\r\nourselves against the savages; and then of course we should want a house\r\nto live in, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said Max, \"what should we want of provisions?--the sea is\r\nfull of fish, and the forest of birds; the trees are loaded with fruit;\r\nthere are oysters and other shell-fish in the bays, and no doubt there\r\nare various roots, good for food, to be had by digging for them.  As to\r\na house, we might sleep very comfortably, in such weather as this, under\r\nthese Tournefortias, and never so much as think of taking cold; or we\r\ncould soon build a serviceable hut, which would be proof against sun and\r\nrain, of the trunks and boughs of trees, with a thatch of palm-leaves\r\nfor a roof.  Then in regard to arms, of course, if it should be our fate\r\nto set up for desert islanders, we should be well supplied in that line.\r\nI never heard of any one, from Robinson Crusoe down, being cast away on\r\na desert island, without a good store of guns, pistols, cutlasses,\r\netcetera, etcetera.  Such a thing would be contrary to all precedent,\r\nand is not for a moment to be dreamed of.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we haven't any arms,\" said Johnny, \"except those old rusty\r\ncutlasses that Spot put into the yawl, and if we should be cast away, or\r\nleft here, for instance, where should we get them from?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, but we are not cast away yet,\" replied Max.  \"This is the way the\r\nthing always happens.  When people are cast away, it is in a ship, of\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes; I suppose so,\" said Johnny, rather doubtfully.  \"Well--the\r\nship is always abundantly supplied with every thing necessary to a\r\ndesert island life; she is driven ashore; the castaways--the future\r\ndesert islanders--by dint of wonderful good fortune, get safely to land;\r\nthe rest of course are all drowned, and so disposed of; then, in due\r\ntime, the ship goes to pieces, and every thing needful is washed ashore\r\nand secured by the islanders--that's the regular course of things--isn't\r\nit, Arthur!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I believe it is, according to the story-books, which are the\r\nstandard sources of information on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or sometimes,\" pursued Max, \"the ship gets comfortably wedged in\r\nbetween two convenient rocks, (which seem to have been designed for that\r\nspecial purpose), so that the castaways can go out to it on a raft, or\r\nfloat of some kind, and carry off every thing they want--and singularly\r\nenough, although the vessel is always on the point of going to pieces,\r\nthat catastrophe never takes place, until every thing which can be of\r\nany use is secured.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose, Arthur,\" inquired Johnny, \"that there are many\r\nuninhabited islands, that have never been discovered!\"\r\n\r\n\"There are believed to be a great many of them,\" answered Arthur, \"and\r\nit is supposed that new ones are constantly being formed by the labours\r\nof the coral insect.  A bare ledge of coral first appears, just at the\r\nsurface; it arrests floating substances, weeds, trees, etcetera; soon\r\nthe sea-birds begin to resort there; by the decay of vegetable and\r\nanimal matter a thin soil gradually covers the foundation of coral; a\r\ncocoa-nut is drifted upon it by the winds, or the currents of the sea;\r\nit takes root, springs up, its fruit ripens and falls, and in a few\r\nyears the whole new-formed island is covered with waving groves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr Frazer says he has no doubt that these seas swarm with such\r\nislands, and that many of them have never been discovered,\" said Max;\r\nbesides, here's poetry for it:--\r\n\r\n  \"`O many are the beauteous isles,\r\n  Unseen by human eye,\r\n  That sleeping 'mid the Ocean smiles,\r\n  In happy silence lie.\r\n  The ship may pass them in the night,\r\n  Nor the sailors know what lovely sight\r\n  Is sleeping on the main;'\r\n\r\n\"But this poetical testimony will make Arthur doubt the fact\r\naltogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" answered Arthur, \"though I am free to admit that without\r\nMr Frazer's opinion to back it your poetical testimony would not go\r\nvery far with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark!  There go Mr Frazer's two barrels,\" cried Max, as two reports in\r\nquick succession were heard, coming apparently from the grove, in the\r\ndirection of the spring; \"he has probably come across a couple of `rare\r\nspecimens,' to be added to his stuffed collection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE ALARM AND THE CONFLICT.\r\n\r\nTHE MUTINEERS--THE RACE FOR LIFE--THE CORAL LEDGE--A FINAL EFFORT--A\r\nBRIEF WARNING--THE STRANGE SAIL.\r\n\r\n  \"Now bend the straining rowers to their oars;\r\n  Fast the light shallops leave the lessening shores,\r\n  No rival crews in emulous sport contend,\r\n  But life and death upon the event depend.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment we were startled by a quick, fierce shout, followed\r\nimmediately by a long, piercing, and distressful cry, proceeding from\r\nthe same quarter from which the reports of fire-arms had been heard; and\r\nbefore we had time to conjecture the cause or meaning of these frightful\r\nsounds, Morton bounded like a deer from the grove, about a hundred yards\r\nfrom the spot where we were standing, and ran swiftly towards us, crying\r\nout--\"To the boats! for your lives to the boats!\"\r\n\r\nOur first thought was, that the party at the spring had been attacked\r\nand massacred by the natives.  Arthur seized Johnny by one hand, and\r\nmotioned to me to take the other, which I did, and without stopping to\r\ndemand any explanations, we started at a rapid pace, in the direction of\r\nthe yawl, Max taking the lead--Arthur and myself, dragging Johnny\r\nbetween us, coming next, and Morton a few paces behind us, bringing up\r\nthe rear.  It took but a few moments to enable us to reach the spot\r\nwhere the yawl lay, hauled up upon the beach.  There was no one in her,\r\nor in sight, except Browne, who was comfortably stretched out near the\r\nboat sound asleep, with an open book lying beside him.\r\n\r\nMorton aroused the sleeper by a violent shake.  \"Now, then,\" cried he,\r\n\"let us get the boat into the water; the tide is down, and the yawl is\r\nheavy; we shall want all the strength we can muster.\"\r\n\r\nBy a united effort we got the yawl to the edge of the surf.\r\n\r\nBrowne, though not yet thoroughly awake, could not but observe our pale\r\nfaces and excited appearance, and gazing from one to another in a\r\nbewildered manner, he asked what was the matter; but no one made any\r\nanswer.  Morton lifted Johnny into the boat and asked the rest of us to\r\nget in, except Arthur, saying that they two would push her through the\r\nsurf.\r\n\r\n\"Hold!\" cried Arthur, \"let us not be too fast; some of the others may\r\nescape the savages, and they will naturally run this way--we must not\r\nleave them to be murdered.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no savages in the case,\" answered Morton, \"and there is no\r\ntime to be lost; the men have killed the first officer, and Mr Frazer,\r\ntoo, I fear; and they will take the ship and commit more murders, unless\r\nwe can get there before them, to warn those on board.\"\r\n\r\nThis was more horrible than any thing that we had anticipated; but we\r\nhad no time to dwell upon it: the sound of oars rattling in the\r\nrow-locks, was heard from beyond the point.\r\n\r\n\"There are the mutineers!\" cried Morton; \"but I think that we have the\r\nadvantage of them; they must pull round yonder point, which will make at\r\nleast a quarter of a mile's difference in the distance to the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no use in trying to get to the ship before them,\" said Max,\r\n\"the long-boat pulls eight oars, and there are men enough to fill her.\"\r\n\r\n\"There _is_ use in trying; it would be shameful _not_ to try; if they\r\npull most oars, ours is the lightest boat,\" answered Morton with\r\nvehemence.\r\n\r\n\"It us out of the question,\" said Browne; \"see, is there any hope that\r\nwe can succeed?\" and he pointed to the bow of the long-boat just\r\nappearing from behind the point.\r\n\r\n\"O, but this is not right!--Browne!  Max! in the name of all that is\r\nhonourable, let us make the attempt,\" urged Morton, laying a hand in an\r\nimploring manner on the arm of each.  \"Shall we let them take the ship\r\nand murder our friends, without an effort to warn them of their danger?\r\nYou, Arthur, are for making the attempt, I know--this delay is wrong:\r\nthe time is precious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, let us try it,\" said Arthur, glancing rapidly from the long-boat\r\nto the ship, \"if we fail, no harm is done, except that we incur the\r\nanger of the mutineers.  I, for one, am willing to take the risk.\"\r\n\r\nMax sprang into the boat, and seized an oar without another word.\r\n\r\n\"_You_ know well, that I am willing to share any danger with the rest,\r\nand that it was not the danger that made me hesitate,\" said Browne,\r\nlaying his hand on Morton's shoulder, and looking earnestly into his\r\nface; and then, in his usual deliberate manner, he followed Max's\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nMorton, Arthur, and myself now pushed the boat into the surf and sprang\r\nin.  At Arthur's request, I took the rudder; he and Morton seized the\r\ntwo remaining oars, and the four commenced pulling with a degree of\r\ncoolness and vigour, that would not have disgraced older and more\r\npractised oarsmen.  As I saw the manner in which they bent to their\r\nwork, and the progress we were making, I began to think our chance of\r\nreaching the ship before the crew of the long-boat, by no means\r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\nMorton, in spite of his slender figure and youthful appearance, which\r\nhis fresh, ruddy complexion, blue eyes, and brown curling locks,\r\nrendered almost effeminate, possessed extraordinary strength, and\r\nindomitable energy.\r\n\r\nBrowne, though his rather heavy frame and breadth of shoulders gave him\r\nthe appearance of greater strength than he actually possessed, was\r\nundoubtedly capable, when aroused, of more powerful temporary exertion\r\nthan any other of our number; though in point of activity and endurance,\r\nhe would scarcely equal Morton or Arthur.  Max, too, was vigorous and\r\nactive, and, when stimulated by danger or emulation, was capable of\r\npowerful effort.  Arthur, though of slight and delicate frame, was\r\ncompact and well knit, and his coolness, judgment and resolution,\r\nenabled him to dispose of his strength to the best advantage.  All were\r\nanimated by that high and generous spirit which is of greater value in\r\nan emergency than any amount of mere physical strength; a spirit which\r\noften stimulates the feeble to efforts as surprising to him who puts\r\nthem forth, as to those who witness them.\r\n\r\nBrowne had the bow-oar, and putting his whole force into every stroke,\r\nwas pulling like a giant.  Morton, who was on the same side, handled his\r\noar with less excitement and effort but with greater precision and equal\r\nefficiency.  It was plain that these two were pulling Max and Arthur\r\nround, and turning the boat from her course; and as I had not yet\r\nsucceeded in shipping the rudder, which was rendered difficult by the\r\nrising and falling of the boat, and the sudden impulse she received from\r\nevery stroke, I requested Browne and Morton to pull more gently.  Just\r\nas I had succeeded in getting the rudder hung, the crew of the long-boat\r\nseemed to have first observed us.  They had cleared the point to the\r\nsouthward, and we were, perhaps, a hundred yards nearer the long point,\r\nbeyond which we could see the masts of the ship, and on doubling which,\r\nwe should be almost within hail of her.  The latter point, was probably\r\na little more than half a mile distant from us, and towards the head of\r\nit, both boats were steering.  The long-boat was pulling eight oars, and\r\nLuerson, the man who had had the difficulty with the first officer at\r\nthe Kingsmill Islands, was at the helm.  As soon as he observed us, he\r\nappeared to speak to the crew of his boat, and they commenced pulling\r\nwith greater vigour than before.  He then hailed us,--\"Holloa, lads!\r\nwhere's Frazer?  Are you going to leave him on the island!\"\r\n\r\nWe pulled on in silence.\r\n\r\n\"He is looking for you now, somewhere along shore; he left us, just\r\nbelow the point, to find you; you had better pull back and bring him\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"All a trick,\" said Morton; \"don't waste any breath with them;\" and we\r\nbent to the oars with new energy.\r\n\r\n\"The young scamps mean to give the alarm,\" I could hear Luerson mutter\r\nwith an oath, as he surveyed, for a moment, the interval between the two\r\nboats, and then the distance to the point.\r\n\r\n\"There's no use of mincing matters, my lads,\" he cried, standing up in\r\nthe stem; \"we have knocked the first officer on the head, and served\r\nsome of those who didn't approve of the proceeding in the same way; and\r\nnow we are going to take the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"We know it, and intend to prevent you,\" cried Morton, panting with the\r\nviolence of his exertions.\r\n\r\n\"Unship your oars till we pass you, and you shall not be hurt,\" pursued\r\nLuerson in the same breath; \"pull another stroke at them, and I will\r\nserve you like your friend, Frazer, and he lies at the spring with his\r\nthroat slit!\"\r\n\r\nThe ruffian's design, in this savage threat, was doubtless to terrify us\r\ninto submission; or, at least, so to appal and agitate us, as to make\r\nour exertions more confused and feeble.  In this last calculation he may\r\nhave been partially correct, for the threat was fearful, and the danger\r\nimminent; the harsh, deep tones of his voice, with the ferocious\r\ndetermination of his manner, sent a thrill of horror to every heart.\r\nMore than this, he could not effect; there was not a craven spirit among\r\nour number.\r\n\r\n\"Steadily!\" said Arthur, in a low, collected tone; \"less than five\r\nminutes will bring us within hail of the ship.\"\r\n\r\nBut the minutes seemed hours, amid such tremendous exertions, and such\r\nintense anxiety.  The sweat streamed from the faces of the rowers; they\r\ngasped and panted for breath; the swollen veins stood out on their\r\nforeheads.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" cried Luerson, after a pause, \"perhaps there is some one in\r\nthat boat who desires to save his life; whoever drops his oar shall not\r\nbe harmed; the rest die.\"\r\n\r\nA scornful laugh from Morton was the only answer to this tempting offer.\r\n\r\nLuerson now stooped for a moment and seemed to be groping for something\r\nin the bottom of the boat.  When he rose, it was with a musket or\r\nfowling-piece in his hands, which he cocked, and, coming forward to the\r\nbow, levelled towards us.\r\n\r\n\"Once more,\" he cried, \"and once for all, drop your oars, or I fire\r\namong you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it is loaded,\" said Arthur, \"or he would have used it\r\nsooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is Frazer's gun,\" said Morton, \"and he fired both barrels\r\nbefore they murdered him; there has been no time to reload it.\"\r\n\r\nThe event showed the truth of these suspicions; for, upon seeing that\r\nhis threat produced no effect, Luerson resumed his seat in the bows, the\r\nhelm having been given to one of the men not at the oars.\r\n\r\nWe were now close upon the point, and, as I glanced from our pursuers to\r\nthe ship, I began to breathe more freely.  They had gained upon us; but\r\nit was inch by inch, and the goal was now at hand.  The long-boat,\r\nthough pulling eight oars, and those of greater length than ours, was a\r\nclumsier boat than the yawl, and at present heavily loaded; we had\r\nalmost held our own with them thus far.\r\n\r\nBut now Luerson sprang up once more in the bow of the long-boat, and\r\npresented towards us the weapon with which he had a moment before\r\nthreatened us; and this time it was no idle menace.  A puff of smoke\r\nrose from the muzzle of the piece, and, just as the sharp report reached\r\nour ears, Browne uttered a quick exclamation of pain, and let fall his\r\noar.\r\n\r\nFor a moment all was confusion and alarm; but Browne, who had seized his\r\noar again almost instantly, declared that he was not hurt; that the ball\r\nhad merely grazed the skin of his arm; and he attempted to recommence\r\nrowing; before, however, he had pulled half-a-dozen strokes, his right\r\nhand was covered with the blood which streamed down his arm.\r\n\r\nI now insisted on taking his oar, and he took my place at the helm.\r\n\r\nWhile this change was being effected, our pursuers gained upon us\r\nperceptibly.  Every moment was precious.  Luerson urged his men to\r\ngreater efforts; the turning point of the struggle was now at hand, and\r\nthe excitement became terrible.\r\n\r\n\"Steer close in; it will save something in distance,\" gasped Morton,\r\nalmost choking for breath.\r\n\r\n\"Not too close,\" panted Arthur; \"don't get us aground.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no danger of that,\" answered Morton, \"it is deep, off the\r\npoint.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost as he spoke, a sharp, grating sound was heard, beneath the bottom\r\nof the boat, and our progress was arrested with a suddenness that threw\r\nMax and myself from our seats.  We were upon a ledge of coral, which at\r\na time of less excitement we could scarcely have failed to have observed\r\nand avoided, from the manner in which the sea broke upon it.\r\n\r\nA shout of mingled exultation and derision, as they witnessed this\r\ndisaster, greeted us from the long-boat, which was ploughing through the\r\nwater, but a little way behind us, and some twenty yards further out\r\nfrom the shore.\r\n\r\n\"It is all up,\" said Morton, bitterly, dropping his oar.\r\n\r\n\"Back water!  Her stern still swings free,\" cried Arthur, \"the next\r\nswell will lift her clear.\"\r\n\r\nWe got as far aft as possible, to lighten the bows; a huge wave broke\r\nupon the ledge, and drenched us with spray, but the yawl still grated\r\nupon the coral.\r\n\r\nLuerson probably deemed himself secure of a more convenient opportunity,\r\nat no distant period, to wreak his vengeance upon us: at any rate there\r\nwas no time for it now; he merely menaced us with his clenched fist, as\r\nthey swept by.  Almost at the same moment a great sea came rolling\r\nsmoothly in, and, as our oars dipped to back water, we floated free:\r\nthen a few vigorous strokes carried us to a safe distance from the\r\ntreacherous shoal.\r\n\r\n\"One effort more!\" cried Arthur, as the mutineers disappeared behind the\r\npoint; \"we are not yet too late to give them a warning, though it will\r\nbe but a short one.\"\r\n\r\nAgain we bent to the oars, and in a moment we too had doubled the point,\r\nand were in the wake of the long-boat.  The ship lay directly before us,\r\nand within long hailing distance.\r\n\r\n\"Now, comrades, let us shout together, and try to make them understand\r\ntheir danger,\" said Browne, standing up in the stern.\r\n\r\n\"A dozen strokes more,\" said Arthur, \"and we can do it with more certain\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\nLuerson merely glanced back at us, as he once more heard the dash of our\r\noars; but he took no farther notice of us: the crisis was too close at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nOn board the ship all seemed quiet.  Some of the men were gathered\r\ntogether on the starboard bow, apparently engaged in fishing; they did\r\nnot seem to notice the approach of the boats.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then!\" cried Arthur, at length, unshipping his oar, and springing\r\nto his feet, \"one united effort to attract their attention--all\r\ntogether--now, then!\" and we sent up a cry that echoed wildly across the\r\nwater, and startled the idlers congregated at the bows, who came running\r\nto the side of the vessel nearest us.\r\n\r\n\"We have got their attention; now hail them,\" said Arthur, turning to\r\nBrowne, who had a deep powerful voice; \"tell them not to let the\r\nlong-boat board them.\"\r\n\r\nBrowne put his hands to his mouth, and in tones that could have been\r\ndistinctly heard twice the distance, shouted--\"Look-out for the\r\nlong-boat--don't let them board you--the men have killed the first\r\nofficer, and want to take the ship!\"  From the stir and confusion that\r\nfollowed, it was clear that the warning was understood.\r\n\r\nBut the mutineers were now scarcely twenty yards from the vessel,\r\ntowards which they were ploughing their way with unabated speed.  The\r\nnext moment they were under her bows; just as their oars flew into the\r\nair, we could hear a deep voice from the deck, sternly ordering them to\r\n\"keep off,\" and I thought that I could distinguish Captain Erskine\r\nstanding near the bowsprit.\r\n\r\nThe mutineers gave no heed to the order; several of them sprang into the\r\nchains, and Luerson among the rest.  A fierce, though unequal struggle,\r\nat once commenced.  The captain, armed with a weapon which he wielded\r\nwith both hands, and which I took to be a capstan-bar, struck right and\r\nleft among the boarders as they attempted to gain the deck, and one, at\r\nleast of them, fell back with a heavy plunge into the water.  But the\r\ncaptain seemed to be almost unsupported; and the mutineers had nearly\r\nall reached the deck, and were pressing upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but this is a cruel sight!\" said Browne, turning away with a\r\nshudder.  \"Comrades, can we do nothing more?\"\r\n\r\nMorton, who had been groping beneath the sail in the bottom of the boat\r\nnow dragged forth the cutlasses which Spot had insisted on placing there\r\nwhen we went ashore.\r\n\r\n\"Here are arms!\" he exclaimed, \"we are not such boys, but that we can\r\ntake a part in what is going on--let us pull to the ship!\"\r\n\r\n\"What say you!\" cried Arthur, glancing inquiringly from one to another;\r\n\"we can't, perhaps, do much, but shall we sit here and see Mr Erskine\r\nmurdered, without _trying_ to help him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Friends, let us to the ship!\" cried Browne, with deep emotion, \"I am\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I!\" gasped Max, pale with excitement, \"we can but be killed.\"\r\n\r\nCan we hope to turn the scale of this unequal strife? shall we do more\r\nthan arrive at the scene of conflict in time to experience the vengeance\r\nof the victorious mutineers?--such were the thoughts that flew hurriedly\r\nthrough my mind.  I was entirely unaccustomed to scenes of violence and\r\nbloodshed, and my head swam, and my heart sickened, as I gazed at the\r\nconfused conflict raging on the vessel's deck, and heard the shouts and\r\ncries of the combatants.  Yet I felt an inward recoil against the\r\nbaseness of sitting an idle spectator of such a struggle.  A glance at\r\nthe lion-hearted Erskine still maintaining the unequal fight, was an\r\nappeal to every noble and generous feeling: it nerved me for the\r\nattempt, and though I trembled as I grasped an oar, it was with\r\nexcitement and eagerness, not with fear.\r\n\r\nThe yawl had hardly received the first impulse in the direction of the\r\nship, when the report of fire-arms was heard.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful heavens!\" cried Morton, \"the captain is down! that fiend\r\nLuerson has shot him!\"\r\n\r\nThe figure which I had taken for that of Mr Erskine, was no longer to\r\nbe distinguished among the combatants, some person was now dragged to\r\nthe side of the ship towards us, and thrown overboard; he sunk after a\r\nfeeble struggle; a triumphant shout followed, and then two men were seen\r\nrunning up the rigging.\r\n\r\n\"There goes poor Spot up to the foretop,\" said Max, pointing to one of\r\nthe figures in the rigging; \"he can only gain time at the best but it\r\ncan't be that they'll kill him in cold blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Luerson is just the man to do it,\" answered Morton; \"the faithful\r\nfellow has stood by the captain, and that will seal his fate--look! it\r\nis as I said,\" and I could see some one pointing, what was doubtless Mr\r\nFrazer's fowling-piece, at the figure in the foretop.  A parley seemed\r\nto follow; as the result of which, the fugitive came down and\r\nsurrendered himself.  The struggle now appeared to be over, and quiet\r\nwas once more restored.\r\n\r\nSo rapidly had these events passed, and so stunning was their effect,\r\nthat it was some moments before we could collect our thoughts, or fully\r\nrealise our situation; and we sat, silent and bewildered, gazing toward\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nMax was the first to break silence; \"And now, what's to be done?\" he\r\nsaid, \"as to going aboard, that is of course out of the question: the\r\nship is no longer our home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what we can do,\" said Morton, \"except to pull ashore, and\r\nstand the chance of being taken off by some vessel, before we starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is something better,\" cried Max eagerly, pointing out to sea; and,\r\nlooking in the direction indicated, we saw a large ship, with all her\r\nsails set, steering directly for us, or so nearly so, as to make it\r\napparent that if she held on her present course, she must pass very near\r\nto us.  Had we not been entirely engrossed by what was taking place\r\nimmediately around us, we could not have failed to have seen her sooner,\r\nas she must have been in sight a considerable time.\r\n\r\n\"They have already seen her on board,\" said Morton, \"and that accounts\r\nfor their great hurry in getting up anchor; they don't feel like being\r\nneighbourly just now, with strange vessels.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, there was every indication on board of our own ship, of haste,\r\nand eagerness to be gone.  While some of the men were at the capstan,\r\ngetting up the anchor, others were busy in the rigging, and sail after\r\nsail was rapidly spread to the breeze, so that by the time the anchor\r\nwas at the bows, the ship began to move slowly through the water.\r\n\r\n\"They don't seem to consider us of much account anyway,\" said Max, \"they\r\nare going without so much as saying good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"They may know more of the stranger than we do,\" said Arthur, \"they have\r\nglasses on board; if she should be an American man-of-war, their hurry\r\nis easily explained.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help believing that they see or suspect more, in regard to her,\r\nthan appears to us,\" said Morton, \"or they would not fail to make an\r\nattempt to recover the yawl.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is rapidly getting dark,\" said Arthur, \"and I think we had better\r\nput up the sail, and steer for the stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" said Morton, \"for she may possibly tack before she sees us.\"\r\n\r\nMorton and myself proceeded to step the mast, and rig the sail;\r\nmeantime, Arthur got Browne's coat off, and examined and bandaged the\r\nwound on his arm, which had been bleeding all the while profusely; he\r\npronounced it to be but a trifling hurt.  A breeze from the south-east\r\nhad sprung up at sunset, and we now had a free wind to fill our sail, as\r\nwe steered directly out to sea to meet the stranger, which was still at\r\ntoo great a distance to make it probable that we had been seen by her\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt was with a feeling of anxiety and uneasiness, that I saw the faint\r\ntwilight fading away, with the suddenness usual in those latitudes, and\r\nthe darkness gathering rapidly round us.  Already the east was wrapped\r\nin gloom, and only a faint streak of light along the western horizon\r\nmarked the spot where the sun had so recently disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"How suddenly the night has come upon us,\" said Arthur, who had been\r\npeering through the dusk toward the approaching vessel, in anxious\r\nsilence; \"O, for twenty minutes more of daylight!  I fear that she is\r\nabout tacking.\"\r\n\r\nThis announcement filled us all with dismay, and every eye was strained\r\ntowards her with intense and painful interest.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the breeze had freshened somewhat and we now had rather more\r\nof it than we desired, as our little boat was but poorly fitted to\r\nnavigate the open ocean in rough weather.  Johnny began to manifest some\r\nalarm, as we were tossed like a chip from wave to wave, and occasionally\r\ndeluged with spray, by a sea bursting with a rude shock over our bow.  I\r\nhad not even in the violent storm of the preceding week, experienced\r\nsuch a sense of insecurity, such a feeling of helplessness, as now, when\r\nthe actual danger was comparatively slight.  The waves seemed tenfold\r\nlarger and more threatening than when viewed from the deck of a large\r\nvessel.  As we sunk into the trough of the sea, our horizon was\r\ncontracted to the breadth of half-a-dozen yards, and we entirely lost\r\nsight of the land, and of both ships.\r\n\r\nBut it was evident that we were moving through the water with\r\nconsiderable velocity, and there was encouragement in that, for we felt\r\nconfident that if the stranger should hold on her present course but a\r\nlittle longer, we should be on board of her before our safety would be\r\nseriously endangered by the increasing breeze.\r\n\r\nIf, however, she were really tacking, our situation would indeed be\r\ncritical.  A very few moments put a period to our suspense by confirming\r\nArthur's opinion, and our worst fears; the stranger had altered her\r\ncourse, her yards were braced round, and she was standing further out to\r\nsea.  Still, however, there would have been a possibility of reaching\r\nher, but for the failure of light, for she had not so far changed her\r\ncourse, but that she would have to pass a point, which we could probably\r\ngain before her.  But now, it was with difficulty, and only by means of\r\nthe cloud of canvass she carried, that we could distinguish her through\r\nthe momently deepening gloom; and with sinking hearts we relinquished\r\nthe last hopes connected with her.  Soon she entirely vanished from our\r\nsight, and when we gazed anxiously around the narrow horizon that now\r\nbounded our vision, sky and water alone met our view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nAT SEA.\r\n\r\nA NIGHT OF GLOOM--MORTON'S NARRATIVE--VISIONARY TERRORS--AN ALARMING\r\nDISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n  \"O'er the deep! o'er the deep!\r\n  Where the whale, and the shark, and the sword-fish sleep.\"\r\n\r\nEven in open day, the distance of a few miles would be sufficient to\r\nsink the low shores of the island; and now that night had so suddenly\r\novertaken us, it might be quite near, without our being able to\r\ndistinguish it.\r\n\r\nWe were even uncertain, and divided in opinion, as to the direction in\r\nwhich it lay--so completely were we bewildered.  The night was one of\r\ndeep and utter gloom.  There was no moon; and not a single star shed its\r\nfeeble light over the wilderness of agitated waters, upon which our\r\nlittle boat was tossing.  Heavy, low-hanging clouds, covered the sky;\r\nbut soon, even these could no longer be distinguished; a cold, damp\r\nmist, dense, and almost palpable to the touch, crept over the ocean, and\r\nenveloped us so closely, that it was impossible to see clearly from one\r\nend of the yawl to the other.\r\n\r\nThe wind, however, instead of freshening, as we had feared, died\r\ngradually away.  For this, we had reason to be thankful; for though our\r\nsituation that night seemed dismal enough, yet how much more fearful\r\nwould it have been, if the rage of the elements, and danger of immediate\r\ndestruction, had been added to the other circumstances of terror by\r\nwhich we were surrounded?\r\n\r\nAs it was, however, the sea having gone down, we supposed ourselves to\r\nbe in no great or pressing peril.  Though miserably uncomfortable, and\r\nsomewhat agitated and anxious, we yet confidently expected that the\r\nlight of morning would show us the land again.\r\n\r\nThe terrible and exciting scenes through which we had so recently\r\npassed, had completely exhausted us, and we were too much overwhelmed by\r\nthe suddenness of our calamity, and the novel situation in which we now\r\nfound ourselves, to be greatly disposed to talk.  Johnny sobbed himself\r\nasleep in Arthur's arms; and even Max's usual spirits seemed now to have\r\nquite forsaken him.  After the mast had been unstepped, and such\r\npreparations as our circumstances permitted were made, for passing the\r\nnight comfortably, Morton related all that he knew of what had taken\r\nplace on shore, previous to the alarm which he had given.\r\n\r\nI repeat the narrative as nearly as possible in his own words, not\r\nperhaps altogether as he related it on that night, for the circumstances\r\nwere not then favourable to a full and orderly account, but partly as I\r\nafterwards, in various conversations, gathered the particulars from him.\r\n\r\n\"You recollect,\" said he, \"that we separated at the boats; Mr Frazer\r\nand the rest of you, going along the shore towards the point, leaving\r\nBrowne declaiming Byron's Address to the Ocean, from the top of a coral\r\nblock, with myself and the breakers for an audience.  Shortly\r\nafterwards, I strolled off towards the interior, and left Browne lying\r\non the sand, with his pocket Shakespeare, where we found him, when we\r\nreached the boats.  I kept on inland, until the forest became so dense,\r\nand was so overgrown with tangled vines and creeping plants, that I\r\ncould penetrate no farther in that direction.  In endeavouring to\r\nreturn, I got bewildered, and at length fairly lost, having no clear\r\nnotion as to the direction of the beach.  The groves were so thick and\r\ndark as to shut out the light almost entirely; and I could not get a\r\nglimpse of the sun so as to fix the points of the compass.  At last I\r\ncame to an opening, large enough to let in the light, and show which way\r\nthe shadows fell.  Knowing that we had landed on the west side of the\r\nisland, I could now select my course without hesitation.  It was getting\r\nlate in the afternoon, and I walked as fast as the nature of the ground\r\nwould allow, until I unexpectedly found myself at the edge of the grove,\r\neast of the spring where the men were at work filling the breakers.  The\r\nmoment I came in sight of them, I perceived that something unusual was\r\ntaking place.  The first officer and Luerson were standing opposite each\r\nother, and the men, pausing from their work, were looking on.  As I\r\ninferred, Mr Nichol had given some order, which Luerson had refused to\r\nobey.  Both looked excited, but no words passed between them after I\r\nreached the place.  There was a pause of nearly a minute, when Mr\r\nNichol advanced as if to lay hands on Luerson, and the latter struck him\r\na blow with his cooper's mallet, which he held in his hand, and knocked\r\nhim down.  Before he had time to rise, Atoa, the Sandwich Islander,\r\nsprang upon him, and stabbed him twice with his belt-knife.  All this\r\npassed so rapidly, that no one had a chance to interfere--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\" said Browne, interrupting the narration, \"what noise is that?\r\nIt sounds like the breaking of the surf upon the shore.\"\r\n\r\nBut the rest of us could distinguish no sound except the washing of the\r\nwaves against the boat.  The eye was of no assistance in deciding\r\nwhether we were near the shore or not, as it was impossible to penetrate\r\nthe murky darkness, a yard in any direction.\r\n\r\n\"We must be vigilant,\" said Arthur, \"the land cannot be far-off, and we\r\nmay be drifted upon it before morning.\"\r\n\r\nAfter listening for some moments in anxious silence, we became satisfied\r\nthat Browne had been mistaken, and Morton proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"Just as Atoa sprang upon Mr Nichol and stabbed him, Mr Knight, who\r\nwas the first to recover his presence of mind, seized the murderer, and\r\nwrenched the knife from his hand, at the same time calling on the men to\r\nsecure Luerson; but no one stirred to do so.  A part seemed confused and\r\nundecided; while others appeared to me, to have been fully prepared for\r\nwhat had taken place.  One man stepped forward near Luerson, and\r\ndeclared in a brutal and excited manner, that `Nichol was a bloody\r\ntyrant, and had got what he deserved, and that no man could blame\r\nLuerson for taking his revenge, after being treated as he had been.'\r\nFor a moment all was clamour and confusion; then Luerson approached Mr\r\nKnight in a threatening manner, and bade him loose Atoa, instead of\r\nwhich, he held his prisoner firmly with one hand, and warning Luerson\r\noff with the other, called on the men to stand by their officers.  Just\r\nat this moment, Mr Frazer, with his gun on his shoulder, came out of\r\nthe grove from the side toward the shore, and to him Mr Knight eagerly\r\nappealed for assistance in securing the murderers of Mr Nichol.\r\nPointing from the bleeding corpse at his feet, to Luerson, he\r\nsaid--`There is the ringleader--shoot him through the head at once, and\r\nthat will finish the matter--otherwise we shall all be murdered--fire, I\r\nwill answer for the act?'\r\n\r\n\"Frazer seemed to comprehend the situation of things at a glance.  With\r\ngreat presence of mind, he stepped back a pace, and bringing his gun to\r\nhis shoulder, called on Luerson to throw down his weapon, and surrender\r\nhimself, declaring that he would shoot the first man who lifted a hand\r\nto assist him.  His manner was such as to leave no doubt of his\r\nsincerity, or his resolution.  The men had no fire-arms, and were\r\nstaggered by the suddenness of the thing; they stood hesitating and\r\nundecided.  Mr Knight seized this as a favourable moment, and advanced\r\nupon Luerson, with the intention of securing him, and the islander was\r\nthus left free.  At this moment I observed the man who had denounced Mr\r\nNichol, and justified Luerson, stealing round behind Frazer.  I called\r\nout to him at the top of my voice to warn him; but he did not seem to\r\nhear.  I looked for something which might serve me for a weapon; but\r\nthere was nothing, not so much as a broken bough within reach, and in\r\nanother instant, the whole thing was over.  As Knight grappled with\r\nLuerson, he dropped the knife which he had wrested from Atoa, his\r\nintention evidently being to secure, and not to kill him.\r\n\r\n\"Atoa immediately leaped forward and seized the knife, and had his arm\r\nalready raised to stab Mr Knight in the back, when Frazer shot him\r\ndead.  At almost the same instant, Luerson struck Mr Knight a\r\ntremendous blow on the head with his mallet, which felled him to the\r\nearth, stunned and lifeless.  He next rushed upon Frazer, who had fairly\r\ncovered him with the muzzle of his piece, and would inevitably have shot\r\nhim, but just as he pulled the trigger, the man whom I had seen creeping\r\nround behind him, sprang upon him, and deranged his aim; two or three of\r\nthe others, who had stood looking on, taking no part in the affair, now\r\ninterposed, and by their assistance Frazer was overpowered and secured.\r\nWhether they murdered him or not, as Luerson afterwards declared, I do\r\nnot know.  As soon as the struggle was over, the man who had seconded\r\nLuerson so actively throughout, (the tall dark man who goes by the name\r\nof `the Boatswain,') shouted out, `Now, then, for the ship!'  `Yes, for\r\nthe ship!' cried Luerson, `though this has not come about just as was\r\narranged, and has been hurried on sooner than we expected; it is as well\r\nso as any way, and must be followed up.  There's no one aboard but the\r\ncaptain, and four or five men and boys, all told: the landsmen are all\r\nashore, scattered over the island.  We can take her without risk--and\r\nthen for a merry life at the islands!'\r\n\r\n\"This revealed the designs of the mutineers, and I determined to\r\nanticipate them if possible.  As I started for the beach I was observed,\r\nand they hailed me; but without paying any attention to their shouts, I\r\nran as fast, at least, as I ever ran before, until I came out of the\r\nforest, near where you were standing.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the words of Luerson which Morton had heard, it was clear that the\r\nmutiny had not been a sudden and unpremeditated act; and we had no doubt\r\nthat it had grown out of the difficulties at the Kingsmills, between him\r\nand the unfortunate Mr Nichol.\r\n\r\nIt was quite late before we felt any disposition to sleep; but\r\nnotwithstanding the excitement and the discomforts of our situation, we\r\nbegan at length to experience the effects of the fatigue and anxiety\r\nwhich we had undergone, and bestowing ourselves as conveniently as\r\npossible about the boat, which furnished but slender accommodations for\r\nsuch a number, we bade each other the accustomed \"good night,\" and one\r\nby one dropped asleep.\r\n\r\nKnowing that we could not be far from land, and aware of our liability\r\nto be drifted ashore during the night, it had been decided to maintain a\r\nwatch.  Arthur, Morton, and I had agreed to divide the time between us\r\nas accurately as possible, and to relieve one another in turn.  The\r\nfirst watch fell to Arthur, the last to me, and, after exacting a\r\npromise from Morton, that he would not fail to awaken me when it was\r\nfairly my turn, I laid down upon the ceiling planks, close against the\r\nside of the boat between which, and Browne, who was next me, there was\r\nbarely room to squeeze myself.\r\n\r\nIt was a dreary night.  The air was damp, and even chilly.  The\r\nweltering of the waves upon the outside of the thin plank against which\r\nmy head was pressed, made a dismal kind of music, and suggested vividly\r\nhow frail was the only barrier that separated us from the wide, dark\r\nwaste of waters, below and around.\r\n\r\nThe heavy, dirge-like swell of the ocean, though soothing, in the\r\nregularity and monotony of its sluggish motion, sounded inexpressibly\r\nmournful.\r\n\r\nThe gloom of the night, and the tragic scenes of the day, seemed to give\r\ncharacter to my dreams, for they were dark and hideous, and so terribly\r\nvivid, that I several times awoke strangely agitated.\r\n\r\nAt one time I saw Luerson, with a countenance of supernatural malignity,\r\nand the expression of a fiend, murdering poor Frazer.  At another, our\r\nboat seemed drawn by some irresistible, but unseen power, to the verge\r\nof a yawning abyss, and began to descend between green-glancing walls of\r\nwater, to vast depths, where undescribed sea-monsters, never seen upon\r\nthe surface, glided about in an obscurity that increased their\r\nhideousness.  Suddenly the feeble light that streamed down into the gulf\r\nthrough the green translucent sea, seemed to be cut off; the liquid\r\nwalls closed above our heads; and we were whirled away, with the sound\r\nof rushing waters, and in utter darkness.\r\n\r\nAll this was vague and confused, and consisted of the usual \"stuff that\r\ndreams are made of.\"  What followed, was wonderfully vivid and real:\r\nevery thing was as distinct as a picture, and it has left an indelible\r\nimpression upon my mind; there was something about it far more awful\r\nthan all the half-defined shapes and images of terror that preceded it.\r\n\r\nI seemed to be all alone, in our little boat, in the midst of the sea.\r\nIt was night--and what a night! not a breath of wind rippled the glassy\r\nwaters.  There was no moon, but the sky was cloudless, and the stars\r\nwere out, in solemn and mysterious beauty.  Every thing seemed\r\npreternaturally still, and I felt oppressed by a strange sense of\r\nloneliness; I looked round in vain for some familiar object, the sight\r\nof which might afford me relief.  But far, far as the eye could reach,\r\nto the last verge of the horizon, where the gleaming sapphire vault\r\nclosed down upon the sea, stretched one wide, desolate, unbroken\r\nexpanse.  I seemed to be isolated and cut off from all living things:\r\n\r\n  \"Alone--alone, all, all alone!\r\n  Alone on the wide, wide sea;\r\n  So lonely 'twas, that God himself\r\n  Scarce seemed there to be.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there was something in this feeling, and in the universal,\r\ndeath-like silence, that was unutterably awful.  I tried to pray--to\r\nthink of God as present even there--to think of Him as \"Our Father\"--as\r\ncaring for and loving his creatures--and thus to escape the desolating\r\nsense of loneliness that oppressed me.  But it was in vain; I could not\r\npray: there was something in the scene that mocked at faith, and seemed\r\nin harmony with the dreary creed of the atheist.  The horrible idea of a\r\ngodless universe came upon me, bidding me relinquish, as a fond\r\nillusion, the belief in a Heavenly Father,--\r\n\r\n  \"Who sees with equal eye, as Lord of all,\r\n  A hero perish, or a sparrow fall.\"\r\n\r\nLanguage cannot express the desolation of that thought.\r\n\r\nThen the scene changed once more.  We were again on board the ship, and\r\nin the power of the enraged mutineers, about to suffer whatever their\r\nvengeance might impel them to inflict.  Poor Spot was swinging, a livid\r\ncorpse, at one of the yard-arms.  Browne was bound to the main-mast,\r\nwhile Luerson and his fiendish crew were exhausting their ingenuity in\r\ntorturing him.  The peculiar expression of his mild, open countenance,\r\ndistorted by pain, went to my heart, and the sound of that familiar and\r\nfriendly voice, now hoarse and broken, and quivering with agony,\r\nthrilled me with horror.  As he besought his tormentors to kill him at\r\nonce, I thought that I kneeled to Luerson, and seconded the entreaty--\r\nthe greatest favour that could be hoped from him.  The rest of us were\r\ndoomed to walk the plank.  Morton was stern and silent; Max pale and\r\nsorrowful; his arm was round my neck, and he murmured that life was\r\nsweet, and that it was a hard and terrible thing to die--to die so!\r\nArthur, calm and collected, cheered and encouraged us; and his face\r\nseemed like the face of an angel, as he spoke sweetly and solemnly, of\r\nthe goodness and the love of God, and bade us put our whole trust and\r\nhope in Christ our Saviour.  His earnest words and serene look, soothed\r\nand strengthened us; we also became calm and almost resigned.  There was\r\nno abject fear, no useless cries, or supplications to our foes for\r\nmercy; but the solemn sense of the awfulness of death, was mingled with\r\na sweet and sustaining faith in God, and Christ, and Immortality.  Hand\r\nin hand, like brothers, we were preparing to take the fearful plunge--\r\nwhen I started and awoke.\r\n\r\nEven the recollection of our real situation was insufficient to impair\r\nthe deep sense of relief which I experienced.  My first impulse was to\r\nthank God that these were but dreams; and if I had obeyed the next, I\r\nshould have embraced heartily each of my slumbering companions; for in\r\nthe first confusion of thought and feeling, my emotions were very much\r\nwhat they would naturally have been, had the scenes of visionary terror,\r\nin which we seemed to have just participated together, been real.\r\n\r\nMorton was at his post, and I spoke to him, scarcely knowing or caring\r\nwhat I said.  All I wanted, was to hear his voice, to revive the sense\r\nof companionship, and so escape the painful impressions which even yet\r\nclung to me.\r\n\r\nHe said that he had just commenced his watch, Arthur having called him\r\nbut a few moments before.  The night was still lowering and overcast,\r\nbut there was less wind and sea than when I first laid down.  I proposed\r\nto relieve him at once, but he felt no greater inclination to sleep than\r\nmyself and we watched together until morning.  The two or three hours\r\nimmediately before dawn seemed terribly long.  Just as the first grey\r\nlight appeared in the east, Arthur joined us.  A dense volume of vapour\r\nwhich rested upon the water, and contributed to the obscurity in which\r\nwe were enveloped, now gathered slowly into masses, and floated upward\r\nas the day advanced, gradually clearing the prospect; and we kept\r\nlooking out for the island, in the momentary expectation of seeing it\r\nloom up before us through the mist.  But when, as the light increased,\r\nand the fog rolled away, the boundaries of our vision rapidly enlarged,\r\nand still no land could be seen, we began to feel seriously alarmed.  A\r\nshort period of intense and painful anxiety followed, during which we\r\ncontinued alternately gazing, and waiting for more light, and again\r\nstraining our aching eyes in every direction, and still in vain.\r\n\r\nAt last it became evident that we had in some manner drifted completely\r\naway from the island.  The appalling conviction could no longer be\r\nresisted.  There we were, lost and helpless, on the open ocean, in our\r\nchip of a boat, without provisions for a single day, or, to speak more\r\ndefinitely, without a morsel of bread or a drop of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSULTATION.\r\n\r\nOUT OF SIGHT OF LAND--SLENDER RESOURCES--WHAT'S TO BE DONE?\r\n\r\n    \"How rapidly, how rapidly, we ride along the sea!\r\n  The morning is all sunshine, the wind is blowing free;\r\n  The billows are all sparkling, and bounding in the light,\r\n  Like creatures in whose sunny veins, the blood is running bright.\"\r\n\r\nMorton alone still refused to relinquish the hope, that by broad\r\ndaylight, we should yet be able to make out the island.  He persisted in\r\npronouncing it wholly incredible that we had made during the night, a\r\ndistance sufficient to sink the land, which was but three or four miles\r\noff at the utmost, when we were overtaken by darkness; he could not\r\nunderstand, he said, how such a thing was possible.\r\n\r\nArthur accounted for it, by supposing that we had got into the track of\r\none of the ocean currents that exist in those seas, especially among the\r\nislands, many of which run at the rate of from two to three miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThis seemed the more probable, from the fact, that we were to the west\r\nof the island, when we lost sight of it, and that the great equatorial\r\ncurrent, which traverses the Pacific and Indian oceans, has a prevailing\r\nwesterly course, though among the more extensive groups and clusters of\r\nislands, it is so often deflected hither and thither, by the obstacles\r\nwhich it encounters, or turned upon itself, in eddies or\r\ncounter-currents, that no certain calculations can be made respecting\r\nit.  Morton, however, did not consider this supposition sufficient to\r\nexplain the difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"I should judge,\" said he, \"that in a clear day, such an island might be\r\nseen fifteen or twenty miles, and we cannot have drifted so great a\r\ndistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might perhaps be seen,\" said Arthur, \"as far as that, from the\r\nmast-head of a ship, or even from her deck, but not from a small boat\r\nhardly raised above the surface of the water.  At our present level,\r\neight or ten miles would be enough to sink it completely.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, when it was broad day, and from the appearance of the eastern\r\nsky, the sun was just about to rise, Morton stepped the mast and climbed\r\nto the top, in the hope that from that additional elevation, slight as\r\nit was, he might catch a glimpse of land.  There was by this time light\r\nenough, as he admitted, to see any thing that could be seen at all, and\r\nafter making a deliberate survey of our whole horizon, he was fully\r\nconvinced that we had drifted completely away from the island.  \"I give\r\nit up,\" he said, as he slid down the mast, \"we are at sea, beyond all\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nPresently Max awoke.  He cast a quick, surprised look around, and at\r\nfirst seemed greatly shocked.  He speedily recovered himself, however,\r\nand after another, and closer, scrutiny of the horizon, thought that he\r\ndetected an appearance like that of land in the south.  For a moment\r\nthere was again the flutter of excited hope, as every eye was turned\r\neagerly in that direction; but it soon subsided.  A brief examination\r\nsatisfied us all, that what we saw, was but a low bank of clouds lying\r\nagainst the sky.\r\n\r\n\"This really begins to look serious,\" said I; \"what are we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"It strikes me,\" replied Morton, \"that we are pretty much relieved from\r\nthe necessity of considering that question; our only part for the\r\npresent seems to be a passive one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't fully persuade myself that this is real,\" said Max; \"it half\r\nseems like an ugly dream, from which we should awake by-and-by, and draw\r\na long breath at the relief of finding it no more than a dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are miserably provisioned for a sea voyage,\" said Morton; \"but I\r\nbelieve the breaker is half full of water; without that we should indeed\r\nbe badly off.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is not a drop in it,\" said Arthur, shaking his head, and he\r\nlifted the breaker and shook it lightly--it was quite empty.\r\n\r\nHe now proceeded to force open the locker, in the hope of finding them\r\nsomething that might be serviceable to us; but its entire contents\r\nconsisted of a coil of fine rope, some pieces of rope-yarn, an empty\r\nquart-bottle, and an old and battered hatchet-head.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Browne, without a trace of anxiety upon his upturned\r\ncountenance, and Johnny, who nestled close beside him, continued to\r\nsleep soundly, in happy unconsciousness of our alarming situation.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing ever interferes with the soundness of Browne's sleep, or the\r\nvigour of his appetite,\" said Max, contemplating his placid slumbers\r\nwith admiration.  \"I should be puzzled to decide whether sleeping,\r\neating, or dramatic recitation, is his forte; it certainly lies between\r\nthe three.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow!\" said Morton, \"from present appearances, and the state of\r\nour supplies, he will have to take it all out in sleeping, for some time\r\nto come, as it is to be presumed he'll hardly feel like spouting.\"\r\n\r\n\"One would think that what happened yesterday, and the condition of\r\nthings as we left them last night, would be enough to disturb one's\r\nnerves somewhat; yet you see how little it affects him--and I now\r\npredict that the first thing he will say on opening his eye; will be\r\nabout the means of breaking his long fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand how you can go on in that strain, Max,\" said Arthur,\r\nlooking up in a surprised manner, and shaking his head disapprovingly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I was merely endeavouring to do my share towards keeping our\r\nspirits up; but I suppose any spirits got up under the present\r\ncircumstances, must be somewhat forced, and as my motives don't seem to\r\nbe properly appreciated, I will renounce the unprofitable attempt.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun rose in a clear sky, and gave promise of a hot day.  There was,\r\nhowever, a cool and refreshing breeze, that scattered the spray from the\r\nfoaming ridges of the waves, and occasionally showered us, not\r\nunpleasantly, with the fine liquid particles.  A sea, breaking over our\r\nbow, dashed a bucket-full of water into Browne's face, and abruptly\r\ndisturbed his slumbers.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, comrades!\" said he, sitting up, and looking about him\r\nwith a perplexed and bewildered air.  \"But how is this?  Ah!  I\r\nrecollect it all now.  So then, we are really out of sight of land!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no longer any doubt of that,\" said Arthur, \"and it is now time\r\nfor us to decide what we shall do--our chance of falling in with a ship\r\nwill be quite as good, and that of reaching land will of course be much\r\nbetter, if, instead of drifting like a log upon the water, we put up our\r\nsail, and steer in almost any direction; though I think there is a\r\nchoice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course there is a choice,\" said Morton; \"the island _cannot_ be at\r\nany great distance; and the probability of our being able to find it\r\nagain is so much greater than that of making any other land, that we\r\nought to steer in the direction in which we have good reason to think it\r\nlies--that is, to the east.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wind, for the last twelve hours, has been pretty nearly south,\"\r\nobserved Arthur, \"and has probably had some effect upon our position; we\r\nhad better, therefore, steer a little south of east, which, with this\r\nbreeze, will be easy sailing.\"\r\n\r\nTo this all assented, and the sail was hoisted, and the boat's head put\r\nin the direction agreed upon, each of us, except Johnny, sailing and\r\nsteering her in turn.  There was quite as much wind as our little craft\r\ncould sail with to advantage, and without danger.  As it filled her bit\r\nof canvass, she careered before it, leaping and plunging from wave to\r\nwave, in a manner that sometimes seemed perilous.  The bright sky above\r\nus, the blue sea gleaming in the light of morning, over which we sped;\r\nthe dry, clear atmosphere, (now that the sun was up, and the mist\r\ndissipated), the fresh breeze, without which we must have suffered\r\nintensely from the heat; together with our rapid and bounding motion,\r\nhad an exhilarating effect, in spite of the gloomy anticipations that\r\nsuggested themselves.\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" said Max, \"why need we take such a dismal view of the\r\nmatter?  We have a fine staunch little boat, a good breeze, and islands\r\nall around us.  Besides, we are in the very track of the beche de mer,\r\nand sandal-wood traders.  It would be strange indeed, if we should fail\r\nto meet some of them soon.  In fact, if it were not for thinking of poor\r\nFrazer, and of the horrible events of yesterday, (which, to be sure, are\r\nenough to make one sad), I should be disposed to look upon the whole\r\naffair; as a sort of holiday adventure--something to tell of when we get\r\nhome, and to talk over pleasantly together twenty years hence.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we had a breaker of water, and a keg of biscuit,\" said Morton, \"and\r\ncould then be assured of fair weather for a week, I might be able to\r\ntake that view of it; as it is, I confess, that to me, it has any thing\r\nbut the aspect of a holiday adventure.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Johnny awoke, Arthur endeavoured to soothe his alarm, by explaining\r\nto him that we had strong hopes of being able to reach the island again,\r\nand mentioning the various circumstances which rendered such a hope\r\nreasonable.  The little fellow, did not, however, seem to be as much\r\ntroubled as might have been expected.  He either reposed implicit\r\nconfidence in the resources, or the fortunes, of his companions, or\r\nelse, did not at all realise the perils to which we were exposed.  But\r\nthis could not last long.\r\n\r\nThat which I knew Arthur had been painfully anticipating, came at last.\r\nJohnny, who had been asking Morton a multitude of questions as to the\r\nevents of the previous day, suddenly said that he was very thirsty, and\r\nasked in the most unsuspecting manner for a drink of water.  When he\r\nlearned that the breaker was empty, and that we had not so much as a\r\ndrop of water with us, some notion of our actual situation seemed to\r\ndawn upon him, and he became, all at once, grave and silent.\r\n\r\nHour after hour dragged slowly on, until the sun was in the zenith, with\r\nno change for the better in our affairs.  It was now clear that we must\r\ngive up the hope of reaching the island which we had left, for it was\r\ncertain that we had sailed farther since morning than the boat could\r\npossibly have been drifted during the night, by the wind, or the\r\ncurrent, or both combined.  Our calculations at the outset must\r\ntherefore have been erroneous, and we had not been sailing in the right\r\ndirection.  If so, it was too late to correct the mistake; we could not\r\nregain our starting-point, in order to steer from it another course.  We\r\nnow held a second consultation.\r\n\r\nAlthough we had but a general notion of our geographical position, we\r\nknew that we were in the neighbourhood of scattered groups of low coral\r\nislands.  From the Kingsmills we were to have sailed directly for\r\nCanton, and Max, Morton, and myself, would, before now, in all\r\nprobability, have commenced our employment in the American factory\r\nthere, but for Captain Erskine's sudden resolution to take the\r\nresponsibility of returning to the Samoan Group, with the double object\r\nof rescuing the crew of the wrecked barque, and completing his cargo,\r\nwhich, according to the information received from the master of the\r\nwhaler, there would be no difficulty in doing.  From Upolu, we had\r\nsteered a north-westerly course, and it was on the fourth or fifth day\r\nafter leaving it, that we had reached the island where the mutiny took\r\nplace, and which Mr Erskine claimed as a discovery of his own.  Its\r\nlatitude and longitude had of course been calculated, but none of us\r\nlearned the result, or at any rate remembered it.  We knew only, that we\r\nwere at no great distance from the Kingsmills, and probably to the\r\nsouth-west of them.\r\n\r\nArthur was confident, from conversations had with Mr Frazer, and from\r\nthe impressions left on his mind by his last examination of the charts,\r\nthat an extensive cluster of low islands, scattered over several degrees\r\nof latitude, lay just to the south-east of us.\r\n\r\nIt was accordingly determined to continue our present course as long as\r\nthe wind should permit, which there was reason to fear might be but a\r\nshort time, as easterly winds are the prevailing ones within the\r\ntropics, as near the line as we supposed ourselves to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CALM.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND WATCH--AN EVIL OMEN--THE WHITE SHARK--A BREAKFAST LOST.\r\n\r\n  \"All in a hot and copper sky,\r\n  The bloody sun, at noon,\r\n  Right up above the mast did stand,\r\n  No bigger than the moon.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the day the wind continued fair, and we held on\r\nour course, steering by the sun, and keeping a vigilant look-out in\r\nevery direction.  But the night set in, and we had yet seen no\r\nappearance of land, no speck in the distance which could be mistaken for\r\na sail, not even a wandering sea-bird or a school of flying-fish--\r\nnothing to break the dead monotony of the briny waste we were\r\ntraversing.  As I sat at the helm, taking my turn in sailing the boat,\r\nand watched the sun go down, and saw the darkness gathering over the\r\nsea, a feeling nearly akin to despair took possession of me.  In vain I\r\nstrove to take an encouraging and hopeful view of our circumstances.\r\nThe time within which relief must come, in order to be effectual, was so\r\nshort, that I could not help feeling that the probabilities were\r\nstrongly against us.  I could not shut my eyes to the fact, that\r\ndangers, imminent and real, such as we had read and talked of, without\r\never half realising or dreaming that they could one day fall to our own\r\nlot, now pressed upon us, and threatened us close at hand.  I knew that\r\nthose fearful tales of shipwreck and starvation, were only too true--\r\nthat men, lost at sea like ourselves, had pined day after day, without a\r\nmorsel of food or a drop of water, until they had escaped, in stupor or\r\ndelirium, all consciousness of suffering.  And worse even than this--too\r\nhorrible to be thought or spoken of--I knew something of the dreadful\r\nand disgusting expedients to prolong life, which have sometimes been\r\nresorted to by famishing wretches.  I had read how the pangs of hunger,\r\nand the still fiercer torments of thirst, had seemed to work a dire\r\nchange even in kind and generous natures, making men wolfish, so that\r\nthey slew and fed upon each other.  Now, all that was most revolting and\r\ninhuman, in what I had heard or read of such things, rose vividly before\r\nme, and I shuddered at the growing probability that experiences like\r\nthese might be reserved for us.  \"Why not for us,\" I thought, \"as well\r\nas for the many others, the records of whose terrible fate I have\r\nperused with scarcely more emotion than would be excited by a tale of\r\nimaginary suffering; and the still greater number whose story has never\r\nbeen recorded?  We have already been conducted many steps on this\r\nfearful path, and no laws of nature will be stayed, no ordinary rules of\r\nGod's dealing violated, on our behalf.  No inevitable necessity requires\r\nthe complexion of our future, to correspond and harmonise with that of\r\nour past lives.  This feeling, which seems to assure me that such things\r\ncannot happen to us, is but one of the cheats and illusions of a\r\nshrinking and self-pitying spirit.  All the memories that cluster about\r\na happy childhood, all the sweet associations of home and kindred,\r\nafford no guarantee against the new and bitter experiences which seem\r\nabout to open up upon us.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the thoughts that began to disquiet my own mind.  As to my\r\ncompanions, Morton seemed less anxious and excited than any of the\r\nothers.  During the evening he speculated in a cool matter-of-fact\r\nmanner, upon our chances of reaching an island, or meeting a ship,\r\nbefore being reduced to the last extremity.  He spoke of the number of\r\ntraders that frequent the islands, for tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl,\r\nsandal-wood, beche de mer, etcetera; the whalers that come in pursuit of\r\nthe cachelot, or sperm-whale; the vessels that resort there for fruit,\r\nor supplies of wood and water; the vast number of islands scattered\r\nthrough these seas; from all which he finally concluded, that the\r\nchances were largely in our favour.  If, however, we should fail of\r\nimmediate relief in this shape, he thought it probable that we should\r\nhave opportunities of catching fish, or sea-birds, and so prolonging\r\nlife for many days.  He talked the whole matter over in such a calm,\r\nsober, unexcited manner, furnishing facts and reasons for every opinion,\r\nthat I felt some confidence in his conclusions.\r\n\r\nBrowne, though quite composed and self-possessed, had, from the moment\r\nwhen he discovered that we were out of sight of land, taken the most\r\nserious view of our situation.  He seemed to have made up his mind for\r\nthe worst, and was abstracted, and indisposed to converse.  I knew that\r\nthe anxiety which Arthur evinced, was not mainly on his own account.  It\r\ndid not withdraw his attention from what was passing, or diminish his\r\ninterest in it.  Far from being gloomy or abstracted, he was active and\r\nwatchful, and spoke with heartiness and cheerfulness.  His mental\r\ndisquietude only appeared, in a certain softness and tremor of his\r\nvoice, especially when speaking to Johnny, who, as the night drew on,\r\nasked him over and over again, at short intervals, \"Don't you think,\r\nArthur, that we shall certainly find land to-morrow?\"  This was truly\r\ndistressing.\r\n\r\nAs to Max, his feelings rose and fell capriciously, and without any\r\napparent cause; he was sanguine or depressed, not from a consideration\r\nof all our circumstances, and a favourable or unfavourable conclusion\r\ndrawn therefrom; but according as this view or that, for the moment,\r\nimpressed his mind.  He rendered no reasons for his hopes or his fears.\r\nAt one moment, you would judge from his manner and conversation that we\r\nwere indeed out upon some \"holy day excursion,\" with no serious danger\r\nimpending over us; the next, without any thing to account for the\r\nchange, he would appear miserably depressed and wretched.\r\n\r\nSoon after sunset the moon rose--pale and dim at first, but shining out\r\nwith a clearer and brighter radiance, as the darkness increased.  The\r\nwind held steadily from the same quarter, and it was determined to\r\ncontinue through the night, the arrangement for taking charge of the\r\nsailing of the boat, in turn.  Browne and Max insisted on sharing\r\nbetween themselves the watch for the entire night, saying that they had\r\ntaken no part in that of the one previous, and that it would be useless\r\nto divide the twelve hours of darkness into more than two watches.  This\r\nwas finally agreed upon, the wind being so moderate that the same person\r\ncould steer the yawl and manage the sail without difficulty.\r\n\r\nBefore lying down, I requested Max, who took the first turn, to awake me\r\nat the same time with Browne, a part of whose watch I intended to share.\r\nI fell asleep, looking up at the moon, and the light clouds sailing\r\nacross the sky, and listening to the motion of the water beneath the\r\nboat.  At first I slumbered lightly, without losing a sort of dreamy\r\nconsciousness, so that I heard Max humming over to himself fragments of\r\ntunes, and odd verses of old songs, and even knew when he shifted his\r\nposition in the stern, from one side to the other.  At length I must\r\nhave fallen into a deep sleep: I do not know how long it had lasted, (it\r\nseemed to me but a short time), when I was aroused by an exclamation,\r\nfrom Max, as I at first supposed; but on sitting up I saw that Browne\r\nwas at the helm, while Max was sleeping at my side.  On perceiving that\r\nI was awake, Browne, from whom the exclamation had proceeded, pointed to\r\nsomething in the water, just astern.  Following the direction of his\r\nfinger with my eye, I saw, just beneath the surface, a large\r\nghastly-looking white shark, gliding stealthily along, and apparently\r\nfollowing the boat.  Browne said that he had first noticed it about half\r\nan hour before, since which time it had steadily followed us,\r\noccasionally making a leisurely circuit round the boat, and then\r\ndropping astern again.  A moment ago, having fallen into a doze at the\r\nhelm, and awaking with a start, he found himself leaning over the\r\ngunwale, and the shark just at his elbow.  This had startled him, and\r\ncaused the sudden exclamation by which I had been aroused.  I shuddered\r\nat his narrow escape, and I acknowledge that the sight of this hideous\r\nand formidable creature, stealing along in our wake, and manifesting an\r\nintention to keep us company, caused me some uneasy sensations.  He swam\r\nwith his dorsal fin almost at the surface, and his broad nose scarcely\r\nthree feet from the rudder.  His colour rendered him distinctly visible.\r\n\r\n\"What a spectre of a fish it is,\" said Browne, \"with his pallid,\r\ncorpse-like skin, and noiseless motion; he has no resemblance to any of\r\nthe rest of his kind, that I have ever seen.  You know what the sailors\r\nwould say, if they should see him dogging us in this way; Old\r\nCrosstrees, or Spot, would shake their heads ominously, and set us down\r\nas a doomed company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aside from any such superstitious notions, he is an unpleasant and\r\ndangerous neighbour, and we must be circumspect while he is prowling\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly won't do to doze at the helm,\" resumed Browne; \"I consider\r\nthat I have just now had a really narrow escape.  I was leaning quite\r\nover the gunwale; a lurch of the boat would have thrown me overboard,\r\nand then there would have been no chance for me.\"\r\n\r\nThere would not, in fact, have been the shadow of a chance.\r\n\r\n\"Even as it was,\" resumed he, \"if this hideous-looking monster had been\r\nas active and vigilant as some of his tribe, it would have fared badly\r\nwith me.  I have heard of their seizing persons standing on the shore,\r\nwhere the water was deep enough to let them swim close in; and Spot\r\ntells of a messmate of his, on one of his voyages in a whaler, who was\r\ncarried off, while standing entirely out of water, on the carcass of a\r\nwhale, which he was assisting in cutting up, as it lay alongside the\r\nship.  The shark threw himself upon the carcass, five or six yards from\r\nwhere the man was busy;--worked himself slowly along the slippery\r\nsurface, until within reach of his victim; knocked him off into the\r\nwater, and then sliding off himself, seized and devoured him.\"\r\n\r\nPicking my way carefully among the sleepers, who covered the bottom of\r\nthe yawl, I sat down beside Browne in the stern, intending to share the\r\nremainder of his watch.  It was now long past midnight; fragments of\r\nlight clouds were scattered over the sky, frequently obscuring the moon;\r\nand the few stars that were visible, twinkled faintly with a cold and\r\ndistant light.  The Southern Cross, by far the most brilliant\r\nconstellation of that hemisphere, was conspicuous among the clusters of\r\nfeebler luminaries.  Well has it been called \"the glory of the southern\r\nskies.\"  Near the zenith, and second only to the Cross in brilliancy,\r\nappeared the Northern Crown, consisting of seven large stars, so\r\ndisposed as to form the outline of two-thirds of an oval.  Of the\r\nfamiliar constellations of the northern hemisphere, scarcely one was\r\nvisible, except Orion, and the Pleiades.\r\n\r\nAt length the moon descended behind a bank of silvery clouds, piled up\r\nalong the horizon.  The partial obscurity that ensued, only added to the\r\ngrandeur of the midnight scene, as we sat gazing silently abroad upon\r\nthe confused mass of swelling waters, stretching away into the gloom.\r\nBut if the scene was grand, it was also desolate; we two were perhaps\r\nthe only human beings, for many hundreds of miles, who looked forth upon\r\nit.  Our companions were wrapped in unconsciousness, and their deep and\r\nregular breathing attested the soundness of their slumbers.  As the\r\nlight failed more and more, and the shadows deepened, the sea began to\r\nassume a beautiful and striking appearance, gleaming in places with a\r\nbluish lambent light, and exhibiting, where the water was most agitated,\r\nlarge luminous patches.  Thin waves of flame curled over our bow, and\r\nwhenever a sea broke upon it, it seemed as though the boat was plunging\r\nthrough surges of fire.  A long brilliant line, thickly strewn on each\r\nside, with little globules of the colour of burning coals, marked our\r\nwake.\r\n\r\nBut the shark, which still followed close behind our keel, presented by\r\nfar the most singular and striking spectacle.  He seemed to be\r\nsurrounded by a luminous medium; and his nose, his dorsal and side fins,\r\nand his tail, each had attached to them slender jets of phosphoric fire.\r\nTowards morning this brilliant appearance began to fade, and soon\r\nvanished altogether.  By this time I found it difficult to keep my eyes\r\nopen longer, and leaving Browne to finish his watch alone, I resumed my\r\nplace on the ceiling planks, and in spite of the hardness of my bed,\r\nwhich caused every bone in my body to ache, soon slept soundly.  When I\r\nagain awoke, it was long after sunrise, and we were lying completely\r\nbecalmed.  A school of large fish were pursuing their gambols at a short\r\ndistance, and Browne was rowing cautiously toward them, while Arthur and\r\nMorton stood prepared to attack them with their cutlasses as soon as we\r\nshould get within striking distance.  We had got almost among them, and\r\nwere just beginning to congratulate ourselves upon their apparent\r\nindifference to our approach, when they all at once scattered in every\r\ndirection, with manifest signs of terror.  The cause of this sudden\r\nmovement was not long concealed; a brace of sharks rose in their very\r\nmidst; one was visible but for a moment as he rolled over to seize his\r\nprey; the other, less successful in securing a victim, shot past us,\r\nlike an arrow, in pursuit of a large division of the fugitives.  Soon\r\nafter, both of them were seen playing around the boat.  They belonged to\r\nthe species known as the tiger shark, and bore no resemblance to our\r\nghastly visitor of the preceding evening.  By the consternation which\r\ntheir sudden appearance had produced among the lesser fishes, they had\r\nin all probability robbed us of our breakfast.  Morton, with his\r\ncharacteristic enterprise, suggested an attack upon one of them by way\r\nof reprisals; but before any measures for that purpose could be taken,\r\nthey disappeared, leaving us with no other resource than to await our\r\nfate with such patience and resignation as we could command.  The wind\r\nhaving entirely failed, there was nothing that we could do to change our\r\nsituation--absolutely nothing.  This forced inaction, with no occupation\r\nfor mind or body, no object of effort, contributed to enhance whatever\r\nwas painful in our condition, by leaving us to brood over it.  The dead\r\ncalm which had fallen upon the sea, seemed all that was necessary to\r\ncomplete our misery.  We were all stiff and sore, from the exceedingly\r\nuncomfortable sleeping accommodations of the last two nights; but this\r\nwas a comparatively trifling evil.  Johnny had a severe cold, his eyes\r\nwere inflamed and bloodshot, and he exhibited also strong symptoms of\r\nfever.  Nevertheless, silent and uncomplaining, he came and sat down\r\nquietly by the side of Arthur in the stern.\r\n\r\nAs the day advanced, the heat became dreadful.  We had not suffered much\r\nfrom it the day before, on account of the fresh breeze which had\r\nprevailed; but now, not a breath of air was stirring, and the glassy sea\r\nreflected back upon us the scorching rays of the sun, with increased\r\nintensity.  Towards noon, it exceeded any thing I had ever experienced.\r\nThe whole arch of the heavens glowed with a hot and coppery glare.  It\r\nseemed as though instead of one sun, there were ten thousand, covering\r\nall the sky, and blending their rays into a broad canopy of fire.  The\r\nair was like that of an oven: the water had no coolness, no refreshing\r\nquality; it was tepid and stagnant: no living thing was to be seen near\r\nthe surface, for life could not be sustained there; and the fishes,\r\ngreat and small, kept themselves in the cooler depths, far below.\r\nAlmost stifled by the heat, we began to experience the first real and\r\nextreme suffering that most of us had ever known.  At Arthur's\r\nsuggestion, we disengaged the now useless sail from the mast, and\r\ncontrived a kind of awning, by fastening two of the oars upright in the\r\nboat, with the mast extending between them, throwing the sail over the\r\nlatter, and securing the ends to the gunwales.  This, although it could\r\nnot protect us from the sultry and suffocating air, warded off the\r\nblistering beams of the sun, and during the greater part of the day, we\r\nlay crouched beneath it, a miserable company; one or another of us\r\ncrawling out occasionally, to take a survey.  Towards the close of the\r\nafternoon, my sufferings from thirst grew absolutely intolerable, and\r\namounted to torment.  My blood became fevered; my brain seemed on fire;\r\nmy shrunk and shrivelled tongue, was like a dry stick in my mouth.  The\r\ncountenances of my companions, their bloodshot eyes, and cracked and\r\nswollen lips, shewed what they were undergoing.  Johnny lay in the\r\nbottom of the boat with his eyes shut enduring all, with as much\r\nfortitude as the rest of us, except that now and then a half suppressed\r\nmoan escaped him.\r\n\r\nIt was quite clear that relief, in order to be of any avail, must be\r\nspeedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nA CHANGE.\r\n\r\nA WELCOME PERIL--THE ALBATROSS AND THEIR PREY--A TROPICAL THUNDER-STORM.\r\n\r\n  \"Eternal Providence, exceeding thought,\r\n  Where none appears, can make itself a way.\"\r\n\r\nWhile lying crouched under the sail, almost gasping for breath, near the\r\nmiddle, as I suppose, of that terrible afternoon, I all at once became\r\nsensible of a perceptible cooling of the atmosphere, and a sudden\r\ndecrease of light.  Looking out to discover the cause of this change, I\r\nperceived that the sky was overcast, and that a light, unsteady breeze\r\nfrom the north-west had sprung up.  Knowing that within the tropics, and\r\nnear the line, winds from that quarter frequently precede a storm, and\r\nthat great extremes of heat are often succeeded by violent gales, I\r\nobserved, with apprehension, dark masses of clouds gathering in the\r\nnorth.  It would not require a tempest to insure our destruction; for\r\nour little craft could not live a moment, even in such a gale as would\r\nbe attended by no danger to a staunch ship with plenty of sea room.\r\n\r\nThe temperature had fallen many degrees, though the wind was still\r\nmoderate and unsteady, ranging from west to north-east.  The sun was\r\ncompletely obscured, so that the awning was no longer needed, and we\r\npulled it down, in order the more fully to enjoy the breeze, and the\r\ndelicious coolness of the darkened atmosphere, to the gratefulness of\r\nwhich, not even our awakening apprehensions could render us insensible.\r\n\r\nWhile observing the strange appearance of the sky, and like preparations\r\nfor a storm which seemed to be going on in the north and west, Morton\r\nespied a troop of Flying-fish a hundred yards or so to windward.\r\nFluttering feebly a short distance in the air, they would drop into the\r\nsea, soon emerging, however, for a fresh flight; thus, alternately\r\nswimming and flying, they were steadily approaching; and from their\r\nrapid and confused motions, it was evident that they were hard pressed\r\nby some of the numerous and greedy persecutors of their helpless race;\r\nfrom whom they were struggling to escape.  Presently, a glittering\r\nAlbatross shot from the water, close in the tract of the fugitives,\r\ndescending again in the graceful curve peculiar to his active and\r\nbeautiful, but rapacious tribe.  Another and another followed, their\r\ngolden scales flashing in the light, as they leaped clear of the water,\r\nsometimes two or three together.  We hastily made ready to attack both\r\npursuers and pursued, the instant they should come within reach.  The\r\ncourse of the chase brought them directly towards us, until the hunted\r\nfishes fell in a glittering shower, so near, that I feared they might\r\npass under the boat before rising again; but they came to the surface\r\nclose beside us, and as they fluttered into the air, we knocked down six\r\nor seven of them, and caught a number more, that dropped into the boat.\r\nMorton and Max, ambitious of larger game, devoted their attention to the\r\nAlbatross, and slashed and thrust furiously, at such as came within\r\nreach of their cutlasses; which many of them did.  Some darted under the\r\nboat, instead of sheering round it; and one enormous fellow,\r\nmiscalculating in his haste our draught of water, must have scraped all\r\nthe fins off his back against the keel, as he performed this manoeuvre;\r\nfor the shock of the contact, caused the yawl to tremble from stem to\r\nstern.  But such was the marvellous celerity of their movements, that\r\nthough they came within easy striking distance, all the hostile\r\ndemonstrations of Max and Morton proved futile.\r\n\r\nThe Flying-fish which had been taken, were divided and apportioned with\r\nscrupulous exactness, and devoured with very little ceremony.  The only\r\ndressing or preparation bestowed upon them, consisted simply in\r\nstripping off the long shining pectoral fins, or wings, (they serve as\r\nboth), without paying much attention to such trifling matters as scales,\r\nbones, and the lesser fins.  Max, indeed, began to nibble rather\r\nfastidiously at first, at this raw food, which a minute before had been\r\nso full of life and activity; but his appetite improved as he proceeded,\r\nand he at last so far got the better of his scruples, as to leave\r\nnothing of his share except the tails, and very little even of those.\r\nHunger, in fact, made this repast, which would have been revolting under\r\nordinary circumstances, not only acceptable, but positively delicious.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the dark mass of clouds in the north had extended itself, and\r\ndrawn nearer to us.  Another tempest seemed to be gathering in the west,\r\nwhile in the south, a violent thunder-storm appeared to be actually\r\nraging: the lightning in that quarter was vivid and almost incessant,\r\nbut we could hear no thunder, the storm being still at a considerable\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nImmediately around us all was yet comparatively calm, but the heavy\r\nclouds, gathering on three sides, seemed gradually converging towards a\r\ncommon centre; a short abrupt cross sea, began to form, and the water\r\nassumed a glistening inky hue.  There was something peculiar and\r\nstriking in the appearance of the clouds surrounding us; they seemed to\r\nrest upon the surface of the ocean, and towered upward like a dark wall\r\nto the skies.  Their upper extremities were torn and irregular, and long\r\nnarrow fragments, like giant arms, streamed out from the main body, and\r\nextended over us, as if beckoning each other to a nearer approach, and\r\nthreatening to unite their gloomy array overhead, and shut out the light\r\nof day.  As they drew nearer to one another, the lightning began to dart\r\nfrom cloud to cloud, while the most terrific peals of thunder that I\r\nhave ever heard, rolled and reverberated on every side.  We appeared to\r\nbe surrounded by storms, some of which were very near, for the deep\r\ncrash of the thunder, followed close upon the vivid lightnings that\r\nflashed in the south and west.  Still the narrow space of sky directly\r\noverhead was clear, and the war of elements which was raging all around\r\ndid not extend to our immediate neighbourhood.  Against the dark sides\r\nof the cloudy pavilion that encompassed us, the sharp, zigzag lines of\r\nlightning, as they ran from the sky to the ocean, shone out with a\r\nblinding glare.  A single half-hour had sufficed to change every thing\r\nabout us.  The brazen, burning sky, was transformed into a cold, clear\r\nexpanse, of a bluish black.  The sea, no longer stagnant and glassy, was\r\nfretted by short inky waves, with creamy crests, that gave it altogether\r\na new aspect.  The air was now fresh and cool, and the wind rising and\r\nfalling fitfully, at one moment scarcely lifted our hair or stirred our\r\ngarments, and the next, tore off the entire crests of waves, and\r\nscattered them over us in a shower of spray.  For nearly an hour we\r\nremained apprehensive that the wind might increase to a gale.  At the\r\nend of about that time, it came gradually round to the south-east,\r\ngrowing steady, but by no means violent, and the storms moved off in a\r\nwesterly direction.  One heavy cloud, as it slowly passed over toward\r\nthat quarter, discharged a grateful shower of rain.  We hastily spread\r\nthe sail, and some of our garments, to gather the precious drops.  The\r\nshower lasted only a few minutes, but during that time it rained\r\nbriskly.  I never shall forget my sensations as I stood with face\r\nupturned, while the big drops, more delicious than ambrosia, came\r\npelting down.  It was far better and more strengthening than food, or\r\nany medicine or cordial could have been, and seemed to infuse fresh life\r\ninto us all.  When it was over, we wrung out from the saturated canvass,\r\nand from our clothing, water enough to mitigate for the time, though by\r\nno means to satisfy, the raging thirst from which we had suffered so\r\nintensely.\r\n\r\nArthur had at first taken out of the locker the large bottle which had\r\nbeen found there, in the hope of being able to hoard up a small supply\r\nfor the future; but there was not a drop of surplus for such a purpose,\r\nand he was obliged to put it back again empty as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTOKENS OF LAND.\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRE OF THE SPHERE--THE MYSTERIOUS SOUND--THE CONFLAGRATION.\r\n\r\n  \"Thou glorious sea! before me gleaming,\r\n  Oft wilt thou float in sunset pride,\r\n  And often shall I hear in dreaming,\r\n  Thy resonance at evening tide!\"\r\n\r\nAt sunset every trace of the storms by which we had been so recently\r\nencompassed had vanished: the sky, except along the western horizon, was\r\nwithout a cloud: not a breath of wind ruffled the sea, and we lay once\r\nmore completely becalmed.\r\n\r\nThis was our third night at sea; though to me, at least, it seemed that\r\nmany days had passed since the mutiny and the immediately succeeding\r\noccurrences.  It is a night which I shall not soon forget; the\r\nimpression of its almost unearthly beauty is still fresh and vivid, and\r\nhaunts me like a vision of fairy land.  At this moment if I but close my\r\neyes, the whole scene rises before me with the distinctness of a\r\npicture; though one would naturally suppose that persons situated as we\r\nthen were, could scarcely have been in a state of mind congenial to the\r\nreception of such impressions.\r\n\r\nThe transition from early twilight to the darkness of night was\r\nbeautiful beyond description.  The array of clouds in the west just\r\nafter sunset; their forms, arrangement, and colours; with the manner in\r\nwhich they blended and melted into one another, composed a spectacle, of\r\nthe magnificence of which, neither language, nor the art of the painter,\r\ncan convey any adequate idea.  Along the edge of the horizon stretched a\r\nbroad tract of the deepest crimson, reflecting far upon the waters, a\r\nlight that gave them the appearance of an ocean of blood.  Above this\r\nwas a band of vivid flame colour: then one of a clear translucent green,\r\nperfectly peculiar, unlike that of any leaf or gem, and of surpassing\r\ndelicacy and beauty.  This gradually melted, through many fine\r\ngradations, into a sea of liquid amber, so soft and golden, that the\r\nfirst large stars of evening, floating in its transparent depths, could\r\nscarcely be distinguished, as they twinkled mildly, amid the flood of\r\nkindred radiance.  A narrow streak of pearly blue bounded this amber sea\r\nwith its islands of light, and divided it from the deeper blue of the\r\nwide vault above.  During the earlier part of this glorious display, the\r\neastern sky, as if in rivalry of the splendour of the opposite quarter\r\nof the heavens, was spanned by two concentric rainbows, describing\r\ncomplete semi-circles, with their bases resting upon the sea.  In the\r\nsmaller and interior bow, all the colours were beautifully distinct; in\r\nthe outer and larger one, they were less brilliant, and arranged in an\r\norder the reverse of that which is usual, the violet being the lowest\r\ninstead of the red.  The rainbows vanished with the sun, and soon\r\nafterwards the fiery glow in the west began to fade.  But the scene only\r\nchanged its character, without losing any of its beauty.  So smooth was\r\nthe sea on that night that the whole dome of the sky, with every sailing\r\ncloudflake, and every star, was perfectly reflected in it.  Until the\r\nmoon rose, the line where the sky joined the ocean was indistinctly\r\ndefined, and the two were so blended together, that we actually seemed\r\nsuspended in the centre of a vast sphere; the heavens, instead of\r\nterminating at the horizon, extended, spangled with stars, on every\r\nside--below, as well as above, and around.  The illusion was wonderfully\r\nperfect; you almost held your breath as you glanced downward, and could\r\nhardly refrain from starting nervously, so strong and bewildering was\r\nthe appearance of hanging poised in empty space.\r\n\r\nJohnny, who had been sitting for a long time with his hands supporting\r\nhis head, and his elbows resting upon Arthur's knee, gazing out upon the\r\nocean, suddenly looked up into his face, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Arthur, I want you to tell me truly--do you still believe that we shall\r\nbe saved--do you hope so now, as you did yesterday, or do you think that\r\nwe must perish!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose that I would try to deceive you, Johnny,\" said Arthur,\r\n\"that you ask me so earnestly to tell you truly?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I feared you would not, perhaps, tell me the worst, thinking\r\nthat I could not bear it: and I suspected to-night, that you spoke more\r\ncheerfully than you felt on my account.  But I am not afraid, dear\r\nArthur, to know the truth; and do not hide it from me!  I will try to\r\nbear patiently, with you, and with the rest whatever comes upon us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not deceive you about such a matter, Johnny.  I should not\r\nthink it right, though you are so young.  But I can know nothing\r\ncertainly.  We are in the hands of God.  I have told you all the reasons\r\nwe have to hope; we have the same reasons still.  Only a few hours ago,\r\nthe sea supplied us with food, and the clouds with drink: why may we not\r\nhope for future supplies according to our need?  I think we yet have\r\nmore reason to hope than to despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever know, or hear of such a thing,\" inquired Johnny, after a\r\npause, \"as a company of boys, like us, starving at sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not remember that I have, under circumstances at all similar to\r\nours,\" answered Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"It is too dreadful to believe!  Is not God, our Father in heaven?  He\r\nwill not surely let us perish so miserably.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Yes_, Johnny,\" said Arthur gently, but earnestly, \"God is our heavenly\r\nFather; but we must not make our belief in his love and goodness, a\r\nground of confidence that any suffering, however terrible, shall not\r\nbefall us.  The young suffer and die, as well as the old; the good, as\r\nwell as the bad.  Not only the strong martyrs, who triumphed while they\r\nwere tortured, but feeble old men, and little children, have been torn\r\nin pieces by wild beasts, or burned alive, or cast down precipices.  And\r\nthese things, that seemed so very hard to us, God has permitted.  Yet he\r\nis good, and loves and cares for us as a father.  This we must believe,\r\nand hold fast to, in spite of every thing that in our ignorance may seem\r\nto contradict it.  If we feel as we ought, and as by his grace we may,\r\nwe shall be able to trust all to him, with sweet resignation.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is it not very hard, dear Arthur, to be left to die so!--and God\r\ncan save us so easily, if he will.\"\r\n\r\nArthur was deeply affected: the tears filled his eyes as he took Johnny\r\nupon his knee, and tried to explain to him how wrong and selfish it\r\nwould be, to make our belief in the goodness of God, depend upon our\r\nrescue and preservation.  It was a difficult task, perhaps an untimely\r\none, as Max hinted.  But Johnny gradually sobbed away his excitement,\r\nand became soothed and calm.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, after a while, drawing a long breath, and wiping away\r\nhis tears, \"I know one thing: whatever may happen, we will be kind and\r\ntrue to one another to the last, and never think of such inhuman things\r\nas I have read of shipwrecked people doing, when nearly dead with\r\nhunger, though we all starve together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come to me, Johnny,\" cried Browne, with a faltering voice, \"I must kiss\r\nyou for those words.  Yes, we will perish, if we must, like brothers,\r\nnot sullenly, as if none had ever suffered evil before us.  Weak and\r\ngentle spirits have borne without repining, sufferings as great as\r\nthreaten us.  Often has my mother told me the story of sweet Marjory\r\nWilson, drowned in the Solway water, in the days of Claverhouse, because\r\nshe met with her friends and kindred to worship God after their manner--\r\nand never could I listen to it without tears.  Ah, what a spirit was\r\nthere!  She was but eighteen, and she could have saved her life by\r\nsaying a few words.  Life was as sweet to her as it is to us: she too\r\nhad a home and friends and kindred, whom it must have been hard for the\r\npoor young thing to leave so suddenly and awfully.  And yet she refused\r\nto speak those words--she chose to die rather.  They took her out upon\r\nthe sand where the tide was rising fast, and bound her to a stake.  Soon\r\nthe water came up to her face.  She saw it go over the head of a poor\r\nold woman, whom they had tied farther out than herself.  She saw her\r\ndeath struggles; she heard her gasp for breath, as she choked and\r\nstrangled in the yellow waves.  Ah! she must have had courage from the\r\nLord, or that sight would have made her young heart fail.  Once more,\r\nand for the last time, the king's officer asked her to make the promise\r\nnever to attend a conventicle again.  He urged it, for he pitied her\r\nyouth and innocence.  Her friends and neighbours begged her to save her\r\nlife.  `O speak, dear Marjory!' they cried, `and make the promise; it\r\ncan't be wrong.  Do it for our sakes, dear Marjory, and they will let\r\nyou go!'  But she would not save her life by doing what she had been\r\ntaught to think was wrong; and while the swirling waves of the Solway\r\nwere rising fast around her, she prayed to God, and kept singing\r\nfragments of psalms, till the water choked her voice--and so she\r\nperished.  But, O friends! to know that such things have been; that\r\nspirits gentle and brave as this have lived, makes it easier to suffer\r\ncourageously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrible!\" exclaimed Max, \"I seem to see all that you have so\r\ngraphically told.  But how stern and cruel the teachers who would\r\nsacrifice human life rather than abate their own sullen obstinacy, even\r\nin trifles--who could encourage this innocent but misguided girl, in her\r\nrefusal to save her life by the harmless promise to attend a church\r\ninstead of a conventicle.\"\r\n\r\nJust as Browne was commencing an eager and indignant reply to Max's rash\r\nreflections upon the strictness of covenanting teachings, we were\r\nsuddenly startled by a deep and solemn sound, which seemed to come from\r\na distance.  While we listened intently, it was several times repeated\r\nat short intervals of about fifteen seconds, each time more distinctly\r\nthan before.  It resembled somewhat, the deepest tones of a powerful\r\norgan, heard for an instant, and then abruptly stopped.  Nothing was to\r\nbe seen in the direction from which it seemed to proceed, but the sea\r\nglittering in the moonlight.  Is it to be wondered at, if we listened\r\nwith feelings, tinged with superstitious awe, to that strange sound,\r\nheard under such circumstances, and at such an hour?  Johnny nestled\r\ncloser to Arthur's side, and I thought that the faces of my companions\r\ngrew visibly pale.  Even Arthur looked perplexed and disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"What _can_ that be?\" said Morton, after a few minutes of almost\r\nbreathless silence, during which we had listened in vain for its\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly very strange,\" said Arthur.  \"I never heard any thing\r\nat sea, at all like it, but once, and it is impossible that this can be\r\nwhat I then heard--but hark!\"  And again the same deep pealing sound was\r\nrepeated several times, at shorter intervals, but more faintly than\r\nbefore; after continuing for a few minutes it ceased again.\r\n\r\n\"What was the sound which you speak of, as resembling this?\" asked\r\nMorton, when all was silent once more.\r\n\r\n\"It was the cry of a kind of penguin, found at the Falkland Islands;\r\nwhen heard on shore it is harsh and loud; but a short distance at sea,\r\nand in the night, it has a pealing, solemn sound, like that which we\r\nhave just heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must come from land in the neighbourhood,\" said Morton, \"we can\r\nprobably hear farther on such a night as this than we can distinguish\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sounds on the water, in calm still nights, when there is no wind,\r\ncan be heard at great distances,\" said Arthur; \"it is said that the\r\n`All's well!' of the British sentinel at Gibraltar, is sometimes heard\r\nacross the strait, on the African shore, a distance of thirteen miles.\r\nI have seen, at the Society Islands, native drums made of large hollow\r\nlogs, which might perhaps, at a distance, sound like what we heard a\r\nmoment ago.  A Wesleyan missionary there, once told me of a great drum\r\nthat he saw at the Tonga Islands, called the `Tonga Toki,' which sounded\r\nlike an immense gong, and could be heard from seven to ten miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I thought that _this_ sounded like a gong,\" said Johnny, \"perhaps\r\nwe are near some island now; but what could they be drumming for so late\r\nin the night?\"\r\n\r\n\"There would be nothing very unusual about that,\" said Arthur.  \"The\r\nAreoi Societies, which are extended over most of the larger inhabited\r\nislands in this part of the Pacific, sometimes hold their great\r\ncelebrations, like the pow-wows, and war-dances, of our American\r\nIndians, in the night-time.  At the Feejee Islands they have a strange\r\nceremony called `Tambo Nalanga,' which they celebrate at night, with the\r\nbeating of drums, the blowing of conches, and a number of savage and\r\ncruel rites.  Something or other of the same kind is observed at most of\r\nthe islands, though under different names, and with slight variations.\"\r\n\r\nWhile speculating in this way, and endeavouring to account for the noise\r\nwhich had startled us so much, we all at once became aware of an\r\nincreasing light in the south, the `Cross,' now half-way between the\r\nhorizon and the zenith, enabling us to fix the points of the compass.\r\nAs we gazed in that direction, the sky became strongly illuminated by a\r\nred glare, and an immense column of flame and smoke was seen shooting up\r\nin the distance.  Nothing but the expanse of the ocean, splendidly\r\nilluminated, and glowing like a sea of fire, could be discerned by this\r\nlight.  Whether it was caused by a burning ship, at such a distance that\r\nnothing but the light of her conflagration was visible, or by a fire on\r\nsome distant island, we could not determine.  It was in the same quarter\r\nfrom which the sound had seemed to come.\r\n\r\nArthur was now of the opinion that we were in the neighbourhood of an\r\ninhabited island, or group, and that the light proceeded from the\r\nburning beche-de-mer house of some successful trader, who had set fire\r\nto it, (as is their custom at the end of a prosperous season), to\r\nprevent it from falling into the hands of others in the same business.\r\n\r\nWe all grasped eagerly at this idea, for the probability that we were\r\nnot only in the neighbourhood of land, but of a place where we should\r\nmeet with Europeans, and have an opportunity of getting home, or perhaps\r\nto the places of our respective destination, was full of encouragement.\r\nIn a very short time the conflagration was over, and a dark column of\r\nsmoke, which marked the spot where it had raged, was lifted slowly into\r\nthe air.  We heard no more of the mysterious sound.  None of the\r\nexplanations suggested were so perfectly satisfactory, as to remove\r\nentirely the unpleasant impression which it had produced.  Before lying\r\ndown in our accustomed places, we made our usual arrangements as to the\r\nwatch, unnecessary as it seemed, during the calm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nDARK WATERS.\r\n\r\nSUFFERING AND DELIRIUM--THE MIDNIGHT BATH--A STRANGE PERIL.\r\n\r\n  \"Water, water, everywhere,\r\n  And all the boards did shrink;\r\n  Water, water, everywhere--\r\n  But not a drop to drink.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral times in the course of the night, I was awakened by confused\r\nnoises, like the blowing of porpoises, or the spouting of whales; but\r\nthe sky had become overcast, and it had grown so dark, that on getting\r\nup and looking about, I could see nothing of the creatures producing\r\nthese sounds.  My slumbers were broken and uneasy, and in the morning I\r\nfound myself suffering from a dull, heavy pain in the head, accompanied\r\nby a slight nausea, and a general feeling of languor and weakness.  Even\r\nto get upon my feet required something of an effort, which I made,\r\nimpelled rather by a dim, confused sense of duty, than by any\r\nspontaneous impulse or inclination: had I consulted inclination alone, I\r\nbelieve I should have remained passive, and let things take their\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe occurrences of the last night had given rise to some faint\r\nexpectation that by daylight we should discover land in sight to the\r\nsouthward, where we had seen the great light.  But nothing was visible\r\nin that or any other quarter.  Possessed by some hope of this kind,\r\nArthur had been up, searching the horizon, since the first streak of day\r\nin the east.  He showed me a large green branch which he had picked up\r\nas it floated near us.  By the elegantly scolloped leaves, of a dark and\r\nglossy green, it was easily recognised as a branch of the bread-fruit\r\ntree; and from their bright, fresh colour, and the whiteness of the\r\nwood, where it had joined the trunk, it must have been torn off quite\r\nrecently.  The calm still continued.  Immense schools of black-fish, or\r\nporpoises, or some similar species, could be seen about half a mile\r\ndistant, passing westward, in an apparently endless line.  The temporary\r\nbeneficial effect of yesterday's scanty supply of food and drink, had\r\npassed away entirely, and all seemed to feel in a greater or less\r\ndegree, the bodily pain and weakness, and the lassitude and\r\nindisposition to any kind of effort, by which I was affected.  To such\r\nan extent was this the case, that when Arthur proposed that we should\r\nrow towards the school of fish in sight, and try to take some of them,\r\nthe strongest disinclination to make any such attempt was evinced, and\r\nit was only after much argument and persuasion, and by direct personal\r\nappeals to us individually, that he overcame this strange torpor, and\r\ninduced us to take to the oars.\r\n\r\nOn getting near enough to the objects of our pursuit to distinguish them\r\nplainly, we were sorry to find that they were Porpoises instead of\r\nblack-fish, as we had at first supposed; the former being shy and timid,\r\nand much more difficult to approach than the latter; and so they proved\r\nat present.  Still we persevered for a while; the hope of obtaining food\r\nhaving been once excited, we were almost as reluctant to abandon the\r\nattempt as we had been at first to commence it.  But after half an\r\nhour's severe labour at the oars, we were obliged to give it up as quite\r\nhopeless, and soon afterward the last of the long column passed beyond\r\npursuit, leaving us completely disheartened and worn out.  The sail was\r\nagain arranged so as to shelter us as much as possible from the sun, and\r\nArthur commenced distributing the leaves and twigs of the bread-fruit\r\nbranch, suggesting that some slight refreshment might perhaps be derived\r\nfrom chewing them.  But they retained a saline taste from having been in\r\nthe sea-water, and no one proceeded far with the experiment.  Morton cut\r\nsome small slips of leather from his boots, and began to chew them.  He\r\nfancied that they afforded some nourishment, and recommended the rest of\r\nus to make a similar trial, which I believe we all did.  Max almost\r\nimmediately rejected with disgust the first morsel which he put into his\r\nmouth, saying that he must \"starve a little longer before he could\r\nrelish that.\"  At noon the heat was more intense, if possible, than it\r\nhad been the day before.  Johnny was now in a high fever, accompanied by\r\nsymptoms of an alarming character.  It was distressing to witness his\r\nsufferings, and feel utterly unable to do any thing for him.  Yet there\r\nwas nothing that we could do--food and drink were the only medicines he\r\nneeded, and these we could not give him.  Towards the close of the\r\nafternoon he became delirious, and began to cry out violently and\r\nincessantly for water.  His voice seemed to have changed, and could now\r\nscarcely be recognised.  There was something very strange and horrible\r\nin the regular, unceasing cries which he uttered, and which sounded at\r\ntimes almost like the howlings of a brute.  Arthur had made a sort of\r\nbed for him, to which each of us contributed such articles of clothing\r\nas could be spared.  It was now necessary to watch him every moment and\r\nfrequently to use force to keep him from getting overboard.  At one\r\ntime, having got to the side of the boat, before he could be prevented,\r\nhe commenced dipping up the sea-water with his hand, and would have\r\ndrunk it had he not been forcibly restrained.  After this had lasted\r\nnearly two hours, he suddenly ceased his struggles and violent cries,\r\nand began to beg piteously for \"a drink of water.\"  This he continued\r\nfor a considerable time, repeatedly asking Arthur to tell him _why_ he\r\ncould not have \"just a little,\" since there was \"such a plenty of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the horrible and sickening effect of all\r\nthis upon us, in the state of utter physical prostration to which we had\r\nbeen gradually reduced.  Browne and Arthur watched over Johnny with all\r\nthe care and patient unwearying kindness that a mother could have shown;\r\nand they would not permit the rest of us to relieve them for a moment,\r\nor to share any part of their charge, painful and distressing as it was.\r\nTwice, when it became necessary to hold the little sufferer fast, to\r\nprevent him from getting over the gunwale, he spat fiercely in Arthur's\r\nface, struggling and crying out with frightful vehemence.  But Browne's\r\nvoice seemed to soothe and control him, and when Johnny spoke to him, it\r\nwas gently, and in the language of entreaty.  Towards night he became\r\nmore quiet, and at last sunk into a kind of lethargy, breathing deeply\r\nand heavily, but neither speaking nor moving, except to turn from one\r\nside to the other, which he did at nearly regular intervals.\r\n\r\nThis change relieved us from the necessity of constantly watching and\r\nrestraining him, but Arthur viewed it as an unfavourable and alarming\r\nsymptom; he seemed now more completely depressed than I had ever before\r\nseen him, and to be overcome at last by grief, anxiety, and the horrors\r\nof our situation.\r\n\r\nThe heat did not abate in the least with the going down of the sun, but\r\nthe night, though very close and sultry, was calm and beautiful, like\r\nthe last.  Soon after the moon rose, Max and Morton undressed, and\r\nbathed themselves in the sea.  The smooth moonlit water looked so cool\r\nand inviting, that the rest of us soon followed their example,\r\nnotwithstanding the danger from sharks.  We were all good swimmers, but\r\nno one ventured far from the boat except Morton; I found that a few\r\nstrokes quite exhausted me, and I was obliged to turn and cling to the\r\ngunwale.  In fact, so great was the loss of strength which we had all\r\nsuffered, that we came near perishing in a very singular and almost\r\nincredible manner: After having been in the water a sufficient time, as\r\nI thought, I discovered, on trying to get into the boat again, that I\r\nwas utterly unable to do so, through sheer weakness.  At the same time I\r\nobserved Max making a similar attempt nearer the stern, with no better\r\nsuccess.  We were all in the water except Johnny; any difficulty in\r\ngetting into the boat again had not been dreamed of; but I began now to\r\nfeel seriously alarmed.  My feet were drawn forcibly under the boat's\r\nbottom, and even to maintain my hold of the gunwale, as we rose and sunk\r\nwith the swell, required an exhausting effort, which I knew I could not\r\nlong continue.  Arthur was swimming near the stern, holding on to the\r\nend of a rope, which he had cast over before coming in.  By great\r\nexertion I raised myself so far as to be able to look over the gunwale,\r\nwhen I saw Browne in the same position directly opposite me.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you get into the boat!\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Really, I don't think I can,\" said he, speaking like a person\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" added Max, faintly, \"it is as much as I can do to maintain my\r\nhold.\"  At this moment a voice was heard, calling out apparently from a\r\ndistance, \"Hilloa! where are you?  Hilloa!\"  It was hoarse, strained,\r\nand distressed.  Almost immediately the cry was repeated, much nearer at\r\nhand, as it seemed; and then, a third time, faint, and distant as at\r\nfirst.  I was horror-stricken; the cry sounded strange and fearful, and\r\nI did not recognise the voice.  Then it occurred to me that it must be\r\nMorton, who had swum out farther than the rest, and losing sight of the\r\nboat for a moment in the swell of the sea, had become bewildered and\r\nalarmed.  This might easily happen; if but the length of a wave distant\r\nwe should be invisible to him, unless both should chance to rise on the\r\nswell at the same time.  The moon, too, had just passed behind a dark\r\nmass of cloud, and the sea lay in partial obscurity.  I now heard Browne\r\nand Arthur shouting, in order, as I supposed, to guide Morton by the\r\nsound of their voices.  I, too, called out as loudly as I was able.  For\r\na moment all was still again.  Then I heard some one say, \"There he is!\"\r\nand a dark speck appeared on the crest of a wave a little to the right.\r\nAt this moment the moon shone out brightly! and I saw that it was\r\nMorton, swimming toward us.  He reached the boat panting and out of\r\nbreath, and catching hold near me with an almost convulsive effort,\r\nremained some minutes without being able to speak a word.  Arthur, who\r\nhad observed Max's struggles to get into the yawl, now swam round to\r\nwhere Morton and I were hanging on, and taking hold also, his additional\r\nweight depressed the gunwale nearly to the water's edge, when he got his\r\nknee over it, and at last, by a sudden effort rolled into the boat.  He\r\nthen helped me to get in, and we two the rest.\r\n\r\nMorton said that after swimming but a short distance from the boat, as\r\nhe supposed, he found himself getting tired and very weak, and on\r\nturning, greatly to his surprise, could see nothing of us.  In reality,\r\nhowever, there was nothing surprising in this, his face being on a level\r\nwith the surface, and the boat with neither sail nor mast up, being much\r\nless in height than the long smooth swells.  Perceiving how great was\r\nhis danger, and becoming somewhat alarmed, he had called out in the\r\nmanner described: when he heard us shouting in return, he was actually\r\nswimming _away_ from us, and it was only by following the direction of\r\nour voices that he had at last reached the boat.\r\n\r\nThat night we kept no regular watch as we had hitherto done, or at least\r\nwe made no arrangement for that purpose, though one or another of us was\r\nawake most of the time, watching Johnny, who continued, however, in the\r\nsame deep lethargic slumber.\r\n\r\nFor my part, it was a long time before I could sleep at all.  There was\r\nsomething in the fate that threatened us, more appalling than the\r\nterrors of death.  The impressions produced by the ravings, and cries,\r\nand struggles, of our poor little fellow-sufferer were yet fresh, and\r\nthey could not be effaced.  All in vain I strove to control the workings\r\nof my morbidly excited imagination--I could not shut out the fearful\r\nthoughts and anticipations which the occurrences of the day so naturally\r\nand obviously suggested.  The lapse of twenty-four hours might find us\r\nall reduced to the same helpless state, deprived of consciousness and\r\nreason.  One after another must succumb to the fever and become\r\ndelirious, until he who should last fall its victim, should find himself\r\nalone in the midst of his stricken and raving companions--alone\r\nretaining reason, no longer to be accounted a blessing, since it could\r\nonly serve to make him sensible to all the accumulated horrors of his\r\nsituation.  I shuddered as I contemplated the possibility that I might\r\nbe the most wretched one, the last of all to sink and perish.  At\r\nlength, I began to imagine that my mind was actually beginning to fail,\r\nand that I was becoming delirious.  At first it was but a fearful\r\nsuspicion.  Soon, however, it took such strong possession of me, that I\r\nwas compelled to relinquish all thought of sleep.  Sitting up, I saw\r\nthat Arthur was awake and by the side of Johnny.  His face was upturned,\r\nand his hands clasped as if in prayer.  I could see his lips move, and\r\neven the tears trickling from beneath his closed lids, for the moonlight\r\nfell upon his countenance.  He did not observe me, and after a few\r\nmoments he laid down again without speaking, and soon appeared to\r\nslumber like the rest.\r\n\r\nPressing my hands to my head, I leaned over the stern, my face almost\r\ntouching the water.  A current of cooler air was stirring close to the\r\nsurface, as if it were the breathing of the sea, for there was no wind.\r\nHow preternaturally still every thing seemed--what an intensity of\r\nsilence!  How softly the pale moonlight rested upon the water!  A grand\r\nand solemn repose wrapped the heavens and the ocean--no sound beneath\r\nall that vast blue dome--no motion, but the heaving of the long sluggish\r\nswell.  Gradually I became calmer; the excitement and perturbation of my\r\nmind began to subside, and at length I felt as though I could sleep.  As\r\nI resumed my place by the side of Browne, he moved, as if about to\r\nawake, and murmured indistinctly some broken sentences.  From the words\r\nthat escaped him, he was dreaming of that far-off home which he was to\r\nbehold no more.  In fancy he was wandering again by the banks of the\r\nClyde, the scene of many a school-boy ramble.  But it seemed as though\r\nthe shadow of present realities darkened even his dreams, and he beheld\r\nthese familiar haunts no longer in the joyous light of early days.  \"How\r\nstrange it looks!\" he muttered slowly, \"how dark the river is--how deep\r\nand dark!--it seems to me it was not so _then_, Robert.\"  Truly,\r\ncompanion in suffering, this is no falsely coloured dream of thine, for\r\nwe have all come at last into deep and dark waters!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nA SAIL.\r\n\r\nTHE CACHELOT AND HIS ASSAILANTS--THE COURSE--NEW ACQUAINTANCES.\r\n\r\n  \"Strange creatures round us sweep:\r\n  Strange things come up to look at us,\r\n  The monsters of the deep.\"\r\n\r\nThe first thought that flashed through my mind with returning\r\nconsciousness, in the morning, was, \"This is the last day for hope--\r\nunless relief comes to-day in some shape, we must perish.\"  I was the\r\nfirst awake, and glancing at the faces of my companions lying about in\r\nthe bottom of the boat, I could not help shuddering.  They had a strange\r\nand unnatural look--a miserable expression of pain and weakness.  All\r\nthat was familiar and pleasant to look upon, had vanished from those\r\nsharpened and haggard features.  Their closed eyes seemed singularly\r\nsunken; and their matted hair, sunburned skin, and soiled clothing,\r\nadded something of wildness to the misery of their appearance.\r\n\r\nBrowne, who had slept beside me, was breathing hard, and started every\r\nnow and then, as if in pain.  Johnny slumbered so peacefully, and\r\nbreathed so gently, that for a moment I was alarmed, and doubted whether\r\nhe was breathing at all, until I stooped down and watched him closely.\r\nThere were still no indications of a breeze.  A school of whales was\r\nvisible about a quarter of a mile to the westward, spouting and pursuing\r\ntheir unwieldy sport; but I took no interest in the sight, and leaning\r\nover the gunwale, commenced bathing my head and eyes with the sea-water.\r\nWhile thus engaged I was startled by seeing an enormous cachelot, (the\r\nsperm-whale), suddenly break the water within fifteen yards of the boat.\r\nIts head, which composed nearly a third of its entire bulk, seemed a\r\nmountain of flesh.  A couple of small calves followed it, and came\r\nswimming playfully around us.  For a minute or two, the cachelot floated\r\nquietly at the surface, where it had first appeared, throwing a slender\r\njet of water, together with a large volume of spray and vapour into the\r\nair; then rolling over upon its side, it began to lash the sea with its\r\nbroad and powerful tail, every stroke of which produced a sound like the\r\nreport of a cannon.  This roused the sleepers abruptly, and just as they\r\nsprang up, and began to look around in astonishment, for the cause of so\r\nstartling a commotion, the creature cast its misshapen head downwards,\r\nand, throwing its immense flukes high into the air, disappeared.  We\r\nwatched anxiously to see where it would rise, conscious of the perils of\r\nsuch a neighbourhood, and that even a playful movement, a random sweep\r\nof the tail, while pursuing its gigantic pastime, would be sufficient to\r\ndestroy us.  It came to the surface at about the same distance as\r\nbefore, but on the opposite side of the boat, throwing itself half out\r\nof the water as it rose: again it commenced lashing the sea violently,\r\nas if in the mere wanton display of its terrible strength, until far\r\naround, the water was one wide sheet of foam.  The calves still\r\ngambolled near us, chasing each other about and under the yawl, and we\r\nmight easily have killed one of them, had we not been deterred by the\r\nalmost certain consequences of arousing the fury of the old whale.\r\nMeantime, the entire school seemed to be edging down towards us.  There\r\nwas not a breath of air, and we had no means of getting out of the way\r\nof the danger, to which we should be exposed, if among them, except by\r\ntaking to the oars; and this, nothing short of the most pressing and\r\nimmediate peril could induce us to do.  But our attention was soon\r\nwithdrawn from the herd, to the singular and alarming movements of the\r\nindividual near us.  Rushing along the surface for short distances, it\r\nthrew itself several times half clear of the water, turning after each\r\nof these leaps, as abruptly as its unwieldy bulk would permit, and\r\nrunning a tilt with equal violence in the opposite direction.  Once, it\r\npassed so near us, that I think I could have touched it with an oar, and\r\nwe saw distinctly its small, dull eye, and the loose, wrinkled, folds of\r\nskin, about its tremendous jaws.  For a minute afterwards, the boat\r\nrolled dangerously in the swell caused by the swift passage of so vast\r\nan object.  Suddenly, after one of these abrupt turns, the monster\r\nheaded directly towards us, and came rushing onward with fearful\r\nvelocity, either not noticing us at all, or else mistaking the boat for\r\nsome sea-creature, with which it designed to measure its strength.\r\nThere was no time for any effort to avoid the danger; and even had there\r\nbeen, we were too much paralysed by its imminence, to make such an\r\neffort.  The whale was scarcely twelve yards off--certainly not twenty.\r\nBehind it stretched a foaming wake, straight as an arrow.  Its vast\r\nmountainous head ploughed up the waves like a ship's cutwater, piling\r\nhigh the foam and spray before it.  To miss us was now a sheer\r\nimpossibility and no earthly power could arrest the creature's career.\r\nInstant destruction appeared inevitable.  I grew dizzy, and my head\r\nbegan to swim, while the thought flashed confusedly through my mind,\r\nthat infinite wisdom had decreed that we must die, and this manner of\r\nperishing had been chosen in mercy, to spare us the prolonged horrors of\r\nstarvation.  What a multitude of incoherent thoughts and recollections\r\ncrowded upon my mind in that moment of time!  A thousand little\r\nincidents of my past life, disconnected and trivial--a shadowy throng of\r\nfamiliar scenes and faces, surged up before me, vividly as objects\r\nrevealed for an instant by the glare of the lightning, in the gloom of a\r\nstormy night.  Closing my eyes, I silently commended my soul to God, and\r\nwas endeavouring to compose myself for the dreadful event when Morton\r\nsprang to his feet, and called hurriedly upon us to shout together.  All\r\nseemed to catch his intention at once, and to perceive in it a gleam of\r\nhope; and standing up we raised our voices in a hoarse cry, that sounded\r\nstrange and startling even to ourselves.  Instantly, as it seemed, the\r\nwhale drove almost perpendicularly downwards, but so great was its\r\nmomentum, that its fluked tail cut the air within an oar's length of the\r\nboat as it disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhether the shout we had uttered, caused the sudden plunge to which we\r\nowed our preservation, it is impossible to decide.  Notwithstanding its\r\nbulk and power, the cachelot is said to be a timid creature, except when\r\ninjured or enraged, and great caution has to be exercised by whalers in\r\napproaching them.  Suddenly recollecting this, the thought of\r\nundertaking to scare the formidable monster, had suggested itself to\r\nMorton, and he had acted upon it in sheer desperation, impelled by the\r\nsame instinct that causes a drowning man to catch even at a straw.\r\n\r\nBut, however obtained, our reprieve from danger was only momentary.  The\r\nwhale came to the surface at no great distance, and once more headed\r\ntowards us.  If frightened for an instant, it had quickly recovered from\r\nthe panic, and now there was no mistaking the creature's purpose: it\r\ncame on, exhibiting every mark of rage, and with jaws literally wide\r\nopen.  We felt that no device or effort of our own could be of any\r\navail.  We might as well hope to resist a tempest, or an earthquake, or\r\nthe shock of a falling mountain, as that immense mass of matter,\r\ninstinct with life and power, and apparently animated by brute fury.\r\n\r\nEvery hope had vanished, and I think that we were all in a great measure\r\nresigned to death, and fully expecting it when there came, (as it seemed\r\nto us, by actual miracle), a most wonderful interposition.\r\n\r\nA dark, bulky mass, (in the utter bewilderment of the moment we noted\r\nnothing distinctly of its appearance), shot perpendicularly from the sea\r\ntwenty feet into the air, and fell with a tremendous concussion,\r\ndirectly upon the whale's back.  It must have been several tons in\r\nweight, and the blow inflicted was crushing.  For a moment the whale\r\nseemed paralysed by the shock, and its vast frame quivered with agony;\r\nbut recovering quickly, it rushed with open jaws upon its strange\r\nassailant which immediately dived, and both vanished.  Very soon, the\r\nwhale came to the surface again; and now we became the witnesses of one\r\nof those singular and tremendous spectacles, of which the vast solitudes\r\nof the tropical seas are doubtless often the theatre, but which human\r\neyes have rarely beheld.\r\n\r\nThe cachelot seemed to be attacked by two powerful confederates, acting\r\nin concert.  The one assailed it from below, and continually drove it to\r\nthe surface, while the other--the dark bulky object--repeated its\r\nsingular attacks in precisely the same manner as at first, whenever any\r\npart of the gigantic frame of the whale was exposed, never once missing\r\nits mark, and inflicting blows, which one would think, singly sufficient\r\nto destroy any living creature.  At times the conflict was carried on so\r\nnear us, as to endanger our safety; and we could see all of the\r\ncombatants with the utmost distinctness, though not at the same time.\r\nThe first glimpse which we caught of the second antagonist of the whale,\r\nas it rose through the water to the attack, enabled us at once to\r\nidentify it as that most fierce and formidable creature--the Pacific\r\nSword-fish.\r\n\r\nThe other, as I now had an opportunity to observe, was a fish of full\r\none third the length of the whale itself, and of enormous bulk in\r\nproportion; it was covered with a dark rough skin, in appearance not\r\nunlike that of an alligator.  The cachelot rushed upon its foes\r\nalternately, and the one thus singled out invariably fled, until the\r\nother had an opportunity to come to its assistance; the sword-fish\r\nswimming around in a wide circle at the top of the water, when pursued,\r\nand the other diving when chased in its turn.  If the whale followed the\r\nsword-fish to the surface, it was sure to receive a stunning blow from\r\nits leaping enemy; if it pursued the latter below, the sword-fish there\r\nattacked it fearlessly, and, as it appeared, successfully, forcing it\r\nquickly back to the top of the water.\r\n\r\nPresently the battle began to recede from us, the whale evidently making\r\ntowards the school, which was at no great distance; and strange as the\r\nsight was, we watched it with but a languid interest, as soon as our\r\nsafety appeared to be no longer involved.  The whale must have been\r\nbadly hurt for the water which it threw up on coming to the surface and\r\nspouting, was tinged with blood.  After this I saw no more of the\r\nsword-fish and his associate; they had probably abandoned the attack.\r\n[See note.] As nearly as I can recollect, we did not, either during the\r\nprogress of the fight, or after it was over, exchange a single word on\r\nthe subject, so dumb and apathetic had we become.  After a while the\r\nschool of whales appeared to be moving off, and in half an hour more, we\r\nlost sight of them altogether.\r\n\r\nAll this while, Johnny had continued to sleep soundly, and his slumbers\r\nseemed more natural and refreshing than before.  When at length he\r\nawoke, the delirium had ceased, and he was calm and gentle, but so weak\r\nthat he could not sit up without being supported.  After the\r\ndisappearance of the whales, several hours passed, during which we lay\r\nunder our awning without a word being spoken by any one.  Throughout\r\nthis day, the sea seemed to be alive with fish; myriads of them were to\r\nbe seen in every direction; troops of agile and graceful dolphins;\r\nrevolving black-fish, chased by ravenous sharks; leaping albatross,\r\ndazzling the eye with the flash of their golden scales, as they shot\r\ninto the air for a moment; porpoises, bonito, flying-fish, and a hundred\r\nunknown kinds which I had never seen or heard of.  At one time we were\r\nsurrounded by an immense shoal of small fishes, about the size of\r\nmackerel, so densely crowded together that their backs presented an\r\nalmost solid surface, on which it seemed as if one might walk dry-shod.\r\nNone, however, came actually within our reach, and we made no effort to\r\napproach them.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of our wonderful escape from being destroyed by the whale,\r\nuntil the occurrence which I am about to relate, I remember nothing\r\ndistinctly--all seems vague and dream-like.  I could not say with\r\nconfidence, from my own knowledge, whether the interval consisted of\r\nseveral days, or of only a few feverish and half-delirious hours; nor\r\nwhether the sights and sounds of which I have a confused recollection,\r\nwere real, or imaginary.  I think, however, that it must have been in\r\nthe afternoon of the same day, (Arthur is confident that it was), that\r\nMorton came to me as I lay in the bottom of the boat in a state of utter\r\ndesperation and self-abandonment and aroused me, saying in a hoarse and\r\npainful whisper, that there was a vessel in sight.  Even this\r\nannouncement hardly sufficed to overcome the stupor into which I had\r\nsunk, and it was with a reluctant effort, and a feeling akin to\r\nannoyance at being disturbed, that I sat up and looked around me.  My\r\neyes were so much inflamed that I could see nothing distinctly.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that I observed, was, that the calm was at an end.  A\r\nbreeze had sprung up, and was blowing gently but pretty steadily from\r\nthe south.  The surface of the sea was slightly ruffled, and its dead\r\nstagnant aspect, had given place to one of breezy freshness.  In this\r\nchange there was something reviving and strengthening.  Far to the\r\nsouth, where Morton pointed out the vessel which he had discovered, I\r\ncould just distinguish a white speck upon the water, which seemed more\r\nlike the crest of a wave than any thing else.  Morton had already called\r\nArthur's attention to it, and he was watching it intently.  Gradually it\r\nbecame more distinct, and in half an hour, I too, could make it out\r\nplainly, to be a small sailing vessel of some description.  As she was\r\ncoming directly down before the wind, there seemed to be no need of\r\ndoing any thing to attract her attention.  I now hastened to reanimate\r\nMax and Browne, by communicating to them the intelligence that relief\r\nwas probably at hand.  In three-quarters of an hour more, the strange\r\nsail was near enough to enable us to see that she was a large double\r\ncanoe, such as is used by some of the islanders of the South Pacific, in\r\ntheir trading voyages.  It had two masts, with large triangular\r\nmat-sails, and appeared to contain six or seven persons only, whom we\r\nsupposed to be natives of some neighbouring island.  As soon as they\r\nwere within speaking distance, one of them, to our great astonishment\r\nhailed us in French.  Arthur undertook to answer in the same language,\r\nwhen the other, probably perceiving that the French was not his native\r\ntongue, spoke to us in tolerable English, but with a strong French\r\naccent.  It was easy to perceive, now that our attention was\r\nparticularly called to him, that the spokesman was a European.  Though\r\nalmost naked like the rest, and elaborately tattooed upon the chest and\r\nshoulders, his light hair and beard, and florid though sun-burnt skin,\r\nsufficiently distinguished him from them.  Of course the first thing\r\nwith us, was to make known our wants, and to ask for food, and above all\r\nfor water.  As soon as they could bring the canoe near enough, the\r\nFrenchman watching his opportunity, reached out to us a large gourd\r\ncontaining water, of which we drank plentifully, passing it round\r\nseveral times.  Arthur hastened to pour a little into Johnny's mouth,\r\nand the effect was astonishing: he seemed to revive almost\r\ninstantaneously, and, sitting up, he seized the gourd himself and drank\r\neagerly as long as Arthur would let him.  The Frenchman next tossed us\r\nsomething wrapped in banana leaves, a thick, dark-coloured paste of some\r\nkind.  It was enough that it was an article of food, and we devoured it\r\nwithout pausing for any very close examination, though its appearance\r\nwas by no means inviting, and it had a crude and slightly acid taste.\r\nHe threw us also several thin, hard cakes, similar in taste and colour\r\nto the other substance.  Both were probably preparations of the\r\nbread-fruit, the latter being dried and hardened in the sun, or by fire.\r\nRavenously hungry as we were, these supplies were divided and\r\napportioned with the most scrupulous exactness.  On finding that the\r\nnatives were well supplied with water, having several large gourds full,\r\nwe passed the calabash round again, until we had drained it dry, when\r\nthey gave us another gourd.  Meanwhile, though we were too busy to look\r\nabout us much, the canoe's people watched us very narrowly, and in such\r\na manner as to make me feel uneasy and doubtful as to their intentions,\r\nnotwithstanding their kindness thus far.  As soon as the first cravings\r\nof hunger and thirst were satisfied, I began to return their scrutiny,\r\nand I now observed that they differed in many respects from the\r\nTahitians, and from all the other Polynesian tribes of which I knew any\r\nthing.  Their complexion was a clear olive; their faces oval, with\r\nregular features; their hair straight and black; their eyes large, and\r\nthe general expression of their countenances simple and pleasing, though\r\nthere were several keen, crafty-looking faces among them.  All were\r\ntattooed, more or less profusely, the chests of some resembling\r\nchecker-boards, and others being ornamented with rosettes, and\r\nrepresentations of various natural objects, as birds, fishes, trees,\r\netcetera.  Their only clothing consisted of the maro, a strip of tappa,\r\nor native cloth, tied round the loins.  A wave happening to throw the\r\nboats nearly together, one of the natives caught hold of our gunwale at\r\nthe stern, and another at the bow, and thus kept the canoe alongside.\r\n\r\nThey now began to cast searching glances at us, and at every thing in\r\nthe yawl.  I observed the Frenchman intently eyeing the handle of one of\r\nthe cutlasses, which protruded from beneath a fold of canvass.  He\r\ninquired eagerly whether we had any fire-arms, and seemed greatly\r\ndisappointed to find that we had not.  He next asked for tobacco, with\r\nno better success, which apparently surprised him very much, for he\r\nshrugged his shoulders, and raised his thick eyebrows with a doubtful\r\nand incredulous look.  At this moment the gilt buttons upon Max's jacket\r\nseemed to strike the fancy of one of our new friends, and excited his\r\ncupidity to such a degree, that after fixing upon them a long and\r\nadmiring gaze, he suddenly reached over and made a snatch at them.  He\r\ngot hold of one, and in trying to pull it off came very near jerking Max\r\noverboard.  Morton, who was sitting next to Max, interfered, and caught\r\nthe man by the arm, with a look and manner that made me fear he might do\r\nsomething imprudent.  The savage, who was an athletic fellow,\r\nobstinately maintained his hold of Max's jacket, and casting a ferocious\r\nglance at Morton, snatched up a short, thick paddle, and brandished it\r\nover his head as if about to strike.  Arthur appealed to the Frenchman\r\nto interpose, but before he could do so, one of the natives, a handsome\r\nboy, who was seated cross-legged upon a platform between the masts,\r\nspoke to the man in a raised voice, and with an air of authority,\r\nwhereupon, to my surprise, he immediately dropped the paddle, and\r\nsullenly desisted from his attempt.  This lad, who seemed to be so\r\npromptly obeyed, did not look to be more than thirteen or fourteen years\r\nof age.  His voice was soft and girlish; he had a remarkably open and\r\npleasing countenance, and surveyed us with an air of friendly interest,\r\nvery different from the sinister and greedy looks of several of the\r\nothers, including the Frenchman himself.  In answer to the questions of\r\nthe latter, Arthur told him that we were Americans, and related very\r\nbriefly how we had come into our present situation.  He then informed us\r\nin turn, that he had been cast away, some six years before, in a French\r\nbarque engaged in the tortoise-shell traffic, upon an uninhabited\r\nisland, about forty miles from the one where he and those with him, now\r\nlived.  After remaining there for more than a year, he and his\r\ncompanions, having reason to believe that they were in the neighbourhood\r\nof a group occasionally visited by trading vessels, had set out in\r\nsearch of it, in a small boat.  Their belief as to the existence and\r\nsituation of these islands proved to be well founded; they had finally\r\nsucceeded in reaching them, had been hospitably received and treated by\r\nthe natives, among whom they had acquired considerable influence, but\r\nhad as yet had no opportunity of returning home.\r\n\r\nThey were now, he said, on their return from a trading voyage to a\r\nneighbouring island, where they had just disposed of a cargo of mats and\r\ntappa, in exchange for baskets of native manufacture, and sharks' teeth.\r\nHaving been becalmed all the preceding day and night, they feared that\r\nthey had drifted out of their course, since, otherwise, they ought,\r\nafter making full allowance for the calm, to have already reached their\r\nown island.  He finished by assuring us, that we might calculate with\r\nconfidence, upon enjoying perfect security and kind treatment among\r\nthese people.\r\n\r\nThe conference being concluded, he directed us to put up our sail, and\r\nsteer after the canoe; adding that he expected to reach the group before\r\nmidnight if the wind held fair.  He spoke with the air of one delivering\r\na command, and evidently considered us entirely under his control.  But\r\nof course we felt no disposition to object to what he directed.  The\r\nfact, that the natives had treated him and his companions so well, was\r\nan encouragement to us, as affording some proof of their friendly and\r\npeaceful character, and we supposed that he could have no possible\r\nmotive for using his influence to our prejudice.  Even had there been\r\nany other course for us to choose, to escape perishing, we were in no\r\ncondition to make any effectual opposition to the will of our new\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNote.  This fish story has several rather astonishing features--at least\r\nto an inexperienced landsman.  The sword-fish and thresher are said to\r\nseek and attack the right whale together; but a nautical friend, whom I\r\nhave consulted on the subject, says he has never heard of their\r\ninterfering with the cachelot, or sperm-whale, which would, he thinks,\r\nbe very likely to make mince-meat of them both, should they be guilty of\r\nsuch temerity: the right whale uses no other weapon than his powerful\r\ntail; whereas the cachelot goes at an adversary with open jaws.  Upon my\r\ninquiry whether threshers, \"of several tons weight,\" and jumping \"twenty\r\nfeet into the air,\" were common, my friend the captain, seemed piqued at\r\nmy implied scepticism as to marine monsters, and briefly made answer,\r\nthat there were more strange creatures in the sea, than were dreamed of\r\nin my philosophy, and that \"many an old sailor could give more real\r\ninformation on the subject, than all the natural history books in the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nA CATASTROPHE.\r\n\r\nTHE WHIRLING COLUMNS--A STUPENDOUS SPECTACLE--WE LOSE OUR NEW FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n  \"Still round and round the fluid vortex flies,\r\n  Scattering dun night, and horror through the skies,\r\n  The swift volution and the enormous train\r\n  Let sages versed in Nature's lore explain;\r\n  The horrid apparition still draws nigh,\r\n  And white with foam the whirling surges fly.\"\r\n\r\nThe breeze was now steady, though gentle, and Max and Morton set to work\r\nrigging the sail, which for the last two days had served as an awning.\r\n\r\nDuring our mutual inquiries and explanations, the Frenchman had kept the\r\ncanoe close alongside of us; he now braced round the yard of his\r\ntriangular sail, which had been shaking in the wind, and began to draw\r\nahead.  The young native who had interfered so effectually in Max's\r\nbehalf, observing the eagerness with which we had devoured the doughy\r\nmass of pounded bread-fruit, tossed another cake of the same substance\r\ninto the boat as we separated, which, when distributed, afforded a\r\nmorsel or two to each of us.  I had particularly observed this boy on\r\nthe first approach of the canoe, from the circumstance of his occupying\r\na small raised platform, or dais, of wicker-work, covered with mats.\r\n\r\nAs our sail had been entirely disengaged from the mast and gaff, it was\r\nquite a piece of work to rig it again for service, and by the time this\r\nwas effected, the canoe was some distance ahead of us: though she was\r\nfar better adapted than the yawl for sailing with a light breeze, yet we\r\nnearly held our own with her, after once getting fairly under way.\r\n\r\nWhen the wind first sprang up, the sky had become slightly overcast with\r\nbroken masses of clouds, of a peculiar and unusual appearance.  From the\r\nmost considerable of these masses, radiated, as from a centre, long\r\nlines, like pencils of light, running in straight, regularly diverging\r\nrays, to the ocean.\r\n\r\nWe had been sailing in the wake of the canoe, perhaps half an hour, when\r\nI observed in the south-west a singularly shaped cloud, to which a dark\r\ncolumn, extending downward to the sea, appeared to be attached.  This\r\ncolumn was quite narrow at the base, but enlarged as it rose, until just\r\nbelow the point of union with the cloud, it spread outward like a gothic\r\npillar, diverging into arches as it meets the roof.  I surveyed this\r\nstrange spectacle for several minutes before its true character occurred\r\nto me.  It was already observed by those in the canoe, and from their\r\nexclamations and gestures, they evidently viewed it with apprehension\r\nand dread.\r\n\r\nIt was moving slowly towards us, and we also watched, with feelings in\r\nwhich alarm began to predominate over curiosity and interest, the\r\nmajestic approach of this vast body of water, (as we now perceived it to\r\nbe), held by some secret power suspended between heaven and earth.\r\n\r\n\"It appears to be moving north before the wind,\" said Arthur, at length;\r\n\"if it keeps on its present course, it will pass by, at a safe distance\r\non our left.\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed probable; but we felt disposed to give it a still wider\r\nberth, and shifting the sail, we steered in a north-easterly direction.\r\nScarcely had our sail filled on the new tack, when a cry of terror again\r\ndrew attention to the canoe, and the natives were seen pointing to\r\nanother water-spout, moving slowly round from the east to the north, and\r\nthreatening to intercept us in the course we were pursuing.  This,\r\nunlike the first, was a cylindrical column of water, of about the same\r\ndiameter throughout its entire length, extending in a straight and\r\nunbroken line from the ocean to the heavens.  Its upper extremity was\r\nlost amid a mass of clouds, in which I fancied I could perceive the\r\neffects of the gradual diffusion of the water drawn from the sea, as it\r\nwound its way upward with a rapid spiral motion, and poured into that\r\nelevated reservoir.  As the process went on, the cloud grew darker, and\r\nseemed to stoop with its accumulating weight of waters.\r\n\r\nOur position was fast becoming embarrassing and dangerous.  We had\r\nchanged our course to avoid the first water-spout and now we were\r\nconfronted by another still nearer at hand.\r\n\r\nFor a moment all was confusion, indecision, and dismay.\r\n\r\n\"Quick! round with her head, and let her go right before the wind!\"\r\nshouted Max hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"That would be running directly into the danger,\" cried Morton, \"they\r\nare both moving north, and approaching each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let's pull down the sail, until they are at a safe distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather keep her under headway,\" said Arthur, \"or how could we\r\nescape, if one of them should move down upon us!\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do, then?\" exclaimed Max; \"we can't sail in the teeth of\r\nthe wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am for going about to the left again, and steering as near the wind\r\nas possible,\" said Arthur; \"the one on that side is farthest north.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the course which the natives had already adopted, and they were\r\nnow steering nearly south-west.  We immediately followed their example,\r\nand the fore and aft rig of the yawl enabled us to sail nearer the wind\r\nthan they could do.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the funnel-shaped water-spout, which we had first seen,\r\nhad passed off northward, and was at such a distance as to remove all\r\napprehensions on account of it.  Not so, however, with the second; for\r\nhardly had we tacked again, when, notwithstanding that we were to\r\nwindward of it, it began to move rapidly towards us.\r\n\r\nIts course was not direct and uniform, but it veered now to the right\r\nand now to the left, rendering it difficult for us to decide which way\r\nto steer in order to avoid it.\r\n\r\nArthur sat at the helm, pale, but quite calm and collected, his eyes\r\nsteadfastly fixed on the advancing column, while Johnny crouched at his\r\nside, holding fast one of his hands in both his own.  Morton held the\r\nsheet and stood ready to shift the sail, as the emergency might require.\r\n\r\nOnward it came, towering to the skies, and darkening the ocean with its\r\nimpending bulk; soon we could perceive the powerful agitation of the\r\nwater far around its base, and within the vortex of its influence: a\r\ndense cloud of spray, thrown off in its rapid revolutions, enveloped its\r\nlower extremity: the rushing sound of the water as it was drawn upward,\r\nwas also distinctly audible.  And now it seemed to take a straight\r\ncourse for the canoe.  The natives, with the exception of the boy, threw\r\nthemselves down in the bottom of the boat in abject terror; it was,\r\nindeed, an appalling spectacle, and calculated to shake the stoutest\r\nheart, to see that vast mass of water, enough as it seemed, to swamp the\r\nnavies of the world, suspended so strangely over them.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman appeared to be endeavouring to get the natives to make\r\nsome exertion, but in vain.  He and the boy then seized a couple of\r\npaddles, and made a frantic effort to escape the threatened danger; but\r\nthe whirling pillar was almost upon them, and it seemed as though they\r\nwere devoted to certain destruction.  The Frenchman now threw down his\r\npaddle, and sat with his hands folded on his breast, awaiting his fate.\r\nThe boy, after speaking earnestly to his companion, who merely shook his\r\nhead, stood up in the prow of the canoe, and casting one shuddering look\r\nat the dark column, he joined his hands above his head, and plunged into\r\nthe sea.  In a moment he came to the surface, and struck out vigorously\r\ntowards us.\r\n\r\nThe canoe seemed already within the influence of the water-spout, and\r\nwas drawn towards it with the violently agitated waters around its base.\r\nThe Frenchman, unable longer to endure the awful sight bowed his head\r\nupon his hands; another moment, and he was lost to sight in the circle\r\nof mist and spray that enveloped the foot of the column; then a strong\r\noscillation began to be visible in the body of the water-spout; it\r\nswayed heavily to and fro; the cloud at its apex seemed to stoop, and\r\nthe whole mass broke and fell, with a noise that might have been heard\r\nfor miles.  The sea, far around, was crushed into smoothness by the\r\nshock; immediately where the vast pillar had stood, it boiled like a\r\ncaldron; then a succession of waves, white with foam, came circling\r\noutward from the spot, extending even to us.\r\n\r\nThe native boy, who swam faster than we sailed, was already within forty\r\nor fifty yards of us, and we put about and steered for him: in a moment\r\nhe was alongside, and Arthur, reaching out his hand, helped him into the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nThe sea had now resumed its usual appearance, and every trace of the\r\nwater-spout was gone, so that it was impossible to fix the spot where it\r\nhad broken.  Not a vestige of the canoe, or of her ill-fated company,\r\nwas anywhere to be seen.  We sailed backward and forward in the\r\nneighbourhood of the place, carefully scrutinising the surface in every\r\ndirection, and traversing several times the spot, as nearly as we could\r\ndetermine it, where the canoe had last been seen: but our search was\r\nfruitless: the long billows swelled and subsided with their wonted\r\nregularity, and their rippled summits glittered as brightly in the\r\nsunshine as ever, but they revealed no trace of those whom they had so\r\nsuddenly and remorselessly engulfed.\r\n\r\nThe water-spout which had first been seen, had disappeared, and a few\r\nheavy clouds in the zenith alone remained, as evidences of the terrific\r\nphenomenon which we had just witnessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nOUR ISLAND HOME.\r\n\r\nTHE ILLUSION OF THE GOLDEN HAZE--THE WALL OF BREAKERS--A STRUGGLE FOR\r\nLIFE--THE ISLET OF PALMS.\r\n\r\n  \"Keel never ploughed that lonely sea,\r\n  That isle no human eye hath viewed;\r\n  Around it still in tumult rude,\r\n  The surges everlastingly,\r\n  Burst on the coral-girded shore\r\n  With mighty bound and ceaseless roar;\r\n  A fresh unsullied work of God,\r\n  By human footstep yet untrod.\"\r\n\r\nThe native lad now seemed to be quite overwhelmed with grief.  He had\r\nmade no manifestations of it while we were endeavouring to discover some\r\ntrace of his companions, but when at length we relinquished the attempt,\r\nand it became certain that they had all perished, he uttered a low,\r\nwailing cry, full of distress and anguish, and laying his head upon his\r\nhands, sobbed bitterly.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman had told us that the island lay to the northward; and we\r\nnow put the head of the boat in that direction, steering by the sun,\r\nwhich was just setting.\r\n\r\nWhen the first violence of the boy's grief had somewhat abated, Arthur\r\nspoke to him gently, in the dialect of the Society Islands.  He listened\r\nattentively, turning his large eyes upon Arthur's face with an\r\nexpression of mingled timidity and interest and replied in a low,\r\nmusical voice.  They seemed to understand one another, and talked\r\ntogether for some time.  The language spoken by the boy, differed so\r\nlittle, as Arthur told us, from that of the Tahitians, that he easily\r\ngathered the meaning of what he said.  Upon being questioned as to the\r\ndistance of the island, and the course which we must steer in order to\r\nreach it, he pointed to a bright star, just beginning to be visible in\r\nthe north-east.\r\n\r\nIt is customary with the South-sea Islanders, before setting out on\r\ntheir long voyages, in which it is necessary to venture out of sight of\r\nland, to select some star by which to regulate their course in the\r\nnight-time; this they call the \"aveia,\" or guiding star of the voyage.\r\nThey are thus enabled to sail from island to island, and from group to\r\ngroup, between which all intercourse would otherwise be impossible\r\nwithout a compass.  The star now pointed out to us, had been fixed upon\r\nby the companions of the little islander, at the commencement of their\r\nill-fated voyage, as marking the direction of the home which they were\r\ndestined never to regain.  Among other things, we learned from the boy,\r\nthat his native island, which we were now endeavouring to reach, was the\r\nlargest of a group of three, over all of which his father's authority,\r\nas chief or king, extended: that there were six whites living among\r\nthem, who had arrived there many years before, with the one who had just\r\nperished, and had come from an uninhabited island to the southward, upon\r\nwhich they had been wrecked.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the wind continued fair, and animated by the hopes to\r\nwhich the statements of the little native had given rise, we renewed our\r\nwatch, which had lately been discontinued, and sailed steadily\r\nnorthward, cherishing a strong confidence that we should reach land\r\nbefore morning.\r\n\r\nThe second watch--from a little after midnight to dawn--fell to me.  As\r\nit began to grow light I almost feared to look northward, dreading the\r\nshock of a fresh disappointment, that must consign us again to the\r\nbenumbing apathy from which we had yesterday rallied.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to me to be something unusual in the atmosphere, that\r\nimpeded, or rather confused and bewildered the sight; and when the sun\r\nrose, I had not made out anything like land.  It was not mist or fog,\r\nfor the air was dry, and there were already indications of a fiercely\r\nhot day, though it was yet fresh and cool.  The sky above us, too, was\r\nperfectly clear, all the clouds seemed to have slid down to the horizon,\r\nalong which a white army of them was marshalled, in rounded fleecy\r\nmasses, like Alpine peaks towering one above another, or shining\r\nicebergs, pale and cold as those that drift in Arctic seas.\r\n\r\nOne by one my companions awoke to learn the failure, thus far, of all\r\nthe sanguine expectations of the preceding evening.  The native boy\r\ncould suggest no reason why we had not reached the island, and when\r\nquestioned on the subject, and told that we had steered all through the\r\nnight by the \"aveia,\" he merely shook his head with a bewildered and\r\nhopeless look.  Max, on perceiving that we were still out of sight of\r\nland, threw himself down again in the bottom of the boat without\r\nspeaking a word, where he remained with his eyes closed as if sleeping.\r\n\r\nArthur, after some further conversation with the little islander, came\r\nto the conclusion that in steering due north, we had not made sufficient\r\nallowance for the strong current setting westward; and he proposed that\r\nwe should now sail directly east, to which no objection was made, most\r\nof us having at last come to feel that it could matter little what\r\ncourse we thenceforth steered.  He accordingly took the direction of\r\nthings into his own hands: the wind, which had moderated, was still from\r\nthe west, and he put the boat before it, and lashed the helm.  The\r\npeculiar appearance of the atmosphere still continued.  During the\r\nmorning a number of tropic birds flew by us, the first that we had seen\r\nsince our separation from the ship.  About noon, two noddies alighted on\r\nthe gaff, and the little native climbed the mast after them; but though\r\nthey are generally so tame, or so stupid, as to permit themselves to be\r\napproached and taken with the hand, these flew away before he could\r\nseize them.  We hailed the appearance of these birds as a favourable\r\nomen, neither species being often seen at any considerable distance from\r\nland.  It was, I suppose, about an hour after this, that happening to\r\nlook back, I saw what appeared to be a high island, covered with tall\r\ngroves of palms, some two miles distant.  The elevated shores, and the\r\ngreen tops of the trees, were plainly visible; but just at the point\r\nwhere land and water met, there was a kind of hazy indistinctness in the\r\nview.  We were sailing directly from it, and I could not understand how\r\nwe had passed as near as we must have done, without observing it.\r\nBrowne, catching sight of it almost at the same time with myself,\r\nuttered an exclamation that quickly aroused the attention of the rest,\r\nand we all stood for a moment gazing, half incredulously, upon the land\r\nwhich seemed to have started up so suddenly out of the sea, in the very\r\ntrack which we had just passed over.\r\n\r\nArthur alone, appeared to be but little moved; he looked long and\r\nintently, without uttering a word.\r\n\r\n\"This is singular--very singular!\" said Morton.  \"It seems as though we\r\nmust have sailed over the _very_ spot where it lies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless I am mistaken,\" said Arthur, \"we have been going backward for\r\nsome time past: we must be in a very powerful current, which is carrying\r\nus in a direction contrary to that in which we are heading: the wind is\r\nso light that this is not impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you are right,\" said Morton, \"I can account for it in no\r\nother way.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had better then pull down the sail, and take the benefit of the full\r\nforce of the current,\" resumed Arthur: this was accordingly done, and\r\nthe mast unstepped.\r\n\r\nA short time passed, during which we appeared to be steadily drawing\r\nnearer to the land.  The shore itself where it emerged from the ocean,\r\nwe could not see with perfect distinctness: a fine, golden haze, like a\r\nvisible atmosphere, waved and quivered before it, half veiling it from\r\nsight, and imparting to it an uncertain, though bright and dazzling\r\naspect: but this appearance was confined to the lower part of the land;\r\nthe bold shores and high groves were clearly defined.\r\n\r\n\"I trust we are not the subjects of some fearful illusion,\" said Browne,\r\nbreaking a long silence, during which all eyes had been rivetted upon\r\nthe island; \"but there is something very strange about all this--it has\r\nan unearthly look.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the bright haze which floated over the sea near the\r\nsurface, began to extend itself upward, and to grow denser and more\r\nimpervious to the sight: the wooded shores became indistinct and dim,\r\nand seemed gradually receding in the distance, until the whole island,\r\nwith its bold heights and waving groves, dissolved and melted away like\r\na beautiful vision.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" exclaimed Browne, in a voice of horror.  \"I should\r\nthink, if I believed such things permitted, that evil spirits had power\r\nhere on the lonely sea, and were sporting with our misery.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a mirage,\" said Arthur quietly, \"as I suspected from the first.\r\nBut courage! though what we have seen was an optical illusion, there\r\nmust be a real island in the distance beyond, of which this was the\r\nelevated and refracted image.  It cannot, I think, be more than thirty\r\nor forty miles off, and the current is sweeping us steadily towards it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose then,\" said Morton, \"that we can do nothing better, than to\r\ntrust ourselves entirely to this current which must in fact be a pretty\r\npowerful one--at least as rapid as the Gulf Stream.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can do nothing better until the wind changes,\" replied Arthur,\r\ncheerfully; \"at present I am disposed to think we are doing very well,\r\nand fast approaching land.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was no change of the wind, and we continued hour after hour,\r\napparently making no progress, but in reality, as we believed, drifting\r\nsteadily westward.  All through the day we maintained a vigilant watch,\r\nlest by any possibility we should miss sight of the island which Arthur\r\nwas so confident we were approaching.  Late in the afternoon we saw a\r\nflock of gannets, and some sooty tern; the gannets passing so near that\r\nwe could hear the motion of their long twisted wings.  Later still, a\r\nnumber of small reef-birds passed over head; all were flying westward.\r\nThis confirmed Arthur in his belief of the proximity of land.  \"See,\"\r\nsaid he, \"these little reef-birds are bound in the same direction with\r\nthe others, and with ourselves; you may depend upon it, that the\r\nsea-fowl we have seen, are hastening homeward to their nests, on some\r\nnot far distant shore.\"\r\n\r\nSo fully did I share this confidence, that I commenced a calculation as\r\nto the time at which we might expect to reach land.  Assuming it to have\r\nbeen thirty miles distant at the time when we had seen its spectrum, by\r\nmeans of the refraction, arising from a peculiar state of the\r\natmosphere; and estimating the rate of the current at three miles an\r\nhour, I came to the conclusion that we could not even come in sight of\r\nit until late at night; and it was therefore without any strong feeling\r\nof disappointment, that I saw the day fast drawing to a close, and\r\nnothing but sky and ocean yet visible.\r\n\r\nThe sun had already set, but the long tract of crimson and\r\nflame-coloured clouds that glowed in the horizon where he had\r\ndisappeared, still reflected light enough to render it easy to\r\ndistinguish objects in that quarter, when I was startled by a cry of\r\njoyful surprise from the native boy, who, shading his eyes with his\r\nhands, was looking intently westward.  After a long and earnest gaze, he\r\nspoke eagerly to Arthur, who told us that the boy thought he saw his\r\nnative island.  Looking in the same direction, I could make out nothing.\r\nArthur and Browne spoke of a brilliantly white line, narrow, but\r\nwell-defined against the horizon, as being all that they could see.\r\nMorton, who was very keen-sighted, thought that he distinguished some\r\ndark object beyond the low white band seen by the others.  As the light\r\ngradually failed, we lost sight of this appearance.  It was some hours\r\nbefore the rising of the moon, which we awaited with anxiety.  She was\r\nnow at her full, and when at length she came up out of the sea, her\r\ndisc, broad and red like a beamless sun, seemed to rest, dilated to\r\npreternatural size, upon the edge of the last wave that swelled against\r\nthe horizon.  As she ascended the sky, she shed over the ocean a flood\r\nof silvery light, less glaring, but almost as bright as that of day.\r\nThe wonderful brilliancy of the moon and stars within the tropics, is\r\none of the first things noted by the voyager.  It may be owing to the\r\ngreat clearness and transparency of the atmosphere: but whatever the\r\ncause, their light is much more powerful than in higher latitudes, and\r\nthey seem actually nearer, and of greater magnitude.\r\n\r\nWe now looked eagerly westward again; the snow-white line, of which the\r\nothers had spoken, was by this time distinctly visible to me also, and\r\nbeyond it, too plainly relieved against the clear blue of the sky, to\r\nadmit of doubt or illusion, were the high outlines of a tropical island,\r\nclothed with verdure to its summit.\r\n\r\nAgain the little islander shouted joyously, and clasped his hands, while\r\nthe tears streamed down his olive cheeks.\r\n\r\nHe recognised his native island, the smallest and most easterly of the\r\nthree, of which his father was the chief.  We should soon come in sight\r\nof the remaining two, he said, which were lower, and lay to the north\r\nand south of it; he explained that the appearance, like a low white line\r\nrunning along the base of the island, was caused by the surf, bursting\r\nupon a coral reef about a mile from the shore.\r\n\r\nHere then, at last, was the land which we had at one time despaired of\r\never beholding again, and now we were well assured that it was no airy\r\nphantasm; yet strange as it may seem, our feelings were not those of\r\nunmingled joy.\r\n\r\nA thousand vague apprehensions and surmises of evil, began to suggest\r\nthemselves, as we approached this unknown shore, inhabited by savages,\r\nand under the dominion of a savage.  We doubted not that we might depend\r\nupon the good-will, and friendly offices of the little native, but we\r\nfelt at the same time, that the influence of one so young, might prove\r\ninsufficient for our protection.\r\n\r\nWe were in some measure acquainted with the savage customs, the dark and\r\ncruel rites, that prevailed among the Polynesian races generally, and\r\nhad often listened with horror, to the recital of what Arthur and his\r\nuncle had themselves seen, of their bloody superstitions, and abominable\r\npractices.  As I looked into the faces of my companions, it was easy to\r\nperceive that they were possessed by anxious and gloomy thoughts.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the current continued to sweep us steadily onward toward the\r\nshore, the outlines of which became every moment more distinct.\r\nOccasionally a cloud drifted athwart the moon, and cast a soft shade\r\nupon the sea, obscuring the view for a time; but when it had passed, the\r\nland seemed to have drawn perceptibly nearer during the interval.  At\r\nlength, when the night was far advanced, and the island was right before\r\nus, at the distance of scarcely a mile, the native lad, who had been\r\ngazing wistfully toward it for the last half-hour, uttered a plaintive\r\ncry of disappointment.  He had looked long and anxiously, for the\r\nappearance of the two remaining islands of his father's group, but in\r\nvain; and now he yielded reluctantly to the conviction, that he had been\r\ndeceived by the white line of surf, similar to that which bounded on one\r\nside his native island, and that he had never before seen the one which\r\nwe were approaching.  This discovery was a relief to me, and removed a\r\nweight of apprehension from my mind.  The thought of being cast upon a\r\ndesert and uninhabited shore, seemed less dreadful, than that of falling\r\ninto the power of a tribe of savage islanders, even under circumstances\r\nwhich would probably secure us a friendly reception.\r\n\r\nBut now a strange and unforeseen difficulty presented itself.  Between\r\nus and the island, stretched a barrier reef, running north and south,\r\nand curving westward; and appearing, as far as we could see, completely\r\nto surround it.  Along the whole line of this reef the sea was breaking\r\nwith such violence as to render all approach dangerous; neither could we\r\nespy any break or opening in it, through which to reach the shore.\r\nTowards this foaming barrier the current was rapidly bearing us, and we\r\nwere too feeble to struggle long against its force.  To permit ourselves\r\nto be carried upon the reef would be certain destruction, and our only\r\nhope of safety seemed to lie in discovering some inlet through it.  Our\r\ntrue situation flashed upon me all at once; I had not before thought of\r\nthe impossibility of receding.  Glancing at Arthur, I caught his eye,\r\nand saw that he comprehended the full extent of the danger.  \"We are\r\nnear enough to see any break in the reef,\" said he, \"let us now take to\r\nthe oars, and coast along it in search of one.\"\r\n\r\nThis was accordingly done.  But it was not until we had pulled along the\r\nshore for some time, and found that in spite of our endeavours to\r\npreserve our distance from it, we were steadily forced nearer, that the\r\nrest seemed aware of the imminence of the danger.\r\n\r\n\"The current is carrying us among the breakers,\" exclaimed Morton, at\r\nlength, \"though we are heading rather away from the shore, we are\r\ngetting closer every moment.\"  This appalling fact was now apparent to\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"The wind seems to have died away,\" said Browne, \"at any rate there is\r\nnot enough of it to help us: we must put about and pull out of the reach\r\nof this surf, or we are lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long do you suppose we can continue that?\" said Arthur.  \"No, our\r\nonly hope is in finding an entrance through the reef, and that\r\nspeedily.\"\r\n\r\nWe now steered a little farther away, and strained at the oars, as those\r\nwho struggle for life.  Occasionally, when lifted on the crest of a\r\nwave, we caught a transient glimpse of a smooth expanse of water beyond\r\nthe foaming line of surf, and extending from the inner edge of the reef,\r\nto the shore of the island.  The tall tops of the palms bordering the\r\nbeach, seemed scarcely a stone's throw distant and you could fancy that,\r\nbut for the roar of the breakers, you might hear the rustling of their\r\nlong, drooping leaves; but it only added to the horror of our situation,\r\nto see that safe and peaceful haven, so near, yet so inaccessible.\r\n\r\nIn some places the reef rose quite out of the water; in others, it was,\r\nin nautical phrase, \"all awash;\" but nowhere could we attempt a landing\r\nwith safety.  All the while, too, it was evident that in spite of our\r\ndesperate exertions, we were being driven nearer and nearer the\r\nbreakers.  This kind of work had continued almost an hour, when our\r\nstrength began to fail.\r\n\r\n\"There appears to be no use in this, comrades,\" said Browne, at last;\r\n\"had we not better just let her go upon the reef, and take our chance of\r\nbeing able to get to the shore?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no!\" exclaimed Arthur, earnestly, \"that is too desperate.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be so completely exhausted that we shan't be able to make an\r\neffort for our lives, when at last we are carried into the surf,\"\r\nanswered Browne, \"and we must come to that sooner or later.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not--there is reason to hope not,\" rejoined Arthur, \"but if so,\r\nwe may as well be exhausted, as fresh; no strength will be of any avail;\r\nwe shall be crushed and mangled upon the rocks; or if by any possibility\r\nsome of us should reach the shore, what is to become of our poor, sick\r\nJohnny?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will look after him,\" said Browne, \"I will pledge myself that he\r\nshan't be lost, unless I am too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us hold out a few moments yet,\" implored Arthur; \"I will take your\r\noar; you are the only one who has not been relieved.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Browne, \"you had better keep the helm; I can stand it a while\r\nlonger, and I will pull until we are swept upon the reef; if you all\r\nthink that the best plan.\"\r\n\r\nIt was barely possible that if we should now act as Browne proposed, we\r\nmight be carried clear off the reef into the lagoon beyond, for we were\r\nopposite a sunken patch, upon which there was more water than at other\r\nplaces.  Failing of this, the boat would inevitably be dashed to pieces;\r\nbut still, if not bruised and disabled among the rocks, or carried back\r\nby the return waves, we might be able to reach the smooth water inside\r\nthe reef, when it would be easy to swim ashore.\r\n\r\nBut to most of us, the attempt seemed too desperate to be thought of,\r\nexcept as a last resort; and we preferred to toil at the oars as long as\r\nour strength should last in the hope of discovering an inlet.  Arthur,\r\non whose skill and judgment we all relied, steered still farther out,\r\nand for a while we seemed to make head against the swell and the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nFor full half an hour longer, we kept up this severe struggle, that\r\nadmitted not of an instant's pause or respite.  But then our progress\r\nbecame almost imperceptible, and every stroke was made more feebly and\r\nlaboriously than the last.  I could hardly hold the oar in my stiffened\r\nfingers.  Still no break was to be seen in the long line of surf which\r\nseemed to hem in the island, extending like a white wall, of uniform\r\nheight, far as the eye could reach, on either hand.  I had read of\r\nislands, like that of Eimeo, completely encircled by coral reefs, with\r\nbut a single gateway by which they were accessible.  What if this were\r\nsuch an one, and the only entrance, miles from the spot where we were\r\ntoiling for our lives!  The conviction that we must risk the chance of\r\nsuccess in an attempt to land upon some ledge of the reef, was forcing\r\nitself upon all our minds, when Max, trembling with eagerness, pointed\r\nto what appeared to be an opening through the surf, nearly opposite us;\r\nthere was a narrow space where the long waves, as they rolled towards\r\nthe shore, did not seem to encounter the obstacle over which they broke\r\nwith such violence on both sides of it, and the swell of the ocean met\r\nthe placid waters of the lagoon, without any intervening barrier.\r\nThrough this gap, the shore of the island could be seen, down to the\r\nwater's edge.\r\n\r\nArthur hastily made a bundle of the mast and gaff, and placing it within\r\nJohnny's reach, told him to cling to it, in case of accident.  Then,\r\ncalling upon us to pull steadily, he steered directly for the inlet.  As\r\nwe neared it the noise of the surf became almost deafening: the huge\r\nrollers, as they thundered against the perpendicular wall of coral,\r\nrising abruptly from the depths of the sea, sent up a column of foam and\r\nspray, twelve or fifteen feet into the air.  When just within the\r\nentrance, the spectacle was grand and appalling.  But the danger, real\r\nor apparent, was soon over: with a firm hand, and steady eye, Arthur\r\nguided the boat along the centre of the narrow pass, and in a moment we\r\nhad glided from the scene of fierce commotion without the reef, into one\r\nof perfect tranquillity and repose.  A dozen strokes seemed to have\r\nplaced us in a new world.  Involuntarily we rested on our oars, and\r\ngazed around us in silence.\r\n\r\nFrom the inner edge of the reef, to the broad white beach of the island,\r\na space of perhaps half a mile, spread the clear expanse of the lagoon,\r\nsmooth and unruffled as the surface of an inland lake.  Half-way between\r\nthe reef and the shore, were two fairy islets, the one scarcely a foot\r\nabove the water, and covered with a green mantle of low shrubs; the\r\nother, larger and higher, and adorned by a group of graceful young\r\ncocoa-nuts.\r\n\r\nThe island itself was higher, and bolder in its outlines than is usual\r\nwith those of coral formation, which are generally very low, and without\r\nany diversity of surface.  Dense groves clothed that portion of it\r\nopposite to us, nearly to the beach, giving it at that hour, a somewhat\r\ngloomy and forbidding aspect.\r\n\r\nAs we surveyed this lovely, but silent and desolate landscape, the\r\ndoubts and apprehensions which we had before experienced began once more\r\nto suggest themselves; but they were dissipated by the cheerful voice of\r\nArthur, calling upon us to pull for the shore.  He steered for the\r\nlarger of the two islets, and when, as the boat grated upon the coral\r\ntops beside it, we threw down the oars, the strength which had hitherto\r\nsustained us, seemed suddenly to fail, and we could scarcely crawl\r\nashore.  The last scene of effort and danger, had taxed our powers to\r\nthe uttermost, and now they gave way.  I was so feeble, that I could\r\nhardly avoid sinking helplessly upon the sand.  With one impulse we\r\nkneeled down and returned thanks to Him Who had preserved us through all\r\nthe strange vicissitudes of the last few days.  We next began to look\r\nround in search of such means of refreshment as the spot might afford.\r\n\r\nThe cocoa-palms upon the islet, though far from having attained their\r\nfull growth, (few of them exceeding twelve feet in height), bore\r\nabundantly, and we easily procured as much of the fruit as we needed.\r\nTearing off the outer husk, and punching a hole through the shell, which\r\nin the young nut is so soft that this can be done with the finger, we\r\ndrank off the refreshing liquor with which it is filled; then breaking\r\nit open, the half-formed, jelly-like kernel, furnished a species of food\r\nmost nutritious and agreeable, and probably the best adapted to our\r\nhalf-famished condition.\r\n\r\nHunger and thirst being appeased, our next care was to make some\r\narrangement for passing the night more comfortably than could be done in\r\nthe boat.  Selecting a clear space in the centre of the group of young\r\ncocoa-nuts, we proceeded to make a rude tent, by fixing two of the oars\r\nupright in the ground,--tying the mast across their tops and throwing\r\nthe sail over it, the ends being then fastened to the ground at a\r\nconvenient distance on each side.\r\n\r\nFinding that the bare ground would make a rather hard couch, though far\r\nless so than we had lately been accustomed to, Morton proposed that we\r\nshould bring a load of leaves from the neighbouring shore to spread upon\r\nit.  He and I accordingly rowed over to the mainland, and collected in\r\nthe grove near the beech, a boatload of the clean dry foliage of the\r\npandanus and hibiscus, which made excellent elastic beds.  Johnny\r\nwatched our departure as though he considered this an exceedingly rash\r\nand adventurous enterprise, and he seemed greatly relieved at our safe\r\nreturn.  It was now past midnight, and after hauling the boat well up on\r\nthe shore, we laid down side by side and were very soon asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE EXPLORING EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nEIULO--PEARL-SHELL BEACH--A WARLIKE COLONY--AN INVASION REPELLED.\r\n\r\n  \"They linger there while weeks and months go by,\r\n  And hold their hope, tho' weeks and months are past;\r\n  And still at morning round the farthest sky,\r\n  And still at eve, their eager glance is cast,\r\n  If there they may behold the far-off mast\r\n  Arise, for which they have not ceased to pray.\"\r\n\r\nFor a number of days we remained upon the islet where we had first\r\nlanded, seldom visiting even the adjacent shore.  During this time we\r\nsubsisted upon cocoa-nuts and a small species of shell-fish, resembling\r\nmussels, which we obtained in abundance from the ledges of the\r\nneighbouring reef, and which the little native told us, were used as a\r\ncommon article of food among his own people.  We had reason to feel\r\ngrateful that, while we were as feeble and incapable of exertion as we\r\nfound ourselves for some days, food could be so readily procured.  It\r\nwas also fortunate that during this period the weather continued\r\nremarkably fine and mild, with no perceptible variations of temperature;\r\nfor I have little doubt that in the reduced and exhausted condition in\r\nwhich we then were, and being without any effectual shelter, two or\r\nthree days of bad weather would have cost some of us our lives.  The\r\nnights were dry and mild, and no dew seemed to fall upon the islet:\r\nthanks to this genial weather, and to abundance of nourishing food, we\r\nbegan rapidly to recover strength.\r\n\r\nSome time passed before we thought of making any attempt to penetrate or\r\nexplore the island.  We were, naturally, very reluctant to admit even to\r\nourselves, the probability that our stay upon it was to be of any long\r\nduration; and we did not therefore feel as much interest in its\r\ncharacter and resources as we should otherwise have done.  All our\r\nthoughts and hopes ran in one channel.  We looked for the coming of a\r\nship to rescue us from our dreary position; and every morning and\r\nevening, at least, and generally many times a day, some one of us\r\nclimbed into the tuft of an inclining palm, to take a careful survey of\r\nthat portion of the ocean, which could be seen from our side of the\r\nisland.  The thought of acting in any respect as though the lonely spot\r\nwhere we now found ourselves was destined to be our permanent abode, was\r\nin fact too painful and repugnant to our feelings to be willingly\r\nentertained; we were content therefore, to provide for our daily wants\r\nas they arose, without anticipating or preparing for the future.\r\n\r\nA few days passed in this unvaried and monotonous routine, seemed in\r\nreality a long period; recent occurrences began to assume the vagueness\r\nof things that had happened years ago.  I remember particularly, that,\r\nin looking back at the dreadful scenes of the mutiny, and our subsequent\r\nsufferings at sea, the whole seemed unreal, and more like a horrible\r\ndream, than an actual part of our past experience.\r\n\r\nWe soon found that this inert and aimless mode of living--this state of\r\npassive expectation, while awaiting the occurrence of an event which we\r\ncould do nothing to procure or hasten, was a most miserable one: though\r\nour physical strength was in a great measure recruited, there was no\r\nincrease of cheerfulness.  Except when engaged in procuring food, or\r\nmaking our daily surveys of the ocean, (which was all our occupation),\r\nwe were dispirited and listless.\r\n\r\nArthur perceived the evil of this state of things, and set himself to\r\ndevising a remedy.\r\n\r\nWe had been at the island about two weeks, when he proposed, one\r\nmorning, that we should go over to the mainland and commence a search\r\nfor water, making an excursion a little way into the interior, if it\r\nshould prove necessary.\r\n\r\nMax objected to this, saying that we had no need of water, since we\r\ncould, without doubt, obtain cocoa-nut milk as long as we should be\r\nobliged to remain upon the island, and that by going into the interior,\r\nout of sight of the ocean, we might lose an opportunity of being\r\nrescued.\r\n\r\nTo this, Arthur replied, that the exclusive use of cocoa-nut milk was\r\nconsidered very unwholesome, and was supposed to be the cause of certain\r\ndropsical complaints, common among the natives of many of the Pacific\r\nislands; that beside; it was by no means certain that a supply of it\r\ncould be obtained throughout the year.  He finally suggested the\r\npossibility that our stay on the island might be longer than we\r\nanticipated, in which case its resources, and the means of subsistence\r\nwhich it afforded, would be matters of great interest to us.  In regard\r\nto the danger which Max seemed chiefly to fear, he said that we should\r\nseldom altogether lose sight of the ocean, but might, on the contrary,\r\nobtain a wider view of it from other parts of the island.  I warmly\r\nseconded Arthur's proposal, for I perceived the probable beneficial\r\neffects of effort, or occupation, of almost any kind.  Morton also was\r\ndecidedly in favour of it; and Johnny, who had recovered strength and\r\nspirits wonderfully within the last few days, was quite enthusiastic for\r\nthe excursion.  He calculated confidently upon our discovering a creek\r\nof fresh water, full of fishes and lobsters, and cited the history of\r\nthe Swiss family Robinson, in support of the reasonableness of these\r\nexpectations; declaring that for us part, he could not see why we might\r\nnot count upon equal good fortune with them.  Browne seemed indifferent\r\nabout the matter.  The little native, (whose name, upon Arthur's\r\nauthority, I shall write \"Eiulo,\" though \"Iooloo,\" comes nearer to the\r\nsound, as he himself pronounced it), shared in Johnny's delight in\r\nprospect of the expedition; indeed, the two had already become the best\r\nfriends in the world, notwithstanding the difficulty of communicating\r\nwith one another, and seemed to harmonise in every thing.  The excursion\r\nwas accordingly determined upon, and this being so, there was nothing to\r\nprevent our setting out at once.\r\n\r\nMorton proposed that, instead of undertaking to penetrate into the\r\ninterior, we should keep along the shore to the northward, as by that\r\nmeans some idea might be gained of the extent of the island; and since\r\nany considerable spring or stream must find its way to the sea, we\r\nshould also be more likely to discover water, than by pursuing the other\r\ncourse.  Along the southern shore, the land was lower and less uneven\r\nthan in the opposite direction, and held forth a slighter prospect of\r\nsprings or streams.  The difficulty of holding a straight course through\r\nthe forest, where we should be without any means of ascertaining the\r\npoints of the compass, was a consideration of great weight, and Morton's\r\nplan was at last adopted, as being upon the whole the best.\r\n\r\nThe sun was not more than half an hour high, when we pushed off from the\r\nshore of the islet, and rowed over towards the mainland.  The morning\r\nwas fine and clear, and either the fresh, bracing sea-air, or the stir\r\nand excitement of setting out upon our expedition, had an exhilarating\r\ninfluence, for we gradually became quite cheerful, and even animated;\r\nand the faces of my companions began to brighten up with more of the old\r\nfamiliar expression, than I had seen there for many a day.\r\n\r\nThe merest breath of a breeze just stirred the crisp leaves of the palms\r\nupon the neighbouring shore; the tiny wavelets rippled softly upon the\r\nsnowy, shell-spangled beach, or, out in the lagoon, danced and sparkled\r\nin the sunlight; still further out and just beyond the barrier that\r\nfenced in this quiet and secluded scene from the open ocean, we could\r\nsee the huge blue rollers with their foaming crests surging high into\r\nthe air; and the heavy booming of the surf, as it thundered upon the\r\nreef, might be heard for miles around, amid the prevailing silence.\r\nBeyond this again, stretched away to the horizon, the blue, swelling\r\narch of the ocean--a clear, deep, intense blue, contrasting beautifully\r\nwith the paler blue of the sky, against which it was relieved, and with\r\nthe emerald expanse of the lagoon.\r\n\r\nBrowne gazed about him with more interest than I had yet seen him\r\nmanifest in any thing since we had reached the island.  He inhaled the\r\nfresh morning air with the appearance of actual relish and enjoyment and\r\nat last, to my surprise, (for Max had accused him, not without some\r\nreason, of having been the most lugubrious of our party), he began to\r\nsing to a brisk and cheerful tune--\r\n\r\n  \"O, happy days of hope and rest\r\n  Shall dawn on sorrow's dreary night,\r\n  Though grief may be an evening guest,\r\n  Yet joy shall come with morning light!\r\n  The light of smiles shall beam again,\r\n  From lids that now o'erflow with tears,\r\n  And weary hours of woe and pain,\r\n  Are earnests of serener years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, as he finished his song, \"this may be a desert island,\r\nbut I will defy any one to gainsay that the morning is delicious, and\r\nthe scene a right lovely one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you begin to wake up to it,\" said Morton, \"it looks very much\r\nas it has at this hour for ten days past.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" protested Browne, \"this bright, clear atmosphere makes a very\r\ngreat difference in the appearance of things: we have had no such\r\nmornings as this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you could manage to enjoy it,\" said Max, \"without missing every\r\nother stroke, and digging me so unmercifully in the back with your\r\noar-handle; if you can't, I must ask you to change seats with me, and\r\nlet me take the bow-oar.\"\r\n\r\n\"How natural and refreshing that sounds!\" cried Morton, laughing; \"it is\r\na sure token that prospects are brightening, and serious dangers are\r\nover, when we find ourselves again in a condition to scold about\r\ntrifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't such a trifle, to be thumped and mauled with the butt of an\r\noar, as I have been all the while Browne was singing, and rhapsodising,\r\nand going into ecstasies about the beauty of the morning; which is just\r\nsuch another as we have had ever since we have been here; all the\r\ndifference being in his feelings, which happen to be a shade or two less\r\ndoleful than usual, and so cause things to look brighter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you would have me believe,\" answered Browne, \"that the sun will\r\ninvariably shine when I chance to be in good spirits, and that a\r\nthunder-storm would be the natural consequence of my having a fit of the\r\nblues?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be sorry if that were the case,\" replied Max, \"as we should\r\nthen be sure to have a large average of bad weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"This excursion reminds me of our school-days,\" said Arthur; \"it almost\r\nseems as though we were once more starting off together, on one of our\r\nSaturday rambles, as we have so often done on fine summer and autumn\r\nmornings at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I shall never forget those forays through the woods,\" said\r\nMorton, \"over hill and hollow, in search of nuts, or berries, or\r\nwild-grapes, or meadow-plums--the fishing and swimming in summer, the\r\nsnow-balling, and sledding, and skating, in winter! an innocent and\r\nhappy set of urchins we were then!\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Max, laughing, \"to hear you one would suppose that we\r\nwere now a conclave of venerable, grey-haired sages, scarcely able to\r\nremember the time when we were children, and so full of wisdom and\r\nexperience, that we had long ago ceased to be `innocent and happy.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Without professing to be so wise or experienced, as to be very unhappy\r\non that account,\" returned Morton, \"I suppose I may say that I am old\r\nenough, and sufficiently changed since those days, to feel, as I now\r\nlook back upon them with a sigh, their peculiar happiness, so unlike any\r\nthing that after-life affords.\"\r\n\r\n\"How singular it is,\" said Browne, \"that you four who were playmates\r\nwhen children, should have happened to keep together so long.\"\r\n\r\n\"And still find ourselves together on an island in the Pacific Ocean,\r\nthousands of miles from home,\" added Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"After quitting school,\" continued Browne, \"I never met with any of my\r\ncomrades there.  Of all the mates with whom I used on the Saturday\r\nhalf-holydays, to go gathering hips and haws, or angling in the Clyde, I\r\nhave not since come in contact with one.\"\r\n\r\n\"It don't seem at all like Saturday to me,\" said Johnny, who for some\r\nminutes past had appeared to have something on his mind, as to the\r\nexpediency of communicating which he was undecided; \"I was afraid that\r\nit was Sunday, every thing is so still; but I hope it is not, for Arthur\r\nwould not think it right to start upon an exploring expedition on\r\nSunday, and so it would be put off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" said Browne, \"that is extremely flattering to the rest of us.\r\nDo you think we are all heathens, except Arthur?  I, for one, have no\r\nnotion of becoming a savage, because I am on a desert island; I shall go\r\nfor maintaining the decencies of Christianity and civilisation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does any one know what day it really is?\" inquired Morton.\r\n\r\nMax said he believed it was Monday.  Arthur thought it was Wednesday,\r\nand added that he had memoranda, from which he had no doubt he could fix\r\nthe day with certainty.\r\n\r\n\"It was on Friday,\" said Max, \"that the mutiny took place, and that we\r\ngot to sea in the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Arthur, \"and it was on Wednesday night, I think, five days\r\nafterwards, that we landed here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five days!\" cried Max.  \"Do you mean to say that we were but five days\r\nat sea before reaching the island?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that is all,\" replied Arthur, \"though the time certainly seems\r\nmuch longer.  Then, if my calculations are correct, we have been here\r\njust two weeks to-day, so that this is Wednesday.  But,\" continued he,\r\n\"as our heavenly Father has thus guided our little bark safe through\r\nthis wilderness of waters, let us celebrate the day of our landing on\r\nthis `Canaan,' by making it our first Sabbath, and our grateful voices\r\nshall every seventh day, from this, be lifted up in praise and\r\nthanksgiving for the mercy thus vouchsafed to us.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was going on, we reached the shore.  Johnny\r\nscrambled eagerly to the bow, anxious to be the first to land, and he\r\nattained this object of his ambition, by jumping into the water nearly\r\nup to his waist, before the boat was fairly beached.  Then, after gazing\r\naround him a moment with exclamations of wonder and admiration, he\r\nsuddenly commenced running up and down the wide, firm beach, gathering\r\nshells, with as much zeal and earnestness, as though he was spending a\r\nholiday by the sea-side at home, and could tie up these pretty\r\ncuriosities in his handkerchief, and run back with them in five minutes\r\nto his father's house.  There was certainly some ground for Johnny's\r\nadmiration; just at the spot where we had landed, the shore was thickly\r\nstrewn, in a manner which I had never before seen equalled, with\r\nvarieties of the most curious and beautiful shells.  They were of all\r\nsizes, and of every conceivable shape and colour.  The surfaces of some\r\nwere smooth and highly polished; others were scolloped, or fluted, or\r\nmarked with wave-like undulations.  There were little rice and cowrie\r\nshells; mottled tiger shells; spider shells, with their long, sharp\r\nspikes; immense conches, rough, and covered with great knobs on the\r\noutside, but smooth and rose-lipped within, and of many delicate hues.\r\nThere were some that resembled gigantic snail shells, and others shaped\r\nlike the cornucopias, used to hold sugar-plums for children.  One\r\nspecies, the most remarkable of all, was composed of a substance,\r\nresembling mother-of-pearl, exquisitely beautiful, but very fragile,\r\nbreaking easily, if you but set foot on one of them: they were\r\nchangeable in colour, being of a dazzling white, a pearly blue, or a\r\ndelicate pale green, as viewed in different lights.  Scattered here and\r\nthere, among these deserted tenements of various kinds of shell-fish,\r\nwere the beautiful exuviae and skeletons of star-fish, and sea-eggs;\r\nwhile in the shallow water, numerous living specimens could be seen\r\nmoving lazily about.  Among these last, I noticed a couple of\r\nsea-porcupines, bristling with their long, fine, flexible quills, and an\r\nenormous conch crawling along the bottom with his house on his back, the\r\nlocomotive power being entirely out of sight.\r\n\r\nJohnny seemed for the moment to have forgotten every thing else, in the\r\ncontemplation of these treasures; and it was not until Arthur reminded\r\nhim that there was no one to remove or appropriate them, and that he\r\ncould get as many as he wanted at any time, that he desisted from his\r\nwork, and reluctantly consented to postpone making a collection for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nHaving drawn the boat high up on the beach, and armed ourselves with a\r\ncutlass apiece, (Johnny taking possession of the longest one of the\r\nlot), we commenced our march along the shore, to the right, without\r\nfurther delay.\r\n\r\nWe had by this time scarcely a remaining doubt that the island was\r\nuninhabited.  No palm-thatched huts occupied the open spaces, or crowned\r\nthe little eminences that diversified its windward side; no wreaths of\r\nsmoke could be seen rising above the tops of the groves; no canoes, full\r\nof tattooed savages, glided over the still waters within the reef; and\r\nno merry troops of bathers pursued their sports in the surf.  There was\r\nnothing to impart life and animation to the scene, but the varied\r\nevolutions of the myriads of sea-fowl, continually swooping, and\r\nscreaming around us.  With this exception, a silence like that of the\r\nfirst Sabbath brooded over the island, which appeared as fresh, and as\r\nfree from every trace of the presence of man, as if it had newly sprung\r\ninto existence.\r\n\r\nWith the continued absence of every indication of inhabitants our\r\nfeeling of security had increased to such an extent, that even Johnny\r\nventured sometimes to straggle behind, or to run on before, and\r\noccasionally made a hasty incursion into the borders of the grove,\r\nthough he took care never to be far out of sight or hearing of the main\r\nbody.  Soon after starting, we doubled a projecting promontory, and lost\r\nsight of the boat and the islet.  The reef bent round to the north,\r\npreserving nearly a uniform distance from the shore, and was without any\r\nbreak or opening.\r\n\r\nThe forest in most places, extended nearly to the beach, and was\r\ncomposed chiefly of hibiscus, pandanus, and cocoa-nut trees, with here\r\nand there a large pisonia, close to the lagoon.  One gigantic specimen\r\nof this last species, which we stopped a moment to admire, could not\r\nhave been less than twenty feet in girth.  Max, Morton, Arthur, and\r\nmyself, could not quite span it, taking hold of hands, and Johnny had to\r\njoin the ring, to make it complete.  For several hours we continued our\r\njourney pretty steadily, encountering no living thing, except tern,\r\ngannets, and other sea-birds, and one troop of gaudy little paroquets,\r\nglittering in green, and orange, and crimson.  These paroquets were the\r\nonly land-birds we saw during the day.  Max pronounced them \"frights,\"\r\nbecause of their large hooked bills, and harsh discordant cries.  They\r\ncertainly gave Johnny, a terrible \"fright,\" and indeed startled us all a\r\nlittle, by suddenly taking wing, with loud, hoarse screams, from a\r\nhibiscus, beneath which we were resting, without having observed that\r\nthey were perched over our heads.\r\n\r\nWhen it was near noon, and we had travelled, as we supposed, making\r\nallowance for delays and deviations, some six or eight miles, the\r\ncharacter of the shore suddenly changed.  The white, shelving beach, and\r\nthe dense groves meeting it near the water, now disappeared, and were\r\nsucceeded by an open strip of land, bordering the lagoon, strewed with\r\nhuge, irregular fragments of coral rock, and seamed with gullies.  The\r\nline of the forest here receded some distance from the shore, leaving a\r\nbroad rounded point, embracing a large area of low and barren ground,\r\ncovered thinly with a growth of stunted shrubs, and a few straggling,\r\nsolitary looking trees.  The lagoon was at this point quite shallow, and\r\nlow rocks and coral patches appeared above the surface, at short\r\ndistances apart, nearly to the centre of the channel.  The reef\r\nopposite, was entirely under water, and its position was indicated only\r\nby a line of breakers.  A large portion of the point, comprising several\r\nacres, was covered with the rude nests of various aquatic birds.  Many\r\nof these nests were occupied even at that hour, and the birds seemed in\r\nno wise alarmed, or even disturbed by our approach.  When we came very\r\nclose to any of them, they would survey us with an air half angry, and\r\nhalf inquisitive, stretching out their long necks; and screwing their\r\nheads from side to side, so as to obtain a view of us first with one\r\neye, and then with the other; this seeming to be considered\r\nindispensable to a complete and satisfactory understanding of our\r\ncharacter and intentions.  After a thorough scrutiny, they would resume\r\ntheir former appearance of stupid indifference, as though we were\r\ncreatures altogether too unimportant to merit further notice.  They all,\r\nwithout exception, seemed perfectly tame and fearless, and quite ready\r\nto resent any infringement upon their rights.\r\n\r\nJohnny, while inspecting too closely the nest of one of them, curiously\r\nconstructed of long stiff reeds, resembling rods of steel, suddenly\r\nreceived, as a rebuke for his impertinence, a blow from the wing of the\r\noffended owner, which laid him sprawling upon his back.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this severe lesson, the gentle and amiable aspect of a\r\nlarge white bird, so far reassured him, that he ventured to make some\r\nfriendly advances, whereupon he got so severely pecked, that he at once\r\ngave up all further attempts at familiarity with any of them.  This\r\nharsh treatment, in fact, so disgusted Johnny with the whole race of\r\nsea-birds, and so impaired his faith in their innocent and inoffensive\r\nlooks, that he declared he would never have any thing more to do with\r\nthem, \"since that beautiful white bird had bitten him so savagely, when\r\nhe only offered to stroke its neck.\"\r\n\r\nSome of these birds were very large and strong: in several of the\r\nunoccupied nests I saw eggs, as large as those of the duck: they were of\r\ndifferent colours some of them prettily speckled or mottled, but most\r\nwere of an ash colour, or a whitish brown.  Eiulo pointed out two kinds,\r\nwhich he said were highly prized for food, and which, as we afterwards\r\nfound, were, in fact, nearly equal to the eggs of the domestic duck.\r\n\r\nThe heat had by this time become exceedingly uncomfortable, and we\r\nconcluded to halt until it should abate a little, at the first\r\nconvenient and pleasant spot.  Leaving the shore, which, besides being\r\nunsheltered from the sun, was so rugged with crevices and gullies, and\r\ngreat irregular blocks of coral, as to be almost impassable, we entered\r\nthe borders of the wood, and took a short cut across the point.  Johnny,\r\nin imitation of the desert islanders of the story-books, desired to give\r\nappropriate names to all the interesting or remarkable localities, with\r\nwhich we became acquainted.  He had already christened the little island\r\non which we had first landed, \"Palm-Islet,\" and the spot upon the\r\nopposite shore, abounding in brilliant shells, had, from that\r\ncircumstance, received the impromptu name of \"Pearl-shell Beach.\"  He\r\nnow proposed to call the point, \"Cape Desolation,\" from its waste and\r\nforbidding aspect; but finally fixed upon \"Sea-bird's Point,\" as being\r\nmore appropriate, the birds having, in fact, taken possession of nearly\r\nits entire area, which, judging from the warlike spirit they had\r\ndisplayed, they were likely to hold against all comers.  Having crossed\r\nthe point and reached the lagoon again, we found that the shore resumed\r\nits former character.  The forest again extended nearly to the beach,\r\nbut it was more open, and not so thickly wooded as before, and the trees\r\nwere of a finer growth, and in much greater variety; many of them being\r\nof kinds unknown to any of us.  We had not proceeded far, after\r\nregaining the beach, when we espied just such a resting-place as we were\r\nin search of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nCASTLE-HILL.\r\n\r\nTHE NOONDAY HALT--A CHARMING RESTING-PLACE--HEATHEN SKILL VERSUS\r\nCIVILISATION AND THE STORY-BOOKS.\r\n\r\n  \"Beneath the tropic rays,\r\n  Where not a shadow breaks the boundless blaze,\r\n  Earth from her lap perennial verdure pours,\r\n  Ambrosial fruits, and amaranthine flowers.\"\r\n\r\nA little way before us rose a smooth and gentle acclivity, crowned by a\r\nclump of majestic trees, which promised to afford a deeper and more\r\ngrateful shade than any other spot in sight, and we accordingly made\r\ntowards it.  On a nearer approach it proved to be more elevated than had\r\nat first appeared, and in order to reach the top, we were obliged to\r\nscale a long series of natural terraces, almost as regular as though\r\nthey had been the work of art.  From this spot there was a fine view of\r\nthe shore, the lagoon, and the ocean, to the north and west.  The trees\r\nthat covered the level space at the summit of the ascent, were varieties\r\nof a much larger growth than those generally found on the low alluvial\r\nstrip of land bordering the lagoon.  Conspicuous among them, were the\r\nmajestic candle-nut, with its white leaves and orange-coloured blossoms;\r\nthe inocarpus, a kind of tropical chestnut; and most magnificent and\r\nimposing of all, a stately tree, resembling the magnolia in its foliage\r\nand manner of growth, and thickly covered with large white flowers,\r\nedged with a delicate pink.  The ground was level as a parlour floor,\r\nand free from brushwood or undergrowth of any kind, except a few\r\nlong-leaved, fragrant ferns, and in places a thick carpet of flowering\r\nvines and creepers.  The trees were stationed at such distances apart,\r\nas to compose a fine open grove, and yet close enough to unite in one\r\nrich mass of foliage overhead, impenetrable to the rays of the sun, and\r\ncreating a sombre and almost gloomy shade, even during the fiercest\r\nglare of noonday.  In one spot, a number of gigantic trees were grouped\r\nnearly in a circle.  Their dense tops formed a leafy dome, through which\r\nnot the smallest patch of sky was visible.  Around their huge, but\r\nshapely, stems, which one might look upon as forming the pillars of a\r\nnatural temple, a number of flowering parasites twined in luxuriant\r\nwreaths, and hung in festoons from the tower branches.  A considerable\r\nspace around the boles of some of these trees was completely covered by\r\nan elegant species of creeping plant with fine cut foliage of a delicate\r\npea-green, and large clusters of scarlet blossoms, about which, swarms\r\nof brilliantly-coloured insects, of the butterfly tribe, were hovering.\r\n\r\n\"Here we may actually, and not figuratively, indulge in the luxury of\r\n`reposing on the beds of flowers,'\" said Max, throwing himself down at\r\nthe foot of a towering candle-nut, amid a soft mass of this vegetable\r\ncarpeting.  All were sufficiently tired by the long march of the\r\nmorning, to appreciate the luxury, and our entire company was soon\r\nstretched upon the ground, in attitudes in which comfort rather than\r\ngrace, was consulted.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of this, Johnny?\" said Max, \"it strikes me, as being\r\nquite romantic and like the story-books--almost up to the Arabian\r\nNights.  If the history of our adventures should ever be written, (and\r\nwhy shouldn't it be?) here's material for a _flowery_ passage.  Just see\r\nhow this would sound, for instance:--`And now our little band of\r\ntoil-worn castaways,' (that's us), `weary and faint with their\r\nwanderings through the desert, (that's Cape Desolation, or Sea-bird's\r\nPoint, or whatever Johnny in his wisdom shall conclude to call it),\r\narrived at a little oasis, (this is it), a green spot in the wilderness,\r\nblooming like the bowers of Paradise, where stretched at ease, upon beds\r\nof bright and odoriferous flowers, they reposed from the fatigues of\r\ntheir journey.'  There, that sentence, I flatter myself is equal in\r\nharmony and effect, to the opening one in the history of Rasselas,\r\nPrince of Abyssinia--there's my idea of the style in which our\r\nadventures should be recorded.\"\r\n\r\nAs we had taken no refreshment since setting out in the morning, we now\r\nbegan to feel the need of it.  At the edge of the eminence, on the\r\nsouthern side, grew several large cocoa-nut trees, fully three feet in\r\ndiameter at the base, and rising to the height of seventy or eighty feet\r\nat the very least.  Eiulo was the only one of our number, who would have\r\ndreamed of undertaking to climb either of them; he, however, after\r\nfinding a young purau, and providing himself with a strip of the bark,\r\nfastened the ends about his ankles, and then firmly clasping the trunk\r\nof one of the trees with his hands and feet alternately, the latter\r\nbeing as wide apart as the ligature would permit, he vaulted rapidly and\r\neasily upward, and soon gained the dizzy height where the nuts grew.\r\nOnce fairly perched in the tuft of the tree among the stems of the\r\nenormous leaves, where he looked scarcely larger than a monkey, he\r\nquickly supplied us with as many cocoa-nuts as we could put to present\r\nuse.  Loading ourselves with the fruit, we returned to our first\r\nresting-place, and after piling the nuts in a heap, reclined around it,\r\nafter the manner of the ancients at their banquets, while we enjoyed our\r\nrepast.  Though all these nuts were gathered from the same tree, and, in\r\nfact, from the same cluster, some of them contained nothing but liquid,\r\nthe kernel not having yet begun to form, and in these the milk was most\r\nabundant and delicious: in others, a soft, jelly-like, transparent pulp,\r\ndelicate and well-flavoured, had commenced forming on the inner shell:\r\nin others, again, this pulp had become thicker and firmer, and more like\r\nthe kernel of the imported nut, the milk having diminished in quantity,\r\nand lost in a great measure its agreeable taste.\r\n\r\nJohnny, after having tried all the different varieties with the zeal of\r\nan epicure, declared that he was beginning to get sick of cocoa-nuts: he\r\nwondered whether we should have to live entirely on cocoa-nuts and\r\nshell-fish, and whether there was not some bread-fruit on the island.\r\n\r\n\"If there is,\" said Browne, \"it will be of no use to us, unless we can\r\nfind means to make a fire, and cook it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make a fire!\" cried Johnny, \"that's easy enough--all we've got to do,\r\nis just to get two dry sticks and rub them together briskly for a few\r\nminutes.  None of the shipwrecked people I ever read of, had any trouble\r\nabout that.\"\r\n\r\n\"How lucky we are,\" cried Max, gravely, \"in having some one with us, who\r\nhas read all about all the desert islanders that have ever lived, and\r\ncan tell us just what to do in an emergency!  Please get a couple of\r\nthose dry sticks which you speak of, Johnny, and show us how unfortunate\r\ncastaways in our condition, are accustomed to kindle a fire.\"\r\n\r\nWithout seeming, in the simplicity of his heart, to suspect for a moment\r\nthe perfect good faith and sincerity of Max's compliment, Johnny\r\ncommenced casting about for some sticks or pieces of wood, with which to\r\nmake the experiment.  He soon found a fallen branch of the inocarpus,\r\nwell baked by the sun, and which had long lost every particle of\r\nmoisture.  Breaking it into two pieces, he began to rub them together\r\nwith great zeal, and apparently with perfect faith in the result:\r\ngradually he increased his exertions, manifesting a commendable\r\nperseverance, until the bark began to fly, and the perspiration to\r\nstream down his face; but still there was no fire, nor any sign of it.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Max encouraged him to proceed.\r\n\r\n\"Keep it a-going, Johnny!\" he cried, \"if you stop for half a second, you\r\nlose all your labour; only persevere, and you're sure to succeed; none\r\nof the shipwrecked people you ever read of had any trouble about it, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nBut Johnny concluded that the sticks could not be of the right kind, and\r\nnotwithstanding Max's exhortations, he at last gave up the attempt.\r\n\r\nMorton, however, not discouraged by this unfortunate result, nor by\r\nMax's disposition to make fun of the experiment expressed a belief that\r\nthe thing could be done, and after preparing the sticks by cutting away\r\none of the rounded sides of each, he went to work with an earnestness\r\nand deliberation, that caused us to augur favourably of his success.\r\nAfter nearly ten minutes powerful and incessant friction, the sticks\r\nbegan to smoke, and Johnny, tossing his cap into the air, gave an\r\nexulting \"Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nBut his rejoicing proved premature, for, though the wood fairly smoked,\r\nthat was the utmost that could be attained, and Morton was obliged to\r\ndesist, without having produced a flame.\r\n\r\nEiulo had been watching these proceedings with great interest; and he\r\nnow intimated by signs that he would make a trial.  Taking the sticks,\r\nhe cut one of them to a point, with Arthur's knife, and made a small\r\ngroove along the flat surface of the other, which he then placed with\r\none end upon the ground, and the other against his breast, the grooved\r\nside being upwards.  Placing the point of the first stick in the groove,\r\nhe commenced moving it up and down along the second, pressing them hard\r\ntogether.  The motion was at first slow and regular, but increased\r\nconstantly in rapidity.  By-and-bye the wood began to smoke again, and\r\nthen Eiulo continued the operation with greater vigour than ever.  At\r\nlength a fine dust, which had collected at the lower extremity of the\r\ngroove, actually took fire; Arthur quickly inserted the edge of a\r\nsun-dried cocoa-nut leaf in the tiny flame, and it was instantly in a\r\nblaze.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" shouted Max, \"that's what I consider a decided triumph of\r\nheathenism over civilisation, and the story-books.\"\r\n\r\nMorton now seized the sticks again, and imitating Eiulo's method of\r\nproceeding, succeeded in kindling them, though it took him a\r\nconsiderable time to do it: thus it was satisfactorily established, by\r\nactual experiment, that we could obtain a fire whenever we should want\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe question was now raised, whether we should continue our exploration\r\nfurther that day, or remain where we were until the following morning;\r\nand as the heat was still very oppressive, and we were sufficiently\r\ntired already, the latter course was unanimously determined upon.\r\n\r\nJohnny liked the spot which we occupied so well, that he proposed\r\n\"building a hut\" upon it, and making it our head-quarters, as long as we\r\nshould have to stay on the island.  It was certainly a pleasant site;\r\nand, commanding as it did a wide view of the ocean, vessels could be\r\ndescried at a greater distance, and signalled with a surer prospect of\r\nattracting notice, than from any other locality yet known to us.  From\r\nthe wooded summit, the land descended on every side--towards the shore\r\nin a series of terraces--towards the interior in one smooth and\r\ncontinuous slope, after which it again rose in a succession of densely\r\nwooded eminences, irregular and picturesque in their outlines, and each\r\nhigher than the last as you proceeded inland; the farthest of them\r\ntowering up in strong relief against the south-eastern sky.  The various\r\nshades of the masses of different kinds of foliage, with which these\r\nheights were clothed, from that of the pale-leaved candle-nut, to the\r\nsombre green of the bread-fruit groves, contributed greatly to the\r\npleasing effect of the landscape.  On the right, as you looked towards\r\nthe ocean, lay the flat tract, occupied by the sea-fowl, and which\r\nJohnny had named after them.  At nearly an equal distance on the left,\r\nthe line of the beach was broken, by what appeared to be a small grove,\r\nor clump of trees, detached from the main forest, and planted directly\r\non the line of the shore.\r\n\r\nAs we had concluded to suspend our explorations until the next day,\r\nevery one was left to his own resources for the remainder of the\r\nafternoon.  Johnny having set Morton at work, to make him a bow, \"to\r\nshoot birds with,\" began to occupy himself in the very important task of\r\nfinding an appropriate name for the height, which he finally concluded\r\nto call \"Castle-Hill,\" from its regular shape and bold steep outlines.\r\nMax extended himself on his back in the coolest nook he could find, and\r\nspreading his handkerchief over his face, to protect it from the gaudy,\r\nbut troublesome, winged insects which haunted the spot, forbade any one\r\nto disturb him on pain of his high displeasure.  Arthur, taking Eiulo\r\nwith him, proceeded upon a botanising tour about the neighbourhood, in\r\nthe hope of making some discovery that might prove useful to us.  For my\r\nown part, happening to think of the question which had been started in\r\nthe morning, as to the day of the week, I began to make a retrospect of\r\nall that had taken place since the fearful night of the mutiny, and to\r\nendeavour to fix the order of subsequent events, so as to arrive at the\r\nnumber of days we had been at sea, and upon the island.  In the course\r\nof these calculations, and while Browne and myself were discussing the\r\nmatter, he suggested the want of pencil and paper.  I found that the\r\nlast leaf had been torn from my pocket-book, and the rest were in an\r\nequally destitute condition.  In this strait, I remembered having heard\r\nArthur describe the manner in which the native children had been taught\r\nto write in the missionary schools at Eimeo, the only materials used\r\nbeing plantain leaves and a pointed stick.  I mentioned this to Browne,\r\nand we forthwith proceeded to experiment with different kinds of leaves,\r\nuntil at last we found a large heart-shaped one, which answered our\r\npurpose admirably; it was white, and soft as velvet on the under side,\r\nand marks made upon it with the rounded point of a small stick, were\r\nperfectly distinct, showing of a dark green colour upon a white ground.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon, Arthur and Eiulo returned from their tour of\r\nexamination, having made, as Arthur intimated, some discoveries, of\r\nwhich, in due time, we should all reap the benefit.  Morton having found\r\na tough and elastic kind of wood, had shaped a tolerable bow for Johnny,\r\nwhen it came to providing a string, the resources of both failed.  The\r\ndifficulty being made known to Eiulo, he volunteered to supply what was\r\nwanted, and went with Johnny and Morton into the adjoining forest to\r\nlook for a certain kind of bark, from which to make the required cord.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said Arthur, when we were left alone together; \"how capitally\r\nthis excursion has worked.  How differently things seem from what they\r\ndid yesterday, when we were at the islet, perfectly stagnant and stupid.\r\nOne would not take us for the same people.  Only let us always have\r\nsomething to do, something to interest and busy ourselves about, and we\r\nneed not be very miserable, even on a desert island.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nCAMPING OUT.\r\n\r\nA DESPERATE ENGAGEMENT--JOHNNY DISCOVERS AN \"OYSTER TREE\"--VAGRANTS, OR\r\nKINGS?--A SLEEPING PRESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\n  \"Travellers ne'er did lie,\r\n  Though fools at home condemn them: If in Naples,\r\n  I should report this now, would they believe me?\"\r\n\r\nAbout sunset we went down to the beach to bathe.  The trees along the\r\nshore were occupied by immense crowds of exemplary sea-fowl, whose\r\nregular and primitive habits of life had sent them to roost at this\r\nearly hour.  Notwithstanding their webbed feet, they managed to perch\r\nsecurely among the branches, many of which were so heavily freighted,\r\nthat they bent almost to the ground beneath their load.\r\n\r\nFinding a spot where the beach shelved off gradually into deep water,\r\nwith a smooth, firm bottom, free from shells and corallines, we had a\r\nrefreshing swim.  Afterwards, strolling along the shore by myself, I\r\nfound a large fish, beautifully marked with alternate black and yellow\r\nbands, in a shallow, fenced off from the lagoon at low water, by a coral\r\nridge.  The too eager pursuit of some of the smaller tribe of fishes,\r\nhad probably beguiled him into this trap, where he had been left by the\r\ntide, to fall a victim, as I confidently reckoned, to his own rapacity.\r\nAll escape into deep water seemed to be pretty effectually cut off and I\r\nlooked upon him as already the captive of my bow and spear; but fearing\r\nlest some of the others should come up to share the glory of securing so\r\nsplendid a prize, I forthwith set about effecting his actual capture.\r\nRolling my trowsers above my knees, I waded into the water to drive him\r\nashore; but I soon found that my task was not going to prove by any\r\nmeans as easy as I had anticipated.  My intended victim was exceedingly\r\nvigorous and active, and as ferocious as a pike.  He obstinately refused\r\nto be driven at all, and struggled and floundered as desperately as if\r\nhe already had a vivid presentiment of the frying-pan, snapping\r\nviciously at my fingers whenever I undertook to lay hold of him.  To add\r\nto the aggravating features of the case, he seemed to bristle all over\r\nwith an inordinate and unreasonable quantity of sharp-pointed fins and\r\nspines, which must have been designed by nature as weapons of defence,\r\nsince there were certainly more of them than any fish could use to\r\nadvantage for swimming purposes.  I began to suspect that I had caught a\r\nTartar; but I had now gone too far to back out with credit: my\r\nself-respect wouldn't admit of the thought.  So, taking a short\r\nbreathing spell, I again advanced to the attack, somewhat encouraged by\r\nperceiving that my scaly antagonist seemed exhausted and distressed by\r\nhis recent exertions.  His mouth was wide open, and his gills quivered;\r\nbut I was rather uncertain whether to regard this as a hostile\r\ndemonstration, or a sign of pain and fatigue.  However, at it we went;\r\nand, after getting my hands badly cut by some of the aforesaid bristling\r\nspines and fins, besides being drenched with water, and plastered all\r\nover with wet sand, which he splashed about in the struggle, I succeeded\r\nin seizing him firmly by the tail, and throwing him high and dry upon\r\nthe beach.  I then scooped out a hollow in the sand, a little above the\r\ntide-mark, and filling it with water, pushed him into it, thus securing\r\nhim for the present.\r\n\r\nMax, Morton, and Browne, who had been practising climbing cocoa-nut\r\ntrees, at the edge of the wood, with very indifferent success, had\r\nwitnessed, from a distance, the latter part of the \"engagement,\" as Max\r\nfacetiously called it; and they now came up to learn the particulars,\r\nand to inquire \"whether it was a shark, or a young whale, that I had\r\nbeen having such a terrible time with.\"  While they were admiring my\r\ncaptive, and jocosely condoling with me on the hard usage which I had\r\nreceived, the voice of Johnny, (who, accompanied by Eiulo, had ventured\r\nto stroll off in the direction of the point), was heard, raised to its\r\nhighest pitch, as he shouted for us to \"come and see something strange.\"\r\nBut it seemed that his impatience would not permit him to await the\r\nresult of his summons, for the next moment he came running towards us in\r\na state of great excitement, and all out of breath, crying out that he\r\nhad \"found a tree covered with oysters,\" and he had no doubt, there were\r\n\"lots more of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"A tree covered with _what_?\" inquired Browne, dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"With oysters--with fine, large oysters!\" cried Johnny, \"just come and\r\nsee for yourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful island! productive soil!\" exclaimed Max, in mock admiration.\r\n\"If oysters will take root, and grow here, I suppose pretty much any\r\nthing will: I believe I will plant my boots to-morrow: they may do for\r\nseed, and are good for nothing else any longer--don't you begin to think\r\nthis must be an enchanted island, Johnny?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, you may make fun of it, if you please; but it's true: and if you'll\r\ncome with me, I'll shew you the trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Browne, \"I am ready for almost any thing in the way of the\r\nmarvellous, since having seen a solid and substantial-looking island\r\nturn into a vapour, and vanish away before my very eyes.  I shall be\r\ncareful about doubting any thing, until I get back to some Christian\r\ncountry, where things go on regularly.  For the present, I am in state\r\nof mind to believe in phoenixes and unicorns--and why not in\r\noyster-trees?  Who knows but we have happened upon a second Prospero's\r\nisle?  Lead on, Johnny, and bring us to this wonderful tree.\"  And\r\nJohnny started off accordingly, followed by Browne and Morton.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the latter was heard calling out, \"I say, Max! do you\r\nunderstand conchology?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, enough to tell a bivalve when I see one: should like to have a\r\n`dozen fried' before me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"If a `dozen raw' will answer, just step this way, and we'll accommodate\r\nyou equal to Florence.\"\r\n\r\nOn hastening to the spot, all scepticism as to the \"oysters growing on\r\ntrees,\" was speedily removed.  A row of mangroves lined the shore for\r\nsome distance, each elevated upon its white pile of protruding and\r\nintertwisted roots.  Attached to the branches of these trees, which\r\noverhung the water and drooped into it at high tide, were abundance of\r\nfair-sized oysters.  Looking down into the water beneath the mangroves,\r\nI perceived the certain indications of an extensive and well-stocked\r\noyster-bed.  The bottom was thickly covered with them, in every stage of\r\ngrowth multitudes being scarcely larger than a sixpence.  I could also\r\nsee, through the shallow water, an immense number of little white\r\nspecks, like drops of spermaceti, scattered about among them.  It was\r\nevident, that here was an abundant and unfailing supply of these\r\ndelicious shell-fish.\r\n\r\nBrowne broke off from one of the trees a large branch, having half a\r\ndozen oysters attached to it, with which he hastened to confront the\r\nunbelieving Max, and flourishing it in his face, demanded to know if he\r\nwas \"convinced now.\"  Although constrained to admit that they _looked_\r\nvery like oysters, Max seemed to consider the evidence of more than one\r\nof the senses necessary to afford satisfactory proof of so extraordinary\r\na phenomenon, and accordingly proceeded to see how they tasted.\r\n\r\nAfter opening one of the largest, (using his cutlass as an\r\noyster-knife), and making the experiment with due deliberation, he\r\nannounced himself perfectly satisfied.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had all sufficiently tasted the quality of the oysters,\r\n(which were really very good, and well-flavoured, notwithstanding the\r\nunusual position in which they were discovered), it had become quite\r\ndark.  Though the evening was fine, there was not much light, the moon\r\nand stars glimmering faintly through a soft purple haze, which, as I had\r\nobserved since we had been on the island, generally seemed to fill the\r\natmosphere for a short time after sunset, and at a little later hour\r\nentirely disappeared.  As we strolled back towards the foot of\r\n\"Castle-Hill,\" Johnny suddenly looked up, and inquired, as if the\r\nthought had just occurred to him, where we were going to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"That's a pretty question to ask,\" said Browne, laughing, \"it implies\r\nthat we are common vagrants.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we are, strictly speaking,\" answered Max, \"we have no regular means\r\nof living, and no fixed place of abode, and that I believe, makes us\r\ncommon vagrants, according to Webster.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think our means of living were `regular' enough to rescue us\r\nfrom the definition,\" replied Morton, \"having been thus far, cocoa-nuts\r\nand mussels every day, and all day long, and nothing but cocoa-nuts and\r\nmussels.  I am glad that there is now some prospect of a little more\r\nirregularity in future.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to our having no fixed habitation or place of abode,\" said Browne,\r\n\"that does not arise from poverty, or lack of land--`the isle is all\r\nbefore us where to choose'--and we are now on a tour of observation\r\nthrough our extensive domains, in order to decide upon the finest spot\r\nfor our head-quarters.  Meantime, for a night or two, we shall have to\r\nbe satisfied with `a tent in the green wood, a home in the grove,' in\r\nother words, we shall have to `camp out,' as the most renowned hunters\r\nand soldiers have frequently done before us.  I'm sure there's no\r\nvagrancy in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" cried Johnny, forgetting for the moment his anxiety on the score\r\nof our quarters for the night, \"we are no more vagrants than Robinson\r\nCrusoe was:--\r\n\r\n  \"`We are monarchs of all we survey,\r\n  And our realm there is none to dispute,'\r\n\r\n\"As he says of himself so that we are much more like kings than\r\nvagrants.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the sea-birds and fishes,\" said Max, \"are to be considered as our\r\nsubjects, I presume, since we have no man Friday, and no goats or\r\npoll-parrots to reign over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Johnny, \"I suppose so; there are enough of them too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And some very disloyal, rebellious, and stiff-necked ones among them,\"\r\nadded Max, \"who ought to be dealt with as traitors forthwith--that\r\nsturdy feathered rebel for instance, who, not regarding the\r\ninviolability of the royal person, no longer ago than this morning laid\r\none of our royal majesties sprawling upon his royal back.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that other scaly traitor,\" added Browne, \"who perversely refused to\r\ncome out of the water to be cooked, in accordance with the royal will,\r\nand who nearly bit off the sacred thumb of one of our majesties, in\r\nresisting the royal authority.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Johnny,\" said Max, \"if we are not actually kings, we at any rate\r\nhave some royal blood upon the island.  Not to speak of myself, who am\r\ndescended direct from `Kaiser Maximilien,' here is Eiulo, who is a real\r\nprince, his father being King of the Cannibal Islands, or some other\r\nislands in these seas.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you wouldn't speak so of Eiulo's father,\" said Johnny, warmly,\r\n\"he is not a cannibal, and I believe he is a very good man; I think his\r\nislands are near here, and if we should one day get there, he would\r\ntreat us kindly, and let us go home whenever we should have an\r\nopportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hilloa!\" cried Max, \"what has put all that into your head?  What do you\r\nknow about Eiulo's father, or his islands, or where they are?\"\r\n\r\nThis sudden outburst of Johnny's surprised us all, with perhaps the\r\nexception of Arthur, and we listened with some interest, as he replied\r\nto Max's volley of questions.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have talked with Eiulo about it,\" he answered, \"mostly by signs;\r\nand he has made me understand that he believes his home is not far\r\ndistant--off in that direction, (pointing north), and that ships\r\nsometimes stop there; and so I have been thinking that if we could only\r\nfind the way there, we should have some prospect of getting home at\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this we became silent and thoughtful; nothing further was said,\r\nuntil Johnny recurred to the question which he had started a few moments\r\nbefore, and again asked where we proposed to pass the night.\r\n\r\n\"Not in those gloomy woods, I hope,\" said he, \"where it is so lonely,\r\nand the wind and the trees make such strange noises.  I would rather\r\nsleep down here upon the shore; this nice dry, white sand, up where the\r\nwater never comes, will make a very good bed.\"\r\n\r\nThus far, we had passed every night upon the islet, to which we had now\r\nbecome familiarised and accustomed.  Its small extent, and separation\r\nfrom the mainland, gave it an air of security, which made us feel more\r\nat our ease there at night, than we could among the sombre and\r\nunexplored forests of the larger island, about which we as yet knew so\r\nlittle.  Johnny's timidity was not therefore unnatural.  Indeed, unless\r\nI am mistaken, none of us was, on this first night of our exploration,\r\nentirely free from a vague spirit of insecurity, and of liability to\r\nsome unknown danger.\r\n\r\n\"That will hardly do, Johnny,\" said Browne, in answer to his suggestion\r\nabout taking up our quarters for the night upon the shore, \"a heap of\r\ndry pandanus leaves will make a much more comfortable bed than the hard\r\nsand.  Thus I propose to arrange it--we will go up to the top of the\r\nhill where we rested to-day, and lodge there; our beds of leaves shall\r\nbe all in a circle, and Johnny's shall be in the middle; and then he\r\nwon't feel lonesome or afraid, for all the uncanny noises of the wind\r\nand the trees; knowing that he has good friends and true all around him,\r\nand particularly one stout John Browne, who is worth all the rest\r\ntogether, being a fair match for any thing in this part of the\r\nSouth-Seas!\" and by way of raising Johnny's spirits, and inspiring him\r\nwith the greater confidence in the prowess of his protector, he\r\nflourished his cutlass, and went scientifically through the broad-sword\r\nexercise, slashing and carving away at his imaginary antagonist, with a\r\nfierceness and vigour wonderful to behold, having lopped off an\r\nindefinite quantity of airy heads and limbs, be finished, by reciting\r\nwith a bold and warlike air--\r\n\r\n  \"Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled!\r\n  Scots wham Bruce has aften led!\" etcetera.\r\n\r\nThis demonstration seemed to produce the desired effect and Johnny soon\r\nbecame reassured, and quite reconciled to \"camping out\" in the woods.\r\n\r\nThe evening was so fine, and the gentle breeze setting in from the ocean\r\nwas so cool and grateful, after the excessive heat of the day, that we\r\ncontinued for some time loitering along the shore.  The sea was highly\r\nphosphorescent; that is, during the earlier part of the evening, and\r\nbefore the mist or haze before spoken of cleared up.  The tiny wavelets,\r\nas they rippled upon the beach in rapid succession, sparkled with\r\nphosphoric fire, and out in the lagoon, wherever a coral patch rose to\r\nthe surface, or the water was disturbed by any floating object, it gave\r\nforth a clear and brilliant light, and was studded by myriads of fiery\r\ndots and spangles.\r\n\r\nAt length Johnny began to complain of weariness, and we scaled the\r\nterraced hill, and gathering a large quantity of clean and well-dried\r\nleaves, arranged our beds as Browne had suggested, beneath the group of\r\nnoble trees where we had taken our siesta at noon.\r\n\r\nThe novelty of our situation, long proved with me an effectual antidote\r\nto fatigue and drowsiness, and I lay, looking up at the moon glimmering\r\nthrough the foliage of the trees, an hour after the rest seemed to be\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nJust as I was at last sinking into unconsciousness, Johnny, sitting up\r\namong the leaves in which he was half buried, inquired softly, \"Max, are\r\nyou awake!\"  I spoke to him, to let him know that he was not alone.  \"I\r\ncan't get asleep,\" said he, \"every thing looks so beautiful and so\r\nstrange.  It seems to me I never saw the moon and the stars so big and\r\nso bright.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must keep your eyes shut, and not look at the moon, if you want to\r\nget asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the trees keep rustling so; just as if they were whispering softly\r\nto one another; and then the sound of the waves on the reef is so sad\r\nand mournful, that it sets me to thinking all sorts of strange things.\r\nI wonder whether there are any wild animals on the island!\"  I assured\r\nhim that it was quite improbable, and that no dangerous animals of any\r\nkind were ever found on the islands of the Pacific.  This, however, did\r\nnot seem to satisfy him entirely, and I began to suspect that his mind\r\nwas running on the jackalls, tiger-cats, and hyenas of the Swiss Family\r\nRobinson.  A question or two which he presently asked, showed that I had\r\nguessed correctly, and I hastened to meet the difficulty, by reminding\r\nhim that \"their island, (if indeed it was an island at all, and not a\r\npart of the mainland), was situated near the coast of New Holland, from\r\nwhich animals might pass over to it by swimming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I thought,\" said Johnny, \"that there were no wild animals in New\r\nHolland, except kangaroos and opossums: my book of beasts, birds, and\r\nfishes, says so.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a fact in Natural History which I was not prepared to gainsay;\r\nespecially when backed by so redoubtable an authority as \"the book of\r\nbeasts, birds, and fishes.\"  For a moment I was taken all aback; but\r\nbeing loathe to give up my little companion a prey to imaginary\r\njackalls, tiger-cats, and hyenas, I rallied again, resolved upon one\r\nmore desperate effort for his deliverance.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"the fact is, we don't know exactly where the Swiss\r\nFamily Robinson's island really was--it is altogether uncertain.  It may\r\nhave been near Java, or Ceylon, or the coast of India, in which case,\r\nall those Asiatic beasts could easily have got there--that is, if the\r\ntwo places were close enough together.  Now we know that we are\r\nsomewhere in the middle of the Pacific, a vast distance from any\r\ncontinent, or any of the great Indian islands, so that large animals\r\nhere are out of the question, unless they have taken a swim of a\r\nthousand miles or so.\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be pretty decisive; and I think it settled the jackalls,\r\ntiger-cats, and hyenas, effectually, for Johnny said no more on the\r\nsubject, except to remark, that, even if they _could_ swim that\r\ndistance, they would stand a bad chance with the sharks and other\r\nsea-monsters; to which I added, as a final clincher, that in any event\r\nthey would be sure to starve on the voyage, unless they should bring a\r\nlarge supply of provisions along.  \"Well,\" said he, after a minute's\r\nsilence, \"I'm not afraid of anything; but somehow or other I feel very\r\nwide awake to-night, and not in the least sleepy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut your eyes,\" said I, \"and think of a great wheel, whirling round\r\nand round, with a regular and even motion, and never stopping, until you\r\nhave counted it go round a hundred times.\"\r\n\r\nJohnny laughed softly to himself, as though pleased with this device,\r\nand was quite still for a minute or two; then he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"It has gone round a hundred times, but towards the end it got a-going\r\ndreadfully fast; it _would_ go fast in spite of all I could do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind the wheel, then,\" said I, \"but think of the huge lazy swells\r\nin a calm, rising and falling, rising and falling, as they did when we\r\nlay rocking in the boat, all those long days and nights, out on the\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll try--but I don't believe it will be of any use.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't look at the moon, and don't speak to me again--unless for\r\nsomething very particular--and now good night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night!\" and he nestled down among his leaves again.  In a very few\r\nminutes the deep and regular breathing of the little patient, proved the\r\nefficacy of my sleeping prescription, and announced that his troubles\r\nfor that night were over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC EMBARRASSMENTS.\r\n\r\nA DESERT ISLAND BREAKFAST--PERSUASIVE REASONING--ROMANCE AND REALITY--\r\nTHE PRINCE AND PRINCESS.\r\n\r\n  \"Now my co-mates, and brothers in exile,\r\n  Hath not long custom made this life more sweet\r\n  Than that of painted pomp?  Are not these woods\r\n  More free from peril than the envious court?\r\n  Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,\r\n  The seasons' difference; as the icy fang\r\n  And churlish chiding of the winter's wind.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning \"the Islanders,\" or some of them, at least, were\r\nstirring early; and the first thing that attracted my attention, on\r\nopening my eyes, was a busy group, consisting of Max, Eiulo, and Johnny,\r\ngathered round a fire at a little distance, and engaged in some\r\napparently very interesting operation.  A savoury smell at the same time\r\nsaluted my olfactory organs, and on approaching the scene of action, to\r\ninvestigate the matter more closely, I found my finny prize of the\r\npreceding evening undergoing a somewhat primitive style of cookery, of\r\nwhich Max appeared to be the chief director and superintendent.  A\r\nnumber of large oysters were also roasting in the embers; and from these\r\nlast proceeded the grateful and appetising odour referred to.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning!\" cried Max; \"you see we have breakfast nearly ready; and\r\na breakfast, too, that will be a positive luxury, after so long a course\r\nof cocoa-nut diet; how Browne will exult at the sight of it; how his\r\neyes will open--to say nothing of his mouth!  And don't we deserve a\r\nvote of thanks for our early labours for the general good?\"\r\n\r\nMorton and Browne at this moment emerged from their respective heaps of\r\nleaves, and, after rather more than the usual amount of yawning and\r\nstretching of limbs, came towards the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Fee, faw, fo, fum!\" cried Morton, snuffing the agreeable smell of the\r\ncookery in progress, \"I trust we're not too late for breakfast, and that\r\nthere is something more than the savour of good victuals left.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are in good time,\" said Johnny, bustling about the fire with an air\r\nof official dignity, \"the first bell hasn't rung yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why has Shakespeare such a long face?\" said Max; \"has camping out\r\ncaused a reminiscence of rheumatism!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad dreams, horrible dreams!\" answered Browne, shaking his head\r\nsolemnly, \"which came of lying staring at the moon last night, until I\r\nfell asleep:\"--then throwing himself into an attitude, he commenced\r\ndeclaiming with a tragic air--\r\n\r\n  \"`O, I have passed a miserable night,\r\n  So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,\r\n  That as I am a Christian, faithful man,\r\n  I would not pass another such a night\r\n  Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,\r\n  So full of dismal terror was the time.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" cried Max, applauding furiously, \"I like to see that; it's what\r\nI call coming out strong under discouraging circumstances.  Here are we,\r\nsix forlorn castaways, on a desert island, somewhere, (no one knows\r\nwhere), in the Pacific Ocean; and, instead of moping, and sulking, and\r\nbemoaning our hard fate, we wake up of a fine morning, quite bright and\r\ncheerful, and one of the six, (or seven, more correctly speaking), goes\r\nto work spouting Shakespeare, carrying us back to old times, and making\r\nus feel, (as Morton would say), like `happy schoolboys again.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What's all this?\" cried Arthur, coming forward with a puzzled air,\r\n\"what is Max making a speech about? has he taken the stump as a\r\ncandidate for the presidency of the island?\"\r\n\r\n\"He needn't do that,\" said Browne, \"we're not going to have any\r\npresidents, or other republican trumpery here; I have formally taken\r\npossession of the island in the name of Victoria; and it is therefore a\r\ncolony of Great Britain; I shall apply, at the first convenient\r\nopportunity, for letters patent, making me colonial governor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tory, monarchist!\" cried Max, \"recant at once, or you sha'n't taste a\r\nmouthful of my breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I'll sell my loyalty for a mess of pottage!  No, I'm for a\r\nwell-regulated monarchy: hurrah for Victoria!\"\r\n\r\n\"Down with the Britisher!\" cried Johnny, entering into the spirit of the\r\nscene, and tugging at Browne's coat-tails; \"make him hurrah for the\r\nstars and stripes, or else don't give him any of our oysters!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're surely not going back to the principles of the dark ages--you\r\nwon't attack the right of private judgement, and persecute for opinion's\r\nsake.\"\r\n\r\n\"The right of private judgment, indeed!\" answered Max, with great\r\ncontempt.  \"I hold that no person can have a right, on any pretence\r\nwhatever, to entertain erroneous opinions on important subjects,\r\naffecting the welfare of mankind.  If a man does entertain such\r\nopinions, it is the duty of those who know better to convince him of the\r\nerror by the most effectual arguments at their command.  It is,\r\ntherefore, my duty to open your eyes to the blessings of liberal\r\ninstitutions.  I have here, (pointing towards the incipient breakfast),\r\nthe most powerful means to assist and quicken your perception of the\r\ntruth.  Shall I not use those means?\"\r\n\r\n\"The line of argument which you indicate is exceedingly forcible, (how\r\ndelightfully those oysters smell!)  I really think I begin to perceive\r\nsome of the advantages of republicanism already.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the right of private judgment, properly understood,\" resumed Max,\r\n\"I should be reluctant to interfere.  You will, I presume, enjoy the\r\nexercise of so precious a privilege, even with a cocoa-nut breakfast,\r\nwhich you can probably obtain, by requesting Prince Eiulo to scale one\r\nof yonder tufted trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"How clear the matter becomes with a little reflection,\" observed Browne\r\n\"(this camping out in the open air gives one a famous appetite).  In\r\nfact your reasoning is almost irresistible, (that fish looks\r\nparticularly nice), and really I begin to think I can safely profess\r\nmyself a good republican--until after breakfast at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nMax's culinary operations being at last completed, Johnny placed a huge\r\nshell to his lips, and sounded a long blast by way of announcement that\r\nbreakfast was ready.  The fish was served up in a fresh palm-leaf, and\r\nJohnny declared with much complacency, that not all the crockery-stores\r\nin New York, could furnish a platter of such royal dimensions.  The\r\nleaves of the hibiscus, served admirably for plates; for knives and\r\nforks, we used the strong stalks, or central fibres, of cocoa-nut\r\nleaflet; which, with fingers in reserve for an emergency, answered at\r\nleast as well as the chopsticks of the Chinese.  Upon the whole, it\r\ncannot be denied that our table-service, simple as it was, has its\r\nadvantages: it involved no necessity for any washing of dishes, no\r\nanxiety on the score of broken crockery, and we could indulge in the\r\nextravagance of a new dinner set every day, or even at every meal, for\r\nthat matter, if so disposed.\r\n\r\nThe fish proved most excellent, resembling the striped bass in flavour\r\nand appearance: as to the oysters, they were unanimously voted equal to\r\nShrewsburys.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" sighed Max, \"if we had now but a cup of coffee and a hot roll,\r\nthose inestimable blessings of civilisation, we could almost forget that\r\nwe are on a desert island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait until the bread-fruit ripens,\" said Arthur, \"and we shall have a\r\ntolerably fair substitute for your `hot rolls.'  Eiulo will show us the\r\nmost approved mode of preparing it, and we shall find it nearly equal to\r\nthe wheaten loaf.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that Max seems to think about, is the eating,\" said Browne,\r\nswallowing the last remaining oyster, \"but I begin to feel troubled\r\nabout another matter: see, I am getting fairly out at the elbows, and\r\nneither `coffee and rolls,' nor roast-beef and plum-pudding in\r\nindefinite quantities, would afford me any satisfaction, compared to the\r\npossession of a supply of clothing, or even a few changes of linen--in\r\nfact, comrades, what are we to do?  There is danger that we shall all\r\nbecome savages: I begin to feel a loss of self-respect already.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to go into the manufacturing business, I suppose,\" said\r\nArthur.  \"I have often watched the whole process of making tappa, or\r\nnative cloth, from the bark of the paper-mulberry; it is quite simple,\r\nand I have no doubt we can succeed in it; I have talked with Eiulo on\r\nthe subject and find that he understands the process thoroughly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are there any paper-mulberries on the island!\" inquired Morton.\r\n\r\n\"I have not seen any,\" answered Arthur.  \"If there are none, the bark of\r\nthe bread-fruit tree will answer nearly as well: the cloth made from it\r\nis as strong and durable, though not so fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the present, and before we go into home manufactures,\" said Max, \"I\r\nadvise Shakespeare, in order to avoid the loss of his remaining\r\nself-respect in consequence of wearing foul linen, to betake himself to\r\nthe beach, wash his garments, and take a bath until they dry in the sun,\r\nwhich is the course I intend to pursue myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are we going to do for shoes, I wonder!\" said Johnny, \"mine\r\nare badly cracked and torn, and nearly worn out: we shall all have to go\r\nbarefoot!\" and he looked aghast at the thought.\r\n\r\n\"We must kill a shark by-and-bye,\" said Arthur, \"when we have nothing\r\nmore pressing to do; and we can make leggins, or moccasins, from the\r\nskin.\"\r\n\r\n\"How these things kill the romance and poetry of desert island life!\"\r\nsaid Max, \"there's no romance about being out at the elbows, or being\r\nobliged to wear dirty linen--\"\r\n\r\n\"Or in doing one's own washing in salt-water, and sitting naked while\r\none's clothes are drying,\" interposed Browne, pathetically.\r\n\r\n\"Or in having your toes poke out at the end of your boots,\" added\r\nMorton, advancing his right foot in illustration.\r\n\r\n\"No! these are all stern realities,\" said Max, \"cases not provided for\r\nin the story-books; how is it, Johnny, are there any precedents going to\r\nshow how desert islanders do their washing and mending?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they generally saved heaps of clothes from the wreck,\" answered\r\nJohnny, gravely.  \"Robinson Crusoe brought off several chests,\r\ncontaining ever so many sailors' clothes of all sorts; whether there\r\nwere any shoes or not, I don't remember: the Swiss family Robinson also\r\nobtained an abundance of such things from the wreck of their ship before\r\nit sunk; Philip Quarll made garments for himself from the skins of\r\nanimals.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are we to do? we havn't any wreck from which to supply\r\nourselves with chests of clothing, with arms and ammunition, and stores\r\nof ship-biscuit and salt provisions.  We're worse off it seems, than any\r\nof our predecessors.  And since we are not supplied with the requisite\r\ncapital and stock-in-trade for desert islanders, it is reasonable to\r\ninfer that we are not destined to a Robinson Crusoe life, so that we may\r\nconfidently expect to be taken off by some ship, in a short time.\"\r\n\r\nAs we were finishing our breakfast, a couple of tiny, fairy-like tern,\r\ncame flying round us.  They were very tame, and hovered smoothly over\r\nour heads, at the distance of sometimes but a few feet.  Their plumage\r\nwas snowy-white, and as they glided quietly around, peering curiously\r\ninto our faces, you could almost fancy that there was the gleam of\r\nintelligence in their large eyes.\r\n\r\n\"O, what beautiful little birds!\" cried Johnny, in great delight: \"I\r\nwish I had some crumbs of bread for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows, Johnny,\" suggested Max, \"but these strange little birds, as\r\nthey seem to be, are no birds, after all, but an unfortunate prince and\r\nprincess, who having incurred the resentment of some potent enchanter,\r\nhave been transformed by his magical arts into their present shape, and\r\nbanished to this desert island; and have now come to us for sympathy and\r\nassistance--see what a mournful expression there is in their mild dark\r\neyes!\"  Johnny was pleased with the conceit, and the little tern were\r\nalways afterwards known as the prince and princess.  They frequently\r\ncame hovering around us in the most friendly and fearless manner, when\r\nwe were in that part of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\nA VOICE IN THE WOODS--VIVE NAPOLEON!--CALCULATING THE LONGITUDE--THE\r\n\"WILD FRENCHMAN'S\" HAT.\r\n\r\n  _Stephano_.  Hark! what sound is that?\r\n  _Caliban_.  Art thou afeard, master?\r\n  _Stephano_.  No, monster, not I.\r\n  _Caliban_.  Be not afeard: the isle is full of noises.\r\n\r\nOur failure to discover fresh water, or any indications of it, during\r\nyesterday's expedition, increased the anxiety which we felt on the\r\nsubject and we determined to devote the day to a continuation of the\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nThe base of Castle-Hill was skirted on the left and divided from the\r\nneighbouring forest by a deep gully, that had much the appearance of a\r\ndried-up water-course, and was probably a channel by which, in the rainy\r\nseason, the water from the higher ground was conveyed to the sea.  From\r\nthe hill we could trace the course of the ravine, until it struck the\r\nbeach, near the point where the small grove, before spoken of, seemed to\r\nspring up out of the lagoon.  Our last evening's ramble along the shore\r\nhad extended nearly to this spot and to avoid going over the same ground\r\na second time, we struck into the ravine, and followed its course as it\r\ndescended towards the beach.\r\n\r\nJohnny every now and then, without any apparent object, unless to evince\r\nhis entire superiority to any feeling of timidity, separated himself\r\nfrom the rest and disappeared for a time in the forest, generally\r\nreturning with a specimen of some new plant or flower, or an account of\r\nsome strange bird, or curious tree, which he had seen.  From one of\r\nthese adventurous excursions, he came rushing back; closely followed by\r\nEiulo, both looking a good deal frightened, and, as soon as he had\r\nrecovered breath sufficiently to be able to speak, he earnestly affirmed\r\nthat he had heard a man call out to him in the wood.  His statement was\r\nstrange enough; he had found a twining plant, with a flower like a\r\nmorning glory, and called loudly for Eiulo, who was a little way off, to\r\ncome and see if it was the patara vine.  The root of this plant is a\r\nvaluable and nutritious esculent, and Arthur had described the leaf and\r\nflower to us, in order that we might recognise it if met with.\r\nImmediately a harsh voice issued from a neighbouring thicket, uttering\r\nsome words which he did not distinctly understand, but they were in\r\nFrench, and were something about Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\"In French!--and about Napoleon!\" cried Arthur, in amazement.  \"Are you\r\nquite sure, Johnny, that you heard any words at all;--any thing more\r\nthan a strange noise of some kind?\"\r\n\r\nBut Johnny was positive;--he had heard the \"Napoleon,\" as plainly as he\r\never heard any thing.  There were only a few words--not more than two or\r\nthree, but they were spoken very distinctly, and quite loud, as if the\r\nperson were cheering; he could not be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"Only two or three words,\" pursued Arthur, \"would you know them again if\r\nyou should hear them repeated?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think I should.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it `Vive Napoleon!' that you heard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are the very words!\" cried Johnny; \"they were spoken as plainly\r\nas you speak them, but in a rougher voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see any thing--did you look towards the thicket!\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw something stir, but could not tell what it was.  The voice was\r\nharsh and angry, and I was frightened, and ran away as fast as I could.\r\nI thought perhaps it was a wild man--some one who had been shipwrecked\r\nhere many years ago, and lived alone in the woods until he had grown\r\nwild or mad.\"\r\n\r\nJohnny was so positive in this singular story, that for a moment we\r\nhardly knew what to think of it.  Eiulo too had heard the voice--the\r\nsame harsh voice that Johnny described as issuing from the thicket.  But\r\nthe notion of any person amusing himself by shouting \"Vive Napoleon!\" in\r\nthe forests of a solitary island in the Pacific, seemed so preposterous,\r\nthat we could not help coming to the conclusion, that some sudden noise\r\nin the wood had seemed to Johnny's excited imagination like a human\r\nvoice--though why he should fancy that it uttered those particular\r\nwords--the words of a strange language, was a puzzle which we could not\r\nsolve.  We, however, turned into the forest, and Johnny pointed out the\r\nspot where he was standing when he heard the voice.  There were the\r\nvines, with flowers like morning-glories; and there was the thicket\r\nwhence, as he alleged, the sound had proceeded.  We shouted aloud\r\nseveral times, but there was no response, except from a large bird that\r\nrose heavily into the air, uttering a discordant scream; and we were\r\nsatisfied that it was this, or some similar sound, that had startled\r\nJohnny; in which conviction we dismissed the matter from our minds.\r\n\r\nThe flowering vine proved to be the patara, which Arthur had been so\r\nanxious to discover, and on digging it up, two roots, resembling large\r\npotatoes, were found attached to the stalk.  Quite a number of these\r\nplants were scattered about the neighbourhood; enough, as Arthur said,\r\nto make a tolerable potato patch.\r\n\r\nAll this time Max was missing, having been some little distance in\r\nadvance of the rest, when Johnny had raised his strange alarm.  When we\r\ngot back into the ravine, he was not in sight, but we had hardly resumed\r\nour progress towards the shore, when we heard him calling out that he\r\nhad found water.  At this announcement, our orderly march broke at once\r\ninto a hasty scramble.  Browne alone maintained his dignity, and came on\r\nat his usual elephantine pace, probably suspecting that the pretended\r\ndiscovery was a hoax.  Morton and I raced along the hollow, \"neck and\r\nneck,\" till we suddenly reached a point where there was an abrupt\r\ndescent to the level of the shore.  We were under too much headway to be\r\nable to stop, and jumping together down the steep bank, we narrowly\r\nmissed alighting upon Max, as he lay extended on the ground, scooping up\r\nwater with his hand, from the basin of a small pool.  I came down close\r\nbeside him, while Morton, sprang fairly over his head, and alighted with\r\na great splash in the centre of the pool.  I had barely time to roll out\r\nof the way, when the others, with the exception of Browne, came tumbling\r\nin their turn over the bank, which took them as much by surprise as it\r\nhad us.  Morton's lamentable figure, as he stood motionless in the midst\r\nof the pool, drenched with water, and with a great patch of black mud\r\nplastered over one eye, together with Max's look of consternation at his\r\nown narrow escape, were irresistibly ludicrous, and provoked a laugh, in\r\nwhich, after a moment, they both heartily joined.\r\n\r\n\"Very obliging of you, Morton,\" said Max, recovering his\r\nself-possession, \"I wanted to see how deep it was, and you are a good\r\nenough measuring-stick; just stand still a minute, if you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have reason to feel obliged to me,\" answered Morton, extricating\r\nhimself from the mud, \"it was on your account solely that I got into\r\nthis pickle.  I had to choose between breaking your neck, as you lay\r\nright in my way, or jumping into this hole, and not having much time to\r\ndeliberate, it isn't surprising if I came to a foolish conclusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be less unfeeling,\" replied Max, \"as well as more strictly\r\naccording to the facts of the case, to say a hasty conclusion, which\r\nmight be understood literally, and would then be literally correct.\"\r\n\r\nThe water, which we found to be good, though slightly brackish, was\r\ncontained in a narrow pit situated in the centre of a circular hollow,\r\nor basin.  It was not more than half full, but its sides showed a fresh\r\nand distinct water-mark, more than a foot above the present level.  At\r\nthe edge of the basin, a solitary palm shot upward its straight shaft,\r\nto the height of nearly a hundred feet; the long, fringed leaves\r\ndrooping from the top, like a bunch of gigantic ostrich plumes, and\r\novershadowing the well.  It seemed difficult to account for this supply\r\nof fresh water in so unpromising a spot, and so near the sea-shore.  I\r\nwas at first inclined to think it nothing more than a reservoir of\r\nstanding water, left by the last rains, which had filled not only the\r\npit, but also the surrounding basin.  The former being deep and narrow,\r\nevaporation would be very gradual, which might, I supposed, account for\r\nthe small quantity still remaining.\r\n\r\n\"That can hardly be,\" said Arthur, when I suggested this explanation,\r\n\"the spot is wholly unsheltered from the sun, except at noon, by this\r\nscreen of palm-leaves, and if the entire hollow were filled with water\r\nthis morning, there would not be a drop of moisture left in three days,\r\nunless the supply were renewed.  Besides, the water is too fresh and\r\nsweet to have stood since the last rains.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should judge,\" said Morton, \"that this spot is but little above the\r\nlevel of the lagoon, and if the bottom of the well here, is below that\r\nlevel at ebb tide, this supply of fresh water can be easily accounted\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rise and fall of the tide here, does not seem to be more than\r\neighteen inches, or two feet,\" said Max, \"and as to the depth of the pit\r\nor well, as you call it, you ought to be able to speak with confidence,\r\nhaving so recently been to the bottom of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are wells on the low islands of the West Indies,\" said Morton,\r\n\"which communicate with the sea, and rise and fall with the tide, the\r\nsea-water penetrating through the sand, and being distilled in its\r\npassage: and I think this is one of the same kind.  Here is a recent\r\nwater-mark, more than a foot above the present level.  If I am right, we\r\nshall find that the tide is now low.\"\r\n\r\nArthur thrust a stick into the side of the well to mark the height of\r\nthe water, while Johnny rushed furiously down to the beach, and in a\r\nmoment came posting back with the announcement that the tide _was_ low.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, so far,\" said Arthur, \"it only remains to be seen, whether,\r\nwhen the tide has risen, there will be any corresponding rise here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, meantime,\" suggested Browne, \"let us refresh ourselves with a\r\nbath, before the sun gets higher; and we can also take the opportunity\r\nto give our under garments the benefit of an ablution, as Max has\r\nproposed.\"\r\n\r\nNo one can fully appreciate the luxury of sea-bathing who has not\r\nenjoyed it within the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe calm, transparent water, with the firm white beach and bottom,\r\nlooked so deliciously cool and inviting, that the suggestion was adopted\r\nas soon as made; and the expedition with which the preliminaries were\r\ngot through with, reminded me of those eager races to \"the pond,\" on the\r\nletting out of the village school at home, of a hot summer afternoon, in\r\nwhich several of our present company had often been competitors for the\r\nhonour of being \"the first one in.\"  Arthur warned us to beware of\r\nsharks, and to keep a vigilant look-out for \"back fins,\" and our dread\r\nof those prowling and rapacious monsters, was a great drawback to the\r\nenjoyment of our bath.  In all the feats and dexterities of the\r\nswimmer's art, Eiulo far outdid the rest of us, moving through the water\r\nwith the ease, rapidity, and gracefulness of a fish.  After one or two\r\ntrials with him, in swimming under water, and diving for shells, even\r\nMax yielded the palm, declaring that he was ready to match himself\r\nagainst any land animal, but should for the future decline entering into\r\na contest of that kind with amphibious creatures.\r\n\r\nEiulo thought that this swimming in smooth water was but indifferent\r\nsport and began to talk to Arthur with great animation, in his native\r\ntongue, about the pleasures of \"faahee,\" or surf-bathing, and the\r\nexquisite fun of dodging the \"manos,\" or sharks, among the rollers.\r\nPresently he struck out into the lagoon, and before we could guess his\r\nintention, he swam over to the reef, and, picking his way across it,\r\nplunged fearlessly among the breakers on the outside.  He stayed,\r\nhowever, but a short time, and came back saying, that the \"manos\" were\r\naltogether too thick out there, and that a huge blue one, had come near\r\nseizing him in the surf, before he could catch a roller so as to land\r\nsafely upon the reef.  When blamed by Arthur for his rashness, he\r\nlaughed, and promised that he would not incur the risk again.  From his\r\nfrightened looks when he got back, I guessed that he had not found\r\n\"dodging the mano\" such exquisite fun as he had anticipated.\r\n\r\nMax presently desisted from swimming, in order, as he said, to \"do his\r\nwashing,\" consoling himself for the hardship of being obliged to do\r\nlaundress' work, with the reflection that the necessity for such a task\r\nwould soon cease, as our clothes being in constant use, without the\r\nbenefit of a change, could not last long.  Browne and I followed this\r\nexample, and having spread our garments in the sun to dry, resumed our\r\naquatic sports in the meantime.  Arthur dressed himself and accompanied\r\nby Eiulo, left us, saying that he would rejoin us in an hour at the\r\nhill.  The two proceeded a short distance along the shore to the right,\r\nand then turned into the forest to search, as we supposed, for plants,\r\nor roots, capable of being turned to useful account.\r\n\r\nBy the time our clothes were sufficiently dry to be put on, the tide had\r\nrisen considerably, and on repairing to the well, we found the water\r\nseveral inches above Arthur's mark, thus confirming Morton's theory in\r\nregard to it.  Though we should have been better pleased to have\r\ndiscovered a spring, yet there was no reason to doubt that here was an\r\nample and permanent supply of fresh water.\r\n\r\nAs it was now getting towards noon, and the day was excessively hot, we\r\nreturned to Castle-Hill, to enjoy the grateful shade of its cool, dark\r\ngroves, and the breeze which was sure to play about its summit, if air\r\nwas stirring any where.  Max sought out a leafy bower of ferns and\r\ncreepers, near the foot of the great candle-nut tree, where he stretched\r\nhimself out and went to sleep.  Johnny got his bow and arrows, and began\r\nto practise archery, by shooting at the large and gaudy insects hovering\r\naround the blossoms of the vines, and when, probably by accident, he\r\ncarried away the wing of one of them at the distance of some six or\r\nseven yards, he boasted loudly of the exploit, and intimated that in\r\ncase of a brush with any cannibals, his bow might be relied on to do\r\nsome execution.  Getting tired at length of his crusade against the\r\nbutterflies, he expressed a wish to try his skill upon some larger game,\r\nbut as nothing in the shape of a jackall or tiger-cat was obliging\r\nenough to make its appearance, he put aside his weapons with a sigh, and\r\nlying down near Max, was soon asleep.  There was a drowsy influence in\r\nthe profound quiet, and subdued light of the spot, to which I should\r\nsoon have yielded but for Browne, who began to talk of Scottish scenes\r\nand legends, with sufficient interest to keep Morton and myself awake.\r\nIt seemed strange enough, to lie there in that tropical forest,\r\nlistening to an enthusiastic description of the rugged sublimity of the\r\nTrossachs, the romantic beauty of Loch Vennacher, Loch Katrine, and Loch\r\nAchray, or the lovely vale of Kelso, bosomed in green woods, with its\r\nplacid streams, smooth lawns, and hazel-fringed dells.\r\n\r\nAbout noon, Arthur and Eiulo made their appearance, emerging from the\r\ngrove to the south-east of the hill, laden with roots, plants, strips of\r\nbark, etcetera.  They had been looking for the auti, or paper-mulberry,\r\nbut without success.  Arthur had discovered a large and beautiful\r\nspecies of sweet-scented fern, with a tuberous root shaped like a\r\nsweet-potato, which he said was baked and eaten by the Society\r\nIslanders: he brought with him several entire specimens, root and all.\r\nThe leaves were fragrant and elegantly shaped, and the roots were of a\r\nmottled brown and yellow.  Eiulo carried in his hand an unripe\r\nbread-fruit--a splendid pea-green globe, nearly as big as his head.\r\nThey had discovered a noble grove of this most valuable tree, at no\r\ngreat distance from the hill, but the fruit was not yet perfectly ripe.\r\nJohnny, who had awaked at the return of the absentees, was greatly\r\ndelighted at these discoveries, and began to lament that he had not\r\naccompanied Arthur.  He inquired very particularly as to the direction\r\nof the bread-fruit grove, as if cherishing the design of setting out at\r\nonce to visit it; but Browne letting some thing drop about the voice in\r\nthe woods, Johnny changed the subject, and saying that it must be nearly\r\ndinner-time, proposed to make a fire, and bake the fern roots, so as to\r\ntest their quality.  Upon hearing this, Max, whose slumbers had also\r\nbeen disturbed, raised his head for a moment and exclaimed so vehemently\r\nagainst the very mention of a fire, when we were already dissolving with\r\nheat, that nothing further was said about it.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Arthur, after having given a full account of his\r\ndiscoveries, and answered all Johnny's questions, \"I believe it is just\r\nnoon, and while I think of it, I will try to ascertain our longitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ascertain our longitude!\" exclaimed Browne, \"pray, how do you propose\r\nto do that without instruments?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the longitude of the Kingsmill islands,\" answered Arthur, \"and\r\nif I can find our distance east or west of them, of course, I have the\r\nlongitude of this island.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there's the difficulty; how can you ascertain even whether we are\r\nto the east, or to the west of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, then, I have Kingsmill island time; my watch was\r\nlast set, one day while we were there, just after Mr Frazer had taken\r\nan observation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say,\" inquired I with some interest, \"that you have\r\nregularly wound up your watch every day since then, without once\r\nforgetting or neglecting it during all that has since occurred?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did regularly, every night before sleeping; and during all the time\r\nthat we were at sea in the boat, hardly a day passed that I did not note\r\ndown some memoranda in my pocket-book.\"\r\n\r\n\"That now, is positively diabolical!\" exclaimed Max, from his covert\r\namong the creepers, where he was completely invisible, except his heels,\r\nwhich were kicking in the air; \"I wouldn't have believed, Arthur, that\r\nyou were such a methodical, cold-blooded creature!  I suppose now, that\r\nif I had tumbled overboard during that hideous time, and been gulped\r\ndown by a shark, or if Shakespeare had starved to death, you would have\r\nmade a regular memorandum of the event, in business-like style, and\r\nwound up your watch as usual.  I think I see the entry in your\r\npocket-book, thus: `1839, June 3rd--Mem.  Max Adeler fell overboard this\r\nday, and was devoured by a shark--an amiable and interesting youth,\r\nthough too much given to levity, and not prepared, I fear, for so\r\nunexpected a summons.  June 5th--Mem.  My worthy and estimable friend,\r\nJohn Browne, late of Glasgow, Scotland, died this day, from lack of\r\nnecessary food.  Threw him overboard.  What startling monitions of the\r\nuncertainty of life!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace, Kaiser Maximilien, peace!\" cried Browne, \"and let the Professor\r\nproceed to fix our longitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first thing,\" resumed Arthur, \"is to plant a straight stick upright\r\nin the ground; when it casts no shadow east or west it is twelve o'clock\r\n_here_.  My watch will then show what time it is at the Kingsmills: if\r\nit shows an earlier hour there, we must be east of them; if a later\r\nhour, then we are west of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I understand that,\" said Johnny; \"the next thing is to tell how\r\nfar east or west we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite easy.  There are, you know, three hundred and sixty\r\ndegrees of longitude: the sun passes through them all--that is, round\r\nthe globe in twenty-four hours.  Then, of course, in one hour, it passes\r\nthrough fifteen degrees, and through one degree in four minutes; so that\r\nfor every four minutes' difference of time, there will be a difference\r\nof longitude of one degree--that is, near the equator, about seventy\r\nmiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be very near noon now,\" said Johnny, running out into a patch\r\nof sunshine, where a small opening in the grove let in the light, \"see!\r\nI have hardly any shadow at all.\"\r\n\r\nArthur planted a stick in the ground, and as soon as the shadow marked\r\nthe hour of noon, looked at his watch, by which it was eighteen minutes\r\nafter twelve.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem from this,\" said he, \"that we are four degrees and a\r\nhalf, or over three hundred miles, west of the Kingsmills: it also\r\nappears that we are very near the line, but a little south of it, for\r\nthe shadow inclines a little southward.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all nonsense,\" cried Max, sitting up in the grass, \"to pretend to\r\nascertain where we are, in any such way as this.  If your watch, (which\r\nyou know is a miserable time-keeper), has lost or gained but twenty\r\nminutes since we left the Kingsmills, which is now nearly two months,\r\nthen what becomes of your learned calculations about the difference of\r\ntime, and of the longitude, and all that?\"\r\n\r\nArthur laughed, and admitted that this grave impeachment of the\r\ncharacter of his chronometer, was not entirely without foundation, and\r\nthat in consequence, the strict accuracy of the results arrived at,\r\ncould not be relied on.\r\n\r\n\"The only thing that we can be at all certain about in regard to our\r\nposition,\" said Max, \"is, that we are south of the line.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can that be?\" inquired Browne, \"the Pole-star is visible from here,\r\nor, at any rate, we saw it on the second or third night we were at sea\r\nin the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"A part of the Great Bear can be seen,\" answered Arthur, \"but not the\r\nnorth star, I think.  I looked for it last night, and though I could see\r\nall the stars of the Dipper, the pointers were near the horizon, and the\r\nPole-star below it.  But even if visible, it would be no evidence that\r\nwe are north of the equator, for I believe it can be seen from the\r\nfourth or fifth degree of south latitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"See now,\" said Browne, \"what a pretty neighbourhood you are getting us\r\ninto, with your wise calculations!  If we are south of the line, and far\r\nwest of the Kingsmills, we must be somewhere near the Bidera Sea, and\r\nthe Mendana Archipelago, about which the young sailor Roby, who was\r\nalways boasting of having sailed with the famous Captain Morell, used to\r\ntell us such wonderful stories.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is good ground,\" replied Arthur, \"for one who wants to exercise a\r\ntraveller's privilege, and recount marvels and prodigies, without fear\r\nof contradiction.  Those seas are full of large islands, with countless\r\nnumbers of smaller ones, and remain to this day almost unexplored.  In\r\nfact, little more is now ascertained in regard to them, than was known\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years ago, soon after their discovery by the\r\nSpanish navigator Mendana; so that a man who pretends, as Roby does, to\r\nhave gone over the ground himself, may tell pretty much what stories he\r\npleases, without danger of any one being able to convict him of\r\ninaccuracy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Johnny, opening his eyes to their utmost extent, \"do\r\nyou suppose we are near those islands Jack Roby tells about, where the\r\nnatives chew betel and lime out of a carbo-gourd, and sacrifice men to\r\ntheir idols, and tear out and devour the hearts of their enemies?\"\r\n\r\n\"And where King Rogerogee lived,\" added Max, \"(you remember him Johnny),\r\nthe giant seven feet and a half high, who wore a paradise plume on his\r\nhead, and a girdle of the claws and beaks of birds around his waist?\r\nWhy, this may be the very island of Podee over which he reigned, and we\r\nought not to be greatly surprised to see him look in upon us at any\r\nmoment, with his paradise plume waving among the tops of the trees, and\r\nhis spear, eighteen feet long, in his hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let Rogerogee disturb your dreams, Johnny,\" said Arthur, \"if\r\nthere is any such place as the island of Podee, which I very much doubt,\r\nit is, according to Roby's own account, but a few leagues to the east of\r\nPapua, and some twelve or thirteen hundred miles at least, west of us.\"\r\n\r\nMax now got up, and after stretching himself, and giving three or four\r\ngreat yawns, came towards the spot where the rest of us were sitting;\r\nbut after taking a few steps, he suddenly stopped, uttering an\r\nexclamation of surprise, and looking down at something in the grass at\r\nhis feet.  He then kicked a dark object out of a tall bunch of fern,\r\ntowards us.  It was an old beaver hat crushed flat, and covered with\r\nmildew and dirt.  Robinson Crusoe was not more startled by the footprint\r\nin the sand, than were we at the sight of this unequivocal trace of\r\ncivilised man.  Arthur picked it up, and restoring it partially to its\r\nproper shape, examined the inside.  On the lining of the crown appeared\r\nin gilt letters--\r\n\r\nPIERRE BAUDIN,\r\n\r\nCHAPELIER,\r\n\r\nRUE RICHELIEU, NUMERO 20.\r\n\r\nA PARIS.\r\n\r\n\"Here, then,\" said Max, \"is an end of the notion that we are the first\r\ninhabitants of this island; it is clear that others have been, if they\r\nare not now upon it.  Perhaps, Johnny, this is the hat of the man you\r\nheard talking French in the woods this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate,\" said, Arthur, after a moment of thoughtful silence, \"this\r\nmust be the place where the Frenchman who perished in the water-spout\r\nand his companions, were cast away, and from which they afterwards\r\nreached Eiulo's island in a small boat.  The well yonder is probably\r\ntheir work, and we may perhaps find other evidences of their stay here,\r\nwhen we come to explore the island more thoroughly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nABOUT TEWA.\r\n\r\nA DULL CHAPTER, BUT NECESSARY--WAKATTA AND ATOLLO--A GENTLE HINT--MAX AS\r\nAN ARCHITECT.\r\n\r\n  \"In the forest hollow roaring,\r\n  Hark!  I hear a deepening sound,\r\n  Clouds rise thick with heavy lowering,\r\n  See! the horizon blackens round.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred from the occasional bursts of holiday humour, in\r\nwhich we indulged, that we had become reconciled to our exile, and were\r\nnow ready to subside into a state of indolent contentment satisfied with\r\nsecurity from present danger, and the abundant means of subsistence\r\nwhich we had discovered.\r\n\r\nNot even a tropical paradise, with its warm, glowing sky and balmy\r\natmosphere, its \"ambrosial fruits and amaranthine flowers,\" could charm\r\nus into oblivion of home, and those who made it dear; or diminish the\r\nbitterness of the thought of being cut off for ever from human\r\nintercourse, and of having all our plans of life deranged and\r\nfrustrated.  Though we did not brood continually over our unfortunate\r\nsituation, we were far from being insensible to it.  The loveliest\r\nisland that ever reposed in undiscovered beauty, upon the bosom of the\r\n\"blue summer ocean,\" though rich in all things necessary to supply every\r\nmaterial want, must still have seemed to us but as a gilded and\r\nluxurious prison, from which we should never cease to sigh for an\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nArthur's conclusion, mentioned at the end of the last chapter, seemed in\r\nitself so probable, and was confirmed by so many circumstances, that it\r\nwas readily adopted by us all; and believing that the party, of whose\r\npresence at one time upon the island the hat was an evidence, had left\r\nit years ago, the occurrence no longer appeared to possess any\r\nimportance, and we dismissed it altogether from our thoughts.\r\n\r\nEiulo, when questioned on the subject of the white men living among his\r\nown people, repeated substantially his former statement, that they came\r\nfrom an island lying south of his father's, and distant from it less\r\nthan a day's sail.  It seemed, also, that before the arrival of the\r\nwhites, an island lying in the direction from which they had come, had\r\nbeen known to some, at least, of the natives, and visited by them.  In\r\nthe course of the conversations which he had with Arthur, at various\r\ntimes, about his father's people and their affairs, Eiulo had often\r\nspoken of an old warrior, Wakatta by name, famous for his courage and\r\ngreat personal strength, of which he related many remarkable instances.\r\nThrough two generations he had been the most devoted and valued friend\r\nof the family of his chief; and upon his wisdom, sagacity, and prowess,\r\nEiulo's father and grandfather had relied in many an emergency, and\r\nseldom in vain.  Formerly, the three islands were independent of each\r\nother, and were ruled by separate chiefs, who sometimes engaged in\r\nsanguinary wars among themselves, in most of which Wakatta had played a\r\nprominent part.\r\n\r\nA great many moons ago, as Eiulo expressed it, the chiefs of the two\r\nsmaller islands had united their forces against his grandfather, who was\r\nthen chief of Tewa, the third and largest.  To this enterprise they had\r\nbeen incited by Atollo, an uncle of Eiulo, and younger brother of the\r\npresent chief, his father.  This man was possessed of great ability, and\r\nhis reputation as a warrior was second only to that of Wakatta, who was\r\nmany years his senior, so that among those of his own age he was\r\nconsidered without an equal.  But, though eminent for talent and\r\ncourage, he seemed to be entirely destitute of principle or feeling; and\r\nimpelled, as was supposed, by a spirit of unscrupulous ambition, (for no\r\nother motive could be assigned), this unnatural son plotted against the\r\nlives of his own father and elder brother.  His designs being\r\ndiscovered, and fully exposed, he fled to one of the neighbouring\r\nislands, and sought the protection of its chief, his father's most\r\nformidable and inveterate enemy.  Afterwards, by his address and energy,\r\nhe succeeded in bringing about a league between the chiefs of the two\r\nsmaller islands, for the purpose of an attack against Tewa, by their\r\ncombined forces.  The enterprise was planned with the greatest secrecy,\r\nand executed with equal skill and daring.  At midnight, the allies set\r\nsail, in a fleet of war canoes, and two hours before dawn they had\r\ndisembarked at Tewa, marched to the principal village, where the chief\r\nresided, and made all their dispositions for the attack, which was so\r\ntotally unexpected, that it was crowned with complete success.  Scarcely\r\nany resistance was made: the principal Tewan warriors were slain in\r\ntheir beds, or taken prisoners; and Eiulo's father and grandfather, with\r\nWakatta, only saved their lives by fleeing to the mountains.  Knowing\r\nthat the strictest search would be made for them, and that if taken,\r\ninstant death would be their doom; they stole forth from their\r\nlurking-place by night, repaired to the beach, and taking a large canoe,\r\nwhich they discovered there, set sail in her, steering boldly southward,\r\nin search of a considerable island which was believed to lie in that\r\ndirection.  Soon after sunrise they came in sight of land, but, on\r\napproaching it, they found that the surf was bursting with great fury\r\nupon a barrier reef, stretching between them and the shore; and it was\r\nnot until they had coasted along it for many hours, that they succeeded\r\nin effecting a landing.  Eiulo had heard both his father and Wakatta\r\nspeak of the island as a singularly beautiful spot, nearly as large as\r\nTewa, and abounding in bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees.  Here the\r\nfugitives remained for several months, until, becoming wearied of their\r\nsolitary life, and possessed by an irresistible longing to revisit their\r\nhomes, they came to the determination to venture back, and learn the\r\nstate of things there, at every hazard.  They accordingly set sail one\r\nday at noon, in order that they might reach their destination under\r\ncover of night, in which they succeeded.\r\n\r\nSeeking a temporary place of concealment in the woods, they seized\r\nfavourable opportunities to discover themselves to some friends, on whom\r\nthey could rely.  They learned that the victorious allies had been\r\nguilty of the most intolerable cruelty towards the people of Tewa.  Many\r\nof the prisoners had been slain, as sacrifices to the gods, and many\r\nmore had been made slaves.  Atollo had established himself as chief at\r\nthe conquered island, and had gathered about him a band of the most\r\nferocious and desperate men, who practised every species of cruelty and\r\noppression upon the inhabitants.  The latter, driven to the utmost verge\r\nof endurance, were now ready to incur any risk in an attempt to deliver\r\nthemselves from a yoke so galling.  They needed only a leader, and the\r\nexperience and prowess of Wakatta, together with the presence of their\r\nancient and rightful chief and his son, inspired them with confidence\r\nand courage.  Gathering a small, but resolute, band of warriors, they\r\nawaited the favourable moment to strike a decisive blow; and then,\r\nemulating the secrecy and suddenness of Atollo's recent enterprise, they\r\nsallied forth at night, from their rendezvous in the forest and fell\r\nupon him and his adherents.  Wakatta was unable to restrain the ferocity\r\nof his followers, excited by the insults and injuries they had suffered,\r\nand they killed on the spot all who fell into their hands, pausing to\r\nmake no prisoners.  Atollo, after fighting like a tiger, though almost\r\nalone, succeeded in making his escape with a few of his attendants.  The\r\nvictors promptly carried the war into the neighbouring islands, both of\r\nwhich were completely subdued, and afterwards remained under the sway of\r\nEiulo's grandfather until his death, when the present chief succeeded.\r\nAtollo, after resisting as long as there remained the slightest prospect\r\nof success, had sought refuge among the recesses of the mountains, where\r\nhe still lurked with a few outlaw followers, as desperate as himself.\r\nHis father had forbidden any search for him, or any efforts for his\r\ncapture to be made; and such was the dread inspired by his desperate\r\ncourage, ferocity, and cunning, and such the superstitious terror with\r\nwhich he was generally regarded, that few felt any inclination to\r\ntransgress this command, or to meddle in any way with him or his\r\nfollowers; and he was consequently left unmolested in his favourite\r\nhaunts, among the wild and almost inaccessible precipices of the\r\ninterior.  In seasons of scarcity, his father had even caused supplies\r\nof food to be placed where they would be likely to fall in his way.\r\nEiulo always shuddered when he spoke of this man.  Once, when\r\naccompanied by a young playmate and an attendant, he had strayed a long\r\nway into the wood in search of wild-flowers, and had, without being\r\naware of it, approached the region frequented by the outlaws, a spear\r\nhad suddenly been hurled at him from an adjacent thicket, with so deadly\r\na purpose, that it whistled past within a few inches of his side.  As\r\nthey fled in alarm, and were clambering hastily down a steep descent, a\r\nmass of rock was disengaged from the verge of an overhanging precipice,\r\nand came near crushing them all.  Looking back, in their flight, they\r\nsaw a wild figure, which the attendant recognised at once as that of\r\nEiulo's uncle, stooping at the edge of the cliff, in the act of\r\nloosening another large stone.  Notwithstanding this murderous attempt,\r\nthe present chief of Tewa continued to pursue the same forbearing course\r\nwhich his father had adopted, and Atollo was still permitted to remain\r\nunmolested among his mountain fastnesses.\r\n\r\nEiulo, even before the discovery of the hat, had believed that we were\r\nupon the same island which his father had visited, as above related, and\r\nfrom which the whites had afterwards come.  He was confident that by\r\nsailing northward, with a fair wind, we should reach Tewa in less than a\r\nday.  Though generally cheerful, and overflowing with boyish spirits,\r\nthere were times when it was apparent that he pined for his home; and,\r\nthough he never directly urged it, he earnestly wished to have us make\r\nthe attempt to reach his father's island in the yawl.\r\n\r\nAt length I began to suspect, from the constant and minute inquiries\r\nwhich Arthur made in relation to Tewa, and its people, their usages,\r\nhabits, etcetera, that he was thinking seriously of some such attempt.\r\nHe directed his inquiries particularly to the point whether the island\r\nwas ever visited by ships.  Eiulo remembered hearing his father speak of\r\nbig canoes, without any outriggers, and whose masts were as high as a\r\ncocoa-nut-tree, having passed in sight of the island.  He had heard,\r\ntoo, that a long while ago, one of these great vessels had got aground,\r\nupon a reef between Tewa and the adjacent island, and that the natives\r\nhad gone off to her in their canoes, and some of them had ventured on\r\nboard at the invitation of the strangers.  Old Wakatta was one of these,\r\nand he had received a wonderful present from the white chief, which he\r\nhad often exhibited to Eiulo, and which, from his description of it,\r\nappeared to be neither more nor less than a small looking-glass.  The\r\ngreat canoe had, by throwing overboard a part of her cargo, got off from\r\nthe reef at the rising of the tide, and resumed her voyage.  It was\r\npretty evident that the arrival of a European vessel at the islands, was\r\nan event of very rare occurrence, and in all probability the result of\r\nmere accident.  Except that he steadily pursued inquiries of this kind,\r\nArthur said nothing to show that he entertained the thought of such an\r\nundertaking as I suspected him to be revolving.  Browne and Morton both\r\nhad exaggerated notions of the cruelty and treachery of the \"heathen\r\nnative;\" as the former called them, and would, I had no doubt, be\r\nstrongly averse to any step calculated to place us in their power,\r\nunless it should also, in some way, increase our prospects of ultimately\r\ngetting home.\r\n\r\nFor several days after the occurrences narrated in the last chapter, we\r\nremained at Castle-hill, making little excursions daily in various\r\ndirections.  Having now discovered a supply of fresh water, and abundant\r\nmeans of subsistence, it seemed as though there was at present nothing\r\nfurther for us to do, except to assist Arthur, as far as we could; in\r\nhis preparations for manufacturing tappa.  The weather was so genial,\r\n(except during the middle of the day, when the heat was frequently\r\nintolerable), that we felt no want of any other shelter than such as the\r\ngrove afforded us.  Generally, towards evening, a refreshing breeze set\r\nin from the sea, and lasted several hours.  We experienced no bad\r\neffects from sleeping in the open air, and far from finding it a\r\nhardship, we soon came to consider it every way more pleasant, than to\r\nbe cribbed and cabined within four close walls.  There was something\r\ndelightful, in dropping off into dreamland, listening to the whispering\r\nof the leaves above you, and catching glimpses through them, of a sky so\r\ndeliciously blue, and stars so wonderfully bright.  It seemed as though\r\nin this favoured spot, the fable of a perpetual summer was to be\r\nrealised, and the whole circle of the year was to be crowned with the\r\nsame freshness and verdure and beauty, the same profusion of fruits and\r\nflowers, which we had thus far enjoyed.  But such expectations, if any\r\nof us were beguiled into entertaining them, were destined to be rudely\r\ndissipated.  One hot afternoon, we were startled from a drowsy siesta in\r\nthe grove, by a peal of thunder, such as is rarely heard in temperate\r\nclimates, and on springing up and looking about us, we beheld above and\r\naround us, certain indications, which it would have been far more\r\ninteresting and agreeable to contemplate from beneath the shelter of a\r\nsnug and comfortable dwelling.  The wind moaned through the bending\r\ntree-tops; the face of the heavens was black as night, and the waters of\r\nthe lagoon, and of the ocean, had darkened to a steely blue beneath\r\ntheir frown.  Before we had fairly shaken off our drowsiness, another\r\nabrupt peal of thunder burst overhead, with a suddenness that seemed to\r\njar the very clouds and shake the water out of them, for the rain began\r\nall at once to come down violently, in big drops, that rattled like\r\nhailstones upon the crisp leaves of the forest.  The thunder appeared to\r\nhave completed its office in giving the signal for the clouds to\r\ndischarge their contents, and we heard it no more.  For a time, the\r\ndense foliage of the large tree under which we gathered, completely\r\nsheltered us; but soon the moisture began to drip slowly from the lower\r\nleaves, and occasionally fell in sudden showers, as the branches were\r\nshaken by the wind.\r\n\r\nAt length, the ground became thoroughly saturated, shallow puddles\r\nformed in every little hollow or depression, and there was the prospect\r\nof a most miserable night if the storm should continue.  Happily, this\r\ndid not prove to be the case; in about an hour after we had been aroused\r\nby the first thunder peal, the clouds dispersed almost as suddenly as\r\nthey had gathered; the sun shone forth brightly; the trees and the grass\r\nsparkled with raindrops, lustrous as diamonds, and the whole landscape\r\nsmiled in fresher beauty than ever.\r\n\r\nThis little occurrence, however, served as a seasonable hint to recall\r\nto our minds the importance of contriving some kind of a dwelling to\r\nafford us shelter in bad weather, and we resolved to lose no time in\r\nsetting about it.  Accordingly, the day following that of the thunder\r\nshower, as soon as we had returned from the beach, after taking our\r\nregular morning swim, Arthur called a council, to deliberate and\r\ndetermine upon the matter of house-building.  The first thing was to fix\r\nupon a site; the only objection to the level space at the top of the\r\nhill, was its elevated position, exposing it to the full force of the\r\nviolent winds which prevail at certain periods of the tropical year.\r\nBut on that side from which the strongest winds blow, the spot was\r\nprotected by still higher land towards the interior, and the fine trees\r\nof various kinds and sizes, (some of them evidently the growth of many\r\nyears), among which could be seen no prostrate trunks, showed, as we\r\nthought, that nothing was to be feared from that source.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, selected a smooth, open space, near the edge of the\r\nterrace, commanding a view of the sea, through a vista of noble trees.\r\nMax insisted, that, inasmuch as with our limited architectural resources\r\nwe could not make our house of more than one storey, we ought to build\r\nin \"cottage style,\" and make up for deficiency in height, by spreading\r\nover a large surface.  He then proceeded to mark out a ground-plan, upon\r\na scale that would have been shockingly extravagant, had we been in a\r\npart of the world where the price of building-lots was to be taken into\r\nconsideration.  A parallelogram, nearly forty feet long by twenty-five\r\nin width, the narrower side fronting the sea, was the plan of the main\r\nbuilding.  This was to be flanked by two wings, each some sixteen feet\r\nsquare, which would serve to strengthen and support the principal\r\nstructure.  \"Upon this model,\" Max complacently observed, \"he intended\r\none of these days to build his country-seat, near Mount Merino, on the\r\nHudson: meantime, we were welcome to the benefit of the idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, we're greatly obliged to you, Max,\" said Browne, \"for helping\r\nus so generously through with the most difficult part of the business.\r\nAll that we now want in order to finish it at once, is merely a few\r\nloads of joist, plank, pine-boards, shingles, and window-sash; a supply\r\nof nails, a set of carpenter's tools, and a couple of carpenters to use\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" rejoined Max, \"we shall want a supply of building\r\nmaterials, tools, etcetera, and I am expecting them along daily.  We\r\nhave now been here several weeks, and it is quite time, in the natural\r\nand regular course of things, and according to the uniform experience of\r\npeople situated as we are, for a ship heavily laden, (say in our case),\r\nwith lumber and hardware, to be driven upon our shores in the midst of a\r\nterrible storm, (yesterday, when it began to thunder, I thought it was\r\nat hand).  The ship will come driving upon the reef--the crew will take\r\nto the boats, but no boat can live in such a sea, and notwithstanding\r\nour humane and daring efforts to assist them, all perish among the\r\nbreakers--that is to say, all except the carpenter--whom I rescue, by\r\nplunging into the raging flood and dragging him ashore by the hair, just\r\nas he is about sinking for the third time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobly done!\" said Browne, \"but couldn't you at the same time manage to\r\nsave a drowning washerwoman? she would be as great an acquisition as the\r\ncarpenter, in my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"At length,\" resumed Max, \"the storm abates--the sea becomes smooth--we\r\ngo out in the yawl to the stranded vessel, where she lies upon a coral\r\npatch, and bring off, in two boat loads, the carpenter's chest, a keg of\r\ngunpowder, a blunderbuss, seven muskets, fourteen pairs of pistols, and\r\na bag of doubloons, (think of that, Johnny!)  That very night the wind\r\nrises again: the surf breaks the wreck to pieces, and washes the\r\nfragments ashore, and in the morning the sea is strewn far and wide with\r\nfloating spars, and bales, and barrels; and the reef is covered for\r\nmiles with `joist, plank, pine-boards, shingles, window-sash,' and\r\nwhatever other trifling conveniences are requisite for building my\r\ncottage.  This is what Johnny and I confidently calculate upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime,\" said Arthur, \"in case by any unfortunate accident\r\nyour ship should fail to arrive in time to enable us to get the cottage\r\nup before the rains set in, I propose that we commence a less ambitious\r\nstructure.\"  He began to trace upon the ground with a pointed stick, the\r\noval outline of what he called a `Tihitian fare.'  \"But even for my\r\nfare,\" he added, \"we shall need the means of cutting down a number of\r\ngood-sized trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of which we are entirely destitute,\" said Max, with an air of triumph,\r\n\"and I don't see but that we shall have to wait for my ship after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" answered Arthur, \"for I think that two or three of the\r\ncutlasses may be converted into tolerable saws, with which, by dint of a\r\nlittle patience, we can get out as many posts and rafters as will be\r\nrequisite for the frame of our building, though I admit it will be\r\ntedious work.\"\r\n\r\nJohnny heaved a profound sigh at the prospect of the difficulties that\r\nlay in the way of his pet project of house-building, and wished that\r\n\"that old magician who built the castle with a thousand windows for\r\nAladdin, in a single night, would only be clever enough to lend us his\r\nassistance.\"  But upon second thought, he concluded that there would be\r\n\"no fun\" in having our house ready-made for us, and magnanimously\r\ndeclared that if he had the wonderful lamp in his hands that minute,\r\nwith full power to summon up the obedient genius, and set him to work,\r\nhe would not do it.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you would make him supply us with a few good axes, Johnny, at\r\nleast,\" said Browne.\r\n\r\nBut Johnny was disposed to be very self-denying and high-minded; he did\r\nnot think he ought to do it; we should take a great deal more pleasure\r\nin our house if we made it ourselves, without any magical assistance of\r\nany kind.\r\n\r\n\"Now, that you mention axes,\" said Morton, \"it occurs to me that there\r\nis an old hatchet-head among the rubbish in the locker of the yawl, and\r\nthough it is a good deal battered and worn, it could be fitted with a\r\nhandle and made useful.\"\r\n\r\nWe all now remembered having seen it, though no one had before thought\r\nof it.  Arthur suggested that we should make an excursion to Palm-Islet\r\nas soon as the heat of the day was over, and the sea-breeze had set in,\r\nfor the purpose of getting the hatchet, and bringing the boat round to\r\nthe side of the island where we intended to fix our residence, as we\r\nmight have occasion for its use.  \"We can get there before dark,\" said\r\nhe, \"and pass the night once more at our old quarters on the little\r\nisland; then we can row back in the fresh of the morning, before\r\nsunrise, and be ready to commence our building in earnest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE CORAL REEF.\r\n\r\nJOHNNY AND THE CHAMA--AMATEUR PEARL-DIVING--A SHARK BLOCKADE--CULINARY\r\nGENIUS.\r\n\r\n  \"Down in the depths of the lonely sea,\r\n  I work at my mystic masonry;\r\n  I've crusted the plants of the deep with stone,\r\n  And given them colouring not their own;\r\n  And now o'er the ocean fields they spread\r\n  Their fan-like branches of white and red:\r\n  Oh! who can fashion a work like me,\r\n  The mason of God, in the boundless sea.\"\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon, when the slanting beams of the sun began to lose\r\ntheir fierceness, and the heat was tempered by the breeze setting in\r\nfrom the ocean, we descended to the beach, and set out for the eastern\r\nside of the island, in accordance with Arthur's suggestion, mentioned at\r\nthe close of the last chapter.  As we made our way across Sea-bird's\r\nPoint, the clamorous cries of the gannets, raising their harsh voices to\r\nthe highest pitch, in angry remonstrance against this invasion of their\r\ndomain, were almost deafening.  They might well be alarmed for the\r\nsafety of their nests--or rather of their eggs, which they lay upon the\r\nbare ground, without any attempt at a nest--for they strewed the whole\r\npoint so thickly that it was no easy matter to pick one's way without\r\ntreading upon them at every alternate step.  In nearly every tree were\r\nto be seen the rude nests of the frigate-bird, built of a few coarse\r\nsticks; and numbers of the birds themselves, with their singular\r\nblood-red pouches inflated to the utmost extent, were flying in from the\r\nsea.  The large sooty tern, the graceful tropic bird, and the spruce,\r\nfierce-looking man-of-war's hawk, with his crimson bill, and black\r\nflashing eye, flew familiarly around us, frequently coming so near, that\r\nwe could easily have knocked them down with our cutlasses, had we been\r\ninclined to abuse, so wantonly, the confidence which they seemed to\r\nrepose in us.\r\n\r\nWhen half-way across the point, I came suddenly upon a magnificent male\r\ntropic bird, sitting in his nest behind a tussock of tall, reedy grass.\r\nHe did not offer to quit his post, even when the others approached very\r\nnear, and paused to admire him; being apparently engaged, in the absence\r\nof his mate, in attending to certain domestic duties, generally supposed\r\nto belong more appropriately to her.  He was somewhat larger than a\r\npigeon, and was a very beautiful bird, though not so brilliantly\r\ncoloured as several other species of sea-fowl.  His plumage, soft and\r\nlustrous as satin, was of a delicate pearly grey, except the long\r\nmiddle-feathers of the tail, which were of a pale red, and projected\r\nfull a foot and a half beyond the rest.  He manifested not the slightest\r\nfear, even when Johnny stooped and stroked his glossy coat.  Just as we\r\nleft the spot, the partner of this exemplary bird arrived, and hastened\r\nto relieve him from duty, giving him notice to quit, by two or three\r\nquick, impatient chirps, and a playful peck upon the head, whereupon he\r\nresigned his place, into which the other immediately settled, with a\r\nsoft, complacent, cooing note, as expressive of perfect content as the\r\npurring of a well-fed tabby, stretched cosily upon the earth-rug before\r\na cheerful winter evening fire.  This transfer was effected so quickly,\r\nthat Johnny was baffled in an ill-bred attempt which he made to pry into\r\nthe domestic concerns of the affectionate pair, and he could not get\r\neven a transient glimpse of the contents of the nest.\r\n\r\nWithout permitting ourselves to be tempted into any further deviation or\r\ndelay, we kept steadily along the beach, until we arrived, a little\r\nbefore sunset, at the spot where the yawl lay, drawn up on the sand,\r\nopposite the islet.\r\n\r\nMax declared that after our long march, we ought to have a supper\r\nconsisting of something more substantial than cocoa-nuts, and proposed\r\nthat we should pull over to the reef, and procure some shell-fish, which\r\nproposition meeting with general approval, we got the boat into the\r\nwater, and in five minutes reached the inside of the ledge, and landed\r\nupon it at a point about a quarter of a mile from the opening, through\r\nwhich we had first entered the lagoon.  In this place, it was some\r\nfifteen or twenty yards in width, and consisted of a seamed and broken\r\nflat of dead coral, elevated but slightly above the level of the sea.\r\nThough there was no wind, and had been none during the day, the mighty\r\nbillows of the open ocean came rolling in upon the outer edge of the\r\nreef with their accustomed violence.  The action of the trade-winds is\r\nupon the whole so steady and uniform, that when it does cease for short\r\nperiods, its effects continue, and upon the windward side of these\r\ncoral-belted islands, there are breakers that never cease to rage, even\r\nin the calmest weather.  No sight could be more grand and imposing, than\r\nthat of these enormous waves encountering the reef.  One of them would\r\nsometimes extend along it a mile, or a mile and a half, in an unbroken\r\nline.  As it sweeps onward, with a slow and majestic movement towering\r\nup, like a dark-blue mountain, it seems as if nothing could resist its\r\npower, and you almost tremble lest the solid barrier upon which you\r\nstand should be hurled from its foundations.  It meets the curving line\r\nof the reef with a tremendous concussion, and thus suddenly arrested by\r\nthe parapet of coral, reared from the depths of the sea, it rises at\r\nonce, throughout its entire length, to the height of twelve or fifteen\r\nfeet perpendicularly, and stands for a moment as if congealed in its\r\nprogress; then breaking with a hollow roar, it falls in a deluge of foam\r\nand spray, filling all the seams and crevices, and marking their course\r\nin lines of white upon the dark ground of the ledge.  Not the least\r\nstriking feature of the spectacle, was the multitude of fishes, of all\r\nshapes, colours, and sizes, that could be seen suspended in the face of\r\nthis liquid wall, the very moment before it fell.  How they escaped\r\nbeing thrown upon the reef seemed inexplicable, but they darted hither\r\nand thither at the very edge of the roller, with the greatest apparent\r\nease and security, and almost invariably turned sea-ward just in time to\r\nsave themselves.  Occasionally, however, some careless or unskilful\r\nindividual, not sufficiently versed in this perilous kind of navigation,\r\nsuffered shipwreck, and was left gasping and floundering upon the coral.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged in watching the bursting of the waves upon the reef,\r\nI suddenly heard Johnny at a little distance calling out lustily for\r\nhelp, and hastening to the spot, I found him in one of the yawning\r\ncrevices of the coral rock, up to his neck in water, and struggling\r\nviolently to get out, in which he seemed to meet with opposition from\r\nsome object in the hole.\r\n\r\n\"Something has got me by the feet,\" he cried, as soon as he saw me; \"it\r\nis an enormous oyster, or a shell-fish of some kind, and it pinches\r\ndreadfully.\"\r\n\r\nI looked down into the water, and saw what in fact, seemed to be a\r\ngigantic shell-fish, gripping both his legs: it retained its hold so\r\ntenaciously, that I found I could not extricate him, and when Arthur\r\ncame up, as he did in a moment, it was as much as we could both do, to\r\nlift him and his singular captor, which still clung obstinately to him,\r\nout of the crevice.  We were then obliged to pry open the shells with\r\nour cutlasses before we could release him.\r\n\r\nArthur pronounced this extraordinary shell-fish, to be a specimen of the\r\n\"Chama Gigas.\"  The shells were nearly three feet in length, and\r\ncuriously marked and clouded.  Johnny had slipped from the slimy edge of\r\nthe chasm, and happened to fall fairly into the expanded jaws of the\r\nchama, which, had instantly closed upon him.  If the water had been\r\ndeeper, the consequences might have been serious, as there are instances\r\nof persons being drowned, by having their feet caught in the vice-like\r\ngrip of this formidable bivalve.\r\n\r\nNot far from the scene of Johnny's mishap, was a green spot upon the\r\nreef, where a group of young trees seemed to spring up out of the bare\r\ncoral.  On approaching the place, we found that a little island, about\r\nthe size of Palm-islet was there in process of formation.\r\nNotwithstanding the exposed and barren character of the locality, and\r\nthe scantiness of the soil, which was not anywhere a foot in depth.  It\r\nwas covered with a thrifty vegetation, among which were several\r\nwell-grown-palms, a group of young casuarinas, and some ferns and\r\ntournefortias.  Nor was this embryo islet destitute of inhabitants.  The\r\ntrees were at this hour filled with aquatic birds, and I observed among\r\nthem one remarkable species, long-bodied, and slender, like swallows,\r\nwith red bills and feet, white breast, and slate-coloured wings; these,\r\ninstead of perching, like the rest of their feathered associates, upon\r\nthe trees, nestled in the concavity of the long palm-leaves, far enough\r\nfrom the stem, to be rocked gently by the undulating motion of the leaf,\r\nwhich a breath of wind, or the slightest stirring of the birds in these\r\nswinging nets was sufficient to produce.  But by far the most numerous\r\nand singular portion of the population of the islet, consisted of a\r\nspecies of large land-crab, inhabiting burrows hollowed out beneath the\r\nroots of the trees.  Great numbers of them appeared to be bathing or\r\nsporting in the shallow water on the lagoon side of the islet, but, at\r\nsight of us, they scrambled off to their burrows with a degree of\r\nagility that could hardly have been expected from such clumsy-looking\r\ncreatures.  Owing partly to this unlooked-for rapidity of locomotion,\r\nand partly to a natural shyness and hesitation which we felt about\r\nhandling them rashly, (their pincer-like jaws, with half a dozen pairs\r\nof which each individual seemed to be provided, having a rather\r\nformidable appearance), they escaped before we could capture even a\r\nspecimen.  Johnny forthwith posted himself in ambush among a bunch of\r\nfern, and riveting his eyes upon one of the burrows at the foot of a\r\nyoung cocoa-nut tree, waited impatiently for the crabs to venture forth\r\nonce more.  In a few moments a patriarchal-looking old fellow emerged\r\ncautiously from the hole, and was presently followed by several more.\r\nJohnny prudently delayed any hostile movement, until they should get far\r\nenough from their place of security to enable him to cut off their\r\nretreat; and, in the meantime, I was greatly amused and interested in\r\nobserving the ingenious method, in which the patriarch commenced\r\noperating upon a cocoa-nut, which had fallen to the ground near his den.\r\n\r\nManaging his complicated apparatus of claws with surprising dexterity,\r\nhe seized the nut, and stripped off the outer husk in a twinkling; then\r\nsetting it upon one end, he began to hammer away at the orifices through\r\nwhich the stalk and root of the future tree make their way when the nut\r\ngerminates.  Having at length removed the filling up of these orifices,\r\nhe inserted a claw, and actually split the strong inner shell, dividing\r\nit neatly into halves.  At this stage of the proceedings, half a dozen\r\ngreedy neighbours, who had been looking on, without offering a helping\r\nclaw, shuffled nimbly forward to share the spoil, and it was curious to\r\nsee how quickly they cleaned out the shell, leaving not a particle of\r\nthe kernel.  Johnny seized this as a favourable moment for a sally, and\r\nrushed forth cutlass in hand, having adopted the discreet resolution of\r\ndisabling them, by lopping off those formidable claws, before coming to\r\nclose quarters.  The sally, however, was premature, and proved entirely\r\nunsuccessful, for the crabs backed and sidled into their burrows with\r\nsuch expedition, that the last of them disappeared before their\r\nassailant could get within reach.  Leaving Johnny to renew his\r\nambuscade, if so disposed, I proceeded along the reef, and found Max and\r\nBrowne bathing for the second time that day.  They had discovered a\r\ncharming place for the purpose, where a kind of oval basin was formed by\r\nthe lagoon setting into the inside of the reef.  The water was deep and\r\nclear, so that there was no danger of wounding the feet by means of\r\nshells or corals.  Max had discovered what he supposed to be an enormous\r\npearl-oyster, attached to a wall of coral, at the depth of five or six\r\nfathoms, and they were diving for it alternately.  Both succeeded in\r\nreaching it, but it adhered so firmly to the rock by its strong beard,\r\nthat neither of the amateur pearl-divers could tear it off, and getting\r\nsoon exhausted and out of breath, they abandoned the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe submarine scenery of the lagoon was in this spot unusually varied\r\nand beautiful, and the basin formed a bath, fit for the Nereids\r\nthemselves.  Numbers of different kinds of shell-fish were attached to\r\nthe coral branches, or wedged into their interstices.  Others were\r\nfeeding, and reflected the brightest colours with every motion.  Purple\r\nmullet, variegated rock-fish, and small ray-fish, were darting about\r\nnear the bottom.  Another species of mullet, of a splendid changeable\r\nblue and green, seemed to be feeding upon the little polyps protruding\r\nfrom the coral tops.  Shells, sea-plants, coral, and fishes, and the\r\nslightest movement of the latter, even to the vibration of a tiny fin!\r\nor the gentle opening of the gills in respiration, could be seen with\r\nperfect distinctness in this transparent medium.  But what chiefly\r\nattracted attention, was the gay tints, and curious shapes, of the\r\ninnumerable zoophytes, or \"flower animals,\" springing up from the sides\r\nand bottom of the basin, and unfolding their living leaves above their\r\nlimestone trunks or stems which encased them.  Blue, red, pink, orange,\r\npurple, and green, were among the colours, and the variety of patterns\r\nseemed absolutely endless: they mimicked, in their manner of growth, the\r\nfoliage of trees, the spreading antlers of the stag, globes, columns,\r\nstars, feathery plumes, trailing vines, and all the wildest and most\r\ngraceful forms of terrestrial vegetation.  Nothing was wanting to\r\ncomplete this submarine shrubbery, even to the minutest details; there\r\nwere mosses, and ferns, and lichens, and spreading shrubs, and branching\r\ntrees; bunches of slender thread-like stems, swaying gently with the\r\nmotion of the water, might, (except for their pale, purplish, tint),\r\npass for rushes, or tussocks of reedy grass; and it required no effort\r\nof the imagination to see fancifully shaped wild-flowers in the numerous\r\nvarieties of actiniae, or sea anemones, many of which bore the closest\r\nresemblance to wood-pinks, asters, and carnations.  The imitations of\r\nthese flowers were in some cases wonderfully perfect, even to their\r\ndelicate petals, which were represented by the slender, fringe-like\r\ntentacles of the living polyp, protruding from its cell.  Besides these\r\ncounterparts of land vegetation, there were waving sea-fans, solid\r\nmasses of sponge-coral, clubs of Hercules, madrepores, like\r\nelegantly-formed vases filled with flowers, dome-like groups of\r\nastraeae, studded with green and purple spangles, and a thousand other\r\nshapes, so fantastic and peculiar, that they can be likened to no other\r\nobjects in nature.\r\n\r\nJohnny having got tired of lying in wait for the crabs, came to watch\r\nthe swimmers and search for shells.  In the course of frequent beach\r\nexcursions with Mr Frazer, he had picked up the names, and chief\r\ndistinguishing characteristics of the principal genera of marine shells,\r\nin consequence of which he had at length come to regard himself as quite\r\na conchologist, and was ambitious of making a \"collection,\" like other\r\nnaturalists, in which design Arthur encouraged and assisted him.\r\n\r\nJoining me, where I was lying upon a flat ledge, peering down into the\r\nbasin, he presently espied a Triton's trumpet, more than a foot in\r\nlength, in some five fathoms of water, and pointing it out to Max, he\r\nbegged him to dive for it, earnestly assuring him that he had never seen\r\nso fine a specimen of the \"Murex Tritonica.\"  But the latter very\r\ndecidedly declined sacrificing his breath in the cause of science,\r\ndeclaring that he had completely exhausted himself by his exertions in\r\npearl-diving.\r\n\r\nEiulo coming up at the moment with a number of shell-fish which he had\r\nobtained, Johnny appealed to him for aid, and not in vain, for as soon\r\nas the much-coveted shell was pointed out to him, he threw off his\r\nwrapper, and plunging into the water, almost instantly returned with it.\r\nMax now showed him the supposed pearl-oyster, and challenged him to\r\nmake an attempt to bring it up.  Eiulo laughed, and nodded his\r\nacceptance of the challenge: after pausing a moment to take breath, he\r\ndived perpendicularly downward, reaching the shell easily with a few\r\nstrokes, and made one or two vigorous but ineffectual jerks at it; then,\r\njust as I thought him about to give it up, and ascend again, he grasped\r\nit with both hands, brought his feet under him, and bracing himself\r\nfirmly against the wall of coral, he wrenched it off, and bore the prize\r\nin triumph to the surface.  It proved to be a pearl-oyster, as Max had\r\nsupposed, and on being opened was found to contain eleven seed-pearls.\r\nEiulo presented the shell and its contents to Johnny, who seemed to\r\nvalue the former, quite as much as the latter, and presently ran off in\r\nsearch of Arthur, to inquire whether it should properly be classed with\r\nthe \"genus ostrea,\" or the \"genus mytilus.\"\r\n\r\nAfter watching the swimmers a little longer, I strolled along the reef,\r\nin the direction which Johnny had taken in pursuit of Arthur, stopping\r\noccasionally to watch the bursting of a wave of uncommon magnitude, or\r\nto examine some of the interesting objects that were strewn with such\r\nprofusion in every direction, and which rendered that barren ledge so\r\nchoice a spot for the studies of the naturalist.  Some ten or fifteen\r\nminutes had been thus employed, and it was beginning to grow dark, so\r\nthat Arthur and Johnny, whom I had not yet overtaken, could be but just\r\ndistinguished, like two specks in the distance, when I heard the\r\npowerful voice of Browne, raised in a loud and prolonged halloo.\r\nPausing to listen, I soon heard the cry repeated, in a manner that\r\nshowed as I thought, that something unusual had taken place.  Hastening\r\nback, I found that Max and Browne had swum off to a coral knoll, in the\r\nlagoon, a stone's throw from the reef, and dared not venture back, being\r\nclosely blockaded by a large fish swimming about near the spot, which\r\nthey supposed to be a shark.  They called loudly for me to come after\r\nthem in the boat, and to lose no time about it, as there was water\r\nenough on the knoll, to enable a shark, if tolerably enterprising, to\r\nreach them where they stood.  Though it was rapidly getting dark, there\r\nwas still sufficient light to enable me to distinguish an enormous fish\r\nof some kind, cruising back and forth, with the regularity of a sentinel\r\non duty, between the reef, and the shallow where Max and Browne were\r\nstanding up to their knees in water.  The case appeared to admit of no\r\ndelay, and jumping into the boat, I pulled over to the coral patch with\r\nall possible speed, passing the fish close enough to see that it was in\r\nfact a large shark, and he proved also to be an exceedingly fierce and\r\nravenous one.  It almost seemed as though he understood my errand, for\r\nhe followed, or rather attended me, closely, keeping so near the bow of\r\nthe boat that it was with great difficulty and some danger, that I at\r\nlength got the blockaded swimmers aboard.  When this was effected, his\r\ndisappointment and consequent bad temper were quite apparent; he swam\r\nround and round the boat in the most disturbed and agitated manner as we\r\nreturned, making a variety of savage demonstrations, and finally going\r\nso far as to snap spitefully at the oars, which he did not discontinue,\r\nuntil Browne had two or three times rapped him smartly over the nose.\r\nAfter landing in safety, Max pelted him with shells and pieces of coral\r\nrock, until he finally swam off.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Arthur and Johnny had returned from their wandering along the\r\nreef; the latter had come across another colony of crabs, and had\r\nsucceeded in capturing three of them, or rather two and a half, for\r\nhaving, as he fondly imagined, disabled one enormous fellow by hacking\r\nhim in two with his cutlass, the one half had scrambled into the hole,\r\nwhile Johnny was securing the other.\r\n\r\nWe now placed the chama shells, the crabs, and other shell-fish,\r\ntogether with Johnny's specimens, to which he had added a splendid\r\nmadrepore vase, in the boat, and as soon as the swimmers were dressed,\r\nwe pulled over to Palm-islet.  Here we arranged a tent in the same\r\nmanner as we had done on the memorable night when we first reached these\r\nshores.  Max then kindled a fire, and prepared to cook our supper.  The\r\nshell-fish were easily managed by placing them upon the embers, but the\r\ncrabs, which it was necessary to boil, and which were of the size of\r\nsmall lobsters, presented a more difficult case.  Max's culinary genius,\r\nhowever, stimulated by a keen appetite, eventually triumphed over every\r\nobstacle.  He procured a number of stones, which he heated in the fire;\r\nthen filling one of the deep and rounded chama shells with water, he\r\nproceeded to drop the heated stones into it, using a couple of sticks as\r\na pair of tongs.  This process he continued until the water boiled, when\r\nhe remorselessly plunged the unhappy crabs therein, and from time to\r\ntime dropped in more of the heated stones, until the cookery was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nARTHUR'S STORY.\r\n\r\nBROWNE ON \"THE KNIGHTLY CHARACTER\"--ROKOA--THE CANNIBAL ISLAND OF\r\nANGATAN.\r\n\r\n  \"This is no Grecian fable of fountains running wine,\r\n  Of hags with snaky tresses, and sailors turned to swine:\r\n  On yonder teeming island, under the noon day sun,\r\n  In sight of many people, these strange, dark deeds were done.\"\r\n\r\nHaving made a hearty and satisfactory supper, and concluded the meal\r\nwith a draught of cocoa-nut milk, we sat down, like the patriarchs of\r\nold, \"in the door of our tent\" facing the sea, to enjoy the freshness of\r\nthe evening breeze.\r\n\r\nJohnny, after having settled it to his own entire satisfaction, that the\r\nshell in which his pearls had been found, was properly a mussel, and not\r\nan oyster; and having also, by Arthur's help, resolved his doubts and\r\ndifficulties, touching divers other knotty points in conchology;\r\nsuccessively raised and canvassed the grave and edifying questions--\r\nwhether there actually were such creatures as mermaids?--whether\r\nsea-serpents were indigenous to the neighbourhood of Cape Cod and\r\nMassachusetts Bay?--whether the narratives of ancient and modern\r\nvoyagers, in regard to Krakens, and gigantic Polypes, with feelers or\r\narms as long as a ship's main-mast, had any foundation in fact or were\r\nto be looked upon as sheer fabrications?--and, finally, whether the\r\nhideous and revolting practice of cannibalism, really prevailed among\r\nthe inhabitants of certain groups of islands in the Pacific?\r\n\r\n\"This puts me in mind, Arthur,\" said Johnny, suddenly, while the\r\nlast-mentioned subject was under discussion, \"of a promise you made\r\nduring the voyage, to tell me a story about a cannibal island upon which\r\nyou were once cast, and the adventures you met with there.  This is a\r\ngood time to tell it: it is quite early, and the night so beautiful,\r\nthat it would be a shame to think of going to bed for two or three hours\r\nyet; for my part, I feel as though I could sit here all night without\r\ngetting sleepy.\"\r\n\r\n\"A happy thought, Johnny,\" said Browne, \"it will be the pleasantest\r\npossible way of passing the evening; therefore, Arthur, let us have the\r\nstory.\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes, the story! let us have the cannibal story by all means!\" cried\r\nMax, \"this is just the hour, and the place, to tell it with effect.  The\r\ndash of the surf upon the reef; the whispering of the night wind in the\r\ntree-tops; the tall black groves on the shore yonder, and the water\r\nlying blacker still in their shadow, will all harmonise admirably with\r\nthe subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe I did promise Johnny an account of an unintentional visit I\r\nonce made to a place known as `the Cannibal Island of Angatan,' and I\r\nhave no objection to redeem my pledge now, if desired.  I wish you to\r\ntake notice, however, at the outset, in order to avoid raising false\r\nexpectations, that I do not promise you a `Cannibal Story'--how much my\r\nnarrative deserves such a title, will appear when you have heard it.\"\r\n\r\nThe call for the story being quite eager and unanimous, Arthur settled\r\nhimself into a comfortable position, and after giving one or two of\r\nthose preliminary ahems, common to the whole fraternity of story-tellers\r\nfrom time immemorial, he proceeded as follows:--\r\n\r\nARTHUR'S STORY OF THE CANNIBAL ISLAND OF ANGATAN.\r\n\r\n\"About a year and a half ago, and just before the time when I was to\r\nsail for the United States to complete my preparation for the seminary,\r\nI was induced to embark upon a voyage to the Palliser Islands, planned\r\nby a young chief of Eimeo, named Rokoa, and a Mr Barton, an American\r\ntrader residing at the island.  The object of the young chief in this\r\nexpedition, was to ascertain the fate of an elder brother, who had\r\nsailed for Anaa, or Chain island, several months before, with the\r\nintention of returning immediately, but who had never since been heard\r\nfrom: that of Mr Barton, was to engage a number of Hao-divers, for a\r\npearl-fishing voyage, contemplated by him in connection with another\r\nforeign trader.  He did not himself embark with us; but his son, a young\r\nman, two or three years my senior, accompanied us instead, to make the\r\nnecessary arrangements for engaging the divers, and also to purchase any\r\nmother-of-pearl, pearls, and tortoise-shell, which the natives might\r\nhave to dispose of, at such places as we should visit.  With a view to\r\nthe latter purpose, he was provided with a supply of trinkets and cheap\r\ngoods of various kinds, such as are used in this species of traffic.  At\r\nthe Society Islands, the natives had learned the fair value of their\r\ncommodities, and would no longer exchange even their yams, bread-fruit,\r\nand cocoa-nuts, for beads, spangles, and fragments of looking-glasses;\r\nbut among the smaller groups, lying farther to the eastward, where the\r\nintercourse with Europeans was comparatively infrequent, these, and\r\nsimilar articles, were still in great demand, the simple islanders\r\nreadily giving rich shells, and valuable pearls, in barter for them.  I\r\naccompanied the expedition, at the request of Rokoa, and with scarcely\r\nany other object than to gratify him; though I was made the bearer of\r\nletters, and some trifling presents to a Tahitian native missionary, who\r\nhad recently gone to Hao, to labour there.  I had long known both Rokoa\r\nand his brother, now supposed to be lost.  The former was a remarkable\r\nand interesting character.  He had accompanied my uncle and myself on a\r\nvoyage to Hawaii, and visited with us the great volcano of Kilauea, on\r\nthat island, said to be by far the grandest and most wonderful in the\r\nworld, not excepting Vesuvius itself.  In making the descent into the\r\ncrater, and while endeavouring to reach what is called the Black Ledge,\r\nhe saved my life at the imminent hazard of his own.  It was upon that\r\nvoyage, that I first became acquainted with him.  We afterwards\r\ntravelled together, through the most wild and inaccessible parts of the\r\ninterior of Tahiti and Eimeo; and in the course of this intimacy, I\r\ndiscovered much in him to esteem and admire.  There was in his\r\ncharacter, such a union of gentleness and courage, such childlike\r\nopenness of disposition, and such romantic fidelity to what he\r\nconsidered the obligations of friendship, as reminds me of young Edmund,\r\nin Johnny's favourite story of Asiauga's Knight.  With a chivalrous\r\ndaring, that could face the most appalling danger without a tremor, was\r\nunited an almost feminine delicacy of character, truly remarkable in a\r\nsavage.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Browne, \"is the true ideal of the knightly character--\r\ncourage, which nothing can daunt, but without roughness or ferocity even\r\nin the hour of mortal combat.  The valour of the knight is a high\r\nsentiment of honour, devotion, loyalty; it is calm, gentle, beautiful,\r\nand is thus distinguished from the mere animal courage of the ruffian,\r\nwhich is brutal, fierce, and cruel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I shall like Rokoa,\" said Johnny, rubbing his hands together in\r\ntoken of satisfaction, \"and I guess this is going to be an interesting\r\nstory; there will be some fighting in it, I expect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, there will be plenty of fighting,\" said Max, \"or else what\r\nis the meaning of this preliminary flourish of trumpets, about Rokoa's\r\nchivalrous courage, and all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I once more give fair and timely notice, in order to prevent\r\ndisappointment, that I am merely relating a sober narrative of facts,\r\nand not improvising one of Max's florid romances about Sooloo pirates,\r\nSpanish bandits, Italian bravos, or the robbers of the Hartz mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or enchanted castles, captive princesses, valiant knights,\r\nfire-breathing dragons, and diabolical old magicians,\" added Browne,\r\n\"which formed the staple of a highly edifying tale with which I\r\noverheard him entertaining Johnny the other afternoon at Castle-hill, as\r\nwe were taking our siesta in the shade.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a capital story it was, too,\" said Johnny, \"but go on, Arthur,\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, every thing being arranged for our voyage, we set sail in a large\r\n`Vaa Motu,' or single canoe, furnished with a great outrigger, and\r\nmanned by a crew of nine natives.  Our cargo consisted of Barton's stock\r\nof goods for trading with the islanders, and a quantity of stained\r\ntappa, fine mats, shark's teeth, etcetera, which Rokoa had laid in for\r\npurposes of his own.\r\n\r\n\"The commencement of the voyage was pleasant and auspicious.  We set out\r\nin the morning, with a fine westerly breeze, which is of rare occurrence\r\nin that latitude, and early in the afternoon we passed the high island\r\nof Meetia, just in sight to the southward, showing that we had made at\r\nleast seventy miles, in about nine hours.  The wind continued steady and\r\nfair, and the next day at sunset, we reached Anaa.  Here we remained\r\nonly long enough to enable Rokoa to obtain all the information to be\r\nhad, that promised to throw any light upon the fate of his brother.  All\r\nthat could be learned was, that a canoe from Tahiti had touched here\r\nseveral months since, and after obtaining a supply of water, had\r\nimmediately sailed for Motutunga, or Adventure Island, but from the\r\ndescription given us of the canoe, and of the number and appearance of\r\nher company, there was little reason to believe that this was the party\r\nwith which Rokoa's brother had embarked.  Barton being anxious to\r\nimprove the favourable breeze, which still continued to blow with\r\nunwonted steadiness from such a quarter, we resumed our voyage, and\r\nsteered eastward for Hao, on the day after our arrival at Anaa.\r\n\r\n\"That night the weather suddenly changed, and a storm arose, the wind\r\nblowing strongly from the south-west.  Our crew became alarmed, and a\r\npart of them began to clamour to return to Anaa, which we might have\r\ndone, by three or four hours' incessant paddling, in the teeth of the\r\ngale.  Rokoa, however, believed that the weather would change again in\r\nthe morning, and determined to continue on our course; we accordingly\r\nran before the wind, with barely sufficient sail to keep the canoe\r\nsteady, and enable us to steer her.  The storm continued without\r\nintermission or abatement for the next twenty-four hours, contrary to\r\nRokoa's prediction; and to avoid the danger of being swamped, we were\r\nobliged still to keep running before it.  The second night, at sunset,\r\nthe wind fell, and in the morning, the sea had become tolerably smooth,\r\nwith only a moderate breeze blowing.  But though the gale had ceased,\r\nthe weather was still thick, and the sky so obscured by clouds that we\r\ncould not see the sun, or even fix upon the quarter of the heavens in\r\nwhich he stood.  Thus, those means upon which the natives are wont to\r\nrely for directing their course upon their long voyages, wholly failed\r\nus.  The canoe was furnished with a small ship's compass, a present to\r\nRokoa from the missionaries, but this had been broken, by one of our\r\ncrew being thrown violently upon it during the storm, while Barton was\r\nconsulting it.  We did not get even a glimpse of the sun all that day;\r\nnor the next, until late in the afternoon, when it cleared beautifully,\r\nand for the first time since the loss of the compass, we were able to\r\ndistinguish north from south, and east from west.  We found that we had\r\ngot completely `turned round,' as the phrase is, and were heading due\r\nnorth; and we now put about, and steered in what we supposed to be the\r\nright direction.  At dawn the next day, we were surprised to find\r\nourselves in sight of a strange island, which none of us remembered\r\nhaving seen before.  A remarkable looking black rock, resembling the\r\nhull of a large man-of-war, rose abruptly from the water about half a\r\nmile from the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Rokoa, who had sailed a great deal among the islands east of Tahiti,\r\nand had visited most of them, could form no conjecture in regard to the\r\none now in sight.  Presently some of our crew began to whisper\r\nmysteriously together, and the word was passed from one to another, that\r\nthis was no other than the ill-famed island of Angatan.  I knew that an\r\nisland of that name, the subject of a thousand bug-bear stories, to\r\nwhich I had often incredulously listened, was said to lie somewhere to\r\nthe north of Hao; but I had never met with any one who could give me any\r\ndefinite and satisfactory information respecting it.\r\n\r\n\"According to general report, its inhabitants were cannibals, and were\r\nin the habit of murdering and devouring all who were so unfortunate as\r\nto be cast upon their shores, or who had the hardihood or temerity\r\nvoluntarily to land upon them.  It was also said, that the island had\r\nnever been visited by white men; and, owing to the popular belief in\r\nregard to the ferocious and warlike character of its people, it is\r\ncertain that the natives of the neighbouring groups could not, as a\r\ngeneral thing, be induced by any consideration to engage in a voyage\r\nhaving this reputed cannibal island for its destination; voyages of this\r\nkind having been sometimes contemplated, but never to my knowledge\r\nactually undertaken.\r\n\r\n\"Among the other marvellous reports concerning Angatan, was one, to the\r\neffect that its inhabitants were possessed of immense hoards of pearls\r\nand shell, of the value of which they were utterly ignorant.\r\n\r\n\"One of our crew, a garrulous Hao-man, and an inveterate boaster,\r\ndeclared that, about a year since, he had embarked for Angatan with a\r\nparty of Chain Islanders, in a large double canoe, being tempted to\r\nincur the perils of the enterprise, by the prospect of the enormous\r\ngains that might be realised in trading with the natives, if a friendly\r\nintercourse could once be opened with them.  They had succeeded in\r\nreaching the island; but scarcely had they set foot upon the shore, when\r\nthey were attacked by a party of the inhabitants, who issued suddenly\r\nfrom the forest, and, disregarding all their friendly signs and\r\ngestures, fell upon them, and killed the greater part of their number,\r\nthe rest making their escape with difficulty, and solely through the\r\ncourage, presence of mind, and extraordinary exertions of the narrator,\r\nwithout which they must all infallibly have perished.  He described the\r\nislanders as fierce, wild-looking men, of gigantic stature, armed with\r\nlong spears, and heavy clubs set with sharks' teeth, and wearing little\r\nor no clothing; yet, strange to tell, around the necks of these almost\r\nnaked savages were strings of the richest pearls, instead of the common\r\nornaments of ovula-shells.\r\n\r\n\"Our veracious Hao-man, most solemnly asseverated the entire and literal\r\ntruth of all these particulars, and declared that the island before us\r\nwas the veritable cannibal Angatan, the singular black rock enabling\r\nhim, as he said, to identify it beyond all doubt.  To this story I was\r\nmyself disposed to accord about the same degree of credit as to the\r\nadventures of Sinbad the Sailor; but it was easy to perceive that our\r\ncrew, far from being so sceptical, were firm and unhesitating believers\r\nin Angatan, its man-eating giants, its treasures of pearl, and the whole\r\ncatalogue of marvels current respecting it.\r\n\r\n\"I was the less inclined to repose any confidence in the man's\r\ndeclarations, because all the best accounts located Angatan far to the\r\nnorth of Hao and Amanu, while we had reason to believe that we were now\r\nto the south-west of them.\r\n\r\n\"Barton's curiosity and love of adventure, were stimulated by what he\r\nhad heard; perhaps, also, the hints which had been dropped respecting\r\nrich shell and costly pearls, were not without their due share of\r\ninfluence, and he declared himself desirous of taking a closer look at\r\nthis `terra incognita,' respecting which such marvellous tales were\r\ncurrent.  Rokoa, too, no sooner heard the first whispered conjecture of\r\nthe identity of the place before us with Angatan, than he resolved to\r\nland, notwithstanding the evident reluctance of the crew, and the open\r\nremonstrances and warnings of Sinbad.  I suspected, I scarcely know why,\r\nthat he cherished a vague hope of being able to gain here some clue to\r\nthe fate of his missing brother.  On approaching the shore, we found\r\nthat a heavy surf broke upon it, but there was a good beach, and a\r\nlanding could be effected without much difficulty.  We accordingly took\r\nin our sail, and resorting to the paddles, made for what seemed to be a\r\nfavourable spot.  Soon after passing the black rock before alluded to, I\r\nobserved several figures stealing along the shore, in the covert of a\r\nrow of mangrove bushes, and apparently watching our movements.  When we\r\nhad reached the edge of the surf, and were preparing to dash through it,\r\nthey came out of the thicket, and with threatening gestures warned us\r\naway.  This created such a panic among our crew, that they could not be\r\nprevailed upon to paddle nearer.  Rokoa stood up in the bow, and made\r\nsuch signs and gestures as are used to indicate peaceful and friendly\r\nintentions, while Barton displayed some of his most attractive-looking\r\ntrinkets.  The people on shore now seemed to confer together, and in a\r\nfew moments, one of their number, who, from his stained tiputa of yellow\r\nand crimson, appeared to be a chief or person of consequence, came down\r\nto the water's edge, waving a green bough, and beckoning us to land.\r\nOur Sinbad pronounced this sudden apparent change in their disposition\r\ntowards us, to be a treacherous pretence, designed to lure us ashore, in\r\norder that they might plunder, kill, and devour us; but, as he did not\r\nexplain why, if such was their object, they should in the first place\r\nhave menaced us as they had done, we gave little heed to his warnings.\r\nThe party of natives did not seem greatly to outnumber us, and were not\r\nparticularly formidable in their appearance.  They were, as well as we\r\ncould judge at such a distance, of no more than the ordinary stature.\r\nWith the exception of the individual already referred to, in the gay\r\ntiputa, they wore nothing but the maro, and were armed with long spears.\r\nNevertheless, our crew still refused to make any nearer approach,\r\nsuspecting that more of the natives were lurking among the mangrove;\r\nready to sally out upon us at the proper moment if we should venture to\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\"Rokoa, finding all attempts to overcome the cowardice of our men\r\nunavailing, took a few trinkets in his hand, and springing overboard,\r\nswam through the surf to the shore.  The personage in the tiputa waited\r\nto receive him, continuing to wave the green branch, and to make\r\namicable signs.  Rokoa advanced, and greeted him in the Tahitian\r\nfashion, by rubbing faces.  The two then walked together to the skirts\r\nof the wood, where the others still kept themselves, and Rokoa after\r\ndistributing his trinkets, came down to the beach again, and beckoned us\r\nto come ashore, supposing that our crew might by this time be so far\r\nreassured as to venture it.  Sinbad was about to remonstrate again, when\r\nBarton drew a pocket-pistol, with a pair of which he was provided, and\r\nthreatened to shoot him, unless he kept quiet.  This effectually\r\nsilenced the croakings of the Hao-man, for the time at least and we\r\nfinally induced some of the others to take to the paddles, and push\r\nthrough the surf to the spot where Rokoa awaited us.  As soon as the\r\ncanoe was beached, and we were all fairly ashore, the natives came\r\nforward, somewhat hastily, from the skirt of the wood, probably in the\r\nexpectation of receiving further presents; but our men, mistaking this\r\nsudden advance for a hostile movement, laid hold of the canoe, and would\r\nhave put her into the water again, had not Rokoa, armed with a heavy\r\npaddle, and backed by Barton with his pistols, interfered with so much\r\ndecision and vigour, that their fears began to take a new direction and\r\nthey came to the sensible conclusion, that they had better run the risk\r\nof being roasted and eaten by the cannibals, than encounter the far more\r\nimmediate danger of having their heads broken by the club of their\r\nchief, or their bodies bored through by the pistol-balls of the young\r\nPapalangi.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, the leader of the party of natives spoke to them,\r\nand restrained their impatience; then, advancing before the rest, he\r\nwaved his hand, and throwing himself into an oratorical attitude, made a\r\nlittle speech, thanking Rokoa for his gifts, and welcoming us to the\r\nisland.  The language which he spoke was a dialect of the Tahitian,\r\ndiffering from it so slightly that I had no difficulty in understanding\r\nwhat he said.\r\n\r\n\"When he had finished, Rokoa made an appropriate reply, according to the\r\nrules of Polynesian etiquette.  He commenced by paying our\r\ngaudily-attired friend some florid compliments.  He then gave a graphic\r\naccount of our voyage, describing the storm which we had encountered in\r\nsuch terms, that our escape must have seemed little short of a miracle;\r\nand concluded by stating the manner in which we had been driven from our\r\ncourse, and finally reached the island.  The natives listened\r\nattentively, and signified their sense of Rokoa's eloquence by frequent\r\nexclamations of `Maitai!  Maitai!'  (good! good!) and by nodding their\r\nheads emphatically at the end of every sentence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE CANNIBAL VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nTHE MARAE AND THE PRIEST--MOWNO AT HOME--CANNIBAL YOUNG LADIES--OLLA AND\r\nHER FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n  \"And there, with awful rites, the hoary priest,\r\n  Beside that moss-grown heathen altar stood,\r\n  His dusky form in magic cincture dressed,\r\n  And made the offering to his hideous god.\"\r\n\r\n\"So then,\" said Browne, interrupting Arthur's narrative, \"these two\r\nparties of savages, instead of going to work, knocking each others'\r\nbrains out, as one might naturally have expected, actually commenced\r\nentertaining one another with set speeches, very much like the mayor and\r\naldermen of a city corporation receiving a deputation of visitors!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is,\" replied Arthur, \"an almost childish fondness of form and\r\nceremony among all the Polynesian tribes, as is seen at their high\r\nfeasts and festivals, their games, and religious rites.  The chiefs and\r\npriests are in the habit of making little orations upon a variety of\r\noccasions, when this is expected of them.  Formerly there existed in the\r\nSociety Islands, a class of persons called Rautis, or orators of battle,\r\nwhose exclusive business it was to exhort the people in time of war, and\r\non the eve of an engagement.  Even during the heat of conflict they\r\nmingled with the combatants, and strove to animate and inflame their\r\ncourage, by recounting the exploits of their ancestors, and urging every\r\nmotive calculated to excite desperate valour and contempt of death.\r\nSome very remarkable instances of the powerful effect produced by the\r\neloquence of these Rautis are recorded, showing that they constituted a\r\nby no means useless or ineffective part of a native army.  The islanders\r\nalmost universally have a taste for oratory, by which they are easily\r\naffected; and they hold those who excel in it in high estimation.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would appear then,\" said Browne, \"that they are not such utter\r\nheathens after all; I should never have given them credit for so much\r\ntaste and sensibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Browne,\" said Max, \"what advantages you will enjoy over the\r\nrest of us, when we get to Eiulo's island, as Johnny is confident we are\r\ndestined to do, one of these days.  You shall then astonish the simple\r\ninhabitants, with Pitt's reply to Walpole, or `Now is the winter of our\r\ndiscontent,' and gain advancement in the state, by your oratorical\r\ngifts.  Who knows but you may rise to be prime-minister, or chief Rauti,\r\nto his majesty the king!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, let Arthur proceed with his story,\" said Morton, laughing, \"I see\r\nthat Johnny is beginning to grow impatient: he probably thinks it high\r\ntime for the cannibals to be introduced, and the fighting to commence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" resumed Arthur, \"as soon as the speech-making was over, the\r\nnatives, who seemed thus far, quite friendly and inoffensive, came\r\nforward once more, and we all went through the ceremony of rubbing\r\nfaces, with a great show of cordiality, though it was easy to perceive\r\nthat our party were still under the influence of secret fears and\r\nmisgivings.\r\n\r\n\"Barton and I, received more than our due proportion of these\r\ncivilities, and from the wondering exclamations of our new acquaintances\r\nas they examined the articles which composed our dress, and their\r\nremarks to one another upon our complexion, I inferred that some of them\r\nat least, had never seen a white person before.  Barton, in particular,\r\nattracted a large share of their attention, owing probably to a\r\ncomplexion rather florid, and uncommonly fair, notwithstanding a two\r\nyears' residence within the tropics, which, together with his light hair\r\nand blue eyes, afforded a striking contrast to the tawny skins and long\r\nblack elf-locks of the natives.\r\n\r\n\"The chief of the party, who had acted as spokesman, was called Mowno.\r\nHe was a young man, with a handsome, boyish face, expressive of\r\ngood-nature and indolence.  Rokoa walked apart with him to make\r\ninquiries, as I had no doubt, connected with the subject of his\r\nbrother's fate.  Meanwhile Barton produced a piece of tortoise-shell,\r\nand some pearls, which he exhibited to the natives, asking whether they\r\nhad any articles of the kind; but after carelessly looking at them, they\r\nshook their heads, and inquired what such things were good for;\r\nwhereupon Barton, casting an annihilating glance at the disconcerted\r\nSinbad, significantly demanded of him what had become of those necklaces\r\nof pearls, worn by the natives of Angatan, and whether these simple,\r\ninoffensive people, were the gigantic cannibals, about whom he had\r\nmanufactured such enormous lies.\r\n\r\n\"After Mowno had concluded his conference with Rokoa, he led us to a\r\nlarge building near the beach, in a very ruinous and decayed state, and\r\ncompletely over-shadowed by aged tamanu-trees.  It seemed, from its size\r\nand peculiar structure, to be a deserted marae, or native temple.  He\r\nthen sent away two of his people, who soon returned with several\r\nclusters of cocoa-nuts, and some bananas, for our refreshment.  On\r\nlearning that the supply of water which we had taken in for our voyage,\r\nwas nearly exhausted, he informed us that there was no spring or stream,\r\nnearer than his village, which was some two miles inland, and promised\r\nto have a supply sent us during the day.  They had come down to the\r\nshore, as we now learned, for the purpose of cutting mangrove roots,\r\nfrom which they make large and powerful bows, and the whole party soon\r\nleft us at the marae, and proceeded to the beach; in about an hour we\r\nsaw them depart inland, carrying fagots of these roots, without taking\r\nany further notice of us.\r\n\r\n\"It had fallen calm soon after sunrise, so that we could not for the\r\npresent have resumed our voyage, had we been so inclined.\r\n\r\n\"About half an hour before noon, a number of the natives whom we had\r\nseen in the morning, again made their appearance, with several large\r\ncalabashes of water, and a quantity of taro and bread-fruit for our use.\r\nRokoa distributed among them some trifling presents, which they hastily\r\nconcealed among the folds of their maros.  A few moments afterwards\r\nMowno himself emerged from the grove, attended by the remainder of the\r\nparty we had seen in the morning.  There was now a further distribution\r\nof presents, when I perceived the reason why the first comers had so\r\nhastily concealed the trifles which had been given them.  All presents,\r\nno matter on whom bestowed, seemed to be regarded as the especial\r\nperquisites of the chief, and a youth, who acted as Mowno's personal\r\nattendant, presently went round among the others, collecting and taking\r\npossession of everything which he had seen them receive.  This was\r\nsubmitted to without remonstrance, and apparently as a matter of course,\r\nthough by no means cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after this somewhat autocratic proceeding, Mowno turned abruptly\r\nto Barton, and saying that he must now return to the village, invited\r\nhim to go with him to visit it.  Barton appearing to hesitate, the chief\r\npressed the matter so earnestly that his suspicions were aroused, and he\r\nperemptorily declined.  Mowno's angry looks evinced his displeasure, and\r\nafter walking about for a quarter of an hour in sullen silence, with\r\nvery much the demeanour of a spoiled child thwarted in his whim, he at\r\nlength made a similar request of me, letting drop at the same time, some\r\nexpression to the effect that one of us _must_ go with him.  Fortunately\r\nRokoa, whose high spirit would have taken instant offence at the least\r\nsemblance of a threat, did not hear this.  I saw plainly, that for some\r\nreason, the young chief had set his heart upon having either Barton or\r\nmyself visit his village, and I suspected this was, in fact, the sole\r\nobject of his return.  I observed, also, that his party was somewhat\r\nmore numerous, and much better armed than it had been in the morning,\r\nand I had no doubt that, rather than suffer himself to be baffled in his\r\npurpose, he would resort to force to accomplish it.\r\n\r\n\"After a moment's reflection, I was pretty well satisfied that I had\r\nnothing to fear from acceding to his request, believing, as I did, that\r\nI understood the motive of it.  I thought, too, that a refusal would in\r\nall probability lead to an instant hostile collision between the natives\r\nand ourselves, and I finally resolved to accept, or more accurately\r\nspeaking, to yield to, the invitation.  Having come to this conclusion,\r\nI told Mowno that I would go with him, upon the condition that I should\r\nreturn before night, to which he readily assented, showing extreme\r\nsatisfaction at having finally succeeded in his wishes.  I gave no\r\ncredit to the alleged cannibal propensities of the islanders, and was\r\ninclined from what I had already seen, to think much more favourably of\r\nthem than the event justified.  I supposed that the curiosity of the\r\npeople of the village had been excited by the reports of those who had\r\nseen us in the morning, respecting the pale-faced strangers, and that\r\nMowno's only object in insisting as he did, on having Barton or myself\r\ngo with him, was to gratify some aged chief who was too infirm to come\r\ndown to the shore to see us, or did not want to take the trouble of\r\ndoing so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, was you right in your conjecture?\" inquired Browne.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, partially at least; there was, I think, no unfriendly motive as\r\nfar as Mowno was concerned.  What designs others of the natives may have\r\nentertained I will not at present undertake to say.  But instead of some\r\nsuperannuated chief, it was the curiosity of Mowno's young wife that was\r\nto be gratified.  On hearing his account of the white strangers, she had\r\ndespatched him forthwith back to the shore, to bring them to the\r\nvillage; which commission, it seemed, he was resolved faithfully to\r\nexecute, at every hazard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Browne, \"civilisation must have made some considerable\r\nprogress in Angatan, if the savages there make such docile and\r\ncomplaisant husbands.\"\r\n\r\n\"This was not an ordinary case,\" replied Arthur; \"in the first place,\r\nMowno was an uncommonly good-natured sort of a savage; then he had a\r\nvery pretty, persuasive little wife, and he had not yet been long enough\r\nmarried, to have entirely merged the zeal and devotion of the lover, in\r\nthe easy indifference, and staid authority of the husband; but this is\r\nanticipating.\r\n\r\n\"When I informed Rokoa of the young chief's invitation, and my\r\nacceptance of it, he refused to consent to my going, except upon the\r\ncondition that he should accompany me, and share whatever danger might\r\nattend the step.  Mowno acquiesced in this arrangement, though I thought\r\nhe didn't seem to be altogether pleased with it.  Barton, also, on\r\nlearning that Rokoa and myself had concluded to go to the village,\r\nresolved to accompany us.  Mowno was impatient to have us set out at\r\nonce, and Rokoa having given some directions to the crew, as to their\r\nconduct during our absence, we hastily made our preparations, and in a\r\nfew moments after the matter had been decided upon, the whole party left\r\nthe shore and entered the forest.  A quarter of an hour's walk brought\r\nus to a flourishing bread-fruit plantation, which we passed through\r\nwithout seeing a single dwelling, or any indications of inhabitants.\r\nThis was bounded by a wild ravine, crossing which, we entered a dense\r\nand gloomy grove, composed almost entirely of the sacred miro, and one\r\nother kind of tree, the branches of which sprang horizontally from the\r\ntrunk, in a series of whorls, one above another, twisting round from\r\nleft to right, and clothed with broad leaves of so dark a green as to\r\nseem almost black.  Near the centre of this grove, we came suddenly upon\r\na large marae, built principally of loose stones, overgrown with moss\r\nand lichens.  It was a spacious, uncovered inclosure, the front of which\r\nconsisted of a strong bamboo fence, while the three remaining sides were\r\nof stone.  Within the inclosure, at one side, was a small building,\r\nprobably the priest's dwelling, and in the centre arose a solid\r\npyramidal structure, on the terraced sides of which were ranged the\r\nmisshapen figures of several gigantic idols.  In front of this, and\r\nbetween four rude tumuli of broken coral, was a low platform, supported\r\nby stakes, and resembling the altars used for human sacrifices, during\r\nthe ancient reign of heathenism in Tahiti.  Beneath this platform, or\r\naltar, was a pile of human skulls; and suspended from the trees, were\r\nthe shells of enormous turtles, and the skeletons of fishes.  A\r\nhideous-looking old man, whom I supposed to be the priest, sat in the\r\ndoor of the small building, within the inclosure, and looking intently\r\nat me, made strange faces as we passed by.  His skin was sallow, and\r\nsingularly speckled, probably from some cutaneous disease; he had no\r\neyebrows, and his eyes were small and glittering like those of a snake;\r\nin his countenance there was a mingled expression of cunning and cruelty\r\nthat made me shudder.  When we were nearest to him in passing, he struck\r\nhimself violently on the breast, and cried out in a strong but dissonant\r\nvoice, pointing with his long, skeleton fingers, towards the young\r\nchief:--`Mowno, son of Maloa, rob not the servant of Oro of a priest's\r\nshare!' so at least, I understood the words which he uttered; but the\r\nnatives hurried on, without seeming to pay any attention to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would have frightened me mortally,\" interrupted Johnny.  \"I should\r\nhave thought that they were going to make a cannibal feast of me, and\r\nthat the wicked old priest was speaking for his share.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I confess that some notion of the sort flashed across my mind for\r\na moment.  The dark grove, the great idolatrous looking marae, with its\r\nheathen altar, and monstrous images; the pile of skulls; the hideous old\r\nman and his strange words; all tended to suggest vague but startling\r\nsuspicions.  But another glance at the open and friendly countenances of\r\nour guides reassured me.  In answer to a question in regard to the\r\nbuilding which we had just passed, Mowno said, with a natural and\r\nindifferent air, that it was the house of Oro, where a great solemnity\r\nwas soon to be celebrated; and although I did not allude to the skulls,\r\nhe added that they were a part of the remains of the priests, who had\r\nbeen buried within the inclosure, and which were now, in accordance with\r\nan established custom, placed beneath the altar.  The dark wood was\r\nbounded by a charming valley, with a brook running through it, and I was\r\nglad to escape from its gloomy shade, into the cheerful light.  We\r\nforded the shallow stream, which was so clear that every pebble in its\r\ngravelly bed was visible, and found ourselves at the foot of a long,\r\ngreen slope.  Before us, lying partly in the valley, and straggling\r\nhalf-way up the ascent, was a pretty village.  The neat and light-built\r\nnative dwellings dotted the side of the slope, or peeped out from among\r\nembowering trees along the banks of the brook, in the most picturesque\r\nmanner.  The thatching of the cottages, bleached to an almost\r\nsnowy-whiteness, offered a pleasing contrast to the surrounding verdure.\r\nTroops of children were pursuing their sports in every direction.  Some\r\nwere wading in the stream, sailing tiny boats, or actively spattering\r\none another with water, a recreation which they could enjoy without any\r\nfear of that damage to clothing, which would have rendered it\r\nobjectionable in more highly civilised communities.  Others again, (many\r\nof them scarcely old enough to walk, as one would suppose), were\r\nswimming about in the deeper places, like amphibious creatures.  Some\r\nwere swinging on ropes of sennit, suspended from the branches of the\r\ntrees, and a few were quietly sitting in the shade, making bouquets and\r\nwreaths of wild-flowers.  Among them all, there was not a single\r\ndeformed or sickly-looking child.  I did not observe any grown persons,\r\nmost of them probably being at that hour asleep in their houses.  In\r\npassing through the village, our escort closed around us in such a\r\nmanner as to screen us from observation, and we reached the top of the\r\nslope without seeming to have attracted notice.  Here Mowno dismissed\r\nall his attendants except two, and we then struck into a fine avenue of\r\nwell-grown trees, running along the crest of the hill, and leading to a\r\nlarge native house, of oval form, prettily situated upon a green knoll,\r\nand over-shadowed by wide-branching bread-fruit trees.  This, Mowno\r\ninformed us, was his dwelling.  At a short distance from the house,\r\nbeneath a fan-palm, was a group of young girls, so entirely absorbed in\r\nthe congenial task of arranging one another's abundant tresses, and\r\nadorning themselves with flowers, that they did not observe our\r\napproach.  Mowno seemed intent upon some playful surprise, and laughing\r\nsoftly to himself like a pleased child, he motioned us to hide ourselves\r\nin a thicket of young casuarinas.  From our ambush he pointed out to us\r\none of the group beneath the palm, having several white buds of the\r\nfragrant gardenia in her hair, and a garland of the rosa cinensis about\r\nher neck; when satisfied that he had drawn our attention to the right\r\nperson, he gave us to understand, with an air of great complacency, that\r\nshe was `Olla,' his wife.  While thus engaged, we were suddenly\r\ndiscovered, being betrayed by Mowno's gaudy tiputa, seen through the\r\nfoliage by the quick eye of his better half, who immediately sprang up\r\nwith a clear, ringing laugh, scattering a lapful of flowers upon the\r\nground, and came running like a fawn towards him; the rest of us still\r\nkeeping concealed.  She was very pretty, graceful as a bird in every\r\nmovement, and had a singularly pleasing expression of countenance.\r\n\r\n\"On witnessing the greeting which she bestowed upon Mowno, Barton\r\nwhispered me that he ought to consider himself a happy savage, and to do\r\nhim justice, he seemed to be of the same opinion himself.  She commenced\r\ntalking at once, with wonderful vivacity, pouring forth a continuous\r\ntorrent of words, with little gushes of laughter interspersed here and\r\nthere by way of punctuation, and making no longer or more frequent\r\npauses than were absolutely necessary for the purpose of taking breath.\r\nNotwithstanding her amazing volubility, I could understand enough of\r\nwhat she said, to perceive that she was inquiring after `the pale-faced\r\nyouths,' and presently she appeared to be scolding her husband in a\r\npretty lively strain, for having failed to bring them with him according\r\nto his promise.  It was amusing to witness Mowno's ludicrous struggles\r\nto look grave, while he made feigned excuses, and explanations of our\r\nabsence.  His demeanour resembled more that of a boy, whose head has\r\nbeen turned by becoming, for the first time, the actual and uncontrolled\r\nowner of a watch, or a fowling-piece, than of a stern warrior, or savage\r\nchief.  He could not, with all his efforts, maintain sufficient gravity\r\nand self-possession, to carry out the jest, poor as it was, which he had\r\nundertaken; but kept glancing towards our hiding-place, and finally,\r\nburst into a boisterous explosion of laughter; when Olla, peeping into\r\nthe thicket, caught sight of us, and instantly darted away with a pretty\r\nhalf-scream, and rejoined her companions.  Mowno now beckoned us forth,\r\nand we approached the group, whereupon they made a show of scampering\r\noff into the grove, but apparently thought better of it, and concluded\r\nto stand their ground.  At first, they seemed actually afraid of Barton\r\nand myself, peeping cautiously at us over one another's shoulders from a\r\nsafe distance.  Presently, one, more enterprising than the rest,\r\nventured so far as to reach out her hand, and touch Barton on the cheek,\r\nwhen, finding that no disastrous consequences immediately followed this\r\nact of temerity, they gradually laid aside their apprehensions, and\r\npressing around us, soon became sufficiently familiar to try a variety\r\nof highly original and interesting experiments upon our complexion and\r\nclothing.  These, though somewhat annoying, were accompanied by\r\nquestions and observations so irresistibly ludicrous, that we soon found\r\nit entirely out of the question to preserve any sort of gravity, and as\r\nthe whole troop always joined in our laughter without stopping to\r\nunderstand its cause, or instantly led off of themselves, upon the\r\nslightest provocation, the woods resounded with peals of merriment.\r\n\r\n\"One of these damsels, after examining Barton's fair skin, and flowing\r\nyellow locks, gravely communicated to a companion, her conviction that\r\nwe had come from the moon.  A second stoutly maintained our earthly\r\norigin, and attributed our paleness to the influence of some strange\r\nsickness; while a third, being of a sceptical and suspicious turn of\r\nmind, suddenly seized Barton by the wrist and spitting upon the skirt of\r\nher pareu, commenced scrubbing his hand with great vigour, to see\r\nwhether the colours were fast.  Our tight-fitting garments; too, seemed\r\nto puzzle them exceedingly, and we were listeners to an animated debate,\r\nupon the question whether they were a natural or an artificial covering;\r\nthe young lady who upheld the theory of our lunar origin, inclining\r\nstrongly to the opinion, that like the feathery coat of birds, our\r\nclothing was a part of ourselves.  But the sagacity and penetration of\r\nthe one who had endeavoured to wash the paint from Barton's hand, soon\r\nenabled her to discover the unsoundness of this doctrine, and, in order\r\nthe more triumphantly to refute it, she insisted upon pulling off my\r\njacket, and trying it on herself.  Finding that nothing less would\r\nsatisfy her, I resigned the garment, when having succeeded, with some\r\nassistance, in getting into it, and buttoning it up as far as was\r\npracticable, she snatched Barton's cap to complete her costume, and\r\ncommenced parading up and down the avenue, the admiration and envy of\r\nher companions.  I fully expected that Barton's coat would next be put\r\nin requisition, and he whispered me that he stood in momentary dread,\r\nlest the now awakened spirit of investigation and experiment, should\r\nprompt our new friends to still more embarrassing extremes.\r\n\r\n\"This, however, proved to be a groundless apprehension, for their\r\ncuriosity was presently diverted into a new channel by Olla, who\r\nsuddenly demanded to know my name.  I accordingly repeated it, and she\r\nendeavoured several times to pronounce it after me, but without success.\r\nThe `th' seemed to constitute an insuperable difficulty, which,\r\nhowever, she finally evaded, by softening `Arthur' into `Artua,' and\r\nthis, singularly enough, was what Rokoa had always been in the habit of\r\ncalling me.  He and Barton were now called upon for their names, and in\r\nreturn, we were favoured with the liquid and vowelly appellatives, by\r\nwhich our ingenuous and communicative acquaintances were respectively\r\ndesignated.  Barton assumed the alias of Tom, which was straightway\r\nmetamorphosed into `Tomma.'\r\n\r\n\"While this exchange of names was going on, an old woman came from the\r\nhouse, and delivered some message to Olla, which from the repetition of\r\nthe words `poe, poe,' I conjectured to be a summons to dinner.  Mowno\r\nleading the way, we now proceeded towards the dwelling.  It was\r\nsurrounded by a strong, but neat hedge of the ti-plant some three and a\r\nhalf feet high, with an ingeniously contrived wicker gate opposite the\r\ndoor.  A path strewn with marine shells, and fragments of white coral,\r\nled from the gate to the door.  The space within the inclosure was\r\nchiefly devoted to the cultivation of yams and other vegetables, but\r\nOlla showed me a little plot of ground, near the house, which she said\r\nwas her own garden.  It was tastefully arranged, and carefully kept, and\r\na considerable variety of flowers, all of which she had herself\r\ntransplanted from the woods, were there in full bloom.  Most conspicuous\r\namong them was the native jasmine, and a species of wood-pink, both of\r\nwhich were fragrant.  The building itself was a model of a native\r\ndwelling, and since we are to-morrow to try our own skill in\r\nhouse-building, I will endeavour to describe it.  It was of an oval\r\nshape; the sides were inclosed with handsome mats, with spaces left for\r\nthe admission of light and air.  The roof was composed of a firm and\r\ndurable thatch of pandanus leaves, strung upon small reeds, laid closely\r\ntogether, and overlapping one another from the eaves to the ridge-pole.\r\n\r\n\"From the inside, the appearance was the neatest and prettiest\r\nimaginable, the whiteness of the straight and slender rafters of peeled\r\nhibiscus, contrasting well with the ceiling of shining brown leaves\r\nwhich they sustained.  The furniture of the house consisted of a number\r\nof large sleeping-mats, five or six carved wooden stools, and two narrow\r\ntables, or rather shelves, of wicker-work, fastened against the wall at\r\nopposite sides of the room.  Upon one of these were arranged a number of\r\ncalabashes, carved wooden dishes, cocoa-nut drinking-cups, and other\r\ndomestic utensils.  Upon the other was a native drum, several clubs and\r\nspears, a long vivo or native flute, and a hideous-looking wooden image\r\nwith four arms and a bunch of red feathers fastened to what was\r\ndoubtless meant for its head.  The rafters were ornamented with braided\r\nand coloured cords wound round them, the ends of which hung down several\r\nfeet, and sustained a number of weapons and various other articles\r\nsuspended by them.\r\n\r\n\"At the farther end of the room, a woman was pounding taro, or\r\nbread-fruit, in a wooden mortar; another, apparently very old and\r\ninfirm, was sitting upon a low stool near the wall, swaying her body\r\nslowly from side to side, and making a low, monotonous noise.  I\r\nobserved that Olla frequently looked towards the latter, with a mournful\r\nexpression of countenance.  When we first entered the house, she went\r\nand sat down by her side, and talked with her in a low tone, and when\r\nshe turned away, her eyes were full of tears.  The old woman did not\r\nevince any corresponding emotion, but muttered something feebly and\r\nindistinctly, as if replying to what Olla had said, of which I could\r\ndistinguish the words, `It is best, child; Malola is very old; she is\r\nsick and weak; she cannot work; it is time she should be buried out of\r\nthe way.'  I instantly suspected that this unhappy creature was to be\r\ndestroyed by her own friends, on account of her age and infirmities,\r\naccording to a most horrible and unnatural, but too prevalent custom.  I\r\nhad once been present at a scene of this kind, without the slightest\r\npossibility of successful interference, when a native woman had been\r\nstrangled; her own son, pulling at one end of the tappa which encircled\r\nhis mother's neck.  In that case, the victim, instead of submitting\r\nquietly and willingly to her fate, (as is most usual), suddenly lost her\r\ncourage at the moment of reaching the grave, beside which she was to be\r\nstrangled, and opposed a frantic and desperate resistance to her\r\nmurderers.  Her heart-rending cries; her fearful struggles; and, more\r\nthan all, the horrid indifference and cruelty of her executioners, have\r\nleft upon my mind an indelible impression.  I now resolved that if my\r\nsuspicions proved just, I would make an earnest effort to prevent the\r\nrepetition of so inhuman a deed, and from what I had already seen of the\r\nmild disposition of Mowno, I was inclined to believe that there was\r\ngreat hope of success in such an endeavour.\r\n\r\n\"Rokoa, on hearing the conversation above mentioned, had given me a\r\nsignificant glance, which sufficiently explained to me how he understood\r\nit.  A very few moments sufficed to confirm my worst suspicions: I\r\nlearned that the aged female who had spoken of herself as Malola, was\r\nMowno's aunt and that she was, with her own full consent and approval,\r\nto be destroyed in a few days.  From the manner in which Olla alluded to\r\nit, while I inferred that such acts were by no means uncommon among\r\nthese people, I at the same time clearly perceived, that custom and\r\neducation had not stifled or perverted in her gentle nature, at least,\r\nthe ordinary feelings and impulses of humanity, and that she anticipated\r\nthe deed with terror and loathing.  I determined to watch for an\r\nopportunity to converse with Mowno, and discover, if possible, whether\r\nthe cruel insensibility, implied in countenancing such a practice, could\r\nreally be concealed beneath so smooth and pleasant an aspect.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, the meal, to which we had been summoned, was spread under\r\nthe shade trees beside the house.  It consisted of baked fish, served up\r\nin banana leaves, roasted yams, poe-poe, a preparation of bread-fruit,\r\nand an excellent kind of pudding, made of cocoa-nut-pulp and taro.  It\r\nwas easy to perceive that Olla, with all her playfulness and girlish\r\nvivacity, was a notable housekeeper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me interrupt you a moment, to ask a single question,\" said Max.\r\n\"Did you get the recipe for making that pudding from Mrs Mowno?--if so,\r\nplease impart the same for the general good, and I will try my hand at\r\nit the first convenient opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heathen!\" exclaimed Browne, \"can you think of nothing but gormandising?\r\nPray, Arthur, proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And bring on those cannibals forthwith,\" added Morton, \"for unless you\r\ndo so, Johnny will despair entirely of any fighting, and go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nAN EXPLOSION.\r\n\r\nTHE CANNIBALS APPRECIATE MUSIC AND ELOQUENCE, BUT TAKE OFFENCE AT THE\r\nNEW THEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n  \"Then tumult rose, fierce rage, and wild affright.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon,\" resumed Arthur, \"we went with our host and hostess,\r\nand our companions at dinner, to a grove on the banks of the stream--a\r\nplace of general resort for the villagers during the latter part of\r\nevery fine day.  The younger people met there, to pursue a variety of\r\nsports and athletic exercises, and the older to gossip and look on.  We\r\nhad intended to return to the boat, as soon as the repast was over, and\r\nit would have been well had we done so.  But our new friends insisted so\r\nstrenuously upon our accompanying them to the grove, that we yielded at\r\nlast to their playful importunities, so far as to consent to make a\r\nbrief pause there on our way.  We had gone but a short distance from the\r\nhouse, when a bird of about the size of a robin, flew down from a tree\r\nbeneath which we were passing, and after circling several times around\r\nOlla's head, alighted on her finger, which she held out for it to perch\r\nupon.  It was a young wood-pigeon, which she had found in the grove,\r\nwhen a callow half-fledged thing, the old bird having been captured or\r\nkilled by some juvenile depredators.  Taking pity on its orphan state,\r\nOlla had adopted and made a pet of it: it was now perfectly tame, and\r\nwould come readily at her call of `Lai-evi', (little captive), the name\r\nshe had given it, attending her so closely as to be seldom during the\r\nday beyond the sound of her voice.\r\n\r\n\"On reaching the grove, we found quite a number of the natives, of all\r\nages and of both sexes assembled, and though they soon began to gather\r\nabout us with inquisitive looks, we were subjected to much less\r\nannoyance than might reasonably have been expected under the\r\ncircumstances.  We were neither crowded, nor jostled, nor even\r\noffensively stared at, the very children appearing to possess an innate\r\ndelicacy and sense of propriety, (though it may have been timidity),\r\nwhich made them try to gratify their curiosity covertly, seizing those\r\nopportunities to peep at us, when they thought they were themselves\r\nunobserved.\r\n\r\n\"Barton, who possessed an enviable faculty of adapting himself to all\r\nsorts of people and circumstances, was in a few moments as much at home\r\namong the villagers as if he had lived for years in their midst.  He\r\ngossiped with the old people, romped with the children, and chatted and\r\nfrolicked with the prettiest and most lively of the dusky maidens, to\r\nthe manifest disapprobation of several grim-looking young savages, who\r\nstalked about in sullen dignity watching these familiar proceedings of\r\nthe handsome stranger, with rising jealousy and indignation.\r\n\r\n\"At length a bevy of laughing girls, in punishment for some impertinence\r\nwith which they charged him, fell to pelting him with jasmine buds and\r\npandanus cones, the latter of which, in mischievous hands, are capable\r\nof becoming rather formidable missiles.  Foremost among the assailants\r\nwere our fair acquaintances of the morning, and even Olla, forgetting\r\nher matronly station and dignity, joined zealously in the flowery\r\nwarfare; which was maintained with such spirit, that Barton was at\r\nlength obliged to beg for quarter, promising at the same time to `make\r\nsome music' for them, as a condition of the suspension of hostilities.\r\nThis proposition, as soon as it was understood, seemed to afford the\r\nmost extravagant delight; the shower of missiles ceased at once, and\r\nBarton was immediately surrounded by as attentive and breathlessly\r\nexpectant an audience as artist could desire.  Taking his stand upon a\r\nmoss-covered fragment of rock, he drew an enormous Jew's-harp from his\r\npocket, and handed it to me, gravely requesting me to `accompany' him\r\nupon it, while he sang.  Then, after clearing his throat, with quite a\r\nprofessional air, he commenced `Hail Columbia,' and as he had a full,\r\nclear voice, and sang with great spirit, the performance was listened to\r\nwith every mark of enjoyment, and was succeeded by rapturous applause.\r\n\r\n\"He next gave a solo on the Jew's-harp to the air of `Yankee Doodle,'\r\nwith brilliant and original variations, which likewise met with a\r\nflattering reception.  But by far the greatest sensation was produced by\r\n`Auld Lang syne,' which we sang together as a grand finale.  The natives\r\nreally seemed to feel the sentiment of the music, although Barton turned\r\nit into a burlesque by such an exaggerated pathos of tone and\r\nexpression, and gesture, that I had much difficulty in getting through\r\nmy part of the performance without laughing; but my vexation at being\r\nsurprised into taking a part in such a piece of buffoonery, greatly\r\nhelped me in resisting my sense of the ludicrous.  At the end of every\r\nverse, Barton grasped my hand in the most demonstrative manner, and\r\ncommenced shaking it vigorously, looking me all the while solemnly in\r\nthe face, and shaking away through the entire chorus, thereby producing\r\na number of quavers, which, though not set down in the music, greatly\r\nadded to its pathetic character.  After the last chorus, he spread open\r\nhis arms, rushed forward, and gave me a stage embrace.  This\r\nperformance, including the pantomime, must have been of a very moving\r\ncharacter, for when we had finished, I actually saw tears in the eyes of\r\nseveral of our audience.  This evidence of the gentle and\r\nunsophisticated character of these simple people, affected me almost as\r\nmuch as our music had moved them, and I could not help thinking to how\r\nmuch better account such amiable impressibility was capable of being\r\nturned.\r\n\r\n\"Having thus performed his promise, Barton now insisted that we ought to\r\nbe entertained in our turn with some music, and after a little\r\npersuasion, three young girls sang, or rather chaunted, several\r\nplaintive, but somewhat monotonous airs.  Their voices, though neither\r\nstrong nor clear, were soft and melodious, like the cooing of their\r\nnative wood-pigeons.  In vain we asked for something livelier and more\r\nspirited.  Barton humming the tune of `Yankee Doodle,' to make them the\r\nbetter understand what we wanted.  All their melodies seemed to be of a\r\nslow and measured character, and those specimens which we heard,\r\nembraced a comparatively narrow range of notes.\r\n\r\n\"Just as the native girls finished singing, we were joined by a fresh\r\nparty of eight or ten men, who came across the brook, and mingled with\r\nthe others.  I heard Barton say to Rokoa, `There is the old priest\r\nagain,' but on looking around I could not see him.  The new-comers did\r\nnot appear to be in the same holiday humour as the throng around us;\r\nthey walked gravely about without joining in the general mirth and\r\ngaiety, and manifesting none of the curiosity in regard to ourselves,\r\nwhich the others had evinced.  I, however, thought nothing of this at\r\nthe time, supposing that they had been of the number of those whom we\r\nhad seen in the morning by the sea-shore, although I did not recognise\r\nany of them.\r\n\r\n\"Presently, Olla and her companions commenced begging us for more music.\r\nOne young lady in particular, (the same who had pronounced us to be\r\ninhabitants of the moon), pressed Barton with unceasing importunities,\r\nmingled with threats of a renewal of hostilities in case of\r\nnon-compliance.  Finding all attempts at excuse or evasion utterly\r\nunavailing, he suddenly snatched a wreath of yellow candle-nut-blossoms\r\nfrom the head of his tormentress, crowned himself therewith, and\r\nspringing upon the top of the rock, assumed an oratorical attitude, and\r\nwaved his hand, as if about to harangue the people.  Then, while I was\r\nwondering what was to come next, he fixed his eye sternly upon a\r\nsinister looking man of middle-age, with the head-dress of an inferior\r\nchief, who was standing directly in front of him, and began to declaim\r\nin Latin, with great vehemence--`Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina,\r\npatientia nostra,' etcetera, which the audience seemed at first, to\r\nconsider highly interesting and entertaining.  As he proceeded,\r\ndelivering the sounding sentences, `ore rotundo,' and emphasising each\r\nthundering polysyllable with a fierce gesture of his clenched fist, I\r\nobserved that the individual before mentioned, whom the orator seemed to\r\nhave chosen to represent Catiline, and who, without understanding Latin,\r\ncould very well perceive that there was something menacing and\r\nvituperative in the language addressed to him, began to look at first\r\npuzzled, and then incensed.  He stole two or three hurried and uncertain\r\nglances at those behind and immediately around him, as if to assure\r\nhimself whether this torrent of denunciation was not in fact directed\r\nagainst some other person; but when all doubt on this point seemed to\r\nhave been resolved by the unequivocal demonstrations of the orator, his\r\nrigid features assumed an expression of such anger and ferocity, that I\r\nbegan to fear some violent outbreak of passion, and made several\r\nattempts by signs and gestures, to indicate to Barton the danger of\r\npursuing so thoughtless and imprudent a pleasantry.  But he either did\r\nnot perceive my meaning, or else, felt rather flattered than alarmed, by\r\nthe effect which his elocution seemed to produce upon Catiline, for he\r\ncontinued to pour out upon him the torrent of his oratory for several\r\nminutes longer, and it was not until his memory began evidently to fail\r\nhim, that he concluded with a last emphatic invective accompanied by a\r\nsufficiently significant pantomime to convey some notion of its meaning,\r\nand bowing to his audience, leaped from the rostrum.\r\n\r\n\"This performance, seemed to afford even greater pleasure to the male\r\npart of the assembly, (with a few exceptions), than the previous musical\r\nentertainment had done, and they testified their approbation, by\r\nemphatic nods and shouts of applause.\r\n\r\n\"I now thought it time to terminate our visit, and return to the boat,\r\nand was about to speak to Rokoa on the subject, when Barton seized me by\r\nthe arm, and pushed me towards the platform of rock.\r\n\r\n\"`Now, Arthur, it is your turn,' said he, `you perceive what an effect\r\nmy eloquence has produced on old Catiline, there: give him a lecture\r\nupon the sinfulness of indulging the vindictive passions, and exhort him\r\nto repentance.'\r\n\r\n\"The younger people pressed about me, and instigated and aided by\r\nBarton, they fairly forced me upon the rocky platform.  Though by no\r\nmeans pleased at being obliged to take a part in a farce so little to my\r\ntaste, and for which I possessed none of Barton's talent, I saw plainly\r\nthat the shortest and least troublesome way, was to comply with their\r\nwishes, and I accordingly endeavoured to recall some fragment of prose\r\nor verse which might serve the present purpose.  Supposing that English\r\nwould be quite as intelligible and acceptable to them as Barton's Latin,\r\nI was just about to declaim those noble opening lines of Comus--\r\n\r\n  \"`Before the starry threshold of Jove's Court,' etcetera.\r\n\r\n\"Which used to be a favourite of mine at school, when suddenly another\r\nimpulse seized me.\r\n\r\n\"As I glanced around upon the circle of smiling, upturned countenances,\r\nI was struck by the docile and childlike expression of many of them.  I\r\nthought of the sad and benighted condition of this simple people,\r\nwithout the knowledge of God, or the hope of immortality, given up, as\r\nit seemed, a helpless prey to the darkest and most cruel superstitions.\r\nI thought of the moss-grown marae in the dark wood, with its hideous\r\nidols, its piles of human bones, and its hoary priest--fit minister of\r\nsuch a religion.  I remembered the aged woman at Mowno's house, and the\r\nfrightful doom in reserve for her.  I felt that perhaps to such\r\nimpressible spirits, even a passing word, unskilfully and feebly spoken,\r\nmight by God's blessing do good; and yielding to the impulse of the\r\nmoment, instead of declaiming the verses from Comus, I began to speak to\r\nthem in their own language, of those great truths, the most momentous\r\nfor civilised or savage man to know, and the most deeply interesting to\r\nevery thoughtful mind, of whatever degree of culture--truths so simple,\r\nthat even these untutored children of nature could receive, and be made\r\nhappy by them.\r\n\r\n\"In the plainest and simplest language I could command, and striving to\r\nadapt myself to their habits of thought, and to use those forms of\r\nexpression most familiar to them, I announced the great doctrine of the\r\nexistence of one God, the sole creator of the world, and the loving\r\nFather of all his creatures.  I spoke of his power and his goodness, and\r\ntold them that though invisible to our eyes, as the wind which stirred\r\nthe tops of the palm-trees above them, he was ever near each one of us,\r\nhearing our words, seeing our actions, reading our thoughts, and caring\r\nfor us continually.\r\n\r\n\"I endeavoured to illustrate these attributes of God, by references and\r\nallusions to the daily aspects of nature around them, and to ideas and\r\nnotions with which their mode of life, and the system of superstition in\r\nwhich they had been trained, rendered them familiar.  My especial aim\r\nwas to lead them, unconsciously, as it were, and without making any\r\ndirect attack upon their religion, to contrast the benignant character\r\nof Him who has permitted us to call Him `Our Father in Heaven,' with\r\nthat of the malignant beings they had been taught to worship.\r\n\r\n\"I next spoke of death, and of a future life, and assured them that the\r\nfriends whom they had buried, and they themselves, and all who had ever\r\nlived, should awake as from a brief sleep, and live again for ever.  But\r\nwhen I proceeded to declare that most awful and mysterious doctrine of\r\nour religion, and spoke of the worm that dieth not and the fire that is\r\nnot quenched, of eternal happiness, and unending woe, I could see by the\r\nearnestness of their attention, and the expression of their\r\ncountenances, how powerfully they were impressed.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot remember all that I said, or the language I used, but I\r\nendeavoured to set before them in a shape adapted to their\r\ncomprehension, the simple elements of the Christian scheme--the great\r\ndoctrines of God and immortality, of human sinfulness and\r\naccountability, and of salvation through Jesus Christ.  But encouraged\r\nby the attention and apparent interest of the silent and listening\r\ncircle, in the glow of the moment, I went beyond this prescribed limit,\r\nand from these vast general truths, I began at last to speak of\r\nparticular acts and practices.  As I thought once more of the marae in\r\nthe forest, and of the unhappy Malola, I told the people that our Father\r\nbeyond the sky could alone hear their prayers, and should alone be\r\nworshipped; that he desired no sacrifices of living things; that he was\r\noffended and displeased with all cruelty and bloodshed; and that the\r\noffering of human sacrifices, and the killing of aged persons, were\r\ncrimes which he detested, and would be sure to punish; that he had\r\nexpressly commanded children to love and honour their parents, and that\r\nit was their duty, the older, the more infirm and helpless they became,\r\nthe more faithfully to cherish and protect them.  In speaking on this\r\nsubject, I grew earnest and excited, and probably my voice and manner\r\ntoo strongly expressed the abhorrence I felt for such monstrous and\r\nunnatural crimes.\r\n\r\n\"At this point, Barton, who had for some time been looking on in\r\nastonishment at the serious turn which the matter had so unexpectedly\r\ntaken, interrupted me with the whispered caution--\r\n\r\n\"`Be careful, Arthur!  I fear from the black looks of one of your\r\nclerical fathers here, that you are giving offence to the cloth, and\r\ntrenching upon perilous ground.'\r\n\r\n\"But the warning came too late.  Just as I glanced round in search of\r\nthe threatening looks, to which Barton alluded, a frightful figure\r\nsprang up on the outer edge of the circle of listeners, directly in\r\nfront of me, and with cries of rage forced its way towards the spot\r\nwhere I stood.  I recognised at once the old priest of the marae, but\r\nhow changed since I last saw him!  Every sign of age and decrepitude had\r\nvanished: his misshapen frame seemed dilated, and instinct with nervous\r\nenergy: his face was pale with the intensity of his fury, and his small\r\neyes flashed fire.\r\n\r\n\"`Perish, reviler of Oro, and his priests!' he cried, and hurled at me a\r\nbarbed spear, with so true an aim, that if I had not stooped as it left\r\nhis hand, it would have struck my face.  Whizzing over my head, it\r\npierced the tough bark of a bread-fruit tree, ten yards behind me, where\r\nit stood quivering.  Instantly catching a club from the hands of a\r\nbystander, he rushed forward to renew the attack.  He had reached the\r\nfoot of the rock where I stood, when Rokoa with a bound placed himself\r\nbetween us, and though without any weapon, motioned him back, with a\r\ngesture so commanding, and an air at once so quiet, and so fearless,\r\nthat the priest paused.  But it was for an instant only; then, without\r\nuttering a word, he aimed a blow full at Rokoa's head.  The latter\r\ncaught it in his open palm, wrenched the weapon from him, and, adroitly\r\nfoiling a furious attempt which he made to grapple with him, once more\r\nstood upon the defensive with an unruffled aspect and not the slightest\r\nappearance of excitement in his manner.\r\n\r\n\"The baffled priest, livid with rage, looked round for another weapon.\r\nHalf a dozen of the men who had arrived upon the ground with him,\r\nuttered a wild yell, and pressed forward with brandished clubs and\r\nspears.  Barton and I, placed ourselves by Rokoa's side, the former\r\nhanding me one of his pistols.  All was tumult and confusion.  The\r\noutbreak had been so sudden and unexpected, and what I have just related\r\nhad passed so rapidly, that the bystanders had not yet recovered from\r\nthe first shock of astonishment and terror.  Of the women, some shrieked\r\nand fled from the spot, others threw themselves between us and the armed\r\nnatives, or invoked the interference of their brothers and friends for\r\nour protection.  Only a few, even of the men, seemed to participate in\r\nthe feeling of hostility against us.\r\n\r\n\"But however inferior in number, the party of our foes far surpassed\r\nthat of our friends in resolution and energy.  Foremost among them were\r\nthe priest and the hard-featured chief, who had been so deeply incensed\r\nby what he regarded as the wanton insults offered him by Barton.  A\r\nnumber of the young men also, whose anger and jealousy had been aroused\r\nby his sudden popularity, and the attention which had been paid us,\r\nsided zealously with the priest and his party, and joined in the clamour\r\nagainst us.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, Mowno, at Olla's entreaty, strove to calm the tumult, and to\r\npacify the leader and instigator of it; but his authority was fiercely\r\nspurned, and our good-natured protector quailed before the fury of the\r\nvindictive old man.  As yet, however, our enemies, conscious that the\r\nsympathies of a large number of the bystanders were with us, had offered\r\nus no actual violence, confining themselves to menacing cries and\r\ngestures, by which they seemed to be striving to work themselves up to\r\nthe requisite pitch of excitement.  This was likely to be speedily\r\nattained under the influence of the fierce exhortations and contagious\r\nfury of the priest.  Some of the young men, in fact, now commenced a\r\nsort of covert attack, by throwing stones and fragments of wood at us\r\nfrom the outskirts of the crowd, and Barton was struck violently in the\r\nmouth by one of these missiles, by which his lip was badly cut.  In the\r\nmidst of all the excitement and tumult, Rokoa stood, with the outward\r\nappearance at least, of perfect composure.  Neither the ravings of the\r\npriest, nor the menacing attitude of `Catiline,' nor the brandished\r\nweapons of their followers, deprived him of his coolness and presence of\r\nmind.  He steadily confronted them with an unblenching eye, grasping the\r\nclub of which he had possessed himself, in readiness to meet the attack,\r\nwhich he at the same time did nothing, by look or gesture, to provoke.\r\nHis calm intrepidity, while it seemed temporarily to restrain our\r\nenemies, served also to reassure and steady Barton and myself; and\r\nendeavouring to emulate his self-possession, we stood ready to act as\r\ncircumstances should indicate, looking to him for the example.\"\r\n\r\nHere Arthur paused, as if about to suspend his narrative.  Johnny, who\r\nwas now broad awake, and listening eagerly, waited patiently a few\r\nmoments, expecting him to recommence.  Finding, however, that he did not\r\ndo so, he at length asked him to \"go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is getting quite late,\" answered Arthur; \"see, those three bright\r\nstars which were high in the heavens when we first sat down here, are\r\nnow on the very edge of the horizon, about to sink behind the ocean.  As\r\nwe expect to be up, and on our way to Castle-hill before sunrise\r\nto-morrow.  I think we should now go to rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we do,\" replied Johnny, \"I am sure I shall not be able to sleep; I\r\nshall be thinking of that terrible old priest, and trying to guess how\r\nyou escaped at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"I judge,\" said Browne, \"that you are pretty nearly at the end of your\r\nadventures in Angatan, so pray let us have the remainder now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so,\" added Morton, \"and set Johnny's mind at rest, or he will be\r\ndreaming of cannibals and cannibal-priests all night, and disturbing us\r\nby crying out in his sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it's quite likely,\" said Johnny, shaking his head in a\r\nthreatening manner; \"I feel just now very much as if I should.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since that is the case,\" said Arthur, \"I suppose I must `go on,' in\r\nself-defence; and as I believe that twenty minutes will suffice for what\r\nremains, I will finish it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE FLIGHT.\r\n\r\nTE VEA--THE VICTIM FOR SACRIFICE--THE ESCAPE AND PURSUIT--THE PRIEST'S\r\nAMBUSH.\r\n\r\n  \"For life, for life, their flight they ply,\r\n  And shriek, and shout, and battle-cry,\r\n  And weapons waving to the sky,\r\n  Are maddening in their rear.\"\r\n\r\n\"While the party hostile to us, thus stood hesitating, but to all\r\nappearance rapidly approaching a point where all hesitation would cease,\r\nOlla, with tears streaming down her cheeks, besought us to fly to her\r\nhusband's house, where, she seemed to imagine, we should necessarily be\r\nsafe from violence.  But though no one yet laid hands on us, we were\r\nsurrounded on all sides, and could not with any certainty distinguish\r\nfriends from foes; and the first movement on our part to escape, would\r\nprobably be the signal for an instant and general attack by the priest\r\nand his followers.  We thought, therefore, that our best hope of safety\r\nlay in maintaining a firm but quiet attitude, until Mowno, and those\r\ndisposed to protect us, could make their influence felt in our behalf.\r\nThey, however, confined their efforts to feeble expostulations and\r\nentreaties; and perhaps it was unreasonable to expect them to engage in\r\na deadly conflict with their own neighbours, relatives, and personal\r\nfriends, in the defence of mere strangers like ourselves.  They could\r\nnot even restrain the younger and more violent portion of the rabble\r\nfrom carrying on the species of desultory warfare, from which Barton had\r\nalready suffered; on the contrary, the stones and other missiles, thrown\r\nby persons on the outskirts of the crowd, fell continually thicker and\r\nfaster.  At length Rokoa received a staggering blow on the back of the\r\nhead, from a clod of earth, thrown by some one who had stolen round\r\nbehind the rock for that purpose, and who immediately afterwards\r\ndisappeared in the throng.\r\n\r\n\"`How much longer are we to endure this?' cried Barton.  `Must we stand\r\nhere and suffer ourselves to be murdered by these cowardly attacks?  Let\r\nus shoot a couple of them, and make a rush for the shore.'\r\n\r\n\"But a moment's reflection was enough to show the utter hopelessness of\r\nsuch an attempt.  However much the natives might be astounded for an\r\ninstant by the discharge of fire-arms, all fear and hesitation would\r\nvanish upon our taking to flight.  Our backs once turned would be the\r\nmark for a score of ready spears; and except perhaps for Rokoa, whose\r\nspeed was extraordinary, there would be scarcely the possibility for\r\nescape.  Still it was evident that the audacity of our enemies was\r\nsteadily increasing, though their attacks were as yet covert and\r\nindirect, and, as I knew that Rokoa would not hesitate to retaliate upon\r\nthe first open assailant, in which case we should be massacred upon the\r\nspot, we might soon be compelled to adopt even so desperate a\r\nsuggestion, as the only alternative of instant death.\r\n\r\n\"At this critical moment, I noticed a sudden movement of surprise or\r\nalarm, on the outskirts of the crowd.  A group, directly in front of us,\r\nno longer giving us their exclusive attention, began to whisper among\r\nthemselves, glancing and pointing towards the rising ground in our rear,\r\nwhile a half suppressed and shuddering exclamation of `Te Vea!  Te Vea!'\r\nwas heard among the people.  Turning round, and looking where all eyes\r\nwere now directed, I saw a tall native, with a peculiar head-dress of\r\nfeathers, and a small basket of cocoa-nut-leaflets in his hand, running\r\nrapidly towards us.  His appearance seemed to awaken in those around us,\r\nemotions of terror or aversion, strong enough to swallow up every other\r\nfeeling, for, no sooner was he perceived, than all thought of\r\nprosecuting further the present quarrel, appeared to be abandoned.  The\r\npriest, alone, evinced none of the general uneasiness or dread, but, on\r\nthe contrary, a gleam of exultation lighted up his hard and discoloured\r\ncountenance.  The people made way to the right and left, as the\r\nnew-comer drew near, and a number of them slunk away into the forest or\r\nto their homes.  The stranger proceeded directly towards Mowno, and\r\ntaking a small parcel wrapped in leaves, from the basket which he\r\ncarried, delivered it to him: then, without pausing an instant, or\r\nuttering a word, he passed on, taking his way at a rapid pace straight\r\nthrough the village.  Mowno received the parcel with a reluctant and\r\ngloomy air, though it seemed to consist of nothing but a rough stone,\r\nwrapped in the leaves of the sacred miro.  For several minutes he stood\r\nholding it in his hand, like one deprived of consciousness.  Several of\r\nthose who appeared to be the principal persons present, among whom were\r\nCatiline and the priest, now approached him, and they began to hold a\r\nwhispered consultation, in the course of which the priest frequently\r\npointed towards Rokoa, as though speaking of him.  Mowno seemed to be\r\nresisting some proposal urged by the others, and spoke in a more\r\ndecisive and resolute manner than I had thought him capable of assuming.\r\nThe discussion, whatever was its subject, soon became warm and angry:\r\nthe voices of Catiline and the priest were raised, and even threatening.\r\nEvery moment I expected to see Mowno relinquish his opposition; but he\r\nremained firm, and at last, with the air of one resolved to put an end\r\nto further debate, he said--\r\n\r\n\"`No! it shall not be either of the strangers; it shall be Terano: he is\r\nan evil man, and it will be well when he is gone.'  Then speaking to two\r\nof those who stood near him, he said, `Go quickly to Terano's house,\r\nbefore he sees the messenger and hides himself in the mountains,'\r\nwhereupon they seized their spears, and immediately set off in the\r\ndirection of the village.\r\n\r\n\"Olla now renewed her entreaties for us to leave the spot, and go with\r\nher to the house; and Mowno,--by a quick gesture, meant to be seen only\r\nby us, indicated his wish to the same effect.  Rokoa nodded to me to\r\ncomply, and we followed Olla as she bounded lightly through the grove,\r\nno one offering to oppose our departure.  But the priest's restless eye\r\nwas upon us, and had we set off in the direction of the shore, we should\r\nnot have been permitted to escape, without an attempt on his part to\r\nprevent it.  As it was, he appeared to give some direction to those\r\nabout him, and four or five young men followed us at a distance, keeping\r\nus in sight, and taking care that they were always in such a position as\r\nto enable them to intercept us in any attempt to recross the island.\r\nAfter having dogged us to Mowno's house and seen us enter, they withdrew\r\ninto the forest out of sight, where they probably remained on the watch.\r\nRokoa now proceeded to select from Mowno's store of weapons, a club, of\r\nmore formidable weight and size, than that which he had wrested from the\r\npriest, and requested Barton and myself to follow his example.\r\n\r\n\"`We must try to get to the shore,' he said, `there are at present, none\r\nto hinder us, but the young men who followed us hither.'\r\n\r\n\"`But that demon of a priest, and the rest of his crew, are not\r\nfar-off,' said Barton, `and they will be sure to waylay us.  For the\r\npresent we are safe here; and perhaps Mowno will be able to get us back\r\nto our boat without danger.'\r\n\r\n\"Rokoa shook his head.  `There are others here,' he said, `more powerful\r\nthan Mowno, and who are our enemies: we must rely upon ourselves.'\r\n\r\n\"Olla watched us anxiously during this conversation; and now, as if she\r\nunderstood its subject at least, she said, with an expression of\r\nintelligence and cordial friendliness in her fine eyes, `Listen to me:\r\nthe words of the priest are more powerful with the great chief than the\r\nwords of Mowno: to-night, the priest will go to the great chief, and\r\nbefore he returns you must fly; but not now, for you are watched by the\r\nyoung men; you must wait until night--until the moon is behind the\r\ngrove.'\r\n\r\n\"This seemed to me a wiser course than to undertake, at present, to\r\nfight our way to the boat; but Rokoa remained of his former opinion; he\r\napprehended an attack upon our party at the shore during our absence, by\r\nwhich we might be cut off from all means of leaving the island.  This\r\ncertainly was a weighty consideration, and one that had not occurred to\r\nme.  We were still hesitating, and uncertain what course to pursue, when\r\nMowno came in, looking much troubled, and carrying in his hand the\r\nmysterious package, the object and meaning of which I forgot to explain.\r\n\r\n\"A stone, folded in the leaves of the miro, sent by the king, or\r\nparamount chief, to the subordinate chiefs of districts or villages, is\r\nthe customary method of notifying the latter that they are expected to\r\nfurnish a human victim for some approaching sacrifice.  The principal\r\noccasions upon which these are required, are at the building of national\r\nmaraes, at the commencement of a war, or in cases of the serious illness\r\nof a superior chief.  The number of victims sacrificed, is proportioned\r\nto the magnitude of the occasion; as many as a score have sometimes been\r\noffered to propitiate the gods during the severe sickness of a powerful\r\nchief.  The priests signify to the chief the number required; the latter\r\nthen sends out his runner or messenger, (te vea), who delivers to each\r\nof the subordinate chiefs, one of these packages for each victim to be\r\nfurnished from his immediate district.  The odious duty of designating\r\nthe individuals to be taken, then devolves upon the subordinate, and\r\nhaving decided upon this, he sends a number of armed men to secure the\r\ndestined victims before they secrete themselves or flee into the woods,\r\nas those who have any reason to fear being selected generally do, at the\r\nfirst appearance of the dreaded messenger, or even as soon as it is\r\npublicly known that an occasion is at hand for which human sacrifices\r\nwill be required.  When secured, the doomed persons are most commonly\r\nkilled on the spot by the chief's men, and the bodies wrapped in\r\ncocoa-nut leaves and carried to the temple.  Sometimes, however, they\r\nare preserved alive, and slain by the priests themselves at the altar.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the arrival of the messenger, as already related, with a\r\nrequisition for one victim from the village, the majority of Mowno's\r\nadvisers had insisted upon selecting Rokoa for that purpose, and thus\r\navoiding the necessity of sacrificing one of their own people.  The\r\npriest had gone further still, and proposed to seize upon us all, and\r\nsend Barton and myself to the two neighbouring villages, to be furnished\r\nby them as their quota of victims.  To these councils, Mowno had opposed\r\na determined resistance, and he had finally sent his followers to\r\ndespatch an old man named Terano, whose death would be considered a\r\ngeneral benefit, as he was a notorious and inveterate thief and\r\ndrunkard, who, when not stupefied with ava, was constantly engaged in\r\ndesperate broils, or wanton depredations upon the property of his\r\nneighbours.  It seemed, however, that the old man had taken the alarm\r\nand fled; several of Mowno's followers were now in pursuit of him, and\r\nunless they should succeed in taking him before morning, another person\r\nwould have to be designated, as it was required to furnish the victims\r\nat the great marae, by noon of the following day.\r\n\r\n\"I sickened with disgust, as I listened to details like these.  Never\r\nbefore had I so fully realised the darkness and the horrors of\r\nheathenism--all the more striking in the present instance, because of\r\nthe many pleasing and amiable natural qualities of the people who groped\r\namid much darkness, and were a prey to such horrors.\r\n\r\n\"Mowno also recommended us to postpone any attempt at flight until a\r\nlate hour of the night.  He said that he had seen a number of men\r\nlurking in the woods near the stream, and that the priest and others had\r\nremained in the grove after he had left, probably with the intention of\r\njoining them in watching the house.\r\n\r\n\"Olla now went out into the garden, where she walked about looking up\r\namong the branches of the tree; and calling out, `Lai-evi!' as if in\r\nsearch of her tame wood-pigeon.  After going round the garden, she\r\npassed out of the gate, and wandered away in the direction of the brook,\r\nstill looking among the trees, and repeating at intervals her call of\r\n`Lai-evi!'\r\n\r\n\"By-and-bye she returned, and though without her little favourite, she\r\nhad accomplished her real object, and ascertained the number and\r\nposition of the spies.  She had seen seven of them skulking in the wood\r\nalong the brook, and watching the house.  They seemed anxious to avoid\r\nobservation, and she could not, without awaking suspicion, get more than\r\ntransient glimpses of them, so that possibly there might be others whom\r\nshe had not seen.\r\n\r\n\"Rokoa questioned her as to the space along the bank of the stream\r\noccupied by these men, and the distance from one another at which they\r\nwere stationed.  Then after a moment's reflection he turned to Mowno,\r\nand asked whether he was confident of being able to protect us, while in\r\nhis house; to which the latter replied with much earnestness that he\r\nboth could and would do so.\r\n\r\n\"`Wait here, then,' said Rokoa, addressing Barton and myself, `I will\r\nreturn before the moon sets:' and without affording us an opportunity to\r\ninquire what he designed to do, he passed through the door, and bounded\r\ninto the forest, in the direction opposite to that where the spies of\r\nthe priest were lurking.\r\n\r\n\"`Is it possible,' said Barton, `that he intends to desert us?'\r\n\r\n\"`You should know him better,' I answered, `unless I am mistaken, he is\r\nabout to risk his life in an attempt to communicate with our crew, in\r\norder to put them on their guard against a surprise, and to render our\r\nescape the more easy.  If he lives, he will return, to incur a second\r\ntime with us, the very dangers to which this attempt exposes him.'\r\n\r\n\"Knowing as I did Rokoa's great activity, coolness, and presence of\r\nmind, I was sanguine that he would succeed in eluding the vigilance of\r\nour enemies, and accomplishing his purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after his departure, Olla set out for our evening meal a light\r\nrepast of bananas, baked bread-fruit, and vi-apples, fresh from the\r\ngarden.  But neither Barton nor I could eat anything: our thoughts were\r\nwith Rokoa upon his perilous adventure.  When the food had been removed,\r\nMowno suggested that we should all go out into the inclosure, and walk a\r\nfew times around the house in order that those who were on the watch\r\nmight be satisfied that we were still there.  This we accordingly did,\r\nand continued strolling through the garden until it became quite dark.\r\nRokoa had now been gone nearly an hour, and Barton began to grow\r\nrestless and troubled.  Mowno, stationing himself at the end of the walk\r\nleading from the house, leaned upon the gate in a listening attitude.\r\nAs I sat in the wide doorway, beneath the vi-apple trees planted on\r\neither side of the entrance, watching the bright constellation of the\r\nCross, just visible above the outline of the grove in the southern\r\nhorizon, Olla began to question me concerning what I had told the people\r\nin the afternoon, of God, and a future life, and the doctrines of\r\nChristianity.  I was at once touched and astonished, to perceive the\r\ndeep interest she took in the subject, and the readiness with which she\r\nreceived these truths, as something she had needed and longed for.  She\r\nseemed to feel how much better and more consoling they were, than the\r\nsuperstitions in which she had been educated.\r\n\r\n\"I was amazed to find that this young heathen woman, growing up in the\r\nmidst of pagan darkness, was nevertheless possessed of deep and strong\r\nreligious feelings, which could not be satisfied with the traditions of\r\nher people.  As I gazed at her ingenuous countenance, full of\r\nearnestness and sensibility, while she endeavoured to express the vague\r\nthoughts on these subjects which had at times floated through her mind,\r\nI could scarcely believe that this was the same gay and careless being,\r\nwhose life had seemed to be as natural, as unconscious, and as joyous,\r\nas that of a bird or a flower.  She said, that often when alone in some\r\nsecluded spot in the depth of the wood, while all around was so hushed\r\nand peaceful, she had suddenly burst into tears, feeling that what she\r\nhad been taught of the gods could not be true, and that if Oro was\r\nindeed the creator of so beautiful a world--if he had made the smiling\r\ngroves, the bright flowers, and the multitude of happy living things, he\r\nmust be a good being, who could not delight in the cruelties practised\r\nin his name.  Often, when a mere girl, thoughts like these had visited\r\nher, wandering by the sea-shore at twilight, or looking up through the\r\nfoliage of waving cocoa-nut-groves at the starry skies, when nature\r\nherself, by her harmony and beauty, had seemed to proclaim that God was\r\na being of light and love, in whom was no darkness at all!\r\n\r\n\"Presently Mowno joined us, and I talked with him in regard to the\r\nintended burial of the aged woman, his aunt and endeavoured to make him\r\nsee the act in its true light.  But with all his natural amiability,\r\nsuch was the effect of custom and education, that he seemed perfectly\r\ninsensible on the subject.  He observed, in a cool, matter-of-fact\r\nmanner, that when people got very old and could not work, they were of\r\nno use to others or themselves--that it was then time for them to die,\r\nand much best that they should do so at once; and that if they did not,\r\nthen their friends ought to bury them.  As to Malola, his aunt, he said\r\nthat she was quite willing to be buried, and had in fact suggested it\r\nherself; that she was often very sick, and in great pain, so that she\r\nhad no pleasure in living any longer; he added, as another grave and\r\nweighty consideration, that she had lost most of her teeth, and could\r\nnot chew her food, unless it was prepared differently from that of the\r\nrest of the family, which caused Olla much trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Finding that argument and expostulation had not the slightest effect\r\nupon him, I changed my tactics, and suddenly demanded whether he would\r\nbe willing to have Olla buried, when _she_ began to get old and infirm?\r\nThis seemed at first to startle him.  He glanced uneasily at his little\r\nwife, as if it had never before occurred to him that she _could_ grow\r\nold.  Then, after staring at me a moment in a half angry manner, as\r\nthough offended at my having suggested so disagreeable an idea, he\r\nseemed all at once to recover himself, remarking quickly, that _he_\r\nshould be old then, too, and that they could both be buried together.\r\nThis consolatory reflection seemed completely to neutralise the effect\r\nof my last attack, and Mowno's countenance resumed its habitual\r\nexpression of calm and somewhat stolid placidity.\r\n\r\n\"Baffled, but not discouraged, I next strove, by drawing an imaginary\r\npicture of Olla and himself in their old age, surrounded by their grown\r\nup children, to show how happy and beautiful the relation between the\r\nchild and the aged parent might be.  I summoned up all my rhetorical\r\npowers, and sketched what I conceived to be a perfect model of an\r\naffectionate and dutiful Angatanese son.  After clothing him with all\r\nthe virtues and accomplishments of the savage character, I proceeded to\r\nendue him with that filial affection, whose beauty and power it was my\r\nchief object to illustrate.  I represented him as loving his father and\r\nmother all the more tenderly on account of the infirmities of age now\r\nstealing over them.  Upon the arm of this affectionate son, the\r\nwhite-haired Mowno supported himself; when at morning and evening he\r\nwent forth to take his accustomed walk in the groves.  He it was, who\r\nbrought home daily to his aged mother, the ripest fruits, and the\r\nfreshest flowers.  His smiling and happy countenance was the light of\r\ntheir dwelling; his cheerful voice, its sweetest music.  I was\r\nproceeding thus in quite an affecting strain, as it seemed to me,\r\n(though I must in honesty confess that Mowno appeared to be less moved\r\nby it than myself; and somewhat cooled my enthusiasm by giving a great\r\nyawn in the midst of one of the most touching passages), when Olla, who\r\nhad been listening with moistened eyes, gently stole her arm around her\r\nhusband's neck, and murmured a few words in his ear.  Whether it was my\r\npathetic eloquence, or Olla's caress, that melted his hitherto obdurate\r\nheart, I will not pretend to say, but it is certain that he now yielded\r\nthe point, and promised that Malola should be permitted to live.  `At\r\nleast,' he added, after a moment's reflection, `as long as she can see,\r\nand walk about.'\r\n\r\n\"Several times, since it had grown dark, I had heard sounds like the\r\ndistant beating of drums, mingled occasionally with the long and\r\nsorrowful note of the buccinum-shell, or native trumpet.  Twice, also,\r\nwhile Mowno was standing at his gate, messengers had arrived, apparently\r\nin haste, and after briefly conferring with him, had posted off again.\r\nWhen I remarked upon these sounds, Mowno said that they came from the\r\nmarae, where preparations for the approaching ceremony were going\r\nforward; but to me, they seemed to proceed from several different\r\npoints, at various distances from us.\r\n\r\n\"I now began to feel painfully anxious at Rokoa's protracted absence.\r\nIt was nearly midnight, and there had been ample time for one less\r\nactive than he, to go to the shore and return.  The terrible\r\napprehension, that in spite of all the resources of his skill and\r\ncourage, he had fallen into the hands of some of the parties of natives\r\nwhich seemed to be scattered about in the forest, gained every moment a\r\nstronger hold upon my mind.\r\n\r\n\"`He has either been taken, or else he finds that he cannot rejoin us,\r\nwithout too great risk,' said Barton, breaking a long silence, and\r\nspeaking of that which each knew the other to be thinking about; `we\r\nmust start for the shore ourselves, if he does not come soon.'\r\n\r\n\"`Hark!' whispered Olla, `some one is approaching from the wood.'  Her\r\nquick ear had detected stealthy steps crossing the avenue.  The next\r\nmoment some one bounded lightly over the hedge at the side of the house,\r\nwhere the shadow of the bread-fruit trees fell darkest.  Mowno started,\r\nand seemed agitated, and for an instant a suspicion that he had betrayed\r\nus, and was about to give us up, flashed through my mind.  But the\r\nfigure which came forward into the light, was that of Rokoa, and I felt\r\npained at the wrong which my momentary doubts had done our inert, but\r\nwell-meaning, host.  Rokoa breathed quick and short.  Without speaking,\r\nhe pointed to the moon, now on the edge of the western horizon of\r\nforest, to intimate that he was punctual to the time set for his return.\r\n\r\n\"The sounds which I had before heard, were now borne more plainly than\r\never to our ears upon the night breeze.  As soon as Rokoa recovered his\r\nbreath, he said that we had not a moment to lose, but must commence our\r\nflight at once.  He had passed an armed party of more than twenty men,\r\ncoming in the direction of the house, with the purpose, as he supposed,\r\nof demanding that we should be given up to them.  Mowno seemed more\r\ndispleased than alarmed at this intelligence, and earnestly repeated\r\nthat no harm should befall us while beneath his roof, if he had to lay\r\ndown his life in our defence.  But Rokoa urged our immediate departure,\r\nbefore the arrival of the party which he had seen.  Mowno then offered\r\nto accompany, and guide us to our boat, which Rokoa firmly declined, on\r\nthe ground that his presence might endanger him, and, in the excited and\r\ndetermined mood of our enemies, could be no protection to us.\r\n\r\n\"We accordingly took a hurried leave of him, and Olla.  `Good-bye,\r\nArtua,' said the latter, `Olla will not forget what you have told her of\r\nour great Father in the sky; she will ask him for a new heart that she\r\ntoo, may go when she dies, to the Christian heaven,' and she pointed\r\nupward, while a happy smile lighted up her intelligent, and, for the\r\nmoment, serious countenance.\r\n\r\n\"We sprang over the hedge, and, Rokoa leading the way, proceeded swiftly\r\nbut silently down the avenue.  We passed some distance beyond the point\r\nwhere we had struck into it in the morning, to avoid the neighbourhood\r\nof the village, then turning towards the shore, descended into the\r\nvalley until we reached the stream.  At this point, it was deep and\r\nnarrow, with a rapid current, but we had no time to look for a ford.\r\nCries and shouts on the hill above us, showed that we were pursued, and\r\na confused clamour from the village indicated the existence of some\r\nunusual commotion there.  Tum-tums were beating fiercely, and the long\r\ndismal wail of the tuba-conch resounded through the echoing arches of\r\nthe forest.  We swam the stream as silently as possible, Barton holding\r\nhis pistols above his head in one hand to keep the charges dry.  As we\r\nclimbed the further bank, and plunged into the wood of miros, we could\r\nhear the splashing of the water caused by persons fording the brook a\r\nshort distance below us, and opposite the village.  In the same\r\ndirection a multitude of candle-nut torches gleamed through the foliage,\r\nand revealed dusky forms hurrying hither and thither.  We pushed on\r\nthrough the wood at the top of our speed, until suddenly the outlines of\r\nthe marae, illuminated by the glare of a large bonfire, loomed up before\r\nus.  A score of half-naked men, were dancing around the fire in front of\r\nthe inclosure, with the wildest and most extravagant contortions of\r\nbody.  Seen by the fitful and wavering light, their painted countenances\r\nscarcely looked like those of human beings, and the grim, immovable\r\nidols, upon their pedestals, seemed vaster and more hideous than ever.\r\n\r\n\"As we turned, and plunged into the grove again, resuming our flight in\r\na somewhat altered direction, an eager shout announced that we had been\r\nseen.  But this cry proceeded, not from the group in front of the marae,\r\nwho were wholly absorbed in their savage orgies, but from a straggling\r\nparty of pursuers from the village, to whom the light of the bonfire had\r\nbetrayed us.  The chase was now no longer random or uncertain; they came\r\non like hounds in full view of the game, uttering yells that caused the\r\nblood to curdle in my veins.  My strength began to fail, and I felt a\r\nhorrible spell creeping over me, like that which often in dreams,\r\ndeprives us of the power to fly some appalling danger.  Rokoa restrained\r\nhis superior speed, and kept beside Barton and myself.  `Courage,\r\nArtua!' he said, `we are near the shore,' and he offered me his hand to\r\nassist me, but I would not take it.  Notwithstanding our utmost\r\nexertions our pursuers gained upon us.  I was very nearly exhausted when\r\nwe reached the ravine which divided the miro-grove from the bread-fruit\r\nplantation, and, as we struggled up its steep side, Barton panted and\r\ngasped so painfully for breath, that I dreaded each moment to see him\r\nfall to the ground incapable of proceeding further.  But we knew that\r\nour lives were at stake, and forced ourselves to exertions which nature\r\ncould not long support; still, the cries of our pursuers, the sound of\r\ntheir footsteps, and the crashing of branches in their path, drew\r\ncontinually nearer.\r\n\r\n\"At last we had nearly traversed the breadth of the plantation, and the\r\nwelcome sound of the waves, breaking upon the beach, greeted our ears.\r\nSafety now seemed within our reach, and we summoned all our remaining\r\nenergies for a final effort.  The trees, growing more thinly as we\r\napproached the skirt of the wood, let in the light, and between their\r\ntrunks I caught a glimpse of the sea.  Right before us was a thicket,\r\ntangled with fern, and scarcely twenty yards beyond it lay the beach\r\nshining in the star-light.  As we turned a little aside to avoid the\r\nthicket, an appalling yell rang out from it, and half a dozen dark\r\nfigures started from their ambush, and sprang into the path before us.\r\nThe old priest was at their head: my heart sank, and I gave up all as\r\nhost.  Rokoa, swinging up his ponderous club, bounded into their midst.\r\n`Onward!' cried he, `it is our only hope of escape.'  His movements were\r\nlight as those of a bird, and rapid as lightning.  His first blow\r\nstretched the priest at his feet.  The savages gave way before him,\r\nscattering to the right and left, as if a thunderbolt had fallen among\r\nthem.  Barton discharged both his pistols at once, and with fatal\r\neffect, as was witnessed by the groans that followed.  Before they could\r\nrally or recover themselves, we had burst through their midst.  As we\r\nreached the shore, I looked round and missed Barton--he was no longer\r\nbeside me.  An exulting cry behind us at once explained his absence: at\r\nthe same time we could hear him call out in a voice broken by\r\nexhaustion, `Save yourselves, you can do nothing for me!'  Without an\r\ninstant's hesitation, Rokoa turned, and we rushed back into the midst of\r\nour shouting enemies.  Three or four of the party which had been in\r\npursuit of us, were just coming up.  The audacity and desperation of our\r\nattack seemed to confound them, and two of their number fell, almost\r\nwithout a struggle, beneath Rokoa's rapid and resistless blows.  Two\r\nmore of them, who were dragging Barton away, were compelled to leave him\r\nat liberty in order to defend themselves.  At that moment a sudden shout\r\nfrom the water raised by our crew, who had either heard our voices, or\r\nseen us when we came out upon the shore, increased their panic by\r\ncausing them to suppose that we were leading back our whole party to the\r\nfight.  They hastily gave way before us, and we had all turned once\r\nmore, and gained the beach before they recovered from their surprise,\r\nand perceived their mistake.\r\n\r\n\"Our boat was just outside the surf; where the crew were keeping her\r\nsteady with their paddles.  We hailed them, and plunged in the water to\r\nswim out to them.  The natives, stung with shame and rage at having\r\ntheir prisoner torn from them in the very moment of triumph, with such\r\nreckless boldness, swarmed down to the beach and pursued us into the\r\nwater.  They seemed excited almost to frenzy at the prospect of our\r\nescape.  Some standing upon the shore assailed the canoe with showers of\r\nstones, by which several of our men were wounded.  Others swam out after\r\nus, as if about to endeavour to board the vessel, and did not turn back\r\nuntil we had hoisted our sail, and began to draw steadily from the land.\r\n\r\n\"And thus ends the story of the Cannibal Island of Angatan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" inquired Johnny, looking somewhat disappointed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is all,\" answered Arthur, \"it comes as near to being a\r\ncannibal story, as any thing I know.  I did not see any one actually\r\nroasted and eaten, but if the savages had caught us, I suspect there\r\nwould have been more to tell, and probably no one here to tell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" persisted Johnny, \"the story don't end there.  You haven't told\r\nus about the rest of the voyage, and whether Rokoa found his brother at\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, that don't properly belong to _this_ story.  According to all\r\nartistical rules I ought to end precisely where I have, in order to\r\npreserve the unities.  But some other time, if you wish, I will tell you\r\nall about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray don't talk of artistical rules,\" exclaimed Max, \"after showing\r\nyourself such an egregious bungler!  You had there all the elements of a\r\ncapital story, and you have just spoiled them.\"\r\n\r\n\"`How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge,'\" cried\r\nBrowne, \"`come now, unmuzzle your wisdom,' and specify the blunders of\r\nwhich he has been guilty.  I say, with Touchstone, `instance briefly,\r\nshepherd; come, instance.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, in the first place, there was a miserly spirit of economy in\r\nregard to his men.  He should have invested the narrative with a tragic\r\ninterest, by killing Rokoa and Barton, at least;--being the narrator he\r\ncouldn't kill himself conveniently;--but he might, with good effect have\r\nbeen `dangerously wounded.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose,\" said Arthur, \"that I wanted Rokoa to figure in a future\r\nstory, and so couldn't afford to kill him just yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"A miserable apology! it evinces a lamentable poverty of imagination to\r\nmake one character serve for two distinct tales.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a further instance, `gentle shepherd,'\" cried Browne, \"`a more\r\nsounder instance.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, again,\" resumed Max, with an oracular air, \"it was a capital\r\nerror to make Olla a married woman; what business I should like to know,\r\ncan a married woman have in a story?--She belongs properly to the dull\r\nprosaic region of common life--not to the fairy land of romance.  Now\r\nthe charm of sentiment is as necessary to a perfect tale, as the\r\ninterest of adventure, or the excitement of conflict, and had Olla been\r\nsingle, there would have been the elements of something beautifully\r\nsentimental.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\" cried Browne, \"if you have not `lamed me with reasons,' you\r\nhave at least overwhelmed me with words--there now!  I believe I am\r\nunconsciously catching the trick of your long-winded sing-song\r\nsentences--it must be contagious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Arthur, \"I give over the `materials' to Max, with full\r\npermission to work them up into a romance after his own fashion,\r\nintroducing as much slaughter and sentiment as he shall judge requisite\r\nfor the best effect, and when completed, it shall be inserted by way of\r\nepisode in our narrative.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNote.  Upon consulting the charts we find an island called \"Ahangatan\",\r\n(of which Angatan is perhaps a contraction), laid down on some of them,\r\nabout one hundred and fifty miles north of Hao.  On others the same\r\nisland is called Ahangatoff.  The US Exploring Expedition visited Hae,\r\nand most of the neighbouring islands, but we have not been able to\r\ndiscover any mention of Angatan in the published records of the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nHOUSE-BUILDING.\r\n\r\nDAWN ON THE LAGOON--THE \"SEA-ATTORNEY\"--THE \"SHARK-EXTERMINATOR\"--MAX\r\n\"CARRIES THE WAR INTO AFRICA.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Another hour must pass ere day grows bright,\r\n  And ere the little birds begin discourse\r\n  In quick low voices, ere the streaming light\r\n  Pours on their nests, just sprung from day's fresh source.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the late hours we had kept on the last evening, most of us would\r\nwillingly have prolonged our slumbers beyond the time previously fixed\r\nfor setting out upon our return to Castle-hill.  But before it was\r\nfairly light, Arthur was up, with an unseasonable and provoking\r\nalacrity, calling loudly upon us to bestir ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn vain Browne apostrophised him in moving strains as \"the rude\r\ndisturber of his pillow,\" remonstrated against such unmerciful\r\npunctuality, and petitioned for another nap; in vain Max protested that\r\nwe were not New York shop-boys, obliged to rise at daylight to make\r\nfires, and open and sweep out stores, but free and independent desert\r\nislanders, who had escaped from the bondage of civilised life, and the\r\nshackles of slavish routine, and who need not get up until noon, unless\r\nof our own good pleasure.  Arthur was inexorable, and finding that\r\nfurther sleep was out of the question, we yielded at last to his\r\ndespotic pertinacity, and groped our way into the boat, yawning\r\ndesperately, and not more than half awake.\r\n\r\nThe sea-fowl had not yet begun to stir in their nests, when we pushed\r\nout into the lagoon, and commenced pulling homeward--as we had now\r\nalmost come to regard it--holding a course midway between the reef and\r\nthe shore.  A few moments' exercise at the oars sufficed to dispel our\r\ndrowsiness, and to reconcile us somewhat to the early start, which we\r\nhad so reluctantly taken.\r\n\r\nThe faint grey light revealed the sleeping landscape, invested with the\r\ndelicious freshness and repose of the earliest dawn in summer.  The\r\nshores of the island, with their dense masses of verdure, were so\r\nperfectly mirrored in the lagoon, that the peculiar characteristics of\r\nthe different kinds of foliage could be distinguished in their\r\nreflections.  The drooping plumes of the palms, the lance-shaped\r\npandanus leaves, and the delicate, filmy foliage of the casuarina, were\r\nall accurately imaged there; the inverted shore below, with its fringe\r\nof trees and shrubbery, looking scarcely less substantial and real, than\r\nits counterpart above.  But as the light increased, these reflections\r\nlost their softness, and the clearness of their outlines.  The gradually\r\nbrightening dawn, cast new and rapidly changing lights and shades upon\r\nthe waters and the shores; and the latter, which, as we moved onward, we\r\nbeheld every moment from a new point of view, charmed the eye with a\r\nperpetual variety.  In some places they were abrupt and bold; in others\r\nsmoothly rounded, or gently sloping.  Now we were opposite a jutting\r\npromontory, which, crowned with verdure, and overgrown with pendulous\r\nand creeping plants, pushed out over the narrow alluvial belt of shore,\r\nto the water's edge; now shooting past it, we caught a sudden and\r\ntransient glimpse of some cool valley, opening down to the lagoon, and\r\nstretching away inland through vistas of fine trees.\r\n\r\nJohnny expressed a fervent wish that he was a painter, in order that we\r\nmight sail round the island, take sketches of the scenery, and then\r\npaint a panorama, embracing all the best views, by exhibiting which at\r\ntwenty-five cents a head, we should all make our fortunes upon getting\r\nhome.  He appeared to have some doubts, however, whether that particular\r\ntime of day could be painted, even by the most accomplished artist.  The\r\nlagoon channel wound through fields of branching coral trees of\r\nluxuriant growth, among which, numbers of large fish were moving\r\nsluggishly about, as if they had got up too early, and were more than\r\nhalf inclined to indulge in another nap.  As we passed over a sort of\r\nbar, where there was not more than a fathom and a half of water, we\r\nespied an immense green turtle at the bottom, quietly pursuing his way\r\nacross our track, and though by no means a beautiful creature, looking\r\ninfinitely happier and more lively than the dull-eyed wretches of his\r\nrace, which I have seen lying on their backs, at the doors of the New\r\nYork restaurants, ready to be converted into soup and steaks.  Johnny\r\nmourned over the impracticability of making any attempt at his capture,\r\nand heaved a sigh which seemed to come from the bottom of his heart, as\r\nthe unsightly reptile disappeared among the mazes of the submarine\r\nshrubbery.  The hardship of the case, seemed to be greatly aggravated in\r\nhis eyes, as he contrasted it with the better fortune of Robinson Crusoe\r\nand the Swiss Family, the former of whom, as he reminded us, caught \"any\r\nquantity of turtles\" on the beach of his island, with no other trouble\r\nthan that of turning them over upon their backs; while the latter,\r\nhaving surprised an enormous fellow taking an afternoon nap on the\r\nsurface of the water, treacherously harpooned him in his sleep, and\r\nthen, steering him as easily as one would drive a well-broken nag,\r\ncompelled him to tow themselves and their pinnace ashore.\r\n\r\nA somewhat startling incident put an end to these interesting\r\nreminiscences.  Johnny was leaning over the gunwale, and with his face\r\nalmost touching the surface, and his hands playing in the water, was\r\npeering down into the lagoon, probably on the look-out for another\r\nturtle, when a large shark, coming as it seemed from beneath the boat,\r\nrose suddenly but quietly, and made a snatch at him.  Johnny saw the\r\nmonster barely in time; for just as he sprang up with a cry of affright,\r\nand fell backwards into the boat the shark's shovel-nose shot four feet\r\nabove water at our stern, his jaws snapping together as he disappeared\r\nagain, with a sound like the springing of a powerful steel-trap.  Though\r\nbaffled in his first attack, the voracious fish continued to follow us,\r\nwatching closely an opportunity for a more successful attempt.  He was a\r\nlarge brown shark, of the species known to sailors as the\r\n\"sea-attorney,\" which designation, together with his formidable\r\nreputation for keenness, vigilance, and enterprise, shows the estimation\r\nin which the members of the ancient and honourable profession of the\r\nlaw, are held by the honest sons of Neptune.  Max professed to recognise\r\nhim, as our acquaintance of the previous evening, by whom himself and\r\nBrowne had been for a time kept in a state of blockade: our present\r\nvisitor certainly evinced the same uncommon fierceness and audacity\r\nwhich had astonished us in the individual referred to.  He was a trim,\r\nround-bodied, compact fellow with a wonderful display of vigour, and\r\neven of grace, in his movements; but though not without a certain kind\r\nof beauty, I do not wish to be understood as saying that his personal\r\nappearance was upon the whole, prepossessing.  On the contrary, his\r\nexpression, if I may venture to use the term, (and he certainly had a\r\ngood deal of expression), was, if not decidedly bad, at the least\r\nexceedingly sinister.  His flattened head, and long leather-like snout\r\ntogether with a pair of projecting goggle eyes, so situated as to\r\ncommand a view both in front and rear, and which he kept turning\r\nrestlessly on every side, contributed greatly to enhance this forbidding\r\naspect.  Every moment he seemed to grow fiercer and bolder, and at\r\nlength he actually laid hold of our keel next the rudder and fairly\r\nshook the boat from stem to stern.  To our great relief, he soon\r\ndesisted from this, for such was his bulk and strength, that we hardly\r\nknew what he might not effect in his furious efforts.  His next move,\r\nwas to make a sudden dash at Max's oar, which had probably given him\r\noffence by coming too near his nose, and which he jerked from his hands.\r\n\r\nMax seemed to regard this last exploit as a personal affront, and loudly\r\ndeclared that, \"this was going altogether too far, and that he should\r\nnot stand it any longer.\"  He accordingly proceeded with great energy,\r\nto lash his cutlass to the handle of one of the remaining oars, with\r\nsome twine which he found in the locker, threatening all sorts of\r\nterrible things against the unsuspecting object of his wrath.  Meanwhile\r\nMorton succeeded in fishing up the lost oar, which the vigilance and\r\nactivity of our attentive escort rendered a somewhat dangerous\r\nundertaking; when recovered, the marks of six rows of formidable teeth\r\nwere found deeply indented upon its blade.\r\n\r\nMax having completed his novel weapon, Browne, who had been engaged in\r\nan unprofitable attempt to strike the shark across the eyes with his\r\ncutlass, inquired, \"what he was going to do with that clumsy\r\ncontrivance!\"\r\n\r\n\"That clumsy contrivance, as you rashly term it,\" replied Max, with\r\ndignity, \"is designed as a shark-exterminator, with which I intend\r\nforthwith to pay my respects to this audacious sea-bully.  We have stood\r\non the defensive quite long enough, and I am now about to carry the war\r\ninto Africa.\"\r\n\r\nHe accordingly jumped upon the middle seat of the yawl, where, in spite\r\nof all attempts at dissuasion, he stood watching a favourable\r\nopportunity for a thrust.  This was soon presented.  All unconscious of\r\nthe unfriendly designs cherished against him, the shark came propelling\r\nhimself carelessly alongside, and directly under Max's nose, with his\r\nback fin quite above water.  The temptation was not to be resisted.  Max\r\nbraced himself as firmly as possible in his position: Arthur\r\nexpostulated, and begged him at least to get down and stand in the boat:\r\nMorton exhorted him to caution.  But he only answered by a wave of the\r\nhand and a grim smile; then requesting Browne to lay fast hold of his\r\nwaist-band, to assist him in preserving the centre of gravity, he raised\r\nhis weapon in both hands, and giving it a preliminary flourish, brought\r\nit down with his full force, aiming at the broadest part of the fish's\r\nback, just forward of the dorsal fin.  But the weapon was too dull, or\r\nthe blow too feeble, to pierce the tough hide of the \"sea-attorney,\" for\r\nit glanced smoothly off and Max losing his balance, went headlong into\r\nthe sea.  Browne, in a hasty effort to save him came near going over\r\nalso, while the boat careened until the water poured in over the\r\ngunwale, and for a moment there was imminent danger of capsizing.  Max\r\ncame to the surface, almost paralysed with fright, and clutched\r\nconvulsively at the side of the boat; when we drew him on board\r\nunharmed, but pale and shivering, as he well might be, after so\r\nextraordinary an escape.  The shark had disappeared, and was now nowhere\r\nto be seen.  Not being accustomed to Max's system of \"carrying the war\r\ninto Africa,\" so sudden and headlong an attack in his own element had\r\nprobably somewhat disconcerted him.  Max made a great effort to assume\r\nan air of composure.  \"Well!\" said he, looking coolly around, \"the enemy\r\nhas, I perceive, beaten a retreat.  I dare say he was quite as much\r\nfrightened as I was, and that is saying a good deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what has become of that patent shark-exterminator!\" observed\r\nBrowne, \"I don't see it anywhere: has the enemy carried it off as a\r\ntrophy of victory, as conquering knights take possession of the arms of\r\ntheir vanquished adversaries!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is much more likely,\" replied Max with disdain, \"that he has carried\r\nit off stuck fast in his carcass.\"\r\n\r\nBut neither supposition proved to be correct, for we presently picked up\r\nthe \"exterminator,\" floating near us.  Johnny narrowly examined the\r\nblade, and was much disappointed at not finding \"any blood on it.\"\r\n\r\nMax now took an oar to steady his nerves by rowing, for, notwithstanding\r\nhis assumed composure and forced pleasantry, they had evidently been a\r\ngood deal shaken by his recent narrow escape.\r\n\r\nBy the time we came in sight of Sea-bird's Point, the increasing light,\r\nand the rosy glow in the \"dappled east,\" heralded the rising of the sun,\r\nand announced that the heat and glare of the tropical day, were on the\r\npoint of succeeding the mild freshness of \"incense-breathing morn.\"  Nor\r\nwere other tokens wanting, that the reign of night was over.  A strange\r\nconfusion of indistinct and broken sounds, issuing from myriads of nests\r\nand perches all along the beach, showed that the various tribes of\r\nsea-fowl were beginning to bestir themselves.  A few slumbrous,\r\nhalf-smothered sounds from scattered nests preluded the general concert,\r\nand then the notes were taken up, and repeated by the entire feathered\r\npopulation for miles along the shore, until the clamour seemed like that\r\nof ten thousand awakening barn-yards.  And now the scene began to be\r\nenlivened by immense multitudes of birds, rising in the air, and\r\nhovering in clouds over the lagoon.  Some wheeled around us in their\r\nspiral flight; others skimmed the water like swallows, dipping with\r\nmarvellous promptness after any ill-starred fish that ventured near the\r\nsurface; others again, rose high into the air, from whence, by their\r\nincredible keenness of sight, they seemed readily to discern their prey,\r\nwhen, poising themselves an instant on expanded wings, they would pounce\r\nperpendicularly downward, and disappearing entirely in the water for an\r\ninstant, emerge, clutching securely a struggling victim.  But in\r\ncarrying on this warfare upon the finny inhabitants of the lagoon the\r\nfeathered spoilers were not perfectly united and harmonious; and fierce\r\ndomestic contentions occasionally interrupted and diversified their\r\nproceedings.  A number of unprincipled man-of-war hawks, who preferred\r\ngaining their livelihood by robbing their neighbours and associates, to\r\nrelying upon their own honest industry, would sail lazily around on\r\nwide-spread pinions, watching with the air of unconcerned spectators the\r\nmethodical toil of the plodding gannets.  But the instant that one of\r\nthe latter rose from a successful plunge, with a plump captive writhing\r\nin his grasp, all appearance of indifference would vanish, and some\r\ndark-plumaged pirate of the lagoon, pouncing down like lightning upon\r\nhis unwarlike neighbour, would ruthlessly despoil him of his hard-earned\r\nprize.  One of these piratical gentry suffered before our eyes a fate\r\nworthy of his rapacity.  A gannet had seized upon a fish much larger\r\nthan his strength enabled him to manage, and was struggling in vain to\r\nlift it into the air, when a hawk darted upon them, and striking his\r\ntalons into the fish, put the gannet to flight.  But the greedy victor\r\nhad greatly miscalculated the strength of his intended prey.  A\r\ndesperate conflict, sometimes under water, and sometimes just at the\r\nsurface, ensued.  The hawk struggled gallantly, but in vain, and was at\r\nlength drawn under by his ponderous antagonist, to rise no more.\r\n\r\nWe landed a short distance beyond Johnny's row of \"Oyster-trees,\" and by\r\nthe time we had climbed the hill, the sun had risen, though not yet\r\nvisible above the wooded heights which sheltered us to the eastward.\r\n\r\nWe were so intent upon our house-building project that, contenting\r\nourselves with a self-denying breakfast of cocoa-nuts, we at once set\r\nzealously to work in carrying it out.\r\n\r\nArthur directed, superintended, and laid out the work in detail.\r\nMorton, having fitted a handle to the hatchet-head, and laboriously\r\nsharpened it upon a rough stone, undertook to supply materials as fast\r\nas called for.  While he cut down trees of the kind and size required by\r\nArthur, Max trimmed off the branches with his cutlass, and prepared them\r\nfor use.  Johnny and Eiulo dragged them to the site of the building,\r\nwhere Browne and I assisted Arthur in setting the posts into the ground,\r\nand putting together the frame of the house.  Of course, our destitution\r\nof proper tools and implements rendered all this exceedingly laborious,\r\nand, but for Arthur's perseverance and ingenuity, we should more than\r\nonce have given up in despair.  Instead of spades, we were obliged to\r\nuse sharp bivalve shells from the shore, in digging places for the\r\nupright posts of the building, and as it was necessary that these should\r\nbe set quite deep, in order to give it firmness and stability, the toil\r\nwas severe.  Max, who came up occasionally to see how the work was\r\nprogressing, and to offer suggestions and criticisms, (more especially\r\nthe latter), on finding us upon our knees, patiently grubbing up the\r\nearth with our shells, flatteringly compared us to so many hedge-hogs\r\nexcavating their burrows.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we persevered; and before night we had nearly completed\r\nthe frame of our building, with the exception of the ridge-pole, the\r\nrafters, and cross-pieces.\r\n\r\nThe posts at the sides stood six feet out of the ground, and were\r\nstationed about three feet apart.  The centre-posts, to support the\r\nridge-pole, were nine feet high, and made from the trunks of well-grown\r\ntrees, some six inches in diameter.  This certainly was a good day's\r\nwork under the circumstances; at any rate, we were quite unanimous in\r\nconsidering it so; and towards twilight we went down to the beach for\r\nour evening bath, in an exceedingly complacent and self-satisfied state\r\nof mind, Max enlarging upon the pleasures of industry, and professing to\r\nbe in the present enjoyment of those feelings--\r\n\r\n  \"Which follow arduous duty well performed.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of repairing to our usual bathing-place, we proceeded along the\r\nbeach to the north-west, until we reached the clump of trees at the edge\r\nof the water, already mentioned as being visible from Castle-hill.  As\r\nwe approached the spot, we found that what had appeared at a distance to\r\nbe but a single group of trees, was, in fact, a small grove extending\r\nalong the shore, and fringing a little cove of nearly elliptical form,\r\nwhich at this point set into the land.  The narrow, shelving beach,\r\nrivalled the whiteness of a fresh snow-drift.  The trees were mostly\r\ncocoa-palms; indeed, scarcely any others could flourish in such a spot;\r\nand there were no shrubs or undergrowth of any kind.  The cove was\r\nperhaps a hundred paces long, and half as wide in the widest part;\r\ncontracting to less than fifty feet where it communicated with the\r\nlagoon.  The water was clear, the bottom smooth and regularly formed,\r\nand the greatest depth was only eight or ten feet.  Max, after viewing\r\nthe cove with the eye of a connoisseur, pronounced it a noble spot for\r\nbathing purposes, and fully equal to the basin on the reef in every\r\nrespect, except in depth and facilities for diving.\r\n\r\nThe impression of his morning's adventure, however, was still fresh, and\r\nhe hinted at the possibility that some shark of elegant tastes, and\r\npossessing an eye for the beautiful, might be in the habit of\r\nfrequenting the cove.  Arthur volunteered to keep watch at the narrow\r\nentrance, while the rest of us were bathing, in order to give timely\r\nnotice of the approach of the dreaded enemy; but on walking out to the\r\nedge of the lagoon we found that this precaution would be unnecessary.\r\nA bar, consisting of a coral patch, very near the surface, stretched\r\nacross the mouth of the cove, rendering it almost impossible for a shark\r\nto enter.\r\n\r\nJohnny named the spot, \"The Mermaid's Cove,\" but this possessive\r\ndesignation was merely complimentary, for so far were we from renouncing\r\nthe cove in favour of the mermaids, that from the day on which we\r\ndiscovered it, it became one of our favourite and regular resorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE CABIN BY THE LAKE.\r\n\r\nA DEMOCRAT IN THE WOODS--ECHO-VALE AND LAKE LAICOMO--THE \"WILD\r\nFRENCHMAN\" DISCOVERED AT LAST.\r\n\r\n  \"A few firm stakes they planted in the ground,\r\n  Circling a narrow space, but large enow,\r\n  These strongly interknit they closed around\r\n  With basket-work of many a pliant bough.\r\n  The roof was like the sides; the door was low,\r\n  And rude the hut, and trimmed with little care,\r\n  For little heart had they to dress it now:\r\n  Yet was the humble structure fresh and fair.\r\n  And soon the inmates found that peace might sojourn there.\"\r\n\r\nIt took us an entire week to complete the frame of our building, and\r\nthis alone involved an amount and variety of labour which few of us had\r\nanticipated when we commenced it.  One day was consumed in selecting,\r\nfelling, and trimming a tree, tall and straight enough to serve as a\r\nridge-pole.  We next had to get out some thirty rafters of hibiscus to\r\nsupport the roof.  Then, as we had no nails, (Max's ship with the\r\nhardware not having yet arrived), we were obliged to adopt the means\r\nused by the Polynesian builders for fastening the rafters to the\r\nridge-pole and cross-pieces, which consists of tying them firmly in\r\ntheir places with sennit.  To supply the place of sennit, we\r\nmanufactured a quantity of cord from twisted hibiscus bark, which\r\nanswered the purpose very well.\r\n\r\nAt length the skeleton of the house was completed.  Twenty-seven strong\r\nposts, (including the three tall centre ones), deeply planted in the\r\nground, supported the string pieces and the ridge-pole.  Fifteen slender\r\nrafters, regularly placed at small intervals, descended from the\r\nridge-pole to the eaves on either side, and the whole was firmly bound\r\ntogether with tough and durable withes of our own manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe thatching occupied another week, and but for Eiulo's skill and\r\ndexterity, we should never have accomplished this nice and difficult\r\noperation, except after a very bungling and imperfect fashion.  Arthur\r\nunderstood very well how it should be done, but his knowledge was\r\ntheoretical rather than practical, while Eiulo had acquired considerable\r\nskill in the art, by building and thatching miniature houses in the\r\nwoods, an amusement which he and his young playmates had often practised\r\nat home.  The only thing now remaining to be done, was to make a number\r\nof coarse mats, with which to enclose the sides of the house--as far as\r\nin such a climate it is desirable to enclose them--together with an\r\nadditional supply, ready to be put up in bad weather, on fastenings\r\nconstructed for the purpose.  But for this, there seemed to be no\r\nimmediate necessity.  The sides of the building were low, and the eaves\r\nextended two feet beyond them, and as we had an excellent roof above us,\r\nwe considered ourselves tolerably prepared, even for rainy weather.\r\nHowever, we commenced manufacturing mats, in which, with the instruction\r\nand example of Arthur and Eiulo, we were tolerably successful; but we\r\nproceeded with this very much at our leisure.  One or two brief showers,\r\nlike that which had exerted so sudden an influence in hastening the\r\ncommencement of our building scheme, afforded us the most satisfactory\r\nevidence of the good qualities of our roof, which did not admit a drop\r\nof rain.  But at the same time we became aware of another defect in our\r\nhouse, as a dwelling in wet weather.  We had no floor but the bare\r\nearth, and though Arthur had so levelled it, and protected it by a\r\nlittle trench and embankment, that no water from the adjacent grounds\r\ncould reach us, except by the gradual process of saturation, still it\r\nwas very damp after a severe rain.  To remedy this, Arthur talked from\r\ntime to time of making a floor of cement, which would dry to the\r\nhardness of stone, and through which the moisture from the ground could\r\nnot penetrate.  When asked where lime was to be obtained with which to\r\nmake his cement he assumed an air of mystery, and merely said that there\r\nwould be no difficulty on that score.  One day, after we had got a large\r\nsupply of mats completed, and ready for use, he again recurred to the\r\nsubject of improving our floor, and explained that he intended to\r\nprepare his mortar or cement, from sand and lime, the latter of which\r\nwas to be procured by burning coral rock in a pit.  He prevailed upon\r\nMorton, Browne, and myself to set about digging a \"lime-pit\" in the\r\ngully beside Castle-hill, while he took Eiulo and Johnny with him in the\r\nboat, to go in search of a quantity of the sponge-shaped coral, which,\r\nhe said, was the best adapted to his purpose.\r\n\r\nMax pronounced the whole project a humbug, and refusing to have anything\r\nto do with it, equipped himself with club and cutlass, and started off\r\non a solitary excursion towards the south-easterly part of the island,\r\nwhich we had not yet explored.  He returned in the afternoon with a\r\nglowing account of the discoveries he had made, among which were a\r\nbeautiful pond of fresh water, a stream flowing into it, and a\r\nwaterfall.\r\n\r\nIn two days we completed a lime-pit of proper dimensions.  Arthur and\r\nhis assistants had in the same time collected and brought to the spot a\r\nsufficient quantity of coral rock; we then covered the bottom of the pit\r\nwith fuel, and laid the coral, previously broken into small pieces, upon\r\nit.  The pile was next kindled, and when the fuel was consumed, we found\r\nthat the coral had yielded a supply of excellent lime, fine and\r\nbeautifully white.  Without going into further details, it is enough to\r\nsay that the rest of Arthur's plan was carried out with the same\r\nsuccess.  The cement was made, and a thick layer of it spread over the\r\nfloor of the house, as evenly and smoothly as could well be done, with\r\nno better trowels than gigantic oyster-shells.  In three days it was\r\nhard as marble, and our house was now as complete as we could make it.\r\nIt had cost us a great deal of severe toil; we had found the\r\nconstruction of it no such holiday employment as we had imagined; but it\r\nwas the fruit of our own ingenuity and perseverance, the work of our own\r\nhands, and we regarded it with much complacency.  Johnny impartially\r\ncompared it with the dwellings of I don't know how many other desert\r\nislanders, and found it superior in some point to each and all of them.\r\n\r\nBeing now in a state of complete preparation, as we flattered ourselves,\r\nfor all sorts of weather, we began to feel as though a regular\r\nout-and-out storm, would be rather a luxury than otherwise.  These\r\nbright skies and sunny days were very well in their way, but it wasn't\r\nin anticipation of them, that we had been planning and working for a\r\nmonth or more.  There was no use at all for our model house in such fine\r\nweather; indeed, while it continued, our old lodgings under the green\r\nforest leaves and the star-light, were far preferable.  It took full\r\nhalf a dozen of our sleeping-mats, (and we had but three apiece), laid\r\nupon the stony floor of our dwelling, to make a couch half as soft as\r\nthose heaps of leaves, which we used to pile up beneath the trees for\r\nour beds, and which we could not now introduce into the house for fear\r\nof \"making a litter.\"  The prudent citizen--who, having at the\r\nthreatened approach of winter laid in a bountiful provision of wood and\r\ncoal, put up his hall-stoves and his double windows, now feels quite\r\nready, in the strength of anthracite and hickory, to snap his fingers in\r\nthe face of Jack Frost, and bid him do his worst--is not more impatient\r\nto have the thermometer fall to the neighbourhood of zero, in order that\r\nhe may realise the comforts he has paid for, than were we for the advent\r\nof such a storm, as would enable us to say to one another, \"Ah! is it\r\nnot fortunate that we have a roof over our heads?  What should we do\r\n_now_, if we had not made timely preparation?\"\r\n\r\nWell, at last we had our wish.  A shower came up one day, in the\r\nafternoon, which did not cease in half an hour, as the previous ones had\r\ndone.  On the contrary, when darkness came on the rain still continued\r\nfalling steadily, with no sign of abatement.  Johnny was in ecstasies.\r\nThis was evidently no night for camping out; it was a night to justify\r\nall our expenditure of labour, in planning and perfecting our dwelling.\r\nWe hung up every extra mat, and fastened them securely with the store of\r\nwooden pegs and pins prepared for that purpose.  To be sure, we were in\r\ncomplete darkness, but then we were perfectly snug and comfortable; and\r\nwhat a luxury, to lie sheltered from the storm, and listen to the\r\npattering of the rain upon the root and the dismal sound of the water\r\ndripping from the eaves!\r\n\r\nThe second morning after this rain-storm, which had so pleasantly tested\r\nthe qualities of our dwelling, we started, under Max's guidance, to make\r\nan excursion to that part of the island, to the south-east of\r\nCastle-hill, of which he had given so glowing an account.  After half an\r\nhour's toilsome march over uneven ground, we entered a grove, which, to\r\nJohnny's great exultation, was composed almost entirely of bread-fruit\r\ntrees.  They grew with much regularity, at almost equal distances, so as\r\nto form broad straight avenues, overarched by a canopy of spreading\r\nbranches and dark glossy leaves.  Vistas of shapely diamond-chequered\r\ntrunks stretched away in every direction, in long and shady perspective.\r\nAmong the dense masses of foliage, hung a profusion of large globes, of\r\na light-delicate green, or a golden yellow, the splendid fruit of this\r\nnoblest and most stately tree of the tropics.  The ripe and the unripe\r\nfruit hung side by side from the same branches, and Johnny could hardly\r\nbe persuaded to postpone gathering a supply of it until our return.  Our\r\ncourse had been upon the whole rather an ascending one, so that this\r\ngrove must have occupied an elevated situation.  The ground over which\r\nit extended was nearly level, with slight wave-like undulations.  As we\r\napproached its eastern limit, Max told us to prepare ourselves for the\r\nmost charming spectacle that we had ever beheld.  He walked on before\r\nwith the air of a cicerone when about to exhibit a _chef d'oeuvre_, and\r\nstood waiting and beckoning for us at the border of the grove.  On\r\njoining him we found that he had scarcely exaggerated in his\r\ndescriptions of the spot.\r\n\r\nWe stood at the top of a smooth and gradual descent.  Before us lay a\r\nsecluded valley, from which the land rose on every side, to about the\r\nelevation of the grove behind us.  In some places it ascended in gentle\r\nslopes, in others by abrupt acclivities.  In the bosom of the valley\r\nspread a little lake of oval form, fringed in some places with\r\nshrubbery, while in others, groups of casuarinas extended their long\r\ndrooping boughs in graceful arches over the water.  After pausing a\r\nmoment we descended to the margin of the pond, which was so limpid that\r\nwe could distinguish every pebble at the bottom.  At the upper or\r\nnorthern end, and near the point at which we had come out of the grove,\r\na small stream precipitated itself some fifteen feet down a rocky\r\ndeclivity, and fell into a circular basin a few yards in diameter.\r\nOverflowing this basin, it found its way into the lake by another\r\ndescent of a few feet.  Around the basin, and on both sides of the\r\nwaterfall, were several curious columns of basalt, and irregular\r\npicturesque piles of basaltic rock.  The plash of the water, falling\r\ninto the rocky basin, was the only sound that broke the Sabbath-like\r\nsilence that pervaded the valley.  There was, or seemed to be, something\r\nunreal and dream-like about the scene, that made us pause where we\r\nstood, in silence, as though the whole were an illusion, which a word or\r\na motion would dispel.\r\n\r\n\"How beautiful!\" exclaimed Browne, at last, and a soft clear echo, like\r\nthe voice of the tutelary spirit of the valley, answered, \"Beautiful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\" cried Johnny, \"what a charming echo.  Listen again,\" and he\r\nshouted \"Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" softly responded the echo, and almost in the same breath a\r\nharsh voice, apparently close at hand, and which was evidently not an\r\necho, cried out, \"Hillioh--oh!\"\r\n\r\nWe started, and gazed around us, and at each other, in astonishment, but\r\nwe could see nothing from which this strange exclamation could proceed.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Johnny, in a trembling whisper, and seizing Browne's hand,\r\n\"that is the voice of the wild Frenchman I heard in the woods near\r\nCastle-hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Max, gravely, \"who knows but there are cannibals here?\r\nYou had better be careful, Johnny, how you hurrah in the woods.\"  Max's\r\nmanner made me suspect that he possessed some clue to the mystery which\r\nthe rest of us lacked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" answered Johnny, stoutly, while the apprehensive glances\r\nwhich he cast around on every side, hardly agreed with his valiant\r\nwords, \"I shall hurrah in spite of all the savages on the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hillioh!--Hillioh!\" yelled the same voice, more fiercely than before.\r\n\r\nMax burst into a fit of laughter, when following the direction of his\r\neye, we looked up, and espied an enormous parrot perched upon a purau\r\nbranch, directly over our heads, from which he eyed us with a disdainful\r\nand truculent air.\r\n\r\n\"There's your wild Frenchman at last, Johnny,\" said Max, \"I expect he'll\r\ncall us to account presently for our treatment of his hat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't give up de sheep!\" screamed the parrot.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Max, \"what's the use of trying to talk English: it's quite\r\nplain you're a Parly-vous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vive l'empereur!\" shrieked the parrot.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you can give us a song, monsieur,\" pursued Max; \"favour us\r\nwith `Polly put the kettle on,' s'il vous plait.\"\r\n\r\nThe bird twisted his head round, as though giving earnest attention to\r\nwhat was said; then, after a moment, which from his wise look seemed to\r\nbe occupied in profoundly considering the reasonableness of the request,\r\nhe burst forth with--\r\n\r\n  \"Allons enfants de la Patrie\r\n  Le jour de gloire est arrivee!\"\r\n\r\nShrieking out the two lines as though they composed a single word.\r\nApparently satisfied with this display of his accomplishments, he spread\r\nhis wings, and flew heavily across the lake, alighting not far from the\r\nshore, whence we could hear him occasionally uttering a shrill cry.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see where the parrot is now?\" inquired Morton of me, a moment\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see his green feathers among the foliage, but not very\r\ndistinctly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless I am much mistaken,\" pursued he, \"there is a shed or building of\r\nsome kind among the trees, on the other side of the lake, where he has\r\nalighted.\"\r\n\r\nOn shifting our ground a little, we could all perceive between the\r\nboughs of the trees, something, that did in fact look like a low wooden\r\nbuilding, and after a moment's consultation, it was agreed that Morton\r\nand Max should cross the stream, (which could easily be done where it\r\npoured into the lake), and reconnoitre, while the rest awaited their\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nBy leaping from stone to stone, and wading occasionally for short\r\ndistances, they picked their way to the other side, and presently\r\ndisappeared among the casuarinas.  After about fifteen minutes they\r\nreturned to the shore, and called for us to come over, saying that they\r\nhad discovered a building, which appeared, however, to have been long\r\ndeserted.  Browne took Johnny upon his back, and we forded the rapids as\r\nthe others had done.\r\n\r\nFollowing Max and Morton, we soon reached a kind of landing-place,\r\nhalf-way between the lake and the top of the ascent, in the centre of\r\nwhich was a low wooden building, surrounded by a rude fence of pointed\r\nstakes.  Entering through a gate, hung upon leather hinges, we found\r\nourselves in front of the hut.  It appeared to be built of timber which\r\nhad once composed part of a ship, and was put together with considerable\r\nskill.  The yard was full of rank weeds, and damp masses of lichen and\r\nmoss hung from the eaves of the house, and covered its roof.  The door,\r\nwhich was furnished with a lock and brass-handle, was closed, but not\r\nfastened; we opened it, and entered a large square-room, lighted by four\r\nwindows, two of which had evidently been taken from the stern of a\r\nvessel; the remaining two seemed to have once constituted the upper\r\nparts of sash-doors.  These windows were well put into the sides of the\r\nhouse, and from the appearance of all the work about the room, I\r\ninferred that it had been done by persons accustomed to that kind of\r\nlabour.  A pine-table, which had lost half of one leg, and two chairs\r\nwithout backs, composed the entire furniture of this apartment.  A rude\r\nshelf was fastened against the wall between two of the windows, upon\r\nwhich a number of earthen-ware dishes were arranged.  A smaller\r\napartment was partitioned off with rough boards from the first, with\r\nwhich it communicated by a simple opening or doorway, without any door.\r\n\r\nIn this second room were several low wooden frames, probably designed as\r\nbedsteads, ranged side by side, and a large chest stained or painted\r\nblue.  In one corner stood a small square writing-table, of some\r\ndark-coloured wood, with several drawers.  In another corner, Max\r\ndiscovered a rusty gridiron and sauce-pan, a small iron pot and a\r\ntoasting-fork, upon which he pounced with the eagerness of a miser\r\nlighting upon hidden treasures.  The chest was empty, but a small box,\r\nor till, fixed in one end of it, contained a number of vials, a\r\ncork-screw, a tin-canister, and a French Bible, upon the last of which\r\nArthur seized with as much avidity as Max had evinced in appropriating\r\nthe cooking utensils.  Johnny pulled open the drawers of the little\r\nwriting-table, and found a bunch of quills, a spool of green ribbon, a\r\nfile of invoices and bills of lading, a bottle of ink, and about half a\r\nream of letter-paper, which he declared was just what was wanted for the\r\npurpose of writing \"our story.\"\r\n\r\nThe place had a gloomy and deserted air, and we unanimously agreed that\r\nneither the dwelling nor its location was nearly as pleasant as our own\r\nat Castle-hill.\r\n\r\nThere were several articles which we wished to carry away with us, but\r\nwe concluded to postpone this until a future visit.  Max, however,\r\nhaving once laid hold of the gridiron, seemed extremely loath to part\r\nwith it again, and, finally yielding to the irresistible fascination\r\nwhich it evidently had for him, he threw it over his shoulder as we\r\nstarted on our return, and brought it away with him.  Having been\r\nfastidiously purified by repeated scourings and ablutions, it proved\r\nvery useful in preparing our meals, of which fresh fish frequently\r\nformed the principal part.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, as we sat at the terraced top of Castle-hill, Johnny\r\ntook seriously in hand the important business of finding appropriate\r\nnames for the discoveries of the day.\r\n\r\nThe valley beyond the grove of bread-fruit, he concluded to call \"Echo\r\nVale.\"  For the lake itself, quite a variety of names was suggested,\r\nnone of which, however, seemed to be entirely satisfactory.  After\r\npuzzling over the subject a long while without any result, and working\r\nhimself into quite a nervous and excited state, a happy thought seemed\r\nall at once to suggest itself and turning to Arthur, he eagerly demanded\r\nwhat was \"the most beautiful lake in all the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Loch Katrine, to be sure!\" said Browne; \"some would say Loch Lomond,\r\nbut that is the second.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lake George!\" cried Max, decisively.\r\n\r\n\"Lake Como, in Switzerland, is said to be, by the tourists and the\r\npoets,\" answered Arthur, to whom the question had been more particularly\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\nThe last name seemed to please Johnny exceedingly, and after repeating\r\nit several times with approbation, he inquired of Arthur, \"What it was\r\nthat Olla, in the Cannibal story, called her pet wood-pigeon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lai-evi,\" answered Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"And you said that meant Little Captive,\" pursued Johnny with great\r\nanimation, \"and the `Lai' means `little,' I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, `Lai' is the diminutive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I have it at last!  Our lake, though so small, is--\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite a Como for its size,\" interrupted Max, \"and _so_ it shall be\r\ncalled--\"\r\n\r\n\"Lake Laicomo!\" cried Johnny, exultingly.\r\n\r\nI am thus particular in mentioning these names, chiefly for the benefit\r\nof all persons engaged in the preparation of new editions of the school\r\ngeographies and atlases; and I take this opportunity, at Johnny's\r\nespecial request, to call their attention to the matter, in order that\r\nour island and its geographical dimensions may be accurately laid down\r\nand described in future works of the kind referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE REMOVAL.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE RAINY SEASON--GOING INTO WINTER-QUARTERS--\"MONSIEUR\r\nPAUL\"--THE PATRIARCH OF THE LAKE.\r\n\r\n  \"Now Winter comes to rule the varied year,\r\n  Sullen and sad, with all his gloomy train\r\n  Of vapours, clouds, and storms.\"\r\n\r\nWe had now been several months upon the island, and notwithstanding our\r\nconstant watchfulness, we had not, during all this time, seen a single\r\nsail.  Of the vast multitudes of vessels that track the ocean in every\r\ndirection, not one had visited the solitary sea that lay within the\r\nboundaries of our horizon; or if any had crossed the verge of the wide\r\ncircle, her coming and departure had been alike unobserved by us.\r\n\r\nAnd now, by a variety of indications, it was manifest that the winter of\r\nthe tropical year was at hand.  The steady easterly breezes, which, with\r\noccasional variations of south-easterly, had hitherto prevailed, were\r\nsucceeded by violent and fickle winds, blowing sometimes from a dozen\r\ndifferent and opposite points of the compass in the course of\r\ntwenty-four hours.  The brief and sudden showers which we had had at\r\nintervals for some time past gradually became more heavy and frequent.\r\nAt length, one calm, sultry day, about noon, a storm, accompanied by\r\nthunder and lightning came up, with so little previous notice, that\r\nalthough Arthur and myself were at the time scarcely two hundred yards\r\nfrom the house, we were thoroughly drenched before we could reach it.\r\nAnd this proved to be no mere thunder shower, such as we had already\r\nbeen two or three times surprised by.  Scarcely had we got under\r\nshelter, when the air grew so dark that it would really have been\r\ndifficult to see one's way through the grove.  I had never before\r\nwitnessed any thing like this, and I began to fear that we were going to\r\nbe visited by one of those terrible hurricanes which sometimes devastate\r\ntropical countries.  The wind soon commenced blowing with such violence,\r\nthat the largest and sturdiest of the old trees that surrounded our\r\nhouse, bent and swayed before its fury.  Their tops lashed each other\r\noverhead, and filled the air with clouds of leaves, whirled away upon\r\nthe tempest.  Large boughs were twisted off like twigs, and strewed the\r\nground in every direction.  The creaking and groaning of the trees; the\r\nloud flapping of the palm-leaves, like that of a sail loose in the wind;\r\nthe howling and shrieking of the gale, as it burst in quick, fierce\r\ngusts through the forest; with the almost total darkness that enveloped\r\nus, were truly appalling.\r\n\r\nThe strength of our dwelling was now put to a severer test than its\r\nbuilders had ever anticipated, and it yielded to the force of the wind,\r\nso that at times the side-posts stood at an angle of forty-five degrees\r\nwith the floor; had they been of any material less tough and pliant than\r\nthe hibiscus, they must have snapped off in an instant.  It was well,\r\ntoo, that they had been deeply and firmly planted in the ground, or the\r\nwhole fabric would have been lifted bodily into the air, and swept away\r\nlike a withered leaf.  As it was, though wrenched and twisted woefully,\r\nit stood firm.  The thatch, of which Arthur was so proud, and which had\r\nhitherto been storm-proof, now opened in many places, and a dozen little\r\nstreams began to pour in upon us.\r\n\r\nBefore night, the sound of running waters without was like that of a\r\ngreat spring freshet.  Cataracts were leaping on every side from the\r\nedges of the height, and a raging and turbid torrent filled the gully\r\nthat separated the forest from Castle-hill.\r\n\r\nThe tempest continued for nearly forty-eight hours.  By the time it was\r\nover, we had quite come to the conclusion, that if this was to be\r\nregarded as a foretaste and specimen, of what we had to expect during\r\nthe rainy season, it would never do to think of remaining in our present\r\nhabitation.  Considering this as a timely warning, we resolved, after a\r\nformal consultation, to put the deserted cabin by the lake, forthwith\r\ninto tenantable condition, so as to be ready to take up our\r\nwinter-quarters there, if we should find it expedient to do so.\r\n\r\nOn the first fine day, we commenced carrying this resolution into\r\neffect, knowing that we had now but little time to lose.  The cabin had\r\noriginally been built substantially, and with a good deal of skill, and\r\nit had suffered but little from decay.  We had, in fact nothing to do in\r\nthe way of repairing it, except to rehang the door, which was loose, and\r\npartially unhinged, and to mend the roof, which leaked in one or two\r\nplaces.  We then cleared the yard from the rank weeds by which it was\r\novergrown, aired the house thoroughly, by setting door and windows open\r\nfor a day or two, and swept out both apartments with cocoa-nut brooms.\r\n\r\nWe next, under Arthur's direction, commenced laying in a stock of\r\nprovisions.  Abundance of ripe bread-fruit could now be procured.  We\r\ngathered a considerable quantity, which Arthur and Eiulo baked and\r\npounded, and prepared, by burying it under ground, wrapped in leaves, in\r\nsuch a manner that it would keep, as they said, for several months.  We\r\nalso piled up in one corner of the small room, a great heap of\r\ncocoa-nuts, with the husks on, in which way they can be preserved fresh\r\na long while.  A bushel of candle-nuts, and about the same quantity of\r\ntaro and patara roots, completed our winter supplies.\r\n\r\nJohnny was much dissatisfied with the poverty of these preparations for\r\nthe rainy season.  He thought we ought to have laid in a large stock of\r\nsalted or smoked fish, besides catching a score or two of turtle, and\r\ndepositing them safely upon their backs in some convenient place, ready\r\nto be converted into soup, at any moment by the magic of Max's culinary\r\nart.\r\n\r\nArthur thought that we need not anticipate a season of continuous storms\r\nor steady rains--that though the prevailing weather for some months\r\nwould be tempestuous, there would nevertheless be some fine days in\r\nnearly every week, during which we could venture forth.\r\n\r\nAnother storm, as violent as the last, fully decided us to make the\r\ncontemplated removal to the cabin, and that without further delay.\r\nJohnny transported thither his entire collection of shells, corals,\r\netcetera, which had now grown to be quite extensive.  Arthur carried\r\nover an armful of specimens of plants and flowers, which had long been\r\naccumulating for an \"herbarium.\"  Max, however, averred that they were a\r\npart of the materials for a treatise on \"The Botany of Polynesia,\" which\r\nArthur cherished the ambitious design of composing, and which was to be\r\npublished with coloured plate, simultaneously with the history of our\r\nadventures.  In order that he too might have some indoor occupation\r\nduring the anticipated bad weather, Max provided himself with a huge\r\nlog, hacked and sawed with great labour, from a bread-fruit tree, blown\r\ndown in the last gale, out of which he declared it to be his purpose to\r\nbuild a miniature ship, destined to convey the aforesaid history,\r\ntogether with Arthur's botanical treatise, to America.\r\n\r\nThe day fixed for our final migration to \"Lake Laicomo,\" at length\r\narrived, and taking a farewell for \"the season,\" of our deserted\r\ntenement at Castle-hill, we set out for the cabin, to spend our first\r\nnight there.  It was not without some feelings of regret that we left a\r\nspot now become so familiar, to bury ourselves in the woods out of sight\r\nof the sea.  It seemed almost like going again into exile.  Johnny, in\r\nparticular, felt greatly humiliated, at being obliged to abandon the\r\nhouse which had cost us so much toil, to take refuge in one constructed\r\nby others.  He seemed to look upon this as a kind of tacit admission of\r\nour own utter incapacity to provide for ourselves in that respect.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the cabin, we were somewhat surprised to see our\r\ndemocratic friend the parrot, perched over the door, as if waiting to\r\nwelcome us to our new quarters.  He appeared to be in no degree\r\ndisturbed at our approach, but greeting us with one or two boisterous\r\n\"Vive Napoleons!\" maintained his position until we had passed into the\r\nhouse, when he flew in also, and alighting on the shelf against the\r\nwall, seemed to feel as much at home as any one.  Johnny sagely\r\nsuggested that he knew that the rainy season was coming on, and was\r\nanxious to establish himself in comfortable quarters until it was over:\r\npossibly this supposition did our visitor injustice, by ascribing to him\r\nmotives more selfish and interested, than those by which he was really\r\nactuated.  It is more charitable to believe, that having been once\r\naccustomed to human companionship, and being weary of his solitary life\r\nin the woods, where his vocal accomplishments were wasted on the desert\r\nair, he now sought our society, as being more congenial to his tastes\r\nand education, than that of the feathered denizens of the forest.  Be\r\nthis however as it may, \"Monsieur Paul,\" (as he called himself), from\r\nthat time took up his abode with us, and though he would sometimes\r\ndisappear for days together, he was sure to come back at last, when, if\r\nhe found the door and windows closed, (as sometimes happened), he would\r\nscream, and hurrah for \"Sheneral Shackson,\" until he gained admittance.\r\nOne circumstance, which I am sorry to say throws some shade of suspicion\r\nupon the pure disinterestedness of his motives, is, that he generally\r\nwent off at the commencement of fine weather, and returned a little\r\nbefore a storm.  This was so uniformly the case, that Max used to\r\nprophesy the character of the weather by his movements, and often, when\r\nto our eyes there was not the slightest indication of a change, he would\r\nsay--\"There comes Monsieur--look-out for a storm presently\"--and it was\r\nrarely that he proved mistaken in such predictions.\r\n\r\nThe second day after our removal, there was a gale, in which great trees\r\nwere blown down or torn up by the roots.  Though shaken by the force of\r\nthe wind, the cabin was too firmly built to permit any apprehension of\r\nits being overthrown; and there were no trees of large size near it, by\r\nthe fall of which it could be endangered: but we should scarcely have\r\nfelt safe in our former dwelling.\r\n\r\nWe now improved every pleasant day to the utmost, in completing our\r\npreparations for the period of heavy rains, which Arthur declared to be\r\nclose at hand.  Browne and Morton made a fish-pond by building a dam of\r\nloose stones across the rapids below the fall, just where the stream\r\nentered the lake.  It was soon well-stocked, without any trouble on our\r\npart, with fish resembling roach and perch, numbers of which were\r\ncarried over the fall, and prevented by the dam from escaping into the\r\nlake.  We also collected a large quantity of bread-fruit bark, and of\r\nthe fibrous netting which binds the stalk of the cocoa-nut leaf to the\r\ntrunk, to be worked up in various ways.  This singular fabric, which in\r\ntexture somewhat resembles coarse cotton cloth, is often obtained from\r\nthe larger trees in strips two or three feet wide.  It is strong and\r\ndurable, and is used by the natives for making bags, and for other\r\nsimilar purposes.  Garments too, are sometimes made from it, though for\r\nthat purpose tappa is preferred.  While the leaves are young and tender,\r\nthis remarkable substance is white and transparent, quite flexible, and\r\naltogether a delicate and beautiful fabric, but not sufficiently strong\r\nto be put to any useful purpose: as it becomes older and tougher, it\r\nassumes a yellow colour, and loses much of its flexibility and beauty.\r\nA quantity of hibiscus bark was also collected, to be used in the\r\nmanufacture of cord for fishing-lines, nets, etcetera.\r\n\r\nWhile the rest of us were actively engaged, under Arthur's direction, in\r\naccumulating a stock of these materials, Max devoted all his energies to\r\nthe task of capturing an enormous eel which frequented the upper end of\r\nthe lake.  But he exhausted all his ingenuity in this endeavour without\r\nsuccess.  The monster had a secure retreat among the submerged roots of\r\nan old buttress tree, beneath an overhanging bank, from which Max daily\r\nlured him forth by throwing crumbs into the water; but, after devouring\r\nthe food that was thrown to him, he would immediately return to his\r\nstronghold under the bank.  Max was at great pains to manufacture a\r\nfish-hook out of a part of a cork-screw found in the till of the blue\r\nchest, by means of which he confidently expected to bring matters to a\r\nspeedy and satisfactory issue between himself and his wary antagonist.\r\nBut the latter would not touch the bait that concealed the hook.  Driven\r\nto desperation by this unexpected discomfiture, Max next made sundry\r\nattempts to spear and \"harpoon\" him, all of which signally failed, so\r\nthat at the end of the brief interval of fine weather, this patriarch of\r\nthe lake, whose wisdom seemed to be proportioned to his venerable age\r\nand gigantic size, remained proof against all the arts and machinations\r\nof his chagrined and exasperated enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nWINTER EVENINGS AT HOME.\r\n\r\nAMUSEMENTS AND OCCUPATIONS--STORY-TELLING--THE SOUTH-SEA LYCEUM.\r\n\r\n  \"When the winter nights grow long,\r\n  And the winds without blow cold,\r\n  We sit in a ring round the warm wood fire,\r\n  And listen to stories old.\"\r\n\r\nHaving now brought my story down to the period of our getting into\r\nwinter-quarters at Lake Laicomo, (where, during the last few weeks, the\r\nforegoing portion of this narrative has been written), I shall change my\r\ntenses, for the present chapter at least, while I sketch the occupations\r\nand amusements by which we endeavour to fill up the time of our\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season is now nearly over, and we have got through it much\r\nmore comfortably and pleasantly than we anticipated.  The few fine days\r\nduring which we finished our preparations for it, as mentioned in the\r\nlast chapter, were succeeded, in accordance with Arthur's prediction, by\r\nmore than a week of steady rain, and for several weeks there was not a\r\nday without rain.  During this time, of course, we were thrown entirely\r\nupon our indoor resources, and, thanks to the forethought which had\r\nprovided an abundant store of materials, upon which the ingenuity or\r\nindustry of each of us could be variously exercised, we have thus far\r\nmanaged to keep pretty busy.\r\n\r\nWe have twisted a great store of cord for fishing-lines, nets, and other\r\npurposes, from the supply of hibiscus bark previously laid in.  We have\r\nalso manufactured more than a dozen pairs of serviceable moccasins, with\r\nno other materials than cocoa-nut cotton and bread-fruit bark.  Browne\r\nhas made a chess-board, and rudely but elaborately carved a complete set\r\nof men, of gigantic size, in which he has evinced much skill and\r\ningenuity, and a vast deal of perseverance.  The castles are mounted\r\nupon the backs of elephants, which Johnny innocently mistook for\r\nenormous swine with two tails apiece.  The knights are provided with\r\nshields, bearing Saint Andrew's cross and the thistle for a device, and\r\nwould have been arrayed, without doubt, in kilt and tartan had it been\r\npossible.  The bishops wear grotesque-looking cocked hats, intended for\r\nmitres, and their countenances are so singularly truculent and\r\nunprepossessing, that Max accuses the artist of having in this petty\r\nway, evinced \"his Scottish and Presbyterian spite against Episcopacy.\"\r\n\r\nMorton has, among other things, made a couple of nets, and a mortar and\r\npestle for pounding bread-fruit and taro.\r\n\r\nMax's time and attention have been chiefly devoted to the manufacture of\r\na variety of warlike weapons, among which are four or five formidable\r\nbludgeons, which he styles \"Feejee war-clubs,\" made from the hard and\r\nponderous wood of the casuarina.  He has also worked a good deal, at\r\nintervals, upon the huge log, out of which the \"Messenger ship\" is to be\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nArthur has been more usefully employed in contriving two frames or\r\nstands, designed as candlesticks for holding the native substitute for\r\ncandles, which substitute consists simply of a cocoa-nut stalk, some\r\neighteen inches long, strung with candle-nuts.  These nuts are of about\r\nthe size of a horse-chestnut, and contain a considerable quantity of\r\noil: they are the fruit of one of the largest and most magnificent trees\r\nof our island.  One nut will burn from five to ten minutes, according to\r\nits size, and if they are pressed closely together upon the stalk, the\r\nflame communicates readily from one to another, affording a tolerably\r\nclear and steady light until the entire string is consumed.\r\n\r\nTo supply the place of Johnny's jacket and trousers, which are\r\ncompletely worn out, Arthur has made, from two or three large strips of\r\ncocoa-nut cotton, a garment resembling the South American \"poncho,\"\r\nbeing a loose wrapper, with a circular aperture through which the head\r\nof the wearer is to be thrust.  It is by no means an elegant article of\r\napparel, and Johnny was at first inclined to look upon it with\r\ndisfavour.  But upon being informed that it was in all respects, except\r\nthe material of which it was made, like the \"tiputa,\" formerly worn by\r\nthe Tahitian chiefs and men of note, he became fully reconciled to it.\r\n\r\nThese, (which I mention merely as a sample of our industrial labours),\r\nand similar tasks, furnish us occupation during the day.  As soon as it\r\ngets dark, we set out the broken-legged table in the middle of the room,\r\nand lighting three or four skewers of candle-nuts, amuse or employ\r\nourselves in a variety of ways.  Browne and Morton frequently sit down\r\nto a game of chess, or seizing a couple of Max's \"Feejee war-clubs,\"\r\npractise the broad-sword exercise, in which Browne, who has some skill\r\nin fencing, occasionally gives lessons to the rest.\r\n\r\nArthur has opened an evening-school, in which he teaches Eiulo reading\r\nand writing, and gives Johnny instruction in botany and conchology,\r\nusing his \"herbarium,\" and Johnny's collection of shells, for the\r\npurpose of illustration.  He also writes a good deal, and asks Eiulo\r\nmany questions respecting the customs, ceremonies, and traditions of\r\nTewa.  Occasionally, during such conversations, when he makes a note of\r\nsomething new or striking, Max laughs, and says, that in addition to the\r\ngreat work on the botany of Polynesia, Arthur designs to enlighten the\r\nworld with a learned treatise on the \"Traditions and Superstitions of\r\nthe South-Sea Islanders.\"\r\n\r\nJohnny either re-arranges his \"collection,\" or plays jack straws with\r\nEiulo, or devotes himself to the education of the parrot.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I have hitherto amused myself during the evenings in writing\r\nup \"the narrative,\" and occasionally reading portions of it aloud,\r\nclaiming, however, the privilege of skipping such passages as I think\r\nproper.  It having been solemnly resolved that the \"history of our\r\nadventures\" must be written in the form of a \"regular desert island\r\nstory,\" to use Johnny's expression, and divided into chapters, Max\r\ninsists that the commencement of each chapter should be furnished with a\r\npoetical motto, and offers, in the capacity of a dictionary of\r\nquotations, to furnish scraps of rhyme for that purpose, to order, in\r\nany quantity required, and at the shortest notice, upon merely being\r\ninformed of the sentiment with which the motto is desired to harmonise.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing the narrative thus far, with the exception of such\r\nportions as I have thought proper to omit, Max expresses strong distrust\r\nof my fairness and impartiality as a historian.  He accuses me in\r\nparticular, of having done him injustice by omitting some of his most\r\nremarkable exploits, as well as many brilliant sayings upon a great\r\nvariety of subjects.  He declares that I do not understand and\r\nappreciate him--that I am incapable of doing so; and that I have\r\nunjustly, though perhaps unintentionally, represented him as a trifling,\r\nlight-minded sort of person.  I have, therefore, felt bound to record\r\nthis protest of the injured party, but having just read it to him, he\r\npronounces it unsatisfactory, and an aggravation of the original wrong.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as a variation of our evening amusements, we put out the\r\nlights, and sit and tell stories in the dark.  Browne's memory is stored\r\nwith an unfailing supply of marvellous tales and legends, founded upon\r\nScottish history and tradition, or the habits and superstitions of the\r\npeople; some relate to wraiths, warnings, second sight, etcetera; some\r\nillustrate the prowess of Scottish heroes and worthies, from Bruce and\r\nWallace, right down to Johnny Armstrong and Rob Roy Macgregor; others,\r\nagain, are wild and tragical tales of covenanting times, or of the\r\nsufferings endured, and the dangers encountered by his countrymen, for\r\ntheir religious faith, from the time of the murder of \"holy Patrick\r\nHamilton, the first Scottish martyr,\" to the forays of prelatical\r\nmoss-troopers, and the butcheries of Claverhouse, in later days.\r\n\r\nThe chief point of all Browne's narratives, however various their\r\nsubjects, is to illustrate the superiority of Scotland, and every thing\r\nScottish, from martyrs to mendicants, and from heroes to highwaymen,\r\nover all the rest of the world in general, and the sister kingdom in\r\nparticular.  I was greatly amused by one of his stories, which related\r\nhow a Scottish border-robber outwitted and plundered an English\r\nprofessional brother.  In his patriotic resolution to uphold the\r\nsuperiority of his country in all respects, Browne was not even willing\r\nto allow that the pilferers and marauders south of the Tweed, could at\r\nall compare in address and audacity, with those who enjoyed the\r\nadvantage of having been bred to the north of it.\r\n\r\nMax, too, was, (at least in Johnny's estimation), a famous story-teller,\r\nalmost equal in fact to Schehezerade, of the Thousand and One Nights.\r\nHis stories, however, were of an entirely different character from those\r\nof Browne.  They had no savour of historic or traditionary truth,--no\r\nrelation to actual life,--and in this consisted their great charm.\r\nTheir subject matter, was the wonderful exploits of bold knights-errant,\r\nsallying forth, attended by their trusty esquires, in search of high\r\nadventures; their chivalrous encounters with other knights in mortal\r\nquarrel, or for the honours of the tourney; their incredible feats of\r\nstrength and valour in the rescue of captive maidens, wandering\r\nprincesses, and distressed damsels, from all sorts of unheard-of perils,\r\nand in the redress of all manner of grievances, by whomsoever suffered.\r\nIn his more romantic flights he described exploits yet more perilous\r\nthan these,--conflicts with giants and ogres,--the storming and\r\ndemolishing of enchanted castles, defended by scaly griffins, and\r\nfire-breathing dragons, backed by the potent spells and incantations of\r\nsome hostile magician.  To such narratives Johnny would willingly listen\r\nby the hour.  Any trifling anachronisms or inconsistencies, which\r\nsometimes occurred, never troubled him in the least.  If some of Max's\r\nknights, equipped with sword and shield, and sheathed in mail, were also\r\nexpert at fire-arms, and handled a rifle or a revolver, like a\r\nKentuckian, Johnny respected and admired them all the more on account of\r\nthese varied accomplishments, and never troubled the narrator with any\r\nvexatious demand for explanations.\r\n\r\nAt first Max had been greatly piqued at the slight interest which Johnny\r\nseemed to feel in the fate of his heroes.  The fact was, that he had\r\nbecome so familiar with that department of literature, and was so\r\naccustomed to see the hero come safely out of the most horrible and\r\nunheard-of dangers, that he regarded it as quite a matter of course, and\r\nthere was now no such thing as alarming him for his safety.  It was to\r\nno purpose that Max surrounded his heroes with fierce and numerous foes;\r\nJohnny took it quite coolly, expecting him to cut his way out as a hero\r\nshould.  It was in vain to cover him with wounds--a hero's wounds are\r\nnever mortal.  Cast him away upon an iron-bound coast in the midst of a\r\nhurricane--Johnny knew that _one_ would escape: drown a hero! who ever\r\nheard of such a thing!  Max at length resented this indifference, by\r\nsuddenly becoming quite tragical, and actually despatching two or three\r\nheroes with very little ceremony.  The first of these unfortunate\r\ngentlemen perished, if I remember correctly, by \"a tremendous backstroke\r\nof a two-handed, double-edged sword, that severed his head from his\r\nbody.\"  At this sentence, which seemed pretty decisive, Johnny was\r\nsomewhat staggered, but, immediately recovering himself, he bade Max \"go\r\non,\" expecting, I verily believe, that it would turn out that the head\r\nwas not in fact _quite_ cut off or that if it was, it would, like that\r\nof the physician Dubin, in the Arabian Nights, be again set upon the\r\nshoulders, and life restored by the healing virtue of some potent\r\nmedicament.  Great was his astonishment and consternation, on being made\r\nat last to comprehend, that the hero was actually dead; which fact he\r\ndid not, however, appear fully to realise, until Max, to put the matter\r\nbeyond doubt, buried him with great funereal pomp and ceremony, and\r\nerected over his remains a splendid monument, with an inscription\r\nrecording his exploits and his valour.  This method of proceeding, Max\r\njudiciously followed up, by giving a tragical termination to his\r\nromances, often enough to keep Johnny reminded that _his_ heroes at any\r\nrate were mortal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these resources for our evenings, we have the semi-weekly\r\nmeetings of \"The South-Sea Lyceum,\" which was organised soon after the\r\ncommencement of the rainy season, and of which Arthur is the president\r\nhaving been twice unanimously elected to that dignified and responsible\r\noffice.  Recitations or declamations, essays, and debates upon questions\r\npreviously selected, constitute the regular exercises at these meetings.\r\nBrowne possesses quite a talent for dramatic recitation, and he has\r\nShakespeare almost by heart, which circumstances, early on the voyage\r\nout, earned for him the nickname of \"Shaks.\"  At nearly every session of\r\nthe \"Lyceum,\" he is either among the regular appointees for a\r\nrecitation, or is called out by acclamation for a voluntary one.  Max\r\nshines chiefly in debate, in which he is always ready to take either\r\nside, of any question.  Indeed he sometimes speaks on both sides of the\r\nsame question, and displays his ingenuity by refuting his own arguments.\r\n\r\nThese meetings have thus far been exceedingly pleasant, and on many a\r\nnight when the driving rain was beating upon roof and window, and the\r\nwind was howling dismally around our solitary cabin, all has seemed\r\nbright and cheerful within, as Max and Morton carried on a spirited\r\ndebate, or Browne declaimed Wolsey's soliloquy, or \"To be, or not to be,\r\nthat is the question.\"\r\n\r\nThe minutes of one meeting of the Lyceum may answer as a sample of their\r\nentertainments:--\r\n\r\nRecitation, (by Johnny), Lines supposed to have been written by\r\nAlexander Selkirk, \"I am monarch of all I survey,\" etcetera.\r\n\r\nRecitation, (by Browne), Clarence's Dream.\r\n\r\nEssay, (by the President), on the traditions of a Deluge, to be found\r\namong the Polynesian tribes.\r\n\r\nEssay, (by myself), The theory of the formation and structure of Coral\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nDebate.  Question: Is childhood the happiest period of human life?\r\n\r\nAffirmative maintained by Max, negative by Morton.\r\n\r\nSumming up of the arguments by the President and decision by him in the\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\nReading of the Polynesian Intelligencer, by the Editor, (Max).\r\n\r\nRecitation, (by Eiulo), a Tewan War-song, in the original.\r\n\r\nAfter the first protracted rain was over, there were frequent intervals\r\nof fine weather, which lasted sometimes several days.  But we found on\r\ngoing forth, that a change had taken place in the condition of things,\r\nwhich rendered any long excursion, even during these intervals, entirely\r\nout of the question.\r\n\r\nConsiderable streams poured down from the higher ground toward the\r\ninterior, and traversed the island at short distances, presenting\r\nformidable barriers to all travelling.  The ground was everywhere so\r\nmiry that it was difficult to avoid sinking above the ankles at every\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nAs the season advanced it became still worse, and at length we confined\r\nourselves almost entirely to the house.  Lately, however, there has been\r\na very perceptible improvement; the rains have become lighter, and less\r\nfrequent, and the season is evidently drawing towards its close.  We are\r\nalready discussing our plans for the summer, and have resolved upon a\r\nthorough exploration of the island, as soon as the fine weather has been\r\nlong enough established to remove the effects of the heavy rains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE SEPARATION.\r\n\r\nOUR SECLUSION INVADED--SPRING IN THE TROPICS--THE EXCURSION AND ITS\r\nCONSEQUENCES.\r\n\r\n  \"Reviving Nature bounds as from her birth:\r\n  The sun is in the heavens, and life on earth;\r\n  Flowers in the valley, splendour in the beam,\r\n  Health in the breeze, and freshness in the stream.\"\r\n\r\nI resume my narrative, under circumstances widely different from those\r\nin which the preceding chapter was written.  The events of the last few\r\ndays have completely changed the aspect of affairs in our little world.\r\nThe peace, the seclusion, the security, with which in our minds it had\r\nhitherto been invested, exist no longer.  Our quiet life, so free from\r\nvicissitudes and alarms, as to seem almost monotonous, has been rudely\r\nbroken into, and in a few days we are to take a step which cannot fail\r\nto be attended with consequences momentous to us, but whether fraught\r\nwith good or evil, it is impossible to foresee.  This, however, is\r\nanticipating the regular course of events.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely credible, how short a time after the cessation of the\r\nrains, sufficed to remove every trace of their effects.  Three or four\r\ndays of sunshine seemed to restore things to nearly the condition, in\r\nwhich we found them on first reaching the island.\r\n\r\nIt is true the vegetation now had a fresher look than before, and\r\nslender brooks still murmured through ravines usually dry; the lake,\r\ntoo, formerly so limpid, was somewhat discoloured by the turbid streams\r\nrunning into it from the surrounding heights; but the standing pools of\r\nwater had evaporated, and the ground had, in most places, become once\r\nmore firm and dry.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the weather was fairly established, we made several\r\nexcursions in various directions, though not to any considerable\r\ndistance.  On visiting Castle-hill, we found nothing left of our house\r\nthere, except the foundation; the entire framework, having been swept\r\naway by the wind.  A large candle-nut tree, just before the door, had\r\nbeen struck by lightning, and the blasted and blackened trunk, sadly\r\nmarred the beauty of the spot.\r\n\r\nArthur had selected a favourable location on the margin of the lake near\r\nthe fish-pond, for a taro and patara patch; and we spent several days in\r\nransacking the neighbouring woods for roots, with which to stock it.\r\nYams, we had not yet succeeded in finding, though they are indigenous in\r\nmost of the Polynesian islands, and we had made diligent search for them\r\nin the localities where they are usually found.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning, soon after the cessation of the rains, Arthur proposed\r\nan expedition into the interior, following the course of the stream\r\nupward towards its source.  In addition to the general object of\r\nexploration, he had in view the discovery of the much-coveted vegetable\r\nlast-mentioned, there being one large variety of it, which is found\r\ngrowing wild among the mountains, or upon the sides of the hills of the\r\ninterior.  All received the suggestion with cordial approval, being\r\nparticularly pleased with the proposed route, along the banks of the\r\nbrook.  Johnny, exulting in his recovered liberty, after the long\r\nimprisonment of the winter, and anticipating all sorts of wonderful\r\ndiscoveries in the vegetable, floral, and ornithological departments, at\r\nonce enlisted Eiulo and himself as members of the party of exploration.\r\n\r\nAs we were about to enter a region, with the resources of which, in the\r\nway of provisions, we knew nothing, we considered it a measure of wise\r\nprecaution to fortify ourselves against the fatigues of the journey, by\r\na hearty breakfast of broiled fish and roasted taro.  This important\r\nduty having been conscientiously attended to, our remaining preparations\r\noccupied but little time, and we set out at an early hour.\r\n\r\nJohnny, equipped with his longest bow, and an abundant stock of arrows,\r\nin readiness for the appearance of anything in the shape of a jackal or\r\na tiger-cat, marched valiantly in advance, while Eiulo, in the capacity\r\nof armour-bearer, or trusty esquire, followed, carrying his cutlass.\r\nNext, carefully surveying the ground we passed over, came Arthur, with a\r\nbag upon his arm, and a basket of cocoa-nut leaflets in his hand, ready\r\nfor the reception of the yams, when found, and of all sorts of roots,\r\nplants, and botanical specimens, that might be discovered in the\r\nmeantime.\r\n\r\nMax was armed to the teeth, as though in preparation for a pitched\r\nbattle.  By his side, in a belt of hibiscus bark, was stuck his cutlass:\r\nin one hand he carried a \"spear,\" and in the other, one of his \"Feejee\r\nwar-clubs.\"  Morton and myself were provided with a cutlass apiece; and\r\nBrowne, without having encumbered himself even to that extent, strolled\r\nleisurely along with his hands in his pockets, whistling \"blue-bonnets\r\nover the border.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now the spring of the tropical year: the deciduous trees were\r\nrenewing their verdure, and were covered with young shoots, and bursting\r\nleaf-buds.  Even the evergreens--though they change but little\r\nthroughout the year, and the old leaves and the new, the blossoms and\r\nthe ripe fruit, may be seen upon the same tree at almost every season,\r\nlooked brighter and fresher than before the rains.  The earth was\r\ncarpeted with beautiful grasses, mingled with tufts of moss, and bunches\r\nof fern.  Blue and white flowers were scattered about almost as\r\nprofusely as the \"pinkster blossoms,\" in April, in the woods at home;\r\nand in sheltered places, the modest cape-jasmine was beginning to unfold\r\nits fragrant leaves.  A delightful freshness filled the air, and there\r\nwas as yet, at this early hour, nothing to remind us that we were\r\nbeneath the fervent skies of the burning zone.\r\n\r\nRejoicing and exhilarated at finding himself in the woods once more,\r\nJohnny ran furiously hither and thither, closely attended by Eiulo,\r\ngathering wild-flowers, ferns and mosses; chasing bugs, beetles, and\r\nbutterflies; and letting fly his arrows at every unfortunate member of\r\nthe feathered community that came within the range of his archery.  In\r\nevery thicket and almost at every step, he came upon something to call\r\nforth the most boisterous exclamations of surprise or delight.  He was\r\nmanifestly in the state of mind declared by the poet to be so eminently\r\nhappy and desirable--\r\n\r\n  \"To all exhilarating influences,\r\n  Of earth and heaven alive!\"\r\n\r\nScarcely a moment passed, that he did not come running all aglow and out\r\nof breath to Arthur, with eager questions about something or other which\r\nhe had just seen, and then dash off again into the forest without\r\nwaiting for a reply, where fresh explosions of admiration or wonder,\r\nwould soon announce new, and if possible, still more astounding\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nThe shores of the stream were picturesque and varied.  For the first\r\nhalf-mile from our starting-point, it wound between smooth grassy banks,\r\nadorned with scattered clumps of trees.  It then entered a dense wood,\r\nwhere its channel was a rugged ravine, inclosed between steep rocks of\r\nblack basalt.  Here, the scraggy, ill-conditioned trees were crowded\r\ntogether, and overgrown with gigantic creepers.  The branches, reaching\r\nacross from the opposite shores, were interlaced and matted into thick\r\nmasses, almost excluding the light of day.  Max here displayed his\r\nagility, by laying hold of a long bough which extended from bank to\r\nbank, and walking \"hand over hand\" across the stream that flowed darkly\r\nand sluggishly some twelve or fifteen feet below.\r\n\r\nWe were an hour at the least, in toiling through this tangled wood,\r\nthough it did not extend more than half a mile.  After leaving it behind\r\nus, frequent rapids showed that we were steadily ascending as we\r\nproceeded.  Birds, such as we had not before seen on the island, and\r\nwhich reminded me of some of my old acquaintances of the New England\r\nwoods, perched upon the trees, or flew familiarly around us.  One or\r\ntwo, of the woodpecker tribe, looked wonderfully natural and home-like,\r\nas they sat industriously drumming upon hollow logs.  Another, a small,\r\nbrown bird, with modest plumage, surprised and delighted me, by a clear,\r\nfull whistle, that sounded not unlike that of our own robin redbreast.\r\nWe also saw numbers of a species of pigeon with black bills,\r\nslate-coloured bodies, and a ruff of white feathers about the neck.  One\r\nof these Johnny brought down with his bow, besides wounding very\r\nseriously, (as he alleged), a considerable number of others.  The\r\nwoodpeckers and whistlers enjoyed a temporary immunity from his\r\nformidable shafts, reluctantly granted them at my intercession in their\r\nbehalf, on the score of old associations.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour before noon we reached a spot where the stream was divided\r\nby a rocky islet, around which it spread out like a small lake.  A\r\ngrove, of a very peculiar appearance, and seeming to consist of a single\r\ntree, sheltered and overspread the entire spot.\r\n\r\nHere we concluded to halt, beginning by this time to feel quite tired,\r\nand inclined to rest.  The water was shallow at this point, and Max\r\nwading over to the little island, presently called upon us to follow him\r\nif we wished to behold \"a veritable banyan tree.\"  Whether a banyan or\r\nnot, (Arthur pronounced it to be a species of barren fig), it was\r\ncertainly a wonderful specimen of vegetation.  The main trunk, springing\r\nup in the centre of the islet, was nearly three feet in diameter.  At\r\nthe height of some fifteen feet from the ground, large branches extended\r\nhorizontally in every direction.  From these branches, at regular\r\nintervals, pendulous, vine-like shoots sprouted and grew downwards until\r\nthey reached the ground, where they took root, and gradually increasing\r\nin size formed new trunks or pillars, to support a further extension of\r\nthe branches.  This process of growth had gone on until the tree had\r\noverrun the entire island, resembling a flat roof of green branches,\r\nresting upon rows of columns.  Some of the perpendicular shoots had not\r\nyet reached the ground, others had just taken root, and were slender and\r\nflexible, while many of the older ones rivalled the parent stem in size,\r\nand could not easily be distinguished from it.\r\n\r\nWhile we rested here, a pair of the little brown songsters alighted\r\namong the branches of the \"banyan,\" and entertained us with a vocal\r\nperformance, in which they took up the strain alternately, responding to\r\neach other, and occasionally uniting in a chorus.\r\n\r\nMax now declared himself savagely hungry, and commenced exploring the\r\nneighbourhood in search of something eatable.  But no fruit-bearing\r\ntrees were to be found, and he returned from his foraging expedition\r\nprotesting that the country was a perfect desert, and declaring that he\r\nfor one would not proceed a step farther until he took up the line of\r\nmarch for home.  We were all of the opinion that we had done enough for\r\none day, and it was agreed that, after resting ourselves a short time,\r\nwe should commence our return.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Arthur caught sight of some trees upon a ridge of land a short\r\ndistance further up the stream, whose foliage resembled, as he thought,\r\nthat of the \"auti,\" or cloth plant.  Saying that he would return in a\r\nfew moments, he walked along the west bank of the brook in the direction\r\nof the ridge, followed by Johnny and Eiulo, who seemed as animated and\r\nunwearied as ever.  Presently they turned a bend in the stream, and we\r\nlost sight of them.  For lack of more interesting occupation, I began to\r\ncount the stems of the grove-tree.  There were seventeen, of large size,\r\nand a great number of smaller ones.  Max discovered a deep pool at the\r\nlower end of the islet, in which were a number of fish, marked like\r\nyellow perch: and as he had a fishing-line of Eiulo's manufacture, in\r\nhis pocket he amused himself by angling, using wood-beetles for bait.\r\nMorton and Browne hunted up four flat stones, and commenced pitching\r\nquoits.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour passed in these various ways, we began to wonder at\r\nArthur's long delay, and to grow impatient for his return.  I had\r\ncounted every stem of the banyan-fig, great and small.  Max had become\r\nquite disgusted with angling for fish, which were too wary, or too\r\nwell-fed, to favour him with even a nibble.  Browne, after being beaten\r\nfor five successive games, had very naturally lost his interest in the\r\nsport, and tossed his quoits into the brook.\r\n\r\nAnother half-hour passed, and still the absentees failed to make their\r\nappearance.  Max now professed to be suffering from the pangs of hunger,\r\nand longed for the sight even of the much-abused cocoa-nut tree.  At\r\nlast our patience being utterly exhausted, we resolved to go in search\r\nof Arthur and his suite, whose protracted absence greatly surprised us.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the point, or bend, behind which they had disappeared, we\r\nhallooed loudly, but there was no answer.  As we proceeded, the ground\r\nbecame very rough and broken, and the bed of the brook was full of loose\r\nrocks.  A little further on, the noise of a waterfall was heard, and\r\nafter one or two more turns, we reached a spot where the stream leaped\r\ndown a precipice some twenty feet.  Our further progress in the\r\ndirection we were pursuing was barred by a wall of rock; an active and\r\nfearless climber might, it is true, have scaled it by the aid of the\r\nstunted shrubs and jutting crags upon its face, but we knew that Arthur\r\naccompanied by Eiulo and Johnny, could not have passed on by any such\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nProceeding to the left, along the foot of the precipice, and pausing at\r\nshort intervals to repeat our halloos, we at last reached a wide fissure\r\nin the rock, by scrambling through which we gained the higher level.\r\nThis was in all probability a part of the ridge which Arthur had seen\r\nfrom the islet.  We now returned along the brow of the precipice until\r\nwe came to the waterfall, where we shouted again, but still without\r\ngetting any answer.  To push the search further in this direction seemed\r\nuseless, for it was morally certain that Arthur would not have continued\r\nbeyond this point up the stream; the understanding with which he had\r\nleft us, forbade any such supposition.\r\n\r\nWe began now to feel alarmed, and to fear that some accident had\r\nbefallen them, though of what nature we were at a loss to conjecture.\r\nMorton suggested the possibility that they had taken the opposite bank\r\nof the brook, and that while we were looking for them, they might have\r\nreturned to the islet.  This seemed not improbable, and striving hard to\r\nconvince ourselves that it must be so, we regained the lower level by\r\nthe same pass through which we had ascended, and hastened along the base\r\nof the height, and down the shore of the stream till we reached the\r\nislet again.  But our companions were not there.  Still, they might have\r\nreturned during our absence, and supposing that we had started homeward,\r\nproceeded after us.  We were greatly perplexed what course to pursue.\r\nIf we delayed our return much longer, we should not be able to reach the\r\ncabin before night set in: the wilderness around seemed to contain\r\nnothing that could serve as food, and we should have to fast as long as\r\nwe remained in it.  Then, too, our waiting longer could be of no benefit\r\nto the others, even if they had not yet returned to the islet.  Upon\r\nfinding us gone, they would know at once that we had set out for home,\r\nand there was no possibility of their mistaking their way thither.\r\n\r\nWe concluded, accordingly, to return without further delay.  Browne cut\r\na stout stick, and planted it in the sand at the margin of the brook,\r\narranging a number of large pebbles at its foot, in the form of a hand,\r\nwith the index finger pointing homeward.  We then set out at a brisk\r\npace, with some hope, but little actual expectation, of overtaking our\r\ncompanions on the war.\r\n\r\nWe soon reached the thick wood with its matted undergrowth, and the old\r\nand knotted vines twining like enormous reptiles around the trunks of\r\nthe trees; and so slow was our progress through it, that, when we\r\nemerged into the open country, it was nearly sunset.  The remaining\r\ndistance was more rapidly accomplished.  As we drew nigh to the cabin, I\r\nbegan to look anxiously for the appearance of the missing ones.  Each\r\nmoment I expected to see Johnny rushing towards us with a laughing boast\r\nof having \"beaten us home.\"  But no one came forth to meet us, and I\r\nthought that the valley had never before looked so lonely.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, entirely deserted.  The parrot was perched in\r\nsolitary state upon the eaves of the cabin, and as we opened the gate,\r\nhe flapped his wings, and croaked forth in dismal tones a sentence which\r\nJohnny, little dreaming of its present application, had been at much\r\npains to teach him:--\"Poor Paul's lonesome!\" he cried, \"they're all\r\ngone--all gone!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\r\n\r\nTHE SEARCH.\r\n\r\nHOME SWEET HOME--MAX ON MOONLIGHT--FOLLOWING A TRAIL--THE CONCEALED\r\nCANOE.\r\n\r\n  \"Where'er thou wanderest, canst thou hope to go\r\n  Where skies are brighter, or the earth more fair?\r\n  Dost thou not love these aye-blue streams that flow,\r\n  These spicy forests, and this golden air?\r\n\r\n  \"O yes!  I love these woods, these streams so clear,\r\n  Yet from this fairy region I would roam,\r\n  Again to see my native hills--thrice dear!\r\n  And seek that country, of all countries,--Home.\"\r\n\r\nMax hastened to collect fuel, and kindle a fire, in order to prepare\r\nsome food.  Assuming, as usual, the entire superintendence and control\r\nof the culinary department, and every thing connected therewith, he set\r\nBrowne to work washing and scraping tara-roots, despatched me after a\r\nfresh supply of fuel, and sent Morton with the hand-net down to the\r\nfish-pond to take out a couple of fish for a broil.  But while thus\r\nfreely assigning tasks to the rest of us, with the composed air of one\r\naccustomed to the exercise of unquestioned authority, he by no means\r\nshrunk from his own fair share of the work; and having got the fire\r\nburning cleverly by the time that Morton returned with the fish, he\r\nrolled up his sleeves, and with an air of heroic fortitude, commenced\r\nthe necessary, but somewhat unpleasant process of cleaning them.\r\n\r\nNight had now set in, but the sky being perfectly clear, and the moon at\r\nher full, it was scarcely darker than at early twilight.\r\n\r\nMax seemed to prolong his culinary operations to the utmost, either from\r\npure love of the employment, or with the still lingering hope, that our\r\ncompanions might yet arrive in time to partake of our supper.\r\n\r\nAt last however, it became apparent that the cookery could not, without\r\nserious detriment, be longer protracted.  The bursting skin of the taro\r\nrevealed the rich mealy interior, and eloquently proclaimed its\r\nreadiness to be eaten.  The fish were done to a turn, and filled the\r\ncabin with a savoury odour, doubly grateful to our nostrils after a\r\ntwelve hours' fast.  Max declared with a sigh, that another moment upon\r\nthe gridiron would ruin them, and he was reluctantly compelled to serve\r\nup the repast without further delay, when, notwithstanding our growing\r\nanxiety on account of Arthur's absence, we made a hearty meal.  After\r\nfeeding Monsieur Paul, and setting by some food in readiness for our\r\ncompanions when they should arrive, as we still hoped they would do in\r\nthe course of the evening, we went out to a spot above the cascade,\r\nwhere Morton and Browne had arranged some rude fragments of basalt, so\r\nas to form a semicircle of seats, which, if less comfortable than\r\nwell-cushioned arm-chairs would have been, might at any rate be\r\nconsidered in decidedly better \"rural taste,\" and in more harmonious\r\nkeeping with the character of the surrounding scene.\r\n\r\nFrom this point we could trace the windings of the brook for some\r\ndistance in one direction, while below us, in the opposite one, spread\r\nthe moonlit lake, reflecting in its mirror-like surface the dark masses\r\nof foliage that fringed its shores.  It was one of those tranquil,\r\ndreamy nights, known only in tropical countries.  A subtle fragrance of\r\nfresh buds and blossoms filled the air.  The light streamed in a silvery\r\nflood upon the tufted tops of the groves; while in the solemn shade\r\nbeneath, the serried trunks reared themselves in long ranks, like the\r\ngrey columns of some Gothic ruin.\r\n\r\nAs we sat listening to the murmur of the waterfall, the rustling of the\r\ntrees, and the distant and muffled booming of the surf, I fell into a\r\ndreamy reverie, which was at length dissipated by Browne's voice--\r\n\r\n\"Can any thing be more beautiful than this scene at this moment!\"\r\nexclaimed he, \"and yet I do not know when I have experienced such a\r\nweariness of it all--such an intense longing for home, as I feel\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall begin to believe in mesmeric sympathy,\" said Morton, \"I was\r\nmyself just thinking of home.  Home, sweet home!\" and he heaved a\r\nlong-drawn sigh.\r\n\r\nYes! the charm and illusion of our island life had long ended.  We were\r\ntired of tropical luxuriance, and eternal summer.  Glowing skies, and\r\nlandscapes like a picture, had almost ceased to gratify even the eye.  I\r\nlonged for a glimpse of a rugged New England hill once more.  A gnarled\r\nNew England oak, though stripped by wintry winds of every leaf, would be\r\na sight more grateful to me, than all those endless groves of waving\r\npalms.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot believe,\" resumed Browne, \"that we are destined to waste our\r\ndays in this lonely spot, elysium as it is, of external beauty.  We have\r\nfaculties and desires, which can find no scope here, and which are\r\nperishing for lack of exercise.  Still it is possible.  But it is a\r\ndreary, dreary thought!  I can now feel the pathos of the words of the\r\nancient mariner on coming in sight of his native land--\r\n\r\n  \"`Oh dream of joy! is this indeed\r\n  The light-house top I see?\r\n  Is this the hill? is this the kirk?--\r\n  Is this mine own countree?\r\n\r\n  \"`We drifted o'er the harbour bar\r\n  And I with sobs did pray--\r\n  O let me be awake, my God!\r\n  Or let me sleep away!'\"\r\n\r\nBrowne recited the lines with a power and feeling, that affected even\r\nthe matter-of-fact Morton; Max hastened to show that he was above being\r\nso easily moved.\r\n\r\n\"All this comes,\" cried he, \"of lying here under the trees in the\r\nmoonlight.  Moonlight certainly has a tendency to make people melancholy\r\nand sentimental; it also makes them do foolish things.  The most absurd\r\nand unreasonable notions I ever entertained, came into my head by\r\nmoonlight, and wouldn't go away.  Only twenty-five minutes ago, we were\r\nquite a rational, practical set of persons, eating our supper, (a\r\nwell-cooked supper, too, though I say it myself), with a keen appetite,\r\nlike Christians.  And now, we have fallen to sighing and quoting poetry,\r\nand Browne waxes quite pathetic at the touching thought of getting a\r\nglimpse once more, of the smoky chimneys of Glasgow!  Finally, I have\r\nnearly caught the infection myself, and unless I escape out of the\r\nmoonlight presently, I dare say I also shall become quite\r\nlack-a-daisical, and commence a poetical apostrophe to my native village\r\nof Hardscrabble--or rather to plump little Susan Somers, my first love,\r\nat the `madam's' school, who affected my weak mind and susceptible heart\r\nto that extent, that in her bewildering presence my tongue clave to the\r\nroof of my mouth, while I grew red in the face like a perplexed turkey\r\ngobbler.  But what _can_ have become of Arthur and the rest?  Unless\r\nsomething had happened to them, they must have returned before now.\"\r\n\r\nA little before midnight we retired to the cabin to sleep, having first\r\nagreed, that in the morning three of us should proceed up the stream\r\nagain, to make a thorough search for our companions, the fourth\r\nremaining behind until near noon, when, if the absentees had not yet\r\nreturned, he should set out to join the others at the islet below the\r\nfalls, which we fixed upon as the rendezvous.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, lots were drawn to determine which of us should remain\r\nat the cabin, and that duty fell to Morton.  The rest of us, having\r\narmed ourselves, and prepared a supply of taro and bread-fruit,\r\nsufficient, as we supposed, for several days, set out, soon after\r\nsunrise.  Our progress was much more rapid than it had been when we\r\nfirst went over the ground, as we now had a definite object in view, and\r\npressed steadily forward, without allowing any thing to interrupt or\r\ndelay us.  In an hour and a half after starting, we came in sight of the\r\nislet.  Opposite it was the stake which Browne had planted in the sand,\r\njust as we had left it.  We pushed on up the stream to the cascade, and\r\ncrossing to the right bank, we began to skirt the base of the rocky wall\r\non that side, looking carefully around for some traces of our\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nWe had proceeded in this way, about one hundred yards from the brook,\r\nwhen I picked up one of Johnny's arrows in a tuft of fern.  This was\r\nconclusive evidence that we were upon the right track.  A little farther\r\non, was a piece of marshy ground, and here we made a startling\r\ndiscovery.  In the soft soil, several foot-prints could be plainly\r\ndistinguished.  Some were coarse, shapeless impressions, precisely such\r\nas would be made by the rude moccasins worn by Arthur and Johnny.\r\nOthers were the prints of naked feet, and some of these were of far too\r\nlarge a size to be made by either of the three.  This discovery affected\r\nus for the moment like an electric shock, and we stood looking at one\r\nanother without speaking, and scarcely breathing, while the very beating\r\nof our hearts might be heard.\r\n\r\nBrowne was the first to recover himself, when he commenced a close\r\nexamination of all the tracks.  The piece of ground upon which they\r\ncould be traced, extended some thirty yards, and after a careful\r\nscrutiny of the whole of it, we became convinced that at least four\r\npersons, besides our three companions, had recently passed over it.  All\r\nthe tracks were not in the same direction, and from finding those of\r\nprecisely the same size lying in opposite directions, we inferred that\r\nsome of these persons, at least, had passed and repassed the spot.\r\n\r\nThe most distressing surmises as to the cause of the disappearance of\r\nour companions, now began to suggest themselves.  We were so astounded\r\nby this decisive evidence of the presence of strangers upon the island,\r\nthat we scarcely knew what to do next, but at last concluded to return\r\nto the islet and await Morton's arrival, being anxious to avoid the risk\r\nof any further division of our numbers.  We accordingly retraced our way\r\nthither: supposing that Morton would have set out before we could reach\r\nthe cabin, and that we might pass each other on the way without knowing\r\nit, if we should proceed down the stream to meet him, we remained\r\nquietly at the islet, keeping a vigilant and somewhat nervous look-out\r\non every side.\r\n\r\nHe arrived about noon, having started rather sooner than had been agreed\r\nupon.  On being informed of the tracks which had been discovered, he\r\nsaid that we ought at once to trace them as far as we were able.  \"We\r\nmust not rest,\" said he, \"until we know something more of this, even if\r\nwe have to traverse every inch of ground on the island.\"\r\n\r\nBrowne was inclined to infer from the foot-prints, that the interior,\r\nand the eastern part of the island, of which we as yet knew nothing,\r\nwere inhabited, and that our companions had fallen into the hands of the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\n\"Let us, in the first place, find, if possible, where they are.  We can\r\nthen judge what is to be done, if indeed we can do any thing,\" said\r\nMorton, \"and now for the place where the tracks you speak of are to be\r\nseen.\"\r\n\r\nGrasping our weapons, which were no longer to be regarded as a useless\r\nincumbrance, we once more proceeded up the brook, and soon reached the\r\npiece of low ground before mentioned.  We again narrowly inspected the\r\ntracks: Morton measured them with a twig, and concluded, as we had\r\npreviously done, that these were the foot-prints of at least seven\r\npersons--there being that number of clearly different sizes.  Three of\r\nthese were without doubt the tracks of Arthur, Johnny, and Eiulo.  The\r\nimpressions made by the moccasins of the two former led only in one\r\ndirection, (_from_ the stream), while those of the naked feet, (or of\r\nsome of them), were in two opposite directions.  Following these tracks\r\neastward along the rocky ridge, we soon came to firm dry ground, where\r\nfootsteps could no longer be traced.  But by a minute scrutiny, we were\r\nstill able to detect slight but decisive indications of the course of\r\nthe party whose trail we were endeavouring to follow.\r\n\r\nIn one place, a bunch of spreading ferns had been trodden down, and the\r\nlong graceful fronds bruised and broken: in another, a cluster of\r\ncrushed wild-flowers betrayed a recent footstep.  A little further on,\r\nwe came to a wide, meadow-like expanse, where the grass and weeds grew\r\nrank and tall, and through this the path of a considerable party could\r\nbe readily traced.  Gradually becoming accustomed to this species of\r\nminute investigation, as we continued carefully to practise it, we soon\r\ngrew so expert and skilful, that things very slight in themselves, and\r\nwhich would ordinarily have altogether escaped notice, sufficed to guide\r\nand direct us.\r\n\r\nThe path trodden through the meadow, led to the foot of an ascent, up\r\nwhich we followed the trail slowly and with difficulty, the soil being\r\nhard, and the vegetation scanty.  On gaining the top, we found that we\r\nhad reached the eastern, or south-eastern extremity of the island, and\r\nthe sea spread before us, almost at our feet.  The trail led directly\r\ntowards the edge of a steep bank, just above the shore, near which we\r\nlost it altogether.  Morton leaped down the bank some ten or twelve\r\nfeet, while the rest of us were looking round for easier and more\r\ngradual means of descent.  Finding a stunted tree springing from the\r\nlower ground, close against the bluff, I leaped among its spreading\r\nbranches, and climbed down its trunk to the shore, where I found Morton\r\nsearching for some traces of the party which we had tracked almost to\r\nthe edge of the height.\r\n\r\nIn a moment we were joined by Max and Browne, who had clambered down the\r\nface of the bank by the assistance of the shrubs and bushes growing upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"It is useless,\" said Browne, \"to look here for the trail we have lost.\r\nIf they descended to the shore, it must have been in some place where\r\nJohnny and Eiulo could have got down.\"\r\n\r\n\"The track seemed to lead directly to the sea,\" said Morton, \"and you\r\nmust consider that a party of savages would not find much of an obstacle\r\nin such a bank as this, and would scarcely be as careful as ourselves of\r\nthe safety of Johnny and Eiulo.  In fact, I suppose they would hand or\r\ndrop them down such a height, without scruple or ceremony.  What I now\r\nbegin to fear is, that our unfortunate companions have fallen into the\r\nhands of a party of savages, landing here for some transient purpose,\r\nand have been carried off by them.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment an exclamation from Max, who had walked a little way\r\nalong the beach, announced some discovery, and turning round we saw him\r\nbeckoning to us.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" said he, when we had joined him, stooping down, and\r\npointing towards a clump of stunted trees, growing in an angle or\r\nindentation, where the bluff fell back for a short distance from the\r\nshore, \"is it not a canoe drawn up under the trees?\"\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to distinguish the object clearly, on account of the\r\nthickness of the foliage.  After waiting a moment, and looking carefully\r\nabout, being satisfied that there was no one in the vicinity, we\r\napproached the spot.  Max was not mistaken; a large canoe, capable of\r\nholding fifteen or twenty persons, was lying among the bushes, where it\r\nhad evidently been placed for concealment.  In the bottom were a number\r\nof carved paddles, a mast wound about with a mat-sail, several\r\ncalabashes containing water, and some cocoa-nuts.\r\n\r\nHaving hastily noted these particulars, we withdrew to a short distance,\r\nbehind a rock detached from the bank, and surrounded by a dense growth\r\nof tangled shrubbery, to hold a consultation.\r\n\r\nFrom the position in which we found the canoe, with no dwelling near\r\nthat we could see, and from the circumstance of its containing water and\r\nprovisions, we inferred that it did not belong to persons inhabiting the\r\nisland, or this portion of it at any rate.  There was at least a\r\nprobability of its belonging to the party which we had tracked so nearly\r\nto the spot, and that they were now somewhere in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\"This canoe must be destroyed,\" said Morton, after a moment of silence,\r\n\"and we had better set about it at once.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition seemed a bold and a somewhat strange one.  Browne\r\ndemanded the object of such a proceeding.\r\n\r\n\"Unless we do this,\" answered Morton, \"our companions, if they are still\r\nalive, and in the power of the savages, may be carried away from the\r\nisland before our eyes, and separated from us for ever.  As long as they\r\nare here, within our reach, there is hope of our being able to rescue\r\nthem; if not by force, then by some device or stratagem.  At the worst,\r\nwe only run some unnecessary risk, by what I propose.  Could we ever\r\nforgive ourselves if Arthur should be carried off through our having\r\nomitted a precaution calculated to prevent it?\"\r\n\r\nMorton's decision and earnestness prevailed; while he undertook the work\r\nof destroying the canoe, Max, Browne, and I, stationed ourselves at\r\ndifferent points around the spot, so as to give timely notice of the\r\napproach of any person.  He devoted himself to his task with such\r\nvigour, that in a very few moments he had completely broken up the\r\nbottom of the canoe, by repeated blows of a stone as heavy as he could\r\nlift in both hands.  Not content with this, he disengaged the outrigger,\r\nand threw it, together with the mast and sail, into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\nTHE RENCONTRE.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO LEADERS--AN UNEXPECTED MEETING--THE COUNCIL OF WAR--AND WHAT\r\nFOLLOWED.\r\n\r\n  \"Now screw your courage to the sticking point.\"\r\n\r\n  \"With many a stiff thwack, many a bang,\r\n  Hard crab-tree and old iron rang;\r\n  While none who saw them could divine\r\n  To which side conquest would incline.\"\r\n\r\nI had climbed to the top of the bank as my look-out station, while the\r\nwork of demolishing the canoe was going forward, and on perceiving that\r\nMorton had accomplished his task, I was about to descend again, when\r\ntaking a final sweeping glance to the north and east, I observed several\r\nfigures moving rapidly along the beach, at a point somewhat less than a\r\nquarter of a mile distant, of which my position commanded a view, and\r\ncoming towards us.  In consequence of the indented character of the\r\nshore, and the height of the bank bordering it for some distance, they\r\npassed out of sight almost instantly.\r\n\r\nWithout losing a moment, I sprang down to the shore to communicate what\r\nI had seen.  Max, who had been posted upon the beach to keep a look-out\r\nnorthward, ran up at the same time, having also caught sight of the\r\npersons approaching us, as they came round a projecting point.\r\n\r\nWe now looked hurriedly around for some place of concealment, and Morton\r\npointed out a cluster of shrubs and rank weeds upon the verge of the\r\nbluff just above us, from which, without any risk of being seen\r\nourselves, we could command a view of the shore and those passing along\r\nit.  There was but little time for deliberation or choice, and hastily\r\nsummoning Browne from his post, where he was still on the watch, we\r\nscaled the almost perpendicular face of the height, with an ease and\r\ncelerity which would have been impossible under circumstances of less\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nIn the spot which Morton had designated, tall grass and flaunting weeds\r\nfringed the edge of the bluff, and we threw ourselves down among them,\r\nand awaited, with almost suspended breath, the approach of the persons I\r\nhad seen.\r\n\r\nWe were scarcely settled in our hiding-place, when a half-naked figure,\r\nswinging a short club in one hand, rushed into view.  Another, and\r\nanother followed, until I had counted seven of them.  They were\r\nwell-made, athletic men, of a fine olive colour, with long straight hair\r\nfalling over their shoulders.  The maro, which is a sort of fringed\r\nbelt, was their only clothing, and they carried spears and clubs of some\r\ndark-grained wood.\r\n\r\nAmong them was one striking figure.  It was that of an old man, of large\r\nand powerful frame, and a marked and resolute countenance, the\r\nexpression of which reminded me of an old lion which I had seen in some\r\nitinerant menagerie, years ago.  His massive head was covered with a\r\ntangled mass of iron-grey hair that streamed like a mane over his broad\r\nshoulders.  The club which he carried might have served Hercules\r\nhimself; it certainly would have severely tasked the strength of an\r\nordinary man to wield it.  I observed that all of them seemed to breathe\r\nquickly as though they had been running, or exerting themselves\r\nviolently in some way; and the old man, who came last looked backward\r\nonce or twice, as they came opposite us, in a way that caused me to\r\nsuppose that they were pursued.  The one who had first come in sight,\r\nwent towards the spot where the canoe was concealed, and upon seeing its\r\ncondition, uttered an exclamation of surprise that quickly brought the\r\nothers around him, when they all commenced gesticulating, and talking in\r\na low key, looking cautiously about every moment, as though apprehensive\r\nthat the perpetrators of the mischief might still be lurking near.\r\n\r\nThe old man, however, neither talked nor gesticulated, but stooping\r\ndown, he examined the canoe narrowly, as if to ascertain the precise\r\nextent of the injury done, and whether it admitted of any remedy.  When\r\nhe had completed his inspection he arose, and shaking his head\r\nsorrowfully, uttered some expression, which, accompanied as it was by a\r\nthreatening gesture with his ponderous club, sounded much like an\r\nemphatic imprecation.  Morton, who was crouching close beside me,\r\npeering cautiously through the tufts of grass, at what was going on\r\nbelow, gave a nervous start, as though the consciousness of the leading\r\npart he had taken in the mischief so recently wrought, made him consider\r\nhimself the special object of the old giant's fury.  One of them having\r\ngone back a little way along the beach, as if to reconnoitre, now\r\nreturned in haste, and made some announcement, upon hearing which the\r\nold man waved his hand, and the others immediately started off upon a\r\nfull run along the shore towards the south-west; he then followed them\r\nat a somewhat less hurried pace.\r\n\r\n\"They are certainly pursued, judging from their actions,\" whispered\r\nMorton, \"let us keep quiet, and see what comes next.\"\r\n\r\nBut a few minutes had passed, when half a dozen savages, resembling in\r\ntheir appearance and equipments those we had just seen, came in sight,\r\nrunning at full speed, but with the air of pursuers rather than of\r\nfugitives.  Straggling bands of two or three each followed at short\r\nintervals, all probably belonging to the same party, but scattered in\r\nthe heat of the chase.  Altogether, there must have been as many as\r\nfifteen or twenty of them.  A tall, wild-looking savage, large-framed,\r\nbut gaunt as a greyhound, and with a kind of fierce energy in all his\r\nmovements, seemed to be the leader of the pursuing party.  Just below us\r\non the beach, he turned and gave some order to a portion of his\r\nfollowers, speaking with great rapidity, and pointing towards the bluff;\r\nafter which he darted off again along the shore at a speed that seemed\r\nreally marvellous.  Those to whom he had spoken, immediately began, as\r\nif in obedience to the order just given, to climb the bank, not a dozen\r\nyards from the spot where we were lying.\r\n\r\nThe object of this movement undoubtedly was, to anticipate and frustrate\r\nany attempt on the part of the fugitives, to escape, by quitting the\r\nshore and making towards the interior.  The party thus detached had\r\nprobably been directed to continue the chase, keeping to the higher\r\nground.  If so, they would pass quite near our place of concealment, and\r\nthere was some danger of our being discovered, to avoid which, we\r\ncrouched close to the ground, and remained perfectly silent and\r\nmotionless.  The point where the savages were attempting to ascend was\r\nsteep and difficult, and several of them, apparently to disencumber\r\nthemselves for the effort of climbing, threw their clubs and spears\r\nbefore them to the top.  One of these weapons, a short, heavy club, fell\r\nnear me, and fearing that the owner might come to seek it, I hastily\r\ncast it to a conspicuous place, free from vegetation, a little distance\r\nfrom the bank, and nearer the spot where they were scaling it.  But the\r\nsavage had probably noticed where it first fell, for the next moment\r\nsome one came running directly towards the place, and just as I was\r\nexpecting to see him stumble into the midst of us, a deep guttural\r\nexclamation announced that we were discovered.  Any further attempt at\r\nconcealment was clearly idle, and we sprang up at once; the man was\r\nwithin three yards of us; he seemed quite as much startled as ourselves\r\nat so sudden a rencontre, and after standing for a minute looking at us,\r\nhe turned and ran off to his fellows.\r\n\r\n\"They will be back directly in a body,\" said Browne, \"and we must decide\r\nquickly what we are to do--whether to trust ourselves in their power, or\r\nto make such resistance as we can, if they undertake to meddle with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt if it would be safe to trust them,\" said Morton, \"at any rate I\r\ndon't like the idea of risking it.  There are but five or six of them;\r\nthe rest are far enough off by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish Arthur were here,\" said Browne, anxiously; \"he understands them\r\nand their ways, and could tell us what we ought to do.  I don't know\r\nwhat the probability is of their injuring us if we throw aside our arms\r\nand submit ourselves to them, and therefore I am loth to take the\r\nresponsibility of deciding the matter.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the savages appeared to be also holding a consultation.  They\r\nstood at a short distance talking rapidly, and pointing towards us.  At\r\nlength they began to approach the spot where we stood, but slowly, and\r\nwith some apparent hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Browne, \"we must come to a decision quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I distrust them entirely,\" exclaimed Morton, \"I am for acting on the\r\ndefensive.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I also,\" said Max, \"I have no faith in them: but perhaps they won't\r\nstop to interfere with us after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" said Browne, \"we will fight if we must.  But let us\r\nstand strictly on the defensive, and offer them no provocation.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help regarding this determination as unwise, but it was the\r\nmind of the majority; and the present was no time for divided or\r\nuncertain counsels.  I therefore kept my thoughts to myself, and\r\ngrasping my cutlass, prepared for what was to follow.\r\n\r\nBrowne and Max were armed with the \"Feejee war-clubs,\" of the latter's\r\nmanufacture: they were long, heavy bludgeons, of the wood of the\r\ncasuarina, rather too ponderous to be wielded with one hand by a person\r\nof ordinary strength.  Morton and I were provided with cutlasses, which\r\nwe had preferred as being lighter and more convenient to carry.\r\n\r\nThe savages were armed with spears and short clubs, the former of which\r\nthey presented towards us as they advanced.\r\n\r\nI confess that my heart began to thump against my breast with unwonted\r\nand unpleasant rapidity and violence.  I dare say it was the same with\r\nmy companions; but externally we were perfectly composed and steady.\r\n\r\n\"There are just five of them,\" said Browne, \"two antagonists for me, and\r\none apiece for the rest of you.  If any one interferes with my two I\r\nshall consider it a personal affront.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound those long spears!\" exclaimed Max, with a disturbed air, \"they\r\nhave a mighty uncomfortable look, with those fish-bone barbs at the end\r\nof them.\"\r\n\r\nThe still more \"uncomfortable\" thought that those fish-bone barbs were\r\nperhaps poisoned, suggested itself to me, but I considered it expedient\r\nto say nothing on the subject at the present juncture.\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" cried Browne, \"the long spears are easily managed, if you will\r\nonly remember my fencing-lessons, and keep your nerves steady.  It is\r\nthe simplest thing in the world to put aside a thrust from such a\r\nweapon: depend upon it, those short clubs will prove much more\r\ndangerous.\"\r\n\r\nThe savages, having now had a sufficient opportunity to note our\r\nequipments, and our youthful appearance, quickly lost all hesitation,\r\nand came confidently forward until they stood facing us, at the distance\r\nof but ten or twelve feet.  Then, seeing that we maintained a defensive\r\nattitude, they paused, and one of them, stepping a little before the\r\nrest, spoke to us in a loud and authoritative voice, at the same time\r\nmotioning us to throw aside our weapons.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you muster a few words of their heathen talk, Archer?\" said\r\nBrowne, \"perhaps if we could only understand one another, we should find\r\nthere is no occasion for us to quarrel.  It seems so irrational to run\r\nthe risk of having our brains knocked out, if it can be avoided.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head: the few phrases which I had picked up from Arthur and\r\nEiulo, could be of no use for the present purpose, even if they should\r\nbe understood.\r\n\r\nThe spokesman, a sinewy, hard-favoured savage, whose native ugliness was\r\nenhanced by two scars that seamed his broad squat face, repeated the\r\nwords he had before uttered, in a higher key, and with a still more\r\nimperative air, accompanying what he said, with gestures, which\r\nsufficiently explained what he required.\r\n\r\n\"If I understand you, my friend,\" said Browne, appearing to forget in\r\nthe excitement of the moment that what he was saying would be utterly\r\nunintelligible to the person he addressed, \"If I understand you, your\r\ndemand is unreasonable.  Throw away your own weapons first; you are the\r\nmost numerous party:\" and he imitated the gestures which the other had\r\nmade use of.\r\n\r\nThe savage shook his head impatiently, and keeping his eyes steadfastly\r\nfixed upon Browne, he began to speak in a quiet tone.  But I saw that\r\nthough looking at Browne, his words were addressed to his companions,\r\nwho gradually spread themselves out in front of us and without making\r\nany openly hostile demonstrations, handled their weapons in what seemed\r\nto me a suspicious manner.\r\n\r\n\"Be on your guard,\" said I, speaking in my ordinary tone, and without\r\nlooking round, \"I am sure they are meditating sudden mischief.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely were the words uttered, when, with the quickness of lightning,\r\nthe spokesman hurled his club at Browne, narrowly missing his head, then\r\nbringing his spear into a horizontal position, he made a thrust full at\r\nhis chest with his whole force.\r\n\r\nBrowne, however, was on his guard, and knocking aside the point of the\r\nspear, he swung round his long club; and, before the other could draw\r\nback, brought it down with such effect upon his right shoulder that his\r\narm fell powerless to his side, and the spear dropped from his grasp.\r\nBrowne promptly set his foot upon it, and the owner, astonished and\r\nmortified, rather than intimidated at his repulse, shrunk back without\r\nany attempt to regain it.\r\n\r\nThis attack was so sudden, and so soon foiled--being but a blow aimed,\r\nparried, and returned, in a single breath--that no one on either side\r\nhad an opportunity to interfere or join in it.  The other savages now\r\nuttered a yell, and were about to rush upon us: but the leader, as he\r\nappeared to be, motioned them back, and they drew off to a short\r\ndistance.  If we were for a moment inclined to hope that we should now\r\nbe left unmolested, we soon learned the groundlessness of such an\r\nexpectation.  The discomfited savage, instead of being discouraged by\r\nthe rough treatment he had received, was only rendered more dangerous\r\nand resolute by it; and he prepared to renew the attack at once, having\r\ntaken from one of his companions a club somewhat heavier and longer than\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" said Max, drawing a long breath as he eyed these ominous\r\nproceedings, \"that we had a few of Colt's revolvers, to keep these\r\nfellows at a respectable distance: I confess I don't like the notion of\r\ncoming to such close quarters with them as they seem to contemplate.\"\r\n\r\n\"A genuine Yankee wish!\" answered Browne, grasping his club with both\r\nhands, and planting himself firmly, to receive the expected onset; \"to\r\nmake it completely in character you have only to wish, in addition, for\r\na mud breastwork, or a few cotton bags, between us and our friends\r\nyonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which I do, with all my heart!\" responded Max, fervently.\r\n\r\n\"Let Kaiser Maximilien represent the high Dutch on this occasion,\" said\r\nMorton, edging himself forward abreast of Browne, who had stationed\r\nhimself a trifle in advance of the rest of us; \"he has no claim to speak\r\nfor the Yankees except the mere accident of birth.  Archer and I will\r\nuphold the honour of the stars and stripes without either revolvers or\r\ncotton bags.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fair play!\" cried Max, pushing Browne aside, \"I won't have you for a\r\nbreastwork at any rate, however much I may desire one of turf or cotton\r\nbales.\"  And we arranged ourselves side by side.\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Morton, with a faint apology for a smile, \"it appears\r\nthat we have to do with tacticians--they are going to outflank us.\"\r\nThis remark was caused by our antagonists separating themselves; the\r\nleader advancing directly towards us, while the others approached, two\r\non the right and two on the left.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Browne, \"we shall have to form a hollow square, officers in\r\nthe centre, as the Highlanders did at Waterloo, and then I shall claim\r\nthe privilege of my rank.\"\r\n\r\nBut our pleasantry was, as may easily be imagined, rather forced.  Our\r\nadversaries were now evidently bent upon mischief, and thoroughly in\r\nearnest.  We were none of us veterans, and notwithstanding an assumption\r\nof coolness, overstrained and unnatural under the circumstances, our\r\nbreath came thick and painfully with the intense excitement of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nAt a signal from their scarred leader, the savages rushed upon us\r\ntogether.  I can give no very clear account of the confused struggle\r\nthat ensued, as I was not at the time in a state of mind favourable to\r\ncalm and accurate observation.  A few blows and thrusts were exchanged;\r\nat first cautiously, and at as great a distance as our weapons would\r\nreach; then more rapidly and fiercely, until we became all mingled\r\ntogether, and soon each of us was too fully occupied in defending\r\nhimself to be able to pay much attention to any thing else.  At the\r\ncommencement of the attack I was standing next to Browne, who being\r\nevidently singled out by his former opponent, advanced a step or two to\r\nmeet him.  He skilfully parried several downright blows from the heavy\r\nclub of the latter, who in his turn dodged a swinging stroke which\r\nBrowne aimed at his head, and instantly closed with him.  The next\r\nmoment they went whirling past me towards the edge of the bank, locked\r\ntogether in a desperate grapple, which was the last that I saw of them.\r\nI was assailed at the outset by an active and athletic savage, armed\r\nwith a short club.  He was exceedingly anxious to close, which I, quite\r\nnaturally, was as desirous to prevent, knowing that I should stand no\r\nchance in such a struggle, against his superior weight and strength.\r\nWhile I was doing my best to keep him off with my cutlass, and he was\r\neagerly watching an opportunity to come to closer quarters, Morton,\r\nlocked in the grasp of a brawny antagonist, came driving directly\r\nbetween us, where they fell together, and lay rolling and struggling\r\nupon the ground at our feet.  My opponent, abandoning me for a moment,\r\nwas in the act of aiming a blow at Morton's head, when I sprang forward,\r\nand cut him across the forehead with my cutlass.  The blood instantly\r\nfollowed the stroke, and gushing in torrents over his face, seemed to\r\nblind him: he struck three or four random blows in the air, then reeled\r\nand fell heavily to the ground.  Throwing a hasty glance around, I\r\nperceived Max among some bushes at a little distance defending himself\r\nwith difficulty against a savage, who attacked him eagerly with one of\r\nthose long spears, towards which he entertained such an aversion.\r\nBrowne was nowhere to be seen.  Morton and his strong antagonist were\r\nstill grappling on the ground, but the latter had gained the advantage,\r\nand was now endeavouring, while he held Morton under him, to reach a\r\nclub lying near, with which to put an end to the struggle.  Another of\r\nthe enemy was sitting a few steps off apparently disabled, with the\r\nblood streaming from a wound in the neck.  I hastened to Morton's\r\nassistance, whereupon his opponent, seeing my approach, sprang up and\r\nseized the club which he had been reaching after.  But Morton gained his\r\nfeet almost as soon as the other, and instantly grappled with him again.\r\nAt this moment I heard Max's voice, in a tone of eager warning,\r\ncalling, \"Look-out, Archer!\" and turning, I saw the savage I supposed to\r\nbe disabled, with uplifted arm, in the very act of bringing down his\r\nclub upon my head.  I have a confused recollection of instinctively\r\nputting up my cutlass, in accordance with Browne's instructions for\r\nmeeting the \"seventh\" stroke in the broad-sword exercise.  I have since\r\nbecome convinced by reflection, (to say nothing of experience), that the\r\nprinciples of the broad-sword exercise, however admirable in themselves,\r\ncannot be applied without some modification when iron-wood clubs, with\r\nhuge knobs of several pounds' weight at the ends of them, are\r\nsubstituted for claymores.  However, I had no time then to make the\r\nproper distinctions, and as instead of dodging the blow, I endeavoured\r\nto parry it, my guard was beaten down--and that is all that I can relate\r\nof the conflict, from my own knowledge and personal observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\r\n\r\nRECONNOITRING BY NIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE SEARCH RENEWED--THE CAPTIVES--ATOLLO AND THE TEWANS.\r\n\r\n  \"Trembling, they start and glance behind\r\n  At every common forest-sound--\r\n  The whispering trees, the moaning wind,\r\n  The dead leaves falling to the ground;\r\n  As on with stealthy steps they go,\r\n  Each thicket seems to hide the foe.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when startled by Max's warning cry, I turned and saw the\r\nuplifted club of the savage suspended over my head, all is blank in my\r\nmemory, until opening my eyes with a feeling of severe pain, and no\r\ndistinct consciousness where I was, I found Browne and Max bending over\r\nme, my head being supported upon the knee of the former.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how do you feel?\" inquired he.\r\n\r\nI stared at him a minute or two without answering, not understanding\r\nvery clearly what was the matter with me, though having at the same time\r\na vague impression that all was not quite right.  Gradually I collected\r\nmy ideas, and at length, when Browne repeated his question the third\r\ntime, I had formed a pretty correct theory as to the cause of my present\r\nsupine attitude, and the unpleasant sensations which I experienced.\r\n\r\n\"I feel rather queer about the head and shoulders,\" I said, in answer to\r\nhis inquiry: \"I must have got a pretty severe blow.  I suppose!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Max, whose uneasy look ill agreed with his words and manner,\r\n\"see what it is to be blessed with a tough cranium; such a whack would\r\nhave crushed mine like an egg-shell; but it has only enlarged your bump\r\nof reverence a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing serious has happened, then--no one is badly hurt,\" said I,\r\ntrying to look around; but the attempt gave my neck so severe a wrench,\r\nand caused such extreme pain, that I desisted.\r\n\r\n\"No one has received any worse injury than yourself,\" answered\r\nBrowne--\"at least, none of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the savages--what has become of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have nothing to apprehend from them at present, I think--they have\r\nbeen gone but a short time, and Morton is in the tree yonder, keeping\r\nwatch for their return--do you feel now as if you can stand up and\r\nwalk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I can; with the exception of the pain in my head, and a\r\nstiffness about the neck and shoulders, I am all right, I believe.\"  And\r\nin order to convince Browne, who seemed somewhat sceptical on the point,\r\nnotwithstanding my assurances, I got up and walked about--carrying my\r\nhead somewhat rigidly, I dare say, for it gave me a severe twinge at\r\nevery movement.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"since that is the case, I think the wisest thing we\r\ncan do is to leave this neighbourhood at once.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Max went to summon Morton from his post of observation, Browne\r\ngave me a brief and hurried account of what had occurred after I had\r\nbeen felled, as related.\r\n\r\nHe, and the leader of the savages, whom I had last seen struggling upon\r\nthe brink of the height, had gone over it together; the latter, falling\r\nunderneath, had been severely bruised, while Browne himself received but\r\nlittle injury.\r\n\r\nLeaving his adversary groaning and, as he supposed, mortally hurt by the\r\nfall, he had climbed again to the higher ground, and reached it at a\r\nvery critical moment.\r\n\r\nMorton was struggling at disadvantage with the same formidable\r\nantagonist from whom he had before been for a moment in such imminent\r\ndanger; and Max was dodging about among the bushes, sorely pressed by\r\nanother of the enemy with one of those long spears, against which he\r\nentertained so violent a prejudice.  I had just been disposed of in the\r\nmanner above hinted at, by the savage who had been wounded in the neck\r\nby Morton, at the very commencement of the affray, and he was now at\r\nliberty to turn his attention either to Max or Morton, each of whom was\r\nalready hard bested.\r\n\r\nBrowne immediately fell upon my conqueror, almost as unexpectedly as the\r\nlatter had attacked me, and by a sudden blow stretched him senseless\r\nupon the ground.  He next relieved Morton, by disabling his adversary.\r\nThe two, then, hastened to Max's succour, but the savage who was engaged\r\nwith him, did not deem it prudent to await the approach of this\r\nreinforcement, and made off into the forest.  They then gathered up all\r\nthe weapons of the enemy, permitting Morton's recent antagonist to limp\r\noff without molestation.  The man whom I had wounded was by this time\r\nsitting up, wiping the blood from his face and eyes; the other, also,\r\nmanifested signs of returning consciousness; but having been deprived of\r\ntheir clubs and spears, no danger was apprehended from them.  My three\r\ncompanions had then carried me to the spot where we now were, from\r\nwhence they had witnessed the departure of the rest of our foes.  Even\r\nthe man whom Browne had left dying on the shore, as he supposed, had\r\nmanaged to crawl off at last.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Max and Morton returned, we set out at once, weary as we\r\nwere, for the islet in the brook, without any very definite notion as to\r\nwhat was to be done next.  The prudence of removing from our present\r\nneighbourhood was obvious, but we were still too much discomposed and\r\nexcited by what had just taken place, to have been able to decide upon\r\nany further step, even had not the momentary apprehension of the return\r\nof the savages in greater numbers rendered every thing like calm\r\ndeliberation entirely out of the question.\r\n\r\nWe took the precaution to choose our path over the hardest and dryest\r\nground, in order to afford the savages the fewest possible facilities\r\nfor tracing our course.  By the time we reached the islet, we were\r\ncompletely out by the fatigue and excitement of the day; we must have\r\nwalked at least twelve miles since morning.\r\n\r\nAfter partaking sparingly of the food which we had so fortunately\r\nbrought with us, accompanied by copious draughts of water from the\r\nbrook, we began to feel somewhat refreshed.  Still we were greatly\r\ndisheartened by the gloomy and distressing circumstances, in which we\r\nfound ourselves so suddenly involved; the great uncertainty as to the\r\nfate of our companions, and the danger that threatened our own lives\r\nfrom the vindictive pursuit of a numerous body of savages.  All our\r\nenergy and courage seemed for the present, at least, to be completely\r\nbroken.  Browne laid down upon a couch of dry fern beneath the\r\nmany-pillared Aoa.  He looked pale and ill--more so, I thought, than the\r\nmere effects of excitement and over-exertion could account for.\r\n\r\nMorton soon revived the question of what was now to be done.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we must remain here for the present, at least,\" said Browne,\r\n\"and defend ourselves, if attacked, as well as we can.\"\r\n\r\nMax suggested Palm-Islet as a place of greater security and one where we\r\nshould run less risk of discovery.\r\n\r\n\"And meantime,\" said Morton, \"are we to give up all attempt to find\r\nArthur and the rest?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know what we can do,\" answered Browne, with a perplexed and\r\ndiscouraged air; \"we have no clue to guide us in a fresh search.  If\r\nthese savages inhabit the island,--or if they remain here,--we cannot\r\nhope to escape them long, after what has taken place; we must fall into\r\ntheir hands sooner or later, and if they have captured our companions, I\r\nam willing for my part, that it should be so.  I doubt if we acted\r\nwisely in resisting them at all,--but it is now too late to think of\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nWe continued to talk the matter over for some time, but without coming\r\nto any definite resolution, and at length Browne dropped asleep, while\r\nwe were still discussing it.\r\n\r\nAs it began to grow dark, Max became disturbed and excited.  He was\r\npossessed by a vague conviction, for which he was unable to account,\r\nthat our lost companions were in some imminent peril, from which it was\r\nin our power to rescue them.  He was anxious to do something, and yet\r\nseemed uncertain what to propose.  Morton was equally desirous of making\r\na further effort to discover our lost friends; he was also quite clear\r\nand explicit, in his notion of what ought to be done.  His theory\r\nappeared to be, that they had fallen into the hands of the natives,\r\nwhose encampment or place of abode, (temporary or otherwise), was on the\r\nnorth-eastern side of the island.  He further supposed that some feud or\r\nquarrel having arisen among themselves, the worsted party had fled along\r\nthe beach as we had witnessed, pursued by their victorious enemies,--\r\nthat in the meantime, their captives had been left, (perhaps unguarded),\r\nat the encampment or landing-place of the natives.  Morton was as minute\r\nand detailed in stating this hypothetical case, as if he had either\r\nactually seen or dreamed the whole.  He proposed that as soon as the\r\nmoon rose, some of us should set off for the shore, and proceed along\r\nthe beach, in the direction from which we had seen the natives come, by\r\npursuing which course, he was confident we should be able to learn\r\nsomething respecting our companions.  This he wished to undertake alone,\r\nsaying that one person could prosecute the search as well as four, and\r\nwith much less risk of discovery: if successful in ascertaining any\r\nthing definite, he should, he said, immediately return and apprise the\r\nrest of us.  Max eagerly embraced this suggestion, and wished to decide\r\nby lot, which of us should carry it into execution, insisting that,\r\notherwise, he would either set off at once by himself, or accompany\r\nMorton.\r\n\r\nAt length Browne awoke; he said that he had derived much benefit from\r\nhis two hours' sleep, and was now ready for any necessary exertion.\r\n\r\nHe also approved of Morton's plan, but objected to his going alone, and\r\nwas at first in favour of setting out all together.  At last it was\r\nsettled that the search should be undertaken by two of us, the other two\r\nawaiting the result at the islet.  Browne then prepared four twigs for\r\nthe purpose of deciding the matter by lot, it being agreed that the one\r\ndrawing the longest, should have the choice of going or remaining, and\r\nshould also select his companion.  On comparing lots after we had drawn,\r\nmine proved to be longest; and having decided upon going, I felt bound\r\nto name Morton as my associate, since he had been the first to suggest,\r\nand the most earnest in urging the adventure.\r\n\r\nAn hour after dark the moon rose, and soon lighted the forest\r\nsufficiently to enable us to see our way through it.  We then armed\r\nourselves with a cutlass apiece, and taking leave of Max and Browne,\r\nproceeded up the brook to the fall, where we crossed it, and, following\r\nthe rocky ridge, which ran at right angles with it, we endeavoured to\r\nhold, as nearly as possible, the course we had taken in the morning.\r\nAfter leaving the stream, a good part of our way was through the open\r\ncountry, where there was nothing to prevent us from seeing or being seen\r\nat a considerable distance in the bright moonlight.  But the only\r\nalternatives were, either to creep on our hands and knees, the whole\r\ndistance from the edge of the forest to the shore, and so avail\r\nourselves of such concealment as the rank grass and weeds afforded,--or\r\nto push boldly and rapidly forward, at the risk of being seen: we\r\npreferred the latter, and soon got over this dangerous ground, running\r\npart of the time, in the most exposed places.  On reaching the bluff,\r\nover the beach, we lay down among the bushes a few moments to recover\r\nour breath, and reconnoitre, before taking a fresh start.  All was\r\nperfectly silent around us, and no living thing could be seen.  When\r\nsufficiently rested, we proceeded cautiously along the edge of the\r\nheight, where we could command a view both of the beach below, and of\r\nthe open country inland.  The bluff extended about a quarter of a mile,\r\nwhen it gradually sunk to the level of the beach, and was succeeded by a\r\nlow, flat shore, lined with large trees.  We had gone but a little way\r\nalong it after this change, when we came quite unexpectedly upon an\r\ninlet, or salt-water creek, setting in to the land, and bordered so\r\nthickly with mangroves, that we narrowly escaped going headlong into it,\r\nwhile endeavouring to force our way through the bushes to continue our\r\ncourse along the beach.\r\n\r\nIt was some twenty yards wide; but I could not see how far inland it\r\nran, on account of the immense trees that overhung it on every side,\r\nspringing up in great numbers just behind the low border of mangroves.\r\nHolding fast by one of these bushes, I was leaning forward over the\r\nwater, looking hard into the gloom, to gain, if possible, some notion of\r\nthe extent of the inlet and the distance round it, when Morton grasped\r\nmy arm suddenly--\r\n\r\n\"What is that, under the trees on the opposite shore?\" whispered he; \"is\r\nit not a boat?\"\r\n\r\nLooking in the direction in which he pointed, I could distinguish some\r\nobject on the opposite side of the inlet, that might from its size and\r\nshape be a boat of some kind, as he supposed, and, continuing to gaze\r\nsteadily, I made out quite plainly, against the dark masses of foliage\r\non the further shore, what appeared to be a white mast.  A profound\r\nsilence reigned all around us, and while I was still peering into the\r\nheavy shadow of the trees, I heard a sound which resembled a deep, and\r\nlong-drawn sigh, followed by an exclamation, as of a person in bodily\r\npain.\r\n\r\n\"We must get round to the other side,\" whispered Morton, \"and see what\r\nthis means.\"\r\n\r\nWe backed out of the mangroves with the utmost caution, and inch by\r\ninch: when we had got to such a distance as to render this extreme\r\ncircumspection no longer necessary, we commenced a wide circuit around\r\nthe inlet, which proved to be only a small cove, or indentation in the\r\nshore, extending less than a hundred yards inland.  In approaching it\r\nagain on the opposite side, we resumed all our former stealthiness of\r\nmovement, feeling that our lives in all probability depended upon our\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\nWhen, at last, we had got, as we supposed, quite near the place where we\r\nhad seen the boat, we proceeded, by creeping on our hands and knees\r\nthrough the bushes for short distances, and then rising and looking\r\nabout, to ascertain our position.\r\n\r\nIt was so dark, and the undergrowth was so dense--the moonlight scarcely\r\npenetrating the thick foliage--that nothing could be distinguished at\r\nthe distance even of a few yards, and there was some danger that we\r\nmight come suddenly, and before we were aware, upon those whom we\r\nsupposed to be already so near us.  While thus blindly groping our way\r\ntowards the edge of the inlet, I heard a voice almost beside me, which\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"Will they never come back?--Are they going to leave us here to starve?\"\r\n\r\nThe voice was that of Johnny's beyond the possibility of mistake.\r\nTurning in the direction from which it proceeded, I saw a little to the\r\nright three figures upon the ground at the foot of a large casuarina.\r\nAnother voice, as familiar, almost immediately answered--\r\n\r\n\"I only fear that they will return too soon: have patience! in a little\r\nwhile I shall have gnawed through this rope, and then I do not despair\r\nof being able to get my hands free also.\"\r\n\r\nThis was enough to show how matters stood.\r\n\r\n\"Are you alone?\" said I, in a low voice, but loud enough to be heard by\r\nthose beneath the casuarina.\r\n\r\nThere was an exclamation of joyful surprise from Johnny; then Arthur\r\nanswered, \"If that is you, Archer, come and help us, for we are tied\r\nhand and foot.  You have nothing to fear; our captors have left us quite\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nWe now came forward without further hesitation.  They were all bound\r\nfast, their hands being tied behind them, in addition to which, each was\r\nfastened to the tree by a rope of sennit.  It would be difficult to say\r\nwhich party seemed most rejoiced at this sudden meeting.  As soon as\r\nthey were liberated, we embraced one another with tears of joy.\r\n\r\n\"Let us leave this place as fast as possible,\" said Arthur, as soon as\r\nhe became a little composed, \"I expect the return of the natives every\r\nmoment,--and we have more to dread from them than you can guess.  But I\r\nfind I am so stiff after lying bound here all day, that I can hardly\r\nwalk.  Now, Johnny, take my hand, and try to get along.  How is it with\r\nyou, Eiulo--do you feel able to travel fast?\"\r\n\r\nThe latter appeared to understand the drift of the question, and\r\nanswered by frisking and jumping about in exultation at his recovered\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nInstead of returning by the way by which we had come, along the shore,\r\nwe pushed on in a straight line, in the supposed direction of the islet,\r\nin order to avoid the risk of meeting the natives.  After toiling for an\r\nhour through the woods, we emerged into the open country to the east of\r\nthe rocky ridge that traversed the course of the stream.  During this\r\ntime, we had been too fully occupied in picking our way with the\r\nnecessary caution, besides the constant apprehension of suddenly\r\nencountering the natives, to ask for any explanations.  But now we began\r\nto feel somewhat reassured, and as we hastened on towards the islet,\r\nArthur very briefly informed us, that they had yesterday been suddenly\r\nsurprised by a party of six natives, soon after leaving us at the islet,\r\nand hurried off to the shore: that they had been left by their captors\r\nthis morning, secured as we had found them, and had remained in that\r\ncondition until released by us.  He added that he had more to\r\ncommunicate by-and-bye.\r\n\r\nThe joy of Browne and Max at our return, accompanied by the lost ones,\r\nmay be imagined--but it can scarcely be described.  In fact, I am\r\nobliged to confess that we were such children, as to enact quite \"a\r\nscene,\" at this unexpected meeting.  Heartfelt and sincere were the\r\nthanksgivings we that night rendered to Him, who had kept us in perfect\r\nsafety, and reunited us, after a separation made so distressing by our\r\nuncertainty as to each other's fate.\r\n\r\nAfter Arthur, Eiulo, and Johnny, had appeased their hunger with the\r\nscanty remains of our supply of provisions, the two latter lay down upon\r\na bed of ferns beneath the Aoa, and were soon sleeping as soundly and\r\npeacefully, as though all our troubles and dangers were now at an end.\r\nHow easily they put in practice the philosophy that vexes itself not\r\nabout the future!  Exercising the happy privilege of childhood, they\r\ncast upon others, in whom they placed implicit confidence, the\r\nresponsibility of thinking and planning for them--free from all care and\r\nanxiety themselves.\r\n\r\nArthur now gave us a more detailed account of what had occurred since\r\nour separation.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember,\" said he, when he had finished, \"hearing Eiulo, in\r\ntalking of affairs at Tewa, make mention of a person named Atollo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Atollo?\" said Browne, \"was not that the name of an uncle of his whom he\r\nmade out to be a strange, unnatural sort of monster, even for a heathen,\r\nand who concocted a plot for the murder of his own father and brother,\r\nand afterwards attempted to kill Eiulo by rolling rocks down a precipice\r\nafter him in the woods!\"\r\n\r\n\"The same,\" answered Arthur.  \"I hardly supposed that you would have\r\nremembered it, as no one but myself seemed to take much interest in\r\nEiulo's reminiscences of Tewa, the rest of you being obliged to get them\r\nat second-hand, through me as interpreter.  Well, that Atollo has\r\nreached this island in some way, with a band of followers: it was by\r\nthem that we were captured yesterday; it is from his power that we have\r\njust escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this Atollo like?\" inquired Browne.  \"Is he a tall,\r\nlarge-framed man, but gaunt and spare as a half-starved hound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with sharp features, and a wild, restless eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then,\" continued Browne, turning to me, \"it was he, who was at the\r\nhead of the second party of natives that we saw this morning by the\r\nshore.\"\r\n\r\nWe now gave Arthur an account of our rencontre with the savages; but no\r\nparticular mention was made of the destruction of the canoe, or of the\r\nlion-like old man who seemed to be the leader of those who fled.\r\n\r\n\"And little Eiulo's dread of this strange uncle of his,\" said Browne,\r\n\"is then so great, that he preferred running away to us again, to\r\nremaining with his own people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Incredible as it may seem,\" answered Arthur, \"I am convinced that his\r\nfears are not without foundation, and I even believe that this man\r\nintended to take his life, and would have done so, had we not escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Incredible, indeed!\" exclaimed Browne, \"and what could be the motive\r\nfor so atrocious a crime?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know of none that seems sufficient to account for it fully, and I am\r\ntherefore almost forced to regard the man as a monomaniac.\"\r\n\r\nArthur thought that Atollo had probably made some further desperate\r\nattempt against his brother at Tewa, and, having failed in it, had fled\r\nhither with a part of his followers, among whom some quarrel had since\r\narisen, in the prosecution of which they had been engaged, when we\r\nwitnessed the flight and pursuit along the shore.  This, however, was\r\nmere conjecture: they had talked but little in his presence, and he had\r\nnot been able to learn any thing from the conversation which he had\r\noverheard, as to the cause of their coming hither.  Eiulo had been\r\nquestioned minutely by them, and from him they had ascertained that\r\nthere were four more of us upon the island.\r\n\r\nMorton inquired of Arthur, whether he apprehended that any serious\r\neffort would be made by the savages to find us, and what kind of\r\ntreatment we should probably receive in case we should fall into their\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\"That search will be made for us,\" answered the latter, \"I have not the\r\nslightest doubt; and I do not think that we can look for any mercy, if\r\nwe fall into their hands, since to-day's affray and escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"This feud among themselves,\" said Browne, \"may keep them so busy as to\r\nafford no leisure for troubling themselves about us.  I have some hope\r\nthat they will use those ugly-looking clubs upon one another, to such\r\npurpose, as to rid us of them altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"That old giant,\" said Max, \"who ran away, with such an awkward air, as\r\nif he wasn't at all used to it, will certainly do some mischief if they\r\nonce come to blows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" pursued Browne, \"though he didn't look quite so wicked and like a\r\nwarlock, as the gaunt, wild-eyed heathen that led the chase, I will\r\nwarrant him his full match in fair and equal fight, man to man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Arthur, who during the latter part of this conversation had\r\nbeen apparently engaged in serious and perplexed thought, \"for to-night,\r\nat least, we are in no danger.  Let us now take our necessary rest, and\r\nto-morrow we shall be fresher and better prepared to decide upon the\r\ncourse of action to be adopted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE SINGLE COMBAT.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE--A DEMAND AND REFUSAL--THE TWO CHAMPIONS.\r\n\r\n  \"On many a bloody field before--\r\n  Man of the dark and evil heart!--\r\n  We've met--pledged enemies of yore,\r\n  But now we meet no more to part--\r\n  Till to my gracious liege and lord,\r\n  By thee of broad domains bereft,\r\n  From thy red hand and plotting brain,\r\n  No fear of future wrong is left.\"\r\n\r\nThe sense of surrounding danger with which we laid down that night upon\r\nour beds of fern beneath the Aoa, continued to press darkly upon our\r\nminds even in sleep, and awake us at an early hour to confront anew, the\r\nperplexities and terrors of our situation.\r\n\r\nArthur, in whose better understanding of the habits and character of the\r\nsavages we confided, far from affording us any additional encouragement,\r\nspoke in a manner calculated to overthrow the very hopes, upon which we\r\nhad been resting.\r\n\r\nWe had supposed that they could have no motive but the desire of\r\nrevenge, for seeking or molesting us, and as none of their number had\r\nbeen killed, or in all probability even dangerously injured in the\r\nrencontre with us, we trusted that this motive would not prove strong\r\nenough to incite them to any earnest or long-continued search.  But\r\nArthur hinted at another object, more controlling in the mind of their\r\nstrange leader than any desire to prosecute a petty revenge, which would\r\nimpel him to seek for and pursue us, for the purpose of getting Eiulo\r\nagain into his power.  This enmity--so fixed and implacable--against a\r\nmere child, seemed incredible, even after all that had been said or\r\nsuggested in explanation of it, and the explanations themselves were\r\nfar-fetched, and almost destitute of plausibility.\r\n\r\nAnd how could we hope to escape a pursuit so determined and persevering\r\nas Arthur anticipated?  Whither could we flee for safety?  To think of\r\nsuccessful resistance to Atollo and his band, if discovered by them,\r\nseemed idle.  Max suggested Palm-Islet as the most secure retreat with\r\nwhich we were acquainted.  But Arthur now broached a more startling\r\nplan.  \"Nowhere upon this island,\" said he, \"can we longer consider\r\nourselves secure.  The only step that holds out any prospect of safety\r\nis to leave it in the yawl, and sail for Tewa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any certainty,\" said Browne, \"that we can find it?  Do we even\r\nknow positively where, or in what direction from this place it is; and\r\nshall we not incur the risk of getting lost again at sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather take that risk,\" said Max, \"than remain here, within\r\nreach of these savages--any thing is preferable to falling into their\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess,\" said Arthur, \"that we know nothing certainly in regard to\r\nthe distance, or even the direction of Tewa, but I think we have good\r\nreason to believe that it lies about forty or fifty miles to the\r\nnorthward.\"\r\n\r\nWe could not, however, bring ourselves thus suddenly to adopt a\r\nresolution so momentous, and it was at last tacitly decided to continue\r\nfor the present, at least, at the islet.\r\n\r\n\"If we are to remain here,\" said Arthur, on perceiving that there was no\r\ndisposition to act immediately upon any of the suggestions which had\r\nbeen made, \"let us make such preparation as we can, to defend ourselves\r\nif it shall be necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThis surprised us all; it seemed worse than useless to think of forcible\r\nresistance to a party as numerous as that of Atollo; coming from Arthur\r\nsuch a suggestion was to me doubly surprising.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said he, \"that the notion of attempting to defend ourselves, if\r\ndiscovered, seems to you a desperate one--but I believe it to be our\r\nonly course--we can expect no mercy from Atollo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" said Morton, \"they can have no sufficient motive for murdering\r\nus in cold blood.  But, fresh from another conflict with them, we could\r\nnot perhaps look for forbearance, if in their power.  Against _us_ they\r\ncannot now, it seems to me, cherish any feelings so vindictive as you\r\nimply.\"\r\n\r\n\"And suppose it to be so?  Suppose that they merely aim at Eiulo's life,\r\nwithout wishing to molest us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't fear that I shall be misunderstood, if I speak plainly,\"\r\nanswered Morton, after a pause.  \"It seems, from what you have\r\nintimated, that for some reason they wish to get Eiulo into their hands;\r\nthey are his own people, and their leader is his own uncle; have we any\r\nright to refuse him to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Morton!\" interposed Browne, warmly, \"what cold-blooded doctrine is\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have patience, a minute, and hear me out--I cannot bring myself to\r\nbelieve that they actually intend him harm; I think there must be some\r\nmistake or misapprehension in regard to this alleged design against his\r\nlife, utterly improbable as it is in itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Arthur understands all that, far better than you or I,\" interrupted\r\nBrowne, once more, \"and it is clear that the poor child stands in mortal\r\ndread of this man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was going to add,\" resumed Morton, \"that even if this danger does\r\nexist, it is entirely out of our power to afford him protection against\r\nit: we should merely throw away our lives, in a desperate and\r\nunprofitable attempt.  It may seem unfeeling to talk of giving him up;\r\nbut will not these people be far more likely to act with cruelty, both\r\ntowards him and us, after being excited and enraged by a fruitless\r\nopposition?  I have spoken frankly: but whatever is soberly determined\r\nupon, however unwise in my view, I will abide by.\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit,\" answered Arthur, \"that there is little prospect of success in\r\na conflict with them: but I regard our fate as certain if we submit, and\r\nwe can but be slain in resisting.  I am so fully satisfied of Atollo's\r\ndesigns in respect to him, that I should feel in giving him up, as if I\r\nwere an accessary to his murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us rather defend ourselves to the very last extremity,\" said\r\nBrowne, earnestly, \"if we are so unfortunate as to be found.\"\r\n\r\n\"If,\" said Max, with an excited air,--\"if I really believed they would\r\nkill Eiulo, I should say, never give him up, whatever the consequences\r\nmay be;--and I do think this Atollo must be an incarnate fiend.  I don't\r\nbelieve it will make any difference in their treatment of us whether we\r\nresist or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"O no!\" cried Johnny, who had been listening eagerly to this\r\nconversation, while Eiulo stood looking wistfully on, as if he knew that\r\nit concerned him.  \"O no! don't give him up to that wicked man.  I would\r\nfight, myself, if I had my bow and arrows, but they took them away from\r\nme: can't we hide ourselves in the banyan tree?--they never will think\r\nof looking for us there?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not a bad suggestion,\" said Morton, \"and if we should be\r\ndiscovered, it is a strong place to defend.  We can move easily and\r\nquickly about on that strong horizontal framework of branches, and it\r\nwill be a hazardous undertaking to climb those straight smooth trunks,\r\nin our faces.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed, in fact, as if a party stationed upon the roof, (as it might\r\nbe termed), of this singular tree, would occupy a vantage-ground from\r\nwhich it would require strong odds to dislodge them, and the assailants,\r\nunless provided with fire-arms, or missile weapons, would labour under\r\nalmost insurmountable difficulties.\r\n\r\nArthur discovered a place where it was easy to climb quickly into the\r\ntree, and requested us all to note it particularly, in order that we\r\nmight effect a retreat without loss of time, if it should become\r\nnecessary.  Johnny and Eiulo were to take refuge there at the first\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nBrowne proceeded to cut a number of bludgeons from stout saplings, which\r\nhe then deposited in different places among the branches, ready to be\r\nused, in defending ourselves, if pursued thither.  Max collected a\r\nquantity of large stones, and fragments of rock, along the shore, and\r\nfrom the bed of the brook, and wrapping them in parcels of leaves, he\r\nhoisted them into the roof of the grove-tree, and secured them there.\r\n\r\nMorton surveyed these preparations with a grave smile, and none of us, I\r\nthink, placed much reliance on their efficacy.  We trusted that there\r\nwould be no occasion to resort to them.\r\n\r\nThe supply of provisions which we had brought with us was exhausted, but\r\nthe painful suspense, and constant apprehension incident to our present\r\ncircumstances, long prevented any thought of hunger.  It was not until\r\nthe day had passed without any alarm, and it was beginning to grow dark,\r\nthat we experienced any inclination to eat.  Arthur and I then went in\r\nsearch of food, but could obtain none, except a quantity of pandanus\r\ncones which we gathered from a group of trees near the waterfall.  The\r\nkernels of these were the only food that any of us tasted that day.\r\n\r\nAt night, it was deemed best to keep a watch, in order to guard against\r\nany surprise.  As we made our arrangements for this purpose, my thoughts\r\nreverted to the time of our sufferings at sea in the boat.  But in our\r\npresent position, sought and pursued by malignant human beings, bent\r\nupon taking our lives, and who might at that moment be prowling near,\r\nthere was something more fearful than any peril from the elements, or\r\neven the dread of starvation itself.\r\n\r\nBut the night passed without disturbance or alarm of any kind, and in\r\nthe morning we began to indulge the hope that Arthur had overrated the\r\nstrength of the feelings by which Atollo was actuated, and to shake off\r\nin some degree the profound depression of the preceding evening.\r\n\r\nWith the abatement of our fears and the partial return of tranquillity\r\nof mind, we became more sensible to the demands of hunger.  Max and\r\nMorton ventured a little way into the adjoining forest in search of\r\nbirds, and returned in less than half an hour with about a dozen\r\npigeons, which they had knocked down with sticks and stones.  Arthur had\r\nin the meantime caught quite a string of the yellow fish which had so\r\nperseveringly rejected all Max's overtures a couple of days since.\r\nMorton then kindled a fire to cook our food, though we felt some\r\nhesitation about this, being aware that the smoke might betray us to the\r\nsavages, if they should happen to be at the time in the neighbourhood.\r\nBut Max declared that falling into their hands was a fate preferable to\r\nstarvation, and that rather than eat raw fish and birds, he would incur\r\nthe risk of discovery by means of the fire.  In the absence of cooking\r\nutensils, we hastily scooped out a Polynesian oven, and covered the\r\nbottom with a layer of heated stones, upon which the food, carefully\r\nwrapped in leaves, was deposited: another layer of hot stones was placed\r\non top, and the whole then covered with fresh leaves and earth.  This is\r\nthe method adopted by the natives for baking bread-fruit and fish, and\r\nwith the exception of the trouble and delay involved, it is equal to any\r\nthing that civilised ingenuity has devised for similar purposes, from\r\nthe old-fashioned Dutch-oven to the most recent style of \"improved\r\nkitchen ranges\", with which I am acquainted.  The heat being equally\r\ndiffused throughout the entire mass, and prevented from escaping by the\r\nwrapping of leaves and earth, the subject operated upon, whether fish,\r\nfowl, or vegetable, is thoroughly and uniformly cooked.\r\n\r\nMax had just opened the oven, and was busily engaged in taking out and\r\ndistributing the contents, while the rest of us were gathered in a group\r\naround the spot, when Eiulo suddenly uttered a shrill cry, and springing\r\nup, stood gazing towards the west side of the brook, as if paralysed by\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nLooking up, we saw two natives standing at the edge of the wood quietly\r\nwatching us.  One of them I at once recognised as the lithe and active\r\nleader, whom I had seen upon the shore in swift pursuit of the\r\nfugitives.\r\n\r\nOur first impulse, was to spring at once into the Aoa, according to the\r\nunderstanding to which we had partially come, as to what we were to do\r\nif discovered.  But a second glance showed that there were but two\r\nenemies in sight, and as Arthur, to whom we looked for an example, gave\r\nno signal for such a retreat, we hastily snatched up our weapons, and\r\nplaced ourselves beside him.\r\n\r\nAtollo's quick eye--for it was he--ran from one to another of us, until\r\nit rested upon Eiulo, when coming down to the margin of the brook, he\r\npronounced his name in a low, clear voice, and beckoned him with his\r\nhand to come over to him.\r\n\r\nPale and trembling, like a bird under the charm of the serpent, Eiulo\r\nmade two or three uncertain steps towards him, as if about mechanically\r\nto obey the summons: then, as Johnny seized the skirt of his wrapper,\r\nand called out to him, \"not to mind that wicked man,\" he paused, and\r\nlooked round upon us with a glance, half appealing, half inquiring,\r\nwhich said more plainly than words--\"Must I go?--Can you protect me--and\r\nwill you?\"\r\n\r\nArthur now stepped before him, and addressed some words to Atollo in his\r\nown language, the purport of which I could only guess.\r\n\r\nThe other listened attentively without evincing any surprise, and then\r\nmade answer, speaking rapidly and by jerks as it were, and scanning us\r\nall the while with the eye of a hawk.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, Arthur turned to us.  \"This man requires us, he\r\nsaid, to give up Eiulo to him; he claims him as his brother's son, and\r\nsays that he wishes to convey him home to Tewa.  He promises to leave us\r\nunmolested if we comply, and threatens us with death if we refuse: you\r\nsee it concerns us all--what do you say?\"\r\n\r\nArthur was very pale.  He looked towards Morton, who said nothing, but\r\nstood leaning against one of the pillars of the Aoa, with his eyes\r\nsteadfastly bent upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Eiulo,\" said Browne, \"if this man is his uncle.\"\r\n\r\nThe question was accordingly put, and the trembling boy answered\r\nhesitatingly, that he did not know--but he believed that he was.\r\n\r\n\"Ask him,\" pursued Browne, \"if he is willing to go with him.\"\r\n\r\nArthur put the question formally, and Eiulo, grasping his arm, while\r\nJohnny still held fast by his skirt, answered with a shudder that he was\r\nafraid to go with him.\r\n\r\n\"Ask him why he is afraid,\" continued Browne.\r\n\r\nThe answer was, that he believed his uncle would kill him.\r\n\r\nThese questions were put loud enough to be easily heard by Atollo, and\r\nArthur deliberately repeated the answers first in Tahitian, and then in\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Browne, \"I am now quite ready with an answer, as far as I\r\nam concerned.  I never will consent to give up the poor boy to be\r\nmurdered.  He is old enough to choose for himself and I think it would\r\nbe right to resist the claim even of a father, under such\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that to be our answer?\" said Arthur, looking round.\r\n\r\nIt was a bold stand to take, situated as we were, and we felt it to be\r\nso; but it seemed a hard and cruel thing to yield up our little\r\ncompanion to the tender mercies of his unnatural relative.  Though there\r\nwere pale cheeks and unsteady hands among us, as we signified our\r\nconcurrence in this refusal, (which we all did except Morton, who\r\nremained silent), yet we experienced a strange sense of relief when it\r\nwas done, and we stood committed to the result.\r\n\r\nArthur now motioned Johnny and Eiulo to climb into the tree, then\r\nturning to Atollo, he said that as the boy preferred remaining with us,\r\nwe were resolved to protect him to the extent of our ability.\r\n\r\nBy this time we had somewhat regained our self-possession, and stood\r\ngrasping our weapons, though not anticipating any immediate attack.\r\nMuch to my surprise, Atollo had during the conference manifested neither\r\nanger nor impatience.  When Arthur announced our refusal to comply with\r\nhis demand, he merely noticed with a smile our belligerent attitude, and\r\nadvanced into the brook as if about to come over to the islet, swinging\r\na long curving weapon carelessly by his side, and followed by the other\r\nsavage.\r\n\r\nBrowne, holding his club in his left hand, and a heavy stone in his\r\nright, stood beside me, breathing hard through his set teeth.\r\n\r\n\"The foolish heathen!\" exclaimed he, \"does he expect to subdue us by his\r\nlooks,--that he comes on in this fashion?\"\r\n\r\nIt did, in fact, seem as though he supposed that we would not dare to\r\ncommence an attack upon him, for he continued to advance, eyeing us\r\nsteadily.  Just as he gained the middle of the brook, three or four more\r\nsavages came out of the forest, and one of them ran towards him, with an\r\nexclamation which caused him to turn at once, and on hearing what the\r\nother eagerly uttered, with gestures indicating some intelligence of an\r\nurgent and exciting character, he walked back to the edge of the wood,\r\nand joined the group gathered there.\r\n\r\nA moment afterwards, Atollo, attended by the messenger, as he appeared\r\nto be, plunged into the forest, first giving to the others, who remained\r\nupon the shore, some direction, which from the accompanying gesture,\r\nappeared to have reference to ourselves.\r\n\r\nJohnny and Eiulo had already climbed into the Aoa, whither we stood\r\nready to follow, at a moment's notice.  The group of savages opposite us\r\nseemed to have no other object in view than to prevent our escape, for\r\nthey did not offer to molest us.  Soon after Atollo disappeared, two\r\nmore of his party came out of the wood, and I immediately recognised one\r\nof them, who walked stiffly and with difficulty, seeming but just able\r\nto drag himself about, as the scarred savage with whom Browne had had so\r\ndesperate a struggle.  We now thought it prudent to effect our retreat\r\ninto the tree without further loss of time, but at the first movement\r\nwhich we made for that purpose, the natives set up a shout, and dashed\r\ninto the water towards us, probably thinking that we were about to try\r\nto escape by getting to the further shore.\r\n\r\nThey pressed us so closely that we had not a moment to spare, and had\r\nbarely climbed beyond their reach when they sprang after us.  One active\r\nfellow caught Browne, (who was somewhat behind the rest), by the foot,\r\nand endeavoured to drag him from the trunk he was climbing, in which he\r\nwould probably have succeeded, had not Max let fall a leaf-basket of\r\nstones directly upon his head, which stretched him groaning upon the\r\nground, with the blood gushing from his mouth and nose.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Atollo himself, with the rest of his party, joined our\r\nbesiegers below, and at a signal from him, the greater part of them\r\nimmediately commenced scaling the tree at different points.  Our\r\nassailants numbered not more than thirteen or fourteen, including\r\nBrowne's former foe, who did not seem to be in a condition to climb, and\r\nthe man recently wounded, who was still lying upon the ground,\r\napparently lifeless.  We felt that we were now irrevocably committed to\r\na struggle of life and death, and we were fully determined to fight\r\nmanfully, and to the very last.  We stationed ourselves at nearly equal\r\ndistances among the branches, armed with the bludgeons previously placed\r\nthere, so as to be able to hasten to any point assailed, and to assist\r\none another as occasion should require.  The savages yelled and\r\nscreeched hideously, with the hope of intimidating us, but without any\r\neffect, and we kept watching them quietly, and meeting them so promptly\r\nat every point, that they were uniformly obliged to quit their hold and\r\ndrop to the ground before they could effect a lodgment among the\r\nbranches.  Occasionally we addressed a word of encouragement to one\r\nanother, or uttered an exclamation of triumph at the discomfiture of\r\nsome assailant more than ordinarily fierce and resolute.  But with this\r\nexception, we were as quiet as if industriously engaged in some ordinary\r\noccupation.  This lasted for full fifteen minutes, without our enemies\r\nhaving gained the slightest advantage.  Atollo himself had not, thus\r\nfar, taken any part in the attack, except to direct the others.\r\n\r\nAt length, he fixed his eye upon Browne, who stepping about in the top\r\nof the tree with an agility that I should not have expected from him,\r\nand wielding a tremendous club, had been signally successful in\r\nrepelling our assailants.  After watching him a moment, he suddenly\r\ncommenced climbing a large stem near him, with the marvellous rapidity\r\nthat characterised all his movements.  Browne had just tumbled one of\r\nthe savages to the ground howling with pain, from a crushing blow upon\r\nthe wrist, and he now hastened to meet this more formidable foe.  But he\r\nwas too late to prevent him from getting into the tree, and he had\r\nalready gained a footing upon the horizontal branches, when Browne\r\nreached the spot.  Atollo was without any weapon, and this was a\r\ndisadvantage that might have rendered all his strength and address\r\nunavailing, had not the foliage and the lesser branches of the tree,\r\ninterfered with the swing of the long and heavy weapon of his adversary,\r\nand the footing being too insecure to permit it to be used with full\r\neffect.  As Browne steadied himself and drew back for a sweeping blow,\r\nAtollo shook the boughs upon which he stood, so violently, as greatly to\r\nbreak the force of the stroke, which he received upon his arm, and\r\nrushing upon him before he could recover his weapon, he wrested it from\r\nhis grasp, and hurled him to the ground, where he was instantly seized\r\nand secured by those below.\r\n\r\nWhile Atollo, armed with Browne's club, advanced upon Max and Arthur,\r\nwho were nearest him, several of his followers, taking advantage of the\r\ndiversion thus effected, succeeded in ascending also, and in a few\r\nmoments they were making their way towards us from all sides.  Leaving\r\nthem to complete what he had so well begun, Atollo hastened towards the\r\nspot where Johnny and Eiulo were endeavouring to conceal themselves\r\namong the foliage.  Though now outnumbered, and hopeless of success, we\r\ncontinued a desperate resistance.  The ferocity of our adversaries was\r\nexcited to the highest pitch.  There was scarcely one of them who had\r\nnot received some injury in the attack, sufficiently severe to\r\nexasperate, without disabling him.  We had used our clubs with such\r\nvigour and resolution in opposing their attempts at climbing, that every\r\nsecond man at least, had a crushed hand or a bruised head, and all had\r\nreceived more or less hard blows.  Smarting with pain, and exulting in\r\nthe prospect of speedy and ample revenge, they pressed upon us with\r\nyells and cries that showed that there was no mercy for us if taken.\r\nBut even at that trying moment our courage did out fail or falter.  We\r\nstood together near the centre of the tree, where the branches were\r\nstrong and the footing firm.  Only a part of our assailants had weapons,\r\nand, perceiving the utter desperation with which we fought, they drew\r\nback a little distance until clubs could be passed up from below, and\r\nthus afforded us a momentary respite.  But we well knew that it was only\r\nmomentary, and that in their present state of mind, these men would\r\ndispatch us with as little scruple as they would mischievous wild beasts\r\nhunted and brought to bay.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing now remains,\" said Morton, \"but to die courageously: we have\r\ndone every thing else that we could do.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does appear to have come to that at last,\" said Arthur.  \"If I did\r\nunwisely in advising resistance, and perilling your lives as well as my\r\nown, I now ask your forgiveness; on my own account I do not regret it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to forgive,\" answered Morton, \"you did what you\r\nbelieved was right, and if I counselled otherwise, you will do me the\r\njustice to believe that it was because I differed with you in judgment,\r\nand not because I shrunk from the consequences.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never did you the injustice to think otherwise,\" answered Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"If our friends could but know what has become of us,\" said Max,\r\nbrushing away a tear, \"and how we died here, fighting manfully to the\r\nlast, I should feel more entirely resigned; but I cannot bear to think\r\nthat our fate will never be known.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here they come once more,\" said Arthur, as the savages, having now\r\nobtained their weapons, advanced to finish their work, \"and now, may God\r\nhave mercy upon us!\"\r\n\r\nWe all joined devoutly in Arthur's prayer, for we believed that death\r\nwas at hand.  We then grasped our weapons, and stood ready for the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nAt this instant a long and joyous cry from Eiulo reached our ears.  For\r\nseveral minutes he had been eluding the pursuit of Atollo with a\r\nwonderful agility, partly the effect of frantic dread.  Just when it\r\nseemed as though he could no longer escape, he suddenly uttered this\r\ncry, repeating the words, \"Wakatta!  Wakatta!\"--then springing to the\r\nground, he ran towards the brook, but was intercepted and seized by one\r\nof the savages below.\r\n\r\nThere was an immediate answer to Eiulo's cry, in one of the deepest and\r\nmost powerful voices I had ever heard, and which seemed to come from the\r\nwest shore of the stream.  Looking in that direction I saw, and\r\nrecognised at once, the lion-like old man, who had fled along the beach,\r\npursued by Atollo and his party.  Several men, apparently his followers,\r\nstood around him.  He now bounded across the stream, towards the spot\r\nwhere Eiulo was still struggling with his captor, and calling loudly for\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nAtollo instantly sprang to the ground, and flew to the spot; then, with\r\na shrill call, he summoned his men about him.  Eiulo's outcry, and the\r\nanswer which had been made to it, seemed to have produced a startling\r\neffect upon Atollo and his party.  For the moment we appeared to be\r\nentirely forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"This must be Wakatta,\" said Arthur eagerly, \"it can be no other.  There\r\nis hope yet.\"  With a rapid sign for us to follow, he glided down the\r\nnearest trunk, and, darting past Atollo's party, he succeeded in the\r\nmidst of the confusion, in reaching the old man and his band, who stood\r\nupon the shore of the islet.  Morton and I were equally successful.\r\nMax, who came last, was observed, and an effort made to intercept him.\r\nBut dodging one savage, and bursting from the grasp of another, who\r\nseized him by the arm as he was running at full speed, he also joined\r\nus, and we ranged ourselves beside Wakatta and his men.  Browne, Eiulo,\r\nand Johnny, were prisoners.\r\n\r\nIt now seemed as though the conflict was about to be renewed upon more\r\nequal terms.  Our new and unexpected allies numbered seven, including\r\ntheir venerable leader.  On the other hand, our adversaries were but\r\ntwelve, and of these, several showed evident traces of the severe usage\r\nthey had recently received, and were hardly in a condition for a fresh\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of some minutes, during which the two parties stood\r\nconfronting each other, with hostile, but hesitating looks.  Wakatta\r\nthen addressed a few words to Atollo, in the course of which he several\r\ntimes repeated Eiulo's name, pointing towards him at the same time, and\r\nappearing to demand that he should be released.\r\n\r\nThe reply was an unhesitating and decided refusal, as I easily gathered\r\nfrom the look and manner that accompanied it.\r\n\r\nWakatta instantly swung up his club, uttering a deep guttural\r\nexclamation, which seemed to be the signal for attack, for his people\r\nraised their weapons and advanced as if about to rush upon the others.\r\nWe had in the meantime provided ourselves with clubs, a number of which\r\nwere scattered about upon the ground, and we prepared to assist the\r\nparty with whom we had become so strangely associated.\r\n\r\nBut at a word and gesture from Atollo, Wakatta lowered his weapon again,\r\nand the men on both sides paused in their hostile demonstrations, while\r\ntheir leaders once more engaged in conference.\r\n\r\nAtollo now seemed to make some proposition to Wakatta, which was eagerly\r\naccepted by the latter.  Each then spoke briefly to his followers, who\r\nuttered cries of the wildest excitement, and suddenly became silent\r\nagain.  The two next crossed together to the opposite shore, and while\r\nwe stood gazing in a bewildered manner at these proceedings, and\r\nwondering what could be their meaning, the natives also crossed the\r\nbrook, and formed a wide circle around their chiefs, on an open grassy\r\nspace at the edge of the forest.  We still kept with Wakatta's party,\r\nwho arranged themselves in a semicircle behind him.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean!\" inquired Morton of Arthur, \"it looks as though\r\nthey were about to engage in single combat.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is in fact their purpose,\" answered Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"And will that settle the difficulty between these hostile parties?\"\r\nsaid Morton, \"will there not be a general fight after all, whichever\r\nleader is victor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather think not,\" answered Arthur, \"the party whose champion falls,\r\nwill be too much discouraged to renew the fight--they will probably run\r\nat once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then our situation will be no better than before, in case the old\r\nwarrior should prove unfortunate.  Can't you speak to his followers and\r\nget them to stand ready to attack their enemies if their chief falls.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try what I can do,\" answered Arthur, \"and let us be ready to act\r\nwith them.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the two principal parties had completed their preparations for\r\nthe deadly personal combat, in which they were about to engage.  Atollo\r\ntook from one of his followers a long-handled curving weapon, the inner\r\nside of which was lined with a row of sharks' teeth, and then placed\r\nhimself in the middle of the open space, first carefully kicking out of\r\nthe way a number of fallen branches which strewed the ground.  His\r\nmanner was confident, and clearly bespoke an anticipated triumph.\r\n\r\nWakatta was armed with the massive club, set with spikes of iron-wood,\r\nwhich he carried when I first saw him upon the shore.  He advanced\r\ndeliberately towards his adversary, until they stood face to face, and\r\nwithin easy reach of one another's weapons.\r\n\r\nThe men on both sides remained perfectly quiet, eyeing every movement of\r\ntheir respective champions with the intensest interest.  In the\r\nbreathless silence that prevailed, the gentle murmur of the brook\r\nsliding over its pebbly bed, and even the dropping of a withered leaf,\r\ncould be heard distinctly.\r\n\r\nGlancing over to the islet, I saw that Browne, although his hands\r\nappeared to be bound behind him, had rolled himself to the edge of the\r\nbrook, from which he was watching what was going forward.\r\n\r\nEach of the two combatants regarded the other with the air of a man\r\nconscious that he is about to meet a formidable adversary; but in\r\nAtollo's evil eye, there gleamed an assured and almost exulting\r\nconfidence, that increased my anxiety for his aged opponent; his manner,\r\nnevertheless, was cautious and wary, and he did not suffer the slightest\r\nmovement of Wakatta to escape him.\r\n\r\nThey stood opposite each other, neither seeming to be willing to\r\ncommence the conflict, until Wakatta, with an impatient gesture, warned\r\nhis adversary to defend himself, and then swinging up his ponderous club\r\nin both hands, aimed a blow at him, which the other avoided by springing\r\nlightly backwards.\r\n\r\nAnd now the fight commenced in earnest.  Atollo made no attempt to guard\r\nor parry the blows levelled at him--which would indeed have been idle--\r\nbut with astonishing agility and quickness of eye, he sprang aside, or\r\nleaped back, always in time to save himself.  He kept moving around the\r\nold man, provoking his attacks by feints and half-blows, but making no\r\nserious attack himself.  There was a cool, calculating expression upon\r\nhis sharp and cruel countenance, and he did not appear to be half so\r\nearnest or excited as his antagonist.  I saw plainly that the wily\r\nsavage was endeavouring to provoke the other to some careless or\r\nimprudent movement, of which he stood ready to take instant and fatal\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nAt length some such opportunity as he was waiting for, was afforded him.\r\nThe old warrior, growing impatient of this indecisive manoeuvring,\r\nbegan to press his adversary harder, and to follow him up with an\r\napparent determination to bring matters to a speedy issue.  Atollo\r\nretreated before him, until he was driven to the edge of the brook,\r\nwhere he paused, as if resolved to make a stand.  Wakatta now seemed to\r\nthink that he had brought his foe to bay, and whirling round his club,\r\nhe delivered a sweeping blow full at his head with such fury, that when\r\nAtollo avoided it by dropping upon one knee, the momentum of the\r\nponderous weapon swung its owner half round, and before he had time to\r\nrecover himself, his watchful adversary, springing lightly up, brought\r\ndown his keen-edged weapon full upon his grey head, inflicting a ghastly\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nAnd now Atollo's whole demeanour changed: the time for caution and\r\ncoolness was passed; the moment for destroying his disabled foe had\r\ncome.  While his followers set up an exulting yell, he darted forward to\r\nfollow up his advantage: the triumphant ferocity of his look is not to\r\nbe described.  Wakatta was yet staggering from the effect of the blow\r\nupon his head, when he received a second, which slightly gashed his left\r\nshoulder, and glancing from it, laid open his cheek.  But to my\r\nastonishment, the strong old man, cruelly wounded as he was, seemed to\r\nbe neither disabled nor dismayed.  The keen-edged, but light weapon of\r\nAtollo was better calculated to inflict painful wounds than mortal\r\ninjuries.  Either blow, had it been from a weapon like that of Wakatta,\r\nwould have terminated the combat.\r\n\r\nBefore Atollo could follow up his success by a third and decisive\r\nstroke, the old warrior had recovered himself and though bleeding\r\nprofusely, he looked more formidable than ever.  He at once resumed the\r\noffensive, and with such vigour, that the other, with all his surprising\r\nactivity, now found it difficult to elude his rapid but steady attacks.\r\nHe was now thoroughly aroused.  Atollo seemed gradually to become\r\nconfused and distressed, as he was closely followed around the circle\r\nwithout an instant's respite being allowed him.  At last he was forced\r\ninto the stream, where he made a desperate stand, with the manifest\r\ndetermination to conquer or perish there.  But Wakatta rushed headlong\r\nupon him, and holding his club in his right hand, he received upon his\r\nleft arm, without any attempt to avoid it, a blow which Atollo aimed at\r\nhis head: at the same instant he closed, and succeeded in seizing his\r\nadversary by the wrist.  Once in the old man's grasp, he was a mere\r\nchild, and in spite of his tremendous efforts, his other hand was soon\r\nmastered, and he was thrown to the ground.  It was a horrible scene that\r\nfollowed.  I wished that the life of the vanquished man could have been\r\nspared.  But his excited foe had no thought of mercy, and shortening his\r\nclub, he held him fast with one hand, and despatched him at a single\r\nblow with the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE MIGRATION.\r\n\r\nA TEWAN MD--EXCHANGE OF CIVILITIES--MAX'S FAREWELL BREAKFAST--A GLANCE\r\nAT THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n  \"We go from the shores where those blue billows roll,\r\n  But that Isle, and those waters, shall live in my soul.\"\r\n\r\nAs the victor rose to his feet, his followers uttered a fierce yell, and\r\nprecipitated themselves upon the opposite party, which instantly\r\ndispersed and fled.\r\n\r\nWakatta cast a half-remorseful glance at the corpse of his adversary,\r\nand, raising his powerful voice, recalled his men from the pursuit.\r\nThen wading into the brook, he began to wash the gore from his head and\r\nface: one of his people, who from his official air of bustling alacrity,\r\nmust have been a professional character, or at least an amateur surgeon,\r\nexamined the wounds, and dexterously applied an improvised poultice of\r\nchewed leaves to his gashed face, using broad strips of bark for\r\nbandages.\r\n\r\nMeantime Arthur hastened over to the islet, and released our companions\r\nfrom the ligatures of tappa which confined their limbs.  Eiulo was no\r\nsooner freed, than he ran eagerly to Wakatta, who took him in his arms,\r\nand embraced him tenderly.  After a rapid interchange of questions and\r\nreplies, during which they both shed tears, they seemed to be speaking\r\nof ourselves, Eiulo looking frequently towards us, and talking with\r\ngreat animation and earnestness.  They then approached the place where\r\nwe were standing, and Wakatta spoke a few words, pointing alternately\r\nfrom Eiulo to us.  Arthur made some reply, whereupon the old warrior\r\nwent to him, and bending down his gigantic frame gave him a cordial hug;\r\nhis fresh bandaged wounds probably caused him to dispense with the usual\r\nceremony of rubbing faces.\r\n\r\n\"I expect it will be our turn next,\" said Max, with a grimace, \"if so,\r\nobserve how readily I shall adapt myself to savage etiquette, and\r\nimitate my example.\"\r\n\r\nIt proved as he anticipated, for Wakatta, who must have received a\r\nhighly flattering account of us from Eiulo, was not satisfied until he\r\nhad bestowed upon each one of us, Johnny included, similar tokens of his\r\nregard, Max rushing forward, with an air of \"empressement,\" and taking\r\nthe initiative, as he had promised.  The \"surgeon,\" who seemed to think\r\nthat some friendly notice might also be expected from him, in virtue of\r\nhis official character, now advanced with a patronising air, and in his\r\nturn paid us the same civilities, not omitting the rubbing of faces, as\r\nhis chief had done.  Another one of our \"allies,\" as Max called them, a\r\nhuge, good-natured-looking savage, picked up Johnny, very much as one\r\nwould a lap-dog or a pet kitten, and began to chuck him under the chin,\r\nand stroke his hair and cheeks, greatly to the annoyance of the object\r\nof these flattering attentions, who felt his dignity sadly compromised\r\nby such treatment.\r\n\r\nAs soon as these friendly advances were over, Arthur entered into a\r\nconversation with Wakatta, which, from the earnest expression of the\r\ncountenance of the latter, appeared to relate to something of great\r\ninterest.  Presently he spoke to his men, who seized their weapons with\r\nan air of alacrity, as if preparing for some instant expedition, and\r\nArthur, turning to us, said that we must set out in a body for the inlet\r\nwhere we had seen the canoe of the other party, as it was thought of the\r\nutmost importance to secure it if possible.  We started at once, at a\r\nrapid rate, Wakatta leading the way, with tremendous strides, and the\r\nbig, good-natured fellow, taking Johnny upon his back, in spite of his\r\nprotestations that he could run himself, quite as fast as was necessary.\r\nBut on reaching the inlet we found that the other party had been too\r\nquick for us; they were already through the surf, and under sail,\r\ncoasting along towards the opening in the reef opposite Palm-Islet,\r\nprobably with the intention of returning to Tewa.\r\n\r\nIt is now eight days since the events last narrated took place.  On the\r\nday succeeding, we buried Atollo on the shore opposite Banyan islet,\r\ntogether with one of his followers, who had also been killed or mortally\r\nwounded in the conflict with us.  Two others of them, who were too badly\r\nhurt to accompany the hasty flight to the inlet, are still living in the\r\nwoods, Wakatta having strictly forbidden his people to injure them.\r\n\r\nI ought here to explain the circumstances, as Arthur learned them from\r\nWakatta, which brought the natives to our island.  A civil war had\r\nrecently broken out in Tewa, growing out of the plots of the Frenchmen\r\nresident there, and some discontented chiefs who made common cause with\r\nthem.  One of the foreigners, connected by marriage with the family of a\r\npowerful chief, had been subjected by the authority of Eiulo's father,\r\nto a summary and severe punishment, for an outrage of which he had been\r\nclearly convicted.  This was the immediate cause of the outbreak.\r\nAtollo and his followers had issued from their fastnesses and joined the\r\ninsurgents; a severe and bloody battle had been fought, in which they\r\nwere completely successful, taking the chief himself prisoner, and\r\ndispersing his adherents.\r\n\r\nWakatta, attended by the six followers now with him, was at this time\r\nabsent upon an excursion to a distant part of the island, and the first\r\nintelligence which he received of what had taken place, was accompanied\r\nby the notice that Atollo, with a formidable band, was then in eager\r\nsearch of him.  Knowing well the relentless hatred borne him by that\r\nstrange and desperate man, and that Tewa could furnish no lurking-place\r\nwhere he would be long secure from his indefatigable pursuit, he had\r\nhastily embarked for the island where he had once before taken refuge,\r\nunder somewhat similar circumstances.  Hither his implacable foe had\r\npursued him.  This statement will sufficiently explain what has been\r\nalready related.\r\n\r\nAll our plans are yet uncertain.  Wakatta meditates a secret return to\r\nTewa, confident that by his presence there, now that the formidable\r\nAtollo is no more, he can restore his chief to liberty and to his\r\nhereditary rights, if he yet survives.\r\n\r\nAn experiment has been made with the yawl, in order to ascertain whether\r\nshe can safely convey our entire party, savage and civilised, in case we\r\nshould conclude to leave the island.  The result showed that it would\r\nscarcely be prudent for so great a number to embark in her upon a voyage\r\nto Tewa, and Wakatta and his people have now commenced building a canoe,\r\nwhich is to be of sufficient size to carry twenty persons.\r\n\r\nBrowne's prejudices against the \"heathen savages,\" have been greatly\r\nsoftened by what he has seen of these natives, and he says that, \"if the\r\nrest of them are equally well-behaved, one might manage to get along\r\nwith them quite comfortably.\"  Max has taken a great fancy to Wakatta,\r\nwhom he emphatically pronounces \"a trump,\" a \"regular brick,\" besides\r\nbestowing upon him a variety of other elegant and original designations,\r\nof the like complimentary character.  This may be owing in part, to the\r\nfact, that the old warrior has promised him a bread-fruit plantation,\r\nand eventually a pretty grand-daughter of his own for a wife, if he will\r\naccompany him to Tewa and settle there.\r\n\r\nAs the preparations of our allies advance towards completion, we are\r\nmore and more reconciled to the thought of embarking with them.  Johnny\r\nhas already commenced packing his shells and \"specimens\" for removal.\r\nMax has ascertained, greatly to his relief, for he had some doubts on\r\nthe subject, that the gridiron and other cooking utensils can be stowed\r\nsafely in the locker of the yawl, and he anticipates much benevolent\r\ngratification in introducing these civilised \"institutions,\" among the\r\nbarbarians of Tewa.\r\n\r\nThe intestine feuds which still rage there, and the probability that\r\n\"our side,\" will find themselves in the minority, furnish the chief\r\ngrounds of objection to the step contemplated.  But we would cheerfully\r\nincur almost any danger that promises to increase our prospect of\r\nultimately reaching home.\r\n\r\nThere is some talk of a preliminary reconnoitring expedition, by Wakatta\r\nand two or three of his people, for the purpose of getting some definite\r\ninformation as to the present position of affairs at Tewa, before\r\nsetting out for it in a body.  Max, yesterday, finished his miniature\r\nship, and exhorted me to \"wind up\" our history forthwith, with a Homeric\r\ndescription of the great battle at the islet, and our heroic defence of\r\nthe banyan tree.  He declares it to be his intention to enclose the\r\nmanuscript in the hold of the vessel and launch her when half-way to\r\nTewa, in the assured confidence that the winds and waves will waft it to\r\nits destination, or to use his own phrase,--\"that we shall yet be heard\r\nof in Hardscrabble.\"\r\n\r\nFive days ago, the canoe was completed, and on the succeeding afternoon,\r\nWakatta, accompanied by \"the doctor,\" and two other of his people,\r\nsailed for Tewa, for the purpose of endeavouring to learn whether it\r\nwould be prudent for us to venture thither at present.\r\n\r\nWe have been living of late at the cabin, and our \"allies\" have made an\r\nencampment by the lake, within a hundred paces of us.  The state of\r\nfeverish expectation naturally produced by our present circumstances,\r\nprevents any thing like regular occupation.  We do nothing all the day\r\nbut wander restlessly about among the old haunts which were our\r\nfavourites in the peaceful time of our early sojourn here.  Max has\r\nendeavoured to relieve the tedium, and get up an interest of some sort,\r\nby renewing his attempts against the great eel.  But the patriarch is as\r\nwary, and his stronghold beneath the roots of the buttress tree as\r\nimpregnable as ever, and all efforts to his prejudice, whether by force\r\nor stratagem, still prove unavailing.  To escape, in some measure, the\r\nhumiliation of so mortifying a defeat, Max now affects to be convinced\r\nthat his venerable antagonist is no eel after all, but an old\r\nwater-snake, inheriting his full share of the ancient wisdom of the\r\nserpent, and by whom it is consequently no disgrace for any mortal man\r\nto be outwitted.\r\n\r\nFor several days past we have even neglected preparing any regular\r\nmeals, satisfying our hunger as it arose with whatever could be most\r\nreadily procured.\r\n\r\nMax pronounces this last, \"an alarming indication of the state of utter\r\ndemoralisation towards which we are hastening, and, in fact, the\r\ncommencement of a relapse into barbarism.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the chief points of difference,\" he says, \"between civilised and\r\nsavage man, is, that the former eats at stated and regular intervals, as\r\na matter of social duty, whereas the latter only eats when he is\r\nhungry!\"\r\n\r\n_Two days later_.  Wakatta has returned from his expedition, full of\r\nhope and confidence, and actually looking ten years younger than when I\r\nfirst saw him.  He says that the position of affairs at Tewa is most\r\npromising.  The recently victorious rebels have fallen into fierce\r\ncontentions among themselves, and a large faction of them, with the\r\nleaders of which he has entered into communication, is willing to unite\r\nwith him against the others, upon being assured of indemnity for past\r\noffences.  Eiulo's father still lives, and has already gathered the\r\nnucleus of a force capable of retrieving his fortunes.\r\n\r\nAll is now finally determined upon, and we only wait for a favourable\r\nbreeze to bid adieu to these shores.\r\n\r\nThe morning of Wakatta's return, also witnessed another event of nearly\r\nequal importance.  I allude to a great farewell breakfast, given by Max\r\nin celebration of our approaching departure, as well as for the purpose\r\nof stemming the current of the demoralising influence above alluded to.\r\nThe \"founder of the feast,\" together with Eiulo and Johnny, was up\r\npreparing it with his own hospitable hands, a full hour before the rest\r\nof us were awake.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of all the delicacies and luxuries that our island can\r\nafford: there were roasted oysters fresh from the shore, and poached\r\neggs fresh from the nest, (Max had despatched one of the natives to\r\nSea-birds' Point after them before daylight); then there were fish\r\nnicely broiled, and mealy taro, and baked bread-fruit hot from a\r\nsubterranean Polynesian oven.\r\n\r\nIn the enjoyment of this generous fare, our drooping spirits rose, and\r\nMax, as was his wont, became discursive.\r\n\r\n\"What a humiliating reflection,\" exclaimed he, \"that we should have\r\npermitted ourselves to be so disturbed and fluttered, by the prospect of\r\na slight change in our affairs!  Why should we distrust our destiny, or\r\nshrink from our mission?  Why these nervous apprehensions, and these\r\nunreasonable doubts?\"--(Hear! hear!)\r\n\r\n  \"`There _is_ a providence that shapes our ends,\r\n  Rough-hew them how we will.'\r\n\r\n\"Let us accept, then, the belief which all things tend to confirm, that\r\na glorious future awaits us in our new sphere of action at Tewa!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" sighed Browne, after a momentary pause, \"Tewa may be a fine\r\nplace--but I doubt if they have any such oysters as these there.\"  The\r\naction accompanying these words must have given Eiulo a clue to their\r\npurport, for he hastened eagerly to protest, through Arthur, as\r\ninterpreter, that the oysters at Tewa were much larger and fatter; he\r\nadded, \"that since we liked them so much, he would have them all\r\n`tabooed,' as soon as we arrived, so that `common people,' wouldn't dare\r\nfor their lives to touch one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I used to regard the `taboo,'\" said Browne, \"as an arbitrary and\r\noppressive heathen custom.  But how ignorant and prejudiced we sometimes\r\nare in regard to foreign institutions!  We must be very careful when we\r\nget there about introducing rash innovations upon the settled order of\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will establish an enlightened system of common schools,\" said Max,\r\n\"to begin with, and Arthur shall also open a Sunday-school.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in the course of time we will found a college, in which Browne\r\nshall be professor of Elocution and Oratory,\" said Morton.\r\n\r\n\"And you,\" resumed Max, \"shall have a commission as Major-General in the\r\nRepublican army of Tewa, which you shall instruct in modern tactics, and\r\nlead to victory against the rebels.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Royal army, if you please,\" interrupted Browne; \"Republicanism\r\nis one of those crude and pestilent innovations which I shall set my\r\nface against!  Can any one breathe so treasonable a suggestion in the\r\npresence of the heir-apparent to the throne?--If such there be,\r\nMajor-General Morton, I call upon you to attach him for a traitor!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" cried Johnny, \"what shall I do!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" answered Max, \"you shall rejoice the hearts of the Tewan\r\njuveniles, by introducing among them the precious lore of the\r\nstory-books.  The rising generation shall no longer remain in heathen\r\nignorance of Cinderella, and Jack of the Bean-stalk, and his still more\r\nillustrious cousin, the Giant-killer!  The sufferings of Sinbad, the\r\nvoyages of Gulliver, the achievements of Munchausen, the adventures of\r\nCrusoe, shall yet become to them familiar as household words!\"\r\n\r\n\"And Archer's mission shall be no less dignified and useful,\" resumed\r\nBrowne, \"he shall keep the records of the monarchy, and become the\r\nfaithful historian of the happy, prosperous, and glorious reign of Eiulo\r\nthe First!\"\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
