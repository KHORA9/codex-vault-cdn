Horsford, from whose address the\r\nfollowing passages are extracted:\r\n\r\n    \"What is the great fact that is sustained by such an array of\r\n    authority? It is this: that somewhere to the southwest of\r\n    Greenland, at least a fortnight's sail, there were, for 300\r\n    years after the beginning of the 11th century, Norse colonies on\r\n    the coast of America, with which colonies the home country\r\n    maintained commercial intercourse. The country to which the\r\n    merchant vessels sailed was Vinland.\r\n\r\n    \"The fact next in importance that this history establishes is,\r\n    that the first of the Northmen to set foot on the shores of\r\n    Vinland was Leif Ericson. The story is a simple one, and most\r\n    happily told by Prof. Mitchell, who for forty years was\r\n    connected with the coast survey of the United States in the\r\n    latitudes which include the region between Hatteras and Cape\r\n    Ann. Leif, says Prof. Mitchell, never passed to the south of the\r\n    peninsula of Cape Cod. He was succeeded by Thorwald, Leif's\r\n    brother. He came in Leif's ship in 1002 to Leif's headquarters\r\n    in Massachusetts Bay and passed the winter. In the spring, he\r\n    manned his ship and sailed eastward from Leif's house, and,\r\n    unluckily running against a neck of land, broke the stem of the\r\n    ship. He grounded the ship in high water at a place where the\r\n    tide receded with the ebb to a great distance, and permitted the\r\n    men to careen her in the intervals of the tide, to repair her.\r\n    When she was ready to sail again, the old stem or nose of the\r\n    ship was set up in the sand. Thorwald remained a couple of years\r\n    in the neighboring bay, examining sandy shores and islands, but\r\n    not going around the point on or near which he had set up his\r\n    ship's nose. In a battle with the Indians he was wounded and\r\n    died, and was buried in Vinland, and his crew returned to\r\n    Greenland. A few years later, Thorfinn and his wife, Gudrid, set\r\n    out with a fleet of three ships and 160 persons, of whom seven\r\n    were women, to go to Vinland, and in two days' sail beyond\r\n    Markland they came to the ship's nose set upon the shore, and,\r\n    keeping that upon the starboard, they sailed along a sandy\r\n    shore, which they called Wunderstrandir, and also\r\n    Furderstrandir. One of the captains, evidently satisfied that\r\n    they were not in the region visited by Leif and Thorwald, turned\r\n    his vessel to the north to find Vinland. Thorfinn and Gudrid\r\n    went further south and trafficked, and gathered great wealth of\r\n    furs and woods, and then returned to Greenland and Norway.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Horsford refers next to various geographic names on the New\r\nEngland coast which are of Scandinavian origin.\r\n\r\n    \"What do all these names mean? They are certainly not Algonquin\r\n    or Iroquois names. They are not names bestowed by the Plymouth\r\n    or Massachusetts Bay colonies. Of most of them is there any\r\n    conceivable source other than the memories lingering among a\r\n    people whose ancestors were familiar with them? Are they, for\r\n    the most part, relics of names imposed by Northmen once residing\r\n    here?\r\n\r\n    \"I have told you something of the evidence that Leif Ericson was\r\n    the first European to tread the great land southwest of\r\n    Greenland. His ancestry was of the early Pilgrims, or Puritans,\r\n    who, to escape oppression, emigrated, 50,000 of them in sixty\r\n    years, from Norway to Iceland, as the early Pilgrims came to\r\n    Plymouth. They established and maintained a republican form of\r\n    government, which exists to this day, with nominal sovereignty\r\n    in the King of Denmark, and the flag, like our own, bears an\r\n    eagle in its fold. Toward the close of the 10th century a\r\n    colony, of whom Leif's father and family were members, went out\r\n    from Iceland to Greenland. In about 999, Leif, a lad at the time\r\n    of his father's immigration, went to Norway, and King Olaf,\r\n    impressed with his grand elements of character, gave him a\r\n    commission to carry the Christianity to which, he had become a\r\n    convert to Greenland. He set out at once, and, with his soul on\r\n    fire with the grandeur of his message, within a year\r\n    accomplished the conversion and baptism of the whole colony,\r\n    including his father.\r\n\r\n    \"To Leif a monument has been erected. In thus fulfilling the\r\n    duty we owe to the first European navigator who trod our shores,\r\n    we do no injustice to the mighty achievement of the Genoese\r\n    discoverer under the flags of Ferdinand and Isabella, who,\r\n    inspired by the idea of the rotundity of the earth, and with the\r\n    certainty of reaching Asia by sailing westward sufficiently\r\n    long, set out on a new and entirely distinct enterprise, having\r\n    a daring and a conception and an intellectual train of research\r\n    and deduction as its foundation quite his own. How welcome to\r\n    Boston will be the proposition to set up in 1892, a fit statue\r\n    to Columbus.\r\n\r\n    \"We unveil to-day the statue in which Anne Whitney has expressed\r\n    so vividly her conception of this leader, who, almost nine\r\n    centuries ago, first trod our shores.\"\r\n\r\nThe statue, however, is purely fanciful, and gives no idea either of\r\nthe personal appearance or costume of the great sailor, who has waited\r\nfor this justice to his memory much longer than Bruno and many other\r\nheroes of human progress.\r\n\r\nColumbus may have been original in his ideas, but it was the Northmen\r\nwho led in exploration. It was they who changed the old flat-bottomed\r\nships of the Roman Empire to the deep keels which made the exploration\r\nof the Atlantic ocean possible.\r\n\r\nThis act of justice has been prompted by the appreciative sentiments\r\nof the late Ole Bull, and the efforts of Miss Marie Brown, who has\r\nlectured on the subject. Miss Brown says that Columbus learned of the\r\ndiscovery of America at Rome, and also at Iceland, which he visited in\r\n1477. Indeed, Columbus was not seeking the America of the Norsemen,\r\nbut was sailing to find the Indies.\r\n\r\nBut now that historic justice is done, we realize that as Bryant\r\nexpressed it of Truth, \"the eternal years of God are hers,\" and she\r\nneeds a good many centuries to recover her stolen sceptre. The triumph\r\nof truth follows battles in which there are many defeats that seem\r\nalmost fatal. What is the loss of five centuries in geographic truth\r\nto the loss of a thousand years in astronomic science? It was for more\r\nthan a thousand years that the heliocentric theory of the universe,\r\ndeveloped by the genius of PYTHAGORAS, was ignored, denied, and\r\nforgotten, until the honest scholar, COPERNICUS, revived it by a\r\nmathematical demonstration, which he did not live long enough to see\r\ntrampled on; for the great astronomer that next appeared, Tycho Brahe,\r\ndenied it, and the Catholic Church attempted to suppress it in the\r\nperson of Galileo, who is said to have been forced by imprisonment and\r\ntorture to succumb to authority (the torture may not be positively\r\nknown, but is believed with good reason). Even Luther joined in the\r\ntheological warfare against science, saying, \"I am now advised that a\r\nnew astrologer is risen, who presumeth to prove that the earth moveth\r\nand goeth about, not the firmament, the sun and moon--not the\r\nstars--like as when one sitteth on a coach, or in a ship that is\r\nmoved, thinketh he sitteth still and resteth, but the earth and trees\r\ndo move and run themselves. Thus it goeth; we give ourselves up to our\r\nown foolish fancies and conceits. This fool (Copernicus) will turn the\r\nwhole art of astronomy upside down; but the Scripture showeth and\r\nteacheth another lesson, when Joshua commandeth the sun to stand\r\nstill, and not the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Luther in this matter was the attitude of the Church\r\ngenerally, in opposition to science, for it assumed its position in an\r\nage of dense ignorance, and claimed too much infallibility to admit of\r\nenlightenment. Nevertheless, the Church feels the spirit of the age\r\nand slowly moves. At the present time it is being _slowly_ permeated\r\nby the modern spirit of agnostic scepticism, which is another form of\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nMankind generally occupy the intrenched camp of ignorance within which\r\nthey know all its walls embrace; outside of which they look upon all\r\nthat exists with feelings of suspicion and hostility, and alas, this\r\nis as true of the educated as of the uneducated classes. It was the\r\nFrench Academy that laughed at Harvey's discovery and at Fulton's plan\r\nof propelling steamboats, and even at Arago's suggestion of the\r\nelectric telegraph, as the Royal Society laughed at Franklin's\r\nproposed lightning rods. It was Bonaparte who treated both Fulton and\r\nDr. Gall with contempt. It was the medical Faculty that arrayed itself\r\nagainst the introduction of Peruvian bark, which they have since made\r\ntheir hobby; and it was the same Edinburgh Review which poured its\r\nridicule upon Gall, that advised the public to put Thomas Gray in a\r\nstraight-jacket for advocating the introduction of railroads. Equally\r\ngreat was the stupidity of the French. The first railroad was\r\nconstructed in France fifty years ago. Emil Periere had to make the\r\nline at his own expense, and it took three years to obtain the consent\r\nof the authorities. Their leading statesman, Thiers, contended that\r\nrailroads could be nothing more than toys. We remember that a\r\ncommittee of the New York Legislature was equally stupid, and\r\nendeavored to prove in their report that railways were entirely\r\nimpracticable. English opposition was still more stupidly absurd. Both\r\nLords and Commons in Parliament were entirely opposed. \"The engineers\r\nand surveyors as they went about their work were molested by mobs.\r\nGeorge Stephenson was ridiculed and denounced as a maniac, and all\r\nthose who supported him as lunatics and fools.\" \"George Stephenson\r\nalthough bantered and wearied on all sides stood steadfastly by his\r\nproject, in spite of the declarations that the smoke from the engine\r\nwould kill the birds and destroy the cattle along the route, that the\r\nfields would be ruined, and people be driven mad by noise and\r\nexcitement.\"\r\n\r\nNothing is better established in history than the hostility of\r\ncolleges and the professional classes to all great innovations. \"Truly\r\n(says Dr. Stille in his Materia Medica) nearly every medicine has\r\nbecome a popular remedy before being adopted or even tried by\r\nphysicians,\" and the famous author Dr. Pereira declares that \"nux\r\nvomica is one of the few remedies the discovery of which is not the\r\neffect of mere chance.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of bigotry, in former times, jealously watched every\r\ninnovation. Telescopes and microscopes were denounced as atheistic,\r\nwinnowing machines were denounced in Scotland as impious, and even\r\nforks when first introduced were denounced by preachers as \"an insult\r\non Providence not to eat our meat with our fingers.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that the last fifty years have sufficed to cover\r\nwith a cloud of collegiate ignorance and bigotry the discoveries of\r\nthe illustrious Gall, for whom I am doing a similar service, to that\r\nof Copernicus for Pythagoras.\r\n\r\nThis is nothing unusual in the progress of Science. There was no\r\nbrighter genius in physical science at the beginning of this century\r\nthan Dr. Thomas Young, who died in 1829, whose discoveries fell into\r\nobscurity until they were revived by more recent investigation. He had\r\nthat intuitive genius which is most rare among scientists.\r\n\r\nHe was a great thinker and discoverer, who knew how to utilize in\r\nphilosophy discovered facts, and was not busy like many modern\r\nscientists in the monotonous repetition of experiments which had\r\nalready been performed.\r\n\r\n    \"At no period of his life was he fond of repeating experiments\r\n    or even of originating new ones. He considered that however\r\n    necessary to the advancement of science, they demanded a great\r\n    sacrifice of time, and that when a fact was once established,\r\n    time was better employed in considering the purposes to which it\r\n    might be applied, or the principles which it might tend to\r\n    elucidate.\"\r\n\r\nHe says, in his Bakerian lecture, \"Nor is it absolutely necessary in\r\nthis instance to produce a single new experiment; for of experiments\r\nthere is already an ample store.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his sister-in-law, Mrs. Earle, he says, \"Acute\r\nsuggestion was then, and indeed always, more in the line of my\r\nambition than experimental illustration,\" and on another occasion,\r\nreferring to the Wollaston fund for experimental inquiries, he said,\r\n\"For my part, it is my pride and pleasure, as far as I am able, to\r\nsupersede the necessity of experiments, and more especially of\r\nexpensive ones.\" The famous Prof. Helmholtz said of Young:\r\n\r\n    \"The theory of colors with all their marvellous and complicated\r\n    relations, was a riddle which Goethe in vain attempted to solve,\r\n    nor were we physicists and physiologists more successful. I\r\n    include myself in the number, for I long toiled at the task\r\n    without getting any nearer my object, until I at last discovered\r\n    that a wonderfully simple solution had been discovered at the\r\n    beginning of this century, and had been in print ever since for\r\n    any one to read who chose. This solution was found and published\r\n    by the same Thomas Young, who first showed the right method of\r\n    arriving at the interpretation of Egyptian hieroglyphics.\"\r\n\r\n    \"He was one of the most acute men who ever lived, but had the\r\n    misfortune to be _too far in advance of his contemporaries_.\r\n    They looked on him with astonishment, but could not follow his\r\n    bold speculations, and thus a mass of his most important\r\n    thoughts remained buried and forgotten in the 'Transactions of\r\n    the Royal Society,' until a later generation by slow degrees\r\n    arrived at the re-discovery of his discoveries, and came to\r\n    appreciate the force of his argument and the accuracy of his\r\n    conclusions.\"\r\n\r\nThis half century of passive resistance to science, in the case of Dr.\r\nYoung and Dr. Gall, is nothing unusual. It was 286 years from the day\r\nwhen Bruno, the eloquent philosopher, was burned at the stake by the\r\nCatholic Church, before a statue was prepared to honor his memory in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nWhat was the reception of the illustrious surgeon, physiologist, and\r\nphysician, John Hunter? While he lived, \"most of his contemporaries\r\nlooked upon him as little better than an enthusiast and an innovator,\"\r\naccording to his biographer; and when, in 1859, it was decided to\r\ninter his remains in Westminster Abbey, it was hard to find his body,\r\nwhich was at last discovered in a vault along with 2000 others piled\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nHarvey's discoveries were generally ignored during his life, and\r\nMeibomius of Lubeck rejected his discovery in a book published after\r\nHarvey's death.\r\n\r\nWhen Newton's investigations of light and colors were first published,\r\n\"A host of enemies appeared (says Playfair), each eager to obtain the\r\nunfortunate pre-eminence of being the first to attack conclusions\r\nwhich the unanimous voice of posterity was to confirm.\" Some, like\r\nMariotte, professed to repeat his experiments, and succeeded in making\r\na failure, which was published; like certain professors who at\r\ndifferent times have undertaken to make unsuccessful experiments in\r\nmesmerism and spiritualism, and have always succeeded in making the\r\nfailure they desired.\r\n\r\nVoltaire remarks, and Playfair confirms it as a fact, \"that though the\r\nauthor of the _Principia_ survived the publication of that great work\r\nnearly forty years, he had not at the time of his death, twenty\r\nfollowers out of England.\"\r\n\r\nIf educated bigotry could thus resist the mathematical demonstrations\r\nof Newton, and the physical demonstrations of Harvey, has human nature\r\nsufficiently advanced to induce us to expect much better results from\r\nthe colleges of to-day--from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and the rest?\r\nIf such a change has occurred, I have not discovered it.\r\n\r\nNeglect and opposition has ever been the lot of the original explorer\r\nof nature. Kepler, the greatest astronomical genius of his time,\r\ncontinually struggled with poverty, and earned a scanty subsistence by\r\ncasting astrological nativities.\r\n\r\nEustachius, who in the 16th century discovered the Eustachian tube and\r\nthe valves of the heart, was about 200 years in advance of his time,\r\nbut was unable, from poverty, to publish his anatomical tables, which\r\nwere published by Lancisi 140 years later, in 1714.\r\n\r\nNot only in science do we find this stolid indifference or active\r\nhostility to new ideas, but in matters of the simplest character and\r\nmost obvious utility. For example, this country is now enjoying the\r\nbenefits of fish culture, but why did we not enjoy it a hundred years\r\nago? The process was discovered by the Count De Goldstein in the last\r\ncentury, and was published by the Academy of Sciences, and also fully\r\nillustrated by a German named Jacobi, who applied it to breeding trout\r\nand salmon. This seems to have been forgotten until in 1842 two\r\nobscure and illiterate fishermen rediscovered and practised this\r\nprocess. The French government was attracted by the success of these\r\nfisherman, Gehin and Remy, and thus the lost art was revived.\r\n\r\nEven so simple an invention as the percussion cap, invented in 1807,\r\nwas not introduced in the British army until after the lapse of thirty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the kindergarten system, Friedrich FROEBEL, is one of\r\nthe benefactors of humanity. How narrowly did he escape from total\r\nfailure and oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe \"Reminiscences of Frederich Froebel,\" translated from the German\r\nof the late Mrs. Mary Mann, gives an interesting account of his life\r\nand labors, upon which the following notice is based:\r\n\r\n    \"Froebel died in 1852, and it is possible that his system of\r\n    education would have died with him--to be resurrected and\r\n    reapplied by somebody else centuries later--only for a friend\r\n    and interpreter who remained to give his teachings to the world.\r\n    This friend, disciple, and interpreter was Madame Von Marenholz.\r\n    His system of education had this peculiarity which made it\r\n    different from any other plan of teaching ever given to the\r\n    world--it was first grasped in its full significance by women.\r\n    They, sooner than men, saw its truth to nature, and its grand,\r\n    far-reaching meaning, and became at once its enthusiastic\r\n    disciples. But the German women are in a bondage almost unknown\r\n    to their sisters of the other civilized races, therefore\r\n    Froebel's reform progressed only slowly. Had his principles been\r\n    given to the world in the midst of American or English women,\r\n    they would most likely have been popularly known and adopted\r\n    long ago.\r\n\r\n    \"Froebel did not see any very magnificent practical results flow\r\n    from the \"new education\" in his time. While he lived the\r\n    ungrateful tribe of humanity abused, misrepresented, and laughed\r\n    him to scorn, as it has done everybody who ever conferred any\r\n    great and lasting benefit on it. A touching illustration of this\r\n    is given in the anecdote narrating Frau Von Marenholz's first\r\n    meeting with the founder of kindergartens. The anecdote begins\r\n    the book, and it is the key-note of the sorrowful undertone\r\n    throughout.\r\n\r\n    \"In 1849 Frau Von Marenholz went to the baths of Liebenstein.\r\n    She happened to ask her landlady what was going on in the place,\r\n    and in answer the landlady said that a few weeks before a man\r\n    had settled down near the springs who danced and played with the\r\n    village children, and was called by people \"the old fool.\" A few\r\n    days afterwards Madame Von M. was walking out, and met \"the old\r\n    fool.\" He was an old man, with long gray hair, who was marching\r\n    a troop of village children two and two up a hill. He was\r\n    teaching them a play, and was singing with them a song belonging\r\n    to it. There was something about the gray-haired old man, as he\r\n    played with the children, which brought tears into the eyes of\r\n    both Madame Von M. and her companion. She watched him awhile,\r\n    and said to her companion:\r\n\r\n    \"'This man is called 'old fool' by these people. Perhaps he is\r\n    one of those men who are ridiculed or stoned by contemporaries,\r\n    and to whom future generations build monuments.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"I knew,\" says Madame Von M., \"that I had to do with a true\r\n    man--with an original and unfalsified nature. When one of his\r\n    pupils called him Mr. Froebel, I remembered having once heard of\r\n    a man of that name who wished to educate children by play, and\r\n    that it had seemed to me a very perverted view, for I had only\r\n    thought of empty play, without any serious purpose.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Froebel met with violent opposition and ridicule all his life,\r\n    and just when at last he thought he had successfully planted his\r\n    ideas, there came a sudden death-blow to his hopes, which was\r\n    also a death-blow to the good and great man. The Prussian\r\n    Government was and is as tyrannical as William the Conqueror,\r\n    who made the English people put their lights out at dark, and\r\n    suddenly, in August, 1851, the Prussian Government immortalized\r\n    itself by passing a decree forbidding the establishment of any\r\n    kindergartens within the Prussian dominions. In unguarded\r\n    moments, Froebel had used the expression \"education for\r\n    freedom,\" in referring to his beloved plans, and that was enough\r\n    for Prussia, in the ferment of fear in which she has been ever\r\n    since 1848. Kindergartens in Germany have not yet recovered from\r\n    this blow, and Froebel himself sunk under it and died. But a\r\n    little time before he died, he said: \"If 300 years after my\r\n    death, my method of education shall be completely established\r\n    according to its idea, I shall rejoice in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Froebel's life was full of strange vicissitudes and\r\n    disappointments. The few friends who understood him, and the\r\n    children whom he taught, and who, perhaps, understood him better\r\n    than anybody else, reverenced him, and loved him as father,\r\n    prophet, and teacher.\r\n\r\n    \"On his seventieth birthday, two months before his death, his\r\n    beloved pupils gave him a festival, which is beautiful to read\r\n    about. It must have gladdened the pure-hearted old man\r\n    immeasurably. Froebel was wakened at sun-rise by the festal song\r\n    of the children, and as he stepped out of his chamber to the\r\n    lecture-room, he saw that it had been splendidly adorned with\r\n    flowers, festoons, and wreaths of all kinds. The day was\r\n    celebrated with songs and rejoicing, and gifts were received\r\n    from pupils and friends in various parts of the world, and in\r\n    the evening, after a song, a pupil placed a green wreath upon\r\n    the master's head.\r\n\r\n    \"Two months after this he died peacefully. One of his strongest\r\n    peculiarities was his passionate love for flowers, and during\r\n    his illness he repeatedly commended the care of his flowers to\r\n    his friends. He had the window opened frequently, so he could\r\n    gaze once more on the out-door scenes he loved so well. Almost\r\n    his last words were: 'Nature, pure, vigorous Nature!'\"\r\n\r\nJOHN FITCH, the inventor of steamboats, was even less fortunate than\r\nFroebel. No patron took him by the hand, and although his invention\r\nwas successfully demonstrated at Philadelphia in 1787, by a small\r\nsteamboat, the trial being witnessed by the members of the convention\r\nthat formed the Federal constitution, he could not obtain sufficient\r\nco-operation to introduce the invention, and finally left his boat to\r\nrot on the shores of the Hudson and returned to his home at Bardstown,\r\nKy., where he died in 1798. The unsuccessful struggles of Fitch make a\r\nmelancholy history. In his last appeal he used this language: \"But why\r\nthose earnest solicitations to disturb my nightly repose, and fill me\r\nwith the most excruciating anxieties; and why not act the part for\r\nmyself, and retire under the shady elms on the fair banks of the Ohio,\r\nand eat my coarse but sweet bread of industry and content, and when I\r\nhave done, to have my body laid in the soft, warm, and loamy soil of\r\nthe banks, with my name inscribed on a neighboring poplar, that future\r\ngenerations when traversing the mighty waters of the West, _in the\r\nmanner that I have pointed out_, may find my grassy turf.\"\r\n\r\nIN the lives of Pythagoras, Copernicus, Galileo, Ericson, Bruno,\r\nHarvey, Kepler, Newton, Hunter, Gall, Young, Froebel, Gray, Fitch,\r\nStephenson, and _many_ others, we learn that he who assails the\r\nGibraltar of conservative and authoritative ignorance must expect to\r\nconduct a very long siege, to maintain a resolute battle, and perhaps\r\nto die in his camp, leaving to his posterity to receive the\r\npredestined surrender of the citadels of Falsehood and Darkness, for\r\nthe eternal law of the universe declares that all darkness shall\r\ndisappear, and Light and Peace shall cover the earth, as they already\r\nfill the souls of the lovers of wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDERGRADUATE EXPENSES AT HARVARD.--A physician has written me to know\r\nwhat the annual expense is for an undergraduate at Harvard College.\r\nThe inquiry is made that he (the querist) may know somewhere near what\r\nit will cost to send his son to that institution. Thinking that others\r\nof the _Journal's_ readers might like to know what a literary (or\r\nliberal) education costs at a first-class college, I have looked up\r\nthe present cost, and by comparing it with my own, thirty-five years\r\nago, I find that expense has increased from year to year, until now it\r\nrequires about $550 to $600 annually to cover tuition, room-rent,\r\nboard, and common running expenses. A boy might squeeze through for\r\n$400 a year, but he would have to pinch and be niggardly, if not mean.\r\nThe $550 or $600 would not cover vacation expenses and society dues,\r\ntherefore the larger sum ought to be reckoned as the cost annually for\r\na Harvard undergraduate at the present time. And upon inquiry, I find\r\nthat about the same amount of money is required by an undergraduate of\r\nYale. Board in New Haven is the same in price as in Cambridge. For the\r\nfour years' course, then, there should be provision for $2,500. Rich\r\nstudents spend a $1000 or more each year, but they do not embrace ten\r\nper cent. of the classes. The average student when I was in Harvard\r\nexpended $350 to $400 a year--a cost which did not cover vacation\r\nexpenses and society matters. I will venture the remark that as high\r\nan order of scholarship can be obtained at \"Western\" colleges as in\r\nHarvard or Yale; and that the expense of student life would not be\r\ntwo-thirds as much. Why, then, take the extravagant course? The _name_\r\nand _fame_ of an institution count for something. A recently founded\r\ncollege may not live long; it has to be tested by time before\r\n_prestige_ can be attained. Universities have to be endowed before\r\nthey can command the best talent of the world in teachers. The fees\r\nobtained from students will not pay the expenses of a first-class\r\nliterary institution.\r\n\r\nLastly, an education of a high order does not insure success in life,\r\nbut, other things being equal, the man of learning has the best chance\r\nto win in the race we are running.--_Eclectic Medical Journal_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN WAGES.--Senator Frye said in a public address in Boston: \"I\r\nsay from all my observations made there, and they were made as\r\ncarefully as I could make them, and in all honesty of purpose, there\r\nis only one country in Europe that comes within half of our wages, and\r\nthat is England, and the rest are not one-third, and some not within\r\none-quarter, of our wages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA AS A WHEAT PRODUCER.--\"Consul-General Bonham says she is a\r\ndangerous competitor of the United States. The report of Consul-General\r\nBonham at Calcutta, British India, treats at length of the wheat\r\ninterests of that country. The area devoted to wheat in 1886 was about\r\n27,500,000 acres, and the total yield 289,000,000 bushels. As compared\r\nwith the wheat of the Pacific coast, the Indian wheat is inferior, but\r\nwhen exported to Europe it is mixed and ground with wheat of a\r\nsuperior quality, by which process a fair marketable grade of flour is\r\nobtained. The method of cultivating the soil is in the main the same\r\nas it was centuries ago, and there seems to be great difficulty in\r\ninducing the farmer to invest in modern agricultural implements, and\r\nyet, with all the simple and primitive methods, the Indian farmers\r\ncan, in the opinion of the Consul-General, successfully compete with\r\nthose of the United States in the production of wheat. This is due to\r\nthe fact that the Indian farmer's outfit represents a capital of not\r\nmore than $40 or $50, and his hired help works, feeds, and clothes\r\nhimself on about $2.50 a month. The export of wheat from British India\r\nhas increased from 300,000 cwt. in 1868, to 21,000,000 cwt. in 1886,\r\nand the increase of 1886 over 1885 amounts to about 5,000,000 cwt.\r\n\r\n    \"The Consul-General says that some of his predecessors have\r\n    claimed that the United States has nothing to fear from India as\r\n    a competitor in the production of wheat. In this view he does\r\n    not concur, and believes that to-day India is second only to the\r\n    United States in wheat-growing. Furthermore, wheat-growing in\r\n    India is yet in its infancy, and its further development depends\r\n    principally upon the means of transportation to the sea-board.\r\n    He fears that with the cheap native labor of India and the\r\n    constantly growing facilities for transportation, the United\r\n    States will find her a formidable competitor as a producer of\r\n    wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nINCREASE OF INSANITY.--I have repeatedly referred to the increase of\r\ninsanity and crime under our heartless system of education. It is\r\nillustrated by every collection of statistics. The increase between\r\n1872 and 1885 was, in Maine, with five per cent. increase in\r\npopulation, in ten years, 23 per cent. increase in insanity. In New\r\nHampshire, 13 per cent. in population, 55 in insanity. In these two\r\nStates insanity increases four times as fast as population. In\r\nMassachusetts, population 33 per cent., insanity 91 per cent. In Rhode\r\nIsland, population 40 per cent., insanity 94 per cent. In Connecticut,\r\npopulation 23 per cent., insanity 194 per cent. The total number of\r\ninsane in New England has increased from 4,033, in 1872, to 7,232, in\r\n1885,--an increase of 3,199 in 13 years. Such are the estimates\r\nprepared from official reports by E. P. Augur, of Middletown, Conn. Is\r\nit possible by the repetition of such statements as these to rouse the\r\ntorpid conscience of the leaders of public opinion to the necessity of\r\na NEW EDUCATION?\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERANCE.--According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the\r\nannual consumption of liquors per capita in the United States, from\r\n1840 to 1886, shows a reduction in the consumption of distilled\r\nspirits to less than one-half of the average between 1840 and 1870.\r\nThe most marked decrease was between 1870 and 1872. The consumption of\r\nwine has averaged, from 1840 to 1870, about one-eighth as much--since\r\n1870, from 30 to 40 per cent. as much, but the consumption of malt\r\nliquors, which in 1840 and 1850 was little over half that of spirits,\r\nhas rapidly risen until, in 1886, it was nine times as great, the\r\nnumber of gallons per capita being of spirits, 1.24; wines, 0.38; malt\r\nliquors, 11.18. The total consumption of liquors of all sorts has\r\nrisen from 4.17 gallons per capita in 1840, to 12.62 in 1886. The\r\nconsumption of malt liquors per capita has increased fifty per cent.\r\nin the last seven years.\r\n\r\nThe tax collected on whiskey for 1886-87 was $3,262,945 less than for\r\nthe previous year, and the tax on beer was $2,245,456 more than for\r\nthe previous year.\r\n\r\n    \"Chevalier Max Proskowetz de Proskow Marstorn states that in\r\n    Austria inebriety is increasing everywhere on a dangerous scale.\r\n    The consumption of alcohol (taken as at 10 per cent.) was 6.7\r\n    litres a head in a population of 39,000,000; but in some\r\n    districts 15-1/2 litres was the average (4-1/2 litres go to a\r\n    gallon). In all Austro-Hungary there was an increase of nearly\r\n    4,000,000 florins in the cost of alcohol in 1884-85 over\r\n    1883-84. In 1885 there were 195,665 different places (stations,\r\n    gin-shops, and subordinate retails) where liquors were sold. In\r\n    districts where the most spirits are used there were fewer fit\r\n    recruits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAMBOYANT ANIMALISM.--In Boston, which sometimes calls itself our\r\nAmerican Athens, the highest truths of psychic science are daily\r\nneglected by the more influential classes, while races, games, and\r\npugilism occupy the largest space in the daily papers, and a leading\r\ndaily boasts of its more perfect descriptive and statistical record of\r\nall base-ballism as a strong claim to public support.\r\n\r\nThe pugilist Sullivan is the hero of Boston; he received a splendid\r\novation in the Boston Theatre, with the mayor and other dignitaries to\r\nhonor him, and a belt covered with gold and diamonds, worth $8,000,\r\nwas presented, besides a large cash benefit. His departure for England\r\nwas honored like that of a prince by accompanying boats, booming\r\ncannon, and tooting whistles, and he is said to swing a $2000 cane\r\npresented by his admirers. How far have we risen in eighteen centuries\r\nabove the barbarism of Rome? There is no heathen country to-day that\r\nworships pugilism. Perhaps when the saloon is abolished, we may take\r\nanother step forward in civilization. London has rivalled Boston,\r\ngiving Sullivan a popular reception by crowds which blocked up the\r\nprincipal streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCENDENTAL HASH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Winsted (Conn.) Press_ published an article on Buddhism in\r\nAmerica which is interesting as a specimen of the rosy-tinted fog of\r\nsome intellectual atmospheres, and the singular jumble of crude\r\nthought in this country. As an intellectual hash it may interest the\r\ncurious. The following is the article:\r\n\r\n\r\nBUDDHISM IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWhile sectarian Christianity is, at great expense, with much ado,\r\nmaking a few hundred converts in Asia among the ignorant, Buddhism is\r\nspreading rapidly in the United States, and is reaching our most\r\nintelligent people, without any propaganda of missionaries or force.\r\nThere are already thousands of Buddhists in this country, and their\r\nnumber is augmenting more rapidly perhaps than that of any other\r\nfaith, but of these probably comparatively few know that they are\r\nfollowing the Buddhistic lines of thought and have adopted the\r\nprinciples of Buddhistic faith. Theosophy, mental science (sometimes\r\ncalled \"Christian science\"), esoteric Christianity and Buddhistic\r\nmetaphysics are, we believe, substantially one and the same thing, and\r\nwe may also include their intimate relative, known here as Modern\r\nSpiritualism, the difference between them being no greater than that\r\nwhich invariably arises from different interpretations of the same\r\nidea by different individuals under differing environment. To compare\r\nthese differences with the differences of the Protestant sects would\r\nbe exalting the sects, for sectarian Christianity is hardly worthy of\r\nassociation with the exalted teachings of Buddha, the theosophists,\r\nand the finer conceptions of our modern metaphysicians and\r\nSpiritualists, yet we make the comparison for the sake of\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nCounting the philosophical modern Spiritualists we may say that the\r\nnumber of people in this country who, without knowing it, perhaps, are\r\nreasoning themselves into acceptance of Buddhistic teachings, may be\r\nplaced in the hundreds of thousands. A modified, spiritualized, and\r\nimproved form of Buddhism is, we suppose, likely to unite the\r\nliberalized minds of this country (normal Christians and Infidels\r\nalike) into a common and highly intellectual and spiritual faith,\r\nopposed to which will be the less advanced people under the leadership\r\nof the Roman Catholic church, representing the temporal power of\r\nChristian priestcraft and the mythological superstitions which have\r\nattached themselves to the precepts and teachings of the Christ man of\r\n1800 years ago.\r\n\r\nCertainly no intelligent observer can look out upon the tremendous\r\nupheaval of religious thought which is now taking place in this\r\ncountry, without seeing that a new era has dawned in the spiritual\r\nlife of the American people and foreseeing a readjustment of religious\r\nlines on a more elevated, less dogmatic and less antagonistic plane.\r\nWe have been passing through the very same experiences that preceded a\r\ndownfall of the polytheistic mythology, followed by the new era of\r\nChristian mythology in one part of the world and Buddhistic mythology\r\nin another. Jesus and Buddha both came to deliver exalted teachings\r\nwhich would lift the world out of bondage to an older faith and its\r\nmore cruel superstitions and the corruptions of priestcraft and gross\r\nceremonials; both were reformers of substantially the same abuses;\r\nboth suffered for humanity, both lived humble and inspired lives, both\r\nwere interpreters of the same truths to different peoples, both were\r\ngood men, and both have come down to us with their greatness\r\nexaggerated by their followers beyond anything they claimed for\r\nthemselves, while the personal existence of each is shrouded in the\r\nsame mystery and covered with the same doubt. That these two men did\r\nexist as men we may well believe, but that as personages they were\r\nincarnated on earth is a matter of small importance compared with the\r\nconsequences which have followed their supposed embodiment.\r\n\r\nThe decline of faith in the old theology and the silent acceptance of\r\nnew ideas by the church people of America, the rapid spread of\r\ninfidelity and aggressive agnosticism, and the hold which Modern\r\nSpiritualism under various disguises now has upon the people, premise\r\ntremendous changes, and indicate a new era of spiritual thought--an\r\nera of better and sweeter life for mankind we trust.\r\n\r\nMen and women who think alike will act together when prejudices born\r\nof old names, partisan rivalries and personal animosities are\r\noutgrown. A new philosophy with a new name, made up of the old truths\r\nwith new refinements and elaborations, will unite the liberal-minded\r\nin a fraternity of thought based on a better understanding of\r\nspiritual truths, and clearer comprehension of the importance to\r\nhumanity, of liberty, justice and love.\r\n\r\nThis new religion, if we mistake not the signs of the times, will or\r\ndoes partake largely of theosophic and Buddhistic metaphysics and is\r\nnot, therefore, to be despised by our best thinkers. Buddhism\r\ncorrupted by Brahmic theocracy--as Christianity by Mosaic rites, by\r\npapistic theology and sectarian piety--has come to us as a morbid\r\nasceticism or worse, delighting in self-inflicted individual tortures\r\nand revelling in unthinkable contradictions. This conception of it is\r\nprobably false and due more to deficiencies of language and\r\nunreceptive habit of metaphysical thought than to perversity of ideas.\r\nA system of highest ethics, and a religion without a personal God,\r\nBuddhism deifies the soul of man and exalts the individual through\r\ncountless experiences of physical embodiment into a position of\r\napparently infinite wisdom--a condition beyond phenomenal existence\r\nand of course indescribable. It neither annihilates life in nirvana\r\nnor admits immortal existence as we understand existence--i.e., in a\r\nperpetually objective form of some sort. It is better in some\r\nrespects, though older, than Christism. Buddhas and Christs alike, we\r\nare taught, are only men sent from celestial congress to direct their\r\nfellow men into higher paths leading to incomprehensible perfections,\r\nand they are not more \"gods\" than other men, save in their greater\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nTheosophy is to Buddhism what Modern Spiritualism is to\r\nChristianity--an acceptance of fundamental truths and rejection of\r\npriestly ceremonials; an adoption of the spirit and denial of the\r\nletter; an application of principles and ideas to real life and\r\nclaiming not only to have new light but to be ever progressive. It is\r\nhighly and intensely spiritual, and develops in some most marvellous\r\npowers over natural forces. Its spirituality, however, does not leave\r\nthe earth untouched and mortal needs unrecognized. It is an advance\r\nmovement in the East, bringing substance and actuality to much that in\r\nBuddhism is but vaporous ideality and bewildering prefiguration. It\r\nclaims that intervening land or water is no barrier to close personal\r\nassociation of its brotherhood, and that they are confined to no land\r\nor clime. Here in America it has followers who walk by its light, we\r\nare told, without knowing it, and many students trying to encompass\r\nthe mysteries of the occult science, which claims only to be like\r\nother science, the fruit of study and discovery, giving mastery over\r\nsubtle forces of nature which physical scientists fail to recognize.\r\nIts ethics are the highest conceivable, and the individual existence\r\nof the soul apart from the body a matter of commonest demonstration\r\namong the adepts.\r\n\r\nMental science so closely resembles theosophy, as we understand it,\r\nthat we hardly know the difference, save that of immaturity. It is\r\ntheosophy in its infancy, adapted to the status of American thought in\r\nthe psychological direction. Confined though it is at present chiefly\r\nto the curing of the sick it is by no means admitted that this is the\r\nlimit or more than the beginning of its adaptation to human needs. It\r\nis spending in this country with amazing rapidity, and though yet a\r\nchild is certain to bring about a great change in the ideas of many\r\nregarding mind, its power over and priority to matter. So far as its\r\nstudents devote their attention to other than such comprehension of\r\nits postulates as is necessary to become healers, they are Buddhistic\r\nin thought and expression, and some even accept a modified theory of\r\nmetempsychosis known as reincarnation. Still they reject the\r\nphilosophy of Spiritualism respecting spirit life, and appear to be\r\nall at sea as regards the immediate future of the individual. In their\r\nutterances on this they are more Buddhist than Christian, as in other\r\nrespects. They doubt or deny individual existence of the soul. The\r\nSpiritualist believes that his soul will have for all time a body of\r\nsome sort, spiritual or physical, and his spirit-world and life are\r\nfilled with very human occupations, thoughts and desires, carried on\r\namid familiar scenery in a very substantial and earth-like manner. He\r\nbelieves in progress eternal, and the possibility of final mergement\r\nof his individual self into the All-Self is so remote as to give him\r\nno concern. But the mental scientist, as near as we can express his\r\nnotion, rejects the idea of spiritual embodiment, regards his\r\npersonality as purely mortal and his soul one with indivisible God,\r\nnow and forever. Personality is not an attribute of his soul; spirit\r\nor astral body he does not understand as ever existing to preserve\r\nindividuality after physical dissolution--in this differing as much\r\nfrom the theosophist as from the Spiritualist.\r\n\r\nWhen these modernized Buddhists, Spiritualists and Christians, and\r\nliberal thinkers, generally, unite--as they easily may, for they have\r\nnow no irreconcilable disagreement--they will form a powerful body of\r\nthinking and progressive religionists. And their religion will be a\r\nbetter Buddhism than Buddha taught, a broader Christianity than Christ\r\nrevealed, a deeper Spiritual philosophy than Swedenborg or Davis\r\nheralded. Of course we welcome the opening day and its new light and\r\npromise, for the old theologies are wearisome emptiness and humbug,\r\nand the new isms cold and repellant or insufficient in their\r\ntestimony. We do not expect that a new church will arise and a new\r\nsectarianism follow. But a new conception of life, its origin, purpose\r\nand destiny may come to lift the people of America out of the old\r\nreligious rut. And in consequence the old depressing question, \"Is\r\nlife worth living?\" answered once by Buddha's No, may be answered anew\r\nby Humanity's Yes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe observations of this writer refer more to certain progressive and\r\nrestless classes in this Northeastern region than to the United States\r\ngenerally. The churches are not diminishing in the number of their\r\nmembers, but steadily gaining in numbers and also in liberality. The\r\nnew religion and philosophy of the future will be luminous, scientific\r\nand philanthropic--not a conglomeration of vague speculations. True,\r\nreverential religion is not a dreamy or speculative impulse, but an\r\nearnest love of mankind and of duty, which does not waste itself in\r\nunprofitable speculations, but eagerly pursues the positive knowledge\r\nof this life and the next, which gives practical wisdom and diffuses\r\nhappiness. All systems of religion talk about love and recommend it,\r\nbut their followers seldom realize it in their lives. The religion of\r\nthe future will _realize_ it. Apropos to this subject, Col. Van Horn,\r\nof the _Kansas City Journal_, says:\r\n\r\n    \"And as another result of missionary work, there are now in the\r\n    United States, in England and on the continent, missionaries of\r\n    Buddhism sent by the schools of the East, to convert us to the\r\n    philosophy of Gautama. This may sound startling to the general\r\n    reader, but it is not only a fact, but they have made converts\r\n    and are making them with a rapidity that is remarkable, making\r\n    more from us than we are from them. And they are from the very\r\n    best and brightest intellects among us--not the illiterate, but\r\n    the most cultured of the educated classes. It will not do to\r\n    suppress this fact in the discussion--for this is an age when\r\n    facts must be looked in the face.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST CRITICISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intellectual editor of the _Kansas City Journal_ has made some\r\nvery philosophic remarks on the materialistic philosophy of\r\nfashionable Scientists, which with some abridgment are here presented:\r\n\r\n    \"As an illustration of its methods of dealing with so subtle a\r\n    thing as human intelligence, we have a recent singular example\r\n    in Paris, by the eminent physician Charcot, and others, which\r\n    illustrates how great men in special departments walk blindfold\r\n    over things that afford no mystery to common minds. We allude to\r\n    certain experiments in hypnotism--the professional name for\r\n    mesmerism. The medical profession for more than half a century\r\n    sneered at the discoveries of Mesmer, until now compelled to\r\n    recognize them, they have not the manliness to acknowledge the\r\n    fact, but invent a new and inaccurate nomenclature to conceal\r\n    their change of front. To make a long story short these\r\n    gentlemen have put a subject under the influence one day,\r\n    enjoined him to commit a theft or a murder at a given hour the\r\n    next day, and despite every effort of will on the part of the\r\n    subject, the crimes have been attempted, and the victim only\r\n    saved from himself by the interposition of the operator, who was\r\n    present to remove the influence--or through the understanding of\r\n    the party against whom the offence was to be committed, in the\r\n    form of the robbery actually carried out.\r\n\r\n    \"But what does science do with this fact? Nothing but announce\r\n    it, and then proceed to dig among molecules and their related\r\n    agitations for the solution of the mystery.\"\r\n\r\n[This is what certain scientists do, but their follies are not\r\nchargeable to _Science_, nor to the whole body of Scientists. The\r\nablest thinkers to-day, the deepest inquirers, look to the powers of\r\nthe soul, and the new anthropology traces these powers to their\r\nlocalities in the brain.--ED. OF JOURNAL.]\r\n\r\n    \"How old is this fact? As old as the race. At one time it was\r\n    called necromancy, at another witchcraft, at another the\r\n    inspiration of God, at a subsequent time animal magnetism, at\r\n    another called after one of its more modern\r\n    discoverers,--mesmerism--now hypnotism--which is only another\r\n    name for magnetic sleep--if anybody knows what that is--or for\r\n    somnambulism. Common sense tells common people that it is only\r\n    an abnormal manifestation of the power that gives one person\r\n    control over another, or enables one person to influence\r\n    another. The simple every-day habit of exacting a promise from\r\n    your neighbor to do a certain thing, or for you to make a like\r\n    promise, and execute it. Sickness is a partial compliance with\r\n    the conditions of mortality--death being the complete process.\r\n    So the hypnotic experiences are the completed illustrations of\r\n    the common power which we call personal influence. That is all.\r\n    But that is not mysterious enough for learned people--it is not\r\n    scientific enough--as everybody can understand it.\r\n\r\n    \"Then, too, it suggests another thing that is fatal to it in the\r\n    estimation of the teacher--it suggests that what we call the\r\n    human mind or soul is a potential thing, that acts through the\r\n    every-day machinery of our bodies, and may be more or less\r\n    within the grasp of the common mind. There is a higher plane of\r\n    knowledge than that of mere physical science, and if the\r\n    theologian mistook its teaching, it is no reason why the pursuit\r\n    of that knowledge on this higher plane should be ignored. Hence\r\n    it is that this discovery by Charcot and others, to which we\r\n    allude, has as yet been barren of fruit, because the methods of\r\n    science to which the discoverers are wedded forbid the admission\r\n    of the psychic problem that underlies the remarkable phenomena.\r\n\r\n    \"And just here, it may as well be said first as last,--that the\r\n    profession to which these eminent men belong, nor any one school\r\n    of applied science, will ever read the lesson of these\r\n    experiments, nor will any of the so-called regular schools of\r\n    learning. The riddle will be read by some thinker outside, and\r\n    when the bread-and-butter purveyors of theology, science and the\r\n    schools have become indoctrinated, and prefer to pay their money\r\n    for the new instead of the old--then these self-constituted\r\n    teachers of humanity will all know that the cow was to eat the\r\n    grindstone--and teach the fact. We simply state a fact, known to\r\n    history, that the progress of the world is due to the inventor\r\n    and discoverer, and not to the schools. Every single thing, from\r\n    the advent of modern astronomy to the electric light, has been\r\n    from the ranks of the people by discovery or invention, and had\r\n    to fight its way against the teaching class, from time\r\n    immemorial. The circulation of the blood, which every\r\n    pig-sticker knew since knives were invented, had to be forced\r\n    upon medical science by a quack. And now, although the phenomena\r\n    we refer to have been before the teaching class since history\r\n    records anything, and although Mesmer taught it experimentally\r\n    eighty years ago, science has now only got so far as to admit\r\n    the existence of the phenomena.\r\n\r\n    \"Why have not the professions given these things more attention,\r\n    and why have they in these modern days for three quarters of a\r\n    century practically denied their existence? That question is a\r\n    legitimate one. And at the risk of being charged with\r\n    unfriendliness, it must be said that it was either from an\r\n    inability to think or from a narrow creedism that will not\r\n    accept a truth from outside discovery. The effect of this, and\r\n    what constitutes a crime in the teaching class, is, that it has\r\n    for all these long years shut out this now accepted knowledge\r\n    from the masses of humanity who look to this teaching class as\r\n    authority,--and to use a business form of speech,--pay them for\r\n    finding and teaching the truth. And so the learning of the world\r\n    and the common mass of mind has, after nearly a century, to\r\n    begin where the ostracised Mesmer left off--a long, dark, weary\r\n    denial of the truth by the simple refusal to investigate. This\r\n    is a serious arraignment, but it is admitted to-day by the\r\n    scientific world to be but the simple truth.\r\n\r\n    \"And what do we find now? Why, these same men who, for more than\r\n    eighty years, have been denying this truth, now whistle down the\r\n    wind as fanatics, dreamers and cranks, those who all the time\r\n    have recognized the truth, and been seeking the law underlying\r\n    its remarkable phenomena.\"\r\n\r\n[This strictly just arraignment applies to the entire body of the\r\nold-fashioned and so-called regular medical and clerical professions,\r\nall of whom have been educated into ignorance on these subjects by the\r\ncolleges, which are the chief criminals in this warfare against\r\nscience and progress. It was impossible to teach the true science of\r\nman in any college but the one of which I was one of the founders and\r\nthe presiding officer; to obtain the necessary freedom in teaching the\r\nhighest forms of science, I have been compelled to establish the\r\nCollege of Therapeutics in Boston.--ED. OF JOURNAL.]\r\n\r\nAnd this class holds simply that the human being is a living soul,\r\nthat, for the time being, acts through the organism we call the human\r\nbody, and that these living beings have an affinity of conditions by\r\nwhich they act and react one upon another, the manifestation of which\r\nwe call society or social life. That is all there is to this seeming\r\nmystery when reduced to simple terms. It is a question that chemistry\r\ncannot deal with because analysis is not the method. Molecules, to use\r\na homely phrase, are a good thing, but molecules don't think, and this\r\nthing we are considering does think. Molecules are amenable to\r\nchemical affinities, and their condition one instant is not and cannot\r\nbe their condition the next instant. So, if to-day at twelve o'clock\r\nthe molecules are in combination, chemically, to suggest a theft, they\r\nmay undergo, and we see do undergo, billions of changes before the\r\nhour of meridian arrives to-morrow--and not at all likely at that\r\nexact moment to be in the stealing combination again. Or, if so, it is\r\nnot likely to be for stealing exactly the same article it was combined\r\non the day previous. Yet this infinite series of impossibilities must\r\nbe possible to have the experiments we refer to come true--on the\r\ntheory of molecular action. This is one of those absurdities that men\r\ncall the marvellous discoveries of science. _No crank in Christendom\r\never conceived anything so utterly absurd._\r\n\r\nCommon sense comes to our help here, and tells us that this power is\r\nfrom an intelligence that controls molecules, and that this molecular\r\nactivity is but the motor force which this intelligence uses to\r\nexecute its purpose; that this purpose is, or may be, continuous,\r\nbecause this intelligence is continuous. And as it is thus paramount,\r\nand controlling as to this motor force, which to us is the phenomena\r\nof what we call life, it must be thus paramount, be persistent--or in\r\nother words, immortal. And it must be immortal because it has been the\r\nagent of conception and growth--or antecedent. And if it had the\r\nantecedent potency, its potentiality cannot cease when it becomes\r\nconsequent--or when the machinery which is propelled by this motor\r\nforce is worn out, or broken, and its use destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF DISCOVERY AND IMPROVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDERFUL INVENTIONS.--Prof. Elisha Gray's new discovery is called\r\n_autotelegraphy_, and it is claimed that it will be possible with its\r\nuse to write upon a sheet of paper and have an autographic facsimile\r\nof the writing reproduced by telegraph 300 miles away, and probably a\r\nmuch greater distance.--_Phil. Press._\r\n\r\nA Washington special in the New York _News_ says: The company owning\r\nthe _type-setting machine_ has arranged to put up fifty of these\r\nmachines for the transaction of business. They will be put up at once\r\nin New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Cincinnati, Chicago\r\nand other leading cities. The company claims that the machine is now\r\nperfect, and that each machine will perform as much work in setting\r\ntype as ten average compositors.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDISON'S PHONOGRAPH.--New York, October 21. Edison gives additional\r\nparticulars concerning his perfected phonograph. He finished his first\r\nphonograph about ten years ago. \"That,\" he says, \"was more or less a\r\ntoy. The germ of something wonderful was perfectly distinct, but I\r\ntried the impossible with it, and when the electric light business\r\nassumed commercial importance, I threw everything overboard for that.\r\nNevertheless, the phonograph has been more or less constantly in mind\r\never since. When resting from prolonged work upon light, my brain was\r\nfound to revert almost automatically to the old idea. Since the light\r\nhas been finished, I have taken up the phonograph, and after eight\r\nmonths of steady work have made it a commercial invention. My\r\nphonograph I expect to see in every business office. The first 500\r\nwill, I hope, be ready for distribution about the end of January.\r\nTheir operation is simplicity itself, and cannot fail. The merchant or\r\nclerk who wishes to send a letter has only to set the machine in\r\nmotion, and to talk in his natural voice, and at the usual rate of\r\nspeed, into a receiver. When he has finished the sheet, or\r\n'Phonogram,' as I call it, it is ready for putting into a little box\r\nmade on purpose for mails. We are making sheets in three sizes--one\r\nfor letters of from 800 to 1,000 words, another size for 2,000 words,\r\nand another size for 4,000 words.\r\n\r\n\"I expect that an agreement may be made with the post-office\r\nauthorities enabling phonogram boxes to be sent at the same rate as a\r\nletter. The receiver of the phonogram will put it into his apparatus\r\nand the message will be given out more clearly and distinctly than the\r\nbest telephone message ever sent. The tones of the voice in the two\r\nphonographs which I have finished are so perfectly rendered that one\r\ncan distinguish between twenty different persons, each one of whom has\r\nsaid a few words. One tremendous advantage is that the letter may be\r\nrepeated a thousand times. The phonogram does not wear out by use.\r\nMoreover, it may be filed away for a hundred years and be ready for\r\nthe instant it is needed. If a man dictates his will to a phonograph,\r\nthere will be no disputing the authenticity of the document with those\r\nwho knew the tones of his voice in life. The cost of making the\r\nphonograph will be scarcely more than the cost of ordinary letter\r\npaper. The machine will read out a letter or message at the same speed\r\nwith which it was dictated.\"\r\n\r\nEdison also has experimented with a device to enable printers to set\r\ntype directly from the dictation of the phonograph. He claims great\r\nprecision in repeating orchestral performances, so that the\r\ncharacteristic tones of all the instruments may be distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Type-setting Eclipsed_.--A new machine has been invented at\r\nMinneapolis which supersedes type-setting. By this machine, which is\r\nno larger than a small type-writer and operates on the same plan, a\r\nplate or matrix is produced, which is easily stereotyped, thus\r\nattaining the same result which is ordinarily reached by preparing a\r\nform of type for the foundry which has to be stereotyped and then\r\ndistributed. The speed of the new machine will be from five to ten\r\ntimes as great as that of type-setting, and if successful it will\r\nenable an author to send his work to the stereotyper more easily than\r\nhe can write it with the pen. When all ambitious would-be authors are\r\nlet loose upon the world in this manner, what a flood of superfluous\r\nliterature we shall have and what will become of the superfluous\r\nprinters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Printing in Colors_ has taken a potent move forward. By the new\r\nprocess a thousand shades can be printed at once. Instead of using\r\nengraved rollers or stones, as in the case of colored advertisements,\r\nthe designs or pictures are 'built up' in a case of solid colors\r\nspecially prepared, somewhat after the style of mosaic work. A portion\r\nis then cut or sliced off, about an inch in thickness, and this is\r\nwrapped round a cylinder, and the composition has only to be kept\r\nmoist, and any number of impressions can be printed. This will cause\r\nan extraordinary revolution in art work, also in manufactures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Edwin F. Field, of Lewiston, Me., has invented a substantial\r\n_steam wagon_ for common roads. There is no reason why such wagons\r\nshould not come into use. When first proposed in England they were put\r\ndown by jealousy and opposition, but I have always contended that the\r\nsteam engine should have superseded the horse fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT PRESERVING.--About Christmas time in 1885 people in San\r\nFrancisco were astonished to see fresh peaches, pears, and grapes,\r\nwith all their natural bloom, and looking plump and juicy, on\r\nexhibition in the windows of confectionery stores on Kearny and Sutter\r\nstreets. These fruits attracted great attention, and remained on\r\nexhibition several weeks, showing the preservative agent employed,\r\nwhatever it might be, was singularly powerful in resisting the natural\r\ndecay. When tasted or smelled of, the fruit showed no peculiarity that\r\ncould lead to a discovery of the secret of the mysterious process.\r\n\r\nIt appears now that the invention is at last to be made a practical\r\nsuccess on a large scale. The Allegretti Green Fruit Treatment and\r\nStorage System Company, with the main storehouse at West Berkeley,\r\nannounce that they are now ready to store and treat all kinds of green\r\narticles, by the week or month, and for shipment East. I. Allegretti,\r\nthe inventor of this system, stated that he had been experimenting\r\nwith various processes for preserving green fruit for twenty-six\r\nyears, and had succeeded in discovering this system, whose success has\r\nbeen demonstrated to the fruit-growers of this State.\r\n\r\nThe building in use at present is a frame structure, capable of\r\nstoring some fifty tons of fruit. The inner lining of the walls is\r\ngalvanized iron. There is no machinery used, and the only thing\r\nvisible is a large tank, supposed to contain the chemical preparation.\r\nThe arrangements are so made as to give an even temperature of 35\r\ndegrees.--_Oakland Enquirer._\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON'S MANUSCRIPT.--\"A manuscript by Napoleon I. has been sold in\r\nParis for five thousand five hundred francs. It was written by\r\nNapoleon at Ajaccio in 1790, and the language and orthography are said\r\nto be those of an uneducated person. In this manuscript he speaks with\r\nenthusiasm of Robespierre.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE.--Long and impatiently have I waited for the dawning of true\r\ncivilization and practical religion. It is coming now in the form of\r\nan international movement in favor of peace by arbitration. The\r\nBritish deputation which has visited this country to urge the\r\nnecessity of a treaty for arbitration, was entertained, Nov. 10th,\r\njust before their return, by the Commercial Club at the Vendome Hotel,\r\nin Boston, and many appropriate remarks were made by the distinguished\r\ngentlemen present, including Gov. Ames, and Mayor O'Brien. The\r\ndeputation consisted of W. R. Cremer, M.P., the most persistent\r\nadvocate of arbitration, Sir George Campbell, M.P., Andrew Provard,\r\nM.P., Halley Stewart, M.P., Benj. Pickard and John Wilson, who\r\nrepresent the workingmen of Great Britain. William Whitman of the\r\nClub, who presided at the entertainment, remarked, \"It is an inspiring\r\nfact, as well as indisputable evidence of social growth, that this\r\nappeal for arbitration as a permanent policy has come, not so much\r\nfrom kings, from rulers, or from statesmen, as from workingmen.... It\r\nwould create an epoch in human history second only in influence to the\r\nbirth of Christ, and be such a practical exemplification of religion\r\nas would awake the conscience and touch the heart of all peoples.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITAL PUNISHMENT is a relic of barbarism which society has not yet\r\noutgrown. It tends to cultivate vindictive sentiments, and, at the\r\nsame time, to generate a morbid sympathy for criminals. The execution\r\nof the Chicago Anarchists, as they are called, has had these effects.\r\nThey were not properly Anarchists in any philosophic sense, but rather\r\nrevolutionists, bent on destroying government and the republican rule\r\nof the majority by dynamite and assassination. Their death gives\r\nsatisfaction to the vast majority of the people, but their incendiary\r\nlanguage has done incalculable mischief, and greatly interfered with\r\nall rational and practicable measures of reform, as carried on by the\r\nKnights of Labor, co-operative banks and building societies,\r\nco-operative associations and schools of industrial education for both\r\nsexes. Just as we have a prospect of getting rid of international war,\r\nthis revolutionary communism proposes to introduce a social war that\r\nhas no definite purpose, but the indulgence of the angry passions\r\nwhich have been generated abroad by tyranny and poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTARCTIC EXPLORATION.--The Australian colony of Victoria has\r\nappropriated $50,000 for two ships to make a voyage of scientific\r\nexploration in the Antarctic circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE DESERT SHALL BLOSSOM AS THE ROSE.\"--\"The 'Great American Desert'\r\nwas long ago found out to be a myth; and now some of the remotest\r\ncorners which were once supposed to be included in it are proving to\r\noffer the largest promises of value for agricultural and grazing\r\npurposes. In New Mexico, for example, it has long been thought that\r\ncertain immense areas must always be comparatively useless because of\r\ntheir natural aridity. But engineers have just completed plans for\r\ntapping the Rio Grande with a canal and thus bringing under irrigation\r\na tract some ten miles wide and a hundred and fifty long, containing\r\nnearly a million acres. The addition of so vast an area to the arable\r\nland of the Territory means, of course, a large increase in the\r\nproductive resources of that section. Other canals may possibly do as\r\nmuch. The work of sinking artesian wells is also going on there\r\nextensively, while the project of constructing great storage\r\nreservoirs, in which the rainfall of the wet season may be collected\r\nand from thence gradually distributed through the dry season, is\r\nalready in serious contemplation by private enterprise. Modern\r\nscientific irrigation has already accomplished wonders for the\r\nagriculture of Utah; it seems likely to do even more for New Mexico.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n122 YEARS.--The great-grandfather of the dramatist Steele Mackaye,\r\nnamed John Morrison, was an old Covenanter and preached in the same\r\nparish a hundred years. He lived to be 122. His name, written in the\r\nold Bible after he was a centenarian, looks like a copperplate.\r\n\r\n\r\n154 YEARS.--The Cincinnati _Evening Telegram_ recently published a\r\nspecial from San Antonio, Tex., which says: News has just reached\r\nhere, from a most reliable source, of the recent death in the State of\r\nVera Cruz, Mex., of Jesus Valdonado, a farmer and ranchman of\r\nconsiderable possessions. This man's age at the time of death was\r\nindisputably 154 years. At Valdonado's funeral the pall-bearers were\r\nhis three sons, aged respectively 140, 120, and 109 years. They were\r\nwhite-haired, but strong and hearty, and in full possession of all\r\ntheir faculties.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICUS, Ga., Sept. 25.--Edmond Montgomery died on Nick Jordan's\r\nplace, near the county line of Schley, aged 102 years. He was an\r\nAfrican chief of the Askari tribe, and was taken to Virginia from\r\nAfrica in 1807, when he was a young man. He had a large family in\r\nVirginia, and when he died he left his third wife and 25 children in\r\nGeorgia. His grandchildren and great-grandchildren are unknown and\r\nunnumbered. He had remarkably good eyesight and health, and never took\r\na dose of medicine in his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRTY-THREE CHILDREN.--A West Virginian named Brown recently visited\r\nWashington to furnish evidence in a pension claim. Inquiry showed that\r\nhis mother had borne thirty-three children in all. Twenty of this\r\nnumber were boys, sixteen of whom had served in the Union army. Two\r\nwere killed. The others survived. The death of the two boys entitles\r\nthe mother to a pension. General Black says the files of the office\r\nfail to show another record where the sixteen sons of one father and\r\nmother served as soldiers in the late war.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF POVERTY.--\"M. Delerme, a distinguished Parisian physician,\r\nfound that in France the death rate of persons between the ages of\r\nforty and forty-five, when in easy circumstances, was only 8.3 per one\r\nthousand per annum, while the poorer classes of similar age died at\r\nthe rate of 18.7. That was two and one-half times as many of the poor\r\nas the rich died in France at these ages out of a given number\r\nliving.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNY LIND GOLDSCHMIDT, the famous Swedish singer, died at London Nov.\r\n1st at the age of 69. She was born of poor parents and made her first\r\nappearance on the stage at nine years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MRS. RACHEL STILLWAGON, of Flushing, claims to be the oldest woman on\r\nLong Island. She has just celebrated her 102d birthday, surrounded by\r\ndescendants to even the fifth generation. Three-quarters of a century\r\nago the fame of Mrs. Stillwagon's beauty extended as far south as\r\nBaltimore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.--THE LAW OF LOCATION IN ORGANOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The primal laws applied to the brain--The four directions--The\r\n    elements of good and evil--The horizontal line of\r\n    division--Frontal and occipital organs and vertical dividing\r\n    line--Preponderance of the front in certain heads--Gall,\r\n    Spurzheim, and Powell--Contrast of frontal and\r\n    occipital--Latitude, longitude, and antagonism--Location of\r\n    Health and Disease, of Benevolence, Conscientiousness,\r\n    Acquisitiveness and Baseness, Energy and Relaxation or\r\n    Indolence, Patience and Irritability--Duality of the brain and\r\n    its important consequences--Errors of old system--Self-respect\r\n    and Humility--Modesty and Ostentation--Combativeness and\r\n    Harmony--Love and Hate--Adhesiveness and Intellect, median and\r\n    lateral--Religion and Profligacy--Laws of arrangement and\r\n    Pathognomy--Physiological influences of basilar and coronal\r\n    regions--Insanity--beneficial influence of coronal region.\r\n\r\nTo feeble minds, that excel only in memory, an arbitrary statement of\r\nfacts to be recollected may be satisfactory, but to those who are\r\ncapable of fully understanding such a science as Anthropology,\r\narbitrary details, void of principle and reason, are repulsive. A\r\nchart of the human brain, without explanation of its philosophic basis\r\nand relations, embarrasses even the memory, for the memory of a\r\nphilosophic mind retains principles rather than details.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of experimental investigation, I have long since\r\nfully demonstrated that the human constitution is developed in\r\naccordance with the universal plan of animal life, and the human brain\r\nis organized functionally in accordance with those higher laws of\r\nlife, which control all the relations of the spiritual and material\r\nworlds,--all interaction between mind and matter. These primal laws\r\nare easily comprehended, and their application to the brain removes\r\nall the perplexing complexity of organology.\r\n\r\nTheir application to the brain may be stated as follows: The upper\r\nlegions of the brain, pointing upwards, relate to that which is\r\nabove,--to the spiritual realm, to love, religion, duty, hope,\r\nfirmness, and all that lifts us to a higher life. The lower regions\r\npoint downwards, and expend their energy upon the body, rousing the\r\nheart and all the muscles and viscera, developing the excitements,\r\npassions, and appetites.\r\n\r\nThe maximum upward tendency is at the middle of the superior region,\r\nand the maximum downward tendency at the middle of the basilar region,\r\nwhile organs half-way between them are neutral between these opposite\r\ntendencies. Hence every faculty or impulse has a location in the\r\nbrain, higher or lower, as it has a more spiritual or material\r\ntendency, and as its influence on the character inclines to virtue or\r\nvice. The better the faculty, the higher its location,--the more\r\ncapable of evil results, the lower it is placed. The higher position\r\ngiven to the nobler faculties accords with their right to rule the\r\ninferior nature, the predominance of which is evidently abnormal, and\r\nthe effects of which, in this abnormal predominance, are expressed by\r\nterms full of evil, although their functions in due subordination are\r\nuseful and absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nIn applying this principle, we realize that such a faculty as\r\nConscientiousness must be near the very summit, and that propensities\r\nto theft and murder must belong to the base. That such propensities\r\nexist in many, we know, and it is an absurd optimism which would\r\nignore such facts because they are abnormal. The world is full of\r\nhuman abnormality, because it is not yet above the juvenile age of its\r\ngrowth, which is the age of feebleness and folly, disease and crime.\r\nThe imperfect organism of childhood is incapable of resisting either\r\ntemptation or disease. The twenty-five millions destroyed by the black\r\ndeath, in the fourteenth century, and the countless millions destroyed\r\nby war in all centuries, including the present, show how little we\r\nhave advanced beyond the spirit of savage life. The ferocity of\r\nnations is as much the product of their cerebral organization, as the\r\nferocity of the tiger, and springs from the same region of the\r\nbrain,--lying on the ridge of the temporal bone,--a region that\r\ndelights in fierce destruction, and is large in all the carnivora. It\r\nwould be contrary to the spirit of science to ignore the fact that man\r\nhas an element of ferocity similar to that of the tiger, because in\r\nthe fully developed man that fierce element is overruled by the higher\r\npowers and confined to the destruction of that which does not suffer.\r\nThe unwillingness to recognize anything evil comes not from the spirit\r\nof science, but from the _a priori_ assumptions of sentimental\r\ntheology, which presumes that it thoroughly comprehends the Deity (who\r\nis beyond all human comprehension), and, out of its imaginative\r\nignorance, fabricates _a priori_ philosophies and doctrines that\r\neverything in man is good, or that everything in man is evil.\r\nAnthropology has not thus been evolved from _a priori_ speculation,\r\nbut presents its systematic doctrines as generalizations of the facts\r\nand experiments which have been carefully acquired and studied through\r\nthe last half-century. The facts and experiments are too numerous to\r\nbe recorded and published now, and had no channel for publication when\r\nthey occurred.\r\n\r\nEverything in the lower half of the brain has a tendency to evil, in\r\nproportion to its over-ruling power, and everything in the upper half\r\noperates in proportion to its elevation with that controlling\r\ninfluence against evil, which uplifts him toward angelic or divine\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\nThe brain may be divided by a horizontal line from the center of the\r\nforehead into its coronal and basilar halves, and by a vertical line\r\nfrom the cavity of the ear, into its frontal and occipital halves.\r\n\r\nThe vertical line separates the more passive and the more active\r\nfaculties. The posterior half of the brain is the source of the\r\nbackward forces by which the body is advanced, as the anterior half is\r\nthe source of the forward movements by which our progress is checked.\r\nThe posterior half would make blind, unceasing, irrepressible\r\naction--the anterior half would produce a state of relaxed and feeble\r\ntranquillity and sensibility--the condition of a helpless victim. The\r\nconcurrence of the two is indispensable to human life, and the\r\nnecessity of their more or less symmetrical balance is so great that\r\nnature balances the head upon the condyles of the occipital bone, at\r\nthe summit of the neck, which are so located as to correspond very\r\nnearly with the opening of the ear.\r\n\r\nThe contour of the head is very nearly that of a semicircle, with its\r\ncenter an inch or more above the cavity of the ear. Thus wisely has\r\nnature arranged in well-balanced individuals the symmetrical\r\nproportion between the active and passive elements of life. In the\r\nhead of the writer there is a preponderance of the passive over the\r\nactive elements, which gives him the attraction to a studious, rather\r\nthan active or ambitious life.[1] In nations or races of ambitious\r\ncharacter, the head is long, or _Dolico-cephalic_, and the occipital\r\nmeasurement is larger than the frontal, but in those of peaceful,\r\nunambitious character, like the ancient Peruvian and the Choctaws of\r\nthe United States, the occipital measurement is less than the frontal.\r\n\r\n    [1] The head of Dr. Gall shows the same frontal preponderance,\r\n        which led him to the pursuits of intellect instead of\r\n        ambition, but also shows an immense force of character\r\n        derived from its extreme breadth and basilar depth. The head\r\n        of Spurzheim, whose skull I have often examined, shows even\r\n        a greater preponderance of the front, and a predominance of\r\n        the coronal over the basilar region, producing his marked\r\n        amiability, with sufficient basilar breadth to give him\r\n        physical force.\r\n\r\n        Each had a large brain. In Dr. Wm. Byrd Powell, who had a\r\n        long head, and who was a man of restless ambition and fiery\r\n        energy, the occipital predominated over the frontal\r\n        development decidedly, producing, although the frontal\r\n        development was not large, much activity and force, or\r\n        brilliancy of mind, but not the calm temperament most\r\n        favorable to philosophy. His opinions were more bold and\r\n        striking than accurate. Dr. P. made a valuable collection of\r\n        crania, and was almost the only American scientist who gave\r\n        much attention to the _cultivation_ of phrenology.\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks the reader will understand that force belongs to\r\nthe occiput and gentleness to the front. The occipital region is\r\nassociated with the spinal column and the limbs, in which regions the\r\nvital forces reside. Hence the occipital action of the brain generates\r\nvital force and diffuses it in the body, while the frontal region, in\r\nits aggregate tendency, expends the vital force--the greatest tendency\r\nto expenditure being in the most extreme frontal region. Both the\r\nfront lobe and the anterior extremity of the middle lobe tend to the\r\nexpenditure of vital force and destruction of health, and it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to life that the action of the front lobe should\r\nbe suspended one-third of our time by sleep, without which it would\r\nexhaust vitality.\r\n\r\nWe shall therefore find that organs are located farther backward in\r\nproportion to the energy and impelling power of the faculty, and farther\r\nforward in proportion to their delicacy and intellectuality--the\r\nextreme front being the region of maximum intelligence.\r\n\r\nWith these two rules, giving the latitude by the ethical quality and\r\nthe longitude by the active energy, I have been accustomed to require\r\nmy pupils to determine the location of the various elements of human\r\nnature, bearing in mind that organs of analogous functions are located\r\nnear together, and organs of opposite or antagonistic functions occupy\r\nopposite locations in the brain; and thus in proportion as one is\r\nabove the horizontal line the other is below it, and in proportion as\r\none is forward the other is backward,--in proportion as one is\r\ninterior or near the median line, the other is exterior or toward the\r\nlateral surface.\r\n\r\nWith this introductory explanation, I begin by asking, Where should we\r\nlocate the faculty which has the maximum degree of healthy influence,\r\nand is therefore called Health? They will readily decide that it\r\nbelongs to the posterior half of the head, but not the most posterior,\r\nas it is not of restless or impulsive character. Then as to its\r\nlatitude they readily decide that it must be considerably above the\r\nmiddle zone and in the upper posterior region where, after comparing\r\nlocations, they generally agree that its position corresponds to the\r\nspot marked by the letters He.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe then inquire where the faculties should be located which give us\r\nthe least capacity to resist disease, the least buoyant health, and\r\nthe greatest liability to succumb to injuries. This being opposite to\r\nthe last faculty must be located diametrically opposite, in a position\r\nanterior and inferior, which would bring it to the anterior end of the\r\nmiddle lobe. As this organ gives so great a sensitive liability to\r\ndisease, it is not improper to call it the organ of Disease, if we\r\nrecollect that that is its abnormal action, as murder is the abnormal\r\naction of Destructiveness. Its normal action gives a very acute\r\ninterior sensibility by means of which we understand our physical\r\ncondition and are warned of every departure from health.\r\n\r\nThe pupils generally locate this organ very nearly as is shown by the\r\nletters Di.\r\n\r\nWe have now gained an additional rule for guiding the location, viz.,\r\nthat in proportion as a faculty is of healthy tendency it is located\r\nnearer to Health, and in proportion as it is of morbid tendency it\r\nmust be located nearer to Disease.\r\n\r\nLet us now take two such faculties as Benevolence or good will and\r\nIntegrity or Conscientiousness. They will readily decide that\r\nBenevolence must be in the superior anterior region, as it is a virtue\r\nof the weak or yielding class, and that Conscientiousness, which makes\r\nus just and honest, must be among the highest organs, much farther\r\nback than Benevolence but not so far back as Health. There is no\r\ndifficulty in agreeing upon the locations, shown by the letters Be.\r\nand Con.\r\n\r\nIf now we seek for the opposite faculties, which lead to selfish and\r\ndishonorable action, the antagonist of Benevolence will be unanimously\r\nlocated below and behind the centre, where it is represented by the\r\nletters Ac., as Avarice or Acquisitiveness is the leading\r\nmanifestation of the selfish faculty.\r\n\r\nAs the faculty of Conscientiousness gives us the control of our\r\nimpulses and selfish or sensual inclinations to qualify for the\r\nperformance of duty, its antagonist gives the vigor to the sensual,\r\nviolent and selfish passions, and prompts to the utter disregard of\r\nduty. The one being vertically above the centre of the brain, the\r\nother must be vertically below it; one being on the upper the other\r\nmust be on the basilar surface. This brings it below the margin of the\r\nmiddle lobe, which is above the cavity of the ear. Hence through the\r\ncavity of the ear we reach underneath the basis of the middle lobe,\r\nwhere it rests on the petrous ridge of the temporal bone, and the\r\nexternal marking would correspond to the cavity of the ear or meatus\r\nauditorius. For this organ and faculty, the name which would express\r\nits unrestrained action is Baseness, as it would lead to the\r\ncommission of many crimes and the violation of all honesty and\r\njustice. For its moderate and restrained activity, the term\r\nSelfishness would be sufficient as it induces us to heed our selfish\r\nappetites, interests, and passions, in opposition to the voice of\r\nduty. Its more normal activity is to invigorate our animal life\r\ngenerally and prevent us from going too far in the line of duty,\r\npatience, forbearance and benevolence. Let it be marked Ba. Its\r\nposition will be recognized on the vertical line between the frontal\r\nand occipital, as it is not an element of energy and success, nor of\r\ndebility, but simply an element of debasing animalism, which is not\r\ndestitute of force.\r\n\r\nThere are in the human constitution the opposite elements of untiring\r\nenergy or industry, and of indolent relaxation. To the former we must\r\ngive an exalted position, as it is the sustaining power of all the\r\nvirtues; and it must evidently be farther back than conscientiousness\r\nas it is of a more vigorous character. It is favorable to health and\r\ntherefore near that organ, and being free from selfishness it is not\r\nfar behind Conscientiousness. The letters En. show its location.\r\nEnergy being thus behind Conscientiousness, its antagonist Relaxation,\r\nthe source of indolence, must be anterior to Baseness, where we locate\r\nthe letters Re.\r\n\r\nThe opposite elements of Serenity or Patience, and Irritability are\r\neasily located; the former is obviously entitled to a high position.\r\nFrom its quiet nature it cannot be assigned to the occiput, and from\r\nits steady, unyielding and supporting strength, it cannot be assigned\r\nto the frontal region. It must, therefore, be in the middle superior\r\nregion, where the letters Pa. locate it. Irritability must be on the\r\nmedian line of the basilar range (and antagonizes Patience on the\r\nmiddle line above), but not as low as Baseness, for one may be\r\nhonorable though irritable and high-tempered, but such temper is not\r\ncompatible with very strict conscientiousness.\r\n\r\nIn locating organs we are to remember that the brain is not a single\r\nbut a double apparatus--a right and a left brain, each complete in all\r\nthe organs; consequently, we are in this instance locating our organs\r\nin the left hemisphere alone, in which the median line where it meets\r\nthe other hemisphere is on its right side, and the exterior surface is\r\non its left. An organ located at the median line, or inner surface, as\r\nPatience, must have its antagonist at the external or lateral surface,\r\nas Irritability.\r\n\r\nThe right hemisphere has the organs of the left side along the median\r\nline, and the organs of its right side on the exterior surface. The\r\nleft hemisphere has the reverse arrangement. Consequently, the right\r\nside of each hemisphere and the left side of the other are identical\r\nin function. How then does the right side of one compare with the\r\nright side of the other, and the left side with the left? Dr. Gall and\r\nhis followers have overlooked these questions, and fallen into very\r\ngreat errors in consequence. Gall, for this reason, was mistaken in\r\nthe natural language of the organs, as will be hereafter shown, having\r\nspoken of it as if we had a single brain, and also mistaken in many of\r\nthe organs concerning which a knowledge of the relations of the two\r\nhemispheres to each other would have corrected the errors. There is a\r\nstriking analogy, or coincidence of function between the two right\r\nsides and between the two left sides never suspected prior to my\r\ninvestigations and experiments.\r\n\r\nLet us next look for the sentiment of Pride, or Self-respect, which\r\nhas been called Self-esteem. It is a sentiment of conscious ability.\r\nIts character is dignity, rather than selfishness. We readily perceive\r\nthat it must be in the upper region, but considerably behind the\r\nvertical line, where we place the letters S.R.\r\n\r\nThe question may now arise whether it should be nearer to the right or\r\nthe left side of the hemisphere, its inner or outer surface. The law\r\ngoverning this matter is that organs of external manifestation are at\r\nthe median line, but those of more interior and spiritual character\r\nare generally at the lateral or exterior surface. Self-respect, or\r\nPride, is an organ of strong exterior manifestation, and is,\r\ntherefore, at the median line between the hemispheres. Its antagonist\r\nmust, therefore, be sought at the external or lateral surface, as far\r\nbelow the horizontal division, as Self-respect is above it, and as far\r\nforward as Self-respect is backward. Hence we find Humility where the\r\nletters Hu. are located.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a specific antagonist to Self-esteem was never entertained\r\nin the phrenological school, but it is obviously indispensable, for\r\nHumility, which gives an humble or servile character, and disqualifies\r\nfor any high position, is as positive an element as the opposite, and\r\nis very common in the dependent and humble classes of society. This\r\norgan diminishes our psychic energy in proportion to its distance in\r\nfront of the ear and qualifies for submission instead of command.\r\n\r\nIf we look for the seat of Modesty, we should look in front of the\r\near, but not so far forward as for Intellect. We would look near the\r\nhorizontal line, not to the upper surface, and would see the propriety\r\nof locating it in the temples at the letters Mo. For its antagonism in\r\nOstentation we should look to the occiput. That species of modesty\r\nwhich produces a bashful and yielding character will be found just\r\nbelow the horizontal line, while that form of modest sentiment which\r\nproduces the highest refinement rises into connection with love at the\r\nupper surface. The organ thus runs obliquely upward, corresponding to\r\nthe position of the convolutions. The antagonist, Ostentation, extends\r\nabove and below the letters Ost. on the occiput.\r\n\r\nIf we seek the organs that impel to contention and combat, we would\r\nnaturally look to the lower posterior region, but not the lowest. We\r\nfind Combativeness behind the ear, marked Com. Its antagonist, which\r\nshuns strife and seeks harmony, must evidently be in the superior\r\nanterior region, and near the intellectual organs which it resembles\r\nin function by facilitating a mutual understanding, and giving a\r\nspirit of concession. The location is marked Har. for Harmony. It\r\nembraces a group of organs of harmonious tendency, such as Friendship,\r\nPoliteness, Imitation, Humor, Pliability and Admiration, as the\r\nCombative group is hostile, stubborn, morose and censorious.\r\n\r\nFor the sentiment of Love we look to the upper surface of the brain as\r\nthe seat of the nobler sentiments. Being a stronger sentiment than\r\nHarmony, it should be located farther back where we place the letters\r\nLove. Its antagonism must be on the basilar surface, and a little\r\nbehind the vertical line, as Love is before it. This antagonistic\r\nfaculty would domineer and crush. Its extremest action would result in\r\nHatred. Its location is marked by the letters Ha. and Do.\r\n\r\nUpon the principles already stated, the intellect occupies the extreme\r\nfront of the brain--the anterior surface of the front lobe. Its\r\ngeneral character will be represented by its middle--the region of\r\nConsciousness and of Memory (Memory). The faculties that relate to\r\nphysical objects, the intellect common to animals, would necessarily\r\noccupy the lower stratum along the brow (Perception), while the higher\r\nspecies of intellect would occupy a higher position at the summit of\r\nthe forehead. Sagacity, Reason, and other similar forms of intellect,\r\nmarked Understanding, are above--physical conceptions below--Memory,\r\nwhich retains both, lying between them.\r\n\r\nThe perceptive power, with the widest exterior range, is at the median\r\nline, where we find clairvoyance; and the interior meditative power,\r\nsuch as Invention, Composition, Calculation, and Planning, belongs to\r\nthe lateral or exterior surface of the forehead, according to the\r\nprinciples just stated. Adhesiveness (Adh.) is the centre of the\r\nantagonism to the intellect.\r\n\r\nReligion, which relates to the infinite exterior, to the universe and\r\nits loftiest power, must evidently be upon the median line and in the\r\nhigher portion of the brain, farther back than Benevolence, as it is a\r\nstronger sentiment, but not so far back as Patience and Firmness.\r\n\r\nIts antagonism must be at the lower external surface, behind\r\nIrritability, (as Religion is before Patience,) but before\r\nAcquisitiveness. The tendency of such a faculty must be toward a\r\nlawless defiance of everything sacred, a passionate, impulsive\r\nself-will and selfishness, resulting in lawless profligacy. Profligacy\r\nwould, therefore, be the name for its predominance (Pr.), while\r\nexecutive independence and energy for selfish purposes would be its\r\nmore normal manifestation.\r\n\r\nThus we might go over the entire brain, showing that all the locations\r\nof functions which have been learned from comparison of crania with\r\ncharacter, and which have been absolutely demonstrated by experiments\r\nupon intelligent persons, are arranged in accordance with general laws\r\nwhich are easily understood. The perfection of divine wisdom is made\r\nfully apparent when we see the vast complexity of the psychic\r\nphenomena of man.\r\n\r\n    \"A MIGHTY MAZE BUT NOT WITHOUT A PLAN,\"\r\n\r\nsubjected to laws of arrangement and harmony that make it so clearly\r\nintelligible. Far more do we realize this when we master the science\r\nof PATHOGNOMY, and discover that all the attributes or faculties of\r\nthe human soul, and all its complex relations with the body, are\r\ndemonstrably subject to mathematical laws.\r\n\r\nI do not propose in this sketch to go through all the details of the\r\nlocalities as I might with the anatomical models before a class, but\r\nwould refer, in conclusion, to the location of the physiological\r\nfunctions of the brain.\r\n\r\nIts basilar surfaces, pointing downwards, have their normal influence\r\nupon the body. Behind the ear they act upon the spinal cord and\r\nmuscular system. Hence basilar depth produces vital force and muscular\r\npower. But as the basilar functions, which use the body, are opposite\r\nto the coronal functions which sustain our higher nature, it follows\r\nthat excessive use of the body, either for exertion or for sensual\r\npleasure, is destructive to our higher faculties, operating in many\r\nrespects like the indulgence of the lower passions. Hence mankind are\r\nimbruted by excessive toil as well as by excessive sensuality and\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nWhile the basilar region behind the ear operates upon the posterior\r\npart of the trunk, that portion in front of the ear operates more\r\nanteriorly, affecting the viscera, in which there is no muscular\r\nvigor, and the tendency of which is toward indolence. Thus the\r\nvertical line separates the indolent from the energetic basilar\r\nfunctions, and all the enfeebling, sensitive, morbid faculties that\r\nimpair our energies are in the anterior basilar region.\r\n\r\nThe normal action of these organs, however, is necessary to life, and\r\nsustains the visceral system in the reception of food and expulsion of\r\nwaste. But as it is the region of sensibility to all influences, it\r\nrenders us liable to all derangements of body and mind, unless we are\r\nstrongly fortified by our occipital strength. The tendency to bodily\r\ndisorder has been explained by reference to the organs of Disease and\r\nHealth. Insanity, or derangement of the mind and nervous system,\r\nbelongs to a basilar and anterior location, which we reach through the\r\njunction of the neck and jaw (marked Ins.). It is more interior, but\r\nnot lower than Disease, in the brain. Its antagonism is above on the\r\ntemporal arch, between the lateral and upper surfaces of the brain,\r\nmarked San. for Sanity. It gives a mental firmness which resists\r\ndisturbing influences.\r\n\r\nThe coronal region or upper surface of the brain has the opposite\r\ninfluence to that of the basilar organs in all respects, withdrawing\r\nthe nervous energy from the body, tranquillizing its excitements, and\r\nattracting all vital energy to the brain, especially in its upper\r\nregion. By sustaining the brain, which is the chief seat of life, and\r\nby restraining the passions, the coronal region is more beneficial to\r\nhealth and longevity than any other portion. In the posterior part it\r\nnot only has this happy effect, but by sustaining the occipital half\r\nof the brain, gives a normal and healthy energy to all the powers of\r\nlife. Such is the influence of the group of organs in which Health is\r\nthe centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the study of the brain reveals laws\r\nwhich give us the strongest inducement to an honorable life as the\r\nonly road to success and happiness.\r\n\r\nTo show the facility with which organs may be located upon general\r\nprinciples, I present herewith the locations actually made by a small\r\nclass of pupils when I first proposed to have them determine locations\r\naccording to the general laws of organology. None of these locations\r\nwould be called erroneous, the most incorrect of all being\r\nAdhesiveness, located a little too high. They are Be. Benevolence, Ac.\r\nAcquisitiveness, Phi. Philanthropy, Des. Destructiveness, Lo. Love,\r\nHa. Hate, Hu. Humor, Mod. Modesty, Os. Ostentation, Con.\r\nConscientiousness, Ba. Baseness, Pa. Patience, Irr. Irritability, For.\r\nFortitude, Al. Alimentiveness, Her. Heroism, Sen. Sensibility, Hea.\r\nHealth, Dis. Disease, Ad. Adhesiveness, Co. Combativeness, Ar.\r\nArrogance, Rev. Reverence, Ca. Cautiousness, Ra. Rashness.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion cannot be too often repeated that the nomenclature of\r\ncerebral organology can never adequately express the functions of the\r\norgans. The brain has in all its organs physiological and psychic\r\npowers, which no one word can ever express fully. Sometimes a good\r\npsychic term, such as Firmness, suggests to the intelligent mind a\r\ncorresponding influence on the physiological constitution, but in the\r\npresent state of mental science the conception of such a\r\ncorrespondence is very vague.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even the psychic functions are not adequately represented by\r\nthe words already coined in the English language for other purposes,\r\nand I do not think it expedient at present to coin new terms which\r\nwould embarrass the student. The word Sanity, for example, answers its\r\npurpose by signifying a mental condition so firm and substantial as to\r\ndefy the depressing and disturbing influences that derange the mind.\r\nIt produces not the mere negative state, or absence of insanity, but a\r\npositive firmness, and self-control, which is the interior expression\r\nof firmness. The cheerful, stable, manly, and well-regulated character\r\nwhich it produces, disciplines alike the intellect and the emotions,\r\nand shows itself in children by an early maturity of character and\r\ndeportment, and freedom from childish folly and passion.\r\n\r\nIf a new word should be introduced to express this function, the Greek\r\nword SOPHROSYNE would be a very good one, as it signifies a\r\nself-controlled and reasonable nature. The verb ANDRISO, signifying to\r\nrender hardy, manly, strong, to display vigor, and make a manly effort\r\nof self-control, would be equally appropriate in the adjective form,\r\nANDRIKOS, and still more in the noun ANDRIA, which signifies manhood\r\nor manly sentiments and conduct. It would not, however, be preferable\r\nto the English word, MANLINESS, which is as appropriate a term as\r\nSanity or ANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO YOU PERSONALLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe JOURNAL OF MAN acknowledges with pleasure your co-operation during\r\nthe past year, its trial trip. It presumes from your co-operation,\r\nthat you are one of the very few truly progressive and large-minded\r\nmortals who really wish to lift mankind into a better condition, and\r\nwho have that practical sagacity (which is rare among the educated) by\r\nwhich you recognize great truths in their first presentation before\r\nthey have the support of the leaders of society. If among our readers\r\nthere are _any_ of a different class, they are not expected to\r\ncontinue. The sincere friends of the JOURNAL have shown by many\r\nexpressions in their friendly letters, that they are permanent\r\nfriends, and as the present size of the JOURNAL is entirely inadequate\r\nto its purposes, they desire its enlargement to twice its present size\r\nand price. They perceive that it is the organ of the most important\r\nand comprehensive movement of intellectual progress ever undertaken by\r\nman, and they desire to see its mission fulfilled and the benefit\r\nrealized by the world, in a redeeming and uplifting education, a\r\nreliable system of therapeutics, a scientific and beneficent religion,\r\na satisfactory spiritual science, and the uplifting of all sciences by\r\nPsychometry. But it is important to know in advance that all the\r\nJOURNAL'S present readers desire to go on in an enlarged and improved\r\nissue. You are, therefore, requested to signify by postal card your\r\nintentions and wishes as to the enlarged JOURNAL. Will your support be\r\ncontinued or withdrawn for the next volume, and can you do anything to\r\nextend its circulation? An immediate reply will oblige the editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSES OF OUR READERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe generous appreciation of the JOURNAL OF MAN by the liberal press\r\nwas shown in the May number, as well as the enthusiastic appreciation\r\nof its readers. The proposition for its enlargement has called forth a\r\nkind and warm response from its readers, from which the few quotations\r\nfollowing will show how well the JOURNAL has realized their hopes and\r\ndesires. \"I will try to get one or two more subscribers to what I\r\nregard as the best journal I have ever known, going as it does to the\r\nroot of the most vital and most important interests of man, and\r\ndealing with great principles so vigorously and fairly.\"--G.

B. \"It has filled a\r\nlong-felt want in my mind.\"--E. C. B., M. D. \"I wish that every editor\r\nin the world was actuated by the same spirit that seems to actuate\r\nyou.

The\r\nflattering responses already received are not sufficient in number to\r\njustify enlargement. Unless the remainder of the readers of the\r\nJOURNAL shall express themselves in favor of enlargement it will not\r\nbe attempted. The editor is willing to toil without reward, but not to\r\ntake up a pecuniary burden in addition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPSYCHOMETRIC PRACTICE.\r\n\r\nMrs. C. H.

It\r\ncame first by mesmeric hypnotism, which was applicable only to a few,\r\nand was restricted by the jealous hostility of the old medical\r\nprofession. Then came the nitrous oxide, introduced by Dr. Wells, of\r\nHartford, and promptly discountenanced by the enlightened (?) medical\r\nprofession of Boston, and set aside for the next candidate, ether,\r\ndiscovered in the United States also, but far inferior to the nitrous\r\noxide as a safe and pleasant agent. This was largely superseded by\r\nchloroform, discovered much earlier by Liebig and others, but\r\nintroduced as an anæsthetic in 1847, by Prof. Simpson. This proved to\r\nbe the most powerful and dangerous of all. Thus the whole policy of\r\nthe medical profession was to discourage the safe, and encourage the\r\nmore dangerous agents. The magnetic sleep, the most perfect of all\r\nanæsthetic agents, was expelled from the realm of college authority;\r\nether was substituted for nitrous oxide, and chloroform preferred to\r\nether, until frequent deaths gave warning.\r\n\r\nNitrous oxide, much the safest of the three, has not been the\r\nfavorite, but has held its ground, especially with dentists. But even\r\nnitrous oxide is not perfect. It is not equal to the magnetic sleep,\r\nwhen the latter is practicable, but fortunately it is applicable to\r\nall. To perfect the nitrous oxide, making it universally safe and\r\npleasant, Dr. U. K. Mayo, of Boston, has combined it with certain\r\nharmless vegetable nervines, which appear to control the fatal\r\ntendency which belongs to all anæsthetics when carried too far. The\r\nsuccess of Dr. Mayo, in perfecting our best anæsthetic, is amply\r\nattested by those who have used it. Dr. Thorndike, than whom Boston\r\nhad no better surgeon, pronounced it \"the safest the world has yet\r\nseen.\" It has been administered to children and to patients in extreme\r\ndebility. Drs. Frizzell and Williams say they have given it\r\n\"repeatedly in heart disease, severe lung diseases, Bright's disease,\r\netc., where the patients were so feeble as to require assistance in\r\nwalking, many of them under medical treatment, and the results have\r\nbeen all that we could ask--no irritation, suffocation, nor\r\ndepression. We heartily commend it to all as the anæsthetic of the\r\nage.\" Dr. Morrill, of Boston, administered Mayo's anæsthetic to his\r\nwife with delightful results when \"her lungs were so badly\r\ndisorganized, that the administration of ether or gas would be\r\nentirely unsafe.\" The reputation of this anæsthetic is now well\r\nestablished; in fact, it is not only safe and harmless, but has great\r\nmedical virtue for daily use in many diseases, and is coming into use\r\nfor such purposes. In a paper before the Georgia State Dental Society,\r\nDr. E. Parsons testified strongly to its superiority. \"The nitrous\r\noxide (says Dr. P.) causes the patient when fully under its influence\r\nto have very like the appearance of a corpse,\" but under this new\r\nanæsthetic \"the patient appears like one in a natural sleep.\" The\r\nlanguage of the press generally has been highly commendatory, and if\r\nDr. Mayo had occupied so conspicuous a rank as Prof. Simpson, of\r\nEdinburgh, his new anæsthetic would have been adopted at once in every\r\ncollege of America and Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                           THE OPEN COURT.\r\n\r\n                             PUBLISHED BY\r\n\r\n                  The Open Court Publishing Company,\r\n\r\n                           Rooms 41 and 42,\r\n                       169-175 LA SALLE STREET,\r\n                               CHICAGO.\r\n\r\n    B.
