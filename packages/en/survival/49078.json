ALBERT FROST\r\n\r\n                                LONDON\r\n                        VINTON & COMPANY, LTD.\r\n               8, BREAM’S BUILDINGS, CHANCERY LANE, E.C.\r\n                                 1915\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past year I have seen enquiries for a book on the management\r\nof Shire Horses; therefore I have made an attempt to supply the want.\r\nThat the result leaves much--very much--to be desired I am well aware,\r\nbut at least the little work is free from fine phrases and technical\r\nterms. Farmers prefer practical advice to literary merit in any book,\r\nor paper, that they read, and this is written by one of their own class.\r\n\r\nFor six months England has been engaged in war, the most awful yet\r\nwaged for the reason that half the world is involved in it. It\r\nnaturally follows that little is read but war news. Consequently these\r\npages will be regarded as dull and uninteresting by those who have\r\nbecome accustomed to thrilling stories from battlefields, seas, or\r\nskies.\r\n\r\nBy those who take an interest in the world’s heaviest breed of horses,\r\nas well as war news, this book may be tolerated, seeing that it deals\r\nwith the old “War Horse” of Britain, many true descendants being\r\nactively engaged in moving “tons and guns” at the present time. I make\r\nno claim to having written anything new, but as a kind of pocket record\r\nof what Shire breeders, and exhibitors, have hitherto accomplished with\r\ntheir animals the facts herein contained may be useful, and I hope that\r\nall readers, as well as Shire breeders, will forgive any inaccuracies\r\nin my figures and all the imperfections in this my first attempt at\r\nbook-writing.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 I won a small prize, offered by an agricultural paper for a\r\nshort article entitled “Rent-Paying Horses,” which I tried to point\r\nout were Shire Horses. Since then I have contributed a little to the\r\nlive stock papers on the same subject, including an article for the\r\n_Farmer and Stockbreeder Year Book_ of 1906, which is reprinted by the\r\neditor’s permission. It was over the initials “S. H. L.,” which mean\r\n“Shire Horse Lover.” I have been that from my school days, but never a\r\ngreater one than now.\r\n\r\n                                                       J.

Originally\r\nbred and preserved for fighting purposes, his size was increased by\r\nimportations of stallions and mares from Flanders--famous now and\r\nhenceforth as the battleground of the greatest war ever waged. In the\r\ndays when heavy armour was worn the cavalry horse could hardly be too\r\nstout, and at that time ploughing was performed by oxen; but there\r\ncame a day when the English knights discarded their coats of mail and\r\nthenceforward sought for light-legged mounts. This gave the horses bred\r\nin “the Shires” a chance to distinguish themselves as draught horses,\r\nfor which their width of chest, short legs, and strong back were well\r\nadapted: so the War Horse of the olden days became the Old English Cart\r\nHorse.\r\n\r\nFarmers--particularly Robert Bakewell--discovered that they could do\r\ndouble, or treble, the quantity of ploughing with a pair of these\r\nheavy horses that they could with an ox team; therefore draught horses\r\nsuperseded bullocks for agricultural and haulage purposes, which meant\r\nthat they were bred for weight and substance, the biggest and heaviest\r\nbeing regarded as the best.\r\n\r\nPedigrees of these massive animals were kept by a few progressive\r\nbreeders from the year 1800, at least; therefore it was not difficult\r\nto compile a stud book for this Old English breed when a society, to\r\nprotect its interests, and promote its breeding, was formed in 1878\r\nby a body of admirers, among whom the late Sir Walter Gilbey was\r\nconspicuous. Included were also the Earl of Ellesmere, Earl Spencer,\r\nLord Wantage, Lord Egerton of Tatton, the Hon. Edward Coke, Mr.\r\nChandos Pole-Gell, Mr. Anthony Hamond, and Messrs. George and Frederic\r\nStreet, while H.R.H. the Prince of Wales (King Edward VII) was a keen\r\nsupporter of the Shire Horse Society from its inception.\r\n\r\nAll of those named have passed away; but not before they had seen their\r\nefforts bear rich fruit in the rapid establishment of the industry of\r\nShire Horse breeding at home, and the world-wide fame achieved by the\r\nbreed abroad, but particularly in the United States of America, to\r\nwhich country the majority of those exported have been sent.\r\n\r\nGreat changes have occurred since the Hon. E. Coke’s dispersion sale\r\nat Longford Hall, Derby, in October, 1889, this being the first of\r\nwhich the writer possesses a catalogue. It was caused by his death,\r\nand his stud manager went from thence to take charge of the Royal Stud\r\nof Shires at Sandringham for King Edward, who proved to be a very\r\nsuccessful breeder. Two champion mares, Gloaming and Solace, were bred,\r\nand more than one successful sale held at Sandringham in the ’nineties\r\nof last century, a decade during which it became the fashion for\r\nlandowners and wealthy men to own a stud of Shires so that they almost\r\ntumbled over each other to secure the most notable specimens for their\r\nstuds. (The last sale of King Edward’s Shires was held at Wolferton in\r\n1907.) The result was a reign of high prices which led many farmers\r\nto believe that Shire Horse breeding was beyond the reach of their\r\npockets. Stud sales to the number of ten or twelve were held each year\r\nfrom 1890 to 1902, when the total was fourteen and the number of Shires\r\nsold 583, after which they began to dwindle till the past year of 1914,\r\nduring which there was not a single home sale.\r\n\r\nTo an outsider this might be taken to prove that the love and\r\nenthusiasm for the Old English breed had fizzled out, that the Shire\r\nhad been “weighed in the balances and found wanting.” Nothing could be\r\nfurther from the truth. The last home sale held was the most successful\r\nthat ever took place. Thirty-two animals, including several yearlings,\r\naveraged £454 each at Lord Rothschild’s sale on February 14th, 1913,\r\none two-year-old colt, Champion’s Goalkeeper, making the record price\r\nfor a Shire of 4,100 guineas. After this one may well wonder why such\r\na good method of selling has been abandoned. The chief reason is that\r\nthe industry is no longer confined to those who live in mansions, or\r\nthink--financially--in thousands. It has become part of the routine of\r\nhundreds of English tenant farmers to rear Shire horses, and as they\r\nhave only a few animals to offer at one time the Repository Sale has\r\nsuperseded the Home gathering, helpful though these fraternal meetings\r\nhave always proved to the breed’s interests.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, most of those who held sales have gone the way of\r\nall flesh, but besides those already named may be mentioned Sir P. A.\r\nMuntz, Lord Llangattock, Mr. John Parnell, Mr. Fred Crisp, Mr. Philo L.\r\nMills, Mr. James Eadie, Mr. Arthur Ransom, and Mr. J. A. Barrs. All of\r\nthese were buyers, breeders, and exhibitors of the best in their day,\r\ntogether with others too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\nThe loss of these supporters has, however, been made good by new ones,\r\nmore numerous, if less influential; therefore the Shire breeding\r\nindustry has never been on a broader base than it is to-day.\r\n\r\nThese lines are being written when horses are in greater demand for\r\nwar purposes than they have ever been before in the world’s history,\r\nand although the Shire has for generations been transformed into a\r\npeace, rather than a war, horse he has not escaped the notice of the\r\narmy buyer. We have it on the best authority--that of the official\r\nauctioneer to the Shire Horse Society--that “many a pure-bred Shire\r\nmare and gelding are now pulling heavy guns and transport waggons in\r\nFrance and Belgium, besides which nearly all the best gunners are by\r\nShire stallions.”\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to point out that the best Shires of this\r\nperiod weigh over one ton, and to pull weight you must have weighty\r\nanimals; therefore these massive modern cart horses are just as useful\r\nin hauling heavy guns, the most effective weapons in modern warfare, as\r\ntheir ancestors were in carrying the bold British knights cased from\r\nhead to foot in steel armour.\r\n\r\nBut war, though it lasts long--too long--comes to an end, and when this\r\none does horses will be wanted in thousands to make up for those lost\r\nby the eight or nine nations now fighting for their existence.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly clear that the great studs of Shires as they existed\r\na few years ago are being dispersed. Very few breeders of the present\r\ntime could have sixty high class animals paraded, as the late Lord\r\nEllesmere did for the benefit of visitors to the Worsley show in\r\nAugust, 1889; but scores of farmers could muster a team or two of good\r\nShire mares; therefore it is obvious that, whatever the future of the\r\nShire may be, English farmers will do much towards shaping it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFOUNDING A STUD\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this little book is intended for farmers more than for stud owners,\r\na better heading for this chapter would have been “Selecting the Dams,”\r\nfor without sound, useful mares no breeder can hope to achieve success\r\nwith the horses he breeds.\r\n\r\nIt has been possible to grade up one’s old stock of mares by using\r\nregistered stallions until they were eligible for the Stud Book; but\r\nthis is too tedious a course to recommend in these days; moreover, the\r\ndemand for draught mares is now so keen that the difference in the\r\nprice of a pedigree and a common non-pedigree mare is scarcely worth\r\nconsidering. Therefore the beginner who wishes to breed pedigree Shires\r\nshould dispose of his unregistered mares to re-invest his money in\r\nfemales which are worth mating with a really good sire, so that the\r\nfull benefits of the industry may be more quickly forthcoming.\r\n\r\nOf course there is a wide range of choice in Shire mares; consequently\r\nthere is plenty of scope for the skill and judgment of the purchaser.\r\nThose which are fashionably bred, perfectly sound and likely to make\r\nprize winners usually realize high prices, while prizes already won add\r\nconsiderably to the market value of any Shire, male or female.\r\n\r\nOne must decide according to his means whether he will launch out and\r\nbuy one or two of the most famous mares to be obtained, or whether he\r\nwill proceed cautiously, and with as little outlay as possible, by\r\npicking up useful specimens as they come under his notice; but it may\r\nbe pointed out that the man who attends sales and gives sensational\r\nprices advertises himself, thus getting a more favourable start than\r\nthe plodder.\r\n\r\nThe initial, or foundation, stock, whatever its cost, should be\r\nfree from hereditary unsoundness, otherwise disappointment will be\r\nencountered in the offspring.\r\n\r\nIt is much more easy to find sound Shires now than it was in the early\r\nyears of the Shire Horse Society, when the rejections for unsoundness\r\nwere very numerous, as the following extract from a show report of the\r\npast will prove:--“The judges selected ten horses to be sent out for\r\nveterinary inspection in the hope, vain though it proved to be, that at\r\nleast half of them would be again found in the ring with a certificate\r\nof soundness, so that no difficulty would be experienced in securing\r\nsufficient sound animals to which they could award the three prizes and\r\nthe reserve number. Not so, however; and the stewards were compelled to\r\nseek in the boxes for other horses to be sent out for examination in\r\norder that the rosettes might be placed.”\r\n\r\nUnsoundness on such a scale has long ceased to exist, largely through\r\nthe efforts of the Shire Horse Society in sticking to their rule of\r\ngiving prizes and commendations to sound animals only.\r\n\r\nThis does not imply that unsoundness cannot be found in the Shires of\r\nto-day. Unfortunately it is still possible to buy a mare, or use a\r\nstallion, with undesirable and readily inherited complaints; therefore\r\nit is very necessary for farmers--who wish to make their Shires do a\r\nshare towards paying the rent--to discriminate between a sound and an\r\nunsound horse, or mare, or to decide for himself whether to take or\r\nrefuse a blemished animal. There are many of the latter which often\r\nprove a good investment, and as a veterinary surgeon cannot always\r\nbe found at a moment’s notice it is desirable for breeders to make\r\nthemselves acquainted with the conformation of a sound and perfectly\r\nmoulded animal, so as to be able to rely on one’s own judgment when\r\nbuying or selling.\r\n\r\nShire Horse history has proved that the purchase of one sound mare with\r\ngood back breeding has led to fame and fortune, a fact which should not\r\nbe forgotten when home breeding is being embarked upon or extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SELECTION OF SIRES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of mating is one of great importance in the breeding of\r\nany class of live stock, hence the necessity of rejecting a commonplace\r\nsire whether he is to be purchased or only patronized for nominations.\r\n\r\nThe cheap sire is common enough even in these days, and the fact that\r\nhis services cost little gives him a popularity altogether unmerited\r\nand very injurious to the best interests of Shire breeding. Quite\r\nrecently I saw twenty quarters of wheat delivered by a small farmer\r\nfrom whom it was purchased. In one of the carts I was surprised to find\r\na five-year-old stallion, light in bone, pale chestnut in colour, and\r\nquite small--just the sort to haul guns or baggage to “the front” at\r\nthe present time, but obviously unfit to serve a mare if a weighty cart\r\nhorse was expected as the result. Yet the owner claimed to have got\r\na lot of mares to this horse for the past two seasons. This sort of\r\nthing going on all over the country, naturally lowers the standard. A\r\nfarmer saves a yearling colt because he “likes the look of it.” At two\r\nyears old he uses him on his own mares and invites his neighbours to\r\nsend theirs, the terms being something like £1 each mare, or, perhaps,\r\n“No colt, no pay,” and £1 10_s._ if the mare proves to be in foal.\r\n\r\nSuch a system of breeding may help to increase the horse population,\r\nand those bred in this haphazard fashion may find a ready market while\r\na great war is in progress, but it is not Shire breeding in the true\r\nsense; therefore a farmer who possesses even a useful mare should\r\nnot object to paying a reasonable service fee, or, if he uses his\r\nneighbour’s horse, he should at least ascertain if he is sound and of\r\ngood parentage.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Shire Horse Society is to “improve the Old English\r\nBreed of Cart Horses.” It has been carried on for thirty-six years\r\nvery successfully, notwithstanding the injurious effect wrought by\r\nsuch stallions as that above mentioned, and it rests with the present\r\nmembers of the Shire Horse Society to carry on the work which, as\r\naforesaid, was so well begun and maintained by such men as the late\r\nSir Walter Gilbey, to whom all lovers of Shire Horses are indebted for\r\nhis book on “The Great Horse,” which gives the history of the breed\r\nfrom the time of the Roman Invasion till the year 1889 (when the first\r\nedition of the book appeared), at which date Shire Horse breeding had\r\nbecome a great national industry, that year having been the best on\r\nrecord for the number of export certificates granted. A second edition\r\nbrings the work up to 1899.\r\n\r\nWhen wealthy stud owners place the best of stallions within the reach\r\nof tenant farmers it is a mistake to miss the opportunity, but those\r\nless fortunately placed are now able, if they desire to do so, to\r\nprofit by the Development Grant of the State, which enables them to get\r\nmares to sound--if not front rank--stallions at low fees or by assisted\r\nnominations. That a horse breeder should be content to mate his mares\r\nwith a mongrel when it is easily possible to aim higher seems difficult\r\nto understand in these days when pedigree means so much in market\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nFor the production of geldings, fashionable blood is not essential,\r\nbut it sometimes happens that a foal of outstanding merit is bred\r\nby quite a small farmer, and if such an one is by a well-known sire\r\nof prize-winning stock, a real good price may be obtained, if the\r\ndam is only registered, so there is much to be said in favour of\r\nusing the highest type of Shire stallion, even by owners of one or\r\ntwo mares. Fortunately farmers are able to secure special terms for\r\ntheir mares from most stud owners, and there are many local societies\r\nwhich hire a real good horse and charge a smaller sum to their own\r\nmembers than to outsiders. Among such societies may be mentioned\r\nPeterborough, Welshpool, and Winslow, in all of which districts many\r\nhigh-class Shires have been bred. Then there are generous landlords\r\nwho hire a real good horse for the benefit of their tenants--although\r\nnot Shire breeders themselves--so that it is quite possible for the\r\nmajority of tenant farmers to obtain nominations to one of the best\r\nof Shire stallions if he is bent on improvement and believes in being\r\nenterprising enough to obtain it. The indifference which leads horse\r\nbreeders to use a mongrel which comes into the yard, rather than\r\nsend further afield to a better animal is inexcusable in a member of\r\nthe Shire Horse Society, neither is such an one likely to improve his\r\nfinancial position by means of his heavy horses, which large numbers of\r\nfarmers have done during the depressed times. An extra five pounds for\r\na service fee may be, and often is, fifty when the foal is sold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBREEDING FROM FILLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years it has been a debatable point whether two-year-old\r\nfillies should be bred from or not. The pros and cons have been\r\ndiscussed, and in the end Shire breeders have used their own discretion\r\non the point. Superior animals have, however, been bred from youthful\r\nparents on both sides, a notable instance being the late Lord Wantage’s\r\nLady Victoria; her sire was Prince William, the London and Royal\r\nChampion, and her dam Glow, by the London Champion Spark. She was the\r\nfirst foal of a two-year-old colt, with a two-year-old filly for her\r\ndam, yet she made a great prize-winning mare, having won first and cup\r\nin London in 1889 and championship of the Oxfordshire Show in 1890.\r\n\r\nIt may also be mentioned that Buscot Harold, the London Champion\r\nstallion of 1898, was begotten when his sire, Markeaton Royal Harold,\r\nwas but a two-year-old colt, although his dam, Aurea, was older. At two\r\nyears old he was preferred to his sire for the Elsenham Challenge Cup.\r\n\r\nThis proves that Shire breeders have been making good use of fillies\r\nfor many years, therefore the produce of a three-year-old filly\r\nneed not be rejected, neither should the nursing of a foal at that\r\nage necessarily result in a stunted or plain mare. It is, however,\r\nnecessary to grow fillies along with the aid of supplementary food and\r\nto “do” both them and their foals well while they are suckling.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the Shires of the present day do get more food\r\nand attention than they did in bygone days, when it was unnecessary\r\nto strive after showyard size, because shows did not exist in such\r\nnumbers, so that the farmer who exhibited cart horses was rarely met\r\nwith, and young horse stock were not fed to encourage size and growth.\r\nSo long as they could be put into the team at three years old and mated\r\nat four, that was considered early enough to work or to breed.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the horse population of Great Britain and Europe,\r\nif not of the whole world, is being reduced by the greatest of all\r\nwars, consequently it is desirable for Shire breeders to do their share\r\ntowards making good the shortage. If fillies are well kept from birth\r\nthey will attain size and may be mated at two years old to a young\r\nhorse, but not too early in the season. The end of May is early enough\r\nfor fillies, and a big heavy old horse should not be chosen under\r\nany circumstances. If served at the right time they are more likely\r\nto breed than fillies a year older, and it makes a lot of difference\r\nwhether a five-year-old mare has a couple of sons and daughters or even\r\none to her credit, or no offspring at all, when the profit and loss\r\naccount is being made up by a farmer.\r\n\r\nIt may be that a three-year-old cannot be got into a fat state for\r\nshow with a foal running by her side, but the prolonged rest at that\r\nage does her no harm. She will come up all right at a later period,\r\nand is more likely to make a regular breeder than if not mated till\r\nthree years old. A mare which breeds from the age of three till she\r\nis fifteen is a great help in the way of production, even if she only\r\naverages one foal in two years, which is, perhaps, as many as it is\r\nsafe to reckon on for rearing to maturity, although, of course, there\r\nare plenty of mares which have produced a good foal for ten or eleven\r\nyears in succession. They will breed till they are twenty-five, to the\r\nwriter’s knowledge, but the average age at which Shire mares breed\r\ntheir last foal must be put somewhere round fifteen.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that we have learned much in horse management since\r\nshows have become so popular, although it may be that high feeding for\r\nshow purposes has been--and is--the cause of a lower percentage of\r\nfoals among high class show animals of both sexes.\r\n\r\nTo prepare fillies for mating at two years old may be compared to\r\nfeeding for early maturity in cattle and sheep, except that many of the\r\nlatter are only grown and fattened to be killed, whereas Shires are\r\nmeant to live a long and useful life. It is, therefore, necessary to\r\nbuild up a frame with this idea in view. An outdoor life should be led,\r\nwhile the food should be both good and sufficient, as well as being\r\nsuitable.\r\n\r\nThere is no time to be wasted, and if foals are allowed to get into low\r\ncondition while being weaned, or during their first winter, they are\r\nless fit to make robust two-year-olds fit either to work or to breed,\r\nor what is more profitable, to accomplish both of these tasks together\r\nduring part of the year.\r\n\r\nIf early maturity is aimed at with any class of stock, feeding and\r\nmanagement must be of the best, therefore farmers who half starve their\r\nfoals and allow their yearlings to be wintered on a bit of hay must not\r\nexpect their two-year-olds to be well grown and in the best possible\r\ncondition for parental duties.\r\n\r\nThe situation at the present time is such that every horse-breeder\r\nshould do his best to utilize to the full the horse stock which he\r\npossesses, so that a sufficient number of horses may be obtained to\r\ncarry on the agriculture and trade of the country, both of which are\r\nlikely to require horses in large numbers in the immediate future.\r\n\r\nMares will be relatively more scarce than stallions for the reason\r\nthat the latter have not been “commandeered” for war purposes, but as\r\ngeldings have been taken in large numbers, there is, and will be, a\r\ngreat demand for workers of all grades.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances Shire breeders may serve their own interests\r\nby mating their fillies with a good young sire at two years old and\r\nkeeping them in good condition for producing a strong vigorous foal.\r\nVery few of Robert Bakewell’s remarks are recorded, but this one is,\r\n“The only way to be sure of good offspring is to have good cows as well\r\nas good bulls,” and this applies with equal, if not greater, force in\r\nthe business of horse-breeding; the sire cannot effect the whole of the\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTEAM WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nSince my very youthful days I have always been accustomed to putting\r\ncart colts into the team at two years old, a system which cannot be too\r\nstrongly advocated at the present time, when every worker in the shape\r\nof a horse is needed.\r\n\r\nThere are numbers of high-class Shires living a life of luxurious\r\nidleness to-day, for the only reason that they were never trained to\r\nwork, yet they would be quite as well in health, and more likely to\r\nbreed, if they were helping to do ploughing or almost any kind of\r\nfarm work when not actually nursing a foal or being prepared for any\r\nimportant show.\r\n\r\nWhen a Shire mare can be sold as “a good worker,” a buyer feels that he\r\nis getting something for his money, even if she fails to breed, so that\r\nthere is much to be said in favour of putting fillies into the team,\r\nand nothing against, so far as I know, unless they are over-worked,\r\nstrained, or stunted.\r\n\r\nA non-breeding mare which will not work is an impossible, or useless,\r\nsort of animal on a farm, where mere ornaments are not required,\r\nwhereas if she is a worker in all gears she is “anybody’s mare”; on the\r\nother hand, she is nobody’s if she refuses either to work or to breed.\r\n\r\nGeldings for haulage purposes are always in demand, but big powerful\r\nmares are equally useful for the same purpose, and it is much better to\r\nsell a non-breeder for the lorry than to sell her for another breeder\r\nto meet with disappointment. It is obvious that there will be a great\r\nscarcity of weighty working horses when the countries now involved in\r\nwar settle down to peaceful trades and occupations, and there is no\r\ncountry which stands to benefit more than Great Britain, which is the\r\nbest of all breeding grounds for draught horses.\r\n\r\nTo allow, what would otherwise be, a useful worker to eat the bread\r\nof idleness because it was regarded as too well bred or valuable to\r\nwear a collar is not a policy to pursue or to recommend, especially to\r\nfarmers, seeing that the arable land tenant can put a colt into the\r\nteam, between two steady horses at almost any time of the year, while\r\nthe occupiers of grass farms may easily start their young Shires as\r\nworkers by hitching them to a log of wood or some chain harrows, and\r\nafterwards work them in a roll.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, whatever, that many stallions would leave a much\r\nhigher percentage of foals if they were “broken in” during their\r\ntwo-year-old days, so that they would take naturally to work when they\r\ngrew older and could therefore be relied upon to work and thus keep\r\ndown superfluous fat. This would be far better than allowing them to\r\nspend something like nine months of the year in a box or small paddock\r\nwith nothing to do but eat.\r\n\r\nIn past times more working stallions could be found, and they\r\nwere almost invariably good stock getters, but since showing has\r\nbecome popular it is almost a general rule to keep well-bred, or\r\nprize-winning, colts quite clear of the collar lest they should work\r\nthemselves down in condition and so fail to please possible buyers on\r\nthe look-out for show candidates.\r\n\r\nA little more than twenty years ago there was an outcry against show\r\ncondition in Shires, and this is what a very eminent breeder of those\r\ndays said on the subject of fat--\r\n\r\n    “It is a matter of no consequence to any one, save their\r\n    owners, when second or third-class horses are laden with\r\n    blubber; but it is a national calamity when the best\r\n    animals--those that ought to be the proud sires and dams of\r\n    an ever-improving race--are stuffed with treacle and drugged\r\n    with poisons in order to compete successfully with their\r\n    inferiors. Hence come fever in the feet, diseased livers, fatty\r\n    degeneration of the heart, and a host of ailments that often\r\n    shorten the lives of their victims and always injure their\r\n    constitutions.”\r\n\r\nThis bears out my contention that Shires of both sexes would pay for a\r\ncourse of training in actual collar work, no matter how blue-blooded as\r\nregards ancestry or how promising for the show ring. The fact that a\r\ncolt by a London champion had been seen in the plough team, or between\r\na pair of shafts, would not detract from his value in the eyes of a\r\njudge, or prevent him from becoming a weighty and muscular horse; in\r\nfact, it would tend to the development of the arms and thighs which\r\none expects to find in a Shire stallion, and if from any cause a stud\r\nor show career is closed, a useful one at honest work may still be\r\ncarried on.\r\n\r\nWealthy stud owners can afford to pay grooms to exercise their horses,\r\nbut farmers find--and are more than ever likely to find--that it is\r\nnecessary to make the best possible use of their men; therefore,\r\nif their colts and fillies are put to work and rendered perfectly\r\ntractable, they will grow up as stallions which may be worked instead\r\nof being aimlessly exercised, while the mares can spend at least half\r\nof their lives in helping to carry on the ordinary work of the farm.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly worth while to take pains to train a young Shire,\r\nwhich is worth rearing at all, to lead from its foalhood days so that\r\nit is always approachable if required for show or sale, and these\r\nearly lessons prepare it for the time when it is old enough to put its\r\nshoulders into the collar, this being done with far less risk than it\r\nis in the case of youngsters which have been turned away and neglected\r\ntill they are three years old. The breaking in of this class of colt\r\ntakes time and strength, while the task of getting a halter on is no\r\nlight one, and the whole business of lungeing, handling, and harnessing\r\nrequires more brute force and courage than the docile animal trained in\r\ninfancy calls for.\r\n\r\nThe secret of training any horse is to keep it from knowing its own\r\nstrength; therefore, if it is taught to lead before it is strong enough\r\nto break away, and to be tied up before it can break the headcollar\r\nby hanging back it is obvious that less force is required. The horse\r\nwhich finds he can break his halter by hanging back is likely to become\r\na troublesome animal to stand tied up, while the one which throws its\r\nrider two or three times does not forget that it is possible to get a\r\nman off its back; therefore it is better and safer if they never gain\r\nsuch knowledge of their own powers.\r\n\r\nThe Shire breeding farmer ought to be able to go into his field and put\r\na halter on any animal required, from a foal to an old horse, and he\r\ncan do this if they have been treated with kindness and handled from\r\ntheir early days.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter to which many farmers should give more attention than\r\nthey do, seeing that an ill-trained show animal may lose a prize for no\r\nother reason than that its show manners are faulty, whereas those of\r\nthe nearest rival are perfect.\r\n\r\nThe writer was taught this while showing at a County Show very early in\r\nhis career. The animal he was leading was--like himself--rather badly\r\neducated, and this was noticed by one of the oldest and best judges of\r\nthat day, and this is what he whispered in his ear, “My lad, if you\r\nwould only spend your time training your horses instead of going to\r\ncricket they would do you more credit and win more prizes.” This advice\r\nI have never forgotten, and I pass it on for the benefit of those who\r\nhave yet to learn “the ropes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nREARING AND FEEDING\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years we have heard much about early maturity with\r\nall kinds of stock. Four-year-old bullocks are rarely seen in these\r\ndays, while wether sheep are being superseded by tegs. With Shire\r\nHorses there has been a considerable amount of attention paid to size\r\nin yearlings, two- and three-year-olds, which, as before stated, is\r\nequivalent to early maturity in the case of cattle and sheep. For the\r\npurpose of getting size an animal must be well fed from birth, and this\r\napplies to foals. Of course, the date of birth counts for a good deal\r\nwhen foals are shown with their dams, as it does to a less extent with\r\nyearlings, but after that age it makes very little difference whether a\r\nfoal is born in February or in May.\r\n\r\nFrom a farmer’s point of view I do not believe in getting Shire foals\r\ntoo early. They have to be housed for a lengthened period, and the\r\ndams fed on food which may be expensive. At the present time good oats\r\nare worth 30_s._ per quarter, and hay, fit for horses, at least 90_s._\r\nper ton, so that two or three months of winter feeding means a little\r\nsum added to the cost of raising a foal.\r\n\r\nThe middle of April is early enough for the average foal to arrive,\r\nand he can then make quite a good size by September if his dam is an\r\nordinarily good suckler and he contracts no ailments, such as chills\r\nor scour, to check his progress. When colts are a month old they will\r\nbegin to pick up crushed oats and bran while the dam is feeding,\r\ntherefore it is no trouble to teach them to eat from a manger.\r\n\r\nA word of caution is necessary to the inexperienced in the matter of\r\nfeeding the dam until the foal is a few days old and strong enough to\r\ntake all her milk. This is to feed the mare sparingly so as not to\r\nflush her milk while the youngster is unable to take it fast enough. Of\r\ncourse, the surplus can be milked away, as it should be if the bag is\r\ntight, but this may be neglected and then scour is often set up, which\r\na very young foal often succumbs to. It is better that the mare should\r\nhave too little than too much milk while the youngster gets fairly on\r\nhis legs.\r\n\r\nCows always have most of their milk taken away, but young lambs as well\r\nas foals often suffer through taking too much of the dam’s milk during\r\nthe first day or two of their existence.\r\n\r\nIf a foal is born during the grazing season the flow of milk can be\r\nregulated by keeping the mare in a bare pasture, or shutting her up for\r\npart of the day.\r\n\r\nSupposing that the foal survives the ills incidental to its early life,\r\nand gains in strength with the lengthening days, its first dry food\r\nwill be taken when the mare is fed, which she should be, especially\r\nif she is either a young or an old mare, while show candidates will\r\nnaturally need something more than grass. The object is to promote\r\nsteady growth and maintain good health, and it should not be forgotten\r\nthat oats are the best of all corn for horses; therefore no other kind\r\nshould be given to a foal, but on good grazing land a mare will usually\r\nmaintain herself and her foal in good condition for a good part of the\r\nsummer without manger food.\r\n\r\nIt is towards weaning time that a manger is needed, into which should\r\nbe put crushed (not whole) oats, together with an equal quantity of\r\nbran and a bit of good chaff. At the outset the mare will eat most of\r\nit, but the foal will benefit by getting richer milk and more of it,\r\nwhich he can now take without any ill effects. In time he acquires the\r\nhabit of standing up to the manger and taking his share. It is very\r\nnecessary to see that all foals eat well before they are weaned.\r\n\r\nThe cost of feeding a foal during its first winter may be roughly\r\nreckoned at ten shillings per week, which is made up as follows--\r\n\r\n                             _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n    80 lbs. of oats           6    0\r\n    56    ”    hay            2    0\r\n    28    ”    bran           1    6\r\n    28    ”    oat straw      0    9\r\n    28    ”    carrots        0    3\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the hay and all the oat straw should be fed in the form of\r\nchaff with the oats, bran and carrots (well cleaned and pulped), then\r\na very good everyday diet can be formed by mixing the whole together,\r\nand one which few horses will refuse. Of course the items are not\r\nreckoned at the extreme prices prevailing in the winter of 1914-1915,\r\nbut they could often be bought for less, so that it is a fair average.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that oats form the biggest part, for the reason\r\naforesaid, that they are better than other kinds of corn.\r\n\r\nA little long hay should be given at night--more when there is snow on\r\nthe ground--the other mixture divided into two feeds per day, morning\r\nand evening, unless showing is contemplated in the early Spring, when,\r\nof course, an extra feed will be given at mid-day.\r\n\r\nThe fashion has changed during the past few years as regards hay for\r\nhorses. Meadow hay is regarded, and rightly so, as too soft, so hard\r\nseeds are invariably chosen by grooms or owners who want value for\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nIt is quite easy to ascertain which a horse likes best by putting some\r\ngood hard mixture and equally well-gotten meadow hay side by side in\r\nfront of him. He will certainly eat that first which he likes best, and\r\nit will be found to be the harder mixture. The quantities mentioned\r\nare for foals which lie out or run on pasture.\r\n\r\nThe best place for wintering them is in a paddock or field, with a\r\nroomy shed open to the south. A yard, walled or slabbed on three sides,\r\nthe south again being open to the field, with doors wide enough to\r\nadmit a cart, is a very useful addition to the shed, as it is then\r\npossible to shut the youngsters in when necessary.\r\n\r\nBoth yard and shed should be kept littered, if straw is plentiful, but\r\nif not the shed should contain a good bedding of peat-moss litter. No\r\noverhead racks should be used, but one on the same level as the manger,\r\nso that no seeds drop out of the rack into the colt’s eyes.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that foals reared in this way are healthy and ready\r\nfor their feed, and they will often prefer to lie full length in\r\nthe open than to rest in the shed. To see them lying quite flat and\r\nfast asleep, looking as if dead, is a pretty sure sign that they are\r\nthriving. They will often snore quite loudly, so that a novice may\r\nconsider that they are ill.\r\n\r\nRock salt should be within reach for them to lick, together with good\r\nclean water. If a trough is used for the latter it should be cleaned\r\nout at intervals, and if a pond or ditch is the drinking place, there\r\nshould be a stone mouth so as to avoid stalking in the mud. A healthy\r\nhorse is a hungry horse, therefore the feed should be cleaned up before\r\nthe next is put in. This must be noted in the case of foals just\r\nweaned. Any left over should be taken away and given to older horses,\r\nso that the little ones receive a sweet and palatable meal.\r\n\r\nCondition and bloom may be obtained by adding a small quantity of\r\nboiled barley or a handful of linseed meal to the food above mentioned,\r\nwhile horses lying in should have a boiled linseed and bran mash about\r\nonce a week.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered, as before stated, that horses are not like\r\ncattle, sheep, or pigs, being fattened to be killed. They have a\r\ncomparatively long life in front of them, so that it is necessary to\r\nbuild up a good constitution. Then they may change hands many times,\r\nand if they pass from where cooked foods and condiments are largely\r\nused to where plain food is given they are apt to refuse it and lose\r\nflesh in consequence, thus leading the new owner to suppose that he\r\nhas got a bad bargain.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the pernicious system of stuffing\r\nshow-animals, and it is not often that farmers err in this direction.\r\nThey are usually satisfied with feeding their horses on sound and\r\nwholesome home-grown food without purchasing costly extras to make\r\ntheir horses into choice feeders.\r\n\r\nIt is always better for the breeder of any class of stock if the\r\nanimals he sells give satisfaction to the purchasers, and this is\r\nparticularly true of Shire horses. A doubtful breeder or one which is\r\nnot all that it should be may be fattened up and sold at more than its\r\nmarket value, but the buyer would not be likely to go to the same man\r\nif he wanted another horse, therefore it is better to gain a reputation\r\nfor honest dealing and to make every effort to keep it.\r\n\r\nIt might be here mentioned that it is not at all satisfactory to rear\r\na Shire foal by itself, even if it will stay in its paddock. It never\r\nthrives as well as when with company, and often stands with its head\r\ndown looking very mopish and dull, therefore the rearing of Shires is\r\nnot a suitable undertaking for a small holder, although he may keep\r\na good brood-mare to do most of his work and sell her foal at weaning\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a second foal a donkey is sometimes used as a\r\ncompanion to a single one, but he is a somewhat unsatisfactory\r\nplayfellow, therefore the farmer with only one had far better sell it\r\nstraight from the teat, or if he has suitable accommodation he should\r\nbuy another to lie with it and rear the two together. Of course, two\r\nwill need more food than one, but no more journeys will be required to\r\ncarry it to the manger. Care should be taken, however, to buy one quite\r\nas good, and if possible better, than the home-bred one.\r\n\r\nIf they are to make geldings the colour should match, but if for\r\nbreeding purposes the colour need not necessarily be the same. Except\r\nfor making a working gelding, however, chestnuts should be avoided. It\r\nis not a desirable colour to propagate, so one can breed enough of that\r\nshade without buying one. A remark which may be also made with regard\r\nto unsound ones, viz. that most horse-breeders get enough of them\r\nwithout buying.\r\n\r\nDuring their second summer--that is as yearlings--Shires not wanted for\r\nshow purposes should be able to do themselves well at grass, supposing\r\nthe land is of average quality and not overstocked, but if the soil\r\nis very poor it may be necessary to give a small feed once a day, of\r\nwhich pulped mangolds may form a part if they are plentiful. This extra\r\nfeeding is better than stunting the growth, and the aim is to get a big\r\nromping two-year-old colt, filly, or gelding as the case may be.\r\n\r\nColts not up to the desired standard should be operated on during their\r\nyearling days, preferably in May or June, and, as before indicated,\r\nmerit should be conspicuous in those left for stud purposes, while the\r\nback breeding on both sides counts for much in a stallion. That is why\r\nLockinge Forest King, Childwick Champion, and a few others which could\r\nbe named, proved to be such prepotent stock-getters.\r\n\r\nAfter June or July colts should be separated from fillies unless the\r\ncolts have been castrated, and they must be put inside good fences,\r\nthis being something of a puzzle to a farmer with a few paddocks and\r\npoor fences. Consequently, a second or third-rate young stallion often\r\ncauses a good deal of trouble, in fact, more than he leaves a return\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nFor the second winter the young Shires still need a bit of help. If\r\nthey are to make, or are likely to make, anything out of the common\r\nthey should be fed liberally, otherwise a feed of chaff and corn once a\r\nday will do, with a bit of hay to munch at night, but it must be good\r\nwholesome forage.\r\n\r\nDuring their second spring, or when two years old, they should be put\r\nto work as described in a former chapter, after which they are able at\r\nleast to earn their keep; the cost of rearing on the lines indicated up\r\nto this age will be found to be considerable, so that a good saleable\r\nanimal is needed to make the business a profitable one; but I have kept\r\nthe rearing of good sound Shires in view, not crocks or mongrels.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the war on the cost of feeding horses has led the Board\r\nof Agriculture and Fisheries to issue a leaflet telling horse owners\r\nof substitutes for oats. When it was written beans were relatively\r\ncheaper, so was maize, while rice-meal was recommended to form part of\r\nthe mixture, owing to its lower cost.\r\n\r\nThose who have fed horses are aware that they do not like any food\r\nwhich is of a dusty nature. It sticks in their nostrils, causing them\r\nannoyance, if not discomfort, which a horse indicates by blowing its\r\nnose frequently.\r\n\r\nAny kind of light meal should therefore be fed either with damp chaff\r\nor with pulped roots, well mixed with the feed in the manner described\r\nelsewhere. If mangolds have to be purchased at £1 per ton, they help to\r\nmake the meals more palatable. The farmer who grows a variety of corn\r\nand roots is usually able to prepare and blend his own foods so as to\r\nmake a diet on which horses will thrive although oats are scarce.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland boiled swedes or turnips are largely used for farm horses,\r\nbut coal and labour are now scarce as well as horse corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCARE OF THE FEET\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no part of a Shire to which more attention should be paid\r\nthan the feet, and it is safe to say that the foot of the present-day\r\ncart-horse is infinitely better than were those of his ancestors of\r\nforty, or even twenty, years ago. The shape as well as the size has\r\nbeen improved till the donkey-shaped hoof is rarely met with, at least\r\nin show animals of this breed.\r\n\r\nIt is always advisable to keep the feet of foals, yearlings, and\r\ntwo-year-olds attended to whether they are required for show or not,\r\nand if they have their feet quietly picked up and the edges rasped, the\r\nheels being lowered a little when necessary, the hoof is prevented from\r\nbreaking, and a better and more durable hoof well repays the trouble,\r\nmoreover the task of fixing the first set of shoes--which used to be\r\nquite a tough job for the smith when the colts were neglected till\r\nthey were three years old--is rendered quite easy.\r\n\r\nExcept for travelling on the road, or when required for show, there is\r\nno advantage in keeping shoes on young Shires, therefore they should be\r\ntaken off when lying idle, or if worked only on soft ground shoes are\r\nnot actually necessary.\r\n\r\nWhere several are lying together, or even two, those with shoes on may\r\ncause ugly wounds on their fellows, whereas a kick with the naked hoof\r\nis not often serious. There is also a possibility that colts turned\r\naway to grass with their shoes on will have the removing neglected, and\r\nthus get corns, so that the shoeless hoof is always better for young\r\nShires so long as it is sound and normal. If not, of course, it should\r\nbe treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn a dry summer, when the ground is very hard, it may be advisable\r\nto use tips so that the foot may be preserved, this being especially\r\nnecessary in the case of thin and brittle hoofs.\r\n\r\nFor growing and preserving good strong feet in Shire horses clay land\r\nseems to answer best, seeing that those reared on heavy-land farms\r\nalmost invariably possess tough horn on which a shoe can be affixed to\r\nlast till it wears out.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of improving weak feet in young Shires turning them out\r\nin cool clay land may be recommended, taking care to assist the growth\r\nby keeping the heels open so that the frog comes into contact with the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWeakness in the feet has been regarded, and rightly so, as a bad fault\r\nin a Shire stallion, therefore good judges have always been particular\r\nto put bottoms first when judging. Horses of all kinds have to travel,\r\nwhich they cannot do satisfactorily for any length of time if their\r\nfeet are ill-formed or diseased, and it should be borne in mind that\r\na good or a bad foot can be inherited. “No foot, no horse,” is an old\r\nand true belief. During the past few years farmers have certainly paid\r\nmore attention to the feet of their young stock because more of them\r\nare shown, the remarks of judges and critics having taught them that\r\na good top cannot atone for poor bottoms, seeing that Shires are not\r\nlike stationary engines, made to do their work standing. They have to\r\nspend a good part of their lives on hard roads or paved streets, where\r\ncontracted or tender feet quickly come to grief, therefore those who\r\nwant to produce saleable Shires should select parents with the approved\r\ntype of pedals, and see that those of the offspring do not go wrong\r\nthrough neglect or mismanagement.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that a set of good feet often places an otherwise\r\nmoderate Shire above one which has other good points but lacks this\r\nessential; therefore all breeders of Shires should devote time and\r\nattention to the production of sound and saleable bottoms, remembering\r\nthe oft-quoted line, “The top may come, the bottom never.” In diseases\r\nof the feet it is those in front which are the most certain to go\r\nwrong, and it is these which judges and buyers notice more particularly.\r\n\r\nIf fever manifests itself it is generally in the fore feet; while\r\nside-bone, ring-bone, and the like are incidental to the front coronets.\r\n\r\nClay land has been spoken of for rearing Shires, but there are various\r\nkinds of soil in England, all of which can be utilized as a breeding\r\nground for the Old English type of cart-horses.\r\n\r\nIn Warwickshire Shires are bred on free-working red land, in Herts a\r\nchalky soil prevails, yet champions abound there; while very light\r\nsandy farms are capable of producing high-class Shires if the farmer\r\nthereof sets his mind on getting them, and makes up for the poorness or\r\nunsuitability of the soil by judicious feeding and careful management.\r\n\r\nIt may be here stated that an arable farm can be made to produce a\r\ngood deal more horse forage than one composed wholly of pasture-land,\r\ntherefore more horses can be kept on the former.\r\n\r\nHeavy crops of clovers, mixtures, lucerne, etc., can be grown and mown\r\ntwice in the season, whereas grass can only be cut once. Oats and\r\noat straw are necessary, or at least desirable, for the rearing of\r\nhorses, so are carrots, golden tankard, mangold, etc; consequently an\r\narable-land farmer may certainly be a Shire horse breeder.\r\n\r\nThis is getting away from the subject of feet, however, and it may be\r\nreturned to by saying that stable management counts for a good deal in\r\nthe growth and maintenance of a sound and healthy hoof.\r\n\r\nGood floors kept clean, dry litter, a diet in which roots appear,\r\nmoving shoes at regular intervals, fitting them to the feet, and not\r\nrasping the hoof down to fit a too narrow shoe, may be mentioned as\r\naids in retaining good feet.\r\n\r\nAs stated, the improvement in this particular has been very noticeable\r\nsince the writer’s first Shire Horse Show (in 1890), but perfection\r\nhas not yet been reached, therefore it remains for the breeders of the\r\npresent and the future to strive after it.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when exhibitors of “Agricultural” horses stopped the\r\ncracks and crevices in their horses’ feet with something in the nature\r\nof putty, which is proved by reading a report of the Leeds Royal of\r\n1861, where “the judges discovered the feet of one of the heavy horses\r\nto be stopped with gutta-percha and pitch.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nHOW TO SHOW A SHIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nA few remarks on the above subject will not come amiss, at least to\r\nthe uninitiated, for it is tolerably certain that, other things being\r\nequal, the candidate for honours which makes the best show when it is\r\nactually before the judges stands the first chance of securing the\r\nhonours.\r\n\r\nIt must not be expected that a colt can be fetched out of a grass field\r\none day and trained well enough to show himself off creditably in the\r\nring the next; and a rough raw colt makes both itself and its groom\r\nlook small. Training properly takes time and patience, and it is best\r\nto begin early with the process, from birth for choice. The lessons\r\nneed not, and certainly should not, be either long or severe at the\r\noutset, but just enough to teach the youngster what is required of him.\r\nWhen teaching horses to stand at “attention” they should not be made to\r\nstretch themselves out as if they were wanted to reach from one side\r\nof the ring to the other, neither should they be allowed to stand like\r\nan elephant on a tub. They should be taught to stand squarely on all\r\nfours in a becoming and businesslike way. The best place for the groom\r\nwhen a horse is wanted to stand still is exactly in front and facing\r\nthe animal. The rein is usually gripped about a foot from the head.\r\nMares can often be allowed a little more “head,” but with stallions\r\nit may be better to take hold close to the bit, always remembering to\r\nhave the loop end of the rein in the palm, in case he suddenly rears\r\nor plunges. The leader should “go with his horse,” or keep step with\r\nhim, but need not “pick up” in such a manner as to make it appear to\r\nbystanders that he is trying to make up for the shortcomings of his\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nBoth horse and man want to practise the performance in the home paddock\r\na good many times before perfection can be reached, and certainly\r\na little time thus spent is better than making a bad show when the\r\ncritical moment arrives that they are both called out to exhibit\r\nthemselves before a crowd of critics.\r\n\r\nIf well trained the horse will respond to the call of the judges with\r\nonly a word, and no whip or stick need be used to get it through the\r\nrequired walks and trots, or back to its place in the rank.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of men who would profit by giving a little time to\r\ntraining young horse stock, and that is the farmers who breed but do\r\nnot show. Of course, “professional show-men” (as they are sometimes\r\ncalled) prefer to “buy their gems in the rough,” and put on the polish\r\nthemselves, and then take the profits for so doing. But why should not\r\nthe breeder make his animals show to their very best, and so get a\r\nbetter price into his own pocket?\r\n\r\nFinally, I would respectfully suggest that if some of the horse show\r\nsocieties were to have a horse-showing competition, _i.e._ give prizes\r\nto the men who showed out a horse in the best manner, it would be both\r\ninteresting and instructive to horse lovers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE SHIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a breed of comparatively heavy horses existed in\r\nBritain at the time of the Roman Invasion, when Queen Boadicea’s\r\nwarriors met Cæsar’s fighting men (who were on foot) in war chariots\r\ndrawn by active but powerful horses, remarkable--as Sir Walter Gilbey’s\r\nbook on “The Great Horse” says--for “strength, substance, courage and\r\ndocility.”\r\n\r\nThese characteristics have been retained and improved upon all down the\r\nages since. The chariot with its knives, or blades, to mow down the\r\nenemy was superseded by regiments of cavalry, the animals ridden being\r\nthe Old English type of War Horse. In those days it was the lighter or\r\nsecond-rate animals, what we may call “the culls,” which were left for\r\nagricultural purposes. The English knight, when clad in armour, weighed\r\nsomething like 4 cwt., therefore a weedy animal would have sunk under\r\nsuch a burden.\r\n\r\nThis evidently forced the early breeders to avoid long backs by\r\nbreeding from strong-loined, deep-ribbed and well coupled animals,\r\nseeing that slackness meant weakness and, therefore, worthlessness for\r\nwar purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that a long-backed, light-middled mount with\r\na weight of 4 cwt. on his back would simply double up when stopped\r\nsuddenly by the rider to swing his battle axe at the head of his\r\nantagonist, so we find from pictures and plates that the War Horse of\r\nthose far-off days was wide and muscular in his build, very full in his\r\nthighs, while the saddle in use reached almost from the withers to the\r\nhips, thus proving that the back was short.\r\n\r\nThere came a time, however, when speed and mobility were preferred to\r\nmere weight. The knight cast away his armour and selected a lighter and\r\nfleeter mount than the War Horse of the ancient Britons.\r\n\r\nThe change was, perhaps, began at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314.\r\nIt is recorded that Robert Bruce rode a “palfrey” in that battle, on\r\nwhich he dodged the charges of the ponderous English knights, and\r\nhe took a very heavy toll, not only of English warriors but of their\r\nmassive horses; therefore it is not unreasonable to suppose that some\r\nof the latter were used for breeding purposes, and thus helped to build\r\nup the Scottish, or Clydesdale, breed of heavy horses; but what was\r\nEngland’s loss became Scotland’s gain, in that the Clydesdale breed had\r\na class devoted to it at the Highland Society’s Show in 1823, whereas\r\nhis English relative, “the Shire,” did not receive recognition by the\r\nRoyal Agricultural Society of England till 1883, sixty years later. As\r\na War Horse the British breed known as “The Great Horse” seems to have\r\nbeen at its best between the Norman Conquest, 1066, and the date of\r\nBannockburn above-mentioned, owing to the fact that the Norman nobles,\r\nwho came over with William the Conqueror, fought on horseback, whereas\r\nthe Britons of old used to dismount out of their chariots, and fight on\r\nfoot. The Battle of Hastings was waged between Harold’s English Army of\r\ninfantry-men and William the Conqueror’s Army of horsemen, ending in a\r\nvictory for the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Flemish horses thus became known to English horse breeders, and\r\nthey were certainly used to help lay the foundation of the Old English\r\nbreed of cart horses.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that horses with substance were used for drawing chariots\r\nat the Roman invasion in the year 55 B.C., but no great development\r\nin horse-breeding took place in England till the Normans proved that\r\nwarriors could fight more effectively on horseback than on foot. After\r\nthis the noblemen of England appear to have set store by their horses,\r\nconsequently the twelfth and thirteenth centuries may be regarded\r\nas the age in which Britain’s breed of heavy horses became firmly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIn Sir Walter Gilbey’s book is a quotation showing that “Cart Horses\r\nfit for the dray, the plough, or the chariot” were on sale at\r\nSmithfield (London) every Friday, the extract being made from a book\r\nwritten about 1154, and from the same source we learn that during the\r\nreign of King John, 1199-1216, a hundred stallions “of large stature”\r\nwere imported from the low countries--Flanders and Holland.\r\n\r\nPassing from this large importation to the time of the famous Robert\r\nBakewell of Dishley (1726-1795), we find that he too went to Flanders\r\nfor stock to improve his cart horses, but instead of returning\r\nwith stallions he bought mares, which he mated with his stallions,\r\nthese being of the old black breed peculiar--in those days--to\r\nLeicestershire. There is no doubt that the interest taken by this great\r\nbreed improver in the Old English type of cart horse had an effect far\r\nmore important than it did in the case of the Longhorn breed of cattle,\r\nseeing that this has long lost its popularity, whereas that of the\r\nShire horse has been growing and widening from that day to this.\r\n\r\nBakewell was the first English stockbreeder to let his stud animals for\r\nthe season, and although his greatest success was achieved with the\r\nDishley or “New Leicester” sheep, he also carried on the system with\r\nLonghorn bulls and his cart horses, which were described as “Bakewell’s\r\nBlacks.”\r\n\r\nThat his horses had a reputation is proved by the fact that in 1785\r\nhe had the honour of exhibiting a black horse before King George III.\r\nat St. James’s Palace, but another horse named “K,” said by Marshall\r\nto have died in that same year, 1785, at the age of nineteen years,\r\nwas described by the writer just quoted as a better animal than that\r\ninspected by His Majesty the King. From the description given he\r\nappears to have had a commanding forehand and to have carried his head\r\nso high that his ears stood perpendicularly over his fore feet, as\r\nBakewell held that the head of a cart horse should. It can hardly be\r\nquestioned that he was a believer in weight, seeing that his horses\r\nwere “thick and short in body, on very short legs.”\r\n\r\nThe highest price he is credited with getting for the hire of a\r\nstallion for a season is 150 guineas, while the service fee at home is\r\nsaid to have been five guineas, which looks a small amount compared\r\nwith the 800 guineas obtained for the use of his ram “Two Pounder” for\r\na season.\r\n\r\nWhat is of more importance to Shire horse breeders, however, is the\r\nfact that Robert Bakewell not only improved and popularized the Shire\r\nhorse of his day, but he instituted the system of letting out sires\r\nfor the season, which has been the means of placing good sires before\r\nfarmers, thus enabling them to assist in the improvement which has made\r\nsuch strides since the formation of the Shire Horse Society in 1878.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to note that Bakewell’s horses were said to be\r\n“perfectly gentle, willing workers, and of great power.” He held that\r\nbad pullers were made so by bad management. He used two in front of\r\na Rotherham plough, the quantity ploughed being “four acres a day.”\r\nSurely a splendid advertisement for the Shire as a plough horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEMISH BLOOD\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that Flanders has been very much in the public eye\r\nfor the past few months owing to its having been converted into a vast\r\nbattlefield, it is interesting to remember that we English farmers of\r\nto-day owe at least something of the size, substance and soundness of\r\nour Shire horses to the Flemish horse breeders of bygone days. Bakewell\r\nis known to have obtained marvellous results among his cattle and sheep\r\nby means of in-breeding, therefore we may assume that he would not have\r\ngone to the Continent for an outcross for his horses unless he regarded\r\nsuch a step beneficial to the breed.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded by George Culley that a certain Earl of Huntingdon had\r\nreturned from the Low Countries--where he had been Ambassador--with a\r\nset of black coach horses, mostly stallions. These were used by the\r\nTrentside farmers, and without a doubt so impressed Bakewell as to\r\ninduce him to pay a visit to the country whence they came.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from the history of the Shire to that of the Clydesdale it\r\nwill be found that the imported Flemish stallions are credited by the\r\nmost eminent authorities, with adding size to the North British breed\r\nof draught horses.\r\n\r\nThe Dukes of Hamilton were conspicuous for their interest in horse\r\nbreeding. One was said to have imported six black Flemish stallions--to\r\ncross with the native mares--towards the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, while the sixth duke, who died in 1758, imported one, which he\r\nnamed “Clyde.”\r\n\r\nThis is notable, because it proves that both the English and Scotch\r\nbreeds have obtained size from the very country now devastated by war.\r\n\r\nIt may be here mentioned that one of the greatest lovers and breeders\r\nof heavy horses during the nineteenth century was schooled on the Duke\r\nof Hamilton’s estate, and he was eminently successful in blending the\r\nShire and Clydesdale breeds to produce prizewinners and sires which\r\nhave done much towards building up the modern Clydesdale.\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Lawrence Drew, of Merryton, who, like Mr. Robert Bakewell,\r\nhad the distinction of exhibiting a stallion (named Prince of Wales)\r\nbefore Royalty.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that he (Mr. Drew) bought many Shires in the Midland\r\nCounties of England. So keen was his judgment that he would “spot a\r\nwinner” from a railway carriage, and has been known to alight at the\r\nnext station and make the journey back to the farm where he saw the\r\nlikely animal.\r\n\r\nOn at least one occasion the farmer would not sell the best by itself,\r\nso the enthusiast bought the whole team, which he had seen at plough\r\nfrom the carriage window on the railway.\r\n\r\nQuite the most celebrated Shire stallion purchased by Mr. Drew in\r\nEngland was Lincolnshire Lad 1196, who died in his possession in 1878.\r\nThis horse won several prizes in Derbyshire before going north, and he\r\nalso begot Lincolnshire Lad II. 1365, the sire of Harold 3703, Champion\r\nof the London Show of 1887, who in turn begot Rokeby Harold (Champion\r\nin London as a yearling, a three-year-old and a four-year-old),\r\nMarkeaton Royal Harold, the Champion of 1897, and of Queen of the\r\nShires, the Champion mare of the same year, 1897, and numerous other\r\ncelebrities. A great mare, bought by Mr. Drew in Derbyshire, was Flora,\r\nby Lincolnshire Lad, who became the dam of Pandora, a great winner, and\r\nthe dam of Prince of Clay, Handsome Prince, and Pandora’s Prince, all\r\nof which were Clydesdale stallions and stock-getters of the first rank.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence to show that heavy horses from other countries than\r\nFlanders were imported, but this much is perfectly clear, that the\r\nFlemish breed was selected to impart size, therefore, if we give honour\r\nwhere it is due, these “big and handsome” black stallions that we read\r\nof deserve credit for helping to build up the breed of draught horses\r\nin Britain, which is universally known as the Shire, its distinguishing\r\nfeature being that it is the heaviest breed in existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFACTS AND FIGURES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Show of 1890 was a remarkable one in more than one sense.\r\nThe entries totalled 646 against 447 the previous year. This led to the\r\nadoption of measures to prevent exhibitors from making more than two\r\nentries in one class. The year 1889 holds the record, so far, for the\r\nnumber of export certificates granted by the Shire Horse Society, the\r\ntotal being 1264 against 346 in 1913, yet Shires were much dearer in\r\nthe latter year than in the former.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago the number of three-year-old stallions shown in\r\nLondon was 161, while two-year-olds totalled 134, hence the rule of\r\ncharging double fees for more than two entries from one exhibitor.\r\n\r\nAnother innovation was the passing of a rule that every animal entered\r\nfor show should be passed by a veterinary surgeon, this being the form\r\nof certificate drawn up:--\r\n\r\n    “I hereby certify that ________ entered by Mr. ________ for\r\n    exhibition at the Shire Horse Society’s London Show, 1891,\r\n    has been examined by me and, in my opinion, is free from the\r\n    following hereditary diseases, viz: Roaring (whistling),\r\n    Ringbone, Unsound Feet, Navicular Disease, Spavin, Cataract,\r\n    Sidebone, Shivering.”\r\n\r\nThese alterations led to a smaller show in 1891 (which was the first at\r\nwhich the writer had the honour of leading round a candidate, exhibited\r\nby a gentleman who subsequently bred several London winners, and who\r\nserved on the Council of the Shire Horse Society). But to hark back to\r\nthe 1890 Show. The Champion Stallion was Mr. A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s\r\n(now Lord Redesdale) Hitchin Conqueror, one of whose sons, I’m the\r\nSort the Second, made £1000 at the show after winning third prize; the\r\nsecond-prize colt in the same class being sold for £700.\r\n\r\nThe Champion mare was Starlight, then owned by Mr. R. N.\r\nSutton-Nelthorpe, but sold before the 1891 Show, at the Scawby sale,\r\nfor 925 guineas to Mr. Fred Crisp--who held a prominent place in the\r\nShire Horse world for several years. Starlight rewarded him by winning\r\nChampion prize both in 1891 and 1892, her three successive victories\r\nbeing a record in championships for females at the London Show. Others\r\nhave won highest honours thrice, but, so far, not in successive years.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the number of members of the Shire Horse Society was 1615, the\r\namount given in prizes being just over £700. A curious thing about that\r\n1890 meeting, with its great entry, was that it resulted in a loss of\r\n£1300 to the Society, but in those days farmers did not attend in their\r\nthousands as they do now.\r\n\r\nThe sum spent in 1914 was £2230, the number of members being 4200, and\r\nthe entries totalling 719, a similar sum being offered, at the time\r\nthis is being written, for distribution at the Shire Horse Show of\r\n1915, which will be held when this country has, with the help of her\r\nAllies, waged a great war for seven months, yet before it had been\r\ncarried on for seven days show committees in various parts of the\r\ncountry cancelled their shows, being evidently under the impression\r\nthat “all was in the dust.” With horses of all grades at a premium, any\r\nmethod of directing the attention of farmers and breeders generally\r\nto the scarcity that is certain to exist is justifiable, particularly\r\nthat which provides for over two thousand pounds being spent among\r\nmembers of what is admitted to be the most flourishing breed society in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nAt the London Show of 1895 two classes for geldings were added to\r\nthe prize schedule, making fifteen in all, but even with twenty-two\r\ngeldings the total was only 489, so that it was a small show, its most\r\nnotable feature being that Mr. A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s Minnehaha won\r\nthe Challenge Cup for mares and died later.\r\n\r\nUp till the Show of 1898 both stallions and mares commenced with the\r\neldest, so that Class I was for stallions ten years old and upwards,\r\nthe yearlings coming last, the mare classes following in like order.\r\nBut for the 1898 Show a desirable change was made by putting the\r\nyearlings first, and following on with classes in the order of age. At\r\nthis show, 1898, Sir Alexander Henderson performed the unique feat of\r\nwinning not only the male and female Challenge Cups, but also the other\r\ntwo, so that he had four cup winners, three of them being sire, dam,\r\nand son, viz. Markeaton Royal Harold, Aurea, and Buscot Harold, this\r\nmade the victory particularly noteworthy. The last named also succeeded\r\nin winning champion honours in 1899 and 1900, thus rivalling Starlight.\r\nThe cup-winning gelding, Bardon Extraordinary, had won similar honours\r\nthe previous year for Mr. W. T. Everard, his owner in 1898 being Mr.\r\nJames Eadie. He possessed both weight and quality, and it is doubtful\r\nif a better gelding has been exhibited since. He was also cup winner\r\nagain in 1899, consequently he holds the record for geldings at the\r\nLondon Show.\r\n\r\nIt should have been mentioned that the system of giving breeders prizes\r\nwas introduced at the Show of 1896, the first prizes being reduced\r\nfrom £25 to £20 in the case of stallions, and from £20 to £15 in those\r\nfor mares, to allow the breeder of the first prize animal £10 in each\r\nbreeding class, and the breeder of each second-prize stallion or mare\r\n£5, the latter sum being awarded to breeders of first-prize geldings.\r\nThis was a move in the right direction, and certainly gave the Shire\r\nHorse Society and its London Show a lift up in the eyes of farmers\r\nwho had bred Shires but had not exhibited. Since then they have never\r\nlost their claim on any good animal they have bred, that is why they\r\nflock to the Show in February from all parts of England, and follow the\r\njudging with such keen interest; there is money in it.\r\n\r\nThis Show of 1896 was, therefore, one of the most important ever held.\r\nIt marked the beginning of a more democratic era in the history of the\r\nGreat Horse. The sum of £1142 was well spent.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1900 the prize money had reached a total of £1322, the\r\nclasses remaining as from 1895 with seven for stallions, six for\r\nmares, and two for geldings. The next year, 1901, another class, for\r\nmares 16 hands 2 inches and over, was added, and also another class\r\nfor geldings, resulting in a further rise to £1537 in prize money.\r\nThe sensation of this Show was the winning of the Championship by new\r\ntenant-farmer exhibitors, Messrs. J. and M. Walwyn, with an unknown\r\ntwo-year-old colt, Bearwardcote Blaze. This was a bigger surprise than\r\nthe success of Rokeby Harold as a yearling in 1893, as he had won\r\nprizes for his breeder, Mr. A. C. Rogers, and for Mr. John Parnell\r\n(at Ashbourne) before getting into Lord Belper’s possession, therefore\r\ngreat things were expected of him, whereas the colt Bearwardcote Blaze\r\nwas a veritable “dark horse.” Captain Heaton, of Worsley, was one of\r\nthe judges, and subsequently purchased him for Lord Ellesmere.\r\n\r\nThe winning of the Championship by a yearling colt was much commented\r\non at the time (1893), but he was altogether an extraordinary colt. The\r\ncritics of that day regarded him as the best yearling Shire ever seen.\r\nSaid one, “We breed Shire horses every day, but a colt like this comes\r\nonly once in a lifetime.” Fortunately I saw him both in London and at\r\nthe Chester Royal, where he was also Champion, my interest being all\r\nthe greater because he was bred in Bucks, close to where I “sung my\r\nfirst song.”\r\n\r\nOf two-year-old champions there have been at least four, viz. Prince\r\nWilliam, in 1885; Buscot Harold, 1898; Bearwardcote Blaze, 1901; and\r\nChampion’s Goalkeeper, 1913.\r\n\r\nThree-year-olds have also won supreme honours fairly often. Those\r\nwithin the writer’s recollection being Bury Victor Chief, in 1892,\r\nafter being first in his class for the two previous years, and reserve\r\nchampion in 1891; Rokeby Harold in 1895, who was Champion in 1893,\r\nand cup winner in 1894; Buscot Harold, in 1899, thus repeating his\r\ntwo-year-old performance; Halstead Royal Duke in 1909, the Royal\r\nChampion as a two-year-old.\r\n\r\nThe 1909 Show was remarkable for the successes of Lord Rothschild, who\r\nafter winning one of the championships for the previous six years, now\r\ntook both of the Challenge Cups, the reserve championship, and the Cup\r\nfor the best old stallion.\r\n\r\nThe next and last three-year-old to win was, or is, the renowned\r\nChampion’s Goalkeeper, who took the Challenge Cup in 1914 for the\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing the ages of the male and female champions of the London\r\nShow, it is seen that while the former often reach the pinnacle of\r\nfame in their youth, the latter rarely do till they have had time to\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHIGH PRICES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to give particulars of sums paid for many animals\r\nsold privately, as the amount is often kept secret, but a few may be\r\nmentioned. The first purchase to attract great attention was that of\r\nPrince William, by the late Lord Wantage from Mr. John Rowell in 1885\r\nfor £1500, or guineas, although Sir Walter Gilbey had before that given\r\na real good price to Mr. W. R. Rowland for the Bucks-bred Spark. The\r\nnext sensational private sale was that of Bury Victor Chief, the Royal\r\nChampion of 1891, to Mr. Joseph Wainwright, the seller again being\r\nMr. John Rowell and the price 2500 guineas. In that same year, 1891,\r\nChancellor, one of Premier’s noted sons, made 1100 guineas at Mr. A.\r\nC. Duncombe’s sale at Calwich, when eighteen of Premier’s sons and\r\ndaughters were paraded with their sire, and made an average, including\r\nfoals, of £273 each.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a record in letting was set up by the Welshpool Shire Horse\r\nSociety, who gave Lord Ellesmere £1000 for the use of Vulcan (the\r\nchampion of the 1891 London Show) to serve 100 mares. This society\r\nwas said to be composed of “shrewd tenant farmers who expected a good\r\nreturn for their money.” Since then a thousand pounds for a first-class\r\nsire has been paid many times, and it is in districts where they have\r\nbeen used that those in search of the best go for their foals. Two\r\nnotable instances can be mentioned, viz. Champion’s Goalkeeper and\r\nLorna Doone, the male and female champions of the London Show of 1914,\r\nwhich were both bred in the Welshpool district. Other high-priced\r\nstallions to be sold by auction in the nineties were Marmion to Mr.\r\nFred Crisp from Mr. Arkwright in 1892 for 1400 guineas, Waresley\r\nPremier Duke to Mr. Victor Cavendish (now the Duke of Devonshire) for\r\n1100 guineas at Mr. W. H. O. Duncombe’s sale in 1897, and a similar sum\r\nby the same buyer for Lord Llangattock’s Hendre Crown Prince in the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\nFor the next really high-priced stallion we must come to the dispersion\r\nof the late Lord Egerton’s stud in April, 1909, when Messrs. W. and H.\r\nWhitley purchased the five-year-old Tatton Dray King (London Champion\r\nin 1908) for 3700 guineas, to join their celebrated Devonshire stud.\r\nAt this sale Tatton Herald, a two-year-old colt, made 1200 guineas to\r\nMessrs. Ainscough, who won the championship with him at the Liverpool\r\nRoyal in 1910, but at the Royal Show of 1914 he figured, and won, as a\r\ngelding.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, however, these costly sires have proved well worth\r\ntheir money.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, the year 1913 will be remembered by the\r\nfact that 4100 guineas was given at Lord Rothschild’s sale for the\r\ntwo-year-old Shire colt Champion’s Goalkeeper, by Childwick Champion,\r\nwho, like Tatton Dray King and others, is likely to prove a good\r\ninvestment at his cost. Twice since then he has championed the London\r\nShow, and by the time these lines are read he may have accomplished\r\nthat great feat for the third time, his age being four years old in\r\n1915.\r\n\r\nOf mares, Starlight, previously mentioned, was the first to approach a\r\nthousand pounds in an auction sale.\r\n\r\nAt the Shire Horse Show of 1893 the late Mr. Philo Mills exhibited\r\nMoonlight, a mare which he had purchased privately for £1000, but she\r\nonly succeeded in getting a commended card, so good was the company in\r\nwhich she found herself. The first Shire mare to make over a thousand\r\nguineas at a stud sale was Dunsmore Gloaming, by Harold. This was at\r\nthe second Dunsmore Sale early in 1894, the price being 1010 guineas,\r\nand the purchaser Mr. W. J. Buckley, Penyfai, Carmarthen, from whom\r\nshe was repurchased by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz, and was again\r\nincluded in the Dunsmore catalogue of January 27, 1898, when she\r\nrealized 780 guineas, Sir J. Blundell Maple being the lucky purchaser,\r\nthe word being used because she won the challenge cup in London, both\r\nin 1899 and 1900. Foaled in 1890 at Sandringham, by Harold (London\r\nChampion), dam by Staunton Hero (London Champion), she was sold at\r\nKing Edward’s first sale in 1892 for 200 guineas. As a three- and\r\na four-year-old she was second in London, and she also won second\r\nprize as a seven-year-old for Sir P. A. Muntz, finally winning supreme\r\nhonours at nine and ten years of age, a very successful finish to a\r\ndistinguished career. On February 11th, 1898, another record was set by\r\nHis Majesty King Edward VII., whose three-year-old filly Sea Breeze, by\r\nthe same sire as Bearwardcote Blaze, made 1150 guineas, Sir J. Blundell\r\nMaple again being the buyer. The next mare to make four figures at a\r\nstud sale was Hendre Crown Princess at the Lockinge sale of February\r\n14, 1900, the successful bidder being Mr. H. H. Smith-Carington,\r\nAshby Folville, Melton Mowbray, who has bought and bred many good\r\nShires. The price was 1100 guineas. This date, February 14, seems to\r\nbe a particularly lucky one for Shire sales, for besides the one just\r\nmentioned Lord Rothschild has held at least two sales on February 14.\r\nIn 1908 the yearling colt King Cole VII. was bought by the late Lord\r\nWinterstoke for 900 guineas, the highest price realized by the stud\r\nsales of that year. Then there is the record sale at Tring Park on\r\nFebruary 14, 1913, when one stallion, Champions Goalkeeper, made 4100\r\nguineas, and another, Blacklands Kingmaker, 1750.\r\n\r\nThe honour for being the highest priced Shire mare sold at a stud sale\r\nbelongs to the great show mare, Pailton Sorais, for which Sir Arthur\r\nNicholson gave 1200 guineas at the dispersion sale of Mr. Max Michaelis\r\nat Tandridge, Surrey, on October 26, 1911. It will be remembered by\r\nShire breeders that she made a successful appearance in London each\r\nyear from one to eight years old, her list being: First, as a yearling;\r\nsixth, as a two-year-old; second, as a three-year-old; first and\r\nreserve champion at four years old, five and seven; first in her class\r\nat six. She was not to be denied the absolute championship, however,\r\nand it fell to her in 1911. No Shire in history has achieved greater\r\ndistinction than this, not even Honest Tom 1105, who won first prize\r\nat the Royal Show six years in succession, as the competition in those\r\nfar-off days was much less keen than that which Pailton Sorais had to\r\nface, and it should be mentioned that she was also a good breeder,\r\nthe foal by her side when she was sold made 310 guineas and another\r\ndaughter 400 guineas.\r\n\r\nSuch are the kind of Shire mares that farmers want. Those that will\r\nwork, win, and breed. As we have seen in this incomplete review, Aurea\r\nwon the championship of the London show, together with her son. Belle\r\nCole, the champion mare of 1908, bred a colt which realized 900 guineas\r\nas a yearling a few days before she herself gained her victory, a clear\r\nproof that showing and breeding are not incompatible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nA FEW RECORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe highest priced Shires sold by auction have already been given. So a\r\nfew of the most notable sales may be mentioned, together with the dates\r\nthey were held--\r\n\r\n                                                     £   _s._ _d._\r\n    Tring Park (draft), February 14, 1913:\r\n                               32 Shires averaged   454   0    0\r\n    Tatton Park (dispersion), April 23, 1909:\r\n                               21 Shires averaged   465   0    0\r\n    Tring Park (draft), February 14, 1905:\r\n                               35 Shires averaged   266  15    0\r\n    The Hendre, Monmouth (draft), October 18, 1900:\r\n                               42 Shires averaged   226   0    0\r\n    Sandringham (draft), February 11, 1898:\r\n                               52 Shires averaged   224   7    9\r\n    Tring Park (draft), January 15, 1902:\r\n                               40 Shires averaged   217  14    0\r\n    Tring Park (draft), January 12, 1898:\r\n                               35 Shires averaged   209  18    2\r\n    Dunsmore (dispersion), February 11, 1909:\r\n                               51 Shires averaged   200  12    0\r\n    Childwick (draft), February 13, 1901:\r\n                               46 Shires averaged   200   0    0\r\n    Tandridge (dispersion), October 28, 1911:\r\n                               84 Shires averaged   188  17    6\r\n\r\nThese ten are worthy of special mention, although there are several\r\nwhich come close up to the £200 average. That given first is the most\r\nnoteworthy for the reason that Lord Rothschild only sold a portion of\r\nhis stud, whereas the executors of the late Lord Egerton of Tatton\r\nsold their whole lot of twenty-one head, hence the higher average.\r\nTwo clear records were, however, set up at the historical Tring Park\r\nsale in 1913, viz. the highest individual price for a stallion and the\r\nhighest average price for animals by one sire, seven sons and daughters\r\nof Childwick Champion, making no less than £927 each, including two\r\nyearling colts.\r\n\r\nThe best average of the nineteenth century was that made at its close\r\nby the late Lord Llangattock, who had given a very high price privately\r\nfor Prince Harold, by Harold, which, like his sire, was a very\r\nsuccessful stock horse, his progeny making a splendid average at this\r\ncelebrated sale. A spirited bidder at all of the important sales and a\r\nvery successful exhibitor, Lord Llangattock did not succeed in winning\r\neither of the London Championships.\r\n\r\nOne private sale during 1900 is worth mentioning, which was that of Mr.\r\nJames Eadie’s two cup-winning geldings, Bardon Extraordinary and Barrow\r\nFarmer for 225 guineas each, a price which has only been equalled once\r\nto the writer’s knowledge. This was in the autumn of 1910, when Messrs.\r\nTruman gave 225 guineas for a gelding, at Messrs. Manley’s Repository,\r\nCrewe, this specimen of the English lorry horse being bought for export\r\nto the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the late Lord Wantage held a sale which possessed unique\r\nfeatures in that fifty animals catalogued were all sired by the dual\r\nLondon Champion and Windsor Royal (Jubilee Show) Gold Medal Winner,\r\nPrince William, to whom reference has already been made. The average\r\nwas just over £116. As a great supporter of the old English breed, Lord\r\nWantage, K.C.B., a Crimean veteran, deserves to be bracketed with the\r\nrecently deceased Sir Walter Gilbey, inasmuch as that in 1890 he gave\r\nthe Lockinge Cup for the best Shire mare exhibited at the London show,\r\nwhich Starlight succeeded in winning outright for Mr. Fred Crisp in\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Gilbey gave the Elsenham Cup for the best stallion, value\r\n100 guineas, in 1884, which, however, was not won permanently till the\r\nlate Earl of Ellesmere gained his second championship with Vulcan in\r\n1891. Since these dates the Shire Horse Society has continued to give\r\nthe Challenge Cups both for the best stallion and mare.\r\n\r\nThe sales hitherto mentioned have been those of landowners, but it must\r\nnot be supposed that tenant farmers have been unable to get Shires\r\nenough to call a home sale. On February 5, 1890, Mr. A. H. Clark sold\r\nfifty-one Shires at Moulton Eaugate, the average being £127 5_s._, the\r\nstriking feature of this sale being the number of grey (Thumper) mares.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1901, Mr. Clark and Mr. F. W. Griffin, another very\r\nsuccessful farmer breeder in the Fens, held a joint sale at Postland,\r\nthe former’s average being £100 6_s._ 9_d._, and the latter’s £123\r\n9_s._ 8_d._, each selling twenty-five animals.\r\n\r\nThe last home sale held by a farmer was that of Mr. Matthew Hubbard\r\nat Eaton, Grantham, on November 1, 1912, when an average of £73 was\r\nobtained for fifty-seven lots.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to Harold, Premier, and Prince William,\r\nas sires, but there have been others equally famous since the Shire\r\nHorse Society has been in existence. Among them may be mentioned Bar\r\nNone, who won at the 1882 London Show for the late Mr. James Forshaw,\r\nstood for service at his celebrated Carlton Stud Farm for a dozen\r\nseasons, and is credited with having sired over a thousand foals. They\r\nwere conspicuous for flat bone and silky feather, when round cannon\r\nbones and curly hair were much more common than they are to-day,\r\ntherefore both males and females by Bar None were highly prized; £2000\r\nwas refused for at least one of his sons, while a two-year-old daughter\r\nmade 800 guineas in 1891. For several years the two sires of Mr. A. C.\r\nDuncombe, at Calwich, Harold and Premier, sired many winners, and in\r\nthose days the Ashbourne Foal Show was worth a journey to see.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Sir P. Albert Muntz took first prize in London with a\r\nbig-limbed yearling, Dunsmore Jameson, who turned out to be the sire\r\nof strapping yearlings, two- and three-year-olds, which carried all\r\nbefore them in the show ring for several years, and a three-year-old\r\nson made the highest price ever realized at any of the Dunsmore Sales,\r\nwhen the stud was dispersed in 1909. This was 1025 guineas given by\r\nLord Middleton for Dunsmore Jameson II. For four years in succession,\r\n1903 to 1906, Dunsmore Jameson sired the highest number of winners, not\r\nonly in London, but at all the principal shows. His service fee was\r\nfifteen guineas to “approved mares only,” a high figure for a horse\r\nwhich had only won at the Shire Horse Show as a yearling. Among others\r\nhe sired Dunsmore Raider, who in turn begot Dunsmore Chessie, Champion\r\nmare at the London Shows of 1912 and 1913. Jameson contained the blood\r\nof Lincolnshire Lad on both sides of his pedigree. By the 1907 show\r\nanother sire had come to the front, and his success was phenomenal;\r\nthis was Lockinge Forest King, bred by the late Lord Wantage in 1889,\r\npurchased by the late Mr. J. P. Cross, of Catthorpe Towers, Rugby, who\r\nwon first prize, and reserve for the junior cup with him in London as\r\na three-year-old, also first and champion at the (Carlisle) Royal\r\nShow the same year, 1902. It is worth while to study the breeding of\r\nLockinge Forest King.\r\n\r\n_Sire_--Lockinge Manners.\r\n\r\n_Grand sire_--Prince Harold.\r\n\r\n_Great grand sire_--Harold.\r\n\r\n_Great great grand sire_--Lincolnshire Lad II. 1365.\r\n\r\n_Great great great grand sire_--Lincolnshire Lad 1196 (Drew’s).\r\n\r\nThe dam of Lockinge Forest King was The Forest Queen (by Royal Albert,\r\n1885, a great sire in his day); she was first prize winner at the Royal\r\nShow, Nottingham, 1888, first and champion, Peterborough, 1888, first\r\nBath and West, 1887 and 1888, and numerous other prizes. Her dam traced\r\nback to (Dack’s) Matchless (1509), a horse which no less an authority\r\nthan the late Mr. James Forshaw described as “the sire of all time.”\r\n\r\nThis accounts for the marvellous success of Lockinge Forest King as a\r\nstud horse, although his success, unlike Jameson’s, came rather late in\r\nhis life of ten years. He died in 1909. We have already seen that he\r\nhas sired the highest priced Shire mare publicly sold. At the Newcastle\r\nRoyal of 1908, both of the gold medal winners were by him, so were\r\nthe two champions at the 1909 Shire Horse Show. His most illustrious\r\nfamily was bred by a tenant farmer, Mr. John Bradley, Halstead, Tilton,\r\nLeicester. The eldest member is Halstead Royal Duke, the London\r\nChampion of 1909, Halstead Blue Blood, 3rd in London, 1910, both owned\r\nby Lord Rothschild, and Halstead Royal Duchess, who won the junior cup\r\nin London for her breeder in 1912. The dam of the trio is Halstead\r\nDuchess III by Menestrel, by Hitchin Conqueror (London Champion, 1890).\r\n\r\nTwo other matrons deserve to be mentioned, as they will always shine in\r\nthe history of the Shire breed. One is Lockington Beauty by Champion\r\n457, who died at a good old age at Batsford Park, having produced\r\nPrince William, the champion referred to more than once in these pages,\r\nhis sire being William the Conqueror. Then Marmion II (by Harold),\r\nwho was first in London in 1891, and realized 1400 guineas at Mr.\r\nArkwright’s sale. Also a daughter, Blue Ruin, which won at London Show\r\nof 1889 for Mr. R. N. Sutton-Nelthorpe, but, unfortunately, died from\r\nfoaling in that year. Another famous son was Mars Victor, a horse of\r\ngreat size, and also a London winner, on more than one occasion. He was\r\npurchased by Mr. (Sir) Walter Gilbey from Mr. Freeman-Mitford (Lord\r\nRedesdale) in the year of his sire’s--Hitchin Conqueror’s--championship\r\nin 1890, for the sum of £1500. Another was Momus by Laughing Stock.\r\nBlue Ruin was own sister to Prince William, but the other three were by\r\ndifferent sires.\r\n\r\nTo look at--I saw her in 1890--Lockington Beauty was quite a common\r\nmare with obviously small knees, and none too much weight and width,\r\nher distinguishing feature being a mane of extraordinary length.\r\n\r\nThe remaining dam to be mentioned as a great breeder is Nellie\r\nBlacklegs by Bestwick’s Prince, famous for having bred five sons--which\r\nwere all serving mares in the year 1891--and a daughter, all by\r\nPremier. The first was Northwood, a horse used long and successfully by\r\nLord Middleton and the sire of Birdsall Darling, the dam of Birdsall\r\nMenestrel, London champion of 1904. The second, Hydrometer, first\r\nin London in 1889, then sold to the late Duke of Marlborough, and\r\npurchased when his stud was dispersed in 1893 by the Warwick Shire\r\nHorse Society for 600 guineas. Then came Chancellor, sold at Mr. A.\r\nC. Duncombe’s sale in 1891 for 1100 guineas, a record in those days,\r\nto Mr. F. Crisp, who let him to the Peterborough Society in 1892 for\r\n£500. Calwich Topsman, another son, realized 500 guineas when sold, and\r\nSenator made 350. The daughter, rightly named “Sensible,” bred Mr. John\r\nSmith of Ellastone, Ashbourne, a colt foal by Harold in 1893, which\r\nturned out to be Markeaton Royal Harold, the champion stallion of 1897.\r\nThis chapter was headed “A few records,” and surely this set up by\r\nPremier and Nellie Blacklegs is one.\r\n\r\nThe record show of the Shire Horse Society, as regards the number of\r\nentries, was that of 1904, with a total of 862; the next for size was\r\nthe 1902 meeting when 860 were catalogued. Of course the smallest\r\nshow was the initial one of 1880, when 76 stallions and 34 mares made\r\na total of 110 entries. The highest figure yet made in the public\r\nauction sales held at the London Show is 1175 guineas given by Mr.\r\nR. Heath, Biddulph Grange, Staffs., in 1911 for Rickford Coming\r\nKing, a three-year-old bred by the late Lord Winterstoke, and sold by\r\nhis executors, after having won fourth in his class, although first\r\nand reserve for the junior cup as a two-year-old. He was sired by\r\nRavenspur, with which King Edward won first prize in London, 1906,\r\nhis price of 825 guineas to Lord Winterstoke at the Wolferton Sale\r\nof February 8, 1907, being the highest at any sale of that year. The\r\nlesson to be learned is that if you want to create a record with Shires\r\nyou must begin and continue with well-bred ones, or you will never\r\nreach the desired end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nJUDGES AT THE LONDON SHOWS, 1890-1915\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are the Judges of a quarter of a century’s Shires in\r\nLondon:--\r\n\r\n    1890.

Very often the same\r\njudges have officiated at several important exhibitions during the\r\nsame season, which has tended towards uniformity in prize-winning\r\nShires. On looking down the list, it will be seen that four judges\r\nwere appointed till 1895, while the custom of the Society to get its\r\nCouncil from as many counties as possible has not been followed in\r\nthe matter of judges’ selection. For instance, Warwickshire--a great\r\ncounty for Shire breeding--has only provided two judges in twenty-six\r\nyears, and one of them--Mr. Potter--had recently come from Lockington\r\nGrounds, Derby, where he bred the renowned Prince William. For many\r\nyears Hertfordshire has provided a string of winners, yet no judge has\r\nhailed from that county, or from Surrey, which contains quite a number\r\nof breeders of Shire horses. No fault whatever is being found with the\r\nway the judging has been carried out. It is no light task, and nobody\r\nbut an expert could, or should, undertake it; but it is only fair to\r\npoint out that high-class Shires are, and have been, bred in Cornwall,\r\nand Devonshire, Kent, and every other county, while the entries at the\r\nshow of 1914 included a stallion bred in the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, as elsewhere stated, the membership of the Society was 1615,\r\nwhereas the number of members given in the 1914 volume of the Stud Book\r\nis 4200. The aim of each and all is “to improve the Old English breed\r\nof Cart Horses,” many of which may now be truthfully described by their\r\nold title of “War Horses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE EXPORT TRADE\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the first to recognize the enormous power and possibilities of\r\nthe Shire were the Americans. Very few London shows had been held\r\nbefore they were looking out for fully-registered specimens to take\r\nacross the Atlantic. Towards the close of the ’eighties a great export\r\ntrade was done, the climax being reached in 1889, when the Shire Horse\r\nSociety granted 1264 export certificates. A society to safeguard the\r\ninterests of the breed was formed in America, these being the remarks\r\nof Mr. A. Galbraith (President of the American Shire Horse Society) in\r\nhis introductory essay: “At no time in the history of the breed have\r\nfirst-class animals been so valuable as now, the praiseworthy endeavour\r\nto secure the best specimens of the breed having the natural effect of\r\nenhancing prices all round. Breeders of Shire horses both in England\r\nand America have a hopeful and brilliant future before them, and by\r\nexercising good judgment in their selections, and giving due regard to\r\npedigree and soundness, as well as individual merit, they will not only\r\nreap a rich pecuniary reward, but prove a blessing and a benefit to\r\nthis country.”\r\n\r\nFrom the day that the Shire Horse Society was incorporated, on June\r\n3, 1878, until now, America has been Britain’s best overseas customer\r\nfor Shire horses, a good second being our own colony, the Dominion of\r\nCanada. Another stockbreeding country to make an early discovery of the\r\nmerits of “The Great Horse” was Argentina, to which destination many\r\ngood Shires have gone. In 1906 the number given in the Stud Book was\r\n118. So much importance is attached to the breed both in the United\r\nStates and in the Argentine Republic that English judges have travelled\r\nto each of those country’s shows to award the prizes in the Shire\r\nClasses.\r\n\r\nAnother great country with which a good and growing trade has been done\r\nis Russia. In 1904 the number was eleven, in 1913 it had increased to\r\nfifty-two, so there is evidently a market there which is certain to be\r\nextended when peace has been restored and our powerful ally sets about\r\nthe stupendous, if peaceful, task of replenishing her horse stock.\r\n\r\nOur other allies have their own breeds of draught horses, therefore\r\nthey have not been customers for Shires, but with war raging in their\r\nbreeding grounds, the numbers must necessarily be reduced almost to\r\nextinction, consequently the help of the Shire may be sought for\r\nbuilding up their breeds in days to come.\r\n\r\nGerman buyers have not fancied Shire horses to any extent--British-bred\r\nre-mounts have been more in their line.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, however, Germany was the destination of thirty-one. By 1910\r\nthe number had declined to eleven, and in 1913 to three, therefore, if\r\nthe export of trade in Shires to “The Fatherland” is altogether lost,\r\nEnglish breeders will scarcely feel it.\r\n\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, and South Africa are parts of the British\r\nEmpire to which Shires have been shipped for several years. Substantial\r\nprizes in the shape of Cups and Medals are now given by the Shire\r\nHorse Society to the best specimens of the breed exhibited at Foreign\r\nand Colonial Shows.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCOURAGING THE EXPORT OF SHIRES\r\n\r\nThe following is reprinted from the “Farmer and Stockbreeder Year Book”\r\nfor 1906, and was written by S. H. L. (J. A. Frost):--\r\n\r\n    “The Old English breed of cart horse, or ‘Shire,’ is\r\n    universally admitted to be the best and most valuable animal\r\n    for draught purposes in the world, and a visitor from America,\r\n    Mr. Morrow, of the United States Department of Agriculture,\r\n    speaking at Mr. John Rowell’s sale of Shires in 1889, said,\r\n    ‘Great as had been the business done in Shire horses in\r\n    America, the trade is but in its infancy, for the more Shire\r\n    horses became known, and the more they came into competition\r\n    with other breeds, the more their merits for all heavy draught\r\n    purposes were appreciated.’\r\n\r\n    “These remarks are true to-day, for although sixteen years have\r\n    elapsed since they were made (1906), the massive Shire has more\r\n    than held his own, but in the interests of the breed, and of\r\n    the nearly four thousand members of the Shire Horse Society,\r\n    it is still doubtful whether the true worth of the Shire\r\n    horse is properly known and appreciated in foreign countries\r\n    and towns needing heavy horses, and whether the export trade\r\n    in this essentially British breed is not capable of further\r\n    development. The number of export certificates granted by the\r\n    Shire Horse Society in 1889 was 1264, which takes a good deal\r\n    of beating, but it must be remembered that since then Shire\r\n    horse breeding at home has progressed by leaps and bounds,\r\n    and tenant farmers, who could only look on in those days,\r\n    are now members of the flourishing Shire Horse Society and\r\n    owners of breeding studs, and such prices as 800 guineas for a\r\n    two-year-old filly and 230 guineas for a nine-months-old colt,\r\n    are less frequently obtainable than they were then; therefore,\r\n    an increase in the demand from other countries would find more\r\n    Shire breeders ready to supply it, although up to the present\r\n    the home demand has been and is very good, and weighty geldings\r\n    continue to be scarce and dear.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NUMBER EXPORTED\r\n\r\n“It may be true that the number of horses exported during the last year\r\nor two has been higher than ever, but when the average value of those\r\nthat go to ‘other countries’ than Holland, Belgium, and France, is\r\nworked out, it does not allow of such specimens as would excite the\r\nadmiration of a foreign merchant or Colonial farmer being exported,\r\nexcept in very isolated instances; then the tendency of American buyers\r\nis to give preference to stallions which are on the quality rather than\r\non the weighty side, and as the mares to which they are eventually put\r\nare also light boned, the typical English dray horse is not produced.\r\n\r\n“During the past year (1905) foreign buyers have been giving very\r\nhigh prices for Shorthorn cattle, and if they would buy in the same\r\nspirited manner at the Shire sales, a much more creditable animal\r\ncould be obtained for shipment. As an advertisement for the Shire\r\nit is obviously beneficial that the Shire Horse Society--which is\r\nunquestionably the most successful breed society in existence--gives\r\nprizes for breeding stock and also geldings at a few of the most\r\nimportant horse shows in the United States. This tends to bring the\r\nbreed into prominence abroad, and it is certain that many Colonial\r\nfarmers would rejoice at being able to breed working geldings of a\r\nsimilar type to those which may be seen shunting trucks on any large\r\nrailway station in England, or walking smartly along in front of a\r\nbinder in harvest. The writer has a relative farming in the North-West\r\nTerritory of Canada, and his last letter says, ‘The only thing in\r\nthe stock line that there is much money in now is horses; they are\r\nkeeping high, and seem likely to for years, as so many new settlers are\r\ncoming in all the time, and others do not seem able to raise enough\r\nfor their own needs’; and it may be mentioned that almost the only\r\nkind of stallions available there are of the Percheron breed, which\r\nis certainly not calculated to improve the size, or substance, of the\r\nnative draught horse stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COST OF SHIPPING\r\n\r\n“The cost of shipping a horse from Liverpool to New York is about £11,\r\nwhich is not prohibitive for such an indispensable animal as the Shire\r\nhorse, and if such specimens of the breed as the medal winners at shows\r\nlike Peterborough could be exhibited in the draught horse classes at\r\nthe best horse shows of America, it is more than probable that at least\r\nsome of the visitors would be impressed with their appearance, and an\r\nincrease in the export trade in Shires might thereby be brought about.\r\n\r\n“A few years ago the price of high-class Shire stallions ran upwards of\r\na thousand pounds, which placed them beyond the reach of exporters;\r\nbut the reign of what may be called ‘fancy’ prices appears to be\r\nover, at least for a time, seeing that the general sale averages have\r\ndeclined since that of Lord Llangattock in October, 1900, when the\r\nrecord average of £226 1_s._ 8_d._ was made, although the best general\r\naverage for the sales of any single year was obtained in 1901, viz.\r\n£112 5_s._ 10_d._ for 633 animals, and it was during that year that the\r\nhighest price for Shires was obtained at an auction sale, the sum being\r\n1550 guineas, given by Mr. Leopold Salomons, for the stallion Hendre\r\nChampion, at the late Mr. Crisp’s sale at Girton. Other high-priced\r\nstallions purchased by auction include Marmion II., 1400 guineas, and\r\nChancellor, 1100 guineas, both by Mr. Crisp. Waresley Premier Duke,\r\n1100 guineas, and Hendre Crown Prince, 1100 guineas, were two purchases\r\nof Mr. Victor Cavendish in the year 1897. These figures show that the\r\nworth of a really good Shire stallion can hardly be estimated, and\r\nit is certain that the market for this particular class of animal is\r\nby no means glutted, but rather the reverse, as the number of males\r\noffered at the stud sales is always limited, which proves that there\r\nis ‘room on the top’ for the stallion breeder, and with this fact in\r\nview and the possible chance of an increased foreign trade in stallions\r\nit behoves British breeders of Shires to see to it that there is no\r\nfalling off in the standard of the horses ‘raised,’ to use the American\r\nword, but rather that a continual improvement is aimed at, so that\r\nvisitors from horse-breeding countries may find what they want if they\r\ncome to ‘the stud farm of the world.’\r\n\r\n“The need to keep to the right lines and breed from good old stock\r\nwhich has produced real stock-getting stallions cannot be too strongly\r\nemphasised, for the reason that there is a possibility of the British\r\nmarket being overstocked with females, with a corresponding dearth of\r\nmales, both stallions and geldings, and although this is a matter which\r\nbreeders cannot control they can at least patronise a strain of blood\r\nfamous for its males. The group of Premier--Nellie Blacklegs’ brothers,\r\nNorthwood, Hydrometer, Senator, and Calwich Topsman--may be quoted as\r\nshowing the advisability of continuing to use the same horse year after\r\nyear if colt foals are bred, and wanted, and the sire is a horse of\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\n“With the number of breeders of Shire horses and the plentiful supply\r\nof mares, together with the facilities offered by local stallion-hiring\r\nsocieties, it ought not to be impossible to breed enough high-grade\r\nsires to meet the home demand and leave a surplus for export as well,\r\nand the latter of the class that will speak for themselves in other\r\ncountries, and lead to enquiries for more of the same sort.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW HIGH PRICES FROM EXPORTERS\r\n\r\n“It is noteworthy that few, if any, of the high prices obtained for\r\nShires at public sales have come from exporters or buyers from abroad,\r\nbut from lovers of the heavy breed in England, who have been either\r\nforming or replenishing studs, therefore, ‘the almighty dollar’ has not\r\nbeen responsible for the figures above quoted. Still it is probable\r\nthat with the opening up of the agricultural industry in Western\r\nCanada, South Africa, and elsewhere, Shire stallions will be needed to\r\nhelp the Colonial settlers to build up a breed of horses which will be\r\nuseful for both tillage and haulage purposes.\r\n\r\n“The adaptability of the Shire horse to climate and country is well\r\nknown, and it is satisfactory for home breeders to hear that Mr.\r\nMartinez de Hoz has recently sold ten Shires, bred in Argentina, at an\r\naverage of £223 2_s._ 6_d._, one, a three-year-old, making £525.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile it might be a good investment if a syndicate of British\r\nbreeders placed a group of typical Shire horses in a few of the biggest\r\nfairs or shows in countries where weighty horses are wanted, and thus\r\nfurther the interests of the Shire abroad, and assist in developing the\r\nexport trade.”\r\n\r\nIt may be added that during the summer of 1906, H.M. King Edward and\r\nLord Rothschild sent a consignment of Shires to the United States of\r\nAmerica for exhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPROMINENT PRESENT-DAY STUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing that Lord Rothschild has won the greatest number of challenge\r\ncups and holds the record for having made the highest price, his name\r\nis mentioned first among owners of famous studs.\r\n\r\nHe joined the Shire Horse Society in February, 1891, and at the show\r\nof 1892 made five entries for the London Show at which he purchased\r\nthe second prize three-year-old stallion Carbonite (by Carbon by\r\nLincolnshire Lad II.) from Mr. Edward Green for 1100 guineas. He is\r\nremembered by the writer as being a wide and weighty horse on short\r\nlegs which carried long hair in attendance, and this type has been\r\nfound at Tring Park ever since. In 1895 his lordship won first and\r\nthird with two chestnut fillies--Vulcan’s Flower by the Champion Vulcan\r\nand Walkern Primrose by Hitchin Duke (by Bar None). The former won the\r\nFilly Cup and was subsequently sold to help to found the famous stud\r\nof Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park, Surrey, the sum given being a\r\nvery high one for those days.\r\n\r\nThe first championship was obtained with the mare Alston Rose in 1901,\r\nwhich won like honours for Mr. R. W. Hudson in 1902, after costing him\r\n750 guineas at the second sale at Tring Park, January 15, 1902.\r\n\r\nSolace, bred by King Edward, was the next champion mare from Lord\r\nRothschild’s stud. Girton Charmer, winner of the Challenge Cup in\r\n1905, was included in a select shipment of Shires sent to America (as\r\nmodels of the breed) by our late lamented King and Lord Rothschild in\r\n1906. Princess Beryl, Belle Cole, Chiltern Maid, were mares to win\r\nhighest honours for the stud, while a young mare which passed through\r\nLord Rothschild’s hands, and realized a four-figure sum for him as\r\na two-year-old from the Devonshire enthusiasts, Messrs. W. and H.\r\nWhitley, is Lorna Doone, the Champion mare of 1914.\r\n\r\nChampion’s Goalkeeper, the Tring record-breaker, has been mentioned,\r\nso we can now refer to the successful stud of which he is the central\r\nfigure, viz. that owned by Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park,\r\nWoldingham, Surrey, who, as we have seen, bought a good filly from the\r\nTring Stud in 1895, the year in which he became a member of the Shire\r\nHorse Society. At Lord Rothschild’s first sale in 1898, he purchased\r\nWindley Lily for 430 guineas, and Moorish Maiden, a three-year-old\r\nfilly, for 350, since when he has bid only for the best. At the\r\nTandridge dispersion sale he gave over a thousand pounds for the\r\nLockinge Forest King mare, Fuchsia of Tandridge, and her foal. Sir\r\nWalpole was one of the first to profit by the Lockinge Forest King\r\nblood, his filly, Marden Peach, by that sire having been a winner at\r\nthe Royal of 1908, while her daughter, Marden Constance, has had a\r\nbrilliant show career, so has Dunsmore Chessie, purchased from Mr. T.\r\nEwart as a yearling, twice London Champion mare.\r\n\r\nNo sale has been held at Marden, but consignments have been sold at\r\nPeterborough, so that the prefix is frequently met with.\r\n\r\nThe stud owner who is willing to give £4305 for a two-year-old colt\r\ndeserves success.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMLEY STUD\r\n\r\nAt the Dunsmore Sale on February 14, 1907, Mr. W. Whitley purchased\r\nDunsmore Fuchsia (by Jameson), the London Cup winner of 1905 and 1906,\r\nfor 520 guineas, also Quality by the same sire, and these two won\r\nsecond and third for him in London the same month, this being the first\r\nshow at which the Primley shires took honours.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of Tatton Dray King, the Champion stallion of 1908, by\r\nMessrs. W. and H. Whitley in the spring of 1909 for 3700 guineas\r\ncreated quite a sensation, as it was an outstanding record, it stood so\r\nfor nearly four years.\r\n\r\nOne of the most successful show mares in this--or any--stud is\r\nMollington Movement by Lockinge Forest King, but the reigning queen is\r\nLorna Doone, the London and Peterborough Champion of 1914, purchased\r\nprivately from the Tring Park Stud. Another built on the same lines\r\nis Sussex Pride with which a Bucks tenant farmer, Mr. R. H. Keene,\r\nwon first and reserve champion at the London Show of 1913, afterwards\r\nselling her to Messrs. Whitley, who again won with her in 1914. With\r\nsuch animals as these Devonshire is likely to hold its own with Shires,\r\nalthough they do not come from the district known to the law makers of\r\nold as the breeding ground of “the Great Horse.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PENDLEY FEMALES\r\n\r\nOne of the most successful exhibitors of mares, fillies, and foals, at\r\nthe shows of the past few seasons has been Mr. J. G. Williams, Pendley\r\nManor, Tring. Like other exhibitors already mentioned, the one under\r\nnotice owes much of his success to Lockinge Forest King. In 1908 Lord\r\nEgerton’s Tatton May Queen was purchased for 420 guineas, she having\r\nbeen first in London as a yearling and two-year-old; Bardon Forest\r\nPrincess, a reserve London Champion, and Barnfields Forest Queen, Cup\r\nwinner there, made a splendid team of winners by the sire named. At the\r\nTring Park sale of 1913 Mr. Williams gave the highest price made by\r\na female, 825 guineas, for Halstead Duchess VII., by Redlynch Forest\r\nKing. She won the Royal Championship at Bristol for him. One of the\r\nlater acquisitions is Snelston Lady, by Slipton King, Cup winner and\r\nreserve Champion in London, 1914, as a three-year-old, first at the\r\nRoyal, and reserve Champion at Peterborough. Mr. Williams joined the\r\nShire Horse Society in 1906, since when he has won all but the London\r\nChampionship with his mares and fillies.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW STUD\r\n\r\nAfter Champion’s Goalkeeper was knocked down Mr. Beck announced that\r\nthe disappointed bidder was Mr. C. R. H. Gresson, acting for the\r\nEdgcote Shorthorn Company, Wardington, Banbury, his date of admission\r\nto the Shire Horse Society being during that same month, February,\r\n1913. Having failed to get the popular colt, his stable companion and\r\nhalf brother, Stockman III., was purchased for 540 guineas, and shown\r\nin London just after, where he won fourth prize. From this single entry\r\nin 1913 the foundation of the stud was so rapid that seven entries\r\nwere made at the 1914 London Show. Fine Feathers was the first prize\r\nyearling filly, Blackthorn Betty the second prize two-year-old filly,\r\nthe own bred Edgcote Monarch being the second prize yearling colt.\r\nAfter the show Lord Rothschild’s first prize two-year colt, Orfold\r\nBlue Blood, was bought, together with Normandy Jessie, the third prize\r\nyearling colt; so with these two, Fine Feathers, Betty, Chirkenhill\r\nForest Queen, and Writtle Coming Queen, the Edgcote Shorthorn Co.,\r\nLtd., took a leading place at the shows of 1914. In future Edgcote\r\npromises to be as famous for its Shires as it has hitherto been for its\r\nShorthorns.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUCAL STUDS\r\n\r\nA very successful exhibitor of the past season has been his Grace\r\nthe Duke of Westminster, who owns a very good young sire in Eaton\r\nNunsuch--so good that he has been hired by the Peterborough Society.\r\nShires have been bred on the Eaton Hall estate for many years, and the\r\nstud contains many promising animals now.\r\n\r\nMention must be made of the great interest taken in Shires by the Duke\r\nof Devonshire who, as the Hon. Victor Cavendish, kept a first-class\r\nstud at Holker, Lancs. At the Royal Show of 1909 (Gloucester) Holker\r\nMars was the Champion Shire stallion, Warton Draughtsman winning the\r\nNorwich Royal Championship, and also that of the London Show of 1912\r\nfor his popular owner.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER STUDS\r\n\r\nAmong those who have done much to promote the breeding of the Old\r\nEnglish type of cart-horse, the name of Mr. Clement Keevil deserves\r\na foremost place. At Blagdon, Malden, Surrey, he held a number of\r\nstud sales in the eighties and nineties, to which buyers went for\r\nmassive-limbed Shires of the good old strains; those with a pedigree\r\nwhich traced back to Honest Tom (_alias_ Little David), foaled in the\r\nyear 1769, to Wiseman’s Honest Tom, foaled in 1800, or to Samson a sire\r\nweighing 1 ton 8 cwt. Later he had a stud at Billington, Beds, where\r\nseveral sales were held, the last being in 1908, when Mr. Everard gave\r\n860 guineas for the stallion, Lockinge Blagdon. Shortly before that he\r\nsold Blagdon Benefactor for 1000 guineas.\r\n\r\nThe prefix “Birdsall” has been seen in show catalogues for a number of\r\nyears, which mean that the animals holding it were bred, or owned, by\r\nLord Middleton, at Birdsall, York, he being one of the first noblemen\r\nto found a stud, and he has ably filled the Presidential Chair of the\r\nShire Horse Society. As long ago as the 1892 London Show there were two\r\nentries from Birdsall by Lord Middleton’s own sire, Northwood, to which\r\nreference is made elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnother notable sire purchased by his lordship was Menestrel, first in\r\nLondon, 1900 (by Hitchin Conqueror), his most famous son being Birdsall\r\nMenestrel, dam Birdsall Darling by Northwood, sold to Lord Rothschild\r\nas a yearling. As a two-year-old this colt was Cup winner and reserve\r\nChampion, and at four he was Challenge Cup winner. A good bidder at\r\nShire sales, the breeder of a champion, and a consistent supporter of\r\nthe Shire breeding industry since 1883, it is regrettable that champion\r\nhonours have not fallen to Lord Middleton himself.\r\n\r\nAnother stud, which was founded near Leeds, by Mr. A. Grandage, has\r\nnow been removed to Cheshire. Joining the Shire Horse Society in 1892,\r\nhis first entry in London was made in 1893, and four years later, in\r\n1897, Queen of the Shires (by Harold) won the mare Championship for Mr.\r\nGrandage.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 the winning four-year-old stallion, Gaer Conqueror, of\r\nLincolnshire Lad descent, was bought from Mr. Edward Green for 825\r\nguineas, which proved to be a real good investment for Mr. Grandage,\r\nseeing that he won the championship of the Shire Horse Show for the two\r\nfollowing years, 1910 and 1911.\r\n\r\nCandidates from the Bramhope Stud, Monks Heath, Chelford, Cheshire, are\r\nlikely to give a very good account of themselves in the days to come.\r\n\r\nAmong those who will have the best Shires is Sir Arthur Nicholson,\r\nHighfield, Leek, Staffs. His first London success was third prize with\r\nRokeby Friar (by Harold) as a two-year-old in 1893, since which date he\r\nhas taken a keen personal interest in the breeding of Shire horses, and\r\nhas the honour of having purchased Pailton Sorais, the highest-priced\r\nmare yet sold by auction. At the Tring sale of 1913 he gave the second\r\nhighest price of that day, viz., 1750 guineas for the three-year-old\r\nstallion, Blacklands Kingmaker, who won first prize for him in London\r\nten days after, but, alas, was taken ill during his season, for the\r\nWinslow Shire Horse Society, and died. Another bad loss to Sir Arthur\r\nand to Shire breeders generally was the death of Redlynch Forest King,\r\nseeing that he promised to rival his renowned sire, Lockinge Forest\r\nKing, for begetting show animals.\r\n\r\nAmong the many good ones recently exhibited from the stud may be\r\nmentioned Leek Dorothy, twice first in London, and Leek Challenger,\r\nfirst as a yearling, second as a two-year-old, both of these being by\r\nRedlynch Forest King. With such as these coming on there is a future\r\nbefore the Shires of Sir Arthur Nicholson.\r\n\r\nThe name of Muntz is familiar to all Shire breeders owing to the fame\r\nachieved by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz. In 1899 Mr. F. E. Muntz,\r\nof Umberslade, Hockley Heath, Warwickshire, a nephew of the Dunsmore\r\nBaronet, joined the Shire Horse Society, and has since been President.\r\nQuite a good share of prizes have fallen to him, including the Cup for\r\nthe best old stallion in London both in 1913 and 1914. The winner,\r\nDanesfield Stonewall, was reserved for the absolute championship on\r\nboth occasions, and this typical “Old English Black” had a host of\r\nadmirers, while Jones--the Umberslade stud groom--will never forget his\r\nparade before His Majesty King George at the 1913 show.\r\n\r\nIt used to be said that Shires did not flourish south of London, but\r\nMr. Leopold Salomons, Norbury Park, Dorking, has helped to prove\r\notherwise. Beginning with one entry at the 1899 Show, he has entered\r\nquite a string for several years, and the stud contains a number of\r\nhigh-class stallions, notably Norbury Menestrel, winner of many prizes,\r\nand a particularly well-bred and promising sire, and King of Tandridge\r\n(by Lockinge Forest King), purchased by Mr. Salomons at the Tandridge\r\ndispersion sale for 1600 guineas. At the sale during the London Show of\r\n1914 Mr. Salomons realized the highest price with his own bred Norbury\r\nCoronation, by Norbury Menestrel, who, after winning third prize in his\r\nclass, cost the Leigh Shire Horse Society 850 guineas, Norbury George,\r\nby the same sire, winning fifth prize, and making 600 guineas, both\r\nbeing three years old. This is the kind of advertisement for a stud,\r\nno matter where its situation.\r\n\r\nAnother Surrey enthusiast is Sir Edward Stern, Fan Court, Chertsey, who\r\nhas been a member of the Shire Horse Society since 1903. He purchased\r\nDanesfield Stonewall from Mr. R. W. Hudson, and won several prizes\r\nbefore re-selling him to Mr. F. E. Muntz. His stud horses now includes\r\nMarathon II., champion at the Oxford County Show of 1910. Mares and\r\nfillies have also been successfully shown at the Royal Counties, and\r\nother meetings in the south of England from the Fan Court establishment.\r\n\r\nA fine lot of Shires have been got together, at Tarnacre House,\r\nGarstang, and the first prize yearling at the London Show of 1914,\r\nKing’s Choice, was bred by Messrs. J. E. and A. W. Potter, who also won\r\nfirst with Monnow Drayman, the colt with which Mr. John Ferneyhough\r\ntook first prize as a three-year-old. With stallions of his type and\r\nmares as wide, deep, and well-bred as Champion’s Choice (by Childwick\r\nChampion), Shires full of character should be forthcoming from these\r\nLancashire breeders.\r\n\r\nThe Carlton Stud continues to flourish, although its founder, the late\r\nMr. James Forshaw, departed this life in 1908. His business abilities\r\nand keen judgment have been inherited by his sons, one of whom judged\r\nin London last year (1914), as his father did in 1900. This being a\r\nrecord in Shire Horse history for father and son to judge at the great\r\nShow of the breed.\r\n\r\nCarlton has always been famous for its stallions. It has furnished\r\nLondon winners from the first, including the Champions Stroxton Tom\r\n(1902 and 1903), Present King II. (1906), and Stolen Duchess, the\r\nChallenge Cup winning mare of 1907.\r\n\r\nThe sires owned by the late Mr. Forshaw and his sons are too numerous\r\nto mention in detail. Bar None is spoken of elsewhere. Another very\r\nimpressive stallion was What’s Wanted, the sire of Mr. A. C. Duncombe’s\r\nPremier (also mentioned in another chapter), and a large family of\r\ncelebrated sons. His great grandsire was (Dack’s) Matchless 1509, a\r\ngreat sire in the Fen country, which travelled through Moulton Eaugate\r\nfor thirteen consecutive seasons. The late Mr. Forshaw’s opinion\r\nof him is given on another page. One of the most successful Carlton\r\nsires of recent years has been Drayman XXIII., whose son, Tatton Dray\r\nKing, won highest honours in London, and realized 3700 guineas when\r\nsold. Seeing that prizes were being won by stallions from this stud\r\nthrough several decades of last century, and that a large number have\r\nbeen travelled each season since, while a very large export trade has\r\nbeen done by Messrs. Forshaw and Sons, it need hardly be said that the\r\ninfluence of this stud has been world-wide.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to mention all the existing studs in a little book\r\nlike this, but three others will be now mentioned for the reason that\r\nthey are carried on by those who formerly managed successful studs,\r\ntherefore they have “kept the ball rolling,” viz. that of Mr. Thomas\r\nEwart, at Dunsmore, who made purchases on his own behalf when the stud\r\nof the late Sir P. A. Muntz--which he had managed for so long--was\r\ndispersed, and has since brought out many winners, the most famous of\r\nwhich is Dunsmore Chessie. Mr. R. H. Keene, under whose care the Shires\r\nof Mr. R. W. Hudson (Past-President of the Shire Horse Society) at\r\nDanesfield attained to such prominence, although not actually taking\r\nover the prefix, took a large portion of the land, and carries on Shire\r\nbreeding quite successfully on his own account.\r\n\r\nThe other of this class to be named is Mr. C. E. McKenna, who took over\r\nthe Bardon stud from Mr. B. N. Everard when the latter decided to let\r\nthe Leicestershire stud farm where Lockinge Forest King spent his last\r\nand worthiest years. Such enterprise gives farmers and men of moderate\r\nmeans faith in the great and growing industry of Shire Horse breeding.\r\n\r\nOf stud owners who have climbed to prominence, although neither\r\nlandowners, merchant princes, nor erstwhile stud managers, may be\r\nmentioned Mr. James Gould, Crouchley Lymm, Cheshire, whose Snowdon\r\nMenestrel was first in his class and reserve for the Stallion Cup at\r\nthe 1914 London Show; Messrs. E. and J. Whinnerah, Warton, Carnforth,\r\nwho won seventh prize with Warton Draughtsman in 1910, afterwards\r\nselling him to the Duke of Devonshire, who reached the top of the tree\r\nwith him two years later.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Mackereth, the new London judge of 1915, entered the\r\nexhibitors’ list at the London Show of 1899. Perhaps his most notable\r\nhorse is Lunesdale Kingmaker, with which Lord Rothschild won fourth\r\nprize in 1907, he being the sire of Messrs. Potter’s King’s Choice\r\nabove mentioned.\r\n\r\nMany other studs well meriting notice could be dealt with did time and\r\nspace permit, including that of a tenant farmer who named one of his\r\nbest colts “Sign of Riches,” which must be regarded as an advertisement\r\nfor the breed from a farmer’s point of view.\r\n\r\nOf past studs only one will be mentioned, that of the late Sir Walter\r\nGilbey, the dispersal having taken place on January 13, 1915. The first\r\nShire sale at Elsenham was held in 1885--thirty years ago--when the\r\nlate Lord Wantage gave the highest price, 475 guineas, for Glow, by\r\nSpark, the average of £172 4_s._ 6_d._ being unbeaten till the Scawby\r\nsale of 1891 (which was £198 17_s._ 3_d._).\r\n\r\nSir Walter has been mentioned as one of the founders of the Shire Horse\r\nSociety; his services in aid of horse breeding were recognized by\r\npresenting him with his portrait in oils, the subscribers numbering\r\n1250. The presentation was made by King Edward (then Prince of Wales)\r\nat the London Show of 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OUTLOOK\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is written when war, and all that pertains to it, is the\r\nabsorbing topic. In fact, no other will be listened to. What is\r\nthe good of talking about such a peaceful occupation as that of\r\nagriculture while the nation is fighting for its very existence? To a\r\ncertain extent this can be understood, but stock breeding, and more\r\nparticularly horse breeding, cannot be suspended for two or three\r\nseasons and then resumed without causing a gap in the supply of horses\r\ncoming along for future use.\r\n\r\nThe cry of the army authorities is for “more and more men,” together\r\nwith a demand for a constant supply of horses of many types, including\r\nthe weight-moving War Horse, and if the supply is used up, with no\r\nprovision being made for a quantity of four-footed recruits to haul the\r\nguns or baggage waggons in the days to come, the British Army, and\r\nmost others, will be faced with a problem not easily solved.\r\n\r\nThe motor-mad mechanic may think that his chance has come, but generals\r\nwho have to lead an army over water-logged plains, or snow-covered\r\nmountains, will demand horses, hitherto--and henceforth--indispensable\r\nfor mounting soldiers on, rushing their guns quickly into position, or\r\ndrawing their food supplies and munitions of war after them.\r\n\r\nWhen the mechanic has provided horseless vehicles to do all this,\r\nhorse breeding can be ignored by fighting men--not before. But horses,\r\nparticularly draft horses, are needed for commercial use. So far, coal\r\nmerchants are horse users, while brewers, millers, and other lorry\r\nusers have not altogether discarded the horse-drawn vehicle.\r\n\r\nFor taking loads to and from the landing stage at Liverpool heavy\r\nhorses will be in great demand after the war--perhaps greater than they\r\nhave ever been. The railways will continue to exist, and, while they\r\ndo, powerful Shire geldings must be employed; no other can put the\r\nnecessary weight into the collar for shunting loaded trucks.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn of 1914 no other kind of advice--although they got\r\nplenty of it--was so freely and so frequently given to farmers as this,\r\n“grow more wheat.”\r\n\r\nIf this has been acted upon, and there is no doubt that it has, at\r\nleast to some extent, it follows, as sure as the night follows the day,\r\nthat more horses will be required by those who grow the wheat. The land\r\nhas to be ploughed and cultivated, the crop drilled, cut, carted home\r\nand delivered to mill, or railway truck, all meaning horse labour.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that large farmers will use motor ploughs or steam\r\nwaggons, but these are beyond the reach of the average English farmer.\r\nMoreover, when bought they depreciate in value, whether working or\r\nstanding idle, which is exactly what the Shire gelding or brood mare\r\ndoes not do. If properly cared for and used they appreciate in value\r\nfrom the time they are put to work until they are six or seven years\r\nold, and by that age most farmers have sold their non-breeders to make\r\nroom for younger animals. Horse power is therefore the cheapest and\r\nmost satisfactory power for most farmers to use in front of field\r\nimplements and farm waggons, a fact which is bound to tell in favour of\r\nthe Shire in the coming times of peace which we anticipate.\r\n\r\nWhen awarding prizes for the best managed farm, the judges appointed by\r\nthe Royal Agricultural Society of England are instructed to consider--\r\n\r\n“General Management with a view to profit,” so that any breed of live\r\nstock which leaves a profit would help a competitor.\r\n\r\nOnly a short time ago a Warwickshire tenant farmer told his landlord\r\nthat Shire horses had enabled himself and many others to attend the\r\nrent audit, “with a smile on his face and the rent in his pocket.”\r\n\r\nMost landlords are prepared to welcome a tenant in that state,\r\ntherefore they should continue to encourage the industry as they have\r\ndone during the past twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nWars come to an end--the “Thirty Years’ War” did--so let us remember\r\nthe Divine promise to Noah after the flood, “While the earth remaineth\r\nseedtime and harvest … shall not cease,” Gen. 8:22. As long as there is\r\nsowing and reaping to be done horses--Shire horses--will be wanted.\r\n\r\n    “Far back in the ages\r\n      The plough with wreaths was crowned;\r\n    The hands of kings and sages\r\n      Entwined the chaplet round;\r\n    Till men of spoil disdained the toil\r\n      By which the world was nourished,\r\n    And dews of blood enriched the soil\r\n      Where green their laurels flourished:\r\n    Now the world her fault repairs--\r\n      The guilt that stains her story;\r\n    And weeps; her crimes amid the cares\r\n      That formed her earliest glory.\r\n    The glory, earned in deadly fray,\r\n      Shall fade, decay and perish.\r\n    Honour waits, o’er all the Earth\r\n      Through endless generations,\r\n    The art that calls her harvests forth\r\n      And feeds the expectant nations.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    A\r\n\r\n    Alston Rose, champion mare 1901 … 104\r\n\r\n    Armour-clad warriors, 1, 7\r\n\r\n    Army horses, 6\r\n\r\n    Ashbourne Foal Show, 80\r\n\r\n    Attention to feet, 42\r\n\r\n    Aurea, champion mare, 18, 65\r\n\r\n    Author’s Preface, v\r\n\r\n    Average prices, 76\r\n\r\n\r\n    B\r\n\r\n    Back breeding, value of, 11, 13, 39\r\n\r\n    Bakewell, Robert, 2, 22, 54\r\n\r\n    Bardon Extraordinary, champion gelding, 65, 78\r\n\r\n    Bardon Stud, 118\r\n\r\n    Bar None, 80\r\n\r\n    Bearwardcote Blaze, 60\r\n\r\n    Bedding, 35\r\n\r\n    Birdsall Menestrel, 84, 111\r\n\r\n    ---- stud, 110\r\n\r\n    Black horses, Bakewell’s, 55\r\n\r\n    Black horses from Flanders, 58\r\n\r\n    Blagdon Stud, 110\r\n\r\n    Blending Shire and Clydesdale breeds, 59\r\n\r\n    Boiled barley, 36\r\n\r\n    Bradley, Mr. John, 83\r\n\r\n    Bramhope stud, 111\r\n\r\n    Breeders, farmer, 27\r\n\r\n    Breeders, prizes for, 65\r\n\r\n    Breeding from fillies, 17\r\n\r\n    Breeding, time for, 31\r\n\r\n    Bury Victor Chief, champion in 1892 … 68, 69\r\n\r\n    Buscot Harold, champion stallion, 17, 65\r\n\r\n\r\n    C\r\n\r\n    Calwich Stud, 61, 80\r\n\r\n    Canada, 101\r\n\r\n    Carbonite, 103\r\n\r\n    Care of the feet, 42\r\n\r\n    Carlton Stud, 116\r\n\r\n    Cart-colts, 23\r\n\r\n    Cart-horses, 54\r\n\r\n    Castrating colts, 39\r\n\r\n    Certificate of Soundness, 62\r\n\r\n    Champion’s Goalkeeper, champion in 1913 and 1914 … 67, 104\r\n\r\n    Champions bred at Sandringham, 3\r\n\r\n    Cheap sires, 12\r\n\r\n    Clark, Mr. A.
