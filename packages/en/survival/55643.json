A.\r\nSpender. They were continued in subsequent years, in conjunction\r\nwith the London School of Economics, and the results were summarised\r\nin a thesis entitled “The Enclosure of Common Fields in England in\r\nthe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries,” which was submitted to\r\nthe University of London in 1904, and approved as a thesis for the\r\ndegree of Doctor of Science in Economics. That thesis consisted in the\r\nfirst place of a series of maps, partially reproduced in this volume\r\nthrough the kind assistance of the Royal Geographical Society; and\r\nin the second place of manuscript matter which has been revised for\r\npublication in the form of this volume and under the present title. The\r\noriginal maps are in the custody of the London School of Economics, and\r\ncan be seen by those who desire to examine them. They include a series\r\nof county maps, on which parishes in which common fields have been\r\nenclosed by Act of Parliament are coloured and marked according to the\r\ndate of enclosure, and maps illustrating the process of Parliamentary\r\nenclosure, and the working of the common field system. Those who are\r\ninterested in the enclosure history of any particular county may also\r\nbe recommended to consult the Victoria County History.\r\n\r\nIt is my pleasant duty here to gratefully acknowledge my obligations\r\nto the two gentlemen above mentioned for the original impulse to\r\nstudy the process of the destruction and decay of English village\r\ncommunities; to the London School of Economics; and in particular to\r\nits first Director, Mr. W. A. S. Hewins, its present Director, Mr.\r\nH. J. Mackinder, and Mr. Hubert Hall, for assistance, encouragement,\r\nand advice; to many labourers, farmers, clergymen, and other rural\r\nresidents, for information and personal kindness; to the Royal\r\nGeographical Society for defraying the cost of the production of\r\nthe blocks of the illustrative maps herewith published; and to Earl\r\nCarrington, the President of the Board of Agriculture, for reading the\r\nbook in proof, and recommending it to those who are willing to study\r\nrural history because they desire to improve rural conditions of life.\r\n\r\nIn writing this book I have deemed it a matter of conscience to\r\npreserve the attitude of mind of the student of history, pure and\r\nsimple. I have felt, and feel, that historical investigation can only\r\nbe rightly carried on when all motives except the simple desire to\r\nknow the truth are excluded from the investigator’s mind. Yet the\r\ninvestigation undertaken having been thus far completed, and its\r\nresults placed on record, I cannot refrain from attempting to read out\r\nof them some lessons for the present and the future.\r\n\r\nMy conclusions have been in large measure expressed for me by Lord\r\nCarrington’s Introduction. The policy of the legislature and of the\r\nCentral Government, expressed in the Enclosure Acts of the eighteenth\r\nand nineteenth centuries, though it claimed, and on the whole rightly\r\nclaimed, that it effected an immediate and great increase in the\r\ncountry’s output of agricultural produce, and an improvement in the\r\nbreeds of sheep and cattle, was nevertheless essentially a policy\r\ndirected towards the enhancement of agricultural rents, the building up\r\nof large and compact landed estates, the establishment of capitalist\r\nfarming, the uprooting of peasant proprietors and of small holdings\r\ntogether with the communal use of land, and the multiplication of\r\nthe class of landless agricultural labourers. There is need in the\r\ntwentieth century for a new agricultural policy. As I read the economic\r\nsigns of the time, industrial conditions are beginning to favour a\r\ngreat agricultural revival in the British Isles. A wise programme of\r\nrural reform is necessary both in order that the possible agricultural\r\nprosperity may be secured, and in order that the nation may reap in\r\nfull its possible fruits of physical and moral well-being for the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn all times the fading memories and traditions of the past have\r\ncontributed to form in men’s minds the ideals of a possible better\r\nfuture state of society which are the inspiration of progress. The\r\nmemories and traditions of the English village community, together with\r\nits visible relics in the form of commons, commonable meadows, and\r\n(rarely) common fields, have had their influence on the formation of\r\nthe ideals of the Labour and Democratic movement of our country from\r\nthe time of Cobbett onwards. Through historical research the past may\r\nbecome more definitely suggestive.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions borne into my mind for the agricultural policy of the\r\ntwentieth century may be summed up in the phrase, British agriculture\r\nmust be democratised. By this I mean that the principle of collective\r\nownership of the soil must be established or re-established; that\r\nagricultural co-operation must be revived in new forms suitable to\r\nmodern conditions; that the ancient right of independent access to\r\nthe soil for every tiller of it must be restored; that a career of\r\nindustrial advance in agriculture must be made possible for the\r\ncompetent worker. On one important side of the life of the old English\r\nvillage community I have not touched at all in this book, viz., its\r\nsocial and recreative side. In this respect also the losses of the\r\npast will probably be recovered spontaneously if the nation aims in\r\nits agricultural policy at the three essentials of wholesome, hopeful,\r\nhuman work, as opposed to dehumanised toil, Freedom, Training and\r\nMutual Aid.\r\n\r\n  GILBERT SLATER.\r\n\r\n  _January 10th, 1907._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

But in recent\r\nyears social reformers have come to see that the solution of many of\r\nthe problems of the town is to be found in the country, and increasing\r\nattention is being paid to the causes of the rural exodus and the\r\nbest means by which it can be arrested. No industry can be in a\r\nhealthy condition which does not provide an opportunity for the small\r\nman to improve his position; and consequently such questions as the\r\nprovision of allotments and small holdings, agricultural co-operation,\r\nthe preservation of the independence of spirit of the agricultural\r\nlabourer, and the securing for him the prospect of a continually\r\nadvancing career on the land are recognised as matters of urgent\r\nnational importance.\r\n\r\nIn this book Dr. Slater shows that the movement for the enclosure of\r\narable open and common fields has been a movement for the sweeping\r\naway of small holdings and small properties; that the “Village\r\nCommunity” which any Enclosure Act of this character abolished was\r\nessentially an organisation for agricultural co-operation. He shows\r\nthat at least in certain parts of the country even in comparatively\r\nrecent times enclosure has produced rural depopulation, and has\r\nconverted the villager from “a peasant with a mediæval status to an\r\nagricultural labourer entirely dependent on a weekly wage.” He further\r\nmakes us doubt whether these little village revolutions, while they\r\ntemporarily stimulated agricultural progress by facilitating improved\r\nstock-breeding and the economy of labour, did not also to a certain\r\nextent destroy the opportunities of future progress by separating\r\nfarmer from labourer by a gulf difficult to cross, and thus cutting off\r\nthe supply of new recruits to the farming class.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, whatever reasons there may be for regretting the\r\nenclosure of our Common Fields, and for wishing that the interests\r\nof the humbler tillers of the soil had been more sedulously guarded\r\non enclosure, in the main the process was inevitable. Common field\r\nAgriculture was a survival of customs and institutions which had grown\r\nup when each village lived its life to a great extent in isolation.\r\nIt was necessary that the villager should almost forget that he was\r\na Little Pedlingtonian to realise that he was an Englishman. Village\r\npatriotism had to die down temporarily to make way for national\r\npatriotism; and when the spirit died out of the Village Community its\r\nform could not be preserved.\r\n\r\nNow and in the future there is need that local patriotism, pride\r\nin the local community, and willingness to serve it, whether it be\r\nvillage or city, should be kindled again to its old vigour. With the\r\nrevival of the spirit will come a revival of some of the old forms of\r\nvillage common life, and a creation of new forms in place of those\r\nwhich will remain among the forgotten facts of the past. The Village\r\nCommunity is a hope of the future as well as a memory of the past,\r\nand therefore those who are interested in the movement for reviving\r\nBritish Agriculture on democratic lines and for improving the social\r\nand economic conditions of our villages have reason to welcome Dr.\r\nSlater’s attempt to describe existing and recent survivals of the\r\nEnglish Village Community, and to ascertain the circumstances, causes,\r\nand consequences of its gradual extinction.\r\n\r\n  CARRINGTON.\r\n\r\n  _28th November, 1906._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH PEASANTRY AND THE ENCLOSURE OF COMMON FIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nENCLOSURE IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe internal history of our villages is a more obscure, but not less\r\nimportant a part of English history, than the internal history of our\r\ntowns. It is, indeed, more fundamental. A town is ordinarily by origin\r\nan overgrown village, which never loses the marks of its origin. And\r\nit was by agricultural and social changes in the villages that the way\r\nwas prepared for the great industrial revolution, or more properly,\r\nevolution, which is the underlying fact of the history of English\r\ntowns, especially during the last two centuries.\r\n\r\nThe central fact in the history of any English village since\r\nthe Middle Ages, is expressed in the word “enclosure.” Primarily\r\n“enclosure” means surrounding a piece of land with hedges, ditches, or\r\nother barriers to the free passage of men and animals. Agriculturally,\r\nenclosure of arable land in the midst of unenclosed arable land is\r\na preliminary step to its conversion into pasture, the hedge is\r\nerected to keep animals in; enclosure of land in the midst of open\r\ncommon pasture is a preliminary step to tillage, the hedge keeps\r\nanimals out. But in either case the hedge is the mark and sign of\r\nexclusive ownership and occupation in the land which is hedged. Hence\r\nby enclosure collective use, usually accompanied by some degree of\r\ncommunity of ownership, of the piece of land enclosed, is abolished,\r\nand superseded by individual ownership and separate occupation.\r\n\r\nThe form of enclosure which is familiar to our minds is the enclosure\r\nof land previously uncultivated; in the legal phrase, “enclosure of\r\nwaste of a manor,” in the ordinary phrase, “enclosure of commons.”\r\nEnclosure in this sense has been, and is still, a matter of very\r\nvital interest to the urban population, a fact which might be brought\r\nvividly to our minds by a recital of the commons within London and\r\nits immediate neighbourhood which have been lost or preserved with\r\ndifficulty. It is sufficient to refer to Epping Forest, Hadley Wood,\r\nHampstead Heath, Wimbledon Common, Hayes and Keston Commons, Bostall\r\nHeath and Plumstead Common.\r\n\r\nFar more important from a broad national point of view, is the\r\nenclosure of common fields--the enclosure, that is, of land previously\r\ncultivated according to a system which did not involve the separation\r\nof one holding from another by any tangible barrier. Enclosure of this\r\nsort, when suddenly effected, as by a Private Act of Enclosure, is\r\nrightly termed the extinction of a village community. In the following\r\nchapters it will be shown in detail from existing and recent survivals,\r\nwhat was the nature of the system of cultivation in open and common\r\nfields in different parts of England, up to the time of enclosure;\r\nthe question when and how enclosure was brought about in different\r\ncounties will be discussed; and light will be thrown upon the result\r\nof the transition from the medieval to the modern system of village\r\nlife upon the material and moral condition of the villagers, the\r\npeasants, farmers or labourers, who underwent the change. In these\r\nchapters facts drawn directly from observations and inquiries in the\r\nvillages themselves, from the observations of agricultural writers who\r\nspeak from direct and intimate knowledge, and from the Enclosure Acts,\r\nwill be left in the main to tell their own story. But a generalised\r\nstatement will perhaps make that story clearer.\r\n\r\nHere is a typical Enclosure Act of the type which encloses common\r\nfields, taken at random, and a good example of the 2565 Acts of its\r\nclass enumerated in the Appendix, by which about 3000 parishes were\r\nenclosed. It was passed in 1795 (c. 43) and begins:--“Whereas there\r\nare in the parish of Henlow, in the County of Bedford, divers Open and\r\nCommon Fields, Meadows, Pastures, Waste Lands, and other Commonable\r\nLands and Grounds, containing by estimation, Two Thousand Acres, or\r\nthereabouts.... And whereas the said Open and Common Fields, Lands,\r\nGrounds, Meadows and Pastures, lie intermixed, and are inconveniently\r\nsituated, and are in their present state incapable of Improvement,\r\nand the several Proprietors thereof and Persons interested therein\r\nare desirous that the same may be divided and enclosed, and specific\r\nShares thereof set out and allotted in Lieu and in Proportion to their\r\nseveral and respective Estates, Rights, and Interests therein; but such\r\nDivision and Inclosure cannot be effected without the Aid and Authority\r\nof Parliament. May it therefore please your Majesty----.”\r\n\r\nThe total area of the parish of Henlow is 2450 acres, and it has\r\na large park. It appears, therefore, that when the Act was passed\r\npractically the whole of the arable, meadow, and pasture land in the\r\nparish lay entirely open, and was commonable. The more remote and least\r\ncultivable parts of the parish were, no doubt, common pastures; on\r\nthese the villagers kept flocks and herds according to some recognised\r\nrule based on the sizes of their holdings in the arable fields. A\r\ndrift would lead from the common to the village, passing through\r\nthe arable fields, and fenced or hedged off from them. Immediately\r\nbehind the cottages, clustering together to form the village, there\r\nwould be small closes for gardens or paddocks; beyond these all round\r\nthe village would stretch the open, common, arable fields, in area\r\nprobably considerably more than half the parish. These were probably\r\ndivided into three or four approximately equal portions, and cultivated\r\naccording to a three or four year course, imposed rigidly on all\r\noccupiers by a mutual agreement sanctioned by custom. The holdings\r\nwould be of various sizes, from three or four acres of arable land\r\nupwards, but all small; and a holding of, say, twenty acres of arable\r\nland would consist of about thirty separate strips of land of from half\r\nan acre to an acre each, scattered over all the three or four arable\r\nfields, but approximately equally divided between each field, so that\r\neach year the occupier would have, for example, about five acres under\r\nwheat, five under barley, five under pulse, and five fallow, provided\r\nthat were the customary course of husbandry. Right through the year the\r\nfallow land would be used as common pasture, and the land under crops\r\nwould become commonable after the crops were carried.\r\n\r\nAlong the streams flowing into the river Ivel would be the open\r\ncommonable meadows. These would be divided into a number of plots,\r\nhalf-acres, quarter-acres, or even smaller, marked by pegs driven\r\nin the ground, or stones; and a certain number of these plots were\r\nassigned to each holding, in proportion to the amount of arable land.\r\nDuring the spring, while the cattle were on the common pasture, the\r\nmeadow would be let grow for hay; when the time for hay harvest came,\r\neach peasant cut his own plots, and the meadow became commonable during\r\nthe rest of the summer. Some of the peasant occupiers would be small\r\nfreeholders, some probably copyholders, others legally annual tenants.\r\nAll would meet together on certain occasions to settle questions of\r\ncommon interest.\r\n\r\nWe might say, though the expression must not be too rigidly\r\ninterpreted, that under the common field system the parish, township,\r\nor hamlet formed one farm, occupied and cultivated by a group of\r\npartners holding varying numbers of shares. It may well be imagined\r\nwhat a village cataclysm took place when an Act for the enclosure of\r\nthe parish was passed, and commissioners descended upon the village,\r\nvalued every property and every common right, and carved out the whole\r\nparish into rectangles, instituting the modern system of separate\r\nexclusive ownership and individual cultivation. We shall see that\r\nordinarily the holdings on enclosure became fewer and larger, that\r\nvery many of the peasants were in consequence driven from the village,\r\nor became landless, pauperised agricultural labourers. We shall see\r\nalso that the traditions of the common field system where they have\r\nperished as distinct memories, have survived in the form of aspirations\r\nfor agricultural reform. In fact, the great rural question for the\r\ntwentieth century to determine, is whether there were not beneath the\r\ninconvenient and uneconomical methods of the common field system, a\r\nvital principle essential to true rural prosperity, which has to be\r\nre-discovered and re-established in forms suitable to the present\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended in this book to go into the vexed question of the\r\norigin of the common field system, or of the English village community.\r\nIt will be noticed that the researches upon which this book is based\r\ndo not as a rule go further back than Leland’s Itinerary in 1536 and\r\nfollowing years. From such materials only hypotheses can be obtained,\r\nwhich require to be tested by all the evidence from earlier records. A\r\nhypothesis, however, has a certain value as a mental thread by which\r\nthe facts can be connected and more clearly conceived.\r\n\r\nJudging entirely from eighteenth and nineteenth century evidence,\r\none is in the first place driven to accept most unhesitatingly the\r\nprevailing theory that the English common field system was based on\r\nco-aration. But one is tempted to very summarily dismiss the theory\r\nof Roman origin. Rather one is inclined to say that as long as a\r\nconsiderable portion of the villagers of the parish were accustomed to\r\nyoke their oxen or harness their horses to a common plough, the system\r\nwas a living one, capable of growth and modification according to the\r\nideas of the people who worked it. It became, as it were, fossilised\r\nand dead, incapable of other than decaying change, when each occupier\r\ncultivated his own set of strips of land by his own plough or his own\r\nspade. One is therefore inclined to suppose that the introduction of\r\neach new element in the population of a village--Saxon, Angle, Dane,\r\nand in a less degree, Norman--profoundly modified earlier customs, and\r\nthat in each part of Britain a local type of village community resulted\r\nfrom the blending of different racial traditions.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis is directly suggested by the evidence of recent\r\nsurvivals. The most familiar type of village community is\r\ncharacteristic of the Midlands; I have termed it the Mercian type.\r\nIt is most easily conceived as a compound of the pure Keltic system,\r\nknown in the Highlands and Ireland as Run-rig or Rundale, and the North\r\nGerman system traditional among the Angles, in which the two elements\r\nin equal strength are very perfectly blended together. In the South of\r\nEngland we find a different type, here termed the Wessex type, in which\r\nthe influence of Keltic tradition is more strongly seen. The village\r\ncommunity in Norfolk and the adjoining part of Suffolk shows some\r\nremarkable special features, traces of which are found in adjoining\r\ncounties, but which appear to be easily accounted for as the result of\r\nthe later intrusion of Scandinavian traditions. Further, throughout\r\nthe West of England, from Cumberland to Devon and Cornwall, we find\r\nevidence that the primitive type of village community approximated very\r\nclosely to the Keltic Run-rig.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure of the common fields, meadows and pastures, of any particular\r\nvillage may have taken place in the following ways:--\r\n\r\n(1) By Act of Parliament, viz., (_a_) by a private Act, (_b_) under the\r\nauthority of the General Enclosure Acts of 1830 and 1836, (_c_) by the\r\nEnclosure Commissioners and their successors, the Board of Agriculture,\r\nunder the General Enclosure Act of 1845 and its amending Acts.\r\n\r\n(2) By common agreement of all the collective owners.\r\n\r\n(3) By the purchase on the part of one owner of all conflicting rights.\r\n\r\n(4) By special licence of the Tudor monarchs.\r\n\r\n(5) By various forms of force and fraud.\r\n\r\nCommonable waste may have been enclosed in any of the above ways, and\r\nalso under the Statutes of Merton and Winchester (1235 and 1285), which\r\ngive Lords of the Manor the right of enclosing commons provided proof\r\nis given that the tenants of the manor are left sufficient pasture.\r\n\r\nEnquiry into the history of Enclosure naturally begins with an\r\nexamination of the Enclosure Acts.\r\n\r\nThe first fact elicited by this examination is that there is a perfect\r\n_legal_ similarity between Acts for enclosing commonable waste, which\r\nmay be termed _Acts for extending cultivation_, and Acts such as\r\nthat for Henlow, for enclosing all the open and common arable and\r\nother lands of a parish or parishes, which may be termed _Acts for\r\nextinguishing village communities_. About one-third of the Enclosure\r\nActs belong to the former variety, about two-thirds to the latter.\r\nAs from the economic and social points of view, the two classes of\r\nEnclosure Acts are as widely different as they are legally similar, no\r\nstatistical summaries of the Acts can have much value until the two\r\nclasses are sorted out. To do this involved a separate examination of\r\nall the Acts accessible.\r\n\r\nAppendix A contains a statistical summary of the Acts for enclosing\r\ncommonable waste passed between 1727 and 1845; Appendix B contains a\r\nlist of Acts for enclosing common arable fields with or without other\r\ncommonable lands passed between 1727 and 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE MERCIAN TYPE OF VILLAGE COMMUNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAXTON, AN OPEN FIELD PARISH.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best surviving example of an open field parish is that of\r\nLaxton, or Lexington, in Nottinghamshire, about ten miles from Newark\r\nand Southwell. It lies remote from railways and high roads, and is\r\nonly to be reached by bye roads. From whatever quarter one approaches\r\nthe village, one enters the parish through a gate. The village is in\r\nthe centre of the parish, and is surrounded by enclosed fields. Other\r\nenclosures are to be found on the most remote parts of the parish,\r\nin some cases representing, apparently, old woodland which has been\r\nconverted into tillage or pasture; in other cases portions of the\r\narable fields. But nearly half the area of the parish remains in the\r\nform of two great arable fields, and two smaller ones which are treated\r\nas two parts of the third field. The different holdings, whether small\r\nfreeholds or farms rented from the Lord of the Manor, who owns nearly\r\nall the parish, consist, in part, of strips of land scattered all over\r\nthese fields, in a manner which can best be understood by reference\r\nto the map. Within these arable fields cultivation is not carried on\r\naccording to the discretion of the individual farmer, but by strict\r\nrules of great antiquity. In each of the fields a three year course is\r\nrigidly adhered to.\r\n\r\nFirst year, wheat.\r\n\r\nSecond year, spring corn (_i.e._ barley, oats, peas, beans, vetches,\r\ntares, &c.).\r\n\r\nThird year, fallow.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, Laxton be visited early in June, the following\r\ndescription of the appearance of the parish will be found correct. The\r\ntraveller passes through the boundary gate. He finds his road leads him\r\nthrough the “Spring corn” field, which lies open on either side of the\r\nroad. A phrase which is continually used by old farmers when attempting\r\nto describe common fields will probably occur to him in this field:\r\n“It is like allotments.” But it is like an allotment field with many\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAXTON\r\n\r\n  WEST FIELD AND PART OF MILL FIELD\r\n\r\n  Map of Laxton showing:\r\n    Common Pasture\r\n    Farm nᵒ. 1\r\n    Farm nᵒ. 2\r\n  Approximate Scale 1:9,000]\r\n\r\nAll the great field is divided up into oblong patches, each patch\r\ngrowing its own crop, but with no more division or boundary between one\r\ncrop and the next than a mere furrow.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the traveller looks again at a strip of land growing, say,\r\nbeans, he will find that this strip consists of one, two, or more\r\nridges, locally termed “lands.” A “land” in Laxton has a pretty\r\nuniform width of 5½ yards, and a normal length of one furlong; but by\r\nthe necessity of the case the length varies considerably. Owing to\r\nthis variation in length the various strips of land which make up the\r\ndifferent holdings in the common fields, when their area is expressed\r\nin acres, roods, or poles, seem to have no common measure.\r\n\r\nBecause the soil of Laxton is a heavy clay it is customary to plough\r\neach “land” every year in the same manner, beginning at the edges, and\r\nturning the sod towards the centre of the “land.” Hence each “land”\r\nforms a long narrow ridge, heaped up in the middle, and the lie of the\r\n“lands” or ridges was at some unknown date so well contrived for the\r\nproper drainage of the land, that it is probable that if the whole of\r\na field were let to a single farmer, he would still plough so as to\r\nmaintain the old ridges.\r\n\r\nThe same ridges are to be found on the other two fields, one of which\r\nis a stretch of waving wheat; while the third, or fallow field, is\r\nbeing leisurely ploughed, a number of sheep getting a difficult living\r\nfrom the thistles and other weeds in the still unploughed portions,\r\nand on the “sicks,” _i.e._ certain grassy parts of the field which are\r\ndefined by boundary marks, and are never allowed to be ploughed. In one\r\nextreme corner of the parish is Laxton Heath, a somewhat swampy common\r\ncovered with coarse grass. Here, too, sheep are grazed in common,\r\naccording to a “stint” somewhat recently determined upon. Before the\r\nstint was agreed to, every commoner had the right of turning out as\r\nmany sheep as he could feed in winter, the result being that the common\r\nwas overstocked, and the sheep nearly starved. The stint regulates\r\nthe number of sheep each commoner may graze upon the common according\r\nto the number he can feed on his other land in the parish. It was not\r\nadopted without opposition on the part of those whose privileges it\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the question, Who are the commoners? There are two\r\nsorts of claim by which a man may be entitled to common rights, and\r\nto a voice in such deliberations as those by which a stint is agreed\r\nto. One is by a holding in the common open fields, the other is by\r\nthe occupation of a “toft-head.” A “toft” is not very easy to define.\r\nOne may say that it either is, or represents, an ancient house or\r\ncottage in the village; but that immediately suggests the question, How\r\nancient? It is well known in the village which cottages are “tofts”\r\nand which are not. Those which are, command a rent about £2 a year\r\nhigher in consequence. It is to be noted that if the house or cottage\r\nwhich is the visible sign of “toft-head” be pulled down, and a new one\r\nerected on the same spot, the new house has the same rights attached\r\nto it. One is naturally led to the hypothesis that up to a certain\r\ndate[1] all cottages erected in Laxton carried common rights, but that\r\nafter that date no new common rights could be created. There are,\r\ntherefore, two classes of commoners: the farmers who hold land in the\r\ncommon fields, and the labourers who occupy the privileged cottages.\r\nA farmer may possess a number of common rights in respect of (1) his\r\nfarmhouse, if it be a “toft,” (2) his arable holding, and (3) any toft\r\ncottages he may own or rent and sub-let to labourers, retaining their\r\ncommon rights. The labourer has but one common right. Each common right\r\nentitles the holder to one vote, and to one share in the division of\r\nthe money revenues drawn from the commonable lands, besides the right\r\nof feeding an indefinite number of sheep on the fallow field, and the\r\nregulated number on the common. The money revenue that comes from the\r\ncommonable fields is obtained as follows: The grass lands (“sicks”)\r\nin the two common fields which are under crops cannot be grazed upon\r\nconveniently, because any animals would be liable to stray into the\r\ncrops. They are, therefore, mown for hay, and the right to mow them\r\nis sold by auction to one of the commoners, and the price realised is\r\ndivided. Recently this has worked out at about 14_s._ per common right.\r\nEach commoner also has the right of pasturing animals upon the two\r\nfields that are under crops, directly the harvest has been carried.\r\n\r\n [1] The following extract from a sixteenth century writer throws some\r\n light upon this point:\r\n\r\n    “Another disorder of oppression\r\n    aduerte this wone wiche is muche odyous,\r\n    A lord geauyn to private affection\r\n    lettinge the pooareman an olde rotten howse,\r\n    which hathe (to the same) profyttes commodious\r\n    its Cloase, and Common, with Lande in the feelde\r\n    but noate well heere howe the pooareman is peelde.\r\n\r\n    “The howse shall hee haue and A gardeyne plott,\r\n    but stonde he must to the reperation:\r\n    Close, Comon or Londe fallithe none to his lott;\r\n    that beste might helpe to his sustentation.\r\n    the whoale Rente payethe hee for his habitation,\r\n    as though hee dyd thappertenauncis possesse\r\n    Such soare oppression neadethe speadye redresse.”\r\n                “The Pleasaunt Poesye of Princelie Practise” (1548)\r\n                         WILLIAM FORREST, Chapter III., 21 & 22\r\n                         E.E.T.S. Extra Series, XXXII.\r\n\r\n We have here the practice of divorcing the cottage from its common\r\n right described as a novelty. The Act of 31 Elizabeth, c. 7, by\r\n prohibiting the letting of cottages without 4 acres of land, in effect\r\n prohibited the letting of a cottage without a common right, as the 4\r\n acres _would_ not be the highly valued Close, and _could_ not, unless\r\n the rights of other villagers were infringed, be waste or common\r\n pasture. Four acres in the common arable field was implied, and this\r\n of course carried a right of common.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of this right, which appears to be most keenly valued,\r\nas it is found to persist in many parishes after all other traces of\r\nthe common field system have died away, obviously opens the door to\r\nquarrels. It is not to be expected that all farmers should finish\r\ncarrying their crops on the same day; and the position of the man\r\nwho is behind all his neighbours, and so is standing between the\r\ncommoners and their right of pasture, is not an enviable one. But a\r\nconstitutional system of government exists for the purpose of dealing\r\nwith these and other difficulties. A “Foreman of the Fields” and a\r\n“Field Jury” are elected: the field jury settles all disputes between\r\nindividuals, while the duties of the foreman include that of issuing\r\nnotices to declare when the fields are open for pasturing; on which day\r\nall the gates, by which, as I have previously mentioned, the parish\r\nis entered, must be closed, while all the gates of the farmyards are\r\nthrown open, and a varied crowd of animals winds along the drifts and\r\nspreads over the fields.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the commonable lands of Laxton include only\r\narable fields and common pasture. The commonable meadows which the\r\nparish once had, have been partitioned and enclosed at a date beyond\r\nthe recollection of the oldest inhabitant. The neighbouring parish of\r\nEakring still has commonable meadows. In this respect Eakring is a more\r\nperfect example of the open field parish than Laxton, though its common\r\narable fields have been much more encroached upon; and have, in fact,\r\nbeen reduced to scattered fragments, so that the rector was unable to\r\ntell me whether there were five, six, or more of them. The villagers,\r\nhowever, say simply “Three: the wheat field, the bean field, and the\r\nfallow field.” The commonable meadows are, like the common fields, held\r\nin scattered strips intermingled; and are commonable after hay harvest.\r\nThe rule in Eakring is that if one man only has any hay left on the\r\nmeadows, the other commoners can turn in their cattle and relieve him\r\nof it; but if he can get a neighbour to leave but one haycock also, he\r\nis protected.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Eakring differs somewhat from that of Laxton.\r\nThere are regularly four toft meetings every year, presided over by\r\nthe steward of the lord of the manor, at which all questions relating\r\nto the commonable lands are settled. Further, all toft holders have an\r\nequal right to feed an indefinite number of sheep on the fallow field,\r\nand the other fields when available, but the exercise of the right is\r\nregulated by a species of auction. The number of sheep that can be\r\npastured with advantage is agreed upon, and since the total number of\r\nsheep which the assembled toft holders desire to put on is sure to\r\nexceed that number, a price to be charged per sheep is by degrees fixed\r\nby mutual bargaining, till the numbers of sheep for which their owners\r\nare willing to pay is reduced to the number that the pasture can bear.\r\nThe cottager and toft holder, therefore, who though not holding an acre\r\nof land in the parish, has yet enterprise enough to bid for the right\r\nof keeping a flock of sixty sheep on the common fields, is therefore\r\nheartily welcomed by that section of the toft holders who have no\r\ndesire to bid against him, because he forces up the value of their\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RECENT ENCLOSURE--CASTOR AND AILESWORTH.\r\n\r\nUp till 1898 an even better example of an open-field parish could be\r\nseen in Northamptonshire. In that year was completed the enclosure\r\nof Castor and Ailesworth, two hamlets forming part of the parish\r\nof Castor, situated three miles from Peterborough on the road to\r\nNorthampton. In 1892, when application was made to the Board of\r\nAgriculture, which now represents the Enclosure Commissioners of the\r\nGeneral Enclosure Act of 1845, there were in the two hamlets, out of\r\na total area of 4976 acres, 2,425 acres of common arable fields, 815\r\nacres of common pastures and meadows, and 370 acres of commonable\r\nwaste, and only about 1300 acres enclosed. In Laxton the commonable\r\nland is less than half the area of the parish. The greater amount of\r\nold enclosure in Laxton has had its effect on the distribution of the\r\npopulation. There are some, though very few, outlying farmhouses. In\r\nCastor and Ailesworth all the habitations and buildings, except a\r\nwatermill and a railway station, are clustered together in the two\r\nhamlets, which form one continuous village. At present very nearly all\r\nthe land of Laxton and Eakring is in the ownership of the respective\r\nlords of the two manors; in Castor and Ailesworth the Ecclesiastical\r\nCommissioners are the largest landowners; but nearly as much land is\r\nthe property of Earl Fitzwilliam, and there are besides a number of\r\nsmall landowners. Before enclosure all these properties were intermixed\r\nall over the area of the two hamlets, the two chief properties coming\r\nvery frequently in alternate strips.\r\n\r\nThough the area of commonable land in Castor was so much greater\r\nthan in Laxton, those customs of village communal life which we\r\nhave described had retained much less vigour; and to the decay of\r\nthe power of harmonious self-government the recent enclosure was\r\nmainly attributable. The customary method of cultivation in Castor\r\nand Ailesworth was a three-field system, but a different three-field\r\nsystem to that described above. The succession of crops was:--First\r\nyear, wheat; second year, barley; third year, a “fallow crop,” or as\r\nlocally pronounced, “follow crop.” Each year in the spring the farmers\r\nand toft-holders of Castor, and similarly of Ailesworth, would meet\r\nto decide the crop to be sown on the fallow field. One farmer, who\r\nheld the position--though not the title--of “Foreman of the Fields,”\r\nkept a “stint book,” a list of all the villagers owning common rights,\r\nand the number of rights belonging to each. The number of votes that\r\ncould be cast by each villager depended upon the number of his common\r\nrights. The fallow crop might be pulse or turnips or other roots or\r\nanything else that seemed advisable; but it was essential to the\r\n_farmers’_ interests that they should agree upon some crop. For a\r\ntradition existed in the village that unless the farmers were agreed\r\nas to the crop to be sown on the fallow field, that field could be\r\ntreated as though it really were fallow. It could be pastured on all\r\nthe year by all the toft-holders, and any crop which any farmer might\r\nsow would be at the mercy of his neighbours’ cattle and sheep. I could\r\nnot find that this had ever happened. On the other hand, the farmers\r\nbeing agreed about the crop, they could also determine the date when\r\nthe fallow field should become commonable.[2] The wheat-field and\r\nbarley-field became commonable after harvest; the meadows and pastures\r\nwere commonable between August 12th and February 14th.\r\n\r\n [2] This is good law. By 13 Geo. III. c. 81 these agreements could be\r\n made by “a three-fourths majority in number and value.” _See_ Chapter\r\n IX.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the medieval three-field system was retained in Laxton,\r\nbut was altered in Castor to an improved three-field system, is to\r\nbe found in the nature of the soil. That of Laxton is a heavy clay,\r\ngrowing wheat of noted quality; that of the Northamptonshire parish\r\nis lighter, in parts very shallow and stony. Another result of the\r\ndifference of soil was a different system of ploughing. The Castor\r\nmethod was that technically known as “Gathering and Splitting,” viz.,\r\nalternately to plough each strip from the margin inwards, turning the\r\nsod inwards, and the reverse way, turning the sod outwards, so that\r\nthe general level of the field was not broken into a series of ridges.\r\nIn Castor, as in Laxton, no grassy “balk” divided one man’s “land”\r\nfrom his neighbour’s, the furrow only had to serve as boundary, and\r\nsometimes the boundary was bitterly disputed. Before the enclosure\r\nthere was one spot in the common fields where two neighbours kept a\r\nplough each continually, and as fast as one ploughed certain furrows\r\ninto his land, the other ploughed them back into his.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty occasionally arose when high winds prevailed at\r\nharvest time. The great extent of the open fields, and the slightness\r\nof any opposition to the sweep of the wind, at such times allowed\r\nthe corn to be blown from one man’s land, and scattered over his\r\nneighbours’. Indeed it recently happened that one year when peas had\r\nbeen chosen as the fallow crop, that a storm carried the whole crop to\r\nthe hedge bordering the field, and so mixed together in inextricable\r\nconfusion the produce belonging to thirty or forty different farmers.\r\n\r\nAnother source of dispute was one that has been a prolific cause of\r\ntrouble in common fields for centuries. Where the extremities of a\r\nseries of adjoining “lands” abut on a land belonging to another series\r\nat a right angle, the land so abutted on is termed a “head-land,” and\r\nthe occupiers of the lands that abut on it have the right of turning\r\ntheir ploughs on the headland, and taking the plough from one strip to\r\nanother along it. The occupier of the headland therefore has to defer\r\nploughing it till all his neighbours have finished, and often chafes\r\nat the delay. Recently a farmer in the unenclosed parish of Elmstone\r\nHardwick, near Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire, attempted to find a\r\nremedy for this inconvenience. He ploughed his headland at the time\r\nthat suited his convenience, and then sued his neighbours for trespass\r\nwhen they turned their ploughs in his land. Needless to say he lost\r\nmore by his action than by the trespass.\r\n\r\nIn Castor quarrelsome farmers were wise enough to avoid the law\r\ncourts. Instead, they wrote appealing against their neighbours to\r\ntheir respective landlords, but the landowners were unable to restore\r\nharmony. The death of a farmer who had won the highest respect of his\r\nneighbours, and who had continually used his great influence to allay\r\nill-feeling and promote harmony, brought on a state of tension that\r\ngradually became unbearable; and the appointment by the Ecclesiastical\r\nCommissioners of a new agent, who could not understand and had no\r\npatience with the peculiarities of common-field farming, led to steps\r\nbeing taken for enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe first step necessary was to obtain the agreement of the great\r\nmajority of the people interested. The agent in question, assisted\r\nenergetically by the leading farmer in Ailesworth, succeeded in doing\r\nthis without much difficulty. In 1892, application was made for an\r\norder to the Board of Agriculture, whose inspector reported warmly\r\ncommending the project. The simple statement of the farmers with\r\nregard to their farms, _e.g._, “I hold 175 acres in 192 separate\r\nparcels,” would convince him that a change was necessary. The figures\r\nfor holdings are not given by the enclosure award, but a summary of\r\nthe facts with regard to some of the smaller properties gives the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n\r\nThe glebe consisted of--\r\n\r\n                                                       A.

That reckless disregard of the wider public interests\r\nboth of the locality and of the nation at large in the land to be\r\nenclosed of which the administration of the General Enclosure Act from\r\n1845 to 1874 has been accused, has been dispelled by the vigorous and\r\nably-conducted agitation to which we owe the preservation of Epping\r\nForest, Hampstead Heath, and many other priceless commons. In the\r\nenclosure of Castor and Ailesworth, in the first place, Ailesworth\r\nHeath, which occupies the highest and most remote corner of the\r\nparish, was excluded from the operation of the Enclosure Act. It is a\r\nwild little common which, beyond feeding a few sheep and furnishing\r\na quarry, seems to be fit for nothing but picnics and blackberrying.\r\nSituated at the distance of about five miles from Peterborough, which\r\nagain stands on the margin of the fen country, it will probably come to\r\nbe valued by the townsmen for its unprofitable wildness.\r\n\r\nNext, the parish boasts its antiquities, the remains of a part of the\r\nancient Roman road from London to York, and certain blocks of stone,\r\nlocally known as Robin Hood and Little John. The Enclosure Act provides\r\nfor the preservation of these.\r\n\r\nA bathing place in the River Nen, which bounds the parish on the\r\nsouth, selected at the most convenient spot, and three recreation\r\ngrounds of 6 acres each, and one of 14 acres, are handed over to the\r\nsafe keeping of the parish councils of Castor and Ailesworth, besides\r\nfour pieces of land, making 42 acres in all, for allotments and field\r\ngardens. The farmers mournfully point out that these 76 acres thus\r\nreserved for the common use and benefit of the villagers are some\r\nof the best land and the most conveniently situated. The recreation\r\ngrounds in particular they scorn as foolishness. Possibly, however,\r\nbecause the village prides itself on its prowess in the football field,\r\nthe indignation against this supposed fad of the central government\r\nis mild compared with that expressed by some of the thrifty people of\r\nUpton St. Leonards, near Gloucester, which was being enclosed at the\r\nsame time. Here the recreation ground was dubbed by some the “ruination\r\nground,” enticing as it did the young lads from digging in their\r\nfathers’ allotments to cricket and football, and so subverting the very\r\nfoundation of good morals.\r\n\r\nSubject to these deductions, the whole of the open commonable lands\r\nand many of the old enclosures, after being surveyed and valued, and\r\nafter roads, where necessary, had been diverted or newly set out,\r\nwere redistributed among the old proprietors so as to give each his\r\nproportional share, as far as possible in the most convenient manner.\r\nThis was both a lengthy and a delicate task, but it was finally\r\ncompleted in 1898, six years after the matter first came before the\r\nBoard of Agriculture. Each several proprietor was then required to\r\nfence his allotment in the manner prescribed by the commissioners who\r\nmake the survey and award. The cost of the survey and allotment usually\r\nworks out at about £1 per acre; the cost of fencing may be a great deal\r\nmore. Though the Parliamentary expenses are now trifling, the total\r\ncost of abolishing the “system of mingle-mangle,” as Carew called it in\r\n1600, in any parish where it still exists, is not to be lightly faced\r\nin times of agricultural depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE WESSEX TYPE OF VILLAGE COMMUNITY.\r\n\r\nTWO DORSET MANORS--STRATTON AND GRIMSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDorchester is bounded on the south by Fordington Field. The parish\r\nof Fordington, up to the year 1875, was unenclosed; it lay almost\r\nentirely open, and was divided into about eighty copyholds, intermixed\r\nand intercommonable, the manor belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall. But\r\nin 1875 the Duchy authorities bought out the copyholders, and the old\r\nsystem disappeared.\r\n\r\nAbout three or four miles from Dorchester, along the road to Maiden\r\nNewton and Yeovil, are the two adjoining villages of Stratton and\r\nGrimstone, forming together the Prebend of Stratton, belonging till\r\nrecently to the See of Sarum, which have only been enclosed since\r\n1900. The enclosure was effected without any Parliamentary sanction;\r\nit was brought about, I am told by the present lord of the two manors,\r\nby the refusal of the copyholders, who held by a tenure of lives, to\r\n“re-life.” In consequence, all the copyholds, except a few cottages,\r\nhave fallen into the hands of the lord of the manor; all Grimstone has\r\nbeen let to a single farmer, and Stratton divided into three or four\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nBesides the very late survival of the common field system in these two\r\nmanors, there are two other features which make them specially notable.\r\nIn the first place they are, agriculturally, thoroughly characteristic\r\nof the Wessex type of open field village, the type that prevailed\r\nover Berkshire, Hampshire, Wiltshire and Dorset. In the second place,\r\nthe manorial system of village government survived with equal vigour;\r\nthe proceedings of the manorial courts and the customs of tillage\r\nand pasturage forming manifestly only two aspects of one and the\r\nsame organisation. It is fortunate that the court-rolls for the last\r\ntwo hundred years have been preserved, and that they are in the safe\r\ncustody of the present lord of the manor.\r\n\r\nOn the south-west the lands of Stratton and Grimstone are bounded by\r\na stream, the River Frome, flowing towards Dorchester, from which\r\nStratton Mill has the right of taking a defined amount of water.\r\nBetween the stream and the villages are the commonable meadows; on\r\nthe north-east of the villages the arable fields, tapering somewhat,\r\nstretch up the hill slope to Stratton and Grimstone Downs. The whole\r\narrangement is shown very clearly in the tithe commutation map, dated\r\n1839. The two manor farms were separate and enclosed, and lay side by\r\nside along the boundary between the two manors, in each case comprising\r\nabout one-third of the cultivated land. The remaining arable land in\r\neach manor formed, so far as fences were concerned, one open field,\r\ndivided into three oblong strips, known respectively in Stratton as\r\nthe East, Middle, and West Field; in Grimstone as Brewer’s Ash Field,\r\nRick Field, and Langford Field. The rotation of crops was: (1), wheat;\r\n(2), barley; (3), fallow. The lower part of the fallow field was sown\r\nwith clover, and was known as the “hatching ground”--a term we find\r\nelsewhere in the forms “hitch-land” and “hook-land”--the upper part\r\nwas a bare fallow. More recently an improved method of cultivation was\r\nadopted. The barley crop every third year was maintained, but after it\r\nwas carried Italian rye grass was sown in the upper part of the barley\r\nfield (instead of a bare fallow). This was fed off with sheep in the\r\nspring, and then put into turnips; the following year barley was sown\r\nagain. The lower part, however, continued to be sown with clover in the\r\nfallow year, this was fed off with sheep, and wheat followed.\r\n\r\nThe arable fields consisted of “lands” or “lawns,”[3] each supposed\r\nto be 40 “yards” (_i.e._ poles) long, and one, two or four “yards”\r\nbroad--hence supposed to be quarter acres, half acres, or acres. Half\r\nacres were the more common; but whatever the area in theory it was\r\nsomewhat less in actual fact.\r\n\r\n [3] Mr. A. N. Palmer notes the terms “loons,” “lawnds” and “lownts” in\r\n N. Wales and Cheshire (“The Town, Fields and Folk of Wrexham,” p. 2).\r\n\r\nThe West Field in Stratton was somewhat smaller than the other two in\r\nconsequence of the extreme portion--that next the down and farthest\r\nfrom the village--being enclosed. These enclosures in shape and\r\narrangement exactly resemble the lands in the open field; they are\r\nabout one acre each. They are called “The Doles.” Further there are a\r\nseries of small square enclosures taken out of the down, called “The\r\nNew Closes.” All the Doles and New Closes were in grass.\r\n\r\nA remarkable fact is that all the “lands” were scrupulously separated\r\nfrom one another by meres or balks of turf, which, however, were not\r\nknown by these names. Among the people they were, and are, known as\r\n“walls,” but in the court-rolls one finds the term “lanchetts,” which\r\none connects with “lynches,” and “land-shares,” which seems to explain\r\nthe term “launchers” which I have found in Devonshire. In the level\r\nparts of the fields the “walls” were mere strips of turf about a foot\r\nwide; but in the sloping parts they formed steep banks, sometimes\r\nseveral feet high, and the successive “lands” formed terraces one above\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nAll the cultivators, except the tenants of the two manor farms, were\r\ncopyholders, holding for a tenancy of three lives, the widow of the\r\nholder having the right to continue the holding during the period of\r\nher widowhood. By the custom of the manor the lessee of the manor had\r\nat any time (even though his lease had but a day to run) the right to\r\ngrant a copyholder two lives, _i.e._, to accept a fine and substitute\r\ntwo new names for those of dead or dying persons on the “copy.”\r\n\r\nThe copyholds, when not “cotes” or simply cottages with common rights,\r\nwere either “half-livings,” “livings,” or, in one or two cases, other\r\nfractions of a living. A half-living consisted of four or five nominal\r\nacres in each of the common fields, and common rights upon the meadow,\r\ncommon fields and common down, in Stratton, for one horse, two cows,\r\nand forty sheep. A whole living consisted of a share about twice as\r\nlarge in the field and meadow, and a common right for two horses,\r\nfour cows, and eighty sheep. But each copyhold, whether a whole or\r\nhalf-living, included one dole and one new close. There were three\r\nwhole livings and twelve half-livings in Stratton, and five “cotes,”\r\n_i.e._, cottages with one or two strips of land in the arable fields\r\nattached to them. In Grimstone there were four whole livings, six\r\nhalf-livings, one three-quarters living, and one whole and a-quarter\r\nliving. In either manor, therefore, if we reckon two half-livings as\r\nequal to one whole, there were nine whole livings in all; those of\r\nStratton being normally held by fifteen copyholders, those of Grimstone\r\nby twelve, though the number might happen in practice to be less. Thus\r\nat the time of the tithe commutation (1838) there was in each manor one\r\ncopyholder who had two half-livings. In all formal documents a “living”\r\nis termed a “place,” and a half-living a “half-place.” The common\r\nrights attached to a living in Grimstone were slightly different from\r\nthose in Stratton. They are further explained below.\r\n\r\nOnce a year, at about Christmas, the tenants of each manor met, the\r\nsteward presiding; the elected officials submitted their accounts,\r\nand resigned their offices, and their successors were re-elected. The\r\nmost important of these were two “viewers of the fields and tellers of\r\nthe cattle,” commonly known simply as the “viewers.” There was also a\r\n“hayward,” and two “chimney peepers” (described in the Court-rolls as\r\n“inspectors of chimnies”). The inspectors of chimneys do not appear in\r\nthe rolls of the eighteenth century; instead are the more important\r\nofficials the “constabul” (_sic_) and “tythingman,” who ceased to be\r\nappointed presumably after the establishment of the county police and\r\nthe commutation of the tithes.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the “chimney peepers” was, as their name implies, to\r\nsee that chimneys were kept properly swept so as not to endanger a\r\nneighbour’s thatched roof. The hayward was in charge of the pound; he\r\nwas entitled to charge 4_d._ a head for all stray beasts impounded if\r\nthey belonged to the manor, and 8_d._ a head for outsiders.\r\n\r\nThe “viewers” had more varied duties. In the first place they had\r\nto appoint one villager as “Lacy’s Bridge man.” “Lacy’s Bridge” is a\r\nstructure of loose stones at a place where the stream, which for the\r\nmost part bounds Stratton meadow, crosses it; and the duty of the\r\nbridge man is to keep it in sufficient repair to enable sheep to cross.\r\nThe viewers used to appoint the cottagers in turn, going down one side\r\nof the road to the end of the village and up the other side.\r\n\r\nNext the viewers provided the manor bull. They bought the bull, they\r\ncharged a fee for his services, and made all necessary regulations. The\r\nbreed favoured varied from year to year, and the viewers were never\r\nknown to please everybody with their choice.\r\n\r\nThen the viewers appointed the common shepherd, in whose charge were\r\nthe sheep of the whole manor almost all through the year. And in\r\ngeneral they had to enforce all the decisions of the court with regard\r\nto the times when sheep or cows should be allowed in the meadow, when\r\nthe sheep should come into the “hatching ground,” how and where horses\r\nshould be tethered, and particularly to see that each tenant sowed his\r\nclover properly. And when the hay in the meadow was ripe, they marked\r\nout to each tenant the plots which fell to his share that year. It\r\nwas usual to re-elect one of the viewers, so that though there was an\r\nannual election, each viewer held office for two years, being for the\r\nfirst year the junior viewer, for the second the senior.\r\n\r\nThere is much that is interesting in the management of the sheep\r\nflock. From April 6th to September 18th the sheep fed by day on the\r\ndown, and were folded by night on the fallow field. The fold began at\r\nthe top of the field, and gradually worked downwards, covering about\r\nhalf-an-acre every night, and so manuring the whole. There being no\r\nother water supply on the downs, all the tenants had to take turns to\r\ncarry up water to fill the water-troughs, and the viewers saw that they\r\ndid so. On September 18th the sheep came into the “hatching ground,”\r\non which, as we have seen, clover had been sown; and it is noticeable\r\nthat this crop, sown individually by each copyholder on his own lands,\r\nwas fed off by the common flock under the supervision of the common\r\nshepherd. In winter the sheep belonging to each tenant had to be folded\r\nseparately; and the doles and new closes were used for wintering the\r\nsheep. Some made it a practice to sell off their flock when feed became\r\nscanty, and to buy again the next spring; but the traditional custom\r\nwas to keep the sheep till they were four or five years old, at which\r\nage they became fat, perhaps by superior cunning; meanwhile, of course,\r\nthey had been yielding wool and manure. In later years, though every\r\nhalf living was entitled to forty sheep, by a common agreement the\r\nnumber was limited to twenty-five in spring, and later in the year to\r\nthirty-five, when the lambs reached the age at which they were counted\r\nas sheep in the calculation of common rights.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most curious feature in the local system of agriculture\r\nwas the management of the common meadow. Sheep were allowed in it\r\nfrom March 1st to April 6th (it would only bear ten or eleven), then\r\nthey had to come out and join the common flock, and the grass was let\r\ngrow to hay. At hay time the viewers went out and by the help of some\r\nalmost imperceptible ridges in the soil, and certain pegs driven into\r\nthe river banks, they marked out to each tenant the plots on which\r\nhe was allowed to cut and gather the hay. There were forty-seven\r\nof these little plots; twenty-seven of them were definite parts of\r\nparticular copyholds, but nineteen were “changeable allotments,” each\r\nof which belonged one year to one holding, the next year to another,\r\naccording to certain rules; while the remaining allotment, a little\r\nthree-cornered plot in the middle called “100 Acres,” amounting perhaps\r\nto five perches in area, was divided among the holders of the adjacent\r\n“Long lands.” On July 6th, the hay having been carried, the cows came\r\nin, and grazed in the meadow till November 23rd, and then the meadow\r\nwas watered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRATTON MEADOW\r\n\r\n  Scale 1:2500]\r\n\r\nI have before me the map of the meadow, now somewhat tattered,\r\nbeing drawn upon a half sheet of thin foolscap, and a little notebook\r\nrecording particulars of the different plots in the meadow, and in the\r\ncase of the changeable allotments, who were entitled to them each year\r\nfrom 1882 to about 1905, which the viewers used in partitioning the\r\nmeadow.

The\r\nbutter nowadays goes rancid immediately, and the cheese has no taste.\r\nOn the other hand, the enterprising young farmer who now holds the\r\nmanor farm at Stratton, who has himself been a “viewer,” says: “They\r\nalways had two crops,” _i.e._, the corn crops had to struggle with\r\ncouch grass, which partly for want of sufficient ploughing, and partly\r\nbecause it had a secure foothold in the “walls,” was never properly got\r\nrid of.\r\n\r\nThat the life of the old system was gradually dying out before\r\nit was ended by the extinction of the copyholds appears from two\r\ncircumstances: the old habit of mutual help in ploughing, one tenant\r\nlending his horse to another, had died out; and the viewers had\r\ndifficulty in getting their expenses refunded. The wonder is that its\r\nvitality was so persistent.\r\n\r\nThe history of the manors can be pretty fully traced by means of\r\nthe Court rolls, from 1649, when a Parliamentary survey was held, to\r\nthe present day. In 1649 Stratton had one copyhold tenant holding a\r\nplace and a-half, four holding one place each, and ten holding half\r\na place each, making 10½ “places” or “livings” altogether. There\r\nwere, besides, 12 copyholders who each held a “customary cottage with\r\nthappurtenances.” During the next two hundred years (from 1649 to 1838)\r\nthe number of “livings” diminished from 10½ to 9; the actual number of\r\nholders of livings or half-livings diminished only from 15 to 14; but\r\nthe twelve “customary cottages with thappurtenances,” which included\r\none or two acres of arable land and corresponding common rights,\r\ndiminished to five “cotes.” The other cottagers, however, retained the\r\nright of cutting as much furze on certain “sleights” on the down, at\r\nany one time, as they could carry home on their head and shoulders; and\r\nthe total number of cottagers was just two less in 1838 than in 1649.\r\n\r\nThe Court rolls contain, besides declarations of rights of the manor\r\nto water from the stream, and to the allegiance of certain residents\r\noutside, and a record of the changes in the tenantry, the names of the\r\nofficers elected, and regulations agreed upon for the management of\r\nthe land. Thus, there is usually some regulation as to the length of\r\nthe rope by which a horse may be tethered in the common fields; mares\r\nare continually being prohibited from being kept in common or common\r\nfield; pigs must not be allowed to stray; cow dung must not be removed\r\nfrom the meadow, nor certain thorny bushes in the meadow be cut, nor\r\nmay ducks or geese be fed in it. The penalty for each of these offences\r\nis a fine of 5_s._ or 10_s._ The neglect to carry water up to the down\r\nfor the sheep is another punishable offence. In 1748 it was found that\r\nthe sheep pond needed to be mended; the viewers accordingly had to see\r\nto its repair, and penalties were agreed upon for refusing to pay the\r\nproper share of the cost.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1765 the dates for, _e.g._, turning cows into the meadow\r\nor sheep into the “hatching ground” varied from year to year; but the\r\nsettlement then arrived at was maintained for a succession of years.\r\nThe jury\r\n\r\n“PRESENT that the Common Meadow be broke with horses on November\r\n22nd,[6] that it be laid up on January 5th and continue unfed till\r\nFebruary 5th, then be broke and fed with sheep.\r\n\r\n“That the Hatching Ground be laid up on January 5th, and not be fed\r\nagain till September 19th.\r\n\r\n“That the Cow leaze must not be fed with sheep in time of sheep\r\nshearing, nor with horses or mares at winnowing time.”\r\n\r\n [6] At this time the Court met in October.\r\n\r\nThe year 1789 was a comparatively important date in the agricultural\r\nhistory of Stratton during the eighteenth century. At the Court held\r\non October 9th, it was agreed that “the tenants shall meet in the West\r\nField on the 14th inst. between 9 and 10 in the morning, to bound out\r\nthe several lands, and afterwards each shall leave a lanchett of a\r\nfurrow between his and the adjoining land under penalty of a fine of\r\n20_s._ And no tenant shall turn his plough on his neighbour’s land\r\nafter the 21st of November.” It would appear that the scrupulous\r\nobservance of the “walls” dividing one man’s land from another, which\r\nwas such an exceptional feature of Stratton and Grimstone Common\r\nFields, dates from this meeting.\r\n\r\nFordington parish, until the extinction of the copyholds, had many\r\nfeatures which compare curiously with those of Stratton and Grimstone.\r\nIt is very much larger; for whereas Stratton and Grimstone together\r\nhave an area of only about 1200 acres, the area of Fordington is\r\n2749 acres, of which, up to 1876, nearly 1800 acres was common field\r\nand common meadow, and 618 acres commons adjoining the common field.\r\nFordington is also peculiarly divided into three portions: the arable\r\nfield and common pastures lying immediately south of Dorchester, the\r\nmeadows forming a detached area by the side of the River Frome, and the\r\nvillage itself a third detached area.\r\n\r\nThe copyholds in Fordington were known, some as “whole-places,”\r\n“half-places,” as in Stratton and Grimstone, but others as “farthing\r\nholds.” One cannot help asking what were the original meanings of these\r\nterms, and how they are related to the “virgates” of Domesday, and to\r\nthe “yardlands” of the Midlands, and the “broad” and “narrow oxgangs”\r\nof Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Concerning these terms it appears to\r\nbe established that a “yardland” or “virgate” was originally one\r\nquarter of a “carucate,” or ploughland, _i.e._, the amount of arable\r\nland (about 120 acres in average soil) which a plough team of eight\r\noxen could plough in a year, together with its due share of meadow\r\nand common pasture. A broad oxgang was about 24 acres of arable land,\r\nand therefore apparently the northern representative of a yardland or\r\nvirgate; and a narrow oxgang was about 12 acres of arable, or half a\r\nbroad oxgang.\r\n\r\nIn Stratton, as we have seen, every “whole place” or “whole living”\r\nhad common rights for two horses, four cows, and eighty sheep; every\r\nhalf-place common rights for one horse, two cows, and forty sheep. The\r\nareas of land attached to the three whole places were respectively 18\r\na. 3 r. 35 p., 19 a. 2 r. 3 p., 22 a. 0 r. 11 p., averaging just 20\r\nacres; the half-places varied from 9 a. 0 r. 19 p. to 13 a. 2 r. 25 p.,\r\nthe smaller half-places having an advantage in quality of soil, and the\r\naverage being almost exactly 11 acres.\r\n\r\nIn Grimstone the common rights as well as the area of land belonging\r\nto particular whole or half-places varied somewhat. The half-places\r\nconsisted respectively of--\r\n\r\n                          Area.        Common Rights.\r\n                       A.  R.  P.   Horses. Cows. Sheep.\r\n  A                    11   0  28      1      2     56\r\n  B                    12   0   7      1      3     48\r\n  C                    16   3   7      1      3     60\r\n  D                    12   3   1      1      2     44\r\n  E (two half-places)  19   2  27      2      5     96\r\n                  (average 12 acres)\r\n\r\nThe Whole Places.\r\n\r\n  A                    21   1  25      2      5    104\r\n  B                    21   1  38      2      5     96\r\n  C                    21   0  19      2      4     96\r\n  D                    20   2  32      2      5     96\r\n\r\nThe “whole and a-quarter place” had 26 a. 0 r. 13 p. of land\r\nand rights for three horses, five cows, and 120 sheep, and the\r\n“three-quarter place” 16 a. 1 r. 2 p., with rights for one horse, five\r\ncows, and eighty sheep. If these be added together and divided by two\r\nwe arrive at two whole places of 21 a. 0 r. 27 p., with the common\r\nrights for two horses, five cows, and 100 sheep. This may be taken\r\nas the typical whole place, and the half-place is just a little more\r\nthan the mathematical half of a whole place. The fact that the common\r\nrights attached to a given unit were more extensive in Grimstone than\r\nin Stratton is the natural consequence of the fact that Grimstone had\r\n244 acres of down and 35 acres of cow-common, Stratton only 190 acres\r\nof down and 26 acres of cow-common.\r\n\r\nBut when we compare these with the whole places, half-places, and\r\nfarthing holds of Fordington, we find rather a puzzling discrepancy. In\r\nthe latter parish the fourteen whole places each had, in 1841, the date\r\nof the Tithe Commutation, rights for four horses, three cows, and 120\r\nsheep, except one, which had no common rights at all, but, apparently\r\nby compensation, had 66 acres of arable land, eleven more than any of\r\nthe others. The smallest of the others had 42 a. 3 r., the largest 55\r\na. 0 r. 22 p., the average being about 48 acres; in other words, in\r\nFordington a whole place had more than twice as much arable land as\r\nin Stratton or Grimstone, and carried a common right for four horses\r\ninstead of for two.\r\n\r\nEach of the twenty-one half-places in Fordington had common rights\r\nfor three horses, two cows, and sixty-six sheep--which more closely\r\napproximates to three-quarters than to a half of the rights of a whole\r\nplace. The area of land attached to a half-place is, however, on the\r\naverage somewhat less than half that attached to a whole place, the\r\nlargest having 25 a. 1 r. 6 p., the smallest 15 a. 1 r. 36 p., the\r\naverage being just under 21 acres. It happens curiously that the\r\nlargest “farthing holds” had more land than the smallest half-places,\r\nas their areas range from 11 a. 1 r. 7 p. to 17 a. 3 r. 35 p. There\r\nwere nineteen of them, and their average area was 14½ acres. Each had a\r\ncommon right for two horses, two cows, and forty sheep.\r\n\r\nThe following tentative hypothesis may be suggested as an explanation.\r\nIt is based on the presumption that the _names_ represent a more\r\nancient set of circumstances than the actual facts recorded in the\r\ntithe apportionment.\r\n\r\nI think it, on the whole, more probable that these units of holdings\r\nare based upon ploughing by horses than upon ploughing by oxen. In\r\nother words, I think that the system of co-aration persisted unimpaired\r\nin these particular villages after horses had superseded oxen for\r\nploughing purposes, which might have happened at a very early date.\r\nThis seems plainly indicated by the fact that during the 190 years from\r\n1649 to 1839 the majority of the copyholders in Stratton and Grimstone\r\nhad only one horse apiece, therefore they must have combined to work\r\neven a two-horse plough; and, as I have said above, the practice of\r\nhelping one another with horses for ploughing only died out in very\r\nrecent years.\r\n\r\nI think further, that in all three manors, a “whole place” or “whole\r\nliving” meant the land cultivated by one plough, but that in Stratton\r\nand Grimstone the plough was a light and shallow one drawn by two\r\nhorses only, and in Fordington a heavier plough drawn by four horses.\r\nThe soil in Stratton and Grimstone is very thin and stony, and would\r\nnot bear deep ploughing; that of Fordington is much deeper and heavier.\r\nFurther, Stratton and Grimstone fields lie on the steep slopes\r\ndescending from the downs; Fordington field is gently undulating.\r\nTherefore, a four-horse plough in Fordington would plough more than\r\ntwice as much land as a two-horse plough in the other villages. A whole\r\nplace then in Fordington naturally would have common rights for four\r\nhorses; in Stratton and Grimstone for two horses only.\r\n\r\nA half-place in Stratton and Grimstone was, therefore, the holding\r\nallotted to the tenant who had one horse, and it carried a common\r\nright for one horse. Though a half-place in Fordington carried in 1841\r\na common right for three horses, I am inclined to believe that it\r\noriginally was the holding of a tenant who had two horses, _i.e._, half\r\na plough team, and originally had a common right for two horses only;\r\nand, similarly, though a farthing hold in 1841 had a common right for\r\ntwo horses, I am inclined to think it originally was the share of the\r\nman who had one horse only, and only carried a common right for one\r\nhorse. That is to say, I think the _names_ here a better guide than the\r\nnineteenth century common rights. If one were to adopt the opposite\r\nview on this point, one would infer that a “half-place” was a misnomer\r\nfor a “three-quarter place,” and was the allotment of the man who had\r\nthree horses, and that a “farthing hold” should properly be called a\r\nhalf-place. But on this assumption it would be hard to explain the fact\r\nthat the arable land attached to a half-place is, on the average, a\r\nlittle less than half that attached to a whole place, and that attached\r\nto a farthing hold only a little more than one quarter.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite probable that when in the course of the gradual\r\nimprovement of horses and ploughs in Fordington, the stage was\r\nreached at which three horses were sufficient for a plough, the\r\nholders of half-places already possessing two horses each endeavoured\r\nto emancipate themselves from the necessity of joint-ploughing, by\r\nobtaining an additional horse; and that when they had generally\r\nsucceeded in this they obtained the right of pasturing three horses\r\neach on the commons and common-field; and when a two-horse plough had\r\ncome into general use, the holders of farthing holds would naturally\r\ntake similar steps, and so acquire common rights for two horses each.\r\n\r\nThere is one other noteworthy fact with regard to Fordington revealed\r\nby the Tithe Apportionment. Certain lands scattered over the fields\r\nof a total area of 4 a. 2 r. 20 p. were the property of the parish\r\nconstable for the time being; the churchwardens similarly held 1 r. 7\r\np., the parish hayward 1 a. 3 r. 18 p., and the parish reeve 3 a. 0 r.\r\n17 p. These ancient village offices were therefore in Fordington not\r\nentirely unremunerated.[7]\r\n\r\n [7] The Boldon Book shows that in the Bishopric of Durham in the\r\n twelfth century, the pounder, carpenter and smith generally occupied\r\n holdings of about 12 acres in virtue of their callings, to remunerate\r\n their services to the manor and to the common ploughs of the manor.\r\n\r\nIn its main features the common-field system of Stratton and\r\nGrimstone appears to be typical of that prevailing before enclosure\r\nin the counties of Dorset, Wilts, Hants, Berks, Oxfordshire, and\r\nGloucestershire.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Select Committee on Commons Enclosure gives a map\r\nof a “rotation meadow,” in which each strip was held in rotation by\r\ndifferent occupiers, in Shilton, Berkshire; and one of a “lot meadow,”\r\nin which the rotation was not by rule, but by lot, in Bestmoor,\r\nOxfordshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nEXTENT OF EXISTING COMMON

common fields existed in 905 parishes\r\nof England and Wales, of a total area of 166,953 acres, and that there\r\nwas reasonable ground for inferring the existence of 97,354 acres of\r\ncommon field land, scattered presumably over some four or five hundred\r\nmore parishes; in other words, that about one parish in every ten in\r\nEngland and Wales presented an example of the medieval system of land\r\nholding and cultivation similar, though as a rule on a smaller scale,\r\nto the survivals described above.\r\n\r\nThe statement is amazing, and would be received with incredulity by\r\nanyone familiar with the rural districts of any county of England, so\r\nfar as it relates to that county. The Commission invites our suspicion\r\nof its statistics. The main purpose of the return was to give the\r\nacreage of surviving commons; these are estimated at 2,368,465 acres.\r\nAs late as 1871, however, the Commission had declared, on the basis\r\nof an estimate made in 1843, that 8,000,000 acres of commons still\r\nexisted, and 1,000,000 acres of common field or meadow. A little\r\nscrutiny of some details confirms one’s suspicions.\r\n\r\nThus, to take a single county, Kent has from the early days of the\r\nenclosure controversy been famous as a well enclosed county. The author\r\nof the “Discourse of the Common weal of this Realm of England” mentions\r\n“those countries that be most inclosed, as essex, kent, devenshire”\r\n(1549). Skipping two and a-half centuries, we find the reporter of the\r\nBoard of Agriculture in 1793 declaring that such a thing as a common\r\nfield did not exist in Kent.[8] We are confirmed in our acceptance of\r\nthis statement by finding that there have been no enclosures in Kent\r\nof common fields by Act of Parliament, either before 1793 or since.\r\nYet the return gives Kent twenty-one parishes having common fields of\r\nan ascertained area of about 4183 acres. It therefore is necessary to\r\ncriticise the methods by which the figures in the return were arrived\r\nat.\r\n\r\n [8] Boys’ “Kent,” 2nd edition, 8vo. (1786), p. 53.\r\n\r\nThey are based on the tithe maps, the Commissioners remarking that “the\r\ncommon field lands are generally distinguishable by the particular\r\nmanner in which they are marked on the Tithe maps, and their area has\r\nbeen estimated from those maps.” The Tithe Commission was appointed in\r\n1836 (6 & 7 Will. IV. c. 71), and the tithe maps and apportionments\r\nwere made mostly before 1850; we are told “the total area embraced\r\nby the Tithe Documents is 28,195,903 acres. The total area of the\r\nremaining parishes is 8,961,270 acres.”\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, for the Commission to have obtained a correct\r\nresult, it was necessary--\r\n\r\n(_a_) that the common field lands should have been _rightly_\r\ndistinguished from other lands;\r\n\r\n(_b_) that their area should have been _rightly_ estimated;\r\n\r\n(_c_) that due allowance should have been made for enclosures between\r\nthe date of the tithe apportionment and the date of the return;\r\n\r\n(_d_) that the area of common field in the parishes for which there are\r\nno tithe maps should have been estimated on correct principles.\r\n\r\nNot one of these conditions was satisfied.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Taking these in reverse order, it is assumed in calculating the\r\narea of common fields in parishes that have no tithe maps, that they\r\nhave the same ratio of common field to other land as those which have\r\ntithe maps. This principle is entirely wrong for two reasons: (1)\r\nbecause Private Enclosure Acts usually arranged for tithe commutation,\r\nso that parishes enclosed by such Acts before 1830 are ordinarily\r\namong those without tithe maps--and equally among those without common\r\nfields; and (2) the existence of unenclosed common fields would be a\r\nreason for demanding a commutation of tithe. The importance of this\r\nmay be shown by taking Bedfordshire as a test case. For sixty-eight\r\nBedfordshire parishes there are no tithe maps, and the Commission\r\nestimates that these sixty-eight parishes have 12,925 acres of common\r\nfields. But sixty-six out of these sixty-eight parishes were enclosed\r\nby Private Acts, leaving two parishes only, of a combined area of 3578\r\nacres, in which a survival of common field might reasonably be deemed\r\npossible, though even in these extremely improbable. Instead of 12,925\r\nacres of common field for this part of the county, the only reasonable\r\nestimate would be 0.\r\n\r\nSimilar statements might be made with regard to any other county which\r\nwas mainly enclosed by Act of Parliament, as Northampton, to which\r\n13,446 acres of common field are attributed to the non-tithe map\r\nparishes; Lincoln, to which 10,823 acres are similarly attributed;\r\nBerkshire, with 2705 acres; Buckingham, with 2365 acres; Cambridge,\r\nwith 2678 acres; Huntingdon, with 2336 acres; Nottingham, with 6617\r\nacres; Oxford, with 4839 acres; Rutland, with 5726 acres, and the East\r\nRiding of Yorkshire, with 7359 acres. For this cause alone by far the\r\ngreater part of the 97,354 acres added on to the total estimated from\r\ntithe maps must be rejected, and of course any error of over-statement\r\nthat we find with regard to parishes which have tithe maps will still\r\nfurther reduce the remainder.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Due allowance has not been made for enclosure between the date\r\nof the tithe apportionment and the date of the return. It is of\r\ncourse very difficult to say how this could have been done without an\r\nelaborate and expensive local enquiry, so far as relates to enclosure\r\nwithout Parliamentary authority. As a matter of fact, no allowance at\r\nall has been made for this sort of enclosure. This is justifiable;\r\nbut at least a general statement should have been made to the effect\r\nthat a very large deduction had to be made on this account in order to\r\nobtain a correct idea of the position. Further, great carelessness was\r\nshown even in allowing for Parliamentary enclosures subsequent to the\r\ntithe apportionment. Thus, to take one glaring instance, 1500 acres of\r\ncommon field are credited to Beddington and Wallington, near Croydon,\r\nin Surrey. These common fields were enclosed by an Act dated 1850, and\r\nthe award, dated 1853, was at the time of the return deposited with the\r\nCopyhold, Inclosure, and Tithe Commission.\r\n\r\n(_a_) and (_b_) But it is in distinguishing the common fields and in\r\nestimating their area from the tithe maps that the worst mistakes have\r\nbeen made. The Commission says that “the common fields are generally\r\ndistinguishable by the particular manner in which they are marked on\r\nthe tithe maps.” From a comparison of a good many tithe maps with the\r\nfigures given in the return, I infer that those to whom the duty of\r\ndistinguishing the common fields was entrusted, were told that areas\r\ndivided into sub-divisions on the maps by means of dotted lines were\r\ncommon fields. These dotted lines indicate a division of ownership\r\nmarked by some slight boundary and not by a hedge. They might indicate\r\nallotments, for example, or a number of other local circumstances,\r\nbesides common fields. The statements that 4183 acres of common field\r\nwere to be found in Kent, and 13,439 acres in Wales, being specially\r\nin direct contradiction of all other evidence that I had collected, I\r\ntested these by two instances. In Kent 1400 acres were assigned to the\r\nparish of Northbourne. By a close examination of the tithe map I could\r\nfind nothing indicating any common field at all; the only excuse for\r\nthe statement was a few dotted lines, which by a reference to the Award\r\nwere proved to indicate only that some fields were inadequately hedged.\r\nFor Wales, I got out the map and award for Llanerlyl, in Montgomery,\r\ncredited with 1675 acres of common field. Here there was something to\r\nbe found on the map looking exactly like common field, but the Award\r\nshowed that these dotted strips of land were “turbaries.”\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the open field parish in its perfection, as Castor\r\nand Ailesworth before enclosure, possessed common arable fields,\r\ncommon meadows, common pasture, and frequently commonable waste, like\r\nAilesworth Heath. Where the parish as a whole becomes enclosed without\r\nan Act of Parliament, particularly if the enclosure is gradual, the\r\nwaste frequently remains common. Thus we have the numerous commons\r\nof Kent, Surrey, and other counties. Less frequently, but still in a\r\nconsiderable number of cases, the common meadows remain open commonable\r\nand unenclosed. Port Meadow at Oxford is a familiar instance. These\r\ncommon meadows are included in the return under consideration among\r\nthe common fields. Thus, for instance, the surprise with which one\r\nreceives the information that Tottenham, in 1873, had 300 acres of\r\ncommon fields, disappears when it is perceived that the marshes along\r\nthe River Lea are meant.\r\n\r\nIt will also be noticed later on that in parishes where the common\r\nfield system has disappeared for generations, there are frequently\r\nstill remaining in the midst of enclosed fields strips of land of\r\ndifferent ownership from the rest of the field, but let to the same\r\nfarmer, and without any visible demarcation. Such fields in Wales and\r\nthe north-west of England are called “quilleted fields.” The tithe\r\nmap records, with its dotted lines, the area and position of the\r\n“quillets.” Such fields are included under “common fields” in this\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nIn at least the great majority of cases where the supposed common\r\nfields are small, it is probable that nothing more notable than\r\nquilleted fields existed at the time the tithe map was made; and even\r\nthis survival would, in most cases, have disappeared since. Out of the\r\n905 alleged cases of common fields, in 670 cases the areas given are\r\nunder 100 acres.\r\n\r\nIn fine, this return of commons and common fields, which gives such\r\na fair promise of numerous surviving common fields, in reality gives\r\nlittle assistance, because there is but the remotest probability in\r\nany particular case that those common fields exist. The probability\r\nis sufficient in some cases to encourage one to make local enquiries,\r\nbut these enquiries nearly always end in disappointment. The following\r\ncases in which common arable fields theoretically survive, are chiefly\r\ninteresting as illustrating the phenomena of the decay of the common\r\nfield system in villages where it has not died a sudden death through\r\nenclosure. I omit the case of Hitchin, made famous by Mr. F. Seebohm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOTHALL (HERTS).\r\n\r\nClothall is a parish lying on the north slope of the chalk hills of\r\nHertfordshire, just off the Great North Road, which passes through\r\nthe adjoining parish of Baldock. Approaching it from the south, one\r\ngradually ascends the long slope from Hertford, and suddenly at the\r\nsummit has before one a far-stretching view over the flat country of\r\nBedfordshire and adjoining counties. The road descends steeply and\r\npasses through the Clothall common fields. At the time of my visit the\r\nharvest (of barley) was being gathered in; the arrangement of the field\r\nwas clearly visible. The long, narrow strips of stubble, never quite\r\nstraight, and never quite of uniform width, were divided by “balks” of\r\ngrass, grown tall and gone to seed. Each balk was reduced to as narrow\r\ndimensions as it could be, without endangering its continued existence,\r\nfor the sake of separating one strip from another. A view of this field\r\nis shown in Mr. Seebohm’s “English Village Community.”\r\n\r\nBut there is in Clothall the husk only, and no surviving kernel of the\r\nEnglish village community. The whole of the field, estimated at about\r\n600 acres, is let to a single farmer, who cultivates it on modern\r\nprinciples, but who is bound to preserve the balks. There are but three\r\nowners of land in the field. Fifty-six acres are glebe, the remainder\r\nbelongs in alternate strips to the lord of the manor (the Marquis of\r\nSalisbury) and to a gentleman to whom possession passed by marriage,\r\nfrom a family which had been engaged in brewing. The land is famous\r\nfor barley, and the owner of a local brewery in the early or middle\r\npart of the nineteenth century gradually bought up nearly all the land\r\nin the common field that did not belong to the lord of the manor.\r\nApplication was made in 1885 to the Board of Agriculture for enclosure,\r\nthe manorial authorities and the vicar both desiring it, but the other\r\nowner objected.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that the villagers still hold to the\r\ntradition that they have rights of common upon the balks, a tradition\r\nwhich is probably well founded. But they dare not attempt to exercise\r\nthose rights. An enclosure here, accompanied by the provision of ground\r\nfor allotments and recreation, would be a boon for the villagers; and\r\nit would probably pay the landowners to get rid of those balks, which\r\nare as great a nuisance agriculturally as they are interesting from an\r\nantiquarian point of view.\r\n\r\nThe counties of Hertford and Bedford have been, in recent years,\r\nparticularly rich in survivals of common field, for the enclosure of\r\nTotternhoe (p. 63) was only completed in 1891; Yelden had a common\r\nfield of about 600 acres up till about the year 1881, when the chief\r\nproprietor, by buying out or compensating all the other proprietors or\r\nowners of common rights, obtained exclusive ownership of the unenclosed\r\nland; and at Studham and Renhold similar voluntary enclosures were\r\ncarried out under the pressure of the chief landowners within the\r\nmemory of old inhabitants. Fragments of commonable pasture in three\r\ndifferent parts of Renhold parish, and a common of about 60 acres in\r\nStudham, remain as memorials.\r\n\r\n\r\nBYGRAVE AND WALLINGTON.\r\n\r\nBeneath the long sloping hillside of Clothall lies the little town of\r\nBaldock, adjoining Letchworth and the “Garden City”; and on the other\r\nside of Baldock is the parish of Bygrave; which is, like Clothall,\r\nstill unenclosed, and for the same reason; the Marquis of Salisbury\r\nbeing here again the lord of the manor, and the other Clothall\r\nproprietor the next largest landowner. But in Bygrave the farms, as\r\nwell as the properties, are very much intermixed. Here and there there\r\nare grassy balks between adjacent properties; and in places the growth\r\nof bushes on these has almost made them into hedges, but as a rule\r\nthere is no boundary between strips belonging to different holdings and\r\ndifferent properties. A road through the open fields at one point cuts\r\noff the end of a strip of land belonging to Lord Salisbury from the\r\nrest of that strip; it forms a triangular plot too small to repay the\r\ntrouble of bringing the plough across the road to plough it; and the\r\nmen who hold the adjoining land revere the rights of property too much\r\nto touch it; it therefore remains a refuge for all manner of weeds.\r\n\r\nAs in Clothall, no common rights are exercised over the common fields\r\nof Bygrave by the poor of the parish, nor could I hear of any tradition\r\nof rights belonging to the poor or to cottagers. But the different\r\noccupiers of land in the common fields have, and exercise, the right of\r\nshackage, _i.e._, of grazing cattle after harvest, over one another’s\r\nholdings. And the lord of the manor has a special right of “sheep-walk”\r\nover the whole, for a month, from the first week in May and October.\r\nThis right is let with one of the farms. It is not actually exercised,\r\nbecause the other occupiers of lands in the open field buy exemption.\r\n\r\nThe hamlet of Luffenhall, also near Clothall, has “shack lands” held\r\nunder similar conditions.\r\n\r\nThe next parish to Clothall on the east, Wallington, is also\r\nunenclosed. It has a small common on which cottagers have the right\r\nto keep a cow and a calf, but so far as the rest of the parish is\r\nconcerned, the only surviving feature of the externals of the common\r\nfield system is the wide, breezy stretch of open land, under wheat,\r\nroots and grass; and of the spirit of the “village community” there is\r\nnothing. There are but two farms; the wages paid are only 10_s._ to\r\n12_s._ per week. Such wages, so near London, naturally fail to keep\r\nthe labourers in the village; and the population is now (1903) less\r\nthan 100, though the church has seats for 260. As the men go, more and\r\nmore land is laid down in grass, and machinery is more and more used;\r\nthe absence of hedges of course facilitates the use of certain kinds of\r\nagricultural machinery. The unenclosed parish of Wallington, in fact,\r\nrepresents in an extreme degree the triumph of all those tendencies\r\nagainst which the opponents of enclosure waged war--great farms,\r\nabsolute dependence of the labourer, low wages, rural depopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUTTON (NORTHAMPTONSHIRE).\r\n\r\nThe parish of Castor, or Caister, includes, besides the hamlets of\r\nCastor and Ailesworth, the enclosure of which has been described,\r\nthe townships of Sutton and Upton. Sutton had not at the time of the\r\nenclosure of Castor and Ailesworth been legally enclosed, and the\r\nparish is described from the tithe map as consisting of 450 acres of\r\ncommon field and 150 acres of common, out of a total of 888 acres.\r\nThe vicar, who had bought nearly all the land in the parish, and also\r\nthe manorial rights, in 1899 applied for an Act of Enclosure, which\r\nhe obtained in 1901. There were in Sutton certain lands belonging to\r\nthe township, intermixed with those in private ownership. The rents\r\nof these were paid with the poor rates. Up till 1880 the two farmers\r\nwho between them occupied nearly the whole of the cultivated land,\r\nused to confer every year and agree upon their course of tillage.\r\nThey were then persuaded by the vicar to disentangle their farms, and\r\ncultivate them in the ordinary way. At that time there ceased to be in\r\nSutton any visible sign of any exceptional features in the system of\r\nlandownership. The lands belonging to the township are recorded in the\r\ntithe map, and their measurement in the tithe award, but no balks to\r\nmark them are preserved.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the vicar of Sutton for the following illustration of\r\nthe possible evils of the common field system. It occurred in a parish\r\nwhere he had formerly been resident, which he did not name.\r\n\r\nIn this parish two adjacent strips of land were occupied respectively\r\nby a farmer and a shoemaker. The farmer, who was a careful and diligent\r\ncultivator, having well manured and laboured his strip, sowed it with\r\nwheat, and as harvest approached saw the prospect of an exceptionally\r\ngood crop. The shoemaker left his strip entirely untouched. But when\r\nthe farmer was about to begin to reap, the shoemaker intervened, and\r\nclaimed that the strip which was cultivated was his, and the untilled\r\nstrip belonged to the farmer. The field jury was summoned, and the\r\nextreme positiveness and assurance of the shoemaker carried the\r\nday, and the shoemaker reaped the wheat. The farmer then begged his\r\nsuccessful adversary for some compensation for his lost labour and\r\nexpense, but was told that he might consider himself lucky not to be\r\nprosecuted for trespass. The farmer then proceeded to make the best of\r\nhis bad bargain, and set to work to plough up the weeds and thistles\r\nthat covered the strip of land awarded him. But as he ploughed he\r\ncontinually turned up pieces of leather, corners wasted in cutting\r\nout “uppers,” and other refuse of a shoemaker’s workshop. These he\r\ncollected and brought before the field jury. The previous decision was\r\nthen reversed and the shoemaker was compelled to make restitution to\r\nthe man he had wronged.\r\n\r\n\r\nELMSTONE HARDWICKE (GLOUCESTER).\r\n\r\nElmstone Hardwicke is an extremely interesting example of the common\r\nfield system in a state of natural decay. Very nearly the whole\r\nparish belongs to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but the holdings\r\nare intermixed and in small parcels, over a large part, perhaps 1000\r\nacres, of the parish, the farms having been granted on leases of three\r\nlives. The farmers would be glad to consolidate their holdings and\r\nenclose, but the Ecclesiastical Commissioners effectually discourage\r\nthis, as I was told, by exorbitant demands for increase of rent. On the\r\nother hand, I was informed that the Commissioners themselves desired\r\nto enclose, but did not care for the expense of proceeding by Act of\r\nParliament, and they were endeavouring to obtain their object by\r\nrefusing to “re-life,” in order that the leases might fall in, and be\r\nconverted into leases for short terms that might be made to terminate\r\nsimultaneously. Thus an old farmer who had a lease of 60 acres in\r\n100 different parcels scattered over the common fields, informed me\r\nof the negotiations that had been entered into with him. He was by\r\nno means disposed to readily part with his lease, as he had two good\r\nlives remaining, both being his nephews, one aged 40 and the other 50.\r\n“They’ll both mak’ ’ighty,” he said, that being his own age, though he\r\nlooked a score of years younger.\r\n\r\nThis one farmer still (in 1899) followed what had been the customary\r\ncourse of cultivation for the parish--a four years course of wheat,\r\nbeans, wheat, fallow; this being a modification of a still earlier\r\ncourse of wheat, beans, barley, fallow, the soil being more suitable\r\nto wheat than to barley. The other farmers followed no fixed rule,\r\neach one cultivating his farm as he chose, subject, however, to the\r\nright that was still recognised and exercised, that each occupier could\r\nturn horses, cattle and sheep on to the common fields after harvest\r\nuntil the first of November. In consequence of the abandonment of the\r\ntraditional course of cultivation the common use of the fallow-field\r\nhas been dropped by general consent, for the last forty or fifty years.\r\nThe institution of the field jury has also disappeared; though the\r\nabove-mentioned old farmer still posts the notices declaring the fields\r\nopen or closed, and so may be said to fill the post of “foreman of the\r\nfields,” he does so by right of inheritance rather than of election, in\r\nsuccession to his father.\r\n\r\nVarious controversies have arisen recently in Elmstone Hardwicke with\r\nregard to the rights of various persons interested. I have referred\r\nabove to the case of the farmer who, in the spring of 1899, occupying\r\na “headland” in the common fields on which various strips belonging to\r\nhis neighbours abutted, instead of following the customary practice\r\nand waiting to plough till the last, ploughed his headland before\r\nthe abutting lands were ploughed, and then sued for damages when his\r\nneighbours turned their ploughs on his land.\r\n\r\nAnother farmer who occupied a very small holding in Elmstone\r\nHardwicke, and a much larger holding in an adjoining parish, made a\r\npractice of turning great numbers of sheep on the Elmstone Hardwicke\r\ncommon fields in the open time, which he was able to keep in the\r\nclose time on his other land. The question arose whether this unfair\r\nprocedure was lawful. The coming into force of the Parish Councils Act\r\nof 1894 also had the effect of suggesting enquiries into the claims of\r\nlabourers to share in common-right privileges.\r\n\r\nThe vicar, the Rev. George Bayfield Roberts, accordingly obtained the\r\nopinion of Sir Walter Phillimore on the subject. It was as follows:--\r\n\r\n“As far as I can gather from the facts laid before me, I think that\r\nevery freeholder and copyholder has a right to turn cattle upon every\r\npart of the common field, and that the right is not confined to the\r\nparticular field or part of the common field in which he holds land.\r\n\r\n“This right passes to the tenant or occupier under each freeholder or\r\ncopyholder. The tenant, or occupier, has it, not in his own right but\r\nmerely as claiming under his landlord.\r\n\r\n“I know of no rule of law which would give this right to farmers as\r\nsuch, and deny it to cottagers as such, if the latter have holdings on\r\nwhich they can keep their beasts during close time. But the right to\r\nturn on to Lammas lands (as this common field is) can only be exercised\r\nin respect of beasts used in the cultivation or manuring of the holding\r\nin respect of which the claim is made (_Baylis_ v. _Tyssen-Amhurst_,\r\nLaw Reports 6 Ch. D. p. 500).\r\n\r\n“As the cottagers are said to be tenants of the farmers, the latter\r\ncan make it clear in all future lettings that they do not let with the\r\ncottages the right to pasture in the common field.\r\n\r\n“(2) The tenant of the Barn farm should keep his land unenclosed during\r\nopen time, and anyone who has a right to turn on cattle can sue him\r\nif he obstructs (_Stoneham_ v. _London and Brighton Railway Co._,\r\nLaw Reports 7 Q. B. p. 1), or can pull down the fencing (_Arlett_ v.\r\n_Ellis_, 7 B. & C. p. 346).\r\n\r\n“(2a). I do not think it would be wise to pull down a whole fence,\r\nor sue for the damage caused by the fence, if substantial and easy\r\nopenings were made during open time. But there is some authority for\r\nsaying that the whole fence must be removed (_Arlett_ v. _Ellis_, cited\r\nabove).\r\n\r\n“(3) The only _locus standi_ for the Parish Meeting is, if it has been\r\ngiven by the County Council all the powers of a Parish Council under\r\nsection 19, sub-section 10, of the Local Government Act, 1894 (56 & 57\r\nVict. c. 73), to apply to the Board of Agriculture under section 9 of\r\nthe Commons Act, 1876 (39 & 40 Vict. c. 56).\r\n\r\n“This power is given to Parish Councils by section 8, sub-section c, of\r\nthe Local Government Act, 1894.\r\n\r\n“Section 9 of the Commons Act, 1876, enables the Inclosure\r\nCommissioners (whose place is now taken by the Board of Agriculture)\r\nto give information and direction ‘upon application’ in order to bring\r\nabout ‘the regulation of Commons’; and for this purpose Lammas lands\r\nare included as Commons, as they also came under the Inclosure Acts.\r\n\r\n“By section 3 a Provisional Order made by the Board for ‘regulation’\r\nmay provide for the ‘adjustment of rights,’ and section 4 shows how\r\nmuch can be done upon such an adjustment.”\r\n\r\nThis opinion was given in March, 1897. The very significant passage\r\nwhich pointed out that since the cottagers held their cottages from the\r\nfarmers, they could not effectively claim any rights which the farmers\r\ndid not choose to grant them, threw cold water on the agitation.\r\n\r\nElmstone Hardwicke is apparently another case in which something would\r\nbe gained and nothing lost by an Act of Enclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\nEWELME (OXFORDSHIRE).\r\n\r\nRather more than half this parish, near Wallingford, is legally in the\r\ncondition of open common fields, and there is besides a very extensive\r\n“cow-common” on which is a golf course. The neighbouring parishes of\r\nBensington[9] and Berwick Salome had until 1852 common fields which\r\nwere in part intermixed with those of Ewelme, and there were commons\r\ncommonable to all three parishes. In 1852 an Act was passed which was\r\ncarried into effect in 1863 for the enclosure of Bensington and Berwick\r\nSalome, and the parts of Ewelme which were intermixed with these.\r\nEwelme is owned by a number of small proprietors who chiefly farm their\r\nown land. These made a voluntary division,[10] but they still enjoy\r\ncertain rights of common and of shooting over one another’s land. No\r\nlabourers enjoy rights of common.\r\n\r\n [9] The Vicar of Bensington has the custody of a remarkable eighteenth\r\n century map of the three intermixed parishes.\r\n\r\n [10] Exchanges of land in common fields so as to enable proprietors to\r\n consolidate their properties are authorised by 4 & 5 Will. IV. c. 30.\r\n\r\nThere are two significant facts about this parish.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, one particular farm enjoys a special right of\r\npasturing sheep on the cow-common, not shared by other farms. This\r\nis significant when taken into consideration with the facts for\r\nCambridgeshire and elsewhere related below.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this gives a typical instance of the effect of enclosure of\r\n_commonable waste_ on the poor. One of the commons enclosed was known\r\nas the “Furze Common,” and it supplied the poor of the neighbourhood\r\nwith their fuel, for _every_ inhabitant had the right of cutting furze\r\non it. After enclosure the Furze Common was allotted to one man, who\r\nallowed no trespass on it, and the _owners_ of cottages were awarded\r\nallotments of land in consideration of rights which the _cottagers_\r\nhad exercised. The lands so allotted became part of ordinary farms,\r\nand the poor simply lost their supply of fuel without any compensation\r\nwhatever. This was done under the sanction, not of an Enclosure\r\nAct rushed through Parliament before 1845, but of the Enclosure\r\nCommissioners, appointed expressly to prevent any injury to the class\r\nleast able to guard its own interests, as well as to facilitate\r\nenclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLE OF AXHOLME.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo catch the spirit of the common field system, to see that system no\r\nmere historical survival, but developing in harmony with modern needs,\r\none must go to the Isle of Axholme. Starting from Doncaster eastwards,\r\nthrough somewhat devious roads, one descends gradually to a wide belt\r\nof reclaimed fen. Between this fen on the west, and the river Trent\r\nwith more fen on the east, is a ridge of low hills, comprising the four\r\nlarge parishes of Haxey, Epworth, Belton and Owston. These constitute\r\nthe Isle of Axholme--an island, indeed, up to the time of the great\r\ndrainage operations of Vermuyden in the reign of James I. It was, no\r\ndoubt, a very ancient home of fishermen and fowlers, who gradually\r\nbrought the island itself into cultivation, using the plough as a\r\nsubsidiary means of subsistence. The strenuous opposition offered by\r\nthe people of Axholme to the work of the Dutch engineer is well known.\r\nEven after they were beaten, and the greatest drainage scheme of the\r\nseventeenth century was carried through, the four Axholme parishes\r\nretained extensive fens, used as common pastures.\r\n\r\nWhen in the eighteenth century the great trade of driving Scotch\r\ncattle to the London market, in which Sir Walter Scott’s grandfather\r\nwas a pioneer, sprang up, the route followed diverged from the great\r\nnorth road in Yorkshire, in order to avoid turnpikes, and the cattle,\r\ngrazing as they slowly plodded southwards, and fattening on the\r\nroadsides, came through Selby, Snaith and the Isle of Axholme. To\r\nprotect their fields the islanders hedged them along the roadsides,\r\nleaving only narrow thoroughfares; then, to make these thoroughfares\r\npassable for themselves, they laid down for footpath a stone pavement\r\nwhich still exists for twenty miles. But the old hedges have in many\r\nplaces disappeared, so that the fields lie open to the road; and in\r\nparticular, the gates which then guarded every entrance to the fields\r\nare now generally represented by gaps.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteenth century by far the greater part of\r\nthe island proper was in the condition of open arable fields, with\r\nproperties and holdings intermixed, as in the open fields of Laxton;\r\nthough near each village there were enclosed gardens, and closes of\r\npasture. It would appear that the original system of cultivation was\r\na four-year course of husbandry, so that one-fourth of the arable\r\nland was at any time fallow, and used as common pasture, and common\r\nrights were exercised on two of the other three-fourths after harvest;\r\none-fourth probably being under turnips. On the margin of the hill\r\nthere were perhaps commonable meadows, though I cannot trace them.\r\nBeyond, the common fens and marshes, used mainly for grazing horned\r\ncattle, extended over an area of about 14,000 acres.\r\n\r\nArthur Young visited the island at this time, and thus describes it:\r\n\r\n“In respect of property, I know nothing more singular respecting it\r\n(the County of Lincoln), than its great division in the Isle of Axholm.\r\nIn most of the towns there, for it is not quite general, there is much\r\nresemblance of some rich parts of France and Flanders. The inhabitants\r\nare collected in villages and hamlets; and almost every house you see,\r\nexcept very poor cottages on the borders of commons, is inhabited by\r\na farmer, the proprietor of his farm, of from four or five, and even\r\nfewer, to 20, 40, and more acres, scattered about the open fields, and\r\ncultivated with all that minutiae of care and anxiety, by the hands of\r\nthe family, which are found abroad, in the countries mentioned. They\r\nare very poor respecting money, but very happy respecting their mode of\r\nexistence. Contrivance, mutual assistance, by barter and hire, enable\r\nthem to manage these little farms, though they break all rules of rural\r\nproportion. A man will keep a pair of horses that has but 3 or 4 acres\r\nby means of vast commons and working for hire.\r\n\r\n“The enclosure of these commons will lessen their numbers and vastly\r\nincrease the quantity of products at market. Their cultivated land\r\nbeing of uncommon fertility, a farm of 20 acres supports a family very\r\nwell, as they have, generally speaking, no fallows, but an endless\r\nsuccession of corn, potatoes, flax, beans, etc. They do nearly all\r\ntheir work themselves, and are passionately fond of buying a bit of\r\nland. Though I have said they are happy, yet I should note that it was\r\nremarked to me, that the little proprietors work like Negroes, and do\r\nnot live so well as the inhabitants of the poor-house; but all is made\r\namends for by possessing land.”[11]\r\n\r\n [11] “Agricultural Survey of Lincolnshire,” p. 17.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 the chief landowners took steps to obtain an Act for enclosing\r\nall four parishes. There were stronger reasons for enclosing than\r\nin the majority of the East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire parishes all\r\naround, in which Parliamentary enclosure was being pushed furiously\r\non, for the fens were capable of enormous improvement. But in the Isle\r\nof Axholme it was not possible for the chief landowners to overbear\r\nthe opposition of the villagers. One peculiar feature of the locality\r\nwas that every cottage had a common right, and there were no rights\r\nattached to land apart from cottages. This fact, and the peculiarly\r\nwide distribution of property, caused the decision to rest with the\r\npeasantry. They raised no objection to the division and drainage of the\r\nmarshes, perceiving that their allotments would be far more valuable\r\nafter drainage than their common rights before; so this part of the\r\nscheme was generally agreed to. But on the question of the enclosure of\r\nthe arable fields they were not complacent. They saw that the expense\r\nof hedging a small allotment would be heavy, and the injury done by\r\nthe hedge to a small plot, of say 1 or 2 acres, by shading the land\r\nand sheltering it from the wind would more than counterbalance the\r\nadvantage of having that holding in one piece instead of in two or\r\nthree, to say nothing of the loss of the space given up to hedges. They\r\nalso probably feared that the arable land, if enclosed, would largely\r\nbe laid down to grass, and so the benefit of an increased demand for\r\nlabour and higher wages promised by the enclosure of the marshes\r\nwould be lost, at least in some degree, through the enclosure of the\r\nfields. Accordingly the necessary consent of a “three-fourths majority\r\nin number and value” of the owners was not obtained, and the proposal\r\nto enclose was defeated. It would appear that all the educated,\r\nintelligent, and influential people did their best to overcome this\r\n“ignorant prejudice.” But on the other hand there were the votes of\r\nall those cottagers who did not as yet possess strips in the common\r\nfields, but who hoped to be able to purchase them. They saw that while\r\nthousands of acres of land lay immediately round the villages in acre,\r\nhalf-acre, and rood strips, there was a chance of buying one, and so\r\ntaking the first upward step from the rank of the landless labourer. On\r\nenclosure those strips would give place to closes of at least several\r\nacres each, and the closes would be quite out of their reach. Blind,\r\nobstinate, wilful, and prejudiced as the villagers seemed to their\r\nbetters, the event shows that they were entirely accurate in their view\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\nArthur Young’s account of these proceedings is as follows: “In the Isle\r\nof Axholm there is an immense inclosure on the point of beginning,\r\nthe Act and survey having been passed of no less than 12,000 acres of\r\ncommons in the four parishes of Haxey, Hepworth, Belton, and Owston. I\r\npassed these commons in various quarters, and rode purposely to view\r\nsome parts; they are in a wretched and unprofitable state, but valued,\r\nif inclosed, in the ideas of the islanders at 10_s._ or 11_s._ an acre.\r\n\r\n  In Haxey there are 305 claims on account of 3810 acres.\r\n  ″  Hepworth     ″  236      ″        ″      2285 acres.\r\n  ″  Belton       ″  251      ″        ″      3664 acres.\r\n  ″  Owston       ″  229      ″        ″      4446 acres.\r\n\r\n“_Cottage rights are claims, but lands without a cottage have none._\r\nIt was a barbarous omission that when the Act was procured they\r\nresisted a clause to divide the open arable fields subject to rights\r\nof common. But they have here, by a custom, a right of inclosure which\r\nis singular; every man that pleases may enclose his own open field\r\nland notwithstanding the rights of common upon it while open; and\r\naccordingly many do it when, by purchase, they get five or six acres\r\ntogether, of which I saw many examples.” (“Agricultural Survey of\r\nLincolnshire,” p. 79.)\r\n\r\nSomewhat later a second attempt was made in the parish of Owston to\r\nobtain an enclosure with partial success. Three of the four fields\r\nwere divided and enclosed: but the same motives which prevented the\r\nenclosure of the four parishes at the previous attempt were strong\r\nenough to secure that one field should remain open. It was in 1811, I\r\nwas locally informed, that the Owston Enclosure took place. I can find\r\nno record of the Act.\r\n\r\nAs we saw above, the old system (probably a four-field course) of\r\ncultivation had dropped into disuse even before the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, but still, up to about the year 1850, the custom\r\nremained that on one of the four fields, that under wheat, after the\r\ncrops had been carried, the “Pindar” gave notice that “the fields\r\nare to be broken,” and over that field common rights of pasture were\r\nexercised for about a month, from some day in October to Martinmas\r\n(November 23rd). Then the Pindar kept watch over the grazing animals\r\nnight and day, and by night built up enormous bonfires, with all the\r\nboys of the village clustering round and roasting potatoes.\r\n\r\nBut about 1850 even this custom disappeared, and now every holder of\r\nlands in the open fields cultivates them as he chooses, but they must\r\nbe under some form of tillage as long as they remain open. But the\r\ntendency, observed by Arthur Young, for the larger owners of lands in\r\nthe common fields to buy, sell and exchange strips with other owners\r\nwith the object of getting some half-dozen acres in one continuous\r\npiece and then enclosing them, has continued up to the present day.\r\nSuch enclosures are laid down in grass, and in this way the area of the\r\nopen fields has gradually been reduced.\r\n\r\nThe strips of land in the open fields are known as “selions,” the\r\nauctioneers’ notices of a sale reading, “All that selion piece of\r\nland,” etc. They are also known as “acres,” “half-acres,” “roods,”\r\netc., but these terms must not be taken as exactly defining their area.\r\nA nominal acre varies in area from a minimum of about half an acre to a\r\nmaximum of an acre and a half. As the half-acres and roods similarly\r\nvary, it follows that the largest “half-acres” are bigger than the\r\nsmallest “acres.”\r\n\r\nThe general aspect of the fields is well shown in the photograph taken\r\nfor me by Mr. Newbit, of Epworth. I asked in a bar-parlour in Haxey,\r\n“Are these allotments both sides of the road?” A labourer answered,\r\n“Yes, but there are seven miles of these allotments.” But the publican\r\ncorrected him. “Well, it’s not allotments exactly, it’s _a very old\r\nsystem_, that’s what it is.” Further conversation with one man and\r\nanother gave me a strong impression that the people of Axholme are\r\nproud of their “very old system.” That they have some reason to be\r\nproud of it Mr. Rider Haggard bears witness:\r\n\r\n“The Isle of Axholme is one of the few places I have visited in England\r\nwhich may be called, at any rate in my opinion, truly prosperous in an\r\nagricultural sense, the low price of produce notwithstanding, chiefly\r\nbecause of its assiduous cultivation of the potato.”[12]\r\n\r\n [12] “Rural England,” Vol. II., p. 186.\r\n\r\nAxholme may be described as a district of allotments, cultivated, and\r\nin great part owned, by a working peasantry. The “assiduous cultivation\r\nof the potato” is rather an indication of the real strength of Axholme\r\nagriculture, than a true explanation of it. At the time of Arthur\r\nYoung’s visit, the isle was noted for the cultivation of flax and hemp;\r\nand this continued to be a feature of the local agriculture till about\r\nthirty or forty years ago, when the “assiduous cultivation of the\r\npotato” succeeded it. Now, as Mr. Rider Haggard notices, experiments\r\nare carried on with celery. The small holders, I was assured on all\r\nsides, cultivate the land much more thoroughly than large farmers do\r\ntheir farms, and the very look of the crops confirmed this eloquently,\r\neven to my unskilled observation. Mr. Rider Haggard quotes a local\r\nexpert, Mr. William Standring, as saying, “Wheat crops in the isle\r\n_averaged seven quarters_ (56 bushels) an acre, the oats nine or ten\r\nquarters, the clover hay, which grew luxuriantly, two or three tons an\r\nacre, and the roots were splendid.” He continues, “That Mr. William\r\nStandring did not exaggerate the capacities of the isle, I can testify,\r\nas the crops I saw there were wonderfully fine throughout, particularly\r\nthe potatoes, which are perhaps its mainstay.”[13]\r\n\r\n [13] “Rural England,” Vol. II., p. 194.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the agricultural success of Axholme is clearly _la\r\ncarrière ouverte aux talens_, which is secured to agricultural\r\nlabourers by the open fields. The spirited and successful cultivation\r\nof varying crops follows naturally.\r\n\r\nHow the upward ladder is used, was well explained by a Mr. John\r\nStandring, himself a holder of ten acres, before the Select Committee\r\nof the House of Commons on Small Holdings in 1889.\r\n\r\nIt is first to be noticed, however, that the general level of wage is\r\nexceptionally high for a purely agricultural district at a considerable\r\ndistance from any considerable town. The customary wage, I was informed\r\nin 1903, was 3_s._ per day. Mr. Rider Haggard, in 1901, found it “2_s._\r\n9_d._ a day for day men, 18_s._ a week for horsemen, and 16_s._ a week,\r\nwith cottage, for garth-men. Men living in the house with foremen and\r\nowners receive about £24 per annum and food, and horsemen £30 per annum\r\nand food.”\r\n\r\nBut when the labourer who has been living in marries and takes a\r\ncottage, he also takes up a holding in the fields. He begins with one\r\n“land,” then takes a second, a third, and so on. The following table,\r\nshowing the way in which land is held in the parish of Epworth, was\r\nsubmitted to the Select Committee[14] by Mr. J. Standring:--\r\n\r\n  Of holdings over 200 acres there are 2 occupiers.\r\n      ″        ″   100   ″   and under 200, there are 12 occupiers.\r\n      ″        ″    50   ″        ″    100      ″     14    ″\r\n      ″        ″    20   ″        ″     50      ″     31    ″\r\n      ″        ″    10   ″        ″     20      ″     40    ″\r\n      ″        ″     2   ″        ″     10      ″    115    ″\r\n      ″        ″     ½   ″        ″      2      ″     80    ″\r\n\r\n [14] Report, p. 189.\r\n\r\nThe eighty holders occupying from half an acre to two acres would all\r\nbe men in regular employment, as a rule, agricultural labourers. A\r\nbody of these sent their deposition to the Select Committee in the\r\nfollowing form:--\r\n\r\n“We, the undersigned, being agricultural labourers at Epworth, are\r\nin occupation of allotments or small holdings, varying from 2 roods\r\nto 3 acres, willingly testify to the great benefit we find from our\r\nholdings. Where we have sufficient quantity of land to grow 2 roods\r\neach of wheat, barley and potatoes, we have bread, bacon, and potatoes\r\nfor a great part of the year, enabling us to face a long winter without\r\nthe dread of hunger or pauperism staring us in the face.”\r\n\r\nBut the more enterprising of these labourers do not rest content with\r\nso small a holding, and these pass into the next class, those who hold\r\nup to 10 acres. “Many such,” says Mr. J. Standring, “keep a horse and\r\na cow and a few pigs. And on some of the stronger land two or three of\r\nthese will yoke their horses together and work their own land, and also\r\nland belonging to other men similarly situated who do not keep horses.\r\nAs a rule they have done very well--I scarcely know a failure.” The\r\npayment for horse-hire is usually made in labour.\r\n\r\nThe most successful of these again recruit the ranks of the larger\r\nfarmers. “I do not believe there is one in ten in my parish, and in the\r\nadjoining parish, among those who are renting from 50 to 100 acres, but\r\nwhat, in my time, has been an agricultural labourer or an agricultural\r\nservant before he was married; and each of them, to my own knowledge,\r\nhas commenced with two or three acres, and in some cases not more than\r\none acre ... one man who is now occupying 200 acres was a labourer in\r\nhis early days.”\r\n\r\nThese bigger farmers sometimes move elsewhere, and take larger farms,\r\nor bring up their sons in other occupations than farming, so that the\r\nfarm of 150 to 200 acres becomes again available for division into\r\nsmall holdings. Thus, in spite of the continual growth of the holding\r\noccupied by individual men at different stages in their career, the\r\naverage size of holdings does not show any tendency to increase. This\r\nis well shown by the figures given for Epworth, respectively, by Arthur\r\nYoung and Mr. J. Standring, at about an interval of a hundred years.\r\nThere were only 236 claimants of allotments in the Epworth commons at\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century; in 1889 there were 291 occupiers of\r\nthe 5741 acres in the parish, occupying therefore, on an average, less\r\nthan 20 acres each.\r\n\r\nThe same eagerness to own land which Arthur Young noticed has also\r\ncontinued to prevail. Land is bought on the building society principle,\r\nmoney for the purpose being borrowed usually at 5 per cent. per annum,\r\nvery frequently through the lawyer who conducts the sale. In the days\r\nof agricultural prosperity land in the open fields of Haxey, Epworth,\r\nand Belton was sold at £130 per acre; land in the one remaining open\r\nfield of Owston as high as £140 per acre. Even now, in spite of the\r\ntremendous fall in price of agricultural produce, the ordinary price is\r\nabout £70 to £75 per acre; which is about twenty-five years’ purchase\r\nof the rent.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that a man who borrows money at 5 per cent. to buy land\r\nwhich can only be let at 4 per cent. on the purchase price embarks\r\non a speculation which from the purely commercial point of view, can\r\nonly be profitable provided the land is appreciating in value. There\r\nwere naturally cases of men who, at the time when prices were falling\r\nmost rapidly, were unable to keep up their payments of interest and\r\ninstalments of principal, and who had in consequence, after a severe\r\nstruggle, to forfeit their partially won property. At this time the\r\nIsle of Axholme won the evil repute of being “the paradise of lawyers.”\r\nBut it would, I believe, be fair to say that the peasantry on the whole\r\nstood the strain of agricultural depression exceptionally well, and\r\nthat their prosperity, with steadier prices, revived exceptionally\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nThe Isle of Axholme has been singularly successful in preserving the\r\nspirit of the common field system--social equality, mutual helpfulness,\r\nand an industrial aim directed rather towards the maximum gross produce\r\nof food than towards the maximum net profit; while at the same time\r\nit has discarded those features of the system which would have been\r\nobstacles to agricultural progress. The “barbarous omission” to enclose\r\nthe open arable fields has been abundantly justified.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOHAM.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Soham, in Cambridgeshire, is another example of a great\r\ndevelopment of small holdings in connection with the persistence of\r\nopen arable fields. This parish, unlike most Cambridgeshire parishes,\r\nhas never been enclosed by Act of Parliament, and the tithe map\r\nindicates the survival of about 1100 acres of common field and 456\r\nacres of common in a total of 12,706 acres. Since the tithe commutation\r\nthe area of common has shrunk to about 236 acres, but from the Ordnance\r\nmap it appears that there is still a very large area of open field\r\nland in four large fields, known as North Field, Clipsatt Field, No\r\nDitch Field, and Down Field; and a smaller one, Bancroft Field. Mr.\r\nCharles Bidwell gave the Special Committee on Small Holdings (1889) the\r\nfollowing account of holdings in this parish:--\r\n\r\n  Under 1 acre              195 holdings.\r\n\r\n  Over  1 and under 5 acres  77    ″\r\n    ″   5     ″    10   ″    34    ″\r\n    ″  10     ″    20   ″    43    ″\r\n    ″  20     ″    50   ″    57    ″\r\n    ″  50     ″   100   ″    32    ″\r\n    ″ 100     ″   200   ″     6    ″\r\n    ″ 200     ″   500   ″     8    ″\r\n    ″ 500     ″    --   ″     5    ″\r\n  (Appendix, p. 501.)\r\n\r\nThus the total area of the parish is held by 457 occupiers, who\r\ntherefore hold, on an average, 28 acres each. In this case it is\r\nstated that the occupiers of the smallest holdings derive considerable\r\nbenefit from the common. A German enquirer who visited Soham as an\r\nexample of an unenclosed parish, found it less poverty stricken than\r\nthe other parishes in the neighbourhood, on account, he was told, of\r\nthe existence of the common pastures. (W. Hasbach, Die englischen\r\nLandarbeiter, 1894.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTON ZOYLAND.\r\n\r\nThe idea occurs to one, whether it would not have been possible to\r\nsecure by an Act of Enclosure for a common field, the abolition of\r\ncommon rights which hindered each farmer or peasant from cultivating\r\nhis holding to the best of his ability, and the laying together of the\r\nscattered strips which formed each holding, without ruining the small\r\nproprietors and small farmers, or encouraging the laying down of tilled\r\nland under pasture.\r\n\r\nWe find _one_ example of such an attempt. The parish of Weston Zoyland,\r\nin Somerset, in 1797 enclosed 644 acres of commonable pasture, and at\r\nthat time and in that neighbourhood the enclosure of Sedgemoor was\r\nbeing rapidly pushed on, as rapidly, in fact, as the local farmers\r\ncould be induced to take up the land. Perhaps in consequence of this\r\nquenching of the land hunger of the farmers with capital, when in\r\n1830 it was resolved to deal with the common fields, the Act took the\r\nform of one for _dividing and allotting_, but not enclosing, Weston\r\nField. The consequence is that this great field of 500 acres still\r\nremains open and unenclosed; the land is specially fertile, there are\r\nan exceptionally large number of small properties in it, and it is all\r\nkept under tillage. I am informed that one of the first acts of the\r\nWeston Zoyland Parish Council, when, on coming into existence, it took\r\nover the custody of the parish maps and documents, was to re-define\r\nthe roads that passed through the field, in accordance with the\r\nCommissioners’ map and award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSOME RECENT ENCLOSURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPTON ST. LEONARDS (NEAR GLOUCESTER).\r\n\r\nThis enclosure took place at the same time as that of Castor and\r\nAilesworth, and was completed in 1899. The common fields consisted of\r\n1120 strips of arable land, total area 520 acres, and the “balks” or\r\n“meres” separating the strips were estimated at 14 acres. There were\r\nmore than eighty owners.\r\n\r\nNo recognised course of husbandry had been followed for about sixty\r\nyears previously. It is believed that before that time a four-year\r\ncourse obtained, but when mangel wurzels were introduced to the\r\nneighbourhood the recurring fallow was discontinued. The right of\r\ncommon after harvest was, however, still maintained. If any cultivator\r\nchose he might grow turnips, but he did so at his own risk, and had to\r\nkeep a boy to guard them from the opening of the fields to the time\r\nthey could be pulled. Old mere stones are found in the meadows of this\r\nparish, and various local traditions remain belonging, apparently, to a\r\nperiod when the village customs resembled those described for Stratton\r\nand Grimstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOTTERNHOE (BEDFORDSHIRE).\r\n\r\nThe Enclosure Act was passed in 1886, and the award is dated 1891.\r\nBefore enclosure Totternhoe was a typical open-field parish; there were\r\nonly 370 acres of old enclosure, to 1797 acres of common field arable,\r\nand 193 acres of common. The situation of Totternhoe is like that of\r\nClothall, on the steep northern slope of the Hertfordshire chalk hills,\r\nwhich here have an almost mountainous appearance. The greater part of\r\nthe parish was in the ownership of the lord of the manor, but there\r\nwere forty owners of land altogether, the others being chiefly yeomen.\r\nThe movement for enclosure came from these yeomen. They took this\r\nstep in order to protect themselves against the tenants of the lord\r\nof the manor, who, whether from ignorance or otherwise, endeavoured\r\nto prevent the exercise of well-known rights of common over land in\r\ntheir occupation. The hill top was saved as an open space, and is a\r\nfavourite picnic resort for the people of Dunstable. Recreation grounds\r\nand land for allotments were also set out, as has been the rule since\r\nthe passing of the Commons Act of 1876. I asked one of the yeomen,\r\nwho had taken a leading part in bringing about the enclosure, whether\r\nit had benefited the parish. He said undoubtedly it had done so, but\r\n“the parish has not recovered from it yet.” Questioned as to how\r\nthis could be, he gave me to understand that the actual increase to\r\nthe cultivators in annual value was not equal to the interest on the\r\ncapital expended on carrying out the enclosure; that the assessment\r\nhad gone up, and the burden of rates and taxes was consequently\r\nincreased. The land allotted to the lord of the manor still, in the\r\nsummer of 1900, was mainly unenclosed, and one could get something of\r\nthe impression of the “champion” country, an impression of great open\r\nfields sweeping up to bare downs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH AND SOUTH LUFFENHAM AND BARROWDEN (RUTLAND).\r\n\r\nThe first steps towards the enclosure of these three parishes were made\r\nimmediately after the passing of the 1876 Act; the Enclosure Act was\r\npassed in 1878, and the awards were made in 1881 and 1882. Out of 5480\r\nacres in the three parishes, 4800 were common-field arable, a heath\r\nclaimed by both Barrowden and South Luffenham occupied 390 acres, and\r\nmuch of the remainder was commonable meadow and pasture. Two systems\r\nof cultivation obtained. Part of the land being heavy clay was on a\r\nthree years’ course of wheat, beans, etc., and fallow, as at Laxton and\r\nEakring; the lighter land was under a six years’ course. The report\r\nof the Enclosure Commissioners says of Barrowden that the 1240 acres\r\nof arable land “is divided in 2790 strips, some not more than 12\r\nfeet wide, each divided from its neighbour by a green balk, which is\r\na nursery of weeds.” Old farmers, however, assured me that the balks\r\nwere mostly gone before enclosure. Field reeves were elected, and they\r\nsettled any dispute that arose in consequence of the absence of balks,\r\nand individual farmers quickly detected, by pacing across their strips,\r\nif a furrow had been appropriated by a neighbour.\r\n\r\nHere, again, I asked whether the enclosure had been a benefit, and\r\nI was told that the labourers had benefited by the allotments and\r\nrecreation grounds; that the lord of the manor of South Luffenham had\r\nbenefited, because he got the disputed moor, but that farmers, as\r\nfarmers, had gained nothing, and as common-right owners they had lost\r\nthrough the enclosure of the moor.\r\n\r\nEnclosure in this case originated in what may be called the normal\r\nway, _i.e._, on the initiative of the lords of the manors. It was the\r\ndoubtful ownership of the Barrowden and Luffenham moor which had until\r\n1876 prevented enclosure; then the respective lords agreed to combine\r\nto obtain an enclosure of all three parishes, and let the Commissioners\r\ndetermine to which parish the moor belonged. It was awarded to\r\nLuffenham, but the Luffenham freeholders lost it just as much as those\r\nof Barrowden; it is now the private property of the lord of the manor.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAM FIELD.\r\n\r\nA curious case of enclosure by Act of Parliament unconnected with the\r\nGeneral Enclosure Acts is that of Ham Field by the “Richmond, Petersham\r\nand Ham Open Spaces Act, 1902” (2 Edward VII., c. ccliii.). It is\r\nentitled, “An Act to confirm agreements for vesting common and other\r\nland in the local authorities of the districts of Richmond and Ham,\r\nand the Surrey County Council as public open spaces, and for other\r\npurposes.” But while it does incidentally confirm these agreements,\r\nthe “other purposes” comprise the main object of the bill, which is\r\nto allow the owners of Ham Common, of whom the Earl of Dysart is the\r\nprincipal, to enclose Ham Common Field, and convert it into building\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe preamble is similarly misleading. The first sentence runs, “Whereas\r\nthe prospect from Richmond Hill over the valley of the Thames is of\r\ngreat natural beauty, and agreements have been entered into with a\r\nview to preventing building on certain lands hereinafter mentioned”--a\r\nsentence admirably framed to disguise the fact that the effect of\r\nthe Act is to extinguish the common rights over Ham Field which had\r\npreviously prevented building, and so to convert the middle distance of\r\nthe famous view from Richmond Hill into an expanse of roofs, perhaps of\r\nvilla-residences, and perhaps----!\r\n\r\nThe agreements recited in the Act represent the consideration for which\r\nthe public authorities mentioned bartered away the beauty of the view.\r\nKingston Corporation gets nine acres for a cricket field; Richmond\r\nCorporation is confirmed in the ownership of Petersham Meadows, which\r\nwas formerly a subject of dispute, and acquires a strip of land\r\nalong the river; and the Surrey County Council acquires 45 acres of\r\nriverside land. The meadows and riverside land in each case are to be\r\nmaintained as open spaces by the authorities. Ham itself merely gets\r\nthe freehold of Ham Common, which means, in effect, that what slight\r\ndanger there might have been of the enclosure of this part of the open\r\nand commonable land of the parish is removed.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Dysart, at the cost of a sacrifice that is probably\r\napparent rather than real, obtains by this Act the right to convert\r\nsome 200 acres of arable common field into a valuable building estate;\r\nthe smaller owners acquire a similar right without any compensating\r\nsacrifice at all; and the only losers by this profitable transaction\r\nare the people of London, who were not consulted in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERROW.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Merrow, adjoining Guildford on the east, is stated in\r\nthe return of 1873 to have had 350 acres of common field. The land\r\nin question covers the lower slopes of the chalk hill, the higher\r\nportion of which is Merrow Down; beneath it is Clandon Park, the seat\r\nof Lord Onslow. Up to about the year 1873 this common field did exist;\r\nthe properties of Lord Onslow, the chief proprietor, were very much\r\nintermixed with those of smaller proprietors; the farm holdings were\r\nsimilarly intermixed with one another, and with a number of strips of\r\nland occupied by labourers and cultivated as allotments. But no common\r\nrights were exercised over these lands, either by the occupiers over\r\none another’s lands, or by the villagers, within living memory; nor,\r\nexcept that the whole of the field was in tillage, was there any common\r\nrule for its cultivation. The existence of a great extent of common\r\nis in itself a sufficient explanation of the disappearance of common\r\nrights over the tilled land.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the present Lord Onslow came into the property, and when a year\r\nor two later he attained his majority, he proceeded to consolidate\r\nhis property in Merrow Field, by buying out the other proprietors, or\r\ngiving them land elsewhere in exchange. The field is still bare of\r\nhedges, and under tillage; but enclosure, in the technical sense, has\r\nbeen completely carried without an Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nSince the enclosure the allotments, which had been numerous, have\r\ngenerally been given up; but the labourers do not attribute this to\r\nthe enclosure, but to the industrial evolution. “There are no farmers\r\nnowadays, only land spoilers. They’ve turned market gardeners, and they\r\nsell _milk_” (with intense scorn). “The land ought to grow beef, and\r\nbarley to make good beer, that’s what Englishmen want,--yes, and wheat\r\nto make bread. But now they all grow garden stuff, what’s the good of\r\nan allotment to a man? If you have anything to sell, you can’t sell it.\r\nIt’s no good growing any more than you can eat.”\r\n\r\nIt may be added that along the river Wey, from Guildford down to\r\nByfleet, there are some very extensive lammas meadows, known by\r\nsuch names as Broad Mead and Hook Mead. The holdings in these are\r\nintermixed, individual pieces sometimes not exceeding an acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEVENTON AND THE BERKSHIRE DOWNS.\r\n\r\nThat part of Berkshire which lies between the valley of the Kennet and\r\nthe Thames would appear, from the return of 1873, to be specially rich\r\nin surviving open fields. The Blue Book assigns to\r\n\r\n  Brightwell                 1000 acres of common field.\r\n  West Hagbourne              550      ″        ″\r\n  East Hendred               2794      ″        ″\r\n  West Hendred               1900      ″        ″\r\n  East Ilsley                1400      ″        ″\r\n  Wallingford St. Leonard     570      ″        ″\r\n  Yattenden                   252      ″        ″\r\n\r\nAs Brightwell was enclosed in 1811, and East Hendred in 1801, the\r\nstatement with regard to these two parishes plainly is incredible; but\r\nin view of the undeniable fact that Steventon, which lies almost in the\r\ncentre of this district, was not enclosed till 1883, there seemed so\r\nmuch possibility of survivals in the other parishes that in July, 1904,\r\nI traversed the whole district in search of such survivals. But the\r\nsearch was entirely unsuccessful; it was plain that Steventon was at\r\nthe time of its enclosure the last remaining example of the old system\r\nin this part.\r\n\r\nHere, as in the Hertfordshire district described above, and in\r\nthe Wiltshire district dealt with in Chapter X., “Enclosure and\r\nDepopulation,” enclosure is one aspect of a change of which the most\r\nvital aspects are the engrossing of farms and the consolidation of\r\nproperties. In each parish this movement proceeds along the line of\r\nleast resistance; in one parish all impediments in the way of the most\r\nprofitable management of estates are swept away by the drastic remedy\r\nof an Enclosure Act; in others they are removed gradually.\r\n\r\nThe latter method I was enabled, by the help of Mr. Bridges, to trace\r\nin detail in the case of Yattenden. The Board of Agriculture return,\r\nas we have seen, assigns 252 acres of common field to Yattenden. The\r\ntithe map, dated 1845, on which this is based, shows in one corner\r\nof “Yattenden Great Field” about 20 acres of intermixed ownership\r\nand occupation, forming part of one “furlong,” remaining in the\r\ncharacteristic common-field arrangement; the rest of the so-called\r\n“Yattenden Great Field” and “Everington Field” were in part divided\r\ninto hedged fields, and in part into compact stretches of about 20\r\nacres each, still unhedged, with here and there single acres detached\r\nin the midst of them; many of these single acres being glebe.\r\n\r\nAn older manorial map, dated 1773, showed that at that date nearly\r\nhalf the parish was open; the eastern part was already divided into\r\ncloses, except for a small stretch of lammas meadow, divided into small\r\nintermixed holdings, by the river Pang; but the western part, Yattenden\r\nand Everington fields, were almost entirely open, and divided in\r\nfurlongs, and the furlongs in acre and half-acre strips. These strips\r\non the map are all marked with the letters of the alphabet, to indicate\r\nwhether they are held by the lord of the manor, by his tenants, or by\r\nother owners.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the process of gradual enclosure, which began before\r\n1773, was continued afterwards, and was nearly complete in 1845. The\r\nend came about the year 1858, when Frilsham Common, in an adjoining\r\nparish, was enclosed. About half of the intermixed strips in Yattenden\r\nGreat Field belonged to a yeoman, who was, his brother told me, “a\r\ngreat man for defining his boundaries.” The enclosure of Frilsham\r\nCommon gave the slight stimulus to the mind of Yattenden necessary to\r\novercome its mental inertia, and make change possible, so the yeoman\r\nin question was able to effect the exchanges he desired, and others\r\nfollowing his example, the lay properties were all separated. But still\r\nthe glebe consists in part of an acre here and an acre there in the\r\nmidst of lands belonging to laymen. These are let with the lands in\r\nwhich they lie; they have no mark to distinguish them, nor boundaries\r\nto limit them; the tithe map and award preserve the record of them, and\r\nthe vicar receives their rent.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance of the glebe lying in part in separate unfenced\r\nstrips scattered over the parish, let with the lands in which they\r\nlie, and so not influencing the agriculture of the parish, though\r\ntestifying to the past system, is by no means uncommon in the parishes\r\nnot enclosed by Act of Parliament.[15]\r\n\r\n [15] Mr. A. N. Palmer, in “Ancient Tenures of Land in the Marches of\r\n North Wales,” gives a list of parishes in one Hundred containing, or\r\n known to have contained, “quilleted fields,” _i.e._ fields containing\r\n strips of land belonging to a different owner from the rest of the\r\n field, these strips being usually glebe.\r\n\r\nIn general the results of the two different methods of enclosure\r\nin this district are practically identical. Superficially the\r\ncharacteristic features of the “champaign” or “champion” country\r\nremain. The population is concentrated in the villages; the sites of\r\nwhich appear to have been originally selected for convenience of water\r\nsupply; outside the villages are the long sweeps of open fields of\r\nbarley, wheat or beans, lying generally open to the roads, and to one\r\nanother, and to the open down, though one notices a tendency to an\r\nincreased use of wire fencing. The monotony is broken by the beautiful\r\ncurves of the hill slopes, and by clumps of trees; here and there, on\r\nsteeper inclines, lynches are clearly visible, and occasionally what\r\nlooks like an inconsequent hedge, beginning and ending in the middle of\r\nthe field--an old “mere” or “balk” on which bushes happened to grow.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the farms run generally from 200 to over 1000 acres\r\neach; machinery is extensively used; the supply of labour, though not\r\nso superabundant as a generation or two ago, is still sufficient, the\r\ncustomary wage being 2_s._ per day. The men themselves struck me as\r\nbeing of finer physique than the agricultural labourers I have seen in\r\nany other part of the South or Midlands of England; but they appear\r\nto be as completely shut out from any rights over the land, from any\r\nenterprise of their own upon the land, or from any opportunities for\r\nrising into the farmers’ class as can well be conceived. Only one\r\nman whom I met could remember a different condition. He, a labourer\r\nof seventy-three, said that in North Moreton before the enclosure\r\n(completed in 1849) every villager who could get a cow could keep it in\r\nthe open fields, and all the villagers also had rights of cutting fuel.\r\nUnder the Enclosure Act some moneys were set aside to provide the poor\r\nwith fuel in compensation for these rights, but latterly the amount\r\nprovided had much diminished.\r\n\r\nSteventon, which lies in the centre of this district, is to some extent\r\nexceptional. The manor has always been in ecclesiastical hands, from\r\nthe first time when the village was founded as a settlement from the\r\nAbbey of Bec in Normandy to the present day, when it is held by the\r\nEcclesiastical Commissioners. In the intervening period it belonged to\r\nWestminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it was in consequence of this that through the greater part\r\nof the nineteenth century, while all the other parishes passed into\r\ntheir present condition of large farms, the farms and properties in\r\nSteventon remained small. Up to about 1874 there were some eighteen\r\nyeomen farmers in the parish, which comprises 2,382 acres, fully\r\nthree-quarters at that time being arable. In addition, the lands\r\nbelonging to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were divided into small\r\nholdings, and all these were intermixed. The system of cultivation was\r\nvery simple. The arable land was divided into two fields, one known\r\nas the “white corn field,” growing wheat or barley, the other as the\r\n“black corn field,” growing pulse or some other crop.\r\n\r\nIn the severe agricultural depression that followed 1874, culminating\r\nin 1879, the yeomen were obliged to borrow in order to continue\r\nfarming, and they mortgaged their lands to certain gentlemen in the\r\nneighbourhood who had money to invest. As one bad season followed\r\nanother, loan had to be added to loan, till the security was exhausted,\r\nand the land passed into the possession of the mortgagee. In this way\r\nthe number of landowners was reduced to five. Then enclosure, which had\r\nbeen proposed and rejected in the forties, was resolved upon. The Act\r\nwas obtained in 1880, and the award was made in 1883.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable disappointment among those who carried out the\r\nenclosure at the results. They were surprised and disgusted at the\r\namount of land reserved for allotments and recreation ground; they\r\nwere also surprised at the expense, which amounted, I was told, to\r\nnearly £10,000. Some were unable to meet the calls upon them, and went\r\nbankrupt. But a large portion of the cost was for road-making, and\r\nwhen this had been paid for, the chief advantage which had been gained\r\nby the whole proceeding, economy in horse labour, was realised. Where\r\npreviously it had taken three horses to get a load of manure to a given\r\nspot in the open fields, along the tracks assigned for that purpose,\r\none horse could draw the same load to the nearest point on the metalled\r\nroadway, and a second horse hitched in front would enable it to reach\r\nits destination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE IN OPEN FIELD PARISHES A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENCLOSURE OF COMMON FIELDS BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n  Map of England and Wales showing land enclosed:\r\n    before the General Enclosure Act of 1801.\r\n    between 1802 and 1845.\r\n    under General Enclosure Act of 1845.\r\n  Scale 1:5,000,000 or 1 inch = 79 Stat. miles.]\r\n\r\nA glance at the accompanying Enclosure Map of England will indicate\r\nthe importance of common fields in the social life of rural England at\r\ncertain dates. It was prepared in the following manner: On the Ordnance\r\nCounty diagrams each parish which had an Enclosure Act by which common\r\nfield arable was enclosed was coloured; if the Act was passed between\r\n1700 and 1801 it was coloured yellow; if passed after the general\r\nEnclosure Act of 1801 and before that of 1845, it was coloured green;\r\nif after 1845, purple. A map of England was drawn summarising the\r\nresults of the county maps. On this _at least_ all purple patches\r\nshowed parishes which possessed open field arable in 1845; _at least_\r\nall the green and purple area combined indicated parishes which had\r\nopen field arable in 1802; _at least_ all the coloured area had open\r\nfield arable in 1700. In the printed map these colours are represented\r\nby three forms of shading. Of the unshaded area one can simply say\r\nthat the Enclosure Acts throw no light upon its agricultural history\r\nso far as the land under tillage is concerned. To a very great extent\r\nit was undoubtedly being enclosed otherwise than by Act of Parliament\r\nsimultaneously with the progress of Parliamentary enclosure, but to a\r\nstill greater extent it either never passed through the common field\r\nsystem or was enclosed before 1700. This statement raises questions\r\nwhich are dealt with below. For the present I have to deal with the\r\ngeneral history of those parishes which did pass through the common\r\nfield system.\r\n\r\nThe original Board of Agriculture, which was an association on similar\r\nlines to those of the Royal Agricultural Society, but enjoying a grant\r\nfrom the Treasury, was founded in 1793, with Arthur Young as secretary\r\nand Sir John Sinclair as president. It immediately took in hand the\r\nwork of making an agricultural survey of Great Britain, county by\r\ncounty. Some counties were surveyed several times, but the original\r\nsurvey of England was completed in the years 1793 and 1794. William\r\nMarshall, the ablest agricultural writer of the time, single-handed\r\naccomplished an agricultural survey of England, ignoring county\r\ndivisions and dividing the country according to natural divisions\r\nmarked by similarity of soil, crops and agricultural methods. The two\r\nsurveys together give us ample information on the different methods of\r\ncultivating open or common fields at the end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the most general system, particularly in the midland\r\ncounties where common fields remained most numerous, was the following\r\nform of the three-field system:--\r\n\r\n“One part” (or one of the three fields) “is annually fallowed, a moiety\r\nof which is folded with sheep and sown with wheat; another moiety is\r\ndunged and sown with barley in the succeeding spring. The part which\r\nproduces wheat is broken up and sown with oats, and the part which\r\nproduces barley is at the same time generally sown with peas or beans,\r\nand then it comes in routine to be again fallowed the third year.”[16]\r\nThis gives us the following rotation of crops: (1), wheat; (2), oats;\r\n(3), fallow; (4), barley; (5), peas or beans; (6), fallow. This was the\r\nsystem prevailing in Huntingdon.\r\n\r\n [16] Maxwell, “Huntingdon,” p. 9.\r\n\r\nThe same system prevailed in the heavy clay lands of Bedfordshire,\r\nbut in the lighter lands sometimes a four-field course was adopted,\r\nsometimes the half of the nominally fallow field that had the previous\r\nyear given crops of wheat and oats was sown with turnips, and clover\r\nwas sown with barley the succeeding year.[17]\r\n\r\n [17] T. Stone, “Bedfordshire,” p. 8.\r\n\r\nThe commonest four-field course is that described for Isleham,\r\nCambridgeshire: (1), wheat; (2), barley; (3), pulse or oats; (4),\r\nfallow; the fallow field being dunged or folded with sheep. At Castle\r\nCamps, also in Cambridge, a two-field course of alternate crop and\r\nfallow obtained.[18]\r\n\r\n [18] Vancouver, “Cambridgeshire,” p. 33.\r\n\r\nComing further south for Hertfordshire, we are told that the “common\r\nfields are mostly by agreement among the owners and occupiers\r\ncultivated nearly in the same way as in the enclosed state.”[19] In\r\nBuckinghamshire the regular three-fields course was followed in some\r\nparts, but in Upton, Eton, Dorney, Datchett, Maysbury and Horton, “the\r\noccupiers have exploded entirely the old usage of two crops and a\r\nfallow, and now have a crop every year.”\r\n\r\n [19] D. Walker, “Hertfordshire,” p. 49.\r\n\r\nTwo Buckinghamshire parishes underwent experiences which have been\r\nwrongly cited as typical of the inconveniences of common fields,\r\nwhereas they are rather instances of the lawless conduct of village\r\nbullies. Steeple Claydon had 2500 acres of common field, on which the\r\ncustomary course was one crop and a fallow. “About fourteen years ago”\r\n(_i.e._, about 1779) “the proprietors came to an agreement to have two\r\ncrops and a fallow, but before the expiration of ten years one of the\r\nfarmers broke through the agreement, and turned in his cattle upon the\r\ncrops of beans, oats and barley, in which plan he was soon followed by\r\nthe rest.”[20] The agreement, if that of a three-fourths majority (see\r\nbelow), was legally binding on all owners and occupiers, and the first\r\nfarmer was liable to the same pains and penalties as if he had turned\r\nhis cattle into crops standing on enclosed fields belonging to another\r\nfarm. Possibly, however, the crops were a failure, and feeding them off\r\nwith cattle was as good a way of dealing with them as another.\r\n\r\n [20] William James and Jacob Malcolm, “Buckingham,” p. 30.\r\n\r\nA still more difficult case to understand is that of Wendon (3000 acres\r\ncommon field). It is reported as follows:--“About fourteen years\r\nago the parishioners came to an agreement and obtained an Act to lay\r\nthe small pieces of land together.... When the division took place,\r\nthe balks were of necessity ploughed up, by which a great portion of\r\nthe sheep pasture was destroyed.[21] It then became expedient, and\r\nit was agreed upon at public vestry, to sow clover and turnips as\r\na succedaneum for the balks. Two years since, one of the farmers,\r\noccupying 16 acres of these common fields, procured in the month of May\r\na large flock of lean sheep, which he turned on the clover crops; being\r\nthen nearly in bloom, the greater part of which they devoured.”\r\n\r\n [21] James and Malcolm, “Buckingham,” p. 29. I have been unable to\r\n find any trace of this Act.\r\n\r\nOf Oxfordshire we are told “the present course of husbandry is so\r\nvarious, particularly in the open fields, that to treat of all the\r\ndifferent ways of management would render this report too voluminous.\r\nIt may suffice generally to remark that some fields are in the course\r\nof one crop and fallow, others of two, and a few of three crops and\r\na fallow. In divers unenclosed parishes the same rotation prevails\r\nover the whole of the open fields; but in others, the more homeward\r\nor bettermost land is oftener cropped, or sometimes cropped every\r\nyear.”[22] Where one crop and a fallow was the custom the crop might\r\nbe wheat, barley or oats; and sometimes tares were sown on the fallow\r\nfield and cut green. The three and four-field systems prevalent were\r\nthose described above.\r\n\r\n [22] Richard Davis, “Oxfordshire,” p. 11.\r\n\r\nIn Berkshire a six-year course, evidently evolved from an older\r\nthree-years course, was found:--(1), wheat; (2), barley; (3), oats,\r\nwith seeds; (4), clover, mowed, and then grazed upon in common; (5),\r\noats or barley; (6), fallow.\r\n\r\nAn agreement to withhold turning out stock during the time in which\r\na field was commonable by ancient custom, in order that turnips,\r\nvetches, etc., might be grown, was practised, and termed “hitching\r\nthe fields.”[23] We get the same expression for Wiltshire, where\r\na part of a field set aside for vetches, peas, beans, turnips, or\r\npotatoes was called a “hookland” or “hitchland” field.[24] In Wiltshire\r\ncustoms similar to these described as surviving recently in Stratton\r\nand Grimstone were prevalent; clover was generally substituted for\r\nfallow, and was partly mowed for the individual benefit of particular\r\noccupiers, and partly fed upon by the village flock. The following\r\nsystems are reported:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) First, wheat; second, barley with clover; third, clover part\r\nmowed, part fed.\r\n\r\n(_b_) First, wheat; second, barley; third, oats with clover; fourth,\r\nclover part mowed, part fed.\r\n\r\n(_c_) First, wheat; second, barley with clover; third, clover mowed;\r\nfourth, clover fed (one-third or a quarter of this field being\r\n“hitchland”).[25]\r\n\r\n [23] William Pearce, “Berkshire,” p. 29.\r\n\r\n [24] Thomas Davis, “Wiltshire,” p. 43.\r\n\r\n [25] Thomas Davis, “Wiltshire,” p. 43.\r\n\r\nTurning northwards again from the centre of England, in Rutland the\r\nold three-year course of two crops and a fallow was universal in\r\nthe unenclosed parishes;[26] in Lincoln two, three and four-field\r\nsystems were practised;[27] the two-field course was also prevalent in\r\nYorkshire.[28]\r\n\r\n [26] John Crutchley, “Rutland,” p. 8.\r\n\r\n [27] Thomas Stone, “Lincoln,” p. 26.\r\n\r\n [28] Isaac Leatham, “East Riding,” p. 40.\r\n\r\nA singular practice was followed in the East Riding Wolds. “The greater\r\npart of the Wold townships which lie open have a great quantity of\r\nout-field in leyland, _i.e._, land from which they take a crop every\r\nthird, fourth, fifth, or sixth year, according to the custom of the\r\ntownship.”[29]\r\n\r\n [29] Isaac Leatham, “East Riding,” p. 42.\r\n\r\nIn contrast we may mention the Battersea common fields, which were\r\n“sown with one uniform round of grain without intermission and\r\nconsequently without fallowing.”[30]\r\n\r\n [30] James and Malcolm, “Surrey,” p. 48.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nNORFOLK AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we come to Norfolk we find hints at so many special features that\r\nNorfolk agriculture demands separate treatment. The preamble of a\r\nNorfolk Enclosure Act is remarkably different from those for the rest\r\nof the country. A typical one is 1795, c. 67:\r\n\r\n“Whereas there are in the parish of Sedgeford in the county of Norfolk\r\ndivers lands and grounds, called whole-year lands, brecks, common\r\nfields, half-year or shack lands, commons and waste grounds.... And\r\nwhereas there are certain rights of sheep-walk, shackage and common,\r\nover the said brecks, half-year or shack land, commons and waste\r\ngrounds. And great part of the said whole-year lands, as well as the\r\nbrecks, common fields, and half-year or shack lands, are inconveniently\r\nsituated,” etc.\r\n\r\nOr again 1804, c. 24:\r\n\r\n“Whereas there are in the parish of Waborne in the county of Norfolk\r\ndivers lands and grounds called whole-year lands, common fields, doles,\r\nhalf-year or shack lands, commons and waste grounds.”\r\n\r\n“Whereas the said common fields, doles, half-year lands, shack lands,\r\ncommons and waste grounds, are subject to certain rights of sheep-walk,\r\nshackage and common, and great part of the said whole-year lands,\r\ncommon fields, and half-year or shack lands are inconveniently situated\r\nfor the various owners and proprietors thereof....”\r\n\r\nOther Norfolk acts mention doles, ings, carrs, and buscallys. Buscallys\r\nwe may take to mean woods in which rights of common for fuel were\r\npractised. Dr. Murray’s Dictionary gives us bushaile or buscayle, from\r\nOld French _boschaille_, Low Latin _boscalia_, shrubberies, thickets,\r\netc. “Dole,” is connected etymologically both with “deal” and with the\r\nword “run-dale,” concerning which see below. The word is frequently\r\nfound elsewhere, as in the “dolemeads” at Bristol and Bath, and usually\r\nmeans meadows, the ownership of which is intermixed in small parcels,\r\nwhich are commonable after hay harvest, but sometimes the word is\r\nused of arable land (see below). The Act for Earsham, Ditchingham and\r\nHedenham (Norfolk, 1812, c. 17) has the sentence, “The said dole meadow\r\nlands lie intermixed and dispersed.” The “ings” and “carrs” are best\r\nunderstood by the help of the old Ordnance Survey map for Norfolk. The\r\ncarrs are the lowest, swampiest part of the common pastures which reach\r\ndown to the rivers; the ings, while also low-lying, are separated from\r\nthe rivers by the carrs, and intervene between the carrs and the tilled\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThere remain the expressions whole-year lands, half-year or shack\r\nlands, and brecks, to interpret.\r\n\r\nHalf-year lands obviously means lands commonable for half the year,\r\n_i.e._, after the crop has been carried. They are also “shack” lands,\r\nor lands on which right of “shackage” exists. “Shack” is connected with\r\n“shake,” and right of shackage appears to be the right to carry off the\r\ngleanings after the crop has been carried and the fields are thrown\r\nopen. It is, however, to be noticed that half-year or shack lands are\r\nmentioned as something distinct from common fields. The distinction\r\nis said to be that common rights on shack lands can be exercised only\r\nby the owners or occupiers of those lands. Shack lands may be termed\r\ncommon fields, but the term common field may be reserved for those\r\nfields over which cottagers or toft holders or others also possess\r\nrights of common.\r\n\r\n“Brecks” are asserted by William Marshall (“Rural Economy of Norfolk,”\r\nVol. I., p. 376) to be “large new-made enclosures,” but as is seen from\r\nthe wording of the Acts quoted, they are enclosures still “subject to\r\ncertain rights of shackage, sheep-walk, and common.”[31] Lastly, what\r\nare “whole-year lands”?\r\n\r\n [31] 1820, c. 29 (Blakeney, Wiverton and Glanford) mentions\r\n “whole-year lands, whole-year brecks, whole-year marshes.” In this\r\n case, apparently, brecks are not commonable.\r\n\r\nSince half-year lands are lands which for half the year are common, and\r\nfor half the year are in individual ownership and use, one would argue\r\nthat whole-year lands must be lands which are in individual ownership\r\nand use the whole year; for if they were common the whole year they\r\nwould be termed simply “commons.” We get further light by comparing\r\nthe preambles of other Norfolk Acts. Some instead of whole-year lands\r\nmention every-year lands, others speak of “whole-year or every-year\r\nlands,” while finally Icklingham in Suffolk (1813, c. 29) gives us\r\n“every year lands or Infields.”\r\n\r\nNow “infields” is a familiar expression in Scottish agriculture.\r\nEven in the Lothians, up to the middle of the eighteenth century the\r\ncultivated land was divided into infield and outfield. The outfield,\r\nlike the outfield on the Yorkshire Wolds, only bore occasional crops,\r\nand was never manured, all the manure being reserved for the infield,\r\nwhich was made to bear a crop every year. In Haddington the customary\r\ncourse was: (1) pease; (2) wheat; (3) barley; (4) oats; and then the\r\nland was dunged and planted with pease again; and leases stipulated for\r\n“the preservation and regular dunging of the mucked land shotts.”[32]\r\nSuch lands might obviously be described as every-year lands, and since\r\nthis method of cultivation implies that immediately one crop is carried\r\npreparation must be made for the next, and therefore is not easily\r\nconsistent with common rights, so these lands are also “whole-year\r\nlands.” It may be noted that the Norfolk preambles (as in the\r\nSedgeford example, quoted above), while stating that the “whole-year\r\nlands,” as well as the brecks, common fields and half-year lands are\r\ninconveniently situated, _i.e._, are intermixed, by implication give\r\nus to understand that they are not subject to rights of shackage,\r\nsheep-walk, and common.\r\n\r\n [32] George Buchan Hepburn, “Agriculture of East Lothian,” 1794, p. 49.\r\n\r\nIt is the more curious to find that Norfolk and the adjoining part\r\nof Suffolk followed a traditional method of cultivation in this\r\nrespect similar to that of the East of Scotland, because there are\r\nso few traces of anything similar in the intervening counties. I find\r\ninfields mentioned twice in Northumberland, once in Lincoln, whole-year\r\nlands once in Huntingdon. There is also mention of half-year lands\r\nin Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire. The Wessex custom of “hitching the\r\nfields,” or “cropping the homeward or bettermost part of the common\r\nfields every year” is not the same thing, because there, as we saw\r\nin the case of Stratton and Grimstone, the extra crop was raised for\r\ncommon, not for individual, benefit. Battersea common fields were\r\nworked as every-year lands, and so are the Axholme fields to-day; but\r\nin these cases the custom was locally derived from some other form of\r\ncultivation; whereas in Norfolk and Suffolk the peculiar customs must\r\nhave been indigenous and ancient.\r\n\r\nOne is also tempted to ask whether it is a coincidence that Norfolk\r\nfarmers in the latter half of the eighteenth century, and Lothian\r\nfarmers in the nineteenth, enjoyed and deserved an extremely high\r\nreputation for scientific, enterprising, and skilful agriculture.\r\nThe ancient custom of raising crops every year from the same land\r\nmust have necessitated the gradual accumulation of knowledge on the\r\nbest ways of preventing exhaustion of the soil, by marling, manuring,\r\ndeep ploughing, and various rotations of crops. When turnip culture\r\nwas introduced into England, it was to Norfolk that the new idea was\r\nbrought. There was no obstacle to growing turnips on the Norfolk\r\nwhole-year lands, such as would have arisen if toft holders had the\r\nright to turn horses, cattle and sheep on to the lands at Lammas; and\r\nthe intervention of a new crop which gave an opportunity for getting\r\nthe land clean of weeds, and increased its fertility for grain crops,\r\nwas a far more obvious boon there than on lands subject to a periodic\r\nfallow.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the typical Norfolk Enclosure Act preamble. We have\r\nonly half explained the problem suggested by the four different names,\r\neach evidently with a distinct meaning, but all meaning arable land in\r\nwhich ownership is intermixed as in an ordinary common field, viz.,\r\nwhole-year lands, half-year lands or shack lands, brecks and common\r\nfields. The rest of the explanation is, I think, to be looked for\r\nin the direction suggested by the prominence given to the statement,\r\n“They are subject to rights of sheep-walk.” Elsewhere one finds a close\r\nconnection between sheep and common fields. Thus we have seen that at\r\nEakring certain common right owners make a speciality of pasturing\r\nsheep on the common fields. The Swedish traveller Kaln, whose account\r\nof his visit to England has recently been translated into English,\r\nobserved the same thing on the open field parishes of Hertfordshire and\r\nBedfordshire in the year 1748 (p. 302). But in 1793 where there were\r\nopen chalky downs in open field parishes the right of pasturing sheep\r\non the downs and of having the combined flock of the village folded\r\nover the arable in the common field was valued too highly by every\r\noccupier to be ceded to an individual speculator (Davies, “Wiltshire,”\r\npp. 8, 15, 61, 80). In these cases right of common for sheep has been\r\ndemocratically shared.\r\n\r\nBut this is not universal. The Enclosure Commissioners, in their\r\nthirty-eighth report (1883), record the application for an Enclosure\r\nAct for Hildersham, Cambridgeshire. In this parish the two _manor\r\nfarms_ had the right of turning their sheep every sixth year on to the\r\nstubbles of the other farms. Similarly, I am told by Major Barnard, of\r\nCheltenham, that in the Cambridgeshire parish of Bartlow, where he was\r\nborn, which was enclosed with Shudy Camps and Castle Camps in 1863,\r\nthat the right of feeding sheep on the common fields belonged to the\r\nlord of the manor only. These Cambridgeshire parishes are close to the\r\nborders of Norfolk and Suffolk, and the following passage from Tusser’s\r\n“Champion and Several” (date 1573) suggests the same rule as applying\r\nto Norfolk and the “champion” (_i.e._, open field) part of Suffolk:--\r\n\r\n    _In Norfolk behold the despair_\r\n      Of tillage, too much to be born,\r\n    By drovers, from fair to fair,\r\n      And others, destroying the corn,\r\n    By custom, and covetous pates\r\n    By gaps and by opening of gates.\r\n\r\n    What speak I of commoners by\r\n      With drawing all after a line;\r\n    So noying the corn as it lie,\r\n      With cattle, with conies and swine,\r\n    When thou hast bestowed thy cost\r\n    Look half of the same to be lost.\r\n\r\n    _The flocks of the lords of the soil_\r\n      Do yearly the winter corn wrong,\r\n    The same in a maner they spoil\r\n      With feeding so low and so long,\r\n    And therefore that champion field\r\n    Doth seldom good winter corn yield.\r\n\r\nIf it be urged that the two italicised lines are not necessarily\r\nto be read together, in view of the other topics touched on in the\r\nintermediate lines, the argument is not much affected, for Tusser shows\r\nno knowledge of any “champion” counties other than Leicestershire,\r\nCambridgeshire, and Norfolk, and elsewhere in the poem he deals with\r\nthe special evils afflicting the two former counties.\r\n\r\nI may also refer to the Act, 25 Henry VIII. c. 13, to limit the number\r\nof sheep which may be possessed by a single owner, in which occurs the\r\npassage:--\r\n\r\nX. Be it also further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That no\r\nmanner of Person or Persons, of what Degree soever he or they be, being\r\nLord or Lords, Owner or Owners, Farmer or Farmers, of or in any Liberty\r\nof Fold Courses within any Town, Tything, Village or Hamlet within any\r\nof the Counties of Norfolk or Suffolk, from and after the Feast of the\r\nNativity of our Lord God next coming, shall take in farm, for term of\r\nyears or otherwise, any Quillets of Lands or Pastures, that is to say,\r\nany number of Acres of Land or Pasture appertaining to any other Person\r\nor Persons, lying and being within the limit Extent or Precinct of\r\nthe said Liberty of the said Fold Courses; but that they shall permit\r\nand suffer the said Persons, having or being, for the time, Owner or\r\nOwners, Lessee or Lessees of the said Quillets, to manure and pasture\r\nthe said Quillets; and also to suffer sheep of the said Owner or\r\nOwners, Farmer or Farmers of the said Quillets, after the Rate of the\r\nsaid Quillets, to go with the Flock of the Owner, Farmer or Occupier\r\nof the said Liberty or Liberties of the said Fold Courses, paying the\r\ncustomary charge for the same, after the Rate and Use of the Country,\r\nthere commonly used, without any interruption therein to be made by\r\nthe said Owner or Owners, Farmer or Farmers, or Occupiers of the said\r\nLiberties, upon pain of forfeiture for 3_s._ 4_d._ for each offence.\r\n\r\n“XI. Provided ... it shall not ... be available to any tenant Owner\r\nor Occupier of any such Quillet or Quillets to claim, have or use\r\nhereafter any such pasture, or Feeding of his sheep, in or with any\r\nsuch Fold Courses, but only where the tenants, Owners and Occupiers of\r\nany such Quillets have had, or might have had heretofore of Right and\r\nDuty, or used to have Pasture and Feeding in the said Fold Courses,\r\nby reason of their tenures, and Occupations of the said Quillet and\r\nQuillets, and none otherwise; and where they have not used, nor ought\r\nto have any Sheep fed or kept within such Fold Courses, by reason of\r\nthe said tenures, that the Owners or Occupiers of such Fold Courses may\r\ntake such Quillets, lying within their Fold Courses, in Farm, agreeing\r\nwith the Owners or Occupiers of the said Quillets for the same.”\r\n\r\nIt would appear from these clauses that there had been in still earlier\r\ntimes generally throughout Norfolk and Suffolk a right pertaining\r\nto the Lord of the Manor of feeding flocks of sheep over the whole\r\nmanor, that this right, in the reign of Henry VIII. was frequently\r\nsold or leased under the denomination “A Liberty of Fold Courses”;\r\nsecondly that the exercise of this right was apt to interfere with\r\nthe cultivation of peasants’ holdings in the common fields; thirdly\r\nthat it was customary for the sheep belonging to the peasants to be\r\npastured and folded with the flock of the Lord of the Manor for a fixed\r\ncustomary fee.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another respect in which Norfolk agriculture shows\r\na difference, but of degree, not kind, from other common-field\r\nagriculture. Complete enclosure of common-field arable involves three\r\nprocesses--\r\n\r\n(1) The laying together of scattered properties, and consequent\r\nabolition of intermixture of properties and holdings;\r\n\r\n(2) The abolition of common rights;\r\n\r\n(3) The hedging and ditching of the separate properties. This third\r\nprocess is the actual “enclosing” which gives its name to a series of\r\nprocesses which it completes.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the hedging and ditching takes place independently of\r\nthe other two processes, and strips of an acre, two or more acres, and\r\neven half-an-acre are enclosed in the middle of the common-fields,\r\nand, what is more remarkable, the little enclosed strips are sometimes\r\nthe property of several individuals. In the collection of maps of open\r\nfield parishes belonging to certain Oxford Colleges, published by Mr.\r\nJ. L. G. Mowat, several such instances may be noticed.\r\n\r\nSuch enclosures were at first commonable; but common rights were of\r\ncourse exercised over them with greater difficulty than over the\r\nopen parts of the enclosed fields, a fact on which the above quoted\r\nopinion on the Barn farm at Elmstone Hardwicke incidentally throws\r\nsome light. The maintenance of these common rights is a sort of test\r\nof the democratic vigour of the village, and it may be noticed that\r\nold enclosures subject to common rights were particularly numerous in\r\nYorkshire.\r\n\r\nNorfolk was remarkable for the extent to which actual hedging and\r\nditching preceded legal enclosure. The Board of Agriculture reporter\r\nsays, “for notwithstanding common rights for great cattle exist in all\r\nof them,[33] and even sheep-walk privileges in many, yet the natural\r\nindustry of the people is such, that wherever a person can get four\r\nor five acres together, he plants a white-thorn hedge round it, and\r\nsets an oak at every rod distance, which is consented to by a kind of\r\ngeneral courtesy from one neighbour to another.”[34]\r\n\r\n [33] _I.e._, of the enclosures he is going to describe.\r\n\r\n [34] Nathaniel Kent, “Norfolk,” p. 22.\r\n\r\nTwo Acts incidentally show to what an extent such hedges enclosed\r\nlands belonging to two or more proprietors. One Norfolk Act has the\r\nprovision, “All enclosures where two or more proprietors are connected\r\nand where the property is not separated by a hedge or ditch shall be\r\ndeemed to be Common Field.” The same clause differently expressed\r\noccurs in the Act for Ormesby and Scratby (1842, c. 9): “All old\r\nenclosures within the said parishes in which there are lands belonging\r\nto different proprietors, shall be deemed to be open Fields.”\r\n\r\nA brief account of a surviving Norfolk open field parish is given in\r\nAppendix E., p. 331.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n13 GEO. III. C. 81.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking and interesting features of the open field\r\nvillage life is the existence of a self-governing constitution for the\r\nsettlement of disputes, and the most profitable use of the village\r\nlands--the annual meetings of farmers and common-right owners; the\r\ninstitution of field reeves and field juries; the division among\r\ncommoners of the profits of the common property. One cannot but look\r\nupon this as the survival of an ancient village communal life, which\r\nmust have been much stronger and more vigorous in earlier days, when\r\neach village was more of a self-contained and isolated economic unit;\r\nand particularly while the co-operative ploughing persisted, from\r\nwhich the intermixture of lands in common field arable is admitted\r\nto have originated. Even in its degenerate state, when co-operative\r\nploughing has been extinct for generations, the open field parish\r\ninvolves a certain partnership among the cultivators, necessitating\r\nsome recognised rules, mutual consultation, and organised combination:\r\nhow much more binding the necessity must have been in the Middle Ages?\r\nHence from the very necessity of the case, there must have been a bond\r\nbetween the village workers, such as is conveyed by the words “village\r\ncommunity,” which probably preceded, and underlay as a foundation,\r\nthe better known manorial and parochial institutions, the manorial\r\norganisation arising from the contact between the village community\r\nand the Central Government, or outside enemies, the parochial from its\r\ncontact with the Church.\r\n\r\nBut while these features of common-field management in general are\r\nsurvivals of “the village community,” it is possible _in any particular\r\nvillage_ that such institutions and customs were the creation of the\r\nlegislature since the latter part of the eighteenth century. For in\r\nthe year 1773 a noteworthy Act was passed for the better regulation of\r\nthe culture of common arable fields. It enacts that “where there are\r\nopen or common field lands, all the Tillage or Arable lands lying in\r\nthe said open or Common Fields, shall be ordered, fenced, cultivated or\r\nimproved, in such manner as three-fourths in number and value of the\r\noccupiers shall agree, with consent of the owner and tithe-owner.”\r\n\r\nSuch agreements were to be binding for six years, or two _rounds_,\r\n“according to the ancient and established course of each parish or\r\nplace”; _i.e._, presumably, in a parish where the ancient customary\r\ncourse had been one crop and a fallow, the agreement was binding for\r\nfour years; where it had been three crops and a fallow, for eight\r\nyears. Further, every year between the 21st and 24th of May a field\r\nreeve or field reeves were to be elected. These field reeves, acting\r\nunder the instructions of a three-fourths majority in number and value,\r\nmight delay the opening of the common fields, might give permission\r\nfor any balks, slades or meers (those words are synonyms) to be\r\nploughed up, an equivalent piece of land being laid down in common, and\r\nboundary stones being put down instead. Since this Act was designed\r\nin the interest of better cultivation, and for the advantage of the\r\nproprietors and large occupiers, special provision is made that if the\r\ncottagers owning common rights feel themselves prejudiced, they may\r\nclaim to have a separate piece of land set out as a common for them.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Act was to enable the common-field system to be\r\nadjusted to the new agriculture of the eighteenth century, which was\r\nmarked by the introduction of turnips, artificial grasses, and the\r\nabandonment of frequent fallowing. A precise account of the adoption of\r\na scheme under the Act is given us by the prime mover.\r\n\r\nIn the township of Hunmanby, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the\r\ncultivators had fallen into one of the besetting temptations to which\r\n“champion” farmers were liable. They had gradually extended the arable\r\nfields at the expense of the common pasture, till the manure produced\r\nby the latter was insufficient for the needs of the former, and the\r\nland was losing its fertility. Isaac Leatham got his brother farmers\r\nto agree to abandon the old (three-year) course of husbandry, and to\r\nsubstitute the following six-year course:--\r\n\r\n  1. Turnips, hoed, and fed off with sheep.\r\n  2. Barley with grass seed.\r\n  3. Grass.\r\n  4. Grass.\r\n  5. Wheat.\r\n  6. Oats or peas.\r\n\r\nThe grass seed sown with the barley was bought in common, and paid for\r\nproportionately. From the time the barley was carried until it was\r\ntime to plough for the wheat crop, one gathers that the grass, which\r\nhad been sown with the barley, was being fed with sheep; therefore, at\r\nany particular time after the course was established, half the common\r\nfield area was feeding sheep, or growing turnips for sheep, and half\r\nwas growing grain or pulse. The sheep flock was managed in common; each\r\noccupier was allowed to contribute sheep to it in proportion to his\r\nholding; the whole was under the care of two shepherds, who folded the\r\nsheep nightly upon different strips of land in succession, so that all\r\noccupiers received equal benefit. Field reeves were appointed.\r\n\r\n“Thus,” says Isaac Leatham, “an open field is enjoyed in as beneficial\r\na manner as if it were enclosed ... two persons are fully sufficient\r\nto attend the sheep-stock, instead of many ... the precarious rearing\r\nof fences is avoided, and the immense expense of continually repairing\r\nthem saved.”[35]\r\n\r\n [35] Isaac Leatham, “East Riding,” p. 46.\r\n\r\nI take it that Isaac Leatham, who, by the way, was a strong advocate of\r\nenclosure in general, meant that the open field was, _on the whole_,\r\nenjoyed in as beneficial a manner as if it were enclosed, because\r\nthere still remained the great disadvantage that each occupier had\r\nhis lands in widely scattered strips, and had to waste much time and\r\nlabour in cultivating them; cross-ploughing, which might, or might not\r\nhave been desirable, was any way impossible; the village lands had to\r\nbe treated as one whole, so no enterprising and original man was able\r\nto experiment with new ideas, nor could any further improvement be\r\nadopted without the consent of a three-fourths majority; and, perhaps,\r\nthe keeping of sheep in a common flock put obstacles in the way of\r\nimproving the breed.\r\n\r\nI may add that an Act for the enclosure of Hunmanby was passed in the\r\nyear 1800, so that Isaac Leatham’s course was abandoned just seven\r\nyears after he wrote about it so triumphantly.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1773, therefore, was, perhaps, not a brilliant success in\r\nHunmanby; perhaps, on the other hand, improved agriculture excited an\r\nappetite for further improvement, and one novelty having been accepted,\r\nthe stiff conservatism which might have postponed enclosure, was broken\r\ndown. But, as a glance at the map for the East Riding will show, the\r\nwhole countryside was subject to a rage for enclosure, and the famine\r\nprices for grain of 1796, doomed to recur again in 1800–1, in 1812, and\r\n1817, were acting as a powerful solvent to all old agricultural customs.\r\n\r\nIt is quite obvious that the Act of 1773 was an endeavour to select out\r\nof the customs and traditions prevailing in different villages those\r\nwhich were most in harmony with advanced agriculture, to further amend\r\nthese, and to make them universal.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, Hunmanby is the only place where it has been recorded\r\nas having been put into execution, and it has been doubted whether\r\nit was not practically a dead letter. My own impression is that\r\nthe distribution of the “sicks” at Laxton was consciously arranged\r\nin accordance with the provisions of the Act, that originally the\r\nmethod of choosing the fallow crops in Castor and Ailesworth was an\r\napplication of it, and also the six years’ course used for part of\r\nthe fields of Barrowden and Luffenham, but I can bring no evidence to\r\nsupport this view. If, however, it is correct, the Act may have been\r\nof considerable use to many other parishes also by clearly defining\r\nmethods of procedure which otherwise would be determined by custom\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nENCLOSURE AND DEPOPULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very word “enclosure” to a historical student suggests\r\n“depopulation.” The two words are almost treated as synonyms in Acts of\r\nParliament, tracts, and official documents of the sixteenth century.\r\nIn the seventeenth century we find the proverbs, “Horn and thorn shall\r\nmake England forlorn,” “Inclosures make fat beasts and lean poor\r\npeople,” while the superstition grew up that inclosed land was cursed,\r\nand must within three generations pass away from the families of “these\r\nmadded and irreligious depopulators,” these “dispeoplers of towns,\r\nruiners of commonwealths, occasioners of beggary ... cruell inclosiers.”\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration, the literary attack on enclosure becomes more\r\nfeeble, the defence more powerful. W. Wales in 1781, the Rev. J.\r\nHowlett in 1786, published statistics to show that enclosure had the\r\neffect of increasing the population, the latter tract being widely\r\nquoted; there ceased to be any opposition from the Central Government\r\nto enclosure, and private Acts were passed in continually increasing\r\nnumbers; finally the one practical measure carried through by the Board\r\nof Agriculture was the General Enclosure Act of 1801, to simplify\r\nand cheapen Parliamentary proceedings. Dr. Cunningham sums up the\r\ncase as follows: “He (Joseph Massie) was aware that enclosing had\r\nmeant rural depopulation in the sixteenth century, and he too hastily\r\nassumed that the enclosing which had been proceeding in the eighteenth\r\ncentury was attended with similar results; but the conditions of the\r\ntime were entirely changed. Despite the reiterated allegation,[36]\r\nit is impossible to believe that enclosing in the eighteenth century\r\nimplied either more pasture farming or less employment for labour.\r\nThe prohibition of export kept down the price of wool; the bounty on\r\nexportation gave direct encouragement to corn-growing; the improved\r\nagriculture gave more employment to labour than the old.”[37]\r\n\r\n [36] By the opponents of enclosure.\r\n\r\n [37] “Growth of English Industry and Commerce,” Vol. II., p. 384\r\n (1892).\r\n\r\nTaken in one sense, I must admit the substantial accuracy of this\r\nopinion. On the other hand I am disposed to maintain the general\r\naccuracy of the statements with regard to depopulation made by the\r\nopponents of enclosure, (_a_) provided these statements are understood\r\nin the sense in which they are meant, and (_b_) statements only with\r\nregard to the part of the country the writer is familiar with are\r\nregarded, and his inferences with regard to other parts are neglected.\r\n\r\nFor it must be remembered that side by side with the movement for the\r\nenclosure of arable fields, there was going on a movement for the\r\nenclosure of wastes. From Appendix A. it will be seen that 577 Acts for\r\nenclosing wastes and common pastures were passed between 1702 and 1802,\r\nand over 800,000 acres were so added to the cultivated area of England\r\nand Wales. There were besides enclosures occasionally on a large scale\r\nby landed proprietors of wastes on which either common rights were not\r\nexercised, or on which they were too feebly maintained to necessitate\r\nan Act. The Board of Agriculture report for Notts records that 10,666\r\nacres had recently been so enclosed from Sherwood Forest alone.[38]\r\nLastly there was the continual pushing forward of cultivation by\r\nfarmers, squatters, etc. It is impossible to do more than form a vague\r\nguess as to the quantity of land so enclosed, but reasons will be given\r\nlater for the belief that it was far greater than the area of commons\r\nand waste enclosed by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n [38] Robert Lowe, “Nottingham,” Appendix.\r\n\r\nNow the opponents of enclosure of the sixteenth, seventeenth _and_\r\neighteenth centuries almost without exception opposed simply the\r\nenclosure of arable common fields; they usually expressly approve\r\nthe enclosure of waste, as increasing the means of subsistence of\r\nthe people. The advocates of enclosure on the other hand are equally\r\nconcerned in advocating both kinds of enclosure. Hence we have\r\nstatements to the effect that the enclosure of arable fields in the\r\n“champion” districts of England (_i.e._, the part much shaded on\r\nthe map) caused rural depopulation, met by statistics and arguments\r\nto prove that all kinds of enclosure proceeding over all parts of\r\nEngland and Wales, on the whole, tended to increase population,\r\nurban and rural. Through looseness of wording on both sides, the\r\ncontroversialists seem to be contradicting one another; whereas, in\r\nreality, both might equally be right.\r\n\r\nAt the present day this particular issue is dead, though a similar\r\nquestion, the question whether by means of the modern representative of\r\nthe open field, viz., the allotment field, and modern representative\r\nof the ancient co-operative ploughing, viz., co-operative purchase of\r\nmachines, manures and seeds, borrowing of capital, sale of produce,\r\nand perhaps co-operative stockbreeding, the decay of the agricultural\r\npopulation can be arrested, is a living issue. Nor is there any period\r\nof the nineteenth century in which any serious rural depopulation as a\r\nresult of enclosure, and consequent laying down in pasture, of common\r\nfields, could be asserted. Since Free Trade began to seriously affect\r\nthe prices of British grain--and that was not for a good many years\r\nafter 1846--the common fields have been too few, and the other forces\r\ntending towards rural depopulation too great, for this particular force\r\nto be felt. And if it were felt, no one would seriously urge that the\r\nhardly pressed farmer should be compelled to cultivate the land in\r\na manner wasteful of labour, in order that more labourers might be\r\nemployed. In the earlier part of the nineteenth century war, protection\r\nand a rapidly growing wealth and population so effectively encouraged\r\ntillage that attempted prohibition of conversion of arable to grass\r\nwould have been superfluous.\r\n\r\nYet much, I think, can be learnt on the historical question from the\r\npresent aspect of the country, even by anyone who merely travels by\r\nexpress train through the Midlands. Having spent a day in traversing\r\nthe length and breadth of the great fields of Castor and Ailesworth,\r\nyellow with wheat and barley or recently cut stubble, I went straight\r\nthrough the county of Northamptonshire, seeing on either side scarcely\r\nanything but permanent pasture. From Northampton to Leicester was the\r\nsame thing; again from Leicester to Uppingham. Just beyond Uppingham\r\nthe cornfields become far more extensive; what were the Rutlandshire\r\ncommon fields till 1881 are still mainly under tillage. All this\r\ncountry of permanent pasture was mainly enclosed during the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Very frequently one can see on heavy land the old ridges piled\r\nup in the middle, ending in the middle of one field, crossing hedges,\r\nand showing plainly that very little, if any, ploughing has been done\r\nsince the enclosure was effected.[39] The impression made on my mind\r\nby this apparent confirmation of all that the denouncers of “cruell\r\nInclosiers” alleged was a very powerful one.\r\n\r\n [39] Arthur Young (“Eastern Tour,” Vol. I., p. 54) noticed this in\r\n 1771 in the great pasture closes of Northamptonshire: “All this fine\r\n grass on so excellent a soil lies all in the broad ridge and furrow.”\r\n\r\nBefore examining the evidence for and against rural depopulation in\r\nparticular parts of England as the result of the extinction of common\r\nfields, it is well to consider the _a priori_ arguments put forward by\r\nDr. Cunningham.\r\n\r\nIt is urged, in the first place, that owing to the relatively high\r\nprice of corn and low price of wool, there was no motive for lay-down\r\narable as pasture. Dr. Cunningham seems to ignore the fact that sheep\r\nand cattle produce mutton, beef, milk, butter, cheese, and hides, as\r\nwell as wool, and it is by the profit to be derived from all of these\r\nproducts together, and not from any one of them, that the question of\r\nlaying down in pasture will be determined. That laying down arable\r\nin pasture was profitable is indicated by the surprise Arthur Young\r\nexpressed in 1768 that landlords did not enclose, and put the land\r\nto grass, on passing through Bedfordshire,[40] and by Adam Smith’s\r\nreference in “The Wealth of Nations” to the exceptional rent commanded\r\nby enclosed pasture.[41] We have, further, the clear statement of the\r\nBoard of Agriculture: “Whereas the price of corn from 1760 to 1794\r\nwas almost stationary, the products of grass land have risen greatly\r\nthroughout nearly the whole of that period.”[42] William Pitt, again,\r\nin a pamphlet published by the Board in 1812 on the “Food Produced from\r\nArable and Grass Land,” says that through the “increased luxury of the\r\ntimes more beef and mutton and butter are used than formerly, even by\r\nequal numbers, and consequently more inducement to throw all the best\r\ncorn to grass” (p. 35). William Culley adds in a footnote that “In the\r\nNorthern Counties more rent per acre is given for ploughing than for\r\ngrazing farms ... more rent is given for grazing than for arable farms\r\nin the Southern Counties.” If this was so when famine prices were paid\r\nfor wheat, how much more in normal times?\r\n\r\n [40] “Northern Tour,” 2nd. ed., p. 56.\r\n\r\n [41] McCulloch’s ed., p. 69.\r\n\r\n [42] “General Report on Enclosures,” p. 41.\r\n\r\nIt is said, in the second place, that “the new agriculture gave more\r\nemployment to labour than the old.” No doubt such an improvement as the\r\nsubstitution of well-hoed turnips for a fallow, the sowing of grass\r\nseeds with barley so as to produce a second crop, or feed for cattle\r\nafter the barley was carried, both gave increased employment to labour,\r\nand tended to increased prosperity for the labouring as well as other\r\nclasses. But these changes, as we have seen, and as Dr. Cunningham\r\nhimself points out, might take place independently of enclosure, and\r\nmight not follow if enclosure did take place. Whether they usually did\r\nfollow upon enclosure is a question that has to be settled by an appeal\r\nto contemporary evidence. In taking this evidence reference must always\r\nbe carefully made to the _time_ and the _place_.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Agriculture’s General Report on Enclosures (1808) quotes\r\nwith approval an anonymous pamphlet published in 1772: “The advantages\r\nand disadvantages of enclosing waste lands and common fields,” by “A\r\nCountry Gentleman.” This tract appears to be a very able and impartial\r\nattempt to estimate the effects of enclosure on all the classes\r\ninterested. The way in which Acts then originated, and the manner in\r\nwhich proposals were received, is described thus:--\r\n\r\n“The landowner, seeing the great increase of rent made by his\r\nneighbour, conceives a desire of following his example; the village\r\nis alarmed; the great farmer dreads an increase of rent, and being\r\nconstrained to a system of agriculture which neither his experience nor\r\nhis inclination tempt him into; the small farmer, that his farm will\r\nbe taken from him and consolidated with the larger; the cottager not\r\nonly expects to lose his commons, but the inheritable consequence of\r\nthe diminution of labour, the being obliged to quit his native place\r\nin search of work; the inhabitants of the larger towns, a scarcity of\r\nprovisions; and the Kingdom in general, the loss of inhabitants” (p. 1).\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion seems to be that all these anticipations and\r\nfears, with the exception of the last two--a scarcity of provisions for\r\nlarge towns, and a general loss of inhabitants for the kingdom, are\r\nwell founded. With regard to the landowner and tithe-owner:--\r\n\r\n“There can be no dispute that it is the landowners’ interest to promote\r\ninclosures; but I verily believe, the improprietor of tithes reaps\r\nthe greatest proportional benefit, whilst the small freeholder, from\r\nhis expenses increasing inversely to the smallness of his allotment,\r\nundoubtedly receives the least” (p. 25).[43]\r\n\r\n [43] This is badly expressed. He refers to the fact that a small\r\n allotment is more expensive to fence, proportionally to its size, than\r\n a large one.\r\n\r\nOf the small farmer:--“Indeed I doubt it is too true, he must of\r\nnecessity give over farming, and betake himself to labour for the\r\nsupport of his family” (p. 31).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the increase or diminution of employment for labourers,\r\nhe gives the following statistical table, an estimate based on his\r\nobservation:--\r\n\r\n┌───────────────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────┐\r\n│                           │ Before Enclosure │ After Enclosure │\r\n│      1,000 Acres of       │      gives       │      gives      │\r\n│                           │  Employment to   │  Employment to  │\r\n├───────────────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n│ A Rich Arable Land        │   20 families    │    5  families  │\r\n│ B Inferior Arable         │   20    ″        │   16¼    ″      │\r\n│ C Stinted Common Pastures │     ½ a family   │    5     ″      │\r\n│ D Heaths, Wastes, etc.    │     ½     ″      │   16¼    ″      │\r\n└───────────────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────┘\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that his observation is that enclosed arable employs\r\n16¼ families per 1000 acres, open field arable 20 families per 1000\r\nacres; that common pastures, heaths, wastes, etc., employ only 1 family\r\nper 2000 acres; but enclosed pasture employs 5 families per 1000 acres.\r\nIt will also be seen that his observation is that after enclosure rich\r\nland becomes pasture, inferior land arable.[44]\r\n\r\n [44] This is in harmony with all other eighteenth century information\r\n with regard to the Midland Counties. As one example we may cite the\r\n Vale of Belvoir, the north-eastern corner of Leicestershire. Here, in\r\n consequence of enclosure, “all the richest land in the vale, formerly\r\n under tillage, was laid down in grass, but the skirtings of the Vale,\r\n formerly sheep-walk, were brought into tillage.” The landlord, the\r\n Duke of Rutland, forbade any land worth more than a guinea per acre to\r\n be tilled. The enclosure of the twelve parishes in the Vale took place\r\n between 1766 and 1792. (William Pitt, “Agriculture of Leicestershire,”\r\n 1809.)\r\n\r\nWith regard to the effect of this on population, he names in one\r\npassage[45] Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire perhaps,\r\nas containing “an infinitely greater proportion of common fields, while\r\nNorthumberland, Westmoreland and Yorkshire exceed in moors, heaths\r\nand commons,” and in another he mentions Oxfordshire, Buckingham,\r\nNorthamptonshire and part of Leicester as counties in which rich arable\r\nland would be the main subject of an Enclosure Act. A typical parish\r\nin this district might include 1000 acres of rich arable land, 500\r\nacres of inferior arable, 500 acres of stinted common, with no heath or\r\nwaste. Before enclosure it would provide employment for 30¼ labouring\r\nfamilies according to the table, after enclosure to 15⅝. If eight such\r\nparishes were enclosed, 117 families would be sent adrift--families\r\nof poor and ignorant labourers, looking for new homes under all the\r\ndisabilities and difficulties springing from Acts of Settlement, and a\r\nPoor Law administration based on the assumption that those who wander\r\nfrom their native place are all that is implied in the words “vagrants”\r\nand “vagabonds.” Not eight, but a hundred and twenty-six Acts for\r\nenclosing common fields were passed for the four counties he names in\r\nthe ten years 1762–1772, immediately preceding the publication of this\r\npamphlet. Assuming the accuracy of the “Country Gentleman’s” statement,\r\nthis would mean that some 1800 odd families, comprising about 9000\r\nindividuals, would, in consequence of enclosure, be sent adrift in that\r\nshort period in the four counties. The quotations given below from\r\nthree other authors, indicate that even this was an under-statement.\r\nThe process continued without intermission for many years afterwards.\r\n\r\n [45] Page 43.\r\n\r\nA specially interesting tract, published in 1786, entitled “Thoughts\r\non Inclosures, by a Country Farmer,” gives a detailed account of the\r\nresults of one case of enclosure. The locality is not named, but it is\r\npretty clear that it was within this Midland country in which enclosure\r\nwas attended by the conversion of arable to pasture.\r\n\r\nOn the general question the writer says:--“To obtain an Act of\r\nParliament to inclose a common field, two witnesses are produced, to\r\nswear that the lands thereof, in their present state, are not worth\r\noccupying, though at the same time they are lands of the best soil in\r\nthe kingdom, and produce corn in the greatest abundance, and of the\r\nbest quality. And by inclosing such lands, they are generally prevented\r\nfrom producing any corn at all, as the landowner converts twenty small\r\nfarms into about four large ones, and at the same time the tenants\r\nof those large farms are tied down in their leases not to plough any\r\nof the premises, so lett to farm,[46] by which means of several hundred\r\nvillages, that forty years ago contained between four and five hundred\r\ninhabitants, very few will now be found to exceed eighty, and some not\r\nhalf that number; nay some contain only one poor decripid man or woman,\r\nhoused by the occupiers of lands who live in another parish, to prevent\r\nthem being obliged to pay towards the support of the poor who live in\r\nthe next parish” (p. 2).\r\n\r\nThe profit of enclosing, he maintains, was dependent upon simultaneous\r\nconversion into pasture, for “In some places the lands inclosed do\r\nnot answer the ends of pasturage, and in that case tillage is still to\r\nbe pursued; because the rents cannot be raised so high as in respect\r\nof pasturage, therefore the landowner has not the advantage as in case\r\nthe land turns out fit for pasturage, and is oftener the loser by that\r\nproceeding than the gainer.”[46]\r\n\r\n [46] Arthur Young (“Eastern Tour,” 1771, p. 96) remarks that in\r\n Leicestershire “Landlords in general will not allow an inch to be\r\n ploughed on grazing farms.”\r\n\r\nThe particular enclosure he cites is that of a parish enclosed about\r\nforty years previously. Before enclosure it contained eighty-two\r\nhouses, of which twenty were small farms and forty-two were cottages\r\nwith common rights. It had 1800 acres of common field arable, 200\r\nacres of rich common cow pasture, and 200 acres of meadow, commonable\r\nafter hay harvest. The common pasture fed two hundred milch cows and\r\nsixty dry ones till hay harvest, at which time they were turned into\r\nthe meadows, and their place taken by about one hundred horses. Twelve\r\nhundred sheep were fed on the stubbles.\r\n\r\nThe gross produce of the parish before enclosure he values as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                         £   _s. d._\r\n\r\n  1,100 quarters of wheat at 28_s._ per quarter        1,540  0  0\r\n  1,200 quarters of barley at 16_s._ per quarter         960  0  0\r\n  900 quarters of beans at 15_s._ per quarter            675  0  0\r\n  250 todds of wool at 16_s._ per todd                   200  0  0\r\n  600 lambs at 10_s._ each                               300  0  0\r\n  5,000 lbs. of cheese at 1½_d._ per lb.               31  5  0\r\n  6,000 lbs. of butter at 5_d._ per lb.                  125  0  0\r\n  100 calves at 20_s._ each                              100  0  0\r\n  150 pigs at 12_s._ each                                 90  0  0\r\n  Poultry and eggs                                        80  0  0\r\n                                                       ───────────\r\n                                                      £4,101  5  0\r\n                                                       ═══════════\r\n\r\nThe quantities estimated are eminently reasonable, and in harmony with\r\nother statements available with regard to the produce of the common\r\nfields of the Midlands; the prices also are clearly not over-stated.\r\n\r\nAs the result of enclosure the twenty farms were consolidated into\r\nfour, the whole area was devoted to grazing, sixty cottages were pulled\r\ndown or otherwise disappeared, and the necessary work was done by four\r\nherds (one for each farm) at £25 a year each, board included, and eight\r\nmaidservants at £18 a year each, board included.\r\n\r\nThe gross produce of the parish after enclosure was:--\r\n\r\n                             £  _s. d._\r\n  Fat beasts                960  0  0\r\n  Sheep and lambs           760  0  0\r\n  Calves                    165  0  0\r\n  Wool                      235  0  0\r\n  Butter                    190  0  0\r\n  Cheese                    100  0  0\r\n  Horses                    250  0  0\r\n                          ───────────\r\n                         £2,660  0  0\r\n                          ═══════════\r\n\r\nBut while the gross produce was thus reduced by about one-third, the\r\ngross rent was raised from £1137 17_s._ 0_d._ to £1801 12_s._ 2_d._[47]\r\n\r\n [47] According to the “Country Gentleman’s” calculations, the gross\r\n produce of the 1800 acres of common field and 200 acres of common\r\n pasture would be before enclosure £1419 8_s._, and after, £3000,\r\n which agrees very closely with the “Country Farmer’s” statement, the\r\n absolute amounts being greater, the ratio between them practically\r\n identical.\r\n\r\nThough unfortunately the parish is not identified, and the witness\r\nis anonymous, the whole statement appears to have been carefully and\r\nexactly made. In this case we have no fewer than sixty families of\r\nsmall farmers or agricultural labourers expelled from their homes in a\r\nsingle parish of about 2300 acres.\r\n\r\nAn even more striking example of local depopulation caused by enclosure\r\nis supplied by the Rev. John Howlett, one of the strongest advocates of\r\nenclosure. He quotes from a private correspondent: “As to Inclosure,\r\nI can mention two villages in this County (Leicestershire) within two\r\nmiles of each other, Wistow and Foston,[48] which formerly contained\r\nthirty-four or thirty-five dwellings, but by enclosure Foston is\r\nreduced to three habitations: the parsonage house accommodates one\r\nfamily, and the two other buildings are occupied by shepherds, who\r\nmanage the stock for their different renters, as the whole of the\r\nparish belongs to one person. And as to Wistow, the thirty-four\r\nmansions have vanished in a very few years, and no dwelling remains\r\nbut the late Sir Charles Halford’s hall house, who owns the lordship;\r\nand these are called improvements, for double or treble rents ensue.”\r\n(“Enclosures and Depopulation,” p. 12.)\r\n\r\n [48] Each of these was enclosed without an Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhat became of these farmers and labourers? The “Country Farmer” says:\r\n“Many of the small farmers who have been deprived of their livelihood\r\nhave sold their stock-in-trade and have raised from £50 to £100, with\r\nwhich they have procured themselves, their families, and money, a\r\npassage to America.”\r\n\r\nJohn Wedge, the Board of Agriculture reporter for Warwick, says seven\r\nyears later: “About forty years ago the southern and eastern parts of\r\nthis county consisted mostly of open fields. There are still about\r\n50,000 acres of open field land, which in a few years will probably\r\nall be inclosed.... These lands being now grazed want much fewer\r\nhands to manage them than they did in the former open state. Upon all\r\nenclosures of open fields the farms have generally been made much\r\nlarger; from these causes the hardy yeomanry of country villages\r\nhave been driven for employment to Birmingham, Coventry, and other\r\nmanufacturing towns.”[49] Such information, given by the representative\r\nof an enclosure-advocating corporation, circulated among the members\r\nfor correction before final adoption, is unimpeachable evidence for the\r\nparticular time and place.\r\n\r\n [49] John Wedge, “Warwickshire” p. 40 (1793).\r\n\r\nThe rising industries of Birmingham and other Midland towns found\r\nemployment, no doubt, for many of the exiles from the villages. On\r\nthe whole, the ruling opinion seems to have found all this very\r\nsatisfactory. The gross produce of food by these Midland parishes\r\nmight be diminished on enclosure, but the net produce, as was shown\r\nby the increase of rent, certainly increased, and an abundant supply\r\nof labour was furnished for those metal working industries which were\r\nof the greatest importance in times of war.[50] When we think of the\r\nhorrible sanitary conditions of English towns during the eighteenth\r\ncentury, of Fielding’s description of the London lodging-houses, of\r\nColquhoun’s attempts at a statistical account of London thieves, of\r\nHogarth’s pictures, which interpret for us the meaning of the terrible\r\nfact that right through the eighteenth century the deaths “within the\r\nbills of mortality” regularly far exceeded the births, we feel that\r\nthere was another side to the shield, though possibly the sanitary and\r\nsocial condition of Midland towns was less terrible than that of London.\r\n\r\n [50] 1756–1763, 1775–1784, 1792–1815 were times of war.\r\n\r\nThe connection between enclosure of common fields and rising poor\r\nrates in the eighteenth century is illustrated repeatedly in Eden’s\r\n“Condition of the Poor.”\r\n\r\nIn Buckinghamshire we find the two neighbouring parishes of Maids\r\nMorton and Winslow. The former contained 30 acres of old enclosure, 60\r\nto 70 acres of commons, and the rest of the parish, about 800 acres,\r\nwas common field. The poor-rates in the years 1792 to 1795 were 3_s._\r\n6_d._, 3_s._, 3_s._, 3_s._ 6_d._ There were “several roundsmen.” Wages\r\nwere nominally 1_s._ to 1_s._ 2_d._ per day, but piecework was general,\r\nand 1_s._ 3_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ was generally earned. The rent of farms\r\nvaried from £17 to £90 per farm, and from 18_s._ to 20_s._ per acre.\r\n\r\nWinslow contained 1400 acres, and was entirely enclosed in 1744 and\r\n1766. Only 200 acres remained arable. The farms varied from £60 to\r\n£400 per annum each, the wages were 6_s._ to 7_s._ per week, “most of\r\nthe labourers are on rounds,” and the poor rates from 1792 to 1795\r\nwere 5_s._ 8_d._, 4_s._, 5_s._, and 6_s._ “The rise of the Rates is\r\nchiefly ascribed to the Enclosure of common fields; which it is said\r\nhas lessened the number of farms, and from the conversion of arable\r\ninto pasture, has much reduced the demand for labourers. An old man of\r\nthe parish says, before the enclosures took place, land did not let for\r\n10_s._ per acre.” (Vol. II., pp. 27–33.)\r\n\r\nIn judging the rise of poor rate, it must not be forgotten that where\r\nthe rent rises at the same time as the nominal rate, the sum of money\r\nactually raised for Poor Law purposes is increased in a greater ratio\r\nthan the nominal poor rate. If, for example, by enclosure the rental\r\nof a parish is increased 50 per cent., but the poor rate doubled, the\r\nyield of the poor rate is increased threefold. And if a considerable\r\nnumber of labourers are driven elsewhere, the amount of destitution\r\nproduced by the change is far greater even than that indicated by a\r\nthreefold increase in the amount of relief given.\r\n\r\nThe latter side of the process is illustrated in the case of Deddington\r\nin Oxfordshire. Here, “the high rates in this parish are ascribed to\r\nthe common field of which the land principally consists; whereas the\r\nneighbouring parishes have been enclosed many years, and many small\r\nfarms in them have been consolidated; so that many small farmers\r\nwith little capitals have been obliged, either to turn labourers or\r\nto procure small farms in Deddington, or other parishes that possess\r\ncommon fields. Besides this, the neighbouring parishes are, many of\r\nthem, possessed by a few individuals, who are cautious in permitting\r\nnew comers to obtain a settlement.” (Vol. II., p. 891.)\r\n\r\nIn Leicestershire the complaint is naturally more loud and general. In\r\nthe account of Kibworth Beauchamp we read as follows:--\r\n\r\n“No account of the Rates in any of the divisions, previous to the\r\nenclosure of the common fields, can be obtained; but it is said that\r\nthey were not one-third of what they are at present; and the people\r\nattribute the rise to the enclosures; for they say ‘That before the\r\nfields were enclosed, they were solely applied to the production of\r\ncorn; that the poor had then plenty of employment in weeding, reaping,\r\nthreshing, etc., and could also collect a great quantity of corn by\r\ngleaning; but that the fields being now in pasturage, the farmers have\r\nlittle occasion for labourers, and the poor being thereby thrown out\r\nof employment, must of course be employed by the parish.’ There is\r\nsome truth in these observations: _one-third or perhaps one-fourth_ of\r\nthe number of hands which were required twenty years ago, would now be\r\nsufficient, according to the present system of agriculture, to perform\r\nall the farming work of the parish.”\r\n\r\nHe adds that if it were not for the fact that many labourers were\r\ngetting employment in canal cutting, the rates would be much higher\r\nstill, and “the tradesmen, small farmers, and labourers are very loud\r\nin their complaints against those whom they call monopolising farmers\r\nand graziers, an evil which, they say, increases every year.” (Vol.\r\nII., p. 383.)\r\n\r\nIn Northamptonshire we find the case of Brixworth, enclosed in 1780,\r\na parish of 3300 acres. Before enclosure it consisted almost entirely\r\nof common fields. At the time of Eden’s writing, sixteen years\r\nlater, only one-third remained arable. The expenditure on the poor\r\nin 1776, before the enclosure, was £121 6_s._, in the six years 1787\r\nto 1792 it averaged £325 (Vol. II., p. 529). Again, with regard to local\r\nurban opinion, he notes that “the lands round Kettering are chiefly\r\nopen field: they produce rich crops of corn. The people of the town\r\nseem averse to enclosures, which they think will raise the price\r\nof provisions, from these lands being all turned to pasture, when\r\ninclosed, as was the case in Leicestershire, which was a great corn\r\ncountry, and is now, almost entirely, converted into pasture.”\r\n\r\nArthur Young, a little more than twenty years previously (in “Political\r\nArithmetic,” published in 1774), while arguing in favour of enclosure\r\non the depopulation count, makes an admission against it with regard\r\nto pauperism. “Very many of the labouring poor have become chargeable\r\nto their parishes, but this has nothing to do with depopulation; on\r\nthe contrary, the constantly seeing such vast sums distributed in this\r\nway, must be an inducement to marriage among all the idle poor--and\r\ncertainly has proved so.” (Pp. 75, 76.)\r\n\r\nAs a general rule it may be said that where after enclosure pasturage\r\nwas increased at the expense of tillage, rural depopulation resulted;\r\nwhere the amount of land under tillage was increased the rural\r\npopulation increased. Further, that enclosure in the northern and\r\nwestern parts of England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\r\nincreased the area under tillage; that the balance between the\r\nproduction of bread and meat for the whole country, so disturbed, was\r\nmaintained by the conversion into pasture, on enclosure, of much of the\r\n“champion” corn growing land, particularly in those midland counties\r\nnearest to the northern and western ones in which the complementary\r\nchange was taking place. By means of the Enclosure Acts, interpreted by\r\nthe light of the above statements, we can trace these two compensating\r\nmovements through the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe following passage in Arthur Young’s “Political Arithmetic,”\r\npublished in 1774, at the time, that is, when he was an eager advocate\r\nnot only of enclosure of all sorts, but also of the engrossing of farms\r\nand the raising of rents, sums up the two movements:--\r\n\r\n“The fact is this: in the central counties of the kingdom,\r\nparticularly Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, and parts of Warwick,\r\nHuntingdonshire, and Buckinghamshire, there have been within thirty\r\nyears large tracts of the open field arable under that vile course,\r\n1. fallow, 2. wheat, 3. spring corn, inclosed and laid down to grass,\r\nbeing much more suited to the wetness of the soil than corn.” Here\r\nhe admits local depopulation takes place, though he claims that a\r\ngreater _net_ produce is, as the result of enclosure, supplied by\r\nsuch districts to the rest of the kingdom. But then, he asks with\r\nregard to the opponents of such enclosure, “What will they say to the\r\ninclosures in _Norfolk_, _Suffolk_, _Nottinghamshire_, _Derbyshire_,\r\n_Lincolnshire_, _Yorkshire_ and all the northern counties? What say\r\nthey to the sands of _Norfolk, Suffolk and Nottinghamshire_, which\r\nyield corn and mutton from _the force of INCLOSURE alone_? What say\r\nthey to the Wolds of _York_ and _Lincoln_, which from barren heaths at\r\n1_s._ per acre, are _by INCLOSURE alone_ rendered profitable farms?\r\nAsk _Sir Cecil Wray_ if without Inclosure he could advance his heaths\r\nby sainfoine from 1_s._ to 20_s._ an acre:--What say they to the vast\r\ntracts in the peak of Derby which _by INCLOSURE alone_ are changed\r\nfrom black regions of ling to fertile fields covered with cattle? What\r\nsay they to the improvements of moors in the northern counties, where\r\nINCLOSURES alone have made these countries smile with culture which\r\nbefore were black as night?”\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to ridicule the view of his opponents, that the\r\nenclosure of waste, though desirable in itself, should as far as\r\npossible be so conducted as to create small farms and small properties,\r\na view with which in later years, and after his tour in France, he very\r\nmuch sympathised. Into the merits of this controversy we need not go;\r\nwhat we have to note here is Arthur Young’s evidence to the fact that\r\nfrom about 1744 to 1774 there was simultaneously proceeding a rapid\r\nenclosure of waste in Norfolk, Suffolk, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire,\r\nYorkshire, and Lincolnshire and the northern counties, by which\r\nthe acreage under tillage was vastly increased, and a compensating\r\nenclosure of arable common fields in Northamptonshire, Leicestershire,\r\nWarwickshire, Huntingdonshire and Buckinghamshire, involving the\r\nconversion of arable to pasture, of small farms into much larger ones,\r\nand of the peasantry into urban labourers.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to be added that the former movement, if it was on\r\nat all as great a scale as Arthur Young gives us to understand (and\r\nI don’t see why one should doubt this) must have proceeded largely,\r\nif not mainly, without the intervention of Parliament. This is in the\r\nfirst place antecedently probable. Secondly, whereas between 1727\r\nand 1774 there were 273 common field parishes enclosed by Acts of\r\nParliament in the five counties of Northamptonshire, Leicestershire,\r\nWarwick, Huntingdonshire and Buckinghamshire, the commons, fens,\r\nmoors, etc., attached to only 109 parishes in Norfolk, Suffolk,\r\nNottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Durham and\r\nNorthumberland were so enclosed. Unless the area of about 100,000 acres\r\nthus enclosed in these 109 parishes was merely a fraction of the total\r\narea of waste enclosed by all sorts of methods in this latter group of\r\ncounties, Arthur Young was misleading his readers, for he certainly\r\nintends to give the impression that the enclosure of arable fields\r\nin the Midlands was on a much smaller scale than the reclamation of\r\nheaths, moors and fens in the northern and eastern counties. Thirdly,\r\nwith regard to Norfolk, Arthur Young specifies enclosure without\r\nActs of Parliament as one of the causes of the great agricultural\r\nimprovement in parts of Norfolk (“Eastern Tour,” 1771, Vol. II., p.\r\n150):--“From forty to sixty years ago, all the Northern and Western and\r\na great part of the Eastern tracts of the country were sheep-walks, let\r\nso low as from 6_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ and 2_s._ an acre. Much of it was\r\nin this condition only thirty years ago. The great improvements have\r\nbeen made by reason of the following circumstances:--(1) By inclosing\r\nwithout assistance of Parliament.”\r\n\r\nSix other reasons follow, then the remark: “Parliamentary enclosures\r\nare scarcely ever so complete and general as in Norfolk,” _i.e._, as\r\nthe enclosures without the assistance of Parliament in Norfolk. I have\r\nonly been able to find eleven Acts of Enclosure for Norfolk before\r\n1771; seven of these were for the enclosure of common field parishes,\r\nand four for the enclosure of waste. In other words, the Parliamentary\r\nenclosure of these sheep-walks at the time when Arthur Young wrote had\r\nproceeded to a merely trifling extent.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, by Arthur Young’s confession, in the five counties of\r\nNorthampton, Leicester, Warwick, Huntingdon, and Buckingham enclosure\r\nadmittedly accompanied by decay of tillage and rural depopulation.\r\nFrom “A Country Gentleman’s” list we can add Oxfordshire and parts of\r\nLincolnshire. That the same prevailing economic motive operated in\r\nBedfordshire can be shown from Arthur Young’s “Tour through the North\r\nof England.” The country in June, 1768, from St. Neots to Kimbolton\r\nwas in general open--“the open fields let at 7_s._ and 7_s._ 6_d._ per\r\nacre, and the _inclosed pastures_ about 17_s._ Hence we find a profit\r\nof 10_s._ an acre _by inclosing and laying to grass_.” He might here\r\nask, as he does with regard to the district in Buckinghamshire between\r\nAylesbury and Buckingham, which he found in 1771 in the condition of\r\nopen field arable, under a course of fallow, wheat, beans, fallow,\r\nbarley, beans. “As to the landlords, what in the name of wonder can\r\nbe the reason of their not inclosing! All this vale would make as fine\r\nmeadows as any in the world.”\r\n\r\nAs for Gloucestershire, William Marshall (“Rural Economy of\r\nGloucestershire,” 1789, p. 21), estimates the rents in the Vale of\r\nEvesham at 10_s._ to 15_s._ per acre for common field arable, 10_s._\r\nto 20_s._ per acre for enclosed arable, and 20_s._ to 50_s._ per acre\r\nfor enclosed pasture. Here again there can be no doubt that enclosure\r\nimplied laying down at least all the good land in grass.\r\n\r\nA Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to consider the\r\nhigh prices of food in December, 1800 (1800 and 1801 being famine\r\nyears), made enquiry, by the help of the parish clergy, into the\r\nincrease or decrease of land under different crops, and of cattle,\r\nsheep, and pigs in the districts which had been enclosed in the\r\nprevious 45 years by private Acts (_i.e._, since 1755). The total\r\nresult showed a net gain in area under wheat in 1,767,651 acres\r\nenclosed of 10,625 acres; the area under wheat being before enclosure\r\n155,572 acres; after, 165,837 acres. But these figures included all\r\nsorts of enclosure. The Board of Agriculture (“Gen. Report,” pp. 39 and\r\n232), by leaving out cases where waste only was enclosed, obtained the\r\nfollowing result for cases of enclosure of all commonable lands, under\r\nActs passed between 1761 and 1799, in parishes where commonable arable\r\nwas included.

borne\r\nin mind that the figures for acreage in wheat after enclosure were\r\ncollected at a time of famine prices for wheat. Probably many thousands\r\nof acres of old arable common field, which had been enclosed and laid\r\ndown in grass, in each of these counties, were again ploughed under the\r\nstimulus of wheat prices exceeding 100_s._ per quarter.\r\n\r\nSo much with regard to the connexion between depopulation and enclosure\r\nin the second half of the eighteenth century. With regard to the first\r\nhalf, the following account is supplied by a certain John Cowper,\r\n“Inclosing Commons and Common field lands is contrary to the interest\r\nof the Nation” (1732):--\r\n\r\n“When these commons come to be inclosed and converted into pasture, the\r\nRuin of the Poor is a natural consequence; they being bought out by the\r\nlord of the _Manor_, or some other person of substance.\r\n\r\n“In most open field parishes there are at a medium 40 farmers and 80\r\ncottagers who hold their lands in common, and have right of commonage\r\none with another. Suppose each person employs 6 labourers, we have in\r\nall 660 persons, men, women and children, who besides their Employment\r\nin Husbandry, carry on large branches of the Woollen and Linnen\r\nManufactures.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to the plea that hedging and ditching will employ many\r\nhands, he says: “This is so contrary to constant experience, that it\r\nhardly deserves to be taken notice of. I myself, within these 30 years\r\npast, have seen above 20 Lordships or Parishes inclosed, and everyone\r\nof them has been in a manner depopulated. If we take all the inclosed\r\nParishes one with another, we shall find hardly ten inhabitants\r\nremaining, where there were an hundred before Inclosures were made.\r\nAnd in some parishes 120 families of Farmers and Cottagers, have in a\r\nfew years been reduced to four, to two, aye, and sometimes to but one\r\nfamily. And if this practice of inclosing continues much longer, we may\r\nexpect to see all the great estates ingrossed by a few Hands, and the\r\nindustrious Farmers and Cottagers almost intirely rooted out of the\r\nkingdom. Raising Hedges and sinking ditches may indeed employ several\r\nhands for a year, or hardly so long, but when that is once over, the\r\nwork is at an end.... Owners of inclosed Lands, if they have but a\r\nlittle corn to get in, are already forced to send several miles to open\r\nfield parishes for Harvest men.”\r\n\r\nSix open field farms, averaging 150 acres each, and the little holdings\r\nof twelve cottagers, would be let together, after enclosure, as one\r\ngrazing farm, and the total rent thus be raised from £300 to £600.\r\nBut whereas one acre of arable land would previously have produced 20\r\nbushels at 3_s._ per bushel, a gross return of £3; after enclosure it\r\nwould contribute to the fattening of a bullock to the extent of 25_s._\r\nThe gross produce is decreased; but the net produce is increased. Of\r\nthe £3 produced by the acre of common field under wheat, 50_s._ would\r\ngo in expenses, leaving 6_s._ 8_d._ to the landlord and 3_s._ 4_d._\r\nto the tenant. Of the 25_s._ produced by the same acre enclosed under\r\ngrass, 13_s._ 4_d._ would go to the landlord, 11_s._ 8_d._ to the\r\ngrazier.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting in passing to note the association of common field\r\nagriculture with manufacture in the domestic stage indicated by this\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nWe have also direct evidence of the same movements in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. On the one hand Walter Blyth (“The English Improver,” 1649,\r\np. 40) has the passage:--“Consider but the Woodlands, who before\r\nEnclosure, were wont to be relieved by the Fieldon, with corne of all\r\nsorts. And now growne as gallant Corne Countries as be in England,\r\nas the Western part of Warwickshire, and the northern parts of\r\nWorcestershire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and\r\nall the countries thereabouts.” On the other hand, from the controversy\r\nbetween the two John Moores on the one hand, and Joseph Lee and an\r\nanonymous controversialist on the other, we can pick out certain\r\nstatements of matters of fact that passed uncontradicted.\r\n\r\nThis controversy arose out of the enclosure of Catthorp, a parish\r\nin the extreme south-west corner of Leicestershire, bordering on\r\nNorthamptonshire and Warwickshire. Lee was the parish priest of\r\nCatthorp, and a party to the enclosure. In his “Vindication of\r\nRegulated Inclosure,” he gives a list of fifteen parishes within three\r\nmiles of Catthorp which had been enclosed. He also gives a list of\r\nnineteen parishes, enclosed from twenty to fifty years, in which\r\ndepopulation had not yet taken place. This second list, as John Moore\r\nremarks, “they were forced to fish up out of the counties of Leicester,\r\nWarwick, Northampton, etc.,” and it is significant that two only of\r\nthe fifteen parishes enclosed near Catthorp are asserted by Lee not to\r\nhave been attended by depopulation. If we go a little earlier we find\r\nin 1607 an insurrection against enclosures, followed by a searching\r\nenquiry by James I.’s government, and no doubt by renewed vigilance,\r\nfor a while, in the enforcement of the Depopulation Acts. It may be\r\nregarded as axiomatic that in a corn-growing country,[51] enclosure\r\nwhich does not diminish tillage, does not provoke riot and insurrection.\r\n\r\n [51] Riots may occur on the enclosure of waste, where the enclosed\r\n waste gave a livelihood to a considerable specialised population,\r\n as in Hatfield Chase and the Fens. See Dr. Cunningham’s “Growth of\r\n English Industry and Commerce,” Vol. II., pp. 187, 188.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, enclosure which does not diminish the land under\r\ntillage does not, as a rule, cause rural depopulation, it is a rule\r\nnot altogether without exception. One of the most striking passages in\r\nCobbett’s “Rural Rides” is that written in August, 1826, in which he\r\ndescribes the valley of the Wiltshire Avon:--\r\n\r\n“It is manifest enough, that the population of this valley was, at\r\none time, many times over what it is now; for, in the first place,\r\nwhat were the twenty-nine churches built for? The population of the\r\ntwenty-nine parishes is now but little more than one-half of the\r\nsingle parish of Kensington,[52] and there are several of the churches\r\nbigger than the church at Kensington.... In three instances, Fifield,\r\nMilston, and Roach-Fen, the _church porches_ would hold all the\r\ninhabitants, even down to the bedridden and the babies. What then,\r\nwill any man believe that these churches were built for such little\r\nknots of people?... But, in fact, you plainly see all the traces of\r\na great ancient population. The churches were almost all large, and\r\nbuilt in the best manner. Many of them are very fine edifices; very\r\ncostly in the building; and, in the cases where the body of the church\r\nhas been altered in the repairing of it, so as to make it smaller, the\r\ntower, which everywhere defies the hostility of time, shows you what\r\nthe church must formerly have been.... There are now no less than nine\r\nof the parishes out of the twenty-nine, that have either no parsonage\r\nhouses or have such as are in such a state that a parson will not,\r\nor cannot, live in them.... The land remains, and the crops and the\r\nsheep come as abundantly as ever; but they are now sent almost wholly\r\naway.... In the distance of about thirty miles, there stood fifty\r\nmansion houses. Where are they now? I believe there are but eight,\r\nthat are at all worthy of the name of mansion houses.... In taking my\r\nleave of this beautiful vale I have to express my deep shame, as an\r\nEnglishman, at beholding the general extreme poverty of those who cause\r\nthis vale to produce such quantities of food and raiment. This is, I\r\nverily believe it, the worst-used labouring population upon the face of\r\nthe earth.”[53]\r\n\r\n [52] Just above he states it at 9,116.\r\n\r\n [53] “Rural Rides,” 1830 edition, pp. 375–390.\r\n\r\nWhen Cobbett wrote, the process of Enclosure for this corner of\r\nWiltshire was practically complete. Thomas Davis, whose account of the\r\nagriculture of Wiltshire is the most interesting of the whole series\r\nof county surveys, wrote when the process was in its early stage, and\r\nwrote predicting depopulation. He says, “The greater part of this\r\ncountry was formerly, and at no very remote period, in the hands of\r\ngreat proprietors. Almost every manor had its resident lord, who held\r\npart of the lands in demesne, and granted out the rest by copy or\r\nlease to under tenants, usually for three lives renewable. A state of\r\ncommonage, and particularly of open common fields, was particularly\r\nfavourable to this tenure.... The north-west of Wiltshire being much\r\nbetter adapted to inclosures and to sub-division of property, than the\r\nrest, was inclosed first; while the south-east, or Down district, has\r\nundergone few inclosures and still fewer sub-divisions.”[54]\r\n\r\n [54] Thos. Davis, Wiltshire, p. 8.\r\n\r\nThe common field system was called “tenantry.”[55] The tenants\r\nordinarily were occupiers of single “yardlands,” rented at about £20\r\na year each. A typical yardland consisted,[56] besides the homestead,\r\nof 2 acres of meadow, 18 acres in the arable fields, usually in 18 to\r\n20 pieces, a right on the common meadows, common fields, and downs\r\nfor forty sheep, and as many cattle as the tenant could winter with\r\nthe fodder he grew.[57] His forty sheep were kept with those of his\r\nneighbours, in the common flock of the manor, in charge of the common\r\nshepherd. They were taken every day to the downs, and brought back\r\nevery night to be folded on the arable fields, the usual rule being\r\nto fold one thousand sheep on a “tenantry” acre (but ¾ of a statute\r\nacre) per night. In breeding sheep regard was had to what may be termed\r\nfolding quality (_i.e._, the propensity to drop manure only after being\r\nfolded at night) as much as to quality or quantity of wool or meat.[58]\r\n\r\n [55] _Ibid._, p. 14.\r\n\r\n [56] Contrast with such farms those described by Cobbett 30 years\r\n later: “At one farm 27 ricks, at another 400 acres of wheat stubble in\r\n one piece, at a third a sheepfold about 4,000 sheep and lambs, at a\r\n fourth 300 hogs in one stubble, a fifth farm at Milton had 600 qrs. of\r\n wheat, 1,200 qrs. of barley of the year’s crop, and kept on an average\r\n 1,400 sheep” (pp. 363, 4, 5). “The farms are all large” (p. 361).\r\n\r\n [57] _Ibid._, p. 15.\r\n\r\n [58] _Ibid._, p. 61.\r\n\r\nOn the enclosure of such a manor the common flock was broken up, and\r\nthe position of the small farmer became untenable. It is true, says our\r\nauthor, that he has the convenience of having his arable land in fewer\r\npieces; but if he has his 18 acres all in one piece instead of in 20,\r\nhe cannot plough them with fewer than the three horses he previously\r\nploughed with. Then he has no enclosure to put his horses in; he no\r\nlonger has the common to turn them on. His right on the down would\r\nentitle him to an allotment of sheepdown of about 20 acres, perhaps\r\ntwo miles from home. This is too small for him to be able to take it\r\nup, so he accepts instead an increase of arable land. But now he has\r\nno down on which to feed his sheep, no common shepherd to take charge\r\nof his sheep, which are too few to enable him individually to employ a\r\nshepherd. He, therefore, must part with his flock and then has no sheep\r\nto manure his land; further, having no cow-common, and very little\r\npasture land, he cannot keep cows to make dung with his straw. Lastly,\r\nthe arable land being in general entirely unsuited to turn to grass,\r\nhe is prevented from enclosing his allotment, and laying it down in\r\npasture.[59] Obviously in such circumstances the small farmer, after\r\nfor a few years raising diminishing crops from his impoverished arable\r\nland, must succumb, and in some cases help as a labourer to till his\r\nfields for another man, in other cases drift to the towns or enlist.\r\n\r\n [59] _Ibid._, p. 80.\r\n\r\nThe contemporaneous decay of rural manufacturing industry,[60] of\r\ncourse, greatly aggravated the depopulating effects of enclosure. It\r\nmay even have precipitated enclosure by weakening the position of the\r\nsmall farmer during the period of the French wars: during a time,\r\nthat is, in which a combination of causes, apart from enclosure,\r\nwas favouring the extension of large farms at the expense of small\r\nfarms.[61]\r\n\r\n [60] “The villages down this Valley of Avon, and indeed, it was\r\n the same in almost every part of this county, and in the North and\r\n West of Hampshire also, used to have great employment for the women\r\n and children in the carding and spinning of wool for the making of\r\n broadcloth. This was a very general employment for the women and\r\n girls, but it is now wholly gone.” (Cobbett, “Rural Rides,” p. 385,\r\n 1830 edition, written August, 1826.)\r\n\r\n [61] These causes were (_a_) the great fluctuations in prices of\r\n agricultural produce; (_b_) the custom of using poor relief as a\r\n supplement to agricultural wages. The way in which these operated is\r\n ably dealt with by Dr. Cunningham.\r\n\r\nIn the south-east of Wiltshire, then, enclosure was followed by no\r\nincrease of pasture farming, but it was followed by local depopulation.\r\nWhether the depopulation was merely local, or national as well, would\r\ndepend upon whether, after enclosure, the total production of food of\r\nthe parish were increased or diminished. Thomas Davis tells us that in\r\nmany cases it was diminished, the reason, no doubt, being that there\r\nwas a lack of farmers with sufficient enterprise and control of capital\r\nto absorb the small farms, as their occupiers began to drift towards\r\nbankruptcy. That such a result as this was felt to be an impending\r\ndanger is shown by his statement:--“In some late inclosures allotments\r\nof arable land to small farmers have been set out adjoining to each\r\nother, directing the same to remain in an uninclosed state with a\r\ncommon right of sheep-feed over the whole, and a common allotment of\r\ndown land and another of water-meadows, and some inclosed pasture to\r\neach if necessary.”\r\n\r\nIn this district, consisting of open downs, stretching for miles\r\nalong the summits and higher slopes of the chalk hills; intersected\r\nby winding rivers bordered by flat alluvial land of naturally rich\r\npasture, but converted by irrigation into the famous Wiltshire water\r\nmeadows, the long lower slopes of the hills, as it were, decreed by\r\nnature to be noble corn fields, cultivation had to be on a large scale;\r\nthe unit of cultivation had to be a piece of land of reasonable width,\r\nstretching from the river to the summit of the downs. Hence small farms\r\ncould not exist without some degree of organised mutual help. When that\r\norganisation, which in this district was furnished by the common field\r\nsystem, was terminated by Enclosure Acts, consolidation of farms became\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nNowhere else are these conditions present in quite so fully developed\r\na degree as in Wiltshire, which contains the central hub from which\r\nradiate the three great belts of chalk down, the South Downs, the North\r\nDowns, and the range containing the Chilterns, the chalk hills of\r\nHertfordshire, the Gog-Magogs of Cambridgeshire, and their continuation\r\ninto Norfolk. But the most essential feature of Wiltshire agriculture,\r\nviz., the combination of sheep down and arable field, may be said to\r\nbe characteristic of all this country. This is the country from which\r\nin the sixteenth century came the great indignant outcry against\r\nenclosure, which in More’s “Utopia” enters into the classic literature\r\nof our country. When it is remembered that the economic motive of\r\nenclosure then was the high price of wool, that private individuals\r\nare stated to have owned flocks of ten thousand, twenty thousand, and\r\neven of twenty-four thousand sheep[62], it is easy to conceive of whole\r\nparishes being converted into great sheep runs.\r\n\r\n [62] Preamble to 25 Henry VIII. c. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nENCLOSURE AND THE POOR.\r\n\r\n    “The Poor at Enclosure do Grutch\r\n        Because of abuses that fall.”\r\n\r\n    TUSSER, “Champion and Several.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century the controversy with regard to enclosure\r\ndid not turn upon the question whether it did or did not injure\r\nthe mass of the rural poor of the locality, in their capacity of\r\nagricultural labourers, by depriving them of employment; but whether\r\nit injured them by depriving them without compensation of rights which\r\nthey had enjoyed before enclosure, but which could not be legally\r\nestablished; and whether poor owners of common rights have received\r\ncompensation: the question, in fact, whether the poor are justified\r\nin “Grutching at Enclosure,” because of real abuses in the method of\r\ncarrying it out. On this question no distinction need be drawn between\r\nthe two classes of Enclosure Acts.\r\n\r\nI do not think that much complaint can be made with regard to the\r\nadministration of the Enclosure Acts since 1876 by the Board of\r\nAgriculture. By the provision of adequate allotment grounds and\r\nrecreation grounds compensation is made to those villagers who can\r\nclaim no specific rights of common; and though no doubt many of the\r\nowners of single common rights are dissatisfied with the plots of land\r\nassigned to them, there seems to be no reason for doubting that the\r\nCommissioners appointed have endeavoured to deal with rich and poor\r\nwith equal fairness. Further, a great deal of the work of the Board\r\nin its capacity of Enclosure Commissioners has been the regulation of\r\ncommons; and to a certain degree they have become a body for preserving\r\ninstead of destroying commons. They may even be described as the most\r\npotent force for the preservation of existing common-fields, simply by\r\ninsisting on a certain method in the division and allotment, which may\r\nbe too expensive.\r\n\r\nBut this verdict of “Not guilty” only applies to the enclosure\r\nauthority since it was chastened and corrected by the movement for\r\nthe preservation of commons. All the early reports of the Enclosure\r\nCommissioners, or the Enclosure, Tithe and Copyhold Commissioners\r\ngive abundant evidence of the hard, legal spirit in which the\r\nclaims of cottagers were considered, and the slight reasons which\r\nwere considered good enough for refusing recreation grounds and\r\nallotments. The twenty-seventh annual report--the _apologia_ of the\r\nCommissioners--pleads, as we have seen above, that 8,000,000 acres of\r\ncommons, and 1,000,000 acres of commonable arable fields or meadows\r\nstill existed, which was absurdly inaccurate, and that “of all modes\r\nof tenure in a fully peopled country there is none more prejudicial\r\nto improved culture than that of holding in common.” Again, the\r\nthirty-second report makes a great deal of the fact that the 590,000\r\nacres of common and commonable land dealt with since the Act of 1845\r\nhad been distributed among 26,000 separate owners; which, however,\r\nonly proved that the number of people who owned rights over unenclosed\r\nland had been greater than the number of owners of a corresponding\r\narea of enclosed land--but whether that was because commons and common\r\nfields favoured the creation or preservation of small properties (as\r\nit certainly does in many cases), or whether because a multiplicity of\r\nowners favours the preservation of commons and common fields (which is\r\nalways the case), no credit was due to the General Enclosure Act, or to\r\nthe body administering it.\r\n\r\nWe find that between 1845 and 1875, out of a total area of 590,000\r\nacres divided and allotted, just 1758 acres were set aside for\r\nrecreation grounds, and 2195 acres for field gardens and allotments.\r\nThe administration of the Act since 1877 is, therefore, a very severe\r\ncondemnation of its administration in the earlier period.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the case of Ewelme and the neighbouring parishes, how\r\nthe cottagers were injured on enclosure, by losing their source of\r\nfuel, without getting any compensation. I am indebted to Mr. John Swain\r\nfor the following description of the effects of enclosure of a Welsh\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n“The parish of ----, in the county of Montgomeryshire, is about five\r\nmiles long by two miles broad. It consists for the most part of a hill,\r\nlying between a river and one of its tributaries. The hill rises to\r\nabout 900 feet above sea level, and contains no unenclosed land. We\r\nhave, therefore, in this parish, two strips of low-lying meadow land,\r\nland of a moderate quality on the hill slopes, and rough pasture land\r\nnear the summit. On this hill most of the cottage holdings are to be\r\nfound, usually in some sheltered hollow near a spring or a running\r\nstream....\r\n\r\n“Previous to the Enclosure Act, passed early in the nineteenth century,\r\nthe greater part of the hill was open. The farms occupied the bottom\r\nlands, and the foot of the hill, up which they crept, their boundary\r\nfences forming an irregular line on the hillside, being higher or lower\r\nas the nature and quality of the land tempted enclosure. The unenclosed\r\nportion of the hill was used as a common pasture by all the farmers\r\nwhose land adjoined it, and the amount of stock each one was allowed to\r\nfeed on it was roughly regulated by the size of his holding.\r\n\r\n“About 120 years ago a number of the poorer peasantry began settling on\r\nthis common land. There was a general understanding that if a house was\r\nraised during the night so that the builders were able to cause smoke\r\nto issue from the chimney by sunrise, they thereby established a right\r\nof possession which none could gainsay. Timber in the neighbouring\r\nwoods was abundant and cheap, so an intending squatter had little\r\ndifficulty in procuring the material for building his cottage. With the\r\nhelp of his friends he procured sufficient wood for the framework, and\r\nthen selected a convenient site in a sheltered spot with a southern\r\naspect, and marked down the foundations of his future dwelling. When\r\nall preparations were made he gathered together all the help he could,\r\nand in the dusk of the evening had all his materials conveyed to the\r\nselected spot. Rough stonework was laid to form the foundations and\r\nchimney end of the cottage, and then the framework was quickly set\r\nup. The panels were interwoven with stout laths, and covered with\r\nclay, over which was smeared a coating of lime-plaster, while a roof of\r\nthatch completed the edifice. Windows were not for a time considered\r\nnecessary, but the entrance was carefully secured by a stout door. Then\r\njust as the dawn was breaking, a fire was kindled on the hearth, and\r\nthe curl of smoke above the rude chimney told the workers that they\r\ncould now relax their efforts....\r\n\r\n“A dwelling-house having been erected, the next step was to appropriate\r\na few acres of land surrounding it.... The difficulty of obtaining\r\nsufficient land for the keep of a cow was no more than the labour of\r\nenclosing and reclaiming it.\r\n\r\n“In this way some thirty or forty families were settled in cottages\r\nbuilt by themselves, around which were three or four fields, where for\r\nmany years they lived in undisturbed possession. By patient labour the\r\ngorse and fern were got rid of, trees were planted round the cottage,\r\nor allowed to grow where they sprang up in suitable places in the\r\nhedgerows; by cultivation and manuring the herbage was improved.\r\n\r\n“With the Enclosure Act there came a disturbance of this state of\r\naffairs. The partition of the unappropriated land seems to have been\r\ncarried out fairly, by adding to each farm a quantity of land in\r\nproportion to the amount of pasturage the occupier enjoyed on the\r\ncommon.... When, however, we come to consider the case of the cottager,\r\nhis treatment was by no means fair. Enclosures of over twenty-one\r\nyears’ standing were not interfered with, and their owners were left\r\nin undisturbed possession, but such as had been enclosed for a shorter\r\nperiod were claimed by the Lord of the Manor, who lived some twelve\r\nmiles away, and possessed little or no land in the parish. He advanced\r\nhis claim cautiously, asking only a nominal rent, and as unlettered\r\npeasants felt the inequality of a contest in the matter, this rent\r\nwas paid. Consequently more than half the cottage holdings fell into\r\nhis hands, and the poor occupiers were deprived of the ownership of\r\nthe dwellings they had erected, and of all the improvements they had\r\nput into the land they had enclosed. None of them had to leave their\r\nholdings, and the rent at first charged was trifling; but except in\r\ncases where life-leases were granted, the cottagers had lost all their\r\nrights, and they and their holdings were left entirely in the hands of\r\na large landowner.”\r\n\r\nThe Enclosure Act, of course, prevented the creation of any more\r\ncottage holdings. The fertility of the soil in these small holdings,\r\nMr. Swain says, is enormously greater than that of the land, naturally\r\nsimilar, on the other side of the hedge. Usually the cottager gets a\r\nneighbouring farmer to plough half an acre of his holding for him,\r\npaying for this service in labour at harvest time; and keeps the rest,\r\nexcept the garden plot, under grass. The average size of the holding\r\nis about six acres; which is found sufficient for two cows, a heifer,\r\na calf, several pigs, thirty fowls, and a dozen ducks. The produce\r\nsupplies all the vegetables, fruit, milk, butter, eggs and bacon\r\nconsumed by the family, and brings in the following money returns, on\r\nMr. Swain’s calculations:--\r\n\r\n                                                             £  s. d.\r\n  One cow and one calf sold per annum (the\r\n    other calf being reared to replace the\r\n    cow sold)                                               14  0  0\r\n\r\n  Six pounds of butter per week, at 1_s._ per lb.           15 12  0\r\n\r\n  1 pig, sold at a net profit of                             2 10  0\r\n\r\n  20 fowls                                                   2  5  0\r\n\r\n  400 eggs (allowing 600 for home consumption)               1  8  0\r\n                                                            ────────\r\n                                                           £35 15  0\r\n                                                            ════════\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Swain writes from an intimate personal knowledge, I have no\r\nhesitation in accepting his statement as approximately accurate.\r\n\r\nThe injury to the cottagers does not end with the prevention of the\r\ncreation of fresh holdings, and the transfer of the ownership of most\r\nof those already existing to the lord of the manor. For the landlord,\r\nmanaging his estate in the ordinary way, through the intermediaries of\r\nsteward and agent, is almost invariably led into merging such small\r\nholdings into larger farms, in spite of the high rents which would\r\noften be gladly paid.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that these two cases are in the nature of things\r\ntypical. Similar hardships may be regarded as the almost inevitable\r\neffect of any enclosure which included any considerable quantity of\r\nwaste land; and if the enclosure is necessary or highly desirable,\r\nsome compensating advantages ought to be provided for the inhabitants\r\nas such. The smallness of such provision between 1845 and 1875 is very\r\nsignificant. And it makes one seriously doubt whether in their zeal for\r\nfurthering improved culture, the Commissioners were as considerate as\r\nwas desirable to the cottager who had a legal common right. But on that\r\npoint we can apply no statistical test.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from enclosures since 1845 to enclosures before, we have\r\na verdict from the old Board of Agriculture in its General Report\r\non Enclosures published in 1808, which, so far as it is biassed, is\r\nbiassed entirely in favour of enclosure. It says: “The benefit (of\r\nenclosure) in this case (to the poor) is by no means unmixed.”\r\n\r\nThe loss of fuel is declared to be the chief injury; and besides, “In\r\nsome cases many cows had been kept without a legal right, and nothing\r\nhad been given for the practice.”\r\n\r\n“In other cases, where allotments were assigned, the cottagers could\r\nnot pay the expense of the measure, and were forced to sell their\r\nallotments.”\r\n\r\n“In others they kept cows by right of hiring their cottages, or common\r\nrights, and the land going, of course, to their proprietor, was added\r\nto the farms, and the poor sold their cows. This is a very common\r\ncase.”[63]\r\n\r\n [63] “General Report on Enclosures,” pp. 12, 13.\r\n\r\nThe results are given of an investigation into the results of\r\nsixty-eight Enclosure Acts, chiefly in the Eastern Counties; testimony\r\nhaving been obtained from the clergy and others considered to be\r\nimpartial witnesses. In fifteen cases it is asserted that the poor were\r\nnot injured by the enclosure; in fifty-three cases that they were. The\r\ngeneral tenour of the statement in these cases is to the effect that\r\nthe condition of the poor has become very much worse, that they have\r\nlost all their cows,[64] and they no longer are able to buy milk for\r\ntheir children. Here are a few of the more striking descriptions:--\r\n\r\n [64] This is specifically asserted in 17 cases.\r\n\r\nAckworth, Yorkshire. The parish belonged to near 200 owners; nearly the\r\nwhole of whom have come to the parish since the enclosure, or changed\r\nthe quantity of their lands.\r\n\r\nTodenham, Gloucester. Nothing increased but the poor. Eight farmhouses\r\nfilled with them.\r\n\r\nTingewick, Bucks. Milk to be had at 1_d._ a quart before; not to be had\r\nnow at any rate.\r\n\r\nPassenham, Northamptonshire. (The poor) deprived of their cows, and\r\ngreat sufferers by the loss of their hogs.\r\n\r\nTulvy, Bedfordshire. Cows lessened from 110 to 40.\r\n\r\nLetcomb, Berkshire. The poor can no longer keep a cow, and they are\r\ntherefore now maintained by the parish.[65]\r\n\r\n [65] “General Report on Enclosures,” pp. 150–152.\r\n\r\nAlconbury, Huntingdon. (1791, c. 70.) Several who kept cows before\r\nwere, upon enclosure, forced to part with them, and have kept none\r\nsince. The cottage allotments going to the landlords were thrown\r\ntogether, and the inhabitants left without cows or land. Those who had\r\nallotments given in lieu of their rights, not being able to enclose\r\nthem,[66] were forced to sell, and became as the rest in this respect.\r\nBefore enclosure milk could readily be bought, poor people could lay\r\nout a half-penny or a penny every day, but nothing of the sort could be\r\ngot since.[67]\r\n\r\n [66] Because of the expense.\r\n\r\n [67] “General Report,” p. 154.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Buckingham in general, we have the following statement\r\nfrom a later survey for the Board of the County:--\r\n\r\n“The poor and persons with little capital (such as butchers, common\r\nshepherds, etc.) derive benefit from open fields and commons, by being\r\nenabled to keep horses, cows, and sheep.... It will be difficult to\r\nprove that in any case the poor have been benefited (by enclosure).\r\nNo instances of benefit on this score have been stated to me. On the\r\ncontrary, an increase of poor (_i.e._, of paupers) has been the general\r\ncomplaint.”\r\n\r\nSimilar evidence is given by two professional Enclosure Commissioners.\r\nMr. Forster, of Norwich, “lamented that he had been accessory to\r\ninjuring 2000 poor people, at the rate of twenty families per parish.\r\nNumbers in the practice of feeding the commons cannot prove their\r\nright; and many, indeed most who have allotments, have not more than\r\none acre, which being insufficient for the man’s cow, both the cow\r\nand land are usually sold to opulent farmers. The right sold before\r\nthe allotment produced much less than the allotment after it, but the\r\nmoney is dissipated, doing them no good when they cannot vest it in\r\nstock.”[68]\r\n\r\n [68] “General Report,” p. 157.\r\n\r\nMr. Ewen, another Commissioner, “observed that in most of the\r\nenclosures he has known the poor man’s allotment and cow are sold\r\nfive times in six before the award is signed.” A third Commissioner,\r\nMr. Algar, declared that he made it a practice to give an allotment\r\nwhenever a cottager could merely prove that he had been in the practice\r\nof cutting turf. But one wonders whether Mr. Algar did not find this\r\ncustom of his prejudicial to the demand for his professional services.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the weight of this evidence, both as to depopulation\r\nand as to injury to the poor, it must be borne in mind that it is\r\ntaken almost entirely from the mouths of advocates, and mostly very\r\nenthusiastic advocates, of enclosure. They are admissions of men\r\nwho feel that the general case in favour of enclosure is so strong\r\nthat they may well candidly admit the existence of some drawbacks.\r\nOf course, some advocates of enclosure are not disposed to make any\r\nadmissions at all. Many urge the moral evils engendered by waste\r\nlands, as: “Where wastes and commons are most extensive, there I have\r\nperceived the Cottagers are the most wretched and worthless; accustomed\r\nto relie on a precarious and vagabond subsistence from land in a\r\nstate of nature, when that fails they recur to pilfering, and thereby\r\nbecome a nuisance to their honest and industrious neighbours; and if\r\nthe father of a family of this sort is withdrawn from society for his\r\ncrimes, his children become burthensome to the parish. It may truly be\r\nsaid that for cottagers of this description the game is preserved, and\r\nby them destroyed; they are mostly beneath the law and out of reach\r\nof detection; and while they can earn four or five shillings, and\r\nsometimes more, in a night, by poaching, they will not be satisfied\r\nwith 10_d._ or 1_s._ a day for honest labour.”[69] A not unusual style\r\nof argument is the following:--\r\n\r\n [69] D. Walker, “Hertfordshire” (1794), p. 53.\r\n\r\n“To deprive the poor of that benefit, which, in their present state,\r\nthey derive from the waste lands, must no doubt, at first view, sound\r\nharsh. But it ought to be remembered that in this wealthy county, where\r\nthere is so much work to be done, and so few hands comparatively to\r\ndo it, there are few poor that do not deserve to be so. Those persons\r\nwho are disqualified to provide for the calls of human nature by the\r\nfeebleness of infancy, the crushing hand of disease, or the infirmities\r\nof old age, cannot be said to be poor, because _all_ the landed\r\nproperty, situate within their respective parishes, is always liable to\r\nbe charged with their maintenance.”[70]\r\n\r\n [70] John Clark, “Hereford” (1794), p. 27.\r\n\r\nAfter reading of the good fortune of these Herefordshire labourers,\r\nso much in demand in a wealthy county that the benefits derived from\r\nwastes and commons are of little concern to them, one naturally\r\ninquires, what were their wages? Day labourers earned in summer, “6_s._\r\na week and a gallon of drink to each man”;[71] in winter, 5_s._ a week\r\nand three quarts; in harvest, 14_d._ a day and meat and drink: the\r\nhours of labour being in harvest time and in winter as early and as\r\nlate as they could see; in summer, not harvest, from 6 to 6. Leaving\r\nout the cider, this works out at a penny an hour, and a penny in 1794\r\nwould not buy very much more of the ultimate necessaries of life in\r\nHerefordshire than it will to-day.\r\n\r\n [71] _Ibid._, p. 29. “Drink” of course means cider.\r\n\r\nThere seems, underlying John Clark’s words, a notion that if any injury\r\nis done to the poor by enclosure, proper and sufficient compensation\r\nwill be made in the ordinary course to the persons injured out of the\r\npoor-rates. The logical deduction is that the profits of enclosure\r\nshould contribute to the poor-rates, and I have noted thirteen\r\nenclosures of wastes and commons in which this was done. Another\r\nlogical deduction was that the poor rate in parishes in which waste was\r\nenclosed was, in part at least, a species of common property belonging\r\nto the poor; and to deprive them of this property was robbery, unless\r\nthe commons were restored. This view was vigorously expressed by\r\nCobbett in his “Political Register,” at the time of the introduction of\r\nthe Poor Law of 1834, and from him became part of the traditional stock\r\nof political ideas handed down through the Chartists to the Labour\r\nmovement of recent times.\r\n\r\nArthur Young, in a pamphlet published in 1801,[72] not only insists\r\nupon the injury to the poor from Enclosure Acts as ordinarily drawn and\r\nput into execution, but pleads for enclosure on methods which would\r\ntend to the social elevation of the labourer. His proposals, which\r\nstrike one as, for the time, wise and statesmanlike, though they ignore\r\nsome considerations which would be of great importance to-day, were:\r\n\r\n(1) That in the case of small commons in the midst of an enclosed\r\ncountry, labourers should be allowed to absorb the whole by gradual\r\nencroachments, thus building up small properties for themselves.\r\n\r\n(2) In the case of extensive wastes, procedure must be by Act of\r\nParliament, but all Acts should secure enough land for every cottager\r\nto keep a cow both summer and winter, such land to be _inalienable from\r\nthe cottage, and the ownership to be vested in the parish_.\r\n\r\n [72] “Enquiry into the propriety of applying wastes to the better\r\n support and nourishment of the poor.”\r\n\r\nI have found one Act which realises Arthur Young’s ideal of an\r\nEnclosure Act. It was passed in 1824 for Pottern in Wiltshire, and\r\nthough it was an Act for the enclosure of a common only, no commonable\r\nmeadow or common field being included, I give its provisions here on\r\naccount of its intrinsic interest.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of the whole common was vested in the Bishop of\r\nSalisbury, who was lord of the manor, the vicar and churchwardens,\r\nin trust for the parish. The trustees were required to lease it in\r\nsmall holdings, with or without rent, to poor, honest, and industrious\r\npersons, who had not, except in cases of accident or illness, availed\r\nthemselves of Poor Law relief.\r\n\r\nThe following Acts, all (except that for Earsham) for “extinguishing\r\nvillage communities,” _i.e._, for enclosing all the commonable lands\r\nof the parishes or townships, which in each case include commonable\r\narable fields, have special provisions to safeguard the interests of\r\nthe poor:--\r\n\r\n1757, c. 53. Wimeswould, Leicestershire. Cottagers who have no land are\r\nto have a share together within one fence, which they may afterwards\r\nseparately enclose if they like. This is specially interesting as\r\nanticipating the modern practice of providing allotments for such\r\ncottagers.\r\n\r\n1767, c. 49. Carlton in Lindrick, Nottingham. Three acres (out of a\r\ntotal of 2492 acres) are to be set aside for building cottages for the\r\nbenefit of the poor.\r\n\r\n1779, c. 89. Evenley or Bury Manor, Northampton. Lands to the value of\r\n£10 per annum (out of £1200) are to be set aside for the most deserving\r\npoor not receiving poor-relief.\r\n\r\n1785, c. 56. Eight parishes in Wiltshire enclosed by one Act. Not more\r\nthan ten acres in each parish is to be set aside, free of taxes, for\r\nfuel for the poor.\r\n\r\n1805, c. 19. Palling, Norfolk. One-twentieth of the whole area is to be\r\nvested in the lord of the manor, vicar, and overseers, in trust for the\r\npoor, for common of pasture and fuel.\r\n\r\n1807, c. 18. Herringswell, Suffolk. An allotment is to be made for fuel\r\nfor the poor.\r\n\r\n1809, c. 7. Barton Turf, Norfolk. Thirty acres is to be reserved for\r\ncommon for the poor.\r\n\r\n1810, c. 55. Great Sheepey, Leicestershire. _Every cottage to have not\r\nless than 3 acres allotted to it._\r\n\r\n1812, c. 3. Little Brandon, Norfolk. Ten acres to be set aside for the\r\nbenefit of the poor, partly to be used as common for fuel, or to be\r\nleased to pay for fuel; another part to provide a common pasture for\r\nthe poor inhabitants; while the _remainder_ (how much? one wonders)\r\nwas to be leased in aid of the poor-rates.\r\n\r\n1812, c. 17. Earsham, Norfolk. Five acres to be set aside to be leased\r\nto buy fuel for the poor.\r\n\r\nAlso in the Acts for Northwold, Norfolk (1796, c. 14), Lower Wilbraham,\r\nCambridge (1797, c. 89), and Barnady, Suffolk, allotments were made\r\ninalienable from the cottages for which they were assigned. At\r\nNorthwold land capable of supplying annually 12,000 turves per annum\r\nwas reserved as a common turbary for the poorer owners of common\r\nrights.[73]\r\n\r\n [73] I must here refer to the extraordinary Act by which Pickering\r\n Moor (Yorkshire, West Riding) was enclosed in 1785 and divided equally\r\n among all owners of common rights, the poorest cottager owning an\r\n ancient cottage getting as much as the largest landowner. Before\r\n enclosure the yeomen of Pickering had pastured such animals on the\r\n moor as they could provide with winter keep. The great tithes were\r\n rented by an enterprising lessee, who conceived the idea of parcelling\r\n the moor into small farms which would grow corn and yield tithes. In\r\n spite of the disinclination of the yeomen to any change, he procured\r\n the passing of an Enclosure Act, in which it was declared that the\r\n moor was equally the property of all ancient cottages and messuages,\r\n and was required to be divided equally among the owners of all of\r\n these. A peculiar clause in the Act enacted that no part of the moor\r\n should be “deemed barren in respect of tithes.” The larger yeomen\r\n felt themselves to be cheated, and were very indignant, but through\r\n inertness and lack of co-operation they failed to take steps to\r\n prevent the Act being executed. This they presumably might have done\r\n by an appeal to Quarter Sessions.\r\n\r\nThis list of Acts containing special provisions for the benefit of the\r\npoor is not a complete one, but if it were it would not, I believe,\r\ninclude more than one per cent. of the Enclosure Acts passed prior\r\nto 1845. Arthur Young did not over-state the case when he wrote: “By\r\nnineteen Enclosure Acts out of twenty, the poor are injured, in some\r\ngrossly injured.... The poor in these parishes may say, and with truth,\r\n_Parliament may be tender of property, all I know is, I had a cow, and\r\nan Act of Parliament has taken it from me_.”[74]\r\n\r\n [74] “Enquiry into the propriety of applying wastes to the better\r\n support and maintenance of the poor,” 1801, p. 42.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHREE ACRES AND A COW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the poor were not always the only sufferers from an Enclosure Act,\r\nis shown by the account given by the General Report on Enclosures of\r\nthe way in which farmers were affected. After referring to the idea\r\nthat opposition from farmers is usually to be ascribed to ignorant\r\nprejudice, the report proceeds:--\r\n\r\n“In many instances they have suffered considerably for four, five,\r\nor six years. From the first starting the project of an Enclosure Act\r\nto the final award, has, in numerous cases, taken two, three, four,\r\nand even five or six years; their management is deranged; not knowing\r\nwhere their future lands will be allotted, they save all their dung\r\ntill much of it is good for little; they perform all the operations of\r\ntillage with inferior attention; perhaps the fields are cross-cropped\r\nand exhausted, and not well recovered under a course of years. Rents\r\nare greatly raised and too soon; so that if they do not absolutely lose\r\nfive years they at least suffer a great check. In point of profit,\r\ncomparing the old with the new system, attention must be paid to their\r\ncapitals; open field land is managed (notwithstanding the inconvenience\r\nof its pieces) usually with a less capital than enclosures; and though\r\nthe _general_ profit of the latter exceeds that of the former, yet this\r\nwill entirely depend on the capital being adequate. In cases where the\r\nnew enclosures are laid down to grass, all this becomes of tenfold\r\nforce; to stock rich grass lands demands a far greater sum than open\r\nfield arable; the farmer may not possess it; this has often happened,\r\nand drove them to seek other investments, giving way to new-comers more\r\nable to undertake the new system introduced; and if profit be measured\r\nby a percentage on the capital employed, the old system might, at the\r\nold rents, exceed the profits of the new; and this is certainly the\r\nfarmers’ view of the comparison. He also who had given the attention\r\nof a life to the regular routine of open field arable, without 10\r\nacres of grass ever having been in his occupation, may find himself\r\nmuch at a loss in the regular purchase and sale of live stock, the\r\nprofit of which depends so much on habitual skill. Add to all this the\r\nprevious circumstance of laying down to grass, the business of all\r\nothers of which farmers know the least, of which I have many times\r\nseen in new enclosures striking instances; and if all these points be\r\nduly considered, we shall not find much reason to be surprised at the\r\nrepugnance shown by many farmers to the idea of enclosing.” (Pp. 31,\r\n32.)\r\n\r\nWhile the whole of this description of the ordeal that the farmers had\r\nto pass through is interesting, the point I desire here to emphasize\r\nis the need of a larger capital after enclosure. Those who had the\r\nrequisite skill, knowledge, energy and capital survived the crisis;\r\nthey were able to take up the farms which their weaker neighbours\r\nwere compelled to relinquish; to send, in almost every case, a larger\r\n_surplus_ of food from the lands of the parish to maintain the state\r\nand power of England, and to pay higher rents. In perhaps the majority\r\nof cases they raised a larger gross produce, and provided maintenance\r\nand employment for a larger population than before. In some cases even\r\n(though these were rare exceptions) the labouring population gained\r\nin material prosperity as well as in numbers. But in any case the\r\nrelationship between employer and employed was notably altered.\r\n\r\nIn the open field village the entirely landless labourer was scarcely\r\nto be found. The division of holdings into numerous scattered pieces,\r\nmany of which were of minute size, made it easy for a labourer to\r\nobtain what were in effect allotments in the common fields. If he had\r\nno holding, he still might have a common right; if no acknowledged\r\ncommon right, he might enjoy the advantage of one in a greater or less\r\ndegree. From the poorest labourer to the richest farmer, there was,\r\nin the typical open field village, a gradation of rank. There was no\r\nperceptible social gap between the cottager who worked the greater part\r\nof his time for others, and for the smaller part of his time on his own\r\nholding, who is therefore properly termed a labourer, and his neighbour\r\nwho reversed that distribution of time, and is therefore to be deemed a\r\nfarmer. It was easy for the efficient or fortunate man to rise on such\r\na social ladder; equally easy for the inefficient or unlucky to slip\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\nAfter enclosure the comparatively few surviving farmers, enriched,\r\nelevated intellectually as well as socially by the successful struggle\r\nwith a new environment, faced, across a deep social gulf, the labourers\r\nwho had now only their labour to depend upon. In the early part of\r\nthe nineteenth century, at any rate, it was almost impossible for a\r\nlabourer to cross that gulf; on his side the farmer henceforward,\r\ninstead of easily becoming a farm labourer if bankrupt, would rather\r\ntry his fortune in the growing industrial towns.\r\n\r\nOur “Country Farmer” gives us a vivid picture of one side of the social\r\nchange (“Thoughts on Enclosure,” p. 21). Of the farmer after enclosure\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n“Their entertainments are as expensive as they are elegant, for it is\r\nno uncommon thing for one of these new created farmers to spend ten or\r\ntwelve pounds at one entertainment; and to wash down delicate food,\r\nmust have the most expensive wines, and these the best of their kind;\r\nand to set off the entertainment in the greatest splendour, an elegant\r\nsideboard of plate is provided in the newest fashion. As to dress\r\nno one that was not personally acquainted with the opulent farmer’s\r\ndaughter can distinguish her from the daughter of a Duke by her dress,\r\nboth equally wishing to imitate something, but they know not what.\r\n\r\n“View the farmer before the land was inclosed, and you will find him\r\nentertaining his friends with a part of a hog of his own feeding, and a\r\ndraught of ale brewed from his own malt presented in a brown jug, or a\r\nglass, if it would bear it, which was the utmost of his extravagance:\r\nin those happy days you might view the farmer in a coat of the growth\r\nof his flock; and spun by his industrious wife and daughters, and his\r\nstockings produced from the same quarter of his industry, and his wife\r\nand daughters clad from their own hands of industry and their own\r\nflock.”\r\n\r\nAs for the other side of this social change, the labourer’s side, it\r\nseemed so serious an evil to many even of the progressive landlords\r\nand agriculturists who strongly advocated enclosure, that they busied\r\nthemselves to find a remedy.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the Board of Agriculture drew the attention of its members to a\r\ntypical case. Mr. Thomas Bernard communicated an “Account of a Cottage\r\nand Garden near Tadcaster.” The cottager had held two acres of land\r\nand a common right at Poppleton for nine years, and there had lived\r\ncomfortably and brought up six children. The enclosure of the parish\r\nturned him adrift, but he prevailed upon a landlord to let him have\r\na piece of roadside waste for a garden, saying, “I will show you the\r\n_fashions_ on it.” The landlord was so delighted afterwards with the\r\nway in which this garden was cultivated, that he offered the man to let\r\nhim have it rent free. Particular attention was directed to the man’s\r\nreply:--“Now, sir, you have a pleasure in seeing my cottage and garden\r\nneat: and why should not other squires have the same pleasure in seeing\r\nthe cottages and gardens nice about them? The poor would then be happy\r\nand would love them and the place where they lived; but now every nook\r\nof land is let to the great farmers; and nothing left for the poor but\r\nto go to the parish.” (“Communications to the Board,” Vol. I. p. 404.)\r\n\r\nIt was by “going to the parish” that the labourer could bring home to\r\nthe landlord the idea that the spirit of ambition and self-reliance\r\nfostered by the possession of two acres and a common right was of\r\nvalue to the nation. The national emergency due to the famine prices\r\nof food during the French War, which produced the complete change in\r\nthe spirit of the administration of the Poor Law associated with the\r\n“Speenhamland Act of Parliament,” also forced into public attention the\r\ndesirability of both providing agricultural labourers with some other\r\nsupplement to their wages, and of encouraging them to avoid pauperism.\r\nWe accordingly find the Board of Agriculture offering for 1800 three\r\ngold medals:--\r\n\r\n“To the person who shall build on his estate the most cottages for\r\nlabouring families, and assign to each a proper portion of land, for\r\nthe support of not less than a cow, a hog, and a sufficient garden--the\r\nGold Medal.”\r\n\r\n“To the person who shall produce the most satisfactory account of the\r\nbest means of supporting cows on poor land in a method applicable to\r\ncottagers--the Gold Medal,” (doubts having been raised with regard to\r\nthe practicability of cottagers keeping cows except on rich soil).\r\n\r\n“The Board having received information that the labouring poor of\r\nRutland and Lincolnshire, having land for one or two cows, and a\r\nsufficiency of potatoes, have not applied, in the present scarcity, for\r\nany poor law relief; and it appearing to be a great national object\r\nto spread so beneficial a system, the Board will give to the person\r\nwho shall explain, in the most satisfactory manner, the best means for\r\nrendering this practice as general through the kingdom as circumstances\r\nwill admit--the Gold Medal.” (“Communications,” Vol. II.)\r\n\r\nEach of these medals was again offered in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nThe question appears to have been first brought before the Board\r\nof Agriculture by the Earl of Winchilsea, in a conversation at the\r\nFarmers’ Club with Sir John Sinclair, President of the Board, in 1795.\r\nAt Sir John Sinclair’s request, the Earl of Winchilsea put his views in\r\nwriting, and they were submitted to the Board, in the form of a letter,\r\ndated Jan. 4th, 1796. This letter is a convincing statement in favour\r\nof the case for “three acres and a cow,” and deserves the attention of\r\npoliticians of to-day.\r\n\r\nBeginning by stating that he has made further enquiries, since the\r\nconversation with Sir John Sinclair, into the practice of agricultural\r\nlabourers keeping cows, he continues:--“I am more and more confirmed\r\nin the opinion I have long had, that nothing is so beneficial, both to\r\nthem and to the landowners, as their having land to be occupied either\r\nfor the keeping of cows, or as gardens, according to circumstances.\r\nBy means of these advantages, the labourers and their families live\r\nbetter, and are consequently more fit to endure labour; and it makes\r\nthem more contented, and gives them a sort of independence, which makes\r\nthem set a higher value on their character.... When a labourer has\r\nobtained a cow, and land sufficient to maintain her, the first thing he\r\nhas thought of has been how he could save money enough to buy another;\r\n... there are from 70 to 80 labourers upon my estate in Rutland, who\r\nkeep from 1 to 4 cows each.... I am informed that those who manage\r\nwell clear about 20_d._ per week, or £4 6_s._ 8_d._ per ann. by each\r\ncow.”[75]\r\n\r\n [75] Milk being valued at 1_d._ per quart; it seems clear also that\r\n what is consumed at home is not included in this calculation.\r\n\r\nIf the cow died, it was, he says, a great misfortune for the labourer,\r\nbut he contrived to beg or borrow the money necessary to obtain another\r\ncow--“I scarcely ever knew a cow-gait given up for want of ability to\r\nobtain a cow, except in the case of old and infirm women.”\r\n\r\nHe classifies the situation of labourers, in order of felicity, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Those who have a sufficient quantity of grass enclosed land to\r\nenable them to keep one or more cows winter and summer, and a garden\r\nnear their house; a grass field allotted to a certain number being as\r\nadvantageous, or nearly so, as separate small enclosures.\r\n\r\n(2) Those who have a summer pasture for their cow, and some arable\r\nland, on which they grow the winter provision. This is slightly less\r\nadvantageous than (1), because tilling the arable land takes up more\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n(3) Those who have a right of common for the summer keep of the cow,\r\nand a meadow, or arable ground, or the share of a meadow in common,\r\nfor the winter provision. If it were not that commons are usually\r\nover-stocked, this would be equivalent to (1) or (2).\r\n\r\n(4) Those who have a right of common, but no cow, and a garden. In this\r\ncase geese and pigs can be kept.\r\n\r\n(5) Those who have a right of common and no garden. In this case the\r\nvalue of the right of common depends upon whether fuel is obtained from\r\nthe common or not.\r\n\r\n(6) Those who have several acres of arable land, and no summer pasture\r\nfor a cow. This, he maintains, is of little value, because of the large\r\nexpenditure of labour necessary for cultivating the land, but he admits\r\nthat many would differ from him on this point.\r\n\r\n(7) Those who have a garden near the house.\r\n\r\n(8) Those who have no land whatever. “This is a very bad situation for\r\na labourer to be placed in, both for his comfort and the education of\r\nhis children.”\r\n\r\nThen he continues, in words which seem in general as true and weighty\r\nnow as when written or as at any time within the last hundred\r\nyears:--“In countries where it has never been the custom for labourers\r\nto keep cows, it would be very difficult to introduce it; but where\r\nno gardens have been annexed to the cottages it is sufficient to give\r\nthe ground, and the labourer is sure to know what to do with it, and\r\nwill reap an immediate benefit from it ... there should be as much as\r\nwill produce all the garden stuff the family consumes, and enough,\r\nwith the addition of a little meal, for a pig. I think they ought to\r\npay the same rent that a farmer would pay for the land, and no more.\r\nI am persuaded that it frequently happens that a labourer lives in a\r\nhouse at 20_s._ a year rent, which he is unable to pay, to which, if a\r\ngarden of a rood was added, for which he would have to pay five or ten\r\nshillings a year more, that he would be enabled, by the profit he would\r\nderive from the garden, to pay the rent of the house, etc., with great\r\nadvantage to himself.\r\n\r\n“As I before mentioned, some difficulties may occur in establishing\r\nthe custom of labourers keeping cows in those parts of the country\r\nwhere no such custom has existed; wherever it has or does exist\r\nit ought by all means to be encouraged, and not suffered to fall\r\ninto disuse, as has been the case to a great degree in the midland\r\ncounties, one of the causes of which I apprehend to be, the dislike\r\nthe generality of farmers have to seeing the labourers rent any land.\r\nPerhaps one of their reasons for disliking this is, that the land, if\r\nnot occupied by the labourers, would fall to their share; and another,\r\nI am afraid, is, that they rather wish to have the labourers more\r\ndependent upon them, for which reasons they are always desirous of\r\nhiring the house and land occupied by a labourer, under pretence, that\r\nby that means the landlord will be secure of his rent, and that they\r\nwill keep the house in repair. This the agents of estates are too apt\r\nto give in to, as they find it much less trouble to meet six than sixty\r\ntenants at a rent day, and by this means avoid the being sometimes\r\nobliged to hear the wants and complaints of the poor.” ... The landlord\r\nnaturally yields to this pressure ... “and it is in this manner that\r\nthe labourers have been dispossessed of their cow-pastures in various\r\nparts of the midland counties. The moment the farmer obtains his wish,\r\nhe takes every particle of the land to himself, and relets the house to\r\nthe labourer, who by this means is rendered miserable, the poors rate\r\nincreased, the value of the estate to the landlord diminished, and the\r\nhouse suffered to go to decay.... Whoever travels through the midland\r\ncounties, and will take the trouble of enquiring, will generally\r\nreceive the answer, that formerly there were a great many cottagers who\r\nkept cows, but that the land is now thrown to the farmers; and if he\r\nenquires still further, he will find that in those parishes the poors\r\nrates have increased in an amazing degree, more than according to the\r\naverage rise throughout England.”\r\n\r\nSir John Sinclair,[76] President of the Board of Agriculture, did not\r\nagree that a plot of a few acres of arable land was, by itself, of\r\nlittle value to the agricultural labourer. He estimates that two cows\r\ncan be kept on 3¼ acres of arable land, and that the net produce,\r\nvaluing milk at 1_d._ per quart, would amount to £21 per annum, about\r\nas much as the man’s wages. He advocated spade labour, and recommended\r\nthat the cottager should rather hire men to dig for him, than get the\r\nland ploughed. In confirmation of this opinion Sir Henry Vavasour\r\ncited an example of a cottager holding 3 acres who kept two cows and\r\ntwo pigs. The butter alone paid the rent, and the gross produce was\r\nestimated at £54 per annum, exclusive of milk and vegetables consumed\r\nat home.\r\n\r\n [76] “Communications to the Board of Agriculture,” IV., p. 358.\r\n\r\nIt is of course practically impossible to calculate how much effect\r\nthis landowners’ agitation for the policy of “Three acres and a cow”\r\nhad on the number of such cottage holdings. Lord Brownlow[77] writes:\r\n“In all open field lordships there have always been pastures in which\r\nthe cottagers have had their share of benefit; but the practice\r\nof enabling cottagers to keep cows in inclosed parishes, is in my\r\nneighbourhood rare, and of recent date.” Accounts are sent of cottage\r\nholdings provided by the Earl of Carrington, and of large allotments\r\nprovided by Mr. Thomas Estcourt; but I cannot say how extensively their\r\nexample was followed.\r\n\r\n [77] “Communications to the Board of Agriculture,” IV., p. 367.\r\n\r\nMr. W. E. Bear’s report to the recent Labour Commission, on the\r\nagricultural labourers of the Southwell Union, contains the\r\nfollowing passage, in which we probably see some fruits of the\r\nEarl of Winchilsea’s movement:--“Small holdings, of three to ten\r\nacres commonly, are let with cottages in a few parishes, and called\r\n‘cottagers.’ This custom appears to be a very old one, dating back far\r\nbeyond the time when the term ‘three acres and a cow’ was invented.\r\nIn Ossington, Mr. Richardson told me, it was 50 years old or more;\r\nbut he said it was falling into disuse. I found some ‘cottagers’ in\r\nAverham, Ossington and Hockerton, and heard of them in another parish\r\nor two. They usually consist of grass land, and are best so, as the\r\nlabourer can leave his wife to manage the cow or two kept on them,\r\nand work for wages regularly. In Averham some of these small holdings\r\nhave been given up, apparently because they were partly arable, and\r\noccupiers found that they could not keep regular places and also attend\r\nto their land. But where the land is all pasture, they are excellent\r\ninstitutions, providing families with milk, and adding to the incomes\r\nby means of milk or butter, poultry, eggs and pork sold. These little\r\nholdings are let from £2 10_s._ to £3 an acre, including the cottage”\r\n(par. 51 A).\r\n\r\nThe same Commissioner found in Leicestershire a system of common\r\ncow-runs for cottagers which also probably dates from the eighteenth\r\ncentury, being in some way a survival from the common field system. He\r\ndescribes it as follows:--\r\n\r\n“There are cow plots let with cottages in several parishes. Some have\r\nalready been referred to as existing on the Earl of Dysart’s estate.\r\nOne example is to be found at Saxby, where cow runs of 6 a. 3 r. 12 p.,\r\neach in common, are let with a cottage and garden at £10 per annum. At\r\nGrimston I visited some which are let by Mr. Wright or Mr. Reckitts,\r\nwho appear to be somehow connected on the same estate.... Some of\r\nthese cow-plots are 3½ acres in extent, and their holders are allowed\r\nto keep only one cow, as three or more of them occupy a pasture in\r\ncommon, having a portion of their 3½ acres each year to mow and another\r\nportion to feed. The rent, including cottage and garden, is £10. There\r\nare some other cow plots of 8 acres on which two or three cows are\r\nkept, the rent being £15. In these cases, too, the pasture is common\r\nto several holders, each one having a piece to mow, while they run\r\ntheir cows together on the portion devoted to grazing. As an example of\r\nthe advantage which a cow plot may sometimes be to a labourer and his\r\nfamily, I may mention the case of a widow who has 3½ acres and a very\r\ngood cottage for £10 per annum. Last year she had an exceptionally good\r\ncow, and she sold milk at the rate of 6_d._ a gallon, amounting to £15\r\n10_s._, fattening a calf which sold at £4 10_s._; altogether the return\r\nwas £20, besides what milk was consumed in the cottage.”\r\n\r\nAnother probable survival of the Earl of Winchilsea’s movement is thus\r\ndescribed by Mr. Rider Haggard:--\r\n\r\n“The system of cottage holdings was introduced about a hundred years\r\nago on the Burley estate” (Rutlandshire) “and was copied by the late\r\nLord Tollemache, who was brother-in-law of the late Mr. Finch. It is in\r\nforce in the parishes of Burley, Egleton, Hambleton and Greetham. In\r\n1901 there lived in those parishes forty-three small occupiers, whose\r\nacreage varied from 5 acres to 40 acres, the holdings being all grass.\r\nOriginally there were many more, the Hambleton cow pasture, which is\r\n102 acres in estate, being divided into 80 cow commons. Some of the\r\nholders occupy two or more small fields, but the general custom has\r\nbeen for tenants to graze large fields in common, and to have separate\r\nsmall fields reserved for mowing hay in the winter. In the fields which\r\nare grazed in common, five roods have been taken as sufficient to keep\r\na cow.” (“Rural England,” Vol. II. p. 260.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL SUMMARY OF ENCLOSURE BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this table the cross-heading A includes Acts up to and including\r\nthe year 1801, in which year a general Act facilitating enclosure\r\nwas passed; cross-heading B, Acts from 1802–1845; cross-heading C,\r\nenclosures under the General Enclosure Act of 1845 and subsequent\r\namending Acts. No Act or enclosure is included unless the enclosure was\r\npartly of arable common field, but in some few cases, as will be seen\r\nfrom the Appendix giving the chief particulars of each Act, the arable\r\nland formed only a trifling part of the area dealt with.\r\n\r\nWhere the area enclosed is not stated, and cannot even be approximately\r\ninferred from the wording of the Act, it is estimated on the assumption\r\nthat the average area per Act where the area is not stated, is the\r\nsame as for Acts relating to the same county where the area affected\r\nis stated, enclosures under the Act of 1845 being left out of account.\r\nThis method, I believe, gives more satisfactory results than any other\r\nwould; but it must be confessed that in the case of Norfolk the Acts\r\nin which the area is not stated are so many, and those in which it is\r\nstated are so few, that the average obtained is not trustworthy. In\r\nthis case I believe the figure arrived at is too large. The counties\r\nare arranged in order of prevalence of Parliamentary enclosures.\r\n\r\n┌───────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┐\r\n│               │ Area stated.│

XIV.\r\n\r\nENCLOSURE OF COMMON FIELDS WITHOUT PARLIAMENTARY SANCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the map of England, in Chapter VII., enclosures of common field\r\nparishes by Act of Parliament before the General Enclosure Act of 1801\r\nare shaded vertically, such enclosures from 1802 to 1845 are dotted,\r\nand subsequent enclosures under the General Enclosure Act of 1845 are\r\nblack. In other words, all the shaded area represents the area of\r\nparishes which had arable common fields up to the year 1700, all the\r\ndotted and black area represents the area of parishes which had arable\r\ncommon fields up to 1801, and all the black area represents the area of\r\nparishes which had arable common fields up to 1845.\r\n\r\nWhat about the area which is not shaded at all?\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the map yields certain striking results.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we see that the shaded districts lie in a broad\r\nband across England from north-east to south-west, from the East Riding\r\nof Yorkshire to Dorset and the east part of Somerset.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we see that there is a perfectly sharp line of demarcation\r\nbetween the shaded and the non-shaded area, running through Suffolk,\r\nEssex, passing through London, and along the border between Surrey\r\nand Kent. This line becomes indefinite as it passes through the Weald\r\nof Surrey and Sussex, but its termination can be traced in the part\r\nof Sussex which lies on the southern slope of the South Downs. In the\r\nwhite area to the south-east of this line there are but two shaded\r\npatches--the parishes of Iken and Orford, in Suffolk, situated close\r\ntogether, in the peninsula formed by the estuaries of the rivers Alde\r\nand Deben.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we can trace an equally sharp line of demarcation between the\r\nshaded and the non-shaded area in the south-west, running from the\r\nBristol to the English Channel, across Somerset and Dorset. South-west\r\nof this line there is no shaded patch--_i.e._, there is no case of\r\ncommon field enclosed by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nFourthly, on the north-west side of the shaded belt, towards Wales and\r\nScotland, there is no sharp line of demarcation between the shaded and\r\nthe non-shaded area, but as one travels further and further from the\r\ncentral axis of the shaded area to the north-west, the shaded patches\r\nbecome sparser and sparser; but still some shaded patches are to be\r\nfound in every English county on this side of the shaded belt, except\r\nLancashire.\r\n\r\nFifthly, it is to be noticed that along the central axis of the shaded\r\nbelt the vertical shading--indicating enclosure by Act of Parliament\r\nin the eighteenth century--greatly predominates, and most of all the\r\nshading is overwhelmingly vertical in the very centre of the shaded\r\narea. Dotted and black patches, indicating Parliamentary enclosure\r\nin the nineteenth century, and particularly black, indicating the\r\nlatest group of Parliamentary enclosures, show more prominently in the\r\nedges or fringes of the coloured area. In other words, when the great\r\nmovement of Parliamentary Enclosure began in the eighteenth century,\r\nits chief field was the very centre of the district over which it\r\nultimately spread.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that there must be certain broad historical reasons for\r\nthese striking facts. The map, in fact, presents to us a series of\r\ndefinite puzzles for solution.\r\n\r\n1. How and when was the south-eastern corner of England enclosed?\r\n\r\n2. How and when was the south-western corner enclosed?\r\n\r\n3. How and when was the great district in the north-west, in which\r\nParliamentary enclosure is the exception, enclosed?\r\n\r\n4. How and when were the numerous parishes within what we may call the\r\nParliamentary Enclosure belt, which escaped Parliamentary enclosure,\r\nenclosed?\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, there is the question which sums these up, and presents the\r\nproblem on the other side--\r\n\r\n5. Why were special Acts of Parliament necessary for the enclosure\r\nof some three thousand of the English parishes, in the geographical\r\nposition indicated by the map?\r\n\r\nAnd it is important that it should be clearly understood that this is\r\nthe more natural way of putting the question, because the surprising\r\nfact is not that the common field system should gradually and quietly\r\ndisappear in parish A, but that it should persist in parish B, until\r\nended by the very expensive and troublesome measure of a special Act of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn order to proceed as far as possible from the known to the unknown,\r\nwe will first consider the various methods of common field enclosure\r\noperating within the belt of Parliamentary Enclosure of common fields.\r\nBut before beginning this enquiry, attention may be drawn to a ray\r\nof light which the map throws upon the social history of England in\r\nthe Tudor period. The reader of the history of that period is tempted\r\nto suppose that the districts from which the greatest complaints,\r\nand still more riots and insurrections, arose against enclosures,\r\nwere those in which enclosure was proceeding most rapidly. Now, the\r\nmost formidable of these popular agitations began in the reign of\r\nEdward VI. in Somersetshire, and spread northwards and eastwards,\r\ngrowing in intensity, till it reached its climax in Ket’s rebellion\r\nin Norfolk.[78] The earlier complaints also come from counties within\r\nthe Parliamentary Enclosure belt--Oxford, Buckingham, Wiltshire and\r\nothers. The map suggests that a possible interpretation of these\r\npopular movements is, that an industrial and economic change involving\r\nnormally the enclosure of common fields was in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries gradually spreading over the southern and midland\r\ncounties; that in some parts it met with little or no resistance; but\r\nthat in other parts popular resistance was roused to some features\r\nof this change, including the enclosure of arable fields, and that\r\npopular resistance was in a very great degree successful in causing\r\nthe postponement of such enclosure. Briefly, a special outcry against\r\nenclosure in a particular locality shows, not necessarily that\r\nenclosure was proceeding with special rapidity there, but possibly that\r\nthere it was specially obnoxious; and being there specially obnoxious,\r\nproceeded more slowly than elsewhere.\r\n\r\n [78] “Can it be denied that the fyrst rysynge this yeare was in\r\n Somersetshire, ffrom Somersetshire it entred into Gloucettershire,\r\n Wylshire, hampshire, Sussex, Surrey, Worcestershire, Essex,\r\n hertfordshire, and dyuers other places?” (John Hale’s Defence,\r\n “The Commonweal of this Realm of England,” Miss Lamond’s edition,\r\n p. lviii.) This is to prove that the rising was not caused by the\r\n Enclosure Commission of 1549. The Commissioners were sent to Oxford,\r\n Berkshire, Warwick, Leicester, Buckingham, and Northampton.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCLOSURE BY PRINCIPAL LANDLORD.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our own subject. We have shown that enclosure by\r\nAct of Parliament was greatly to the landlord’s interest; but it is\r\nperfectly obvious that the landlord’s interest was much more served by\r\nan enclosure without all the expense, loss of time, labour and anxiety\r\ninvolved in Parliamentary proceedings. Obviously, therefore, if one\r\nlandlord could acquire all the open and commonable land in the parish,\r\nhe would enclose without an Act of Parliament. The only difficulty\r\nin his way would be in arranging leases so that they should all fall\r\nin simultaneously, or, failing this, in overcoming the resistance of\r\nany tenant whose lease gave him the power of resisting, if he were\r\nunwilling to agree. We have noticed that even in recent years the\r\ncommon fields of Yelden in Bedfordshire have disappeared in this way;\r\nthat the Duchy of Cornwall in 1876 bought out all the copyholders\r\nholding lands in Fordington Field; that Earl Manvers is similarly\r\nacquiring by degrees all the common rights in the common fields of\r\nLaxton, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners are endeavouring in this\r\nway to procure the enclosure of Elmstone Hardwicke; that Stratton and\r\nGrimstone were thus enclosed since 1900, and that the common fields\r\nof several Berkshire parishes have thus disappeared within the last\r\nhalf-century. The same process can be watched on a much larger scale\r\nwith regard to common rights over commons proper. The buying up of\r\nthe rights of commoners over Dartmoor by the Duchy of Cornwall is\r\none striking example; similar purchases of common rights over the\r\nWiltshire downs on a very large scale have come into notice through the\r\napproach to Stonehenge being affected.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure of common fields in this way is proceeding slowly merely\r\nbecause the remains of common fields are now so small.\r\n\r\nAnd it is obvious that through the last two hundred years the\r\nrestraints of law and public opinion upon the freedom of the country\r\nsquire or great landowner, in doing as he likes with the villages\r\nunder his control, have been gradually and continuously strengthened.\r\nIn looking back over the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries, we are\r\nlooking back at a greater and greater proportion of local autocratic\r\npower accompanying any given degree of local pre-eminence in wealth and\r\nlanded property.\r\n\r\nIf we look back to the beginning of the eighteenth century we find the\r\nprinciples generally accepted by the landowning class with regard to\r\nthe general management of their estates, and particularly with regard\r\nto common fields, thus clearly laid down by Edward Lawrence in “The\r\nduty of a Steward to his Lord”:--\r\n\r\nArticle XIV. “A Steward should not forget to make the best Enquiry\r\ninto the Disposition of any of the Freeholders within or near any\r\nof his Lord’s Manors to sell their Lands, that he may use his best\r\nEndeavours to purchase them at as reasonable a price as may be for his\r\nlord’s Advantage and Convenience ... especially in such Manors where\r\nImprovements are to be made by inclosing Commons and Common fields....\r\nIf the Freeholders cannot _all_ be persuaded to sell yet at least an\r\nAgreement for Inclosing should be pushed forward by the Steward” (p. 9).\r\n\r\n“The Steward should not suffer any of the Lord’s lands to be let to\r\nFreehold Tenants within or near his Lord’s Manor” (p. 34).\r\n\r\n“The Steward should endeavour to lay all the small Farms, let to poor\r\nindigent People, to the great ones” ... but “It is unwise to unite\r\nfarms all at once, because of the odium and increase of Poor-rates. It\r\nis much more reasonable and popular to stay till such farms fall into\r\nHand by Death” (p. 35).\r\n\r\nAnd to facilitate this process, “Noblemen and Gentlemen should\r\nendeavour to convert copyhold for lives to Leasehold for lives” (p. 60).\r\n\r\nThe significance of this last recommendation may be illustrated\r\nby the passage in William Marshall’s account, in “Agriculture of\r\nGloucestershire,” published about sixty years afterwards, of the\r\nCotswold Hills:--\r\n\r\n“Thirty years ago this district lay almost entirely in an open state;\r\nnamely in arable common field, sheep-walk, and cowdown. At present it\r\nmay be said to be in a state of inclosure, though some few townships\r\nyet remain open.\r\n\r\n“The difficulties of Inclosure were not, in this case, numerous or\r\ngreat. The sheep-walks and cowdowns were all of them stinted by\r\n‘yardlands’ in the arable fields: there was not, perhaps, one unstinted\r\ncommon on these hills. They were, formerly, many of them, or all of\r\nthem, occupied by leasehold tenants for three lives renewable. A\r\nspecies of tenancy I have not met before. Many of these leaseholds had\r\nfallen in. The removal of those which remained, was” (_sic_: he means,\r\nof course, “removed”) “the main obstacle of inclosure.”\r\n\r\nBecause the number of Acts for Enclosure gradually increases through\r\nthe eighteenth century, and reaches its maximum at the opening of\r\nthe nineteenth century, it has been hastily assumed by some that the\r\nprocess of enclosure was similarly accelerated. But it is on _a priori_\r\ngrounds at least as probable that there was no acceleration in the rate\r\nof extinction of common fields, only a gradual change in the prevailing\r\nmethod of procedure.\r\n\r\nThus very few Acts of Enclosure are extant previous to 1727, the\r\nyear in which Edward Lawrence recommends to Stewards and Landlords a\r\nvigorous enclosure campaign. That that campaign was being carried on\r\nat the time can be shown by two contemporary extracts from writers\r\non opposite sides. The Rev. John Laurence of Yelvertoft, in the “New\r\nSystem of Agriculture,” 1726, writes:--\r\n\r\n“The great quantities of ground that have been of late and are daily\r\ninclosing, and the increase of Rent that is everywhere made by those\r\nwho do inclose, sufficiently demonstrate the benefit and use of\r\nInclosures. In the Bishopric of Durham nine parts in ten are already\r\ninclosed”[79] (p. 45).\r\n\r\n [79] This statement is confirmed by the Board of Agriculture reporter:\r\n “In this county the lands, or common fields of townships, were for\r\n the most part inclosed soon after the Restoration.” (Joseph Granger,\r\n “Agriculture of Durham,” 1794.)\r\n\r\nJohn Cowper, in “Inclosing Commons and Common fields is contrary to the\r\ninterest of the Nation” says:--“I myself within these 30 years past”\r\n(_i.e._, 1702–1732), “have seen above twenty Lordships or Parishes\r\ninclosed ... I have been informed by an eminent Surveyor that one third\r\nof all the land of England has been inclosed within these 80 years.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps what the eminent Surveyor said to John Cowper is not very\r\nconvincing evidence. But in considering the estimate of the amount\r\nof enclosure in the “last 80 years,” _i.e._, from 1652, the first\r\nyear of peace after the Civil War, to 1732, the time when John Cowper\r\nwrote, we have to bear in mind, firstly, that there was an important\r\nenclosure movement going on in the Commonwealth period; and secondly,\r\nthat in 1660, with the Restoration, the country gentry came by their\r\nown again. The King’s ministers during the reigns of Charles II., James\r\nII., William III. and Anne would scarcely have dared, even if they had\r\ndesired, to check any proceedings on the part of landowners, with the\r\nobject of raising rents. The whole policy of Parliament was, in fact,\r\nin sympathy with this object, as may be seen from all the legislature\r\naffecting agriculture.\r\n\r\nFor the first part of this period there is further evidence of\r\nthe progress of enclosure in John Houghton’s “Collection for the\r\nImprovement of Husbandry and Trade.” In repeated issues he strongly\r\nadvocates Enclosure; in that for September 8, 1681, he says: “Oh that I\r\nhad sufficient influence to put it” (_i.e._, a General Enclosure Act)\r\n“to the trial, if it did not succeed I’d be content not to be drunk\r\nthis seven years” ... “Witness the many enclosures that have of late\r\nbeen made, and that people are daily on gog on making” (pp. 15, 16). It\r\nwill be remembered that a General Enclosure Act for Scotland was passed\r\nin 1695.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is clear that the Parliamentary enclosure of a given\r\nparish indicates that the lord of the manor, or principal landlord, had\r\nnot secured such a complete or preponderating influence over the parish\r\nas to enable him to effect an enclosure without an Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCLOSURE BY YEOMEN.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, on the other hand, it does not appear that the absence of\r\nany lord of the manor, or of any single landowner superior in wealth\r\nto the others in the parish was favourable, through the seventeenth,\r\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to the continuance of common\r\nfields, except where many of the properties were extremely small.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, in Elmstone\r\nHardwicke, while desiring themselves to enclose the parish, discourage\r\nenclosure by the tenants on their own account, by raising the rents\r\nto a prohibitive extent. Similarly Edward Lawrence in 1727, while\r\nurging, as we have seen, the steward to procure a general enclosure\r\nof his lord’s manor, declares that it is the duty of the steward,\r\nparticularly if his lord is the owner of the Great Tithe, to prevent\r\ngradual enclosure by yeomen--“He should be ever on his watch to prevent\r\n(if possible) the Freeholders inclosing any part of their land in the\r\ncommon fields (Article xxiv.).” “Partial enclosure should never be\r\npermitted without a general agreement to do the whole.”\r\n\r\nThe objection of the Tithe Owner to enclosures in the common fields\r\nwas that by increasing the pasture, and decreasing the arable area,\r\nthey diminished the produce of grain and so diminished the tithe. John\r\nHoughton (September 16, 1681, p. 16) also refers to the objection of\r\nthe tithe owning clergy to enclosure. And this objection was probably\r\none of the strongest forces against enclosure at that time.\r\n\r\nAgain, going back a century and a quarter, John Norden’s “Book of\r\nSurveying,” published about 1600, in one place recommends general\r\nenclosure, on the ground that “one acre enclosed is woorth one and a\r\nhalf in Common, if the ground be fitting thereto” (Book III., p. 97),\r\nin another declares “Also enclosures of common fields, or meddowes\r\nin part, by such as are most powerful and mighty, without the Lord’s\r\nlicence, and the Tenants’ assents, is more than may be permitted”\r\n(_ibid._, p. 96).\r\n\r\nThe reason of course is, firstly, that the holder of lands in common\r\nfields or common meadows, who fenced his holding, or parts of it,\r\nthereby prevented the other holders from exercising their rights of\r\npasturing their cattle upon the fenced portions, without giving up his\r\nrecognised right to pasture cattle on his neighbours’ holdings, very\r\nlikely indeed turning out all the more cattle in the summer and autumn,\r\nbecause better supplied with winter feed; and, secondly, because the\r\nshade of his hedges, if he set quickset hedges, injured his neighbours’\r\ncrops. In “Select pleas in the Manorial Courts” we find numerous cases\r\nof complaints against manorial tenants for attempting to make hedges,\r\nbanks, or such barriers.\r\n\r\nAt Bledlow, in Northamptonshire, “it is presented that John Le Pee\r\nhas unlawfully thrown up a bank” in 1275 (p. 23). In Hemingford\r\n(Huntingdon) that “William Thomas Son has planted willows in the bank\r\nunlawfully” in 1278 (p. 90), and in the same manor “Elias Carpenter\r\nhas wrongfully planted trees on a boundary” (p. 92). In Weedon Beck\r\n(Northamptonshire) in 1296 “Walter Mill complains of John Brockhole and\r\nsays that he has raised a wall and hedge between their tenements to his\r\ndamage.”\r\n\r\nOne is tempted to associate the early and complete enclosure of Kent,\r\nwithout Acts of Parliament, with the proverbial wealth and importance\r\nof the Kentish yeomen, and the custom of Gavelkind (_i.e._, the equal\r\ninheritance of landed property by all sons), which necessarily tended\r\nto multiply small properties.\r\n\r\nWilliam Marshall’s description of the enclosure of the Vale of\r\nPickering, the most fertile part of the North Riding of Yorkshire,\r\noccupying the southern slopes of the Yorkshire Wolds, shows a similar\r\nassociation. In “Rural Economy of Yorkshire,” published in 1788, we\r\nread:--“A century ago the marginal townships lay perhaps entirely open,\r\nand there are vestiges of common fields in the area of the vale. The\r\nWest Marshes, church property, have been longer under inclosure; and\r\nthe central townships were probably inclosed long before those of the\r\nmargin; the soils of that part being adapted to grass; and while the\r\nsurrounding country lay open, grass land was of singular value. At\r\npresent the entire vale may be said to be in a state of inclosures (p.\r\n17).\r\n\r\n“Lands are much in the hands of small owners, in general, in the\r\noccupation of yeomanry; a circumstance, this, which it would be\r\ndifficult to equal in so large a district” (p. 19).\r\n\r\nHe notices (p. 20) that it was the custom to divide lands among all the\r\nchildren, and (p. 24) that the custom of sale of tenant right existed.\r\n\r\n“In the present century, more especially in the last fifty years,\r\nenclosure has made a rapid progress.... In my own remembrance more than\r\nhalf the vale lay open” (p. 50).\r\n\r\nThe township of Pickering itself lay open at the beginning of the\r\ncentury. It then had 2376 acres of common field arable, stinted\r\npastures, and 3700 acres of common. “The common fields and common\r\nmeadows have been gradually contracting by amicable changes and\r\ntransfers, and are now, in a manner, wholly inclosed. The stinted\r\npastures have, at different times, been inclosed ‘by commission,’\r\nnamely, by the unanimous reference to arbitrators.”[80]\r\n\r\n [80] An older description of piecemeal enclosure is given by John\r\n Houghton: “Would they who plough in champain grounds but change their\r\n little parcels; would they who have 6 or 8 acres together make a\r\n ditch of 6 or 7 foot wide and deep, and fill it if they would with\r\n water, and carry away the bank that it might not be thrown in again,\r\n hedges might chance to thrive, and in 2 years (tho’ they to please the\r\n people might at certain times lay it open) they would raise more money\r\n than they use to do in six.” (Collections, September 16th, 1681, p.\r\n 16.) This gives me a pretty fair idea both of the profit and of the\r\n unpopularity of such enclosure at the time.\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said, that the Parliamentary enclosure of a given\r\nparish indicates that the manorial authority was exercised during a\r\nlong period antecedent to the enclosure, to prevent gradual enclosure\r\nby individual tenants; and that the existence of important rights\r\nand properties belonging to the lord of the manor prevented a common\r\nagreement to enclose by the actual cultivators of the soil from being\r\nreached and put into execution.\r\n\r\nIt may also be noticed that in a parish or township where there is no\r\none principal landlord, but a number of landowners owning moderate\r\nproperties, there is comparatively little likelihood of the net profit\r\nof an Enclosure Act seeming to any one owner worth the trouble of\r\ninitiating a movement to promote one; and a comparatively greater\r\nlikelihood of some owner or owners being found disposed, from private\r\ngrudges or on public grounds, to oppose the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThis distribution of property in a common field parish increases the\r\nprobability that enclosure will proceed in a piecemeal fashion, instead\r\nof by an Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCLOSURE UNDER THE GENERAL ACTS OF 1886 AND 1840.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 a general Act (c. 115) was passed “to facilitate the Inclosure\r\nof Open and Arable Fields in England and Wales.” By this Act two-thirds\r\nin number and value of the proprietors of lands and common rights\r\nin Arable Common Fields could appoint Commissioners for Enclosure,\r\nprovided such fields were not within ten miles of the centre of\r\nLondon, or three miles from the centre of some town of over 100,000\r\ninhabitants, or within certain smaller distances of smaller towns.\r\nEnclosure so effected was only recorded locally. Awards had to be\r\ndeposited in the parish churches; but no confirming Act was needed. If\r\nseven-eighths in number and value of the proprietors were agreed upon\r\nenclosure, it was not necessary for them even to appoint Commissioners,\r\nif they could come to an agreement as to the redistribution of\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 an amending Act (c. 31) was passed, providing that persons who\r\ntook possession of the allotments awarded them in enclosures under the\r\nAct of 1836 must be deemed to have waived the right of appeal from the\r\naward. The scope of the Act of 1836 was also extended to Lammas meadows.\r\n\r\nAs these Acts were in operation from 1836 to 1845, the enclosures\r\neffected by special Acts of Parliament during this period must have\r\nbeen greatly outnumbered by those effected during that period without\r\nbeing recorded by the central Government. Between 1845 and 1852 the\r\nenclosure of lands which were neither commonable all the year round\r\nnor subject to any common rights not regulated by a stint, could be\r\neffected by the Enclosure Commissioners without being reported to\r\nParliament; but after 1852 the Enclosure Commissioners had to report\r\nall their proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCLOSURE IN CORN-GROWING AND PASTORAL DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\nThe arable common fields, and in consequence the commonable meadows\r\nwith intermixed ownership, which were situated in districts\r\npredominantly pastoral, tended, other things being equal, to be divided\r\nand enclosed earlier than the common fields in the predominantly\r\ncorn-growing districts. For this there are various reasons:--\r\n\r\nFirstly, as may be seen from the maps of Castor and Ailesworth, of\r\nLaxton, of Braunton (p. 250), or of any maps of any common-field\r\nparishes, piecemeal enclosure tends to begin in the arable fields (_a_)\r\nclose to the village, and (_b_) on the outermost margin of the fields.\r\nThe greater the extent of the fields, the longer, _ceteris paribus_,\r\nwill it be before piecemeal enclosure completely obliterates them.\r\n\r\nSecondly, enclosure in a pastoral district does not arouse the same\r\nresentment and popular resistance that it does in a corn-growing\r\ndistrict. This is easily seen from all the controversial writings\r\nof the whole period during which enclosure has been a matter of\r\ncontroversy, up to about the middle of the nineteenth century. It was\r\nnot enclosure as enclosure that offended, but enclosure as causing,\r\nor as being intended to result in, the laying down of arable land in\r\ngrass; as being, in the words of Joseph Bentham of Kettering, “the\r\ninhuman practices of madded and irreligious depopulators”[81] which\r\nrobbed the king of subjects and the country of corn and cattle. Those\r\nwho enclosed were “monsters of men, dispeoplers of towns, ruiners of\r\nthe commonwealth as far as in them lyeth, occasioners of beggars and\r\nbeggery, cruell inclosiers, whose Adamantine hearts no whit regard\r\nthe cries of so many distressed ones.”[82] Such denunciation would be\r\nout of place, and the passions which gave rise to it would never have\r\narisen, in a predominantly pastoral district, because there would be\r\nin such a district comparatively few persons thrown out of employment\r\neven if the enclosure were of the arable fields only; and because it is\r\nscarcely possible that while enclosure of the arable fields was going\r\non, there would not be simultaneous enclosure of waste land, which\r\nwould have to be repeatedly ploughed and tilled even if the intention\r\nwere to ultimately convert it into permanent pasture. In other words,\r\nwhile enclosure in a predominantly corn-growing district is associated\r\nwith “depopulation,” in a pastoral district it is associated with\r\nincreased employment, increased local population, a larger production\r\nof food, and on the whole increased local prosperity. Thus, though\r\nthere was a rebellion in Devon and Cornwall in 1549, the same year\r\nas Ket’s rebellion, enclosure was not one of the complaints of the\r\nrebels. And this was not because enclosure had not begun in Devon and\r\nCornwall, because, as a matter of fact, enclosure had advanced further\r\nin Devon and Cornwall than in most other counties. The attitude of\r\nthe Cornishmen is thus expressed by Carew:--“They fal everywhere from\r\nCommons to Inclosure, and partake not of some Eastern Tenants envious\r\ndispositions, who will sooner prejudice their owne present thrift,\r\nby continuing this mingle-mangle, than advance the Lords expectant\r\nbenefit, after their terme expired.”[83]\r\n\r\n [81] “The Society of the Saints,” p. 67.\r\n\r\n [82] “The Society of the Saints,” p. 98.\r\n\r\n [83] Carew, “Cornwall” (1600), p. 30.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there was, during one period in the sixteenth century, a law\r\nspecially guarding the corn-growing districts from enclosure, from\r\nwhich other districts were exempt.\r\n\r\nThe Statute 7 Henry VIII., c. 1, was the Depopulation Act in force\r\nfor the 20 years 1516–1536. It derives special importance from the\r\nInquisition into Enclosures which followed its enactment, in 1517. It\r\napplies only to parishes “Whereof the more part was or were used and\r\noccupied to tillage and husbandrie”; and it required the land to be\r\ntilled “after the maner and usage of the countrey where the seyd land\r\nlyeth.” This restriction drops out of the next Depopulation Act, 27\r\nHenry VIII., c. 22, passed in the year 1536.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LELAND’S ITINERARY\r\n\r\n  Map of England and Wales showing Leyland’s route, with:\r\n      Moor, Fen, Marsh, Forest or Heath.\r\n      Enclosed.\r\n      Champion.\r\n      Cultivated and probably open.\r\n  Scale 1:5,000,000 or 1 inch = 79 Stat. miles.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1536 Leland, the King’s Antiquary, began his Itinerary,\r\nwhich lasted till 1542. Whether in consequence of special instructions\r\nor not, he almost everywhere notes the condition of the country he\r\ntraverses with regard to enclosure. A summary of his observations\r\nis shown in the form of a map; Devon, Cornwall, West Somerset,\r\nSouth Wales, Hereford, Worcester, the north-west of Warwick, South\r\nLancashire, the country round Southampton, and near Hampton Court, with\r\nparts of Yorkshire, are shown to be the most enclosed districts which\r\nare described; and the districts described by Leland as champaign are\r\nthose which were later largely enclosed by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe general movement of agricultural progress, it may safely be\r\nassumed, up to Leland’s time, was from the south-east of England\r\nnorthwards and westwards. The extreme south-east corner was certainly\r\nvery early enclosed, as one would naturally expect, but we also find\r\nremote western districts, where one would naturally expect to find old\r\ncustoms linger comparatively late, precede the central districts in the\r\nabandonment of the “village community,” by many years.[84]\r\n\r\n [84] How long the enclosure of certain western counties preceded\r\n the enclosure of the east midlands, is shown by comparing the two\r\n following extracts. Of the former, Joseph Lee, in “A Plea for\r\n Regulated Inclosure,” published 1656, asks, “Are not many places in\r\n England, Essex, Hereford, Devonshire, Shropshire, Worcester, wholly\r\n enclosed?” (p. 31). Of the latter the “General Report on Enclosures,”\r\n published 152 years later, “A village of farmers and labourers\r\n surrounding a church and environed by three or four and in a few cases\r\n by five open fields, form the spectacle of Cambridge, Huntingdon,\r\n and Northampton shires, as much as on the Loire and on the plains of\r\n Moscow” (p. 25).\r\n\r\nWhether much of the enclosure which Leland saw in 1536 had been the\r\nwork of the previous twenty years, it is of course impossible to\r\nsay; but making any reasonable allowance for progress in hedging\r\nand ditching in the western counties where agriculture was mainly\r\npastoral during those twenty years, and assuming that the Act of 1516\r\nhad effectually stopped enclosure in that period in the corn-growing\r\ndistricts, one can hardly resist coming to the conclusion that if\r\nLeland had made his journey in 1516 he would then also have found\r\nenclosure most advanced in those districts which were most enclosed in\r\n1536.\r\n\r\nWhat we have, then, to ask is whether the priority of enclosure in the\r\nwestern counties is to be attributed entirely to the fact of their\r\nbeing devoted more to grass and less to tillage, or whether there\r\nwas some difference in the primitive village community of the west\r\nwhich caused cultivated land to pass more easily into the condition\r\nof exclusive ownership and separate use. Obviously we must look for\r\nthe answer to this question beyond the boundaries of England. To\r\nunderstand the differences between the village life of those parts of\r\nEngland which were once the Danelagh, Mercia and Wessex, from those\r\nwhich were then West Wales and Strathclyde, which may be regarded as at\r\nleast semi-Celtic, we must examine the purely Celtic type of village\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nBut it must also be noticed that there is one characteristic feature of\r\nthe typical English village community, namely the importance attached\r\nto the right of common pasturage on the fallow field, and in the\r\nother arable fields after harvest, which would probably never have\r\ndeveloped in any part of the country where only a small proportion of\r\nthe land was ploughed. There would be too little profit and too much\r\ninconvenience attached to the exercise of the right for it to have a\r\nchance of being established, or if established, of persisting.\r\n\r\nLastly, it seems to me impossible to account for the perfect definition\r\nof the two boundaries between parishes early enclosed, without special\r\nActs, and parishes enclosed late by special Acts, the one in the\r\nsouth-east, passing through Suffolk, Essex, and between Surrey and\r\nKent, and the other in the south-west, passing through Somerset and\r\nDorset, except on the assumption that the enclosure movement beginning\r\nin these two corners of England, was suddenly checked when it had\r\nreached the limits indicated, by the Tudor series of Depopulation\r\nActs, and by the Inquisitions and other measures taken to enforce them.\r\nThese Acts specially stipulated for the continuance of the ancient\r\ncustomary methods of tillage. A summary of their provisions which\r\naffect enclosure will be found in Appendix D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nRUN-RIG AND COMMON FIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar fact that the early open field system of agriculture\r\nof Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, known as run-rig or rundale, differed\r\nin some important features from the common field system of England.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact suggests a series of questions with regard to the\r\nrelationships between common field and run-rig; whether, for instance,\r\nthe more complex common field system was evolved from the more simple\r\nand primitive run-rig system; or supposing the two not connected,\r\nwhether a boundary can be defined on one side of which the early\r\nagriculture was of the English type and on the other of the Celtic\r\ntype; and again, if so, which parts of England lie on the Celtic side\r\nof the boundary, and which, if any, of Wales and Scotland lie on the\r\nEnglish side.\r\n\r\nObviously before considering such questions it is necessary to have a\r\nclear grasp of the nature of run-rig, and of the differences between it\r\nand the English system.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1695 the Scotch Parliament passed an Act allowing anyone\r\n“coterminous heritor” owning a share in a “commonty” to have his\r\nportion separate from the rest, and to enclose it; and a series of\r\ncases established a defined system of computing the share of the\r\n“commonty” to which the lord of the manor as such was entitled in\r\nlieu of manorial rights. This caused the process of the separation\r\nof intermixed properties in open fields to proceed without the\r\nintervention of special Acts of Parliament, except for Royal burghs.\r\nAlso while in England under Enclosure Acts or agreements to enclose\r\nthe three processes of (_a_) the separation of intermixed and\r\nintercommonable properties, (_b_) the separation of intermixed and\r\nintercommonable holdings, and (_c_) the hedging or fencing of the\r\nseparated properties, were accomplished by one continuous series of\r\nactions on the part of those concerned, in Scotland it was otherwise.\r\nThe separation of properties where necessary was first accomplished,\r\nand for long afterwards the system of run-rig was followed by groups\r\nof tenants on the same estate. After run-rig had been abandoned, the\r\nseparate holdings remained open and unenclosed, and the process of\r\nbuilding dykes or planting hedges was carried out at a later date, and\r\nby slow degrees.\r\n\r\nThe abandonment of run-rig was general, according to the reports to\r\nthe Board of Agriculture, in the lowlands of Scotland about the year\r\n1730. In the county of Perth up to the year 1744 “the land was always\r\noccupied in run-rigg, either by the different tenants on the same farm,\r\nand sometimes by coterminous heritors. The houses were in clusters for\r\nthe mutual protection of the inhabitants.” (James Robertson, D.D.,\r\n“Agriculture of the Southern District of Perth,” 1794, pp. 22, 23.)\r\nIn the northern and Highland counties the transition was naturally\r\nlater. Sir John Sinclair (“General View of the Agriculture of the\r\nNorthern Counties and Islands of Scotland”) describes the cultivated\r\nland of the Islands as being open almost everywhere, except in the\r\ncase of the “mains” or manor farms, the glebe lands, and the farms\r\nof a few principal tacksmen. Of Caithness he says, “The greater part\r\nof the arable land in this county is occupied by small farmers who\r\npossess it in _run-rig_, or in _rig and rennal_, as it is here termed,\r\nsimilar to the common fields of England, a system peculiarly hostile\r\nto improvement” (p. 207). But in the Orkneys “Much of the land that\r\nformerly lay in the state known in Scotland under the name of run-rig\r\nland has been divided, but much still remains in the same situation”\r\n(p. 227); and the process of enclosing had begun even in the Shetlands\r\n(p. 252).\r\n\r\nTurning westwards, we find that in the inner Hebrides 1850 was the\r\ndate at which the run-rig system finally died out, in a manner and\r\nunder conditions which will demand further attention. But it survived\r\nin the Outer Hebrides to a considerably later date. A very full and\r\ninteresting description by Mr. Alexander Carmichael is given in\r\nSkene’s “Celtic Scotland,” Vol. III. chapter x.\r\n\r\n“Old systems are tenacious. They linger long among a rural people and\r\nin remote places. Of these is the land system of run-rig (Mor Barann)\r\nwhich characterises more or less the land system of the Western Isles.\r\nThe outer Hebrides are called the Long Island. They are a series of\r\nislands 119 miles in length, and varying from half-a-mile to twenty\r\nmiles in breadth. This kite-like chain of forty inhabited and upwards\r\nof a hundred and fifty uninhabited islands contains a population of\r\n40,000. Much of this land is held by extensive tacksmen on leases (Fir\r\nBaile), and there being no intermediate tenantry, the rest of the land\r\nis occupied by small tenants at will without leases. These number\r\n4,500, the majority of whom fish as well as farm.\r\n\r\n“The country is divided into townlands of various extent. The arable\r\nland (Fearann Grainsich) occupied by the small tenants of these\r\ntownlands is worked in three ways--as crofts wholly, as crofts and\r\nrun-rig combined, and as run-rig wholly. In Lewis and Harris the arable\r\nland is wholly divided into crofts: in Uist and Barra the arable land\r\nis divided in part into crofts, and in part worked in run-rig; while\r\nin the townlands of Hosta, Coolas Paipil, and the island of Heisgeir\r\nin North Uist, the arable land is worked exclusively upon the run-rig\r\nsystem of share and share alike. The grazing land of the tenants of\r\neach townland throughout the Long Island is held in common (in Lewis\r\ncalled Comhpairt).\r\n\r\n“The soil varies from pure sand to pure moss. Along the Atlantic there\r\nis a wide plain of sandy soil called _Machair_. This merges into a\r\nmixture of sand and moss (Breacthalamh, or mottled soil), which again\r\nmerges into pure moss (Mointeach) towards the Minch. As the soil is\r\ndry and sandy, if the summer is dry the crop is light. On the other\r\nhand, if the summer is moist the crop is heavy and good. In order\r\nthat all may have an equal chance, the _Machair_ belonging to them\r\nis equally divided among the tenants of the township. Obviously the\r\nman who is restricted to his croft has fewer advantages than the man\r\nwho, together with his croft, has his share of the _Machair_, and\r\nstill fewer advantages than the man who has, rig for rig with his\r\nneighbours, the run of the various soils of his townland, which gives\r\nname to the system. Consequently a wet or dry season affects the tenant\r\nof the croft system more than the tenant of the combined system, and\r\nthe tenant of the combined system more than the tenant of the run-rig\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n“The townland of Hosta is occupied by four, Ceolas Paipil by six, and\r\nthe island of Heisgeir by twelve tenants. Towards the end of autumn,\r\nwhen harvest is over, and the fruits of the year have been gathered\r\nin, the constable calls a meeting of the tenants of the townland for\r\nNabachd (neighbourliness). They meet, and having decided upon the\r\nportion of land to be put under green crop next year, they divide it\r\ninto shares according to the number of tenants in the place, and the\r\nnumber of shares in the soil they respectively possess. Thereupon\r\nthey cast lots, and the share which falls to a tenant he retains for\r\nthree years. A third of the land under cultivation is thus divided\r\nevery year. Accordingly the whole cultivated land of the townland\r\nundergoes revision every three years. Should a man get a bad share he\r\nis allowed to choose his share in the next division. The tenants divide\r\nthe land into shares of uniform size. For this purpose they use a rod\r\nseveral yards long, and they observe as much accuracy in measuring\r\ntheir land as a draper in measuring his cloth. In marking the boundary\r\nbetween shares, a turf (Torc) is dug up and turned over the line of\r\ndemarcation. The _torc_ is then cut along the middle, and half is taken\r\nby the tenant on one side, and half by the tenant on the other side,\r\nin ploughing the subsequent furrow; similar care being afterwards\r\nexercised in cutting the corn along the furrow. The tenant’s portion of\r\nthe run-rig is called Cianag, and his proportion of the grazing ground\r\nfor every pound he pays Coir-sgoraidh.\r\n\r\n“There are no fences round the fields. The crop being thus exposed\r\nto injury from the cattle grazing along the side, the people have\r\na protecting rig on the margin of the crop. This rig is divided\r\ntransversely into shares, in order to subject all tenants to equal\r\nrisks.... Occasionally, and for limited bits of ground, the people\r\ntill, sow, and reap in common, and divide the produce into shares and\r\ndraw lots. This is called _Comachadh_, promiscuous. The system was not\r\nuncommon in the past, though now nearly obsolete.\r\n\r\n“In making their own land arrangements for the year, the tenants set\r\napart a piece of land towards the support of the poor....\r\n\r\n“In reclaiming moor-land the tenants divide the ground into narrow\r\nstrips of five feet wide or thereby. These strips, called lazy-beds\r\n(Feannagan, from feann, to scarify), the tenants allot among themselves\r\naccording to their shares or crofts. The people mutually encourage one\r\nanother to plant as much of this ground as possible. In this manner\r\nmuch waste ground is reclaimed and enhanced in value, the ground\r\nhitherto the home of the stonechat, grouse, snipe and sundew, is\r\nmade to yield luxuriant crops of potatoes, corn, hay and grass. Not\r\nunfrequently, however, these land reclamations are wrested without\r\nacknowledgment from those who made them.\r\n\r\n“The sheep, cattle and horses of the townland graze together, the\r\nspecies being separate. A tenant can only keep stock conformably to his\r\nshare in the soil. He is however at liberty to regulate the proportions\r\nof the different kinds, provided that his total stock does not exceed\r\nhis total grazing rights. He can keep a greater number of one species\r\nand a corresponding smaller number of another. Or he can keep a greater\r\nnumber of the young, and a corresponding less number of the old of the\r\nsame species, or the reverse. About Whitsuntide, when the young braird\r\nappears, the people remove their sheep and cattle to the grazing ground\r\nbehind the arable land. This is called clearing the townland. The\r\ntenants bring forward their stock (Leibhidh) and a souming (Sumachadh)\r\nis made. The _Leibhidh_ is the tenant’s stock, the _Sumachadh_ the\r\nnumber he is entitled to graze in common with his neighbours. Should\r\nthe tenant have a croft, he is probably able to graze some extra stock\r\nthereon, though this is demurred to by his neighbours. Each ‘penny’ of\r\narable lands has grazing rights of so many soums. Neither, however, is\r\nthe extent of land in the penny, nor the number of animals in the soum\r\nuniformly the same.”\r\n\r\nA soum consists of a cow and her progeny; in some places the cow and\r\nher calf only: in some a cow, her calf, her one-year-old progeny\r\n(called a _stirk_) and her two-year-old _quey_; in other places again,\r\nthe cow, calf, stirk, quey and a three-year-old heifer. At four years\r\nold the heifer becomes a cow, and so originates a fresh soum.\r\n\r\nIn making souming calculations, it is assumed that one cow is equal\r\nto two queys or to four stirks or to eight calves, or to one heifer\r\nand one stirk. Also one cow is equal to eight sheep, or to twelve\r\nhoggs (one-year-old sheep) or to sixteen lambs or to sixteen geese.\r\nOne mature horse is equal to two cows; also to eight foals, or to four\r\none-year-old colts or fillies, or to two two-year-olds, or to one\r\nthree-year-old and one colt or filly. The cow is entitled to her calf;\r\nand if one tenant has two cows without calves they are entitled to take\r\none stirk instead.\r\n\r\nThose tenants who are found at the souming to have overstock must\r\neither buy grazing from a tenant who has understock or may be allowed\r\nby the community to let the overstock remain on the grass till he\r\ncan dispose of it. In that case payment must be made, according to a\r\nrecognised code, into a common fund which is used to buy bulls or tups\r\nor for some other common purpose. The souming is amended at Lammas, and\r\nagain at Hallowtide.\r\n\r\nIn Lewis and Harris similar arrangements with regard to stock obtain\r\namong the _crofters_, the amount of stock allowed to each crofter being\r\nregulated according to the rent paid.\r\n\r\nDuring the early summer the herds are put at night into enclosures,\r\naccording to the species, and two tenants, chosen in rotation, keep\r\nwatch to prevent them from straying over the open fields. If they\r\nescape, the watchmen are fined and have to make any damage good, but\r\nthe fines, and the amount assessed for damages, both go into the common\r\nfund.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, the tillage being finished, the people go to the hill\r\ngrazing with their flocks. The scene is vividly described by Mr.\r\nCarmichael, the general excitement, the men shouting directions, the\r\nwomen knitting and chatting, the children scampering about. Sheep lead\r\nthe procession, cattle come next, the younger ones preceding the older,\r\nthe horses follow. Implements and materials are carried to repair the\r\nsummer huts. When the grazing ground is reached the huts are repaired,\r\nfires lit, and food cooked. The people bring forward their stock into\r\nan enclosure, and the constable and another man stand at the gate of\r\nthe enclosure and count each man’s stock separately to see that he has\r\nbrought only his proper souming. Then the cattle are turned out to\r\ngraze, and the “Shealing Feast” is celebrated by the singing of hymns\r\nand the eating of cheese. The summer huts are of a beehive shape, and\r\nare sometimes constructed of stone, and sometimes of turf and frail\r\nmaterials.[85]\r\n\r\n [85] The ruins of beehive huts all over Dartmoor, and of enclosures\r\n like Grimspound, are conceivably evidence of similar customs in\r\n Devonshire. Now, however, the care of the cattle pastured on Dartmoor\r\n by the occupiers of adjacent farms, is a distinct occupation. Those\r\n who follow it are called “Moor-men.”\r\n\r\nEach tenant under the run-rig system is responsible for his own rent\r\nonly. Formerly the rent was paid partly in money, partly in meal,\r\npartly in butter and cheese, and partly in cattle.\r\n\r\nThe common functionaries, the shepherd, cattleherd and marchkeeper,\r\nare paid by their co-tenants for their services in seaweed, land and\r\ngrazing. The business of the marchkeeper is to watch the open marches\r\nof the townland and prevent trespass. He may also have the duty of\r\nwatching the shore to see when the seaweed is cast upon it. Then he\r\nerects a pole with a bunch of seaweed at the end, and the people\r\ncome down to the shore to collect the weed for manure. No tenant is\r\npermitted to take seaweed till his neighbours arrive, unless the custom\r\nprevails of collecting the weed in common, dividing it into shares and\r\ncasting lots.\r\n\r\nWhen required by the proprietor or the people, the constable convenes a\r\nmeeting of the inhabitants. At such meetings the questions in dispute\r\nare settled, after full discussion, by votes; lots are drawn if the\r\nvotes are equal.\r\n\r\n“The closer the run-rig system is followed, the more are the unwritten\r\ncustoms and regulations observed. The more intelligent tenants regret a\r\ndeparture from them....\r\n\r\n“The houses of the tenants form a cluster. In parts of Lewis the houses\r\nare in a straight line called _Straid_, street, occasionally from one\r\nto three miles in length. They are placed in a suitable part of the\r\ntownland, and those of the tenants on the run-rig system are warm,\r\ngood and comfortable. These tenants carry on their farming operations\r\nsimultaneously, and not without friendly and wholesome rivalry, the\r\nenterprise of one stimulating the zeal of another....\r\n\r\n“Not the least pleasing feature in this semi-family system is the\r\nassistance rendered by their neighbours to a tenant whose work has\r\nfallen behind through accident, sickness, death, or other unavoidable\r\ncause....\r\n\r\n“Their mode of dividing the land and of equalising the stock may seem\r\nprimitive and complex to modern views, but they are not so to the\r\npeople themselves, who apply them amicably, accurately and skilfully.\r\nThe division of the land is made with care and justice. This is the\r\ninterest of all, no one knowing which place may fall to himself, for\r\nhis neighbour’s share may become his own three years hence.\r\n\r\n“Whatever may be the imperfections, according to modern notions, of\r\nthis very old semi-family system of run-rig husbandry, those tenants\r\nwho have least departed from it are the most comfortable in North Uist,\r\nand, accordingly, in the Outer Hebrides.”\r\n\r\nMr. Carmichael informs me that the whole of this description held good\r\nat least up to May, 1904.\r\n\r\nThe brief descriptions and other references to the run-rig system\r\nof the agricultural writers whom Sir John Sinclair and Arthur Young\r\nenlisted in the service of the Board of Agriculture at the end of the\r\neighteenth, and the beginning of the nineteenth century, are sufficient\r\nto show that in all essential features it was fundamentally identical\r\nin different parts of Scotland. Sir John Sinclair’s own description\r\nis meagre and unsympathetic: “Were there twenty tenants and as many\r\nfields, each tenant would think himself unjustly treated unless he\r\nhad a proportionate share in each. This causes treble labour, and as\r\nthey are perpetually crossing each other, they must be in a state of\r\nconstant quarrelling and bad neighbourhood. In order to prevent any of\r\nthe soil being carried to the adjoining ridge, each individual makes\r\nhis own ridge as high as possible, which renders the furrow quite bare,\r\nso that it produces no crop, while the accumulated soil in the middle\r\nof the ridge is never stirred deeper than the plough. The proprietors\r\nbegin to see the inconveniences of this system, and in general intend\r\nto remedy it, by dividing the land into regular farms.”[86]\r\n\r\n [86] “General View of the Agriculture of the Northern Counties and\r\n Highlands of Scotland,” p. 205.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously a description of run-rig in a state of decrepitude;\r\nthe communal spirit has died out of it, and apparently the practice\r\nof periodic redivision of the land has fallen into desuetude. In\r\nanother passage[87] we find a variation of the method of guarding the\r\ncrops which again, when compared with Mr. Carmichael’s description of\r\nthe “promiscuous rig,” appears to show the decay of the system. “The\r\ntenants have a miserable sort of fence, made of turf, which separates\r\ntheir arable land from the adjoining waste; but it requires constant\r\nrepairs, and when the corn is taken off the ground, is entirely\r\nneglected, and the country becomes one immense common, over which\r\nimmense numbers of cattle are straggling in search of food, greatly to\r\nthe injury of the soil.”\r\n\r\n [87] _Ibid._, p. 207. This passage and the next occur in the\r\n description of Caithness, but they appear to be intended to apply to\r\n the whole district.\r\n\r\nWilliam Marshall, the rival as an agricultural writer and bitter critic\r\nof Arthur Young, supplied the “General View of the Agriculture of the\r\nCentral Highlands of Scotland.” He supplies us with one significant\r\nhint, if we need it, with regard to the fundamental basis of run-rig:\r\n“Not the larger farms only, but each subdivision, though ever so\r\nminute, _whether ‘plow-gait,’ ‘half-plow,’ or ‘horse-gang,’_ has its\r\npittance of hill and vale, and its share of each description of land,\r\nas arable, meadow, green pasture and muir” (p. 29). By the way, even\r\nsmaller farms than the “horse-gang,” _i.e._, one quarter of the arable\r\nland which could be ploughed by a four-horse plough, together with the\r\ncorresponding proportion of meadow, pasture and moor, were to be found\r\non the Royal burghs where intermixed ownership was exempt from the\r\noperation of the Act of 1695. On these the smallest farms consisted of\r\na “horse’s foot” of land, _i.e._, one sixteenth part of a “plow-gait.”\r\n\r\nDr. James Robertson defines run-rig as “Two or three or perhaps four\r\nmen yoking their horses together in one plough, and having their ridges\r\nalternately in the same field, with a bank of unploughed land between\r\nthem, by way of march.”[88]\r\n\r\n [88] “Agriculture of the Southern Districts of Perth” (1794).\r\n\r\nJames McDonald, writing in 1811 a later report on the Agriculture of\r\nthe Hebrides, published in 1811, gives an account of the beginning\r\nof the disappearance of run-rig in those islands. “Mr. Maclean of\r\nColl insisted upon some of his tenants dividing among them the land\r\nwhich they formerly held in common, or run-rig, and which they were\r\naccustomed for ages to divide annually by lot, for the purposes of\r\ncultivation. They obeyed with great reluctance, and each tenant had\r\nhis own farm to himself. Three or four years’ experience has convinced\r\nthem now that their landlord acted wisely.... The same thing happened\r\non various other estates, and especially in Mull, Tyree and Skye”\r\n(p. 133). But the general disappearance of run-rig in these islands\r\ntook place about the middle of the nineteenth century, and was the\r\nconsequence of the temporary prosperity produced by the rise of\r\nthe kelp industry. This led to extreme subdivision of holdings by\r\nsub-letting, the body of small crofters so created relying in the main\r\nupon the kelp industry for a livelihood, and using their crofts as a\r\nsubsidiary means of subsistence (Skene, “Celtic Scotland,” Vol. III.,\r\nch. x.).\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the two essential features of run-rig are (1) that\r\nit is based upon co-aration, several farmers yoking their horses to\r\none plough, and tilling the land in partnership; just as the English\r\ncommon-field system was also based upon co-aration, with the difference\r\nthat in England, in general, at the time that co-aration was practised,\r\nthe plough was generally drawn by eight oxen instead of by four horses.\r\n\r\n(2) That run-rig has a special distinctive feature in the periodical\r\ndivision and re-division of the land, and that in the Hebrides, at\r\nleast, this feature survived after co-aration had become obsolete.[89]\r\nIn this respect the Scotch agricultural community resembles that of\r\nGreat Russia, where also the periodical re-division of the open fields,\r\nso as to make the shares proportional to the working power of each\r\nfamily, persists after co-aration has disappeared.\r\n\r\n [89] Mr. A. N. Palmer, in his important work, “A History of Ancient\r\n Tenures of Land in the Marches of N. Wales,” expresses the opinion\r\n that co-aration and the shifting of land disappeared simultaneously in\r\n North Wales, and had come to an end by the reign of Henry VI. (p. 36,\r\n note).\r\n\r\nThat throughout the British Isles, and indeed throughout Northern\r\nEurope, the earliest tillage of the soil by ploughs was accomplished by\r\nthe method of co-aration, scarcely admits of doubt; nor is it easy to\r\ndoubt that before the possibility of improving the crop by manure was\r\ndiscovered, there was no permanent occupation by one of the partners in\r\nthe ploughing, of any particular set of strips so ploughed.\r\n\r\nBut it is also obvious that whereas we know that in some places, as\r\nin the Hebrides and in Russia, the idea of common occupation of the\r\nland persisted, after co-aration had ceased, and displayed itself in\r\nthe form of periodic or occasional re-division of the arable land, it\r\nis equally possible for the permanent occupation of certain strips of\r\nland to be definitely allotted to some individuals, while the practice\r\nof co-aration is still persistent among other individuals of the same\r\ncommunity. In the latter case when individual cultivation begins, the\r\npeasant who drives his own plough team, drives it over the same set of\r\nstrips of land as had previously been ploughed by the common plough;\r\nhe feels more than ever that they are his own, and that he must guard\r\nthem against encroachment; though, perhaps, he is not averse, when\r\noccasion offers, to widen his strips at the expense of his neighbours.\r\nThe consequence is that by the time individual cultivation has entirely\r\nsuperseded co-operative ploughing in any particular village, freeholds\r\nand copyholds are definitely arranged as we know them in the English\r\ncommon fields. Particularly is this likely to be the case if a long\r\ninterval of time elapses between the first beginning of individual\r\nploughing and the last disappearance of combined ploughing.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand the practice of periodic re-allotment of the land\r\npersists up to the time when co-aration ceases, it will obviously be\r\nnatural for the peasants when they dissolve their plough-partnership,\r\nto allot their land to one another with some regard for convenience\r\nas well as equity. They will naturally--as Sir John Sinclair noticed\r\nthey did--allot to each household a share in each particular sort of\r\nsoil which had previously been cultivated in common, but each man’s\r\nshare in each field is likely to be allotted to him in one piece, or\r\nat least in a few, and not in a number of strips intermixed with those\r\nof his neighbours. Then when at a later period hedging and ditching\r\nbegin, each man has his land in a form convenient for enclosure; and\r\nby enclosing it he forms a series of irregular fields, roughly square,\r\nor when oblong, with the length not many times exceeding the width. No\r\nthrowing of the parish into the melting pot, either by a private Act of\r\nParliament or by a voluntary submission to a Commission, was necessary\r\nin order to effect enclosure.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, then, it is obvious that the great inequality of the\r\nholdings held by servile and semi-servile tenures from the time of\r\nDomesday onwards, was favourable to the creation of the conditions\r\nnecessary to make piecemeal enclosure difficult. The _socmanni_\r\nor _francigenae_, who held a whole carucate or ploughland apiece,\r\npresumably also had, as a rule, a whole ploughteam, and were able to\r\nplough for themselves, while their neighbours, who held yardlands and\r\nhalf-yardlands, _i.e._, one-quarter or one-eighth of a ploughland,\r\ncould only have their lands ploughed by the common village ploughs.\r\nAs soon as the _socmanni_ and _francigenae_ began to permanently\r\nimprove the soil, as for instance by marling, the beneficial results\r\nof which were believed in the eighteenth century to last for at least\r\ntwelve years, they would naturally become a practically insuperable\r\nobstacle not only to any re-division of the land, but also to any\r\nminor variation in the exact position of the ridges which comprised\r\nthe different holdings. Once one such holding was definitely located,\r\nthe fixing of all other holdings which were intermixed with it would\r\nfollow: every increase of certainty would be an encouragement to any\r\ngiven tenant to improve his land, and every expenditure of effort by a\r\ntenant on permanent improvement would be an additional motive to him to\r\nresist any changes in the position of his ridges.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the case of land first brought into cultivation\r\nat a later date, when servile tenures had become obsolete, by “tenants\r\nat will” of the lord of the manor, the assured continued occupation\r\nof a defined set of ridges in land so reclaimed would not arise, even\r\nif the original tenants practised co-aration; and if the original\r\ncultivators worked independently, of course no intermixture of holdings\r\nwould ever arise on such holdings.\r\n\r\nHence the very close connection between copyholds, _i.e._, the commuted\r\nservile tenures, and common fields, which was observed as long as\r\ncommon fields were numerous.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is clear that on _a priori_ grounds there are certain\r\ndefined conditions in which alone we can expect to find the peculiarly\r\nEnglish type of open-field arable, the type which most obstinately\r\nresists dissolution, persisting until destroyed by (_a_) the absorption\r\nof all properties into the hands of a single owner, or (_b_) a general\r\nvaluation and redistribution of properties and holdings. These are that\r\nthe land must originally have been tilled by the method of co-aration,\r\nand that co-aration must have persisted until after some at least of\r\nthe holdings had become a definite set of strips of land, the position\r\nof which was not shifted from year to year. These conditions, as\r\nSeebohm shows, are the characteristics of the typical English village\r\ncommunity. But they are not to be found in open arable fields of the\r\nCeltic type of run-rig; and they are not to be expected in lands first\r\nbrought into cultivation after the disappearance of serfdom.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore expect to find enclosure of arable land proceeding\r\neasily, without the necessity for special Acts of Parliament, and at\r\na comparatively early stage of social evolution, on the one hand in\r\nDevon and Cornwall, the counties bordering on Wales, and in Cumberland,\r\nWestmoreland and Lancashire; and on the other hand in districts like\r\nthe Weald of Surrey, Kent and Sussex.\r\n\r\nThat this inference agrees with the facts will be shown in detail.\r\n\r\nTraces of run-rig, however, both in the form of characteristic terms,\r\nand of records of local custom, are not confined entirely to the\r\ncounties within or near the borders of Wales or West Wales. The Act\r\n(1770 c. 59) for Matton in Lincolnshire has for its object to enclose\r\ncertain commons and “forty-five acres or thereabouts of antient\r\nToftheads and small Inclosures called the Town Rig.” To the Act for\r\nBarton in Westmoreland (1819 c. 83), which encloses “certain open\r\ncommon fields or town fields,” which mentions “the dales or parcels of\r\nland in the said common fields or town fields,” there is a parallel\r\nin the Act (1814 c. 284), for Gateshead in Durham to enclose “certain\r\ncommon or town fields, and other commonable lands and grounds.” These\r\nphrases are all reminiscent of the fact that lands held, or which had\r\npreviously been held, in run-rig in Scotland, or in rundale in Ireland,\r\nare known as town lands.[90]\r\n\r\n [90] “The Town Fields” indifferently with “The Common Fields” is the\r\n name by which the ancient arable area of Wrexham is called in old\r\n deeds, and the same name is applied to the ancient common fields in\r\n many places in North Wales. (See A. N. Palmer, “History of Ancient\r\n Tenures of Land in the Marches of North Wales,” pp. 1, 2.)\r\n\r\nMuch more striking, however, is the local custom at Stamford, described\r\nin the following passage by Arthur Young: “Lord Exeter has property\r\non the Lincoln side of Stamford, that seems held by some tenure of\r\nancient custom among the farmers, resembling the _rundale_ of Ireland.\r\nThe tenants divide and plough up the commons, and then lay them down\r\nto become common again; and shift the open fields from hand to hand\r\nin such a manner, that no man has the same land two years together;\r\nwhich has made such confusion that were it not for ancient surveys it\r\nwould now be impossible to ascertain the property” (“General View of\r\nthe Agriculture of Lincolnshire,” p. 27). William Marshall’s comment\r\nis perhaps worth adding: “In regard to commons, a similar custom has\r\nprevailed, and indeed still prevails, in Devonshire and Cornwall; and\r\nwith respect to _common fields_, the same practice under the name\r\nof ‘Run-rig’ formerly was common in the Highlands of Scotland, and,\r\nperhaps in more remote times, in Scotland in general.”\r\n\r\nLastly, it is to be noticed that there is no mention in any description\r\nof run-rig of the arable fields being used as a common pasture after\r\nharvest, or during a fallow year. We shall find later the same absence\r\nof this custom characteristic of English Common Field, from open arable\r\nfields in Cumberland, Westmoreland, Lancashire, Wales and Devonshire;\r\n_i.e._, from the Celtic part of England and Wales. This may, of course,\r\nbe a mere coincidence, and the true explanation may in each be that\r\nthe stubble was not needed for pasture. But in any case the absence\r\nof rights of pasture over arable fields removes a great obstacle to\r\npiecemeal enclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERY YEAR LANDS.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on Norfolk agriculture it is shown that the distinction\r\nbetween Infield and Outfield, which was characteristic of the\r\nagriculture of the Lothians, was also characteristic of the agriculture\r\nof Norfolk; and that a great part of the uninclosed intermixed arable\r\nland was not subject to rights of common, and was made to bear a crop\r\nevery year, such land being known as Every Year lands, Whole Year\r\nlands, or Infields.\r\n\r\nHere again we were obliged to look to Scotland for further light upon\r\nthe customs of an English county, but in this case we cannot attribute\r\nthe resemblance between the customs of Norfolk and the east of Scotland\r\nto a common Celtic influence. The hypothesis would be a difficult one,\r\nand a different explanation presents itself.\r\n\r\nSeebohm points out that the ancient characteristic agriculture of\r\nWestphalia, East Friesland, Oldenburg, North Hanover, Holland, Belgium,\r\nDenmark, Brunswick, Saxony and East Prussia, a vast area comprising\r\nall districts from which the Anglo-Saxon conquerors of Britain are\r\nbelieved by any historians to have come, is that known among German\r\nscholars as “Einfeldwirthschaft,” the “one field system.” Crops,\r\nusually of rye and buckwheat, are continually grown year after year,\r\nin the strips in the open fields, the fertility being maintained by\r\nmarling and the application of peat manure.[91]\r\n\r\n [91] “The English Village Community,” p. 372.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore natural to attribute the whole year or every year lands\r\nof Norfolk, and the infields of Scotland, alike, to the influence of\r\nSaxon, Anglian or Danish conquest and settlement. If it is asked why\r\nthe same agricultural feature was not more widely produced, the obvious\r\nanswer is that when people of different races are mixed together in the\r\noccupation of the same villages, it is by no means certain that the\r\nagricultural customs which will afterwards prevail will be those of\r\nthe conquerors, or of the race which is in the majority. The customs\r\nof the first occupiers had been modified by the environment, and had\r\nto some extent modified the environment, till something like harmony\r\nwas created. After a conquest by another race, if any of the conquered\r\nrace remain, the _easiest_ course is to continue the existing mode of\r\nhusbandry. It is more likely that the customs of the conquered race\r\nshould remain as the basis of the future practice, though altered to\r\nsome extent in form and more in spirit, than that the previous customs\r\nof the conquerors, which they had followed in other circumstances on a\r\ndifferent soil and amidst other surroundings, should be imposed on the\r\nconquered people.\r\n\r\nThe following are the Acts for places outside Norfolk which specify the\r\nexistence of Whole Year lands, Every Year lands, or Infields.\r\n\r\n1740, c. 19. Gunnerton, _Northumberland_. This Act is to enclose 1300\r\nacres of Ingrounds, and 1000 acres of Outgrounds.\r\n\r\n1752, c. 27. Enclosing Wytham on the Hill, Infield, _Lincolnshire_.\r\n\r\n1761, c. 32. Enclosing Norham Infields. Norham was nominally in\r\n_Durham_, but it is on the Scottish border.\r\n\r\n1807, c. 18. Herringswell, _Suffolk_. “Divers old inclosed meadow and\r\npasture grounds, and old inclosed whole year or every year arable\r\nlands, open or common fields, half year or shack lands, common meadows,\r\nheaths, warrens, fens, commons, and waste grounds.”\r\n\r\n1811, c. ccxix. Great Waddingfield c. Chilton and Great Coniard,\r\n_Suffolk_, “divers open fields called Whole Year lands and Half Year\r\nlands.”\r\n\r\n1813, c. 29. Icklingham, _Suffolk_. “Open and Common fields, Infields\r\nor Every Year lands, Common Meadows, Heaths, Commons and Wastes.”\r\n\r\n1819, c. 18. Yelling, _Huntingdon_, “Whole year lands.”\r\n\r\nFurther, Arthur Young (“Agriculture of Suffolk,” appendix, p. 217)\r\ntells us that the parish of Burnham, near Euston, in Suffolk, contained\r\nin 1764--\r\n\r\n  Infield arable, inclosed      381 acres,\r\n  Outfield arable              2626   ″\r\n  Meadow and Pasture            559   ″\r\n  Heath or Sheep-walk          1735   ″\r\n                               ────\r\n                      Total    5302\r\n                               ────\r\n\r\nAnd William Marshall (“General View of the Agriculture of the Central\r\nHighlands of Scotland,” 1794, p. 38) remarks: “The every year lands as\r\nthey are called, of _Gloucester_, may be said to be clean compared with\r\nthose of Breadalbane.” Now, William Marshall knew the agriculture of\r\nGloucestershire well; and he was an extremely accurate observer, and\r\nmore interested in the local variations of common field cultivation\r\nthan other agricultural writers of his time; his authority may\r\ntherefore be considered good enough to establish the existence of lands\r\nknown as every year lands in Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be noticed that Acts of Enclosure for Gloucester and\r\nOxford frequently specify, not “open and common fields” but “an open\r\nand common field,” perhaps of between two and three thousand acres;\r\nand further, as we have previously noted, the Board of Agriculture\r\nreporter for Oxfordshire says: “In divers uninclosed parishes the same\r\nrotation prevails over the whole of the open fields; but in others,\r\nthe more homeward or bettermost land is oftener cropped, or sometimes\r\ncropped every year.” Of Gloucestershire, William Marshall says: “In the\r\nneighbourhood of Gloucester are some extensive Common fields which have\r\nbeen cropped, year after year, during a century, or perhaps centuries,\r\nwithout the intervening of a whole year’s fallow. Hence they are called\r\nEvery Year’s land. Cheltenham, Deerhurst, and some few other townships,\r\nhave also their Every Year’s lands.” On these lands no regular\r\nsuccession of crops is observed, except that “a brown and a white\r\ncrop--pulse and corn--are cultivated in alternacy” (“Rural Economy of\r\nGloucestershire,” Vol. I., p. 65).\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested, further, that a four-year course, such as we have\r\nseen was customary in many places, might possibly have originated\r\nfrom the custom of cropping the land every year. The difficulties of\r\nmaintaining the fertility of the land, and of keeping it clean, under\r\nperennial crops, might very well have been found insuperable before\r\nthe introduction of turnip culture, and the natural remedy, suggested\r\nby the two-or three-year course in neighbouring parishes, would be a\r\nperiodic fallow. It is, however, so far as any evidence that can be\r\nsupplied from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries goes, equally\r\npossible that the four-year course was a modification of the three-year\r\ncourse, or that the two-, three-and four-years systems are all equally\r\nancient; and that the varying customs, not only of systems of tillage,\r\nbut also of occupation of meadow land and regulation of common of\r\npasture, as found in different parts of the country, have grown up in\r\neach district as the result of the inter-action of Keltic, Anglo-Saxon,\r\nand Norse tradition.\r\n\r\nIf we take this view, which appears to me antecedently probable, we can\r\nsee in the Midland or Mercian system a complete blend of Anglo-Saxon\r\nand Keltic custom, in which the specific features of both of the\r\noriginal strains are lost, and an intermediate, but perfectly distinct,\r\ntype of village community resulted. The Wessex system, both in its\r\nfeature of lot or rotation meadow, and in the customs of individual\r\ncultivation of land for common benefit, as in the sowing of clover by\r\neach occupier to be fed on by the village flock, compared with the\r\nMercian system, shows a much closer affinity with Keltic run-rig; while\r\nthe Norfolk customs are quite easily accounted for as the result of\r\na fresh infusion of Teutonic tradition, re-introducing the original\r\none-field system into villages where that system had previously been\r\nblended with Keltic custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCOMMON FIELDS IN NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain amount of light upon the question when the common field\r\nsystem lost its vitality, its advantages being completely overshadowed\r\nby its disadvantages, so that only the obstructive forces which we\r\nhave considered prevented its disappearance, is furnished by the fact\r\nthat the original settlers of New England, who presumably derived\r\ntheir ideas of agriculture from the eastern counties of England,\r\nreproduced in America a form of the English village community. No\r\ndoubt their poverty and early difficulties compelled them to revert\r\nto a further degree of dependence on mutual help, and so perhaps the\r\nform of community which they there established may have been of a more\r\nprimitive type than that which they had left behind, and allowance must\r\nbe made for this possibility; and also for the possibility of effects\r\nof the sojourn of the Pilgrim Fathers in Holland.\r\n\r\nThe following accounts of the New England common fields are taken from\r\ntwo papers by Mr. Herbert B. Adams:--\r\n\r\n“Vestiges of the old Germanic system of common fields are to be found\r\nin almost every ancient town in New England. In the town of Plymouth\r\nthere are to this day some 200 acres of Commons known as Town Lands.\r\nThis tract is largely forest, where villagers sometimes help themselves\r\nto wood in good old Teutonic fashion.... In the old town of Sandwich,\r\nnear Cape Cod, at the point where the ship canal was projected in 1880,\r\nthere is a little parcel of 130 acres known as the Town Neck. This is\r\nowned by a company of twenty-four proprietors, the descendants and\r\nheirs of the first settlers in the town, and this tract is managed to\r\nthis day as a common field. Originally the Town Neck with other common\r\nlands belonged to the whole town. In the MS. town records of Sandwich\r\nI find under date May 22, 1658, this vote: ‘If any inhabytant wanteth\r\nland to plant, hee may have some in the Towne Neck, or in the Common\r\nfor six yeare and noe longer.’ Later, in 1678, April 6, townsmen are\r\ngiven liberty to improve Neck lands ‘noe longer than ten yeares ...\r\nand then to be at the townsmen’s ordering again.’ In the year 1695,\r\nthe use of the Town Neck was restricted to the heirs of the original\r\nproprietors, and the land was staked out into 38 lots. The lots\r\nwere not fenced off, and the whole tract continued to lie under the\r\nauthority of the entire body of proprietors, like the arable fields of\r\na German village community. In 1696, April 4, it was agreed that the\r\nTown Neck should be improved for the future by planting and sowing as\r\na common field, until the major part of those interested should see\r\ncause otherwise to dispose or improve the same. The common fence was\r\nto be made up, and a gate to be provided by the first of May. A field\r\ndriver or hayward was to keep the Town Neck clear of creatures and to\r\nimpound for trespass. In 1700 it was voted that the Neck be cleared\r\nof creatures by the 16th of April, and that no part of the land be\r\nimproved by tillage other than by sowing.\r\n\r\n“And thus from the latter half of the 17th century down to the present\r\nday (May 9, 1881) have the proprietors of Sandwich Town Neck regulated\r\nthe use of their old common field. Every year they have met together\r\nin the Spring to determine when the fences should be set up and how\r\nthe pasture should be stinted. The old Commoners’ records are for the\r\nmost part still in existence as far back as the year 1693, and before\r\nthis time the town records are full of agrarian legislation, for the\r\nTown Neck was then virtually town property. There arose in Sandwich\r\nand in every New England village community the same strife between\r\nold residents and new comers, as between the Patricians and Plebeians\r\nof ancient Rome. The old settlers claimed a monopoly of public land,\r\nand the new comers demanded a share. In most old New England towns\r\nthe heirs of original settlers or of citizens living in the community\r\nat a specified date retained a monopoly of the common lands for many\r\nyears until finally compelled by force of public opinion to cede their\r\nclaims to the town. In Sandwich, however, a vestige of the old system\r\nhas survived to this day. Every Spring, for many years, has appeared a\r\npublic notice (I saw one in the _Seaside Press_, May 8, 1880) calling\r\ntogether the proprietors of the Town Neck at some store in the village\r\nto choose a moderator and a clerk, and to regulate the letting of cow\r\nrights for the ensuing year....\r\n\r\n“There were for many years in the town of Salem certain common fields\r\nowned by associated proprietors just as in the case of Sandwich Town\r\nNeck. Such were the north and south fields in Salem. The old Commoners’\r\nrecords of the south fields are still preserved in the library of\r\nthe Essex Institute, and date as far back as 1680. Under the date\r\nof October 14th of that year, I find the following: ‘Voted that the\r\nproprietors have liberty to put in cattle for herbage--that is to say\r\n6 cows, 4 oxen, 3 horses or yearlings, or 24 calves to 10 acres of\r\nland, and so in proportion to greater or less quantities of land; and\r\nno person shall cut or strip their Indian corn stalks after they have\r\ngathered their corn, on penalty of forfeiting herbage.’\r\n\r\n“The so-called great pastures of Salem, some 300 acres, are to this day\r\nowned and managed by a small company of proprietors in common, of whom\r\nDr. Wheatland of the Essex Institute has been for some years the clerk.\r\nHe has in his hands the records of the proprietory, extending back for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\n“These records are full of old time regulations in regard to common\r\nfencing, common pasturage, cow commons, sheep commons and the like.”\r\n(“The Germanic Origin of New England Towns” p. 33.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps still more conclusive are the following decrees of the\r\nlegislative body of Massachusetts, which Mr. Adams quotes. In the\r\nspring of 1643 the Massachusetts General Court ordered “For preventing\r\ndisorder in corn feilds wᶜʰ are inclosed in common ... that those who\r\nhave the greater quantity in such fields shall have power to order the\r\nwhole, notwithstanding any former order to the contrary, & that every\r\none who hath any part in such common feild shall make and maintaine the\r\nfences according to their severall quantities.”\r\n\r\nBut in the autumn of the same year, the Act was passed:--“Whereas it is\r\nfound by experience that there hath bene much trouble and difference\r\nin severall townes about the Manner of planting, sowing, & feeding\r\nof common corne ffeilds & that upon serious consideration wee find\r\nno general order can provide for the best improvement of every such\r\ncommon feild, by reason that some consists onely of plowing ground,\r\nsome haveing a great part fit onely for planting, some of meadowe and\r\nfeeding ground; also so that such an order as may be very wholesome &\r\ngood for one feild may bee exceeding preiudiciall & inconvenient for\r\nanother, it is therefore ordered, that where the commoners cannot agree\r\nabout the manner of improvement of their feild, either concerning the\r\nkind of graine that shalbee sowen or set therein, or concerning the\r\ntime and manner of feeding the herbage thereof, that then such persons\r\nin the severall townes that are deputed to order the prudenciall\r\naffaires thereof, shall order the same, or in case where no such are,\r\nthen the maior portion of the freemen, who are hereby enioyned wᵗʰ what\r\nconvenient speed they may to determine any such difference as may arise\r\nupon any information given them by the said commoners; & so much of any\r\nformer order as concerns the improvement of common feilds & that is\r\nhearby provided for, is hearby repealed.” (“Village Communities of Cape\r\nAnn and Salem.”)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF ENCLOSURE WITHOUT PARLIAMENTARY SANCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. FROM 1845 ONWARDS.\r\n\r\nAny statistical account of enclosure without Parliamentary sanction\r\nmust necessarily be vague in comparison with the statements which it is\r\npossible to make of enclosure by Act of Parliament, and must consist of\r\ninferences from evidence of varying value. And, naturally, the evidence\r\nin general becomes scantier in proportion as the period investigated is\r\nmore remote.\r\n\r\nThe Tithe Commutation maps and awards afford the richest mine of\r\ninformation for the period since 1836. We have seen that according to\r\nthe analysis of them published by the Copyhold, Enclosure and Tithe\r\nCommission in 1873, they indicated the existence at that date of\r\n264,307 acres of common fields. We have already seen how untrustworthy\r\nthis estimate is if taken for a basis for calculating the area of\r\nexisting common fields, how inaccurate it was even at the date at which\r\nit was published. But one great source of inaccuracy in it, as we\r\nhave seen, is the assumption that no enclosure, other than by Act of\r\nParliament, took place after the date of Tithe Commutation. If we could\r\neliminate all other errors, and also get a perfectly accurate statement\r\nof the area of existing common fields, we should then know how much\r\nenclosure of common fields has taken place without Parliamentary\r\nintervention since the date of Tithe Commutation. This date, of course,\r\nis different in different parishes, but the average date is about 1845.\r\n\r\nTo eliminate all other errors it would be necessary to go over all the\r\nwork again, a task which would take a single investigator several\r\nyears of continual labour, and would not then be accomplished unless\r\nthe investigator were himself infallible. We must therefore be content\r\nwith an approximate correction.[92]\r\n\r\n [92] There are no less than 11,783 separate sets of awards and\r\n apportionments, each with its map. The maps vary in size from about\r\n six or seven to over a hundred square feet each. The apportionments\r\n are bulky rolls of parchment.\r\n\r\nThe tithe maps and awards deposited with the Tithe Commission cover\r\nabout three-quarters of the area of England and Wales. The amount of\r\ncommon field in the other quarter is estimated on the assumption that\r\nin each county the part for which there are no tithe awards in the\r\ncustody of the Tithe Commission contained the same proportion of common\r\nfield as the part for which title awards existed. The common fields\r\nthus estimated amount to about two-fifths of the total estimate. If the\r\nparticulars given in the return for the different counties were added\r\nup, we should get the statement:--\r\n\r\n                                         Common Field Lands.\r\n                                               Acres.\r\n\r\n  Areas ascertained from the tithe documents  163,823\r\n  Estimated additional areas                  100,484\r\n                                              ───────\r\n                                              264,307\r\n                                              ═══════\r\n\r\nWe have seen that assuming the total of 163,823 acres is correctly\r\n“ascertained,” the estimate of 100,484 acres for the other parishes is\r\nvery excessive, because the most frequent reason for no title documents\r\nexisting in the custody of the Tithe Commission is that the commutation\r\nof tithes was effected before 1836 by a local Enclosure Act, which\r\nswept away the common fields.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, counties which were mainly enclosed by Acts of\r\nParliament are very partially covered by the tithe documents; counties\r\nwhich have few or no Acts for enclosure of common fields are nearly\r\nentirely so covered. For example, we have--\r\n\r\n┌────────────────────────┬───────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┐\r\n│                        │ Percentage of │ Area Covered │             │\r\n│          --            │ Area enclosed │   by Tithe   │ Area not so │\r\n│                        │    by Acts.   │  Documents.  │  Covered.   │\r\n├────────────────────────┴───────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┤\r\n│                                                                     │\r\n│               COUNTIES OF PARLIAMENTARY ENCLOSURE.                  │\r\n│                                                                     │\r\n│ Northampton            │     51·5      │    148,066   │   485,220   │\r\n│ Rutland                │     46·5      │     37,728   │    54,968   │\r\n│ Huntingdon             │     46·5      │     83,856   │   146,630   │\r\n│ Bedford                │     46·0      │    104,357   │   191,159   │\r\n│ Oxford                 │     45·6      │    214,889   │   252,417   │\r\n│ East Riding, Yorkshire │     40·1      │    263,473   │   479,228   │\r\n│ Leicester              │     38·2      │    158,889   │   352,539   │\r\n│                                                                     │\r\n│       COUNTIES WITH LITTLE OR NO PARLIAMENTARY ENCLOSURE.           │\r\n│                                                                     │\r\n│ Devon                  │    _Nil._     │  1,611,710   │    46,039   │\r\n│ Cornwall               │    _Nil._     │    851,486   │     6,122   │\r\n│ Kent                   │    _Nil._     │    973,726   │    29,246   │\r\n│ Shropshire             │      0·3      │    788,108   │    64,385   │\r\n│ Monmouth               │      0·4      │    329,430   │    16,292   │\r\n│ Cheshire               │      0·5      │    599,904   │   115,931   │\r\n└────────────────────────┴───────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┘\r\n\r\nFortunately there is another possible way of calculating the probable\r\narea of common field land which would have been found in the parishes\r\nnot covered by tithe documents, if it had been investigated at about\r\nthe same date.\r\n\r\nOut of the seventy-five parishes enclosed by Act of Parliament\r\nsince 1850--_i.e._, at a later date than almost all of the tithe\r\ndocuments--the Tithe Commission had the maps and awards of\r\nseventy-one--all, that is, but four. Common fields subsequently\r\nenclosed were to be found in these two classes of parishes in the\r\nproportion of 71 to 4; it is a fair inference that the total area of\r\ncommon fields, whether subsequently enclosed or not, was distributed in\r\nthe same proportion.\r\n\r\nOn this assumption we should have the following calculation:--\r\n\r\n                                        Common Field Lands.\r\n                                               Acres.\r\n\r\n  Areas ascertained from the tithe documents  163,823\r\n  Estimated additional areas                    9,229\r\n                                              ───────\r\n                       Total                  173,052\r\n                                              ═══════\r\n\r\nNo probable error in the additional estimate in this calculation would\r\nhave an appreciable effect on the total.\r\n\r\nNext, as we have noticed above, the “areas ascertained” require\r\ncorrection. This it is much more difficult to supply satisfactorily;\r\nall that we can do is to determine--(1) whether the number given is\r\nlikely to err by excess or by defect; (2) whether the error is likely\r\nto be large.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of the return was to establish the total amount of\r\nwaste land subject to common rights, and the proportion of such land\r\nlikely to be capable of cultivation. This part of the work was done\r\nwith great care, and particularly with great care not to include any\r\nland which was not certainly subject to common rights. The final figure\r\narrived at was certainly considerably in defect through the documents\r\non which it was based failing to mention common rights in all cases\r\nwhere they existed.\r\n\r\nThe part of the return relating to common field lands, on the other\r\nhand, was considered of less importance; the explanatory letter says\r\nwith regard to them:--\r\n\r\n“The common field lands are generally distinguishable by the particular\r\nmanner in which they are marked on the tithe maps, and their extent\r\nhas been estimated by these maps.” This means that areas on the tithe\r\nmaps subdivided by dotted lines were assumed to be common field lands.\r\nThis method had the advantage of comprehensiveness--it is probable\r\nthat scarcely any common field land escaped notice, if there were a\r\ntithe map for the parish in which it existed. I have only detected one\r\nerror of omission. The common fields of Eakring were very considerably\r\nin excess of the 54 acres at which they were estimated. But on the\r\nother hand it has the disadvantage of including with common field\r\nlands numerous cases of properties or holdings which were inadequately\r\ndivided from one another by fences or hedges, but which were not common\r\nfields. But it is very hard to say precisely what percentage ought to\r\nbe deducted to allow for this error. Generalising from all the cases\r\nin which I have been able to put estimates for particular parishes to\r\na test, I should say that more than one-sixth, but less than one-third\r\nof the total should be deducted. Taking the larger fraction, so as to\r\nleave the remainder under-estimated, rather than over-estimated, we\r\nhave--\r\n\r\n                                                  Acres.\r\n\r\n  Area of common field lands, by estimate above  173,052\r\n                  Less one-third                  57,684\r\n                                                 ───────\r\n                                                 115,368\r\n\r\n  Parliamentary enclosure since 1873 has\r\n    reduced the area of common fields by          14,842\r\n                                                 ───────\r\n                                                 100,526\r\n                                                 ═══════\r\n\r\nThe final remainder represents our corrected estimate of the area of\r\ncommon fields arable and commonable meadows of intermixed ownership\r\nwhich would now exist if there had been no enclosure except by Act of\r\nParliament since about the year 1845. The total area of such fields\r\nand meadows actually existing almost certainly does not exceed 30,000\r\nacres. We therefore may conclude that not less than 70,000 acres\r\nhave been enclosed as the result of the consolidation of farms and\r\nproperties and voluntary agreements and exchanges, since about the year\r\n1845, and that not more than 100,000 acres have been thus enclosed.\r\n\r\nThe total area of common fields enclosed by Acts since 1845, together\r\nwith such meadows and commons as were enclosed together with common\r\narable fields, is 139,517 acres.\r\n\r\nIt would therefore appear that such voluntary methods of enclosure have\r\naccounted in this period for an area something between half as large an\r\narea as Enclosure Acts and five-sevenths of that area.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of villages in which common fields have been entirely\r\ngot rid of by voluntary enclosure during the same period would of\r\ncourse be smaller; because wherever common fields exist they are\r\nsubject to continual diminution by gradual enclosure; and the final\r\napplication of an Act of Parliament may be merely the _coup de grace_.\r\nCuriously, also, it may happen that a practically complete enclosure\r\nmay be effected, and years later resort be had to an Act, as in the\r\ncases of Hildersham (Cambridge), and Sutton (Northampton).\r\n\r\n\r\nB. BEFORE 1845.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural survey of Great Britain carried out by the Board\r\nof Agriculture in 1793 furnishes us with much information about the\r\nstate of enclosure of some counties, and with scraps of information\r\nabout others. Where the information is fullest it may take the form\r\nof estimates of the total area enclosed or open, or the form of\r\ninformation with regard to particular villages. By correlating the\r\ninformation thus supplied with that furnished by the Acts themselves,\r\nand from other sources, we can in some cases obtain a fairly full\r\naccount of the enclosure history of a county.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEDFORDSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe “General Report on the Agriculture of Bedfordshire” gives the\r\nfollowing estimate of the condition of the county (p. 11):--\r\n\r\n                                                         Acres.\r\n  Enclosed meadow, pasture and arable                    68,100\r\n  Woodland                                               21,900\r\n  Common fields, common meadows, commons and waste      217,200\r\n                                                        ───────\r\n                                             Total      307,200\r\n                                                        ═══════\r\n\r\nThe area of Bedfordshire being 298,500 acres, a slight deduction should\r\nbe made from the figures under each head. But this does not affect the\r\ntwo striking points about the estimate: (1) that over two-thirds of the\r\narea of the county was open, and (2) that the open and commonable land\r\namounted to over 200,000 acres.\r\n\r\nThe author proceeds: “Every parish which is commonly understood to be\r\nopen consists of a certain proportion of antient inclosed land near\r\nthe respective villages, but that proportion, compared with the open\r\ncommon field in each respective parish, does not on an average exceed\r\none-tenth of the whole” (p. 25).\r\n\r\nHe further says that Lidlington, Sundon and Potton had been recently\r\nenclosed. Each was enclosed by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe can deal with the above information in two ways: (1) by translating\r\nit into terms of parishes, and (2) by dealing with it in terms of acres.\r\n\r\nIn Bedfordshire very little common indeed existed apart from the open\r\nfield parishes. This is proved by the fact that from 1700 to 1870\r\nthere were only three enclosures of commons, apart from arable common\r\nfields, comprising an area of 867 acres, and that the tithe maps only\r\nindicated 507 acres more of commons in parishes where there were no\r\ncommon fields. We may safely assume that at least 200,000 acres out\r\nof our author’s 217,200 acres of open land belonged to open field\r\nvillages, and that these villages also had, in accordance with his\r\nestimate, 20,000 acres of old enclosures, the area of all the open\r\nfields parishes in 1764 was, according to the estimate, about 220,000\r\nacres; that of the enclosed parishes about 87,200 acres. If the numbers\r\nof the parishes enclosed and open were about in the same proportion,\r\nout of the one hundred and twenty-one parishes in Bedfordshire, there\r\nshould have been eighty-seven open and thirty-four enclosed.\r\n\r\nFrom the list of Parliamentary enclosures in the appendix, it will be\r\nseen that seventy-three parishes were enclosed by Acts passed in 1798\r\nand later. There were also seven other parishes in which the tithe\r\ndocuments indicate common fields surviving up to the date of Tithe\r\nCommission, making a total of eighty parishes, which we have previously\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\nIt would follow that about seven parishes were enclosed in Bedfordshire\r\nbetween 1794 and 1845 without any Act. This is in accordance with what\r\nwe might reasonably expect.\r\n\r\nOf the thirty-four parishes which by this argument were enclosed in\r\n1790, seventeen had been enclosed by Acts passed between the years 1742\r\nand 1783, leaving a remainder of seventeen parishes. There is obviously\r\na strong probability that the majority of these were enclosed in the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nBut in this calculation I have treated the 21,900 acres of woodland\r\nas though it were part of the enclosed parishes. If it be considered\r\nto belong indifferently to open and enclosed parishes, the above\r\ncalculation must be modified. We then have ninety-four parishes open\r\nin 1793, and twenty-seven enclosed; fourteen out of the ninety-four\r\nwould be enclosed without Parliamentary sanction between 1793 and 1845,\r\nleaving only ten parishes so enclosed at some unknown date earlier than\r\n1793.\r\n\r\nBy dealing with the Bedfordshire estimate on the basis of acreage\r\ninstead of parishes, I arrive at the following statement of the history\r\nof the enclosure of Bedford:--\r\n\r\n                                                 Acres.\r\n  Ancient woodland and waste, which passed\r\n    directly into individual use, and ancient\r\n    roads, &c.                                   43,000\r\n  Common fields, meadows and pastures enclosed\r\n    before 1742                                  33,000\r\n  Ditto enclosed from 1742–1793 by Acts of\r\n                                Parliament       23,883\r\n  Ditto    ″       ″    ″    ″ not by Acts       26,000\r\n  Ditto    ″       ″  1793–1900 by Acts         114,430\r\n  Ditto    ″       ″    ″    ″ not by Acts       58,000\r\n                                                ───────\r\n  Total                                         298,313\r\n                                                ═══════\r\n\r\nArthur Young, in June, 1768, travelled through Bedfordshire to St.\r\nNeots, and then close to the boundary between Bedford and Huntingdon\r\nto Kimbolton and Thrapston in Northamptonshire. He found from Sandy\r\nto St. Neots the country chiefly open, and that it continued so to\r\nKimbolton and Thrapston; though with regard to the two latter places\r\nhe mentions enclosed pastures (“Northern Tour,” 2nd Ed., Vol. I., pp.\r\n55–59). This, so far as it goes, tends to confirm our conclusions.\r\n\r\nI am anxious not to lay any undue stress on the above arithmetical\r\ncalculations; but I think it is quite clear that up to the year 1742\r\nthe condition of the county of Bedford was that indicated by Leland’s\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nLeland passed through Bedfordshire in his “Itinerary.” From Vol. I.,\r\nfols. 116–120, we find that from Higham Ferrers in Northamptonshire,\r\nabout 2 miles from the Bedfordshire boundary, to Bedford (14 miles)\r\nwas “champaine” from Wellington village, near Bedford, to Antchille\r\nCastle (Ampthill), “12 miles almost al by Champayn Grounde, part by\r\ncorne and part by Pasture, and sum baren hethy and sandy grounde.”\r\nThen “From Antchille to Dunstable X m. or more. First I passed partely\r\nby woddy ground and Enclosures. But after most parte by champaine\r\nGrounde.... And thens to Mergate al by Champaine a vj miles.” And so\r\nout of Bedfordshire. A small part of the county was ancient woodland,\r\na smaller part was cultivated land reclaimed from the forest state,\r\nwhich had never passed through the common fields system of cultivation,\r\nbut almost all was in the condition of the typical open field parish,\r\ncommon field arable, commonable meadows, and common pastures, with a\r\ncertain amount of enclosure round the villages. It would appear that\r\nduring the 200 years following Leland’s journey only an insignificant\r\namount of progress in enclosure took place in Bedfordshire. This\r\nconclusion is not contradicted, but on the other hand it is not\r\nstrikingly confirmed by Walter Blyth (“The English Improver,”\r\n1649), who enumerates as unenclosed “the south part of Warwick and\r\nWorcestershire, Leicester, Notts, Rutland, some part of Lincoln,\r\nNorthampton, Buckingham, some part of Bedfordshire, most part of the\r\nVales of England, and very many parcels in most counties.”\r\n\r\nOne further point may be noticed. In Bedfordshire the percentage\r\nof the total area enclosed by Act of Parliament is exceptionally\r\nhigh--46·0 per cent. We find that when we make allowances for (1)\r\ncontemporary voluntary enclosure, (2) for ancient woodland and for\r\nsome land passing directly from the forest state into that of separate\r\nownership and occupation, (3) for some ancient enclosing of land in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of villages, there is little or no other enclosure\r\nremaining to be referred to the period before Parliamentary enclosure\r\nbegan--in this case the year 1742.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHAMPTON, RUTLAND, S.E. WARWICK AND LEICESTER.\r\n\r\nThese four counties may be said to form a definite group, so far\r\nas their enclosure history is concerned. The main facts of their\r\nParliamentary enclosure are shown in the following table:--\r\n\r\n┌─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n│             │           Acreage Enclosed        │               │\r\n│    ----     ├─────────────────┬─────────────────┤ Percentage of │\r\n│             │ By 18th Century │ By 19th Century │  Total Area.  │\r\n│             │      Acts.      │     Acts.       │               │\r\n├─────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n│ Warwick     │     124,828     │     24,731      │     25·0      │\r\n│ Leicester   │     187,717     │     12,660      │     38·2      │\r\n│ Rutland     │     37,180      │     10,044      │     46·5      │\r\n│ Northampton │     247,517     │     85,251      │     51·8      │\r\n└─────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nLike Bedford, they are all counties with a high proportion of enclosure\r\nby Act of Parliament; but they differ from Bedford in that their\r\nenclosure was much more preponderatingly effected in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The proportion of eighteenth-century Acts is particularly\r\nhigh in Leicester, but the proportion of Acts earlier than 1760 is\r\nhigher in Warwick than in any other county--twenty-nine out of 114.\r\nThese counties comprise the district in which the greatest amount of\r\nagitation arose against enclosure in the seventeenth century, and that\r\nin which the effect of enclosure in causing depopulation through decay\r\nof tillage was most marked in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EAST MIDLANDS\r\n\r\nSECTION 1.\r\n\r\n  Map of Rutland, Northamptonshire, Huntingtonshire, Cambridgeshire,\r\n      Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and part of Essex\r\n      showing land enclosed:\r\n        before the General Enclosure Act of 1801.\r\n        between 1802 and 1845.\r\n        under General Enclosure Act of 1845.\r\n    Scale 1:1,000,000 or 1 inch = 15.78 Stat. miles.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHAMPTONSHIRE.\r\n\r\nNorthamptonshire has 51·5 per cent. of its area covered by Acts of\r\nParliament for the enclosure of whole parishes, a larger proportion\r\nthan any other county. There have been passed in addition an important\r\nAct for extinguishing foreign rights in Rockingham Forest in 1796, an\r\nAct in 1812 for draining and enclosing Borough Fen, and creating a new\r\nparish to be called Newborough, and three other Acts for enclosing\r\ncommons or wastes; the whole area affected by the five Acts being\r\nperhaps 15,000 acres. These being included, the total area which has\r\nundergone Parliamentary enclosure reaches 54 per cent. of the area of\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nJames Donaldson, the Board of Agriculture reporter, says that of the\r\n316 parishes, 227 were enclosed by 1793, and eighty-nine were then in\r\nopen field; and that “half of the inclosed parishes may be denominated\r\nold inclosure.”\r\n\r\nOf the eighty-nine parishes, open in 1793, eighty-eight have been\r\nenclosed by Act of Parliament since; so that there was only one parish\r\nenclosed without Parliamentary intervention from 1793 to 1903, when\r\nthe last trace of the Northamptonshire common fields was swept away\r\nby the enclosure of Sutton. This fact is remarkable, it points to a\r\nwide diffusion of ownership of lands and of rights over the land; and\r\nit should be associated with the specially strenuous resistance of\r\nNorthamptonshire to enclosure in the reign of James I.\r\n\r\nThe statement that of the enclosed parishes half may be denominated\r\nold enclosure, would be more enlightening if one knew exactly what Mr.\r\nDonaldson meant by old enclosure. But we find that 113 parishes (which\r\nis as near as possible half 227) were enclosed by Acts passed in the\r\nperiod 1765–1792; if therefore by “old enclosure” he means enclosure\r\ndating back more than twenty-eight years, his statement would imply\r\nthat there was no enclosure without an Act in that period. Nineteen\r\nparishes were enclosed by Act in the five years 1760–1764, eighteen\r\nin the period 1749–1759, and four earlier. These Acts altogether\r\naccount for the enclosure of 153 out of the 227 parishes, and there is\r\nevidently a strong balance of probability that the enclosure of the\r\nremaining seventy-two took place almost entirely before the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEICESTERSHIRE.\r\n\r\nR. Monk, the reporter for Leicester, gives as an Appendix a list of the\r\n“Lordships” of that county, with the names of the Lords of the manors,\r\nor chief landowners, and the date of enclosure, when he could ascertain\r\nit. He only knew of ten open field parishes and of two half open and\r\nhalf enclosed; but, of these, four, Cold Overton, Cole Orton, Whitwick\r\nand Worthington, have not since been enclosed by Act of Parliament;\r\nthey must therefore have been enclosed voluntarily at the end of the\r\neighteenth or in the first half of the nineteenth century; for the\r\ntithe documents for these parishes do not indicate any surviving\r\ncommon field. For thirty-five of the parishes not enclosed by Act of\r\nParliament, Monk gives no information; of the following fifteen he\r\ngives the date of enclosure:--\r\n\r\n┌──────────────────────┬───────────┐\r\n│        Parish.       │ Enclosed. │\r\n├──────────────────────┼───────────┤\r\n│ Shanktons            │    1738   │\r\n│ Birstall             │    1759   │\r\n│ Beeby                │    1761   │\r\n│ Thurnaston           │    1762   │\r\n│ Saxelby              │    1765   │\r\n│ Frisby               │    1769   │\r\n│ Stretton Parva       │    1770   │\r\n│ Stapleford           │    1772   │\r\n│ Shearsby             │    1773   │\r\n│ Hathorn              │    1777   │\r\n│ Ilston               │    1788   │\r\n│ South Kilworth       │    1789   │\r\n│ Hose                 │    1791   │\r\n│ Barkston and Plunger │    1791   │\r\n└──────────────────────┴───────────┘\r\n\r\nThe following fifty-five he merely describes as “enclosed”:--\r\n\r\n          Allexton\r\n          Aston Flamville\r\n          Barwell\r\n          Bittesby\r\n          Blackfordby\r\n          Brooksby\r\n          Broughton Astley\r\n          Burrow\r\n          Burton-by-Prestwould\r\n          Cadeby\r\n          Carlton\r\n          Coston\r\n          Cotes\r\n          Dadlington\r\n          Dalby-in-the-Wolds\r\n          Great Dalby\r\n          Dishly Grange\r\n          Eastwell\r\n          Edmundthorpe\r\n          Fenny Drayton\r\n          Foolesworth\r\n          Gaddesby\r\n          Garthorpe\r\n          Galby\r\n          Goadby\r\n          Hether\r\n          Huncote\r\n          Ibstock\r\n          Isley Walton\r\n          Knossington\r\n          Lockington\r\n          Loseby\r\n          Market Bosworth\r\n          Potters Marston\r\n          Misterton\r\n          Normanton-on-the-Heath\r\n          Odstone\r\n          Rollestone\r\n          Saxby\r\n          Snareston\r\n          Stapleton\r\n          Stretton Magna\r\n          Swepston\r\n          Thorpe Arnold\r\n          Thurnby\r\n          Tilton-on-the-Hill\r\n          Twycross\r\n          Ullesthorpe\r\n          Welham\r\n          Little Wigston\r\n          Witherby\r\n          Woodthorpe\r\n          Owston\r\n          Staunton Harold\r\n  Wanlip he describes as enclosed lately.\r\n\r\nThe following forty he describes as “old enclosure,” or gives\r\nseventeenth-century dates for their enclosure--\r\n\r\n          Ashby Folville\r\n          Great Ashby\r\n          Barlston\r\n          Buckminster\r\n          Beaumont Leys\r\n          Burbage\r\n          Burton Lazars\r\n          Braunston-by-Kirkby\r\n          Carleton Curlew\r\n          Catthorp\r\n          Cossington\r\n          Cotterback\r\n          Little Dalby\r\n          Elmesthorpe\r\n          Enderby\r\n          Foston\r\n          Freathby\r\n          Glen Parva\r\n          Kirkby Beler\r\n          Lodington\r\n          Muston\r\n          Nailston\r\n          Newton Linford\r\n          Packington\r\n          Peatling Magna\r\n          Prestwould\r\n          Ragdale\r\n          Scraptoft\r\n          Shawell\r\n          Staunton Wyville\r\n          Stoke Golding\r\n          Thedingworth\r\n          Thorpe Sacheville\r\n          Welby\r\n          Willoughby Waterless\r\n          Wyfordby (or Wiverby)\r\n          Wymondham\r\n\r\nPickwell, he says, was enclosed in 1628, Shenton in 1646, and Laughton\r\nin 1665.\r\n\r\nHere, again, in interpreting these statements, we are confronted\r\nwith the difficulty of determining what antiquity is implied by the\r\nterm “old enclosure,” and also by the difficulty of estimating what\r\nproportion of the parishes described merely as “enclosed” belonged to\r\nany particular epoch of enclosure.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, we note (1) that one-third of the open field\r\nparishes known to Monk were enclosed without Acts in the following\r\nhalf-century, (2) that he gives the date of enclosure of fifteen other\r\nparishes for which we have no Acts, which were enclosed in the previous\r\nhalf-century. It would therefore appear that a very considerable amount\r\nof enclosure was going on, without Acts of Parliament, during the\r\nperiod in which Parliamentary enclosure was proceeding rapidly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the fact that he can give seventeenth-century dates\r\nfor the enclosure of three parishes suggests that probably a very large\r\nproportion of his “old enclosure parishes” and a fair proportion of his\r\nenclosed parishes were enclosed in the seventeenth century.[93]\r\n\r\n [93] William Pitt, who made a second survey of the agriculture\r\n of Leicestershire for the Board, published in 1809, gives an\r\n interesting account of the enclosure of the vale of Belvoir. This, the\r\n north-eastern corner of Leicestershire, was enclosed between 1760 and\r\n 1800; and as a result a complete change in the cultivation took place;\r\n the rich land in the valleys, which had been arable common fields, was\r\n laid down in grass, and the tenants forbidden under heavy penalties\r\n to plough it; while the summits of the hills and edges of the vales,\r\n which had been sheep-runs, were converted into arable land.\r\n\r\nPursuing the inquiry backwards, we find our next source of information\r\nin Celia Fiennes, a lady of Newtontony, who made a series of rides in\r\nthe last few years of the seventeenth century. Newtontony is three\r\nmiles east of Amesbury, amid the open chalk hills, or, as she describes\r\nit, in the midst of “a fine open champion country”, and she usually\r\ndescribes the aspect of the country she passes through. She travelled\r\nwestwards to Land’s End, eastwards to Kent, northwards to the Border,\r\nand she gives some information with regard to the state of enclosure\r\nof most of the English counties. She went through both Bedfordshire\r\nand Northamptonshire, but with regard to those two counties gives no\r\ninformation as to their condition of enclosure. As she is more apt to\r\nnotice the presence than the absence of hedges, this, so far as it\r\ngoes, confirms our conclusions with regard to Bedfordshire; and, with\r\nregard to Northamptonshire, this small piece of negative evidence tends\r\nto the conclusion that that county also was almost entirely open in the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n“Leicestershire,” she says, “is a very Rich Country--Red land, good\r\ncorn of all sorts and grass, _both fields and inclosures_. You see a\r\ngreat way upon their hills the bottoms full of Enclosures, woods, and\r\ndifferent sorts of manureing and herbage” (p. 133).\r\n\r\nIt is evident that enclosure had considerably advanced; but it must\r\nbe noted that “fields” with Celia Fiennes means common fields. It is\r\nfurther to be noted that her description of the enclosures creeping up\r\nthe hills implies a process of gradual enclosure. Of the neighbourhood\r\nof Bosworth (in the west of Leicestershire) she says, “this is a great\r\nflatt full of good Enclosures.” The western side of Leicestershire was\r\ntherefore mainly enclosed before 1700, while the north-east was all\r\nopen till 1760.\r\n\r\nBut though enclosure was so far advanced in Leicestershire, “their\r\nfewell,” Celia Fiennes says, “is but cowdung or Coale.” The use of\r\ncowdung for fuel supplied to advocates of enclosure in the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries one of their chief arguments. Either the\r\nhedges of Leicestershire were not yet able to supply enough wood for\r\nfuel, or the old custom continued although it was as unnecessary as\r\nobjectionable. In either case the natural inference is that much of\r\nthe enclosure of Leicestershire which Celia Fiennes observed, was then\r\nrecent.[94]\r\n\r\n [94] Arthur Young found the practice still prevalent in\r\n Northamptonshire more than seventy years later: “they collect all the\r\n cow-dung from their fields and daub it in lumps, barns, and stables,\r\n to dry for fuel” (“Eastern Tour,” Vol. I., p. 48). Edward Lawrence\r\n speaks of Yorkshire (evidently the East Riding only is meant) and\r\n Lincolnshire as the counties where the practice prevailed in 1727\r\n (“The Duty of a Steward to his Lord,” Article 3).\r\n\r\nThis again is confirmed by Walter Blyth, who in the passage quoted\r\nabove describes Leicestershire as entirely open, as well as\r\nNorthampton, Rutland, and the south part of Warwick.\r\n\r\nFurther detailed information is given by the disputants Joseph Lee,\r\nJohn Moore, and the anonymous writers who joined in the controversy,\r\nwho debated the ethics of enclosure in the Midlands in the years\r\n1653–1657. John Moore, in his first pamphlet, asks, “Above one hundred\r\ntouns inclosed in Leicestershire, how few amongst them all are not\r\nunpeopled and uncorned?” Now it is probably fair to read “above one\r\nhundred” as “about one hundred” or “nearly one hundred.” The names\r\nof some of these are supplied by Joseph Lee in his “Vindication\r\nof Regulated Enclosure,” for he gives (page 5) as examples of\r\nenclosure without depopulation the following thirteen parishes in\r\nLeicestershire: Market Bosworth, Carlton, Coten, Shenton, Cadesby\r\n(Cadeby), Bilson (Billesdon), Twicriss, Higham, Golding (Stoke\r\nGolding), Little Glen, Croft, Ashby Magna, and Stapleton, together with\r\nStoke in Northamptonshire, Upton and Barton, which might be either\r\nin Northampton or in Warwick, and three others, Nelson, Cosford and\r\nWoscot, which I am unable to locate, except that Cosford was near\r\nCatthorp, the extreme south corner of Leicestershire; for Lee further\r\ngives a list of fifteen enclosures within three miles of Catthorp, in\r\nwhich Cosford and Coten are included, and also Bigging, Brownsover,\r\nShawell, Streetfield, Over, Cottesbatch, Pultney, Sturmer, Hallfield,\r\nSister (? Siston), Moorebarn, Cotes and Misterton (p. 8).\r\n\r\nOf the former set of townships he says: “They have been enclosed some\r\ntwenty, some thirty, some forty or fifty years.” Of the latter he says:\r\n“Most of these Inclosures have been plowed within thirty years, and the\r\nrest are now about to be plowed.”\r\n\r\nIt would appear, therefore, that enclosure began in Leicestershire\r\nat about the beginning of the seventeenth century, and proceeded\r\nso rapidly that nearly a hundred townships, mainly situated in the\r\nsouth and west of the county, were enclosed within about fifty years.\r\nEnclosure also began in Northamptonshire about the same time, but at\r\nnot so great a rate. The author of “Considerations Concerning Common\r\nFields and Enclosures,” published in 1653, makes a reference to “Mr.\r\nBentham’s[95] Christian Conflict” (p. 322), which gives a list of\r\neleven manors in Northamptonshire, enclosed and depopulated. In a later\r\nsermon, “A Scripture Word against Inclosures,” 1656, John Moore says:\r\n“England (especially Leicestershire and the counties round about)\r\nstands now as guilty in the sight of God of the sinnes in the text.\r\nThey sold the righteous for silver and the poor for a pair of shoes, as\r\nIsrael did then” (p. 1). A little later he again referred to “Enclosure\r\nin Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, and the counties adjacent.”\r\nThis confirms the conclusion reached from the other evidence that\r\nLeicestershire was in the centre of the seventeenth-century movement of\r\nenclosure of common fields, and that it was in Leicestershire that the\r\nmovement was most effective.\r\n\r\n [95] This was Joseph Bentham of Kettering, who published “The Societie\r\n of the Saints,” in 1638, in which he denounces enclosure with\r\n remarkable vehemence.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUTLAND.\r\n\r\nRutlandshire has had 46·5 per cent. of its area enclosed by Acts of\r\nParliament, 47,224 acres. Of this area 14,641 acres were enclosed by\r\nActs passed between 1756 and 1773; then for twenty years there were no\r\nActs, the next being passed in 1793. By that and subsequent Acts 32,583\r\nacres were enclosed.\r\n\r\nJohn Crutchley, the Board of Agriculture reporter, says that two-thirds\r\nof the country was enclosed, one-third unenclosed (“Agriculture of\r\nRutland, 1793,” p. 30). As the area (32,583 acres) is just one-third\r\nof the total area of Rutlandshire (97,273 acres), Acts of Parliament\r\nentirely account for all the enclosure since 1793. Of the area enclosed\r\nbefore 1793 there remains about 50,000 acres, a little more than half\r\nthe county, unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nPart at least must have been enclosed before the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, for Celia Fiennes says: “Rutlandshire seems more\r\nwoody and enclosed than some others” (p. 54). It is one of the counties\r\ndescribed by Walter Blyth as entirely unenclosed in 1649; but, as we\r\nhave seen, this description is also applied by him to Leicestershire\r\nand Northamptonshire, and as it was, especially in the case of the\r\nformer county, decidedly too sweeping, we cannot infer that no\r\nenclosure took place in Rutlandshire before that date.\r\n\r\nLeland passed through Uppingham and Stanford; he found part of the\r\ncounty woody, but he makes no mention of enclosure.\r\n\r\nHe also gives a very full description of the counties of Leicester and\r\nNorthamptonshire. Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, and Rockingham\r\nForest in Northamptonshire, were then very extensive; but all the\r\nremainder of the two counties he describes in general as “champaine,”\r\nor by words which imply an unenclosed condition. The only mention\r\nof enclosure is in the case of two parks in Northamptonshire. (See\r\nAppendix C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWARWICK.\r\n\r\nWarwickshire is divided by the River Avon into two parts of\r\napproximately equal area; the north-western part is a district of\r\nancient enclosure, probably enclosed in the main direct from the\r\nforest state; the south-eastern part has a similar enclosure history\r\nto Leicester and Northampton, except that its enclosure took place\r\ngenerally somewhat earlier. One-quarter of the whole county has\r\nundergone Parliamentary enclosure, but the proportion so enclosed of\r\nthe south-eastern part is much larger.\r\n\r\nJohn Wedge, the Board of Agriculture reporter, estimates that in 1793,\r\nout of a total area of 618,000 acres, 57,000 was open field land (p.\r\n11). To reduce 618,000 to the true area of the county (577,462 acres),\r\none must deduct 10 per cent. A deduction of 10 per cent. leaves about\r\n51,000 acres of common field. Enclosure Acts since account for 38,444\r\nacres, and in parishes not enclosed by Acts the tithe documents\r\nindicate rather over 1000 acres of common field lands. There remains a\r\nlittle over 10,000 acres unaccounted for, which has disappeared between\r\n1793 and the date of tithe commutation.\r\n\r\nJohn Wedge appears to have attempted a list of open field parishes with\r\ntheir area and extent of common field and waste, but only got so far as\r\nto supply this information for five parishes (p. 54), each of which has\r\nundergone subsequent enclosure by Act of Parliament. He draws attention\r\nto the contrast between the two parts of Warwickshire: “About forty\r\nyears ago the southern and eastern parts of this county consisted\r\nmostly of open fields. There are still about 50,000 acres of open field\r\nland which in a few years will probably all be enclosed. These lands,\r\nbeing now grazed, want much fewer hands than they did in the former\r\nopen state. Upon all inclosures of open fields the farms have generally\r\nbeen made much larger. For these causes the hardy yeomanry of country\r\nvillages have been driven for employment into Birmingham, Coventry, and\r\nother manufacturing towns.”\r\n\r\nAbout 90,000 acres was enclosed by Act of Parliament in the part of\r\nWarwick described between 1743 and 1798. This, together with the 50,000\r\nacres remaining, amounts to rather less than half the area of the\r\ndivision of the county under consideration. As Wedge clearly was of\r\nopinion that the greater part of S.E. Warwick was open at the date he\r\nmentions, and as there is no reason for thinking he was wrong, it is to\r\nbe inferred that a considerable amount of non-Parliamentary enclosure\r\nwas going on in S.E. Warwick during the second half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe extracts above given with reference to Leicester and Northampton\r\nalso prove that enclosure was going on in this part of the county\r\nduring the first half of the sixteenth century, though it had so little\r\nadvanced up to 1649 that Blyth speaks of this part of the county as\r\nunenclosed.\r\n\r\nLeland gives an extremely full account of the state of enclosure of\r\nWarwickshire, which shows that as early as 1540 the north-west part of\r\nthe county was “much enclosed.” It was on one of his later journeys\r\nthat he explored the county, entering from Oxfordshire. He found,\r\n“Banbury to Warwick, twelve miles by Champaine Groundes, fruitful of\r\ncorne and grasse, and two miles by some enclosed and woody groundes”\r\n(Vol. IV., Part 2, fol. 162).\r\n\r\n“I learned at Warwick that the most part of the shire of Warwicke, that\r\nlyeth as Avon River descendeth on the right hand or ripe of it, is in\r\nArden (for soe is the ancient Name of that part of the shire); and the\r\nground in Arden is much enclosed, plentifull of grasse, but not of\r\ncorne. The other part of Warwickshire that lyeth on the left hand or\r\nripe of Avon River, much to the south, is for the most part Champion,\r\nsomewhat barren of wood, but plentifull of corne” (fol. 166 a).\r\n\r\nWe may add, so as to complete our review of the evidence, that William\r\nMarshall, in his book on the “Agriculture of the Midland District of\r\nEngland” (1790), treats a region of which the town of Leicester was\r\nnear the centre, comprising the counties of Warwick, Rutland, the\r\nnorth of Leicester and of Northampton, the east of Staffordshire, and\r\nthe southern extremities of Derby and Nottingham, as an agricultural\r\nunit. He says: “Thirty years ago much of this district was in an open\r\nstate, and some townships still remain open; there are others, however,\r\nwhich appear to have been long in a state of enclosure, and in which,\r\nno doubt, the present system of management originated” (p. 8). This\r\ndoes not add to our information about this district, but the fact that\r\nMarshall was perfectly correct in his reading of the story told by the\r\naspect of the country is important, because for some other districts\r\nhis testimony is material.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we find that in the north-west of Warwick enclosure was\r\ngeneral as early as 1540, while it was practically non-existent in the\r\nsouth-east of that county and in Leicester, Northampton and Rutland.\r\nWe find that the movement towards enclosure of the “champaine” country\r\nbegan about the year 1600, that it proceeded steadily in spite of\r\ngreat popular resistance through the seventeenth century, but at a\r\nmuch greater rate in Leicester, and probably in S.E. Warwick, than\r\nin Northamptonshire, the rate in Rutland being probably slower than\r\nin Leicester, but certainly greater than in Northamptonshire, the\r\ncourse of the movement being from west to east; that about half of\r\nS.E. Warwick and of Leicester was enclosed when the movement of\r\nParliamentary enclosure began, but less than half of Rutland, and not\r\nmore than quarter (probably not more than a fifth) of Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the enclosure of Bedford was later than this, and we\r\nshall see that the same is true of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdon. In\r\nthe midlands of England the course of enclosure from 1600 onwards was\r\nfrom west to east.\r\n\r\nA word may be added with regard to the methods by which\r\nnon-Parliamentary enclosure was effected in this district. There was\r\ngreat diversity in Leicestershire from village to village with regard\r\nto the diffusion of property, as may be seen from Monk’s Appendix, in\r\nwhich he endeavours to give the names of the principal owners in each\r\n“lordship.” Some were entirely in the hands of a single individual,\r\nothers had many owners, but in the great majority the land was mainly,\r\nbut not entirely, owned by the lord of the manor. The description of\r\nthe enclosure of S.E. Warwick supplied by John Wedge, the consolidation\r\nof farms, and the depopulation of the villages, indicates that there\r\nenclosure, whether by Act of Parliament or not, was carried through by\r\nthe authority of the lord of the manor, he being the main landowner.\r\n\r\nThe method by which this would be done when an Act of Parliament was\r\nnot resorted to is fully explained by Edward Lawrence (“The Duty of a\r\nSteward to his Lord, 1727”), Article XIV.\r\n\r\n“A Steward should not forget to make the best Enquiry into the\r\ndisposition of any of the Freeholders within or near any of his Lord’s\r\nManors, to sell their Lands, that he may use his best Endeavours\r\nto purchase them at as reasonable a price as may be for his Lord’s\r\nAdvantage and Convenience ... especially in such Manors where\r\nimprovements are to be made by inclosing Commons and Common Fields;\r\nwhich (as every one, who is acquainted with the late Improvements in\r\nAgriculture must know) is not a little advantageous to the Nation\r\nin general, as well as highly profitable to the Undertaker. If the\r\nFreeholders cannot _all_ be perswaded to sell, yet at least an\r\nAgreement for Inclosing should be pushed forward, by the Steward, and\r\na scheme laid, wherein it may appear that an exact and proportional\r\nshare will be allotted to every proprietor; perswading them first, if\r\npossible, to sign a Form of Agreement, and then to chuse Commissioners\r\non both sides.... If the Steward be a Man of good sense, he will find\r\na necessity of making use of it all, in rooting out _superstition_\r\nfrom amongst them, as what is so great a hindrance to all _noble_\r\nImprovements.” The superstition referred to, is that enclosed land is\r\ncursed, and doomed in three generations to pass out of the hands of the\r\ndescendants of the proprietor who enclosed it.\r\n\r\nThat in the early seventeenth century much of the enclosure was carried\r\nout by the power of the lord of the manor is plain from the scraps of\r\ninformation given by John Moore. Thus he tells us that Ashby Magna was\r\nenclosed in 1606, and that the lord gave most of his tenants leases\r\nfor three lives and twenty-one years after (“Scripture Word Against\r\nInclosures,” p. 9), that being the reason why depopulation had not\r\nresulted up to 1656; that in both Misterton and Poultney no house at\r\nall was left except the minister’s, so that these two manors must have\r\nbeen the property of absentee landlords.\r\n\r\nBut Catthorpe had no lord of the manor, it consisted of 580 acres\r\ndivided among eight freeholders and five or six holders of “ancient\r\ncottages” who were also Freeholders (Joseph Lee, p. 5). The enclosure\r\nwas carried out by the agreement of all the owners, except one who\r\nobjected on conscientious grounds. The way in which these agreements to\r\nenclose were effected in parishes where property was divided is thus\r\ndescribed by Moore:--“In common fields they live like loving neighbours\r\ntogether for the most part, till the _Spirit of Inclosure_ enter into\r\nsome rich Churles heart, who doe not only pry out but feign occasions\r\nto goe to law with their neighbours, and no reconcilement be made till\r\nthey consent to Inclosure. So this Inclosure makes thieves, and then\r\nthey cry out of thieves. Because they sold the righteous for silver,\r\nand the poor for a pair of shoes. If it had not been for two or three\r\nrighteous in many Townes of these Inland Counties, what desolation had\r\nthere been made ere this time?” (Scripture Word, p. 12).\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE AND HUNTINGDON.\r\n\r\nMuch of these two counties anciently consisted of fen and marsh, and\r\nof the land now cultivated a great deal never passed through the\r\ncommon field system. But the “upland” of each county was very late in\r\nundergoing enclosure.\r\n\r\nVancouver, the reporter for Cambridgeshire, gives an estimate of the\r\nareas of lands of different description, which I slightly rearrange\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n┌──────────────────────────┬─────────────┬───────────┬───────────┐\r\n│        ----              │ Unenclosed. │ Enclosed. │ Doubtful. │\r\n├──────────────────────────┼─────────────┼───────────┼───────────┤\r\n│                          │   Acres.    │  Acres.   │   Acres.  │\r\n│ Enclosed arable          │     --      │  15,000   │    --     │\r\n│ Open field arable        │  132,000    │    --     │    --     │\r\n│ Improved pasture         │     --      │  52,000   │    --     │\r\n│ Inferior pasture         │     --      │    --     │  19,800   │\r\n│ Improved fen             │     --      │  50,000   │    --     │\r\n│ Woodland                 │     --      │    --     │   1,000   │\r\n│ Waste and unimproved fen │  150,000    │    --     │    --     │\r\n│ Half-yearly meadow land  │    2,000    │    --     │    --     │\r\n│ Highland common          │    7,500    │    --     │    --     │\r\n│ Fen or moor common       │    8,000    │    --     │    --     │\r\n│ Heath and sheepwalk      │    6,000    │    --     │    --     │\r\n│                          ├─────────────┼───────────┼───────────┤\r\n│                          │  305,500    │ 117,000   │  20,800   │\r\n│                          ╘═════════════╧═══════════╧═══════════╡\r\n│              Total area, 443,300 acres.                        │\r\n└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe actual area of Cambridgeshire is 549,723 acres; but Vancouver was\r\nan exact and careful observer, and the proportions between the areas\r\nassigned to each description were no doubt reasonably accurate. Here\r\nwe find over two-thirds of the total area unenclosed, and more than\r\neight-ninths of the arable land. It is, of course, possible, probable\r\neven, that a larger amount than 15,000 acres of open field arable had\r\nundergone enclosure, and that the 52,000 acres of improved pasture\r\nincludes a good deal of such land, laid down in grass on enclosure.\r\nBut even if we included the whole, there would only be 67,000 acres of\r\nancient common field arable which had undergone enclosure, compared\r\nwith 132,000 acres still open.\r\n\r\nVancouver also gives detailed accounts of ninety-eight of the\r\nCambridgeshire parishes, eighty-three of which were open, fifteen\r\nenclosed. Of those which were open in 1793, seventy-four have since\r\nbeen enclosed by Act of Parliament, nine have not, viz., Babraham,\r\nBoxworth, Downham, Ely, Littleport, Lolworth, Madingley, Soham and Over.\r\n\r\nBabraham had 1,350 acres of common field, and Vancouver says that\r\nenclosure was desired. It was completely effected before the date of\r\ntithe commutation.\r\n\r\nBoxworth had 900 acres of common field. “The whole of this parish,”\r\nsays Vancouver, “lies within a ring fence and containing 2,100 acres,\r\nis the property of one gentlemen.” Vancouver’s acres, as we have seen,\r\nare large ones; the actual area is 2,526 acres. Enclosure was effected\r\nbefore the date of tithe commutation, and as might be supposed under\r\nthe circumstances, without an Act.\r\n\r\nDownham had, according to Vancouver, 680 acres of common field; the\r\ntithe map indicates 450 acres still remaining.\r\n\r\nTo Ely he assigns 2,100 acres of common field. This had all gone at the\r\ntime of tithe commutation.\r\n\r\nOf 345 acres assigned to Littleport, a remnant of forty acres survived\r\nto be recorded in the tithe map.\r\n\r\nThe common field land of Lolworth suffered no diminution; for while\r\nVancouver gives it 650 acres, the tithe map indicates 800 acres. They\r\nwere enclosed at the time of the Crimean war by common agreement of the\r\nowners, without an Act. This was the last surviving common field parish\r\nin the vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn Soham enclosure was nearly as slow. Vancouver assigns it 1,200 acres\r\nof common field; the tithe map 1,100 acres.\r\n\r\nMadingley, Vancouver says, had 1,030 acres of common field. These were\r\nall enclosed before the date of tithe commutation.\r\n\r\nFor Over the Board of Agriculture has no tithe documents; but we may\r\nadd that Horseheath had about 750 acres of common field, out of a total\r\nof 1,850 acres, according to the tithe map.\r\n\r\nOf the fifteen parishes stated by Vancouver to have been enclosed\r\nbefore 1793, only two were enclosed by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the information obtained from the Acts, the tithe\r\ndocuments, and Vancouver’s report is as follows:--\r\n\r\nOf the 152 agricultural parishes of Cambridgeshire, we know the date of\r\nenclosure of 118, enclosed by Acts of Parliament. These are given in\r\nAppendix B.\r\n\r\nOf thirteen, viz., Arrington, Childerley, Chippingham, Hatley St.\r\nGeorge, Leverington, Newton in the Isle of Ely, Outwell, Tadlow, Tid\r\nSt. Giles, Upwell-cum-Welney, and Wisbeach St. Mary, we know that they\r\nwere enclosed without Acts before 1793. The date 1790 is given for\r\nChippingham, and a small remnant of common field survived till 1851 in\r\nNewton.\r\n\r\nFour parishes were enclosed, not by Acts, between 1793 and the date of\r\ntithe commutation--Babraham, Boxworth, Ely and Madingley.\r\n\r\nFive parishes which were not entirely enclosed even at the date of\r\ntithe commutation have not been enclosed by Act since. These are\r\nLolworth, which then had only about one-fifth of its area enclosed;\r\nHorseheath, which was about half enclosed; Soham, which had about 1,100\r\nacres of common field and 456 acres of common, out of a total area of\r\nnearly 13,000 acres; and Downham and Littleport, which had respectively\r\n450 and forty acres of common field remaining.\r\n\r\nOf one parish, Over, we only know that it was open in 1793.\r\n\r\nOf nine parishes, Borough Green, Croydon-cum-Clapton, East Hatley,\r\nPapworth St. Agnes, Long Stanton, Westley Waterless, Wisbeach St.\r\nPeter, Witcham and Witchford, we only know that they were enclosed\r\nbefore the date of tithe commutation.\r\n\r\nOf two, Little Gransden and Stanground, we have no information.\r\n\r\nI have before laid stress upon the eastward march of enclosure in the\r\nmidlands during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries,\r\nwhich the following comparison illustrates:--\r\n\r\n┌───────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│           │              Parliamentary Enclosure.        │\r\n│           ├───────────────────────┬──────────────────────┤\r\n│   --      │ In the 18th Century.  │ In the 19th Century. │\r\n│           ├─────────┬─────────────┼─────────┬────────────┤\r\n│           │  Acts.  │    Acres.   │  Acts.  │    Acres.  │\r\n├───────────┼─────────┼─────────────┼─────────┼────────────┤\r\n│ Warwick   │    91   │   124,828   │    23   │    24,731  │\r\n│ Cambridge │    23   │    51,028   │    85   │   147,311  │\r\n└───────────┴─────────┴─────────────┴─────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nCelia Fiennes traversed the county. She describes the part from\r\nLittlebery (in Essex) to Cambridge as entirely open (p. 48), and makes\r\nno mention of enclosures in the description of the view from the\r\n“Hogmogoge Hills” (p. 49), but she speaks of “good enclosure” between\r\nCambridge and Huntingdon.\r\n\r\nThough Cambridgeshire was on the whole so late in undergoing enclosure,\r\nthe conversion of arable into tillage had so far proceeded that about\r\none-fifth of the county was included in the Inquisition of 1517, and it\r\nwas found that in this part 1,422 acres had been enclosed and converted\r\ninto parks or pasture (Leadam, “Domesday of Inclosures”).\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTINGDON.\r\n\r\nGeorge Maxwell, the Board of Agriculture reporter, says that Huntingdon\r\ncontains one hundred and six towns and hamlets, of which forty-one were\r\nthen (1793) wholly enclosed, and of the remaining sixty-five a very\r\nconsiderable part was enclosed. He computes that about a half of the\r\n“high land part” of the county, which would, of course, include all old\r\narable land, was still unenclosed (“Agriculture of Huntingdon,” p. 16).\r\n\r\nFifty-eight parishes were enclosed by Acts subsequently to the date of\r\nhis report, and one parish (Lutton) remained open to the date of tithe\r\ncommutation. This leaves six out of the sixty-five open or partially\r\nenclosed parishes of his report, in which enclosure was completed by\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century without any Act.\r\n\r\nOf the forty-one parishes wholly enclosed before 1793, twenty were\r\nenclosed by Acts of Parliament, leaving twenty-one parishes which might\r\nhave been enclosed contemporaneously without Acts, or to be assigned to\r\nthe time previous to the beginning of Parliamentary enclosure.\r\n\r\nSome of this enclosure is certainly to be assigned to an early date.\r\nCelia Fiennes, as we have seen, found more enclosure as she came to\r\nHuntingdon from Cambridge. Leland also found enclosure in the smaller\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n“From Cambridge to Elteste village al by champeyne counterey 8 miles.\r\nSt. Neotes 4 miles. From St. Neotes to Stoughton Village by sum\r\nenclosid ground a 3 Miles, it is in Huntendunshir. From Stoughton to\r\nMeichdown Village a 4 Miles be much Pasture and Corne ground ... there\r\nbe goodly Gardens, Orchards, Ponds, and a Parke thereby.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EASTERN COUNTIES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EAST MIDLANDS\r\n\r\nSECTION 2.\r\n\r\n  Map of Norfolk, Suffolk and part of Essex showing land enclosed:\r\n      before the General Enclosure Act of 1801.\r\n      between 1802 and 1845.\r\n      under General Enclosure Act of 1845.\r\n  Scale 1:1,000,000 or 1 inch = 15.78 Stat. miles.]\r\n\r\nThe story of the enclosure of Essex and Suffolk is almost completely\r\ntold by the map. Each is sharply divided into a larger part very\r\nanciently enclosed, without Acts of Parliament, and a smaller part\r\nclose to the boundaries of Hertford, Cambridge, and Norfolk, which\r\nwas enclosed at a late date by Acts of Parliament. Essex has but one\r\nAct belonging to the eighteenth century, and that is dated as late as\r\n1795. Suffolk has nine Acts belonging to the eighteenth, and forty-four\r\nbelonging to the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe additional information available only serves to bring out more\r\nclearly the very striking contrast between the regions of ancient and\r\nrecent enclosure.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand we find that the Parliamentary enclosure of the extreme\r\nwest and north-west portion of Essex is only part of the recent\r\nenclosure of that part.\r\n\r\nThe Enclosure Acts cover twenty-nine parishes, and an area of 22,000\r\nacres, about 760 acres per parish. Vancouver, who reported on Essex, as\r\nwell as Cambridge, tells us, “The arable land in about forty parishes\r\nlies very much in open common fields, and which in point of quantity\r\nis found to average 1,200 acres per parish.”[96] He gives a list of\r\nopen field parishes; Thraxted and Streethall, which have not since been\r\nenclosed by Act, are included; and each of those had some common field\r\nat the time of tithe commutation.\r\n\r\n [96] “Agriculture of Essex,” p. 185.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he tells us that the neighbourhood of Great Dunmow,\r\nwhich is quite close to the region of nineteenth century enclosure, had\r\nbeen enclosed from time immemorial.[97]\r\n\r\n [97] _Ibid._, p. 195.\r\n\r\nThe well-known passage in the “Discourse of the Commonweal,” “Countries\r\nwheare most Inclosures be, are most wealthie, as essex, kent,\r\ndevenshire, and such,” sufficiently establishes the ancient enclosure\r\nof the greater part of Essex. And though the evidence is not very\r\nfull, it is, I think, sufficient to show that the enclosure of the\r\ncorresponding part of Suffolk had a similar history. Celia Fiennes says\r\nthat the journey from Ipswich to Woodbridge is “7 miles mostly Lanes,\r\nEnclosed countrys”; and from Woodbridge to Saxmundham “The wayes are\r\npretty deep, mostly Lanes, very little Commons” (p. 107).\r\n\r\nJohn Norden (1602) also makes mention of Suffolk methods of hedging.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises with regard to this region of ancient\r\nenclosure in Essex and Suffolk, whether it ever passed through the\r\ntypical English common field system. To this question we are able to\r\ngive an unhesitating answer.\r\n\r\nIn Suffolk, far away from any other Parliamentary enclosure, in the\r\nsouth-east corner of the county are the parishes of Orford and Iken.\r\nThe enclosure at Orford was in 1881. There were but forty-six acres to\r\nenclose, and these lay in strips alternately belonging to the lord of\r\nthe manor and to the Corporation of Orford. The existence of corporate\r\nproperty in this small spot of land preserved it from enclosure to such\r\na late date.\r\n\r\nThe case of Iken appears to have been somewhat similar. It was enclosed\r\nin 1804. There was only the small area of 100 acres to enclose,\r\ncomprising “certain open and common fields, meadows, commonable lands,\r\nand waste grounds.” The Marquis of Hertford was lord of the manor, and\r\nsix individuals by name, and “divers others” are said to be the other\r\nproprietors of land. There is a special clause authorising the parish\r\nauthorities, if they will, to accept rents from the Marquis of Hertford\r\nin lieu of allotments, so there must have been corporate property in\r\nthe commonable lands, and this no doubt accounted for the survival of\r\nthis small area of common field.\r\n\r\nBut the clearest evidence is from the town of Colchester. The borough\r\nis of great extent, and includes the four agricultural parishes of\r\nGreenstead, Bere Church, or West Donyland, Lexden and Mile End. In\r\nthese four parishes, says Vancouver, “one-third of the arable land lies\r\nin half-yearly common fields” (p. 40). The Corporation of Colchester\r\nis to this day a very large owner of arable land; how it was enclosed,\r\nand how the Corporation, as distinct from the free-men, secured the\r\nproperty after the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, I\r\ndo not know. The important point is conveyed in the word “half-yearly.”\r\nThe arable fields of Colchester were genuine common fields, subject to\r\nrights of common of pasture after harvest.\r\n\r\nI think there can be little doubt that though much of Essex and Suffolk\r\nmight have been ancient woodland, and have been enclosed directly\r\nfrom that condition, the primitive village community of Essex was\r\napproximately of the same type as that of central England.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORFOLK.\r\n\r\nAdequate material does not exist for a statistical survey of the\r\nenclosure of Norfolk, because of the disappointing habit which the\r\npromoters of Enclosure Acts for this county fell into about the year\r\n1793,[98] and persisted in later, of not making any statement with\r\nregard to the area covered by the Act. The best statement that we\r\ncan make is that 297 parishes out of 682 were enclosed by Act of\r\nParliament.[99]\r\n\r\n [98] Before 1793 thirty-one parishes were enclosed by twenty-two Acts,\r\n the area covered by nineteen of which is stated, amounting altogether\r\n to 50,187 acres. The total area so enclosed was probably not less than\r\n 54,000 acres.\r\n\r\n [99] There were also eighty Enclosure Acts for the enclosure of common\r\n waste or pasture merely. In these also the area is stated for a small\r\n minority only.\r\n\r\nWe have already dealt with some peculiar features of Norfolk\r\nagriculture revealed by preambles of Enclosure Acts. The chief other\r\nfact which is striking in its enclosure history is that the county is\r\ndivided by the chalk ridge, which passes through the centre of the\r\ncounty, from north to south, and which reaches the coast at Cromer,\r\ninto two parts of approximately equal area. The patches of colour which\r\nindicate enclosure by Act of Parliament are scattered indifferently\r\nover the whole map of the county; but the significance of the colour\r\nvaries. East Norfolk has all the aspect of a country of very early\r\nenclosure. The fields are small, the hedges are big and high, like\r\nDevonshire hedges, the roads are narrow and winding. The aspect recalls\r\nKent’s previously quoted words. “There is a considerable deal of common\r\nfield land in Norfolk, though a much smaller proportion than in many\r\nother counties; for notwithstanding common rights for great cattle\r\nexist in all of them, and even sheepwalk privileges in many, yet the\r\nnatural industry of the people is such, that whenever a person can\r\nget 5 or 6 acres together, he plants a white-thorn edge round it, and\r\nsets an oak at every rod distance, which is consented to by a kind\r\nof general courtesy from one neighbour to another” (“Agriculture of\r\nNorfolk,” 1st Edition, p. 22). The Parliamentary enclosure which took\r\nplace in a parish where the neighbours had been showing this courtesy\r\nto one another consisted mainly in the extinction of common rights over\r\nenclosed land.\r\n\r\nThe making of hedges had proceeded to such an extent in East Norfolk\r\nby the end of the seventeenth century, that an anonymous author who\r\nbrought out an annotated edition of Tusser’s “Five hundred points\r\nof Husbandry,” and “Champion and Severall,” under the title “Tusser\r\nRedivivus,” in the year 1710, explains the term “woodland” (a term\r\nwhich Tusser really used as a synonym for “several” or enclosed land)\r\nto mean East Norfolk, saying that this district was so much enclosed in\r\nsmall fields with fine trees in the hedges, that it was known as “the\r\nWoodlands.”\r\n\r\nAt this time the western half of the county was still almost entirely\r\nopen. Arthur Young wrote in 1771, “From forty to sixty years ago, all\r\nthe Northern and Western and a part of the Eastern tracts of the county\r\nwere sheepwalks, let so low as from 6_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ and 2_s._ an\r\nacre. Much of it was in this condition only thirty years ago. The great\r\nimprovements have been made by reason of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n(1) By enclosing without the assistance of Parliament.\r\n\r\n(2) By a spirited use of marle and clay.\r\n\r\n(3) By the introduction of an excellent course of crops.\r\n\r\n(4) The cultivation of hand hoed turnips.\r\n\r\n(5) Clover and ray grass.\r\n\r\n(6) Long leases.\r\n\r\n(7) By the county being divided chiefly into large farms.\r\n\r\n“Parliamentary inclosures are scarcely ever so complete and general as”\r\n(non-Parliamentary enclosure) “in Norfolk” (“Eastern Tour,” Vol. II.,\r\np. 150).\r\n\r\nWilliam Marshall supplies a confirmatory note. “Norfolk, it is probable\r\n(speaking generally of the county), has not borne grain, in abundance,\r\nmuch above a century. During the passed century” (the eighteenth) “a\r\nprincipal part of it was _fresh land_, a newly discovered country\r\nin regard to grain crops” (“Review of the Reports to the Board of\r\nAgriculture for the Eastern Department,” p. 314).\r\n\r\nEnclosure in the western half of Norfolk and along the central chalk\r\nridge in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, whether common field\r\narable were included or not, meant the reverse of what it had meant\r\nin the first half of the sixteenth century--the conversion of land\r\nfrom sheeprun to arable land and to highly cultivated land. Kent, in a\r\nsecond edition of his report of Norfolk, published in 1796, estimated\r\nthat two-thirds of the whole area of the county was then arable; and\r\nof the arable land three-quarters was enclosed, one-quarter in common\r\nfield. In other words, one-half of the area of the county was enclosed\r\narable, one-sixth common field arable. The remainder he describes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Meadows, parks, and upland pasture       126,692 acres.\r\n  Unimproved commons                        80,000   ″\r\n  Marsh lands                               63,346   ″\r\n  Warrens and sheepwalks                    63,346   ″\r\n\r\nwith small areas for woods, plantations, roads, lakes, rivers, and\r\nswamps. Whatever ancient common field arable had been enclosed before\r\nthe beginning of the eighteenth century and converted into pasture, was\r\napparently re-converted into arable before the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN MIDLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDDLESEX.\r\n\r\nI have found very little information with regard to the enclosure\r\nof Middlesex beyond that obtained from the Enclosure Acts. It is\r\nremarkable that these should cover so large a part (19·7 per cent.) of\r\nthe area of the county.\r\n\r\nOf twenty-six Acts, covering 35,757 acres, twenty-three, covering\r\n30,000 acres, belong to the period after 1793. The Board of Agriculture\r\nreporters, Thomas Baird and Peter Foot, tell us respectively (1) that\r\nthere were about 50,000 acres under tillage in 1793 (“Agriculture\r\nof Middlesex,” p. 7), and (2) “The Common Fields in the county of\r\nMiddlesex, which are at present in a good course of husbandry, form\r\na large proportion as to the number of acres when compared to the\r\ncultivated enclosures” (_Ibid._ p. 72).\r\n\r\nThat the common fields were “in a good course of husbandry” very\r\nprobably means that the exercise of common rights had been largely\r\nrestricted, and it is not improbable that while some of the ancient\r\ncommon fields of Middlesex became converted into small dairy farms,\r\nothers became market gardens by means of a very moderate amount of\r\ninterchanging of properties and holdings.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERTFORDSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe county of Hertford is rather remarkable for the extent of open\r\nfield land (common rights have so far decayed that one can hardly call\r\nit common field) persisting to the present day. Notes have already been\r\ngiven on Hitchin, Bygrave, Clothall, and Wallington. There were further\r\nno less than seventeen enclosures under the Act of 1845, a number only\r\nsurpassed by Oxfordshire, and in a number of other parishes small\r\nremnants of common fields are indicated by the tithe maps.\r\n\r\nBut on the whole Hertfordshire was a county of early enclosure. When\r\nthe Board of Agriculture survey was made only four parishes and a\r\npart of Hitchin had undergone Parliamentary enclosure; but the\r\nreporter says, “There are several small common fields in this county,\r\nbut these are mostly by agreement among the owners and occupiers\r\ncultivated nearly in the same way as in the enclosed state” (D. Walker,\r\n“Agriculture of Hertfordshire,” p. 49).\r\n\r\nWalter Blyth in 1649 included “Hartford” with “Essex, Kent, Surrey,\r\nSussex,” etc., as enclosed counties (“The English Improver,” p. 49).\r\n\r\n“An insurrection in hertfordshire for the comens at Northall and\r\nCheshunt,” was, according to Hales, the first beginning of the\r\nenclosure riots and rebellions in the reign of Edward VI.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable that Hertford was in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries so much more enclosed than the surrounding\r\ncounties, than Middlesex as well as than Bedford and Cambridge, and\r\neven more enclosed than the part of Essex immediately adjoining.\r\n\r\nLeland gives no account of the condition of the county with regard to\r\nenclosure; but as no earlier author than Blyth speaks of Hertford as\r\nan enclosed county, I am inclined to believe that its enclosure mainly\r\ntook place in the sixteenth and in the first half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. It is to be noticed that Hertford was excluded from the\r\noperation of the last (39 Elizabeth, c. 2) of the Depopulation Acts,\r\nrequiring that all old arable land should continue under tillage and be\r\ncultivated according to the local custom.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\nBuckingham is, on the whole, a county of late enclosure. A large\r\nproportion (34·2 per cent.) of the area was enclosed by Acts of\r\nParliament; two-thirds of this enclosure belonging to the eighteenth\r\nand one-third to the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe reporters to the Board of Agriculture, William James and Jacob\r\nMalcolm, supply a list of the parishes containing common fields in\r\n1794, with an approximate statement of the area. The majority of these\r\nparishes have, of course, undergone Parliamentary enclosure since. By\r\ncomparing their list with that of the Enclosure Acts and with the\r\nsummary of the tithe documents, we find that the following seventeen\r\nparishes were enclosed without Acts between 1794 and the date of tithe\r\ncommutation:--\r\n\r\n          Astwood\r\n          Buckland\r\n          Dinton\r\n          Drayton Beauchamp\r\n          Halton\r\n          Great Hampden\r\n          Little Hampden\r\n          Hedgerley\r\n          Horsendon\r\n          Great Horwood\r\n          Ickford\r\n          Marsh Gibbon\r\n          Medmenham\r\n          Great Missenden\r\n          Little Missenden\r\n          Newton Longueville\r\n          Quainton\r\n\r\nThe following five still had remains of common field at the time of\r\ntithe commutation, though the area was considerably reduced in each\r\ncase:--\r\n\r\n┌────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐\r\n│                            │    Common Field Acreage.    │\r\n│           ----             ├──────────────┬──────────────┤\r\n│                            │   In 1794.   │ According to │\r\n│                            │              │  Tithe Map.  │\r\n├────────────────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n│                            │    Acres.    │    Acres.    │\r\n│ Burnham and Lower Boveney  │    1000      │     525      │\r\n│ Chesham                    │     300      │      66      │\r\n│ Dorney                     │     600      │     277      │\r\n│ Eton                       │     300      │     181      │\r\n│ Chipping Wycombe           │     200      │     100      │\r\n└────────────────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘\r\n\r\nAs so much gradual non-Parliamentary enclosure took place during the\r\nnineteenth century, it is to be supposed that the same process was also\r\ngoing on right through the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nBuckingham is traversed by the Chiltern Hills, and so is divided into\r\ntwo distinct regions. About half the county lies north-west of the\r\nChilterns, on a sub-cretaceous formation, like Bedfordshire, with\r\nfertile soil, and villages thickly scattered. The remainder consists of\r\nthe chalky downs and the later formations, like most of Hertfordshire\r\nand Middlesex.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure of the south-east portion was earlier than that of the\r\nnorth-west part. Arthur Young in 1771 was much struck by the extent\r\nof the open fields in the latter part. The vale of Aylesbury,[100]\r\nhe says, was good clay, and open field (“Eastern Tour,” p. 18). From\r\nAylesbury to Buckingham “nearly the whole country is open field, the\r\nsoil among the richest I ever saw, black putrid clay” (p. 19). “As\r\nfor the landlords, what in the name of wonder is the reason of their\r\nnot enclosing! All this vale would make as fine meadows as any in\r\nthe world” (p. 23). However, about Hockston (Hoggeston) he saw many\r\nnew enclosures (p. 24). Hoggeston itself was never enclosed by Act,\r\nbut several neighbouring villages had been enclosed by Acts passed\r\npreviously to 1771.\r\n\r\n [100] An Act for the enclosure of the common field land of Aylesbury\r\n itself was passed in the same year.\r\n\r\nCelia Fiennes passed through the same part of Buckinghamshire about\r\neighty years before. From Stony Stratford to Great Horwood, she says,\r\n“this country is fruitfull, full of woods, Enclosures, and rich Ground.\r\nThe little towns stand pretty thicke. You have many in view” (p. 97).\r\nThis does not imply anything more than very partial enclosure; for\r\nCelia Fiennes, accustomed to the complete absence of hedges of her own\r\npart of Wiltshire, always notices enclosure rather than the absence of\r\nenclosure. That many little towns should be in sight of one passing\r\nthrough a flat country implies that it is open, except close to the\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\nLeland, in 1536, came from Bedfordshire along the boundary between\r\nHerts and Bucks and into the extreme south of Buckinghamshire, and\r\nfound that enclosures had already begun. He describes the whole county\r\nin one luminous sentence, “Looke as the countrye of the Vale of\r\nAlesbury for the most part is clean barren of wood, and is champaine,\r\nsoe is all the Chilterne well woodid and full of Enclosures” (fol. 192\r\na).\r\n\r\nIt seems quite clear, then, that the enclosure movement of the\r\nsouth-east of Berkshire was ancient; that it moved up the long slope\r\nof the Chilterns from the Thames and Middlesex, but stopped at the\r\nopen chalk downs which marked the summit of the range; and that the\r\nmovement which affected the enclosure of the Vale of Aylesbury and\r\nall north-western Buckinghamshire was part of the general enclosure\r\nmovement of the Midlands, spreading southwards from Leicester and\r\nNorthampton, as we have seen it spread eastwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXFORD.\r\n\r\nOxfordshire may be termed a sister county to Buckinghamshire; but by\r\nfar the greater part of the county lies north-west of the Chiltern\r\nHills, which occupy the south east extremity. We find, as we should\r\nexpect, that the history of the enclosure of Oxfordshire resembles that\r\nof Bedfordshire and of North-West Buckinghamshire; 45·6 per cent. of\r\nthe area of Oxfordshire underwent Parliamentary enclosure compared with\r\n46·0 per cent. of Bedfordshire and 34·2 per cent. of Bucks; in Oxford\r\nabout 62 per cent. of the total Parliamentary enclosure belonged to the\r\neighteenth century, in Bedford 54 per cent., in Buckinghamshire 66 per\r\ncent. Oxford, however, is remarkable for the extent of the enclosure\r\n(eighteen Acts enclosing 23,578 acres) under the General Enclosure Act\r\nof 1845.\r\n\r\nRichard Davis, the Board of Agriculture reporter, while he gives a very\r\nfull statement of the methods of cultivating the common fields of the\r\ncounty, makes no statement with regard to their extent.\r\n\r\nAs in Buckinghamshire, partial enclosure, particularly in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the villages, had taken place before the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Celia Fiennes found “Oxford Environ’d round with woods\r\nand Enclosure, yet not so neare as to annoy the town which stands\r\npleasant and Compact,” and from the Malvern Hills she says “Oxford,\r\nGloucestershire, &c. appears in plaines, enclosures, woods and rivers\r\nand many great hills” (p. 33). By “plaines” stretches of common fields\r\nare to be understood.\r\n\r\nLeland found no enclosure in Oxfordshire in any part he visited.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\nLincoln and the East Riding of Yorkshire have a similar enclosure\r\nhistory. Each was largely enclosed by Acts of Parliament; in each\r\nnearly four-fifths of the Parliamentary enclosure was effected in\r\nthe eighteenth century; in each enclosure was not marked either by a\r\ngeneral conversion of arable into pasture, as in Leicestershire, or by\r\na general conversion of pasture into arable, as in Norfolk; in both a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the common-field land before enclosure was\r\nworked on the two-field system. As much as 40·1 per cent. of the East\r\nRiding of Yorkshire is covered by the Acts for enclosing common-field\r\nparishes, and 29·3 per cent. of Lincolnshire; but for the latter\r\ncounty there are also Acts for enclosing great extents of commonable\r\nmarshes; and including these and other Acts for enclosing commons and\r\nwastes, about 35 per cent. of Lincolnshire has undergone Parliamentary\r\nenclosure.\r\n\r\nA good deal of non-Parliamentary enclosure took place during the\r\nnineteenth century. Thomas Stone, the Board of Agriculture reporter,\r\nestimates that there were in 1793, 200,000 acres of commons, wastes,\r\nand unimbanked salt marshes, and 268,000 acres of common fields. He\r\nover-estimates the total area of the county so much, that to rectify\r\nhis figures we have to deduct 10 per cent.--this leaves 421,000 acres\r\nof common fields and other commonable lands. There have been enclosed\r\nby Parliamentary action since 207,659 acres by Acts for enclosing\r\ncommon-field parishes, and about 74,000 acres by Acts for enclosing\r\nother commonable lands; if we suppose there are 12,000 acres of\r\ncommon fields and commons surviving, this accounts for 293,659 acres,\r\nand leaves about 127,000 acres unaccounted for--_i.e._, enclosed by\r\nnon-Parliamentary process during the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIf the same proportion between the scope of the two methods be\r\nsupposed to have held good during the earlier part of the period of\r\nParliamentary enclosure, it would follow that at the beginning of that\r\nperiod (1730) Lincolnshire was about half enclosed and half open.\r\n\r\nFrom the references to Lincolnshire by our tourists, one would expect\r\nto find a less degree of enclosure. Arthur Young, in 1768, that is,\r\nafter fifty-three Enclosure Acts for Lincolnshire had been passed,\r\nfound the country from Stamford to Grimsthorpe mostly open (“Northern\r\nTour,” p. 77), from Grimsthorpe to Colsterworth chiefly open,\r\nColsterworth to Grantham, enclosed on the right hand, open on the left\r\n(p. 84), and from Grantham to Newark all open (p. 94). Celia Fiennes,\r\nabout 1695, following the same road, found no enclosures but a “fine\r\nchampion country.” Leland gives the same testimony.\r\n\r\nBy comparing Celia Fiennes with Arthur Young, we have evidence of\r\nenclosure proceeding in the south-west of Lincolnshire between 1695 and\r\n1768, which is partly, but not entirely, accounted for by Parliamentary\r\nenclosure. The three descriptions give the impression that up to the\r\nbeginning of Parliamentary enclosure Lincolnshire was much less than\r\nhalf enclosed. It is, however, not difficult to reconcile this with the\r\nconclusion inferred from Thomas Stone’s statement and the Enclosure\r\nActs; for none of the three travellers touched more than the western\r\npart of the county. No doubt the eastern part was earlier enclosed.\r\nThis is, indeed, indicated by the distribution of Parliamentary\r\nenclosure, as shown by the map.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EAST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE.\r\n\r\nWe have no estimate of the extent of common-field land in the East\r\nRiding from the Board of Agriculture reporter; but Arthur Young, in his\r\n“Northern Tour,” describes the part betwene Sheffield and Goole and\r\nthe East Riding as about half open and half enclosed (pp. 172–210). He\r\nfurther says (p. 178) that in the East Riding “Inclosures and turnpikes\r\nwere carried on with great spirit during the late war” (_i.e._, “The\r\nSeven Years’ War”). Nine Acts were passed for the enclosure of eleven\r\nparishes during that war; but this can only have been a part of the\r\nspirited proceedings.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Bedfordshire, when we allow for marshes along the\r\nHumber, and hill country on the Wolds, which never passed through the\r\ncommon-field system, for the indubitable non-Parliamentary enclosure\r\nproceeding side by side with Parliamentary enclosure, and particularly\r\nfor the active enclosure spoken of by Arthur Young in the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century, there remains but little enclosure of common\r\nfields to be attributed to earlier centuries. Some such enclosure must\r\nbe assigned to the sixteenth century. The Commission of 1517 inquired\r\ninto nearly the whole riding and found 1560 acres of arable land\r\nenclosed, 1545 acres of which were laid down to grass (W. S. Leadam,\r\n“The Domesday of Inclosure”).\r\n\r\nLeland also found some enclosure in the East Riding, which he traversed\r\npretty completely. (_See_ Appendix C.)\r\n\r\nWe have mention of a park and of enclosed land in four different\r\nplaces, though in each of the four only for about a mile of the route.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH AND WEST RIDINGS.\r\n\r\nThe North and West Ridings of Yorkshire were much earlier enclosed\r\nthan the East Riding. This is the natural consequence of the fact that\r\nin early times they possessed a much smaller proportion of arable\r\nland, and, as I have shown in a previous chapter, the more pasture\r\npredominates, the less the common-field arable is able to resist the\r\ntendency to enclosure. The difference between the proportions of the\r\nthree ridings covered by Enclosure Acts, by which common fields were\r\nenclosed is striking: East Riding 40·1 per cent., West Riding 11·6,\r\nNorth Riding 6·3. But this understates the case, for I include all\r\nActs whereby any arable common field at all is enclosed, and in the\r\nNorth and West Ridings many of these Acts are for the enclosure of a\r\ngreat stretch of moor and a mere remnant of common field, and these\r\nunduly swell the total. Examples are an Act in 1791 for the enclosure\r\nof 6000 acres of common, and 30 acres of “mesne inclosures,” _i.e._, of\r\nintermixed tilled land which is separated from the surrounding common\r\npasture by a hedge; an Act in 1801 for the enclosure of 150 acres\r\nof common field and common meadow, and 4000 acres of common pasture\r\nat Kettlewell and Conistree; an Act in 1815 for the enclosure of a\r\nwretched remnant of nine acres of common field arable, and 6330 acres\r\nof common. The existence of such remnants of common field arable bears\r\nwitness to the gradual enclosure which would have entirely extinguished\r\nthem a little later, if the opportunity of the enclosure of the\r\ncommons had not been seized to bring them also within the scope of the\r\nActs.\r\n\r\nWilliam Marshall’s account of the enclosure of the Vale of Pickering\r\nhas already been given. Arthur Young in 1768 describes the view from\r\nthe road from Kirby Moorside to Cleveland as one of “extensive valleys\r\ncut into innumerable inclosures” (“Northern Tour,” Vol. II., p. 93).\r\nEnclosure was the rule all the way from Driffield northwards.\r\n\r\nCelia Fiennes kept more to the West Riding. From Darlington to\r\nRichmond, “I went through Lanes and Woods, an Enclosed country” (p.\r\n183). Richmond to Boroughbridge was for 3 or 4 miles through narrow\r\nlanes, then for 5 or 6 through common (p. 184). From Knaresborough to\r\nLeeds “it was much in Lanes and uphills and Downhills, some little part\r\nwas open common” (p. 184). From Leeds to Eland “much in enclosures”\r\n(p. 185). About Eland “all the hills full of inclosures” (_ibid._).\r\nFrom Eland to Blackstone Edge, “these parts have some resemblance to\r\nDarbyshire, only here are more woody places and inclosures” (p. 186).\r\n\r\nThe earlier history of the enclosure of most of the West Riding and\r\nNorth Riding is summed up in the passage from Walter Blyth:--“Woodlands\r\nwont before inclosure to be relieved by the Champion, and now become\r\ngallant corn countries.... West of Warwick, North of Worcester,\r\nStaffordshire, Shropshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and all the Countries\r\nthereabouts” (“English Improver,” p. 40). For while Celia Fiennes found\r\nso much enclosure, Leland found chiefly moor and forest, yet more\r\nenclosure than “Chaumpaine.”\r\n\r\nThe great contrast between the description given by Celia Fiennes\r\nand that given by Leland sufficiently confirms the statement of\r\nWalter Blyth, which we may amplify as follows:--Enclosure made\r\nlittle progress in Yorkshire before the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, but thenceforward it was pushed steadily on mainly by the\r\ntilling and enclosing of common wastes and pastures, and the clearing\r\nand cultivation of forests in the North and West Riding, and the\r\ncommon-field arable also underwent division and gradual enclosure. That\r\nthe Vale of Pickering in the North Riding and the district between\r\nSheffield and Goole in the West Riding, being the parts where arable\r\ncommon fields most predominated, were the last of the cultivated\r\ndistricts to be enclosed; the Vale of Pickering being mainly enclosed\r\nby non-Parliamentary means in the first half of the eighteenth century;\r\nthe South Yorkshire district being largely enclosed by Acts of\r\nParliament in the second half of the eighteenth and the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nLastly attention must be drawn to the great number of Acts of Enclosure\r\nfor Yorkshire enclosing common pasture or waste only.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTTINGHAMSHIRE.\r\n\r\nNottinghamshire may be said to consist of an ancient “champain”\r\ndistrict, which has an enclosure history exactly similar to that of the\r\nneighbouring districts of Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire, and an\r\nancient forest district.\r\n\r\nThe county as a whole has a percentage of Parliamentary enclosure,\r\n32·5, which must be considered high when allowance is made for the\r\nfact that so much land must have been enclosed directly from the\r\nforest state without passing through the common-field system. The two\r\nsurviving examples of common-field parishes, Laxton and Eakring, have\r\nbeen before described; Bole also was till recently unenclosed.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Agriculture reporter, Robert Lowe, attempted to give an\r\naccount of the state of enclosure of the different parishes in 1793,\r\nbut evidently found it beyond his powers to make the lists at all\r\ncomplete. But his list of unenclosed parishes enables us to give the\r\nfollowing nine parishes as enclosed without Parliamentary intervention\r\nsince 1793:--\r\n\r\n          Askham\r\n          Kirklington\r\n          Rampton\r\n          Saundby\r\n          Treswell\r\n          North Wheatley\r\n          South Wheatley\r\n          Kneesall\r\n          Widnerpool\r\n\r\ntogether with the hamlets of Ompton and Clipston.\r\n\r\nAnd his list of recently-enclosed parishes enables us to give the\r\nfollowing nine parishes as enclosed without Parliamentary sanction\r\nshortly before 1793:--\r\n\r\n          Bingham\r\n          Carcolston\r\n          Selston\r\n          Shelton\r\n          Cotham\r\n          Kneeton\r\n          Orston\r\n          Sibthorpe\r\n          Thoroton\r\n\r\ntogether with the hamlets of Aslacton, Newton, Oldwork, and Cropwell\r\nButler.\r\n\r\nAll these had been enclosed, he says, within the previous twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the extent of non-Parliamentary enclosure in Notts., in\r\nthe period from 1773 to 1793 is just equal, according to this, to that\r\nof the non-Parliamentary enclosure after 1793, is a slight clue to\r\nthe probable extent of non-Parliamentary enclosure in the eighteenth\r\ncentury in other counties similarly circumstanced.\r\n\r\nWe should expect, then, to find the part of the county which was\r\nanciently tilled, practically entirely open, at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century. This is confirmed by the evidence, so far as it\r\ngoes. Celia Fiennes says: “From Nottingham Castle I saw a prospect\r\nmore than 20 mile about. The land is very rich and fruitfull, so the\r\nGreen meadows with the fine corn ffields which seemes to bring forth in\r\nhandfulls. They soe most of Barley and have great encrease, there is\r\nall sorts of Graine besides, and plaines and Rivers and Great woods and\r\nLittle Towns all in view” (p. 56).\r\n\r\nLeland was similarly struck with South Nottingham. Coming south from\r\nRotherham he found “very woody Grounde,” then “hethy,” then “Corny and\r\nPaster,” then “Ground very fruteful of Corne” (Vol. V., fol. 91, 92).\r\nBut when he got past Nottingham the view made him burst into Latin.\r\n“After that I cam a little beyond Trent I saw all Champaine Grounde\r\nundecunque within sight, and very little wood but infinita frugum\r\ncopia.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDERBY.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure history of Derbyshire closely resembles that of the West\r\nRiding of Yorkshire. A somewhat larger part (16·5 per cent.) of it\r\nunderwent enclosure by Acts for the enclosure of common-field arable in\r\nconjunction with other commonable land, and about 5 per cent. more by\r\nActs for the enclosure of common pasture and waste. The common-field\r\narable is frequently called “mesne inclosures” (sometimes “mesne\r\nfield”), showing that the idea of a hedge was that it surrounded the\r\ncorn crops to keep out beasts, not the pasture to keep them in. Celia\r\nFiennes gives a general description of the county: “You see neither\r\nhedge nor tree but only low drye stone walls round some ground, Else\r\nits only hills and dales as thick as you Can Imagine” (p. 77). “All\r\nDarbyshire is but a world of peaked hills.”\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that it had by 1649, according to Blyth, become a\r\ngallant corn country through enclosure. Leland passed it by.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURHAM.\r\n\r\nThe history of the enclosure of Durham is told by the Board of\r\nAgriculture reporter in a sentence: “In this county the lands, or\r\ncommon fields of townships, were for the most part inclosed soon after\r\nthe Restoration.... The common fields are few in number and of small\r\nextent” (Joseph Granger, “Agriculture of Durham,” p. 43).\r\n\r\nAll other evidence simply confirms this statement. The Enclosure Acts\r\nfor enclosing common fields are but five in number, and the most\r\nextensive of them covers only 800 acres, of which part only is common\r\nfield. (The Enclosure Acts of the other type are numerous in comparison\r\nand extensive in scope, one covering 10,000, one 20,000, one 25,000 and\r\none 28,000 acres).\r\n\r\nThe statement, too, is confirmed by two contemporary authors,\r\npreviously quoted, and by the records of Leland and Celia Fiennes.\r\nCelia Fiennes says that from Newcastle to Durham “the whole county\r\nlooks like a fruitful woody place” (p. 178), and she compares it to the\r\nneighbourhood of Blackheath (p. 179), from which we must infer some\r\nopen common, but all the cultivated land in a state of enclosure.\r\n\r\nLeland traversed the whole county but found no enclosure. Nor does he\r\ndescribe any part of the county as “champaine” but merely as good corn,\r\nor grass, or moor, or mountain. It is, I think, safe to conclude that\r\nthere were no extensive stretches of common-field arable within view;\r\nbut also, one is inclined to infer that enclosure had not yet begun.\r\n\r\nFurther, there is an illuminating note from Arthur Young (1768): “Farms\r\nbecome large on entering Northumberland, after the small ones of\r\nYorkshire and Durham” (“Northern Tour,” Vol. III., p. 61).\r\n\r\nIt has to be borne in mind that the disorder on the Border checked the\r\ndevelopment of agriculture till the accession of James I., probably\r\nat least as far south as the North Riding of Yorkshire. With the\r\ngradual increase of population, and improvement of roads, cultivation\r\nspread over the wastes; first in Yorkshire, then in Durham, then in\r\nNorthumberland. At first the agent was a peasant, carving a small farm\r\nfor his own maintenance, later a landlord or farmer able to employ\r\nlabourers and work a large farm.\r\n\r\nThat the enclosure of Northumberland took place later than that of\r\nDurham, and was the work of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, is\r\non _a priori_ grounds probable, and is further indicated by the fact\r\nthat Celia Fiennes makes no mention of enclosure in her account of her\r\nride from the Scottish border into Durham. A further reference to the\r\nenclosure of Northumberland will be made when we come to Cumberland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH-EAST OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\n\r\nKent is certainly a county of very ancient enclosure. This is clearly\r\nindicated by the fact that not a single Act for the enclosure of common\r\nfield has been passed by the whole county. It is also witnessed by a\r\nwhole series of writers, from Boys, the Board of Agriculture reporter,\r\nwho says, “There are no Common Fields in Kent,”[101] to the author\r\nof the “Discourse of the Commonweal,” “those counties which be most\r\nenclosed, as essex, kent, devenshire.”\r\n\r\n [101] “Agriculture of Kent” (1796), p. 44.\r\n\r\nBut in Kent it would appear that if some investigator as careful as\r\nVancouver had at a somewhat earlier date reported on the agriculture\r\nof Kent, he would have found some remains of arable common fields\r\nin the far eastern corner of the county. William Lambarde, in the\r\n“Perambulation of Kent,” 1570, says: “The soile is for the most part\r\nbountifull, consisting indifferently of arable, pasture, meadow and\r\nwoodland. Howbeit of these wood occupieth the greatest portion even to\r\nthis day except it be towards the east, which coast is more champaigne\r\nthan the residue” (p. 3).\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred years later, Celia Fiennes says: “Canterbury to\r\nDover was a good road and a sort of Champion Country” (p. 103). It was\r\nopen, it was mainly arable land, but it differed in some respect from\r\nthe Champain of the Midlands; and again, a hundred years later, William\r\nMarshall writes in 1798 of the Isle of Thanet: “The whole country lies\r\nopen, excepting in the immediate environs of villages.... The present\r\nproductions, if we cut off the marsh lands, may be said to be arable\r\ncrops” (“Southern District,” Vol. II., p. 6).\r\n\r\nThis was written, it will be noticed, just after Boys had written his\r\nstatement that there were no common fields in Kent. We can reconcile\r\nthe two statements if we suppose that by the disuse of rights of\r\ncommon, and by the consolidation of scattered properties and holdings\r\nby mutual exchanges, the characteristics of common field had been\r\nabolished, while in consequence of there never having arisen any\r\ntendency to convert the arable land into pasture, no necessity for the\r\nexpensive labour of making hedges arose. But I have no evidence to show\r\nat what date the open arable land ceased to be common field.\r\n\r\nThe question arises whether the common-field system of the ordinary\r\nEnglish type ever existed in this part of Kent; and here again\r\nthere is no decisive evidence that I know of by which to answer the\r\nquestion. The fact that the similar question for Essex is answered in\r\nthe affirmative by the Colchester common fields perhaps counts for\r\nsomething; and that the Surrey common fields come at Croydon close\r\nto the county boundary, for a little more. At Eltham there is an old\r\ncharity called the Fifteen Penny Lands; only a few acres remain in the\r\nform of land, the rest having been sold and the proceeds invested;\r\nbut there still remains an acre described as “Land in East Field,\r\nDockland’s Shot.” In 1578 a member of the Roper family, perhaps\r\nMargaret Roper, the daughter of Sir Thomas More, or her husband,\r\nbequeathed to Eltham “a parcel of ground containing by estimation four\r\nacres, in the common field, called East Field.”[102] Eltham was a royal\r\nmanor, hence likely to preserve old customs to a later date than other\r\nmanors, and the arrangement of ancient common fields, particularly\r\ntowards Eltham Common, seems clearly traceable. In Addington, an\r\necclesiastical manor, it seems easy to trace the signs of ancient\r\ncommon, commonable meadow, and common fields.\r\n\r\n [102] Geo. Rathbone, “History of the Eltham Charities,” p. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEALD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Map of Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex showing\r\n      land enclosed:\r\n        before the General Enclosure Act of 1801.\r\n        between 1802 and 1845.\r\n        under General Enclosure Act of 1845.\r\n    Scale 1:1,000,000 or 1 inch = 15.78 Stat. miles.]\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Weald of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex appears never to\r\nhave passed through the common-field system. This is indicated in\r\nthe first place by the fact that there have been no Enclosure Acts\r\nfor enclosing common fields. Secondly, we have what may be termed\r\nthe expert evidence of William Marshall, the shrewdest of all the\r\neighteenth-century agricultural writers, and the only one really\r\ninterested in the origin and early history of the common-field system.\r\nHe says of the Maidstone district, “the entire district appears to\r\nhave been inclosed from the forest or pasture state. I observed not a\r\ntrace of common-field lands” (“Southern District,” Vol. I., p. 21). Of\r\nthe Weald of Kent, “The whole is in a state of inclosure, and mostly\r\ndivided by wide woodland belts, into well sized fields” (_Ibid._, p.\r\n345). Of the Weald of Sussex, “... there being, I believe, no trace at\r\npresent, of common fields having ever gained an establishment” (Vol.\r\nII., p. 100). “The whole of the district (between Pulborough and\r\nMidhurst) under view is in a state of Inclosure; except a few small\r\nheathlets and commons; and except a small remnant of common field in\r\nthe Maam soil.” The Maam soil, he says, is a vein of land of peculiar\r\nnature at the foot of the chalk hills, to be identified, presumably,\r\nwith the Gault formation.\r\n\r\nIn 1649, seeing that a considerable amount of common field survived\r\nin the part of Surrey north of the North Downs, until the time of\r\nParliamentary enclosure, and some in Sussex south of the South Downs,\r\nand in spite of this, Blith speaks of Surrey and Sussex as enclosed\r\ncounties, enclosure must at least have predominated in the Weald.\r\n\r\nCelia Fiennes adds a confirmation. Sussex, she says, is “much in\r\nblind, dark lanes” (p. 32). This implies narrow roads, with well-grown\r\nhedges, that is, ancient enclosure. For roads are everywhere broad in\r\nproportion as the industrial state at which enclosure takes place is\r\nadvanced. Again, from Calvery to Branklye, “the way is thro’ lanes,\r\nbeing an Enclosed Country for the most part, as is much of Sussex which\r\njoyns to Kent” (p. 112). And the view from Boxhill was that of “a\r\nfruitfull vale, full of inclosures and woods” (p. 32).\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH SURREY.\r\n\r\nThe part of Surrey which lies on the north slope of the North Downs,\r\nfrom the Kent boundary to the Bagshot sands, contained up till the time\r\nof Parliamentary enclosure a considerable proportion of common-field\r\nland, as may be seen by the appendix and the map.\r\n\r\nJames and Malcom, the reporters for Surrey, give a list of the chief\r\ncommon fields remaining in 1793 (“Agriculture of Surrey,” p. 43), from\r\nwhich we find that besides Merrow, enclosed about 1870, East and West\r\nClandon, Ashtead and Thorpe have been enclosed without Acts since. In\r\neach of these four cases enclosure took place before the date of tithe\r\ncommutation.\r\n\r\nBut even this part of Surrey must be considered as on the whole an\r\nearly enclosed district; as much so, in fact, as the corresponding\r\nslope of the Chiltern Hills, and the Hertfordshire Hills on the other\r\nside of the Thames.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA COAST OF SUSSEX.\r\n\r\nThe western part of the south slope of the Sussex Downs has a few\r\nexamples of common fields surviving to a late date, but they are fewer\r\nin number and smaller in area than on the north slope of the Surrey\r\nDowns. William Marshall says: “In the Isle of _Selsey_ I observed some\r\ncommon field land; also about Chichester, in the year 1791” (Southern\r\nDistrict, Vol. II., p. 230.) The accompanying map shows the parishes\r\nenclosed by Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESSEX.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of Wessex I include the counties of Hampshire,\r\nWiltshire, Berkshire and Dorset. There is a close resemblance\r\nbetween the enclosure history of each of these; while Gloucester is\r\na connecting link between them and the Midland counties on the one\r\nhand, and the south-western on the other. It may be described as at\r\npresent a country of very large farms, with a very large proportion\r\nof open down, the cultivated land itself remaining remarkably open,\r\nbeing divided in general into large rectangular fields by hedges\r\nwhich are frequently full of gaps. Rights of common here more than\r\nelsewhere have decayed, irrespective of actual enclosure; and using\r\nthe word enclosure in its broad sense, it may be said that in Wessex\r\nthe process of enclosure has least of all taken visible shape, either\r\nin the growing of hedges, or building of walls, or in the conversion\r\nof arable to pasture, or pasture to arable, or in the scattering of\r\nthe habitations of the inhabitants over the whole parish; but that\r\nit has most profoundly affected the social life of the villages. The\r\ncase of Grimstone, in which the nine “livings” for generations held by\r\nabout a dozen different copyholders, was converted into a single farm,\r\nand by no means an exceptionally large one, is typical of the whole\r\ndistrict. This aspect has been previously treated. What here has to\r\nbe noticed is that these characteristics of Wessex enclosure make it\r\nmore difficult to trace the progress, at least so far as the higher\r\nlands are concerned. If Celia Fiennes could revisit the neighbourhood\r\nof Amesbury and Stonehenge, she would probably again describe it as\r\n“all on the downs, a fine champion country.” It is fortunate that we\r\nhave the accounts of two such expert observers as Thomas Davis and\r\nWilliam Marshall. They wrote practically at the same date, Marshall\r\napparently in 1792, Davis in 1793; but as Marshall confines himself to\r\nthe actual condition, while Davis deals with the past, he must here\r\ntake precedence.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE WESTERN CHALK HILLS.\r\n\r\n“_Basingstoke to Salisbury._--The state of inclosure varies. To the\r\neastward the country is mostly inclosed, much of it in large, square,\r\nregular inclosures. More westward, it is entirely open; as are the tops\r\nof the higher hills throughout. Extensive views, with no other break,\r\nthan what is given by corn or flocks, fallows or the sheep fold.\r\n\r\n“_Environs of Salisbury._--To the southward of the town there are some\r\nwell-sized, square fields, with good live hedges (at least on three\r\nsides) apparently of forty or fifty years’ growth; yet, extraordinary\r\nas it is, many of these fields lie open to the roads; the fences on\r\nthe sides next the lanes lying in a state of neglect. And, to the\r\nnorth of the Avon, the country for many miles every way, lies open,\r\nunless about villages and hamlets, and along the narrow bottoms of the\r\nwatered valleys. To the eastward of Salisbury an attempt has been made\r\nat inclosure; the ruins of the hedges are still evident; broken banks,\r\nwith here and there a hawthorn. And similar instances are observable in\r\nother parts of the Downs.\r\n\r\n“Are we to infer from hence, that chalk down lands are not proper to be\r\nkept in a state of inclosure? Or that where sheep are kept in flocks,\r\nand few cattle are kept, fences are not requisite? Or is the foliage of\r\nshrubs a natural and favourite food of sheep, and hence, in a country\r\nchiefly stocked with sheep, it is difficult to preserve a live hedge\r\nfrom destruction?\r\n\r\n“_Ludgershall to Basingstoke._--The country is wholly inclosed:\r\nexcepting a few plots to the right; mostly in large square fields,\r\ndoubtless from a state of open down; the hedges in general of a Middle\r\nAge; some instances of vacant inclosure.\r\n\r\n“With respect to the present state of appropriation of this tract\r\nof country,[103] the mere traveller is liable to be deceived. From\r\nthe more public roads, the whole appears to be in a state of divided\r\nproperty. But on a closer examination, much of it is found to be in a\r\nstate of commonage. In the immediate environs of Salisbury, there are\r\nevident remains of a common field, lying in narrow strips, intermixed,\r\nin the south of England manner; and not far from it, a common cow\r\npasture and a common meadow. About Mere” (on the Somerset border of\r\nWiltshire) “I observed the same appearances. In the Valley of Amesbury\r\nmuch of the land remains, I understand, under similar circumstances,\r\nthough they do not so evidently appear in the arable lands, which\r\nby the aggregation of estates, or of farms, or by exchanges among\r\nlandlords and their tenants, lie mostly in well-sized pieces. But the\r\nafter-eatage,[104] whether of the stubbs or the meadows, is enjoyed\r\nin common. And the grass downs of the common field townships are in a\r\nstate of common pasture the year round; being stinted by the arable\r\nlands” (“Southern District,” p. 308, etc.).\r\n\r\n [103] _I.e._, the whole of the district he calls “the Western Chalk\r\n hills.”\r\n\r\n [104] “After-eatage.” This is Marshall’s variant of “average,”\r\n showing his theory of the etymology of the word, a theory which might\r\n have been suggested to him by the quaint phrase common in Enclosure\r\n Acts: “The averages whereof are eaten and enjoyed by the proprietors\r\n according to a recognised stint.”\r\n\r\nOne fact to be noticed is that Hampshire was earlier enclosed than\r\nWiltshire; which is in accordance with what one would have expected.\r\nEnclosure spread westwards into Hampshire from Surrey and Sussex.\r\n\r\nDavis I have previously quoted. “The greater part of this county\r\n(Wiltshire) was formerly, and at no very remote period, in the hands\r\nof great proprietors. Almost every manor had its resident lord, who\r\nheld part of the lands in demesne, and granted out the rest by copy\r\nor lease to under tenants, usually for three lives renewable. A state\r\nof commonage, and particularly of open common fields, was peculiarly\r\nfavourable to this tenure. Inclosures naturally tend to its extinction.\r\n\r\n“The North-West of Wiltshire being much better adapted to inclosures\r\nand to sub-division of property than the South, was inclosed first;\r\nwhile the South-East or Down district, has undergone few inclosures and\r\nstill fewer sub-divisions” (“Agriculture of Wiltshire,” p. 8).\r\n\r\nWe have previously seen that Cobbett, traversing that same South-East\r\ndistrict of Wiltshire, found in 1825 the common field or “tenantry”\r\nsystem completely superseded by that of great farms. Parliamentary\r\nenclosure only partly effected the change, which appears to have been\r\nso complete in the space of a single generation, 1793–1825. The violent\r\nfluctuations in the price of grain during the great war, the wholesale\r\nruin of farmers in 1815 and 1816, the abuse of the Poor Law peculiarly\r\nrampant in Wiltshire, by which the peasants who held such little\r\nholdings as we have observed in Fordington and Stratton and Grimstone,\r\nby lease or copy, were compelled to pay in their rates the wages of\r\nthe labourers employed by the great farmers who were superseding them,\r\nand the decay of home industries to which Cobbett bears witness, all\r\nthese were complementary parts of the social transition, each assisting\r\nall the others, and all together converting the tiller of the soil\r\nfrom the peasant with a medieval status, a responsible member of a\r\nself-governing village community, into a pauperised, half-starved\r\nlabourer.\r\n\r\nThough North-West Wiltshire was enclosed earlier than the South-East,\r\nBerkshire was enclosed later than Wiltshire as a whole. This\r\nis indicated by the scope and distribution of Enclosure Acts.\r\nParliamentary enclosure covers 26·0 per cent. of Berkshire, 24·1 per\r\ncent. of Wiltshire. Of the total 120,002 acres enclosed by Act in\r\nBerkshire, 42,631 acres was enclosed in the eighteenth century; 77,371\r\nacres in the nineteenth. In Wiltshire the proportions are reversed;\r\n126,060 acres were enclosed in the eighteenth century, 86,073 acres in\r\nthe nineteenth.\r\n\r\nThe non-Parliamentary enclosure in the nineteenth century was\r\npeculiarly active in Berkshire. William Pearce, the Board of\r\nAgriculture surveyor, computed that in 1794 the common fields and\r\ndowns occupied 220,000 acres; forests, wastes, and commons, 40,000;\r\nand the enclosed lands, including parks and woods, only 170,000 acres\r\n(“Agriculture of Berkshire,” p. 13). He further assures us that at\r\nleast half of the arable land was in common fields (p. 49). As rather\r\nless than 20 per cent. of the total area of the county was enclosed by\r\nActs at a later date, it would follow that about 30 per cent. of its\r\narea was enclosed without Acts after 1793; and from my own inquiries\r\nI can quite believe this conclusion is accurate. Enclosure under the\r\ngeneral Acts of 1836 and 1840 may have been specially extensive in\r\nBerkshire.\r\n\r\nDorset underwent enclosure at an earlier period. The percentage\r\nof Parliamentary enclosure is only 8·7, which is similar to that\r\nof Hampshire, 6.0; and there is no evidence of very extensive\r\nnon-Parliamentary enclosure in the nineteenth century. Stevenson\r\nin 1812 reported, “There are but few uninclosed fields remaining”\r\n(“Agriculture of Dorset,” p. 194); and the earlier reporter, Claridge,\r\nin 1794, said, “Very few parishes in this county have of late years\r\nbeen enclosed” (“Agriculture of Dorset,” p. 46). In the intervening\r\nperiod only fourteen Acts enclosing sixteen parishes were passed;\r\nDorset must therefore have been mainly enclosed before the time of\r\nthe American War; enclosure having no doubt spread eastwards from\r\nDevonshire, which was a very old enclosed county.\r\n\r\nCelia Fiennes adds little to our information, except that she says the\r\nVale of the White Horse, in Berkshire, “extends a vast way, a rich\r\njnclosed country” (p. 19), that there were “Good lands, meadows, woods\r\nand jnclosures” in the Isle of Purbeck, (p. 6), and that the country\r\nround “Stonidge,” like that round Newtontony, was “most champion\r\nand open, husbandry mostly corn and sheep” (p. 10). But there is a\r\nsignificant passage in John Norden, which shows that the characteristic\r\nWiltshire and Dorsetshire common-field management in 1600 prevailed\r\nover all four counties. “In Dorset, Wiltshire, Hamshire, Barkeshire,\r\nand other places champion, the farmers do much inrich their land indeed\r\nwith the sheepfold” (Book V., p. 232).\r\n\r\nLeland, however, is full of information. He came into Berkshire at\r\nWallingford, and rode thence to Abingdon and to Oxford. The first touch\r\nof description is “About this Sinodune beginneth the fruteful Vale\r\nof White Horse--this Vale is not plentifulle of woodde” (Vol. II.,\r\nfol. 14). This must be compared with Celia Fiennes’ description of\r\nthe same Vale, “a rich jnclosed country.” He next proceeded westwards\r\nalong the southern side of the Thames. “From this place” (Hinxey hill,\r\none mile from Oxford) the hilly ground was “meately woody for the\r\nspace of a mile, and thens 10 miles al by Chaumpain, and sum Corne,\r\nbut most pasture, to Farington.” He crossed the river and entered\r\nGloucestershire, but turning south entered Wiltshire, and found the\r\neight miles from Cirencester to Malmesbury “about a Mile on Furse then\r\nal by Champayne Ground, fruteful of corne and Grasse, but very little\r\nwood” (fol. 26). To Chippenham “al the Ground on that side of the Ryver\r\nwas Chaumpayne” (fol. 28) but towards Bradford “the countre beginneth\r\nto wax woddy” (fol. 30); and then he went west into Somerset, Devon and\r\nCornwall. He came back into Dorset from Axmouth, and in the extreme\r\nwestern part of Dorset gives no distinct description of the state of\r\nenclosure--it is “meately good ground” or “corne, pasture and wood;”\r\nbut from Melbury to Frome was “vj miles stille by Champaine ground\r\non an high rigge” (Vol. III., fol. 47). He came through Weymouth and\r\nPoole, and specified neither enclosure nor champain, till he reaches\r\nthe north-west corner of the county; but from Hoston to Cranbourne is\r\n“al by Champain Ground having nother Closure nor Wood,” and all the way\r\nto Salisbury continues “al by Champayne” (fol. 56). Again, “all the\r\nway from Salisbury to Winchester is Champayne,” but from Winchester to\r\nSouthampton, while there is “mouch drye feren Ground,” “the most part\r\nof the Ground betwixt is enclosid and reasonably woddyd” (fol. 74).\r\n\r\nTo Portsmouth enclosure predominated in the cultivated land. There\r\nis “much enclosid and Hethy Ground myxt with Ferne” (fol. 79), and\r\n“the Ground within the Isle of Portsmouth is partely enclosid” (fol.\r\n82). Turning north there was some “playn Ground” before entering Bere\r\nforest, afterwards “enclosid Ground” to Bishops Waltham, and for three\r\nmiles beyond; the remaining four to Winchester being “Champain” (fol.\r\n83).\r\n\r\nBut particularly in Dorset, instead of describing the land as enclosed,\r\nor “Champain,” he frequently uses such expressions as “meately well\r\nwoddid” or “good Corne and sum Grasse,” which it is difficult to\r\ninterpret in terms of enclosure. The choice of such expressions\r\nprobably implies (1) that there is not much actual enclosure by hedges,\r\nand (2) that there are no _extensive_ arable common fields. Such\r\ndescriptions would suit land passing directly from the condition of\r\nforest or moor into separate cultivation, but in which the cultivated\r\npatches were not as yet enclosed with hedges; or a district in which\r\nsmall arable common fields were surrounded by such later extensions of\r\ncultivation. But leaving Dorset in doubt, it is clear from Leland’s\r\nnotes that enclosure was well begun in the south of Hampshire, while\r\nthe country to the north was all open.\r\n\r\nIn the above journey Leland skirted the central chalk district; later\r\nhe passed directly through it, going from Oxford through Abingdon,\r\nLambourn, Marlborough and Devizes to Trowbridge. He passed the forests\r\nof Savernake and Blake, but all the cultivated land is described as\r\n“champayne” (Vol. VII., Part 2, fol. 63–7).\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we find that in the south of Hampshire, the cultivated land\r\nwas early enclosed, and also probably in the south and west of Dorset,\r\nthat enclosure gradually spread from the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury into the rest of the four counties, the movement attacking\r\nthe “champain” district on three sides, on the east from Surrey, on\r\nthe south from the early enclosed district between Winchester and\r\nSouthampton and Portsmouth, and in the west from Devon and Somerset;\r\nthe progress of enclosure appears to have been practically confined\r\nto Dorset and Hampshire in the seventeenth century; to have had the\r\nnorth-west of Wiltshire for its chief scene in the greater part of the\r\neighteenth century, and finally to have attacked south-east Wiltshire\r\nand Berkshire, the former in the first quarter, the latter throughout\r\nthe first half, of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER AND WORCESTER.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Gloucester, with the exception of the Forest of Dean and\r\nits neighbourhood in the west, has scattered over it parishes enclosed\r\nby Acts of Parliament; and the enclosure so effected amounted to nearly\r\na quarter (22·5 per cent.) of the whole area of the county. The rich\r\nland in the Severn Valley was the latest enclosed district. William\r\nMarshall tells us that in 1789 “perhaps half the vale is undivided\r\nproperty.” (“Rural Economy of Gloucestershire,” Vol. I., p. 16.) As\r\nenclosure by Act of Parliament, and doubtless also without Acts, had\r\nbeen proceeding vigorously since 1726, it is probable that at the\r\nearlier date nearly the whole was in “a state of commonage.” Of the\r\nCotswold Hills, Marshall says: “Thirty years ago (_i.e._, in 1759)\r\nthis district lay almost entirely in an open state, namely, in arable\r\ncommon fields, sheep-walk, and cow-down. At present it may be said to\r\nbe in a state of Inclosure, though some few townships yet remain open.”\r\n(_Ibid._, Vol. II., p. 9.)\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out that in Gloucestershire enclosure without\r\nActs was specially easy, in consequence of the custom of holding land.\r\nThe ancient custom of “copyhold by three lives renewable” had very\r\ngenerally been converted into “leasehold by three lives renewable,”\r\nthe difference being that the lord of the manor’s option of accepting\r\na new life became real instead of nominal. It was easy for a landlord\r\nwho wished to enclose to convert each such lease as it fell in to one\r\nfor a short period of years; and it was in this way, Marshall says, the\r\nenclosure of the Cotswold Hills was mainly effected.\r\n\r\nThe south-west of Gloucestershire, towards Somerset, to a considerable\r\nextent shared in the early enclosure of that county; though for\r\nSomerset we have also to say that while the western half was, like\r\nDevonshire, very early enclosed, the eastern half to a certain extent\r\nshared in the comparatively late enclosure Gloucestershire and the\r\nnorth-west of Wiltshire, as the map shows.\r\n\r\nWorcester similarly shows the transition between South Warwickshire,\r\nthe enclosure history of which has been dealt with, and the counties\r\non the Welsh border. Pomeroy reported in 1794 to the Board of\r\nAgriculture: “The lands are in general inclosed; there are, however,\r\nsome considerable tracts in open fields.” About 45,000 acres have since\r\nbeen enclosed by Acts for enclosing common fields _inter alia_; which\r\nis perhaps as large an area as the phrase “considerable tracts” is\r\nintended to describe. Just one-sixth of the total area of the county\r\nis covered by the whole series of such Acts, mainly in the eastern\r\nhalf of the county. Leland tells us “most part of all Somersetshire\r\nis yn hegge rowys enclosid” with elms, and from his other notes we\r\nfind that the north-west half of Worcestershire was enclosed by\r\nabout 1540, and the southern extremity of Gloucestershire about half\r\nenclosed by that date. We further find, from evidence quoted above,\r\nthat the rest of Worcestershire shared the enclosure experience of\r\nWarwick and Leicester, though probably at a somewhat earlier date,\r\nthat is, undergoing enclosure mainly in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, though in the end the process dragged on and was only\r\ncompleted after the Act of 1845 was passed. We find the Cotswold Hills\r\nenclosed mainly between 1750 and 1790, the Severn Valley undergoing\r\nenclosure during this period, but only about half enclosed at the\r\nend of it, and enclosure continuing steadily to the very end of the\r\nnineteenth century, with Elmstone Hardwicke still remaining uninclosed,\r\nwaiting for leases for lives to expire.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CELTIC FRINGE.\r\n\r\nThe part of the country which remains to be considered is that in\r\nwhich the problem is complicated by the question whether the primitive\r\nvillage community was of an English or Celtic type. The remaining\r\ncounties may be grouped under the titles West Wales, Strathclyde and\r\nthe Welsh border.\r\n\r\nWe have previously seen that fluidity in the tenure of the soil,\r\nwhich is one characteristic of the Celtic run-rig as compared with the\r\nAnglo-Saxon common field system, favours the separation of properties\r\nand holdings at the time when co-aration ceases to be practised; and,\r\nin consequence, to early enclosure without any special efforts of the\r\ntype of an Act of Parliament. But we have also seen that a prevailingly\r\npastoral country tends to have its arable lands more easily and earlier\r\nenclosed than a prevailingly arable country. There are therefore two\r\nexplanations available for the early enclosure of the whole western\r\nhalf of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, the broad facts with regard to the history of enclosure\r\nmust be made clear.\r\n\r\nThere are no Acts specifically for enclosing common arable fields\r\nin Wales, nor any in which the phraseology of the preamble clearly\r\nindicates the existence in Wales of land possessing all three of the\r\nessential characteristics of English common field: (1) intermixed\r\nownership or occupation, (2) absence of adequate hedges or other\r\nobstacles to the passage of men and animals from one holding to\r\nanother, (3) common rights exercisable over the tilled land.\r\n\r\nBut there were[105] in Wales open tilled fields in which properties\r\nand holdings were intermixed--that is, land possessing the first two\r\ncharacteristics. Several Welsh Acts for enclosing commonable waste also\r\nenclose “intermixed lands,” and one (1843, c. 14) is for the enclosure\r\nin Llandudno and three neighbouring villages, of “Divers Commons,\r\ncommonable lands and waste grounds, Heaths, open and Common and other\r\nFields and Waste lands, and other Common lands and Waste grounds, which\r\nlie intermixed in small parcels, and are inconveniently situated for\r\nthe use and enjoyment of the several proprietors.”\r\n\r\n [105] Many townships in North Wales still contain “quilleted” areas,\r\n _i.e._, enclosed fields containing unenclosed strips of land belonging\r\n to a different owner or owners from that of the rest of the field.\r\n Such scattered “quillets” are, as in Berkshire, frequently glebe land.\r\n\r\nThe following are the reports on the subject by the Board of\r\nAgriculture reporters in 1793 and 1794:--\r\n\r\n“Open or Common Fields are rarely met with in South Wales. It is\r\na mode of cultivation only practised in a few instances, where\r\necclesiastical and private property are blended.” (John Fox,\r\n“Agriculture of Glamorgan,” p. 41.)\r\n\r\n“The only tract like a common field is an extent of very productive\r\nbarley land, reaching on the coast from Aberavon to Llanrhysted. This\r\nquarter is much intermixed, and chiefly in small holdings.” (Thomas\r\nLloyd, “Agriculture of Cardigan,” p. 29.)\r\n\r\n_Carmarthen._ “I do not know of any considerable extent of open common\r\nfield in the county.” (Charles Hassell, “Agriculture of Carmarthen,” p.\r\n21.)\r\n\r\n_Pembroke._ “In the neighbourhood of St. David’s considerable tracts\r\nof open field lands are still remaining which is chiefly owing to the\r\npossessions of the church being intermixed with private property.”\r\n(Charles Hassell, “Agriculture of Pembroke,” p. 20.)\r\n\r\n_Radnor._ “Here are no Common Fields.” (John Clark, “Agriculture of\r\nRadnor,” p. 21.)\r\n\r\n_Flint._ “There are no common fields, or fields in run-rig, in this\r\ncounty, except between Flint and St. Asaph, and it is in intention to\r\ndivide and inclose them.” (George Kay, “Agriculture of Flint,” p. 4.)\r\n\r\n_Cærnarvon._ “Run-rig. There are no lands of this description that I\r\ncould hear of, but there is a good deal of mixed property that might be\r\nexchanged.” (George Kay, “Agriculture of Cærnarvon.”)\r\n\r\nThere was in existence a mere remnant of open intermixed, arable\r\nland, which one reporter evidently thinks ought to be described as\r\nrun-rig, and not as common field. Though in many respects agricultural\r\nmethods were of the most primitive type, yet enclosure was practically\r\ncomplete; in two out of the four counties in which open fields are\r\nstated to be surviving, the explanation of such an exceptional\r\ncircumstance is given in the intermixture of church and lay property.\r\nThis well corroborates the _a priori_ argument that the Celtic type of\r\nvillage community easily yields to enclosure; and that a predominance\r\nof pasture over arable also facilitates early enclosure of what arable\r\nthere is. Mr. A. N. Palmer shows that the varying operation of the\r\ncustom of gavelkind (equal inheritance by all sons) is also closely\r\nconnected with the recent phenomena of the distribution of holdings.\r\nEverywhere the land which was ancient open arable fields is now,\r\nand has been for an unknown period dating at least as far back as\r\n1620, divided by hedges into small enclosures, as in Devonshire; but\r\nin some districts these contain, or are known to have contained in\r\ncomparatively recent times, intermixed quillets of other ownership.\r\nIn these districts Mr. Palmer supposes the ancient “gafæl” or “gwely”\r\n(which may be roughly defined as a patriarchal family holding), was\r\nat the time when co-aration ceased, very much sub-divided. In other\r\ndistricts where the “gafæl” or “gwely” was little sub-divided, so\r\nthat each occupier could support his own plough team, when co-aration\r\nceased, holdings became entirely separated from one another. (“History\r\nof Ancient Tenures of Land in North Wales,” pp. 35–37.)\r\n\r\nWe have now to fix with what accuracy we may the time of the enclosure\r\nof the western counties, and then to search for evidence in those\r\ncounties of variations from the typical English village community.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVON, CORNWALL AND WEST SOMERSET.\r\n\r\nThese counties were very early enclosed. There is so much earlier\r\nevidence that it seems superfluous to quote Celia Fiennes, but there\r\nare some suggestive touches in her description.\r\n\r\n“I entered into Devonshire 5 miles off from Wellington, just on a high\r\nridge of hills which discovers a vast prospect on Each side full of\r\nInclosures and lesser hills which is the description of most part of\r\nthe West. You could see large tracts of grounds full of Enclosures,\r\ngood grass and corn beset with quicksetts and hedgerows” (p. 206). In\r\nvery similar words she describes the views on the roads from Exeter to\r\nChudleigh, and from Chudleigh to Ashburton.\r\n\r\n“Devonshire is Much like Somersetshire, fruitfull countrys for corn,\r\ngraseing, much for inclosures that makes the wayes very narrow, so as\r\nin some places a coach and waggons cannot pass. They are forced to\r\ncarry their corn and carriagis on horses backes with frames of woods\r\nlike pannyers on either side of the horse, so load it high and tye it\r\nwith cords. This they do altogether the further westward they goe, for\r\nthe wayes grow narrower and narrower up to the land’s end” (p. 9). As\r\nCelia Fiennes rode into the far west of Cornwall, hers is the evidence\r\nof an eye-witness. She points to the explanation of the extreme\r\nnarrowness for which Devonshire lanes are still noted--enclosure took\r\nplace before the introduction of carts.\r\n\r\nDevonshire is spoken of in the previously quoted passage in the\r\n“Discourse of the Commonweal,” about 1550, as, with Essex and Kent,\r\none of the most enclosed counties. Leland, about the year 1537 passed\r\nthrough North Devon into Cornwall, as far as Wadebridge and Bodmin,\r\nand back through South Devon. His statement that Somerset was much\r\nenclosed with hedgerows of elms, has already been quoted. In Devon and\r\nCornwall he found no “champaine,” but frequently “meately good corne\r\nand grasse;” on the other hand, he frequently found enclosure.\r\n\r\nAfter recording his arrival at Dunster, he says: “From Combane to the\r\nSterte most part of the Shore is Hilly Ground, and nere the Shore is\r\nno Store of wood; that that is ys al in Hegge rowes of Enclosures”\r\n(Vol. II., fol. 63). There was enclosed ground between Bideford and\r\nTorrington (fol. 68); from Torrington to Launceston was either “hilly\r\nand much enclosid,” or “hilly and much morisch” (fol. 69), and also\r\nfrom Launceston to Boscastle (fol. 72).\r\n\r\nEntering South Devon, he remarks simply on the fertility of the soil,\r\nbut remarks: “The hole Ground bytwixt Torrebay and Exmouth booth\r\nsumwhat to the shore and especially inward is wel inclosed” (Vol. III.,\r\nfol. 31).\r\n\r\nIn the year of Leland’s visit, probably either 1537 or 1538, the\r\ncultivated lands of Devon and Cornwall and Somerset were largely, but\r\nnot entirely, enclosed. In East Somerset alone did Leland find any land\r\nwhich he could describe as “champaine”; we may infer therefore that\r\nthough no doubt there was a good deal of open field arable, probably\r\nstill cultivated by co-aration, it existed in the form of comparatively\r\nsmall areas round villages and hamlets; nowhere, in Leland’s route,\r\nextending over a considerable tract of country.\r\n\r\nCarew, in his book on Cornwall, dated 1600, gives an account of the\r\nenclosure of that county. Of the manorial tenants, he says: “They fal\r\neverywhere from Commons to Inclosure and partake not of some Eastern\r\nTenants envious dispositions, who will sooner prejudice their owne\r\npresent thrift, by continuing this _mingle mangle_, than advance the\r\nLordes expectant benefit, after their terme expired” (p. 30).\r\n\r\nThis pregnant passage tells us--\r\n\r\n(1) That the Enclosure of tilled land in Cornwall had been proceeding\r\nrapidly up to 1600 and was then nearly complete;\r\n\r\n(2) That previous to enclosure the system of cultivation, whether it\r\nmost resembled the English common field system or Scotch run-rig, had\r\nfor one of its features the intermixture of holdings; and for another\r\nsome elements of collective ownership or management entitling it to the\r\nname “Commons”;\r\n\r\n(3) That Carew’s conception of a manorial tenant is not that of a\r\nfreeholder, nor of a copyholder, but that of a leaseholder, whose term\r\nexpires, the lord of the manor reaping the fruit, on the expiration of\r\nthe lease, of any improvements the tenant may have made. He further\r\non explains that the system of leases for three lives was practically\r\nuniversal in Cornwall, not in the modern form in which any three lives\r\nmay be named in the lease, but depending for its continuance on the\r\nlives of the lessee, his widow and his son. It is obvious that this\r\ncondition of land tenure would be more favourable to early enclosure\r\nthan copyhold.\r\n\r\nAnother passage in Carew bears witness to the practical completion\r\nof enclosure. Writing of the legal conditions under which the miners\r\npursued their enterprise, he says: “Their workes, both streame and\r\nLoad, lie either in severall or in waistrell,” that is, either in\r\nenclosed land under separate exclusive ownership and occupation, or in\r\nwaste. One cannot draw the inference that there was absolutely no open\r\nfield land; but merely that its extent was in comparison so small as\r\nto appear negligible in this connection to Carew.\r\n\r\nThough it is not improbable that the enclosure of Cornwall took place\r\nat an earlier stage of agricultural evolution than that of Devonshire,\r\nit is somewhat improbable that it took place at an earlier date. It\r\nis a reasonable inference from the evidence that by the end of the\r\nsixteenth century the enclosure of Devon and Cornwall was practically\r\ncomplete. When it began is a different question.\r\n\r\nThe charter of John by which all Devonshire except Dartmoor and Exmoor\r\nwas deforested, expressly forbids the making of hedges on those two\r\nforests. This is itself some evidence that enclosure of some sort,\r\nprobably enclosure of waste, for the purpose of cultivation, was going\r\non actively in the beginning of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nAttention must here be drawn to an ancient custom in Devon and Cornwall\r\nsurviving to the end of the eighteenth century. William Marshall gives\r\nan account of it, and shows its probable importance in determining the\r\ncharacter of enclosure and of all the attendant circumstances in Devon\r\nand Cornwall.\r\n\r\n“_West Devonshire._ This district has no traces of common fields. The\r\ncultivated lands are all enclosed, mostly in well sized enclosures;\r\ngenerally large in proportion to the sizes of farms. They have every\r\nappearance of having been formed from a state of common pasture; in\r\nwhich state, some considerable part of the District still remains;\r\nand what is observable, the better parts of these open commons have\r\nevidently been heretofore in a state of aration; lying in obvious\r\nridges and furrows; with generally the remains of hedgebanks,\r\ncorresponding with the ridges, and with faint traces of buildings.\r\n\r\n“From these circumstances it is understood by some men of observation,\r\nthat these lands have formerly been in a state of permanent inclosure,\r\nand have been thrown up again, to a state of commonage, through a\r\ndecrease in the population of the country.\r\n\r\n“But from observations made in different parts of Devonshire, these\r\nappearances, which are common, perhaps, to every part of the county,\r\nwould rather seem to have arisen out of a custom, peculiar perhaps to\r\nthis part of the island, and which still remains in use, of lords of\r\nmanors having the privileges of letting portions of the common lands,\r\nlying within their respective precincts, to tenants, for the purpose of\r\ntaking one or more crops of corn, and then suffering the land to revert\r\nto a state of grass and commonage.\r\n\r\n“In the infancy of society, and while the country remained in the\r\nforest state, this was a most rational and eligible way of proceeding.\r\nThe rough sides of the dells and dingles with which it abounds were\r\nmost fit for the production of wood; the flatter, better parts of\r\nthe surface of the country were required for corn and pasturage; and\r\nhow could a more ready way of procuring both have been fallen upon\r\nthan that of giving due portions of it to the industrious part of the\r\ninhabitants, to clear away the wood and adjust the surface, and after\r\nhaving reaped a few crops of corn to pay the expense of cultivation,\r\nto throw it up to grass, before it had become too much exhausted to\r\nprevent its becoming, in a few years, profitable sward? In this manner\r\nthe county would be supplied progressively as population increased,\r\nwith corn and pasturage, and the forests be converted, by degrees, into\r\ncommon pasture.\r\n\r\n“The wild or unreclaimed lands being at length gone over in this way,\r\nsome other source of arable crops would be requisite. Indeed, before\r\nthis could take place, the pasture grounds would be disproportionate to\r\nthe corn lands; and out of these circumstances, it is highly probable,\r\narose the present Inclosures.” (“Rural Economy of the West of England,”\r\n1795, p. 31.)\r\n\r\nThe same custom was observed in Cornwall by G. B. Morgan, the Board of\r\nAgriculture Reporter. (“Agriculture of Cornwall,” p. 46.)\r\n\r\nI believe this custom is the explanation of the huge size of the hedges\r\nwhich is frequently observable in Devonshire. A mound about eight feet\r\nhigh, and six or seven feet through, surmounted by a quickset hedge, is\r\nnot uncommon. When a plot of land which had once been enclosed from the\r\nwaste for cultivation, and then thrown into common pasture, with its\r\nhedges cast down, had recovered its fertility, it would naturally again\r\nbe selected for enclosure and cultivation; the cast down rough stone\r\nwall, now overgrown with vegetation, would be made the foundation for a\r\nnew hedge; and the same process might be repeated several times before\r\nfinal enclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAUNTON GREAT FIELD.\r\n\r\nI have said above that it is reasonable to infer from the evidence that\r\nenclosure was practically complete in Devon and Cornwall by the end\r\nof the sixteenth century. It is not, however, absolutely complete to\r\nthe present day; for Braunton Great Field remains uninclosed. Braunton\r\nis a little town of about two thousand inhabitants, situated between\r\nIlfracombe and Barnstaple, near the sea coast. Braunton Field is said\r\nto have “as many acres as there are days in the year,” each nominal\r\nacre being a strip of land of about an acre in area. Properties and\r\nholdings are very much intermixed, many of the holdings are very\r\nsmall and cultivated by their owners. Each “acre” is separated from\r\nthe rest on each side by a balk of untilled land, growing grass,\r\nyarrow, hawkweed, etc., just a foot wide. They are locally known as\r\n“launchers,” which one associates with the Dorset name “lawns” for the\r\nstrips of ploughed land, and the name “landshare,” in the Stratton\r\nCourt rolls for the unploughed balks.\r\n\r\nThere is also always a path, or a broader balk, called an “edge,”\r\nseparating the different sets of acres, which elsewhere would be called\r\n“Shots” or “Furlongs,” from one another.\r\n\r\nNo common rights exist at present, or have existed in living memory\r\nover either the unploughed balks, or the tillage lands themselves.\r\nBut old villagers remember that long ago one half of the field was\r\nkept for wheat, and the other half for potatoes, clover, etc., in\r\nother words, that there use to be a common rule for the cultivation\r\nof the field and this common rule was similar to that prevailing in\r\nthe Gloucestershire every year lands. At present each occupant\r\ncultivates his strips just as he pleases. It is of course possible that\r\nthis obsolete common rule is itself a survival from an older one, and\r\nthat originally this field was cultivated on the two-field system so\r\nprevalent in Lincolnshire; half under wheat, half fallow, the fallow\r\nbeing commonable all the year, and the wheat after harvest. But on the\r\nother hand, the custom of getting a crop every year may have been the\r\noriginal one, and Braunton Great Field may be ancient “Every Year land”\r\nor “Infield.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Part of Braunton Great Field.\r\n\r\n  Scale 1/3000\r\n\r\n  The dotted lines represent bulks separating adjacent strips in the\r\n  open field; the continuous lines represent hedges. It is easy to see\r\n  how the enclosures on the edge of the field were made out of two or\r\n  three strips thrown together.]\r\n\r\nBraunton Field is noteworthy in that it shows that however the\r\nprimitive village community of West Wales may have differed from that\r\nof Wessex, it must have had certain characteristics in common with\r\nit, by which open arable fields of intermixed occupation were created\r\nin the neighbourhood of villages. Braunton cannot have been from the\r\nbeginning an isolated example. The process of enclosure by the method\r\nMarshall describes went on around and outside these ancient tilled open\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting fact is revealed by the study of the twenty-five\r\ninch Ordnance map for Braunton. Braunton Field has been much reduced\r\nin area; one can easily see that the adjoining lands were once part\r\nof the open field, for the hedges in the lands are so placed as to\r\nform a continuation of the spider-web lines of the “launchers” within\r\nthe field. The average size of the enclosed fields outside the Great\r\nField is indeed a little greater than of the separate lands within it,\r\nbut there is an imperceptible gradation, beginning with the smallest\r\n“lands” in the Great Field which are nearest the village, on through\r\nthose more remote, the nearer enclosed fields, and then the more remote\r\nof them. Enclosure has been effected by simply enclosing the strips\r\nof arable land in the open field as they are. The fact that no common\r\nrights existed over the Field, supposing this always to have been the\r\ncase, would have made such enclosure almost a matter of indifference\r\nto the other occupiers; and the motive, no doubt, would be the desire\r\nto lay the strip down in pasture. The whole field is known to the\r\nvillagers as “the tillage land.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WELSH BORDER.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure history of the counties along the Welsh border is\r\nsomewhat similar to that of Devonshire. It took place early, partly\r\nin consequence of the predominance of pasture over arable, and partly\r\nunder the influence of a custom of temporarily enclosing the waste and\r\ncommon pasture, similar to that in Devon and Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe percentages of area of these counties enclosed by Acts for\r\nenclosure of common field arable are respectively:\r\n\r\n                    Per cent.\r\n\r\n  Cheshire              0·5\r\n  Hereford              3·6\r\n  Monmouth              0·4\r\n  Shropshire            0·3\r\n  Staffordshire         2·8\r\n\r\nThe Board of Agriculture reporter’s statements on the common fields\r\nsurviving in 1793 are that in Cheshire there was not so much as 1,000\r\nacres (Wedge, “Agriculture of Cheshire,” p. 9); in Staffordshire\r\nlittle more than 1,000 acres (Pitt, “Agriculture of Staffordshire,”\r\np. 85); that Shropshire “does not contain much common field land” (J.\r\nBishton, “Agriculture of Shropshire,” p. 8); but that in Hereford some\r\nof the best lands of the county are common fields (Clark, “Agriculture\r\nof Hereford,” p. 69). Of Hereford, William Marshall gives a fuller\r\naccount. “Herefordshire is an inclosed county. Some few remnants of\r\ncommon fields are seen in what is called the upper part of the county;\r\nbut in general it appears to have been inclosed from the forest state;\r\ncrooked fences and winding narrow lanes” (p. 224).\r\n\r\nCelia Fiennes found from Nantwich to Chester “much Enclosures” (p.\r\n147), but from Salford to Northwich, “I went a very pleasant roade,\r\nmuch in the downs, mostly campion ground, some few Enclosures”;\r\nHerefordshire, “a country of Gardens and Orchards, with apple and pear\r\ntrees thick in the hedgerows” (p. 33); Staffordshire, “well wooded\r\nand full of Enclosures, Good Rich Ground, extremely differing from\r\nDerbyshire” (p. 89). This was her first impression, confirmed later.\r\n“Harteshill is so high that from the top of it you see near 20 miles\r\nround, and shows all the county which in this part of Staffordshire\r\nis full of woods and jnclosures and good lands, except the Knackwood”\r\n(p. 137). From “Nedwoodforest” ... “you have a fine prospect of\r\nthe country, enclosed good lands” (p. 139). Also beyond Stafford\r\ntowards Cheshire was mostly enclosures (p. 144), and from Stafford to\r\nWolverhampton the journey was through lanes (p. 194).\r\n\r\nWalter Blyth includes Staffordshire and Shropshire as part of “the\r\nWoodlands, who before Enclosure, were wont to be relieved by the\r\nFieldon, with corn of all sorts. And now grown as gallant Corne\r\ncountries as be in England” (“The English Improver,” 1649, p. 40).\r\n\r\nEvidence of early enclosure is supplied by Leland. About White Castle,\r\nwhich I take to be Bishop’s Castle, in south-west Shropshire, “the\r\nCountrys is Champion” (Vol. IV. fol. 176 b), but from Hereford to\r\nLeominster was enclosed ground (176 b and 177 a), thence towards Ludlow\r\n“by goodly corne Ground, part by enclosed” (178 b), Bridgenorth to\r\nKidderminster “most by enclosed Ground” (182 b), to Bewdly was by “a\r\nfayre downe,” but all the way thence to Milton (4 miles), Hertlebury\r\n(2 miles), Salopbrook (5 miles), Worcester (3 miles), Wick (6 miles)\r\nand Bromsgrove (4 miles), each stage is said to be by enclosed ground\r\n(fols. 183 b–186 a).\r\n\r\nAs for Monmouthshire, “The soyle of al Venteland” (Gwent, the country\r\nbetween the Wye and Usk) “is of dark reddish Yerth ful of slaty stones,\r\nand other greater of the same colour. The country is also sumwhat\r\nmountaynous and well replenished with Woodes, also fertile of Corne;\r\nbut men there study more to Pastures, the which be wel inclosed” (Vol.\r\nV., fol. 5), and “Erchenfeld is full of Enclosures very (fruteful) of\r\nCorne and Wood” (fol. 9). Round Shrewsbury there is “ground plentiful\r\nof Corne, wood and pasture” (Vol. V., fol. 80), at Whitchurch “meately\r\nfruteful sandy ground” (fol. 81), and sandy ground on to Northwich\r\n(_ibid._).\r\n\r\nNowhere else in these counties is either “enclosure” or “champaine”\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\nThe evidence as to the existence of a custom of temporary enclosure\r\nof the waste, is supplied by Robert Plot’s book on “Staffordshire,”\r\npublished in 1686: “For the heathy land of this County, it is seldom\r\nenclosed; but when they intend it for tillage, which is never for above\r\nfive years neither, and then it is throwne open to the Commons again”\r\n(p. 343). “Their gouty, moorisch, peaty, cold black land, they husbande\r\nalso much after the same manner as they doe the heathy lands in the\r\nMoore Lands” (p. 345).\r\n\r\nAnother passage brings into juxtaposition the more recent enclosures\r\nfrom forest or moor for the sake of tillage, and the ancient arable\r\ncommon fields. “Others again have placed the origin of mildewing in\r\nmaking small inclosures, corn not being so lyable to this evil in the\r\ncommon open fields” (p. 351).\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to suppose that the custom found in Staffordshire and\r\nin Devon and Cornwall also prevailed in other counties, particularly in\r\nthose along the Welsh border. It is some confirmation that Eden about\r\na hundred years later found a similar custom still surviving in Sutton\r\nColdfield, in Warwickshire, but near the Staffordshire boundary.\r\n\r\n“The poor here, besides the right of commonage, have this peculiar\r\nprivilege, that every house-keeper may take in one acre of common, and\r\nplough it four years: and the fifth year he must sow it with clover and\r\nlay it to the common again; after which he may take another acre, and\r\nwork it in the like manner. By this method, about 400 acres of common\r\nare kept constantly in tillage” (“State of the Poor,” Vol. III., p.\r\n749, written probably in 1795).\r\n\r\nThe enclosure history of these five counties may be summed up in the\r\nstatement that it probably proceeded very similarly to enclosure in\r\nDevonshire, but at a somewhat later date; and that enclosure was later\r\ntowards the north. Monmouth, we see, was “full of enclosures” before\r\n1540; Shropshire “partly enclosed” with some “champion”; but though\r\nLeland passed through Cheshire, he does not mention enclosures, and\r\nCelia Fiennes found the North of Cheshire mostly open as late as\r\nabout 1697. In Hereford and Staffordshire there was a large proportion\r\nof ancient arable land, and complete enclosure was consequently\r\nlonger delayed, leaving an appreciable area to be enclosed by Acts of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRATHCLYDE.\r\n\r\nLancashire had no common field enclosed by Act of Parliament. It is\r\npossible that its partial autonomy as a Palatine County may account for\r\nthis; but it must be noticed that the Acts of enclosure for Lancashire\r\nfor enclosing commonable waste, are numerous right through the period\r\nof Enclosure Acts. Nor, though Lancashire was an early enclosed county,\r\ncan we explain the absence of Enclosure Acts by the assumption that\r\nthe enclosure of tilled land was completed by the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, for some common field persisted to the end of that\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nJohn Holt, the Board of Agriculture reporter, tells us: “There are but\r\nfew open, or common fields, at this time remaining; the inconvenience\r\nattending which, while they were in that state, have caused great\r\nexertions to accomplish a division, in order that every individual\r\nmight cultivate his own lands, according to his own method; and that\r\nthe lots of a few acres, in many places divided into small portions,\r\nand again separated at different distances, might be brought together\r\ninto one point” (“Agriculture of Lancashire,” p. 49). It would appear\r\nfrom this that the open fields of Lancashire, like Braunton Great\r\nField, though unenclosed, and intermixed, and subject to some common\r\nrule for cultivation, were not subject to common rights. Any owner,\r\ntherefore, who by exchanges or by buying and selling, could get his\r\nlands together in a convenient plot, might enclose without trespassing\r\non his neighbours’ rights.\r\n\r\nFrom Holt’s statement we find that enclosure was nearly, but not\r\nquite, complete by 1793. It was certainly far advanced a hundred years\r\nearlier. Celia Fiennes rode from Prescot to Wigan, “seven long miles\r\nmostly through lanes” (p. 153); from Gascoyne to Lancaster, “mostly\r\nall along lanes being an enclosed country” (p. 157). From Blackstone\r\nEdge the view was of “a fruitfull valley full of jnclosures” (p. 186).\r\nFrom Rochdale to Manchester, “the grounds were all enclosed with\r\nquicksetts” (p. 187).\r\n\r\nSimilarly Leland: “Manchester to Morle I passid by enclosid Grounde\r\npartely pasturable, partely fruteful of corn” (Vol. V., fol. 83). “The\r\nGround bytwixt Morle and Preston enclosid for Pasture and Cornes....\r\nLikewyse is the soile bytwixt Preston and Garstan; but alway the moste\r\nparte of Enclosures be for Pasturages” (fol. 84).\r\n\r\nCumberland and Westmoreland were later enclosed than Lancashire; and\r\nsome few remnants of open arable field were dealt with by Acts. At\r\nBolton, in Westmoreland, “certain open or common fields called Broad\r\nIng Bartle and Star Ing” of 22 acres, at Soulby 90 acres of open field,\r\nand at Barton 130 acres, were enclosed by Acts mainly passed for the\r\nsake of enclosing waste; and at Kirkby, in Kendal, “a common open\r\nfield” of 105 acres was enclosed. There were five Acts in Cumberland\r\nenclosing open fields; but only two say precisely how much. At\r\nTorpenton, 20 acres of field and 700 acres of waste was enclosed; at\r\nGreystoke, 240 acres of field and 3260 acres of waste.\r\n\r\nBut the enclosure of open-field arable was proceeding very steadily\r\nthrough the eighteenth century; and a clear account of the process is\r\nfurnished us by two keen observers.\r\n\r\nEden gives an account of the condition of the arable land in seven\r\nCumberland parishes, written either in December, 1794, or January, 1795.\r\n\r\n“_Gilcrux._ About 400 acres of common field have been enclosed within\r\nthe last fifty years” (“State of the Poor,” Vol. II., p. 76).\r\n\r\n“_Hesket._ No more than 200 acres have been enclosed within the last\r\nfifty years. A large part appears to have had its hedges planted a\r\nlittle before that period” (_Ibid._, p. 81).\r\n\r\n“_Ainstable._ Area 5,120 acres of which 3,480 are common.[106] About\r\n400 acres have been enclosed in the common fields within the last fifty\r\nyears.... The average rent of land is about 18_s._ per acre; but it\r\nis observable that here and in most parts of Cumberland, an extensive\r\ncommon right[107] is attached to most arable land” (p. 46).\r\n\r\n [106] _I.e._, common pasture or waste.\r\n\r\n [107] _I.e._, over the neighbouring common pasture.\r\n\r\n“_Croglin._ The average rent of open fields is 9_s._ 6_d._ the acre,\r\nof inclosures, 15_s._ or 16_s._ About 100 acres of common-field land\r\nhave been enclosed within the last fifty years; but a great part of the\r\narable land still remains in narrow, crooked _dales_, or _ranes_, as\r\nthey are called” (p. 67).\r\n\r\n“_Castle Carrock._ The greatest part of this parish remains in _dales_,\r\nor _doles_ as they are called; which are strips of cultivated land\r\nbelonging to different proprietors, separated from each other by ridges\r\nof grass land; about 100 acres may have been enclosed in the last fifty\r\nyears” (p. 65).\r\n\r\n“_Cumrew._ The land is cultivated in the old Cumberland manner; the\r\ngrass ridges in the fields are from twenty to thirty feet wide; and\r\nsome of them are 1000 feet in length. Grazing cattle often injure the\r\ncrops” (p. 68).\r\n\r\n“_Warwick._ Almost the whole of the cultivated land (1126 acres) has\r\nbeen enclosed within the last fifty years. It formerly, although\r\ndivided, lay in long strips, or narrow _dales_, separated from each\r\nother by _ranes_, or narrow ridges of land, which are left unploughed.\r\nIn this manner a great deal, and perhaps the whole, of the cultivated\r\nlands in Cumberland, was anciently disposed” (p. 92).\r\n\r\nThe other observer is the poet Wordsworth. In his book on the scenery\r\nof the lake district, he quotes from West’s “Antiquities of Furness”\r\nto show that in the troubled times between the union of the Crowns of\r\nEngland and Scotland, holdings were let to groups of four tenants, each\r\ngroup dividing its tenement into four equal parts. “These divisions\r\nwere not properly distinguished; the land remained mixed; each tenant\r\nhad a share through all the arable and meadow land, and common of\r\npasture over all the wastes.... The land being mixed and the several\r\ntenants united in equipping the plough, the absence of the fourth man”\r\n(who was called out for military service) “was no prejudice to the\r\ncultivation of his land, which was committed to the care of three.”\r\nIn High Furness, “The Abbots of Furness enfranchised these pastoral\r\nvassals, and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses, for\r\nwhich they paid encroachment rent.”\r\n\r\nWordsworth then proceeds with the tale of enclosure: “The enclosures,\r\nformed by the tenantry, are for a long time confined to the homesteads,\r\nand the arable and meadow land of the fields is possessed in common\r\nfields; the several portions being marked out by stones, bushes, or\r\ntrees; while portions, where the custom has survived, to this day are\r\ncalled _dales_, from the word deylen, to distribute; but while the\r\nvalley was thus lying open, enclosures seem to have taken place upon\r\nthe sides of the mountains; because the land there was not intermixed,\r\nand was of little comparative value; and therefore small opposition\r\nwould be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations\r\nit was contiguous. Hence the singular appearance which the sides of\r\nmany of these mountains exhibit, intersected, as they are, almost\r\nto the summit with stone walls.... There” (in the meadows and lower\r\ngrounds), “where the increasing value of land, and the inconvenience\r\nsuffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field, had induced\r\neach inhabitant to enclose his own, they were compelled to make fences\r\nof alders, willows, and other trees ... but these last partitions do\r\nnot seem to have been general till long past the pacification of the\r\nBorders, by the union of the two crowns” (Fourth Edition, p. 23).\r\n\r\nThe date of the enclosure of the intermixed arable and meadow land is\r\nthus fixed within certain broad limits. It did not begin till “long\r\npast the pacification of the Borders, by the union of the two crowns.”\r\nIt took some time to effect the pacification of the Borders, even after\r\nthe accession of James I. made it possible; “long past” that event is\r\na vague date, but may very well bring us at least as late as the date\r\nwhen the enclosure of the common fields of Durham is supposed to have\r\nbegun, “soon after the Restoration.” It is certain, further, from\r\nEden’s information, that enclosure was going on steadily right through\r\nthe second half of the eighteenth century, but by no means complete in\r\n1795. The high prices of the war period would have greatly stimulated\r\nthe movement, for it is obvious that if rents were thereby doubled both\r\nfor open and enclosed land, the gross profit of enclosing would also\r\nbe doubled; the net gain probably more than doubled. When Wordsworth\r\nwrote, the open fields were apparently still fairly numerous, but they\r\nhad become a mere survival.\r\n\r\nThe date of the enclosure of this district is, however, the least\r\ninteresting of the inferences to be drawn.\r\n\r\nWe find that up to the union of the Crowns, cultivation was carried\r\non by a system very closely resembling the “run-rig” of the Hebrides.\r\nGroups of four tenants combined together, and yoked their horses to\r\na common plough, and equally divided the holding between them, each\r\ntenant having his equal share in all parts of the holding. We next\r\nfind that on the decay of this co-aration, for a long period, varying\r\nin duration in different parishes, holdings remained intermixed, but\r\nit seems clear that as in the one surviving Devonshire open field,\r\nand probably as in Lancashire, common rights were not exercised over\r\nthe arable fields; though it might happen that besides the “ranes,”\r\nthe grassy balks between the strips of arable land, there might be\r\nconsiderable stretches of grass amidst the arable field which was used\r\nfor a common pasture. Lastly, we find that open, intermixed arable land\r\nand meadows, having this history, passes into a state of enclosure\r\nwhere increase of population, agricultural progress, and the increasing\r\nvalue of land make enclosure sufficiently profitable, by a gradual,\r\npiecemeal process, without the need for Act of Parliament, or reference\r\nto a Commission, or any combined resolution on the part of the lord and\r\ntenants of a manor.\r\n\r\nIt is because the process was late in Cumberland and Westmoreland and\r\nbecause it happened to interest three authors, West, Wordsworth, and\r\nEden, who were not agriculturists, that the record of it for these two\r\ncounties is available. All the indications suggest that Northumberland\r\nand Durham underwent a similar evolution; and all the preceding\r\ninformation with regard to the enclosure of Wales and much of the\r\nland immediately on the Welsh border, and of West Somerset, Devon and\r\nCornwall, harmonises with the hypothesis that in those districts also\r\nthe process was fundamentally the same, though with local differences,\r\ndue to a very much earlier pacification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE RESULTS OF ENCLOSURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scenery of England and Wales has been transformed by the enclosure\r\nof its lands, but the extent and results of the transformation vary.\r\nHere you have the landscape cut into little fields with great hedges,\r\nlooking from an elevated point of view like a patchwork quilt; there\r\nthe skimpy quickest hedges only slightly emphasise the natural sweeping\r\nlines of the hills: here you have narrow winding lanes; there broad,\r\nstraight roads with margins of grass on either side: here you have\r\ncompact villages in which almost all the habitations in the parish are\r\nclustered together; there farmhouses and cottages so scattered that\r\nwere it not for the church, which seems to attract to its neighbourhood\r\nthe inn and the smithy, there would be no recognisable village at all.\r\n\r\nThis diversity in the effect of enclosure on the face of the country is\r\na symbol of the diversity of its effect upon the material, social, and\r\nmoral conditions of the local peasantry, who, like the land itself, may\r\nbe said to have undergone Enclosure.\r\n\r\nWhere, as in Devon and Cornwall, in Cumberland and Westmoreland,\r\nthe division of intermixed arable and meadow land took place early\r\nand gradually, and in subordination to the reclamation of waste,\r\nthat reclamation itself being carried on steadily and gradually, the\r\nresult was the creation of numberless small holdings and properties. A\r\ncareer was offered to the enterprising and laborious, and enterprise\r\nand industry grew accordingly,--“Devonshire myghty and Strong,”\r\nsays Leland; and the great part taken by Devonshire in the national\r\nstruggles in the reign of Elizabeth must be partly attributed to the\r\nreaction upon the character of the people of the conquest over the\r\ndifficulties of bringing the rocky soil, woodland or moor, into\r\ncultivation: a conquest which made Devonshire husbandry famous for two\r\ngenerations, and “Devonshiring” a well-known term for a particular\r\nmethod of preparing waste land for cultivation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest evil of Acts for the enclosure of waste in the\r\npast, was that they prevented such gradual reclamation and enclosure\r\nby peasant cultivators. At the present day the vital objection applies\r\nto enclosure of waste by any method that the area of such free open\r\nspaces is already sufficiently curtailed, that every remaining acre\r\nis becoming continually more precious, so that while public-spirited\r\npeople fight for their preservation in remote places, in the\r\nneighbourhood of towns, citizens tax themselves to add to their area.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure of arable common fields, and of all the commonable lands\r\nof whole parishes within what I have called the Parliamentary Enclosure\r\nBelt, is of immeasurably greater historical importance. The ethics of\r\nsuch enclosure has been the subject of fierce debate for centuries; now\r\nthe process is practically complete, and it is possible to apraise its\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nWe have observed that with regard to the immediate results, capable\r\nof being contemporaneously verified, there is no real controversy\r\nbetween the disputants; it is on the inferences to be drawn as to the\r\nmore ultimate results on the nation as a whole, and in the judgment\r\npronounced upon the desirability of such results, that the dispute\r\nturned. The more candid disputants on either side admit the vital\r\npoints in their opponents’ case: thus, for example, no opponent of\r\nenclosure denies that it tended to raise rents; and, on the other\r\nhand, it was the greatest advocate of enclosure who declared that “By\r\nnineteen out of twenty Enclosure Acts the poor are injured.”\r\n\r\nThe increase of rent was, of course, the motive of enclosure; and\r\nthough there were exceptional cases in which the results were very\r\ndisappointing to the promoters, as a rule the increase of rent was very\r\ngreat. Arthur Young gives the full financial details of twenty-three\r\nActs for the enclosure of open field parishes in Lincolnshire.[108]\r\nThe total rents before enclosure amounted to £15,504; on an average\r\nthey were nearly doubled, the increase of rent obtained being £14,256,\r\nand the expenditure necessary to obtain this result was £48,217.\r\nAssuming that the money was borrowed at 6 per cent., there remained to\r\nthe landowners a net profit of £11,363. These results were no doubt\r\nsomething above the average, but they were not exceptional. In Long\r\nSutton the rent was raised from an average of 5_s._ per acre to between\r\n30_s._ and 50_s._ per acre.[109]\r\n\r\n [108] “Agriculture of Lincoln,” p. 83.\r\n\r\n [109] “Agriculture of Lincoln,” p. 77.\r\n\r\nThe increase of rent was not a concern purely of the landowning class.\r\nAs the advocates of enclosure continually pointed out, the rent was\r\na pretty accurate test of the net produce of the agriculture of the\r\nparish; it was roughly proportional to the amount of food grown but not\r\nconsumed on the spot, and sent away to markets to feed urban consumers\r\nat a distance. It was upon this net produce, they pointed out, that\r\nthe taxable resources of the country depended. It was argued that\r\nan addition to the population of the country which was all engaged\r\nin gaining its own subsistence from the soil, added neither to the\r\nnumber of soldiers who could be enlisted for war without paralysing\r\nindustry, nor to the power of the State to equip and support an army.\r\nOn the other hand, a change by which a whole village of peasants who\r\nconsumed nearly all the food they produced, was swept away and replaced\r\nby one or two highly rented farms, producing a less quantity of food,\r\nbut sending much more to market, did supply the State with additional\r\nresources for the maintenance of its forces.\r\n\r\nPrivate interests stimulated the appreciation of these public\r\nadvantages. Money had to be borrowed to meet the heavy initial\r\nexpenses of enclosure, and the banking system grew with the enclosure\r\nmovement of the eighteenth century. And hence a secondary gain to the\r\nState. Increased opportunities for the remunerative investment of\r\ncapital increased the supply of loanable capital, and made possible\r\nthe enormous State loans by which the Napoleonic war was carried on.\r\nLawyers, land surveyors, Parliamentary agents and others, reaped a\r\ncopious harvest; and further, London in particular, and other towns\r\nin varying measure, grew in wealth by ministering to the increased\r\n“effective demands” of the enriched aristocracy.\r\n\r\nBut the opponents of enclosure were concerned with the gross rather\r\nthan the net produce of land, and, as we have seen, it can be proved\r\nfrom the testimony of the advocates of enclosure and of impartial\r\nwitnesses, that over a great part of the Midlands enclosure meant the\r\nconversion of arable to pasture, and local depopulation. The Board of\r\nAgriculture gives what may be considered an official estimate of the\r\ndiminution of gross produce which would follow. An acre of common field\r\narable might be expected to produce 2010 lbs. of bread in a three years\r\ncourse (that is, 670 lbs. of bread per annum), and 30 lbs. of meat per\r\nannum. The same area enclosed and converted to pasture would produce\r\n176 lbs. of mutton, or 120 lbs. of beef. If we split the difference\r\nbetween the production of beef and mutton, we have on the average 148\r\nlbs. of meat produced. There is on enclosure a gain of 113 lbs. of meat\r\nagainst a loss of 570 lbs. of bread; supposing the food values of equal\r\nquantities of bread and meat to be equal, there is a loss of 557 lbs.\r\nout of a total produce of 705 lbs.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, through a chain of causation which can now be clearly\r\nperceived, but which at the time was not evident, though locally there\r\nmight be a loss of gross produce, there was a gain throughout the\r\nkingdom. The key to the position was the operation of the Poor Laws.\r\n\r\nEnclosure of arable fields and open field parishes in the Parliamentary\r\nEnclosure Belt in many ways greatly affected the operation of the Poor\r\nLaws.\r\n\r\nBy increasing rents it made a given poor-rate yield more. Further, the\r\nincrease of rent reconciled the enclosing landowners to an increase\r\nin the poor-rate; more especially when it fell, not on them, but on\r\ntheir neighbours. For, as we have seen, the effect of enclosure in some\r\nparishes in a given neighbourhood was often to drive the poor into the\r\nparishes which remained unenclosed; these bore the burden, while the\r\nothers reaped the profits.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, enclosure, even when arable was not converted to\r\npasturage, tended to ruin small owners and to eliminate small farmers,\r\nso that these had to join the ranks of agricultural labourers. The\r\nnumber of potential paupers was thus increased.\r\n\r\nDestitution and recklessness among the labouring classes also\r\nincreased. The common rights and small holdings of a few acres in the\r\ncommon fields were, at best, as we have seen, exchanged for a sum of\r\nmoney for which no investment offered itself, which therefore soon\r\ndisappeared. With these small holdings disappeared also the hope of\r\ngradually taking more and more additional strips of land in the fields\r\nand the fear of losing the little already gained.\r\n\r\nEarly marriage was particularly encouraged by the change from the open\r\nfield condition to enclosure. Before enclosure, the conditions of\r\nlabour made the common field farmers who employed labourers, desire\r\nyoung unmarried men and women who would live in the farmhouse; such\r\nfarm servants postponed marriage till they had accumulated some savings\r\nand could begin their married life with some resources--a cow, for\r\nexample--over and above their labour. After enclosure, the enriched\r\nfarming class preferred to pay board wages, and the young labourer with\r\nnothing to gain by waiting, with the assurance of Poor Law assistance\r\nif needed, naturally preferred to marry early.\r\n\r\nLastly, the disappearance of the yeoman class and of the connecting\r\nlinks between the largest farmers and the day labourers naturally\r\ntended to make the careful local administration of the Poor Law\r\nmore difficult; it even to a great extent destroyed the motive for\r\neconomical administration. The open field parish retained some of the\r\nsocial vitality of a self-governing community; men who had to concert\r\ntogether for the regulation of the fields, for the purchase of a parish\r\nbull, were more likely than the farmers of an enclosed parish to settle\r\nin concert questions of Poor Law relief in accordance with the interest\r\nof the parish as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis last point of connection between the enclosure and the Poor Law\r\nhistory of the country during the eighteenth century and the first\r\npart of the nineteenth is, however, interesting in itself, apart from\r\nthe present argument. The point here laid stress upon is that whatever\r\nhardships for labourers and others resulted from the enclosure of\r\narable fields, they did not starve, they did not eat less bread; they\r\nmight be rendered miserable, but they married earlier and reared large\r\nfamilies, somewhere or other. Poor Law relief ensured their offering\r\nan “effective demand” for bread. This effective demand compelled the\r\nincrease of arable cultivation somewhere within the country; for\r\nforeign supplies were practically unavailable. The enclosure of waste\r\nfor tillage and the enclosure of arable for pasture were economically\r\ninter-dependent.\r\n\r\nThe gross agricultural produce of the country as a whole was therefore\r\nincreased by common field enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon urban industries was also great. The greater the local\r\ndepopulation in rural districts produced by enclosure, the greater the\r\nsupply of needy labourers of industrious habits and robust physique\r\ndrafted to the growing industrial towns. Local depopulation was the\r\nusual result of Enclosure, as we have seen, in the Midlands and in\r\nWiltshire, and parts of neighbouring counties. Where, as in Norfolk and\r\nparts of Lincoln and Yorkshire, local depopulation did not ensue, there\r\nwas a vast increase in the agricultural produce sent to market, and in\r\nconsequence, in the manufactured commodities demanded. Enclosure tended\r\nto assist urban industry therefore by an increased labour supply, an\r\nincreased market, and perhaps also, an increased supply of capital.\r\n\r\nSumming up, therefore, the economic results of the whole mass of little\r\nvillage revolutions under examination, we find increased population,\r\nincreased production of all sorts of commodities, increased national\r\nresources for purposes of taxation and foreign war. The moral effects\r\nwe find to have been increased misery and recklessness, showing itself\r\nin increased pauperism and drunkenness. An increase of the quantity of\r\nhuman life is attained at the expense of a degradation in its quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL SUMMARY OF ACTS OF ENCLOSURE ENCLOSING COMMON PASTURE AND\r\nWASTE ONLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n┌─────────┬─────────────────╥──────────────╥─────────────────╥────────┐\r\n│         │                 ║  Acts not    ║                 ║        │\r\n│         │Acts specifying  ║ specifying   ║                 ║        │\r\n│         │    Acreage      ║   Acreage    ║     Total.      ║        │\r\n│         │   Enclosed.     ║  Enclosed.   ║                 ║ Acres  │\r\n│         ├──────┬──────────╫─────┬────────╫──────┬──────────╢Enclosed│\r\n│         │Acts. │ Acreage  ║Acts.│Acreage ║ Acts.│  Acres.  ║  per   │\r\n│         │      │   as     ║     estimated.      │          ║ annum. │\r\n│         │      │ stated.  ║     │        ║      │          ║        │\r\n├─────────┼──────┼──────────╫─────┼────────╫──────┼──────────╫────────┤\r\n│1727–1760│   49 │   65,203 ║   7 │  9,315 ║   56 │   74,518 ║  2,192 │\r\n│1761–1792│  292 │  411,952 ║  47 │ 66,307 ║  339 │  478,259 ║ 14,946 │\r\n│1793–1801│  153 │  230,249 ║  29 │ 43,642 ║  182 │  273,891 ║ 30,432 │\r\n│1802–1815│  469 │  615,970 ║  95 │123,773 ║  564 │  739,743 ║ 52,839 │\r\n│1816–1845│  202 │  164,994 ║  42 │ 34,306 ║  244 │  199,300 ║  6,643 │\r\n├─────────┼──────┼──────────╫─────┼────────╫──────┼──────────╫────────┤\r\n│Totals.  │1,165 │1,488,368 ║ 220 │277,343 ║1,385 │1,765,711 ║        │\r\n└─────────┴──────┴──────────╨─────┴────────╨──────┴──────────╨────────┘\r\n\r\nFrom 1727 to 1760 the number of Acts of this class passed per annum\r\nwas steadily increasing, the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) apparently\r\nacting as a stimulus.

We have in Vol. I., folio 3:--\r\n\r\n“From Leighton to Barnewel Village” (in Northamptonshire) “a vi miles\r\nby exceeding faire Corne and pasture ground.”\r\n\r\n“Thence to Oundle ... the Medowes lying on every side on a great Leavel\r\nthereabouts.”\r\n\r\n“Oundale to Foderingeye, a 2 miles by mervelous fair Corne ground and\r\nPasture, but little wodde.”\r\n\r\n“From Welingborow to Northampton 8 miles al be champaine Corne and\r\nPasture Ground, but little wood or none, even as it is betwixt Oundale\r\nand Welingborow” (fol. 7).\r\n\r\n“Wedon is a praty throughfare, sette on a playne ground” (fol. 11).\r\n\r\n“Towcester is 7 miles from Wedon and as much from Northampton, al by\r\nplayne Corne ground and pasture.”\r\n\r\n“Northampton to Kingesthorpe a mile, and a little farther, by Multon\r\nParke enclosed with Stone ... thens by Champayne Ground, bering good\r\ngrasse and Corne, a ix mile to Ketering” (fol. 12).\r\n\r\n“Thens to Welledon, an uplandish Towne, 4 miles, where the Soile is\r\nsumwhat furnished about with wood, and plentee beside of Corne and\r\nGrasse ... And thens 2 mile by Corne, Pasture and Wood to Deene.”\r\n\r\n“From Dene to Rokingham, by summe Corne and Pasture but more Wood\r\ngrounde a 3 miles” (fol. 13).\r\n\r\n“There lyeth a greate valley under the Castle of Rokingham, very\r\nplentifull of Corne and Grasse ... The Forest ... about 20 mile yn\r\nlength, and in bradthe 5 or 4 Miles in sum places in sum less. And\r\nwithyn the precinctes of it is good Corne and Plentie of Woodde.”\r\n\r\n“Rokingham to Pippewelle, the late Abbay, abut a 3 Miles of by Wood and\r\nPasture.”\r\n\r\n“Dene to Haringworth a 3 Miles be Corne, Grasse, and sum Woody Grounde”\r\n(fol. 14).\r\n\r\nThen entering Leicestershire, he says:--\r\n\r\n“The grounde bytwixt Dene and Staunton is plentiful of corne, and\r\nexceeding faire and large Medowis on both sides of the Weland. But from\r\nRokingham to Staunton there was in sight little Wodde, as yn a Countrey\r\nal Chaumpain. From Staunton to Leycester al by Champaine Grounde an 8\r\nor 9 Miles” (fol. 15).\r\n\r\n“Leyrcester to Brodegate by grounde welle Wooddid 3 miles ... Brodegate\r\nto Groby a Mile and a half much by Woodden lande” (fol. 19).\r\n\r\n“Brodegate to Leighborow about a v Miles. 1st foreste of Charley\r\ncommunely called the Wast, xx miles or more in Cumpace, having plenty\r\nof woode” (fol. 20). The forest of Leyrcester, the other forest of the\r\ncounty, he says, is five miles in length.\r\n\r\n“Brodegate to Bellegrave Village a 4 miles by Woddy and Pasture\r\nGrounde” ... “Bellegrave to Ingresby a 4 Miles, partely by Corne,\r\nPasture, and Woddy ground.... Thens to Wiscombe a 4 Miles by Corne,\r\nPasture and Wood ... faire Orchardes and Gardenes” (fol. 22).\r\n\r\n“_Marke that such parte of Leyrcestershire as is lying South and Est is\r\nChampaine, and hath little Wood. And such parte of Leircestershire as\r\nlyith by West and North hath much woodde_” (fol. 24).\r\n\r\nNext he passes through Rutlandshire into Northamptonshire again:--\r\n\r\n“From Wiscombe partely through Woddy ground of the Forest of Leefield,\r\nand so in Ruthelandshir by Woddy first, and then all champain Ground,\r\nbut exceeding rich Corne and Pasture, to Uppingham ... from Uppingham\r\nto Haringworth (Northamptonshire) 3 little miles, al by Champaine ...\r\nDene to Cliffe Parke 3 Miles; it is partely waullid with stone, and\r\npartely palid. From Dene to Coliweston a 5 or 6 Miles, partely by\r\nChampaine, partely by Woodde ground” (fol. 25).\r\n\r\n“From Coly Weston to Grimesthorpe (in Lincolnshire) about an 8 or 9\r\nmost by playne Ground, good of Corne and Pasture, but little wood”\r\n(fol. 26).\r\n\r\nHis journey then took him northwards, but returning, he again passed\r\nthrough Leicestershire, Rutland and Northamptonshire, and notes:--\r\n\r\n“Notingham to Bever (Belvoir) all by champaine ground, 12 miles” (fol.\r\n113).\r\n\r\n“Bever to Croxton, 2 miles” (fol. 115).\r\n\r\n“Croxton to Castleford Bridge by champaine” (fol. 115).\r\n\r\n“Castleford Bridge to Stamford 1 mile” (fol. 115).\r\n\r\n“Stamford to Colyweston 2½ miles, champayn” (fol. 115).\r\n\r\n“Colyweston to Dene, moste by Chaumpaine” (fol. 115).\r\n\r\n“Dene to Foderingeye, most by wood, 6 miles” (fol. 116).\r\n\r\n“Foderingey to Undale, 2 miles, champaine” (fol. 116).\r\n\r\n“Thens a 9 mile to Layton in Huntingdonshire, Champaine” (fol. 116).\r\n\r\n“To Higham Ferrers in Northamptonshire, 8 miles” (fol. 116).\r\n\r\n“To Bedford, 14 miles, champaine” (fol. 116).\r\n\r\n\r\nWARWICK.\r\n\r\n“From Charlecote to Stratford a 3 Miles by Champaine, good corn and\r\ngrasse” (166 b).\r\n\r\n“I roade from Stratford by champaine Ground, fruitfull of Corne and\r\nGrasse a 5 miles ... thence 2 miles by Champaine to Coughton. From\r\nCoughton to Aulcester 2 miles by enclosed Ground (167 b). I roade from\r\nAulcester towards Evvesham a 2 Miles by woody and inclosed Ground, and\r\nthen a mile by Ground lesse inclosed, but havinge more Corne then wood.\r\nThence a 4 miles by cleane Champion” (168 b).\r\n\r\nHaving thus entered Gloucestershire, he came through Worcester\r\nand Lichfield, and so re-entered Warwickshire from the north, and\r\nfound--“Colishull to Meriden 4 m. by enclosed ground having some\r\ncorne, wood and pasture. 3 miles by like ground to Coventry” (190 a).\r\nTo Southam was “4 m. good corne and pasture in Champion,” thence to\r\nBanbury in Oxfordshire “10 m. by champaine, noe wood but exceedinge\r\ngood Pasture and corne.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\nFrom Dunstable to “Mergate,” as we have seen, was “al by Chaumpaine\r\na vj miles” (vol. 1, fol. 120). But “thens by Chiltern Hilles and\r\nwoods and baren woody and ferne ground vij miles to Barkhanstede” (in\r\nHerts, near the Buckingham boundary, fol. 121). “Thens I passid by\r\nHilly, Woody, and much baren ground to Cheynes (in Bucks) a v miles ...\r\nv miles good Pasture and Corne, v miles mory Ground, and 3 m. by sum\r\nenclosid and Woddy ground to Windelsore. From Windelsore by a 3 miles\r\nmost be wood and enclosid, and 2 m. in faire open and levelle medow ...\r\nto Tamise ... Half a mile to Stanes Bridge” (fol. 122).\r\n\r\nOn a later journey he came from Oxford, and entered Bucks at Thame\r\n“by some Hilly and after great Pasture Groundes, fruitfull of beanes\r\na 10 m. to Querendon in the Vale of Alesbury. Thens 5 m. to Alesbury\r\nall champaine” (Vol. IV. 191 b). But from Hagmondesham (Amersham) to\r\nUxbridge was “9 miles by goodly enclosid grounds.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOXFORDSHIRE.\r\n\r\nHe came from Reading and crossed the river to Caushem (Caversham).\r\n“Thens I rode a v miles and more all by great Woddes. And thens by\r\nChaumpaine hilly ground a 4 m. to Ewelm” (Vol. II. fol. 5). “From Ewelm\r\nto Haseley a v m. by Chaumpaine Ground somewhat plentiful of corn, but\r\nmost layid to Pasturage” (fol. 7). “From Haseley to Chisilhampton by\r\nplaine ground fruteful of corne and Grasse, but baren of wood as al\r\nthat Angle of Oxfordshire is, 3 miles. Thens to Drayton Village. Thens\r\na mile to Dorchester” (fol. 10). “To Walingford 1½ m. by mervelus fair\r\nChampain” (fol. 12). Here he again crossed the Thames into Berkshire;\r\nbut later he entered the north west of the county, and found the\r\ndistrict from Sutton to Banbury “all by champaine barren of wood” (Vol.\r\nIV., fol. 162 b), and the first 12 miles of the road from Banbury to\r\nWarwick “by Champaine Groundes, fruitful of Corne and Grasse” (163\r\na). Similarly from Southam (in Warwickshire) to Banbury was “10 m. by\r\nchampaine, noe wood but exceedinge good Pasture and corne,” and from\r\nBanbury to Bercester (Bicester) was 10 or 11 miles of “champaine.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n“From Coly Weston to Grimesthorpe about an 8 Miles or 9, most by playn\r\nGround, good of corne and pasture, but little wood” (Vol. I. fol. 26).\r\n“From Grimesthorpe to Corby about a 3 Miles by Champayne Ground....\r\nThens to Boutheby a 3 Miles, and thereaboute is meately store of Wodde\r\nscaterid” (fol. 27). “From Boutheby to Hayder al by Champaine ground,\r\nfertile of corne and grasse, 4 Miles. From Hayder to Sleford a vj Miles\r\nal by Champaine grounde (fol. 29). From Sleforde to Ancaster a 4 Miles\r\nby Chaumpaine (fol. 30). Ancaster to Temple Bruern al by Champaine of\r\nAncaster Heth a 4 Miles.... From Temple Bruern to Lincoln 10 Miles\r\nby Champaine” (fol. 32). “Lincoln to Torkesey parte by Marsh Ground,\r\nand part by other, but very little wood, a 7 Miles. Torkesy to Marton\r\nVillage about a mile by plaine sandy ground” (fol. 35).\r\n\r\n\r\nYORKSHIRE, EAST RIDING.\r\n\r\n“From York to Kexby Bridge by Champaine v miles” (Vol. I. fol. 49).\r\nThence he went to Leckenfield, a village a little to the north of\r\nBeverley, “And al this way betwixt York and the Parke of Lekenfeld is\r\nmeately fruteful of Corn and Grass, but it hath little wood” (fol. 49).\r\nHe then went south to Hull and returned to Beverley: “From Kingeston to\r\nBeverle a vj Miles, a v by low pasture and Marsch Ground, and a Mile by\r\nenclosid and sumwhat woddy ground” (fol. 57). Starting from Beverley\r\nagain towards Goole he has “Beverle to Walkington Village a 2 Mile, one\r\nby enclosid, and another by chaumpaine good corne land. Walkington to\r\nNorth Cave Village 5 Miles by fair champain corn ground. Northcave to\r\nScalby a 3 Miles al by low Marsch and Medow Ground” (fol. 57).\r\n\r\n“From Scalby to Hoveden (Howden) 4 M. scant one by enclosid Pasture and\r\n3 by Morische and Fenny ground” (fol. 58). “From Hoveden to Wresehill\r\n(Wressel) a 3 Miles al by low Medow and Pastureground, whereof part\r\nis enclosed with Hegges” (fol. 59). “From Wresehill ... Ferry about a\r\nMile, most by Medow Ground, and so a xj Miles to York, whereof most\r\nparte was in sight Medow and Morisch Ground, and but meane corne, but\r\ntoward York the soyle and corne were better” (fol. 69).\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH AND WEST RIDINGS.\r\n\r\nHe came on his first journey from Scrooby in Notts to Doncaster. He\r\nobserves, “Bawtre to Doncaster an vij Miles by a great Plaine and Sandy\r\nground caullid Blitherle” (Vol. I. fol. 37), Round Doncaster is “Medow,\r\nCorn and sum wood,” but from “Tikhill to Cunesborow (Conisbrough) a 4\r\nMiles by stony way and enclosid ground” (fol. 39), and from “Dancaster\r\nto Heathfield (Hatfield) by champayn sandy ground a 5 Miles,” and here\r\ncomes Hatfield Chase, the scene of Vermuiden’s labours later. He return\r\nto Doncaster and went north and found “The ground between Dancaster and\r\nPontefract in sum places meately wooddid and enclosid ground” (fol.\r\n42); from “pontefract to S. Oswaldes by much enclosid and meately woddy\r\nground a 3 Miles or more” (fol. 44). From St. Oswalds to Sandon village\r\n(a mile from Wakefield), “a 3 Miles by enclosid Ground” (fol. 44). From\r\nWakefield to Pontefract direct was “a vj miles parte by Enclosure,\r\nparte by Champaine” (fol. 46). Thence to Leeds, he found first three\r\nmiles of enclosed ground, then five miles of low meadow, and “good high\r\nplaine corne ground” (fol. 46).\r\n\r\nFrom Leeds to Tadcaster was apparently unenclosed, but from Tadcaster\r\nto York there was first 4 miles of enclosed ground, then four by “playn\r\nChampaine” (fol. 48). “From York to Stockton yn the Moore a 3 Miles by\r\nlow Pasture and moreisch Ground.... Thens a 5 Miles by much lyke Ground\r\n... a little beyond that as about half a M. is Whitewelle Village.\r\nThereabout the Fieldes for a Miles space were inclosid.... Thens a 2\r\nM. by Fyrry. Thens to Malton a 3 Miles, and the ground is hilly there\r\nand daly and plentiful of Corne and Pasture (Vol. I. fol. 63). From\r\nMalton to Shirburne Village about an 8 miles by Champaine Ground. From\r\nShirburne by Hilles to Semar. Thens a Mile by Meately plaine Ground,\r\nand so 2 Miles more in a vale enclosid with stepe Hilles on ech side to\r\nScardeburg (fol. 66).\r\n\r\n“Moste of the Ground from Scardeburg to Pykering was by Hille and Dale\r\nmeate plentiful of Corn and Grasse but little wood in sight” (fol. 70).\r\nThe vale of Pickering was open field land.\r\n\r\nNorth-west of York itself was the great forest of Galtres, ten miles\r\nthrough (fol. 74). At Herperly Village beyond was “meately good corn\r\nground, Pasture and Medow and sum Wooddes” (fol. 75).\r\n\r\nFurther south. “From Kirkeby Wisk to Northalverton a 4 Miles by Pasture\r\nand Corne Ground” (fol. 75).\r\n\r\nReturning later from Durham we have from Greta Bridge to Richmond, “sum\r\ngood corn and much More (fol. 95). Richmond to Middleham, al by mory\r\nGround and little wood” but “Middleham to Gervalx Abbay a 2 Miles most\r\nby enclosed Pastures.” His route lay through Ripon, West Tanfield,\r\nBoroughbridge, to Knaresborough; he notes pasture, corn, wood and moor.\r\nThen comes the great forest of Knaresborough, 20 miles long and 8\r\nbroad. Then he went south through Pontefract and Doncaster, finding\r\nafter Doncaster “3 Mile al by Champain ground” (fol. 105).\r\n\r\nHe came again into Yorkshire from Lancashire, and found by the Ouse\r\nnear York “the ground was fair of Pasture, Corne and wood” (Vol. V.\r\nfol. 91), and from “Shirburne to Pontfract 6 m. soile in sight plaine,\r\nwel cornid, but little wood” (_ibid._), and coming south, there is\r\n“woddy Grounds,” and “soile riche of wood, Pasture, corne,” but no\r\nmention of enclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN COUNTIES.\r\n\r\nLeland’s observations are as follows. He saw, approaching Lechdale\r\non crossing the Thames from Faringdon, “In ripa ulterori ... greate\r\nEnclosures of stone walls” (Vol. II. fol. 22). He turned into\r\nWiltshire, and came from Bradford into the neighbourhood of Bath and\r\nEast Somerset. Burton to South Cadbury, and thence to Sherborne, just\r\nover the Dorset boundary, was “fair and fruteful Champain” (fol. 47),\r\nbut by another route back from Sherborne to South Cadbury “the Pastures\r\nand Fieldes be much enclosid with Hegge Rowes of Elmes” (fol. 50), and\r\na little later he says that “most part of al Somertsetshire is yn hegge\r\nrows enclosid” with elms (fol. 55).\r\n\r\nSome details are given later. Southtown to Midsummer Norton was “hilly\r\nand enclosid,” but Midsummer Norton to Wells “chaumpayne” (Vol. VIII.\r\nfol. 5), but thence south to Munney Delamere “hilly and enclosid” (fol.\r\n7). Midsummer Norton to Mells (near Frome) was champayn (Vol. VIII.\r\npart 2, fol. 78 a). From Bath to Kelston (in Wilts) was champaine (fol.\r\n67 b) and the triangular district between Bristol, Bath and Chipping\r\nSodbury about half enclosed and half “champaine,” and also the district\r\non the other side of the Bristol Avon towards Frome in Somerset, the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of Frome being open (Vol. VII., part 2, fol.\r\n68–77).\r\n\r\nAulcester (in Warwick), to Evesham was “2 Miles by woody and inclosed\r\nground, and then a mile by Ground lesse inclosed.... Thence 4 miles\r\nby cleane Champion” (Vol. IV. fol. 168 b), and the “champion Ground”\r\ncontinued for 6 or 7 miles to Stanwey, on the Cheltenham road.\r\n\r\nNorth-west Worcester seems to have been generally enclosed. We have\r\nBridgenorth (in Shropshire) to Kidderminster “mostly enclosed ground”\r\n(Vol. IV. fol. 182 b). Bewdley to Milton, Milton to Hertlebury, and\r\nhence to Worcester is all described as “enclosed Ground” (183 b and 184\r\na), and so also the country between Worcester and Bromsgrove (185 a and\r\n186 b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\nGENERAL LEGISLATION AFFECTING ENCLOSURE.\r\n\r\n(Previous to the General Enclosure Act of 1845.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUTE OF MERTON (1235), c. 4.\r\n\r\nEnabled lords of manors, on leaving sufficient pasture for their\r\ntenants on the waste, to enclose the residue; but the lord must prove\r\nthat the tenants have sufficient pasture, and means of ingress and\r\negress.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUTE OF WESTMINSTER (1285), c. 46.\r\n\r\nEnabled lords of manors in which the waste was used as a common pasture\r\nby other manors, to enclose against their neighbours, when no specific\r\ngrant of a right of common pasture had been made. It also provided\r\nagainst the creation of new common rights. “By occasion of a Windmill,\r\nSheepcote, Dairy, enlarging of a court necessary, or Courtelage, from\r\nhenceforth no man shall be grieved by Assize of Novel Disseisin for\r\nCommon of Pasture.” If after enclosure under this act the hedges are\r\npulled down, the neighbouring townships may be distrained upon for\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTS FOR THE PROTECTION OF FORESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n21 EDWARD IV. (1482), c. 7.\r\n\r\nIn a forest subject to common rights after a wood has been felled the\r\nland may be enclosed for seven years to protect the young timber.\r\n\r\n\r\n35 HENRY VIII. (1544), c. 17.\r\n\r\nWhere woods are subject to common rights, lords of manors may enclose\r\none fourth of the wood for seven years, and fell the timber, leaving\r\n12 young trees per acre standing. Meanwhile the lord of the manor\r\nsurrenders his common rights upon the remaining three fourths. Kent,\r\nSurrey and Sussex were excluded from the operation of the act.\r\n\r\n\r\n13 ELIZABETH (1571), c. 25.\r\n\r\nThis makes the preceding Act perpetual.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOPULATION ACTS.\r\n\r\nThe preamble of the first of this series of Acts, though well known, is\r\nhere quoted in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 HENRY VII. (1489), c. 19.\r\n\r\n“Our King and Sovereign Lord ... remembreth that ... great\r\ninconveniences do daily increase by desolation and pulling downe, and\r\nwilfull waste of houses and townes within this realme and laying to\r\nPasture Lands, which customably have been used in tillage, whereby\r\nidlenesse, which is the ground and beginning of all mischiefes, daily\r\ndoth encrease. For where in some townes two hundred persons were\r\noccupied and lived by their lawfull labours, now there are occupied two\r\nor three heardmen, and the residue fall into idlenesse, the husbandrie,\r\nwhich is one of the greatest commodities of this Realme is greatly\r\ndecayed, Churches destroyed, the service of God withdrawn, the bodies\r\nthere buried, not prayed for....”\r\n\r\nTo check these evils all occupiers of 20 acres and upwards of land that\r\nhad been tilled in the previous three years, are required to maintain\r\ntillage, under pain of forfeiting to the lord of the manor one half of\r\nthe profits of such land.\r\n\r\n\r\n6 HENRY VIII. (1515), c. 5.\r\n\r\nThis was a temporary Act, in principle identical with the one passed in\r\nthe following session.\r\n\r\n\r\n7 HENRY VIII. (1516), c. 1.\r\n\r\nThis Act applied only to parishes “whereof the more part was or were\r\nused and occupied to tillage and husbandry.” In such places “If any\r\nperson shall decay a Town, a Hamlet, or House of Husbandry, or convert\r\ntillage into Pasture” and have not “within j. yeere next after such\r\nwylfull decaye reedefyed and made ageyn mete and convenyent for people\r\nto dwell and inhabyte the same, and have use, and therein to exercyse\r\nhusbandry and tyllage” he forfeits one half of his land to the lord of\r\nthe manor, until the offence is reformed. Land converted to pasture\r\nmust again be tilled “after the maner and usage of the countrey where\r\nthe seyd land lyeth.”\r\n\r\nThis Act was followed by the Inquisition of 1517.\r\n\r\n\r\nACT FOR RESTRAINING SHEEP FARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\n25 HENRY VIII. (1534), c. 13.\r\n\r\nThis is an Act to deal with the economic cause of depopulating\r\nenclosures.\r\n\r\n“Sundry persons have of late daily studied how to gather into few hands\r\ngreat multitude of Farms and great Plenty of Cattle, and in especial\r\nSheep, putting such land as they can get to Pasture, and not to\r\ntillage, whereby they have not only pulled down Churches and Towns and\r\ninhanced the old Rates ... so that poor men are not able to meddle with\r\nit ... it is thought that the great occasions that moveth and provoketh\r\nthose greedy and covetous people ... is only the great Profit that\r\ncometh of Sheep.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that “some have 24,000, some 20,000, some 10,000, some\r\n6,000, some 5,000 and some more, some less.”\r\n\r\nIt is enacted that with certain exceptions no one may keep more than\r\n2,000 sheep under a penalty of 3_s._ 4_d._ per sheep per annum, half of\r\nthe fine going to the crown, half to the informer. No man, further, may\r\ntake more than two farms, and these must not be in the same parish.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOPULATION ACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n27 HENRY VIII. (1536), c. 22.\r\n\r\nThis Act recites 4 Henry VII., c. 19, the first of the Depopulation\r\nActs; and states that it had been enforced only in lands held\r\nimmediately of the King. Now “the King shall have the Moiety of\r\nthe Profits of those lands already converted for Tillage to Pasture\r\nsithence three years before Ann. 4 H. 7 until the Owner hath builded\r\nup a convenient House to inhabit, and converted the same Pasture to\r\nTillage again; and also take the Moiety of the issues of those lands\r\nhereafter to be converted, if the immediate Lord do it not within one\r\nyear,” until the owners have built a Tenement for every 50, 40 or\r\n30 acres, and have reconverted the pasture to tillage. Again it is\r\nstipulated that the land shall be tilled “according to the nature of\r\nthe soil and the course of Husbandry used in the country where any such\r\nlands do lie.”\r\n\r\n\r\n27 HENRY VIII. (1536), c. 28.\r\n\r\nPersons to whom monastic lands had been granted by Henry VIII. are\r\nrequired to maintain yearly as much of the land in tillage and\r\nhusbandry as had commonly been so used within the preceding 20 years,\r\nunder a penalty of 6_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ per month.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIRMATION OF STATUTE OF MERTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 & 4 EDWARD VI. (1550), c. 3.\r\n\r\nThis Act cites and confirms the Statutes of Merton and Westminster\r\nand facilitates the recovery of damages for breaking down the hedges\r\nerected to enclose wastes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOPULATION ACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n5 & 6 EDWARD VI. (1552), c. 5.\r\n\r\nThis Act requires that so much land be tilled yearly in any parish as\r\nhad been tilled at any time since the accession of Henry VIII., under a\r\npenalty of 5_s._ per acre per annum.\r\n\r\nFour Commissioners were to be appointed to enquire into the conversion\r\nof arable into pasture.\r\n\r\nThe Act did not apply to--\r\n\r\n    (1) Land that had been pasture for 40 years.\r\n    (2) Waste ground, common downs, fens, moors, marshes.\r\n    (3) Lawful warren.\r\n    (4) Woodland converted into pasture.\r\n    (5) Land in deer parks.\r\n    (6) Salt marshes and inundated land.\r\n    (7) Land enclosed by licence of the King or his predecessor.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 & 3 PHILIP AND MARY (1555–6), c. 2.\r\n\r\nThis cites and confirms the original Depopulation Act of 4 Henry VII.\r\nand makes it apply to all houses with 20 acres of land, whether the\r\nland is in tillage or not.\r\n\r\nCommissioners to be appointed to enquire into all grounds converted\r\ninto pasture since St. George’s Day, in the 20th year of Henry VIII. to\r\nsee to the re-edifying of houses, and the reconversion of pasture into\r\ntillage. The exceptions permitted are where lands have been enclosed\r\nby the King’s licence, and by discretion of the Commissioners in cases\r\nwhere no public benefit, but individual hardship would ensue by the\r\nexecution of the Act.\r\n\r\nRents increased on the conversion of tillage into pasture were to be\r\nabated; re-edified houses were to be let with 20 acres of land or 10\r\nacres if the owner has no more.\r\n\r\nThe penalty of laying land down into pasture was again fixed at 5_s._\r\nper acre per annum, half to be paid to the Crown, half to the informer.\r\n\r\n\r\n5 ELIZABETH (1563), c. 2.\r\n\r\nBy this Act the more recent Depopulation Acts, 27 Henry VIII. c. 28, 5\r\n& 6 Edward VI. c. 5, and 2 & 3 Philip and Mary, c. 2, were repealed as\r\nineffectual; but the earlier ones, 4 Henry VII. c. 19, 7 Henry VIII. c.\r\n22 and 27 Henry VIII. c. 22, ordered to be put into execution.\r\n\r\nIt was also enacted that “such lands or so much in quantity in any\r\nplace as hath been put in Tillage and eared in any one year and so kept\r\nfour years sithence the feast of St. George the Martyr, anno 20 Henry\r\nVIII. shall be eared and kept in Tillage, according to the Nature of\r\nthe Soil and Custom of the Country by the Occupier thereof.”\r\n\r\nThe penalty was raised to 10_s._ per acre per annum, and it could be\r\nrecovered by the next heir in reversion if he sued for it within a\r\nyear, if not, by the Remainderman, or in default by the lord of the\r\nmanor, and if not so recovered, by the Crown.\r\n\r\nThis Act remained in force for thirty years, but was discontinued by 35\r\nElizabeth (1593), c. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nACT FOR THE PROTECTION OF COTTAGERS’ HOLDINGS AND RIGHTS OF COMMON.\r\n\r\n\r\n31 ELIZABETH (1589), c. 7.\r\n\r\nThis Act prohibited the letting of cottages to agricultural labourers\r\nwith less than four acres of land under a penalty of 40_s._ per cottage\r\nper month, or the occupation of one cottage by more than one family,\r\nunder a penalty of 10_s._ per cottage per month. The amount of land\r\nattached to cottages let to countrymen following other occupations was\r\nalso regulated. These holdings were evidently intended to be acres in\r\nthe arable fields, carrying with them the proportional common rights of\r\npasturage, &c. This Act was repealed in 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOPULATION ACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n39 ELIZABETH (1597), c. 1.\r\n\r\nIn the preamble of this Act it is stated that in late years more than\r\nin times past, sundry towns, parishes and houses of husbandry have been\r\ndestroyed and become desolate. All previous Acts for the re-edification\r\nof houses are repealed, and it is enacted that when houses of husbandry\r\nhave been decayed for more than seven years, half the number must be\r\nrebuilt, and 40 acres of land allotted to them; unless the property had\r\nbeen sold meanwhile; in that case the purchaser need only rebuild one\r\nquarter of the decayed houses.\r\n\r\nWhere houses had decayed within the previous seven years, they are to\r\nbe rebuilt; and if previously they had less than 40 acres of land, they\r\nmust now at least have 20 acres; if previously they had 40 acres or\r\nmore, they must now have at least 40 acres.\r\n\r\nThe penalty for not rebuilding the farmhouse, was £10 per house per\r\nannum; for not assigning the prescribed quantity of land, 10_s._ per\r\nacre per annum. One third of the penalty went to the Queen, one third\r\nto the parish, one third to the informer.\r\n\r\nIt is also enacted that it shall be lawful for any lord of the manor to\r\nmake exchanges of lands, whether arable, pasture or meadow, with his\r\ntenants, and for the tenants, with the consent of the lord, to make\r\nexchanges with one another, for the sake of more convenient occupation\r\nand husbandry. In other words the re-arrangement of the intermixed\r\nholdings in common arable fields and common meadows is expressly\r\nsanctioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n39 ELIZABETH (1597), c. 2.\r\n\r\nThe preamble states that from the 7th year of Henry VII.’s reign to\r\nthe 35th year of the current reign there had always been in force some\r\nAct for the maintenance of tillage, but in the latter year all such\r\nlaws were discontinued; and that in consequence in the period 1593–1597\r\n“there have growen many more Depopulacions by turning Tillage into\r\nPasture than at any time for the like number of years heretofore.”\r\n\r\nIt is enacted that lands converted from tillage to pasture shall be\r\nre-converted within three years, and that lands now in tillage shall\r\nremain so, under a penalty of 20_s._ per acre per annum. The Act\r\napplies to the counties of Bedford, Berkshire, Buckingham, Cambridge,\r\nDerby, Dorset, Durham, Gloucester, Hampshire, Hereford, Huntingdon,\r\nLeicester, Lincoln, Northampton, Northumberland, Nottingham, Oxford,\r\nRutland, Somerset, Warwick, Wiltshire, Worcester, Yorkshire, with the\r\nIsle of Wight, and Pembroke in South Wales.\r\n\r\nIt did not apply to Cheshire, Cornwall, Cumberland, Devon, Essex,\r\nHertford, Kent, Lancashire, Middlesex, Monmouth, Norfolk, Shropshire,\r\nStafford, Suffolk, Surrey, Sussex and Westmoreland.\r\n\r\nThis Act remained on the Statute Book for 266 years. The earlier\r\nDepopulation Acts were repealed by 21 James I., c. 28, but this Act\r\nremained theoretically part of the law of the land until repealed\r\nby the Statute Law Revision Act of 1863. This was the last of the\r\nDepopulation Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ENCLOSURE ACT.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 JAMES I. c. 11.\r\n\r\nThis is really a local Enclosure Act. The people of the parishes of\r\nMerden, Bodenham, Wellington, Sutton St. Michael, Sutton St. Nicholas,\r\nMurton-upon-Lug, and Pipe in Hereford, had all their lands, whether\r\nmeadow, pasture or arable, open and intermixed, and commonable “after\r\nSickle and Sithe.” They themselves were accustomed to house their\r\nsheep and cattle throughout the year, and the people of neighbouring\r\nvillages took advantage of this custom to turn in cattle after harvest.\r\nThe enclosure of one third of the land in each parish is authorised by\r\nthe Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTS FOR IMPROVING THE CULTIVATION OF COMMON FIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n13 GEORGE III. (1773), c. 81.\r\n\r\nThis Act has been considered in the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n41 GEORGE III. (1801), c. 20.\r\n\r\nThis was a temporary Act to encourage the cultivation of potatoes in\r\ncommon arable fields. The famine prices of 1800–1 caused a good deal of\r\ncurious special legislation. Any occupier of land in common fields is\r\nauthorised to plant potatoes, and to guard them from cattle grazing in\r\nthe fields, on giving compensation for the loss of the common right to\r\nthe other occupiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTS FOR FACILITATING ENCLOSURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n41 GEORGE III. (1801), c. 109.\r\n\r\nThis is the General Enclosure Act promoted by the Board of Agriculture\r\nof 1793–1819. It is entitled “An Act for consolidating in one Act\r\ncertain provisions usually inserted in Acts of inclosure, and for\r\nfacilitating the mode of proving the several facts usually required in\r\nthe passing of such Acts.”\r\n\r\n\r\n1 & 2 GEORGE IV. (1821), c. 23.\r\n\r\nThis amends the previous Act, so as to better regulate the cultivation\r\nof parishes during the progress of enclosure by Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 & 2 WILLIAM IV. (1831), c. 42.\r\n\r\nBy this the churchwardens and overseers of a parish may enclose, up to\r\n50 acres of waste, with the consent of the lord of the manor and the\r\nmajority of the owners of common rights, for the relief of the poor\r\nrates, or let the land so enclosed to poor and industrious persons. By\r\nanother Act in the same session (c. 57) the principle is applied to\r\nCrown lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 & 5 WILLIAM IV. (1834), c. 30.\r\n\r\nAn Act to facilitate the exchange of intermixed lands in common fields,\r\nby removing difficulties caused by some owners being minors, insane, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n6 & 7 WILLIAM IV. (1836), c. 115.\r\n\r\nThis is an important Act “for facilitating the enclosure of open and\r\narable fields in England and Wales.” Two-thirds in number and value\r\nof common arable fields may appoint commissioners for carrying out\r\nenclosure, as if enclosure had been authorised by a special Act. The\r\nawards were to be deposited in the parish churches.\r\n\r\nIf seven-eighths of the proprietors were agreed, enclosure could be\r\ncarried out without the appointment of commissioners.\r\n\r\nThis Act is not to authorise the enclosure of common fields within\r\n10 miles of the centre of London, within 1 mile from the centre of a\r\ntown of 5,000 inhabitants, 1½ miles from one of 15,000 inhabitants,\r\n2 miles from one of 30,000 inhabitants, 2½ miles from one of 70,000\r\ninhabitants, or 3 miles from one of 100,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 & 4 VICT. (1840), c. 31.\r\n\r\nThis was an Act amending the last, by extending its scope to lammas\r\nmeadows; and providing that persons who were dissatisfied with awards\r\nunder the preceding Act forfeited their right of appeal if they took\r\npossession of the lands allotted to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\nA NORFOLK OPEN FIELD PARISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of Runton, adjoining Cromer, is unenclosed, and throws\r\nsome light on Norfolk common field custom, and on the curious law\r\nwith regard to “liberties of fold courses.” There are in the parish\r\ntwo villages, East and West Runton. Most of the land in the parish is\r\neither common, or open field arable land. Of the open field arable,\r\nabout 600 acres are “half year land” and between four and five hundred\r\nacres “whole year land.” Both the whole year land and the half year\r\nland is intermixed, both in ownership and occupation, but the extent\r\nof intermixture has been steadily and continuously reduced. There is\r\na tendency for adjoining strips of land to be let to one and the same\r\nfarmer, and he is allowed to plough down the balks, in Runton called\r\n_lawns_ or _loons_, which separate them. There are no common rights\r\nover the whole year land. There is an area of whole year land of 200\r\nacres or more around each village, which is where one would expect to\r\nfind it; and very curiously, a detached area of about 20 acres half way\r\nbetween the villages. There is no well marked boundary separating whole\r\nyear from half year lands.\r\n\r\nThe half year lands are commonable from Michaelmas to Lady Day old\r\nstyle, that is from October 11th to April 11th. There is no prescribed\r\nrule of cultivation, but the customary course is:--first year, wheat;\r\nsecond, turnips; third, barley sown with clover, the land under this\r\ncrop being “new ley land” after the barley is reaped; and in the fourth\r\nyear the land remains under clover and is called “old ley land” or\r\n“ollay land.”\r\n\r\nThe peculiar feature, characteristic of Norfolk common field\r\nagriculture, is that the owner of the Abbey Farm _in the next parish_,\r\nhas the right to pasture sheep on the half year lands of Runton; in\r\nthe words of the old Act, he has the “liberty of fold courses” of\r\nRunton. Further, the Runton common right owners make up a flock called\r\n“The Collet Flock,” and it is understood that wherever the Abbey flock\r\ngoes, the Collet Flock can go too.\r\n\r\nBut the two flocks are kept distinct, grazing separately, each with its\r\nown shepherd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acreage of commons and common fields, 36\r\n\r\n  Acreage under wheat, 108\r\n\r\n  Acts for enclosing common fields, 7\r\n\r\n  Acts for enclosing waste, 7\r\n\r\n  Ackworth (Yorks.), 123\r\n\r\n  Adams, H.

Post 8vo, with Index, 650 pp.  Price 16s. net.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ADVERTISEMENT._\r\n ──────────────\r\n\r\nMore than that of any other Anglo-Saxon country, English Local\r\nGovernment is rooted in the past, and its contemporary problems\r\ncan be neither fully understood nor adequately solved without a\r\nknowledge of how they have arisen. This work, the first fruits of\r\nseven years’ investigation into the development of English Local\r\nGovernment, combines a detailed history of local administration in\r\nparish and county throughout England and Wales from 1689 to 1835, with\r\na descriptive analysis of the interesting constitutional evolution of\r\nthis most fruitful period, when local authorities were practically free\r\nfrom supervision or control.\r\n\r\nAvoiding discussions as to the origins of English local institutions,\r\nor even as to their growth during the Middle Ages, it describes in\r\nvivid detail the development of structure and function which led to\r\nthe reforms of 1832–35, on which our present system is based. This\r\ndescription is framed on new lines and drawn almost entirely from\r\nmaterials hitherto unused. Instead of dealing principally with the law\r\nof local government, and the successive changes in the Statute-book,\r\nthe institutions themselves, and the persons who worked them, are\r\ndescribed as vital social tissue. The subject matter is, in fact, not\r\nlaw or politics, but the life-history of the various species of local\r\ngoverning bodies.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript records of county and parish from Northumberland to\r\nCornwall, from Cardigan to Kent, elucidated by contemporary literature\r\nand biography, enable the authors to present an entirely new picture of\r\nthe internal history of England in the eighteenth century, revealing\r\nwhat Justice of the Peace and Churchwarden really were, in their habits\r\nas they lived, the way in which the daily administration of the Parish\r\nand County was actually carried on, the manner in which the daily life\r\nof the people was affected by contemporary influences, and the result,\r\nboth on the health and character of the nation, and in producing the\r\ndifficulties that in the twentieth century confront us.\r\n\r\nThe present work is complete in itself. Subsequent volumes will deal\r\nsimilarly with Seignorial Franchises and Municipal Corporations,\r\nStatutory Bodies for Special Purposes, Local Administration in relation\r\nto Poverty and Crime and in relation to Public Health and Convenience,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONGMANS, GREEN & CO.,\r\n  LONDON, NEW YORK AND BOMBAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER WORKS BY SIDNEY AND BEATRICE WEBB.\r\n\r\n\r\n =INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY.= Post 8vo; Seventh Thousand; new edition in one\r\n vol., with new Introductory Chapter (1902); lxi. and 929 pp., with two\r\n diagrams.
