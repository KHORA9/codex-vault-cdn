But, before deciding\r\nupon the mode of constructing these formidable and costly affairs, and\r\nbefore ordering them, she has desired to ascertain their efficacy and\r\nthe respective merits of the chilled iron armor which was recently in\r\nfashion and of rolled iron, which looks as if it were to be the fashion\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--MOUGIN'S ROLLED IRON TURRET.]\r\n\r\nThe Krupp works have recommended and constructed a cupola of\r\ncasehardened iron, while the Saint Chamond works have offered a turret\r\nof rolled iron. Both of these recommend themselves by various merits,\r\nand by remarkably ingenious arrangements, and it only remains to be seen\r\nhow they will behave under the fire of the largest pieces of artillery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nWe are far in advance of the time when cannons with smooth bore were\r\nobliged to approach to within a very short range of a scarp in order to\r\nopen a breach, and we are far beyond that first rifled artillery which\r\neffected so great a revolution in tactics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nTo-day we station the batteries that are to tear open a rampart at\r\ndistances therefrom of from 1,000 to 2,000 yards, and the long, 6 inch\r\ncannon that arms them has for probable deviations, under a charge of 20\r\npounds of powder, and at a distance of 1,000 yards, 28 feet in range, 16\r\ninches in direct fire and 8 inches in curved.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the projectile is 88 pounds, and its remanent velocity at\r\nthe moment of impact is 1,295 feet. Under this enormous live force, the\r\nmasonry gradually crumbles, and carries along the earth of the parapet,\r\nand opens a breach for the assaulting columns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4--STATE OF A CUPOLA AFTER THE ACTION OF\r\nTHIRTY-SEVEN 6 IN. PROJECTILES.]\r\n\r\nIn order to protect the masonry of the scarp, engineers first lowered\r\nthe cordon to the level of the covert-way. Under these circumstances,\r\nthe enemy, although he could no longer see it, reached it by a curved or\r\n\"plunging\" shot. When, in fact, for a given distance we load a gun with\r\nthe heaviest charge that it will stand, the trajectory, AMB (Fig. 2), is\r\nas depressed as possible, and the angles, a and a', at the start and\r\narrival are small, and we have a direct shot. If we raise the chase of\r\nthe piece, the projectile will describe a curve in space which would be\r\na perfect parabola were it not for the resistance of the air, and the\r\nsummit of such curve will rise in proportion as the angle so increases.\r\nSo long as the falling angle, a, remains less than 45°, we shall have a\r\ncurved shot. When the angle exceeds this, the shot is called \"vertical.\"\r\nIf we preserve the same charge, the parabolic curve in rising will meet\r\nthe horizontal plane at a greater distance off. This is, as well known,\r\nthe process employed for reaching more and more distant objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--STATE OF A CAST-IRON CUPOLA AFTER THE BREAKAGE\r\nOF A VOUSSOIR.]\r\n\r\nThe length of a gun depends upon the maximum charge burned in it, since\r\nthe combustion must be complete when the projectile reaches the open\r\nair. It results from this that although guns of great length are capable\r\nof throwing projectiles with small charges, it is possible to use\r\nshorter pieces for this purpose--such as howitzers for curved shots and\r\nmortars for vertical ones. The curved shot finds one application in the\r\nopening of breaches in scarp walls, despite the existence of a covering\r\nof great thickness. If, from a point, a (Fig. 3), we wish to strike the\r\npoint, b, of a scarp, over the crest, c, of the covert-way, it will\r\nsuffice to pass a parabolic curve through these three points--the\r\nunknown data of the problem, and the charge necessary, being\r\nascertained, for any given piece, from the artillery tables. In such\r\ncases it is necessary to ascertain the velocity at the impact, since the\r\nforce of penetration depends upon the live force (mv²) of the\r\nprojectile, and the latter will not penetrate masonry unless it have\r\nsufficient remanent velocity. Live force, however, is not the sole\r\nfactor that intervenes, for it is indispensable to consider the angle at\r\nwhich the projectile strikes the wall. Modern guns, such as the Krupp 6\r\ninch and De Bange 6 and 8 inch, make a breach, the two former at a\r\nfalling angle of 22°, and the latter at one of 30°. It is not easy to\r\nlower the scarps enough to protect them from these blows, even by\r\nnarrowing the ditch in order to bring them near the covering mass of the\r\nglacis.\r\n\r\nThe same guns are employed for dismounting the defender's pieces, which\r\nhe covers as much as possible behind the parapet. Heavy howitzers\r\ndestroy the _materiel_, while shrapnel, falling nearly vertically, and\r\nbursting among the men, render all operations impossible upon an open\r\nterre-plein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--STATE OF A CHILLED IRON CUPOLA BROKEN BY A 12\r\nINCH BALL.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of 6 and 8 inch rifled mortars is remarkable. The Germans\r\nhave a 9 inch one that weighs 3,850 pounds, and the projectile of which\r\nweighs 300. But French mortars in nowise cede to those of their\r\nneighbors; Col. De Bange, for example, has constructed a 10½ inch one of\r\nwonderful power and accuracy.\r\n\r\nSeeing the destructive power of these modern engines of war, it may well\r\nbe asked how many pieces the defense will be able to preserve intact for\r\nthe last period of a siege--for the very moment at which it has most\r\nneed of a few guns to hold the assailants in check and destroy the\r\nassaulting columns. Engineers have proposed two methods of protecting\r\nthese few indispensable pieces. The first of these consists in placing\r\neach gun under a masonry vault, which is covered with earth on all sides\r\nexcept the one that contains the embrasure, this side being covered with\r\narmor plate.\r\n\r\nThe second consists in placing one or two guns under a metallic cupola,\r\nthe embrasures in which are as small as possible. The cannon, in a\r\nvertical aim, revolves around the center of an aperture which may be of\r\nvery small dimensions. As regards direct aim, the carriages are\r\nabsolutely fixed to the cupola, which itself revolves around a vertical\r\naxis. These cupolas may be struck in three different ways: (1) at right\r\nangles, by a direct shot, and consequently with a full charge--very\r\ndangerous blows, that necessitate a great thickness of the armor plate;\r\n(2) obliquely, when the projectile, if the normal component of its real\r\nvelocity is not sufficient to make it penetrate, will be deflected\r\nwithout doing the plate much harm; and (3) by a vertical shot that may\r\nstrike the armor plate with great accuracy.\r\n\r\nGeneral Brialmont says that the metal of the cupola should be able to\r\nwithstand both penetration and breakage; but these two conditions\r\nunfortunately require opposite qualities. A metal of sufficient\r\nductility to withstand breakage is easily penetrated, and, conversely,\r\none that is hard and does not permit of penetration does not resist\r\nshocks well. Up to the present, casehardened iron (Gruson) has appeared\r\nto best satisfy the contradictory conditions of the problem. Upon the\r\ntempered exterior of this, projectiles of chilled iron and cast steel\r\nbreak upon striking, absorbing a part of their live force for their own\r\nbreakage.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Commandant Mougin performed some experiments with a chilled iron\r\nturret established after these plans. The thickness of the metal\r\nnormally to the blows was 23½ inches, and the projectiles were of cast\r\nsteel. The trial consisted in firing two solid 12 in. navy projectiles,\r\n46 cylindrical 6 in. ones, weighing 100 lb., and 129 solid, pointed\r\nones, 12 in. in diameter. The 6 inch projectiles were fired from a\r\ndistance of 3,280 feet, with a remanent velocity of 1,300 feet. The\r\ndifferent phases of the experiment are shown in Figs. 4, 5, and 6. The\r\ncupola was broken; but it is to be remarked that a movable and\r\nwell-covered one would not have been placed under so disadvantageous\r\ncircumstances as the one under consideration, upon which it was easy to\r\nsuperpose the blows. An endeavor was next made to substitute a tougher\r\nmetal for casehardened iron, and steel was naturally thought of. But\r\nhammered steel broke likewise, and a mixed or compound metal was still\r\nless successful. It became necessary, therefore, to reject hard metals,\r\nand to have recourse to malleable ones; and the one selected was rolled\r\niron. Armor plate composed of this latter has been submitted to several\r\ntests, which appear to show that a thickness of 18 inches will serve as\r\na sufficient barrier to the shots of any gun that an enemy can\r\nconveniently bring into the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--CASEMATE OF CHILLED IRON AFTER RECEIVING\r\nNINETY-SIX SHOTS.]\r\n\r\n_Armor Plated Casemates_.--Fig. 7 shows the state of a chilled iron\r\ncasemate after a vigorous firing. The system that we are about to\r\ndescribe is much better, and is due to Commandant Mougin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--MOUGIN'S ARMOR-PLATE CASEMATE.]\r\n\r\nThe gun is placed under a vault whose generatrices are at right angles\r\nto the line of fire (Fig. 8), and which contains a niche that traverses\r\nthe parapet. This niche is of concrete, and its walls in the vicinity of\r\nthe embrasure are protected by thick iron plate. The rectangular armor\r\nplate of rolled iron rests against an elastic cushion of sand compactly\r\nrammed into an iron plate caisson. The conical embrasure traverses this\r\ncushion by means of a cast-steel piece firmly bolted to the caisson, and\r\napplied to the armor through the intermedium of a leaden ring.\r\nExternally, the cheeks of the embrasure and the merlons consist of\r\nblocks of concrete held in caissons of strong iron plate. The\r\nsurrounding earthwork is of sand. For closing the embrasure, Commandant\r\nMougin provides the armor with a disk, c, of heavy rolled iron, which\r\ncontains two symmetrical apertures. This disk is movable around a\r\nhorizontal axis, and its lower part and its trunnions are protected by\r\nthe sloping mass of concrete that covers the head of the casemate. A\r\nwindlass and chain give the disk the motion that brings one of its\r\napertures opposite the embrasure or that closes the latter. When this\r\nportion of the disk has suffered too much from the enemy's fire, a\r\nsimple maneuver gives it a half revolution, and the second aperture is\r\nthen made use of.\r\n\r\n_The Schumann-Gruson Chilled Iron Cupola_.--This cupola (Fig. 9) is\r\ndome-shaped, and thus offers but little surface to direct fire; but it\r\ncan be struck by a vertical shot, and it may be inquired whether its top\r\ncan withstand the shock of projectiles from a 10 inch rifled mortar. It\r\nis designed for two 6 inch guns placed parallel. Its internal diameter\r\nis 19½ feet, and the dome is 8 inches in thickness and has a radius of\r\n16½ feet. It rests upon a pivot, p, around which it revolves through the\r\nintermedium of rollers placed in a circle, r. The dome is of relatively\r\nsmall bulk--a bad feature as regards resistance to shock. To obviate\r\nthis difficulty, the inventor partitions it internally in such a way as\r\nto leave only sufficient space to maneuver the guns. The partitions\r\nconsist of iron plate boxes filled with concrete. The form of the dome\r\nhas one inconvenience, viz., the embrasure in it is necessarily very\r\noblique, and offers quite an elongated ellipse to blows, and the edges\r\nof the bevel upon a portion of the circumference are not strong enough.\r\nIn order to close the embrasure as tightly as possible, the gun is\r\nsurrounded with a ring provided with trunnions that enter the sides of\r\nthe embrasure. The motion of the piece necessary to aim it vertically is\r\neffected around this axis of rotation. The weight of the gun is balanced\r\nby a system of counterpoises and the chains, l, and the breech\r\nterminates in a hollow screw, f, and a nut, g, held between two\r\ndirecting sectors, h. The cupola is revolved by simply acting upon the\r\nrollers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--THE SCHUMANN-GRUSON CUPOLA.]\r\n\r\n_Mougin's Rolled Iron Cupola_.--The general form of this cupola (Fig. 1)\r\nis that of a cylindrical turret. It is 12¾ feet in diameter, and rises\r\n3¼ feet above the top of the glacis. It has an advantage over the one\r\njust described in possessing more internal space, without having so\r\nlarge a diameter; and, as the embrasures are at right angles with the\r\nsides, the plates are less weakened. The turret consists of three plates\r\nassembled by slit and tongue joints, and rests upon a ring of strong\r\niron plate strengthened by angle irons. Vertical partitions under the\r\ncheeks of the gun carriages serve as cross braces, and are connected\r\nwith each other upon the table of the hydraulic pivot around which the\r\nentire affair revolves. This pivot terminates in a plunger that enters a\r\nstrong steel press-cylinder embedded in the masonry of the lower\r\nconcrete vault.\r\n\r\nThe iron plate ring carries wheels and rollers, through the intermedium\r\nof which the turret is revolved. The circular iron track over which\r\nthese move is independent of the outer armor.\r\n\r\nThe whole is maneuvered through the action of one man upon the piston of\r\na very small hydraulic press. The guns are mounted upon hydraulic\r\ncarriages. The brake that limits the recoil consists of two bronze pump\r\nchambers, a and b (Fig. 10). The former of these is 4 inches in\r\ndiameter, and its piston is connected with the gun, while the other is 8\r\ninches in diameter, and its piston is connected with two rows of 26\r\ncouples of Belleville springs, d. The two cylinders communicate through\r\na check valve.\r\n\r\nWhen the gun is in battery, the liquid fills the chamber of the 4 inch\r\npump, while the piston of the 8 inch one is at the end of its stroke. A\r\nrecoil has the effect of driving in the 4 inch piston and forcing the\r\nliquid into the other chamber, whose piston compresses the springs. At\r\nthe end of the recoil, the gunner has only to act upon the valve by\r\nmeans of a hand-wheel in order to bring the gun into battery as slowly\r\nas he desires, through the action of the springs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--MOUGIN'S HYDRAULIC GUN CARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nFor high aiming, the gun and the movable part of its carriage are\r\ncapable of revolving around a strong pin, c, so placed that the axis of\r\nthe piece always passes very near the center of the embrasure, thus\r\npermitting of giving the latter minimum dimensions. The chamber of the 8\r\ninch pump is provided with projections that slide between circular\r\nguides, and carries the strap of a small hydraulic piston, p, that\r\nsuffices to move the entire affair in a vertical plane, the gun and\r\nmovable carriage being balanced by a counterpoise, q.\r\n\r\nThe projectiles are hoisted to the breech of the gun by a crane.\r\n\r\nBetween the outer armor and turret sufficient space is left for a man to\r\nenter, in order to make repairs when necessary.\r\n\r\nEach of the rolled iron plates of which the turret consists weighs 19\r\ntons. The cupolas that we have examined in this article have been\r\nconstructed on the hypothesis than an enemy will not be able to bring\r\ninto the field guns of much greater caliber than 6 inches.--_Le Genie\r\nCivil_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH SPEED ON THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Scientific American_:\r\n\r\nAlthough not a naval engineer, I wish to reply to some arguments\r\nadvanced by Capt. Giles, and published in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN of\r\nJan. 2, 1886, in regard to high speed on the ocean.\r\n\r\nCapt. Giles argues that because quadrupeds and birds do not in\r\npropelling themselves exert their force in a direct line with the plane\r\nof their motion, but at an angle to it, the same principle would, if\r\napplied to a steamship, increase its speed. But let us look at the\r\nsubject from another standpoint. The quadruped has to support the weight\r\nof his body, and propel himself forward, with the same force. If the\r\nforce be applied perpendicularly, the body is elevated, but not moved\r\nforward. If the force is applied horizontally, the body moves forward,\r\nbut soon falls to the ground, because it is not supported. But when the\r\nforce is applied at the proper angle, the body is moved forward and at\r\nthe same time supported. Directly contrary to Capt. Giles' theory, the\r\ngreater the speed of the quadruped, the nearer in a direct line with his\r\nmotion does he apply the propulsive force, and _vice versa_. This may\r\neasily be seen by any one watching the motions of the horse, hound,\r\ndeer, rabbit, etc., when in rapid motion. The water birds and animals,\r\nwhose weight is supported by the water, do not exert the propulsive\r\nforce in a downward direction, but in a direct line with the plane of\r\ntheir motion. The man who swims does not increase his motion by kicking\r\nout at an angle, but by drawing the feet together with the legs\r\nstraight, thus using the water between them as a double inclined plane,\r\non which his feet and legs slide and thus increase his motion. The\r\nweight of the steamship is already supported by the water, and all that\r\nis required of the propeller is to push her forward. If set so as to act\r\nin a direct line with the plane of motion, it will use all its force to\r\npush her forward; if set so as to use its force in a perpendicular\r\ndirection, it will use all its force to raise her out of the water. If\r\nplaced at an angle of 45° with the plane of motion, half the force will\r\nbe used in raising the ship out of the water, and only half will be left\r\nto push her forward.\r\n\r\nENOS M.

T. PORTER.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appearing for the first time before this Association, which, as I am\r\ninformed, comprises the faculty and the entire body of students of the\r\nSibley College of Mechanical Engineering and the Mechanic Arts, a\r\nreminiscence of the founder of this College suggests itself to me, in\r\nthe relation of which I beg first to be indulged.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1847-8-9 I lived in Rochester, N.Y., and formed a slight\r\nacquaintance with Mr. Sibley, whose home was then, as it has ever since\r\nbeen, in that city. Nearly twelve years afterward, in the summer of\r\n1861, which will be remembered as the first year of our civil war, I met\r\nMr. Sibley again. We happened to occupy a seat together in a car from\r\nNew York to Albany. He recollected me, and we had a conversation which\r\nmade a lasting impression on my memory. I said we had a conversation.\r\nThat reminds me of a story told by my dear friend, of precious memory,\r\nAlexander L. Holley. One summer Mr. Holley accompanied a party of\r\nartists on an excursion to Mt. Katahdin, which, as you know, rises in\r\nalmost solitary grandeur amid the forests and lakes of Maine. He wrote,\r\nin his inimitably happy style, an account of this excursion, which\r\nappeared some time after in _Scribner's Monthly_, elegantly illustrated\r\nwith views of the scenery. Among other things, Mr. Holley related how he\r\nand Mr. Church painted the sketches for a grand picture of Mt. Katahdin.\r\n\"That is,\" he explained, \"Mr. Church painted, and I held the umbrella.\"\r\n\r\nThis describes the conversation which Mr. Sibley and I had. Mr. Sibley\r\ntalked, and I listened. He was a good talker, and I flatter myself that\r\nI rather excel as a listener. On that occasion I did my best, for I knew\r\nwhom I was listening to. I was listening to the man who combined bold\r\nand comprehensive grasp of thought, unerring foresight and sagacity, and\r\nenergy of action and power of accomplishment, in a degree not surpassed,\r\nif it was equaled, among men.\r\n\r\nSome years before, Mr. Sibley had created the Western Union Telegraph\r\nCompany. At that time telegraphy was in a very depressed state. The\r\ncountry was to a considerable extent occupied by local lines, chartered\r\nunder various State laws, and operated without concert. Four rival\r\ncompanies, organized under the Morse, the Bain, the House, and the\r\nHughes patents, competed for the business. Telegraph stock was nearly\r\nvalueless. Hiram Sibley, a man of the people, a resident of an inland\r\ncity, of only moderate fortune, alone grasped the situation. He saw that\r\nthe nature of the business, and the demands of the country, alike\r\nrequired that a single organization, in which all interests should be\r\ncombined, should cover the entire land with its network, by means of\r\nwhich every center and every outlying point, distant as well as near,\r\ncould communicate with each other directly, and that such an\r\norganization must be financially successful. He saw all this vividly,\r\nand realized it with the most intense earnestness of conviction. With\r\nMr. Sibley, to be convinced was to act; and so he set about the task of\r\ncarrying this vast scheme into execution. The result is well known. By\r\nhis immense energy, the magnetic power with which he infused his own\r\nconvictions into other minds, the direct, practical way in which he set\r\nabout the work, and his indomitable perseverance, Mr. Sibley attained at\r\nlast a phenomenal success.\r\n\r\nBut he was not then telling me anything about this. He was telling me of\r\nthe construction of the telegraph line to the Pacific Coast. Here again\r\nMr. Sibley had seen that which was hidden from others. This case\r\ndiffered from the former one in two important respects. Then Mr. Sibley\r\nhad been dependent on the aid and co-operation of many persons; and this\r\nhe had been able to secure. Now, he could not obtain help from a human\r\nbeing; but he had become able to act independently of any assistance.\r\n\r\nHe had made a careful study of the subject, in his thoroughly practical\r\nway, and had become convinced that such a line was feasible, and would\r\nbe remunerative. At his instance a convention of telegraph men met in\r\nthe city of New York, to consider the project. The feeling in this\r\nconvention was extremely unfavorable to it. A committee reported against\r\nit unanimously, on three grounds--the country was destitute of timber,\r\nthe line would be destroyed by the Indians, and if constructed and\r\nmaintained, it would not pay expenses. Mr. Sibley found himself alone.\r\nAn earnest appeal which he made from the report of the committee was\r\nreceived with derisive laughter. The idea of running a telegraph line\r\nthrough what was then a wilderness, roamed over for between one and two\r\nthousand miles of its breadth by bands of savages, who of course would\r\ndestroy the line as soon as it was put up, and where repairs would be\r\ndifficult and useless, even if the other objections to it were out of\r\nthe way, struck the members of the convention as so exquisitely\r\nludicrous that it seemed as if they would never be done laughing about\r\nit. If Mr. Sibley had advocated a line to the moon, they would hardly\r\nhave seen in it greater evidence of lunacy. When he could be heard, he\r\nrose again and said: \"Gentlemen, you may laugh, but if I was not so old,\r\nI would build the line myself.\" Upon this, of course, they laughed\r\nlouder than ever. As they laughed, he grew mad, and shouted: \"Gentlemen,\r\nI will bar the years, and do it.\" And he did it. Without help from any\r\none, for every man who claimed a right to express an opinion upon it\r\nscouted the project as chimerical, and no capitalist would put a dollar\r\nin it, Hiram Sibley built the line of telegraph to San Francisco,\r\nrisking in it all he had in the world. He set about the work with his\r\ncustomary energy, all obstacles vanished, and the line was completed in\r\nan incredibly short time. And from the day it was opened, it has proved\r\nprobably the most profitable line of telegraph that has ever been\r\nconstructed. There was the practicability, and there was the demand and\r\nthe business to be done, and yet no living man could see it, or could be\r\nmade to see it, except Hiram Sibley. \"And to-day,\" he said, with honest\r\npride, \"to-day in New York, men to whom I went almost on my knees for\r\nhelp in building this line, and who would not give me a dollar, have\r\nsolicited me to be allowed to buy stock in it at the rate of five\r\ndollars for one.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about the Indians?\" I asked. \"Why,\" he replied, \"we never had\r\nany trouble from the Indians. I knew we wouldn't have. Men who supposed\r\nI was such a fool as to go about this undertaking before that was all\r\nsettled didn't know me. No Indian ever harmed that line. The Indians are\r\nthe best friends we have got. You see, we taught the Indians the Great\r\nSpirit was in that line; and what was more, we proved it to them. It\r\nwas, by all odds, the greatest medicine they ever saw. They fairly\r\nworshiped it. No Indian ever dared to do it harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he added, \"there was one thing I didn't count on. The border\r\nruffians in Missouri are as bad as anybody ever feared the Indians might\r\nbe. They have given us so much trouble that we are now building a line\r\naround that State, through Iowa and Nebraska. We are obliged to do it.\"\r\n\r\nThis opened another phase of the subject. The telegraph line to the\r\nPacific had a value beyond that which could be expressed in money. It\r\nwas perhaps the strongest of all the ties which bound California so\r\nsecurely to the Union, in the dark days of its struggle for existence.\r\nThe secession element in Missouri recognized the importance of the line\r\nin this respect, and were persistent in their efforts to destroy it. We\r\nhave seen by what means their purpose was thwarted.\r\n\r\nI have always felt that, among the countless evidences of the ordering\r\nof Providence by which the war for the preservation of the Union was\r\nsignalized, not the least striking was the raising up of this remarkable\r\nman, to accomplish alone, and in the very nick of time, a work which at\r\nonce became of such national importance.\r\n\r\nThis is the man who has crowned his useful career, and shown again his\r\neminently practical character and wise foresight, by the endowment of\r\nthis College, which cannot fail to be a perennial source of benefit to\r\nthe country whose interests he has done so much to promote, and which\r\nhis remarkable sagacity and energy contributed so much to preserve.\r\n\r\nWe have an excellent rule, followed by all successful designers of\r\nmachinery, which is, to make provision for the extreme case, for the\r\nmost severe test to which, under normal conditions, and so far as\r\npracticable under abnormal conditions also, the machinery can be\r\nsubjected. Then, of course, any demands upon it which are less than the\r\nextreme demand are not likely to give trouble. I shall apply this\r\nprinciple in addressing you to-day. In what I have to say, I shall speak\r\ndirectly to the youngest and least advanced minds among my auditors. If\r\nI am successful in making an exposition of my subject which shall be\r\nplain to them, then it is evident that I need not concern myself about\r\nbeing understood by the higher class men and the professors.\r\n\r\nThe subject to which your attention is now invited is\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BALANCING FORCES DEVELOPED IN MOVING\r\nBODIES.\r\n\r\nThis is a subject with which every one who expects to be concerned with\r\nmachinery, either as designer or constructor, ought to be familiar. The\r\nprinciples which underlie it are very simple, but in order to be of use,\r\nthese need to be thoroughly understood. If they have once been mastered,\r\nmade familiar, incorporated into your intellectual being, so as to be\r\nreadily and naturally applied to every case as it arises, then you\r\noccupy a high vantage ground. In this particular, at least, you will not\r\ngo about your work uncertainly, trying first this method and then that\r\none, or leaving errors to be disclosed when too late to remedy them. On\r\nthe contrary, you will make, first your calculations and then your\r\nplans, with the certainty that the result will be precisely what you\r\nintend.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when you read discussions on any branch of this subject, you\r\nwill not receive these into unprepared minds, just as apt to admit error\r\nas truth, and possessing no test by which to distinguish the one from\r\nthe other; but you will be able to form intelligent judgments with\r\nrespect to them. You will discover at once whether or not the writers\r\nare anchored to the sure holding ground of sound principles.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that I do not speak of balancing bodies, but of\r\nbalancing forces. Forces are the realities with which, as mechanical\r\nengineers, you will have directly to deal, all through your lives. The\r\npresent discussion is limited also to those forces which are developed\r\nin moving bodies, or by the motion of bodies. This limitation excludes\r\nthe force of gravity, which acts on all bodies alike, whether at rest or\r\nin motion. It is, indeed, often desirable to neutralize the effect of\r\ngravity on machinery. The methods of doing this are, however, obvious,\r\nand I shall not further refer to them.\r\n\r\nTwo very different forces, or manifestations of force, are developed by\r\nthe motion of bodies. These are\r\n\r\n\r\nMOMENTUM AND CENTRIFUGAL FORCE.\r\n\r\nThe first of these forces is exerted by every moving body, whatever the\r\nnature of the path in which it is moving, and always in the direction of\r\nits motion. The latter force is exerted only by bodies whose path is a\r\ncircle, or a curve of some form, about a central body or point, to which\r\nit is held, and this force is always at right angles with the direction\r\nof motion of the body.\r\n\r\nRespecting momentum, I wish only to call your attention to a single\r\nfact, which will become of importance in the course of our discussion.\r\nExperiments on falling bodies, as well as all experience, show that the\r\nvelocity of every moving body is the product of two factors, which must\r\ncombine to produce it. Those factors are force and distance. In order to\r\nimpart motion to the body, force must act through distance. These two\r\nfactors may be combined in any proportions whatever. The velocity\r\nimparted to the body will vary as the square root of their product.\r\nThus, in the case of any given body,\r\n\r\n  Let force 1, acting through distance 1,  impart velocity 1.\r\n  Then  \"   1,   \"        \"      \"     4, will \"     \"     2, or\r\n        \"   2,   \"        \"      \"     2,  \"   \"     \"     2, or\r\n        \"   4,   \"        \"      \"     1,  \"   \"     \"     2;\r\n  And   \"   1,   \"        \"      \"     9,  \"   \"     \"     3, or\r\n        \"   3,   \"        \"      \"     3,  \"   \"     \"     3, or\r\n        \"   9,   \"        \"      \"     1,  \"   \"     \"     3.\r\n\r\nThis table might be continued indefinitely. The product of the force\r\ninto the distance will always vary as the square of the final velocity\r\nimparted. To arrest a given velocity, the same force, acting through the\r\nsame distance, or the same product of force into distance, is required\r\nthat was required to impart the velocity.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental truth which I now wish to impress upon your minds is\r\nthat in order to impart velocity to a body, to develop the energy which\r\nis possessed by a body in motion, force must act through distance.\r\nDistance is a factor as essential as force. Infinite force could not\r\nimpart to a body the least velocity, could not develop the least energy,\r\nwithout acting through distance.\r\n\r\nThis exposition of the nature of momentum is sufficient for my present\r\npurpose. I shall have occasion to apply it later on, and to describe the\r\nmethods of balancing this force, in those cases in which it becomes\r\nnecessary or desirable to do so. At present I will proceed to consider\r\nthe second of the forces, or manifestations of force, which are\r\ndeveloped in moving bodies--_centrifugal force_.\r\n\r\nThis force presents its claims to attention in all bodies which revolve\r\nabout fixed centers, and sometimes these claims are presented with a\r\ngood deal of urgency. At the same time, there is probably no subject,\r\nabout which the ideas of men generally are more vague and confused. This\r\nconfusion is directly due to the vague manner in which the subject of\r\ncentrifugal force is treated, even by our best writers. As would then\r\nnaturally be expected, the definitions of it commonly found in our\r\nhandbooks are generally indefinite, or misleading, or even absolutely\r\nuntrue.\r\n\r\nBefore we can intelligently consider the principles and methods of\r\nbalancing this force, we must get a correct conception of the nature of\r\nthe force itself. What, then, is centrifugal force? It is an extremely\r\nsimple thing; a very ordinary amount of mechanical intelligence is\r\nsufficient to enable one to form a correct and clear idea of it. This\r\nfact renders it all the more surprising that such inaccurate and\r\nconfused language should be employed in its definition. Respecting\r\nwriters, also, who use language with precision, and who are profound\r\nmasters of this subject, it must be said that, if it had been their\r\npurpose to shroud centrifugal force in mystery, they could hardly have\r\naccomplished this purpose more effectually than they have done, to minds\r\nby whom it was not already well understood.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose a body to be moving in a circular path, around a center\r\nto which it is firmly held; and let us, moreover, suppose the impelling\r\nforce, by which the body was put in motion, to have ceased; and, also,\r\nthat the body encounters no resistance to its motion. It is then, by our\r\nsupposition, moving in its circular path with a uniform velocity,\r\nneither accelerated nor retarded. Under these conditions, what is the\r\nforce which is being exerted on this body? Clearly, there is only one\r\nsuch force, and that is, the force which holds it to the center, and\r\ncompels it, in its uniform motion, to maintain a fixed distance from\r\nthis center. This is what is termed centripetal force. It is obvious,\r\nthat the centripetal force, which holds this revolving body _to_ the\r\ncenter, is the only force which is being exerted upon it.\r\n\r\nWhere, then, is the centrifugal force? Why, the fact is, there is not\r\nany such thing. In the dynamical sense of the term \"force,\" the sense in\r\nwhich this term is always understood in ordinary speech, as something\r\ntending to produce motion, and the direction of which determines the\r\ndirection in which motion of a body must take place, there is, I repeat,\r\nno such thing as centrifugal force.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another sense in which the term \"force\" is employed,\r\nwhich, in distinction from the above, is termed a statical sense. This\r\n\"statical force\" is the force by the exertion of which a body keeps\r\nstill. It is the force of inertia--the resistance which all matter\r\nopposes to a dynamical force exerted to put it in motion. This is the\r\nsense in which the term \"force\" is employed in the expression\r\n\"centrifugal force.\" Is that all? you ask. Yes; that is all.\r\n\r\nI must explain to you how it is that a revolving body exerts this\r\nresistance to being put in motion, when all the while it _is_ in motion,\r\nwith, according to our above supposition, a uniform velocity. The first\r\nlaw of motion, so far as we now have occasion to employ it, is that a\r\nbody, when put in motion, moves in a straight line. This a moving body\r\nalways does, unless it is acted on by some force, other than its\r\nimpelling force, which deflects it, or turns it aside, from its direct\r\nline of motion. A familiar example of this deflecting force is afforded\r\nby the force of gravity, as it acts on a projectile. The projectile,\r\ndischarged at any angle of elevation, would move on in a straight line\r\nforever, but, first, it is constantly retarded by the resistance of the\r\natmosphere, and, second, it is constantly drawn downward, or made to\r\nfall, by the attraction of the earth; and so instead of a straight line\r\nit describes a curve, known as the trajectory.\r\n\r\nNow a revolving body, also, has the same tendency to move in a straight\r\nline. It would do so, if it were not continually deflected from this\r\nline. Another force is constantly exerted upon it, compelling it, at\r\nevery successive point of its path, to leave the direct line of motion,\r\nand move on a line which is everywhere equally distant from the center\r\nto which it is held. If at any point the revolving body could get free,\r\nand sometimes it does get free, it would move straight on, in a line\r\ntangent to the circle at the point of its liberation. But if it cannot\r\nget free, it is compelled to leave each new tangential direction, as\r\nsoon as it has taken it.\r\n\r\nThis is illustrated in the above figure. The body, A, is supposed to be\r\nrevolving in the direction indicated by the arrow, in the circle, A B F\r\nG, around the center, O, to which it is held by the cord, O A. At the\r\npoint, A, it is moving in the tangential direction, A D. It would\r\ncontinue to move in this direction, did not the cord, O A, compel it to\r\nmove in the arc, A C. Should this cord break at the point, A, the body\r\nwould move; straight on toward D, with whatever velocity it had.\r\n\r\nYou perceive now what centrifugal force is. This body is moving in the\r\ndirection, A D. The centripetal force, exerted through the cord, O A,\r\npulls it aside from this direction of motion. The body resists this\r\ndeflection, and this resistance is its centrifugal force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1]\r\n\r\nCentrifugal force is, then, properly defined to be the disposition of a\r\nrevolving body to move in a straight line, and the resistance which such\r\na body opposes to being drawn aside from a straight line of motion. The\r\nforce which draws the revolving body continually to the center, or the\r\ndeflecting force, is called the centripetal force, and, aside from the\r\nimpelling and retarding forces which act in the direction of its motion,\r\nthe centripetal force is, dynamically speaking, the only force which is\r\nexerted on the body.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the resistance of the body furnishes the measure of the\r\ncentripetal force. That is, the centripetal force must be exerted in a\r\ndegree sufficient to overcome this resistance, if the body is to move in\r\nthe circular path. In this respect, however, this case does not differ\r\nfrom every other case of the exertion of force. Force is always exerted\r\nto overcome resistance: otherwise it could not be exerted. And the\r\nresistance always furnishes the exact measure of the force. I wish to\r\nmake it entirely clear, that in the dynamical sense of the term \"force,\"\r\nthere is no such thing as centrifugal force. The dynamical force, that\r\nwhich produces motion, is the centripetal force, drawing the body\r\ncontinually from the tangential direction, toward the center; and what\r\nis termed centrifugal force is merely the resistance which the body\r\nopposes to this deflection, _precisely like any other resistance to a\r\nforce_.\r\n\r\nThe centripetal force is exerted on the radial line, as on the line, A\r\nO, Fig. 1, at right angles with the direction in which the body is\r\nmoving; and draws it directly toward the center. It is, therefore,\r\nnecessary that the resistance to this force shall also be exerted on the\r\nsame line, in the opposite direction, or directly from the center. But\r\nthis resistance has not the least power or tendency to produce motion in\r\nthe direction in which it is exerted, any more than any other resistance\r\nhas.\r\n\r\nWe have been supposing a body to be firmly held to the center, so as to\r\nbe compelled to revolve about it in a fixed path. But the bond which\r\nholds it to the center may be elastic, and in that case, if the\r\ncentrifugal force is sufficient, the body will be drawn from the center,\r\nstretching the elastic bond. It may be asked if this does not show\r\ncentrifugal force to be a force tending to produce motion from the\r\ncenter. This question is answered by describing the action which really\r\ntakes place. The revolving body is now imperfectly deflected. The bond\r\nis not strong enough to compel it to leave its direct line of motion,\r\nand so it advances a certain distance along this tangential line. This\r\nadvance brings the body into a larger circle, and by this enlargement of\r\nthe circle, assuming the rate of revolution to be maintained, its\r\ncentrifugal force is proportionately increased. The deflecting power\r\nexerted by the elastic bond is also increased by its elongation. If this\r\nincrease of deflecting force is no greater than the increase of\r\ncentrifugal force, then the body will continue on in its direct path;\r\nand when the limit of its elasticity is reached, the deflecting bond\r\nwill be broken. If, however, the strength of the deflecting bond is\r\nincreased by its elongation in a more rapid ratio than the centrifugal\r\nforce is increased by the enlargement of the circle, then a point will\r\nbe reached in which the centripetal force will be sufficient to compel\r\nthe body to move again in the circular path.\r\n\r\nSometimes the centripetal force is weak, and opportunity is afforded to\r\nobserve this action, and see its character exhibited. A common example\r\nof weak centripetal force is the adhesion of water to the face of a\r\nrevolving grindstone. Here we see the deflecting force to become\r\ninsufficient to compel the drops of water longer to leave their direct\r\npaths, and so these do not longer leave their direct paths, but move on\r\nin those paths, with the velocity they have at the instant of leaving\r\nthe stone, flying off on tangential lines.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a fluid be poured on the side of the revolving wheel near\r\nthe axis, it will move out to the rim on radial lines, as may be\r\nobserved on car wheels universally. The radial lines of black oil on\r\nthese wheels look very much as if centrifugal force actually did produce\r\nmotion, or had at least a very decided tendency to produce motion, in\r\nthe radial direction. This interesting action calls for explanation. In\r\nthis action the oil moves outward gradually, or by inconceivably minute\r\nsteps. Its adhesion being overcome in the least possible degree, it\r\nmoves in the same degree tangentially. In so doing it comes in contact\r\nwith a point of the surface which has a motion more rapid than its own.\r\nIts inertia has now to be overcome, in the same degree in which it had\r\novercome the adhesion. Motion in the radial direction is the result of\r\nthese two actions, namely, leaving the first point of contact\r\ntangentially and receiving an acceleration of its motion, so that this\r\nshall be equal to that of the second point of contact. When we think\r\nabout the matter a little closely, we see that at the rim of the wheel\r\nthe oil has perhaps ten times the velocity of revolution which it had on\r\nleaving the journal, and that the mystery to be explained really is, How\r\ndid it get that velocity, moving out on a radial line? Why was it not\r\nleft behind at the very first? Solely by reason of its forward\r\ntangential motion. That is the answer.\r\n\r\nWhen writers who understand the subject talk about the centripetal and\r\ncentrifugal forces being different names for the same force, and about\r\nequal action and reaction, and employ other confusing expressions, just\r\nremember that all they really mean is to express the universal relation\r\nbetween force and resistance. The expression \"centrifugal force\" is\r\nitself so misleading, that it becomes especially important that the real\r\nnature of this so-called force, or the sense in which the term \"force\"\r\nis used in this expression, should be fully explained.[1] This force is\r\nnow seen to be merely the tendency of a revolving body to move in a\r\nstraight line, and the resistance which it opposes to being drawn aside\r\nfrom that line. Simple enough! But when we come to consider this action\r\ncarefully, it is wonderful how much we find to be contained in what\r\nappears so simple. Let us see.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I was led to study this subject in looking to see what had\r\nbecome of my first permanent investment, a small venture, made about\r\nthirty-five years ago, in the \"Sawyer and Gwynne static pressure\r\nengine.\" This was the high-sounding name of the Keely motor of that day,\r\nan imposition made possible by the confused ideas prevalent on this very\r\nsubject of centrifugal force.]\r\n\r\nFIRST.--I have called your attention to the fact that the direction in\r\nwhich the revolving body is deflected from the tangential line of motion\r\nis toward the center, on the radial line, which forms a right angle with\r\nthe tangent on which the body is moving. The first question that\r\npresents itself is this: What is the measure or amount of this\r\ndeflection? The answer is, this measure or amount is the versed sine of\r\nthe angle through which the body moves.\r\n\r\nNow, I suspect that some of you--some of those whom I am directly\r\naddressing--may not know what the versed sine of an angle is; so I must\r\ntell you. We will refer again to Fig. 1. In this figure, O A is one\r\nradius of the circle in which the body A is revolving. O C is another\r\nradius of this circle. These two radii include between them the angle A\r\nO C. This angle is subtended by the arc A C. If from the point O we let\r\nfall the line C E perpendicular to the radius O A, this line will divide\r\nthe radius O A into two parts, O E and E A. Now we have the three\r\ninterior lines, or the three lines within the circle, which are\r\nfundamental in trigonometry. C E is the sine, O E is the cosine, and E A\r\nis the versed sine of the angle A O C. Respecting these three lines\r\nthere are many things to be observed. I will call your attention to the\r\nfollowing only:\r\n\r\n_First_.--Their length is always less than the radius. The radius is\r\nexpressed by 1, or unity. So, these lines being less than unity, their\r\nlength is always expressed by decimals, which mean equal to such a\r\nproportion of the radius.\r\n\r\n_Second_.--The cosine and the versed sine are together equal to the\r\nradius, so that the versed sine is always 1, less the cosine.\r\n\r\n_Third_.--If I diminish the angle A O C, by moving the radius O C toward\r\nO A, the sine C E diminishes rapidly, and the versed sine E A also\r\ndiminishes, but more slowly, while the cosine O E increases. This you\r\nwill see represented in the smaller angles shown in Fig. 2. If, finally,\r\nI make O C to coincide with O A, the angle is obliterated, the sine and\r\nthe versed sine have both disappeared, and the cosine has become the\r\nradius.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_.--If, on the contrary, I enlarge the angle A O C by moving the\r\nradius O C toward O B, then the sine and the versed sine both increase,\r\nand the cosine diminishes; and if, finally, I make O C coincide with O\r\nB, then the cosine has disappeared, the sine has become the radius O B,\r\nand the versed sine has become the radius O A, thus forming the two\r\nsides inclosing the right angle A O B. The study of this explanation\r\nwill make you familiar with these important lines. The sine and the\r\ncosine I shall have occasion to employ in the latter part of my lecture.\r\nNow you know what the versed sine of an angle is, and are able to\r\nobserve in Fig. 1 that the versed sine A E, of the angle A O C,\r\nrepresents in a general way the distance that the body A will be\r\ndeflected from the tangent A D toward the center O while describing the\r\narc A C.\r\n\r\nThe same law of deflection is shown, in smaller angles, in Fig. 2. In\r\nthis figure, also, you observe in each of the angles A O B and A O C\r\nthat the deflection, from the tangential direction toward the center, of\r\na body moving in the arc A C is represented by the versed sine of the\r\nangle. The tangent to the arc at A, from which this deflection is\r\nmeasured, is omitted in this figure to avoid confusion. It is shown\r\nsufficiently in Fig. 1. The angles in Fig. 2 are still pretty large\r\nangles, being 12° and 24° respectively. These large angles are used for\r\nconvenience of illustration; but it should be explained that this law\r\ndoes not really hold in them, as is evident, because the arc is longer\r\nthan the tangent to which it would be connected by a line parallel with\r\nthe versed sine. The law is absolutely true only when the tangent and\r\narc coincide, and approximately so for exceedingly small angles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nIn reality, however, we have only to do with the case in which the arc\r\nand the tangent do coincide, and in which the law that the deflection is\r\n_equal to_ the versed sine of the angle is absolutely true. Here, in\r\nobserving this most familiar thing, we are, at a single step, taken to\r\nthat which is utterly beyond our comprehension. The angles we have to\r\nconsider disappear, not only from our sight, but even from our\r\nconception. As in every other case when we push a physical investigation\r\nto its limit, so here also, we find our power of thought transcended,\r\nand ourselves in the presence of the infinite.\r\n\r\nWe can discuss very small angles. We talk familiarly about the angle\r\nwhich is subtended by 1\" of arc. On Fig. 2, a short line is drawn near\r\nto the radius O A'. The distance between O A' and this short line is 1°\r\nof the arc A' B'. If we divide this distance by 3,600, we get 1\" of arc.\r\nThe upper line of the Table of versed sines given below is the versed\r\nsine of 1\" of arc. It takes 1,296,000 of these angles to fill a circular\r\nspace. These are a great many angles, but they do not make a circle.\r\nThey make a polygon. If the radius of the circumscribed circle of this\r\npolygon is 1,296,000 feet, which is nearly 213 geographical miles, each\r\none of its sides will be a straight line, 6.283 feet long. On the\r\nsurface of the earth, at the equator, each side of this polygon would be\r\none-sixtieth of a geographical mile, or 101.46 feet. On the orbit of the\r\nmoon, at its mean distance from the earth, each of these straight sides\r\nwould be about 6,000 feet long.\r\n\r\nThe best we are able to do is to conceive of a polygon having an\r\ninfinite number of sides, and so an infinite number of angles, the\r\nversed sines of which are infinitely small, and having, also, an\r\ninfinite number of tangential directions, in which the body can\r\nsuccessively move. Still, we have not reached the circle. We never can\r\nreach the circle. When you swing a sling around your head, and feel the\r\nuniform stress exerted on your hand through the cord, you are made aware\r\nof an action which is entirely beyond the grasp of our minds and the\r\nreach of our analysis.\r\n\r\nSo always in practical operation that law is absolutely true which we\r\nobserve to be approximated to more and more nearly as we consider\r\nsmaller and smaller angles, that the versed sine of the angle is the\r\nmeasure of its deflection from the straight line of motion, or the\r\nmeasure of its fall toward the center, which takes place at every point\r\nin the motion of a revolving body.\r\n\r\nThen, assuming the absolute truth of this law of deflection, we find\r\nourselves able to explain all the phenomena of centrifugal force, and to\r\ncompute its amount correctly in all cases.\r\n\r\nWe have now advanced two steps. We have learned _the direction_ and _the\r\nmeasure_ of the deflection, which a revolving body continually suffers,\r\nand its resistance to which is termed centrifugal force. The direction\r\nis toward the center, and the measure is the versed sine of the angle.\r\n\r\nSECOND.--We next come to consider what are known as the laws of\r\ncentrifugal force. These laws are four in number. They are, that the\r\namount of centrifugal force exerted by a revolving body varies in four\r\nways.\r\n\r\n_First_.--Directly as the weight of the body.\r\n\r\n_Second_.--In a given circle of revolution, as the square of the speed\r\nor of the number of revolutions per minute; which two expressions in\r\nthis case mean the same thing.\r\n\r\n_Third_.--With a given number of revolutions per minute, or a given\r\nangular velocity[1] _directly_ as the radius of the circle; and\r\n\r\n_Fourth_.--With a given actual velocity, or speed in feet per minute,\r\n_inversely_ as the radius of the circle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A revolving body is said to have the same angular velocity,\r\nwhen it sweeps through equal angles in equal times. Its actual velocity\r\nvaries directly as the radius of the circle in which it is revolving.]\r\n\r\nOf course there is a reason for these laws. You are not to learn them by\r\nrote, or to accept them on any authority. You are taught not to accept\r\nany rule or formula on authority, but to demand the reason for it--to\r\ngive yourselves no rest until you know the why and wherefore, and\r\ncomprehend these fully. This is education, not cramming the mind with\r\nmere facts and rules to be memorized, but drawing out the mental powers\r\ninto activity, strengthening them by use and exercise, and forming the\r\nhabit, and at the same time developing the power, of penetrating to the\r\nreason of things.\r\n\r\nIn this way only, you will be able to meet the requirement of a great\r\neducator, who said: \"I do not care to be told what a young man knows,\r\nbut what he can _do_.\" I wish here to add my grain to the weight of\r\ninstruction which you receive, line upon line, precept on precept, on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nThe reason for these laws of centrifugal force is an extremely simple\r\none. The first law, that this force varies directly as the weight of the\r\nbody, is of course obvious. We need not refer to this law any further.\r\nThe second, third, and fourth laws merely express the relative rates at\r\nwhich a revolving body is deflected from the tangential direction of\r\nmotion, in each of the three cases described, and which cases embrace\r\nall possible conditions.\r\n\r\nThese three rates of deflection are exhibited in Fig. 2. An examination\r\nof this figure will give you a clear understanding of them. Let us first\r\nsuppose a body to be revolving about the point, O, as a center, in a\r\ncircle of which A B C is an arc, and with a velocity which will carry it\r\nfrom A to B in one second of time. Then in this time the body is\r\ndeflected from the tangential direction a distance equal to A D, the\r\nversed sine of the angle A O B. Now let us suppose the velocity of this\r\nbody to be doubled in the same circle. In one second of time it moves\r\nfrom A to C, and is deflected from the tangential direction of motion a\r\ndistance equal to A E, the versed sine of the angle, A O C. But A E is\r\nfour times A D. Here we see in a given circle of revolution the\r\ndeflection varying as the square of the speed. The slight error already\r\npointed out in these large angles is disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe following table will show, by comparison of the versed sines of very\r\nsmall angles, the deflection in a given circle varying as the square of\r\nthe speed, when we penetrate to them, so nearly that the error is not\r\ndisclosed at the fifteenth place of decimals.\r\n\r\n  The versed sine of   1\" is 0.000,000,000,011,752\r\n   \"   \"      \"   \"    2\" is 0.000,000,000,047,008\r\n   \"   \"      \"   \"    3\" is 0.000,000,000,105,768\r\n   \"   \"      \"   \"    4\" is 0.000,000,000,188,032\r\n   \"   \"      \"   \"    5\" is 0.000,000,000,293,805\r\n   \"   \"      \"   \"    6\" is 0.000,000,000,423,072\r\n   \"   \"      \"   \"    7\" is 0.000,000,000,575,848\r\n   \"   \"      \"   \"    8\" is 0.000,000,000,752,128\r\n   \"   \"      \"   \"    9\" is 0.000,000,000,951,912\r\n   \"   \"      \"   \"   10\" is 0.000,000,001,175,222\r\n   \"   \"      \"   \"  100\" is 0.000,000,117,522,250\r\n\r\nYou observe the deflection for 10\" of arc is 100 times as great, and for\r\n100\" of arc is 10,000 times as great as it is for 1\" of arc. So far as\r\nis shown by the 15th place of decimals, the versed sine varies as the\r\nsquare of the angle; or, in a given circle, the deflection, and so the\r\ncentrifugal force, of a revolving body varies as the square of the\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the third law is equally apparent on inspection of Fig.\r\n2. It is obvious, that in the case of bodies making the same number of\r\nrevolutions in different circles, the deflection must vary directly as\r\nthe diameter of the circle, because for any given angle the versed sine\r\nvaries directly as the radius. Thus radius O A' is twice radius O A, and\r\nso the versed sine of the arc A' B' is twice the versed sine of the arc\r\nA B. Here, while the angular velocity is the same, the actual velocity\r\nis doubled by increase in the diameter of the circle, and so the\r\ndeflection is doubled. This exhibits the general law, that with a given\r\nangular velocity the centrifugal force varies directly as the radius or\r\ndiameter of the circle.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the reason for the fourth law, that, with a given actual\r\nvelocity, the centrifugal force varies _inversely_ as the diameter of\r\nthe circle. If any of you ever revolved a weight at the end of a cord\r\nwith some velocity, and let the cord wind up, suppose around your hand,\r\nwithout doing anything to accelerate the motion, then, while the circle\r\nof revolution was growing smaller, the actual velocity continuing nearly\r\nuniform, you have felt the continually increasing stress, and have\r\nobserved the increasing angular velocity, the two obviously increasing\r\nin the same ratio. That is the operation or action which the fourth law\r\nof centrifugal force expresses. An examination of this same figure (Fig.\r\n2) will show you at once the reason for it in the increasing deflection\r\nwhich the body suffers, as its circle of revolution is contracted. If we\r\ntake the velocity A' B', double the velocity A B, and transfer it to the\r\nsmaller circle, we have the velocity A C. But the deflection has been\r\nincreasing as we have reduced the circle, and now with one half the\r\nradius it is twice as great. It has increased in the same ratio in which\r\nthe angular velocity has increased. Thus we see the simple and necessary\r\nnature of these laws. They merely express the different rates of\r\ndeflection of a revolving body in these different cases.\r\n\r\nTHIRD.--We have a coefficient of centrifugal force, by which we are\r\nenabled to compute the amount of this resistance of a revolving body to\r\ndeflection from a direct line of motion in all cases. This is that\r\ncoefficient. The centrifugal force of a body making _one_ revolution per\r\nminute, in a circle of _one_ foot radius, is 0.000341 of the weight of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nAccording to the above laws, we have only to multiply this coefficient\r\nby the square of the number of revolutions made by the body per minute,\r\nand this product by the radius of the circle in feet, or in decimals of\r\na foot, and we have the centrifugal force, in terms of the weight of the\r\nbody. Multiplying this by the weight of the body in pounds, we have the\r\ncentrifugal force in pounds.\r\n\r\nOf course you want to know how this coefficient has been found out, and\r\nhow you can be sure it is correct. I will tell you a very simple way.\r\nThere are also mathematical methods of ascertaining this coefficient,\r\nwhich your professors, if you ask them, will let you dig out for\r\nyourselves. The way I am going to tell you I found out for myself, and\r\nthat, I assure you, is the only way to learn anything, so that it will\r\nstick; and the more trouble the search gives you, the darker the way\r\nseems, and the greater the degree of perseverance that is demanded, the\r\nmore you will appreciate the truth when you have found it, and the more\r\ncomplete and permanent your possession of it will be.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this method may be a little more abstruse than the\r\nexplanations already given, but it is very simple and elegant when you\r\nsee it, and I fancy I can make it quite clear. I shall have to preface\r\nit by the explanation of two simple laws. The first of these is, that a\r\nbody acted on by a constant force, so as to have its motion uniformly\r\naccelerated, suppose in a straight line, moves through distances which\r\nincrease as the square of the time that the accelerating force continues\r\nto be exerted.\r\n\r\nThe necessary nature of this law, or rather the action of which this law\r\nis the expression, is shown in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nLet the distances A B, B C, C D, and D E in this figure represent four\r\nsuccessive seconds of time. They may just as well be conceived to\r\nrepresent any other equal units, however small. Seconds are taken only\r\nfor convenience. At the commencement of the first second, let a body\r\nstart from a state of rest at A, under the action of a constant force,\r\nsufficient to move it in one second through a distance of one foot. This\r\ndistance also is taken only for convenience. At the end of this second,\r\nthe body will have acquired a velocity of two feet per second. This is\r\nobvious because, in order to move through one foot in this second, the\r\nbody must have had during the second an average velocity of one foot per\r\nsecond. But at the commencement of the second it had no velocity. Its\r\nmotion increased uniformly. Therefore, at the termination of the second\r\nits velocity must have reached two feet per second. Let the triangle A B\r\nF represent this accelerated motion, and the distance, of one foot,\r\nmoved through during the first second, and let the line B F represent\r\nthe velocity of two feet per second, acquired by the body at the end of\r\nit. Now let us imagine the action of the accelerating force suddenly to\r\ncease, and the body to move on merely with the velocity it has acquired.\r\nDuring the next second it will move through two feet, as represented by\r\nthe square B F C I. But in fact, the action of the accelerating force\r\ndoes not cease. This force continues to be exerted, and produces on the\r\nbody during the next second the same effect that it did during the first\r\nsecond, causing it to move through an additional foot of distance,\r\nrepresented by the triangle F I G, and to have its velocity accelerated\r\ntwo additional feet per second, as represented by the line I G. So in\r\ntwo seconds the body has moved through four feet. We may follow the\r\noperation of this law as far as we choose. The figure shows it during\r\nfour seconds, or any other unit, of time, and also for any unit of\r\ndistance. Thus:\r\n\r\n  Time 1           Distance 1\r\n    \"  2               \"    4\r\n    \"  3               \"    9\r\n    \"  4               \"   16\r\n\r\nSo it is obvious that the distance moved through by a body whose motion\r\nis uniformly accelerated increases as the square of the time.\r\n\r\nBut, you are asking, what has all this to do with a revolving body? As\r\nsoon as your minds can be started from a state of rest, you will\r\nperceive that it has everything to do with a revolving body. The\r\ncentripetal force, which acts upon a revolving body to draw it to the\r\ncenter, is a constant force, and under it the revolving body must move\r\nor be deflected through distances which increase as the squares of the\r\ntimes, just as any body must do when acted on by a constant force. To\r\nprove that a revolving body obeys this law, I have only to draw your\r\nattention to Fig. 2. Let the equal arcs, A B and B C, in this figure\r\nrepresent now equal times, as they will do in case of a body revolving\r\nin this circle with a uniform velocity. The versed sines of the angles,\r\nA O B and A O C, show that in the time, A C, the revolving body was\r\ndeflected four times as far from the tangent to the circle at A as it\r\nwas in the time, A B. So the deflection increased as the square of the\r\ntime. If on the table already given, we take the seconds of arc to\r\nrepresent equal times, we see the versed sine, or the amount of\r\ndeflection of a revolving body, to increase, in these minute angles,\r\nabsolutely so far as appears up to the fifteenth place of decimals, as\r\nthe square of the time.\r\n\r\nThe standard from which all computations are made of the distances\r\npassed through in given times by bodies whose motion is uniformly\r\naccelerated, and from which the velocity acquired is computed when the\r\naccelerating force is known, and the force is found when the velocity\r\nacquired or the rate of acceleration is known, is the velocity of a body\r\nfalling to the earth. It has been established by experiment, that in\r\nthis latitude near the level of the sea, a falling body in one second\r\nfalls through a distance of 16.083 feet, and acquires a velocity of\r\n32.166 feet per second; or, rather, that it would do so if it did not\r\nmeet the resistance of the atmosphere. In the case of a falling body,\r\nits weight furnishes, first, the inertia, or the resistance to motion,\r\nthat has to be overcome, and affords the measure of this resistance,\r\nand, second, it furnishes the measure of the attraction of the earth, or\r\nthe force exerted to overcome its resistance. Here, as in all possible\r\ncases, the force and the resistance are identical with each other. The\r\nabove is, therefore, found in this way to be the rate at which the\r\nmotion of any body will be accelerated when it is acted on by a constant\r\nforce equal to its weight, and encounters no resistance.\r\n\r\nIt follows that a revolving body, when moving uniformly in any circle at\r\na speed at which its deflection from a straight line of motion is such\r\nthat in one second this would amount to 16.083 feet, requires the\r\nexertion of a centripetal force equal to its weight to produce such\r\ndeflection. The deflection varying as the square of the time, in 0.01 of\r\na second this deflection will be through a distance of 0.0016083 of a\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nNow, at what speed must a body revolve, in a circle of one foot radius,\r\nin order that in 0.01 of one second of time its deflection from a\r\ntangential direction shall be 0.0016083 of a foot? This decimal is the\r\nversed sine of the arc of 3°15', or of 3.25°. This angle is so small\r\nthat the departure from the law that the deflection is equal to the\r\nversed sine of the angle is too slight to appear in our computation.\r\nTherefore, the arc of 3.25° is the arc of a circle of one foot radius\r\nthrough which a body must revolve in 0.01 of a second of time, in order\r\nthat the centripetal force, and so the centrifugal force, shall be equal\r\nto its weight. At this rate of revolution, in one second the body will\r\nrevolve through 325°, which is at the rate of 54.166 revolutions per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nNow there remains only one question more to be answered. If at 54.166\r\nrevolutions per minute the centrifugal force of a body is equal to its\r\nweight, what will its centrifugal force be at one revolution per minute\r\nin the same circle?\r\n\r\nTo answer this question we have to employ the other extremely simple\r\nlaw, which I said I must explain to you. It is this: The acceleration\r\nand the force vary in a constant ratio with each other. Thus, let force\r\n1 produce acceleration 1, then force 1 applied again will produce\r\nacceleration 1 again, or, in other words, force 2 will produce\r\nacceleration 2, and so on. This being so, and the amount of the\r\ndeflection varying as the squares of the speeds in the two cases, the\r\ncentrifugal force of a body making one revolution per minute in a circle\r\nof\r\n\r\n                              1²\r\n  one foot radius will be ---------- = 0.000341\r\n                           54.166²\r\n\r\n--the coefficient of centrifugal force.\r\n\r\nThere is another mode of making this computation, which is rather neater\r\nand more expeditious than the above. A body making one revolution per\r\nminute in a circle of one foot radius will in one second revolve through\r\nan arc of 6°. The versed sine of this arc of 6° is 0.0054781046 of a\r\nfoot. This is, therefore, the distance through which a body revolving at\r\nthis rate will be deflected in one second. If it were acted on by a\r\nforce equal to its weight, it would be deflected through the distance of\r\n16.083 feet in the same time. What is the deflecting force actually\r\nexerted upon it? Of\r\n\r\n              0.0054781046\r\ncourse, it is ------------.\r\n                 16.083\r\n\r\nThis division gives 0.000341 of its weight as such deflecting force, the\r\nsame as before.\r\n\r\nIn taking the versed sine of 6°, a minute error is involved, though not\r\none large enough to change the last figure in the above quotient. The\r\nlaw of uniform acceleration does not quite hold when we come to an angle\r\nso large as 6°. If closer accuracy is demanded, we can attain it, by\r\ntaking the versed sine for 1°, and multiplying this by 6². This gives as\r\na product 0.0054829728, which is a little larger than the versed sine of\r\n6°.\r\n\r\nI hope I have now kept my promise, and made it clear how the coefficient\r\nof centrifugal force may be found in this simple way.\r\n\r\nWe have now learned several things about centrifugal force. Let me\r\nrecapitulate. We have learned:\r\n\r\n1st. The real nature of centrifugal force. That in the dynamical sense\r\nof the term force, this is not a force at all: that it is not capable of\r\nproducing motion, that the force which is really exerted on a revolving\r\nbody is the centripetal force, and what we are taught to call\r\ncentrifugal force is nothing but the resistance which a revolving body\r\nopposes to this force, precisely like any other resistance.\r\n\r\n2d. The direction of the deflection, to which the centrifugal force is\r\nthe resistance, which is straight to the center.\r\n\r\n3d. The measure of this deflection; the versed sine of the angle.\r\n\r\n4th. The reason of the laws of centrifugal force; that these laws merely\r\nexpress the relative amount of the deflection, and so the amount of the\r\nforce required to produce the deflection, and of the resistance of the\r\nrevolving body to it, in all different cases.\r\n\r\n5th. That the deflection of a revolving body presents a case analogous\r\nto that of uniformly accelerated motion, under the action of a constant\r\nforce, similar to that which is presented by falling bodies;[1] and\r\nfinally,\r\n\r\n6th. How to find the coefficient, by which the amount of centrifugal\r\nforce exerted in any case may be computed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A body revolving with a uniform velocity in a horizontal\r\nplane would present the only case of uniformly accelerated motion that\r\nis possible to be realized under actual conditions.]\r\n\r\nI now pass to some other features.\r\n\r\n_First_.--You will observe that, relatively to the center, a revolving\r\nbody, at any point in its revolution, is at rest. That is, it has no\r\nmotion, either from or toward the center, except that which is produced\r\nby the action of the centripetal force. It has, therefore, this identity\r\nalso with a falling body, that it starts from a state of rest. This\r\nbrings us to a far more comprehensive definition of centrifugal force.\r\nThis is the resistance which a body opposes to being put in motion, at\r\nany velocity acquired in any time, from a state of rest. Thus\r\ncentrifugal force reveals to us the measure of the inertia of matter.\r\nThis inertia may be demonstrated and exhibited by means of apparatus\r\nconstructed on this principle quite as accurately as it can be in any\r\nother way.\r\n\r\n_Second_.--You will also observe the fact, that motion must be imparted\r\nto a body gradually. As distance, _through_ which force can act, is\r\nnecessary to the impartation of velocity, so also time, _during_ which\r\nforce can act, is necessary to the same result. We do not know how\r\nmotion from a state of rest begins, any more than we know how a polygon\r\nbecomes a circle. But we do know that infinite force cannot impart\r\nabsolutely instantaneous motion to even the smallest body, or to a body\r\ncapable of opposing the least resistance. Time being an essential\r\nelement or factor in the impartation of velocity, if this factor be\r\nomitted, the least resistance becomes infinite.\r\n\r\nWe have a practical illustration of this truth in the explosion of\r\nnitro-glycerine. If a small portion of this compound be exploded on the\r\nsurface of a granite bowlder, in the open air, the bowlder will be rent\r\ninto fragments. The explanation of this phenomenon common among the\r\nlaborers who are the most numerous witnesses of it, which you have\r\ndoubtless often heard, and which is accepted by ignorant minds without\r\nfurther thought, is that the action of nitro-glycerine is downward. We\r\nknow that such an idea is absurd.\r\n\r\nThe explosive force must be exerted in all directions equally. The real\r\nexplanation is, that the explosive action of nitro-glycerine is so\r\nnearly instantaneous, that the resistance of the atmosphere is very\r\nnearly equal to that of the rock; at any rate, is sufficient to cause\r\nthe rock to be broken up. The rock yields to the force very nearly as\r\nreadily as the atmosphere does.\r\n\r\n_Third_. An interesting solution is presented here of what is to many an\r\nastronomical puzzle. When I was younger than I am now, I was greatly\r\ntroubled to understand how it could be that if the moon was always\r\nfalling to the earth, as the astronomers assured us it was, it should\r\nnever reach it, nor have its falling velocity accelerated. In popular\r\ntreatises on astronomy, such for example as that of Professor Newcomb,\r\nthis is explained by a diagram in which the tangential line is carried\r\nout as in Fig. 1, and by showing that in falling from the point A to the\r\nearth as a center, through distances increasing as the square of the\r\ntime, the moon, having the tangential velocity that it has, could never\r\nget nearer to the earth than the circle in which it revolves around it.\r\nThis is all very true, and very unsatisfactory. We know that this long\r\ntangential line has nothing to do with the motion of the moon, and while\r\nwe are compelled to assent to the demonstration, we want something\r\nbetter. To my mind the better and more satisfactory explanation is found\r\nin the fact that the moon is forever commencing to fall, and is\r\ncontinually beginning to fall in a new direction. A revolving body, as\r\nwe have seen, never gets past that point, which is entirely beyond our\r\nsight and our comprehension, of beginning to fall, before the direction\r\nof its fall is changed. So, under the attraction of the earth, the moon\r\nis forever leaving a new tangential direction of motion at the same\r\nrate, without acceleration.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued_.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPRESSED AIR POWER SCHEMES.\r\n\r\nBy J. STURGEON, Engineer of the Birmingham Compressed Air Power Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the article on \"Gas, Air, and Water Power\" in the _Journal_ for Dec.\r\n8 last, you state that you await with some curiosity my reply to certain\r\npoints in reference to the compressed air power schemes alluded to in\r\nthat article. I now, therefore, take the liberty of submitting to you\r\nthe arguments on my side of the question (which are substantially the\r\nsame as those I am submitting to Mr. Hewson, the Borough Engineer of\r\nLeeds). The details and estimates for the Leeds scheme are not yet in a\r\nforward enough state to enable me to give them at present; but the whole\r\ncase is sufficiently worked out for Birmingham to enable a fair\r\ndeduction to be made therefrom as regards the utility of the system in\r\nother towns. In Birmingham, progress has been delayed owing to\r\ndifficulties in procuring a site for the works, and other matters of\r\ndetail. We have, however, recently succeeded in obtaining a suitable\r\nplace, and making arrangements for railway siding, water supply, etc.;\r\nand we hope to be in a position to start early in the present year.\r\n\r\nI inclose (1) a tabulated summary of the estimates for Birmingham\r\ndivided into stages of 3,000 gross indicated horse power at a time; (2)\r\na statement showing the cost to consumers in terms of indicated horse\r\npower and in different modes, more or less economical, of applying the\r\nair power in the consumers' engines; (3) a tracing showing the method of\r\nlaying the mains; (4) a tracing showing the method of collecting the\r\nmeter records at the central station, by means of electric apparatus,\r\nand ascertaining the exact amount of leakage.

If the pipes were simply\r\nburied in the ground, it would be almost impossible to trace leakage, or\r\neven to know of its existence. The income of the company might be\r\nwasting away, and the loss never suspected until the quarterly returns\r\nfrom the meters were obtained from the inspectors. Only then would it be\r\ndiscovered that there must be a great leak (or it might be several\r\nleaks) somewhere. But how would it be possible to trace them among 20 or\r\n30 miles of buried pipes? We cannot break up the public streets. The\r\nvery existence of the concern depends upon (1) the _daily_ checking of\r\nthe meter returns, and comparison with the output from the air\r\ncompressors, so as to ascertain the amount of leakage; (2) facility for\r\ntracing the locality of a leak; and (3) easy access to the mains with\r\nthe minimum of disturbance to the streets. It will be readily\r\nunderstood, from the drawings, how this is effected. First, the pipes\r\nare laid in concrete troughs, near the surface of the road, with\r\nremovable concrete covers strong enough to stand any overhead traffic.\r\nAt intervals there are junctions for service connections, with street\r\nboxes and covers serving as inspection chambers. These chambers are also\r\nprovided over the ball-valves, which serve as stop-valves in case of\r\nnecessity, and are so arranged that in case of a serious breach in the\r\nportion of main between any two of them, the rush of air to the breach\r\nwill blow them up to the corresponding seats and block off the broken\r\nportion of main. The air space around the pipe in the concrete trough\r\nwill convey for a long distance the whistling noise of a leak; and the\r\ninspectors, by listening at the inspection openings, will thus be\r\nenabled to rapidly trace their way almost to the exact spot where there\r\nis an escape. They have then only to remove the top surface of road\r\nmetal and the concrete cover in order to expose the pipe and get at the\r\nbreach. Leaks would mostly be found at joints; and, by measuring from\r\nthe nearest street opening, the inspectors would know where to break\r\nopen the road to arrive at the probable locality of the leak. A very\r\nslight leak can be heard a long way off by its peculiar whistling sound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPRESSED AIR POWER]\r\n\r\nThe next point is to obtain a daily report of the condition of the mains\r\nand the amount of leakage. It would be impracticable to employ an army\r\nof meter inspectors to take the records daily from all the meters in the\r\ndistrict. We therefore adopt the method of electric signaling shown in\r\nthe second drawing. In the engineer's office, at the central station, is\r\nfixed the dial shown in Fig. 1. Each consumer's meter is fitted with the\r\ncontact-making apparatus shown in Pig. 4, and in an enlarged form in\r\nFigs. 5 and 6, by which a current is sent round the electro-magnet, D\r\n(Fig. 1), attracting the armature, and drawing the disk forward\r\nsufficiently for the roller at I to pass over the center of one of the\r\npins, and so drop in between that and the next pin, thus completing the\r\nmotion, and holding the disk steadily opposite the figure. This action\r\ntakes place on any meter completing a unit of measurement of (say) 1,000\r\ncubic feet, at which point the contact makers touch. But suppose one\r\nmeter should be moving very slowly, and so retaining contact for some\r\ntime, while other meters were working rapidly; the armature at D would\r\nthen be held up to the magnet by the prolonged contact maintained by the\r\nslow moving meter, and so prevent the quick working meters from\r\nactuating it; and they would therefore pass the contact points without\r\nrecording. A meter might also stop dead at the point of contact on\r\nshutting off the air, and so hold up the armature; thus preventing\r\nothers from acting. To obviate this, we apply the disengaging apparatus\r\nshown at L (Fig. 4). The contact maker works on the center, m, having an\r\narmature on its opposite end. On contact being made, at the same time\r\nthat the magnet, D, is operated, the one at L is also operated,\r\nattracting the armature, and throwing over the end of the contact maker,\r\nl¹, on to the non-conducting side of the pin on the disk. Thus the whole\r\nmovement is rendered practically instantaneous, and the magnet at D is\r\nset at liberty for the next operation. A resistance can be interposed at\r\nL, if necessary, to regulate the period of the operation. The whole of\r\nthe meters work the common dial shown in Fig. 1, on which the gross\r\nresults only are recorded; and this is all we want to know in this way.\r\nThe action is so rapid, owing to the use of the magnetic disengaging\r\ngear, that the chances of two or more meters making contact at the same\r\nmoment are rendered extremely small. Should such a thing happen, it\r\nwould not matter, as it is only approximate results that we require in\r\nthis case; and the error, if any, would add to the apparent amount of\r\nleakage, and so be on the right side. Of course, the record of each\r\nconsumer's meter would be taken by the inspector at the end of every\r\nquarter, in order to make out the bill; and the totals thus obtained\r\nwould be checked by the gross results indicated by the main dial. In\r\nthis way, by a comparison of these results, a coefficient would soon be\r\narrived at, by which the daily recorded results could be corrected to an\r\nextremely accurate measurement. At the end of the working day, the\r\nengineer has merely to take down from the dial in his office the total\r\nrecord of air measured to the consumers, also the output of air from the\r\ncompressors, which he ascertains by means of a continuous counter on the\r\nengines, and the difference between the two will represent the loss. If\r\nthe loss is trifling, he will pass it over; if serious, he will send out\r\nhis inspectors to trace it. Thus there could be no long continued\r\nleakage, misuse, or robbery of the air, without the company becoming\r\naware of the fact, and so being enabled to take measures to stop or\r\nprevent it. The foregoing are absolutely essential adjuncts to any\r\nscheme of public motive power supply by compressed air, without which we\r\nshould be working in the dark, and could never be sure whether the\r\ncompany were losing or making money. With them, we know where we are and\r\nwhat we are doing.\r\n\r\nReferring to the estimates given in Table I., I may explain that the\r\nitem of repairs and renewals covers 10 per cent. on boilers and gas\r\nproducers, 5 per cent. on engines, 5 per cent. on buildings, and 5 per\r\ncent. on mains. Considering that the estimates include ample fitting\r\nshops, with the best and most suitable tools, and that the wages list\r\nincludes a staff of men whose chief work would be to attend to repairs,\r\netc., I think the above allowances ample. Each item also includes 5 per\r\ncent. for contingencies.\r\n\r\nI have commenced by giving all the preceding detail, in order to show\r\nthe groundwork on which I base the estimate of the cost of compressed\r\nair power to consumers, in terms of indicated horse power per annum, as\r\ngiven in Table II. I may say that, in estimating the engine power and\r\ncoal consumption, I have not, as in the original report, made purely\r\ntheoretical calculations, but have taken diagrams from engines in actual\r\nuse (although of somewhat smaller size than those intended to be\r\nemployed), and have worked out the results therefrom. It will, I hope,\r\nbe seen that, with all the safeguards we have provided, we may fairly\r\nreckon upon having for sale the stated quantity of air produced by means\r\nof the plant, as estimated, and at the specified annual cost; and that\r\ntherefore the statement of cost per indicated horse power per annum may\r\nbe fairly relied upon. Thus the cost of compressed air to the consumer,\r\nbased upon an _average_ charge of 5d. per 1,000 cubic feet, will vary\r\nfrom £6 14s. per indicated horse power per annum to £18 13s. 3d.,\r\naccording to circumstances and mode of application.\r\n\r\nA compressed air motor is an exceedingly simple machine--much simpler\r\nthan an ordinary steam engine. But the air may also be used in an\r\nordinary steam engine; and in this case it can be much simplified in\r\nmany details. Very little packing is needed, as there is no nuisance\r\nfrom gland leakage; the friction is therefore very slight. Pistons and\r\nglands are packed with soapstone, or other self-lubricating packing; and\r\nno oil is required except for bearings, etc. The company will undertake\r\nthe periodical inspection and overhauling of engines supplied with their\r\npower, all which is included in the estimates. The total cost to\r\nconsumers, with air at an average of 5d. per 1,000 cubic feet, may\r\ntherefore be fairly taken as follows:\r\n\r\n                                   Min.

The minimum given is\r\nat the average rate of 5d. per 1,000 cubic feet; but as there will be\r\nrates below this, according to a sliding scale, we may fairly take it\r\nthat the lowest charge will fall considerably below £6 per indicated\r\nhorse power per annum.--_Journal of Gas Lighting_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BERTHON COLLAPSIBLE CANOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn endeavor has often been made to construct a canoe that a person can\r\neasily carry overland and put into the water without aid, and convert\r\ninto a sailboat. The system that we now call attention to is very well\r\ncontrived, very light, easily taken apart, and for some years past has\r\nmet with much favor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--BERTHON COLLAPSIBLE CANOE AFLOAT.]\r\n\r\nMr. Berthon's canoes are made of impervious oil-skin. Form is given them\r\nby two stiff wooden gunwales which are held in position by struts that\r\ncan be easily put in and taken out. The model shown in the figure is\r\ncovered with oiled canvas, and is provided with a double paddle and a\r\nsmall sail. Fig. 2 represents it collapsed and being carried overland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--THE SAME BEING CARRIED OVERLAND.]\r\n\r\nMr. Berthon is manufacturing a still simpler style, which is provided\r\nwith two oars, as in an ordinary canoe. This model, which is much used\r\nin England by fishermen and hunters, has for several years past been\r\nemployed in the French navy, in connection with movable defenses. At\r\npresent, every torpedo boat carries one or two of these canoes, each\r\ncomposed of two independent halves that may be put into the water\r\nseparately or be joined together by an iron rod.\r\n\r\nThese boats ride the water very well, and are very valuable for\r\nexploring quarters whither torpedo boats could not adventure without\r\ndanger.[1]--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For detailed description see SUPPLEMENT, No. 84.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OPENING OF THE FIRST GERMAN STEAM\r\nRAILROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was great excitement in Nürnberg on the 7th of December, 1835, on\r\nwhich day the first German railroad was opened. The great square on\r\nwhich the buildings of the Nürnberg and Furth \"Ludwig's Road\" stood, the\r\nneighboring streets, and, in fact, the whole road between the two\r\ncities, was filled with a crowd of people who flocked from far and near\r\nto see the wonderful spectacle. For the first time, a railroad train\r\nfilled with passengers was to be drawn from Nürnberg to Furth by the\r\ninvisible power of the steam horse. At eight o'clock in the morning, the\r\ncivil and military authorities, etc., who took part in the celebration\r\nwere assembled on the square, and the gayly decorated train started off\r\nto an accompaniment of music, cannonading, cheering, etc. Everything\r\npassed off without an accident; the work was a success. The engraving in\r\nthe lower right-hand corner represents the engine and cars of this road.\r\n\r\nIt will be plainly seen that such a revolution could not be accomplished\r\neasily, and that much sacrifice and energy were required of the leaders\r\nin the enterprise, prominent among whom was the merchant Johannes\r\nScharrer, who is known as the founder of the \"Ludwig's Road.\"\r\n\r\nOne would naturally suppose that such an undertaking would have met with\r\nencouragement from the Bavarian Government, but this was not the case.\r\nThe starters of the enterprise met with opposition on every side; much\r\nwas written against it, and many comic pictures were drawn showing\r\naccidents which would probably occur on the much talked of road. Two of\r\nthese pictures are shown in the accompanying large engraving, taken from\r\nthe _Illustrirte Zeitung_. As shown in the center picture, right hand,\r\nit was expected by the railway opponents that trains running on tracks\r\nat right angles must necessarily come in collision. If anything happened\r\nto the engine, the passengers would have to get out and push the cars,\r\nas shown at the left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUBILEE CELEBRATION OF THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE\r\nOPENING OF THE FIRST STEAM RAILWAY IN GERMANY--AT NURNBERG]\r\n\r\nMuch difficulty was experienced in finding an engineer capable of\r\nattending to the construction of the road; and at first it was thought\r\nthat it would be best to engage an Englishman, but finally Engineer\r\nDenis, of Munich, was appointed. He had spent much time in England and\r\nAmerica studying the roads there, and carried on this work to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of the company.\r\n\r\nAll materials for the road were, as far as possible, procured in\r\nGermany; but the idea of building the engines and cars there had to be\r\ngiven up, and, six weeks before the opening of the road, Geo.\r\nStephenson, of London, whose engine, Rocket, had won the first prize in\r\nthe competitive trials at Rainhill in 1829, delivered an engine of ten\r\nhorse power, which is still known in Nürnberg as \"Der Englander.\"\r\n\r\nFifty years have passed, and, as Johannes Scharrer predicted, the\r\nLudwig's Road has become a permanent institution, though it now forms\r\nonly a very small part of the network of railroads which covers every\r\nportion of Germany. What changes have been made in railroads during\r\nthese fifty years! Compare the present locomotives with the one made by\r\nCugnot in 1770, shown in the upper left-hand cut, and with the work of\r\nthe pioneer Geo. Stephenson, who in 1825 constructed the first passenger\r\nrailroad in England, and who established a locomotive factory in\r\nNewcastle in 1824. Geo. Stephenson was to his time what Mr. Borsig,\r\nwhose great works at Moabit now turn out from 200 to 250 locomotives a\r\nyear, is to our time.\r\n\r\nTruly, in this time there can be no better occasion for a celebration of\r\nthis kind than the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the first\r\nGerman railroad, which has lately been celebrated by Nürnberg and Furth.\r\n\r\nThe lower left-hand view shows the locomotive De Witt Clinton, the third\r\none built in the United States for actual service, and the coaches. The\r\nengine was built at the West Point Foundry, and was successfully tested\r\non the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad between Albany and Schenectady on Aug.\r\n9, 1831.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED COAL ELEVATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn illustration of a new coal elevator is herewith presented, which\r\npresents advantages over any incline yet used, so that a short\r\ndescription may be deemed interesting to those engaged in the coaling\r\nand unloading of vessels. The pen sketch shows at a glance the\r\narrangement and space the elevator occupies, taking less ground to do\r\nthe same amount of work than any other mode heretofore adopted, and the\r\nfirst cost of erecting is about the same as any other.\r\n\r\nWhen the expense of repairing damages caused by the ravages of winter is\r\ntaken into consideration, and no floats to pump out or tracks to wash\r\naway, the advantages should be in favor of a substantial structure.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of this hoist is to elevate 80,000 bushels in ten hours, at\r\nless than one-half cent per bushel, and put coal in elevator, yard, or\r\nshipping bins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED COAL ELEVATOR.]\r\n\r\nThe endless wire rope takes the cars out and returns them, dispensing\r\nwith the use of train riders.\r\n\r\nA floating elevator can distribute coal at any hatch on steam vessels,\r\nas the coal has to be handled but once; the hoist depositing an empty\r\ncar where there is a loaded one in boat or barge, requiring no swing of\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\nMr. J.R.

It has rendered necessary the construction of special plant in the\r\nform of ladles of dimensions hitherto quite unknown. Messrs. Stevenson &\r\nCo., of Preston, make the construction of these ladles a specialty, and\r\nby their courtesy, says _The Engineer_, we are enabled to illustrate\r\nfour different types, each steel works manager, as is natural,\r\npreferring his own design. Ladles are also required in steel foundry\r\nwork, and one of these for the Siemens-Martin process is illustrated by\r\nFig. 1. These ladles are made in sizes to take from five to fifteen ton\r\ncharges, or larger if required, and are mounted on a very strong\r\ncarriage with a backward and forward traversing motion, and tipping gear\r\nfor the ladle. The ladles are butt jointed, with internal cover strips,\r\nand have a very strong band shrunk on hot about half way in the depth of\r\nthe ladle. This forms an abutment for supporting the ladle in the\r\ngudgeon band, being secured to this last by latch bolts and cotters. The\r\ngearing is made of cast steel, and there is a platform at one end for\r\nthe person operating the carriage or tipping the ladle. Stopper gear and\r\na handle are fitted to the ladles to regulate the flow of the molten\r\nsteel from the nozzle at the bottom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADLES FOR CARRYING MOLTEN IRON AND STEEL.]\r\n\r\nFig. 2 shows a Spiegel ladle, of the pattern used at Cyfarthfa. It\r\nrequires no description. Fig. 3 shows a tremendous ladle constructed for\r\nthe North-Eastern Steel Company, for carrying molten metal from the\r\nblast furnace to the converter. It holds ten tons with ease. It is an\r\nexceptionally strong structure. The carriage frame is constructed\r\nthroughout of 1 in. wrought-iron plated, and is made to suit the\r\nordinary 4 ft. 8½ in. railway gauge. The axle boxes are cast iron,\r\nfitted with gun-metal steps. The wheels are made of forged iron, with\r\nsteel tires and axles. The carriage is provided with strong oak buffers,\r\nplanks, and spring buffers; the drawbars also have helical compression\r\nsprings of the usual type. The ladle is built up of ½ in. wrought-iron\r\nplates, butt jointed, and double riveted butt straps. The trunnions and\r\nflange couplings are of cast steel. The tipping gear, clearly shown in\r\nthe engraving, consists of a worm and wheel, both of steel, which can be\r\nfixed on either side of the ladle as may be desired. From this it will\r\nbe seen that Messrs. Stevenson & Co. have made a thoroughly strong\r\nstructure in every respect, and one, therefore, that will commend itself\r\nto most steel makers. We understand that these carriages are made in\r\nvarious designs and sizes to meet special requirements. Thus, Fig. 4\r\nshows one of different design, made for a steel works in the North. This\r\nis also a large ladle. The carriage is supported on helical springs and\r\nsolid steel wheels. It will readily be understood that very great care\r\nand honesty of purpose is required in making these structures. A\r\nbreakdown might any moment pour ten tons of molten metal on the ground,\r\nwith the most horrible results.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR DEMONSTRATING THAT ELECTRICITY DEVELOPS ONLY ON THE\r\nSURFACE OF CONDUCTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. K.L. Bauer, of Carlsruhe, has just constructed a very simple and\r\ningenious apparatus which permits of demonstrating that electricity\r\ndevelops only on the surface of conductors. It consists (see figure)\r\nessentially of a yellow-metal disk, M, fixed to an insulating support,\r\nF, and carrying a concentric disk of ebonite, H. This latter receives a\r\nhollow and closed hemisphere, J, of yellow metal, whose base has a\r\nsmaller diameter than that of the disk, H, and is perfectly insulated by\r\nthe latter. Another yellow-metal hemisphere, S, open below, is connected\r\nwith an insulating handle, G. The basal diameter of this second\r\nhemisphere is such that when the latter is placed over J its edge rests\r\nupon the lower disk, M. These various pieces being supposed placed as\r\nshown in the figure, the shell, S, forms with the disk, M, a hollow,\r\nclosed hemisphere that imprisons the hemisphere, J, which is likewise\r\nhollow and closed, and perfectly insulated from the former.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe shell, S, is provided internally with a curved yellow-metal spring,\r\nwhose point of attachment is at B, and whose free extremity is connected\r\nwith an ebonite button, K, which projects from the shell, S. By pressing\r\nthis button, a contact may be established between the external\r\nhemisphere (formed of the pieces, S and M), and the internal one, J. As\r\nsoon as the button is left to itself, the spring again begins to bear\r\nagainst the interior surface of S, and the two hemispheres are again\r\ninsulated.\r\n\r\nThe experiment is performed in this wise: The shell, S, is removed. Then\r\na disk of steatite affixed to an insulating handle is rubbed for a few\r\ninstants with a fox's \"brush,\" and held near J until a spark occurs.\r\nThen the apparatus is grasped by the support, F, and an elder-pith ball\r\nsuspended by a flaxen thread from a good conducting support is brought\r\nnear J. The ball will be quickly repelled, and care must be taken that\r\nit does not come into contact with J. After this the apparatus is placed\r\nupon a table, the shell, S, is taken by its handle, G, and placed in the\r\nposition shown in the figure, and a momentary contact is established\r\nbetween the two hemispheres by pressing the button, K. Then the shell,\r\nS, is lifted, and the disk, M, is touched at the same time with the\r\nother hand. If, now, the pith ball be brought near S, it will be quickly\r\nrepelled, while it will remain stationary if it be brought near J, thus\r\nproving that all the electricity passed from J to S at the moment of\r\ncontact.--_La Lumiere Electrique_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLSON TELEPHONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis apparatus has recently been the object of some experiments which\r\nresulted in its being finally adopted in the army. We think that our\r\nreaders will read a description of it with interest. Its mode of\r\nconstruction is based upon a theoretic conception of the lines of force,\r\nwhich its inventor explains as follows in his Elementary Treatise on\r\nElectricity:\r\n\r\n\"To every position of the disk of a magnetic telephone with respect to\r\nthe poles of the magnet there corresponds a certain distribution of the\r\nlines of force, which latter shift themselves when the disk is\r\nvibrating. If the bobbin be met by these lines in motion, there will\r\ndevelop in its wire a difference of potential that, according to\r\nFaraday's law, will be proportional to their number. All things equal,\r\nthen, a telephone transmitter will be so much the more potent in\r\nproportion as the lines set in motion by the vibrations of the disk and\r\nmeeting the bobbin wire are greater in number. In like manner, a\r\nreceiver will be so much the more potent in proportion as the lines of\r\nforce, set in motion by variations in the induced currents that are\r\ntraversing the bobbin and meeting the disk, are more numerous. It will\r\nconsequently be seen that, generally speaking, it is well to send as\r\nlarge a number of lines of force as possible through the bobbin.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--THE COLSON TELEPHONE.]\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain such a result, the thin tin-plate disk has to be\r\nplaced between the two poles of the magnet. The pole that carries the\r\nfine wire bobbin acts at one side and in the center of the disk, while\r\nthe other is expanded at the extremity and acts upon the edge and the\r\nother side. This pole is separated from the disk by a copper washer, and\r\nthe disk is thus wholly immersed in the magnetic field, and is traversed\r\nby the lines of force radiatingly.\r\n\r\nThis telephone is being constructed by Mr. De Branville, with the\r\ngreatest care, in the form of a transmitter (Fig. 2) and receiver (Fig.\r\n3). At A may be seen the magnet with its central pole, P, and its\r\neccentric one, P'. This latter traverses the vibrating disk, M, through\r\na rubber-lined aperture and connects with the soft iron ring, F, that\r\nforms the polar expansion. These pieces are inclosed in a nickelized\r\ncopper box provided with a screw cap, C. The resistance of both the\r\nreceiver and transmitter bobbin is 200 ohms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--TRANSMITTER TAKEN APART.]\r\n\r\nThe transmitter is 3½ in. in diameter, and is provided with a\r\nre-enforcing mouthpiece. It is regulated by means of a screw which is\r\nfixed in the bottom of the box, and which permits of varying the\r\ndistance between the disk and the core that forms the central pole of\r\nthe magnet. The regulation, when once effected, lasts indefinitely. The\r\nregulation of the receiver, which is but 2¼ in. in diameter, is\r\nperformed once for all by the manufacturer. One of the advantages of\r\nthis telephone is that its regulation is permanent. Besides this, it\r\npossesses remarkable power and clearness, and is accompanied with no\r\nsnuffling sounds, a fact doubtless owing to all the molecules of the\r\ndisk being immersed in the magnetic field, and to the actions of the two\r\npoles occurring concentrically with the disk. As we have above said,\r\nthis apparatus is beginning to be appreciated, and has already been the\r\nobject of several applications in the army. The transmitter is used by\r\nthe artillery service in the organization of observatories from which to\r\nwatch firing, and the receiver is added to the apparatus pertaining to\r\nmilitary telegraphy. The two small receivers are held to the lens of the\r\noperator by the latter's hat strap, while the transmitter is suspended\r\nin a case supported by straps, with the mouthpieces near the face (Fig.\r\n1).\r\n\r\nIn the figure, the case is represented as open, so as to show the\r\ntransmitter. The empty compartment below is designed for the reception\r\nand carriage of the receivers, straps, and flexible cords. This\r\narrangement permits of calling without the aid of special apparatus, and\r\nit has also the advantage of giving entire freedom to the man on\r\nobservation, this being something that is indispensable in a large\r\nnumber of cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--RECEIVER TAKEN APART.]\r\n\r\nIn certain applications, of course, the receivers may be combined with a\r\nmicrophone; yet on an aerial as well as on a subterranean line the\r\ntransmitter produces effects which, as regards intensity and clearness,\r\nare comparable with those of a pile transmitter.\r\n\r\nStations wholly magnetic may be established by adding to the transmitter\r\nand two receivers a Sieur phonic call, which will actuate them\r\npowerfully, and cause them to produce a noise loud enough for a call. It\r\nwould be interesting to try this telephone on a city line, and to a\r\ngreat distance on those telegraph lines that are provided with the Van\r\nRysselberghe system. Excellent results would certainly be obtained, for,\r\nas we have recently been enabled to ascertain, the voice has a\r\nremarkable intensity in this telephone, while at the same time perfectly\r\npreserving its quality.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[NATURE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MELDOMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparatus which I propose to call by the above name\r\n([mu][epsilon][lambda][delta][omega], to melt) consists of an adjunct to\r\nthe mineralogical microscope, whereby the melting-points of minerals may\r\nbe compared or approximately determined and their behavior watched at\r\nhigh temperatures either alone or in the presence of reagents.\r\n\r\nAs I now use it, it consists of a narrow ribbon of platinum (2 mm. wide)\r\narranged to traverse the field of the microscope. The ribbon, clamped in\r\ntwo brass clamps so as to be readily renewable, passes bridgewise over a\r\nlittle scooped-out hollow in a disk of ebony (4 cm. diam.). The clamps\r\nalso take wires from a battery (3 Groves cells); and an adjustable\r\nresistance being placed in circuit, the strip can be thus raised in\r\ntemperature up to the melting-point of platinum.\r\n\r\nThe disk being placed on the stage of the microscope the platinum strip\r\nis brought into the field of a 1\" objective, protected by a glass slip\r\nfrom the radiant heat. The observer is sheltered from the intense light\r\nat high temperatures by a wedge of tinted glass, which further can be\r\nused in photometrically estimating the temperature by using it to obtain\r\nextinction of the field. Once for all approximate estimations of the\r\ntemperature of the field might be made in terms of the resistance of the\r\nplatinum strip, the variation of such resistance with rise of\r\ntemperature being known. Such observations being made on a suitably\r\nprotected strip might be compared with the wedge readings, the latter\r\nbeing then used for ready determinations. Want of time has hindered me\r\nfrom making such observations up to this.\r\n\r\nThe mineral to be experimented on is placed in small fragments near the\r\ncenter of the platinum ribbon, and closely watched while the current is\r\nincreased, till the melting-point of the substance is apparent. Up to\r\nthe present I have only used it comparatively, laying fragments of\r\ndifferent fusibilities near the specimen. In this way I have melted\r\nberyl, orthoclase, and quartz. I was much surprised to find the last\r\nmineral melt below the melting-point of platinum. I have, however, by me\r\nas I write, a fragment, formerly clear rock-crystal, so completely fused\r\nthat between crossed Nicols it behaves as if an amorphous body, save in\r\nthe very center where a speck of flashing color reveals the remains of\r\nmolecular symmetry. Bubbles have formed in the surrounding glass.\r\n\r\nOrthoclase becomes a clear glass filled with bubbles: at a lower\r\ntemperature beryl behaves in the same way.\r\n\r\nTopaz whitens to a milky glass--apparently decomposing, throwing out\r\nfilmy threads of clear glass and bubbles of glass which break,\r\nliberating a gas (fluorine?) which, attacking the white-hot platinum,\r\ncauses rings of color to appear round the specimen. I have now been\r\nusing the apparatus for nearly a month, and in its earliest days it led\r\nme right in the diagnosis of a microscopical mineral, iolite, not before\r\nfound in our Irish granite, I think. The unlooked-for characters of the\r\nmineral, coupled with the extreme minuteness of the crystals, led me\r\npreviously astray, until my meldometer fixed its fusibility for me as\r\nfar above the suspected bodies.\r\n\r\nCarbon slips were at first used, as I was unaware of the capabilities of\r\nplatinum.\r\n\r\nA form of the apparatus adapted, at Prof. Fitzgerald's suggestion, to\r\nfit into the lantern for projection on the screen has been made for me\r\nby Yeates. In this form the heated conductor passes both below and above\r\nthe specimen, which is regarded from a horizontal direction.\r\n\r\nJ.

The practical uses to which this subtile fluid,\r\nelectricity, is being put are causing changes to be made in time-tested\r\nmethods of doing things in domestic, scientific, and business circles,\r\nand the time has passed when startling propositions to accomplish this\r\nor that by the assistance of electricity are dismissed with incredulous\r\nsmiles. This being the case, no surprise need follow the announcement of\r\na device to facilitate the imparting of instruction to deaf children\r\nwhich calls into requisition some service from electricity.\r\n\r\nThe sense of touch is the direct medium contemplated, and it is intended\r\nto convey, with accuracy and rapidity, messages from the operator (the\r\nteacher) to the whole class simultaneously by electrical\r\ntransmission.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: By the same means two deaf-mutes, miles apart, might\r\nconverse with each other, and the greatest difficulty in the way of a\r\ndeaf-mute becoming a telegraph operator, that of receiving messages,\r\nwould be removed. The latter possibilities are incidentally mentioned\r\nmerely as of scientific interest, and not because of their immediate\r\npractical value. The first mentioned use to which the device may be\r\napplied is the one considered by the writer as possibly of practical\r\nvalue, the consideration of which suggested the appliance to him.]\r\n\r\nAn alphabet is formed upon the palm of the left hand and the inner side\r\nof the fingers, as shown by the accompanying cut, which, to those\r\nbecoming familiar with it, requires but a touch upon a certain point of\r\nthe hand to indicate a certain letter of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nA rapid succession of touches upon various points of the hand is all\r\nthat is necessary in spelling a sentence. The left hand is the one upon\r\nwhich the imaginary alphabet is formed, merely to leave the right hand\r\nfree to operate without change of position when two persons only are\r\nconversing face to face.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the alphabet here figured is on the same principle as\r\none invented by George Dalgarno, a Scottish schoolmaster, in the year\r\n1680, a cut of which maybe seen on page 19 of vol. ix. of the _Annals_,\r\naccompanying the reprint of a work entitled \"_Didascalocophus_.\"\r\nDalgarno's idea could only have been an alphabet to be used in\r\nconversation between two persons _tête à tête_, and--except to a limited\r\nextent in the Horace Mann School and in Professor Bell's teaching--has\r\nnot come into service in the instruction of deaf-mutes or as a means of\r\nconversation. There seems to have been no special design or system in\r\nthe arrangement of the alphabet into groups of letters oftenest\r\nappearing together, and in several instances the proximity would\r\nseriously interfere with distinct spelling; for instance, the group \"u,\"\r\n\"y,\" \"g,\" is formed upon the extreme joint of the little finger. The\r\nslight discoverable system that seems to attach to his arrangement of\r\nthe letters is the placing of the vowels in order upon the points of the\r\nfingers successively, beginning with the thumb, intended, as we suppose,\r\nto be of mnemonic assistance to the learner. Such assistance is hardly\r\nnecessary, as a pupil will learn one arrangement about as rapidly as\r\nanother. If any arrangement has advantage over another, we consider it\r\nthe one which has so grouped the letters as to admit of an increased\r\nrapidity of manipulation. The arrangement of the above alphabet, it is\r\nbelieved, does admit of this. Yet it is not claimed that it is as\r\nperfect as the test of actual use may yet make it. Improvements in the\r\narrangement will, doubtless, suggest themselves, when the alterations\r\ncan be made with little need of affecting the principle.\r\n\r\nIn order to transmit a message by this alphabet, the following described\r\nappliance is suggested: A matrix of cast iron, or made of any suitable\r\nmaterial, into which the person receiving the message (the pupil) places\r\nhis left hand, palm down, is fixed to the table or desk. The matrix,\r\nfitting the hand, has twenty-six holes in it, corresponding in position\r\nto the points upon the hand assigned to the different letters of the\r\nalphabet. In these holes are small styles, or sharp points, which are so\r\nplaced as but slightly to touch the hand. Connected with each style is a\r\nshort line of wire, the other end of which is connected with a principal\r\nwire leading to the desk of the operator (the teacher), and there so\r\narranged as to admit of opening and closing the circuit of an electric\r\ncurrent at will by the simple touch of a button, and thereby producing\r\nalong the line of that particular wire simultaneous electric impulses,\r\nintended to act mechanically upon all the styles connected with it. By\r\nthese impulses, produced by the will of the sender, the styles are\r\ndriven upward with a quick motion, but with only sufficient force to be\r\nfelt and located upon the hand by the recipient. Twenty-six of these\r\nprincipal or primary wires are run from the teacher's desk (there\r\nconnected with as many buttons) under the floor along the line of\r\npupils' desks. From each matrix upon the desk run twenty-six secondary\r\nwires down to and severally connecting with the twenty-six primary wires\r\nunder the floor. The whole system of wires is incased so as to be out of\r\nsight and possibility of contact with foreign substances. The keys or\r\nbuttons upon the desk of the teacher are systematically arranged,\r\nsomewhat after the order of those of the type writer, which allows the\r\nuse of either one or both hands of the operator, and of the greatest\r\nattainable speed in manipulation. The buttons are labeled \"a,\" \"b,\" \"c,\"\r\netc., to \"z,\" and an electric current over the primary wire running from\r\na certain button (say the one labeled \"a\") affects only those secondary\r\nwires connected with the styles that, when excited, produce upon the\r\nparticular spot of the hands of the receivers the tactile impression to\r\nbe interpreted as \"a.\" And so, whenever the sender touches any of the\r\nbuttons on his desk, immediately each member of the class feels upon the\r\npalm of his hand the impression meant to be conveyed. The contrivance\r\nwill admit of being operated with as great rapidity as it is probable\r\nhuman dexterity could achieve, i.e., as the strokes of an electric bell.\r\nIt was first thought of conveying the impressions directly by slight\r\nelectric shocks, without the intervention of further mechanical\r\napparatus, but owing to a doubt as to the physical effect that might be\r\nproduced upon the persons receiving, and as to whether the nerves might\r\nnot in time become partly paralyzed or so inured to the effect as to\r\nrequire a stronger and stronger current, that idea was abandoned, and\r\nthe one described adopted. A diagram of the apparatus was submitted to a\r\nskillful electrical engineer and machinist of Hartford, who gave as his\r\nopinion that the scheme was entirely feasible, and that a simple and\r\ncomparatively inexpensive mechanism would produce the desired result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOUCH TRANSMISSION BY ELECTRICITY.]\r\n\r\nThe matter now to consider, and the one of greater interest to the\r\nteacher of deaf children, is, Of what utility can the device be in the\r\ninstruction of deaf-mutes? What advantage is there, not found in the\r\nprevailing methods of communication with the deaf, i.e., by gestures,\r\ndactylology, speech and speech-reading, and writing?\r\n\r\nI. The language of gestures, first systematized and applied to the\r\nconveying of ideas to the deaf by the Abbe de l'Epee during the latter\r\npart of the last century, has been, in America, so developed and\r\nimproved upon by Gallaudet, Peet, and their successors, as to leave but\r\nlittle else to be desired for the purpose for which it was intended. The\r\nrapidity and ease with which ideas can be expressed and understood by\r\nthis \"language\" will never cease to be interesting and wonderful, and\r\nits value to the deaf can never fail of being appreciated by those\r\nfamiliar with it. But the genius of the language of signs is such as to\r\nbe in itself of very little, if any, direct assistance in the\r\nacquisition of syntactical language, owing to the diversity in the order\r\nof construction existing between the English language and the language\r\nof signs. Sundry attempts have been made to enforce upon the\r\nsign-language conformity to the English order, but they have, in all\r\ncases known to the writer, been attended with failure. The sign-language\r\nis as immovable as the English order, and in this instance certainly\r\nMahomet and the mountain will never know what it is to be in each\r\nother's embrace. School exercises in language composition are given with\r\ngreat success upon the basis of the sign-language. But in all such\r\nexercises there must be a translation from one language to the other.\r\nThe desideratum still exists of an increased percentage of pupils\r\nleaving our schools for the deaf, possessing a facility of expression in\r\nEnglish vernacular. This want has been long felt, and endeavoring to\r\nfind a reason for the confessedly low percentage, the sign-language has\r\nbeen too often unjustly accused. It is only when the sign-language is\r\nabused that its merit as a means of instruction degenerates. The most\r\nardent admirers of a proper use of signs are free to admit that any\r\nexcessive use by the pupils, which takes away all opportunities to\r\nexpress themselves in English, is detrimental to rapid progress in\r\nEnglish expression.\r\n\r\nII. To the general public, dactylology or finger spelling is the\r\nsign-language, or the basis of that language, but to the profession\r\nthere is no relation between the two methods of communication.\r\nDactylology has the advantage of putting language before the eye in\r\nconformity with English syntax, and it has always held its place as one\r\nof the elements of the American or eclectic method. This advantage,\r\nhowever, is not of so great importance as to outweigh the disadvantages\r\nwhen, as has honestly been attempted, it asserts its independence of\r\nother methods. Very few persons indeed, even after long practice, become\r\nsufficiently skillful in spelling on the fingers to approximate the\r\nrapidity of speech. But were it possible for all to become rapid\r\nspellers, another very important requisite is necessary before the\r\nsystem could be a perfect one, that is, the ability to _read_ rapid\r\nspelling. The number of persons capable of reading the fingers beyond a\r\nmoderate degree of rapidity is still less than the number able to spell\r\nrapidly. While it is physically possible to follow rapid spelling for\r\ntwenty or thirty minutes, it can scarcely be followed longer than that.\r\nSo long as this is true, dactylology can hardly claim to be more than\r\none of the _elements_ of a system of instruction for the deaf.\r\n\r\nIII. Articulate speech is another of the elements of the eclectic\r\nmethod, employed with success inversely commensurate with the degree of\r\ndeficiency arising from deafness. Where the English order is already\r\nfixed in his mind, and he has at an early period of life habitually used\r\nit, there is comparatively little difficulty in instructing the deaf\r\nchild by speech, especially if he have a quick eye and bright intellect.\r\nBut the number so favored is a small percentage of the great body of\r\ndeaf-mutes whom we are called upon to educate. When it is used as a\r\n_sole_ means of educating the deaf as a class its inability to stand\r\nalone is as painfully evident as that of any of the other component\r\nparts of the system. It would seem even less practicable than a sole\r\nreliance upon dactylology would be, for there can be no doubt as to what\r\na word is if spelled slowly enough, and if its meaning has been learned.\r\nThis cannot be said of speech. Between many words there is not, when\r\nuttered, the slightest visible distinction. Between a greater number of\r\nothers the distinction is so slight as to cause an exceedingly nervous\r\nhesitation before a guess can be given. Too great an imposition is put\r\nupon the eye to expect it to follow unaided the extremely circumscribed\r\ngestures of the organs of speech visible in ordinary speaking. The ear\r\nis perfection as an interpreter of speech to the brain. It cannot\r\ncorrectly be said that it is _more_ than perfection. It is known that\r\nthe ear, in the interpretation of vocal sounds, is capable of\r\ndistinguishing as many as thirty-five sounds per second (and oftentimes\r\nmore), and to follow a speaker speaking at the rate of more than two\r\nhundred words per minute. If this be perfection, can we expect the _eye_\r\nof ordinary mortal to reach it? Is there wonder that the task is a\r\ndiscouraging one for the deaf child?\r\n\r\nBut it has been asserted that while a large percentage (practically all)\r\nof the deaf _can_, by a great amount of painstaking and practice, become\r\nspeech readers in some small degree, a relative degree of facility in\r\narticulation is not nearly so attainable. As to the accuracy of this\r\nview, the writer cannot venture an opinion. Judging from the average\r\ncongenital deaf-mute who has had special instruction in speech, it can\r\nsafely be asserted that their speech is laborious, and far, very far,\r\nfrom being accurate enough for practical use beyond a limited number of\r\ncommon expressions. This being the case, it is not surprising that as an\r\nunaided means of instruction it cannot be a success, for English neither\r\nunderstood when spoken, nor spoken by the pupil, cannot but remain a\r\nforeign language, requiring to pass through some other form of\r\ntranslation before it becomes intelligible.\r\n\r\nThere are the same obstacles in the use of the written or printed word\r\nas have been mentioned in connection with dactylology, namely, lack of\r\nrapidity in conveying impressions through the medium of the English\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nI have thus hastily reviewed the several means which teachers generally\r\nare employing to impart the use of English to deaf pupils, for the\r\npurpose of showing a common difficulty. The many virtues of each have\r\nbeen left unnoticed, as of no pertinence to this article.\r\n\r\nThe device suggested at the beginning of this paper, claiming to be\r\nnothing more than a school room appliance intended to supplement the\r\nexisting means for giving a knowledge and practice of English to the\r\ndeaf, employs as its interpreter a different sense from the one\r\nuniversally used. The sense of sight is the sole dependence of the deaf\r\nchild. Signs, dactylology, speech reading, and the written and printed\r\nword are all dependent upon the eye for their value as educational\r\ninstruments. It is evident that of the two senses, sight and touch, if\r\nbut one could be employed, the choice of sight as the one best adapted\r\nfor the greatest number of purposes is an intelligent one; but, as the\r\nchoice is not limited, the question arises whether, in recognizing the\r\nsuperior adaptability to our purpose of the one, we do not lose sight of\r\na possibly important, though secondary, function in the other. If sight\r\nwere all-sufficient, there would be no need of a combination. But it\r\ncannot be maintained that such is the case. The plan by which we acquire\r\nour vernacular is of divine, and not of human, origin, and the senses\r\ndesigned for special purposes are not interchangeable without loss. The\r\ntheory that the loss of a certain sense is nearly, if not quite,\r\ncompensated for by increased acuteness of the remaining ones has been\r\nexploded. Such a theory accuses, in substance, the Maker of creating\r\nsomething needless, and is repugnant to the conceptions we have of the\r\nSupreme Being. When one sense is absent, the remaining senses, in order\r\nto equalize the loss, have imposed upon them an unusual amount of\r\nactivity, from which arises skill and dexterity, and by which the loss\r\nof the other sense is in some measure alleviated, but not supplied. No\r\n_additional_ power is given to the eye after the loss of the sense of\r\nhearing other than it might have acquired with the same amount of\r\npractice while both faculties were active. The fact, however, that the\r\nsenses, in performing their proper functions, are not overtaxed, and are\r\ntherefore, in cases of emergency, capable of being extended so as to\r\nperform, in various degrees, additional service, is one of the wise\r\nprovidences of God, and to this fact is due the possibility of whatever\r\nof success is attained in the work of educating the deaf, as well as the\r\nblind.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the blind, the sense of touch is called into increased\r\nactivity by the absence of the lost sense; while in the case of the\r\ndeaf, sight is asked to do this additional service. A blind person's\r\neducation is received principally through the _two_ senses of hearing\r\nand touch. Neither of these faculties is so sensible to fatigue by\r\nexcessive use as is the sense of sight, and yet the eye has, in every\r\nsystem of instruction applied to the deaf, been the sole medium. In no\r\ncase known to the writer, excepting in the celebrated case of Laura\r\nBridgman and a few others laboring under the double affliction of\r\ndeafness and blindness, has the sense of touch been employed as a means\r\nof instruction.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This article was written before Professor Bell had made his\r\ninteresting experiments with his \"parents' class\" of a touch alphabet,\r\nto be used upon the pupil's shoulder in connection with the oral\r\nteaching.--E.A.F.]\r\n\r\nNot taking into account the large percentage of myopes among the deaf,\r\nwe believe there are other cogent reasons why, if found practicable, the\r\nuse of the sense of touch may become an important element in our\r\neclectic system of teaching. We should reckon it of considerable\r\nimportance if it were ascertained that a portion of the same work now\r\nperformed by the eye could be accomplished equally as well through\r\nfeeling, thereby relieving the eye of some of its onerous duties.\r\n\r\nWe see no good reason why such accomplishment may not be wrought. If,\r\nperchance, it were discovered that a certain portion could be performed\r\nin a more efficient manner, its value would thus be further enhanced.\r\n\r\nIn theory and practice, the teacher of language to the deaf, by whatever\r\nmethod, endeavors to present to the eye of the child as many completed\r\nsentences as are nominally addressed to the ear--having them \"caught\" by\r\nthe eye and reproduced with as frequent recurrence as is ordinarily done\r\nby the child of normal faculties.\r\n\r\nIn our hasty review of the methods now in use we noted the inability to\r\napproximate this desirable process as a common difficulty. The facility\r\nnow ordinarily attained in the manipulation of the type writer, and the\r\nspeed said to have been reached by Professor Bell and a private pupil of\r\nhis by the Dalgarno touch alphabet, when we consider the possibility of\r\na less complex mechanism in the one case and a more systematic grouping\r\nof the alphabet in the other, would lead us to expect a more rapid means\r\nof communication than is ordinarily acquired by dactylology, speech (by\r\nthe deaf), or writing. Then the ability to receive the communication\r\nrapidly by the sense of feeling will be far greater. No part of the body\r\nexcept the point of the tongue is as sensible to touch as the tips of\r\nthe fingers and the palm of the hand. Tactile discrimination is so acute\r\nas to be able to interpret to the brain significant impressions produced\r\nin very rapid succession. Added to this advantage is the greater one of\r\nthe absence of any more serious attendant physical or nervous strain\r\nthan is present when the utterances of speech fall upon the tympanum of\r\nthe ear. To sum up, then, the advantages of the device we find--\r\n\r\nFirst. A more rapid means of communication with the deaf by syntactic\r\nlanguage, admitting of a greater amount of practice similar to that\r\nreceived through the ear by normal children.\r\n\r\nSecond. Ability to receive this rapid communication for a longer\r\nduration and without ocular strain.\r\n\r\nThird. Perfect freedom of the eye to watch the expression on the\r\ncountenance of the sender.\r\n\r\nFourth. In articulation and speech-reading instruction, the power to\r\nassist a class without distracting the attention of the eye from the\r\nvocal organs of the teacher.\r\n\r\nFifth. Freedom of the right hand of the pupil to make instantaneous\r\nreproduction in writing of the matter being received through the sense\r\nof feeling, thereby opening the way for a valuable class exercise.\r\n\r\nSixth. The possible mental stimulus that accompanies the mastery of a\r\nnew language, and the consequent ability to receive known ideas through\r\na new medium.\r\n\r\nSeventh. A fresh variety of class exercises made possible.\r\n\r\nThe writer firmly believes in the good that exists in all methods that\r\nare, or are to be; in the interdependence rather than the independence\r\nof all methods; and in all school-room appliances tending to supplement\r\nor expedite the labors of the teacher, whether they are made of\r\nmaterials delved from the earth or snatched from the clouds.\r\n\r\nS.

THWAITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to approximately ascertain the relative reducing action of\r\nwater gas, carbon monoxide, and superheated steam on iron ore, the\r\nauthor decided to have carried out the following experiments, which were\r\nconducted by Mr. Carl J. Sandahl, of Stockholm, who also carried out the\r\nanalyses. The ore used was from Bilbao, and known as the Ruby Mine, and\r\nwas a good average hematite. The carbonaceous material was the Trimsaran\r\nSouth Wales anthracite, and contained about 90 per cent. of carbon.\r\n\r\nA small experimental furnace was constructed of the form shown by\r\nillustration, about 4 ft. 6 in. high and 2 ft. 3 in. wide at the base,\r\nand gradually swelling to 2 ft. 9 in. at the top, built entirely of\r\nfireclay bricks. Two refractory tubes, 2 in. square internally, and the\r\nheight of the furnace, were used for the double purpose of producing the\r\ngas and reducing the ore.\r\n\r\nThe end of the lower tube rested on a fireclay ladle nozzle, and was\r\nproperly jointed with fireclay; through this nozzle the steam or air was\r\nsupplied to the inside of the refractory tubes. In each experiment the\r\nore and fuel were raised to the temperature \"of from 1,800 to 2,200 deg.\r\nFahr.\" by means of an external fire of anthracite. Great care was taken\r\nto prevent the contact of the solid carbonaceous fuel with the ore. In\r\neach experiment in which steam was used, the latter was supplied at a\r\ntemperature equivalent to 35 lb. to the square inch.\r\n\r\nThe air for producing the carbon monoxide (CO) gas was used at the\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere. As near as possible, the same conditions\r\nwere obtained in each experiment, and the equivalent weight of air was\r\nsent through the carbon to generate the same weight of CO as that\r\ngenerated when steam was used for the production of water gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_First Experiment, Steam (per se)_.--Both tubes, A and B, were filled\r\nwith ore broken to the size of nuts. The tube, A, was heated to about\r\n2,000 deg. Fahr., the upper one to about 1,500 deg.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--In this experiment, part of the steam was dissociated in passing\r\nthrough the turned-up end of the steam supply pipe, which became very\r\nhot, and the steam would form with the iron the magnetic oxide\r\n(Fe_{3}O_{4}). The reduction would doubtless be due to this\r\ndissociation. The pieces of ore found on lowest end of the tube, A, were\r\ndark colored and semi-fused; part of one of these pieces was crushed\r\nfine, and tested; see column I. The remainder of these black pieces was\r\nmixed with the rest of the ore contained in tube, A, and ground and\r\ntested; see column II. The ore in upper tube was all broken up together\r\nand tested; see column III. When finely crushed, the color of No. I. was\r\nbluish black; No. II., a shade darker red; No. III., a little darker\r\nthan the natural color of the ore. The analyses gave:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------+---------+---------+---------\r\n                             |    I.   |   II.   |  III.\r\n                             +---------+---------+---------\r\n                             |per cent.|per cent.|per cent.\r\nFerric oxide (Fe_{2}O_{3}).  |  68.55  |  76.47  |  84.81\r\nFerrous oxide (FeO).         |  16.20  |   9.50  |   1.50\r\n                             +---------+---------+---------\r\n        Total.               |  84.75  |  85.97  |  86.31\r\n                             +---------+---------+---------\r\nCalculated:                  |         |         |\r\nFerric oxide (Fe_{2}O_{3}).  |  32.55  |  55.36  |  81.47\r\nMagnetic oxide (Fe_{3}O_{4}).|  52.20  |  30.61  |   4.84\r\nFerrous oxide (FeO).         |         |         |\r\n                             +---------+---------+---------\r\nTotal.                       |  84.75  |  85.97  |  86.31\r\n                             +---------+---------+---------\r\nPercentage of total\r\n        oxygen reduced.      |   6.93  |   4.02  |   1.07\r\nMetallic iron.               |  60.59  |  60.92  |  60.54\r\n-----------------------------+---------+---------+---------\r\n\r\n_Second Experiment, Water Gas_.--The tube, A, was filled with small\r\npieces of anthracite, and heated until all the volatile matter had been\r\nexpelled.

The work detailed below was well in hand when\r\nMr. MacEwan drew my attention to these and kindly supplied me with the\r\nvolume containing reports of them. Unfortunately, they deal principally\r\nwith the adulterations, while I was more particularly desirous to learn\r\nthe composition in a general way, and especially the percentage of\r\ncoloring resin, the important constituent in commercial annatto. Within\r\nthe last few years it was one of the articles in considerable demand in\r\nthis part of the country; now it is seldom inquired for. This,\r\ncertainly, is not because butter coloring has ceased to be employed, and\r\nhence the reason for regretting that the percentage of resin was not\r\ndealt with in the articles referred to, so that a comparison could have\r\nbeen made between the commercial annatto of that period and that which\r\nexists now. In case some may not be in possession of literature bearing\r\non it--which, by the way, is very meager--it may not be out of place to\r\nquote some short details as to its source, the processes for obtaining\r\nit, the composition of the raw material, and then the method followed in\r\nthe present inquiry will be given, together with the results of the\r\nexamination of ten samples; and though the subject doubtless has more\r\ninterest for the country than for the town druggist, still, I trust it\r\nwill have points of interest for both.\r\n\r\nAnnatto is the coloring matter derived from the seeds of an evergreen\r\nplant, _Bixa Orellana_, which grows in the East and West Indian Islands\r\nand South America, in the latter of which it is principally prepared.\r\nTwo kinds are imported, Spanish annatto, made in Brazil, and flag or\r\nFrench, made mostly in Cayenne. These differ considerably in characters\r\nand properties, the latter having a disagreeable putrescent odor, while\r\nthe Spanish is rather agreeable when fresh and good. It is, however,\r\ninferior to the flag as a coloring or dyeing agent. The seeds from which\r\nthe substance is obtained are red on the outside, and two methods are\r\nfollowed in order to obtain it. One is to rub or wash off the coloring\r\nmatter with water, allow it to subside, and to expose it to spontaneous\r\nevaporation till it acquires a pasty consistence. The other is to bruise\r\nthe seeds, mix them with water, and allow fermentation to set in, during\r\nwhich the coloring matter collects at the bottom, from which it is\r\nsubsequently removed and brought to the proper consistence by\r\nspontaneous evaporation. These particulars, culled from Dr. Redwood's\r\nremarks, may suffice to show its source and the methods for obtaining\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDr. John gives the following as the composition of the pulp surrounding\r\nthe seeds: Coloring resinous matter, 28; vegetable gluten, 26.5;\r\nligneous fiber, 20; coloring, 20; extractive matter, 4; and a trace of\r\nspicy and acid matter.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood, however, that commercial annatto, having\r\nundergone processes necessary to fit it for its various uses, as well as\r\nto preserve it, differs considerably from this; and though it may not be\r\ntrue, as some hint, that manufacturing in this industry is simply a term\r\nsynonymous with adulterating, yet results will afterward be given\r\ntending to show that there are articles in the market which have little\r\nreal claim to the title. I tried, but failed, to procure a sample of raw\r\nmaterial on which to work, with a view to learn something of its\r\ncharacters and properties in this state, and thus be able to contrast it\r\nwith the manufactured or commercial article. The best thing to do in the\r\ncircumstances, I thought, was to operate on the highest priced sample at\r\ndisposal, and this was done in all the different ways that suggested\r\nthemselves. The extraction of the resin by means of alcohol--the usual\r\nway, I believe--was a more troublesome operation than it appeared to be,\r\nas the following experiment will show: One hundred grains of No. 8 were\r\ntaken, dried thoroughly, reduced to fine powder, and introduced into a\r\nflask containing 4 ounces of alcohol in the form of methylated spirit,\r\nboiled for an hour--the flask during the operation being attached to an\r\ninverted condenser--filtered off, and the residue treated with a smaller\r\namount of the spirit and boiled for ten minutes. This was repeated with\r\ndiminishing quantities until in all 14 ounces had been used before the\r\nalcoholic solution ceased to turn blue on the addition to it of strong\r\nsulphuric acid, or failed to give a brownish precipitate with stannous\r\nchloride. As the sample contained a considerable quantity of potassium\r\ncarbonate, in which the resin is soluble, it was thought that by\r\nneutralizing this it might render the resin more easy of extraction.\r\nThis was found to be so, but it was accompanied by such a mass of\r\nextractive as made it in the long run more troublesome, and hence it was\r\nabandoned. Thinking the spirit employed might be too weak, an experiment\r\nwith commercial absolute alcohol was carried out as follows: One hundred\r\ngrains of a red sample, No. 4, were thoroughly dried, powdered finely,\r\nand boiled in 2 ounces of the alcohol, filtered, and the residue treated\r\nwith half an ounce more. This required to be repeated with fresh half\r\nounces of the alcohol until in all 7½ were used; the time occupied from\r\nfirst to last being almost three hours. This was considered\r\nunsatisfactory, besides being very expensive, and so it, also, was set\r\naside, and a series of experiments with methylated spirit alone was set\r\nin hand. The results showed that the easiest and most satisfactory way\r\nwas to take 100 grains (this amount being preferred, as it reduces error\r\nto the minimum), dry thoroughly, powder finely, and macerate with\r\nfrequent agitation for twenty-four hours in a few ounces of spirit, then\r\nto boil in this spirit for a short time, filter, and repeat the boiling\r\nwith a fresh ounce or so; this, as a rule, sufficing to completely\r\nexhaust it of its resin. Wynter Blyth says that the red resin, or bixin,\r\nis soluble in 25 parts of hot alcohol. It appears from these experiments\r\nthat much more is required to dissolve it out of commercial annatto.\r\n\r\nThe full process followed consisted in determining the moisture by\r\ndrying 100 grains at 212° F. till constant, and taking this dried\r\nportion for estimation of the resin in the way just stated. The\r\nalcoholic extract was evaporated to dryness over a water-bath, the\r\nresidue dissolved in solution of sodium carbonate, and the resin\r\nprecipitated by dilute sulphuric acid (these reagents being chosen as\r\nthe best after numerous trials with others), added in the slightest\r\npossible excess. The resin was collected on a tared double filter paper,\r\nwashed with distilled water until the washings were entirely colorless,\r\ndried and weighed.\r\n\r\nThe ash was found in the usual way, and the extractive by the\r\ndifference. In the ash the amount soluble was determined, and\r\nqualitatively examined, as was the insoluble portion in most of them.\r\n\r\nThe results are as follows:\r\n\r\n         |  1.  |  2.  |  3.  |  4.  |  5.  |  6.  |  7.  |  8.  |  9.  |  10.\r\nMoisture | 21.75| 21.60| 20.39| 69.73| 18.00| 18.28| 15.71| 38.18| 19.33| 22.50\r\nResin    |  3.00|  2.90|  1.00|  8.80|  3.00|  1.80|  5.40| 12.00|  5.90|  9.20\r\nExtrac-\r\ntive     | 57.29| 59.33| 65.00| 19.47| 58.40| 65.67| 26.89| 20.82| 23.77| 28.50\r\nAsh      | 17.96| 16.17| 13.61|  2.00| 20.60| 14.25| 52.00| 29.00| 51.00| 39.80\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n         |100.00|100.00|100.00|100.00|100.00|100.00|100.00|100.00|100.00|100.00\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAshes:   |      |      |      |Almost|      |      |      |      |      |\r\nSoluble  | 13.20| 12.57|  7.50|wholly|  10.0| 11.75| 18.5 | 20.0 | 15.0 | 13.8\r\nInsoluble|  4.76|  3.60|  6.11| NaCl.|  10.6|  2.50| 33.5 |  9.0 | 36.0 | 26.0\r\n\r\nThe first six are the ordinary red rolls, with the exception of No. 4,\r\nwhich is a red mass, the only one of this class direct from the\r\nmanufacturers. The remainder are brown cakes, all except No. 7 being\r\nfrom the manufacturers direct. The ash of the first two was largely\r\ncommon salt; that of No. 3 contained, besides this, iron in some\r\nquantity. No. 4 is unique in many respects. It was of a bright red\r\ncolor, and possessed a not disagreeable odor. It contained the largest\r\npercentage of moisture and the lowest of ash; had, comparatively, a\r\nlarge amount of coloring matter; was one of the cheapest, and in the\r\ncourse of some dairy trials, carried out by an intelligent farmer, was\r\npronounced to be the best suited for coloring butter. So far as my\r\nexperience goes, it was a sample of the best commercial excellence,\r\nthough I fear the mass of water present and the absence of preserving\r\nsubstances will assist in its speedy decay. Were such an article easily\r\nprocured in the usual way of business, there would not be much to\r\ncomplain of, but it must not be forgotten that it was got direct from\r\nthe manufacturers--a somewhat suggestive fact when the composition of\r\nsome other samples is taken into account. No. 5 emitted a disagreeable\r\nodor during ignition. The soluble portion of the ash was mostly common\r\nsalt, and the insoluble contained three of sand--the highest amount\r\nfound, although most of the reds contained some. No. 6 was a\r\nvile-looking thing, and when associated in one's mind with butter gave\r\nrise to disagreeable reflections. It was wrapped in a paper saturated\r\nwith a strongly smelling linseed oil. When it was boiled in water and\r\nbroken up, hairs, among other things, were observed floating about. It\r\ncontained some iron. The first cake, No. 7, gave off during ignition an\r\nagreeable odor resembling some of the finer tobaccos, and this is\r\ncharacteristic more or less of all the cakes. The ash weighed 52 per\r\ncent., the soluble part of which, 18.5, was mostly potassium carbonate,\r\nwith some chlorides and sulphates; the insoluble, mostly chalk with iron\r\nand alumina. No. 8--highest priced of all--had in the mass an odor which\r\nI can compare to nothing else than a well rotted farmyard manure. Twenty\r\nparts of the ash were soluble and largely potassium carbonate, the\r\ninsoluble being iron for the most part. The mineral portions of Nos. 9\r\nand 10 closely resemble No. 7.\r\n\r\nOn looking over the results, it is found that the red rolls contained\r\nstarchy matters in abundance (in No. 4 the starch was to a large extent\r\nreplaced by water), and an ash, mostly sodium chloride, introduced no\r\ndoubt to assist in its preservation as well as to increase the color of\r\nthe resin--a well known action of salt on vegetable reds. The cakes,\r\nwhich are mostly used for cheese coloring, I believe, all appeared to\r\ncontain turmeric, for they gave a more or less distinct reaction with\r\nthe boric acid test, and all except No. 8 contained large quantities of\r\nchalk. These results in reference to extractive, etc., reveal nothing\r\nthat has not been known before. Wynter Blyth, who gives the only\r\nanalyses of annatto I have been able to find, states that the\r\ncomposition of a fair commercial sample (which I take to mean the raw\r\narticle) examined by him was as follows: water, 24.2; resin, 28.8; ash,\r\n22.5; and extractive, 24.5; and that of an adulterated (which I take to\r\nmean a manufactured) article, water, 13.4; resin, 11.0; ash (iron,\r\nsilica, chalk, alumina, and common salt), 48.3; and extractive. 27.3. If\r\nthis be correct, it appears that the articles at present in the market,\r\nor at least those which have come in my way, have been wretched\r\nimitations of the genuine thing, and should, instead of being called\r\nadulterated annatto, be called something else adulterated, but not\r\nseriously, with annatto. I have it on the authority of the farmer\r\npreviously referred to, that ¼ of an ounce of No. 4 is amply sufficient\r\nto impart the desired cowslip tint to no less than 60 lb. of butter.\r\nWhen so little is actually required, it does not seem of very serious\r\nimportance whether the adulterant or preservative be flour, chalk, or\r\nwater, but it is exasperating in a very high degree to have such\r\ncompounds as Nos. 3 and 6 palmed off as decent things when even Nos. 1,\r\n2, and 5 have been rejected by dairymen as useless for the purpose. In\r\nconclusion, I may be permitted to express the hope that others may be\r\ninduced to examine the annatto taken into stock more closely than I was\r\ntaught to do, and had been in the habit of doing, namely, to see if it\r\nhad a good consistence and an odor resembling black sugar, for if so,\r\nthe quality was above suspicion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE RICE WINE AND SOJA SAUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor P. Cohn has recently described the mode in which he has\r\nmanufactured the Japanese sake or rice wine in the laboratory. The\r\nmaterial used was \"Tane Kosi,\" i.e., grains of rice coated with the\r\nmycelium, conidiophores, and greenish yellow chains of conidia of\r\n_Aspergillus Oryzoe_. The fermentation is caused by the mycelium of this\r\nfungus before the development of the fructification. The rice is first\r\nexposed to moist air so as to change the starch into paste, and then\r\nmixed with grains of the \"Tane Kosi.\" The whole mass of rice becomes in\r\na short time permeated by the soft white shining mycelium, which imparts\r\nto it the odor of apple or pine-apple. To prevent the production of the\r\nfructification, freshly moistened rice is constantly added for two or\r\nthree days, and then subjected to alcoholic fermentation from the\r\n_Saccharomyces_, which is always present in the rice, but which has\r\nnothing to do with the _Aspergillus_. The fermentation is completed in\r\ntwo or three weeks, and the golden yellow, sherry-like sake is poured\r\noff. The sample manufactured contained 13.9 per cent. of alcohol.\r\nChemical investigation showed that the _Aspergillus_ mycelium transforms\r\nthe starch into glucose, and thus plays the part of a diastase.\r\n\r\nAnother substance produced from the _Aspergillus_ rice is the soja\r\nsauce. The soja leaves, which contain little starch, but a great deal of\r\noil and casein, are boiled, mixed with roasted barley, and then with the\r\ngreenish yellow conidia powder of the _Aspergillus_. After the mycelium\r\nhas fructified, the mass is treated with a solution of sodium chloride,\r\nwhich kills the _Aspergillus_, another fungus, of the nature of a\r\n_Chalaza_, and similar to that produced in the fermentation of\r\n\"sauerkraut,\" appearing in its place. The dark-brown soja sauce then\r\nseparates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALUMINUM.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Annual address delivered by President J.A. Price before the\r\nmeeting of the Scranton Board of Trade, Monday, January 18, 1886.]\r\n\r\nBy J.A. PRICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIron is the basis of our civilization. Its supremacy and power it is\r\nimpossible to overestimate; it enters every avenue of development, and\r\nit may be set down as the prime factor in the world's progress. Its\r\nutility and its universality are hand in hand, whether in the\r\nmagnificent iron steamship of the ocean, the network of iron rail upon\r\nland, the electric gossamer of the air, or in the most insignificant\r\narticles of building, of clothing, and of convenience. Without it, we\r\nshould have miserably failed to reach our present exalted station, and\r\nthe earth would scarcely maintain its present population; it is indeed\r\nthe substance of substances. It is the Archimedean lever by which the\r\ngreat human world has been raised. Should it for a moment forget its\r\ncunning and lose its power, earthquake shocks or the wreck of matter\r\ncould not be more disastrous. However axiomatic may be everything that\r\ncan be said of this wonderful metal, it is undoubtedly certain that it\r\nmust give way to a metal that has still greater proportions and vaster\r\npossibilities. Strange and startling as may seem the assertion, yet I\r\nbelieve it nevertheless to be true that we are approaching the period,\r\nif not already standing upon the threshold of the day, when this magical\r\nelement will be radically supplanted, and when this valuable mineral\r\nwill be as completely superseded as the stone of the aborigines. With\r\nall its apparent potency, it has its evident weaknesses; moisture is\r\neverywhere at war with it, gases and temperature destroy its fiber and\r\nits life, continued blows or motion crystallize and rob it of its\r\nstrength, and acids will devour it in a night. If it be possible to\r\neliminate all, or even one or more, of these qualities of weakness in\r\nany metal, still preserving both quantity and quality, that metal will\r\nbe the metal of the future.\r\n\r\nThe coming metal, then, to which our reference is made is aluminum, the\r\nmost abundant metal in the earth's crust. Of all substances, oxygen is\r\nthe most abundant, constituting about one-half; after oxygen comes\r\nsilicon, constituting about one-fourth, with aluminum third in all the\r\nlist of substances of the composition. Leaving out of consideration the\r\nconstituents of the earth's center, whether they be molten or gaseous,\r\nmore or less dense as the case may be, as we approach it, and confining\r\nourselves to the only practical phase of the subject, the crust, we find\r\nthat aluminum is beyond question the most abundant and the most useful\r\nof all metallic substances.\r\n\r\nIt is the metallic base of mica, feldspar, slate, and clay. Professor\r\nDana says: \"Nearly all the rocks except limestones and many sandstones\r\nare literally ore-beds of the metal aluminum.\" It appears in the gem,\r\nassuming a blue in the sapphire, green in the emerald, yellow in the\r\ntopaz, red in the ruby, brown in the emery, and so on to the white,\r\ngray, blue, and black of the slates and clays. It has been dubbed \"clay\r\nmetal\" and \"silver made from clay;\" also when mixed with any\r\nconsiderable quantity of carbon becoming a grayish or bluish black \"alum\r\nslate.\"\r\n\r\nThis metal in color is white and next in luster to silver. It has never\r\nbeen found in a pure state, but is known to exist in combination with\r\nnearly two hundred different minerals. Corundum and pure emery are ores\r\nthat are very rich in aluminum, containing about fifty-four per cent.\r\nThe specific gravity is but two and one-half times that of water; it is\r\nlighter than glass or as light as chalk, being only one-third the weight\r\nof iron and one-fourth the weight of silver; it is as malleable as gold,\r\ntenacious as iron, and harder than steel, being next the diamond. Thus\r\nit is capable of the widest variety of uses, being soft when ductility,\r\nfibrous when tenacity, and crystalline when hardness is required. Its\r\nvariety of transformations is something wonderful. Meeting iron, or even\r\niron at its best in the form of steel, in the same field, it easily\r\nvanquishes it at every point. It melts at 1,300 degrees F., or at least\r\n600 degrees below the melting point of iron, and it neither oxidizes in\r\nthe atmosphere nor tarnishes in contact with gases. The enumeration of\r\nthe properties of aluminum is as enchanting as the scenes of a fairy\r\ntale.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further with this new wonder of science, which is\r\nalready knocking at our doors, a brief sketch of its birth and\r\ndevelopment may be fittingly introduced. The celebrated French chemist\r\nLavoisier, a very magician in the science, groping in the dark of the\r\nlast century, evolved the chemical theory of combustion--the existence\r\nof a \"highly respirable gas,\" oxygen, and the presence of metallic bases\r\nin earths and alkalies. With the latter subject we have only to do at\r\nthe present moment. The metallic base was predicted, yet not identified.\r\nThe French Revolution swept this genius from the earth in 1794, and\r\ndarkness closed in upon the scene, until the light of Sir Humphry Davy's\r\nlamp in the early years of the present century again struck upon the\r\nmetallic base of certain earths, but the reflection was so feeble that\r\nthe great secret was never revealed. Then a little later the Swedish\r\nBerzelius and the Danish Oersted, confident in the prediction of\r\nLavoisier and of Davy, went in search of the mysterious stranger with\r\nthe aggressive electric current, but as yet to no purpose. It was\r\nreserved to the distinguished German Wohler, in 1827, to complete the\r\nwork of the past fifty years of struggle and finally produce the minute\r\nwhite globule of the pure metal from a mixture of the chloride of\r\naluminum and sodium, and at last the secret is revealed--the first step\r\nwas taken. It took twenty years of labor to revolve the mere discovery\r\ninto the production of the aluminum bead in 1846, and yet with this\r\nfirst step, this new wonder remained a foetus undeveloped in the womb of\r\nthe laboratory for years to come.\r\n\r\nReturning again to France some time during the years between 1854 and\r\n1858, and under the patronage of the Emperor Napoleon III., we behold\r\nDeville at last forcing Nature to yield and give up this precious\r\nquality as a manufactured product. Rose, of Berlin, and Gerhard, in\r\nEngland, pressing hard upon the heels of the Frenchman, make permanent\r\nthe new product in the market at thirty-two dollars per pound. The\r\ndespair of three-quarters of a century of toilsome pursuit has been\r\nbroken, and the future of the metal has been established.\r\n\r\nThe art of obtaining the metal since the period under consideration has\r\nprogressed steadily by one process after another, constantly increasing\r\nin powers of productivity and reducing the cost. These arts are\r\nintensely interesting to the student, but must be denied more than a\r\nreference at this time. The price of the metal may be said to have come\r\nwithin the reach of the manufacturing arts already.\r\n\r\nA present glance at the uses and possibilities of this wonderful metal,\r\nits application and its varying quality, may not be out of place. Its\r\nalloys are very numerous and always satisfactory; with iron, producing a\r\ncomparative rust proof; with copper, the beautiful golden bronze, and so\r\non, embracing the entire list of articles of usefulness as well as works\r\nof art, jewelry, and scientific instruments.\r\n\r\nIts capacity to resist oxidation or rust fits it most eminently for all\r\nhousehold and cooking utensils, while its color transforms the dark\r\nvisaged, disagreeable array of pots, pans, and kitchen implements into\r\nthings of comparative beauty. As a metal it surpasses copper, brass, and\r\ntin in being tasteless and odorless, besides being stronger than either.\r\n\r\nIt has, as we have seen, bulk without weight, and consequently may be\r\navailable in construction of furniture and house fittings, as well in\r\nthe multitudinous requirements of architecture. The building art will\r\nexperience a rapid and radical change when this material enters as a\r\ncomponent material, for there will be possibilities such as are now\r\nundreamed of in the erection of homes, public buildings, memorial\r\nstructures, etc. etc., for in this metal we have the strength,\r\ndurability, and the color to give all the variety that genius may\r\ndictate.\r\n\r\nAnd when we take a still further survey of the vast field that is\r\nopening before us, we find in the strength without size a most desirable\r\nassistant in all the avenues of locomotion. It is the ideal metal for\r\nrailway traffic, for carriages and wagons. The steamships of the ocean\r\nof equal size will double their cargo and increase the speed of the\r\npresent greyhounds of the sea, making six days from shore to shore seem\r\nindeed an old time calculation and accomplishment. A thinner as well as\r\na lighter plate; a smaller as well as a stronger engine; a larger as\r\nwell as a less hazardous propeller; and a natural condition of\r\nresistance to the action of the elements; will make travel by water a\r\nforcible rival to the speed attained upon land, and bring all the\r\ndistant countries in contact with our civilization, to the profit of\r\nall. This metal is destined to annihilate space even beyond the dream of\r\nphilosopher or poet.\r\n\r\nThe tensile strength of this material is something equally wonderful,\r\nwhen wire drawn reaches as high as 128,000 pounds, and under other\r\nconditions reaches nearly if not quite 100,000 pounds to the square\r\ninch. The requirements of the British and German governments in the best\r\nwrought steel guns reach only a standard of 70,000 pounds to the square\r\ninch. Bridges may be constructed that shall be lighter than wooden ones\r\nand of greater strength than wrought steel and entirely free from\r\ncorrosion. The time is not distant when the modern wonder of the\r\nBrooklyn span will seem a toy.\r\n\r\nIt may also be noted that this metal affords wide development in\r\nplumbing material, in piping, and will render possible the almost\r\nindefinite extension of the coming feature of communication and\r\nexchange--the pneumatic tube.\r\n\r\nThe resistance to corrosion evidently fits this metal for railway\r\nsleepers to take the place of the decaying wooden ties. In this metal\r\nthe sleeper may be made as soft and yielding as lead, while the rail may\r\nbe harder and tougher than steel, thus at once forming the necessary\r\ncushion and the avoidance of jar and noise, at the same time\r\ncontributing to additional security in virtue of a stronger rail.\r\n\r\nIn conductivity this metal is only exceeded by copper, having many times\r\nthat of iron. Thus in telegraphy there are renewed prospects in the\r\nsupplanting of the galvanized iron wire--lightness, strength, and\r\ndurability. When applied to the generation of steam, this material will\r\nenable us to carry higher pressure at a reduced cost and increased\r\nsafety, as this will be accomplished by the thinner plate, the greater\r\nconductivity of heat, and the better fiber.\r\n\r\nIt is said that some of its alloys are without a rival as an\r\nanti-friction metal, and having hardness and toughness, fits it\r\nremarkably for bearings and journals. Herein a vast possibility in the\r\nmechanic art lies dormant--the size of the machine may be reduced, the\r\nspeed and the power increased, realizing the conception of two things\r\nbetter done than one before. It is one of man's creative acts.\r\n\r\nFrom other of its alloys, knives, axes, swords, and all cutting\r\nimplements may receive and hold an edge not surpassed by the best\r\ntempered steel. Hulot, director in the postage stamp department, Paris,\r\nasserts that 120,000 blows will exhaust the usefulness of the cushion of\r\nthe stamp machine, and this number of blows is given in a day; and that\r\nwhen a cushion of aluminum bronze was substituted, it was unaffected\r\nafter months of use.\r\n\r\nIf we have found a metal that possesses both tensile strength and\r\nresistance to compression; malleability and ductility--the quality of\r\nhardening, softening, and toughening by tempering; adaptability to\r\ncasting, rolling, or forging; susceptibility to luster and finish; of\r\ncomplete homogeneous character and unusually resistant to destructive\r\nagents--mankind will certainly leave the present accomplishments as\r\nbelonging to an effete past, and, as it were, start anew in a career of\r\ngreater prospects.\r\n\r\nThis important material is to be found largely in nearly all the rocks,\r\nor as Prof. Dana has said, \"Nearly all rocks are ore-beds of the metal.\"\r\nIt is in every clay bank. It is particularly abundant in the coal\r\nmeasures and is incidental to the shales or slates and clays that\r\nunderlie the coal. This under clay of the coal stratum was in all\r\nprobability the soil out of which grew the vegetation of the coal\r\ndeposits. It is a compound of aluminum and other matter, and, when mixed\r\nwith carbon and transformed by the processes of geologic action, it\r\nbecomes the shale rock which we know and which we discard as worthless\r\nslate. And it is barely possible that we have been and are still carting\r\nto the refuse pile an article more valuable than the so greatly lauded\r\ncoal waste or the merchantable coal itself. We have seen that the best\r\nalumina ore contains only fifty-four per cent. of metal.\r\n\r\nThe following prepared table has been furnished by the courtesy and\r\nkindness of Mr. Alex. H. Sherred, of Scranton.\r\n\r\n               ALUMINA.\r\n\r\nBlue-black shale, Pine Brook drift                            27.36\r\nSlate from Briggs' Shaft coal                                 15.93\r\nBlack fire clay, 4 ft. thick, Nos. 4 and 5 Rolling Mill mines 23.53\r\nFirst cut on railroad, black clay above Rolling Mill          32.60\r\nG vein black clay, Hyde Park mines                            28.67\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the black clay, shale, or slate, has a constituent\r\nof aluminum of from 15.93 per cent., the lowest, to 32.60 per cent., the\r\nhighest. Under every stratum of coal, and frequently mixed with it, are\r\nthese under deposits that are rich in the metal. When exposed to the\r\natmosphere, these shales yield a small deposit of alum. In the\r\nmanufacture of alum near Glasgow the shale and slate clay from the old\r\ncoal pits constitute the material used, and in France alum is\r\nmanufactured directly from the clay.\r\n\r\nSufficient has been advanced to warrant the additional assertion that we\r\nare here everywhere surrounded by this incomparable mineral, that it is\r\nbrought to the surface from its deposits deep in the earth by the\r\nnatural process in mining, and is only exceeded in quantity by the coal\r\nitself. Taking a columnar section of our coal field, and computing the\r\nthickness of each shale stratum, we have from twenty-five to sixty feet\r\nin thickness of this metal-bearing substance, which averages over\r\ntwenty-five per cent. of the whole in quantity in metal.\r\n\r\nIt is readily apparent that the only task now before us is the reduction\r\nof the ore and the extraction of the metal. Can this be done? We answer,\r\nit has been done. The egg has stood on end--the new world has been\r\nsighted. All that now remains is to repeat the operation and extend the\r\nprocess. Cheap aluminum will revolutionize industry, travel, comfort,\r\nand indulgence, transforming the present into an even greater\r\ncivilization. Let us see.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the discovery of the mere chemical existence of the metal,\r\nwe have stood by the birth of the first white globule or bead by Wohler,\r\nin 1846, and witnesssed its introduction as a manufactured product in\r\n1855, since which time, by the alteration and cheapening of one process\r\nafter another, it has fallen in price from thirty-two dollars per pound\r\nin 1855 to fifteen dollars per pound in 1885. Thirty years of persistent\r\nlabor at smelting have increased the quantity over a thousandfold and\r\nreduced the cost upward of fifty per cent.\r\n\r\nAll these processes involve the application of heat--a mere question of\r\nthe appliances. The electric currents of Berzelius and Oersted, the\r\ncrucible of Wohler, the closed furnaces and the hydrogen gas of the\r\nFrench manufacturers and the Bessemer converter apparatus of Thompson,\r\nall indicate one direction. This metal can be made to abandon its bed in\r\nthe earth and the rock at the will of man. During the past year, the\r\nMessrs. Cowles, of Cleveland, by their electric smelting process, claim\r\nto have made it possible to reduce the price of the metal to below four\r\ndollars per pound; and there is now erecting at Lockport, New York, a\r\nplant involving one million of capital for the purpose.\r\n\r\nTurning from the employment of the expensive reducing agents to the\r\nsimple and sole application of heat, we are unwilling to believe that we\r\ndo not here possess in eminence both the mineral and the medium of its\r\nreduction. Whether the electric or the reverberatory or the converter\r\nfurnace system be employed, it is surely possible to produce the result.\r\n\r\nTo enter into consideration of the details of these constructions would\r\ninvolve more time than is permitted us on this occasion. They are very\r\ninteresting. We come again naturally to the limitless consideration of\r\npowdered fuel, concerning which certain conclusions have been reached.\r\nIn the dissociation of water into its hydrogen and oxygen, with the\r\nmingled carbon in a powdered state, we undoubtedly possess the elements\r\nof combustion that are unexcelled on earth, a heat-producing combination\r\nthat in both activity and power leaves little to be desired this side of\r\nthe production of the electric force and heat directly from the carbon\r\nwithout the intermediary of boilers, engines, dynamos, and furnaces.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of stimulating thought to this infinite question of proper\r\nfuel combustion, with its attendant possibilities for man's\r\ngratification and ambition, this advanced step is presented. The\r\ndiscussion of processes will require an amount of time which I hope this\r\nBoard will not grudgingly devote to the subject, but which is impossible\r\nat present. Do not forget that there is no single spot on the face of\r\nthe globe where nature has lavished more freely her choicest gifts. Let\r\nus be active in the pursuit of the treasure and grateful for the\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF METEORITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 9, Professor Dewar delivered the sixth and last of his series\r\nof lectures at the Royal Institution on \"The Story of a Meteorite.\" [For\r\nthe preceding lectures, see SUPPLEMENTS 529 and 580.] He said that\r\ncosmic dust is found on Arctic snows and upon the bottom of the ocean;\r\nall over the world, in fact, at some time or other, there has been a\r\nlarge deposit of this meteoric dust, containing little round nodules\r\nfound also in meteorites. In Greenland some time ago numbers of what\r\nwere supposed to be meteoric stones were found; they contained iron, and\r\nthis iron, on being analyzed at Copenhagen, was found to be rich in\r\nnickel. The Esquimaux once made knives from iron containing nickel; and\r\nas any such alloy they must have found and not manufactured, it was\r\nsupposed to be of meteoric origin. Some young physicists visited the\r\nbasaltic coast in Greenland from which some of the supposed meteoric\r\nstones had been brought, and in the middle of the rock large nodules\r\nwere found composed of iron and nickel; it, therefore, became evident\r\nthat the earth might produce masses not unlike such as come to us as\r\nmeteorites. The lecturer here exhibited a section of the Greenland rock\r\ncontaining the iron, and nickel alloy, mixed with stony crystals, and\r\nits resemblance to a section of a meteorite was obvious. It was 2½ times\r\ndenser than water, yet the whole earth is 5½ times denser than water, so\r\nthat if we could go deep enough, it is not improbable that our own globe\r\nmight be found to contain something like meteoric iron. He then called\r\nattention to the following tables:\r\n\r\n  _Elementary Substances found in Meteorites_.\r\n\r\n  Hydrogen.       Chromium.       Arsenic.\r\n  Lithium.        Manganese.      Vanadium?\r\n  Sodium.         Iron.           Phosphorus.\r\n  Potassium.      Nickel.         Sulphur.\r\n  Magnesium.      Cobalt.         Oxygen.\r\n  Calcium.        Copper.         Silicon.\r\n  Aluminum.       Tin.            Carbon.\r\n  Titanium.       Antimony.       Chlorine.\r\n\r\n_Density of Meteorites_.\r\n\r\n  Carbonaceous (Orgueil, etc.)     1.9 to 3\r\n  Aluminous (Java)                 3.0  \" 3.2\r\n  Peridotes (Chassigny, etc.)      3.5  \" --\r\n  Ordinary type (Saint Mes)        3.1  \" 3.8\r\n  Rich in iron (Sierra de Chuco)   6.5  \" 7.0\r\n  Iron with stone (Krasnoyarsk)    7.1  \" 7.8\r\n  True irons (Caille)              7.0  \" 8.0\r\n\r\n_Interior of the Earth_\r\n\r\n  Parts\r\n  of the\r\n  radius.

Although thousands upon thousands of such small meteors have\r\npassed through our atmosphere, there is no distinct record of one having\r\never fallen to the earth during these annual displays. One was said to\r\nhave fallen recently at Naples, but on investigation it turned out to be\r\na myth. These annual meteors in the upper air are supposed to be only\r\nsmall ones, and to be dissipated into dust and vapor at the time of\r\ntheir sudden heating; so numerous are they that 40,000 have been counted\r\nin one evening, and an exceptionally great display comes about once in\r\n33¼ years. The inference from their periodicity is, that they are small\r\nbodies moving round the sun in orbits of their own, and that whenever\r\nthe earth crosses their orbits, thereby getting into their path, a\r\nsplendid display of meteors results. A second display, a year later,\r\nusually follows the exceptionally great display just mentioned,\r\nconsequently the train of meteors is of great length. Some of these\r\nmeteors just enter the atmosphere of the earth, then pass out again\r\nforever, with their direction of motion altered by the influence of the\r\nattraction of the earth. He here called attention to the accompanying\r\ndiagram of the orbits of meteors.\r\n\r\nThe lecturer next invited attention to a hollow globe of linen or some\r\nlight material; it was about 2 ft. or 2 ft. 6 in. in diameter, and\r\ncontained hidden within it the great electro-magnet, weighing 2 cwt., so\r\noften used by Faraday in his experiments. He also exhibited a ball made\r\npartly of thin iron; the globe represented the earth, for the purposes\r\nof the experiment, and the ball a meteorite of somewhat large relative\r\nsize. The ball was then discharged at the globe from a little catapult;\r\nsometimes the globe attracted the ball to its surface, and held it\r\nthere, sometimes it missed it, but altered its curve of motion through\r\nthe air. So was it, said the lecturer, with meteorites when they neared\r\nthe earth. Photographs from drawings, by Professor A. Herschel, of the\r\npaths of meteors as seen by night were projected on the screen; they all\r\nseemed to emanate from one radiant point, which, said the lecturer, is a\r\nproof that their motions are parallel to each other; the parallel lines\r\nseem to draw to a point at the greatest distance, for the same reason\r\nthat the rails of a straight line of railway seem to come from a distant\r\ncentral point. The most interesting thing about the path of a company of\r\nmeteors is, that a comet is known to move in the same orbit; the comet\r\nheads the procession, the meteors follow, and they are therefore, in all\r\nprobability, parts of comets, although everything about these difficult\r\nmatters cannot as yet be entirely explained; enough, however, is known\r\nto give foundation for the assumption that meteorites and comets are not\r\nvery dissimilar.\r\n\r\nThe light of a meteorite is not seen until it enters the atmosphere of\r\nthe earth, but falling meteorites can be vaporized by electricity, and\r\nthe light emitted by their constituents be then examined with the\r\nspectroscope. The light of comets can be directly examined, and it\r\nreveals the presence in those bodies of sodium, carbon, and a few other\r\nwell-known substances. He would put a piece of meteorite in the electric\r\narc to see what light it would give; he had never tried the experiment\r\nbefore. The lights of the theater were then turned down, and the\r\ndiscourse was continued in darkness; among the most prominent lines\r\nvisible in the spectrum of the meteorite, Professor Dewar specified\r\nmagnesium, sodium, and lithium. \"Where do meteorites come from?\" said\r\nthe lecturer. It might be, he continued, that they were portions of\r\nexploded planets, or had been ejected from planets. In this relation, he\r\nshould like to explain the modern idea of the possible method of\r\nconstruction of our own earth. He then set forth the nebular hypothesis\r\nthat at some long past time our sun and all his planets existed but as a\r\nvolume of gas, which in contracting and cooling formed a hot volume of\r\nrotating liquid, and that as this further contracted and cooled, the\r\nplanets, and moons, and planetary rings fell off from it and gradually\r\nsolidified, the sun being left as the solitary comparatively uncooled\r\nportion of the original nebula. In partial illustration of this, he\r\ncaused a little globe of oil, suspended in an aqueous liquid of nearly\r\nits own specific gravity, to rotate, and as it rotated it was seen, by\r\nmeans of its magnified image upon the screen, to throw off from its\r\nouter circumference rings and little globes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDELABRA CACTUS AND CALIFORNIA WOODPECKER.\r\n\r\nBy C.F. HOLDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most picturesque objects that meet the eye of the traveler\r\nover the great plains of the southern portion of California and New\r\nMexico is the candelabra cactus. Systematically it belongs to the Cereus\r\nfamily, in which the notable Night-blooming Cereus also is naturally\r\nincluded. In tropical or semi-tropical countries these plants thrive,\r\nand grow to enormous size. For example, the Cereus that bears those\r\ngreat flowers, and blooms at night, exhaling powerful perfume, as we see\r\nthem in hothouses in our cold climate, are even in the semi-tropical\r\nregion of Key West, on the Florida Reef, seen to grow enormously in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CANDELABRA CACTUS--CEREUS GIGANTEUS.]\r\n\r\nWe cultivated several species of the more interesting forms during a\r\nresidence on the reef. Our brick house, two stories in height, was\r\nentirely covered on a broad gable end, the branches more than gaining\r\nthe top. There is a regular monthly growth, and this is indicated by a\r\njoint between each two lengths. Should the stalk be allowed to grow\r\nwithout support, it will continue growing without division, and exhibit\r\nstalks five or six feet in length, when they droop, and fall upon the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWhere there is a convenient resting place on which it can spread out and\r\nattach itself, the stalk throws out feelers and rootlets, which fasten\r\nsecurely to the wall or brickwork; then, this being a normal growth,\r\nthere is a separation at intervals of about a foot. That is, the stalk\r\ngrows in one month about twelve inches, and if it has support, the\r\nmiddle woody stalk continues to grow about an inch further, but has no\r\ngreen, succulent portion, in fact, looks like a stem; then the other\r\nmonthly growth takes place, and ends with a stem, and so on\r\nindefinitely. Our house was entirely covered by the stems of such a\r\nplant, and the flowers were gorgeous in the extreme. The perfume,\r\nhowever, was so potent that it became a nuisance. Such is the\r\nNight-blooming Cereus in the warm climates, and similarly the Candelabra\r\nCereus grows in stalks, but architecturally erect, fluted like columns.\r\nThe flowers are large, and resemble those of the night-blooming variety.\r\nSome columns remain single, and are amazingly artificial appearing;\r\nothers throw off shoots, as seen in the picture. There are some smaller\r\nvarieties that have even more of a candelabra look, there being clusters\r\nof side shoots, the latter putting out from the trunk regularly, and\r\nstanding up parallel to each other. The enormous size these attain is\r\nwell shown in the picture.\r\n\r\nWhenever the great stalks of these cacti die, the succulent portion is\r\ndried, and nothing is left but the woody fiber. They are hollow in\r\nplaces, and easily penetrated. A species of woodpecker, _Melanerpes\r\nformicivorus_, is found to have adopted the use of these dry stalks for\r\nstoring the winter's stock of provisions. There are several round\r\napertures seen on the stems in the pictures, which were pecked by this\r\nbird. This species of woodpecker is about the size of our common robin\r\nor migratory thrush, and has a bill stout and sharp. The holes are\r\npecked for the purpose of storing away acorns or other nuts; they are\r\njust large enough to admit the fruit, while the cup or larger end\r\nremains outside. The nuts are forced in, so that it requires\r\nconsiderable wrenching to dislodge them. In many instances the nuts are\r\nso numerous, the stalk has the appearance of being studded with bullets.\r\nThis appearance is more pronounced in cases where the dead trunk of an\r\noak is used. There are some specimens of the latter now owned by the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History, which were originally sent to the\r\nCentennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. They were placed in the\r\ndepartment contributed by the Pacific Railroad Company, and at that time\r\nwere regarded as some of the wonders of that newly explored region\r\nthrough which the railroad was then penetrating. Some portions of the\r\nsurface of these logs are nearly entirely occupied by the holes with\r\nacorns in them. The acorns are driven in very tightly in these examples;\r\nmuch more so than in the cactus plants, as the oak is nearly round, and\r\nthe holes were pecked in solid though dead wood. One of the most\r\nremarkable circumstances connected with this habit of the woodpecker is\r\nthe length of flight required and accomplished. At Mount Pizarro, where\r\nsuch storehouses are found, the nearest oak trees are in the\r\nCordilleras, thirty miles distant; thus the birds are obliged to make a\r\njourney of sixty miles to accomplish the storing of one acorn. At first\r\nit seemed strange that a bird should spend so much labor to place those\r\nbits of food, and so far away. De Saussure, a Swiss naturalist,\r\npublished in the _Bibliotheque Universelle_, of Geneva, entertaining\r\naccounts of the Mexican Colaptes, a variety of the familiar \"high hold,\"\r\nor golden winged woodpecker. They were seen to store acorns in the dead\r\nstalks of the maguey (_Agave Americana_). Sumichrast, who accompanied\r\nhim to Central America, records the same facts. These travelers saw\r\ngreat numbers of the woodpeckers in a region on the slope of a range of\r\nvolcanic mountains. There was little else of vegetation than the\r\n_Agave_, whose barren, dead stems were studded with acorns placed there\r\nby the woodpeckers.\r\n\r\nThe maguey throws up a stalk about fifteen feet in height yearly, which,\r\nafter flowering, grows stalky and brittle, and remains an unsightly\r\nthing. The interior is pithy, but after the death of the stalk the pith\r\ncontracts, and leaves the greater portion of the interior hollow, as we\r\nhave seen in the case of the cactus branches. How the birds found that\r\nthese stalks were hollow is a problem not yet solved, but, nevertheless,\r\nthey take the trouble to peck away at the hard bark, and once\r\npenetrated, they commence to fill the interior; when one space is full,\r\nthe bird pecks a little higher up, and so continues.\r\n\r\nDr. Heerman, of California, describes the California _Melanerpes_ as one\r\nof the most abundant of the woodpeckers; and remarks that it catches\r\ninsects on the wing like a flycatcher. It is well determined that it\r\nalso eats the acorns that it takes so much pains to transport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOWER OF CEREUS GIGANTEUS.]\r\n\r\nIt seems that these birds also store the pine trees, as well as the\r\noaks. It is not quite apparent why these birds exhibit such variation in\r\nhabits; they at times select the more solid trees, where the storing\r\ncannot go on without each nut is separately set in a hole of its own.\r\nThere seems an instinct prompting them to do this work, though there may\r\nnot be any of the nuts touched again by the birds. Curiously enough,\r\nthere are many instances of the birds placing pebbles instead of nuts in\r\nholes they have purposely pecked for them. Serious trouble has been\r\nexperienced by these pebbles suddenly coming in contact with the saw of\r\nthe mill through which the tree is running. The stone having been placed\r\nin a living tree, as is often the case, its exterior had been lost to\r\nsight during growth.\r\n\r\nSome doubt has been entertained about the purpose of the bird in storing\r\nthe nuts in this manner. De Saussure tells us he has witnessed the birds\r\neating the acorns after they had been placed in holes in trees, and\r\nexpresses his conviction that the insignificant grub which is only seen\r\nin a small proportion of nuts is not the food they are in search of.\r\n\r\nC.W. Plass, Esq., of Napa City, California, had an interesting example\r\nof the habits of the California _Melanerpes_ displayed in his own house.\r\nThe birds had deposited numbers of acorns in the gable end. A\r\nconsiderable number of shells were found dropped underneath the eaves,\r\nwhile some were found in place under the gable, and these were perfect,\r\nhaving no grubs in them.\r\n\r\nThe picture shows a very common scene in New Mexico. The columns,\r\nstraight and angular, are often sixty feet in height. It is called torch\r\ncactus in some places. There are many varieties, and as many different\r\nshapes. Some lie on the ground; others, attached to trunks of trees as\r\nparasites, hang from branches like great serpents; but none is so\r\nmajestic as the species called systematically _Cereus giganteus_, most\r\nappropriately. The species growing pretty abundantly on the island of\r\nKey West is called candle cactus. It reaches some ten or twelve feet,\r\nand is about three inches in diameter. The angles are not so prominent,\r\nwhich gives the cylinders a roundish appearance. They form a pretty,\r\nrather picturesque feature in the otherwise barren undergrowth of\r\nshrubbery and small trees. Accompanied by a few flowering cocoa palms,\r\nthe view is not unpleasing. The fiber of these plants is utilized in\r\nsome coarse manufactures. The maguey, or Agave, is used in the\r\nmanufacture of fine roping. Manila hemp is made from a species. The\r\nspecies whose dried stalks are used by the woodpeckers for their winter\r\nstorage was cultivated at Key West, Florida, during several years before\r\n1858. Extensive fields of the Agave stood unappropriated at that period.\r\nConsiderable funds were dissipated on this venture. Extensive works were\r\nestablished, and much confidence was entertained that the scheme would\r\nprove a paying one, but the \"hemp\" rope which this was intended to rival\r\ncould be made cheaper than this. The great Agave plants, with their long\r\nstalks, stand now, increasing every year, until a portion of the island\r\nis overrun with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREUS GIGANTEUS.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful cactus, its colossal proportions, and weird, yet grand,\r\nappearance in the rocky regions of Mexico and California, where it is\r\nfound in abundance, have been made known to us only through books of\r\ntravel, no large plants of it having as yet appeared in cultivation in\r\nthis country. It is questionable if ever the natural desire to see such\r\na vegetable curiosity represented by a large specimen in gardens like\r\nKew can be realized, owing to the difficulty of importing large stems in\r\na living condition; and even if successfully brought here, they survive\r\nonly a very short time. To grow young plants to a large size seems\r\nequally beyond our power, as plants 6 inches high and carefully managed\r\nare quite ten years old. When young, the stem is globose, afterward\r\nbecoming club-shaped or cylindrical. It flowers at the height of 12\r\nfeet, but grows up to four or five times that height, when it develops\r\nlateral branches, which curve upward and present the appearance of an\r\nimmense candelabrum, the base of the stem being as thick as a man's\r\nbody. The flower, of which a figure is given here, is about 5 inches\r\nlong and wide, the petals cream colored, the sepals greenish white.\r\nLarge clusters of flowers are developed together near the top of the\r\nstem. A richly colored edible fruit like a large fig succeeds each\r\nflower, and this is gathered by the natives and used as food under the\r\nname of saguarro. A specimen of this cactus 3 feet high may be seen in\r\nthe succulent house at Kew.--_B., The Garden_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW PLANTS ARE REPRODUCED.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Read at a meeting of the Chemists' Assistants' Association.\r\nDecember 16, 1885.]\r\n\r\nBy C.E. STUART, B.Sc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn two previous papers read before this Association I have tried to\r\ncondense into as small a space as I could the processes of the nutrition\r\nand of the growth of plants; in the present paper I want to set before\r\nyou the broad lines of the methods by which plants are reproduced.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the great trees of the conifers and the dicotyledons we have\r\napparently provision for growth for any number of years, or even\r\ncenturies, yet accident or decay, or one of the many ills that plants\r\nare heirs to, will sooner or later put an end to the life of every\r\nindividual plant.\r\n\r\nHence the most important act of a plant--not for itself perhaps, but for\r\nits race--is the act by which it, as we say, \"reproduces itself,\" that\r\nis, the act which results in the giving of life to a second individual\r\nof the same form, structure, and nature as the original plant.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which it is secured that the second generation of the\r\nplant shall be as well or even better fitted for the struggle of life\r\nthan the parent generation are so numerous and complicated that I cannot\r\nin this paper do more than allude to them; they are most completely seen\r\nin cross fertilization, and the adaptation of plant structures to that\r\nend.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to point out at present are the principles and not so much\r\nthe details of reproduction, and I wish you to notice, as I proceed,\r\nwhat is true not only of reproduction in plants but also of all\r\nprocesses in nature, namely, the paucity of typical methods of attaining\r\nthe given end, and the multiplicity of special variation from those\r\ntypical methods. When we see the wonderfully varied forms of plant life,\r\nand yet learn that, so to speak, each edifice is built with the same\r\nkind of brick, called a cell, modified in form and function; when we see\r\nthe smallest and simplest equally with the largest and most complicated\r\nplant increasing in size subject to the laws of growth by\r\nintussusception and cell division, which are universal in the organic\r\nworld; we should not be surprised if all the methods by which plants are\r\nreproduced can be reduced to a very small number of types.\r\n\r\nThe first great generalization is into--\r\n\r\n1. The vegetative type of reproduction, in which one or more ordinary\r\ncells separate from the parent plant and become an independent plant;\r\nand--\r\n\r\n2. The special-cell type of reproduction, in which either one special\r\ncell reproduces the plant, or two special cells by their union form the\r\norigin of the new plant; these two modifications of the process are\r\nknown respectively as asexual and sexual.\r\n\r\nThe third modification is a combination of the two others, namely, the\r\nasexual special cell does not directly reproduce its parent form, but\r\ngives rise to a structure in which sexual special cells are developed,\r\nfrom whose coalescence springs again the likeness of the original plant.\r\nThis is termed alternation of generations.\r\n\r\nThe sexual special cell is termed the _spore_.\r\n\r\nThe sexual special cells are of one kind or of two kinds.\r\n\r\nThose which are of one kind may be termed, from their habit of yoking\r\nthemselves together, _zygoblasts_, or conjugating cells.\r\n\r\nThose which are of two kinds are, first, a generally aggressive and\r\nmotile fertilizing or so-called \"male cell,\" called in its typical form\r\nan _antherozoid_; and, second, a passive and motionless receptive or\r\nso-called \"female cell,\" called an _oosphere_.\r\n\r\nThe product of the union of two zygoblasts is termed a _zygospore_.\r\n\r\nThe product of the union of an antherozoid and an oosphere is termed an\r\n_oospore_.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the differentiation of the sexual cells does not proceed\r\nso far as the formation of antherozoids or of distinct oospheres; these\r\ncases I shall investigate with the others in detail presently.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, I will point out some of the modes of vegetative\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nThe commonest of these is cell division, as seen in unicellular plants,\r\nsuch as protococcus, where the one cell which composes the plant simply\r\ndivides into two, and each newly formed cell is then a complete plant.\r\n\r\nThe particular kind of cell division termed \"budding\" here deserves\r\nmention. It is well seen in the yeast-plant, where the cell bulges at\r\none side, and this bulge becomes larger until it is nipped off from the\r\nparent by contraction at the point of junction, and is then an\r\nindependent plant.\r\n\r\nNext, there is the process by which one plant becomes two by the dying\r\noff of some connecting portion between two growing parts.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, the case of the liverworts. In these there is a\r\nthallus which starts from a central point and continually divides in a\r\nforked or dichotomous manner. Now, if the central portion dies away, it\r\nis obvious that there will be as many plants as there were forkings, and\r\nthe further the dying of the old end proceeds, the more young plants\r\nwill there be.\r\n\r\nTake again, among higher plants, the cases of suckers, runners, stolons,\r\noffsets, etc. Here, by a process of growth but little removed from the\r\nnormal, portions of stems develop adventitious roots, and by the dying\r\naway of the connecting links may become independent plants.\r\n\r\nStill another vegetative method of reproduction is that by bulbils or\r\ngemmæ.\r\n\r\nA bulbil is a bud which becomes an independent plant before it commences\r\nto elongate; it is generally fleshy, somewhat after the manner of a\r\nbulb, hence its name. Examples occur in the axillary buds of _Lilium\r\nbulbiferum_, in some _Alliums_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe gemma is found most frequently in the liverworts and mosses, and is\r\nhighly characteristic of these plants, in which indeed vegetative\r\nreproduction maybe said to reach its fullest and most varied extent.\r\n\r\nGemmæ are here formed in a sort of flat cup, by division of superficial\r\ncells of the thallus or of the stem, and they consist when mature of\r\nflattened masses of cells, which lie loose in the cup, so that wind or\r\nwet will carry them away on to soil or rock, when, either by direct\r\ngrowth from apical cells, as with those of the liverworts, or with\r\nprevious emission of thread-like cells forming a \"protonema,\" in the\r\ncase of the mosses, the young plant is produced from them.\r\n\r\nThe lichens have a very peculiar method of gemmation. The lichen-thallus\r\nis composed of chains or groups of round chlorophyl-containing cells,\r\ncalled \"gonidia,\" and masses of interwoven rows of elongated cells which\r\nconstitute the hyphæ. Under certain conditions single cells of the\r\ngonidia become surrounded with a dense felt of hyphæ, these accumulate\r\nin numbers below the surface of the thallus, until at last they break\r\nout, are blown or washed away, and start germination by ordinary cell\r\ndivision, and thus at once reproduce a fresh lichen-thallus. These\r\nmasses of cells are called soredia.\r\n\r\nArtificial budding and grafting do not enter into the scope of this\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nAs in the general growth and the vegetative reproduction of plants\r\ncell-division is the chief method of cell formation, so in the\r\nreproduction of plants by special cells the great feature is the part\r\nplayed by cells which are produced not by the ordinary method of cell\r\ndivision, but by one or the other processes of cell formation, namely,\r\nfree-cell formation or rejuvenescence.\r\n\r\nIf we broaden somewhat the definition of rejuvenescence and free-cell\r\nformation, and do not call the mother-cells of spores of mosses, higher\r\ncryptogams, and also the mother-cells of pollen-grains, reproductive\r\ncells, which strictly speaking they are not, but only producers of the\r\nspores or pollen-grains, then we may say that _cell-division is confined\r\nto vegetative processes, rejuvenescence and free-cell formation are\r\nconfined to reproductive processes_.\r\n\r\nRejuvenescence may be defined as the rearrangement of the whole of the\r\nprotoplasm of a cell into a new cell, which becomes free from the\r\nmother-cell, and may or may not secrete a cell-wall around it.\r\n\r\nIf instead of the whole protoplasm of the cell arranging itself into one\r\nmass, it divides into several, or if portions only of the protoplasm\r\nbecome marked out into new cells, in each case accompanied by rounding\r\noff and contraction, the new cells remaining free from one another, and\r\nusually each secreting a cell wall, then this process, whose relation to\r\nrejuvenescence is apparent, is called free-cell formation.\r\n\r\nThe only case of purely vegetative cell-formation which takes place by\r\neither of these processes is that of the formation of endosperm in\r\nSelaginella and phanerogams, which is a process of free-cell formation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the universal contraction and rounding off of the\r\nprotoplasm, and the formation by either rejuvenescence or free-cell\r\nformation, distinctly mark out the special or true reproductive cell.\r\n\r\nExamples of reproductive cells formed by rejuvenescence are:\r\n\r\n1. The swarm spores of many algæ, as Stigeoclonium (figured in Sachs'\r\n\"Botany\"). Here the contents of the cell contract, rearrange themselves,\r\nand burst the side of the containing wall, becoming free as a\r\nreproductive cell.\r\n\r\n2. The zygoblasts of conjugating algæ, as in Spirogyra. Here the\r\ncontents of a cell contract and rearrange themselves only after contact\r\nof the cell with one of another filament of the plant. This zygoblast\r\nonly becomes free after the process of conjugation, as described below.\r\n\r\n3. The oosphere of characeæ, mosses and liverworts, and vascular\r\ncryptogams, where in special structures produced by cell-divisions there\r\narise single primordial cells, which divide into two portions, of which\r\nthe upper portion dissolves or becomes mucilaginous, while the lower\r\ncontracts and rearranges itself to form the oosphere.\r\n\r\n4. Spores of mosses and liverworts, of vascular cryptogams, and pollen\r\ncells of phanerogams, which are the analogue of the spores.\r\n\r\nThe type in all these cases is this: A mother-cell produces by\r\ncell-division four daughter-cells. This is so far vegetative. Each\r\ndaughter-cell contracts and becomes more or less rounded, secretes a\r\nwall of its own, and by the bursting or absorption of the wall of its\r\nmother-cell becomes free. This is evidently a rejuvenescence.\r\n\r\nExamples of reproductive cells formed by free-cell formation are:\r\n\r\n1. The ascospores of fungi and algæ.\r\n\r\n2. The zoospores or mobile spores of many algæ and fungi.\r\n\r\n3. The germinal vesicles of phanerogams.\r\n\r\nThe next portion of my subject is the study of the methods by which\r\nthese special cells reproduce the plant.\r\n\r\n1st. Asexual methods.\r\n\r\n1. Rejuvenescence gives rise to a swarm-spore or zoospore. The whole of\r\nthe protoplasm of a cell contracts, becomes rounded and rearranged, and\r\nescapes into the water, in which the plant floats as a mass of\r\nprotoplasm, clear at one end and provided with cilia by which it is\r\nenabled to move, until after a time it comes to rest, and after\r\nsecreting a wall forms a new plant by ordinary cell-division. Example:\r\nOedogonium.\r\n\r\n2. Free-cell formation forms swarm-spores which behave as above.\r\nExample: Achlya.\r\n\r\n3. Free-cell formation forms the typical motionless spore of algæ and\r\nfungi. For instance, in the asci of lichens there are formed from a\r\nportion of the protoplasm four or more small ascospores, which secrete a\r\ncell-wall and lie loose in the ascus. Occasionally these spores may\r\nconsist of two or more cells. They are set free by the rupture of the\r\nascus, and germinate by putting out through their walls one or more\r\nfilaments which branch and form the thallus of a new individual. Various\r\nother spores formed in the same way are known as _tetraspores_, etc.\r\n\r\n4. Cell-division with rejuvenescence forms the spores of mosses and\r\nhigher cryptogams.\r\n\r\nTo take the example of moss spores:\r\n\r\nCertain cells in the sporogonium of a moss are called mother-cells. The\r\nprotoplasm of each one of these becomes divided into four parts. Each of\r\nthese parts then secretes a cell-wall and becomes free as a spore by the\r\nrupture or absorption of the wall of the mother-cell. The germination of\r\nthe spores I shall describe later.\r\n\r\n5. A process of budding which in the yeast plant and in mosses is merely\r\nvegetatively reproductive, in fungi becomes truly reproductive, namely,\r\nthe buds are special cells arising from other special cells of the\r\nhyphæ.\r\n\r\nFor example, the so-called \"gills\" of the common mushroom have their\r\nsurface composed of the ends of the threads of cells constituting the\r\nhyphæ. Some of these terminal cells push out a little finger of\r\nprotoplasm, which swells, thickens its wall, and becomes detached from\r\nthe mother-cell as a spore, here called specially a _basidiospore_.\r\n\r\nAlso in the common gray mould of infusions and preserves, Penicillium,\r\nby a process which is perhaps intermediate between budding and\r\ncell-division, a cell at the end of a hypha constricts itself in several\r\nplaces, and the constricted portions become separate as _conidiospores_.\r\n\r\n_Teleutospores, uredospores_, etc., are other names for spores similarly\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThese conidiospores sometimes at once develop hyphæ, and sometimes, as\r\nin the case of the potato fungus, they turn out their contents as a\r\nswarm-spore, which actively moves about and penetrates the potato leaves\r\nthrough the stomata before they come to rest and elongate into the\r\nhyphal form.\r\n\r\nSo far for asexual methods of reproduction.\r\n\r\nI shall now consider the sexual methods.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive character of these methods is that the cell from which\r\nthe new individual is derived is incapable of producing by division or\r\notherwise that new individual without the aid of the protoplasm of\r\nanother cell.\r\n\r\nWhy this should be we do not know; all that we can do is to guess that\r\nthere is some physical or chemical want which is only supplied through\r\nthe union of the two protoplasmic masses. The process is of benefit to\r\nthe species to which the individuals belong, since it gives it a greater\r\nvigor and adaptability to varying conditions, for the separate\r\npeculiarities of two individuals due to climatic or other conditions are\r\nin the new generation combined in one individual.\r\n\r\nThe simplest of the sexual processes is conjugation. Here the two\r\ncombining cells are apparently of precisely similar nature and\r\nstructure. I say apparently, because if they are really alike it is\r\ndifficult to see what is gained by the union.\r\n\r\nConjugation occurs in algæ and fungi. A typical case is that of\r\nSpirogyra. This is an alga with its cells in long filaments. Two\r\ncontiguous cells of two parallel filaments push each a little projection\r\nfrom its cell-wall toward the other. When these meet, the protoplasm of\r\neach of the two cells contracts, and assumes an elliptical form--it\r\nundergoes rejuvenescence. Next an opening forms where the two cells are\r\nin contact, and the contents of one cell pass over into the other, where\r\nthe two protoplasmic bodies coalesce, contract, and develop a cell-wall.\r\nThe zygospore thus formed germinates after a long period and forms a new\r\nfilament of cells.\r\n\r\nAnother example of conjugation is that of Pandorina, an alga allied to\r\nthe well-known volvox. Here the conjugating cells swim free in water;\r\nthey have no cell-wall, and move actively by cilia. Two out of a number\r\napproach, coalesce, contract, and secrete a cell-wall. After a long\r\nperiod of rest, this zygospore allows the whole of its contents to\r\nescape as a swarm-spore, which after a time secretes a gelatinous wall,\r\nand by division reproduces the sixteen-celled family.\r\n\r\nWe now come to fertilization, where the uniting cells are of two kinds.\r\n\r\nThe simplest case is that of Vaucheria, an alga. Here the vegetative\r\nfilament puts out two protuberances, which become shut off from the body\r\nof the filament by partitions. The protoplasm in one of these\r\nprotuberances arranges itself into a round mass--the oosphere or female\r\ncell. The protoplasm of the other protuberance divides into many small\r\nmasses, furnished with cilia, the spermatozoids or male cells. Each\r\nprotuberance bursts, and some of the spermatozoids come in contact with\r\nand are absorbed by the oosphere, which then secretes a cell-wall, and\r\nafter a time germinates.\r\n\r\nThe most advanced type of fertilization is that of angiosperms.\r\n\r\nIn them there are these differences from the above process: the contents\r\nof the male cell, represented by the pollen, are not differentiated into\r\nspermatozoids, and there is no actual contact between the contents of\r\nthe pollen tube and the germinal vesicle, but according to Strashurger,\r\nthere is a transference of the substance of the nucleus of the pollen\r\ncell to that of the germinal vesicle by osmose. The coalescence of the\r\ntwo nuclei within the substance of the germinal vesicle causes the\r\nlatter to secrete a wall, and to form a new plant by division, being\r\nnourished the while by the mother plant, from whose tissues the young\r\nembryo plant contained in the seed only becomes free when it is in an\r\nadvanced stage of differentiation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable cases of fertilization occur in the Florideæ\r\nor red seaweeds, to which class the well-known Irish moss belongs.\r\n\r\nHere, instead of the cell which is fertilized by the rounded\r\nspermatozoid producing a new plant through the medium of spores, some\r\nother cell which is quite distinct from the primarily fertilized cell\r\ncarries on the reproductive process.\r\n\r\nIf the allied group of the Coleochæteæ is considered together with the\r\nFlorideæ, we find a transition between the ordinary case of Coleochæte\r\nand that of Dudresnaya. In Coleochæte, the male cell is a round\r\nspermatozoid, and the female cell an oosphere contained in the base of a\r\ncell which is elongated into an open and hair-like tube called the\r\ntrichogyne. The spermatozoid coalesces with the oosphere, which secretes\r\na wall, becomes surrounded with a covering of cells called a cystocarp,\r\nwhich springs from cells below the trichogyne, and after the whole\r\nstructure falls from the parent plant, spores are developed from the\r\noospore, and from them arises a new generation.\r\n\r\nIn Dudresnaya, on the other hand, the spermatozoid coalesces indeed with\r\nthe trichogyne, but this does not develop further. From below the\r\ntrichogyne, however, spring several branches, which run to the ends of\r\nadjacent branches, with the apical cells of which they conjugate, and\r\nthe result of this conjugation is the development of a cystocarp similar\r\nto that of Coleochæte. The remarkable point here is the way in which the\r\neffect of the fertilizing process is carried from one cell to another\r\nentirely distinct from it.\r\n\r\nThus I have endeavored to sum up the processes of asexual and of sexual\r\nreproduction. But it is a peculiar characteristic of most classes of\r\nplants that the cycle of their existence is not complete until both\r\nmethods of reproduction have been called into play, and that the\r\nstructure produced by one method is entirely different from that\r\nproduced by the other method.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is only in some algæ and fungi that the reproductive cells of\r\none generation produce a generation similar to the parent; in all other\r\nplants a generation A produces are unlike generation B, which may either\r\ngo on to produce another generation, C, and then back to A, or it may go\r\non producing B's until one of these reproduces A, or again it may\r\ndirectly reproduce; A. Thus we have the three types:\r\n\r\n  1. A-B-C.--A-B-C.--A..................... etc.\r\n  2. A-B-B.--B-B...................B--A ... etc.\r\n  3. A B A B A............................. etc.\r\n\r\nThe first case is not common, the usual number of generations being two\r\nonly; but a typical example of the occurrence of three generations is in\r\nsuch fungi as _Puccinia Graminis_. Here the first generation grows on\r\nbarberry leaves, and produces a kind of spore called an _æcidium spore_.\r\nThese æcidium spores germinate only on a grass stem or leaf, and a\r\ndistinct generation is produced, having a particular kind of spore\r\ncalled an _uredospore_. The uredospore forms fresh generations of the\r\nsame kind until the close of the summer, when the third generation with\r\nanother kind of spore, called a _teleutospore_, is produced.\r\n\r\nThe teleutospores only germinate on barberry leaves, and there reproduce\r\nthe original æcidium generation.\r\n\r\nThus we have the series A.B.B.B ... BCA\r\n\r\nIn this instance all the generations are asexual, but the most common\r\ncase is for the sexual and the asexual generations to alternate. I will\r\ndescribe as examples the reproduction of a moss, a fern, and a\r\ndicotyledon.\r\n\r\nIn such a typical moss as Funaria, we have the following cycle of\r\ndevelopments: The sexual generation is a dioecious leafy structure,\r\nhaving a central elongated axis, with leaves arranged regularly around\r\nand along it. At the top of the axis in the male plant rise the\r\nantheridia, surrounded by an envelope of modified leaves called the\r\nperigonium. The antheridia are stalked sacs, with a single wall of\r\ncells, and the spiral antherozoids arise by free-cell formation from the\r\ncells of the interior. They are discharged by the bursting of the\r\nantheridium, together with a mucilage formed of the degraded walls of\r\ntheir mother cells.\r\n\r\nIn the female plant there arise at the apex of the stem, surrounded by\r\nan envelope of ordinary leaves, several archegonia. These are of the\r\nordinary type of those organs, namely, a broad lower portion, containing\r\na naked oosphere and a long narrow neck with a central canal leading to\r\nthe oosphere. Down this canal pass one or more antherozoids, which\r\nbecome absorbed into the oosphere, and this then secretes a wall, and\r\nfrom it grows the second or asexual generation. The peculiarity of this\r\nasexual or spore-bearing plant is that it is parasitic on the sexual\r\nplant; the two generations, although not organically connected, yet\r\nremain in close contact, and the spore-bearing generation is at all\r\nevents for a time nourished by the leafy sexual generation.\r\n\r\nThe spore-bearing generation consists of a long stalk, closely held\r\nbelow by the cells of the base of the archegonium; this supports a\r\nbroadened portion which contains the spores, and the top is covered with\r\nthe remains of the neck of the archegonium forming the calyptra.\r\n\r\nThe spores arise from special or mother-cells by a process of division,\r\nor it may be even termed free-cell formation, the protoplasm of each\r\nmother-cell dividing into four parts, each of which contracts, secretes\r\na wall, and thus by rejuvenescence becomes a spore, and by the\r\nabsorption of the mother-cells the spores lie loose in the spore sac.\r\nThe spores are set free by the bursting of their chamber, and each\r\ngerminates, putting out a branched thread of cells called a protonema,\r\nwhich may perhaps properly be termed a third generation in the cycle of\r\nthe plant; for it is only from buds developed on this protonema that the\r\nleafy sexual plant arises.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics, then, of the mosses are, that the sexual generation\r\nis leafy, the one or two asexual generations are thalloid, and that the\r\nspore-bearing generation is in parasitic connection with the sexual\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the fern, these conditions are very different.\r\n\r\nThe sexual generation is a small green thalloid structure called a\r\nprothallium, which bears antheridia and archegonia, each archegonium\r\nhaving a neck-canal and oosphere, which is fertilized just as in the\r\nmoss.\r\n\r\nBut the asexual generation derived from the oospore only for a short\r\nwhile remains in connection with the prothallium, which, of course,\r\nanswers to the leafy portion of the moss. What is generally known as the\r\nfern is this asexual generation, a great contrast to the small leafless\r\nmoss fruit or sporogonium as it is called, to which it is\r\nmorphologically equivalent. On the leaves of this generation arise the\r\nsporangia which contain the spores. The spores are formed in a manner\r\nvery similar to those of the mosses, and are set free by rupture of the\r\nsporangium.\r\n\r\nThe spore produces the small green prothallium by cell-division in the\r\nusual way, and this completes the cycle of fern life.\r\n\r\nThe alternation of generations, which is perhaps most clear and typical\r\nin the case of the fern, becomes less distinctly marked in the plants of\r\nhigher organization and type.\r\n\r\nThus in the Rhizocarpæ there are two kinds of spores, _microspores_ and\r\n_macrospores_, producing prothallia which bear respectively antheridia\r\nand archegonia; in the Lycopodiaceæ, the two kinds of spores produce\r\nvery rudimentary prothallia; in the cycads and conifers, the microspore\r\nor pollen grain only divides once or twice, just indicating a\r\nprothallium, and no antheridia or antherozoids are formed. The\r\nmacrospore or embryo-sac produces a prothallium called the endosperm, in\r\nwhich archegonia or corpuscula are formed; and lastly, in typical\r\ndicotyledons it is only lately that any trace of a prothallium from the\r\nmicrospore or pollen cell has been discovered, while the macrospore or\r\nembryo-sac produces only two or three prothallium cells, known as\r\nantipodal cells, and two or three oospheres, known as germinal vesicles.\r\n\r\nThis description of the analogies of the pollen and embryo-sac of\r\ndicotyledons assumes that the general vegetative structure of this class\r\nof plants is equivalent to the asexual generation of the higher\r\ncryptogams. In describing their cycle of reproduction I will endeavor to\r\nshow grounds for this assumption.\r\n\r\nWe start with the embryo as contained in the seed. This embryo is the\r\nproduct of fertilization of a germinal vesicle by a pollen tube. Hence,\r\nby analogy with the product of fertilization of rhizocarp's, ferns, and\r\nmosses, it should develop into a spore bearing plant. It does develop\r\ninto a plant in which on certain modified leaves are produced masses of\r\ntissue in which two kinds of special reproductive cells are formed. This\r\nis precisely analogous to the case of gymnosperms, lycopods, etc., where\r\non leaf structures are formed macro and micro sporangia.\r\n\r\nTo deal first with the microsporangium or pollen-sac. The pollen cells\r\nare formed from mother cells by a process of cell division and\r\nsubsequent setting free of the daughter cells or pollen cells by\r\nrejuvenescence, which is distinctly comparable with that of the\r\nformation of the microspores of Lycopodiaceæ, etc. The subsequent\r\nbehavior of the pollen cell, its division and its fertilization of the\r\ngerminal vesicle or oosphere, leave no doubt as to its analogy with the\r\nmicrospore of vascular cryptogams.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the nucleus of the ovule corresponds with the macrosporangium\r\nof Selaginella, through the connecting link of the conifers, where the\r\novule is of similar origin and position to the macrosporangium of the\r\nLycopodiaceæ. But the formation of the macrospore or embryo-sac is\r\nsimpler than the corresponding process in cryptogams. It arises by a\r\nsimple enlargement of one cell of the nucleus instead of by the division\r\nof one cell into four, each thus becoming a macrospore. At the top of\r\nthis macrospore or embryo-sac two or three germinal vesicles are formed\r\nby free cell formation, and also two or three cells called antipodal\r\ncells, since they travel to the other end of the embryo-sac; these\r\nlatter represent a rudimentary prothallium. This formation of germinal\r\nvesicles and prothallium seems very different from the formation of\r\narchegonia and prothallium in Selaginella, for instance; but the link\r\nwhich connects the two is in the gymnosperms, where distinct archegonia\r\nin a prothallium are formed.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the flowering plant is essentially the equivalent of\r\nthe asexual fern, and of the sporogonium of the moss, and the pollen\r\ncell and the embryo-sac represent the two spores of the higher\r\ncryptogams, and the pollen tube and the germinal vesicles and antipodal\r\ncells are all that remain of the sexual generation, seen in the moss as\r\na leafy plant, and in the fern as a prothallium. Indeed, when a plant\r\nhas monoecious or dioecious flowers, the distinction between the asexual\r\nand the sexual generation has practically been lost, and the\r\nspore-bearing generation has become identified with the sexual\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nHaving now described the formation of the pollen and the germinal\r\nvesicles, it only remains to show how they form the embryo. The pollen\r\ncell forms two or three divisions, which are either permanent or soon\r\nabsorbed; this, as before stated, is the rudimentary male prothallium.\r\nThen when it lies on the stigma it develops a long tube, which passes\r\ndown the style and through the micropyle of the ovule to the germinal\r\nvesicles, one of which is fertilized by what is probably an osmotic\r\ntransference of nuclear matter. The germinal vesicle now secretes a\r\nwall, divides into two parts, and while the rest of the embyro-sac fills\r\nwith endosperm cells, it produces by cell division from the upper half a\r\nshort row of cells termed a suspensor, and from the lower half a mass of\r\ncells constituting the embryo. Thus while in the moss the asexual\r\ngeneration or sporogonium is nourished by the sexual generation or leafy\r\nplant, and while in the fern each generation is an independent\r\nstructure, here in the dicotyledon, on the other hand, the asexual\r\ngeneration or embryo is again for a time nourished in the interior of\r\nthe embryo-sac representing the sexual generation, and this again\r\nderives its nourishment from the previous asexual generation, so that as\r\nin the moss, there is again a partial parasitism of one generation on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the methods of plant reproduction: They resolve themselves\r\ninto two classes.\r\n\r\n1st. Purely vegetative.\r\n\r\n2d. Truly reproductive by special cells.\r\n\r\nIn the second class, if we count conjugation as a simple form of\r\nfertilization, there are only two types of reproductive methods.\r\n\r\n1st. Reproduction from an asexual spore.\r\n\r\n2d. Reproduction from an oospore formed by the combination of two sexual\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of plant species these two types are used by the\r\nindividuals alternately.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary similarity of the reproductive process, as shown in\r\nthe examples I have given, Achlya, Spirogyra, and Vaucheria among algæ,\r\nthe moss, the fern, and the flowering plant, a similarity which becomes\r\nthe more marked the more the details of each case and of the cases of\r\nplants which form links between these great classes are studied, points\r\nto a community of origin of all plants in some few or one primeval\r\nancestor. And to this inference the study of plant structure and\r\nmorphology, together with the evidence of palæobotany among other\r\ncircumstances, lends confirmatory evidence, and all modern discoveries,\r\nas for instance that of the rudimentary prothallium formed by the pollen\r\nof angiosperms, tend to the smoothing of the path by which the descent\r\nof the higher plants from simpler types will, as I think, be eventually\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION, $5 A YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
