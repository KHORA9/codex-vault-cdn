The\r\nconnexion of certain animals with man, and the readiness with which man\r\ncan subdue even the largest of the mammalia, are very curious subjects\r\nof thought. The dog and horse are our special friends and associates;\r\nthey seem to understand us, and we get very much attached to them. The\r\ncat or the cow, again, possess a different degree of attachment, and\r\nhave \"heads and hearts\" less susceptible of this education than the\r\nfirst mentioned. The anecdotes in this book will clearly show facts of\r\nthis nature. In the Letter of the Gorilla, under an appearance of\r\nexaggeration, will be found many facts of its history. We have a strong\r\nbelief that natural history, written as White of Selborne did his Letter\r\nof Timothy the Tortoise, would be very enticing and interesting to young\r\npeople. To make birds and other animals relate their stories has been\r\ndone sometimes, and generally with success. There are anecdotes hinging,\r\nhowever, on animals which have more to do with man than the other\r\nmammals referred to in the little story. These stories we have felt to\r\nbe very interesting when they occur in biographies of great men. Cowper\r\nand his Hares, Huygens and his Sparrow, are tales--at least the\r\nformer--full of interesting matter on the history of the lower animal,\r\nbut are of most value as showing the influence on the man who amused\r\nhimself by taming them. We like to know that the great Duke, after\r\ngetting down from his horse Copenhagen, which carried him through the\r\nwhole battle of Waterloo, clapped him on the neck, when the war-charger\r\nkicked out, as if untired.\r\n\r\nWe could have added greatly to this book, especially in the part of\r\njests, puns, or cases of _double entendre_. The few selected may\r\nsuffice. The so-called conversations of \"the Ettrick Shepherd\" are full\r\nof matter of this kind, treated by \"Christopher North\" with a happy\r\ncombination of rare power of description and apt exaggeration of detail,\r\noften highly amusing. One or two instances are given here, such as the\r\nFox-hunt and the Whale. The intention of this book is primarily to be\r\namusing; but it will be strange if it do not instruct as well. There is\r\nmuch in it that is _true_ of the habits of mammalia. These, with birds,\r\nare likely to interest young people generally, more than anecdotes of\r\nmembers of orders like fish, insects, or molluscs, lower in the scale,\r\nthough often possessing marvellous instincts, the accounts of which form\r\nintensely interesting reading to those who are fond of seeing or hearing\r\nof \"the works of the Lord,\" and who \"take pleasure\" in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MAMMALIA.[1]\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n   MAN                                                                 1\r\n\r\n   Gainsborough's Joke--Skull of Julius Cæsar when a boy               2\r\n\r\n   Sir David Wilkie's simplicity about Babies                          3\r\n\r\n   James Montgomery translates into verse a description of\r\n   Man, after the manner of Linnæus                                    4\r\n\r\n   Addison and Sir Richard Steele's Description of Gimcrack\r\n   the Collector                                                       5\r\n\r\n   MONKEYS                                                             9\r\n\r\n   The Gorilla and its Story                                           9\r\n\r\n   The Orang-Utan                                                     11\r\n\r\n   The Chimpanzee                                                     12\r\n\r\n   Letter of Mr Waterton                                              20\r\n\r\n   Mr Mitchell and the Young Chimpanzee                               22\r\n\r\n   Lady Anne Barnard pleads for the Baboons                           24\r\n\r\n   S.

Like Professor Owen, we\r\nare inclined to fancy he is well entitled to separate rank from even the\r\nLinnæan order, _Primates_, and to have more systematic honour conferred\r\non him than what Cuvier allowed him. That great French naturalist placed\r\nman in a section separate from his four-handed order, _Quadrumana_, and,\r\nfrom his two hands and some other qualities, enrolled our race in an\r\norder, _Bimana_. Surely the ancients surpassed many modern naturalists\r\nof the Lamarckian school, who would derive him from an ourang, a\r\nchimpanzee, or a gorilla. One of them has nobly said--\r\n\r\n     \"Os homini sublime dedit, coelumque tueri.\"\r\n\r\nOur own Sir William Hamilton, in a few powerful words has condensed what\r\nwill ever be, we are thankful to suppose, the general idea of most men,\r\nbe they naturalists or not, that mind and soul have much to distinguish\r\nus from every other animal:--\r\n\r\n\"What man holds of matter does not make up his personality. Man is not\r\nan organism. He is an intelligence served by organs. _They are_ HIS,\r\n_not_ HE.\"\r\n\r\nAs a mere specimen, we subjoin two or three anecdotes, although the\r\nspecies, _Homo sapiens_, has supplied, and might supply, many volumes of\r\nanecdotes touching on his whims and peculiarities. As a good example of\r\nthe Scottish variety, who is there that does not know Dean Ramsay's\r\n\"Reminiscences?\" Surely each nation requires a similar judicious\r\nselection. Mr Punch, especially when aided by his late admirable artist,\r\nJohn Leech, shows seemingly that John Bull and his family are as\r\ndistinct from the French, as the French are from the Yankees.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GAINSBOROUGH THE ARTIST, AND THE TAILOR.\r\n\r\nGainsborough, the painter, was very ready-witted. His biographer[2]\r\nrecords the following anecdote of him as very likely to be authentic.\r\nThe great artist occasionally made sketches from an honest old tailor,\r\nof the name of Fowler, who had a picturesque countenance and silver-gray\r\nlocks. On the chimney-piece of his painting-room, among other\r\ncuriosities, was a beautiful preparation of an infant _cranium_,\r\npresented to the painter by his old friend, Surgeon Cruickshanks.\r\nFowler, without moving his position, continually peered at it askance\r\nwith inquisitive eye. \"Ah! Master Fowler,\" said the painter, \"that is a\r\nmighty curiosity.\" \"What might it be, sir, if I may be so bold?\" \"A\r\n_whale's eye_,\" replied Gainsborough. \"Oh! not so; never say so, Muster\r\nGainsborough. Laws! sir, it is a little child's skull!\" \"You have hit\r\nupon it,\" said the wag. \"Why, Fowler, you are a witch! But what will you\r\nthink when I tell you that it is the skull of _Julius Cæsar_ when he was\r\na little boy?\" \"Do you say so!\" exclaimed Fowler, \"what a phenomenon!\"\r\n\r\nThis reminds us of a similar story told of a countryman, who was shown\r\nthe so-called skull of Oliver Cromwell at the museum in Oxford, and\r\nexpressed his delight by saying how gratifying it was to see skulls of\r\ngreat men at different ages, for he had just seen at Bath the skull of\r\nthe Protector when a youth!\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR DAVID WILKIE AND THE BABY.\r\n\r\nA very popular novelist and author of the present day tells the\r\nfollowing anecdote of the simplicity of Sir David Wilkie, with regard to\r\nhis knowledge of _infant_ human nature:--\r\n\r\nOn the birth of his first son, at the beginning of 1824, William\r\nCollins,[3] the great artist, requested Sir David Wilkie to become one\r\nof the sponsors for his child.[4] The painter's first criticism on his\r\nfuture godson is worth recording from its simplicity. Sir David, whose\r\nstudies of human nature extended to everything but _infant_ human\r\nnature, had evidently been refreshing his faculties for the occasion, by\r\ntaxing his boyish recollections of puppies and kittens; for, after\r\nlooking intently into the child's eyes as it was held up for his\r\ninspection, he exclaimed to the father, with serious astonishment and\r\nsatisfaction, \"He _sees_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN DEFINED SOMEWHAT IN THE LINNÆAN MANNER.\r\n\r\nOne who is partial to the Linnæan mode of characterising objects of\r\nnatural history has amused himself with drawing up the following\r\ndefinition of man:--\"_Simia sine cauda; pedibus posticis ambulans;\r\ngregarius, omnivorus, inquietus, mendax, furax, rapax, salax, pugnax,\r\nartium variarum capax, animalium reliquorum hostis, sui ipsius inimicus\r\nacerrimus._\"\r\n\r\nMontgomery translated the description thus:--\r\n\r\n   \"Man is an animal unfledged,\r\n   A monkey with his tail abridged;\r\n   A thing that walks on spindle legs,\r\n   With bones as brittle, sir, as eggs;\r\n   His body, flexible and limber,\r\n   And headed with a knob of timber;\r\n   A being frantic and unquiet,\r\n   And very fond of beef and riot;\r\n   Rapacious, lustful, rough, and martial,\r\n   To lies and lying scoundrels partial!\r\n   By nature form'd with splendid parts\r\n   To rise in science--shine in arts;\r\n   Yet so confounded cross and vicious,\r\n   A mortal foe to all his species!\r\n   His own best _friend_, and you must know,\r\n   His own worst _enemy_ by being so!\"[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nADDISON AND STEELE ON SOME OF THE PECULIARITIES OF THE NATURAL HISTORY\r\nCOLLECTORS OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\nIn one of the early volumes of _Chambers's Edinburgh Journal_, there was\r\na very curious paper entitled \"Nat Phin.\" Although considerably\r\nexaggerated, no one who had the happiness of knowing the learned,\r\namiable, and excellent Dr Patrick Neill, could fail to recognise, in the\r\ntransposed title, an amusing description of his love of natural history\r\npets, zoological and botanical. The fun of the paper is that \"Nat\" gets\r\nmarried, and, coming home one day from his office, finds that his young\r\nwife has caused the gardener to clear out his ponds of tadpoles and\r\nzoophytes.\r\n\r\nAddison or Sir Richard Steele, or both of them, in the following paper\r\nof the _Tatler_ (No. 221, Sept. 7, 1710), has given one of those quietly\r\nsatiric pictures of many a well-known man of the day, some Petiver or\r\nHans Sloane. The widow Gimcrack's letter is peculiarly racy. Although\r\nold books, the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ still furnish rare material to\r\nmany a popular magazine writer of the day, who sometimes does little\r\nmore than dilute a paper in these and other rare repertories of the\r\nstyle and wit of a golden age. We meditated offering various extracts\r\nfrom Swift and Daniel Defoe; but our space limits us to one, and the\r\nfollowing may for the present suffice.\r\n\r\n   \"_From my own Apartment, September 6._\r\n\r\n\"As I was this morning going out of my house, a little boy in a black\r\ncoat delivered me the following letter. Upon asking who he was, he told\r\nme that he belonged to my Lady Gimcrack. I did not at first recollect\r\nthe name, but, upon inquiry, I found it to be the widow of Sir Nicholas,\r\nwhose legacy I lately gave some account of to the world. The letter ran\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\"'MR BICKERSTAFF,--I hope you will not be surprised to receive a letter\r\nfrom the widow Gimcrack. You know, sir, that I have lately lost a very\r\nwhimsical husband, who, I find, by one of your last week's papers, was\r\nnot altogether a stranger to you. When I married this gentleman, he had\r\na very handsome estate; but, upon buying a set of microscopes, he was\r\nchosen a _Fellow of the Royal Society; from which time I do not remember\r\never to have heard him speak as other people did_, or talk in a manner\r\nthat any of his family could understand him. He used, however, to pass\r\naway his time very innocently in conversation with several members of\r\nthat learned body: for which reason I never advised him against their\r\ncompany for several years, until at last I found his brain quite turned\r\nwith their discourses. The first symptoms which he discovered of his\r\nbeing a _virtuoso_, as you call him, poor man! was about fifteen years\r\nago; when he gave me positive orders to turn off an old weeding woman,\r\nthat had been employed in the family for some years. He told me, at the\r\nsame time, that there was no such thing in nature as a weed, and that it\r\nwas his design to let his garden produce what it pleased; so that, you\r\nmay be sure, it makes a very pleasant show as it now lies. About the\r\nsame time he took a humour to ramble up and down the country, and would\r\noften bring home with him his pockets full of moss and pebbles. This,\r\nyou may be sure, gave me a heavy heart; though, at the same time, I must\r\nneeds say, he had the character of a very honest man, notwithstanding\r\nhe was reckoned a little weak, until he began to sell his estate, and\r\nbuy those strange baubles that you have taken notice of. Upon\r\nmidsummerday last, as he was walking with me in the fields, he saw a\r\nvery odd-coloured butterfly just before us. I observed that he\r\nimmediately changed colour, like a man that is surprised with a piece of\r\ngood luck; and telling me that it was what he had looked for above these\r\ntwelve years, he threw off his coat, and followed it. I lost sight of\r\nthem both in less than a quarter of an hour; but my husband continued\r\nthe chase over hedge and ditch until about sunset; at which time, as I\r\nwas afterwards told, he caught the butterfly as she rested herself upon\r\na cabbage, near five miles from the place where he first put her up. He\r\nwas here lifted from the ground by some passengers in a very fainting\r\ncondition, and brought home to me about midnight. His violent exercise\r\nthrew him into a fever, which grew upon him by degrees, and at last\r\ncarried him off. In one of the intervals of his distemper he called to\r\nme, and, after having excused himself for running out his estate, he\r\ntold me that he had always been more industrious to improve his mind\r\nthan his fortune, and that his family must rather value themselves upon\r\nhis memory as he was a wise man than a rich one. He then told me that it\r\nwas a custom among the Romans for a man to give his slaves their liberty\r\nwhen he lay upon his death-bed. I could not imagine what this meant,\r\nuntil, after having a little composed himself, he ordered me to bring\r\nhim a flea which he had kept for several months in a chain, with a\r\ndesign, as he said, to give it its manumission. This was done\r\naccordingly. He then made the will, which I have since seen printed in\r\nyour works word for word. Only I must take notice that you have omitted\r\nthe codicil, in which he left a large _concha veneris_, as it is there\r\ncalled, to a _Member of the Royal Society_, who was often with him in\r\nhis sickness, and _assisted him in his will_. And now, sir, I come to\r\nthe chief business of my letter, which is to desire your friendship and\r\nassistance in the disposal of those many rarities and curiosities which\r\nlie upon my hands. If you know any one that has an occasion for a parcel\r\nof dried spiders, I will sell them a pennyworth. I could likewise let\r\nany one have a bargain of cockle-shells. I would also desire your advice\r\nwhether I had best sell my beetles in a lump or by retail. The gentleman\r\nabove mentioned, who was my husband's friend, would have me make an\r\nauction of all his goods, and is now drawing up a catalogue of every\r\nparticular for that purpose, with the two following words in great\r\nletters over the head of them, Auctio Gimcrackiana. But, upon talking\r\nwith him, I begin to suspect he is as mad as poor Sir Nicholas was. Your\r\nadvice in all these particulars will be a great piece of charity to,\r\nSir, your most humble servant,\r\n\r\n   \"'ELIZABETH GIMCRACK.'\r\n\r\n\"I shall answer the foregoing letter, and give the widow my best advice,\r\nas soon as I can find out chapmen for the wares which she has to put\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Life of Thomas Gainsborough, R.A.

In the third, or principal room, will be found a nearly\r\ncomplete series of the QUADRUMANA or four-handed Mammalia. Monkeys are\r\n_quadrumanous mammalia_. The resemblance of these animals to men is most\r\nconspicuous, in the largest of them, such as the gorilla, orang-utan,\r\nchimpanzee, and the long-armed or gibbous apes. Such resemblance is most\r\ndistant in the ferocious dog-faced baboons of Africa, the _Cynocephali_\r\nof the ancients. It is softened off, but not effaced, in the pretty\r\nlittle countenances of those dwarf pets from South America, the\r\nouistities or marmosets, and other species of new-world monkeys, some of\r\nwhich are not larger than a squirrel.\r\n\r\nThey are well called MONKEYS, Monnikies, Mannikies--little men, \"_Simiæ\r\nquasi bestiæ hominibus similes_,\" \"monkeys, as if beasts resembling\r\nman,\" or \"mon,\" as the word man is pronounced in pure _Doric_ Saxon,\r\nwhether in York or Peebles.\r\n\r\n\"Monkey! you very degraded little brute, how much you resemble us!\" said\r\nold Ennius, without ever fancying that the day would come when some men\r\nwould regard their own race as little better than highly-advanced\r\nmonkeys.\r\n\r\nLet us never for a moment rest in such fallacious theories, or accept\r\nthe belief of Darwin and Huxley, with a few active agitating disciples,\r\nthat animals, and even plants, may pass into each other.\r\n\r\n   \"I think we are not wholly brain,\r\n   Magnetic mockeries; ...\r\n   Not only cunning casts in clay;\r\n   Let science prove we are, and then\r\n   What matters science unto men,\r\n   At least to me! I would not stay:\r\n   Let him, the wiser man who springs\r\n   Hereafter, up from childhood shape\r\n   His action, like the greater ape,\r\n   But I was born to other things.\"\r\n\r\n   --_In Memoriam_, cxix.\r\n\r\nDarwin and Huxley cannot change nature. They may change their minds and\r\nopinions, as their fathers did before them. It is, we suspect, only the\r\nold heathen materialism cropping out,--\r\n\r\n   \"Our little systems have their day--\r\n   They have their day and cease to be.\r\n   They are but broken lights of Thee,\r\n   And Thou, O Lord! art more than they.\"\r\n\r\n   --_In Memoriam._\r\n\r\nNo artists or authors have ever pictured or described monkeys like Sir\r\nEdwin Landseer and his brother Thomas. Surely a new edition of the\r\n_Monkeyana_ is wanted for the rising generation. Oliver Goldsmith, that\r\ngreat writer, who was most feeble in knowledge of natural history from\r\nalmost total ignorance of the subject, over which he threw the graces of\r\nhis charming style, noticed, as remarkable, that in countries \"where the\r\nmen are barbarous and stupid, the brutes are the most active and\r\nsagacious.\" He continues, that it is in the torrid tracts, inhabited by\r\nbarbarians, that animals are found with instinct so nearly approaching\r\nreason. Both in Africa and America, accordingly, he tells us, \"the\r\nsavages suppose monkeys to be men; idle, slothful, rational beings,\r\ncapable of speech and conversation, but obstinately dumb, for fear of\r\nbeing compelled to labour.\"\r\n\r\nFor the present, I shall suppose that the gorilla, largest of all the\r\napes, can not only speak, but write; and is speaking and writing to an\r\norang-utan of Borneo. Even a Lamarckian will allow this to be within the\r\nrange of possibility. Were it possible to get Gay or Cowper to write a\r\nnew set of fables, animals, in the days of postoffices and letters,\r\nwould become, like the age, epistolary. But a word on the imaginary\r\ncorrespondent.\r\n\r\nThe orang, as the reader knows, is the great red-haired \"Man of the\r\nWoods,\" as the name may be rendered in English. My old friend, Mr Alfred\r\nWallace, lately in New Guinea, and the adjoining parts, collecting\r\nnatural history subjects, and making all kinds of valuable observations\r\nand surveys, sent to Europe most of the magnificent specimens of this\r\n\"ugly beast\" now in the museum. He has detailed its habits and history\r\nin an able account, published some years ago in \"The Annals and Magazine\r\nof Natural History.\"\r\n\r\nIts home seems to be the fine forests which cover many parts of the\r\ncoast of Borneo. The home of the gorilla and chimpanzee are in the\r\ntropical forests of the coasts of Western Africa.\r\n\r\nThere would seem to be but three or four well established _species_ of\r\nthese apes, though there are, as in man and most created beings, some\r\nmarked or decided varieties. These apes are altogether _quadrupeds_,\r\nadapted for a life among trees. The late Charles Waterton, of Walton\r\nHall, whom I deem it an honour to have known for many years, personally\r\nand in his writings, has well shown this in his \"Essays on Natural\r\nHistory.\" Professor Owen, with his osteologies, and old Tyson, with his\r\nanatomies, have each demonstrated that--draw what inferences the\r\nfollowers of Mr Darwin may choose--monkeys are not men, but quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nThe structure of chimpanzee, orang, and gorilla considerably resembles\r\nthat of man, but so more distantly does a frog's, so does Scheuchzer's\r\nfossil amphibian in the museum, so does a squirrel's, so does a\r\nparrot's. Yet, because parrots, squirrels, frogs, and asses have skulls,\r\na pelvis, and fore-arms, they are _not_ men any more than fish are.\r\nLinnæus has given the _real_ specific, the _real_ class, order, and\r\ngeneric character of man, unique as a species, as a genus, as an order,\r\nor as a class, as even the greatest comparative anatomist of England\r\nregards him; \"Nosce teipsum:\" \"[Greek: Gnôthi seauton]\"--KNOW THYSELF.\r\nMan alone expects a hereafter. He is immortal, and anticipates, hopes\r\nfor, or dreads a resurrection. Melancholy it is that he alone, as an\r\nAmerican writer curiously remarks, collects bodies of men of _one_ blood\r\nto fight with each other. He alone can become a _drunkard_.\r\n\r\nThe reader must leave rhapsody, and may now be reminded, in explanation\r\nof allusions in the following letter, that the arm of Dr Livingstone,\r\nthe African traveller, was crushed and crunched by the bite and \"chaw\"\r\nof a lion. He will also please to notice, that the skeleton of the\r\ngorilla in the museum has the left arm broken by some dreadful accident.\r\nThis injury may _possibly_ have been caused by a fall when young, or\r\nmore probably by the empoisoned bite of a larger gorilla, or of a\r\ntree-climbing Leopard. So much may be premised before giving a letter,\r\nsupposed to be intercepted on its way between the Gaboon and London, and\r\nLondon and Borneo, opened at St Martin's-le-Grand, and detained as\r\nunpaid.\r\n\r\n\"I was born in a large baobab tree, on the west coast of Africa, not\r\nvery far from Calabar. We gorillas are good time-keepers, rise early and\r\ngo to bed early, guided infallibly by the sun. But though our family has\r\nbeen in existence at least six thousand years, we have no chronology,\r\nand care not a straw about our grandfathers. I suppose I had a\r\ngrandmother, but I never took _any_ interest in any but very close\r\nrelationships.\r\n\r\n\"We never toiled for our daily food, and are not idle like these lazy\r\nblack fellows who hold their palavers near us, and whom I, for my part,\r\nheartily despise. They cannot climb a tree, as we do, although they can\r\ntalk to each other, and make one another slaves. At least they so treat\r\ntheir countrymen far off where the fine sweet plantains grow, and some\r\nother juicy tit-bits, the memory of which makes my mouth water. These\r\nfellows have ugly wives, not nearly so big-mouthed as ours, without our\r\nnoble bony ridge, small ears, and exalted presence. They are actually\r\nforced to walk erect, and their fore-legs seldom touch the ground,\r\nexcept in the case of piccanninies. These little creatures crawl on the\r\nground, are much paler when born, and are then perfectly helpless; and\r\nhave no hair except on their heads, whereas our beautiful young are\r\nfine and hairy, and can swing among the branches, shortly after birth,\r\nnearly as well as their parents. When I was very young, I could soon\r\nhelp myself to fruits which abound on our trees.\r\n\r\n\"Have you dates, plantains, and soursops--so sweet--at Sarawak, Master\r\nRedhair? We have, and all kinds of them. I should like, for a variety,\r\nto taste yours. Mind you send me some of the _durian_.[6] Make haste and\r\nsend it, for Wallace's description makes my mouth water.\r\n\r\n\"I have told you our little ones soon learn to help themselves, whereas\r\nI have seen the piccaninnies of the blacks nursed by their mothers till\r\nmany rainy seasons had come and gone. I really think nothing of the\r\ntalking blacks who live near us. They put on bits of coloured rags, not\r\nnearly so bright, so regular, nor so _contrasting_ as the feathers of\r\nour birds.\r\n\r\n\"Beautifully coloured are the green touraco and the purple\r\nplantain-eater, a rascally bird! who eats some of our finest plantains,\r\nand has bitten holes in many a one I thought to get entirely to myself.\r\nWhy, our parrots beat these West-African negroes to sticks! Even our\r\ncommon gray parrot, so prettily scaled with gray, and with the red\r\nfeathers under his tail, is more natural than these blacks, with their\r\ndirty-white, yellow, blue, green, and red rags.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, that gray parrot beats them hollow both in its voice and in\r\nthe way it imitates. Do you know that when I have been giving my quick\r\nshort bark, to tell that I am not well pleased, I have heard one of\r\nthese fellows near me actually make me startle--its bark was so like to\r\nthat of one of our kind! I cannot bear the blacks! I have had a grudge\r\nagainst them since some little urchins shot at me when I was young, and\r\nmade my hand bleed. How it bled! My mother, with whom I had been, kept\r\nout of the way of these blackguards, but I was playing with another\r\nlittle gorilla, and forgot to keep a look-out. I have kept a good\r\nlook-out ever since I got _that_ wound, I assure you. I licked it often,\r\nand so did my mother with her delicious mouth. It soon left off bleeding\r\nand healed. We gorillas have no brandy, no whisky, no wine, not even\r\nsmall beer, to inflame our blood. We sleep, too, among the trees, clear\r\noff the ground, where there are dangerous vapours, so that we are free\r\nfrom all miasmata. West Africa is my lovely home, and I am big and\r\nbeautifully pot-bellied. It is the home of the large-eared chimpanzee, a\r\nnear relative of ours, though we never marry. He is an active fellow,\r\nwith rather large vulgar-looking ears; while mine, though I ought not to\r\nsay so, are beautifully small, and denote my more exalted birth. Master\r\nChimpanzee needs all his ears, for he is not so strong as I, and as you\r\nwill hear, we anthropoids have enemies in our trees, just as you perhaps\r\nhave, Master Redhair. We are both cautious of getting on the ground, and\r\nwhen there, I assure you I keep a sharp look-out.\r\n\r\n\"I have told you of one adventure I had in my youth, and now listen to\r\nanother which I have not forgotten to this day. My left arm aches now as\r\nI think of it.\r\n\r\n\"As I was one day gambolling with another playfellow in a large tree,\r\nwith great branches standing out from the trunk, and at a good height\r\nfrom the ground, my companion, another young gorilla, but with smaller\r\nmouth, larger nose, and other features uglier than mine, suddenly\r\nshrieked, and looked frightened and angry. No sooner had I noticed him\r\nthan my whole frame was shaken. I was seized by two paws in the small of\r\nmy back--a very painful part to be dug into--by ten hooked claws, nearly\r\nas long as tenpenny nails, but horribly sharp and hooked.--Oh my arm!\r\n\r\n\"I tried to turn round, and there was a most ferocious leopard growling\r\nat me. I tried to bite, and to scratch his eyes out, but the pain in the\r\nsmall of my back made me quite giddy. The spotted scoundrel seized my\r\nleft arm--how it aches!--and gave me a _crunch_ or two. I hear, I feel\r\nthe teeth against my bones as I write. My whole body is full of pain.\r\n\r\n\"My mother came and released me. She was large, handsome, and\r\nwell-to-do, with _such_ long and strong arms, and with a magnificent\r\nbulging and pouting mouth. In those days of my infancy I used to fancy I\r\nshould like to try to take as large a bite of a plantain as she could. I\r\ntried twice or thrice, but could only squash a tenth of the juice of the\r\nfruit into my mouth. She had glorious white teeth. Her grin clearly\r\nfrightened the leopard, as well as a pinch she gave him in the 'scruff'\r\nof the neck with one of her hands, while with the other she caught hold\r\nof his tail and made him yell. How he roared! He fell off the branch on\r\nto another; but soon, like all the cats, recovered his hold and jumped\r\ndown to the ground, when he skulked away with his tail behind him.\r\n\r\n\"I must really leave off, warned both by my paper and your impatience.\r\nWell, I grew stronger and bigger every day, and swung by one arm almost\r\nas well as the rest did with their two. I got, in fact, so strong on my\r\nhind feet, that my toes were actually in time thicker than those of any\r\nof my race. It is well, my dear Orang, to use what you have left you,\r\nand to try as soon as possible to forget what has been taken from you.\r\n\r\n\"... Look at my portrait, I am as strong, and as bony, and as bonnie, as\r\nany gorilla. But I begin to boast, so I will leave off.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo doubt that gorilla's injured arm affected its habits and its activity\r\nevery day of its life. The broken arm, never set by some gorilla surgeon\r\nof celebrity, formed a highly important feature in its biography.\r\nReader! when next thou visitest the noble Museum in Bloomsbury, look at\r\nthe skeleton of that gorilla, whose probable story Arachnophilus hath\r\ntried to give thee, and remember that both skin and skeleton were\r\nexhibited there before Du Chaillu became \"a lion.\"\r\n\r\nThe gorilla is a native of West Africa. It is closely allied to the\r\nchimpanzee, but grows to a larger size, and has many striking anatomical\r\ncharacters and external marks to distinguish it. It is certainly much\r\ndreaded by the natives on the banks of the Gaboon, and, doubtless,\r\ndreads them equally. Dr Gray procured a large specimen in a tub from\r\nthat district. It was skinned and set up by Mr Bartlett. I have seen\r\nphotographs in the hands of my excellent old friend--that admirable\r\nnatural history and anatomical draughtsman--Mr George Ford of Hatton\r\nGarden. These photographs were taken from its truly ugly face as it was\r\npulled out of the stinking brine. Life in death, or death in life, it\r\nwas most repulsive.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen read a most elaborate paper on the gorilla before the\r\nZoological Society. The great comparative anatomist and zoologist shows\r\nthat it _may_ have been the very species whose skins were brought by\r\nHanno to Carthage, in times before the Christian era, as the skins of\r\n_hairy wild men_. The historian refers to them as \"gorullai\" ([Greek:\r\nGôryllai].)\r\n\r\nThe natives of West Africa name it \"N'Geena.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stuffed specimen at the Museum is a young male. Its preparation does\r\ngreat credit to Mr Bartlett's care and knowledge, for the hair over\r\nnearly all the body was in patches among the spirit--thoroughly\r\ncorrupted in its alcoholic strength by animal matter. The peculiarly\r\nanthropoid and morbidly-disagreeable look that even the face of the\r\nyoung gorilla had was, of course, perfect in the photograph. In the\r\n_Leisure Hour_, a tolerably good cut of it was given, but the artist did\r\nnot copy the label accurately, for on the photograph from which that cut\r\nwas derived, _another name_ was rendered by _that_ sun, who pays no\r\ncompliments and tells no lies. Professor Owen, the greatest of\r\ncomparative anatomists, has made the subject of anthropoid apes his own,\r\nby the perfection of his researches, continued and continuous. He would\r\nhave liked, at least I may venture, I believe, to say so (if the matter\r\ngave him more than a moment's thought), that the name of Dr Gray had\r\nbeen on that label.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from C. Waterton, Esq., mentioning a young gorilla._\r\n\r\n                                          WALTON HALL, _Feb_. 4, 1856.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--As your favour of the 28th did not seem to require an\r\nimmediate answer I put it aside for a while, having a multiplicity of\r\nbusiness then on hand, and being obliged to be from home for a couple of\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"I beg to enclose you the letter to which you allude.\r\n\r\n\"Pray do not suppose that for one single moment I should be illiberal\r\nenough to undervalue a 'closet naturalist.' 'Non cuivis homini contingit\r\nadire corinthum.' It does not fall to every one's lot to range through\r\nthe forests of Guiana, still, a gentleman given to natural history may\r\ndo wonders for it in his own apartments on his native soil; and had\r\nAudubon, Swainson, Jameson, &c., not attacked me in all the pride of\r\npompous self-conceit, I should have been the last man in the world to\r\nexpose their gross ignorance.\r\n\r\n\"You ask me 'If we are to have another volume of essays?' I beg to\r\nanswer, no. Last year, Mrs Loudon (to whom I made a present of the\r\nessays) wrote to me, and asked for a few papers to be inserted in a\r\nforthcoming edition. I answered, that as I had had some strange and\r\nawful adventures since the 'Autobiography' made its appearance, I would\r\ntack them on to it. But from that time to this, I have never had a line,\r\neither from Mrs Loudon or from her publishers. But some months ago,\r\nhaving made a present of a superb case of preserved specimens in natural\r\nhistory to the Jesuits' College in Lancashire, I gave directions to my\r\nstationer at Wakefield to procure me from London the fourth or last\r\nedition of the essays; and I made references to it accordingly. But, lo\r\nand behold, when I had opened this supposed fourth edition, I saw\r\nprinted on the title page 'a new edition.' Better had they printed a\r\n_fifth edition_. This threw all my references wrong. Should you be\r\npassing by Messrs Longman, perhaps you will have the goodness to ask\r\nwhen this 'new edition' was printed.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry you did not show me your drawing of the chimpanzee before it\r\nwas engraved. The artist has not done justice to it. He has made the\r\nears far too large.[7] The little brown chimpanzee has very small ears;\r\nfully as small in proportion as those of a genuine negro. I am half\r\ninclined to give to the world a little treatise on the monkey tribe. I\r\nam prepared to show that Linnæus, Buffon, and all our hosts of\r\nnaturalists who have copied the remarks of these celebrated naturalists,\r\nare perfectly in the dark with regard to the true character of _all_ the\r\nmonkey tribe. Yesterday, I sent up to the _Gardener's Chronicle_ a few\r\nnotes on the woodpecker.--Believe me, dear sir, very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                     CHARLES WATERTON.\r\n\r\n\"P.S.--Many thanks for your nice little treatise on the chimpanzee.\"\r\n\r\nMr Waterton enclosed me a copy of the following letter, which he\r\npublished in a Yorkshire newspaper:--\r\n\r\n   _To Mrs Wombwell._\r\n\r\n\"MADAM,--I am truly sorry that the inclemency of the weather has\r\nprevented the inhabitants of this renowned watering-place from visiting\r\nyour wonderful gorilla, or brown orang-outang.\r\n\r\n\"I have passed two hours in its company, and I have been gratified\r\nbeyond expression.\r\n\r\n\"Would that all lovers of natural history could get a sight of it, as,\r\npossibly, they may never see another of the same species in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"It differs widely in one respect from all other orang-outangs which\r\nhave been exhibited in England--namely, that, when on the ground, it\r\nnever walks on the soles of its fore-feet, but on the knuckles of the\r\ntoes of those feet; and those toes are doubled up like the closed fist\r\nof a man. This must be a painful position; and, to relieve itself, the\r\nanimal catches hold of visitors, and clings caressingly to Miss Bright,\r\nwho exhibits it. Here then, it is at rest, with the toes of the\r\nfore-feet performing their natural functions, which they never do when\r\nthe animal is on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Hence I draw the conclusion that this singular quadruped, like the\r\nsloth, is not a walker on the ground of its own free-will, but by\r\naccident only.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt whatever it is born, and lives, and dies aloft, amongst the\r\ntrees in the forests of Africa.\r\n\r\n\"Put it on a tree, and then it will immediately have the full use of the\r\ntoes of its fore-feet. Place it on the ground, and then you will see\r\nthat the toes of the fore-feet become useless, as I have already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\"That it may retain its health, and thus remunerate you for the large\r\nsum which you have expended in the purchase of it, is, madam, the\r\nsincere hope of your obedient servant and well-wisher,\r\n\r\n                                                    CHARLES WATERTON.\"\r\n\r\nScarborough Cliff, No. 1, _Nov. 1, 1855_.\r\n\r\n\"_P.S._--You are quite at liberty to make what use you choose of this\r\nletter.

It was related to him by the\r\nlate Mr Mitchell, who was long the active secretary of the society, and\r\nwho did much to improve the Gardens. \"One damp November evening, just\r\nbefore dusk, there arrived a French traveller from Senegal, with a\r\ncompanion closely muffled up in a burnoose at his side. On going, at his\r\nearnest request, to speak to him at the gate, he communicated to me the\r\ninteresting fact that the stranger in the burnoose was a young chim, who\r\nhad resided in his family in Senegal for some twelve months, and who had\r\naccompanied him to England. The animal was in perfect health; but from\r\nthe state of the atmosphere required good lodging, and more tender care\r\nthan could be found in a hotel. He proposed to sell his friend. I was\r\nhard; did not like pulmonic property[10] at that period of the year,\r\nhaving already two of the race in moderate health, but could not refrain\r\nfrom an offer of hospitality during Chim's residence in London. Chim was\r\nto go to Paris if I did not buy him. So we carried him, burnoose and\r\nall, into the house where the lady chims were, and liberated him in the\r\ndoorway. They had taken tea, and were beginning to think of their early\r\ncouch. When the Senegal Adonis caught sight of them, he assumed a jaunty\r\nair and advanced with politeness, as if to offer them the last news from\r\nAfrica. A yell of surprise burst from each chimpanzella as they\r\nsuccessively recognised the unexpected arrival. One would have supposed\r\nthat all the Billingsgate of Chimpanzeedom rolled from the voluble\r\ntongues of these unsophisticated and hitherto unimpressible young\r\nladies; but probably their gesticulations, their shrill exclamations,\r\ntheir shrinkings, their threats, were but well-mannered expressions of\r\nwelcome to a countryman thus abruptly revealed in the foreign land of\r\ntheir captivity. Sir Chim advanced undaunted, and with the composure of\r\na high-caste pongo; if he had had a hat he would have doffed it\r\nincontinently, as it was, he only slid out of his burnoose and ascended\r\ninto the apartment which adjoined his countrywomen with agile grace, and\r\nthen, through the transparent separation, he took a closer view. Juliana\r\nyelled afresh. Paquita crossed her hands, and sat silently with face\r\nabout three quarters averted. Sir Chim uttered what may have been a\r\ntranquillising phrase, expressive of the great happiness he felt on thus\r\nbeing suddenly restored to the presence of kinswomen in the moment of\r\nhis deepest bereavement. Juliana calmed. Paquita diminished her angle of\r\naversion, and then Sir Chim, advancing quite close to the division,\r\nbegan what appeared to be a recollection of a minuet. He executed\r\nmarvellous gestures with a precision and aplomb which were quite\r\nenchanting, and when at last he broke out into a quick movement with\r\nloud smacking stamps, the ladies were completely carried away, and gave\r\nhim all attention. Friendship was established, refreshments were served,\r\nnotwithstanding the previous tea, and everybody was apparently\r\nsatisfied, especially the stranger. Upon asking the Senegal proprietor\r\nwhat the dance meant, he told me that the animal had voluntarily taken\r\nto that imitation of his slaves, who used to dance every evening in the\r\ncourtyard.\"\r\n\r\nSo far Mr Mitchell's narrative; the reviewer relates how a chimpanzee,\r\nplaced for a short time in the society of the children of his owner in\r\nthis country, not only throve in an extraordinary manner, was perfectly\r\ndocile and good-tempered, but learnt to imitate them. When the eldest\r\nlittle boy wished to tease his playfellow, he used, childlike, to make\r\nfaces at him. Chim soon outdid him, and one of the funniest things\r\nimaginable was to see him blown at and blowing in return; his\r\nprotrusible lips converted themselves into a trumpet-shaped instrument,\r\nwhich reminded one immediately of some of the devils of Albert Dürer, or\r\nthose incredible forms which the old painters used to delight in piling\r\ntogether in their temptations of Saint Anthony.\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY ANNE BARNARD PLEADS FOR THE BABOONS.\r\n\r\nLady Anne Barnard, whose name as the writer of \"Auld Robin Gray\" is\r\nfamiliar to every one who knows that most pathetic ballad, spent five\r\nyears with her husband at the Cape (1797-1802). Her journal letters to\r\nher sisters are most amusing, and full of interesting observations.[11]\r\nAfter describing \"Musquito-hunting\" with her husband, she writes:--\"In\r\nreturn, I endeavoured to effect a treaty of peace for the baboons, who\r\nare apt to come down from the mountain in little troops to pillage our\r\ngarden of the fruit with which the trees are loaded. I told him he would\r\nbe worse than Don Carlos if he refused the children of the sun and the\r\nsoil the use of what had descended from ouran-outang to ouran-outang;\r\nbut, alas! I could not succeed. He had pledged himself to the\r\ngardener,[12] to the slaves, and all the dogs, not to baulk them of\r\ntheir sport; so he shot a superb man-of-the-mountain one morning, who\r\nwas marauding, and electrified himself the same moment, so shocked was\r\nhe at the groan given by the poor creature as he limped off the ground.\r\nI do not think I shall hear of another falling a sacrifice to Barnard's\r\ngun; they come too near the human race\" (p. 408).\r\n\r\nIn another letter she says (p. 391), \"The best way to get rid of them is\r\nto catch one, whip him, and turn him loose; he skips off chattering to\r\nhis comrades, and is extremely angry, but none of them return the season\r\nthis is done. I have given orders, however, that there may be no\r\nwhipping.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nS. BISSET AND HIS TRAINED MONKEYS.\r\n\r\nWe have elsewhere referred to S. Bisset as a trainer of animals. Among\r\nthe earliest of his trials, this Scotchman took two monkeys as pupils.\r\nOne of these he taught to dance and tumble on the rope, whilst the other\r\nheld a candle with one paw for his companion, and with the other played\r\na barrel organ. These animals he also instructed to play several\r\nfanciful tricks, such as drinking to the company, riding and tumbling\r\nupon a horse's back, and going through several regular dances with a\r\ndog. The horse and dog referred to, were the first animals on which this\r\ningenious person tried his skill. Although Bisset lived in the last\r\ncentury, few persons seem to have surpassed him in his power of teaching\r\nthe lower animals. We have seen a man in Charlotte Square, in 1865, make\r\na new-world monkey go through a series of tricks, ringing a bell, firing\r\na pea-gun, and such like. Poor Jacko was to be pitied. His want of heart\r\nin his labours was very evident. Poor fellow, no time for reflection was\r\nallowed him. Like some of the masters in the Old High School,--such\r\ncruelty dates back more than thirty years,--a ferule, or a pair of tawse\r\nkept Jacko to his work. It was play to the onlookers, but no sport to\r\nmaster Cebus. Had he possessed memory and reflection, how his thoughts\r\nmust have wandered from Edinburgh to the forests of the Amazon!\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD BYRON'S PETS.\r\n\r\nBeside horses and dogs, the poet Byron, like his own Don Juan, had a\r\nkind of inclination, or weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,\r\n_live animals_.\r\n\r\nCaptain Medwin records, in one of his conversations, that the poet\r\nremarked that it was troublesome to travel about with so much live and\r\ndead stock as he did, and adds--\"I don't like to leave behind me any of\r\nmy pets, that have been accumulating since I came on the Continent. One\r\ncannot trust to strangers to take care of them. You will see at the\r\nfarmer's some of my pea-fowls _en pension_. Fletcher tells me that they\r\nare almost as bad fellow-travellers as the monkey, which I will show\r\nyou.\" Here he led the way to a room where he played with and caressed\r\nthe creature for some time. He afterwards bought another monkey in Pisa,\r\nbecause he saw it ill-used.[13]\r\n\r\nLord Byron's travelling equipage to Pisa in the autumn of 1821,\r\nconsisted, _inter cætera_, of nine horses, a monkey, a bull-dog, and a\r\nmastiff, two cats, three pea-fowls, and some hens.[14]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ETTRICK SHEPHERD'S MONKEY.\r\n\r\n(_From the \"Noctes Ambrosianæ,\" Dec. 1825._[15])\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ I wish that you but saw my monkey, Mr North. He would make\r\nyou hop the twig in a guffaw. I ha'e got a pole erected for him, o'\r\nabout some 150 feet high, on a knowe ahint Mount Benger; and the way the\r\ncretur rins up to the knob, looking ower the shouther o' him, and\r\ntwisting his tail roun' the pole for fear o' playin' thud on the grun',\r\nis comical past a' endurance.\r\n\r\n_North._ Think you, James, that he is a link?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ A link in creation? Not he, indeed. He is merely a monkey.\r\nOnly to see him on his observatory, beholding the sunrise! or weeping,\r\nlike a Laker, at the beauty o' the moon and stars!\r\n\r\n_North._ Is he a bit of a poet?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ Gin he could but speak and write, there can be nae manner o'\r\ndoubt that he would be a gran' poet. Safe us! what een in the head o'\r\nhim! Wee, clear, red, fiery, watery, malignant-lookin een, fu' o'\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\n_Tickler._ You should have him stuffed.\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ Stuffed, man! say, rather, embalmed. But he's no likely to\r\ndee for years to come--indeed, the cretur's engaged to be married;\r\nalthough he's no in the secret himsel yet. The bawns are published.\r\n\r\n_Tickler._ Why really, James, marriage I think ought to be simply a\r\ncivil contract.\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ A civil contract! I wuss it was. But, oh! Mr Tickler, to see\r\nthe cretur sittin wi' a pen in 's hand, and pipe in 's mouth, jotting\r\ndown a sonnet, or odd, or lyrical ballad! Sometimes I put that black\r\nvelvet cap ye gied me on his head, and ane o' the bairns's auld\r\nbig-coats on his back; and then, sure aneugh, when he takes his stroll\r\nin the avenue, he is a heathenish Christian.\r\n\r\n_North._ Why, James, by this time he must be quite like one of the\r\nfamily?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ He's a capital flee-fisher. I never saw a monkey throw a\r\nlighter line in my life.... Then, for rowing a boat!\r\n\r\n_Tickler._ Why don't you bring him to Ambrose's?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ He's sae bashfu'. He never shines in company; and the least\r\nthing in the world will make him blush.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINDHORN FISHERMAN AND THE MONKEY.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Dick Lauder[16] records the adventures of a monkey in\r\nMorayshire, whose wanderings sadly alarmed the inhabitants who saw him,\r\nall unused as they were to the sight of such an exotic stranger.\r\n\r\n\"We knew a large monkey, which escaped from his chain, and was abroad in\r\nMorayshire for some eight or ten days. Wherever he appeared he spread\r\nterror among the peasantry. A poor fisherman on the banks of the\r\nFindhorn was sitting with his wife and family at their frugal meal, when\r\na hairy little man, as they in their ignorance conceived him to be,\r\nappeared on the window sill and grinned, and chattered through the\r\ncasement what seemed to them to be the most horrible incantations.\r\nHorror-struck, the poor people crowded together on their knees on the\r\nfloor, and began to exorcise him with prayers most vehemently, until\r\nsome external cause of alarm made their persecutor vanish. The\r\nneighbours found the family half dead with fear, and could with\r\ndifficulty extract from them the cause. 'Oh! worthy neebours!' at last\r\nexclaimed the goodman with a groan, 'we ha'e seen the _Enemy_ glowrin'\r\nat us through that vera wundow there. Lord keep us a'!!' He next alarmed\r\na little hamlet near the hills; appearing and disappearing to various\r\nindividuals in a most mysterious manner; till at last a clown, with a\r\nfew grains of more courage than the rest, loaded his gun and put a\r\nsixpence into it, with the intention of stealing upon him as he sat most\r\nmysteriously chattering on the top of a cairn of stones, and then\r\nshooting him with silver, which is known never to fail in finishing the\r\nimps of the Evil One. And lucky indeed was it for pug that he chanced,\r\nthrough whim, to abscond from that quarter; for if he had not so\r\ndisappeared, he might have died by the lead, if not by the silver. As it\r\nwas, the bold peasant laid claim to the full glory of compelling this\r\ndreaded goblin to flee.\"\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Lauder kept several pets in his beautiful seat at the Grange,\r\nlong occupied by the Messrs Dalgleish of Dreghorn Castle as a genteel\r\nboarding-school, and now by the Misses Mouatt as one for young ladies.\r\nWe have often seen the tombstones to his dogs, which were buried to the\r\nsouth of that mansion, in which Principal Robertson the historian died,\r\nand where Lord Brougham, his relation, used to go when a boy at the High\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH MARQUIS AND HIS MONKEY.\r\n\r\nDr John Moore, the father of General Moore, who fell at Corunna, in one\r\nof the graphic sketches of a Frenchman which he gives in his work on\r\nItaly, records a visit he paid to the Marquis de F---- at Besançon.\r\nAfter many questions, he says, \"Before I could make any answer, I\r\nchanced to turn my eyes upon a person whom I had not before observed,\r\nwho sat very gravely upon a chair in a corner of the room, with a large\r\nperiwig in full dress upon his head. The marquis, seeing my surprise at\r\nthe sight of this unknown person, after a very hearty fit of laughter,\r\nbegged pardon for not having introduced me sooner to that gentleman (who\r\nwas no other than a large monkey), and then told me, he had the honour\r\nof being attended by a physician, who had the reputation of possessing\r\nthe greatest skill, and who _certainly_ wore the largest periwigs of any\r\ndoctor in the province. That one morning, while he was writing a\r\nprescription at his bedside, this same monkey had catched hold of his\r\nperiwig by one of the knots, and instantly made the best of his way out\r\nat the window to the roof of a neighbouring house, from which post he\r\ncould not be dislodged, till the doctor, having lost patience, had sent\r\nhome for another wig, and never after could be prevailed on to accept of\r\nthis, which had been so much disgraced. That, _enfin_, his valet, to\r\nwhom the monkey belonged, had, ever since that adventure, obliged the\r\nculprit by way of punishment to sit quietly, for an hour every morning,\r\nwith the periwig on his head.--Et pendant ces moments de tranquillité je\r\nsuis honoré de la société du venerable personage. Then, addressing\r\nhimself to the monkey, \"Adieu, mon ami, pour aujourdhui--au plaisir de\r\nvous revoir;\" and the servant immediately carried Monsieur le Médicin\r\nout of the room.[17]\r\n\r\nThis is a most characteristic bit, which could scarcely have occurred\r\nout of France, where monkeys and dogs are petted as we never saw them\r\npetted elsewhere. These things were so when we knew Paris under\r\nLouis-Philippe. Frenchmen, surely, have not much changed under Louis\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANDRILL AND GEORGE THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\nOne of the attractive sights of Mr Cross's menagerie, some forty years\r\nor so ago, was a full-grown baboon, to which had been given the name of\r\n\"Happy Jerry.\" He was conspicuous from the finely-coloured rib-like\r\nridges on each side of his cheeks, the clear blue and scarlet hue of\r\nwhich, on such a hideous long face and muzzle, with its small,\r\ndeeply-sunk malicious eyes, and projecting brow and cheeks, seemed\r\nalmost as if beauty and bestiality were here combined. But Jerry had a\r\nhabit which would have made Father Matthew loathe him and those who\r\nencouraged him. He had been taught to sit in an armchair and to drink\r\nporter out of a pot, like a thirsty brickmaker; and, as an addition to\r\nhis accomplishments, he could also smoke a pipe, like a trained pupil of\r\nSir Walter Raleigh. This rib-nosed baboon, or mandrill, as he is often\r\ncalled, obtained great renown; and among other distinguished personages\r\nwho wished to see him was his late majesty King George the Fourth. As\r\nthat king seldom during his reign frequented places of public resort, Mr\r\nCross was invited to bring Jerry to Windsor or Brighton, to display the\r\ntalents of his redoubtable baboon. I have heard Mr Cross say, that the\r\nking placed his hands on the arm of one of the ladies of the Court, at\r\nwhich Jerry began to show such unmistakable signs of ferocity, that the\r\nmild, kind menagerist was glad to get Jerry removed, or at least the\r\nking and his courtiers to withdraw. He showed his great teeth and\r\ngrinned and growled, as a baboon in a rage is apt to do. Jerry was a\r\npowerful beast, especially in his fore-legs or arms. When he died, Mr\r\nCross presented his skin to the British Museum, where it has been long\r\npreserved. The mandrill is a native of West Africa, where he is much\r\ndreaded by the negroes.\r\n\r\nIn Cross's menagerie at Walworth, nearly twenty years ago, there was\r\ngenerally a fine mandrill. We remember the sulky ferocity of that\r\nrestless eye. How angry the mild menagerist used to be at the ladies in\r\nthe monkey-room with their parasols! These appendages were the feelers\r\nwith which some of the softer sex used to touch Cross's monkeys, and, as\r\nthe old gentleman used to insist, helped to kill them. Parasols were\r\nfreely used to touch the boas and other snakes feeding in the same warm\r\nroom. No doubt a boa-constrictor could not live comfortably if his soft,\r\nmuscular sides got fifty pokes a day from as many sticks or parasols.\r\nEdward Cross, mild, gentle, gentlemanly, Prince of show-keepers, used to\r\nbe very indignant at the inquisitorial desire possessed, especially by\r\nsome of the fairer sex, to try the relative hardness and softness of\r\nserpents and monkeys, and other mammals and creatures. This story of the\r\nmandrill may excuse this pendant of an episode.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG LADY'S PET MONKEY AND HER PARROT.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole tells an anecdote of a fine young French lady, a Madame\r\nde Choiseul. She longed for a parrot that should be a miracle of\r\neloquence. A parrot was soon found for her in Paris. She also became\r\nenamoured of General Jacko, a celebrated monkey, at Astley's. But the\r\npossessor was so exorbitant in his demand for Jacko, that the General\r\ndid not change proprietors. Another monkey was soon heard of, who had\r\nbeen brought up by a cook in a kitchen, where he had learned to pluck\r\nfowls with inimitable dexterity. This accomplished pet was bought and\r\npresented to Madame, who accepted him. The first time she went out, the\r\ntwo animals were locked up in her bed-chamber. When the lady returned,\r\nthe monkey was alone to be seen. Search, was made for Pretty Poll, and\r\nto her horror she was found at last under bed, shivering and cowering,\r\nand without a feather. It seems that the two pets had been presented by\r\nrival lovers of Madame. Poll's presenter concluded that his rival had\r\ngiven the monkey with that very view, challenged him; they fought, and\r\nboth were wounded: and a heroic adventure it was![18]\r\n\r\n\r\nMONKEYS POOR RELATIONS.\r\n\r\nOne of Luttrell's sayings, recorded by Sydney Smith, was,--\r\n\r\n\"I hate the sight of monkeys, they remind me so of poor relations.\" Here\r\nfollows a fine passage of Sydney Smith, which he might have written\r\nafter hearing the lectures of Professor Huxley.[19] \"I confess I feel\r\nmyself so much at my ease about the superiority of mankind,--I have such\r\na marked and decided contempt for the understanding of every baboon I\r\nhave yet seen,--I feel so sure that the blue ape without a tail will\r\nnever rival us in poetry, painting, and music,--that I see no reason\r\nwhatever why justice may not be done to the few fragments of soul, and\r\ntatters of understanding, which they may really possess. I have\r\nsometimes, perhaps, felt a little uneasy at Exeter 'Change, from\r\ncontrasting the monkeys with the 'prentice boys who are teasing them;\r\nbut a few pages of Locke, or a few lines of Milton, have always restored\r\nmy tranquillity, and convinced me that the superiority of man had\r\nnothing to fear.\"[20]\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS COLIN MACKENZIE OBSERVES APES AT SIMLA.[21]\r\n\r\nThe monkey she alludes to seems to be the _Semnopithecus Entellus_, a\r\nblack-faced, light-haired monkey, with long legs and tail, much\r\nvenerated by the Hindoos.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs L. and I were very much amused, early this morning (July 5), by\r\nwatching numbers of huge apes, the size of human beings, with white hair\r\nall round their faces, and down their backs and chests, who were\r\ndisporting themselves and feeding on the green leaves, on the sides of\r\nthe precipice close to the house. Many of them had one or two little\r\nones--the most amusing, indefatigable little creatures imaginable--who\r\nwere incessantly running up small trees, jumping down again, and\r\nperforming all sorts of antics, till one felt quite wearied with their\r\nperpetual activity. When the mother wished to fly, she clutched the\r\nlittle one under her arm, where, clinging round her body with all its\r\narms, it remained in safety, while she made leaps of from thirty to\r\nforty feet, and ran at a most astonishing rate down the khad, catching\r\nat any tree or twig that offered itself to any one of her four arms.\r\nThere were two old grave apes of enormous size sitting together on the\r\nbranch of a tree, and deliberately catching the fleas in each other's\r\nshaggy coats. The patient sat perfectly still, while his brother ape\r\ndivided and thoroughly searched his beard and hair, lifted up one arm\r\nand then the other, and turned him round as he thought fit; and then the\r\npatient undertook to perform the same office for his friend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AYE-AYE (_Chiromys Madagascariensis_).\r\n\r\nZoologists used to know a very curious animal from Madagascar, by name,\r\nor by an indifferent specimen preserved in the Paris Museum. Sonnerat,\r\nthe naturalist, obtained it from that great island so well known to\r\ngeographical boys in former days by its being, so they were told, the\r\nlargest island in the world. This strange quadruped was named by a word\r\nwhich meant \"handed-mouse,\" for such is the signification of _chiromys_,\r\nor _cheiromys_, as it used to be spelled. This creature, when its\r\nhistory was better known, was believed to be not far removed in the\r\nsystem from the lemurs and loris. Its soft fur, long tail, large eyes,\r\nand other features and habits connected it with these quadrumana, while\r\nits rodent dentition seemed to refer it to the group containing our\r\nsquirrels, hares, and mice. It has been the subject of a profound memoir\r\nby Professor Owen, our greatest comparative anatomist; and I remember,\r\nwith pleasure, the last time I saw him at the Museum he was engaged in\r\nits dissection. I may here refer to one of the Professor's lighter\r\nproductions--a lecture at Exeter Hall on some instances of the \"power of\r\nGod as manifested in His animal creation\"--for a very nice notice of\r\nthis curious quadruped. In one of the French journals, there was an\r\nexcellent account given of the peculiar habits of the little nocturnal\r\ncreature. In those tropical countries the trees are tenanted by\r\ncountless varieties of created things. Their wood affords rich feeding\r\nto the large, fat, pulpy grubs of beetles of the families _Buprestidæ_,\r\n_Dynastidæ_, _Passalidæ_, and, above all, that glorious group the\r\n_Longicornia_. These beetles worm their way into the wood, making often\r\nlong tunnels, feeding as they work, and leaving their _ejecta_ in the\r\nshape of agglomerated sawdust. It is into the long holes drilled by\r\nthese beetles that the Aye-Aye searches with his long fingers, one of\r\nwhich, on the fore-hand, is specially thin, slender, and skeleton-like.\r\nIt looks like the tool of some lock-picker. Our large-eyed little\r\nfriend, like the burglar, comes out at night and finds these holes on\r\nthe trees where he slept during the day. His sensitive thin ears, made\r\nto hear every scratch, can detect the rasping of the retired grub,\r\nfeasting in apparent security below. Naturalists sometimes hear at\r\nnight, so Samouelle once told me, the grubs of moths munching the dewy\r\nleaves. Our aye-aye is no collector, but he has eyes, ears, and fingers\r\ntoo, that see, hear, and get larvæ that, when grown and changed into\r\nbeetles, are the valued prizes of entomologists. Into that tunnelled\r\nhole he inserts his long finger, and squash it goes into a large, pulpy,\r\nfat, sweet grub. It takes but a moment to draw it out; and if it be a\r\npupa near the bark, so much the better for the aye-aye, so much the\r\nworse for the beetle or cossus. I might dilate on this subject, but\r\nprefer referring the reader to Professor Owen's memoir, and to his\r\nlecture.[22] The aye-aye, in every point of its structure, like every\r\ncreated thing, is full of design. Its curious fingers, especially the\r\nskeleton-like chopstick of a digit referred to, attract especial notice,\r\nfrom their evident adaptation to the condition of its situation and\r\nexistence, as one of the works of an omnipotent and beneficent Creator.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] The Durian, a peculiarly favourite fruit in several of the Eastern\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n[7] Mr Wolf's drawing was taken from a chimpanzee.

It is evident from Noel Paton's fairy\r\npictures that he has closely studied their often fantastic faces. The\r\nwriter could commend to his attention an African bat, lately figured by\r\nhis friend Mr Murray.[23] Its enormous head, or rather muzzle, compared\r\nwith its other parts, gives it an outrageously hideous look. In the late\r\nexcellent Dr Horsfield's work on the animals of Java, there are some\r\nengravings of bats by Mr Taylor, who acquired among engravers the title\r\nof \"Bat Taylor,\" so wonderfully has he rendered the exquisite pileage or\r\nfur of these creatures. It is wonderful how numerous the researches of\r\nnaturalists, such as Mr Tomes, of Welford, near Stratford, have shown\r\nthe order _Cheiroptera_ to be in genera and species. Their profiles and\r\nfull faces, even in outline, are often most bizarre and strange. Their\r\ninterfemoral membranes, we may add, are actual \"unreticulated\" nets,\r\nwith which they catch and detain flies as they skim through the air.\r\nThey pick these out of this bag with their mouths, and \"make no bones\"\r\nof any prey, so sharp and pointed are their pretty insectivorous teeth.\r\nTheir flying membranes, stretched on the elongated finger-bones of their\r\nfore-legs, are wonderful adaptations of Divine wisdom, a capital subject\r\nfor the natural theologian to select.\r\n\r\nOur poet-laureate must be a close observer of natural history. In his\r\n\"In Memoriam,\" xciv., he distinctly alludes to some very curious West\r\nAfrican bats first described by the late amiable Edward T. Bennett, long\r\nthe much-valued secretary of the Zoological Society. These bats are\r\nclosely related to the fox bats, and form a genus which is named, from\r\ntheir shoulder and breast appendages, _Epomophorus_:--\r\n\r\n   \"Bats went round in fragrant skies,\r\n   And wheel'd or lit the filmy shapes\r\n   That haunt the dusk, with ermine capes,\r\n   And woolly breasts and beaded eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe species Mr Bennett named _E. Whitei_, after the good Rev. Gilbert\r\nWhite, that well-known worthy who wrote \"The Natural History of\r\nSelborne,\" wherein are many notices of bats.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN COOK'S SAILOR AND HIS DESCRIPTION OF A FOX-BAT.\r\n\r\nIt is curious, now that Australia is almost as civilised, and in parts\r\nnearly as populous, as much of Europe, to read \"Lieutenant Cook's Voyage\r\nRound the World,\" in vol. iii. of Hawkesworth's quartos, detailing the\r\ndiscoveries of June, July, and August 1770--that is close upon a\r\ncentury ago. What progress has the world made since that period! We do\r\nnot require long periods of ages to alter, to adapt, to develop the\r\ncustoms and knowledge of man. At p. 156 we get an account of a large\r\nbat. On the 23d June 1770 Cook says:--\"This day almost everybody had\r\nseen the animal which the pigeon-shooters had brought an account of the\r\nday before; and one of the seamen, who had been rambling in the woods,\r\ntold us, at his return, that he verily believed he had seen the devil.\r\nWe naturally inquired in what form he had appeared, and his answer was\r\nin so singular a style that I shall set down his own words. 'He was,'\r\nsays John, 'as large as a one-gallon keg, and very like it; he had horns\r\nand wings, yet he crept so slowly through the grass, that if I had not\r\nbeen _afeared_ I might have touched him.' This formidable apparition we\r\nafterwards discovered to have been a bat, and the bats here must be\r\nacknowledged to have a frightful appearance, for they are nearly black,\r\nand full as large as a partridge; they have indeed no horns, but the\r\nfancy of a man who thought he saw the devil might easily supply that\r\ndefect.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving seen some of the very curious fox-bats alive, and given some\r\ncondensed information about them in Dr Hamilton's series of volumes\r\ncalled \"Excelsior,\" the writer may extract the account, with some slight\r\nadditions, especially as the article is illustrated with a truly\r\nadmirable figure of a fox-bat, from a living specimen by Mr Wolf. In Sir\r\nEmerson Tennent's \"Sketches of the Natural History of Ceylon,\" p. 14, Mr\r\nWolf has represented a whole colony of the \"flying-foxes,\" as they are\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flying Fox. (Pteropus ruficollis.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOX-BATS (_Pteropus_).\r\n\r\nIn this country that bat is deemed a large one whose wings, when\r\nmeasured from tip to tip, exceed twelve inches, or whose body is above\r\nthat of a small mouse in bulk. In some parts of the world, however,\r\nthere are members of this well-marked family, the wings of which, when\r\nstretched and measured from one extremity to the other, are five feet\r\nand upwards in extent, and their bodies large in proportion. These are\r\nthe fox-bats, a pair of which were lately procured for the Zoological\r\nGardens. It is from one of this pair that the very characteristic figure\r\nof Mr Wolf has been derived.[24] There is something very odd in the\r\nappearance of such an animal, suspended as it is during the day head\r\ndownwards, in a position the very sight of which suggests to the\r\nlooker-on ideas of nightmare and apoplexy. As the head peers out from\r\nthe membrane, contracted about the body and investing it as in a bag,\r\nand the strange creature chews a piece of apple presented by its keeper,\r\nthe least curious observer must be struck with the peculiarity of the\r\nposition, and cannot fail to admire the velvety softness and great\r\nelasticity of the membrane which forms its wings. It must have been from\r\nan exaggerated account of the fox-bats of the Eastern Islands that the\r\nancients derived their ideas of the dreaded Harpies, those fabulous\r\nwinged monsters sent out by the relentless Juno, and whose names are\r\nsynonymous with rapine and cruelty.\r\n\r\nSome of these bats, before they were thoroughly known, frightened\r\nBritish sailors not a little when they met with them. We have given an\r\nanecdote, illustrative of this, in a preceding page.\r\n\r\nDr Forster, who accompanied Captain Cook on the voyage round the world\r\nfrom 1772 to 1775, observed fox-bats at the Friendly Islands, where they\r\nwere seen in large groups of hundreds. Our traveller even notices that\r\nsome of them flew about the whole day, doubtless from being disturbed by\r\nthe wandering crews of the British discovery ships. He saw a Casuarina\r\ntree of large size, the branches of which were festooned with at least\r\nfive hundred of these pendent Cheiroptera in various attitudes of ease,\r\naccording to the habits and notions of the bat tribes, who can hang\r\neither by the hind or by the fore-feet. He noticed that they skimmed\r\nover the water with wonderful facility, and he saw one in the act of\r\nswimming, though he cannot say that it did so with either ease or\r\nexpertness; they are known, however, to frequent the water in order to\r\nwash themselves from any impurities on their fur and wings, as well as\r\nto get rid of the vermin which may be infesting them.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lort Stokes found the red-necked species to be very abundant,\r\nduring his survey of the north coast of Australia in H.M.S. _Beagle_. As\r\nthe boats were engaged in the survey, flights of these bats kept\r\nhovering over them, uttering a disagreeable screeching noise and filling\r\nthe air with a faint mildewy odour, far from agreeable to the smell. The\r\nsailors gave these bats the name of \"monkey-birds,\" without being aware\r\nthat naturalists in their system consider them as following closely the\r\norder which contains these four-handed lovers of trees. Captain Stokes\r\nobserves that the leathern wings have a singular heavy flap, and that a\r\nflight of bats would suddenly alight on a bamboo and bend it to the\r\nground with their weight. Each individual struggles on alighting to\r\nsettle on the same spot, and like rooks or men in similar circumstances,\r\nthey do not succeed in fixing themselves without making a great deal of\r\nnoise. When first they clung to the bamboo, they did so by means of the\r\nclaw on the outer edge of the flying membrane, and then they gradually\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nAmong the wild and varied scenery of those groups of islands called the\r\nFriendly Islands, the Feejees, and the Navigators, species of fox-bat\r\nform one of the characteristics of the place to the observant eye;\r\nwhile, if the traveller should happen to be blind, their presence among\r\nthe otherwise fragrant forests would be readily perceived from the\r\nstrong odour which taints the atmosphere, and which, says the Naturalist\r\nof the United States Exploring Expedition, \"will always be remembered by\r\npersons who have visited the regions inhabited by these animals.\" Mr\r\nTitian Peale mentions that a specimen of the fox-bat was kept in\r\nPhiladelphia for several years; and like most creatures, winged as well\r\nas wingless, was amiable to those persons who were constantly near it,\r\nwhile it showed clearly and unmistakably its dislike to strangers.\r\n\r\nOn its voyage, this strange passenger was fed on boiled rice, sweetened\r\nwith sugar; while at the Museum, it was solaced and fed during its\r\ncaptivity chiefly on fruit, and now and then appeared to enjoy the\r\npicking from the bones of a boiled fowl. The fox-bat is but seldom\r\nbrought alive to this country. The late Mr Cross of the Surrey\r\nZoological Gardens kept one for a short time, and deemed it one of his\r\ngreatest rarities; and, till the arrival lately of the pair alluded to\r\nat the Gardens in the Regent's Park, we have not heard of other\r\nspecimens having been exhibited in this country. They are difficult to\r\nkeep, and seem to feel very sensibly the changes of our climate, while\r\nit is a hard thing to get for them the food on which they live when in a\r\nstate of liberty.\r\n\r\nMr Macgillivray discovered a new species of fox-bat on Fitzroy Island,\r\noff the coast of Australia, when he was naturalist of H.M.S.\r\n_Rattlesnake_.[25] He fell in with this large fruit-eating bat\r\n(_Pteropus conspicillatus_) on the wooded slope of a hill. They were in\r\nprodigious numbers, and presented the appearance, as they flew along in\r\nthe bright sunshine, of a large flock of rooks. As they were approached,\r\na strong musky odour became apparent, and a loud incessant chattering\r\nwas heard. He describes the branches of some of the trees as bending\r\nbeneath the loads of bats which clung to them. Some of these were in a\r\nstate of inactivity, sleeping or composing themselves to sleep, while\r\nmany specimens scrambled along among the boughs and took to flight on\r\nbeing disturbed. He shot several specimens, three or four at a time, as\r\nthey hung in clusters. Unless they were killed outright, they continued\r\nsuspended for some time; when wounded they are difficult to handle, as\r\nthey bite severely, and at such times their cry resembles somewhat the\r\nsqualling of a child. The flesh of these bats is described to be\r\nexcellent, and no wonder, when they feed on the sweetest fruits; the\r\nnatives regard it as nutritious food, and travellers in Australia, like\r\nthe adventurous Leichhardt on his journey to Port Essington, sometimes\r\nare furnished with a welcome meal from the fruit-eating fox-bats which\r\nfall in their way. Even the polished French, in the Isle of Bourbon, as\r\nthey used to call the Mauritius, sometimes stewed a Pteropus, in their\r\n_bouillon_ or broth to give it a relish.\r\n\r\nTravellers observe that in a state of nature the fox-bats only eat the\r\nripest and the best fruit, and in their search for it they climb with\r\ngreat facility along the under side of the branches. In Java, as Dr\r\nHorsfield observes, these creatures, from their numbers and fruit-eating\r\npropensities, occasion incalculable mischief, as they attack every kind\r\nthat grows there, from the cocoa-nut to the rarer and more delicate\r\nproductions, which are cultivated with care in the gardens of princes\r\nand persons of rank. The doctor observes, that \"delicate fruits, as they\r\napproach to maturity, are ingeniously secured by means of a loose net or\r\nbasket, skilfully constructed of split bamboo. Without this precaution\r\nlittle valuable fruit would escape the ravages of the kalong.\"\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned that the fox-bats are occasionally eaten in Australia.\r\nColonel Sykes alludes to the native Portuguese in Western India eating\r\nthe flesh of another species of Pteropus; and it would seem that but for\r\nprejudice, their flesh, like that of the young of the South American\r\nmonkeys, is extremely delicate; the colonel says, writing of the\r\n_Pteropus medius_, a species found in India, \"I can personally testify\r\nthat their flesh is delicate and without disagreeable flavour.\"\r\n\r\nThe Javanese fox-bat occasionally affords amusement to the colonists as\r\nwell as natives, who chase it, according to Dr Horsfield, \"during the\r\nmoonlight nights, which, in the latitude of Java, are uncommonly serene.\r\nHe is watched in his descent to the fruit-trees, and a discharge of\r\nsmall shot readily brings him to the ground. By this means I frequently\r\nobtained four or five individuals in the course of an hour.\" The natives\r\nof New Caledonia, according to Dr Forster, use the hair of these great\r\nbats in ropes, and in the tassels to their clubs, while they interweave\r\nthe hair among the threads of the _Cyperus squarrosus_, a grassy-looking\r\nplant which they employ for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dampier,[26] in 1687, observed the habits of a fox-bat on one of\r\nthe Philippine Islands, though he has exaggerated its size when he\r\njudged \"that the wings stretched out in length, could not be less\r\nasunder than seven or eight foot from tip to tip.\" He records that \"in\r\nthe evening, as soon as the sun was set, these creatures would begin to\r\ntake their flight from this island in swarms like bees, directing their\r\nflight over to the main island. Thus we should see them rising up from\r\nthe island till night hindered our sight; and in the morning, as soon as\r\nit was light, we should see them returning again like a cloud to the\r\nsmall island till sunrising. This course they kept constantly while we\r\nlay here, affording us every morning and evening an hour's diversion in\r\ngazing at them and talking about them.\" Dr Horsfield describes the\r\nspecies, which is abundant in the lower parts of Java, as having the\r\nsame habit. During the day it retreats to the branches of a tree of the\r\ngenus _Ficus_, where it passes the greater portion of the day in sleep,\r\n\"hanging motionless, ranged in succession, and often in close contact,\r\nthey have little resemblance to living beings, and by a person not\r\naccustomed to their economy, are readily mistaken for a part of the\r\ntree, or for a fruit of uncommon size suspended from its branches.\" The\r\ndoctor describes their society as being generally silent during the day,\r\nexcept when a contention arises among them to get out of the influence\r\nof the sun, when they utter a sharp piercing shriek. Their claws are so\r\nsharp, and their attachment is consequently so strong, that they cannot\r\nreadily leave their hold without the assistance of their wings, and if\r\nshot when in this position, they remain suspended.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR MAYERNE AND HIS BALSAM OF BATS.\r\n\r\nDr Mayerne, a learned English physician, who died, aged eighty-two, in\r\n1655, showed by his prescriptions that his enlightenment was not more\r\nthan that of the prevailing ignorance of the period. The chief\r\ningredient in his gout-powder was \"raspings of a human skull unburied;\"\r\n\"but,\" writes Mr Jeaffreson,[27] \"his sweetest compound was his 'balsam\r\nof bats,' strongly recommended as an unguent for hypochondriacal\r\npersons, into which entered adders, bats, sucking whelps, earth-worms,\r\nhogs' grease, the marrow of a stag, and the thigh-bone of an ox.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt the doctor imagined that a combination of the virulence,\r\nflightiness, swiftness, strength, and other qualities of all these\r\nanimals would in some mysterious way be communicated to his melancholy\r\npatient; and, indeed, by acting on the imagination of such persons a\r\nfavourable direction is given to their thoughts, and in this way their\r\nsevere malady may at times have been removed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] Illustrated Proceedings of Zoological Society.\r\n\r\n[24] This was written some years ago; but I was glad to see when last in\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, June 1866, another live specimen of a species of\r\nfox bat.\r\n\r\n[25] \"Narrative of the Voyage,\" i., p. 96 (1852).\r\n\r\n[26] \"New Voyage round the World\" (1698), p. 381.\r\n\r\n[27] \"A Book about Doctors,\" by J. Cordy Jeaffreson, i., p. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEDGEHOG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis well-armed genus of insect-eating quadruped has sometimes given to\r\ndescribing zoologists, at least so it is said, an opportunity of paying\r\na sly compliment, concealing an allusion to the _touchy_ or supposed\r\nirritable disposition of the party after whom the species has been\r\nnamed. When Southey wrote the following paragraph, he happily expressed\r\nwhat is too commonly the meaning and wish of critics and criticised. If\r\nmy readers look into any system of mammalia of recent date, under the\r\narticle _Erinaceus_, he will see one or more instances of concealed\r\nallusions to touchiness of disposition in the persons of the\r\nnaturalists, _honoured_ by the seeming compliment. The hedgehog is\r\nitself a very useful and very harmless quadruped. It is of great use in\r\na garden, and also in a kitchen frequented by crickets or black-beetles.\r\nIts food is chiefly grubs, insects, worms, and such like. The creature\r\nis easily tamed, and becomes a lovable and not a touchy pet. It is\r\neminently nocturnal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHEY AND HIS CRITICS.\r\n\r\nRobert Southey (\"Common-Place Book,\" 4th series, p.44) writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I intend to be a hedgehog, and roll myself up in my own prickles: all I\r\nregret is that I am not a porcupine, and endowed with the property of\r\nshooting them to annoy the beasts who come near enough to annoy me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most remarkable of all our quadrupeds. Its\r\nsubterranean haunts and curious aptitudes for a life below the surface\r\nof the ground are peculiarly worthy of study. The little hillocks it\r\nturns up in its excavations are noticed by every one. Its pursuit of\r\nworms and grubs, its nest, its soft plush-like fur, the pointed nose,\r\nthe strong digging fore-feet, the small all but hidden eyes, and\r\nhundreds of other properties, render it a noticeable creature. The\r\nfollowing passage from Lord Macaulay's latest writings, although rather\r\nlong, may interest some in the story of this curious creature:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOLE AND KING WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n\"A fly, if it had God's message, could choke a king.\"[28] I never knew\r\ntill the 9th January 1862, when reading vol. v. of Macaulay's England,\r\nthat a horse, stumbling on a mole-hill, was the immediate cause of the\r\ndeath of the great William III.\r\n\r\nLady Trevelyan, the sister of Macaulay, published vol. v. of her\r\nbrother's work, and added an account of the death of the illustrious\r\nDutchman, who did so much for our religious and civil liberties. The\r\nhistorian was very partial to William, and the account of that monarch's\r\nlast days is Macaulay's last finished piece: it is here quoted in full\r\nfrom the history:[29]--\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile reports about the state of the king's health were constantly\r\nbecoming more and more alarming. His medical advisers, both English and\r\nDutch, were at the end of their resources. He had consulted by letter\r\nall the most eminent physicians of Europe; and, as he was apprehensive\r\nthat they might return flattering answers if they knew who he was, he\r\nhad written under feigned names. To Fagon he had described himself as a\r\nparish priest. Fagon replied, somewhat bluntly, that such symptoms could\r\nhave only one meaning, and that the only advice which he had to give to\r\nthe sick man was to prepare himself for death. Having obtained this\r\nplain answer, William consulted Fagon again without disguise, and\r\nobtained some prescriptions which were thought to have a little retarded\r\nthe approach of the inevitable hour. But the great king's days were\r\nnumbered. Headaches and shivering fits returned on him almost daily. He\r\nstill rode, and even hunted; but he had no longer that firm seat, or\r\nthat perfect command of the bridle, for which he had once been renowned.\r\nStill all his care was for the future. The filial respect and tenderness\r\nof Albemarle had been almost a necessary of life to him. But it was of\r\nimportance that Heinsius should be fully informed both as to the whole\r\nplan of the next campaign, and as to the state of the preparations.\r\nAlbemarle was in full possession of the king's views on these subjects.\r\nHe was therefore sent to the Hague. Heinsius was at that time suffering\r\nfrom indisposition, which was indeed a trifle when compared with the\r\nmaladies under which William was sinking. But in the nature of William\r\nthere was none of that selfishness which is the too common vice of\r\ninvalids. On the 20th of February he sent to Heinsius a letter, in which\r\nhe did not even allude to his own sufferings and infirmities. 'I am,'\r\nhe said, 'infinitely concerned to learn that your health is not yet\r\nquite re-established. May God be pleased to grant you a speedy recovery.\r\nI am unalterably your good friend, WILLIAM.' These were the last lines\r\nof that long correspondence.\r\n\r\n\"On the 20th of February, William was ambling on a favourite horse named\r\nSorrel through the park of Hampton Court. He urged his horse to strike\r\ninto a gallop just at the spot where a mole had been at work. Sorrel\r\nstumbled on the mole-hill, and went down on his knees. The king fell\r\noff, and broke his collar-bone. The bone was set, and he returned to\r\nKensington in his coach. The jolting of the rough roads of that time\r\nmade it necessary to reduce the fracture again. To a young and vigorous\r\nman such an accident would have been a trifle; but the frame of William\r\nwas not in a condition to bear even the slightest shock. He felt that\r\nhis time was short, and grieved, with a grief such as only noble spirits\r\nfeel, to think that he must leave his work but half finished. It was\r\npossible that he might still live until one of his plans should be\r\ncarried into execution. He had long known that the relation in which\r\nEngland and Scotland stood to each other was at best precarious, and\r\noften unfriendly, and that it might be doubted whether, in an estimate\r\nof the British power, the resources of the smaller country ought not to\r\nbe deducted from those of the larger. Recent events had proved that\r\nwithout doubt the two kingdoms could not possibly continue for another\r\nyear to be on the terms on which they had been during the preceding\r\ncentury, and that there must be between them either absolute union or\r\ndeadly enmity. Their enmity would bring frightful calamities, not on\r\nthemselves alone, but on all the civilised world. Their union would be\r\nthe best security for the prosperity of both, for the internal\r\ntranquillity of the island, for the just balance of power among European\r\nstates, and for the immunities of all Protestant countries. On the 28th\r\nof February, the Commons listened, with uncovered heads, to the last\r\nmessage that bore William's sign-manual. An unhappy accident, he told\r\nthem, had forced him to make to them in writing a communication which he\r\nwould gladly have made from the throne. He had, in the first year of his\r\nreign, expressed his desire to see a union accomplished between England\r\nand Scotland. He was convinced that nothing could more conduce to the\r\nsafety and happiness of both. He should think it his peculiar felicity\r\nif, before the close of his reign, some happy expedient could be devised\r\nfor making the two kingdoms one; and he, in the most earnest manner,\r\nrecommended the question to the consideration of the Houses. It was\r\nresolved that the message should be taken into consideration on Saturday\r\nthe 7th of March.\r\n\r\n\"But, on the 1st of March, humours of menacing appearance showed\r\nthemselves in the king's knee. On the 4th of March he was attacked by\r\nfever; on the 5th, his strength failed greatly; and on the 6th he was\r\nscarcely kept alive by cordials. The Abjuration Bill and a money bill\r\nwere awaiting his assent. That assent he felt that he should not be able\r\nto give in person. He therefore ordered a commission to be prepared for\r\nhis signature. His hand was now too weak to form the letters of his\r\nname, and it was suggested that a stamp should be prepared. On the 7th\r\nof March the stamp was ready. The Lord Keeper and the Clerks of the\r\nParliament came, according to usage, to witness the signing of the\r\ncommission. But they were detained some hours in the ante-chamber while\r\nhe was in one of the paroxysms of his malady. Meanwhile the Houses were\r\nsitting. It was Saturday the 7th, the day on which the Commons had\r\nresolved to take into consideration the question of the union with\r\nScotland. But that subject was not mentioned. It was known that the king\r\nhad but a few hours to live; and the members asked each other anxiously\r\nwhether it was likely that the Abjuration and money bills would be\r\npassed before he died. After sitting long in the expectation of a\r\nmessage, the Commons adjourned till six in the afternoon. By that time\r\nWilliam had recovered himself sufficiently to put the stamp on the\r\nparchment which authorised his commissioners to act for him. In the\r\nevening, when the Houses had assembled, Black Rod knocked. The Commons\r\nwere summoned to the bar of the Lords; the commission was read, the\r\nAbjuration Bill and the Malt Bill became law, and both Houses adjourned\r\ntill nine o'clock in the morning of the following day. The following day\r\nwas Sunday. But there was little chance that William would live through\r\nthe night. It was of the highest importance that, within the shortest\r\npossible time after his decease, the successor designated by the Bill of\r\nRights and the Act of Succession should receive the homage of the\r\nEstates of the Realm, and be publicly proclaimed in the Council: and the\r\nmost rigid Pharisee in the Society for the Reformation of Manners could\r\nhardly deny that it was lawful to save the state, even on the Sabbath.\r\n\r\n\"The king meanwhile was sinking fast. Albemarle had arrived at\r\nKensington from the Hague, exhausted by rapid travelling. His master\r\nkindly bade him go to rest for some hours, and then summoned him to make\r\nhis report. That report was in all respects satisfactory. The States\r\nGeneral were in the best temper; the troops, the provisions, and the\r\nmagazines were in the best order. Everything was in readiness for an\r\nearly campaign. William received the intelligence with the calmness of a\r\nman whose work was done. He was under no illusion as to his danger. 'I\r\nam fast drawing,' he said, 'to my end.' His end was worthy of his life.\r\nHis intellect was not for a moment clouded. His fortitude was the more\r\nadmirable because he was not willing to die. He had very lately said to\r\none of those whom he most loved, 'You know that I never feared death;\r\nthere have been times when I should have wished it, but, now that this\r\ngreat new prospect is opening before me, I do wish to stay here a little\r\nlonger.' Yet no weakness, no querulousness disgraced the noble close of\r\nthat noble career. To the physicians the king returned his thanks\r\ngraciously and gently. 'I know that you have done all that skill and\r\nlearning could do for me, but the case is beyond your art; and I\r\nsubmit.' From the words which escaped him he seemed to be frequently\r\nengaged in mental prayer. Burnet and Tenison remained many hours in the\r\nsick-room. He professed to them his firm belief in the truth of the\r\nChristian religion, and received the sacrament from their hands with\r\ngreat seriousness. The antechambers were crowded all night with lords\r\nand privy-councillors. He ordered several of them to be called in, and\r\nexerted himself to take leave of them with a few kind and cheerful\r\nwords. Among the English who were admitted to his bedside were\r\nDevonshire and Ormond. But there were in the crowd those who felt as no\r\nEnglishman could feel, friends of his youth, who had been true to him,\r\nand to whom he had been true, through all vicissitudes of fortune; who\r\nhad served him with unalterable fidelity when his Secretaries of State,\r\nhis Treasury, and his Admiralty had betrayed him; who had never on any\r\nfield of battle, or in an atmosphere tainted with loathsome and deadly\r\ndisease, shrunk from placing their own lives in jeopardy to save his,\r\nand whose truth he had at the cost of his own popularity rewarded with\r\nbounteous munificence. He strained his feeble voice to thank\r\nAuverquerque for the affectionate and loyal services of thirty years. To\r\nAlbemarle he gave the keys of his closet and of his private drawers.\r\n'You know,' he said, 'what to do with them.' By this time he could\r\nscarcely respire. 'Can this,' he said to the physicians, 'last long?' He\r\nwas told that the end was approaching. He swallowed a cordial, and asked\r\nfor Bentinck. Those were his last articulate words. Bentinck instantly\r\ncame to the bedside, bent down, and placed his ear close to the king's\r\nmouth. The lips of the dying man moved, but nothing could be heard. The\r\nking took the hand of his earliest friend, and pressed it tenderly to\r\nhis heart. In that moment, no doubt, all that had cast a slight passing\r\ncloud over their long and pure friendship was forgotten. It was now\r\nbetween seven and eight in the morning. He closed his eyes, and gasped\r\nfor breath. The bishops knelt down and read the commendatory prayer.\r\nWhen it ended William was no more!\"\r\n\r\nIt was assuredly the stumbling of his horse against a mole-hill that led\r\nmore immediately to the death of this great monarch. It is but one link\r\nin the chain of many providences affecting his life. We all remember the\r\nschoolboy ditty--\r\n\r\n   \"For want of a nail the shoe was lost;\r\n   For want of a shoe the rider was lost;\r\n   For want of the rider the battle was lost;\r\n   For want of the battle the kingdom was lost.\"\r\n\r\nHow much the death of King William retarded progress in Great Britain\r\ncan never be judged or determined. His appointed hour had come. It was\r\nno bullet with its billet on the banks of the Boyne that laid the\r\nDutchman low, but the cast-up earth of a specimen of a little\r\ninsectivorous quadruped called the mole, which laid him on that bed from\r\nwhich he never arose.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28] Jeremy Taylor, if I remember aright.\r\n\r\n[29] Vol. V., pp. 305-310.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA most comfortably clad set of plantigrade creatures, as fond, most of\r\nthem, of fruits as they are of flesh. No creatures are more amusing in\r\nzoological gardens to children, who wonder at their climbing powers. Who\r\nis so heartless as not to have pitied the roving polar bear, caged, on a\r\nsultry July day, in a small paddock with a puddle, and wandering about\r\nrestlessly in his few feet of ground, as the well-dressed mob lounged to\r\nhear the military band performing in the Regent's Park Zoological\r\nGardens? Even young bears have an _adult_ kind of look about them. The\r\nwriter remembers the manner of one, disappointed at its bread sap, most\r\nof the milk of which had been absorbed. A little girl standing by, not\r\ntwo years old, perfectly understood what the little creature was\r\nsearching for, and, looking up, said \"milka,\" or something closely\r\nresembling it. We recently saw a little brown bear, on board a Russian\r\nship at Leith. He acted as a capital guard. The little creature had a\r\ngrown-up face, more easily observed than described.\r\n\r\nBear hams, we speak from rare experience, are truly excellent. Bears, in\r\nour early London days, were kept by many hairdressers and perfumers. The\r\nanecdote or passage from Dickens's \"Humphrey's Clock\" is very\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nIn one of Wilkie's pictures the brown bear is figured on its way with\r\nits owners to the parish beadle's \"house of detention.\" We remember the\r\nvery bear and its owners. A fine chapter might be written on the animals\r\nthat used to be led about the country by wandering foreigners. Our first\r\nsight of guinea-pigs, our first view of the black-bellied hamster, our\r\nfirst sight of the camel and dromedary, with a monkey on his neck, and\r\nour first bear, were seen in this way. Boys and girls in those days\r\nseldom saw menageries. A muzzled bear on its hind legs in Nicolson\r\nStreet, or at the Sciennes, was an exotic sight seldom witnessed, and\r\nnot easily forgotten. The last we saw was in Bernard Street, Leith, in\r\n1869. That very day, the police were hunting for Bruin and its leaders\r\nall over Edinburgh. Bears are now debarred from parading our streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AUSTRIAN GENERAL AND A BEAR.[30]\r\n\r\nMr Paget was told an excellent story of a bear hunt, which took place in\r\nthe mountains of Transylvania, and in the presence of the gentleman who\r\ntold him the story.\r\n\r\n\"General V----, the Austrian commander of the forces in this district,\r\nhad come to Cronstadt to inspect the troops, and had been invited by our\r\nfriend, in compliment to his rank, to join him in a bear hunt. Now, the\r\ngeneral, though more accustomed to drilling than hunting, accepted the\r\ninvitation, and appeared in due time in a cocked hat and long gray\r\ngreatcoat, the uniform of an Austrian general. When they had taken up\r\ntheir places, the general, with half a dozen rifles arrayed before him,\r\npaid such devoted attention to a bottle of spirits he had brought with\r\nhim, that he quite forgot the object of his coming. At last, however, a\r\nhuge bear burst suddenly from the cover of the pine forest, directly in\r\nfront of him. At that moment the bottle was raised so high that it quite\r\nobscured the general's vision, and he did not perceive the intruder till\r\nhe was close upon him. Down went the bottle, up jumped the astonished\r\nsoldier, and, forgetful of his guns, off he started, with the bear\r\nclutching at the tails of his greatcoat as he ran away. What strange\r\nconfusion of ideas was muddling the general's intellect at the moment it\r\nis difficult to say, but I suspect he had some notion that the attack\r\nwas an act of insubordination on the part of Bruin, for he called out\r\nmost lustily, as he ran along, 'Back, rascal! back! I am a general!'\r\nLuckily, a poor Wallack peasant had more respect for the epaulettes\r\nthan the bear, and, throwing himself in the way, with nothing but a\r\nspear for his defence, he kept the enemy at bay till our friend and the\r\njägers came up, and finished the contest with their rifles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBYRON'S BEAR AT CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\nWhen at Trinity College, Cambridge, Lord Byron had a strange pet. He\r\n\"brought up a bear for a degree.\" He said to Captain Medwyn,[31] \"I had\r\na great hatred of college rules, and contempt for academical honours.\r\nHow many of their wranglers have ever distinguished themselves in the\r\nworld? There was, by the by, rather a witty satire founded on my bear. A\r\nfriend of Shelley's made an ourang-outang (Oran Hanton, Esq.) the hero\r\nof a novel ('Melincourt'), had him created a baronet, and returned for\r\nthe borough of One Vote.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DICKENS ON BEARS' GREASE AND ITS PRODUCERS.\r\n\r\nAny one who has been long resident in London, or who has passed through\r\nFenchurch Street, or Everett Street, Russell Square, must have been\r\nstruck with the way in which \"bears' grease\" is or used to be advertised\r\nin these localities. Dickens makes Mr Samuel Weller tell of an\r\nenthusiastic tradesman of this description.[32]\r\n\r\n\"His whole delight was in his trade. He spent all his money in bears,\r\nand run in debt for 'em besides, and there they wos a growling away in\r\nthe front cellar all day long and ineffectually gnashing their teeth,\r\nvile the grease o' their relations and friends wos being retailed in\r\ngallipots in the shop above, and the first floor winder wos ornamented\r\nwith their heads; not to speak o' the dreadful aggrawation it must have\r\nbeen to 'em to see a man always a walkin' up and down the pavement\r\noutside, with the portrait of a bear in his last agonies, and\r\nunderneath, in large letters, 'Another fine animal was slaughtered\r\nyesterday at Jenkinson's!' Hous'ever, there they wos, and there\r\nJenkinson wos, till he was took very ill with some inward disorder, lost\r\nthe use of his legs, and wos confined to his bed, vere he laid a wery\r\nlong time; but sich wos his pride in his profession even then, that\r\nwenever he wos worse than usual the doctor used to go down-stairs, and\r\nsay, 'Jenkinson's wery low this mornin', we must give the bears a stir;'\r\nand as sure as ever they stirred 'em up a bit, and made 'em roar,\r\nJenkinson opens his eyes, if he wos ever so bad, calls out, 'There's the\r\nbears!' and rewives agin.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of a most amusing article in the seventy-seventh volume of\r\nthe _Edinburgh Review_, on the modern system of advertising, records\r\nthat, in his puff, the first vendor of bears' grease cautioned his\r\ncustomers to wash their hands in warm water after using it, to prevent\r\nthem from assuming the hairy appearance of a paw.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BEARABLE PUN.\r\n\r\nAn illiterate vendor of beer wrote over his door at Harrowgate, \"_Bear_\r\nsold here.\" \"He spells the word quite correctly,\" said Theodore Hook,\r\n\"if he means to apprise us that the article is his own _Bruin_.\"[33]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Polar Bear. (Thalassarctos maritimus.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAVED BEAR.\r\n\r\nRobert Southey (\"Common-Place Book,\" 4th ser., p. 359) says:--\"At\r\nBristol I saw a shaved monkey shown for a fairy; and a shaved bear, in a\r\ncheck waistcoat and trousers, sitting in a great chair as an Ethiopian\r\nsavage. This was the most cruel fraud I ever saw. The unnatural position\r\nof the beast, and the damnable brutality of the woman-keeper, who sat\r\nupon his knee, put her arm round his neck, called him husband and\r\nsweetheart, and kissed him, made it the most disgusting spectacle I ever\r\nwitnessed. Cottle was with me.\"\r\n\r\nHe also tells of a fellow exhibiting a dragon-fly under a magnifier at a\r\ncountry fair, and calling it the great High German \"Heiter-Keiter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLAR BEAR.\r\n\r\n(_Thalassarctos maritimus._[34])\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding ice and snow, and the darkness of a nine months' winter,\r\nthe Arctic regions are tenanted by several mammalia. Some of these are\r\nconstant residents, the rest are migratory visitors. Of the former\r\ndivision, one of the most conspicuous, as it is certainly the most\r\nformidable, is the polar bear,--a creature between eight and nine feet\r\nin length, which, shuffling along the snow at a very quick pace, and\r\nbeing an excellent swimmer besides, cannot fail to inspire dread. The\r\nlarge wide head and fearfully armed jaws are united by a strong neck to\r\npowerful shoulders, from which spring the thick and muscular fore-legs.\r\nThe paws, both of the fore and of the hind feet, are broad and admirably\r\nadapted, with their long hairy covering, to keep the polar bear from\r\nsinking in the snow. Although the creature has an appearance of\r\nclumsiness, it is the reverse of inactive. Every one who knows the\r\nboundless spaces it has to traverse, when in a state of liberty and the\r\n\"monarch of all it surveys,\" cannot but pity it as a prisoner in the\r\nRegent's Park, where a tolerably capacious den, supplied with a bath of\r\nwater of very limited dimension, affords the restless creature less\r\nliberty than a squirrel has in its round-about, or a poor lark in its\r\ncage.\r\n\r\nVoyagers to the Arctic regions describe it as wandering over the fields\r\nof ice, mounting the hummocks,[35] and looking around for prey. With\r\noutstretched head, its little but keen eye directed to the various\r\npoints of a wide horizon, the polar bear looks out for seals; or scents\r\nwith its quick nostrils the luscious smell of some stinking\r\nwhale-blubber or half-putrid whale-flesh. Dr Scoresby relates[36] that a\r\npiece of the _kreng_ of a whale thrown into the fire drew a bear to a\r\nship from the distance of miles. Captain Beechey mentions, that his\r\nparty in 1818, as they were off the coast of Spitzbergen, by setting on\r\nfire some fat of the walrus, soon attracted a bear to their close\r\nvicinity. This polar Bruin was evidently unaccustomed to the sight of\r\nmasts, and, when approaching, occasionally hesitated, and seemed half\r\ninclined to turn round and be off. So agreeable a smell as burning\r\nwalrus fat dispelled all distrust, and brought him within musket-shot.\r\nOn receiving the first ball, he sprang round, growled terrifically, and\r\nhalf raised himself on his hind-legs, as if expecting to seize the\r\nobject which had caused so much pain; woe to any one who had at that\r\nmoment been within reach of his merciless paws! Although a second and\r\nthird ball laid him writhing on the ice, he was not mastered; and on the\r\nbutt end of a musket directed at his head breaking short off, the bear\r\nquickly seized the thigh of his assailant, and, but for the immediate\r\nassistance of two or three of his shipmates, the man would have been\r\nseriously injured. In these very seas--nearly fifty years before--the\r\nhero of Trafalgar encountered this Arctic tyrant, and, when missed from\r\nhis ship, was discovered with a comrade attacking a large specimen,\r\nseparated from them by a chasm in the ice. On being reprimanded by his\r\ncaptain for his foolhardiness, \"Sir,\" said the young middy, pouting his\r\nlips, as he used to do when excited, \"I wished to kill the bear that I\r\nmight carry the skin to my father.\"[37]\r\n\r\nBarentz, in his celebrated voyage in 1595, had two of his men killed by\r\n\"a great leane white beare.\" In these early days, so unused were polar\r\nbears to man, that though thirty of their comrades attempted a rescue,\r\nthe prey was not abandoned. The purser, \"stepping somewhat farther\r\nforward, and seeing the beare to be within the length of a shot,\r\npresently levelled his peece, and discharging it at the beare, shot her\r\ninto the head, betweene both the eyes, and yet shee held the man still\r\nfast by the necke, and lifted up her head with the man in her mouth, but\r\nshee beganne somewhat to stagger; wherewith the purser and a Scottishman\r\ndrew out their courtlaxes (cutlasses), and stroke at her so hard, that\r\ntheir courtlaxes burst, and yet shee would not leave the man. At last\r\nWm. Geysen went to them, and with all his might stroke the beare upon\r\nthe snowt with his peece, at which time the beare fell to the ground,\r\nmaking a great noyse, and Wm. Geysen leaping upon her cut her throat.\r\nThe 7th of September wee buried the dead bodies of our men in the States\r\nIsland, and having fleaed the beare, carryed her skinne to Amsterdam.\"\r\n\r\nThis is about the earliest record of an encounter with this formidable\r\ncreature; sailors now find that they can be attacked with most advantage\r\nin the water. When in this element, they try to escape by swimming to\r\nthe ice, and when the ice is in the form of loose and detached small\r\nfloes, Dr Sutherland has seen them dive underneath, and appear on the\r\nopposite side. Scoresby records, that when shot at a distance, and able\r\nto escape, the bear has been observed to retire to the shelter of a\r\nhummock, and, as if aware of the styptical effect of cold, apply snow to\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\nIn common with nearly every animal, this huge despot of the North is\r\nstrongly attached to its young. Captain Inglefield, on his return home\r\nfrom Baffin's Bay in 1852, pursued three bears, as he was anxious to get\r\na supply of fresh meat for his Esquimaux dogs. The trio were evidently a\r\nmother and twins. The captain was anxious to secure the cubs alive as\r\ntrophies, and was cautious in shooting at the mother. All three fell,\r\nand were brought on board the _Isabel_. He records that it was quite\r\nheartrending to see the affection that existed between them. When the\r\ncubs saw their mother was wounded, they commenced licking her wounds,\r\nregardless of their own sufferings. At length the mother began to eat\r\nthe snow, a sure sign that she was mortally wounded. \"Even then her care\r\nfor the cubs did not cease, as she kept continually turning her head\r\nfrom one to the other, and, though roaring with pain, she seemed to warn\r\nthem to escape if possible. Their attachment was as great as hers, and I\r\nwas thus obliged to destroy them all. It went much against my feelings,\r\nbut the memory of my starving dogs reconciled me to the necessity.\"\r\n\r\nThe female bear when pursued carries or pushes her cubs forwards, and\r\nthe little creatures are described as placing themselves across her path\r\nto be shoved forwards. Scoresby mentions an instance where, when\r\nprojected some yards in advance, the cubs ran on until she overtook\r\nthem, when they alternately adjusted themselves for a second throw.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly on the seal that this bear feeds, and it displays great\r\ncunning in catching them as they sleep on the ice, or come to the holes\r\nin the ice to breathe, when it destroys them with one blow of its\r\nformidable and heavy paw. For its mode of getting the walrus we refer\r\nthe reader to \"Excelsior,\" vol. i. p. 37. Notwithstanding his strength\r\nand ferocity, the Esquimaux frequently kill the polar bear, as they\r\nesteem its flesh and fat, and highly prize its skin. The flesh is not so\r\nprized by Saxons, whether they be European or American. Dr Kane's\r\nopinion would differ but little from that of Arctic voyagers on our side\r\nof the Atlantic. The surgeon to the \"Grinnell Expedition\" in search of\r\nSir John Franklin thus characterises its flesh: \"Bear is strong, very\r\nstrong, and withal most capricious meat; you cannot tell where to find\r\nhim. One day he is quite beefy and bearable; another, hircine, hippuric,\r\nand detestable.\"\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to say that Captain Parry[38] regards the flesh of the\r\npolar bear to be as wholesome as any other, though not quite so\r\npalatable. His men suffered from indigestion after eating it; but this\r\nhe attributes to the quantity, and not to the quality, of the meat they\r\nhad eaten.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be little doubt that the liver is highly deleterious.\r\nSome of the sailors of Barentz, who made a meal of it, were very sick,\r\n\"and we verily thought we should have lost them, for all their skins\r\ncame off from the foot to the head.\"\r\n\r\nThe skin of the bear is covered with long yellowish white hair, which,\r\nis very close, and forms a wonderful defence against the cold, and\r\nagainst the tusk of the animals on which it feeds. We heard of another\r\nuse of this hair from an officer on one of the late Arctic searching\r\nexpeditions. A bear was seen to come down a tolerably high and steep\r\ndeclivity by sliding down on its hinder quarters, in an attitude known,\r\nin more than one part of the British Islands, by the expressive name of\r\n\"katy-hunkers;\" the shaggy hair with which it was covered serving like a\r\nthick mat to protect the creature from injury. The Esquimaux prepare the\r\nskin sometimes without ripping it up, and turning the hairy side inward\r\na warm sack-like bed is formed, into which they creep, and lie very\r\ncomfortably. Otho Fabricius, in his \"Fauna Grænlandica\" (p. 24), informs\r\nus that the tendons are converted into sewing threads. The female bear\r\nhas one or two, and sometimes three, cubs at a time. They are born in\r\nthe winter, and the mother generally digs for them and for herself a\r\nsnug nestling-place in the snow. The males in the winter time leave the\r\ncoast, and go out on the ice-fields, to the edge of the open water after\r\nseals.--_Adam White, in \"Excelsior\" (with additions)._\r\n\r\n\r\nNELSON AND THE POLAR BEAR.\r\n\r\nIn 1773, Captain Phipps, afterwards Lord Mulgrave, sailed on a voyage of\r\ndiscovery towards the North Pole. In this expedition sailed two Norfolk\r\nyoung men, one in his twenty-third year, the other a mere lad in his\r\nfifteenth year. The former sailed from a spirit of curiosity, and being\r\nsorely distressed by sea-sickness was landed in Norway. He afterwards\r\nbecame famous in the British Parliament, and the speeches of the Right\r\nHon. William Windham, Secretary at War, are often referred to even now.\r\nThe younger man was Horatio Nelson, cockswain under Captain Lutwidge,\r\nwho was killed at the battle of Trafalgar, thirty-two years after his\r\nPolar expedition, and left a name which is synonymous with the glory of\r\nthe British navy.\r\n\r\nSouthey, in his admirable life,[39] records an instance of his hardihood\r\non this expedition:--\"One night, during the mid-watch, he stole from the\r\nship with one of his comrades, taking advantage of a rising fog, and set\r\noff over the ice in pursuit of a bear. It was not long before they were\r\nmissed. The fog thickened, and Captain Lutwidge and his officers became\r\nexceedingly alarmed for their safety. Between three and four in the\r\nmorning the weather cleared, and the two adventurers were seen at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the ship attacking a huge bear. The signal\r\nfor them to return was immediately made; Nelsons' comrade called upon\r\nhim to obey it, but in vain; his musket had flashed in the pan; their\r\nammunition was expended; and a chasm in the ice, which divided him from\r\nthe bear, probably preserved his life. 'Never mind,' he cried; 'do but\r\nlet me get a blow at this devil with the butt-end of my musket, and we\r\nshall have him.' Captain Lutwidge, however, seeing his danger, fired a\r\ngun, which had the desired effect of frightening the beast; and the boy\r\nthen returned, somewhat afraid of the consequences of his trespass. The\r\ncaptain reprimanded him sternly for conduct so unworthy of the office\r\nwhich he filled, and desired to know what motive he could have for\r\nhunting a bear. 'Sir,' said he, pouting his lip, as he was wont to do\r\nwhen agitated, 'I wished to kill the bear, that I might carry the skin\r\nto my father.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA CLEVER POLAR BEAR.\r\n\r\nMr Markham,[40] when the ship _Assistance_ was in the Wellington\r\nChannel, observed several bears prowling about in search of seals. \"On\r\none occasion,\" he writes, \"I saw a bear swimming across a lane of water,\r\nand pushing a large piece of ice before him. Landing on the floe, he\r\nadvanced stealthily towards a couple of seals, which were basking in the\r\nsun at some little distance, still holding the ice in front to hide his\r\nblack muzzle; but this most sagacious of bears was for once outwitted,\r\nfor the seals dived into a pool of water before he could get within\r\nreach. On another occasion, a female Bruin having been shot from the\r\ndeck of the _Intrepid_, her affectionate cub, an animal about the size\r\nof a large Newfoundland dog, remained resolutely by the side of its\r\nmother, and on the approach of the commander of the _Intrepid_ with part\r\nof his crew, a sort of tournament ensued, in which the youthful bear,\r\nalthough belaboured most savagely, showed a gallant resistance, and at\r\nlength rushing between the legs of the corporal of marines, laid him\r\nprostrate on the ice, floored another man, who had seized hold of his\r\ntail, and effected his escape.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN OMMANEY AND THE POLAR BEAR.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ommaney,[41] who led one of the travelling parties in 1851 sent\r\nout from the ships under Austin in search of Franklin on the 12th of\r\nJune, the day before he arrived at the ships, met with a laughable\r\naccident, although it might have had a serious termination. They had all\r\nof them but just got into their blanket bags, when a peculiar noise, as\r\nif something was rubbing up the snow, was heard outside. The gallant\r\ncaptain instantly divined its cause, seized, loaded, and cocked his gun,\r\nand ordered the tent door to be opened, upon which a huge bear was seen\r\noutside. Captain Ommaney fired at the animal, but, whether from the\r\nbenumbed state of his limbs, or the dim glimmering light, he\r\nunfortunately missed him, and shot away the rope that supported the tent\r\ninstead. The enraged monster then poked his head against the poles, and\r\nthe tent fell upon its terrified inmates, and embraced them in its\r\nfolds. Their confusion and dismay can more easily be imagined than\r\ndescribed, but at length one man, with more self-possession than the\r\nrest, slipped out of his bag, scrambled from under the prostrate tent,\r\nand ran to the sledge for another gun; and it was well that he did so,\r\nfor no sooner had he vacated his sleeping sack than Bruin seized it\r\nbetween his teeth, and shook it violently, with the evident intention of\r\nwreaking his vengeance on its inmate. He was, however, speedily\r\ndespatched by a well-aimed shot from the man, the tent was repitched,\r\nand tranquillity restored.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] \"Hungary and Transylvania,\" &c., by John Paget, Esq., vol. ii. p.\r\n445.\r\n\r\n[31] \"Conversations of Lord Byron,\" p. 72.\r\n\r\n[32] \"Master Humphrey's Clock.\"\r\n\r\n[33] Mark Lemon, \"Jest Book,\" p. 331\r\n\r\n[34] [Greek: Thalassa], sea; [Greek: arktos], bear.\r\n\r\n[35] Those \"Arctic hedge-rows,\" as Mr David Walker calls them, when, on\r\nthe 30th November 1857, he was on board the Arctic yacht _Fox_,\r\nwintering in the floe-ice of Baffin's Bay. \"The scene apparent on going\r\non deck after breakfast was splendid, and unlike anything I ever saw\r\nbefore.

In a few years, this curious and powerful member of\r\nthe _feræ_, will figure, like the bear and beaver, as among the extinct\r\nquadrupeds of these islands. Naturalists will be recording that in the\r\ndays of Robert Burns it must have been not at all uncommon, and not rare\r\nin those of Hugh Miller, since low dram-shops kept them for the\r\nentertainment of their guests. The Ayrshire bard makes the Newfoundland\r\ndog, Cæsar, say to his comrade Luath, the collie, when, speaking of most\r\nof the gentry of his day--\r\n\r\n   \"They gang as saucy by poor folk\r\n   As I wad by a stinking brock.\"[42]\r\n\r\nThe author of \"Old Red Sandstone\" and \"My Schools and Schoolmasters,\"\r\nhas recorded in the latter work the history of his employment as a hewer\r\nof great stones under the branching foliage of the elm and chestnut\r\ntrees of Niddry Park, near Edinburgh, and how, in the course of a strike\r\namong the masons, he marched into town with several of them to a meeting\r\non the Links, where, conspicuous from the deep red hue of their clothes\r\nand aprons, they were cheered as a reinforcement from a distance. On\r\nadjourning, Hugh Miller, in his racy style, gives the following account\r\nof a badger-baiting more than forty years ago:--\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGH MILLER AND THE BADGER-BAITING IN THE CANONGATE.\r\n\r\n\"My comrades proposed that we should pass the time until the hour of\r\nmeeting in a public-house, and, desirous of securing a glimpse of the\r\nsort of enjoyment for which they sacrificed so much, I accompanied them.\r\nPassing not a few more inviting-looking places, we entered a low tavern\r\nin the upper part of the Canongate, kept in an old half-ruinous\r\nbuilding, which has since disappeared. We passed on through a narrow\r\npassage to a low-roofed room in the centre of the erection, into which\r\nthe light of day never penetrated, and in which the gas was burning\r\ndimly in a close, sluggish atmosphere, rendered still more stifling by\r\ntobacco-smoke, and a strong smell of ardent spirits. In the middle of\r\nthe crazy floor there was a trap-door, which lay open at the time; and a\r\nwild combination of sounds, in which the yelping of a dog, and a few\r\ngruff voices that seemed cheering him on, were most noticeable, rose\r\nfrom the apartment below. It was customary at this time for dram-shops\r\nto keep badgers housed in long narrow boxes, and for working men to keep\r\ndogs; and it was part of the ordinary sport of such places to set the\r\ndogs to unhouse the badgers. The wild sport which Scott describes in his\r\n'Guy Mannering,' as pursued by Dandy Dinmont and his associates among\r\nthe Cheviots, was extensively practised twenty-nine years ago amid the\r\ndingier haunts of the High Street and Canongate. Our party, like most\r\nothers, had its dog,--a repulsive-looking brute, with an earth-directed\r\neye; as if he carried about with him an evil conscience; and my\r\ncompanions were desirous of getting his earthing ability tested upon the\r\nbadger of the establishment; but on summoning the tavern-keeper, we were\r\ntold that the party below had got the start of us. Their dog was, as we\r\nmight hear, 'just drawing the badger; and before our dog could be\r\npermitted to draw him, the poor brute would require to get an hour's\r\nrest.' I need scarce say, that the hour was spent in hard drinking in\r\nthat stagnant atmosphere; and we then all descended through the\r\ntrap-door, by means of a ladder, into a bare-walled dungeon, dark and\r\ndamp, and where the pestiferous air smelt like that of a burial vault.\r\nThe scene which followed was exceedingly repulsive and brutal,--nearly\r\nas much so as some of the scenes furnished by those otter-hunts in which\r\nthe aristocracy of the country delight occasionally to indulge. Amid\r\nshouts and yells the badger, with the blood of his recent conflict still\r\nfresh upon him, was again drawn to the box-mouth; and the party\r\nreturning satisfied to the apartment above, again betook themselves to\r\nhard drinking. In a short time the liquor began to tell, not first, as\r\nmight be supposed, on our younger men, who were mostly tall, vigorous\r\nfellows, in the first flush of their full strength, but on a few of the\r\nmiddle-aged workmen, whose constitutions seemed undermined by a previous\r\ncourse of dissipation and debauchery. The conversation became very loud,\r\nvery involved, and though highly seasoned with emphatic oaths, very\r\ninsipid; and leaving with Cha--who seemed somewhat uneasy that my eye\r\nshould be upon their meeting in its hour of weakness--money enough to\r\nclear off my share of the reckoning, I stole out to the King's Park, and\r\npassed an hour to better purpose among the trap rocks than I could\r\npossibly have spent it beside the trap-door of that tavern party. I am\r\nnot aware that a single individual, save the writer, is now living; its\r\nvery dog did not live out half his days. His owner was alarmed one\r\nmorning, shortly after this time, by the intelligence that a dozen of\r\nsheep had been worried during the night on a neighbouring farm, and that\r\na dog very like his had been seen prowling about the fold; but in order\r\nto determine the point, he would be visited, it was added, in the course\r\nof the day, by the shepherd and a law-officer. The dog meanwhile,\r\nhowever, conscious of guilt,--for dogs do seem to have consciences in\r\nsuch matters,--was nowhere to be found, though, after the lapse of\r\nnearly a week, he again appeared at the work; and his master, slipping a\r\nrope round his neck, brought him to a deserted coal-pit half-filled with\r\nwater, that opened in an adjacent field, and flinging him in, left the\r\nauthorities no clue by which to establish his identity with the robber\r\nand assassin of the fold.\"[43]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAIRD OF BALNAMOON AND THE BROCK.\r\n\r\nThe laird, so Dean Ramsay had the story sent him, once riding past a\r\nhigh steep bank, stopped opposite a hole in it, and said, \"John, I saw a\r\nbrock gang in there.\"--\"Did ye?\" said John; \"wull ye haud my horse,\r\nsir?\"--\"Certainly,\" said the laird, and away rushed John for a spade.\r\nAfter digging for half an hour, he came back, nigh speechless to the\r\nlaird, who had regarded him musingly. \"I canna find him, sir,\" said\r\nJohn.--\"'Deed,\" said the laird, very coolly, \"I wad ha' wondered if ye\r\nhad, for it's ten years sin' I saw him gang in there.\"[44]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect, 1787, p. 14, \"The Twa\r\nDogs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFERRET.\r\n\r\n\r\nA truly blood-thirsty member of that slim-bodied but active race, the\r\nweasel tribe. He is certainly an inhabitant of a warmer climate than\r\nthis, being very sensitive to cold. He is used in killing rats and\r\n_ferreting out_ rabbits, a verb indeed derived from his name. He has\r\nbeen known to attack sleeping infants.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLINS AND THE RAT-CATCHERS _grip_ OF HIS FERRETS.\r\n\r\nThat delightful painter of cottage life, says his son,[45] often found\r\ncottagers who gloried in being painted, and who sat like professional\r\nmodels, under an erroneous impression that it was for their personal\r\nbeauties and perfections that their likenesses were portrayed. The\r\nremarks of these and other good people, who sat to the painter in\r\nperfect ignorance of the use or object of his labours, were often\r\nexquisitely original. He used to quote the criticism of a celebrated\r\ncountry rat-catcher, on the study he had made from him, with hearty\r\ntriumph and delight. When asked whether he thought his portrait like,\r\nthe rat-catcher, who--perhaps in virtue of his calling--was a gruff and\r\nunhesitating man, immediately declared that the face was \"not a morsel\r\nlike,\" but vowed with a great oath, that nothing could ever be equal to\r\nthe correctness of the _dirt shine on his old leather breeches_, and the\r\n_grip_ that he had of _the necks of his ferrets_!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] \"My Schools and Schoolmasters; or, The Story of my Education,\" by\r\nHugh Miller, fifth edition, 1856, pp. 321-323.\r\n\r\n[44] \"Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character,\" tenth edition,\r\n1864, p. 183.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLE-CAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn equally blood-thirsty member of the weasel family, with the subject\r\nof the preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOX AND THE POLE-CAT.--(POLL-CAT.[46])\r\n\r\nFrancis Grose relates the following as having happened during one of the\r\nfamous Westminster elections:--\"During the poll, a dead cat being thrown\r\non the hustings, one of Sir Cecil Wray's party observed it stunk worse\r\nthan a fox, to which Mr Fox replied, there was nothing extraordinary in\r\nthat, considering it was a poll-cat.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] \"Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, R.A,\" by his son, W.\r\nWilkie Collins, i. p. 222.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne who seems to love the race of dogs, and who has written a most\r\nreadable book on them,[47] remarks, that the dog \"even now is rarely the\r\ncompanion of a Jew, or the inmate of his house.\" He quotes various terms\r\nof reproach still common among us, and which seem to have originated\r\nfrom a similar feeling to that of the Jew. For instance, we say of a\r\nvery cheap article, that it is \"dog cheap.\" To call a person \"a dog,\" or\r\n\"a cur,\" or \"a hound,\" means something the very opposite of\r\ncomplimentary. A surly person is said to have \"a dogged disposition.\"\r\nAny one very much fatigued is said to be \"dog weary.\" A wretched room or\r\nhouse is often called \"a dog hole,\" or said to be only fit for \"a dog.\"\r\nVery poor verse is \"doggerel.\" It is told of Lady Mary Wortley\r\nMontague, that when a young nobleman refused to translate some\r\ninscription over an alcove, because it was in \"dog-latin,\" she observed,\r\n\"How strange a puppy shouldn't understand his mother tongue.\"\r\n\r\nWhat, too, can be more expressive of a man being on the verge of ruin,\r\nthan the common phrase, that \"such a one is going to the dogs.\" Of\r\nmodern describers of the very life and feelings of dogs, who can surpass\r\nDr John Brown of Edinburgh? His \"Rab,\" and his \"Our Dogs,\" are worthy of\r\nthe brush of Sir Edwin Landseer. Who has not heard the answer _said_ to\r\nhave been given by Sydney Smith to the great painter, when he wanted to\r\nmake a portrait of the witty canon, \"_Is thy servant a dog, that he\r\nshould do this thing?_\"\r\n\r\nThere is great diversity of standard in matters of taste. In China, a\r\nwell-roasted pup, of any variety of the very variable _Canis\r\nfamiliaris_, is a dainty dish. In London the greatest exquisite delights\r\nin the taste of a half-cooked woodcock, but would scruple to eat a\r\nlady's lap-dog, even though descended, by indubitable pedigree, from a\r\ngenuine \"liver-and-tan\" spaniel, that followed King Charles II. in his\r\nstrolls through St James's Park; and which was given to her ladyship's\r\nancestress on a day recorded, perhaps, in the diary of Mr Samuel Pepys.\r\nAgain, in the country of the Esquimaux, who has not read in the\r\nintensely interesting narratives of the Moravian missionaries, how the\r\ndogs of the \"Innuit\"--of \"the men,\" as they call themselves--are, in\r\nwinter, indispensable to their very existence? Parry, Lyon, Franklin,\r\nRichardson, Ross, Rae, Penny, Sutherland, Inglefield, and Kane, have\r\ntold us what excellent \"carriage\"-pullers these hardy children of the\r\nsnow become from early infancy; and how the more they work, like the\r\nwives of savages in Australia, the more they are kicked. Passing over\r\nthe dogs of the Indian tribes of North America and the gaunt race in\r\nPatagonia, the reader may remember that the Roman youth, like the young\r\nBriton, had, in the days of Horace, his outer marks--one was, that he\r\nloved to have a dog, or a whole pack beside him--\"_gaudet canibus_.\"\r\nThis attachment to the dog is given us \"from above,\" and is one of the\r\nmany \"good gifts\" which proceed from Him, who made man and dog\r\n\"familiar,\" as the apt specific name of Linnæus denominates the latter.\r\nOne of our greatly-gifted poets, in a cynical mood, could write an\r\nepitaph on a favourite Newfoundlander, and end it with the dismal lines\r\non his views of \"earthly friends\"--\r\n\r\n   \"He never knew but one,--and here he lies.\"\r\n\r\nOur genial and home-loving Cowper has made his dog Beau classical. We\r\nmust beg our readers to refresh their memories, by looking into the\r\nOlney bard's exquisite story,\r\n\r\n   \"My spaniel, prettiest of his race,\r\n   And high in pedigree,\"\r\n\r\nand they will find that _that_ story of \"The Dog and the Water-lily\" was\r\n\"no fable,\" and that Beau really understood his master's wish when he\r\nfetched him a water-lily out of \"Ouse's silent tide.\" How graceful are\r\nthe last two stanzas of that sweet little poem--\r\n\r\n   \"Charm'd with the sight, 'The world,' I cried,\r\n     'Shall hear of this thy deed;\r\n   My dog shall mortify the pride\r\n     Of man's superior breed.\r\n\r\n   'But chief myself I will enjoin,\r\n     Awake at duty's call,\r\n   To show a love as prompt as thine\r\n     To Him who gives me all.'\"[48]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEAU.]\r\n\r\nThat the world might know the very \"mark and figure\" of this spaniel,\r\nthe late able illustrator of so many topographical works (Mr James\r\nStorer) published in his \"Rural Walks of Cowper\"[49] a figure of Beau,\r\nfrom the stuffed skin in the possession of Cowper's kinsman, the Rev.\r\nDr Johnson.\r\n\r\nMr Montague, in a letter to the son and biographer of Sir James\r\nMackintosh,[50] gives many reminiscences of that eminent man, who was\r\nmuch attached to the memory of Cowper. He says, \"We reached Dereham\r\nabout mid-day (it was in 1801), and wrote to Mr Johnson, the clergyman,\r\nwho had protected Cowper in the last years of his life, and in whose\r\nhouse he died. He instantly called upon us, and we accompanied him to\r\nhis house. In the hall, we were introduced to a little red and white\r\nspaniel, in a glass case--the little dog Beau, who, seeing the\r\nwater-lily which Cowper could not reach, 'plunging, left the shore.'\"\r\n\r\n   \"I saw him with that lily cropp'd,\r\n     Impatient swim to meet\r\n   My quick approach, and soon he dropp'd\r\n     The treasure at my feet.\"\r\n\r\nWe saw the room where Cowper died, and the bell which he last touched.\r\nWe went to his grave, and to Mrs Unwin's, who is buried at some\r\ndistance. I lamented this, \"Do not live in the visible, but the\r\ninvisible,\" said your father,--\"his attainments, his tenderness, his\r\naffections, his sufferings, and his hardships, will live long after both\r\ntheir graves are no more.\"\r\n\r\nWe could linger over a prized octavo volume, published in Edinburgh in\r\n1787; the first poem of this, \"The Twa Dogs, a Tale,\" occupies some\r\nthirteen pages, written with that \"rare felicity\" so common to _the_\r\nBard of Scotland. We mention it, because of the peculiar happiness with\r\nwhich the collie, or Scottish shepherd-dog, is described in lines that\r\nSir Edwin Landseer alone has equalled on canvas, or his brother Thomas\r\nwith the graver--\r\n\r\n   \"He was a gash an' faithfu' tyke\r\n   As ever lap a sheugh or dyke.\r\n   His honest, sonsie, bawsn't[51] face,\r\n   Aye gat him friends in ilka place.\r\n   His breast was white, his touzie back\r\n   Weel clad wi' coat of glossy black;\r\n   His gaucie tail, wi' upward curl,\r\n   Hung owre his hurdies wi' a swirl.\"\r\n\r\n_That's_ the shepherd-dog, as we have heard him described from a\r\nspecimen, which was the friend and follower of a valued one, who, when a\r\nboy ('tis many years ago), frisked with the dog, over _one_ of the many\r\nferny haughs that margin the lovely Tweed above and below Peebles. It is\r\n_the_ collie we have seen, on one of the sheep-farms of Lanarkshire,\r\nobey its young master by a word or two, as unintelligible to us as\r\nJapanese. But to the Culter \"Luath,\" to hear was to obey; and in a\r\nquarter of an hour a flock of sheep, which had been feeding on a\r\nhillSide half a mile off, were brought back, driven by this faithful\r\n\"bit doggie.\" We wonder not that shepherds love their dogs. Why, even\r\nthe New Smithfield cattle-drovers, who drive sheep along the streets of\r\nLondon on a Monday or Friday, never even require to urge their faithful\r\npartners. Well may the gifted authoress of \"The Dream\" address \"the\r\nfaithful guardian\"--\r\n\r\n   \"Oh, tried and trusted! thou whose love\r\n     Ne'er changes nor forsakes,\r\n   Thou proof, how perfect God hath stamp'd\r\n     The meanest thing He makes;\r\n   Thou, whom no snare entraps to serve,\r\n     No art is used to tame\r\n   (Train'd, like ourselves, thy path to know,\r\n     By words of love and blame);\r\n   Friend! who beside the cottage door,\r\n     Or in the rich man's hall,\r\n   With steadfast faith still answerest\r\n     The one familiar call;\r\n   Well by poor hearth and lordly home\r\n     Thy couchant form may rest,\r\n   And Prince and Peasant trust thee still,\r\n     To guard what they love best.\"\r\n\r\n   _Hon. Mrs Norton, \"The Dream,\" &c._, p. 192.\r\n\r\nNo ordinary-sized volume, much less a short article, could give a tithe\r\nof the true anecdotes of members of the dog race. Mere references to\r\ntheir biography would take up a volume of Bibliography itself, just as\r\ntheir forms, and character, and \"pose,\" give endless subject to the\r\npainter. Of modern authors, no one loved dogs more truly than Sir Walter\r\nScott, as the reader of his writings and of his biography is well\r\naware;[52] but it may not be generally known that, on the only occasion\r\nwhen the great novelist met the Ayrshire peasant,--\r\n\r\n   \"Virgilium tantum vidi,\"--\r\n\r\nthe poem, which had made Burns a wonder to the boy then \"unknown,\" was\r\nthat of \"The Twa Dogs;\" so that, even then, Scott had commenced to show\r\nhis attachment to these faithful followers. It was in the house of Sir\r\nAdam Ferguson, when Scott was a mere lad; and the scene was described\r\nmost vividly to the writer by the late Scottish knight, after whose\r\nbattle in South Italy the author of \"Marmion\" named his pet staghound\r\nMaida, or, as Scott pronounced it, \"Myda.\" It was as the author of \"The\r\nTwa Dogs\" that young Ferguson and Scott regarded Burns on his entrance\r\ninto the room with such wistful attention. The story is told in\r\nLockhart, and we will not quote it further; but, leaving dogs of our own\r\ndays and lands to Mr Jesse, who has given an interesting volume on them,\r\nwe will close with a few paragraphs on the dog of the East--a very\r\ndifferently treated animal to that generally prized and esteemed\r\n\"friend\" of man in these lands of the West.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Scriptures show us that dogs were generally despised. We select\r\nthree, out of many instances. \"Is thy servant a _dog_ that he should do\r\nthis thing?\" was the question with which Hazael, ignorant of the\r\ndeceitfulness of his own heart, indignantly replied to Elisha, when the\r\nprophet told him of the evil that he would yet do unto the children of\r\nIsrael (2 Kings viii. 13). He, \"who spake as never man spake,\" knowing\r\nthe faith of the Syrophoenician woman, and giving her an opportunity\r\nof manifesting it \"for our example,\" said, in the Syriac fashion of\r\nthought, \"It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to\r\n_the dogs_\" (Mark vii. 27). And the apostle John, in that wondrous close\r\nof the prophetical writings, says, \"For without,\" _i.e._, outside of the\r\nNew Jerusalem, \"are _dogs_\" (Rev. xxii. 5). In the East up to the\r\npresent day, with but few exceptions, dogs are treated with great\r\ndislike. We might quote passages in proof from almost every Eastern\r\ntraveller, and may venture to extract one from the graphic page of the\r\nRev. W. Graham, who lived five years in Syria, and who has given some\r\nnoble word-pictures of men, and streets, and scenes in Damascus and\r\nother Turkish towns. Writing of Damascus,[53] he remarks, \"The dogs are\r\nconsidered unclean, and are never domesticated in the East. They are\r\nthin, lean, fox-like animals, and always at the starving point. They\r\nlive, breed, and die in the streets. They are useful as scavengers. They\r\nare neither fondled nor persecuted, but simply tolerated; and no dog has\r\nan owner, or ever follows and accompanies a man as the sheep do. I once\r\nwent out in the evening at Beyrout, with my teacher to enjoy the fresh\r\nair and talk Arabic. My little English dog, the gift of a friend,\r\nfollowed us. We passed through a garden, where a venerable Moslem was\r\nsitting on a stone, silently and solemnly engaged in smoking his pipe.\r\nHe observed the dog _following_ us, and was astonished at it, as\r\nsomething new and extraordinary; and rising, and making out of the way,\r\nhe cried out, 'May his father be accursed! Is that a dog or a fox?'\"\r\nAgain, in Damascus, should a worn-out horse, donkey, or camel die in the\r\nstreets, in a few hours the dogs have devoured it; and the powerful rays\r\nof the sun dry up all corrupt matter. Mr Graham tells us that the dogs\r\nof Damascus are brown, blackish, or of an ash colour, and that he saw no\r\nwhite or spotted specimens. He never saw a case of hydrophobia, nor did\r\nhe hear a _bark_. The dogs \"howl, and make noise enough,\" he continues,\r\n\"but the fine, well-defined _bow-wow_ is entirely wanting.\" With a quiet\r\nhumour, he hints at the bark being a mark of the civilised, domesticated\r\ndog, and as denoting, apparently, \"the refinement of canine education.\"\r\nWe have been struck with the attempts of Penny's Esquimaux dogs,\r\ndeposited by the gallant Arctic mariner in the Zoological Gardens, to\r\n_get up_ a bark somewhat like the \"well-bred\" dogs in the cages near\r\nthem. Mr Graham tells us of the Damascus dogs having established a kind\r\nof police among themselves, and, like the rooks, driving all intruders\r\nfar from their district.\r\n\r\nDogs were not always disregarded in the East. Herodotus informs us,[54]\r\nduring the Persian occupation the number of Indian dogs kept in the\r\nprovince of Babylon for the use of the governor was so great, that four\r\ncities were exempted from taxes for maintaining them. In the mountain\r\nparts of India, travellers describe the great dogs of Thibet and\r\nCashmere as being much prized.\r\n\r\n\"The domestic dog of Ladak,\" says Major Cunningham,[55] \"is the\r\nwell-known shepherd's dog, or Thibetan mastiff. They have shaggy coats,\r\ngenerally quite black, or black and tan; but I have seen some of a light\r\nbrown colour. They are usually ill-tempered to strangers; but I have\r\nnever found one that would face a stick, although they can fight well\r\nwhen attacked. The only peculiarity that I have noticed about them is,\r\nthat the tail is nearly always curled upward on to the back, where the\r\nhair is displaced by the constant rubbing of the tail.\" And that the\r\nsame massive variety was also prized in ancient times we know, by a\r\nsingularly fine, small bas-relief in baked clay, found in 1849 in the\r\nBirs-i-Nimrud, Babylon, by Sir Henry Rawlinson, which is preserved in\r\nthe British Museum, to which it was presented by the late Prince Albert,\r\nand an outline of which, reduced one-half, will convey a good idea to\r\nthe reader of its form. We may add that this bas-relief was first\r\nnoticed and figured, in 1851, in the third edition of a truly learned\r\nand excellent work on \"Nineveh and Persepolis,\" by Mr Vaux of the\r\nBritish Museum (p. 183). These dogs, then, were nothing else than big,\r\n\"low jowled\" Thibetan mastiffs, such as we occasionally see brought over\r\nby some Indian officer; and the use for which they were employed by the\r\nancient kings and their attendants is strikingly exhibited on some slabs\r\nfrom a chamber in the north palace of Koujunjik, a part of the great\r\nNineveh. On some of these slabs, dogs are seen engaged in pulling down\r\nwild asses, deer, and other animals; and they were evidently kept also\r\nto assist in securing nobler game--\"the king of beasts;\"--the sport of\r\nwhich animals shows how truly the Assyrian king was named \"Nimrod, the\r\nmighty hunter before the Lord.\"--_Adam White, in \"Excelsior\" (with\r\nadditions)._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOP BLOMFIELD BITTEN BY A DOG.\r\n\r\nHis natural temperament was quick, and he was fond of authority. \"A\r\nsaying of Sydney Smith's has been preserved, humorously illustrative of\r\nthe view which he took of Bishop Blomfield's character. The bishop had\r\nbeen bitten by a dog in the calf of the leg, and fearing possible\r\nhydrophobia in consequence, he went, with characteristic promptitude, to\r\nhave the injured piece of flesh cut out by a surgeon before he returned\r\nhome. Two or three on whom he called were not at home; but, at last, the\r\noperation was effected by the eminent surgeon, Mr Keate. The same\r\nevening the bishop was to have dined with a party where Sydney Smith was\r\na guest. Just before dinner, a note arrived, saying that he was unable\r\nto keep his engagement, a dog having rushed out from the crowd and\r\nbitten him in the leg. When this note was read aloud to the company,\r\nSydney Smith's comment was, '_I should like to hear the dog's account of\r\nthe story_.'\r\n\r\n\"When this accident occurred to him, Bishop Blomfield happened to be\r\nwalking with Dr D'Oyly, the rector of Lambeth. A lady of strong\r\nProtestant principles, mistaking Dr D'Oyly for Dr Doyle, said that she\r\nconsidered it was a judgment upon the bishop for keeping such\r\ncompany.\"[56]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"PUPPIES NEVER SEE TILL THEY ARE NINE DAYS OLD.\"\r\n\r\nIt is related, that when a former Bishop of Bristol held the office of\r\nVice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, he one day met a couple\r\nof under-graduates, who neglected to pay the accustomed compliment of\r\n_capping_. The bishop inquired the reason of the neglect. The two men\r\nbegged his lordship's pardon, observing they were _freshmen_, and did\r\nnot know him. \"How long have you been in Cambridge?\" asked his lordship.\r\n\"Only _eight_ days,\" was the reply. \"Very good,\" said the bishop;\r\n\"_puppies_ never see till they are _nine_ days old.\"[57]\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING'S DOG FLUSH.\r\n\r\nFew have written so lovingly on the dog as this gifted poetess. Her dog\r\nFlush is described so well that Landseer could paint the creature almost\r\nto a hair. She has entered into the very feeling created in us by this\r\nfavoured pet of our race. The beautiful stanzas[58] I have copied give\r\nalso many little touches of her autobiography. This gifted lady was long\r\nan invalid. She could enter with rare sympathy into Cowper's attachments\r\nto animals. Her experience of the friendship of Flush is well told in\r\nthe following lines, so different from Lord Byron's misanthropic verses\r\non his dog:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   TO FLUSH, MY DOG.\r\n\r\n   Loving friend, the gift of one\r\n   Who her own true faith has run\r\n     Through her lower nature,\r\n   Be my benediction said\r\n   With my hand upon thy head,\r\n     Gentle fellow-creature!\r\n\r\n   Like a lady's ringlets brown\r\n   Flow thy silken ears adown\r\n     Either side demurely\r\n   Of thy silver-suited breast,\r\n   Shining out from all the rest\r\n     Of thy body purely.\r\n\r\n   Darkly brown thy body is,\r\n   Till the sunshine, striking this,\r\n     Alchemise its dulness,\r\n   When the sleek curls manifold\r\n   Flash all over into gold\r\n     With a burnish'd fulness.\r\n\r\n   Underneath my stroking hand,\r\n   Startled eyes of hazel bland\r\n     Kindling, growing larger,\r\n   Up thou leapest with a spring,\r\n   Full of prank and curveting\r\n     Leaping like a charger.\r\n\r\n   Leap! thy broad tail waves a light;\r\n   Leap! thy slender feet are bright,\r\n     Canopied in fringes;\r\n   Leap! those tassell'd ears of thine\r\n   Flicker strangely, fair and fine,\r\n     Down their golden inches.\r\n\r\n   Yet, my pretty, sporting friend,\r\n   Little is 't to such an end\r\n     That I praise thy rareness;\r\n   Other dogs may be thy peers\r\n   Haply in these drooping ears\r\n     And this glossy fairness.\r\n\r\n   But of _thee_ it shall be said,\r\n   This dog watch'd beside a bed\r\n     Day and night unweary--\r\n   Watch'd within a curtain'd room,\r\n   Where no sunbeam brake the gloom,\r\n     Round the sick and dreary.\r\n\r\n   Roses gather'd for a vase\r\n   In that chamber died apace,\r\n     Beam and breeze resigning;\r\n   This dog only waited on,\r\n   Knowing that, when light is gone,\r\n     Love remains for shining.\r\n\r\n   Other dogs in thymy dew\r\n   Track'd the hares, and follow'd through\r\n     Sunny moor or meadow;\r\n   This dog only crept and crept\r\n   Next a languid cheek that slept,\r\n     Sharing in the shadow.\r\n\r\n   Other dogs of loyal cheer\r\n   Bounded at the whistle clear,\r\n     Up the woodside hieing;\r\n   This dog only watch'd in reach\r\n   Of a faintly-utter'd speech,\r\n     Or a louder sighing.\r\n\r\n   And if one or two quick tears\r\n   Dropp'd upon his glossy ears,\r\n     Or a sigh came double,\r\n   Up he sprang in eager haste,\r\n   Fawning, fondling, breathing fast\r\n     In a tender trouble\r\n\r\n   And this dog was satisfied\r\n   If a pale, thin hand would glide\r\n     Down his dewlaps sloping,\r\n   Which he push'd his nose within,\r\n   After--platforming his chin\r\n     On the palm left open.\r\n\r\n   This dog, if a friendly voice\r\n   Call him now to blither choice\r\n     Than such chamber-keeping,\r\n   \"Come out!\" praying from the door,\r\n   Presseth backward as before,\r\n     Up against me leaping.\r\n\r\n   Therefore to this dog will I,\r\n   Tenderly, not scornfully,\r\n     Render praise and favour:\r\n   With my hand upon his head\r\n   Is my benediction said,\r\n     Therefore, and for ever.\r\n\r\n   And because he loved me so,\r\n   Better than his kind will do,\r\n     Often man or woman,\r\n   Give I back more love again\r\n   Than dogs often take of men,\r\n     Leaning from my Human.\r\n\r\n   Blessings on thee, dog of mine,\r\n   Pretty collars make thee fine,\r\n     Sugar'd milk make fat thee!\r\n   Pleasures wag on in thy tail,\r\n   Hands of gentle motion fail\r\n     Nevermore to pat thee!\r\n\r\n   Downy pillow take thy head,\r\n   Silken coverlet bestead,\r\n     Sunshine help thy sleeping!\r\n   No fly's buzzing wake thee up,\r\n   No man break thy purple cup\r\n     Set for drinking deep in.\r\n\r\n   Whisker'd cats arointed flee,\r\n   Sturdy stoppers keep from thee\r\n     Cologne distillations;\r\n   Nuts lie in thy path for stones,\r\n   And thy feast-day macaroons\r\n     Turn to daily rations!\r\n\r\n   Mock I thee in wishing weal?\r\n   Tears are in my eyes to feel\r\n     Thou art made so straightly;\r\n   Blessing needs must straighten too;\r\n   Little canst thou joy or do,\r\n     Thou who lovest _greatly_.\r\n\r\n   Yet be blessèd to the height\r\n   Of all good and all delight\r\n     Pervious to thy nature;\r\n   Only _loved_ beyond that line,\r\n   With a love that answers thine,\r\n     Loving fellow-creature!\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS FOWELL BUXTON, BART., AND HIS DOG \"SPEAKER.\"\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Fowell Buxton was very fond of dogs; his son[59] tells an\r\nanecdote of the singular manner in which one of his pets came into his\r\npossession. \"He was standing at the door of the House of Commons talking\r\nto a friend, when a beautiful black and tan terrier rushed between them,\r\nand immediately began barking furiously at Mr Joseph Pease, who was\r\nspeaking. All the members jumped up, shouting and laughing, while the\r\nofficers of the house chased the dog round and round, till at last he\r\ntook refuge with Mr Buxton, who, as he could find no traces of an owner,\r\ncarried him home. He proved to be quite an original. One of his whims\r\nwas, that he would never go into the kitchen nor yet into a poor man's\r\ncottage; but he formed a habit of visiting by himself at the country\r\nhouses in the neighbourhood of Cromer, and his refined manners and\r\nintelligence made 'Speaker' a welcome guest wherever he pleased to go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD BYRON AND HIS DOG BOATSWAIN.\r\n\r\nIn November 1808 Lord Byron lost his favourite dog Boatswain; the poor\r\nanimal having been seized with a fit of madness, at the commencement of\r\nwhich so little aware was Byron of the nature of the malady, that he\r\nmore than once, with his bare hand, wiped away the slaver from the dog's\r\nlips during the paroxysms. In a letter to his friend Mr Hodson, he thus\r\nannounces this event:--\"Boatswain is dead! he expired in a state of\r\nmadness on the 18th, after suffering much, yet retaining all the\r\ngentleness of his nature to the last, never attempting to do the least\r\ninjury to any one near him. I have now lost everything except old\r\nMurray.\"\r\n\r\nThe monument raised by him to this dog--the most memorable tribute of\r\nthe kind since the dog's grave, of old, at Salamis--is still a\r\nconspicuous ornament of the gardens of Newstead. The misanthropic verses\r\nengraved upon it may be found among his poems, and the following is the\r\ninscription by which they are introduced:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"Near this spot Are deposited the remains of one Who\r\n   possessed beauty without vanity, Strength without insolence, Courage\r\n   without ferocity, And all the virtues of man without his vices. This\r\n   praise, which would be unmeaning flattery If inscribed over human ashes,\r\n   Is but a just tribute to the memory of BOATSWAIN, a dog, Who was born at\r\n   Newfoundland, May 1803, And died at Newstead Abbey, November 18, 1805.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet Pope, when about the same age as the writer of this\r\ninscription, passed a similar eulogy on his dog, at the expense of human\r\nnature; adding that \"histories are more full of examples of the fidelity\r\nof dogs than of friends.\" In a still sadder and bitterer spirit, Lord\r\nByron writes of his favourite:--\r\n\r\n   \"To mark a friend's remains these stones arise;\r\n   I never knew but _one_, and _here_ he lies.\"[60]\r\n\r\nMoore relates a story of this dog, indicative, not only of intelligence,\r\nbut of a generosity of spirit, which might well win for him the\r\naffections of such a master as Byron. A fox-terrier of his mother's,\r\ncalled Gilpin, was an object of dislike to Boatswain, who worried him\r\nnearly to the death. Gilpin was sent off and Boatswain was missed for a\r\nday. To the surprise of the servants, towards evening Gilpin and\r\nBoatswain were in company, the former led by the latter, who led him to\r\nthe kitchen fire, licked him and lavished on him every possible\r\ndemonstration of joy. He had been away to fetch him, and ever after\r\ncaressed him, and defended him from the attacks of other dogs. (P. 44.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"PERCHANCE\"--A LADY'S _reason_ FOR SO NAMING HER DOG.\r\n\r\nA lady had a favourite lap-dog, which she called Perchance. \"A singular\r\nname,\" said somebody, \"for a beautiful pet, madam; where did you find\r\nit?\"--\"Oh,\" drawled she, \"it was named from Byron's dog. You remember\r\nwhere he says, '_Perchance_ my dog will howl.'\"[61]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLINS THE ARTIST AND HIS DOG \"PRINNY\"--A MODEL OF \"_a model_.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wilkie Collins, after a most graphic account of the companions\r\nof his artist-father's home,[62] notices \"one who was ever as ready to\r\noffer his small aid and humble obedience as were any of his superiors,\r\nto confer the benefit of their penetrating advice.\" I refer to Mr\r\nCollins's dog \"Prinny\" (Prince). This docile and affectionate animal had\r\nbeen trained by his master to sit in any attitude, which the\r\nintroduction of a dog in his picture (a frequent occurrence) might\r\nhappen to demand. So strict was \"Prinny's\" sense of duty, that he never\r\nventured to move from his set position until his master's signal gave\r\nhim permission to approach his chair, when he was generally rewarded\r\nwith a lump of sugar, placed, not between his teeth, but on his nose,\r\nwhere he continued to balance it, until he was desired to throw it into\r\nthe air and catch it in his mouth, a feat which he very seldom failed to\r\nperform. On one occasion his extraordinary integrity in the performance\r\nof his duties was thus pleasantly exemplified:--\"My father had placed\r\nhim on the backs of two chairs, his fore-legs on the rails of one, and\r\nhis hind-legs on the rails of the other; and in this rather arduous\r\nposition had painted from him for a considerable time, when a friend was\r\nannounced as waiting for him in another apartment. Particularly desirous\r\nof seeing this visitor immediately, the painter hurried from the room,\r\nentirely forgetting to tell 'Prinny' to get down, and remained in\r\nconversation with his friend for full half an hour. On returning to his\r\nstudy the first object that greeted him was poor 'Prinny,' standing on\r\nhis 'bad eminence' exactly in the position in which he had been left,\r\ntrembling with fatigue, and occasionally vending his anguish and\r\ndistress in a low piteous moan, but not moving a limb, or venturing even\r\nto turn his head. Not having received the usual signal he had never once\r\nattempted to get down, but had remained disconsolate in his position\r\n'sitting' hard, with nobody to paint him, during the long half hour that\r\nhad delayed his master's return.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLDIER AND THE MASTIFF.\r\n\r\nA soldier passing through a meadow, a large mastiff ran at him, and he\r\nstabbed the dog with a bayonet. The master of the dog asked him why he\r\nhad not rather struck the dog with the butt-end of his weapon? \"So I\r\nshould,\" said the soldier, \"if he had run at me with his tail!\"[63]\r\n\r\n\r\nBARK AND BITE.\r\n\r\nLord Clare, who was much opposed to Curran, one day brought a\r\nNewfoundland dog upon the bench, and during Curran's speech turned\r\nhimself aside and caressed the animal. Curran stopped. \"Go on, go on, Mr\r\nCurran,\" said Lord Clare.--\"Oh, I beg a thousand pardons,\" was the\r\nrejoinder. \"I really thought your lordship was employed in\r\n_consultation_.\"[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS DREW AND THE TWO DOGS.\r\n\r\n(A CURIOUSLY NEAR APPROACH TO MORAL PERCEPTION.)\r\n\r\nIn the biography of Samuel Drew, A.M., a great name among the\r\nmetaphysical writers of this country, we read a very interesting\r\nanecdote of two dogs.\r\n\r\nHis father, a farmer and mail-carrier in Cornwall, had procured a\r\nNewfoundland dog for protection on his journeys, having been attacked by\r\nhighwaymen. There was a smaller dog which had been bred in the house.\r\nThe son was living at Poplea, in Cornwall, when the following\r\ncircumstance occurred, and he witnessed it:[65]--\r\n\r\n\"Our dairy was under a room which was used occasionally as a barn and\r\napple-chamber, into which the fowls sometimes found their way; and, in\r\nscratching among the chaff, scattered the dust on the pans of milk\r\nbelow, to the great annoyance of my mother-in-law. In this a favourite\r\ncock of hers was the chief transgressor. One day in harvest she went\r\ninto the dairy, followed by the little dog, and finding dust again on\r\nher milk-pans, she exclaimed, 'I wish that cock were dead!' Not long\r\nafter, she being with us in the harvest field, we observed the little\r\ndog dragging along the cock, just killed, which, with an air of triumph,\r\nhe laid at my mother-in-law's feet. Highly exasperated at the literal\r\nfulfilment of her hastily-uttered wish, she snatched a stick from the\r\nhedge, and attempted to give the dog a beating. The luckless animal,\r\nseeing the reception he was likely to meet with, where he expected marks\r\nof approbation, left the bird and ran off, she brandishing her stick,\r\nand saying, in a loud angry tone, 'I'll pay thee for this by and by.' In\r\nthe evening, when about to put her threat into execution, she found the\r\nlittle dog established in a corner of the room, and the large one\r\nstanding before it. Endeavouring to fulfil her intention by first\r\ndriving off the large dog, he gave her plainly to understand that he was\r\nnot at all disposed to relinquish his post. She then sought to get at\r\nthe small dog behind the other, but the threatening gesture, and fiercer\r\ngrowl of the large one, sufficiently indicated that the attempt would be\r\nnot a little perilous. The result was that she was obliged to abandon\r\nher design. In killing the cock I can scarcely think that the dog\r\nunderstood the precise import of my stepmother's wish, as his immediate\r\nexecution of it would seem to imply. The cock was a more recent\r\nfavourite, and had received some attentions which had previously been\r\nbestowed upon himself. This, I think, had led him to entertain a feeling\r\nof hostility to the bird, which he did not presume to indulge, until my\r\nmother's tone and manner indicated that the cock was no longer under her\r\nprotection. In the power of communicating with each other, which these\r\ndogs evidently possess, and which, in some instances, has been displayed\r\nby other species of animals, a faculty seems to be developed of which we\r\nknow very little. On the whole, I never remember to have met with a case\r\nin which to human appearance there was a nearer approach to moral\r\nperception than in that of my father's two dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIFFERENCE OF EXCHANGE.--\"DOG-CHEAP.\"\r\n\r\nDining at a nobleman's table, where the company were praising the\r\nclaret, his lordship told them that he had received that hogshead of\r\nwine in return for a couple of hounds, which he sometime before\r\npresented to Count Lauragais. \"Why, then, my lord,\" cried Foote, \"I not\r\nonly think your wine excellent, but _dog-cheap_.\"[66]\r\n\r\n\r\nGAINSBOROUGH AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR DOGS.\r\n\r\nThomas Gainsborough, the rival of Sir Joshua in portraiture, wanted that\r\nevenness of temper which the President of the Royal Academy so\r\nabundantly possessed. He was easily angered, but as soon appeased, and\r\nsays his biographer,[67] \"If he was the first to offend, he was the\r\nfirst to atone. Whenever he spoke crossly to his wife, a remarkably\r\nsweet-tempered woman, he would write a note of repentance, sign it with\r\nthe name of his favourite dog 'Fox,' and address it to his Margaret's\r\npet spaniel, 'Tristram.' Fox would take the note in his mouth, and duly\r\ndeliver it to Tristram. Margaret would then answer--'My own dear Fox,\r\nyou are always loving and good, and I am a naughty little female ever to\r\nworry you, as I too often do, so we will kiss and say no more about it;\r\nyour own affectionate Tris.'\" The writers of such a correspondence could\r\nnot have led what is called \"a cat and dog life.\" Husbands and wives\r\nmight derive a hint from this anecdote; for we know, from the old\r\nballad, that they will be sulky and quarrel at times even about getting\r\n\r\n   \"Up to bar the door, O!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM GELL'S DOG.\r\n\r\nThe reviewer[68] of Sir Thomas Browne's works says--\"We ourselves have\r\nwitnessed an example of the curious and credulous exaggeration which has\r\nconstrued certain articulations in animals into rational speech. Some\r\ntime since, in travelling through Italy, we heard, in grave earnest,\r\nfrom several Italians, of the prodigy of a Pomeranian dog that had been\r\ntaught to speak most intelligibly by Sir William Gell. Afterwards, in\r\nvisiting that accomplished and lamented gentleman at Naples, we\r\nrequested to hear an animal possessed of so unusual a gift. And, as the\r\nfriends of the urban scholar can bear witness, the dog undoubtedly could\r\nutter a howl, which, assisted by the hand of the master in closing the\r\njaw at certain inflections, might be intelligibly construed into two\r\nwords not to be repeated. Such a dog, with such an anathema in his\r\nvocabulary, would have hanged any witch in England three centuries ago.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH, THE LAST DUCHESS OF GORDON, AND THE WOLF-DOG KAISER.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. A. Moody Stuart, in his \"Life of the last Duchess of\r\nGordon,\"[69] that truly Christian lady, refers to some old pets of the\r\nduke's and her own, which, on her becoming a widow, she took with her\r\nfrom Gordon Castle to Huntly Lodge, a bullfinch, an immense Talbot\r\nmastiff named Sall, and others. He adds--\"To a stranger, the most\r\nremarkable of the duke's old favourites was Kaiser, an Hungarian\r\nwolf-dog, with a snow-white fleece, and most sheep-like aspect in the\r\ndistance, but at whose appearance out of doors, man, woman, and child\r\nfled as from a wolf. The duchess called him 'The wolf in sheep's\r\nclothing.' Her husband's tastes having brought her much into contact\r\nwith all sorts of dogs, she had learned to pat them confidently at their\r\nfirst introduction, when a large space between their eyes betokened a\r\nkindly temper. This open breadth of forehead was strongly marked in\r\nSall, a fine old mastiff that used at this time to walk round the\r\ndining-room after breakfast, with her noble head reaching the level of\r\nthe table. But the duke had chosen Kaiser for other qualities. Two of\r\nthose wolf-dogs had been brought to him for sale when travelling on the\r\nContinent; the other was the larger and handsomer animal; but Kaiser's\r\neyes, sunk deep in the head, and all but meeting under his shaggy hair,\r\nat once fixed his choice on him as 'likest his work.' That work was to\r\ndefend the sheep from the wolves, and one mode of defence was by laying\r\na strange trap for the enemy. The dog was remarkably like a sheep, his\r\nhair white without a dark speck, and he carried a great load of it, long\r\nand fleecy like wool. In the Hungarian steppes four or five of those\r\ndogs would lay themselves down on the grass in the evening, sleeping\r\nthere like so many harmless lambs, with their faces inward for the heat\r\nof each other's breath. The keen eye of the wolf was soon attracted by\r\nthe white fleeces, with no shepherd near to guard them. Eager for blood,\r\nhe careered swiftly over the plain, and sprang unsuspecting into the\r\nmidst of the flock, only to find himself clenched in the relentless jaws\r\nof Kaiser and his comrades, wolves more terrible than himself under the\r\nclothing of timid sheep. A conversation once took place at the Lodge on\r\nthe character ascribed to dogs in Scripture. It slightly vexed the good\r\nduchess that they were so often mentioned in the Bible, but only as\r\nemblems of what is foul and fierce, except in a single instance, and\r\nthat not of commendation, but neutrality. This exception, she said,\r\noccurred in the Book of Proverbs, where the greyhound is named, along\r\nwith the lion and the goat, as 'comely in going,' yet merely in praise\r\nof his external beauty. But her difficulty was relieved by the reply,\r\nthat in Isaiah lvi. 10, the \"dog\" is really used in a good sense as\r\napplied to the spiritual watchmen of the Lord's flock. For the\r\nunfaithful shepherds, being there likened to dumb dogs that cannot bark,\r\nwere not censured under the simple image of watch-dogs, but because, as\r\nsuch, they were faithless and useless; implying that the good watch-dog\r\nis an honourable emblem of the true pastor, watching for the souls\r\ncommitted to his care, and solemnly warning them of approaching danger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICK THE GREAT AND HIS ITALIAN GREYHOUNDS.\r\n\r\nDr John Moore, when travelling with the Duke of Hamilton, saw and heard\r\na good deal of Frederick the Great, and has given in his second volume\r\nof \"A View of Society and Manners in France,\" &c., many interesting\r\nparticulars of his private and public life. Among these, he alludes to\r\nhis using \"a very large gold snuff-box, the lid ornamented with\r\ndiamonds,\" and his taking \"an immoderate quantity of Spanish snuff, the\r\nmarks of which very often appear on his waistcoat and breeches. These\r\nare also liable to be soiled by the paws of two or three Italian\r\ngreyhounds, which he often caresses\" (vol. ii. p. 236).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOG AND THE FRENCH MURDERERS. (AN OCCURRENCE IN THE SPRING OF 1837.)\r\n\r\nThomas Raikes,[70] in his Journal 8th March 1837, records:--\"Eight years\r\nago, a labouring man in the department of the Loire was found murdered\r\nin a wood near his house, and his dog sitting near the body. No clue\r\ncould be gained to the perpetrators of the crime, and his widow\r\ncontinued to live in the same cottage, accompanied always by the\r\nfaithful animal. Last week two men, apparently travellers, stopped at\r\nthe house, requesting shelter from the storm, which was granted; but no\r\nsooner had the dog perceived them, than he flew at them with fury, and\r\ncould not be pacified. As they were quitting the house, one of them said\r\nto the other, 'That rascally dog has not forgotten us.' This raised the\r\nsuspicion of the widow, who overheard it, and applying to the gendarmes\r\nin the neighbourhood, they followed and arrested them. The result has\r\nbeen that, after a long examination, one of them has confessed the\r\ncrime, and impeached his associate.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHannah More wrote an ode addressed to Garrick's famous house-dog Dragon.\r\nA copy of this she gave to Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1777, while still\r\nunprinted, under an oath neither to take nor give a copy of it, which\r\noath Sir Joshua had observed (she says) like a true knight, only reading\r\nit to his visitors till some of them learned it by heart. The \"charming\r\nbagatelle\" was afterwards printed, that posterity might be enabled to\r\nwonder what a small expenditure of wit in metre sufficed to purchase a\r\nlarge modicum of fame among the blues of that day.[71]\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT HALL AND THE DOG.\r\n\r\nThe eloquent Robert Hall and Dr Leifchild were often in each other's\r\ncompany when at Bristol, travelling and preaching together at\r\nanniversaries and ordinations. The son and biographer of the latter\r\nsays:[72]--\"I rode with them from Bristol to Wells, and can now, in\r\nimagination, see Mr Hall smoking and reclining on one seat of the\r\ncarriage, while my father sat on the other. I can see Mr Hall descending\r\nat a blacksmith's shop to re-light his pipe, making his way directly to\r\nthe forge, and jumping aside with unwonted agility, when a huge dog\r\ngrowled at him. I can recall his look, when rallied on his agility,\r\nafter his return to the carriage. 'You seemed afraid of the dog, sir,'\r\nsaid my father. 'Apostolic advice, sir--Beware of dogs,' rejoined Mr\r\nHall.\" Dr Leifchild, in another part of the memoir (p. 360), relates\r\nthat some housekeeper would exclaim to him, as he was about to enter the\r\nhouse of friend or stranger, \"Don't be afraid of the dog, sir, he never\r\nbites.\"--\"Are you quite sure he never bites?\" was his prompt\r\nquestion.--\"Quite sure, sir,\" rejoined the servant.--\"Then,\" rejoined\r\nthe good-humoured doctor, \"if he never _bites_, how does he live?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA QUEEN AND HER LAP-DOG.\r\n\r\nHenrietta Maria, Queen of Charles I., on her return to Burlington Bay\r\nwith assistance for her husband, was attacked in the house where she\r\nslept by the cannonade of five ships of war belonging to the\r\nParliament. She left the house amid the whistling of balls, one of which\r\nkilled one of her servants. When on her way to the shelter of a ditch,\r\nshe remembered that an aged lap-dog, called \"Mitte,\" was left behind.\r\nShe was much attached to this old favourite, and returned to the house\r\nshe had left. Rushing up-stairs into her chamber, she caught up her old\r\npet, which was reposing on her bed, and carried her off in safety.\r\nHaving done this, the queen and her ladies gained the ditch, and\r\ncrouched down in it, while the cannon played furiously over their\r\nheads.[73]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLEVER DOG THAT BELONGED TO THE HUNTERS OF POLMOOD.\r\n\r\nThe estate of Polmood, in Peeblesshire, was the subject of extraordinary\r\nlitigation, and a volume of considerable bulk is devoted to its history.\r\nThis work contains much curious evidence from aged country folks in the\r\nwestern parts of the country. Mr Chambers[74] tells us that in the\r\nhistory \"reminiscences concerning a wonderfully clever dog are put\r\nforward as links in the line of propinquity.\" The deponent has heard his\r\nfather say that Robert Hunter had a remarkable dog called \"Algiers;\" and\r\nthat, when Robert lived at Woodend, he used to tie a napkin round the\r\ndog's neck with money in it, and send him for snuff to Lammington, which\r\nis about three miles from Woodend, and that the dog executed his\r\nmessage faithfully, and prevented everybody from laying hold of or\r\nstopping him. Another venerable deponent, aged eighty-nine, had heard\r\nhis mother tell many stories about a dog belonging to Uncle Robert,\r\nwhich went by the name of \"Algiers;\" that they used to cut a fleece off\r\nhim every year sufficient to make a pair of stockings; and that Uncle\r\nRobert used to tie a purse round his neck, with money in it, and the dog\r\nthen swam the Tweed, and brought back tobacco from the Crook! And a\r\nthird declares that \"Algiers\" could be sent to Edinburgh with a letter,\r\nand bring back a letter to his master.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH CLERGYMAN AND THE DOGS.\r\n\r\nMr Fitzpatrick, in his anecdotal memoirs of Archbishop Whately, tells a\r\nstory of an eccentric Irish parson. This person, when preaching, was\r\ninterrupted in his homily by two dogs, which began to fight in church.\r\nHe descended the pulpit, and endeavoured to separate them. On returning\r\nto his place, the clergyman, who was rather an absent man, asked the\r\nclerk, \"Where was I a while ago?\"--\"Wasn't yer Riverence appaising the\r\ndogs?\" responded the other.[75]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON IRVING AND THE DOG.\r\n\r\nPatrick Fraser Tytler, author of \"The History of Scotland,\" in a letter\r\nto his wife in 1830, says--\"At Lady Morton's, one evening, I met with\r\nWashington Irving. I had heard him described as a very silent man, who\r\nwas always observing others, but seldom opened his lips. Instead of\r\nwhich, his tongue never lay still; and he gets out more wee wordies in a\r\nminute than any ordinary converser does in five. But I found him a very\r\nintelligent and agreeable man. I put him in mind of his travelling with\r\nour dear Tommy. He had at first no recollection; but I brought it back\r\nto his memory by the incident of the little black dog, who always went\r\nbefore the horses in pulling up hill, and pretended to assist them. I\r\nput him in mind of his own wit, 'that he wondered if the doggie mistook\r\nhimself for a horse;' at which he laughed, and added, 'Yes, and thought\r\nit very hard that he was not rubbed down at the end of the\r\njourney.'\"[76]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS JERROLD AND HIS DOG.\r\n\r\nJerrold had a favourite dog that followed him everywhere. One day in the\r\ncountry, a lady, who was passing, turned round and said audibly, \"What\r\nan ugly little brute!\" Whereupon Jerrold, addressing the lady, replied,\r\n\"Oh, madam! I wonder what he thinks _about us_ at this moment.\"[77]\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERIDAN AND THE DOG.\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing the first representation of a dog-piece by Reynolds,\r\ncalled the \"Caravan,\" Sheridan suddenly came into the green-room, on\r\npurpose, it was imagined, to wish the author joy. \"Where is he?\" was\r\nthe first question; \"where is my guardian angel?\"--\"Here I am,\" answered\r\nReynolds.--\"Pooh!\" replied Sheridan, \"I don't mean _you_, I mean _the\r\ndog_.\"[78]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES LAMB AND HIS DOG.\r\n\r\nThomas Hood had a dog called \"Dash.\" This dog he gave to Charles Lamb.\r\nThe ready-witted Elia often took the creature out with him when walking\r\nat Enfield. On one occasion, the dog dashed off to chase some young\r\nsheep. The owner of the muttons came out quite indignant at the owner,\r\nto expostulate with him on the assault of Lamb's dog on his sheep. Elia,\r\nwith his quiet ready wit, replied, \"Hunt _Lambs_, sir?--why, he never\r\nhunted _me_.\"[79]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH DOGS, TIME OF LOUIS XI.--HISTORY OF HIS DOG \"RELAIS\" BY LOUIS\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, in one of his gossiping letters to the Countess of\r\nOssory in 1781, writes, \"You must not be surprised if I should send you\r\na collection of Tonton's _bons-mots_. I have found a precedent for such\r\na work. A grave author wrote a book on the 'Hunt of the Grand Senechal\r\nof Normandy,' and of _les DITS du bon chien Souillard, qui fut au Roi\r\nLoy de France onzieme du nom_. Louis XII., the reverse of the\r\npredecessor of the same name, did not leave to his historian to\r\ncelebrate his dog \"Relais,\" but did him the honour of being his\r\nbiographer himself; and for a reason that was becoming so excellent a\r\nking. It was _pour animer les descendans d'un si brave chien à se rendre\r\naussi bons que lui, et encore meilleurs_. It was great pity the Cardinal\r\nd'Amboise had no bastard puppies, or, to be sure, his Majesty would have\r\nwritten his Prime Minister's life too, for a model to his\r\nsuccessors.\"[80]\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTIN LUTHER OBSERVES A DOG AT LINTZ.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Table Talk\" of Martin Luther, it is recorded:--\"I saw a dog at\r\nLintz, in Austria, that was taught to go with a hand-basket to the\r\nbutchers' shambles for meat. When other dogs came about him, and sought\r\nto take the meat out of the basket, he set it down and fought lustily\r\nwith them; but when he saw they were too strong for him, he himself\r\nwould snatch out the first piece of meat, lest he should lose all. Even\r\nso does now our Emperor Charles; who, after having long protected\r\nspiritual benefices, seeing that every prince takes possession of\r\nmonasteries, himself takes possession of bishoprics, as just now he has\r\nseized upon those of Utrecht and Liège.\"[81]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POOR DOG AT THE GROTTA DEL CANE.\r\n\r\nHenry Matthews,[82] like other visitors of Naples, went to the\r\ncelebrated _Grotta del Cane_, or Dog Grotto, on the borders of Lake\r\nAgnano, so called from the vapour in the cave, destructive to animal\r\nlife, being shown by means of a dog. In his diary, of March 3, 1818, he\r\nrecords:--\"Travellers have made a great display of sensibility in their\r\nstrictures upon the spectacle exhibited here; but to all appearance the\r\ndog did not care much about it. It may be said, with truth of him, that\r\nhe is _used_ to it; for he dies many times a day, and he went to the\r\nplace of execution wagging his tail. He became insensible in two\r\nminutes; but upon being laid on the grass, he revived from his trance in\r\na few seconds, without the process of immersion in the lake, which is\r\ngenerally mentioned as necessary to his recovery. From the voracity with\r\nwhich he bolted down a loaf of bread which I bought for him, the vapour\r\ndoes not seem to injure the animal functions. Addison seems to have been\r\nvery particular in his experiments upon the vapour of this cavern. He\r\nfound that a pistol would not take fire in it; but upon laying a train\r\nof gunpowder, and igniting it beyond the sphere of the vapour, he found\r\nthat it could not intercept the train of fire when it had once begun\r\nflashing, nor hinder it from running to the very end. He subjected a dog\r\nto a second trial in order to ascertain whether he was longer in\r\nexpiring the first than the second time; and he found there was no\r\nsensible difference. A viper bore it _nine minutes_ the first time he\r\nput it in, and _ten minutes_ the second; and he attributes the prolonged\r\nduration of the second trial to the large provision of air that the\r\nviper laid in after his first death, upon which stock he supposes it to\r\nhave existed a minute longer the second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDOG, A POSTMAN AND CARRIER.\r\n\r\nRobert Southey says, that \"near Moffat a dog used for many years to meet\r\nthe mail and receive the letters for a little post-town near.\"[83]\r\n\r\nHow often may you see a dog carrying a basket or a parcel. No\r\nenticement, even of a dog-friend or of a great bone, will induce this\r\nfaithful servant to abandon his charge. Every one must have observed\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOG-MATIC.\r\n\r\nIn the great dispute between South and Sherlock, the latter, who was a\r\ngreat courtier, said--\"His adversary reasoned well, but he barked like a\r\ncur.\" To which the other replied, \"That _fawning_ was the property of a\r\ncur as well as barking.\"[84]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL MOREAU AND HIS GREYHOUND.\r\n\r\n\"The day after the battle of Dresden (27th Aug. 1812), a greyhound was\r\nbrought to the King of Saxony, the ally of Napoleon. The dog was moaning\r\npiteously. On the collar were engraved the words, 'I belong to the\r\nGeneral Moreau.' Where was the dog's master? By the side of the Emperor\r\nAlexander. Moreau had been mortally wounded. The dog had remained with\r\nhis master until his death. While Moreau was conversing with the Emperor\r\nAlexander a cannon-shot nearly carried off both his legs. It is said\r\nthat throughout the five days during which he lingered he uttered not a\r\nmurmur of pain.\"[85]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Solferino, where rifled cannon were first brought to\r\nbear in warfare, a dog excited great attention by its attachment to the\r\nbody of its slain master. It became the chief object in a painting of\r\nthe circumstance, from which an engraving was executed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DUKE OF NORFOLK AND HIS SPANIELS.\r\n\r\nIn Southey's \"Common-place Book,\" 4th ser. p. 479, he writes--\"Our\r\nMarlborough and King James's spaniels are unrivalled in beauty. The\r\nlatter breed (black and tan, with hair almost approaching to silk in\r\nfineness, such as Vandyke loved to introduce into his portraits) were\r\nsolely in the possession of the late Duke of Norfolk. He never travelled\r\nwithout two of his favourites in the carriage. When at Worksop he used\r\nto feed his eagles with the pups; and a stranger to his exclusive pride\r\nin the race, seeing him one day employed in thus destroying a whole\r\nlitter, told his grace how much he should be delighted to possess one of\r\nthem. The duke's reply was a characteristic one. 'Pray, sir, which of my\r\nestates should you like to have?'\"\r\n\r\nThere are shepherds who possess collies, such _proud_, useful servants\r\nand friends, that no bribe would induce them to part with them. But what\r\nold favourite dog or even bird is there that any one would part with?\r\nMan, be he scavenger or duke, is very similar in this species of\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD NORTH AND THE DOG.\r\n\r\nIn several of the caricatures published about the year 1783, when Fox\r\nand Burke had joined Lord North, and helped to form what is called the\r\nCoalition Ministry, a dog is represented. This, says Mr Wright,[86] is\r\nsaid to be an allusion to an occurrence in the House of Commons. During\r\nthe last defensive declamation of Lord North, on the eve of his\r\nresignation, a dog, which had concealed itself under the benches, came\r\nout and set up a hideous howling in the midst of his harangue. The house\r\nwas thrown into a roar of laughter, which continued until the intruder\r\nwas turned out; and then Lord North coolly observed, \"As the new member\r\nhas ended his argument, I beg to be allowed to continue mine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPERTHES DERIVES HINTS FROM HIS DOG.\r\n\r\nIn a letter, written when he first came to Gotha, Perthes, the\r\npublisher, says--\"Do not laugh if I tell you that my dog has given me\r\nmany a hint upon human nature. I never before had a dog constantly with\r\nme, and I now ask myself whether the poodle be not a man, and men\r\npoodles. I am not led to this thought by the animal propensities which\r\nwe have in common, such as eating, drinking, &c., but by those of a more\r\nrefined character. He too is cheerful and dejected, excited and supine,\r\nplayful and morose, gentle and bold, caressing and snappish, patient\r\nand refractory; just like us men in all things, even in his dreams! This\r\nlikeness is not to me at all discouraging; on the contrary, it suggests\r\na pleasing hope that this flesh and blood which plagues and fetters us,\r\nis not the real man, but merely the earthly clothing which will be cast\r\noff when he no longer belongs to earth, provided he has not sinfully\r\nchosen to identify himself with the merely material. The devil's chief\r\nseat is not in matter but in the mind, where he fosters pride,\r\nselfishness, and hatred, and by their means destroys not what is\r\ntransitory but what is eternal in man.\"[87]\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER THE GREAT AND HIS FAVOURITE DOG LISETTE.\r\n\r\nMr Stoehlin[88] relates the following anecdote of the Czar Peter, on\r\nthe authority of Miss Anne Cramer, the chambermaid to the empress. In\r\nthe cabinet of natural history of the academy at St Petersburg, is\r\npreserved, among a number of uncommon animals, Lisette, the favourite\r\ndog of the Russian monarch. She was a small, dun-coloured Italian\r\ngreyhound, and very fond of her master, whom she never quitted but when\r\nhe went out, and then she laid herself down on his couch. At his return\r\nshe showed her fondness by a thousand caresses, followed him wherever he\r\nwent, and during his afternoon nap lay always at his feet.\r\n\r\nA person belonging to the court, having excited the anger of the czar--I\r\ndo not know by what means--was confined in the fort, and there was\r\nreason to suppose that he would receive the punishment of the knout on\r\nthe first market-day. The whole court, and the empress herself, thought\r\nhim innocent, and considered the anger of the czar as excessive and\r\nunjust. Every means was tried to save him, and the first opportunity\r\ntaken to intercede in his favour. But, so far from succeeding, it served\r\nonly to irritate the emperor the more, who forbade all persons, even the\r\nempress, to speak for the prisoner, and, above all, to present any\r\npetition on the subject, under the pain of incurring his highest\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that no resource remained to save the culprit. However,\r\nthose who in concert with the czarina interested themselves in his\r\nfavour, devised the means of urging their suit without incurring the\r\npenalty of the prohibition.\r\n\r\nThey composed a short but pathetic petition, in the name of Lisette.\r\nAfter having set forth her uncommon fidelity to her master, she adduced\r\nthe strongest proofs of innocence of the prisoner, entreated the czar to\r\ntake the matter into consideration, and to be propitious to her prayer,\r\nby granting him his liberty.\r\n\r\nThis petition was tied to her collar, in such a manner as to be easily\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nOn the czar's return from the Admiralty and Senate, Lisette, as usual,\r\ncame leaping about him; and he perceived the paper, folded in the form\r\nof a petition. He took, and read it--\"What!\" said he; \"Lisette, do you\r\nalso present me petitions? Well, as it is the first time, I grant your\r\nprayer.\" He immediately sent a denthtchick[89] to the fort, with orders\r\nto set the prisoner at liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIGHT COMPANY'S POODLE AND SIR F. PONSONBY.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gronow, in his gossiping book,[90] says--\"Every regiment has a\r\npet of some sort or another. One distinguished Highland regiment\r\npossesses a deer; the Welsh Fusiliers a goat, which is the object of\r\ntheir peculiar affection, and which generally marches with the band. The\r\nlight company of my battalion of the 1st Guards in 1813 rejoiced in a\r\nvery handsome poodle, which, if I mistake not, had been made prisoner at\r\nVittoria. At the commencement of the battle of the 9th of December 1813,\r\nnear the mayor's house, not far from Bidart, we observed the gallant\r\nFrederick Ponsonby well in front with the skirmishers, and by the side\r\nof his horse the soldiers' poodle. The colonel was encouraging our men\r\nto advance, and the poodle, in great glee, was jumping and barking at\r\nthe bullets, as they flew round him like hail. On a sudden we observed\r\nPonsonby struggling with a French mounted officer, whom he had already\r\ndisarmed, and was endeavouring to lead off to our lines; when the French\r\nskirmishers, whose numbers had increased, fired several shots, and\r\nwounded Ponsonby, forcing him to relinquish his prisoner, and to retire.\r\nAt the same time, a bullet broke one of the poor dog's legs. For his\r\ngallant conduct in this affair, the poodle became, if possible, a still\r\ngreater favourite than he was before; and his friends, the men of the\r\nlight company, took him to England, where I saw my three-legged friend\r\nfor several years afterwards, the most prosperous of poodles, and the\r\nhappiest of the canine race.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRAL RODNEY AND HIS DOG LOUP.\r\n\r\nEarl Stanhope, in his History,[91] remarks--\"To those who love to trace\r\nthe lesser lights and shades of human character, I shall owe no apology\r\nif I venture to record of the conqueror of De Grasse, that even in his\r\nbusiest hours he could turn some kindly thoughts not only to his family\r\nand friends, but to his dog in England. That dog, named Loup, was of the\r\nFrench fox-breed, and so attached to his master, that when the admiral\r\nleft home to take the command of his fleet, the faithful animal remained\r\nfor three days in his chamber, watching his coat, and refusing food. The\r\naffection was warmly returned. On many more than one occasion we find\r\nRodney wrote much as follows to his wife--'Remember me to my dear girls\r\nand my faithful friend Loup; I know you will kiss him for me.'\"[92]\r\n\r\n\r\nRUDDIMAN AND HIS DOG RASCAL.\r\n\r\nGeorge Chalmers, in his Life of the learned Thomas Ruddiman,[93] tells\r\nus that \"young Ruddiman was initiated in grammar at the parish-school of\r\nBoyndie, in Banffshire, which was distant a mile from his father's\r\ndwelling; and which was then taught by George Morison, whom his pupil\r\nalways praised for his attention and his skill. To this school the boy\r\nwalked every morning, carrying his daily provisions with him. He is said\r\nto have been daily accompanied by a dog, which, when he had proceeded to\r\nthe top of Tooting-hillock, the halfway resting-place, always returned\r\nhome after partaking of his victuals. This story is still (1794)\r\nremembered, as if there were in it something supernatural. We may\r\nsuppose, however, that the excursion was equally agreeable to both\r\nparties; and when it was once known that the dog was to eat at a\r\nparticular place at a stated hour, an appropriate allowance was\r\nconstantly made for him. Whether Ruddiman had a natural fondness for\r\ndogs, or whether a particular attachment began, when impressions are\r\neasily made, which are long remembered, cannot now be ascertained. He\r\ncertainly, throughout a long life, had a succession of dogs, which were\r\ninvariably called _Rascal_; and which, being springing spaniels, ever\r\naccompanied him in all his walks. He used, with affectionate\r\nrecollection, to entertain his friends with stories of dogs, which all\r\ntended to show the fidelity of that useful animal to man.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs Schimmelpenninck, authoress of \"Select Memoirs of Port Royal,\" died\r\nin 1856. Her interesting Autobiography and Life were published in 1858\r\nby her relation, Christiana C. Hankin. In p. 467 it is remarked that\r\n\"her love of animals formed quite a feature in her daily habits. Like St\r\nFrancis, she delighted to attract the little birds, by tempting them\r\nwith dainty food upon her verandah; and it was a positive pleasure to\r\nher to watch their feast. She had a bag made, which was always filled\r\nwith oats, to regale any stray horse or ass; and she has been seen\r\nsurrounded by four goats, each standing on its hind legs, with its\r\nuplifted front feet resting on her, and all eagerly claiming the salt\r\nshe had prepared for them. But her great delight was in dogs. She never\r\nforgot those sad hours in childhood, when, unable to mix in the sports\r\nof children from illness (perhaps, too, from her want of sympathy in the\r\nusual pleasures of that age), the beautiful dogs at Barr were her\r\ncompanions and friends.\r\n\r\n\"It is no figure of speech to say that she had a large acquaintance\r\namongst the dogs at Clifton. She always carried a pocketful of biscuit\r\nto feed them; and she had a canine friend who for years was in the daily\r\nhabit of waiting at her door to accompany her morning walk, after which\r\nhe received his little portion of biscuit, and returned to his home.\r\nTimid as Mrs Schimmelpenninck was by nature and by habit, she had no\r\nidea of personal fear of animals, and especially of dogs. I have seen\r\nher go up without hesitation to some splendid specimen of the race, of\r\nwhich everybody else was afraid, to stroke him, or offer food; when the\r\nnoble creature, with that fine perception often so remarkably manifested\r\nby dogs and children, would look up in her face, and then return her\r\ncaress, and crouch down at her feet in love and confidence. Her own two\r\nbeautiful little spaniels were her constant companions in her walks;\r\ntheir happy gambols were always a source of pleasure.\"[94]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott loved dogs dearly. In his novels and poetical works his\r\nknowledge of them and his regard often appear. He loved them, from the\r\nstately deerhound to the wiry terrier. He was quite up to the ways of\r\ntheir education. Dandie Dinmont, in \"Guy Mannering,\" speaking of his\r\nterriers, says, \"I had them a' regularly entered, first wi' rottens,\r\nthen wi' stots and weasels, and then wi' the tods and brocks, and now\r\nthey fear naething that ever comes wi' a hairy skin on't.\" Then, again,\r\nread Washington Irving's description of his visit to Abbotsford, and\r\nhow, on Scott taking him out for a walk, a host of his dogs attended,\r\nevidently as a matter of course. He often spoke to them during the walk.\r\nThe American author was struck with the stately gravity of the noble\r\nstaghound Maida, while the younger dogs gambolled about him, and tried\r\nto get him to gambol. Maida would occasionally turn round suddenly, and\r\ngive one of the playful creatures a tumble, and look at Scott and\r\nIrving, as much as to say, \"You see, gentlemen, I cannot help giving way\r\nto this nonsense;\" when on he would go as grave as ever. \"I make no\r\ndoubt,\" said Scott to his companion, \"when Maida is alone with these\r\nyoung dogs, he throws gravity aside, and plays the boy as much as any of\r\nthem; but he is ashamed to do so in our company, and seems to say, \"Ha'\r\ndone with your nonsense, youngsters; what will the laird and that other\r\ngentleman think of me if I give way to such foolery?\" A little volume\r\nmight almost be made on Sir Walter Scott and his dogs. Wilkie, Allan,\r\nand especially Sir Edwin Landseer, have handed down to us the portraits\r\nof many of them. His works, and biography by Lockhart, and the writings\r\nof his many visitors, would afford many an interesting extract.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERIDAN ON THE DOG-TAX.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, a tax, which caused great discontent and ridicule, was laid for\r\nthe first time upon dogs. Mr Wright, in his \"England under the House of\r\nHanover,\" says--\"The debates on this tax in the House of Commons appear\r\nto have been extremely amusing. In opposing the motion to go into\r\ncommittee, Sheridan objected that the bill was most curiously worded, as\r\nit was, in the first instance, entitled, 'A bill for the protection of\r\nhis Majesty's subjects against dogs.' 'From these words,' he said, 'one\r\nwould imagine that dogs had been guilty of burglary, though he believed\r\nthey were a better protection to their masters' property than watchmen.'\r\nAfter having entertained the House with some stories about mad dogs, and\r\ngiving a discourse upon dogs in general, he asked, 'Since there was an\r\nexception in favour of puppies, at what age they were to be taxed, and\r\nhow the exact age was to be ascertained?' The Secretary at War, who\r\nspoke against the bill, said, 'It would be wrong to destroy in the poor\r\nthat _virtuous feeling_ which they had for their dog.' In committee, Mr\r\nLechmere called the attention of the House to ladies' 'lap-dogs.' He\r\nknew a lady who had _sixteen_ lap-dogs, and who allowed them a roast\r\nshoulder of veal every day for dinner, while many poor persons were\r\nstarving; was it not, therefore, right to tax lap-dogs very high? He\r\nknew another lady who kept one favourite dog, when well, on Savoy\r\nbiscuits soaked in Burgundy, and when ailing (by the advice of a doctor)\r\non minced chicken and sweetbread! Among the caricatures on this subject,\r\none by Gillray (of which there were imitations) represented Fox and his\r\nfriends, hanged upon a gallows, as 'dogs not worth a tax;' while the\r\nsupporters of Government, among whom is Burke, with 'G. R.' on his\r\ncollar, are ranged as well-fed dogs 'paid for.'\"[95]\r\n\r\n\r\nSYDNEY SMITH DISLIKES DOGS.\r\n\r\nAN INGENIOUS WAY OF GETTING RID OF THEM.\r\n\r\nLady Holland tells us[96] that her father, the witty canon of St Paul's,\r\ndisliked dogs. \"During one of his visits to London, at a dinner at\r\nSpencer House, the conversation turned upon dogs. 'Oh,' said my father,\r\n'one of the greatest difficulties I have had with my parishioners has\r\nbeen on the subject of dogs.'--'How so?' said Lord Spencer.--'Why, when\r\nI first went down into Yorkshire, there had not been a resident\r\nclergyman in my parish for a hundred and fifty years. Each farmer kept a\r\nhuge mastiff dog ranging at large, and ready to make his morning meal on\r\nclergy or laity, as best suited his particular taste. I never could\r\napproach a cottage in pursuit of my calling but I rushed into the jaws\r\nof one of these shaggy monsters. I scolded, preached, and prayed without\r\navail; so I determined to try what fear for their pockets might do.\r\nForthwith appeared in the county papers a minute account of the trial of\r\na farmer, at the Northampton Sessions, for keeping dogs unconfined;\r\nwhere said farmer was not only fined five pounds and reprimanded by the\r\nmagistrates, but sentenced to three months' imprisonment. The effect was\r\nwonderful, and the reign of Cerberus ceased in the land.'--'That\r\naccounts,' said Lord Spencer, 'for what has puzzled me and Althorp for\r\nmany years. We never failed to attend the sessions at Northampton, and\r\nwe never could find out how we had missed this remarkable dog case.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYDNEY SMITH ON DOGS.[97]\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't like dogs; I always expect them to go mad. A lady asked me\r\nonce for a motto for her dog Spot. I proposed, 'Out, damned Spot!' But\r\nshe did not think it sentimental enough. You remember the story of the\r\nFrench marquise, who, when her pet lap-dog bit a piece out of her\r\nfootman's leg, exclaimed, 'Ah, poor little beast! I hope it won't make\r\nhim sick.' I called one day on Mrs ----, and her lap-dog flew at my leg\r\nand bit it. After pitying her dog, like the French marquise, she did all\r\nshe could to comfort me by assuring me the dog was a Dissenter, and\r\nhated the Church, and was brought up in a Tory family. But whether the\r\nbite came from madness or Dissent, I knew myself too well to neglect it,\r\nand went on the instant to a surgeon, and had it cut out, making a mem.\r\non the way to enter that house no more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYDNEY SMITH'S \"NEWFOUNDLAND DOG THAT BREAKFASTED ON PARISH BOYS.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Sydney Smith used to be much amused when he observed the utter\r\nwant of perception of a joke in some minds. One instance we may cite\r\nfrom his \"Memoirs:\"[98] \"Miss ----, the other day, walking round the\r\ngrounds at Combe Florey, exclaimed, 'Oh, why do you chain up that fine\r\nNewfoundland dog, Mr Smith?'--'Because it has a passion for breakfasting\r\non parish boys.'--'Parish boys!' she exclaimed; 'does he really eat\r\nboys, Mr Smith?'--'Yes, he devours them, buttons and all.' Her face of\r\nhorror made me die of laughing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHEY ON DOGS.\r\n\r\nSouthey was likewise not a little attached to the memory at least of\r\ndogs, as may be inferred by the following passage in a letter to Mr\r\nBedford, Jan. 27, 1823. Snivel was a dog belonging to Mr B. in early\r\ndays. \"We had an adventure this morning, which, if poor Snivel had been\r\nliving, would have set up her bristles in great style. A foumart was\r\ncaught in the back kitchen; you may perhaps know it better by the name\r\nof polecat. It is the first I ever saw or smelt; and certainly it was in\r\nhigh odour. Poor Snivel! I still have the hairs which we cut from her\r\ntail thirty years ago; and if it were the fashion for men to wear\r\nlockets, in a locket they should be worn, for I never had a greater\r\nrespect for any creature upon four legs than for poor Sni. See how\r\nnaturally men fall into relic worship; when I have preserved the\r\nmemorials of that momentary whim so many years, and through so many\r\nremovals.\"[99]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOG, A GOOD JUDGE OF ELOCUTION.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr Leifchild, of Craven Chapel, London, was a student at Hoxton\r\nAcademy, there was a good lecturer on elocution there of the name of\r\nTrue. In the Memoir, published in 1863, are some pleasing reminiscences\r\nby Dr Leifchild of this excellent teacher, who seems to have taken great\r\npains with the students, and to have awakened in their breasts a desire\r\nto become proficients in the art of speaking. The doctor himself was an\r\nadmirable example of the proficiency thus attained under good Mr True.\r\nHe records[100] a ludicrous circumstance which occurred one day. \"In\r\nreciting Satan's address to the evil spirits from 'Paradise Lost,' a\r\nstout student was enjoined to pronounce the three words, 'Princes,\r\npotentates, warriors,' in successively louder tones, and to speak out\r\nboldly. He hardly needed this advice, for the first word came out like\r\ndistant thunder, the second like approaching thunder, and the third like\r\na terribly near and loud clap. At this last the large housedog,\r\nPompey, who had been asleep under the teacher's chair, started up and\r\njumped out of the window into the garden. 'The dog is a good judge,\r\nsir,' mildly remarked Mr True.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWPER'S DOG BEAU AND THE WATER-LILY.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATED BY THE STORY OF AS INTELLIGENT A DOG.\r\n\r\nIn _Blackwood's Magazine_ for 1818 there is an address, in blank verse,\r\nby Mr Patrick Fraser Tytler, \"To my Dog.\" Mr Tytler's brother-in-law, Mr\r\nHog,[101] recorded the fact on which this address was founded in his\r\ndiary at the time. \"Peter tells a delightful anecdote of Cossack, an\r\nIsle of Skye terrier, which belonged originally to his brother at\r\nAldourie. It was amazingly fond of his children, one of which, having\r\nfallen on the gravel and hurt itself, began to cry out. Cossack tried in\r\nvain to comfort it by leaping upon it and licking its face. Finding all\r\nhis efforts to pacify the child fruitless, he ran off to a mountain-ash\r\ntree, and leaping up, pulled a branch of red _rowan_ berries and carried\r\nit in his mouth to the child.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHORACE WALPOLE'S PET DOG ROSETTE.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, writing to Lord Nuneham in November 1773,[102]\r\nsays:--\"The rest of my time has been employed in nursing Rosette--alas!\r\nto no purpose. After suffering dreadfully for a fortnight from the time\r\nshe was seized at Nuneham, she has only languished till about ten days\r\nago. As I have nothing to fill my letter, I will send you her epitaph;\r\nit has no merit, for it is an imitation, but in coming from the heart if\r\never epitaph did, and therefore your dogmanity will not dislike it--\r\n\r\n   'Sweetest roses of the year,\r\n   Strew around my Rose's bier,\r\n   Calmly may the dust repose\r\n   Of my pretty, faithful Rose!\r\n   And if yon cloud-topp'd hill[103] behind\r\n   This frame dissolved, this breath resign'd,\r\n   Some happier isle, some humbler heaven,\r\n   Be to my trembling wishes given;\r\n   Admitted to that equal sky,\r\n   May sweet Rose bear me company!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL OF TONTON, A PET DOG, TO WALPOLE.--TONTON DOES NOT UNDERSTAND\r\nENGLISH.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, in May 1781,[104] had announced Tonton's arrival to his\r\ncorrespondent, the Hon. H. S. Conway. He says:--\"I brought him this\r\nmorning to take possession of his new villa, but his inauguration has\r\nnot been at all pacific. As he has already found out that he may be as\r\ndespotic as at St Joseph's, he began with exiling my beautiful little\r\ncat, upon which, however, we shall not quite agree. He then flew at one\r\nof my dogs, who returned it by biting his foot till it bled, but was\r\nseverely beaten for it. I immediately rung for Margaret (his\r\nhousekeeper) to dress his foot; but in the midst of my tribulation could\r\nnot keep my countenance, for she cried, 'Poor little thing; he does not\r\nunderstand my language!' I hope she will not recollect, too, that he is\r\na Papist!\" In a postscript he tells the general that Tonton \"is a\r\ncavalier, and a little of the _mousquetaire_ still; but if I do not\r\ncorrect his vivacities, at least I shall not encourage them, like my\r\ndear old friend.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter of about the same date to Mason the poet, he again alludes\r\nto his fondness of Tonton, but adds--\"I have no occasion to brag of my\r\ndogmanity.\"[105]\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, in 1774, thus refers to Margaret, in a letter to Lady\r\nOssory:--\"Who is to have the care of the dear mouse in your absence? I\r\nwish I could spare Margaret, who loves all creatures so well that she\r\nwould have been happy in the ark, and sorry when the deluge ceased;\r\nunless people had come to see Noah's old house, which she would have\r\nliked still better than cramming his menagerie.\"[106] A sly allusion to\r\nthe numerous fees Margaret got from visitors. Horace, in another of his\r\nletters, alludes to this, and, in a joke, proposes to marry Margaret to\r\nenrich himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORACE WALPOLE.--DEATH OF HIS DOG TONTON.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, writing to the Countess of Ossory, Feb. 24, 1789,[107]\r\nsays:--\"I delayed telling you that Tonton is dead, and that I comfort\r\nmyself. He was grown stone deaf, and very nearly equally blind, and so\r\nweak that the two last days he could not walk up-stairs. Happily he had\r\nnot suffered, and died close by my side without a pang or a groan. I\r\nhave had the satisfaction, for my dear old friend's sake and his own, of\r\nhaving nursed him up, by constant attention, to the age of sixteen, yet\r\nalways afraid of his surviving me, as it was scarcely possible he could\r\nmeet a third person who would study his happiness equally. I sent him to\r\nStrawberry, and went thither on Sunday to see him buried behind the\r\nchapel near Rosette. I shall miss him greatly, and must not have another\r\ndog; I am too old, and should only breed it up to be unhappy when I am\r\ngone. My resource is in two marble kittens that Mrs Damer has given me,\r\nof her own work, and which are so much alive that I talk to them, as I\r\ndid to poor Tonton! If this is being superannuated, no matter; when\r\ndotage can amuse itself it ceases to be an evil. I fear my marble\r\nplayfellows are better adapted to me, than I am to being your ladyship's\r\ncorrespondent.\" Poor Tonton was left to Walpole by \"poor dear Madame de\r\nDeffand.\" In a letter to the Rev. Mr Cole, in 1781, he announces its\r\narrival, and how \"she made me promise to take care of it the last time I\r\nsaw her. That I will most religiously, and make it as happy as is\r\npossible.\"[108]\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOP WHATELY AND HIS DOGS.\r\n\r\n\"In these rambles he was generally attended by three\r\nuncompromising-looking dogs, the heads of which, if it were possible to\r\ndraw them together in shamrock form, would forcibly suggest Cerberus.\r\nRichard Whately found, or thought he found, in the society of these dogs\r\nfar brighter intelligence, and infinitely more fidelity, than in many of\r\nthe Oxford men, who had been fulsomely praised for both.\r\n\r\n\"In devotion to his dogs, Dr Whately continued true to the end of his\r\nlife, and during the winter season might be daily seen in St Stephen's\r\nGreen, Dublin, playing at 'tig' or 'hide and seek' with his canine\r\nattendants. Sometimes the old archbishop might be seen clambering up a\r\ntree, secreting his handkerchief or pocket-knife in some cunning nook,\r\nthen resuming his walk, and, after a while, suddenly affecting to have\r\nlost these articles, which the dogs never failed immediately to regain.\r\n\r\n\"That he was a close observer of the habits of dogs and other quadrupeds\r\nwe have evidence in his able lecture on 'Animal Instinct.' Dr Whately,\r\nwhen referring to another subject, once said not irrelevantly, 'The\r\npower of duly appreciating _little_ things belongs to a great mind: a\r\nnarrow-minded man has it not, for to him they are _great_ things.' Dr\r\nWhately was of opinion that some brutes were as capable of exercising\r\nreason as instinct. In his 'Lectures and Reviews' (p. 64) he tells of a\r\ndog which, being left on the bank of a river by his master, who had gone\r\nup the river in a boat, attempted to join him. He plunged into the\r\nwater, but not making allowance for the strength of the stream, which\r\ncarried him considerably below the boat, he could not beat up against\r\nit. He landed, and made allowance for the current of the river by\r\nleaping in at a place higher up. The combined action of the stream and\r\nhis swimming carried him in an oblique direction, and he thus reached\r\nthe boat. Dr Whately adopts the following conclusion--'It appears, then,\r\nthat we can neither deny reason universally and altogether to brutes,\r\nnor instinct to man; but that each possesses a share of both, though in\r\nvery different proportions.'\"[109]\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR DAVID WILKIE COULD NOT SEE A PUN.--\"A DOG-ROSE.\"\r\n\r\nThe son and biographer of William Collins, the Royal Academician,[110]\r\nquotes from a manuscript collection of anecdotes, written by that\r\ncharming painter of country life and landscape, the following on Sir\r\nDavid Wilkie:--\"Wilkie was not quick in perceiving a joke, although he\r\nwas always anxious to do so, and to recollect humorous stories, of which\r\nhe was exceedingly fond. As instances, I recollect once when we were\r\nstaying at Mr Wells's, at Redleaf, one morning at breakfast a very small\r\npuppy was running about under the table. 'Dear me,' said a lady, 'how\r\nthis creature teases me!' I took it up and put it into my breast-pocket.\r\nMr Wells said, 'That is a pretty nosegay.'--'Yes,' said I, 'it is a\r\ndog-rose.' Wilkie's attention, sitting opposite, was called to his\r\nfriend's pun, but all in vain. He could not be persuaded to see anything\r\nin it. I recollect trying once to explain to him, with the same want of\r\nsuccess, Hogarth's joke in putting the sign of the woman without a head\r\n('The Good Woman') under the window from which the quarrelsome wife is\r\nthrowing the dinner into the street.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nULYSSES AND HIS DOG.\r\n\r\nRichard Payne Knight, in his \"Inquiry into the Principles of\r\nTaste,\"[111] when treating of the \"sublime and pathetic,\" quotes the\r\nstory of Ulysses and his dog, as follows:--\"No Dutch painter ever\r\nexhibited an image less imposing, or less calculated to inspire awe and\r\nterror, or any other of Burke's symptoms or sources of the sublime\r\n(unless, indeed, it be a stink), than the celebrated dog of Ulysses\r\nlying upon a dunghill, covered with vermin and in the agonies of death;\r\nyet, when in such circumstances, on hearing the voice of his old master,\r\nwho had been absent twenty years, he pricks his ears, wags his tail, and\r\nexpires, what heart is not at once melted, elevated, and expanded with\r\nall those glowing feelings which Longinus has so well described as the\r\ngenuine effects of the true sublime? That master, too--the patient,\r\ncrafty, and obdurate Ulysses, who encounters every danger and bears\r\nevery calamity with a constancy unshaken, a spirit undepressed, and a\r\ntemper unruffled--when he sees this faithful old servant perishing in\r\nwant, misery, and neglect, yet still remembering his long-lost\r\nbenefactor, and collecting the last effort of expiring nature to give a\r\nsign of joy and gratulation at his return, hides his face and wipes away\r\nthe tear! This is true sublimity of character, which is always mixed\r\nwith tenderness--mere sanguinary ferocity being terrible and odious, but\r\nnever sublime. [Greek: Agathoi polydakrytoi andres]--_Men prone to tears\r\nare brave_, says the proverbial Greek hemistich; for courage, which does\r\nnot arise from mere coarseness of organisation, but from that sense of\r\ndignity and honour which constitutes the generous pride of a high mind,\r\nis founded in sensibility.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] \"The Olio,\" by the late Francis Grose, Esq., F.A.S., p. 203.\r\n\r\n[47] \"Dogs and their Ways;\" illustrated by numerous anecdotes, compiled\r\nfrom authentic sources, by the Rev.

How closely allied the wolf is to the\r\ndog may be clearly read in the accounts of Polar winterings. Some of the\r\nlarger butchers' dogs are singularly wolf-like, and it seems to be\r\n_that_ variety which occasionally, as it were, resumes its wolfish\r\nhabits of prowling at night and killing numbers of sheep in certain\r\ndistricts, as we sometimes read in the country papers of the day. In\r\nStrathearn, we lately heard of a very recent instance of this wolf-like\r\nferocity breaking out. The dog was traced with great difficulty, and at\r\nlast shot. He proved to be of the kind alluded to.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLSON AND THE LAST SCOTTISH WOLF.\r\n\r\nMr Scrope[112] describes, from traditions still existing on the east\r\ncoast of Sutherland, the destruction of what is supposed to have been\r\nthe last Scottish wolf and her cubs. This was between 1690 and 1700.\r\nThis wolf had committed many depredations on their flocks, and the\r\ninhabitants had been unsuccessful in their attempts to hunt it down.\r\n\r\nA man named Polson, attended by two herd boys, went in search of it.\r\n\r\nPolson was an old hunter, and had much experience in tracing and\r\ndestroying wolves and other predatory animals. Forming his own\r\nconjectures, he proceeded at once to the wild and rugged ground that\r\nsurrounds the rocky mountain-gulley which forms the channel of the burn\r\nof Sledale. Here, after a minute investigation, he discovered a narrow\r\nfissure in the midst of a confused mass of large fragments of rock,\r\nwhich, upon examination, he had reason to think might lead to a larger\r\nopening or cavern below, which the wolf might use as his den. Stones\r\nwere now thrown down, and other means resorted to, to rouse any animal\r\nthat might be lurking within. Nothing formidable appearing, the two lads\r\ncontrived to squeeze themselves through the fissure, that they might\r\nexamine the interior, while Polson kept guard on the outside. The boys\r\ndescended through the narrow passage into a small cavern, which was\r\nevidently a wolf's den, for the ground was covered with bones and horns\r\nof animals, feathers, and egg-shells; and the dark space was somewhat\r\nenlivened by five or six active wolf cubs. Not a little dubious of the\r\nevent, the voices of the poor boys came up hollow and anxious from\r\nbelow, communicating this intelligence. Polson at once desired them to\r\ndo their best, and to destroy the cubs. Soon after, he heard the feeble\r\nhowling of the whelps as they were attacked below, and saw almost at the\r\nsame time, to his great horror, a full-grown wolf, evidently the dam,\r\nraging furiously at the cries of her young, and now close upon the mouth\r\nof the cavern, which she had approached unobserved, among the rocky\r\nirregularities of the place. She attempted to leap down at one bound\r\nfrom the spot where she was first seen. In this emergency, Polson\r\ninstinctively threw himself forward on the wolf, and succeeded in\r\ncatching a firm hold of the animal's long and bushy tail, just as the\r\nforepart of the body was within the narrow entrance of the cavern. He\r\nhad unluckily placed his gun against a rock, when aiding the boys in\r\ntheir descent, and could not now reach it. Without apprising the lads\r\nbelow of their imminent peril, the stout hunter kept firm grip of the\r\nwolf's tail, which he wound round his left arm; and although the\r\nmaddened brute scrambled, and twisted, and strove with all her might to\r\nforce herself down to the rescue of her cubs, Polson was just able, with\r\nthe exertion of all his strength, to keep her from going forward. In the\r\nmidst of this singular struggle, which passed in silence--for the wolf\r\nwas mute, and the hunter, either from the engrossing nature of his\r\nexertions, or from his unwillingness to alarm the boys, spoke not a word\r\nat the commencement of the conflict--his son within the cave, finding\r\nthe light excluded from above, asked in Gaelic, and in an abrupt tone,\r\n\"Father, what is keeping the light from us?\"--\"If the root of the tail\r\nbreak,\" replied he, \"you will soon know that.\" Before long, however, the\r\nman contrived to get hold of his hunting-knife, and stabbed the wolf in\r\nthe most vital parts he could reach. The enraged animal now attempted to\r\nturn and face her foe, but the hole was too narrow to allow of this; and\r\nwhen Polson saw his danger, he squeezed her forward, keeping her jammed\r\nin, whilst he repeated his stabs as rapidly as he could, until the\r\nanimal, being mortally wounded, was easily dragged back and finished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA similar story has been given, with the wilds of Canada for the scene.\r\nThe young Highlander was said to be dirking pigs, while the father was\r\nkeeping guard. \"Phat's keeping out the licht, fayther?\" shouts the\r\nson.--\"If ta tail preaks, tou 'lt fine tat,\" were the question and\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] \"The Art of Deer-Stalking,\" &c., by William Scrope, Esq., F.L.S.,\r\np. 371.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sharp-faced fox is a very epitome of cunning, and his name is a\r\nby-word for slyness. Farmers know well that no fox, nestling close to\r\ntheir houses, ever meddles with their poultry. Reynard rambles a good\r\nway from home before he begins to plunder. How admirable is Professor\r\nWilson's description of fox-hunting, quoted here from the \"Noctes.\" Sir\r\nWalter Scott, in one of his topographical essays, has given a curious\r\naccount of the way in which a fox, acquainted with the \"ins and outs\" of\r\na certain old castle, outwitted a whole pack of dogs, who had to jump up\r\nsingly to get through a small window to which Reynard led them. His\r\nlarge tail, so bushy and so free, is of great use to Reynard. He often\r\nbrushes the eyes of his pursuers with it when sprinkled with water\r\nanything but sweet, and which, by its pungency, for a time blinds them.\r\nThe pursuit of the fox is most exciting, and turns out the lord \"of high\r\ndegree,\" and the country squire and farmer. It is the most\r\ncharacteristic sport of the \"better classes\" in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ENTHUSIASTIC FOX-HUNTING SURGEON.[113]\r\n\r\nA medical gentleman, named Hansted, residing near Newbury, who was very\r\nfond of fox-hunting, ordered his gardener to set a trap for some vermin\r\nthat infested his garden. As ill luck would have it, a fox was found in\r\nthe morning with his leg broken, instead of a plant-eating rabbit. The\r\ngardener took Reynard to the doctor, when he exclaimed, \"Why did you not\r\ncall me up in the night, that I might have set the leg?\" Better late\r\nthan never: the surgeon set the leg; the fox recovered, and was killed\r\nin due form, after a capital run.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOX-HUNTING.\r\n\r\n(_From the \"Noctes Ambrosianæ,\" April 1826._[114])\r\n\r\n_North._ It seems fox-hunting, too, is cruel.\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ To wham? Is't cruel to dowgs, to feed fifty or sixty o' them\r\non crackers and ither sorts o' food, in a kennel like a Christian house,\r\nwi' a clear burn flowin' through 't, and to gie them, twice a-week or\r\naftener, during the season, a brattlin rin o' thretty miles after a fox?\r\nIs that cruelty to dowgs?\r\n\r\n_North._ But the fox, James?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ We'll come to the fox by and by. Is't cruel to horses, to\r\nbuy a hundred o' them for ae hunt, rarely for less than a hundred pounds\r\neach, and aften for five hundred--to feed them on five or sax feeds o'\r\ncorn _per diem_--and to gie them skins as sleek as satin--and to gar\r\nthem nicher (_neigh_) wi' fu'ness o' bluid, sae that every vein in their\r\nbodies starts like sinnies (_sinews_)--and to gallop them like deevils\r\nin a hurricane, up hill and doun brae, and loup or soom canals and\r\nrivers, and flee ower hedges, and dikes, and palings, like birds, and\r\ndrive crashin' through woods, like elephants or rhinoceroses--a' the\r\nwhile every coorser flingin' fire-flaughts (_flakes_) frae his een, and\r\nwhitening the sweat o' speed wi' the foam o' fury--I say, ca' you that\r\ncruelty to horses, when the hunt charge with all their chivalry, and\r\nplain, mountain, or forest are shook by the quadrupedal thunder?\r\n\r\n_North._ But the fox, James?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ We'll come to the fox by and by. Is 't cruel to\r\nmen to inspirit wi' a rampagin happiness fivescore o' the flower o'\r\nEngland or Scotland's youth, a' wi' caps and red coats, and whups in\r\ntheir hauns--a troop o' lauchin, tearin', tallyhoin' \"wild and wayward\r\nhumorists,\" as the doctor ca'd them the tither Sunday?\r\n\r\n_North._ I like the expression, James.\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ So do I, or I would not have quoted it. But it's just as\r\napplicable to a set o' outrageous ministers, eatin' and drinkin', and\r\nguffawin' at a Presbytery denner.\r\n\r\n_North._ But the fox, James?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ We'll come to the fox by and by. Is't cruel to the lambs,\r\nand leverets, and geese, and turkeys, and dyucks, and patricks, and wee\r\nbirds, and ither animal eatables, to kill the fox that devoors them, and\r\nkeeps them in perpetual het water?\r\n\r\n_North._ But the fox, James?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ Deevil take baith you and the fox; I said that we would come\r\nto the fox by and by. Weel, then, wha kens that the fox isna away\r\nsnorin' happy afore the houn's? I hae nae doubt he is, for a fox is no\r\nsae complete a coward as to think huntin' cruel; and his haill nature\r\nis then on the alert, which in itsel' is happiness. Huntin' him fa'in\r\ninto languor and ennui, and growin' ower fat on how-towdies (_barn-door\r\nfowls_). He's no killed every time he's hunted.\r\n\r\n_North._ Why, James, you might write for the \"Annals of Sporting.\"\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ So I do sometimes--and mair o' ye than me, I jalouse; but I\r\nwas gaun to ask ye if ye could imagine the delicht o' a fox gettin' into\r\nan undiggable earth, just when the leadin' houn' was at his\r\nhainches?--ae sic moment is aneuch to repay half an hour's draggle\r\nthrough the dirt; and he can lick himsel' clean at his leisure, far ben\r\nin the cranny o' the rock, and come out a' tosh and tidy by the first\r\ndawn o' licht, to snuff the mornin' air, and visit the distant\r\nfarm-house before Partlet has left her perch, or Count Crow lifted his\r\nhead from beneath his oxter on his shed-seraglio.\r\n\r\n_North._ Was ye ever in at a death? Is not that cruel?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ Do you mean in at the death o' ae fox, or the death o' a\r\nhundred thousand men and sixty thousand horses?--the takin' o' a Brush,\r\nor a Borodino?\r\n\r\n_North._ My dear James, thank ye for your argument. As one Chalmers is\r\nworth a thousand Martins, so is one Hogg worth a thousand Chalmerses.\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ Ane may weel lose patience, to think o' fules being sorry\r\nfor the death o' a fox. When the jowlers tear him to pieces, he shows\r\nfecht, and gangs aff in a snarl. Hoo could he dee mair easier?--and for\r\na' the gude he has ever dune, or was likely to do, he surely had leeved\r\nlang eneuch.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCTIC FOX (_Vulpes lagopus_).\r\n\r\nThis inoffensive and pretty little creature is found in all parts of the\r\nArctic lands. Its fur is peculiarly fine and thick; and as in winter\r\nthis is closer and more mixed with wool than it is in summer, the\r\nintense cold of these regions is easily resisted. When sleeping rolled\r\nup into a ball, with the black muzzle buried in the long hairs of the\r\ntail, there is not a portion of the body but what is protected from the\r\ncold, the shaggy hairs of the brush acting as a respirator or boa for\r\nthe mouth and a muff for the paws. Our Arctic travellers have remarked,\r\nthat it is a peculiarly cleanly animal, and its vigilance is extreme. It\r\nis almost impossible to come on it unawares, for even when appearing to\r\nbe soundly asleep, it opens its eyes on the slightest noise being made.\r\nDuring the day it appears to be listless, but no sooner has the night\r\nset in than it is in motion, and it continues very active until morning.\r\nThe young migrate to the southward in the autumn, and sometimes collect\r\nin great numbers on the shores of Hudson's Bay. Mr Graham noticed that\r\nthey came there in November and left in April.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arctic Fox. (Canis Lagopus.)]\r\n\r\nSir James Ross found a fox's burrow on the sandy margin of a lake in the\r\nmonth of July. It had several passages, each opening into a common cell,\r\nbeyond which was an inner nest, in which the young, six in number, were\r\nfound. These had the dusky, lead-coloured livery worn by the parents in\r\nsummer; and though four of them were kept alive till the following\r\nwinter, they never acquired the pure white coats of the old fox, but\r\nretained the dusky colour on the face and sides of the body. The parents\r\nhad kept a good larder for their progeny, as the outer cell and the\r\nseveral passages leading to it contained many lemmings and ermines, and\r\nthe bones of fish, ducks, and hares, in great quantities. Sir John\r\nRichardson[115] observed them to live in villages, twenty or thirty\r\nburrows being constructed close to each other. A pair were kept by Sir\r\nJames Ross for the express purpose of watching the changes which take\r\nplace in the colour of their fur. He noticed that they threw off their\r\nwinter dress during the first week in June, and that this change took\r\nplace a few days earlier in the female than in the male. About the end\r\nof September the brown fur of the summer gradually became of an ash\r\ncolour, and by the middle of October it was perfectly white. It\r\ncontinued to increase in thickness until the end of November.[116] A\r\nvariety of a blackish-brown colour is occasionally met with, but this is\r\nrare: such specimens, Ross remarks, must have extreme difficulty in\r\nsurprising their prey in a country whose surface is of an unvaried\r\nwhite, and must also be much more exposed to the persecutions of their\r\nenemies. The food of this fox is various, but seems to consist\r\nprincipally of lemmings and of birds and their eggs. He eats, too, the\r\nberries of the _Empetrum nigrum_, a plant common on our own hills, and\r\ngoes to the shore for mussels and other shell-fish. Otho Fabricius[117]\r\nsays he catches the Arctic salmon as that fish approaches the shore to\r\nspawn, and that he seizes too the haddock, having enticed it near by\r\nbeating the water. Crantz, in his \"History of Greenland,\" evidently\r\nalludes to this cunning habit when he observes, \"They plash with their\r\nfeet in the water, to excite the curiosity of some kinds of fishes to\r\ncome and see what is going forward, and then they snap them up; and _the\r\nGreenland women have learnt this piece of art from them_.\" Captain Lyon\r\nnoticed a fox prowling on a hill-side, and heard him for some hours\r\nafterwards in the neighbourhood imitating the cry of the brent-goose. In\r\nanother part of his Journal he mentions that the bark is so modulated as\r\nto give an idea that it proceeds from a distance, though at the time the\r\nfox lies at your feet. It struck him that the creature was gifted \"with\r\nthis kind of ventriloquism in order to deceive its prey as to the\r\ndistance it is from them.\" It sometimes catches the ptarmigan; and\r\nthough it cannot swim, it manages occasionally to get hold of oceanic\r\nbirds; in fact, nothing alive which it can master seems to come amiss,\r\nand failing to make a meal from something it has caught and killed, the\r\nArctic fox is glad, like foxes in more favoured lands, to feed on\r\ncarrion.\r\n\r\nCaptain M'Clintock, who commanded the yacht _Fox_ on the Franklin Arctic\r\nsearch in 1857 and 1858, wintered in the ice pack of Baffin's Bay. One\r\nof the party shot an Arctic fox when they were 140 miles from the land.\r\nHe records in a letter to his brother,[118] that this wanderer from the\r\nshore \"was very fat, living upon such few dovekies as were silly enough\r\nto spend their winter in the pack.\"\r\n\r\nMartens, in his \"Spitzbergen,\" says, that some of the ship's crew\r\ninformed him, that the fox when he is hungry \"lies down as if he was\r\ndead, until the birds fly to him to eat him, which by that trick he\r\ncatches and eats.\" Our author believed it a fable, but it may\r\nnevertheless be one of the many expedients used by a species of a group\r\nwhose name is proverbial for craftiness and cunning.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the fox is occasionally eaten by the Esquimaux: Captain\r\nLyon, in his \"Private Journal,\" says that at first all of his party were\r\nhorrified at the idea of eating foxes--\"But very many soon got the\r\nbetter of their fastidiousness and found them good eating; not being\r\nmyself very nice, I soon made the experiment, and found the flesh much\r\nresembling that of kid, and afterwards frequently had a supper of it.\"\r\n\r\nSir James Clarke Ross, during his five years' imprisonment in Boothia\r\nFelix and the adjoining seas, had ample means of judging of its flavour;\r\nhe tells us that some of his party, who were the first to taste them,\r\nnamed them \"lambs,\" from their resemblance in flavour to very young\r\nlamb. He adds, that the flesh of the old fox is by no means so\r\npalatable. During that disastrous expedition the flesh of this fox\r\nformed one of the principal luxuries of their table, and it was always\r\n\"reserved for holidays and great occasions. We ate them boiled, or, more\r\nfrequently after being parboiled, _roasted_, in a pitch kettle.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Arctic Expedition in search of Franklin wintered in Leopold\r\nHarbour in 1848-49, the commander, Sir J. C. Ross, made use of the\r\nArctic fox as a messenger. Having caught some of these animals in traps,\r\na collar with information for the missing parties was put round the neck\r\nof each before liberation, as the fox is known to travel great distances\r\nin search of food. On Captain Austin's subsequent expedition in 1850-51\r\nthe same plan was carried out, but it was found to be equally without\r\nresult. Commander Osborn thus facetiously describes the\r\ncircumstance.[119] \"Several animals thus intrusted with despatches or\r\nrecords were liberated by different ships; but, as the truth must be\r\ntold, I fear in many cases the next night saw the poor 'postman,' as\r\nJack termed him, in another trap, out of which he would be taken,\r\nkilled, the skin taken off, and packed away to ornament at some future\r\nday the neck of some fair Dulcinea. As a 'sub,' I was admitted into this\r\nsecret mystery, or, otherwise, I with others might have accounted for\r\nthe disappearance of the collared foxes by believing them busy on their\r\nhonourable mission. In order that the crime of killing 'the postmen' may\r\nbe recognised in its true light, it is but fair that I should say, that\r\nthe brutes, having partaken once of the good cheer on board or around\r\nthe ships, seldom seemed satisfied with the mere empty honours of a\r\ncopper collar, and returned to be caught over and over again. Strict\r\nlaws were laid down for their safety, such as that no fox taken alive in\r\na trap was to be killed: of course no fox was after this taken alive;\r\nthey were all unaccountably dead, unless it was some fortunate wight\r\nwhose brush and coat were worthless; in such case he lived either to\r\ndrag about a quantity of information in a copper collar for the rest of\r\nhis days, or else to die a slow death, as being intended for Lord\r\nDerby's menagerie. The departure of 'a postman' was a scene of no small\r\nmerriment; all hands, from the captain to the cook, were out to chase\r\nthe fox, who, half frightened out of its wits, seemed to doubt which way\r\nto run, whilst loud shouts and roars of laughter, breaking the cold,\r\nfrosty air, were heard from ship to ship, as the foxhunters, swelled in\r\nnumbers from all sides, and those that could not run mounted some\r\nneighbouring hummock of ice and gave a loud halloo, which said far more\r\nfor robust health than for tuneful melody.\"\r\n\r\nThe Arctic fox as a captive has often amused our Arctic voyagers, and\r\naccounts of it are to be met with in most of their narratives. Captain\r\nLyon made a pet of one he captured, and confined it on deck in a small\r\nkennel with a piece of chain. The little creature astonished the party\r\nvery much by his extraordinary sagacity, for, on the very first day,\r\nhaving been repeatedly drawn out by his chain, he at length drew his\r\nchain in after him whenever he retreated to his hut, and took it in with\r\nhis mouth so completely, that no one who valued his fingers would\r\nventure afterwards to take hold of the end attached to the staple.\r\n\r\nSir J. C. Ross observed in Boothia Felix a good deal of difference in\r\nthe disposition of specimens, some being easily tamed, whilst others\r\nwould remain savage and untractable even with the kindest treatment. He\r\nfound the females much more vicious than the males. A dog-fox which his\r\nparty captured lived several months with them, and became so tame in a\r\nshort time that he regularly attended the dinner-table like a dog, and\r\nwas always allowed to go at large about the cabin. When newly caught\r\ntheir rage is quite ungovernable, and yet when two are put together they\r\nvery seldom quarrel. They soon get reconciled to confinement. Captain\r\nLyon[120] notices that their first impulse on getting food is to hide it\r\nas soon as possible, and this, he observed, they did, even when hungry\r\nand by themselves; when there was snow on the ground they piled it over\r\ntheir stores, and pressed it down forcibly with their nose. When no\r\nsnow was to be obtained, he noticed his pet fox gather the chain into\r\nhis mouth, and then carefully coil it so as to cover the meat. Having\r\ngone through this process, and drawn away his chain after him on moving\r\naway, he has sometimes repeated his useless labours five or six times,\r\nuntil disgusted, apparently, at the inability of making the morsel a\r\ngreater luxury by previous concealment, he has been forced to eat it.\r\nThese creatures use snow as a substitute for water, and it is pleasing\r\nto see them break a large lump with their feet, and roll on the pieces\r\nwith evident delight. When the snow lay lightly scattered on the decks,\r\nthey did not lick it up as dogs do, but by pressing it repeatedly with\r\ntheir nose, collected a small lump which they drew into their mouth.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the specific name _lagopus_, or \"hare-foot,\" was\r\ngiven to this fox from the soles of its feet being densely covered with\r\nwoolly hair, which gives them some resemblance to the feet of a hare.\r\nCuvier remarks that other foxes acquire this hair on the soles when\r\ntaken to northern lands.\r\n\r\nThe specimens, figured so admirably by Mr Wolf, were drawn from some\r\nbrought alive to the Zoological Gardens by one of the late Arctic\r\nexpeditions.--_A.

He is a\r\nmean, starved-looking creature in ordinary circumstances, seeming as if\r\nhis social life prevented his getting what is called _a lion's_ share on\r\nany occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACKAL AND TIGER.\r\n\r\nAs Burke was declaiming with great animation against Hastings, he was\r\ninterrupted by little Major Scott. \"Am I,\" said he, indignantly, \"to be\r\nteased by the barking of this _jackal_, while I am attacking the royal\r\n_tiger_ of Bengal?\"[121]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother fertile subject for anecdote. Who has not some faithful black\r\nTopsy, Tortoise-shell, or Tabby, or rather succession of them, whose\r\nbiographies would afford many a curious story? Professor Bell[122] has\r\nwell defended the general character of poor pussy from the oft-repeated\r\ncalumnies spread about it. Cats certainly get much attached to\r\nindividuals, as well as to houses and articles in them. They want the\r\nlovableness and demonstrativeness of dogs; but their habits are very\r\ndifferent, and they are strictly organised to adapt them to watch and to\r\npounce on their prey.\r\n\r\nAs we have elsewhere remarked, and the remark was founded on observation\r\nof our eldest daughter when a very young child, \"Your little baby loves\r\nthe pussy, and pussy sheathes her claws most carefully, but should baby\r\ndraw back her arm suddenly, and pussy accidentally scratch that tender\r\nskin, how the little girl cries! It is, perhaps, her first lesson that\r\nsweets and bitters, pleasures and pains, meekness and ferocity, are\r\nmingled in this world.\"[123]\r\n\r\n\r\nJEREMY BENTHAM AND HIS PET CAT \"SIR JOHN LANGBORN.\"\r\n\r\nDr, afterwards Sir John, Bowring, in the life of that diligent eccentric\r\n\"codificator,\" Jeremy Bentham,[124] thus alludes to some of his\r\npets:--\"Bentham was very fond of animals, particularly '_pussies_,' as\r\nhe called them, 'when they had domestic virtues;' but he had no\r\nparticular affection for the common race of _cats_. He had one, however,\r\nof which he used to boast that he had 'made a man of him,' and whom he\r\nwas wont to invite to eat maccaroni at his own table. This puss got\r\nknighted, and rejoiced in the name of Sir John Langborn. In his early\r\ndays, he was a frisky, inconsiderate, and, to say the truth, somewhat\r\nprofligate gentleman; and had, according to the report of his patron,\r\nthe habit of seducing light and giddy young ladies of his own race into\r\nthe garden of Queen's Square Place; but tired at last, like Solomon, of\r\npleasures and vanities, he became sedate and thoughtful--took to the\r\nchurch, laid down his knightly title, and was installed as the Reverend\r\nJohn Langborn. He gradually obtained a great reputation for sanctity and\r\nlearning, and a doctor's degree was conferred upon him. When I knew him,\r\nin his declining days, he bore no other name than the Reverend Doctor\r\nJohn Langborn; and he was alike conspicuous for his gravity and\r\nphilosophy. Great respect was invariably shown his reverence; and it was\r\nsupposed he was not far off from a mitre, when old age interfered with\r\nhis hopes and honours. He departed amidst the regrets of his many\r\nfriends, and was gathered to his fathers, and to eternal rest, in a\r\ncemetery in Milton's Garden.[125]\r\n\r\n\"'I had a cat,' he said, 'at Hendon, which used to follow me about even\r\nin the street. George Wilson was very fond of animals too. I remember a\r\ncat following him as far as Staines. There was a beautiful pig at\r\nHendon, which I used to rub with my stick. He loved to come and lie down\r\nto be rubbed, and took to following me like a dog. I had a remarkably\r\nintellectual cat, who never failed to attend one of us when we went\r\nround the garden. He grew quite a tyrant, insisting on being fed and on\r\nbeing noticed. He interrupted my labours. Once he came with a most\r\nhideous yell, insisting on the door being opened. He tormented Jack\r\n(Colls) so much, that Jack threw him out of the window. He was so\r\nclamorous that it could not be borne, and means were found to send him\r\nto another world. His moral qualities were most despotic--his\r\nintellectual extraordinary; but he was a universal nuisance.\"\r\n\r\n\"'From my youth I was fond of cats, as I am still. I was once playing\r\nwith one in my grandmother's room. I had heard the story of cats having\r\nnine lives, and being sure of falling on their legs; and I threw the cat\r\nout of the window on the grass-plot. When it fell it turned towards me,\r\nlooked in my face and mewed. \"Poor thing!\" I said, \"thou art reproaching\r\nme with my unkindness.\" I have a distinct recollection of all these\r\nthings. Cowper's story of his hares had the highest interest for me when\r\nyoung; for I always enjoyed the society of tame animals. Wilson had the\r\nsame taste--so had Romilly, who kept a noble puss, before he came into\r\ngreat business. I never failed to pay it my respects. I remember\r\naccusing Romilly of violating the commandment in the matter of cats. My\r\nfondness for animals exposed me to many jokes.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBISSET AND HIS MUSICAL CATS.\r\n\r\nS. Bisset, to whom we referred before, was a Scotchman, born at Perth.\r\nHe went to London as a shoemaker; but afterwards turned a broker. About\r\n1739 he turned his attention to the teaching of animals. He was very\r\nsuccessful, and among the subjects of his experiments were three young\r\ncats. Wilson, in his \"Eccentric Mirror,\"[126] has recorded that \"he\r\ntaught these domestic tigers to strike their paws in such directions on\r\nthe dulcimer, as to produce several tunes, having music-books before\r\nthem, and squalling at the same time in different keys or tones, first,\r\nsecond, and third, by way of concert. In such a city as London these\r\nfeats could not fail of making some noise. His house was every day\r\ncrowded, and great interruption given to his business. Among the rest,\r\nhe was visited by an exhibitor of wonders. Pinchbeck advised him to a\r\npublic exhibition of his animals at the Haymarket, and even promised, on\r\nreceiving a moiety, to be concerned in the exhibition. Bisset agreed,\r\nbut the day before the performance, Pinchbeck declined, and the other\r\nwas left to act for himself. The well-known _Cats' Opera_ was advertised\r\nin the Haymarket; the horse, the dog, the monkeys, and the cats went\r\nthrough their several parts with uncommon applause, to crowded houses,\r\nand in a few days Bisset found himself possessed of nearly a thousand\r\npounds to reward his ingenuity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTANT, CHATEAUBRIAND, AND THE CAT.\r\n\r\n\"Benjamin Constant was accustomed to write in a closet on the third\r\nstory. Beside him sat his estimable wife, and on his knee his favourite\r\ncat; this feline affection he entertained in common with Count de\r\nChateaubriand.\"[127]\r\n\r\n\r\nLISTON THE SURGEON AND HIS CAT.\r\n\r\nRobert Liston, the great surgeon, was, it seems, very fond of a cat. Dr\r\nForbes Winslow asks, \"Who has not seen Liston's favourite cat Tom? This\r\nanimal is considered to be a unique specimen of the feline tribe; and so\r\none would think, to see the passionate fondness which he manifests for\r\nit. This cat is always perched on Liston's shoulder, at breakfast,\r\ndinner, and tea, in his carriage, and out of his carriage. It is quite\r\nludicrous to witness the devotion which the great operator exhibits\r\ntowards his favourite.\"[128]\r\n\r\nListon was a curious man. He often called on his friends as early as six\r\no'clock in the morning. In most cases, such calls must have been visits\r\nof formality or quiet jokes at the lazy manners of most men of the\r\npresent age. We know one person whom he called on usually at this early\r\nhour. It would be more healthy for the young, if they would imitate this\r\ntalented surgeon. We may here say that he used to allow one particular\r\nnail to grow long. It was a nail he used to guide his knife when\r\noperating. When at college in 1833 or 1834, we heard a student, who knew\r\nthis clever operator well, happily apply the _double-entendre_, \"_homo\r\nad unguem factus_,\" a phrase, Dr Carson, our noble rector at the High\r\nSchool, taught us to translate \"_an accomplished man_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANKER MITCHELL'S ANTIPATHY TO KITTENS.\r\n\r\nMr J. T. Smith, once Keeper of the Prints in the British Museum, author\r\nof the \"Life and Times of Nollekens, the Royal Academician,\"[129] tells\r\na story of Mr Matthew Mitchell, a banker, who collected prints.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Mitchell had a most serious antipathy to a kitten. He could sit in a\r\nroom without experiencing the least emotion from a cat; but directly he\r\nperceived a kitten, his flesh shook on his bones, like a snail in\r\nvinegar. I once relieved him from one of these paroxysms by taking a\r\nkitten out of the room; on my return he thanked me, and declared his\r\nfeelings to be insupportable upon such an occasion. Long subsequently, I\r\nasked him whether he could in any way account for this agitation. He\r\nsaid he could not, adding that he experienced no such sensations upon\r\nseeing a full-grown cat; but that a kitten, after he had looked at it\r\nfor a minute or two, in his imagination grew to the size of an\r\noverpowering elephant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MONTGOMERY AND HIS CATS.[130]\r\n\r\nThe poet Montgomery was very fond of cats. His biographers say--\"We\r\nnever recollect the time when some familiar 'Tabby' or audacious 'Tom'\r\ndid not claim to share the poet's attention during our familiar\r\ninterviews with him in his own parlour. We well recollect one fine\r\nbrindled fellow, called 'Nero,' who, during his kittenhood, 'purred' the\r\nfollowing epistle to a little girl who had been his playmate:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                \"HARTSHEAD, NEAR THE HOLE-IN-THE-WALL,\r\n                                                     \"_July 23, 1825_.\r\n   \"_Harrrrrrr_,\r\n\r\n    \"_Mew, wew, auw, mauw, hee, wee, miaw, waw, wurr, whirr, ghurr, wew,\r\n    mew, whew, isssss, tz, tz, tz, purrurrurrur._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDONE INTO ENGLISH.\r\n\r\n\"HARRIET,\r\n\r\n\"This comes to tell you that I am very well, and I hope you are so too.\r\nI am growing a great cat; pray how do you come on?

In the\r\nyear 1797, Walter Scott, then a young advocate, was taken by the\r\nFergusons to see \"Bowed Davie,\" as the poor misanthropic man was\r\ngenerally called.\r\n\r\nMr William Chambers,[131] the historian of his native county, describes\r\nthe visit at greater length than Scott has done in the introduction to\r\nhis novel. He says--\"At the first sight of Scott, the misanthrope seemed\r\noppressed with a sentiment of extraordinary interest, which was either\r\nowing to the lameness of the stranger--a circumstance throwing a\r\nnarrower gulf between this person and himself than what existed between\r\nhim and most other men--or to some perception of an extraordinary mental\r\ncharacter in this limping youth, which was then hid from other eyes.\r\nAfter grinning upon him for a moment with a smile less bitter than his\r\nwont, the dwarf passed to the door, double-locked it, and then coming up\r\nto the stranger, seized him by the wrist with one of his iron hands, and\r\nsaid, 'Man, hae ye ony poo'er?' By this he meant magical power, to which\r\nhe had himself some vague pretensions, or which, at least, he had\r\nstudied and reflected upon till it had become with him a kind of\r\nmonomania. Scott disavowed the possession of any gifts of that kind,\r\nevidently to the great disappointment of the inquirer, who then turned\r\nround and gave a signal to a huge black cat, hitherto unobserved, which\r\nimmediately jumped up to a shelf, where it perched itself, and seemed to\r\nthe excited senses of the visitors as if it had really been the familiar\r\nspirit of the mansion. 'He has poo'er,' said the dwarf in a voice which\r\nmade the flesh of the hearers thrill, and Scott, in particular, looked\r\nas if he conceived himself to have actually got into the den of one of\r\nthose magicians with whom his studies had rendered him familiar. 'Ay,\r\n_he_ has poo'er,' repeated the recluse; and then, going to his usual\r\nseat, he sat for some minutes grinning horribly, as if enjoying the\r\nimpression he had made, while not a word escaped from any of the party.\r\nMr Ferguson at length plucked up his spirits, and called to David to\r\nopen the door, as they must now be going. The dwarf slowly obeyed, and\r\nwhen they had got out, Mr Ferguson observed that his friend was as pale\r\nas ashes, while his person was agitated in every limb. Under such\r\nstriking circumstances was this extraordinary being first presented to\r\nthe _real_ magician, who was afterwards to give him such a deathless\r\ncelebrity.\"\r\n\r\nMr Chambers doubtless received the particulars of this visit from Sir\r\nAdam Ferguson, Scott's friend and companion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRobert Southey, like Jeremy Bentham, with whom the Quarterly Reviewer\r\nwould have grudged to have been classified, loved cats. His son, in his\r\n\"Life and Correspondence,\" vol. vi. p. 210, says--\"My father's fondness\r\nfor cats has been occasionally shown by allusion in his letters,[132]\r\nand in 'The Doctor' is inserted an amusing memorial of the various cats\r\nwhich at different times were inmates of Greta Hall. He rejoiced in\r\nbestowing upon them the strangest appellations, and it was not a little\r\namusing to see a kitten answer to the name of some Italian singer or\r\nIndian chief, or hero of a German fairy tale, and often names and titles\r\nwere heaped one upon another, till the possessor, unconscious of the\r\nhonour conveyed, used to 'set up his eyes and look' in wonderment. Mr\r\nBedford had an equal liking for the feline race, and occasional notices\r\nof their favourites therefore passed between them, of which the\r\nfollowing records the death of one of the greatest:--\r\n\r\n                                     \"'_To Grosvenor C. Bedford, Esq._\r\n                                            \"'KESWICK, _May 18, 1833_.\r\n\r\n\"'My Dear G---- ... --Alas! Grosvenor, this day poor old Rumpel was found\r\ndead, after as long and happy a life as cat could wish for, if cats form\r\nwishes on that subject.

The Dutch cats do not\r\nspeak exactly the same language as the English ones. I will tell you how\r\nthey talk when I come home.\"[134]\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOP WHATELY'S ANECDOTE OF THE CAT THAT USED TO RING THE BELL.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Whately[135] records a case of an act done by a cat, which,\r\nif done by a man, would be called reason. He says--\"This cat lived many\r\nyears in my mother's family, and its feats of sagacity were witnessed by\r\nher, my sisters, and myself. It was known, not merely once or twice, but\r\nhabitually, to ring the parlour bell whenever it wished the door to be\r\nopened. Some alarm was excited on the first occasion that it turned\r\nbell-ringer. The family had retired to rest, and in the middle of the\r\nnight the parlour-bell was rung violently; the sleepers were startled\r\nfrom their repose, and proceeded down-stairs, with pokers and tongs, to\r\ninterrupt, as they thought, the predatory movement of some burglar; but\r\nthey were agreeably surprised to discover that the bell had been rung by\r\npussy; who frequently repeated the act whenever she wanted to get out of\r\nthe parlour.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA friend (D. D., Esq., Edinburgh) tells me of a cat his family had in\r\nthe country, that used regularly to \"_tirl at the pin_\" of the back door\r\nwhen it wished to get in to the house.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[121] Mark Lemon, \"Jest-Book,\" p. 280.\r\n\r\n[122] \"British Quadrupeds.\" The professor has long retired to his\r\nfavourite Selborne.

An extensive volume of truly sensational adventure\r\nmight be compiled about them, adding a chapter for the jaguar and the\r\nleopard, two extremely dangerous spotted cats, that can do what neither\r\ntigers nor lions are able to do--namely, climb trees. Having once asked\r\na friend, who was at the death of many a wild beast, which was the most\r\nsavage animal he had ever seen, he replied, \"A wounded leopard.\" It was\r\nto such an animal that Jacob referred when he saw Joseph's clothes, and\r\nsaid--\"Some evil beast hath devoured him.\" Colonel Campbell's work, from\r\nwhich the first paragraph is derived, contains much about the pursuit of\r\nthe tiger. Dr Livingstone's travels and Gordon Cumming's books on South\r\nAfrica, neither of which we have quoted, have thrilling pages about the\r\nlordly presence of \"the king of beasts.\" Mr Joseph Wolf and Mr Lewis are\r\nperhaps the best draughtsmen of the lion among recent artists. The\r\npublic admire much Sir Edwin Landseer's striking bronze lions on the\r\npedestal of the Nelson Monument. That artist excels in his pictures of\r\nthe lion. On the Assyrian monuments in the British Museum are many\r\nwonderfully executed lion hunts, as perfectly preserved as if they had\r\nbeen chiselled in our day. Parts of these bas-reliefs were certainly\r\ndesigned from actual sketches made from the lions and dogs, which took\r\nthe chief part in the amusements of some \"Nimrod, a mighty hunter before\r\nthe Lord.\" Even our Scottish kings kept a lion or lions as ornaments of\r\ntheir court. At Stirling Castle and Palace, a room which we saw in 1865,\r\nstill bears the name of the \"Lion's Den.\" The British lion is an old\r\nemblem of both Scotland and England, and it is not twenty-five years ago\r\nsince we, in common with every visitor to the Tower, were glad to see\r\n\"the Royal Lion.\" Dr Livingstone's experience, we have not the slightest\r\nwish to prove its accuracy, shows that the lion has a soothing, or\r\nrather paralysing power over his prey, when he has knocked it down or\r\nbitten it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSSAPA, THE TIGER-SLAYER, AND THE TIGER.\r\n\r\nThe following striking anecdote recounts the extraordinary presence of\r\nmind and determined courage of a celebrated Mahratta hunter named\r\nBussapa. This man acquired the name of the \"Tiger-slayer,\" and wore on\r\nhis breast several silver medals granted by the Indian Government for\r\nfeats of courage in destroying tigers. Colonel Campbell met him, and in\r\n\"My Indian Journal\" (pp. 142, 143), published in 1864, has recorded from\r\nhis brother's diary the following anecdote:--\"Bussapa, a hunter of\r\n'Lingyat' caste, with whom I am well acquainted, was sent for by the\r\nheadman of a village, to destroy a tiger which had carried off a number\r\nof cattle. He came, and having ascertained the brute's usual haunts,\r\nfastened a bullock near the edge of a ravine which he frequented, and\r\nquietly seated himself beside it, protected only by a small bush. Soon\r\nafter sunset the tiger appeared, killed the bullock, and was glutting\r\nhimself with blood, when Bussapa, thrusting his long matchlock through\r\nthe bush, fired, and wounded him severely. The tiger half rose, but\r\nbeing unable to see his assailant on account of the intervening bush,\r\ndropped again on his prey with a sudden growl. Bussapa was kneeling\r\nwithin three paces of him, completely defenceless; he did not even dare\r\nto reload, for he well knew that the slightest movement on his part\r\nwould be the signal for his immediate destruction; his bare knees were\r\npressed upon gravel, but he dared not venture to shift his uneasy\r\nposition. Ever and anon, the tiger, as he lay with his glaring eyes\r\nfixed upon the bush, uttered his hoarse growl of anger; his hot breath\r\nabsolutely blew upon the cheek of the wretched man, yet still he moved\r\nnot. The pain of his cramped position increased every moment--suspense\r\nbecame almost intolerable; but the motion of a limb, the rustling of a\r\nleaf, would have been death. Thus they remained, the man and the tiger,\r\nwatching each other's motions; but even in this fearful situation, his\r\npresence of mind never for a moment forsook the noble fellow. He heard\r\nthe gong of the village strike each hour of that fearful night, that\r\nseemed to him 'eternity,' and yet he lived; the tormenting mosquitoes\r\nswarmed round his face, but he dared not brush them off. That fiend-like\r\neye met his whenever he ventured a glance towards the horrid spell that\r\nbound him; and a hoarse growl grated on the stillness of the night, as a\r\npassing breeze stirred the leaves that sheltered him. Hours rolled on,\r\nand his powers of endurance were well-nigh exhausted, when, at length,\r\nthe welcome streaks of light shot up from the eastern horizon. On the\r\napproach of day, the tiger rose, and stalked away with a sulky pace, to\r\na thicket at some distance, and then the stiff and wearied Bussapa felt\r\nthat he was safe.\r\n\r\n\"One would have thought that, after such a night of suffering, he would\r\nhave been too thankful for his escape, to venture on any further risk.\r\nBut the valiant Bussapa was not so easily diverted from his purpose; as\r\nsoon as he had stretched his cramped limbs, and restored the checked\r\ncirculation, he reloaded his matchlock, and coolly proceeded to finish\r\nhis work. With his match lighted, he advanced close to the tiger, lying\r\nready to receive him, and shot him dead by a ball in the forehead, while\r\nin the act of charging.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Campbell relates, that most of Bussapa's family have fallen\r\nvictims to tigers. But the firm belief of the \"tiger-slayer\" in\r\npredestination, makes him blind to all danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN HUNTER AND THE DEAD TIGER.\r\n\r\nThe greatest comparative anatomist our country has produced, John\r\nHunter, obtained the refusal of all animals which happened to die in the\r\nTower or in the travelling menageries. In this way he often obtained\r\nrare subjects for his researches. Dr Forbes Winslow[136] alludes to a\r\nwell-known fact, that all the money Hunter could spare, was devoted to\r\nprocuring curiosities of this sort, and Sir Everard Home used to state,\r\nthat as soon as he had accumulated fees to the amount of ten guineas, he\r\nalways purchased some addition to his collection. Indeed, he was not\r\nunfrequently obliged to borrow of his friends, when his own funds were\r\nat a low ebb, and the temptation was strong. \"Pray, George,\" said he one\r\nday to Mr G. Nicol, the bookseller to the king, with whom he was very\r\nintimate, \"have you got any money in your pocket?\" Mr N. replied in the\r\naffirmative. \"Have you got five guineas? Because, if you have, and will\r\nlend it me, you shall go halves.\"--\"Halves in what?\" inquired his\r\nfriend.--\"Why, halves in a magnificent tiger, which is now dying in\r\nCastle Street.\" Mr Nicol lent the money, and Hunter purchased the tiger.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIGERS.\r\n\r\nMrs Colin Mackenzie[137] records the death of a man from the wounds of a\r\ntiger. \"The tiger,\" she says, \"was brought in on the second day. He died\r\nfrom the wound he had received. I gave the body to the Dhers in our\r\nservice, who ate it. The claws and whiskers are greatly prized by the\r\nnatives as charms. The latter are supposed to give the possessor a\r\ncertain malignant power over his enemies, for which reason I always\r\ntake possession of them to prevent our people getting them. The tiger is\r\nvery commonly worshipped all over India. The women often prostrate\r\nthemselves before a dead tiger, when sportsmen are bringing it home in\r\ntriumph; and in a village, near Nagpur, Mr Hislop found a number of rude\r\nimages, almost like four-legged stools, which, on inquiry, proved to be\r\nmeant for tigers, who were worshipped as the tutelary deities of the\r\nplace. I believe a fresh image is added for every tiger that is slain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLION AND TIGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA jolly jack-tar, having strayed into Atkin's show at Bartholomew Fair,\r\nto have a look at the wild beasts, was much struck with the sight of a\r\nlion and a tiger in the same den. \"Why, Jack,\" said he to a messmate,\r\nwho was chewing a quid in silent amazement, \"I shouldn't wonder if next\r\nyear they were to carry about _a sailor and a marine living peaceably\r\ntogether_!\"--\"Ay,\" said his married companion, \"_or a man and\r\nwife_.\"[138]\r\n\r\nWe may add that we have long regarded it as a vile calumny to two\r\nanimals to say of a man and wife who quarrel, that they live \"a cat and\r\ndog life.\" No two animals are better agreed when kept together. Each\r\nknows his own place and keeps it. Hence they live at peace--speaking\r\n\"generally,\" as \"Mr Artemus Ward\" would say of \"such an observation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nANDROCLES AND THE LION.\r\n\r\nAddison,[139] in the 139th _Guardian_, has given us the story of\r\nAndrocles and the Lion. He prefaces it by saying that he has no regard\r\n\"to what Æsop has said upon the subject, whom,\" says he, \"I look upon to\r\nhave been a republican, by the unworthy treatment which he often gives\r\nto the king of beasts, and whom, if I had time, I could convict of\r\nfalsehood and forgery in almost every matter of fact which he has\r\nrelated of this generous animal.\"\r\n\r\nBetter observation of it, however, from the time of Burchell to that of\r\nLivingstone, shows that Æsop's account is on the whole to be relied on,\r\nand that the lion is a thorough cat, treacherous, cruel, and, for the\r\nmost part, with a good deal of the coward in him.\r\n\r\nThe story of Androcles was related by Aulus Gellius, who extracted it\r\nfrom Dion Cassius. Although likely to be embellished, there is every\r\nlikelihood of the foundation of the story being true. Addison relates\r\nthis, \"for the sake of my learned reader, who needs go no further in it,\r\nif he has read it already:--Androcles was the slave of a noble Roman who\r\nwas proconsul of Afric. He had been guilty of a fault, for which his\r\nmaster would have put him to death, had not he found an opportunity to\r\nescape out of his hands, and fled into the deserts of Numidia. As he was\r\nwandering among the barren sands, and almost dead with heat and hunger,\r\nhe saw a cave in the side of a rock. He went into it, and finding at the\r\nfarther end of it a place to sit down upon, rested there for some time.\r\nAt length, to his great surprise, a huge overgrown lion entered at the\r\nmouth of the cave, and seeing a man at the upper end of it, immediately\r\nmade towards him. Androcles gave himself up for gone;[140] but the lion,\r\ninstead of treating him as he expected, laid his paw upon his lap, and\r\nwith a complaining kind of voice, fell a licking his hand. Androcles,\r\nafter having recovered himself a little from the fright he was in,\r\nobserved the lion's paw to be exceedingly swelled by a large thorn that\r\nstuck in it. He immediately pulled it out, and by squeezing the paw very\r\ngently made a great deal of corrupt matter run out of it, which,\r\nprobably freed the lion from the great anguish he had felt some time\r\nbefore. The lion left him upon receiving this good office from him, and\r\nsoon after returned with a fawn which he had just killed. This he laid\r\ndown at the feet of his benefactor, and went off again in pursuit of his\r\nprey. Androcles, after having sodden the flesh of it by the sun,\r\nsubsisted upon it until the lion had supplied him with another. He lived\r\nmany days in this frightful solitude, the lion catering for him with\r\ngreat assiduity. Being tired at length with this savage society, he was\r\nresolved to deliver himself up into his master's hands, and suffer the\r\nworst effects of his displeasure, rather than be thus driven out from\r\nmankind. His master, as was customary for the proconsuls of Africa, was\r\nat that time getting together a present of all the largest lions that\r\ncould be found in the country, in order to send them to Rome, that they\r\nmight furnish out a show to the Roman people. Upon his poor slave\r\nsurrendering himself into his hands, he ordered him to be carried away\r\nto Rome as soon as the lions were in readiness to be sent, and that for\r\nhis crime he should be exposed to fight with one of the lions in the\r\namphitheatre, as usual, for the diversion of the people. This was all\r\nperformed accordingly. Androcles, after such a strange run of fortune,\r\nwas now in the area of the theatre, amidst thousands of spectators,\r\nexpecting every moment when his antagonist would come out upon him. At\r\nlength a huge monstrous lion leaped out from the place where he had been\r\nkept hungry for the show. He advanced with great rage towards the man,\r\nbut on a sudden, after having regarded him a little wistfully, fell to\r\nthe ground, and crept towards his feet with all the signs of\r\nblandishment and caress. Androcles, after a short pause, discovered that\r\nit was his old Numidian friend, and immediately renewed his acquaintance\r\nwith him. Their mutual congratulations were very surprising to the\r\nbeholders, who, upon hearing an account of the whole matter from\r\nAndrocles, ordered him to be pardoned, and the lion to be given up into\r\nhis possession. Androcles returned at Rome the civilities which he had\r\nreceived from him in the deserts of Afric. Dion Cassius says, that he\r\nhimself saw the man leading the lion about the streets of Rome, the\r\npeople everywhere gathering about them, and repeating to one another,\r\n'_Hic est leo hospes hominis; hic est homo medicus leonis_.' 'This is\r\nthe lion who was the man's host; this is the man who was the lion's\r\nphysician.'\"\r\n\r\nWe are glad to repeat this anecdote, although some may call it \"stale\r\nand old.\" The last time we were at the Zoological Gardens, in the\r\nRegents Park, London, we saw a lion very kindly come and rub itself\r\nagainst the rails of its den, on seeing a turbaned visitor come up, who\r\naddressed it. The man had been kind to it on its passage home. It was\r\nby no means a tame lion, nor one that its keeper would have ventured to\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR GEORGE DAVIS AND THE LION\r\n\r\nSteele, in the 146th _Guardian_,[141] has followed up a paper by\r\nAddison, on the subject of lions, and gives an anecdote sent him, he\r\nsays, by \"a worthy merchant and a friend of mine,\" who had it in the\r\nyear 1700 from the gentleman to whom it happened.\r\n\r\n\"About sixty years ago, when the plague raged at Naples, Sir George\r\nDavis, consul there for the English nation, retired to Florence. It\r\nhappened one day he went out of curiosity to see the great duke's lions.\r\nAt the farther end, in one of the dens, lay a lion, which the keepers in\r\nthree years' time could not tame, with all the art and gentle usage\r\nimaginable. Sir George no sooner appeared at the grates of the den, but\r\nthe lion ran to him with all the marks of joy and transport he was\r\ncapable of expressing. He reared himself up, and licked his hand, which\r\nthis gentleman put in through the grates. The keeper affrighted, took\r\nhim by the arm and pulled him away, begging him not to hazard his life\r\nby going so near the fiercest creature of that kind that ever entered\r\nthose dens. However, nothing would satisfy Sir George, notwithstanding\r\nall that could be said to dissuade him, but he must go into the den to\r\nhim. The very instant he entered, the lion threw his paws upon his\r\nshoulders, and licked his face, and ran to and fro in the den, fawning\r\nand full of joy, like a dog at the sight of his master. After several\r\nembraces and salutations exchanged on both sides, they parted very good\r\nfriends. The rumour of this interview between the lion and the stranger\r\nrung immediately through the whole city, and Sir George was very near\r\npassing for a saint among the people. The great duke, when he heard of\r\nit, sent for Sir George, who waited upon his highness, to the den, and\r\nto satisfy his curiosity, gave him the following account of what seemed\r\nso strange to the duke and his followers:--\r\n\r\n\"'A captain of a ship from Barbary gave me this lion when he was a young\r\nwhelp. I brought him up tame, but when I thought him too large to be\r\nsuffered to run about the house, I built a den for him in my courtyard;\r\nfrom that time he was never permitted to go loose, except when I brought\r\nhim within doors to show him to my friends. When he was five years old,\r\nin his gamesome tricks, he did some mischief by pawing and playing with\r\npeople. Having griped a man one day a little too hard, I ordered him to\r\nbe shot, for fear of incurring the guilt of what might happen; upon this\r\na friend who was then at dinner with me begged him: how he came here I\r\nknow not.'\r\n\r\nHere Sir George Davis ended, and thereupon the Duke of Tuscany assured\r\nhim that he had the lion from that very friend of his.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCANOVA'S LIONS AND THE CHILD.\r\n\r\nThe mausoleum of Pope Clement XII., whose name was Rezzonico, is one of\r\nthe greatest works of Antonio Canova, the celebrated Italian sculptor.\r\nIt is in St Peter's, at Rome, and was erected in 1792. It is only\r\nmentioned here on account of two lions, which were faithfully studied\r\nfrom nature.\r\n\r\nHis biographer, Mr Memes,[142] tells us that these lions were formed\r\n\"after long and repeated observation on the habits and forms of the\r\nliving animals. Wherever they were to be seen Canova constantly visited\r\nthem, at all hours, and under every variety of circumstances, that he\r\nmight mark their natural expression in different states of action and of\r\nrepose, of ferocity or gentleness. One of the keepers was even paid to\r\nbring information, lest any favourable opportunity should pass\r\nunimproved.\"\r\n\r\nOne of these lions is sleeping, while the other, which is under the\r\nfigure of the personification of religion, couches--but is awake, in\r\nattitude of guarding inviolate the approach to the sepulchre, and ready\r\nwith a tremendous roar to spring upon the intruder.\r\n\r\nCanova himself was much pleased with these lions. Mr Memes illustrates\r\ntheir wonderful force and truth by a little anecdote.\r\n\r\n\"One day, while the author (a frequent employment) stood at some\r\ndistance admiring from different points of view the tomb of Rezzonico, a\r\nwoman with a child in her arms advanced to the lion, which appears to be\r\nwatching. The terrified infant began to scream violently, clinging to\r\nthe nurse's bosom, and exclaiming, '_Mordera, mamma, mordera!_' (It will\r\nbite, mamma; it will bite.) The mother turned to the opposite one, which\r\nseems asleep; her charge was instantly pacified; and smiling through\r\ntears, extended its little arm to stroke the shaggy head, whispering in\r\nsubdued accents, as if afraid to awake the monster, '_O come placido!\r\nnon mordero quello, mamma._' (How gentle! this one will not bite,\r\nmother.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRAL NAPIER AND THE LION IN THE TOWER.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Sir Charles Napier, K.C.B., when a boy in his fourteenth year,\r\nvisited London on his way to join his first ship at Spithead, the\r\n_Renown_. His biographer tells us he was staying at the house of a\r\nrelative, who, \"after showing the youngster all the London sights, took\r\nhim to see the lions at the Tower. Amongst them was one which the keeper\r\nrepresented as being so very tame that, said he, 'you might put your\r\nhand into his mouth.' Taking him at his word, the young middy, to the\r\nhorror of the spectators, thrust his hand into the jaws of the animal,\r\nwho, no doubt, was taken as much by surprise as the lookers-on. It was a\r\ndaring feat; but providentially he did not suffer for his\r\ntemerity.\"[143] This reminds the biographer of Nelson's feat with the\r\npolar bear, and of Charles Napier's (the soldier) bold adventure with an\r\neagle in his boyhood, as related by Sir William Napier in the history of\r\nhis gallant brother's life.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD LADY AND THE BEASTS ON THE MOUND.\r\n\r\nWhen the houses were cleared from the head of the Mound in Edinburgh, a\r\ntravelling menagerie had set up its caravans on that great earthen\r\nbridge, just at the time when George Ferguson, the celebrated Scotch\r\nadvocate, better known by his justiciary title of Lord Hermand, came up,\r\nfull of Pittite triumph that the ministry of \"all the talents\" had\r\nfallen. \"They are out! they are all out! every mother's son of them!\" he\r\nshouted. A lady, who heard the words, and perceived his excited\r\ncondition, imagined that he referred to the wild beasts; and seizing the\r\njudge by his arm, exclaimed, \"Gude heaven! we shall a' be\r\ndevoored!\"[144]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136] \"Physics and Physicians: a Medical Sketch-Book,\" vol. i. p. 174.\r\nIt was published anonymously in 1839.\r\n\r\n[137] \"Life in the Mission, the Camp, and the Zenánà; or, Six Years in\r\nIndia,\" vol. ii. p. 382.\r\n\r\n[138] Mark Lemon, \"Jest Book,\" p. 237.\r\n\r\n[139] August 20, 1713.

He has even seen them once or\r\ntwice in the Forth, close to the end of the pier. In the Zoological\r\nGardens a specimen of the common seal proved for months a great source\r\nof attraction by its mild nature, and its singular form and activity. It\r\nsoon died, and, had a coroner's jury returned a verdict, it would have\r\nbeen \"Death from the hooks swallowed with the fish\" daily provided. We\r\nhave heard seal-fishers describe the great rapidity of the growth of\r\nseals in the Arctic seas. They seem in about a fortnight after their\r\nbirth to attain nearly the size of their mothers. The same has been\r\nrecorded of the whale order. Both seals and whales have powers of\r\nassimilating food and making fat that are unparalleled even by pigs. The\r\nintelligence of seals is marvellous. Many who visited the Zoological\r\nGardens in the Regent's Park in May and June 1866 witnessed instances of\r\nthis in a seal from the South Seas, recently exhibited in London.\r\nPersons on the sea-side might readily domesticate these interesting and\r\ntruly affectionate creatures. Hooker's sea-bear, the species exhibited\r\nin London, was at first, so the kind Frenchman told us, very fierce, but\r\nsoon got reconciled to him, and, when I saw it, great was the mutual\r\nattachment. It was a strangely interesting sight to see the great\r\ncreature walk on its fin-like legs, and clamber up and kiss the\r\ngenial-bearded French sailor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR ADAM CLARKE ON SHETLAND SEALS.\r\n\r\nIn Shetland, Dr Adam Clarke tells us the popular belief is that the\r\nseals, or, as they call them, _selkies_, are fallen spirits, and that it\r\nis dangerous to kill any of them, as evil will assuredly happen to him\r\nwho does. They think that when the blood of a seal touches the water,\r\nthe sea begins to rise and swell. Those who shoot them notice that gulls\r\nappear to watch carefully over them; and Mr Edmonston assured him that\r\nhe has known a gull scratch, a seal to warn it of his approach. Dr\r\nClarke, in the second of his voyages to Shetland, had a seal on board,\r\nwhich was caught on the Island of Papa. He says:--\"It refuses all\r\nnourishment; it is very young, and about three feet long; it roars\r\nnearly like a calf, but not so loud, and continually crawls about the\r\ndeck, seeking to get again to sea. As I cannot bear its cries, I intend\r\nto return it to the giver. Several of them have been tamed by the\r\nShetlanders, and these will attend their owners to the place where the\r\ncows are milked, in order to get a drink. This was the case with one Mr\r\nHenry of Burrastow brought up. When it thought proper it would go to sea\r\nand forage there, but was sure to return to land, and to its owner. They\r\ntell me that it is a creature of considerable sagacity. The young seal\r\nmentioned above made his escape over the gangway, and got to sea. I am\r\nglad of it; for its plaintive lowing was painful to me. We saw it\r\nafterwards making its way to the ocean.\"[145]\r\n\r\n\r\nDR EDMONSTON ON SHETLAND SEALS.\r\n\r\nEvery one familiar with seals is struck with their plaintive,\r\nintelligent faces, and any one who has seen the seals from time to time\r\nliving in the Zoological Gardens must have been pleased with the marks\r\nof attention paid by them to their keepers. Dr Edmonston of Balta Sound\r\nhas published in the \"Memoirs of the Wernerian Society\"[146] a graphic\r\nand valuable paper on the distinctions, history, and hunting of seals in\r\nthe Shetland Isles. As that gentleman is a native of Unst, and had, when\r\nhe wrote the Memoir, been for more than twenty years actively engaged in\r\ntheir pursuit, both as an amusement and as a study, we may extract two\r\nor three interesting passages.\r\n\r\nHe remarks (p. 29) on the singular circumstance that so few additions\r\nhave been made to the list of domestic animals bequeathed to us from\r\nremote antiquity, and mentions the practicability of an attempt being\r\nmade to tame seals; and also says that it is yet to be learned whether\r\nthey would breed in captivity and remain reclaimed from the wild state.\r\nThe few instances recorded in books of natural history of tame seals\r\nrefer to the species called _Phoca vitulina_, but of the processes of\r\nrearing and education we have no details. \"The trials,\" continues Dr\r\nEdmonston, \"I have made on these points have been equally numerous on\r\nthe great as on the common seal. By far the most interesting one I ever\r\nhad was a young male of the _barbata_ species: he was taken by myself\r\nfrom a cave when only a few hours old, and in a day or two became as\r\nattached as a dog to me. The varied movements and sounds by which he\r\nexpressed delight at my presence and regret at my absence were most\r\naffecting; these sounds were as like as possible to the inarticulate\r\ntones of the human voice. I know no animal capable of displaying more\r\naffection than he did, and his temper was the gentlest imaginable. I\r\nkept him for four or five weeks, feeding him entirely on warm milk from\r\nthe cow; in my temporary absence butter-milk was given to him, and he\r\ndied soon after.\r\n\r\n\"Another was a female, also of the great seal species, which we captured\r\nin a cave when about six weeks old, in October 1830. This individual\r\nwould never allow herself to be handled but by the person who chiefly\r\nhad the charge of her, yet even she soon became comparatively familiar.\r\n\r\n\"It was amusing to see how readily she ascended the stairs, which she\r\noften did, intent, as it seemed, on examining every room in the house;\r\non showing towards her signs of displeasure and correction, she\r\ndescended more rapidly and safely than her awkwardness seemed to\r\npromise.\r\n\r\n\"She was fed from the first on fresh fish alone, and grew and fattened\r\nconsiderably. We had her carried down daily in a hand-barrow to the\r\nsea-side, where an old excavation admitting the salt water was\r\nabundantly roomy and deep for her recreation and our observation. After\r\nsporting and diving for some time she would come ashore, and seemed\r\nperfectly to understand the use of the barrow. Often she tried to waddle\r\nfrom the house to the water, or from the latter to her apartment, but\r\nfinding this fatiguing, and seeing preparations by her chairman, she\r\nwould of her own accord mount her palanquin, and thus be carried as\r\ncomposedly as any Hindoo princess. By degrees we ventured to let her go\r\nfairly into the sea, and she regularly returned after a short interval;\r\nbut one day during a thick fall of snow she was imprudently let off as\r\nusual, and, being decoyed some distance out of sight of the shore by\r\nsome wild ones which happened to be in the bay at the time, she either\r\ncould not find her way back or voluntarily decamped.\r\n\r\n\"She was, we understood, killed very shortly after in a neighbouring\r\ninlet. We had kept her about six months, and every moment she was\r\nbecoming more familiar; we had dubbed her Finna, and she seemed to know\r\nher name. Every one that saw her was struck with her appearance.\r\n\r\n\"The smooth face without external ears--the nose slightly aquiline--the\r\nlarge, dark, and beautiful eye which stood the sternest human gaze, gave\r\nto the expression of her countenance such dignity and variety that we\r\nall agreed that it really was _super_-animal. The Scandinavian Scald,\r\nwith such a mermaid before him, would find in her eye a metaphor so\r\nemphatic that he would have no reason to borrow the favourite oriental\r\nimage of the gazelles from his Caucasian ancestors.\r\n\r\n\"This remarkable expressiveness and dignity of aspect of the\r\n_Haff-fish_, so superior to all other animals with which the fishermen\r\nof Shetland were acquainted, and the human character of his voice, may\r\nhave procured for him that peculiar respect with which he was regarded\r\nby those who lived nearest his domains, and were admitted to most\r\nfrequent intercourse with him. He was the favourite animal of\r\nsuperstition, and a few tales of him are still current. These, however,\r\nare not of much interest or variety, the leading ideas in them being\r\nthese: That the great seal is a human soul, or a fallen angel in\r\nmetempsychosis, and that to him who is remarkable for hostility to the\r\nphocal race some fatal retribution will ensue. I can easily conceive the\r\nfeeling of awe with which a fisherman would be impressed when, in the\r\nsombre magnificence of some rocky solitude, a great seal suddenly\r\npresented himself, for an interview of this kind once occurred to\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\"I was lying one calm summer day on a rock a little elevated above the\r\nwater, watching the approach of seals, in a small creek formed by\r\nfrowning precipices several hundred feet high, near the north point of\r\nthe Shetland Islands.\r\n\r\n\"I had patiently waited for two hours, and the scene and the sunshine\r\nhad thrown me into a kind of reverie, when my companion, who was more\r\nawake, arrested my attention. A full-sized female haff-fish was swimming\r\nslowly past, within eight yards of my feet, her head askance, and her\r\neyes fixed upon me; the gun, charged with two balls, was immediately\r\npointed. I followed her with the aim for some distance, when she dived\r\nwithout my firing.\r\n\r\n\"I resolved that this omission should not recur, if she afforded me\r\nanother opportunity of a shot, which I hardly hoped for, but which\r\nactually in a few moments took place. Still I did not fire, until, when\r\nat a considerable distance, she was on the eve of diving, and she eluded\r\nthe shot by springing to a side. Here was really a species of\r\nfascination. The wild scene, the near presence and commanding aspect of\r\nthe splendid animal before me, produced a spellbound impression which,\r\nin my sporting experience, I never felt before.\r\n\r\n\"On reflection, I was delighted that she escaped.\r\n\r\n\"The younger seals are the more easy to tame, but the more difficult to\r\nrear; under a month old they must be fed, and, especially the _barbata_,\r\nalmost entirely on milk, and that of the cow seems hardly to agree with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps their being suckled by a cow fed chiefly on fish, the giving\r\nthem occasionally a little salt water, and then by degrees inducing them\r\nto eat fish, might be the best mode until they attained the age of being\r\nsustained on fish alone. In the _barbata_, to insure rapid taming, it\r\nappears to be necessary to capture them before the period of casting the\r\nfoetal hair, analogous to what I have observed in the case of the\r\nyoung of water-birds before getting up their first feathers, and when\r\nthey are entirely covered with the egg down.\r\n\r\n\"These changes seem connected with a great development of the wild\r\nhabits, and attachment to, and knowledge of, the localities where they\r\nhave first seen the light. As the _barbata_ is until this period in\r\nreality a land animal, the chief difficulty we have to surmount with it\r\nis in the quality of the milk to be given it. The _vitulina_ is\r\nessentially an inhabitant of the water from its birth, yet the care of\r\nthe mother is perhaps for weeks necessary to judge how long and how\r\noften it should be on land, and this we can hardly expect to imitate. In\r\nthe young of this species a few days old, which we have tried to rear, a\r\nwant of knowledge of this kind of management may have led to failure. I\r\nhave not attempted to rear them at a greater age.\r\n\r\n\"The Greenland seal is, I have been informed, occasionally kept for a\r\nmonth or two on board the whalers, and thrives sufficiently well on the\r\nflesh of sea-birds. This species appears to bring forth in January, and\r\ntherefore it is subjected to captivity.\r\n\r\n\"I know but comparatively little of its capability of being easily\r\ntamed; but this quality, of itself, is no evidence of superior\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n\"Might it not be easy to induce Greenland shipmasters to bring some of\r\nthese animals to England, where they would be accessible to the\r\nobservation of zoologists.\r\n\r\n\"One mode of attempting to tame them might be to take half-grown animals\r\nin a net, or surprise them on land, and then keep them in salt-water\r\nponds in a semi-domestic state: if any of them were pregnant when\r\ncaught, or could be got to breed, the main difficulty would be\r\novercome.\"\r\n\r\nLong as these extracts are, they possess great interest as being derived\r\nfrom observations on living animals made by one who was a friend of the\r\nDuke of Wellington, and was always welcomed by him. His northern Island\r\nof Unst is a fine field for studying marine animals. The sweeping\r\ncurrents of the Arctic oceans bring creatures to the quiet voes and\r\nsounds. Shetland in spring, summer, and autumn is a favoured locality\r\nfor the naturalist and painter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WALRUS.\r\n\r\nThere was some likelihood, a few years ago, that a most attractive\r\nanimal would be added to the collection of the Zoological Society. But,\r\nunfortunately for the public gratification, as well as the remuneration\r\nof the spirited captain who brought the creature, it reached the gardens\r\nin a dying state, and only survived a few days. But it is not the first\r\nof its family which has travelled so far to the southward. Nearly 250\r\nyears ago a specimen was brought alive by some of the Arctic\r\nadventurers, and excited no little surprise, as old Purchas tells us. It\r\nwas in the year 1608, when \"the king and many honourable personages\r\nbeheld it with admiration, for the strangeness of the same, the like\r\nwhereof had never before beene seene alive in England. Not long after it\r\nfell sicke and died. As the beast in shape is very strange, so is it of\r\nstrange docilitie, and apt to be taught, as by good experience we often\r\nproved.\"\r\n\r\nThe figure which accompanies this paper was drawn from our late lamented\r\nvisitor by Mr Wolf, who sketched it before its removal to the Zoological\r\nGardens. Captain Henry caught it during a whaling expedition, and sent\r\nit to London. Though quite young, it was nearly four feet in length; and\r\nwhen the person who used to feed it came into the room, it would give\r\nhim an affectionate greeting, in a voice somewhat resembling the cry of\r\na calf, but considerably louder. It walked about, but, owing to its\r\nweakness, soon grew tired, and lay down. Unlike the seals, to which it\r\nis closely allied, the walrus has considerable power with its limbs when\r\nout of the water, and can support its bulky body quite clear of the\r\nground. Its mode of progression, however, is awkward when compared with\r\nordinary quadrupeds; its hind-limbs shuffling along, as if inclosed in a\r\nsack. In some future season, when a lively specimen reaches the Gardens,\r\nand is accommodated with an extensive tank of water, there is no reason\r\nwhy the walrus should not thrive as well as the seal, or his close,\r\nthough not kind, neighbour of the North, the Polar bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Walrus.]\r\n\r\nThe walrus, _morse_, or _sea-horse_ (_Trichechus rosmarus_, Linn.[147]),\r\nis one of the most characteristic inhabitants of the Arctic regions.\r\nThere it is widely distributed, and thence it seldom wanders. One or two\r\nspecimens were killed on the shores of the northern Scottish islands in\r\n1817 and 1825; but these instances seem hardly to admit of its\r\nintroduction into our _fauna_, any more than West Indian beans, brought\r\nby the currents, are admissible into our _flora_. It is mentioned by\r\nsome old Scottish writers[148] among our native animals, and at one time\r\nmay have been carried to our coasts on some of the bergs, which are\r\noccasionally seen in the German Ocean after the periodical disruptions\r\nof the Arctic ice. Like the Polar bear, however, the walrus has\r\nevidently been formed by its Creator for a life among icy seas, and\r\nthere it is now found often in large herds. Captain Beechey and other\r\nvoyagers to the seas around Spitzbergen, describe them as being\r\nparticularly abundant on the western coast of that inclement island. The\r\ncaptain says that in fine weather they resort to large pieces of ice at\r\nthe edge of the main body, where herds of them may be seen of sometimes\r\nmore than a hundred individuals each. \"In these situations they appear\r\ngreatly to enjoy themselves, rolling and sporting about, and frequently\r\nmaking the air resound with their bellowing, which bears some\r\nresemblance to that of a bull. These diversions generally end in sleep,\r\nduring which these wary animals appear always to take the precaution of\r\nhaving a sentinel to warn them of any danger.\" The only warning,\r\nhowever, which the sentinel gives, is by seeking his own safety; in\r\neffecting which, as the herd lie huddled on one another like swine, the\r\nmotion of one is speedily communicated to the whole, and they instantly\r\ntumble, one over the other, into the sea, head-foremost, if possible;\r\nbut failing that, anyhow.\r\n\r\nScoresby remarks that the front part of the head of the young walrus,\r\nwithout tusks, when seen at a distance, is not unlike the human face. It\r\nhas the habit of raising its head above the water to look at ships and\r\nother passing objects; and when seen in such a position, it may have\r\ngiven rise to some of the stories of mermaids.\r\n\r\nThere is still a considerable uncertainty as to the food of the walrus.\r\nCook found no traces of aliment in the stomachs of those shot by his\r\nparty. Crantz says that in Greenland shell-fish and sea-weeds seem to be\r\nits only subsistence. Scoresby found shrimps, a kind of craw-fish, and\r\nthe remains of young seals, in the stomachs of those which he examined.\r\nBecchey mentions, that in the inside of several specimens he found\r\nnumerous granite pebbles larger than walnuts. These may be taken for the\r\nsame purpose that some birds, especially of the gallinaceous order,\r\nswallow bits of gravel. Dr Von Baer concludes, from an analysis of all\r\nthe published accounts, that the walrus is omnivorous.[149] A specimen\r\nthat died at St Petersburg was fed on oatmeal mixed with turnips or\r\nother vegetables; and the little fellow, who lately died in the Regent's\r\nPark, seems to have been fed by the sailors on oatmeal porridge.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief characteristics of the walrus is the presence of two\r\nelongated tusks (the canine teeth) in the upper jaw. According to\r\nCrantz, it uses these to scrape mussels and other shell-fish from the\r\nrocks and out of the sand, and also to grapple and get along with, for\r\nthey enable it to raise itself on the ice. They are also powerful\r\nweapons of defence against the Polar bear and its other enemies.\r\n\r\nThe walrus attains a great size. Twelve feet is the length of a fine\r\nspecimen in the British Museum. Beechey's party found some of them\r\nfourteen feet in length and nine feet in girth, and of such prodigious\r\nweight that they could scarcely turn them over.\r\n\r\nGratifying accounts are given of the attachment of the female to its\r\nyoung, and the male occasionally assists in their defence when exposed\r\nto danger, or at least in revenging the attack. Lord Nelson, when a lad,\r\nwas coxwain to one of the ships of Phipps's expedition to the Arctic\r\nseas, and commanded a boat, which was the means of saving a party\r\nbelonging to the other ship from imminent danger. \"Some of the officers\r\nhad fired at and wounded a walrus. As no other animal,\" says Southey,\r\n\"has so human-like an expression in its countenance, so also is there\r\nnone that seems to possess more of the passions of humanity. The wounded\r\nanimal dived immediately, and brought up a number of its companions; and\r\nthey all joined in an attack upon the boat. They wrested an oar from one\r\nof the men; and it was with the utmost difficulty that the crew could\r\nprevent them from staving or upsetting her, till the _Carcass's_ boat\r\n(commanded by young Horatio Nelson) came up: and the walruses, finding\r\ntheir enemies thus reinforced, dispersed.\" And Captain Beechey gives the\r\nfollowing pleasing picture of maternal affection which he witnessed in\r\nthe seas around Spitzbergen: \"We were greatly amused by the singular and\r\naffectionate conduct of a walrus towards its young. In the vast sheet of\r\nice which surrounded the ships, there were occasionally many pools; and\r\nwhen the weather was clear and warm, animals of various kinds would\r\nfrequently rise and sport about in them, or crawl from thence upon the\r\nice to bask in the warmth of the sun. A walrus rose in one of these\r\npools close to the ship, and, finding everything quiet, dived down and\r\nbrought up its young, which it held to its breast by pressing it with\r\nits flipper. In this manner it moved about the pool, keeping in an erect\r\nposture, and always directing the face of the young towards the vessel.\r\nOn the slightest movement on board, the mother released her flipper, and\r\npushed the young one under water; but, when everything was again quiet,\r\nbrought it up as before, and for a length of time continued to play\r\nabout in the pool, to the great amusement of the seamen, who gave her\r\ncredit for abilities in tuition, which, though possessed of considerable\r\nsagacity, she hardly merited.\"\r\n\r\nThe walrus has two great enemies in its icy home--the Polar bear and the\r\nEsquimaux. Captain Beechey thus graphically describes the manoeuvres\r\nof that king of the Bruin race, which must often be attended with\r\nsuccess. The bears, when hungry, are always on the watch for animals\r\nsleeping upon the ice, and try to come on them unawares, as their prey\r\ndarts through holes in the ice. \"One sunshiny day a walrus, of nine or\r\nten feet length, rose in a pool of water not very far from us; and after\r\nlooking around, drew his greasy carcase upon the ice, where he rolled\r\nabout for a time, and at length laid himself down to sleep. A bear,\r\nwhich had probably been observing his movements, crawled carefully upon\r\nthe ice on the opposite side of the pool, and began to roll about also,\r\nbut apparently more with design than amusement, as he progressively\r\nlessened the distance that intervened between him and his prey. The\r\nwalrus, suspicious of his advances, drew himself up preparatory to a\r\nprecipitate retreat into the water in case of a nearer acquaintance with\r\nhis playful but treacherous visitor; on which the bear was instantly\r\nmotionless, as if in the act of sleep; but after a time began to lick\r\nhis paws, and clean himself, occasionally encroaching a little more upon\r\nhis intended prey. But even this artifice did not succeed; the wary\r\nwalrus was far too cunning to allow himself to be entrapped, and\r\nsuddenly plunged into the pool; which the bear no sooner observed than\r\nhe threw off all disguise, rushed towards the spot, and followed him in\r\nan instant into the water, where, I fear, he was as much disappointed in\r\nhis meal, as we were of the pleasure of witnessing a very interesting\r\nencounter.\"\r\n\r\nThe meat of the walrus is not despised by Europeans, and its heart is\r\nreckoned a delicacy. To the Esquimaux there is no greater treat than a\r\nkettle well filled with walrus-blubber; and to the natives along\r\nBehring's Straits this quadruped is as valuable as is the palm to the\r\nsons of the desert. Their canoes are covered with its skin; their\r\nweapons and sledge-runners, and many useful articles, are formed from\r\nits tusks; their lamps are filled with its oil; and they themselves are\r\nfed with its fat and its fibre. So thick is the skin, that a bayonet is\r\nalmost the only weapon which can pierce it. Cut into shreds, it makes\r\nexcellent cordage, being especially adapted for wheel-ropes. The tusks\r\nbear a high commercial value, and are extensively employed by dentists\r\nin the manufacture of artificial teeth. The fat of a good-sized specimen\r\nyields thirty gallons of oil.--_A.

When that was written, and for long after, it may be\r\nnecessary to tell some, Australia was chiefly known as the land of the\r\nconvict.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" writes Elia, \"what your Sidneyites do?

Cooke told of Admiral Cotton once (at Lisbon, I think) saying\r\nduring dinner, \"Make signals for the _Kangaroo_ to get under way;\" and\r\nCooke, who had just been expressing his anxiety to leave Lisbon, thought\r\nthe speech alluded to his nickname, and considered it an extraordinary\r\nliberty for one who knew so little of him as Admiral Cotton to take. He\r\nfound out afterwards, however, that his namesake was a sloop-of-war.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[150] \"Distant Correspondents,\" in the Essays of Elia, first series ed.\r\n1841, p. 67.\r\n\r\n[151] Jesse's \"Life of Beau Brummell,\" vol. i. p. 288.\r\n\r\n[152] \"Memoirs, Correspondence,\" &c., edited by Lord John Russell, vol.\r\niii. p. 179.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TIGER-WOLF.\r\n\r\n(_Thylacinus cynocephalus._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great order, or rather division, of mammalia, the\r\n_Marsupialia_,[153] is furnished with a pouch, into which the young are\r\nreceived and nourished at a very early period of their existence. The\r\nfirst species of the group, known to voyagers and naturalists, was the\r\ncelebrated opossum of North America, whose instinctive care to defend\r\nitself from danger causes it to feign the appearance of death. As the\r\ngreat continent of Australia became known, it was found that the great\r\nmass of its mammalia, from the gigantic kangaroo to the pigmy,\r\nmouse-like potoroo, belonged to this singular order. The order contains\r\na most anomalous set of animals, some being exclusively carnivorous,\r\nsome chiefly subsisting on insects, while others browse on grass; and\r\nmany live on fruits and leaves, which they climb trees to procure; a\r\nsmaller portion subsisting on roots, for which they burrow in the\r\nground. The gentle and deer-faced kangaroo belongs to this order; the\r\ncurious bandicoots, the tree-frequenting phalangers and petauri, the\r\nsavage \"native devil,\"[154] and the voracious subject of this notice.\r\n\r\nThe \"tiger-wolf\" is a native of Van Diemen's Land, and is strictly\r\nconfined to that island. It was first described in the ninth volume of\r\nthe \"Linnean Transactions,\" under the name of _Didelphis cynocephalus_,\r\nor \"dog-headed opossum,\" the English name being an exact translation of\r\nits Latin one. Its non-prehensile tail, peculiar feet, and different\r\narrangement of teeth, pointed out to naturalists that it entered into a\r\ngenus distinct from the American opossums; and to this genus the name of\r\n_Thylacinus_[155] has been applied; its specific name _cynocephalus_\r\nbeing still retained in conformity with zoological nomenclature,\r\nalthough M. Temminck, the founder of the genus, honoured the species\r\nwith the name of its first describer, and called it _Thylacinus\r\nHarrisii_.\r\n\r\nMr Gould has given a short account of this quadruped in his great work,\r\n\"The Mammals of Australia,\" accompanied with two plates, one showing the\r\nhead of the male, of the natural size, in such a point of view as to\r\nexhibit the applicability of one of the names applied to it by the\r\ncolonists, that of \"zebra-wolf.\" He justly remarks that it must be\r\nregarded as by far the most formidable of all the marsupial animals, as\r\nit certainly is the most savage indigenous quadruped belonging to the\r\nAustralian continent. Although it is too feeble to make a successful\r\nattack on man, it commits great havoc among the smaller quadrupeds of\r\nthe country; and to the settler it is a great object of dread, as his\r\npoultry and other domestic animals are never safe from its attacks. His\r\nsheep are, especially, an object of the colonist's anxious care, as he\r\ncan house his poultry, and thus secure them from the prowler; but his\r\nflocks, wandering about over the country, are liable to be attacked at\r\nnight by the tiger-wolf, whose habits are strictly nocturnal. Mr Gunn\r\nhas seen some so large and powerful that a number of dogs would not face\r\none of them. It has become an object with the settler to destroy every\r\nspecimen he can fall in with, so that it is much rarer than it was at\r\nthe time Mr Harris, its first describer, wrote its history, at least in\r\nthe cultivated districts. Much, however, of Van Diemen's Land is still\r\nin a state of nature, and as large tracts of forest-land remain yet\r\nuncleared, there is abundance of covert for it still in the more remote\r\nparts of the colony, and it is even now often seen at Woolnoth and among\r\nthe Hampshire hills. In such places it feeds on the smaller species of\r\nkangaroos and other marsupials,--bandicoots, and kangaroo-rats, while\r\neven the prickle-covered echidna--a much more formidable mouthful than\r\nany hedgehog--supplies the tiger-wolf with a portion of its sustenance.\r\nThe specimen described by Mr Harris was caught in a trap baited with the\r\nflesh of the kangaroo. When opened, the remains of a half-digested\r\nechidna[156] were found in its stomach.\r\n\r\nThe tiger-wolf has a certain amount of daintiness in its appetite when\r\nin a state of nature. From the observations of Mr Gunn it would seem\r\nthat nothing will induce it to prey on the wombat,[157] a fat, sluggish,\r\nmarsupial quadruped, abundant in the districts which it frequents, and\r\nwhose flesh would seem to be very edible, seeing that it lives on fruits\r\nand roots. No sooner, however, was the sheep introduced than the\r\ntiger-wolf began to attack the flocks, and has ever since shown a most\r\nunmistakable appetite for mutton, preferring the flesh of that most\r\nuseful and easily-mastered quadruped to that of any kangaroo however\r\nvenison-like, or bandicoot however savoury. The colonists of Van\r\nDiemen's land have applied various names to this animal, according as\r\nits resemblance to other ferocious quadrupeds of different climates\r\nstruck their fancy. The names of \"tiger,\" \"hyena,\" and \"zebra-wolf,\" are\r\npartly acquired from its ferocity, somewhat corresponding with that of\r\nthese well-known carnivorous denizens of other lands, and partly from\r\nthe black bands which commence behind the shoulders, and which extend in\r\nlength on the haunches, and resemble in some faint measure those on the\r\nbarred tyrant of the Indian jungles, and the other somewhat similarly\r\nornamented mammalia implied in the names. These bars are well relieved\r\nby the general grayish-brown colour of the fur, which is somewhat woolly\r\nin its texture, from each of the hairs of which it is composed being\r\nwaved.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in the Zoological Gardens are very shy and restless; when\r\nalarmed they dash and leap about their dens and utter a short guttural\r\ncry somewhat resembling a bark. This shyness is partly to be attributed\r\nto their imperfect vision by day, and partly to their resemblance in\r\ncharacter to the wolf, whose treachery and suspicious manners in\r\nconfinement must have struck every one who has gazed on this \"gaunt\r\nsavage\" in his den in the Regent's Park. The specimens exhibited are the\r\nfirst living members of the species first brought to Europe. The male\r\nwas taken in November 1849, and the female at an earlier period in the\r\nsame year, on the upper part of St Patrick's River, about thirty miles\r\nnorth-east of Launceston. After being gradually accustomed to\r\nconfinement by Mr Gunn, they were shipped for this country, and reached\r\nthe Gardens in the spring of 1850. It is very seldom, indeed, that they\r\nare caught alive; and when so caught they are generally at once killed,\r\nso that it was with some difficulty and by offering a considerable\r\npecuniary inducement to the shepherds, that they were at last secured\r\nfor the Zoological Society.[158] In their den they show great activity,\r\nand can bound upwards nearly to the roof of the place where they are\r\nconfined.--_A.

He introduces an affecting little incident: \"So completely cold\r\nand drenched was everything outside, that a poor little lemming, unable\r\nto contend with the floods, which had driven it successively from all\r\nits retreats, crept silently under the tent, and snuggled away in\r\nprecarious security within a few paces of a sleeping terrier.\r\nUnconscious of its danger, it licked its fur coat, and darted its bright\r\neyes from object to object, as if pleased and surprised with its new\r\nquarters; but soon the pricked ears of the awakened dog announced its\r\nfate, and in another instant the poor little stranger was quivering in\r\nhis jaws!\"[161]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr McDougall?][162] records several amusing anecdotes of the little\r\narctic lemming, named _Arctomys Spermophilus Parryi_, after the great\r\narctic voyager. He says,--\"My own experience of those industrious little\r\nwarriors tended to prove that they possessed a strange combination of\r\nsociality and combativeness. Industrious they most certainly are, as is\r\nshown by the complicated excavation of their subterranean cities;\r\nbesides which, every feather and hair of bird and animal found in the\r\nvicinity of their dwellings, is made to contribute its iota of warmth\r\nand comfort to the interior of their winter quarters.\r\n\r\n\"I had,\" continues the master of the _Resolute_, \"many opportunities of\r\nwatching their movements during my detention at Winter Harbour. My tent\r\nhappened to be pitched immediately over one of their large towns,\r\ncausing its inhabitants to issue forth from its thousand gates to catch\r\na view of the strangers. Frequently on waking we have found the little\r\nanimals, rolled up in a ball, snugly ensconced within the folds of our\r\nblanket-bags; nor would they be expelled from such a warm and desirable\r\nposition without showing fight. On several occasions I observed Naps,\r\nthe dog, fast asleep with one or two lemmings huddled away between its\r\nlegs, like so many pups.\"\r\n\r\nHe says that Lieutenant Mecham noticed an Esquimaux dog, named Buffer,\r\ntrudging along, nose to the ground, quite unconscious of danger, when a\r\nlemming, suddenly starting from its cavern, seized poor Buffer by the\r\nnose, inflicting a severe wound. The dog, astounded at such an\r\nunsuspected assault, gave a dismal howl, and at length shook the enemy\r\noff, after which he became the attacking party, and in less than a\r\nminute the presumptuous assailant disappeared between the jaws of the\r\nTartar he had attempted to catch.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[158] Mitchell's \"Popular Guide to the Zoological Gardens,\" p. 9.\r\n(1852.)\r\n\r\n[159] Mark Lemon's \"Jest Book,\" p. 180.\r\n\r\n[160] Ed. 1845, p. 339.\r\n\r\n[161] P. 441.

They are terrible nuisances, and yet rat-skins are said to\r\nbe manufactured in Paris into gloves.\r\n\r\nSydney Smith's comparison of some one dying like a poisoned rat in a\r\nditch is a powerful one. The same writer, in hunting down an unworthy\r\nman, with his cutting criticism, says, that he did it not on account of\r\nhis power, but to put down what might prove noisome if not settled, much\r\nas a Dutch burgomaster might hunt a rat, not for its value, but because\r\nby its boring it might cause the water to break through his dikes, and\r\nthus flood his native land.\r\n\r\nRobert Browning, in one of his poems, \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin,\" has\r\npowerfully described an incursion of rats. A few lines may be quoted:--\r\n\r\n   \"Almost five hundred years ago,\r\n   To see the townsfolk suffer so\r\n     From vermin, was a pity.\r\n     \"Rats!\r\n   They fought the dogs and killed the cats,\r\n     And bit the babies in their cradles,\r\n   And ate the cheeses out of the vats,\r\n     And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles,\r\n   Split open the kegs of salted sprats,\r\n   Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,\r\n   And even spoiled the women's chats,\r\n       By drowning their speaking\r\n       With shrieking and squeaking\r\n   In fifty different sharps and flats.\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   \"And ere three shrill notes the pipes had uttered,\r\n   You heard as if an army muttered;\r\n   And the muttering grew to a grumbling;\r\n   And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;\r\n   And out of the houses the rats came tumbling--\r\n   Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,\r\n   Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats;\r\n   Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,\r\n       Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,\r\n   Cocking tails, and pricking whiskers,\r\n       Families by tens and dozens,\r\n   Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives--\r\n   Followed the Piper for their lives.\r\n   From street to street he piped, advancing,\r\n   And step for step they followed dancing,\r\n   Until they came to the river Weser\r\n   Wherein all plunged and perished,\r\n   Save one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUKE OF WELLINGTON AND THE MUSK-RAT.\r\n\r\nMr Taylor, in his notes to the artist Haydon's Autobiography, tells us\r\nthat a favourite expression of the Duke of Wellington, when people tried\r\nto coax him to do what he had resolved not to do, was, \"The rat has got\r\ninto the bottle.\" This not very intelligible expression may refer to an\r\nanecdote I have heard of the Duke's once telling, in his later days, how\r\nthe musk-rats in India got into bottles, which ever after retained the\r\nodour of musk. \"Either the rats must be very small,\" said a lady who\r\nheard him, \"or the bottles very large.\" \"On the contrary, madam,\" was\r\nthe Duke's reply, \"very small bottles and very large rats.\" \"That is the\r\nstyle of logic we have to deal with at the Horse Guards,\" whispered Lord\r\n----.\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY EGLINTOUN AND THE RATS.\r\n\r\nMr Robert Chambers, in his \"Traditions of Edinburgh\" (p. 191), gives an\r\ninteresting account of the elegant Susanna, Countess of Eglintoun, who\r\nwas in her eighty-fifth year when Johnson and Boswell visited her. She\r\ndied in 1780, at the age of ninety-one, having preserved to the last her\r\nstately mien and fine complexion. She is said to have washed her face\r\nperiodically with sow's milk.\r\n\r\n\"This venerable woman amused herself latterly in taming and patronising\r\nrats. She kept a vast number of these animals in her pay at Auchans, and\r\nthey succeeded in her affections the poets and artists she had loved in\r\nearly life. It does not reflect much credit upon the latter, that her\r\nladyship used to complain of never having met with true gratitude\r\nexcept from four-footed animals. She had a panel in the oak wainscot of\r\nher dining-room, which she tapped upon and opened at meal times, when\r\nten or twelve jolly rats came tripping forth, and joined her at table.\r\nAt the word of command or a signal from her ladyship, they retired again\r\nto their native obscurity--a trait of good sense in the character and\r\nhabits of the animals which, it is hardly necessary to remark, patrons\r\ndo not always find in two-legged _protégés_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DOUGLAS AND THE RATS.\r\n\r\nThe biographer of this highly-distinguished military engineer-officer\r\nrelates an anecdote of him when a lieutenant at Tynemouth. The future\r\nauthor of well-known works on Gunnery and Military Bridges, early began\r\nto show ability in mechanics. \"Lieutenant Douglas occupied a room barely\r\nhabitable, and had to contest the tenancy with rats, which asserted\r\ntheir claim with such tenacity, that he went to sleep at the risk of\r\nbeing devoured. Their incursions compelled him to furnish himself with\r\nloaded pistols and a tinder-box, and he kept watch one night, remaining\r\nquiet till there was an irruption, when he started up and struck a\r\nlight. But his vigilance proved of no avail, for the clink of the flint\r\nand steel caused a stampede, and not a rat remained by the time he had\r\nkindled the tinder. Their flight suggested to him another device. He\r\nlooked out all the holes, and covered them with slides, connected with\r\neach other by wires, and these he fastened to a string, which enabled\r\nhim to draw them all with one pull, and thus close the outlets. The\r\ncontrivance claims to be mentioned as his first success in mechanics,\r\nforeshadowing his future expertness. It came into use the same night: he\r\npulled the string without rising from bed, then struck a light, while\r\nthe rats flew off to the holes to find them blocked, and he shot them at\r\nleisure. Two or three such massacres cleared off the intruders, and left\r\nhim undisturbed in his quarters.\"[163]\r\n\r\n\r\nHANOVER RATS.\r\n\r\nHow amusingly does Mr Waterton show his attachment to the extinct\r\nStuarts in his essays. Go where he may, \"a Hanover rat\" pops up before\r\nhim. In his charming autobiography appended to the three series of his\r\ngraphic essays, whether he be in Rome or Cologne, in York or London, at\r\na farm-house, or on board a steamer on the Rhine, \"a Hanover rat\" is\r\nsure to be encountered. We could cite many amusing illustrations.\r\n\r\nEarl Stanhope[164] speaks of the Jacobites after the death of Anne\r\nreviling all adherents of the court as \"a parcel of Roundheads and\r\nHanover rats.\" This is the phrase used by Squire Western in Fielding's\r\nnovel of \"Tom Jones.\" He tells us that the former of these titles was\r\nthe by-word first applied to the Calvinistic preachers in the civil\r\nwars, from the close cropped hair which they affected as distinguished\r\nfrom the flowing curls of the cavaliers. The second phrase was of far\r\nmore recent origin. It so chanced that not long after the accession of\r\nthe House of Hanover, some of the brown, that is, the German or Norway\r\nrats, were first brought over to this country in some timber, as is\r\nsaid; and being much stronger than the black, or till then, the common\r\nrats, they in many places quite extirpated the latter. The word, both\r\nthe noun and the verb \"to rat,\" was first levelled at the converts to\r\nthe government of George the First, but has by degrees obtained a wider\r\nmeaning, and come to be applied to any sudden and mercenary change in\r\npolitics. The ravages of rats might form the subject of a curious\r\nvolume. They are not at all literary in their tastes, though they are\r\nknown to eat through bales of books, should they be placed in the way of\r\ntheir runs. The booksellers in the Row always leave room between the\r\nwall and the books in their cellars, to allow room for this predacious\r\nvermin.\r\n\r\nMr Cole, when examined before the Committee of the House on the\r\ncondition of the depositories of the Records some time ago, stated that\r\n\"six or seven perfect skeletons of rats were found imbedded (in the\r\nRolls); bones of these vermin were generally distributed throughout the\r\nmass, and a dog was employed in hunting the live ones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISHMAN EMPLOYED SHOOTING RATS.\r\n\r\nLuttrell visited Sydney Smith at his parsonage in Somersetshire. The\r\nLondon wit told some amusing Irish stories, and his manner of telling\r\nthem was so good. \"One: 'Is your master at home, Paddy?' '_No_, your\r\nhonour.' 'Why, I saw him go in five minutes ago.' 'Faith, your honour,\r\nhe's not exactly at home; he's only there in the back yard a-shooting\r\nrats with cannon, your honour, for his _devarsion_.'\"[165]\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES WATT AND THE RAT'S WHISKERS.\r\n\r\nMrs Schimmelpenninck in her youth lived at Birmingham, where she often\r\nmet James Watt. In her autobiography (p. 34), she says, \"Everybody\r\npractically knew the infinite variety of his talents and stores of\r\nknowledge. When Mr Watt entered a room, men of letters, men of science,\r\nnay, military men, artists, ladies, even little children thronged round\r\nhim. I remember a celebrated Swedish artist having been instructed by\r\nhim that rats' whiskers made the most pliant and elastic painting-brush;\r\nladies would appeal to him on the best means of devising grates, curing\r\nsmoky chimneys, warming their houses, and obtaining fast colours. I can\r\nspeak from experience of his teaching me how to make a dulcimer, and\r\nimprove a Jew's harp.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POET GRAY COMPARES THE POET-LAUREATE TO A RAT-CATCHER.\r\n\r\nThe poet Gray very much despised such offices as that of the\r\npoet-laureate, or that held by Elkanah Settle, the last of the city\r\npoets whose name is held up to ridicule by Pope in the \"Dunciad.\" In a\r\nletter to the Rev. Wm. Mason,[166] he puts this very strikingly:--\r\n\r\n\"Though I very well know the bland emolient saponaceous qualities both\r\nof sack and silver, yet if any great man would say to me, 'I make you\r\nrat-catcher to his Majesty, with a salary of £300 a year, and two butts\r\nof the best Malaga; and though it has been usual to catch a mouse or\r\ntwo, for form's sake, in public once a year, yet to you, sir, we shall\r\nnot stand upon these things,' I cannot say I should jump at it; nay, if\r\nthey would drop the very name of the office, and call me Sinecure to the\r\nKing's Majesty, I should still feel a little awkward, and think\r\neverybody I saw smelt a rat about me: but I do not pretend to blame any\r\none else that has not the same sensations. For my part, I would rather\r\nbe serjeant-trumpeter or pinmaker to the palace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJEREMY BENTHAM AND THE MICE.\r\n\r\nThe biographer of Jeremy Bentham[167] tells us that among the animals he\r\nwas fond of were mice. They were encouraged \"to play\" about in his\r\nworkshop. I remember, when one got among his papers, that he exclaimed,\r\n\"Ho! ho! here's a mouse at work; why won't he come into my lap?--but\r\nthen I ought to be writing legislation, and that would not do.\"\r\n\r\nOne day, while we were at dinner, mice had got, as they frequently did,\r\ninto the drawers of the dinner-table, and were making no small noise. \"O\r\nyou rascals,\" exclaimed Bentham, \"there's an uproar among you. I'll tell\r\npuss of you;\" and then added, \"I became once very intimate with a\r\ncolony of mice. They used to run up my legs, and eat crumbs from my lap.\r\nI love everything that has four legs; so did George Wilson. We were fond\r\nof mice, and fond of cats; but it was difficult to reconcile the two\r\naffections.\"\r\n\r\nJeremy Bentham records: \"George Wilson had a disorder which kept him two\r\nmonths to his couch. The _mouses_ used to run up his back and eat the\r\npowder and pomatum from his hair. They used also to run up my knees when\r\nI went to see him. I remember they did so to Lord Glenbervie, who\r\nthought it odd.\"[168]\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNS AND THE FIELD MOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe history of the origin of this well-known piece of the Scottish poet\r\nis thus given by Mr Chambers in that edition of the Life and Works of\r\nRobert Burns,[169] which will ever be regarded, by Scotchmen at least,\r\nas the most complete and carefully-edited of the numerous editions of\r\nthat most popular poet.\r\n\r\n\"We have the testimony of Gilbert Burns that this beautiful poem was\r\ncomposed while the author was following the plough. Burns ploughed with\r\nfour horses, being twice the amount of power now required on most of the\r\nsoils of Scotland. He required an assistant, called a _gaudsman_, to\r\ndrive the horses, his own duty being to hold and guide the plough. John\r\nBlane, who had acted as gaudsman to Burns, and who lived sixty years\r\nafterwards, had a distinct recollection of the turning-up of the mouse.\r\nLike a thoughtless youth as he was, he ran after the creature to kill\r\nit, but was checked and recalled by his master, who, he observed, became\r\nthereafter thoughtful and abstracted. Burns, who treated his servants\r\nwith the familiarity of fellow-labourers, soon after read the poem to\r\nBlane.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A MOUSE, ON TURNING UP HER NEST WITH THE PLOUGH, NOVEMBER 1785.\r\n\r\n   \"Wee, sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie,\r\n   Oh, what a panic's in thy breastie!\r\n   Thou needna start awa sae hasty\r\n             Wi' bickering brattle!\r\n   I wad be laith to rin and chase thee\r\n             Wi' murd'ring pattle.[170]\r\n\r\n   \"I'm truly sorry man's dominion\r\n   Has broken nature's social union,\r\n   And justifies that ill opinion,\r\n             Which makes thee startle\r\n   At me, thy poor earth-born companion,\r\n             And fellow-mortal!\r\n\r\n   \"I doubt na whyles, but thou may thieve;\r\n   What then? poor beastie, thou maun live!\r\n   A daimen icker in a thrave[171]\r\n             'S a sma' request:\r\n   I'll get a blessin' wi' the laive,\r\n             And never miss't.\r\n\r\n   \"Thy wee bit housie, too, in ruin!\r\n   Its silly wa's the win's are strewin\"!\r\n   And naething now to big a new ane\r\n             O, foggage green,\r\n   And bleak December's winds ensuin'\r\n             Baith snell and keen!\r\n\r\n   \"Thou saw the fields laid bare and waste,\r\n   And weary winter coming fast,\r\n   And cozie here, beneath the blast,\r\n             Thou thought to dwell,\r\n   Till crash! the cruel coulter passed\r\n             Out through thy cell.\r\n\r\n   \"That wee bit heap o' leaves and stibble,\r\n   Has cost thee mony a weary nibble!\r\n   Now thou's turned out for a' thy trouble,\r\n             But house or hald,\r\n   To thole the winter's sleety dribble,\r\n             And cranreuch cauld!\r\n\r\n   \"But, mousie, thou art no thy lane;\r\n   Improving foresight may be vain;\r\n   The best-laid schemes o' mice and men\r\n             Gang aft a-gley,\r\n   And lea'e us nought but grief and pain\r\n             For promised joy.\r\n\r\n   \"Still thou art blest, compared wi' me!\r\n   The present only toucheth thee;\r\n   But, och!

The March following,\r\nnumberless flocks of owls from all parts flew thither, and destroyed\r\nthem, which otherwise had ruined the country, if continuing another\r\nyear. Thus, though great the distance betwixt a man and a mouse, the\r\nmeanest may become formidable to the mightiest creature by their\r\nmultitudes; and this may render the punishment of the Philistines more\r\nclearly to our apprehensions, at the same time pestered with mice in\r\ntheir barns and pained with emerods in their bodies.\"[172]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARON VON TRENCK AND THE TAME MOUSE IN PRISON.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Baron Von Trenck was a Prussian officer, whose\r\nadventures, imprisonments, and escape form the subject of memoirs which\r\nhe wrote in Hungary. He at last settled in France, and there, in 1794,\r\nperished by the guillotine.\r\n\r\nBefore he obtained his liberty, he lost a companion which had for two\r\nyears helped to beguile the solitude of his captivity. This was a mouse,\r\nwhich he had tamed so perfectly, that the little creature was\r\ncontinually playing with him, and would eat out of his mouth. \"One night\r\nit skipped about so much that the sentinels heard a noise and reported\r\nit to the officer of the guard. As the garrison had been changed at the\r\npeace (between Austria and Prussia), and as Trenck had not been able to\r\nform at once so close a connexion with the officers of the regular\r\ntroops as he had done with those of the militia, one of the former,\r\nafter ascertaining the truth of the report with his own ears, sent to\r\ninform the commandant that something extraordinary was going on in the\r\nprison. The town-major arrived in consequence early in the morning,\r\naccompanied by locksmiths and masons. The floor, the walls, the baron's\r\nchains, his body, everything in short, were strictly examined. Finding\r\nall in order, they asked the cause of the last evening's bustle. Trenck\r\nhad heard the mouse, and told them frankly by what it had been\r\noccasioned. They desired him to call his little favourite; he whistled,\r\nand the mouse immediately leaped upon his shoulder. He solicited that\r\nits life might be spared; but the officer of the guard took it into his\r\npossession, promising, however, on his word of honour, to give it to a\r\nlady who would take great care of it. Turning it afterwards loose in his\r\nchamber, the mouse, who knew nobody but Trenck, soon disappeared, and\r\nhid himself in a hole. At the usual hour of visiting his prison, when\r\nthe officers were just going away, the poor little animal darted in,\r\nclimbed up his legs, seated itself on his shoulder, and played a\r\nthousand tricks to express the joy it felt on seeing him again. Every\r\none was astonished, and wished to have it. The major, to terminate the\r\ndispute, carried it away, gave it to his wife, who had a light cage made\r\nfor it; but the mouse refused to eat, and a few days after was found\r\ndead.\"[173]\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER WILSON AND THE MOUSE.\r\n\r\nAbout the time when Alexander Wilson formed the design of drawing the\r\nAmerican birds, and writing those descriptions which, when published,\r\ngave him that name which has clung to him, \"_the American\r\nOrnithologist_\" he had a school within a few miles of Philadelphia. He\r\nwas then a keen student of the animal life around him. In 1802 he wrote\r\nto his friend Bertram, and tells him of his having had \"live crows,\r\nhawks, and owls; opossums, squirrels, snakes, lizards,\" &c. He tells him\r\nthat his room sometimes reminded him of Noah's ark, and comically adds,\r\n\"but Noah had a wife in one corner of it, and in this particular our\r\nparallel does not altogether tally. I receive every subject of natural\r\nhistory that is brought to me; and, though they do not march into my ark\r\nfrom all quarters, as they did into that of our great ancestor, yet I\r\nfind means, by the distribution of a few fivepenny _bits_, to make them\r\nfind the way fast enough. A boy, not long ago, brought me a large\r\nbasketful of crows. I expect his next load will be bull-frogs, if I\r\ndon't soon issue orders to the contrary. One of my boys caught a mouse\r\nin school a few days ago, and directly marched up to me with his\r\nprisoner. I set about drawing it the same evening, and all the while the\r\npantings of its little heart showed it to be in the most extreme agonies\r\nof fear. I had intended to kill it, in order to fix it in the claws of a\r\nstuffed owl; but, happening to spill a few drops of water near where it\r\nwas tied, it lapped it up with such eagerness, and looked in my face\r\nwith such an eye of supplicating terror, as perfectly overcame me. I\r\nimmediately restored it to life and liberty. The agonies of a prisoner\r\nat the stake, while the fire and instruments of torture are preparing,\r\ncould not be more severe than the sufferings of that poor mouse; and,\r\ninsignificant as the object was, I felt at that moment the sweet\r\nsensation that mercy leaves in the mind when she triumphs over\r\ncruelty.\"[174]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[163] \"The Life of General Sir Howard Douglas, Bart., G.C.B., F.R.S.,\r\nD.C.L., from his Notes, Conversations, and Correspondence,\" by S.

But the poet Cowper\r\nhas made the hare's history peculiarly pleasing and familiar. How often\r\nin his letters he alludes to his hares! Mrs E. B. Browning, in her\r\nexquisitely delicate and pathetic poem, \"Cowper's Grave,\" thus alludes\r\nto Cowper's pets--\r\n\r\n   \"Wild, timid hares were drawn from woods to share his home caresses,\r\n   Uplooking to his human eyes with sylvan tendernesses;\r\n   The very world, by God's constraint, from falsehood's ways removing,\r\n   Its women and its men became, beside him, true and loving.\"\r\n\r\nNot many years ago the compiler saw traces of the holes the poet had cut\r\nin the skirting-boards of the room for their ingress and egress, that\r\nthey might have ampler room for wandering. His epitaphs on two of them\r\nare often quoted. Rabbits are peculiarly the pets of boys, and though,\r\nwhen wild, often great vermin, from their destructive habits and their\r\nmining operations, are yet said to contribute much to the revenue of one\r\nEuropean monarch.\r\n\r\nHow Mr Malthus ought to have hated guinea-pigs, those fertile little\r\nlumps of blotched fur! Few creatures can be more productive.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COWPER ON HIS HARES.\r\n\r\nWhat a model description of the habits of an animal we have in the\r\ngentle Cowper's account of his hares! Would that he had made pets of\r\nother animals, and written descriptions of them, like that which\r\nfollows, and which is here copied from the original place to which he\r\ncontributed it.[175]\r\n\r\n                                                            \"_May_ 28.\r\n\r\n\"MR URBAN,--Convinced that you despise no communications that may\r\ngratify curiosity, amuse rationally, or add, though but a little, to the\r\nstock of public knowledge, I send you a circumstantial account of an\r\nanimal, which, though its general properties are pretty well known, is\r\nfor the most part such a stranger to man, that we are but little aware\r\nof its peculiarities. We know indeed that the hare is good to hunt and\r\ngood to eat; but in all other respects poor Puss is a neglected subject.\r\nIn the year 1774, being much indisposed, both in mind and body,\r\nincapable of diverting myself either with company or books, and yet in\r\na condition that made some diversion necessary, I was glad of anything\r\nthat would engage my attention without fatiguing it. The children of a\r\nneighbour of mine had a leveret given them for a plaything; it was at\r\nthat time about three months old. Understanding better how to tease the\r\npoor creature than to feed it, and soon becoming weary of their charge,\r\nthey readily consented that their father, who saw it pining and growing\r\nleaner every day, should offer it to my acceptance. I was willing enough\r\nto take the prisoner under my protection, perceiving that in the\r\nmanagement of such an animal, and in the attempt to tame it, I should\r\nfind just that sort of employment which my case required. It was soon\r\nknown among the neighbours that I was pleased with the present; and the\r\nconsequence was, that in a short time, I had as many leverets offered to\r\nme as would have stocked a paddock. I undertook the care of three, which\r\nit is necessary that I should here distinguish by the names I gave\r\nthem--Puss, Tiney, and Bess. Notwithstanding the two feminine\r\nappellatives, I must inform you that they were all males. Immediately\r\ncommencing carpenter, I built them houses to sleep in. Each had a\r\nseparate apartment, so contrived that their ordure would pass through\r\nthe bottom of it; an earthen pan placed under each received whatsoever\r\nfell, which being duly emptied and washed, they were thus kept perfectly\r\nsweet and clean. In the daytime they had the range of a hall, and at\r\nnight retired each to his own bed, never intruding into that of another.\r\n\r\n\"Puss grew presently familiar, would leap into my lap, raise himself\r\nupon his hinder feet, and bite the hair from my temples. He would suffer\r\nme to take him up, and to carry him about in my arms, and has more than\r\nonce fallen fast asleep upon my knee. He was ill three days, during\r\nwhich time I nursed him, kept him apart from his fellows that they might\r\nnot molest him (for, like many other wild animals, they persecute one of\r\ntheir own species that is sick), and by constant care, and trying him\r\nwith a variety of herbs, restored him to perfect health. No creature\r\ncould be more grateful than my patient after his recovery,--a sentiment\r\nwhich he most significantly expressed by licking my hand, first the back\r\nof it, then the palm, then every finger separately; then between all the\r\nfingers, as if anxious to leave no part of it unsaluted,--a ceremony\r\nwhich he never performed but once again upon a similar occasion. Finding\r\nhim extremely tractable, I made it my custom to carry him always after\r\nbreakfast into the garden, where he hid himself generally under the\r\nleaves of a cucumber vine, sleeping or chewing the cud till evening; in\r\nthe leaves also of that vine he found a favourite repast. I had not long\r\nhabituated him to this taste of liberty, before he began to be impatient\r\nfor the return of the time when he might enjoy it. He would invite me to\r\nthe garden by drumming upon my knee, and by a look of such expression as\r\nit was not possible to misinterpret. If this rhetoric did not\r\nimmediately succeed, he would take the skirt of my coat between his\r\nteeth, and pull at it with all his force. Thus Puss might be said to be\r\nperfectly tamed; the shyness of his nature was done away, and on the\r\nwhole it was visible, by many symptoms which I have not room to\r\nenumerate, that he was happier in human society than when shut up with\r\nhis natural companions.\r\n\r\n\"Not so Tiney. Upon him the kindest treatment had not the least effect.\r\nHe, too, was sick, and in his sickness, had an equal share of my\r\nattention; but if, after his recovery, I took the liberty to stroke him,\r\nhe would grunt, strike with his fore-feet, spring forward, and bite. He\r\nwas, however, very entertaining in his way, even his surliness was\r\nmatter of mirth, and in his play he preserved such an air of gravity,\r\nand performed his feats with such a solemnity of manner, that in him,\r\ntoo, I had an agreeable companion.\r\n\r\n\"Bess, who died soon after he was full grown, and whose death was\r\noccasioned by his being turned into his box, which had been washed,\r\nwhile it was yet damp, was a hare of great humour and drollery. Puss was\r\ntamed by gentle usage; Tiney was not to be tamed at all; and Bess had a\r\ncourage and confidence that made him tame from the beginning. I always\r\nadmitted them into the parlour after supper, where the carpet affording\r\ntheir feet a firm hold, they would frisk, and bound, and play a thousand\r\ngambols, in which Bess, being remarkably strong and fearless, was always\r\nsuperior to the rest, and proved himself the Vestris of the party. One\r\nevening, the cat, being in the room, had the hardiness to pat Bess upon\r\nthe cheek, an indignity which he resented by drumming upon her back with\r\nsuch violence, that the cat was happy to escape from under his paws and\r\nhide herself.\r\n\r\n\"You observe, sir, that I describe these animals as having each a\r\ncharacter of his own. Such they were in fact, and their countenances\r\nwere so expressive of that character, that, when I looked only on the\r\nface of either, I immediately knew which it was. It is said that a\r\nshepherd, however numerous his flock, soon becomes so familiar with\r\ntheir features, that he can by that indication only distinguish each\r\nfrom all the rest, and yet to a common observer the difference is hardly\r\nperceptible. I doubt not that the same discrimination in the cast of\r\ncountenances would be discoverable in hares, and am persuaded that among\r\na thousand of them no two could be found exactly similar; a circumstance\r\nlittle suspected by those who have not had opportunity to observe it.\r\nThese creatures have a singular sagacity in discovering the minutest\r\nalteration that is made in the place to which they are accustomed, and\r\ninstantly apply their nose to the examination of a new object. A small\r\nhole being burnt in the carpet, it was mended with a patch, and that\r\npatch in a moment underwent the strictest scrutiny. They seem, too, to\r\nbe very much directed by the smell in the choice of their favourites; to\r\nsome persons, though they saw them daily, they could never be\r\nreconciled, and would even scream when they attempted to touch them; but\r\na miller coming in, engaged their affections at once--his powdered coat\r\nhad charms that were irresistible. You will not wonder, sir, that my\r\nintimate acquaintance with these specimens of the kind has taught me to\r\nhold the sportsman's amusement in abhorrence. He little knows what\r\namiable creatures he persecutes, of what gratitude they are capable, how\r\ncheerful they are in their spirits, what enjoyment they have of life,\r\nand that, impressed as they seem with a peculiar dread of man, it is\r\nonly because man gives them peculiar cause for it.\r\n\r\n\"That I may not be tedious, I will just give you a short summary of\r\nthose articles of diet that suit them best, and then retire to make\r\nroom for some more important correspondent.\r\n\r\n\"I take it to be a general opinion that they graze, but it is an\r\nerroneous one, at least grass is not their staple; they seem rather to\r\nuse it medicinally, soon quitting it for leaves of almost any kind.\r\nSowthistle, dent-de-lion, and lettuce are their favourite vegetables,\r\nespecially the last. I discovered, by accident, that fine white sand is\r\nin great estimation with them, I suppose as a digestive. It happened\r\nthat I was cleaning a bird cage while the hares were with me; I placed a\r\npot filled with such sand upon the floor, to which being at once\r\ndirected by a strong instinct, they devoured it voraciously; since that\r\ntime I have generally taken care to see them well supplied with it. They\r\naccount green corn a delicacy, both blade and stalk, but the ear they\r\nseldom eat; straw of any kind, especially wheat-straw, is another of\r\ntheir dainties; they will feed greedily upon oats, but if furnished with\r\nclean straw, never want them; it serves them also for a bed, and, if\r\nshaken up daily, will be kept sweet and dry for a considerable time.\r\nThey do not indeed require aromatic herbs, but will eat a small quantity\r\nof them with great relish, and are particularly fond of the plant called\r\nmusk; they seem to resemble sheep in this, that if their pastures be too\r\nsucculent, they are very subject to the rot; to prevent which, I always\r\nmade bread their principal nourishment; and, filling a pan with it cut\r\ninto small squares, placed it every evening in their chambers, for they\r\nfeed only at evening and in the night; during the winter, when\r\nvegetables are not to be got, I mingled this mess of bread with shreds\r\nof carrot, adding to it the rind of apples cut extremely thin; for,\r\nthough they are fond of the paring, the apple itself disgusts them.\r\nThese, however, not being a sufficient substitute for the juice of\r\nsummer herbs, they must at this time be supplied with water; but so\r\nplaced that they cannot overset it into their beds. I must not omit,\r\nthat occasionally they are much pleased with twigs of hawthorn and of\r\nthe common briar, eating even the very wood when it is of considerable\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n\"Bess, I have said, died young; Tiney lived to be nine years old, and\r\ndied at last, I have reason to think, of some hurt in his loins by a\r\nfall. Puss is still living, and has just completed his tenth year,\r\ndiscovering no signs of decay nor even of age, except that he is grown\r\nmore discreet and less frolicsome than he was. I cannot conclude, sir,\r\nwithout informing you that I have lately introduced a dog to his\r\nacquaintance, a spaniel that had never seen a hare, to a hare that had\r\nnever seen a spaniel. I did it with great caution, but there was no real\r\nneed of it. Puss discovered no token of fear, nor Marquis the least\r\nsymptom of hostility. There is, therefore, it should seem, no natural\r\nantipathy between dog and hare, but the pursuit of the one occasions the\r\nflight of the other, and the dog pursues because he is trained to it;\r\nthey eat bread at the same time out of the same hand, and are in all\r\nrespects sociable and friendly.--Yours &c.,\r\n\r\n                                                                 W. C.\r\n\r\n\"_P.S._--I should not do complete justice to my subject, did I not add,\r\nthat they have no ill scent belonging to them, that they are\r\nindefatigably nice in keeping themselves clean, for which purpose nature\r\nhas furnished them with a brush under each foot; and that they are never\r\ninfested by any vermin.\"\r\n\r\nOur readers know his fine verses or epitaphs on his hares. We may quote\r\nfrom the biographer to whom Sir Robert Peel and the Duke of Wellington\r\nleft all their papers and memoirs, a sentence or two on Cowper's hares,\r\nand on the other pets of that lovable man. Earl Stanhope[176] says of\r\nthis poet and \"best letter-writer in the English language--\"Such,\r\nindeed, were his powers of description and felicity of language, that\r\neven the most trivial objects drew life and colour from his touch. In\r\nhis pages, the training of three tame hares, or the building of a frame\r\nfor cucumbers, excite a warmer interest than many accounts compiled by\r\nother writers, of great battles deciding the fate of empires. In his\r\npages, the sluggish waters of the Ouse,--the floating lilies which he\r\nstooped to gather from them,--the poplars, in whose shade he sat, and\r\nover whose fall he mourned, rise before us as though we had known and\r\nloved them too. As Cowper himself declares, 'My descriptions are all\r\nfrom nature, not one of them second-handed; my delineations of the heart\r\nare from my own experience, not one of them borrowed from books.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHAIRS OR HARES!\r\n\r\nA gentleman on circuit, narrating to Lord Norbury some extravagant feat\r\nin sporting, mentioned that he had lately shot thirty-three hares before\r\nbreakfast. \"Thirty-three _hairs_!\" exclaimed Lord Norbury; \"zounds, sir!\r\nthen you must have been firing at a _wig_.\"[177]\r\n\r\nSportsmen are very apt to exaggerate. They did so at least in Horace's\r\ndays. We have heard of a man of rank, who actually made a gamekeeper,\r\nwho was a first-rate marksman, fire whenever he discharged his piece.\r\nThe story goes, that _that_ man was regarded as having shot everything\r\nthat fell.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of L.'s reply, when it was observed to him that the gentlemen\r\nbordering on his estates were continually hunting upon them, and that he\r\nought not to suffer it, is worthy of imitation. \"I had much rather,\"\r\nsaid he, \"have _friends_ than hares.\"[178]\r\n\r\nThe time must be coming, when every farmer or peasant will be allowed to\r\nshoot hares. It is surely cruel to imprison or fine a man for shooting\r\nand shouldering a hare. Having lately traversed a goodly part of the\r\nPerthshire Highlands, we were struck with the numbers of Arctic hares\r\nthat scudded away out of our path. What a fine help one of them would be\r\nto a poor family.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. BISSET AND HIS TRAINED HARE AND TURTLE.\r\n\r\nS. Bisset, whose training of other animals is elsewhere recorded, like\r\nthe poet Cowper, procured a leveret, and reared it to beat several\r\nmarches on the drum with its hind legs, until it became a good stout\r\nhare. This creature, which is always set down as the most timid, he\r\ndeclared to be as mischievous and bold an animal, to the extent of its\r\npower, as any with which he was acquainted. He taught canary-birds,\r\nlinnets, and sparrows, to spell the name of any person in company, to\r\ndistinguish the hour and minute of time, and play many other surprising\r\ntricks. He trained six turkey-cocks to go through a regular country\r\ndance; but in doing this he confessed he adopted the eastern method, by\r\nwhich camels are made to dance, by heating the floor. In the course of\r\nsix months' teaching, he made a turtle fetch and carry like a dog; and\r\nhaving chalked the floor, and blackened its claws, could direct it to\r\ntrace out any given name of the company.[179]\r\n\r\n\r\nA FAMILY OF RABBITS ALL BLIND OF ONE EYE.\r\n\r\nLady Anne Barnard, in her Cape Journal,[180] referring to Dessin or\r\nRabbit Island at the Cape of Good Hope, says that it is \"dreadfully\r\nexposed to the south-east winds. A gentleman told me of a natural\r\nphenomenon he had met with when shooting there; his dog pointed at a\r\nrabbit's hole, where the company within were placed so near the opening\r\nthat he could see Mynheer, Madame, and the whole rabbit family. Pompey,\r\nencouraged, brought out the old coney, his wife, and seven young\r\nones,--all, like the callenders in the 'Arabian Nights' Entertainments,'\r\nblind of one eye, and that the same eye. The question was, on which side\r\nof the island was the rabbit's hole? With a very little reasoning and\r\ncomparing, it was found that from its position, the keen blast must have\r\nproduced this effect. The oddest part of this story is, that it is true,\r\nbut I do not expect you to believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS FULLER ON NORFOLK RABBITS.\r\n\r\n\"These are an army of natural pioneers whence men have learned\r\n_cuniculos agere_, the art of undermining. They thrive best on barren\r\nground, and grow fattest in the hardest frosts. Their flesh is fine and\r\nwholesome. If Scottish men tax our language as improper, and smile at\r\nour wing of a rabbit, let us laugh at their shoulder of a capon.\r\n\r\nTheir skins were formerly much used, when furs were in fashion; till of\r\nlate our citizens, of Romans are turned Grecians, have laid down their\r\ngrave gowns and taken up their light cloaks; men generally disliking all\r\nhabits, though emblems of honour, if also badges of age.\r\n\r\nTheir rich or silver-hair skins, formerly so dear, are now levelled in\r\nprices with other colours; yea, are lower than black in estimation,\r\nbecause their wool is most used in making of hats, commonly (for the\r\nmore credit) called half-beavers, though many of them hardly amount to\r\nthe proportion of semi-demi castors.\"[181]\r\n\r\n\r\nDR CHALMERS AND THE GUINEA-PIG.\r\n\r\nMr Aitken alludes in a pleasing manner to an instance of Dr Chalmers's\r\nfondness for animals. He had just been appointed the head-master of one\r\nof the Glasgow parish schools (St John's). \"Early in the week following\r\nmy appointment, I received my first private call. One circumstance\r\noccurred during the visit which I still remember most vividly. One of my\r\nchildren had been presented with a pair of guinea-pigs. These had found\r\ntheir way into the apartment where we were sitting, and ran about in all\r\ndirections. I could have wished to turn them out, but had not the power\r\nto rise from my chair. He soon observed them, followed them with his eye\r\nas they now retreated under his chair and again ventured out into his\r\npresence--he even changed the position of his feet to give them scope.\r\nThat same kindly eye, one glance of which we all loved so much to catch\r\nin after-life, beamed only the more warmly as the creatures frisked in\r\ngreater confidence around him. It was to me an omen for good. He who\r\ncould enjoy thus the innocent gamble of these guinea-pigs could not fail\r\nto be accessible for good when occasion required. It was the first flush\r\nof that largeness of heart which afterwards appeared in all I ever heard\r\nhim say or saw him do.\"[182]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[174] \"Memoir of Wilson,\" p. 27, prefixed to his poetical works.\r\nBelfast, 1844.\r\n\r\n[175] _Gentleman's Magazine_, for June 1784, being the sixth number of\r\nvol. liv., pp. 412-414, \"Unnoticed Properties of that little animal the\r\nHare.\"\r\n\r\n[176] \"History of England,\" vol. vi. p. 486.\r\n\r\n[177] Mark Lemon, \"Jest Book,\" p. 59.\r\n\r\n[178] Mark Lemon, \"Jest Book,\" p. 182.\r\n\r\n[179] Biography of S.

The following bit is\r\npeculiarly happy: \"The sloth, in its wild state, spends its life in\r\ntrees, and never leaves them but from force or accident. The eagle to\r\nthe sky, the mole to the ground, the sloth to the tree; but what is most\r\nextraordinary, he lives not _upon_ the branches, but _under_ them. He\r\nmoves suspended, rests suspended, sleeps suspended, and passes his\r\nlife in suspense--like a young clergyman distantly related to a\r\nbishop.\"[183]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Great Ant-Eater. (Myrmecophaga jabata).]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[182] Dr Hannah's \"Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Thomas Chalmers,\r\nD.D., L.L.D.,\" vol. ii. p. 237.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ANT-EATER.\r\n\r\n(_Myrmecophaga jubata_, L.[184])\r\n\r\n\r\nA few months ago a handbill was distributed in the neighbourhood of\r\nSeven Dials, inviting the public to visit a \"wonderful animal fed with\r\nants, and possessing strength to kill the lion, tiger, or any other\r\nanimal under its claws.\" We entered the miserable apartment where it was\r\nexhibited, and any spectator must at once have been struck with the\r\ncreature's want of resemblance to any other he had ever seen. Its head\r\nso small, so long and slender; the straight, wiry, dry hair with which\r\nit was covered, and its singularly large and bushy tail, first attracted\r\nnotice. A second glance showed its enormously thick fore-legs, and the\r\nclaws of its feet turned in, so that it walked on the sides of its\r\nsoles. Oken and St Hilaire would have said that it was \"all extremity.\"\r\nA cup, with the contents of one or two eggs, was brought, and it sucked\r\nthem with great avidity, every now and then darting from its small mouth\r\na very long tongue, which looked like a great, black worm, whisking\r\nabout in the custard. One of its showmen told us that it had attacked\r\nthe woman of the house the preceding day, and had scratched her arm.\r\nWhether this was true or grossly exaggerated, we know not; but if so, we\r\nsuspect that the woman herself must have been in fault, and not the\r\ninoffensive stranger.\r\n\r\nOn the payment of a handsome consideration to her owners, the poor\r\ncaptive was transferred from her unwholesome lodging in St Giles's, to\r\nthe Gardens of the Zoological Society in the Regent's Park. And within\r\nthe last few weeks her solitude has been cheered by the arrival of a\r\ncompanion from her native forests. The new-comer is in beautiful\r\ncondition, though not nearly so large. He has a head decidedly shorter\r\nand stronger, and is probably not yet fully grown.\r\n\r\nThe great ant-eater seems to be scattered over a wide extent of South\r\nAmerica--Guiana, Brazil, and Paraguay, being its places of abode. It is\r\na stout animal, measuring from the end of the snout to the tip of the\r\nlong tail six or seven feet, of which the tail takes nearly the half; so\r\nthat the actual size of its body is much reduced. In Paraguay it is\r\nnamed _Nurumi_ or _Yogui_. The former name is altered from the native\r\nword for _small mouth_, and indicates a striking peculiarity in its\r\nstructure. The Portuguese call it _Tamandua_; the Spaniards, _Osa\r\nhormiguero_ (_i.e._, ant-hill bear). In Paraguay it prefers sides of\r\nlakes where ants, at least termites or white ants, are abundant; but it\r\nalso frequents woods. In Guiana, Mr Waterton found it chiefly \"in the\r\ninmost recesses of the forest,\" where it \"seems partial to the low and\r\nswampy parts near creeks, where the troely tree grows.\"[185] It sleeps a\r\ngreat deal, reclining on its side, as the visitor to the Gardens may\r\nfrequently see it do, with its head between its fore-legs, joining its\r\nfore and hindfeet, and spreading the tail so as to cover the whole\r\nbody. Huddled up under this thatch, it might almost be taken for a\r\nbundle of coarse and badly dried hay. The tail is thickly covered with\r\nlong hairs, placed vertically, the hairs draggling on the ground. When\r\nthe creature is irritated, the tail is shaken straight and elevated. The\r\nnatives of Paraguay, like other persecutors of harmlessness, kill every\r\nspecimen they meet, so that the ant-eater gets rare, and so rare is it\r\non the Amazon that Mr Wallace, who travelled there from 1848 to 1852,\r\nhonestly tells us he never saw one. He heard, however, that during rain\r\nit turns its bushy tail over its head and stands still. The Indians,\r\nknowing this habit, when they meet an ant-eater, make a rustling noise\r\namong the leaves. The creature instantly turns up its tail, and is\r\neasily killed by the stroke of a stick on its little head.[186]\r\n\r\nThe ant-eater is slow in its movements--never attempting to escape. When\r\nhard pressed it stops, and, seated on its hind-legs, waits for the\r\naggressor. Its object is to receive him between its fore-legs; and one\r\nhas only to look at its arms and claws in order to fancy what a\r\nfrightful squeeze it would give. Nothing but death, they say, will make\r\nthe creature relax its grasp. It is asserted that the jaguar--the tiger\r\nof South America, and the most formidable beast of the New World--dares\r\nnot attack it. This Azara, with good reason, doubts. A single bite from\r\na jaguar, or the stroke of his paw, would fracture an ant-eater's skull\r\nbefore it had time to turn round; for the movements of this edentate\r\nquadruped are as sluggish as those of the toothed carnivorous tyrant are\r\nrapid.\r\n\r\nAs seen in its handsome and roomy cage, the ant-eater gives us an\r\nimpression of dulness and stupidity; and always smelling and listening\r\nand looking at the door where its keeper introduces its food, its mind,\r\nwhen awake, appears to be constantly occupied about \"creature comforts.\"\r\nIn the course of the day it laps up with its darting tongue, and sucks\r\nin through its long taper snout a dozen eggs, and almost the whole of a\r\nrabbit, chopped into a fine mince-meat. With such dainty fare, and with\r\nthe anxious attention which it receives from its sagacious curators, it\r\nis scarcely surprising that it thrives; and when the warm weather comes,\r\nit will be a fine sight to see these animals enjoying the range of a\r\npaddock, which will doubtless be provided for their use, and exercising\r\ntheir brawny forelimbs and powerful claws in pulling down conical\r\nmounds, which may remind them of departed joys and balmier climes. Nor\r\nwill it be the least charm of the spectacle that it will enable us to\r\ncompare this living species with other _Edentata_ of South America--such\r\nas the Megatherium, now only found in the fossil state, but so admirably\r\nrestored by Mr Hawkins for the Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nWe need not dwell on the admirable adaptation of the ant-eater to its\r\nposition and to its few and simple wants. To those who have not studied\r\n\"the works of the Lord,\" it may appear uncouth and unattractive.\r\nCompared with a dog, it is stupid; and alongside of a lion, it is slow.\r\nIt has not the symmetry of the horse, nor the beautiful markings of the\r\nzebra and leopard. But its Creator has given it the instincts, the form,\r\nthe muscular powers, and the colours which best answer its purpose. And\r\nno one can say that it is plain and ugly, who looks at its legs so\r\nprettily variegated with white and black, and its noble black collar.\r\n\r\nThose of our readers who wish further information will find it in the\r\n_Literary Gazette_ for October 8, 1853. In that article it is easy to\r\nrecognise the Roman hand of the _facile princeps_ among living\r\ncomparative anatomists. Long may it be before either of our new\r\nacquaintances in the Garden afford him a subject for dissection; but\r\nwhen that day arrives, we hope that he will not delay to publish the\r\nmemoir.[187]--_A.

How the great\r\nthick-skinned creature enjoys a bath!\r\n\r\nAs for the elephant, he is a mountain of matter as well as of animal\r\nintelligence. Sir Emerson Tennant in his \"Ceylon,\" but especially in his\r\n\"Natural History,\" volumes, has given some truly readable chapters on\r\nthe Asiatic elephant. We could have extracted many an anecdote, even\r\nfrom recent works, of the intelligent sagacity of the Indian as well as\r\nthe African elephants. The account of the shooting of Mr Cross's\r\nwell-known elephant _Chunie_, at Exeter Change, has been very curiously\r\nand fully detailed by Hone in his \"Every-Day Book.\" A skull of an\r\nelephant in the British Museum, shows how wonderfully an elephant is at\r\ntimes able to defend itself from attack. Many a shot that \"rogue\r\nelephant\" had received, years before the three or four Indian sportsmen,\r\nwho presented its skull as a trophy, succeeded in planting a shot in its\r\nbrain, or in its heart. Think of the feelings of Lord Clive's relations,\r\nat the prospect of his sending home an elephant for a pet. The good\r\nfolks, not without some motive, as the great Indian ruler conceived,\r\nother than mere love for him, had been sending him presents. Samuel\r\nRogers, who wrote the neatest of hands, records that Clive wrote the\r\nworst and certainly the most illegible of scrawls. Instead of\r\n\"elephant,\" as they read it, their liberal relative had written\r\n\"equivalent!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LORD KEEPER GUILFORD AND HIS VISIT TO THE RHINOCEROS IN THE CITY OF\r\nLONDON.[188]\r\n\r\nIt is strange to read in the life of the Lord Keeper Guilford, that his\r\nlordship's court enemies, \"hard put to it to find, or invent, something\r\ntending to the diminution of his character,\" took advantage of his going\r\nto see a rhinoceros, to circulate a foolish story of him, which much\r\nannoyed him. It was in the reign of James II. his biographer thus\r\nrecords it. The rhinoceros, referred to, was the first ever brought to\r\nEngland. Evelyn, in his \"Memoirs,\" says, that it was sold for £2000, a\r\nmost enormous sum in those days (1685).\r\n\r\nRoger North relates the story:--\"It fell out thus--a merchant of Sir\r\nDudley North's acquaintance had brought over an enormous rhinoceros, to\r\nbe sold to showmen for profit. It is a noble beast, wonderfully armed by\r\nnature for offence, but more for defence, being covered with\r\nimpenetrable shields, which no weapon would make any impression upon,\r\nand a rarity so great that few men, in our country, have in their whole\r\nlives the opportunity of seeing so singular an animal. This merchant\r\ntold Sir Dudley North that if he, with a friend or two, had a mind to\r\nsee it, they might take the opportunity at his house before it was sold.\r\nHereupon Sir Dudley North proposed to his brother, the Lord Keeper, to\r\ngo with him upon this exhibition, which he did, and came away\r\nexceedingly satisfied with the curiosity he had seen. But whether he was\r\ndogged to find out where he and his brother housed in the city, or\r\nflying fame carried an account of the voyage to court, I know not; but\r\nit is certain that the very next morning a bruit went from thence all\r\nover the town, and (as factious reports used to run) in a very short\r\ntime, viz., that his lordship rode upon the rhinoceros, than which a\r\nmore infantine exploit could not have been fastened upon him. And most\r\npeople were struck with amazement at it, and divers ran here and there\r\nto find out whether it was true or no. And soon after dinner some lords\r\nand others came to his lordship to know the truth from himself, for the\r\nsetters of the lie affirmed it positively as of their own knowledge.\r\nThat did not give his lordship much disturbance, for he expected no\r\nbetter from his adversaries. But that his friends, intelligent persons,\r\nwho must know him to be far from guilty of any childish levity, should\r\nbelieve it, was what roiled him extremely, and much more when they had\r\nthe face to come to him to know if it were true. I never saw him in such\r\na rage, and to lay about him with affronts (which he keenly bestowed\r\nupon the minor courtiers that came on that errand) as then; for he sent\r\nthem away with fleas in their ear. And he was seriously angry with his\r\nown brother, Sir Dudley North, because he did not contradict the lie in\r\nsudden and direct terms, but laughed as taking the question put to him\r\nfor a banter, till, by iteration, he was brought to it. For some lords\r\ncame, and because they seemed to attribute somewhat to the avowed\r\npositiveness of the reporters, he rather chose to send for his brother\r\nto attest than to impose his bare denial, and so it passed; and the\r\nnoble earl (of Sunderland), with Jeffries, and others of that crew, made\r\nmerry, and never blushed at the lie of their own making, but valued\r\nthemselves upon it as a very good jest.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it passed. What a sensation would have been caused by the sudden\r\napparition in that age of a few numbers of _Punch_. What a subject for a\r\ncartoon, some John Leech of 1685 would have made of the stately Lord\r\nKeeper on the back of a rhinoceros, and the infamous Judge Jeffries\r\nleering at him from a window.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT AND HIS TRUNK.\r\n\r\nCanning and another gentleman were looking at a picture of the deluge;\r\nthe ark was seen in the middle distance, while in the fore-sea an\r\nelephant was struggling with his fate. \"I wonder,\" said the gentleman,\r\n\"that the elephant did not secure _an inside_ place!\"--\"He was too late,\r\nmy friend,\" replied Canning; \"he was detained _packing up his\r\ntrunk_.\"[189]\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR RICHARD PHILLIPS AND JELLY MADE OF IVORY DUST.--A VEGETARIAN TAKEN\r\nIN.\r\n\r\nThe biographers of James Montgomery[190] relate an amusing anecdote of\r\nSir Richard Phillips, the eccentric London bookseller and author. He\r\nvisited Sheffield in October 1828. \"He had lived too long amidst the\r\nbustle and business of the great world, and was too little conscious of\r\nany feeling at all like diffidence, to allow him to hesitate about\r\ncalling upon any person, whether of rank, genius, or eccentricity, when\r\nthe success of his project was likely to be thereby promoted. The time\r\nselected by the free and easy knight for his unannounced visitation of\r\nMontgomery was _Sunday at dinner time_. He was at once asked to sit down\r\nand partake of the chickens and bacon which had just been placed on the\r\ntable, but here was a dilemma; Sir Richard, although neither a Brahmin\r\nnor a Jew, avowed himself a staunch Pythagorean--he could eat no flesh!\r\nLuckily there was a plentiful supply of carrots and turnips, and--jelly.\r\nBut was the latter made from calves' feet? Montgomery assured his guest\r\nthat it was _not_; but, added he, with a conscientious regard for his\r\nvisitor's scruples, from _ivory dust_. We believe the poet fancied the\r\nhypothesis of an animal origin of this viand could not be very obscure;\r\nit was, however, swallowed; the clever bibliopole perhaps believing,\r\nwith some of the Sheffield ivory-cutters, that elephants, instead of\r\nbeing hunted and killed for their tusks, _shed them_ when fully grown,\r\nas bucks do their antlers!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. T. SMITH AND THE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\nThat gossiping man, J. T. Smith, once Keeper of the Prints in the\r\nBritish Museum, and author of \"Nollekens and his Times,\" relates, that\r\nwhen he and a friend were returning late from a club, and were\r\napproaching Temple Bar, \"about one o'clock, a most unaccountable\r\nappearance claimed our attention,--it was no less than an elephant,\r\nwhose keepers were coaxing it to pass through the gateway. He had been\r\naccompanied with several persons from the Tower wharf with tall poles,\r\nbut was principally guided by two men with ropes, each walking on either\r\nside of the street, to keep him as much as possible in the middle, on\r\nhis way to the menagerie, Exeter Change, to which destination, after\r\npassing St Clement's Church, he steadily trudged on, with strict\r\nobedience to the command of his keepers.[191]\r\n\r\n\"I had the honour afterwards of partaking of a pot of Barclay's entire\r\nwith this same elephant, which high mark of his condescension was\r\nbestowed when I accompanied my friend, the late Sir James Wintel Lake,\r\nBart., to view the rare animals in Exeter Change,--that gentleman being\r\nassured by the elephant's keeper that, if he would offer the beast a\r\nshilling, he would see the noble animal nod his head and drink a pot of\r\nporter. The elephant had no sooner taken the shilling, which he did in\r\nthe mildest manner from the palm of Sir James's hand, than he gave it to\r\nthe keeper, and eagerly watched his return with the beer. The elephant\r\nthen, after placing his proboscis to the top of the tankard, drew up\r\nnearly the whole of the beverage. The keeper observed, 'You will hardly\r\nbelieve, gentlemen, but the little he has left is quite warm;' upon this\r\nwe were tempted to taste it, and it really was so. This animal was\r\nafterwards disposed of for the sum of one thousand guineas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT AND THE TAILOR.\r\n\r\nThis old story has been often told, but never so well as by Sydney Smith\r\nin one of his lectures at the Royal Institution. \"Every one knows the\r\nold story of the tailor and the elephant, which, if it be not true, at\r\nleast shows the opinion the Orientals, who know the animal well,\r\nentertain of his sagacity. An eastern tailor to the Court was making a\r\nmagnificent doublet for a bashaw of nine tails, and covering it, after\r\nthe manner of eastern doublets, with gold, silver, and every species of\r\nmetallic magnificence. As he was busying himself on this momentous\r\noccasion, there passed by, to the pools of water, one of the royal\r\nelephants, about the size of a broad-wheeled waggon, rich in ivory\r\nteeth, and shaking, with its ponderous tread, the tailor's shop to its\r\nremotest thimble. As he passed near the window, the elephant happened to\r\nlook in; the tailor lifted up his eyes, perceived the proboscis of the\r\nelephant near him, and, being seized with a fit of facetiousness,\r\npricked the animal with his needle; the mass of matter immediately\r\nretired, stalked away to the pool, filled his trunk full of muddy water,\r\nand, returning to the shop, overwhelmed the artisan and his doublet with\r\nthe dirty effects of his vengeance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDR JOHNSON ALLUDED TO AS \"AN ELEPHANT.\"\r\n\r\n\"If an elephant could write a book, perhaps one that had read a great\r\ndeal would say, that an Arabian horse is a very clumsy, ungraceful\r\nanimal.\" This was written by Horace Walpole to Miss Berry, in 1791, in\r\nallusion to Dr Johnson's depreciation of Thomas Gray the poet.[192] It\r\nis an acute observation, well worth being wrought out. There is a\r\ngrandeur and even a grace about this bulky beast and its motions well\r\ndeserving the study of any one who has the opportunity. Elephants in our\r\nstreets are not now so rare as they used to be. We saw three in one\r\nprocession in the streets of Edinburgh in 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nELEPHANT'S SKIN.\r\n\r\n\"Did any of you ever see an elephant's skin?\" asked the master of an\r\ninfant school in a fast neighbourhood. \"I have!\" shouted a six-year-old\r\nat the foot of the class. \"Where?\" inquired the master, amused by his\r\nearnestness. \"_On the elephant!_\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[187] This memoir has been published, and the subject of it was this\r\nvery ant-eater.

He\r\nhas enabled the comparative anatomist to tell from a small portion of\r\nbone not only the class, but the order, genus, and even the species to\r\nwhich animal that bone belonged.\r\n\r\nMrs Lee,[193] in her Life of the Baron, gives an example of his\r\nenthusiasm in his researches.\r\n\r\nM. Laurillard was afterwards his secretary and the draftsman who\r\nexecuted nearly all the drawings in his \"Ossemens fossiles.\" At the time\r\nof this story he had not particularly attracted Cuvier's notice.\r\n\r\n\"One day Cuvier came to his brother Frederic to ask him to disengage a\r\nfossil from its surrounding mass, an office he had frequently performed.\r\nM. Laurillard was applied to in the absence of F. Cuvier. Little aware\r\nof the value of the specimen confided to his care, he cheerfully set to\r\nwork, and succeeded in getting the bone entire from its position. M.\r\nCuvier, after a short time, returned for his treasure, and when he saw\r\nhow perfect it was, his ecstasies became incontrollable; he danced, he\r\nshook his hands, he uttered expressions of delight, till M. Laurillard,\r\nin his ignorance both of the importance of what he had done, and of the\r\nardent character of M. Cuvier, thought he was mad. Taking, however, his\r\nfossil foot in one hand, and dragging Laurillard's arm with the other,\r\nhe led him up-stairs to present him to his wife and sister-in-law,\r\nsaying, 'I have got my foot, and M. Laurillard found it for me.' It\r\nseems that this skilful operation confirmed all M. Cuvier's previous\r\nconjecture concerning a foot, the existence and form of which he had\r\nalready guessed, but for which he had long and vainly sought. So\r\noccupied had he been by it, that, when he appeared to be particularly\r\nabsent, his family were wont to accuse him of seeking his fore-foot. The\r\nnext morning the able operator and draftsman was engaged as secretary.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[192] \"Letters of Horace Walpole,\" edited by Peter Cunningham, ix., 319.\r\n\r\n[193] \"Memoirs of Baron Cuvier,\" by Mrs R.

Dean Ramsay,\r\nin a happy anecdote, refers to a good quality of the sow as food. He\r\ntells, that a Scottish minister had been persuaded to keep a pig, and\r\nthat the good wife had been duly instructed in the mysteries of\r\nblack-puddings, pork-chops, pig's-head, and other modes of turning poor\r\npiggy to account. The minister remarked to a friend, \"Nae doubt there's\r\na hantle o' miscellaneous eating aboot a pig.\" The author of \"A Ramble,\"\r\npublished by Edmonstone and Douglas in 1865, has devoted some most\r\namusing pages of his work to an account of \"Pig-sticking in Chicago,\" as\r\nwitnessed by him during the late American war. The wholesale and\r\nscientific off-hand way in which living pigs enter into one part of a\r\nmachine, and come out prepared pork, could only have been devised by a\r\nYankee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Wild Boar of Syria and Egypt. (Sus Scrofa.)]\r\n\r\nThe essay of Charles Lamb on Roast Pig, and his history of how the\r\nChinaman discovered it, is a most characteristic bit of the productions\r\nof Elia. We have cut from a recent paper, what seems an authentic story,\r\nof one of this race having obtained a kind of mausoleum. We hope it is\r\nnot a hoax, but that it is as genuine as all that is in one of \"Murray's\r\nHandbooks:\"--\r\n\r\nMONUMENT TO A PIG.--\"Up to the present time,\" says the _Europe_ of\r\nFrankfort, \"no monument that we are aware of had ever been erected to\r\nthe memory of a _pig_. The town of Luneburg, in Hanover, has wished to\r\nfill up that blank; and at the Hotel de Ville, in that town, there is to\r\nbe seen a kind of mausoleum to the memory of a member of the swinish\r\nrace. In the interior of that commemorative structure is to be seen a\r\nglass case, inclosing a ham still in good preservation. A slab of black\r\nmarble attracts the eye of visitors, who find thereon the following\r\ninscription in Latin, engraved in letters of gold--'Passer-by,\r\ncontemplate here the mortal remains of the pig which acquired for itself\r\nimperishable glory by the discovery of the salt springs of Luneburg.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILD BOAR (_Sus scrofa_).\r\n\r\nWe have a specimen of the family of swine in that well-known and useful\r\nanimal, with whose portrait Sir Charles Bell furnishes the reader, as an\r\nexample of a head as remote as possible from the head of him who\r\ndesigned and executed the Elgin marbles. Although the learned anatomist\r\nbrought forward the profile of this animal as the type of a\r\n\"non-intellectual\" being, yet there are instances enough on record to\r\nshow that pigs are not devoid of intelligence, and are even, when\r\ntrained, capable of considerable docility. \"Learned pigs,\" however, such\r\nas are exhibited at country fairs, are a rare occurrence, and the family\r\nto which they belong is essentially one \"gross\" in character, and far\r\nfrom gainly in appearance. The most handsome of the race is one from\r\nWest Africa, recently added to the Zoological Gardens, and described by\r\nDr Gray under the name of _Potamochærus penicillatus_. The wild swine of\r\nAfrica are, with this bright exception, anything but handsome, either in\r\nshape or colour; and the large excrescences on their cheeks and face\r\ngive the \"warthogs\" a ferocious look, which corresponds with their\r\nhabits. In the East there are several species of wild swine. One of the\r\nmost celebrated is the _Babyrusa_ of the Malay peninsula, distinguished\r\nby its long recurved teeth, with which it was once fancied that they\r\nsuspended themselves from trees, or rather supported themselves when\r\nasleep. Mrs M'Dougall[194] refers to the wild hogs of Borneo, which seem\r\nto be dainty in their diet, as they think nothing of a swim of four\r\nmiles from their jungle home to places on the river where they know\r\nthere are trees laden with ripe fruit. These Borneo swine are active\r\ncreatures too, as they can leap fences nearly six feet high. In South\r\nAmerica the sow family is represented by the Peccaries (_Dicotyles_), of\r\nwhich there are two species, one of which is very abundant in the woods,\r\nand forms a most important article in the diet of the poor Indians.\r\nThey, too, can swim across rivers, and although their legs are short,\r\nthey can run very fast.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly in the warmer parts of the world that the species of this\r\nfamily are found. They are all distinguished by the middle toes of each\r\nfoot being larger than the others, and armed with hoofs,[195] the side\r\ntoe or toes being shorter, and scarcely reaching the ground. The nose\r\nterminates in a truncated, tough, grissly disk, which is singularly well\r\nadapted for the purpose of the animals, which all grub in the ground for\r\ntheir food. In some parts of France it is said that they are trained to\r\nsearch for truffles.\r\n\r\nHaving briefly alluded to different species \"_de grege porci_,\" we now\r\nlimit ourselves to our immediate subject.\r\n\r\nThe wild boar, at no very remote period, was found in the extensive\r\nwoods which covered great portions of this island. The family of Baird\r\nderives its heraldic crest of a wild boar's head from a grant of David\r\nI., King of Scotland. This monarch was hunting in Aberdeenshire, and\r\nwhen separated from his attendants, the infuriated pig turned upon him;\r\none of his people came up and killed it, and in memory of his feat\r\nreceived from the grateful king the device still borne by the family.\r\nThe name of a Scottish parish, and of one of the oldest baronial\r\nfamilies in Scotland--Swinton of Swinton, in Berwickshire--is derived\r\nalso from this animal, the first of the Swintons having cleared that\r\npart of the country from the wild swine which then infested it. It is\r\ncurious to know that some large fields in the neighbourhood of Swinton\r\nstill carry in their names traces of these early occupants. Dr Baird\r\ninformed the writer that there are four of these fields so\r\ndistinguished:--\"Sow-causeway,\" and \"Pikerigg,\" where the wild swine\r\nused to feed (\"pick their food\"); \"Stab's Cross,\" where Sir Alan Swinton\r\nwith his spear pierced some monarch of the race; and \"Alan's Cairn,\"\r\nwhere a heap of stones was raised as a monument of his hardihood. In the\r\nsouthern part of our island only the nobility and gentry were allowed to\r\nhunt this animal; and in the reign of William the Conqueror any one\r\nconvicted of killing a wild boar in any of the royal demesnes was\r\npunished with the loss of his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the Continent the wild boar is still far from rare, and\r\naffords, to those who are fond of excitement, that peculiar kind of\r\n\"pleasure\" which involves a certain amount of danger. Scenes somewhat\r\nsimilar to those depicted by Snyders may still be witnessed in some\r\nparts of Germany; and in the sketches of Mr Wolf, the able artist whose\r\ndesigns illustrate these papers, we have seen animated studies of this\r\ntruly hazardous sport.\r\n\r\nThe nose of the wild boar is very acute in the sense of smell. A zealous\r\nsportsman tells us, \"I have often been surprised, when stealing upon one\r\nin the woods, to observe how soon he has become aware of my\r\nneighbourhood. Lifting his head, he would sniff the air inquiringly,\r\nthen, uttering a short grunt, make off as fast as he could.\"[196] The\r\nsame writer has also sometimes noticed in a family of wild boars one,\r\ngenerally a weakling, who was buffeted and ill-treated by the rest. \"Do\r\nwhat he would, nothing was right; sometimes the mother, uttering a\r\ndisapproving grunt, would give him a nudge to make him move more\r\nquickly, and that would be a sign for all the rest of his relations to\r\nbegin showing their contempt for him too. One would push him, and then\r\nanother; for, go where he might, he was sure to be in the way.\" In the\r\nextensive woods frequented by this animal in Europe, abundant supplies\r\nof food are met with in the roots of various plants which it grubs up,\r\nin the beech-mast, acorns, and other tree productions, which, during two\r\nor three months of the year, it finds on the ground. Although well able\r\nto defend itself, it is a harmless animal, and being shy, retires to\r\nthose parts of the forests most remote from the presence of man. A site\r\nin the neighbourhood of water is preferred to any other.\r\n\r\nTravellers in the East frequently refer to this animal and to its\r\nravages when it gets into a rice-field or a vineyard; for although its\r\nnatural food be wild roots and wild fruits, if cultivated grounds be in\r\nthe neighbourhood, its ravages are very annoying to the husbandmen, who\r\ncan fully and feelingly understand the words of the Psalmist, \"The boar\r\nout of the wood doth waste it\" (Ps. lxxx. 13).\r\n\r\nMessrs Irby and Mangles,[197] as they approached the Jordan, saw a herd\r\nof nine wild pigs, and they found the trees on the banks of a stream\r\nnear that river all marked with mud, left by the wild swine in rubbing\r\nthemselves. A valley which they passed was grubbed up in all directions\r\nwith furrows made by these animals, so that the soil had all the\r\nappearance of having been ploughed up.\r\n\r\nBurckhardt mentions the occurrence of the wild boar and panther\r\ntogether, or the _ounce_, as he calls it, on the mountain of Rieha, and\r\nalso in the wooded part of Tabor. He mentions \"a common saying and\r\nbelief among the Turks, that all the animal kingdom was converted by\r\ntheir prophet to the true faith, except the wild boar and buffalo, which\r\nremained unbelievers; it is on this account that both these animals are\r\noften called Christians. We are not surprised that the boar should be so\r\ndenominated; but as the flesh of the buffalo, as well as its Leben or\r\nsour milk, is much esteemed by the Turks, it is difficult to account for\r\nthe disgrace into which that animal has fallen among them; the only\r\nreason I could learn for it is, that the buffalo, like the hog, has a\r\nhabit of rolling in the mud, and of plunging into the muddy ponds in the\r\nsummer time up to the very nose, which alone remains visible above the\r\nsurface.\"[198] Wild boars were frequently fallen in with by this\r\ntraveller during his Syrian travels in the neighbourhood of rush-covered\r\nsprings, where they could easily return to their \"wallowing in the\r\nmire;\" he also met with them on all the mountains he visited in his\r\ntour. In the Ghor they are very abundant, and so injurious to the Arabs\r\nof that valley that they are unable to cultivate the common barley on\r\naccount of the eagerness with which the wild swine feed on it, and are\r\nobliged to grow a less esteemed kind, with six rows of grains which the\r\nswine will not touch.\r\n\r\nMessrs Hemprich and Ehrenberg tell us that the wild boar is far\r\nfrom scarce in the marshy districts around Rosetta and Damietta, and\r\nthat it does not seem to differ from the European species. The head of a\r\nwild boar which these travellers saw at Bischerre, a village of Lebanon,\r\nclosely resembled the European variety, except in being a little longer.\r\nThe Maronites there, who ate its flesh in their company, called it\r\n_chansir_,[199] a name evidently identical with the Hebrew word\r\n_chasir_, which occurs in the Bible. The Turks, according to Ehrenberg,\r\nkeep swine in their stables, from a persuasion that all devils who may\r\nenter will be more likely to go into the pigs than the horses, from\r\ntheir alliance to the former unclean animals.--_A. White, in\r\n\"Excelsior.\"_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The River Pig.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIVER PIG, OR PAINTED PIG OF THE CAMAROON.[200]\r\n\r\nThe other day we revisited the Zoological Gardens, and found that two\r\nold friends had got--the one, a companion, the other, a neighbour. The\r\nlatter was the bulky hippopotamus, now most bearish, and more and more\r\nunmistakably showing the minute accuracy of those master lines in the\r\nBook of Job, in which Behemoth's portrait, pose, and character are\r\ndepicted. The former was the subject of this article--evidently, as far\r\nas colour goes, \"the chieftain of the _porcine_ race.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet tells us, however, \"Nimium ne crede colori;\" and observation,\r\nas well as the Scripture, shows us daily that \"fair havens\" in summer\r\nare but foul places to \"winter in;\" that fair speeches, and a flattering\r\ntongue, and the kisses of an enemy, \"are deceitful;\" and that beneath a\r\nfine spotted or barred coat, the jaguar and the tiger, the cobra and the\r\nhornet, conceal both the power and the propensity for mischief. So with\r\nour old friend Potamochoerus. The pretty creature,--beauty is\r\nrelative--the Cameroon pig is the prettiest, the gaudiest of the\r\nrace,--the pretty creature, we repeat, is of a fine bay red, made to\r\nlook more bright from the circumstance of the face, ears, and front of\r\nthe legs being black, while the red is relieved, and the black is\r\ndefined, by the pencilled lines of white which edge the ears, streak\r\nover and under the eye, and ornament the long whiskers, another long\r\nwhite line traversing the middle of the back; a very attractive\r\ncombination of colour--the painting of \"Him who made the world\"--and one\r\nwhich must make the _Potamochoerus penicellatus_ most conspicuous\r\namong the bright green shrubs and dark marshes of the rivers of\r\nequinoctial Africa, on whose banks the race has been planted. The\r\npresent largest specimen was taken, when a \"piggie,\" by a trading\r\ncaptain, as it was swimming across the Cameroon River. He brought it to\r\nLiverpool; Dr Gray, of the British Museum, gave an account of it in the\r\n\"Illustrated Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London for\r\n1852\"--an excellent work--where its figure, drawn and coloured by the\r\nhand of Wolf, shows the condition of the African sow four years ago. It\r\nwas then a round, comfortable, kind-looking creature, which one might\r\nalmost have fondled as a pet. The pig now looks rather a dangerous\r\nbeast, and its beauty is not increased by its face having grown longer,\r\nand by the bump and hollow on each cheek being larger and deeper; nor is\r\nits mouth so attractive or innocent, now that its tusks--those ivory\r\ndaggers and knives of the family of Swine--have grown longer. The\r\ncreature, partly it may be from familiarity, jumps up against the iron\r\npalisade which separates the visitor from its walk, but a poor pannage\r\nas a substitute for its African home. We would advise him to read the\r\nnotice: \"Visitors are requested not to tease the animals;\" \"not to\r\ntouch\" would be a good reprint--for few, we fancy, would try to tease.\r\n\r\nOne, however, especially a lady, likes to know and to feel _texture_;\r\nand sadly used the fine, mild Edward Cross, of Exeter Change and the\r\nSurrey Zoological Gardens, once the Nestor as well as the King among\r\nkeepers of wild beasts--a gentle, gentlemanly, white-haired, venerable\r\nman,--sadly, we say, used Mr Cross to lament that there _were_ parasols,\r\nand that he could not keep them _out_ of his garden. Mr C. told the\r\nwriter that he lost many a beast and bird from the pokes of that\r\ninsinuating weapon. We dissuade any lady from touching or going near a\r\nzebra's mouth, or the horns of an ibex or an algazel, or the pointed\r\nbill of a heron or stork, or from putting her hand near this fine\r\npainted pig.\r\n\r\nUp jumps Potamochoerus--eye rather vindictive, however--and mark, as\r\nthat big specimen is foreshortened before you, the profile of the little\r\ncompanion pig of the same species, standing within a few feet, but safe\r\nfrom the poke of any umbrella or parasol; look how innocent and\r\ninviting--how quiet, and sleek, and polished, and painted, and mild it\r\nlooks, all but that little suspicious eye, with its wink oblique, and\r\nits malicious twinkle.\r\n\r\nOf the habits of this pig we can find no written record, though in the\r\njournals of the Scottish or Wesleyan Missionaries there may be some\r\nnotices of it. We do not know whence the Society procured the second\r\nspecimen, but it shows that Africa's wild animals, like its chain of\r\ninternal Caspian seas, and its mountain-ranges and rivers, are becoming\r\ngradually known. Old Bosman, who was chief factor for the Dutch on the\r\nGold Coast 150 years ago, refers to the swine near Fort St George\r\nd'Elmina being not nearly so wild as those of Europe, and adds, \"I have\r\nseveral times eaten of them here, and found them very delicious and very\r\ntender meat, the fat being extraordinarily fine.\"[201] He evidently\r\nrefers to some other species.\r\n\r\nTravellers in South Africa have made us familiar with the habits, and\r\nspecimens in the Zoological Gardens, in a pannage close to that of the\r\n\"painted pig,\" show us the form and ugliness, of the bush pig and flat\r\npig (_Choiropotamus Africanus_) of that southern land, with their long\r\nheads, long legs, upturned tails, and horrid tusks. They have a strange\r\nhabit of kneeling on their fore-legs. In South Africa they abound; and\r\nthe natives--our excellent friend, the Rev. Henry Methuen, tells\r\nus--often bring their jaws for barter. They are of a dingy, dirty gray;\r\nthe boar is two feet and a half high, and his tusks sometimes measure\r\n\"eleven inches and a half each from the jawbone,\" are five inches and a\r\nhalf in circumference at the base, and are thirteen inches apart at\r\ntheir extremities.\r\n\r\nNo animal is more formidably armed; and his rapidity and lightness of\r\nmovement make him a very marked object to the African Nimrod, who, midst\r\n\"clumps of bush\"--be they Proteacæ, heaths, or Diosmeæ--not unfrequently\r\ncomes on a herd of wild pigs \"headed by a noble boar,\" with tail erect.\r\nWe could enter largely on the history of this active species, and quote\r\nmany a stirring anecdote of travellers' rencontres with this fearless\r\nanimal. The lion skulks away from him, but the rhinoceros--at least one\r\nspecies--the buffalo, with his formidable front of horn and bone, and\r\nthe bush pig, with his dreaded tusks, show but little fear; and it is\r\nwell for the huntsman that he has a sure eye, a steady hand, and a\r\ndouble-barrelled gun, and not a few Caffir followers to help him, should\r\nhis eye be dim, his hand waver, or his gun \"flash in the pan.\" Dogs\r\navail but little; a deadly gash lays open their ribs, and a side-thrust\r\nof a wild boar will cut into the most muscular leg, and for ever destroy\r\nits tendons. We have done with pigs, and would only recommend a visit--a\r\nfrequent visit--to that paradise of animals, the Zoological Gardens,\r\nwhere, a fortnight ago, we saw wild boars from Hesse Darmstadt; wild\r\nboars from Egypt; bush pigs from Africa; peccaries from South America;\r\nand two painted pigs from West Africa; all \"_de grege porci_,\" and in\r\nexcellent health: to say nothing of two hippopotamuses; four \"seraphic\"\r\ngiraffes; antelopes (we did not number them); brush turkeys from\r\nAustralia; an apteryx from New Zealand; the curious white sheathbills\r\nfrom the South Seas; the refulgent metallic green and purple-tinted\r\nmonaul, or Impeyan pheasant, strutting with outspread, light-coloured\r\ntail, just as he courts his plain hen-mate on the Indian mountains; a\r\nfamily of the funny pelicans--cleanliness, ugliness, and contentment in\r\none happy combination; a band of flamingoes; eagles and vultures; the\r\nharpy--that Picton of the birds--looking defiance as he stands, with\r\nupraised crest, flashing eye, and clenched talons, over his food; the\r\nwily otter; the amiable seal, which carries us to the seas and rocks of\r\nmuch-loved Shetland, with their long, winding voes, their\r\nbird-frequented cliffs, and outlying skerries; the Indian thrush, which\r\nreminds one of a \"mavis\" at home; the parrot-house, with its fine\r\ncontrasts of colour and its discordant noises; Penny's Esquimaux\r\ndog--poor fellow, a prisoner, unlike to what he was when, with our dear\r\nfriends Dr Sutherland and Captain Stewart, this very dog breasted the\r\nblast before a sledge in the Wellington Channel.[202] Look at that\r\nwondrous sloth, organised for a life in a Brazilian forest--those two\r\nrestless Polar bears; and though last, not least, those wonders of the\r\ngreat deep, \"the sea-anemones,\" the exquisite red and white \"feathery\"\r\ntentacles of the long cylindrical-twisted serpulæ, and\r\nmarvellously-transparent streaked shrimps, all leg, and feeler, and eye,\r\nand \"nose\"--in the salt-water tanks in the Vivarium.--_A. White, in\r\n\"Excelsior.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nS. BISSET AND HIS LEARNED PIG.\r\n\r\nS. Bisset, formerly referred to, when at Belfast bought a black sucking\r\npig, and after several experiments succeeded in training a creature, so\r\nobstinate and perverse by nature, to become most tractable and docile.\r\nIn August 1783, he took his learned pig to Dublin for exhibition. \"It\r\nwas not only under full command, but appeared as pliant and good-natured\r\nas a spaniel. He had taught it to spell the names of any one in the\r\ncompany, to tell the hour, minute, and second, to make his obeisance to\r\nthe company, and he occasioned many a laugh by his pointing out the\r\nmarried and the unmarried. Some one in authority forced him to leave\r\nDublin, and he died broken-hearted shortly after at Chester, on his way\r\nto London, where forty and more years before he had first been induced\r\nto train animals.\"[203]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUIXOTE BOWLES FOND OF PIGS.\r\n\r\nSouthey records of Quixote Bowles that he \"had a great love for pigs; he\r\nthought them the happiest of all God's creatures, and would walk twenty\r\nmiles to see one that was remarkably fat. This love extended to bacon;\r\nhe was an epicure in it; and whenever he went out to dinner, took a\r\npiece of his own curing in his pocket, and requested the cook to dress\r\nit.\"[204]\r\n\r\n\r\nON JEKYLL NEARLY THROWN DOWN BY A VERY SMALL PIG.\r\n\r\n   \"As Jekyll walk'd out in his gown and his wig,\r\n   He happen'd to tread on a very small pig;\r\n   'Pig of science,' he said, 'or else I'm mistaken,\r\n   For surely thou art an _abridgment of Bacon_.'\"[205]\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD ENOUGH FOR A PIG.\r\n\r\nAn Irish peasant being asked why he permitted his pig to take up its\r\nquarters with his family, made an answer abounding with satirical\r\n_naïveté_. \"Why not? Doesn't the place afford every convenience that _a\r\npig can require_?\"[206]\r\n\r\nMrs Fry, in 1827, visited Ireland on one of her Christian and\r\nphilanthropic tours. In a letter to her children from Armagh she\r\nsays--\"Pigs abound; I think they have rather a more elegant appearance\r\nthan ours, their hair often rather curled. Perhaps naturalists may\r\nattribute this to their intimate association with their betters!\"[207]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRYMAN'S CRITICISM ON THE PIGS IN GAINSBOROUGH'S PICTURE OF THE\r\nGIRL AND PIGS.\r\n\r\nThomas Gainsborough, the great English painter, exhibited, in 1782,\r\namong pictures of noblemen, gentlemen, and ladies, his well-known \"Girl\r\nand Pigs.\"[208]\r\n\r\nWolcot, better known as \"Peter Pindar,\" in his first \"Ode to the Royal\r\nAcademicians,\" refers to this picture.\r\n\r\n   \"And now, O Muse, with song so big,\r\n   Turn round to Gainsborough's Girl and Pig,\r\n   Or Pig and Girl, I rather should have said;\r\n     The pig in white, I must allow,\r\n     Is really a well painted sow,\r\n   I wish to say the same thing of the maid.\"\r\n\r\n\"The expression and truth of nature in the Girl and Pigs,\" remarks\r\nNorthcote, \"were never surpassed. Sir Joshua Reynolds was struck with\r\nit, though he thought Gainsborough ought to have made her a beauty.\"\r\nReynolds, indeed, became the purchaser of the painting at one hundred\r\nguineas, Gainsborough asking but sixty. During its exhibition, it is\r\nsaid to have attracted the attention of a countryman, who\r\nremarked--\"They be deadly like pigs, but nobody ever saw pigs feeding\r\ntogether but what one on 'em had a foot in the trough.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOK AND THE LITTER OF PIGS.\r\n\r\nOnce a gentleman, who had the marvellous gift of shaping a great many\r\nthings out of orange-peel, was displaying his abilities at a\r\ndinner-party before Theodore Hook and Mr Thomas Hill, and succeeded in\r\ncounterfeiting a pig. Mr Hill tried the same feat; and after destroying\r\nand strewing the table with the peel of a dozen oranges, gave it up,\r\nwith the exclamation, \"Hang the pig! I _can't_ make him.\" \"Nay, Hill,\"\r\nexclaimed Hook, glancing at the mess on the table, \"you have done more;\r\ninstead of one pig, you have made a _litter_.\"[209]\r\n\r\nHook, we may add, was an original wit. He did not, like most professed\r\nwits, study his sayings before, and arrange with his seeming opponent\r\nfor an imaginary war of words. He was an _impromptu_ wit.\r\n\r\n\r\nJESTS ABOUT SWINE.\r\n\r\nLord Chancellor Hardwicke's bailiff, having been ordered by his lady to\r\nprocure a sow of a particular description, came one day into the\r\ndining-room when full of company, proclaiming with a burst of joy he\r\ncould not suppress--\"I have been at Royston Fair, my lady, and I have\r\ngot a sow exactly of _your ladyship's_ size.\"[210]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJohn was thought to be very stupid. He was sent to a mill one day, and\r\nthe miller said--\"John, some people say you are a fool! Now, tell me,\r\nwhat you do know, and what you don't know.\"--\"Well,\" replied John, \"I\r\nknow millers' hogs are fat!\"--\"Yes, that's well, John; now, what don't\r\nyou know?\"--\"I don't know _whose corn_ fats 'em.\"[211]\r\n\r\n\r\nPIGS AND SILVER SPOON.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of P---- kept a number of swine at his seat in Wiltshire, and\r\ncrossing the yard one day, he was surprised to see the pigs gathered\r\nround one trough, and making a great noise. Curiosity prompted him to\r\nsee what was the cause, and on looking into the trough he perceived a\r\nlarge silver spoon. A servant-maid came out, and began to abuse the pigs\r\nfor crying so. \"Well they may,\" said his lordship, \"when they have got\r\nbut one _silver spoon_ among them all.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have heard of one nobleman in Strathearn, who, when a young man, used\r\nto be thus addressed by his mother--\"William! how are the children _and\r\nyour pigs_?\"[212]\r\n\r\n\r\nSYDNEY SMITH ON BEAUTIFUL PIGS.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF BEAUTY BY A UTILITARIAN.\r\n\r\n\"Go to the Duke of Bedford's piggery at Woburn, and you will see a breed\r\nof pigs with legs so short, that their stomachs trail upon the ground;\r\na breed of animals entombed in their own fat, overwhelmed with\r\nprosperity, success, and farina. No animal could possibly be so\r\ndisgusting, if it were not useful; but a breeder who has accurately\r\nattended to the small quantity of food it requires to swell this pig out\r\nto such extraordinary dimensions,--the extraordinary genius it displays\r\nfor obesity,--and the laudable propensity of the flesh to desert the\r\ncheap regions of the body, and to agglomerate on those parts which are\r\nworth ninepence a pound,--such an observer of its utility does not\r\nscruple to call these otherwise hideous quadrupeds a beautiful race of\r\npigs!\"[213]\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH STURGE, WHEN A BOY, AND THE PIGS.\r\n\r\nWhen Joseph Sturge, that good Quaker, was in his sixth year, his\r\nbiographer, Henry Richard,[214] records that he was on a visit to a\r\nfriend of his mother's at Frenchay, near Bristol. Sauntering about one\r\nday, he came near the house of an eccentric man, a Quaker, who was much\r\nannoyed by the depredations of his neighbour's pigs. Half in jest, and\r\nhalf in earnest, he told the lad to drive the pigs into a pond close by.\r\nJoseph, nothing loath, set to work with a will, delighted with the fun.\r\nThe woman, to whom the pigs belonged, came out presently, broom in hand,\r\nflourishing it over the young sinner's head. The tempter was standing\r\nby, and sought to cover his share of the transaction by shaking his head\r\nand saying--\"Ah,\r\n\r\n   'Satan finds some mischief still\r\n       For idle hands to do.'\r\n\r\nThe child looked up at him indignantly, and said, 'Thee bee'st Satan\r\nthen, for thee told'st me to do it.'\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[194] \"Letters from Sarawak,\" p. 104. 1854.\r\n\r\n[195] \"Divides the hoof, and is cloven-footed, yet cheweth not the cud\"\r\n(Lev. ii. 7).\r\n\r\n[196] Boner's \"Chamois Hunting in the Mountains of Bavaria,\" p. 97.\r\n\r\n[197] \"Travels\" (Home and Colonial Library), p. 147.\r\n\r\n[198] \"Travels in Syria and the Holy Land,\" p. 9.\r\n\r\n[199] Symbolæ Physicæ.\r\n\r\n[200] _Potamochoerus penicellatus._ [Greek: Potamos], a river; [Greek:\r\nchoiros], a pig; _penicellatus_, pencilled.

Charles\r\nDarwin and Sir Francis Head have given graphic descriptions of the\r\ncatching of the wild horse, which swarms on the Pampas of South America.\r\n\r\nHow pathetic to see the led horse following the bier of a soldier! It\r\nwas, perhaps, the most affecting incident in the long array of the\r\nfuneral of the great Duke.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum at Brussels, Dr Patrick Neill observed, in 1817, \"the\r\nstuffed skin of the horse belonging to one of the Alberts, who governed\r\nthe Low Countries in the time of the Spaniards. It was shot under him in\r\nthe field, and the holes made in the thorax by the musket bullets are\r\nstill very evident.\"[215]\r\n\r\nPoor Copenhagen, the Duke's charger at Waterloo, was buried. Many would\r\nhave liked his skin or skeleton. The Duke resisted all attempts to give\r\nhis old friend up for such a purpose. We hope no resurrectionist\r\nsucceeded in getting up his bones, years after his burial at\r\nStrathfieldsaye.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELL-ROCK HORSE.\r\n\r\nThe Bell-Rock Lighthouse, built on a dangerous range of rocks twelve\r\nmiles south by east from Arbroath, was begun by Robert Stevenson on the\r\n17th August 1807, and finished in October 1810. Mr Jervise[216] records\r\nthat \"one horse, the property of James Craw, a labourer in Arbroath, is\r\nbelieved to have drawn the entire materials of the building. The animal\r\nlatterly became a _pensioner_ of the Lighthouse Commissioners, and was\r\nsent by them to graze on the Island of Inchkeith, where it died of old\r\nage in 1813. Dr John Barclay, the celebrated anatomist, had its bones\r\ncollected and arranged in his museum, which he bequeathed at his death\r\nto the Royal College of Surgeons, and in their museum at Edinburgh the\r\nskeleton of the _Bell-Rock horse_ may yet be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBURKE AND THE HORSE.\r\n\r\nAn anecdote of the humanity of the great Edmund Burke in the year 1762\r\nhas been preserved.[217] \"An Irishman, of the name of Johnson, was\r\nastonishing the town by his horsemanship. All London crowded to see his\r\nfeats of agility and his highly-trained steeds. Dr Johnson and Boswell\r\ntalked of this man's wonderful ability, and the Doctor thought that he\r\nfully deserved encouragement on philosophical grounds. He proved what\r\nhuman perseverance could do. One who saw him riding on three horses at\r\nonce, or dancing upon a wire, might hope, that with the same application\r\nin the profession of his choice, he should attain the same success.\r\nBurke, always ready to encourage his countrymen, and curious in all the\r\nramifications of ingenuity, went frequently to the circus. The favourite\r\nperformance of the evening was that of a handsome black horse, which, at\r\nthe sound of Johnson's whip, would leave the stable, stand with much\r\ndocility at his side, then gallop about the ring, and on hearing the\r\ncrack of the lash again return obediently to its master. On one\r\nunfortunate occasion, the signal was disregarded. The horse-rider flew\r\ninto a rage, and by a blow between the ears, struck the noble animal to\r\nthe earth. The spectators thought the horse was dying, but they had\r\nlittle time to reflect on the sight before they were surprised at seeing\r\na gentleman jump into the ring, rush up to Johnson, and with his eyes\r\nflashing, and every muscle in the face quivering with emotion, shout\r\nout, 'You scoundrel! I have a mind to knock you down.' And Johnson would\r\ncertainly have been laid sprawling in the sawdust beside his panting\r\nsteed, had not the friends of the gentleman interposed, and prevented\r\nhim inflicting such summary chastisement. This incident was long\r\nremembered. When the relater of it, many years afterwards, heard Burke\r\ndeclaiming, on the floor of the House of Commons, against injustice and\r\noppression, his mind naturally reverted to the time when he saw the same\r\nhatred of all cruelty displayed by the same individual as he stood over\r\nthe prostrate body of the poor black horse, prepared to punish the\r\nmiscreant who had felled it to the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID GARRICK AND HIS HORSE.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 Sir Joshua Reynolds visited Dr Warton at Winchester College.\r\nHere he was particularly noticed by George III. and his queen, who were\r\nthen making a tour through the summer encampments. The father of Lord\r\nPalmerston, and David Garrick, the great actor, with others, visited\r\nWarton at the same time.\r\n\r\nMr Northcote[218] relates that a whimsical accident occurred to Garrick\r\nat one of the reviews, which Sir Joshua afterwards recounted with great\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\n\"At one of those field-days in the vicinity, Garrick found it necessary\r\nto dismount, when his horse escaped from his hold and ran off; throwing\r\nhimself immediately into his professional attitude, he cried out, as if\r\non Bosworth field, 'A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!'\"\r\n\r\nThis exclamation, and the accompanying attitude, excited great amazement\r\namongst the surrounding spectators, who knew him not; but it could not\r\nescape his majesty's quick apprehension, for, it being within his\r\nhearing, he immediately said, \"Those must be the tones of Garrick! see\r\nif he is not on the ground.\" The theatrical and dismounted monarch was\r\nimmediately brought to his majesty, who not only condoled with him most\r\ngood humouredly on his misfortune, but flatteringly added, that his\r\ndelivery of Shakspeare could never pass undiscovered.\r\n\r\nThis anecdote of Garrick at Winchester is told in the Rev. John Wool's\r\n\"Life of Warton.\" Mr Taylor says--\"One can't help suspecting Roscius\r\ntook care to make his speech when he knew the king was within earshot--a\r\nlittle bit of that 'artifice' of his which has left such an impression\r\nin the theatre, that the phrase, 'As deep as Garrick,' is still current\r\nstage slang.\"[219]\r\n\r\n\r\nBERNARD GILPIN'S HORSES STOLEN AND RECOVERED.[220]\r\n\r\nThe biographer of the saintly Bernard Gilpin, the apostle of the\r\nnorthern counties of England in the days of Edward VI., and Queens Mary\r\nand Elizabeth, relates that, by the carelessness of his servant, his\r\nhorses were one day stolen. The news was quickly propagated, and every\r\none expressed the highest indignation. The thief was rejoicing over his\r\nprize, when, by the report of the country, he found whose horses he had\r\ntaken. Terrified at what he had done, he instantly came trembling back,\r\nconfessed the fact, returned the horses, and declared he believed the\r\ndevil would have seized him directly had he carried them off, knowing\r\nthem to have been Mr Gilpin's. The biographer gives an instance of his\r\nbenevolent temper. \"One day returning home, he saw in a field several\r\npeople crowding together; and judging that something more than ordinary\r\nhad happened, he rode up to them, and found that one of the horses in a\r\nteam had suddenly dropped down, which they were endeavouring to raise;\r\nbut in vain, for the horse was dead. The owner of it seeming much\r\ndejected with his misfortune, and declaring how grievous a loss it was\r\nto him, Mr Gilpin bade him not be disheartened; \"I'll let you have,\r\nhonest man, that horse of mine,\" and pointed to his servant's. \"Ah!\r\nmaster,\" replied the countryman, \"my pocket will not reach such a beast\r\nas that.\" \"Come, come,\" says Mr Gilpin, \"take him, take him; and when I\r\ndemand my money, then thou shalt pay me.\"[221]\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the horses of the apostolic rector of Houghton-le-Spring\r\nwere safe, even in those horse-stealing times, and in that Border\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HERALD AND GEORGE III.'S HORSE.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Sir Isaac Heard was in company with George III., it was\r\nannounced that his majesty's horse was ready for hunting. \"Sir Isaac,\"\r\nsaid the king, \"are you a judge of horses?\"--\"In my younger days, please\r\nyour majesty, I was a great deal among them,\" was the reply.--\"What do\r\nyou think of this, then?\" said the king, who was by this time preparing\r\nto mount his favourite; and, without waiting for an answer, added, \"We\r\ncall him _Perfection_.\"--\"A most appropriate name,\" replied the courtly\r\nherald, bowing as his majesty reached the saddle, \"for he _bears_ the\r\nbest of characters.\"[222]\r\n\r\n\r\nROWLAND HILL AND HIS HORSE AT DUNBAR.\r\n\r\nMany stories of the excellent but eccentric Rowland Hill are told, but\r\noften with considerable exaggeration. The following may be depended on\r\nfor its accuracy, as it was told by Robert Haldane.[223] It occurred at\r\nDunbar, in September 1797, during an evangelistic tour Hill and Haldane\r\nwere making in Scotland. They were sleeping at Mr Cunningham's, when,\r\nin the morning, intending to proceed southward, on Mr Hill's carriage\r\nbeing brought to the door, his horse was found to be dead lame. A\r\nfarrier was sent for, who, after careful examination, reported that the\r\nseat of the mischief was in the shoulder, that the disease was\r\nincurable, and that they might shoot the poor animal as soon as they\r\npleased. To this proposal Mr Hill was by no means prepared to accede.\r\nIndeed, it seemed to Mr Haldane as precipitate as the conduct of an\r\nIrish sailor on board the _Monarch_, who, on seeing another knocked down\r\nsenseless by a splinter, and supposing his companion to be dead, went up\r\nto Captain Duncan, on the quarter-deck, in the midst of the action with\r\nLanguara, off St Vincent, and exclaimed, \"Shall we jerk him overboard,\r\nsir?\" On that occasion the sailor revived in a short time, and was even\r\nable to work at his gun. In the present instance the horse, too,\r\nrecovered, and was able to carry his master on many a future errand of\r\nmercy. Meanwhile, however, the travellers availed themselves of Mr\r\nCunningham's hospitality, and remained for two days more at his place,\r\nnear Dunbar. In the evening Mr Hill conducted family worship, and after\r\nthe supplications for the family, domestics, and friends, added a\r\nfervent prayer for the restoration of the valuable animal which had\r\ncarried him so many thousands of miles, preaching the everlasting gospel\r\nto his fellow-sinners. Mr Cunningham, who was remarkable for the staid\r\nand orderly, if not stiff, demeanour, which characterised the\r\nanti-burghers, was not only surprised but grieved, and even scandalised,\r\nat what he deemed so great an impropriety. He remonstrated with his\r\nguest. But Mr Hill stoutly defended his conduct by an appeal to\r\nScripture, and the superintending watchfulness of Him without whom a\r\nsparrow falls not to the ground. He persisted in his prayer during the\r\ntwo days he continued at Dunbar, and, although he left the horse, in a\r\nhopeless state, to follow in charge of his servant by easy stages, he\r\ncontinued his prayer, night and morning, till one day, at an inn in\r\nYorkshire, while the two travellers were sitting at breakfast, they\r\nheard a horse and chaise trot briskly into the yard, and, looking out,\r\nsaw that Mr Hill's servant had arrived, bringing up the horse perfectly\r\nrestored. Mr Hill did not fail to return thanks, and begged his\r\nfellow-traveller to consider whether the minuteness of his prayers had\r\ndeserved the censure which had been directed against them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SAYING OF ROWLAND HILL'S.\r\n\r\nRowland Hill rode a great deal, and exercise preserved him in vigorous\r\nhealth. On one occasion, when asked by a medical friend, who was\r\ncommenting on his invariably good health, what physician and apothecary\r\nhe employed, he replied, \"My physician has always been a _horse_, and my\r\napothecary an _ass_!\"[224]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLCROFT ON THE HORSE.\r\n\r\nThomas Holcroft, the novelist and play-writer, when a lad, was a stable\r\nboy to a trainer of running horses. In his memoirs he has written a good\r\ndeal about the habits of the race-horse. He says of them:--\"I soon\r\nlearned that the safehold for sitting steady was to keep the knee and\r\nthe calf of the leg strongly pressed against the sides of the animal\r\nthat endeavours to unhorse you; and as little accidents afford frequent\r\noccasions to remind the boys of this rule, it becomes so rooted in the\r\nmemory of the intelligent, that their danger is comparatively trifling.\r\nOf the temperaments and habits of blood-horses there are great\r\nvarieties, and those very strongly contrasted. The majority of them are\r\nplayful, but their gambols are dangerous to the timid or unskilful. They\r\nare all easily and suddenly alarmed, when anything they do not\r\nunderstand forcibly catches their attention, and they are then to be\r\nfeared by the bad horseman, and carefully guarded against by the good.\r\nVery serious accidents have happened to the best. But, besides their\r\ngeneral disposition to playfulness, there is a great propensity in them\r\nto become what the jockeys call vicious. High bred, hot in blood,\r\nexercised, fed and dressed so as to bring that heat to perfection, their\r\ntender skins at all times subject to a sharp curry-comb, hard brushing,\r\nand when they take sweats, to scraping with wooden instruments, it\r\ncannot be but that they are frequently and exceedingly irritated.\r\nIntending to make themselves felt and feared, they will watch their\r\nopportunity to bite, stamp, or kick; I mean those among them that are\r\nvicious. Tom, the brother of Jack Clarke, after sweating a gray horse\r\nthat belonged to Lord March, with whom he lived, while he was either\r\nscraping or dressing him, was seized by the animal by the shoulder,\r\nlifted from the ground, and carried two or three hundred yards before\r\nthe horse loosened his hold. Old Forrester, a horse that belonged to\r\nCaptain Vernon, all the while that I remained at Newmarket, was obliged\r\nto be kept apart, and being foundered, to live at grass, where he was\r\nconfined to a close paddock. Except Tom Watson, he would suffer no lad\r\nto come near him; if in his paddock, he would run furiously at the\r\nfirst person that approached, and if in the stable, would kick and\r\nassault every one within his reach. Horses of this kind seem always to\r\nselect their favourite boy. Tom Watson, indeed, had attained to man's\r\nestate, and in his brother's absence, which was rare, acted as\r\nsuperintendent. Horses, commonly speaking, are of a friendly and\r\ngenerous nature; but there are anecdotes of the malignant and savage\r\nferocity of some, that are scarcely to be credited; at least many such\r\nare traditional at Newmarket.\r\n\r\nOf their friendly disposition towards their keepers, there is a trait\r\nknown to every boy that has the care of any one of them, which ought not\r\nto be omitted. The custom is to rise very early, even between two and\r\nthree in the morning, when the days lengthen. In the course of the day,\r\nhorses and boys have much to do. About half after eight, perhaps, in the\r\nevening, the horse has his last feed of oats, which he generally stands\r\nto enjoy in the centre of his smooth, carefully made bed of clean long\r\nstraw, and by the side of him the weary boy will often lie down; it\r\nbeing held as a maxim, a rule without exception, that were he to lie\r\neven till morning, the horse would never lie down himself, but stand\r\nstill, careful to do his keeper no harm.[225]\r\n\r\nIn one of Thomas Holcroft's novels, \"Alwyn; or, The Gentleman Comedian,\"\r\nfounded on his own adventures when a travelling actor, he gives the\r\ncharacter of an enthusiast who had conceived the idea of establishing a\r\nhumane asylum for animals, the consequences of which he describes. \"I am\r\npestered, plagued, teased, tormented to death. I believe all the cats\r\nin Christendom are assembled in Oxfordshire. I am obliged to hire a\r\nclerk to pay the people; and the village where I live is become a\r\nconstant fair. A fellow has set up the sign of the Three Blind Kittens,\r\nand has the impudence to tell the neighbours, that if my whims and my\r\nmoney only hold out for one twelvemonth, he shall not care a fig for the\r\nking. I thought to prevent this inundation, by buying up all the old\r\ncats and secluding them in convents and monasteries of my own, but the\r\nvalue of the breeders is increased to such a degree, that I do not\r\nbelieve my whole fortune is capable of the purchase. Besides I am made\r\nan ass of. A rascal, who is a known sharper in these parts, hearing of\r\nthe aversion I had to cruelty, bought an old one-eyed horse, that was\r\ngoing to the dogs, for five shillings; then taking a hammer in his hand,\r\nwatched an opportunity of finding me alone, and addressed me in the\r\nfollowing manner: 'Look you, master, I know that you don't love to see\r\nany dumb creature abused, and so, if you don't give me ten pounds, why,\r\nI shall scoop out this old rip's odd eye with the sharp end of this here\r\nhammer, now, before your face.' Ay, and the villain would have done it\r\ntoo, if I had not instantly complied; but what was worse, the abominable\r\nscoundrel had the audacity to tell me, when I wanted him to deliver the\r\nhorse first, for fear he should extort a further sum from me, that he\r\nhad more honour than to break his word. A whelp of a boy had yesterday\r\ncaught a young hedgehog, and perceiving me, threw it into the water to\r\nmake it extend its legs; then with the rough side of a knotty stick\r\nsawed upon them till the creature cried like a child; and when I ordered\r\nhim to desist, told me he would not, till I had given him sixpence.\r\nThere is something worse than all this. The avaricious rascals, when\r\nthey can find nothing that they think will excite my pity, disable the\r\nfirst animal which is not dignified with the title of Christian, and\r\nthen bring it to me as an object worthy of commiseration; so that, in\r\nfact, instead of protecting, I destroy. The women have entertained a\r\nnotion that I hate two-legged animals; and one of them called after me\r\nthe other day, to tell me I was an old rogue, and that I had better give\r\nmy money to the poor, than keep a parcel of dogs and cats that eat up\r\nthe village. I perceive it is in vain to attempt carrying on the scheme\r\nmuch longer, and then my poor invalids will be worse off than they were\r\nbefore.\"[226]\r\n\r\n\r\nA JOKE OF LORD MANSFIELD'S ABOUT A HORSE.\r\n\r\nLord Campbell[227] tells an anecdote of George Wood, a celebrated\r\nspecial pleader at the time when Lord Mansfield was Chief-Justice.\r\nThough a subtle pleader, George was very ignorant of _horse-flesh_, and\r\nhad been cruelly cheated in the purchase of a horse on which he had\r\nintended to ride the circuit. He brought an action on the warranty that\r\nthe horse was \"a good roadster, and free from vice.\" At the trial before\r\nLord Mansfield, it appeared that when the plaintiff mounted at the\r\nstables in London, with the intention of proceeding to Barnet, nothing\r\ncould induce the animal to move forward a single step. On hearing this\r\nevidence, the Chief-Justice with much gravity exclaimed, \"Who would have\r\nsupposed that Mr Wood's horse would have _demurred_ when he ought to\r\nhave _gone to the country_.\" Any attempt, adds Lord Campbell, to explain\r\nthis excellent joke to _lay gents_ would be vain, and to _lawyers_ would\r\nbe superfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SIR JOHN MOORE AND HIS HORSE AT THE BATTLE OF CORUNNA.\r\n\r\nCharles Napier served in Lord William Bentinck's brigade during the\r\nretreat of the truly great and ill-used Moore at the battle of Corunna;\r\nhe was covered with wounds, and was carried off a prisoner. In his\r\n\"Biography\" General Sir William Napier[228] has published a most\r\ninteresting description of the part his brother took in that battle, and\r\nwritten in his own words. I extract a few vivid lines in which Moore and\r\nhis horse are brought before you. A heavy French column was descending\r\nrapidly on the British line at the part where Napier was. \"Suddenly I\r\nheard the gallop of horses, and turning saw Moore. He came at speed, and\r\npulled up so sharp and close he seemed to have alighted from the air;\r\nman and horse looking at the approaching foe with an intenseness that\r\nseemed to concentrate all feeling in their eyes. The sudden stop of the\r\nanimal, a cream-coloured one, with black tail and mane, had cast the\r\nlatter streaming forward, its ears were pushed out like horns, while its\r\neyes flashed fire, and it snorted loudly with expanded nostrils,\r\nexpressing terror, astonishment, and muscular exertion. My first thought\r\nwas, it will be away like the wind; but then I looked at the rider, and\r\nthe horse was forgotten. Thrown on its haunches the animal came, sliding\r\nand dashing the dirt up with its fore-feet, thus bending the general\r\nforward almost to its neck; but his head was thrown back, and his look\r\nmore keenly piercing than I ever before saw it. He glanced to the right\r\nand left, and then fixed his eyes intently on the enemy's advancing\r\ncolumn, at the same time grasping the reins with both his hands, and\r\npressing the horse firmly with his knees; his body thus seemed to deal\r\nwith the animal, while his mind was intent on the enemy, and his aspect\r\nwas one of searching intenseness, beyond the power of words to describe;\r\nfor a while he looked, and then galloped to the left, without uttering a\r\nword.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNEITHER HORSES NOR CHILDREN CAN EXPLAIN THEIR COMPLAINTS.\r\n\r\nDr Mounsey, the Chelsea doctor, an eccentric physician, who was a great\r\nfriend of David Garrick, related to Taylor that he was once in company\r\nwith another physician and an eminent farrier. The physician stated that\r\namong the difficulties of his profession, was that of discovering the\r\nmaladies of children, because they could not explain the symptoms of\r\ntheir disorder. \"Well,\" said the farrier, \"your difficulties are not\r\ngreater than mine, for my patients, the horses, are equally unable to\r\nexplain their complaints.\"--\"Ah!\" rejoined the physician, \"my brother\r\ndoctor must conquer me, as he has brought his cavalry against my\r\ninfantry!\"[229]\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSES WITH NAMES.\r\n\r\nIn this country most horses have a name, but in Germany this custom must\r\nbe unusual. Perthes, when on his way from Hamburg to Frankfort, remarked\r\nat Böhmte--\"It is a pleasing custom they have here of giving proper\r\nnames to horses. The horse is a noble and intelligent animal, and quite\r\nas deserving of such a distinction as the dog; and when it has a name,\r\nit has made some advance towards personality.\"[230]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"OLD JACK\" OF WATERLOO BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nIn building Waterloo Bridge, the finest of Rennie's bridges, the whole\r\nof the stone required was hewn in some fields on the Surrey side. Nearly\r\nthe whole of this material was drawn by one horse called \"Old Jack,\" a\r\nmost sensible animal. Mr Smiles, in his \"Life of John Rennie,\"[231] thus\r\nspeaks of this favourite old horse--\"His driver was, generally speaking,\r\na steady and trustworthy man; though rather too fond of his dram before\r\nbreakfast. As the railway along which the stone was drawn passed in\r\nfront of the public-house door, the horse and truck were usually pulled\r\nup, while Tom entered for his 'morning.' On one occasion the driver\r\nstayed so long that 'Old Jack,' becoming impatient, poked his head into\r\nthe open door, and taking his master's coat collar between his teeth,\r\nthough in a gentle sort of manner, pulled him out from the midst of his\r\ncompanions, and thus forced him to resume the day's work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYDNEY SMITH AND HIS HORSES.\r\n\r\nSydney Smith, when rector of Foston-le-Clay, in Yorkshire, a living\r\nwhich he got from Lord Chancellor Erskine in 1806, was in the habit of\r\nriding a good deal. His daughter says that, \"either from the badness of\r\nhis horses, or the badness of his riding, or perhaps from both (in spite\r\nof his various ingenious contrivances to keep himself in the saddle), he\r\nhad several falls, and kept us in continual anxiety.\"[232] He writes in\r\na letter--\"I used to think a fall from a horse dangerous, but much\r\nexperience has convinced me to the contrary. I have had six falls in two\r\nyears, and just behaved like the three per cents. when they fall. I got\r\nup again, and am not a bit the worse for it any more than the stock in\r\nquestion.\" In speaking of this he says, \"I left off riding for the good\r\nof my parish and the peace of my family; for, somehow or other, my horse\r\nand I had a habit of parting company. On one occasion I found myself\r\nsuddenly prostrate in the streets of York, much to the delight of the\r\nDissenters. Another time my horse Calamity flung me over his head into a\r\nneighbouring parish, as if I had been a shuttlecock, and I felt grateful\r\nit was not into a neighbouring planet; but as no harm came of it, I\r\nmight have persevered perhaps, if, on a certain day, a Quaker tailor\r\nfrom a neighbouring village to which I had said I was going to ride, had\r\nnot taken it into his head to call, soon after my departure, and request\r\nto see Mrs Sydney. She instantly, conceiving I was thrown, if not\r\nkilled, rushed down to the man, exclaiming, 'Where is he?--where is\r\nyour master?--is he hurt?' The astonished and quaking snip stood silent\r\nfrom surprise. Still more agitated by his silence, she exclaimed, 'Is he\r\nhurt? I insist upon knowing the worst!'--'Why, please, ma'am, it is only\r\nthy little bill, a very small account, I wanted thee to settle,' replied\r\nhe, in much surprise.\r\n\r\n\"After this, you may suppose, I sold my horse; however, it is some\r\ncomfort to know that my friend, Sir George, is one fall ahead of me, and\r\nis certainly a worse rider. It is a great proof, too, of the liberality\r\nof this county, where everybody can ride as soon as they are born, that\r\nthey tolerate me at all.\r\n\r\n\"The horse 'Calamity,' whose name has been thus introduced, was the\r\nfirst-born of several young horses bred on the farm, who turned out very\r\nfine creatures, and gained him great glory, even amongst the knowing\r\nfarmers of Yorkshire; but this first production was certainly not\r\nencouraging. To his dismay a huge, lank, large-boned foal appeared, of\r\nchestnut colour, and with four white legs. It grew apace, but its bones\r\nbecame more and more conspicuous; its appetite was unbounded--grass,\r\nhay, corn, beans, food moist and dry, were all supplied in vain, and\r\nvanished down his throat with incredible rapidity. He stood, a large\r\nliving skeleton, with famine written in his face, and my father\r\nchristened him 'Calamity.' As Calamity grew to maturity, he was found to\r\nbe as sluggish in disposition as his master was impetuous; so my father\r\nwas driven to invent his patent Tantalus, which consisted of a small\r\nsieve of corn, suspended on a semicircular bar of iron, from the ends of\r\nthe shafts, just beyond the horse's nose. The corn, rattling as the\r\nvehicle proceeded, stimulated Calamity to unwonted exertions; and under\r\nthe hope of overtaking this imaginary feed, he did more work than all\r\nthe previous provender which had been poured down his throat had been\r\nable to obtain from him.\"\r\n\r\nHe was very fond of his young horses, and they all came running to meet\r\nhim when he entered the field. He began their education from their\r\nbirth; he taught them to wear a girth, a bridle, a saddle; to meet\r\nflags, music; to bear the firing of a pistol at their heads from their\r\nearliest years; and he maintained that no horses were so well broken as\r\nhis! At p. 388 she records, \"At ten we always went down-stairs to\r\nprayers in the library. Immediately after, if we were alone, appeared\r\nthe 'farmer' at the door, lantern in hand. 'David, bring me my coat and\r\nstick,' and off he set with him, summer and winter, to visit his horses,\r\nand see that they were all well fed, and comfortable in their regions\r\nfor the night. He kept up this custom all his life!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSydney Smith, when at Foston, used to exercise his skill in medicine on\r\nthe poor, and often did much good; his daughter gives some instances of\r\nhis practice as a farrier.\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion, wishing to administer a ball to Peter the Cruel,[233]\r\nthe groom, by mistake, gave him two boxes of opium pills in his bran\r\nmash, which Peter composedly munched, boxes and all. My father, in\r\ndismay, when he heard what had happened, went to look, as he thought,\r\nfor the last time on his beloved Peter; but soon found, to his great\r\nrelief, that neither boxes nor pills had produced any visible effects on\r\nhim. Another time he found all his pigs intoxicated; and, as he\r\ndeclared, 'grunting \"God save the King\" about the stye,' from having\r\neaten some fermented grains which he had ordered for them. Once he\r\nadministered castor-oil to the red cow, in quantities sufficient to have\r\nkilled a regiment of Christians; but the red cow laughed alike at his\r\nskill and his oil, and went on her way rejoicing.\"[234]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSydney Smith tells a story, or made one, of a clergyman who was rather\r\nabsent. \"I heard of a clergyman who went jogging along the road till he\r\ncame to a turnpike. 'What is to pay?'--'Pay, sir, for what?' asked the\r\nturnpike man.--'Why, for my horse, to be sure.'--'Your horse, sir? what\r\nhorse? here is no horse, sir.'--'No horse? God bless me!' said he,\r\nsuddenly, looking down between his legs, 'I thought I was on\r\nhorseback.'\"[235]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGE STORY AND THE NAMES HE GAVE HIS HORSES.\r\n\r\nThe son and biographer of the eminent American judge, Joseph Story,\r\nrelates of him[236]--\"To dumb creatures he was kind and considerate, and\r\nindignant at any ill usage of them. His sportive nature showed itself in\r\nthe nicknames which, in parody of the American fondness of titles, he\r\ngave to his horses and dogs, as, 'The Right Honourable Mr Mouse,' or\r\n'Colonel Roy.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWORDSWORTH ON CRUELTY TO HORSES IN IRELAND.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Cæsar Otway,[237] in a lecture full of interesting anecdotes,\r\nrecords:--\"I remember an observation made to me by one of the most\r\ngifted of the human race--one of the stars of this generation--the poet\r\nof nature and of feeling--the good and the great Mr Wordsworth. Having\r\nthe honour of a conversation with him, after he had made a tour through\r\nIreland, I, in the course of it, asked what was the thing that most\r\nstruck his observation here, as making us differ from the English; and\r\nhe, without hesitation, said it was the ill treatment of our horses;\r\nthat his soul was often, too often, sick within him at the way in which\r\nhe saw these creatures of God abused.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF TAIL.--SHORT-TAILED AND LONG-TAILED HORSES.\r\n\r\nIn an Irish paper was an advertisement for horses to stand at livery on\r\nthe following terms:--\"Long-tailed horses at 3s. 6d. per week;\r\nshort-tailed horses at 3s. per week.\" On inquiry into the cause of the\r\ndifference, it was answered, that the horses with long tails could brush\r\nthe flies off their backs while eating, whereas the short-tailed horses\r\nwere obliged to take their heads _from the manger_, and so ate\r\nless.[238]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[215] \"Journal of Horticultural Tour,\" p. 306.\r\n\r\n[216] \"Memorials of Angus and the Mearns,\" by Andrew Jervise (1861), p.\r\n175.\r\n\r\n[217] \"History of the Life and Times of Edmund Burke,\" by Thomas\r\nMacknight, vol. i. p. 160.\r\n\r\n[218] \"Life of Sir Joshua Reynolds,\" &c., by James Northcote, Esq., R.A.\r\n(2d edition), vol. ii. p. 80.\r\n\r\n[219] \"Life and Times of Sir Joshua Reynolds,\" by C.

But who can bear\r\nhis voice? Surely Coleridge was very fanciful when, in any condition of\r\nasshood, he could write--\r\n\r\n   \"Yea, and more musically sweet to me\r\n   Thy dissonant, harsh bray of joy would be,\r\n   Than warbled melodies that soothe to rest\r\n   The aching of pale Fashion's vacant breast.\"\r\n\r\nThe wild ass, as it roams over the plains of Asia, or is seen in the\r\nZoological gardens along with the gracefully-shaped and prettily-striped\r\nzebra, must be admired by every one.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLINS AND THE OLD DONKEY OF ODELL, COWPER'S MESSENGER AT OLNEY.\r\n\r\nIn July 1823, William Collins, R.A., visited Turvey, in Bedfordshire.\r\nHis son remarks--\"Besides the attractions presented to the pencil by the\r\nnatural beauties of this neighbourhood, its vicinity to Olney, the\r\nfavourite residence of the poet Cowper, gave it, to all lovers of\r\npoetry, a local and peculiar charm. Conspicuous among its inhabitants at\r\nthe time when my father visited it was 'old Odell,' frequently mentioned\r\nby Cowper as the favourite messenger who carried his letters and\r\nparcels. The extreme picturesqueness and genuine rustic dignity of the\r\nold man's appearance made him an admirable subject for pictorial study.\r\nPortraits of him, in water-colours and oils, were accordingly made by my\r\nfather, who introduced him into three of his pictures. The donkey on\r\nwhich he had for years ridden to and fro with letters, was as carefully\r\ndepicted by the painter as his rider. On visiting 'old Odell' a year or\r\ntwo afterwards, Mr Collins observed a strange-looking object hanging\r\nagainst his kitchen wall, and inquired what it was. 'Oh, sir,' replied\r\nthe old man, sorrowfully, 'that is the skin of my poor donkey. He died\r\nof old age, and I did not like to part with him altogether, so I had his\r\nskin dried, and hung up there.' Tears came into his eyes as he spoke of\r\nthe old companion of all his village pilgrimages. The incident might\r\nhave formed a continuation of Sterne's exquisite episode in the\r\n'Sentimental Journey.'\"[240]\r\n\r\nIn his picture of \"The Cherry-Seller,\" painted for Mr Higgins of Turvey\r\nHouse, old Odell and his donkey are chief figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAINSBOROUGH KEPT AN ASS.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Gilpin, in his \"Forest Scenery,\" refers to the\r\npicturesque beauty of the ass in a landscape Berghem often introduced\r\nit; \"and a late excellent landscape-painter (Mr Gainsborough), I have\r\nheard, generally kept this animal by him, that he might have it always\r\nat hand to introduce in various attitudes into his pictures. I have\r\nheard also that a plaster cast of an ass, modelled by him, is sold in\r\nthe shops in London.\"[241]\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISHMAN ON THE RAMSGATE DONKEYS.\r\n\r\nIn former times, when excise officers were not so sharp, there was a\r\ngood deal of smuggling carried on at Ramsgate. Sir Thomas Dick\r\nLauder[242] tells an anecdote of an Irishman there, who being asked to\r\nname the hardest wrought creature in existence, replied, \"Och! a\r\nRamsgate donkey, to be sure; for, faith, afthur carrying angels all day,\r\nbe the powers he is forced to carry speerits all night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nASS'S FOAL.\r\n\r\nDouglas Jerrold and a company of literary friends were out in the\r\ncountry. In the course of their walk they stopped to notice the gambols\r\nof an ass's foal. A very sentimental poet present vowed that he should\r\nlike to send the little thing as a present to his mother. \"Do,\" replied\r\nJerrold, \"and tie a piece of paper round its neck, bearing this motto,\r\n'When this you see, remember me.'\"[243]\r\n\r\n\r\nASS.\r\n\r\nA judge, joking a young barrister, said--\"If you and I were turned into\r\na horse and an ass, which would you prefer to be?\"--\"The ass, to be\r\nsure,\" replied the barrister. \"I've heard of an ass being made a judge,\r\nbut a horse never.\"[244]\r\n\r\nAmmonianus, the grammarian, had an ass which, as it is said, when he\r\nattended the lectures upon poetry, often neglected his food when laid\r\nbefore him, though at the same time he was hungry, so much was the ass\r\ntaken with the love of poetry.[245]\r\n\r\n\r\nWARREN HASTINGS AND THE REFRACTORY DONKEY.\r\n\r\nThe fondness of the first Governor-General of India for horse exercise,\r\nand indeed for the horse itself, was quite oriental, as his biographer\r\nrelates.[246] He was a fine rider, and piqued himself on his abilities\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing pleased him,\" continues Mr Gleig, \"more than to undertake some\r\nanimal which nobody else could control, and to reduce it, as he\r\ninvariably did, to a state of perfect docility. The following anecdote,\r\nwhich I have from my friend Mr Impey, himself an actor in the little\r\ndrama, may suffice to show the extent to which this passion was carried.\r\nIt happened once upon a time, when Mr Impey was, with some other boys,\r\non a visit at Daylesford, that Mr Hastings, returning from a ride, saw\r\nhis young friends striving in vain to manage an ass which they had found\r\ngrazing in the paddock, and which one after another they chose to mount.\r\nThe ass, it appears, had no objection to receive the candidates for\r\nequestrian renown successively on his back, but budge a foot he would\r\nnot; and there being neither saddle nor bridle, wherewith to restrain\r\nhis natural movements, he never failed, so soon as a difference of\r\nopinion arose, to get the better of his rider. Each in his turn, the\r\nboys were repeatedly thrown, till at last Mr Hastings, who watched the\r\nproceedings with great interest, approached.\r\n\r\n\"Why, boys,\" said he, \"how is it that none of you can ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not ride!\" cried the little aspirants; \"we could ride well enough, if\r\nwe had a saddle and a bridle; but he's such an obstinate brute, that we\r\ndon't think even you, sir, could sit him bare-backed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's try,\" exclaimed the Governor-General.\r\n\r\nWhereupon he dismounted, and gave his horse to one of the children to\r\nhold, and mounted the donkey. The beast began to kick up his heels, and\r\nlower his head as heretofore; but this time the trick would not answer.\r\nThe Governor-General sat firm, and finally prevailed, whether by fair\r\nmeans or foul, I am not instructed, in getting the quadruped to move\r\nwheresoever he chose. He himself laughed heartily as he resigned the\r\nconquered thistle-eater to his first friends; and the story when told,\r\nas told it was, with consummate humour, at the dinner-table, afforded\r\ngreat amusement to a large circle of guests.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHCOTE, THE ROYAL ACADEMICIAN, AN ANGEL AT AN ASS.\r\n\r\nFuseli, the artist, was a most outspoken man. His biographer[247] says\r\nthat he never concealed his sentiments with regard to men, even to their\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n\"Every one knows,\" writes Mr Knowles, \"who is acquainted with art, the\r\npowers which Northcote displays when he paints animals of the brute\r\ncreation. When his picture of 'Balaam and the Ass' was exhibited at the\r\nMacklin Gallery, Northcote asked Fuseli's opinion of its merits, who\r\ninstantly said, 'My friend, you are an angel at an ass, but an ass at an\r\nangel.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYDNEY SMITH'S ACCOMPLISHED DONKEY, WITH FRANCIS JEFFREY ON HIS BACK.\r\n\r\nLady Holland[248] gives the following picture of her father's pet\r\ndonkey:--\r\n\r\n\"Amongst our rural delights at Heslington was the possession of a young\r\ndonkey which had been given up to our tender mercies from the time of\r\nits birth, and in whose education we employed a large portion of our\r\nspare time; and a most accomplished donkey it became under our tuition.\r\nIt would walk up-stairs, pick pockets, follow us in our walks like a\r\nhuge Newfoundland dog, and at the most distant sight of us in the field,\r\nwith ears down and tail erect, it set off in full bray to meet us.\r\nThese demonstrations on Bitty's part were met with not less affection on\r\nours, and Bitty was almost considered a member of the family.\r\n\r\n\"One day, when my elder brother and myself were training our beloved\r\nBitty with a pocket-handkerchief for a bridle, and his head crowned with\r\nflowers, to run round our garden, who should arrive in the midst of our\r\nsport but Mr Jeffrey. Finding my father out, he, with his usual kindness\r\ntowards young people, immediately joined in our sport, and to our\r\ninfinite delight, mounted our donkey. He was proceeding in triumph,\r\namidst our shouts of laughter, when my father and mother, in company, I\r\nbelieve, with Mr Horner and Mr Murray, returned from their walk, and\r\nbeheld this scene from the garden-door. Though years and years have\r\npassed away since, I still remember the joy-inspiring laughter that\r\nburst from my father at this unexpected sight, as, advancing towards his\r\nold friend, with a face beaming with delight, and with extended hands,\r\nhe broke forth in the following impromptu:\r\n\r\n   'Witty as Horatius Flaccus,\r\n   As great a Jacobin as Gracchus;\r\n   Short, though not as fat as Bacchus,\r\n   Riding on a little jackass.'\r\n\r\n\"These lines were afterwards repeated by some one to Mr ---- at Holland\r\nHouse, just before he was introduced for the first time to Mr Jeffrey,\r\nand they caught his fancy to such a degree that he could not get them\r\nout of his head, but kept repeating them in a low voice all the time Mr\r\nJeffrey was conversing with him.\r\n\r\n\"I must end Bitty's history, as he has been introduced, by saying that\r\nhe followed us to Foston; and after serving us faithfully for thirteen\r\nyears, on our leaving Yorkshire, was permitted by our kind friend, Lord\r\nCarlisle, to spend the rest of his days in idleness and plenty, in his\r\nbeautiful park, with an unbounded command of thistles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYDNEY SMITH ON THE SAGACITY OF THE ASS; A LADY SCARCELY SO WISE AS ONE.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Sydney Smith[249] writes to Colonel Fox in October 1836:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR CHARLES,--If you have ever paid any attention to the habits of\r\nanimals, you will know that donkeys are remarkably cunning in opening\r\ngates. The way to stop them is to have two latches instead of one. A\r\nhuman being has two hands, and lifts up both latches at once; a donkey\r\nhas only one nose, and latch _a_ drops, as he quits it to lift up latch\r\n_b_. Bobus and I had the grand luck to see little Aunty engaged\r\nintensely with this problem. She was taking a walk, and was arrested by\r\na gate with this formidable difficulty: the donkeys were looking on to\r\nawait the issue. Aunty lifted up the first latch with the most perfect\r\nsuccess, but found herself opposed by a second; flushed with victory,\r\nshe quitted the first latch, and rushed at the second; her success was\r\nequal, till in the meantime the first dropped. She tried this two or\r\nthree times, and, to her utter astonishment, with the same results; the\r\ndonkeys brayed, and Aunty was walking away in great dejection, till\r\nBobus and I recalled her with loud laughter, showed her that she had\r\ntwo hands, and roused her to vindicate her superiority over the donkeys.\r\nI mention this to you to request that you will make no allusion to this\r\nanimal, as she is remarkably touchy on this subject, and also that you\r\nwill not mention it to Lady Mary!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLady Holland relates a practical joke of her father's, which the witty\r\ncanon carried out at his rectory of Combe Florey. \"Opposite was a\r\nbeautiful bank, with a hanging wood of fine old beech and oak, on the\r\nsummit of which presented themselves, to our astonished eyes, two\r\ndonkeys with deers' antlers fastened on their heads, which ever and anon\r\nthey shook, much wondering at their horned honours; whilst the attendant\r\ndonkey boy, in Sunday garb, stood grinning and blushing at their side.\r\n'There, Lady ----! you said the only thing this place wanted to make it\r\nperfect was deer; what do you say now? I have, you see, ordered my game\r\ngamekeeper to drive my deer into the most picturesque point of view.\r\nExcuse their long ears, a little peculiarity belonging to parsonic deer.\r\nTheir voices, too, are singular; but we do our best for you, and you are\r\ntoo true a friend of the Church to mention our defects.' All this, of\r\ncourse, amidst shouts of laughter, whilst his own merry laugh might be\r\nheard above us all, ringing through the valley, and making the very\r\nechoes laugh in chorus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nASSES' DUTY FREE!\r\n\r\nDuring the debate on Sir Robert Peel's tariff, the admission of asses'\r\nduty free caused much merriment. Lord T., who had just read \"Vestiges of\r\nthe Natural History of Creation,\" remarked that the House had, he\r\nsupposed, passed the donkey clause out of respect to its\r\nancestors.--\"It is a wise measure,\" said a popular novelist, \"especially\r\nas it affects the importation of food; for, should a scarcity come, we\r\nshould otherwise have to fall back on the food of our\r\nforefathers.\"--\"And, pray, what is that?\" asked an\r\narchæologist.--\"Thistles,\" replied Lord T.[250]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHACKERAY AND THE EGYPTIAN DONKEY.\r\n\r\nWhen the English author landed at Alexandria, there were many scenes and\r\nsounds to dispel all romantic notions; among these \"a yelling chorus of\r\ndonkey boys shrieking, 'Ride, sir!--donkey, sir!--I say, sir!' in\r\nexcellent English. The placid sphinxes, brooding o'er the Nile,\r\ndisappeared with that wild shriek of the donkey boys. You might be as\r\nwell impressed with Wapping as with your first step on Egyptian soil.\r\n\r\n\"The riding of a donkey is, after all, not a dignified occupation. A man\r\nresists the offer first, somehow as an indignity. How is that poor\r\nlittle, red-saddled, long-eared creature to carry you? Is there to be\r\none for you and another for your legs? Natives and Europeans, of all\r\nsizes, passed by, it is true, mounted upon the same contrivance. I\r\nwaited until I got into a very private spot, where nobody could see me,\r\nand then ascended--why not say descended at once?--on the poor little\r\nanimal. Instead of being crushed at once, as perhaps the writer\r\nexpected, it darted forward, quite briskly and cheerfully, at six or\r\nseven miles an hour; requiring no spur or admonitive to haste, except\r\nthe shrieking of the little Egyptian _gamin_, who ran along by asinus's\r\nside.\"[251]\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST TO LET MULES HAVE THEIR OWN WAY.\r\n\r\nDr John Moore, in crossing the Alps, found they had nothing but the\r\nsagacity of their mules to trust to. \"For my own part,\" he says, \"I was\r\nvery soon convinced that it was much safer on all dubious occasions to\r\ndepend on theirs than on my own. For as often as I was presented with a\r\nchoice of difficulties, and the mule and I were of different opinions,\r\nif, becoming more obstinate than he, I insisted on his taking my track,\r\nI never failed to repent it, and often was obliged to return to the\r\nplace where the controversy had begun, and follow the path to which he\r\nhad pointed at first.\r\n\r\n\"It is entertaining to observe the prudence of these animals in making\r\ntheir way down such dangerous rocks. They sometimes put their heads over\r\nthe edge of the precipice, and examine with anxious circumspection every\r\npossible way by which they can descend, and at length are sure to fix on\r\nthat which, upon the whole, is the best. Having observed this in several\r\ninstances, I laid the bridle on the neck of my mule, and allowed him to\r\ntake his own way, without presuming to control him in the smallest\r\ndegree. This is doubtless the best method, and what I recommend to all\r\nmy friends in their journey through life, when they have mules for their\r\ncompanions.\"[252]\r\n\r\n\r\nZEBRA.--\"_Un âne rayée._\"\r\n\r\nA FRENCHMAN'S \"DOUBLE-ENTENDRE.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1805, Patrick Lattin, an officer of the Irish Brigade, was\r\nresiding in Paris, a M. de Montmorency, whose Christian name was Anne,\r\nmade his appearance, announcing that he was enabled to return to France,\r\nin consequence of the First Consul having scratched his name on the list\r\nof _émigrés_. \"_A present donc_,\" observed Lattin, \"_mon cher Anne, tu\r\nes un Zèbre--un âne rayée._\"[253]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[239] \"The Poems of S.

The camel has a most\r\npatriarchal look about him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN WILLIAM PEEL, R.N. REMARKS ON CAMELS.\r\n\r\nCaptain William Peel, in his \"Ride through the Nubian Desert\" (p. 89),\r\nwrites--\"We met once at a hollow, where some water still remained from\r\nthe rains, 2000 camels, all together admirably organised into troops,\r\nand attended by only a few Arabs. On another occasion, we passed some\r\ncamels grazing at such a distance from the Nile, that I asked the Arab\r\nattending where they went to drink? He said, he marches them all down\r\ntogether to the Nile, and they drink every eleventh day. It is now the\r\ncool season, and the heat is tempered by fresh northerly breezes. The\r\nArab, of course, brings water skins for his own supply. All these camels\r\nwere breeding stock. They live on thorns and the top shoots of the\r\ngum-arabic tree, although it is armed with the most frightful spikes.\r\nBut very little comes amiss to the camel; he will eat dry wood to keep\r\nup digestion, if in want of a substitute. Instinct or experience has\r\ntaught him to avoid the only two tempting-looking plants that grow in\r\nthe desert,--the green eusha bush, which is full of milk-coloured juice,\r\nand a creeper, that grows in the sand where nothing else will grow, and\r\nwhich has a bitter fruit like a melon. I was surprised to learn that the\r\nleopard does not dare to attack the camel, whose tall and narrow flanks\r\nwould seem to be fatally exposed to such a supple enemy. Nature,\r\nhowever, has given him a means of defence in his iron jaw and long\r\npowerful neck, which are a full equivalent for his want of agility. He\r\ncan also strike heavily with his feet, and his roar would intimidate\r\nmany foes. I never felt tired of admiring this noble creature, and\r\nthrough the monotony of the desert would watch for hours his ceaseless\r\ntread and unerring path. Carrying his head low, forward, and surveying\r\neverything with his black brilliant eye, he marches resolutely forward,\r\nand quickens his pace at the slightest cheer of the rider. He is too\r\nintelligent and docile for a bridle; besides, he lives on the march, and\r\nwith a sudden sweep of the neck will seize, without stopping, the\r\nsmallest straw. When the day's march is over, he passes the night in\r\nlooking for food, with scarcely an hour to repose his limbs, and less\r\nthan that for sleep. He closes the eye fitfully, the smallest noise will\r\nawake him. When lying down for rest, every part of the body is\r\nsupported; his neck and head lie lightly along the sand, a broad plate\r\nof bone under the breast takes the weight off his deep chest, and his\r\nlong legs lay folded under him, supporting his sides like a ship in a\r\ncradle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA CAPTAIN IN THE ROYAL NAVY MEASURES THE PROGRESS OF \"THE SHIP OF THE\r\nDESERT.\"\r\n\r\nThe dromedary has long and deservedly been called \"the Ship of the\r\nDesert.\" A very gallant captain in the Royal Navy, the late Captain\r\nWilliam Peel, son of the Prime Minister, calculated its rate of motion\r\nmuch after the manner in which he might have measured the path of his\r\nship. He writes[254]--\"In crossing the Nubian Desert I paid constant\r\nattention to the march of the camels, hoping it may be of some service\r\nhereafter in determining our position. The number of strides in a minute\r\nwith the same foot varied very little, only from 37 to 39, and 38 was\r\nthe average; but the length of the stride was more uncertain, varying\r\nfrom 6 feet 6 to 7 feet 6. As we were always urging the camels, who\r\nseemed, like ourselves, to know the necessity of pushing on across that\r\nfearful tract, I took 7 feet as the average. These figures give a speed\r\nof 2.62 geographical miles per hour, or exactly three English miles,\r\nwhich may be considered as the highest speed that camels lightly loaded\r\ncan keep up on a journey. In general, it will not be more than two and a\r\nhalf English miles. My dromedary was one of the tallest, and the seat of\r\nthe saddle was 6 feet 6 above the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD METCALFE ON A CAMEL WHEN A BOY.\r\n\r\nCharles Metcalfe, \"first and last Lord Metcalfe,\" to whose care were\r\nsuccessively intrusted the three greatest dependencies of the British\r\ncrown, India, Jamaica, and Canada, and who died in 1846, was sent to\r\nEton when eleven years old. His biographer relates,[255] that \"it is on\r\nrecord, and on very sufficient authority, that he was once seen riding\r\non a camel. 'I heard the boys shouting,' said Dr Goodall, many years\r\nafterwards, 'and went out and saw young Metcalfe riding on a camel; so\r\nyou see he was always orientally inclined.'\" This anecdote will serve as\r\na comrade to that told by Mr Foss, in his \"Lives of the Justices of\r\nEngland,\" of Chief-Baron Pollock. When a lad, one of his schoolmasters,\r\nfretted by the boyish energy and exuberant spirits of his scholar, said\r\npetulantly, \"You will live to be _hanged_.\" The old gentleman lived to\r\nsee his pupil Lord Chief-Baron, and, not a little proud of his great\r\nscholar, said, \"I always said he would occupy an _elevated_ position.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[253] Quoted in Timbs' \"Century of Anecdote,\" vol. i. p. 223 (1864).\r\n\r\n[254] \"A Ride through the Nubian Desert,\" by Captain W. Peel, R.N., p.\r\n49.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAGS AND GIRAFFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deer family is rather numerous, and found in many different parts of\r\nthe world. Reindeers abound in some parts even of Spitzbergen, and with\r\nmusk oxen can find their food even under the winter snows of the Parry\r\nIslands. The wapiti and heavy large-headed elk or moose, retreat before\r\nthe advancing civilisation of North America. The Indian mountains and\r\nplains have noble races of deer. No species, however, is more celebrated\r\nthan our red deer. The giraffe is closely allied to the stag family. The\r\nArabs name it the seraph, and indeed, that is the origin of its now\r\nbest-known English name. Visitors should beware of going too near the\r\nmale, for we have seen the dent made by one of the giraffe's bony knobs\r\non a pannel close to its stall. We have heard of a young lady, who\r\nentered the garden one of those summer days when straw bonnets had great\r\nbunches of ripe barley mingled with artificial poppies as an ornament,\r\nand, going too near the lofty pallisade, found to her confusion and\r\nterror that the long lithe tongue of the giraffe had whisked off her\r\nLeghorn, flowers and all, and had begun leisurely to munch it with\r\nsomewhat of the same gusto with which it would have eaten the branch of\r\na graceful mimosa.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL OF DALHOUSIE AND THE FEROCIOUS STAG.\r\n\r\nMr Scrope relates an instance of unprovoked ferocity in a red deer at\r\nTaymouth, in which the present Earl of Dalhousie might have been\r\nseriously injured.\r\n\r\n\"In October 1836, the Hon. Mr and Mrs Fox Maule had left Taymouth with\r\nthe intention of proceeding towards Dalguise; and in driving through\r\nthat part of the grounds where the red deer were kept, they suddenly at\r\na turn of the road came upon the lord of the demesne standing in the\r\ncentre of the passage, as if prepared to dispute it against all comers.\r\nMr Maule being aware that it might be dangerous to trifle with him, or\r\nto endeavour to drive him away (for it was the rutting season),\r\ncautioned the postilion to go slowly, and give the animal an opportunity\r\nof moving off. This was done, and the stag retired to a small hollow by\r\nthe side of the road. On the carriage passing, however, he took offence\r\nat its too near approach, and emerged at a slow and stately pace, till\r\nhe arrived nearly parallel with it. Mr Maule then desired the lad to\r\nincrease his pace, being apprehensive of a charge in the broadside.\r\n\r\n\"The deer, however, had other intentions; for as soon as the carriage\r\nmoved quicker, he increased his pace also, and came on the road about\r\ntwelve yards ahead of it, for the purpose of crossing, as it was\r\nthought, to a lower range of the parks; but to the astonishment and no\r\nlittle alarm of the occupants of the carriage, he charged the offside\r\nhorse, plunging his long brow antler into his chest, and otherwise\r\ncutting him.\r\n\r\n\"The horse that was wounded made two violent kicks, and is supposed to\r\nhave struck the stag, and then the pair instantly ran off the road; and\r\nit was owing solely to the admirable presence of mind and sense of the\r\npostilion, that the carriage was not precipitated over the neighbouring\r\nbank. The horses were not allowed to stop till they reached the gate,\r\nalthough the blood was pouring from the wounded animal in a stream as\r\nthick as a man's finger. He was then taken out of the carriage, and only\r\nsurvived two or three hours. The stag was shortly afterwards\r\nkilled.\"[256]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH COUNT AND THE STAG.\r\n\r\nMr Scrope, in his \"Deer-Stalking,\" describes a grand deer-drive to\r\nGlen-Tilt, headed by the Duke of Athole. Many an incident of this and\r\nsubsequent drives was watched by \"Lightfoot,\" who was present, and whose\r\npictures, under his name of Sir Edwin Landseer, have rendered the life\r\nof the red deer familiar to us, in mist, amid snow, swimming in the\r\nrapid of a Highland current, pursued and at rest, fighting and feeding,\r\nalive and dead, in every attitude, and at every age.\r\n\r\nIn this encounter, the Duke killed three first-rate harts, Lightfoot\r\ntwo, and other rifles were all more or less successful. A French count,\r\nwhose tongue it was difficult to restrain,--and silence is essential to\r\nsuccess in the pursuit,--at last fired into a dense herd of deer.\r\n\r\nMr Scrope adds,[257] \"Everything was propitious--circumstance,\r\nsituation, and effect; for he was descending the mountain in full view\r\nof our whole assemblage of sportsmen. A fine stag in the midst of the\r\nherd fell to the crack of his rifle. 'Hallo, hallo!' forward ran the\r\ncount, and sat upon the prostrate deer triumphing. '_Hé bien, mon ami,\r\nvous êtes mort, donc! Moi, je fais toujours des coups sûrs. Ah! pauvre\r\nenfant!_' He then patted the sides of the animal in pure wantonness, and\r\nlooked east, west, north, and south, for applause, the happiest of the\r\nhappy; finally he extracted a mosaic snuff-box from his pocket, and with\r\nan air which nature has denied to all save the French nation, he held a\r\npinch to the deer's nose--'_Prends, mon ami, prends donc!_' This\r\noperation had scarcely been performed when the hart, who had only been\r\nstunned, or perhaps shot through the loins, sprang up suddenly,\r\noverturned the count, ran fairly away, and was never seen again.\r\n'_Arrêtes, toi traître! Arrêtes, mon enfant! Ah! c'est un enfant, perdu!\r\nAllez donc à tous les diables!_'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVENISON FAT.--REYNOLDS AND THE GOURMAND.\r\n\r\nNorthcote[258] says--\"I have heard Sir Joshua Reynolds relate an\r\nanecdote of a venison feast, at which were assembled many who much\r\nenjoyed the repast.\r\n\r\n\"On this occasion, Reynolds addressed his conversation to one of the\r\ncompany who sat next to him, but to his great surprise could not get a\r\nsingle word in answer, until at length his silent neighbour, turning to\r\nhim, said, 'Mr Reynolds, whenever you are at a venison feast, I advise\r\nyou not to speak during dinner-time, as in endeavouring to answer your\r\nquestions, I have just swallowed a fine piece of the fat, entire,\r\nwithout tasting its flavour.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAG-TRENCH AT FRANKFORT-ON-THE-MAINE.\r\n\r\nGoethe was born at Frankfort-on-the-Maine, August 28th, 1749. In his\r\nautobiography[259] he says--\"The street in which our house was situated\r\npassed by the name of the Stag-trench; but as neither stags nor trenches\r\nwere to be seen, we naturally wished to have the expression explained.\r\nThey told us that our house stood on a spot that was once outside the\r\ntown, and that where the street now ran had formerly been a trench in\r\nwhich a number of stags were kept. The stags were preserved and fatted\r\nhere, because the Senate every year, according to an ancient custom,\r\nfeasted publicly on a stag which was always at hand in the trench for\r\nsuch a festival, in case princes or knights interfered with the city's\r\nright of chase outside, or the walls were encompassed and besieged by an\r\nenemy. This pleased us, and we wished that such a lair for tame wild\r\nanimals could have been seen in our times. Where is there a boy or girl\r\nwho could not join in the wish of this man, who has been called the\r\nfirst European poet and literary man of the nineteenth century?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGIRAFFE.\r\n\r\n\"Fancy,\" said Sydney Smith to some ladies, when he was told that one of\r\nthe giraffes at the Zoological Gardens had caught a cold,--\"fancy a\r\ngiraffe with two yards of sore throat.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of the numbers of _Punch_, published in 1864, the quiz of an\r\nartist has made the giraffes twist their necks into a loose knot by way\r\nof a comforter to keep them from catching a cold, or having a sore\r\nthroat. He has very audaciously caused to be printed under his cut, \"A\r\nFACT.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[255] \"Life and Correspondence of Charles Lord Metcalfe,\" by John\r\nWilliam Kaye, vol. i., p. 8.\r\n\r\n[256] \"The Art of Deer-Stalking,\" p. 33.\r\n\r\n[257] \"Deer-Stalking,\" p. 229.\r\n\r\n[258] \"Life of Sir Joshua Reynolds,\" vol. i., p. 124.\r\n\r\n[259] \"Truth and Poetry from my own Life; the Autobiography of Goethe,\"\r\nedited by Parke Godwin, part i., p. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP AND GOATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are animals, at least the former, which seem to have been created\r\nin a domestic state. They are represented on the most ancient\r\nmonuments. A head of a Lybian ram of very large size, in the British\r\nMuseum, has great resemblance to nature, and there is one slab at least\r\namong the Assyrian monuments where sheep and goats, as part of the spoil\r\nof a city, are rendered with great skill. In the writings of the Ettrick\r\nShepherd, many curious anecdotes of Scottish sheep are given.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MANY LEGS HAS A SHEEP?\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Bradford was brought before the Lord Chancellor to be\r\nexamined upon application for a statute of lunacy against him, the\r\nChancellor asked him, \"How many legs has a sheep?\"--\"Does your lordship\r\nmean,\" answered Lord Bradford, \"a live sheep or a dead sheep?\"--\"Is it\r\nnot the same thing?\" said the Chancellor.--\"No, my lord,\" said Lord\r\nBradford, \"there is much difference: a live sheep may have four legs, a\r\ndead sheep has only two; the two fore-legs are shoulders; there are only\r\n_two legs of mutton_.\"[260]\r\n\r\n\r\nGOETHE ON ROOS'S ETCHINGS OF SHEEP.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Conversations of Goethe with Eckerman and Soret\"[261] in 1824,\r\nhe handed me some etchings by Roos, the famous painter of animals; they\r\nwere all of sheep, in every posture and position. The simplicity of\r\ntheir countenances, the ugliness and shagginess of the fleece--all was\r\nrepresented with the utmost fidelity, as if it were nature itself.\r\n\r\n\"I always feel uneasy,\" said Goethe, \"when I look at these beasts. Their\r\nstate--so limited, dull, gaping, and dreaming--excites in me such\r\nsympathy, that I fear I shall become a sheep, and almost think the\r\nartist must have been one. At all events, it is most wonderful how Roos\r\nhas been able to think and feel himself into the very soul of these\r\ncreatures, so as to make the internal character peer with such force\r\nthrough the outward covering. Here you see what a great talent can do\r\nwhen it keeps steady to subjects which are congenial with its nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has not, then,\" said I, \"this artist also painted dogs, cats, and\r\nbeasts of prey with similar truth; nay, with this great gift of assuming\r\na mental state foreign to himself, has he not been able to delineate\r\nhuman character with equal fidelity?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Goethe; \"all that lay out of his sphere, but the gentle,\r\ngrass-eating animals--sheep, goats, cows, and the like--he was never\r\nweary of repeating; this was the peculiar province of his talent, which\r\nhe did not quit during the whole course of his life. And in this he did\r\nwell. A sympathy with these animals was born with him, a knowledge of\r\ntheir psychological condition was given him, and thus he had so fine an\r\neye for their bodily structure. Other creatures were perhaps not so\r\ntransparent to him, and therefore he felt neither calling nor impulse to\r\npaint them.\"[262]\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD COCKBURN AND THE SHEEP.\r\n\r\nLord Cockburn, the proprietor of Bonaly, that pretty place on the slopes\r\nof the Pentlands, was sitting on the hill-side with the shepherd, and,\r\nobserving the sheep reposing in the coldest situation, he observed to\r\nhim, \"John, if I were a sheep, I would lie on the other side of the\r\nhill.\" The shepherd answered, \"Ay, my lord, but if ye had been a\r\n_sheep_, ye would hae had mair sense.\"[263]\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOLSACK.\r\n\r\nColman and Banister, dining one day with Lord Erskine, the\r\nex-chancellor, amongst other things, observed that he had then about\r\nthree thousand head of sheep. \"I perceive,\" interrupted Colman, \"your\r\nlordship has still an eye to the woolsack.\"[264]\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDY WOOD AND HIS PETS, A SHEEP AND A RAVEN.\r\n\r\nAlexander Wood, a kind-hearted surgeon, who died in his native town of\r\nEdinburgh in May 1807, aged eighty-two, is alluded to by Sir Walter\r\nScott in a prophecy put into the mouth of Meg Merrilees in \"Guy\r\nMannering\"--\"They shall beset his goat; they shall profane his raven,\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe editor of \"Kaye's Edinburgh Portraits\"[265] says that, besides his\r\nkindness of disposition to his fellow-creatures, \"he was almost equally\r\nremarkable for his love of animals. His pets were numerous, and of all\r\nkinds. Not to mention dogs and cats, there were two others that\r\n_individually_ were better known to the citizens of Edinburgh--a sheep\r\nand a raven, the latter of which is alluded to by Scott in 'Guy\r\nMannering.' Willy, the sheep, pastured in the ground adjoining to the\r\nExcise Office, now the Royal Bank, and might be daily seen standing at\r\nthe railings, watching Mr Wood's passing to or from his house in York\r\nPlace, when Willy used to poke his head into his coat-pocket, which was\r\nalways filled with supplies for his favourite, and would then trot along\r\nafter him through the town, and sometimes might be found in the houses\r\nof the doctor's patients. The raven was domesticated at an ale and\r\nporter shop in North Castle Street, which is still, or very lately was,\r\nmarked by a tree growing from the area against the wall. It also kept\r\nupon the watch for Mr Wood, and would recognise him even as he passed at\r\nsome distance along George Street, and, taking a low flight towards him,\r\nwas frequently his companion during some part of his forenoon walks; for\r\nMr Wood never entered his carriage when he could possibly avoid it,\r\ndeclaring that unless a vehicle could be found that would carry him down\r\nthe closes and up the turnpike stairs, they produced nothing but trouble\r\nand inconvenience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CARNAC AND HIS SHE-GOAT.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to see, and not rare to find in men of warlike habits, a\r\nlove for animals. The goat or deer that used often to march before a\r\nregiment with the band as they proceeded to a review in Bruntsfield\r\nLinks, when the writer and his friends were boys, about 1826 to 1832, he\r\nwell remembers. Nor is Edinburgh garrison singular.\r\n\r\nGeneral Carnac, in 1770, communicated to Dr William Hunter some\r\nobservations on the keenness of smell and its exquisite sensibility. He\r\nsays--\"I have frequently observed of tame deer, to whom bread is often\r\ngiven, and which they are in general fond of, that if you present them a\r\npiece that has been bitten, they will not touch it. I have made the same\r\nobservation of a remarkably fine she-goat, which accompanied me in most\r\nof my campaigns in India, and supplied me with milk, and which, in\r\ngratitude for her services, I brought from abroad with me.\"[266]\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN HUNTER AND THE SHAWL-GOAT.\r\n\r\nHUNTER'S METHOD OF INTRODUCING STRANGE ANIMALS PEACEFULLY TO OTHERS IN\r\nHIS MENAGERIE.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to meet with a notice of the pursuits of the great\r\nanatomist, John Hunter, in a rather out-of-the-way book.[267] The\r\ningenious way in which he introduced strange animals into his menagerie\r\nis worthy of notice.\r\n\r\n\"The variety of birds and beasts to be met with at Earl's Court (the\r\nvilla of the celebrated and much-lamented Mr John Hunter) is matter of\r\ngreat entertainment. In the same ground you are surprised to find so\r\nmany living animals in one herd, from the most opposite parts of the\r\nhabitable globe. Buffaloes, rams, and sheep from Turkey, and a\r\nshawl-goat from the East Indies, are among the most remarkable of those\r\nthat meet the eye; and as they feed together in the greatest harmony, it\r\nis natural to inquire, what means are taken to make them so familiar,\r\nand well acquainted with each other. Mr Hunter told me, that when he has\r\na stranger to introduce, he does it by ordering the whole herd to be\r\ntaken to a strange place, either a field, an empty stable, or any other\r\nlarge out-house, with which they are all alike unaccustomed. The\r\nstrangeness of the place so totally engages their attention, as to\r\nprevent them from running at, and fighting with, the new-comer, as they\r\nmost probably would do in their own fields (in regard to which they\r\nentertain very high notions of their exclusive right of property), and\r\nhere they are confined for some hours, till they appear reconciled to\r\nthe stranger, who is then turned out with his new friends, and is\r\ngenerally afterwards well-treated. The shawl-goat was not, however, so\r\neasily reconciled to his future companions; he attacked them, instead of\r\nwaiting to be attacked; fought several battles, and at present appears\r\nmaster of the field.\r\n\r\n\"It is from the _down_ that grows under the coarse hair of this species\r\nof goat, that the fine India shawls are manufactured.[268] This\r\nbeautiful as well as useful animal was brought over only last June from\r\nBombay, in the _Duke of Montrose_ Indiaman, Captain Dorin. The female,\r\nunfortunately, died. It was very obligingly presented by the directors\r\nto Sir John Sinclair, the President of the British Wool Society. It is\r\nproposed, under Mr Hunter's care, to try some experiment with it in\r\nEngland, by crossing it with other breeds of the goat species, before it\r\nis sent to the north.\"\r\n\r\nAs anything that met with Mr Hunter's approval must have been a\r\njudicious arrangement, I may quote from the same source the passage\r\nabout the buildings for his cattle at Earl's Court.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Hunter has built his stables half under ground; also vaults, in\r\nwhich he keeps his cows, buffaloes, and hogs. Such buildings, more\r\nespecially the arched byres, or cow-houses, retain a more equal\r\ntemperature at all times, in regard both to heat and cold, and\r\nconsequently are cooler in summer and warmer in winter; and in\r\nsituations where ground is so valuable as in the neighbourhood of\r\nLondon, are an excellent contrivance. Mr Hunter has his hay-yard over\r\nhis buffaloes' stables. The expense of vaulting does not exceed that of\r\nbuilding and roofing common cow-houses; and the vaults have this\r\nessential advantage or preference, that they require no repairs.\" He\r\nthen gives an account of some buffaloes which Mr Hunter had trained to\r\nwork in a cart, and which became so steady and tractable, that they were\r\noften driven through London streets in the loaded cart, much, no doubt,\r\nto the astonishment of passers-by. With a glimpse of a very beautiful\r\nlittle cow at Earl's Court, from a buffalo and an Alderney, which was\r\nalways plump and fat, and gave very good milk, we must take leave of\r\nJohn Hunter's menagerie.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMODORE KEPPEL \"BEARDS\" THE DEY OF ALGIERS.--A GOAT.\r\n\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds, when twenty-five, sailed to the Mediterranean in\r\n1749 with the Hon. Augustus Keppel, then a captain in the navy, and\r\nafterwards Viscount Keppel. In 1750, Commodore Keppel returned to\r\nAlgiers to remonstrate with the dey on the renewed depredations of the\r\nCorsairs. The dey, surprised at his boldness, for he anchored close to\r\nthe palace, and attended by his captain and a barge's crew, went boldly\r\ninto the presence of the Algerine monarch to demand satisfaction,\r\nexclaimed, that he wondered at the insolence of the King of Great\r\nBritain sending him a beardless boy.\r\n\r\nKeppel was only twenty-four, but he is said to have answered, \"that had\r\nhis Majesty, the King of Great Britain, estimated the degree of wisdom\r\nby the length of the beard, he would have sent him _a goat_ as an\r\nambassador.\" Northcote is in doubt of the truth of this speech having\r\nbeen made, but says, that it is certain Keppel answered with great\r\nboldness.[269] The tyrant is said to have actually ordered his mutes to\r\nadvance with the bow-string, telling the commodore that his life should\r\nanswer for his audacity. Keppel quietly pointed out to the dey the\r\nsquadron at anchor, and told him, that if it was his pleasure to put him\r\nto death, there were Englishmen enough on board to make a funeral pile\r\nof his capital. The dey cooled a little, allowed the commodore to\r\ndepart, and made satisfaction for the damage done, and promised to\r\nabstain from violence in future.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[260] Mark Lemon, \"Jest Book,\" p. 18.\r\n\r\n[261] Translated from the German by John Oxenford, vol. i., p. 138.\r\n\r\n[262] Roos must have been limited in his powers, unlike our Landseer,\r\nwho paints dogs, sheep, horses, cows, stags, and fowls with equal power.\r\n\r\n[263] Dean Ramsay's \"Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character,\" 10th\r\nedition, p. 19.\r\n\r\n[264] Mark Lemon, \"Jest Book,\" p. 214.\r\n\r\n[265] There are two copperplates devoted to the figure and portrait of\r\n\"lang Sandy Wood,\" as he was called.\r\n\r\n[266] \"Philosophical Transactions,\" LXI. p. 176 (1771).

What home landscape\r\nlike that painted by Alfred Tennyson would be perfect without its cows?\r\nMany anecdotes of them could be collected. The Irish are celebrated for\r\ntheir \"bulls,\" one of them is not the worse for having \"Bulls\" for its\r\nsubject. Patrick was telling, so the story goes, that there were four\r\n\"Bull Inns\" in a certain English town. \"There are but three,\" said a\r\nnative of the place, who knew them well; \"the Black Bull, the White\r\nBull, and the Red Bull,--where is the fourth?\"--\"Sure and do you not\r\nknow, the Dun Cow--the best of them all?\" replied the unconscious\r\nMilesian.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GREAT CALF.\r\n\r\nSir William B----, being at a parish meeting, made some proposals, which\r\nwere objected to by a farmer. Highly enraged, \"Sir,\" says he to the\r\nfarmer, \"do you know, sir, that I have been at the two universities, and\r\nat two colleges in each university?\"--\"Well, sir,\" said the farmer,\r\n\"what of that? I had a calf that sucked two cows, and the observation I\r\nmade was, the more he sucked, the greater _calf_ he grew.\"[270]\r\n\r\n\r\nRATHER TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.--VEAL _ad nauseam_.\r\n\r\nAt the table of Lord Polkemmet, when the covers were removed, the\r\ndinner was seen to consist of veal broth, a roast fillet of veal, veal\r\ncutlets, a florentine (an excellent Scotch dish, composed of veal), a\r\ncalf's head, calf's foot jelly. The worthy judge observing an expression\r\nof surprise among his guests, who, even in Shetland in early spring\r\nwould have had the veal varied with fish, broke out in explanation, \"Ou,\r\nay, it's a cauf! when we kill a beast, we just eat up one side, and down\r\nthe tither.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBoswell, the friend and biographer of Johnson, when a young man, went to\r\nthe pit of Covent Garden Theatre, in company with Dr Blair, and in a\r\nfrolic imitated the lowing of a cow; and the universal cry in the\r\ngallery was, \"Encore the cow! encore the cow!\" This was complied with,\r\nand in the pride of success, Boswell attempted to imitate some other\r\nanimals, but with less success. Dr Blair, anxious for the fame of his\r\nfriend, addressed him thus, \"My dear sir, I would confine myself to _the\r\ncow_.\"[271]\r\n\r\n\r\nADAM CLARKE AND HIS BULLOCK PAT.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Adam Clarke, LL.D., after one of his evangelical visits to\r\nIreland, returned to his home at Millbrook. In writing to his sons he\r\nsays--\"Not only your mother, sisters, and brother, were glad to see me,\r\nbut also my poor animals in the field, for I lost no time in going to\r\nvisit them. I found the donkey lame, and her son looking much like a\r\nphilosopher; it was strange that even the _bullock_, whom we call _Pat_,\r\ncame to me in the field, and held out his most honest face for me to\r\nstroke it. The next time I went to him he came running up, and actually\r\nplaced his two fore-feet upon my shoulders, with all the affection of a\r\nspaniel; but it was a load of kindness I could ill bear, for the animal\r\nis nearly three years old; I soon got his feet displaced; strange and\r\nuncouth as this manifestation of affectionate gratitude was, yet with it\r\nthe master and his _steer Pat_ were equally well pleased; so here is a\r\nliteral comment on 'The ox knoweth his owner;' and you see I am in\r\nleague with even the beasts of the field.\"[272]\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL FOOTE AND THE COWS PULLING THE BELL OF WORCESTER COLLEGE CHAPEL.\r\n\r\nSamuel Foote was a student at Worcester College, Oxford, and when there\r\nhe practised many tricks, and soon found out what was ridiculous in any\r\nman's character.\r\n\r\nHis biographer[273] records one of these tricks which he played off on\r\nDr Gower, the provost of the college. \"The church belonging to the\r\ncollege fronted the side of a lane where cattle were sometimes turned\r\nout to graze during the night, and from the steeple hung the bell rope,\r\nvery low in the middle of the outside porch. Foote saw in this an object\r\nlikely to produce some fun, and immediately set about to accomplish his\r\npurpose. He accordingly one night slyly tied a wisp of hay to the rope,\r\nas a bait for the cows in their peregrination to the grazing ground.\r\nThe scheme succeeded to his wish. One of the cows soon after smelling\r\nthe hay as she passed by the church door, instantly seized on it, and,\r\nby tugging at the rope, made the bell ring, to the astonishment of the\r\nsexton and the whole parish.\r\n\r\n\"This happened several nights successively, and the incident gave rise\r\nto various reports, such as not only that the church was haunted by evil\r\nspirits, but that several spectres were seen walking about the\r\nchurchyard in all those hideous and frightful shapes which fear,\r\nignorance, and fancy usually suggest on such occasions.\r\n\r\n\"An event of this kind, however, was to be explored, for the honour of\r\nphilosophy, as well as for the quiet of the parish. Accordingly the\r\ndoctor and the sexton agreed to sit up one night, and on the first alarm\r\nto run out and drag the culprit to condign punishment. Their plan being\r\narranged, they waited with the utmost impatience for the appointed\r\nsignal; at last the bell began to sound its usual alarm, and they both\r\nsallied out in the dark, determined on making a discovery. The sexton\r\nwas the first in the attack. He seized the cow by the tail, and cried\r\nout, 'It was a gentleman commoner, as he had him by the tail of his\r\ngown;' while the doctor, who had caught the cow by the horns at the same\r\ntime, immediately replied, 'No, no, you blockhead, 'tis the postman, and\r\nhere I have hold of the rascal by his blowing-horn.' Lights, however,\r\nwere immediately brought, when the character of the real offender was\r\ndiscovered, and the laugh of the whole town was turned upon the\r\ndoctor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL'S COW.\r\n\r\nAt Plymouth there is, or was, a small green opposite the Government\r\nHouse, over which no one was permitted to pass. Not a creature was\r\nallowed to approach save the general's cow. One day old Lady D----\r\nhaving called at the general's, in order to make a short cut, bent her\r\nsteps across the lawn, when she was arrested by the sentry calling out\r\nand desiring her to return. \"But,\" said Lady D----, with a stately air,\r\n\"do you know who I am?\"--\"I don't know who you be, ma'am,\" replied the\r\nimmovable sentry, \"but I knows you b'aint--you b'aint the _general's\r\ncow_.\" So Lady D---- wisely gave up the argument and went the other\r\nway.[274]\r\n\r\n\r\nGILPIN'S LOVE OF THE PICTURESQUE CARRIED OUT.--A REASON FOR KEEPING\r\nTHREE COWS.\r\n\r\nLord Sidmouth told the Rev. C. Smith Bird that he was partly educated at\r\nCheam, by Mr Gilpin, the author of many volumes on \"Picturesque\r\nScenery.\" He was but a poor scholar, but seems to have been loved by his\r\npupils. He _carried out_ his regard for the picturesque, as would appear\r\nby the following anecdote[275]--\r\n\r\n\"In visiting the Rev. Mr Gilpin at his house in the New Forest on one\r\noccasion, his lordship observed three cows feeding in a small paddock,\r\nwhich he knew to be all that Mr Gilpin had to feed them in. He asked Mr\r\nGilpin how he came to have so many cows when he had so little land? 'The\r\ntruth is,' said he, 'I found one cow would not do--she went\r\ndry.'--'Well,' said Lord Sidmouth, 'but why not be content with another?\r\nTwo, by good management, might be made to supply you constantly with\r\nmilk.'--'Oh, yes,' said the old gentleman, '_but two would not group_.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKING JAMES ON A COW GETTING OVER THE BORDER.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Life of Bernard Gilpin,\" his biographer refers to the\r\ninhabitants of the Borders being such great adepts in the art of\r\nthieving, that they could twist a cow's horn, or mark a horse, so as its\r\nowners could not know it, and so subtle that no vigilance could watch\r\nagainst them. A person telling King James a surprising story of a cow\r\nthat had been driven from the north of Scotland into the south of\r\nEngland, and escaping from the herd had found her way home; \"The most\r\nsurprising part of the story,\" the king replied, \"you lay least stress\r\non--that she passed unstolen through the debateable land.\"[276]\r\n\r\n\r\nDUKE OF MONTAGUE AND HIS HOSPITAL FOR OLD COWS AND HORSES.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Joseph Spence[277] records that \"the Duke of Montague has an\r\nhospital for old cows and horses; none of his tenants near Boughton\r\ndare kill a broken-winded horse; they must bring them all to the\r\n_reservoir_. The duke keeps a lap-dog, the ugliest creature he could\r\nmeet with; he is always fond of the most hideous, and says he was at\r\nfirst kind to them, because nobody else would be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP IV. OF SPAIN IN THE BULL-RING.\r\n\r\nThis king, whose form and features are so well known from the pictures\r\nof Velasquez, was entertained magnificently by his great favourite\r\nOlivares, in 1631. At this festival, which was in honour of the birthday\r\nof the heir apparent, the sports of ancient Rome were renewed in the\r\nbull-ring of Spain. In his life by Mr Stirling,[278] it is recorded that\r\n\"a lion, a tiger, a bear, a camel--in fact, a specimen of every\r\nprocurable wild animal, or, as Quevedo expressed it in a poetical\r\naccount of the spectacle, 'the whole ark of Noah, and all the fables of\r\nÆsop,' were turned loose into the spacious Plaza del Parque, to fight\r\nfor the mastery of the arena. To the great delight of his Castilian\r\ncountrymen, a bull of Xarama vanquished all his antagonists. The 'bull\r\nof Marathon, which ravaged the country of Tetrapolis,' says the\r\nhistorian of the day, 'was not more valiant; nor did Theseus, who slew\r\nand sacrificed him, gain greater glory than did our most potent\r\nsovereign. Unwilling that a beast which had behaved so bravely should go\r\nunrewarded, his majesty determined to do him the greatest favour that\r\nthe animal himself could have possibly desired, had he been gifted with\r\nreason--to wit, to slay him with his own royal hand! Calling for his\r\nfowling-piece, he brought it instantly to his shoulder, and the flash\r\nand report were scarcely seen and heard ere the mighty monster lay a\r\nbleeding corpse before the transported lieges. Yet not a moment,'\r\ncontinues the chronicler, 'did his majesty lose his wonted serenity, his\r\ncomposure of countenance, and becoming gravity of aspect; and but for\r\nthe presence of so great a concourse of witnesses, it was difficult to\r\nbelieve that he had really fired the noble and successful shot.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYDNEY SMITH AND HIS CATTLE.--HIS \"UNIVERSAL SCRATCHER.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Sydney Smith, when at Foston, used to call for his hat and\r\nstick immediately after dinner, and sallied forth for his evening\r\nstroll. His daughter,[279] who often accompanied him, remarks--\"Each cow\r\nand calf, and horse and pig, were in turn visited, and fed, and patted,\r\nand all seemed to welcome him; he cared for their comforts as he cared\r\nfor the comforts of every living being around him. He used to say, 'I am\r\nall for cheap luxuries, even for animals; now all animals have a passion\r\nfor scratching their back bones. They break down your gates and palings\r\nto effect this. Look! there is my universal scratcher, a sharp-edged\r\npole, resting on a high and a low post, adapted to every height, from a\r\nhorse to a lamb. Even the Edinburgh Reviewer can take his turn. You have\r\nno idea how popular it is. I have not had a gate broken since I put it\r\nup. I have it in all my fields.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. AUGUSTUS TOPLADY ON THE FUTURE STATE OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Josiah Bull, in the \"Memorials of the Rev. William Bull of\r\nNewport, Pagnel,\"[280] the friend of Cowper, the poet, and the Rev. John\r\nNewton, tells the following anecdote, in which a favourite theory of the\r\nauthor of that exquisite hymn, \"Rock of Ages Cleft for Me,\" is alluded\r\nto, and somewhat comically illustrated by the author of the \"Olney\r\nHymns:\"--\r\n\r\n\"Mr Newton had been dining with Mr Bull, and they were quietly sitting\r\ntogether, following after 'the things whereby they might edify one\r\nanother,' and that search aided by 'interposing puffs' of the fragrant\r\nweed. It was in that old study I so well remember, ere it was renovated\r\nto meet the demands of modern taste. A room some eighteen feet square,\r\nwith an arched roof, entirely surrounded with many a precious volume,\r\nwith large, old casement windows, and immense square chairs of fine\r\nSpanish mahogany. There these good men were quietly enjoying their\r\n_tête-à-tête_, when they were startled by a thundering knock at the\r\ndoor; and in came Mr Ryland of Northampton, abruptly exclaiming, 'If you\r\nwish to see Mr Toplady, you must go immediately with me to the \"Swan.\"\r\nHe is on his way to London, and will not live long.' They all proceeded\r\nto the inn, and there found the good man, emaciated with disease, and\r\nevidently fast hastening to the grave. As they were talking together,\r\nthey were attracted by a great noise in the street, occasioned, as they\r\nfound on looking out, by a bull-baiting which was going on before the\r\nhouse. Mr Toplady was touched by the cruelty of the scene, and\r\nexclaimed, 'Who could bear to see that sight, if there were not to be\r\nsome compensation for these poor suffering animals in a future\r\nstate?'--'I certainly hope,' said my grandfather, 'that all the bulls\r\nwill go to heaven; but do you think this will be the case with all the\r\nanimal creation?'--'Yes, certainly,' replied Mr Toplady, with great\r\nemphasis, 'all, all!'--'What!' rejoined Mr Newton, with some sarcasm in\r\nhis tone, 'do you suppose, sir, there will be fleas in heaven? for I\r\nhave a special aversion to them.' Mr Toplady said nothing, but was\r\nevidently hurt; and as they separated, Mr Newton said, 'How happy he\r\nshould be to see him at Olney, if God spared his life, and he were to\r\ncome that way again.' The reply Mr Toplady made was not very courteous;\r\nbut the good man was perhaps suffering from the irritation of disease,\r\nand possibly annoyed by the ridicule cast upon a favourite theory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM WINDHAM, M.P., ON THE FEELINGS OF A BAITED\r\nBULL.\r\n\r\nThat great parliamentary orator, the Right Honourable William Windham,\r\nlived before the days when humanity to animals was deemed a fit subject\r\nfor legislation.\r\n\r\nIn his speech against \"the bill for preventing the practice of\r\nbull-baiting\" (April 18, 1800),[281] he refers to the introduction of\r\nsuch a measure as follows--\"In turning from the great interests of this\r\ncountry, and of Europe, to discuss with equal solemnity such measures as\r\nthat which is now before us, the House appears to me to resemble Mr\r\nSmirk, the auctioneer, in the play, who could hold forth just as\r\neloquently upon a ribbon as upon a Raphael.\" He speaks of bull-baiting\r\nas being, \"it must be confessed, at the expense of an animal which is\r\nnot by any means a party to the amusement; but then,\" he adds, \"it\r\nserves to cultivate the qualities of a certain species of dogs, which\r\naffords as much pleasure to their owners as greyhounds do to others. It\r\nis no small recommendation to bull-dogs that they are so much in repute\r\nwith the populace.\" In a second speech, May 24, 1802, he said that he\r\nbelieved \"the bull felt a satisfaction in the contest, not less so than\r\nthe hound did when he heard the sound of the horn that summoned him to\r\nthe chase. True it was that young bulls, or those which were never\r\nbaited before, showed reluctance to be tied to the stake; but those\r\nbulls which, according to the language of the sport, were called _game\r\nbulls_, who were used to baiting, approached the stake, and stood there\r\nwhile preparing for the contest, with the utmost composure. If the bull\r\nfelt no pleasure, and was cruelly dealt with, surely the dogs had also\r\nsome claim to compassion; but the fact was that both seemed equally\r\narduous in the conflict; and the bull, like every other animal, while it\r\nhad the better side, did not dislike his situation--it would be\r\nridiculous to say he felt no pain--yet, when on such occasions he\r\nexhibited no signs of terror, it was a demonstrable proof that he felt\r\nsome pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"sober loyal men\" of Stamford, it would seem, had petitioned for the\r\ncontinuance of their annual sport, which had been continued for a\r\nperiod of five or six hundred years, and who were displeased with their\r\nlandlord, the Marquis of Exeter, for his endeavours to put down their\r\ncruel sport. Windham refers to \"the antiquity of the thing being\r\ndeserving of respect, for respect for antiquity was the best\r\npreservation of the Church and State!!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[270] Mark Lemon, \"Jest Book,\" p. 36.\r\n\r\n[271] Mark Lemon, \"Jest Book,\" p. 111.\r\n\r\n[272] \"An Account of the Religious and Literary Life of Adam Clarke,\r\nLL.D., F.A.S.,\" by a Member of his Family, vol ii., p. 346.\r\n\r\n[273] \"Memoirs of Samuel Foote, Esq.,\" by Wm.

The adventures of\r\nhardy seamen, like Scoresby, in the pursuit of the Greenland whale, or\r\nBeale in the more dangerous chase of the spermaceti, in southern waters,\r\nform the subjects of more than one readable volume. But here we give no\r\nsuch extracts, but content ourselves with four short skits, having the\r\ncetacea for their subject.\r\n\r\nIn these days of zoological gardens, they have succeeded in bringing one\r\nof the smallest of the order, a porpoise, to the Zoological Gardens. His\r\nspeedy dissolution showed that even the bath of a hippopotamus or an\r\nelephant was too limited for the dwelling of this pre-eminently marine\r\ncreature. But he had begun to show an intelligence, they say, which,\r\nindependently of all zoological and anatomical considerations, showed\r\nthat he had nothing in common with a fish, but a somewhat similar form,\r\nand an equal necessity for abundance of the pure liquid element.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHALEBONE.\r\n\r\nA thin old man, with a rag-bag in his hand, was picking up a number of\r\nsmall pieces of whalebone, which lay on the street. The deposit was of\r\nsuch a singular nature, that we asked the quaint-looking gatherer how he\r\nsupposed they came there? \"Don't know,\" he replied, in a squeaking\r\nvoice; \"but I s'pect some unfortunate female was _wrecked_ hereabout\r\nsomewhere.\"[282]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Scotch lady, who was discomposed by the introduction of gas, asked\r\nwith much earnestness, \"What's to become o' the _puir whales_?' deeming\r\ntheir interests materially affected by this superseding of their\r\noil.\"[283]\r\n\r\n\r\nVERY LIKE A WHALE.\r\n\r\n   The first of all the royal infant males\r\n   Should take the title of the Prince of _Wales_:\r\n   Because, 'tis clear to seamen and to lubber,\r\n   Babies and _whales_ are both inclined to _blubber_.[284]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER NORTH ON THE WHALE.\r\n\r\n_Tickler._ What fish, James, would you incline to be, if put into\r\nscales?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd._ A dolphin: for they hae the speed o' lichtnin.
