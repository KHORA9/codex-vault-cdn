They were not to become hunters and rovers, not to be\r\neager to explore quickly the vast wilds beyond; they were to settle down\r\nin the most domestic of lives, as tillers of the soil, as makers of\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nWhat must that sweet air from the land have been to the sea-weary\r\nPuritan women on shipboard, laden to them with its promise of a garden!\r\nfor I doubt not every woman bore with her across seas some little\r\npackage of seeds and bulbs from her English home garden, and perhaps a\r\ntiny slip or plant of some endeared flower; watered each day, I fear,\r\nwith many tears, as well as from the surprisingly scant water supply\r\nwhich we know was on board that ship.\r\n\r\nAnd there also came flying to the _Arbella_ as to the Ark, a Dove--a\r\nbird of promise--and soon the ship came to anchor.\r\n\r\n    \"With hearts revived in conceit new Lands and Trees they spy,\r\n     Scenting the Caedars and Sweet Fern from heat's reflection dry,\"\r\n\r\nwrote one colonist of that arrival, in his _Good Newes from New\r\nEngland_. I like to think that Sweet Fern, the characteristic wild\r\nperfume of New England, was wafted out to greet them. And then all went\r\non shore in the sunshine of that ineffable time and season,--a New\r\nEngland day in June,--and they \"gathered store of fine strawberries,\"\r\njust as their Salem friends had on a June day on the preceding year\r\ngathered strawberries and \"sweet Single Roses\" so resembling the English\r\nEglantine that the hearts of the women must have ached within them with\r\nfresh homesickness. And ere long all had dwelling-places, were they but\r\nhumble log cabins; and pasture lands and commons were portioned out; and\r\nin a short time all had garden-plots, and thus, with sheltering\r\nroof-trees, and warm firesides, and with gardens, even in this lonely\r\nnew world, they had _homes_. The first entry in the Plymouth Records is\r\na significant one; it is the assignment of \"Meresteads and\r\nGarden-Plotes,\" not meresteads alone, which were farm lands, but home\r\ngardens: the outlines of these can still be seen in Plymouth town. And\r\nsoon all sojourners who bore news back to England of the New-Englishmen\r\nand New-Englishwomen, told of ample store of gardens. Ere a year had\r\npassed hopeful John Winthrop wrote, \"My Deare Wife, wee are here in a\r\nParadise.\" In four years the chronicler Wood said in his _New England's\r\nProspect_, \"There is growing here all manner of herbs for meat and\r\nmedicine, and that not only in planted gardens, but in the woods,\r\nwithout the act and help of man.\" Governor Endicott had by that time a\r\nvery creditable garden.\r\n\r\nAnd by every humble dwelling the homesick goodwife or dame, trying to\r\ncreate a semblance of her fair English home so far away, planted in her\r\n\"garden plot\" seeds and roots of homely English flowers and herbs, that\r\nquickly grew and blossomed and smiled on bleak New England's rocky\r\nshores as sturdily and happily as they had bloomed in the old gardens\r\nand by the ancient door sides in England. What good cheer they must have\r\nbrought! how they must have been beloved! for these old English garden\r\nflowers are such gracious things; marvels of scent, lavish of bloom,\r\nbearing such genial faces, growing so readily and hardily, spreading so\r\nquickly, responding so gratefully to such little care: what pure\r\nrefreshment they bore in their blossoms, what comfort in their seeds;\r\nthey must have seemed an emblem of hope, a promise of a new and happy\r\nhome. I rejoice over every one that I know was in those little colonial\r\ngardens, for each one added just so much measure of solace to what seems\r\nto me, as I think upon it, one of the loneliest, most fearsome things\r\nthat gentlewomen ever had to do, all the harder because neither by\r\npoverty nor by unavoidable stress were they forced to it; they came\r\nacross-seas willingly, for conscience' sake. These women were not\r\naccustomed to the thought of emigration, as are European folk to-day;\r\nthey had no friends to greet them in the new land; they were to\r\nencounter wild animals and wild men; sea and country were unknown--they\r\ncould scarce expect ever to return: they left everything, and took\r\nnothing of comfort but their Bibles and their flower seeds. So when I\r\nsee one of the old English flowers, grown of those days, blooming now in\r\nmy garden, from the unbroken chain of blossom to seed of nearly three\r\ncenturies, I thank the flower for all that its forbears did to comfort\r\nmy forbears, and I cherish it with added tenderness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden of the Johnson Mansion, Germantown, Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nWe should have scant notion of the gardens of these New England\r\ncolonists in the seventeenth century were it not for a cheerful\r\ntraveller named John Josselyn, a man of everyday tastes and much\r\ninquisitiveness, and the pleasing literary style which comes from\r\ndirectness, and an absence of self-consciousness. He published in 1672 a\r\nbook entitled _New England's Rarities discovered_, etc., and in 1674\r\nanother volume giving an account of his two voyages hither in 1638 and\r\n1663. He made a very careful list of vegetables which he found thriving\r\nin the new land; and since his flower list is the earliest known, I will\r\ntranscribe it in full; it isn't long, but there is enough in it to make\r\nit a suggestive outline which we can fill in from what we know of the\r\nplants to-day, and form a very fair picture of those gardens.\r\n\r\n  \"Spearmint,\r\n  Rew, will hardly grow\r\n  Fetherfew prospereth exceedingly;\r\n  Southernwood, is no Plant for this Country, Nor\r\n  Rosemary. Nor\r\n  Bayes.\r\n  White-Satten groweth pretty well, so doth\r\n  Lavender-Cotton. But\r\n  Lavender is not for the Climate.\r\n  Penny Royal\r\n  Smalledge.\r\n  Ground Ivey, or Ale Hoof.\r\n  Gilly Flowers will continue two Years.\r\n  Fennel must be taken up, and kept in a Warm Cellar all Winter\r\n  Horseleek prospereth notably\r\n  Holly hocks\r\n  Enula Canpana, in two years time the Roots rot.\r\n  Comferie, with White Flowers.\r\n  Coriander, and\r\n  Dill, and\r\n  Annis thrive exceedingly, but Annis Seed, as also the seed of\r\n  Fennel seldom come to maturity; the Seed of Annis is commonly eaten\r\n    with a Fly.\r\n  Clary never lasts but one Summer, the Roots rot with the Frost.\r\n  Sparagus thrives exceedingly, so does\r\n  Garden Sorrel, and\r\n  Sweet Bryer or Eglantine\r\n  Bloodwort but sorrily, but\r\n  Patience and\r\n  English Roses very pleasantly.\r\n  Celandine, by the West Country now called Kenning Wort grows but slowly.\r\n  Muschater, as well as in England\r\n  Dittander or Pepperwort flourisheth notably and so doth\r\n  Tansie.\"\r\n\r\nThese lists were published fifty years after the landing of the Pilgrims\r\nat Plymouth; from them we find that the country was just as well stocked\r\nwith vegetables as it was a hundred years later when other travellers\r\nmade lists, but the flowers seem few; still, such as they were, they\r\nformed a goodly sight. With rows of Hollyhocks glowing against the rude\r\nstone walls and rail fences of their little yards; with clumps of\r\nLavender Cotton and Honesty and Gillyflowers blossoming freely; with\r\nFeverfew \"prospering\" to sow and slip and pot and give to neighbors just\r\nas New England women have done with Feverfew every year of the centuries\r\nthat have followed; with \"a Rose looking in at the window\"--a\r\nSweetbrier, Eglantine, or English Rose--these colonial dames might well\r\nfind \"Patience growing very pleasantly\" in their hearts as in their\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden at Grumblethorp, Germantown, Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nThey had plenty of pot herbs for their accustomed savoring; and plenty\r\nof medicinal herbs for their wonted dosing. Shakespeare's \"nose-herbs\"\r\nwere not lacking. Doubtless they soon added to these garden flowers many\r\nof our beautiful native blooms, rejoicing if they resembled any beloved\r\nEnglish flowers, and quickly giving them, as we know, familiar old\r\nEnglish plant-names.\r\n\r\nAnd there were other garden inhabitants, as truly English as were the\r\ncherished flowers, the old garden weeds, which quickly found a home and\r\nthrived in triumph in the new soil. Perhaps the weed seeds came over in\r\nthe flower-pot that held a sheltered plant or cutting; perhaps a few\r\nwere mixed with garden seeds; perhaps they were in the straw or other\r\npacking of household goods: no one knew the manner of their coming, but\r\nthere they were, Motherwort, Groundsel, Chickweed, and Wild Mustard,\r\nMullein and Nettle, Henbane and Wormwood. Many a goodwife must have\r\ngazed in despair at the persistent Plantain, \"the Englishman's foot,\"\r\nwhich seems to have landed in Plymouth from the Mayflower.\r\n\r\nJosselyn made other lists of plants which he found in America, under\r\nthese headings:--\r\n\r\n  \"Such plants as are common with us in England.\r\n  Such plants as are proper to the Country.\r\n  Such plants as are proper to the Country and have no name.\r\n  Such plants as have sprung up since the English planted, and kept cattle\r\n    in New England.\"\r\n\r\nIn these lists he gives a surprising number of English weeds which had\r\nthriven and rejoiced in their new home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden of the Bartram House, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nMr. Tuckerman calls Josselyn's list of the fishes of the new world a\r\npoor makeshift; his various lists of plants are better, but they are the\r\nlists of an herbalist, not of a botanist. He had some acquaintance with\r\nthe practice of physic, of which he narrates some examples; and an\r\ninterest in kitchen recipes, and included a few in his books. He said\r\nthat Parkinson or another botanist might have \"found in New England a\r\nthousand, at least, of plants never heard of nor seen by any Englishman\r\nbefore,\" and adds that he was himself an indifferent observer. He\r\ncertainly lost an extraordinary opportunity of distinguishing himself,\r\nindeed of immortalizing himself; and it is surprising that he was so\r\nheedless, for Englishmen of that day were in general eager botanists.\r\nThe study of plants was new, and was deemed of such absorbing interest\r\nand fascination that some rigid Puritans feared they might lose their\r\nimmortal souls through making their new plants their idols.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden of Abigail Adams.]\r\n\r\nWhen Josselyn wrote, but few of our American flowers were known to\r\nEuropean botanists; Indian Corn, Pitcher Plant, Columbine, Milkweed,\r\nEverlasting, and Arbor-vitae had been described in printed books, and the\r\nEvening Primrose. A history of Canadian and other new plants, by Dr.\r\nCornuti, had been printed in Europe, giving thirty-seven of our plants;\r\nand all English naturalists were longing to add to the list; the ships\r\nwhich brought over homely seeds and plants for the gardens of the\r\ncolonists carried back rare American seeds and plants for English physic\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania, from the first years of the settlement, William Penn\r\nencouraged his Quaker followers to plant English flowers and fruit in\r\nabundance, and to try the fruits of the new world. Father Pastorius, in\r\nhis Germantown settlement, assigned to each family a garden-plot of\r\nthree acres, as befitted a man who left behind him at his death a\r\nmanuscript poem of many thousand words on the pleasures of gardening,\r\nthe description of flowers, and keeping of bees. George Fox, the founder\r\nof the Friends, or Quakers, died in 1690. He had travelled in the\r\ncolonies; and in his will he left sixteen acres of land to the Quaker\r\nmeeting in the city of Philadelphia. Of these sixteen acres, ten were\r\nfor \"a close to put Friends' horses in when they came afar to the\r\nMeeting, that they may not be Lost in the Woods,\" while the other six\r\nwere for a site for a meeting-house and school-house, and \"for a\r\nPlayground for the Children of the town to Play on, and for a Garden to\r\nplant with Physical Plants, for Lads and Lasses to know Simples, and to\r\nlearn to make Oils and Ointments.\" Few as are these words, they convey a\r\npositive picture of Fox's intent, and a pleasing picture it is. He had\r\nseen what interest had been awakened and what instruction conveyed\r\nthrough the \"Physick-Garden\" at Chelsea, England; and he promised to\r\nhimself similar interest and information from the study of plants and\r\nflowers by the Quaker \"lads and lasses\" of the new world. Though\r\nnothing came from this bequest, there was a later fulfilment of Fox's\r\nhopes in the establishment of a successful botanic garden in\r\nPhiladelphia, and, in the planting, growth, and flourishing in the\r\nprovince of Pennsylvania of the loveliest gardens in the new world;\r\nthere floriculture reached by the time of the Revolution a very high\r\npoint; and many exquisite gardens bore ample testimony to the \"pride of\r\nlife,\" as well as to the good taste and love of flowers of Philadelphia\r\nFriends. The garden at Grumblethorp, the home of Charles J. Wister,\r\nEsq., of Germantown, Pennsylvania, shown on page 7, dates to colonial\r\ndays and is still flourishing and beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn 1728 was established, by John Bartram, in Philadelphia, the first\r\nbotanic garden in America. The ground on which it was planted, and the\r\nstone dwelling-house he built thereon in 1731, are now part of the park\r\nsystem of Philadelphia. A view of the garden as now in cultivation is\r\ngiven on page 9. Bartram travelled much in America, and through his\r\nconstant correspondence and flower exchanges with distinguished\r\nbotanists and plant growers in Europe, many native American plants\r\nbecame well known in foreign gardens, among them the Lady's Slipper and\r\nRhododendron. He was a Quaker,--a quaint and picturesque figure,--and\r\nhis example helped to establish the many fine gardens in the vicinity of\r\nPhiladelphia. The example and precept of Washington also had important\r\ninfluence; for he was constant in his desire and his effort to secure\r\nevery good and new plant, grain, shrub, and tree for his home at\r\nMount Vernon. A beautiful tribute to his good taste and that of his wife\r\nstill exists in the Mount Vernon flower garden, which in shape, Box\r\nedgings, and many details is precisely as it was in their day. A view of\r\nits well-ordered charms is shown opposite page 12. Whenever I walk in\r\nthis garden I am deeply grateful to the devoted women who keep it in\r\nsuch perfection, as an object-lesson to us of the dignity, comeliness,\r\nand beauty of a garden of the olden times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden at Mount Vernon-on-the-Potomac. Home of George\r\nWashington.]\r\n\r\nThere is little evidence that a general love and cultivation of flowers\r\nwas as common in humble homes in the Southern colonies as in New England\r\nand the Middle provinces. The teeming abundance near the tropics\r\nrendered any special gardening unnecessary for poor folk; flowers grew\r\nand blossomed lavishly everywhere without any coaxing or care. On\r\nsplendid estates there were splendid gardens, which have nearly all\r\nsuffered by the devastations of war--in some towns they were thrice thus\r\nscourged. So great was the beauty of these Southern gardens and so vast\r\nthe love they provoked in their owners, that in more than one case the\r\nlife of the garden's master was merged in that of the garden. The\r\nBritish soldiers during the War of the Revolution wantonly destroyed the\r\nexquisite flowers at \"The Grove,\" just outside the city of Charleston,\r\nand their owner, Mr. Gibbes, dropped dead in grief at the sight of the\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nThe great wealth of the Southern planters, their constant and\r\nextravagant following of English customs and fashions, their fertile\r\nsoil and favorable climate, and their many slaves, all contributed to\r\nthe successful making of elaborate gardens. Even as early as 1682 South\r\nCarolina gardens were declared to be \"adorned with such Flowers as to\r\nthe Smell or Eye are pleasing or agreeable, as the Rose, Tulip, Lily,\r\nCarnation, &c.\" William Byrd wrote of the terraced gardens of Virginia\r\nhomes. Charleston dames vied with each other in the beauty of their\r\ngardens, and Mrs. Logan, when seventy years old, in 1779, wrote a\r\ntreatise called _The Gardener's Kalendar_. Eliza Lucas Pinckney of\r\nCharleston was devoted to practical floriculture and horticulture. Her\r\nintroduction of indigo raising into South Carolina revolutionized the\r\ntrade products of the state and brought to it vast wealth. Like many\r\nother women and many men of wealth and culture at that time, she kept up\r\na constant exchange of letters, seeds, plants, and bulbs with English\r\npeople of like tastes. She received from them valuable English seeds and\r\nshrubs; and in turn she sent to England what were so eagerly sought by\r\nEnglish flower raisers, our native plants. The good will and national\r\npride of ship captains were enlisted; even young trees of considerable\r\nsize were set in hogsheads, and transported, and cared for during the\r\nlong voyage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gate and Hedge of Preston Garden.]\r\n\r\nThe garden at Mount Vernon is probably the oldest in Virginia still in\r\noriginal shape. In Maryland are several fine, formal gardens which do\r\nnot date, however, to colonial days; the beautiful one at Hampton, the\r\nhome of the Ridgelys, in Baltimore County, is shown on pages 57, 60 and\r\n95. In both North and South Carolina the gardens were exquisite. Many\r\nwere laid out by competent landscape gardeners, and were kept in order\r\nby skilled workmen, negro slaves, who were carefully trained from\r\nchildhood to special labor, such as topiary work. In Camden and\r\nCharleston the gardens vied with the finest English manor-house gardens.\r\nRemains of their beauty exist, despite devastating wars and earthquakes.\r\nViews of the Preston Garden, Columbia, South Carolina, are shown on\r\npages 15 and 18 and facing page 54. They are now the grounds of the\r\nPresbyterian College for Women. The hedges have been much reduced\r\nwithin a few years; but the garden still bears a surprising resemblance\r\nto the Garden of the Generalife, Granada. The Spanish garden has fewer\r\nflowers and more fountains, yet I think it must have been the model for\r\nthe Preston Garden. The climax of magnificence in Southern gardens has\r\nbeen for years, at Magnolia-on-the-Ashley, the ancestral home of the\r\nDraytons since 1671. It is impossible to describe the affluence of color\r\nin this garden in springtime; masses of unbroken bloom on giant\r\nMagnolias; vast Camellia Japonicas, looking, leaf and flower, thoroughly\r\nartificial, as if made of solid wax; splendid Crape Myrtles, those\r\nstrange flower-trees; mammoth Rhododendrons; Azaleas of every Azalea\r\ncolor,--all surrounded by walls of the golden Banksia Roses, and hedges\r\ncovered with Jasmine and Honeysuckle. The Azaleas are the special glory\r\nof the garden; the bushes are fifteen to twenty feet in height, and\r\nfifty or sixty feet in circumference, with rich blossoms running over\r\nand crowding down on the ground as if color had been poured over the\r\nbushes; they extend in vistas of vivid hues as far as the eye can reach.\r\nAll this gay and brilliant color is overhung by a startling contrast,\r\nthe most sombre and gloomy thing in nature, great Live-oaks heavily\r\ndraped with gray Moss; the avenue of largest Oaks was planted two\r\ncenturies ago.\r\n\r\nI give no picture of this Drayton Garden, for a photograph of these many\r\nacres of solid bloom is a meaningless thing. Even an oil painting of it\r\nis confused and disappointing. In the garden itself the excess of color\r\nis as cloying as its surfeit of scent pouring from the thousands of open\r\nflower cups; we long for green hedges, even for scanter bloom and for\r\nfainter fragrance. It is not a garden to live in, as are our\r\nbox-bordered gardens of the North, our cheerful cottage borders, and our\r\nwell-balanced Italian gardens, so restful to the eye; it is a garden to\r\nlook at and wonder at.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch settlers brought their love of flowering bulbs, and the bulbs\r\nalso, to the new world. Adrian Van der Donck, a gossiping visitor to New\r\nNetherland when the little town of New Amsterdam had about a thousand\r\ninhabitants, described the fine kitchen gardens, the vegetables and\r\nfruits, and gave an interesting list of garden flowers which he found\r\nunder cultivation by the Dutch vrouws. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"OF THE FLOWERS. The flowers in general which the Netherlanders\r\n     have introduced there are the white and red roses of different\r\n     kinds, the cornelian roses, and stock roses; and those of which\r\n     there were none before in the country, such as eglantine, several\r\n     kinds of gillyflowers, jenoffelins, different varieties of fine\r\n     tulips, crown imperials, white lilies, the lily frutularia,\r\n     anemones, baredames, violets, marigolds, summer sots, etc. The\r\n     clove tree has also been introduced, and there are various\r\n     indigenous trees that bear handsome flowers, which are unknown in\r\n     the Netherlands. We also find there some flowers of native growth,\r\n     as, for instance, sunflowers, red and yellow lilies, mountain\r\n     lilies, morning stars, red, white, and yellow maritoffles (a very\r\n     sweet flower), several species of bell flowers, etc., to which I\r\n     have not given particular attention, but _amateurs_ would hold\r\n     them in high estimation and make them widely known.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fountain Path in Preston Garden, Columbia, South\r\nCarolina.]\r\n\r\nI wish I knew what a Cornelian Rose was, and Jenoffelins, Baredames, and\r\nSummer Sots; and what the Lilies were and the Maritoffles and Bell\r\nFlowers. They all sound so cheerful and homelike--just as if they\r\nbloomed well. Perhaps the Cornelian Rose may have been striped red and\r\nwhite like cornelian stone, and like our York and Lancaster Rose.\r\n\r\nTulips are on all seed and plant lists of colonial days, and they were\r\ndoubtless in every home dooryard in New Netherland. Governor Peter\r\nStuyvesant had a fine farm on the Bouwerie, and is said to have had a\r\nflower garden there and at his home, White Hall, at the Battery, for he\r\nhad forty or fifty negro slaves who were kept at work on his estate. In\r\nthe city of New York many fine formal gardens lingered, on what are now\r\nour most crowded streets, till within the memory of persons now living.\r\nOne is described as full of \"Paus bloemen of all hues, Laylocks, and\r\ntall May Roses and Snowballs intermixed with choice vegetables and herbs\r\nall bounded and hemmed in by huge rows of neatly-clipped Box-edgings.\"\r\n\r\nAn evidence of increase in garden luxury in New York is found in the\r\nadvertisement of one Theophilus Hardenbrook, in 1750, a practical\r\nsurveyor and architect, who had an evening school for teaching\r\narchitecture. He designed pavilions, summer-houses, and garden seats,\r\nand \"Green-houses for the preservation of Herbs with winding Funnels\r\nthrough the walls so as to keep them warm.\" A picture of the green-house\r\nof James Beekman, of New York, 1764, still exists, a primitive little\r\naffair. The first glass-house in North America is believed to be one\r\nbuilt in Boston for Andrew Faneuil, who died in 1737.\r\n\r\nMrs. Anne Grant, writing of her life near Albany in the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, gives a very good description of the Schuyler\r\ngarden. Skulls of domestic animals on fence posts, would seem astounding\r\nhad I not read of similar decorations in old Continental gardens. Vines\r\ngrew over these grisly fence-capitals and birds built their nests in\r\nthem, so in time the Dutch housewife's peaceful kitchen garden ceased\r\nto resemble the kraal of an African chieftain; to this day, in South\r\nAfrica, natives and Dutch Boers thus set up on gate posts the skulls of\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grant writes of the Dutch in Albany:--\r\n\r\n     \"The care of plants, such as needed peculiar care or skill to rear\r\n     them, was the female province. Every one in town or country had a\r\n     garden. Into this garden no foot of man intruded after it was dug\r\n     in the Spring. I think I see yet what I have so often beheld--a\r\n     respectable mistress of a family going out to her garden, on an\r\n     April morning, with her great calash, her little painted basket of\r\n     seeds, and her rake over her shoulder to her garden of labours. A\r\n     woman in very easy circumstances and abundantly gentle in form and\r\n     manners would sow and plant and rake incessantly.\"\r\n\r\nWe have happily a beautiful example of the old Dutch manor garden, at\r\nVan Cortlandt Manor, at Croton-on-Hudson, New York, still in the\r\npossession of the Van Cortlandt family. It is one of the few gardens in\r\nAmerica that date really to colonial days. The manor house was built in\r\n1681; it is one of those fine old Dutch homesteads of which we still\r\nhave many existing throughout New York, in which dignity, comfort, and\r\nfitness are so happily combined. These homes are, in the words of a\r\ntraveller of colonial days, \"so pleasant in their building, and\r\ncontrived so delightful.\" Above all, they are so suited to their\r\nsurroundings that they seem an intrinsic part of the landscape, as they\r\ndo of the old life of this Hudson River Valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Door in Wall of Kitchen Garden at Van Cortlandt Manor.]\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that this Van Cortlandt garden was laid out when the\r\nhouse was built; much of it must be two centuries old. It has been\r\nextended, not altered; and the grass-covered bank supporting the upper\r\ngarden was replaced by a brick terrace wall about sixty years ago. Its\r\npresent form dates to the days when New York was a province. The upper\r\ngarden is laid out in formal flower beds; the lower border is rich in\r\nold vines and shrubs, and all the beloved old-time hardy plants. There\r\nis in the manor-house an ancient portrait of the child Pierre Van\r\nCortlandt, painted about the year 1732. He stands by a table bearing a\r\nvase filled with old garden flowers--Tulip, Convolvulus, Harebell, Rose,\r\nPeony, Narcissus, and Flowering Almond; and it is the pleasure of the\r\npresent mistress of the manor, to see that the garden still holds all\r\nthe great-grandfather's flowers.\r\n\r\nThere is a vine-embowered old door in the wall under the piazza (see\r\nopposite page 20) which opens into the kitchen and fruit garden; a\r\nwall-door so quaint and old-timey that I always remind me of\r\nShakespeare's lines in _Measure for Measure_:--\r\n\r\n    \"He hath a garden circummured with brick,\r\n     Whose western side is with a Vineyard back'd;\r\n     And to that Vineyard is a planched gate\r\n     That makes his opening with this bigger key:\r\n     The other doth command a little door\r\n     Which from the Vineyard to the garden leads.\"\r\n\r\nThe long path is a beautiful feature of this garden (it is shown in the\r\npicture of the garden opposite page 24); it dates certainly to the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century. Pierre Van Cortlandt, the son of the\r\nchild with the vase of flowers, and grandfather of the present\r\ngeneration bearing his surname, was born in 1762. He well recalled\r\nplaying along this garden path when he was a child; and that one day he\r\nand his little sister Ann (Mrs. Philip Van Rensselaer) ran a race along\r\nthis path and through the garden to see who could first \"see the baby\"\r\nand greet their sister, Mrs. Beekman, who came riding to the manor-house\r\nup the hill from Tarrytown, and through the avenue, which shows on the\r\nright-hand side of the garden-picture. This beautiful young woman was\r\nfamed everywhere for her grace and loveliness, and later equally so for\r\nher intelligence and goodness, and the prominent part she bore in the\r\nWar of the Revolution. She was seated on a pillion behind her husband,\r\nand she carried proudly in her arms her first baby (afterward Dr.\r\nBeekman) wrapped in a scarlet cloak. This is one of the home-pictures\r\nthat the old garden holds. Would we could paint it!\r\n\r\nIn this garden, near the house, is a never failing spring and well. The\r\nhouse was purposely built near it, in those days of sudden attacks by\r\nIndians; it has proved a fountain of perpetual youth for the old Locust\r\ntree, which shades it; a tree more ancient than house or garden, serene\r\nand beautiful in its hearty old age. Glimpses of this manor-house garden\r\nand its flowers are shown on many pages of this book, but they cannot\r\nreveal its beauty as a whole--its fine proportions, its noble\r\nbackground, its splendid trees, its turf, its beds of bloom. Oh! How\r\nbeautiful a garden can be, when for two hundred years it has been loved\r\nand cherished, ever nurtured, ever guarded; how plainly it shows such\r\ncare!\r\n\r\nAnother Dutch garden is pictured opposite page 32, the garden of the\r\nBergen Homestead, at Bay Ridge, Long Island. Let me quote part of its\r\ndescription, written by Mrs. Tunis Bergen:--\r\n\r\n     \"Over the half-open Dutch door you look through the vines that\r\n     climb about the stoop, as into a vista of the past. Beyond the\r\n     garden is the great Quince orchard of hundreds of trees in pink and\r\n     white glory. This orchard has a story which you must pause in the\r\n     garden to hear. In the Library at Washington is preserved, in\r\n     quaint manuscript, 'The Battle of Brooklyn,' a farce written and\r\n     said to have been performed during the British occupation. The\r\n     scene is partly laid in 'the orchard of one Bergen,' where the\r\n     British hid their horses after the battle of Long Island--this is\r\n     the orchard; but the blossoming Quince trees tell no tale of past\r\n     carnage. At one side of the garden is a quaint little building with\r\n     moss-grown roof and climbing hop-vine--the last slave kitchen left\r\n     standing in New York--on the other side are rows of homely\r\n     beehives. The old Locust tree overshadowing is an ancient\r\n     landmark--it was standing in 1690. For some years it has worn a\r\n     chain to bind its aged limbs together. All this beauty of tree and\r\n     flower lived till 1890, when it was swept away by the growing city.\r\n     Though now but a memory, it has the perfume of its past flowers\r\n     about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Locust was so often a \"home tree\" and so fitting a one, that I have\r\ngrown to associate ever with these Dutch homesteads a light-leaved\r\nLocust tree, shedding its beautiful flickering shadows on the long roof.\r\nI wonder whether there was any association or tradition that made the\r\nLocust the house-friend in old New York!\r\n\r\nThe first nurseryman in the new world was stern old Governor Endicott of\r\nSalem. In 1644 he wrote to Governor Winthrop, \"My children burnt mee at\r\nleast 500 trees by setting the ground on fire neere them\"--which was a\r\nvery pretty piece of mischief for sober Puritan children. We find all\r\nthoughtful men of influence and prominence in all the colonies raising\r\nvarious fruits, and selling trees and plants, but they had no\r\nindependent business nurseries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden at Van Cortlandt Manor.]\r\n\r\nIf tradition be true, it is to Governor Endicott we owe an indelible dye\r\non the landscape of eastern Massachusetts in midsummer. The Dyer's-weed\r\nor Woad-waxen (_Genista tinctoria_), which, in July, covers hundreds of\r\nacres in Lynn, Salem, Swampscott, and Beverly with its solid growth and\r\nbrilliant yellow bloom, is said to have been brought to this country as\r\nthe packing of some of the governor's household belongings. It is far\r\nmore probable that he brought it here to raise it in his garden for\r\ndyeing purposes, with intent to benefit the colony, as he did other\r\nuseful seeds and plants. Woadwaxen, or Broom, is a persistent thing; it\r\nneeds scythe, plough, hoe, and bitter labor to eradicate it. I cannot\r\ncall it a weed, for it has seized only poor rock-filled land, good for\r\nnaught else; and the radiant beauty of the Salem landscape for many\r\nweeks makes us forgive its persistence, and thank Endicott for bringing\r\nit here.\r\n\r\n                      \"The Broom,\r\n    Full-flowered and visible on every steep,\r\n    Along the copses runs in veins of gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe Broom flower is the emblem of mid-summer, the hottest yellow flower\r\nI know--it seems to throw out heat. I recall the first time I saw it\r\ngrowing; I was told that it was \"Salem Wood-wax.\" I had heard of\r\n\"Roxbury Waxwork,\" the Bitter-sweet, but this was a new name, as it was\r\na new tint of yellow, and soon I had its history, for I find Salem\r\npeople rather proud both of the flower and its story.\r\n\r\nOxeye Daisies (Whiteweed) are also by vague tradition the children of\r\nGovernor Endicott's planting. I think it far more probable that they\r\nwere planted and cherished by the wives of the colonists, when their\r\nbeloved English Daisies were found unsuited to New England's climate and\r\nsoil. We note the Woad-waxen and Whiteweed as crowding usurpers, not\r\nonly because they are persistent, but because their great expanses of\r\nstriking bloom will not let us forget them. Many other English plants\r\nare just as determined intruders, but their modest dress permits them to\r\nslip in comparatively unobserved.\r\n\r\nIt has ever been characteristic of the British colonist to carry with\r\nhim to any new home the flowers of old England and Scotland, and\r\ncharacteristic of these British flowers to monopolize the earth.\r\nSweetbrier is called \"the missionary-plant,\" by the Maoris in New\r\nZealand, and is there regarded as a tiresome weed, spreading and\r\nholding the ground. Some homesick missionary or his more homesick wife\r\nbore it there; and her love of the home plant impressed even the savage\r\nnative. We all know the story of the Scotch settlers who carried their\r\nbeloved Thistles to Tasmania \"to make it seem like home,\" and how they\r\nlived to regret it. Vancouver's Island is completely overrun with Broom\r\nand wild Roses from England.\r\n\r\nThe first commercial nursery in America, in the sense of the term as we\r\nnow employ it, was established about 1730 by Robert Prince, in Flushing,\r\nLong Island, a community chiefly of French Huguenot settlers, who\r\nbrought to the new world many French fruits by seed and cuttings, and\r\nalso a love of horticulture. For over a century and a quarter these\r\nPrince Nurseries were the leading ones in America. The sale of fruit\r\ntrees was increased in 1774 (as we learn from advertisements in the _New\r\nYork Mercury_ of that year), by the sale of \"Carolina Magnolia flower\r\ntrees, the most beautiful trees that grow in America, and 50 large\r\nCatalpa flower trees; they are nine feet high to the under part of the\r\ntop and thick as one's leg,\" also other flowering trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\nThe fine house built on the nursery grounds by William Prince suffered\r\nlittle during the Revolution. It was occupied by Washington and\r\nafterwards house and nursery were preserved from depredations by a guard\r\nplaced by General Howe when the British took possession of Flushing. Of\r\ncourse, domestic nursery business waned in time of war; but an\r\nexcellent demand for American shrubs and trees sprung up among the\r\nofficers of the British army, to send home to gardens in England and\r\nGermany. Many an English garden still has ancient plants and trees from\r\nthe Prince Nurseries.\r\n\r\nThe \"Linnaean Botanic Garden and Nurseries\" and the \"Old American\r\nNursery\" thrived once more at the close of the war, and William Prince\r\nthe second entered in charge; one of his earliest ventures of importance\r\nwas the introduction of Lombardy Poplars. In 1798 he advertises ten\r\nthousand trees, ten to seventeen feet in height. These became the most\r\npopular tree in America, the emblem of democracy--and a warmly hated\r\ntree as well. The eighty acres of nursery grounds were a centre of\r\nbotanic and horticultural interest for the entire country; every tree,\r\nshrub, vine, and plant known to England and America was eagerly sought\r\nfor; here the important botanical treasures of Lewis and Clark found a\r\nhome. William Prince wrote several notable horticultural treatises; and\r\neven his trade catalogues were prized. He established the first\r\nsteamboats between Flushing and New York, built roads and bridges on\r\nLong Island, and was a public-spirited, generous citizen as well as a\r\nman of science. His son, William Robert Prince, who died in 1869, was\r\nthe last to keep up the nurseries, which he did as a scientific rather\r\nthan a commercial establishment. He botanized the entire length of the\r\nAtlantic States with Dr. Torrey, and sought for collections of trees and\r\nwild flowers in California with the same eagerness that others there\r\nsought gold. He was a devoted promoter of the native silk industry,\r\nhaving vast plantations of Mulberries in many cities; for one at\r\nNorfolk, Virginia, he was offered $100,000. It is a curious fact that\r\nthe interest in Mulberry culture and the practice of its cultivation was\r\nso universal in his neighborhood (about the year 1830), that cuttings of\r\nthe Chinese Mulberry (_Morus multicaulis_) were used as currency in all\r\nthe stores in the vicinity of Flushing, at the rate of 12-1/2 cents\r\neach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden at Prince Homestead, Flushing, Long Island.]\r\n\r\nThe Prince homestead, a fine old mansion, is here shown; it is still\r\nstanding, surrounded by that forlorn sight, a forgotten garden. This is\r\nof considerable extent, and evidences of its past dignity appear in the\r\nhedges and edgings of Box; one symmetrical great Box tree is fifty feet\r\nin circumference. Flowering shrubs, unkempt of shape, bloom and beautify\r\nthe waste borders each spring, as do the oldest Chinese Magnolias in the\r\nUnited States. Gingkos, Paulownias, and weeping trees, which need no\r\ngardener's care, also flourish and are of unusual size. There are some\r\nsplendid evergreens, such as Mt. Atlas Cedars; and the oldest and finest\r\nCedar of Lebanon in the United States. It seemed sad, as I looked at the\r\nevidences of so much past beauty and present decay, that this historic\r\nhouse and garden should not be preserved for New York, as the house and\r\ngarden of John Bartram, the Philadelphia botanist, have been for his\r\nnative city.\r\n\r\nWhile there are few direct records of American gardens in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, we have many instructing side glimpses through old business\r\nletter-books. We find Sir Harry Frankland ordering Daffodils and Tulips\r\nfor the garden he made for Agnes Surriage; and it is said that the first\r\nLilacs ever seen in Hopkinton were planted by him for her. The gay young\r\nnobleman and the lovely woman are in the dust, and of all the beautiful\r\nthings belonging to them there remain a splendid Portuguese fan, which\r\nstands as a memorial of that tragic crisis in their life--the great\r\nLisbon earthquake; and the Lilacs, which still mark the site of her\r\nhouse and blossom each spring as a memorial of the shadowed romance of\r\nher life in New England.\r\n\r\nLet me give two pages from old letters to illustrate what I mean by side\r\nglimpses at the contents of colonial gardens. The fine Hancock mansion\r\nin Boston had a carefully-filled garden long previous to the Revolution.\r\nSuch letters as the following were sent by Mr. Hancock to England to\r\nsecure flowers for it:--\r\n\r\n     \"My Trees and Seeds for Capt. Bennett Came Safe to Hand and I like\r\n     them very well. I Return you my hearty Thanks for the Plumb Tree\r\n     and Tulip Roots you were pleased to make me a Present off, which\r\n     are very Acceptable to me. I have Sent my friend Mr. Wilks a mmo.\r\n     to procure for me 2 or 3 Doz. Yew Trees, Some Hollys and Jessamine\r\n     Vines, and if you have Any Particular Curious Things not of a high\r\n     Price, will Beautifye a flower Garden Send a Sample with the Price\r\n     or a Catalogue of 'em, I do not intend to spare Any Cost or Pains\r\n     in making my Gardens Beautifull or Profitable.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S. The Tulip Roots you were Pleased to make a present off to me\r\n     are all Dead as well.\"\r\n\r\nWe find Richard Stockton writing in 1766 from England to his wife at\r\ntheir beautiful home \"Morven,\" in Princeton, New Jersey:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am making you a charming collection of bulbous roots, which\r\n     shall be sent over as soon as the prospect of freezing on your\r\n     coast is over. The first of April, I believe, will be time enough\r\n     for you to put them in your sweet little flower garden, which you\r\n     so fondly cultivate. Suppose I inform you that I design a ride to\r\n     Twickenham the latter end of next month principally to view Mr.\r\n     Pope's gardens and grotto, which I am told remain nearly as he left\r\n     them; and that I shall take with me a gentleman who draws well, to\r\n     lay down an exact plan of the whole.\"\r\n\r\nThe fine line of Catalpa trees set out by Richard Stockton, along the\r\nfront of his lawn, were in full flower when he rode up to his house on a\r\nmemorable July day to tell his wife that he had signed the Declaration\r\nof American Independence. Since then Catalpa trees bear everywhere in\r\nthat vicinity the name of Independence trees, and are believed to be\r\never in bloom on July 4th.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Box at Prince Homestead.]\r\n\r\nIn the delightful diary and letters of Eliza Southgate Bowne (_A Girl's\r\nLife Eighty Years Ago_), are other side glimpses of the beautiful\r\ngardens of old Salem, among them those of the wealthy merchants of the\r\nDerby family. Terraces and arches show a formality of arrangement, for\r\nthey were laid out by a Dutch gardener whose descendants still live in\r\nSalem. All had summer-houses, which were larger and more important\r\nbuildings than what are to-day termed summer-houses; these latter were\r\nknown in Salem and throughout Virginia as bowers. One summer-house had\r\nan arch through it with three doors on each side which opened into\r\nlittle apartments; one of them had a staircase by which you could ascend\r\ninto a large upper room, which was the whole size of the building. This\r\nwas constructed to command a fine view, and was ornamented with Chinese\r\narticles of varied interest and value; it was used for tea-drinkings. At\r\nthe end of the garden, concealed by a dense Weeping Willow, was a\r\nthatched hermitage, containing the life-size figure of a man reading a\r\nprayer-book; a bed of straw and some broken furniture completed the\r\npicture. This was an English fashion, seen at one time in many old\r\nEnglish gardens, and held to be most romantic. Apparently summer\r\nevenings were spent by the Derby household and their visitors wholly in\r\nthe garden and summer-house. The diary keeper writes naively, \"The moon\r\nshines brighter in this garden than anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Dutch Garden of Bergen Homestead.]\r\n\r\nThe shrewd and capable women of the colonies who entered so freely and\r\nsuccessfully into business ventures found the selling of flower seeds a\r\ncongenial occupation, and often added it to the pursuit of other\r\ncallings. I think it must have been very pleasant to buy packages of\r\nflower seed at the same time and place where you bought your best\r\nbonnet, and have all sent home in a bandbox together; each would\r\nprove a memorial of the other; and long after the glory of the bonnet\r\nhad departed, and the bonnet itself was ashes, the thriving Sweet Peas\r\nand Larkspur would recall its becoming charms. I have often seen the\r\nadvertisements of these seedswomen in old newspapers; unfortunately they\r\nseldom gave printed lists of their store of seeds. Here is one list\r\nprinted in a Boston newspaper on March 30, 1760:--\r\n\r\n  Lavender.\r\n  Palma Christi.\r\n  Cerinthe or Honeywort, loved of bees.\r\n  Tricolor.\r\n  Indian Pink.\r\n  Scarlet Cacalia.\r\n  Yellow Sultans.\r\n  Lemon African Marigold.\r\n  Sensitive Plants.\r\n  White Lupine.\r\n  Love Lies Bleeding.\r\n  Patagonian Cucumber.\r\n  Lobelia.\r\n  Catchfly.\r\n  Wing-peas.\r\n  Convolvulus.\r\n  Strawberry Spinage.\r\n  Branching Larkspur.\r\n  White Chrysanthemum.\r\n  Nigaella Romano.\r\n  Rose Campion.\r\n  Snap Dragon.\r\n  Nolana prostrata.\r\n  Summer Savory.\r\n  Hyssop.\r\n  Red Hawkweed.\r\n  Red and White Lavater.\r\n  Scarlet Lupine.\r\n  Large blue Lupine.\r\n  Snuff flower.\r\n  Caterpillars.\r\n  Cape Marigold.\r\n  Rose Lupine.\r\n  Sweet Peas.\r\n  Venus' Navelwort.\r\n  Yellow Chrysanthemum.\r\n  Cyanus minor.\r\n  Tall Holyhock.\r\n  French Marigold.\r\n  Carnation Poppy.\r\n  Globe Amaranthus.\r\n  Yellow Lupine.\r\n  Indian Branching Coxcombs.\r\n  Iceplants.\r\n  Thyme.\r\n  Sweet Marjoram.\r\n  Tree Mallows.\r\n  Everlasting.\r\n  Greek Valerian.\r\n  Tree Primrose.\r\n  Canterbury Bells.\r\n  Purple Stock.\r\n  Sweet Scabiouse.\r\n  Columbine.\r\n  Pleasant-eyed Pink.\r\n  Dwarf Mountain Pink.\r\n  Sweet Rocket.\r\n  Horn Poppy.\r\n  French Honeysuckle.\r\n  Bloody Wallflower.\r\n  Sweet William.\r\n  Honesty (to be sold in small parcels that every one may have a little).\r\n  Persicaria.\r\n  Polyanthos.\r\n  50 Different Sorts of mixed Tulip Roots.\r\n  Ranunculus.\r\n  Gladiolus.\r\n  Starry Scabiouse.\r\n  Curled Mallows.\r\n  Painted Lady topknot peas.\r\n  Colchicum.\r\n  Persian Iris.\r\n  Star Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nThis list is certainly a pleasing one. It gives opportunity for flower\r\nborders of varied growth and rich color. There is a quality of some\r\nminds which may be termed historical imagination. It is the power of\r\nshaping from a few simple words or details of the faraway past, an ample\r\npicture, full of light and life, of which these meagre details are but a\r\nframework. Having this list of the names of these sturdy old annuals and\r\nperennials, what do you perceive besides the printed words? I see that\r\nthe old mid-century garden where these seeds found a home was a cheerful\r\nplace from earliest spring to autumn; that it had many bulbs, and\r\nthereafter a constant succession of warm blooms till the Coxcombs,\r\nMarigolds, Colchicums and Chrysanthemums yielded to New England's\r\nfrosts. I know that the garden had beehives and that the bees were\r\nloved; for when they sallied out of their straw bee-skepes, these happy\r\nbees found their favorite blossoms planted to welcome them: Cerinthe,\r\ndropping with honey; Cacalia, a sister flower; Lupine, Larkspur, Sweet\r\nMarjoram, and Thyme--I can taste the Thyme-scented classic honey from\r\nthat garden! There was variety of foliage as well as bloom, the dovelike\r\nLavender, the glaucous Horned Poppy, the glistening Iceplants, the dusty\r\nRose Campion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Garden at Duck Cove Farm in Narragansett.]\r\n\r\nStately plants grew from the little seed-packets; Hollyhocks, Valerian,\r\nCanterbury Bells, Tree Primroses looked down on the low-growing herbs of\r\nthe border; and there were vines of Convolvulus and Honeysuckle. It was\r\na garden overhung by clouds of perfume from Thyme, Lavender, Sweet Peas,\r\nPleasant-eyed Pink, and Stock. The garden's mistress looked well after\r\nher household; ample store of savory pot herbs grow among the finer\r\nblossoms.\r\n\r\nIt was a garden for children to play in. I can see them; little boys\r\nwith their hair tied in queues, in knee breeches and flapped coats like\r\ntheir stately fathers, running races down the garden path, as did the\r\nVan Cortlandt children; and demure little girls in caps and sacques and\r\naprons, sitting in cubby houses under the Lilac bushes. I know what\r\nflowers they played with and how they played, for they were my\r\ngreat-grandmothers and grandfathers, and they played exactly what I did,\r\nand sang what I did when I was a child in a garden. And suddenly my\r\npicture expands, as a glow of patriotic interest thrills me in the\r\nthought that in this garden were sheltered and amused the boys of one\r\nhundred and forty years ago, who became the heroes of our American\r\nRevolution; and the girls who were Daughters of Liberty, who spun and\r\nwove and knit for their soldiers, and drank heroically their miserable\r\nLiberty tea. I fear the garden faded when bitter war scourged the land,\r\nwhen the women turned from their flower beds to the plough and the\r\nfield, since their brothers and husbands were on the frontier.\r\n\r\nBut when that winter of gloom to our country and darkness to the garden\r\nwas ended, the flowers bloomed still more brightly, and to the cheerful\r\nseedlings of the old garden is now given perpetual youth and beauty;\r\nthey are fated never to grow faded or neglected or sad, but to live and\r\nblossom and smile forever in the sunshine of our hearts through the\r\nmagic power of a few printed words in a time-worn old news-sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFRONT DOORYARDS\r\n\r\n     \"There are few of us who cannot remember a front yard garden which\r\n     seemed to us a very paradise in childhood. Whether the house was a\r\n     fine one and the enclosure spacious, or whether it was a small\r\n     house with only a narrow bit of ground in front, the yard was kept\r\n     with care, and was different from the rest of the land\r\n     altogether.... People do not know what they lose when they make way\r\n     with the reserve, the separateness, the sanctity, of the front yard\r\n     of their grandmothers. It is like writing down family secrets for\r\n     any one to read; it is like having everybody call you by your first\r\n     name, or sitting in any pew in church.\"\r\n\r\n     --_Country Byways_, SARAH ORNE JEWETT, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld New England villages and small towns and well-kept New England farms\r\nhad universally a simple and pleasing form of garden called the front\r\nyard or front dooryard. A few still may be seen in conservative\r\ncommunities in the New England states and in New York or Pennsylvania. I\r\nsaw flourishing ones this summer in Gloucester, Marblehead, and Ipswich.\r\nEven where the front yard was but a narrow strip of land before a tiny\r\ncottage, it was carefully fenced in, with a gate that was kept rigidly\r\nclosed and latched. There seemed to be a law which shaped and bounded\r\nthe front yard; the side fences extended from the corners of the house\r\nto the front fence on the edge of the road, and thus formed naturally\r\nthe guarded parallelogram. Often the fence around the front yard was the\r\nonly one on the farm; everywhere else were boundaries of great stone\r\nwalls; or if there were rail fences, the front yard fence was the only\r\npainted one. I cannot doubt that the first gardens that our foremothers\r\nhad, which were wholly of flowering plants, were front yards, little\r\nenclosures hard won from the forest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Flowering Almond under the Window.]\r\n\r\nThe word yard, not generally applied now to any enclosure of elegant\r\ncultivation, comes from the same root as the word garden. Garth is\r\nanother derivative, and the word exists much disguised in orchard. In\r\nthe sixteenth century yard was used in formal literature instead of\r\ngarden; and later Burns writes of \"Eden's bonnie yard, Where yeuthful\r\nlovers first were pair'd.\"\r\n\r\nThis front yard was an English fashion derived from the forecourt so\r\nstrongly advised by Gervayse Markham (an interesting old English writer\r\non floriculture and husbandry), and found in front of many a yeoman's\r\nhouse, and many a more pretentious house as well in Markham's day.\r\nForecourts were common in England until the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and may still be seen. The forecourt gave privacy to the house\r\neven when in the centre of a town. Its readoption is advised with\r\nhandsome dwellings in England, where ground-space is limited,--and why\r\nnot in America, too?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Peter's Wreath.]\r\n\r\nThe front yard was sacred to the best beloved, or at any rate the most\r\nhonored, garden flowers of the house mistress, and was preserved by its\r\nfences from inroads of cattle, which then wandered at their will and\r\nwere not housed, or even enclosed at night. The flowers were often of\r\nscant variety, but were those deemed the gentlefolk of the flower world.\r\nThere was a clump of Daffodils and of the Poet's Narcissus in early\r\nspring, and stately Crown Imperial; usually, too, a few scarlet and\r\nyellow single Tulips, and Grape Hyacinths. Later came Phlox in\r\nabundance--the only native American plant,--Canterbury Bells, and ample\r\nand glowing London Pride. Of course there were great plants of white and\r\nblue Day Lilies, with their beautiful and decorative leaves, and purple\r\nand yellow Flower de Luce. A few old-fashioned shrubs always were seen.\r\nBy inflexible law there must be a Lilac, which might be the aristocratic\r\nPersian Lilac. A Syringa, a flowering Currant, or Strawberry bush made\r\nsweet the front yard in spring, and sent wafts of fragrance into the\r\nhouse-windows. Spindling, rusty Snowberry bushes were by the gate, and\r\nSnowballs also, or our native Viburnums. Old as they seem, the Spiraeas\r\nand Deutzias came to us in the nineteenth century from Japan; as did the\r\nflowering Quinces and Cherries. The pink Flowering Almond dates back to\r\nthe oldest front yards (see page 39), and Peter's Wreath certainly seems\r\nan old settler and is found now in many front yards that remain. The\r\nlovely full-flowered shrub of Peter's Wreath, on page 41, which was\r\nphotographed for this book, was all that remained of a once-loved front\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nThe glory of the front yard was the old-fashioned early red \"Piny,\"\r\ncultivated since the days of Pliny. I hear people speaking of it with\r\ncontempt as a vulgar flower,--flaunting is the conventional derogatory\r\nadjective,--but I glory in its flaunting. The modern varieties, of every\r\ntint from white through flesh color, coral, pink, ruby color, salmon,\r\nand even yellow, to deep red, are as beautiful as Roses. Some are\r\nsweet-scented; and they have no thorns, and their foliage is ever\r\nperfect, so I am sure the Rose is jealous.\r\n\r\nI am as fond of the Peony as are the Chinese, among whom it is flower\r\nqueen. It is by them regarded as an aristocratic flower; and in old New\r\nEngland towns fine Peony plants in an old garden are a pretty good\r\nindication of the residence of what Dr. Holmes called New England\r\nBrahmins. In Salem and Portsmouth are old \"Pinys\" that have a hundred\r\nblossoms at a time--a glorious sight. A Japanese name is\r\n\"Flower-of-prosperity\"; another name, \"Plant-of-twenty-days,\" because\r\nits glories last during that period of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Peonies in a Salem Garden.]\r\n\r\nRhododendrons are to the modern garden what the Peony was in the\r\nold-fashioned flower border; and I am glad the modern flower cannot\r\ndrive the old one out. They are equally varied in coloring, but the\r\nPeony is a much hardier plant, and I like it far better. It has no\r\nblights, no bugs, no diseases, no running out, no funguses; it\r\ndoesn't have to be covered in winter, and it will bloom in the shade. No\r\nold-time or modern garden is to me fully furnished without Peonies; see\r\nhow fair they are in this Salem garden. I would grow them in some corner\r\nof the garden for their splendid healthy foliage if they hadn't a\r\nblossom. The _Paeonia tenuifolia_ in particular has exquisite feathery\r\nfoliage. The great Tree Peony, which came from China, grows eight feet\r\nor more in height, and is a triumph of the flower world; but it was not\r\nknown to the oldest front yards. Some of the Tree Peonies have finely\r\ndisplayed leafage of a curious and very gratifying tint of green. Miss\r\nJekyll, with her usual felicity, compares its blue cast with pinkish\r\nshading to the vari-colored metal alloys of the Japanese bronze\r\nworkers--a striking comparison. The single Peonies of recent years are\r\nof great beauty, and will soon be esteemed here as in China.\r\n\r\nNot the least of the Peony's charms is its exceeding trimness and\r\ncleanliness. The plants always look like a well-dressed, well-shod,\r\nwell-gloved girl of birth, breeding, and of equal good taste and good\r\nhealth; a girl who can swim, and skate, and ride, and play golf. Every\r\ninch has a well-set, neat, cared-for look which the shape and growth of\r\nthe plant keeps from seeming artificial or finicky. See the white Peony\r\non page 44; is it not a seemly, comely thing, as well as a beautiful\r\none?\r\n\r\nNo flower can be set in our garden of more distinct antiquity than the\r\nPeony; the Greeks believed it to be of divine origin. A green arbor of\r\nthe fourteenth century in England is described as set around with\r\nGillyflower, Tansy, Gromwell, and \"Pyonys powdered ay betwene\"--just as\r\nI like to see Peonies set to this day, \"powdered\" everywhere between all\r\nthe other flowers of the border.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White Peonies.]\r\n\r\nI am pleased to note of the common flowers of the New England front\r\nyard, that they are no new things; they are nearly all Elizabethan of\r\ndate--many are older still. Lord Bacon in his essay on gardens names\r\nmany of them, Crocus, Tulip, Hyacinth, Daffodil, Flower de Luce, double\r\nPeony, Lilac, Lily of the Valley.\r\n\r\nA favorite flower was the yellow garden Lily, the Lemon Lily,\r\n_Hemerocallis_, when it could be kept from spreading. Often its\r\nunbounded luxuriance exiled it from the front yard to the kitchen\r\ndooryard as befell the clump shown facing page 48. Its pretty\r\nold-fashioned name was Liricon-fancy, given, I am told, in England to\r\nthe Lily of the Valley. I know no more satisfying sight than a good bank\r\nof these Lemon Lilies in full flower. Below Flatbush there used to be a\r\ndriveway leading to an old Dutch house, set at regular intervals with\r\ngreat clumps of Lemon Lilies, and their full bloom made them glorious.\r\nTheir power of satisfactory adaptation in our modern formal garden is\r\nhappily shown facing page 76, in the lovely garden of Charles E. Mather,\r\nEsq., in Haverford, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe time of fullest inflorescence of the nineteenth century front yard\r\nwas when Phlox and Tiger Lilies bloomed; but the pinkish-orange colors\r\nof the latter (the oddest reds of any flower tints) blended most vilely\r\nand rampantly with the crimson-purple of the Phlox; and when London\r\nPride joined with its glowing scarlet, the front yard fairly ached.\r\nNevertheless, an adaptation of that front yard bloom can be most\r\neffective in a garden border, when white Phlox only is planted, and the\r\nTiger Lily or cultivated stalks of our wild nodding Lily rise above the\r\nwhite trusses of bloom. These wild Lilies grow very luxuriantly in the\r\ngarden, often towering above our heads and forming great candelabra\r\nbearing two score or more blooms. It is no easy task to secure their\r\ndeep-rooted rhizomes in the meadow. I know a young man who won his\r\nsweetheart by the patience and assiduity with which he dug for her all\r\none broiling morning to secure for her the coveted Lily roots, and\r\ncollapsed with mild sunstroke at the finish. Her gratitude and remorse\r\nwere equal factors in his favor.\r\n\r\nThe Tiger Lily is usually thought upon as a truly old-fashioned flower,\r\na veritable antique; it is a favorite of artists to place as an\r\naccessory in their colonial gardens, and of authors for their\r\nflower-beds of Revolutionary days, but it was not known either in formal\r\ngarden or front yard, until after \"the days when we lived under the\r\nKing.\" The bulbs were first brought to England from Eastern Asia in 1804\r\nby Captain Kirkpatrick of the East India Company's Service, and shared\r\nwith the Japan Lily the honor of being the first Eastern Lilies\r\nintroduced into European gardens. A few years ago an old gentleman, Mr.\r\nIsaac Pitman, who was then about eighty-five years of age, told me that\r\nhe recalled distinctly when Tiger Lilies first appeared in our gardens,\r\nand where he first saw them growing in Boston. So instead of being an\r\nold-time flower, or even an old-comer from the Orient, it is one of the\r\nnovelties of this century. How readily has it made itself at home, and\r\neven wandered wild down our roadsides!\r\n\r\nThe two simple colors of Phlox of the old-time front yard, white and\r\ncrimson-purple, are now augmented by tints of salmon, vermilion, and\r\nrose. I recall with special pleasure the profuse garden decoration at\r\nEast Hampton, Long Island, of a pure cherry-colored Phlox, generally a\r\ndoubtful color to me, but there so associated with the white blooms of\r\nvarious other plants, and backed by a high hedge covered solidly with\r\nblossoming Honeysuckle, that it was wonderfully successful.\r\n\r\nTo other members of the Phlox family, all natives of our own continent,\r\nthe old front yard owed much; the Moss Pink sometimes crowded out both\r\nGrass and its companion the Periwinkle; it is still found in our\r\ngardens, and bountifully also in our fields; either in white or pink, it\r\nis one of the satisfactions of spring, and its cheerful little blossom\r\nis of wonderful use in many waste places. An old-fashioned bloom, the\r\nlow-growing _Phlox amoena_, with its queerly fuzzy leaves and bright\r\ncrimson blossoms, was among the most distinctly old-fashioned flowers of\r\nthe front yard. It was tolerated rather than cultivated, as was its\r\ncompanion, the Arabis or Rock Cress--both crowding, monopolizing\r\ncreatures. I remember well how they spread over the beds and up the\r\ngrass banks in my mother's garden, how sternly they were uprooted, in\r\nspite of the pretty name of the Arabis--\"Snow in Summer.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes the front yard path had edgings of sweet single or lightly\r\ndouble white or tinted Pinks, which were not deemed as choice as Box\r\nedgings. Frequently large Box plants clipped into simple and natural\r\nshapes stood at the side of the doorstep, usually in the home of the\r\nwell-to-do. A great shell might be on either side of the door-sill, if\r\nthere chanced to be seafaring men-folk who lived or visited under the\r\nroof-tree. Annuals were few in number; sturdy old perennial plants of\r\nmany years' growth were the most honored dwellers in the front yard,\r\ntrue representatives of old families. The Roses were few and poor, for\r\nthere was usually some great tree just without the gate, an Elm or\r\nLarch, whose shadow fell far too near and heavily for the health of\r\nRoses. Sometimes there was a prickly semidouble yellow Rose, called by\r\nus a Scotch Rose, a Sweet Brier, or a rusty-flowered white Rose,\r\nsimilar, though inferior, to the Madame Plantier. A new fashion of\r\ntrellises appeared in the front yard about sixty years ago, and crimson\r\nBoursault Roses climbed up them as if by magic.\r\n\r\nOne marked characteristic of the front yard was its lack of weeds; few\r\nsprung up, none came to seed-time; the enclosure was small, and it was a\r\nmark of good breeding to care for it well. Sometimes, however, the earth\r\nwas covered closely under shrubs and plants with the cheerful little\r\nLadies' Delights, and they blossomed in the chinks of the bricked path\r\nand under the Box edges. Ambrosia, too, grew everywhere, but these were\r\nwelcome--they were not weeds.\r\n\r\nOur old New England houses were suited in color and outline to their\r\nfront yards as to our landscape. Lowell has given in verse a good\r\ndescription of the kind of New England house that always had a front\r\ndooryard of flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yellow Day Lilies.]\r\n\r\n                        \"On a grass-green swell\r\n    That towards the south with sweet concessions fell,\r\n    It dwelt retired, and half had grown to be\r\n    As aboriginal as rock or tree.\r\n    It nestled close to earth, and seemed to brood\r\n    O'er homely thoughts in a half-conscious mood.\r\n    If paint it e'er had known, it knew no more\r\n    Than yellow lichens spattered thickly o'er\r\n    That soft lead gray, less dark beneath the eaves,\r\n    Which the slow brush of wind and weather leaves.\r\n    The ample roof sloped backward to the ground\r\n    And vassal lean-tos gathered thickly round,\r\n    Patched on, as sire or son had felt the need.\r\n    But the great chimney was the central thought.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    It rose broad-shouldered, kindly, debonair,\r\n    Its warm breath whitening in the autumn air.\"\r\n\r\nSarah Orne Jewett, in the plaint of _A Mournful Villager_, has drawn a\r\nbeautiful and sympathetic picture of these front yards, and she deplores\r\ntheir passing. I mourn them as I do every fenced-in or hedged-in garden\r\nenclosure. The sanctity and reserve of these front yards of our\r\ngrandmothers was somewhat emblematic of woman's life of that day: it was\r\nrestricted, and narrowed to a small outlook and monotonous likeness to\r\nher neighbor's; but it was a life easily satisfied with small pleasures,\r\nand it was comely and sheltered and carefully kept, and pleasant to the\r\nhome household; and these were no mean things.\r\n\r\nThe front yard was never a garden of pleasure; children could not play\r\nin these precious little enclosed plots, and never could pick the\r\nflowers--front yard and flowers were both too much respected. Only\r\nformal visitors entered therein, visitors who opened the gate and closed\r\nit carefully behind them, and knocked slowly with the brass knocker, and\r\nwere ushered in through the ceremonious front door and the little\r\nill-contrived entry, to the stiff fore-room or parlor. The parson and\r\nhis wife entered that portal, and sometimes a solemn would-be\r\nsweetheart, or the guests at a tea party. It can be seen that every one\r\nwho had enough social dignity to have a front door and a parlor, and\r\nvisitors thereto, also desired a front yard with flowers as the external\r\ntoken of that honored standing. It was like owning a pew in church; you\r\ncould be a Christian without having a pew, but not a respected one.\r\nSometimes when there was a \"vendue\" in the house, reckless folk opened\r\nthe front gate, and even tied it back. I attended one where the\r\nauctioneer boldly set the articles out through the windows under the\r\nLilac bushes and even on the precious front yard plants. A vendue and a\r\nfuneral were the only gatherings in country communities when the entire\r\nneighborhood came freely to an old homestead, when all were at liberty\r\nto enter the front dooryard. At the sad time when a funeral took place\r\nin the house, the front gate was fastened widely open, and solemn\r\nmen-neighbors, in Sunday garments, stood rather uncomfortably and\r\nawkwardly around the front yard as the women passed into the house of\r\nmourning and were seated within. When the sad services began, the men\r\ntoo entered and stood stiffly by the door. Then through the front door,\r\ndown the mossy path of the front yard, and through the open front gate\r\nwas borne the master, the mistress, and then their children, and\r\nchildren's children. All are gone from our sight, many from our memory,\r\nand often too from our ken, while the Lilacs and Peonies and Flowers de\r\nLuce still blossom and flourish with perennial youth, and still claim us\r\nas friends.\r\n\r\nAt the side of the house or by the kitchen door would be seen many\r\nthrifty blooms: poles of Scarlet Runners, beds of Portulacas and\r\nPetunias, rows of Pinks, bunches of Marigolds, level expanses of Sweet\r\nWilliams, banks of cheerful Nasturtiums, tangles of Morning-glories and\r\nlong rows of stately Hollyhocks, which were much admired, but were\r\nseldom seen in the front yard, which was too shaded for them. Weeds grew\r\nhere at the kitchen door in a rank profusion which was hard to conquer;\r\nbut here the winter's Fuchsias or Geraniums stood in flower pots in the\r\nsunlight, and the tubs of Oleanders and Agapanthus Lilies.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the front yard seemed to bear a more formal, a \"company\"\r\naspect; conventionality rigidly bound them. Bachelor's Buttons might\r\ngrow there by accident, but Marigolds never were tolerated,--they were\r\npot herbs. Sunflowers were not even permitted in the flower beds at the\r\nside of the house unless these stretched down to the vegetable beds.\r\nOutside the front yard would be a rioting and cheerful growth of pink\r\nBouncing Bet, or of purple Honesty, and tall straggling plants of a\r\ncertain small flowered, ragged Campanula, and a white Mallow with\r\nflannelly leaves which, doubtless, aspired to inhabit the sacred bounds\r\nof the front yard (and probably dwelt there originally), and often were\r\ngladly permitted to grow in side gardens or kitchen dooryards, but which\r\nwere regarded as interloping weeds by the guardians of the front yard,\r\nand sternly exiled. Sometimes a bed of these orange-tawny Day Lilies\r\nwhich had once been warmly welcomed from the Orient, and now were not\r\nwanted anywhere by any one, kept company with the Bouncing Bet, and\r\nstretched cheerfully down the roadside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Orange Day Lilies.]\r\n\r\nWhen the fences disappeared with the night rambles of the cows, the\r\nfront yards gradually changed character; the tender blooms vanished,\r\nbut the tall shrubs and the Peonies and Flower de Luce sturdily grew and\r\nblossomed, save where that dreary destroyer of a garden crept in--the\r\ndesire for a lawn. The result was then a meagre expanse of poorly kept\r\ngrass, with no variety, color, or change,--neither lawn nor front yard.\r\nIt is ever a pleasure to me when driving in a village street or a\r\ncountry road to find one of these front yards still enclosed, or even to\r\nnote in front of many houses the traces of a past front yard still\r\nplainly visible in the flourishing old-fashioned plants of many years'\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nVARIED GARDENS FAIR\r\n\r\n    \"And all without were walkes and alleys dight\r\n     With divers trees enrang'd in even rankes;\r\n     And here and there were pleasant arbors pight\r\n     And shadie seats, and sundry flowering bankes\r\n     To sit and rest the walkers wearie shankes.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Faerie Queene_, EDMUND SPENSER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany simple forms of gardens were common besides the enclosed front\r\nyard; and as wealth poured in on the colonies, the beautiful gardens so\r\nmuch thought of in England were copied here, especially by wealthy\r\nmerchants, as is noted in the first chapter of this book, and by the\r\nprovincial governors and their little courts; the garden of Governor\r\nHutchinson, in Milford, Massachusetts, is stately still and little\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Preston Garden.]\r\n\r\nEnglish gardens, at the time of the settlement of America, had passed\r\nbeyond the time when, as old Gervayse Markham said, \"Of all the best\r\nOrnaments used in our English gardens, Knots and Mazes are the most\r\nancient.\" A maze was a placing of low garden hedges of Privet, Box, or\r\nHyssop, usually set in concentric circles which enclosed paths, that\r\nopened into each other by such artful contrivance that it was difficult\r\nto find one's way in and out through these bewildering paths. \"When well\r\nformed, of a man's height, your friend may perhaps wander in gathering\r\nberries as he cannot recover himself without your help.\"\r\n\r\nThe maze was not a thing of beauty, it was \"nothing for sweetness and\r\nhealth,\" to use Lord Bacon's words; it was only a whimsical notion of\r\ngardening amusement, pleasing to a generation who liked to have hidden\r\nfountains in their gardens to sprinkle suddenly the unwary. I doubt if\r\nany mazes were ever laid out in America, though I have heard vague\r\nreferences to one in Virginia. Knots had been the choice adornment of\r\nthe Tudor garden. They were not wholly a thing of the past when we had\r\nhere our first gardens, and they have had a distinct influence on garden\r\nlaying-out till our own day.\r\n\r\nAn Elizabethan poet wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Garden sweet, enclosed with walles strong,\r\n     Embanked with benches to sitt and take my rest;\r\n     The knots so enknotted it cannot be expressed\r\n     The arbores and alyes so pleasant and so dulce.\"\r\n\r\nThese garden knots were not flower beds edged with Box or Rosemary, with\r\nnarrow walks between the edgings, as were the parterres of our later\r\nformal gardens. They were square, ornamental beds, each of which had a\r\ndesign set in some close-growing, trim plant, clipped flatly across the\r\ntop, and the design filled in with colored earth or sand; and with no\r\ndividing paths. Elaborate models in complicated geometrical pattern were\r\ngiven in gardeners' books, for setting out these knots, which were first\r\ndrawn on paper and subdivided into squares; then the square of earth was\r\nsimilarly divided, and set out by precise rules. William Lawson, the\r\nIzaak Walton of gardeners, gave, as a result of forty-eight years of\r\nexperience, some very attractive directions for large \"knottys\" with\r\ndifferent \"thrids\" of flowers, each of one color, which made the design\r\nappear as if \"made of diverse colored ribands.\" One of his knots, from\r\n_A New Orchard and Garden_ 1618, being a garden fashion in vogue when my\r\nforbears came to America, I have chosen as a device for the dedication\r\nof this book, thinking it, in Lawson's words, \"so comely, and orderly\r\nplaced, and so intermingled, that one looking thereon cannot but\r\nwonder.\" His knots had significant names, such as \"Cinkfoyle; Flower de\r\nLuce; Trefoyle; Frette; Lozenge; Groseboowe; Diamond; Ovall; Maze.\"\r\n\r\nGervayse Markham gives various knot patterns to be bordered with Box cut\r\neighteen inches broad at the bottom and kept flat at the top--with the\r\never present thought for the fine English linen. He has a varied list of\r\ncircular, diamond-shaped, mixed, and \"single impleated knots.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box-edged Parterre at Hampton.]\r\n\r\nThese garden knots were mildly sneered at by Lord Bacon; he said, \"they\r\nbe but toys, you see as good sights many times in tarts;\" still I think\r\nthey must have been quaint, and I should like to see a garden laid out\r\nto-day in these pretty Elizabethan knots, set in the old patterns, and\r\nwith the old flowers. Nor did Parkinson and other practical gardeners\r\nlook with favor on \"curiously knotted gardens,\" though all gave designs\r\nto \"satisfy the desires\" of their readers. \"Open knots\" were preferred;\r\nthese were made with borders of lead, tiles, boards, or even the\r\nshankbones of sheep, \"which will become white and prettily grace out the\r\ngarden,\"--a fashion I saw a few years ago around flower beds in\r\nCharlton, Massachusetts. \"Round whitish pebble stones\" for edgings were\r\nParkinson's own invention, and proud he was of it, simple as it seems to\r\nus. These open knots were then filled in, but \"thin and sparingly,\" with\r\n\"English Flowers\"; or with \"Out-Landish Flowers,\" which were flowers\r\nfetched from foreign parts.\r\n\r\nThe parterre succeeded the knot, and has been used in gardens till the\r\npresent day. Parterres were of different combinations, \"well-contriv'd\r\nand ingenious.\" The \"parterre of cut-work\" was a Box-bordered formal\r\nflower garden, of which the garden at Hampton, Maryland (pages 57, 60,\r\nand 95), is a striking and perfect example; also the present garden at\r\nMount Vernon (opposite page 12), wherein carefully designed flower beds,\r\nedged with Box, are planted with variety of flowers, and separated by\r\npaths. Sometimes, of old, fine white sand was carefully strewn on the\r\nearth under the flowers. The \"parterre a l'Anglaise\" had an elaborate\r\ndesign of vari-shaped beds edged with Box, but enclosing grass instead\r\nof flowers. In the \"parterre de broderie\" the Box-edged beds were filled\r\nwith vari-colored earths and sands. Black earth could be made of iron\r\nfilings; red earth of pounded tiles. This last-named parterre differed\r\nfrom a knot solely in having the paths among the beds. The _Retir'd\r\nGard'ner_ gives patterns for ten parterres.\r\n\r\nThe main walks which formed the basis of the garden design had in\r\nancient days a singular name--forthrights; these were ever to be\r\n\"spacious and fair,\" and neatly spread with colored sands or gravel.\r\nParkinson says, \"The fairer and larger your allies and walks be the more\r\ngrace your garden should have, the lesse harm the herbes and flowers\r\nshall receive, and the better shall your weeders cleanse both the bed\r\nand the allies.\" \"Covert-walks,\" or \"shade-alleys,\" had trees meeting in\r\nan arch over them.\r\n\r\nA curious term, found in references to old American flower beds and\r\ngarden designs, as well as English ones, is the \"goose-foot.\" A\r\n\"goose-foot\" consisted of three flower beds or three avenues radiating\r\nrather closely together from a small semicircle; and in some places and\r\nunder some conditions it is still a charming and striking design, as you\r\nstand at the heel of the design and glance down the three avenues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parterre and Clipped Box at Hampton.]\r\n\r\nIn all these flower beds Box was the favorite edging, but many other\r\ntrim edgings have been used in parterres and borders by those who love\r\nnot Box. Bricks were used, and boards; an edging of boards was not as\r\npretty as one of flowers, but it kept the beds trimly in place; a garden\r\nthus edged is shown on page 63 which realizes this description of the\r\npleasure-garden in the _Scots Gard'ner_: \"The Bordures box'd and planted\r\nwith variety of fine Flowers orderly Intermixt, Weeded, Mow'd, Rolled\r\nand Kept all Clean and Handsome.\" Germander and Rosemary were old\r\nfavorites for edging. I have seen snowy edgings of Candy-tuft and Sweet\r\nAlyssum, setting off well the vari-colored blooms of the border. One of\r\nSweet Alyssum is shown on page 256. Ageratum is a satisfactory edging.\r\nThyme is of ancient use, but rather unmanageable; one garden owner has\r\nset his edgings of Moneywort, otherwise Creeping-jenny. I should be loth\r\nto use Moneywort as an edging; I would not care for its yellow flowers\r\nin that place, though I find them very kindly and cheerful on dull banks\r\nor in damp spots, under the drip of trees and eaves, or better still,\r\ngrowing gladly in the flower pot of the poor. I fear if Moneywort\r\nthrived enough to make a close, suitable edging, that it would thrive\r\ntoo well, and would swamp the borders with its underground runners. The\r\nname Moneywort is akin to its older title Herb-twopence, or Twopenny\r\nGrass. Turner (1548) says the latter name was given from the leaves all\r\n\"standying together of ech syde of the stalke lyke pence.\" The striped\r\nleaves of one variety of Day Lily make pretty edgings. Those from a\r\nSalem garden are here shown.\r\n\r\nWe often see in neglected gardens in New England, or by the roadside\r\nwhere no gardens now exist, a dense gray-green growth of Lavender\r\nCotton, \"the female plant of Southernwood,\" which was brought here by\r\nthe colonists and here will ever remain. It was used as an edging, and\r\nis very pretty when it can be controlled. I know two or three old\r\ngardens where it is thus employed.\r\n\r\nSometimes in driving along a country road you are startled by a\r\nconcentration of foliage and bloom, a glimpse of a tiny farm-house, over\r\nwhich are clustered and heaped, and round which are gathered, close\r\nenough to be within touch from door or window, flowers in a crowded\r\nprofusion ample to fill a large flower bed. Such is the mass of June\r\nbloom at Wilbur Farm in old Narragansett (page 290)--a home of flowers\r\nand bees. Often by the side of the farm-house is a little garden or\r\nflower bed containing some splendid examples of old-time flowers. The\r\nsplendid \"running ribbons\" of Snow Pinks, on page 292, are in another\r\nNarragansett garden that is a bower of blossoms. Thrift has been a\r\ncommon edging since the days of the old herbalist Gerarde.\r\n\r\n    \"We have a bright little garden, down on a sunny slope,\r\n     Bordered with sea-pinks and sweet with the songs and blossoms of\r\n       hope.\"\r\n\r\nThe garden of Secretary William H. Seward (in Auburn, New York), so\r\nbeloved by him in his lifetime, is shown on page 146 and facing page\r\n134. In this garden some beds are edged with Periwinkle, others with\r\nPolyanthus, and some with Ivy which Mr. Seward brought from Abbotsford\r\nin 1836. This garden was laid out in its present form in 1816, and the\r\nsun-dial was then set in its place. The garden has been enlarged, but\r\nnot changed, the old \"George II. Roses\" and York and Lancaster Roses\r\nstill grow and blossom, and the lovely arches of single Michigan Roses\r\nstill flourish. In it are many flowers and fruits unusual in America,\r\namong them a bed of Alpine strawberries.\r\n\r\nKing James I. of Scotland thus wrote of the garden which he saw from his\r\nprison window in Windsor Castle:--\r\n\r\n    \"A Garden fair, and in the Corners set\r\n     An Herbere greene, with Wandis long and small\r\n     Railit about.\"\r\n\r\nThese wandis were railings which were much used before Box edgings\r\nbecame universal. Sometimes they were painted the family colors, as at\r\nHampton Court they were green and white, the Tudor colors. These\r\n\"wandis\" still are occasionally seen. In the Berkshire Hills I drove\r\npast an old garden thus trimly enclosed in little beds. The rails were\r\npainted a dull light brown, almost the color of some tree trunks; and\r\nLarkspur, Foxglove, and other tall flowers crowded up to them and hung\r\ntheir heads over the top rails as children hang over a fence or a gate.\r\nI thought it a neat, trim fashion, not one I would care for in my own\r\ngarden, yet not to be despised in the garden of another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden of Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright, Waldstein, Fairfield,\r\nConn.]\r\n\r\nA garden enclosed! so full of suggestion are these simple words to me,\r\nso constant is my thought that an ideal flower garden must be an\r\nenclosed garden, that I look with regret upon all beautiful flower beds\r\nthat are not enclosed, not shut in a frame of green hedges, or high\r\nwalls, or vine-covered fences and dividing trees. It may be selfish to\r\nhide so much beauty from general view; but until our dwelling-houses are\r\nmade with uncurtained glass walls, that all the world may see\r\neverything, let those who have ample grounds enclose at least a portion\r\nfor the sight of friends only.\r\n\r\nIn the heart of Worcester there is a fine old mansion with ample lawns,\r\ngreat trees, and flowering shrubs that all may see over the garden fence\r\nas they pass by. Flowers bloom lavishly at one side of the house; and\r\nthe thoughtless stroller never knows that behind the house, stretching\r\ndown between the rear gardens and walls of neighboring homes, is a long\r\nenclosure of loveliness--sequestered, quiet, full of refreshment to the\r\nspirits. We think of the \"Old Garden\" of Margaret Deland:--\r\n\r\n                          \"The Garden glows\r\n    And 'gainst its walls the city's heart still beats.\r\n    And out from it each summer wind that blows\r\n    Carries some sweetness to the tired streets!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shaded Walk in Garden of Miss Harriet P. F. Burnside,\r\nWorcester, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nThere is a shaded walk in this garden which is a thing of solace and\r\ncontent to all who tread its pathway; a bit is shown opposite this page,\r\noverhung with shrubs of Lilac, Syringa, Strawberry Bush, Flowering\r\nCurrant, all the old treelike things, so fair-flowered and sweet-scented\r\nin spring, so heavy-leaved and cool-shadowing in midsummer: what\r\npleasure would there be in this shaded walk if this garden were\r\nseparated from the street only by stone curbing or a low rail? And there\r\nis an old sun-dial too in this enclosed garden! I fear the street imps\r\nof a crowded city would quickly destroy the old monitor were it in an\r\nopen garden; and they would make sad havoc, too, of the Roses and\r\nLarkspurs (page 65) so tenderly reared by the two sisters who\r\ntogether loved and cared for this \"garden enclosed.\" Great trees are at\r\nthe edges of this garden, and the line of tall shrubs is carried out by\r\nthe lavish vines and Roses on fences and walls. Within all this border\r\nof greenery glow the clustered gems of rare and beautiful flowers, till\r\nthe whole garden seems like some rich jewel set purposely to be worn in\r\nhonor over the city's heart--a clustered jewel, not one to be displayed\r\ncarelessly and heedlessly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roses and Larkspur in the Garden of Miss Harriet P. F.\r\nBurnside, Worcester, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nSalem houses and gardens are like Salem people. Salem houses present to\r\nyou a serene and dignified front, gracious yet reserved, not thrusting\r\nforward their choicest treasures to the eyes of passing strangers; but\r\nbehind the walls of the houses, enclosed from public view, lie cherished\r\ngardens, full of the beauty of life. Such, in their kind, are Salem\r\nfolk.\r\n\r\nI know no more speaking, though silent, criticism than those old Salem\r\ngardens afford upon the modern fashion in American towns of pulling down\r\nwalls and fences, removing the boundaries of lawns, and living in full\r\nview of every passer-by, in a public grassy park. It is pleasant, I\r\nsuppose, for the passer-by; but homes are not made for passers-by. Old\r\nSalem gardens lie behind the house, out of sight--you have to hunt for\r\nthem. They are terraced down if they stretch to the water-side; they are\r\nenclosed with hedges, and set behind high vine-covered fences, and low\r\nout-buildings; and planted around with great trees: thus they give to\r\neach family that secluded centring of family life which is the very\r\nessence and being of a home. I sat through a June afternoon in a Salem\r\ngarden whose gate is within a stone's throw of a great theatre, but a\r\nfew hundred feet from lines of electric cars and a busy street of trade,\r\nscarce farther from lines of active steam cars, and with a great power\r\nhouse for a close neighbor. Yet we were as secluded, as embowered in\r\nvines and trees, with beehives and rabbit hutches and chicken coops for\r\nhappy children at the garden's end, as truly in beautiful privacy, as if\r\nin the midst of a hundred acres. Could the sense of sound be as\r\nsheltered by the enclosing walls as the sense of sight, such a garden\r\nwere a city paradise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Homely Back Yard.]\r\n\r\nThere is scant regularity in shape in Salem gardens; there is no search\r\nfor exact dimensions. Little narrow strips of flower beds run down from\r\nthe main garden in any direction or at any angle where the fortunate\r\nowner can buy a few feet of land. Salem gardens do not change with the\r\nwhims of fancy, either in the shape or the planting. A few new flowers\r\nfind place there, such as the _Anemone Japonica_ and the Japanese\r\nshrubs; for they are akin in flower sentiment, and consort well with the\r\nold inhabitants. There are many choice flowers and fruits in these\r\ngardens. In the garden of the Manning homestead (opposite page 112)\r\ngrows a flourishing Fig tree, and other rare fruits; for fifty years ago\r\nthis garden was known as the Pomological Garden. It is fitting it should\r\nbe the home of two Robert Mannings--both well-known names in the history\r\nof horticulture in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Covered Well at Home of Bishop Berkeley, Whitehall, Rhode\r\nIsland.]\r\n\r\nThe homely back yard of an old house will often possess a trim and\r\nblooming flower border cutting off the close approach of the vegetable\r\nbeds (see opposite page 66). These back yards, with the covered Grape\r\narbors, the old pumps, and bricked paths, are cheerful, wholesome\r\nplaces, generally of spotless cleanliness and weedless flower beds. I\r\nknow one such back yard where the pump was the first one set in the\r\ntown, and children were taken there from a distance to see the wondrous\r\nsight. Why are all the old appliances for raising water so pleasing? A\r\nwell-sweep is of course picturesque, with its long swinging pole, and\r\nyou seem to feel the refreshment and purity of the water when you see it\r\nbrought up from such a distance; and an old roofed well with bucket,\r\nsuch as this one still in use at Bishop Berkeley's Rhode Island home is\r\never a homelike and companionable object. But a pump is really an\r\nawkward-looking piece of mechanism, and hasn't a vestige of beauty in\r\nits lines; yet it has something satisfying about it; it may be its\r\ndomesticity, its homeliness, its simplicity. We have gained infinitely\r\nin comfort in our perfect water systems and lavish water of to-day, but\r\nwe have lost the gratification of the senses which came from the sight\r\nand sound of freshly drawn or running water. Much of the delight in a\r\nfountain comes, not only from the beauty of its setting and the graceful\r\nshape of its jets, but simply from the sight of the water.\r\n\r\nSometimes a graceful and picturesque growth of vines will beautify gate\r\nposts, a fence, or a kitchen doorway in a wonderfully artistic and\r\npleasing fashion. On page 70 is shown the sheltered doorway of the\r\nkitchen of a fine old stone farm-house called, from its hedges of Osage\r\nOrange, \"The Hedges.\" It stands in the village of New Hope, County\r\nBucks, Pennsylvania. In 1718 the tract of which this farm of over two\r\nhundred acres is but a portion was deeded by the Penns to their kinsman,\r\nthe direct ancestor of the present owner, John Schofield Williams, Esq.\r\nThis is but one of the scores of examples I know where the same estate\r\nhas been owned in one family for nearly two centuries, sometimes even\r\nfor two hundred and fifty years; and in several cases where the deed\r\nfrom the Indian sachem to the first colonist is the only deed there has\r\never been, the estate having never changed ownership save by direct\r\nbequest. I have three such cases among my own kinsfolk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kitchen Doorway and Porch at the Hedges.]\r\n\r\nAnother form of garden and mode of planting which was in vogue in the\r\n\"early thirties\" is shown facing page 92. This pillared house and the\r\nstiff garden are excellent types; they are at Napanock, County Ulster,\r\nNew York. Such a house and grounds indicated the possession of\r\nconsiderable wealth when they were built and laid out, for both were\r\ncostly. The semicircular driveway swept up to the front door, dividing\r\noff Box-edged parterres like those of the day of Queen Anne. These\r\nparterres were sparsely filled, the sunnier beds being set with Spring\r\nbulbs; and there were always the yellow Day Lilies somewhere in the\r\nflower beds, and the white and blue Day Lilies, the common Funkias.\r\nFormal urns were usually found in the parterres and sometimes a great\r\ncone or ball of clipped Box. These gardens had some universal details,\r\nthey always had great Snowball bushes, and Syringas, and usually white\r\nRoses, chiefly Madame Plantiers; the piazza trellises had old climbing\r\nRoses, the Queen of the Prairie or Boursault Roses. These gardens are\r\noften densely overshadowed with great evergreen trees grown from the\r\ncrowded planting of seventy years ago; none are cut down, and if one\r\ndies its trunk still stands, entwined with Woodbine. I don't know that\r\nwe would lay out and plant just such a garden to-day, any more than we\r\nwould build exactly such a house; but I love to see both, types of the\r\nrefinement of their day, and I deplore any changes. An old Southern\r\nhouse of allied form is shown on page 72, and its garden facing page\r\n70,--Greenwood, in Thomasville, Georgia; but of course this garden has\r\nfar more lavish and rich bloom. The decoration of this house is most\r\ninteresting--a conventionalized Magnolia, and the garden is surrounded\r\nwith splendid Magnolias and Crape Myrtles. The border edgings in this\r\ngarden are lines of bricks set overlapping in a curious manner. They\r\nserve to keep the beds firmly in place, and the bricks are covered over\r\nwith an inner edging of thrifty Violets. Curious tubs and boxes for\r\nplants are made of bricks set solidly in mortar. The garden is glorious\r\nwith Roses, which seem to consort so well with Magnolias and Violets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Greenwood, Thomasville, Georgia.]\r\n\r\nI love a Dutch garden, \"circummured\" with brick. By a Dutch garden, I\r\nmean a small garden, oblong or square, sunk about three or four feet in\r\na lawn--so that when surrounded by brick walls they seem about two feet\r\nhigh when viewed outside, but are five feet or more high from within the\r\ngarden. There are brick or stone steps in the middle of each of the four\r\nwalls by which to descend to the garden, which may be all planted with\r\nflowers, but preferably should have set borders of flowers with a\r\ngrass-plot in the centre. On either side of the steps should be brick\r\nposts surmounted by Dutch pots with plants, or by balls of stone.\r\nPlanted with bulbs, these gardens in their flowering time are, as old\r\nParkinson said, a \"perfect fielde of delite.\" We have very pretty Dutch\r\ngardens, so called, in America, but their chief claim to being Dutch is\r\nthat they are set with bulbs, and have Delft or other earthen pots or\r\nboxes for formal plants or shrubs.\r\n\r\nSunken gardens should be laid out under the supervision of an\r\nintelligent landscape architect; and even then should have a reason for\r\nbeing sunken other than a whim or increase in costliness. I visited last\r\nsummer a beautiful estate which had a deep sunken Dutch garden with a\r\nvery low wall. It lay at the right side of the house at a little\r\ndistance; and beyond it, in full view of the peristyle, extended the\r\nonly squalid objects in the horizon. A garden on the level, well\r\nplanted, with distant edging of shrubbery, would have hidden every ugly\r\nblemish and been a thing of beauty. As it is now, there can be seen from\r\nthe house nothing of the Dutch garden but a foot or two of the tops of\r\nseveral clipped trees, looking like very poor, stunted shrubs. I must\r\nadd that this garden, with its low wall, has been a perfect man-trap. It\r\nhas been evident that often, on dark nights, workmen who have sought a\r\n\"short cut\" across the grounds have fallen over the shallow wall, to the\r\ngardener's sorrow, and the bulbs' destruction. Once, at dawn, the\r\nunhappy gardener found an ancient horse peacefully feeding among the\r\nHyacinths and Tulips. He said he didn't like the grass in his new\r\npasture nor the sudden approach to it; that he was too old for such\r\nnew-fangled ways. I know another estate near Philadelphia, where the\r\nsinking of a garden revealed an exquisite view of distant hills; such a\r\ngarden has reason for its form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roses and Violets in Garden at Greenwood, Thomasville,\r\nGeorgia.]\r\n\r\nWe have had few water-gardens in America till recent years; and there\r\nare some drawbacks to their presence near our homes, as I was vividly\r\naware when I visited one in a friend's garden early in May this year.\r\nWater-hyacinths were even then in bloom, and two or three exquisite\r\nLilies; and the Lotus leaves rose up charmingly from the surface of the\r\ntank. Less charmingly rose up also a cloud of vicious mosquitoes, who\r\ngreeted the newcomer with a warm chorus of welcome. As our newspapers at\r\nthat time were filled with plans for the application of kerosene to\r\nevery inch of water-surface, such as I saw in these Lily tanks,\r\naccompanied by magnified drawings of dreadful malaria-bearing insects, I\r\nfled from them, preferring to resign both _Nymphaea_ and _Anopheles_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water Garden at Sylvester Manor, Shelter Island, New\r\nYork.]\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction to English folk of that wonder of the world, the\r\nVictoria Regia, it was cultivated by enthusiastic flower lovers in\r\nAmerica, and was for a time the height of the floral fashion. Never has\r\nthe glorious Victoria Regia and scarce any other flower been described\r\nas by Colonel Higginson, a wonderful, a triumphant word picture. I was a\r\nvery little child when I saw that same lovely Lily in leaf and flower\r\nthat he called his neighbor; but I have never forgotten it, nor how\r\nafraid I was of it; for some one wished to lift me upon the great leaf\r\nto see whether it would hold me above the water. We had heard that the\r\nnative children in South America floated on the leaves. I objected to\r\nthis experiment with vehemence; but my mother noted that I was no more\r\nfrightened than was the faithful gardener at the thought of the possible\r\nstrain on his precious plant of the weight of a sturdy child of six or\r\nseven years. I have seen the Victoria Regia leaves of late years, but\r\nI seldom hear of its blossoming; but alas! we take less heed of the\r\nblooming of unusual plants than we used to thirty or forty years ago.\r\nThen people thronged a greenhouse to see a new Rose or Camellia\r\nJaponica; even a Night-blooming Cereus attracted scores of visitors to\r\nany house where it blossomed. And a fine Cactus of one of our neighbors\r\nalways held a crowded reception when in rich bloom. It was a part of the\r\n\"Flower Exchange,\" an interest all had for the beautiful flowers of\r\nothers, a part of the old neighborly life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Terrace Wall at Drumthwacket, Princeton, New Jersey.]\r\n\r\nWithin the past five or six years there have been laid out in America,\r\nat the country seats of men of wealth and culture, a great number of\r\nformal gardens,--Italian gardens, some of them are worthily named, as\r\nthey have been shaped and planted in conformity with the best laws and\r\nrules of Italian garden-making--that special art. On this page is shown\r\nthe finely proportioned terrace wall, and opposite the upper terrace and\r\nformal garden of Drumthwacket, Princeton, New Jersey, the country seat\r\nof M. Taylor Pyne, Esq. This garden affords a good example of the accord\r\nwhich should ever exist between the garden and its surroundings. The\r\nname, Drumthwacket--a wooded hill--is a most felicitous one; the place\r\nis part of the original grant to William Penn, and has remained in the\r\npossession of one family until late in the nineteenth century. From this\r\nbeautifully wooded hill the terrace-garden overlooks the farm buildings,\r\nthe linked ponds, the fertile fields and meadows; a serene pastoral\r\nview, typical of the peaceful landscape of that vicinity--yet it was\r\nonce the scene of fiercest battle. For the Drumthwacket farm is the\r\nbattle-ground of that important encounter of 1777 between the British\r\nand the Continental troops, known as the Battle of Princeton, the\r\nturning point of the Revolution, in which Washington was victorious. To\r\nthis day, cannon ball and grape shot are dug up in the Drumthwacket\r\nfields. The Lodge built in 1696 was, at Washington's request, the\r\nshelter for the wounded British officers; and the Washington Spring in\r\nfront of the Lodge furnished water to Washington. The group of trees on\r\nthe left of the upper pond marks the sheltered and honored graves of the\r\nBritish soldiers, where have slept for one hundred and twenty-four\r\nyears those killed at this memorable encounter. If anything could cement\r\nstill more closely the affections of the English and American peoples,\r\nit would be the sight of the tenderly sheltered graves of British\r\nsoldiers in America, such as these at Drumthwacket and other historic\r\nfields on our Eastern coast. At Concord how faithfully stand the\r\nsentinel pines over the British dead of the Battle of Concord, who thus\r\nrepose, shut out from the tread of heedless feet yet ever present for\r\nthe care and thought of Concord people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden at Avonwood Court, Haverford, Pennsylvania,\r\nCountry-seat of Charles E. Mather, Esq.]\r\n\r\nWe have older Italian gardens. Some of them are of great loveliness,\r\namong them the unique and dignified garden of Hollis H. Hunnewell, Esq.,\r\nbut many of the newer ones, even in their few summers, have become of\r\nsurprising grace and beauty, and their exquisite promise causes a glow\r\nof delight to every garden lover. I have often tried to analyze and\r\naccount for the great charm of a formal garden, to one who loves so well\r\nthe unrestrained and lavished blossoming of a flower border crowded with\r\nnature-arranged and disarranged blooms. A chance sentence in the letter\r\nof a flower-loving friend, one whose refined taste is an inherent\r\nportion of her nature, runs thus:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have the same love, the same sense of perfect satisfaction, in\r\n     the old formal garden that I have in the sonnet in poetry, in the\r\n     Greek drama as contrasted with the modern drama; something within\r\n     me is ever drawn toward that which is restrained and classic.\"\r\n\r\nIn these few words, then, is defined the charm of the formal garden--a\r\nwell-ordered, a classic restraint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden at Drumthwacket, Princeton, New Jersey.]\r\n\r\nSome of the new formal gardens seem imperfect in design and inadequate\r\nin execution; worse still, they are unsuited to their surroundings; but\r\ngracious nature will give even to these many charms of color, fragrance,\r\nand shape through lavish plant growth. I have had given to me sets of\r\nbeautiful photographs of these new Italian gardens, which I long to\r\ninclude with my pictures of older flower beds; but I cannot do so in\r\nfull in a book on Old-time Gardens, though they are copied from far\r\nolder gardens than our American ones. I give throughout my book\r\noccasional glimpses of detail in modern formal gardens; and two examples\r\nmay be fitly illustrated and described in comparative fulness in this\r\nbook, because they are not only unusual in their beauty and promise, but\r\nbecause they have in plan and execution some bearing on my special\r\npresentation of gardens. These two are the gardens of Avonwood Court in\r\nHaverford, Pennsylvania, the country-seat of Charles E. Mather, Esq., of\r\nPhiladelphia; and of Yaddo, in Saratoga, New York, the country-seat of\r\nSpencer Trask, Esq., of New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial at Avonwood Court, Haverford, Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nThe garden at Avonwood Court was designed and laid out in 1896 by Mr.\r\nPercy Ash. The flower planting was done by Mr. John Cope; and the garden\r\nis delightsome in proportions, contour, and aspect. Its claim to\r\nillustrative description in this book lies in the fact that it is\r\nplanted chiefly with old-fashioned flowers, and its beds are laid out\r\nand bordered with thriving Box in a truly old-time mode. It affords a\r\nstriking example of the beauty and satisfaction that can come from the\r\nuse of Box as an edging, and old-time flowers as a filling of these\r\nbeds. Among the two hundred different plants are great rows of yellow\r\nDay Lilies shown in the view facing page 76; regular plantings of\r\nPeonies; borders of Flower de Luce; banks of Lilies of the Valley; rows\r\nof white Fraxinella and Lupine, beds of fringed Poppies, sentinels of\r\nYucca--scores of old favorites have grown and thriven in the cheery\r\nmanner they ever display when they are welcome and beloved. The sun-dial\r\nin this garden is shown facing page 82; it was designed by Mr. Percy\r\nAsh, and can be regarded as a model of simple outlines, good\r\nproportions, careful placing, and symmetrical setting. By placing I mean\r\nthat it is in the right site in relation to the surrounding flower beds,\r\nand to the general outlines of the garden; it is a dignified and\r\nsignificant garden centre. By setting I mean its being raised to proper\r\nprominence in the garden scheme, by being placed at the top of a\r\nplatform formed of three circular steps of ample proportion and suitable\r\nheight, that its pedestal is also of the right size and not so high but\r\none can, when standing on the top step, read with ease the dial's\r\nresponse to our question, \"What's the time o' the day?\" The hedges and\r\nwalls of Honeysuckle, Roses, and other flowering vines that surround\r\nthis garden have thriven wonderfully in the five years of the garden's\r\nlife, and look like settings of many years. The simple but graceful wall\r\nseat gives some idea of the symmetrical and simple garden\r\nfurnishings, as well as the profusion of climbing vines that form the\r\ngarden's boundaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entrance Porch and Gate to the Rose Garden at Yaddo.]\r\n\r\nThis book bears on the title-page a redrawing of a charming old woodcut\r\nof the eighteenth century, a very good example of the art thought and\r\nart execution of that day, being the work of a skilful designer. It is\r\nfrom an old stilted treatise on orchards and gardens, and it depicts a\r\ncheerful little Love, with anxious face and painstaking care, measuring\r\nand laying out the surface of the earth in a garden. On his either side\r\nare old clipped Yews; and at his feet a spade and pots of garden\r\nflowers, among them the Fritillary so beloved of all flower lovers and\r\nherbalists of that day, a significant flower--a flower of meaning and\r\nmystery. This drawing may be taken as an old-time emblem, and a happy\r\none, to symbolize the making of the beautiful modern Rose Garden at\r\nYaddo; where Love, with tenderest thought, has laid out the face of the\r\nearth in an exquisite garden of Roses, for the happiness and recreation\r\nof a dearly loved wife. The noble entrance gate and porch of this Rose\r\nGarden formed a happy surprise to the garden's mistress when unveiled at\r\nthe dedication of the garden. They are depicted on page 81, and there\r\nmay be read the inscription which tells in a few well-chosen words the\r\nstory of the inspiration of the garden; but \"between the lines,\" to\r\nthose who know the Rose Garden and its makers, the inscription speaks\r\nwith even deeper meaning the story of a home whose beauty is only\r\nequalled by the garden's spirit. To all such readers the Rose Garden\r\nbecomes a fitting expression of the life of those who own it and care\r\nfor it. This quality of expression, of significance, may be seen in many\r\na smaller and simpler garden, even in a tiny cottage plot; you can\r\nperceive, through the care bestowed upon it, and its responsive\r\nblossoming, a _something_ which shows the life of the garden owners; you\r\nknow that they are thoughtful, kindly, beauty-loving, home-loving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pergola and Terrace Walk in Rose Garden at Yaddo.]\r\n\r\nBehind the beautiful pergola of the Yaddo garden, set thickly with\r\nCrimson Rambler, a screenlike row of poplars divides the Rose Garden\r\nfrom a luxuriant Rock Garden, and an Old-fashioned Garden of large\r\nextent, extraordinary profusion, and many years' growth. Perhaps the\r\nlatter-named garden might seem more suited to my pages, since it is more\r\nadvanced in growth and apparently more akin to my subject; but I wish to\r\nwrite specially of the Rose Garden, because it is an unusual example of\r\nwhat can be accomplished without aid of architect or landscape gardener,\r\nwhen good taste, careful thought, attention to detail, a love of\r\nflowers, and _intent to attain perfection_ guide the garden's makers. It\r\nis happily placed in a country of most charming topography, but it must\r\nnot be thought that the garden shaped itself; its beautiful proportions,\r\ncontour, and shape were carefully studied out and brought to the present\r\nperfection by the same force that is felt in the garden's smallest\r\ndetail, the power of Love. The Rose Garden is unusually large for a\r\nformal garden; with its vistas and walks, the connected Daffodil Dell,\r\nand the Rock Garden, it fills about ten acres. But the estate is over\r\neight hundred acres, and the house very large in ground extent, so the\r\ngarden seems well-proportioned. This Rose Garden has an unusual\r\nattraction in the personal interest of every detail, such as is found in\r\nfew American gardens of great size, and indeed in few English gardens.\r\nThe gardens of the Countess Warwick, at Easton Lodge, in Essex, possess\r\nthe same charm, a personal meaning and significance in the statues and\r\nfountains, and even in the planting of flower borders. The illustration\r\non page 83 depicts the general shape of the Yaddo Rose Garden, as seen\r\nfrom the upper terrace; but it does not show how the garden stretches\r\ndown the fine marble steps, past the marble figures of Diana and Paris,\r\nand along the paths of standard Roses, past the shallow fountain which\r\nis not so large as to obscure what speaks the garden's story, the statue\r\nof Christalan, that grand creation in one of Mrs. Trask's idyls, _Under\r\nKing Constantine_. This heroic figure, showing to full extent the genius\r\nof the sculptor, William Ordway Partridge, also figures the genius of\r\nthe poet-creator, and is of an inexpressible and impressive nobility.\r\nWith hand and arm held to heaven, Christalan shows against the\r\nbackground of rich evergreens as the true knight of this garden of\r\nsentiment and chivalry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Statue of Christalan in Rose Garden at Yaddo.]\r\n\r\n    \"The sunlight slanting westward through the trees\r\n     Fell first upon his lifted, golden head,\r\n     Making a shining helmet of his curls,\r\n     And then upon the Lilies in his hand.\r\n     His eyes had a defiant, fearless glow;\r\n     Against the sombre background of the wood\r\n     He looked scarce human.\"\r\n\r\nThe larger and more impressive fountain at Yaddo is shown on these\r\npages. It is one hundred feet long and seventy feet wide, and is in\r\nfront of the house, to the east. Its marble figures signify the Dawn;\r\nit will be noted that on this site its beauties show against a suited\r\nand ample background, and its grand proportions are not permitted to\r\nobscure the fine statue of Christalan from the view of those seated on\r\nthe terrace or walking under the shade of the pergola.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial in Rose Garden at Yaddo.]\r\n\r\nEspecially beautiful is the sun-dial on the upper terrace, shown on page\r\n86. The metal dial face is supported by a marble slab resting on two\r\ncarved standards of classic design representing conventionalized lions,\r\nthese being copies of those two splendid standards unearthed at Pompeii,\r\nwhich still may be seen by the side of the impluvium in the atrium or\r\nmain hall of the finest Graeco-Roman dwelling-place which has been\r\nrestored in that wonderful city. These sun-dial standards at Yaddo were\r\nmade by the permission and under the supervision of the Italian\r\ngovernment. I can conceive nothing more fitting or more inspiring to the\r\nimagination than that, telling as they do the story of the splendor of\r\nancient Pompeii and of the passing centuries, they should now uphold to\r\nour sight a sun-dial as if to bid us note the flight of time and the\r\nvastness of the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bronze Face of Dial in Rose Garden at Yaddo.]\r\n\r\nThe entire sun-dial, with its beautiful adjuncts of carefully shaped\r\nmarble seats, stands on a semicircular plaza of marble at the head of\r\nthe noble flight of marble steps. The engraved metal dial face bears\r\ntwo exquisite verses--the gift of one poet to another--of Dr. Henry Van\r\nDyke to the garden's mistress, Katrina Trask. These dial mottoes are\r\nunusual, and perfect examples of that genius which with a few words can\r\nshape a lasting gem of our English tongue. At the edge of the dial face\r\nis this motto:\r\n\r\n    \"Hours fly,\r\n     Flowers die,\r\n     New Days,\r\n     New Ways,\r\n     Pass by;\r\n     Love stays.\"\r\n\r\nAt the base of the gnomon is the second motto:--\r\n\r\n            Time is\r\n    Too Slow for those who Wait,\r\n    Too Swift for those who Fear,\r\n    Too Long for those who Grieve,\r\n    Too Short for those who Rejoice;\r\n    But for those who Love,\r\n            Time is\r\n            Eternity.\r\n\r\nI have for years been a student of sun-dial lore, a collector of\r\nsun-dial mottoes and inscriptions, of which I have many hundreds. I know\r\nnowhere, either in English, on English or Scotch sun-dials, or in the\r\nContinental tongues, any such exquisite dial legends as these two--so\r\nslight of form, so simple in wording, so pure in diction, yet of\r\nsentiment, of thought, how full! how impressive! They stamp themselves\r\nforever on the memory as beautiful examples of what James Russell Lowell\r\ncalled verbal magic; that wonderful quality which comes, neither from\r\nchosen words, nor from their careful combination into sentences, but\r\nfrom something which is as inexplicable in its nature as it is in its\r\ncharm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Pine in Garden at Yaddo.]\r\n\r\nTo tree lovers the gardens and grounds at Yaddo have glorious charms in\r\ntheir splendid trees; but one can be depicted here--the grand native\r\nPine, over eight feet in diameter, which, with other stately sentinels\r\nof its race, stands a sombrely beautiful guard over all this\r\nloveliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBOX EDGINGS\r\n\r\n     \"They walked over the crackling leaves in the garden, between the\r\n     lines of Box, breathing its fragrance of eternity; for this is one\r\n     of the odors which carry us out of time into the abysses of the\r\n     unbeginning past; if we ever lived on another ball of stone than\r\n     this, it must be that there was Box growing on it.\"\r\n\r\n     --_Elsie Venner_, OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo many of us, besides Dr. Holmes, the unique aroma of the Box, cleanly\r\nbitter in scent as in taste, is redolent of the eternal past; it is\r\nalmost hypnotic in its effect. This strange power is not felt by all,\r\nnor is it a present sensitory influence; it is an hereditary memory,\r\nhalf-known by many, but fixed in its intensity in those of New England\r\nbirth and descent, true children of the Puritans; to such ones the Box\r\nbreathes out the very atmosphere of New England's past. I cannot see in\r\nclear outline those prim gardens of centuries ago, nor the faces of\r\nthose who walked and worked therein; but I know, as I stroll to-day\r\nbetween our old Box-edged borders, and inhale the beloved bitterness of\r\nfragrance, and gather a stiff sprig of the beautiful glossy leaves, that\r\nin truth the garden lovers and garden workers of other days walk beside\r\nme, though unseen and unheard.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago a bright young Yankee girl went to the island of\r\nCuba as a governess to the family of a sugar planter. It was regarded as\r\na somewhat perilous adventure by her home-staying folk, and their\r\napprehensions of ill were realized in her death there five years later.\r\nThis was not, however, all that happened to her. The planter's wife had\r\ndied in this interval of time, and she had been married to the widower.\r\nA daughter had been born, who, after her mother's death, was reared in\r\nthe Southern island, in Cuban ways, having scant and formal\r\ncommunication with her New England kin. When this girl was twenty years\r\nold, she came to the little Massachusetts town where her mother had been\r\nreared, and met there a group of widowed and maiden aunts, and\r\ngreat-aunts. After sitting for a time in her mother's room in the old\r\nhome, the reserve which often exists between those of the same race who\r\nshould be friends but whose lives have been widely apart, and who can\r\nnever have more than a passing sight of each other, made them in\r\nsemi-embarrassment and lack of resources of mutual interest walk out\r\ninto the garden. As they passed down the path between high lines of Box,\r\nthe girl suddenly stopped, looked in terror at the gate, and screamed\r\nout in fright, \"The dog, the dog, save me, he will kill me!\" _No dog was\r\nthere_, but on that very spot, between those Box hedges, thirty years\r\nbefore, her mother had been attacked and bitten by an enraged dog, to\r\nthe distress and apprehension of the aunts, who all recalled the\r\noccurrence, as they reassured the fainting and bewildered girl. She, of\r\ncourse, had never known aught of this till she was told it by the old\r\nBox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: House and Garden at Napanock. County Ulster, New York.]\r\n\r\nMany other instances of the hypnotic effect of Box are known, and also\r\nof its strong influence on the mind through memory. I know of a man who\r\ntravelled a thousand miles to renew acquaintance and propose marriage to\r\nan old sweetheart, whom he had not seen and scarcely thought of for\r\nyears, having been induced to this act wholly through memories of her,\r\nawakened by a chance stroll in an old Box-edged garden such as those of\r\nhis youth; at the gate of one of which he had often lingered, after\r\nwalking home with her from singing-school. I ought to be able to add\r\nthat the twain were married as a result of this sentimental\r\nmemory-awakening through the old Box; but, in truth, they never came\r\nvery close to matrimony. For when he saw her he remained absolutely\r\nsilent on the subject of marriage; the fickle creature forgot the Box\r\nscent and the singing-school, while she openly expressed to her friends\r\nher surprise at his aged appearance, and her pity for his dulness. For\r\nthe sense of sight is more powerful than that of smell, and the Box\r\nmight prove a master hand at hinting, but it failed utterly in permanent\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThose who have not loved the Box for centuries in the persons and with\r\nthe partial noses of their Puritan forbears, complain of its curious\r\nscent, say, like Polly Peacham, that \"they can't abear it,\" and declare\r\nthat it brings ever the thought of old graveyards. I have never seen\r\nBox in ancient burying-grounds, they were usually too neglected to be\r\nthus planted; but it was given a limited space in the cemeteries of the\r\nmiddle of this century. Even those borders have now generally been dug\r\nup to give place to granite copings.\r\n\r\nThe scent of Box has been aptly worded by Gabriel d'Annunzio, in his\r\n_Virgin of the Rocks_, in his description of a neglected garden. He\r\ncalls it a \"bitter sweet odor,\" and he notes its influence in making his\r\nwanderers in this garden \"reconstruct some memory of their far-off\r\nchildhood.\"\r\n\r\nThe old Jesuit poet Rapin writing in the seventeenth century tells a\r\nfanciful tale that--\r\n\r\n    \"Gardens of old, nor Art, nor Rules obey'd,\r\n     But unadorn'd, or wild Neglect betray'd;\"\r\n\r\nthat Flora's hair hung undressed, neglected \"in artless tresses,\" until\r\nin pity another nymph \"around her head wreath'd a Boxen Bough\" from the\r\nfields; which so improved her beauty that trim edgings were placed ever\r\nafter--\"where flowers disordered once at random grew.\"\r\n\r\nHe then describes the various figures of Box, the way to plant it, its\r\ndisadvantages, and the associate flowers that should be set with it, all\r\nin stilted verse.\r\n\r\nQueen Anne was a royal enemy of Box. By her order many of the famous Box\r\nhedges at Hampton Court were destroyed; by her example, many old\r\nBox-edged gardens throughout England were rooted up. There are manifold\r\nobjections raised to Box besides the dislike of its distinctive odor:\r\nheavy edgings and hedges of Box \"take away the heart of the ground\" and\r\nflowers pine within Box-edged borders; the roots of Box on the inside of\r\nthe flower knot or bed, therefore, have to be cut and pulled out in\r\norder to leave the earth free for flower roots. It is also alleged that\r\nBox harbors slugs--and I fear it does.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box Parterre at Hampton.]\r\n\r\nWe are told that it is not well to plant Box edgings in our gardens,\r\nbecause Box is so frail, is so easily winter-killed, that it dies down\r\nin ugly fashion. Yet see what great trees it forms, even when untrimmed,\r\nas in the Prince Garden (page 31). It is true that Box does not always\r\nflourish in the precise shape you wish, but it has nevertheless a\r\nwonderfully tenacious hold on life. I know nothing more suggestive of\r\npersistence and of sad sentiment than the view often seen in forlorn\r\ncity enclosures, as you drive past, or rush by in an electric car, of an\r\naged bush of Box, or a few feet of old Box hedge growing in the beaten\r\nearth of a squalid back yard, surrounded by dirty tenement houses. Once\r\na fair garden there grew; the turf and flowers and trees are vanished;\r\nbut spared through accident, or because deemed so valueless, the Box\r\nstill lives. Even in Washington and other Southern cities, where the\r\nnegro population eagerly gather Box at Christmas-tide, you will see\r\nthese forlorn relics of the garden still growing, and their bitter\r\nfragrance rises above the vile odors of the crowded slums.\r\n\r\nBox formed an important feature of the garden of Pliny's favorite villa\r\nin Tuscany, which he described in his letter to Apollinaris. How I\r\nshould have loved its formal beauty! On the southern front a terrace was\r\nbordered with a Box hedge and \"embellished with various figures in Box,\r\nthe representation of divers animals.\" Beyond was a circus formed around\r\nby ranges of Box rising in walls of varied heights. The middle of this\r\ncircus was ornamented with figures of Box. On one side was a hippodrome\r\nset with a plantation of Box trees backed with Plane trees; thence ran a\r\nstraight walk divided by Box hedges into alleys. Thus expanses were\r\nenclosed, one of which held a beautiful meadow, another had \"knots of\r\nPlane tree,\" another was \"set with Box a thousand different forms.\" Some\r\nof these were letters expressing the name of the owner of all this\r\nextravagance; or the initials of various fair Roman dames, a very\r\ngallant pleasantry of young Pliny. Both Plane tree and Box tree of such\r\nancient gardens were by tradition nourished with wine instead of water.\r\nInitials of Box may be seen to-day in English gardens, and heraldic\r\ndevices. French gardens vied with English gardens in curious patterns in\r\nBox. The garden of Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV. had a stag\r\nchase, in clipped Box, with greyhounds in chase. Globes, pyramids,\r\ntubes, cylinders, cones, arches, and other shapes were cut in Box as\r\nthey were in Yew.\r\n\r\nA very pretty conceit in Box was--\r\n\r\n    \"Horizontal dials on the ground\r\n     In living Box by cunning artists traced.\"\r\n\r\nReference is frequent enough to these dials of Box to show that they\r\nwere not uncommon in fine old English gardens. There were sun-dials\r\neither of Box or Thrift, in the gardens of colleges both at Oxford and\r\nCambridge, as may be seen in Loggan's _Views_. Two modern ones are\r\nshown; one, on page 98, is in the garden of Lady Lennox, at Broughton\r\nCastle, Banbury, England. Another of exceptionally fine growth and trim\r\nperfection in the garden at Ascott, the seat of Mr. Leopold de\r\nRothschild (opposite page 100.) These are curious rather than beautiful,\r\nbut display well that quality given in the poet's term \"the tonsile\r\nBox.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial in Box at Broughton Castle.]\r\n\r\nWriting of a similar sun-dial, Lady Warwick says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Never was such a perfect timekeeper as my sun-dial, and the\r\n     figures which record the hours are all cut out and trimmed in Box,\r\n     and there again on its outer ring is a legend which read in\r\n     whatever way you please: Les heures heureuses ne se comptent pas.\r\n     They were outlined for me, those words, in baby sprigs of Box by a\r\n     friend who is no more, who loved my garden and was good to it.\"\r\n\r\nBox hedges were much esteemed in England--so says Parkinson, to dry\r\nlinen on, affording the raised expanse and even surface so much desired.\r\nIt can always be noted in all domestic records of early days that the\r\nvast washing of linen and clothing was one of the great events of the\r\nyear. Sometimes, in households of plentiful supply, these washings were\r\ndone but once a year; in other homes, semi-annually. The drying and\r\nbleaching linen was an unceasing attraction to rascals like Autolycus,\r\nwho had a \"pugging tooth\"--that is, a prigging tooth. These linen\r\nthieves had a special name, they were called \"prygmen\"; they wandered\r\nthrough the country on various pretexts, men and their doxies, and were\r\nthe bane of English housewives.\r\n\r\nThe Box hedges were also in constant use to hold the bleaching webs of\r\nhomespun and woven flaxen and hempen stuff, which were often exposed for\r\nweeks in the dew and sunlight. In 1710 a reason given for the disuse and\r\ndestruction of \"quicksetted arbors and hedges\" was that they \"agreed\r\nvery ill with the ladies' muslins.\"\r\n\r\nBox was of little value in the apothecary shop, was seldom used in\r\nmedicine. Parkinson said that the leaves and dust of boxwood \"boyld in\r\nlye\" would make hair to be \"of an Aborne or Abraham color\"--that is,\r\nauburn. This was a very primitive hair dye, but it must have been a\r\npowerful one.\r\n\r\nBoxwood was a firm, beautiful wood, used to make tablets for\r\ninscriptions of note. The mottled wood near the root was called dudgeon.\r\nHolland's translation of Pliny says, \"The Box tree seldome hath any\r\ngrain crisped damaske-wise, and never but about the root, the which is\r\ndudgin.\" From its esteemed use for dagger hilts came the word\r\ndudgeon-dagger, and the terms \"drawn-dudgeon\" and \"high-dudgeon,\"\r\nmeaning offence or discord.\r\n\r\nI plead for the Box, not for its fragrance, for you may not be so\r\nfortunate as to have a Puritan sense of smell, nor for its weird\r\ninfluence, for that is intangible; but because it is the most becoming\r\nof all edgings to our garden borders of old-time flowers. The clear\r\ncompact green of its shining leaves, the trim distinctness of its\r\nclipped lines, the attributes that made Pope term it the \"shapely Box,\"\r\nmake it the best of all foils for the varied tints of foliage, the many\r\ncolors of bloom, and the careless grace in growth of the flowers within\r\nthe border.\r\n\r\nBox edgings are pleasant, too, in winter, showing in grateful relief\r\nagainst the tiresome monotony of the snow expanse. And they bear\r\nsometimes a crown of lightest snow wreaths, which seem like a white\r\nblossoming in promise of the beauties of the border in the coming\r\nsummer. Pick a bit of this winter Box, even with the mercury below zero.\r\nLo! you have a breath of the hot dryness of the midsummer garden.\r\n\r\nBox grows to great size, even twenty feet in height. In Southern\r\ngardens, where it is seldom winter-killed, it is often of noble\r\nproportions. In the lovely garden of Martha Washington at Mount Vernon\r\nthe Box is still preserved in the beauty and interest of its original\r\nform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial in Box at Ascott.]\r\n\r\nThe Box edgings and hedges of many other Southern gardens still are\r\nin good condition; those of the old Preston homestead at Columbia, South\r\nCarolina (shown on pages 15 and 18, and facing page 54), owe their\r\npreservation during the Civil War to the fact that the house was then\r\nthe refuge of a sisterhood of nuns. The Ridgely estate, Hampton, in\r\nCounty Baltimore, Maryland, has a formal garden in which the perfection\r\nof the Box is a delight. The will of Captain Charles Ridgely, in 1787,\r\nmade an appropriation of money and land for this garden. The high\r\nterrace which overlooks the garden and the shallow ones which break the\r\nsouthern slope and mark the boundaries of each parterre are fine\r\nexamples of landscape art, and are said to be the work of Major Chase\r\nBarney, a famous military engineer. By 1829 the garden was an object of\r\nbeauty and much renown. A part only of the original parterre remains,\r\nbut the more modern flower borders, through the unusual perspective and\r\ncontour of the garden, do not clash with the old Box-edged beds. These\r\nedgings were reset in 1870, and are always kept very closely cut. The\r\ncircular domes of clipped box arise from stems at least a hundred years\r\nold. The design of the parterre is so satisfactory that I give three\r\nviews of it in order to show it fully. (See pages 57, 60, and 95.)\r\n\r\nA Box-edged garden of much beauty and large extent existed for some\r\nyears in the grounds connected with the County Jail in Fitchburg,\r\nMassachusetts. It was laid out by the wife of the warden, aided by the\r\nmanual labor of convicted prisoners, with her earnest hope that working\r\namong flowers would have a benefiting and softening influence on these\r\ncriminals. She writes rather dubiously: \"They all enjoyed being out of\r\ndoors with their pipes, whether among the flowers or the vegetables; and\r\nno attempt at escape was ever made by any of them while in the\r\ncomparative freedom of the flower-garden.\" She planted and marked\r\ndistinctly in this garden over seven hundred groups of annuals and hardy\r\nperennials, hoping the men would care to learn the names of the flowers,\r\nand through that knowledge, and their practise in the care of Box\r\nedgings and hedges, be able to obtain positions as under-gardeners when\r\ntheir terms of imprisonment expired.\r\n\r\nThe garden at Tudor Place, the home of Mrs. Beverley Kennon (page 103),\r\ndisplays fine Box; and the garden of the poet Longfellow which is said\r\nto have been laid out after the Box-edged parterres at Versailles.\r\nThroughout this book are scattered several good examples of Box from\r\nSalem and other towns; in a sweet, old garden on Kingston Hill, Rhode\r\nIsland (page 104) the flower-beds are anchor-shaped.\r\n\r\nIn favorable climates Box edgings may grow in such vigor as to entirely\r\nfill the garden beds. An example of this is given on page 105, showing\r\nthe garden at Tuckahoe. The beds were laid out over a large space of\r\nground in a beautiful design, which still may be faintly seen by\r\nexamining the dark expanse beside the house, which is now almost solid\r\nBox. The great hedges by the avenue are also Box; between similar ones\r\nat Upton Court in Camden, South Carolina, riders on horseback cannot be\r\nseen nor see over it. New England towns seldom show such growth of Box;\r\nbut in Hingham, Massachusetts, at the home of Mrs. Robbins, author of\r\nthat charming book, _The Rescue of an Old Place_, there is a Box bower,\r\nwith walls of Box fifteen feet in height. These walls were originally\r\nthe edgings of a flower bed on the \"Old Place.\" Read Dr. John Brown's\r\ncharming account of the Box bower of the \"Queen's Maries.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden at Tudor Place.]\r\n\r\nBox grows on Long Island with great vigor. At Brecknock Hall, the family\r\nresidence of Mrs. Albert Delafield at Greenport, Long Island, the\r\nhedges of plain and variegated Box are unusually fine, and the paths are\r\nwell laid out. Some of them are entirely covered by the closing together\r\nof the two hedges which are often six or seven feet in height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anchor-shaped Flower-beds. Kingston, Rhode Island.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the constant assertion of the winter-killing of Box in the\r\nNorth, the oldest Box in the country is that at Sylvester Manor, Shelter\r\nIsland, New York. The estate is now owned by the tenth mistress of the\r\nmanor, Miss Cornelia Horsford; the first mistress of the manor, Grissel\r\nSylvester, who had been Grissel Gardiner, came there in 1652. It is\r\ntold, and is doubtless true, that she brought there the first Box\r\nplants, to make, in what was then a far-away island, a semblance of her\r\nhome garden. It is said that this Box was thriving in Madam Sylvester's\r\ngarden when George Fox preached there to the Indians. The oldest Box is\r\nfifteen or eighteen feet high; not so tall, I think, as the neglected\r\nBox at Vaucluse, the old Hazard place near Newport, but far more massive\r\nand thrifty and shapely. Box needs unusual care and judgment, an\r\ninstinct almost, for the removal of certain portions. It sends out tiny\r\nrootlets at the joints of the sprays, and these grow readily. The\r\nlargest and oldest Box bushes at Sylvester Manor garden are a study in\r\ntheir strong, hearty stems, their perfect foliage, their symmetry; they\r\nshow their care of centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Box at Tuckahoe.]\r\n\r\nThe delightful Box-edged flower beds were laid out in their present form\r\nabout seventy years ago by the grandfather of the present owner. There\r\nis a Lower Garden, a Terrace Garden, which are shown on succeeding\r\npages, a Fountain Garden, a Rose Garden, a Water Garden; a bit of the\r\nlatter is on page 75. In some portions of these gardens, especially on\r\nthe upper terrace, the Box is so high, and set in such quaint and\r\nrambling figures, that it closely approaches an old English maze; and it\r\nwas a pretty sight to behold a group of happy little children running in\r\nand out among these Box hedges that extended high over their heads,\r\nsearching long and eagerly for the central bower where their little tea\r\nparty was set.\r\n\r\nOver these old garden borders hangs literally an atmosphere of the past;\r\nthe bitter perfume stimulates the imagination as we walk by the side of\r\nthese splendid Box bushes, and think, as every one must, of what they\r\nhave seen, of what they know; on this garden is written the history of\r\nover two centuries of beautiful domestic home life. It is well that we\r\nstill have such memorials to teach us the nobility and beauty of such a\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE HERB GARDEN\r\n\r\n     \"To have nothing here but Sweet Herbs, and those only choice ones\r\n     too, and every kind its bed by itself.\"\r\n\r\n     --DESIDERIUS ERASMUS, 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Montaigne's time it was the custom to dedicate special chapters of\r\nbooks to special persons. Were it so to-day, I should dedicate this\r\nchapter to the memory of a friend who has been constantly in my mind\r\nwhile writing it; for she formed in her beautiful garden, near our\r\nmodern city, Chicago, the only perfect herb garden I know,--a garden\r\nthat is the counterpart of the garden of Erasmus, made four centuries\r\nago; for in it are \"nothing but Sweet Herbs, and choice ones too, and\r\nevery kind its bed by itself.\" A corner of it is shown on page 108. This\r\nherb garden is so well laid out that I will give directions therefrom\r\nfor a bed of similar planting. It may be placed at the base of a grass\r\nbank or at the edge of a garden. Let two garden walks be laid out, one\r\nat the lower edge, perhaps, of the bank, the other parallel, ten,\r\nfifteen, twenty feet away. Let narrow paths be left at regular intervals\r\nrunning parallel from walk to walk, as do the rounds of a ladder from\r\nthe two side bars. In the narrow oblong beds formed by these paths plant\r\nsolid rows of herbs, each variety by itself, with no attempt at\r\ndiversity of design. You can thus walk among them, and into them, and\r\nsmell them in their concentrated strength, and you can gather them at\r\nease. On the bank can be placed the creeping Thyme, and other\r\nlow-running herbs. Medicinal shrubs should be the companions of the\r\nherbs; plant these as you will, according to their growth and habit,\r\nmaking them give variety of outline to the herb garden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Herb Garden at White Birches, Elmhurst, Illinois.]\r\n\r\nThere are few persons who have a strong enough love of leaf scents, or\r\ninterest in herbs, to make them willing to spend much time in working in\r\nan herb garden. The beauty and color of flowers would compensate them,\r\nbut not the growth or scent of leafage. It is impossible to describe to\r\none who does not feel by instinct \"the lure of green things growing,\"\r\nthe curious stimulation, the sense of intoxication, of delight, brought\r\nby working among such green-growing, sweet-scented things. The maker of\r\nthis interesting garden felt this stimulation and delight; and at her\r\ncity home on a bleak day in December we both revelled in holding and\r\nbreathing in the scent of tiny sprays of Rue, Rosemary, and Balm which,\r\nstill green, had been gathered from beneath fallen leaves and stalks in\r\nher country garden, as a tender and grateful attention of one herb lover\r\nto another. Thus did she prove Shakespeare's words true even on the\r\nshores of Lake Michigan:--\r\n\r\n    \"Rosemary and Rue: these keep\r\n     Seeming and savor all the winter long.\"\r\n\r\nThere is ample sentiment in the homely inhabitants of the herb garden.\r\nThe herb garden of the Countess of Warwick is called by her a Garden of\r\nSentiment. Each plant is labelled with a pottery marker, swallow-shaped,\r\nbearing in ineradicable colors the flower name and its significance.\r\nThus there is Balm for sympathy, Bay for glory, Foxglove for sincerity,\r\nBasil for hatred.\r\n\r\nA recent number of _The Garden_ deplored the dying out of herbs in old\r\nEnglish gardens; so I think it may prove of interest to give the list of\r\nherbs and medicinal shrubs and trees which grew in this friend's herb\r\ngarden in the new world across the sea.\r\n\r\n     Arnica, Anise, Ambrosia, Agrimony, Aconite.\r\n\r\n     Belladonna, Black Alder, Betony, Boneset or Thorough-wort, Sweet\r\n     Basil, Bryony, Borage, Burnet, Butternut, Balm, _Melissa\r\n     officinalis_, Balm (variegated), Bee-balm, or Oswego tea, mild,\r\n     false, and true Bergamot, Burdock, Bloodroot, Black Cohosh,\r\n     Barberry, Bittersweet, Butterfly-weed, Birch, Blackberry,\r\n     Button-Snakeroot, Buttercup.\r\n\r\n     Costmary, or Sweet Mary, Calamint, Choke-cherry, Comfrey,\r\n     Coriander, Cumin, Catnip, Caraway, Chives, Castor-oil Bean,\r\n     Colchicum, Cedronella, Camomile, Chicory, Cardinal-flower,\r\n     Celandine, Cotton, Cranesbill, Cow-parsnip, High-bush Cranberry.\r\n\r\n     Dogwood, Dutchman's-pipe, Dill, Dandelion, Dock, Dogbane.\r\n\r\n     Elder, Elecampane, Slippery Elm.\r\n\r\n     Sweet Fern, Fraxinella, Fennel, Flax, Fumitory, Fig, Sweet Flag,\r\n     Blue Flag, Foxglove.\r\n\r\n     Goldthread, Gentian, Goldenrod.\r\n\r\n     Hellebore, Henbane, Hops, Horehound, Hyssop, Horseradish,\r\n     Horse-chestnut, Hemlock, Small Hemlock or Fool's Parsley.\r\n\r\n     American Ipecac, Indian Hemp, Poison Ivy, wild, false, and blue\r\n     Indigo, wild yellow Indigo, wild white Indigo.\r\n\r\n     Juniper, Joepye-weed.\r\n\r\n     Lobelia, Lovage, Lavender Lemon Verbena, Lemon, Mountain Laurel,\r\n     Yellow Lady's-slippers, Lily of the Valley, Liverwort, Wild\r\n     Lettuce, Field Larkspur, Lungwort.\r\n\r\n     Mosquito plant, Wild Mint, Motherwort, Mullein, Sweet Marjoram,\r\n     Meadowsweet, Marshmallow, Mandrake, Mulberry, black and white\r\n     Mustard, Mayweed, Mugwort, Marigold.\r\n\r\n     Nigella.\r\n\r\n     Opium Poppy, Orange, Oak.\r\n\r\n     Pulsatilla, Pellitory or Pyrethrum, Red Pepper, Peppermint,\r\n     Pennyroyal, False Pennyroyal, Pope-weed, Pine, Pigweed, Pumpkin,\r\n     Parsley, Prince's-pine, Peony, Plantain.\r\n\r\n     Rhubarb, Rue, Rosemary, Rosa gallica, Dog Rose.\r\n\r\n     Sassafras, Saxifrage, Sweet Cicely, Sage (common blue), Sage (red),\r\n     Summer Savory, Winter Savory, Santonin, Sweet Woodruff, Saffron,\r\n     Spearmint, wild Sarsaparilla, Black Snakeroot, Squills, Senna,\r\n     St.-John's-Wort, Sorrel, Spruce Fir, Self-heal, Southernwood.\r\n\r\n     Thorn Apple, Tansy, Thyme, Tobacco, Tarragon.\r\n\r\n     Valerian, Dogtooth Violet, Blue Violet.\r\n\r\n     Witchhazel, Wormwood, Wintergreen, Willow, Walnut.\r\n\r\n     Yarrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden at White Birches. Elmhurst, Illinois.]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that some common herbs and medicinal plants are\r\nmissing; there is, for instance, no Box; it will not live in that\r\nclimate; and there are many other herbs which this garden held for a\r\nshort time, but which succumbed under the fierce winter winds from Lake\r\nMichigan.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare this list with one made in rhyme three\r\ncenturies ago, the garland of herbs of the nymph Lelipa in Drayton's\r\n_Muse's Elyzium_.\r\n\r\n    \"A chaplet then of Herbs I'll make\r\n       Than which though yours be braver,\r\n     Yet this of mine I'll undertake\r\n       Shall not be short in savour.\r\n     With Basil then I will begin,\r\n       Whose scent is wondrous pleasing:\r\n     This Eglantine I'll next put in\r\n       The sense with sweetness seizing.\r\n     Then in my Lavender I lay\r\n       Muscado put among it,\r\n     With here and there a leaf of Bay,\r\n       Which still shall run along it.\r\n     Germander, Marjoram and Thyme,\r\n       Which used are for strewing;\r\n     With Hyssop as an herb most prime\r\n       Here in my wreath bestowing.\r\n     Then Balm and Mint help to make up\r\n       My chaplet, and for trial\r\n     Costmary that so likes the Cup,\r\n       And next it Pennyroyal.\r\n     Then Burnet shall bear up with this,\r\n       Whose leaf I greatly fancy;\r\n     Some Camomile doth not amiss\r\n       With Savory and some Tansy.\r\n     Then here and there I'll put a sprig\r\n       Of Rosemary into it,\r\n     Thus not too Little nor too Big,\r\n       'Tis done if I can do it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden of Manning Homestead, Salem, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nAnother name for the herb garden was the olitory; and the word herber,\r\nor herbar, would at first sight appear to be an herbarium, an herb\r\ngarden; it was really an arbor. I have such satisfaction in herb\r\ngardens, and in the herbs themselves, and in all their uses, all their\r\nlore, that I am confirmed in my belief that I really care far less for\r\nBotany than for that old-time regard and study of plants covered by the\r\nsignificant name, Wort-cunning. Wort was a good old common English word,\r\nlost now in our use, save as the terminal syllable of certain\r\nplant-names; it is a pity we have given it up since its equivalent,\r\nherb, seems so variable in application, especially in that very trying\r\nexpression of which we weary so of late--herbaceous border. This seems\r\nan architect's phrase rather than a florist's; you always find it on the\r\nplans of fine houses with gardens. To me it annihilates every\r\npossibility of sentiment, and it usually isn't correct, since many of\r\nthe plants in these borders are woody perennials instead of annuals;\r\nany garden planting that is not \"bedding-out\" is wildly named \"an\r\nherbaceous border.\"\r\n\r\nHerb gardens were no vanity and no luxury in our grandmothers' day; they\r\nwere a necessity. To them every good housewife turned for nearly all\r\nthat gave variety to her cooking, and to fill her domestic\r\npharmacopoeia. The physician placed his chief reliance for supplies on\r\nherb gardens and the simples of the fields. An old author says, \"Many an\r\nold wife or country woman doth often more good with a few known and\r\ncommon garden herbs, than our bombast physicians, with all their\r\nprodigious, sumptuous, far-fetched, rare, conjectural medicines.\" Doctor\r\nand goodwife both had a rival in the parson. The picture of the country\r\nparson and his wife given by old George Herbert was equally true of the\r\nNew England minister and his wife:--\r\n\r\n     \"In the knowledge of simples one thing would be carefully observed,\r\n     which is to know what herbs may be used instead of drugs of the\r\n     same nature, and to make the garden the shop; for home-bred\r\n     medicines are both more easy for the parson's purse, and more\r\n     familiar for all men's bodies. So when the apothecary useth either\r\n     for loosing Rhubarb, or for binding Bolearmana, the parson useth\r\n     damask or white Rose for the one, and Plantain, Shepherd's Purse,\r\n     and Knot-grass for the other; and that with better success. As for\r\n     spices, he doth not only prefer home-bred things before them, but\r\n     condemns them for vanities, and so shuts them out of his family,\r\n     esteeming that there is no spice comparable for herbs to Rosemary,\r\n     Thyme, savory Mints, and for seeds to Fennel and Caraway.\r\n     Accordingly, for salves, his wife seeks not the city, but prefers\r\n     her gardens and fields before all outlandish gums.\"\r\n\r\nSimples were medicinal plants, so called because each of these vegetable\r\ngrowths was held to possess an individual virtue, to be an element, a\r\nsimple substance constituting a single remedy. The noun was generally\r\nused in the plural.\r\n\r\nYou must not think that sowing, gathering, drying, and saving these\r\nherbs and simples in any convenient or unstudied way was all that was\r\nnecessary. Not at all; many and manifold were the rules just when to\r\nplant them, when to pick them, how to pick them, how to dry them, and\r\neven how to keep them. Gervayse Markham was very wise in herb lore, in\r\nthe suited seasons of the moon, and hour of the day or night, for herb\r\nculling. In the garret of every old house, such as that of the Ward\r\nHomestead, shown on page 116, with the wreckage of house furniture, were\r\nhung bunches of herbs and simples, waiting for winter use.\r\n\r\nThe still-room was wholly devoted to storing these herbs and\r\nmanufacturing their products. This was the careful work of the house\r\nmistress and her daughters. It was not intrusted to servants. One book\r\nof instruction was entitled, _The Vertuouse Boke of Distyllacyon of the\r\nWaters of all Manner of Herbs_.\r\n\r\nThomas Tusser wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"Good huswives provide, ere an sickness do come,\r\n     Of sundrie good things in house to have some,\r\n     Good aqua composita, vinegar tart,\r\n     Rose water and treacle to comfort the heart,\r\n     Good herbes in the garden for agues that burn,\r\n     That over strong heat to good temper turn.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Under the Garret Eaves of the Ward Homestead. Shrewsbury,\r\nMassachusetts.]\r\n\r\nBoth still-room and simple-closet of a dame of the time of Queen\r\nElizabeth or Queen Anne had crowded shelves. Many an herb and root,\r\nunused to-day, was deemed then of sovereign worth. From a manuscript\r\nreceipt book I have taken names of ingredients, many of which are\r\nseldom, perhaps never, used now in medicine. Unripe Blackberries, Ivy\r\nberries, Eglantine berries, \"Ashen Keys,\" Acorns, stones of Sloes,\r\nParsley seed, Houseleeks, unripe Hazelnuts, Daisy roots, Strawberry\r\n\"strings,\" Woodbine tops, the inner bark of Oak and of red Filberts,\r\ngreen \"Broom Cod,\" White Thorn berries, Turnips, Barberry bark, Dates,\r\nGoldenrod, Gourd seed, Blue Lily roots, Parsnip seed, Asparagus roots,\r\nPeony roots.\r\n\r\nFrom herbs and simples were made, for internal use, liquid medicines\r\nsuch as wines and waters, syrups, juleps; and solids, such as conserves,\r\nconfections, treacles, eclegms, tinctures. There were for external use,\r\namulets, oils, ointments, liniments, plasters, cataplasms, salves,\r\npoultices; also sacculi, little bags of flowers, seeds, herbs, etc., and\r\npomanders and posies.\r\n\r\nThat a certain stimulus could be given to the brain by inhaling the\r\nscent of these herbs will not be doubted, I think, by the herb lover\r\neven of this century. In the _Haven of Health_, 1636, cures were\r\npromised by sleeping on herbs, smelling of them, binding the leaves on\r\nthe forehead, and inhaling the vapors of their boiling or roasting. Mint\r\nwas \"a good Posie for Students to oft smell.\" Pennyroyal \"quickened the\r\nbrain by smelling oft.\" Basil cleared the wits, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe use of herbs in medicine is far from being obsolete; and when we\r\ngive them more stately names we swallow the same dose. Dandelion bitters\r\nis still used for diseases caused by an ill-working liver. Wintergreen,\r\nwhich was universally made into tea or oil for rheumatism, appears now\r\nin prescriptions for the same disease under the name of Gaultheria.\r\nPeppermint, once a sovereign cure for heartburn and \"nuralogy,\" serves\r\nus decked with the title of Menthol. \"Saffern-tea\" never has lost its\r\ngood standing as a cure for the \"jarnders.\" In country communities\r\nscores of old herbs and simples are used in vast amounts; and in every\r\nvillage is some aged man or woman wise in gathering, distilling, and\r\ncompounding these \"potent and parable medicines,\" to use Cotton Mather's\r\nwords. One of these gatherers of simples is shown opposite page 120, a\r\nquaint old figure, seen afar as we drive through country by-roads, as\r\nshe bends over some dense clump of weeds in distant meadow or pasture.\r\n\r\nIn our large city markets bunches of sweet herbs are still sold; and\r\nwithin a year I have seen men passing my city home selling great bunches\r\nof Catnip and Mint, in the spring, and dried Sage, Marjoram, and other\r\nherbs in the autumn. In one case I noted that it was the same man,\r\nunmistakably a real countryman, whom I had noted selling quail on the\r\nstreet, when he had about forty as fine quail as I ever saw. I never saw\r\nhim sell quail, nor herbs. I think his customers are probably all\r\nforeigners--emigrants from continental Europe, chiefly Poles and\r\nItalians.\r\n\r\nThe use of herbs as component parts of love philters and charms is a\r\nmost ancient custom, and lingered into the nineteenth century in country\r\ncommunities. I knew but one case of the manufacture and administering\r\nof a love philter, and it was by a person to whom such an action would\r\nseem utterly incongruous. A very gentle, retiring girl in a New England\r\ntown eighty years ago was deeply in love with the minister whose church\r\nshe attended, and of which her father was the deacon. The parson was a\r\nwidower, nearly of middle age, and exceedingly sombre and reserved in\r\ncharacter--saddened, doubtless, by the loss of his two young children\r\nand his wife through that scourge of New England, consumption; but he\r\nwas very handsome, and even his sadness had its charm. His house, had\r\nburned down as an additional misfortune, and he lived in lodgings with\r\ntwo elderly women of his congregation. Therefore church meetings and\r\nvarious gatherings of committees were held at the deacon's house, and\r\nthe deacon's daughter saw him day after day, and grew more desperately\r\nin love. Desperate certainly she was when she dared even to think of\r\ngiving a love philter to a minister. The recipe was clearly printed on\r\nthe last page of an old dream book; and she carried it out in every\r\ndetail. It was easy to introduce it into the mug of flip which was\r\nalways brewed for the meeting, and the parson drank it down\r\nabstractedly, thinking that it seemed more bitter than usual, but\r\nshowing no sign of this thought. The philter was promised to have effect\r\nin making the drinker love profoundly the first person of opposite sex\r\nwhom he or she saw after drinking it; and of course the minister saw\r\nHannah as she stood waiting for his empty tankard. The dull details of\r\nparish work were talked over in the usual dragging way for half an\r\nhour, when the minister became conscious of an intense coldness which\r\nseemed to benumb him in every limb; and he tried to walk to the\r\nfireplace. Suddenly all in the room became aware that he was very ill,\r\nand one called out, \"He's got a stroke.\" Luckily the town doctor was\r\nalso a deacon, and was therefore present; and he promptly said, \"He's\r\npoisoned,\" and hot water from the teakettle, whites of eggs, mustard,\r\nand other domestic antidotes were administered with promptitude and\r\neffect. It is useless to detail the days of agony to the wretched girl,\r\nduring which the sick man wavered between life and death, nor her\r\ndevoted care of him. Soon after his recovery he solemnly proposed\r\nmarriage to her, and was refused. But he never wavered in his love for\r\nher; and every year he renewed his offer and told his wishes, to be met\r\never with a cold refusal, until ten years had passed; when into his\r\nbrain there entered a perception that her refusal had some extraordinary\r\nelement in it. Then, with a warmth of determination worthy a younger\r\nman, he demanded an explanation, and received a confession of the\r\npoisonous love philter. I suppose time had softened the memory of his\r\nsuffering, at any rate they were married--so the promise of the love\r\ncharm came true, after all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Gatherer of Simples.]\r\n\r\nAmos Bronson Alcott was another author of Concord, a sweet philosopher\r\nwhom I shall ever remember with deepest gratitude as the only person who\r\nin my early youth ever imagined any literary capacity in me (and in that\r\nhe was sadly mistaken, for he fancied I would be a poet). I have read\r\nvery faithfully all his printed writings, trying to believe him a great\r\nman, a seer; but I cannot, in spite of my gratitude for his flattering\r\nthough unfulfilled prophecy, discover in his books any profound signs of\r\ndepth or novelty of thought. In his _Tablets_ are some very pleasant, if\r\nnot surprisingly wise, essays on domestic subjects; one, on \"Sweet\r\nHerbs,\" tells cheerfully of the womanly care of the herb garden, but\r\nshows that, when written--about 1850--borders of herbs were growing\r\ninfrequent.\r\n\r\nOne great delight of old English gardens is never afforded us in New\r\nEngland; we do not grow Lavender beds. I have of course seen single\r\nplants of Lavender, so easily winter-killed, but I never have seen a\r\nLavender bed, nor do I know of one. It is a great loss. A bed or hedge\r\nof Lavender is pleasing in the same way that the dress of a Quaker lady\r\nis pleasing; it is reposeful, refined. It has a soft effect at the edge\r\nof a garden, like a blue-gray haze, and always reminds me of doves. The\r\npower of association or some inherent quality of the plant, makes\r\nLavender always suggest freshness and cleanliness.\r\n\r\nWe may linger a little with a few of these old herb favorites. One of\r\nthe most balmy and beautiful of all the sweet breaths borne by leaves or\r\nblossoms is that of Basil, which, alas! I see so seldom. I have always\r\nloved it, and can never pass it without pressing its leaves in my hand;\r\nand I cannot express the satisfaction, the triumph, with which I read\r\nthese light-giving lines of old Thomas Tusser, which showed me why I\r\nloved it:--\r\n\r\n    \"Faire Basil desireth it may be hir lot\r\n     To growe as the gilly flower trim in a pot\r\n     That Ladies and Gentils whom she doth serve\r\n     May help hir as needeth life to preserve.\"\r\n\r\nAn explanation of this rhyme is given by _Tusser Redivivus_: \"Most\r\npeople stroak Garden Basil which leaves a grateful smell on the hand and\r\nhe will have it that Stroaking from a fair lady preserves the life of\r\nthe Basil.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a striking example of floral telepathy; you know what the Basil\r\nwishes, and the Basil knows and craves your affection, and repays your\r\ncaress with her perfume and growth. It is a case of mutual attraction;\r\nand I beg the \"Gentle Reader\" never to pass a pot or plant of Basil\r\nwithout \"stroaking\" it; that it may grow and multiply and forever retain\r\nits relations with fair women, as a type of the purest, the most\r\nclinging, and grateful love.\r\n\r\nOne amusing use of Basil (as given in one of my daughter's old Herbals)\r\nwas intended to check obesity:--\r\n\r\n     \"TO MAKE THAT A WOMAN SHALL EAT OF NOTHING THAT IS SET UPON THE\r\n     TABLE:--Take a little green Basil, and when Men bring the Dishes to\r\n     the Table put it underneath them that the Woman perceive it not; so\r\n     Men say that she will eat of none of that which is in the Dish\r\n     whereunder the Basil lieth.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot understand why so sinister an association was given to a pot of\r\nBasil by Boccaccio, who makes the unhappy Isabella conceal the head of\r\nher murdered lover in a flower pot under a plant of Basil; for in Italy\r\nBasil is ever a plant of love, not of jealousy or crime. One of its\r\ncommon names is _Bacia, Nicola_--Kiss me, Nicholas. Peasant girls always\r\nplace Basil in their hair when they go to meet their sweethearts, and an\r\noffered sprig of Basil is a love declaration. It is believed that\r\nBoccaccio obtained this tale from some tradition of ancient Greece,\r\nwhere Basil is a symbol of hatred and despair. The figure of poverty was\r\nthere associated with a Basil plant as with rags. It had to be sown with\r\nabuse, with cursing and railing, else it would not flourish. In India\r\nits sanctity is above all other herbs. A pious Indian has at death a\r\nleaf of Basil placed in his bosom as his reward. The house surrounded by\r\nBasil is blessed, and all who cherish the plant are sure of heaven.\r\n\r\nMithridate was a favorite medicine of our Puritan ancestors; there were\r\nvarious elaborate compound rules for its manufacture, in which Rue\r\nalways took a part. It was simple enough in the beginning, when King\r\nMithridates invented it as an antidote against poison: twenty leaves of\r\nRue pounded with two Figs, two dried Walnuts and a grain of salt; which\r\nreceipt may be taken _cum grano salis_. Rue also entered into the\r\ncomposition of the famous \"Vinegar of the Four Thieves.\" These four\r\nrascals, at the time of the Plague in Marseilles, invented this vinegar,\r\nand, protected by its power, entered infected houses and carried away\r\nproperty without taking the disease. Rue had innumerable virtues. Pliny\r\nsays eighty-four remedies were made of it. It was of special use in case\r\nof venomous bites, and to counteract \"Head-Ach\" from over indulgence in\r\nwine, especially if a little Sage were added. It promoted love in man\r\nand diminished it in woman; it was good for the ear-ache, eye-ache,\r\nstomach-ache, leg-ache, back-ache; good for an ague, good for a surfeit;\r\nindeed, it would seem wise to make Rue a daily article of food and thus\r\ninsure perpetual good health.\r\n\r\nThe scent of Rue seems never dying. A sprig of it was given me by a\r\nfriend, and it chanced to lie for a single night on the sheets of paper\r\nupon which this chapter is written. The scent has never left them, and\r\nindeed the odor of Rue hangs literally around this whole book.\r\n\r\nSummer Savory and Sweet Marjoram are rarely employed now in American\r\ncooking. They are still found in my kitchen, and are used in scant\r\namount as a flavoring for stuffing of fowl. Many who taste and like the\r\nresult know not the old-fashioned materials used to produce that flavor,\r\nand \"of the younger sort\" the names even are wholly unrecognized.\r\n\r\nSage is almost the only plant of the English kitchen garden which is\r\nordinarily grown in America. I like its fresh grayness in the garden. In\r\nthe days of our friend John Gerarde, the beloved old herbalist, there\r\nwas no fixed botanical nomenclature; but he scarcely needed botanical\r\nterms, for he had a most felicitous and dextrous use of words. \"Sage\r\nhath broad leaves, long, wrinkled, rough, and whitish, like in roughness\r\nto woollen cloth threadbare.\" What a description! it is far more vivid\r\nthan the picture here shown. Sage has never lost its established place\r\nas a flavoring for the stuffing for ducks, geese, and for sausages; but\r\nits universal employment as a flavoring for Sage cheese is nearly\r\nobsolete. In my childhood home, we always had Sage cheese with other\r\ncheeses; it was believed to be an aid in digestion. I had forgotten its\r\ntaste; and I must say I didn't like it when I ate it last summer, in New\r\nHampshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Our Friend, John Gerarde.]\r\n\r\nTansy was highly esteemed in England as a medicine, a cosmetic, and a\r\nflavoring and ingredient in cooking. It was rubbed over raw meat to keep\r\nthe flies away and prevent decay, for in those days of no refrigerators\r\nthere had to be strong measures taken for the preservation of all\r\nperishable food. Its strong scent and taste would be deemed intolerable\r\nto us, who can scarce endure even the milder Sage in any large quantity.\r\nA good folk name for it is \"Bitter Buttons.\" Gerarde wrote of Tansy, \"In\r\nthe spring time, are made with the leaves hereof newly sprung up, and\r\nwith Eggs, cakes or Tansies, which be pleasant in Taste and goode for\r\nthe Stomach.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sage.]\r\n\r\n\"To Make a Tansie the Best Way,\" I learn from _The Accomplisht Cook_,\r\nwas thus:--\r\n\r\n     \"Take twenty Eggs, and take away five whites, strain them with a\r\n     quart of good sweet thick Cream, and put to it a grated nutmeg, a\r\n     race of ginger grated, as much cinnamon beaten fine, and a penny\r\n     white loaf grated also, mix them all together with a little salt,\r\n     then stamp some green wheat with some tansie herbs, strain it into\r\n     the cream and eggs and stir all together; then take a clean\r\n     frying-pan, and a quarter of a pound of butter, melt it, and put in\r\n     the tansie, and stir it continually over the fire with a slice,\r\n     ladle, or saucer, chop it, and break it as it thickens, and being\r\n     well incorporated put it out of the pan into a dish, and chop it\r\n     very fine; then make the frying-pan very clean, and put in some\r\n     more butter, melt it, and fry it whole or in spoonfuls; being\r\n     finely fried on both sides, dish it up and sprinkle it with\r\n     rose-vinegar, grape-verjuyce, elder-vinegar, cowslip-vinegar, or\r\n     the juyce of three or four oranges, and strow on a good store of\r\n     fine sugar.\"\r\n\r\nTo all of this we can say that it would certainly be a very good\r\ndish--without the Tansy. Another mediaeval recipe was of Tansy, Feverfew,\r\nParsley, and Violets mixed with eggs, fried in butter, and sprinkled\r\nwith sugar.\r\n\r\nThe Minnow-Tansie of old Izaak Walton, a \"Tanzie for Lent,\" was made\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n     \"Being well washed with salt and cleaned, and their heads and tails\r\n     cut off, and not washed after, they prove excellent for that use;\r\n     that is being fried with the yolks of eggs, the flowers of cowslips\r\n     and of primroses, and a little tansy, thus used they make a dainty\r\n     dish.\"\r\n\r\nThe name Tansy was given afterward to a rich fruit cake which had no\r\nTansy in it. It was apparently a favorite dish of Pepys. A certain\r\nderivative custom obtained in some New England towns--certainly in\r\nHartford and vicinity. Tansy was used to flavor the Fast Day pudding.\r\nOne old lady recalls that it was truly a bitter food to the younger\r\nmembers of the family; Miss Shelton, in her entertaining book, _The Salt\r\nBox House_, tells of Tansy cakes, and says children did not dislike\r\nthem. Tansy bitters were made of Tansy leaves placed in a bottle with\r\nNew England rum. They were a favorite spring tonic, where all physicians\r\nand housewives prescribed \"the bitter principle\" in the spring time.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Tansy was among the earliest plants brought over by the\r\nsettlers; it was carefully cherished in the herb garden, then spread to\r\nthe dooryard and then to farm lanes. As early as 1746 the traveller Kalm\r\nnoted Tansy growing wild in hedges and along roads in Pennsylvania. Now\r\nit extends its sturdy growth for miles along the country road, one of\r\nthe rankest of weeds. It still is used in the manufacture of proprietary\r\nmedicines, and for this purpose is cut with a sickle in great armfuls\r\nand gathered in cartloads. I have always liked its scent; and its\r\nleaves, as Gerarde said, \"infinitely jagged and nicked and curled\"; and\r\nits cheerful little \"bitter buttons\" of gold. Some old flowers adapt\r\nthemselves to modern conditions and look up-to-date; but to me the\r\nTansy, wherever found, is as openly old-fashioned as a betty-lamp or a\r\nfoot-stove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tansy.]\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1846, an old grave was opened in the ancient \"God's Acre\"\r\nnear the halls of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This\r\ngrave was a brick vault covered with irregularly shaped flagstones about\r\nthree inches thick. Over it was an ancient slab of peculiar stone,\r\nunlike any others in the cemetery save those over the graves of two\r\npresidents of the College, Rev. Dr. Chauncy and Dr. Oakes. As there were\r\nheadstones near this slab inscribed with the names of the\r\ngreat-grandchildren of President Dunster, it was believed that this was\r\nthe grave of a third President, Dr. Dunster. He died in the year 1659;\r\nbut his death took place in midwinter; and when this coffin was opened,\r\nthe skeleton was found entirely surrounded with common Tansy, in seed, a\r\nportion of which had been pulled up by the roots, and it was therefore\r\nbelieved by many who thought upon the matter that it was the coffin and\r\ngrave of President Mitchell, who died in July, 1668, of \"an extream\r\nfever.\" The skeleton was found still wrapped in a cerecloth, and in the\r\nrecord of the church is a memorandum of payment \"for a terpauling to\r\nwrap Mr. Mitchell.\" The Tansy found in this coffin, placed there more\r\nthan two centuries ago, still retained its shape and scent.\r\n\r\nThis use of Tansy at funerals lingered long in country neighborhoods in\r\nNew England, in some vicinities till fifty years ago. To many older\r\npersons the Tansy is therefore so associated with grewsome sights and\r\nsad scenes, that they turn from it wherever seen, and its scent to them\r\nis unbearable. One elderly friend writes me: \"I never see the leaves of\r\nTansy without recalling also the pale dead faces I have so often seen\r\nencircled by the dank, ugly leaves. Often as a child have I been sent to\r\ngather all the Tansy I could find, to be carried by my mother to the\r\nhouse of mourning; and I gathered it, loathing to touch it, but not\r\ndaring to refuse, and I loathe it still.\"\r\n\r\nTansy not only retains its scent for a long period, but the \"golden\r\nbuttons\" retain their color; I have seen them in New England parlors\r\nforming part of a winter posy; this, I suppose, in neighborhoods where\r\nTansy was little used at funerals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden of Mrs. Abraham Lansing, Albany, New York.]\r\n\r\nIf an herb garden had no other reason for existence, let me commend it\r\nto the attention of those of ample grounds and kindly hearts, for a\r\nspecial purpose--as a garden for the blind. Our many flower-charities\r\nfurnish flowers throughout the summer to our hospitals, but what\r\nsweet-scented flowers are there for those debarred from any sight of\r\nbeauty? Through the past summer my daughters sent several times a week,\r\nby the generous carriage of the Long Island Express Company, boxes of\r\nwild flowers to any hospital of their choice. What could we send to the\r\nblind? The midsummer flowers of field and meadow gratified the sight,\r\nbut scent was lacking. A sprig of Sweet Fern or Bayberry was the only\r\nresource. Think of the pleasure which could be given to the sightless by\r\na posy of sweet-scented leaves, by Southernwood, Mint, Balm, or Basil,\r\nand when memory was thereby awakened in those who once had seen, what\r\ntender thoughts! If this book could influence the planting of an herb\r\ngarden for the solace of those who cannot see the flowers of field and\r\ngarden, then it will not have been written in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nIN LILAC TIDE\r\n\r\n    \"Ere Man is aware\r\n     That the Spring is here\r\n     The Flowers have found it out.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Ancient Chinese Saying._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A flower opens, and lo! another Year,\" is the beautiful and suggestive\r\nlegend on an old vessel found in the Catacombs. Since these words were\r\nwritten, how many years have begun! how many flowers have opened! and\r\nyet nature has never let us weary of spring and spring flowers. My\r\ngarden knows well the time o' the year. It needs no almanac to count the\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n    \"The untaught Spring is wise\r\n     In Cowslips and Anemonies.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I sit shivering, idling, wondering when I can \"start the\r\ngarden\"--lo, there are Snowdrops and spring starting up to greet me.\r\n\r\nEver in earliest spring are there days when there is no green in grass,\r\ntree, or shrub; but when the garden lover is conscious that winter is\r\ngone and spring is waiting. There is in every garden, in every\r\ndooryard, as in the field and by the roadside, in some indefinable way a\r\nlook of spring. One hint of spring comes even before its flowers--you\r\ncan smell its coming. The snow is gone from the garden walks and some of\r\nthe open beds; you walk warily down the softened path at midday, and you\r\nsmell the earth as it basks in the sun, and a faint scent comes from\r\nsome twigs and leaves. Box speaks of summer, not of spring; and the\r\nfragrance from that Cedar tree is equally suggestive of summer. But\r\nbreak off that slender branch of Calycanthus--how fresh and welcome its\r\ndelightful spring scent. Carry it into the house with branches of\r\nForsythia, and how quickly one fills its leaf buds and the other\r\nblossoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ladies' Delights.]\r\n\r\nFor several years the first blossom of the new year in our garden was\r\nneither the Snowdrop nor Crocus, but the Ladies' Delight, that laughing,\r\nspeaking little garden face, which is not really a spring flower, it is\r\na stray from summer; but it is such a shrewd, intelligent little\r\ncreature that it readily found out that spring was here ere man or other\r\nflowers knew it. This dear little primitive of the Pansy tribe has\r\nbecome wonderfully scarce save in cherished old gardens like those of\r\nSalem, where I saw this year a space thirty feet long and several feet\r\nwide, under flowering shrubs and bushes, wholly covered with the\r\neveryday, homely little blooms of Ladies' Delights. They have the\r\nparty-colored petal of the existing strain of English Pansies, distinct\r\nfrom the French and German Pansies, and I doubt not are the descendants\r\nof the cherished garden children of the English settlers. Gerarde\r\ndescribes this little English Pansy or Heartsease in 1587 under the name\r\nof _Viola tricolor_:--\r\n\r\n     \"The flouers in form and figure like the Violet, and for the most\r\n     part of the same Bignesse, of three sundry colours, purple, yellow\r\n     and white or blew, by reason of the beauty and braverie of which\r\n     colours they are very pleasing to the eye, for smel they have\r\n     little or none.\"\r\n\r\nIn Breck's _Book of Flowers_, 1851, is the first printed reference\r\nI find to the flower under the name Ladies' Delight. In my\r\nchildhood I never heard it called aught else; but it has a score\r\nof folk names, all testifying to an affectionate intimacy: Bird's-eye;\r\nGarden-gate; Johnny-jump-up; None-so-pretty; Kitty-come; Kit-run-about;\r\nThree-faces under-a-hood; Come-and-cuddle-me; Pink-of-my-Joan;\r\nKiss-me; Tickle-my-fancy; Kiss-me-ere-I rise; Jump-up-and-kiss-me.\r\nTo our little flower has also been given this folk name,\r\nMeet-her-in-the-entry-kiss-her-in-the-buttery, the longest\r\nplant name in the English language, rivalled only by Miss\r\nJekyll's triumph of nomenclature for the Stonecrop, namely:\r\nWelcome-home-husband-be-he-ever-so-drunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden House in Garden of Hon. William H. Seward, Auburn,\r\nNew York.]\r\n\r\nThese little Ladies' Delights have infinite variety of expression; some\r\nare laughing and roguish, some sharp and shrewd, some surprised, others\r\nworried, all are animated and vivacious, and a few saucy to a degree.\r\nThey are as companionable as people--nay, more; they are as\r\ncompanionable as children. No wonder children love them; they recognize\r\nkindred spirits. I know a child who picked unbidden a choice Rose, and\r\nhid it under her apron. But as she passed a bed of Ladies' Delights\r\nblowing in the wind, peering, winking, mocking, she suddenly threw the\r\nRose at them, crying out pettishly, \"Here! take your old flower!\"\r\n\r\nThe Dandelion is to many the golden seal of spring, but it blooms the\r\nwhole circle of the year in sly garden corners and in the grass. Of it\r\nmight have been written the lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"It smiles upon the lap of May,\r\n       To sultry August spreads its charms,\r\n     Lights pale October on its way,\r\n       And twines December's arms.\"\r\n\r\nI have picked both Ladies' Delights and Dandelions every month in the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial in Garden of Hon. William H. Seward, Auburn, New\r\nYork.]\r\n\r\nI suppose the common Crocus would not be deemed a very great garden\r\nornament in midsummer, in its lowly growth; but in its spring blossoming\r\nit is--to use another's words--\"most gladsome of the early flowers.\" A\r\nbed of Crocuses is certainly a keen pleasure, glowing in the sun, almost\r\nas grateful to the human eye as to the honey-gathering bees that come\r\nunerringly, from somewhere, to hover over the golden cups. How welcome\r\nafter winter is the sound of that humming.\r\n\r\nIn the garden's story, there are ever a few pictures which stand out\r\nwith startling distinctness. When the year is gone you do not recall\r\nmany days nor many flowers with precision; often a single flower seems\r\nof more importance than a whole garden. In the day book of 1900 I have\r\nbut few pictures; the most vivid was the very first of the season. It\r\ncould have been no later than April, for one or two Snowdrops still\r\nshowed white in the grass, when a splendid ribbon of Chionodoxa--Glory\r\nof the Snow--opened like blue fire burning from plant to plant, the\r\nbluest thing I ever saw in any garden. It was backed with solid masses\r\nof equally vivid yellow Alyssum and chalk-white Candy-tuft, both of\r\nwhich had had a good start under glass in a temporary forcing bed. These\r\nthree solid masses of color surrounded by bare earth and showing little\r\ngreen leafage made my eyes ache, but a picture was burnt in which will\r\nnever leave my brain. I always have a sense of importance, of actual\r\nownership of a plant, when I can recall its introduction--as I do of the\r\nChionodoxa, about 1871. It is said to come up and bloom in the snow, but\r\nI have never seen it in blossom earlier than March, and never then\r\nunless the snow has vanished. It has much of the charm of its relative,\r\nthe Scilla.\r\n\r\nWe all have flower favorites, and some of us have flower antipathies, or\r\nat least we are indifferent to certain flowers; but I never knew any one\r\nbut loved the Daffodil. Not only have poets and dramatists sung it, but\r\nit is a common favorite, as shown by its homely names in our everyday\r\nspeech. I am always touched in _Endymion_ that the only flowers named as\r\n\"a thing of beauty that is a joy forever\" are Daffodils \"with the green\r\nworld they live in.\"\r\n\r\nIn Daffodils I like the \"old fat-headed sort with nutmeg and cinnamon\r\nsmell and old common English names--Butter-and-eggs, Codlins-and-cream,\r\nBacon and eggs.\" The newer ones are more slender in bud and bloom, more\r\ntrumpet-shaped, and are commonplace of name instead of common. In\r\nVirginia the name of a variety has become applied to a family, and all\r\nDaffodils are called Butter-and-eggs by the people.\r\n\r\nOn spring mornings the Tulips fairly burn with a warmth, which makes\r\nthem doubly welcome after winter. Emerson--ever able to draw a picture\r\nin two lines--to show the heart of everything in a single sentence--thus\r\npaints them:--\r\n\r\n    \"The gardens fire with a joyful blaze\r\n     Of Tulips in the morning's rays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tulipase do carry so stately and delightful a form, and do abide so\r\nlong in their bravery, that there is no Lady or Gentleman of any worth\r\nthat is not caught with this delight,\"--wrote the old herbalist\r\nParkinson. Bravery is an ideal expression for Tulips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lilacs in Midsummer in Garden of Mrs. Abraham Lansing,\r\nAlbany, New York.]\r\n\r\nIt is with something of a shock that we read the words of Philip\r\nHamerton in _The Sylvan Year_, that nature is not harmonious in the\r\nspring, but is only in the way of becoming so. He calls it the time of\r\ncrudities, like the adolescence of the mind. He says, \"The green is\r\ngood for us, and we welcome it with uncritical gladness; but when we\r\nthink of painting, it may be doubted whether any season of the year is\r\nless propitious to the broad and noble harmonies which are the secrets\r\nof all grand effects in art.\" And he compares the season to the\r\nuncomfortable hour in a household when the early risers are walking\r\nabout, not knowing what to do with themselves, while others have not yet\r\ncome down to breakfast.\r\n\r\nI must confess that an undiversified country landscape in spring has\r\nupon me the effect asserted by Hamerton. I recall one early spring week\r\nin the Catskills, when I fairly complained, \"Everything is so green\r\nhere.\" I longed for rocks, water, burnt fields, bare trees, anything to\r\nbreak that glimmering green of new grass and new Birches. But in the\r\nspring garden there is variety of shape and color; the Peony leaf buds\r\nare red, some sprouting leaves are pink, and there are vast varieties of\r\nbrown and gray and gold in leaf.\r\n\r\nLet me give the procession of spring in the garden in the words of a\r\nlover of old New England flowers, Dr. Holmes. It is a vivid word picture\r\nof the distinctive forms and colors of budding flowers and leaves.\r\n\r\n    \"At first the snowdrop's bells are seen,\r\n       Then close against the sheltering wall\r\n     The tulip's horn of dusky green,\r\n       The peony's dark unfolding ball.\r\n\r\n    \"The golden-chaliced crocus burns;\r\n       The long narcissus blades appear;\r\n     The cone-beaked hyacinth returns\r\n       To light her blue-flamed chandelier.\r\n\r\n    \"The willow's whistling lashes, wrung\r\n       By the wild winds of gusty March,\r\n     With sallow leaflets lightly strung,\r\n       Are swaying by the tufted larch.\r\n\r\n    \"See the proud tulip's flaunting cup,\r\n       That flames in glory for an hour,--\r\n     Behold it withering, then look up--\r\n       How meek the forest-monarchs flower!\r\n\r\n    \"When wake the violets, Winter dies;\r\n       When sprout the elm buds, Spring is near;\r\n     When lilacs blossom, Summer cries,\r\n       'Bud, little roses, Spring is here.'\"\r\n\r\nThe universal flower in the old-time garden was the Lilac; it was the\r\nmost beloved bloom of spring, and gave a name to Spring--Lilac tide. The\r\nLilac does not promise \"spring is coming\"; it is the emblem of the\r\n_presence_ of spring. Dr. Holmes says, \"When Lilacs blossom, Summer\r\ncries, '_Spring is here_'\" in every cheerful and lavish bloom. Lilacs\r\nshade the front yard; Lilacs grow by the kitchen doorstep; Lilacs spring\r\nup beside the barn; Lilacs shade the well; Lilacs hang over the spring\r\nhouse; Lilacs crowd by the fence side and down the country road. In many\r\ncolonial dooryards it was the only shrub--known both to lettered and\r\nunlettered folk as Laylock, and spelt Laylock too. Walter Savage Landor,\r\nwhen Laylock had become antiquated, still clung to the word, and used it\r\nwith a stubborn persistence such as he alone could compass, and which\r\nseems strange in the most finished classical scholar of his day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lilacs at Craigie House, the Home of Longfellow.]\r\n\r\n\"I shall not go to town while the Lilacs bloom,\" wrote Longfellow; and\r\nwhat Lilac lover could have left a home so Lilac-embowered as Craigie\r\nHouse! A view of its charms in Lilac tide is given in outline on this\r\npage; the great Lilac trees seem wondrously suited to the fine old\r\nRevolutionary mansion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box-edged Garden at the Home of Longfellow.]\r\n\r\nThere is in Albany, New York, a lovely garden endeared to those who know\r\nit through the memory of a presence that lighted all places associated\r\nwith it with the beauty of a noble life. It is the garden of the home of\r\nMrs. Abraham Lansing, and was planted by her father and mother, General\r\nand Mrs. Peter Gansevoort, in 1846, having been laid out with taste and\r\nan art that has borne the test of over half a century's growth. In the\r\ngarden are scores of old-time favorites: Flower de Luce, Peonies,\r\nDaffodils, and snowy Phlox; but instead of bending over the flower\r\nborders, let us linger awhile in the wonderful old Lilac walk. It is a\r\nglory of tender green and shaded amethyst and grateful hum of bees, the\r\nvery voice of Spring. Every sense is gratified, even that of touch, when\r\nthe delicate plumes of the fragrant Lilac blossoms brush your cheek as\r\nyou walk through its path; there is no spot of fairer loveliness than\r\nthis Lilac walk in May. It is a wonderful study of flickering light and\r\ngrateful shade in midsummer. Look at its full-leaf charms opposite page\r\n138; was there ever anything lovelier in any garden, at any time, than\r\nthe green vista of this Lilac walk in July? But for the thoughtful\r\ngarden-lover it has another beauty still, the delicacy and refinement of\r\noutline when the Lilac walk is bare of foliage, as is shown on page 220\r\nand facing page 154. The very spirit of the Lilacs seems visible, etched\r\nwith a purity of touch that makes them sentient, speaking beings,\r\ninstead of silent plants. See the outlines of stem and branch against\r\nthe tender sky of this April noon. Do you care for color when you have\r\nsuch beauty of outline? Surely this Lilac walk is loveliest in April,\r\nwith a sensitive etherealization beyond compare. How wonderfully these\r\npictures have caught the look of tentative spring--spring waiting for a\r\nsingle day to burst into living green. There is an ancient Saxon name\r\nfor springtime--Opyn-tide--thus defined by an old writer, \"Whenne that\r\nflowres think on blowen\"--when the flowers begin to think of budding and\r\nblowing; and so I name this picture Opyn-tide, the Thought of Spring.\r\n\r\nFor many years Lilacs were planted for hedges; they were seldom\r\nsatisfactory if clipped, for the broad-spreading leaves were always gray\r\nwith dust, and they often had a \"rust\" which wholly destroyed their\r\nbeauty. The finest clipped Lilac hedge I ever saw is at Indian Hill,\r\nNewburyport. It was set out about 1850, and is compact and green as\r\nPrivet; the leaves are healthy, and the growth perfect down to the\r\nground; it is an unusual example of Lilac growth--a perfect hedge. An\r\nunclipped Lilac hedge is lovely in its blooming; a beautiful one grows\r\nby the side of the old family home of Mr. Mortimer Howell at West\r\nHampton Beach, Long Island. To this hedge in May come a-begging dusky\r\ncity flower venders, who break off and carry away wagon loads of blooms.\r\nAs the fare from and to New York is four dollars, and a wagon has to be\r\nhired to convey the flowers from the hedge two miles to the railroad\r\nstation, there must be a high price charged for these Lilacs to afford\r\nany profit; but the Italian flower sellers appear year after year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Joepye-weed and Queen Anne's Lace.]\r\n\r\nLilacs bloom not in our ancient literature; they are not named by\r\nShakespeare, nor do I recall any earlier mention of them than in the\r\nessay of Lord Bacon on \"Gardens,\" published about 1610, where he spelled\r\nit Lelacke. Blue-pipe tree was the ancient name of the Lilac, a reminder\r\nof the time when pipes were made of its wood; I heard it used in modern\r\nspeech once. An old Narragansett coach driver called out to me, \"Ye set\r\nsuch store on flowers, don't ye want to pick that Blue-pipe in Pender\r\nZeke's garden?\"--a deserted garden and home at Pender Zeke's Corner.\r\nThis man had some of the traits of Mrs. Wright's delightful\r\n\"Time-o'-Day,\" and he knew well my love of flowers; for he had been my\r\ncharioteer to the woods where Rhododendron and Rhodora bloom, and he had\r\nrevealed to me the pond where grew the pink Water Lilies. And from a\r\nchance remark of mine he had conveyed to me a wagon load of Joepye-weed\r\nand Boneset, to the dismay of my younger children, who had apprehensions\r\nof unlimited gallons of herb tea therefrom. Let me steal a few lines\r\nfrom my spring Lilacs to write of these two \"Sisters of Healing,\" which\r\nwere often planted in the household herb garden. From July to September\r\nin the low lying meadows of every state from the Bay of Fundy to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, can be found Joepye-weed and Boneset. The dull pink\r\nclusters of soft fringy blooms of Joepye-weed stand up three to eight\r\nfeet in height above the moist earth, catching our eye and the visit of\r\nevery passing butterfly, and commanding attention for their fragrance,\r\nand a certain dignity of carriage notable even among the more striking\r\nhues of the brilliant Goldenrod and vivid Sunflowers. Joe Pye was an\r\nIndian medicine-man of old New England, famed among his white neighbors\r\nfor his skill in curing the devastating typhoid fevers which, in those\r\ndays of no drainage and ignorance of sanitation, vied with so-called\r\n\"hereditary\" consumption in exterminating New England families. His\r\ncure-all was a bitter tea decocted from leaves and stalks of this\r\n_Eupatorium purpureum_, and in token of his success the plant bears\r\neverywhere his name, but it is now wholly neglected by the simpler and\r\nherb-doctor. The sister plant, the _Eupatorium perfoliatum_, known as\r\nThoroughwort, Boneset, Ague-weed, or Indian Sage, grows everywhere by\r\nits side, and is also used in fevers. It was as efficacious in \"break\r\nbone fever\" in the South a century ago as it is now for the grippe, for\r\nit still is used, North and South, in many a country home. Neltje\r\nBlanchan and Mrs. Dana Parsons call Thoroughwort or Boneset tea a\r\n\"nauseous draught,\" and I thereby suspect that neither has tasted it. I\r\nhave many a time, and it has a clear, clean bitter taste, no stronger\r\nthan any bitter beer or ale. Every year is Boneset gathered in old\r\nNarragansett; but swamp edges and meadows that are easy of access have\r\nbeen depleted of the stately growth of saw-edged wrinkled leaves, and\r\nthe Boneset gatherer must turn to remote brooksides and inaccessible\r\nmeadows for his harvest. The flat-topped terminal cymes of leaden white\r\nblooms are not distinctive as seen from afar, and many flowers of\r\nsimilar appearance lure the weary simpler here and there, until at last\r\nthe welcome sight of the connate perfoliate leaves, surrounding the\r\nstrong stalk, distinctive of the Boneset, show that his search is\r\nrewarded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boneset.]\r\n\r\nAfter these bitter draughts of herb tea, we will turn, as do children,\r\nto sweets, to our beloved Lilac blooms. The Lilac has ever been a flower\r\nwelcomed by English-speaking folk since it first came to England by the\r\nhand of some mariner. It is said that a German traveller named Busbeck\r\nbrought it from the Orient to the continent in the sixteenth century. I\r\nknow not when it journeyed to the new world, but long enough ago so that\r\nit now grows cheerfully and plentifully in all our states of temperate\r\nclime and indeed far south. It even grows wild in some localities,\r\nthough it never looks wild, but plainly shows its escape or exile from\r\nsome garden. It is specially beloved in New England, and it seems so\r\nmuch more suited in spirit to New England than to Persia that it ought\r\nreally to be a native plant. Its very color seems typical of New\r\nEngland; some parts of celestial blue, with more of warm pink, blended\r\nand softened by that shading of sombre gray ever present in New England\r\nlife into a distinctive color known everywhere as lilac--a color\r\ngrateful, quiet, pleasing, what Thoreau called a \"tender, civil,\r\ncheerful color.\" Its blossoming at the time of Election Day, that\r\nall-important New England holiday, gave it another New England\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nThere is no more emblematic flower to me than the Lilac; it has an\r\nassociation of old homes, of home-making and home interests. On the\r\ncountry farm, in the village garden, and in the city yard, the lilac was\r\nplanted wherever the home was made, and it attached itself with deepest\r\nroots, lingering sometimes most sadly but sturdily, to show where the\r\nhome once stood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Magnolias.]\r\n\r\nLet me tell of two Lilacs of sentiment. One of them is shown on page\r\n149; a glorious Lilac tree which is one of a group of many\r\nfull-flowered, pale-tinted ones still growing and blossoming each spring\r\non a deserted homestead in old Narragansett. They bloom over the grave\r\nof a fine old house, and the great chimney stands sadly in their midst\r\nas a gravestone. \"Hopewell,\" ill-suited of name, was the home of a\r\nNarragansett Robinson famed for good cheer, for refinement and luxury,\r\nand for a lovely garden, laid out with cost and care and filled with\r\nrare shrubs and flowers. Perhaps these Lilacs were a rare variety in\r\ntheir day, being pale of tint; now they are as wild as their\r\ncompanions, the Cedar hedges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lilacs at Hopewell.]\r\n\r\nGathering in the front dooryard of a fallen farm-house some splendid\r\nbranches of flowering Lilac, I found a few feet of cellar wall and\r\nwooden house side standing, and the sills of two windows. These window\r\nsills, exposed for years to the bleaching and fading of rain and sun and\r\nfrost, still bore the circular marks of the flower pots which, filled\r\nwith houseplants, had graced the kitchen windows for many a winter under\r\nthe care of a flower-loving house mistress. A few days later I learned\r\nfrom a woman over ninety years of age--an inmate of the \"Poor\r\nHouse\"--the story of the home thus touchingly indicated by the Lilac\r\nbushes and the stains of the flower pots. Over eighty years ago she had\r\nbrought the tiny Lilac-slip to her childhood's home, then standing in a\r\nclearing in the forest. She carried it carefully in her hands as she\r\nrode behind her father on a pillion after a visit to her grandmother.\r\nShe and her little brothers and sisters planted the tiny thing \"of two\r\neyes only,\" as she said, in the shadow of the house, in the little front\r\nyard. And these children watered it and watched it, as it rooted and\r\ngrew, till the house was surrounded each spring with its vivacious\r\nblooms, its sweet fragrance. The puny slip has outlived the house and\r\nall its inmates save herself, outlived the brothers and sisters, their\r\nchildren and grandchildren, outlived orchard and garden and field. And\r\nit will live to tell a story to every thoughtful passer-by till a second\r\ngrowth of forest has arisen in pasture and garden and even in the\r\ncellar-hole, when even then the cheerful Lilac will not be wholly\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\nA bunch of early Lilacs was ever a favorite gift to \"teacher,\" to be\r\nplaced in a broken-nosed pitcher on her desk. And Lilac petals made such\r\nlovely necklaces, thrust within each other or strung with needle and\r\nthread. And there was a love divination by Lilacs which we children\r\nsolemnly observed. There will occasionally appear a tiny Lilac flower,\r\nusually a white Lilac, with five divisions of the petal instead of\r\nfour--this is a Luck Lilac. This must be solemnly swallowed. If it goes\r\ndown smoothly, the dabbler in magic cries out, \"He loves me;\" if she\r\nchokes at her floral food, she must say sadly, \"He loves me not.\" I\r\nremember once calling out, with gratification and pride, \"He loves me!\"\r\n\"Who is he?\" said my older companions. \"Oh, I didn't know he had to be\r\nsomebody,\" I answered in surprise, to be met by derisive laughter at my\r\nsatisfaction with a lover in general and not in particular. It was a\r\nmatter of Lilac-luck-etiquette that the lover's name should be\r\npronounced mentally before the petal was swallowed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Persian Lilacs and Peonies in Garden of the Kimball\r\nHomestead, Portsmouth, New Hampshire.]\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies the Lilac is a flower of mysterious power; its\r\nperfume keeps away evil spirits, ghosts, banshees. If it grows not in\r\nthe dooryard, its protecting branches are hung over the doorway. I think\r\nof this when I see it shading the door of happy homes in New England.\r\n\r\nIn our old front yards we had only the common Lilacs, and occasionally\r\na white one; and as a rarity the graceful, but sometimes rather\r\nspindling, Persian Lilacs, known since 1650 in gardens, and shown on\r\npage 151. How the old gardens would have stared at the new double\r\nLilacs, which have luxuriant plumes of bloom twenty inches long.\r\n\r\nThe \"pensile Lilac\" has been sung by many poets; but the spirit of the\r\nflower has been best portrayed in verse by Elizabeth Akers. I can quote\r\nbut a single stanza from so many beautiful ones.\r\n\r\n    \"How fair it stood, with purple tassels hung,\r\n       Their hue more tender than the tint of Tyre;\r\n     How musical amid their fragrance rung\r\n       The bee's bassoon, keynote of spring's glad choir!\r\n     O languorous Lilac! still in time's despite\r\n     I see thy plumy branches all alight\r\n       With new-born butterflies which loved to stay\r\n       And bask and banquet in the temperate ray\r\n     Of springtime, ere the torrid heats should be:\r\n       For these dear memories, though the world grow gray,\r\n     I sing thy sweetness, lovely Lilac tree!\"\r\n\r\nAnother poet of the Lilac is Walt Whitman. He tells his delight in \"the\r\nLilac tall and its blossoms of mastering odor.\" He sings: \"with the\r\nbirds a warble of joy for Lilac-time.\" That noble, heroic dirge, the\r\n_Burial Hymn of Lincoln_, begins:--\r\n\r\n    \"When Lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet stood under the blossoming Lilacs when he learned of the death\r\nof Lincoln, and the scent and sight of the flowers ever bore the sad\r\nassociation. In this poem is a vivid description of--\r\n\r\n    \"The Lilac bush, tall growing, with heart-shaped leaves of rich green,\r\n     With many a pointed blossom, rising delicate with the perfume strong\r\n       I love.\r\n     With every leaf a miracle.\"\r\n\r\nThomas William Parsons could turn from his profound researches and\r\nloving translations of Dante to write with deep sympathy of the Lilac.\r\nHis verses have to me an additional interest, since I believe they were\r\nwritten in the house built by my ancestor in 1740, and occupied still by\r\nhis descendants. In its front dooryard are Lilacs still standing under\r\nthe windows of Dr. Parsons' room, in which he loved so to write.\r\n\r\nHawthorne felt a sort of \"ludicrous unfitness in the idea of a\r\ntime-stricken and grandfatherly Lilac bush.\" He was dissatisfied with\r\naged Lilacs, though he knew not whether his heart, judgment, or rural\r\nsense put him in that condition. He felt the flower should either\r\nflourish in immortal youth or die. Apple trees could grow old and feeble\r\nwithout his reproach, but an aged Lilac was improper.\r\n\r\nI fancy no one ever took any care of Lilacs in an old garden. As soon\r\nwater or enrich the Sumach and Elder growing by the roadside! But care\r\nfor your Lilacs nowadays, and see how they respond. Make them a _garden_\r\nflower, and you will never regret it. There be those who prefer grafted\r\nLilacs--the stock being usually a Syringa; they prefer the single trunk,\r\nand thus get rid of the Lilac suckers. But compare a row of grafted\r\nLilacs to a row of natural fastigate growth, as shown on page 220, and I\r\nthink nature must be preferred.\r\n\r\n\"Methinks I see my contemplative girl now in the garden watching the\r\ngradual approach of Spring,\" wrote Sterne. My contemplative girl lives\r\nin the city, how can she know that spring is here? Even on those few\r\nsquare feet of mother earth, dedicated to clotheslines and posts, spring\r\nsets her mark. Our Lilacs seldom bloom, but they put forth lovely fresh\r\ngreen leaves; and even the unrolling of the leaves of our Japanese ivies\r\nare a pleasure.\r\n\r\nOur poor little strips of back yard in city homes are apt to be too\r\ndensely shaded for flower blooms, but some things will grow, even there.\r\nSome wild flowers will live, and what a delight they are in spring. We\r\nhave a Jack-in-the-pulpit who comes up just as jauntily there as in the\r\nwild woods; Dog-tooth Violet and our common wild Violet also bloom. A\r\ncity neighbor has Trillium which blossoms each year; our Trillium shows\r\nleaves, but no blossoms, and does not increase in spread of roots.\r\nBloodroot, a flower so shy when gathered in the woods, and ever loving\r\ndamp sites, flourishes in the dryest flower bed, grows coarser in leaf\r\nand bloom, and blossoms earlier, and holds faster its snowy petals.\r\nCorydalis in the garden seems so garden-bred that you almost forget the\r\nflower was ever wild.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Opyn-tide, the Thought of Spring.]\r\n\r\nThe approach of spring in our city parks is marked by the appearance of\r\nthe Dandelion gatherers. It is always interesting to see, in May, on the\r\nclosely guarded lawns and field expanses of our city parks, the hundreds\r\nof bareheaded, gayly-dressed Italian and Portuguese women and children\r\neagerly gathering the young Dandelion plants to add to their meagre\r\nfare as a greatly-loved delicacy. They collect these \"greens\" in\r\nhighly-colored kerchiefs, in baskets, in squares of sheeting; I have\r\nseen the women bearing off a half-bushel of plants; even their stumpy\r\nlittle children are impressed to increase the welcome harvest, and with\r\na broken knife dig eagerly in the greensward. The thrifty park\r\ncommissioners, in Dandelion-time, relax their rigid rules, \"Keep Off the\r\nGrass,\" and turn the salad-loving Italians loose to improve the public\r\nlawns by freeing them from weeds.\r\n\r\nThe earliest sign of spring in the fields and woods in my childhood was\r\nthe appearance of the Willow catkins, and was heralded by the cry of one\r\nchild to another,--\"Pussy-willows are out.\" How eagerly did those who\r\nloved the woods and fields turn, after the storm, whiteness, and chill\r\nof a New England winter, to Pussy-willows as a promise of summer and\r\nsunshine. Some of their charm ever lingers to us as we see them in the\r\nbaskets of swarthy street venders in New York.\r\n\r\nMagnolia blossoms are sold in our city streets to remind city dwellers\r\nof spring. \"Every flower its own bow-kwet,\" is the call of the vender.\r\nBunches of Locust blossoms follow, awkwardly tied together. Though the\r\nMagnolia is earlier, I do not find it much more splendid as a flowering\r\ntree for the garden than our northern Dogwood; and the Dogwood when in\r\nbloom seems just as tropical. It is then the glory of the landscape; and\r\nits radiant starry blossoms turn into ideal beauty even our sombre\r\ncemeteries.\r\n\r\nThe Magnolia has been planted in northern gardens for over a century.\r\nGardens on Long Island have many beautiful old specimens, doubtless\r\nfurnished by the Prince Nurseries. These seem thoroughly at home; just\r\nas does the Locust brought from Virginia, a century ago, by one Captain\r\nSands of Sands Point, to please his Virginia bride with the presence of\r\nthe trees of her girlhood's home. These Locusts have spread over every\r\nrood of Long Island earth, and seem as much at home as Birch or Willow.\r\nThe three Magnolia trees on Mr. Brown's lawn in Flatbush are as large as\r\nany I know in the North, and were exceptionally full of bloom this year,\r\nthis photograph (shown facing page 148) being taken when they were past\r\ntheir prime. I saw children eagerly gathering the waxy petals which had\r\nfallen, and which show so plainly in the picture. But the flower is not\r\ncommon enough here for northern children to learn the varied attractions\r\nof the Magnolia.\r\n\r\nThe flower lore of American children is nearly all of English\r\nderivation; but children invent as well as copy. In the South the lavish\r\ngrowth of the Magnolia affords multiform playthings. The beautiful broad\r\nwhite petals give a snowy surface for the inditing of messages or\r\nvalentines, which are written with a pin, when the letters turn dark\r\nbrown. The stamens of the flower--waxlike with red tips--make mock\r\nilluminating matches. The leaves shape into wonderful drinking cups, and\r\nthe scarlet seeds give a glowing necklace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Thought of Winter's Snows.]\r\n\r\nThe glories of a spring garden are not in the rows of flowering bulbs,\r\nbeautiful as they are; but in the flowering shrubs and trees. The old\r\ngarden had few shrubs, but it had unsurpassed beauty in its rows of\r\nfruit trees which in their blossoming give the spring garden, as here\r\nshown, that lovely whiteness which seems a blending of the seasons--a\r\nthought of winter's snows. The perfection of Apple blossoms I have told\r\nin another chapter. Earlier to appear was the pure white, rather chilly,\r\nblooms of the Plum tree, to the Japanese \"the eldest brother of an\r\nhundred flowers.\" They are faintly sweet-scented with the delicacy\r\nfound in many spring blossoms. A good example of the short verses of the\r\nJapanese poets tells of the Plum blossom and its perfume.\r\n\r\n    \"In springtime, on a cloudless night,\r\n       When moonbeams throw their silver pall\r\n       O'er wooded landscapes, veiling all\r\n     In one soft cloud of misty white,\r\n     'Twere vain almost to hope to trace\r\n       The Plum trees in their lovely bloom\r\n       Of argent; 'tis their sweet perfume\r\n     Alone which leads me to their place.\"\r\n\r\nThe lovely family of double white Plum blossoms which now graces our\r\ngardens is varied by tinted ones; there are sixty in all which the\r\nnineteenth century owes to Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Peach tree has a flower which has given name to one of the loveliest\r\ncolors in the world. The Peach has varieties with wonderful double\r\nflowers of glorious color. Cherry trees bear a more cheerful white\r\nflower than Plum trees.\r\n\r\n    \"The Cherry boughs above us spread\r\n       The whitest shade was ever seen;\r\n     And flicker, flicker came and fled\r\n       Sun-spots between.\"\r\n\r\nI do not recall the Judas tree in my childhood. I am told there were\r\nmany in Worcester; but there were none in our garden, nor in our\r\nneighborhood, and that was my world. Orchids might have hung from the\r\ntrees a mile from my home, and would have been no nearer me than the\r\ntropics. I had a small world, but it was large enough, since it was\r\nbounded by garden walls.\r\n\r\nAlmond trees are seldom seen in northern gardens; but the Flowering\r\nAlmond flourishes as one of the purest and loveliest familiar shrubs.\r\nSilvery pink in bloom when it opens, the pink darkens till when in full\r\nflower it is deeply rosy. It was, next to the Lilac, the favorite shrub\r\nof my childhood. I used to call the exquisite little blooms \"fairy\r\nroses,\" and there were many fairy tales relating to the Almond bush.\r\nThis made the flower enhaloed with sentiment and mystery, which charmed\r\nas much as its beauty. The Flowering Almond seemed to have a special\r\nplace under a window in country yards and gardens, as it is shown on\r\npage 39. A fitting spot it was, since it never grew tall enough to shade\r\nthe little window panes.\r\n\r\nWith Pussy-willows and Almond blossoms and Ladies' Delights, with\r\nblossoming playhouse Apple trees and sweet-scented Lilac walks, spring\r\nwas certainly Paradise in our childhood. Would it were an equally happy\r\nseason in mature years; but who, garden-bred, can walk in the springtime\r\nthrough the garden of her childhood without thought of those who cared\r\nfor the garden in its youth, and shared the care of their children with\r\nthe care of their flowers, but now are seen no more.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, far away in some serener air,\r\n     The eyes that loved them see a heavenly dawn:\r\n     How can they bloom without her tender care?\r\n     Why should they live when her sweet life is gone?\"\r\n\r\nI have written of the gladness of spring, but I know nothing more\r\noverwhelming than the heartache of spring, the sadness of a\r\nfresh-growing spring garden. Where is the dear one who planted it and\r\nloved it, and he who helped her in the care, and the loving child who\r\nplayed in it and left it in the springtime? All that is good and\r\nbeautiful has come again to us with the sunlight and warmth, save those\r\nwhom we still love but can see no more. By that very measure of\r\nhappiness poured for us in childhood in Lilac tide, is our cup of\r\nsadness now filled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nOLD FLOWER FAVORITES\r\n\r\n    \"God does not send us strange flowers every year.\r\n     When the spring winds blow o'er the pleasant places\r\n     The same dear things lift up the same fair faces;\r\n       The Violet is here.\r\n\r\n    \"It all comes back; the odor, grace, and hue\r\n     Each sweet relation of its life repeated;\r\n     No blank is left, no looking-for is cheated;\r\n       It is the thing we knew.\"\r\n\r\n    --ADELINE D. T. WHITNEY, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only do I love to see the same dear things year after year, and to\r\nwelcome the same odor, grace, and hue; but I love to find them in the\r\nsame places. I like a garden in which plants have been growing in one\r\nspot for a long time, where they have a fixed home and surroundings. In\r\nour garden the same flowers shoulder each other comfortably and crowd\r\neach other a little, year after year. They look, my sister says, like\r\nlong-established neighbors, like old family friends, not as if they had\r\njust \"moved in,\" and didn't know each other's names and faces. Plants\r\ngrow better when they are among flower friends. I suppose we have to\r\ntransplant some plants, sometimes; but I would try to keep old friends\r\ntogether even in those removals. They would be lonely when they opened\r\ntheir eyes after the winter's sleep, and saw strange flower forms and\r\nunknown faces around them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Larkspur and Phlox.]\r\n\r\nFor flowers have friendships, and antipathies as well. How Canterbury\r\nBells and Foxgloves love to grow side by side! And Sweet Williams, with\r\nFoxgloves, as here shown. And in my sister's garden Larkspur always\r\nstarts up by white Phlox--see a bit of the border on this page. Whatever\r\nmay influence these docile alliances, it isn't a proper sense of fitness\r\nof color; for Tiger Lilies dearly love to grow by crimson-purple Phlox,\r\na most inharmonious association, and you can hardly separate them. If a\r\nflower dislikes her neighbor in the garden, she moves quietly away, I\r\ndon't know where or how. Sometimes she dies, but at any rate she is\r\ngone. It is so queer; I have tried every year to make Feverfew grow in\r\nthis bed, and it won't do it, though it grows across the path. There is\r\nsome flower here that the pompous Feverfew doesn't care to associate\r\nwith. Not the Larkspur, for they are famous friends--perhaps it is the\r\nSweet William, who is rather a plain fellow. In general flowers are very\r\nsociable with each other, but they have some preferences, and these are\r\npowerful ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sweet William and Foxglove.]\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to read in no less than five recent English\r\n\"garden-books,\" by flower-loving souls, the solemn advice that if you\r\nwish a beautiful garden effect you \"must plant the great Oriental Poppy\r\nby the side of the White Lupine.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Thou say'st an undisputed thing\r\n     In such a solemn way.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is, you have very little to do with it. That Poppy chooses to\r\nkeep company with the White Lupine, and to that impulse you owe your\r\nfine garden effect. The Poppy is the slyest magician of the whole\r\ngarden. He comes and goes at will. This year a few blooms, nearly all in\r\none corner; next year a blaze of color banded across the middle of the\r\ngarden like the broad sash of a court chamberlain. Then a single grand\r\nblossom quite alone in the pansy bed, while another pushes up between\r\nthe tight close leaves of the box edging:--the Poppy is _queer_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plume Poppy.]\r\n\r\nSome flowers have such a hatred of man they cannot breathe and live in\r\nhis presence, others have an equal love of human companionship. The\r\nwhite Clover clings here to our pathway as does the English Daisy across\r\nseas. And in our garden Ladies' Delights and Ambrosia tell us, without\r\nwords, of their love for us and longing to be by our side; just as\r\nplainly as a child silently tells us his love and dependence on us by\r\ntaking our hand as we walk side by side. There is not another gesture of\r\nchildhood, not an affectionate word which ever touched my heart as did\r\nthat trustful holding of the hand. One of my children throughout his\r\nbrief life never walked by my side without clinging closely--I think\r\nwithout conscious intent--with his little hand to mine. I can never\r\nforget the affection, the trust of that vanished hand.\r\n\r\nI find that my dearest flower loves are the old flowers,--not only old\r\nto me because I knew them in childhood, but old in cultivation.\r\n\r\n    \"Give me the good old weekday blossoms\r\n       I used to see so long ago,\r\n     With hearty sweetness in their bosoms,\r\n       Ready and glad to bud and blow.\"\r\n\r\nEven were they newcomers, we should speedily care for them, they are so\r\nlovable, so winning, so endearing. If I had seen to-day for the first\r\ntime a Fritillaria, a Violet, a Lilac, a Bluebell, or a Rose, I know it\r\nwould be a case of love at first sight. But with intimacy they have\r\ngrown dearer still.\r\n\r\nThe sense of long-continued acquaintance and friendship which we feel\r\nfor many garden flowers extends to a few blossoms of field and forest.\r\nIt is felt to an inexplicable degree by all New Englanders for the\r\nTrailing Arbutus, our Mayflower; and it is this unformulated sentiment\r\nwhich makes us like to go to the same spot year after year to gather\r\nthese beloved flowers. I am sensible of this friendship for Buttercups,\r\nthey seem the same flowers I knew last year; and I have a distinct\r\nsympathy with Owen Meredith's poem:--\r\n\r\n    \"I pluck the flowers I plucked of old\r\n     About my feet--yet fresh and cold\r\n     The Buttercups do bend;\r\n     The selfsame Buttercups they seem,\r\n     Thick in the bright-eyed green, and such\r\n     As when to me their blissful gleam\r\n     Was all earth's gold--how much!\"\r\n\r\nWe have little of the intense sentiment, the inspiration which filled\r\nflower-lovers of olden times. We admire flowers certainly as beautiful\r\nworks of nature, as objects of wonder in mechanism and in the profusion\r\nof growth, and we are occasionally roused to feelings of gratitude to\r\nthe Maker and Giver of such beauty; but it is not precisely the same\r\nregard that the old gardeners and \"flowerists\" had, which is expressed\r\nin this quotation from Gerarde of \"the gallant grace of violets\":--\r\n\r\n     \"They admonish and stir up a man to that which is comelie and\r\n     honest; for flowers through their beautie, varietie of colour and\r\n     exquisite forme doe bring to a liberall and gentlemanly mind, the\r\n     remembrance of honestie, comelinesse and all kinds of virtues.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a virtue to be comely in those days; as it is indeed a virtue\r\nnow; and to the pious old herbalists it seemed an impossible thing that\r\nany creation which was beautiful should not also be good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Meadow Rue.]\r\n\r\nAll flowers cannot be loved with equal warmth; it is possible to have a\r\nwholesome liking for a flower, a wish to see it around you, which would\r\nmake you plant it in your borders and treat it well, but which would not\r\nbe at all akin to love. For others you have a placid tolerance; others\r\nyou esteem--good, virtuous, worthy creatures, but you cannot warm toward\r\nthem. Sometimes they have been sung with passion by poets (Swinburne is\r\nalways glowing over very unresponsive flower souls) and they have been\r\npainted with fervor by artists--and still you do not love them. I do not\r\nlove Tulips, but I welcome them very cordially in my garden. Others have\r\nloved them; the Tulip has had her head turned by attention.\r\n\r\nSome flowers we like at first sight, but they do not wear well. This is\r\na hard truth; and I shall not shame the garden-creatures who have done\r\ntheir best to please by betraying them to the world, save in a single\r\ncase to furnish an example. In late August the Bergamot blossoms in\r\nluxuriant heads of white and purplish pink bloom, similar in tint to the\r\nabundant Phlox. Both grow freely in the garden of Sylvester Manor. When\r\nthe Bergamot has romped in your borders for two or three years, you may\r\nwish to exile it to a vegetable garden, near the blackberry vines. Is\r\nthis because it is an herb instead of a purely decorative flower? You\r\nnever thus thrust out Phlox. A friend confesses to me that she exiled\r\neven the splendid scarlet Bergamot after she had grown it for three\r\nyears in her flower-beds; such subtle influences control our\r\nflower-loves.\r\n\r\nBeautiful and noble as are the grand contributions of the nineteenth\r\ncentury to us from the garden and fields of Japan and China, we seldom\r\nspeak of loving them. Thus the Chinese White Wistaria is similar in\r\nshape of blossom to the Scotch Laburnum, though a far more elegant, more\r\nlavish flower; but the Laburnum is the loved one. I used to read\r\nlongingly of the Laburnum in volumes of English poetry, especially in\r\nHood's verses, beginning:--\r\n\r\n    \"I remember, I remember,\r\n     The house where I was born,\"\r\n\r\nElla Partridge had a tall Laburnum tree at her front door; it peeped in\r\nthe second-story windows. It was so cherished, that I doubt whether its\r\nblooms were ever gathered. She told us with conscious pride and\r\nrectitude that it was a \"yellow Wistaria tree which came from China\"; I\r\nsaw no reason to doubt her words, and as I never chanced to speak to my\r\nparents about it, I ever thought of it as a yellow Wistaria tree until I\r\nwent out into the world and found it was a Scotch Laburnum.\r\n\r\nFew garden owners plant now the Snowberry, _Symphoricarpus racemosus_,\r\nonce seen in every front yard, and even used for hedges. It wasn't a\r\nvery satisfactory shrub in its habit; the oval leaves were not a\r\ncheerful green, and were usually pallid with mildew. The flowers were\r\ninsignificant, but the clusters of berries were as pure as pearls. In\r\ncountry homes, before the days of cheap winter flowers and omnipresent\r\ngreenhouses, these snowy clusters were cherished to gather in winter to\r\nplace on coffins and in hands as white and cold as the berries. Its\r\nspecial offence in our garden was partly on account of this funereal\r\nassociation, but chiefly because we were never permitted to gather its\r\nberries to string into necklaces. They were rigidly preserved on the\r\nstem as a garden decoration in winter; though they were too closely akin\r\nin color to the encircling snowdrifts to be of any value.\r\n\r\nIn country homes in olden times were found several universal winter\r\nposies. On the narrow mantel shelves of farm and village parlors, both\r\nin England and America, still is seen a winter posy made of dried stalks\r\nof the seed valves of a certain flower; they are shown on the opposite\r\npage. Let us see how our old friend, Gerarde, describes this plant:--\r\n\r\n     \"The stalkes are loden with many flowers like the\r\n     stocke-gilliflower, of a purple colour, which, being fallen, the\r\n     seede cometh foorthe conteined in a flat thinne cod, with a sharp\r\n     point or pricke at one end, in fashion of the moone, and somewhat\r\n     blackish. This cod is composed of three filmes or skins whereof the\r\n     two outermost are of an overworne ashe colour, and the innermost,\r\n     or that in the middle whereon the seed doth hang or cleave, is thin\r\n     and cleere shining, like a piece of white satten newly cut from the\r\n     peece.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter clause of this striking description is given the reason\r\nfor the popular name of the flower, Satin-flower or White Satin, for the\r\ninner septum is a shining membrane resembling white satin. Another\r\ninteresting name is Pricksong-flower. All who have seen sheets of music\r\nof Elizabethan days, when the notes of music were called pricks, and the\r\nwhole sheet a pricksong, will readily trace the resemblance to the seeds\r\nof this plant.\r\n\r\nGerarde says it was named \"Penny-floure, Money-floure, Silver-plate,\r\nSattin, and among our women called Honestie.\" The last name was commonly\r\napplied at the close of the eighteenth century. It is thus named in\r\nwritings of Rev. William Hanbury, 1771, and a Boston seedsman then\r\nadvertised seeds of Honestie \"in small quantities, that all might have\r\nsome.\" In 1665, Josselyn found White Satin planted and growing\r\nplentifully in New England gardens, where I am sure it formed, in garden\r\nand house, a happy reminder of their English homes to the wives of the\r\ncolonists. Since that time it has spread so freely in some localities,\r\nespecially in southern Connecticut, that it grows wild by the wayside.\r\nIt is seldom seen now in well-kept gardens, though it should be, for it\r\nis really a lovely flower, showing from white to varied and rich light\r\npurples. I was charmed with its fresh beauty this spring in the garden\r\nof Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright; a photograph of one of her borders\r\ncontaining Honesty is shown opposite page 174.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Money-in-both-pockets.]\r\n\r\nAt Belvoir Castle in England, in the \"Duchess's Garden,\" the\r\nSatin-flower can be seen in full variety of tint, and fills an important\r\nplace. It is carefully cultivated by seed and division, all inferior\r\nplants being promptly destroyed, while the superior blossoms are\r\ncherished.\r\n\r\nThe flower was much used in charms and spells, as was everything\r\nconnected with the moon. Drayton's Clarinax sings of Lunaria:--\r\n\r\n    \"Enchanting lunarie here lies\r\n     In sorceries excelling.\"\r\n\r\nAs a child this Lunaria was a favorite flower, for it afforded to us\r\njuvenile money. Indeed, it was generally known among us as Money-flower\r\nor Money-seed, or sometimes as Money-in-both-pockets. The seed valves\r\nformed our medium of exchange and trade, passing as silver dollars.\r\n\r\nThrough the streets of a New England village there strolled, harmless\r\nand happy, one who was known in village parlance as a \"softy,\" one of\r\n\"God's fools,\" a poor addle-pated, simple-minded creature, witless--but\r\nneither homeless nor friendless; for children cared for him, and\r\nfeeble-minded though he was, he managed to earn, by rush-seating chairs\r\nand weaving coarse baskets, and gathering berries, scant pennies enough\r\nto keep him alive; and he slept in a deserted barn, in a field full of\r\nrocks and Daisies and Blueberry bushes,--a barn which had been built by\r\none but little more gifted with wits than himself. Poor Elmer never was\r\nable to understand that the money which he and the children saved so\r\ncarefully each autumn from the money plants was not equal in value to\r\nthe great copper cents of the village store; and when he asked gleefully\r\nfor a loaf of bread or a quart of molasses, was just as apt to offer the\r\nshining seed valves in payment as he was to give the coin of the land;\r\nand it must be added that his belief received apparent confirmation in\r\nthe fact that he usually got the bread whether he gave seeds or cents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box Walk in Garden of Frederick J. Kingsbury, Esq.\r\nWaterbury, Connecticut.]\r\n\r\nHe lost his life through his poor simple notion. In the village he was\r\nkindly treated by all, clothed, fed, and warmed; but one day there came\r\nskulking along the edge of the village what were then rare visitors, two\r\ntramps, who by ill-chance met poor Elmer as he was gathering chestnuts.\r\nAnd as the children lingered on their way home from school to take toll\r\nof Elmer's store of nuts, they heard him boasting gleefully of his\r\nwealth, \"hundreds and hundreds of dollars all safe for winter.\" The\r\nchildren knew what his dollars were, but the tramps did not. Three days\r\nof heavy rain passed by, and Elmer did not appear at the store or any\r\nhouse. Then kindly neighbors went to his barn in the distant field, and\r\nfound him cruelly beaten, with broken ribs and in a high fever, while\r\nscattered around him were hundreds of the seeds of his autumnal store of\r\nthe money plant; these were all the silver dollars his assailants found.\r\nHe was carried to the almshouse and died in a few weeks, partly from the\r\nbeating, partly from exposure, but chiefly, I ever believed, from\r\nhomesickness in his enforced home. His old house has fallen down, but\r\nhis well still is open, and around it grows a vast expanse of Lunaria,\r\nwhich has spread and grown from the seeds poor Elmer saved, and every\r\nyear shoots of the tender lilac blooms mingle so charmingly with the\r\nwhite Daisies that the sterile field is one of the show-places of the\r\nvillage, and people drive from afar to see it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lunaria in Garden at Waldstein.]\r\n\r\nThere grow in profusion in our home garden what I always called the\r\nMullein Pink, the Rose Campion (_Lychnis coronaria_). I never heard any\r\none speak of this plant with special affection or admiration; but as\r\na child I loved its crimson flower more than any other flower in the\r\ngarden. Perhaps I should say I loved the royal color rather than the\r\nflower. I gathered tight bunches without foliage into a glowing mass of\r\ncolor unequalled in richness of tint by anything in nature. I have seen\r\nonly in a stained glass window flooded with high sunlight a crimson\r\napproaching that of the Mullein Pink. Gerarde calls the flower the\r\n\"Gardener's Delight or Gardner's Eie.\" It was known in French as the Eye\r\nof God; and the Rose of Heaven. We used to rub our cheeks with the\r\nwoolly leaves to give a beautiful rosy blush, and thereby I once skinned\r\none cheek.\r\n\r\nSnapdragons were a beloved flower--companions of my childhood in our\r\nhome garden, but they have been neglected a bit by nearly every one of\r\nlate years. Plant a clump of the clear yellow and one of pure white\r\nSnapdragons, and see how beautiful they are in the garden, and how fresh\r\nthey keep when cut. We had such a satisfying bunch of them on the dinner\r\ntable to-day, in a milk-white glazed Chinese jar; yellow Snapdragons,\r\nwith \"borrowed leaves\" of Virgin's-bower (_Adlumia_) and a haze of\r\nGypsophila over all.\r\n\r\nA flower much admired in gardens during the early years of the\r\nnineteenth century was the Plume Poppy (_Bocconia_). It has a pretty\r\npinkish bloom in general shape somewhat like Meadow Rue (see page 164\r\nand page 167). A friend fancied a light feathery look over certain of\r\nher garden borders, and she planted plentifully Plume Poppy and Meadow\r\nRue; this was in 1895. In 1896 the effect was exquisite; in 1897 the\r\ngarden feathered out with far too much fulness; in 1901 all the combined\r\nforces of all the weeds of the garden could not equal these two flowers\r\nin utter usurpment and close occupation of every inch of that garden.\r\nThe Plume Poppy has a strong tap-root which would be a good symbol of\r\nthe root of the tree Ygdrassyl--the Tree of Life, that never dies. You\r\ncan go over the borders with scythe and spade and hoe, and even with\r\nmanicure-scissors, but roots of the Plume Poppy will still hide and send\r\nup vigorous growth the succeeding year.\r\n\r\nWe have grown so familiar with some old doubled blossoms that we think\r\nlittle of their being double. One such, symmetrical of growth, beautiful\r\nof foliage, and gratifying of bloom, is the Double Buttercup. It is to\r\nme distinctly one of our most old-fashioned flowers in aspect. A hardy\r\ngreat clump of many years' growth is one of the ancient treasures of our\r\ngarden; its golden globes are known in England as Bachelor's Buttons,\r\nand are believed by many to be the Bachelor's Buttons of Shakespeare's\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dahlia Walk at Ravensworth.]\r\n\r\nDahlias afford a striking example of the beauty of single flowers when\r\ncompared to their doubled descendants. Single Dahlias are fine flowers,\r\nthe yellow and scarlet ones especially so. I never thought double\r\nDahlias really worth the trouble spent on them in our Northern gardens;\r\nso much staking and tying, and fussing, and usually an autumn storm\r\nwrenches them round and breaks the stem or a frost nips them just as\r\nthey are in bloom. A Dahlia hedge or a walk such as this one at\r\nRavensworth, Virginia, is most stately and satisfying. I like, in\r\nmoderation, many of the smaller single and double Sunflowers. Under the\r\nreign of _Patience_, the Sunflower had a fleeting day of popularity, and\r\nflaunted in garden and parlor. Its place was false. It was never a\r\ngarden flower in olden times, in the sense of being a flower of ornament\r\nor beauty; its place was in the kitchen garden, where it belongs.\r\n\r\nPeas have ever been favorites in English gardens since they were brought\r\nto England. We have all seen the print, if not the portrait, of Queen\r\nElizabeth garbed in a white satin robe magnificently embroidered with\r\nopen pea-pods and butterflies. A \"City of London Madam\" had a delightful\r\nhead ornament of open pea-pods filled with peas of pearls; this was worn\r\nover a hood of gold-embroidered muslin, and with dyed red hair, must\r\nhave been a most modish affair. Sweet Peas have had a unique history.\r\nThey have been for a century a much-loved flower of the people both in\r\nEngland and America, and they were at home in cottage borders and fine\r\ngardens; were placed in vases, and carried in nosegays and posies; were\r\nloved of poets--Keats wrote an exquisite characterization of them. They\r\nhad beauty of color, and a universally loved perfume--but florists have\r\nbeen blind to them till within a few years. A bicentenary exhibition of\r\nSweet Peas was given in London in July, 1900; now there is formed a\r\nSweet Pea Society. But no societies and no exhibitions ever will make\r\nthem a \"florist's flower\"; they are of value only for cutting; their\r\nhabit of growth renders them useless as a garden decoration.\r\n\r\nWe all take notions in regard to flowers, just as we do in regard to\r\npeople. I hear one friend say, \"I love every flower that grows,\" but I\r\nanswer with emphasis, \"I don't!\" I have ever disliked the Portulaca,--I\r\nhate its stems. It is my fate never to escape it. I planted it once to\r\ngrow under Sweet Alyssum in the little enclosure of earth behind my city\r\nhome; when I returned in the autumn, everything was covered, blanketed,\r\noverwhelmed with Portulaca. Since then it comes up even in the grass,\r\nand seems to thrive by being trampled upon. The Portulaca was not a\r\nflower of colonial days; I am glad to learn our great-grandmothers were\r\nnot pestered with it; it was not described in the _Botanical Magazine_\r\ntill 1829.\r\n\r\nI do not care for the Petunia close at hand on account of its sickish\r\nodor. But in the dusky border the flowers shine like white stars (page\r\n180), and make you almost forgive their poor colors in the daylight. I\r\nnever liked the Calceolaria. Every child in our town used to have a\r\nCalceolaria in her own small garden plot, but I never wanted one. I care\r\nlittle for Chrysanthemums; they fill in the border in autumn, and they\r\nlook pretty well growing, but I like few of the flowers close at hand.\r\nBy some curious twist of a brain which, alas! is apt not to deal as it\r\nis expected and ought to, with sensations furnished to it, I have felt\r\nthis distaste for Chrysanthemums since I attended a Chrysanthemum Show.\r\nOf course, I ought to love them far more, and have more eager interest\r\nin them--but I do not. Their sister, the China Aster, I care little for.\r\nThe Germans call Asters \"death-flowers.\" The Empress of Austria at the\r\nSwiss hotel where she lodged just before she was murdered, found the\r\nrooms decorated with China Asters. She said to her attendant that the\r\nflowers were in Austria termed death-flowers--and so they proved. The\r\nAster is among the flowers prohibited in Japan for felicitous occasions,\r\nas are the Balsam, Rhododendron, and Azalea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Petunias.]\r\n\r\nThose who read these pages may note perhaps that I say little of Lilies.\r\nI do not care as much for them as most garden lovers do. I like all our\r\nwild Lilies, especially the yellow Nodding Lily of our fields; and the\r\nLemon Lily of our gardens is ever a delight; but the stately Lilies\r\nwhich are such general favorites, Madonna Lilies, Japan Lilies, the\r\nGold-banded Lilies, are not especially dear to me.\r\n\r\nI love climbing vines, whether of delicate leaf or beautiful flower. In\r\na room I place all the decoration that I can on the walls, out of the\r\nway, leaving thus space to move around without fear of displacement or\r\ninjury of fragile things; so in a limited garden space, grass room under\r\nour feet, with flowering vines on the surrounding walls are better than\r\nmany crowded flower borders. A tiny space can quickly be made delightful\r\nwith climbing plants. The common Morning-glory, called in England the\r\nBell-bind, is frequently advertised by florists of more encouragement\r\nthan judgment, as suitable to plant freely in order to cover fences and\r\npoor sandy patches of ground with speedy and abundant leafage and bloom.\r\nThere is no doubt that the Morning-glory will do all this and far more\r\nthan is promised. It will also spread above and below ground from the\r\npoor strip of earth to every other corner of garden and farm. This it\r\nhas done till, in our Eastern states, it is now classed as a wild\r\nflower. It will never look wild, however, meet it where you will. It is\r\nas domestic and tame as a barnyard fowl, which, wandering in the wildest\r\nwoodland, could never be mistaken as game. The garden at Claymont, the\r\nVirginia home of Mr. Frank R. Stockton, afforded a striking example of\r\nthe spreading and strangling properties of the Morning-glory, not under\r\nencouragement, but simply under toleration. Mr. Stockton tells me that\r\nthe entire expanse of his yards and garden, when he first saw them, was\r\na solid mass of Morning-glory blooms. Every stick, every stem, every\r\nstalk, every shrub and blade of grass, every vegetable growth, whether\r\ndead or alive, had its encircling and overwhelming Morning-glory\r\ncompanion, set full of tiny undersized blossoms of varied tints. It was\r\na beautiful sight at break of day,--a vast expanse of acres jewelled\r\nwith Morning-glories--but it wasn't the new owner's notion of a flower\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nIn my childhood flower agents used to canvass country towns from house\r\nto house. Sometimes they had a general catalogue, and sold many plants,\r\ntrees, and shrubs. Oftener they had but a single plant which they were\r\n\"booming.\" I suspect that their trade came through the sudden\r\nintroduction of so many and varied flowers and shrubs from China and\r\nJapan. I am told that the first Chinese Wistarias and a certain Fringe\r\ntree were sold in this manner; and I know the white Hydrangea was, for I\r\nrecall it, though I do not know that this was its first sale. I remember\r\ntoo that suddenly half the houses in town, on piazza or trellis, had the\r\nrich purple blooms of the _Clematis Jackmanni_; for a very persuasive\r\nagent had gone through the town the previous year. Of course people of\r\nmeans bought then, as now, at nurseries; but at many humble homes, whose\r\nowners would never have thought of buying from a greenhouse, he sold his\r\nplants. It gave an agreeable rivalry, when all started plants together,\r\nto see whose flourished best and had the amplest bloom. Thoreau recalled\r\nthe pleasant emulation of many owners in Concord of a certain\r\nRhododendron, sold thus sweepingly by an agent. The purple Clematis\r\ndisplaced an old climbing favorite, the Trumpet Honeysuckle, once seen\r\nby every door. It was so beloved of humming-birds and so beautiful, I\r\nwonder we could ever destroy it. Its downfall was hastened by its being\r\ninfested by a myriad of tiny green aphides, which proceeded from it to\r\nour Roses. I recall well these little plant insects, for I was very fond\r\nof picking the tubes of the Honeysuckle for the drop of pure honey\r\nwithin, and I had to abandon reluctantly the sweet morsels.\r\n\r\nWe have in our garden, and it is shown on the succeeding page, a vine\r\nwhich we carefully cherished in seedlings from year to year, and took\r\nmuch pride in. It came to us with the Ambrosia from the Walpole garden.\r\nIt was not common in gardens in our neighborhood, and I always looked\r\nupon it as something very choice, and even rare, as it certainly was\r\nsomething very dainty and pretty. We called it Virgin's-bower. When I\r\nwent out into the world I found that it was not rare, that it grew wild\r\nfrom Connecticut to the far West; that it was Climbing Fumitory, or\r\nMountain Fringe, _Adlumia_. When Mrs. Margaret Deland asked if we had\r\nAlleghany Vine in our garden, I told her I had never seen it, when all\r\nthe while it was our own dear Virgin's-bower. It doesn't seem hardy\r\nenough to be a wild thing; how could it make its way against the fierce\r\nvines and thorns of the forest when it hasn't a bit of woodiness in its\r\nstems and its leaves and flowers are so tender! I cannot think any\r\ngarden perfect without it, no matter what else is there, for its\r\ndelicate green Rue-like leaves lie so gracefully on stone or brick\r\nwalls, or on fences, and it trails its slender tendrils so lightly over\r\ndull shrubs that are out of flower, beautifying them afresh with an\r\nalien bloom of delicate little pinkish blossoms like tiny\r\nBleeding-hearts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Virgin's-bower.]\r\n\r\nAnother old favorite was the Balloon-vine, sometimes called Heartseed\r\nor Heart-pea, with its seeds like fat black hearts, with three lobes\r\nwhich made them globose instead of flat. This, too, had pretty compound\r\nleaves, and the whole vine, like our Virgin's-bower, lay lightly on what\r\nit covered; but the Dutchman's-pipe had a leafage too heavy save to make\r\na thick screen or arch quickly and solidly. It did well enough in\r\ngardens which had not had a long cultivated past, or made little\r\npreparation for a cherished future; but it certainly was not suited to\r\nour garden, where things were not planted for a day. These three are\r\nnative vines of rich woods in our Central and Western states. The\r\nMatrimony-vine was an old favorite; one from the porch of the Van\r\nCortlandt manor-house, over a hundred years old, is shown on the next\r\npage. Often you see a straggling, sprawling growth; but this one is as\r\nfine as any vine could be.\r\n\r\nPatient folk--as were certainly those of the old-time gardens, tried to\r\nkeep the Rose Acacia as a favorite. It was hardy enough, but so\r\nhopelessly brittle in wood that it was constantly broken by the wind and\r\nsnow of our Northern winters, even though it was sheltered under some\r\nstronger shrub. At the end of a lovely Salem garden, I beheld this June\r\na long row of Rose Acacias in full bloom. I am glad I possess in my\r\nmemory the exquisite harmony of their shimmering green foliage and rosy\r\nflower clusters. Miss Jekyll, ever resourceful, trains the Rose Acacia\r\non a wall; and fastens it down by planting sturdy Crimson Ramblers by\r\nits side; her skilful example may well be followed in America and thus\r\nrestore to our gardens this beautiful flower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Matrimony-vine at Van Cortlandt Manor.]\r\n\r\nOne flower, termed old-fashioned by nearly every one, is really a recent\r\nsettler of our gardens. A popular historical novel of American life at\r\nthe time of the Revolution makes the hero and heroine play a very pretty\r\nlove scene over a spray of the Bleeding-heart, the Dielytra, or\r\nDicentra. Unfortunately for the truth of the novelist's picture, the\r\nDielytra was not introduced to the gardens of English-speaking folk\r\ntill 1846, when the London Horticultural Society received a single plant\r\nfrom the north of China. How quickly it became cheap and abundant; soon\r\nit bloomed in every cottage garden; how quickly it became beloved! The\r\ngraceful racemes of pendant rosy flowers were eagerly welcomed by\r\nchildren; they have some inexplicable, witching charm; even young\r\nchildren in arms will stretch out their little hands and attempt to\r\ngrasp the Dielytra, when showier blossoms are passed unheeded. Many tiny\r\nplaythings can be formed of the blossoms: only deft fingers can shape\r\nthe delicate lyre in the \"frame.\" One of its folk names is \"Lyre\r\nflower\"; the two wings can be bent back to form a gondola.\r\n\r\nWe speak of modern flowers, meaning those which have recently found\r\ntheir way to our gardens. Some of these clash with the older occupants,\r\nbut one has promptly been given an honored place, and appears so allied\r\nto the older flowers in form and spirit that it seems to belong by their\r\nside--the _Anemone Japonica_. Its purity and beauty make it one of the\r\ndelights of the autumn garden; our grandmothers would have rejoiced in\r\nit, and have divided the plants with each other till all had a row of it\r\nin the garden borders. In its red form it was first pictured in the\r\n_Botanical Magazine_, in 1847, but it has been commonly seen in our\r\ngardens for only twenty or thirty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White Wistaria.]\r\n\r\nThese two flowers, the _Dielytra spectabilis_ and _Anemone Japonica_,\r\nare among the valuable gifts which our gardens received through the\r\nvisits to China of that adventurous collector, Robert Fortune. He went\r\nthere first in 1842, and for some years constantly sent home fresh\r\ntreasures. Among the best-known garden flowers of his introducing are\r\nthe two named above, and _Kerria Japonica_, _Forsythia viridissima_,\r\n_Weigela rosea_, _Gardenia Fortuniana_, _Daphne Fortunei_, _Berberis\r\nFortunei_, _Jasminum nudiflorum_, and many varieties of Prunus,\r\nViburnum, Spiraea, Azalea, and Chrysanthemum. The fine yellow Rose known\r\nas Fortune's Yellow was acquired by him during a venturesome trip which\r\nhe took, disguised as a Chinaman. The white Chinese Wistaria is regarded\r\nas the most important of his collections. It is deemed by some\r\nflower-lovers the most exquisite flower in the entire world. The Chinese\r\nvariety is distinguished by the length of its racemes, sometimes three\r\nfeet long. The lower part of a vine of unusual luxuriance and beauty is\r\nshown above. This special vine flowers in full richness of bloom every\r\nalternate year, and this photograph was taken during its \"poor year\";\r\nfor in its finest inflorescence its photograph would show simply a mass\r\nof indistinguishable whiteness. Mr. Howell has named it The Fountain,\r\nand above the pouring of white blossoms shown in this picture is an\r\nupper cascade of bloom. This Wistaria is not growing in an\r\nover-favorable locality, for winter winds are bleak on the southern\r\nshores of Long Island; but I know no rival of its beauty in far warmer\r\nand more sheltered sites.\r\n\r\nMany of the Deutzias and Spiraeas which beautify our spring gardens were\r\nintroduced from Japan before Fortune's day by Thunberg, the great\r\nexploiter of Japanese shrubs, who died in 1828. The Spiraea Van Houtteii\r\n(facing page 190) is perhaps the most beautiful of all. Dean Hole names\r\nthe Spiraeas, Deutzias, Weigelas, and Forsythias as having been brought\r\ninto his ken in English gardens within his own lifetime, that is within\r\nfourscore years.\r\n\r\nIn New England gardens the Forsythia is called 'Sunshine Bush'--and\r\nnever was folk name better bestowed, or rather evolved. For in the eager\r\nlonging for spring which comes in the bitterness of March, when we cry\r\nout with the poet, \"O God, for one clear day, a Snowdrop and sweet air,\"\r\nin our welcome to fresh life, whether shown in starting leaf or frail\r\nblossom, the Forsythia shines out a grateful delight to the eyes and\r\nheart, concentrating for a week all the golden radiance of sunlight,\r\nwhich later will be shared by sister shrubs and flowers. _Forsythia\r\nsuspensa_, falling in long sweeps of yellow bells, is in some favorable\r\nplaces a cascade of liquid light. No shrub in our gardens is more\r\nfrequently ruined by gardeners than these Forsythias. It takes an\r\nartist to prune the _Forsythia suspensa_. You can steal the sunshine for\r\nyour homes ere winter is gone by breaking long sprays of the Sunshine\r\nBush and placing them in tall deep jars of water. Split up the ends of\r\nthe stems that they may absorb plentiful water, and the golden plumes\r\nwill soon open to fullest glory within doors.\r\n\r\nThere is another yellow flowered shrub, the Corchorus, which seems as\r\nold as the Lilac, for it is ever found in old gardens; but it proves to\r\nbe a Japanese shrub which we have had only a hundred years. The little,\r\ndeep yellow, globular blossoms appear in early spring and sparsely\r\nthroughout the whole summer. The plant isn't very adorning in its usual\r\nragged growth, but it was universally planted.\r\n\r\nIt may be seen from the shrubs of popular growth which I have named that\r\nthe present glory of our shrubberies is from the Japanese and Chinese\r\nshrubs, which came to us in the nineteenth century through Thunberg,\r\nFortune, and other bold collectors. We had no shrub-sellers of\r\nimportance in the eighteenth century; the garden lover turned wholly to\r\nthe seedsman and bulb-grower for garden supplies, just as we do to-day\r\nto fill our old-fashioned gardens. The new shrubs and plants from China\r\nand Japan did not clash with the old garden flowers, they seemed like\r\nkinsfolk who had long been separated and rejoiced in being reunited;\r\nthey were indeed fellow-countrymen. We owed scores of our older flowers\r\nto the Orient, among them such important ones as the Lilac, Rose, Lily,\r\nTulip, Crown Imperial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spiraea Van Houtteii.]\r\n\r\nWe can fancy how delighted all these Oriental shrubs and flowers were to\r\nmeet after so many years of separation. What pleasant greetings all the\r\ncousins must have given each other; I am sure the Wistaria was glad to\r\nsee the Lilac, and the Fortune's Yellow Rose was duly respectful to his\r\nold cousin, the thorny yellow Scotch Rose. And I seem to hear a bit of\r\nscandal passing from plant to plant! Listen! it is the Bleeding-heart\r\ngossiping with the Japanese Anemone: \"Well! I never thought that Lilac\r\ngirl would grow to be such a beauty. So much color! Do you suppose it\r\ncan be natural? Mrs. Tulip hinted to me yesterday that the girl used\r\nfertilizers, and it certainly looks so. But she can't say much\r\nherself--I never saw such a change in any creatures as in those Tulips.\r\nYou remember how commonplace their clothes were? Now such extravagance!\r\nScores of gowns, and all made abroad, and at _her_ age! Here are you and\r\nI, my dear, both young, and we really ought to have more clothes. I\r\nhaven't a thing but this pink gown to put on. It's lucky you had a white\r\ngown, for no one liked your pink one. Here comes Mrs. Rose! How those\r\nRose children have grown! I never should have known them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCOMFORT ME WITH APPLES\r\n\r\n     \"What can your eye desire to see, your eares to heare, your mouth\r\n     to taste, or your nose to smell, that is not to be had in an\r\n     Orchard? with Abundance and Variety? What shall I say? 1000 of\r\n     Delights are in an Orchard; and sooner shall I be weary than I can\r\n     reckon the least part of that pleasure which one, that hath and\r\n     loves an Orchard, may find therein.\"\r\n\r\n     --_A New Orchard_, WILLIAM LAWSON, 1618.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn every old-time garden, save the revered front yard, the borders\r\nstretched into the domain of the Currant and Gooseberry bushes, and into\r\nthe orchard. Often a row of Crabapple trees pressed up into the garden's\r\nprecincts and shaded the Sweet Peas. Orchard and garden could scarcely\r\nbe separated, so closely did they grow up together. Every old garden\r\nbook had long chapters on orchards, written _con amore_, with a zest\r\nsometimes lacking on other pages. How they loved in the days of Queen\r\nElizabeth and of Queen Anne to sit in an orchard, planted, as Sir Philip\r\nSidney said, \"cunningly with trees of taste-pleasing fruits.\" How\r\ncharming were their orchard seats, \"fachoned for meditacon!\" Sometimes\r\nthese orchard seats were banks of the strongly scented Camomile, a\r\nfavorite plant of Lord Bacon's day. Wordsworth wrote in jingling\r\nrhyme:--\r\n\r\n    \"Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed\r\n     Their snow-white blossoms on my head,\r\n     With brightest sunshine round me spread\r\n       Of spring's unclouded weather,\r\n     In this sequester'd nook how sweet\r\n     To sit upon my orchard seat;\r\n     And flowers and birds once more to greet,\r\n       My last year's friends together.\"\r\n\r\nThe incomparable beauty of the Apple tree in full bloom has ever been\r\nsung by the poets, but even their words cannot fitly nor fully tell the\r\ndelight to the senses of the close view of those exquisite pink and\r\nwhite domes, with their lovely opalescent tints, their ethereal\r\nfragrance; their beauty infinitely surpasses that of the vaunted Cherry\r\nplantations of Japan. In the hand the flowers show a distinct ruddiness,\r\na promise of future red cheeks; but a long vista of trees in bloom\r\ndisplays no tint of pink, the flowers seem purest white. Looking last\r\nMay across the orchard at Hillside, adown the valley of the Hudson with\r\nits succession of blossoming orchards, we could paraphrase the words of\r\nLongfellow's _Golden Legend_:--\r\n\r\n                                    \"The valley stretching below\r\n    Is white with blossoming Apple trees, as if touched with lightest\r\n      snow.\"\r\n\r\nIn the darkest night flowering Apple trees shine with clear radiance,\r\nand an orchard of eight hundred acres, such as may be seen in Niagara\r\nCounty, New York, shows a white expanse like a lake of quicksilver.\r\nThis county, and its neighbor, Orleans County, form an Apple\r\nparadise--with their orchards of fifty and even a hundred thousand\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apple Trees at White Hall, the Home of Bishop Berkeley.]\r\n\r\nThe largest Apple tree in New England is in Cheshire, Connecticut. Its\r\ntrunk measures, one foot above all root enlargements, thirteen feet\r\neight inches in circumference.\r\n\r\nIts age is traced back a hundred and fifty years. At White Hall, the\r\nold home of Bishop Berkeley in the island of Rhode Island, still stand\r\nthe Apple trees of his day. A picture of them is shown on page 194.\r\n\r\nThe sedate and comfortable motherliness of old Apple trees is felt by\r\nall Apple lovers. John Burroughs speaks of \"maternal old Apple trees,\r\nregular old grandmothers, who have seen trouble.\" James Lane Allen, amid\r\nhis apostrophes to the Hemp plant, has given us some beautiful glimpses\r\nof Apple trees and his love for them. He tells of \"provident old tree\r\nmothers on the orchard slope, whose red-cheeked children are autumn\r\nApples.\" It is this motherliness, this domesticity, this homeliness that\r\nmakes the Apple tree so cherished, so beloved. No scene of life in the\r\ncountry ever seems to me homelike if it lacks an Apple orchard--this\r\ndoubtless, because in my birthplace in New England they form a part of\r\nevery farm scene, of every country home. Apple trees soften and humanize\r\nthe wildest country scene. Even in a remote pasture, or on a mountain\r\nside, they convey a sentiment of home; and after being lost in the mazes\r\nof close-grown wood-roads Apple trees are inexpressibly welcome as\r\ngiving promise of a sheltering roof-tree. Thoreau wrote of wild Apples,\r\nbut to me no Apples ever look wild. They may be the veriest Crabs,\r\ngrowing in wild spots, unbidden, and savage and bitter in their tang,\r\nbut even these seedling Pippins are domestic in aspect.\r\n\r\nOn the southern shores of Long Island, where meadow, pasture, and farm\r\nare in soil and crops like New England, the frequent absence of Apple\r\norchards makes these farm scenes unsatisfying, not homelike. No other\r\nfruit trees can take their place. An Orange tree, with its rich glossy\r\nfoliage, its perfumed ivory flowers and buds, and abundant golden fruit,\r\nis an exquisite creation of nature; but an Orange grove has no ideality.\r\nAll fruit trees have a beautiful inflorescence--few have sentiment. The\r\ntint of a blossoming Peach tree is perfect; but I care not for a Peach\r\norchard. Plantations of healthy Cherry trees are lovely in flower and\r\nfruit time, whether in Japan or Massachusetts, and a Cherry tree is full\r\nof happy child memories; but their tree forms in America are often\r\ndisfigured with that ugly fungous blight which is all the more\r\ndisagreeable to us since we hear now of its close kinship to disease\r\ngerms in the animal world.\r\n\r\nI cannot see how they avoid having Apple trees on these Long Island\r\nfarms, for the Apple is fully determined to stand beside every home and\r\nin every garden in the land. It does not have to be invited; it will\r\nplant and maintain itself. Nearly all fruits and vegetables which we\r\nprize, depend on our planting and care, but the Apple is as independent\r\nas the New England farmer. In truth Apple trees would grow on these\r\nfarms if they were loved or even tolerated, for I find them forced into\r\nLong Island hedge-rows as relentlessly as are forest trees.\r\n\r\nThe Indians called the Plantain the \"white man's foot,\" for it sprung up\r\nwherever he trod; the Apple tree might be called the white man's shadow.\r\nIt is the Vine and Fig tree of the temperate zone, and might be chosen\r\nas the totem of the white settlers. Our love for the Apple is natural,\r\nfor it was the characteristic fruit of Britain; the clergy were its\r\nchief cultivators; they grew Apples in their monastery gardens, prayed\r\nfor them in special religious ceremonies, sheltered the fruit by laws,\r\nand even named the Apple when pronouncing the blessings of God upon\r\ntheir princes and rulers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    \"The valley stretching below\r\n     Is white with blossoming Apple trees, as if touched with lightest\r\n       snow.\"]\r\n\r\nThoreau described an era of luxury as one in which men cultivate the\r\nApple and the amenities of the garden. He thought it indicated relaxed\r\nnerves to read gardening books, and he regarded gardening as a civil and\r\nsocial function, not a love of nature. He tells of his own love for\r\nfreedom and savagery--and he found what he so deemed at Walden Pond. I\r\nam told his haunts are little changed since the years when he lived\r\nthere; and I had expected to find Walden Pond a scene of much wild\r\nbeauty, but it was the mildest of wild woods; it seemed to me as\r\nthoroughly civilized and social as an Apple orchard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Hand-power Cider Mill.]\r\n\r\nThoreau christened the Apple trees of his acquaintance with appropriate\r\nnames in the _lingua vernacula_: the Truant's Apple, the Saunterer's\r\nApple, December Eating, Wine of New England, the Apple of the Dell in\r\nthe Wood, the Apple of the Hollow in the Pasture, the Railroad Apple,\r\nthe Cellar-hole Apple, the Frozen-thawed, and many more; these he loved\r\nfor their fruit; to them let me add the Playhouse Apple trees, loved\r\nsolely for their ingeniously twisted branches, an Apple tree of the\r\ngarden, often overhanging the flower borders. I recall their glorious\r\nwhiteness in the spring, but I cannot remember that they bore any fruit\r\nsave a group of serious little girls. I know there were no Apples on the\r\nPlayhouse Apple trees in my garden, nor on the one in Nelly Gilbert's or\r\nElla Partridge's garden. There is no play place for girls like an old\r\nApple tree. The main limbs leave the trunk at exactly the right height\r\nfor children to reach, and every branch and twig seems to grow and turn\r\nonly to form delightful perches for children to climb among and cling\r\nto. Some Apple trees in our town had a copy of an Elizabethan garden\r\nfurnishing; their branches enclosed tree platforms about twelve feet\r\nfrom the ground, reached by a narrow ladder or flight of steps. These\r\nwere built by generous parents for their children's playhouses, but\r\ntheir approach of ladder was too unhazardous, their railings too\r\nsafety-assuring, to prove anything but conventional and uninteresting.\r\nThe natural Apple tree offered infinite variety, and a slight sense of\r\ndaring to the climber. Its possibility of accident was fulfilled; untold\r\nnumber of broken arms and ribs--juvenile--were resultant from falls from\r\nApple trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pressing out Cider in Old Hand Mill.]\r\n\r\nOne of Thoreau's Apples was the Green Apple (_Malus viridis_, or\r\n_Cholera morbifera puerelis delectissima_). I know not for how many\r\ncenturies boys (and girls too) have eaten and suffered from green\r\napples. A description was written in 1684 which might have happened any\r\nsummer since; I quote it with reminiscent delight, for I have the same\r\nlove for the spirited relation that I had in my early youth when I\r\nnever, for a moment, in spite of the significant names, deemed the\r\nentire book anything but a real story; the notion that _Pilgrim's\r\nProgress_ was an allegory never entered my mind.\r\n\r\n     \"Now there was on the other side of the wall a _Garden_. And some\r\n     of the Fruit-Trees that grew in the Garden shot their Branches over\r\n     the Wall, and being mellow, they that found them did gather them up\r\n     and oft eat of them to their hurt. So _Christiana's_ Boys, _as Boys\r\n     are apt to do_, being _pleas'd_ with the Trees did _Plash_ them and\r\n     began to eat. Their Mother did also chide them for so doing, but\r\n     still the Boys went on. Now _Matthew_ the Eldest Son of\r\n     _Christiana_ fell sick.... There dwelt not far from thence one Mr.\r\n     _Skill_ an Ancient and well approved Physician. So Christiana\r\n     desired it and they sent for him and he came. And when he was\r\n     entered the Room and a little observed the Boy he concluded that he\r\n     was sick of the Gripes. Then he said to his Mother, _What Diet has\r\n     Matthew of late fed upon_? _Diet_, said Christiana, _nothing but\r\n     which is wholesome_. The Physician answered, _This Boy has been\r\n     tampering with something that lies in his Maw undigested_.... Then\r\n     said Samuel, _Mother, Mother, what was that which my brother did\r\n     gather up and eat. You know there was an Orchard and my Brother did\r\n     plash and eat. True, my child_, said Christiana, _naughty boy as he\r\n     was. I did chide him and yet he would eat thereof._\"\r\n\r\nThe realistic treatment of Mr. Skill and Matthew's recovery thereby need\r\nnot be quoted.\r\n\r\nAn historic Apple much esteemed in Connecticut and Rhode Island, and\r\noften planted at the edge of the flower garden, is called the Sapson, or\r\nEarly Sapson, Sapson Sweet, Sapsyvine, and in Pennsylvania, Wine-sap.\r\nThe name is a corruption of the old English Apple name, Sops-o'-wine. It\r\nis a charming little red-cheeked Apple of early autumn, slightly larger\r\nthan a healthy Crab-apple. The clear red of its skin perfuses in\r\ncoral-colored veins and beautiful shadings to its very core. It has a\r\ncondensed, spicy, aromatic flavor, not sharp like a Crab-apple, but it\r\nmakes a better jelly even than the Crab-apple--jelly of a ruby color\r\nwith an almost wine-like flavor, a true Sops-of-wine. This fruit is\r\ndeemed so choice that I have known the sale of a farm to halt for some\r\nweeks until it could be proved that certain Apple trees in the orchard\r\nbore the esteemed Sapsyvines.\r\n\r\nUnder New England and New York farm-houses was a cellar filled with bins\r\nfor vegetables and apples. As the winter passed on there rose from these\r\ncellars a curious, earthy, appley smell, which always seemed most\r\npowerful in the best parlor, the room least used. How Schiller, who\r\nloved the scent of rotten apples, would have rejoiced! The cellar also\r\ncontained many barrels of cider; for the beauty of the Apple trees, and\r\nthe use of their fruit as food, were not the only factors which\r\ninfluenced the planting of the many Apple orchards of the new world;\r\nthey afforded a universal drink--cider. I have written at length, in my\r\nbooks, _Home Life in Colonial Days_ and _Stage-Coach and Tavern Days_,\r\nthe history of the vogue and manufacture of cider in the new world. The\r\ncherished Apple orchards of Endicott, Blackstone, Wolcott, and Winthrop\r\nwere so speedily multiplied that by 1670 cider was plentiful and cheap\r\neverywhere. By the opening of the eighteenth century it had wholly\r\ncrowded out beer and metheglin; and was the drink of old and young on\r\nall occasions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Horse-lever Cider Mill.]\r\n\r\nAt first, cider was made by pounding the Apples by hand in wooden\r\nmortars; then simple mills were formed of a hollowed log and a spring\r\nboard. Rude hand presses, such as are shown on pages 198 and 200, were\r\nknown in 1660, and lingered to our own day. Kalm, the Swedish\r\nnaturalist, saw ancient horse presses (like the one depicted on this\r\npage) in use in the Hudson River Valley in 1749. In autumn the whole\r\ncountry-side was scented with the sour, fruity smell from these cider\r\nmills; and the gift of a draught of sweet cider to any passer-by was as\r\nample and free as of water from the brookside. The cider when barrelled\r\nand stored for winter was equally free to all comers, as well it might\r\nbe, when many families stored a hundred barrels for winter use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Straining off\" the Cider.]\r\n\r\nThe Washingtonian or Temperance reform which swept over this country\r\nlike a purifying wind in the first quarter of the nineteenth century,\r\nfound many temporizers who tried to exclude cider from the list of\r\nintoxicating drinks which converts pledged themselves to abandon. Some\r\nfarmers who adopted this much-needed movement against the\r\nall-prevailing vice of drunkenness received it with fanatic zeal. It\r\nmakes the heart of the Apple lover ache to read that in this spirit they\r\ncut down whole orchards of flourishing Apple trees, since they could\r\nconceive no adequate use for their apples save for cider. That any\r\nshould have tried to exclude cider from the list of intoxicating\r\nbeverages seems barefaced indeed to those who have tasted that most\r\npotent of all spirits--frozen cider. I once drank a small modicum of\r\nJericho cider, as smooth as Benedictine and more persuasive, which made\r\na raw day in April seem like sunny midsummer. I afterward learned from\r\nthe ingenuous Long Island farmer whose hospitality gave me this liqueur\r\nthat it had been frozen seven times. Each time he had thrust a red-hot\r\npoker into the bung-hole of the barrel, melted all the watery ice and\r\npoured it out; therefore the very essence of the cider was all that\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the folk customs of Old England which have\r\nlingered here, such as domestic love divinations. The poet Gay wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"I pare this Pippin round and round again,\r\n     My shepherd's name to flourish on the plain.\r\n     I fling th' unbroken paring o'er my head,\r\n     Upon the grass a perfect L. is read.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen New England schoolgirls, scores of times, thus toss an\r\n\"unbroken paring.\" An ancient trial of my youth was done with Apple\r\nseeds; these were named for various swains, then slightly wetted and\r\nstuck on the cheek or forehead, while we chanted:--\r\n\r\n    \"Pippin! Pippin! Paradise!\r\n     Tell me where my true love lies!\"\r\n\r\nThe seed that remained longest in place indicated the favored and\r\nfavoring lover.\r\n\r\nWith the neglect in this country of Saints' Days and the Puritanical\r\nfrowning down of all folk customs connected with them, we lost the\r\ndelightful wassailing of the Apple trees. This, like many another\r\nreligious observance, was a relic of heathen sacrifice, in this case to\r\nPomona. It was celebrated with slight variations in various parts of\r\nEngland; and was called an Apple howling, a wassailing, a youling, and\r\nother terms. The farmer and his workmen carried to the orchard great\r\njugs of cider or milk pans filled with cider and roasted apples.\r\nEncircling in turn the best bearing trees, they drank from\r\n\"clayen-cups,\" and poured part of the contents on the ground under the\r\ntrees. And while they wassailed the trees they sang:--\r\n\r\n             \"Here's to thee, old Apple tree!\r\n    Whence thou mayst bud, and whence thou mayst blow,\r\n    And whence thou mayst bear Apples enow!\r\n              Hats full! caps full,\r\n              Bushel--Bushel--sacks full,\r\n              And my pockets full too.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Devonshire rhyme ran:--\r\n\r\n    \"Health to thee, good Apple tree!\r\n     Well to bear pocket-fulls, hat-fulls,\r\n     Peck-fulls, bushel bag-fulls.\"\r\n\r\nThe wassailing of the trees gave place in America to a jovial autumnal\r\ngathering known as an Apple cut, an Apple paring, or an Apple bee. The\r\ncheerful kitchen of the farm-house was set out with its entire array of\r\nempty pans, pails, tubs, and baskets. Heaped-up barrels of apples stood\r\nin the centre of the room. The many skilful hands of willing neighbors\r\nemptied the barrels, and with sharp knives or an occasional Apple parer,\r\nfilled the empty vessels with cleanly pared and quartered apples.\r\n\r\nWhen the work was finished, divinations with Apple parings and Apple\r\nseeds were tried, simple country games were played; occasionally there\r\nwas a fiddler and a dance. An autumnal supper was served from the three\r\nzones of the farm-house: nuts from the attic, Apples from the pantry,\r\nand cider from the cellar. The apple-quarters intended for drying were\r\nstrung on homespun linen thread and hung out of doors on clear drying\r\ndays. A humble hillside home in New Hampshire thus quaintly festooned is\r\nshown in the illustration opposite page 208--a characteristic New\r\nHampshire landscape. When thoroughly dried in sun and wind, these sliced\r\napples were stored for the winter by being hung from rafter to rafter of\r\nvarious living rooms, and remained thus for months (gathering vast\r\naccumulations of dust and germs for our blissfully ignorant and\r\nunsqueamish grandparents) until the early days of spring, when Apple\r\nsauce, Apple butter, and the stores of Apple bin and Apple pit were\r\nexhausted, and they then afforded, after proper baths and soakings, the\r\nwherewithal for that domestic comestible--dried Apple pie. The Swedish\r\nparson, Dr. Acrelius, writing home to Sweden in 1758 an account of the\r\nsettlement of Delaware, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Apple pie is used throughout the whole year, and when fresh Apples\r\n     are no longer to be had, dried ones are used. It is the evening\r\n     meal of children. House pie, in country places, is made of Apples\r\n     neither peeled nor freed from their cores, and its crust is not\r\n     broken if a wagon wheel goes over it.\"\r\n\r\nI always had an undue estimation of Apple pie in my childhood, from an\r\naccidental cause: we were requested by the conscientious teacher in our\r\nSunday-school to \"take out\" each week without fail from the \"Select\r\nLibrary\" of the school a \"Sabbath-school Library Book.\" The colorless,\r\nalbeit pious, contents of the books classed under that title are well\r\nknown to those of my generation; even such a child of the Puritans as I\r\nwas could not read them. There were two anchors in that sea of\r\ndespair,--but feeble holds would they seem to-day,--the first volumes of\r\n_Queechy_ and _The Wide, Wide World_. With the disingenuousness of\r\nchildhood I satisfied the rules of the school and my own conscience by\r\ncarrying home these two books, and no others, on alternate Sundays for\r\ncertainly two years. The only wonder in the matter was that the\r\ntransaction escaped my Mother's eye for so long a time. I read only\r\nisolated scenes; of these the favorite was the one wherein Fleda carries\r\nto the woods for the hungry visitor, who was of the English nobility,\r\nseveral large and toothsome sections of green Apple pie and cheese. The\r\nprominence given to that Apple pie in that book and in my two years\r\nof reading idealized it. On a glorious day last October I drove to New\r\nCanaan, the town which was the prototype of Queechy. Hungry as ever in\r\nchildhood from the clear autumnal air and the long drive from Lenox, we\r\nasked for luncheon at what was reported to be a village hostelry. The\r\nexact counterpart of Miss Cynthia Gall responded rather sourly that she\r\nwasn't \"boarding or baiting\" that year. Humble entreaties for provender\r\nof any kind elicited from her for each of us a slice of cheese and a\r\nlarge and truly noble section of Apple pie, the very pie of Fleda's\r\ntale, which we ate with a bewildered sense as of a previous existence.\r\nThis was intensified as we strolled to the brook under the Queechy Sugar\r\nMaples, and gathered there the great-grandchildren of Fleda's\r\nWatercresses, and heard the sound of Hugh's sawmills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drying Apples.]\r\n\r\nSix hundred years ago English gentlewomen and goodwives were cooking\r\nApples just as we cook them now--they even had Apple pie. A delightful\r\nrecipe of the fourteenth century was for \"Appeluns for a Lorde, in\r\nopyntide.\" Opyntide was springtime; this was, therefore, a spring dish\r\nfit for a lord.\r\n\r\nApple-moy and Apple-mos, Apple Tansy, and Pommys-morle were delightful\r\ndishes and very rich food as well. The word pomatum has now no\r\nassociation with _pomum_, but originally pomatum was made partly of\r\nApples. In an old \"Dialog between Soarness and Chirurgi,\" written by one\r\nDr. Bulleyne in the days of Queen Elizabeth, is found this question and\r\nits answer:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Soarness._ How make you pomatum?\r\n\r\n     \"_Chirurgi._ Take the fat of a yearly kyd one pound, temper it with\r\n     the water of musk-roses by the space of foure dayes, then take five\r\n     apples, and dresse them, and cut them in pieces, and lard them with\r\n     cloves, then boyl them altogeather in the same water of roses in\r\n     one vessel of glasse set within another vessel, let it boyl on the\r\n     fyre so long tyll it all be white, then wash them with the same\r\n     water of muske-roses, this done kepe it in a glasse and if you will\r\n     have it to smell better, then you must put in a little civet or\r\n     musk, or both, or ambergrice. Gentil women doe use this to make\r\n     theyr faces fayr and smooth, for it healeth cliftes in the lippes,\r\n     or in any places of the hands and face.\"\r\n\r\nWith the omission of the civet or musk I am sure this would make to-day\r\na delightful cream; but there is one condition which the \"gentil woman\"\r\nof to-day could scarcely furnish--the infinite patience and leisure\r\nwhich accompanied and perfected all such domestic work three centuries\r\nago. A pomander was made of \"the maste of a sweet Apple tree being\r\ngathered betwixt two Lady days,\" mixed with various sweet-scented drugs\r\nand gums and Rose leaves, and shaped into a ball or bracelet.\r\n\r\nThe successor of the pomander was the Clove Apple, or \"Comfort Apple,\"\r\nan Apple stuck solidly with cloves. In country communities, one was\r\ngiven as an expression of sympathy in trouble or sorrow. Visiting a\r\ncountry \"poorhouse\" recently, we were shown a \"Comfort-apple\" which had\r\nbeen sent to one of the inmates by a friend; for even paupers have\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"Taffaty tarts\" were of paste filled with Apples sweetened and seasoned\r\nwith Lemon, Rose-water, and Fennel seed. Apple-sticklin',\r\nApple-stucklin, Apple-twelin, Apple-hoglin, are old English provincial\r\nnames of Apple pie; Apple-betty is a New England term. The Apple Slump\r\nof New England homes was not the \"slump-pye\" of old England, which was a\r\nrich mutton pie flavored with wine and jelly, and covered with a rich\r\nconfection of nuts and fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Apple Picker, Apple Racks, Apple Parers,\r\nApple-butter Kettle, Apple-butter Paddle, Apple-butter Stirrer,\r\nApple-butter Crocks.]\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania, among the people known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, the\r\nApple frolic was universal. Each neighbor brought his or her own Apple\r\nparer. This people make great use of Apples and cider in their food, and\r\nhave many curious modes of cooking them. Dr. Heilman in his paper on\r\n\"The Old Cider Mill\" tells of their delicacy of \"cider time\" called\r\ncider soup, made of equal parts of cider and water, boiled and thickened\r\nwith sweet cream and flour; when ready to serve, bits of bread or toast\r\nare placed in it. \"Mole cider\" is made of boiling cider thickened to a\r\nsyrup with beaten eggs and milk. But of greatest importance, both for\r\nhome consumption and for the market, is the staple known as Apple\r\nbutter. This is made from sweet cider boiled down to about one-third its\r\noriginal quantity. To this is added an equal weight of sliced Apples,\r\nabout a third as much of molasses, and various spices, such as cloves,\r\nginger, mace, cinnamon or even pepper, all boiled together for twelve or\r\nfifteen hours. Often the great kettle is filled with cider in the\r\nmorning, and boiled and stirred constantly all day, then the sliced\r\nApples are added at night, and the monotonous stirring continues till\r\nmorning, when the butter can be packed in jars and kegs for winter use.\r\nThis Apple butter is not at all like Apple sauce; it has no granulated\r\nappearance, but is smooth and solid like cheese and dark red in color.\r\nApple butter is stirred by a pole having upon one end a perforated blade\r\nor paddle set at right angles. Sometimes a bar was laid from rim to rim\r\nof the caldron, and worked by a crank that turned a similar paddle. A\r\ncollection of ancient utensils used in making Apple butter is shown on\r\npage 211; these are from the collections of the Bucks County Historical\r\nSociety. Opposite page 214 is shown an ancient open-air fireplace and an\r\nold couple making Apple butter just as they have done for over half a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn New England what the \"hired man\" on the farm called \"biled cider\r\nApple sass,\" took the place of Apple butter. Preferably this was made in\r\nthe \"summer kitchen,\" where three kettles, usually of graduated sizes,\r\ncould be set over the fire; the three kettles could be hung from a\r\ncrane, or trammels. All were filled with cider, and as the liquid boiled\r\naway in the largest kettle it was filled from the second and that from\r\nthe third. The fresh cider was always poured into the third kettle, thus\r\nthe large kettle was never checked in its boiling. This continued till\r\nthe cider was as thick as molasses. Apples (preferably Pound Sweets or\r\nPumpkin Sweets) had been chosen with care, pared, cored, and quartered,\r\nand heated in a small kettle. These were slowly added to the thickened\r\ncider, in small quantities, in order not to check the boiling. The rule\r\nwas to cook them till so softened that a rye straw could be run into\r\nthem, and yet they must retain their shape. This was truly a critical\r\ntime; the slightest scorched flavor would ruin the whole kettleful. A\r\ngreat wooden, long-handled, shovel-like ladle was used to stir the sauce\r\nfiercely until it was finished in triumph. Often a barrel of this was\r\nmade by our grandmothers, and frozen solid for winter use. The farmer\r\nand \"hired men\" ate it clear as a relish with meats; and it was suited\r\nto appetites and digestions which had been formed by a diet of salted\r\nmeats, fried breads, many pickles, and the drinking of hot cider\r\nsprinkled with pepper.\r\n\r\nEmerson well named the Apple the social fruit of New England. It ever\r\nhas been and is still the grateful promoter and unfailing aid to\r\ninformal social intercourse in the country-side; but the Apple tree is\r\nsomething far nobler even than being the sign of cheerful and cordial\r\nacquaintance; it is the beautiful rural emblem of industrious and\r\ntemperate home life. Hence, let us wassail with a will:--\r\n\r\n            \"Here's to thee, old Apple tree!\r\n    Whence thou mayst bud, and whence thou mayst blow,\r\n    And whence thou mayst bear Apples enow!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Apple Butter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nGARDENS OF THE POETS\r\n\r\n     \"The chief use of flowers is to illustrate quotations from the\r\n     poets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll English poets have ever been ready to sing English flowers until\r\njesters have laughed, and to sing garden flowers as well as wild\r\nflowers. Few have really described a garden, though the orderly\r\ndistribution of flowers might be held to be akin to the restraint of\r\nrhyme and rhythm in poetry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shakespeare Border at Hillside.]\r\n\r\nIt has been the affectionate tribute and happy diversion of those who\r\nlove both poetry and flowers to note the flowers beloved of various\r\npoets, and gather them together, either in a book or a garden. The pages\r\nof Milton cannot be forced, even by his most ardent admirers, to\r\nindicate any intimate knowledge of flowers. He certainly makes some very\r\nelegant classical allusions to flowers and fruits, and some amusingly\r\nvague ones as well. \"The Flowers of Spenser,\" and \"A Posy from Chaucer,\"\r\nare the titles of most readable chapters in _A Garden of Simples_, but\r\nthe allusions and quotations from both authors are pleasing and\r\ninteresting, rather than informing as to the real variety and\r\ndescription of the flowers of their day. Nearly all the older English\r\npoets, though writing glibly of woods and vales, of shepherds and\r\nswains, of buds and blossoms, scarcely allude to a flower in a natural\r\nway. Herrick was truly a flower lover, and, as the critic said, \"many\r\nflowers grow to illustrate quotations from his works.\" The flowers named\r\nof Shakespeare have been written about in varied books, _Shakespeare's\r\nGarden_, _Shakespeare's Bouquet_, _Flowers from Stratford-on-Avon_, etc.\r\nThese are easily led in fulness of detail, exactness of information, and\r\ndelightful literary quality by that truly perfect book, beloved of all\r\ngarden lovers, _The Plant Lore and Garden Craft of Shakespeare_, by\r\nCanon Ellacombe. Of it I never weary, and for it I am ever grateful.\r\n\r\nShakespeare Gardens, or Shakespeare Borders, too, are laid out and set\r\nwith every tree, shrub, and flower named in Shakespeare, and these are\r\nover two hundred in number. A distinguishing mark of the Shakespeare\r\nBorder of Lady Warwick is the peculiar label set alongside each plant.\r\nThis label is of pottery, greenish-brown in tint, shaped like a\r\nbutterfly, bearing on its wings a quotation of a few words and the play\r\nreference relating to each special plant. Of course these words have\r\nbeen fired in and are thus permanent. Pretty as they are in themselves\r\nthey must be disfiguring to the borders--as all labels are in a garden.\r\n\r\nIn the garden at Hillside, near Albany, New York, grows a green and\r\nflourishing Shakespeare Border, gathered ten years ago by the mistress\r\nof the garden. I use the terms green and flourishing with exactness in\r\nthis connection, for a great impression made by this border is of its\r\nthriving health, and also of the predominance of green leafage of every\r\nvariety, shape, manner of growth, and oddness of tint. In this latter\r\nrespect it is infinitely more beautiful than the ordinary border,\r\nvarying from silvery glaucous green through greens of yellow or brownish\r\nshade to the blue-black greens of some herbs; and among these green\r\nleaves are many of sweet or pungent scent, and of medicinal qualities,\r\nsuch as are seldom grown to-day save in some such choice and chosen\r\nspot. There is less bloom in this Shakespeare Border than in our modern\r\nflower beds, and the flowers are not so large or brilliant as our\r\nmodern favorites; but, quiet as they are, they are said to excel the\r\nblossoms of the same plants of Shakespeare's own day, which we learn\r\nfrom the old herbalists were smaller and less varied in color and of\r\nsimpler tints than those of their descendants. At the first glance this\r\nShakespeare Border shines chiefly in the light of the imagination, as\r\nstirred by the poet's noble words; but do not dwell on this border as a\r\nwhole, as something only to be looked at; read the pages of this garden,\r\ndwell on each leafy sentence, and you are entranced with its beautiful\r\nsignificance. It was not gathered with so much thought, and each plant\r\nand seed set out and watched and reared like a delicate child, to become\r\na show place; it appeals for a more intimate regard; and we find that\r\nits detail makes its charm.\r\n\r\nSuch a garden as this appeals warmly to anyone who is sensitive to the\r\nimaginative element of flower beauty. Many garden makers forget that a\r\nflower bed is a group of living beings--perhaps of sentient beings--as\r\nwell as a mass of beautiful color. Modern gardens tend far too much\r\ntoward the display of the united effect of growing plants, to a striving\r\nfor universal brilliancy, rather than attention to and love for separate\r\nflowers. There was refreshment of spirit as well as of the senses in the\r\nold-time garden of flowers, such as these planted in this Shakespeare\r\nBorder, and it stirred the heart of the poet as could no modern flower\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Long Border at Hillside.]\r\n\r\nThe scattering inflorescence and the tiny size of the blossoms give to\r\nthis Shakespeare Border an unusual aspect of demureness and delicacy,\r\nand the plants seem to cling with affection and trust to the path of\r\ntheir human protector; they look simple and confiding, and seem close\r\nboth to nature and to man. This homelike and modest quality is shown, I\r\nthink, even in the presentation in black and white given on page 216 and\r\nopposite page 218, though it shows still more in the garden when the\r\nwide range of tint of foliage is added.\r\n\r\nA most appropriate companion of the old flowers in this Shakespeare\r\nBorder is the sun-dial, which is an exact copy of the one at Abbotsford,\r\nScotland. It bears the motto [Greek: ERCHETAI GAR NYX] meaning, \"For\r\nthe night cometh.\" It was chosen by Sir Walter Scott, for his sun-dial,\r\nas a solemn monitor to himself of the hour \"when no man can work.\" It\r\nwas copied from a motto on the dial-plate of the watch of the great Dr.\r\nSamuel Johnson; and it is curious that in both cases the word [Greek:\r\nGAR] should be introduced, for it is not in the clause in the New\r\nTestament from which the motto was taken. It is a beautiful motto and\r\none of singular appropriateness for a sun-dial. The pedestal of this\r\nsun-dial is of simple lines, but it is dignified and pleasing, aside\r\nfrom the great interest of association which surrounds it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Beauty of Winter Lilacs.]\r\n\r\nI had a happy sense, when walking through this garden, that, besides my\r\ncongenial living companionship, I had the company of some noble\r\nElizabethan ghosts; and I know that if Shakespeare and Jonson and\r\nHerrick were to come to Hillside, they would find the garden so familiar\r\nto them; they would greet the plants like old friends, they would note\r\nhow fine grew the Rosemary this year, how sweet were the Lady's-smocks,\r\nhow fair the Gillyflowers. And Gerarde and Parkinson would ponder, too,\r\nover all the herbs and simples of their own Physick Gardens, and compare\r\nnotes. Above all I seemed to see, walking soberly by my side, breathing\r\nin with delight the varied scents of leaf and blossom, that lover and\r\nwriter of flowers and gardens, Lord Bacon--and not in the disguise of\r\nShakespeare either. For no stronger proofs can be found of the existence\r\nof two individualities than are in the works of each of these men, in\r\ntheir sentences and pages which relate to gardens and flowers.\r\n\r\nThis fair garden and Shakespeare Border are loveliest in the cool of the\r\nday, in the dawn or at early eve; and those who muse may then remember\r\nanother Presence in a garden in the cool of the day. And then I recall\r\nthat gem of English poesy which always makes me pitiful of its author;\r\nthat he could write this, and yet, in his hundreds of pages of English\r\nverse, make not another memorable line:--\r\n\r\n    \"A Garden is a lovesome thing, God wot;\r\n       Rose plot,\r\n     Fringed pool,\r\n       Ferned grot,\r\n     The veriest school of Peace;\r\n     And yet the fool\r\n       Contends that God is not in gardens.\r\n     Not in gardens! When the eve is cool!\r\n       Nay, but I have a sign.\r\n     'Tis very sure God walks in mine.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare Borders grow very readily and freely in England, save in the\r\ncase of the few tropical flowers and trees named in the pages of the\r\ngreat dramatist; but this Shakespeare Border at Hillside needs much\r\ncherishing. The plants of Heather and Broom and Gorse have to be\r\nspecially coddled by transplanting under cold frames during the long\r\nwinter months in frozen Albany; and thus they find vast contrast to\r\ntheir free, unsheltered life in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden of Mrs. Frank Robinson, Wakefield, Rhode Island.]\r\n\r\nPersistent efforts have been made to acclimate both Heather and Gorse in\r\nAmerica. We have seen how Broom came uninvited and spread unasked on the\r\nMassachusetts coast; but Gorse and Heather have proved shy creatures. On\r\nthe beautiful island of Naushon the carefully planted Gorse may be found\r\nspread in widely scattered spots and also on the near-by mainland, but\r\nit cannot be said to have thrived markedly. The Scotch Heather, too, has\r\nbeen frequently planted, and watched and pushed, but it is slow to\r\nbecome acclimated. It is not because the winters are too cold, for it is\r\nfound in considerable amount in bitter Newfoundland; perhaps it prefers\r\nto live under a crown.\r\n\r\nModern authors have seldom given their names to gardens, not even\r\nTennyson with his intimate and extended knowledge of garden flowers. A\r\nMary Howitt Garden was planned, full of homely old blooms, such as she\r\nloves to name in her verse; but it would have slight significance save\r\nto its maker, since no one cares to read Mary Howitt nowadays. In that\r\ncharming book, _Sylvana's Letters to an Unknown Friend_ (which I know\r\nwere written to me), the author, E. V. B., says, \"The very ideal of a\r\ngarden, and the only one I know, is found in Shelley's _Sensitive\r\nPlant_.\" With quick championing of a beloved poet, I at once thought of\r\nthe radiant garden of flowers in Keats's heart and poems. Then I reread\r\nthe _Sensitive Plant_ in a spirit of utmost fairness and critical\r\nfriendliness, and I am willing to yield the Shelley Garden to Sylvana,\r\nwhile I keep, for my own delight, my Keats garden of sunshine, color,\r\nand warmth.\r\n\r\nThat Keats had a profound knowledge and love of flowers is shown in his\r\nletters as well as his poems. Only a few months before his death, when\r\nstricken with and fighting a fatal disease, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n     \"How astonishingly does the chance of leaving the world impress a\r\n     sense of its natural beauties upon me! Like poor Falstaff, though I\r\n     do not babble, I think of green fields. I muse with greatest\r\n     affection on every flower I have known from my infancy--their\r\n     shapes and colors are as new to me as if I had just created them\r\n     with a superhuman fancy. It is because they are connected with the\r\n     most thoughtless and the happiest moments of my life.\"\r\n\r\nNear the close of his _Endymion_ he wrote:--\r\n\r\n                \"Nor much it grieves\r\n    To die, when summer dies on the cold sward.\r\n    Why, I have been a butterfly, a lord\r\n    Of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies,\r\n    Groves, meadows, melodies, and arbor roses;\r\n    My kingdom's at its death, and just it is\r\n    That I should die with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1816, under the influence of a happy day at Hampstead,\r\nhe wrote that lovely poem, \"I stood tiptoe upon a little hill.\" After a\r\ndescription of the general scene, a special corner of beauty is thus\r\ntold:--\r\n\r\n    \"A bush of May flowers with the bees about them--\r\n     Ah, sure no bashful nook could be without them--\r\n     And let a lush Laburnum oversweep them,\r\n     And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them\r\n     Moist, cool, and green; and shade the Violets\r\n     That they may bind the moss in leafy nets.\r\n     A Filbert hedge with Wild-brier over trim'd,\r\n     And clumps of Woodbine taking the soft wind,\r\n     Upon their summer thrones....\"\r\n\r\nThen come these wonderful lines, which belittle all other descriptions\r\nof Sweet Peas:--\r\n\r\n    \"Here are Sweet Peas, on tiptoe for a flight,\r\n     With wings of gentle flush o'er delicate white,\r\n     And taper fingers catching at all things\r\n     To bind them all about with tiny wings.\"\r\n\r\nKeats states in his letters that his love of flowers was wholly for\r\nthose of the \"common garden sort,\" not for flowers of the greenhouse or\r\ndifficult cultivation, nor do I find in his lines any evidence of\r\nextended familiarity with English wild flowers. He certainly does not\r\nknow the flowers of woods and fields as does Matthew Arnold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Parson's Walk.]\r\n\r\nThe Autocrat of the Breakfast Table says: \"Did you ever hear a poet who\r\ndid not talk flowers? Don't you think a poem which for the sake of being\r\noriginal should leave them out, would be like those verses where the\r\nletter _a_ or _e_, or some other, is omitted? No; they will bloom over\r\nand over again in poems as in the summer fields, to the end of time,\r\nalways old and always new.\" The Autocrat himself knew well a poet who\r\nnever talked flowers in his poems, a poet beloved of all other\r\npoets,--Arthur Hugh Clough,--though he loved and knew all flowers. From\r\nMatthew Arnold's beautiful tribute to him, are a few of his wonderful\r\nflower lines, cut out from their fellows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Through the thick Corn the scarlet Poppies peep,\r\n     And round green roots and yellowing stalks I see\r\n       Pale blue Convolvulus in tendrils creep,\r\n         And air-swept Lindens yield\r\n       Their scent, and rustle down their perfumed showers\r\n       Of bloom...,\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Soon will the high midsummer pomps come on,\r\n       Soon will the Musk Carnations break and swell.\r\n     Soon shall we have gold-dusted Snapdragon,\r\n       Sweet-william with his homely cottage smell,\r\n         And Stocks in fragrant blow.\"\r\n\r\nOh, what a master hand! Where in all English verse are fairer flower\r\nhues? And where is a more beautiful description of a midsummer evening,\r\nthan Arnold's exquisite lines beginning:--\r\n\r\n    \"The evening comes; the fields are still;\r\n     The tinkle of the thirsty rill.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Holmes was also a master in the description of garden flowers. I\r\nshould know, had I never been told save from his verses, just the kind\r\nof a Cambridge garden he was reared in, and what flowers grew in it.\r\nLowell, too, gives ample evidence of a New England childhood in a\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nThe gardens of Shenstone's _Schoolmistress_ and of Thomson's poems come\r\nto our minds without great warmth of welcome from us; while Clare's\r\nlines are full of charm:--\r\n\r\n    \"And where the Marjoram once, and Sage and Rue,\r\n     And Balm, and Mint, with curl'd leaf Parsley grew,\r\n     And double Marigolds, and silver Thyme,\r\n     And Pumpkins 'neath the window climb.\r\n     And where I often, when a child, for hours\r\n     Tried through the pales to get the tempting flowers,\r\n     As Lady's Laces, everlasting Peas,\r\n     True-love-lies-bleeding, with the Hearts-at-ease\r\n     And Goldenrods, and Tansy running high,\r\n     That o'er the pale tops smiled on passers by.\"\r\n\r\nA curious old seventeenth-century poet was the Jesuit, Rene Rapin. The\r\ncopy of his poem entitled _Gardens_ which I have seen, is the one in my\r\ndaughter's collection of garden books; it was \"English'd by the\r\nIngenious Mr. Gardiner,\" and published in 1728. Hallam in his\r\n_Introduction to the Literature of Europe_ gives a capital estimate of\r\nthis long poem of over three thousand lines. I find them pretty dull\r\nreading, with much monotony of adjectives, and very affected notions for\r\nplant names. I fancy he manufactured all his tedious plant traditions\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden of Mary Washington.]\r\n\r\nA pleasing little book entitled _Dante's Garden_ has collected evidence,\r\nfrom his writings, of Dante's love of green, growing things. The title\r\nis rather strained, since he rarely names individual flowers, and only\r\nrefers vaguely to their emblematic significance. I would have entitled\r\nthe book _Dante's Forest_, since he chiefly refers to trees; and the\r\nItalian gardens of his days were of trees rather than flowers. There are\r\npassages in his writings which have led some of his worshippers to\r\nbelieve that his childhood was passed in a garden; but these references\r\nare very indeterminate.\r\n\r\nThe picture of a deserted garden, with its sad sentiment has charmed the\r\nfancy of many a poet. Hood, a true flower-lover, wrote this jingle in\r\nhis _Haunted House_:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Marigold amidst the nettles blew,\r\n       The Gourd embrac'd the Rose bush in its ramble.\r\n     The Thistle and the Stock together grew,\r\n       The Hollyhock and Bramble.\r\n\r\n    \"The Bearbine with the Lilac interlaced,\r\n       The sturdy Burdock choked its tender neighbor,\r\n     The spicy Pink. All tokens were effaced\r\n       Of human care and labor.\"\r\n\r\nThese lines are a great contrast to the dignified versification of The\r\nOld Garden, by Margaret Deland, a garden around which a great city has\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\n    \"Around it is the street, a restless arm\r\n     That clasps the country to the city's heart.\"\r\n\r\nNo one could read this poem without knowing that the author is a true\r\ngarden lover, and knowing as well that she spent her childhood in a\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nAnother American poet, Edith Thomas, writes exquisitely of old gardens\r\nand garden flowers.\r\n\r\n    \"The pensile Lilacs still their favors throw.\r\n     The Star of Lilies, plenteous long ago,\r\n     Waits on the summer dusk, and faileth not.\r\n     The legions of the grass in vain would blot\r\n     The spicy Box that marks the garden row.\r\n     Let but the ground some human tendance know,\r\n     It long remaineth an engentled spot.\"\r\n\r\nLet me for a moment, through the suggestion of her last two lines, write\r\nof the impress left on nature through flower planting. \"The garden long\r\nremaineth an engentled spot.\" You cannot for years stamp out the mark of\r\na garden; intentional destruction may obliterate the garden borders, but\r\nneglect never. The delicate flowers die, but some sturdy things spring\r\nup happily and seem gifted with everlasting life. Fifteen years ago a\r\nfriend bought an old country seat on Long Island; near the site of the\r\nnew house, an old garden was ploughed deep and levelled to a lawn. Every\r\nyear since then the patient gardeners pull up, on this lawn, in\r\nconsiderable numbers, Mallows, Campanulas, Star of Bethlehem,\r\nBouncing-bets and innumerable Asparagus shoots, and occasionally the\r\nseedlings of other flowers which have bided their time in the dark\r\nearth. Traces of the residence of Sir Walter Raleigh in Ireland may\r\nstill be seen in the growth of richly perfumed wall-flowers which he\r\nbrought from the Azores. The Affane Cherry is found where he planted it,\r\nand some of his Cedars are living. The summer-house of Yew trees\r\nsheltered him when he smoked in the garden, and in this garden he\r\nplanted Tobacco. Near by is the famous spot where he planted what were\r\nthen called Virginian Potatoes. By that planting they acquired the name\r\nof Irish Potatoes.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the Prince Nurseries in Flushing; the old nurserymen\r\nleft a more lasting mark than their Nurseries, in the rare trees and\r\nplants now found on the roads, and in the fields and gardens for many\r\nmiles around Flushing. With the Parsons family, who have been, since\r\n1838, distributors of unusual plants, especially the splendid garden\r\ntreasures from China and Japan, they have made Flushing a delightful\r\nnature-study.\r\n\r\nIn the humblest dooryard, and by the wayside in outlying parts of the\r\ntown, may be seen rare and beautiful old trees: a giant purple Beech is\r\nin a laborer's yard; fine Cedars, Salisburias, red-flowered\r\nHorse-chestnuts, Japanese flowering Quinces and Cherries, and even rare\r\nJapanese Maples are to be found; a few survivors of the Chinese Mulberry\r\nhave a romantic interest as mementoes of a giant bubble of ruin. The\r\nlargest Scotch Laburnum I ever saw, glorious in golden bloom, is behind\r\nan unkempt house. On the Parsons estate is a weeping Beech of unusual\r\nsize. Its branches trail on the ground in a vast circumference of 222\r\nfeet, forming a great natural arbor. The beautiful vernal light in this\r\ntree bower may be described in Andrew Marvell's words:--\r\n\r\n    \"Annihilating all that's made\r\n     To a green thought in a green shade.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box and Phlox.]\r\n\r\nThe photograph of it, shown opposite page 232, gives some scant idea of\r\nits leafy walls; it has been for years the fit trysting-place of lovers,\r\nas is shown by the initials carved on the great trunk. Great Judas\r\ntrees, sadly broken yet bravely blooming; decayed hedges of several\r\nkinds of Lilacs, Syringas, Snowballs, and Yuccas of princely size and\r\nbearing still linger. Everywhere are remnants of Box hedges. One unkempt\r\ndooryard of an old Dutch farm-house was glorified with a broad double\r\nrow of yellow Lily at least sixty feet in length. Everywhere is\r\nWistaria, on porches, fences, houses, and trees; the abundant Dogwood\r\ntrees are often overgrown with Wistaria. The most exquisite sight of the\r\nfloral year was the largest Dogwood tree I have ever seen, radiant with\r\nstarry white bloom, and hung to the tip of every white-flowered branch\r\nwith the drooping amethystine racemes of Wistaria of equal luxuriance.\r\nGolden-yellow Laburnum blooms were in one case mingled with both purple\r\nand white Wistaria. These yellow, purple, and white blooms of similar\r\nshape were a curious sight, as if a single plant had been grafted. As I\r\nrode past so many glimpses of loveliness mingled with so much present\r\nsqualor, I could but think of words of the old hymn:--\r\n\r\n    \"Where every prospect pleases\r\n     And only man is vile.\"\r\n\r\nCould the hedges, trees, and vines which came from the Prince and\r\nParsons Nurseries have been cared for, northeastern Long Island, which\r\nis part of the city of Greater New York, would still be what it was\r\nnamed by the early explorers, \"The Pearl of New Netherland.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Within the Weeping Beech.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE CHARM OF COLOR\r\n\r\n    \"How strange are the freaks of memory,\r\n       The lessons of life we forget.\r\n     While a trifle, a trick of color,\r\n       In the wonderful web is set.\"\r\n\r\n    --JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quality of charm in color is most subtle; it is like the human\r\nattribute known as fascination, \"whereof,\" says old Cotton Mather, \"men\r\nhave more Experience than Comprehension.\" Certainly some alliance of\r\ncolor with a form suited or wonted to it is necessary to produce a\r\ngratification of the senses. Thus in the leaves of plants every shade of\r\ngreen is pleasing; then why is there no charm in a green flower? The\r\ngreen of Mignonette bloom would scarcely be deemed beautiful were it not\r\nfor our association of it with the delicious fragrance. White is the\r\nabsence of color. In flowers a pure chalk-white, and a snow-white (which\r\nis bluish) is often found; but more frequently the white flower blushes\r\na little, or is warmed with yellow, or has green veins.\r\n\r\nWhere green runs into the petals of a white flower, its beauty hangs by\r\na slender thread. If the green lines have any significance, as have the\r\nfaint green checkerings of the Fritillary, which I have described\r\nelsewhere in this book, they add to its interest; but ordinarily they\r\nmake the petals seem undeveloped. The Snowdrop bears the mark of one of\r\nthe few tints of green which we like in white flowers; its \"heart-shaped\r\nseal of green,\" sung by Rossetti, has been noted by many other poets.\r\nTennyson wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"Pure as lines of green that streak the white\r\n     Of the first Snowdrop's inner leaves.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spring Snowflake.]\r\n\r\nA cousin of the Snowdrop, is the \"Spring Snowflake\" or Leucojum, called\r\nalso by New England country folk \"High Snowdrop.\" It bears at the end of\r\neach snowy petal a tiny exact spot of green; and I think it must have\r\nbeen the flower sung by Leigh Hunt:--\r\n\r\n    \"The nice-leaved lesser Lilies,\r\n     Shading like detected light\r\n     Their little green-tipt lamps of white.\"\r\n\r\nThe illustration on page 234 shows the graceful growth of the flower and\r\nits exquisitely precise little green-dotted petals, but it has not\r\ncaught its luminous whiteness, which seems almost of phosphorescent\r\nbrightness in each little flower.\r\n\r\nThe Star of Bethlehem is a plant in which the white and green of the\r\nleaf is curiously repeated in the flower. Gardeners seldom admit this\r\nflower now to their gardens, it so quickly crowds out everything else;\r\nit has become on Long Island nothing but a weed. The high-growing Star\r\nof Bethlehem is a pretty thing. A bed of it in my sister's garden is\r\nshown on page 237.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that when all agree that green flowers have no beauty and\r\nscant charm, that a green flower should have been one of the best-loved\r\nflowers of my home garden. But this love does not come from any thought\r\nof the color or beauty of the flower, but from association. It was my\r\nmother's favorite, hence it is mine. It was her favorite because she\r\nloved its clear, pure, spicy fragrance. This ever present and ever\r\nwelcome scent which pervades the entire garden if leaf or flower of the\r\nloved Ambrosia be crushed, is curious and characteristic, a true\r\n\"ambrosiack odor,\" to use Ben Jonson's words.\r\n\r\nA vivid description of Ambrosia is that of Gerarde in his delightful\r\n_Herball_.\r\n\r\n     \"Oke of Jerusalem, or Botrys, hath sundry small stems a foote and a\r\n     halfe high dividing themselves into many small branches. The leafe\r\n     very much resembling the leafe of an Oke, which hath caused our\r\n     English women to call it Oke of Jerusalem. The upper side of the\r\n     leafe is a deepe greene and somewhat rough and hairy, but\r\n     underneath it is of a darke reddish or purple colour. The seedie\r\n     floures grow clustering about the branches like the yong clusters\r\n     or blowings of the Vine. The roote is small and thriddy. The whole\r\n     herbe is of a pleasant smell and savour, and the whole plant dieth\r\n     when the seed is ripe. Oke of Jerusalem is of divers called\r\n     Ambrosia.\"\r\n\r\nAmbrosia has been loved for many centuries by Englishwomen; it is in the\r\nfirst English list of names of plants, which was made in 1548 by one Dr.\r\nTurner; and in this list it is called \"Ambrose.\" He says of it:--\r\n\r\n     \"Botrys is called in englishe, Oke of Hierusalem, in duche, trauben\r\n     kraute, in french pijmen. It groweth in gardines muche in England.\"\r\n\r\nAmbrosia has now died out \"in gardines muche in England.\" I have had\r\nmany letters from English flower lovers telling me they know it not; and\r\nI have had the pleasure of sending the seeds to several old English and\r\nScotch gardens, where I hope it will once more grow and flourish, for I\r\nam sure it must feel at home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Star of Bethlehem.]\r\n\r\nThe seeds of this beloved Ambrosia, which filled my mother's garden in\r\nevery spot in which it could spring, and which overflowed with cheerful\r\nwelcome into the gardens of our neighbors, was given her from the garden\r\nof a great-aunt in Walpole, New Hampshire. This Walpole garden was a\r\nfamous gathering of old-time favorites, and it had the delightful\r\ncompanionship of a wild garden. On a series of terraces with shelving\r\nbanks, which reached down to a stream, the boys of the family planted,\r\nseventy years ago, a myriad of wild flowers, shrubs, and trees, from the\r\nneighboring woods. By the side of the garden great Elm trees sheltered\r\nscores of beautiful gray squirrels; and behind the house and garden an\r\norchard led to the wheat fields, which stretched down to the broad\r\nConnecticut River. All flowers thrived there, both in the Box-bordered\r\nbeds and in the wild garden, perhaps because the morning mists from the\r\nriver helped out the heavy buckets of water from the well during the hot\r\nsummer weeks. Even in winter the wild garden was beautiful from the\r\nbrilliant Bittersweet which hung from every tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The Pearl.\"]\r\n\r\nHere Ambrosia was plentiful, but is plentiful no longer; and Walpole\r\ngarden lovers seek seeds of it from the Worcester garden. I think it\r\ndies out generally when all the weeding and garden care is done by\r\ngardeners; they assume that the little plants of such modest bearing\r\nare weeds, and pull them up, with many other precious seedlings of the\r\nold garden, in their desire to have ample expanse of naked dirt. One of\r\nthe charms which was permitted to the old garden was its fulness. Nature\r\nthere certainly abhorred a vacant space. The garden soil was full of\r\nresources; it had a seed for every square inch; it seemed to have a\r\nreserve store ready to crowd into any space offered by the removal or\r\ndying down of a plant at any time.\r\n\r\nLet me tell of a curious thing I found in an old book, anent our\r\nsubject--green flowers. It shows that we must not accuse our modern\r\nsensation lovers, either in botany or any other science, of being the\r\nonly ones to add artifice to nature. The green Carnation has been chosen\r\nto typify the decadence and monstrosity of the end of the nineteenth\r\ncentury; but nearly two hundred years ago a London fruit and flower\r\ngrower, named Richard Bradley, wrote a treatise upon field husbandry and\r\ngarden culture, and in it he tells of a green Carnation which \"a certayn\r\nfryar\" produced by grafting a Carnation upon a Fennel stalk. The flowers\r\nwere green for several years, then nature overcame decadent art.\r\n\r\nThere be those who are so enamoured of the color green and of foliage,\r\nthat they care little for flowers of varied tint; even in a garden, like\r\nthe old poet Marvell, they deem,--\r\n\r\n    \"No white nor red was ever seen\r\n     So amorous as this lovely green.\"\r\n\r\nSuch folk could scarce find content in an American garden; for our\r\nAmerican gardeners must confess, with Shakespeare's clown: \"I am no\r\ngreat Nebuchadnezzar, sir, I have not much skill in grass.\" Our lawns\r\nare not old enough.\r\n\r\nA charming greenery of old English gardens was the bowling-green. We\r\nonce had them in our colonies, as the name of a street in our greatest\r\ncity now proves; and I deem them a garden fashion well-to-be-revived.\r\n\r\nThe laws of color preference differ with the size of expanses. Our broad\r\nfields often have pleasing expanses of leafage other than green, and\r\nflowers that are as all-pervading as foliage. Many flowers of the field\r\nhave their day, when each seems to be queen, a short day, but its rights\r\nnone dispute. Snow of Daisies, yellow of Dandelions, gold of Buttercups,\r\npurple pinkness of Clover, Innocence, Blue-eyed Grass, Milkweed, none\r\nreign more absolutely in every inch of the fields than that poverty\r\nstricken creature, the Sorrel. William Morris warns us that \"flowers in\r\nmasses are mighty strong color,\" and must be used with much caution in a\r\ngarden. But there need be no fear of massed color in a field, as being\r\never gaudy or cloying. An approach to the beauty and satisfaction of\r\nnature's plentiful field may be artificially obtained as an adjunct to\r\nthe garden in a flower-close sown or set with a solid expanse of bloom\r\nof some native or widely adopted plant. I have seen a flower-close of\r\nDaisies, another of Buttercups, one of Larkspur, one of Coreopsis. A new\r\nfield tint, and a splendid one, has been given to us within a few\r\nyears, by the introduction of the vivid red of Italian clover. It is\r\neagerly welcomed to our fields, so scant of scarlet. This clover was\r\nbrought to America in the years 1824 _et seq._, and is described in\r\ncontemporary publications in alluring sentences. I have noted the\r\nintroduction of several vegetables, grains, fruits, berries, shrubs, and\r\nflowers in those years, and attribute this to the influence of the visit\r\nof Lafayette in 1824. Adored by all, his lightest word was heeded; and\r\nhe was a devoted agriculturist and horticulturist, ever exchanging\r\nideas, seeds, and plants with his American fellow-patriots and\r\nfellow-farmers. I doubt if Italian clover then became widely known; but\r\nour modern farmers now think well of it, and the flower lover revels in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of rhyme and rhythm force us to endure some very curious\r\nnotions of color in the poets. I think no saying of poet ever gave\r\ngreater check to her lovers than these lines of Emily Dickinson:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nature rarer uses yellow\r\n       Than another hue;\r\n     Saves she all of that for sunsets,\r\n       Prodigal of blue.\r\n     Spending scarlet like a woman,\r\n       Yellow she affords\r\n     Only scantly and selectly,\r\n       Like a lover's words.\"\r\n\r\nI read them first with a sense of misapprehension that I had not seen\r\naright; but there the words stood out, \"Nature rarer uses yellow than\r\nanother hue.\" The writer was such a jester, such a tricky elf that I\r\nfancy she wrote them in pure \"contrariness,\" just to see what folks\r\nwould say, how they would dispute over her words. For I never can doubt\r\nthat, with all her recluse life, she knew intuitively that some time her\r\nlines would be read by folks who would love them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pyrethrum.]\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of red wild flowers is either a cause or an effect; at any\r\nrate it is said to be connected with the small number of humming-birds,\r\nwho play an important part in the fertilization of many of the red\r\nflowers. There are no humming-birds in Europe; and the Aquilegia, red\r\nand yellow here, is blue there, and is then fertilized by the assistance\r\nof the bumblebee. Without humming-birds the English successfully\r\naccomplish one glorious sweep of red in the Poppies of the field;\r\nParkinson called them \"a beautiful and gallant red\"--a very happy\r\nphrase. Ruskin, that master of color and of its description, and above\r\nall master of the description of Poppies, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Poppy is the most transparent and delicate of all the blossoms\r\n     of the field. The rest, nearly all of them, depend on the texture\r\n     of their surface for color. But the Poppy is painted glass; it\r\n     never glows so brightly as when the sun shines through it. Whenever\r\n     it is seen, against the light or with the light, it is a flame, and\r\n     warms the wind like a blown ruby.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one quality of the Oriental Poppies which is very palpable to\r\nme. They have often been called insolent--Browning writes of the\r\n\"Poppy's red affrontery\"; to me the Poppy has an angry look. It is\r\nwonderfully haughty too, and its seed-pod seems like an emblem of its\r\nrank. This great green seed-pod stands one inch high in the centre of\r\nthe silken scarlet robe, and has an antique crown of purple bands with\r\nfilling of lilac, just like the crown in some ancient kingly portraits,\r\nwhen the bands of gold and gems radiating from a great jewel in the\r\ncentre are filled with crimson or purple velvet. Around this splendid\r\ncrowned seed-vessel are rows of stamens and purple anthers of richest\r\nhue.\r\n\r\nWe must not let any scarlet flower be dropped from the garden, certainly\r\nnot the Geranium, which just at present does not shine so bravely as a\r\nfew years ago. The general revulsion of feeling against \"bedding out\"\r\nhas extended to the poor plants thus misused, which is unjust. I find I\r\nhave spoken somewhat despitefully of the Coleus, Lobelia, and\r\nCalceolaria, so I hasten to say that I do not include the Geranium with\r\nthem. I love its clean color, in leaf and blossom; its clean fragrance;\r\nits clean beauty, its healthy growth; it is a plant I like to have near\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIt has been the custom of late to sneer at crimson in the garden,\r\nespecially if its vivid color gets a dash of purple and becomes what\r\nMiss Jekyll calls \"malignant magenta.\" It is really more vulgar than\r\nmalignant, and has come to be in textile products a stamp and symbol of\r\nvulgarity, through the forceful brilliancy of our modern aniline dyes.\r\nBut this purple crimson, this amarant, this magenta, especially in the\r\nlighter shades, is a favorite color in nature. The garden is never weary\r\nof wearing it. See how it stands out in midsummer! It is rank in Ragged\r\nRobin, tall Phlox, and Petunias; you find it in the bed of Drummond\r\nPhlox, among the Zinnias; the Portulacas, Balsams, and China Asters\r\nprolong it. Earlier in the summer the Rhododendrons fill the garden with\r\ncolor that on some of the bushes is termed sultana and crimson, but it\r\nis in fact plain magenta. One of the good points of the Peony is that\r\nyou never saw a magenta one.\r\n\r\nThis color shows that time as well as place affects our color notions,\r\nfor magenta is believed to be the honored royal purple of the ancients.\r\nFifty years ago no one complained of magenta. It was deemed a cheerful\r\ncolor, and was set out boldly and complacently by the side of pink or\r\nscarlet, or wall flower colors. Now I dislike it so that really the\r\nprinted word, seen often as I glance back through this page, makes the\r\nblack and white look cheap. If I could turn all magenta flowers pink or\r\npurple, I should never think further about garden harmony, all other\r\ncolors would adjust themselves.\r\n\r\nIt has been the fortune of some communities to be the home of men in\r\nnature like Thoreau of Concord and Gilbert White of Selborne, men who\r\nlive solely in love of out-door things, birds, flowers, rocks, and\r\ntrees. To all these nature lovers is not given the power of writing down\r\nreadily what they see and know, usually the gift of composition is\r\ndenied them; but often they are just as close and accurate observers as\r\nthe men whose names are known to the world by their writings. Sometimes\r\nthese naturalists boldly turn to nature, their loved mother, and earn\r\ntheir living in the woods and fields. Sometimes they have a touch of the\r\nhermit in them, they prefer nature to man; others are genial, kindly\r\nmen, albeit possessed of a certain reserve. I deem the community blest\r\nthat has such a citizen, for his influence in promoting a love and study\r\nof nature is ever great. I have known one such ardent naturalist, Arba\r\nPeirce, ever since my childhood. He lives the greater part of his waking\r\nhours in the woods and fields, and these waking hours are from sunrise.\r\nFrom the earliest bloom of spring to the gay berry of autumn, he knows\r\nall beautiful things that grow, and where they grow, for hundreds of\r\nmiles around his home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Terraced Garden of Misses Nichols, Salem, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nI speak of him in this connection because he has acquired through his\r\nwoodland life a wonderful power of distinguishing flowers at great\r\ndistance with absolute accuracy. Especially do his eyes have the power\r\nof detecting those rose-lilac tints which are characteristic of our\r\nrarest, our most delicate wild flowers, and which I always designate to\r\nmyself as Arethusa color. He brought me this June a royal gift--a great\r\nbunch of wild fringed Orchids, another of Calopogon, and one of\r\nArethusa. What a color study these three made! At the time their\r\nlilac-rose tints seemed to me far lovelier than any pure rose colors. In\r\nthose wild princesses were found every tone of that lilac-rose from the\r\nfaint blush like the clouds of a warm sunset, to a glow on the lip of\r\nthe Arethusa, like the crimson glow of Mullein Pink.\r\n\r\nMy friend of the meadow and wildwood had gathered that morning a\r\nglorious harvest, over two thousand stems of Pogonia, from his own\r\nhidden spot, which he has known for forty years and from whence no other\r\nhand ever gathers. For a little handful of these flower heads he easily\r\nobtains a dollar. He has acquired gradually a regular round of\r\ncustomers, for whom he gathers a successive harvest of wild flowers from\r\nPussy Willows and Hepatica to winter berries. It is not easily earned\r\nmoney to stand in heavy rubber boots in marsh mud and water reaching\r\nnearly to the waist, but after all it is happy work. Jeered at in his\r\nearly life by fools for his wood-roving tastes, he has now the pleasure\r\nand honor of supplying wild flowers to our public schools, and being the\r\nauthority to whom scholars and teachers refer in vexed questions of\r\nbotany.\r\n\r\nI think the various tints allied to purple are the most difficult to\r\ndefine and describe of any in the garden. To begin with, all these\r\npinky-purple, these arethusa tints are nameless; perhaps orchid color is\r\nas good a name as any. Many deem purple and violet precisely the same.\r\nLavender has much gray in its tint. Miss Jekyll deems mauve and lilac\r\nthe same; to me lilac is much pinker, much more delicate. Is heliotrope\r\na pale bluish purple? Some call it a blue faintly tinged with red. Then\r\nthere are the orchid tints, which have more pink than blue. It is a\r\ncurious fact that, with all these allied tints which come from the union\r\nof blue with red, the color name comes from a flower name. Violet,\r\nlavender, lilac, heliotrope, orchid, are examples; each is an exact\r\ntint. Rose and pink are color names from flowers, and flowers of much\r\nvariety of colors, but the tint name is unvarying.\r\n\r\nEdward de Goncourt, of all writers on flowers and gardens, seems to have\r\nbeen most frankly pleased with the artificial side of the gardener's\r\nart. He viewed the garden with the eye of a colorist, setting a palette\r\nof varied greens from the deep tones of the evergreens, the Junipers and\r\nCryptomerias through the variegated Hollies, Privets and Spindle trees;\r\nand he said that an \"elegantly branched coquettishly variegated bush\"\r\nseemed to him like a piece of bric-a-brac which should be hunted out and\r\npraised like some curio hidden on the shelf of a collector.\r\n\r\nA lack of color perception seems to have been prevalent of ancient days,\r\nas it is now in some Oriental countries. The Bible offers evidence of\r\nthis, and it has also been observed that the fragrance of flowers is\r\nnowhere noted until we reach the Song of Solomon. It is believed that in\r\nearliest time archaic men had no sense of color; that they knew only\r\nlight and darkness. Mr. Gladstone wrote a most interesting paper on the\r\nlack of color sense in Homer, whose perception of brilliant light was\r\ngood, especially in the glowing reflections of metals, but who never\r\nnames blue or green even in speaking of the sky, or trees, while his\r\nreds and purples are hopelessly mixed. Some German scientists have\r\nmaintained that as recently as Homer's day, our ancestors were (to use\r\nSir John Lubbock's word) blue-blind, which fills me, as it must all blue\r\nlovers, with profound pity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arbor in a Salem Garden.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of color has ever been felt by other senses than that of\r\nsight. In the _Cotton Manuscripts_, written six hundred years ago, the\r\nrelations and effects of color on music and coat-armor were laboriously\r\nexplained: and many later writers have striven to show the effect of\r\ncolor on the health, imagination, or fortune. I see no reason for\r\nsneering at these notions of sense-relation; I am grateful for borrowed\r\nterms of definition for these beautiful things which are so hard to\r\ndefine. When an artist says to me, \"There is a color that sings,\" I know\r\nwhat he means; as I do when my friend says of the funeral music in\r\n_Tristan_ that \"it always hurts her eyes.\" Musicians compose symphonies\r\nin color, and artists paint pictures in symphonies. Musicians and\r\nauthors acknowledge the domination of color and color terms; a glance at\r\na modern book catalogue will prove it. Stephen Crane and other modern\r\nextremists depend upon color to define and describe sounds, smells,\r\ntastes, feelings, ideas, vices, virtues, traits, as well as sights.\r\nSulphur-yellow is deemed an inspiring color, and light green a clean\r\ncolor; every one knows the influence of bright red upon many animals and\r\nbirds; it is said all barnyard fowl are affected by it. If any one can\r\nsee a sunny bed of blue Larkspur in full bloom without being moved\r\nthereby, he must be color blind and sound deaf as well, for that indeed\r\nis a sight full of music and noble inspiration, a realization of Keats'\r\nbeautiful thought:--\r\n\r\n    \"Delicious symphonies, like airy flowers\r\n     Budded, and swell'd, and full-blown, shed full showers\r\n     Of light, soft unseen leaves of sound divine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE FLOWER BORDER\r\n\r\n    \"Blue thou art, intensely blue!\r\n     Flower! whence came thy dazzling hue?\r\n     When I opened first mine eye,\r\n     Upward glancing to the sky,\r\n     Straightway from the firmament\r\n     Was the sapphire brilliance sent.\"\r\n\r\n    --JAMES MONTGOMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions of color relations in a garden are most opinion-making and\r\ncontroversy-provoking. Shall we plant by chance, or by a flower-loving\r\ninstinct for sheltered and suited locations, as was done in all old-time\r\ngardens, and with most happy and most unaffected results? or shall we\r\nplant severely by colors--all yellow flowers in a border together? all\r\nred flowers side by side? all pink flowers near each other? This might\r\nbe satisfactory in small gardens, but I am uncertain whether any\r\nprofound gratification or full flower succession would come from such\r\nrigid planting in long flower borders.\r\n\r\nWilliam Morris warns us that flowers in masses are \"mighty strong\r\ncolor,\" and must be used with caution. A still greater cause for\r\nhesitation would be the ugly jarring of juxtaposing tints of the same\r\ncolor. Yellows do little injury to each other; but I cannot believe that\r\na mixed border of red flowers would ever be satisfactory or scarcely\r\nendurable; and few persons would care for beds of all white flowers. But\r\nwhen I reach the Blue Border, then I can speak with decision; I know\r\nwhereof I write, I know the variety and beauty of a garden bed of blue\r\nflowers. In blue you may have much difference in tint and quality\r\nwithout losing color effect. The Persian art workers have accomplished\r\nthe combining of varying blues most wonderfully and successfully:\r\npurplish blues next to green-blues, and sapphire-blues alongside; and\r\nblues seldom clash in the flower beds.\r\n\r\nBlue is my best beloved color; I love it as the bees love it. Every blue\r\nflower is mine; and I am as pleased as with a tribute of praise to a\r\nfriend to learn that scientists have proved that blue flowers represent\r\nthe most highly developed lines of descent. These learned men believe\r\nthat all flowers were at first yellow, being perhaps only developed\r\nstamens; then some became white, others red; while the purple and blue\r\nwere the latest and highest forms. The simplest shaped flowers, open to\r\nbe visited by every insect, are still yellow or white, running into red\r\nor pink. Thus the Rose family have simple open symmetrical flowers; and\r\nthere are no blue Roses--the flower has never risen to the blue stage.\r\nIn the Pea family the simpler flowers are yellow or red; while the\r\nhighly evolved members, such as Lupines, Wistaria, Everlasting Pea, are\r\npurple or blue, varying to white. Bees are among the highest forms of\r\ninsect life, and the labiate flowers are adapted to their visits; these\r\nnearly all have purple or blue petals--Thyme, Sage, Mint, Marjoram,\r\nBasil, Prunella, etc.\r\n\r\nOf course the Blue Border runs into tints of pale lilac and purple and\r\nis thereby the gainer; but I would remove from it the purple Clematis,\r\nWistaria, and Passion-flower, all of which a friend has planted to cover\r\nthe wall behind her blue flower bed. Sometimes the line between blue and\r\npurple is hard to define. Keats invented a word, _purplue_, which he\r\nused for this indeterminate color.\r\n\r\nI would not, in my Blue Border, exclude an occasional group of flowers\r\nof other colors; I love a border of all colors far too well to do that.\r\nHere, as everywhere in my garden, should be white flowers, especially\r\ntall white flowers: white Foxgloves, white Delphinium, white Lupine,\r\nwhite Hollyhock, white Bell-flower, nor should I object to a few spires\r\nat one end of the bed of sulphur-yellow Lupines, or yellow Hollyhocks,\r\nor a group of Paris Daisies. I have seen a great Oriental Poppy growing\r\nin wonderful beauty near a mass of pale blue Larkspur, and Shirley\r\nPoppies are a delight with blues; and any one could arrange the\r\npompadour tints of pink and blue in a garden who could in a gown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scilla.]\r\n\r\nLet me name some of the favorites of the Blue Border. The earliest but\r\nnot the eldest is the pretty spicy Scilla in several varieties, and most\r\nsatisfactory it is in perfection of tint, length of bloom, and great\r\nhardiness. It would be welcomed as we eagerly greet all the early spring\r\nblooms, even if it were not the perfect little blossom that is pictured\r\non page 254, the very little Scilla that grew in my mother's garden.\r\n\r\nThe early spring blooming of the beloved Grape Hyacinth gives us an\r\noverflowing bowl of \"blue principle\"; the whole plant is imbued and\r\nfairly exudes blue. Ruskin gave the beautiful and appropriate term\r\n\"blue-flushing\" to this plant and others, which at the time of their\r\nblossoming send out through their veins their blue color into the\r\nsurrounding leaves and the stem; he says they \"breathe out\" their color,\r\nand tells of a \"saturated purple\" tint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sweet Alyssum Edging.]\r\n\r\nNot content with the confines of the garden border, the Grape Hyacinth\r\nhas \"escaped the garden,\" and become a field flower. The \"seeing eye,\"\r\never quick to feel a difference in shade or color, which often proves\r\nvery slight upon close examination, viewed on Long Island a splendid sea\r\nof blue; and it seemed neither the time nor tint for the expected\r\nViolet. We found it a field of Grape Hyacinth, blue of leaf, of stem, of\r\nflower. While all flowers are in a sense perfect, some certainly do not\r\nappear so in shape, among the latter those of irregular sepals. Some\r\nflowers seem imperfect without any cause save the fancy of the one who\r\nis regarding them; thus to me the Balsam is an imperfect flower. Other\r\nflowers impress me delightfully with a sense of perfection. Such is the\r\nGrape Hyacinth, doubly grateful in this perfection in the time it comes\r\nin early spring. The Grape Hyacinth is the favorite spring flower of my\r\ngarden--but no! I thought a minute ago the Scilla was! and what place\r\nhas the Violet? the Flower de Luce? I cannot decide, but this I know--it\r\nis some blue flower.\r\n\r\nRuskin says of the Grape Hyacinth, as he saw it growing in southern\r\nFrance, its native home, \"It was as if a cluster of grapes and a hive of\r\nhoney had been distilled and pressed together into one small boss of\r\ncelled and beaded blue.\" I always think of his term \"beaded blue\" when I\r\nlook at it. There are several varieties, from a deep blue or purple to\r\nsky-blue, and one is fringed with the most delicate feathery petals.\r\nSome varieties have a faint perfume, and country folk call the flower\r\n\"Baby's Breath\" therefrom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bachelor's Buttons in a Salem Garden.]\r\n\r\nPurely blue, too, are some of our garden Hyacinths, especially a rather\r\nmeagre single Hyacinth which looks a little chilly; and Gavin Douglas\r\nwrote in the springtime of 1500, \"The Flower de Luce forth spread his\r\nheavenly blue.\" It always jars upon my sense of appropriateness to hear\r\nthis old garden favorite called Fleur de Lis. The accepted derivation\r\nof the word is that given by Grandmaison in his _Heraldic Dictionary_.\r\nLouis VII. of France, whose name was then written Loys, first gave the\r\nname to the flower, \"Fleur de Loys\"; then it became Fleur de Louis, and\r\nfinally, Fleur de Lis. Our flower caught its name from Louis. Tusser in\r\nhis list of flowers for windows and pots gave plainly Flower de Luce;\r\nand finally Gerarde called the plant Flower de Luce, and he advised its\r\nuse as a domestic remedy in a manner which is in vogue in country homes\r\nin New England to-day. He said that the root \"stamped plaister-wise,\r\ndoth take away the blewnesse or blacknesse of any stroke\" that is, a\r\nblack and blue bruise. Another use advised of him is as obsolete as the\r\nform in which it was rendered. He said it was \"good in a loch or licking\r\nmedicine for shortness of breath.\" Our apothecaries no longer make, nor\r\ndo our physicians prescribe, \"licking medicines.\" The powdered root was\r\nurged as a complexion beautifier, especially to remove morphew, and as\r\norris-root may be found in many of our modern skin lotions.\r\n\r\nRuskin most beautifully describes the Flower de Luce as the flower of\r\nchivalry--\"with a sword for its leaf, and a Lily for its heart.\" These\r\ngrand clumps of erect old soldiers, with leafy swords of green and\r\nsplendid cuirasses and plumes of gold and bronze and blue, were planted\r\na century ago in our grandmothers' garden, and were then Flower de Luce.\r\nA hundred years those sturdy sentinels have stood guard on either side\r\nof the garden gates--still Flower de Luce. There are the same clean-cut\r\nleaf swords, the same exquisite blossoms, far more beautiful than our\r\ntropical Orchids, though similar in shape; let us not change now their\r\nhistoric name, they still are Flower de Luce--the Flower de Louis.\r\n\r\nThe Violet family, with its Pansies and Ladies' Delights, has honored\r\nplace in our Blue Border, though the rigid color list of a prosaic\r\npractical dyer finds these Violet allies a debased purple instead of\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nOur wild Violets, the blue ones, have for me a sad lack for a Violet,\r\nthat of perfume. They are not as lovely in the woodlands as their\r\nearlier coming neighbor, the shy, pure Hepatica. Bryant, calling the\r\nHepatica Squirrelcups (a name I never heard given them elsewhere), says\r\nthey form \"a graceful company hiding in their bells a soft aerial blue.\"\r\nOf course, they vary through blue and pinky purple, but the blue is well\r\nhidden, and I never think of them save as an almost white flower. Nor\r\nare the Violets as lovely on the meadow and field slopes, as the mild\r\nInnocence, the Houstonia, called also Bluets, which is scarcely a\r\ndistinctly blue expanse, but rather \"a milky way of minute stars.\" An\r\nEnglish botanist denies that it is blue at all. A field covered with\r\nInnocence always looks to me as if little clouds and puffs of blue-white\r\nsmoke had descended and rested on the grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A \"Sweet Garden-side\" in Salem, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nI well recall when the Aquilegia, under the name of California\r\nColumbine, entered my mother's garden, to which its sister, the red and\r\nyellow Columbine, had been brought from a rocky New England pasture when\r\nthe garden was new. This Aquilegia came to us about the year 1870. I\r\npresume old catalogues of American florists would give details and dates\r\nof the journey of the plant from the Pacific to the Atlantic. It chanced\r\nthat this first Aquilegia of my acquaintance was of a distinct light\r\nblue tint; and it grew apace and thrived and was vastly admired, and\r\nfilled the border with blueness of that singular tint seen of late years\r\nin its fullest extent and most prominent position in the great masses of\r\nbloom of the blue Hydrangea, the show plant of such splendid summer\r\nhomes as may be found at Newport. These blue Hydrangeas are ever to me a\r\ncolor blot. They accord with no other flower and no foliage. I am\r\never reminded of blue mould, of stale damp. I looked with inexpressible\r\naversion on a photograph of Cecil Rhodes' garden at Cape Town--several\r\nsolid acres set with this blue Hydrangea and nothing else, unbroken by\r\ntree or shrub, and scarce a path, growing as thick as a field sown with\r\nensilage corn, and then I thought what would be the color of that mass!\r\nthat crop of Hydrangeas! Yet I am told that Rhodes is a flower-lover and\r\nflower-thinker. Now this Aquilegia was of similar tint; it was blue, but\r\nit was not a pleasing blue, and additional plants of pink, lilac, and\r\npurple tints had to be added before the Aquilegia was really included in\r\nour list of well-beloveds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Salpiglossis.]\r\n\r\nThere are other flowers for the blue border. It is pleasant to plant\r\ncommon Flax, if you have ample room; it is a superb blue; to many\r\npersons the blossom is unfamiliar, and is always of interest. Its lovely\r\nflowers have been much sung in English verse. The Salpiglossis, shown on\r\nthe opposite page, is in its azure tint a lovely flower, though it is a\r\nkinsman of the despised Petunia.\r\n\r\nHow the Campanulaceae enriched the beauty and the blueness of the garden.\r\nWe had our splendid clusters of Canterbury Bells, both blue and white. I\r\nhave told elsewhere of our love for them in childhood. Equally dear to\r\nus was a hardy old Campanula whose full name I know not, perhaps it is\r\nthe Pyramidalis; it is shown on page 263, the very plant my mother set\r\nout, still growing and blooming; nothing in the garden is more gladly\r\nwelcomed from year to year. It partakes of the charm shared by every\r\nbell-shaped flower, a simple form, but an ever pleasing one. We had also\r\nthe _Campanula persicifolia_ and _trachelium_, and one we called\r\nBluebells of Scotland, which was not the correct name. It now has died\r\nout, and no one recalls enough of its exact detail to learn its real\r\nname. The showiest bell-flower was the _Platycodon grandiflorum_, the\r\nChinese or Japanese Bell-flower, shown on page 264. Another name is the\r\nBalloon-flower, this on account of the characteristic buds shaped like\r\nan inflated balloon. It is a lovely blue in tint, though this photograph\r\nwas taken from a white-flowered plant in the white border at Indian\r\nHill. The Giant Bell-flower is a _fin de siecle_ blossom named\r\n_Ostrowskia_, with flowers four inches deep and six inches in diameter;\r\nit has not yet become common in our gardens, where the _Platycodon_\r\nrules in size among its bell-shaped fellows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Old Campanula.]\r\n\r\nThere are several pretty low-growing blue flowers suitable for edgings,\r\namong them the tiny stars of the Swan River Daisy (_Brachycome\r\niberidifolia_) sold as purple, but as brightly blue as Scilla. The\r\ndwarf Ageratum is also a long-blossoming soft-tinted blue flower; it\r\nmade a charming edging in my sister's garden last summer; but I should\r\nnever put either of them on the edge of the blue border.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chinese Bell-flower.]\r\n\r\nThe dull blue, sparsely set flowers of the various members of the Mint\r\nfamily have no beauty in color, nor any noticeable elegance; the Blue\r\nSage is the only vivid-hued one, and it is a true ornament to the\r\nborder. Prunella was ever found in old gardens, now it is a wayside\r\nweed. Thoreau loved the Prunella for its blueness, its various lights,\r\nand noted that its color deepened toward night. This flower, regarded\r\nwith indifference by nearly every one, and distaste by many, always to\r\nhim suggested coolness and freshness by its presence. The Prunella was\r\nbeloved also by Ruskin, who called it the soft warm-scented Brunelle,\r\nand told of the fine purple gleam of its hooded blossom: \"the two\r\nuppermost petals joined like an old-fashioned enormous hood or bonnet;\r\nthe lower petal torn deep at the edges into a kind of fringe,\"--and he\r\nsaid it was a \"Brownie flower,\" a little eerie and elusive in its\r\nmeaning. I do not like it because it has such a disorderly, unkempt\r\nlook, it always seems bedraggled.\r\n\r\nThe pretty ladder-like leaf of Jacob's Ladder is most delicate and\r\npleasing in the garden, and its blue bell-flowers are equally refined.\r\nThis is truly an old-fashioned plant, but well worth universal\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the question, What is the bluest flower in the garden or\r\nfield? one answered Fringed Gentian; another the Forget-me-not, which\r\nhas much pink in its buds and yellow in its blossoms; another Bee\r\nLarkspur; and the others _Centaurea cyanus_ or Bachelor's Buttons, a\r\nlocal American name for them, which is not even a standard folk name,\r\nsince there are twenty-one English plants called Bachelor's Buttons.\r\nRagged Sailor is another American name. Corn-flower, Blue-tops, Blue\r\nBonnets, Bluebottles, Loggerheads are old English names. Queerer still\r\nis the title Break-your-spectacles. Hawdods is the oldest name of all.\r\nFitzherbert, in his _Boke of Husbandry_, 1586, thus describes briefly\r\nthe plant:--\r\n\r\n     \"Hawdod hath a blewe floure, and a few lytle leaves, and hath fyve\r\n     or syxe branches floured at the top.\"\r\n\r\nIn varied shades of blue, purple, lilac, pink, and white, Bachelor's\r\nButtons are found in every old garden, growing in a confused tangle of\r\n\"lytle leaves\" and vari-colored flowers, very happily and with very good\r\neffect. The illustration on page 258 shows their growth and value in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nIn _The Promise of May_ Dora's eyes are said to be as blue as the\r\nBluebell, Harebell, Speedwell, Bluebottle, Succory, Forget-me-not, and\r\nViolets; so we know what flowers Tennyson deemed blue.\r\n\r\nAnother poet named as the bluest flower, the Monk's-hood, so wonderful\r\nof color, one of the very rarest of garden tints; graceful of growth,\r\nblooming till frost, and one of the garden's delights. In a list of\r\ngarden flowers published in Boston, in 1828, it is called Cupid's Car.\r\nSouthey says in _The Doctor_, of Miss Allison's garden: \"The Monk's-hood\r\nof stately growth Betsey called 'Dumbledores Delight,' and was not aware\r\nthat the plant, in whose helmet--rather than cowl-shaped flowers, that\r\nbusy and best-natured of all insects appears to revel more than any\r\nother, is the deadly Aconite of which she read in poetry.\" The\r\ndumbledore was the bumblebee, and this folk name was given, as many\r\nothers have been, from a close observance of plant habits; for the\r\nfertilization of the Monk's-hood is accomplished only by the aid of the\r\nbumblebee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden at Tudor Place.]\r\n\r\nMany call Chicory or Succory our bluest flower. Thoreau happily termed\r\nit \"a cool blue.\" It is not often the fortune of a flower to be brought\r\nto notice and affection because of a poem; we expect the poem to\r\ncelebrate the virtues of flowers already loved. The Succory is an\r\nexample of a plant, known certainly to flower students, yet little\r\nthought of by careless observers until the beautiful poem of Margaret\r\nDeland touched all who read it. I think this a gem of modern poesy,\r\nhaving in full that great element of a true poem, the most essential\r\nelement indeed of a short poem--the power of suggestion. Who can read it\r\nwithout being stirred by its tenderness and sentiment, yet how few are\r\nthe words.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, not in ladies' gardens,\r\n       My peasant posy,\r\n     Shine thy dear blue eyes;\r\n     Nor only--nearer to the skies\r\n       In upland pastures, dim and sweet,\r\n     But by the dusty road,\r\n       Where tired feet\r\n     Toil to and fro,\r\n       Where flaunting Sin\r\n     May see thy heavenly hue,\r\n       Or weary Sorrow look from thee\r\n     Toward a tenderer blue.\"\r\n\r\nI recall perfectly every flower I saw in pasture, swamp, forest, or lane\r\nwhen I was a child; and I know I never saw Chicory save in old gardens.\r\nIt has increased and spread wonderfully along the roadside within twenty\r\nyears. By tradition it was first brought to us from England by Governor\r\nBowdoin more than a century ago, to plant as forage.\r\n\r\nIn our common Larkspur, the old-fashioned garden found its most constant\r\nand reliable blue banner, its most valuable color giver. Self-sown,\r\nthis Larkspur sprung up freely every year; needing no special cherishing\r\nor nourishing, it grew apace, and bloomed with a luxuriance and length\r\nof flowering that cheerfully blued the garden for the whole summer. It\r\nwas a favorite of children in their floral games, and pretty in the\r\nhousewife's vases, but its chief hold on favor was in its democracy and\r\nendurance. Other flowers drew admirers and lost them; some grew very\r\nugly in their decay; certain choice seedlings often had stunted\r\ndevelopment, garden scourges attacked tender beauties; fierce July suns\r\ndried up the whole border, all save the Larkspur, which neither withered\r\nnor decayed; and often, unaided, saved the midsummer garden from scanty\r\nunkemptness and dire disrepute.\r\n\r\nThe graceful line of Dr. Holmes, \"light as a loop of Larkspur,\" always\r\ncomes to my mind as I look at a bed of Larkspur; and I am glad to show\r\nhere a \"loop of Larkspur,\" growing by the great boulder which he loved\r\nin the grounds of his country home at Beverly Farms. I liked to fancy\r\nthat Dr. Holmes's expression was written by him from his memory of the\r\nlittle wreaths and garlands of pressed Larkspur that have been made so\r\nuniversally for over a century by New England children. But that careful\r\nflower observer, Mrs. Wright, notes that in a profuse growth of the Bee\r\nLarkspur, the strong flower spikes often are in complete loops before\r\nfull expansion into a straight spire; some are looped thrice. Dr. Holmes\r\nwas a minute observer of floral characteristics, as is shown in his poem\r\non the _Coming of Spring_, and doubtless saw this curious growth of the\r\nLarkspur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Light as a Loop of Larkspur.\"]\r\n\r\nCommon annual Larkspurs now are planted in every one's garden, and\r\ndeservedly grow in favor yearly. The season of their flowering can be\r\nprolonged, renewed in fact, by cutting away the withered flower stems.\r\nThey respond well to all caretaking, to liberal fertilizing and\r\nwatering, just as they dwindle miserably with neglect. There are a\r\nhundred varieties in all; among them the \"Rocket-flowered\" and\r\n\"Ranunculus flowered\" Larkspurs or Delphiniums are ever favorites. A\r\nfriend burst forth in railing at being asked to admire a bed of\r\nDelphinium. \"Why can't she call them the good old-time name of Larkspur,\r\nand not a stiff name cooked up by the botanists.\" I answered naught, but\r\nI remembered that Parkinson in his _Garden of Pleasant Flowers_ gives a\r\nchapter to Delphinium, with Lark's-heel as a second thought. \"Their most\r\nusual name with us,\" he states, \"is Delphinium.\" There is meaning in the\r\nname: the flower is dolphin-like in shape. Of the perennial varieties\r\nthe _Delphinium brunonianum_ has lovely clear blue, musk-scented\r\nflowers; the Chinese or Branching Larkspur is of varied blue tints and\r\ntall growth, and blooms from midsummer until frost. And loveliest of\r\nall, an old garden favorite, the purely blue Bee Larkspur, with a bee in\r\nthe heart of each blossom. In an ancient garden in Deerfield I saw this\r\nyear a splendid group of plants of the old _Delphinium Belladonna_: it\r\nis a weak-kneed, weak-backed thing; but give it unobtrusive crutches and\r\nbusks and backboards (in their garden equivalents), and its incomparable\r\nblue will reward your care. There is something singular in the blue of\r\nLarkspur. Even on a dark night you can see it showing a distinct blue\r\nin the garden like a blue lambent flame.\r\n\r\n    \"Larkspur lifting turquoise spires\r\n     Bluer than the sorcerer's fires.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Milne-Home says her old Scotch gardener called the white Delphinium\r\nElijah's Chariot--a resounding, stately title. Helmet-flower is another\r\nname. I think the Larkspur Border, and the Blue Border both gain if a\r\nfew plants of the pure white Delphinium, especially the variety called\r\nthe Emperor, bloom by the blue flowers. In our garden the common blue\r\nLarkspur loves to blossom by the side of the white Phlox. A bit of the\r\nborder is shown on page 162. In another corner of the garden the pink\r\nand lilac Larkspur should be grown; for their tints, running into blue,\r\nare as varied as those of an opal.\r\n\r\nI have never seen the wild Larkspur which grows so plentifully in our\r\nmiddle Southern states; but I have seen expanses of our common garden\r\nLarkspur which has run wild. Nor have I seen the glorious fields of\r\nWyoming Larkspur, so poisonous to cattle; nor the magnificent Larkspur,\r\neight feet high, described so radiantly to us by John Muir, which blues\r\nthose wonders of nature, the hanging meadow gardens of California.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that Lobelia is the least pleasing blue flower\r\nthat blossoms. I never see it in any place or juxtaposition that it\r\nsatisfies me. When you take a single flower of it in your hand, its\r\nsingle little delicate bloom is really just as pretty as Blue-eyed\r\nGrass, or Innocence, or Scilla, and the whole plant regarded closely by\r\nitself isn't at all bad; but whenever and wherever you find it growing\r\nin a garden, you never want it in _that_ place, and you shift it here\r\nand there. I am convinced that the Lobelia is simply impossible; it is\r\nan alien, wrong in some subtle way in tint, in habit of growth, in time\r\nof blooming. The last time I noted it in any large garden planting, it\r\nwas set around the roots of some standard Rose bushes; and the gardener\r\nhad displayed some thought about it; it was only at the base of white or\r\ncream-yellow Roses; but it still was objectionable. I think I would\r\nexterminate Lobelia if I could, banish it and forget it. In the minds of\r\nmany would linger a memory of certain ornate garden vases, each crowded\r\nwith a Pandanus-y plant, a pink Begonia, a scarlet double Geranium, a\r\npurple Verbena or a crimson Petunia, all gracefully entwined with\r\nNasturtiums and Lobelia--while these folks lived, the Lobelia would not\r\nbe forgotten.\r\n\r\nYou will have some curious experiences with your Blue Border; kindly\r\nfriends, pleased with its beauty or novelty, will send to you plants and\r\nseeds to add to its variety of form \"another bright blue flower.\" You\r\nwill usually find you have added variety of tint as well, ranging into\r\ncrimson and deep purple, for color blindness is far more general than is\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nThe loveliest blue flowers are the wild ones of fields and meadows;\r\ntherefore the poor, says Alphonse Karr, with these and the blue of the\r\nsky have the best and the most of all blueness. Yet we are constantly\r\nhearing folks speak of the lack of the color blue among wild flowers,\r\nwhich always surprises me; I suppose I see blue because I love blue. In\r\npure cobalt tint it is rare; in compensation, when it does abound, it\r\nmakes a permanent imprint on our vision, which never vanishes. Recalling\r\nin midwinter the expanses of color in summer waysides, I do not see them\r\nwhite with Daisies, or yellow with Goldenrod, but they are in my mind's\r\nvision brightly, beautifully blue. One special scene is the blue of\r\nFringed Gentians, on a sunny October day, on a rocky hill road in\r\nRoyalston, Massachusetts, where they sprung up, wide open, a solid mass\r\nof blue, from stone wall to stone wall, with scarcely a wheel rut\r\nshowing among them. Even thus, growing in as lavish abundance as any\r\nweed, the Fringed Gentian still preserved in collective expanse, its\r\ndelicate, its distinctly aristocratic bearing.\r\n\r\nBryant asserts of this flower:--\r\n\r\n    \"Thou waitest late, and com'st alone\r\n     When woods are bare, and birds are flown.\"\r\n\r\nBut by this roadside the woods were far from bare. Many Asters,\r\nespecially the variety I call Michaelmas Daisies, Goldenrod,\r\nButter-and-eggs, Turtle Head, and other flowers, were in ample bloom.\r\nAnd the same conditions of varied flower companionship existed when I\r\nsaw the Fringed Gentian blooming near Bryant's own home at Cummington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Viper's Bugloss.]\r\n\r\nAnother vast field of blue, ever living in my memory, was that of the\r\nViper's Bugloss, which I viewed with surprise and delight from the\r\nplatform of a train, returning from the Columbian Exposition; when I\r\nasked a friendly brakeman what the flower was called, he answered\r\n\"Vilets,\" as nearly all workingmen confidently name every blue flower;\r\nand he sprang from the train while the locomotive was swallowing water,\r\nand brought to me a great armful of blueness. I am not wont to like new\r\nflowers as well as my childhood's friends, but I found this new friend,\r\nthe Viper's Bugloss, a very welcome and pleasing acquaintance. Curious,\r\ntoo, it is, with the red anthers exserted beyond the bright blue\r\ncorolla, giving the field, when the wind blew across it, a new aspect\r\nand tint, something like a red and blue changeable silk. The Viper's\r\nBugloss seems to have the pervasive power of many another blue and\r\npurple flower, Lupine, Iris, Innocence, Grape Hyacinth, Vervain, Aster,\r\nSpiked Loosestrife; it has become in many states a tiresome weed. On the\r\nEsopus Creek (which runs into the Hudson River) and adown the Hudson,\r\nacre after acre of meadow and field by the waterside are vivid with its\r\nchangeable hues, and the New York farmers' fields are overrun by the\r\nnewcomer.\r\n\r\nI have seen the Viper's Bugloss often since that day on the railroad\r\ntrain, now that I know it, and think of it. Thoreau noted the fact that\r\nin a large sense we find only what we look for. And he defined well our\r\npowers of perception when he said that many an object will not be seen,\r\neven when it comes within the range of our visual ray, because it does\r\nnot come within the range of our intellectual ray.\r\n\r\nLast spring, having to spend a tiresome day riding the length of Long\r\nIsland, I beguiled the hours by taking with me Thoreau's _Summer_ to\r\ncompare his notes of blossomings with those we passed. It was June 5,\r\nand I read:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Lupine is now in its glory. It is the more important because\r\n     it occurs in such extensive patches, even an acre or more\r\n     together.... It paints a whole hillside with its blue, making such\r\n     a field, if not a meadow, as Proserpine might have wandered in. Its\r\n     leaf was made to be covered with dewdrops. I am quite excited by\r\n     this prospect of blue flowers in clumps, with narrow intervals;\r\n     such a profusion of the heavenly, the Elysian color, as if these\r\n     were the Elysian Fields. That is the value of the Lupine. The earth\r\n     is blued with it.... You may have passed here a fortnight ago and\r\n     the field was comparatively barren. Now you come, and these\r\n     glorious redeemers appear to have flashed out here all at once. Who\r\n     plants the seeds of Lupines in the barren soil? Who watereth the\r\n     Lupines in the field?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Precision of Leaf and Flower of Lupine.]\r\n\r\nI looked from a car window, and lo! the Long Island Railroad ran also\r\nthrough an Elysian Field of Lupines, nay, we sailed a swift course\r\nthrough a summer sea of blueness, and I seem to see it still, with its\r\nprim precision of outline and growth of both leaf and flower. The Lupine\r\nis beautiful in the garden border as it is in the landscape, whether the\r\nblossom be blue, yellow, or white.\r\n\r\nThoreau was the slave of color, but he was the master of its\r\ndescription. He was as sensitive as Keats to the charm of blue, and left\r\nmany records of his love, such as the paragraphs above quoted. He noted\r\nwith delight the abundance of \"that principle which gives the air its\r\nazure color, which makes the distant hills and meadows appear blue,\" the\r\n\"great blue presence\" of Monadnock and Wachusett with its \"far blue\r\neye.\" He loved Lowell's\r\n\r\n      \"Sweet atmosphere of hazy blue,\r\n    So leisurely, so soothing, so forgiving,\r\n    That sometimes makes New England fit for living.\"\r\n\r\nHe revelled in the blue tints of water, of snow, of ice; in \"the\r\nblueness and softness of a mild winter day.\" The constant blueness of\r\nthe sky at night thrilled him with \"an everlasting surprise,\" as did the\r\nblue shadows within the woods and the blueness of distant woods. How he\r\nwould have rejoiced in Monet's paintings, how true he would have found\r\ntheir tones. He even idealized blueberries, \"a very innocent ambrosial\r\ntaste, as if made of ether itself, as they are colored with it.\"\r\n\r\nThoreau was ever ready in thought of Proserpina gathering flowers. He\r\noffers to her the Lupine, the Blue-eyed Grass, and the Tufted Vetch,\r\n\"blue, inclining in spots to purple\"; it affected him deeply to see such\r\nan abundance of blueness in the grass. \"Celestial color, I see it afar\r\nin masses on the hillside near the meadow--so much blue.\"\r\n\r\nI usually join with Thoreau in his flower loves; but I cannot understand\r\nhis feeling toward the blue Flag; that, after noting the rich fringed\r\nrecurved parasols over its anthers, and its exquisite petals, that he\r\ncould say it is \"a little too showy and gaudy, like some women's\r\nbonnets.\" I note that whenever he compares flowers to women it is in no\r\nflattering humor to either; which is, perhaps, what we expect from a man\r\nwho chose to be a bachelor and a hermit. His love of obscure and small\r\nflowers might explain his sentiment toward the radiant and dominant blue\r\nFlag.\r\n\r\nThe most valued flower of my childhood, outside the garden, was a little\r\nsister of the Iris--the Blue-eyed Grass. To find it blooming was a\r\ntriumph, for it was not very profuse of growth near my home; to gather\r\nit a delight; why, I know not, since the tiny blooms promptly closed and\r\nwithered as soon as we held them in our warm little hands. Colonel\r\nHigginson writes wittily of the Blue-eyed Grass, \"It has such an\r\nannoying way of shutting up its azure orbs the moment you gather it; and\r\nyou reach home with a bare stiff blade which deserves no better name\r\nthan _Sisyrinchium anceps_.\"\r\n\r\nThe only time I ever played truant was to run off one June morning to\r\nfind \"the starlike gleam amid the grass and dew\"; to pick Blue-eyed\r\nGrass in a field to which I was conducted by another naughty girl. I was\r\nsimple enough to come home at mid-day with my hands full of the stiff\r\nblades and tightly closed blooms; and at my mother's inquiry as to my\r\nacquisition of these treasures, I promptly burst into tears. I was then\r\ntold, in impressive phraseology adapted to my youthful comprehension,\r\nand with the flowers as eloquent proof, that all stolen pleasures were\r\never like my coveted flowers, withered and unsightly as soon as\r\ngathered--which my mother believed was true.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms of this little Iris seem to lie on the surface of the grass\r\nlike a froth of blueness; they gaze up at the sky with a sort of\r\nintimacy as if they were a part of it. Thoreau called it an \"air of easy\r\nsympathy.\" The slightest clouding or grayness of atmosphere makes them\r\nturn away and close.\r\n\r\nThe naming of Proserpina leads me to say this: that to grow in love and\r\nknowledge of flowers, and above all of blue flowers, you must read\r\nRuskin's _Proserpina_. It is a book of botany, of studies of plants, but\r\nbegemmed with beautiful sentences and thoughts and expressions, with\r\nlessons of pleasantness which you can never forget, of pictures which\r\nyou never cease to see, such sentences and pictures as this:--\r\n\r\n     \"Rome. My father's Birthday. I found the loveliest blue Asphodel I\r\n     ever saw in my life in the fields beyond Monte Mario--a spire two\r\n     feet high, of more than two hundred stars, the stalks of them all\r\n     deep blue as well as the flowers. Heaven send all honest people the\r\n     gathering of the like, in the Elysian Fields, some day!\"\r\n\r\nOh, the power of written words! when by these few lines I can carry\r\nforever in my inner vision this spire of starry blueness. To that\r\nwriter, now in the Elysian Fields, an honest teacher if ever one lived,\r\nI send my thanks for this beautiful vision of blueness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPLANT NAMES\r\n\r\n     \"The fascination of plant names is founded on two instincts,--love\r\n     of Nature and curiosity about Language.\"\r\n\r\n     --_English Plant Names_, REV. JOHN EARLE, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerbal magic is the subtle mysterious power of certain words. This power\r\nmay come from association with the senses; thus I have distinct sense of\r\nstimulation in the word scarlet, and pleasure in the words lucid and\r\nliquid. The word garden is a never ceasing delight; it seems to me\r\nOriental; perhaps I have a transmitted sense from my grandmother Eve of\r\nthe Garden of Eden. I like the words, a Garden of Olives, a Garden of\r\nHerbs, the Garden of the Gods, a Garden enclosed, Philosophers of the\r\nGarden, the Garden of the Lord. As I have written on gardens, and\r\nthought on gardens, and walked in gardens, \"the very music of the name\r\nhas gone into my being.\" How beautiful are Cardinal Newman's words:--\r\n\r\n     \"By a garden is meant mystically a place of spiritual repose,\r\n     stillness, peace, refreshment, delight.\"\r\n\r\nThere was, in Gerarde's day, no fixed botanical nomenclature of any of\r\nthe parts or attributes of a plant. Without using botanical terms, try\r\nto describe a plant so as to give an exact notion of it to a person who\r\nhas never seen it, then try to find common words to describe hundreds of\r\nplants; you will then admire the vocabulary of the old herbalist, his\r\n\"fresh English words,\" for you will find that it needs the most dextrous\r\nuse of words to convey accurately the figure of a flower. That felicity\r\nand facility Gerarde had; \"a bleak white color\"--how clearly you see it!\r\nThe Water Lily had \"great round leaves like a buckler.\" The Cat-tail\r\nFlags \"flower and bear their mace or torch in July and August.\" One\r\nplant had \"deeply gashed leaves.\" The Marigold had \"fat thick crumpled\r\nleaves set upon a gross and spongious stalke.\" Here is the Wake-robin,\r\n\"a long hood in proportion like the ear of a hare, in middle of which\r\nhood cometh forth a pestle or clapper of a dark murry or pale purple\r\ncolor.\" The leaves of the Corn-marigold are \"much hackt and cut into\r\ndivers sections and placed confusedly.\" Another plant had leaves of \"an\r\noverworne green,\" and Pansy leaves were \"a bleak green.\" The leaves of\r\nTansy are also vividly described as \"infinitely jagged and nicked and\r\ncurled with all like unto a plume of feathers.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Garden's Friend.]\r\n\r\nThe classification and naming of flowers was much thought and written\r\nupon from Gerarde's day, until the great work of Linnaeus was finished.\r\nSome very original schemes were devised. _The Curious and Profitable\r\nGardner_, printed in 1730, suggested this plan: That all plants should\r\nbe named to indicate their color, and that the initials of their names\r\nshould be the initials of their respective colors; thus if a plant were\r\nnamed William the Conqueror it would indicate that the name was of a\r\nwhite flower with crimson lines or shades. \"Virtuous Oreada would\r\nindicate a violet and orange flower; Charming Phyllis or Curious\r\nPlotinus a crimson and purple blossom.\" S. was to indicate Black or\r\nSable, and what letter was Scarlet to have? The \"curious ingenious\r\nGentleman\" who published this plan urged also the giving of \"pompous\r\nnames\" as more dignified; and he made the assertion that French and\r\nFlemish \"Flowerists\" had adopted his system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edging of Striped Lilies in a Salem Garden.]\r\n\r\nThese were all forerunners of Ruskin, with his poetical notions of plant\r\nnomenclature, such as this; that feminine forms of names ending in _a_\r\n(as Prunella, Campanula, Salvia, Kalmia) and _is_ (Iris, Amarylis)\r\nshould be given only to plants \"that are pretty and good\"; and that real\r\nnames, Lucia, Clarissa, etc., be also given. Masculine names in _us_\r\nshould be given to plants of masculine qualities,--strength, force,\r\nstubbornness; neuter endings in _um_, given to plants indicative of evil\r\nor death.\r\n\r\nI have a fancy anent many old-time flower names that they are also the\r\nnames of persons. I think of them as persons bearing various traits and\r\ncharacteristics. On the other hand, many old English Christian names\r\nseem so suited for flowers, that they might as well stand for flowers as\r\nfor persons. Here are a few of these quaint old names, Collet, Colin,\r\nEmmot, Issot, Doucet, Dobinet, Cicely, Audrey, Amice, Hilary, Bryde,\r\nMorrice, Tyffany, Amery, Nowell, Ellice, Digory, Avery, Audley, Jacomin,\r\nGillian, Petronille, Gresel, Joyce, Lettice, Cibell, Avice, Cesselot,\r\nParnell, Renelsha. Do they not \"smell sweet to the ear\"? The names of\r\nflowers are often given as Christian names. Children have been\r\nchristened by the names Dahlia, Clover, Hyacinth, Asphodel, Verbena,\r\nMignonette, Pansy, Heartsease, Daisy, Zinnia, Fraxinella, Poppy,\r\nDaffodil, Hawthorn.\r\n\r\nWhat power have the old English names of garden flowers, to unlock old\r\nmemories, as have the flowers themselves! Dr. Earle writes, \"The\r\nfascination of plant names is founded on two instincts; love of Nature,\r\nand curiosity about Language.\" To these I should add an equally strong\r\ninstinct in many persons--their sensitiveness to associations.\r\n\r\nI am never more filled with a sense of the delight of old English\r\nplant-names than when I read the liquid verse of Spenser:--\r\n\r\n    \"Bring hether the pincke and purple Cullembine\r\n            ... with Gellifloures,\r\n     Bring hether Coronations and Sops-in-wine\r\n            Worne of paramours.\r\n     Sow me the ground with Daffadowndillies\r\n     And Cowslips and Kingcups and loved Lilies,\r\n            The pretty Pawnce\r\n            The Chevisaunce\r\n     Shall match with the fayre Flour Delice.\"\r\n\r\nWhy, the names are a pleasure, though you know not what the Sops-in-wine\r\nor the Chevisaunce were. Gilliflowers were in the verses of every poet.\r\nOne of scant fame, named Plat, thus sings:--\r\n\r\n    \"Here spring the goodly Gelofors,\r\n       Some white, some red in showe;\r\n     Here pretie Pinks with jagged leaves\r\n       On rugged rootes do growe;\r\n     The Johns so sweete in showe and smell,\r\n       Distinct by colours twaine,\r\n     About the borders of their beds\r\n       In seemlie sight remaine.\"\r\n\r\nIf there ever existed any difference between Sweet-johns and\r\nSweet-williams, it is forgotten now. They have not shared a revival of\r\npopularity with other old-time favorites. They were one of the \"garland\r\nflowers\" of Gerarde's day, and were \"esteemed for beauty, to deck up the\r\nbosoms of the beautiful, and for garlands and crowns of pleasure.\" In\r\nthe gardens of Hampton Court in the days of King Henry VIII., were\r\nSweet-williams, for the plants had been bought by the bushel.\r\nSweet-williams are little sung by the poets, and I never knew any one\r\nto call the Sweet-william her favorite flower, save one person. Old\r\nresidents of Worcester will recall the tiny cottage that stood on the\r\ncorner of Chestnut and Pleasant streets, since the remote years when the\r\nlatter-named street was a post-road. It was occupied during my childhood\r\nby friends of my mother--a century-old mother, and her ancient unmarried\r\ndaughter. Behind the house stretched one of the most cheerful gardens I\r\nhave ever seen; ever, in my memory, bathed in glowing sunlight and\r\ncolor. Of its glories I recall specially the long spires of vivid Bee\r\nLarkspur, the varied Poppies of wonderful growth, and the rioting\r\nSweet-williams. The latter flowers had some sentimental association to\r\nthe older lady, who always asserted with emphasis to all visitors that\r\nthey were her favorite flower. They overran the entire garden, crowding\r\nthe grass plot where the washed garments were hung out to dry, even\r\ngrowing in the chinks of the stone steps and between the flat stone\r\nflagging of the little back yard, where stood the old well with its\r\nmoss-covered bucket. They spread under the high board fence and appeared\r\noutside on Chestnut Street; and they extended under the dense Lilac\r\nbushes and Cedars and down the steep grass bank and narrow steps to\r\nPleasant Street. The seed was carefully gathered, especially of one\r\nglowing crimson beauty, the color of the Mullein Pink, and a gift of it\r\nwas highly esteemed by other garden owners. Old herbals say the\r\nSweet-williams are \"worthy the Respect of the Greatest Ladies who are\r\nLovers of Flowers.\" They certainly had the respect and love of these\r\ntwo old ladies, who were truly Lovers of Flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden Seat at Avonwood Court.]\r\n\r\nI recall an objection made to Sweet-williams, by some one years ago,\r\nthat they were of no use or value save in the garden; that they could\r\nnever be combined in bouquets, nor did they arrange well in vases. It is\r\na place of honor, some of us believe, to be a garden flower as well as a\r\nvase flower. This garden was the only one I knew when a child which\r\ncontained plants of Love-lies-bleeding--it had even then been deemed\r\nold-fashioned and out of date. And it also held a few Sunflowers, which\r\nhad not then had a revival of attention, and seemed as obsolete as the\r\nLove-lies-bleeding. The last-named flower I always disliked, a\r\nshapeless, gawky creature, described in florists' catalogues and like\r\npublications as \"an effective plant easily attaining to a splendid form\r\nbearing many plume-tufts of rich lustrous crimson.\" It is the \"immortal\r\namarant\" chosen by Milton to crown the celestial beings in _Paradise\r\nLost_. Poor angels! they have had many trying vagaries of attire\r\nassigned to them.\r\n\r\nI can contribute to plant lore one fantastic notion in regard to\r\nLove-lies-bleeding--though I can find no one who can confirm this memory\r\nof my childhood. I recall distinctly expressions of surprise and regret\r\nthat these two old people in Worcester should retain the\r\nLove-lies-bleeding in their garden, because \"the house would surely be\r\nstruck with lightning.\" Perhaps this fancy contributed to the exile of\r\nthe flower from gardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Terraced Garden of the Misses Nichols, Salem,\r\nMassachusetts.]\r\n\r\nThere be those who write, and I suppose they believe, that a love of\r\nNature and perception of her beauties and a knowledge of flowers, are\r\nthe dower of those who are country born and bred; by which is meant\r\nreared upon a farm. I have not found this true. Farm children have\r\nlittle love for Nature and are surprisingly ignorant about wild flowers,\r\nsave a very few varieties. The child who is garden bred has a happier\r\nstart in life, a greater love and knowledge of Nature. It is a principle\r\nof Froebel that one must limit a child's view in order to coordinate his\r\nperceptions. That is precisely what is done in a child's regard of\r\nNature by his life in a garden; his view is limited and he learns to\r\nknow garden flowers and birds and insects thoroughly, when the vast and\r\nbewildering variety of field and forest would have remained\r\nunappreciated by him.\r\n\r\nIt is a distressing condition of the education of farmers, that they\r\nknow so little about the country. The man knows about his crops and his\r\nwife about the flowers, herbs, and vegetables of her garden; but no\r\ncountrymen know the names of wild flowers--and few countrywomen, save of\r\nmedicinal herbs. I asked one farmer the name of a brilliant autumnal\r\nflower whose intense purple was then unfamiliar to me--the Devil's-bit.\r\nHe answered, \"Them's Woilets.\" Violet is the only word in which the\r\ninitial V is ever changed to W by native New Englanders. Every pink or\r\ncrimson flower is a Pink. Spring blossoms are \"Mayflowers.\" A frequent\r\nanswer is, \"Those ain't flowers, they're weeds.\" They are more knowing\r\nas to trees, though shaky about the evergreen trees, having little idea\r\nof varieties and inclined to call many Spruce. They know little about\r\nthe reasons for names of localities, or of any historical traditions\r\nsave those of the Revolution. One exclaims in despair, \"No one in the\r\ncountry knows anything about the country.\"\r\n\r\nThis is no recent indifference and ignorance; Susan Cooper wrote in her\r\n_Rural Hours_ in 1848:--\r\n\r\n     \"When we first made acquaintance with the flowers of the\r\n     neighborhood we asked grown persons--learned perhaps in many\r\n     matters--the common names of plants they must have seen all their\r\n     lives, and we found they were no wiser than the children or\r\n     ourselves. It is really surprising how little country people know\r\n     on such subjects. Farmers and their wives can tell you nothing on\r\n     these matters. The men are at fault even among the trees on their\r\n     own farms, if they are at all out of the common way; and as for\r\n     smaller native plants, they know less about them than Buck or\r\n     Brindle, their own oxen.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kitchen Dooryard at Wilbour Farm, Kingston, Rhode\r\nIsland.]\r\n\r\nIn that delightful book, _The Rescue of an Old Place_, the author has a\r\nchapter on the love of flowers in America. It was written anent the\r\neverpresent statements seen in metropolitan print that Americans do not\r\nlove flowers because they are used among the rich and fashionable in\r\nlarge cities for extravagant display rather than for enjoyment; and that\r\nwe accept botanical names for our indigenous plants instead of calling\r\nthem by homely ones such as familiar flowers are known by in older\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nTwo more foolish claims could scarcely be made. In the first place, the\r\ndoings of fashionable folk in large cities are fortunately far from\r\nbeing a national index or habit. Secondly, in ancient lands the people\r\nnamed the flowers long before there were botanists, here the botanists\r\nfound the flowers and named them for the people. Moreover, country folk\r\nin New England and even in the far West call flowers by pretty\r\nfolk-names, if they call them at all, just as in Old England.\r\n\r\nThe fussing over the use of the scientific Latin names for plants\r\napparently will never cease; many of these Latin names are very\r\npleasant, have become so from constant usage, and scarcely seem Latin;\r\nthus Clematis, Tiarella, Rhodora, Arethusa, Campanula, Potentilla,\r\nHepatica. When I know the folk-names of flowers I always speak thus of\r\nthem--and _to them_; but I am grateful too for the scientific\r\nclassification and naming, as a means of accurate distinction. For any\r\nflower student quickly learns that the same English folk-name is given\r\nin different localities to very different plants. For instance, the name\r\nWhiteweed is applied to ten different plants; there are in England ten\r\nor twelve Cuckoo-flowers, and twenty-one Bachelor's Buttons. Such names\r\nas Mayflower, Wild Pink, Wild Lily, Eyebright, Toad-flax, Ragged Robin,\r\nNone-so-pretty, Lady's-fingers, Four-o'clocks, Redweed, Buttercups,\r\nButterflower, Cat's-tail, Rocket, Blue-Caps, Creeping-jenny, Bird's-eye,\r\nBluebells, apply to half a dozen plants.\r\n\r\nThe old folk-names are not definite, but they are delightful; they tell\r\nof mythology and medicine, of superstitions and traditions; they show\r\ntrains of relationship, and associations; in fact, they appeal more to\r\nthe philologist and antiquarian than to the botanist. Among all the\r\nlanguages which contribute to the variety and picturesqueness of English\r\nplant names, Dr. Prior deems Maple the only one surviving from the\r\nCeltic language. Gromwell and Wormwood may possibly be added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"A running ribbon of perfumed snow which the sun is\r\nmelting rapidly.\"]\r\n\r\nThere are some Anglo-Saxon words; among them Hawthorn and Groundsel.\r\nFrench, Dutch, and Danish names are many, Arabic and Persian are more.\r\nMany plant names are dedicatory; they embody the names of the saints and\r\na few the names of the Deity. Our Lady's Flowers are many and\r\ninteresting; my daughter wrote a series of articles for the _New York\r\nEvening Post_ on Our Lady's Flowers, and the list swelled to a\r\nsurprising number. The devil and witches have their shares of flowers,\r\nas have the fairies.\r\n\r\nI have always regretted deeply that our botanists neglected an\r\nopportunity of great enrichment in plant nomenclature when they ignored\r\nthe Indian names of our native plants, shrubs, and trees. The first\r\nnames given these plants were not always planned by botanists; they were\r\nmore often invented in loving memory of English plants, or sometimes\r\nfrom a fancied resemblance to those plants. They did give the\r\nwonderfully descriptive name of Moccasin-flower to that creature of the\r\nwild-woods; and a far more appropriate title it is than Lady's-slipper,\r\nbut it is not as well known. I have never found the Lady's-slipper as\r\nbeautiful a flower as do nearly all my friends, as did my father and\r\nmother, and I was pleased at Ruskin's sharp comment that such a slipper\r\nwas only fit for very gouty old toes.\r\n\r\nPappoose-root utilizes another Indian word. Very few Indian plant names\r\nwere adopted by the white men, fewer still have been adopted by the\r\nscientists. The _Catalpa speciosa_ (Catalpa); the _Zea mays_ (Maize);\r\nand _Yucca filamentosa_ (Yucca), are the only ones I know. Chinkapin,\r\nCohosh, Hackmatack, Kinnikinnik, Tamarack, Persimmon, Tupelo, Squash,\r\nPuccoon, Pipsissewa, Musquash, Pecan, the Scuppernong and Catawba\r\ngrapes, are our only well-known Indian plant names that survive. Of\r\nthese Maize, the distinctive product of the United States, will ever\r\nlink us with the vanishing Indian. It will be noticed that only Puccoon,\r\nCohosh, Pipsissewa, Hackmatack, and Yucca are names of flowering plants;\r\nof these Yucca is the only one generally known. I am glad our stately\r\nnative trees, Tupelo, Hickory, Catalpa, bear Indian names.\r\n\r\nA curious example of persistence, when so much else has perished, is\r\nfound in the word \"Kiskatomas,\" the shellbark nut. This Algonquin word\r\nwas heard everywhere in the state of New York sixty years ago, and is\r\nnot yet obsolete in families of Dutch descent who still care for the nut\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWe could very well have preserved many Indian names, among them\r\nHiawatha's\r\n\r\n    \"Beauty of the springtime,\r\n     The Miskodeed in blossom,\"\r\n\r\nI think Miskodeed a better name than Claytonia or Spring Beauty. The\r\nOnondaga Indians had a suggestive name for the Marsh Marigold,\r\n\"It-opens-the-swamps,\" which seems to show you the yellow stars \"shining\r\nin swamps and hollows gray.\" The name Cowslip has been transferred to it\r\nin some localities in New England, which is not strange when we find\r\nthat the flower has fifty-six English folk-names; among them are\r\nDrunkards, Crazy Bet, Meadow-bright, Publicans and Sinners, Soldiers'\r\nButtons, Gowans, Kingcups, and Buttercups. Our Italian street venders\r\ncall them Buttercups. In erudite Boston, in sight of Boston Common, the\r\nbeautiful Fringed Gentian is not only called, but labelled, French\r\nGentian. To hear a lovely bunch of the Arethusa called Swamp Pink is not\r\nso strange. The Sabbatia grows in its greatest profusion in the vicinity\r\nof Plymouth, Massachusetts, and is called locally, \"The Rose of\r\nPlymouth.\" It is sold during its season of bloom in the streets of that\r\ntown and is used to dress the churches. Its name was given to honor an\r\nearly botanist, Tiberatus Sabbatia, but in Plymouth there is an almost\r\nuniversal belief that it was named because the Pilgrims of 1620 first\r\nsaw the flower on the Sabbath day. It thus is regarded as a religious\r\nemblem, and strong objection is made to mingling other flowers with it\r\nin church decoration. This legend was invented about thirty years ago by\r\na man whose name is still remembered as well as his work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fountain Garden at Sylvester Manor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTUSSY-MUSSIES\r\n\r\n     \"There be some flowers make a delicious Tussie-Mussie or Nosegay\r\n     both for Sight and Smell.\"\r\n\r\n     --JOHN PARKINSON, _A Garden of all Sorts of Pleasant Flowers_, 1629.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo following can be more productive of a study and love of word\r\nderivations and allied word meanings than gardening. An interest in\r\nflowers and in our English tongue go hand in hand. The old mediaeval word\r\nat the head of this chapter has a full explanation by Nares as \"A\r\nnosegay, a tuzzie-muzzie, a sweet posie.\" The old English form,\r\n_tussy-mose_ was allied with _tosty_, a bouquet, _tuss_ and _tusk_, a\r\nwisp, as of hay, _tussock_, and _tutty_, a nosegay. Thomas Campion\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"Joan can call by name her cows,\r\n     And deck her windows with green boughs;\r\n     She can wreathes and tuttyes make,\r\n     And trim with plums a bridal cake.\"\r\n\r\nTussy-mussy was not a colloquial word; it was found in serious, even in\r\nreligious, text. A tussy-mussy was the most beloved of nosegays, and was\r\noften made of flowers mingled with sweet-scented leaves.\r\n\r\nMy favorite tussy-mussy, if made of flowers, would be of Wood Violet,\r\nCabbage Rose, and Clove Pink. These are all beautiful flowers, but many\r\nof our most delightful fragrances do not come from flowers of gay dress;\r\neven these three are not showy flowers; flowers of bold color and growth\r\nare not apt to be sweet-scented; and all flower perfumes of great\r\ndistinction, all that are unique, are from blossoms of modest color and\r\nbearing. The Calycanthus, called Virginia Allspice, Sweet Shrub, or\r\nStrawberry bush, has what I term a perfume of distinction, and its\r\nflowers are neither fine in shape, color, nor quality.\r\n\r\nI have often tried to define to myself the scent of the Calycanthus\r\nblooms; they have an aromatic fragrance somewhat like the ripest\r\nPineapples of the tropics, but still richer; how I love to carry them in\r\nmy hand, crushed and warm, occasionally holding them tight over my mouth\r\nand nose to fill myself with their perfume. The leaves have a similar,\r\nbut somewhat varied and sharper, scent, and the woody stems another; the\r\nlatter I like to nibble. This flower has an element of mystery in\r\nit--that indescribable quality felt by children, and remembered by\r\nprosaic grown folk. Perhaps its curious dark reddish brown tint may have\r\nadded part of the queerness, since the \"Mourning Bride,\" similar in\r\ncolor, has a like mysterious association. I cannot explain these\r\nqualities to any one not a garden-bred child; and as given in the\r\nchapter entitled The Mystery of Flowers, they will appear to many,\r\nfanciful and unreal--but I have a fraternity who will understand, and\r\nwho will know that it was this same undefinable quality that made a\r\nbranch of Strawberry bush, or a handful of its stemless blooms, a gift\r\nsignificant of interest and intimacy; we would not willingly give\r\nCalycanthus blossoms to a child we did not like, or to a stranger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hawthorn Arch at Holly House, Peace Dale, Rhode Island.\r\nHome of Rowland G. Hazard, Esq.]\r\n\r\nA rare perfume floats from the modest yellow Flowering Currant. I do not\r\nsee this sweet and sightly shrub in many modern gardens, and it is our\r\nloss. The crowding bees are goodly and cheerful, and the flowers are\r\npleasant, but the perfume is of the sort you can truly say you love it;\r\nits aroma is like some of the liqueurs of the old monks.\r\n\r\nThe greatest pleasure in flower perfumes comes to us through the first\r\nflowers of spring. How we breathe in their sweetness! Our native wild\r\nflowers give us the most delicate odors. The Mayflower is, I believe,\r\nthe only wild flower for which all country folk of New England have a\r\nsincere affection; it is not only a beautiful, an enchanting flower, but\r\nit is so fresh, so balmy of bloom. It has the delicacy of texture and\r\nform characteristic of many of our native spring blooms, Hepatica,\r\nAnemone, Spring Beauty, Polygala.\r\n\r\nThe Arethusa was one of the special favorites of my father and mother,\r\nwho delighted in its exquisite fragrance. Hawthorne said of it: \"One of\r\nthe delicatest, gracefullest, and in every manner sweetest of the whole\r\nrace of flowers. For a fortnight past I have found it in the swampy\r\nmeadows, growing up to its chin in heaps of wet moss. Its hue is a\r\ndelicate pink, of various depths of shade, and somewhat in the form of a\r\nGrecian helmet.\"\r\n\r\nIt pleases me to fancy that Hawthorne was like the Arethusa, that it was\r\na fit symbol of the nature of our greatest New England genius. Perfect\r\nin grace and beauty, full of sentiment, classic and elegant of shape, it\r\nhas a shrinking heart; the sepals and petals rise over it and shield it,\r\nand the whole flower is shy and retiring, hiding in marshes and quaking\r\nbogs.\r\n\r\nIt is one of our flowers which we ever regard singly, as an individual,\r\na rare and fine spirit; we never think of it as growing in an expanse or\r\neven in groups. This lovely flower has, as Landor said of the flower of\r\nthe vine, \"a scent so delicate that it requires a sigh to inhale it.\"\r\n\r\nThe faintest flower scents are the best. You find yourself longing for\r\njust a little more, and you bury your face in the flowers and try to\r\ndraw out a stronger breath of balm. Apple blossoms, certain Violets, and\r\nPansies have this pale perfume.\r\n\r\nIn the front yard of my childhood's home grew a Larch, an exquisitely\r\ngraceful tree, one now little planted in Northern climates. I recall\r\nwith special delight the faint fragrance of its early shoots. The next\r\ntree was a splendid pink Hawthorn. What a day of mourning it was when it\r\nhad to be cut down, for trees had been planted so closely that many must\r\nbe sacrificed as years went on and all grew in stature.\r\n\r\nThere are some smells that are strangely pleasing to the country lover\r\nwhich are neither from fragrant flower nor leaf; one is the scent of the\r\nupturned earth, most heartily appreciated in early spring. The smell of\r\na ploughed field is perhaps the best of all earthy scents, though what\r\nBliss Carman calls \"the racy smell of the forest loam\" is always good.\r\nAnother is the burning of weeds of garden rakings,\r\n\r\n                    \"The spicy smoke\r\n    Of withered weeds that burn where gardens be.\"\r\n\r\nA garden \"weed-smother\" always makes me think of my home garden, and my\r\nfather, who used to stand by this burning weed-heap, raking in the\r\nwithered leaves. Many such scents are pleasing chiefly through the power\r\nof association.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thyme-covered Graves.]\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell in its psychological relations is most subtle:--\r\n\r\n    \"The subtle power in perfume found,\r\n       Nor priest nor sibyl vainly learned;\r\n     On Grecian shrine or Aztec mound\r\n       No censer idly burned.\r\n\r\n    \"And Nature holds in wood and field\r\n       Her thousand sunlit censers still;\r\n     To spells of flower and shrub we yield\r\n       Against or with our will.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Holmes notes that memory, imagination, sentiment, are most readily\r\ntouched through the sense of smell. He tells of the associations borne\r\nto him by the scent of Marigold, of Life-everlasting, of an herb\r\ncloset.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these tributes to sweet scents and to the sense of\r\nsmell, it is not deemed, save in poetry, wholly meet to dwell much on\r\nsmells, even pleasant ones. To all who here sniff a little disdainfully\r\nat a whole chapter given to flower scents, let me repeat the Oriental\r\nproverb:--\r\n\r\n    \"To raise Flowers is a Common Thing,\r\n     God alone gives them Fragrance.\"\r\n\r\nBalmier far, and more stimulating and satisfying than the perfumes of\r\nmost blossoms, is the scent of aromatic or balsamic leaves, of herbs, of\r\ngreen growing things. Sweetbrier, says Thoreau, is thus \"thrice crowned:\r\nin fragrant leaf, tinted flower, and glossy fruit.\" Every spring we\r\nlong, as Whittier wrote--\r\n\r\n    \"To come to Bayberry scented slopes,\r\n       And fragrant Fern and Groundmat vine,\r\n     Breathe airs blown o'er holt and copse,\r\n       Sweet with black Birch and Pine.\"\r\n\r\nAll these scents of holt and copse are dear to New Englanders.\r\n\r\nI have tried to explain the reason for the charm to me of growing Thyme.\r\nIt is not its beautiful perfume, its clear vivid green, its tiny fresh\r\nflowers, or the element of historic interest. Alphonse Karr gives\r\nanother reason, a sentiment of gratitude. He says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Thyme takes upon itself to embellish the parts of the earth which\r\n     other plants disdain. If there is an arid, stony, dry soil, burnt\r\n     up by the sun, it is there Thyme spreads its charming green beds,\r\n     perfumed, close, thick, elastic, scattered over with little balls\r\n     of blossom, pink in color, and of a delightful freshness.\"\r\n\r\nThyme was, in older days, spelt Thime and Time. This made the poet call\r\nit \"pun-provoking Thyme.\" I have an ancient recipe from an old herbal\r\nfor \"Water of Time to ease the Passions of the Heart.\" This remedy is\r\nefficacious to-day, whether you spell it time or thyme.\r\n\r\nThere are shown on page 301 some lonely graves in the old Moravian\r\nburying-ground in Bethlehem, overgrown with the pleasant perfumed Thyme.\r\nAnd as we stand by their side we think with a half smile--a tender\r\none--of the never-failing pun of the old herbalists.\r\n\r\nSpenser called Thyme \"bee-alluring,\" \"honey-laden.\" It was the symbol of\r\nsweetness; and the Thyme that grew on the sunny slopes of Mt. Hymettus\r\ngave to the bees the sweetest and most famed of all honey. The plant\r\nfurnished physic as well as perfume and puns and honey. Pliny named\r\neighteen sovereign remedies made from Thyme. These cured everything from\r\nthe \"bite of poysonful spidars\" to \"the Apoplex.\" There were so many\r\nrecipes in the English _Compleat Chirurgeon_, and similar medical books,\r\nthat you would fancy venomous spiders were as thick as gnats in England.\r\nThese spider cure-alls are however simply a proof that the recipes were\r\ntaken from dose-books of Pliny and various Roman physicians, with whom\r\nspider bites were more common and more painful than in England.\r\n\r\n_The Haven of Health_, written in 1366, with a special view to the\r\ncuring of \"Students,\" says that Wild Thyme has a great power to drive\r\naway heaviness of mind, \"to purge melancholly and splenetick humours.\"\r\nAnd the author recommends to \"sup the leaves with eggs.\" The leaves were\r\nused everywhere \"to be put in puddings and such like meates, so that in\r\ndivers places Thime was called Pudding-grass.\" Pudding in early days was\r\nthe stuffing of meat and poultry, while concoctions of eggs, milk,\r\nflour, sugar, etc., like our modern puddings, were called whitpot.\r\n\r\nMany traditions hang around Thyme. It was used widely in incantations\r\nand charms. It was even one of the herbs through whose magic power you\r\ncould see fairies. Here is a \"Choice Proven Secret made Known\" from the\r\nAshmolean Mss.\r\n\r\n     How to see Fayries\r\n\r\n     \"Rx. A pint of Sallet-Oyle and put it into a\r\n     vial-glasse but first wash it with Rose-water and Marygolde-water\r\n     the Flowers to be gathered toward the East. Wash it until teh Oyle\r\n     come white. Then put it in the glasse, _ut supra_: Then put thereto\r\n     the budds of Holyhocke, the flowers of Marygolde, the flowers or\r\n     toppers of Wild Thyme, the budds of young Hazle: and the time must\r\n     be gathered neare the side of a Hill where Fayries used to be: and\r\n     take the grasse off a Fayrie throne. Then all these put into the\r\n     Oyle into the Glasse, and sette it to dissolve three dayes in the\r\n     Sunne and then keep for thy use _ut supra_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"White Umbrellas of Elder.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I know a bank whereon the Wild Thyme blows\"--it is not in old England,\r\nbut on Long Island; the dense clusters of tiny aromatic flowers form a\r\nthick cushioned carpet under our feet. Lord Bacon says in his essay on\r\nGardens:--\r\n\r\n     \"Those which perfume the air most delightfully, not passed by as\r\n     the rest, but being trodden upon and crushed are three: that is,\r\n     Burnet, Wild Thyme, and Water-Mints. Therefore you are to set whole\r\n     alleys of them, to have the pleasure when you walk or tread.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have an alley of Thyme, set by nature, for us to tread upon and\r\nenjoy, though Thyme always seems to me so classic a plant, that it is\r\nfar too fine to walk upon; one ought rather to sleep and dream upon it.\r\n\r\nGreat bushes of Elder, another flower of witchcraft, grow and blossom\r\nnear my Thyme bank. Old Thomas Browne, as long ago as 1685 called the\r\nElder bloom \"white umbrellas\"--which has puzzled me much, since we are\r\ntold to assign the use and knowledge of umbrellas in England to a much\r\nlater date; perhaps he really wrote umbellas. Now it is a well-known\r\nfact--sworn to in scores of old herbals, that any one who stands on Wild\r\nThyme, by the side of an Elder bush, on Midsummer Eve, will \"see great\r\nexperiences\"; his eyes will be opened, his wits quickened, his vision\r\nclarified; and some have even seen fairies, pixies--Shakespeare's\r\nelves--sporting over the Thyme at their feet.\r\n\r\nI shall not tell whom I saw walking on my Wild Thyme bank last Midsummer\r\nEve. I did not need the Elder bush to open my eyes. I watched the twain\r\nstrolling back and forth in the half-light, and I heard snatches of talk\r\nas they walked toward me, and I lost the responses as they turned from\r\nme. At last, in a louder voice:--\r\n\r\n     HE. \"What is this jolly smell all around here? Just like a\r\n     mint-julep! Some kind of a flower?\"\r\n\r\n     SHE. \"It's Thyme, Wild Thyme; it has run into the edge of the lawn\r\n     from the field, and is just ruining the grass.\"\r\n\r\n     HE (_stooping to pick it_). \"Why, so it is. I thought it came from\r\n     that big white flower over there by the hedge.\"\r\n\r\n     SHE. \"No, that is Elder.\"\r\n\r\n     HE (_after a pause_). \"I had to learn a lot of old Arnold's poetry\r\n     at school once, or in college, and there was some just like\r\n     to-night:--\r\n\r\n    \"'The evening comes--the fields are still,\r\n     The tinkle of the thirsty rill,\r\n     Unheard all day, ascends again.\r\n     Deserted is the half-mown plain,\r\n     And from the Thyme upon the height,\r\n     And from the Elder-blossom white,\r\n     And pale Dog Roses in the hedge,\r\n     And from the Mint-plant in the sedge,\r\n     In puffs of balm the night air blows\r\n     The perfume which the day foregoes--\r\n     And on the pure horizon far\r\n     See pulsing with the first-born star\r\n     The liquid light above the hill.\r\n     The evening comes--the fields are still.'\"\r\n\r\nThen came the silence and half-stiffness which is ever apt to follow any\r\nlong quotation, especially any rare recitation of verse by those who are\r\nnotoriously indifferent to the charms of rhyme and rhythm, and are of\r\nanother sex than the listener. It seems to indicate an unusual condition\r\nof emotion, to be a sort of barometer of sentiment, and the warning of\r\nthreatening weather was not unheeded by her; hence her response was\r\nsomewhat nervous in utterance, and instinctively perverse and\r\ncontradictory.\r\n\r\n     SHE. \"That line, 'The liquid light above the hill,' is very lovely,\r\n     but I can't see that it's any of it at all like to-night.\"\r\n\r\n     HE (_stoutly and resentfully_). \"Oh, no! not at all! There's the\r\n     field, all still, and here's Thyme, and Elder, and there are wild\r\n     Roses!--and see! the moon is coming up--so there's your liquid\r\n     light.\"\r\n\r\n     SHE. \"Well! Yes, perhaps it is; at any rate it is a lovely night.\r\n     You've read _Lavengro_? No? Certainly you must have heard of it.\r\n     The gipsy in it says: 'Life is sweet, brother. There's day and\r\n     night, brother, both sweet things; sun, moon, and stars, brother,\r\n     all sweet things; there is likewise a wind on the heath.'\"\r\n\r\n     HE (_dubiously_). \"That's rather queer poetry, if it is poetry--and\r\n     you must know I do not like to hear you call me brother.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon I discreetly betrayed my near presence on the piazza, to prove\r\nthat the field, though still, was not deserted. And soon the twain said\r\nthey would walk to the club house to view the golf prizes; and they left\r\nthe Wild Thyme and Elder blossoms white, and turned their backs on the\r\nmoon, and fell to golf and other eminently unromantic topics, far safer\r\nfor Midsummer Eve than poesy and other sweet things.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lower Garden at Sylvester Manor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nJOAN SILVER-PIN\r\n\r\n     \"Being of many variable colours, and of great beautie, although of\r\n     evill smell, our gentlewomen doe call them Jone Silver-pin.\"\r\n\r\n     --JOHN GERARDE, _Herball_, 1596.\r\n\r\n\r\nGarden Poppies were the Joan Silver-pin of Gerarde, stigmatized also by\r\nParkinson as \"Jone Silver-pinne, _subauditur_; faire without and foule\r\nwithin.\" In Elizabeth's day Poppies met universal distrust and aversion,\r\nas being the source of the dreaded opium. Spenser called the flower\r\n\"dead-sleeping\" Poppy; Morris \"the black heart, amorous Poppy\"--which\r\nmight refer to the black spots in the flower's heart.\r\n\r\nClare, in his _Shepherd's Calendar_ also asperses them:--\r\n\r\n    \"Corn-poppies, that in crimson dwell,\r\n     Called Head-aches from their sickly smell.\"\r\n\r\nForby adds this testimony: \"Any one by smelling of it for a very short\r\ntime may convince himself of the propriety of the name.\" Some fancied\r\nthat the dazzle of color caused headaches--that vivid scarlet, so fine\r\na word as well as color that it is annoying to hear the poets change it\r\nto crimson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Black Heart, Amorous Poppies.\"]\r\n\r\nThis regard of and aversion to the Poppy lingered among elderly folks\r\ntill our own day; and I well recall the horror of a visitor of antique\r\nyears in our mother's garden during our childhood, when we were found\r\ncheerfully eating Poppy seeds. She viewed us with openly expressed\r\napprehension that we would fall into a stupor; and quite terrified us\r\nand our relatives, in spite of our assertions that we \"always ate them,\"\r\nwhich indeed we always did and do to this day; and very pleasant of\r\ntaste they are, and of absolutely no effect, and not at all of evil\r\nsmell to our present fancy, either in blossom or seed, though distinctly\r\nmedicinal in odor.\r\n\r\nReturned missionaries were frequent and honored visitors in our town and\r\nour house in those days; and one of these good men reassured us and\r\nreinstated in favor our uncanny feast by telling us that in the East,\r\nPoppy seeds were eaten everywhere, and were frequently baked with\r\nwheaten flour into cakes. A dislike of the scent of Field Poppies is\r\noften found among English folk. The author of _A World in a Garden_\r\nspeaks in disgust of \"the pungent and sickly odor of the flaring\r\nPoppies--they positively nauseate me\"; but then he disliked their color\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nThere is something very fine about a Poppy, in the extraordinary\r\ncombination of boldness of color and great size with its slender\r\ndelicacy of stem, the grace of the set of the beautiful buds, the fine\r\nturn of the flower as it opens, and the wonderful airiness of poise of\r\nso heavy a flower. The silkiness of tissue of the petals, and their\r\nsemi-transparency in some colors, and the delicate fringes of some\r\nvarieties, are great charms.\r\n\r\n    \"Each crumpled crepe-like leaf is soft as silk;\r\n       Long, long ago the children saw them there,\r\n     Scarlet and rose, with fringes white as milk,\r\n       And called them 'shawls for fairies' dainty wear';\r\n     They were not finer, those laid safe away\r\n       In that low attic, neath the brown, warm eaves.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when the flowers have shed, oh, so lightly! their silken petals,\r\nthere is still another beauty, a seed vessel of such classic shape that\r\nit wears a crown.\r\n\r\nI have always rejoiced in the tributes paid to the Poppy by Ruskin and\r\nMrs. Thaxter. She deemed them the most satisfactory flower among the\r\nannuals \"for wondrous variety, certain picturesque qualities, for color\r\nand form, and a subtle air of mystery.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a line of Poppy colors which is most entrancing; the gray,\r\nsmoke color, lavender, mauve, and lilac Poppies, edged often and freaked\r\nwith tints of red, are rarely beautiful things. There are fine white\r\nPoppies, some fringed, some single, some double--the Bride is the\r\nappropriate name of the fairest. And the pinks of Poppies, that\r\nwonderful red-pink, and a shell-pink that is almost salmon, and the\r\nsunset pinks of our modern Shirley Poppies, with quality like finest\r\nsilken gauze! The story of the Shirley Poppies is one of magic, that a\r\nflower-loving clergyman who in 1882 sowed the seed of one specially\r\nbeautiful Poppy which had no black in it, and then sowed those of its\r\nfine successors, produced thus a variety which has supplied the world\r\nwith beauty. Rev. Mr. Wilks, their raiser, gives these simply worded\r\nrules anent his Shirley Poppies:--\r\n\r\n     \"1, They are single; 2, always have a white base; 3, with yellow or\r\n     white stamens, anthers, or pollen; 4, and never have the smallest\r\n     particle of black about them.\"\r\n\r\nThe thought of these successful and beautiful Poppies is very\r\nstimulating to flower raisers of moderate means, with no profound\r\nknowledge of flowers; it shows what can be done by enthusiasm and\r\napplication and patience. It gives something of the same comfort found\r\nin Keats's fine lines to the singing thrush:--\r\n\r\n        \"Oh! fret not after knowledge.\r\n    I have none, _and yet the evening listens_.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this distinction and beauty, these fine things of\r\nthe garden were dubbed Joan Silver-pin. I wonder who Joan Silver-pin\r\nwas! I have searched faithfully for her, but have not been able to get\r\non the right scent. Was she of real life, or fiction? I have looked\r\nthrough the lists of characters of contemporary plays, and read a few\r\nold jest books and some short tales of that desperately colorless sort,\r\nwherein you read page after page of the printed words with as little\r\nabsorption of signification as if they were Choctaw. But never have I\r\nseen Joan Silver-pin's name; it was a bit of Elizabethan slang, I\r\nsuspect,--a cant term once well known by every one, now existing solely\r\nthrough this chance reference of the old herbalists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Valerian.]\r\n\r\nNo garden can aspire to be named An Old-fashioned Garden unless it\r\ncontains that beautiful plant the Garden Valerian, known throughout New\r\nEngland to-day as Garden Heliotrope; as Setwall it grew in every old\r\ngarden, as it was in every pharmacopoeia. It was termed\r\n\"drink-quickening Setuale\" by Spenser, from the universal use of its\r\nflowers to flavor various enticing drinks. Its lovely blossoms are\r\npinkish in bud and open to pure white; its curiously penetrating\r\nvanilla-like fragrance is disliked by many who are not cats. I find it\r\nrather pleasing of scent when growing in the garden, and not at all like\r\nthe extremely nasty-smelling medicine which is made from it, and which\r\nhas been used for centuries for \"histerrick fits,\" and is still\r\nconstantly prescribed to-day for that unsympathized-with malady. Dr.\r\nHolmes calls it, \"Valerian, calmer of hysteric squirms.\" It is a\r\nstately plant when in tall flower in June; my sister had great clumps of\r\nbloom like the ones shown above, but alas! the cats caught them before\r\nthe photographer did. The cats did not have to watch the wind and sun\r\nand rain, to pick out plates and pack plate-holders, and gather\r\nray-fillers and cloth and lens, and adjust the tripod, and fix the\r\ncamera and focus, and think, and focus, and think, and then wait--till\r\nthe wind ceased blowing. So when they found it, they broke down every\r\nslender stalk and rolled in it till the ground was tamped down as hard\r\nas if one of our lazy road-menders had been at it. Valerian has in\r\nEngland as an appropriate folk name, \"Cats'-fancy.\" The pretty little\r\nannual, Nemophila, makes also a favorite rolling-place for our cat;\r\nwhile all who love cats have given them Catnip and seen the singular\r\nintoxication it brings. The sight of a cat in this strange ecstasy over\r\na bunch of Catnip always gives me a half-sense of fear; she becomes such\r\na truly wild creature, such a miniature tiger.\r\n\r\nIn _The Art of Gardening_, by J. W., Gent., 1683, the author says of\r\nMarigolds: \"There are divers sorts besides the common as the African\r\nMarigold, a Fair bigge Yellow Flower, but of a very Naughty Smell.\" I\r\ncannot refrain, ere I tell more of the Marigold's naughtiness, to copy a\r\nnote written in this book by a Massachusetts bride whose new husband\r\nowned and studied the book two hundred years ago; for it gives a little\r\nglimpse of old-time life. In her exact little handwriting are these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n     \"Planted in Potts, 1720: An Almond Stone, an English Wallnut,\r\n     Cittron Seeds, Pistachica nutts, Red Damsons, Leamon seeds, Oring\r\n     seeds and Daits.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Anne! she died before she had time to become any one's grandmother.\r\nI hope her successor in matrimony, our forbear, cherished her little\r\nseedlings and rejoiced in the Lemon and Almond trees, though Anne\r\nherself was so speedily forgotten. She is, however, avenged by Time; for\r\nshe is remembered better than the wife who took her place, through her\r\nsimple flower-loving words.\r\n\r\nI am surprised at this aspersion on the Marigold as to its smell, for\r\nall the traditions of this flower show it to have been a great favorite\r\nin kitchen gardens; and I have found that elderly folk are very apt to\r\nlike its scent. My father loved the flower and the fragrance, and liked\r\nto have a bowl of Marigolds stand beside him on his library table. It\r\nwas constantly carried to church as a \"Sabbath-day posy,\" and its petals\r\nused as flavoring in soups and stews. Charles Lamb said it poisoned\r\nthem. Canon Ellacombe writes that it has been banished in England to the\r\ngardens of cottages and old farm-houses; it had a waning popularity in\r\nAmerica, but was never wholly despised.\r\n\r\nHow Edward Fitzgerald loved the African Marigold! \"Its grand color is so\r\ncomfortable to us Spanish-like Paddies,\" he writes to Fanny Kemble in\r\nletters punctuated with little references to his garden flowers: letters\r\nso cheerful, too, with capitals; \"I love the old way of Capitals for\r\nNames,\" he says--and so do I; letters bearing two surprises, namely, the\r\ninfrequent references to Omar Khayyam; and the fact that Nasturtiums,\r\nnot Roses, were his favorite flower.\r\n\r\nThe question of the agreeableness of a flower scent is a matter of\r\npublic opinion as well as personal choice. Environment and education\r\ninfluence us. In olden times every one liked certain scents deemed\r\nodious to-day. Parkinson's praise of Sweet Sultans was, \"They are of so\r\nexceeding sweet a scent as it surpasses the best civet that is.\" Have\r\nyou ever smelt civet? You will need no words to tell you that the civet\r\nis a little cousin of the skunk. Cowper could not talk with civet in the\r\nroom; most of us could not even breathe. The old herbalists call Privet\r\nsweet-scented. I don't know that it is strange to find a generation who\r\nloved civet and musk thinking Privet pleasant-scented. Nearly all our\r\nmodern botanists have copied the words of their predecessors; but I\r\nscarcely know what to say or to think when I find so exact an observer\r\nas John Burroughs calling Privet \"faintly sweet-scented.\" I find it\r\nrankly ill-scented.\r\n\r\nThe men of Elizabethan days were much more learned in perfumes and\r\nfonder of them than are most folk to-day. Authors and poets dwelt\r\nfrankly upon them without seeming at all vulgar. Of course herbalists,\r\nfrom their choice of subject, were free to write of them at length, and\r\nthey did so with evident delight. Nowadays the French realists are the\r\nonly writers who boldly reckon with the sense of smell. It isn't deemed\r\nexactly respectable to dwell too much on smells, even pleasant ones; so\r\nthis chapter certainly must be brief.\r\n\r\nI suppose nine-tenths of all who love flower scents would give Violets\r\nas their favorite fragrance; yet how quickly, in the hothouse Violets,\r\ncan the scent become nauseous. I recall one formal luncheon whereat the\r\nmany tables were mightily massed with violets; and though all looked as\r\nfresh as daybreak to the sight, some must have been gathered for a day\r\nor more, and the stale odor throughout the room was unbearable. But it\r\nis scarcely fair to decry a flower because of its scent in decay.\r\nShakespeare wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"Lilies festered smell far worse than weeds.\"\r\n\r\nMany of our Compositae are vile after standing in water in vases; Ox-eye\r\nDaisies, Rudbeckia, Zinnia, Sunflower, and even the wholesome Marigold.\r\nDelicate as is the scent of the Pansy, the smell of a bed of ancient\r\nPansy plants is bad beyond words. The scent of the flowers of\r\nfruit-bearing trees is usually delightful; but I cannot like the scent\r\nof Pear blossoms.\r\n\r\nI dislike much the rank smell of common yellow Daffodils and of many of\r\nthat family. I can scarcely tolerate them even when freshly picked, upon\r\na dinner table. Some of the Jonquils are as sickening within doors as\r\nthe Tuberose, though in both cases it is only because the scent is\r\nconfined that it is cloying. In the open air, at a slight distance, they\r\nsmell as well as many Lilies, and the Poet's Narcissus is deemed by many\r\ndelightful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old \"War Office.\"]\r\n\r\nI have ever found the scent of Lilacs somewhat imperfect, not well\r\nrounded, not wholly satisfying; but one of my friends can never find in\r\na bunch of our spring Lilacs any odor save that of illuminating gas. I\r\ndo wish he had not told me this! Now when I stand beside my Lilac bush I\r\nfeel like looking around anxiously to see where the gas is escaping.\r\nLinnaeus thought the perfume of Mignonette the purest ambrosia. Another\r\nthinks that Mignonette has a doggy smell, as have several flowers; this\r\nis not wholly to their disparagement. Our cocker spaniel is sweeter than\r\nsome flowers, but he is not a Mignonette. There be those who love most\r\nof all the scent of Heliotrope, which is to me a close, almost musty\r\nscent. I have even known of one or two who disliked the scent of Roses,\r\nand the Rose itself has been abhorred. Marie de' Medici would not even\r\nlook at a painting or carving of a Rose. The Chevalier de Guise had a\r\nloathing for Roses. Lady Heneage, one of the maids of honor to Queen\r\nElizabeth, was made very ill by the presence or scent of Roses. This\r\nillness was not akin to \"Rose cold,\" which is the baneful companion of\r\nso many Americans, and which can conquer its victims in the most sudden\r\nand complete manner.\r\n\r\nEven my affection for Roses, and my intense love of their fragrance,\r\nshown in its most ineffable sweetness in the old pink Cabbage Rose, will\r\nnot cause me to be silent as to the scent of some of the Rose sisters.\r\nSome of the Tea Roses, so lovely of texture, so delicate of hue, are\r\nsickening; one has a suggestion of ether which is most offensive. \"A\r\nRose by any other name would smell as sweet,\" but not if its name (and\r\nits being) was the Persian Yellow. This beautiful double Rose of rich\r\nyellow was introduced to our gardens about 1830. It is infrequent now,\r\nthough I find it in florists' lists; and I suspect I know why. Of late\r\nyears I have not seen it, but I have a remembrance of its uprootal from\r\nour garden. Mrs. Wright confirms my memory by calling it \"a horrible\r\nthing--the Skunk Cabbage of the garden.\" It smells as if foul insects\r\nwere hidden within it, a disgusting smell. I wonder whether poor Marie\r\nde' Medici hadn't had a whiff of it. A Persian Rose! it cannot be\r\npossible that Omar Khayyam ever smelt it, or any of the Rose singers of\r\nPersia, else their praises would have turned to loathing as they fled\r\nfrom its presence. There are two or three yellow Roses which are not\r\npleasing, but are not abhorrent as is the Persian Yellow.\r\n\r\nOne evening last May I walked down the garden path, then by the shadowy\r\nfence-side toward the barn. I was not wandering in the garden for sweet\r\nmoonlight, for there was none; nor for love of flowers, nor in\r\nadmiration of any of nature's works, for it was very cold; we even spoke\r\nof frost, as we ever do apprehensively on a chilly night in spring. The\r\nkitten was lost. She was in the shrubbery at the garden end, for I could\r\nhear her plaintive yowling; and I thus traced her. I gathered her up,\r\npurring and clawing, when I heard by my side a cross rustling of leaves\r\nand another complaining voice. It was the Crown-imperial, unmindful or\r\nunwitting of my presence, and muttering peevishly: \"Here I am, out of\r\nfashion, and therefore out of the world! torn away from the honored\r\nborder by the front door path, and even set away from the broad garden\r\nbeds, and thrust with sunflowers and other plants of no social position\r\nwhatever down here behind the barn, where, she dares to say, we 'can all\r\nsmell to heaven together.'\r\n\r\n\"What airs, forsooth! these twentieth century children put on! Smell to\r\nheaven, indeed! I wish her grandfather could have heard her! He didn't\r\nmake such a fuss about smells when I was young, nor did any one else; no\r\none's nose was so over-nice. Every spring when I came up, glorious in my\r\ndress of scarlet and green, and hung with my jewels of pearls, they were\r\nall glad to see me and to smell me, too; and well they might be, for\r\nthere was a rotten-appley, old-potatoey smell in the cellar which\r\npervaded the whole house when doors were closed. And when the frost came\r\nup from the ground the old sink drain at the kitchen door rendered up\r\nto the spring sunshine all the combined vapors of all the dish-water of\r\nall the winter. The barn and hen-house and cow-house reeked in the\r\nsunlight, but the pigpen easily conquered them all. There was an ancient\r\ncesspool far too near the kitchen door, underground and not to be seen,\r\nbut present, nevertheless. A hogshead of rain-water stood at the cellar\r\ndoor, and one at the end of the barn--to water the flowers with--they\r\nfancied rotten rain-water made flowers grow! A foul dye-tub was ever\r\nreeking in every kitchen chimney corner, a culminating horror in\r\nstenches; and vessels of ancient soap grease festered in the outer shed,\r\nthe grease collected through the winter and waiting for the spring\r\nsoap-making. The vapor of sour milk, ever present, was of little\r\nmoment--when there was so much else so much worse. There wasn't a\r\nbath-tub in the grandfather's house, nor in any other house in town, nor\r\nany too much bathing in winter, either, I am sure, in icy well-water in\r\nicier sleeping rooms. The windows were carefully closed all winter long,\r\nbut the open fireplaces managed to save the life of the inmates, though\r\nthe walls and rafters were hung with millions of germs which every one\r\nknows are all the wickeder when they don't smell, because you take no\r\ncare, fancying they are not there. But the grandfather knew naught of\r\ngerms--and was happy. The trees shaded the house so that the roof was\r\nalways damp. Oh, how those germs grew and multiplied in the grateful\r\nshade of those lovely trees, and how mould and rust rejoiced. Well might\r\npeople turn from all these sights and scents to me. The grandfather and\r\nhis wife, when they were young, as when they were in middle age, and\r\nwhen they were old, walked every early spring day at set of sun, slowly\r\ndown the front path, looking at every flower, every bud; pulling a tiny\r\nweed, gathering a choice flower, breaking a withered sprig; and they\r\never lingered long and happily by my side. And he always said, 'Wife!\r\nisn't this Crown-imperial a glorious plant? so stately, so perfect in\r\nform, such an expression of life, and such a personification of spring!'\r\n'Yes, father,' she would answer quickly, 'but don't pick it.' Why, I\r\nshould have resented even that word had she referred to my perfume. She\r\nmeant that the garden border could not spare me. The children never\r\ncould pick me, even the naughtiest ones did not dare to; but they could\r\npull all the little upstart Ladies' Delights and Violets they wished.\r\nAnd yet, with all this family homage which should make me a family\r\ntotem, here I am, stuck down by the barn--I, who sprung from the blood\r\nof a king, the great Gustavus Adolphus--and was sung by a poet two\r\ncenturies ago in the famous _Garland of Julia_. The old Jesuit poet\r\nRapin said of me, 'No flower aspires in pomp and state so high.'\r\n\r\n\"Read this page from that master-herbalist, John Gerarde, telling of the\r\nrare beauties within my golden cup.\r\n\r\n\"A very intelligent and respectable old gentleman named Parkinson, who\r\nknew far more about flowers than flighty folk do nowadays, loved me well\r\nand wrote of me, 'The Crown-imperial, for its stately beautifulnesse\r\ndeserveth the first place in this our garden of delight to be here\r\nentreated of before all other Lilies.' He had good sense. It was not I\r\nwho was stigmatized by him as Joan Silver-pin. He spoke very plainly and\r\nvery sensibly of my perfume; there was no nonsense in his notions, he\r\ntold the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth: 'The whole\r\nplant and every part thereof, as well as rootes as leaves and floures\r\ndoe smell somewhat strong, as it were the savour of a foxe, so that if\r\nany doe but near it, he can but smell it, yet is not unwholesome.'\r\n\r\n\"How different all is to-day in literature, as well as in flower\r\nculture. Now there are low, coarse attempts at wit that fairly wilt a\r\nsensitive nature like mine. There is one miserable Man who comes to this\r\ngarden, and who _thinks_ he is a Poet; I will not repeat his wretched\r\nrhymes. But only yesterday, when he stood looking superciliously down\r\nupon us, he said sneeringly, 'Yes, spring is here, balmy spring; we know\r\nher presence without seeing her face or hearing her voice; for the Skunk\r\nCabbage is unfurled in the swamps, and the Crown-imperial is blooming in\r\nthe garden.' Think of his presuming to set me alongside that low Skunk\r\nCabbage--me with my 'stately beautifulness.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crown Imperial. A Page from Gerarde's _Herball_.]\r\n\r\n\"Little do people nowadays know about scents anyway, when their\r\nbotanists and naturalists write that the Privet bloom is 'pleasingly\r\nfragrant,' and one dame set last summer a dish of Privet on her dining\r\ntable before many guests. Privet! with its ancient and fishlike smell!\r\nAnd another tells of the fragrant delight of flowering Buckwheat--may\r\nthe breezes blow such fragrance far from me! But why dwell on perfumes;\r\nflowers were made to look at, not to smell; sprays of Sweet Balm or\r\nBasil leaves outsweeten every flower, and make no pretence or thought of\r\nbeauty; render to each its own virtues, and try not to engross the charm\r\nof another.\r\n\r\n\"I was indeed the queen of the garden, and here I am exiled behind the\r\nbarn. Life is not worth living. I won't come up again. She will walk\r\nthrough the garden next May and say, 'How dull and shabby the garden\r\nlooks this year! the spring is backward, everything has run to leaves,\r\nnothing is in bloom, we must buy more fertilizer, we must get a new\r\ngardener, we must get more plants and slips and seeds and bulbs, it is\r\nfearfully discouraging, I never saw anything so gone off!' then perhaps\r\nshe will remember, and regret the friend of her grandparents, the\r\nCrown-imperial--whom she thrust from her Garden of Delight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCHILDHOOD IN A GARDEN\r\n\r\n    \"I see the garden thicket's shade\r\n     Where all the summer long we played,\r\n     And gardens set and houses made,\r\n         Our early work and late.\"\r\n\r\n    --MARY HOWITT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow we thank God for the noble traits of our ancestors; and our hearts\r\nfill with gratitude for the tenderness, the patience, the loving\r\nkindness of our parents; I have an infinite deal for which to be\r\nsincerely grateful; but for nothing am I now more happy than that there\r\nwere given to me a flower-loving father and mother. To that\r\nflower-loving father and mother I offer in tenderest memory equal\r\ngratitude for a childhood spent in a garden.\r\n\r\nWinter as well as summer gave us many happy garden hours. Sometimes a\r\nsudden thaw of heavy snow and an equally quick frost formed a miniature\r\npond for sheltered skating at the lower end of the garden. A frozen\r\ncrust of snow (which our winters nowadays so seldom afford) gave other\r\njoys. And the delights of making a snow man, or a snow fort, even of\r\nrolling great globes of snow, were infinite and varied. More subtle was\r\nthe charm of shaping certain _things_ from dried twigs and evergreen\r\nsprigs, and pouring water over them to freeze into a beautiful\r\nresemblance of the original form. These might be the ornate initials or\r\nname of a dear girl friend, or a tiny tower or pagoda. I once had a real\r\nwinter garden in miniature set in twigs of cedar and spruce, and frozen\r\ninto a fairy garden.\r\n\r\nIn summertime the old-fashioned garden was a paradise for a child; the\r\nlong warm days saw the fresh telling of child to child, by that\r\ncuriously subtle system of transmission which exists everywhere among\r\nhappy children, of quaint flower customs known to centuries of\r\nEnglish-speaking children, and also some newer customs developed by the\r\nfitness of local flowers for such games and plays.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Potocka says the intense enjoyment of nature is a sixth\r\nsense. We are not born with this good gift, nor do we often acquire it\r\nin later life; it comes through our rearing. The fulness of delight in a\r\ngarden is the bequest of a childhood spent in a garden. No study or\r\npossession of flowers in mature years can afford gratification equal to\r\nthat conferred by childish associations with them; by the sudden\r\nrecollection of flower lore, the memory of child friendships, the\r\nrecalling of games or toys made of flowers: you cannot explain it; it\r\nseems a concentration, an extract of all the sunshine and all the beauty\r\nof those happy summers of our lives when the whole day and every day was\r\nspent among flowers. The sober teachings of science in later years can\r\nnever make up the loss to children debarred of this inheritance, who\r\nhave grown up knowing not when \"the summer comes with bee and flower.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Milkweed Seed.]\r\n\r\nA garden childhood gives more sources of delight to the senses in after\r\nlife than come from beautiful color and fine fragrance. Have you\r\npleasure in the contact of a flower? Do you like its touch as well as\r\nits perfume? Do you love to feel a Lilac spray brush your cheek in the\r\ncool of the evening? Do you like to bury your face in a bunch of Roses?\r\nHow frail and papery is the Larkspur! And how silky is the Poppy! A\r\nLocust bloom is a fringe of sweetness; and how very doubtful is the\r\ntouch of the Lily--an unpleasant thick sleekness. The Clove Carnation is\r\nthe best of all. It feels just as it smells. These and scores more give\r\nme pleasure through their touch, the result of constant handling of\r\nflowers when I was a child.\r\n\r\nThere were harmful flowers in the old garden--among them the\r\nMonk's-hood; we never touched it, except warily. Doubtless we were\r\nwarned, but we knew it by instinct and did not need to be told. I always\r\nused to see in modest homes great tubs each with a flourishing Oleander\r\ntree. I have set out scores of little slips of Oleander, just as I\r\nplanted Orange seeds. I seldom see Oleanders now; I wonder whether the\r\nplant has been banished on account of its poisonous properties. I heard\r\nof but one fatal case of Oleander poisoning--and that was doubtful. A\r\nlittle child, the sister of one of my playmates, died suddenly in great\r\ndistress. Several months after her death the mother was told that the\r\nleaves of the Oleander were poisonous, when she recalled that the child\r\nhad eaten them on the day of her death.\r\n\r\nOleander blossoms were lovely in shape and color. Edward Fitzgerald\r\nwrites to Fanny Kemble: \"Don't you love the Oleander? So clean in its\r\nLeaves and Stem, as so beautiful in its Flower; loving to stand in water\r\nwhich it drinks up fast. I have written all my best Mss. with a Pen that\r\nhas been held with its nib in water for more than a fortnight--Charles\r\nKeene's recipe for keeping Pens in condition--Oleander-like.\" This,\r\nwritten in 1882, must, even at that recent date, refer to quill pens.\r\n\r\nThe lines of Mary Howitt's, quoted at the beginning of this chapter,\r\nring to me so true; there is in them no mock sentiment, it is the real\r\nthing,--\"the garden thicket's shade,\" little \"cubby houses\" under the\r\nclose-growing stems of Lilac and Syringa, with an old thick shawl\r\noutspread on the damp earth for a carpet. Oh, how hot and scant the air\r\nwas in the green light of those close \"garden-thickets,\" those \"Lilac\r\nambushes,\" which were really not half so pleasant as the cooler seats on\r\nthe grass under the trees, but which we clung to with a warmth equal to\r\ntheir temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Children's Garden.]\r\n\r\nLet us peer into these garden thickets at these happy little girls,\r\nfantastic in their garden dress. Their hair is hung thick with Dandelion\r\ncurls, made from pale green opal-tinted stems that have grown long under\r\nthe shrubbery and Box borders. Around their necks are childish wampum,\r\nstrings of Dandelion beads or Daisy chains. More delicate wreaths for\r\nthe neck or hair were made from the blossoms of the Four-o'clock or\r\nthe petals of Phlox or Lilacs, threaded with pretty alternation of\r\ncolor. Fuchsias were hung at the ears for eardrops, green leaves were\r\npinned with leaf stems into little caps and bonnets and aprons,\r\nFoxgloves made dainty children's gloves. Truly the garden-bred child\r\nwent in gay attire.\r\n\r\nThat exquisite thing, the seed of Milkweed (shown on page 328),\r\nfurnished abundant playthings. The plant was sternly exterminated in our\r\ngarden, but sallies into a neighboring field provided supplies for fairy\r\ncradles with tiny pillows of silvery silk.\r\n\r\nOne of the early impulses of infancy is to put everything in the mouth;\r\nthis impulse makes the creeping days of some children a period of\r\nconstant watchfulness and terror to their apprehensive guardians. When\r\nthe children are older and can walk in the garden or edge of the woods,\r\na fresh anxiety arises; for a certain savagery in their make-up makes\r\nthem regard every growing thing, not as an object to look at or even to\r\nplay with, but to eat. It is a relief to the mother when the child grows\r\nbeyond the savage, and falls under the dominion of tradition and\r\nfolk-lore, communicated to him by other children by that subtle power of\r\nenlightenment common to children, which seems more like instinct than\r\ninstruction. The child still eats, but he makes distinctions, and seldom\r\ntouches harmful leaves or seeds or berries. He has an astonishing range:\r\nroots, twigs, leaves, bark, tendrils, fruit, berries, flowers, buds,\r\nseeds, all alike serve for food. Young shoots of Sweetbrier and\r\nBlackberry are nibbled as well as the branches of young Birch. Grape\r\ntendrils, too, have an acid zest, as do Sorrel leaves. Wild Rose hips\r\nand the drupes of dwarf Cornel are chewed. The leaf buds of Spruce and\r\nLinden are also tasted. I hear that some children in some places eat the\r\nyoung fronds of Cinnamon Fern, but I never saw it done. Seeds of\r\nPumpkins and Sunflowers were edible, as well as Hollyhock cheeses. There\r\nwas one Slippery Elm tree which we know in our town, and we took ample\r\ntoll of it. Cherry gum and Plum gum are chewed, as well as the gum of\r\nSpruce trees. There was a boy who used sometimes to intrude on our\r\ngirl's paradise, since he was the son of a neighbor, and he said he ate\r\nraw Turnips, and something he called Pig-nuts--I wonder what they were.\r\n\r\nThose childish customs linger long in our minds, or rather in our\r\nsubconsciousness. I never walk through an old garden without wishing to\r\nnibble and browse on the leaves and stems which I ate as a child,\r\nwithout sucking a drop of honey from certain flowers. I do it not with\r\nintent, but I waken to realization with the petal of Trumpet Honeysuckle\r\nin my hand and its drop of ambrosia on my lips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Foxgloves in a Narragansett Garden.]\r\n\r\nChildren care far less for scent and perfection in a flower than they do\r\nfor color, and, above all, for desirability and adaptability of form,\r\nthis desirability being afforded by the fitness of the flower for the\r\ntraditional games and plays. The favorite flowers of my childhood were\r\nthree noble creatures, Hollyhocks, Canterbury Bells, and Foxgloves, all\r\nthree were scentless. I cannot think of a child's summer in a garden\r\nwithout these three old favorites of history and folk-lore. Of course we\r\nenjoyed the earlier flower blooms and played happily with them ere our\r\ndearest treasures came to us; but never had we full variety, zest, and\r\nsatisfaction till this trio were in midsummer bloom. There was a little\r\ngawky, crudely-shaped wooden doll of German manufacture sold in\r\nWorcester which I never saw elsewhere; they were kept for sale by old\r\nWaxler, the German basket maker, a most respected citizen, whose name I\r\nnow learn was not Waxler but Weichsler. These dolls came in three\r\nsizes, the five-cent size was a midsummer favorite, because on its\r\nfeatureless head the blossoms of the Canterbury Bells fitted like a high\r\nazure cap. I can see rows of these wooden creatures sitting, thus\r\ncrowned, stiffly around the trunk of the old Seckel Pear tree at a\r\ndoll's tea-party.\r\n\r\nBy the constant trampling of our childish feet the earth at the end of\r\nthe garden path was hard and smooth under the shadow of the Lilac trees\r\nnear our garden fence; and this hard path, remote from wanderers in the\r\ngarden, made a splendid plateau to use for flower balls. Once we fitted\r\nit up as a palace; circular walls of Balsam flowers set closely together\r\nshaped the ball-room. The dancers were blue and white Canterbury Bells.\r\nQuadrilles were placed of little twigs, or strong flower stalks set\r\nfirmly upright in the hard trodden earth, and on each of these a flower\r\nbell was hung so that the pretty reflexion of the scalloped edges of the\r\ncorolla just touched the ground as the hooped petticoats swayed lightly\r\nin the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hollyhocks in Garden of Kimball Homestead, Portsmouth,\r\nNew Hampshire.]\r\n\r\nWe used to catch bumblebees in the Canterbury Bells, and hear them buzz\r\nand bump and tear their way out to liberty. We held the edges of the\r\nflower tightly pinched together, and were never stung. Besides its\r\nadaptability as a toy for children, the Canterbury Bell was beloved for\r\nits beauty in the garden. An appropriate folk name for it is\r\nFair-in-sight. Healthy clumps grow tall and stately, towering up as high\r\nas childish heads; and the firm stalks are hung so closely in bloom.\r\nNowadays people plant expanses of Canterbury Bells; one at the\r\nbeautiful garden at White Birches, Elmhurst, Illinois, is shown on page\r\n111. I do not like this as well as the planting in our home garden when\r\nthey are set in a mixed border, as shown opposite page 416. Our tastes\r\nin the flower world are largely influenced by what we were wonted to in\r\nchildhood, not only in the selection of flowers, but in their placing in\r\nour gardens. The Canterbury Bell has historical interest through its\r\nbeing named for the bells borne by pilgrims to the shrine at Canterbury.\r\nI have been delighted to see plants of these sturdy garden favorites\r\noffered for sale of late years in New York streets in springtime, by\r\nstreet venders, who now show a tendency to throw aside Callas, Lilies,\r\nTuberoses, and flowers of such ilk, and substitute shrubs and seedlings\r\nof hardy growth and satisfactory flowering. But it filled me with\r\nregret, to hear the pretty historic name--Canterbury Bells--changed in\r\nso short a residence in the city, by these Italian and German tongues to\r\nGingerbread Bells--a sad debasement. Native New Englanders have seldom\r\nforgotten or altered an old flower name, and very rarely transferred it\r\nto another plant, even in two centuries of everyday usage. But I am glad\r\nto know that the flower will bloom in the flower pot or soap box in the\r\ndingy window of the city poor, or in the square foot of earth of the\r\ncity squatter, even if it be called Gingerbread Bells.\r\n\r\nI think we may safely affirm that the Hollyhock is the most popular, and\r\nmost widely known, of all old-fashioned flowers. It is loved for its\r\nbeauty, its associations, its adaptiveness. It is such a decorative\r\nflower, and looks of so much distinction in so many places. It is\r\ninvaluable to the landscape gardener and to the architect; and might be\r\nnamed the wallflower, since it looks so well growing by every wall. I\r\nlike it there, or by a fence-side, or in a corner, better than in the\r\nmiddle of flower beds. How many garden pictures have Hollyhocks? Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds even used them as accessories of his portraits. They\r\nusually grow so well and bloom so freely. I have seen them in\r\nConnecticut growing wild--garden strays, standing up by ruined stone\r\nwalls in a pasture with as much grace of grouping, as good form, as if\r\nthey had been planted by our most skilful gardeners or architects. Many\r\nillustrations of them are given in this book; I need scarcely refer to\r\nthem; opposite page 334 is shown a part of the four hundred stalks of\r\nrich bloom in a Portsmouth garden. There is a pretty semidouble\r\nHollyhock with a single row of broad outer petals and a smaller double\r\nrosette for the centre; but the single flowers are far more effective. I\r\nlike well the old single crimson flower, but the yellow ones are, I\r\nbelieve, the loveliest; a row of the yellow and white ones against an\r\nold brick wall is perfection. I can never repay to the Hollyhock the\r\ndebt of gratitude I owe for the happy hours it furnished to me in my\r\nchildhood. Its reflexed petals could be tied into such lovely\r\nsilken-garbed dolls; its \"cheeses\" were one of the staple food supplies\r\nof our dolls' larder. I am sure in my childhood I would have warmly\r\nchosen the Hollyhock as my favorite flower.\r\n\r\nThe sixty-two folk names of the Foxglove give ample proof of its\r\ncloseness to humanity; it is a familiar flower, a home flower. Of these\r\nmany names I never heard but two in New England, and those but once; an\r\nold Irish gardener called the flowers Fairy Thimbles, and an English\r\nservant, Pops--this from the well-known habit of popping the petals on\r\nthe palm of the hand. We used to build little columns of these Foxgloves\r\nby thrusting one within another, alternating purple and white; and we\r\nwore them for gloves, and placed them as foolscaps on the heads of tiny\r\ndolls. The beauty of the Foxglove in the garden is unquestioned; the\r\nspires of white bloom are, as Cotton Mather said of a pious and painful\r\nPuritan preacher, \"a shining and white light in a golden candlestick\r\nimproved for the sweet felicity of Mankind and to the honour of our\r\nMaker.\"\r\n\r\nOpposite page 340 is a glimpse of a Box-edged garden in Worcester, whose\r\nblossoming has been a delight to me every summer of my entire life. In\r\nmy childhood this home was that of flower-loving neighbors who had an\r\nestablished and constant system of exchange with my mother and other\r\nneighbors of flowers, plants, seeds, slips, and bulbs. The garden was\r\nserene with an atmosphere of worthy old age; you wondered how any man so\r\nold could so constantly plant, weed, prune, and hoe until you saw how he\r\nloved his flowers, and how his wife loved them. The Roses, Peonies, and\r\nFlower de Luce in this garden are sixty years old, and the Box also; the\r\nshrubs are almost trees. Nothing seems to be transplanted, yet all\r\nflourish; I suppose some plants must be pulled up, sometimes, else the\r\ngarden would be a thicket. The varying grading of city streets has left\r\nthis garden in a little valley sheltered from winds and open to the\r\nsun's rays. Here bloom Crocuses, Snowdrops, Grape Hyacinths, and\r\nsometimes Tulips, before any neighbor has a blossom and scarce a leaf.\r\nOn a Sunday noon in April there are always flower lovers hanging over\r\nthe low fences, and gazing at the welcome early blooms. Here if ever,\r\n\r\n    \"Winter, slumbering in the open air,\r\n     Wears on his smiling face a dream of spring.\"\r\n\r\nA close cloud of Box-scent hangs over this garden, even in midwinter;\r\nsometimes the Box edgings grow until no one can walk between; then\r\ndrastic measures have to be taken, and the rows look ragged for a time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Autumn Path in a Worcester Garden.]\r\n\r\nI think much of my love of Box comes from happy associations with this\r\ngarden. I used to like to go there with my mother when she went on what\r\nthe Japanese would call \"garden-viewing\" visits, for at the lower end of\r\nthe garden was a small orchard of the finest playhouse Apple trees I\r\never climbed (and I have had much experience), and some large trees\r\nbearing little globular early Pears; and there were rows of bushes of\r\ngolden \"Honeyblob\" Gooseberries. The Apple trees are there still, but\r\nthe Gooseberry bushes are gone. I looked for them this summer eagerly,\r\nbut in vain; I presume the berries would have been sour had I found\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hollyhocks at Tudor Place.]\r\n\r\nIn many old New England gardens the close juxtaposition and even\r\nintermingling of vegetables and fruits with the flowers gave a sense of\r\nhomely simplicity and usefulness which did not detract from the garden's\r\ninterest, and added much to the child's pleasure. At the lower end of\r\nthe long flower border in our garden, grew \"Mourning Brides,\" white,\r\npale lavender, and purple brown in tint. They opened under the shadow of\r\na row of Gooseberry bushes. I seldom see Gooseberry bushes nowadays in\r\nany gardens, whether on farms or in nurseries; they seem to be an\r\nantiquated fruit.\r\n\r\nI have in my memory many other customs of childhood in the garden; some\r\nof them I have told in my book _Child Life in Colonial Days_, and there\r\nare scores more which I have not recounted, but most of them were\r\npeculiar to my own fanciful childhood, and I will not recount them here.\r\n\r\nOne of the most exquisite of Mrs. Browning's poems is _The Lost Bower_;\r\nit is endeared to me because it expresses so fully a childish\r\nbereavement of my own, for I have a lost garden. Somewhere, in my\r\nchildhood, I saw this beautiful garden, filled with radiant blossoms,\r\nrich with fruit and berries, set with beehives, rabbit hutches, and a\r\ndove cote, and enclosed about with hedges; and through it ran a purling\r\nbrook--a thing I ever longed for in my home garden. All one happy summer\r\nafternoon I played in it, and gathered from its beds and borders at\r\nwill--and I have never seen it since. When I was still a child I used to\r\nask to return to it, but no one seemed to understand; and when I was\r\ngrown I asked where it was, describing it in every detail, and the only\r\nanswer was that it was a dream, I had never seen and played in such a\r\ngarden. This lost garden has become to me an emblem, as was the lost\r\nbower to Mrs. Browning, of the losses of life; but I did not lose all;\r\nwhile memory lasts I shall ever possess the happiness of my childhood\r\npassed in our home garden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Old Worcester Garden.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMEETIN' SEED AND SABBATH DAY POSIES\r\n\r\n      \"I touched a thought, I know\r\n     Has tantalized me many times.\r\n     Help me to hold it! First it left\r\n     The yellowing Fennel run to seed.\"\r\n\r\n    --ROBERT BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy \"thought\" is the association of certain flowers with Sunday; the fact\r\nthat special flowers and leaves and seeds, Fennel, Dill, and\r\nSouthernwood, were held to be fitting and meet to carry to the Sunday\r\nservice. \"Help me to hold it\"--to record those simple customs of the\r\ncountry-side ere they are forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn the herb garden grew three free-growing plants, all three called\r\nindifferently in country tongue, \"meetin' seed.\" They were Fennel, Dill,\r\nand Caraway, and similar in growth and seed. Caraway is shown on page\r\n342. Their name was given because, in summer days of years gone by,\r\nnearly every woman and child carried to \"meeting\" on Sundays, bunches of\r\nthe ripe seeds of one or all of these three plants, to nibble throughout\r\nthe long prayers and sermon.\r\n\r\nIt is fancied that these herbs were anti-soporific, but I find no record\r\nof such power. On the contrary, Galen says Dill \"procureth sleep,\r\nwherefore garlands of Dill are worn at feasts.\" A far more probable\r\nreason for its presence at church was the quality assigned to it by\r\nPliny and other herbalists down to Gerarde, that of staying the \"yeox or\r\nhicket or hicquet,\" otherwise the hiccough. If we can judge by the\r\nmanifold remedies offered to allay this affliction, it was certainly\r\nvery prevalent in ancient times. Cotton Mather wrote a bulky medical\r\ntreatise entitled _The Angel of Bethesda_. It was never printed; the\r\nmanuscript is owned by the American Antiquarian Society. The character\r\nof this medico-religious book may be judged by this opening sentence of\r\nhis chapter on the hiccough:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Hiccough or the Hicox rather, for it's a Teutonic word that\r\n     signifies to sob, appears a Lively Emblem of the battle between the\r\n     Flesh and the Spirit in the Life of Piety. The Conflict in the\r\n     Pious Mind gives all the Trouble and same uneasiness as Hickox.\r\n     Death puts an end to the Conflict.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Caraway.]\r\n\r\nParson Mather gives Tansy and Caraway as remedies for the hiccough, but\r\nfar better still--spiders, prepared in various odious ways; I prefer\r\nDill.\r\n\r\nPeter Parley said that \"a sprig of Fennel was the theological\r\nsmelling-bottle of the tender sex, and not unfrequently of the men, who\r\nfrom long sitting in the sanctuary, after a week of labor in the field,\r\nfound themselves tempted to sleep, would sometimes borrow a sprig of\r\nFennel, to exorcise the fiend that threatened their spiritual welfare.\"\r\n\r\nOld-fashioned folk kept up a constant nibbling in church, not only of\r\nthese three seeds, but of bits of Cinnamon or Lovage root, or, more\r\ncommonly still, the roots of Sweet Flag. Many children went to\r\nbrooksides and the banks of ponds to gather these roots. This pleasure\r\nwas denied to us, but we had a Flag root purveyor, our milkman's\r\ndaughter. This milkman, who lived on a lonely farm, used often to take\r\nwith him on his daily rounds his little daughter. She sat with him on\r\nthe front seat of his queer cart in summer and his queerer pung in\r\nwinter, an odd little figure, with a face of gypsylike beauty which\r\ncould scarcely be seen in the depths of the Shaker sunbonnet or pumpkin\r\nhood. If my mother chanced to see her, she gave the child an orange, or\r\na few figs, or some little cakes, or almonds and raisins; in return the\r\nchild would throw out to us violently roots of Sweet Flag, Wild Ginger,\r\nSnakeroot, Sassafras, and Apples or Pears, which she carried in a deep\r\ndetached pocket at her side. She never spoke, and the milkman confided\r\nto my mother that he \"took her around because she was so wild,\" by\r\nwhich he meant timid. We were firmly convinced that the child could not\r\nwalk nor speak, and had no ears; and we were much surprised when she\r\nwalked down the aisle of our church one Sunday as actively as any child\r\ncould, displaying very natural ears. Her father had bought a home in the\r\ntown that she might go to school. He was rewarded by her development\r\ninto one of those scholars of phenomenal brilliancy, such as are\r\noccasionally produced from New England farmers' families. She also\r\nbecame a beauty of most unusual type. At her father's death she \"went\r\nWest.\" I have always expected to read of her as of marked life in some\r\nway, but I never have. Of course her family name may have been changed\r\nby marriage; but her Christian name, Appoline, was so unusual I could\r\ncertainly trace her. If my wild and beautiful little milk girl reads\r\nthese lines, I hope she will forgive me, for she certainly was queer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial of Jonathan Fairbanks.]\r\n\r\nWhen her residence was in town, Appoline did not cease her gifts of\r\ncountry treasures. She brought on spring Sundays a very delightful\r\naddition to our Sabbath day nibblings and browsings, the most delicious\r\nmouthful of all the treasures of New England woods, what we called\r\nPippins, the first tender leaves of the aromatic Checkerberry. In the\r\nautumn the spicy berries of the same plant filled many a paper\r\ncornucopia which was secretly conveyed to us.\r\n\r\nIt was also a universal custom among the elder folk to carry a Sunday\r\nposy; the stems were discreetly enwrapped with the folded handkerchief\r\nwhich also concealed the sprig of Fennel. Dean Hole tells us that a\r\nsprig of Southernwood was always seen in the Sunday smocks of English\r\nfarm folk. Mary Howitt, in her poem, _The Poor Man's Garden_, has this\r\nverse:--\r\n\r\n    \"And here on Sabbath mornings\r\n     The goodman comes to get\r\n     His Sunday nosegay--Moss Rose bud,\r\n     White Pink, and Mignonette.\"\r\n\r\nThis shows to me that the church posy was just as common in England as\r\nin America; in domestic and social customs we can never disassociate\r\nourselves from England; our ways, our deeds, are all English.\r\n\r\nThoreau noted with pleasure when, at the last of June, the young men of\r\nConcord \"walked slowly and soberly to church, in their best clothes,\r\neach with a Pond Lily in his hand or bosom, with as long a stem as he\r\ncould get.\" And he adds thereto almost the only decorous and\r\nconventional picture he gives of himself, that he used in early life to\r\ngo thus to church, smelling a Pond Lily, \"its odor contrasting with and\r\natoning for that of the sermon.\" He associated this universal bearing of\r\nthe Lily with a very natural act, that of the first spring swim and\r\nbath, and pictured with delight the quiet Sabbath stillness and the pure\r\nopening flowers. He said the flower had become typical to him equally of\r\na Sunday morning swim and of church-going. He adds that the young women\r\ncarried on this floral Sunday, as a companion flower, their first Rose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bronze Sun-dial on Dutch Reformed Church. West End\r\nAvenue, New York.]\r\n\r\nThis Sabbath bearing of the early Water Lilies may have been a local\r\ncustom; a few miles from Walden Pond and Concord an old kinsman of mine\r\nthroughout his long life (which closed twenty years ago) carried Water\r\nLilies on summer Sundays to church; and starting with neighborly intent\r\na short time before the usual hour of church service, he placed a\r\nsingle beautiful Lily in the pew of each of his old friends. All knew\r\nwho was the flower bearer, and gentle smiles and nods of thanks would\r\nradiate across the old church to him. These lilies were gathered for him\r\nfreshly each Sabbath morning by the young men of his family, who, as\r\nThoreau tells, all took their morning bath in the pond throughout the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial on Boulder, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nThere were conventions in these Sunday posies. I never heard of carrying\r\nsprays of Lemon Verbena or Rose Geranium, or any of the strong-scented\r\nherbs of the Mint family; but throughout eastern Massachusetts,\r\nespecially in Concord and Wayland, a favorite posy was a spray of the\r\nrefreshing, soft-textured leaves from what country folk called the\r\nTongue plant--which was none other than Costmary, also called Beaver\r\ntongue, and Patagonian mint. As there has been recently much interest\r\nand discussion anent this Tongue plant, I here give its botanical name\r\n_Chrysanthemum balsamita_, var. _tanacetoides_. A far more popular\r\nSunday posy than any blossom was a sprig of Southernwood, known also\r\neverywhere as Lad's-love, and occasionally as Old Man and\r\nKiss-me-quick-and-go. It was also termed Meeting plant from this\r\nuniversal Sunday use.\r\n\r\nA restless little child was once handed during the church services in\r\nsummer a bunch of Caraway seeds, and a goodly sprig of Southernwood. The\r\nlittle girl's mother listened earnestly to the long sermon, and was\r\nhorrified at its close to find that her child had eaten the entire bunch\r\nof Caraway, stems and seeds, and all the bitter Southernwood. She was\r\nhurried out of church to the village doctor's, and spent a very unhappy\r\nhour or two as the result of her Nebuchadnezzar-like gorging.\r\n\r\nLike many New Englanders, I dearly love the scent of Southernwood:--\r\n\r\n                  \"I'll give to him\r\n    Who gathers me, more sweetness than he knows\r\n    Without me--more than any Lily could,\r\n    I, that am flowerless, being Southernwood.\"\r\n\r\nSouthernwood bears a balmier breath than is ever borne by many blossoms,\r\nfor it is sweet with the fragrance of memory. The scent that has been\r\nloved for centuries, the leaves that have been pressed to the hearts of\r\nfair maids, as they questioned of love, are indeed endeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buckthorn Arch in an Old Salem Garden.]\r\n\r\nSouthernwood was a plant of vast powers. It was named in the fourteenth\r\ncentury as potent to cure talking in sleep, and other \"vanityes of\r\nthe heade.\" An old Salem sea captain had this recipe for baldness: \"Take\r\na quantitye of Suthernwoode and put it upon kindled coale to burn and\r\nbeing made into a powder mix it with oyl of radiches, and anoynt a bald\r\nhead and you shall see great experiences.\" The lying old _Dispensatory_\r\nof Culpepper gave a rule to mix the ashes of Southernwood with \"Old\r\nSallet Oyl\" which \"helpeth those that are hair-fallen and bald.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial at Emery Place, Brightwood, District of\r\nColumbia.]\r\n\r\nFar pleasanter were the uses of the plant as a love charm. Pliny did not\r\ndisdain to counsel putting Southernwood under the pillow to make one\r\ndream of a lover. A sprig of Southernwood in an unmarried girl's shoe\r\nwould bring to her the sight of her husband-to-be before night.\r\n\r\nSixty years ago two young country folk of New England were married. The\r\ntwain built them a house and established their home. Since a sprig of\r\nSouthernwood had played a romantic part in their courtship, each planted\r\na bush at the side of the broad doorstone; and the husband, William,\r\noften thrust a bit of this Lad's-love from the flourishing bushes in the\r\nbuttonhole of his woollen shirt, for he fancied the fresh scent of the\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial at Traveller's Rest.]\r\n\r\nThe twain had no children, and perhaps therefrom grew and increased in\r\nHetty a fairly passionate love of exact order and neatness in her\r\nhome--a trait which is not so common in New England housewives as many\r\nfancy, and which does not always find equal growth and encouragement in\r\nNew England husbands. William chafed under the frequent and bitter\r\nreproofs for the muddy shoes, dusty garments, hanging straws and seeds\r\nwhich he brought into his wife's orderly paradise, and the jarring\r\nculminated one night over such a trifle, a green sprig of Lad's-love\r\nwhich he had dropped and trodden into the freshly washed floor of the\r\nkitchen, where it left a green stain on the spotless boards.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel flamed high, and was followed by an ominous calm which was\r\nnot broken at breakfast. It would be impossible to express in words\r\nHetty's emotions when she crossed her threshold to set her shining milk\r\ntins in the morning sunlight, and saw on one side of the doorstone a\r\nyawning hole where had grown for ten years William's bunch of\r\nLad's-love. He had driven to the next village to sell some grain, so she\r\ncould search unseen for the vanished emblem of domestic felicity, and\r\nsoon she found it, in the ditch by the public road, already withered in\r\nthe hot sun.\r\n\r\nWhen her husband went at nightfall to feed and water his cattle, he\r\nfound the other bush of Lad's-love, which had been planted with such\r\naffectionate sentiment, trodden in the mire of the pigpen, under the\r\nfeet of the swine.\r\n\r\nThey lived together for thirty years after this crowning indignity. The\r\ngrass grew green over the empty holes by the doorside, but he never\r\nforgave her, and they never spoke to each other save in direst\r\nnecessity, and then in fewest words. Yet they were not wicked folk. She\r\ncared for his father and mother in the last years of their life with a\r\ndevotion that was fairly pathetic when it was seen that the old man was\r\nuntidy to a degree, and absolutely oblivious of all her orderly ways and\r\nwishes. At their death he sent for and \"homed,\" as the expression ran, a\r\nbrother of hers who was almost blind, and paid the expenses of her\r\nnephew through college--but he died unforgiving; the sight of that\r\nbeloved Southernwood--in the pigpen--forever killed his affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSUN-DIALS\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis an old dial, dark with many a stain,\r\n     In summer crowned with drifting orchard bloom,\r\n     Tricked in the autumn with the yellow rain,\r\n     And white in winter like a marble tomb.\r\n\r\n    \"And round about its gray, time-eaten brow\r\n     Lean letters speak--a worn and shattered row:--\r\n     'I am a Shade; A Shadowe too arte thou;\r\n     I mark the Time; saye, Gossip, dost thou soe?'\"\r\n\r\n    --AUSTIN DOBSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nA century or more ago, in the heart of nearly all English gardens, and\r\nin the gardens of our American colonies as well, there might be seen a\r\npedestal of varying material, shape, and pretension, surmounted by the\r\nmost interesting furnishing in \"dead-works\" of the garden, a sun-dial.\r\nIn public squares, on the walls of public buildings, on bridges, and by\r\nthe side of the way, other and simpler dials were found. On the walls of\r\ncountry houses and churches vertical sun-dials were displayed; every\r\nEnglish town held them by scores. In Scotland, and to some extent in\r\nEngland, these sun-dials still are found; in fine old gardens the most\r\nrichly carved dials are standing; but in America they have become so\r\nrare that many people have never seen one. In many of the formal gardens\r\nplanned by our skilled architects, sun-dials are now springing afresh\r\nlike mushroom growth of a single night, and some are objects of the\r\ngreatest beauty and interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two Old Cronies, the Sun-dial and Bee Skepe.]\r\n\r\nIf the claims of antiquity and historical association have aught to\r\ncharm us, every sun-dial must be assured of our interest. The most\r\nprimitive mode of knowing of the midday hour was by a \"noon mark,\" a\r\ngroove cut or line drawn on door or window sill which indicated the\r\nmeridian hour through a shadow thrown on this noon mark. A good guess as\r\nto the hours near noon could be made by noting the distance of the\r\nshadow from the noon mark. I chanced to be near an old noon mark this\r\nsummer as the sun warned that noon approached; I noted that the marking\r\nshadow crossed the line at twenty minutes before noon by our\r\nwatches--which, I suppose, was near enough to satisfy our \"early to\r\nrise\" ancestors. Meridian lines were often traced with exactness on the\r\nfloors of churches in Continental Europe.\r\n\r\nAn advance step in accuracy and elegance was made when a simple metal\r\nsun-dial was affixed to the window sill instead of cutting the rude noon\r\nmark. Soon the sun-dial was set on a simple pedestal near the kitchen\r\nwindow, so that the active worker within might glance at the dial face\r\nwithout ceasing in her task. Such a sun-dial is shown on page 354, as it\r\nstands under the \"buttery\" window cosily hobnobbing with its old crony\r\nof many years, the bee skepe. One could wish to be a bee, and live in\r\nthat snug home under the Syringa bush.\r\n\r\nPortable sun-dials succeeded fixed dials; they have been known as long\r\nas the Christian era; shepherds' dials were the \"Kalendars\" or\r\n\"Cylindres\" about which treatises were written as early as the\r\nthirteenth century. They were small cylinders of wood or ivory, having\r\nat the top a kind of stopper with a hinged gnomon; they are still used\r\nin the Pyrenees. Pretty little \"ring-dials\" of brass, gold, or silver,\r\nare constructed on the same principle. The exquisitely wrought portable\r\ndial shown on this page is a very fine piece of workmanship, and must\r\nhave been costly. It is dated 1764, and is eleven inches in diameter. It\r\nis a perfect example of the advanced type of dial made in Italy, which\r\nhad a simpler form as early certainly as A.D. 300. The compass was added\r\nin the thirteenth century. The compass-needle is missing on this dial,\r\nits only blemish. The Italians excelled in dial-making; among their\r\ninteresting forms were the cross-shaped dials evidently a reliquary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portable Sun-dial.]\r\n\r\nPortable dials were used instead of watches. There is at the Washington\r\nheadquarters at Morristown a delicately wrought oval silver case, with\r\ncompass and sun-dial, which was carried by one of the French officers\r\nwho came here with Lafayette; George Washington owned and carried one.\r\n\r\nThe colonists came here from a land set with dials, whether they sailed\r\nfrom Holland or England. Charles I had a vast fancy for dials, and had\r\nthem placed everywhere; the finest and most curious was the splendid\r\nmaster dial placed in his private gardens at Whitehall; this had five\r\ndials set in the upper part, four in the four corners, and a great\r\nhorizontal concave dial; among these were scattered equinoctial dials,\r\nvertical dials, declining dials, polar dials, plane dials, cylindrical\r\ndials, triangular dials; each was inscribed with explanatory verses in\r\nLatin. Equally beautiful and intricate were the dials of Charles II, the\r\nmost marvellous being the vast pyramid dial bearing 271 different dial\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to learn of English sun-dials should read Mrs. Gatty's\r\n_Book of Sun-dials_, a massive and fascinating volume. No such extended\r\nrecord could be made of American sun-dials; but it pleases me that I\r\nknow of over two hundred sun-dials in America, chiefly old ones; that I\r\nhave photographs of many of them; that I have copies of many hundred\r\ndial mottoes, and also a very fair collection of the old dial faces, of\r\nvarious metals and sizes.\r\n\r\nI know of no public collection of sun-dials in America save that in the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, and that is not a large one. Several of our\r\nHistorical Societies own single sun-dials. In the Essex Institute is the\r\nsun-dial of Governor Endicott; another, shown on page 344, was once the\r\nproperty of my far-away grandfather, Jonathan Fairbanks; it is in the\r\nDedham Historical Society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial in Garden of Frederick J. Kingsbury, Esq.]\r\n\r\nAll forms of sun-dials are interesting. A simple but accurate one was\r\nset on Robins Island by the late Samuel Bowne Duryea, Esq., of Brooklyn.\r\nTaking the flagpole of the club house as a stylus, he laid the lines and\r\nfigures of the dial-face with small dark stones on a ground of\r\nlight-hued stones, all set firmly in the earth at the base of the pole.\r\nThus was formed, with the simplest materials, by one who ever strove to\r\ngive pleasure and stimulate knowledge in all around him, an object which\r\nnot only told the time o' the day, but afforded gratification, elicited\r\ninvestigation, and awakened sentiment in all who beheld it.\r\n\r\nA similar use of a vertical pole as a primitive gnomon for a sun-dial\r\nseems to have been common to many uncivilized peoples. In upper Egypt\r\nthe natives set up a palm rod in open ground, and arrange a circle of\r\nstones or pegs around it, calling it an _alka_, and thus mark the hours.\r\nThe ploughman leaves his buffalo standing in the furrow while he learns\r\nthe progress of time from this simple dial--and we recall the words of\r\nJob, \"As a servant earnestly desireth a shadow.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial at Morristown, New Jersey.]\r\n\r\nThe Labrador Indians, when on the hunt or the march, set an upright\r\nstick or spear in the snow, and draw the line of the shadow thus cast.\r\nThey then stalk on their way; and the women, heavily laden with\r\nprovisions, shelter, and fuel, come slowly along two or three hours\r\nlater, note the distance between the present shadow and the line drawn\r\nby their lords, and know at once whether they must gather up the stick\r\nor spear and hurry along, or can rest for a short time on their weary\r\nmarch. This is a primitive but exact chronometer.\r\n\r\nThere are serious objections to quoting from Charles Lamb: you are never\r\nwilling to end the transcription--you long to add just one phrase, one\r\nclause more. Then, too, the purity of the pearl which you choose seems\r\nto render duller than their wont the leaden sentences with which you\r\nenclose it as a setting. Still, who could write of sun-dials without\r\nchoosing to transcribe these words of Lamb's?\r\n\r\n     \"What a dead thing is a clock, with its ponderous embowelments of\r\n     lead or brass, its pert or solemn dulness of communication,\r\n     compared with the simple altar-like structure and silent\r\n     heart-language of the old dial! It stood as the garden god of\r\n     Christian gardens. Why is it almost everywhere banished? If its\r\n     business use be suspended by more elaborate inventions, its moral\r\n     uses, its beauty, might have pleaded for its continuance. It spoke\r\n     of moderate labors, of pleasures not protracted after sunset, of\r\n     temperance and good hours. It was the primitive clock, the horologe\r\n     of the first world. Adam could scarce have missed it in Paradise.\r\n     The 'shepherd carved it out quaintly in the sun,' and turning\r\n     philosopher by the very occupation, provided it with mottoes more\r\n     touching than tombstones.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yes, Toby! It's Three O'clock.]\r\n\r\nSun-dial mottoes still can be gathered by hundreds; and they are one\r\nrecord of a force in the development of our literate people. For it was\r\nlong after we had printing ere we had any general class of folk, who, if\r\nthey could read, read anything save the Bible. To many the knowledge of\r\nreading came from the deciphering of what has been happily termed the\r\nLiterature of the Bookless. This literature was placed that he who ran\r\nmight read; and its opening chapters were in the form of inscriptions\r\nand legends and mottoes which were placed, not only on buildings and\r\nwalls, and pillars and bridges, but on household furniture and table\r\nutensils.\r\n\r\nThe inscribing of mottoes on sun-dials appears to have sprung up with\r\ndial-making; and where could a strict moral lesson, a suggestive or\r\ninspiring thought, be better placed? Even the most heedless or\r\nindifferent passer-by, or the unwilling reader could not fail to see the\r\ninstructive words when he cast his glance to learn the time.\r\n\r\nThe mottoes were frequently in Latin, a few in Greek or Hebrew; but the\r\nold English mottoes seem the most appealing.\r\n\r\n    ABUSE ME NOT I DO NO ILL\r\n    I STAND TO SERVE THEE WITH GOOD WILL\r\n    AS CAREFUL THEN BE SURE THOU BE\r\n    TO SERVE THY GOD AS I SERVE THEE.\r\n\r\n    A CLOCK THE TIME MAY WRONGLY TELL\r\n    I NEVER IF THE SUN SHINE WELL.\r\n\r\n    AS A SHADOW SUCH IS LIFE.\r\n\r\n    I COUNT NONE BUT SUNNY HOURS.\r\n\r\n    BE THE DAY WEARY, BE THE DAY LONG\r\n    SOON IT SHALL RING TO EVEN SONG.\r\n\r\nScriptural verses have ever been favorites, especially passages from the\r\nPsalms: \"Man is like a thing of nought, his time passeth away like a\r\nshadow.\" \"My time is in Thy hand.\" \"Put not off from day to day.\" \"Oh,\r\nremember how short my time is.\" Some of the Latin mottoes are very\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Face of Dial at Sag Harbor, Long Island.]\r\n\r\nPoets have written special verses for sun-dials. These noble lines are\r\nby Walter Savage Landor:--\r\n\r\n    IN HIS OWN IMAGE THE CREATOR MADE,\r\n    HIS OWN PURE SUNBEAM QUICKENED THEE, O MAN!\r\n    THOU BREATHING DIAL! SINCE THE DAY BEGAN\r\n    THE PRESENT HOUR WAS EVER MARKED WITH SHADE.\r\n\r\nThe motto, _Horas non numero nisi serenas_, in various forms and\r\nlanguages, has ever been a favorite. From an old album I have received\r\nthis poem written by Professor S. F. B. Morse; there is a note with it\r\nin Professor Morse's handwriting, saying he saw the motto on a sun-dial\r\nat Worms:--\r\n\r\n    TO A. G. E.\r\n\r\n    _Horas non numero nisi serenas._\r\n\r\n    The sun when it shines in a clear cloudless sky\r\n      Marks the time on my disk in figures of light;\r\n    If clouds gather o'er me, unheeded they fly,\r\n      I note not the hours except they be bright.\r\n\r\n    So when I review all the scenes that have past\r\n      Between me and thee, be they dark, be they light,\r\n    I forget what was dark, the light I hold fast;\r\n      I note not the hours except they be bright.\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL F. B. MORSE,\r\n    Washington, March, 1845.\r\n\r\nThe sun-dial seems too classic an object, and too serious a teacher, to\r\nbear a jesting motto. This sober pun was often seen:--\r\n\r\n    LIFE'S BUT A SHADOWE\r\n      MAN'S BUT DUST\r\n    THIS DYALL SAYES\r\n      DY ALL WE MUST.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial in Garden of Grace Church Rectory, New York.]\r\n\r\nThe sun-dial does not lure to \"idle dalliance.\" Nine-tenths of the\r\nsun-dial mottoes tersely warn you not to linger, to haste away, that\r\ntime is fleeting, and your hours are numbered, and therefore to \"be\r\nabout your business.\" In a single moment and at a single glance the\r\nsun-dial has said its lesson, has told its absolute message, and there\r\nis no reason for you to gaze at it longer. Its very position, too, in\r\nthe unshaded rays of the sun, does not invite you to long companionship,\r\nas do the shady lengths of a pergola, or a green orchard seat. Still, I\r\nwould ever have a garden seat near a sun-dial, especially when it is a\r\nwork of art to be studied, and with mottoes to be remembered. For even\r\nin hurrying America the sun-dial seems--like a guide-post--a half-human\r\nthing, for which we can feel an almost personal interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fugio Bank-note.]\r\n\r\nThe figure of a sun-dial played an interesting part in the early history\r\nof the United States. In the first set of notes issued for currency by\r\nthe American Congress was one for the value of one third of a dollar.\r\nOne side has the chain of links bearing the names of the thirteen\r\nstates, enclosing a sunburst bearing the words, _American Congress, We\r\nare One_. The reverse side is shown on this page. It bears a print of a\r\nsun-dial, with the motto, _Fugio, Mind Your Business_. The so-called\r\n\"Franklin cent\" has a similar design of a sun-dial with the same motto,\r\nand there was a beautiful \"Fugio dollar\" cast in silver, bronze, and\r\npewter. Though this design and motto were evidently Franklin's taste,\r\nthe motto in its use on a sun-dial was not original with Franklin, nor\r\nwith any one else in the Congress, for it had been seen on dials on many\r\nEnglish churches and houses. In the form, \"Begone about Your Business,\"\r\nit was on a house in the Inner Temple; this is the tradition of the\r\norigin of this motto. The dialler sent for a motto to place under the\r\ndial, as he had been instructed by the Benchers; when the man arrived at\r\nthe Library, he found but one surly old gentleman poring over a musty\r\nbook. To him he said, \"Please, sir, the gentlemen told me to call this\r\nhour for a motto for the sun-dial.\" \"Begone about your business,\" was\r\nthe testy answer. So the man painted the words under the dial; and the\r\nchance words seemed so appropriate to the Benchers that they were never\r\nremoved. It is told of Dean Cotton of Bangor that he had a cross old\r\ngardener who always warded off unwelcome visitors to the deanery by\r\nsaying to every one who approached, \"Go about your business!\" After the\r\ngardener's death the dean had this motto engraved around the sun-dial in\r\nthe garden, \"Goa bou tyo urb us in ess, 1838.\" Thus the gardener's growl\r\nbecame his epitaph. Another form was, \"Be about Your Business,\" and it\r\nis a suggestive fact that it was on a dial on the General Post-office in\r\nLondon in 1756. Franklin's interest in and knowledge of postal matters,\r\nhis long residence in London, and service under the crown as American\r\npostmaster general, must have familiarized him with this dial, and I am\r\nconvinced it furnished to him the notion for the design on the first\r\nbank-note and coins of the new nation.\r\n\r\nAn interesting bit of history allied to America is given to us in the\r\nfinding of a sun-dial which gives to American students of heraldic\r\nantiquities another dated shield of the Washington \"stars and stripes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial at \"Washington House,\" Little Brington,\r\nEngland.]\r\n\r\nIn Little Brington, Northamptonshire, stands a house known as \"The\r\nWashington House,\" which gave shelter to the Washingtons of Sulgrave\r\nafter the fall of their fortunes. Within a stone's throw of the house\r\nhas recently been found a sun-dial having the Washington arms (argent)\r\ntwo bars, and in chief three mullets (gules) carved upon it, with the\r\ndate 1617. The existence of this stone has been known for forty years;\r\nbut it has never been closely examined and noted till recently. It is a\r\ncircular slab of sandstone three inches thick and sixteen inches in\r\ndiameter. The gnomon is lacking. The lines, figures, and shield are\r\nincised, and the letters R. W. can be dimly seen. These were probably\r\nthe initials of Robert Washington, great uncle of the two emigrants to\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dial-face from Mount Vernon.]\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Mr. A. L. Y. Morley, a faithful antiquary of\r\nGreat Barrington, I have the pleasure of giving, on page 367, a\r\nrepresentation of this interesting dial. It is shown leaning against\r\nthe \"pump-stand\" in the yard of the \"Washington House\"; and the pump\r\nseems as ancient as the dial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial of Mary Washington, Fredericksburg, Virginia.]\r\n\r\nIn this book are three other sun-dials associated with George\r\nWashington. At Mount Vernon there stands at the front of the entrance\r\ndoor a modern sun-dial. The fine old metal dial-face, about ten inches\r\nin diameter, which in Washington's day was placed on the same site, is\r\nnow the property of Mr. William F. Havemeyer, Jr., of New York. It was\r\ngiven to him by Mr. Custis; a picture of it is shown on page 368. This\r\ndial-face is a splendid relic; one closely associated with Washington's\r\neveryday life, and full of suggestion and sentiment to every thoughtful\r\nbeholder. The sun-dial which stood in the old Fredericksburg garden of\r\nMary Washington, the mother of George Washington, still stands in\r\nFredericksburg, in the grounds of Mr. Doswell. A photograph of it is\r\nreproduced on page 369. The fourth historic dial is on page 371. It is\r\nthe one at Kenmore, the home built by Fielding Lewis for his bride,\r\nBetty Washington, the sister of George Washington, on ground adjoining\r\nher mother's home. A part of the garden which connected these two\r\nWashington homes is shown on page 228. These three American sun-dials\r\nafford an interesting proof of the universal presence of sun-dials in\r\nVirginian homes of wealth, and they also show the kind of dial-face\r\nwhich was generally used. Another ancient dial (page 350) at Travellers'\r\nRest, a near-by Virginian country seat, is similar in shape to these\r\nthree, and differs but little in mounting.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania and Virginia sun-dials have lingered in use in front of\r\ncourt-houses, on churches, and in a few old garden dials. In New England\r\nI scarcely know an old garden dial still standing in its original place\r\non its original pedestal. Four old ones of brass or pewter are shown in\r\nthe illustration on page 379. These once stood in New England gardens or\r\non the window sills of old houses; one was taken from a sunny window\r\nledge to give to me.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the attention paid the doings of the American Philosophical\r\nSociety, and the number of scientists living near Philadelphia, may\r\naccount for the many sun-dials set up in the vicinity of the town.\r\nGodfrey, the maker of Godfrey's Quadrant, was one of those scientific\r\ninvestigators, and must have been a famous \"dialler.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kenmore, the Home of Betty Washington Lewis.]\r\n\r\nOn page 373 is shown an ancient sun-dial in the garden of Charles F.\r\nJenkins, Esq., in Germantown, Pennsylvania. This sun-dial originally\r\nbelonged to Nathan Spencer, who lived in Germantown prior to and during\r\nthe Revolutionary War. Hepzibah Spencer, his daughter, married, and took\r\nthe sun-dial to Byberry. Her daughter carried the sun-dial to Gwynedd\r\nwhen her name was changed to Jenkins; and their grandson, the present\r\nowner, rescued it from the chicken house with the gnomon missing, which\r\nwas afterward found. Its inscription, \"Time waits for No Man,\" is an old\r\npunning device on the word gnomon.\r\n\r\nAt one time dialling was taught by many a country schoolmaster, and\r\nexcellent and accurate sun-dials were made and set up by country\r\nworkmen, usually masons of slight education. In Scotland the making of\r\nsun-dials has never died out. In America many pewter sun-dials were cast\r\nin moulds of steatite or other material. A few dial-makers still remain;\r\none in lower New York makes very interesting-looking sun-dials of brass,\r\nwhich, properly discolored and stained, find a ready sale in uptown\r\nshops. I doubt if these are ever made for any special geographical\r\npoint, but there is in a small Pennsylvania town an old Quaker who makes\r\ncarefully calculated and accurate sun-dials, computed by logarithms for\r\nspecial places. I should like to see him \"sit like a shepherd carving\r\nout dials, quaintly point by point.\" I have a very pretty circular brass\r\ndial of his making, about eight inches in diameter. He writes me that\r\n\"the dial sent thee is a good students' dial, fit to set outside the\r\nwindow for a young man to use and study by in college,\" which would\r\nindicate to me that my Quaker dialler knows another type of collegian\r\nfrom those of my acquaintance, who would find the time set by a sun-dial\r\nrather slow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial in Garden of Charles F. Jenkins, Esq.,\r\nGermantown, Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nThere have been those who truly loved sun-dials. Sir William Temple\r\nordered that after his death his heart should be buried under the\r\nsun-dial in his garden--where his heart had been in life. 'Tis not\r\nunusual to see a sun-dial over the gate to a burial ground, and a noble\r\nemblem it is in that place; one at Mount Auburn Cemetery, near Boston,\r\nbears a pleasing motto written originally by John G. Whittier for his\r\nfriend, Dr. Henry Ingersoll Bowditch, and inscribed on a beautiful\r\nsilver sun-dial now owned by Dr. Vincent Y. Bowditch of Boston,\r\nMassachusetts. A facsimile of this dial was also placed before the Manor\r\nHouse on the island of Naushon by Mr. John M. Forbes in memory of Dr.\r\nBowditch. The lines run thus:--\r\n\r\n    WITH WARNING HAND I MARK TIME'S RAPID FLIGHT\r\n    FROM LIFE'S GLAD MORNING TO ITS SOLEMN NIGHT.\r\n    YET, THROUGH THE DEAR GOD'S LOVE I ALSO SHOW\r\n    THERE'S LIGHT ABOVE ME, BY THE SHADE BELOW.\r\n\r\nA sun-dial is to me, in many places, a far more inspiring memorial than\r\na monument or tablet. Let me give as an example the fine sun-dial,\r\ndesigned by W. Gedney Beatty, Esq., and shown on page 359, which was\r\nerected on the grounds of the Memorial Hospital at Morristown, New\r\nJersey, by the Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, to\r\nmark the spot where Washington partook of the Communion.\r\n\r\nWhat dignified and appropriate church appointments sun-dials are. A\r\nsimple and impressive bronze vertical dial on the wall of the Dutch\r\nReformed Church on West End Avenue, New York, is shown on page 346. The\r\nsun-dial standing before the rectory of Grace Church on Broadway, New\r\nYork, is on page 364.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial at Ophir Farm, White Plains, New York,\r\nCountry-seat of Hon. Whitelaw Reid.]\r\n\r\nThere is ever much question as to a suitable pedestal for garden\r\nsun-dials: it must not stand so high that the dial-face cannot be looked\r\ndown upon by grown persons; it must not be so light as to seem rickety,\r\nnor so heavy as to be clumsy. A very good rule is to err on the side of\r\nsimplicity in sun-dials for ordinary gardens. What I regard as a very\r\nsatisfactory pedestal and mounting in every particular may be seen in\r\nthe illustration facing page 80, showing the sun-dial in the garden of\r\nCharles E. Mather, Esq., at Avonwood Court, Haverford, Pennsylvania.\r\nSometimes the pillars of old balustrades, old fence posts, and even\r\nparts of old tombs and monuments, have been used as pedestals for\r\nsun-dials. How pleasantly Sylvana in her _Letters to an Unknown Friend_,\r\ntells us and shows to us her cheerful sun-dial mounted on the four\r\ncorners of an old tombstone with this fine motto cut into the upper\r\nstep, _Lux et umbra vicissim sed semper amor_. I mean to search the\r\nstone-cutters' waste heap this summer and see whether I cannot rob the\r\ngrave to mark the hours of my life. Charles Dickens had at Gadshill a\r\nsun-dial set on one of the pillars of the balustrade of Old Rochester\r\nBridge. From Italy and Greece marble pillars have been sent from ancient\r\nruins to be set up as dial pedestals.\r\n\r\nIf possible, the pedestal as well as the dial-face of a handsome\r\nsun-dial should have some significance through association, suggestion,\r\nor history. At Ophir Farm, White Plains, New York, the country-seat of\r\nHon. Whitelaw Reid, may be seen a sun-dial full of exquisite\r\nsignificance. It is shown on page 375. The signs of the Zodiac in finely\r\ndesigned bronze are set on the symmetrical marble pedestal, and seem\r\nwonderfully harmonious and appropriate. This sun-dial is a literal\r\nexemplification of the words of Emerson:--\r\n\r\n              \"A calendar\r\n    Exact to days, exact to hours,\r\n    Counted on the spacious dial\r\n    Yon broidered Zodiac girds.\"\r\n\r\nThe dial-face is upheld by a carefully modelled tortoise in bronze,\r\nwhich is an equally suggestive emblem, connected with the tradition,\r\nfolk-lore, and religious beliefs of both primitive and cultured peoples;\r\nit is specially full of meaning in this place. The whole sun-dial shows\r\nmuch thought and aesthetic perception in the designer and owner, and\r\ncannot fail to prove gratifying to all observers having either\r\nsensibility or judgment.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a very unusual and beautiful sun-dial standard may be seen,\r\nlike the one in the Rose garden at Yaddo, Saratoga, New York, a copy of\r\nrarely beautiful Pompeian carvings. A representation of this is shown on\r\npage 86. Copies of simpler antique carvings make excellent sun-dial\r\npedestals; a safe rule to follow is to have a reproduction made of some\r\nwell-proportioned English or Scotch pedestal. The latter are well suited\r\nto small gardens. I have drawings of several Scotch sun-dials and\r\npedestals which would be charming in American gardens. In the gardens at\r\nHillside, by the side of the Shakespeare Border is a sun-dial (page 378)\r\nwhich is an exact reproduction of the one in the garden at Abbotsford,\r\nthe home of Sir Walter Scott. This pedestal is suited to its\r\nsurroundings, is well proportioned; and has historic interest. It forms\r\nan excellent example of Charles Lamb's \"garden-altar.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial at Hillside, Menand's, near Albany, New York.]\r\n\r\nOn a lawn or in any suitable spot the dial-face can be mounted on a\r\nboulder; one is here shown. I prefer a pedestal. For gardens of limited\r\nsize, much simplicity of design is more pleasing and more fitting than\r\nany elaborate carving. In an Italian garden, or in any formal garden\r\nwhose work in stone or marble is costly and artistic, the sun-dial\r\npedestal should be the climax in richness of carving of all the garden\r\nfurnishing. I like the pedestal set on a little platform, so two or\r\nthree steps may be taken up to it from the garden level; but after all,\r\nno rules can be given for the dial's setting. It may be planted with\r\nvines, or stand unornamented; it may be set low, and be looked down\r\nupon, or it may be raised high up on a side wall; but wherever it is, it\r\nmust not be for a single minute in shadow; no trees or overhanging\r\nshrubs should be near it; it is a child of the sun, and lives only in\r\nthe sun's full rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Brass and Pewter Dial-faces.]\r\n\r\nIn the lovely old garden at the home of Frederick J. Kingsbury, Esq., at\r\nWaterbury, Conn., is a sun-dial bearing the motto, \"_Horas non numero\r\nnisi serenas_,\" and the dates 1739-1751,--the dates of the building of\r\nthe old and new houses on land that has been in the immediate family\r\nsince 1739. Around this dial is a crescent-shaped bed of Zinnias, and\r\nvery satisfactory do they prove. This garden has fine Box edgings; one\r\nis shown on page 173, a Box walk, set in 1851 with ancient Box brought\r\nfrom the garden of Mr. Kingsbury's great-great-grandfather.\r\n\r\nThe gnomon of a sun-dial is usually a simple plate of metal in the\r\ngeneral shape of a right-angled triangle, cut often in some pierced\r\ndesign, and occasionally inscribed with a motto, name, or date.\r\nSometimes the dial-maker placed on the gnomon various Masonic\r\nsymbols--the compass, square, and triangle, or the coat of arms of the\r\ndial owner.\r\n\r\nOne old English dial fitting we have never copied in America. It was the\r\ntaste of the days of the Stuart kings, days of constant jesting and\r\namusement and practical jokes. Concealed water jets were placed which\r\nwet the clothing of the unwary one who lingered to consult the\r\ndial-face.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the sun-dial, as well as its classicism, was sure to\r\nbe felt by artists. In the paintings of Holbein, of Albert Duerer, dials\r\nmay be seen, not idly painted, but with symbolic meaning. The mystic\r\nimport of a sun-dial is shown in full effect in that perfect picture,\r\n_Beata Beatrix_, by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. I have chosen to show here\r\n(facing page 380) the _Beata Beatrix_ owned by Charles L. Hutchinson,\r\nEsq., of Chicago, as being less photographed and known than the one of\r\nthe British Gallery, from which it varies slightly and also because it\r\nhas the beautiful predella. In this picture, in the words of its\r\npoet-painter:--\r\n\r\n    \"Love's Hour stands.\r\n            Its eyes invisible\r\n     Watch till the dial's thin brown shade\r\n     Be born--yea, till the journeying line be laid\r\n     Upon the point.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Beata Beatrix.]\r\n\r\nAndrew Marvell wrote two centuries ago of the floral sun-dials which\r\nwere the height of the gardening mode of his day:--\r\n\r\n      \"How well the skilful gardener drew\r\n       Of flowers and herbs this dial new.\r\n       When from above the milder sun\r\n       Does through a fragrant zodiac run;\r\n       And as it works the industrious bee\r\n       Computes its time as well as we!\r\n    How could such sweet and wholesome hours\r\n    Be reckoned but with herbs and flowers!\"\r\n\r\nThese were sometimes set of diverse flowers, sometimes of Mallows. Two\r\nof growing Box are described and displayed in the chapter on Box\r\nedgings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Faithful Gardener.]\r\n\r\nLinnaeus made a list of forty-six flowers which constituted what he\r\ntermed the Horologe or Watch of Flora, and he gave what he called their\r\nexact hours of rising and setting. He divided them into three classes:\r\nMeteoric, Tropical, and Equinoctial flowers. Among those which he named\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n  ===========================================================\r\n                             | OPENING HOUR. | CLOSING HOUR.\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Dandelion                  |    5-6 A.M.   |    8-9 P.M.\r\n  Mouse-ear Hawkweed         |      8 A.M.   |      2 P.M.\r\n  Sow Thistle                |      5 A.M.   |  11-12 P.M.\r\n  Yellow Goat-beard          |    3-5 A.M.   |   9-10 (?)\r\n  White Water Lily           |      7 A.M.   |      7 P.M.\r\n  Day Lily                   |      5 A.M.   |    7-8 P.M.\r\n  Convolvulus                |    5-6 A.M.   |\r\n  Mallow                     |   9-10 A.M.   |\r\n  Pimpernel                  |    7-8 A.M.   |\r\n  Portulaca                  |   9-10 A.M.   |\r\n  Pink (_Dianthus prolifer_) |      8 A.M.   |      1 P.M.\r\n  Succory                    |    4-5 A.M.   |\r\n  Calendula                  |      7 A.M.   |    3-4 P.M.\r\n  ===========================================================\r\n\r\nOf course these hours would vary in this country. And I must say very\r\nfrankly that I think we should always be behind time if we trusted to\r\nFlora's Horologe. This floral clock of Linnaeus was calculated for\r\nUpsala, Sweden; De Candolle gave another for Paris, and one has been\r\narranged for our Eastern states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nGARDEN FURNISHINGS\r\n\r\n     \"Furnished with whatever may make the place agreeable, melancholy,\r\n     and country-like.\"\r\n\r\n     --_Forest Trees_, JOHN EVELYN, 1670.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuaint old books of garden designers show us that much more was\r\ncontained in a garden two centuries ago, than now; it had many more\r\nadjuncts, more furnishings; a very full list of them has been given by\r\nBatty Langley in his _New Principles of Gardening_, etc., 1728. Some\r\nseem amusing--as haystacks and woodpiles, which he terms \"rural\r\nenrichments.\" Of water adornments there were to be purling streams,\r\nbasins, canals, fountains, cascades, cold baths. There were to be\r\naviaries, hare warrens, pheasant grounds, partridge grounds, dove-cotes,\r\nbeehives, deer paddocks, sheep walks, cow pastures, and \"manazeries\"\r\n(menageries?); physic gardens, orchards, bowling-greens, hop gardens,\r\norangeries, melon grounds, vineyards, parterres, fruit yards, nurseries,\r\nsun-dials, obelisks, statues, cabinets, etc., decorated the garden\r\nwalks. There were to be land gradings of mounts, winding valleys, dales,\r\nterraces, slopes, borders, open plains, labyrinths, wildernesses,\r\n\"serpentine meanders,\" \"rude-coppices,\" precipices, amphitheatres. His\r\n\"serpentine meanders\" had large opening spaces at proper distances, in\r\none of which might be placed a small fruit garden, a \"cone of\r\nevergreens,\" or a \"Paradice-Stocks,\"--about which latter mysterious\r\ngarden adornment I think we must be content to remain in ignorance,\r\nsince he certainly has given us ample variety to choose from without it.\r\n\r\nOther \"landscapists\" placed in their gardens old ruins, misshapen rocks,\r\nand even dead trees, in order to look \"natural.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1608 Henry Ballard brought out _The Gardener's Labyrinth_--a pretty\r\ngood book, shut away from the most of us by being printed in black\r\nletter. He says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The framing of sundry herbs delectable, with waies and allies\r\n     artfully devised is an upright herbar.\"\r\n\r\nHerbars, or arbors, were of two kinds: an upright arbor, which was\r\nmerely a covered lean-to attached to a fence or wall; and a winding or\r\n\"arch-arbor\" standing alone. He names \"archherbs,\" which are simply\r\nclimbing vines to set \"winding in arch-manner on withie poles.\" \"Walker\r\nand sitters there-under\" are thereby comfortably protected from the heat\r\nof the sun. These upright arbors were in high favor; Ballard says they\r\noffered \"fragrant savours, delectable sights, and sharpening of the\r\nmemory.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Garden Lyre at Waterford, Virginia.]\r\n\r\nTree arbors were in use in Elizabethan times, platforms built in the\r\nbranches of large trees. Parkinson called one that would hold fifty men,\r\n\"the goodliest spectacle that ever his eyes beheld.\" A distinction was\r\nmade between arbors and bowers. The arbor might be round or square, and\r\nwas domed over the top; while the long arched way was a bower. In our\r\nSouthern states that special use of the word bower is still universal,\r\nespecially in the term Rose bowers. A quaint and universal furnishing of\r\nold Southern gardens were the trellises known as garden lyres. Two are\r\nshown in this chapter, from Waterford, Virginia; one bearing little\r\nfoliage and another embowered in vines, in order to show what a really\r\ngood vine support they were. Garden lyres and Rose bowers are rotting on\r\nthe ground in old Virginia gardens, and I fear they will never be\r\nreplaced.\r\n\r\nThe word pergola was seldom heard here a century ago, save as used by\r\nthe few who had travelled in Italy; but pergolas were to be found in\r\nmany an old American garden. An ancient oval pergola still stands at\r\nArlington, that beautiful spot which was once the home of the Virginia\r\nLees, and is now the home of the honored dead of our Civil War. This old\r\npergola has remained unharmed through fierce conflict, and is wreathed\r\neach spring with the verdure of vines of many kinds. It is twenty feet\r\nwide between the pillars, and forms an oval one hundred feet long and\r\nseventy wide, and when in full greenery is a lovely thing. It was\r\ncalled--indeed it is still termed in the South--a \"green gallery,\" a\r\nword and thing of mediaeval days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Virginia Lyre with Vines.]\r\n\r\nThere are many pretty trellises and vine supports and arbors which can\r\nbe made of light poles and rails, but I do not like to hear the\r\npretentious name, pergola, applied to them. A pergola must not be a\r\nmean, light-built affair. It should be of good proportions and\r\nsubstantial materials. It need not be made with brick or marble pillars;\r\nnatural tree trunks of good size serve as well. It should look as if it\r\nhad been built with care and stability, and that the vines had been\r\nplanted and trained by skilled gardeners. A pergola may have a\r\ndilapidated Present and be endurable; but it should show evidences of a\r\nsubstantial Past.\r\n\r\nLittle sisters of the pergola are the _charmilles_, or bosquets, arches\r\nof growing trees, whose interlaced boughs have no supports of wood as\r\nhave the pergolas. When these arches are carefully trained and pruned,\r\nand the ground underneath is laid with turf or gravel, they form a\r\ndelightful shady walk.\r\n\r\nCharming covered ways can be easily made by polling and training Plum or\r\nWillow trees. Arches are far too rare in American gardens. The few we\r\nhave are generally old ones. In Mrs. Pierson's garden in Salem the\r\nsplendid arch of Buckthorn is a hundred and twenty five years old.\r\nSimilar ones are at Indian Hill. Cedar was an old choice for hedges and\r\narches. It easily winter-kills at the base, and that is ample reason for\r\nits rejection and disuse.\r\n\r\nThe many garden seats of the old English garden were perhaps its chief\r\nfeature in distinction from American garden furnishings to-day. In a\r\nletter written from Kenilworth in 1575 the writer told of garden seats\r\nwhere he sat in the heat of summer, \"feeling the pleasant whisking\r\nwynde.\" I have walked through many a large modern garden in the summer\r\nheat, and longed in vain for a shaded seat from which to regard for a\r\nfew moments the garden treasures and feel the whisking wind, and would\r\ngladly have made use of the temporary presence of a wheelbarrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Iron Gate at Westover-on-James.]\r\n\r\nSeats of marble and stone are in many of our modern formal gardens; a\r\npretty one is in the garden at Avonwood Court.\r\n\r\nGrottoes, arbors, and summer-houses were all of importance in those\r\ndays, when in our latitude and climate men had not thought to build\r\npiazzas surrounding the house and shadowing all the ground floor rooms.\r\nWe are beginning to think anew of the value of sunlight in the parlors\r\nand dining rooms of our summer homes, which for the past thirty or forty\r\nyears have been so darkened by our wide piazzas. Now we have fewer\r\npiazzas and more peristyles, and soon we shall have summer-houses and\r\ngarden houses also.\r\n\r\nThere are preserved in the South, in spite of war and earthquake, a\r\nnumber of fine examples of old wrought-iron garden gates. King William\r\nof England introduced these artistic gates into England, and they were\r\nthe height of garden fashion. Among them were the beautiful gates still\r\nat Hampton Court, and those of Bulwich, Northamptonshire. They were\r\ncalled _clair-voyees_ on account of the uninterrupted view they\r\npermitted to those without and within the walls. These were often\r\npainted blue; but in America they were more sober of tint, though\r\nportions were gilded. One of the old gates at Westover-on-James is here\r\nshown, and on page 390 the rich wrought-iron work in the courtyard at\r\nthe home of Colonel Colt in Bristol, Rhode Island. This is as fine as\r\nthe house, and that is a splendid example of the best work of the first\r\nyears of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nFountains were seen usually in handsome gardens in the South; simple\r\nwater jets falling in a handsome basin of marble or stone. Statuary of\r\nmarble or lead was never common in old American gardens, though\r\npretentious gardens had examples. To-day, in our carefully thought-out\r\ngardens, the garden statuary is a thing of beauty and often of meaning,\r\nas the figure shown on page 84. Usually our statues are of marble,\r\nsometimes a Japanese bronze is seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Iron-work in Court of Colt Mansion, Bristol, Rhode\r\nIsland.]\r\n\r\nIn the old black letter _Gardener's Labyrinth_, a very full description\r\nis given of old modes of watering a garden. There was a primitive and\r\nvery limited system of irrigation, the water being raised by\r\n\"well-swipes\"; there were very handy puncheons, or tubs on wheels, which\r\ncould be trundled down the garden walk. There was also a formidable\r\n\"Great Squirt of Tin,\" which was said to take \"mighty strength\" to\r\nhandle, and which looked like a small cannon; with it was an ingenious\r\nbent tube of tin by which the water could be thrown in \"great droppes\"\r\nlike a fountain. The author says of ordinary means of garden watering:--\r\n\r\n     \"The common Watring Pot with us hath a narrow Neck, a Big Belly,\r\n     Somewhat large Bottome, and full of little holes with a proper hole\r\n     forced in the head to take in the water; which filled full and the\r\n     Thumbe laid on the hole to keep in the aire may in such wise be\r\n     carried in handsome Manner.\"\r\n\r\nGarden tools have changed but little since Tudor days; spade and rake\r\nwere like ours to-day, so were dibble and mattock. Even grafting and\r\npruning tools, shown in books of husbandry, were surprisingly like our\r\nown. Scythes were much heavier and clumsier. An old fellow is here shown\r\nsharpening in the ancient manner a scythe about three hundred years old.\r\n\r\nThe art of grafting, known since early days, formed an important part of\r\nthe gardener's craft. Large share of ancient garden treatises is devoted\r\nto minute instructions therein. To this day in New England towns a good\r\ngrafter is a local autocrat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Summer-house at Ravensworth.]\r\n\r\nBeehives were once found in every garden; bee-skepes they were called\r\nwhen made of straw. Picturesque and homely were the old straw beehives,\r\nand still are they used in England; the old one shown in the chapter on\r\nsun-dials can scarcely be mated in America. They served as a\r\nconventional emblem of industry. They were made of welts or ropes of\r\ntwisted straw, as were the heavy winnowing skepes once used for\r\nwinnowing grain. In Maine, in a few out-of-the-way communities, ancient\r\nmen still winnow grain with these skepes. I saw a man last autumn, a\r\ngiant in stature, standing in a dull light on the crown of a hill\r\nwinnowing wheat in one of these great skepes with an indescribably\r\nfree and noble gesture. He was a classic, a relic of Homer's age, no\r\nlonger a farmer, but a husbandman. Bees and honey were of much value in\r\nancient days. Honey was the chief ingredient in many wholesome and\r\npleasing drinks--mead, metheglin, bragget (or braket), morat,\r\nerboule--all very delightful in their ingredients, redolent of meadows\r\nand hedge-rows; thus Cowslip mead was made of Cowslip \"pips,\" honey,\r\nLemon juice, and \"a handful of Sweetbrier.\" \"Athol porridge,\" demure of\r\nname, was as potent as pleasing--potent as good honey, good cream, and\r\ngood whiskey could make it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sharpening the Old Dutch Scythe.]\r\n\r\nRows of typical Southern beehives are shown in the two succeeding\r\nillustrations. From their home by the side of a White Rose and under an\r\nold Sweet Apple tree these Waterford bees did not wish to swarm out in a\r\nhurry to find a new home. These beehives are not very ancient in shape,\r\nbut when I see a row of them set thus under the trees, or in a\r\nhive-shelter, they seem to tell of olden days. The very bees flying in\r\nand out seem steady-going, respectable old fellows. Such hives have a\r\ncosy look, with rows of Hollyhocks behind them, and hundreds of spires\r\nof Larkspur for these old bees to bury their heads in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Beehives at Waterford, Virginia.]\r\n\r\nThe sadly picturesque old superstition of \"telling the bees\" of a death\r\nin a family and hanging a bit of black cloth on the hives as a\r\nmourning-weed still is observed in some country communities. Whittier's\r\npoem on the subject is wonderfully \"countrified\" in atmosphere, using\r\nthe word chore-girl, so seldom heard even in familiar speech to-day and\r\nnever found in verse elsewhere than in this rustic poem. I saw one\r\nsummer in Narragansett, on Stony Lane, not far from the old\r\nSix-Principle Church, a row of beehives hung with strips of black cloth;\r\nthe house mistress was dead--the friend of bird and beast and bee--who\r\nhad reared the guardian of the garden told of on page 396 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Beehives under the Trees.]\r\n\r\nA pretty and appropriate garden furnishing was the dove-cote. The\r\npossession of a dove-cote in England, and the rearing of pigeons, was\r\nfree only to lords of the manor and noblemen. When the colonists came to\r\nAmerica, many of them had never been permitted to keep pigeons. In\r\nScotland persistent attempts at pigeon-raising by folks of humble\r\nstation might be punished with death. The settlers must have revelled in\r\nthe freedom of the new land, as well as in the plenty of pigeons, both\r\nwild and domestic. In old England the dove-cote was often built close to\r\nthe kitchen door, that squab and pigeon might be near the hand of the\r\ncook. Dove-cotes in America were often simple boxes or houses raised on\r\nstout posts. Occasionally might be seen a fine brick dove-cote like the\r\none still standing at Shirley-on-the-James, in Virginia, which is shaped\r\nwithout and within like several famous old dove-cotes in England, among\r\nthem the one at Athelhampton Hall, Dorchester, England. The English\r\ndove-cote has within a revolving ladder hung from a central post while\r\nthe Virginian squab catcher uses an ordinary ladder. The shelves for the\r\nbirds to rest upon and the square recesses for the nests made by the\r\ningenious placing of the bricks are alike in both cotes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spring House at Johnson Homestead, Germantown,\r\nPennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nA beautiful and fitting tenant of old formal gardens was the peacock,\r\n\"with his aungelis federys bryghte.\" On large English estates peacocks\r\nwere universally kept. A fine peacock, with full-spread tail, makes many\r\na gay flower bed pale before his panoply of iridescence and color. The\r\npeahen is a demurely pretty creature. Peacocks are not altogether\r\ngrateful to garden owners; on the old Narragansett farm whose garden is\r\nshown on page 35, they were always kept, and it was one of the prides\r\nand pleasures of formal hospitality to offer a roasted peacock to\r\nvisitors. But, save when roasted, the vain creatures would not keep\r\nsilence, and when they squawked the glory of their plumage was\r\nforgotten. They had an odious habit, too, of wandering off to distant\r\ngroves on the farm, usually selecting the nights of bitterest cold, and\r\nroosting in some very high tree, in some very inaccessible spot. They\r\ncould not be left in this ill-considered sleeping-place, else they would\r\nall freeze to death; and words fail to tell the labor in lowering\r\ntwilight and temperature of discovering their retreat, the dislodging,\r\ncapturing, and imprisoning them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dove-cote at Shirley-on-James.]\r\n\r\nIn Narragansett there is a charming old farm garden, which I often visit\r\nto note and admire its old-time blossoms. This garden has a guardian,\r\nwho haunts the garden walks as did the terrace peacock of old England;\r\nno watch-dog ever was so faithful, and none half so acute. When I visit\r\nthe garden I always ask \"Where is Job?\" I am answered that he is in the\r\nfield with the cattle. Sometimes this is true, but at other times Job\r\nhas left the field and is attending to his assumed duties. As he is not\r\nencouraged, he has learned great slyness and dissimulation. Immovable,\r\nand in silence, Job is concealed behind a Syringa hedge or in a Lilac\r\nambush, and as you stroll peacefully and unwittingly down the paths,\r\nsniffing the honeyed sweetness of the dense edging of Sweet Alyssum, all\r\nis as balmy as the blossoms. But stoop for an instant, to gather some\r\nleaves of Sweet Basil or Sweet Brier, or to collect a dozen seed-pods of\r\nthat specially delicate Sweet Pea, and lo! the enemy is upon you,\r\nlike a fierce whirlwind. He looks mild and demure enough in his kitchen\r\nyard retreat, whereto, upon piercing outcry for help, the farmer and his\r\ntwo sons have haled him, and where the camera has caught him. But far\r\nfrom meek is his aspect when you are dodging him around the great Tree\r\nPeony, or flying frantically before him down the side path to the garden\r\ngate. This fierce wild beast was once that mildest of creatures--a pet\r\nlamb; the constant companion of the farm-wife, as she weeded and watered\r\nher loved garden. Her husband says, \"He seems to think folks are\r\nstealing her flowers, if they stop to look.\" The wife and mother of\r\nthese three great men has gone from her garden forever; but a tenderness\r\nfor all that she loved makes them not only care for her flowers, but\r\nkeeps this rampant guardian of the garden at the kitchen door, just as\r\nshe kept him when he was a little lamb. I knew this New England farmer's\r\nwife, a noble woman, of infinite tenderness, strength, and endurance; a\r\nlover of trees and flowers and all living things, and I marvel not that\r\nthey keep her memory green.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Peacock in His Pride.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nGARDEN BOUNDARIES\r\n\r\n    \"A garden fair ... with Wandis long and small\r\n     Railed about, and so with trees set\r\n     Was all the place; and Hawthorne hedges knet,\r\n     That lyf was none walking there forbye\r\n     That might within scarce any wight espy.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Kings Qubair_, KING JAMES I OF SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne who reads what I have written in these pages of a garden enclosed,\r\nwill scarcely doubt that to me every garden must have boundaries,\r\ndefinite and high. Three old farm boundaries were of necessity garden\r\nboundaries in early days--our stone walls, rail fences, and hedge-rows.\r\nThe first two seem typically American; the third is an English hedge\r\nfashion. Throughout New England the great boulders were blasted to clear\r\nthe rocky fields; and these, with the smaller loose stones, were\r\ngathered into vast stone walls. We still see these walls around fields\r\nand as the boundaries of kitchen gardens and farm flower gardens, and\r\ndelightful walls they are, resourceful of beauty to the inventive\r\ngardener. I know one lovely garden in old Narragansett, on a farm which\r\nis now the country-seat of folk of great wealth, where the old stone\r\nwalls are the pride of the place; and the carefully kept garden seems\r\nset in a beautiful frame of soft gray stones and flowering vines. These\r\nwalls would be more beautiful still if our climate would let us have the\r\nwall gardens of old England, but everything here becomes too dry in\r\nsummer for wall gardens to flourish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Guardian of the Garden.]\r\n\r\nRhode Island farmers for two centuries have cleared and sheltered the\r\nscanty soil of their state by blasting the ledges, and gathering the\r\ngreat stones of ledge and field into splendid stone walls. Their beauty\r\nis a gift to the farmer's descendants in reward for his hours of bitter\r\nand wearying toil. One of these fine stone walls, six feet in height,\r\nhas stood secure and unbroken through a century of upheavals of winter\r\nfrosts--which it was too broad and firmly built to heed. It stretches\r\nfrom the Post Road in old Narragansett, through field and meadow, and by\r\nthe side of the oak grove, to the very edge of the bay. To the waterside\r\none afternoon in June there strolled, a few years ago, a beautiful young\r\ngirl and a somewhat conscious but determined young man. They seated\r\nthemselves on the stone wall under the flickering shadow of a great\r\nLocust tree, then in full bloom. The air was sweet with the honeyed\r\nfragrance of the lovely pendent clusters of bloom, and bird and bee and\r\nbutterfly hovered around,--it was paradise. The beauty and fitness of\r\nthe scene so stimulated the young man's fancy to thoughts and words of\r\nlove that he soon burst forth to his companion in an impassioned avowal\r\nof his desire to make her his wife. He had often pictured to himself\r\nthat some time he would say to her these words, and he had seen also in\r\nhis hopes the looks of tender affection with which she would reply. What\r\nwas his amazement to behold that, instead of blushes and tender glances,\r\nhis words of love were met by an apparently frenzied stare of horror and\r\ndisgust, that seemed to pierce through him, as his beloved one sprung at\r\none bound from her seat by his side on the high stone wall, and ran away\r\nat full speed, screaming out, \"Oh, kill him! kill him!\"\r\n\r\nNow that was certainly more than disconcerting to the warmest of lovers,\r\nand with a half-formed dread that the suddenness of his proposal of love\r\nhad turned her brain, he ran after her, albeit somewhat coolly, and soon\r\nlearned the reason for her extraordinary behavior. Emulous of the\r\ntempting serpent of old, a great black snake, Mr. _Bascanion\r\nconstrictor_, had said complaisantly to himself: \"Now here are a fair\r\nyoung Adam and Eve who have entered uninvited my Garden of Eden, and the\r\nman fancies it is not good for him to be alone, but I will have a word\r\nto say about that. I will come to her with honied words.\" So he thrust\r\nhimself up between the stones of the wall, and advanced persuasively\r\nupon them, behind the man's back. But a Yankee Eve of the year 1890 A.D.\r\nis not that simple creature, the Eve of the year ---- B.C.; and even the\r\nFather of Evil would have to be great of guile to succeed in his wiles\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nA farm servant was promptly despatched to watch for the ill-mannered and\r\nintrusive snake who--as is the fashion of a snake--had grown to be as\r\nbig as a boa-constrictor after he vanished; and at the end of the week\r\nonce more the heel of man had bruised the serpent's head, and the third\r\nparty in this love episode lay dead in his six feet of ugliness, a\r\nsilent witness to the truth of the story.\r\n\r\nThroughout Narragansett, Locust trees have a fashion of fringing the\r\nstone walls with close young growth, and shading them with occasional\r\ntaller trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Terrace Wall at Van Cortlandt Manor.]\r\n\r\nThese form an ideal garden boundary. The stone walls also gather a\r\nbeautiful growth of Clematis, Brier, wild Peas, and Grapes; but they\r\nform a clinging-place for that devil's brood, Poison Ivy, which is so\r\npersistent in growth and so difficult to exterminate.\r\n\r\nThe old worm fence was distinctly American; it had a zigzag series of\r\nchestnut rails, with stakes of twisted cedar saplings which were\r\nsometimes \"chunked\" by moss-covered boulders just peeping from the\r\nearth. This worm fence secured to the nature lover and to wild life a\r\nstrip of land eight or ten feet wide, whereon plant, bird, beast,\r\nreptile, and insect flourished and reproduced. It has been, within a few\r\nyears, a gardening fashion to preserve these old \"Virginia\" fences on\r\ncountry places of considerable elegance. Planted with Clematis,\r\nHoneysuckle, Trumpet vine, Wistaria, and the free-growing new Japanese\r\nRoses, they are wonderfully effective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rail Fence Corner.]\r\n\r\nOn Long Island, east of Riverhead, where there are few stones to form\r\nstone walls, are curious and picturesque hedge-rows, which are a most\r\ninteresting and characteristic feature of the landscape, and they are\r\nbeautiful also, as I have seen them once or twice, at the end of an old\r\ngarden. These hedge-rows were thus formed: when a field was cleared, a\r\nrow of young saplings of varied growth, chiefly Oak, Elder, and Ash, was\r\nleft to form the hedge. These young trees were cut and bent over\r\nparallel to the ground, and sometimes interlaced together with dry\r\nbranches and vines. Each year these trees were lopped, and new sprouts\r\nand branches permitted to grow only in the line of the hedge. Soon a\r\ntangle of briers and wild vines overgrew and netted them all into a\r\nclose, impenetrable, luxuriant mass. They were, to use Wordsworth's\r\nphrase, \"scarcely hedge-rows, but lines of sportive woods run wild.\" In\r\nthis close green wall birds build their nests, and in their shelter\r\nburrow wild hares, and there open Violets and other firstlings of the\r\nspring. The twisted tree trunks in these old hedges are sometimes three\r\nor four feet in diameter one way, and but a foot or more the other; they\r\nwere a shiftless field-border, as they took up so much land, but they\r\nwere sheep-proof. The custom of making a dividing line by a row of bent\r\nand polled trees still remains, even where the close, tangled hedge-row\r\nhas disappeared with the flocks of sheep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Topiary Work at Levens Hall.]\r\n\r\nThese hedge-rows were an English fashion seen in Hertfordshire and\r\nSuffolk. On commons and reclaimed land they took the place of the\r\nquickset hedges seen around richer farm lands. The bending and\r\ninterlacing was called plashing; the polling, shrouding. English farmers\r\nand gardeners paid infinite attention to their hedges, both as a\r\nprotection to their fields and as a means of firewood.\r\n\r\nThere is something very pleasant in the thought that these English\r\ngentlemen who settled eastern Long Island, the Gardiners, Sylvesters,\r\nCoxes, and others, retained on their farm lands in the new world the\r\ncustoms of their English homes, pleasanter still to know that their\r\ndescendants for centuries kept up these homely farm fashions. The old\r\nhedge-rows on Long Island are an historical record, a landmark--long may\r\nthey linger. On some of the finest estates on the island they have been\r\ncarefully preserved, to form the lower boundary of a garden, where,\r\nlaid out with a shaded, grassy walk dividing it from the flower beds,\r\nthey form the loveliest of garden limits. Planted skilfully with great\r\nArt to look like great Nature, with edging of Elder and Wild Rose, with\r\nnative vines and an occasional congenial garden ally, they are truly\r\nunique.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oval Pergola at Arlington.]\r\n\r\nYew was used for the most famous English hedges; and as neither Yew nor\r\nHolly thrive here--though both will grow--I fancy that is why we have\r\never had in comparison so few hedges, and have really no very ancient\r\nones, though in old letters and account books we read of the planting of\r\nhedges on fine estates. George Washington tried it, so did Adams, and\r\nJefferson, and Quincy. Osage Orange, Barberry, and Privet were in\r\nnurserymen's lists, but it has not been till within twenty or thirty\r\nyears that Privet has become so popular. In Southern gardens, Cypress\r\nmade close, good garden hedges; and Cedar hedges fifty or sixty years\r\nold are seen. Lilac hedges were unsatisfactory, save in isolated cases,\r\nas the one at Indian Hill. The Japan Quinces, and other of the Japanese\r\nshrubs, were tried in hedges in the mid-century, with doubtful success\r\nas hedges, though they form lovely rows of flowering shrubs. Snowballs\r\nand Snowberries, Flowering Currant, Altheas, and Locust, all have been\r\nused for hedge-planting, so we certainly have tried faithfully enough to\r\nhave hedges in America. Locust hedges are most graceful, they cannot be\r\nclipped closely. I saw one lovely creation of Locust, set with an\r\noccasional Rose Acacia--and the Locust thus supported the brittle\r\nAcacia. If it were successful, it would be, when in bloom, a dream of\r\nbeauty. Hemlock hedges are ever fine, as are hemlock trees everywhere,\r\nbut will not bear too close clipping. Other evergreens, among them the\r\nvaried Spruces, have been set in hedges, but have not proved\r\nsatisfactory enough to be much used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: French Homestead with old Stone Terrace, Kingston, Rhode\r\nIsland.]\r\n\r\nBuckthorn was a century ago much used for hedges and arches. When Josiah\r\nQuincy, President of Harvard College, was in Congress in 1809, he\r\nobtained from an English gardener, in Georgetown, Buckthorn plants for\r\nhedges in his Massachusetts home, which hedges were an object of great\r\nbeauty for many years.\r\n\r\nThe traveller Kalm found Privet hedges in Pennsylvania in 1760. In\r\nScotland Privet is called Primprint. Primet and Primprivet were other\r\nold names. Box was called Primpe. These were all derivative of prim,\r\nmeaning precise. Our Privet hedges, new as they are, are of great beauty\r\nand satisfaction, and soon will rival the English Yew hedges.\r\n\r\nI have never yet seen the garden in which there was not some boundary or\r\nline which could be filled to advantage by a hedge. In garden great or\r\ngarden small, the hedge should ever have a place. Often a featureless\r\ngarden, blooming well, yet somehow unattractive, has been completely\r\ntransformed by the planting of hedges. They seem, too, to give such an\r\norderly aspect to the garden. In level countries hedges are specially\r\nvaluable. I cannot understand why some denounce clipped hedges and trees\r\nas against nature. A clipped hedge is just as natural as the cut grass\r\nof a lawn, and is closely akin to it. Others think hedges \"too set\"; to\r\nme their finality is their charm.\r\n\r\nHedges need to be well kept to be pleasing. Chaucer in his day in\r\npraising a \"hegge\" said that:--\r\n\r\n    \"Every branche and leaf must grow by mesure\r\n     Pleine as a bord, of an height by and by.\"\r\n\r\nIn England, hedge-clipping has ever been a gardening art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Italian Garden at Wellesley, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nIn the old English garden the topiarist was an important functionary.\r\nBesides his clipping shears he had to have what old-time cooks called\r\n_judgment_ or _faculty_. In English gardens many specimens of topiary\r\nwork still exist, maintained usually as relics of the past rather than\r\nas a modern notion of the beautiful. The old gardens at Levens Hall,\r\npage 404, contain some of the most remarkable examples.\r\n\r\nIn a few old gardens in America, especially in Southern towns, traces of\r\nthe topiary work of early years can be seen; these overgrown, uncertain\r\nshapes have a curious influence, and the sentiment awakened is\r\nbeautifully described by Gabriele d' Annunzio:--\r\n\r\n     \"We walked among evergreens, among ancient Box trees, Laurels,\r\n     Myrtles, whose wild old age had forgotten its early discipline. In\r\n     a few places here and there was some trace of the symmetrical\r\n     shapes carved once upon a time by the gardener's shears, and with a\r\n     melancholy not unlike his who searches on old tombstones for the\r\n     effigies of the forgotten dead, I noted carefully among the silent\r\n     plants those traces of humanity not altogether obliterated.\"\r\n\r\nThe height of topiary art in America is reached in the lovely garden,\r\noften called the Italian garden, of Hollis H. Hunnewell, Esq., at\r\nWellesley, Massachusetts. Vernon Lee tells in her charming essay on\r\n\"Italian Gardens\" of the beauty of gardens without flowers, and this\r\ngarden of Mr. Hunnewell is an admirable example. Though the effect of\r\nthe black and white of the pictured representations shown on these pages\r\nis perhaps somewhat sombre, there is nothing sad or sombre in the garden\r\nitself. The clear gleam of marble pavilions and balustrades, the formal\r\nrows of flower jars with their hundreds of Century plants, and the\r\nlovely light on the lovely lake, serve as a delightful contrast to the\r\nclear, clean lusty green of the clipped trees. This garden is a\r\nbeautiful example of the art of the topiarist, not in its grotesque\r\nforms, but in the shapes liked by Lord Bacon, pyramids, columns, and\r\n\"hedges in welts,\" carefully studied to be both stately and graceful. I\r\nfirst saw this garden thirty years ago; it was interesting then in its\r\nwell thought-out plan, and in the perfection of every inch of its slow\r\ngrowth; but how much more beautiful now, when the garden's promise is\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steps in Italian Garden at Wellesley, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nThe editor of _Country Life_ says that the most notable attempt at\r\nmodern topiary work in England is at Ascott, the seat of Mr. Leopold de\r\nRothschild, but the examples there have not attained a growth at all\r\napproaching those at Wellesley. Mr. Hunnewell writes thus of his\r\ngarden:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was after a visit to Elvaston nearly fifty years ago that I\r\n     conceived the idea of making a collection of trees for topiary work\r\n     in imitation of what I had witnessed at that celebrated estate. As\r\n     suitable trees for that purpose could not be obtained at the\r\n     nurseries in this country, and as the English Yew is not reliable\r\n     in our New England climate, I was obliged to make the best\r\n     selection possible from such trees as had proved hardy here--the\r\n     Pines, Spruces, Hemlocks, Junipers, Arbor-vitae, Cedars, and\r\n     Japanese Retinosporas. The trees were all very small, and for the\r\n     first twenty years their growth was shortened twice annually,\r\n     causing them to take a close and compact habit, comparing favorably\r\n     in that respect with the Yew. Many of them are now more than forty\r\n     feet in height and sixty feet in circumference, the Hemlocks\r\n     especially proving highly successful.\"\r\n\r\nThis beautiful example of art in nature is ever open to visitors, and\r\nthe number of such visitors is very large. It is, however, but one of\r\nthe many beauties of the great estate, with its fine garden of Roses,\r\nits pavilion of splendid Rhododendrons and Azaleas, its uncommon and\r\nvery successful rock garden, and its magnificent plantation of rare\r\ntrees. There are also many rows of fine hedges and arches in various\r\nportions of the grounds, hedges of clipped Cedar and Hemlock, many of\r\nthem twenty feet high, which compare well in condition, symmetry, and\r\nextent with the finest English hedges on the finest English estates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Topiary Work in California.]\r\n\r\nThrough the great number of formal gardens laid out within a few years\r\nin America, the topiary art has had a certain revival. In California,\r\nwith the lavish foliage, it may be seen in considerable perfection,\r\nthough of scant beauty, as here shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Serpentine Brick Wall at University of Virginia,\r\nCharlottesville.]\r\n\r\nHappy is the garden surrounded by a brick wall or with terrace wall of\r\nbrick. How well every color looks by the side of old brick; even\r\nscarlet, bright pink, and rose-pink flowers, which seem impossible, do\r\nvery well when held to the wall by clear green leaves. Flowering vines\r\nare perfect when trained on old soft-red brick enclosing walls;\r\nwhite-flowered vines are specially lovely thereon, Clematis, white\r\nRoses, and the rarely beautiful white Wistaria. How lovely is my\r\nVirgin's-bower when growing on brick; how Hollyhocks stand up beside it.\r\nBrick posts, too, are good in a fence, and, better still, in a pergola.\r\nA portion of the fine terrace wall at Van Cortlandt Manor is shown\r\nfacing page 286. This wall was put in about fifty years ago; ere that\r\nthere had been a grass bank, which is ever a trial in a garden; for it\r\nis hard to mow the grass on such a bank, and it never looks neat; it\r\nshould be planted with some vine.\r\n\r\nA very curious garden wall is the serpentine brick wall still standing\r\nat the University of Virginia, at Charlottesville. It is about seven\r\nfeet high, and closes in the garden and green of the row of houses\r\noccupied by members of the faculty; originally it may have extended\r\naround the entire college grounds. I present a view from the street in\r\norder to show its contour distinctly; within the garden its outlines are\r\nobscured by vines and flowers. The first thought in the mind of the\r\nobserver is that its reason for curving is that it could be built much\r\nmore lightly, and hence more cheaply, than a straight wall; then it\r\nseems a possible idealization in brick of the old Virginia rail fence.\r\nBut I do not look to domestic patterns and influences for its\r\nproduction; it is to me a good example of the old-time domination of\r\nFrench ideas which was so marked and so disquieting in America. In\r\nFrance, after the peace of 1762, the Marquis de Geradin was\r\nrevolutionizing gardening. His own garden at Ermenonville and his\r\ndescription of it exercised important influence in England and America,\r\nas in France. Jefferson was the planner and architect of the University\r\nof Virginia; and it is stated that he built this serpentine wall.\r\nWhether he did or not, it is another example of French influences in\r\narchitecture in the United States. This French school, above everything\r\nelse, replaced straight lines with carefully curving and winding lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA MOONLIGHT GARDEN\r\n\r\n        \"How sweetly smells the Honeysuckle\r\n    In the hush'd night, as if the world were one\r\n    Of utter peace and love and gentleness.\"\r\n\r\n    --WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR\r\n\r\n\r\nGardens fanciful of name, a Saint's Garden, a Friendship Garden, have\r\nbeen planted and cherished. I plant a garden like none other; not an\r\neveryday garden, nor indeed a garden of any day, but a garden for \"brave\r\nmoonshine,\" a garden of twilight opening and midnight bloom, a garden of\r\nnocturnal blossoms, a garden of white blossoms, and the sweetest garden\r\nin the world. It is a garden of my dreams, but I know where it lies, and\r\nit now is smiling back at this very harvest moon.\r\n\r\nThe old house of Hon. Ben. Perley Poore--Indian Hill--at Newburyport,\r\nMassachusetts, has been for many years one of the loveliest of New\r\nEngland's homes. During his lifetime it had extraordinary charms, for on\r\nthe noble hillside, where grew scattered in sunny fields and pastures\r\nevery variety of native tree that would winter New England's snow and\r\nice, there were vast herds of snow-white cows, and flocks of white\r\nsheep, and the splendid oxen were white. White pigeons circled in the\r\nair around ample dove-cotes, and the farmyard poultry were all white; an\r\nenthusiastic chronicler recounts also white peacocks on the wall, but\r\nthese are also denied.\r\n\r\nOn every side were old terraced walls covered with Roses and flowering\r\nvines, banked with shrubs, and standing in beds of old-time flowers\r\nrunning over with bloom; but behind the house, stretching up the lovely\r\nhillside, was The Garden, and when we entered it, lo! it was a White\r\nGarden with edgings of pure and seemly white Candytuft from the forcing\r\nbeds, and flowers of Spring Snowflake and Star of Bethlehem and\r\nJonquils; and there were white-flowered shrubs of spring, the earliest\r\nSpiraeas and Deutzias; the doubled-flowered Cherries and Almonds and old\r\nfavorites, such as Peter's Wreath, all white and wonderfully expressive\r\nof a simplicity, a purity, a closeness to nature.\r\n\r\nI saw this lovely farmstead and radiant White Garden first in glowing\r\nsunlight, but far rarer must have been its charm in moonlight; though\r\nthe white beasts (as English hinds call cattle) were sleeping in careful\r\nshelter; and the white dog, assured of their safety, was silent; and the\r\nwhite fowl were in coop and cote; and\r\n\r\n    \"Only the white sheep were sometimes seen\r\n     To cross the strips of moon-blanch'd green.\"\r\n\r\nBut the White Garden, ah! then the garden truly lived; it was like\r\nlightest snow wreaths bathed in silvery moonshine, with every radiant\r\nflower adoring the moon with wide-open eyes, and pouring forth incense\r\nat her altar. And it was peopled with shadowy forms shaped of pearly\r\nmists and dews; and white night moths bore messages for them from flower\r\nto flower--this garden then was the garden of my dreams.\r\n\r\nThoreau complained to himself that he had not put duskiness enough into\r\nhis words in his description of his evening walks. He longed to have the\r\npeculiar and classic severity of his sentences, the color of his style,\r\ntell his readers that his scene was laid at night without saying so in\r\nexact words. I, too, have not written as I wished, by moonlight; I can\r\ntell of moonlight in the garden, but I desire more; I want you to see\r\nand feel this moonlight garden, as did Emily Dickinson her garden by\r\nmoonlight:--\r\n\r\n    \"And still within the summer's night\r\n     A something so transporting bright\r\n     I clap my hands to see.\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps I can no more gather it into words than I can bottle up the\r\nmoonlight itself.\r\n\r\nThis lovely garden, varied in shape, and extending in many and diverse\r\ndirections and corners, bears as its crown a magnificent double flower\r\nborder over seven hundred feet long; with a broad straight path trimly\r\nedged with Box adown through its centre, and with a flower border twelve\r\nfeet wide on either side. This was laid out and planted in 1833 by the\r\nparents of Major Poore, after extended travel in England, and doubtless\r\nunder the influences of the beautiful English flower gardens they had\r\nseen. Its length was originally broken halfway up the hill and crowned\r\nat the top of the hill by some formal parterres of careful design, but\r\nthese now are removed. There are graceful arches across the path, one of\r\nHoneysuckle on the crown of the hill, from which you look out perhaps\r\ninto Paradise--for Indian Hill in June is a very close neighbor to\r\nParadise; it is difficult to define the boundaries between the two, and\r\nto me it would be hard to choose between them.\r\n\r\nStanding in this arch on this fair hill, you can look down the long\r\nflower borders of color and perfume to the old house, lying in the heart\r\nof the trees and vines and flowers. To your left is the hill-sweep,\r\nbearing the splendid grove, an arboretum of great native trees, planted\r\nby Major Poore, and for which he received the prize awarded by his\r\nnative state to the finest plantation of trees within its bounds. Turn\r\nfrom the house and garden, and look through this frame of vines formed\r\nby the arch upon this scene,--the loveliest to me of any on earth,--a\r\nfair New England summer landscape. Fields of rich corn and grain, broken\r\nat times with the gray granite boulders which show what centuries of\r\ngrand and sturdy toil were given to make these fertile fields; ample\r\norchards full of promise of fruit; placid lakes and mill-dams and narrow\r\nsilvery rivers, with low-lying red brick mills embowered in trees; dark\r\nforests of sombre Pine and Cedar and Oak; narrow lanes and broad\r\nhighways shaded with the livelier green of Elm and Maple and Birch;\r\ngray farm-houses with vast barns; little towns of thrifty white houses\r\nclustered around slender church-spires which, set thickly over this\r\nsunny land, point everywhere to heaven, and tell, as if speaking, the\r\nstory of New England's past, of her foundation on love of God, just as\r\nthe fields and orchards and highways speak of thrift and honesty and\r\nhard labor; and the houses, such as this of Indian Hill, of kindly\r\nneighborliness and substantial comfort; and as this old garden speaks of\r\na love of the beautiful, a refinement, an aesthetic and tender side of\r\nNew England character which _we_ know, but into which--as Mr. Underwood\r\nsays in _Quabbin_, that fine study of New England life--\"strangers and\r\nKiplings cannot enter.\"\r\n\r\nSeven hundred feet of double flower border, fourteen hundred feet of\r\nflower bed, twelve feet wide! \"It do swallow no end of plants,\" says the\r\ngardener.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chestnut Path in Garden at Indian Hill.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the banishing dictum of many artists in regard to white\r\nflowers in a garden, the presence of ample variety of white flowers is\r\nto me the greatest factor in producing harmony and beauty both by night\r\nand day. White seems to be as important a foil in some cases as green.\r\nIt may sometimes be given to the garden in other ways than through\r\nflower blossoms, by white marble statues, vases, pedestals, seats.\r\n\r\nWe all like the approval of our own thoughts by men of genius; with my\r\nlove of white flowers I had infinite gratification in these words of\r\nWalter Savage Landor's, written from Florence in regard to a friend's\r\ngarden:--\r\n\r\n     \"I like white flowers better than any others; they resemble fair\r\n     women. Lily, Tuberose, Orange, and the truly English Syringa are my\r\n     heart's delight. I do not mean to say that they supplant the Rose\r\n     and Violet in my affections, for these are our first loves, before\r\n     we grew _too fond of considering_; and too fond of displaying our\r\n     acquaintance with others of sounding titles.\"\r\n\r\nIn Japan, where flowers have rank, white flowers are the aristocrats. I\r\ndeem them the aristocrats in the gardens of the Occident also.\r\n\r\nHaving been informed of Tennyson's dislike of white flowers, I have\r\namused myself by trying to discover in his poems evidence of such\r\naversion. I think one possibly might note an indifference to white\r\nblossoms; but strong color sense, his love of ample and rich color,\r\nwould naturally make him name white infrequently. A pretty line in\r\n_Walking to the Mail_ tells of a girl with \"a skin as clean and white as\r\nPrivet when it flowers\"; and there were White Lilies and Roses and\r\nmilk-white Acacias in Maud's garden.\r\n\r\nIn _The Last Tournament_ the street-ways are depicted as hung with white\r\nsamite, and \"children sat in white,\" and the dames and damsels were all\r\n\"white-robed in honor of the stainless child.\" A \"swarthy one\" cried out\r\nat last:--\r\n\r\n    \"The snowdrop only, flowering thro' the year,\r\n     Would make the world as blank as wintertide.\r\n     Come!--let us gladden their sad eyes\r\n     With all the kindlier colors of the field.\r\n     So dame and damsel glitter'd at the feast\r\n     Variously gay....\r\n     So dame and damsel cast the simple white,\r\n     And glowing in all colors, the live grass,\r\n     Rose-campion, King-cup, Bluebell, Poppy, glanced\r\n     About the revels.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Foxgloves in Lower Garden at Indian Hill.]\r\n\r\nIn the garden borders is a commonplace little plant, gray of foliage,\r\nwith small, drooping, closed flowers of an indifferently dull tint, you\r\nwould almost wonder at its presence among its gay garden fellows. Let us\r\nglance at it in the twilight, for it seems like the twilight, a soft,\r\nshaded gray; but the flowers have already lifted their heads and opened\r\ntheir petals, and they now seem like the twilight clouds of palest pink\r\nand lilac. It is the Night-scented Stock, and lavishly through the still\r\nnight it pours forth its ineffable fragrance. A single plant, thirty\r\nfeet from an open window, will waft its perfume into the room. This\r\nwhite Stock was a favorite flower of Marie Antoinette, under its French\r\nname the Julienne. \"Night Violets,\" is its appropriate German name.\r\nHesperis! the name shows its habit. Dame's Rocket is our title for this\r\ncheerful old favorite of May, which shines in such snowy beauty at\r\nnight, and throws forth such a compelling fragrance. It is rarely found\r\nin our gardens, but I have seen it growing wild by the roadside in\r\nsecluded spots; not in ample sheets of growth like Bouncing Bet, which\r\nwe at first glance thought it was; it is a shyer stray, blossoming\r\nearlier than comely Betsey.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned single, or slightly double, country Pink, known as\r\nSnow Pink or Star Pink, was often used as an edging for small borders,\r\nand its bluish green, almost gray, foliage was quaint in effect and\r\nbeautiful in the moonlight. When seen at night, the reason for the\r\nfolk-name is evident. Last summer, on a heavily clouded night in June,\r\nin a cottage garden at West Hampton, borders of this Snow Pink shone out\r\nof the darkness with a phosphorescent light, like hoar-frost, on every\r\ngrassy leaf; while the hundreds of pale pink blossoms seemed softly\r\nshining stars. It was a curious effect, almost wintry, even in\r\nmidsummer. The scent was wafted down the garden path, and along the\r\ncountry road, like a concentrated essence, rather than a fleeting breath\r\nof flowers. One of these cottage borders is shown on page 292, and I\r\nhave named it from these lines from _The Garden that I Love_:--\r\n\r\n    \"A running ribbon of perfumed snow\r\n     Which the sun is melting rapidly.\"\r\n\r\nAt sundown the beautiful white Day Lily opens and gives forth all night\r\nan overwhelming sweetness; I have never seen night moths visiting it,\r\nthough I know they must, since a few seed capsules always form. In the\r\nborder stand--\r\n\r\n                \"Clumps of sunny Phlox\r\n    That shine at dusk, and grow more deeply sweet.\"\r\n\r\nThese, with white Petunias, are almost unbearably cloying in their heavy\r\nodor. It is a curious fact that some of these night-scented flowers are\r\npositively offensive in the daytime; try your _Nicotiana affinis_ next\r\nmidday--it outpours honeyed sweetness at night, but you will be glad it\r\nwithholds its perfume by day. The plants of Nicotiana were first\r\nintroduced to England for their beauty, sweet scent, and medicinal\r\nqualities, not to furnish smoke. Parkinson in 1629 writes of Tobacco,\r\n\"With us it is cherished for medicinal qualities as for the beauty of\r\nits flowers,\" and Gerarde, in 1633, after telling of the beauty, etc.,\r\nsays that the dried leaves are \"taken in a pipe, set on fire, the smoke\r\nsuckt into the stomach, and thrust forth at the noshtrils.\"\r\n\r\nSnake-root, sometimes called Black Cohosh (_Cimicifuga racemosa_), is\r\none of the most stately wild flowers, and a noble addition to the\r\ngarden. A picture of a single plant gives little impression of its\r\ndignity of habit, its wonderfully decorative growth; but the succession\r\nof pure white spires, standing up several feet high at the edge of a\r\nswampy field, or in a garden, partake of that compelling charm which\r\ncomes from tall trees of slender growth, from repetition and\r\nassociation, such as pine trees, rows of bayonets, the gathered masts of\r\na harbor, from stalks of corn in a field, from rows of Foxglove--from\r\nall \"serried ranks.\" I must not conceal the fact of its horrible odor,\r\nwhich might exile it from a small garden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dame's Rocket.]\r\n\r\nAmong my beloved white flowers, a favorite among those who are all\r\nfavorites, is the white Columbine. Some are double, but the common\r\nsingle white Columbines picture far better the derivation of their\r\nname; they are like white doves, they seem almost an emblematic flower.\r\nWilliam Morris says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Be very shy of double flowers; choose the old Columbine where the\r\n     clustering doves are unmistakable and distinct, not the double one,\r\n     where they run into mere tatters. Don't be swindled out of that\r\n     wonder of beauty, a single Snowdrop; there is no gain and plenty of\r\n     loss in the double one.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some extremists, such as Dr. Forbes Watson, who condemn all\r\ndouble flowers. One thing in the favor of double blooms is that their\r\nperfume is increased with their petals. Double Violets, Roses, and Pinks\r\nseem as natural now as single flowers of their kinds. I confess a\r\ndistinct aversion to the thought of a double Lilac. I have never seen\r\none, though the Ranoncule, said to be very fine, costs but forty cents a\r\nplant, and hence must be much grown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Snake-root.]\r\n\r\nThere is a curious influence of flower-color which I can only explain by\r\ngiving an example. We think of Iris, Gladiolus, Lupine, and even\r\nFoxglove and Poppy as flowers of a warm and vivid color; so where we see\r\nthem a pure white, they have a distinct and compelling effect on us,\r\npleasing, but a little eerie; not a surprise, for we have always known\r\nthe white varieties, yet not exactly what we are wonted to. This has\r\nnothing of the grotesque, as is produced by the albino element in the\r\nanimal world; it is simply a trifle mysterious. White Pansies and White\r\nViolets possess this quality to a marked degree. I always look and look\r\nagain at growing White Violets. A friend says: \"Do you think they will\r\nspeak to you?\" for I turn to them with such an expectancy of something.\r\n\r\nThe \"everlasting\" white Pea is a most satisfactory plant by day or\r\nnight. Hedges covered with it are a pure delight. Do not fear to plant\r\nit with liberal hand. Be very liberal, too, in your garden of white\r\nFoxgloves. Even if the garden be small, there is room for many graceful\r\nspires of the lovely bells to shine out everywhere, piercing up through\r\ngreen foliage and colored blooms of other plants. They are not only\r\nbeautiful, but they are flowers of sentiment and association, endeared\r\nto childhood, visited of bees, among the best beloved of old-time\r\nfavorites. They consort well with nearly every other flower, and\r\ncertainly with every other color, and they seem to clarify many a\r\ncrudely or dingily tinted flower; they are as admirable foils as they\r\nare principals in the garden scheme. In England, where they readily grow\r\nwild, they are often planted at the edge of a wood, or to form vistas in\r\na copse. I doubt whether they would thrive here thus planted, but they\r\nare admirable when set in occasional groups to show in pure whiteness\r\nagainst a hedge. I say in occasional groups, for the Foxglove should\r\nnever be planted in exact rows. The White Iris, the Iris of the\r\nFlorentine Orris-root, is one of the noblest plants of the whole world;\r\nits pure petals are truly hyaline like snow-ice, like translucent white\r\nglass; and the indescribably beautiful drooping lines of the flowers are\r\nsuch a contrast with the defiant erectness of the fresh green leaves.\r\nSmall wonder that it was a sacred flower of the Greeks. It was called\r\nby the French _la flambe blanche_, a beautiful poetic title--the White\r\nTorch of the Garden.\r\n\r\nA flower of mystery, of wonderment to children, was the Evening\r\nPrimrose; I knew the garden variety only with intimacy. Possibly the\r\nwild flower had similar charms and was equally weird in the gloaming,\r\nbut it grew by country roadsides, and I was never outside our garden\r\nlimits after nightfall, so I know not its evening habits. We had in our\r\ngarden a variety known as the California Evening Primrose--a giant\r\nflower as tall as our heads. My mother saw its pale yellow stars shining\r\nin the early evening in a cottage garden on Cape Ann, and was there\r\ngiven, out of the darkness, by a fellow flower lover, the seeds which\r\nhave afforded to us every year since so much sentiment and pleasure. The\r\nmost exquisite description of the Evening Primrose is given by Margaret\r\nDeland in her _Old Garden_:--\r\n\r\n    \"There the primrose stands, that as the night\r\n     Begins to gather, and the dews to fall,\r\n     Flings wide to circling moths her twisted buds,\r\n     That shine like yellow moons with pale cold glow,\r\n     And all the air her heavy fragrance floods,\r\n     And gives largess to any winds that blow.\r\n     Here in warm darkness of a night in June, ... children came\r\n     To watch the primrose blow. Silently they stood\r\n     Hand clasped in hand, in breathless hush around,\r\n     And saw her slyly doff her soft green hood\r\n     And blossom--with a silken burst of sound.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Title-page of Parkinson's _Paradisi in Solis_,\r\netc.]\r\n\r\nThe wild Primrose opens slowly, hesitatingly, it trembles open, but the\r\ngarden Primrose flares open.\r\n\r\nThe Evening Primrose is usually classed with sweet-scented flowers, but\r\nthat exact observer, E. V. B., tells of its \"repulsive smell. At night\r\nif the stem be shaken, or if the flower-cup trembles at the touch of a\r\nmoth as it alights, out pours the dreadful odor.\" I do not know that any\r\nother garden flower opens with a distinct sound. Owen Meredith's poem,\r\n_The Aloe_, tells that the Aloe opened with such a loud explosive report\r\nthat the rooks shrieked and folks ran out of the house to learn whence\r\ncame the sound.\r\n\r\nThe tall columns of the Yucca or Adam's Needle stood like shafts of\r\nmarble against the hedge trees of the Indian Hill garden. Their\r\nbeautiful blooms are a miniature of those of the great Century Plant. In\r\nthe daytime the Yucca's blossoms hang in scentless, greenish white\r\nbells, but at night these bells lift up their heads and expand with\r\ngreat stars of light and odor--a glorious plant. Around their spire of\r\nluminous bells circle pale night moths, lured by the rich fragrance.\r\nEven by moonlight we can see the little white detached fibres at the\r\nedge of the leaves, which we are told the Mexican women used as thread\r\nto sew with. And we children used to pull off the strong fibres and put\r\nthem in a needle and sew with them too.\r\n\r\nWhen I see those Yuccas in bloom I fully believe that they are the\r\ngrandest flowers of our gardens; but happily, I have a short garden\r\nmemory, so I mourn not the Yucca when I see the _Anemone japonica_ or\r\nany other noble white garden child.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yucca, like White Marble against the Evergreens.]\r\n\r\nHere at the end of the garden walk is an arbor dark with the shadow of\r\ngreat leaves, such as Gerarde calls \"leaves round and big like to a\r\nbuckler.\" But out of that shadowed background of leaf on leaf shine\r\nhundreds of pure, pale stars of sweetness and light,--a true flower of\r\nthe night in fragrance, beauty, and name,--the Moon-vine. It is a flower\r\nof sentiment, full of suggestion.\r\n\r\nDid you ever see a ghost in a garden? I do so wish I could. If I had the\r\nplacing of ghosts, I would not make them mope round in stuffy old\r\nbedrooms and garrets; but would place one here in this arbor in my\r\nMoonlight Garden. But if I did, I have no doubt she would take up a hoe\r\nor a watering-pot, and proceed to do some very unghostlike\r\ndeed--perhaps, grub up weeds. Longfellow had a ghost in his garden (page\r\n142). He must have mourned when he found it was only a clothes-line and\r\na long night-gown.\r\n\r\nIt was the favorite tale of a Swedish old lady who lived to be\r\nninety-six years old, of a discovery of her youth, in the year 1762, of\r\nstrange flashes of light which sparkled out of the flowers of the\r\nNasturtium one sultry night. I suppose the average young woman of the\r\naverage education of the day and her country might not have heeded or\r\ntold of this, but she was the daughter of Linnaeus, the great botanist,\r\nand had not the everyday education.\r\n\r\nThen great Goethe saw and wrote of similar flashes of light around\r\nOriental Poppies; and soon other folk saw them also--naturalists and\r\neveryday folk. Usually yellow flowers were found to display this\r\nlight--Marigolds, orange Lilies, and Sunflowers. Then the daughter of\r\nLinnaeus reported another curious discovery; she certainly turned her\r\nnocturnal rambles in her garden to good account. She averred she had\r\nset fire to a certain gas which formed and hung around the Fraxinella,\r\nand that the ignition did not injure the plant. This assertion was met\r\nwith open scoffing and disbelief, which has never wholly ceased; yet the\r\npopular name of Gas Plant indicates a widespread confidence in this\r\nquality of the Fraxinella and it is easily proved true.\r\n\r\nAnother New England name for the Fraxinella, given me from the owner of\r\nthe herb-garden at Elmhurst, is \"Spitfire Plant,\" because the seed-pods\r\nsizzle so when a lighted match is applied to them.\r\n\r\nThe Fraxinella is a sturdy, hardy flower. There are some aged plants in\r\nold New England gardens; I know one which has outlived the man who\r\nplanted it, his son, grandson, and great-grandson. The Fraxinella bears\r\na tall stem with Larkspur-like flowers of white or a curious dark pink,\r\nand shining Ash-like leaves, whence its name, the little Ash. It is one\r\nof the finest plants of the old-fashioned garden; fine in bloom, fine in\r\nhabit of growth, and it even has decorative seed vessels. It is as ready\r\nof scent as anything in the garden; if you but brush against leaf, stem,\r\nflower, or seed, as you walk down the garden path, it gives forth a\r\npenetrating perfume, that you think at first is like Lemon, then like\r\nAnise, then like Lavender; until you finally decide it is like nothing\r\nsave Fraxinella. As with the blossoms of the Calycanthus shrub, you can\r\nnever mistake the perfume, when once you know it, for anything else. It\r\nis a scent of distinction. Through this individuality it is, therefore,\r\nfull of associations, and correspondingly beloved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fraxinella.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nFLOWERS OF MYSTERY\r\n\r\n    \"Let thy upsoaring vision range at large\r\n     This garden through: for so by ray divine\r\n     Kindled, thy ken a magic flight shall mount.\"\r\n\r\n    --CARY'S Translation of Dante.\r\n\r\n\r\nBogies and fairies, a sense of eeriness, came to every garden-bred child\r\nof any imagination in connection with certain flowers. These flowers\r\nseemed to be regarded thus through no special rule or reason. With some\r\nthere may have been slight associations with fairy lore, or medicinal\r\nusage, or a hint of meretriciousness. Sometimes the child hardly\r\nformulated his thought of the flower, yet the dread or dislike or\r\ncuriosity existed. My own notions were absolutely baseless, and usually\r\nabsurd. I doubt if we communicated these fancies to each other save in a\r\nfew cases, as of the Monk's-hood, when we had been warned that the\r\nflower was poisonous.\r\n\r\nI have read with much interest Dr. Forbes Watson's account of plants\r\nthat filled his childish mind with mysterious awe and wonder; among them\r\nwere the Spurge, Henbane, Rue, Dogtooth Violet, Nigella, and pink Marsh\r\nMallow. The latter has ever been to me one of the most cheerful of\r\nblossoms. I did not know it in my earliest childhood, and never saw it\r\nin gardens till recent years. It is too close a cousin of the Hollyhock\r\never to seem to me aught but a happy flower. Henbane and Rue I did not\r\nknow, but I share his feeling toward the others, though I could not\r\ncarry it to the extent of fancying these the plants which a young man\r\ngathered, distilled, and gave to his betrothed as a poison.\r\n\r\nThere has ever been much uncanny suggestion in the Cypress Spurge. I\r\nnever should have picked it had I found it in trim gardens; but I saw it\r\nonly in forlorn and neglected spots. Perhaps its sombre tinge may come\r\nnow from association, since it is often seen in country graveyards; and\r\nI heard a country woman once call it \"Graveyard Ground Pine.\" But this\r\nassociation was not what influenced my childhood, for I never went then\r\nto graveyards.\r\n\r\nIn driving along our New England roads I am ever reminded of Parkinson's\r\ndictum that \"Spurge once planted will hardly be got rid out again.\" For\r\nby every decaying old house, in every deserted garden, and by the\r\nroadside where houses may have been, grows and spreads this Cypress\r\nSpurge. I know a large orchard in Narragansett from which grass has\r\nwholly vanished; it has been crowded out by the ugly little plant, which\r\nhas even invaded the adjoining woods.\r\n\r\nI wonder why every one in colonial days planted it, for it is said to\r\nbe poisonous in its contact to some folks, and virulently poisonous to\r\neat--though I am sure no one ever wanted to eat it. The colonists even\r\nbrought it over from England, when we had here such lovely native\r\nplants. It seldom flowers. Old New England names for it are\r\nLove-in-a-huddle and Seven Sisters; not over significant, but of\r\ninterest, as folk-names always are.\r\n\r\nI join with Dr. Forbes Watson in finding the Nigella uncanny. It has a\r\nhalf-spidery look, that seems ungracious in a flower. Its names are\r\ncurious: Love-in-a-mist, Love-in-a-puzzle, Love-in-a-tangle,\r\nPuzzle-love, Devil-in-a-bush, Katherine-flowers--another of the many\r\nallusions to St. Katherine and her wheel; and the persistent styles do\r\nresemble the spokes of a wheel. A name given it in a cottage garden in\r\nWayland was Blue Spider-flower, which seems more suited than that of\r\nSpiderwort for the Tradescantia. Spiderwort, like all \"three-cornered\"\r\nflowers, is a flower of mystery; and so little cared for to-day that it\r\nis almost extinct in our gardens, save where it persists in\r\nout-of-the-way spots. A splendid clump of it is here shown, which grows\r\nstill in the Worcester garden I so loved in my childhood. In this plant\r\nthe old imagined tracings of spider's legs in the leaves can scarce be\r\nseen. With the fanciful notion of \"like curing like\" ever found in old\r\nmedical recipes, Gerarde says, vaguely, the leaves are good for \"the\r\nBite of that Great Spider,\" a creature also of mystery.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if the clear blue flowers kept open throughout the day, the\r\nSpiderwort would be more tolerated, for this picture certainly has a\r\nJapanesque appearance, and what we must acknowledge was far more\r\ncharacteristic of old-time flowers than of many new ones, a wonderful\r\nindividuality; there was no sameness of outline. I could draw the\r\noutline of a dozen blossoms of our modern gardens, and you could not in\r\na careless glance distinguish one from the other: Cosmos, _Anemone\r\njaponica_, single Dahlias, and Sunflowers, Gaillardia, Gazanias, all\r\nsuch simple Rose forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Love-in-a-mist.]\r\n\r\nThere was a quaint and mysterious annual in ancient gardens, called\r\nShell flower, or Molucca Balm, which is not found now even on seedsmen's\r\nspecial lists of old-fashioned plants. The flower was white,\r\npink-tipped, and set in a cup-shaped calyx an inch long, which was\r\nbigger than the flower itself. The plant stood two or three feet high,\r\nand the sweet-scented flowers were in whorls of five or six on a stem.\r\nIt is a good example of my assertion that the old flowers had queerer\r\nshapes than modern ones, and were made of queer materials; the calyx of\r\nthis Shell flower is of such singular quality and fibre.\r\n\r\nThe Dog-tooth Violet always had to me a sickly look, but its leaves give\r\nit its special offensiveness; all spotted leaves, or flower petals which\r\nshowed the slightest resemblance to the markings of a snake or lizard,\r\nalways filled me with dislike. Among them I included Lungwort\r\n(Pulmonaria), a flower which seems suddenly to have disappeared from\r\nmany gardens, even old-fashioned ones, just as it has disappeared from\r\nmedicine. Not a gardener could be found in our public parks in New York\r\nwho had ever seen it, or knew it, though there is in Prospect Park a\r\nwell-filled and noteworthy \"Old-fashioned Garden.\" Let me add, in\r\npassing, that nothing in the entire park system--greenhouses, water\r\ngardens, Italian gardens--affords such delight to the public as this\r\nold-fashioned garden.\r\n\r\nThe changing blue and pink flowers of the Lungwort, somewhat\r\ncharacteristic of its family, are curious also. This plant was also\r\nknown by the singular name of Joseph-and-Mary; the pink flowers being\r\nthe emblem of Joseph; the blue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Lady's-tears\r\nwas an allied name, from a legend that the Virgin Mary's tears fell on\r\nthe leaves, causing the white spots to grow in them, and that one of\r\nher blue eyes became red from excessive weeping. It was held to be\r\nunlucky even to destroy the plant. Soldier-and-his-wife also had\r\nreference to the red and blue tints of the flower.\r\n\r\nA cousin of the Lungwort, our native _Mertensia virginica_, has in the\r\nyoung plant an equally singular leafage; every ordinary process of leaf\r\nprogress is reversed: the young shoots are not a tender green, but are\r\nalmost black, and change gradually in leaf, stem, and flower calyx to an\r\nodd light green in which the dark color lingers in veins and spots until\r\nthe plant is in its full flower of tender blue, lilac, and pink. \"Blue\r\nand pink ladies\" we used to call the blossoms when we hung them on pins\r\nfor a fairy dance.\r\n\r\nThe Alstroemeria is another spotted flower of the old borders, curious\r\nin its funnel-shaped blooms, edged and lined with tiny brown and green\r\nspots. It is more grotesque than beautiful, but was beloved in a day\r\nthat deemed the Tiger Lily the most beautiful of all lilies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spiderwort.]\r\n\r\nThe aversion I feel for spotted leaves does not extend to striped ones,\r\nthough I care little for variegated or striped foliage in a garden. I\r\nlike the striped white and green leaves of one variety of our garden\r\nIris, and of our common Sweet Flag (Calamus), which are decorative to a\r\nmost satisfactory degree. The firm ribbon leaves of the striped Sweet\r\nFlag never turn brown in the driest summer, and grow very tall; a tub of\r\nit kept well watered is a thing of surprising beauty, and the plants are\r\nvery handsome in the rock garden. I wonder what the bees seek in the\r\nleaves! they throng its green and white blades in May, finding\r\nsomething, I am sure, besides the delightful scent; though I do not note\r\nthat they pierce the veins of the plant for the sap, as I have known\r\nthem to do along the large veins of certain palm leaves. I have seen\r\nbees often act as though they were sniffing a flower with appreciation,\r\nnot gathering honey. The only endeared striped leaf was that of the\r\nStriped Grass--Gardener's Garters we called it. Clumps of it growing at\r\nVan Cortlandt Manor are here shown. We children used to run to the great\r\nplants of Striped Grass at the end of the garden as to a toy ribbon\r\nshop. The long blades of Grass looked like some antique gauze ribbons.\r\nThey were very modish for dolls' wear, very useful to shape\r\npin-a-sights, those very useful things, and very pretty to tie up\r\nposies. Under favorable circumstances this garden child might become a\r\ngarden pest, a spreading weed. I never saw a more curious garden stray\r\nthan an entire dooryard and farm garden--certainly two acres in extent,\r\ncovered with Striped Grass, save where a few persistent Tiger Lilies\r\npierced through the striped leaves. Even among the deserted hearthstones\r\nand tumble-down chimneys the striped leaves ran up among the roofless\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nLet me state here that the suggestion of mystery in a flower did not\r\nalways make me dislike it; sometimes it added a charm. The\r\nPeriwinkle--Ground Myrtle we used to call it--was one of the most\r\nmysterious and elusive flowers I knew, and other children thus regarded\r\nit; but I had a deep affection for its lovely blue stars and clean,\r\nglossy leaves, a special love, since it was the first flower I saw\r\nblooming out of doors after a severe illness, and it seemed to welcome\r\nme back to life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gardener's Garters, at Van Cortlandt Manor.]\r\n\r\nThe name is from the French Pervenche, which suffers sadly by being\r\nchanged into the clumsy Periwinkle. Everywhere it is a flower of\r\nmystery; it is the \"Violette des Sorciers\" of the French. Sadder is its\r\nTuscan name, \"Flower of death,\" for it is used there as garlands at the\r\nburial of children; and is often planted on graves, just as it is here.\r\nA far happier folk-name was Joy-of-the-ground, and to my mind better\r\nsuited to the cheerful, healthy little plant.\r\n\r\nAn ancient medical manuscript gives this description of the Periwinkle,\r\nwhich for directness and lucidity can scarcely be excelled:--\r\n\r\n    \"Parwyke is an erbe grene of colour,\r\n     In tyme of May he bereth blue flour.\r\n     Ye lef is thicke, schinede and styf,\r\n     As is ye grene jwy lefe.\r\n     Vnder brod and uerhand round,\r\n     Men call it ye joy of grownde.\"\r\n\r\nOn the list of the Boston seedsman (given on page 33 _et seq._) is\r\nVenus'-navelwort. I lingered this summer by an ancient front yard in\r\nMarblehead, and in the shade of the low-lying gray-shingled house I saw\r\na refined plant with which I was wholly unacquainted, lying like a\r\nlittle dun cloud on the border, a pleasing plant with cinereous foliage,\r\nin color like the silvery gray of the house, shaded with a bluer tint\r\nand bearing a dainty milk-white bloom. This modest flower had that power\r\nof catching the attention in spite of the high and striking colors of\r\nits neighbors, such as a simple gown of gray and white, if of graceful\r\ncut and shape, will have among gay-colored silk attire--the charm of\r\nQuaker garb, even though its shape be ugly. You know how ready is the\r\nowner of such a garden to talk of her favorites, and soon I was told\r\nthat this plant was \"Navy-work.\" I accepted this name in this old\r\nmaritime town as possibly a local folk-name, yet I was puzzled by a\r\nhaunting memory of having heard some similar title. A later search in a\r\nbotany revealed the original, Venus'-navelwort.\r\n\r\nI deem it right to state in this connection that any such corruption of\r\nthe old name of a flower is very unusual in Massachusetts, where the\r\nEnglish tongue is spoken by all of Massachusetts descent in much purity\r\nof pronunciation.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that all the flowers of the old garden were far more\r\nsuggestive, more full of meaning, than those given to us by modern\r\nflorists. This does not come wholly from association, as many fancy, but\r\nfrom an inherent quality of the flower itself. I never saw Honeywort\r\n(Cerinthe) till five years ago, and then it was not in an old-fashioned\r\ngarden; but the moment I beheld the graceful, drooping flowers in the\r\nflower bed, the yellow and purple-toothed corolla caught my eye, as it\r\ncaught my fancy; it seemed to mean something. I was not surprised to\r\nlearn that it was an ancient favorite of colonial days. The leaves of\r\nHoneywort are often lightly spotted, which may be one of its elements of\r\nmystery. Honeywort is seldom seen even in our oldest gardens; but it is\r\na beautiful flower and a most hardy annual, and deserves to be\r\nreintroduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden Walk at The Manse, Deerfield, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nA great favorite in the old garden was the splendid scarlet Lychnis, to\r\nwhich in New England is given the name of London Pride. There are two\r\nold varieties: one has four petals with squared ends, and is called,\r\nfrom the shape of the expanded flower, the Maltese Cross; the other,\r\ncalled Scarlet Lightning, is shown on a succeeding page; it has five\r\ndeeply-nicked petals. It is a flower of midsummer eve and magic power,\r\nand I think it must have some connection with the Crusaders, being\r\ncalled by Gerarde Floure of Jerusalem, and Flower of Candy. The\r\nfive-petalled form is rarely seen; in one old family I know it is so\r\ncherished, and deemed so magic a home-maker, that every bride who has\r\ngone from that home for over a hundred years has borne away a plant of\r\nthat London Pride; it has really become a Family Pride.\r\n\r\nAnother plant of mysterious suggestion was the common Plantain. This was\r\nnot an unaided instinct of my childhood, but came to me through an\r\nexplanation of the lines in the chapter, \"The White Man's Foot,\" in\r\n_Hiawatha_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Whereso'er they tread, beneath them\r\n     Springs a flower unknown among us;\r\n     Springs the White Man's Foot in blossom.\"\r\n\r\nAfter my father showed me the Plantain as the \"White Man's Foot,\" I ever\r\nregarded it with a sense of its unusual power; and I used often to\r\nwonder, when I found it growing in the grass, who had stepped there. I\r\nhave permanently associated with the Plantain or Waybred a curious and\r\ndistasteful trick of my memory. We recall our American humorist's\r\nlament over the haunting lines from the car-conductor's orders, which\r\nfilled his brain and ears from the moment he read them, wholly by\r\nchance, and which he tried vainly to forget. A similar obsession filled\r\nme when I read the spirited apostrophe to the Plantain or Waybred, in\r\nCockayne's translation of AElfric's _Lacunga_, a book of leech-craft of\r\nthe eleventh century:--\r\n\r\n    \"And thou Waybroad,\r\n     Mother of worts,\r\n     Over thee carts creaked,\r\n     Over thee Queens rode,\r\n     Over thee brides bridalled,\r\n     Over thee bulls breathed,\r\n     All these thou withstoodst,\r\n     Venom and vile things,\r\n     And all the loathly things,\r\n     That through the land rove.\"\r\n\r\nI could not thrust them out of my mind; worse still, I kept\r\nmanufacturing for the poem scores of lines of similar metre. I never\r\nshall forget the Plantain, it won't let me forget it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: London Pride.]\r\n\r\nThe Orpine was a flower linked with tradition and mystery in England,\r\nthere were scores of fanciful notions connected with it. It has grown to\r\nbe a spreading weed in some parts of New England, but it has lost both\r\nits mystery and its flowers. The only bed of flowering Orpine I ever saw\r\nin America was in the millyard of Miller Rose at Kettle Hole--and a\r\nreally lovely expanse of bloom it was, broken only by old worn\r\nmillstones which formed the doorsteps. He told with pride that his\r\ngrandmother planted it, and \"it was the flowering variety that no one\r\nelse had in Rhode Island, not even in greenhouses in Newport.\" Miller\r\nRose ground corn meal and flour with ancient millstones, and infinitely\r\nbetter were his grindings than \"store meal.\" He could tell you, with\r\nprolonged detail, of the new-fangled roller he bought and used one week,\r\nand not a decent Johnny-cake could be made from the meal, and it shamed\r\nhim. So he threw away all the meal he hadn't sold; and then the new\r\nmachinery was pulled out and the millstones replaced, \"to await the\r\nLord's coming,\" he added, being a Second Adventist--or by his own title\r\na \"Christadelphian and an Old Bachelor.\" He was a famous preacher,\r\nhaving a pulpit built of heavy stones, in the woods near his mill. A\r\nlittle trying it was to hear the outpourings of his long sermons on\r\nsummer afternoons, while you waited for him to come down from his pulpit\r\nand his prophesyings to give you your bag of meal. A tithing of time he\r\ngave each day to the Lord, two hours and a half of preaching--and\r\ndoubtless far more than a tithe of his income to the poor. In\r\nsentimental association with his name, he had a few straggling Roses\r\naround his millyard--all old-time varieties; and, with Orpine and\r\nSweetbrier, he could gather a very pretty posy for all who came to\r\nKettle Hole.\r\n\r\nWe constantly read of Fritillaries in the river fields sung of Matthew\r\nArnold. In a charming book of English country life, _Idlehurst_, I read\r\nhow closely the flower is still associated with Oxford life, recalling\r\never the Iffley and Kensington meadows to all Oxford men. The author\r\ntells that \"quite unlikely sorts of men used to pick bunches of the\r\nflowers, and we would come up the towpath with our spoils.\" Fritillaries\r\ngrew in my mother's garden; I cannot now recall another garden in\r\nAmerica where I have ever seen them in bloom. They certainly are not\r\ncommon. On a succeeding page are shown the blossoms of the white\r\nFritillary my mother planted and loved. Can you not believe that we love\r\nthem still? They have spread but little, neither have they dwindled nor\r\ndied. Each year they seem to us the very same blossoms she loved.\r\n\r\nOur cyclopaedias of gardening tell us that the Fritillaries spread\r\nfreely; but E. V. B. writes of them in her exquisite English: \"Slow in\r\ngrowth as the Fritillaries are, they are ever sure. When they once take\r\nroot, there they stay forever, with a constancy unknown in our human\r\nworld. They may be trusted, however late their coming. In the fresh\r\nvigor of its youth was there ever seen any other flower planned so\r\nexquisitely, fashioned so slenderly! The pink symmetry of Kalmia perhaps\r\ncomes nearest this perfection, with the delicately curved and rounded\r\nangles of its bloom.\"\r\n\r\nIn no garden, no matter how modern, could the Fritillaries ever look to\r\nme aught but antique and classic. They are as essentially of the past,\r\neven to the careless eye, as an antique lamp or brazier. Quaint, too, is\r\nthe fabric of their coats, like some old silken stuff of paduasoy or\r\nsarsenet. All are checkered, as their name indicates. Even the white\r\nflowers bear little birthmarks of checkered lines. They were among the\r\nfamous dancers in my mother's garden, and I can tell you that a country\r\ndance of Fritillaries in plaided kirtles and green caps is a lively\r\nsight. Another name for this queer little flower is Guinea-hen Flower.\r\nGerarde, with his felicity of description, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"One square is of a greenish-yellow colour, the other purple,\r\n     keeping the same order as well on the back side of the flower as on\r\n     the inside; although they are blackish in one square, and of a\r\n     violet colour in another: in so much that every leafe (of the\r\n     flower) seemeth to be the feather of a Ginnie hen, whereof it took\r\n     its name.\"\r\n\r\nA strong personal trait of the Fritillaries (for I may so speak of\r\nflowers I love) is their air of mystery. They mean something I cannot\r\nfathom; they look it, but cannot tell it. Fritillaries were a flower of\r\nsignificance even in Elizabethan days. They were made into little\r\nbuttonhole posies, and, as Parkinson says, \"worn abroad by curious\r\nlovers of these delights.\" In California grow wild a dozen varieties;\r\nthe best known of these is recurved, but it does not droop, and is to\r\nall outward glance an Anemone, and has lost in that new world much the\r\nmystery of the old herbalist's \"Checker Lily,\" save the checkers; these\r\nalways are visible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White Fritillaria.]\r\n\r\nThe Cyclamen and Dodecatheon lay their ears back like a vicious horse.\r\nBoth have an eerie aspect, as if turned upside down, as has also the\r\nNightshade. I knew a little child, a flower lover from babyhood, who\r\nfeared to touch the Cyclamen, and even cried if any attempt was made to\r\nhave her touch the flower. When older, she said that she had feared the\r\nflower would sting her.\r\n\r\nI have often a sense of mysterious meaning in a vine, it seems so\r\nplainly to reach out to attract your attention. I recall once being\r\nseated on the doorstep of a deserted farm-house, musing a little over\r\nthe sad thought of this lost home, when suddenly some one tapped me on\r\nthe cheek--I suppose I ought to say some thing, though it seemed a human\r\ntouch. It was a spray of Matrimony vine, twenty feet long or more, that\r\nhad reached around a corner, and helped by a breeze, had appealed to me\r\nfor sympathy and companionship. I answered by following it around the\r\ncorner. It had been trained up to a little shelf-like ledge or roof,\r\nover what had been a pantry window, and hung in long lines of heavy\r\nshade. It said to me: \"Here once lived a flower-loving woman and a man\r\nwho cared for her comfort and pleasure. She planted me when she, and the\r\nman, and the house were young, and he made the window shelter, and\r\ntrained me over it, to make cool and green the window where she worked.\r\nI was the symbol of their happy married love. See! there they lie, under\r\nthe gray stone beneath those cedars. Their children all are far away,\r\nbut every year I grow fresh and green, though I find it lonely here\r\nnow.\" To me, the Matrimony vine is ever a plant of interest, and it may\r\nbe very beautiful, if cared for. On page 186 is shown the lovely growth\r\non the porch at Van Cortlandt Manor.\r\n\r\nWith a sentiment of wonder and inquiry, not unmixed with mystery, do we\r\nregard many flowers, which are described in our botanies as Garden\r\nEscapes. This Matrimony vine is one of the many creeping, climbing\r\nthings that have wandered away from houses. Honeysuckles and\r\nTrumpet-vines are far travellers. I saw once in a remote and wild spot\r\na great boulder surrounded with bushes and all were covered with the old\r\nCoral or Trumpet Honeysuckle; it had such a familiar air, and yet seemed\r\nto have gained a certain knowingness by its travels.\r\n\r\nThis element of mystery does not extend to the flowers which I am told\r\nonce were in trim gardens, but which I have never seen there, such as\r\nOx-eye Daisies, Scotch Thistles, Chamomile, Tansy, Bergamot, Yarrow, and\r\nall of the Mint family; they are to me truly wild. But when I find\r\nflowers still cherished in our gardens, growing also in some wild spot,\r\nI regard them with wonder. A great expanse of Coreopsis, a field of\r\nGrape Hyacinth or Star of Bethlehem, roadsides of Coronilla or\r\nMoneywort, rows of red Day Lily and Tiger Lily, patches of Sunflowers or\r\nJerusalem Artichokes, all are matters of thought; we long to trace their\r\nwanderings, to have them tell whence and how they came. Bouncing Bet is\r\ntoo cheerful and rollicking a wanderer to awaken sentiment. How gladly\r\nhas she been welcomed to our fields and roadsides. I could not willingly\r\nspare her in our country drives, even to become again a cherished garden\r\ndweller. She rivals the Succory in beautifying arid dust heaps and\r\nbarren railroad cuts, with her tender opalescent pink tints. How\r\nwholesome and hearty her growth, how pleasant her fragrance. We can\r\nnever see her too often, nor ever stigmatize her, as have been so many\r\nof our garden escapes, as \"Now a dreaded weed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bouncing Bet.]\r\n\r\nOne of the weirdest of all flowers to me is the Butter-and-eggs, the\r\nToad-flax, which was once a garden child, but has run away from gardens\r\nto wander in every field in the land. I haven't the slightest reason for\r\nthis regard of Butter-and-eggs, and I believe it is peculiar to myself,\r\njust as is Dr. Forbes Watson's regard of the Marshmallow to him. I have\r\nno uncanny or sad associations with it, and I never heard anything\r\n\"queer\" about it. Thirty years ago, in a locality I knew well in central\r\nMassachusetts, Butter-and-eggs was far from common; I even remember the\r\nfirst time I saw it and was told its quaint name; now it grows there and\r\neverywhere; it is a persistent weed. John Burroughs calls it \"the\r\nhateful Toad-flax,\" and old Manasseh Cutler, in a curious mixture of\r\ncompliment and slur, \"a common, handsome, tedious weed.\" It travels\r\nabove ground and below ground, and in some soils will run out the grass.\r\nIt knows how to allure the bumblebee, however, and has honey in its\r\nheart. I think it a lovely flower, though it is queer; and it is a\r\ndelight to the scientific botanist, in the delicate perfection of its\r\nmethods and means of fertilization.\r\n\r\nThe greatest beauty of this flower is in late autumn, when it springs up\r\ndensely in shaven fields. I have seen, during the last week in October,\r\nfields entirely filled with its exquisite sulphur-yellow tint, one of\r\nthe most delicate colors in nature; a yellow that is luminous at night,\r\nand is rivalled only by the pale yellow translucent leaves of the\r\nMoosewood in late autumn, which make such a strange pallid light in old\r\nforests in the North--a light which dominates over every other autumn\r\ntint, though the trees which bear them are so spindling and low, and\r\nlittle noted save in early spring in their rare pinkness, and in this\r\ntheir autumn etherealization. And the Moosewood shares the mystery of\r\nthe Butter-and-eggs as well as its color. I should be afraid to drive or\r\nwalk alone in a wood road, when the Moosewood leaves were turning yellow\r\nin autumn. I shall never forget them in Dublin, New Hampshire, driving\r\nthrough what our delightful Yankee charioteer and guide called \"only a\r\ncat-road.\"\r\n\r\nThis was to me a new use of the word cat as a praenomen, though I knew,\r\nas did Dr. Holmes and Hosea Biglow, and every good New Englander, that\r\n\"cat-sticks\" were poor spindling sticks, either growing or in a load of\r\ncut wood. I heard a country parson say as he regarded ruefully a gift of\r\na sled load of firewood, \"The deacon's load is all cat-sticks.\" Of\r\ncourse a cat-stick was also the stick used in the game of ball called\r\ntip-cat. Myself when young did much practise another loved ball game,\r\n\"one old cat,\" a local favorite, perhaps a local name. \"Cat-ice,\" too,\r\nis a good old New England word and thing; it is the thin layer of\r\nbrittle ice formed over puddles, from under which the water has\r\nafterward receded. If there lives a New Englander too old or too hurried\r\nto rejoice in stepping upon and crackling the first \"cat-ice\" on a late\r\nautumn morning, then he is a man; for no New England girl, a century\r\nold, could be thus indifferent. It is akin to rustling through the\r\ndeep-lying autumn leaves, which affords a pleasure so absurdly\r\ndisproportioned and inexplicable that it is almost mysterious. Some of\r\nus gouty ones, alas! have had to give up the \"cat-slides\" which were\r\nalso such a delight; the little stretches of glare ice to which we ran a\r\nfew steps and slid rapidly over with the impetus. But I must not let my\r\nNew England folk-words lure me away from my subject, even on a tempting\r\n\"cat-slide.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Overgrown Garden at Llanerck, Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nThough garden flowers run everywhere that they will, they are not easily\r\nforced to become wild flowers. We hear much of the pleasure of sowing\r\ngarden seeds along the roadside, and children are urged to make\r\nbeautiful wild gardens to be the delight of passers-by. Alphonse Karr\r\nwrote most charmingly of such sowings, and he pictured the delight and\r\nsurprise of country folk in the future when they found the choice\r\nblooms, and the confusion of learned botanists in years to come. The\r\ndelight and surprise and confusion would have been if any of his seeds\r\nsprouted and lived! A few years ago a kindly member of our United States\r\nCongress sent to me from the vast seed stores of our national\r\nAgricultural Department, thousands of packages of seeds of common garden\r\nflowers to be given to the poor children in public kindergartens and\r\nprimary schools in our great city. The seeds were given to hundreds of\r\neager flower lovers, but starch boxes and old tubs and flower pots\r\nformed the limited gardens of those Irish and Italian children, and the\r\nGovernment had sent to me such \"hats full, sacks full, bushel-bags\r\nfull,\" that I was left with an embarrassment of riches. I sent them to\r\nNarragansett and amused myself thereafter by sowing several pecks of\r\ngarden seeds along the country roadsides; never, to my knowledge, did\r\none seed live and produce a plant. I watched eagerly for certain\r\nplantings of Poppies, Candytuft, Morning-glories, and even the\r\nindomitable Portulaca; not one appeared. I don't know why I should think\r\nI could improve on nature; for I drove through that road yesterday and\r\nit was radiant with Wild Rose bloom, white Elder, and Meadow Beauty; a\r\ncombination that Thoreau thought and that I think could not be excelled\r\nin a cultivated garden. Above all, these are the right things in the\r\nright place, which my garden plants would not have been. I am sure\r\nthat if they had lived and crowded out these exquisite wild flowers I\r\nshould have been sorry enough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fountain at Yaddo.]\r\n\r\nThe hardy Colchicum or Autumnal Crocus is seldom seen in our gardens;\r\nnor do I care for its increase, even when planted in the grass. It bears\r\nto me none of the delight which accompanies the spring Crocus, but seems\r\nto be out of keeping with the autumnal season. Rising bare of leaves, it\r\nhas but a seminatural aspect, as if it had been stuck rootless in the\r\nground like the leafless, stemless blooms of a child's posy bed. Its\r\nEnglish name--Naked Boys--seems suited to it. The Colchicum is\r\nassociated in my mind with the Indian Pipe and similar growths; it is\r\ncurious, but it isn't pleasing. As the Indian Pipe could not be lured\r\nwithin garden walls, I will not write of it here, save to say that no\r\none could ever see it growing in its shadowy home in the woods without\r\nyielding to its air of mystery. It is the weirdest flower that grows, so\r\npalpably ghastly that we feel almost a cheerful satisfaction in the\r\nperfection of its performance and our own responsive thrill, just as we\r\ndo in a good ghost story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Avenue of White Pines at Wellesley, Mass., the\r\nCountry-seat of Hollis H. Hunnewell, Esq.]\r\n\r\nMany wild flowers which we have transplanted to our gardens are full of\r\nmagic and charm. In some, such as Thyme and Elder, these elements come\r\nfrom English tradition. In other flowers the quality of mystery is\r\ninherent. In childhood I absolutely abhorred Bloodroot; it seemed to me\r\na fearsome thing when first I picked it. I remember well my dismay, it\r\nwas so pure, so sleek, so innocent of face, yet bleeding at a touch,\r\nlike a murdered man in the Blood Ordeal.\r\n\r\nThe Trillium, Wake-robin, is a wonderful flower. I have seen it growing\r\nin a luxuriance almost beyond belief in lonely Canadian forests on the\r\nLaurentian Mountains. At this mining settlement, so remote that it was\r\nunvisited even by the omnipresent and faithful Canadian priest, was a\r\nwealth of plant growth which seemed fairly tropical. The starry flowers\r\nof the Trillium hung on long peduncles, and the two-inch diameter of the\r\nordinary blossom was doubled. The Painted Trillium bore rich flowers of\r\npink and wine color, and stood four or five feet from the ground. I\r\nthink no one had ever gathered their blooms, for there were no women in\r\nthis mining camp save a few French-Indian servants and one Irish cook,\r\nand no educated white woman had ever been within fifty, perhaps a\r\nhundred, miles of the place. Every variety of bloom seemed of\r\nexaggerated growth, but the Trillium exceeded all. An element of mystery\r\nsurrounds this plant, a quality which appertains to all \"three-cornered\"\r\nflowers; perhaps there may be some significance in the three-sided\r\nform. I felt this influence in the extreme when in the presence of this\r\nCanadian Trillium, so much so that I was depressed by it when wandering\r\nalone even in the edge of the forest; and when by light o' the moon I\r\npeered in on this forest garden, it was like the vision of a troop of\r\ntrembling white ghosts, stimulating to the fancy. It was but a part of\r\nthe whole influence of that place, which was full of eerie mystery. For\r\nafter the countless eons of time during which \"the earth was without\r\nform and void, and darkness was upon the face of the earth,\" the waters\r\nat last were gathered together and dry land appeared. And that dry land\r\nwhich came up slowly out of the face of the waters was this Laurentian\r\nrange. And when at God's command \"on the third day\" the earth brought\r\nforth grass, and herb yielded seed--lo, among the things which were good\r\nand beautiful there shone forth upon the earth the first starry flowers\r\nof the white Trillium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nROSES OF YESTERDAY\r\n\r\n    \"Each morn a thousand Roses brings, you say;\r\n     Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n    --_Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam_, translated by EDWARD FITZGERALD, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer can be given the Persian poet that the Rose of Yesterday\r\nleaves again in the heart. The subtle fragrance of a Rose can readily\r\nconjure in our minds a dream of summers past, and happy summers to come.\r\nMany a flower lover since Chaucer has felt as did the poet:--\r\n\r\n    \"The savour of the Roses swote\r\n     Me smote right to the herte rote.\"\r\n\r\nThe old-time Roses possess most fully this hidden power. Sweetest of all\r\nwas the old Cabbage Rose--called by some the Provence Rose--for its\r\nperfume \"to be chronicled and chronicled, and cut and chronicled, and\r\nall-to-be-praised.\" Its odor is perfection; it is the standard by which\r\nI compare all other fragrances. It is not too strong nor too cloying, as\r\nare some Rose scents; it is the idealization of that distinctive\r\nsweetness of the Rose family which other Roses have to some degree. The\r\ncolor of the Cabbage Rose is very warm and pleasing, a clear, happy\r\npink, and the flower has a wholesome, open look; but it is not a\r\nbeautiful Rose by florists' standards,--few of the old Roses are,--and\r\nit is rather awkward in growth. The Cabbage Rose is said to have been a\r\nfavorite in ancient Rome. I wish it had a prettier name; it is certainly\r\nworthy one.\r\n\r\nThe Hundred-leaved Rose was akin to the Cabbage Rose, and shared its\r\ndelicious fragrance. In its rather irregular shape it resembled the\r\npresent Duke of Sussex Rose.\r\n\r\nOne of the rarest of old-time Roses in our gardens to-day is the red and\r\nwhite mottled York and Lancaster. It is as old as the sixteenth century.\r\nShakespeare writes in the _Sonnets_:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Roses fearfully in thorns did stand\r\n     One blushing shame, another white despair.\r\n     A third, nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both.\"\r\n\r\nThey are what Chaucer loved, \"sweitie roses red, brode, and open also.\"\r\nRoses of a broad, flat expanse when in full bloom; they have a cheerier,\r\nheartier, more gracious look than many of the new Roses that never open\r\nfar from bud, that seem so pinched and narrow. What ineffable fragrance\r\ndo they pour out from every wide-open flower, a fragrance that is the\r\nvery spirit of the Oriental Attar of Roses; all the sensuous sweetness\r\nof the attar is gone, and only that which is purest and best remains. I\r\nbelieve, in thinking of it, that it equals the perfume of the Cabbage\r\nRose, which, ere now, I have always placed first. This York and\r\nLancaster Rose is the _Rosa mundi_,--the rose of the world. A fine plant\r\nis growing in Hawthorne's old home in Salem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Violets in Silver Double Coaster.]\r\n\r\nOpposite page 462 is an unusual depiction of the century-old York and\r\nLancaster Rose still growing and flourishing in the old garden at Van\r\nCortlandt Manor. It is from one of the few photographs which I have ever\r\nseen which make you forgive their lack of color. The vigor, the grace,\r\nthe richness of this wonderful Rose certainly are fully shown, though\r\nbut in black and white. I have called this Rose bush a century old; it\r\nis doubtless much older, but it does not seem old; it is gifted with\r\neverlasting youth. We know how the Persians gather before a single plant\r\nin flower; they spread their rugs, and pray before it; and sit and\r\nmeditate before it; sip sherbet, play the lute and guitar in the\r\nmoonlight; bring their friends and stand as in a vision, then talk in\r\npraises of it, and then all serenade it with an ode from Hafiz and\r\ndepart. So would I gather my friends around this lovely old Rose, and\r\nshare its beauty just as my friends at the manor-house share it with me;\r\nand as the Persians, we would praise it in sunlight and by moonlight,\r\nand sing its beauty in verses. This York and Lancaster Rose was known to\r\nParkinson in his day; it is his _Rosa versicolor_. I wonder why so few\r\nmodern gardens contain this treasure. I know it does not rise to all the\r\nstandards of the modern Rose growers; but it possesses something\r\nbetter--it has a living spirit; it speaks of history, romance,\r\nsentiment; it awakens inspiration and thought, it has an ever living\r\ninterest, a significance. I wonder whether a hundred years from now any\r\none will stand before some Crimson Rambler, which will then be ancient,\r\nand feel as I do before this York and Lancaster goddess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: York and Lancaster Rose.]\r\n\r\nThe fragrance of the sweetest Roses--the Damask, the Cabbage, the York\r\nand Lancaster--is beyond any other flower-scent, it is irresistible,\r\nenthralling; you cannot leave it. You can push aside a Syringa, a\r\nHoneysuckle, even a Mignonette, but there is a magic something which\r\nbinds you irrevocably to the Rose. I have never doubted that the Rose\r\nhas some compelling quality shared not by other flowers. I know not\r\nwhether it comes from centuries of establishment as a race-symbol, or\r\nfrom some inherent witchery of the plant, but it certainly exists.\r\n\r\nThe variety of Roses known to old American gardens, as to English\r\ngardens, was few. The English Eglantine was quickly established here in\r\ngardens and spread to roadsides. The small, ragged, cheerful little\r\nCinnamon Rose, now chiefly seen as a garden stray, is undoubtedly old.\r\nThis Rose diffuses its faint \"sinamon smelle\" when the petals are dried.\r\nNearly all of the Roses vaguely thought to be one or two hundred years\r\nold date only, within our ken, to the earlier years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The Seven Sisters Rose, imagined by the owner of many a\r\nSouthern garden to belong to colonial days, is one of the family _Rosa\r\nmultiflora_, introduced from Japan to England by Thunberg. Its catalogue\r\nname is Greville. I think the Seven Sisters dates back to 1822. The\r\nclusters of little double blooms of the Seven Sisters are not among our\r\nbeautiful Roses, but are planted by the house mistress of every Southern\r\nhome from power of association, because they were loved by her\r\ngrandmothers, if not by more distant forbears. The crimson Boursaults\r\nare no older. They came from the Swiss Alps and therefore are hardy, but\r\nthey are fussy things, needing much pruning and pulling out. I recall\r\nthat they had much longer prickles than the other roses in our garden.\r\nThe beloved little Banksia Rose came from China in 1807. The Madame\r\nPlantier is a hybrid China Rose of much popularity. We have had it about\r\nseventy or eighty years. In the lovely garden of Mrs. Mabel Osgood\r\nWright, author of _Flowers and Trees in their Haunts_, I saw, this\r\nspring, a giant Madame Plantier which had over five thousand buds, and\r\nwhich could scarcely be equalled in beauty by any modern Roses. Its\r\nphotograph gives scant idea of its size.\r\n\r\nWhat gratitude we have in spring to the Sweetbrier! How early in the\r\nyear, from sprouting branch and curling leaf, it begins to give forth\r\nits pure odor! Gracious and lavish plant, beloved in scent by every one,\r\nyou have no rival in the spring garden with its pale perfumes. The\r\nSweetbrier and Shakespeare's Musk Rose (_Rosa moschata_) are said to be\r\nthe only Roses that at evening pour forth their perfume; the others are\r\nwhat Bacon called \"fast of their odor.\"\r\n\r\nThe June Rose, called by many the Hedgehog Rose, was, I think, the first\r\nRose of summer. A sturdy plant, about three feet in height; set thick\r\nwith briers, it well deserved its folk name. The flowers opened into a\r\nsaucer of richest carmine, as fragrant as an American Beauty, and the\r\nlittle circles of crimson resembling the _Rosa rugosa_ were seen in\r\nevery front dooryard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cinnamon Roses.]\r\n\r\nIn the Walpole garden from whence came to us our beloved Ambrosia, was\r\nan ample Box-edged flower bed which my mother and the great-aunt called\r\nThe Rosery. One cousin, now living, recalls with distinctness its charms\r\nin 1830; for it was beautiful, though the vast riches of the Rose-world\r\nof China and Japan had not reached it. There grew in it, he remembers,\r\nYellow Scotch Roses, Sweetbrier (or Eglantine), Cinnamon Roses, White\r\nScotch Roses, Damask Roses, Blush Roses, Dog Roses (the Canker-bloom of\r\nShakespeare), Black Roses, Burgundy Roses, and Moss Roses. The\r\nlast-named sensitive creatures, so difficult to rear with satisfaction\r\nin such a climate, found in this Rosery by the river-side some exact\r\nfitness of soil or surroundings, or perhaps of fostering care, which in\r\nspite of the dampness and the constant tendency of all Moss Roses to\r\nmildew, made them blossom in unrivalled perfection. I remember their\r\nsuccessors, deplored as much inferior to the Roses of 1830, and they\r\nwere the finest Moss Roses I ever saw blooming in a garden. An amusing\r\nsaying of some of the village passers-by (with smaller gardens and\r\neducation) showed the universal acknowledgment of the perfection of\r\nthese Roses. These people thought the name was Morse Roses and always\r\nthus termed them, fancying they were named for the family for whom the\r\nflowers bloomed in such beauty and number.\r\n\r\nAmong the other Roses named by my cousin I recall the White Scotch Rose,\r\nsometimes called also the Burnet-leaved Rose. It was very fragrant, and\r\nwas often chosen for a Sunday posy. There were both single and double\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nThe Blush Rose (_Rosa alba_), known also as Maiden's blush, was much\r\nesteemed for its exquisite color; it could be distinguished readily by\r\nthe glaucous hue of the foliage, which always looked like the leaves of\r\nartificial roses. It was easily blighted; and indeed we must acknowledge\r\nthat few of the old Roses were as certain as their sturdy descendants.\r\n\r\nThe Damask Rose was the only one ever used in careful families and by\r\ncareful housekeepers for making rose-water. There was a Velvet Rose,\r\ndarker than the Damask and low-growing, evidently the same Rose. Both\r\nshowed plentiful yellow stamens in the centres, and had exquisite rich\r\ndark leaves.\r\n\r\nThe old Black Rose of The Rosery was so suffused with color-principle,\r\nso \"color-flushing,\" that even the wood had black and dark red streaks.\r\nIts petals were purple-black.\r\n\r\nThe Burgundy Rose was of the Cabbage Rose family; its flowers were very\r\nsmall, scarce an inch in diameter. There were two varieties: the one my\r\ncousin called Little Burgundy had clear dark red blossoms; the other,\r\nwhite with pink centres. Both were low-growing, small bushes with small\r\nleaves. They are practically vanished Roses--wholly out of cultivation.\r\n\r\nWe had other tiny roses; one was a lovely little Rose creature called a\r\nFairy Rose. I haven't seen one for years. As I recall them, the Rose\r\nplants were never a foot in height, and had dainty little flower\r\nrosettes from a quarter to half an inch in diameter set in thick\r\nclusters. But the recalled dimensions of youth vary so when seen\r\nactually in the cold light of to-day that perhaps I am wrong in my\r\ndescription. This was also called a Pony Rose. This Fairy Rose was not\r\nthe Polyantha which also has forty or fifty little roses in a cluster.\r\nThe single Polyantha Rose looks much like its cousin, the Blackberry\r\nblossom.\r\n\r\nAnother small Rose was the Garland Rose. This was deemed extremely\r\nelegant, and rightfully so. It has great corymbs of tiny white blossoms\r\nwith tight little buff buds squeezing out among the open Roses.\r\n\r\nAnother old favorite was the Rose of Four Seasons--known also by its\r\nFrench name, _Rose de Quartre Saisons_--which had occasional blooms\r\nthroughout the summer. It may have been the foundation of our Hybrid\r\nPerpetual Roses. The Bourbon Roses were vastly modish; their round\r\nsmooth petals and oval leaves easily distinguish them from other\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nAmong the several hundred things I have fully planned out to do, to\r\nsolace my old age after I have become a \"centurion,\" is a series of\r\nwater-color drawings of all these old-time Roses, for so many of them\r\nare already scarce.\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Rose which covered the arches in Mr. Seward's garden, has\r\nclusters of deep pink, single, odorless flowers, that fade out nearly\r\nwhite after they open. It is our only native Rose that has passed into\r\ncultivation. From it come many fine double-flowered Roses, among them\r\nthe beautiful Baltimore Belle and Queen of the Prairies, which were\r\nnamed about 1836 by a Baltimore florist called Feast. All its vigorous\r\nand hardy descendants are scentless save the Gem of the Prairies. It is\r\none of the ironies of plant-nomenclature when we have so few plant names\r\nsaved to us from the picturesque and often musical speech of the\r\nAmerican Indians, that the lovely Cherokee Rose, Indian of name, is a\r\nChinese Rose. It ought to be a native, for everywhere throughout our\r\nSouthern states its pure white flowers and glossy evergreen leaves love\r\nto grow till they form dense thickets.\r\n\r\nPeople who own fine gardens are nowadays unwilling to plant the old\r\n\"Summer Roses\" which bloom cheerfully in their own Rose-month and then\r\nhave no more blossoming till the next year; they want a Remontant Rose,\r\nwhich will bloom a second time in the autumn, or a Perpetual Rose, which\r\nwill give flowers from June till cut off by the frost. But these\r\nlatter-named Roses are not only of fine gardens but of fine gardeners;\r\nand folk who wish the old simple flower garden which needs no\r\nhighly-skilled care, still are happy in the old Summer Roses I have\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cottage Garden with Roses.]\r\n\r\nA Rose hedge is the most beautiful of all garden walls and the most\r\nancient. Professor Koch says that long before men customarily surrounded\r\ntheir gardens with walls, that they had Rose hedges. He tells us that\r\neach of the four great peoples of Asia owned its own beloved Rose,\r\ncarried in all wanderings, until at last the four became common to all\r\nraces of men. Indo-Germanic stock chose the hundred-leaved red Rose,\r\n_Rosa gallica_ (the best Rose for conserves). _Rosa damascena_, which\r\nblooms twice a year, and the Musk Rose were cherished by the Semitic\r\npeople; these were preferred for attar of Roses and Rose water. The\r\nyellow Rose, _Rosa lutea_, or Persian Rose, was the flower of the\r\nTurkish Mongolian people. Eastern Asia is the fatherland of the Indian\r\nand Tea Roses. The Rose has now become as universal as sunlight. Even in\r\nIceland and Lapland grows the lovely _Rosa nitida_.\r\n\r\nWe say these Roses are common to all peoples, but we have never in\r\nAmerica been able to grow yellow Roses in ample bloom in our gardens.\r\nMany that thrive in English gardens are unknown here. The only yellow\r\ngarden Rose common in old gardens was known simply as the \"old yellow\r\nRose,\" or Scotch Rose, but it came from the far East. In a few\r\nlocalities the yellow Eglantine was seen.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque old custom of paying a Rose for rent was known here. In\r\nManheim, Pennsylvania, stands the Zion Lutheran Church, which was\r\ngathered together by Baron William Stiegel, who was the first glass and\r\niron manufacturer of note in this country. He came to America in 1750,\r\nwith a fortune which would be equal to-day to a million dollars, and\r\nfounded and built and named Manheim. He was a man of deep spiritual and\r\nreligious belief, and of profound sentiment, and when in 1771 he gave\r\nthe land to the church, this clause was in the indenture:--\r\n\r\n     \"Yielding and paying therefor unto the said Henry William Stiegel,\r\n     his heirs or assigns, at the said town of Manheim, in the Month of\r\n     June Yearly, forever hereafter, the rent of _One Red Rose_, if the\r\n     same shall be lawfully demanded.\"\r\n\r\nNothing more touching can be imagined than the fulfilment each year of\r\nthis beautiful and symbolic ceremony of payment. The little town is rich\r\nin Roses, and these are gathered freely for the church service, when One\r\nRed Rose is still paid to the heirs of the sainted old baron, who died\r\nin 1778, broken in health and fortunes, even having languished in jail\r\nsome time for debt. A new church was erected on the site of the old one\r\nin 1892, and in a beautiful memorial window the decoration of the Red\r\nRose commemorates the sentiment of its benefactor.\r\n\r\nThe Rose Tavern, in the neighboring town of Bethlehem, stands on land\r\ngranted for the site of a tavern by William Penn, for the yearly rental\r\nof One Red Rose.\r\n\r\nIn England the payment of a Rose as rent was often known. The Bishop of\r\nEly leased Ely house in 1576 to Sir Christopher Hatton, Queen\r\nElizabeth's handsome Lord Chancellor, for a Red Rose to be paid on\r\nMidsummer Day, ten loads of hay and ten pounds per annum, and he and his\r\nEpiscopal successors reserved the right of walking in the gardens and\r\ngathering twenty bushels of Roses yearly. In France there was a feudal\r\nright to demand a payment of Roses for the making of Rose water.\r\n\r\nTwo of our great historians, George Bancroft and Francis Parkman, were\r\ngreat rose-growers and rose-lovers. I never saw Mr. Parkman's Rose\r\nGarden, but I remember Mr. Bancroft's well; the Tea Roses were\r\nespecially beautiful. Mr. Bancroft's Rose Garden in its earliest days\r\nhad no rivals in America.\r\n\r\nThe making of potpourri was common in my childhood. While the petals of\r\nthe Cabbage Rose were preferred, all were used. Recipes for making\r\npotpourri exist in great number; I have seen several in manuscript in\r\nold recipe books, one dated 1690. The old ones are much simpler than the\r\nmodern ones, and have no strong spices such as cinnamon and clove, and\r\nno bergamot or mints or strongly scented essences or leaves. The best\r\nrules gave ambergris as one of the ingredients; this is not really a\r\nperfume, but gives the potpourri its staying power. There is something\r\nvery pleasant in opening an old China jar to find it filled with\r\npotpourri, even if the scent has wholly faded. It tells a story of a day\r\nwhen people had time for such things. I read in a letter a century and\r\na half old of a happy group of people riding out to the house of the\r\nprovincial governor of New York; all gathered Rose leaves in the\r\ngovernor's garden, and the governor's wife started the distilling of\r\nthese Rose leaves, in her new still, into Rose water, while all drank\r\nsyllabubs and junkets--a pretty Watteau-ish scene.\r\n\r\nThe hips of wild Roses are a harvest--one unused in America in modern\r\ndays, but in olden times they were stewed with sugar and spices, as were\r\nother fruits. Sauce Saracen, or Sarzyn, was made of Rose hips and\r\nAlmonds pounded together, cooked in wine and sweetened. I believe they\r\nare still cooked by some folks in England, but I never heard of their\r\nuse in America save by one person, an elderly Irish woman on a farm in\r\nNarragansett. Plentiful are the references and rules in old cookbooks\r\nfor cooking Rose hips. Parkinson says: \"Hippes are made into a conserve,\r\nalso a paste like licoris. Cooks and their Mistresses know how to\r\nprepare from them many fine dishes for the Table.\" Gerarde writes\r\ncharacteristically of the Sweetbrier, \"The fruit when it is ripe maketh\r\nmost pleasant meats and banqueting dishes, as tarts and such-like; the\r\nmaking whereof I commit to the cunning cooke, and teeth to eat them in\r\nthe rich man's mouth.\"\r\n\r\nChildren have ever nibbled Rose hips:--\r\n\r\n    \"I fed on scarlet hips and stony haws--\r\n     Hard fare, but such as boyish appetite\r\n     Disdains not.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rose bush furnished another comestible for the children's larder,\r\nthe red succulent shoots of common garden and wild Roses. These were\r\nknown by the dainty name of \"brier candy,\" a name appropriate and\r\ncharacteristic, as the folk-names devised by children frequently are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Madame Plantier Rose.]\r\n\r\nOn the post-road in southern New Hampshire stands an old house, which\r\naccording to its license was once \"improved\" as a tavern, and was famous\r\nfor its ghost and its Roses. The tavern was owned by a family of two\r\nbrothers and two sisters, all unmarried, as was rather a habit in the\r\nMason family; though when any of the tribe did marry, a vast throng of\r\nchildren quickly sprung up to propagate the name and sturdy qualities of\r\nthe race. The men were giants, and both men and women were hard-working\r\nfolk of vast endurance and great thrift, and, like all of that ilk in\r\nNew England, they prospered and grew well-to-do; great barns and\r\nout-buildings, all well filled, stretched down along the roadside below\r\nthe house. Joseph Mason could lay more feet of stone wall in a day,\r\ncould plough more land, chop down more trees, pull more stumps, than any\r\nother man in New Hampshire. His sisters could bake and brew, make soap,\r\nweed the garden, spin and weave, unceasingly and untiringly. Their\r\ngarden was a source of purest pleasure to them, as well as of hard work;\r\nits borders were so stocked with medicinal herbs that it could supply a\r\ntownship; and its old-time flowers furnished seeds and slips and bulbs\r\nto every other garden within a day's driving distance; but its glory was\r\na garden side to gladden the heart of Omar Khayyam, where two or three\r\nacres of ground were grown over heavily with old-fashioned Roses. These\r\nwere only the common Cinnamon Rose, the beloved Cabbage Rose, and a pale\r\npink, spicily scented, large-petalled, scarcely double Rose, known to\r\nthem as the Apothecaries' Rose. Farmer-neighbors wondered at this waste\r\nof the Masons' good land in this unprofitable Rose crop, but it had a\r\ncertain use. There came every June to this Rose garden all the children\r\nof the vicinity, bearing milk-pails, homespun bags, birch baskets, to\r\ngather Rose petals. They nearly all had Roses at their homes, but not\r\nthe Mason Roses. These Rose leaves were carried carefully to each home,\r\nand were packed in stone jars with alternate layers of brown or scant\r\nmaple sugar. Soon all conglomerated into a gummy, brown, close-grained,\r\nnot over alluring substance to the vision, which was known among the\r\nchildren by the unromantic name of \"Rose tobacco.\" This cloying\r\nconfection was in high repute. It was chipped off and eaten in tiny\r\nbits, and much treasured--as a love token, or reward of good behavior.\r\n\r\nThe Mason house was a tavern. It was not one of the regular\r\nstopping-places on the turnpike road, being rather too near the town to\r\ngather any travel of teamsters or coaches; but passers-by who knew the\r\nhouse and the Masons loved to stop there. Everything in the well-kept,\r\nwell-filled house and barns contributed to the comfort of guests, and it\r\nwas known that the Masons cared more for the company of the traveller\r\nthan for his pay.\r\n\r\nThere was a shadow on this house. The youngest of the family, Hannah,\r\nhad been jilted in her youth, \"shabbed\" as said the country folks. After\r\nseveral years of \"constant company-keeping\" with the son of a neighbor,\r\nduring which time many a linen sheet and tablecloth, many a fine\r\nblanket, had been spun and woven, and laid aside with the tacit\r\nunderstanding that it was part of her wedding outfit, the man had fallen\r\nsuddenly and violently in love with a girl who came from a neighboring\r\ntown to sing a single Sunday in the church choir. He had driven to her\r\nhome the following week, carried her off to a parson in a third town,\r\nmarried her, and brought her to his home in a triumph of enthusiasm and\r\nromance, which quickly fled before the open dislike and reprehension of\r\nhis upright neighbors, who abhorred his fickleness, and before the years\r\nof ill health and ill temper of the hard-worked, faded wife. Many\r\nchildren were born to them; two lived, sickly little souls, who,\r\nunconscious of the blemish on their parents' past, came with the other\r\nchildren every June, and gathered Rose leaves under Hannah Mason's\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nHannah Mason was called crazy. After her desertion she never entered any\r\ndoor save that of her own home, never went to a neighbor's house either\r\nin time of joy or sorrow; queerer still, never went to church. All her\r\nlife, her thoughts, her vast strength, went into hard work. No labor was\r\ntoo heavy or too formidable for her. She would hetchel flax for weeks,\r\nspin unceasingly, and weave on a hand loom, most wearing of women's\r\nwork, without thought of rest. No single household could supply work for\r\nsuch an untiring machine, especially when all labored industriously--so\r\nwork was brought to her from the neighbors. Not a wedding outfit for\r\nmiles around was complete without one of Hannah Mason's fine\r\ntablecloths. Every corpse was buried in one of her linen shrouds.\r\nSailmakers and boat-owners in Portsmouth sent up to her for strong duck\r\nfor their sails. Lads went up to Dartmouth College in suits of her\r\nhomespun. Many a teamster on the road slept under Hannah Mason's heavy\r\ngray woollen blankets, and his wagon tilts were covered with her canvas.\r\nHer bank account grew rapidly--she became rich as fast as her old\r\nlover became poor. But all this cast a shadow on the house. Sojourners\r\nwould waken and hear throughout the night some steady sound, a\r\nscratching of the cards, a whirring of the spinning-wheel, the\r\nthump-thump of the loom. Some said she never slept, and could well grow\r\nrich when she worked all night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sun-dial and Roses at Van Cortlandt Manor.]\r\n\r\nAt last the woman who had stolen her lover--the poor, sickly wife--died.\r\nThe widower, burdened hopelessly with debts, of course put up in her\r\nmemory a fine headstone extolling her virtues. One wakeful night, with a\r\nsentiment often found in such natures, he went to the graveyard to view\r\nhis proud but unpaid-for possession. The grass deadened his footsteps,\r\nand not till he reached the grave did there rise up from the ground a\r\ntall, ghostly figure dressed all in undyed gray wool of her own weaving.\r\nIt was Hannah Mason. \"Hannah,\" whimpered the widower, trying to take her\r\nhand,--with equal thought of her long bank account and his unpaid-for\r\nheadstone,--\"I never really loved any one but you.\" She broke away from\r\nhim with an indescribable gesture of contempt and dignity, and went\r\nhome. She died suddenly four days later of pneumonia, either from the\r\nshock or the damp midnight chill of the graveyard.\r\n\r\nAs months passed on travellers still came to the tavern, and the story\r\nbegan to be whispered from one to another that the house was haunted by\r\nthe ghost of Hannah Mason. Strange sounds were heard at night from the\r\ngarret where she had always worked; most plainly of all could be heard\r\nthe whirring of her great wool wheel. When this rumor reached the\r\nbrothers' ears, they determined to investigate the story and end it\r\nforever. That night their vigil began, and soon the sound of the wheel\r\nwas heard. They entered the garret, and to their surprise found the\r\nwheel spinning round. Then Joseph Mason went to the garret and seated\r\nhimself for closer and more determined watch. He sat in the dark till\r\nthe wheel began to revolve, then struck a sudden light and found the\r\nghost. A great rat had run out on the spoke of the wheel and when he\r\nreached the broad rim had started a treadmill of his own--which made the\r\nghostly sound as it whirred around. Soon this rat grew so tame that he\r\nwould come out on the spinning-wheel in the daytime, and several others\r\nwere seen to run around in the wheel as if it were a pleasant\r\nrecreation.\r\n\r\nThe old brick house still stands with its great grove of Sugar Maples,\r\nbut it is silent, for the Masons all sleep in the graveyard behind the\r\nchurch high up on the hillside; no travellers stop within the doors, the\r\nghost rats are dead, the spinning-wheel is gone, but the garden still\r\nblossoms with eternal youth. Though children no longer gather rose\r\nleaves for Rose tobacco, the \"Roses of Yesterday\" bloom every year; and\r\neach June morn, \"a thousand blossoms with the day awake,\" and fling\r\ntheir spicy fragrance on the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbotsford, Ivy from, 62;\r\n    sun-dial from, 219, 377.\r\n\r\n  Achillaea, 238.\r\n\r\n  Aconite, 266.\r\n\r\n  Acrelius, Dr., quoted, 208.\r\n\r\n  Adam's Needle. _See_ Yucca.\r\n\r\n  Adlumia, 183.\r\n\r\n  Agapanthus, 52.\r\n\r\n  Ageratum, as edging, 60, 264.\r\n\r\n  Ague-weed, 146.\r\n\r\n  Akers, Elizabeth, quoted, 152.\r\n\r\n  Alcott, A.
