What was rather astonishing was to find Pringleton such a\r\nvery lonely place.\r\n\r\nAs far as he could see, when he had walked around the bungalow-built\r\nstation the light in the stationmaster's ticket office was the only\r\nlight visible save the switch-targets and the disappearing green lamps\r\non the end of the train. Hiram, with his heavy bag, was the only\r\npassenger who had got off the evening train.\r\n\r\nWhen he came around to the front of the station again he saw the\r\nstationmaster humped over his desk in the bay window, with a pen stuck\r\nover his ear, looking for all the world like a secretary bird. He\r\npeered out of the window at Hiram curiously, and finally pushed up the\r\nsash.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether you know it or not, young fellow,\" the\r\nstationmaster said, \"but the company charges mileage if you use this\r\nplatform for a walking track. And you'll make trouble for me if you\r\nkeep going around, for I never have found out how many laps make a\r\nmile, and I sha'n't know what to charge you.\"\r\n\r\nHiram Strong smiled his approval of this brand of humor, yet his\r\nquestion put in reply was quite serious:\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen anybody around here, sir, from a place called Sunnyside\r\nFarm?\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't anybody at Sunnyside Farm, as far as I know,\" said the\r\nstationmaster; \"and there hasn't been since the house burned down last\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" Hiram said quickly. \"But I rather expected Mr. Bronson\r\nwould have somebody over here to meet me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stephen Bronson?\" asked the man. \"Him that's just bought the\r\nSunnyside place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It's quite a walk to the farm, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the longest two miles you ever walked, son,\" declared the\r\nstationmaster. \"Were you thinking to walk it to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"As there is nobody here to meet me, I guess I'll have to,\" replied the\r\nyouth cheerfully. \"Which way do I head? You'll have to start me right,\r\nor else I may wear out your platform walking around and around on it\r\nall night.\"\r\n\r\nThe stationmaster chuckled. \"Well, young fellow,\" he observed, \"it is\r\nevidently to my advantage to put you on your way. Turn around, pick\r\nup your bag, go right down those steps to the road and walk straight\r\nahead. You are now facing west. When you get into the road you will\r\nfind it not so dark as it seems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dark enough, I guess,\" muttered Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"You can't miss the road even on a dark night, for there is no fork in\r\nit till after you pass Sunnyside.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" asked the youth, \"is there anybody up that way who will lodge me\r\nfor the night, as the Sunnyside house is burned?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may get taken in at Miss Delia Pringle's, just beyond\r\nSunnyside--first house after you pass the ruins of the burned\r\nfarmhouse. This station is named after her folks. Don't make the\r\nmistake of going to the first house this side of Sunnyside.\"\r\n\r\nHe said this last so curiously that Hiram asked him: \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because that is Yancey Battick's place. He'll likely blow a charge\r\nof rock salt into you from his shotgun and then ask what you want\r\nafterward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's his idea?\" asked Hiram much amazed.\r\n\r\n\"Says he's afraid of rats--that's all,\" declared the stationmaster, and\r\nimmediately slammed down the window to shut out the searching February\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThe youth hesitated for only a moment longer. He rather thought the\r\nstationmaster of Pringleton was quite as odd as the man he called\r\nYancey Battick, who met all visitors with a salt-loaded shotgun and was\r\nafraid of rats.\r\n\r\n\"And this isn't really a night fit for a rat to be out,\" Hiram\r\nmuttered, after he had walked for some time along the muddy road\r\nleading west from the station.\r\n\r\nOccasionally while he was still near the railroad he passed a dwelling;\r\nbut it was just about supper time, and nearly all the lights were at\r\nthe backs of the houses. Hardly a ray of cheerful lamp light reached\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nThe houses were situated farther apart as he continued his march. The\r\nfine rain was penetrating in the extreme. Hiram desired shelter more\r\nthan he ever had before, it seemed to him.\r\n\r\nAnd just when it appeared as though nothing about his situation could\r\nbe worse, the heavens opened. It had been doing this, off and on, all\r\nday. But this water fall seemed heavier than any of those that had\r\npreceded it.\r\n\r\nHiram Strong saw a light ahead and a little to one side of the road.\r\nIt was not a very bright light (perhaps it was drowned by the curtain\r\nof falling rain) but it must be in a house, he thought. At a time like\r\nthis, it was any port in a storm.\r\n\r\nHe set out at a heavy run toward the light. He found a sagging gate in\r\na decrepit fence. Plunging up a muddy path, he reached a tiny porch\r\nwhich might have offered some shelter had not the roof leaked like a\r\nsieve.\r\n\r\n\"Hard luck!\" muttered the youth. \"If they won't let me in--\"\r\n\r\nHis feet pounding on the rickety steps and the thump of his heavy bag\r\non the porch aroused somebody within. Hiram heard a firm step at the\r\nother side of the door.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door opened with an abruptness which was startling. The\r\ndoor opened on a chain, and through the aperture of about eight inches\r\nwas thrust the brown muzzle of a double-barreled shotgun that, at\r\nthe moment, looked as big as a cannon to the youth. He stepped back\r\npromptly, and a cascade off the roof of the porch went down the back of\r\nhis neck.\r\n\r\n\"What are you after?\" demanded a harsh voice.\r\n\r\nAbove the slanted gun-barrel appeared a ferocious black moustache which\r\ncompletely hid the wearer's mouth, a beak-like nose, and a pair of blue\r\neyes that glittered half wildly. Altogether the householder was of\r\nmost forbidding aspect, and the youth at once identified him as Yancey\r\nBattick. He had evidently stopped at the wrong house after all!\r\n\r\n\"I want nothing, Mr. Battick, but shelter till the rain holds up,\"\r\nHiram answered.\r\n\r\n\"Who told you my name?\" demanded the man. \"I never saw you before,\r\nyoung fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guessed it,\" Hiram replied. \"I'm a pretty good Yankee at guessing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are a Yankee, I imagine,\" the man said. \"You're from the East,\r\naren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Hiram, and mentioned the locality from which he had\r\njust come in answer to Mr. Stephen Bronson's summons.\r\n\r\nThe man still presented the gun, and although Hiram had stepped from\r\nunder the cascade pouring down from the roof, he was anything but\r\ncomfortable out there on the porch.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Battick, scowling still.\r\n\r\n\"To Sunnyside Farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, there's nobody there! The house is burned down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect to work that place this year for Mr. Stephen Bronson. I\r\nwant to find a place to lodge near the farm, and I was told to apply\r\nto--Miss Pringle, I believe the name is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" gasped the man. \"A young fellow like you? Who sent you unwarned\r\ninto the clutches of that old maid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--is she so bad?\" Hiram asked.\r\n\r\n\"There isn't any male too young nor yet too old to be out of danger of\r\nthat old maid. Come on in,\" added Mr. Battick, unchaining the door. \"I\r\nwouldn't let any male creature get into that woman's clutches.\"\r\n\r\nHiram stepped rather doubtfully into the house. Mr. Yancey Battick\r\ncertainly was a very odd person. He had been warned that the man with\r\nthe welcoming shotgun was afraid of rats; it appeared that he was\r\nlikewise much afraid of spinsters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                           A KERNEL OF WHEAT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" said Yancey Battick, halting Hiram just after he was inside\r\nthe house and the door was closed. \"Who sent you here?\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed a very suspicious man. His blue eyes searched the open\r\ncountenance of the boy from the East, and his expression, with\r\nbristling moustache and all, was fierce indeed.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you I was not sent here at all,\" Hiram explained rather\r\nwearily. \"In fact, I was advised strongly against knocking at your\r\ndoor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who advised you?\" demanded Battick quickly.\r\n\r\n\"The stationmaster.\"\r\n\r\n\"That old thimblerigger, Jason Oakley? Huh! Are you a friend of his?\"\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Mr. Battick was not on friendly terms with many of\r\nhis neighbors. Hiram Strong did not lack common sense. He proposed to\r\nsay nothing to cause the householder to turn him out into the downpour,\r\nwhich was now very severe.\r\n\r\n\"I am just as much a friend of his, Mr. Battick, as I am of yours,\" the\r\nyouth said.\r\n\r\n\"Humph! Well! And I suppose Jason told you to try at Delia Pringle's?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" Battick said again, and finally set the gun in a rack near the\r\nchimney corner.\r\n\r\nAt last Hiram Strong felt as though he could look about the room.\r\nHeretofore his attention had been given to that gun. The door by which\r\nhe had entered opened directly from the porch; there was no entry-way.\r\nThe room seemed to be the entire width of the cottage with a wide\r\nfireplace facing the door, and evidently there was another room behind\r\nthe chimney--perhaps two.\r\n\r\nThis living room was sufficiently interesting--not to say\r\nsurprising--to the visitor to hold his full attention for the time\r\nbeing. The two ends of the room, at the right and left of the doorway,\r\nfirst gained Hiram Strong's interest. At the right the wall was\r\ncompletely masked from floor to ceiling by bookshelves, and those\r\nshelves were filled with books, the nature of which he could not so\r\neasily learn, for the hanging lamp did not thoroughly illuminate the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nAt the other end was a bench upon which were retorts, a\r\nmortar-and-pestle, an alcohol forge, and other implements and\r\ninstruments which suggested chemical--and other--experiments. There\r\nwere, too, racks of seed-boxes for testing. Hiram was thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with these shallow trays.\r\n\r\nBut in the middle of the room was the object that most excited Hiram's\r\ninterest. This was a high table--or so it seemed--its shape something\r\nlike that of a coffin. At least, it was as long as a full length\r\ncasket, about as wide, and was side-boarded like no table Hiram had\r\never seen before. But there was a tarpaulin spread over it. The four\r\nlegs were of round, barked, straight logs four inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nAfter setting the gun in the rack Battick turned toward his visitor\r\nand, though not very graciously, invited him to be seated, pointing to\r\na rustic armchair at the side of the hearth farthest from the gun-rack.\r\n\r\n\"And take off your coat, stranger. What did you say your name was?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is Hiram Strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you say about working Sunnyside for Mr. Bronson?\" continued\r\nthe host. \"I guess you mean you're going to chore around for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope to run the farm for Mr. Bronson.\"\r\n\r\n\"A boy like you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll never be any younger,\" Hiram laughed, for he was rather used to\r\nhaving people cast reflections upon his age. He had had, however, much\r\ngreater experience in practical farming than many men on farms who were\r\ntwice his age.\r\n\r\n\"What do you know about farming?\" asked Battick abruptly. \"What\r\nexperience have you had, Mr. Strong?\"\r\n\r\nHiram smiled slowly. He was by no means a handsome boy, but he was\r\nwholesome looking and his smile was disarming. Even the scowling visage\r\nof Yancey Battick began to smooth out as he watched his visitor. But it\r\nwas plain to be seen that the man was a misanthrope.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" Hiram began, \"my father was a very good farmer indeed,\r\nalthough he farmed for other men all his life. He read a great deal and\r\nstudied farming methods, and I worked right along with him until I was\r\nfourteen. What he learned--at least, a good deal of it--I learned, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" sniffed Battick, \"a boy of that immature age?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father made a friend of me. We were like brothers--chums,\" Hiram\r\nStrong continued. \"Somehow, he was an easy man to learn from--he was\r\npatient.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" muttered Battick. \"Well, I take it your father died?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I had got it into my head that I did not want to be a tenant\r\nfarmer, as he was all his life, and there was no money left. So I went\r\nto town thinking there would be more and better chances for a boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! You were starting out young.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't have any folks,\" explained Hiram. \"I got a job that barely\r\npaid my board and lodging. And I soon got sick of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the job or the city?\" asked Battick, the ghost of a smile passing\r\nover his face as he listened to his involuntary guest and stared into\r\nthe leaping flames on the hearth.\r\n\r\n\"Of both,\" replied Hiram promptly. \"The city is no place for a fellow\r\nwho loves the country as I found I did. Mother Atterson, with whom I\r\nboarded, had eighty acres left her near the town of Scoville, and she\r\nand I made a dicker. I farmed it for her for two years, and when our\r\ncontract ended at Christmas last, I had fixed things so that she could\r\nrun it on a paying basis with the help of a friend of mine, Henry\r\nPollock, and by the aid of Sister, whom Mother Atterson has adopted,\r\nand Lem Camp, who lives with them.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stephen Bronson bought a place near Scoville--\"\r\n\r\n\"He's always buying farms,\" grumbled Battick. \"Got more money than\r\nbrains.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't say that,\" Hiram emphasized in disagreement. \"I do not\r\nbelieve that Mr. Bronson ever invests in a farm without getting a\r\ngood return for his outlay. He did on the old Fleigler place there in\r\nScoville. And he only bought that place to live there for a part of\r\neach year while his daughter, Lettie, is going to school at St. Beris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I've heard he has a daughter that just about leads him around by\r\nthe nose,\" sniffed Battick.\r\n\r\nHiram Strong laughed.\r\n\r\n\"She's a girl that most any man would be willing to be led around by,\r\nby the nose or otherwise,\" he said. \"Lettie Bronson is a mighty pretty\r\ngirl. Anyhow, her father liked my work on the Atterson Eighty; so he\r\nhas made me this offer to come out here to the Middle West and farm\r\nSunnyside for a couple of years.\"\r\n\r\nIn this brief way Hiram Strong had related the more important\r\noccurrences narrated in the first volume of this series, entitled\r\n\"Hiram the Young Farmer; Or, Making the Soil Pay.\" His modest statement\r\nthat \"Mr. Bronson had liked my work on the Atterson Eighty\" scarcely\r\ndescribed the farm owner's enthusiasm, however, or explained why Mr.\r\nBronson had sent for so young a fellow to run his new purchase here at\r\nPringleton near the Ohio River.\r\n\r\nThe rain continued to slap against the old clapboards of the house and\r\nthe limbs of the huge buttonwood tree Hiram had seen in the front yard\r\ncreaked loudly. A long and hard storm threatened, and the outlook for\r\npushing on to Miss Pringle's was not a happy one. The woman would be in\r\nbed before Hiram reached her place.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Battick seemed to have fallen into a brown study and asked no\r\nfurther questions, Hiram felt free to examine the furniture of the\r\nliving room again. The table--if it was a table--was an odd thing. The\r\nyoung man did not know what to make of it.\r\n\r\nThe piece of tarpaulin that covered it was sunk in along the top, and\r\nhe came to the conclusion that there was no real top to the table.\r\nThen, in leaning back in his low chair near the fire, he saw that the\r\nlong frame was bottomed with heavy planks. It was a box on four legs\r\nrather than a table.\r\n\r\nMr. Battick spoke again, in his usual abrupt fashion:\r\n\r\n\"Have you had your supper yet, young fellow?\"\r\n\r\nThe tone could not be called cordial.\r\n\r\n\"I had something to eat on the train,\" replied Hiram indifferently.\r\n\r\n\"On that old accommodation?\" sniffed Battick. \"Case-hardened\r\nsandwiches, I bet.\"\r\n\r\nHiram laughed, but admitted the fact.\r\n\r\n\"I know what it is to ride on that train,\" the man said. \"In spite of\r\nwhat Jase Oakley told you about me, I wouldn't see a man starve--not\r\nright here in my own house,\" added this queer individual, though still\r\ngruffly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the stationmaster did not say anything about you except that you\r\nwere afraid of rats,\" Hiram rejoined, watching Battick slyly, for he\r\nwas very curious about the man.\r\n\r\n\"That's what that old thimblerigger said about me, eh?\" growled\r\nBattick. \"Lucky he don't often come up this way. It might happen that\r\nI should take him for a rat.\"\r\n\r\nHe said it so savagely that Hiram considered it best to say nothing\r\nmore to excite his strange host. Battick brought eggs and bacon and\r\nhalf of a corn pone from a cupboard, preparing the meal deftly at the\r\nopen fire.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Hiram's attention was caught by something on the floor just\r\nunder the nearest corner of the odd table, or box, in the middle of the\r\nroom. It was a tiny, cone-shaped heap of grain--wheat, he thought. It\r\nhad dribbled through the bottom of that box by some tiny hole, it was\r\nplain, and had fallen unnoticed to the floor.\r\n\r\nThere was something odd about this grain--something that immediately\r\nattracted Hiram's particular interest. When Battick's back was turned\r\nhe stooped sideways from his chair and secured one of the kernels\r\nof wheat between his thumb and finger. He placed it in his palm and\r\nstudied it minutely.\r\n\r\nThe kernel of wheat was different from any grain he had ever seen.\r\nFirst of all, it was a very large, plump grain, perfectly formed, and\r\nupon one side was a tiny yet distinct red stripe.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Hiram looked up from the grain in his hand. Battick had made\r\na strange move. He had set the skillet down on the hearth and was\r\nreaching for the shotgun. His eyes seemed to glow and a deep flush was\r\ndiffused over the man's forbidding looking countenance.\r\n\r\nHiram Strong was amazed and startled at his host's appearance.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Mr. Battick?\" cried the visitor. \"What are you\r\ndoing with that gun?\" for the man had seized it now.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" hissed Yancey Battick. \"I think I see a rat!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                            INVENTOR'S LUCK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thought had been impressed upon Hiram Strong's mind from the very\r\nfirst that there was something altogether wrong with Yancey Battick.\r\nHis wild eyes and excited manner now convinced the visitor that this\r\nsuspicion was correct. Battick was not altogether sane. And when he\r\nreached for that rock-salt loaded shotgun the visitor prepared to\r\ndefend himself.\r\n\r\nThe muzzle of the gun swung toward Hiram. The latter slid out of his\r\nchair and darted sideways just as Battick rose up with the butt of\r\nthe gun at his shoulder. The muzzle seemed closely following Hiram's\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThen the man's finger pressed the trigger and the gun roared. It seemed\r\nthat the wind of the charge passed over Hiram's head.\r\n\r\n\"What under the sun are you doing?\" demanded the youth, leaping up and\r\nfacing the householder.\r\n\r\n\"What did you move for?\" retorted Battick. \"I might have got you\r\ninstead of the rat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rat?\" repeated Hiram in some doubt.\r\n\r\nBattick returned the smoking shotgun to its rack and crossed the room\r\nto the workbench. Under it, deep in the shadow of the corner, he found\r\nhis game--a fat, gray rat, still kicking.\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!\" murmured the boy from the East, \"it really was a rat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you think I would be shooting in this old house?\" growled\r\nBattick. \"It's rat-ridden. They give me no peace. They have cost me\r\nmore--well, no use going into that,\" said the man, and so concluded.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram Strong was now immensely interested in this strange\r\nindividual. His fright because of Mr. Battick's reckless use of his\r\nshotgun was soon over. The rats about this ancient cottage certainly\r\nwere very bold. But there must be--there was--a particular reason\r\nwhy the man was afraid of the rats. This fear of which Hiram had\r\nfirst heard from Jason Oakley, the stationmaster, was not merely some\r\nidiosyncrasy of Battick's.\r\n\r\n\"Have you tried poison for the vermin?\" Hiram demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I've tried everything,\" replied the man gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"What makes them so bold?\"\r\n\r\n\"The place was overrun with them when I came on it four years ago. I\r\ncan't keep anything in the barn. Why, they have eaten a good buggy\r\nharness on me! I have to keep my harnesses in my bedroom. I've got an\r\nalarm clock in there and it ticks so loud that it scares them off, I\r\nguess. And, then, I snore. That must keep the creatures on the move.\"\r\n\r\nHiram did not know whether the man was all together in earnest, or not;\r\nbut he had to laugh at this last statement.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't no laughing matter,\" Yancey Battick said, wagging his head.\r\n\"My old horse got a nail in his hoof and I greased it well. Hanged if\r\nthe rascals didn't near eat him up in one night. If he hadn't kicked\r\nand snorted so and woke me up, I guess they would have had the most of\r\nhim eaten before morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what brings them into the house--and so bold? You must be on the\r\nwatch for them continually.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am. Jase Oakley is right. I am afraid of the things. I scarcely dare\r\nleave the house because of them--\"\r\n\r\nHe halted. Hiram knew instinctively that the man thought he had said\r\ntoo much. He had verged on some secret, the mystery of which the youth\r\nhad felt to be in the very air of the house since he had entered it. He\r\nsaw that Battick was eyeing him again in his suspicious, if not ugly,\r\nway, so he hastily asked:\r\n\r\n\"Did you learn to shoot on the fly like that by shooting rats?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I knew how to use a gun before I came to Pringleton.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got good eyesight. I did not see that rat at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw the glint of his eyes under the bench.\" Battick was again\r\ngiving his attention to the preparations for supper. \"I've got so I am\r\ncontinually on the watch for the rascals.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he did not dare leave the house because of them! Then, decided\r\nHiram Strong, there was something in the house that he feared the rats\r\nwould destroy.\r\n\r\nHiram looked under the odd box in the middle of the room at the little\r\nheap of grain that lay there. Wheat! A special kind of wheat! The\r\nseed-boxes on the bench told something. Hiram could guess more. But he\r\nsaid nothing at the moment. In fact Yancey Battick was scarcely a man\r\nto whom one would address a personal remark or ask a direct question\r\nabout himself or his affairs.\r\n\r\nYancey Battick brought a small stand from one corner of the room and\r\nset it before the fire. He spread a clean, if coarse, cloth upon it,\r\nand then the tableware, such as a camper would use. The smoking food,\r\ntogether with a pot of coffee, came on the table, and Battick beckoned\r\nHiram to draw up his chair.\r\n\r\n\"This is mighty good of you, Mr. Battick,\" the visitor said,\r\n\"especially when I know you do not make a practice of harboring\r\nwayfarers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope I shall not be sorry for having befriended you,\" the man said\r\ngloomily.\r\n\r\n\"I assure you--\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't assure me of anything,\" interrupted Battick. \"I have had\r\nsufficient experience to make me a thorough pessimist. You look like a\r\nnice young fellow; but I shall not be surprised if I am, in the end,\r\nvery sorry that I took you in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even to save me from the clutches of Miss Delia Pringle?\" the visitor\r\nsuggested slyly.\r\n\r\nThere came a sudden twinkle into Yancey Battick's eye. Whether or not\r\nhe was a monomaniac on some subject (and Hiram Strong was tempted to\r\nbelieve he was) it was evident that the man appreciated a joke. He\r\nnodded his appreciation of Hiram's words.\r\n\r\n\"That woman is a pest!\" Battick said with vigor. \"But I guess she is\r\nhonest--wouldn't steal anything but an unsophisticated and helpless\r\nman-critter, I mean.\"\r\n\r\nSo it was stealing that he was afraid of! Rats are great thieves. Hiram\r\nguessed again--and believed he had hit the fundamental trouble with his\r\nodd host. Battick had originated, or developed, a new seed-wheat. He\r\nfeared somebody would steal it from him, and the rats were doing so.\r\n\r\nThe rats were so troublesome that he had to keep the wheat in his\r\nliving room. This table-looking thing was a box full of wheat. And\r\nbecause the rats were so bold he dared not leave the house. Even with\r\nall these precautions the thieving creatures were getting some of the\r\nwheat, as note that little pile of grain under the box on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe young fellow from Scoville was interested in more than one way.\r\nFirst of all, Battick himself aroused his curiosity. But that single\r\nkernel of wheat he had picked up interested Hiram Strong much more.\r\n\r\nHe had examined many samples of seed-wheat, but nothing that had ever\r\nlooked like this large, plump grain with the tiny crimson stripe upon\r\nit This was indeed a distinct variety, and if its culture was possible\r\non all wheat lands, and it milled all right, Hiram knew the strange man\r\nhad the basis of a fortune--if he could put it over.\r\n\r\nThis section around Pringleton, as Hiram had learned from Mr. Bronson,\r\nwas not particularly a wheat-growing country. And yet every farmer of\r\nany importance grew some wheat. If this box was full of grain the man\r\nhad about eight bushels, if Hiram was any judge of bulk and measure.\r\nSown carefully, this would be enough for five or six acres. Five or six\r\nacres of wheat is a very small wheat crop, but an excellent seed crop.\r\n\r\nIf Battick really had a new and good wheat, the crop from this amount\r\nof seed would pay him a good penny, if he could sell it to an honest\r\nseedsman. There was thus reason why he should be so afraid of\r\nthieves--and especially of the rats.\r\n\r\nUnder fortunate conditions, the increase of these few bushels of wheat\r\nwould yield Battick a small fortune. Perhaps the man was by no means\r\nas crazy as he at first appeared. And it might be that he knew his\r\nneighbors, and had reason to suspect them of desiring to rob him of the\r\nfruits of his discovery.\r\n\r\nThe two finished supper and pushed back from the table. There was a\r\nsink in one corner of the room, and at this Battick quickly washed the\r\ncooking utensils and tableware, while Hiram dried them. They spoke of\r\ninconsequential things while they did this work Then Battick said:\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have the heart to turn you out on a night like this, even\r\nif it cleared off--which it isn't likely to do. I'll let you sleep in\r\nmy bed and I'll bunk down here before the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Mr. Battick! I could not think of taking your bed,\" Hiram\r\nurged, but with a smile. \"You have proved to me that you are a much\r\nbetter neighbor than you were quoted at; but there is no use in\r\ncarrying the demonstration too far. I will sleep here before the fire\r\nand be very glad of the chance.\"\r\n\r\nYancey Battick flashed him another of those hard, suspicious glances.\r\nIt was not difficult to read the man's mind now that Hiram had\r\ndiscovered, as he thought, the key to the mystery. Battick was\r\nsuspicious of him yet. He said gruffly:\r\n\r\n\"If you remain here to-night, young man, you will sleep in my bed. And\r\nsee that you do sleep, too, for although I snore, I'm easily roused,\r\nand I keep that gun right beside me.\"\r\n\r\nHiram could not help being somewhat exasperated by all this suspicion.\r\nHe was glad enough of the shelter; but he did not think he looked so\r\ndishonest that his host had to guard himself with a shotgun.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Mr. Battick,\" he said, rather tartly. \"You're one of those\r\ncows that give a good pail of milk and then step in it. You give\r\nme supper and a bed, but distrust me. How do you know but you are\r\nentertaining an angel unawares?\" and he ended by laughing a little to\r\ncover his vexation.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, too,\" Battick replied. \"I know all about those\r\n'angels unaware.' I've had my experience with them, and I've had to\r\nrun 'em off the place with my shotgun. Besides, I don't see any wings\r\nsprouting on you, Mr. Strong. I'll treat you just as good as you treat\r\nme. But as I tell 'em all, when you come to my front gate, call out;\r\nand if I don't answer, keep off.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are a pessimist, Mr. Battick,\" Hiram said shortly, \"I hope I'll\r\nnever get to be one.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the man flashed him a more earnest glance than before. His\r\ncountenance became suffused with red.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you never will, young man,\" Battick said. \"And never be an\r\ninventor. Immediately a man starts out to help his fellows, everybody's\r\nhand is turned against him. He is pariah--and likewise the prey of all\r\nthose with thieving instincts. Consider Goodyear, what he suffered; and\r\nElias Howe, and a horde of others.\r\n\r\n\"I came to Pringleton to escape people who wanted to rob me. Some of\r\nthem had. But it seems people are the same in all localities. I have to\r\nwatch, and threaten, and live like an outlaw to keep what is my own,\r\nMr. Strong. You are young and have faith. Keep that faith in people\r\nif you can. But never be an inventor; for that is a crime that should\r\nbe punished by being boiled in oil, or sawn asunder, or drawn and\r\nquartered, or some other middle-age device for making capital criminals\r\nsuffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is dreadful!\" exclaimed Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds pretty rough, I admit,\" Battick said, in his usual tone. \"But\r\nbelieve me, I know whereof I speak. Now, come this way, Mr. Strong. I\r\nthink you will be comfortable.\"\r\n\r\nHe lit a candle at the blaze on the hearth and led the way into his\r\nbedroom. It was a comfortable room, and Battick insisted upon putting\r\nclean sheets on the bed, which he aired before the fire, and left his\r\nguest finally with the word:\r\n\r\n\"Don't be frightened if you hear the gun in the night, Strong. I shall\r\nprobably be only shooting at a rat.\"\r\n\r\nHiram had never been entertained in just this way before. He peered\r\nthrough the crack of the door and saw Yancey Battick loading the barrel\r\nof the shotgun that had previously been emptied. The young fellow went\r\nto bed finally feeling that he was in the midst of alarms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                               SUNNYSIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs so often happens after a hard storm, the weather cleared at daybreak\r\nand a patch of cold blue wintry sky met Hiram Strong's inquisitive gaze\r\nthrough the window as he rolled over in Yancey Battick's comfortable\r\nbed to look out.\r\n\r\nHe judged immediately that it would be a race between Boreas and Jack\r\nFrost as to which would gain the most advantage by the stopping of the\r\nrain. The sturdy wind would try to dry up the saturated earth before\r\nJack Frost could get his fetters on the puddles and plowed ground.\r\n\r\nFrom what he had read of conditions here about Pringleton, the winter\r\nhad already been severe enough for all farming purposes. The grain was\r\nin good shape, the plowed ground had already been well frozen to the\r\ndetriment of the bugs and worms, and the fruit trees were showing no\r\nsigns of early sap-rising.\r\n\r\nAnother month of cold weather, some snow for a wheat-cover, and some\r\nstrong March winds, would put the land in ideal shape for corn.\r\n\r\nAnd Hiram Strong had been brought here to the Corn Belt of the Middle\r\nWest for the express purpose of raising corn.\r\n\r\nHe was enthusiastic over the prospect. He had worked hard and\r\nintelligently on the little Eastern farm, and now had come his chance,\r\nnot only to work out his present theories on a larger scale, but to\r\nexperiment further and with greater facilities for carrying his plans\r\nthrough to successful completion. Yes, it was with eager anticipation\r\nand high hopes that he looked forward to the advancing spring.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephen Bronson had been growing bumper crops on all his farms\r\nthrough the Middle West, and especially those in the vicinity of\r\nPringleton. Without doubt the big farm owner, having seen what Hiram\r\nStrong had accomplished on the Atterson Eighty, determined to learn if\r\nsuch methods of cultivation would pay on a larger acreage and under\r\nsomewhat different conditions of climate and with different tools.\r\n\r\nThe young fellow quite realized that he was on trial only. He must make\r\ngood within two years or he would be a failure in the eyes of such a\r\nsharp business man as Stephen Bronson.\r\n\r\nHiram, however, had no intention of being a failure; he had come here\r\nto Pringleton to win, just as he had gone upon the old Jeptha Atterson\r\nfarm to win.\r\n\r\nHiram remained in bed on this morning until he heard a stir in the\r\nliving room and the sizzling of bacon in the skillet. He had not been\r\ndisturbed by Mr. Battick shooting at rats in the night (for which he\r\nwas grateful), but he had not dared to venture into the outer room\r\nuntil he was sure his host was moving about.\r\n\r\nHiram brought his bag out of the bedroom already packed. Battick only\r\ngrunted a \"good morning,\" and was evidently in no more cheerful mood\r\nthan on the evening before. Had he been invited to do so, the youth\r\nfrom the East would not have wished to prolong his stay with the man.\r\n\r\nBattick, however, seemed still opposed to Hiram's getting into the\r\nclutches of Miss Delia Pringle. At breakfast he said:\r\n\r\n\"If you can stand to 'bach it,' as I do, Mr. Strong, you can make\r\nyourself comfortable up there at Sunnyside, and no thanks to anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you say the house is burned down!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. The last fellow who was on the farm, however, went in\r\nstrong for poultry. Believed in fowls--it was a religion with him. And\r\nI take it a man has got to make 'em his religion really to get anything\r\nout of them. I never had the patience myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe eighty per cent. of those who try hens for profit, fail; but\r\nthe successful ones can easily enough point out the reasons for those\r\nfailures,\" said Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe. However, that Brandenburg who lived at Sunnyside last\r\nfixed up a pretty good hen plant. After the fire he went in a hurry.\r\nFeared he would be blamed, perhaps. And I guess that Pringle woman\r\nwould have done something to him if she could have got the law on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Delia Pringle?\" Hiram asked, with some curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Her folks owned pretty near all the land around here two or three\r\ngenerations ago. That's why it is called Pringleton. Sounds like a\r\nnursery rhyme. She sold Sunnyside to Stephen Bronson, same as she sold\r\nme this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"This was the old Pringle homestead. Built before the Flood, or\r\nthereabout,\" said Battick. \"That is why it is rat-ridden. The rodents\r\nhad it to themselves for years, while the farm lay idle. It had not\r\nbeen cropped to death by tenants; that is why I bought it. You will\r\nfind part of Sunnyside in worse shape than this old place was. Miss\r\nPringle had one tenant after another on the big farm, each one worse\r\nthan the previous incumbent. I hope Stephen Bronson got it cheap\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\n\"You intimated I might find some means of housekeeping up there, after\r\nall,\" said Hiram. \"What did you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"That Brandenburg left his chicken plant just as it was. The end\r\nshed is tight and has a good stove in it and a bunk. He watched his\r\nincubators there. You get some bedclothes and some cooking utensils and\r\nyou'll be fixed right,\" said Battick.\r\n\r\n\"Anything rather than give me up to the teeth and claws of Miss\r\nPringle, is it?\" asked Hiram, with a quiet chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"No laughing matter, young fellow,\" advised Battick, as the visitor\r\nprepared to depart. \"I'll bet you she'll be over to see you before you\r\nare at Sunnyside twenty-four hours--unless she has a broken leg. Oh, I\r\nknow her, Mr. Strong. I pretty near had to run her off this place with\r\nmy gun.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not, Mr. Battick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fact,\" said the man in a perfectly serious way. \"As I tell you, this\r\nwas the old Pringle place. She claimed she liked to come down here for\r\nold time's sake and sit under that buttonwood tree out there. She'd\r\nbring her sewing and stay all the afternoon and I had to dress up and\r\nmake believe I was going to town to get rid of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a good deal of a time-consumer,\" interrupted Hiram, his eyes\r\ndancing with his inward mirth.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" pursued the harassed man, \"folks riding by began to ask me if\r\nwe were going to be married soon and whether I'd continue to live down\r\nhere or go up to Miss Pringle's new house to live with her. It got\r\nright embarrassing for a modest man, for a fact!\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" added Battick, \"I didn't know but she was aiming to get me\r\ninto court for breach of promise. Circumstantial evidence has hung many\r\na man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope I shall have no similar trouble,\" Hiram replied, vastly amused.\r\n\r\nHe believed Battick, in spite of all his moodiness, and his fear of\r\nrats--and dislike for visitors--was a wit and worth cultivating. At\r\nleast, he determined to learn more about that new wheat that the man\r\nwas guarding so religiously.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Hiram had found a chance to pick up a pinch of the wheat corns\r\nfrom under the trough, and had the grain safely twisted up in a bit of\r\npaper in his pocket.\r\n\r\nHe knew better than to offer Mr. Battick anything like money in return\r\nfor the queer hospitality the misanthrope had shown him. Hiram did,\r\nhowever, make one attempt to return something for the kindness.\r\n\r\n\"I see you have seed wheat in this box, Mr. Battick,\" he said. \"If you\r\nwish to keep the rats out of it, I believe I can show you a wrinkle.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can?\" rejoined Battick, watching him with keen suspicion again.\r\n\r\n\"You have a couple of old milk pans there and two wash basins. Invert a\r\nbasin or a pan over each leg of that box and no rat can run up the leg\r\nand over the side of the box, or gnaw into it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I get you!\" ejaculated Battick, seeing the point at once. \"I believe\r\nthat's a good idea, young fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it is,\" rejoined Hiram with confidence. \"I built me a corncrib\r\nthat way only last year. It surely gives Mr. Rat something new to think\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up his bag, shook hands with his odd host, and went out. It\r\nwas a keen wind he faced as he started up the hill to Sunnyside Farm.\r\n\r\nA jay winging its way from one wood to another, stopped upon a dead\r\nlimb to stare curiously at the wayfarer. Then, with raucous cry, it\r\ndisappeared in a piece of woodland that evidently belonged to the old\r\nfarm that Yancey Battick had purchased from the terrible Miss Pringle.\r\nThis windbreak divided the Battick place from Sunnyside.\r\n\r\nWhile he was yet at some distance Hiram saw the burned ruins of the\r\nfarmhouse on the hill and the barns and other outbuildings. All the\r\narable land of Sunnyside seemed to lie on the south side of the road;\r\nand the slope of the fields was toward that same point of the compass.\r\n\r\nThe higher land on his right was heavily timbered clear to the summit\r\nof the hill. As he mounted the incline he obtained a pretty clear idea\r\nof what the acres he expected to farm looked like.\r\n\r\nHiram Strong was deeply interested in his calling. Every young fellow\r\nmust, if he would get on in the world and really amount to anything. As\r\nhe had told Yancey Battick the evening before, Hiram's father had been\r\na good farmer, and he had not only given his son knowledge, but had\r\ninstilled into his mind the principle of thoroughness, as well.\r\n\r\nAs Hiram looked, searching the fields to the far-distant line of the\r\nforest-bounded farm, he wondered what would be his fortune here. Would\r\nhe be able to show a profit for Mr. Bronson on the ledger, as he had\r\nfor Mother Atterson? As to his own contract, Hiram was on a straight\r\nsalary, and whether he made little or much for his employer his own\r\nincome would not be affected.\r\n\r\nBut money was not the only thing that Hiram Strong saw in the bargain.\r\nHe was after a reputation. Moreover, he desired to learn something from\r\nhis experience--whatever it might be--here at Sunnyside.\r\n\r\nHe reached the plain at the top of the rise at last. The outlook all\r\nabout was promising, save in one direction where there was a piece of\r\nburned timber. The nearest house was a white painted cottage with green\r\nblinds on the other side of the road and a few rods beyond the burned\r\ntimber lot.\r\n\r\n\"That must be Miss Pringle's,\" Hiram thought, and on the heels of this\r\nmental decision he beheld to his surprise a woman with a shawl thrown\r\nhastily over her head running out of this small dwelling and out of the\r\nyard, approaching the main gate of the Sunnyside place, evidently in a\r\nstate of exaggerated excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Say, young man!\" she shouted while still some distance away, \"I want\r\nto know why you've kept this whole neighborhood in a stir-up all this\r\nblessed night? Where have you been? And you as dry as a bone right\r\nnow!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                       THE TERRIBLE MISS PRINGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woman so excitedly approaching Sunnyside was a buxom person with\r\nevery sign of an assertive and determined character. This first\r\nspeech addressed to Hiram made him feel that he must somehow be in\r\nthe wrong--that he had done something to shock Miss Pringle and the\r\nneighborhood in general.\r\n\r\nHiram took off his hat as Miss Pringle came near. But he did not offer\r\nhis hand, for he was not at all sure that her greeting was intended to\r\nbe a friendly one.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you are Mr. Strong?\" the woman gasped, rather out of breath\r\nwhen she arrived.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" replied Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for the land's sake, where have you been?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I don't understand you,\" he said. \"Are you Miss Pringle?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's who I am,\" she declared with emphasis. \"And I heard all about\r\nyou from Mr. Bronson. You were comin' to stay at my house last night\r\nand you didn't come. Were you told to come to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly. I was advised to try at your house for lodging--\"\r\n\r\n\"Who by?\" she flashed at him.\r\n\r\n\"By the stationmaster.\"\r\n\r\n\"That dumbhead! I might have known Jase Oakley would ball it all up.\r\nWhen Mr. Bronson 'phoned to me that he could not get over in the storm\r\nto meet you at the depot, I turned right around and 'phoned Jason to\r\ntell you that I would be on the lookout for you. Didn't he tell you\r\nthat, Mr. Strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in just that way,\" replied Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for the land's sake, where did you stop? When you didn't come\r\nalong at the proper time after the train got in last evening I began\r\ncalling folks on the line. I called everybody that had a 'phone, and\r\nnone of 'em had seen you. It was so rough a night--\"\r\n\r\nHiram saw at once that the terrible Miss Pringle was, after all,\r\na kindly soul. It could not be for the mere possession of a \"male\r\ncreature,\" sight unseen, that she had taken all this trouble to locate\r\nhim, a stranger in Pringleton.\r\n\r\n\"You were most kind, Miss Pringle,\" he said quickly. \"I am sorry to\r\nhave caused you any disturbance of mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where did you stay?\" insisted the woman, eyeing Hiram with two\r\nvery sharp brown eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that very little of importance went on in Miss Delia\r\nPringle's neighborhood that she did not see. She was kindly of\r\ndisposition as well as shrewd, Mr. Yancey Battick's opinion to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding. Hiram was not at all afraid of her when he\r\nlooked into her plump and rosy face.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you,\" he said, smiling covertly, for he suspected from what the\r\nstationmaster had said how the majority of the neighbors looked upon\r\nYancey Battick, \"a heavy shower caught me and I made for the nearest\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"And whose was that, for the land's sake?\" was the instant demand.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Battick's,\" Hiram said demurely.\r\n\r\n\"Yancey Battick?\" almost shrieked Miss Pringle. \"Why, he's crazy!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder if he is a little,\" admitted Hiram. \"But I am sure\r\nhe is harmless.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that,\" she demurred. \"He's altogether too quick to\r\nuse a gun. A poor tramp came past here last summer--he never would have\r\nstopped, I guess, only he was out of breath completely--and Battick had\r\nblown his coat-tails off with a charge of rock-salt just because the\r\nhobo had gone into the yard of the old house and around to the well.\r\nThat's the coldest water anywhere in Pringleton; but nobody ever gets a\r\ndrink of it but Yancey Battick now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he's paid for it, Miss Pringle?\" said Hiram quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that he has,\" was her quick reply. \"At least, the\r\nneighbors blame me for selling the old place to such a man. They know\r\nI didn't need the money. And Yancey Battick certainly ain't what you\r\ncan call with truth a good neighbor. We count on getting good neighbors\r\ninto the Pringleton district if we can. That is why I was so glad to\r\nsell Sunnyside to Mr. Bronson.\r\n\r\n\"And do you really mean to tell me that you spent the night with Mr.\r\nBattick?\" she added.\r\n\r\n\"And he did not eat me up,\" laughed Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Well! All I've got to say, young man, is that you're a regular Daniel.\r\nYou'd find it cozy and comfortable, I guess, in a lion's den. Never\r\nheard of anybody's even getting inside of the old house before since\r\nBattick got into it. He _did_ let you inside, didn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't look as though I had stayed out on that leaky old porch of\r\nhis, do I?\" asked Hiram, still much amused.\r\n\r\n\"You're as dry as a bone, as I said before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not only did he entertain me for supper and breakfast, but he gave me\r\nhis own bed in which to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the land's sake!\" Miss Pringle shook her head in wonder. Then her\r\nbrown eyes suddenly snapped. All the inquisitiveness in the woman's\r\nnature came to the surface; perhaps it was her single sin. \"What's he\r\ngot in that house he's so afraid the neighbors might see, Mr. Strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not see anything particularly mysterious--nothing at all,\" Hiram\r\nassured her.\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing? Wasn't he trying to hide anything from you? Didn't he\r\nseem afraid of anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"He certainly has a great fear of rats,\" Hiram admitted, answering\r\nher second query but avoiding the first. \"And he has good reason to.\r\nHe shot a big fellow right there in the house while we sat before the\r\nfire.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say!\"\r\n\r\n\"If it was me I'd get me a weasel and turn him loose in the house and\r\nthen pour cement and broken glass in the rat holes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He knew the rats were there when he bought the old homestead,\"\r\ndeclared Miss Pringle defensively.\r\n\r\n\"And I guess he has a right to shoot them if he wishes to,\" laughed\r\nHiram.\r\n\r\n\"But he is too promiscuous with his shotgun,\" declared the woman,\r\nshaking her head. \"Well, now, Mr. Strong, I'm sorry you did not reach\r\nmy house. I--and Abigail Wentworth who lives with me--would have been\r\nglad to put you up. But I am glad you made out as well as you did at\r\nMr. Battick's. I'm glad to know he's not so bad as we all thought him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the neighbors haven't approached him just right,\" Hiram\r\nsuggested. \"He wishes to be let alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there is something wrong with him,\" Miss Pringle declared.\r\n\"Something that he's ashamed of.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are jumping at a conclusion there, that may not be correct,\" Hiram\r\nsaid. \"At any rate I saw nothing really wrong with Mr. Battick. And I\r\nfeel grateful for his hospitality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, Mr. Strong,\" the woman said quickly, \"you bring your bag\r\nright over to the house and stop with me till Mr. Bronson can make\r\nother arrangements for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are more than kind,\" Hiram told her. \"But I understand that I\r\nmay be able to go to housekeeping on my own account in one of the\r\nsheds--where the former tenant of the farm ran his incubators and\r\nbrooders.\"\r\n\r\n\"That Jim Brandenburg! He made me a lot of trouble. But he did have\r\nideas about hens. I suppose that shed could be made comfortable for you\r\nif Mr. Bronson wants you right on the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try 'baching it,' Miss Pringle,\" Hiram said with firmness.\r\n\r\n\"Well, just as you say. But I want you to come over to-day to dinner.\r\nYou ain't prepared to go right to housekeeping, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you; I will certainly come,\" Hiram assured her.\r\n\r\n\"Do so,\" Miss Pringle said warmly, as she turned away. \"Abigail will\r\nblow the horn when it's ready.\"\r\n\r\nHe thanked her again. The terrible Miss Pringle did not prove to be so\r\nvery formidable after all. It was evident that Battick had gained just\r\nas wrong an idea about his neighbors as the neighbors had about him.\r\n\r\n\"I will keep on the blind side of both parties,\" Hiram Strong told\r\nhimself. \"It is well to have friends in both camps. One thing I surely\r\nwant--that is, to keep on good terms with everybody about Sunnyside.\r\nI don't want to have any such difficulty here as I had with the\r\nDickersons at first, back there at Scoville,\" he added, remembering\r\nvery poignantly a neighborhood feud that had hampered him when he first\r\nwent to work on the Atterson Eighty.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Pringle had gone back to her neat little cottage across\r\nthe road, Hiram began examining the buildings left standing on the\r\nSunnyside premises. Nothing of importance but the dwelling itself had\r\nbeen destroyed by the fire.\r\n\r\nThe barn had a basement with swinging stanchions for ten cows and\r\nstalls for several horses. The mows were filled with a good quality of\r\nhay, and some oats in the straw--a feed that Hiram did not much approve\r\nof. For a horse or mule has to be very hungry indeed to eat oat-straw,\r\nand fed in this way a large proportion of the grain is wasted and\r\ntrampled underfoot with the roughage.\r\n\r\n\"It looks to me,\" Hiram decided, after coming out of the barn, \"that\r\nsomebody tried to run a small dairy here without a silo. There are\r\nstacks of corn fodder, half of it winter-spoiled, and not a beast on\r\nthe place to eat it up. It would pay Mr. Bronson to buy some young\r\nstock right now and turn it into the paddock back of the barn, and feed\r\nup all this roughage.\r\n\r\n\"Even if there is little pasture on the farm, it would pay to do this,\r\nand if the stock is not fattened by May, hire pasture for them on\r\nneighboring farms. I hate to see fodder go to waste, for it is the most\r\nexpensive feed a farmer can raise.\"\r\n\r\nMany an older farmer would have called in question the young fellow's\r\nstatement. But Hiram was thinking no longer as a \"one-horse farmer.\" He\r\nhad got out of that class now. Here at Sunnyside, if he made a profit\r\nat all, it must be through much bigger agricultural activities than he\r\nhad ever been able to compass before.\r\n\r\nHe went on to the row of poultry houses and entered the first one. This\r\nwas the incubator house of which Mr. Battick had told him. It was a\r\nwell-built and comfortable place. There was a good-sized pot stove and\r\na bunk to sleep in. There was a cupboard, too, and a table and a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Guess I can make out here for a while, at any rate,\" he thought as he\r\ncame out-of-doors again. \"Of course, later I shan't have time to get\r\nmy own meals; but at first--Ah! here comes an automobile. I wonder if\r\nthis is not Mr. Bronson now?\" and he started for the gate to meet the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                         FARMING AND FURBELOWS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motor-car that came swiftly along the ridge road to the gate of\r\nSunnyside Farm was a big, seven-passenger touring car. Behind the wheel\r\nsat a big man in a fur coat. To tell the truth, however, it was not Mr.\r\nBronson, his employer, at whom Hiram Strong first looked.\r\n\r\nHe had caught sight of a veil trailing upon the wind from the tonneau.\r\nA girl sat there--a very winsome looking, bright-faced girl--and before\r\nthe car stopped she had spied Hiram and waved a gloved hand at him,\r\nshouting:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hiram Strong! isn't this a beautiful spot? How are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right, Miss Lettie,\" he said answering the second question\r\nfirst. \"I guess it is pretty here at Sunnyside in summer. But look at\r\nthose wheels and mudguards!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson began to chuckle, shutting off his engine.\r\n\r\n\"Hiram's right, Lettie,\" he said to his daughter. \"You'd better stay in\r\nthe car and keep out of this mud. What do you think of the drainage\r\nhereabout, Hi?\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped out of the car himself and shook hands with Hiram, man to\r\nman. It was evident by his manner and look that Mr. Stephen Bronson\r\nboth liked and respected Hiram Strong.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't had much time to look about, Mr. Bronson,\" replied the\r\nyouth, \"only got here an hour ago. But it does look as though that\r\nfield yonder\"--and he pointed to one at the east of the house lot that\r\nwas covered with shallow puddles--\"would be the better for some tiling.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet it is high and should be dry.\"\r\n\r\n\"All high land isn't dry--that piece proves it. What's in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thought so. It won't be much of a crop, I fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much tiling would it need to drain that whole piece properly, do\r\nyou think? I understand from the farmers about here that that twenty\r\nacres has never made heavy crops--neither of corn nor grain. It has\r\nbeen limed well, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"The litmus paper test will prove or disprove that,\" said Hiram. \"But\r\nit is high, almost level land, and right along the roadside. It ought\r\nto grow you a good crop to advertise the farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume that's so, Hiram,\" laughed Mr. Bronson. \"But a carload of\r\ntiles, and dragged clear up here from the siding at Pringleton, would\r\ncost a heap of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed the young farmer. \"Perhaps you had better make the better\r\nfields pay in advance for the improvements on the poor ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, wait!\" cried Lettie Bronson, with a pout. \"You men have begun\r\ntalking farming like a house afire--right at the start! I can't get\r\na word in edgewise, and I've got news for Hiram. You know, Hiram, I\r\nonly came on from St. Beris yesterday, just to remain at Plympton with\r\nfather over Sunday.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I only got here last night, Miss Lettie,\" the young fellow said.\r\n\r\n\"Then we might have traveled together just as well as not!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"I guess not,\" laughed her father. \"You went to see that machinery we\r\ntalked about, didn't you, Hi?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I went all through the Comet Plow Factory and the big\r\nagricultural warehouse in Cincinnati.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Lettie, he was several days coming here from Scoville.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" Miss Lettie declared, \"I want to tell him something he\r\ndoesn't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are a whole lot of things I guess you could tell me that I don't\r\nknow, Miss Lettie,\" said Hiram rather ruefully, for he felt his lack\r\nof book knowledge most keenly.\r\n\r\n\"It is about Sister. Cecilia, I suppose her real name is, Hiram?\"\r\n\r\n\"But rather stiff and formal for Sister,\" said the young fellow,\r\ndodging the query.\r\n\r\n\"I chanced to ride past the Atterson place,\" pursued Lettie Bronson,\r\n\"and Mrs. Atterson was on the porch and waved to me. I rode into the\r\nyard, and she was full of the news. It seems that Sister has not known\r\njust who her people were.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was an orphan when Mother Atterson got her,\" admitted Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it seems that she really has some relatives, somewhere. And\r\nMrs. Atterson says she thinks there will be some money coming to\r\nSister--Cecilia. She had just received a letter from a lawyer who had\r\nbeen trying to find Cecilia for some time. It's quite a romance, isn't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am awfully glad for Sister's sake,\" the young farmer said. \"But if\r\nshe finds her folks I hope they will not take her away from Mother\r\nAtterson. She needs Sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not see Cecilia to speak to,\" Lettie said. Then to her father:\r\n\"Now, Papa Bronson, I know you and Hiram want to tramp all over this\r\nfarm, and you certainly shall not leave me here in the car to catch my\r\ndeath of cold. Let Hiram take me over to Miss Pringle's. She will give\r\nme shelter till you are ready to go home again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead and take the chatterbox over there, Hiram,\" said Mr. Bronson.\r\n\"We'll have no peace until you do.\"\r\n\r\nIt could not be said honestly that Hiram Strong found Lettie a\r\nnuisance, if her father did. He would have enjoyed talking to the\r\npretty girl at any length. When Lettie hopped out of the automobile,\r\ntoo, resting one hand lightly in his, the young farmer saw that she\r\nwas, as always, very becomingly dressed. Perhaps her outfit was more\r\nexpensive and somewhat too \"grown-up\" for a girl of her age; but\r\nHiram--nor Mr. Bronson--did not realize that defect in the motherless\r\ngirl's garments. That Lettie was growing up too fast for her own good,\r\nperhaps, would not appeal to the masculine mind as it would to a\r\nthoughtful woman.\r\n\r\nHaving been reminded of Sister, Hiram took mental note that the\r\ngirl whom he had first known as the boarding house slavey in Mother\r\nAtterson's kitchen had never in her life dressed anything like Lettie\r\nBronson. Fine feathers do not always make fine birds; but the feathers\r\nhelp!\r\n\r\nLettie chattered as Hiram helped her over the muddy spots in the road\r\nto the cottage where Miss Pringle lived. The woman welcomed Lettie\r\nvociferously. To Hiram she said, with a smirk:\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't forget, Mr. Strong, to come over to dinner when Abigail\r\nblows the horn.\"\r\n\r\nHiram saw Lettie's dancing eyes and he could not keep from blushing\r\nwhen Miss Pringle was so urgent and significant in both look and speech.\r\n\r\n\"I guess Yancey Battick isn't so far out of the way, after all,\" the\r\nyoung fellow muttered as he went to rejoin Mr. Bronson. \"Miss Pringle\r\ndoes rather work on a modest fellow. Lettie Bronson's got the laugh on\r\nme, all right.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson had been going through the poultry houses and Hiram caught\r\nhim at the house in which he thought to set up housekeeping.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that is a good idea, Hiram,\" said the gentleman thoughtfully.\r\n\"I haven't told you what I intend to do here, have I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that you intend to farm it,\" the boy replied with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"You are to do that, my boy, for me,\" rejoined Mr. Bronson. \"I expect\r\nyou to bring this farm into such a state of fertility in a few years\r\nthat I can sell it at a big profit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds like a big contract, Mr. Bronson,\" said Hiram, shaking his\r\nhead thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"You're equal to it, my boy!\" declared Bronson, confidently. \"Now, is\r\nthis the hut you think you can camp in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can make myself comfortable here for a while--until the spring work\r\nreally opens, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. That suits me. We'll run down to the store at the Forks\r\nbefore I go back to Plympton and buy provisions, bedding and cooking\r\nutensils for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No need to go to any great expense,\" put in Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"The things I buy will all come in handy later. And that brings me\r\naround to what I started to say before, Hiram. It does not pay me to\r\nfarm this place so far from my headquarters. My other farms are right\r\naround Plympton. I can move my tractor and my reapers and my thrashing\r\nmachine and hay-balers from farm to farm in my Plympton string of\r\nplaces. But Sunnyside is too far away from headquarters to send over\r\nmany of the machines, unless it is the thrasher. That is why I had you\r\nlook at the farm machinery on your way out here.\"\r\n\r\nHiram merely nodded.\r\n\r\n\"My idea,\" pursued the man, \"is to put Sunnyside Farm in good shape\r\nand then sell it at a profit to some man who wants a 'gentleman's\r\nfarm'--you know, catch one of these city men who wants to retire to the\r\ncountry; the kind the farmers say have more money than brains.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" chuckled Hiram, remembering what Battick had said about Mr.\r\nStephen Bronson himself. \"Sometimes those gentlemen farmers show the\r\nold timers a thing or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They can afford to experiment and try out new things. However,\r\nthat is not just what we were getting at. If I sell this farm for a\r\ngood price I must have a good house on it. I mean to build on the site\r\nof the old house that was burned. I shall have to bring workmen here\r\nand lodge and feed them. As there are no neighbors who make a practice\r\nof taking boarders, other than their own farm help, I shall have to put\r\nup a shack, hire a cook, and feed the gang for three months at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Hiram. \"And I can get my meals with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That is my idea. So if you can get along alone for a while--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I can, Mr. Bronson.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will have a shack built and a kitchen and bunks established just\r\nas soon as the weather is warm enough. Meanwhile my trucks, when not\r\notherwise in use, can be hauling the frame and lumber for the new\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"One word, Mr. Bronson,\" said Hiram Strong quickly. \"As long as you\r\nmust build a shed, why not build one that will afterward house these\r\nnew tools you propose to buy for my use? I see there is no storage room\r\nfor such things save on the barn floor, and in time they will be in the\r\nway there.\"\r\n\r\nA gleam of approval flashed into Mr. Bronson's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Good idea, Hiram! And you are as full of good ideas as an egg is\r\nof meat,\" said Mr. Bronson with enthusiasm. \"Have you thought of\r\nany particular way in which this farm should be run--for the biggest\r\nprofit, I mean?\" and the man smiled at Hiram curiously.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what struck me right off the reel, Mr. Bronson,\" said\r\nthe youth thoughtfully. \"But it is only a thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's have it,\" urged Mr. Bronson.\r\n\r\n\"This land has been worked by tenants only for some years. Tenant\r\nfarmers usually supply commercial fertilizer to some extent, but not\r\nenough humus. The land needs humus--and that in the form of stable\r\nmanure. Especially the manure from cattle--from cows--if you want to\r\nraise bumper crops of corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume that is so, Hiram.\"\r\n\r\n\"The barn yonder is arranged for the keeping of cattle. You should at\r\nleast drive some young stock up here right away to eat up the roughage\r\nthat is going to waste. We want to make all the fertilizer possible and\r\nspread it on the land as fast as it can be made and carted out of the\r\nbarn basement.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can't handle milch cows here, Hiram, before we have a house in\r\nwhich to put a family to look after the cows and the milk.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is why I say buy some young stock for the present. I can attend\r\nto them myself. They can be fattening at practically no expense. And\r\nall the time they will be making fertilizer for the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Hiram, what is going to happen,\" asked Mr. Bronson, quizzically,\r\n\"when we give up farming with horses and mules entirely and use only\r\ntractors?\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred tractors won't put back into the soil the fertility that one\r\nhorse will,\" the young farmer said. \"That is sure. Soiling crops are\r\nall right. But in the end, the only farms run by tractor power that\r\nare not going to be injured beyond repair are the dairy farms. And I\r\nbelieve the easiest and quickest way to get this half run-down farm\r\ninto shape is by putting cattle on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Young stock--yes. I agree with you that can be done at once. In fact,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Bronson, \"I should not be surprised if I could pick up a score\r\nof head of stock to send up here within the week from my other farms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! That will be a beginning. But two score will be better. Pasture\r\nthem later if the pasture is any good here.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is good pasture and the fences are in good condition. I looked\r\nthem over before I bought the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, sir. You agree with me, then, that we should aim in the end\r\nto make Sunnyside a dairy farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems to be the idea, Hiram. I fancy you are right.\"\r\n\r\n\"That being the case, Mr. Bronson, there is one thing you must do.\r\nThere is only one really profitable way to feed dairy cattle. That is\r\nfrom the silo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Oh! Hiram, you hurt!\" exclaimed his employer, and his smile was\r\nvery rueful. \"Do you realize that any kind of silo runs into money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. But it will cost you less to put up a silo now, while you\r\nhave workmen on the place building your house, than at a later time. If\r\nyou are going to make Sunnyside fertile, you must have cattle; if you\r\nare going to feed cattle cheaply you must cut your corn green and shred\r\nit and blow it into the silo. It is the safest and the cheapest way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I have got to admit all you say as true. But your\r\nsuggestions, are all expensive. The first outlay will be enormous. Here\r\nyou want to tile that twenty acres of upland. And goodness knows what\r\nyou may want to do with some of the lowland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make it grow good crops--bumper crops if possible--that is all,\" said\r\nHiram smiling. \"And about that twenty acres along the county road that\r\nis now in wheat--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've an idea about underdraining that! but I won't tell you what it is\r\nuntil I have looked over the ground a little. I am convinced that that\r\nparticular piece should be as fertile as any acreage around here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It never has been, they tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is no reason why we shouldn't make it the best, is it?\" and the\r\nyoung farmer laughed again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                             SEED TESTING\r\n\r\n\r\nBy evening of his first day on Sunnyside Farm Hiram Strong was\r\ncomfortably established in the incubator shed and prepared to keep\r\nhouse after a fashion. Mr. Bronson supplied him with the requisites for\r\na home on the limited plan Hiram intended to follow. The young farmer\r\nbelieved, however, that Miss Delia Pringle really would have taken him\r\nto board had he not been so firm in his stand for independence.\r\n\r\nIt could not be denied that Miss Pringle was a very friendly neighbor;\r\nbut Hiram saw that Yancey Battick had some right on his side when he\r\nstated that he was afraid of the spinster. During those first few days\r\nthat Hiram was at Sunnyside he, too, thought it the part of wisdom to\r\ndodge her as much as possible.\r\n\r\nNot that there was any harm in Miss Pringle. She was merely silly, or\r\nseemed to be, about men; but Lettie Bronson had teased Hiram all the\r\nway to the store in the automobile and back again that first day about\r\nthe conquest the youth had made of his nearest neighbor at Sunnyside.\r\n\r\nThis had made Hiram self-conscious and had served to exaggerate in his\r\nmind Miss Pringle's already too pronounced attentions.\r\n\r\n\"You will not be lonely at all, Mr. Strong,\" the rougish girl told him,\r\nimmensely pleased by the situation. \"Delia Pringle is going to make\r\nlife there at Sunnyside for you one grand sweet song! You see if she\r\ndoesn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope she will not insist upon being too kind to me,\" sighed Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"She told me that she thinks you are very manly for your age,\" giggled\r\nLettie, who enjoyed making the youth feel uncomfortable. \"And I am sure\r\nshe thinks your age is just right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, Lettie!\" advised her father. \"I've heard you praise Hiram\r\nyourself on occasion. At least, I never heard you run him down much\r\nwhen talking about him.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement closed the girl's lips immediately and gave Hiram peace.\r\nBut he did not wish Lettie to think for a moment that he considered\r\nMiss Pringle's interest in him really earnest. However, during his\r\nfirst week or ten days at Sunnyside Farm Hiram Strong was about as busy\r\nas one could be; so he did not have to invent many excuses to escape\r\nMiss Pringle's rather pressing attentions.\r\n\r\nFarming is an exacting occupation. One cannot let loose ends lie and\r\nbe successful. Before the actual plowing and planting begins there are\r\ninnumerable details to be gone into and many matters to be settled, for\r\nwhen the spring work once opens there is time for nothing else. And\r\nto Hiram, this first year of his work in this strange section of the\r\ncountry, came more than the ordinary number of affairs to be looked\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson sent him over a dependable road horse and a run-about, so\r\nthat he could get about the neighborhood on such errands as he might\r\nfind necessary. And one of his first errands was to hunt up the best\r\ncorn growers in that section and buy seed corn of them.\r\n\r\nHe believed, as he had shown in farming the Atterson Eighty, that\r\nraising such corn as was already being grown in the locality was the\r\nwiser course. Corn becomes acclimated, and men who have raised the crop\r\nyear after year in one neighborhood must know more about the proper\r\nseed to use than a stranger.\r\n\r\nMethods of raising the crop was another matter. Hiram had certain\r\nmethods he wished to try out to improve and increase the yield of\r\ncorn that had nothing to do with locality, climate, or soil. These\r\nexperiments he would try in any case.\r\n\r\nHe found one man whose cribs were full of a small-cobbed corn of a\r\nyellow dent variety, but with many red kernels interspersed among the\r\nyellow on most ears. It might not have been what the judges at a corn\r\nshow would have called true to type, nor was it a handsome corn. But\r\nit was as hard as a rock, well rooted on the cob, and, furthermore, it\r\nground into the finest kind of meal.\r\n\r\n\"How do you select your seed for this, Mr. Brown?\" Hiram asked the\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\n\"I just throw aside what look to me like good ears as the boys bring\r\nthe corn up from the fields and I count the baskets. I don't try to\r\nselect ears in the field as I hear they do on the agricultural college\r\nfarm. That's all flapdoodle,\" said the old fellow, with evident\r\nconfidence in his own opinion.\r\n\r\n\"When I'm ready to get my seed, Mr. Strong, just before planting time,\r\nI go over the ears I've saved, and what the rats have left me--\"\r\n\r\n\"So you are a friend of the rats, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"What d'you mean--a friend of the rats? I feel about as friendly to\r\nthem as I do to potato bugs or polecats. Not any!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you feed them--and, what's worse, on your seed corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like to see you keep rats out of anything that you have to keep corn\r\nin,\" said Daniel Brown energetically. \"Not any!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll take that up at some future time,\" Hiram said seriously. \"I\r\ndon't believe in letting rats or mice have the run of my seed corn. I\r\nthink too much of it. Besides, they often nibble the germ of the corn\r\nand that particular grain never comes up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I count on the planter dropping enough in the hill to overcome\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then you have to go tediously over the field and pull up the\r\nsuperfluous sprouts, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who don't?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate to,\" confessed Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Lots of things about farming, young man, that we hate to do. And\r\nyou'll find it out as you get older.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't doubt it. I'm learning things--both good and bad--every day.\r\nDon't you test your corn, Mr. Brown?\"\r\n\r\n\"What d'you mean? In the silly little boxes they tell about at the\r\nagriculturoolarulal college?\" chuckled the old hard-shell farmer. \"Not\r\nany! And I raise the very best corn in this section.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you believe in scientific farming?\"\r\n\r\n\"Science is all right for city folks that need it when they come\r\nout on to the land and mess around, raising crops,\" declared the old\r\nman in good natured disgust. \"But experience counts for more than\r\nbook-learning, and don't you forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But just think what you might do, Mr. Brown, with all your experience\r\nand just a little science.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rats!\" chuckled the old man.\r\n\r\n\"That is much to the point,\" Hiram said gravely. \"'Rats.' A little\r\nscience properly applied would free your cribs of rats. I am going to\r\nsend you a Government pamphlet on that matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I usually roll them into pipe-spills, young man,\" replied Brown. \"I\r\nain't never cultivated a taste for fiction.\"\r\n\r\nBut from the looks of the farms, the outbuildings, and the well rolled\r\nfields and machine sheds he passed in driving through the country,\r\nHiram did not believe that there were many farmers in the vicinity as\r\nstubborn as Mr. Brown. However, he had obtained two baskets of Mr.\r\nBrown's seed corn, paying two dollars for it, and he was sure he had\r\nthe foundation for a good crop.\r\n\r\nHe did not intend to plant the corn haphazard, as Brown himself did. He\r\nstopped at the store just beyond the Pringleton station and bought some\r\nyards of canton flannel.\r\n\r\nHiram drove back to Sunnyside Farm. Just as he reached the gate the\r\nrural delivery mail wagon stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the new man on Sunnyside Farm?\" the postman asked Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your name's Strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hiram Strong,\" he admitted, going closer to the wagon.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, then.\"\r\n\r\nThe postman thrust out a letter and Hiram accepted it. Instantly he\r\nknew it was from home--for Scoville was still \"home\" to Hiram Strong.\r\nThe letter was from Mother Atterson, and as soon as the postman had\r\ngone his way Hiram tore open the envelope and read its contents:\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Hiram:\r\n\r\n    \"We got your letter that you had arrived at that Sunnyside place\r\n    and was sleeping in the henhouse and cooking your own meals.\r\n    That is pretty hard going, I do allow; but Mr. Bronson is paying\r\n    you big wages (I wish I could afford to pay you as well and had\r\n    kept you here on the Atterson place) so you can put up with some\r\n    inconvenience. For money is a good thing and that brings me to the\r\n    great news about Sister. That child certainly has got money coming\r\n    to her. We have heard from a lawyer that says her grandmother,\r\n    who must have been a pretty harsh old lady, on her father's side,\r\n    named Cheltenham, has died and left a lot of money to be divided\r\n    between Sister and--What do you know about Sister having a brother?\r\n    Ain't it surprising? But it seems the children were parted when\r\n    they was small, one going one way and the other the other, and the\r\n    boy has to be found according to the terms of Mrs. Cheltenham's\r\n    will before the money can be divided. It is going to cost something\r\n    to find the boy who ran away from a reform school and ain't been\r\n    heard of since. And that's got to be paid out of the money the\r\n    lawyer says. But he seems like an honest man and Mr. Strickland\r\n    says he knows him. And I am glad for Sister's sake for now she's\r\n    got folks and knows who they are.\"\r\n\r\nMother Atterson's letter continued in this strain and to great length.\r\nBut Hiram was very glad to hear the particulars of Sister's good\r\nfortune. For there would always be in Hiram Strong's heart a very\r\ntender place devoted to Sister. The little slavey of the boarding house\r\nwas developing now into an intelligent and attractive girl.\r\n\r\nOf course, Hiram told himself, she would never be like Lettie Bronson\r\nor the other girls who attended St. Beris, for instance. But there\r\nwas something very sweet about Sister's character that Hiram felt and\r\nliked. She was almost like a real sister, and more.\r\n\r\nHiram went on to his living quarters and made his seed testing boxes,\r\nusing the canton flannel instead of earth in which to germinate the\r\ncorn selected from the ears he had bought of Daniel Brown. He made his\r\nboxes two inches deep and about thirteen inches wide, allowing for the\r\nwidth of the flannel, which was twenty-seven inches, folded once and\r\ntaking into consideration the slight shrinkage of the cloth.\r\n\r\nHiram considered the flannel better in the seed boxes than either sand,\r\nsoil, or sawdust. Three or four thicknesses of cloth in the bottom of\r\nthe box and two thicknesses over the seed, all well dampened, makes the\r\nideal seed testing bed.\r\n\r\nHe washed the new cloth thoroughly and after it was dried and folded\r\nin the box as a bed, he marked it off into checkers of two inches each\r\nwith an indelible pencil. He then soaked the cloth and replaced it in\r\nthe box.\r\n\r\nShelling off and discarding the small and irregular grains from the\r\ntips and butts of the ears he intended to test, he selected the kernels\r\nto be germinated and placed those from ear number one in the first\r\nsquare on the canton flannel, germ side up, from ear number two in the\r\nsecond square, and so on. Wetting the other strip of flannel he covered\r\nthe corn, and on top of the box laid a pane of glass that fitted\r\ntightly.\r\n\r\nThis method of testing seed enables one to examine the seed at any time\r\nwithout injury to it; the amount of water condensed upon the under\r\nside of the glass will usually show whether the cloths are drying out\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nThe numbered ears Hiram stacked upon a hanging shelf in one of the\r\nlaying houses, confident that neither rats nor mice would reach the\r\nseed corn in that place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                             THE BLUEBIRD\r\n\r\n\r\nLettie Bronson did not come to Sunnyside again that spring, but her\r\nfather, of course, came frequently during the first weeks of Hiram's\r\nincumbency as superintendent of the hillside farm.\r\n\r\nIt had been finally agreed that the shed to be built to house the\r\ngang of workmen should be a permanent shelter for certain new farm\r\nimplements that Hiram and his employer had decided upon. And, in\r\naddition, a silo was to be built.\r\n\r\n\"But go easy on the first cost, Hiram,\" Mr. Bronson continued. \"This\r\nfarm is for sale. An expensive silo will not help sell it any quicker\r\nthan an old-fashioned silo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that. It is altogether according to the man who\r\nbuys. But I am not opposed to the old-fashioned stave silo, only it\r\nsoon rots out.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will stand five years.\"\r\n\r\n\"And maybe for twenty,\" agreed Hiram quickly. \"Just according.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about these new all metal ones?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have not been tried out long enough for the reports of their\r\nusefulness to be verified.\"\r\n\r\n\"My gang of carpenters can put up the stave silo,\" Mr. Bronson said.\r\n\r\n\"All right, sir. But buy iron hoops for supports, Mr. Bronson, and use\r\nwire stays or one of these big winds they tell about around here will\r\nblow your silo over--especially before it is filled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, we'll do that, of course.\"\r\n\r\nThe lumber began to arrive, truck load after truck load. The first\r\ndrivers to arrive at Sunnyside were very curious about the identity of\r\nthe boy from the East.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the boss, son?\" Hiram was asked again and again as he met\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you will have to get along with me as boss,\" he was wont to\r\nsay quietly.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it! Bronson hasn't hired you to run this farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I'm going to try to run it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I always did say that Bronson was crazy,\" was one frank\r\nstatement. \"More money than brains--more money than brains! Ridiculous\r\nto give a boy like you such a job!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is to be seen,\" Hiram said coolly. \"It does not always take frost\r\non the hair to ripen brains.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the man grinned and replied:\r\n\r\n\"You've got a tongue, at any rate, young fellow.\"\r\n\r\nOne incident did not pass off so pleasantly. A hulking young fellow\r\nturned in at the gateway of Sunnyside and hailed Hiram:\r\n\r\n\"Where's your dad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately he has been dead for some years,\" Hiram told him. \"Won't\r\nI do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh! Where's Mr. Bronson?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll find him at his home in Plympton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, when's he here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not say for sure when he is to be here. Hadn't you better tell\r\nme your business?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear he wants to hire men for work here; but I want to do my\r\nbusiness with the boss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you can talk with me, for anybody who works on this farm will\r\nhave to look upon me as the boss,\" Hiram told him, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"You ain't got charge of this farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Mr. Bronson has hired me in that capacity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be switched!\"\r\n\r\n\"I want some men to ditch and for other heavy work for a few weeks,\"\r\nHiram said calmly. \"After that I shall need plowmen at better pay. You\r\nare a farmer, I presume?\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume I am,\" said the fellow scornfully. \"But I don't want to hire\r\nout to any kid. I want a man for a boss.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I would not suit you then,\" sighed Hiram, with perfect\r\ngravity. \"Come around in a couple of years, when I am older, and\r\nperhaps we can make a dicker.\"\r\n\r\nThe fellow went away muttering. Later Hiram chanced to pass the Pringle\r\ncottage and the owner came to the gate to hail him.\r\n\r\n\"Did Adam Banks come to see you, Mr. Strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"The big fellow with the mop of yellow hair? Yes, Miss Pringle; he said\r\nhe was looking for a job. But I doubt if he loses his eyesight looking\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said something,\" declared Miss Pringle. \"And he just said to me he\r\nwouldn't be caught working at Sunnyside if you were going to run the\r\nfarm.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said he should think Mr. Bronson could find enough men in the\r\nneighborhood to do his work without sending off for a--a----\"\r\n\r\n\"For a boy?\" laughed Hiram. \"If I can't make good in my job there will\r\nsoon be a chance for somebody else to take my place.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the land's sake! I do hope you will stop here, Mr. Strong. I\r\nshouldn't want to see Mr. Bronson put a fellow like Ad Banks in charge\r\nat Sunnyside. He'd be worse than that Jim Brandenburg that made me so\r\nmuch trouble--burning everything all up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope your house that was burned was insured, Miss Pringle,\" Hiram\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, 'twas, Mr. Strong. But that piece of pine timber across the road\r\nwasn't. The sparks flew from the house and caught that, and you can see\r\nquite a patch of it was burned--completely ruined for any purpose, even\r\nfirewood. Who wants to handle wood that smuts you all up? I had a log\r\nor two dragged up to the house and sawed and split; but Abigail can't\r\nabide it. Says she won't have it in her kitchen. And I can't blame her.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you have no use for that burned timber?\" asked Hiram thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"No more'n a cat has for two tails.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you just going to let it stand there and be blown down by the\r\nwind?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've told some folks that haven't much firewood that they can have it\r\nfor the cutting and hauling.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that Mr. Bronson would be willing to have me make just\r\nthat kind of a bargain,\" said Hiram smiling. \"But I can make use of\r\nsome of those dead trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can? Remember they are fire-killed, Mr. Strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you ten cents apiece for them, and I will have them cut and\r\nhauled, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the land's sake!\" ejaculated Miss Pringle, her bargaining\r\ninstincts coming immediately to the fore, \"I think that is an awful\r\nsmall price.\"\r\n\r\nThe young fellow laughed. \"That is just ten cents apiece more than you\r\nhad any expectation of getting for the burned trees, Miss Pringle.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may very well be,\" she argued. \"But this is a bargain now. Money\r\nis money. If you think the trees are worth ten cents apiece to you,\r\nlike enough they are worth a quarter each. I don't like to feel I've\r\ndone myself in any deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you will own the timber a long while at that price.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the land's sake, you can raise me a little, can't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how I can,\" replied Hiram gravely.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard that you Down East Yankees are as sharp at bargaining as\r\ncan be. It does seem as though I ought to get fifteen cents apiece.\"\r\n\r\n\"The longer those blackened trees stand on your land, the longer the\r\nland will be worth just nothing to you, Miss Pringle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Land isn't worth much to a lone woman like me, Mr. Strong,\" she\r\nsimpered. \"Unless a body's got a man--\"\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Pringle got on this tack Hiram always felt embarrassed. He\r\nstarted to break off negotiations at once.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, never mind. It was just an idea I had. Nothing much in it, I\r\nguess.\"\r\n\r\nHe started on, but she got hold of his sleeve and held him tightly.\r\nHiram blushed, and he was sorry he had spoken about the timber. At any\r\nrate he was very glad that Lettie Bronson did not see him now!\r\n\r\n\"For the land's sake!\" cried Miss Pringle, \"you're so sudden, Mr.\r\nStrong. Won't you split the difference and give me twelve and a half\r\ncents?\"\r\n\r\nA bargain was a bargain, and it was up to Hiram to do the best he could\r\nfor his employer. Besides, the use of the half-charred tree trunks was\r\nat best an experiment.\r\n\r\n\"Ten cents is my best offer, Miss Pringle. I can use a hundred of the\r\nburned trees; maybe two hundred.\"\r\n\r\n\"And only the charred ones, Mr. Strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can keep tally on them,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"All right. Seeing it is you, Mr. Strong,\" she concluded, her head on\r\none side and looking languishingly at him. \"We're such friends, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nHiram groaned inwardly. But he went in with her then and there and\r\nwrote out the agreement in duplicate, both signing the papers.\r\n\r\n\"Seems like a lot of folderol for ten or twenty dollars, Hiram,\" Miss\r\nPringle whispered. \"But, of course, I understand you have to have\r\neverything in writing to show Mr. Bronson. Mr. Bronson is a widower,\r\nand they do say widowers are awful strict and stern.\"\r\n\r\nBut Hiram did not immediately tell Mr. Bronson of the bargain he had\r\nmade with Miss Pringle for the half-charred timber. However, he planned\r\nto start certain activities at Sunnyside the very next day, and he\r\ndrove down to Pringleton to see if Mr. Oakley, the stationmaster, knew\r\nof any laborers in the neighborhood who wished work.\r\n\r\nComing back, he saw Mr. Yancey Battick leaning upon his sagging front\r\ngate. He had not seen the odd man to more than hail him since the time\r\nhe had sojourned with him over night.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like spring now, doesn't it, Mr. Battick?\" Hiram suggested,\r\nstopping his horse.\r\n\r\n\"I guess. And there's the first harbinger--a bluebird,\" and Battick\r\npointed up the road.\r\n\r\n\"What's that? Bluebird?\" Then Hiram laughed, seeing the individual to\r\nwhom Battick referred. \"The first tramp of the season?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And full as a tick, if I'm any judge,\" Battick said, with disgust.\r\n\r\nThe fellow up ahead was staggering as he walked, and there was reason\r\nfor thinking that he was intoxicated.\r\n\r\n\"He won't get far in that shape,\" Hiram said.\r\n\r\n\"He'll get far enough, perhaps,\" muttered Battick, turning away. \"Look\r\nout he doesn't get into your barn, Mr. Strong, and set the mow on fire.\"\r\n\r\nThe two chatted a few moments longer about the weather and neighborhood\r\naffairs, and then Hiram started his horse and drove on toward Sunnyside\r\nFarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                              ORRIN POST\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the fifth day since Hiram had started his test boxes, and he\r\nwas so much interested in this matter on his arrival at Sunnyside that\r\nhe did not think again of Mr. Battick's first \"bluebird,\" or harbinger\r\nof spring. In fact, he had not seen the fellow along the road and\r\npresumed the tramp had crept into a thicket somewhere to sleep off his\r\nintoxication.\r\n\r\nHe bedded down Jerry, the horse, and fed him, for it was early\r\ntwilight. He locked the barn and went up to the incubator shed where\r\nhe lodged. He always kept a fire here, and the temperature of the seed\r\nboxes had never fallen below 65°, and he usually managed to keep the\r\nheat at about 70°. He knew that a drop below 55° would seriously affect\r\nthe germination of the corn, and at night Hiram wrapped bags about the\r\nboxes and covered them well.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which he had made his tests of Mr. Brown's corn\r\nhad been ideal. When he uncovered the boxes he saw at once that all\r\nthe ears he had selected kernels from were not strong and vigorous. Any\r\nkernel of corn that does not send out vigorous sprouts of both root and\r\nstem within four or five days is too weak to germinate properly under\r\nordinary field conditions.\r\n\r\nHiram discarded promptly all of twenty ears in this lot--feeding some\r\nof the discarded ones to Jerry the next morning for his breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"They look all right,\" Hiram observed to himself. \"But looks are\r\nsometimes deceiving. I have an idea that Mr. Brown plants a whole lot\r\nof seed that either does not come up at all, or does not improve his\r\ngeneral crop. I wonder if I am going to beat him at his own game and\r\nwith his own corn.\"\r\n\r\nHe immediately selected more of the Brown corn for testing and filled\r\nthe squares of the seed boxes again. Later he proposed to test some of\r\nthe seed corn he had bought from other farmers.\r\n\r\nSome of the seed boxes were in far from a good condition, and the young\r\nfarmer spent the best part of half an hour in fixing them. A smile of\r\nsatisfaction crossed his features as he surveyed his work.\r\n\r\n\"They can't say that I haven't tried to do this right,\" he thought to\r\nhimself. Then he gave a long stretch. \"My! but there's a lot to this\r\nfarm work,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\nBy the time the work on the boxes had been completed Hiram felt\r\nhungry. It was growing dark, and he concluded that he had better get\r\nsomething to eat before doing anything else.\r\n\r\nThere was a dishful of cold potatoes on the shelf, and these he sliced\r\nfor frying. Then he brought out what was left of some cold meat; he\r\nnext prepared to make himself something hot to drink.\r\n\r\nThe young farmer was working around the stove when he heard an unusual\r\nnoise outside. He listened for a few seconds, and then went to the door\r\nand threw it open.\r\n\r\n\"Not a soul in sight,\" he murmured to himself. \"That's queer. I thought\r\nI heard somebody coming. I wonder if it can be some stray animal?\"\r\n\r\nHe walked outside and gave another look around. Neither man nor beast\r\nwas in sight, and, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, he returned to the\r\nshed.\r\n\r\nHiram cooked his supper and then lit a lantern to make his usual turn\r\nabout the premises before going to bed. The barn doors were padlocked,\r\nbut there were small sheds into which wayfarers might crawl and, as\r\nYancey Battick had suggested, the tramp who smokes is the farmer's\r\ndeadly enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark night and a chill wind was whining through the burned\r\npines across the road. Hiram's custom was to go around the barn, try\r\nall the doors, and flash his lantern into the calf-pens and the old\r\nwagon shed. It was when he got down the slant beside the barn to the\r\ndoor which he had recently locked in putting Jerry in his stall, that\r\nhe got a whiff of tobacco smoke.\r\n\r\n\"That bluebird!\" muttered Hiram. \"Where is the scamp?\"\r\n\r\nIt was but a faint odor Hiram smelled--the sickish-sweet odor of a dead\r\npipe; it led to the nearest calf-shelter.\r\n\r\nHe had been getting the pens ready for the young stock Mr. Bronson\r\nwould send up to Sunnyside in a day or two. He had torn one of the\r\nfodder stacks to pieces, and scattered the broken and half-rotted\r\nbundles of fodder over the floor of the shed and pen to dry out and to\r\nbe picked over and trampled by the cattle.\r\n\r\nThere had been nobody on the place this day to his knowledge--certainly\r\nnot before he had driven to Pringleton. And what would bring any proper\r\nvisitor down here to the sheds? But the tobacco smell was stronger as\r\nhe approached the arched opening. A whiff of it was blown directly into\r\nhis nostrils.\r\n\r\nHe reached up to the beam inside the opening and ran his hand along\r\nit--the very place an habitual smoker would be likely to place his pipe\r\non entering the shed, sober or otherwise. Habit is strong.\r\n\r\nThere it was. Although it was cold, Hiram was sure it had not long been\r\nso. He held up his lantern the better to see it. There was a \"heel\" of\r\nhalf-burned tobacco in the pipe. That was what he had smelled.\r\n\r\nThe wabbly ray of the lantern flashed across the shed. Hiram, suddenly\r\nstartled, saw a huddled form lying on the fodder-strewn floor.\r\n\r\nThe young farmer did not fancy handling any individual who was half\r\nintoxicated, as this person probably was. He was no friend to the\r\ndrunkard in any case.\r\n\r\nBut the fellow might have matches in his pocket. In his drunken state\r\nhe might do some damage with them. Besides, it was blowing up cold,\r\nand Hiram felt that he could not sleep warm himself if he knew this\r\nfellow-creature lay here with so little shelter.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the shed and stooped over the stranger. He placed a\r\ntentative hand on the shoulder nearest him. The touch elicited nothing\r\nbut a groan.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty far gone,\" muttered Hiram. \"Well, nothing to do but to roll him\r\nover more comfortably and bring one of Jerry's blankets--\"\r\n\r\nFitting the deed to the words, he moved the man slightly. There was an\r\nimpatient exclamation from the stranger; then, for an instant, his face\r\ncame into the radiance of the lantern as he arose upon his elbow.\r\n\r\nIt was a wild looking and much flushed face. The eyes, seemingly\r\nhalf-filmed with sleep, rolled about but fastened their gaze neither on\r\nHiram nor on anything else. It was a delirious look.\r\n\r\n\"Hey! Wake up!\" urged the young farmer. \"What are you doing here? Who\r\nare you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Orrin Post--that's me! Orrin Post,\" said the stranger, loudly and\r\npromptly. Then he sank back upon the fodder again, and his mind seemed\r\nto sink, too. He only muttered impatiently when Hiram touched him again.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a pretty kettle of fish!\" gasped Hiram. \"What shall I do with\r\nOrrin Post? That is what I should like to be told.\"\r\n\r\nHe had suddenly made another discovery. There was no smell of liquor\r\nabout the fellow. His breath was feverish, but not alcoholic. The man\r\nmost certainly was not drunk.\r\n\r\nThis was no case of leaving the man covered up in the calf shed to\r\n\"sleep it off.\" Whatever was the matter, Hiram was quite sure the\r\nstranger needed more attention than that. If this was the fellow Yancey\r\nBattick had pointed out to him staggering along the road to Sunnyside\r\nFarm, he should have had help right then and there--a doctor, perhaps.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Hiram decided, the sick man must be removed to the\r\nnearest comfortable place; and that place was the incubator house where\r\nhe had made himself so much at home. He rolled the stranger over again\r\nand stretched out his limbs. He was quite as tall as Hiram, if not\r\ntaller; but there was little flesh on his frame, and the young farmer\r\nwas positive the man weighed considerably less than he did.\r\n\r\nHiram knelt down and lifted the sick man across his shoulder, holding\r\nboth wrists as he again staggered to his feet. He picked up the lantern\r\nand started up the path beside the barn. The stranger seemed sunk in\r\ncomplete unconsciousness, only muttering a word now and then.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the young farmer had brought his burden to the shack\r\nwhich he had made his home since coming to Sunnyside. He laid Orrin\r\nPost--if that was his name--in the bunk and began removing his shoes\r\nand outer clothing. His garments were shabby, but of fair quality, and\r\nhis underclothes were clean. He was evidently a fellow who respected\r\nhimself. Perhaps he was not a tramp at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not so much who he was as what he was. Hiram, stripping\r\noff the man's clothing, made a discovery that startled him--then\r\nactually frightened him.\r\n\r\nThe fellow's body was burning up with fever--face, hands, chest. What\r\nwas this? His hand, lightly touching the chest of the victim, revealed\r\nan eruption under the skin. It felt almost like small shot--the\r\nbeginnings of deep-seated postules, perhaps.\r\n\r\nHiram Strong was staggered by the discovery. For a moment he fell back\r\nfrom the bunk. He even turned his gaze on the door, and it is true that\r\nhe thought of escape.\r\n\r\nThe highly inflammatory fever; the eruption on the chest. That it was a\r\nmalignant disease of some kind he knew, and he believed he recognized\r\nthe symptoms as those of the most deadly of all diseases that ever\r\nbecomes epidemic in a temperate climate.\r\n\r\n\"Smallpox!\" the young farmer muttered. \"This fellow's got it sure\r\nenough, and I have exposed myself to it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                            A FRIEND INDEED\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram Strong was not likely to forget the experiences of that night. He\r\ndid not feel that he was braver than anyone else in remaining with the\r\ndelirious man and doing what he could for him. Merely, he did not see\r\nhow he could ever respect himself again if he deserted the stranger.\r\n\r\nAnd to desert the sick man was to desert, as well, Sunnyside Farm and\r\nhis employment. Hiram could not do that. But he realized that, if this\r\nwas a case of smallpox as it seemed to be, he had made a pesthouse\r\nof the shed in which he had camped for these few weeks, and none of\r\nthe expected workmen would remain on the place while the case was\r\ndeveloping.\r\n\r\nHowever, he plucked up sufficient courage to go back at once to the\r\nsick man and complete his preparations for bed. He had already exposed\r\nhimself to infection, and if he, too, was doomed to the disease, he\r\nbelieved he could do nothing now to prevent it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was something extremely dreadful to him in the\r\nthought of smallpox--mainly, perhaps, because of the possible scars to\r\nbe left on the body.\r\n\r\nHiram neglected the unfortunate man not at all, however. Distasteful as\r\nthe thought of handling him was, the youth that night did all in his\r\npower for the stranger's comfort.\r\n\r\nHe kept water at boiling temperature on the stove, and made a wash\r\nwith soda with which he bathed the sick man several times to reduce\r\nthe fever. The purple face, the puffed eyelids, the drooling lips,\r\naltogether made the victim a most unpleasant looking object.\r\n\r\nYet Hiram thought that, in his right mind and free of fever, this\r\nfellow who called himself Orrin Post might be a very good looking man\r\nindeed. And he judged his age to be not far along in the twenties.\r\n\r\nHiram got no sleep at all. The patient began to thrash about toward\r\nmorning and was more delirious than before. Occasionally he seemed to\r\nbe taken with a slight chill, and his nurse kept the temperature of the\r\nlittle room much higher than 70°.\r\n\r\n\"This might be good for that corn test,\" Hiram once thought.\r\n\r\nBut he was not giving much attention to anything but his care of Orrin\r\nPost. He harked back to Mother Atterson's recipes for caring for\r\npersons who were ill. He found a stone bottle and filled that with hot\r\nwater and put it to the patient's feet to counteract the chills. He\r\nwished he had some medicine to give him. Hiram wondered how he could\r\nsend for a doctor in the morning. Whom could he get to go? And would a\r\ndoctor come to attend a smallpox patient--any doctor but the physician\r\nfor the county's poor?\r\n\r\nOccasionally he examined that eruption. It was spreading over the man's\r\nchest. If it _was_ smallpox--\r\n\r\nWhat a night that was! At daybreak--a chill and darksome dawn--Hiram\r\nwent to the door, looked out, and finally stepped out and closed the\r\ndoor behind him. His eyelids were swollen for lack of sleep. He was\r\ntired to the bone!\r\n\r\nThe pale light in the sky grew slowly. Something stirred in the\r\nroad--toward the Pringle cottage. Miss Pringle and Abigail were always\r\nearly risers. And here came one of them along the road!\r\n\r\n\"Hiram Strong! is that you? For the land's sake what have you been\r\nhavin' a light in your window for the whole live-long night?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the energetic voice of his neighbor. She hurried\r\nin at the gate, her head and arms wrapped in a shawl.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sick, or what is it?\" pursued Miss Pringle. \"I said to\r\nAbigail, 'I'm going to find out what that light means if it's the last\r\nact of my life--and before I have my breakfast, too!' I declare I waked\r\nup a dozen times during the night and saw your light winkin' at me just\r\nlike a star. What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't come any nearer, please, Miss Pringle,\" Hiram broke in. \"You\r\nmustn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mustn't what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come any nearer to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you, Hiram Strong? You ain't going to explode\r\nlike dynamite, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's worse than dynamite.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the land's sake! what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is smallpox,\" said Hiram, his voice on the point of breaking.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" gasped the woman. \"Smallpox? You haven't got such a\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not--not yet,\" Hiram said. Then he told her about his visitor\r\nand how he had found Orrin Post in the calf pen.\r\n\r\n\"And you've been tending him all night, Hiram! You poor fellow!\"\r\nexclaimed Miss Pringle, bustling forward again.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! But you must not come here!\" cried Hiram. \"You find somebody to\r\nsend to fetch a doctor. I'll stay and look after the fellow now I've\r\nbegun the job.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you don't really know it's smallpox. I'd took nice getting Dr.\r\nMarble up here, tellin' him it was smallpox, and then having it turn\r\nout to be nothing of the kind. He'd never let me hear the last of it.\r\nLet me see this Orrin Post.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Miss Pringle, you must not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go along! Do you think I'm afraid, Hiram Strong? I guess I'm just as\r\nbrave as you are.\"\r\n\r\nShe pushed right by him and went into the house. The air was warm and\r\nclose, and she sniffed it energetically.\r\n\r\n\"If smallpox was much developed you could smell it, Hiram,\" she\r\ndeclared. \"No mistake about that. The poor fellow! How red he is! Looks\r\nmore like scarlet fever, if you ask me.\"\r\n\r\nShe went to the bunk and placed her soft, cool palm on the patient's\r\nforehead. Almost instantly his head stopped weaving from side to side\r\non the pillow. He sighed and murmured, asking for water.\r\n\r\nHiram caught up the pitcher and went out to the pump. When he returned\r\nMiss Pringle had been examining the sick man's chest. She straightened\r\nup and looked back over her shoulder at Hiram. The grin with which she\r\nfavored him was the most beautiful smile the young fellow had ever\r\nbeheld.\r\n\r\n\"Men certainly are helpless creatures,\" she said, breaking into a\r\nchuckle. \"Though I will say you're better than most, Hiram Strong. Put\r\nout that lamp. Don't let it shine in his eyes. He wants to be in the\r\ndark as much as possible. He's developing as fine a case of measles as\r\nI ever saw and that's a fact!\"\r\n\r\nRelieved? Hiram Strong could have readily and heartily given three\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\n\"I--I've had the measles, Miss Pringle,\" he said warmly. \"How glad I am\r\nyou came over. I'm not afraid of measles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hope not! Though I guess this fellow's got 'em pretty hard.\r\nIt is sometimes serious with folks as old as he is. But we'll pull him\r\nthrough, Hiram--you and me together,\" she added with her old-time smirk.\r\n\r\nBut she could not disturb Hiram's equanimity now.\r\n\r\n\"You are a friend in need, Miss Pringle,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I should hope so! Those are the only friends to have--especially in\r\nthe country. We all need to help each other out here on the farms.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll get a doctor for him,\" said Hiram, promptly. \"I'll pay the fee.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll spend your money in no such foolish way,\" declared Miss\r\nPringle, energetically. \"I'd be ashamed to have the neighbors know I\r\nsent for Dr. Marble for a case of measles.\r\n\r\n\"You've treated this poor fellow all right, Hiram, as far as you've\r\ngone. After breakfast I'll come back with some medicine I've got to\r\nreduce his fever. You'll have enough to do around here daytimes tending\r\nto your work. I'll do the nursing for the poor fellow during the day if\r\nyou'll look after him at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"My goodness!\" said Hiram, with fervor, \"I'll do all I can. It is a\r\nrelief to know it isn't smallpox.\"\r\n\r\n\"You musn't neglect your work,\" Miss Pringle said, as they both came\r\nout of the house again. \"You've got some men coming, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a day or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"That Ad Banks was around yesterday, wasn't he? I guess he's after a\r\njob with you, after all, even if you are a mite young for a boss,\" and\r\nshe chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"I did not see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That so? I saw him hanging about the barn and smoking that old pipe of\r\nhis.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can't get into the barn very easily. The doors are all locked,\"\r\nsaid Hiram. Then, suddenly remembering the pipe he had found, he drew\r\nit from his pocket. \"Could this be Adam Banks' pipe?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Guess it could--and it is,\" said Miss Pringle promptly, sniffing at\r\nthe odorous pipe. \"I'd know that old thing anywhere. It's Ad Banks'.\r\nWhere'd you find it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where it had no business to be. Inside one of the sheds. Funny it\r\nshould have been down there, too. I thought it belonged to this Orrin\r\nPost. I wonder what that Banks fellow was doing down there?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Pringle bustled away and Hiram set about getting his own\r\nbreakfast. The sick man murmured for water occasionally, but otherwise\r\nneeded little attention until Miss Pringle came back.\r\n\r\n\"Yancey Battick is all wrong about Delia Pringle,\" thought Hiram. \"She\r\nmay have her peculiarities, but she has a heart of gold.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                               FRICTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first truck to arrive that day at Sunnyside instead of bringing\r\nlumber, bricks, or other building material, brought ten yearling steers\r\nthat Mr. Bronson had picked up from his other farms; and Hiram turned\r\nthe blatting, frisky creatures into the pen and shed in which he had\r\nfound Orrin Post the evening before.\r\n\r\nOne of the young cattle had a frayed bit of rope about its neck, and\r\nHiram went into the pen to get it off. The yearling ran into the far\r\ncorner of the shed and while he struggled to remove the rope, the young\r\nfarmer's eye caught the glint of something on the beams where he had\r\nfound the pipe that Miss Pringle declared was Adam Banks' property.\r\n\r\nHe had already looked about the shed for anything the sick man might\r\nhave dropped. There had been absolutely nothing in his clothes but a\r\nlittle change and a pocketknife--no letter, or paper, or keepsake of\r\nany kind. Nor had Hiram seen anything in the fodder where Orrin Post\r\nhad lain.\r\n\r\nHe reached up to this beam and out of the far corner, where a thin ray\r\nof sunshine entered, he plucked a pint flask half filled with an amber\r\ncolored liquid, one sniff of which assured him was the probable product\r\nof a peach-still somewhere in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the pipe he had previously found, Hiram might have\r\nbelieved this raw brandy the property of Orrin Post, in spite of the\r\nfact that the condition in which the poor fellow had been when he took\r\nshelter in the shed seemed to preclude his having hidden the brandy\r\nflask.\r\n\r\nThe sick man was scarcely in his senses all that day. Every time Hiram\r\nput his head in at the door of the incubator house, he found Miss\r\nPringle either fixing up the room, giving the patient his medicine, or\r\nsitting sewing within reach of the bunk. She made Hiram go over to her\r\nhouse for his dinner, and Abigail Wentworth, a tall, gaunt, elderly\r\nwoman with spectacles and a neat cap pinned upon her iron-grey hair to\r\nhide her bald spot, served him a most satisfying, as well as appetizing\r\nmeal. He had not eaten many such since coming to Sunnyside Farm.\r\n\r\n\"I don't wish to seem harsh, Mr. Strong,\" said Abigail, \"but it does\r\nseem a blessing that that man came along and was taken sick as he was.\r\nIt's given Miss Delia something to do besides clutterin' up my kitchen.\r\nI am blessed beyond all when some of the neighbors fall sick and will\r\nlet Miss Delia in to nurse 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see she is a wonderful nurse,\" said Hiram approvingly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she'll do less harm that way than most,\" said Abigail, who\r\nseldom was known to approve thoroughly of anything finite. \"But that's\r\nwhat made trouble between her and that Yance Battick, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He was pretty near down sick--just hobblin' around. Rheumatism\r\nand all. That old Pringle house is as damp as the grave. Miss Delia\r\nheard how bad off he was and off she marched with her pills and\r\nplasters and what-not. But Yance Battick wasn't goin' to let no woman\r\ninto his house--and he told her so to her face.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think Mr. Battick understands Miss Pringle's character,\" said\r\nHiram. \"He does not realize how very kind she means to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Means to be'--yes. That's it. I never could give three cheers for\r\nthose folks that always mean so much better than they do,\" sniffed\r\nthe angular woman, who could not even speak in entire approval of her\r\nemployer. \"But it's wisdom to let fellows like Yance Battick alone.\r\nBesides,\" she added, dropping her voice, \"there's dark doin's in that\r\nhouse of Battick's. Ain't no place for a decent, respectable woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it!\" exclaimed Hiram, rather amused. \"I stopped there\r\nover night, and I saw nothing much out of the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You weren't let to,\" said Abigail pursing her lips. \"There's those\r\nthat say Yance Battick is deeper than Sim Paget's well--and _it_ never\r\nhad no bottom! He's got a power of knowledge that never came out of\r\nbooks. And no man would ever be so crotchety and shy off his fellowmen\r\nlike Yance Battick does, if he wasn't sold, body and soul, to the\r\ndevil.\"\r\n\r\nHiram found no answer to this statement. It was evident that Abigail\r\nWentworth, lineal descendant of Salem Puritans transplanted to this\r\nMiddle West, possessed superstitions that are popular still in some\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nThe following day Mr. Bronson came up to Sunnyside himself with some\r\nmore young cattle. He had heard of the \"tramp\" Hiram had taken in and\r\nwhom Miss Pringle was nursing. Hiram had had rather a hard night with\r\nhis patient; but he was freshened up when his employer arrived.\r\n\r\n\"You are a good chap, Hi,\" Mr. Bronson said. \"But you'll overdo some\r\nday, helping all the yellow dogs that come your way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better speak to Miss Pringle about it, too,\" grinned Hiram. \"And we're\r\nnot altogether sure he is a canine of the breed you mention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll take him back with me to the Plympton hospital--if you say\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that would be best. Miss Pringle says he is coming along\r\nall right. He is pretty measly right now, and he might catch cold if he\r\nwas moved and then they'd 'strike in,' so she says. Then he'd be worse\r\noff. Guess I've got him on my hands for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's your funeral,\" Mr. Bronson said.\r\n\r\n\"And it might have been Orrin Post's funeral if I hadn't found him as I\r\ndid. Hello!\" he added, as he observed the loutish figure of Adam Banks\r\napproaching. \"Here's a fellow wants to see you, I guess, Mr. Bronson.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about?\"\r\n\r\n\"He _says_ he wants work. But he doesn't want to hire out to me--I'm\r\ntoo young,\" laughed Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want him? I understand you are about ready to put a gang of\r\nditchers to work in that wheat field. But you haven't told me what kind\r\nof underdraining you are going to do there. Tile is awfully expensive\r\njust now, Hiram.\"\r\n\r\nAdam Banks slouched into hearing before Hiram could reply.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" asked Mr. Bronson briskly of the newcomer. \"Do you wish to see\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear you are hiring men for spring work, Mr. Bronson,\" said Banks\r\nrespectfully. \"I'd like a job.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not hiring anybody at Sunnyside,\" the farm owner said promptly.\r\n\"That is all in Mr. Strong's hands. If he likes your looks and can make\r\nuse of you--\"\r\n\r\n\"That kid!\" interrupted Adam Banks, turning red in the face and glaring\r\nscornfully at Hiram. \"I want work all right, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't act as though you do,\" Mr. Bronson interposed. \"Mr. Strong\r\nis in charge here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you get a man to run your farm for you, Mr. Bronson?\" asked\r\nBanks boldly. \"You know my dad owns a good farm, and I've been brought\r\nup to work. And I'm a voter. Why don't you give a young man like me a\r\nchance to show you what can be done here on Sunnyside?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now,\" Mr. Bronson said, his eyes twinkling, \"I really didn't\r\nknow about you when I was looking about for a farmer. What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ad Banks. You know my dad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume so. Well, Mr. Banks, I fear it is too late now. A bargain is\r\na bargain. I have hired Mr. Strong--\"\r\n\r\n\"But that fellow ain't of age. You can see that plain. Your contract\r\nain't binding if he's under age--and he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? Then you are quite a lawyer as well as a farmer, Mr. Banks.\r\nHowever, I always consider a contract binding, with whomever made.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned away; but Adam Banks did not lack persistence. He urged:\r\n\r\n\"If you ain't found out yet whether this Strong can fill the bill or\r\nno, I might be handy if I was working for you here, Mr. Bronson. I\r\ncould jump right in and take hold when he gets into trouble--as he\r\nwill. What are you paying for day's work?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not paying anything. I tell you, young man, Mr. Strong will do\r\nall the hiring. And the discharging, too, for that matter. Do you want\r\nthis fellow, Hiram?\" he asked the young farm manager bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"Say, what use is there askin' him?\" broke in Banks, with disgust.\r\n\"He's heard what I said. He knows what I think of him for a boss. What\r\nchance is there of my getting a job on his say-so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I cannot make use of Mr. Banks,\" said Hiram quietly.\r\n\r\n\"No! Of course you can't. You'd ruther take in tramps. I hear you've\r\nbegun that. And we don't think much of tramps in these parts.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson merely smiled, waiting to see how Hiram Strong would handle\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\n\"Just because you made a bid for my job doesn't influence me to refuse\r\nyour services, Mr. Banks,\" the boy from the East said. \"But I have two\r\nthings against you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's them?\" demanded Banks sneeringly.\r\n\r\n\"Here they are,\" Hiram told him, and drew the pipe from one pocket and\r\nthe flask of peach-brandy from another. \"Here is your pipe that you\r\nleft in one of our sheds day before yesterday, with burning tobacco\r\nin it. And the quantity of peach-brandy you had evidently drunk out\r\nof this flask made you forget both pipe and bottle. Neither of these\r\nthings find favor in my sight about a farm, either inside or outside of\r\na man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be switched!\" ejaculated Adam Banks. \"Huh!\"\r\n\r\nHis face blazed up and he gave every indication of having been caught\r\nwith the goods. He even accepted the pipe and flask. Both Hiram and Mr.\r\nBronson had already smelled liquor upon Adam Banks' breath. At least,\r\nhe had had something besides ham and eggs for breakfast. But suddenly\r\nthe loutish fellow decided not to acknowledge the ownership of the\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" he growled. \"These ain't mine. What are you trying to put over\r\non me, Strong? More'n likely they were brought on the place by that\r\ntramp you've taken up with. I ain't been near your sheds.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were seen there,\" Hiram said sharply. \"More than that, your pipe\r\nhas been identified. There is no use denying either fact. I shall not\r\nhire you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to let me be treated like this, Mr. Bronson?\" demanded\r\nAdam Banks. \"Dad's a neighbor. We live right here. That upstart,\r\nStrong--\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" interrupted Mr. Bronson, waving his hand in dismissal.\r\n\"If Hiram doesn't want you that closes the discussion as far as I am\r\nconcerned,\" and he walked away with his young farm manager, leaving\r\nBanks in the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                              WORK BEGINS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'd keep my eye on that fellow Banks if he continues to hang around\r\nhere,\" said Mr. Bronson. \"He means you ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"And perhaps would do something to cause trouble. Perhaps I should have\r\ntaken him on,\" Hiram Strong said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I should say not! You did just right. You read him aright. His prime\r\nfailings are drink and laziness. Just warn him off the premises if he\r\nbothers you. He's been in trouble and is not locally liked. Mr. Banks\r\nspared the rod in Adam's case, sure enough.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Hiram, to get back to ditching. You don't mean to leave open\r\nditches through that field, do you? I can't stand a ditch bank--always\r\ngrowing up in wild cherry and poison oak and such worthless trees and\r\nvines. Besides, open ditches interfere with tillage most abominably.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is farthest from my thought, Mr. Bronson.\"\r\n\r\n\"But tiling--\"\r\n\r\n\"I figure to underdrain with something much cheaper than tile,\" the\r\nyoung farmer declared.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to use?\"\r\n\r\nHiram pointed across the road at Miss Pringle's patch of scorched\r\nwoodland. The underbrush and sprouts were beginning to show that faint\r\nblur of green that announces the coming of spring growth; but the trees\r\nwere gaunt looking and black.\r\n\r\n\"I've bought as many as I can use of those scorched trees at ten cents\r\napiece,\" Hiram explained.\r\n\r\n\"For the land's sake!\" exclaimed Mr. Bronson, quoting Miss Pringle, but\r\nlooking puzzled, too.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. For the land's sake. For the improvement of that twenty\r\nacres--or such of it as needs draining.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--Hiram--my dear fellow--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not starting something that I cannot put over, Mr. Bronson,\"\r\nlaughed Hiram. \"Nor is it a brand new idea of my own. I have seen\r\ntimber in the rough employed in underdraining more than once. My father\r\nused to do it when the man who owned the farm father worked would not\r\nlisten to the expense of tiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! I acknowledge the corn,\" replied Mr. Bronson.\r\n\r\n\"I am not criticising you, Mr. Bronson. You are preparing this farm\r\nfor a sale. You wish to put it in as good shape as possible at as small\r\nexpense as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, young man.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we will put in a drain that will answer every purpose of tiling for\r\na few years. In very low, wet ground logs laid in a ditch, and covered,\r\nwill last twenty years--sometimes forty. On this upland the life of the\r\ntimber I mean to use will not be so long.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is fire-killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes no difference. I've been over there and looked at it. You\r\ncouldn't knock any of those trees down. The fire went through there\r\nonly last year. They are not punky.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose not.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we shall be killing two birds with one stone--getting cheap\r\ndrainage and likewise wiping out a very ugly spot right across the road\r\nfrom your new house.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so. And you are getting the timbers cheap enough, if they are\r\nany good. I wouldn't have had the heart to offer Miss Pringle such a\r\nprice.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is more than anybody else would have given her,\" Hiram declared,\r\nsmiling. \"And it is worth all you are paying for it to have those\r\nunsightly sticks chopped down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess you are right, Hiram.\"\r\n\r\n\"The logs will serve the purpose we want them for very well indeed.\r\nWe'll lay two in the bottom of the ditch, six inches or so apart, and\r\na third log on top to cover the aperture. Earth packed down upon them\r\nwill soon form a firm culvert into which all the superfluous water will\r\ndrain.\r\n\r\n\"I'll put a man into Miss Pringle's patch with an axe and soon knock\r\ndown everything that is standing. The whole patch will be covered with\r\ngreen by midsummer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smart boy, Hiram!\" exclaimed Mr. Bronson. \"Will you snake the logs\r\nright across the road into the wheat field?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the ditches are begun and you send up that pair of\r\nPercherons you promised me. I can't do that work with Jerry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have the Percherons in a few days. They are a well mated\r\npair and young. By the way, your disc-plow, harrow, check-row planter,\r\nand the mowing machine are on the siding at Pringleton. I'll send a\r\ntruck over for them tomorrow. We don't want any demurrage charges\r\npiling up on us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! I want to see those things on the big floor of the barn,\" cried\r\nHiram, his eyes beaming.\r\n\r\n\"I'd better send up a machinist to help you set them up, hadn't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. Leave it to me. I must learn to put together every machine\r\nthat comes onto the place. There are always instructions sent with the\r\nimplements from the factory. The time may come, right in the middle of\r\na job of importance, that the machine will balk. I've got to know all\r\nabout it. Do you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. And you are right, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bronson, seems to me I'll be just about made when I sit up on that\r\nplow and chirrup to those Percherons. I've tramped along in the furrow\r\nbehind one or two horses for so many years--Well!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson laughed. \"While I've ridden a plow and other farm tools\r\nso much that I hate to get up on one,\" he said. \"They say it's mighty\r\ngood exercise for a sluggish liver to ride 'em over hobbly ground.\r\nAh, my boy! you've got the best of it, for you are young. You've got\r\nenthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, so have you, Mr. Bronson,\" cried Hiram. \"Only it is enthusiasm of\r\na different kind from mine. Otherwise you would not buy farms and put\r\nthem into shape for other men to run.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe that is merely business.\"\r\n\r\nBefore night Orrin Post was quite in his right mind. Abigail had been\r\nmaking broth and porridge for him, for now that his fever was reduced\r\nMiss Pringle's idea of nursing seemed to be to stuff the patient with\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\"She will kill me with kindness,\" the young man said to Hiram. \"I hope\r\nI shall not have to lie here long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Pringle is awfully good,\" the young farm manager said stoutly. \"I\r\ndo not know what we would have done without her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what I would have done without you, Mr. Strong. She's\r\ntold me how you thought I had smallpox, and yet picked me up and\r\nbrought me here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got the cart before the horse,\" chuckled Hiram. \"I got you up\r\nhere from that shed before I discovered that you were breaking out in\r\nsuch shape. How did you get to the shed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't a very clear remembrance of it,\" confessed Orrin Post. \"I\r\nfelt pretty bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had you traveled far?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a job with a farmer all winter at Roundspring. But I was taken\r\ndown with this fever and he told me I had better go because he was\r\nafraid his children would catch it. I couldn't blame him--much. So I\r\nstarted west.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't there any place they would take you in? No hospital?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't happen to stop at a hospital,\" said Orrin Post dryly.\r\n\r\n\"And nobody offered to do anything for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not remember that any one did. I was kind of flighty the last day\r\nor two, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you heading for home?\" asked Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"If I was I didn't know it,\" Post said with a faint laugh.\r\n\r\n\"But where is your home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anywhere I hang up my hat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm giving it to you straight.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are the best friend I ever had,\" declared the young man, with\r\nsudden emotion. \"Nobody ever put himself out for me before that I can\r\nremember.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't make too much of what little I have done,\" Hiram urged.\r\n\"Where do you go from here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the first idea. I'll get out as soon as I can--\"\r\n\r\n\"If you say that I'll take your clothes away,\" declared Hiram promptly.\r\n\"You've got to eat many a gallon of Miss Pringle's broth and porridge\r\nbefore you get a chance to leave Sunnyside.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Sunnyside,'\" repeated Orrin Post wistfully. \"Is that the name of this\r\nfarm, Mr. Strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be a pleasant place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that myself yet,\" laughed Hiram, \"I have been here so\r\nshort a time.\"\r\n\r\nAnd for the next few days Hiram Strong was so busy that he was not at\r\nall sure whether or not he would like it himself at Sunnyside Farm.\r\n\r\nHe set a gang of a dozen men to ditching in the twenty acre lot. He\r\ncould have made much better time with a ditching machine; but of course\r\nit would not have paid to hire such an implement for this small job.\r\n\r\nHe had been all over the wheat field and had made a mental plan of what\r\nhe wished to do before a spadeful of earth was thrown. He proposed\r\nrunning a ditch the entire length of the field, through the middle and\r\nparallel with the road on which the twenty-acre piece bordered. On the\r\nwetter portion of the piece he proposed having transverse ditches every\r\nhundred feet. Where the land seemed naturally better drained he would\r\nhave the cross ditches dug less frequently.\r\n\r\nThe county ditch beside the road was deep enough and clean enough to\r\ncarry off an immense volume of water. The natural drainage of the land\r\nwas toward the road; therefore nobody could complain of his using the\r\ncounty ditch as he intended.\r\n\r\nWith a cross-cut saw they fitted the logs to match at the intersection\r\nof the ditches and there he laid a cap of heavy planking which chanced\r\nto be about the place. Any bit of rough lumber answered this purpose.\r\n\r\nAs fast as the timbers were laid they covered them, tamping the earth\r\nover them firmly and leaving a very slight ridge through the field.\r\nSnaking the logs across the field did not damage the wheat much, for\r\nHiram made the driver of the horses follow a single path--that of the\r\nmain ditch--both coming and going.\r\n\r\nThe man Hiram had hired to cut the timber was very dexterous with the\r\naxe, but after the first day he raised decided objections to working in\r\nthe half-burned area. He was smutted from head to foot and looked like\r\na charcoal burner.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry,\" the young farm manager told him, \"if you find the work\r\ndifferent from what you supposed it to be. I told you plainly enough\r\nwhat I wanted you for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let some of the other fellows take their turn in that patch, and I'll\r\ndo a little digging. That's clean work,\" said the man.\r\n\r\n\"No. I hired you because I was told you were a good axman. I hired the\r\nother men for ditching. You can chop better than you can ditch, and the\r\nothers can use a spade better than an axe; I want the most I can get\r\nfor my money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose that's fair enough,\" agreed the man grudgingly. \"But\r\nwhat my wife will say when she sees this jumper will be a plenty.\"\r\n\r\nHe was in no better mood the second day; and that afternoon Hiram saw\r\nAdam Banks stroll along the road and go upon the burned-over piece\r\nto speak to the woodchopper. There was not so much tree cutting done\r\nduring the next hour, and it vexed the young farm manager.\r\n\r\n\"It seems, as Mr. Bronson suggested, that I am bound to have trouble\r\nwith that fellow, whether I hire him or not,\" Hiram reflected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                                 WHEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Hiram received his first letter since\r\nleaving Scoville from Sister. He was glad to hear personally from her,\r\nand about her wonderful fortune as well; but it must be confessed\r\nthat had the letter been from a certain other girl he would have been\r\nequally pleased.\r\n\r\nHe had heard of Lettie Bronson frequently from her father. She would\r\ngraduate from St. Beris in June and come home to Plympton. Then, Hiram\r\nhoped, he would see her occasionally at Sunnyside Farm.\r\n\r\nSecretly the young fellow was particularly pleased with his new\r\nposition as farm manager because it gave him an opportunity to delegate\r\nthe heavier and dirtier work to his workmen. If Lettie came on the\r\nplace he would be able to go to meet her in decent clothes and with\r\nclean hands.\r\n\r\nSister's letter was very friendly and newsy; but upon reading it a\r\nsecond time Hiram thought he observed in it a tone that was not like\r\nthat of the Sister he had previously known. She had been wont to be\r\nrather fly-away and careless of speech and act. Now there was a sudden\r\nprimness in the way she expressed herself which must, Hiram thought,\r\narise from the feeling of responsibility which her new circumstances\r\nhad brought to her.\r\n\r\nBut here spoke the old tender-hearted, if imaginative, Sister:\r\n\r\n    \"I wish I could go out myself, Hiram, and find my little brother.\r\n    Just think of his running away--even from a reform school--into\r\n    the world all stark alone! I don't know anything more about him\r\n    than that--not even what his first name is. It seems my Grandmother\r\n    Cheltenham hired the lawyer to find us both before she died, but\r\n    she would do nothing for Brother and me until we were both found.\r\n    So all that I can do is to wait patiently. I hope the poor boy will\r\n    come to no harm.\"\r\n\r\nShe signed the letter: \"I-don't-know-my-first-name-yet Cheltenham.\" But\r\nHiram could imagine how proud and happy Sister was with a real name of\r\nher own.\r\n\r\n\"Bless her dear little heart,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\nThe carpenters began to arrive at Sunnyside, and the shack, first to be\r\nused for a bunkhouse and kitchen, was soon put up. It would comfortably\r\nhouse twenty men, the bunks being built along the walls and a long\r\ntable and benches occupying the middle of the room. Hiram took his old\r\nbed in the small house after Orrin Post moved in with the other men,\r\nand the incubator house was fumigated.\r\n\r\n\"For as long as you are used to farmwork,\" Hiram had told Orrin, \"why\r\nshould you not stay here and work for me when you get strong enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a good fellow, Strong!\" declared the friendless one. \"You\r\nwon't be sorry that you took me in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" Hiram said, his eyes twinkling, \"I figure to get all of my money\r\nback on you, Orrin.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something about Orrin Post that Hiram found very attractive,\r\nand yet the fellow was as secretive about his personal history as\r\nthough his past life was something to be ashamed of.\r\n\r\nHe proved to be, now that he was convalescent, a good looking young\r\nman, rather frail of physique, but manly in every way. Because of his\r\nenunciation and judging, also, by little turns of expression in his use\r\nof English, Hiram thought Orrin came, too, from New England. He was\r\nintelligent and to all appearances well-educated.\r\n\r\nBut never did the latter drop a word to reveal what his upbringing\r\nor his former state had been, save that he had worked on farms. He\r\nappeared to have none of the vices of the common tramp; he was polite,\r\nclean-mouthed, and an easy and fluent speaker on almost any subject but\r\nthat of his private affairs.\r\n\r\nHe read everything there was to read--books, papers, magazines, even\r\na pile of old poultry journals Brandenburg had left in the incubator\r\nshed. Miss Pringle pronounced him to be \"real nice\" and lent him all\r\nthe books and papers she owned.\r\n\r\nNow that Orrin Post was out of danger and there were so many men about\r\nSunnyside Farm, the spinster did not visit them so often. But Hiram\r\nand Orrin sometimes called on her in the evening. In numbers there is\r\nsafety, Hiram thought, while Orrin did not seem to be at all disturbed\r\nby any of Delia Pringle's languishing ways.\r\n\r\nThat he was grateful both to the good-hearted spinster and to Hiram\r\nthey could not doubt. Orrin began to do light jobs for both very soon.\r\nOne thing, he relieved Hiram altogether of the care of the more than\r\ntwenty cattle that the young farm manager was feeding in the pens\r\nbehind the big barn.\r\n\r\nIt was Orrin, too, who assisted Hiram in setting up the farm machinery\r\nthat had arrived. He seemed to have some idea of mechanics, and Hiram\r\nalways found him of considerable assistance.\r\n\r\nThe two-disc plow was the first implement they set up. It was a\r\nsplendidly built machine, one of the newest on the market, and could be\r\npulled by either tractor or horses.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson did not intend to use a tractor much at Sunnyside; at\r\nleast, not this first season. When the season's work really commenced\r\nhe would have all his present tractors could do on his other farms.\r\n\r\n\"But with these young elephants,\" Orrin said, admiring the pair of\r\nPercherons when they had arrived, \"you ought to be able to do almost\r\nanything, Mr. Strong.\"\r\n\r\nThe horses were really huge fellows, quiet, kindly, and well broken to\r\nwork. They were not much like the horses Hiram had been used to in the\r\nEast, it must be confessed. Even Jerry, who was a good cross of Morgan\r\nand Canadian stock, looked truly Lilliputian beside these huge fellows.\r\n\r\nWhen the Percherons started one of the largest logs in the burned\r\npiece, the driver chanced to steer them wrong at one point and the\r\nfoot-and-a-half butt of the pine-log rammed a stump. The force of the\r\nblow, with the horses leaning against their collars, split the pine-log\r\nfor half its length.\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" said Will Pardee, the driver, \"let me tackle them to the corner\r\nof that barn, and I bet I could start it. Aside from a steam engine,\r\nthey are the best pullers I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\nThe carpenter gang was now at work and the material for the stave silo\r\nhad arrived. All but the wire cables with which Hiram had advised that\r\nit should be stayed. But those were promised.\r\n\r\nIt was to be a hundred-and-forty-ton silo--one of the largest of the\r\nold-fashioned kind--and its foundation was of masonry. Under proper\r\nconditions it would last for years if the walls (the staves were\r\ngrooved and tongued) were properly erected. The silo was placed at one\r\ncorner of the barn just where it would be handy to shred and blow the\r\nensilage into the enormous round tank.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hiram had continued his corn testing, and to his\r\nsatisfaction. Having selected the good ears among those he had bought\r\nof Mr. Brown, discarding the less vigorous, he shelled the remaining\r\ncorn off these good ears and mixed the kernels thoroughly. This seed he\r\nsacked, tagging it plainly, and hung it where Yancey Battick's dread\r\nenemies, the rats, would not get at it.\r\n\r\nThis bag of corn would not furnish Hiram with all the seed he would\r\nneed at planting time. He had other corn to test and his testing boxes\r\nwere busy for some weeks.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he had tried out the little handful of wheat he had\r\nbrought with him from Yancey Battick's place. The vigor and uniformity\r\nof that red-streaked wheat was quite remarkable. Never had Hiram Strong\r\nseen a wheat that pleased him as much as did this new grain.\r\n\r\nHe was deeply interested in Yancey Battick's experiment with this\r\nwheat; but he did not know how to go about gaining the odd man's\r\nconfidence. Really, he was on less familiar terms with Battick than\r\nwith any other neighbors about Sunnyside--save, perhaps, the rascally\r\nAdam Banks.\r\n\r\nThe latter came around occasionally and talked with the men working for\r\nHiram and interfered in a small way with the ditching and the chopping\r\ndown of the pine trees. But Hiram was determined to have no trouble\r\nwith the fellow if he could help it.\r\n\r\nHe had been told that Adam Banks had quarreled with a farmer for whom\r\nhe had worked, and later, when that farmer's barns were fired, the\r\nowner had declared that Adam Banks had done the firing. But nothing\r\ncould be proved against the fellow.\r\n\r\nThere had been a few warm days; but the ground was not ready for corn\r\nplowing, and Hiram was to raise no oats this year. Nor did he give\r\nany attention to potatoes or other truck crops. Primarily his job at\r\nSunnyside was to raise corn--with a proper rotation of clover and\r\ngrains to keep the soil of the farm in arable condition.\r\n\r\nHe had mapped the farm and planned his work of seeding for the year,\r\nboth on the land that had lain fallow over winter and that already in\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nHe did not like the looks of the wheat on the upper twenty acres where\r\nthe ditching was being done. It had not stooled properly; there were\r\npatches where it was winter killed because of the poor drainage. He\r\nknew the crop on this piece would scarcely pay for harvesting.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he understood that both lime and commercial fertilizer had\r\nbeen used heavily on this acreage before it was seeded the previous\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\"The standing water has made the land soggy. You can't grow crops on a\r\nsponge--at least, not wheat,\" he told himself. \"The fertility put into\r\nthe soil for this wheat is still here, or it has evaporated or leached\r\naway. Surely the lime has not done all its work in releasing the\r\nnatural fertility which the soil possesses. This piece should not need\r\nliming again for three years.\r\n\r\n\"If I can get this wheat off in time for an ensilage crop--first\r\nbroadcasting the coarse manure from the cattle pens--I might make a\r\nshowing on the profit side of the ledger, for this piece, ditching and\r\nall, by the next year. Ensilage corn and peas together would make this\r\ntwenty acres look pretty good.\"\r\n\r\nThus he dreamed. He walked about the other wheat fields. None of the\r\ngrain was as seriously injured as was that on the twenty-acre piece\r\nbordering this much traveled section of the county road.\r\n\r\nThrough a rift in the strip of woodland between the Sunnyside fields\r\nand Yancey Battick's place, he saw a lovely plain of green. It looked\r\nso very different from his own wheatlands that Hiram ventured across\r\nthe boundary fence to examine the patch more closely.\r\n\r\nHere was not more than an acre of level, wheat-covered land. He saw\r\nthat the grain had been sown very thinly; and yet the plants had\r\nstooled so well that, at a little distance, it seemed as though the\r\nground was matted by the grain plants.\r\n\r\nIf this was the red-streaked wheat it must be wonderfully productive.\r\nAt least, the plant itself was thrifty and lush--far beyond any wheat\r\nHiram Strong had ever seen. Whether it was of the bearded or smooth\r\nvariety, the grain from such a plant must make a heavy and paying\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nHe looked up suddenly to see Yancey Battick--his face inflamed and gun\r\nin hand--bearing down upon him with so savage a demeanor that Hiram\r\nconfessed himself frightened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                        YANCEY BATTICK'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing there?\" demanded Battick, with his gun cocked and\r\nthe muzzle on a level with Hiram Strong's breast. \"Have I got to give\r\nyou a lesson, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly are teaching me something, Mr. Battick,\" returned the\r\nyoung farmer with flushed face and angry look. \"Put down that gun! What\r\ndo you mean by threatening to shoot me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll more than threaten to do it!\" declared the man wildly. \"You get\r\naway from that wheat! You get off this farm! And you stay off!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with you, Mr. Battick?\" cried Hiram. \"Are you\r\ncrazy? You haven't got your farm posted over there where I entered.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't go to the expense of putting up a 'no trespass' sign every\r\nfew feet,\" snarled Battick. \"But you, as well as everybody else around\r\nhere, know that I don't want anybody sneaking around my place. Get\r\nout!\" and he advanced with the gun again.\r\n\r\nThe double muzzle of the shotgun was a most unpleasant prospect. Hiram\r\nStrong did not fancy being backed through the wood to the boundary\r\nfence with the gun against his breast. It was too ignominious a\r\nprospect to be borne.\r\n\r\nIt has always been a mooted question just how far a man may go to\r\nprotect his property from trespass. In most cases the courts demand\r\nthat harmful trespass be proved. And certainly Hiram had done no harm,\r\nand contemplated none, in coming here to look at his neighbor's wheat.\r\n\r\nHe did not believe Yancey Battick was altogether sane. But an insane\r\nman with a shotgun is a combination as uncertain as a barrel of\r\ngunpowder and a match!\r\n\r\nHiram half turned towards the woods path through which he had come.\r\nBattick, only eight feet or so away, raised the muzzle of his gun a\r\ntrifle. Like a flash the young fellow wheeled, stooped, and leaped in\r\nto seize the man.\r\n\r\nThe gun exploded and Hiram's hat went sailing into the air, its brim\r\nin front torn to bits. His forehead was blackened by the smoke of the\r\ndischarge, so near was it.\r\n\r\nBut he had seized Yancey Battick around the waist and held on. The\r\nshotgun fell to the ground under their stamping feet. The young farm\r\nmanager was more vigorous if not more angry than his antagonist. For\r\nhalf a minute or more they strained and tugged--Hiram to throw the man,\r\nthe latter to escape from his embrace.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they broke apart. Both staggered back a pace. They stared at\r\neach other, their visages pale now rather than inflamed. Both realized\r\nhow near to tragedy the incident had led.\r\n\r\nHiram drew a palm across his blackened and sweating forehead. Battick\r\nstill glared, panting, at the young fellow.\r\n\r\n\"I--I might have shot you, Strong. You're a young fool,\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"If anybody lacks sense it is you,\" retorted Hiram quickly. \"If you had\r\nkilled me I'd only have been dead. But you would have had to pay the\r\npenalty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are on my land--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't begin that old foolishness,\" commanded Hiram.\r\n\r\nHe seized the man's arm and led him toward a log at the edge of the\r\nwood. Battick was actually shaking and he stared at Hiram in a way\r\nthat troubled the latter considerably. Could it be that this strange\r\nindividual was really insane?\r\n\r\n\"Sit down here,\" said the youth, and took a seat beside him on the log.\r\n\"Now for goodness sake, tell me what the matter is with you. I know you\r\nhave bred a new wheat. I saw the grain at your house. I suppose this\r\nis a field of it. Why act like a madman about it? I can't steal these\r\nplants and so breed the wheat in competition.\"\r\n\r\nBattick looked at him solemnly. \"You don't know what I have been\r\nthrough, Mr. Strong,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I can see you are carrying on a regular guerrilla warfare against your\r\nneighbors, Mr. Battick. But I cannot imagine why.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have hounded me--robbed me!\" exclaimed Battick excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"Who have?\"\r\n\r\n\"People you don't know, perhaps. And perhaps you do! I can never be\r\nsure that their agents are not around here. You may be one of them, Mr.\r\nStrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Or you may be as right as rain. I was too quick just now. But I am\r\nsuspicious of every person I see trespassing in my fields.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who could, or would, do this wheat harm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you! When I bred my Mortgage Lifter Oats I was robbed of\r\nmy seed, my standing grain was burned just before it was ready for the\r\nsickle, and cattle were turned in on my young oats, a field like this,\r\nand allowed to graze.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Mortgage Lifter Oats? The great new oat that Bonsall and Burgess,\r\nthe seedsmen in Chicago, put out four years ago and which proved such a\r\nwonderful cropper?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bred that variety, Mr. Battick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But I do not get the credit for it, nor did I get any of the\r\nmoney--a small fortune--that has been made through its sale. I do not\r\nhold Bonsall and Burgess at fault. They honestly bought the new seed of\r\nthose who robbed me and were themselves aware of no crime having been\r\ncommitted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Strong. There are mighty mean people in this world. Where I\r\nlived before I came to this place there were other men living around me\r\nwho gave some attention to the selection and breeding of new varieties\r\nof seed. You see, that clergyman who years ago made a clear twenty\r\nthousand dollars by breeding a famous muskmelon started us all to\r\nhunting for new types of vegetables, fruits, and grains.\r\n\r\n\"Rivalries arose in my neighborhood, of course. But I thought they\r\nwere friendly rivalries. We even talked over our discoveries at the\r\nGrange meetings. I had made a study of plant life, and I gave little\r\nlectures--the more fool me!--to the boys and girls who were interested\r\nenough to come together at the schoolhouse to listen. I had no idea my\r\nneighbors would steal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say they did?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. And some of the very boys I had tried to interest and help\r\nwere the ones who broke down my fence and turned the cattle into my\r\nyoung oats. That was so I should be unable to raise a crop of the new\r\noats that year and so fail to take advantage of the Mortgage Lifter\r\nbeing advertised by the seedsmen. You understand that all big money is\r\nmade on new seeds in the first and second seasons, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that, Mr. Battick,\" Hiram agreed. \"After that everybody has the\r\nnew strain. It must be a quick clean-up in the seed business.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it. I don't really know to this day just who it was profited by\r\nmy loss. In the main, I mean. Almost everybody around my place had some\r\nof the seed. That held the gang together and made it impossible for me\r\nto get any evidence against the real transgressors. You see, the other\r\nneighbors were bribed.\r\n\r\n\"However, my crops had been destroyed, the seed-oats taken out of my\r\ngranary in the night when I was ill. It was a dirty plot! Bonsall and\r\nBurgess were not to be blamed. Nor could they tell me anything. They\r\nwere bound to secrecy in their contract.\"\r\n\r\n\"And could you get no satisfaction?\" asked Hiram, in sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"I could prove nothing. You cannot patent, or copyright, a seed! Those\r\nfellows merely beat me to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a shame!\"\r\n\r\nBattick laughed bitterly. \"They certainly did me dirt,\" he said. \"I\r\nsold out and came here. I may be wrong in telling you this. Nobody else\r\nknows what I came here for and why I bought the old Pringle place.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Hiram smiling. \"Some of the neighbors assume you came here\r\nto practice the black art.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them! The less they know the better for me. I've chased more of\r\nthem than you think off the place. That lazy, good-for-nothing Adam\r\nBanks--\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that he has troubled you?\" put in Hiram, with some\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And I'll surely fill his pants full of rock salt so that he'll\r\nprefer eating off the mantel-shelf for a week, if he doesn't keep away.\r\nI don't trust anybody, Mr. Strong, and that's a fact. Unless it is you.\r\nI believe I have the finest strain of wheat that was ever bred.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped. It was plain that he could not trust Hiram sufficiently to\r\ntalk intimately about it. He shook his head and looked away.\r\n\r\nHiram glanced at him, scrutinizing the worn, hoop-backed figure from\r\nthe corner of his eye. Yancey Battick was not an old man. He was worse\r\nthan that. He was a man worn out before his time.\r\n\r\nThe young farm manager could understand just how hope and faith had\r\ndried up in this unfortunate man and left only a husk. Fate and unkind\r\ncircumstances, as well as wicked men, had sadly treated Yancey Battick.\r\n\r\nHis best efforts had gone for nothing. His attempts to win a competence\r\nfor his old age had been frustrated. Perhaps there were more personal\r\nsorrows--heart-breaking sorrows--in Yancey Battick's life that he had\r\nnot touched upon in his angry and bitter narrative.\r\n\r\nHiram's own heart warmed toward him, unlovely as he was physically. If\r\nhe could help Yancey Battick he was determined to do so.\r\n\r\n\"I am mighty sorry for your bad luck, Mr. Battick,\" Hiram said, rising\r\nat last from his seat on the log. \"I really did not intend annoying you\r\nwhen I came over here to look at your wheat. It looked so much better\r\nthan that on Sunnyside that I was curious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Un-huh,\" muttered Battick. \"I understand you, Mr. Strong. I presume\r\nyou are all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-day!\" said Hiram, moving off. \"I'll be sure to come around\r\nto the front door again if I visit you,\" and he laughed shortly.\r\n\r\nThe laugh died on his lips as he went back through the woods path. And\r\nfor a very strange reason. Through the greenery to the right he caught\r\nsudden sight of a figure slinking away from behind the log on which he\r\nand Battick had been sitting while the latter told his story.\r\n\r\nHiram recognized this eavesdropper. It was Adam Banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                           THE COUNTRY DANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Delia Pringle had an idea and she came to Hiram with it that very\r\nday when he returned from his visit to Yancey Battick's patch of wheat.\r\n\r\n\"I do love a dance, Mr. Strong, don't you?\" she began with her head on\r\none side and a languishing look. \"We have had very few of them around\r\nthis neighborhood this winter. The flu, you know--so many unfortunate\r\nsicknesses.\r\n\r\n\"But the winter's well over now and everybody who hasn't died of the\r\nflu has recovered. I'd dearly love to have one more dance before haying\r\nand grain harvest--before all the young men get too busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I want your help in getting it up, Mr. Strong,\" Miss Pringle\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Miss Pringle,\" he said rather anxiously, \"I'm a newcomer. I don't\r\nwant to put myself forward and act officiously. It might make a bad\r\nimpression on the minds of the neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense!\" cried the lively spinster. \"They all like you--of\r\ncourse they do!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Adam Banks,\" suggested Hiram, with one of his quick smiles that\r\nalways made his rather plain face more attractive.\r\n\r\n\"My goodness! I should hope not,\" exclaimed Miss Pringle. \"If he did I\r\ncertainly wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I think Terry Crane is getting to dislike me, too,\" added Hiram\r\nspeaking of the man whom he had put into the burned-over patch of\r\nwoodland to chop down trees. \"I understand that Crane's wife thinks I'm\r\nquite a terrible fellow because I make her washing so hard.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Pringle laughed. \"It would be a good thing, I should think, if\r\nthese folks got together and learned more about you, Mr. Strong--got\r\nreally to know you and how nice you are,\" and her smile would--when he\r\nfirst knew her--have made Hiram blush to the very tips of his ears.\r\n\r\n\"You flatter me, Miss Pringle,\" was what he said. \"And I don't believe\r\nI would know how to go about getting up a dance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all right. You leave that to me,\" she said promptly. \"What\r\nI want of you, Mr. Strong, is to get Mr. Bronson to let us dance on his\r\nfloor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dance on his floor?\" repeated Hiram. \"At Plympton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, then? What floor? His barn floor here at Sunnyside?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! Of his new house. Don't you know how Dolan and MacComb are\r\ngoing to put up the house after your silo is done? They often build 'em\r\nso around here. They do not raise the whole frame at once, but lay the\r\nfloor on the sills and then put up the scantlings for the frame, story\r\nby story--the outside walls first.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. That is a common practice in some localities.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is here,\" returned Miss Pringle, \"for we have a good many high\r\nwinds. Come along one of those baby tornadoes, as they call 'em, and\r\na regular house-frame would be torn all to pieces, unless it was well\r\nboarded in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well. If it's nice weather, as it is likely to be in June when the\r\nfloor's laid, we always try to have a dance. Christen the floor, as\r\nit were. In this Pringleton district we don't get to have a real good\r\ndance once in a dog's age. Carpet dances are nothing, and barn floors\r\nare so rough. So's the schoolhouse floor. There isn't a real hall\r\nnearer than Plympton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see your idea, Miss Pringle,\" Hiram said; \"and if I can get Mr.\r\nBronson to agree--and I presume he will--I don't see why we shouldn't\r\nhave a nice time. Miss Bronson will be home early in June, and I\r\nshouldn't wonder but that she would help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Little Lettie Bronson? Of course she will. We'll have a regular\r\nparty,\" declared the enthusiastic Delia. \"And I hope you'll ask me to\r\ndance, Mr. Strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise to,\" laughed Hiram. \"I ask you right now for at least two\r\ndances, and there's Orrin. I bet he can dance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've already promised him three, Mr. Strong,\" declared the\r\nfore-thoughtful spinster, in high fettle.\r\n\r\nThis was a bit of pleasure to look forward to; and all work and no play\r\ndoes make Jack a dull boy. It was something to write Sister about, too;\r\nand Sister (who wrote more frequently now that she had discovered Hiram\r\nwould answer her letters) became very much interested in \"Hiram's house\r\nraising party,\" as Mother Atterson called it.\r\n\r\n    \"Mrs. Atterson remembers going to a barn raising party when she was\r\n    a girl in the country and there she met Mr. Atterson for the first\r\n    time,\" Sister wrote in her very next letter. \"She thinks she never\r\n    had such a nice time as she did at that party. I wish I was going\r\n    to be at your house raising party, Hiram.\r\n\r\n    \"Miss Lettie Bronson has been here and says she expects to be\r\n    home for the party. She says Miss Pringle--the lady you write so\r\n    much about--has writ (is that right, Hiram? Mrs. Atterson says it\r\n    is) her all about it and how fine you are getting along with your\r\n    spring work. I would dearly love to see you riding your double-disc\r\n    plow behind those Percherons. They must be as big as elephants.\r\n\r\n    \"I am most of all interested in that Orrin Post. To think of his\r\n    coming to your place sick, and all, and then turning out to be\r\n    such a nice fellow and such good help! Mrs. Atterson says it was a\r\n    leading. You were led to go down into the calf shed that night to\r\n    find the poor fellow.\"\r\n\r\nThere was considerable more to the letter for Sister was a voluminous\r\nwriter when once she got started. Hiram's epistles, however, had soon\r\nto be of the briefest description, for the work was piling up on him\r\nenormously. Spring had opened with a bang!\r\n\r\nHad it not been for Orrin Post the young farm manager would actually\r\nhave been swamped with the details of the farmwork. As he gained\r\nstrength (and Orrin did that rapidly) he relieved Hiram of many petty\r\nduties that had begun greatly to try the latter.\r\n\r\nHelpful and pleasant as Orrin Post always was, he did not grow any more\r\ncommunicative about himself as their intimacy increased. His past was\r\na sealed book to everybody about Sunnyside. Even Miss Delia Pringle\r\nconfessed to the young farm manager that she had never met such a\r\nclose-mouthed person.\r\n\r\n\"A dentist's forceps wouldn't pull anything out of that Post--no more\r\nthan as though he was a post,\" she declared. \"But he is a mighty nice\r\nfellow.\"\r\n\r\nThe workmen at Sunnyside and the other neighbors had at first referred\r\nto the stranger as \"that tramp,\" but after a time they warmed up to\r\nOrrin. He was friendly, and was always willing to bear a hand at any\r\njob.\r\n\r\nThe ditching was completed and the logs laid in the drains and\r\ncovered. Miss Pringle's burned-over patch was certainly improved in\r\nappearance. The sprouts and bushes were growing rapidly green and would\r\nsoon completely hide the unsightly stumps. Even the most critical\r\nneighbors owned to the improvement. But some of them carped at Hiram's\r\nunderdraining scheme. That twenty acres never had amounted to much and\r\nit never would, according to these people.\r\n\r\n\"Digging the drains was all right, Mr. Strong,\" said Turner, who held\r\nthe farm back of Miss Pringle's. \"That is, the ditches would have been\r\nall right, except they'd have been in the way of plowing and tilling.\r\n\r\n\"But when you threw in the logs and covered them up you did a fool's\r\ntrick, if you'll allow me, who was farming, it's likely, when your\r\ndaddy was born, to say so. A fool trick--yes, sir!\"\r\n\r\nBut Hiram only laughed pleasantly at the grizzled old farmer's\r\ncriticism, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say I believe you are right and I am wrong, Mr. Turner; but\r\nthere is one thing that will settle the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that, young man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Time,\" replied Hiram, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! I guess that is so,\" agreed the aged farmer. \"Maybe you ain't so\r\nbig a fool as you appear.\"\r\n\r\nCriticism did not bother Hiram Strong, and as he told Mr. Turner he\r\ncould afford to wait for time to prove him right. He knew that even the\r\nowner of Sunnyside Farm, Mr. Bronson, felt some doubt regarding the\r\nvalue of the kind of underdraining his young farm manager had done. And\r\nit had cost a pretty penny!\r\n\r\nBut now came the plowing for corn and Hiram had four weeks of steady\r\nplowing and raking to get the fallow land into shape for his corn crop.\r\nAnd he did most of the plowing with the Percherons and the double-disc\r\nplow himself. There being little culch on the land, this make of plow\r\nworked remarkably well.\r\n\r\nThis land on which he proposed to grow his main crop was limed heavily\r\nbefore it was raked, and he determined to fertilize well with a\r\nspecial corn fertilizer at planting time. Mr. Bronson mixed his own\r\nfertilizers. Early in the season Hiram had secured specimens of the\r\nsoil on which he was to plant the corn, and had sent them to the State\r\nAgricultural College for examination.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he expected his employer to supply him with a chemical\r\ncompound which would have in it just the needed ingredients to\r\nfertilize the soil in question for the growth of corn. But he knew\r\nthese acres of Sunnyside had already been heavily cropped; and in\r\nspite of their having lain fallow for a year he did not look for any\r\nbig crop. The long-tenanted farm was hungry for humus--something the\r\nchemicals could not put into it.\r\n\r\n\"But at the last cultivation of the corn,\" he told Mr. Bronson, \"we\r\nwill sow crimson clover. Well limed as the land now is, we should get a\r\ngood catch of clover. We'll cut it for hay in June--and cut it at the\r\nright time. I shouldn't want it to ball up in the stomachs of these\r\nsplendid Percherons, for instance, and kill them, as many a good horse\r\nhas been killed by crimson clover.\"\r\n\r\n\"We usually plant wheat and clover together for hay,\" Mr. Bronson said.\r\n\"I have had an unfortunate experience with crimson clover cut at the\r\nwrong time.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father showed me the time to cut and cure it. It is safe as a\r\nchurch if handled right,\" declared Hiram vigorously. \"But it should not\r\nbe fed steadily without other hay. It would be like trying to bring up\r\na child on sugar only. The youngster would like it all right--until he\r\nwas made sick. So with the horses.\r\n\r\n\"Now, we ought to get a good crop of hay off this corn land by June\r\nof next year. Then if we can broadcast the sod with compost or cattle\r\nmanure we shall have an ideal soil for corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, I say! you're figuring on following corn with corn and only\r\nclover between,\" exclaimed the farm owner.\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough. And with the broadcasting of manure and a good, sharp\r\nfertilizer in the drill, I guarantee to make a fifty per cent. better\r\ncrop on this same land next year than I can this, although next year's\r\ncrop will have to be planted a month later than this, and I shall have\r\nto have help in the plowing.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right! All right! Go ahead, Hiram,\" cried Mr. Bronson, literally\r\nthrowing up his hands. \"You are the most convincing talker for a young\r\nchap that I ever heard. But on my other farms I usually plant potatoes\r\non clover sod.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the old and standard rotation of crops--corn, clover, potatoes.\r\nBut Sunnyside is not potato raising soil. Nor are the marketing\r\nconditions right for going in heavily for such a crop. To make money\r\nhere I thought we had agreed, Mr. Bronson, that nothing should be sold\r\noff Sunnyside save what can walk, outside of the wheat and corn?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. We did. And you are correct, my boy. But the old Irish\r\nCobbler has made me so much money on my lower land around Plympton,\r\non a three crop rotation, that I cannot get it out of my mind that it\r\nought to work up here.\"\r\n\r\n\"On Sunnyside we've got to raise corn, we've got to raise silage, and a\r\npart of the land should be excellent for grain if properly tilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear from Miss Pringle that for the last few years the wheat has not\r\nbeen much.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the crop now in the ground will not be much,\" grumbled Hiram. \"But\r\nbelieve me, Mr. Bronson, I won't put a grain of wheat in the ground\r\nnext September unless I am pretty positive of a thirty bushel crop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sh! Don't let any of these old hardshells around here hear you say\r\nthat or they'll think you are crazy. They don't average over twenty\r\nbushels to the acre, if they do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's one man around here who is going to do better than that unless\r\nall signs fail,\" said Hiram quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yancey Battick.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Why, that wet, sour land of his isn't fit to grow wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right; but wait a while. Maybe he'll show you something.\r\nThat is, barring the weather or the Hessian fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The weather we cannot control. We can only pray about that,\" said Mr.\r\nBronson smiling. \"But how about the Hessian fly and other insect pests?\"\r\n\r\n\"Luck. It's good luck if you don't have 'em and bad if you do,\"\r\nanswered Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything about this new one--what they call the English\r\nwheat louse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that he's 'bad medicine,'\" Hiram replied. \"But I do have faith in\r\none thing to help overcome the ravages of all pests on wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The use of a fertilizer in which nitrate of soda is prominent. The\r\nnitrate forces the growth and sometimes that puts the crop ahead of the\r\nfly or other vermin. There is not much fast-growing wheat on Sunnyside\r\nto-day, Mr. Bronson. Here it is corn-planting time and the wheat is not\r\nyet two feet high.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen richer land, Hiram,\" rejoined the farm owner. \"But I don't\r\nexpect to see much richer around here than Sunnyside will have after\r\na couple of years of your work. I'll supply the money, my boy, if you\r\nwill supply the brains.\"\r\n\r\n\"That swells me all up, Mr. Bronson,\" laughed Hiram, \"But I never did\r\nclaim that all the farm knowledge in the world is under my cap.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one man or boy ever had too much of that, I can assure you,\" Mr.\r\nBronson agreed. \"But you must feel your responsibility. If Sunnyside\r\nis going to be a well tilled and profitable farm, it will come through\r\nyour personal effort, more than by any other way, Hiram.\"\r\n\r\nHiram Strong felt all this. He had taken a big contract on his\r\nshoulders, and he did not overlook that fact for a single waking hour.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson sent another corn planter from one of his other farms and\r\nthe two teams cleaned up the Sunnyside corn patch in a week. It was the\r\nbiggest acreage of corn Hiram had ever had anything to do with, and\r\nhe looked over the great brown field from the altitude of the knoll\r\non which the new farmhouse was being built with no little pride and\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The two teams cleaned up the Sunnyside cornpatch in a\r\nweek.]\r\n\r\nMiss Delia Pringle had proved a true prophetess. The silo was finished,\r\nall but two of the hoops and the wire stays, and the carpenters were\r\nwell at work on the new house. The lower floor was laid and the\r\nframework for the outer walls raised as high as the second story, and\r\nthe back and sides were boarded in.\r\n\r\nLettie Bronson arrived home on the eighth of June, and it was the\r\nevening of that day that had been set for the \"house raising dance\" at\r\nSunnyside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                      TROUBLE WITH TURNER'S BULL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hard scrubby looking red and yellow corn that Hiram had got from\r\nMr. Brown and tested so carefully, had planted a goodly patch of the\r\nSunnyside cornland. Mr. Bronson looked at some of it as Hiram filled\r\nthe two cylinders of the cornplanter, running several handfuls through\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\"That's kind of scrubby looking stuff, Hiram,\" he observed doubtfully.\r\n\"I sent you up better looking seed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Your seed certainly is well selected and graded,\" agreed the\r\nyouth. \"But I am not going to plant it on this lowland; not much of it,\r\nanyway. That big corn grows tall, I imagine, and takes plenty of time\r\nto grow, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"From a hundred and ten to a hundred and twenty days. But you are\r\nplanting plenty early.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Only we may get frost on this lowland early in September. The\r\nfarmers about here tell me they do, some years. And June frosts, too,\r\nonce in a bad while. I am afraid, if we had a set-back in corn planting\r\nin June, that long-growing variety of yours would get scarcely glazed\r\ndown here, before the September frost hit it. And it is not the sort of\r\ncorn I want for silage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. You always do have an answer ready, Hiram; and usually it's\r\na good one. Though, truth to tell, an early September frost here is\r\nalmost as unlikely as a July snow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the same,\" his young employee said, \"this corn that you think is\r\nso scrubby is due to make you a big crop. I am planting a specially\r\nprepared strip on that far side toward Battick's for seed.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it isn't even pure breed, Hiram. There will be a dozen red ears to\r\nthe bushel, I am certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see a horse or a mule refuse a red ear of corn?\"\r\nlaughed Hiram. \"I don't ever remember of seeing smut on an ear that\r\nturned out to be red--though that doesn't prove anything. And red ears\r\nmake just as good meal as yellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you are right. But this looks like scrub.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it comes right, when it is cured you can knock a steer down with\r\nan ear of it without knocking a kernel off the cob.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be some corn, boy!\" chuckled Mr. Bronson.\r\n\r\nHiram came up from the first raking of this seed corn patch at noontime\r\nof this beautiful June day to find Miss Pringle and some of the younger\r\ngirls transforming the first floor of the new house at Sunnyside into\r\na ballroom. Busy as they were at this time on the farm, both Hiram and\r\nOrrin gave the girls a helping hand during the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe carpenters built a small platform at the back of the house for the\r\nmusicians. There was to be the piano brought over from Miss Pringle's,\r\na violin, and a horn. Mr. Bronson had sent up a lot of Japanese\r\nlanterns, and these the boys strung as they were directed about the\r\nbig, open floor and overhead. Chairs and benches were brought from the\r\nschoolhouse, half a mile or more away.\r\n\r\nThe veranda flooring had likewise been laid, and the carpenters had\r\nbuilt wide, rough steps by which the veranda could easily be reached.\r\n\r\nThe girls swept out all the shavings and other litter, and the\r\nwell-laid floor presented an attractive appearance to the eye of\r\nanybody who was fond of dancing. Just as the place was pronounced\r\nready by Delia Pringle, and the girls and boys were retiring from the\r\ncleanly swept floor, Adam Banks appeared at the back door and coolly\r\nscrambled into the house.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see how it is laid,\" he said, grinning, and beginning to clog\r\nclumsily with his heavy boots.\r\n\r\nHe had been walking in muddy places, and every step he took on the\r\nclean boards rattled gravel and mud off his boots.\r\n\r\n\"You get out of here, Ad Banks,\" commanded Miss Pringle, starting after\r\nhim with broom and dust pan. \"You are the biggest nuisance that ever\r\nwas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw, Delia, don't be harsh with a fellow,\" said Banks, grinning\r\nbroadly. \"You going to promise me a dance to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you probably coming here half drunk!\" announced the spinster,\r\nfrankly. \"I guess not!\" announced the spinster, frankly. \"I guess not!\r\nNo indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better. You'll be a wall-flower enough, Delia--you know you\r\nwill.\"\r\n\r\nAt that Miss Pringle flushed very red and her eyes fairly snapped.\r\n\r\n\"If I never danced at all I wouldn't take on any such makeshift of a\r\nman as you, Ad Banks! Get out of here!\" she commanded, \"shooing\" him\r\nwith the broom.\r\n\r\nHe grappled with her, still laughing in his lubberly way, and wrenched\r\nthe broom from Miss Pringle's hands.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Delia,\" he sing-songed, \"how I love you! You're the prettiest\r\ngirl I know. Come on and give us a dance. No? Then I'll dance with the\r\nbroom,\" and he proceeded to do a grotesque dance over the clean floor\r\nwith the broomstick for a partner.\r\n\r\n\"Now just look at what you've done, Ad Banks!\" cried Miss Pringle\r\nalmost in tears. \"See that!\"\r\n\r\nBroken cakes of mud were scattered about the floor wherever the fellow\r\nclogged while Miss Pringle looked on angrily.\r\n\r\n\"That fellow needs a good licking,\" Orrin Post said to Hiram, while the\r\ngirls loudly expressed their vexation at what Banks was doing.\r\n\r\nHiram had quite made up his mind not to begin any personal violence\r\nwith Adam Banks. The man had time and again sought to coax the young\r\nfarm manager into a fight.\r\n\r\nBanks was half a head taller than Hiram and much bulkier in appearance.\r\nHe could easily have overcome Orrin, who was slight and still suffering\r\nfrom the effects of the attack of measles.\r\n\r\nBut when Orrin leaped back upon the veranda and started to enter\r\nthe house, Hiram could not allow the matter to go farther without\r\ninterference. He would not see Orrin attack a man plainly so much\r\nstronger than himself.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" the young farm manager commanded. \"You stay out of this,\"\r\nand he caught the angry Orrin by the arm. \"If anybody is going to make\r\nAdam Banks walk French, it has to be me. Really, nobody else has a\r\nright to throw him out, I presume, as I am the representative of the\r\nowner of the farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up and do something, then,\" growled Orrin. \"I'm not going to\r\nstand around and see Delia abused.\"\r\n\r\nHiram pushed ahead of his friend, and as Banks, still dodging and\r\nlaughing at Miss Pringle, gyrated nearer, Hiram stepped quickly\r\nforward and seized him by his shirt collar and the waistband of his\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\n\"Hi! Hey!\" bawled Banks. \"What are you trying to do?\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped the broom. He struggled mightily to break away. But all he\r\ncould do was to kick and paw the air.\r\n\r\nHiram had him right on the tips of his toes, and propelled him across\r\nthe floor in a most undignified way and at great speed. Doubtless the\r\nyoung fellow's success arose from the unexpectedness of his attack; but\r\nHiram was likewise very strong.\r\n\r\nHe shot Banks out of the front door of the new house, across the\r\nveranda and down the steps, and thence across the front yard to the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go! I'll kill you for this, Hi Strong!\" Banks shouted.\r\n\r\nHiram made no verbal reply to this threat, but to the delight and with\r\nthe applause of the girls he flung Adam Banks from him with such force\r\nthat the fellow sprawled on hands and knees in the dust.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" Hiram said. \"I am sorry that I was obliged to do it; but I\r\n_have_ had to and so the matter is settled. Mr. Bronson told me to put\r\nyou off the place and keep you off. I've done part of my duty--I've\r\nthrown you off of Sunnyside. I'll do the rest of it just so sure as you\r\ncome loitering around here--I'll keep you off.\"\r\n\r\n\"You blamed fool!\" sputtered Banks, \"don't you dare touch me again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You step back on to the farm and see how quick I'll touch you.\"\r\n\r\nBanks, after so emphatic an exhibition of Hiram's ability to handle\r\nhim, took it out in sputtering. He did not come back. But he threatened\r\ndire vengeance as he stumbled away. The girls and the carpenters\r\nworking within sight approved of Hiram's exploit--so much so, indeed,\r\nthat the young fellow was glad to get out of the way for a while after\r\nBanks had gone, and so escape their congratulations.\r\n\r\nBut after supper at six-thirty in the workmen's shack, Hiram Strong\r\nwas obliged to appear in front of the new house and meet people. What\r\nhe had done to Adam Banks, the neighborhood bully, seemed to have been\r\ncirculated by some method of grapevine telegraph, and Hiram realized\r\nthat those who did not speak to him about it showed that they had heard\r\nthe story by their curious smiles.\r\n\r\nHe was a newcomer, and naturally his neighbors were sizing him up. The\r\nyoung farmer from the East expected they would be curious about him if\r\nnot actually doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe thing that soon began to make the deepest impression on the young\r\nmanager of Sunnyside was the number of automobiles that were arriving.\r\nThere were some horse-drawn buggies and carriages, but one after\r\nanother the more popular makes of motor-cars arrived at the farm until\r\nthere were more than fifty parked along the roadside.\r\n\r\nThe Bronson car came after the dancing had begun. Hiram ran out to\r\ngreet his employer and Lettie. The latter was dressed in the very\r\nheight of city fashion and when she came up to the dancing floor on\r\nHiram's arm the country girls fairly buzzed.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of Lettie's _outré_ style in dress, she was by no means\r\nsnobbish. She greeted everybody whom she knew with perfect freedom,\r\nand she displayed no air of patronage. Hiram thought to himself that\r\nLettie Bronson had greatly improved during these past few months.\r\n\r\nMiss Pringle, who had already danced once with Hiram and once with\r\nOrrin, ran over to meet the daughter of the owner of Sunnyside Farm,\r\nand her effusive greeting only made Lettie laugh.\r\n\r\n\"There is a whole flock of fellows here who will want to dance with\r\nyou, Lettie Bronson,\" the young-old girl declared. \"You'll have a good\r\ntime here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course she will,\" said her escort, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Hiram, first,\" declared Lettie, smiling up at her father's employee in\r\na way to make the young fellow's heart increase its beat. \"I haven't\r\ndanced with him since we had our barn dance last corn husking at\r\nScoville. Remember, Hiram?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say I do,\" he agreed with warmth.\r\n\r\n\"And then I want to know Orrin Post. Does he dance, Hiram?\"\r\n\r\n\"There he is now dancing with Miss Paulsen,\" said Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Of course Orrin can dance,\" Miss Pringle joined in.\r\n\r\n\"You know Sister--or is it Cecilia?--is very much interested in this\r\nOrrin Post, too,\" Lettie said to Hiram as they got into step with the\r\nmusic. \"I saw her and dear old Mrs. Atterson just the other day. You\r\nwill have to make good here at Sunnyside, Hiram Strong, or you will\r\ndisappoint Sister and Mrs. Atterson fearfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean to succeed. I hope all my friends will root for me from the\r\nside lines,\" laughed Hiram, yet with a certain wistful glance at his\r\npartner.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we will,\" cried Lettie frankly. \"And nobody will root any\r\nlouder than 'yours truly,' Hiram. Why! next to father I am sure nobody\r\ncan have your welfare more at heart than I.\"\r\n\r\nLettie said this with her very best grown-up air. But it pleased Hiram\r\na great deal. His interest in his employer's daughter was very deep and\r\nvery serious. Lettie Bronson was the most interesting girl he had ever\r\nmet.\r\n\r\nThe dancing floor was now well filled every time the orchestra\r\nplayed, and the chairs and settees around the edge of the floor were\r\ncrowded. It was a lively scene, and the lanterns furnished all the\r\nlight necessary. At the openings for the windows that were not yet, of\r\ncourse, framed in, men and boys who did not dance stood and talked or\r\nsmoked.\r\n\r\nThe crowd increased both on the floor and outside the new house. Now\r\nand then Hiram went out to see what was going on. There was some\r\nshouting and ribald laughter at a distance, but the rowdy element\r\nseemed to keep away from the vicinity of the dance.\r\n\r\n\"I hear you finally took my advice about Ad Banks,\" Mr. Bronson said to\r\nHiram, chuckling, \"and ran him off the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Folks are making too much of it,\" the young fellow replied. \"Hullo!\r\nWhat is this coming?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a wood road through the burned-over patch belonging to Miss\r\nPringle, and there was light enough from the moon and stars to show\r\nHiram and those who stood with him on the front porch of the new house\r\na crowd of men and boys approaching along this rough way.\r\n\r\n\"There's Ad Banks now!\" exclaimed one man. \"You are going to have\r\ntrouble with him, Bronson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not me,\" declared the farm owner. \"It's all in Hiram's hands, and I\r\nhave confidence that he can handle anything Banks can start.\"\r\n\r\nHiram had already started for the road. A sharp cry arose in front:\r\n\r\n\"Look out, there! That bull is as mad as he can be. Look out!\"\r\n\r\nA huge, plunging shape came out of the wood path with two men, or boys,\r\nhanging on to the ropes hitched to the monster. The latter headed\r\nright across the road and those in the way scattered like chaff before\r\na wind.\r\n\r\n\"That's Turner's bull!\" shouted somebody behind Hiram. \"He is as savage\r\nas a lion.\"\r\n\r\nAt that the two men clinging to the maddened animal let go of the\r\nropes. With head down, and uttering a reverberating bellow, the\r\ncreature came toward the new house on the floor of which the girls and\r\nboys were dancing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                             WHEAT HARVEST\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been two powerful lamps lifted from automobiles and placed so\r\nthat they would light the veranda. Therefore the front of the partially\r\nbuilt house and the yard were well illuminated.\r\n\r\nAs the bull charged through the gap in the fence his coming cleared the\r\nyard in a hurry. The only person who stood his ground was Hiram, and he\r\ndid not do so from any choice of his own.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the mad bull was aiming directly for the steps to the\r\nveranda, and the young farm manager stood directly in his path. The\r\nyouth was not fear-paralyzed, but his mind was quite as empty of ideas\r\nat the moment as the others who had run in all directions. His single\r\nthought was:\r\n\r\n\"If I only had a club!\"\r\n\r\nHiram Strong had not overpowering fear of this, or any other, bull. He\r\nquite realized the danger threatening whoever stood in the way of the\r\nbeast. But he had dodged more than one animal of the kind, and with a\r\nhardwood stick in his hand he would not have been panic-stricken at\r\nthis meeting. The nose of a bull is a very tender spot.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I only had a club,\" the young farmer repeated to himself.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram had no club, and he saw no other weapon within his reach. As\r\nTurner's bull charged across the yard directly at him, Hiram skipped\r\nbackward until he reached the steps, and up those he stumbled.\r\n\r\nThe figure of the young fellow--the only living thing in his\r\npath--evidently held the bull's attention. He came on after Hiram,\r\nuttering another bellow.\r\n\r\nWithin those few seconds the excitement outside the new house was\r\ncommunicated to those inside. The music stopped suddenly; the girls\r\nbegan to scream. And when the boys at the bay windows began to shout\r\nthat Turner's bull was loose a good many of the dancers and spectators\r\nacted as though the beast was already upon the dancing floor.\r\n\r\nAnd it actually did seem as though the animal had that very intention\r\nof entering the partly finished house. Hiram had no more than leaped up\r\nthe steps than the bull plunged clatteringly after him.\r\n\r\nHad there been a bit of plank or a piece of scantling lying about,\r\nthe young fellow might have beaten the bull back. But the girls that\r\nafternoon had cleaned up the rubbish all too thoroughly.\r\n\r\nHiram flashed a single glance behind him. Within the wide opening left\r\nfor the front door he caught a glimpse of the startled faces of both\r\nLettie Bronson and Miss Pringle. They were both screaming some advice\r\nto him; but what it was they said Hiram did not know. The general\r\nhullabaloo drowning their cries. The excitement was growing.\r\n\r\nBut here, through a gap in the front wall, darted another person. It\r\nwas Orrin Post bringing with him a cape belonging to one of the dancers\r\nthat he had caught up and which floated behind him like the cape of a\r\nmatador.\r\n\r\nThe flying garment doubtless caught the eye of the enraged bull. He\r\nbellowed again and again and stopped to paw the boards of the veranda\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nHis hesitation was his undoing. Orrin rushed right in between Hiram and\r\nthe bull and flung the cape over the bull's head. Quickly Hiram leaped\r\nforward to help, and between them he and Orrin wound the cape about the\r\nanimal's head so that it could not shake off the all-smothering folds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Orrin ... flung the cape over the bull's head.]\r\n\r\n\"We got him!\" shouted Orrin, in high delight. \"All right, Strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Hiram. \"Grab that rope. Here's one on this side. They\r\nare hitched to his horns. Whoever those fellows were, they had no need\r\nto let the beast go.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was Banks and his friends. They did it purposely, you can just bet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of that.\"\r\n\r\nAll the ferocity of the bull seemed to have evaporated. They backed him\r\noff the veranda while the girls and boys returned with much excitement\r\nand noise. The bull, half smothered in the folds of the cape, uttered a\r\nrather plaintive \"moo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear that creature, will you?\" cried Miss Pringle's strident voice.\r\nThen, with increased excitement: \"What have you got his head wrapped\r\nin, I want to know? For the land's sake if it isn't my best broadcloth\r\ncape! Now what do you folks know about that!\"\r\n\r\nThe laugh that rose after this excited statement by the spinster\r\nrelieved the situation to some degree. But it did not pacify Hiram\r\nStrong's anger.\r\n\r\n\"I wish with all my heart I had trounced that Banks fellow this\r\nafternoon when I had the chance,\" he declared to Orrin.\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you. Nothing but a blamed good licking will ever do a\r\nfellow like him any good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to do him good,\" grumbled Hiram. \"I just want to pound\r\nhim and make him suffer.\"\r\n\r\nBut they were not likely to see Adam Banks again just then, or have a\r\nchance to beat him properly. Having encouraged younger boys to help\r\nlead Turner's bull from the pasture to Sunnyside and turn him loose,\r\nBanks had taken his own hasty departure.\r\n\r\nThen, evidently awakening to the enormity of his offence after he\r\nreached home, he packed a bag and departed from his father's house\r\nbefore daybreak and was not seen in the neighborhood again for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe excitement did not serve to spoil the house-raising dance, however,\r\nfor when the bull was led away the crowd returned to the dance floor,\r\nand the gaiety continued until long after midnight.\r\n\r\nHiram met most of the people worth knowing for a wide district\r\nsurrounding Sunnyside Farm, and he was glad to make their acquaintance\r\nin this friendly way. Most of all, however, did he enjoy the dance\r\nbecause of the presence of Lettie Bronson. She gave him several dances,\r\nand when he finally put her into the car beside her father Hiram\r\nsecretly felt that this evening was marked with a very agreeable\r\nmilestone in his career.\r\n\r\nThey next day opened a season of work even more strenuous than that\r\nwhich had gone before. The cultivating of the corn crop had to be\r\ncarried on every day now unless it rained. Mr. Bronson had furnished\r\nHiram a second small horse, and that, with Jerry, kept the cultivators\r\nand rake busy. The Percherons were too big and clumsy to use in the\r\ncornfield after the planting, and there was, too, plenty of other work\r\nfor them to do.\r\n\r\nSuch hay as there was on Sunnyside had to be harvested, and then came\r\nwheat harvest. Most of this crop--especially that on the twenty acre\r\npiece which had been underdrained--was rather thin. Sunnyside had not\r\ngrown heavy crops for years--if it ever had--and Hiram felt somewhat\r\ndoubtful about the final outcome of this attempt to make the old farm\r\nproductive when he saw how slim the wheat crop was.\r\n\r\nThey cut and stacked it, however, trusting that it would pay for\r\nthrashing later. Hiram went to the expense of removing the sheaves from\r\nthe field entirely and building the stacks on a lot near the barns.\r\nImmediately he put the Percherons to work plowing the twenty acres\r\nalong the county road.\r\n\r\nHe had no stable manure to broadcast here; yet he desired to help fill\r\nhis silo from this very piece of ground as well as to put the soil in\r\nbetter condition for winter wheat.\r\n\r\nThe Percherons certainly earned their keep that week. It was dry, with\r\nthe ground getting harder and more baked every day. Yet Hiram ploughed\r\nthe piece deep and raked it well before setting out to broadcast a good\r\ndressing of bone meal.\r\n\r\nTurner came along and stopped to watch Hiram, who was himself riding\r\nthe harrow which, in this case, pulverized the soil better than the\r\ndisc machine.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why it is,\" the aged farmer said, as Hiram stopped near\r\nthe road fence in a cloud of dust, \"but this soil fines up, seems to\r\nme, after such late plowing, better than I ever remember its doing\r\nbefore. Why do you suppose that is, Mr. Strong?\"\r\n\r\nHiram smiled across the fence at him: \"I never saw the piece plowed\r\nbefore, you know, Mr. Turner. I don't think much of it even now. But if\r\nthere has been any change in the condition of the soil I am inclined to\r\nlay it to that foolish job of underdraining I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! Nonsense! Couldn't be that!\" exclaimed the old fellow, driving\r\non. \"We ain't had no rain to amount to anything yet. When I see the\r\nwater pouring out o' those log drains of yours into the county ditch\r\nI'll take back all that I said about that foolishness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mighty hard work to convince some people they are wrong,\" chuckled\r\nHiram to himself, as he started the Percherons again. \"But it looks as\r\nif we would get enough rain pretty soon to prove one of us--either Mr.\r\nTurner or me--in the wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                           THE BABY TORNADO\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram had not lost sight of the fact that Yancey Battick's wheat had\r\npromised to be better than any of that planted on Sunnyside, to say the\r\nleast; and although since his rather serious experience with Battick\r\nand his gun he had barely nodded to the strange man in passing the old\r\nPringle homestead, Hiram had been very curious as to how Battick's crop\r\nwas coming on.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Bronson's binder was at Sunnyside Hiram offered Battick the\r\nuse of the machine.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I will drive it myself, so nobody else need know anything\r\nabout your crop,\" Hiram said.\r\n\r\n\"Very kind of you, Mr. Strong,\" said Battick, but in such a way that\r\nHiram was not at all sure whether the man was still suspicious or not.\r\n\"But I am going to reap that field with a sickle. I always do. This\r\nseed wheat is too precious to waste with a binder. I cradle it by hand\r\nand shall thrash it with a flail, too. That wheat which you happened\r\nto see in my house was harvested in the same way; and then it was all\r\nwinnowed and selected by hand, grain by grain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some job!\"\r\n\r\n\"But worth it if I can once get a sufficient quantity to interest a big\r\nseed house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume so,\" agreed Hiram. \"How does your wheat stand the dry\r\nweather?\"\r\n\r\n\"I take it you have not been over to see it of late?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can assure you I have not crossed the line fence since you showed\r\nme so plainly how you felt toward even innocent trespassers,\" Hiram\r\nrejoined stiffly.\r\n\r\nBattick gave him a sidewise glance and said nothing for a moment. He\r\nwas leaning, smoking his pipe, on his sagging front gate.\r\n\r\n\"Come on down to the field and take a look at my wheat, Mr. Strong,\"\r\nsaid the man at last, and only because Hiram saw that it was such an\r\nexertion for Yancey Battick to give the invitation did the youth accept.\r\n\r\nThey walked down past the old house, and Hiram saw that Battick had now\r\nmade plank shutters to all his lower windows which fitted flush with\r\nthe frames and were barred on the inside. He certainly had prepared to\r\nwithstand a siege!\r\n\r\nIt seemed silly. Surely the man's troubles must have turned his brain.\r\nYet when Hiram considered what Battick had suffered of wrong and\r\ndisappointment, he did not altogether blame him, sane or not.\r\n\r\n\"And this wheat is a wonder!\" the young farmer thought.\r\n\r\nHe said it aloud when he came in sight of the field in question. It was\r\nnot more than an acre in extent, and he presumed it was the best spot\r\non the little farm which Miss Pringle had sold Battick along with the\r\nold homestead.\r\n\r\nThe undulating field of grain was shoulder high and was now all of a\r\nwonderful golden hue. Such a field of golden luxuriance Hiram had never\r\nbefore seen. The wheat was of a bearded variety, the awns very stiff\r\nand long, while the ear itself was the fullest and longest Hiram had\r\never seen.\r\n\r\n\"It is a picture! A picture!\" he declared with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nYancey Battick's leathery face lit up as might the face of an artist\r\nwho heard his masterpiece praised. His gloomy eyes glowed. There was\r\neven a smile trembling on his lips as he said:\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Mr. Strong. It is one of the finest pictures ever\r\npainted by Nature. A field of wheat, when you consider it, is the most\r\nwonderful thing to contemplate on this, our western hemisphere. Next\r\nto rice, it is the grain most depended upon as the staple of human\r\nconsumption. And when used in its entire, or whole, state it has no\r\nrival for nourishment and health.\r\n\r\n\"An entire rationing of a people with rice may, some medical men claim,\r\nnourish the germ of leprosy; we know that badly cured corn is the start\r\nof the dreaded pelagra. But wheat--even when refined and bleached until\r\nits goodness is all but wasted--brings no disease in its train save\r\nindigestion and that quite an unnecessary result of its use. Ground as\r\na whole grain and properly baked, we need not even fear indigestion.\r\nMore and more is the bread made from wheat becoming the Staff of Life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly have a variety here,\" Hiram said, carefully examining\r\none of the ears, \"that might well be named that when you put it on the\r\nmarket, Mr. Battick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Named what?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Staff of Life Wheat,' you know,\" Hiram said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"A good suggestion, Mr. Strong--a cracking good suggestion,\" declared\r\nBattick, with some enthusiasm. \"I'll bear that in mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can I have one of these heads, Mr. Battick?\" Hiram asked.\r\n\"Frankly, I'd like to show it to Mr. Bronson.\"\r\n\r\nThe man started, reddened, and glared at the young farmer sharply\r\nagain. His easily roused suspicion was immediately awakened. But Hiram\r\nlooked at him steadily--unwinkingly. Battick's gaze finally fell.\r\n\r\n\"You know how I feel about it, Mr. Strong. Your Mr. Bronson may be an\r\nall right man; but it was just such men as he appears to be who robbed\r\nme of my Mortgage Lifter Oats.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't rob you, I guarantee,\" Hiram said shortly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Battick plucked several of the long plants and handed them to\r\nHiram.\r\n\r\n\"You won't find their like around this part of the country, that is\r\nsure,\" the proud owner of the new wheat said. \"If I had better land on\r\nwhich, this coming fall, to plant the grain I have, I should feel the\r\ntime was ripe next season to sound some seedsman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will make a fortune out of it, Mr. Battick,\" said Hiram\r\nwith earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"No fear!\" bitterly returned the man. \"But I mean to try. Of course,\r\nMr. Strong, I'd just as soon you wouldn't show that grain to everybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or tell the folks around here where you got it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trust me,\" rejoined the young man.\r\n\r\nAfter he had left Battick, however, he thought of something. There was\r\nprobably one person in the neighborhood--or of the neighborhood--who\r\nknew about Battick's wheat and about Battick's former ill-fated\r\nattempts to make something out of breeding seed.\r\n\r\nShould he turn back and speak to Battick about Adam Banks? Ad had gone\r\naway. Hiram had heard that after the night of the dance at Sunnyside\r\nthe fellow had gone to another county and was working on a farm.\r\n\r\n\"Let sleeping dogs lie,\" muttered the young farm manager. \"And Ad Banks\r\nis a dog all right.\"\r\n\r\nThe twenty acres of the Sunnyside farm along the county road, and on\r\nwhich Hiram had made his experiment in underdraining, was now in shape\r\nfor replanting. There had been no rain, but if a farmer did not have\r\nhope--and especially hope in helpful weather conditions--there would\r\nbe few crops planted. The twenty acres were made into a smooth and\r\ngood seed bed; but when he went upon it with the Percherons and the\r\ngrain-drill the dust rose and floated in a stifling cloud across the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that a part of my bone meal is drifting off this field\r\nwith the dust,\" he told Orrin. \"Loose as ashes, by jinks! But if I can\r\nget the seed in and covered deep, and if a rain comes--\"\r\n\r\nHe had stopped every other spout of the drill and filled the boxes\r\nalternately with silage corn and cowpeas. The drill had to be arranged\r\nin a particular way to sow these large grains properly.\r\n\r\nThe corn was of a low-growing variety and the ears would be pretty\r\nsure to glaze in seventy-five days. The cowpeas, rich in nitrogen\r\nand a soil improver almost unsurpassed, would be at their best\r\ncondition--green-podded and with the leaves still clinging to the\r\nvines--when the corn was ready to cut. Harvested together, shredded and\r\nblown into the silo, this crop should pretty well fill that huge tank.\r\n\r\nThere were now on Sunnyside nearly forty head of yearlings and\r\ntwo-year-olds. Mr. Bronson picked up all the strays about his other\r\nfarms and brought them to Hiram. The Sunnyside pastures were in good\r\ncondition, and now all the young cattle were far down in the river-lots\r\ngetting sleek and fat at practically no expense to their owner.\r\n\r\nHiram desired to have plenty of the right kind of feed for them the\r\ncoming winter. And the next year he hoped to feed the herd almost\r\naltogether at the barns so as to conserve a greater proportion of the\r\nfertilizer which the cattle made.\r\n\r\nYes, Hiram desired to see that silo filled, and with just such\r\nsucculent silage as would make the herd of young cattle put on flesh\r\nat a cheap rate. He got the twenty acres planted, and the Saturday\r\nafternoon he finished the job, thunder heads gathered in the west and\r\nsouth, threatening a tempest if nothing more.\r\n\r\nDolan and MacComb were pretty well along with the new house now. In\r\nfact, by hastening the erection of that building the carpenters had\r\nneglected the completion of the silo, although Hiram had spoken of this\r\nneglect on several occasions.\r\n\r\nOf course, he had no authority over the contractors or their men; but\r\nthe iron hoops and cable-stays for the silo not having been at hand\r\nwhen the walls of the tank were completed and the roof on, the gang had\r\nbeen taken off the silo job and had not gone back to finish it.\r\n\r\nWhen Hiram and Orrin drove the sweating team of Percherons back to the\r\nyard with the drill the carpenters had picked up their tools for the\r\nday and were getting ready to depart in a big auto-bus for Plympton.\r\nThey all went home over Sunday, and besides Hiram and Orrin Post only\r\none farm laborer and a boy remained on Sunnyside over the week-end.\r\nEven the cook went home, and the four remaining on the farm had to make\r\nout as well as they could with amateur cooking until Monday morning.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is all right at the house, Mr. Strong,\" said the boss\r\ncarpenter to Hiram. \"The windows are in and the roof is tight at last.\r\nIf it rains it can't do us any harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say!\" exclaimed the young farmer. \"How about if a big wind came up?\r\nThose clouds over yonder look ugly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no baby tornado is going to do the house any damage,\" declared the\r\nboss, following his men into the bus.\r\n\r\n\"How about the silo? Suppose something happens to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that'll be all right. Anyway, it is too late to put those bands on\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or the wire stays?\" cried Hiram as the automobile started.\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! You are an old Betty, Hi Strong!\" sang out one of the\r\ncarpenters as the machine rolled out of the yard. \"I don't believe it\r\nwill rain enough to lay the dust.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, that prophecy went by the board before Hiram and his helpers\r\ngot the chores done at Sunnyside that evening. They ran for the shack\r\nas the big drops of water began to fall. The drops soon turned to\r\nsheets of wind-driven rain that slatted against the walls of the shed\r\nlike sleet.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the supper preparations Orrin opened the door to look\r\nout. He stared through the thinning rain toward the south.\r\n\r\n\"She's letting up, boys,\" he said confidently, and then turned to look\r\nacross the road and up the hillside. Immediately his voice changed and\r\nthe cry he uttered was one of positive fear.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Hiram shouted, and all of them darted out of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe moment the old man, Blodger by name, looked over the shoulder of\r\nthe hill he threw up his hands and shrieked:\r\n\r\n\"It's coming! Tornado! The wind'll change and come from the\r\nnorth--right from the North Pole--in a minute. There!\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant it was calm and the rain ceased. Then, with a whistle\r\nand roar and the sudden writhing of the branches in the wood, the\r\ntornado came. It might be only a \"baby,\" but to Hiram's mind the\r\nfunnel of black cloud sweeping down upon Sunnyside seemed a full-grown\r\nwind-storm indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                          DISASTER THREATENS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Who's that scurrying down the road toward Pringleton?\" demanded\r\nBlodger in the lull before the tornado struck Sunnyside.\r\n\r\nThey all saw the man hurrying along the county road with the tails of\r\nhis coat over his head. Jim Larry, the boy, shrieked:\r\n\r\n\"I believe that is Ad Banks. What's he doing around here? I thought he\r\nwas working over at Loomisville.\"\r\n\r\nNobody gave the running figure much attention. The phenomenon of the\r\ncoming tornado quite filled their minds.\r\n\r\nThe whine of the wind rose to a demoniac shriek. Hiram turned to shout\r\nto his companions and a sudden gust seemed to take his breath so\r\ncompletely that he could not utter a sound.\r\n\r\nHe staggered, crouching, and seized Orrin Post who was actually being\r\nswept down the yard by the force of the gust. Jim Larry had scuttled to\r\ncover. Blodger stood in the doorway of the shack yelling something that\r\nHiram could not understand.\r\n\r\nThe trees across the road and up the hillside bent and writhed as\r\nthough seeking to uproot themselves. Into the air sprang a shed on the\r\nPringle place, and when it had crossed the road and was about ten feet\r\nabove the ground it fairly exploded as though a bomb had been set off\r\ninside of it.\r\n\r\nThen the tornado struck Sunnyside--struck the place in all its fury.\r\n\r\nThere was not much rain, but what there was, blown by this terrible\r\ngale, cut like a knife. Loose boards began to fly over the yard.\r\nEverything the wind could get under seemed to shoot right up into the\r\nair. There was a cloud of light litter sucked up into the churning\r\nblack mass that was flying over the farm.\r\n\r\nHiram and Orrin had managed to get into the lee of the shed. The wind\r\nthundered against it, shaking the structure as though to tear it loose\r\nfrom its foundations. But being low it did not offer the resistance\r\nof a higher structure, and perhaps was as safe from disaster as any\r\nbuilding about the farm.\r\n\r\n\"Unless we got into the cellar,\" Orrin managed to make Hiram hear.\r\n\r\n\"Seems as though this wind would scoop us right out of a cellar,\"\r\nshouted Hiram. \"Hey! Look there!\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the corner of the barn where the silo stood. The round\r\ntank positively shook under the recurrent blows of the wind!\r\n\r\n\"She's going!\" yelled Orrin in dismay. \"She's going!\"\r\n\r\n\"Like fun she is!\" returned the other young fellow. \"Those bands and\r\ncables should have been put on. But as the tank's empty and there is\r\nnothing to hold her down, she'll shift on her foundation if we don't do\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't help it, Strong,\" objected Orrin.\r\n\r\n\"We can try,\" returned Hiram forcefully. \"You get Blodger and Jim. I'm\r\ngoing over there. There are two sets of fastenings for the cables on\r\nthe barn and the barn won't blow down--that's a sure thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that it is a sure thing,\" grumbled Orrin. \"You'll take\r\nyour life in your hands if you go out there.\"\r\n\r\nBut Hiram had already started. The wind did not come steadily, and he\r\nran stooping between gusts to the silo. The wire cables, cut as he knew\r\nto proper length and wound on a spool, lay with some other material\r\nagainst the barn foundations.\r\n\r\nOf course, Hiram knew they could not put on the iron bands; but if they\r\ncould pass a couple of the length of cable around the silo and fasten\r\nthem to the barn Hiram was sure it would aid in keeping the tank on its\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nHe looked back across the yard and saw Orrin propel the frightened Jim\r\nout of the doorway of the shack; and he had to fairly drag Blodger out\r\nas well. Both the old man and the boy knew these tornadoes too well to\r\ndesire to be out-of-doors.\r\n\r\nHiram was endeavoring to unwind the first cable alone when the others\r\nreached him. He had fastened the end of the twisted wire through one\r\nof the rings in the side of the barn about eight feet from the ground.\r\nThey unwound the entire length of this first cable, struggling against\r\nthe wind, and carrying the end around the silo.\r\n\r\nHere the fastening ring was too high to be reached without the aid of\r\na ladder. The carpenters had left their various ladders behind the\r\nnew house. Hiram spied them, and, shouting to Orrin to come with him,\r\nstarted against the wind for that place.\r\n\r\nThey had actually to tack like a boat in a heavy seaway to reach the\r\nladders. And coming back, each bearing an end of the ladder selected,\r\nthey were blown to the ground half a dozen times.\r\n\r\nThis was the most awful gale Hiram, at least, had ever been out in.\r\nAnd for the four of them to raise the light ladder was one of the most\r\nserious tasks one could imagine.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the silo was weaving back and forth in a threatening manner.\r\nHiram had selected a ladder long enough to enable him to reach the\r\nupper ring intended for the second cable. Two of his helpers had to\r\nhold the ladder steady, however, while the other handed him the end\r\nof the wire cable. It took more than half an hour of hard fighting to\r\nsecure both ends of the two wire ropes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two of his helpers had to hold the ladder steady while\r\nthe other handed him the end of the wire cable.]\r\n\r\nThe silo rocked back and forth, the vibrations seeming, of course,\r\nmuch greater than they really were. But the cables--or good\r\nworkmanship--held it in place. The four got back to the living shack\r\nand cowered therein in darkness for another two hours before the wind\r\nreally ceased blowing. The rain had stopped long since, and beyond the\r\nhurrying shreds of cloud the moon and stars appeared.\r\n\r\nDrenched as everything had been by the first tempest, the ground was\r\nnow fast becoming dry. The water drained away quickly from the knoll on\r\nwhich the Sunnyside buildings stood.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the danger from the big wind was over, however, Hiram had\r\nthought for another thing. He lit a lantern and said to Orrin:\r\n\r\n\"Come on down the road and take a look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who for? That Ad Banks? If he's drowned in the ditch I wouldn't much\r\ncare.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd forgotten all about him,\" confessed Hiram. \"But come on. I want to\r\nlook at something.\"\r\n\r\nCuriously Orrin followed him while the old man and the boy sought their\r\nbunks. The rain had washed and rutted the road deeply. The ditches were\r\ncarrying the surplus water off, however.\r\n\r\nAt the first cross-drain through the recently planted corn and pea\r\nfield Hiram flashed the light of his lantern into the ditch. A stream\r\nof water the size of his leg was spurting from the opening.\r\n\r\n\"Cracky! Look at that!\" ejaculated Orrin. \"Why, Strong, _the darned\r\nthing works_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it works. Didn't I tell you it would?\" replied the young\r\nfarm manager.\r\n\r\nThey went on along the road, and at every such opening the yellow flood\r\npoured forth. That particular twenty acres of Sunnyside Farm would\r\nnever be sour or lumpy to work as long as Hiram's simple underdraining\r\nscheme continued to work so successfully as it was now doing.\r\n\r\nThey were about to turn to go back to the house when Orrin clutched\r\nHiram by the arm and pointed toward Yancey Battick's place.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter down there do you suppose?\" he asked, with anxiety.\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden glow against the sky, seemingly rising from behind\r\nBattick's buildings. Then a long streamer of flame bannered into the\r\nair above the treetops.\r\n\r\n\"It's a fire! Something's burning!\" declared Hiram.\r\n\r\nThe two lads set off on a hard run down the road toward the old Pringle\r\nhomestead which Yancey Battick occupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                               A BARGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Hiram Strong and Orrin Post reached the strip of woodland that\r\ndivided the open field of Sunnyside from the old Pringle place they\r\nheard somebody shouting. After the passing of the rain and the terrible\r\ngale of wind the whole countryside seemed very quiet. This raucous\r\nvoice could have been heard a mile:\r\n\r\n\"Fire! Fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be his house,\" Orrin panted, having some difficulty in keeping\r\nup with the young farm manager.\r\n\r\n\"That flame is too far back for the house,\" Hiram rejoined with\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\"The barn, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is something at any rate,\" was the grim reply.\r\n\r\nThe flames were streaming high in the air; yet before the young fellows\r\nreached Battick's gate the fire seemed decreasing. They could still\r\nhear Battick hoarsely shouting.\r\n\r\nEntering by the gate they dashed around the house and out behind the\r\nbarns. Hiram had felt, although he had not said it to Orrin, that he\r\nknew the nature of the disaster. Yancey Battick's stack of wheat was\r\nmore than half consumed!\r\n\r\nHe had been running madly from pump to stack, trying to throw enough\r\nwater on the sheaves to put out the fire. But the blaze had burned up\r\nthrough the very heart of the stack. It must have, indeed, to have\r\nburned the wheat at all after the exceedingly heavy rain of three hours\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"You're too late! Too late!\" shrieked the man wildly. \"They have got\r\nme again. What did I tell you, Strong?\" for he recognized the young\r\nmanager of Sunnyside by the fading light of the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you pull the stack to pieces?\" shouted Orrin, beginning to\r\nburrow into the bottom of the stack which the fire seemed not to have\r\nconsumed, a good deal as a terrier would burrow for a rat. \"Come on,\r\nHiram. We can save some of this wheat.\"\r\n\r\nBut the sheaves which he dragged out proved to have had their heads\r\nentirely burned. Although the flames soon flickered out and left but a\r\nsmouldering heap, there was but very little wheat left.\r\n\r\n\"They got me again! They got me again!\" mourned the shaken Battick.\r\n\"What did I tell you, Mr. Strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Battick, do you really believe some enemy burned your wheat\r\nstack?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly was no friend of mine,\" returned the man laughing wildly.\r\n\r\n\"You said a true word there, Brother,\" Orrin Post remarked bluntly.\r\n\"Whom do you suspect?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who about here knew anything about this wheat?\" asked Hiram. \"Yes, you\r\nmight as well let Orrin know about it. I can assure you I have not told\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Post curiously.\r\n\r\n\"This wheat!\" almost sobbed Yancey Battick. \"It was a special variety\r\nthat I was raising for seed. They have burned it up on me! Oh, the\r\nrascals!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who do you suspect?\" demanded Orrin again. \"Couldn't it have been set\r\non fire by accident?\"\r\n\r\n\"How by accident? There was no lightning accompanied that tempest. I\r\ntell you somebody came here and set it off. I have had as bad done to\r\nme before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who could it have been?\" Hiram murmured. \"And so soon after that\r\nterrible wind. You wouldn't think anybody would have gone out in that\r\ngale to do a neighbor an ill turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" ejaculated Orrin suddenly. \"There's that Ad Banks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" demanded Hiram turning around quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean that he is here now,\" Orrin said grimly. \"But don't you\r\nremember we saw him coming down the road in this direction in the\r\nmiddle of that rain storm?\"\r\n\r\n\"So we did,\" Hiram agreed.\r\n\r\n\"Banks isn't at home now,\" said Yancey Battick, looking at the two\r\nyoung fellows doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"We saw him all right,\" Orrin declared. \"Jim Larry who works up at\r\nSunnyside knows him well. Lives right on the next farm to the Bankses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Battick!\" exclaimed Hiram, smitten by a new thought, \"have you\r\never had any trouble with Ad Banks?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you once I had to run him off my place.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there is something I did not tell you,\" Hiram went on. \"Remember\r\nthe day I was over looking at your wheat field? Back there in the\r\nspring, I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I remember, Mr. Strong,\" said Battick, reddening.\r\n\r\n\"When I left you that day I chanced to see Adam Banks sneaking through\r\nthe underbrush away from that very log on which we had been sitting to\r\ntalk!\"\r\n\r\n\"Had he been eavesdropping?\" demanded Battick angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Like enough. I did not give it much thought at the time. But he may\r\nhave learned at that time all about this special wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did it!\" ejaculated Battick. \"He was paid to do it, I bet.\"\r\n\r\n\"We-ell,\" said Hiram thoughtfully, \"that's rather jumping at\r\nconclusions without much evidence. But it might be.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is!\" repeated Yancey Battick. \"They told me Ad Banks went over to\r\nLoomisville to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is right,\" Orrin said.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Battick significantly to Hiram, \"is where I lived before\r\nI came here. They robbed me of my Mortgage Lifter Oats over in that\r\nneighborhood.\"\r\n\r\nOrrin looked at him curiously, but Hiram understood.\r\n\r\n\"You think they might have sent Ad over here to do this?\" the manager\r\nof Sunnyside said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure they did.\"\r\n\r\nBut Hiram was not convinced. He began to see flaws in this theory.\r\n\r\n\"How did Banks set it off? How could anybody have set it off?\" he\r\nqueried.\r\n\r\n\"With a match,\" said Orrin, grinning faintly in the lantern light.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" Hiram said. \"But we saw Banks coming down this way\r\nwhen the rain was almost over. This stack was thoroughly wet on the\r\noutside by that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was set off somehow inside,\" interposed Battick. \"When I looked out\r\nof my door after the big wind the flames were shooting right out of the\r\npeak of the stack. It had been smouldering all that time deep down in\r\nthe heart of the pile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Well, like the famous query about the old woodchuck's hole: How\r\ndid the fire get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Battick and Orrin in unison.\r\n\r\n\"If the fire had been set before the wind, it would have spread much\r\nsooner. Doesn't that stand to reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh!\" agreed Orrin, although Battick looked doubtful.\r\n\r\n\"Of course! And if it was set on fire after the wind stopped, how did\r\nthe incendiary get his fire into the heart of the wet stack?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're just asking questions,\" snarled Battick. \"Why don't you say\r\nsomething that is worth while?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will say something,\" replied Hiram. \"I'll say this much: Perhaps\r\nyour stack was not burned by an enemy, Mr. Battick. It might even be\r\nyour own fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" snapped the other with a sour look.\r\n\r\n\"You are a smoker,\" said Hiram; \"and it might be that you dropped a\r\nmatch when you were stacking this wheat. It's been done more than once.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" cried Battick, \"That it has taken all this time for\r\na match to ignite? Do you mean by spontaneous combustion?\" he scoffed.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. I mean that it may have been ignited by the sharp little\r\nteeth of a field mouse. Such things have happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right!\" exclaimed Orrin. \"I believe a fodder stack where I\r\nworked once was burned in that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mice and rats have been my bane since I came to this old Pringle place\r\nto live,\" admitted Yancey Battick slowly. \"But I think your idea is\r\nfar-fetched, Mr. Strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"At least, it is as good an idea as that Adam Banks set the stack off.\r\nWe ought to find proof before we accuse the fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean to accuse him. What good would that do?\" demanded Battick\r\nin disgust. \"The harm is done. I've lost my wheat--\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have all that in the house for fall seed,\" Hiram said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" growled Battick. \"And I mean to guard that with my gun. I mean\r\nto warn everybody that I'll put something besides rock-salt in my\r\nshotgun after this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" ejaculated Orrin Post, \"you sound very savage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not blame you for feeling as you do, Mr. Battick,\" said Hiram\r\ncautiously, \"even although I think you have jumped to a wrong\r\nconclusion. But I am sure trying to shoot your neighbors, good or bad,\r\nwill not help you. I have an idea I'd like to talk over with you and\r\nwill do so the next time I am down this way. But it is time we were all\r\nin bed now.\"\r\n\r\nHe and Orrin started back for Sunnyside. The latter asked Hiram:\r\n\r\n\"Where do you suppose that Ad Banks did go, Strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the least idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think he had nothing to do with that fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"At least, Battick can show no proof. Suspicion only, breeds trouble. I\r\nam inclined to blame the field mouse instead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! Well, maybe,\" grumbled Orrin Post.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate it will do no good to spread abroad any suspicions you\r\nmay feel about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We-ell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Promise me you will not speak of Banks in connection with the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right! If you don't want me to,\" said Orrin promptly.\r\n\r\n\"It's a bargain,\" Hiram rejoined, and they dropped the subject for the\r\ntime being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                        A PARTNERSHIP IS FORMED\r\n\r\n\r\nNot until morning was the full result of the tornado revealed on and\r\nabout Sunnyside. Most of the buildings being comparatively new, Hiram\r\nfound that few had suffered. The sheds were under the break of the\r\nhill, anyway; therefore he looked for little misfortune there.\r\n\r\nThe silo had suffered despite the efforts they had made to stay it with\r\nthe wire ropes. It had a decided list to the east and was no longer set\r\ntrue upon its cement foundation. The neglect of the carpenters in not\r\nstaying it firmly before the storm came was a matter that would have to\r\nbe settled between them and Mr. Bronson. Hiram was glad it did not come\r\nunder his jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe young farm manager had enough trouble of his own. The heavy rain\r\nwhich had preceded the gale of wind had beaten some of the corn on the\r\nlowlands almost flat to the ground. It was about two feet high and the\r\nsun of Sunday, the day following the tempest, began to revive the corn.\r\n\r\nBut it was evident that it would be impossible to get into those fields\r\nwith the cultivators for several days. At this stage of the corn crop\r\ncontinual cultivation was necessary. Hiram had always followed a system\r\nof cultivation not altogether approved of by corn raisers in this\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nAll cultivation, Hiram had previously held, should not be shallow. It\r\nwas all right to use a two- or three-horse hoe as most of the corn-belt\r\nfarmers do, until the plant is half-leg high. But after that Hiram\r\nbelieved in using the fluke harrow.\r\n\r\n\"Now we've seen something of what can be done to a field of corn by\r\na big wind and rain. If such another baby tornado comes in August or\r\nSeptember,\" Hiram said to Orrin Post, \"and knocks the corn down, it\r\nnever will recover unless the area of rootage is very wide and strong.\r\n\r\n\"In the South they plow corn in July to hold up the stalk through\r\nheavy winds and rains; but that leaves the land in bad shape for the\r\nfollowing tillage. I like to use a fluke harrow and cultivate deep.\r\nTear right through the small roots and rip them apart. That more than\r\ndoubles the root-system and finally gives the plant a hold on the soil\r\nthat will enable it to stand up under almost any kind of blow and\r\nrain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shallow and frequent cultivation seems to be the rule around here,\"\r\nOrrin remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And Mr. Turner tells me that only year before last he lost\r\nfifteen acres in one piece by the corn being knocked down in a big wind\r\nand hail storm just as it was silking. However, our cultivating is\r\ngoing awfully slow. I don't know but I shall have to get Mr. Bronson\r\nto furnish one of those three-horse hoes for next year, if I am really\r\ngoing to make a corn crop.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation was carried on while Hiram and Orrin were driving\r\nover to the pasture behind Jerry, and carrying with them a tub of salt\r\nfor the cattle. Salting the cattle is always a Sunday job on the farm;\r\nbut as a usual thing Hiram went to church before going to the pasture.\r\n\r\nThey had got up too late on the morning after the tornado, however, to\r\ndrive to the church service. It was only high noon when they came to\r\nthe pasture gate.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see that spotted yearling,\" Orrin said, as he climbed down to\r\nopen the gate and the herd began to turn toward them. \"He's usually\r\nright at the head of the bunch.\"\r\n\r\n\"That red one with the crooked horn is missing, too,\" Hiram said, \"I am\r\nafraid something has happened, Orrin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they've just strayed away,\" said Post cheerfully. \"Don't be\r\nworried.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, after the herd had come up and been counted and they found\r\nthat four were missing, even Orrin acknowledged that there was reason\r\nfor anxiety. They salted the young stock and then left Jerry to graze\r\nwhile they beat the pasture brush and the woods adjoining in search of\r\nthe four missing animals.\r\n\r\nThere was a plain path of the tornado's passing in this patch of wood.\r\nSeveral trees were uprooted and one huge forest monarch that had been\r\nstruck by lightning years before and had stood dead and stripped of\r\nbark, had been snapped off at the butt.\r\n\r\nUnder its heavy and sprawling limbs lay the four young steers, their\r\nbacks broken by the weight of the fallen tree.\r\n\r\n\"There lies a hundred dollars profit, as sure as you live, Orrin,\"\r\nHiram Strong declared. \"I hate to tell Mr. Bronson that. And look at\r\nthat silo, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" said the other, but looking grimly at the dead cattle.\r\n\"You did not bring the wind, I should hope. And that silo isn't your\r\nbusiness, either.\"\r\n\r\nHiram, nevertheless, was much disturbed by the unfortunate accident.\r\nMr. Bronson and Lettie came up to Sunnyside that afternoon. The loss\r\nof the young cattle was, of course, irreparable; but the owner of\r\nSunnyside declared he would demand that Dolan and MacComb straighten\r\nup the silo and make it firm before the next wind.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I would have been wiser had I built the silo of cement, after\r\nall,\" he said to his young farm manager. \"It is hard to know sometimes\r\nwhere real economy begins. 'Penny wise and pound foolish' is not my\r\nusual failing--\r\n\r\n\"How about your log drains, Hiram? That was another economy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have seen the water spurting out of the drains after that\r\nbig rain last night. Come down there and have a look now.\"\r\n\r\nHe included Lettie in this invitation and hoped that she would come;\r\nbut the girl tossed her head, although it was with a smile that she\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\n\"That is all I hear--farming,\" she said. \"Now that I have finished\r\nschool I think papa ought to take me to some summer resort this year.\r\nI'm tired of Plympton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait till you are grown up, Lettie,\" said Mr. Bronson carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"If I'm not grown up yet, when shall I be?\" asked the girl. \"I'll soon\r\nbe an old maid like Delia Pringle.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson and Hiram laughed at this statement. But the latter felt\r\nthat Lettie was more in earnest than her father considered. St. Beris\r\nseemed to develop its pupils rather early. Hiram was glad that Sister\r\ndid not attend that school--not, however, that he really compared\r\nSister to Lettie Bronson in any way!\r\n\r\nHowever, Lettie Bronson went over to call on Miss Pringle while her\r\nfather and Hiram started down the road toward Battick's place. From\r\nevery drain the water was still pouring into the roadside ditch, but of\r\ncourse not in the volume it had the night before.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson cheered up immediately when he saw this.\r\n\r\n\"And not a puddle in sight on the whole twenty acres! Well, Hiram, it\r\nlooks as though you had done a good job here--and saved me money. We\r\nwon't worry over the dead yearlings. That you certainly could not help.\r\nThe tree you tell about must have fallen in the midst of the herd. It\r\nis fortunate no more of them were killed.\r\n\r\n\"One of my neighbors near Plympton had his barn torn to pieces last\r\nnight and all his cattle killed. Who else suffered around here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not sure that anybody suffered much damage by the tornado, but\r\nYancey Battick lost his stack of wheat--and it was a wonder of a stack!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he have much?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the handsomest wheat I ever saw,\" Hiram told him earnestly. \"I\r\nwant to show you a sample of it that he gave me, Mr. Bronson. I think\r\nthere would have been thirty-five or forty bushels of it when it was\r\nthrashed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! At the price wheat is going to be--\"\r\n\r\n\"He has got a new variety and had raised it for seed,\" Hiram explained.\r\n\r\nWhen they got back to the farm buildings he showed his employer the\r\nheads of grain Battick had given him. They shelled out the wheat. Every\r\ngrain of it was perfect, with the tiny red stripe upon one side. Hiram\r\nwatched Mr. Bronson's face with interest as the big farmer examined the\r\nkernels of wheat.\r\n\r\n\"My goodness, Hiram!\" exclaimed the man at last, \"do you mean to say\r\nthat Battick had bred this wheat--that it is all alike?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have every reason to believe it is all fully as good as that in your\r\nhand and true to type.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he's lost it all?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has lost his crop for this year. He believes the stack was set on\r\nfire.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. And you cannot blame him after what he has been through. Let\r\nme tell you, Mr. Bronson.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat down and Hiram related the details of the story Yancey Battick\r\nhad told him, as well as of his own adventures with the strange man.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" was Mr. Bronson's first comment, \"I had an idea that Battick\r\nwas not quite right in his head. But I guess he is sane enough. And an\r\neducated man, too, isn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should not wonder if he were college-bred; only he has grown\r\ncareless of speech. And he certainly is a crank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who could blame him?\" muttered Mr. Bronson thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nThey discussed the matter at some length, and gradually Hiram got\r\naround to a plan that had formed in the back of his mind since he had\r\nlearned so much about Yancey Battick's new wheat.\r\n\r\nHiram had come by this time to know his employer pretty well. Not only\r\nwas Mr. Stephen Bronson a money-maker and deeply interested in any new\r\nagricultural idea, but he was the sort of business man who is always\r\nwilling to take a legitimate chance.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Bronson had a choice of making a sure ten dollars and a possible\r\nhundred dollars, he would naturally take the long chance. It was\r\ncharacteristic of him to be immediately interested by the story of\r\nYancey Battick's wonderful new wheat. And when Hiram pointed out a way\r\nby which Battick, Bronson and Hiram himself might form a partnership\r\nto breed and exploit the new variety of grain without taking any\r\nseedhouse into the scheme, Mr. Bronson was eager for it.\r\n\r\n\"If you can make Battick see it, I'll find all the cash necessary. A\r\nseed firm would want to hog it--they always do. Battick must know that.\r\nIf he's got a good grain and we can introduce it ourselves to the grain\r\nfarmers farther west, we'll all make money,\" Mr. Bronson declared with\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThat very week Hiram arranged a meeting and the three discussed the\r\nplan fully in the shaded dooryard of the old Pringle homestead. The\r\nloss of his whole crop--a possible forty and surely thirty bushels of\r\nthe grain--had vastly discouraged Yancey Battick. The sensible way in\r\nwhich Hiram had approached him before introducing Mr. Bronson into the\r\nmatter encouraged the unfortunate wheat breeder to look favorably upon\r\nthe assistance that Mr. Bronson was able and willing to lend.\r\n\r\nWhether the wheat stack had been set on fire maliciously or had been\r\ndestroyed by accident, as Hiram had pointed out, the fact remained that\r\nif the crop had been properly handled the grain would not have been\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the wheat had not been allowed to cure long enough\r\nin the shock before being stacked. Battick admitted that he had only\r\nstacked it because he dared not leave the shocks in the field for long.\r\nHe had camped in the field with his gun every night until he built the\r\nstack at the barn.\r\n\r\nIn fact, to conserve the wheat and handle it in the best shape, it\r\nshould have been cured in the shock and then thrashed immediately,\r\nafterwards being spread in a proper granary. There was no granary on\r\nthe old Pringle place and the rats and mice were a pest, as Hiram had\r\nseen the first time he had met Yancey Battick.\r\n\r\nIn fact, taking it all around Battick had tried to do the impossible.\r\nHe had neither capital nor land nor housing facilities to develop and\r\ngrow a sufficiently large crop of the new wheat to make its sale for\r\nseed a profitable venture.\r\n\r\n\"You tell me that you lost everything on your Mortgage Lifter Oats\r\nundertaking,\" Hiram said to him. \"So far you have tried to keep\r\nsecret your new wheat, and you have lost out. If your neighbors have\r\nnot robbed you, and if the burning of the wheat stack was not a case\r\nof incendiarism, it was a sure thing that the rats and the mice are\r\nagainst you. I do not believe that one man alone can handle such an\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you make a contract with Mr. Bronson for two years, during\r\nwhich the wheat can be properly developed and a big crop raised. You\r\nfurnish such seed as you have left--half to be planted this fall, the\r\nremainder to be held against chance of accident. Mr. Bronson will\r\nsupply the land, the fertilizer, the tillage, paying for the harvesting\r\nand thrashing and storage, as well as for any guard that may be needed\r\nif trouble should arise. You'll make more under the terms of such a\r\npartnership than you would if you made the crop entirely by yourself\r\nand sold out to a seedsman.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where do you come in, Mr. Strong?\" Battick had asked.\r\n\r\n\"If you go fifty-fifty with Mr. Bronson on the final profit obtained\r\nfrom the exploitation of the wheat, I'll get my share from Mr.\r\nBronson,\" Hiram said.\r\n\r\nThe proposal was most thoroughly thrashed out between the three, and in\r\nthe end an agreement following closely Hiram Strong's suggestion was\r\ndrawn up and signed by Yancey Battick and Mr. Bronson. Hiram being a\r\nminor, he could not enter into the partnership agreement; but he had\r\nhis own contract with the owner of Sunnyside Farm by which he was to\r\nhave a half interest in Mr. Bronson's share of the profits from the\r\nwheat transaction, if profits there were.\r\n\r\nAnd, under fairly favorable conditions, from what he had already seen\r\nof Yancey Battick's new wheat, the young manager of Sunnyside Farm\r\nwas confident the profit for all would be large. He already had five\r\nhundred dollars in the bank when he came to Sunnyside. From his wages\r\nas farm manager he expected to lay aside at least two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars each quarter while his contract lasted.\r\n\r\nAnd for every dollar of these savings to which he looked forward, Hiram\r\nStrong had a definite use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                          A STRANGER APPEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram Strong was learning something about corn growing that he had not\r\nfound out before. That is, after all, one of the greatest charms of the\r\nscience of agriculture: There is always something new to learn.\r\n\r\nThere is in addition always something new to find out regarding the\r\nmethods adopted in different localities for the cultivation of the same\r\ncrop. Farmers who have cultivated a certain plant in a certain locality\r\nwhere their fathers and grandfathers have grown the same plant, usually\r\ndevelop an almost uncanny knowledge of the conditions under which that\r\nparticular plant will best grow and come to fruitage.\r\n\r\nAll the scientific knowledge of farming methods does not come from the\r\nagriculture colleges; the ordinary farmer often cultivates his crop in\r\na certain way because it is the right way without knowing the reason\r\nfor following that particular method.\r\n\r\nOne thing about growing corn in this Middle West section of the\r\ncountry was fast becoming a conviction in Hiram Strong's mind. Methods\r\nwhich had grown him a bumper crop of corn in the East might work quite\r\nas well here on Sunnyside Farm, but there had arisen objections to\r\nthem. He had admitted as much to Orrin Post on a recent occasion.\r\n\r\nHis old methods were quite necessary for the locality in which he had\r\nused them. But corn growing on the Atterson Eighty and corn growing on\r\nSunnyside Farm were two distinctly different matters.\r\n\r\n\"Always something new to learn,\" Hiram said to his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Right you are,\" answered Orrin. \"A good deal to learn,\" and he sighed\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\nThroughout July and more than half of August Hiram and Orrin worked\r\nalmost on the run to keep up with the growing corn. Jerry and his mate\r\nlost flesh under this grilling work. To get over all the fields, and at\r\nthe proper time, with one-horse cultivators, was an almost superhuman\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nBesides, Hiram watched the shallow cultivation of his neighbors'\r\ncorn. They used two- and three-horse knife-hoes that stirred the soil\r\nscarcely an inch deep and left the earth between the rows just as level\r\nas the harrow had left it when the field was first smoothed.\r\n\r\nMost of these farms about Sunnyside were more heavily manured than\r\nthe fields that Hiram cultivated. The neighboring farms had not been\r\ncropped to death by careless tenants.\r\n\r\nThese neighbors planted their corn in rows rather than checking it. The\r\nstalks stood twelve to fifteen inches apart in the row, making more\r\nthan twice the number of hills to the acre than Hiram had planted.\r\n\r\nHe was satisfied that he had planted and left to grow all the corn his\r\nland would develop properly. Two stalks to a hill and two good ears to\r\na stalk was better to his mind than more fodder and less corn.\r\n\r\nThe cultivating method followed by the neighboring farmers was not\r\nall it might be. The two- and three-horse cultivators left much to be\r\ndesired. There were more weeds left in the row than Hiram cared to see.\r\nWhen he and Orrin got through cultivating a piece of corn they could\r\nsafely have offered a prize for any weed in the field that had not been\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, however, Hiram had something to learn, too.\r\nThis land was not so cursed with weeds as that he had been used to\r\ncultivating farther East. There was no twitch-grass, wild mustard,\r\nor purslane. After many years of deep plowing and crop rotation, the\r\nfields of this part of the corn-belt were comparatively free of weeds.\r\nOnly on land that had been allowed to lie fallow were the weeds a pest.\r\n\r\nThe fields of Sunnyside Farm must be greatly improved before Hiram\r\ncould, however, take up the local methods of corn growing in every\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nHe knew of no improving crop better suited to his needs than crimson\r\nclover. It is rich in nitrogen, makes a heavy crop of hay before\r\ncorn-planting time, and it could be sowed at the last cultivation of\r\nthe present corn crop.\r\n\r\nThe drawback was that it necessitated the cutting of the corn to the\r\nground and the removal of the shocks from the field. On the better\r\nfarms near by the corn was allowed to cure on the standing stalk and\r\nthen the cattle and hogs were turned in to graze on the fodder, the\r\nstalks being knocked down and cut up by the disc harrow before plowing\r\nin the spring.\r\n\r\nThat was another method Hiram could not adopt. If his clover catch was\r\nworth anything at all he did not want the corn stalks mixed with it\r\nat hay-making time. He talked the matter over with Mr. Bronson, and\r\na machine was secured at harvesting time that, drawn by one of the\r\nPercherons, went through the field cutting two rows of corn at a time\r\nand giving the two men working with it all they could do shocking the\r\ncorn at proper intervals.\r\n\r\nThis corn finished curing in the shock and the husking was done at the\r\nbarn where the fodder was stacked against the increasing need of the\r\nherd of young stock that Mr. Bronson was continually adding to.\r\n\r\nThis method of harvesting cost more in time and labor than Hiram could\r\nhave desired; but it left his fields clean and gave the young clover a\r\nbetter chance.\r\n\r\nThe corn he had obtained from Daniel Brown proved to be all that Hiram\r\nhad hoped it would be. That which he had raised for seed was so evenly\r\nmatured and sound in the ear that Mr. Bronson admitted it was by far\r\nthe most satisfactory variety Hiram had tried. And how it did mount up\r\nin the cribs with its glossy red and yellow grains!\r\n\r\nThe wheat thrashing had yielded Hiram not more than sixteen to eighteen\r\nbushels to the acre--scarcely a paying investment. But it was all\r\nprofit for Mr. Bronson, as the crop had been planted when he bought the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nHiram knew well enough where the fault lay. The land was not strong\r\nenough for wheat, and he proposed to plant but a small acreage to that\r\ngrain for the next season.\r\n\r\n\"Oats will pay us better, I believe. Some of this upland can be plowed\r\nearly in the spring, and as soon as the oats are off we'll disc and\r\nput in cowpeas, turning them under for the corn crop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ow!\" ejaculated his employer, \"do you mean to plow under both the oat\r\nstubble and the peas for the corn?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you want corn--real corn,\" the young fellow told him. \"This land is\r\npoverty stricken. And give me all the cattle you can find, Mr. Bronson.\r\nI'll manage to feed them somehow or other.\"\r\n\r\nThe ensilage crop demanded his attention and the labor of all the hands\r\nfor the better part of a week. Even Mr. Turner had been forced to\r\nconfess that _something_ had happened to that twenty acres of Sunnyside\r\nalong the county road that heretofore had yielded such poor crops.\r\nSince Hiram's underdraining scheme had gone into effect the soil seemed\r\nentirely different. The corn and cowpeas had grown like a rank swamp.\r\nWhen cut and carted to the shredder it was so heavy it was all a man\r\ncould do to lift a forkful.\r\n\r\nIt was not particularly hard to load the wagon in the field; getting\r\nthe ensilage off the cart was the more difficult part of the job.\r\n\r\nA brief experience taught the young farm manager something. He unhung\r\nthe wagon and put the low wheels behind and the big wheels in front.\r\nWith side racks spread at a wide angle and chains front and rear to\r\nhold the racks, they were enabled to pile an enormous load upon the\r\nsloping wagon body.\r\n\r\nThe Percherons could pull all the ensilage the men could pile on. When\r\ndrawn to the shredder all that was needed was to unfasten the chains at\r\nfront and rear and draw the wagon out from under the load.\r\n\r\nThis was quick work and kept the crew at the shredder busy all the\r\ntime. The ensilage was blown into the silo as rapidly as it was\r\nshredded, and at the end of the week the huge tank was filled.\r\n\r\nHiram at once had the twenty-acre piece broadcasted with stable manure,\r\nand as the heavy crop of corn and peas had kept the soil comparatively\r\nmoist it was plowed much easier than might have been expected after the\r\nAugust drought. At wheat planting Hiram used a good fertilizer in the\r\ndrill and set the sprouts to run about a bushel and a half rather than\r\na bushel and a peck to the acre.\r\n\r\nThis he did save on the lower four acres next to Yancey Battick's\r\nplace. This patch was considered by both Mr. Bronson and Battick the\r\nbest soil for experiment with the new wheat, and Battick planted the\r\nwonderful new grain himself, using a hand-sower and sowing only three\r\npecks to the acre.\r\n\r\nThe new wheat plant proved to stool so heavily that Battick claimed\r\nthe field would be quite as well covered in the spring as the rest of\r\nthe twenty acres. Hiram had observed the stooling property of the new\r\nwheat; but he had some doubt about its being well to sow the grain so\r\nthinly. He feared it would not furnish sufficient protection for the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nBut as this crop was for seed rather than for bulk of grain, it might\r\nbe all right. In any case the young farmer watched the experiment with\r\nmuch interest.\r\n\r\nLong before Thanksgiving the farm work was pretty well cleared up.\r\nHiram kept only Orrin and the boy, Jim Larry, to help him do the winter\r\nchores. The three of them could feed the cattle, draw out the stable\r\nmanure and spread it on the corn land which he would first plow in the\r\nearly spring, and do the other necessary winter work.\r\n\r\nThe house had been long since finished, although the interior had not\r\nbeen decorated, as Mr. Bronson wished to wait for the house to settle.\r\nIt was otherwise ready for occupancy and there was a heating plant in\r\nthe cellar. Hiram and the boys moved into the house when the weather\r\nbecame severe and started the furnace. Mr. Bronson furnished some\r\nnecessities in the way of cots and warm blankets, and the three were\r\nvery comfortable.\r\n\r\nMiss Delia Pringle insisted upon coming over on frequent occasions and\r\n\"ridding up\" for them.\r\n\r\n\"For, talk as you will, men-folks ain't fitted by nature to be good\r\nhousekeepers. For the land's sake! I remember once my mother and I\r\nwent away from home for a time and left father alone, and when we came\r\nback we couldn't tell for the mess there was whether it was father or\r\nthe dog that had lived in the kitchen. I am sure of one thing--the\r\ndog-kennel was a long sight the cleanest!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Pringle was anxious to have another dance in the new house at\r\nSunnyside; but Hiram did not like to ask Mr. Bronson for permission.\r\nThere were certain rough fellows in the neighborhood who Hiram believed\r\nhad helped Adam Banks loose Turner's bull on the occasion of the former\r\ndance. Besides, Ad Banks himself was at home again for the winter.\r\n\r\nWhat the fellow had been doing about Sunnyside at the time of the\r\ntornado in June, Hiram had never discovered. He certainly had not\r\nremained at home for long on that occasion. Yancey Battick was not at\r\nall convinced that Banks had not come straight from Loomisville for the\r\nexpress purpose of burning his stack of wheat. Battick still clung to\r\nthe belief that the men who had stolen his Mortgage Lifter Oats had\r\ninformation of the new wheat, and were determined to ruin his chances\r\nof raising a crop of it for seed if they could do so. Adam Banks would\r\nbe a perfect instrument to their hands, he declared, and he felt that\r\nBanks must be watched closely.\r\n\r\nHowever this might be, Hiram did not wish to tempt the ne'er-do-well\r\nto try any further tricks about Sunnyside Farm. Hiram, with Orrin and\r\nJim Larry, were always on the keen lookout for Adam Banks. Orrin, by\r\nthis time, was in good health and quite able to defend himself in\r\nany case. His ability to work well and his willingness pleased Hiram\r\nimmeasurably. If only the fellow was not so secretive about his past!\r\nHiram knew little more about Orrin Post now than he had when he found\r\nhim in the calf shed, eight or nine months before.\r\n\r\nOrrin in all this time had never mentioned his family, his friends,\r\nwhere he was born, or what his circumstances had been before he came to\r\nSunnyside Farm. His having been driven away by his former employer when\r\nhe was taken ill, was positively all the information he had vouchsafed.\r\n\r\nHiram had learned that he had come through Pringleton the day he had\r\narrived at Sunnyside. Previous to such arrival, however, Orrin Post's\r\nlife was a total blank to the young farm manager.\r\n\r\nHiram did not believe that Orrin's previous life had been a happy\r\nexistence. It might be even that he had had trouble with the police,\r\nand for that reason was so close-mouthed. Nevertheless, Hiram kept such\r\nthoughts as this to himself. For his own part he accepted Orrin Post at\r\nhis face value.\r\n\r\nThe three young fellows at Sunnyside used the kitchen to cook and eat\r\nin, set up their cots in the dining room, and occasionally on a rainy\r\nday or on Sunday sat in the parlor, where they could watch the road\r\nthrough the broad windows.\r\n\r\nThey were doing this last on one dripping Sunday afternoon, when Jim\r\nspied a vehicle coming up the hill from the direction of Battick's and\r\nPringleton. He did not identify the horses or the man driving them.\r\n\r\n\"Stranger in this neighborhood,\" he announced. \"That fellow driving has\r\ngot a bushel of whiskers on his face. Did you ever see the like?\"\r\n\r\nHiram was reading and did not even get up to look out. Orrin, however,\r\nexamined the approaching turnout at some length, but he made no comment\r\nand finally drifted out of the room. Hiram heard him open and close\r\nthe back door just as Jim exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Hey! Old Whiskers is stopping here. He's waving his whip and calling.\r\nWhat do you suppose he wants, Mr. Strong?\"\r\n\r\nHiram put down his book. \"The best way to find out is to ask him,\" he\r\nsaid laughing, and rose to go to the front door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                              AN INQUIRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rain dripped from the porch roof and a curtain of drizzle fell\r\nbetween the house and the gate where the gray horses stood. The\r\nbewhiskered individual had a rubber blanket over his knees and the\r\nwater dripped from the brim of his hat into his lap--just as it dripped\r\nfrom the roof over Hiram Strong's head.\r\n\r\nOn the back seat of the old-fashioned carryall sat a second man. But\r\nHiram could not see him very well at first.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" yelled the bewhiskered man, \"you ain't all deaf in there, are\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not all of us,\" replied Hiram. \"I still have my hearing unimpaired.\r\nBut 'hay' is for horses. It doesn't mean much to me. What do you want?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the man in the rear seat of the vehicle thrust forward his\r\nhead. He wore spectacles and was evidently no farmer. He demanded:\r\n\r\n\"Have you any information of, or do you know anything personally\r\nabout, Theodore, or Teddy, Chester, or a man calling himself by such\r\nname?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never heard of him,\" declared Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"He is supposed to have come this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might say that lots of people drive this way--especially in summer.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would probably have been walking,\" said the bespectacled man\r\nconfidently.\r\n\r\n\"Not many strangers walk by here, I admit.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if he came this way--as seems probable--it was months ago. Early\r\nlast spring, to be more exact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" laughed Hiram, \"I would not be likely to remember anybody who\r\npassed here so long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose he asked for work?\" put in the bearded driver of the carryall.\r\n\"He'd be likely to. Ted wasn't lazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may remember the men who asked you for work last season?\" repeated\r\nthe more professional looking man with emphasis.\r\n\r\nHiram began to think this man was a lawyer. An inquiry of importance\r\nwas being made, and he grew interested. He put his head back into the\r\nhouse door and asked Jim Larry to get his umbrella. In a moment, when\r\nthe boy had brought it, Hiram went out to the carriage to discuss the\r\nmatter more at his ease.\r\n\r\n\"You do remember the fellow, hey?\" asked the bearded man, his little\r\nblue eyes sparkling. \"I bet you do!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't say 'yes' or 'no' so easily,\" laughed Hiram. \"When was it the\r\nman was supposed to come this way?\"\r\n\r\nThe man on the rear seat of the carryall gave a date. It was well back\r\nin the spring.\r\n\r\n\"It was after that date--soon after, we believe. We know almost\r\npositively that he came through Pringleton and was heading this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heading for Sunnyside?\" asked Hiram in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the name of this place? I don't mean to say that he was coming\r\nto this particular farm. Only that he was walking in this direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Hiram, who had been trying to think of the incidents of\r\nthe previous spring, \"I don't know that there were many tramping people\r\nwho asked me for work at that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you run this farm--a kid like you?\" demanded the bewhiskered one in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Hiram said with his customary smile, \"I try to. I would know\r\nif anybody came along asking for work. And at that time I was having\r\nditching done and hired almost every man I could get.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about Ted doing ditching,\" said the driver of the\r\ncarryall. \"He was a notch above that.\"\r\n\r\n\"At that season of the year I presume a farm worker is not likely to\r\nhave his pick of jobs,\" the other man suggested shrewdly.\r\n\r\n\"I feel almost sure I would have remembered anybody who came here and\r\nwhom I did not hire if he really wanted work at that time,\" said the\r\nyoung farm manager thoughtfully. \"But there was nobody by that name.\"\r\n\r\n\"He might not have given you that name,\" the legal looking man said\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Post knew him by that name,\" continued the gentleman, indicating\r\nthe driver.\r\n\r\nHiram was shocked to sudden and keen attention. But he controlled his\r\nfeatures. He asked, after a moment, as though he had been thinking:\r\n\r\n\"What did this Theodore Chester look like?\"\r\n\r\nHere the bearded individual answered. The other man did not seem so\r\nfamiliar with the lost one's personality as was the driver of the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n\"Tell you, he wasn't much to look at. Kind of slimpsy lookin'. Lean\r\nlike. But he could work. Had a sleight with him about most things.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not giving the young man a very clear description\r\nof--er--Ted,\" interrupted the legal looking man. \"What color are his\r\neyes and his hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, his eyes are sort o' blue, or blue-gray, and his hair is brownish.\r\nLeastways, I should say it was. And he had kind of crinkly wrinkles\r\nabout his eyes when he laughed--\"\r\n\r\n\"How old was the man?\" interrupted Hiram quickly.\r\n\r\n\"He is twenty-three years old this very month,\" replied the man from\r\nthe back seat of the carryall.\r\n\r\n\"He looks older,\" said the bewhiskered farmer.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, you have no photograph of him?\" asked Hiram slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Wish I had!\" exclaimed the other man. \"I would plaster this whole\r\ncountry with reproductions of it if I had one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes? Well,\" said Hiram, \"I do not know any such man. At least, I do\r\nnot remember any such asking me for work or passing this farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" sighed the bewhiskered man, and took up his reins.\r\n\r\n\"If you should ever see such a person let me hear about it, will you?\"\r\nasked the other quickly, and thrust his hand into the rain with a card\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n\"What did he do?\" asked Hiram as the gray horses started.\r\n\r\n\"He ran away from me, young fellow,\" the bearded man said shortly and\r\ngrimly, and the carryall rolled away.\r\n\r\nHiram looked at the card. It read: \"Eben Craddock, Attorney at Law,\"\r\nwith an address in a Cincinnati office building.\r\n\r\n\"Odd thing,\" muttered Hiram, slipping the card into his pocket. He went\r\nback to the house, leaving the umbrella on the porch to drip. He went\r\nin and found that Jim Larry seemed to have followed Orrin out through\r\nthe rear door.\r\n\r\nHe sat down and picked up his book again; but he could not fix his mind\r\non the story he had been reading. That bearded man's name was Post and\r\nthe young man of twenty-three had run away from him.\r\n\r\nThe date the lawyer had mentioned as that on which the fugitive\r\nwas supposed to have come through Pringleton was the very day--he\r\nremembered it now--on the evening of which he had found Orrin so ill\r\nand helpless in the calf pen here on Sunnyside Farm!\r\n\r\nThis was a good deal of a nut to crack--and it was a meaty nut when\r\nHiram Strong had cracked it. However, both the man named Post and the\r\nlawyer had refused to give any details of why they were hunting the\r\nmysterious individual called \"Theodore Chester.\" If he was a fugitive\r\nand a criminal why had they been so secretive?\r\n\r\n\"I have the lawyer's card. Somehow I don't trust that fellow with the\r\nwhiskers at all,\" muttered Hiram. \"And I've know Orrin more than eight\r\nmonths, and know nothing but good of him.\"\r\n\r\nSo he said nothing regarding the inquiry for Theodore Chester to either\r\nof his companions. As for Orrin, he did not appear again at the house\r\nuntil dark.\r\n\r\nFor some reason hard to explain Hiram was willing to take a chance on\r\nOrrin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                                SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram knew that Lettie Bronson, after all, had her way with her father\r\nand that before the summer was over she had made him take her to one of\r\nthe lake shore resorts where she met just the class of girls whom she\r\nhad associated with at St. Beris. Since they had returned to Plympton,\r\nand during harvest and afterward, Miss Lettie had been to Sunnyside but\r\nseldom.\r\n\r\nNow that winter had come and Hiram Strong had some free hours, he\r\nbegan, as any other healthy and normal young fellow would, to long for\r\nsome society besides that of his two comrades on the farm and Yancey\r\nBattick.\r\n\r\nEven Delia Pringle did not furnish all the \"ladies' society\" Hiram\r\ncraved. And for some weeks about the only time he saw a girl was when\r\nhe and Orrin hitched up Jerry and went to church on a Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nBut he was not entirely forgotten by his employer's daughter. That fact\r\nbecame apparent the very day after the bewhiskered farmer and the\r\nlawyer searching for \"Theodore Chester\" had stopped at Sunnyside Farm.\r\nThe postman brought Hiram a dainty envelope in which was an equally\r\ndainty missive in Lettie's rigid, upright handwriting.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm little note--not at all the ordinary staid invitation to\r\nan evening party--and for a long time Hiram kept it in the bottom of\r\nhis handkerchief box where some scent lay.\r\n\r\nSister's letters, which now came with fortnightly regularity, he kept\r\ntoo. But he did not hide them under the flowered silk lining of his\r\nhandkerchief box.\r\n\r\nThe party at the Bronson house was to be--as Hiram supposed--rather\r\na dressy affair. He had already prepared for it. He had sent his\r\nmeasurements as the advertised instructions directed to a catalogue\r\nhouse in Chicago and from there in due season arrived a \"full tailored\"\r\ndress suit. It fitted fairly well; but of course it was a block pattern\r\ngarment, fitted with the tailor's \"goose\" rather than to Hiram's\r\nmeasurements. It fairly shrieked \"ready made!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll knock their eye out, Mr. Strong,\" declared Jim Larry, as Hiram\r\nappeared dressed for the revel, kid gloves and all.\r\n\r\nHiram hoped he looked as good as Jim's enthusiasm suggested; but\r\nsomehow he had his doubts. Besides Orrin, who had harnessed Jerry to\r\nthe run-about for him and handed Hiram the reins after he got in the\r\ncarriage, only said:\r\n\r\n\"Hope you have a good time, Strong. My regards to the Bronsons.\"\r\n\r\nOrrin did not say a word about how fine Hiram looked in his new\r\nplumage. The young fellow began to feel a trifle anxious. He knew he\r\nfelt uncomfortable. If by any chance he looked as bad as he felt--\r\n\r\nHe drove down to Plympton in rather high fettle, however, arriving at\r\nthe Bronson house at the edge of town just as it was getting dark. The\r\nplace was not lit up and there seemed to be few arrivals. First he\r\nwondered if he had mistaken the evening. Then he wondered if anything\r\nhad happened--anything serious to Lettie or her father--and the party\r\nhad been postponed.\r\n\r\nHe drove in by the side lane to the broad yard at the back. One of the\r\nstablemen came out with a lantern and recognized Jerry.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Hullo! You're from Sunnyside, aren't you? Come down to help us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Help you do what?\" Hiram asked climbing down from the carriage rather\r\nstiffly, for it was a cold night.\r\n\r\n\"Help us look after the teams and show 'em where to park their\r\njitneys,\" said the man carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"Not to-night,\" Hiram replied soberly. \"I've been invited to the party.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew! All right, me lord!\" chuckled the stableman. \"But there's\r\nnothing doing in the party line for an hour or more yet. Did you come\r\nso early because you were afraid they'd eat up all the cake and drink\r\nall the grapejuice on you?\"\r\n\r\nHiram did not answer this gibe. He walked around the cold streets for\r\ntwo hours before he ventured back to the Bronson house.\r\n\r\nThen he found that the company had arrived with a rush. He was directed\r\nto the men's coat room on the second floor. It was filled with men and\r\nmost of them--at least those who appeared quite grown-up--were in dress\r\nsuits. A glance assured the observant Hiram his own garments were not\r\naltogether in the mode.\r\n\r\nThese fellows' coats fitted them as sleek as a cat's hide! Hiram knew\r\nthat his garments wrinkled or bagged. After having his overcoat on so\r\nlong and sitting in the carriage, his new dress suit needed pressing.\r\nThe tailor's goose might have helped some at this juncture.\r\n\r\nHe saw more than one curious glance cast in his direction. But he was\r\nin for it, and Hiram Strong had suffered a searing of his pride before.\r\nHe knew how to stand the gaff.\r\n\r\nAt the wide entrance to the drawing room Lettie was standing with her\r\nfather to greet the guests. She carried an immense bouquet of hothouse\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\"Hiram! How glad I am to see you,\" she said, very kindly.\r\n\r\nBut at once the young farmer realized that she seemed looking over his\r\nshoulder as though in search of somebody else. Hiram stood aside, but\r\nthere was nobody in the doorway. Lettie asked:\r\n\r\n\"Isn't he with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" Hiram queried.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Post--Orrin Post. Didn't he come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why Lettie! I didn't know he was invited. You didn't expect me to\r\nbring Orrin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought he would come with you, Hiram. I invited him.\"\r\n\r\nHiram felt momentarily relieved. He shook his head, however, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I surely did not know anything about that. Orrin did not mention it to\r\nme. Are you sure--?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sent him an invitation,\" Lettie said, pouting. \"He is such a nice\r\ndancer. I am disappointed, Hiram.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he did not reply to you at all?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head firmly. She was very pretty in her party dress and\r\nwith her hair \"done up\" for almost the first time that Hiram had seen\r\nit so. Lettie seemed quite grown up indeed.\r\n\r\n\"It must be that Orrin did not receive your invitation. He surely would\r\nhave mentioned it. We talked about this party a good deal,\" said Hiram\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\nLettie had been looking Hiram over, and now she was smiling a little,\r\ntoo. The young farm manager wondered if her amusement was not aroused\r\nby his ill-fitting suit. His gloves were uncomfortable, too. One of\r\nthem had begun to split!\r\n\r\n\"How did you send the invitation to him?\" Hiram asked hurriedly, trying\r\nto cover his own embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"By mail. Just as I did yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is strange, then,\" Hiram said. \"I am sorry, and I am sure Orrin\r\nwould have loved to come. Are there any other folks on our R. F. D.\r\nroute named Post?\"\r\n\r\n\"I just directed it to him at Pringleton. I didn't even put 'Sunnyside\r\nFarm' on the letter. I didn't address yours any differently, Hiram.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But the mail carrier knows me all right. I--I don't believe Orrin\r\nhas received or written a letter since he has been with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Doesn't he have any friends at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't seem to,\" replied Hiram, making room for another arrival then.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson welcomed him warmly; but of course he gave his time mostly\r\nto the older people who came to the party. Hiram found himself alone\r\nfor the most part. He knew very few people here in Plympton, and almost\r\nnone of the younger set.\r\n\r\nHe found himself with a group of older men who largely talked farming\r\nor politics. It looked as if he would have a dull evening, and Hiram\r\nwished more than once during the first hour that he had not come.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if Orrin had received an invitation but had been wise\r\nenough to remain away from the Bronsons' party. It was queer!\r\n\r\nThen Lettie was kind enough to hunt Hiram out and give him a dance on\r\nher list. The dance was informal and there were no cards, and the girls\r\nseemed just as likely to ask the young men for a dance as _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nNo other girl gave Hiram the opportunity to dance, however, having\r\nseen him on the floor with Lettie. That awkwardly fitting dress suit\r\ncertainly made a show of him.\r\n\r\nHiram apprehended more than one giggling comment as he turned about the\r\nroom with Lettie. She offered to dance with him again later, but he\r\ntold her he thought he should go home early--it was such a long drive\r\nback to Sunnyside Farm.\r\n\r\nThis was rather cowardly on his part. Yet he felt that he could not let\r\nthe girl, out of the kindness of her heart, make a further exhibition\r\non the floor of herself with him.\r\n\r\nThe young farm manager kept out of Lettie's way as much as possible for\r\nthe rest of the evening. And he did go home early.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you enjoyed yourself, Hi,\" said Mr. Bronson, when the boy bade\r\nhim good-bye. \"Seems to me I didn't see you dancing much. Don't you\r\ncare for it? Too sensible, I bet!\"\r\n\r\nHis employer's cordiality was not to be doubted. Lettie seemed just as\r\nsweet to him as she could be. Yet Hiram was glad when he was jogging\r\nback to the farm behind Jerry. Society was not a condition in which\r\nHiram Strong could shine.\r\n\r\nThe next time he had occasion to drive to Pringleton the young manager\r\nof Sunnyside Farm went to the post office for a special purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Is there any letter here for Mr. Orrin Post?\" he asked the young woman\r\nwho presided over the local mail.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Strong!\" she exclaimed, \"you don't take the Posts' mail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't I take Orrin Post's letters--if he has any?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because Orrin Post lives clear down at the other end of Number Three\r\nroute--almost fifteen miles east of the town. And you don't look\r\nanything like Orrin Post,\" she added, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Don't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has heaps and heaps of whiskers,\" laughed the young woman. \"And\r\nthere is no other Orrin Post that I know of.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a man working for me by that name,\" Hiram said seriously.\r\n\r\n\"Then you must tell him to be sure to have his correspondents put\r\n'Sunnyside Farm' on their envelopes addressed to him,\" was the advice\r\nof the postmistress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                          A VISIT AND A PEST\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the disappointment Hiram Strong experienced regarding the\r\nparty at the Bronson house in Plympton, the winter did not pass without\r\nsome entertainment--and of a kind which he really enjoyed better than\r\nhe had Lettie's party.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas holidays ushered in a series of barn dances, surprise\r\nparties, straw rides and other country social functions organized in\r\nthe Pringleton district and mostly of a nature that assured a pleasant\r\ntime and plenty of clean fun.\r\n\r\nHiram and Orrin and Jim Larry attended most of these entertainments.\r\nBut Hiram hid away his dress suit and never wore it again. After a\r\nwhile his comrades on Sunnyside Farm ceased to gibe at him about the\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\nHiram had never asked Orrin about the invitation he might have received\r\nto the Bronsons' party. He shrank from arousing any suspicions in\r\nOrrin's mind that he, Hiram, was suspicious of him.\r\n\r\nBut the young farm manager believed Lettie Bronson's note to the young\r\nman they both knew as \"Orrin Post\" had gone to the real Orrin Post--the\r\nbewhiskered farmer who had driven through the neighborhood with Eben\r\nCraddock, the lawyer from Cincinnati, looking for the mysterious\r\n\"Theodore Chester.\"\r\n\r\nWas Hiram's assistant here at Sunnyside the individual that had run\r\naway from Post, the farmer, who lived fifteen miles east of Pringleton?\r\nIf so, why had the young fellow given Hiram his former employer's name\r\nas his own?\r\n\r\nAnd then, searching his mind for the details of that long-past\r\nincident, Hiram remembered that the sick young fellow when Hiram found\r\nhim in the calf shed had been delirious. He had given his name as\r\n\"Orrin Post\" without realizing, perhaps, what he was doing or saying.\r\nHe had uttered the first name that had come into his mind--the name of\r\nthe farmer who had treated him so harshly by driving him out of his\r\nhouse when he was taken ill.\r\n\r\nHiram was quite convinced that there was no criminal charge against the\r\nyoung man he knew as Orrin Post. It was surely no misdemeanor for a man\r\ntwenty-three years old to run away from his employer! It was evident\r\nthat neither the bewhiskered man nor the lawyer were willing to accuse\r\nthe man they called \"Theodore Chester\" of any particular wrongdoing.\r\nThe circumstances remained a mystery.\r\n\r\nWhenever Miss Delia Pringle had anything to do with getting up a party\r\nthat winter Hiram, Orrin and Jim Larry were of course invited. Indeed\r\nthey were practically her right hand men.\r\n\r\nMiss Pringle frankly admired Orrin, treated Hiram as though she had\r\nknown him all his life, and could not keep from hugging the fresh-faced\r\nand grinning Jim if he chanced to sit next to her on a straw ride or in\r\nany other free-and-easy assembly.\r\n\r\nYancey Battick once remarked to Hiram, and with vast disapproval: \"They\r\ncan't come too young for Delia. She'd rob the cradle, she would!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're unfair to Miss Pringle, Mr. Battick,\" Hiram told him. \"She is\r\nthe best-hearted girl around here.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Girl!_\" snorted Battick, with emphasis.\r\n\r\nIt was in January that something happened to Yancey Battick that\r\nwas bound to change that misanthrope's attitude toward most of the\r\nworld, and should have changed it particularly toward Miss Pringle.\r\nAll through the winter up to that time, Battick could have been seen\r\nfrequently walking about the lower end of the wheat field where his new\r\nseed was planted. That he apprehended trouble at almost any time he\r\nfrankly admitted to Hiram.\r\n\r\nSometimes in the middle of the night, or when the boys came home late\r\nafter some party, or very early in the morning when they got up for\r\nsome special purpose at Sunnyside Farm, they would see the spark of a\r\nwandering lantern down at that end of the twenty-acre lot. Battick was\r\nroaming about on the lookout for trouble.\r\n\r\nJust what the man expected to happen to the dormant wheat plants, in\r\nmid-winter, Hiram could not imagine. But it was a fact that going out\r\nat all hours of the night and in all kinds of weather brought its own\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nBattick lived so much like a hermit anyway that had it not been for\r\nHiram's interest in him, the man might never have seen spring again\r\nand the revival of his wonderful wheat. One day the young farm manager\r\nsuddenly remembered that he had not seen or heard from Battick for at\r\nleast three days.\r\n\r\nThe thought somewhat startled him; yet he started along the county road\r\ntoward the old Pringle place with no real fear that Battick was in\r\ntrouble. When he mounted the low steps to the rickety front porch where\r\nhe had taken refuge from the rain the first night he had come to this\r\nneighborhood, Hiram was startled by hearing a faint cry from inside the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"Hi!\" he shouted. \"That you, Mr. Battick?\"\r\n\r\nThere followed another murmuring cry. Hiram put his hand on the knob of\r\nthe door and rattled it. The door, of course, was locked. But he heard\r\nthe pleading call again. This was no time for etiquette. Nor did he\r\nworry about Battick's gun.\r\n\r\n\"It's I, Mr. Battick! Hiram Strong!\" he shouted, and then threw his\r\nshoulder against the door. The frail bar to his entrance gave way\r\nimmediately. He was almost catapulted into the room.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" he cried seeing nobody in the living room of the house.\r\n\r\n\"I'm down, Mr. Strong,\" croaked Battick's voice from the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"For pity's sake! what is the matter?\" demanded the boy, and hurried to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nBattick was stretched upon his bed, covered in his blankets and shaking\r\nwith a chill. He could scarcely speak above a whisper and his face was\r\nfiery-red with fever.\r\n\r\nHiram was deft in attending the sick. He had shown that at the time\r\nOrrin Post had first come to Sunnyside. He made Battick as comfortable\r\nas possible, leaving drinking water beside him, and then hurried back\r\nup the hill. His first thought was to hitch up Jerry and go for a\r\ndoctor. He believed the man was in a bad way.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered that Miss Pringle had a telephone. In addition, the\r\nspinster was famous as a nurse. Hiram knew that Yancey Battick was in\r\nneed of nursing as well as of medical attention.\r\n\r\n\"I expect he will give me fits when he gets well for letting Miss\r\nPringle into his house, he hates her so,\" thought Hiram. \"But if I was\r\nto be sick that way myself, and could not get Mother Atterson to nurse\r\nme, I'd be mighty glad to get Miss Pringle as the next best nurse.\"\r\n\r\nSo he did not stop at Sunnyside but went on to Miss Pringle's and told\r\nhis story. Almost immediately the spinster was at the telephone and\r\ncalling up Doctor Marble. Abigail Wentworth scurried around to pack a\r\nbasket with the things Delia thought she might need.\r\n\r\n\"You won't be let in. You'll be put out like you were before,\" declared\r\nAbigail in her sputtering way. \"That Yance Battick will work some magic\r\non you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Miss Pringle.\r\n\r\n\"Yance Battick has got the evil eye,\" declared Abigail with confidence.\r\n\r\n\"He's got pneumonia, I shouldn't wonder,\" snapped Miss Pringle. \"I'll\r\nbe glad when Doctor Marble comes. Are you going back with me, Hiram?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly am, Delia,\" said the young farm manager. \"And if he tries\r\nto send you home, I won't let him.\"\r\n\r\nBut when they got down to the old Pringle homestead Battick was too\r\ndeep in delirium to recognize Miss Pringle. When Dr. Marble arrived\r\nhe declared that Hiram had found the man and given the alarm none too\r\nsoon, if he was to be saved.\r\n\r\nIt was a fight to keep Battick from slipping over the Border. Hiram,\r\nor Orrin, or Jim Larry was at the house all the time. Miss Pringle\r\nremained night and day. Other neighbors showed an interest in the queer\r\nman and Mr. Bronson sent up everything that might be needed and which\r\nBattick and his neighbors might not possess when he became convalescent.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson had been over-urged again by Lettie, and they were going to\r\nFlorida for the season.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, if anything happens to Battick--if he dies--let me know by\r\ntelegraph,\" Mr. Bronson told Hiram. \"Being his partner in that wheat\r\ngrowing deal gives me a personal interest in the poor fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And me, too,\" agreed Hiram. \"I will look out for him--and for the\r\nwheat too.\"\r\n\r\nBattick did not wholly forget his precious wheat, and the day after\r\nHiram had found him so ill he recognized the young farmer and earnestly\r\nbegged him to bring the remaining seed of the new wheat into his\r\nbedroom and hang it in a bag above the foot of the bed where Battick\r\ncould see it.\r\n\r\n\"If anything should happen to that in the ground,\" the sick man\r\nwhispered, \"I'd still have a chance.\"\r\n\r\nBut the wheat in the ground--not only Yancey Battick's but all the\r\nwheat on Sunnyside, gave promise of good growth when the spring should\r\nopen. There was some snow for a cover during the coldest weather; but\r\nmost of the storms were of rain and wind. Hiram was growing hungry for\r\nthe spring. He watched anxiously for the earliest moment when he could\r\nget the plow into the ground for oats.\r\n\r\nBattick was convalescing when this first plowing began. Miss Pringle\r\nhad ministered to him so faithfully that, crank though he was, the\r\nhermit could but speak well of her at last. Yet--\r\n\r\n\"She is a nuisance to have around--all women are,\" he grumbled to\r\nHiram. \"She's cleaned and scoured this room--even my workbench--till\r\nI know I can't find half my things. There isn't anything in its right\r\nplace. But she has nursed me faithfully and won't take a cent's pay--\"\r\n\r\n\"Great goodness, man! you didn't offer her money?\" Hiram gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she did not take it,\" muttered Battick.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder I met her just now going up the road crying. Is that all\r\nthe sense you have? Or gratitude? Or _anything_?\" completed Hiram with\r\ngreat disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Hoity-toity, young man!\" Battick said weakly. \"Do you realize that I\r\nam much older than you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't act so,\" snapped the young farm manager. \"I can't respect\r\nanybody who throws away the very heart of the nut and eats the husk.\r\nYou are determined, it seems, to make all your neighbors dislike you.\r\nIf I were Delia Pringle I'd never step inside your house again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know that I shall ask her,\" muttered Battick.\r\n\r\nAt that Hiram marched out himself. He knew very well that the man did\r\nnot mean what he said; he was still sick and weak enough to quarrel\r\nwith everybody--even his best friends.\r\n\r\nHiram was too busy just then to give the crotchety man much attention;\r\nand thereafter he knew that Miss Pringle sent a neighbor's boy down to\r\nBattick's with the dainties she cooked for him. She did not go near the\r\nold homestead.\r\n\r\nAnother team of Percherons and a double plow came to Sunnyside to help\r\nin the plowing and oat sowing. They got on the land just as soon as\r\nthe horses would not mire. But there was much of even the higher fields\r\nthat Hiram wished might be tiled properly to make the soil more friable.\r\n\r\nThey drilled the oats and then went about the other spring\r\nwork--cleaning the stables and calf pens and drawing out all the\r\nfertilizer the cattle had made to the early corn land. There was now\r\nmore than sixty head of young stock on the farm and Hiram intended to\r\ngrain a dozen or more for market.\r\n\r\nBut the silo was empty and most of the corn fodder had been picked over\r\nand trampled in the cattle yards. What hay he had left Hiram needed for\r\nthe horses. It was still three months and a half till haying time, and\r\nSunnyside did not yield any too much hay, in any case.\r\n\r\nThe promise of the crimson clover was encouraging, however; and it\r\nwould make the earliest of pasture. Therefore he turned the cattle into\r\na ten-acre piece below the barns and let them graze there before the\r\nregular pasture at the far end of the farm was grown.\r\n\r\nThe stock went pretty nearly crazy over the first few mouthfuls of\r\nclover, bawling and running about rather than settling down to eating.\r\nBut after a few hours they spread out and went quietly to grazing.\r\n\r\nUntil mid-May they found plenty to do on this patch of fast-growing\r\nclover; but of course Hiram could not cut that for hay. He put the plow\r\ninto it as soon as the cattle were driven to the regular pasture. They\r\nhad enriched it considerably and the roots and stubble of the clover\r\nheld plenty of nitrogen. He knew the soil was in good condition now for\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nThe fields that had lain fallow over winter were already plowed and\r\nplanted. This year Hiram was following the local custom and planting\r\nin the row and would use the large horse-hoes for cultivating. The\r\nearly cornfields had received during the winter a heavy dressing of\r\nmanure and all the other cornfields--save those that now had growing\r\nwheat upon them--would either have clover sod to turn under or an\r\neighteen-inch growth of cowpeas.\r\n\r\nHiram claimed that his cornfields this year would be well enriched in\r\none way or another.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson had returned with Lettie from Florida. He brought Lettie up\r\nto Sunnyside in his car on several occasions; but although the girl was\r\nchatty and kind, both to Hiram and Orrin Post, to the mind of the first\r\nnamed there was something lacking in her manner. She seemed bored and\r\ndissatisfied. In her usual frank fashion Miss Pringle commented upon\r\nthe change in Lettie since she had first met her.\r\n\r\n\"Land's sake, Hiram! that girl is certainly getting her nose in the\r\nair. Not that I mean she's spoiled, but she ain't the same as she was.\r\nThis taking her around from one flashy place to another is making her a\r\nregular flibbertigibbet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever that is,\" laughed Hiram.\r\n\r\nBut he recognized the truth of Delia's homely statement. Since Yancey\r\nBattick's illness Hiram and the spinster had become even firmer friends\r\nthan before. Miss Pringle was shrewd enough to see that Hiram was\r\nenamored of Lettie Bronson. But there were other interests Hiram had\r\nthat Miss Pringle knew about.\r\n\r\nLong before this time she had not only heard all about Sister, but she\r\nhad begun a correspondence with the little girl back in Scoville and\r\nwith Mother Atterson. She could tell those loved ones \"back home\" more\r\nabout Hiram and his affairs than the youth himself would have been\r\nwilling to write about.\r\n\r\nHiram was too busy again to send very long letters to Scoville,\r\nalthough during the winter he had been faithful in writing to Sister.\r\n\r\nOat harvest came and the Sunnyside Farm crop was all that Hiram had any\r\nright to hope for. They stacked the oats ready for the thrashing and\r\nthen put both big plow-teams to work, turning under the stubble, raking\r\nand rolling the land. Jerry and two mates (the first trio-hitch Hiram\r\nhad driven on Sunnyside), followed behind the land rollers with the\r\ndrill, sowing cowpeas.\r\n\r\nHaying and wheat harvest was right ahead of them when Miss Pringle\r\ndrove past Sunnyside behind her dappled pony one day, bound for\r\nPringleton.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going to be when I come back, Hiram?\" she called to the\r\nyoung farmer.\r\n\r\n\"Right here, or hereabout,\" he replied. \"What do you want, Delia?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to have something to show you,\" she said, and drove on.\r\n\r\nIt was two hours later that Hiram chanced to walk down the county road\r\ntoward Battick's, intending to take a careful look at the green wheat\r\nat that end of this roadside field--the wheat in which he, as well as\r\nBattick and Mr. Bronson, placed such hopes.\r\n\r\nAlthough he did not apprehend that the same danger menaced the new\r\nwheat which Yancey Battick did, Hiram seldom allowed two days to go by\r\nwithout a scrutiny of the field.\r\n\r\nBy this time the new wheat proved itself, to the most casual eye, to be\r\na different variety from that growing in the remainder of the field. It\r\nwas a foot taller, the bearded heads were beginning to fill out, and,\r\nas Battick had promised, the plants had spread so in growing that the\r\ngrain stood quite as thick as in any other part of the twenty acres.\r\n\r\nHiram saw a figure moving at the edge of the field at the far corner\r\nnext to Yancey Battick's land, and he knew it to be Battick himself.\r\nThese warm days the man was getting around quite briskly and was\r\nfeeling much like his old self.\r\n\r\nBefore Hiram could cross the ditch and start around the lower end of\r\nthe wheat field, as he intended, he saw the dappled pony coming up the\r\nhill. There was somebody beside Miss Pringle on the seat of the buggy.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Hiram! Wait!\" called the spinster. \"I want you to see who I have\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nHiram had already given a second glance. He saw a slim, prettily\r\ndressed figure with a flower-like face under a shade hat. For a half\r\nminute or so the boy had no idea who this person could be. He only\r\nrealized that she was a very pretty girl.\r\n\r\nAnd then Miss Pringle's companion smiled. Hiram fairly jumped.\r\n\r\n\"Sister!\" he shouted, and strode down the hill to meet the dappled pony.\r\n\r\nAt that moment he heard a wild yell from Yancey Battick. The man came\r\nrunning along the lower edge of the field. He bore high above his head\r\na handful of the grain which he had torn up by the roots. His lean\r\nface was actually pale.\r\n\r\n\"Strong! Look here! They've got us!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Who has got us? What is the matter?\" demanded Hiram, startled into\r\nforgetting Sister and her wonderful appearance for the moment. \"What's\r\nturned that wheat in your hand yellow so early?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you see it? Do you see it?\" shouted the excited Battick. \"It's\r\nbeing eaten alive! Little green bugs--not the Hessian fly. It is a pest\r\nI never saw before. It wasn't there the other day. I tell you, they've\r\ngot us!\" concluded the man in a hopeless tone of voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                        THE FIGHT FOR THE WHEAT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter now, Hiram Strong?\" demanded Miss Pringle, urging\r\nher pony nearer. \"For the land's sake! is that Battick man completely\r\ncrazy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hiram! what has happened?\" called Sister.\r\n\r\nShe jumped over the wheel and ran to greet the young farmer. A year\r\nprevious Hiram would certainly have met Sister with a hug and a kiss!\r\nBut this tall, pretty, almost grown-up girl was an entirely different\r\nperson from the child he had known and first remembered as the\r\nboarding-house slavey in Crawberry. She was almost a stranger to him.\r\n\r\n\"Sister! What a surprise! How nice you look!\" he cried, seizing both\r\nher hands and gazing into her glowing eyes with fully as much delight\r\nas she herself displayed. \"What a surprise!\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hiram, I'm so glad you're glad to see me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am! And Mother Atterson?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is fine. And so is Mr. Camp. And Henry Pollock. And everybody!\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you ever come out here without letting me know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Pringle did it all. I am going to stay with her. You'll have to\r\nthank her if you are glad to see me, Hiram.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say I am! Delia, you are a darling!\" cried Hiram, laughing up\r\ninto the good but homely face of the spinster.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the almost breathless Battick reached the roadside.\r\n\r\n\"Here! What's the matter with you, Strong?\" he demanded, shaking the\r\nhandful of wheatstraw at the young farm manager. \"Do you hear what I\r\nsay--or have you gone crazy over those women? That wheat is being eaten\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Sister looking wonderingly at the excited Yancey\r\nBattick.\r\n\r\nMiss Pringle scrambled down from the carriage. They gathered about the\r\nyoung farmer while he examined the affected heads of wheat.\r\n\r\nThese heads were now about half developed. The straw was already three\r\nfeet and a half tall, and the bearded, three-sided heads had been most\r\npromising only a day or two before.\r\n\r\nNow the tiny green bugs (and occasionally a long fly into which the\r\ninsect develops) were evidently sucking the life of the plant. The\r\npresence of both the louse-like insect and the adult fly on the same\r\nstaff of wheat proved to Hiram's mind at once that the creatures were\r\nof a single species and that their growth and development was very\r\nrapid--like that of hard-shell from soft-shell potato beetles.\r\n\r\n\"What do you call those things?\" demanded Miss Pringle looking askance\r\nat the green insects.\r\n\r\n\"It is the English grain louse,\" Hiram announced with conviction.\r\n\"I have been reading about the pest this winter. The louse did\r\nconsiderable damage in grain last year in New Jersey and other parts of\r\nthe East. But how did it get into our wheat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah-h!\" groaned Yancey Battick. \"You can easily answer that. It was put\r\nhere by those that mean to ruin our crop. And between two days, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think that possible?\" Hiram said. \"And yet, what I have\r\nread about this pest suggests that it does not come suddenly into a new\r\nfield of wheat in this way, unless it has already been a scourge in\r\nsome near-by patch of grain the winter before. In such an open winter\r\nas we have had it might have hybernated on the plants. Then, in April,\r\nit begins really to reproduce. But we have watched this wheat so\r\nclosely--\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you the lice have been brought here,\" Battick cried almost\r\nwildly. \"It did not just _happen_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd surely think so,\" Delia Pringle said. \"I never saw those things\r\nbefore. But I heard the other day that some pest had attacked wheat\r\nfields over back of the hill--to the north of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which farms?\" Hiram asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me they said Wilson Banks' wheat was the worst affected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Adam's father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah-h!\" ejaculated Yancey Battick. \"What did I tell you?\"\r\n\r\nOf course, this gossip proved nothing, and Hiram very well knew it. But\r\nboth Battick and Miss Pringle seemed so sure!\r\n\r\n\"Let's go and look at the affected patch,\" Hiram said slowly, and, of\r\ncourse, Sister trailed along with him to the far corner of the field.\r\nShe clung to his arm and chattered away at a great rate, giving Hiram\r\nall the news of Scoville and the Atterson farm neighborhood. Naturally\r\nthis forced Miss Pringle and Battick into each other's company for the\r\nwalk. They did not make a very friendly looking pair, however, for\r\nBattick's gaze was fixed on the ground while Miss Pringle had her head\r\nin the air and did not vouchsafe him a glance!\r\n\r\nThe party came to the corner of the field where Battick had found the\r\nspecimens of the grain louse. A patch several yards square was turning\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\n\"These lice,\" Hiram observed thoughtfully, \"feed on the leaves of the\r\nwheat plant until the grain commences to head. Then they assemble\r\non the heads among the ripening kernels. When the grain ripens they\r\nmigrate to various grasses, the book says, and manage to live until\r\nfall when the new wheat is sown and appears. But we had nothing like\r\nthem here on Sunnyside last year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor did I see any on my patch,\" muttered Battick. \"I tell you they\r\nwere sown here recently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the sharp-eyed girl from Scoville. \"What is this?\"\r\n\r\nShe sprang forward and picked out of the tall and robust wheat several\r\nwithered wheat-straws that were about half developed. She gave them to\r\nHiram.\r\n\r\n\"Did you pull up any plants besides those you brought to me, Mr.\r\nBattick?\" asked the young farm manager, curiously examining the wilted\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\"No. And, say, those are not my wheat! Don't you see, Strong? The\r\nstraw is entirely different, nor is it as well developed as the straw\r\nstanding on this piece.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I saw,\" Sister said softly. \"It is not the same plant as\r\nthis handsome wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got sharp eyes, Sister Cheltenham,\" declared Miss Pringle.\r\n\"Hasn't she, Hiram?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind all that!\" snapped Battick, interrupting crossly. \"What do\r\nyou think about this, Strong? Somebody brought those straws with the\r\nliving insects on them and tossed them in among this wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would seem so,\" Hiram admitted.\r\n\r\n\"The villains! It is no more than what I have expected all along. And\r\nyou and Bronson would not believe me. Now what do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think somebody has it in for us,\" Hiram frankly said. \"This was\r\ndeliberately a malicious act.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it was any of those Bankses they ought to be horsewhipped!\"\r\ndeclared Miss Pringle.\r\n\r\n\"Has Adam been home of late?\" asked Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied the spinster. \"But I bet he has.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to watch this field night and day now till the grain is\r\nripe,\" Battick declared moodily.\r\n\r\n\"But first of all we must get rid of this pest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you do that?\" asked Sister.\r\n\r\n\"Never was anything so bad that it could not be worse,\" declared the\r\nyoung manager of Sunnyside Farm sententiously. \"These flies have only\r\njust begun their nefarious work. There must be some way of stopping\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"How will you do that, Hiram?\" Miss Pringle demanded. \"When the striped\r\nbugs get on my melon vines they're gone, and that's all there is to it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Every blade and ear on which the louse has fastened itself must be\r\ndestroyed. We must be ruthless in rooting the plague out.\"\r\n\r\nBattick groaned aloud. He hated to think of losing a single grain of\r\nthe new wheat. \"How are you going to do it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It must be pulled up and burned. And this may not be the only spot\r\nwhere the pest was thrown.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll look all around the field,\" Battick said eagerly. \"You don't see\r\nany place where the scoundrel has walked into the wheat to spread the\r\npest, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. He probably did nothing to trample down the wheat and so reveal to\r\nus where he had worked.\r\n\r\n\"I would make sure how wide the area of affection is before pulling up\r\nany wheat, Mr. Battick,\" said Hiram. \"I'll bring the boys down here and\r\nwe'll burn a wide enough area to surely put the louse out of business\r\nin this field. No use cutting off the dog's tail half an inch at a\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nBattick understood this homely saying, and only groaned again.\r\n\r\nHiram and the girls returned to the road, and Miss Pringle and Sister\r\nclimbed into the buggy. Hiram walked beside the vehicle to the Pringle\r\ncottage, and remained there for supper.\r\n\r\nThe change in Sister in the time since Hiram had last seen her seemed\r\nmarvelous. Not having seen a picture of her in all that time, the\r\nsurprise Hiram felt was even greater that it otherwise would have been.\r\nSister positively had become a pretty girl.\r\n\r\nBattick came up to report after supper. He had found but that one place\r\nwhere the grain louse was at work. Hiram took Orrin and Jim Larry and\r\none of the new men and went down with Battick to burn the affected\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nHe slashed into that corner with a scythe and cut out almost a quarter\r\nof an acre of the wheat. Meanwhile the other boys had been smearing\r\noily sacks over the condemned patch, and when the fire was put to it\r\neven in its green state, the grain blazed up hotly. They forked what\r\nHiram had cut down on to the fire and made sure of burning every spear\r\nof wheat that could possibly be affected.\r\n\r\nIt was furthermore arranged that a night watch should be kept upon\r\nthis end of the twenty acre wheat field. Hiram, as well as Yancey\r\nBattick, was confident that the pest had not come here by chance. An\r\nenemy that would try such a despicable trick once, might try to repeat\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you I have felt all along that we shall have to fight to get a\r\ndecent harvest of this wheat,\" said Battick.\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll fight!\" returned Hiram grimly. \"Go ahead, Mr. Battick, and\r\nget your gun and watch here until midnight. Then either Orrin or I will\r\ncome down and relieve you. I don't mean to let our enemies beat us, no\r\nmatter who they may be.\"\r\n\r\nThe young farm manager had an interest in the success of this new wheat\r\nmatched only by Yancey Battick's own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                              DAY DREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an uncertainty in the atmosphere of Sunnyside Farm and an\r\nexpectancy of trouble in all their minds. What would happen next? Would\r\nthe enemy strike again, having been thwarted in one attempt to destroy\r\nthe new wheat?\r\n\r\nThe fact that the soil had been well enriched and that the forcing\r\neffect of nitrate made the crop grow so fast was really the salvation\r\nof Yancey Battick's new grain. The pest could not work fast enough to\r\novercome the rapidity of the wheat's growth.\r\n\r\nHiram had a multitude of things just now to take up his time; yet he\r\nmade a pilgrimage to each farm in the vicinity to discover which wheat\r\nfields, if any besides that on Sunnyside, were affected by the new\r\npest. The English grain louse had not been seen in this part of the\r\ncountry he was sure, previous to a few months before.\r\n\r\n\"It bred on Banks's land,\" Mr. Turner told Hiram Strong. \"When I first\r\nsaw the critter during the winter--Banks called me over to show it to\r\nme--I told him I'd plow up that wheat as soon as I could, if I was him,\r\nand plant something else--spring wheat, or oats, or something. It was a\r\npuling kind of crop anyway. And it's a sight now!\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume his land is poor?\"\r\n\r\n\"You presume just right. And he's shiftless. Don't raise more than half\r\na crop of anything. Don't keep cattle--they are too much trouble, he\r\nsays--and his farm is getting poorer and poorer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen his kind of farmer before.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet you have! I've often thought, Mr. Strong, that a shiftless\r\nneighbor is worse than a dishonest one. You are on the watch for a\r\nthief; but a shiftless or lazy man will make more trouble than forty\r\nthieves, I do believe.\"\r\n\r\nHiram considered that Mr. Turner was about right. He went far enough\r\nwith the old man to look at the Banks' wheat. It was completely\r\nblighted by the pest and to Hiram's mind would scarcely be worth\r\nthrashing. Besides, when the binder went through the field he knew very\r\nwell that the pest would lodge on the weeds and grass that bordered\r\nthe grain, and would thus exist--a serious menace--until the new wheat\r\nappeared in the fall.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what I would do if I had money, Mr. Turner, and owned a\r\nfarm next to this one?\" the young farmer said.\r\n\r\n\"What would you do?\" asked the old man suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"I'd offer Banks a price for his standing grain and then burn it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey! You surely would have money to burn,\" grumbled Turner.\r\n\r\n\"Get the other neighbors to go into the deal with you. It will save\r\nyour crops in the end. First you know, you'll have to give up raising\r\ngrain to starve out the pest. And maybe that won't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"'A fool and his money are soon parted,'\" said Turner.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" Hiram rejoined slyly. \"But how about a fool and his wheat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh!\" was Turner's only comment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hiram learned that Adam Banks had been at home over Sunday\r\nand on that occasion could easily have brought the specimens of the\r\ngrain pest to the fields on Sunnyside. He would never have a chance to\r\nrepeat the trick, however--if he was guilty--for there was a guard at\r\nthe wheat field every night, and by day some of the workmen were always\r\nin sight of the piece of seed-wheat.\r\n\r\nHiram Strong enjoyed Sister's visit immensely. The girl seemed just\r\nlike a bit of home--the only real home Hiram had known since he was a\r\nchild. Had she been really his sister he could have thought no more of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd she was still a healthy, wholesome girl. She was not growing up too\r\nfast, as he sometimes thought Lettie Bronson was.\r\n\r\nSister, in a gingham frock and one of Miss Pringle's sunbonnets,\r\nwas out with Hiram all over the big farm. She knew enough about\r\nagricultural pursuits now, and loved nature enough, to enjoy thoroughly\r\nSunnyside and all it meant to Hiram. The latter, too, found in Sister a\r\nconfidante such as he had never had before.\r\n\r\nShe could help, too. The clover crop ripened suddenly because of a\r\ndry spell. The brilliant crimson blossoms which gave to the fields a\r\nblush such as no other flower gives, began to turn brown at their base\r\npetals. The mower had to be brought into use at once--in fact, two of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSister rode the tedder and managed to stir the clover well behind\r\nboth mowing machines. In spite of the dry spell it was a heavy crop\r\nof clover hay, and the odor of it ascended in the noonday heat as the\r\nincense must have ascended from the altars to the Sun God in ancient\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe two teams of Percherons were at work six days a week. As soon as\r\nthe clover was made and drawn to the mows, the big plows were put\r\nin to turn over the clover sod. This was raked lightly, rolled, and\r\nthen the corn was drilled. The early corn was already up and under the\r\nsecond or third cultivation. Everything at Sunnyside was on the rush.\r\n\r\nThe cattle were on regular pasture. Twelve of the sleekest and\r\noldest were held in the pens for fattening. They would be the first\r\n\"commercial crop\" since Hiram had come to Sunnyside sold off the farm,\r\nsave a part of the previous year's wheat.\r\n\r\nFollowing the plowing of the clover sod, the areas where oats had been\r\nand the cowpeas put in for a soilage crop were turned under, and corn\r\nwas planted on that land. Hiram was planning for a real corn crop this\r\nyear, and for the most part he used the seed corn he had raised from\r\nthat of Daniel Brown. Another corn crib was built at this time to be\r\nready for the expected harvest.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the corn was planted where the peas were turned under for\r\nmanure, the regular haying came on. Such hay as there was on Sunnyside\r\nhad to be harvested in a hurry. It was a thin crop, for it had been\r\nseeded to timothy and red top several years before. Hiram decided to\r\nplow most of this meadow land for wheat in the fall and seed some of\r\nthe present wheat- and corn-land for meadow. He turned the cattle into\r\nthe mowing fields, therefore, as soon as the hay was out of the way.\r\n\r\nNo further menace had attacked the wheat. The fields of grain on\r\nSunnyside were a beautiful sight--now turning a golden yellow and with\r\nthe heavy heads nodding to the harvest. Battick's new variety was at\r\nleast a foot taller than that in any other field on the farm.\r\n\r\nThe man had watched the special wheat as a mother cares for her\r\nnew-born babe. Night and day he hung about the edges of the field. He\r\neven crept over the patch that had been burned seeking for any of the\r\ninsects that might not have been destroyed by the fire.\r\n\r\n\"I think that man must be more than half crazy, as Jim says he is,\"\r\nSister said to Hiram in commenting upon Battick.\r\n\r\n\"Why does Jim--and you--think Battick is insane?\" Hiram asked her,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\"Why, he makes such a fuss over that new wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"His whole heart is set upon developing this Staff of Life Wheat,\" the\r\nyoung farm manager said thoughtfully. \"And so is mine, Sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Hi?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I am crazy, too,\" the young fellow said. \"I believe my\r\nfortune, as well as Battick's, is wrapped up in that wheat. Somehow,\r\nfrom the very first time I saw the seed in his house, the night I\r\narrived in this neighborhood, I have felt that the new wheat meant much\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\nSister looked at him, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"I really wish you would say right out what you mean, Hi Strong!\" she\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I am day dreaming, I suppose,\" he told her. \"But when I look over this\r\nbillowing field I can see thousands of acres of the same grain, all in\r\none mowing, and a crop that will fill vast granaries with wheat. There\r\nwould be a fortune in a single crop of such size.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hiram, you are thinking of the wheat fields of the great\r\nNorthwest,\" Sister said in a low tone. \"Are you dreaming of going so\r\nfar away from us all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sister,\" said the young farmer seriously, \"I set out to farm Mrs.\r\nAtterson's Eighty with the idea of making that a stepping-stone for\r\nsomething bigger. I have got the bigger thing; but it is not big\r\nenough. I am still working for another man. I want to work for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but it takes so much capital to run one of those great wheat\r\nranches.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I couldn't expect to begin at the top. If I begin for myself\r\nit must be at the bottom. But I have more than a thousand dollars\r\nsaved, and I have a quarter interest in Battick's new wheat. Before\r\nthis time next year, Sister, I ought to have at least five thousand in\r\ncash!\r\n\r\n\"When I have that much money I am going to strike out for myself--on\r\nmy own hook. Whether it will be in the Northwest or not I don't know.\r\nBut Hiram Strong, Sister, is going to be his own man before he gets\r\nthrough, not another fellow's hired hand!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n                         CORN AND COMPARISONS\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram and Sister (who had as yet not discovered her first name) often\r\ndiscussed her personal mystery. The lawyer who had finally searched her\r\nout at the Atterson farm, having traced her through the records of the\r\norphanage in which she had spent so many unhappy years, had neglected\r\nto tell her the name with which she had been christened.\r\n\r\n\"Nor do I know my little brother's name. Poor boy! To think of his\r\nhaving been sent to a reform school! I often cry about him, Hiram. How\r\nawful it is for him to be wandering about the world, maybe ill-used,\r\nbeaten, hungry--perhaps growing up _wicked_! He perhaps will not find\r\nanybody like Mother Atterson--or you--or Mr. Lem Camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that you had much to congratulate yourself about until we\r\nall left Crawberry and got out on Mother Atterson's farm,\" said Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it seems to me now that I was pretty lucky,\" the girl said\r\nsoberly. \"But poor little Claude couldn't possibly have found such good\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Claude'!\" repeated Hiram in surprise. \"How do you know his name is\r\nClaude?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't--really. Sometimes I call him 'Marvin.' I like both names,\"\r\nreplied Sister. \"It doesn't really matter what I call him till I know\r\nwhat his really, truly name is, does it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, for goodness' sake! don't call him 'Claude.' If he is a real\r\nboy, that will make him sick! And how do you know he is so much younger\r\nthan you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the lawyer say so?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he didn't. He didn't say how old--er--Marvin was. But, of course,\r\nhe must be only a little boy to run away and get lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! He may be older than you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, how you talk! Of course he isn't, Hi Strong. How could my little\r\nbrother be older than I am? Why, that is ridiculous!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a mighty hazy idea of your brother, I do believe,\" Hiram\r\nchuckled. \"If he was arrested and sent to the reform school--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hiram! How can you? My brother arrested?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you suppose he got into the reform school?\" demanded her\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Do they have to be bad to get to reform schools?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'd have to be sent by the Court to such an institution. He must have\r\nbeen old enough to be arrested for doing something, Sister. It needn't\r\nhave been anything very bad--swiping apples, or throwing stones, or\r\nsomething like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Hiram!\" murmured Sister, almost in tears.\r\n\r\n\"I know it sounds hard. Sometimes a committing magistrate is pretty\r\nharsh. They don't have Children's Courts everywhere. And sometimes\r\nthere isn't any other place to send kids but to the reform school.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear, you make my heart ache,\" declared Sister, sighing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he was some size to have been sent to such an institution\r\ninstead of to an orphanage, as you were.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I suppose so.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long was he in the reform school before he broke out?\" Hiram asked.\r\n\r\n\"That lawyer did not tell us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, when did he run away?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess it was some time ago, come to think of it,\" the girl admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me you and Mother Atterson didn't ask many questions of that\r\nman,\" said Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"We were so stirred up!\" cried Sister. \"And he was only at the house a\r\nfew minutes. He told me to be sure and let him know if I went anywhere\r\nelse. I wrote to him when I was coming out here. But he never replied.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to ask him a few things,\" muttered Hiram thoughtfully. Then:\r\n\"So you have no idea when your brother ran away?\"\r\n\r\n\"It must have been some time before the lawyer found me last year. He\r\nsaid he had been hunting for both of us, and he wanted to make sure of\r\nme, so that I would not run away and make trouble. For the property my\r\nGrandmother Cheltenham left us cannot be divided till both heirs are\r\nfound. That is just the way he put it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! A nice way to fix it, I must say. Your grandmother must have\r\nbeen a pretty cranky old tea-party.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Hiram. Maybe she did what she thought was best. But I do\r\nhope that I take after my mother's side of the family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which can't be any worse than the Cheltenhams in any case, eh?\"\r\nchuckled Hiram. \"Nice name--'Cheltenham.' Sounds as though you ought to\r\nbe related to the King of England, or some of the nobility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, you're laughing at me, Hiram! I'd just as lief my name was\r\nsomething short and nice sounding--like 'Strong,' or 'Post,' or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe Orrin's name isn't so short and sweet.\" Hiram said suddenly.\r\n\"You know, as I wrote you, there is a mystery as to what Orrin's name\r\nreally is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Sister thoughtfully. \"And Orrin is such a nice\r\nyoung man. I asked him the other day, Hi, what he supposed might have\r\nbecome of my little brother after he ran away from the reform school.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he seemed real interested. He said maybe Claude--I mean,\r\nMarvin--was wise to run away. Orrin said sometimes they hire boys out\r\nfrom those schools to farmers who make them work like slaves. He seemed\r\nto know all about such things.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe Orrin must have been in one of those schools himself when he\r\nwas a boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky if he wasn't in a worse place,\" thought Hiram.\r\n\r\nBut he did not go any deeper into a discussion of Orrin's affairs at\r\nthis time. The mystery of who and what Orrin Post really was seemed\r\nquite as far from being solved as the whereabouts of Sister's brother.\r\n\r\nThe wheat was now nodding heavy heads for the harvest. The binders and\r\nextra harvest hands came to Sunnyside Farm after reaping Mr. Bronson's\r\nother wheat fields. Everybody about the place--even Sister--worked in\r\nthe wheat fields, standing up the golden shocks, from early morning\r\nuntil nightfall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Everybody about the place--even Sister--worked in the\r\nwheat fields.]\r\n\r\nClose on the heels of the harvesting the great tractor drawing the\r\nthreshing machine rumbled up to Sunnyside. The regular threshing crew\r\ncame with it so that the work at Sunnyside went much more rapidly this\r\ntime than it had the year before, although the yield of grain was far\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nBut how everyone did toil at it! Threshing under the very best\r\nconditions is the hardest farm work there is. It is not such tedious\r\nwork as the making of the crop--the plowing and raking, rolling and\r\nseeding, and the cultivation of it, or of the mowing and binding; but\r\nfor out and out bone-breaking labor, and in the hottest part of the\r\nyear, threshing takes the palm. It must be hurried, too, for there is\r\nalways another grain ranch to go to. And the season, too, is that when\r\nother work on the farm is urgent.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson came himself to Sunnyside to watch Hiram's wheat and oats\r\nthreshed. Besides, he was particularly interested in the yield of\r\nBattick's new wheat.\r\n\r\nLettie came up with him from Plympton and remained over night at Miss\r\nPringle's, with Sister. She seemed unfeignedly glad to see Sister\r\nagain, and the two girls raced about together all day, watching the\r\ntoiling threshing crew, and riding the empty wagons back to the field.\r\n\r\n\"One seemed,\" Orrin said to Hiram Strong, \"as big a kid as the other.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening, however, after the boys had eaten supper and washed at\r\nthe bunkhouse, they strolled over to Miss Pringle's, and the girls met\r\nthem with their most grown-up manner. Indeed, Lettie flirted with Orrin\r\nin a way that actually amazed Hiram. He was glad that Sister was not\r\naddicted to such manners. And yet, of course, Lettie meant no harm and\r\nOrrin Post seemed to understand. Hiram wondered if he had been used to\r\nthe kind of society in which Lettie had learned to behave in this way.\r\n\r\nOf course, Orrin was quite \"grown-up.\" Lettie looked upon him as\r\nfair game, without doubt. She would not have considered for a moment\r\ntreating Hiram in this way.\r\n\r\nSister did not attempt to copy the more sophisticated Lettie. Yet she\r\nseemed to approve fully of the daughter of the owner of Sunnyside Farm.\r\n\r\n\"Lettie is so much nicer than I used to think her,\" Sister said gently\r\nto Hiram. \"She is so kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"She wants me to go back to Plympton with her and stay a while before I\r\ngo home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" questioned Hiram again.\r\n\r\n\"Would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--don't--know,\" said Hiram slowly.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the sort of young people he had met at the Bronson house\r\nthe night of the party. He had never been able to make up his mind\r\nwhether he had been invited on that occasion out of sheer kindness,\r\nor not. Hiram's perceptions were keen. Would Sister be comfortable in\r\ntheir society? Would they, young and gay and careless and more or less\r\nintimate friends from childhood, make her feel a little as though she\r\nwere outside of all their fun and friendships? Sister was sweet and\r\nlively, true and likable, but could she, after all, adjust herself\r\nto surroundings which were very different from those she had been\r\naccustomed to?\r\n\r\n\"I'd like you to advise me, Hiram,\" said Sister softly.\r\n\r\n\"What does Delia say?\" exclaimed Hiram suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"She says go if I want to, and if I don't like it to come back here\r\nany time. She says I can hire a flivver there to bring me back for a\r\ncouple of dollars--if I am in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" exclaimed Hiram with relief. \"I always did think Delia Pringle\r\nwas a mighty sensible person. I agree with her, Sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" thought Hiram, \"Sister is likable and attractive, and,\r\nmoreover, pretty well able to look out for herself. And then, Lettie\r\nis kind and sweet-natured and thoughtful, and why should I take it for\r\ngranted that her friends are not the same sort?\"\r\n\r\nOrrin only laughed about Lettie when the boys went back to Sunnyside at\r\nten o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be jealous, Strong,\" he said. \"She is only practising on\r\nme. She thinks you are not ripe for such nonsense yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" thought Hiram. \"Do I appear to be such an awful kid?\"\r\n\r\nComparisons are odious, however. Hiram did not propose to judge Lettie\r\nby the same standard by which he judged Sister. They were two very\r\ndifferent girls.\r\n\r\nThe work of threshing went on apace. Hiram had arranged his wagons as\r\nhe had the year before in harvesting the ensilage for the silo--putting\r\nthe small wheels in the rear and the big wheels in front. They thus\r\nbrought enormous loads of the golden sheaves on the racks to the\r\nthreshing machine, merely dumping the load. Men stood on both sides\r\nof the heap and forked the sheaves into the chute. This was a modern\r\nthreshing machine which automatically cut the bands as the sheaves were\r\nfed into the maw of the roaring monster.\r\n\r\nThe straw was blown into a huge pile at one side of the barn, later to\r\nbe baled; for good wheat straw is valuable. The straw from the oats\r\nHiram used for bedding.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson or Hiram stood by the men bagging the grain, keeping\r\ntally. The ordinary wheat averaged thirty-two and a half bushels to\r\nthe acre--almost twice the average of the year before, and better by\r\nseveral bushels than the average on the neighboring farms. Still, this\r\nwas no great yield.\r\n\r\nThe threshing machine was then run in between the oat stacks and the\r\nbundles of oats were pitched by crews of four men into the chute. The\r\noats yielded a fair average--nothing great. But, then, they had been\r\nraised more as a preparatory crop than anything else. All the oat land\r\nhad grown a heavy crop of cowpeas for soiling, and now the corn stood\r\nrank, black, and knee high upon all those oat fields.\r\n\r\nThe oats were run through the threshing machine before the new wheat\r\nwas brought up from the lower end of the twenty-acre piece which lay\r\nalong the road. The oats had swept every kernel of the ordinary wheat\r\nout of the machine. The Staff of Life Wheat, as Hiram had dubbed it,\r\nwas the handsomest grain anybody working on the threshing crew had ever\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nAnd how it did yield! It was a marvel considering how thinly the seed\r\nhad been sowed. Still, Battick was not satisfied, and almost wept\r\nwhenever he thought of the quarter acre that had been burned. From the\r\nremaining three-and-three-quarters acres was threshed a hundred and\r\nsixty-eight bushels and a peck of grain--the biggest yield that had\r\never been known in the neighborhood of Sunnyside within the memory of\r\nthe oldest living farmers.\r\n\r\nHiram, flushed and excited, felt like shouting in his happiness,\r\nself-contained though he usually was.\r\n\r\n\"Even when this land was all virgin prairie, I do not believe they got\r\ngreater yields of wheat,\" Mr. Bronson declared.\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" Hiram said thoughtfully, \"a forty-five bushel average is an\r\nordinary harvest in Kansas and Nebraska. And further north the yield is\r\neven greater. This, Mr. Bronson, is not wheat land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is good enough for me,\" declared his employer, warmly. \"Those\r\nfellows out there in the Northwest are under greater expense than I am\r\nfor tractors, machinery, and wages. I am pretty well satisfied. If you\r\ndo as well for me with the corn--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, when it comes to corn, this is just the land for it!\" cried Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"And with tractors instead of horses--\"\r\n\r\nHiram shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I've been figuring that out, Mr. Bronson,\" the young farmer said.\r\n\"Nothing less than three hundred acres of corn--and as much of it in\r\none piece as possible--would pay under tractor cultivation. Sunnyside\r\ncould never be a tractor farm. The fields are too much cut up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n                         EXPLOITING THE WHEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wheat threshing was past. The plows were going again, and following\r\nthe raking and smoothing of the fields Hiram Strong put in either\r\nensilage corn and peas, or a mixture of grass seeds for new mowing.\r\n\r\nThere were more than a hundred head of young stock on Sunnyside\r\nby midsummer, for Mr. Bronson was continually adding to the herd.\r\nSunnyside was bound to wax fat in another year with all this kine to\r\nenrich the acres. Whoever Mr. Bronson sold the farm to would get, after\r\nall, one of the most productive farms in the Pringleton district.\r\n\r\nOrrin Post (Hiram always thought of him by that name, whether it was\r\nrightfully his or not) was fairly in love with the place. He often said\r\nto Hiram:\r\n\r\n\"Strong, it would be the height of my ambition to own this place. I\r\ncould settle down here in happiness for life.\"\r\n\r\n\"And marry Miss Pringle?\" suggested Hiram chuckling.\r\n\r\n\"Delia has her cap set for another fellow,\" returned Orrin, grinning\r\nwidely. \"Believe me, she will get him, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" snapped Hiram, thinking the tables were\r\nbeing turned upon him and not liking it after all.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing personal. You are not the fellow, Strong,\" said Orrin.\r\n\r\n\"It must be Jim Larry, then, that she is after,\" sniffed the farm\r\nmanager. \"But if you like it, Orrin, I should say Sunnyside would make\r\na mighty nice homestead. But, I tell you truly, Mr. Bronson isn't\r\nwriting anything much on the credit side of the ledger yet. It takes\r\ntime to bring back an abused farm like this to a paying basis. This new\r\nwheat of Battick's will put Mr. Bronson ahead of the game. Yet that\r\nought not to be charged to the profits of the farm, for it was entirely\r\na side issue.\"\r\n\r\nThe prospect for a bountiful corn harvest was, however, plain. When the\r\ncorn was in the cribs they might easily count a clean slate, at least,\r\nwithout referring to the Staff of Life Wheat.\r\n\r\nHiram was elated when he went through the fields of early corn and\r\nexamined the ears now rapidly filling out. He was confident that nobody\r\never grew a better corn crop on Sunnyside Farm than he was making.\r\n\r\nSister made her visit to Lettie Bronson and came back to Miss\r\nPringle's fairly radiant. She had learned to put up her hair in a more\r\nattractive fashion and had bought a new summer dress under Lettie's\r\ntutelage which she said made her other clothes look \"countrified\" in\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\n\"Lettie Bronson is so hospitable and nice, Hiram,\" Sister said. \"I\r\nlet her introduce me as 'Cecilia Cheltenham.' It sounds stylish, and\r\nI could see it impressed Lettie's friends. Do you think it is wrong,\r\nHiram? Maybe 'Cecilia' is my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as good as any other, I guess, Sister,\" Hiram said kindly. \"But\r\ndon't for pity's sake name your brother some name that he won't like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! 'Marvin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"He can stand that better than 'Claude' or 'Percy.' Do give the kid a\r\nchance.\"\r\n\r\nHiram had come to consider the lost boy as a little fellow, too,\r\nalthough Sister had no particular warrant for that belief.\r\n\r\nSister's visit came to a close. She knew Mother Atterson and Lem Camp\r\nmissed her sorely. She had now been at Miss Pringle's all of two months.\r\n\r\nEverybody about the place thought a deal of Sister. Delia Pringle\r\ndeclared she was the nicest girl she had ever known. Orrin could not\r\ndo too much for her and treated her with a brotherly affection that\r\nHiram thought might breed some confidences on his part. But Orrin\r\nnever touched upon his personal affairs save on one occasion, and then\r\nlightly enough.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you have any brothers and sisters in all your life, Orrin?\"\r\nSister asked, pointblank, in Hiram's hearing.\r\n\r\n\"I had a sister,\" Orrin replied shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Didn't you love her, Orrin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much indeed.\" He spoke in a low voice and turned away his head so\r\nthat she might not read the expression in his face. \"I never talk about\r\nher,\" he added in a tone that precluded further questioning on the\r\ngirl's part.\r\n\r\nThis single reference to his past life was practically all Hiram had\r\never heard Orrin make. Sometimes curiosity burned so hotly in Hiram's\r\nthoughts that he was tempted to demand of Orrin who he was and what his\r\nreal name was. Was he the \"Theodore Chester\" the bewhiskered farmer\r\nfrom the other side of Pringleton and the lawyer, Eben Craddock, were\r\nsearching for back there in the winter?\r\n\r\nThere was one thing Hiram did not want to do, however; he did not wish\r\nto say or do anything to offend Orrin, so that the latter would leave\r\nhim. More and more had the young farm manager come to depend on this\r\nhelper who had been with him so long. He was paying Orrin bigger\r\nwages than anybody else on the place. But, as he told Mr. Bronson, if\r\nanything happened, he could depend upon Orrin to go ahead with the\r\nwork and carry out the plans already formulated for the improvement of\r\nSunnyside.\r\n\r\nNothing did happen--of any unlucky nature, at least--not even to Yancey\r\nBattick's wheat. Battick had watched the grain from the threshing with\r\nquite as keen apprehension as before.\r\n\r\nHowever, if Adam Banks--or any other ill-disposed person--wished to\r\nruin the yield of seed wheat, he did not succeed in such plans. The\r\nnew wheat was spread upon the floor of the attic of the new house at\r\nSunnyside, and that dwelling had been built mouse and rat proof!\r\n\r\nSamples sent to various experimental farmers and agricultural stations\r\nwith the well-written claims for the new wheat prepared by Yancey\r\nBattick attracted wide attention. Photographs of the growing wheat\r\nwhich Mr. Bronson had had taken were reproduced and printed in some of\r\nthe farm papers. Every wheat grower who saw the grain and heard of its\r\ndevelopment was enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nBut the partners in the Staff of Life Wheat determined to sell none\r\nof the surplus of this present crop in large lots. Battick got up a\r\ncatchy advertisement headed: \"Grow it in Your Garden,\" showing how any\r\nfarmer might develop seed enough from one fifty-cent packet to plant\r\nan acre of the new wheat in a year's time and so, in two years, gain a\r\nforty-acre crop.\r\n\r\nThe advertisement brought almost immediate returns, and the orders grew\r\nin number daily. At this packet rate the partners were getting for the\r\nseed wheat a hundred and twenty-eight dollars per bushel!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! there is no money in the seed business is there?\" said Mr.\r\nBronson, widely smiling.\r\n\r\nAnd they were giving something of value for the fifty-cent orders that\r\ncame in with a rush. With care any gardener could raise seed enough for\r\nan acre of grain, just as their advertisement said. The Staff of Life\r\nWheat was a really wonderful variety.\r\n\r\nOf course, the advertising cost a good deal and the exploitation of the\r\nwheat in this way entailed much work. But the profit was enticing.\r\n\r\nThe Rural Free Delivery mail carrier began to object to handling\r\nthe traffic of Sunnyside Farm, and Battick was obliged to drive to\r\nPringleton three times a week to mail packets of seed and get the\r\nmoney orders cashed. Mr. Bronson banked the money in a special account\r\nat the Plympton National Bank, and the seed selling business grew in\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nMiss Pringle had learned to use a typewriter, and Battick had to hire\r\nher to help with the correspondence. This pleased Hiram immensely, for\r\nit put Yancey Battick in a position where he had to associate with the\r\ngood-hearted spinster. The man did not have much show to continue a\r\nwoman hater when he was associated daily with Delia Pringle!\r\n\r\n\"I told you,\" chuckled Orrin, \"that Delia had set her cap for a\r\nparticular person in this vicinity. And it is not you or me or Jimmy\r\nLarry. Yancey Battick is in much more danger right now from Delia, than\r\nhis wheat ever was from the plottings of Adam Banks, believe me!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                               KING CORN\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram Strong had grown taller corn with bigger ears on it in the East\r\nthan any of the now ripening crop on Sunnyside Farm. But in bulk of\r\nshelled corn he knew he had never equaled this present crop.\r\n\r\nOne small field he had prepared especially for his seed corn. By this\r\ntime he had come strongly to believe in the yellow-red strain of corn\r\nhe had originally obtained from Daniel Brown, and this special field\r\nhad been planted to that variety exclusively.\r\n\r\nHiram had from the very start prepared this field in a particular way.\r\nIt had been a fallow piece on which had been thrown with the manure\r\nspreader during the winter about ten tons of fertilizer to the acre.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could get on the field with his heavy horses he disked\r\nthe piece both ways. This enabled him to plow at least eight inches\r\ndeep, and he put three of the Percherons on the plow.\r\n\r\nHiram disked the field again after plowing, and harrowed it twice,\r\nmaking the soil as loose in the end as a garden plot. With this\r\npreparation, the bottom of the seed bed was as loose as the top and the\r\nplant roots when they got to growing, found plenty of room to develop.\r\n\r\nHiram did not put this corn in until the first of May. He planted it\r\none grain to the hill, sixteen inches apart in the row, and the seed\r\nhad been so carefully selected that he had an almost perfect stand all\r\nover the field. Hiram was no friend to replanting in any case.\r\n\r\nAt the time he put the corn in he sowed in the row fifty pounds\r\nof commercial fertilizer to the acre. When the corn was up a few\r\ninches and the root system began to develop, the young manager of\r\nSunnyside Farm sowed a hundred pounds to the acre of a special forcing\r\nfertilizer--straddling the row with the cornplanter and sowing this\r\nspecial fertilizer in rows down the middle.\r\n\r\nOne day, about the time the bulk of Hiram's crop was hardening, Mr.\r\nBrown drove along and Hiram hailed him and asked him to walk with him\r\nthrough this field of seed corn. The grizzled old fellow noted the\r\nstrong stalks, the wide blades, and the heavy ears with brightening\r\nvisage. He loved corn! On Hiram's invitation to do so, he tore the\r\nhusk away from several ears.\r\n\r\n\"By gum!\" exclaimed the old man, \"I thought I raised good corn. I\r\nalways have raised good corn--the best in this county, if I say it who\r\nshouldn't. But you've got me beat, Mr. Strong--you've got me beat.\r\n\r\n\"This variety here, wherever you got it, is better than my best, and\r\nhow even it runs! I never saw the like before. Where'd you get it? I\r\nthought you were raising corn from seed you bought of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" Hiram told him with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Where'd you get it? I'd like to compare this new variety with my kind\r\nof corn,\" went on the farmer, not heeding Hiram's assurance.\r\n\r\n\"This is your corn you've got hold of, Mr. Brown,\" Hiram said.\r\n\r\n\"You don't tell me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly do. I consider it the best corn for this soil that I\r\ncould find. It is only better than yours because I take more pains in\r\nselecting and testing the seed than you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"By gum! I can't believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every hill of this corn, and the main part of my crop, came from the\r\ntwo baskets of corn I bought of you a year ago last March. Half of that\r\nI discarded. Probably two-thirds of this whole field I shall feed to\r\nthe cattle. Out of the rest I will sell you what you may need for six\r\ndollars a basket, Mr. Brown.\"\r\n\r\n\"By gum! I want it,\" exclaimed the old fellow. \"Some of it, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"It takes but about fourteen ears of corn, you know, to plant an acre.\r\nI'll sell you the same quantity I bought of you, if you like, at the\r\nprice stated. I think it is worth that to raise seed like this, don't\r\nyou, Mr. Brown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Boy, if what you tell me is true--if this is my corn--then I don't\r\nknow much about corn growing, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you know about all there is to know about corn growing to\r\ndate,\" laughed Hiram. \"But you certainly do not know how to select and\r\ntest your seed. And then, as I told you back there when I bought of\r\nyou, you were too good to the rats and the mice. Many a kernel of corn\r\nis planted the germ of which the sharp little teeth of the rodents have\r\nemasculated.\"\r\n\r\nDaniel Brown was not the only enthusiastic spectator of Hiram's corn.\r\nAnd the harvest bore out the promise, in spite of a heavy wind-storm\r\nthat knocked down some of it. This that was blown down had glazed and\r\nwas well matured. Hiram harvested it at once and sold it to fatten hogs\r\nat the market price.\r\n\r\nThis was a small loss compared to the value of the entire crop. This\r\nyear Sunnyside followed the methods of big corn growers, and most\r\nof the corn was husked on the standing stalk, the eager cattle being\r\nturned in to graze on the fodder.\r\n\r\nFifty head of cattle marched off the farm that fall, stuffed with the\r\ncheapest kind of foods, and brought just as good a price as they would\r\nhad they been winter-fattened with corn.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that only the new wheat should be raised on Sunnyside\r\nthe coming year. The partnership in the Staff of Life Wheat still\r\ncontinued, and they expected to sell the crop for seed as high as ten\r\ndollars a bushel to the big wheat growers. Hiram's share of the profits\r\nof the first crop had been a little over four thousand dollars. He felt\r\nthat he was actually a wealthy man!\r\n\r\nBut he was thinking larger, and his mental view was much wider than\r\nwhen he had arrived at Sunnyside Farm. He wrote Sister that no small\r\ncontract would ever satisfy him again. He heard of and saw farmers all\r\nthrough this corn belt making thirty and forty thousand dollars on a\r\nsingle crop.\r\n\r\nAt the County Fair he met and talked with a young man no older than\r\nOrrin Post who had cleared that season more than ten thousand dollars\r\nfrom raising corn on shares!\r\n\r\n    \"If a man can get hold of a thousand acres, work it with tractors\r\n    and have ordinary good luck, in one season he can pay for his\r\n    land,\" Hiram wrote to his friends in the East. \"It sounds big. It\r\n    almost staggers one to think of it. It is a gamble!\r\n\r\n    \"But I feel that I have in me the pluck to take that gambler's\r\n    chance. I am going to bide my time, but have my money ready. The\r\n    money is in the great wheat fields of the Northwest. America must\r\n    feed the world, and I want to do my part. Ten years of raising\r\n    wheat in a big way will enable me to retire, if I wish to.\r\n\r\n    \"My father worked for other men all his life. I am going to be my\r\n    own man before I get through. To this I set my hand and seal,\r\n\r\n                                                        \"Hiram Strong.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a wee note of anxiety, if not sorrow, in the return letter\r\nwhich Sister wrote. Those on the Atterson Eighty feared that Hiram\r\nStrong was getting altogether too far away from them.\r\n\r\nBut there was something else in Sister's letter that struck Hiram much\r\nmore sharply. It suggested a possibility that startled him, to say\r\nthe least, and roused in his mind again much suspicion regarding the\r\nbewhiskered farmer, whose name, he believed, was \"Orrin Post,\" and his\r\nown Orrin's connection with this man.\r\n\r\nSister wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"What do you think, Hiram? My lawyer wrote me from Boston that\r\n    perhaps I might have been near to my dear little lost brother\r\n    when I was out there to see you and Miss Pringle. He writes\r\n    that he traced poor little Marvin (or whatever his name may be)\r\n    to the Middle West, and that a correspondent of his, whom he put\r\n    on the case, writes that he believes the boy has been in your\r\n    neighborhood. The western lawyer is named Eben Craddock.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n                       WHO IS THEODORE CHESTER?\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time the great corn crop was in the cribs and Sunnyside Farm\r\nwas down to a winter basis. The crop had averaged sixty-five bushels\r\nof shelled corn to the acre, and only one other farm belonging to Mr.\r\nBronson--and that a very well tilled one indeed--had done better, or as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nHiram's success with corn (which was, indeed, the principal reason for\r\nhis having been put in charge of the farm by Mr. Bronson) was all the\r\nmore to be commended because of the conditions under which the young\r\nfellow had undertaken this present contract. Hiram had been obliged to\r\nchange radically the methods of corn growing he had followed in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nJust as the old-time farmer who hand-hoed his cornfield learned to\r\nthrow away the hoe and use the cultivator, horse-hoe, and fluke-harrow,\r\nso these big corn growers had developed a method of cultivation quite\r\nat variance with that of the small farmer cultivating but a few acres.\r\n\r\nHiram had discovered that by rotation of crops which kept down the\r\nweeds corn could be cultivated with a riding harrow drawn by two\r\nor three Percherons that could do twice the work in a day of three\r\nordinary horses worked to single cultivators, and with the saving of\r\ntwo men's time.\r\n\r\nIn addition to learning and following these new methods and in some\r\ncases improving on them, Hiram had kept more than a rough farm account.\r\nHe knew his overhead charges against each crop. It cost him more per\r\nacre, for instance, to prepare his field for the seed corn he had shown\r\nDaniel Brown; but that particular field paid him in increased yield. It\r\nran ten bushels per acre over the remainder of the farm.\r\n\r\nThe cribs were bursting with corn. Mr. Bronson had long since got over\r\nhis first objection to the red ear and the occasional mottled one.\r\nThis corn would ship to any distance after it was well dried and lose\r\npractically no weight in the journey.\r\n\r\nHe proposed to hold Hiram's crop this year until mid-winter, or later,\r\nwhen the price would certainly advance.\r\n\r\n\"I am satisfied that your methods have made me money, Hiram,\" said his\r\nemployer, on one occasion. \"You don't know everything. Nobody does. But\r\nthere is one very good thing about you. You are not too old to learn!\"\r\nand Mr. Bronson laughed.\r\n\r\nHowever, all this occurred before that letter came from Sister which\r\nso excited Hiram's curiosity. That the same Cincinnati lawyer should\r\nhave to do with the search for the lost Cheltenham boy and for the\r\nmysterious Theodore Chester, was a coincidence that, Hiram decided,\r\nmust needs be looked into.\r\n\r\n\"Strayed boys are not so common as all that,\" he thought.\r\n\r\nHe sat down and wrote to Mr. Eben Craddock at the address the lawyer\r\nhad given him, asking if he had found Theodore Chester, just who that\r\nmysterious individual was, and if the lost Cheltenham boy--first name\r\nunknown--had any connection with Mr. Craddock's former inquiry at\r\nSunnyside Farm.\r\n\r\nAs it chanced, another matter came up before Hiram received any reply\r\nfrom Craddock, which proved to be a very surprising incident and one\r\nthat for the time being quite drove thought of his letter to Craddock\r\nout of Hiram's mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson was buying young stock--calves and yearlings--all the time\r\nto swell the number of the herd Hiram was feeding, and with which he\r\nwas so successfully enriching Sunnyside. Sometimes the farm's owner, or\r\none of his men, brought the new live stock to Hiram. At other times\r\nthe former owners of the calves delivered them.\r\n\r\nIt was on a day early in December that a big farm wagon with a\r\ncattle-rack in it was driven into the yard. The boys were living again\r\nin the house, and had the furnace fire going, for Mr. Bronson had just\r\nhad the house decorated and wished it to be kept well heated. Hiram\r\nleft his comfortable seat before the dining room register, and went out\r\nto meet the wagon. Orrin and Jim were both down at the cattle sheds.\r\n\r\nThe moment Hiram drew near the wagon in which the calves bawled he\r\nrecognized the driver and the latter knew him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" exclaimed the bewhiskered man whom Hiram believed to have\r\nbeen the employer of his assistant whom he knew as \"Orrin Post.\" \"Are\r\nyou still here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am on the job still,\" answered Hiram smiling.\r\n\r\n\"I was told to ask for Mr. Strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you do run this here Sunnyside Farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are correctly informed, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they tell me you've grown the biggest crop of corn and the\r\nheaviest wheat ever seen on this land,\" said the bearded man from\r\nbeyond Pringleton.\r\n\r\n\"We've done right well here this year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well! Well, I've got six calves here, Mr. Stephen Bronson bought\r\nand told me to deliver to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Drive down that road beside the barn, if you will. We will\r\nunload them at the calf pens.\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped upon the wagon at the rear to look at the calves and ride\r\ndown to the place indicated. All the time he was wondering what would\r\nhappen if the bewhiskered man should spy Orrin--if the real Orrin Post\r\nshould confront the young man who claimed that name.\r\n\r\nOught he to have prepared his friend for this meeting? Should he\r\ninquire of the farmer what the mystery was all about, anyway?\r\n\r\nHiram remembered how Orrin had slipped out of the house and kept away\r\nwhen this farmer and the lawyer had appeared at Sunnyside the previous\r\nwinter. What would he do now?\r\n\r\nAnd just then the teamster turned the trotting horses into the paddock\r\nand brought them to a standstill with a flourish.\r\n\r\n\"Whoa, there!\" he shouted. \"Where do you want these calves put, Mr.\r\nStrong? Here, you--By crippity! how the deuce did you come here, Ted\r\nChester?\"\r\n\r\nHiram jumped off the rear of the wagon and ran around. Leaning on a\r\nfork the young man he knew as Orrin Post confronted the farmer.\r\n\r\n\"So it is you, is it, Mr. Post?\" the younger man said.\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say you've been here all this time? And that lawyer and me\r\nhave been right here and asked--\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he swung to look at Hiram. He shook a finger at him.\r\n\r\n\"What did you mean by telling me and that lawyer you didn't know this\r\nfellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not. You did not make me understand that this was the man you\r\nwere looking for,\" declared Hiram without looking at his friend.\r\n\r\n\"You were holding out on us,\" said the farmer. \"You made me lose a\r\nfifty-dollar note.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"That lawyer promised it to me if we found Ted, here. And now I don't\r\nsuppose he'll give a cent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anybody would be mighty foolish to give fifty dollars for me,\" broke\r\nin the man who appeared to be the missing Theodore Chester.\r\n\r\n\"What do they want you for, anyway?\" Hiram demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know?\" Hiram asked the original Orrin Post.\r\n\r\n\"That lawyer did not tell me. But if this fellow, Ted Chester, hadn't\r\nleft me flat--\"\r\n\r\n\"If you hadn't put me out when I was taken sick, I suppose you would\r\nhave got the reward,\" said the accused.\r\n\r\n\"But why should anybody offer a reward for you?\" Hiram asked him again.\r\n\r\n\"Because they want me, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do they want you for? And who wants you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! I'm not going to tell everybody that,\" said the other, with a\r\nside glance at the bearded man, indicating that Post was the person he\r\ndid not care to confide in.\r\n\r\n\"Well, is your name Theodore Chester?\" Hiram asked in some desperation.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is. At least, that is what I have always called myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you know, Ted, I always treated you right,\" began the bearded man.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram stopped him. He waved a commanding hand.\r\n\r\n\"Get those calves into that pen. If Ted wants to talk to you, he can\r\ndo so afterward. But it doesn't seem to me as though it was any of our\r\nbusiness whether he is Ted Chester or somebody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I tell you right now,\" growled the farmer. \"I ain't going to\r\nlose that fifty if I can help it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the calves were unloaded and the real Orrin Post had driven away\r\ngrumbling, Ted Chester--if that was his name--turned to look at Hiram\r\nin rather a sheepish fashion.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you think it's up to me to explain, Strong?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am curious,\" admitted Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, you, thinking my name was Orrin Post until now--\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I might as well tell you that I suspected you had been known as\r\nTed Chester about a year ago,\" interrupted Hiram, and he told him how\r\nhe had come to that belief.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is a fact. That was Orrin Post. I worked for him. He is\r\nthe man who chased me when I was sick. I don't know how I came to\r\ngive you his name, unless it was because he was on my mind. And in my\r\nopinion--then, at least--one name was as good as another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there any reason why you were afraid to use this one of Chester?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that I did not want to be traced.\"\r\n\r\n\"By whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"By anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you knew,\" said Hiram thoughtfully, \"that somebody was after you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was told so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who does that lawyer represent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang it all, Hiram!\" exclaimed the other, \"I have been in a reform\r\nschool. Back East. I ran away. I never had any bringing up--much. Only\r\nfor a couple of years I lived with nice people. Then I got into trouble\r\nand was arrested. I stayed in the reform school some time.\"\r\n\r\n\"This must have happened a good while ago,\" guessed Hiram shrewdly.\r\n\r\n\"I was only nineteen when I ran away from the institution.\"\r\n\r\n\"The authorities cannot be searching for you through that lawyer,\"\r\ndeclared Hiram. \"It must be for something else you are wanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I never thought of that,\" murmured his friend.\r\n\r\n\"Who were your people?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. First I remember I was in an orphanage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just like Sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so,\" said the other.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know 'Theodore Chester' is your name?\" demanded Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that is what they called me. No! Not altogether,\" he added. \"I\r\nsaw the books once and I know they had me down as 'Ted C.' They always\r\ncalled me Ted. I named myself Chester.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as Sister names her brother--and herself for that matter,\"\r\nmuttered Hiram. \"Say, Orrin--I mean, Ted! Suppose your name should be\r\nthe same as Sister's?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Strong?\" cried the other.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose your real name is 'Cheltenham,' too?\" propounded Hiram Strong\r\nshrewdly. \"Stranger things have happened, don't you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? You mean that I may be Sister's brother?\" demanded Ted. \"What\r\nnonsense! Why, she told me her brother was a little boy--younger than\r\nshe is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lots she knows about it!\" rejoined Hiram excitedly. \"She doesn't\r\nknow anything more about her brother than you know about yourself.\r\nOrrin--Ted--whatever your name is. This matter has got to be looked\r\ninto! Right away, too!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                             LOOKING AHEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nLater the reticent Ted opened his heart to his friend and told him of\r\nall his checkered life previous to his coming to Sunnyside Farm.\r\n\r\nIt was by no means a strange story; except that he was forced to live\r\nin a public institution, the management of which chanced to be in\r\nrather hard, unsympathetic hands.\r\n\r\nTheodore could remember a little of what had happened to him before he\r\nwas incarcerated in that first institution with its stone walls and\r\nstrict discipline, and a government scarcely paternal.\r\n\r\nHe could remember that he had had a little sister, too, whom he loved\r\nvery much and whom he looked after and carried about in his arms. But\r\nthey had taken her from him in the orphanage and he had become \"Ted C.\"\r\nHe never was allowed to see his little sister again.\r\n\r\nAt twelve years old he was taken by a family who treated him well and\r\nwho sent him to school and taught him for a few short years what the\r\n\"worth while\" things in life were. Then illness and death in the family\r\ncost the boy his home, and he had to struggle for himself. He was soon\r\npicked up by the police and the magistrate sent him to the reform\r\nschool, as there was nobody to speak for him.\r\n\r\nHow Ted had kept a clean heart during these troubled years was a\r\nmystery. There was something, Hiram believed, innately good in the\r\nfellow. Like Sister, he possessed traits of character that disposed him\r\ntoward good rather than toward evil.\r\n\r\nBut his experiences made him reticent and suspicious. After he ran away\r\nfrom the reform school he never wholly trusted people he met. In the\r\ncity he was always in fear of the police, as well as of his associates\r\nin the reform school who likewise had got out. He was afraid they would\r\nget him into further trouble. So he went out into the country and\r\nworked his way west from farm to farm.\r\n\r\nThat he really was Theodore Cheltenham was soon established through\r\nletters from the Eastern lawyer who had the matter in charge. At\r\nChristmas time both he and Hiram were relieved from duty, and they went\r\nto Scoville to spend the holidays at the Atterson farm and to settle\r\nwith the lawyer about the legacy left to Ted and his sister.\r\n\r\nSister's name, by the way, was Mary, but she always called herself\r\n\"Mary Cecilia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I've got money and a brother, both,\" Sister said to Hiram, \"I am\r\nsomebody. I wish Mr. Fred Crackit and Mr. Peebles and all those others\r\nat the boarding house in Crawberry knew about it--and that boy who used\r\nto pull my pigtails so.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, Hiram Strong, what a lucky girl I am.\"\r\n\r\nShe would have been glad to keep her brother with her in the East, for\r\nshe was very fond of him already. But Theodore's thoughts were set on\r\nSunnyside. He had immediately written to Mr. Bronson, making an offer\r\nfor the farm, having money enough as his share of his grandmother's\r\nlegacy to make a first payment on the place. And, in time, Sunnyside\r\nFarm became Ted Cheltenham's property.\r\n\r\nThe two young fellows returned to Pringleton after New Year's to take\r\nup their work. Hiram's contract with Mr. Bronson had still some months\r\nto run, and it was arranged that he should put in the corn crop and\r\ncontinue a personal oversight of the farm until after wheat harvest.\r\nFor Hiram had a stake in that wheat crop; and while he was making\r\narrangements for his own great venture, the particulars of which will\r\nbe related in \"Hiram in the Great Northwest,\" he intended to keep a\r\nsharp eye on Yancey Battick's famous wheat.\r\n\r\nThat winter, whenever it was open weather, both Hiram and Battick\r\nsearched the fields for the pest that had attacked the Staff of Life\r\nWheat during the previous season. Some of the farmers around the Banks\r\nplace had their grain well-nigh eaten up by the pest, but none appeared\r\nagain on Sunnyside. There was no danger of Adam Banks spreading the\r\ngrain louse to other fields, if he had been guilty of it before, for\r\nBanks had finally come to the attention of the police and had been put\r\nin jail.\r\n\r\n\"And the right place for him,\" declared Miss Pringle. \"He has made\r\ntrouble enough about here.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Pringle's own interest in the new wheat was abiding since she had\r\nhelped in its sale during the summer. And by this time she showed an\r\ninordinate interest in everything belonging to Yancey Battick.\r\n\r\nThe latter had \"spruced up,\" as Hiram called it, a good deal of late.\r\nHe was no longer playing the hermit. His success with the Staff of Life\r\nWheat made him forget his failure with the Mortgage Lifter Oats, and\r\nreally made a new man of Yancey Battick.\r\n\r\n\"And mark my words,\" Ted Cheltenham said, laughing, when Hiram said\r\nthis, \"that new man is looking for a new woman. I can't go over to\r\nDelia's in the evening without finding Yancey Battick occupying her\r\nbest rocker. I don't know but Abigail will leave Miss Pringle flat. She\r\nstill believes Battick has the evil eye.\"\r\n\r\nThis winter did not pass without Hiram being invited to one of Lettie\r\nBronson's parties. This time the young girl saw to it that Ted was\r\nasked too, for she rode up to Sunnyside herself to deliver the\r\ninvitation to the social function by word of mouth.\r\n\r\nOf course they agreed to go. Hiram would not have hurt Lettie's\r\nfeelings for anything, and she was much in earnest. As for Ted, he\r\nseemed to have prepared for this very occasion while he was East.\r\n\r\nAt least, he displayed a handsome suit of evening clothes and asked\r\nHiram if he was not going to wear his own dress suit. Hiram hauled the\r\nsuit in question out of his trunk and carefully examined it. In his\r\neyes the clothes looked just the same as they had when he laid them\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Jim,\" he said to Larry. \"You and I are about of a size. I make\r\nyou a free-will offering of these--pants, coat and vest! Somehow, I\r\ndon't fancy my appearance in the 'soup to nuts.' My figure is not built\r\nright for such garments. I am sure no tailor could make Hiram Strong\r\nlook as though he belonged in a suit of this kind.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was right. At least, nobody considered him out of place when\r\nhe arrived at the Bronson house and appeared as one of the few men who\r\nwere not in evening dress.\r\n\r\nIn another matter Hiram showed wisdom on this occasion. Lettie was just\r\nas kind to him as she always had been. He might have had three or four\r\ndances with her. He accepted two, and sat them out with her in a corner\r\nof the conservatory, although Ted Cheltenham danced with every girl he\r\ncould find--and danced well.\r\n\r\n\"You are a funny boy, Hiram Strong,\" said Lettie, looking at him\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, preferring to sit here rather than to getting out on that\r\nbeautifully waxed floor,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I would be 'funnier' there than I look here,\" he replied grimly. \"I\r\nknow my failings better than I used to, Lettie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Hiram!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure I do. I am only going to tackle in the future what I have a fair\r\nchance to accomplish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot imagine you as a failure in anything, Hiram,\" she, told him\r\nvery prettily.\r\n\r\n\"No? I can imagine myself failing in lots of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not in this new venture you are making? Father says you have\r\nwonderful pluck to attempt to go out into that strange country and risk\r\nyour last cent on a wheat ranch.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it does look like a gamble,\" admitted Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"And father says he would be glad to help you get started here, as\r\nOrrin--I mean, Theodore--is starting.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is kind of your father, I know,\" agreed Hiram. \"But I guess I am\r\nin a hurry. I may be glad to come back and take a job with your father\r\nagain. But it will only be after I have spent every cent I own on this\r\nnew venture.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have made good here, Hiram,\" she said, with some wistfulness\r\nin her voice and her look. \"Don't you think you would better stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't think of it, Lettie. My plans are all made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not--not if all your friends here asked you to?\" she ventured.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I am sure,\" Hiram laughed, but remembering in secret how Sister\r\nhad finally wished him Godspeed, \"that none of my real friends would\r\nwant to keep me back from this thing, when I am so set on it and have\r\nbeen so long planning for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps not,\" she sighed. \"Here comes Theodore, looking for me,\r\nHiram. I have promised him the next dance.\"\r\n\r\nShe arose, and Hiram watched her float away in the arms of his friend.\r\nFor a moment he felt a stab of--was it jealousy? Or was it just a\r\nfeeling of homesickness as he contemplated so soon leaving everybody\r\nhe knew and cared for, to lose himself in the vast wheat fields of the\r\nGreat Northwest?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n    [Transcriber's Note: Inconsistent hyphenation left as printed.]",
