Too far gone!--The Antelope at the Mercy of the Winds and Waves._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE waters of the Atlantic Ocean were reddened far and wide by the rays\r\nof the rising sun. The glorious beams had flashed over tract after tract\r\nof the watery expanse as they came from the east, until at length they\r\npoured in a full blaze upon a certain gay and gallant bark which lay\r\ntossing upon the tide somewhere within a hundred miles or so of the\r\nshore of the western world.\r\n\r\nYet though undeniably gay and gallant, the hand of time was visible on\r\nthat bounding bark. For her buoyant hull was worn, and torn, and aged,\r\nand weather-beaten, and in fact decrepit. Aloft, over that battered\r\nhull, whose dilapidated sides, covered with bruises and bare of paint,\r\nshowed gaping seams, from which the oakum protruded, rose the rickety\r\nmasts and rotten old rigging. The sails, all torn, and worn, and rent,\r\nand patched, were spread to catch the breeze, while on high floated a\r\ngallant but dingy flag, bearing the blazonry of a now undecipherable\r\nemblem, together with letters now half effaced, which looked like “B. O.\r\nW. C.”\r\n\r\nSuch a disreputable craft, and such preposterous sails, had surely never\r\nbefore met the eye of the astonished sun in these waters, and great\r\nmust have been the hardihood, or else the ignorance, of those who\r\ndared commit themselves and her to the merciless ocean. Whether bold\r\nor ignorant, however, there they were, all of them--Captain Corbet,\r\nthe mate, Solomon, and the boys of the “B. O. W. C.;” and these now all\r\nstood on the deck of the Antelope, looking at the reddening dawn.\r\n\r\nAt the helm of his gallant bark stood her bold commander, as wise, as\r\nvigilant, and as care-worn as ever, shading his venerable brow with his\r\nhand, while, with eagle eye, he sought to make out some floating object\r\nor some friendly shore. But to that eagle eye the wide waste of waters\r\nshowed nothing of the kind; and so it came to pass that, at length,\r\nthe aged Corbet heaved a gentle sigh, and his eyes rested with mournful\r\nmeaning upon his young companions.\r\n\r\n“Well, captain,” said Bart, who was standing near him, “we don’t seem to\r\nhave made land yet--do we?”\r\n\r\nThe captain shook his head slowly and solemnly. “Kine o’ curous, too,”\r\n he ejaculated, after a thoughtful pause.\r\n\r\n“I don’t suppose you have any more idea of where we are than you had\r\nyesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, “not to say much of an idea; but I’m kine o’\r\ncomin round, an mebbe I’ll get the hang of it yet.”\r\n\r\n“Well, why not head her west? We’ll be sure to come in sight of land\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\nAgain the captain shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I don’t know,” said he, “about that. Thar’s currents, an thar’s\r\neddies; an thar’s the Gulf Stream to be considered. Now, if we’d kep\r\nstraight on at fust, when we got out o’ Canso, we’d been all right;\r\nor even after we left Louisbourg, ef we’d only kep along the coast, in\r\nsight--but thar’s the mischief of it. I let her git out o’ sight o’ land\r\nthat night, an she got kine o’ slewed round, and ’s kep kine o’ cantin\r\nround every which way, until at last she’s in this here onfort’nit\r\nposition. An now I’m all teetotally aderrift!”\r\n\r\n“O, I shouldn’t think that we can be more than a hundred miles or so\r\nsouth-east of the Nova Scotia coast.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, I don’t know; seems to me we may jest as well be off Bermudy as\r\nanywhars else.”\r\n\r\n“Bermuda!” exclaimed Bart, in amazement. “You don’t mean that.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, I don’t see why not. Here we air, after a kerrewsin around a\r\nwhole fortnight every which way, driven up an down by wind an tide, an\r\ncanterin along with the Gulf Stream; an whenever, we ventured to hail\r\na passin vessel, only gettin the finger o’ scorn a pinted at us for our\r\npains, an the laughter of frivolous an light-minded men. So what’s to\r\nhender us from bein anywhars?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, “don’t you think it would be better to take some one\r\ncourse, and stick to it?”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t I done it?” said the captain. “Ain’t I done it every day? Every\r\nday I took some definite course, and stuck to it; an what’s the result?\r\nYoung sir, if you seek a answer, look around.”\r\n\r\n“But something must be done,” said Bart, “or else we’ll find the\r\nAntelope becoming a second edition of the Flying Dutchman. A fortnight\r\nof this sort of thing’s no joke.”\r\n\r\n“Who ever said it was?” said Captain Corbet. “An what’s wuss, every\r\npassin vessel will pussist in makin it a joke. They think we’re a fishin\r\nschooner, bound to the banks; an if we ask a honest question, they won’t\r\ndo anything but yell out jokes that ain’t got any pint that ever I can\r\nsee. Wal, this sarves me right, for ever ventrin outside of old Fundy.\r\nPut me in old Fundy an I’m all right; out here I ain’t any good, an\r\nhadn’t ought ever to dreamt of comin.”\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that the ill-fated Antelope was once more in a\r\nmost unpleasant predicament, and the company on board appeared in danger\r\nof encountering adventures of as unpleasant a kind as they had known in\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence, if not worse. And certainly the prospect was\r\ndark indeed, when the captain himself could go so far as to hint at\r\nBermuda as being by any possibility in their neighborhood. So Bart\r\nthought; and as he walked away there was a shade of anxiety on his brow.\r\n\r\nAs he walked forward he saw Solomon drawing some water for breakfast out\r\nof one of the barrels.\r\n\r\n“Solomon,” asked Bart, “how are we off for provisions this time?”\r\n\r\nThe sable functionary raised his aged form, and, holding the water-pail\r\nin one hand, with the other he slowly scratched his venerable wool.\r\n\r\n“Wal, Masr Bart,” said he, “dis yar time we ain’t got no ’tiklar cause\r\nfor ’ziety. Dar’s a barl of salt pork, an two barls of biscuit, an dat\r\nar’s ’ficient for de ’quirements of dis yar company. Lucky for us,\r\ntoo, dat Cap’n Fuggeson cars for us. He put this pork an biscuit aboard\r\nfor extry, an say dat we all boun to come to roonatium some how. An dat\r\nar am de very ’visiums dat we got to lib on now.”\r\n\r\n“But haven’t we got anything better than salt pork and biscuit left?”\r\n asked Bart, in a rueful tone.\r\n\r\n“Well, notin ’tiklar. Dar’s a drawin or two ob tea--an a grain or two\r\nob flour--an some red her’n; but, law sakes! child alive--what you mean\r\nby frettin and pinin so long’s dar’s lot to eat? Neb-ber you mind. I’ll\r\ncook up dis yar pork so ’s you’ll blieve it’s roast turkey. Will so.\r\nYou don’t know me yet. Tell you what,--wait till you see how I cook up\r\ndis yar.”\r\n\r\n“O, I know,” said Bart; “I believe you could feed us on saw-dust soup,\r\nif you hadn’t anything else. It wasn’t that.”\r\n\r\n“Saw-dust soup!” cried Solomon. His eyes rolled fearfully. His aged\r\nfigure bent double. He put the pail of water down, and then seated\r\nhimself on the deck, where he proceeded to shake his venerable sides,\r\nand swing his body backward and forward, while chuckles, and giggles,\r\nand choking laughter burst from him. Every little while, as he could\r\nget his breath, he would roll up the whites of his eyes with a look of\r\necstasy, and whisper to himself, “Saw-dust soup!--saw-dust soup!--dat’s\r\nso. Tell you what! takes ole Solomon to do it. He’s de boy. Is so! Yah,\r\nyah, yah!”\r\n\r\nFrom this outburst of African sentiment Bart turned mournfully away, and\r\nstood apart, looking pensively upon the water. The other boys seemed to\r\nfeel as he did, for they all had on their faces an expression of anxiety\r\nand disappointment. They all knew how they were situated, and the\r\nsituation was not agreeable to any one of them. Whatever novelty there\r\nmay have been in it had gone off long ago, and there was nothing now\r\nleft but impatience and vexation of spirit.\r\n\r\nThe wind had been freshening during the night; and now, as the day\r\nadvanced, it grew more and more boisterous.\r\n\r\n“It’s blowin a leetle mite too fresh,” said Captain Corbet to Bruce,\r\n“for to contennew on this course; so I’ll jest come round, an run afore\r\nit. Arter all, it’s the best course,--for it’s west, an had ought\r\nto fetch us up somewhar eventooly, though I ain’t got overly much\r\nconfidence in this here compass.”\r\n\r\n“Compass! Why, what’s the matter with the compass?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Wal, yesterday at sunrise,” said Captain Corbet, in a gentle tone of\r\nregret, “I noticed that, accordin to the compass, the sun was a risin\r\nin the nothe, an that was agin natur. So I knowed that either the\r\nsun was wrong or the compass, and nat’r’ly concluded that it was the\r\ncompass. So I jest examined it, an sure enough, I found the needle all\r\nrusted up; an I’m a leetle mite afeared it ain’t no more good, jest now,\r\nthan a rusty nail. Consequently, I don’t feel like settin any very\r\ngreat confidence on her. Wal, for that matter, I never thought much of\r\ncompasses, an don’t gen’rally go by them when I’m in old Fundy, though\r\nhere-, abouts they might p’aps be some use.”\r\n\r\nAt this fresh instance of Captain Corbet’s way of navigating, Bruce was\r\nso overwhelmed that he could not say a single word. A flush passed\r\nover his face. His lips parted as though he was about to speak; but he\r\nchecked the rising remark, and walked forward, where he began to talk\r\nearnestly with the other boys.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly their conversation was interrupted. There was a sharp\r\ncrash, a wild flap, a dark shadow, and in an instant a large object\r\nfloated away through the air on the wings of the wind, while the noise\r\nof flapping, snapping, and cracking still filled their ears. A hurried,\r\nstartled glance showed them all. As the Antelope was coming round, a\r\ngust of wind more violent than usual had struck her. The old sails were\r\ntoo weak to stand it. The mainsail yielded utterly, and was torn clean\r\noff, and flung away upon the waters. The foresail had suffered but\r\nlittle less injury, for it had been torn completely asunder, and now\r\nshowed a huge rent, while the two portions flapped wildly and furiously\r\nin the blast.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, “ef--this--here--don’t--beat--all!”\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment, and stood contemplating the ruin before him.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” he continued, drawing a long breath, “what’s got to be must be.\r\nI knowed it would come some day. You can’t fight agin the wind an storm\r\nfor more’n seventeen year without feelin it; and these sails has been an\r\nhad their day. I knowed it. I told you, boys, once--I dar say you\r\nmind the time--that them sails might be stronger, and that they wasn’t\r\nadapted to be hung on to a ship of a thousand ton. Still I did hope that\r\nthey’d stand this here vyge.”\r\n\r\n“But what are we going to do now, captain?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Do?” said the captain. “O, wal, ’tain’t so bad’s it might be. We’ve\r\ngot the foresail yet; an me and Wade ’ll fix her; we’ll take her, an sew\r\nher up, and make her as good as new; an we’ll work along some how. You\r\nneedn’t be troubled; it ain’t goin to make a mite of difference; an I\r\ndon’t know, after all, but what in the long run p’aps it’s a goin to\r\nbe better for us. We ain’t ben a doin much with the two sails, that\r\nsartain; p’aps now we’ll do better with only one.”\r\n\r\nAnd now the venerable captain and his noble mate prepared to obtain\r\npossession of the sail. This was done without any very great effort, the\r\nboys all assisting. Then the two navigators (master and mate), having\r\narmed themselves with sail-needles and twine, proceeded to sew up the\r\nrent, to patch, to mend, and, in general, to renovate the old, old\r\nwornout sail. At length this last was happily accomplished; the sail\r\nwas restored to its place, and as it swelled out at the pressure of the\r\nocean blast, it seemed as efficient as ever. But either, in this case,\r\nappearances were deceptive, or else its previous condition had been\r\ndeplorably weak. Certain it is, that after having sustained the blast\r\nfor about half an hour, the old rag of a sail began to give way again in\r\na dozen different places, and at length split up almost close beside the\r\nformer rent. At this Captain Corbet surveyed the tattered canvas with\r\nmelancholy resignation.\r\n\r\n“This here wind,” said he, “is a leetle too stiff for her jest now. I\r\nthink we’d better save her from another time. She’ll do very well in\r\nmilder weather.”\r\n\r\nBy “she” Captain Corbet meant the sail, which he thus personified with\r\naffectionate familiarity. As he said this, he proceeded to lower\r\nthe tattered canvas, and examine it in a pitying, compassionate, and\r\ncaressing sort of way, quite oblivious of any other duty.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Antelope tossed and pitched about at the mercy of the\r\nwaves. There was nothing that deserved the name of a storm; yet,\r\nnevertheless, the wind was boisterous, and the sea somewhat rough.\r\nThe position of the Antelope became, therefore, in the highest degree\r\nunpleasant, and this last example of Captain Corbet’s helplessness and\r\nincapacity served to complete the despondency of the boys. It now seemed\r\nas though their last hope had gone. The compass was useless; the sails\r\nwere reduced to rags; they had no means of flight from their present\r\nmisery; and the only comfort remaining was, that the danger which\r\nmenaced them was not immediate, and might yet be evaded.\r\n\r\nNothing now was left to the boys but to watch with eager eyes the scene\r\naround--to search over the waste of waters with the hope of seeing some\r\nsail, or perhaps some sign of land. And to this they devoted themselves.\r\nIt was indeed a cheerless task, and one, too, which gave them but little\r\nhope. Hours passed, yet no sail appeared. Dinner time came, and the\r\ndinner was spread; yet the boys showed but little appetite. They\r\nhad been in far worse circumstances than this, yet still this was\r\nsufficiently unpleasant to destroy all relish for Solomon’s cookery,\r\neven if the banquet had been composed of greater dainties than salt pork\r\nand sea biscuit.\r\n\r\nThus the guests at that banquet were not at all appreciative; and they\r\nsat there in the schooner’s hold, not to eat, but merely to pass the\r\ntime, which hung so heavy on their hands. Yet even thus their impatience\r\ndid not allow them to spend much time at the dinner, for they soon\r\nretreated, and took up their stations on deck once more, to stare\r\naround, to scan the horizon, and to peer into empty space.\r\n\r\nHours passed. On that afternoon, the wind gradually went down, and there\r\nseemed a prospect of calmer weather. Captain Corbet began to talk of\r\nmending the sail, and hoisting it again; and at length, calling upon\r\nWade, he and his mate proceeded with needles and sail twine to patch up\r\nas before. Into this occupation these two plunged, but the boys still\r\nstood on the lookout.\r\n\r\nAt length, Bart directed Bruce’s attention to something which appeared\r\non the margin of the sea, far away on the horizon.\r\n\r\n“Bruce,” said he, “don’t you see something out there that looks like the\r\nmast of a vessel?”\r\n\r\nBruce looked eagerly in the direction where Bart was pointing, and the\r\nothers, who had heard the remark, did the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_A strange and startling Sight.--A Mast in Midocean.--Land.--A Land of\r\nTerror.--A Panic.--The worst Place in all the World.--Tom drives away\r\nthe Panic.--Drifting.--The Anchor dropped.--The Dawn of Day.--The low\r\nLand on the Horizon.--Preparing to go ashore.--The Confidences of the\r\nunfortunate Solomon._\r\n\r\n\r\nAS they all stood looking in the direction where Bart was pointing,--\r\n\r\n“I see it,” said Bruce. “It’s certainly the mast, and the mast of a\r\nship, for there is the yard and the rigging; but there’s only one mast.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a sloop,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Tom; “it’s a square-rigged vessel of some sort.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an it ain’t got no more ’n one mast,” said Pat; “an be the same\r\ntoken, there’s no hull at all at all. Be the powers, but it would be a\r\nquare thing intirely if it was to turrun out to be another wather-logged\r\nship. An if it is, it’s meself that’ll not set fut aboord of her; not\r\nme, so it isn’t.”\r\n\r\n“There’s something,” said Bruce, “that may be a hull. I can see it\r\nsometimes quite plain. Now look, boys, carefully, all of you, as we rise\r\non the top of a wave.”\r\n\r\nAll this time Arthur had been examining the object through the\r\nspy-glass. As Bruce said this, he handed the glass to him.\r\n\r\n“It’s not a ship,” said he, “nor a vessel of any kind. It’s land.”\r\n\r\n“Land!” cried all the boys.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\nAll were silent. Bruce took a look through the glass, and then passed it\r\nto Bart, who, after looking through it, passed it on to the others.\r\n\r\n“It’s a fact,” said Bruce. “It’s land; and that’s a flag-staff.”\r\n\r\n“It’s very low land,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“It’s a mere sand-bank,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“A sand-bank,” said Bart, “with a flag-staff in the middle of the ocean!\r\nIt’s queer.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bruce; “and remember this, too, that this sand-bank in the\r\nocean, with this flagstaff, is probably not very far away from the coast\r\nof Nova Scotia. Now, put this and that together, boys, and where do you\r\nthink we are?”\r\n\r\nAt this question they all looked at one another in silence, and for a\r\ntime no answer was made.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Tom, at length, “I’ll tell you what it is, boys. I believe\r\nthat another prophecy of Captain Ferguson’s is turning out true. He\r\nprophesied that we’d be thrown upon Anticosti, and so we were. He\r\nprophesied that we’d be thrown on another place, and this is that place.\r\nYou all know what I mean. I mean Sable Island.”\r\n\r\nThe boys made no remark. This thought had been in the minds of all of\r\nthem. It was a thought that brought the deepest anxiety and gloom. For,\r\nbad as Anticosti was, there was one worse place; and that place was the\r\nvery sand-bank before them--Sable Island!\r\n\r\nThe boys had all along been hoping for deliverance, either in the shape\r\nof some passing vessel or some sign of land. But this land, which they\r\nhad approached unwittingly, seemed to be surrounded by a terror far\r\nworse than anything that was connected with their present situation. For\r\nSable Island--that treacherous sand-bank in the midst of the sea--had\r\nalways been known to all of them as the dread of seamen, the trap of\r\nships, and the graveyard of shipwrecked sailors. The solitary flag-staff\r\nrose there out of the low island, as though to warn them away, like\r\na signal of danger; and yet it was impossible for them to move away.\r\nWithout sails, and without a compass, they were helpless; and there\r\nseemed now no prospect, except to go ashore there and meet their doom.\r\n\r\nTom was the first to rouse himself. “Captain,” said he, “here’s Sable\r\nIsland. Come and take a good look at it, for we’re going ashore.”\r\n Captain Corbet had been so intent upon his work of patching the old\r\nsail, that he had heard and seen nothing of this excitement among the\r\nboys. These words of Tom came, therefore, suddenly and abruptly, and\r\nfilled him with a terror equal to theirs. He started as though he had\r\nbeen shot. His needle dropped from his hands. For a few moments he sat\r\nstaring at Tom; and then he rose slowly to his feet, and going over to\r\nwhere the boys stood, he looked out over the waters to where their eyes\r\nwere directed. He stood staring for a long time in perfect silence.\r\n\r\n“Sable Island!” he at length said, in a low voice. “Wal, boys,--I didn’t\r\never think--I’d ever live--to see--this here day. I’ve ben a tryin all\r\nmy life, boys, to keep clar of this here island; but fate’s stronger\r\nthan the hand of man,--an here we air!”\r\n\r\n“O, see here now,” said Tom. “Come, now, captain, this here sort of\r\nthing won’t do at all, you know. There can’t be any very great danger.\r\nThe wind’s gone down, you know. The sea’s ever so much smoother than\r\nit was, and it’s going to be smoother still. All sorts of vessels visit\r\nthis island. The Nova Scotia government send supplies here regularly;\r\nand so I don’t see what danger there is. For my part, I think we’d all\r\nbetter go ashore. The more I think of it, the more convinced I am that\r\nwe’ll be better off ashore on Sable Island than we are drifting about\r\non board of the Antelope. And so I say, Hurrah, boys, for Sable Island!\r\nLet’s go ashore, and get a decent sail for this vessel, and some\r\nsupplies.”\r\n\r\nThese words cheered the boys amazingly. A reaction at once took place.\r\nTom was right. The sea was calm enough here to admit of a landing\r\nanywhere: and in the face of this fact thoughts of danger were not to be\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\nYet the panic which had been inspired by the very name of Sable Island\r\nmay easily be explained; and, in circumstances like these, it was quite\r\njustifiable. For of all places in the world, Sable Island is, perhaps,\r\nmost dreaded by seamen. It is a low sand-bank, about twenty miles long\r\nand one mile wide. This much is above water. But besides what is visible\r\nto the eye, there is much more invisible, treacherous, beneath the sea,\r\nextending all around it. Sable Island is, in fact, the crest of a vast\r\nsand-bank or shoal, which rises out of the ocean depths, about a hundred\r\nmiles southeast of the coast of Nova Scotia, in the very track of the\r\nvast commerce between England and America. Though the island itself is\r\nnot more than twenty miles long, the shoal extends much farther; and it\r\nhas been calculated that, for a distance of fifty miles, there is danger\r\nto the ship which ventures too near. Moreover, this shoal runs in a\r\ncurved line, and may be said to enclose in a segment of a dangerous\r\ncircle all vessels sailing north of it, or between it and the main land.\r\nApproach to it in a storm is always dangerous; and with certain winds\r\nit is positive destruction; wherefore ships always give it a wide berth.\r\nMany are the vessels which are known to have been lost there; but many\r\nmore, by far, are supposed to have perished on the outlying shoals,\r\nwithout leaving a vestige behind to tell of their fate.\r\n\r\nNow, however, there was nothing like a storm. The wind, that had\r\nprevailed all day, was gone; and it only needed Tom’s cheery words\r\nto drive away from all of them the terror that for a time had taken\r\npossession of their souls. They therefore roused themselves from the\r\nsilence and the gloom into which they had fallen, and began to talk over\r\nthe probabilities of a landing. Each one brought forth all that he knew\r\nabout Sable Island, and added it to the common stock of knowledge, until\r\nat length a very favorable idea of the place was formed. Bart knew that\r\nthere was a regular overseer, or governor, or superintendent of the\r\nisland, placed there by the Nova Scotia government. Bruce knew that a\r\nvessel was sent there four times a year to convey supplies, and to take\r\naway any shipwrecked people who might be there. Arthur knew that there\r\nwere huts, built for the purposes of refuge, in different parts of the\r\nisland. Tom was sure that a landing could be made in ordinary weather,\r\nwithout much trouble; and Phil was eloquent on the subject of the ponies\r\nwhich live and thrive on the island, constituting a peculiar breed, well\r\nknown in Nova Scotia, where a batch of Sable Island ponies are brought\r\nevery year, sold at auction, and dispersed through the country. The\r\nresult of this interchange of ideas was, that the boys at length began\r\nto look upon Sable Island as rather a desirable place, and to feel\r\nimpatient for the time to come when they might drift near enough to make\r\na landing.\r\n\r\nBut this was a thing for which they had to wait. The Antelope was\r\ncertainly drifting; yet her progress was slow, and there was no way of\r\nhastening it. For hour after hour they watched the flag-staff, and the\r\nlow line of land away on the horizon, without finding themselves near\r\nenough to think of going ashore. By the shifting and changing position\r\nof the flag-staff, they knew that they were drifting past it; and yet\r\nthere was no way by which they could prevent this. In the first moments\r\nof their panic, the possibility of drifting clear of Sable Island would\r\nhave seemed most welcome to all of them; but now that they had formed\r\nthe plan of landing there, such a prospect seemed not at all desirable;\r\nand the slow drift of the schooner, while it baffled their hopes, filled\r\nthem all with impatience.\r\n\r\nIn this way the hours of the day passed away. It was about three o’clock\r\nin the afternoon when they first saw Sable Island. The hours went by,\r\nand sunset came; still they were not near enough. Night was impending,\r\nyet the weather was too calm to allow of uneasiness, and they could only\r\nhope that on the following day they might be able to make the landing\r\nwhich they all desired so earnestly.\r\n\r\nPassing the night in the vicinity of such a place as Sable Island is\r\nwhat few would choose for any amount of money. On this occasion, most\r\nfortunately, the weather was calm. The wind had died away to a gentle\r\nbreeze, and the water was quite smooth. The only motion experienced by\r\nthose on board the Antelope was that long rise and fall which is always\r\nfelt out at sea, owing to the never-ending undulation of the ocean\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nThe boys went below and slept. Captain Corbet, however, remained on\r\ndeck, and kept his lonely vigil far into the night. The first mention\r\nof Sable Island had produced upon him a profound effect. His first words\r\nexhibited something like a panic terror, which might have communicated\r\nitself to the boys, had it not been for Tom’s cheery exhortation. From\r\nthat first terror the captain had managed to extricate himself; yet\r\nstill there remained, deep within his soul, the gloomiest anticipations.\r\nThe night was not particularly dark. The sky was dotted with innumerable\r\nstars; yet so low was the island, and so destitute of any conspicuous\r\nlandmark, that it passed out of view with the early twilight; nor was\r\nthe eagle eye of the watchful Corbet able to detect any sign of the\r\nvanished land. At length he determined to guard against the danger of\r\nany further drifting, and accordingly proceeded to let fall the anchor.\r\nIt was about two hours after midnight when this was done, and the rattle\r\nof the chains awaked the sleepers below, and announced that at last\r\ntheir long wanderings were arrested.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning they were all on deck with the dawn of day, and\r\nlooking out eagerly upon the waters. The sight which met their eyes was\r\none which could have given nothing like pleasure to any others; yet to\r\nthem it was indeed pleasant, so far as it went. They saw rising out\r\nof the sea a low, sandy shore, which extended as far as the eye could\r\nreach. About opposite them rose a flag-staff, which they supposed to be\r\nthe one that they had seen on the previous evening, though there was a\r\ndifference of a most important character between what they saw then\r\nand now. For here they saw buildings which looked like comfortable\r\nresidences, perhaps the abode of the keeper of the island. Except this\r\nhouse and its belongings, nothing else was visible along that sandy\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope had come to anchor in good time, and the shore was not\r\nquite two miles away from this place. Still, so shallow were the waters,\r\nand so treacherous the sea bottom, that it was not at all advisable to\r\nattempt to approach nearer. If they wished to land, they would have to\r\ndo so in the boat. The boat floated astern, all ready, being no other\r\nthan that one which they had saved from the ship Petrel. Into this they\r\nprepared to go.\r\n\r\nFor this voyage all the boys volunteered, and Captain Corbet also. Wade\r\nwas to be left aboard with Solomon. Bart noticed that the venerable\r\nAfrican was looking at the island with a pensive gaze, and thought that\r\nhe saw disappointment in his face.\r\n\r\n“Would you like to come ashore, too, Solomon?” he asked, kindly.\r\n\r\nSolomon shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Darsn’t,” said he. “Darsn’t, no how.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh, nonsense! Why not? Come along,” said Bart, who thought that this\r\nwas some of Solomon’s superstitious fancies which were now affecting\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Darsn’t,” said Solomon, again. “Couldn’t ebber leave it agin. An don\r\nyou go an try to ’suade dis yer ole man, Mas’r Bart, if you don want\r\nto lose him. Tell you what--dat ar island’s too safe; an ef I foun\r\nmyself dar, I wouldn’t ebber leave it.”\r\n\r\n“Safe? What from?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\nSolomon looked all around with the glance of one who fears pursuit and\r\ncapture by some mysterious enemy.\r\n\r\n“De ole complaint,” said he at last, with a groan.\r\n\r\n“What, rheumatism?” asked Bart, innocently.\r\n\r\n“No, sah,” said Solomon. “It’s Broom-atiz--an acute Broomatiz too--what\r\nI notches from de ole woman whenebber she finds a broomstick handy.\r\nIt generally attacks me over de back and shoulders. An what’s wuss, dar\r\nain’t a medicine, or a liniment, or a wash, or a poultice, dat does a\r\nmite ob good. De only cure is for me to go an hunt up some desert island\r\nin de middle ob de ocean, an habit it for do ress ob my days; an so,\r\nef I was to go shore dar, I might hide, an nebber come back. Too great\r\n’tractium; couldn’t resist it. Safe dar forebbermo from dat ar ole\r\nwoman; safe an free; no more knocks an bruises; no more terror. O, Mas’r\r\nBart, p’raps, after all, dis here ole man better go asho dar, an hab\r\npeace.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Solomon,” said Bart, who was astonished at learning the real\r\ncause of Solomon’s strange fancy for Sable Island. “Nonsense. Don’t get\r\nthat notion into your head. Your wife ’ll never find you. You come to\r\nGrand Pré, and Dr. Porter will protect you.”\r\n\r\n“Dat ar place is de berry place whar I kin nebber be safe. She’s dar\r\nnow, a waitin, an a watch-in, an a waitin for me. I know it. I feel it\r\nin my ole bones. Dey allers aches when I think ob her. Ebery mile we go\r\nbrings me nearer to her broom-handle; an de longer I stay away, de wuss\r\nI’m goin to cotch it. So, p’raps, Mas’r Bart, I’d better go asho on\r\nSable Island.”\r\n\r\nThe idea seemed to have taken full possession of Solomon’s mind, and\r\nto such an extent, that Bart found all efforts to banish it utterly\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nHe therefore gave it up, and concluded, under the circumstances, that it\r\nwas better for Solomon to remain on board.\r\n\r\nThe boat was now ready. The boys and Captain Corbet were calling for\r\nBart to hurry up. Bart got on board, and they pulled away. It was a long\r\npull; but the water was smooth, and they made good progress. At length\r\nthe boat touched the shore, and they all leaped out upon the sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_Landing.--A friendly Reception, and a bounteous Repast.--Sable\r\nIsland.--The strange Soil.--The sandy Ridge.--The Lake.--The long\r\nWalk.--A wonderful Sight.--The ancient Ship.--The Governor’s Story.--A\r\ntremendous Storm and its Effects.--A great Surprise.--Examination\r\nand Exhumation.--Disappointment.--Theories.--The Governor rides a\r\nHobby-horse._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN they stepped ashore upon Sable Island they found themselves in\r\nthe presence of the whole of the population. This population amounted\r\nto about eleven souls; namely, the governor, or keeper, or guardian,\r\nor regent, or whatever else he may be called, of the island, six of the\r\nmembers of his family of various ages, and four able-bodied men. The\r\ngovernor was a bluff, broad-shouldered, red-faced, bearded personage,\r\nwith a bright gray eye and a cheery smile. He had a reefing-jacket\r\nand “sou’-wester” hat; while his four satellites were dressed, two\r\nin reefers, and two in Guernsey jackets. The intercourse of the Sable\r\nIslanders with the outside world was very infrequent, and usually very\r\nexciting, so that on the present occasion they had turned out in force\r\nto greet their extraordinary visitors.\r\n\r\nNot far off was a substantial and comfortable-looking house, that seemed\r\nwell adapted to withstand the Atlantic storms, and shelter its inmates\r\nfrom the severity of the weather. A few small out-houses adjoined it,\r\nand in the distance, where the ground rose a little higher than usual,\r\nwas the signal-staff already mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhatever doubts the visitors might have had about the reception which\r\nthey would meet with were dispelled at once and utterly by the first\r\nwords of the potentate, whom I will call the “Governor.” Without\r\nany remark as to the suddenness of their appearance, and without any\r\nquestion about their errand, he at once shook hands with them all round,\r\nand invited them to the house to breakfast, which, he informed them, was\r\nall ready, and waiting for them. A long and dreary voyage and monotonous\r\nsea life made a meal on shore seem attractive beyond expression to all\r\nof them, and the kind invitation was most thankfully accepted. Whereupon\r\nthe governor led the way to the house above-mentioned, and ushered his\r\nvisitors into a large but low room, where a long table was spread,\r\nand lay invitingly before their eyes. Here they seated themselves, and\r\npartook of the governor’s Sable Island hospitality, in the shape of\r\nfragrant coffee, and hot rolls, and baked potatoes, and corned beef and\r\ntongue, with other articles too numerous to mention; all of which served\r\nto efface from the minds of the guests the memory of late hardships,\r\nand to diffuse among them a general feeling of peace and calm, of\r\ncheerfulness and content.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this repast the visitors made known to the governor\r\ntheir whole story, and that story was heard by him with an astonishment\r\nwhich he did not attempt to conceal. The fact that they should have been\r\ndrifting blindly about without finding any place of refuge, and that\r\nthey had finally been forced to seek for help from him in this place,\r\nof all others, was so overwhelming, that at first he seemed unable to\r\nbelieve it; and even after he had been compelled to yield his faith, his\r\nreason remained unsatisfied. The thing was true, yet unintelligible, and\r\nto his mind simply preposterous. Yet there was the fact, and here\r\nwere the factors, that went to constitute that fact. The governor was\r\ndumfounded. Captain Corbet was clearly beyond him.\r\n\r\nAt length, like a wise man, he gave up the attempt to fathom what was\r\ninscrutable, and devoted himself rather to the practical duties of\r\nhospitality. He promised to let Captain Corbet have what he wanted, and\r\nalso he offered to do the honors of Sable Island, and show the boys all\r\nthat was worth seeing.\r\n\r\nThe governor was thus not only hospitable, but also very communicative.\r\nHe told them all about Sable Island, and gave them much information, in\r\naddition to what they had already learned about this singular place.\r\n\r\nThe little colony was placed here for the purpose of giving aid and\r\ncomfort to any who might be unfortunate enough to be shipwrecked here.\r\nFull supplies of all sorts of stores and provisions were placed on the\r\nisland under his care. In addition to the buildings at this place there\r\nwere two other houses of refuge, farther away towards the east, and also\r\ntwo other signal-staffs. In the other houses of refuge no one lived, but\r\nsupplies of food and fuel were laid up there for the benefit of those\r\nwho might need them. There was no lighthouse, because it was believed\r\nthat a light might have a tendency to mislead, and because all seamen\r\nsought to keep as far away as possible from the island.\r\n\r\nSable Island, in fact, is nothing more than the ridge of a vast\r\nsand-bank, which rises from the ocean depths, and at this place emerges\r\nfor a few feet above its surface. The sandy ridge is over twenty miles\r\nin length, and is curved in its form. The shallows at either extremity\r\nalso follow this curved line, so that the whole extent of this place\r\nof danger, including the shoals as well as the island, is not much less\r\nthan fifty miles. Its concave side is towards the north-west, and ships\r\non that side in stormy weather are in great peril whenever they come\r\nwithin twenty miles of the place. As a consequence, many wrecks occur,\r\nsome of which are known, while more are never heard of, and can only be\r\nconjectured. Caught, so to speak, between the long-extended arms of this\r\ntreacherous sand-bank, they are swept helplessly to destruction among\r\nthe waters that rage over these far-reaching shoals.\r\n\r\nOnce every three months a vessel comes here from Nova Scotia to bring\r\nsupplies and to take off any who may have been cast ashore. The landing\r\nis often difficult, and sometimes impossible, so that the vessel has to\r\nkeep away for a long time before daring to venture near.\r\n\r\nThe governor informed them that life here, on the whole, was not\r\nunpleasant, but that in winter there were times when it was impossible\r\nto venture forth out of the house. The cold was never excessive, for the\r\nsurrounding waters made the temperature milder than that of the adjacent\r\nmain land; but the storms were terrific, and sometimes the sea seemed\r\nto make a clean sweep over the island, and all the air was filled with\r\nclouds of driving spray. After such storms as these it was always their\r\npractice to explore the island in search of shipwrecks. Sometimes they\r\nfound human beings, who had been cast ashore, huddled for shelter behind\r\nhillocks, or in the other houses of refuge and brought them back; but\r\nmore frequently the only result of their search was the sight of some\r\nfragments of a lost ship which the furious waves had washed ashore;\r\nor, worse still, the lifeless bodies of those who had perished amid the\r\nraging waters. These last were always conveyed to the burial-ground of\r\nthe island, where they were committed to the grave with solemn ceremony,\r\nthe governor reading over them the burial service of the church.\r\n\r\nThis information and much more was communicated at breakfast; and after\r\nthe repast was over, the governor proceeded to fulfil his promise by\r\ntaking the boys out to show them Sable Island.\r\n\r\nIt did not appear as though there could be much to see. On leaving the\r\nhouse there spread away a sandy waste, whereon grew some coarse grass.\r\nThis grass grew not close enough to form anything like turf, yet in\r\nsufficient abundance to afford pasturage to herds of wild ponies which\r\nbelong to the island. These ponies were put here many years ago, and\r\nin successive generations have become developed into a wonderfully\r\nintelligent and hardy little animal, ugly, woolly, yet strong, and\r\ncapable of feeding on anything. They endure the severity of the winter\r\nseason here without any shelter whatever; and when snow is on the ground\r\nthey get at the grass underneath with the same ready instinct that is\r\nexhibited by the buffaloes on the western prairies.\r\n\r\nAfter walking some distance, they reached the crest of the sand ridge,\r\nand from this place they saw a long, narrow sheet of water. This they\r\nwere informed was a lake, which took up half of the length of the\r\nisland, being more than ten miles in length; the formation of the island\r\nbeing what may be called a long, irregular oval, enclosing this sheet of\r\nwater. The eastern half of the island is, however, a solid, continuous\r\nsand-bank, and the lake lies rather towards its western end.\r\n\r\nIt is the eastern end which is most affected by storms. Here the herbage\r\nis scanter, and the hillocks more frequent; here, too, the sand shifts\r\nand changes with every storm. The governor informed them that after\r\nevery very great storm, important changes might be seen in this\r\ndirection, and mentioned that one of a very interesting nature had\r\noccurred a few months previously in a tremendous equinoctial gale, which\r\nhad been by far the wildest that had taken place since his residence on\r\nthe island. This he promised to show them, and led the way to the place\r\nwhere the object to which he referred might be seen.\r\n\r\nThey walked about four miles, and at length reached a pond which was\r\nabout in the middle of the island, and at an equal distance from either\r\nside. Here a black object arose, which the boys at first took for some\r\nsort of a rock. As they drew nearer, it looked more like a hut; but\r\nfinally, on coming close, they saw, to their utter amazement, that it\r\nwas nothing else than the hull of a ship.\r\n\r\nThat ship had a most singular form. The timbers had been greatly broken,\r\nand the decks had vanished long ago; but the outlines were visible by\r\nthe broken beams, and it seemed to have been about five or six hundred\r\ntons burden. But what most impressed them was the quaint and singular\r\nappearance of the stern. This part had been less injured than the rest.\r\nIt rose to a height of over sixteen feet, and much more was still buried\r\nin the sand. The uppermost portion was battered and broken; but beneath\r\nthis there was a second deck and a third. Between this second deck\r\nand the third was what might once have been a cabin, and the broken\r\nport-holes astern, that once gave light, were still plainly visible.\r\nThe great height of the stern and its division into successive stories,\r\nreminded the boys of the pictures which they had seen of the ships of\r\nthree centuries back, and filled their minds with intense excitement.\r\n\r\n“This ship,” said the governor, “was uncovered by the great gale of last\r\nMarch. Until that time it had been completely covered by the sand, which\r\nformed around it the biggest hillock on the island. I never had any\r\nidea that inside of that hillock there was anything of this sort. I\r\nattributed the formation of the hillock to the accidental concurrence\r\nof the winds which had gathered the sand up here. You would scarcely\r\nbelieve how large it was. Why, for hundreds of yards all around here\r\nthat hill extended, and it was over thirty feet higher than where we now\r\nare.\r\n\r\n“Well, a few days after the great gale, I came out in this direction,\r\nand noticed, to my amazement, that the hill was gone! That didn’t\r\nsurprise me much, for I had known other such changes to take place in\r\nevery storm, though I had never known any on such an extensive scale.\r\nBut when I came nearer, and saw this old hull, you may depend upon it I\r\nwas astonished enough. Here it was,--all laid bare, all the sand blown\r\naway just as you see it now, except the cabin there, which I proceeded\r\nto clear out as soon as I could.\r\n\r\n“Now, the first glance showed me that this old hull must be at least a\r\ncouple of hundred years old; and I took it for one of the old French or\r\nEnglish ships that had been wrecked here in the early days of American\r\ncolonization. I accounted for its position so far inland in the easiest\r\nmanner in the world. The fact is, this whole island is all the time\r\nshifting and changing. I don’t believe it is in the least like what it\r\nused to be. When this ship got here, I believe this was a shoal where\r\nshe drove ashore in some tremendous gale, and was soon covered up with\r\nsand. Gradually the sand gathered about her more and more, and the\r\nisland changed its shape, and the shoal rose above the water, till at\r\nlast this place became the middle of the island. Two or three hundred\r\nyears from this, I dare say there’ll be miles of land away off there to\r\nthe north, all along, and this’ll be considered the South Shore.”\r\n\r\n“But didn’t you find anything aboard of her?” asked Bart, in eager\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n“Well, that was the very first thing I thought of. This old-fashioned\r\nship reminded me of the Spanish galleons that used to take cargoes of\r\ngold and silver across the water, and I was full of the idea that there\r\nmight be some immense treasure still on board. The sand had preserved\r\nthe wood from decay, and gold was still more likely to be preserved. So\r\nI hurried back at once, and got a shovel, and came here alone. I cleared\r\nout the whole cabin there that day, and to my deep disappointment, I\r\nfound not one single thing. I found it, in fact, just as you see it\r\nnow--completely cleaned out by the waves. Everything had gone, except\r\nthe timbers and some of the deck work. Doors had been torn off, and\r\nthe whole front of the quarterdeck had been forced away. There were no\r\nmovables of any kind, nothing, in fact, except those beams and planks,\r\nthat had been strong enough to resist the fury of the waves.\r\n\r\n“I went back that day in deep disappointment, and gave up all hope of\r\nfinding anything. On the following day I called all hands together, and\r\nwe all came here to examine the hull. We worked for about a week, and\r\ndug out most of the sand,--it’s all back again, though, you see,--and in\r\nother places we thrust in poles to see if anything was there. We found\r\nnothing, however; no gold or silver, no precious stones; nothing, in\r\nfact, but a rusty, demoralized, and depraved old cannon, that looked as\r\nthough it had been cast for the Spanish Armada. The old piece is over\r\nthere in the house, preserved as a curiosity.”\r\n\r\n“And so you didn’t get anything?” said Bruce, in a tone of\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n“Not a thing, except the cannon,” said the governor; “and I leave you\r\nto imagine my disappointment. I was at first sure of making my fortune,\r\nretiring from the island at once, and going home to live on my wealth.\r\nBut I’m afraid I shall have to postpone that for a long time.”\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose there ever was any treasure on board of her?” asked\r\nArthur.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes. I not only suppose so, but I almost feel certain that at one\r\ntime there was a good deal of gold and silver aboard of this very ship.\r\nI’ve examined her, and studied her very attentively. Look at her now\r\nfor yourselves. Notice how high that stern is. I don’t think those high\r\nsterns were used later than the days of Queen Elizabeth. It was in just\r\nsuch ships as this that the Spaniards brought their gold and silver\r\nacross the water. In fact, boys, I believe that this is neither more nor\r\nless than a Spanish galleon. Believe? in fact I know it. For on that old\r\ngun that I spoke of, there is a cast that’s precisely the same that you\r\nsee on the old Spanish dollars--the arms of Spain.\r\n\r\n“Now I’ll tell you what the idea is that I’ve formed about this ship.\r\nYou know that in the days of Elizabeth the Spanish Main swarmed with\r\nbuccaneers, who seized the treasure ships whenever they could. Among\r\nthese, English sailors were the worst. You know that well enough. Well,\r\nmy idea is, that some of these buccaneers seized this very galleon,\r\nplundered her of everything, and let her go. I don’t think that a\r\nSpanish ship would have been likely to be driven up here from the West\r\nIndies, or to drift here. I think it most likely that she was seized and\r\nbrought here.”\r\n\r\n“But perhaps,” said Bart, “the buccaneers were lost in her.”\r\n\r\n“It’s possible, certainly,” said the governor, “but I don’t quite think\r\nit. I think, if there had been any gold left, some of it would have been\r\nleft hereabouts in the hull. No. I think it most likely that she has\r\nbeen plundered by the buccaneers, who then let her go,--for a big,\r\nclumsy ship, like this, was no good for their purposes. They may have\r\nlet the Spanish sailors go in her,--not unlikely; and if so, the poor\r\nwretches left their bones in these sands.”\r\n\r\n“But what would buccaneers come here for?” asked Bart,--“so far to the\r\nnorth. I thought they all lived around the Spanish Main.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the governor, “that brings up the very point that proves my\r\nwhole theory.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n_The Buccaneers.--The Traditions of Mahone Bay.--The Spanish\r\nGalleon.--The buried Treasure of the Buccaneers.--The Plunder of\r\nthe Spanish Main.--The lost Ship.--The Arms of the royal House of\r\nSpain.--Convincing Proof.--Further Wanderings.--Undisciplined Ponies.--A\r\nlast Farewell.--The Antelope departs.--The Plan of the Boys.--Corbet\r\ngrieves, but yields.--Out of the Reach of Danger._\r\n\r\n\r\n[YOU must be aware, in the first place,” said the governor, “that over\r\nthe whole Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia there are traditions of the\r\nbuccaneers. There is one place, however, where these traditions seem\r\nto have a centre, and that is Mahone Bay. The people there have handed\r\nthese traditions on from father to son ever since the country was\r\nsettled; and the belief at this time, is as strong as ever, if not\r\nstronger. The only change that they have made is in the name. They do\r\nnot speak of the buccaneers but of one certain man, whose name all over\r\nAmerica seems to have lent itself to every tradition that the past has\r\nhanded down about pirates and piracy. This is Captain Kidd. So at Mahone\r\nBay the traditions all refer to him.\r\n\r\n“Now I don’t believe that these traditions originated in nothing, but\r\nthat they grew out of actual facts. The buccaneers, when they infested\r\nthe Spanish Main, needed some place in which to store their plunder.\r\nThey wanted a place which was at once safe from pursuit, and so remote\r\nthat the Spaniards would never think of following them. Well, this they\r\ncould gain by sailing far enough to the north, and Nova Scotia naturally\r\nseemed the best stopping-place; first, because it seemed to them like\r\nthe last point of the coast of the main land, and secondly, because it\r\nwas convenient for a run over to Europe. Besides, Nova Scotia afforded\r\na greater number of first-rate harbors than could be found in any part,\r\nnot only of America, but of the world. It was therefore out of the way\r\nof pursuit and discovery, and the best place that they could wish to\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, among all the harbors that line the coast of Nova Scotia,\r\nthere isn’t any that can be compared to Mahone Bay for the purposes\r\nof the buccaneers. Once in it, and discovery or capture is next to\r\nimpossible. The bay is spacious and deep, without shoals or currents,\r\nand, above all, dotted with three hundred and sixty-five islands of\r\nevery sort and size. Among these a hiding-place could be found, that for\r\nsafety and seclusion could not be equalled anywhere else. And what are\r\nthe facts? Why, the tradition of the country ever since asserts that\r\nthis very bay was a chosen haunt of pirates in the old piratical days.\r\n\r\n“And what’s more,” continued the governor, “this tradition isn’t vague\r\nand general, but it’s direct and specific. It points to some one place\r\nthere,--one of those islands in particular that is distinguished from\r\nall the other islands. I don’t know the name of it; I don’t know that I\r\never heard it; but I do know that there is such an island,--one of those\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five, that is pointed out and well known as the\r\nplace frequented by the buccaneers. Everybody says, that on this island\r\nthey lived, and that in this island, deep down,--under the level of the\r\nsea, in fact,--the buccaneers buried the plunder of the Spanish Main.\r\n\r\n“Of course, as I said, they don’t speak of the buccaneers, but of\r\nCaptain Kidd. They call it Kidd’s treasure. But it’s all the same. The\r\nfact remains whatever changes mere names may undergo. Now, mind you, I\r\ndon’t say that there’s any treasure there now,--it may have been all dug\r\nup by the very men who buried it, or by others who knew about it. It’s\r\na long time since it was buried, and Mahone Bay had no settlements for\r\ngenerations. At the same time it’s quite probable that it may be there\r\nstill; and I, for my part, shouldn’t be a bit surprised to hear at any\r\ntime that some lucky fellow has got hold of it all.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you never went to Mahone Bay yourself,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Well, no,” said the governor. “The fact is, I never thought much about\r\nit until lately, after the old galleon set me speculating about it; and\r\nthen I remembered old things that I had heard. Go there?--O, no!--I’m\r\ntoo old. If I were a young man, without a family, I’d make a dash at it;\r\nbut now it’s impossible. I’d have to give up my situation. O. no! I dare\r\nsay somebody’ll make his fortune there one day; but that’ll never be my\r\nluck. And as for treasure, I believe that there’s lots of it deep under\r\nthese sands, all about, if one only knew where to dig--but that’s the\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n“And so, you see, that’s the conclusion I’ve come to--putting this and\r\nthat together. This is a Spanish galleon. Here she is,--ever so far\r\nout of the course which the treasure ships of the Indies usually\r\nfollowed,--up here in these seas, in close proximity to the most\r\nnotorious haunt of the old buccaneers. Do you suppose they had nothing\r\nto do with this? Of course they had--everything. In those days no ship\r\nin these waters could have escaped their eyes, much less a big Spanish\r\nship full of gold and silver. Mark my words. As I said at first, they\r\ncaptured her, brought her here, unloaded her, buried her gold and her\r\nsilver in Mahone Bay somewhere--on that island that I spoke of, and then\r\nlet the ship go.”\r\n\r\nThis notion of the governor’s might have been critically examined and\r\nutterly disproved by a competent person; but for such a task the boys\r\nwere too ignorant and inexperienced. The firm belief of the governor in\r\nhis extraordinary theory affected every one of the boys most profoundly;\r\nnor could any of them see a reason why it should not be perfectly true\r\nin every particular. Every word that he had uttered sank deep into their\r\nsouls, and every one of them felt himself filled with an irresistible\r\ndesire to hurry off at once to Mahone Bay, and seek for the island where\r\nthe buccaneers had buried the plunder of the Spanish Main.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion they poured upon him a torrent of questions of\r\nall sorts, every one of which showed how attentively they had listened\r\nto his story, and how eager the curiosity was which they all felt. The\r\ngovernor answered everything with the minuteness and the exactness that\r\ncharacterize a man when he finds that his own particular hobby meets\r\nwith respectful appreciation from others.\r\n\r\nAt length they turned back to the house, talking all the way about\r\nSpanish galleons, treasure ships, the buccaneers, gold, silver,\r\ndiamonds, the Spanish Main, and the various haunts of the old\r\nmarauders--subjects fascinating above all things to these boys, as they\r\nare to all boys, so fascinating indeed, that they were sorry when they\r\ncame back to the house. Here, however, another pleasure awaited them,\r\nfor the governor showed them the very gun that he had found on the old\r\nship, and pointed with respectful pride to certain marks upon it. The\r\ngun was terribly rusty, and the marks had been so effaced that they were\r\ncapable of being interpreted to mean anything; but the governor assured\r\nthem that they were the escutcheon of the Royal House of Spain, and the\r\nboys believed it implicitly. Other and more critical inquirers would\r\nhave asked what the governor meant by the arms of the Royal House\r\nof Spain, and inquired whether he meant the house of Arragon, or of\r\nHapsburg, or of Bourbon. To the boys, however, such a question never\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThe water was still calm; but Sable Island is a place where no one can\r\nstay long. The governor therefore hurried up the venerable Corbet,--who,\r\non this as on other occasions, seemed to give indications of a dilatory\r\ndisposition,--and furnished him with some sails, which, with a little\r\nalteration, would suit the Antelope very well. Upon this Corbet returned\r\nin his boat to the schooner, carrying the sails with him, and one of\r\nthe Sable Islanders to help him rig the sails. The boys were to be put\r\naboard by the governor later in the day.\r\n\r\nThey then went off with their genial host to other parts of the island.\r\nThis journey was made on ponies which had been broken, yet not so much\r\nbut that they retained a very fair share of their original wildness. The\r\nriding was not very conducive to speed. All of the boys were thrown, but\r\nnone of them were hurt on the sandy soil, and the governor made\r\nhimself merry over their horsemanship. As to scenery, there was nothing\r\ndifferent from what they had already encountered, except numerous wild\r\nfowl that frequented the lake.\r\n\r\nBy the time that they returned they saw the Antelope with her sails\r\nfilled, and a boat drawn up on the beach to convey them aboard. The\r\ngovernor shook hands with them all most heartily on bidding them good\r\nby.\r\n\r\n“Good by, my lads,” said he. “I’m the most unhappy of men in one way.\r\nAlthough I keep shipwrecked guests an immense time, I dare not be\r\nhospitable to visitors. I would press you to stay all night, but I’m\r\nafraid to. If you had a better craft, and a better captain, I might\r\nventure to do it; but even then it wouldn’t be safe. As it is, it would\r\nbe madness, and my only parting word to you is, to hurry away as fast as\r\nyou can, and get away as far as possible from Sable Island.”\r\n\r\nThe boys got on board; the sturdy Sable Islanders bent to their oars,\r\nand soon their vigorous strokes drove the boat far out to sea. But all\r\nthe way the boys could see the little group on the shore watching them.\r\nOn reaching the Antelope, they found all ready for a start. The\r\nSable Islander who had accompanied Captain Corbet returned with his\r\ncompanions; and as the Antelope moved away, the flag of the B. O. W. C.\r\nwent up and down rapidly, and three ringing cheers burst forth from the\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nSo ended their very remarkable and eventful visit to the most fearful\r\nand dangerous of all the islands of the sea. Few, indeed, are the\r\nvessels which, having drifted upon this perilous coast, are able to\r\nleave it so safely, and so pleasantly. For Sable Island generally\r\nsurrounds itself with destroying terrors for those who chance upon it;\r\nand more than Anticosti, more, indeed, than any other place, deserves\r\nthe dread name of--“the graveyard of ships and sailors.”\r\n\r\nIn turning away, there was now but one thought in the minds of all the\r\nboys, and that was, of course, Mahone Bay. In any case they would sail\r\nstraight for the coast of Nova Scotia; and Mahone Bay was the only place\r\nat which they were willing to land. There was now no further difficulty\r\nabout making their way, for the governor, in addition to the sails, had\r\nfurnished a compass also.\r\n\r\n“The Nova Scotia coast,” said Captain Corbet, “air doo north by west, an\r\nit ain’t more’n a hundred mile. The wind’s fair, an we ought to sight it\r\nbefore--well, before three days.”\r\n\r\n“O, we’ll do it long before that,” said Bart, “if this wind lasts. But\r\nwhy can’t you head due west for Mahone Bay?”\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, “there air severial reasons why: fust an\r\nfurmost, because, ef I sail west, I’ll have to coast along this here\r\nshore, which is the very thing I don’t want to do. I want to get as far\r\naway as I kin, an as quick as I kin. Second, I don’t want to go in the\r\ndark no longer. I want to sight the Nova Scotia coast, and then to keep\r\nit in sight till I die. Never agin do I want to git out o’ sight o’ Nova\r\nScotia. Then, third, I don’t want to stop at no more places, but to\r\ncontennew along my windin way, till I git to Minas. An, fourthly, I don’t\r\nwant to go to Mahone Bay at all.”\r\n\r\n“Not go to Mahone Bay!” cried Bruce. “Why not? Why, we want to hunt up\r\nthat island that the buccaneers buried the treasure in.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet looked at all the boys with an expression of solemn\r\nregret, mingled with mild reproach upon his venerable face. Then shaking\r\nhis head mournfully, he slowly ejaculated,--\r\n\r\n“O, boys, boys!”\r\n\r\n“Well, why not?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“O, boys! O, boys!” continued the captain, in a dismal tone. “An has it\r\ncome to this? Air this the end an the melankilly result of the bitter\r\nteachins that you’ve ben an had by sea an land?”\r\n\r\n“Bitter teachings?” said Bart; “what bitter teachings?”\r\n\r\n“The teachins, an the warnins, an the experiences,” said Captain Corbet,\r\n“that’s ben a heaped upon you’s all. Why this thirst for perishable\r\ntreasures? Why this yearnin for money-holes? Hain’t you had enough of\r\ntreasures, and dreams of wealth? Look aime, boys. Behold this wretched\r\nvictuim of Avarice. Think how the demon of Avarice got possession of me\r\nin the Gulf of St. Lawrence, an drawed me away captive to his chariot\r\nwheels. Think how he tempted me to desert you, an leave you in\r\ntremenjous danger. Bar all this in mind, I humbly beg, and then desist.\r\nSay no more. Temp me not. Leave the aged Corbet be. Don’t inflame this\r\nbeaten heart. Be wise in time. You’ll only suffer for it ef you don’t.\r\nThat thar treasure is onhallowed. Didn’t we try diggin for buried\r\ntreasures once afore? Answer me that. We did. An what was the result? I\r\npause for a reply.”\r\n\r\n“O, but this is different,” said Bart. “That money-hole on the hill was\r\nall nonsense; and, besides, what was it then frightened us, except a\r\nmiserable little donkey? This is a different matter. There ought to be\r\nsomething there, out of all the plunder of the Spanish Main.\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk about plunder, and the Spanish Main,” said the captain. “The\r\nway that that governor had of rollin out them words of his was somethin\r\nthat made a man feel a tinglin all over. It’s the thirst for gold,\r\nboys; don’t kindle it up to a flame; don’t temp me agin my better natur:\r\ndon’t, don’t.”\r\n\r\n“O, see here now, captain,” said Bart; “don’t look at things in that\r\nway. When you left us on the ship, it wasn’t Avarice; it was because you\r\nhadn’t any idea that we were in danger.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head. “No,” said he,\r\n\r\n“It was Avarice, the Demon of Gold---nothing else. It blinded my eye, an\r\nhardened my heart. It’s the way it allus does.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t see how you can call it Avarice. You only wanted money\r\nfor your baby--you know.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of his tender offspring, Captain Corbet’s face changed;\r\na mild and mellow light beamed in his aged eye, and a tender parental\r\nfondness was visible in the expression of his venerable face.\r\n\r\n“Terew!” said he; “terew--as gospel!”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, you must feel as anxious about him now as you were then.\r\nYou failed that time; perhaps this time you’ll succeed. And only think\r\nhow jolly it would be, if you could make his fortune, and give him a\r\ncollege education.”\r\n\r\nAt this crafty allusion to Captain Corbet’s fondest hope, the aged\r\nnavigator was overcome. His eyes became moistened with tears; a gentle\r\nsigh escaped him; he said no more, and all the boys saw that his silence\r\nmeant consent.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope was heading towards the nearest point on the Nova Scotia\r\nshore. That shore lay almost north, or north by west, and it was about a\r\nhundred miles distant. The wind was fair; there was no prospect whatever\r\nof a change for the worse; and so the Antelope walked the waters, as\r\nusual, like a thing of life, while the boys amused themselves with\r\nrecalling the strange story of the governor of Sable Island, and\r\nin speculating about the probable appearance of that island of the\r\nbuccaneers, which, according to him, had been the deposit and the\r\nburial-place of the plunder of the Spanish Main.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope did her best. The wind was not very strong, yet it bore her\r\nalong as fast as she was capable of going; no very great rate of speed,\r\nto be sure, yet fast enough to assure them, by sunset, that they were\r\nalready far enough away from Sable Island to be out of the reach of\r\ndanger; out of the grasp of its far-reaching arms, and in a pathway\r\nwhich brought them every moment nearer to a friendly shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n_Land again.--A Line of Coast.--How to navigate.--Plans for finding the\r\nIsland of Treasure.--The Bays.--The populous Island.--The old Man and\r\nhis Ox Cart.--Ironbound.--Tancook.--The cautious Questions of Bruce.--\r\nAn obtuse old Man.--A Confidence from Solomon.--A useless Search.--A\r\nChange of Policy.--How to find the Island._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE wind continued fair, and during the following night the Antelope\r\nkept on her course. On the following day, by noon, they came within\r\nsight of land, and the distant coastline running along the horizon\r\nshowed them now what course they should take. Captain Corbet now headed\r\nher a few points farther to the west.\r\n\r\n“I’m all right now,” said he. “Jest you let me see the Nova Scotia\r\ncoast, and I’ll foller it. Here we go now, an our motter air, On’ard an\r\nup’ard.”\r\n\r\n“Downward, rather than upward, is my motto,” said Bart; “for I’m bound\r\nto get to the bottom of the treasure of the buccaneers. At any rate we\r\nought to find out the truth about it; for the saying is, that truth lies\r\nat the bottom of a well, and a money-hole isn’t very far different.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think you can manage to find Mahone Bay, captain?” asked Bruce,\r\nwith a very natural doubt about Captain Corbet’s capacity to find his\r\nway to a strange place.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he,”’pears to me easy enough, with this here coast-line\r\nto guide us. You see all we’ve got to do is, to keep on along this here\r\ncoast till we come to Halifax harbor. Wal, we don’t go in thar, but keep\r\nstraighten. Wal, the next place is Margaret’s Bay. That’s easy enough;\r\nand then the next place is Mahone Bay. So you see it’s so plain that a\r\nchild might guide his tender canoe in safety to such a place as that.”\r\n\r\n“O, I dare say we’ll work our way sooner or later to Mahone Bay,” said\r\nPhil; “but what we are to do after we get there is a thing which, I\r\nconfess, puzzles me a little.”\r\n\r\n“O, we’ll hunt about for the island,” said Bart. “Hunt about?” said\r\nPhil. “But how can we find it? Shall we ask people?”\r\n\r\n“O, no,” said Bruce; “that would never do. It wouldn’t do at all to\r\nlet a single soul know what we are after. They’d all follow us, and\r\ninterfere with us. No; we’ve got to be very cautious.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a fact,” said Tom; “we must keep dark.”\r\n\r\n“O, I dare say,” said Phil; “but how can we find the island?”\r\n\r\n“O, we’ll hunt it up,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“But how can we tell it from Adam, or from any other island?”\r\n\r\n“Sure an that’s aisy enough,” said Pat. “We’re lookin for an island\r\nthat’s got a hole inside of it; an if there’s a hole, sure we’ll know it\r\nby the heap it makes.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Arthur, “we can look about, and if we can’t find any\r\nmarks to guide us, why, then we can make inquiries among the people.”\r\n\r\nWith such vague plans as these, then, the boys looked forward to Mahone\r\nBay, feeling that it was necessary to keep their purpose a profound\r\nsecret, and yet not knowing how to find the island. They were unwilling\r\nto betray their errand by asking questions, and yet without asking how\r\ncould they hope to learn anything? This was a difficulty which they all\r\nfelt, and in the presence of it they could only conclude to be guided\r\nby circumstances.\r\n\r\nA few days passed and the Antelope reached the entrance to Halifax\r\nharbor, which the bold captain recognized, not by any knowledge of his\r\nown, for he had never been here before; not by any chart or observation,\r\nfor he did not own the former, and had not made the latter; but simply\r\nfrom seeing a steamer go up into the land towards a place where the sky\r\nwas black with the smoke of bituminous coal. When he saw that, he said,\r\n“This is Halifax;” and, saying this, he felt secure of his position, and\r\nkept the vessel on due west.\r\n\r\nIt was morning when they passed Halifax. By noon they passed a broad\r\nbay, which they decided to be Margaret’s Bay. By evening they had\r\nreached another broad bay. At its mouth, and well out in the ocean, lay\r\nan island, with black and rocky sides, and wooded top. On sailing inside\r\nof this, they noticed that it was inhabited, and from this point of\r\nview showed houses and farms. A few miles farther on was another island,\r\nwhich was cultivated from one end to the other, and appeared to be\r\nthickly populated. Farther on there appeared other islands, and wooded\r\nshores, and cultivated fields, and high hills.\r\n\r\nThis, they felt sure, was their destination--Ma-hone Bay. The Antelope\r\npassed inside of the second island, and here dropped anchor.\r\n\r\nIt was yet more than an hour before sundown, and the boys went ashore\r\nupon the island nearest to make inquiries, not about the plunder of the\r\nSpanish Main, but merely of a general nature. The island was thickly\r\ninhabited, and on walking a short distance from the beach where they\r\nhad left their boat, they found a road which seemed well travelled, and\r\nappeared to run from one end of the island to the other. In a little\r\nwhile an old man came along on an ox-cart, who bowed with a good-natured\r\nsmile, and remarked that it was a fine evening. To this they assented.\r\n\r\n“What’s the name of this island?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\nUpon being thus questioned, the old man stopped his oxen, and, looking\r\naround upon the young faces before him, he said,--\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“What’s the name of this island?”\r\n\r\n“Tancook,” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“Tancook?” repeated Bruce; “and what’s the name of that other\r\none?”--pointing to the outer island, which they had first encountered.\r\n\r\n“That thar?” said the old man, looking where Bruce pointed,--“that thar?\r\nWhy, we call that thar island by the name of Ironbound.”\r\n\r\nIt was a fine name, a sonorous and at the same time an appropriate name,\r\nand deeply impressed the boys.\r\n\r\n“Fine farming country this,” said Bruce, once more plunging into the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Wal, pooty so so,” said the old man. “We ain’t got no reason to\r\ncomplain; though, what with diphthery, an sich, it’s mighty hard on\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\n“A good many people here, apparently,” continued Bruce, in a lively key.\r\n\r\n“Wal, pooty tol’ble,” said the old man; “’bout a hundred families on\r\nthis here.”\r\n\r\n“Farmers or fishermen?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Wal, a leetle of the one, an a leetle of the tother.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve got a church here too,” continued Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Yas--a meetin-house.”\r\n\r\n“What persuasion is that meeting-house?” asked Bruce, in an anxious\r\ntone of voice, as though the fortunes of the whole party depended on the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n“Wal, mostly Baptist,” said the old man, “though not all. Were kine\r\no’ cut off, an live mostly to ourselves. But Tancook ain’t sich a bad\r\nplace, arter all, and we manage to grub along.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a fine bay around here,” said Bruce, with a grand, patronizing\r\nsweep of his right arm, which seemed meant to include all creation.\r\n\r\n“Yas,” said the old man; “there ain’t nothin like it nowhar. We’ve got\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five islands, of all shapes an sizes, in this\r\nhere bay--one for every day in the year. This here’s the biggest, an the\r\nsmallest isn’t more than a yard long. Yas, it’s a fine bay, an a great\r\nharbor.”\r\n\r\n“Three hundred and sixty-five islands!” exclaimed Bruce, in a tone\r\nof surprise. “Is it possible? And one for every day in the year! How\r\nextraordinary! But is there really that exact number, or is it only\r\nfancy?”\r\n\r\n“Really an truly,” said the old man, with whom this was evidently the\r\ndeepest conviction of his mind. “O, yas, thar’s no mistake or doubt\r\nabout it. They’ve all been counted, over an over; yas, over an\r\nover--over an over.”\r\n\r\n“It’s very strange,” said Bruce. “It’s most extraordinary; and now I\r\ndare say,” he continued, in an insinuating way, “I dare say that, among\r\nso many islands, some of them are well worth a visit. This island of\r\nyours is a perfect wonder--so fertile, so beautiful! Are there any\r\nothers that are like this?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, not to say jest like this; but they’re fine islands, many of\r\nthem, an curous, too. Thar’s some that’s only islands at high tide, bein\r\nconnected with the main land by narrer beaches an shoals at low tide:\r\nan then, agin, thar’s others that’s only islands at low’ tide, bein\r\ncompletely kivered up by the water at high tide; and so it goes; an\r\nsome’s cleared an inhabited, like this; an some’s wild, an kivered with\r\nwoods; an some has only one family on it; an some’s cultivated, but has\r\nno one livin on them; an so we’ve got all sorts, you see, an they’re all\r\nwell wuth visitin. Thar’s Dead Man’s Island, an Quaker Island, an Oak\r\nIsland, an Maple Island, an Ironbound;” and the old man went on\r\nto enumerate dozens of names in addition to these, out of which no\r\nindividual one made any impression on the minds of his hearers.\r\n\r\nThus far Bruce had been questioning the old man chiefly with the hope\r\nthat he might drop some remark which might be of use to them in their\r\nsearch after the treasure island. But no such remark was forthcoming,\r\nand the string of names which was enumerated conveyed no information\r\nwhatever. So Bruce made one more effort, and ventured to come a little\r\nmore to the point.\r\n\r\n“This bay,” said he, “has been a great place for buccaneers--so I’ve\r\nheard. Do you know anything about them? Can you tell me of any island in\r\nparticular that people talk of as being visited by them? There’s one,\r\nI think, that the buccaneers used to visit. Perhaps you’ve heard about\r\nthem, and can tell us the name of the island, and where it is.”\r\n\r\nNow, this was pretty direct; indeed, all the other boys thought that it\r\nwas altogether too direct, especially since they had all concluded\r\nthat it was best not to ask any questions, except those of a general\r\ncharacter. Bart and Tom both nudged Bruce very violently, to rebuke his\r\nrashness; but their nudges had no effect.\r\n\r\nThe old man stared, then frowned, then looked blank, and then frowned\r\nagain. Then he looked at Bruce, and said, in an uncertain, hesitating\r\nway,--\r\n\r\n“Bucker nears?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bruce. “Buccaneers. They used to come here, you know. Lots\r\nof them.”\r\n\r\nThe old man wragged his old head up and down several times.\r\n\r\n“O, yas; I dar say. Buccar nears--an lots of other fish, that’s left us.\r\nThey used to come here in shoals--likewise mackerel; but them days is\r\nover. Sometimes shad an her’n comes here now; but things ain’t as they\r\nused to be, an it’s gittin harder an harder every year for us fishermen.\r\nIt’s as much as a man can do, with farmin and fishin together, to\r\nfind bread an butter for himself an his children. As to\r\nthem--buck--buck--buck--fish, I don’t know. I don’t mind ever hearin\r\nof them, leastways not under that thar name. P’raps they’re a kine’ o’\r\nmackerel; an I only wish they’d come now, as they used to when I was\r\nyoung.”\r\n\r\nAt this extraordinary misapprehension of his meaning, Bruce stared,\r\nand seemed, for a moment, about to explain himself; but the other boys\r\nchecked him, and the old man himself seemed to become suddenly lost in\r\nhis remembrances of those days of youth, which might never be equalled\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n“Won’t you jump in, an take a ride?” said he, at length. “Air you goin\r\nmy way? Ef so, you may as well git a lift as not.”\r\n\r\nThe boys thanked him, and excused themselves. They were not going his\r\nway, but in another direction. A few more words passed, and at length\r\nthe old man bade them good by, whistled up his oxen, and moved\r\nforward. As for the boys, they did not feel inclined to pursue their\r\ninvestigations any further just then.\r\n\r\n“The next time we ask,” said Tom, “we’ll have to talk about Captain\r\nKidd, plump and plain, and then perhaps they’ll understand.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, “I don’t see what use there is in proclaiming to\r\nthe whole world our business. We’d better cruise about for a while, and\r\nexamine for ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“O, well,” said Bruce, “there’s nothing like dropping a quiet hint,\r\ninterrogatively. It may bear fruit in the shape of useful information.”\r\n\r\n“Like the old man’s information about the buccaneer mackerel,” said Tom,\r\nwith a laugh.\r\n\r\nBruce deigned no reply. They waited here a little longer, and, after\r\nstrolling about some distance farther, they went back to the boat, and\r\nreturned to the Antelope.\r\n\r\nThat evening Solomon addressed himself to Bart, secretly and in\r\nconfidence, as the latter happened to be sitting on the windlass, trying\r\nto concoct some plan by which they might find the mysterious island that\r\ncontained the buried treasure of the buccaneers,--the wonderful, the\r\nstupendous, the incalculable plunder of the Spanish Main. To him, thus\r\nmeditating, cogitating, and reflecting, the aged Solomon thus addressed\r\nhimself:--\r\n\r\n“What’s all dis yar new ’posal, Mas’r Bart, ’bout buried treasures,\r\nan tings? ’Pears to me youn all goin mad, an rushin head fo’most into\r\nde jaws ob ’structium. Better look out, I say. Dars no knowin whar\r\ndis yar’s goin to end. Dem dar pirates’ ghosts keep alius a flyin an a\r\nflittin roun de place whar dey bury de treasure, and it ‘ll take more’n\r\nyou boys to tar dat ar plunder out of deir keepin. Dis yar scursion\r\n’bout dis yar bay ain’t goin to end in no good. Dar ain’t a\r\nsuccumstance dat kin favor you; eberyting’s clean agin you; an if you\r\nfine’ de hole whar de treasure’s buried, it’ll only bring roonatium an\r\n’structium.”\r\n\r\n“Solomon,” said Bart, “my aged, venerable, and revered friend, I am\r\ndeeply pained at this exhibition of superstition in one who ought to\r\nhave a soul above ghosts. A man like you, Solomon, who has real evils to\r\nsuffer, who is afflicted by such real calamities as rheumatism, and\r\nwhat you call ‘broomatism,’ ought to have a soul above ghosts. Isn’t\r\nit enough for you to live in perpetual terror about the reappearance of\r\nthat Gorgon who calls you husband, and beats you over the head with\r\na poker, that you must take the trouble to get up a new set of\r\nafflictions, and trot out your superstitious fancies.”\r\n\r\n“Mas’r Bart,” said Solomon, earnestly, “look heah; dis yar ain’t no\r\ncommon ’currence.

He laughed at Solomon’s fears, reminded him of his foolish\r\nbehavior on former occasions, brought to his memory the time when he had\r\nfled from the braying of an ass, and the other occasion when he had fled\r\nfrom the hoot of an owl. But, though Solomon could not help owning that\r\nhe had acted on those occasions with shameful cowardice and folly, yet\r\nthe consciousness of this could not lessen in the slightest degree the\r\nsuperstitious terrors that now filled his breast; and so, as Bart found\r\nhim incorrigible, he had to give up the effort to calm his mind.\r\n\r\nThat night all on board slept more soundly than they had for weeks. The\r\nAntelope was anchored in smooth water, in a secure and sheltered harbor,\r\nnear a friendly land, and no care whatever was in the minds of the boys,\r\nor of the captain. Such perfect freedom from anxiety had not been their\r\nlot for a long time; and in proportion to this peace of mind was the\r\nprofoundness of their sleep.\r\n\r\nOn the following day they cruised all about the bay, keeping ever on the\r\nlookout for the Island of the Buccaneers. But they soon found that the\r\nsearch was hopeless under the conditions which they had imposed upon\r\nthemselves. To seek for what is unknown, and not ask for directions, is\r\nsurely one of the most impracticable of tasks. The experience which they\r\nhad thus far had was enough, and they found themselves compelled either\r\nto give up the search altogether, or else to break through the secrecy\r\nwhich they had imposed upon themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n_The Cruise around the Bay.--A quaint and curious Town.--Sleepy\r\nHollow.--A home-like Inn.--A genial and communicative Landlord.--A\r\ndelicate Manipulation.--Aspotogon and Deep Cove.--Bart enters into an\r\nArgument.--The Landlord plunges into the Subject of Captain Kidd.--A\r\nwonderful Revelation.--The Treasure of the Seas at last.--The Island of\r\ngolden Store._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE cruise around Mahone Bay had thus proved useless, as might have\r\nbeen expected. The search after one island out of hundreds, where the\r\nappearance, and even the name, of that island were unknown to them, was\r\ncertainly an extraordinary piece of folly. Had they allowed themselves\r\nto make direct inquiries, they could have found the island without any\r\ntrouble. But this was the very thing which they were unwilling to do;\r\npartly, as has been said, from the fear of drawing attention to their\r\nproceedings, and of being interrupted or interfered with in some\r\nway; but partly, no doubt, because they found a much greater charm in\r\nmovements which were thus surrounded by mystery. It was appropriate for\r\nthe members of the great secret society of the B. O. W. C. to enter upon\r\nthis new undertaking in secrecy.\r\n\r\nBut now this had to be given up, and they concluded to go ashore at the\r\nchief settlement of the bay, and make inquiries. In these inquiries they\r\nresolved still to maintain their secret as far as possible, and not to\r\ndivulge it unless it was absolutely necessary; they determined to\r\nhint, rather than ask, and obtain information indirectly, rather than\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\nThe chief settlement of Mahone Bay is the town of Chester, one of the\r\ngreatest curiosities in America. It is not a settlement. It is a town.\r\nIt is situated on a peninsula, with a harbor on its front and on its\r\nrear. This peninsula is all laid out in streets, which cross one\r\nanother at right angles, with perfect regularity. At the point where\r\nthe peninsula terminates, is a spacious place, intended to serve as a\r\npromenade; and here there is a narrow shoal running off to another piece\r\nof land, which is a peninsula or an island by turns, as the shoal is\r\ncovered or uncovered by the water.\r\n\r\nThere is a wonderful quaintness and quiet in Chester. It is the Nova\r\nScotian representative of Sleepy Hollow. The streets, which are so\r\nnicely laid out, are all covered with turf, and are as green as the town\r\nlots on either side. The houses are all old; the people are all quiet\r\nand leisurely, taking the world in the easiest manner possible. The very\r\ndogs, affected by the peace and calm around, seem unwilling to bark,\r\nexcept under the strongest possible provocation.\r\n\r\nThe scenery around this quaint little town may safely be classed among\r\nthe most beautiful in the world. The wide bay, with its hundreds of\r\nislands, forms an almost unequalled place for yachting. Many of the\r\nislands have curious names, associated with some curious legend.\r\nThe waters abound with myriads of shell fish, and sometimes have a\r\nmarvellous transparency. The winding shore of the bay forms one of the\r\nloveliest of drives, and affords perpetual variety of scenery; and the\r\nclimate in summer time is so genial, that it forms the perfection of\r\na watering-place for those who have to fly from the heat of southern\r\nlatitudes. And this will one day be the destiny of Chester, when the\r\nworld knows it; when the rush of parched travellers takes place; when\r\ngreat hotels face its promenade, and the streets, once laid out with so\r\nbold a design, are lined with houses and shops. Such changes will one\r\nday take place; but whether Chester will be then so altogether lovely as\r\nit is now in its Sleepy Hollow epoch, is a matter about which there may\r\nwell be doubt.\r\n\r\nSuch was the place, then, in which the boys found themselves; and they\r\nall agreed with one opinion, that Chester was, in every respect, worthy\r\nof standing here in this lovely bay, in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nmysterious Island of the Buccaneers, where lay stored up the treasure of\r\nthe sea and the plunder of the Spanish Main.\r\n\r\nOn looking about the place, they came to an inn, which had such an air\r\nof comfort and tranquillity, and such a home-like appearance, that they\r\ndetermined to put up at it, and prosecute their investigations in a\r\nleisurely fashion. They arrived in time for dinner; and, if there had\r\nbeen any doubt in their minds as to the propriety of deserting the\r\nAntelope, it was dispelled at the appearance of the dinner which was\r\nserved up. For there were salmon and green peas,--delicacies of which,\r\nlike all good boys, they were particularly fond, and to which they had\r\nbeen strangers for a long time. There, too, were strawberries, the last\r\nof the season, with cream of the richest kind; and together with these\r\nwere the mealiest of potatoes, the whitest of bread, the freshest of\r\nbutter, and the most immaculate coffee. To all these things their late\r\nsea fare afforded a striking contrast, and Solomon’s star declined\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\nThe landlord they found most good-natured, and most genial, like all the\r\ninhabitants of this favored spot. He was communicative about himself,\r\nproud of his town, proud of the scenery around, and yet not at all\r\ninquisitive as to the purposes of his guests. This seemed to them to\r\nbe the very man whom they might interrogate without endangering\r\ntheir secret; for, while his communicativeness would lead him to tell\r\neverything that there was to be told, his lack of curiosity would\r\nprevent him from asking any unpleasant questions.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as soon as they could get a convenient chance, they\r\nbutton-holed the landlord, and began a series of questions of a very\r\nnon-committal character, referring chiefly to the scenery of Mahone Bay,\r\nand the places most worthy of a visit. They did not make the remotest\r\nreference to the buccaneers or to Captain Kidd, but seemed to have their\r\nthoughts occupied with scenery only.\r\n\r\nThe landlord grew eloquent upon the theme of the scenery of Mahone\r\nBay. He told them about the islands, and mentioned the number very\r\nparticularly, insisting upon it that their number was exactly three\r\nhundred and sixty-five. He spoke of the drive along the shore, of a\r\nplace called Gold River, where there was excellent fishing, and finally\r\nmentioned a place which he called Aspot-ogon. Upon this theme he\r\ngrew more enthusiastic than ever. Aspotogon, he said, was the highest\r\nmountain on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, and the approach to it\r\nafforded a view of the most remarkable scenery in the whole bay.\r\nThis approach lay through a narrow inlet which ran to the base of the\r\nmountain, and was called Deep Cove. It was bordered by precipices, for\r\na long way, on either side, and was a wild and romantic spot. It\r\nterminated in a circular basin, on one side of which was a deep\r\ndeclivity, by which they could find the shortest ascent to the summit of\r\nAspotogon; and, in addition to this, they could find fishing and bathing\r\nto their hearts’ content.\r\n\r\nIn all this, however, there was no mention made of any island like\r\nthe one which they wished to find. He mentioned, indeed, the names of\r\nseveral islands, in a casual sort of way, but made no allusion to any\r\nlegends of the buccaneers. The only reference which he made to treasure,\r\nwas on the name of that fishing stream which he had described to them.\r\nThis was Gold River; and the name excited their attention. Bart asked\r\nwhat the name had reference to; and the landlord replied, that it arose\r\nfrom the color of its water. This commonplace derivation of such a\r\nname disgusted and disappointed them all, for they hoped to hear of a\r\ndifferent origin, and one more in accordance with their present purpose.\r\n\r\nThe landlord dwelt to a great extent on Aspotogon and Deep Cove, and\r\nfinally offered to go there with them, if they felt inclined to make a\r\nvisit to the place. Though the boys were still as eager as ever about\r\nthe Island of the Buccaneers, yet they were by no means indifferent to\r\nthe charms of a romantic place like this, nor at all disinclined to roam\r\nabout the bay farther. The offer of the landlord was also an additional\r\ninducement, and they thought that in the intimacy of shipboard they\r\nmight manage to get something more direct out of him, and learn from him\r\nall that there was to be learnt about any existing legends current among\r\nthe people, such as the governor of Sable Island had mentioned. It was\r\narranged, therefore, that they should go on the following day.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the boys started off in different directions. Bruce in a\r\nboat, Arthur along the shore, Tom and Phil over the hills, while Bart\r\nand Pat sauntered about the wharves, catching star-fish, sea-urchins,\r\nand jelly-fish, of which there were myriads. Towards evening they\r\nreturned to the inn, and found the landlord seated on the steps. They\r\nseated themselves too, and gradually fell into a conversation.\r\n\r\n“This bay must have been a great place in old times,” said Bart,\r\ntrying to feel his way as easily as possible towards the subject of the\r\nbuccaneers.\r\n\r\nThe landlord shook his head with solemn emphasis.\r\n\r\n“Tre--mendous!” he slowly ejaculated.\r\n\r\n“Such a capital place for hiding from any ship that might be chasing!”\r\n said Bart; “so many islands! Why, if a ship once got in here, she could\r\nnever be found.”\r\n\r\n“Best dodging-place in the world,” said the landlord. “Lots of islands,\r\nlots of harbors, and deep water too, everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“The old French day’s must have been pretty exciting hereabouts,”\r\n continued Bart, making a fresh advance. “The English and French used\r\nto have it hot and heavy; and I dare say this bay had its share of the\r\nfun.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course,” said the landlord; “and before that too, long\r\nbefore; and worse goings on than fair, stand-up fights. There’s been\r\nqueer doings in these waters.”\r\n\r\nTo these words the landlord gave emphasis by a significant shake of his\r\nhead, which spoke unutterable things, and drove Bart and Pat wild with\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\nThe landlord looked at him solemnly for a few moments, and then asked,--\r\n\r\n“Did you ever happen to hear of Captain Kidd?”\r\n\r\n“Captain Kidd?” repeated Bart, in innocent wonder, “Captain Kidd? Hear\r\nof him? Of course I’ve heard of him. Everybody knows about him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if that man’s ghost don’t haunt this bay, then I’m a nigger.”\r\n\r\n“Haunt this bay? What do you mean? What had Captain Kidd to do with this\r\nbay? He was hanged at London.”\r\n\r\n“He had a precious lot to do with this bay,” said the landlord,\r\npositively.\r\n\r\n“Why, I don’t see how that could be,” said Bart, trying to get the\r\nlandlord excited by contradiction. “I don’t see how he ever could have\r\nbeen here. His story’s a simple enough one; soon told. I’ve heard it\r\noften. How he went from New York to London well recommended, and got\r\na commission from the British government to command a ship, for the\r\npurpose of putting down pirates in India and the East. But this didn’t\r\nsuit him quite; so he turned pirate himself. Most of his piracies took\r\nplace in the East, though. It’s true he returned to America, and made a\r\ngreat panic; but he was captured and sent to England, where he was tried\r\nand executed. That was in 1699. I remember the date very well. So I\r\ndon’t see how he could have done much about here.”\r\n\r\nBart spoke very volubly, and seemed to have the Life of Captain Kidd\r\nat his tongue’s end. The landlord listened very attentively. But Bart’s\r\nwords, instead of shaking his own convictions, only served, as Bart had\r\nhoped and intended, to strengthen and confirm them. As Bart spoke, he\r\nraised himself up out of the lounging attitude in which he had been\r\nsitting, looked full in Bart’s face, and as he ceased,--\r\n\r\n“Very well. Grant all that,” said the landlord, with a comprehensive\r\nsweep of his hand, which seemed to concede every single statement\r\nthat Bart had made, in the fullest and frankest manner.\r\n“Grant--all--that--every word of it. I don’t doubt it at all--not\r\nme. Very well. Now mark me. Captain Kidd did really, and truly, and\r\nactually, flourish about here, in this here bay--for he’s left behind\r\nhim the most--un--mis--tak--able in--di--ca--tions. I’ve seen ’em\r\nmyself, with my own eyes. I’ve handled ‘em myself, and with my own\r\nhands. And besides, that there pirate must have been about over the\r\ncoast of America a good deal more than you give him credit for, or he\r\nwouldn’t have left a name behind, from one end of America to the other;\r\nand, at any rate, he must have been here, or else he wouldn’t have left\r\nbehind what he has left, and what I’ve seen with my own eyes.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know,” said Bart, “that he had left any traces of himself\r\nhere. What are they? What kind of traces?”\r\n\r\n“What kind of traces?” said the landlord. “Traces that beat everything\r\nin the way of traces that any pirate ever made. What do you say, for\r\ninstance, to a pit so deep that nobody’s ever been able to get to the\r\nbottom of it?”\r\n\r\n“A pit? What sort of a pit?” asked Bart, full of excitement.\r\n\r\n“What do you say to his filling that pit with oaken chests, crammed\r\nfull of gold and silver ingots, and gold candlesticks, plundered from\r\nCatholic churches, and precious stones, such as diamonds, rubies, and\r\nemeralds--beyond all counting?”\r\n\r\n“Gold! silver! precious stones!” repeated Bart, who was so overcome by\r\nthis astounding information, that he could only utter these words.\r\n\r\n“What do you say to his taking the prisoners that had dug his hole, and\r\nfilled it, and killing them all, to keep his secret?”\r\n\r\n“Killing his prisoners!”\r\n\r\n“What do you say,” continued the landlord, enjoying with keenest relish\r\nthe evident excitement of Bart,--“what do you say to his contriving the\r\nmost extraordinary plans ever heard of to prevent anybody ever getting\r\nat that treasure,--by making the hole, in the first place, far down\r\nunder the level of the sea,--by building a drain, so as to let in the\r\nsea water; and then, after killing the prisoners, filling up the hole to\r\nthe very top? What do you say to all that?”.\r\n\r\n“Why, I never heard of this in all my life! How do you know it? Tell me,\r\nnow. Tell me all about it. Where is the place? Is it here--in this bay?”\r\n\r\n“Of course it is. I’ve said as much,” replied the landlord.\r\n\r\n“But you didn’t mention it this morning.”\r\n\r\n“No, because you only wanted to hear about fine scenery. This place\r\nisn’t particularly remarkable for that. It’s a little island, not more\r\nthan three miles from here, up that way to the right. It’s called Oak\r\nIsland, because Captain Kidd planted it with acorns, so as to know it\r\nwhen he came back. Well, since his day, the acorns have grown to be\r\noaks--some of them pretty big--though being near the sea, they haven’t\r\ngrown so big as they would have done if they had been planted farther\r\ninland.”\r\n\r\n“Oak Island!” repeated Bart, in a tone which expressed the most profound\r\ninterest,--“Oak Island!”\r\n\r\n“That’s the place,” said the landlord. “I wonder you ain’t heard of Oak\r\nIsland before.”\r\n\r\n“Never,” said Bart; “that is, I’ve heard the name mentioned; but never\r\nknew that Captain Kidd had anything to do with it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what he had,” said the landlord. “Everybody in these\r\nparts can tell you all about it. People have been full of it ever since\r\nChester was settled. I’ve heard it all my life.”\r\n\r\n“But if there’s money there, why don’t they get it?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“Because they can’t!”\r\n\r\n“Can’t?”\r\n\r\n“No, can’t. Captain Kidd knowed what he was about, and he made his\r\narrangements so that, from that day to this, nobody’s ever been able to\r\nget down to the bottom of that money-hole, and, in my humble opinion,\r\nnever will.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the landlord, “it’s a long story; but as I’ve got nothing\r\nto do just now, I don’t mind telling you about it.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the landlord settled himself into an easy, lounging attitude,\r\nand began the story of Oak Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n_The wonderful Story of Oak Island.--The Circle in the Forest.--Digging\r\nfor Gold.--Exciting Discoveries.--Far down in the Depths of the\r\nEarth.--The Treasure touched at last.--The Treasure snatched away.--A\r\nnew Search, and its Results.--Boring through the Chest of Gold.--A\r\nCompany.--A new Pit made.--The Drain.--New Efforts.--The Coffer\r\nDam.--New Companies.--Captain Kidd too much for them._\r\n\r\n\r\nI BELIEVE.” said the landlord, “there’s always been a talk, among\r\nthe people around here, that Captain Kidd used this place as a kind\r\nof headquarters; and this idea seems to me to have come down from\r\nold settlers who might have been here in his own day,--French and\r\nothers,--though Chester wasn’t actually settled till long after his\r\ntime. At any rate, there it was, and everybody used always to believe\r\nthat Captain Kidd hid his money somewhere in this bay. Well, nothing\r\nvery particular happened till some sixty years ago, when a man, on\r\nvisiting Oak Island, just by chance saw something which seemed to him\r\nvery curious.\r\n\r\n“The island was overgrown with oaks and other trees intermixed. Now,\r\nright in the midst of these trees, he came to a queer-looking place. It\r\nwas circular, and about fifteen feet in diameter. Trees grew all around\r\nit. Just on this circular spot, however, nothing grew at all, not even\r\nmoss or ferns. It looked as if it had been cursed, or blasted. The\r\ntrees were all around it--some oak and some maple; but among them was\r\none,--pine or spruce, I don’t know which,--and this one looked a good\r\ndeal older than the others. One of the boughs of this old pine tree\r\nprojected right over the blasted circular spot in a very singular\r\nfashion, and on this the man noticed something that looked like very\r\nqueer growth for a pine tree. He climbed up, and found that it was a\r\npulley, which was so rotten that it might have been hanging there a\r\nhundred years. It was fastened to the bough by a chain, and this was so\r\nrusty that it broke in his hands. This pulley and rusty chain the man\r\nremoved and took with him.\r\n\r\n“Of course, as you may imagine, he was a good deal struck by the\r\nappearance of things. He had always heard that Captain Kidd had once\r\nfrequented Mahone Bay, and had buried treasure somewhere about; and here\r\nhe had discovered this blasted spot with a pulley over it, in the very\r\nmidst of the woods on a lonely island--a place that looked as though no\r\none had ever been there but himself since that pulley was last used. Of\r\ncourse he asked himself what the meaning of all this was; and to him\r\nit seemed most likely that the circular space marked some pit in the\r\nground, and that the pulley had been used to lower things down into this\r\npit.\r\n\r\n“Well, he went home, and didn’t say anything about it to a living soul,\r\nexcept his son, a young man, whom he wanted to help him. He determined\r\nto examine deeper, and after talking it over with his son, he was\r\nmore determined than ever. So the very next day they began their\r\npreparations, taking over picks, and spades, and ropes, and provisions,\r\nand everything that could be needed for their purpose.\r\n\r\n“They went to work and dug away for a little distance, when they came\r\nto something hard. It was a stone hewn,--not very smooth,--a kind of\r\nsandstone, and on this they saw some marks that looked like strange\r\nletters. They were ignorant men, but they knew the alphabet, and they\r\nknew that this was no kind of English letters at all; but it seemed to\r\nthem that they might be letters of some strange alphabet. They took this\r\nstone away, and it’s been preserved ever since, and it’s there yet on\r\nthe island, built into the wall of a cottage there for safe keeping.\r\nI’ve seen it myself dozens of times. That’s what I mean when I say I’ve\r\nseen the traces of Captain Kidd, for it’s my solemn conviction that he\r\ncut that inscription on the stone in some foreign letters, or perhaps in\r\nsome secret cipher.\r\n\r\n“After taking out that stone, they went on digging harder than ever, and\r\nabout two feet down they came to a sort of wooden flooring. The wood was\r\nin good preservation, and consisted of large logs, a dozen feet long,\r\nlaid across side by side, and rough-hewed about six inches square. They\r\nthought that they had come to the money-hole now, for sure, and pulled\r\nup the logs quick enough, you’d better believe; but they didn’t know\r\nwhat was before them. After taking up the beams, they found they had to\r\ndig deeper; and so they went on digging away deeper and deeper. It took\r\na long time, for they had to stay up the earth as they dug down, to\r\nprevent it from falling in, and they soon found that the job was a\r\nbigger one than they had bargained for; but what they had already found\r\nexcited them, and cheered them on day after day.\r\n\r\n“Of course they couldn’t do this all in one day. One day’s work couldn’t\r\ntake them far into that hole, though they worked like beavers. Well,\r\nthey dug on this way, and at last, about five or six feet farther\r\ndown,--some say ten; but it don’t make any difference,--they found\r\nanother flooring just like the first, only the logs were smaller. These\r\nthey took up, and then went on digging as before, day after day. They\r\nnow found bits of things that looked favorable; they found cocoa husks,\r\nand West India grass, and bits of cane, all of which showed that the\r\npeople who worked here must have had something to do with the West\r\nIndies and the Spanish Main. These things never grew in Nova Scotia.\r\nThey had been brought here by the men that made the hole, and had got\r\nmixed up with the earth that they shovelled in. They also found shavings\r\nor chips made with tools. Well, about the same distance down that the\r\nsecond flooring had been from the first, they found a third flooring,\r\nwhich was just like the second.\r\n\r\n“At this third flooring there was a fresh disappointment, just as\r\nthere had been at the other two; but the very fact that there was this\r\nflooring encouraged them to go on, and so they continued to dig. After\r\na time they came to another flooring, and continuing on, they came\r\nto another, and yet another; and at every place they had the same\r\ndisappointment and encouragement. All the way they found the same signs,\r\nthat the soil had once been turned up by people who had dealings with\r\nthe Spanish Main, for the cocoa-nut husks and the West India grasses\r\nwere mixed with the soil all the way. All the time they had to keep\r\nstaying up the sides, and the deeper they went, the more careful they\r\nhad to be, for the soil seemed loose and dangerous just here.\r\n\r\n“Well, they worked this way for about three months, and at last had got\r\never so far down--I have heard some say that they got down as much as\r\na hundred feet, and that would be about seventy feet below the level\r\nof the sea at low tide, for the island is only a small one, and doesn’t\r\nrise more than twenty-five feet at the highest point. All the way down\r\nthey had found the signs continuing, showing that diggers had been here\r\nbefore, and that the soil had been turned up. This it was that led them\r\non to such a depth.\r\n\r\n“Well, now it was down at this depth that they touched the treasure. It\r\nwas evening, and quite dark down there. They had been digging all\r\nday, and were about to just knock off. The son, before going, took his\r\ncrowbar, and drove it with all his might into the ground. It was soft,\r\nloose, and gravelly just here, and the iron sank for about a foot into\r\nthe soil, and struck something hard. Their attention was attracted by\r\nthis at once, and they tried it again and again. Each time it struck\r\nsomething hard. It seemed like wood. At one or two places it seemed like\r\nmetal. They tried this a good many times, until at length they became\r\nconvinced that this was a wooden box with iron hoops or fastenings, and\r\nthat this box contained the treasure for which they were searching. But\r\nby this time it was too late to do any more. To get at that chest would\r\nrequire a good day’s work. To hoist it up would not be possible. They\r\nsaw that they would have to break or cut into it as it lay, and empty it\r\nof its contents. They were also worn out with their long day’s work,\r\nand in addition to this, they did not feel comfortable down in that\r\nparticular place after dark. So, for all these reasons, they concluded\r\nto postpone the completion of their work till the following day. After\r\nall, there was no reason why they shouldn’t. No one could come and\r\ntake it. It would be there unmoved till they might want to remove it\r\nthemselves. And so the long and the short of it is, they went up, and\r\nwent off to sleep in the hut where they lived.\r\n\r\n“That night they slept soundly, and waked a little later than usual on\r\nthe following day. They at once rushed to the money-hole; they did this\r\nthe moment they waked, without waiting for breakfast, or taking anything\r\nto eat. They both felt anxious, for everything was at stake, and the\r\nsleep of both, though sound, had been marked by unpleasant and harassing\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\n“Well, they reached the place, and there an awful sight met them--a\r\nsight that meant ruination to their hopes, and to all the hard work that\r\nthey’d put forth in that place. The hole was gone; the earth had all\r\nfallen in; the stays had all given way: and there was nothing there now\r\nbut a basin-shaped hollow, and bits of board projecting. What was worse,\r\nit was all mixed with water, and so soft, that in attempting to walk\r\ninto it, they sank up to their knees in the mud. And that was the end of\r\nthis first digging after Kidd’s treasure; for though they tried to dig\r\nagain, they found it impossible on account of the water. It seemed to\r\ncome straight from the sea, and they couldn’t do anything at all. So\r\nthey had to give up at last, and go home.\r\n\r\n“Now, some people think that the staying wasn’t strong enough, and the\r\nsides caved in on that account; others, again, talk about Kidd’s ghost\r\nbaffling these diggers; but, from what was discovered afterwards, I feel\r\nperfectly sure that they themselves somehow let in the water of the sea\r\ninto the hole by a drain or channel underground that Kidd himself had\r\nmade. I think those knocks on the chest with the crowbar loosened some\r\nstopper, and the water poured in at once. It was this rush of sea water\r\nthat destroyed everything, and made the hole cave in altogether. As to\r\nthe drain, that was a contrivance of Kidd’s to prevent the treasure from\r\nbeing dug up by outsiders. He had it made underground from the shore\r\nof the island at low-water mark to the bottom of the money-hole. He\r\nhimself, or any one in the secret, would know how to dig and get the\r\ntreasure; but any one who didn’t know the secret would be sure to do\r\nsomething that would let in the sea water. And that’s just what these\r\nfirst diggers did.\r\n\r\n“Well, after this nothing was done for a long time. These two, father\r\nand son, went home, and for a while they kept the whole business a\r\nsecret; but after some years the old man died, and the son married,\r\nand so the whole story leaked out, till everybody knew all about it.\r\nEverybody went then to see the place, and the story soon got to be as\r\nwell known as the alphabet all over the bay; and I won’t swear but that\r\nsome additions were made to the story as it passed from mouth to mouth,\r\nfor that would only be natural, after all; but at any rate, that story\r\nlived, and people didn’t forget the treasure on Oak Island. And so time\r\npassed, and the son died at last, and the grandson grew up, and this one\r\nthought that he would make a dash at the treasure. This was as much as\r\nforty years after the first digging. He went with a few friends, and\r\nthey tried to dig, but couldn’t. The money-hole remained as it had been\r\nleft by the first diggers,--all sand, and gravel, and water,--more like\r\na quicksand than anything else. They put a pump in it, and set it to\r\nwork, but couldn’t do anything that way. So they gave it up.\r\n\r\n“Well, these operations got known everywhere, and the whole story came\r\nup again. A lot of men formed themselves into a company, the grandson\r\nwas one of them. They bought the island, and resolved to go to work on\r\na grand scale. They rigged a pump which was worked by a horse in a very\r\npeculiar fashion, and had a hoisting apparatus worked by another horse\r\nto lift up the dirt. They got a lot of wood on the place for stayings\r\nto the hole, and went to work. Before they began, they bored down for\r\na hundred and twenty feet. On taking out the auger, they saw on the\r\nlowest part scraps of wood, then bright scrapings that looked like gold,\r\nthen wood again. And this showed that the auger had gone clean through\r\nthe chest, and had brought back signs of the chest itself, and of the\r\ntreasure inside. This created the greatest excitement, and the company\r\nwent to work as eagerly and as industriously as the original diggers.\r\nWell, they kept at it, and dug, and hoisted, and pumped for a whole\r\nsummer; but it was no go. As fast as they pumped, the water poured in,\r\nand faster too; and in fact, they couldn’t make the slightest impression\r\non the water in the money-hole, do what they would. So they gave up.\r\n\r\n“Well, after this, another company started. The new company bought out\r\nfrom the old all its rights, and started on a new plan. Many of the old\r\ncompany belonged to the new one, and these had learned by experience the\r\nimpossibility of doing anything by digging in the money-hole itself. The\r\nnew plan consisted in digging a new hole altogether. In the operations\r\nof the old company they had discovered that though the money-hole was\r\nall sand and gravel, yet all around it the soil was a hard blue clay,\r\nquite impervious to water, and very easy to work in. They thought by\r\ndigging alongside the money-hole, as near as the clay would allow, they\r\nmight go down to the same depth, and then tunnel along at the bottom\r\ntill they reached the treasure chest. So they went to work about thirty\r\nfeet away from the money-hole, digging in the clay. They had no trouble\r\nin digging. The soil was free from stones, firm clay, impervious to\r\nwater, and they made first-rate progress to a certain extent. They\r\ngot down about a hundred feet, and then ventured to tunnel towards the\r\nmoney-hole. They worked very carefully, for it was rather dangerous, as\r\nthey were under the level of the sea, and were therefore exposed to a\r\nrush of water at any false movement that they might make. But in spite\r\nof all their care, they failed at last; for one day they went up to\r\ndinner, and on going back again, they found the new hole filled\r\nwith water to within thirty feet or so of the top. It was a sore\r\ndisappointment, and they could only console themselves by the thought\r\nthat they had been so fortunate as to have left the hole at that\r\nparticular time. They tried to pump out the water, and made some faint\r\nefforts to continue their work, but it was no use. The failure had been\r\ntoo great, and this attempt broke down.\r\n\r\n“Well, they now concluded that there was a drain, the same one I spoke of\r\na while ago,--reaching from the shore of the island at low-water mark,\r\nor beneath it, down to the bottom of the money-hole, and that they had\r\nsomehow broken into this drain, the waters of which had poured into the\r\nnew hole, and flooded it. This discovery created fresh excitement: and\r\nas this company gave up, a new one was formed, which bought out all\r\nprevious rights, and on the following summer proceeded to make a fresh\r\nattempt. Each one of these companies which had been bought out still\r\nretained, however, a claim on the profits that might be made; sometimes\r\ntwenty per cent, and sometimes ten per cent, of the treasure. The new\r\ncompany, even if it had succeeded, could only have received about\r\none fifth, or perhaps one fourth, of the treasure, the rest being all\r\nforfeited, or mortgaged, so to speak, to the old companies. Still the\r\nnew company had many members who belonged to the old companies, and\r\nwho still stuck to the enterprise through thick and thin, so that their\r\nundertaking, under such circumstances, is not so surprising, after all.\r\n\r\n“This new company, using the experience and discoveries of the preceding\r\nones, went on a new principle. The idea now was, that, first of all, the\r\ndrain should be discovered, and the supply of water intercepted. If\r\nthis were done, they would be able to get to the bottom of the original\r\nmoney-hole itself without any trouble. So they set to work, and explored\r\nthe whole shore of the island. They found one place where at low tide\r\nthere was a great bubbling in the water, and this they took for the\r\nplace where the drain began. Here they built a coffer dam, and then\r\ntried to find the drain itself. On the shore they met with no success;\r\nso they dug pits at intervals along a line stretching from the coffer\r\ndam to the money-hole. The soil in all these places consisted of that\r\nsame tenacious blue clay which I have already mentioned. I don’t know\r\nhow many of these were dug, but there were several, at any rate. Now,\r\nwhenever they attempted to strike the drain, the water was invariably\r\ntoo much for them, and rushed in, giving them nothing to do but to fly\r\nas fast as they could. In other places they were afraid to venture\r\ntoo near the drain. The end of it was, that this last company was as\r\nunsuccessful as the others, though it had spent ten times as much as any\r\nof them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n_The Toilers of the Sea.--New Efforts to find the Plunder of the\r\nSpanish Main.--Modern Science versus Captain Kidd.--The Landlord’s\r\nFaith.--Scoffers and Mockers at the Money-hole.--Objections\r\nconsidered.--The Timber Floorings.--The Stone, with its mysterious\r\nInscription.--The Gravel pit, with its Surroundings of blue Clay.--The\r\nDrain from the Sea to the Money-hole._\r\n\r\n\r\nSO, you see,” said the landlord, “how all these efforts to get at the\r\ntreasure have failed; and it is not difficult to see the reason, either.\r\nFor, you see, as I have already said, the money-hole has been all filled\r\nin with sand and gravel, and there is a drain, or channel, connecting\r\nwith the sea, which lets in the sea water; so, the moment any one\r\nundertakes to touch the money-hole, he has to contend with the sea\r\nitself, and there hasn’t, thus far, been force enough put forth there to\r\ndo that. The money-hole is something peculiar. All around it the soil is\r\nthis blue clay. No doubt the soil where this was first dug was blue\r\nclay also; but, after burying the treasure, Kidd, for his own crafty\r\npurposes, filled it up with this gravel. No doubt his idea was, that the\r\nsea water should affect it the more thoroughly, and make it like a great\r\nquicksand. The pumps they set up there did no more good than if they\r\nwere so many toys.\r\n\r\n“Well, the failure of the last company has been followed by a\r\npause, partly on account of discouragement, but still more from the\r\ndetermination, on the part of a few, to begin again on a grand scale; on\r\na scale, indeed, so grand, that it will take some time to make all the\r\npreparations. Some of the leaders in the previous undertakings are at\r\nthe head of this new movement, and have already done very much towards\r\nputting it into life and action. This new plan is to get up a regular\r\njoint stock company, with a thousand shares, each worth a hundred\r\ndollars, or thereabouts. It will be a regular company; the shares will\r\nbe sold in the market, and the stockholdors will stand in the same\r\nrelation to this business as they would to a coal mine, or any other\r\nordinary undertaking. They’ll have a president, a board of directors,\r\nand a superintendent of the mining works. It is proposed to employ a\r\nregular engineer to survey the ground, and design the best mode of going\r\nto work; to put up a steam engine of sufficient power to pump out the\r\nmoney-hole, and keep a large force of men at work, night and day, in\r\nseparate detachments. The idea is, to do it up as fast as possible, and\r\nget at it once for all, or fail utterly.\r\n\r\n“Now, this company is already started, and about a quarter of the stock\r\nhas been taken up. I shouldn’t be surprised to see them set to work next\r\nyear, or the year after, at the farthest. The thing is bound to go on.\r\nBesides those who believe that the treasure is here, there are ever\r\nso many who wish to see the mystery cleared op, irrespective of any\r\ntreasure. These men are going into the new company almost as extensively\r\nas those who believe in the money. Then, again, there are ever so many\r\npeople about the country who have heard about it for the first time,\r\nand are taking shares just as they would buy tickets in a lottery; not\r\nbecause they expect to make anything, exactly, but because they are\r\nwilling to run the risk, and take their chance.\r\n\r\n“This sort of thing, of course, has a far different prospect from what\r\nthe old companies had. It puts the whole plan on a different footing.\r\nIt makes it, in fact, a thoroughly legitimate business, and sets on\r\nas sound a basis as if it was an iron or coal mining company. A real,\r\npractical engineer--a man who is a practical geologist also--could tell\r\nmore about Oak Island in one walk round it, than the other workers\r\nfound out in years. He could find out the real place where the sea water\r\nenters; whether there is one only, or more than one. When once that is\r\nfound out, and stopped, the rest is easy. But, if they can’t stop\r\nit, why, then, let the steam pump go to work, and I don’t think the\r\nmoney-hole would be flooded much longer. Then, again, the plan of\r\nhaving two gangs to work night and day, so as to have no stoppage in\r\nthe operations, will be a most important thing. And so, what with modern\r\nscience, and steam, and continuous work of large gangs, oven old Kidd\r\nhimself ’ll find his match.\r\n\r\n“The fact is the gold is there--the treasure of Captain Kidd--brought\r\nhere by him, and buried in that hole. I no more doubt that than I doubt\r\nmy own existence. If that hole had never been touched, and people went\r\nto work now at the fresh ground, I believe the treasure would be got\r\nat. Why, the first diggers almost got it, though there were only two\r\nof them. The gold is there--there’s not the slightest doubt of that--a\r\ntreasure beyond all estimate--worth millions on millions, no doubt--gold\r\nand silver ingots--the plunder of Spanish cathedrals and Spanish\r\ngalleons--diamonds and rubies--and all that. Millions? Why, it’s equal\r\nin value to the revenue of a great nation. There it is; and all it wants\r\nis for people to go to work in the right way; not in a pettifogging,\r\nmean, peddling fashion, but in a large-handed, bold, vigorous way.\r\nThat’s the thing that ’ll fetch up the plunder of the Spanish Main!\r\nI’ve sometimes heard people say that there was once a great confederacy\r\nof pirates that made this buy their headquarters, and that Captain Kidd\r\nwas the last and greatest of the brotherhood. Until his time the plunder\r\nhad been kept in a safe place, but in a place where it could be got at;\r\nbut that he, being the last of the brotherhood, determined to fix up\r\nsome safer place, and so he arranged this place--the hole and the drain;\r\nand if that’s so, we have here not merely the plunder of Captain\r\nKidd himself, but of all the pirates, for no one knows how long a\r\ntime--centuries, I dare say.”\r\n\r\nTo all this extraordinary story the boys had listened with the deepest\r\nattention. The landlord’s announcement of his own belief in it was to\r\nthem very impressive, and his extravagant conclusion did not seem at all\r\nextravagant to them. It jibed perfectly with what they had heard from\r\nthe governor of Sable Island. They were most profoundly impressed,\r\nand the treasure island seemed to them more attractive than ever. The\r\nlandlord’s mind seemed to be filled with a vision of inconceivable\r\ntreasure, and by long familiarity with the thought, it seemed quite\r\nnatural to him to speak so glibly about gold, and silver, and precious\r\nstones, and all the rest that went to make up the plunder of the Spanish\r\nMain.\r\n\r\nBart and Pat were not critical; none of the boys were. This remark has\r\nalready been made in connection with the story of the governor of Sable\r\nInland. Had they been critical, they could have picked various holes\r\nin this narrative, and asked questions to which it would have been\r\ndifficult for the landlord, or any other believer in Kidd’s treasure,\r\nto give any sufficient answer. They might have asked how it was that\r\nthe tradition about the early diggers had been so minute, and why it\r\nwas that no competent scholar or archeologist had been found who might\r\ndecipher the inscription on the stone. They might have asked how it was\r\nthat the so-called “drain” had been discovered, and also how it was that\r\nKidd’s so-called “place” was known so accurately. But they were not at\r\nall critically inclined, and the questions which they did ask were of a\r\ntotally different kind.\r\n\r\nThey did ask questions, of course; and the questions referred to the\r\nchief points in the landlord’s story. They had much to ask about the\r\nfirst discovery, the size of the island, the appearance of the blasted\r\ncircular spot, of the tree and the projecting bough; about the pulley\r\nand its chain; about the log floorings, their number, their distance\r\napart, and their probable use in a money-hole; about the West Indian\r\ngrass, the cocoa-nut husks, and the sugar-cane, which were the signs of\r\nsome connection with the Spanish Main; about the shavings and chips of\r\nwood; about the gravelly soil, contrasting with the blue clay around it;\r\nabout the eventful moment when the first diggers touched the money-box\r\nwith the crowbar, and the destruction of their work during the night.\r\nThey asked also, very minutely, about the stone with the inscription,\r\nits kind and its size, and why it should have been inserted into the\r\nchimney of a hut; about the drain, its size, and whether it was built of\r\nwood, or brick, or stone; and about the nature of the signs brought up\r\nby the anger when they bored through the money-box.\r\n\r\nAll these questions showed how close had been the attention with\r\nwhich they had listened. To every one of them, without exception, the\r\nland-lord responded in the most unhesitating and the most comprehensive\r\nmanner. It was evident that he had turned over every point in his mind\r\nthat they now suggested; that he was familiar with every objection, and\r\nwas armed and equipped at all points with facts and arguments to sustain\r\nhis theory.\r\n\r\nThat there were plenty of objections to that theory became evident from\r\nthe landlord’s own very frequent allusions to them, and it seemed, by\r\nthe way in which he spoke of them, as though he himself had often and\r\noften done battle with scornful or sceptical opponents.\r\n\r\n“For my own part,” said the landlord, “I don’t think much of any of\r\nthese objections. Objections are easy enough to make. You can make them\r\nto anything you like--or don’t like. The truest things in the world meet\r\nwith lots of unbelievers, who offer objections. Now, I know this whole\r\nstory to be true, and I don’t value the objections a rush.\r\n\r\n“Ono objection, for instance, is, that the story of the first diggers\r\nhad been exaggerated in every particular. In passing from mouth to\r\nmouth, they say, each one has added to it, and that all the little\r\ncircumstances that I have mentioned have been either thrown in to make\r\nup a story, or colored so as to favor a belief in the money-hole. Now,\r\nas to that, all I can say is, that the two men always told a straight\r\nstory, without any additions, and the younger one lived down to my time,\r\nand so could easily be referred to by any ono. He always made the same\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n“A great objection is, that two men could never have dug down so far,\r\nand stayed up the sides of the pit, as the story said they did. It\r\nhas been asserted that they couldn’t have dug down more than twenty or\r\nthirty feet, and that they probably got down that far when they came\r\nto the water, which prevented them from going any farther. To which I\r\nanswer, not only that two men could have dug a hundred feet, but that\r\nthey have done so, over and over, on the same ground, for in the holes\r\nmade since, it isn’t possible for more than two to work at the same\r\ntime. The shafts are only about six feet long by three wide, and in that\r\nspace there isn’t room for more than two, of course.\r\n\r\n“When I find some who don’t believe in Kidd’s treasure, and ask them what\r\ncould have been there, they make various answers; but the favorite one\r\nis, that it was some sort of a signal-station. But, unfortunately, Oak\r\nInland it the last place about here that one could think of for such a\r\npurpose as that. Still, that is what they urge, and they say that the\r\ntimber floorings were probably intended as a foundation. When I ask them\r\nwhy there were so many timber floorings, they quietly deny the fact They\r\nsay that there might have been one or two such floorings, to the depth\r\nof perhaps ten feet, or so, but won’t believe any more. When I point to\r\nthe testimony of the surviving one of the first diggers, they deny the\r\nvalue of it, and say that it is only the exaggeration of an old man, who\r\nhas been telling the same tall story for years, till it has grown to its\r\npresent dimensions. And when people choose to argue in that style, and\r\nreject the best sort of evidence that there can be, why, of course,\r\nthero’s no end of all discussion. They set out with a blind prejudice,\r\ndeny plain facts, or explain them away in the most fanciful manner, and\r\nthen turn round and ridicule those who believe in what is as plain as\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nThe landlord was silent for a moment, overcome by a kind of mild\r\nindignation at the sceptic of whom he spoke, after which he proceeded.\r\n\r\n“Then there’s that stone with the mysterious inscription. It’s been seen\r\nby hundreds. No one has ever been found yet who can make out what it\r\nmeans. As I said before, it is either some foreign language, or else,\r\nas is quite probable, it is some secret cipher, known only to Kidd\r\nhimself--perhaps used by the great pirate confederacy. It shows, more\r\nthan anything else, that this hole was dug by Captain Kidd, and that his\r\ntreasure is there. Now, how do you suppose they get over that?”\r\n\r\nAnd with this question the landlord looked earnestly and solemnly at the\r\ntwo boys.\r\n\r\nThe two boys couldn’t imagine how anybody could get over it; though Bart\r\ncould not help wondering a little how it came that, if the inscription\r\ncould not be deciphered, the landlord should nevertheless know so well\r\nthat it referred to Captain Kidd.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you,” said the landlord, “the way they get over it. They\r\nhave the impudence to say that it isn’t an inscription at all. Actually,\r\nbecause no one can decipher it, they say it ain’t an inscription.\r\nThey say it’s only some accidental scratches! Now, I allow,” continued\r\nthe landlord, “that the marks are rather faint, and irregular; but how\r\nany man can look at them, and say that they’re not an inscription--how\r\nany man can look at them and say that they’re accidental scratches--is a\r\nthing that makes me fairly dumb with amazement.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then there are other things, too,” continued the landlord, “which\r\nthey handle in the same manner. One of the strangest things about this\r\nwhole story is the fact that the soil in the money-hole is different\r\nfrom that of the rest of the island, being sand and gravel; whereas the\r\nrest of the island, as I told you, is blue clay. It’s just as if a\r\nhole was dug in the blue clay, and then filled in with sand and gravel\r\nbrought from somewhere else. Well, how do you think they got over this?”\r\n\r\nAgain the landlord looked inquiringly at the two buys.\r\n\r\nAgain the two hoys gave it up.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said the landlord, “they get over it in the usual fashion. They\r\nsay it isn’t a fact that the island is blue clay, but that there’s\r\nstreaks and patches of gravel all over it, and the two men hit upon a\r\nplace where the soil was sandy and gravelly. That’s the way they get\r\nover that point; and I’d like to ask any man if that’s fair; if that’s\r\nhonest; if that’s decent. Yet that’s the way they talk--when they can go\r\nto the island, and see wherever fresh boles have been dug, the blue clay\r\nis turned up. But when I point out that, they say, ‘O, that’s because\r\nthe holes are all dug on that one side of the island where the blue clay\r\nis.’\r\n\r\n“Then, again, there’s the drain,” continued the landlord. “Now, if any\r\none thing is an established foot, next to the buried money--it’s Kidd’s\r\ndrain. It’s been broken into time after time. It’s flooded hole after\r\nhole. Yet, in the face of this, they say that there isn’t any drain\r\nat all; that there’s merely some loose soil on the island, or some\r\nsubterranean passage, made by nature, through which the sea water\r\npasses, and that the bottom of the so-called money-hole has been\r\nconnected with this. Some say, that as the island is small, the sea\r\nwater trickles through the soil, in some places, all the way across.\r\nSo, of course, these men, shutting their eyes obstinately to hard facts,\r\nlaugh at the very idea of a drain. And that’s the sort of objections\r\nthat we have to meet!” concluded the landlord, with a snort of contempt.\r\n\r\n“Is any one working on Oak Island now,” asked Bart, after a pause.\r\n\r\n“Well, no, not just now. There isn’t a soul on the island. Since\r\nthe last company gave up, no one has touched the works--except,\r\noccasionally, some visitors. Everything is standing there--the pumps,\r\nthe hoisting tackle, and all that. You’ll see the holes all about; and\r\nthe money-hole can easily be known, for it is a hollow in the ground,\r\nshaped like a bowl, close by the largest pump, with a deep hole beside\r\nit, full of water; for, unfortunately, they struck the drain too soon,\r\nand of course the water rushed upon them.”\r\n\r\nAt this point the landlord recollected some business that he had to\r\nattend to, and rising to his feet, he slowly sauntered away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n_Bart and Pat take a Walk.--A Conversation.--Pat makes a\r\nSuggestion.--Bart adopts it.--A Tunnel to the Treasure of the Sea.--A\r\nPlot kepi secret from the others.--Plans for Aspotogon.--Keeping their\r\nown Council.--Bart and Pat set forth.--Stealing a Boat.--The Search for\r\nthe Treasure Island.--The Intelligent Native.--A new Way of getting at\r\nthe Treasure.--Blood and Thunder!--Once more on the Way.--The Pirates’\r\nIsle!_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE landlord’s story had produced a very profound impression upon the\r\nminds of the boys, and the reiterated emphasis which he placed upon\r\nthe treasure supposed to be buried there did not fail to kindle their\r\nimaginations to a wonderful degree. But together with this excitement,\r\nand astonishment at the magnitude of the supposed treasure, there were\r\nalso other feelings, which latter tended to repel them as much as\r\nthe former tended to attract them. These feelings consisted of\r\ndiscouragement and disappointment, at learning the insuportable\r\ndifficulties that lay in in the way, and at hearing the story of\r\nrepeated failures. Efforts had been made, as they now know, far greater\r\nthan any which were possible to their feeble arms; and in every case\r\nthe money diggers, whether digging in person or by deputy, had failed\r\nutterly and miserably, each one only learning of some new difficulty\r\nwhich necessitated still more arduous toils.\r\n\r\nAs the landlord strolled off, Bart and Pat moved away also up the hill\r\ntowards the back part of the town; and here they sat on a secluded\r\ngrassy slope, looking down into the back bay, whose blue waters lay at\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s a great thing entirely, so it is,” said Pat, “an that’s\r\nall about it.”\r\n\r\n“I hadn’t any idea,” said Bart, “that people knew so much about it I\r\ndidn’t imagine that any body had tried to dig there.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s natural enough for them to do that same, if they thought\r\nthere was money in it.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it was, an that’s the very thing we haven’t been taking into\r\naccount.”\r\n\r\n“Faith, an that same’s true for you, thin; niver a bit did we take it\r\ninto account. Haven’t we been making a wonderful secret of it, when all\r\nthe wurruld knows it like A, B, C.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and what’s worse, at this very moment they are sending out agents\r\nin all directions, all over the province, I dare say, to try to get\r\npeople to take stock in the new mining company. Why, every body must\r\nknow all about Oak Inland. I don’t see how we never heard of it before.”\r\n\r\n“Deed, thin, an I think they must have kept it all to thimselves here in\r\nCheater, so I do, or else we’d have heard some talk about it at school,\r\nso we would; an if there’s any talk about it now through the country,\r\nit’s something new entirely, so it is, and is the doin of this new\r\ncompany, sure.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see what we can do,” said Bart, in a dejected tone; “we can’t\r\ndo a single thing.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, thin,” said Pat, “but it’s meself that’s boon thinkin different;\r\nan I don’t know now but what the chances for us are better thin they\r\nwere before.”\r\n\r\n“Chances for us better? What in the world do you mean by that?” asked\r\nBart, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s plain enough. Ye see that treasure was a hundred feet an\r\nmore under ground, an so it was clane beyond anything that we could do\r\nBut these companies have been a workin, an a diggin, an a pumpin, an a\r\nborin holes all about, an we’ve got that much of the work done.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but what good ’ll that do us? These holes weren’t any good to\r\nthe companies. They couldn’t get to the money-hole, after all.”\r\n\r\n“Yis, but sure an may be they didn’t go to work the right way.”\r\n\r\n“O, I dare say they did all that could be done; and I don’t see how\r\nanybody could do any more, except they get a steam engine, the way they\r\n’re going to do.”\r\n\r\n“O, sure an that’s all very well; but still, whin the holes ere already\r\nbored, the hardest of the work’s done; an a handy boy might be more use\r\nthan a stame ingin, so he might. Sore an I’d like to see meself at the\r\nbottom of one of thim pits that’s nearest to the money-hole. I’d make a\r\ngrab for the trisure, so I would.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh, nonsense! What could you do?”\r\n\r\n“Sure I’d make a dash for it. There’s nothin like tryin. Nothin venture,\r\nnothin have. I’ve got a notion that a body might make a bit of a tunnel\r\nin undor there, an git at the money-box. At any rate it’s worth tryin\r\nfor, so it is.”\r\n\r\n“A tunnol!” exclaimed Bart “I never thought of that Do you really think\r\nthat you could do it?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” said Pat “Sure I’ve seen it done. All ye’ve got to do is to\r\nhave on archway, an there it is. It’ll howld till doomsday. A tunnol is\r\nit? Sure I’d like to see meself down there with a bit of a pick, an I’d\r\nsoon have the tunnel. An besides, it’s only blue clay I’d have to work\r\nin.”\r\n\r\n“So it is,” said Burt, in great excitement “He said blue clay. It’s only\r\nin the money-hole where the sand and gravel are.”\r\n\r\n“An blue clay,” said Pat, “to my mind, is as aisy cuttin as chalk or\r\nchaise. It’s like cuttin into butther, so it is. Why, there’s nothin\r\nin the wide wurrld to hender you an me from goin down there an tannelin\r\nthrough the blue day from the nearest pit straight into the money-hole.”\r\n\r\n“But what can we do about the water rushing in?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“Sure an we can only try,” said Pat “If we can’t kape the water out,\r\nwell give up. But we may work along so as to kape clear of the water.”\r\n\r\n“But can we do that?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“Do it?” said Pat. “Sure an what’s to hender us?”\r\n\r\n“The other workmen couldn’t, you know,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know it,” said Pat, “an you don’t, either. How do we know that\r\nthey ever tried? They dug the pits to try and stop the drain; that’s\r\nwhat they tried to do. But we’re a goin to try to tunnel into the\r\nmoney-hole; an there’s all the difference in the wurruld between the\r\ntwo, so there is. Besides, there’s no harrum in tryin. If we can’t do it\r\nwe can come back, an no harrum done.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we tell the other follows?” said Bart, after a thoughtful pause.\r\n\r\n“Sorra a one of them,” said Pat. “Tell them, is it? Not me. What for?\r\nSure only two can work in a hole at a time, an that’s me an you; an what\r\ndo we wont of any more? We’ll tell them after we’ve got the trisure;\r\nand thin we’ll all go halves all around, so we will; only well have the\r\nglory of gettin it, an no harruum done to anybody.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it isn’t a bad idea,” said Bart, thoughtfully. “The other fellows\r\nneedn’t know. They haven’t heard the story, and perhaps won’t hear\r\nit; at any rate, not before to-morrow; and it’s a crazy sort of an\r\nundertaking, and mayn’t amount to anything; so, as you say, Pat, it may\r\nbe best for us to start off, us two, on our own hooks, and investigate.\r\nMy idea is, for us to get off there in a quiet way, land on Oak Island,\r\nand look around to see if any of the holes are suitable.”\r\n\r\n“Shuitable!” said Pat. “Sure they’ll all shuit, so they will, if\r\nthey ain’t full of water. All we want is, a impty pit, within aisy an\r\naccissible distance of the money-hole for us to tunnel.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s what we’ll have to find out first. But when can we go?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow morning,” said Pat, “airly.”\r\n\r\n“But we’re going to Aspotogon,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Sure an we may slip off an let the others go by thimselves. We’ll go\r\nto Oak Island at four in the morrnin, an ’ll be back by nine or\r\ntin--about the time when they’re startin. If they wait for us, all\r\nright; we may go with them there or not, just as it shuits us; that\r\ndepinds on the prospects at Oak Island. But if they don’t wait for us it\r\nwon’t make any difference in the wurruld, so it won’t.”\r\n\r\nAfter some further conversation, the two boys resolved to carry out\r\nthis proposal. They thought they could easily leave the hotel on the\r\nfollowing morning, at the earliest light, and then go off to explore Oak\r\nIsland by themselves. The others would not probably start for Aspotogon\r\nbefore nine or ten. If they found Oak Island affording no prospect of\r\nsuccess in their plan, they could easily return to Chester, in time to\r\nstart for Aspotogon with the others; while if, on the other hand, they\r\ndid see any chance to make Pat’s tunnel, they could remain there and go\r\nto work. The others would probably think they had gone fishing, and set\r\noff without them.\r\n\r\nThe proposal of Pat was a wild and impracticable one, but to Bart it\r\nseemed easy enough. The thing that had influenced him most was the idea\r\nof a “tunnel,” of which Pat spoke so knowingly. Without having any very\r\ndistinct conception of the difficulties in the way of a “tunnel,” he\r\nallowed himself to be fascinated by the very mention of it, and so flung\r\nhimself headlong into the scheme.\r\n\r\nTheir determination to keep this plan a secret from the others, did not,\r\nof course, arise out of any desire to forestall them, or to seize for\r\nthemselves the treasure which they supposed to be on the island. It was\r\nrather the design of achieving some exploit which should astonish their\r\nfriends. It was glory, not covetousness, that animated them.\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind, then, and with this purpose, they returned to\r\nthe inn. Nothing was said about Oak Island. The landlord himself did not\r\nrefer to it. Perhaps he had talked enough about it for one day, and was\r\ntired of it; or perhaps he was merely husbanding his resources, so as to\r\ntell it with full effect on the following day to those of the party who\r\nhad not yet heard it; for when a man has a good story, and meets with a\r\nperfectly fresh crowd of hearers, he naturally feels unwilling to\r\nthrow the story away, and prefers to toll it under the best possible\r\ncircumstances. That evening they talked chiefly about the expedition to\r\nAspotogon. Bruce, Arthur, Tom, and Phil did the talking. Bart and Pat\r\nwere comparatively silent. The first four said nothing, however, about\r\nthe buccaneers, for they, like the landlord, were reserving this\r\nsubject for the following day. They also had all conceived the idea that\r\nAspotogon was the very place where the treasure of the buccaneers might\r\nbe buried; and this, of course, threw additional attractions around the\r\nproposed trip. The name seemed suitable to such a deed. It was sonorous\r\nand impressive; and to them it seemed to suggest all sorts of possible\r\ncrimes and tragedies. Deep Cove, also, was a name not without its\r\nsignificance; and they fancied in this place they might find the\r\nhiding-place of the old pirates of which the governor of Sable Island\r\nhad spoken.\r\n\r\nBefore retiring, they decided that they would not start till nine\r\no’clock, which hour would be most convenient for all, especially the\r\nlandlord, who protested against getting out of bed at any unusually\r\nearly hour. With this understanding they all retired.\r\n\r\nBut Bart and Pat were awake and up before the dawn. Dressing themselves\r\nhastily, they quitted the house as noiselessly as possible, and went\r\noff to the promenade or square, at the end of the town. Here a number of\r\nboats were drawn up on the beach. At that early hour it was impossible\r\nto find any owner; nor did Bart or Pat feel inclined to stand on any\r\nceremony. They selected the best of them, and thought that on their\r\nreturn they might apologize to the owner, whoever he might turn out to\r\nbe, and pay him for the use of the boat.\r\n\r\nThe question now was, how to find Oak Island. That the island was\r\nsomewhere in the bay on this side of Chester they knew from what the\r\nlandlord had told them, but which particular one it might be among the\r\nhundreds of the bay they could not imagine. The knowledge that it was\r\ncovered with oaks, was the only guide they had; and with this they set\r\nforth, hoping to find the object of their search. There was a sail in\r\nthe boat, and a pair of oars, and a gentle breeze was blowing; so they\r\nhoisted the sail, and slipped at a very good pace over the water. On\r\ntheir way they passed several islands. One of these had farm-houses on\r\nit; another had no houses at all; but still they saw nothing of those\r\noak trees, and frames, and pumps, and other engines which marked Oak\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThey kept on; however, sailing past some islands, and around others,\r\nuntil more than an hour had passed, and they both concluded that it\r\nwould be far better to go ashore somewhere and ask directions. They\r\nsaw a house not far away on the main land, and at once sailed in this\r\ndirection. The wind still continued very moderate, and though neither\r\nBart nor Pat knew much about navigating a boat, they managed to get\r\nalong in this breeze without any trouble whatever.\r\n\r\nOn landing, Pat remained in the boat, while Bart went to the house just\r\nmentioned. On his way he crossed the high road which here runs along the\r\nshore, winding beautifully around every curve and inlet as it encircles\r\nthe bay. Bart had some difficulty in rousing the people, for it was\r\nyet very early in the morning, and they were all sound asleep. At last,\r\nhowever, he heard sounds of movement inside, and then a man appeared,\r\nhalf dressed, and rubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” said Bart, pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“Morn’n, said the man, with a yawn.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me where I can find Oak Island?”\r\n\r\n“Oak Island?” repeated the man, stretching himself with another yawn and\r\nlooking at Bart,--“Oak Island?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart; “Oak Island.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you ain’t a tryin to walk there, surely!” said the man, in some\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n“O, no,” said Bart; “that’s my boat just down there.”\r\n\r\n“O,” said the man. “Wal, Oak Island’s jest over there;” and he pointed\r\nup the bay farther, in a direction which Bart had not taken at all. “You\r\ngo straight up about two miles from here, an you’ll hit it. You can’t\r\nmistake it. It’s a little island with some oak trees and some stagins.”\r\n\r\n“There’s no one there now, I suppose,” said Bart. “No,” said the man,\r\n“not jest now. They’ve knocked off,--the last batch did,--and there\r\nain’t likely to be no more till the next lot of fools turns up that’s\r\ngot more money than brains.”\r\n\r\nFrom which remark Bart gathered that the man was an unbeliever.\r\n\r\n“You don’t seem to believe in Kidd’s treasure,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said the man, “I ain’t goin to say that; but I’ll tell you what\r\nI don’t believe in. I don’t believe in people a throwin of their money\r\naway into the airth an into the sea when they might be doin better with\r\nit. Yes, a throwin of it away, tryin to get at a money-box that’s out\r\nof the power of man to touch. Yes, sir; flesh and blood won’t never\r\nlay hands on Kidd’s treasure--leastways not unless there’s a sacrifice\r\nmade.”\r\n\r\n“A sacrifice!” repeated Bart, in amazement. “Yes,” said the man. “It’s\r\nan old sayin hereabouts, as to the fact as that that thar treasure bein\r\nburied there with the sacrifice of human life, is laid under a cuss, and\r\nthe cuss can’t ever be lifted, nor the money-box either, till some of\r\nthe diggers kills a man. That’s the old sayin; an mind you, it’ll have\r\nto come to that. Blood must be shed!”\r\n\r\nThe man uttered these last words in a deep tone, that suggested all\r\nsorts of superstitious horrors; and from the tenor of these last\r\nremarks, Bart perceived that this man, far from being an unbeliever, as\r\nhe had at first supposed, was one of the firmest possible believers,\r\nand surrounded his belief with the accompaniments of the darkest\r\nsuperstition. To Bart this only served to intensify the interest\r\nwhich he already felt in Oak Island; for he saw that the people of\r\nthe neighborhood were the firmest believers in the existence of the\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\nA few more questions followed, referring chiefly to the appearance of\r\nthe island; and having at length gathered all the information that he\r\nwanted, Bart returned to the boat, and once more the two boys proceeded\r\non their way. The place towards which the man had pointed was straight\r\nbefore them, and every little while grew more and more plainly defined\r\nagainst the line of land beyond, until at length they could see that it\r\nwas an island. Nearer and nearer they drew, and gradually they saw the\r\noak trees, which differed from the trees of the other islands. The trees\r\nstood apart more like a grove planted by man than a forest of nature’s\r\nplanting. Other signs soon appeared; a rough hut, some stagings in\r\ndifferent places, of peculiar construction, and here and there mounds of\r\nearth. There could be no doubt about it. This was the place which they\r\nsought. This was the home of the buccaneers; the haunt of Captain Kidd;\r\nthe place where lay buried far down in the earth, and far beneath the\r\nsea, the plunder of the Spanish Main!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n_The Isle of the Pirates.--The Oaks and the Mounds.--A Survey.--The\r\nflooded Pits.--The empty Pit.--The Staying.--The Money-hole.--The Hut\r\nand its Contents.--The Stone with the Inscription.--Preparations for\r\na Descent.--The Rope and the Beam.--Pat’s Plan with the Pickaxe.--Bart\r\ngoes down.--All right.--Come along.--Pat goes down.--Terrific Result.\r\nThe Sword of Damocles._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE bows of the boat grated on the pebbled beach, and Bart and Pat\r\nstepped ashore. On landing, their first thought was to secure the boat.\r\nThis was not a difficult task.\r\n\r\nClose by them was a tree, growing near the beach, and all that they had\r\nto do was to draw the boat up for a short distance, and fasten a line\r\naround the tree. After this, they stood by the boat for a little while,\r\nand looked at the island upon which they had landed.\r\n\r\nIt was small, not over a quarter of a mile across, and rose gently from\r\nthe sea to a height of not more than thirty feet. Oak trees, planted at\r\nconsiderable intervals, grew over the surface, none of them being of any\r\nvery great size. Under these there was, in some places, a thick turf,\r\nwhich looked as though the ground had once been cultivated, and had run\r\nout, while in other places it was rough, and rose in those mossy mounds\r\nor cradles which characterize soil that has been cleared, but has never\r\nbeen subject to cultivation.\r\n\r\nAs they stood here and looked at the scene before them, they saw, not\r\nvery far away, a mound of earth. They had seen this from the boat as\r\nthey approached, and had at once thought that it might be the very\r\nground removed from the earth in forming one of the numerous pits. In\r\ndigging these pits the earth would be raised, and thrown on one side.\r\n\r\n“Sure that’s what I towld ye,” said Pat. “Ye know there must be a deep\r\nhole from the height of it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart. “There must be a hole there. Come, let’s have a look\r\nat it.”\r\n\r\nWith these words the two started forward, and walked towards the heap of\r\nearth. As they came up, they noticed that the soil consisted of clay of\r\na dull bluish tinge, like pale slate, and they recognized at once the\r\nbluish clay of which the landlord had spoken. The heap of earth was of\r\nconsiderable dimensions. They both walked up it, and on reaching the\r\ntop, they saw on the other side an opening in the ground. Hurrying down\r\ntowards it, they recognized in it at once one of those pits made by some\r\none of the companies digging here. The mouth of it was about six feet\r\nlong and four feet wide. The sides were stayed up by planks. They could\r\nnot see far down, however, for the pit contained water, which came to\r\nwithin a dozen feet of the surface. How deep the pit was they could\r\nnot see; but they at once conjectured that this was one of those pits\r\nmentioned by the landlord, where the diggers in search of the “drain”\r\n had broken into it, and had thus been compelled to fly from the waters\r\nthat poured in upon them. This pit was flooded (as the landlord had\r\nsaid) from “Kidd’s drain.”\r\n\r\nAfter examining this pit, they proceeded farther, and saw another mound\r\nnot far away. It was just like this, of about the same dimensions, and\r\nconsisting of the same bluish clay. To this they directed their steps,\r\nknowing now that another pit might be expected here, and in this\r\nexpectation they were not disappointed. There was a pit here of\r\nprecisely the same appearance as the one which they had just examined,\r\nstayed up in the same way around the sides by stout planks, and of about\r\nthe same size. Like the other, it was also full of water. Here too,\r\nthen, as they thought, the diggers had broken into the “drain,” and had\r\nflooded the pit. The occurrence of these two pits, both full of water,\r\nshowed them, in a very striking and very significant manner, the\r\ndifficulties that those encountered who sought to penetrate to the\r\nhidden treasure.\r\n\r\nBut the boys were curious to see some pit that might not be full of\r\nwater, so as to see with their own eyes the depth of these excavations.\r\nThe landlord had mentioned a hundred feet. Such a depth as that, they\r\nknew, exceeded the height of an ordinary church spire, and they both\r\nwondered whether it would be possible for them to descend. They,\r\ntherefore, turned away from this pit after a slight examination, and\r\nlooked around for others.\r\n\r\nSeveral mounds appeared not very far away, and they at once went off to\r\nthe nearest of these. Here, then, was a pit which was also flooded. The\r\nsight of this third pit, full of water, made them fear that this was\r\nthe condition of all of them, and their discouragement was consequently\r\ngreat; however, they had not yet examined all, and two or three other\r\nmounds yet remained to be visited. They went on, therefore, to the next;\r\nand here, on reaching the pit which adjoined it, they found, to their\r\ngreat delight, that it was dry.\r\n\r\nDry and deep. The hundred feet which the landlord had spoken of seemed\r\nto be a moderate estimate for this pit. Its length and width at the\r\nmouth were the same as those of the others; and the staying of the\r\nsides with stout planks was the same. On looking down, they could see no\r\nbottom. Bart took a stone and dropped it, and the time which was taken\r\nup in the fall to the bottom seemed to fully warrant the estimate above\r\nmentioned. But such a pit as this did not appear to offer much chance\r\nof descending into it. None of the pulleys or windlasses which must once\r\nhave been used here to lower the workmen, or hoist up the earth, now\r\nremained. The planks used as staying were over an inch apart, and these\r\noffered occasional spaces which might possibly be used as a foothold.\r\nStill, to climb down here without some sort of a rope was not to be\r\nthought of, and though Bart and Pat were both excellent climbers, they\r\nboth saw at once that this was a task beyond their powers. And they had\r\nnot brought a rope with them.\r\n\r\nOn looking around once more, they saw at no very great distance a\r\nstaging, which at once reminded them of the directions given them by the\r\nman on the shore, and also of the words of the landlord. This staging\r\nthey had also noticed as they approached the island in the boat. They\r\nnow set out for this, and reached it in a short time. This staging\r\nwas about the highest point on the island, and was in the midst of an\r\nimmense collection of mounds of earth, and sand, and blue clay. As they\r\nstood here, they could see several pits around them; but their attention\r\nwas at once arrested by one place close by the staging. It was a hollow\r\nin the earth, shaped like a bowl, about twenty feet in diameter, and\r\nperhaps the same depth. At once the landlord’s description of the\r\npresent appearance of the “money-hole” flashed across their memories.\r\n\r\nThis, then, must be the place,--this bowl-shaped hollow. There could be\r\nno doubt about it. This must be the spot chosen by the buccaneers for\r\nthat pit in which they were to hide their treasure. Here beneath,--far\r\nbeneath,--lay concealed the plunder of the Spanish Main. Here was that\r\nblasted circular spot, with the blighted tree, and the decayed pulley,\r\nwhich had revealed the secret to the first diggers. Here those two had\r\nworked who had so nearly reached the treasure, and this bowl-shaped\r\ncavity showed them what appeared to the eyes of those first diggers,\r\nwhen, after they had just touched the treasure, they went forth on\r\nthe following morning to see their labor destroyed, and all their toil\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\nAround this were the signs of other labors, and the unmistakable traces\r\nof all the toilers, who in succession had labored here. Some pits had\r\ncaved in, like the original “money-hole.” Others had filled with water.\r\nThe sand, gravel, and clay, that had been drawn up out of these various\r\nexcavations, covered a large space. Close by a pit, which lay nearest\r\nto the “money-hole,” rose the staging which had attracted them. On\r\nexamining this, its purpose was at once evident. It was erected so as to\r\nallow of the working of pumps by horse-power. The circle was there which\r\nthe horses traversed, and all the machinery was in perfect order. They\r\nunderstood the purpose of this machine at once from the landlord’s\r\nstory. It had been intended to reach the bottom of the “money-hole” by\r\na new pit, and this pit was to be kept dry by pumping. The pit must\r\nevidently be the one which immediately adjoined the “money-hole.” But\r\nhow completely this plan had failed, was now evident to them from this\r\npit itself, which, like the others that they had first seen, was full\r\nof water. This pit had proved of no avail against “Kidd’s drain.”\r\n Horse-power had been weak against the tides of the sea. Here was the\r\nmelancholy result--a failure complete and utter; a pit flooded; engines\r\nuseless; costly works deserted. Would the attempt ever be made again? or\r\nif so, would steam succeed when pitted against the waters of the ocean?\r\n\r\nThey went down into the bowl-shaped cavity which marked the\r\n“money-hole,”--they did so cautiously, for they had vague fears of\r\nquicksand. But their fears were idle. The ground seemed as hard and as\r\nsolid as on any other part of the island. They stood there, and stamped,\r\nand jumped, but the firm soil yielded not. They could scarcely believe\r\nthat this was the very central point affected by the waters of the sea.\r\nAnd yet this must be so, for this was the point to which the “drain”\r\n had been directed, and far down the waters guarded the treasure from the\r\nhand of man.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining here for a time, they emerged from the cavity, and\r\ntheir attention was next attracted by a hut not far away. To this they\r\ndirected their steps. They found the door wide open, and entered. Inside\r\nthey saw two rooms divided by a board partition, with a chimney rising\r\nin the middle. This had been the place where the workmen lived, for\r\nsigns of these occupants were still visible around. The two rooms\r\nwere filled with spades, and chains, and boxes, and a miscellaneous\r\ncollection of articles that had probably been used by the last\r\nexcavators, and had been left here in anticipation of further use. Among\r\nthese they saw a quantity of ropes in coils of different sizes; and they\r\nsaw at once that if they wished to go down into any one of the pits, a\r\nway of descending was now supplied.\r\n\r\nThe chimney at once suggested to their minds the remarks of the landlord\r\nabout the stone with the inscription. To the boys that stone seemed\r\nthe most important part of the whole story, and offered a more direct\r\nevidence as to its truth than anything else. They wished to see it, and\r\njudge for themselves. They accordingly examined the chimney on every\r\nside, but, to their very great disappointment, could not see anything\r\nof the kind. At length Bart found a place in the chimney from which a\r\nportion seemed to have been detached, and he at once declared that this\r\nmust have been the place where the stone was, and that it had probably\r\nbeen taken away, so as to be made use of for the purpose of affecting\r\nthe public mind, and inducing people to take stock in the new company.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the ropes at once awakened within them a desire to put in\r\npractice their intention of descending into one of the pits. It did not\r\nseem to them to be dangerous. Bart was as active as a cat in climbing,\r\nespecially when he had anything to do with ropes; while Pat, though not\r\nequal to him in this respect, was still quite able to do any ordinary\r\nwork of the kind. One of the pits, as they had seen, was dry, but it was\r\na little too far away. They wished to find one which was rather nearer\r\nthe “money-hole,” where there might be some chance of putting into\r\npractice Pat’s idea about the tunnel. No thought of danger entered into\r\ntheir minds, no dread of the treacherous waters which had broken through\r\ninto the other holes, and flooded them. They prepared to put their\r\nscheme into execution as calmly as if it was no more than climbing a\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nBut first they must seek a pit nearer the “money-hole;” and with this\r\nintention they went back to that central spot, where they examined the\r\npits in its neighborhood. To their great joy they soon found one. It was\r\non the side opposite to that where the staging had been erected, and was\r\nquite dry. This they knew by dropping stones down, and listening to\r\nthe sound made when they struck. All of them fell with a dull thud, and\r\nwithout any splashing noise, such as would have been produced had water\r\nbeen there.\r\n\r\nThis at once decided them in favor of the pit just mentioned: and the\r\nnext thing was, how to arrange the rope so as to make the descent.\r\nOne could not lower the other; and if such a thing had been possible,\r\nneither one would have been willing to stay up. There was therefore\r\nnothing for them to do but to adopt the simple plan of climbing down by\r\nmeans of a rope secured to the top. First of all they had to select the\r\nrope. This they did without much delay. Among the various coils in the\r\nhut, one seemed suitable from size and quality. It had been used, like\r\nall the others; it seemed perfectly strong enough; and it was also\r\nsufficiently soft and smooth to the hands. This coil was therefore\r\nselected and brought to the place. A stone was quickly attached to\r\none end, and was thrown down. The rope fell all the way to the bottom\r\nwithout being more than half expended. The rest of the coil lay at the\r\nedge of the pit.\r\n\r\nAnd now how were they to secure this, so as to descend? Something was\r\nneeded which might bear their weight. At first they thought of tying the\r\nupper part of the rope to one of the planks which formed the staying\r\nof the sides of the pit; but this did not seem strong enough. They then\r\nwent off to hunt up something. In the house there was a crowbar, which\r\nwas strong enough, yet not long enough, to satisfy them. But outside\r\nof the house there was a large beam, fully twelve feet long and eight\r\ninches thick. This seemed to be the very thing. It was apparently sound\r\nand strong, and, as far as they could see, was quite able to support ten\r\ntimes the weight to which it would be subjected. This beam therefore was\r\nchosen without the slightest hesitation, and Bart and Pat, taking it\r\nup in their arms, carried it to the mouth of the pit; then they laid it\r\nacross, and tied the rope about it as securely as possible.\r\n\r\nAll now seemed perfectly safe, and nothing remained but to make the\r\ndescent. Bart went first. The planks used for staying around the sides\r\nof the pit were far enough apart to offer here and there interstices\r\nin which the feet might be inserted, though in many of these places the\r\nearth bulged through so as to prevent a foothold. They thus afforded\r\nassistance; and Bart, as he began his descent, availed himself of it. As\r\nhe went down, Pat watched him anxiously from above. Before his head had\r\ndisappeared, he said,--\r\n\r\n“O, by the way, Pat! throw down that pickaxe.”\r\n\r\nFor Pat had brought a pickaxe from the hut, in order to make his tunnel;\r\nand it was now lying on the ground, close by.\r\n\r\n“Sure, but I was goin to wait till you got down.”\r\n\r\n“What! and throw it on my head! No, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an I niver thought of that at all at all,” said Pat; “and it’s\r\nlucky for you that you thought of it just now.”\r\n\r\nWith these words Pat dropped the pickaxe into the pit, and it fell with\r\na dull thud far down at the bottom.\r\n\r\nBart now continued his descent, and Pat watched him all the way. At\r\nlength a voice came up from far below,--\r\n\r\n“All right! Come along!”\r\n\r\nUpon this Pat descended, and went down cautiously and carefully,\r\nclinging with feet and hands to the rope and to the sides of the pit. He\r\nwas not so dexterous as Bart, and once or twice he lost his foothold\r\non the side of the pit, and slid for several feet, the rope cutting\r\nhis hands; but still he kept on, for Bart was waiting for him, and\r\nencouraging him.\r\n\r\nAt length, when about thirty feet from the bottom, where Bart was\r\nstanding, he found a place where he could stick his foot, and waited for\r\na moment to look down through the darkness. He could see nothing. As he\r\nlooked, his foot slipped from the place, and he fell with a jerk, the\r\nrope sliding painfully through his chafed hands. At that very instant it\r\nseemed to him that the rope itself was falling. From above there came a\r\ndull creaking sound, and from below a cry of horror burst from Bart. At\r\nthat instant, Pat’s feet touched the bottom of the pit.\r\n\r\nBart grasped his arm convulsively, and pointed upward.\r\n\r\n“The beam! the beam!” he almost screamed. “It’s broke. O, what shall we\r\ndo!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0137]\r\n\r\nPat looked up; and there, clearly defined against the sky, he saw the\r\nbeam around which the rope was fastened, no longer lying straight across\r\nthe mouth of the pit, but sagging down in the middle at a sharp angle.\r\nIt had been rotten in the middle. It had cracked at that last jerk\r\noccasioned by his fall from his foothold; and it now hung broken midway,\r\nstill clinging together by a few fibres, but suspended there above them,\r\nlike the sword of Damocles, as if by a single hair, and threatening\r\nevery instant to fall and crush them.\r\n\r\nThe rope and the beam had both been rotten, and the jerk which had been\r\ngiven when Pat lost his foothold had cracked the one and broken the\r\nother. There, about thirty feet above them, hung the end of the rope\r\nwhere it had parted. The rest of it was still in Pat’s hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n_The missing Ones.--What has become of them?--Theories about Bart and\r\nPat.--The Decision.--A new Disappointment, and a very serious one.--A\r\nbad Substitute.--The Voyage to Aspotogon.--The mysterious Cove.--A\r\nromantic Spot.--Picturesque Scenery.--Speculations about the\r\nBuccaneers.--The very Place.--The Knoll.--New Themes.--The Mound over\r\nthe Treasure of the Seas.--Plans to get at said Treasure.--A most\r\nunpleasant Discovery.--Their Plans knocked in the Head.--New Plans, by\r\nwhich to avoid all Difficulties._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE other boys rose that morning at the usual hour, and descended\r\nleisurely to breakfast. The absence of Bart and Pat was noticed and\r\ncommented on. It was supposed, however, that they had gone off somewhere\r\nto get up an appetite for breakfast, and that they would be along before\r\nthe meal was over. Time passed, and the breakfast was ended; but still\r\nno signs appeared of the absentees. It was now nearly time to start,\r\nand they all strolled down to the wharf where the Antelope was, thinking\r\nthat the two boys might possibly be there. On reaching the place they\r\nlooked around, but saw no signs of them. Captain Corbet had not seen\r\nthem, nor had Solomon. Everything was ready, and it was only a few\r\nminutes of the time.\r\n\r\n“It’s queer where those fellows can have gone to,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“They’ve gone on a walk, of course,” said Arthur; “and I dare say\r\nthey’ve gone farther than they intended.”\r\n\r\n“O, they’ll be along soon,” said Phil, “and won’t they be half starved?\r\nMethinks!”\r\n\r\n“It’s a strange thing,” said Tom, “that they should have slipped off in\r\nthis way. No one knows anything about them. No one at the inn saw them\r\ngo out. They must have got up precious early.”\r\n\r\n“Well, they’re both rather early risers,” said Arthur; “and they may\r\nhave gone off fishing.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say they have,” said Bruce. “Bart is crazy about fishing, and\r\nif he has got one solitary bite, he’ll give up the expedition to\r\nAspotogon.”\r\n\r\n“And Pat’s as bad, every bit,” said Phil. “Depend upon it, those two\r\nhave gone out to catch fish for breakfast, and won’t be back till\r\nsomewhere about evening.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Tom, “I shouldn’t wonder if they’ve both backed out\r\ndeliberately.”\r\n\r\n“Backed out?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I don’t believe they cared about going to Aspotogon.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! nonsense! What makes you think that?”\r\n\r\n“Why, last evening I noticed that they didn’t say a single word. Both of\r\nthose fellows were as muni as mice, and all the rest of us were in full\r\ncry about the expedition. Depend upon it, they didn’t want to go, and\r\nhave backed out. They didn’t want to say anything about it, for fear\r\nwe’d tease them to come, but quietly dropped off, leaving us to go\r\nwithout them. O, that’s the way, beyond a doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Now that you mention it, Tom,” said Phil, “I do remember that they\r\ndidn’t say anything last night, neither of them.”\r\n\r\n“Neither did they,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Pact,” said Bruce; “it looks very much as if they had talked the matter\r\nover, and concluded to back out in this quiet way; and I don’t know but\r\nwhat they have concocted some scheme of their own.”\r\n\r\n“O, some fishing scheme, of course. Bart was crazy about it, you know,\r\nand he’s persuaded Pat to go with him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, in that case we needn’t wait.”\r\n\r\n“O, we may as well hang on till ten--in case they should turn up after\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the opinion, then, to which the other boys came, about the\r\ndisappearance of Bart and Pat. It was a perfectly natural one under\r\nthe circumstances. Bart and Pat were distinguished above all things for\r\ntheir fondness for fishing; their silence during the conversation of the\r\npreceding evening really made it seem as though they had no desire to\r\ngo to Aspotogon, but had some plan of their own. This plan seemed to the\r\nboys to be undoubtedly a fishing expedition. There was, therefore, not\r\nthe slightest feeling of uneasiness in the mind of any of them, nor did\r\neven Captain Corbet, who had listened to the conversation, imagine that\r\nthere was any cause for alarm. To have imagined danger to them in such\r\na place as this, on dry ground, in a civilized country, was out of the\r\nquestion. Notwithstanding this conviction, they thought it possible,\r\nhowever, that the two might yet return in time, and therefore they\r\ndecided to wait for them till ten.\r\n\r\nThe conversation about Bart and Pat was suddenly interrupted by the\r\nappearance of the landlord, who brought them another disappointment. He\r\ntold them that important business had most unexpectedly required him to\r\ngo up the country for twenty miles or so, and that he should not be able\r\nto accompany them. He expressed the greatest possible regret, and\r\nthe boys expressed still more. They at once offered to postpone their\r\nexpedition till the following day; but the landlord was not certain\r\nwhether he should be back by that time or not, and advised them to\r\ngo without him. He said a friend of his would go, who knew the whole\r\ncountry, and could tell them all that they wanted to know about it.\r\n\r\nGreat was the disappointment of the boys at this unexpected occurrence.\r\nThey had particularly wished to have the landlord’s company, for reasons\r\nalready stated. He was so genial, so communicative, and so destitute of\r\ninquisitiveness, that he seemed the very man whom they might be able to\r\npump to their hearts’ content, without making their purpose apparent\r\nto him. One great charm of the expedition lay in their belief that\r\nAspotogon and Deep Cove had been the haunts of the buccaneers, and that\r\nthe landlord would show them the traditionary place where the treasure\r\nhad been deposited. They did not think that another man could supply his\r\nplace; and when, shortly after, the landlord brought his friend along,\r\nthey were sure of it. For the friend, whose name the landlord gave as\r\nTurnbull, was a heavy, dull-looking man, and the last in the world whom\r\nthey would have chosen in the landlord’s place. However, there was no\r\nhelp for it. It was useless to postpone it, and, consequently, at ten\r\no’clock the Antelope started on her voyage.\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the little harbor of Chester into the bay, the scene\r\nthat presented itself was beautiful in the extreme. Much of it was\r\nfamiliar to their eyes, owing to their previous cruise about the bay\r\non the first day of their arrival; but they now saw it under a somewhat\r\ndifferent aspect.\r\n\r\nOn one side arose an island, bare of trees, and covered with grass, of\r\nno great size, but conspicuous from its position. In its neighborhood\r\nwere other islands, some all wooded from the shore to the summit, others\r\nshowing green meadows peeping forth from encircling foliage. Before them\r\nspread the shores of Tancook, all green with verdure, dotted with white\r\nhouses, and showing, here and there, the darker hue of forest trees,\r\namid the green, grassy meadows. Beyond this, and far out to sea, was\r\nIronbound, which, from this distance, looked dark and repellent. It\r\nwas more wooded than the other islands, and did not seem popular as a\r\ndwelling-place. Naturally so, for at that distance out, it was exposed\r\nto the storms and the fogs of the ocean, while those islands within the\r\nbay were in the possession of a far more genial soil and climate. On\r\nthe left, the coast-line ran on beyond a neighboring point, till it\r\nterminated in a distant headland; and here, on that line of coast,\r\nseveral miles this side of the headland, the land arose to a wooded\r\neminence, which was no other than the very place which they were\r\nseeking--Aspotogon.\r\n\r\nThe boys were disappointed, for they had expected something much higher.\r\nIt did not seem to them to be more than a very ordinary hill, nor did it\r\nrise very high above the level of the surrounding land. Still, they were\r\nwilling to be pleased, and therefore tried to think that it might really\r\nbe much higher than it seemed.\r\n\r\nThe line of coast ran on, showing cleared fields along the shore, which,\r\nfarther back, were succeeded by wooded slopes. In this line of shore\r\nthere did not appear the slightest opening, nor could they imagine how\r\nit was possible for a schooner to reach the base of Aspotogon. That\r\nthere was a passage, however, they were again and again assured by\r\nTurnbull, who, though not at all inclined to give any information, was\r\nyet capable of answering direct questions, and telling the names of\r\nplaces. The existence of a cove, or strait, in such a place, where there\r\nseemed nothing but an unbroken line of coast, gave additional strength\r\nto that fancy in which the boys had already been indulging, and made\r\nthem think that this place, so completely hidden, must be, above all\r\nothers, the place once chosen as a secure retreat by the buccaneers.\r\nThis feeling gained strength as they went on. The distance was not far.\r\nThe wind was fair. The Antelope did her best, and so they gradually drew\r\nnearer and nearer. Still, no sign appeared of any opening, nor could\r\nthey make out any place where an opening might be likely to be found.\r\nAt last Turnbull remarked that this was the place, and that the Antelope\r\nwould have to anchor here, as it would be inconvenient, in this wind, to\r\nget out of Deep Cove if they were to enter it in the schooner. Down went\r\nthe Antelope’s anchor, and the boat was hauled up alongside.\r\n\r\nThey were not more than a quarter of a mile from the shore. Deep Cove\r\nwas there,--for so Turnbull said,--and they were about to visit it, yet\r\nthere was still no more appearance of any opening than before. The shore\r\nseemed to run on without any break, and the boys sought in vain to find\r\nsome place into which a boat might go; but the boat was ready, and this\r\nmystery was soon to be solved.\r\n\r\nThey drew very near to the shore before the long-sought-for opening\r\nappeared. The opening was at such an angle that it could not be detected\r\nfrom the direction in which they had approached, and the curve made by\r\nthe cove was of such a kind that it was difficult to detect it from any\r\ndirection. On entering it they saw that it was deep and spacious, with\r\nthe shore on one side covered with forest trees, and on the other side\r\ncleared. Rowing on a little farther, the cove curved, and the cleared\r\nland was left behind. Now a scene of grandeur appeared. The cove ran\r\nbetween lofty heights, which bordered it, now with precipitous rocky\r\ncliffs, now with steep slopes, heavily wooded. After rowing a few\r\nhundred yards, it seemed as though they were shut out from all the\r\nworld. Behind and before there was a circle of hills, and they seemed to\r\nbe rather upon the bosom of some sequestered lake than upon an inlet of\r\nthe sea close by the waters of the stormy Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThey still moved on, and as they advanced, the scenery retained the same\r\ngeneral features, possessing an air of wild and romantic grandeur of the\r\nmost striking description. At length they came to a place where the cove\r\nwidened into a smooth basin, surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills.\r\nThe water was as smooth as glass, and as black as ink. This, they were\r\ninformed, was the head of the cove; and straight in front of them\r\nwas the base of Aspotogon, which was bathed by these waters. The boat\r\napproached a grassy knoll close by this, and the boys all got out.\r\n\r\nHere, then, the mystery was solved, for they had come up by this\r\npassage-way to Aspotogon itself. Close beside them there was a steep\r\ndeclivity, bare of trees just here, and covered with stones. Far up\r\ntrees began, and hid the summit of the hill.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque beauty of this place, the deep, black water, the high,\r\nencircling hills, the sombre, primeval forests, the utter seclusion, all\r\nproduced a profound impression upon the minds of the boys, who always\r\nwere alive to the beauties of nature, and who here had something in\r\naddition to natural beauty. For their thoughts turned at once to that\r\nwhich had been for days the supreme subject in their minds--the treasure\r\nof the buccaneers. Was not this the haunt of the pirates spoken of by\r\nthe governor of Sable Island. They all felt sure that it must be. No\r\nbetter place than this could be found in all the world. Here was a\r\nhiding-place without a parallel. Here a vessel might pass from the outer\r\nseas into absolute seclusion, and find a haven safe from all storms,\r\nshut in by high hills. Here, too, was a place to bury their treasure, if\r\nsuch was their desire; and, if the governor of Sable Island had spoken\r\nthe truth, the place best fitted to receive the pirate’s deposit must be\r\nthe very knoll on which they were standing.\r\n\r\nHere it was, on this spot, that they regretted most deeply the absence\r\nof the landlord. It was this knoll, above all things, that seemed to\r\nthem to contain the plunder of the Spanish Main, and they felt sure\r\nthat, if the landlord had been here, he would have told them all\r\nabout it, and confirmed their suspicions. But he was not here, and his\r\nsubstitute Turnbull was of no use whatever. He either could or would\r\ntell them nothing. He would only answer in monosyllables, and the boys,\r\nafter a fruitless effort to draw him out on the subject of Deep Cove\r\nand its local traditions, gave up the task in despair. They could only\r\nconsole themselves by the thought that they could pump the landlord on\r\ntheir return to Chester, and then, if their suspicions were confirmed,\r\nthey could visit the place again, and dig for the buried treasure.\r\n\r\nAnd what a glorious place it was to dig, if this indeed was the place\r\nwhich they supposed it to be! How completely shut out it was from all\r\nobservation. Here they might dig to their hearts’ content, and nobody\r\nwould know it. Perhaps the treasure was not very far down. The knoll\r\nrose not more than ten feet or so above the sea. Some of them, indeed,\r\nthought that the whole knoll was the work of the pirates, and was\r\nneither more nor less than the mound of earth with which they had\r\ncovered up their treasure. This view was even more charming than the\r\nother, and they went about it on every side, examining it all over, and\r\nscrutinizing it most carefully.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tom made a discovery of a very unpleasant character. As he\r\nwandered about, he found himself, all at once, upon a regular carriage\r\nroad. It was not a first-class road by any means, but it was a road for\r\nwheeled vehicles, and, from its appearance, was evidently in constant\r\nuse. The sight of this created at once a deep disappointment, in which\r\nall the others shared as soon as they saw it. They found that the\r\nseclusion of the place was broken up. To dig for gold here, by the side\r\nof a public road, would be a difficult matter, and a very different\r\nthing from what they had at first supposed. So completely had their\r\nminds been impressed by the apparent seclusion of Deep Cove, that they\r\nhad forgotten all about the houses and settlements which they had seen,\r\nonly a short time before, on the outer coast. Yet these settlements\r\nwere only a little distance away, and this was, no doubt, the road that\r\njoined them together, which had to make the circuit of Deep Cove, in\r\norder to effect a connection.\r\n\r\nThe boys now seated themselves apart, out of hearing of Turnbull, in\r\norder to discuss the situation.\r\n\r\n“There can’t be any doubt,” said Tom, “that this is the mound made by\r\nthe pirates to cover up their treasure. They didn’t dig a hole, but\r\ncovered up the treasure by piling earth over it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s about it,” said ‘Phil; “and what’s more, I don’t believe that\r\nwe’ll have to go very far down, either.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if any one has ever tried it,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it,” said Tom. “There isn’t the slightest mark on the\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“But wouldn’t people have tried it, if it is really the place?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they don’t know the actual place; and we may be the first who\r\never suspected this mound. It isn’t impossible.”\r\n\r\n“No; it may be that the people here are too dull; or it may be just a\r\nhappy guess of ours, which has never occurred to any one else.”\r\n\r\n“And this miserable road here,” said Tom, dolefully, “is going to spoil\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if we couldn’t manage to dig, in spite of the road.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Why, we might stick up the sail of the Antelope, and make a big tent,\r\nand pretend to be fishing, or roughing it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there may be something in that.”\r\n\r\n“Something! Of course there’s everything in that. I call it a good idea,\r\nand the only way we can go about it.”\r\n\r\n“But wouldn’t we be bothered with visitors?”\r\n\r\n“No; certainly not; or, at any rate, they couldn’t get in.”\r\n\r\n“They’d see the earth thrown up.”\r\n\r\n“O, we wouldn’t throw up much. I don’t believe we’d have to dig far,\r\nand we could put up both sails, so as to cover up everything. Some of us\r\ncould watch, to give notice to the diggers to knock off in case any one\r\npassed by.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s not a bad idea; and it’s the only thing we can do. So it’s\r\nworth trying.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but there’s one thing first.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Why, we’ll have to talk with the landlord, and see if we can find out\r\nfrom him what the probabilities are about this place being really the\r\nresort of the old buccaneers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n_The Ascent of Aspotogon.--Slippery Slopes.--Treacherous Stones.--\r\nTangled Thickets.--A great Disappointment.--Disgust of the Party.--A\r\nrefreshing Bath.--Exploring a Cave.--Where are the Buccaneers?--In the\r\nWater.----An Alarm.--A terrible Monster.--Fright and Flight.--?

It was not yet the appropriate time to dig into what they now all\r\ncalled the “mound,” though that would have been the most agreeable thing\r\nin the world in their present frame of mind; so they had to think of\r\nsome other form of active exercise. Phil suggested that they should\r\nclimb Aspotogon, and the suggestion was at once welcomed. Here they were\r\nat its base. They had come to visit it, and they could not be said to\r\nhave done it, unless they should also reach its summit. So no sooner was\r\nthe suggestion made than they all prepared to put it in execution.\r\n\r\nThe place which they chose for the ascent was that open spot already\r\nmentioned. Other places were overgrown with a thick forest, with\r\nunderbrush, and fallen trees. The ascent was somewhat difficult. The\r\nslope was steep, and was covered with loose stones that slid at every\r\nstep. At first, one went behind the other, but after a few paces\r\nthey found that this could only be done at the imminent risk of their\r\nprecious limbs, for the stones dislodged by the foremost climber\r\ninvariably rolled down upon the one following. They therefore avoided\r\ngoing behind any other of the party, and climbed up abreast. At length\r\nthe slope of sliding stones was traversed, and they reached a place\r\nwhich was covered with the primeval forest. Here the ascent was, if\r\npossible, even more toilsome. There was a thick underbrush through which\r\nthey had to force their way by a process which made their undeniably\r\nshabby clothes even more shabby; the ground was very irregular, now\r\nsinking into holes, again rising into low mounds; while at intervals\r\nthey would encounter some fallen tree, over which they had to climb, or\r\nelse crawl beneath it. Such were the difficulties in the way of their\r\nascent.\r\n\r\nThese, however, were all happily surmounted, and the whole party at last\r\nstood on the summit of Aspotogon. Here a deep disappointment awaited\r\nthem. They had taken for granted that they would be rewarded by an\r\nextensive view. They hoped to overlook the whole of Mahone Bay, to count\r\nits three hundred and sixty-five islands, to see the windings of Deep\r\nCove, and speculate upon the operations of the buccaneers. But instead\r\nof this they saw--nothing. For the summit of the hill was all overgrown\r\nwith trees, which shut out the whole view. Such a reward for so much\r\ntoil excited the deepest disgust.\r\n\r\n“And this is Aspotogon!” cried Bruce. “Why, it’s a complete sham.”\r\n\r\n“Talk of this place in comparison with Blomidon!” said Arthur. “Why,\r\nit’s sacrilege. This place is only a thicket.”\r\n\r\n“What nonsense to call it a mountain!” said Tom. “I don’t believe it’s\r\nover a couple of hundred feet or so. I know it’s ten times harder to go\r\nup Blomidon.”\r\n\r\n“Aspotogon’s a humbug,” said Phil. “What do they mean by saying it’s the\r\nhighest land in Nova Scotia? It’s the most ridiculous nonsense I ever\r\nheard in my life. Besides, as to Blomidon--why, the view from that\r\nis the finest in America. And what is there here? A parcel of scrubby\r\ntrees!”\r\n\r\nSuch being the sentiments of the climbers, it is no wonder that they did\r\nnot linger long on the summit. There was nothing to keep them there; so\r\nthey soon descended. The way down, however, was even worse than the way\r\nup, especially when they reached the loose stones. For here the stones\r\nslid from under their feet at every step, and it was almost impossible\r\nto stand upright. Tom and Phil both went down, and a score of big stones\r\nrolled about them, and over them, bruising and scratching them; while\r\nbefore them a whole cartload of cobble stones and granite boulders went\r\nbounding down towards the cove. The boys tried it a little way, and then\r\ntook to the trees, where they completed the descent.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the knoll once more, they all felt tired and hot. Phil\r\nproposed a bath, and the proposal was most agreeable to all. In a few\r\nmoments their clothes were off and they were all in the water.\r\n\r\nThe water was pleasantly warm. They had not had a bathe for some time,\r\nand here it seemed the perfection of bathing. There was no surf; the\r\nwater was as smooth as glass, and gave the quiet of a lake with the salt\r\nwater of the sea. Phil was the best swimmer of them all, and struck out\r\nboldly to cross the cove. The others followed. On reaching the middle,\r\nPhil turned off in another direction, to a point on the shore where he\r\nsaw a curious rock that looked like a cave.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” he cried, “there’s a cave; let’s go and see it.”\r\n\r\nHe swam on, and the others followed. They soon reached the place, and\r\nclimbed up over the rough rock, to see what they supposed to be the\r\ncave. To their disappointment, it was not a cave at all, but only a\r\nslight recess of no depth in particular.\r\n\r\n“I thought we might find some traces of the buccaneers,” said Phil, in a\r\ntone of vexation. “We’re not in luck to-day.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, we are,” said Tom, cheerfully. “The discovery of that mound is\r\na good deal.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but then there’s that public road,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“O, we’ll work it yet. Only wait till we get our tent up.”\r\n\r\nOnce more the boys plunged in the water, and played, and sported, and\r\ndived, and floated, and swam this way and that way; now on their backs,\r\nand again in their natural positions. At length they began to feel\r\ntired, and directed their course towards the shore.\r\n\r\nTom was last, swimming along leisurely enough, and thinking about\r\nthe mound and its hidden treasure,--as were all the other boys,--when\r\nsuddenly he became aware of a movement in the water behind him, as of\r\nsome living thing swimming. It was not any of the boys. They were all\r\nahead; and it could not be Turnbull. It was not a man at all.\r\n\r\nIn an instant a terrible thought came to him, that sent a pang of\r\ndreadful anguish through his inmost soul.\r\n\r\nA shark!\r\n\r\nThat was the thought that flashed into Tom’s mind.\r\n\r\nHastily and fearfully he turned his head, dreading the worst. One glance\r\nwas enough. That glance froze his very life-blood with utter horror.\r\n\r\nThere, not more than six or eight yards away, he saw a black muzzle on\r\nthe surface of the water, pointing straight towards himself,--a muzzle\r\nnarrow, and black, and horrible. Tom had never seen a shark; but he\r\nhad read of them, and had seen pictures of them. One look was enough\r\nto convince him that this was a shark, who had scented them from afar,\r\nperhaps from the outer sea, and was now about to seize his prey.\r\n\r\nHis brain whirled, and all the scene for an instant swam before his\r\neyes. A half dozen yards! Could he hope to escape? Impossible! Yet, out\r\nof utter despair, there came to him the strength of a giant. He struck\r\nout with frantic and frenzied vehemence, shouting and screaming to the\r\nother boys,--\r\n\r\n“A shark! a shark! a sha-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!!!”\r\n\r\nThe other boys heard his yells. They looked around and saw all--the\r\nghastly face and staring eyes of Tom, with the horror of his expression,\r\nand beyond--the black muzzle. At that sight, there seized them all\r\na terror equal to that of Tom. In any other position they would have\r\nsprung to his help. But what help was possible here?\r\n\r\nNone. They were naked. They were unarmed. They were in the water.\r\nHelpless thus, and despairing, there was nothing which any one of\r\nthem could do, but to swim blindly on. It was an instinct of\r\nself-preservation that animated them all. They fled as they would have\r\nfled from an earthquake, or a roaring torrent--blindly--in frantic\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\nNot one word more was uttered. Not a sound was heard except the plashing\r\nnoise of their movements through the water, and the heavy pantings of\r\nthe exhausted swimmers. Still, though exhausted, not one of them dared\r\nto slacken his efforts. Not one of them dared to look around. In Tom’s\r\nmind there was the chilling horror of the monster behind, and a curdling\r\ndread of that moment when he would be seized. In the minds of the others\r\nthere was an equal horror of expectation, as they listened to hear the\r\nyell from Tom, which might announce that all was over.\r\n\r\nThus they hurried on.\r\n\r\nTom, in his anguish, thought of something that he had once read of\r\nabout sharks. He had read that the shark is cowardly, and is kept off\r\nby splashing in the water--at least for a time; just as a wild beast is\r\ndeterred by a fire, or a horse is scared by a log at the road-side. At\r\nthis thought he grasped. It was his only hope. As he swam, he plashed\r\nin the water, with all his force, with arms and legs, making it boil\r\nand foam all around him. This retarded his progress somewhat; but at\r\nany rate, it seemed to prolong his safety, for the monster did not seem\r\ninclined to draw nearer.\r\n\r\nThe moments passed on. They were not far from land,--yet, O, how far\r\nthat distance seemed to each despairing swimmer! Upon their distance\r\nwhat issues depended! O, that they had thought of the danger in time, or\r\nhad seen it a little while before!\r\n\r\nThe moments passed on--moments terrible, full of sickening anguish, of\r\nhorror intolerable! How long those moments seemed! To Tom each\r\nmoment was prolonged to the duration of an age, and an age of hideous\r\nexpectation--expectation of a doom so frightful, so abhorrent, that\r\nevery nerve tingled, and every fibre of his body quivered. And there,\r\nthrough the noise of the splashings made by his own efforts, he could\r\nplainly distinguish the movements of the monster behind. It did not seem\r\nnearer, but it was near enough to seize him at any moment. Why did the\r\nmonster delay? Was it his splashings which deterred it? Tom hoped so,\r\nand thrust the water aside with greater energy.\r\n\r\nAnd now he could hear the movement of the monster a little towards his\r\nright. It seemed to him that his pursuer was about to close with him,\r\nto attack him from another quarter. He remembered reading somewhere\r\nthat sharks swim around their prey before seizing it. This movement, he\r\nthought, was for that purpose. Every moment he expected to see the dread\r\nform of that pursuer appearing between him and Phil, who was nearest.\r\nBut he dared not look to assure himself. There was too much horror in\r\nthe awful sight. He dared not turn his head to look behind; he dared not\r\nturn his eyes even to one side. He could only keep them fixed, with a\r\nwide stare, upon vacancy, straight before him.\r\n\r\nThe moments passed on,--the awful moments, each of which threatens\r\ndeath, when the delay of the impending doom fills the soul with awful\r\nsuspense; still the monster hesitated to seize his prey. Still Tom’s\r\nears rang with the noise of his pursuer. Still the other boys, as though\r\ntheir tongues were frozen into silence, hurried to the shore. Still they\r\nwaited, expecting every instant to hear the terrible shriek which should\r\nannounce the awful doom of Tom. But the doom was still delayed, and\r\nstill Tom waited, and still the others listened. So they all hastened,\r\ntill each one’s heart seemed almost ready to burst, through the frenzied\r\nenergy of his efforts, and the intensity of his emotions. And there,\r\nbehind them all,--a little on Tom’s right,--the black muzzle advanced\r\nover the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nIn that desperate struggle, when they made such frantic efforts to reach\r\nthe shore, Bruce happened to be first. The shore to which they were\r\nswimming was that which happened to be nearest; not the grassy knoll\r\nbefore mentioned, but a beach covered with gravel, which was intermixed\r\nwith larger stones. Bushes grew close down to this beach, and beyond\r\nthese was that road which had so disgusted the boys.\r\n\r\nAt this place Bruce first arrived. His feet touched bottom. No sooner\r\ndid he feel the solid ground under his feet, than all his panic left\r\nhim, all his courage returned, and his presence of mind. Tom’s expected\r\ndeath-yell had not yet burst upon his ear; not yet had his shriek\r\nannounced the grasp of the monster. There might yet be time to save.\r\nIn an instant he had thought of what he should do. Plunging through\r\nthe water, and bounding forward, he soon reached the beach; and then,\r\nstooping down, he hastily gathered several large stones. Then he turned,\r\nand rushing back a few steps, stood with uplifted arm, taking aim,\r\nand preparing to hurl these stones at the monster. At that very moment\r\nArthur reached the place, and turned to look back, standing close by\r\nBruce. Phil was now only a few yards away, swimming in, with horror yet\r\nstamped upon his face. Beyond him was Tom, swimming, kicking, plunging,\r\nrolling, dashing the water in all directions, and making as much\r\ncommotion as would have satisfied an ordinary whale. As Tom thus swam\r\non, his despairing glance caught sight of the forms of Bruce and Arthur.\r\nThere they stood, up to their waists in water--Bruce with uplifted arm,\r\nholding an enormous stone, which he was about to throw--while in his\r\nother hand were several more stones. Arthur stood by his side.\r\n\r\nTom devoured them with his eyes; and he struggled on, wondering, yet\r\nscarcely daring to hope--wondering whether the stone which Bruce was\r\npreparing to throw would drive back the monster. To him it seemed that\r\nBruce was delaying for an unaccountable time. Why did he stand idle,\r\nwhen every moment was so precious? Why did he delay to throw? Why did he\r\nnot do something? Why did he stand there as if rooted to the spot, doing\r\nnothing? Was there some new horror? Were the monster’s jaws already\r\nopened to seize his prey?\r\n\r\nTom would have cried to Bruce to throw, but he could not speak. Not a\r\nsound could he utter. The thought came to him that Bruce was afraid to\r\nthrow, for fear that the stone might strike him instead of the shark.\r\nWhat matter? Far better to throw, and run the risk. This he would have\r\nsaid, but he could not in that paralysis of horror.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a frown came over Bruce’s face--which frown as suddenly faded\r\naway, and was succeeded by a blank look, accompanied by an indescribable\r\nexpression. The same changes passed over Arthur’s face. Tom saw it all,\r\nin his despair, and was bewildered. What was this? Were they deserting\r\nhim? Would they give him up? Impossible!\r\n\r\nYet it seemed as if they would. For suddenly Bruce’s uplifted arm\r\ndescended, and the stones all dropped into the water. The blank look\r\nupon his face was succeeded by one of astonishment, which faded away\r\ninto various expressions, which successively indicated all the varying\r\nshades of vexation, shame, and sheepishness. Arthur’s face was equally\r\neloquent. Had not Tom’s feelings so pre-occupied him, he might have\r\nfound a study in those two faces; but as it was, he was not in a\r\nposition to think of such a thing; for these looks and gestures only\r\nserved to inspire him with greater alarm.\r\n\r\n“They can do nothing,” he thought; and the thought brought to his soul a\r\nbitterness as of death.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Phil’s feet touched bottom. He rushed up to Bruce and\r\nArthur, and turned, as they had turned, to look back.\r\n\r\nAnd at the same moment the abhorrent sight appeared to Tom--of the\r\nblack muzzle shooting through the water close by his right shoulder.\r\nInvoluntarily he shrunk aside, with the thought that his last hour had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n_A Roar of Laughter from Bruce.--End of this tremendous\r\nAdventure.--Reticence of the whole Party on the Subject.--No one can\r\ntaunt the other.--Departure from the Haunt of the Buccaneers.--The\r\nAntelope expands her white Wings, but in vain.--The Precautions of the\r\nvenerable Corbet against dead Calms.--All labor at the Sweeps.--The\r\nSolace of Toil.--What Vessel are you gliding in?--Taking to the\r\nBoat.--Tumbling into Bed._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUDDENLY a roar of laughter burst from Bruce.\r\n\r\n“It’s a dog! It’s a dog!” he cried.--“Tom’s shark’s turned out to be a\r\ndog!”\r\n\r\nAnd saying this, he burst into another roar of laughter. The laughter\r\nproved contagious. Arthur and Phil both joined in. Their recent horror\r\nhad been so great, that this sudden and unexpected turn affected them in\r\na comical way, and the reaction was in proportion to their former panic\r\nfear. So their laughter was loud, boisterous, and unrestrained.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment when this cry had burst forth from Bruce, together\r\nwith the peals of laughter, Tom had shrunk back in horror from the black\r\nmuzzle that appeared on his right. But as he did so, and at the very\r\nmoment of this horror in which his eyes were fixed on the monster, this\r\nmonster became plainly revealed, and he saw it as it was.\r\n\r\nHe saw, what Bruce and the others now saw--a dog! a dog whose long,\r\nsharp muzzle and forehead were above the water, as also part of his back\r\nand his tail. He was a hound of some kind. Where he had come from, or\r\nwhere he was going to, or why he had appeared among them, they were, of\r\ncourse, unable to conjecture. Their whole recent terror had thus been\r\nthe result of pure fancy in Tom’s case, and in the case of the others\r\nthe result of Tom’s first shriek of alarm. In the case of all of them,\r\nhowever, the whole trouble was owing to the belief, of which they\r\nwere not yet able to divest themselves, that this cove was some very\r\nsequestered spot. So convinced had they been of this, that even the\r\nsight of a public road had not altogether disabused them. They had been\r\ndetermined to find here the haunt of the buccaneers, and were\r\nunwilling to think that it might be a common resort, or even a regular\r\nthoroughfare. And therefore, when Torn had first caught sight of this\r\nblack muzzle appearing above the surface of the water, he had been\r\nincapable of thinking about anything except a shark; and the horror that\r\nthis thought created within him had been communicated to the others by\r\nhis cries. Tom was the real cause of the whole mistake, and no one felt\r\nthis more keenly than Tom himself; yet the others were all too much\r\nashamed of their own recent terrors to twit or taunt him with his\r\nunfounded alarm.\r\n\r\nThe dog now swam alongside of Tom, and a little ahead of him, turning\r\nonce or twice, and showing his face--not the cruel face of a monster of\r\nthe deep, but the mild, humane, civilized, and benevolent countenance\r\nof a hound of the highest respectability; a face the sight of which made\r\nTom feel renewed shame at his foolish and baseless fears.\r\n\r\nThe other boys walked up to the beach, and Tom soon joined them. The\r\nhound joined them also. He was a very friendly dog, and shook himself\r\nso violently that they all received a shower-bath from him. They patted\r\nhim, and petted him, and stroked him; and these friendly advances of\r\ntheirs were received in the politest possible manner by the well-bred\r\nhound, who finally planted himself on his haunches in the attitude known\r\nto dogs as “begging,” which so affected the boys, that they would\r\nhave given him some biscuit if their coats had not unfortunately been\r\nelsewhere. But the dog had evidently his own business to attend to, for\r\nafter a short delay he took his leave, and trotted up the road. This\r\nsudden and unexpected turn which had been given to what had, at one\r\ntime, seemed like the most terrible of tragedies, rapidly restored their\r\nstrength and spirits, in spite of the tremendous sensations which they\r\nhad but recently experienced, and the exertions which they had put\r\nforth. They now prepared to return to the place where they had left\r\ntheir clothes; and since the fear of sharks had departed, they took\r\nto the water again, and soon reached the knoll. Here they clothed\r\nthemselves, and prepared to return to the schooner.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Antelope, they were all sensible of the most extreme\r\nfatigue and prostration. The exertions which they had made in the ascent\r\nand descent of Aspotogon, and more especially in their efforts to escape\r\nthe imaginary shark, were the cause of this in part; but a greater cause\r\nexisted in the intense excitement and terror to which they had been\r\nsubject. They were fortunate, however, in having such a place of refuge\r\nas the hold of the Antelope, for there they found awaiting them a\r\ndinner, prepared by Solomon, in which that famous cook had surpassed\r\nhimself, and had turned out the rarest specimens of the culinary art.\r\nTheir exertions had sharpened their appetites, and the long time that\r\nhad elapsed since breakfast made this dinner seem like a banquet. It\r\nacted upon them all like a charm. Their physical natures were refreshed,\r\nand their moral natures also.\r\n\r\nStrength came to their bodies, and at the same time to their minds.\r\n\r\nThe affair of the shark was not mentioned. Under other circumstances,\r\nBruce, and Arthur, and Phil might have taunted Tom with his absurd\r\nmistake; but as it was, they were all too much ashamed of their own\r\nfears, and of their own part in the affair. The consequence was, that\r\nall, with one consent, allowed the matter to drop, and made no reference\r\nto it whatever.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they went upon deck, and found all sail set, and the\r\nAntelope on her way back to Chester. But there was no wind whatever; it\r\nwas a dead calm, and consequently the return to Chester was not likely\r\nto be accomplished very speedily. There was, from time to time, a faint\r\npuff of wind, it is true, which served, perhaps, to prevent the calm\r\nfrom being so dead as it might have been; yet, after all, their motion\r\nwas so slight, and their progress so slow, that after two hours they had\r\nnot put much more than a mile between themselves and the shore.\r\n\r\nIt was about four o’clock when they returned from Deep Cove to the\r\nAntelope. By six o’clock they had not made more than this one mile. The\r\nboys were now anxious to get back to Chester for various reasons. First,\r\nthey wanted to have a good night’s rest at the inn. Secondly, they\r\nwanted to see the landlord, and ask him all about Deep Cove. Thirdly,\r\nthey wanted to see Bart and Pat, and tell them about their wonderful\r\ndiscovery of the “Mound,” and their theory about the buried treasure.\r\nBut the failure of the wind made it seem impossible for them to get back\r\nto Chester that night, and there was some talk of anchoring. To this,\r\nhowever, the boys would not listen, and they urged Captain Corbet to\r\nkeep on and take advantage of any slight puffs of wind that might arise\r\nfrom time to time. Against this request Captain Corbet had no objections\r\nto offer, and so it was that the Antelope still moved on.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope therefore still held her sails expanded to catch any breath\r\nof wind that might arise, while the boys lounged along the taffrail,\r\nlooking impatiently around. At another time they would not have failed\r\nto admire the beauty of the scene--the blue sea washing the long line of\r\nshore, and surrounding the numerous isles; but on the present occasion,\r\nthey were too impatient and too tired to be affected by it. Time thus\r\npassed, and at length the sun went down in the western sky in a blaze\r\nof glory. By that time the boys found themselves approaching an island,\r\nwhich was about three miles from Aspotogon, and which thus indicated to\r\nthem the distance which they had gone since leaving Deep Cove. Less than\r\nthree miles in four hours had been their rate of progress.\r\n\r\nThe sun thus set, and the moon had now come out, throwing a gentler glow\r\nupon the scene, and lighting it up with wonderful beauty. The edges\r\nof the hills, and the outlines of the islands seemed all tipped with\r\nsilver. On one side appeared Aspotogon, and Ironbound, and Tancook,\r\nrising out of the dark, shadowy water; while on the other side the\r\nislands shone in the lustre of the moon, and there, too, a broad pathway\r\nof radiant light lay outspread upon the surface of the water, reaching\r\nfrom the schooner to the horizon, where a low coast bounded the scene.\r\nNever had Ma-hone Bay appeared clothed in greater loveliness.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet had learned a very useful lesson during this last voyage\r\nof the Antelope, and that was to have some means on board by which\r\nhe would not drift so helplessly. The long drifts which had borne him\r\nhither and thither over the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and over the ocean,\r\nhad left a deep impression; and accordingly he had taken advantage of\r\nthis visit to Chester to procure a pair of long sweeps, which may be\r\ndescribed as oars of the largest size. On the present occasion, the\r\nsweeps were brought into requisition, one of them being worked by\r\nTurnbull, Bruce, and Phil, while the other was taken in hand by Wade,\r\nArthur, and Tom. The venerable Corbet stood at the helm and steered,\r\nwhile Solomon stood at the bows, gazing pensively into space, and, as\r\nTom declared, attitudinizing for a figure-head.\r\n\r\nThe sweeps were moved with very long, slow strokes. The two parties who\r\nmanaged them at first made an effort to work them in time, but at length\r\ngave this up, and each made their stroke at random, without reference to\r\nthe others. Whether the Antelope made any progress or not, was not for\r\na long time perceptible; but still the boys all felt as though they were\r\ndoing something, and the lapse of time certainly seemed to bring them\r\nnearer to the island which they had been so long approaching.\r\n\r\nThe exercise was a pleasant one, and in order to cheer their spirits,\r\nthey burst forth into songs. One was volunteered by Tom.\r\n\r\n                   What vessel are you gliding in?\r\n\r\n                        Pray tell to me its name;\r\n\r\n                   Our vessel is the Antelope,\r\n\r\n                        And Corbet is my name,\r\n\r\n                        And Corbet is my name,\r\n\r\n                        And Corbet is my name;\r\n\r\n                   Our vessel is the Antelope,\r\n\r\n                        And Corbet is my name.\r\n\r\nAt this Captain Corbet’s venerable face was all suffused with sudden\r\nsmiles.\r\n\r\n“Why railly.” said he, “railly now, dew tell. Why, ef you ain’t ben an\r\ndone it agin. Only think, more rimes about me. Why, it doos beat\r\nall. How upon airth dew you ever manage to fix em up that way? It\r\ndoos--beat--my--grandmother!”\r\n\r\nOther songs followed, till almost everything was made use of that they\r\nhad ever heard--the Canadian Boat Song, the Maltese Boat Song, and\r\nothers of a kindred character, including “Hail to the Chief,” and\r\n“March! March! Ettrick, and Teviotdale.” In this way the time was\r\nbeguiled, and their toil at the long sweeps lightened.\r\n\r\nAround them the whole scene glowed in the moonlight. The silver islands\r\nset in silver seas, clothed in soft lustre, lay reflected in the smooth\r\nwater. Overhead the moon hung in a cloudless sky, and lightened up all\r\nthings with its soft and mellow radiance. They could see also by the\r\nchange in their position, which they noticed from time to time, that\r\nthey were actually making some progress with their sweeps, and the\r\ndiscovery, when it was made, encouraged them not a little.\r\n\r\nSo at it they all went again, more vigorously than ever, and sang new\r\nsongs, some of which were of a kind never before heard in these waters.\r\nOne in particular, which was sung to a remarkable fugue tune, was called\r\nOde to Disappointment.\r\n\r\n                   I never had a piece of bread\r\n\r\n                   Particularly wide,\r\n\r\n                   Partic-kik-kik-kik-kik-cu-lar-ly wide,\r\n\r\n                   But fell upon the dusty floor,\r\n\r\n                   All on the buttered side.\r\n\r\n                   All on the but--\r\n\r\n                   All on the but--\r\n\r\n                   All on the but--\r\n\r\n                   All on the but--\r\n\r\n                   All on the but-tut-tut-tut-tut-tut-tered side.\r\n\r\n                   And always thus, from childhood’s hour,\r\n\r\n                   This luck on me has fell.\r\n\r\n                   This luck-kuk-kuk-kuk-kuk on me has fell.\r\n\r\n                   There always comes a soaking shower,\r\n\r\n                   When I’ve no umberell,\r\n\r\n                   When I’ve no umb--\r\n\r\n                   When I’ve no umb--\r\n\r\n                   When I’ve no umb--\r\n\r\n                   When I’ve no umb--\r\n\r\n                   When I’ve no umb-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-\r\n\r\n                        bum-be-rell!\r\n\r\nThis spirited ode was the arrangement of Phil, who prided himself hugely\r\nupon it. He did not claim it as original, but as having been “arranged”\r\n and “adapted” to its present tune.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Bruce at length, “I dare say we are making some\r\nprogress; but it strikes me that it hardly pays.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Tom. “At this rate it’ll take us till to-morrow morning to\r\nmake another mile.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t object to rowing all night,” said Phil, “but I do object to row\r\nwithout getting the benefit of it.”\r\n\r\n“I move,” said Arthur, “that we vote the sweeps a humbug.”\r\n\r\n“I second that motion,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Bruce, “it’s being moved and seconded, that the sweeps\r\nare a humbug. Those of that mind will please manifest it by saying Ay.”\r\n\r\n“Ay!” rang forth from Arthur, Tom, and Phil.\r\n\r\n“Contrary minds, Nay.”\r\n\r\nNo response.\r\n\r\n“It’s a vote,” said Bruce. “And now, gentlemen, we may as well consider\r\nwhat’s to be done next.”\r\n\r\n“O, well,” said Phil, as he and the other boys left the sweeps which\r\nTurnbull and Wade, however, still kept working. “I suppose there’s\r\nnothing left to do but to turn in.”\r\n\r\n“It can’t be helped,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to make the best of it,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“I say, boys,” said Bruce, “why can’t we take the boat and row to\r\nChester?”\r\n\r\n“A good idea,” cried Arthur. “Capital. I only wish we’d done it before.”\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Tom, “we’re going to take the boat.”\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t you better wait a little,” said the anxious Corbet, who was\r\nevidently not pleased with the proposal.\r\n\r\n“O there’s no use; we want to get to Chester to-night. You’ll get along\r\nbefore morning. How many miles is it from here?” he asked, turning to\r\nTurnbull.\r\n\r\n“Four,” said that taciturn individual.\r\n\r\n“Four miles. Well, boys, what do you say?”\r\n\r\n“I’m agreed,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Anything’s better than this,” said Phil; “so I agree to the boat.”\r\n\r\nWith this agreement they all turned to the boat, and got in. A few brief\r\ndirections were given by Turnbull, and the boys pulled away. First Bruce\r\nand Arthur pulled, then Tom and Phil. Taking turns in this way, they\r\nhad the satisfaction of seeing themselves making good progress, and at\r\nlength reached the wharf at Chester.\r\n\r\nIt was about three o’clock in the morning. They knocked up the people at\r\nthe inn, and hurried up to their rooms. They were so utterly worn out,\r\nand so sleepy, that they did not think of asking about Bart and Pat, but\r\ntumbled into bed, and in a few moments were all sound asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n_Bart and Pat.--Terrible Situation. ‘--The first Horror, and its\r\nEffects.--An Attempt to climb.--Another Attempt to scale the\r\nCorners.--Trying the Sides.--Too wide by far.--Pat wants to tie a\r\nRope to Nothing.--The Pickaxe.--New Attempts at Climbing.--New\r\nDisappointments.--Pat’s Fertility of Invention.--A new Suggestion.--A\r\ndangerous Experiment.--Running the Risk.--Tugging at the Logs.--The\r\nobstinate Fabric.--Baffled and beaten._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE, side by side, stood the two boys, at the bottom of the deep pit,\r\ninto which they had descended; and, standing there, they looked with\r\nunutterable feelings at the opening far above them, across which\r\nwas suspended the treacherous beam. At first there was a thrill of\r\nexpectation, in both of them, that the beam was even then breaking, and\r\nat any instant might fall and crush them. It had sagged down so far, and\r\nthe fracture was so complete, that the end might come in another moment.\r\nThus they stood, and looked up in silence, and with hearts that throbbed\r\nfast and painfully. Neither of them spoke a word. It was as much as they\r\ncould do to breathe.\r\n\r\nA terrible position it was, and how terrible they knew only too well.\r\nOne hundred feet below the ground, and seventy feet below the level of\r\nthe sea--such was the depth of that pit. It was so long and so narrow\r\nthat the bottom was quite dark. As they stood with their eyes thus fixed\r\non the threatening beam, they noticed that the sky beyond it had changed\r\nin its color from blue to black, and two or three stars were faintly\r\nvisible. It was like the sky of night, and not like that of day. That\r\nlittle piece of sky thus indicated to them the change in their fate, and\r\nseemed to frown upon them from above.\r\n\r\nIn their minds there was one prevailing sense of mute horror and awful\r\nexpectation; yet, together with this, a thousand other thoughts flashed\r\nthrough them--thoughts of friends, thoughts of home, wild speculations\r\nas to the possibility of escape; and with these they noticed also that\r\nblack piece of sky, with its faintly-twinkling stars. But between them\r\nand it, between the upper world which that sky spoke of and themselves,\r\nthere intervened that broken beam stretching across like a bar, to shut\r\nthem in forever.\r\n\r\nNow, gradually, the first horror passed. It was too intense a feeling\r\nto endure. The delay of their fate made them calmer, and brought back\r\npresence of mind; for the beam moved no more--it fell not--perhaps it\r\nmight remain as it was, threatening them, but doing no more than that.\r\nThis respite from their doom thus brought them back to themselves, and\r\nmade them search eagerly the sides of the pit as they looked up.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if we can’t climb it, thin,” said Pat.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid not,” said Bart, in a dejected tone.\r\n\r\n“Sure an there’s no harrum in given it a thrial,” said Pat; and, as he\r\nsaid so, he laid his hands upon the staying around the hole. Scarce\r\nhad he done this, than he was aware of a difference between the staying\r\nhere, and that which was higher up. Bart, also, who had done as Pat had\r\ndone, and tried to find some way of climbing, noticed the same thing.\r\n\r\nHad the staying below been like that above, the question of their escape\r\nwould very soon have been settled by such practised climbers as these\r\ntwo; but, unfortunately, there was a very important difference. Above,\r\nthe staying had been made of stout planks and deals, and these were far\r\nenough apart to have served for grasping by both hands and feet. They\r\nwould thus have afforded an actual ladder. Below, however, it was very\r\ndifferent. The staying of the sides of the pit was made, not of planks,\r\nwhich could be grasped by the hands, but of round logs, which the hands\r\ncould not hold, though the feet could insert themselves well enough in\r\nthe interstices. These logs rested closely one upon the other, nor was\r\nthere any way by which the hands could pass between them or around them\r\nso as to grasp them. This, then, was the discovery that Bart and Pat\r\nmade the moment that they tried their hands at climbing; and thus\r\nthe first plan of escape which had suggested itself was baffled most\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n“If we only had the planks!” sighed Bart: “but these round logs give no\r\nchance.”\r\n\r\nPat made no reply.\r\n\r\nBart then tried to climb at the corner, for here there would be more\r\nadvantage to the feet, since the sides, being at right angles, would\r\nafford an easier foothold. But, though it was easier for the feet, it\r\ngave no greater help to the hands than before. Still, there were the\r\nround logs; nor was there at the angle formed by the sides any spaces\r\nsufficient to receive the hand and afford a hold.\r\n\r\n“If we cud only get up as far as the rope,” said Pat, “it might give us\r\na help, so it might.”\r\n\r\n“What! when that beam is hanging there? Why, if you touched that rope\r\nthe beam would come down.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an I forgot that for the moment, so I did,” said Pat, dejectedly.\r\n\r\n“Strange we didn’t notice that the beam was rotten,” said Bart,\r\nmournfully. “It looked sound enough.”\r\n\r\n“It looked as sound as a nut, so it did; and how it managed to howld on\r\ntill I jarked it bates me intirely, so it does.”\r\n\r\n“It must have been sagging down and cracking all the time. The only\r\nwonder is, that it didn’t give way when we were higher up. If it had,\r\nthere’d have been an end of us.”\r\n\r\n“Sure ‘n you niver spoke a truer word in your life, so you didn’t; an,\r\nbe the same token, it’s a good sign, so it is, an a fine thing intirely,\r\nthat we’re down here now at this blissid minute, wid our bones not broke\r\nto smithereens. Sure but it makes me fairly shiver whin I think of you\r\nan me, one after the other, hangin away up there from that bit of rotten\r\nstick that was broken all the time.”\r\n\r\n“If this wasn’t quite so wide,” Said Bart, “we might stretch our legs\r\nacross, and get up that way. I’ve seen men go down into wells as easy as\r\nyou please, just by stretching their legs across.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an meself it is that’s seen that same,” said Pat, briskly; “an I\r\nwondher whether, afther all, our legs mightn’t be long enough to do it.”\r\n\r\n“O, no,” said Bart; “it’s too wide altogether.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an we might then; an there’s nothin like tryin.”\r\n\r\nWith these words Pat set himself to try, and Bart did the same. They\r\ntried by stretching their legs as far as possible on each side to secure\r\na foothold, and thus ascend. Had the pit been narrower, or had their\r\nlegs been longer, they could have done it; but, as it was, they found it\r\nquite impossible. They could, indeed, touch the beams on either side\r\nif they stretched their legs as far apart as possible; but, having\r\naccomplished this, they could do no more. They could not raise their\r\nfeet higher to the log above. So rigid were their legs when thus spread\r\napart, that they could not raise them. At length they were compelled to\r\ndesist from these efforts.\r\n\r\n“It’s too wide intirely, so it is,” said Pat, dolefully. “An whativer\r\nwas the use of makin the hole so wide is beyond me. It wasn’t any use at\r\nall at all, so it wasn’t; an there you have it.”\r\n\r\n“The fault’s in our legs as much as in the pit,” said Bart. “If we were\r\nfive years older we might do it.”\r\n\r\n“Sure I always thought I cud climb betther thin any man till this\r\nblissid momint,” said Pat.\r\n\r\n“I only wish I was a man for about five minutes,” said Bart, fervently.\r\n\r\n“Two minutes’d jist do it, so it wad,” said Pat. “Yes,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“An these logs don’t go all the way up. If we cud only get up to the\r\nplanks we’d be all right.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t notice particularly,” said Bart, “but it seems to me that the\r\nplank staying reaches nearly half way down.”\r\n\r\n“Full that, ivery inch of it, so it does,” said Pat. “If we could only\r\nget up as far as that!” exclaimed Bart.\r\n\r\n“Faith, I have it,” said Pat, suddenly. “What?” asked Bart, with some\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n“I have it,” repeated Pat. “It’s a rope we want.”\r\n\r\n“A rope!” exclaimed Bart.\r\n\r\n“Yis, a bit of a rope; ony we haven’t got one long enough.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what good would a rope be to us here?” asked Bart, in a puzzle to\r\nknow what in the world Pat had got into his head.\r\n\r\n“Sure, I have it. Can’t we twist a rope an make this longer?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you’re after,” said Bart, impatiently. “What do you\r\nmean?”\r\n\r\n“Sure an we can tear up our coats an shirts, an make a rope that\r\nway; ony,” he added, thoughtfully, “it mightn’t be long enough, so it\r\nmightn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” said Bart; “you’re crazy. What do we want of a rope?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, to climb with.”\r\n\r\n“How? Where would you fasten it?”\r\n\r\n“Fasten it, is it?” said Pat, in a dubious tone; “sure that same I\r\nniver thought of at all at all. I forgot all about it, so I did.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ll have to do something,” said Bart. “We can’t stand still\r\nhere and die.”\r\n\r\n“There’s the bit of a pick here,” said Pat. “Sure an we ought to be able\r\nto do somethin with the pick, so we ought.”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words he stooped and lifted up the pickaxe which he\r\nhad thrown in before they went down, and which, in the anguish and\r\nexcitement which they had thus far felt, had been altogether forgotten.\r\n\r\n“We ought to do something with that,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“It won’t do any good to more thin one of us,”. said Pat, sadly, “for\r\nonly one of us can use it at a time.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” said Bart; “if one of us can only climb up, can’t he help\r\nthe other?”\r\n\r\n“Sure an so he can,” said Pat; “an I niver thought of that, so I\r\ndidn’t.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if we can climb with that?” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Sure an we can try,” said Pat; “an we ought to do somethin, so we\r\nought.”\r\n\r\nWith these words, he thrust the pick between two timbers, a few feet\r\nabove his head, and then clutching it, he raised himself up to a level\r\nwith the pick, in the easiest way possible. Hanging there for a moment,\r\nwith his hands grasping the pick, and his feet stuck tight between the\r\nlogs, he tried to raise himself higher. To do this, it was necessary to\r\nhold himself there, while removing the pick, and raising it to the logs\r\nfarther up. But here was the fatal and insuperable difficulty; and this\r\nbrought them exactly back to where they were before. Do what he would,\r\nhis hands could not grasp the round logs with sufficient firmness to\r\nmaintain a hold. After a few efforts he gave it up, and jumped down.\r\n\r\nBart then tried, making his attempt at the corner of the pit, where the\r\nangle of the two sides favored him more. Striking the pick in between\r\ntwo logs, as high up as he could reach, he raised himself up as Pat had\r\ndone, and then tried to lift himself higher. He found a place which he\r\ncould grasp, and clinging to this with a convulsive effort, he raised\r\nthe pick to the logs farther up, and succeeded in thrusting it into a\r\nnew place. Then he drew himself up higher, and once more searched about\r\nfor a place to grasp. But now no place could be found. In vain he tried\r\nto thrust his fingers between the logs; in vain he sought to grasp the\r\nround surface. It was a thing that could not be done. After a long\r\nbut fruitless effort, Bart was compelled to give up. Yet he was not\r\nsatisfied. He tried the other three corners of the pit in succession.\r\nIn all of them his efforts met with the same result--failure, utter and\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nAt length he flung down the pick, and stood panting.\r\n\r\n“Deed, thin, an I’m glad to see you back, so I am,” said Pat.\r\n\r\n“Glad!” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Yis, glad I am; that same’s what I mane. I’d rather have you fail down\r\nhere, than half way up. You niver cud go all the way; an if you had to\r\nturrun back when half way up, it’s a sore head I’d have watchin you; an\r\nyou cud niver expict to git back here again without broken bones.”\r\n\r\n“If we only had one other pickaxe,” said Bart, “I could do it.”\r\n\r\n“Of coorse you cud; an if we had dizens of other things, you cud do it,\r\nso you cud, an so cud I; but there’s the throuble, an that’s what we’ve\r\ngot to contind against, so it is.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to do something,” said Bart, gloomily and desperately.\r\n\r\n“Sure an that’s thrue for you, so it is, an you niver spoke a thruer\r\nword in yer life, so you didn’t,” said Pat; “an be the same token, it’s\r\nwith this pick, so it is, that we’ve got to work,--for it’s the only\r\nthing we’ve got at all at all.”\r\n\r\n“What can we do,” said Bart, in the same gloomy tone, “if we can’t\r\nclimb?”\r\n\r\n“Sure an there’s lots more, so there is,” said Pat, who on this occasion\r\nshowed a wonderful fertility of invention. “I’ve ben a thinkin,” he\r\nadded, “that we might dig away these logs with the pick.”\r\n\r\n“What good would that do?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“Sure an we might dig thim out one by one, an pile thim up as we dug\r\nthim, an so we might make a pile of logs high enough to reach to the\r\ntop.” Bart was silent for a few moments. The suggestion was certainly of\r\nsome value.\r\n\r\n“I wonder whether we mightn’t shake that log down on us, by pounding\r\naway down here?”\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s the only thing,” said Pat. “We’ve got to run some risk,\r\nof coorse; an I don’t think that our blows would be felt so high up.\r\nBesides, we needn’t sthrike very hard.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, “it’s the only thing we can do.”\r\n\r\nUpon this, Pat inserted the point of the pick between the logs near\r\nhim, and tried to pry the lower one out at one end. But the stubborn log\r\nresisted his efforts. It had been too firmly fixed in its place to\r\nyield to such a slight force as that which he could bring. Bart lent his\r\nefforts, and the two exerted themselves with their utmost strength, but\r\naltogether in vain.\r\n\r\n“If we cud ony git out one log,” said Pat, “it wud be aisy workin out\r\nthe others, so it wud; but this one seems a tough customer, so it does.”\r\n\r\n“There ought to be some log about here,” said Bart, “weaker than\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an that’s thrue for you,” said Pat, “an so we’ll jist thry thim\r\nall one afther another, ivery one of them. We’ve got lots of time, so we\r\nhave.”\r\n\r\n“See, here’s a smaller one,” said Bart.\r\n\r\nPat struck the point of the pick where Bart pointed, and once more the\r\ntwo boys exerted themselves to pry out the log. But though this one was\r\nsomewhat smaller than the other, it was quite as firmly fixed, and the\r\nutmost efforts of both of them failed to move it, even in the slightest\r\ndegree, from its bed.\r\n\r\n“Sure an there’s no danger of this pit iver cavin in,” said Pat, as he\r\ndesisted from his efforts. “They made this pit strong enough to howld a\r\niliphant, so they did--the worse for us.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, “we’ll have to try every log that’s within reach.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an we ought to find some weak spot if we do, so we ought,” said\r\nPat.\r\n\r\nBart now inserted the pick between the logs just above the last one.\r\n\r\n“This is jist what we intinded to do whin we come down,” said Pat; “for\r\nweren’t we goin to thry to git to the money-hole?”\r\n\r\nBart said nothing.\r\n\r\nThe two boys now tugged away as before. But the result was the same, for\r\nthis log was as firmly fixed, as tough, and as obdurate as the others.\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s hard, so it is, that the very log we trusted our lives\r\nto should turrun out to be rotten, an all these logs here should be as\r\nsound an as strong as steel an iron, ivery mother’s son of thim. If we\r\ncud only find a rotten one, an pull it out of its place, we’d be able to\r\ngit at the others aisy, and haul out all the rist of thim.”\r\n\r\nThe boys now tried other logs, one after the other; but from all of\r\nthem they met with the very same stubborn resistance. They had all\r\nbeen placed here evidently by men who worked comscientiously, and were\r\ndetermined to leave no weak spot exposed to the pressure of the earth.\r\nAnd, as was natural, that which had withstood so well the pressure of\r\nthe surrounding soil, was easily able to withstand the puny efforts of a\r\ncouple of boys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n_Pat and the Pick.--A dangerous Plan.--Undermining the very\r\nFoundation.--A terrible Risk.--Something like an Earthquake.--A Way\r\nopened.--They make an Ascent.--A sudden Stop.--The projecting\r\nLog.--The Pickaxe.--Who shall go down?--A new Descent.--The Watch\r\nof Bart.--Alarm.--A Call.--Silence.--Terror.--An Answer.--Fearful\r\nIntelligence.--The very worst.--The Drain.--The rising Waters.--The Pit\r\nflooded.--The impending Doom._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN this way they went over all the logs, and at length reached the\r\nlowest layer of all. At this point, Pat’s superior dexterity with the\r\npick enabled him to invent and to put in practice a plan which could not\r\nhave been used before, or with any of the logs except these lowest ones.\r\nFor beneath these was the earth, and Pat’s plan was the natural and\r\nsimple one of digging this earth away, and so undermining the log that\r\nlay there. Pat worked nimbly and thoroughly, and as he loosened the\r\nsoil, Bart scraped it away with his hands. Pat dug down to the depth\r\nof a foot all along, and then thrust the pick far in, scooping out the\r\nearth that lay on the other side of the log. In this way they succeeded\r\nin removing the earth that kept the log in its place, and at length they\r\nwere able to detach it, and draw it forth.\r\n\r\nThe removal of this one log served to make the removal of the others\r\npossible. By diligent efforts the four logs which composed the lower\r\ntier were detached. The side logs were too long for the pit, and\r\ntherefore had to be placed erect, and leaned against the side. The\r\nend logs could lie down easily. The second tier then followed, and was\r\nremoved more easily than the first. Then the third tier was detached,\r\nand the fourth. In each case the logs of the side had to be stood erect,\r\nwhile the end logs were laid on the ground at the bottom.\r\n\r\nA serious difficulty now appeared before the boys, and one, too, for\r\nwhich they had not been prepared. The length of the side logs was a\r\nvery embarrassing circumstance. They were too long to be placed at the\r\nbottom, and had to be stood up. But this took up space, and infringed\r\nvery seriously upon the narrow area in which their operations were\r\ncarried on. In passing from one side to remove the logs on the other,\r\nthey had to lift these backward and forward so as to get them out of\r\nthe way--a work which was most exhaustive, and at the same time hindered\r\nthem in their proper efforts. Still they kept on, until at length about\r\neight tiers of logs had been removed, and the longer ones filled up\r\nso much space, that it was quite impossible to do any more. They still\r\nworked away at those which were within reach, and managed to remove a\r\ndozen logs more; but after this they could do nothing, for the bottom\r\nof the pit was completely filled, and the staying was now a compact mass\r\nfrom which nothing further could be detached until the logs were removed\r\nwhich were covered up by those piled against it.\r\n\r\nBart and Pat were now compelled to desist for a time, and as they\r\nfelt quite exhausted, they raised themselves to the top of the pile of\r\nupright logs, and there sat down. Scarcely had they done this, when they\r\nwere aware of a trembling all around, like an earthquake. In horror they\r\nsprang to their feet. The sides seemed to be moving; the logs separated,\r\nand descended, and through the crevices there protruded sand and clay.\r\nIt was as though the whole mass of the casing was falling in. In an\r\ninstant they knew what it was. In their thoughtlessness they had taken\r\naway the foundations of this structure, and it was all falling in.\r\nAn involuntary cry of terror burst from both. They shrank together,\r\nclinging to the pile on which they stood, and awaited their last hour.\r\n\r\nBut once again there was a respite. The movement ceased. The worst\r\nseemed to be over, at least for the present. Yet the result of this\r\none movement was fearful as far as it went. All the logs of the casing\r\nseemed severed and distorted, and had apparently descended as far as\r\nthey had dug away the foundations. Seeing this, another frightful\r\nthought came--the broken beam above. They looked up fearfully. As yet,\r\nhowever, the danger impending hesitated to strike, for there, across the\r\nmouth of the hole, they saw the broken beam defined against the sky.\r\nIt did not appear to have moved; nor was there that appearance of\r\nirregularity about the upper casing of the pit which now marked the\r\nlower. It seemed to them as though the slighter staying of plank had\r\nbeen put in the upper part of the pit, because it was clay, and needed\r\nbut little protection; but down below, where the soil was looser, stout\r\nlogs had been required. As they looked up, they saw that all this lower\r\ncasing of logs had fallen.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had they discovered this than they saw also something which\r\ninspired them with hope. Not only had the lower staying of logs thus\r\ndescended, but it had also lost its cohesion, and the logs all seemed\r\nto be separated by spaces of more or less width, while many of them\r\nprotruded into the pit as though thrust in by the pressure of the earth.\r\nNow they recognized at a glance the tremendous risk that they had run\r\nwhile removing the lowest logs; but at the same glance they perceived\r\nthat the immediate danger had passed, and that they were now at least\r\nless helpless than before. For now, at last, there need be no difficulty\r\nabout climbing. Now the spaces between the logs were wide enough for\r\nthem to find something which they might grasp with their hands, and for\r\nsome distance up, at any rate, they could see what seemed like a ladder,\r\nup which they might climb in search of escape from this fearful place.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had they made this discovery than they at once caught at this\r\nprospect which thus had so unexpectedly opened before them, and began\r\nto climb. The task was not very difficult. Each one took a corner of the\r\npit where the meeting of the two walls favored the ascent, and for some\r\ntime they continued to mount without much difficulty.\r\n\r\n“Sure but I’m afraid this is too good to last,” said Pat.\r\n\r\nBart made no reply. That very fear was in his own mind. In that suspense\r\nhe could say nothing. At last they had mounted as high as the\r\nplace where the rope had broken. The end hung here suspended most\r\ntantalizingly. O, what joy it would have been for them had it been the\r\nrope alone which had thus broken,--if the beam had only continued sound;\r\nbut now that rope was useless, and they dared not touch it for fear lest\r\neven a touch might bring down upon their heads the beam that hung there\r\nimpending over them. Fortunately they were able to ascend yet higher,\r\nfor still above them the log casing had been started asunder, and still\r\nthey found themselves able to grasp places of support. The staying had\r\ncertainly undergone a universal disintegration, and nothing but its\r\ngreat compactness had prevented it from falling in ruin over their\r\nheads, and burying them alive. It was with amazement and consternation\r\nthat they recognized their work, and these feelings would have\r\noverwhelmed them had they not found the result, after all, so fortunate\r\nfor themselves. The risk had passed away. For the present, at least,\r\nthey were receiving the benefit.\r\n\r\nThe fear which Pat had expressed, and which Bart had felt without\r\nexpressing, that the ascent was too good a thing to last, was at length\r\nproved to be only too well founded. After they had climbed some distance\r\nfarther, they found their ascent brought to an abrupt termination. For\r\nhere there was a kind of separation between the lower casing and the\r\nupper; a log bulged forward about a foot, and above this there was a gap\r\nin the casing about two feet in height which shoved the earth behind,\r\na kind of clay, and in this there was a cavity caused by the falling of\r\nthe casing. Above this the casing had held firm, but unfortunately they\r\nhad not reached the planks. They were the same round logs which rose\r\nabove them, and which would be as difficult to scale from this point as\r\nthey had proved from below.\r\n\r\nUpon this ledge, formed by the bulging logs, they clambered, and seated\r\nthemselves, dejected at the termination of their ascent, yet relieved\r\nslightly by the chance which was now afforded of some rest and breathing\r\nspace. Here they sat, and looked up.\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s hard, so it is,” said Pat, “to find an ind to it just\r\nhere, whin, if we’d only been able to climb twinty or thirty feet\r\nfurther, we’d have got to the planks, an been all safe.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart, looking up, “there are the planks; and they’re not\r\nmore than thirty feet above us at the farthest.”\r\n\r\n“An yit they’re as much out of our raich as though they were a hundred,\r\nso they are.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather have the thirty feet, at any rate,” said Bart. “Come now;\r\ncan’t we manage to get farther up.”\r\n\r\n“Nivir a farther,” said Pat. “We’ve got to the ind of our journey.”\r\n\r\n“Come now,” said Bart. “See here, Pat. You spoke of a tunnel once. In\r\nfact we came down here with the pickaxe on purpose to make a tunnel\r\nto the money-hole. Well, we’re after something more precious than\r\nmoney--life itself. Can’t we tunnel up to life?”\r\n\r\n“Tunnel, is it?” cried Pat, in great excitement. “Of coorse we can.\r\nYe’ve jist hit it, so you have. It’s what we’ll do. We will thin.”\r\n\r\n“The soil here seems like clay; and if we cut up behind this casing,\r\nit’ll be comparatively safe,” said Bart. “We need only cut up to the\r\nplanks.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an we’ll have to cut up to the top.”\r\n\r\n“O, no! When we get to the planks, we can break through, and climb them\r\nlike a ladder to the top. Once up to the planks, and we’re safe.”\r\n\r\n“Break through the plankin is it? Sure enough; right are you; that’s\r\nwhat we’ll do, so it is.”\r\n\r\n“And so that makes only thirty feet to cut away. It’ll be hard work\r\ncutting upwards; but you and I ought to manage it, Pat, when our lives\r\nare at stake.”\r\n\r\n“Manage it? Of coorse; why not? Only we haven’t got that bit of a pick\r\nwith us, so we haven’t, for we left it down below; an sorra one of\r\nme knows what’s become of it. It may be buried under the roons of the\r\nfallin logs.”\r\n\r\nAt this Bart looked at Pat with something like consternation.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he at length, “we’ll have to go down again--one of us; we\r\nmust have that pickaxe. I’ll go.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an you won’t,” said Pat; “meself’s the one that’s goin to go.”\r\n\r\n“No, you shan’t. Poh! Don’t be absurd.”\r\n\r\n“Sure I’m bound to go; and so don’t you go too. There’s not the laste\r\nnicissity in life for both of us to go.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, then,” said Bart, “we’ll have to toss up for it. That’s all.”\r\n\r\nAnd saying this, he took out a piece of money, and said to Pat,--\r\n\r\n“Head or Tail?”\r\n\r\n“Tail.” said Pat.\r\n\r\nBart tossed. Pat lost. It was Pat’s business therefore to go down.\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s aisy climbin,” said Pat, “an the pick’ll be a help whin I\r\nreturn.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he departed.\r\n\r\nSeated on the log, Bart looked down, watching Pat’s descent. They had\r\nclimbed about half way up the pit, and Pat had about fifty feet to go\r\ndown. Looking down, it was dark, and Pat at length disappeared from\r\nview. Bart could only hear him as he moved about. At length there was a\r\ndeep stillness. Bart grew alarmed.\r\n\r\n“Pat!” he called.\r\n\r\nNo answer came. “Pat!” he called again.\r\n\r\nStill no answer.\r\n\r\n“Pat!” he called, as loud as he could, for he was now thoroughly\r\nfrightened. As he called, he put his feet over, and prepared to descend.\r\n\r\n“I’m here,” Pat’s voice came up. “Don’t come down. I’m coming up.”\r\n\r\nThese words filled Bart with a feeling of immense relief. He now heard\r\nPat moving again, and at length saw him ascending. Nearer he came, and\r\nnearer. But Bart noticed that he did not have the pickaxe. He feared\r\nby this that it had been buried beneath the fallen logs. If so, their\r\nsituation was as desperate as ever. But he said not a word.\r\n\r\nPat at length reached the place where Bart was, and flung himself down,\r\npanting heavily. Bart watched him in silence.\r\n\r\n“The pickaxe is buried,” said he at length, “I suppose.7’\r\n\r\n“Worse,” said Pat, with something like a groan.\r\n\r\n“Worse?” repeated Bart in dismay.\r\n\r\n“Yis, worse,” said Pat. “The water’s comin in. There’s six feet of it,\r\nan more too. The hole’s flooded, an fillin up.”\r\n\r\nAt this awful intelligence Bart sat petrified with horror, and said not\r\none word.\r\n\r\n“It’s the diggin away at the casin,” said Pat, dolefully, “an the cuttin\r\naway of the earth, that’s done the business, so it is. I can onderstand\r\nit all easy enough. Sure this pit’s close by the money-hole, an the\r\nbottom of it’s close by the drain that they towld us of. An them that\r\nmade this hole didn’t dare to go one inch further. An that’s the very\r\nthing, so it is, that we’ve done. We’ve cut, and dug, and broke through\r\ninto the drain. What’s worse, all the casin an all the earth’s broke\r\nand fallen down. An there’s no knowin the mischief we’ve done. Any how,\r\nwe’ve broke through to the “drain”--bad luck to it; and the water’s jist\r\nnow a powerin in fast enough. Sure it’s got to the top of them logs that\r\nwe stood upon end--the long ones; and they’re more’n six feet long, an\r\nit’s risin ivery minit, so it is, an it’s comin up, an it’ll soon be\r\nup to this place, so it will. An sure it’s lost an done for we are\r\nintirely, an there you have it.”\r\n\r\nAfter this dreadful intelligence, not a word was spoken for a long time.\r\nPat had said his say, and had nothing to add to it. Bart had heard it,\r\nand had nothing to say. He was dumb. They were helpless. They could go\r\nno farther. Here they were on this log, half way up the pit, but unable\r\nto ascend any further, and with the prospect before them of swift and\r\ninevitable destruction.\r\n\r\nThey had worked long and diligently. Not one mouthful had they eaten\r\nsince morning; but in their deep anxiety, they had felt no hunger. They\r\nhad labored as those only can labor who are struggling for life. And\r\nthis was the end. But all this time they had not been conscious of the\r\npassage of the hours; yet those hours had been flying by none the less.\r\nTime had been passing during their long labor at the logs below--how\r\nmuch time they had never suspected.\r\n\r\nThe first indication which they had of this lapse of time was the\r\ndiscovery which they now made of a gradually increasing gloom. At first\r\nthey attributed this to the gathering of clouds over the sky above; but\r\nafter a time the gloom increased to an extent which made itself apparent\r\neven to their despairing minds. And what was it? Could it be twilight?\r\nCould it be evening? Was it possible that the day had passed away? Long\r\nindeed had the time seemed; yet, even in spite of this, they felt an\r\nadditional shock at this discovery. Yet it was true. It was evening. The\r\nday was done. They two had passed the day in this pit. This was night\r\nthat was now coming swiftly on.\r\n\r\nThey remained motionless and silent. Nothing could be done; and the\r\nthoughts of each were too deep for utterance. Words were useless now.\r\nIn the mind of each there was an awful expectation of a doom that was\r\ncoming upon them--inevitable, swift, terrible! They could only await it\r\nin dumb despair.\r\n\r\nNight was coming, adding by its darkness to the horror of their\r\nsituation. Death in daylight is bad enough, but in the dark how much\r\nworse! And the fate that threatened them appeared wherever they might\r\nturn their eyes--above, in the shape of that broken beam which yet in\r\nthe twilight appeared defined in a shadowy form against the dim sky;\r\naround, in this treacherous casing, which, being undermined, might at\r\nany moment fall, like the lower portion, and crush them; beneath, most\r\nawfully, and most surely, are those dark, stealthy, secret waters\r\nwhich had come in from the “drain” upon them as though to punish their\r\nrashness, and make them pay for it with their lives. In the midst of all\r\nthese fears they remembered the superstitious words of the man whom they\r\nhad questioned, “Flesh and blood will never lay hands on that treasure,\r\nunless there’s a sacrifice made--the sacrifice of human life!” Such was\r\nthe declaration of the man on the shore, and this declaration now made\r\nitself remembered. The sacrifice of life. What life? Was it theirs? Were\r\nthey, then, the destined victims? Awful thought! Yet how else could it\r\nbe? Yes, that declaration was a prophecy, and that prophecy was being\r\nfulfilled in them. But O, how hard it was to die thus! so young! in\r\nsuch a way! to die when no friends were near! and where their fate would\r\nnever, never be known to those friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n_Waking from a sound Sleep.--The Missing Ones.--An earnest\r\nDebate.--Various Theories.--Fishing versus Sailing.--Afloat or\r\nAshore.--Emotion of the venerable Corbet.--His solemn Declaration.--The\r\nAntelope or the Whaler.--Stick to the Antelope.--A new Arrival.--The\r\nLandlord’s View of the Case.--New Doubts and Perplexities.--“Afloat\r\nor Ashore” again.--The Landlord’s View of the Sailing Theory, and his\r\nDecision in Favor of the Fishing Hypothesis.--The Lost Ones must be\r\ncamping out for the Night._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE boys at the inn slept soundly, and did not wake until after their\r\nusual time. On going down to breakfast, they looked about for Bart and\r\nPat. At first they thought that their two friends had already taken\r\ntheir breakfast, and gone out; but an incidental remark of the landlady\r\nmade known to them the fact that they had not been back to the inn at\r\nall. This intelligence they received with serious faces, and looks of\r\nsurprise and uneasiness.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what can be the meaning of it,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“It’s queer,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“They were very mysterious about going, in the first place,” said Tom.\r\n“I don’t see what sense there was in making such a secret about it. They\r\nmust have gone some distance.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they didn’t think we’d be back so soon,” said Phil, “and have\r\nplanned their own affair, whatever it is, to last as long as ours.”\r\n\r\n“O, they must have known,” said Bruce, “that we’d be back to-day.\r\nAspotogon is only a few miles. In fact we ought to have been back\r\nyesterday, in time for tea, by rights.”\r\n\r\n“Where in the world could they have gone to?” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“O, fishing, of course,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“But they ought to have been back last night.”\r\n\r\n“O, they’ve found some first-rate sport.”\r\n\r\n“After all,” said Phil, “there wasn’t any actual reason for them to come\r\nback. None of us are in any hurry.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but they may have got into some scrape,” said Bruce. “Such a thing\r\nis not inconceivable. It strikes me that several members of this party\r\nhave already got into scrapes now and then; and so I’m rather inclined\r\nto think that the turn has come round to Bart and Pat.”\r\n\r\n“What I’m inclined to think,” said Arthur, “is, that they’ve gone off in\r\na boat for a sail before breakfast, and have come to grief somehow.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if they tried a sail-boat, they were pretty sure of that,” said\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Phil; “neither Bart nor Pat know anything more about sailing\r\na boat than a cow does.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Bruce, “they can’t have fallen into any very serious\r\ndanger.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“There hasn’t been any wind worth speaking of.”\r\n\r\n“Neither there has.”\r\n\r\n“But there was some wind yesterday morning,” said Arthur. “It carried us\r\nto Aspotogon very well.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! Such a wind as that wouldn’t do anything. A child might have\r\nsailed a boat.”\r\n\r\n“O, I don’t know. That wind might have caught them off some island, and\r\ncapsized them.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe that wind could have capsized even a paper boat,” said\r\nPhil; “but still I’m inclined to think, after all, that they’ve met with\r\nsome sort of an accident in a boat.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it,” said Tom. “They couldn’t meet with any kind of\r\naccident. My opinion is, that they went off fishing, kept at it all\r\nday, got too far away to think of coming back last night, and so very\r\nnaturally put up at some farm-house, where they have by this time eaten\r\na good, rattling breakfast, and are on their way back, walking like the\r\nvery mischief.”\r\n\r\n“The most natural thing in the world too,” said Bruce. “I quite agree\r\nwith Tom. It’s just what any other two of us fellows would have done.\r\nIn the first place, they backed out of the Aspotogon expedition very\r\nquietly, so as not to make a fuss, then they went off’, and, as Tom\r\nsays, got too far to come back; though whether they’ve had such a\r\ntremendous adventure as ours at Deep Cove with the shark is a matter\r\nthat has yet to be decided.” This first allusion to the shark was\r\nreceived by all the party with a solemn smile.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Arthur, “I believe they’ve taken to a boat. Perhaps they’ve\r\ngone cruising about.”\r\n\r\n“But they couldn’t have been capsized.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then how do you account for their absence?”\r\n\r\n“Easily enough,” said Phil. “I believe they’ve gone visiting some of\r\nthe islands, and somehow they’ve lost their sail, or their oars, or else\r\nthey’ve been careless about fastening the boat, and she’s drifted away.\r\nAnd so I dare say that at this very moment they are on some desert\r\nisland in this bay, within a mile or so of this town, looking out for\r\nhelp; but if they are, they must be pretty hungry by this time, for it\r\nisn’t every island that can furnish such a bill of fare as Ile Haute\r\ngave to Tom.”\r\n\r\n“A perfectly natural explanation,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Those two fellows are both so abominably careless, that, if they did go\r\nashore on any island, they’d be almost certain to leave the boat loose\r\non the beach, to float away wherever it liked. I believe, as Phil says,\r\nthat they’re on some island not far away.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t,” said Bruce. “I believe that they went fishing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what are we to do about it? Oughtn’t we to hunt them up?” said\r\nPhil.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see the use,” said Tom. “They’ll be along by dinner time.”\r\n\r\n“Well, for my part,” said Arthur, “I can’t sit here and leave them to\r\ntheir fate. I believe they are in a fix, and consequently I intend to go\r\noff to hunt them up.”\r\n\r\n“So will I,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Well, of course, if you go, I’ll go too,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“So will I,” said Tom; “though I don’t believe there’s the slightest\r\nnecessity. Bart and Pat’ll turn up somewhere about noon, and find us\r\ngone. They’ll then go off in search of us. Well, it’ll amount to the\r\nsame thing in the end, and so, perhaps, it’s the best way there can be\r\nof filling up the time.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if the Antelope’s got back,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose we go down and talk it over with Captain Corbet.”\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\nWith these words the boys rose from the breakfast table, and went down\r\nto the wharf. As they approached they saw the Antelope lying there at\r\nher former berth; for she had arrived about an hour before, and had come\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n“Wal, boys,” said he, as he saw them, “here we air once more, jined\r\ntogether as before; though whether you did well in a desertin of the\r\nship in mid-ocean is a pint that I don’t intend to decide. You might\r\nas well have turned into your old quarters aboard, an slep calm an\r\ncomfortable, instead of rowin six or eight mile by night. However, you\r\ndon’t none o’ you look any the wuss for it, an so we’ll let bygones be\r\nbygones. Ony I’m pleased, likewise relieved, to see you here, instead of\r\nhavin to larn that you’re among the missin, an probably roamin the seas\r\nin a open boat. An where, may I ask, air Bart and Pat?”\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question plunged the good Corbet from the comfort\r\nin which he had settled himself, down into the depths of anxiety and\r\nworriment.\r\n\r\n“What! Not back yit?” he said. “You don’t say so. Is this railly so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What! all yesterday, an all last night?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“An no word of partin--and no directions as to where they went, an when\r\nthey’d return?”\r\n\r\n“Not a word.”\r\n\r\n“An nobody seen them go?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“An nobody’s seen anythin of them at all?”\r\n\r\n“No, nothing.”\r\n\r\n“An you don’t even know whether they’re in danger or safety?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Nor even whether they’re on land or water?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head slowly and sadly, and turned away with\r\nthe profoundest dejection and melancholy depicted upon his venerable yet\r\nexpressive features.\r\n\r\n“Tom and I think they’ve gone off fishing,” continued Bruce, who had\r\ntold the tale of woe; “but Arthur and Phil are afraid that they’ve gone\r\noff in a boat, and have met with some accident. They’re determined to\r\ngo off to hunt them up, and we’ve concluded to go too, as we don’t care\r\nabout staying behind doing nothing; though, at the same time, we don’t\r\nbelieve they’ve come to any harm, and we think they’ll be coming after\r\nus. We thought we’d let you know; and perhaps we’d better put off in the\r\nAntelope, unless you think a small boat would be better.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes,” said Arthur, “let’s go in a small boat. The Antelope won’t do.\r\nThere’ll be another calm, and we’ll have to stand still and do nothing.”\r\n\r\n“We could get one of these whalers,” said Phil, pointing to a number of\r\nboats at the wharf.\r\n\r\nThese boats were sharp at each end, and were therefore called “whalers”\r\n on account of their shape, and not because they were ever used, or ever\r\nintended to be used, against whales. They were large and capacious, and\r\nwell ballasted; while, at the same time, they were not too large to be\r\nrowed, in case of calms or head winds.\r\n\r\n“O, bother the whalers,” said Tom’; “let’s stick to the Antelope,\r\nwhatever we do. Whenever we leave the Antelope, we’re sure to come to\r\ngrief. Besides, I don’t like to have to stuff myself into a little\r\nopen boat. I like to move about, and walk up and down, and change my\r\nposition.”\r\n\r\n“So do I, for that matter,” said Phil; “but then, you know, we may be\r\ncaught in a calm, as we were last night.”\r\n\r\n“O, there’s lots of wind now.”\r\n\r\n“But it mightn’t last.”\r\n\r\n“Then, if it don’t, we can take to the boat.”\r\n\r\n“What, our little row-boat?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; why not?”\r\n\r\n“Why, we can’t go any distance in her; she’s too small.”\r\n\r\n“O, let’s get a whaler,” said Arthur, “and then we’ll be ready for wind\r\nor calm.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bruce, “if I thought that Bart and Pat were really out\r\nanywhere in the bay, I’d say, take a whaler; but as I consider this\r\nexpedition a wild-goose chase, I go in for comfort, and vote for the\r\nAntelope.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we won’t do anything; that’s all; and if they are in danger,\r\nwe’ll be sorry for it.”\r\n\r\n“O, I’ll run the risk.”\r\n\r\n“We’re a tie,” said Phil. “Let’s give Captain Corbet the casting vote.\r\nCome, captain, what do you say about it? Do you think they’re on land or\r\nwater? and do you advise a whaler or the Antelope?”\r\n\r\n“Me?” said Captain Corbet, mournfully. “Me? Wal, for my part, I’ve come\r\nto believe the wrust. I believe them two air at this moment on some lone\r\nrock of the deep, gazin in despair upon the waste of water, and lookin\r\nwildly in all directions for help. And so it ever hath been, and ever\r\nshall be. Amen. For my part, I’m free to say, that I never see, nor\r\nnever hear tell of, nor never even dreamt of the likes of you. If you\r\nget out of my sight for one moment, you’re sure to be engaged in reskin\r\nyour lives about nothin. An I’ll give up. If Providence restores them\r\ntwo, I hereby declar solemn, that it’s my fixed intention to start right\r\nstraight off for hum; never to stop at one single place, nor even to\r\ngo near any land, till I touch the wharf at Grand Pré. What this\r\nhere’s goin to end in beats me; and this last business doos beat my\r\ngrandmother. As for you, I advise you to stick to the Antelope, and sail\r\nunder the old flag. Them’s my sentiments.”\r\n\r\nThis advice of Captain Corbet was accepted as his decision, and so it\r\nwas resolved to set off in the Antelope, and cruise round the bay. Such\r\na search was, of course, not very promising; but Arthur and Phil had\r\na vague idea that in the course of the cruise they would see the two\r\nmissing ones making signals of distress from some lonely island,\r\nand that thus they might be rescued. As for Captain Corbet, he still\r\nremained melancholy, though not at all despairing; for though he\r\ninsisted that the boys were in some danger, he yet believed that they\r\nwould be rescued from it.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this conversation, they were interrupted by the\r\nappearance of the landlord. He had just returned from that journey up\r\nthe country, which had prevented him from accompanying them to Aspotogon\r\non the previous day. He had learned at the inn the state of affairs, and\r\nhad at once come down to the wharf. The boys, on the other hand, knowing\r\nthat he had been up the country, thought it possible that he might have\r\nseen or heard something of their missing friends; and therefore, no\r\nsooner had he made his appearance, than they all hurried to meet him,\r\nand poured upon him a whole torrent of questions.\r\n\r\nThe landlord’s answer was a complete defeat of all their hopes. He had\r\nseen nothing of Bart and Pat, and had heard nothing of them. He had\r\nknown nothing of their departure, and nothing of their absence, until a\r\nfew moments before, on his arrival home. He himself had to question them\r\nto find out the facts of the case.\r\n\r\nOf the facts of the case, however, they themselves were, unfortunately,\r\nquite ignorant. They had nothing to communicate but fancies,\r\nconjectures, and speculations, more or less plausible, such as they\r\nhad just been discussing. To these the landlord listened with the\r\nprofoundest attention and the deepest gravity, and then considered them\r\nall in succession.\r\n\r\n“I can’t say,” said he, at length, “that I see any danger for them in\r\nany way. Praps they’ve gone in a boat, an praps they’ve gone fishing. If\r\nthey’ve gone in a boat, why, there hasn’t been wind enough to capsize a\r\nwalnut-shell. An as to getting on an island, I don’t see how their boat\r\ncould drift away, unless they made it go, and actually shoved it off on\r\npurpose. You must remember that this bay ain’t like the Bay of Fundy.\r\nThere ain’t any tides or currents here worth mentioning. The tide only\r\nrises and falls six or seven feet, and the currents are so trifling that\r\nthey ain’t worth considering. If these boys have got on an island and\r\nbeen left there, it’s a puzzle to me how on earth they managed it. Then,\r\nagain, there are boats and schooners passing backward and forward almost\r\nall the time, and if they had got ashore anywhere, they’d have been got\r\noff by this time. So it’s my opinion that they haven’t gone off in a\r\nboat, but that they’ve gone fishing. If they’ve gone fishing, it’s the\r\nmost likely thing in the world for them to go off a good bit, and not\r\nbe able to get back the same day. The only trouble about this is,--that\r\nthey wouldn’t be likely to go away on foot; and if they got a wagon,\r\nthey’d be most likely to take it from the hotel; but that’s just what\r\nthey haven’t done. So there’s a fresh puzzle on top of the others.”\r\n\r\n“O, I think they’d be just as likely to walk as not.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, there’s another puzzle. Where could they go? They never\r\nmade any inquiries. We had a long talk the night before last, but not\r\na word was said about fishing. If they’d been intending to go fishing,\r\nthey’d have asked; wouldn’t they? Of course they would. That stands to\r\nreason.”\r\n\r\n“O, I dare say they got up early, and a sudden notion took them, and\r\nthey started off without having any particular place in view.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s not unlikely,” said the landlord; “and if they did, why,\r\nall I’ve got to say is, they’d have a precious long walk of it, for\r\nthere isn’t any really decent fishing within less than nine or ten\r\nmiles; and so, if they walked that, and then went up stream, why, by\r\nthe time they’d finished, they’d have walked ten miles more; and so, all\r\ntogether, they’d make a precious good day’s work of it,--work enough,\r\nin fact, to make them rather indifferent about hurrying back\r\nhere--especially when they’d have to do it on foot.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose they’d find houses to stop at.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, there are houses enough; but it depends on what direction they\r\nwent. In some places, they’d have to camp out for the night.”\r\n\r\n“Well, they understand that well enough,” said Tom. “Bart and Pat can\r\nput up as neat a camp as any two fellows going.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n_A new Arrival.--The “longshore Man”.--A strange and startling\r\nTale.--Fears once more awakened.--The Stranger’s superstitious\r\nDread.--The Boat found, but the Boys gone.--The Landlord’s\r\nStatement.--Fears confirmed and increased.--Off to the Rescue.--Oak\r\nIsland.--The empty Boat.--Where are the Boys?--The flooded Pits.--No\r\nSigns of the Missing Ones.--The grisly Theory of Roach.--Kidd and his\r\nGang._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE remarks of the landlord served to weaken the belief of Arthur and\r\nPhil in their theory of the boat, and they began to doubt the expediency\r\nof setting off in the Antelope. The easy way also in which the landlord\r\nmet the difficulties of the case, and accounted for everything, had\r\na very great effect in diminishing, if not in destroying, the anxiety\r\nwhich they had begun to feel. They had nothing to offer in reply, and\r\nthey naturally gave up their proposal. They began to think that the\r\nabsentees might make their appearance at any moment, and that under the\r\ncircumstances it would be very unwise to start off on a long, uncertain,\r\nand unprofitable cruise in the Antelope. And thus it was that the whole\r\nparty came to the conclusion to remain where they were, and wait for\r\nBart and Pat.\r\n\r\nWith this intention they all went back to the inn. On arriving there,\r\nthey found a man who had just come to the house, and was waiting to find\r\nthe landlord. He looked like one of those half farmers, half fishers,\r\nwho live about Mahone Bay; and the boys would not have paid any\r\nattention to him, had they not been startled by his first words.\r\n\r\n“It’s about a couple o’ lads,” said he, “jest like them there. I’m\r\nafraid there’s somethin gone wrong with ‘em.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of “a couple o’ lads jest like them there,” all the\r\nboys started, and gathered round the stranger with eager and anxious\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n“Ye see,” continued the man, “it was yesterday morn’n,--an them two come\r\na knockin at my door about sunrise, or not much arter, and asked the way\r\nto Oak Island.”\r\n\r\n“Oak Island!” repeated the landlord, in a strange voice. The other boys\r\nnoticed his tone, but as they knew nothing whatever of the character of\r\nOak Island, they were of course unable to understand the cause of it, or\r\nthe meaning of those words.\r\n\r\n“It seems they was a huntin up the way there,” continued the man. “They\r\nhad a boat with them.”\r\n\r\n“A boat?” said the landlord; “a sail-boat, or row-boat?”\r\n\r\n“A sail-boat,” said the man. “They were strangers--that was evident: and\r\nthey wanted to find Oak Island. Wal, I showed them the island, for it\r\ncan be seen plain enough from my door. My name’s Roach, an I live on the\r\nshore up there. So we had some talk about the treasure, an they asked\r\nme if I believed. An I says, ‘Yes, I do.’ For at first they thought I\r\ndidn’t believe. But I did, an I do. And I says to them, says I, ‘Flesh\r\nan blood won’t never lay hands on that thar treasure till there’s a\r\nsacrifice of human life took place.’ That’s what I says, in so many\r\nwords. Wal, some more words followed, an then them two went on an\r\nsteered to the island.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I don’t know how it was, but I kep a thinkin about them two all\r\nday long. At last I fell a wonderin why they didn’t come back. There\r\nwasn’t no sign of any boat a comin back from that island. They was on\r\nit, I knowed; an why they staid on it I couldn’t make out. It began to\r\nbother me. An all the time I couldn’t help thinkin of what I told em,\r\nan the words kep a ringin in my ears as to how that there’s got to be a\r\nsacrifice of human life before the treasure’s riz out of the hole whar\r\nthe pirates buried it. An I couldn’t get them words out o’ my head. An\r\nwhat’s more, I got a thinkin that them two lads was kine o’ connected\r\nwith them words,--jest as if it was a sort o’ prophecy like, that I’d\r\ngone an spoke,--not knowin, an not intendin it, you know, but givin a\r\nprophecy all the same,--as is gen’rally the case, you know; for often it\r\nhappens that them that prophesies hain’t got no intention of so doin, an\r\nhain’t got no reel idee of the meanin of what they’re sayin. An that\r\nwas jest the case with me, an it was only afterwards that these thoughts\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n“Wal, all day long I was in this state, an felt dreadful anxious, an\r\nmore an more so as the day went by. It was yesterday. An I see no signs\r\nof that thar boat a comin back. An when evenin come I begun to feel\r\npooty skeart, an I’d a gone off then but darsn’t, for fear of the ghosts\r\nof them old pirates that prowl around on the island arter dark. I didn’t\r\nclose my eyes all last night, or sleep a wink, for thinkin o’ them two\r\nlads. It seemed to me that I’d been kine o’ to blame--though whar the\r\nblame was, no one can say, for I was as innocent of blame as a babe\r\nunborn. But so it was, an I couldn’t sleep. Wal, this morn’n I was up\r\nbefore dawn, an into my boat, an off for the island. I got thar about\r\nsunrise.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I landed thar, on Oak Island, an the fust thing I see was that\r\nthar identical boat that the boys had--the very one. I couldn’t mistake\r\nit; an it lay hauled up on the beach, an tied thar. But thar wasn’t any\r\nsign of any boys anywhars. I called, an shouted, but no answer come.\r\nWal, then I walked up some distance, an looked all around everywhars.\r\n’Tain’t much of an island in size; so I soon walked all round it; but\r\nI didn’t see nothin of them thar lads. I looked at one or two of them\r\npits that’s ben dug thar, but didn’t see anythin but water. I kep a\r\nscreamin an a shoutin all the time, but thar wasn’t any answer at all.\r\nThar was the boat on the beach,--but whar was the boys? I couldn’t see\r\nem, I couldn’t find em; and though I called for em, they didn’t answer.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I went back to the beach, an then I stood an tried to think what\r\nI’d best do. Somethin had happened. I knowed that the best thing to do\r\nwas to make haste an try to let the friends of them lads know how things\r\nwas. I knowed that they was strangers in these parts, an that they’d\r\ncome from Chester. I thought I’d find out about em here at the inn, an\r\nthat the best an quickest way would be to come right straight off to\r\nthis place, an see if I couldn’t larn somethin about em, or find some\r\nfriends o’ thairs that’d come with me back again, an find out, for sure\r\nan sartin, what it was that had happened. An what troubled me most all\r\nthe time, and troubles me now, is them very words that I said to em\r\nas to how that it was necessary that thar must be a sacrifice of human\r\nlife. For I’m kine o’ feared that it’s turned out true, an that them’s\r\nthe very ones that was destined to be that sacrifice. They’ve got into\r\nsome trouble, I know--but how it was I don’t know, an whether it was in\r\nthe day time, or at night. This is what I want to find out.”\r\n\r\n“What did the boys look like?” asked the landlord, as the man ceased.\r\n\r\n“Wal, jest sech lookin lads as these--not overly well dressed, in fact a\r\nleetle mite shabby; but one of them was a gentleman’s son,--no doubt o’\r\nthat; an the other was a bright-lookin lad enough.”\r\n\r\n“It’s Bart and Pat. There’s no doubt of that,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“And what sort of a boat was it?”\r\n\r\n“O, an ordinary Chester boat, with a sail, as I said.”\r\n\r\n“Is the boat on the beach of Oak Island yet?”\r\n\r\n“Course it is. I left it where it was. But air them thar boys a stoppin\r\nhere? Do you know them?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the landlord, in a husky voice; and he stood in silence for\r\na few moments, with his eyes cast down.\r\n\r\nUpon the boys this information had produced an effect which was at once\r\ndistressing and puzzling. It was distressing, from the fact that this\r\nstranger more than hinted at some possible evil befalling their\r\ntwo companions; and his gloomy allusions to his prophecy about the\r\n“sacrifice of human life,” together with the expression of his own\r\nanxiety, produced a corresponding effect upon all of them. But it was\r\nalso puzzling, for they could not imagine what there was on this Oak\r\nIsland to attract Bart and Pat; or, if there was any attraction in it,\r\nhow Bart and Pat had found it out. Various expressions made use of,\r\nhowever, such as his allusions to “pirates” and “treasure,” served\r\nto make them suspect that this Oak Island might be the very place, in\r\nsearch of which they had come to Chester, the place indicated by the\r\nstory of the governor of Sable Island; that somehow Bart and Pat\r\nhad made this discovery, and had remained behind, while they went\r\nto Aspotogon for the express purpose of finding out the place for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn this suspicion they were right, and it was confirmed by the landlord.\r\n\r\n“I see it,” he exclaimed, suddenly. “I have it.”\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Why, I know now why they didn’t go with you.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Why, because they wanted to go to Oak Island.”\r\n\r\n“Oak Island? But what is there in Oak Island?”\r\n\r\n“Enough to attract any one. I told them about it the evening of the day\r\nyou came--all about the pirates, and how Kidd buried his treasure there,\r\nand how it was found out, and the different attempts made to raise it.\r\nIt’s too long a story now. You can hear it some other time. But I told\r\nit to them, and they’ve gone wild with excitement to visit the island\r\nthemselves. That’s it. Yes, that’s it. But I didn’t think-they’d clear\r\nout this way. What made them do it? They made a great secret of it. What\r\nwas the use of that? And now what in the world has become of them?”\r\n\r\n“They went to that thar island,” said Roach, “an they’ve never left it.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure you went all over it?”\r\n\r\n“Sure? Of course.”\r\n\r\n“And the boat was on the beach?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; an it’s thar yet. An if them lads belong to this here party, then\r\nmy advice is, you’d better hurry off an find out what’s become o’ them.\r\nI’m dreadful anxious still, an want to know the wust. An I’m afeard that\r\nif we find out anything, it’ll be the very wust.”\r\n\r\nTo this disheartening remark there was no reply made. The boys all\r\nfelt the same. Arthur and Phil, who had at first felt anxious about\r\nthe absentees, now felt a worse anxiety; while Bruco and Tom, who had\r\nexplained away their absence, now knew not what to say or to think.\r\nAlthough the evident superstition of the man Roach lessened somewhat the\r\nvalue of his testimony, still they could not conceal from themselves the\r\nfact, that there were grave reasons for alarm,--such as the boat on the\r\nshore, and the failure of his cries to reach the ears of the boys. Where\r\ncould they be, that in a circuit of the island, this visitor had not\r\nbeen able to see them, or to make his cries heard? What could have\r\nhappened to them? What sort of dangers could have presented themselves?\r\nThe dangers which had been suggested by the superstitious fancy of Roach\r\nhad no terrors in their eyes, and no weight in their minds,--at least\r\nin broad day. But there might be other dangers, of a material kind, of\r\nwhich they knew nothing. What did he mean by those “pits” full of water?\r\nWhat pits? They could not guess at this, for they had not heard the\r\nlandlord’s story, and Oak Island was all an unknown ground to them.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the questions and the fears which were started by the\r\nanxiety of the boys; and the more they thought over these things, the\r\nmore that anxiety increased.\r\n\r\nBut one thing, of course, now remained to be done, and that was, to\r\nhasten, as fast as possible, to the place where Bart and Pat had gone,\r\nand search for themselves after their lost companions. The landlord at\r\nonce began his preparations. The Antelope was not to be thought of. By\r\ntaking her, time would be lost; for it was necessary to start from the\r\nback bay, which was very much nearer to Oak Island. Roach had landed\r\non that side, and his boat, a roomy whaler, was at their disposal. They\r\ntherefore at once decided to embark in her, and go by that way in search\r\nof the lost ones.\r\n\r\nThey set forth at once, the landlord accompanying them. It was not\r\nthought necessary to send word to Captain Corbet, as he would not be\r\nable to do anything, and might only embarrass their movements by an\r\nuntimely fussiness, or by an anxious determination to accompany them\r\nin Roach’s boat. A walk of a few minutes brought them to the back bay,\r\nwhere the boat was lying. It was soon afloat, and the party embarked.\r\nThen the sail was hoisted, and as the wind was fair and fresh, they\r\nmoved rapidly through the water, heading for Oak Island. On the way the\r\nlandlord informed them that he had told to Bart and Pat the story of Oak\r\nIsland, and gave them a kind of summary of the same story. From this the\r\nboys were able to understand why it was that their absent companions had\r\nnot accompanied them, though they were still at a loss to know why\r\nit was that they had made such a secret of their plan, and what their\r\npurpose had been in thus setting out by themselves. They could only\r\nconclude that Bart and Pat wished to have the whole glory of making\r\nsome discovery by themselves, with which they should astonish their\r\ncompanions; and if there was any hope left in their minds, it was that\r\nthey had purposely secreted themselves from Roach, so as not to be\r\ndisturbed in their investigations. And this hope, though it was a faint\r\none, served to sustain them to some extent.\r\n\r\nIn a short time they reached Oak Island, where they landed at the very\r\nplace which had been chosen by Bart and Pat for their landing. Here\r\nthe first thing that they noticed was the boat which their friends\r\nhad brought, and which lay as they had left it. It was with melancholy\r\nforebodings that they looked upon it, wondering what had been the fate\r\nof those who had brought it here. But there was no time to waste in\r\nuseless regrets or idle fears. There was a very serious business before\r\nthem--the search after their lost companions.\r\n\r\nThey went up from the beach upon the island just as Pat and Bart had\r\ngone, and noticed the same things. They came to the mound of bluish\r\nclay, and saw the pit close by filled with water. They examined this\r\nnarrowly, as though they feared to find their friends here. Then they\r\nwent on further. Another mound, marking the presence of another pit.\r\nThey now began to understand the full meaning of these “pits” to which\r\nRoach had alluded. It was with a feeling of great relief that they saw\r\nno signs here of their lost friends. From this they went on farther to a\r\nthird pit.\r\n\r\n“I can’t imagine,” said the landlord, “how any harm could have happened.\r\nTwo sensible boys like these couldn’t have fallen into any trouble\r\nhere. They wouldn’t feel inclined to jump into a flooded pit and drown\r\nthemselves. As to this pit, it is dry; and I don’t think they would go\r\ndown into it. Why should they? They wouldn’t jump down, for they were\r\nnot yet quite tired of life, and there’s nothing here to show that they\r\nlowered themselves down.”\r\n\r\nEach solemnly shook his head.\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t that,” said he; “’tain’t that. It’s the sperits--the ghosts\r\nof the old pirates, that allers haunts this island. No man dare live on\r\nit, except when they come in companies. One or two, men or boys, air at\r\ntheir mussy. ’Tain’t no or’nary uthly dume that’s come over them thar\r\nlads. It’s Kidd an his gang that’s ben an done for them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n_A Place of Peril.--The Descent of the Darkness.--Dreadful\r\nExpectation.--The Sound from the nether Abyss.--The rising\r\nWaters.--Higher and higher.--A Gleam of Hope.--The Beams\r\nintermixed.--Borne upward on the Waters.--The last Chance.--A final\r\nStruggle.--Pat up to the Surface.--Dropping a Line to a\r\nFriend.--The midnight Sky, and the moonlit Sea.--The lone Hut.--The\r\nExplorers.--Despondency.--A last Resort.--Sleepers awake.--Wild and\r\nfrantic Joy.--The Voice of the Landlord.--The Joint Stock Company, and\r\nthe Steam Engine._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE coming of darkness gave a new horror to those which already\r\nsurrounded Bart and Pat far down in the pit. This made them perceive how\r\nlong they had already been down, and threw a new difficulty in the\r\nway of escape. But that way of escape seemed already to be effectually\r\nclosed when Pat brought back his terrible intelligence from the bottom\r\nof the pit. They had formed a new plan, which had given them hope; but\r\nnow the only way of carrying out that plan into execution was snatched\r\nfrom them by the advance of the waters. There was nothing for them to\r\ndo. To climb up the log casing was impossible, and to dig through the\r\nclay was equally so without some strong, sharp instrument, like the\r\npickaxe.\r\n\r\nNothing was visible down below, and up above it grew steadily darker.\r\nWhether the water below was rising higher in the pit or not they were\r\nunable to find out from actual sight, but they had a full conviction\r\nthat it was steadily advancing higher and higher towards them, and that\r\nwith its advance it was also unsettling or sapping away altogether the\r\nsides of the pit. Awful were the moments, and terrible the forebodings.\r\nThe darkness intensified every fear, and made the actual dangers by\r\nwhich they were surrounded still more formidable.\r\n\r\nOverhead they could see the shadowy form of the broken beam still\r\nhanging, and still threatening to fall at any moment. The rope fastened\r\nto it had broken below the point where they were seated, and was within\r\nreach of their hands; but it was of no use. Had the beam above been\r\nstrong, they could have easily saved themselves in this way; but the\r\nbeam being broken, they dared not touch the rope. The terror of the\r\nbroken beam was, however, lost sight of in the presence of that greater\r\nterror advancing from below, minute by minute--the terror of that water\r\ninto whose mysterious sources they had penetrated; whose secret fountain\r\nthey had broken up, and which now, like some formidable monster too\r\nrashly challenged, was advancing step by step, in irresistible power,\r\nto take vengeance upon these reckless intruders. That soil beneath had\r\nshown its looseness by tumbling down in the removal of the lower logs;\r\nthe tenacious upper clay did not exist there; and it seemed to them that\r\nthe rising water, by permeating all the soil, might at any moment cause\r\nall the pit to fail together in one heap of undistinguishable ruin. In\r\nthat case, they would be overwhelmed beyond the possibility of escape,\r\nand snatched from the world to destruction, without leaving behind them\r\nthe faintest vestige, or the slightest token of their awful fate.\r\n\r\nAt such a moment nothing was said. Nothing could be said. They sat there\r\nthen in silence, listening with sharpened senses for any sound that\r\nmight tell of the approach of the water. For a long time, however, they\r\nheard nothing except the quick throbbing of their own hearts, until, at\r\nlast, there gradually came up a dull sound, which slowly resolved itself\r\ninto something like thumping and grinding.\r\n\r\nThey listened now with intense excitement and agitation to these sounds.\r\n\r\nWhat were they?\r\n\r\nThere was only one meaning which they were able to give to them. It\r\nseemed as if these sounds must indicate the breaking up of the lower\r\ncasing of logs that lined the pit--the first notice sent them of that\r\nbreak-up which was inevitable. Every sound seemed to tell of some new\r\nlog severed from its place by the pressure of the surrounding soil,\r\nwhich, now saturated with water, and transformed to a sort of ooze,\r\nstreamed through the crannies, and destroyed the staying of the pit. At\r\nthis thought the expectation of the end grew stronger, their awful doom\r\nseemed more immediate, and every nerve tingled, and every fibre of their\r\nbeing thrilled with a sense of horror.\r\n\r\nThey sat with their legs hanging over, and their hands grasping the log\r\nbeneath as firmly as they could. It was while they were in this position\r\nthat Bart felt something strike his foot. At that touch his first\r\nimpulse made him shrink back in terror, and jerk both feet into the air.\r\nThe same moment Pat felt the same, and evinced the same repugnance by a\r\nsimilar gesture. A moment’s thought, however, served to show Bart what\r\nit might be; so, reaching his feet down as far as he could in order to\r\ntest it, he found that his suspicions were correct, and that the water\r\nhad risen to that point. What had touched his foot was a log that had\r\nfloated on the top of the rising water.\r\n\r\nBut there were more than one log, and this was the discovery that Bart\r\nmade; and these logs were a dense mass that filled the pit, and were\r\ncarried up by the water in this way. They had loosened many logs at the\r\nbottom, and had stood the long ones upright, while the shorter ones lay\r\nlengthwise. It was in about this same position that the mass of logs now\r\nfloated up, and reached the place where they could be touched.\r\n\r\nIn a moment a joyful cry escaped Bart.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” cried Pat.\r\n\r\n“Were safe! we’re safe!” cried Bart.\r\n\r\nThese were the first words that had been spoken since Pat first\r\nannounced the entrance of the water.\r\n\r\n“Safe, is it?” said Pat. “I’d like to know how, so I would.”\r\n\r\n“Why, these logs; only feel with your feet, Pat. They’re all floating\r\nup. I never thought of that. Only feel how compact and solid they are.\r\nThey’ll bear our weight, and we can float up with them.” Pat for a\r\nmoment made no remark, but reached out his feet, and felt as far as he\r\ncould. Then a cry of joy burst from him.\r\n\r\n“Huroo!” he cried. “By the powers! but it’s safe we are. Sure it’s as\r\nsolid as a flure, so it is. It’s a raft that we have, and it’ll float us\r\nas high as it goes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if it don’t cave in first.”\r\n\r\n“Cave in, is it? O, sure but it won’t be likely to cave in up here at\r\nall at all.”\r\n\r\n“We’d better lie along at full length.”\r\n\r\n“An what’ll we do that for?”\r\n\r\n“O, so as to get the advantage of the floating power of all the logs. If\r\nwe stand on one or two they’ll sink down at once.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an that’s so. It’s right you are, so it is. We’ll lie down at full\r\nlingth; an O, don’t I wish we could take a bit of a nap!”\r\n\r\n“No, don’t think of that, Pat; we’ve got lots to do yet.”\r\n\r\n“Nappin? me nappin? Sure it’s only funnin I wor.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate, we need only to float up to the plank casing. Then we’ll\r\nbe all right. And it seems to be coming up pretty fast. It’s risen a\r\nfoot already, since we first felt it.”\r\n\r\n“So it has, sure.”\r\n\r\n“We’d better be getting ready. I’ll drop off first, and roll over to\r\nthe other side, and hold on to as many as I can, and then you come along\r\nafter me.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a bit, sure, till it gits a few inches higher. It’ll be up fast\r\nenough, sure.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, of course.”\r\n\r\nThe boys now waited in silence for a little while longer. The water\r\nrose steadily, bearing up the mass of logs on their surface. At length,\r\nslowly and cautiously, Bart allowed himself to pass upon the logs, and\r\nto his immense delight, found that they supported his weight.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah, Pat!” said he. “They’re as solid as a rock. Come along.”\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Pat was by his side.\r\n\r\n“I had no idea,” said Bart, “that they would be so solid.”\r\n\r\n“Nor me ayther,” said Pat.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what it is. The logs were stood upright, and as they floated\r\nup from the ground, they were turned in all directions, and got so mixed\r\nup, that each one supported the other, and the short logs have got mixed\r\nup with the long ones; and so it’s just like a regular raft, and they\r\nbear us as well as if they’d all been laid crosswise on purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Thrue for you,” said Pat; “an if it’s so solid, I don’t see why we\r\nmightn’t stand up.”\r\n\r\n“O, we’d better not. This is the safest way. We might jar them, or shake\r\nthem by putting too much weight on one spot.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s best not to be in too big a hurry,” said Pat, “an let well\r\nenough alone.”\r\n\r\nThe boys now relapsed into silence, and watched anxiously their\r\nprogress. By feeling the logs on the sides of the pit, they could\r\nperceive that they were rising at a rate that was very satisfactory.\r\nInch after inch slipped away from their fingers; log after log on the\r\nsides was covered by the rising water. And at intervals, as they looked\r\nup to measure their distance from the top, they could see that it was\r\nsteadily diminishing.\r\n\r\nYet the hope which had arisen within them did not blind them to the\r\ndanger that still surrounded them. Still there was the danger of the\r\nbroken log. The rope hung down, and never ceased to remind them, as they\r\nrose, that there was this above them, for the rope coiled itself over\r\nthem, and they feared to make the slightest movement, lest they might\r\ngive it a pull. Another danger was the chance that the pit might cave\r\nin, from having its foundations more and more sapped by the water.\r\nThis danger had been delayed for long, but the longer the time was, the\r\ngreater the danger grew. But most of all they feared lest the supply of\r\nwater might cease before they reached the plank casing. If these waters\r\ncame from the level of the sea, they would not rise in the pit higher\r\nthan that level; and whether that would bring them as high as the plank\r\ncasing, they could not tell. Their chief hope arose from the landlord’s\r\nstatement that the island was not more than thirty feet above the water,\r\nand if this was so, they knew that they might get to within thirty feet\r\nof the top. And the plank casing came down about as far as that.\r\n\r\nAnd so, full of hope and fear, which thus alternated, they floated up,\r\nrising higher and higher every minute, and feeling most carefully all\r\nthe while in order to note the progress which they made. At length the\r\nprogress grew somewhat slower, and hope began to grow faint; still, as\r\nit did actually continue, they struggled against despondency, and looked\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nTheir progress now grew slower. It seemed as though the force which\r\npressed the waters on was being gradually exhausted. Was this because\r\nthat water came from some internal reservoir, or because they had now\r\nreached a point almost at the level of the sea? They were not high\r\nenough yet, and they were not rising fast enough for their impatience.\r\n\r\nBart now stood up and felt. They were near to the lowest part of the\r\nplank casing, yet not near enough. Would they ever get nearer? At the\r\nrate at which they were now rising, they could scarcely hope to rise\r\nmore than one other foot at the farthest. And the plank casing was four\r\nfeet, at least, above his head--quite out of his reach. What then? Must\r\nthey lie down here and perish almost within reach of safety? For a few\r\nmoments it seemed so.\r\n\r\nBut it was only for a few moments. Suddenly the problem was solved.\r\n\r\n“Pat,” cried Bart, “I’ll stand here. You climb up till you get your feet\r\non my shoulders. You can reach the planking then.”\r\n\r\n“But how’ll you git up yourself?” asked Pat, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Why, when you git up, you can throw me that rope, of course,” said\r\nBart.\r\n\r\n“Sure enough. Och, but it’s the fool I am, sure, not to think of that.”\r\n\r\nNo more words were spoken. Pat did as Bart told him, climbing till his\r\nfeet rested on Bart’s shoulders. The lowest line of planks was within\r\nreach. Here he found a place to grasp with his hands, the logs below\r\naffording sufficient foothold. He found no difficulty. It was almost\r\nlike going up a ladder now, and in a few moments he was at the top.\r\n\r\nBut all danger was not yet over. He dared not touch the broken log, and\r\ncould not detach the rope without doing so. As the log was, it seemed to\r\nbe hanging by a few fibres, and the slightest touch might send it down.\r\nBut there were plenty of ropes at the hut, and he at once hurried away\r\nto procure one. He brought back one which was quite new, and therefore\r\nstrong enough; and also a crowbar. Driving the crowbar into the ground,\r\nhe bound the rope to it, and flung the end down to Bart, who had been\r\nwaiting patiently in the mean time. Pat now held the crowbar to steady\r\nit, and Bart, seizing the rope, raised himself up. A slight effort was\r\nsufficient to bring him up to within reach of the plank casing, and for\r\nthe rest of the way it was easy enough.\r\n\r\nAt last! There they stood, those two, who had of late been in such deep\r\nand dark despair. They stood there, drawing deep breaths of that glad\r\nupper air, and looked around. The moon shone from on high, throwing its\r\nlustre over the scene, and pouring upon the sea a silver flood. Joy and\r\ngratitude overwhelmed them, and with one common impulse they fell upon\r\ntheir kne’es, and gave thanks to that Merciful One who had drawn them up\r\n“out of a horrible pit,” and restored them to the light of life.\r\n\r\nBut their excitement and their labor had utterly exhausted them in\r\nmind and body. They were terribly fatigued. To row back to Chester was\r\nimpossible. They therefore went off at once to the little hut, and\r\nhere, flinging themselves upon the floor, they soon sank into a profound\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the boys, with the landlord, and Roach, had searched about the\r\nisland, until the minds of all were, filled with the deepest anxiety.\r\nThe hut still remained, and into this, not expecting to find anything,\r\nyet still anxious to search everywhere, they all went. There was an\r\nouter room full of ropes and tools, passing through which they came to\r\nan inner room.\r\n\r\nOut of a profound slumber Bart and Pat were abruptly roused, and opened\r\ntheir eyes to find themselves surrounded by their four companions,\r\nperfectly frantic with excitement and joy, together with two strangers,\r\nthe landlord and the man who had shown them the way, which two exhibited\r\na most profound emotion. After their first bewilderment, Bart and Pat\r\nfound it easy to guess at the meaning of this scene, and the memories\r\nwhich they had of their terrible adventure fully justified in their eyes\r\nthe wild joy of their friends. It was a comfort to them to perceive that\r\nthey had thus been promptly followed, for they saw that had they not\r\nbeen able to get out of the hole, they would have been rescued by these\r\nloving hands before all was lost.\r\n\r\nLong explanations were deferred for the present. Bart and Pat were in a\r\nstate of starvation, and their friends had forgotten to bring any food.\r\nBut Chester was not far away. The wind was fair, and before very long\r\nthey were all seated at the inn table, where the two lost ones satisfied\r\ntheir ravenous appetites, and the other boys made a second breakfast,\r\nwhich was more satisfactory than the first had been.\r\n\r\nAfter which Bart and Pat told the whole story minutely, answering every\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe wonder, the anxiety, and the horror that were manifested by the\r\nhearers during this narrative need not be described here. Roach insisted\r\nthat it was all the doings of Kidd, and maintained that life must yet be\r\nsacrificed, before the malign spirits would be appeased, and surrender\r\nthe treasure. The landlord, on the contrary, rightly viewed it as utter\r\nrecklessness on the part of the boys. The previous diggers had several\r\ntimes broken into what he called the “drain,” and the boys had done the\r\nsame thing, and so he declared all would do, till they should organize\r\nthe new company, and set up a steam engine.\r\n\r\nAnd here it may be as well to state that the new joint stock company was\r\nafterwards organized, and the steam engine set up, and a regular series\r\nof engineering experiments carried out. Coffer dams were constructed on\r\nthe shore, and ever so many new pits were dug in many different places.\r\nIn spite of all, however, the new company was a total failure; the\r\nwaters of the sea proved stronger than their puny arms; and the place\r\nknown as the original money-hole was never reached. Scientific men\r\nlaughed at the theory of Kidd’s treasure, and the drain, as all\r\nmoonshine, and said that the company might as well try to dig pits in a\r\nquicksand; but the stockholders clung to their faith even after they had\r\nfailed, and to this day talk about the “treasure,” the “money-hole,”\r\n the “chest,” and the “drain,” as though they were all solid and\r\nwell-established facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n_The Tale unfolded to Solomon and to Captain Corbet.--How they took\r\nit.--A New Departure.--A Bee-line for Home.--An Obstacle.--An\r\nold Enemy.--All at Sea literally and figuratively.--Terrible\r\nCalamity.--Striking a Rock.--Perilous Position.--Taking to the\r\nPumps.--Preparing for the Worst._\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO of the party in the Antelope had neither heard of the peril of Bart\r\nand Pat, nor known of their escape from it; and to these it was that\r\nthe information of these things came last of all, yet not with the\r\nleast profound effect. To Solomon the theory of the man Roach seemed\r\nunanswerable, and the very mention of it made his eyes roll about till\r\nnothing was visible except two revolving white disks on an ebon ground.\r\nHis fingers clasped one another nervously, and his jaw fell and remained\r\nhanging, as though the owner of it had no further use for it, or had\r\nlost all control of it. From Solomon’s former actions on different\r\noccasions, he had given indications of a nature that was not untinged\r\nwith superstition, and a fancy that was ready to kindle and flame up\r\nwith all those visions of the supernatural which seem so congenial to\r\nthe negro mind.\r\n\r\n“O, de sakes alive!” he exclaimed. “An under neaf de groun--an back agin\r\nsafe! What! down below dar to dat ar place! Clar, if it don’t make dis\r\nyer ole man go nigh stracted to think of. On dat ar island, down in dat\r\nar hole, dar’s a hull slew of ghosts an hobblegobblums ob de wustest\r\nsort ob pirates an murderers all lyin in wait, wid de ole boy himself,\r\nan a watchin ober de treasure.

Ef I’d ben down dar, I’d\r\ngon mad wid fright. But dar couldn’t be any danger ob me ebber goin\r\ndown--no, sah! You may bet high on dat ar. Not for all de treasure dat\r\nCap’n Kidd ebber buried.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet heard the harrowing story with a face full of sickening\r\nsuspense and terrible anxiety. In his gentle and affectionate nature\r\nhe seemed to suffer all that the boys had suffered. He made no remark\r\nwhatever, and after it was all told, he remained in silence for some\r\ntime, looking, in an abstracted way, at vacancy. The others respected\r\nhis evident emotion, and stood regarding him in solemn silence.\r\n\r\nAt length he raised his venerable head, and surveyed Bart and Pat with\r\nan impressive gaze; after which he looked at each of the other boys.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, well!” he said, slowly, and with emphasis; “had I a\r\nknowed--had I a thought--had I a s’posed--had I a dreampt of the\r\npossee-bility of this, I’d never a ventoored into any harbure till I cud\r\nanchor opposite my natyve hum. An I might have expected it--tew. I know\r\nhow it allus was, an might have expected how it allus was a goin for to\r\nbe. But this here does clap the climax. And whuffore? What upon airth\r\npossessed you to ventoor down under ground on a broken rope, hangin from\r\na rotten beam? Why, it won’t bar a thinkin on. It’s wuss than anythin\r\nthat’s happened among all that long an eventfuel serious of misfort’ns\r\nan clamties that’s ben a befallin of us ever sence we fust assembled\r\ntogether on board this here schewner.\r\n\r\n“And now what am I a goin to do? Do? Me? Why, I’ll tell you what I’m\r\na goin to do. I’m a goin to take up a bee-line for hum, an never enter\r\nanother harbure--no, not so much as look at one, till I get to the wharf\r\nat Grand Pré. This responsibility is tew, tew kerushin. I ain’t a stick,\r\nan I ain’t a stun, an I can’t abear it. A human heart beats in this\r\naged boosum, an it’s ben wrung on-common. I don’t want to get another\r\nsquinge. No--not me. An so I intend this day to hist anchor, an spread\r\nmy sail to catch the gale. An them, that wants to go hum by land air\r\nat liberty so to do--an peace an joy go with em; but them as wishes to\r\nstand by the ship ‘ll be welcome to the aged Corbet, an make his path of\r\nlife all the brighter for their presence. An, so sayin, I’ll kinclewd.”\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, thus announced, was one which the boys were not\r\nunwilling to accept. There was nothing more here which they particularly\r\ncared to see. After the adventure of Bart and Pat, the treasure of the\r\nseas and the plunder of the Spanish Main lost that dazzling and alluring\r\ncharm which hitherto had been found in those sounding words. The fact\r\nthat it was so inaccessible was of itself sufficient to quell their\r\nardor; but, more than this, they were affected by the information of\r\npast attempts to get at the treasure, and especially by the present\r\nefforts at forming a joint stock company. This at once vulgarized the\r\nwhole affair. It put it into the hands of every one. It made it a matter\r\nof shares and shafts, engineers and steam-engines. With such things as\r\nthese the boys felt they had nothing to do, and in them they took no\r\ninterest whatever. Then, finally, the adventure of Bart and Pat had so\r\nexhausted the possibilities of Ma-hone Bay, that they could hope for\r\nnothing which could surpass it.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was, that, not long after the happy return of Bart and\r\nPat, the Antelope once more set sail. The wind was fair, and the ship\r\nwas ready. The landlord and Roach watched them as they moved away, and\r\nwaved their hats after them as they passed down the harbor. And so\r\nthe Antelope went away, leaving behind her, in its resting-place,\r\nundisturbed, the treasure of the sea.\r\n\r\nAll that day the wind continued fair from the north-west, and all the\r\nnight following. The Antelope made a good run, and it was hoped that now\r\nthey might reach their destination without any further trouble; but, on\r\nthe following day, they found that these hopes were premature, and\r\nthat trials yet awaited them; for, on going to the deck, they saw, all\r\naround, and above, and beneath, their old enemy--the enemy that they\r\ndetested--the fog.\r\n\r\nYes, the fog was upon them--like some stealthy, vigilant, inexorable\r\nfoe, who, finding them thus setting forth on their last voyage for home,\r\nnow advanced upon them from all sides, to assail them for the last time.\r\nBruce saw this first, and groaned. Arthur groaned likewise. So did Tom\r\nand Phil. And so did Bart and Pat. As for Solomon, he took no notice of\r\nit whatever, but devoted himself, as usual, to his pots and pans,\r\nwhile Captain Corbet had far too philosophical a soul, and far too much\r\nexperience of such a situation, to be disturbed in the slightest degree\r\nby so commonplace a matter.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like this,” said Bruce, after a long and most unhappy silence,\r\nwhich told more eloquently than words their opinions as to this last\r\nmischance. “I didn’t expect it.”\r\n\r\n“We might have expected it,” said Arthur, “judging from the past. We’ve\r\nhad enough of it to make it seem natural. Still, I didn’t expect it, I\r\nmust say, any more than you did.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Phil, “I had forgotten all about it, and thought\r\nthat the Atlantic Ocean would be like Mahone Bay.”\r\n\r\n“I wish we had left the Antelope,” said Tom, “and gone off by land, as\r\nCaptain Corbet advised, either to Grand Pré, or anywhere else.”\r\n\r\n“O, sure an it’ll blow over, so it will,” said Pat. “Not it.”,\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s best to be afther lookin on the bright side.”\r\n\r\n“There isn’t any bright side to the fog that I could ever see,” said\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, “we’ll have to do as we’ve done before--grin and bear\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“But it’s a great deal harder to grin now than it used to be,” said\r\nPhil, plaintively; “and I can’t bear it at all.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, Captain Corbet’ll work his way along. He understands fog, at\r\nany rate.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t altogether think so,” said Bruce. “After losing himself\r\nso utterly a few days ago, and fetching up at Sable Island, I rather\r\nbegin to doubt his power to understand fog.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, that was in a strange place.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this is a strange place.”\r\n\r\n“Not quite. We are getting well on towards the Bay of Fundy.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’re not there yet. As yet, we’re in the Atlantic Ocean. Now,\r\nCaptain Corbet got lost once before in this same place,--the Atlantic\r\nOcean,--and it’s my fixed belief that he’ll do it again.”\r\n\r\n“O, we know where the coast of Nova Scotia is now, and we’re all right.\r\nI’m determined to look on the bright side.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and I’m determined to be prepared for the worst.”\r\n\r\nThe event showed that this fog did not have a bright side, and that it\r\nwas wiser, in these circumstances, to be prepared for the worst. That\r\nday passed, and the fog still held on. The wind that brought the fog\r\nwas strong, steady, and sustained, showing neither violence nor\r\nirresolution, but blowing in a way that promised to last long after\r\ntheir stock of patience was exhausted. It was a sou’-wester, the wind of\r\nfog and storm.\r\n\r\nAfter another day had passed, Captain Corbet’s face assumed an\r\nexpression, the meaning of which was but too well known to all the boys\r\nthrough sad experience. That meaning was, that he was puzzled, that he\r\nwas uncertain, hesitating, and not decided where to go. And the boys\r\ndiscussed this among themselves, and perceived that once again their\r\ngood, their venerable, their modest, but, after all, somewhat incapable\r\ncommander had again lost his way.\r\n\r\n“Ye see,” said he to Bruce, who mentioned this to him in a mild\r\nway,--“ye see thar’s ben so much tackin backard an forard that I kine o;\r\ngot out o’ the knack of it, an thar’s a kink or two in my cal’lations.\r\nEf we hadn’t got to alius beat up agin this sou’-wester, we’d manage\r\nto keep a better course; but, as it is, we ain’t got no course in\r\npa’ticular, wuth mentionin. An then thar’s them tides, an currents, an\r\nall that; an what with them, an tackin, an the fog, why, it’s got to be\r\nprecious hard navigatin.”\r\n\r\n“But why don’t you keep well in to the Nova Scotia shore?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, that thar’s the very identical thing I’m a drivin at, an I dar\r\nsay, if the fog was to lift, you’d see it quite handy over thar.”\r\n\r\n“But where are we now?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, as nigh as I can cal’clate, we’ve about got to the end of Nova\r\nScotia; an I’ve a mind to take a long tack to the nothe-west, next turn,\r\nan hain’t got no reasonable doubt but what we’ll keep on till we fetch\r\nup in old Fundy.”\r\n\r\nAll this was rather disheartening to the boys. They saw that Captain\r\nCorbet did not even profess to have any exact knowledge of his position,\r\nand, judging from the past, they did not believe that he had any. Still,\r\nthe change of course which he announced was something, and it seemed to\r\nafford some slight material for hope.\r\n\r\nAt length the Antelope came round on her next tack, and, taking a\r\nnorth-west course, she kept it for some time. At first the captain was\r\nrather watchful; but, after three or four hours, his vigilance began to\r\nrelax, and at length he ventured to announce to the boys that they must\r\nbe in the Bay of Fundy.\r\n\r\n“An when I’m here, in this Bay o’ Fundy, boys, mind you,” said he, with\r\nsomething of exultation in his tone,--“when I’m here, why, I’m to hum.\r\nThese waters was the place whar I sported in boyhood’s days. Here I\r\nmatoored into a man. Here I’ve held commoon with the ragin biller, an\r\nrode on the kerest of the toomultus ocean. You can’t disturb me when\r\nI’m in old Fundy. It’s my hum. Fog an tide hev ben my companions from\r\nchildhood, an the Bay of Fundy recognizes in the aged Corbet her--”\r\n\r\nBut what he was going to say was never said, for the word was taken out\r\nof his mouth, and exchanged for the interjection,--\r\n\r\n“Hallo!”\r\n\r\nThe Antelope had come to a sudden stop. The shock was strong enough to\r\nknock Captain Corbet on his knees, and huddle all the boys together in a\r\nstartled and struggling crowd.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Corbet was on his feet, and rushed forward to see what was\r\nthe matter. The boys followed. The helm was left to take care of itself,\r\nand the sails snapped and fluttered in the wind. All was confusion.\r\n\r\n“Why, I do believe,” said the captain, “I do rail-ly believe she’s\r\nstruck! Dear me! Wal, I never! This--doo--beat--my--grandmother!”\r\n\r\nThis allusion to his grandmother, under such circumstances, far from\r\nreassuring the boys, only excited their alarm the more, and made them\r\nthink that their revered commander had lost his senses.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” cried Bruce, “the Antelope’s struck, and is sinking. We’ll have\r\nto take to the boat. I’ll fill a keg of water. The rest of you gather a\r\nsupply of biscuit for a week, and one of you bring the compass.”\r\n\r\n“O, no; don’t trouble yourselves,” said Captain Corbet.\r\n“It’s--it’s--not--the slightest conse-kence. Don’t--don’t--hurry.”\r\n\r\nBut these and other words were lost on the boys, who, now in the full\r\nconviction that the Antelope was sinking, hurried to do as Bruce had\r\ntold them.\r\n\r\nBut Tom and Pat held back. Pat rushed to the mainmast, and busied\r\nhimself with some ropes; and Tom went to the pump, and, after taking a\r\npeep into the hold, began pumping.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or so he called out,--\r\n\r\n“I say, boys, there’s no hurry. There’s no water in her.”\r\n\r\nThese words made the others desist from their preparations. Seeing Tom\r\npumping, it struck them all that this was better than taking to the\r\nboat; so they all hurried to his help. As yet, however, there was\r\nnothing to be done.\r\n\r\n“O, thar’s no danger in p’tic’lar,” said Captain Corbet. “She’s struck\r\na sand-bank, paps, or, paps, a reef, somewhars. An now I wonder whar it\r\ncan be.”\r\n\r\nTo this remark, which showed his utter ignorance of the situation, the\r\nboys had no reply to make. Bruce, however, tied an iron belaying-pin\r\nto a rope, and began sounding for bottom. At the stern he found three\r\nfathoms, at the bows only three feet. He took a boat-hook, and, plunging\r\nit down into the water at the bows, found that it was smooth sand, and\r\nthe bows were resting upon it. This gave some comfort, for he hoped that\r\nthey might yet escape.\r\n\r\nBut the wind was strong, and the waves made the Antelope roll and\r\nwork about in her sandy bed after a most unpleasant fashion. If this\r\ncontinued long, the boys knew that the schooner would be lost, for\r\nshe could not resist such a strain as this. Still, they turned their\r\nthoughts now rather to the task of saving her, if possible, than taking\r\nto the boat; and so, lowering the sails, so as to lessen the effect of\r\nthe wind upon her, they set to work, some with the sweeps rowing, and\r\nothers with the boat-hook pushing, and thus they tried to get her off\r\nthe sand-bank.\r\n\r\n“It’s about the best thing we can do,” said Captain Corbet, in a\r\npatronizing tone; “an we’ll do it yet. An I dare say the tide’ll lift\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nThis mention of the tide cheered the boys. If the tide was rising,\r\nthey could hope; if not, it would be bad for them. A little calculation\r\nshowed them that it could not be falling, but must be rising, and this\r\ndiscovery made them work with renewed energy.\r\n\r\nAt length they had the satisfaction of finding that their efforts were\r\nsuccessful. The water at the bows deepened; the schooner moved. She was\r\nafloat! Quickly the sails were hoisted, and the Antelope, catching the\r\nwind, came round, and once more sought the deep water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\n_Once more upon the Waters.--Terrible Discovery.--A Foot of Water in the\r\nHold.--To the Pumps.--A desperate Struggle.--The Evening Meal.--Captain\r\nCorbet gazes on Vacancy.--A laborious Night--New Toils.--Exhaustion.--\r\nFighting with the rising Waters.--Discouragement.--The Leak gains on\r\nthem.--The End approaching._\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT though the Antelope was once more in deep water, their troubles\r\nwere not yet over, for others soon arose almost as grave as the one from\r\nwhich they had just escaped. First of all, the uncertainty of Captain\r\nCorbet as to his position had evidently returned. He had that expression\r\nof concern, bewilderment, and confusion which shows a puzzled mind. He\r\nsaid nothing, but, after about a quarter of an hour’s run, brought the\r\nAntelope about, and went on another tack. And now the wind, which all\r\nday had been rather fresh, began to lessen more and more, until after\r\nabout a couple of hours it had almost died away.\r\n\r\nAll this time Solomon had been on deck. He had come up when the Antelope\r\nstruck, and had worked away with the rest in their efforts in getting\r\nher off. Afterwards he had remained, out of a natural feeling of\r\ncuriosity, to see whether any more rocks or sand-banks were to be\r\nencountered. This danger, however, now seemed to have passed away, and\r\nSolomon became mindful of the duties of a cook. He therefore went below\r\nto prepare the evening’s repast.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he done so, than he bounded up again out of the hold upon\r\ndeck. His eyes were staring, his jaw dropped, and if his black face\r\ncould have shown anything like pallor, it would have done so at that\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n“Da-da-da-dars--a--leak. Da-da-dars a foot of water down below!” he\r\ngasped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0255]\r\n\r\nAt this astounding and alarming intelligence the boys rushed down into\r\nthe hold. Solomon’s information was right. Over the floor there was\r\nas much as six inches of water, and everything that lay there was\r\nsaturated.\r\n\r\nAt once the whole truth flashed upon them. The Antelope had rolled and\r\ntwisted herself on the sand-bank so much, that her timbers and planks\r\nhad been opened, and a dangerous leak had been established. It was not\r\na broken place, or a hole that could be stopped up, but evidently some\r\ngeneral leakage arising from the strain to which she had been subjected.\r\n\r\nThis served, in the opinion of all, to fill up the measure of their\r\ntroubles. Bad enough it was to be enclosed in the fog; bad enough to\r\nbe without any knowledge of their situation; bad enough to be in the\r\nviciuity of dangerous shoals, and perhaps rocks; but in addition to all\r\nthis, to have their vessel leaking, this indeed was a thing which might\r\nwell cause despair. And accordingly at the first sight of the water\r\nin the hold, every one of them stood as if paralyzed, and looked on\r\nmotionless and in dead silence.\r\n\r\nBart was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n“Come, boys,” said he. “We’ve every one of us been in worse scrapes than\r\nthis. After being on a water-logged ship, we oughtn’t to care for a few\r\ninches of water. Let’s go to the pump, and see if we can’t get rid of\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Bart leaped up to the deck, and sprang to the pump,\r\nfollowed by all the others. Only two of them could work at a time. Bart\r\nand Phil worked away first, till they were exhausted. Then Arthur\r\nand Pat took hold, and were relieved by Bruce and Tom. They worked\r\nvigorously, and with a will, in all the freshness, too, of their first\r\nefforts. Every one of them had a confident expectation that this labor\r\nwould be successful, and that a half an hour, at the farthest, would be\r\nenough to pump the schooner dry. But a half hour passed, and yet that\r\nresult was not accomplished. There was a difference certainly, but not\r\nanything like what they had wished. Judging from the amount of labor\r\nthat they had put forth in this half hour, and the slight result, they\r\nwere filled with dismay at the prospect before them.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Tom, “it ain’t what we expected; but I dare say we expected\r\ntoo much. Perhaps we ought to be satisfied if we find that we can keep\r\nthe water under.”\r\n\r\n“But can we do it?” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Of course we can. Haven’t we been doing it?”\r\n\r\n“We have--certainly. But how long can we keep at this sort of work?\r\nWhy, the pump’ll have to be kept going day and night.”\r\n\r\nWade and Solomon now went to work; but their efforts made no very\r\nperceptible diminution in the water in addition to what had already\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid,” said Bruce, “that the leak gets steadily worse.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Well, because Solomon and Wade don’t do more than any two of us.”\r\n\r\n“O, they don’t work with such a will.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not. But in pumping, I dare say steady efforts like theirs\r\namount to as much at least as our quick way of working; and besides,\r\nthey’re stronger, and ought to do more. I think the leak is worse.”\r\n\r\n“O, I don’t believe it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it took about two hours for the water to come in that’s in her\r\nnow. If it had been coming in so slowly as that, we would have pumped\r\nher dry by this time. But the fact is, the more we pump, the faster\r\nthe water comes in. I think it is working its way through new seams and\r\ncrevices.”\r\n\r\nThere was no further reply to this; but not long afterwards, when Bruce\r\nand Tom had pumped with unusual vigor, they examined the hold once more.\r\nThey found about six inches of water. The water had gained therefore. It\r\nhad come back to the amount which had been there when they first began.\r\nThese last efforts had gained nothing. In spite of all the water that\r\nhad been poured out over the side, the quantity below was the same.\r\nThere was no longer the slightest doubt that the leak was increasing,\r\nand that, too, with a rapidity that was very alarming. And while the\r\nleak thus gained power, their own efforts could not possibly increase\r\nbeyond what they had already been, but, as a matter of course, would, on\r\nthe contrary, rather decrease. And yet there was nothing else to be done\r\nbut to pump on, for if they relinquished their efforts, they were lost.\r\nSo they kept at it, taking turns as before, and while any two were\r\nat the pump, the others occupied themselves with watching the water\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nIn one of the intervals, Solomon prepared the evening meal. It was later\r\nthan usual, and any other than he would have omitted it altogether. But\r\nSolomon knew too well its importance, and felt that now it was, perhaps,\r\nof more importance than ever. The boys also, in the intervals which they\r\nhad, prepared provisions for the boat. They put in oars, the boat’s mast\r\nand sail, two kegs of water; amounting to about twenty gallons, a barrel\r\nof biscuit, a ham, and a few other articles. In this way they endeavored\r\nto prepare themselves for the worst, and to have everything ready when\r\nthe critical moment should arrive.\r\n\r\nAll this time Captain Corbet was mooning at the helm. He occasionally\r\noffered a remark, of which, however, no heed was taken by the busy\r\ncompany. They had something else to do.\r\n\r\n“Ef I’d ony a come straight along from Bosting,” said he, on one of\r\nthose occasions,--“ef I now at this moment was a navigatin from Bosting,\r\nI’d know whar I be. For I never know that I ever did lose my reckonin\r\non one of them thar vyges. But comin up in this here roundabout circuous\r\nway from them outlandish seas, made me kine o’ git everythin upset and\r\njumbled together in my old head. An now where air we? ’Tis a pint I\r\nlong to know. Blest if I know.\r\n\r\n“I should be pleased,” he continued, in a meditative tone, “to find out\r\nwhat course is the best for us jest now; though for that matter thar\r\nain’t overly much wind, and I don’t seem to see how we could sail\r\nanywhars, even ef we wanted to go, an knowed jest the pint to go to. But\r\nas soon’s the wind does rise, I have an idee of the course I’m goin to\r\ntake.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” asked Bart, who happened to be near and hear this last\r\nremark. It seemed to him a good sign that Captain Corbet should have any\r\ntheory now about his position.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, “it kine o’ seems to me as if the best way\r\nwould be to head her nothe-east. We can’t head her nothe agin in this\r\nfog; r’else we’ll hit another rock; but ef we keep her nothe-east, we\r\nmay dodge the rocks, an fetch up somewhars.”\r\n\r\nAt this utterly vague and unsatisfactory statement Bart turned away,\r\nmore disheartened than ever.\r\n\r\nThat night the boys took turns till about midnight, when they all turned\r\nin, leaving Solomon, Wade, and the captain to take turns pumping till\r\nmorning. The wind had gone down almost altogether, and the sea was quite\r\nsmooth. The water in the hold remained at about the same level; and when\r\nthe boys turned in, they had a feeling of satisfaction at this, or\r\nthey would have had, if they had not been so completely worn out. Their\r\nsleeping-place was not their usual one. The water had driven them out.\r\nThey brought their mattresses on deck, rolled themselves up in blankets,\r\nand curled up there the best way they could. So they passed the night.\r\n\r\nOn the following day they awaked early. There was a moderate breeze,\r\nand the Antelope was making some progress running before it. But the fog\r\nstill continued, and environed them on all sides.\r\n\r\nOf this, however, they took no note just then. Their first thought was\r\nabout the leak. They saw Wade working away at the pump in that dull,\r\nmechanical fashion which distinguished him in everything that he did.\r\nThey said nothing to him, but at once looked into the hold.\r\n\r\nThe sight that they saw there confirmed their worst fears. The water had\r\nincreased during the night, and they saw at once that either the leak\r\nhad grown worse, or else that the pumping had been neglected. Things did\r\nnot look well either for them or for the Antelope..\r\n\r\n“We’ve all ben a takin of our turn thro the night,” said Captain Corbet,\r\nwho was, as usual, at the helm. “It seems to be considerable of a leak.\r\nBut I dar say we’ll manage to keep it down. The Antelope hadn’t ought to\r\nbe a leaky vessel either. I’ve alius took good car of her. But it’s that\r\nstrain she got.”\r\n\r\n“Why, there’s a foot of water, at least,” cried Bart, “over the floor.\r\nThere must be over two feet of water in the hold.”\r\n\r\n“Full that,” said Arthur, gravely. “At this rate we’ll have to take to\r\nthe boat before long.”\r\n\r\n“O, thar’s no hurry,” said Captain Corbet; “the old Antelope’s dreadful\r\nperseverin, and a tremen-jous hand at keepin afloat.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bruce, “I rather think we may fight off the water to-day,\r\nat any rate, and the fog may lift before night.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Phil, “we’d better not take to the boat till the last\r\nmoment. I’d rather be here taking my turn at the pump, than off in the\r\nboat, not knowing where we are or where we’re going.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s a pity there wasn’t another pump,” said Pat. “We cud do\r\ndouble the work, so we cud. An I’d be proud to take me turrun at the\r\npump twice as often, so I would.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you what, boys,” said Tom. “Some of us might bale out with\r\npails, while we’re not pumping. I wish I could construct a siphon; but I\r\nsuppose it couldn’t be managed; so let’s bale. Two at the pump, and the\r\nrest at pails. That ought to be equal to two pumps, at least.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’ll be aqual to fower pumps, so it will, if we work hard\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\nThis proposal was excellent in its way, only there was a doubt as to\r\nwhether they could muster four pails. After some search two were found,\r\nand Solomon produced a tin kettle. This made three. Pat then brought\r\nforth a coal scuttle, which was well adapted for the work. With these\r\nincreased resources they now set to work. Jumping down into the hold,\r\nfour of them baled out the water, and poured it upon the deck, from\r\nwhich it ran into the sea. They worked at this most zealously and most\r\nindustriously for two hours. At the end of that time they were all\r\nutterly exhausted. They had taken turns at the pump and at the pails,\r\nand the continuous work without rest had told most severely upon them\r\nall. They all felt that this would utterly use them up, if persisted\r\nin much longer. At the same time they had the satisfaction of seeing a\r\nperceptible diminution in the water, though by no means as much as they\r\nhad hoped to find; and they all felt as though they had not received an\r\nadequate reward for such exhaustive labors. They saw that if they hoped\r\nto continue at the pump, it was absolutely necessary to give up the\r\nbaling, and rest until the turn of each should come. And so the baling\r\nwas given up.\r\n\r\nA hasty breakfast was taken. Solomon had to give up his work as cook,\r\nand take his turn at the pump, and therefore every one had to forage for\r\nhimself. Already, however, Solomon had taken the precaution to remove\r\nthe stores from the hold and cabin up to the deck, where they would be\r\nout of the reach of the water, at least as long as the schooner could\r\npretend to float. Out of these stores each one could now supply himself\r\nwhenever and however he might feel inclined.\r\n\r\nHaving given up the idea of baling, the boys, in the intervals of taking\r\nturn at the pump, had nothing else to do now than to gather up strength\r\nfor a new effort. While so doing, they watched the state of the water\r\nin the hold; or tried to penetrate the veil of fog that hung around; or\r\nlistened, hoping to hear some sound that might tell of ships in their\r\nneighborhood. Sometimes, also, they sounded on the “fog-horn” of the\r\nAntelope--a peculiar tin trumpet with which every Down East coaster or\r\nfisher is provided, and which makes the most unearthly sound that has\r\never been contrived by man, not even excepting the yell of an asthmatic\r\nsteam whistle. But looking, and listening, and sounding on the trumpet\r\nwere alike unavailing, for no sight, or sound, or answering note of any\r\nkind came to them through that wall of mist.\r\n\r\nAll this was depressing. The fog was depressing. The fact that they\r\nhad lost their way was depressing. But most of all, their own exertions\r\nproved depressing, for those exertions seemed unavailing. Still the\r\nwaters crept ahead of them. They were not able to hold their own. After\r\ntheir vigorous and exhaustive efforts at baling, the water, held at bay\r\nfor a time, came back to the assault, and this time it triumphed over\r\nthe pump, and rose slowly, yet steadily. By the close of the day the\r\nwater in the hold was enough to startle even the phlegmatic Wade. That\r\npersonage had taken some sleep during the afternoon, after a long tug at\r\nthe pump, and had snoozed away as calmly as an infant until sunset. On\r\nwaking he walked to the hold, and looked down. The sight was by no means\r\nreassuring. Nearly two feet of water rolled backward and forward at\r\nthe motion of the Antelope. He shook his phlegmatic, unexcitable,\r\nundemonstrative head.\r\n\r\n“My name’s Wade,” he said, speaking as if to himself. “An my old\r\n’oman’s name’s Gipson. An you’ll not find many o’ that name in this\r\ncountry. No, sir.”\r\n\r\nHe took another look.\r\n\r\nAgain his head gave a solemn and portentous shake.\r\n\r\nThen he said once more,--\r\n\r\n“No, sir!”\r\n\r\nAnd the pump went on.\r\n\r\nAnd pump struggled with sea.\r\n\r\nAnd the sea gained!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\n_A miserable Night.--No one shrinks.--Their Efforts lessen.--Morning\r\ncomes.--Four Feet of Water in the Hold.--Take to the Boat!--Come along,\r\nCaptain!--The Dignity of Corbet.--The Folly of Pat.--The Insanity of\r\nSolomon.--The Imbecility of Wade.--The Perplexity of the Boys.--Dat ar\r\nole Woman!--An Agony of Impatience.--Four on board tempting Fate._\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT came--a miserable--miserable night! On the previous night, the\r\nboys had slept; but this night, sleep was not thought of by any one of\r\nthem. Exhausted though they all were by hard work, they yet felt the\r\nposition of the Antelope to be too perilous to think of sleep. It was a\r\ntime for vigilance. It was a time when each one had to keep himself\r\nwide awake, and hold himself prepared to rush to the boat at a moment’s\r\nwarning. The boat floated astern, as usual, and in it were all the\r\nstores that might be necessary for a lengthened row; but they wished to\r\npostpone any recourse to this boat to the latest possible moment. And\r\nall the time the Antelope held on her course, impelled by a fair, yet\r\nmoderate breeze, that blew directly astern.\r\n\r\nExhausted though they were, yet none of them shrunk from his task. All\r\ntook turns. Corbet and Wade, Wade and Solomon, Corbet and Solomon; then\r\nthe boys, two by two, at the pump; each couple laboring strenuously and\r\nconscientiously, yet showing the same result. For, whoever it was that\r\nworked, or whatever was the amount of labor expended, the result seemed\r\nin each case a failure and a defeat. They were struggling against a\r\ncommon enemy; but the enemy was gaining. In spite of their efforts, the\r\nwaters continued to rise, and there was no way by which they could bring\r\nany additional labor to bear. Had there been another pump, they would\r\nhave been in a better position. At about midnight they undertook a\r\nsecond time to supplement the pumping with baling, but again desisted on\r\naccount of the utter exhaustion which followed such severe toil. It only\r\nlessened their power of working at the pump. So once more they gave it\r\nup.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on their efforts grew less and less. The long toil had\r\ntold upon every one of them, more particularly upon the boys. The\r\nlabors of Captain Corbet, of Solomon, and of Wade, were less vigorous\r\ncertainly; yet still, they were even and well sustained; but those of\r\nthe boys grew more and more fitful, irregular, and feeble.\r\n\r\nEach time that any two of them came to take their turn, they felt as\r\nthough this must be the last. And so the hours and the labors of that\r\ndreary night dragged on.\r\n\r\nMorning came.\r\n\r\nAll the boys felt that their capacity for work was well nigh exhausted.\r\nMorning came, and brought the fog. No land appeared. No ship was in\r\nsight. They sounded a blast on the fog horn, but no reply came.\r\n\r\nMorning came, and brought, worse than all, the sight of four feet of\r\nwater in the Antelope’s hold,--an amount so great that further pumping\r\nwas useless, and at the best could only delay for a very short time a\r\ndoom that was inevitable.\r\n\r\nMorning came, then, and brought this sight; and the four feet of water\r\nin the Antelope’s hold at once forced a change in the decision of those\r\non board.\r\n\r\nThey saw that if they continued pumping they might delay the decisive\r\nmoment somewhat, but that it must come; and if it came with all of them\r\non board, they must sink with the sinking schooner. And that the end\r\nwas near, they could see. There was no time for delay. Already the signs\r\nwhich met their view told them that the end was near.\r\n\r\nTake to the boat!\r\n\r\nThis was now their thought. To the boat,--before it was too late! On\r\nboard the boat were all the stores necessary for a protracted voyage;\r\nand they all began to feel that this boat was now a better place\r\nthan the sinking Antelope. The boat was a place of rest; a place more\r\nrestricted-, yet still, one which promised comparative peace and safety.\r\nTo that boat, therefore, they must go, before it was too late; while yet\r\nthey could embark in peace, and move away from the doomed Antelope.\r\n\r\nNor was a resort to the boat so hopeless an undertaking as it might\r\nappear to have been. At the worst, they were in a part of the world\r\nwhere ships are frequent; and some of them thought that land was near\r\nenough to be seen in some direction if only the fog should be\r\ndispelled. The stores in the boat were sufficient to sustain life for\r\na considerable time, and they would be free from the necessity of\r\nincessant and most exhaustive labor.\r\n\r\nThere was now no time for any delay or any hesitation. They all felt\r\nthis. The sight of the Antelope’s hold decided them.\r\n\r\nThey must take to the boat.\r\n\r\n“Come along, captain,” said Bart. “We mustn’t stay any longer. The\r\nAntelope’ll go down before half an hour. If we pump any longer we’ll\r\nall be used up, and won’t delay her sinking more than five minutes. Come\r\nalong.”\r\n\r\n“Goin doun!” said Captain Corbet, dreamily. “Only think of the Antelope\r\ngoin doun!”\r\n\r\n“Come, captain,” said Bruce, taking his arm. “The boat’s all ready.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes,” said the captain; “and the Antelope’s goin doun! Dear me! Only\r\nthink of it!”\r\n\r\n“Captain Corbet,” said Arthur, solemnly, “we’re all ready. Come, go\r\naboard the boat.”\r\n\r\n“Well--well--well,” said the captain. “Very well. O, all right. O, yes.\r\nYou jest git into the boat. Git along. Never mind me. I’ll wait a while,\r\nyou know. You go ahead. I’ll jest meander around here while you’re\r\ngettin into the boat. All right.”\r\n\r\nAt this the boys went off to the boat, and dropped in one after the\r\nother. Bruce, and Arthur, and Tom, and Phil, and Bart. Pat lingered\r\nbehind. Those who had got into the boat expected that the others would\r\nfollow at once, and now looked eagerly towards them.\r\n\r\nThey were afloat astern; and there, at the stern of the Antelope, stood\r\nCaptain Corbet, surveying them with a melancholy air.\r\n\r\n“Come along, captain,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“O, all right. Wait till the rest go,” said he. “Tain’t right for me\r\nto clar out jest yet. The captain must allers be the last to quit the\r\nsinkin ship.”\r\n\r\nAt this the boys called to the others,--to Pat, who had lingered behind,\r\nto Solomon, and to Wade.\r\n\r\nPat was standing by the mainmast, To their amazement, they saw that he\r\nwas busily engaged in binding himself to it with ropes.\r\n\r\n“Pat,” cried Bart, “why don’t you hurry up?”\r\n\r\nPat made no reply, but went on as before, solemnly and methodically.\r\n\r\n“Pat,” cried Tom, “what in the world are you waiting for? Hurry up! What\r\nare you doing?”\r\n\r\n“Sure it’s tyin meself to the mast, I am,” said Pat.\r\n\r\n“What,” cried Bruce, “tying yourself to the mast! What nonsense! What do\r\nyou mean?”\r\n\r\n“Sure it’s the right thing to do,” said Pat. “It’s what they allers\r\ndoes, so it is, wheniver a ship gits wracked. Sure I know; and I advise\r\nyou to do the same.”\r\n\r\n“He’s tying himself to the mast!” cried Phil. “He’s mad. He’s insane.\r\nSome of us’ll have to drag him on board.”\r\n\r\n“Pat,” cried Barty, “come along. Are you crazy? The Antelope’s sinking!\r\nWhat do you mean? Stop that. If you tie yourself to the mast, you’ll go\r\ndown with her. What nonsense! Drop that rope, and come with us.”\r\n\r\n“Sure it’s safer here,” said Pat, calmly, “than on that bit of a boat,\r\nso it is.”\r\n\r\n“But the Antelope’s sinking.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, don’t I know it? Meself does.”\r\n\r\n“But you’ll go down in her, if you do that.”\r\n\r\n“Arrah, what are you talking about? In shipwracks, doesn’t everybody tie\r\nthemselves to the mast?”\r\n\r\n“What in the world shall we do?” cried Bart, in despair. “He’s crazy. I\r\nnever saw anything like it. He’s got a craze about tying himself to the\r\nmast. Don’t you remember how he did the very same on board the Petrel?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to go and untie him,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Only see how he’s fastening and knotting the rope,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to seize him, and bring him here by main force,” said\r\nArthur.\r\n\r\nBut from these thoughts they were now diverted by the appearance of\r\nSolomon. He had been very busy for about a quarter of an hour, and was\r\nnow pulling away at a rope, as though the salvation of the whole party\r\ndepended upon the successful accomplishment of his design.\r\n\r\n“Solomon,” cried Bart, “hurry, hurry! Come along! Hurry! The Antelope’s\r\ngoing down fast! Hurry, and bring Pat along with you. The captain’s\r\nwaiting till you leave the Antelope. Hurry!\r\n\r\n“I’se jest a histin up dis yer cookin-stove,” said he. “Ben tyin de\r\nropes roun it ebery which way, an jes got her ready to be put into de\r\nboat.”\r\n\r\n“The what!” cried Arthur.\r\n\r\n“De cookin-stove,” said Solomon, gravely.\r\n\r\n“He’s mad!” cried Bruce. “He’s gone crazy. Pat and Solomon have both\r\ngone mad with excitement or terror.”\r\n\r\n“You jes gib a left here, an help dis ole man put dis yer cookin-stove\r\naboard de boat, an den you ’ll be all right.”\r\n\r\n“Solomon! Solomon!” cried Bart, “what horrible nonsense! What do you\r\nmean by talking about putting a cooking-stove on board the boat? Come\r\nalong. Be quick.”\r\n\r\n“Tell you what,” said Solomon, “dis yer stove am a nessary succumstance.\r\nHow you s’pose you get you meals cooked? Mus hab a cookin-stove. Mus so.\r\nYou got water to bile, and things to cook.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense;” cried Bart. “Can’t you see that it’ll sink the boat?”\r\n\r\n“But what’ll you do?” said Solomon. “You’ll suffer if you don’t take it.\r\nYou mus hab a cookin-stove. Mus so!”\r\n\r\nAt this obstinate persistence in such unaccountable folly the boys were\r\nin despair. The schooner was sinking, lower and lower every minute, and\r\nthere were those on board of her, wasting precious time and chattering\r\nnonsense. What could be the meaning of this? Had terror deprived them\r\nof their senses? It seemed so. There was Captain Corbet, absorbed in\r\nhis own thoughts, evidently quite forgetful of the present danger, and\r\nunconscious of the scene around him. There was Wade, with his heavy face\r\ngaping from the windlass, where he had seated himself. There was Pat,\r\nstill tying himself to the mast; and there was Solomon, toiling away\r\nat the cooking-stove. It was like a small floating lunatic asylum. They\r\nmight well feel puzzled and bewildered.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly one part of this very difficult problem was solved of its\r\nown accord. Solomon had not been very careful in the selection of his\r\nhoisting apparatus. He had picked up some bits of rope, and fastened\r\nthem around the cooking-stove for slings, and into this he had passed\r\nthe hook from the schooner’s tackle. He pulled and labored away,\r\nhoisting the heavy stove, and succeeded in raising it about half way\r\nabove the hatches. A few more pulls, and it would have been on the deck.\r\nBut there’s many a slip ’twixt cup and lip; and so it was destined\r\nto prove in this case. For at the very moment when the stove hung thus\r\nsuspended, the slings suddenly gave way, and with a rush the heavy mass\r\ndescended, falling with a loud crash to the bottom, and with a force\r\nthat seemed sufficient to break through the Antelope’s bottom. There it\r\nlay--a ruin!\r\n\r\nSolomon stood and stared in silence at the scene. At length, drawing a\r\nlong breath, he raised his head and looked at the boys.\r\n\r\n“Dar,” said he; “dat ar’s allus de way; troubles neber comes single. Dis\r\nyer shows dat de end am come. Smash goes de cookin-stove, an shows dat\r\ndis yer scursium’s a goin to tumminate in clamty. Dar ain’t a goin to be\r\nno more eatin in dis yer party; dat’s all done up.”\r\n\r\n“Solomon! Solomon!” cried Bart, “hurry up!” “Solomon! Pat! Wade! Captain\r\nCorbet! Come! Quick! Hurry up! Quick!”\r\n\r\nSuch were the cries that now burst from those in the boat. They were\r\nfloating close by the schooner, so as to be convenient for those who\r\nwere yet on board. They had seen the destruction of the unfortunate\r\ncooking-stove, and were now eager to get away before the schooner should\r\nsink. But their patience was destined to be still further taxed, for\r\nSolomon continued to make observations on the fallen stove; and Pat went\r\non winding the rope about himself and the mast; and Wade sat motionless\r\non the windlass; and Captain Corbet stood in the same attitude as\r\nbefore,--in the attitude habitual with him, his hands mechanically\r\ngrasping the tiller, and his mild eyes fixed before him, as though he\r\nwas still steering the Antelope, and watching some shore ahead. But\r\nbefore him there was only fog; and what he might have seen was not\r\nvisible to the material eye.\r\n\r\n“No use,” said Solomon. “Dese yer may go, but I’se boun to stay. De\r\ncaptain may go; an mas’r Wade, he may go; an Pat mus frow away dem\r\nropes. But for me, I’se goin to stick to de ole Antelope.”\r\n\r\n“But she’s sinking, and sinking fast,” cried Bart, with feverish\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n“Dar’s no odds to dis ole man. Ef I can’t stick to de Antelope, I don’t\r\nwant to go no whars else. Dar’s somebody a waitin for me, an I ain’t a\r\ngoin to ’spose mysef to her, no how.”\r\n\r\n“But you’ll be drowned; you’ll be drowned. O, Solomon!” cried Bart, “cut\r\nPat’s ropes, and make him come; and hurry.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, captain. Make haste. Cut Pat’s ropes, Solomon. Come, Wade.\r\nThe schooner’ll go down in five minutes!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t care!” said Solomon; “don’t care a mite. I’se dreadful fraid ob\r\ndat ar ole woman. I’d rader be drowned here dis yar way, dan be hammered\r\nto def wid a red-hot poker. Dat’s so; mind I tell you.”\r\n\r\nThe boys were now in an agony of impatience and anxiety. The waters were\r\nhigh in the hold of the Antelope. They could see, from where they stood\r\nin the boat, the dark gleam of the rising flood, and knew that any\r\nmoment might now witness the last plunge of the schooner into the depths\r\nbelow. And so they shouted, and screamed, and called upon every one in\r\nsuccession of those who still so madly lingered behind. But their cries\r\nwere unheeded; for those four on the deck of the Antelope made not the\r\nslightest movement in response.\r\n\r\nWhen the boys had left the Antelope, the water in her hold was about\r\nfour feet in depth. All the time since then it had been increasing; yet,\r\nafter all, though the time seemed long to the anxious boys, not over a\r\nquarter of an hour had elapsed in reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\n_The Waters rise.--The Boys try Force.--Attach on Pat.--He is\r\noverpowered.--My Name’s Wade.--An Irish Howl.--Solomon\r\nimmovable.--The Ancient Mariner at his Post.--The Boys fly.--Flight\r\nof Solomon.--“Drefful Times.”--Captain Corbet sings his Death Song.--A\r\nRhapsody on the Antelope.--The rising Waters.--The doomed Schooner.--The\r\nrolling Seas.--The Antelope sinking.--The Form of Corbet slowly\r\ndisappearing beneath the raging Seas._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE waters continued to rise in the hold of the Antelope, and inch by\r\ninch the doomed schooner settled slowly down into the depths beneath. On\r\nthe deck stood those four who still held aloof from the boat, and seemed\r\nto be animated by some insane or unintelligible motive. By the side of\r\nthe schooner floated the boat, in which were Bruce, Arthur, Tom, Phil,\r\nand Bart. They were all standing up, and holding the Antelope’s rail,\r\nand shouting, bawling, yelling, entreating, threatening, and using every\r\npossible means to save their unfortunate companions.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Bart drew his knife.\r\n\r\n“Boys!” said he, “we’ll have to drag them off. Bruce and Arthur, come\r\nalong. Tom and Phil, you mind the boat.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he jumped on board the Antelope, with his open knife in\r\nhis hand. Bruce and Arthur leaped on board after him.\r\n\r\nThe sight of Bart, with his open knife, thus bounding on board the\r\nAntelope, astonished the other boys, who began to think that Bart, like\r\nthe others, had also lost his senses; but they did as he said--Tom and\r\nPhil holding the boat to the side of the Antelope, and watching, while\r\nBruce and Arthur followed Bart.\r\n\r\nBart first rushed to Pat.\r\n\r\n“We’re not going to stand this. You’re ruining us all. If you don’t go\r\naboard the boat, we’ll throw you overboard, and you’ll be glad to do it\r\nthen. Bruce and Arthur, catch hold, and pitch Pat overboard if he don’t\r\ngo to the boat.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking these words with breathless rapidity, Bart cut the rope with\r\nwhich Pat had bound himself, giving long slashes up and down. Bruce\r\nand Arthur seized him at the same moment, and as soon as the rope was\r\nsevered, dragged him to where the boat was, ordering him on board,\r\nand threatening to throw him into the water if he refused. Pat was\r\npowerless. A few words of remonstrance were offered, but he was sternly\r\nsilenced. He was thus overpowered, and so, yielding to necessity, he got\r\non board the boat. There he seated himself in the stern, and, bowing\r\nhis head, began a long, low, wailing Irish “keen,” which is a species of\r\nlamentation in the presence of death.\r\n\r\nThis scene appeared to produce some effect upon Wade. It roused him\r\nfrom his lethargy. It seemed as though this man was a mere machine; and\r\nthough in ordinary circumstances he was able of going through certain\r\nroutine duties, in any extraordinary case he was utterly helpless, and\r\nhis dull and inert nature became hopelessly imbecile. But now an idea\r\nof his situation seemed at last to have penetrated to his brain, and\r\naccordingly, rising to his feet, he went to the boat. Then he slowly and\r\nsolemnly passed over the Antelope’s side, and took his seat near Pat.\r\nHe looked at the others with a dull stare, and then turning to Pat, he\r\nremarked, in a low, confidential tone, “My name’s Wade, an my ole\r\n‘oman’s name’s Gipson; an you’ll not find many o’ that name in this\r\ncountry. No, sir.”\r\n\r\nAfter which he heaved a sigh, and relapsed into himself. As to Pat,\r\nhe took no notice of this confidence imparted to him, but went on with\r\nhis Irish lamentation.\r\n\r\n“Ow--O-o-o-o-ow--to only think--this bit ov a boat sure--an in the\r\nwide an impty say--an me a bindin meself to the only safety; for\r\nthe ship-wracked sayman must always bind himsilf to a mast. And,\r\nO-o-o-b-o-o-o-w, but it was a bitter, crool thing, so it was, to tear\r\na poor boy from his solitary rifuge--an dhrive him here into a bit ov a\r\nboat--to sail over the impty say--an from the last rifuge--where safety\r\nwas, an O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ow! but it’s the croolty ov it that braks me\r\nheart!”\r\n\r\nThe summary treatment with which the boys had disposed of Pat, was\r\nnot to be applied to Solomon, or to Captain Corbet. They tried to coax\r\nthese, and persuade them.\r\n\r\nSolomon, however, was obdurate.\r\n\r\n“My ’vice to you, boys, an you, in tiklar, mas’r Bart,” said he, “is\r\nto clar out ob dis yer sinkin schooner, ef yer don want to git a duckin\r\nob de wustest sort. She’s a goin down--you’d betta believe--dat’s so.”\r\n\r\n“O, come, come, Solomon; we can’t wait. You’re making us all risk our\r\nlives,” said Bart, imploringly, coaxing him as he would coax an insane\r\nman. “Come along; don’t keep us here. The schooner’ll sink and drag the\r\nboat down, if we don’t keep farther away.”\r\n\r\n“Darsn’t,” said Solomon. “Couldn’t, darsn’t--no how.”\r\n\r\n“O, come.”\r\n\r\n“Darsn’t--fraid ob dat ar ole woman, wid de broomstick, de tongs, de\r\nfence-pole, an de red-hot gridiron. Tell you what, it stings--it does,\r\ndreadful--it does so--”\r\n\r\n“O, come. She shall never trouble you. Never.”\r\n\r\n“Who’s to go skewrity for dat ar statement? Nobody can skewer her. No.\r\nBetter be drown-ded, dan walloped to def with hay-forks. Nobody can\r\nskewer dat ar ole woman, dough; gracious sakes, she knows how to skewer\r\nme ebery time she lay hand on a pitchfork or a meat-skewer. Yah, yah,\r\nyah!”\r\n\r\nAt this ill-timed levity Bart and the others turned away in despair and\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\nThey hurried aft.\r\n\r\nThere stood the venerable Corbet. As they drew near he gave a start, and\r\na smile came over his reverend countenance.\r\n\r\n“Wal, boys,” said he, in a tone of kindly welcome, “how d’ye do? Pleased\r\nto see you.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke precisely as if he was receiving a call from some favorite\r\nguests. The tone pained the boys, and distressed them greatly.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Bruce, hurriedly, “the Antelope’s sinking. A moment more\r\nand you’ll be lost. Come with us in the boat. Come.”\r\n\r\nAnd, laying his hand on the captain’s arm, he sought to drag him away.\r\n\r\nBut the captain quietly though firmly, disengaged himself.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, young sir,” said the venerable navigator, very politely;\r\n“but I’m captain of this here craft; an, being sich, I ain’t got no call\r\nto leave her till the last man. You git to your boat, an I’ll retire\r\nwhen the time comes.”\r\n\r\nThe captain spoke with dignity. He announced a principle which involves\r\nthe highest duty of every commander of a ship, and the boys knew it. His\r\ndignity overawed them.\r\n\r\n“But come now, captain,” said Bart, “there isn’t a moment to lose.”\r\n\r\n“I ain’t, a goin ever to hev it written on my tume,” said the captain,\r\nin a calm voice, “that me--Captain Corbet--ever desarted his post, or\r\nforgot his umble dooty as commander of a vessel. No, the Antelope’ll see\r\nthat, her captain’s jist as much principle an honor as any of them\r\nswell navigators that sail in clipper ships over the boosom of the briny\r\ndeep.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a long-drawn, bubbling, gurgling sound,\r\nthat came up from the hold of the Antelope, and startled the boys\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\n“Come, come, captain,” cried Bruce. “She’s sinking now. There isn’t a\r\nmoment to spare.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, boys, you jist hurry off into that thar boat, an don’t mind me. I\r\nknow my dooty. You can’t expect me to leave this here deck till the last\r\nman. It don’t signify argufyin. Hurry off.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was another sound; something between a gasp and a\r\ngurgle. It seemed like the death-rattle of the Antelope.\r\n\r\n“She’s going down, boys!” cried Bart. Involuntarily they retreated\r\ntowards the boat. But here they paused yet again, for there was a brief\r\nrespite, and the Antelope was yet afloat.\r\n\r\n“Won’t you come, captain?” cried Bart.\r\n\r\n“O, all right,” said Captain Corbet, waving his hand; “all right. You\r\njest get aboard the boat. Don’t you mind me. Remember, I’m the captain,\r\nan I’ve got to be the last man.”\r\n\r\nThis seemed to the boys like a promise to follow them.\r\n\r\n“Come along, boys,” said Bart. “He’ll get into the boat if we do. He\r\nwants to be last.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, the three boys clambered over the Antelope’s side, and it\r\nwas with a feeling of relief that they found themselves once more in the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\n“Now, captain,” cried Bruce, “hurry up. Come, Solomon. Captain, make\r\nSolomon come on board, and then you’ll be the last man.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet smiled, and made no reply. As for Solomon, he merely\r\nmuttered something about “dat ar ole woman” and “gridiron.”\r\n\r\nThe Antelope was low in the water. The deck was near the level of the\r\nsea. Instinctively, Tom, who was holding the rail, pushed away, and the\r\nboat moved off a little distance. Yet they could not leave those two\r\ninfatuated men to their fate, though the instinct of self-preservation\r\nmade them thus move away slightly.\r\n\r\n“Captain! Solomon! Captain! Solomon! Make haste! O, make haste!” Such\r\nwere the cries that now came from those in the boat.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet smiled as before, and nodded, and said,--\r\n\r\n“O, it’s all right; all right. Don’t mind me. I’m all right. I know what\r\nI’m about.”\r\n\r\nAt this the Antelope gave a very unpleasant roll, and settled heavily on\r\none side; then her bows sank down, and a big wave rolled over it.\r\n\r\n“She’s sinking!” cried Tom, in a voice of horror. The other boys were\r\nsilent. They seemed petrified.\r\n\r\nBut the Antelope struggled up, and gradually righted herself. Her deck\r\nwas nearer the level of the sea than ever. This last incident, however,\r\nhad been sufficient to shake the nerves of one of those two on board.\r\nAs she settled on one side, Solomon sprang back, and, as the wave rolled\r\nover her bows, he gave one jump over the side and into the sea. He sank\r\nunder, but a moment afterwards his woolly head emerged, and he struck\r\nout for the boat. There a dozen arms were outstretched to save him, and\r\nhe was finally hauled in.\r\n\r\n“Drefful times dese,” said he, as his teeth chattered, either from\r\nterror or from cold. “Drefful times. Didn’t ’gage in dis yer vessel to\r\ngo swim-min about de Atlantic Oceum. Queer way to serve as cook--dis yer\r\nway. An dar ain’t a dry stitch ob clothin about--dat’s so; an what ebber\r\nI’se a goin to do beats me. S’pose I’se got to set here an shibber de\r\nnext tree weeks. Catch me ebber a ’barkin aboard sieh a schooner as\r\ndis yer. Any ways, I ain’t goin to sail in dis yer Antelope agin. Cotch\r\nme at it--dat’s all.”\r\n\r\nBut the boys heard nothing of this.\r\n\r\nAll their attention was now taken up with Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\nHe stood at the stern at his usual post, holding the tiller with both\r\nhands. He looked at the boys. “Boys,” said he, “I’m the last aboard.”\r\n\r\n“O, Captain Corbet! Come, come. Make haste!” they cried.\r\n\r\nHe shook his venerable head.\r\n\r\n“This here,” said he, “boys, air the act an the doin of Fate. I did hope\r\nthat the Antelope an me’d grow old, an finally die together, though\r\nnot on the briny deep. It hev allus ben a favorite idee to me, that the\r\nlives of both of us, me and the Antelope, was kine o’ intermingled, an\r\nthat as we’d ben lovely an pleasant in our lives, in death we’d be not\r\ndivided. For the Antelope an me’s knowed each other long, an lived, an\r\nben happy together, in fair weather an foul. The Antelope’s allus ben\r\nfaithful and terew. She’s had all my confidences. She’s alius been\r\ngentle an kind, and you’ll never, never find a better friend than the\r\nold Antelope. Many’s the time she’s bore me through sleet an snow.\r\nMany’s the time she’s borne me through fog an rain. Many’s the time\r\nshe’s bore me past rocks an reefs. So long as I stuck to old Fundy, so\r\nlong the Antelope was safe an sound. I used to boast as to how I could\r\nnavigate old Fundy. I was wrong. ’Twan’t me; it was the Antelope\r\nthat navigated; for I never had a sexton aboard, nor a quadruped, nor a\r\nspy-glass, nor any of them newfangled gimcracks, savin an except a real\r\nold-fashioned, apostolic compass, as is mentioned by Paul in the Acts.\r\nAnd why? Why, cos the Antelope was allus able to feel her own way\r\nthrough rain an fog, an frost an snow--past shoals, an flats, an reefs,\r\nan was alius faithful. But, in a evil hour, I took her out of her native\r\nwaters. I led her afar over the deep blue sea, up to the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence. There our woes began. But even there the Antelope was terew\r\nan tender. But it was too much. We come back. She had never ben thar\r\nbefore. She lost her way. Then she found it. We got to Sable Island an\r\nChester. Then we put out agin. An then agin she lost her way. It was my\r\nfault, not hern. She lost her way in this fog, an she went aground. She\r\ncouldn’t help it. In Fundy she never ran aground, ’cept when nessary;\r\nan it was me that brought her to this. An now what hev I got to do? I’ve\r\ngot this to do--that if I’ve led my Antelope to ruin, I won’t survive\r\nher. No. We’ve been lovely an pleasant in our lives, an in death we\r\nain’t goin to be divided.”\r\n\r\nThe boys did not hear one half of this, but interrupted the speaker\r\nconstantly with their entreaties that he would save himself. Captain\r\nCorbet, however, was too much taken up with his own thoughts to notice\r\nwhat they said. He was like one who soliloquizes.\r\n\r\n“O, captain!” cried Bart, with a final effort; “think of your\r\nwife--think of your, your, a--baby--”\r\n\r\n“My babby!” said Captain Corbet. “My babby! Ah, young sir, when you\r\nmention my babby, you don’t know that you tetch a cord in this parentual\r\nheart that throbs responsive. That thar is the strongest emotion that\r\ninspires this aged breast; but, young sir, dooty air powerfuller than\r\nlove, an even that pe-recious infant has less claims on me at this\r\nmoment than my Antelope. For my Antelope has ben the friend that’s ben\r\nfaithful in thousand perls; that’s ben my refuge an my solace in times\r\nof persecution. Yes, young sirs, in the days when a bold an violent\r\nwoman disturbed my peace, by dash-in a pail full of cold water over my\r\nhead--at such times the Antelope hav took me to her heart; an can I ever\r\ncease to be affectionate an kind to thee, who’s ben so terewly kind to\r\nme--my Antelope? No, no; young sirs. Go, an tell my beloved one--my\r\noffspring--my inspired babby--that his parent, the aged Corbet, died a\r\nmarchure’s death; died like a hero, a standin’ at his post; which post\r\nwas the rudder-post of the Antelope. Tell him that; an tell him, tew,\r\nthat, though dooty bound the feyther to the Antelope, yet still that\r\nfeyther’s last thoughts was of his belessed babe.”\r\n\r\nAt this point the Antelope gave another lurch, and rolled far over.\r\nCaptain Corbet stopped abruptly, and stiffened his sinews, and clutched\r\nthe tiller with a tighter grasp. The boys looked on with horror in their\r\nfaces and in their hearts.\r\n\r\nIt was a moment of awful expectation.\r\n\r\nThey had cried, and bawled, and yelled till they were hoarse. They had\r\nprayed and entreated Captain Corbet to save himself. All in vain.\r\n\r\nBut now the time for entreaty had passed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Antelope rolled back, and then her bows sank. A huge wave\r\nrolled over her, followed by others, which foamed from bow to stern.\r\nThen all the sea settled itself over the sinking schooner.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope was going down!\r\n\r\nThe hull disappeared!\r\n\r\nThe rail sank under water!\r\n\r\nBut Captain Corbet stood at his post, erect, rigid, his hands clasping\r\nthe tiller. Beneath him the Antelope sank down into the sea. Around him\r\nthe waters rolled.\r\n\r\nThey rolled about his knees; about his thighs; about his waist. His\r\nvenerable hair fluttered in the breeze; his eyes were fixed, with a rapt\r\nand abstracted air, on vacancy.\r\n\r\nThe boys looked on in horror. Instinctively they pushed the boat back\r\nout of the reach of the waters that ingulfed the Antelope, so as to\r\navoid being carried down into that vortex.\r\n\r\nThe waters rolled about the form of the aged navigator, and so he\r\ndescended with his beloved Antelope, till they were above his waist.\r\n\r\nThe boys could no longer cry to him. They were petrified with horror.\r\nThey sat, with white faces, awaiting the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\n_Watching with pallid Faces.--The Torso of Corbet.--A sudden and\r\nunaccountable Break in the Proceedings.--Great Reaction.--Unpleasant\r\nDiscovery.--Pat and the salt Water.--The Rheu-matiz and kindred\r\nDiseases.--Where to go.--Where are we?--Sable Island.--Anticosti,\r\nBermuda, Jamaica, Newfoundland, Cape Cod, or Owld Ireland.--A land\r\nBreeze.--Sounding for the Land.--Land ahead._\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINFUL thing it was to see the Antelope thus sinking into the sea; to\r\nview the waters thus rolling over her familiar form from bows to stern;\r\nto see the boiling foam of the ingulfing billows; but how much more\r\nterrible it was to see the sacrifice of a human life; the voluntary\r\nself-destruction of a human being, and of one, too, who had been\r\ntheir guide, their revered and beloved friend! They had no cause for\r\nself-reproach. They had done all that they could. His own will had\r\nbrought him to this. Still the spectacle was no less terrible to all of\r\nthem, and there was no less anguish in their souls as they saw him,--the\r\nmeek, the gentle, the venerable Corbet,--thus descending, by his own\r\nfree will, and by his own act, into the dark abyss of this unknown sea.\r\n\r\nAnd so they watched with pallid faces, and with angonized hearts for the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThe ancient mariner sank down, as has been said, with his sinking\r\nschooner, and his feet were overwhelmed by the rushing flood, and his\r\nankles, and his knees, and his thighs, and at length he stood there with\r\nthe waters about his waist, and his mild eyes fixed upon vacancy.\r\n\r\nAnother moment, and they expected to see that venerable and beloved form\r\ndisappear forever from their gaze.\r\n\r\nBut that venerable form did not, in fact, disappear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0293]\r\n\r\nThat venerable form remained stationary,--the waters reaching as far\r\nas the waist: thus far, but no farther. The lower half had disappeared\r\nbeneath the sea, but the upper half still remained to bless and cheer\r\ntheir eyes. Corbet still lived! But it was what an artist might call a\r\nTorso of Corbet.\r\n\r\nCorbet thus had sunk into the unfathomable depth of ocean up to his\r\nwaist, but after that he sank no more. Higher than that the waters did\r\nnot rise. He stood in that rigid attitude already described, grasping\r\nthe tiller, and thus steadying himself,--upright, firm as a rock, and so\r\nhe stood after the waters had risen to his waist.\r\n\r\nThe hull of the Antelope had disappeared. But still her masts and\r\nrigging rose above the waters, and above the head of Corbet, and these\r\nsank no farther, but remained at the same height above the sea.\r\n\r\nAstonishment seized upon all of them, Corbet included. What was it that\r\nhad caused this wonder? Was it because the hull was too buoyant to sink\r\nany farther? Was it because there was still some air left inside the\r\nhull which prevented the schooner from sinking altogether? This they\r\nmight have thought had they not been made wiser through their recent\r\nexperiences. By these they now knew that on these seas there were sand\r\nbanks and shoals; and, therefore, what was more natural than that, the\r\nAntelope had sunk in some place where there happened to be, just beneath\r\nher, a convenient shoal which had received her sinking hull? It was\r\ncertainly a very curious sea,--a sea which seemed to abound in such\r\nshoals as these; but whatever might be the character of that sea, this\r\nfact remained, that the Antelope had sunk in less than a couple of\r\nfathoms of water.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that the heroic and devoted resolve of the venerable and\r\nhigh-minded captain was baffled, and his descent into the depths of the\r\nocean was arrested. For there lay the Antelope, resting upon some place\r\nnot far beneath the sea, with her masts still high above water, and with\r\nthe person of her gifted commander half submerged and half exposed to\r\nview; and there stood that venerable commander up to his waist in\r\nwater, but unable to descend any farther: a singular, a wonderful, an\r\nunparalleled spectacle; unaccountable altogether to those whose eyes\r\nwere fastened upon it.\r\n\r\nBut the thought of a shoal or sand bank soon came, and so they began\r\nto understand the state of affairs. The Antelope had sunk, not into an\r\nunfathomable abyss in mid-ocean, but upon some sand bank. Where or\r\nwhat that sand-bank might be, they did not then take time to consider.\r\nWhether it was some part of one of the Banks of Newfoundland, or the\r\nslowly declining shore around Sable Island, or some other far different\r\nand far removed place, did not at that time enter into the sphere of\r\ntheir calculations. Enough it was for them that the terror had passed;\r\nthat the grim spectacle of death and destruction before their very eyes\r\nhad been averted; that Corbet was saved.\r\n\r\nTill this moment they had not been aware of the greatness of their\r\nanguish. But now the reaction from that anguish made them acquainted\r\nwith its intensity, and in proportion to their late sufferings was now\r\ntheir joy and rejoicing. At the first movement of the Antelope towards\r\na descent into the sea, they had instinctively and very naturally moved\r\ntheir boat farther away, so as to avoid being sharers of the fate which\r\nCaptain Corbet seemed to desire; but now, after the first danger was\r\nover, and the first emotions of amazement and wonder had subsided, they\r\nrowed nearer. They believed that now Captain Corbet would listen to\r\nreason, and that, having done so much in obedience to the call of duty,\r\nhe would be willing to save himself.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as they rowed nearer, the boat floated over the rail of the\r\nsunken schooner, and came close up to the half-submerged commander.\r\n\r\n“Come, captain,” said Bart, in a voice that was yet tremulous with\r\nexcitement, “jump in. There’s plenty of room. You--you--don’t--don’t\r\nwant to be standing in the water this way any longer, of course.”\r\n\r\nTo this remark Captain Corbet made no reply in words, but he did make a\r\nreply in acts, which were far more eloquent. He seized the side of the\r\nboat at once, and scrambling in, sank down, wet and shivering, in the\r\nstern, alongside of those other obstinate and contumacious ones--Pat,\r\nWade, and Solomon. And so it was that at last, after so much trouble,\r\nthose four, who had at first been so unmanageable, now were assembled on\r\nboard the boat into which they had once refused to enter.\r\n\r\nThe delight of the boys was as great as their grief had been a short\r\ntime before, and no other thought came into their minds than that of the\r\nhappy end that had occurred to a scene that had promised such disaster.\r\nThe fact that their situation was one of doubt and uncertainty, perhaps\r\nperil, did not just then occur to them. It was enough joy for them that\r\nCaptain Corbet had been snatched from a watery grave; and so they now\r\nsurrounded him with careful attention. Bruce offered him a biscuit; Bart\r\nasked about his health; Tom urged him to wring out the water from his\r\ntrousers; and Phil, who was next to him in the boat, fearing that he\r\nmight feel faint, pressed upon him a tin dipper full of water.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet took the proffered draught and raised it to his lips.\r\nA few swallows, however, satisfied him, and he put it down with some\r\nappearance of haste.\r\n\r\n“As a general thing,” said he, in a tone of mild remonstrance, “I don’t\r\nuse sea water for a beverage. I kin take it, but don’t hanker arter it,\r\nas the man said when he ate the raw crow on a bet.”\r\n\r\n“Sea water!” exclaimed Phil. “Did I?”\r\n\r\nHe raised the water to his own lips, and found that it was so.\r\n\r\n“Then we’ve taken sea water in this keg,” he cried, “and we haven’t any\r\nfresh.”\r\n\r\nAt this dreadful intelligence consternation filled all minds.\r\n\r\n“Who filled that keg?” asked Bruce, after a long silence.\r\n\r\n“Sure I did,” said Pat.\r\n\r\n“You! and how did you happen to make such a mistake?” cried Bart.\r\n\r\n“Sure ye said to fill the kegs with wather, an didn’t say what kind; so\r\nI jist tuk the say wather, because it was most convaynient.”\r\n\r\nAt this amazing blunder the boys were dumb, and stared at Pat in\r\nsilence. Words were useless. The mistake was a fatal one. The fresh\r\nwater had gone with the Antelope to the bottom. Where or when could they\r\nhope to get any more? Who could tell how long a time, or how great\r\na distance, might now separate them from the land? Bad enough their\r\nsituation already had been, but this opened up before them the prospect\r\nof unknown sufferings.\r\n\r\n“O, don’t talk to me about water,” said Captain Corbet, in lugubrious\r\ntones, squeezing his hands, as he spoke, over his thighs and shins, so\r\nas to force the water out of his clothes. “Don’t you go and talk to me\r\nabout water. I’ve hed enough, an don’t want ever to see any agin. Why,\r\nit kem up as high as my waist if it kem a inch. An now what’s to hender\r\nme a fallin a helpuless victim to rheuma-tiz. O, I know it. Don’t tell\r\nme. I know what’s a goin to come to this ferrail body. Thar’s rheuma-tiz\r\nacute and chronic, an thar’s pleurisy, an thar’s lumbago, an thar’s\r\nnooralgy, an thar’s fifty other diseases equally agonizin. An dear,\r\ndear, dear, dear! But how dreadful wet it did feel, to be sure! dear,\r\ndear, dear, dear! An here am I now, with my tendency to rheumatiz, a\r\nsettin here in my wet clothes, an not a dry stitch to be had for love or\r\nmoney. Wal, I never knowed anythin like this here, an I’ve lived a life\r\nfull of sturrange vycissitudes--from bad to wuss has ben our fate ever\r\nsence we sot foot on this here eventfual vyge; an ef thar’s any lesson\r\nto be larned from sech doins an car’ns on as this here, why, I ain’t\r\nable to see it. An now what am I to do? What’s a goin to become of me?\r\nNo dry clothes! No fire to dry myself! Rheumatiz before me! lumbago\r\nbehind me! pleurisy on each side o’ me! such is the te-rific prospect of\r\nthe blighted bein that now addresses you.”\r\n\r\nThe boys paid but little attention to Captain Corbet’s wailings. They\r\nhad other troubles more serious than these prospective ones. They could\r\nnot help, however, being struck by the thought that it was a little odd\r\nfor a man who had just been snatched so narrowly from a terrible death\r\nto confine all his attention and all his lamentations to such a very\r\nordinary circumstance as wet clothes. He who had announced so firmly,\r\na short time before, his calm and fixed intention of perishing with the\r\nAntelope, now seemed to have forgotten all about her, and thought only\r\nof himself and his rheumatiz. Could this be, indeed, Captain Corbet?\r\nStrange was the change that had come over him; yet this was not the\r\nonly singular change that had occurred on this eventful day. They had\r\nwitnessed others quite as wonderful in Solomon and Pat. These two,\r\nhowever, had now resumed their usual characteristics.\r\n\r\nThere they were, in a boat, all of them, but where? That was the\r\nquestion. The masts of the sunken Antelope rose obliquely out of the\r\nwater, showing that she was resting on her side at the bottom. But what\r\nwas that bottom, and where? Was it some lonely rock or reef? Was it some\r\nsand-bank or shoal like that upon which they had already gone aground,\r\nand where the Antelope had received those injuries which had at length\r\nwrought her ruin? None of them could answer this.\r\n\r\nAnd where should they go? In what direction should they turn? This was\r\nthe question that pressed upon them, and required immediate decision.\r\n\r\n“It’s impossible to even guess where we are,” said Bart. “We’ve been\r\ngoing in the dark all along. We may as well be off Sable Island as\r\nanywhere else. And if so, all I can say is, I’ve seen worse places.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an thin it’s as likely to be Anticosti as Sable Island,” said\r\nPat. “We’ve ben a turrunin around ivery way, so we have, an we may have<\r\nfetched up there, so we may, an if that’s so, we may as well dig our\r\ngraves an lay ourselves down in thim.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you’re going so far as that,” said Bruce, “I’d put in a\r\nclaim for Bermuda. I don’t see why we mayn’t be off Bermuda as well as\r\nAnticosti. If so, we may be sure of good accommodations.”\r\n\r\n“Well, while you’re about it,” said Arthur, “why don’t you say Jamaica?”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Bruce, “I shouldn’t wonder if it should turn, out to\r\nbe Newfoundland. This sou’-west wind would take us there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but there’s been a calm,” said Arthur, “for some time, and we’ve\r\ngot into some current. I dare say it’s taken us west, and that this is\r\nclose by Cape Cod.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Phil. “If we’ve been drifting with any current, there’s\r\nonly one current hereabouts. That’s the Gulf Stream. I tell you what it\r\nis, boys; we’ve crossed the Atlantic, and this place is off the coast of\r\nOwld Ireland; and there ye have it.”\r\n\r\n“Arrah, go way wid yer deludherin talk,” said Pat. “We want a sinsible\r\nopinion.”\r\n\r\n“The more I think of it,” said Tom, “the more I’m inclined to be of\r\nBart’s opinion. We’ve been tacking and drifting, and going backward and\r\nforward, and it seems to me most likely that this is Sable Island. If\r\nso, we may be glad that we came here when the water was so calm.”\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, thoughtfully, “I don’t b’lieve that this\r\nhere air Ireland, nor Iceland, nor Africky, nor Jamaiky, nor any other\r\nsech. ’Tain’t unpossible for it to be Sable Island. We drifted there\r\nonst, an may heve done it agin. Far be it from me to dispute that thar.\r\nBut then again it might be Newfoundland. ’Pears to me as ef we’ve got\r\noff some land whar thar’s woods, for I got jest now a kine a scent o’\r\ntrees, an ’peared to me of spruce an sech. I shouldn’t be s’prised ef\r\nthe wind was to haul round. It often doos, specially when it’s ben an\r\ndone its wust, an you don’t care. So now we don’t care what it doos, or\r\nwhich way it blows; an consekently it’s goin to turn an blow away the\r\nfog.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment, and while the ancient mariner was yet speaking, there\r\ncame a breath of wind, very gentle, yet quite perceptible, and there\r\nwas in it an unmistakable odor of forest trees--balmy, delicious, most\r\nfragrant, bringing with it hope, and joy, and delight.\r\n\r\n“The land must be close by,” cried Bart. “Hurrah!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t hurrah too soon,” said Tom. “It may be Anticosti.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! Anticosti could never send out such a smell of spruce and pine.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it may be Newfoundland, and that won’t help us much.”\r\n\r\n“The wind’s going to change,” said Arthur. “I think the fog isn’t so\r\nthick as it was.”\r\n\r\n“Come, boys, this bottom shoals in some direction. Let’s sound, and row\r\non in the direction where it shoals. That’ll bring us to the shore.”\r\n This suggestion, which came from Bruce, was at once acted on. Bart and\r\nTom took the oars. Bruce took a hatchet which had been flung into the\r\nboat, and tying a line to it, used this as a sounding lead.\r\n\r\n“Row gently,” said he.\r\n\r\nThe boys did so, following Bruce’s direction, while, holding his\r\nsounding-line, he tested the bottom. After a little while he had\r\nsatisfied himself.\r\n\r\n“It shoals in this direction,” said he. “Row straight on a dozen\r\nstrokes.”\r\n\r\nThey did so.\r\n\r\nBruce sounded again.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said he. “Row on.”\r\n\r\nThey rowed farther.\r\n\r\nBruce sounded again. The bottom was much shallower.\r\n\r\nThey rowed farther.\r\n\r\nBut now no sounding was any longer necessary, for there, straight before\r\nthem, looming through the now lessening fog, they all descried the\r\nwelcome sight of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\n_Rowing ashore.--Nearer they come.--The Fog dispels.--Strangely\r\nfamiliar.--A Man advances towards them.--Wild Shouts from Bart and\r\nTom.--Wilder Shouts from the other Boys.--Confused Rejoicings.--A\r\nhearty Welcome.--Explanations.--The receding Tide.--A Visit to the\r\nAntelope.--Mournful Remembrances.--The Speech of Captain Corbet._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE sight of land a cry of joy burst forth from all in the boat, and\r\nBart and Torn bent to their oars with all their force. As they drew\r\nnearer, they saw, to their intense delight, that this strange land\r\nwas no wilderness, no desolate shore, but an inhabited place, with\r\ncultivated fields, and pasture land, and groves. One by one, new\r\nfeatures in the landscape revealed themselves. There was a long beach,\r\nwith a grand sweep that curved itself away on either side, till it\r\njoined steep or precipitous shores. Behind this were fields, all green\r\nwith verdure, and a scattered settlement, whose white houses, of simple,\r\nyet neat construction, looked most invitingly to these shipwrecked\r\nwanderers. At one end of the winding beach rose the fabric of a large\r\nship in process of construction.\r\n\r\nNearer they came, and yet nearer. The tide was high on the beach, and\r\nthe waters almost touched the green fields that fringed the shore with\r\nalder bushes. Here a boat was drawn up, and beyond this stood a neat\r\nfarm-house. On a fence nets were hanging, showing that the occupant\r\nof this house united the two callings of farmer and fisher. Beyond\r\nthe settlement, the land rose into high hills, which were covered with\r\nforest trees, and from these had been wafted that aromatic breeze which\r\nhad first made known to them the neighborhood of land.\r\n\r\nAll this time the breeze had been slightly increasing, and the fog had\r\nbeen steadily diminishing. Now the shores appeared in fuller outline.\r\nLooking back over their course, they could see the masts of the\r\nAntelope, where they projected above the water. They could see that they\r\nhad drifted into a bay, and the Antelope had sunk into its shallowest\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThere was something in this scene which appeared to them strangely and\r\nmost unaccountably familiar. All had the same feeling, yet not one\r\nof them expressed it. Each imagined that it was his own fancy; and so\r\ndisturbed had their minds been for the past few days, that they felt\r\nunwilling now to indulge this fancy. Yet every moment the fancy grew\r\nstronger, and brought fresh wonder with it. In this way they rowed\r\nalong, and every moment brought the boat nearer and nearer to the shore.\r\n\r\nAt length they saw a man come forth from the house before them, and\r\nadvance towards the beach. His face was turned towards them; he was\r\nstaring at them most intently. As the boat advanced, he advanced; and\r\nthus the two parties approached. Every moment revealed more and more of\r\nthe opposite party to each.\r\n\r\nBart and Tom were rowing, and thus had their backs turned to the\r\nshore and their faces towards the sea outside. Here the fog was fast\r\ndispelling, and as it fled, there opened up mile after mile of the\r\ncoast, and the sea horizon. There, on that horizon, there came forth out\r\nof the fog to their eyes a solitary object, that appeared to float upon\r\nthe sea. It revealed itself more and more; and first, magnified and\r\ndistorted by the mist, it seemed like a lofty table land of cloud, then\r\nlike a giant rock, but at length resolved itself into a wooded island\r\nwith precipitous sides. There it lay full before them.\r\n\r\nAs it thus revealed itself, Tom uttered a wild shout. Bart instantly\r\nuttered another.\r\n\r\n“Boys! Boys! Look! Look! Hurrah! Hur-ra-a-a-a-a-a-ah!\r\nHurra-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah!”\r\n\r\nBut at that very instant there arose a wild outcry--a clamor worse than\r\ntheirs--from all the others in the boat. Solomon gave a yell, Captain\r\nCorbet started up, and ceased to stroke his legs Bruce, Arthur, Phil,\r\nand Pat, with one wild cry, started erect to their feet, regardless\r\nof the swaying and rocking of the boat. And “Hurrah!” they cried.\r\n“Hurra-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah!! Hurra-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah!”\r\n\r\n“Scott’s Bay! Ile Haute!” cried Tom and Bart.\r\n\r\n“Scott’s Bay! Benny Grigg!” cried all the others.\r\n\r\n“Scott’s--Grigg.”\r\n\r\n“Benny-Haute.”\r\n\r\n“Ile-Bay.”\r\n\r\n“Benny-Bay.”\r\n\r\n“Ile-Grigg.”\r\n\r\n“Scott’s Haute.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the medley of cries that arose from all, shouting and yelling\r\nat once. While all the time there stood on the shore the man that\r\nhad come down to meet them; who first had started and stared with\r\namazement,--and who then, recognizing them all, and seeing the masts of\r\nthe sunken schooner beyond, understood the whole situation, and rejoiced\r\nover it accordingly--showing his joy, indeed, in a less noisy and\r\ndemonstrative manner than theirs, but in a way which was thoroughly\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nFor Benny suddenly turned, and started off to the house on a full run.\r\nThen he disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe boat drew nearer, Benny appeared once more.\r\n\r\nThe boat touched the beach.\r\n\r\nAt that very instant Benny touched the beach also, and, plunging into\r\nthe water, began shaking hands with every one of them, in the most\r\nviolent and vehement manner.\r\n\r\n“Come along! Come along! Come right up! Come along! Don’t mind the boat.\r\nI’ll see to that. Come along to the house. Blowed if I ever see the\r\nlikes o’ this in all my born days! Come along!”\r\n\r\nSuch was the welcome of Benny Grigg.\r\n\r\nAnd in this way Benny dragged them all up to his house. Here he gave\r\nthem another welcome, characterized by a lavish hospitality, and a\r\nwarmhearted friendliness that was truly delightful to his guests; in all\r\nof which he was seconded by Mrs. Benny. The table that was spread before\r\nthem was loaded down with everything that the house could furnish, and\r\nthe shipwrecked guests ate with an appetite such as is only known to\r\nthose who have labored hard and fasted long.\r\n\r\nAfter which Benny questioned them all closely, and made them tell him\r\nhow it was that they had come here. Great was his astonishment, but\r\ngreater still his amusement. Though it had so nearly been a tragedy, to\r\nhear it seemed like a comedy. There is but one step between the sublime\r\nand the ridiculous--the terrible and the grotesque--tragedy and comedy.\r\nBenny chose to regard it all from the lighter point of view, and\r\naccordingly he laughed with unrestrained hilarity, and made merry with\r\nexceeding mirth.\r\n\r\nBut after the story was all told, he grew more serious, and, producing a\r\nwell-worn chart, he explained to them his theory as to their wanderings.\r\nHe pointed out to them the probable place where the Antelope had struck,\r\ndescribed the character of the tides and currents, and showed how it\r\nwas that, with such a wind, and under such circumstances, they, very\r\nnaturally, had drifted into this particular part of the Bay of Fundy.\r\nBenny’s explanation was indeed so very lucid, and so satisfactory, that\r\nthey all expressed their regrets at not having known this before, in\r\nwhich case they would have been saved from much anxiety.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Scott’s Bay it was high tide, but by the time that\r\nthey had finished their story and the conversation that had been caused\r\nby it, the tide was far down on the ebb. On going forth they could\r\nsee that the deck of the Antelope had been uncovered by the retreating\r\nwaters. In two or three hours more the tide would be at the lowest\r\nebb, and they could see that it would be possible for them to visit the\r\nsunken schooner. It lay about a mile away from the beach, between which\r\nand her there extended long mud flats, which could easily be traversed\r\nat low water.\r\n\r\nThey waited till the tide was low, and then they all walked down to her.\r\n\r\nThere she lay--the Antelope--the vessel that had carried them so far,\r\nthrough strange seas, amid so many dangers and perils--the vessel\r\nassociated with so many memories. They climbed on board. They saw\r\nthat her hold was still full of water; for, though the crevices were\r\nnumerous, and wide enough to let in the sea, they could not let it out\r\nwith sufficient rapidity to keep pace with the fall of the tide. Still,\r\nthe water streamed out in small jets, or trickled out, drop by drop,\r\nin a hundred places, affording them a very impressive sight of the true\r\ncondition of the Antelope, and of the danger against which they had\r\nstruggled so long and so laboriously.\r\n\r\n“If the water’d ony get out of her,” said Captain Corbet, in a\r\nmelancholy voice, “she might float ashore.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Benny, “she might float, perhaps, as far as the shore, but\r\nno farther. ’Tain’t no manner of uthly use a tryin to repair that\r\nthar craft, cos she’s ben an gone an got done for. She’s wore out, the\r\nwustest kind. That thar vessel ain’t wuth a tryin to repair her. It’s\r\na mussy she held out so long, an didn’t go to pieces all of a suddent,\r\nsome-whars in the middle of the sea.”\r\n\r\nTo this Captain Corbet made no reply. He felt keenly the truth of the\r\nremark, and could see that the Antelope was indeed beyond the reach of\r\nhuman aid.\r\n\r\nThe boys all climbed on board of the beloved, though battered old craft,\r\nto take a last look and a last farewell. It was with unconcealed sadness\r\nthat they looked around. They could not go down into the cabin, or the\r\nhold, for the water was there; yet the deck was enough to remind them\r\nof that eventful past which they had experienced here. This was the\r\nschooner that had borne them on their cruise around Minas Bay; which\r\nhad taken them around the Bay of Fundy when Tom was lost; which had\r\nafterwards taken them to the Bay de Chaleur. This was the schooner\r\nfor whose appearance they had so watched and waited on board the\r\nwater-logged Petrel, and which had lately borne them over so many miles\r\nof watery sea, through so many leagues of fog. And this was the end.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet it was that first broke the solemn silence.\r\n\r\n“It air gone,” he said; “the derream hev bust! The berright derream\r\nof fortin, of wealth, an of perosperity. Gone, tew, air the ole\r\nAntelope--companion of my toils, my feelins, an my fame. Boys, you hev\r\nben the confidants of my feelins towards this here Antelope, an knows\r\nhow I loved her, yea, even as the apple of my aged eye! I stood here,\r\nnot long sence, by yon rudder, fixed firm an solemn; resolved to perish\r\nwith her; ready to sink into the deep blue sea. From that fate I was\r\nspared; yet still my feelins air the same; the heart’s the same--‘twill\r\nne’er grow cold. An now I feel to mourn. I feel that I am indeed a\r\ngrowin old. The days of my navigatin air brought to an end. Henceforth\r\nthe briny deep will be traversed by the aged Corbet no more forever.\r\nFrom this time I retire from the heavin biller, an take refooge in my\r\nown vine an fig tree. My navigatin arter this’ll be, with my belessed\r\nbabby in my arms, up an down the room. The only storms that await me\r\nnow, an the only squalls, air to be of a sterictly domestic characture.\r\nWeak human natur, boys, might be tempted to repine, an to indulge in\r\nvain lamintations over this here; but the time hev passed. I’ve made my\r\nlamintation, an that’s enough. I’ll lament no more. Peace to her ashes.\r\nLet her lie, an may no rude hand go a disturbin of the beloved Antelope\r\nin her last restin-place. Let her lie buried here beneath the ocean. Let\r\nthe billowy main sound her requem, an chant her foon’ral dirge. An now,\r\nfarwell! an may you be happy! Good by, Antelope--ole friend--an receive,\r\nas your last legacy an benediction, the belessin of the mournful\r\nCorbet!”\r\n\r\nHe ceased. Silence followed, and in that silence they all retired from\r\nthe Antelope, and returned to the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\n_Discussing the Situation.--By Land or by Sea.--Conferences with\r\nBennie.--The Offer of Bennie.--The last Meal at Scoffs Bay.--The Boat\r\nis on the Shore, and the Bark is on the Sea.--Last Words of Solomon, and\r\nFarewell Speech of the Ancient Mariner._\r\n\r\n\r\nON reaching the shore they found it necessary to take into\r\nconsideration the course of action that was now most advisable.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got a few weeks yet of vacation, boys,” said Bart, “and if\r\nwe want to enjoy ourselves, we’d better get out of this as fast as\r\npossible.”\r\n\r\n“We ought, at any rate, to write to our fathers and mothers,” said Phil;\r\n“I don’t know what they’ll think.”\r\n\r\n“Write!” said Bruce; “we’d better hurry off home our own selves, and not\r\nsend letters. For my part, I’m ready to start off this evening for Grand\r\nPré.”\r\n\r\n“Grand Pré? But why Grand Pré?” asked Arthur. “O, I don’t know,” said\r\nBruce: “what other way is there to go? We’ll have to get away from this,\r\nof course; and it seems most natural to cross the mountain to Grand Pré,\r\nand then go on by stage. Bart could leave us at Windsor, and take the\r\nsteamer for St. John.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an the stage goes the other way altogether,” said Pat.\r\n\r\n“How’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Why, down the valley to Annapolis; an the steamer starts from that to\r\nSt. John, so it does; an’ it’s twice as near, so it is.”\r\n\r\n“No, it isn’t.”.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is. St. John is only sixty mile from Annapolis, and it’s more’n\r\na hundred an twinty from Windsor.”\r\n\r\n“But Annapolis is seventy or eighty miles from this place, and Windsor’s\r\nonly thirty.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate, it’s easier goin by the way of Annapolis.”\r\n\r\n“No, it isn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is; you go down the valley, so you do, an the other way you\r\nhave to go up.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! nonsense! The Annapolis valley isn’t a hill. The fact is, from\r\nhere to St. John it’s easier to go by the way of Windsor.”\r\n\r\n“It’s further thin--.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Phil, “it’s a hundred and fifty miles by the way of Windsor,\r\nand only a hundred and forty-seven by the way of Annapolis.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Bart, “I don’t fancy either way. What’s the use of\r\ntalking about a hundred and fifty miles, when you need only go half that\r\ndistance?”\r\n\r\n“Half that distance? How?”\r\n\r\n“Why, across the bay.”\r\n\r\n“Across the bay? O! Why, that completely alters the case,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, but how can we go on fut across the bay? or by stage?” objected\r\nPat.\r\n\r\n“There don’t seem to be any schooner here,” said Arthur, looking all\r\naround.\r\n\r\nAll the others did the same, searching narrowly the whole line of coast.\r\nNothing, however, was visible of the nature of a vessel. Boats there\r\nwere, however, in plenty, quite commodious too, but none of them\r\nsufficiently large to take them so far as St. John.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid, Bart, your idea of getting to St. John by water won’t do,”\r\n said Bruce. “You’d better make up your mind to come along with us.”\r\n\r\n“O, I’ll go, of course, along with you; we must stick together as long\r\nas we can; but we must settle, first of all, which is the best way to\r\ngo. You’ll find it most convenient to come to St. John. You can go from\r\nthere up the bay, and then go over to Prince Edward Island, easier than\r\nby any other route.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know but that we can, at least as easy as any other way,\r\nand so I’ve no objection; but won’t it be best to go to Windsor, or, if\r\nyou prefer it, to Annapolis?”\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s find out, first of all, whether there is any chance of\r\ngoing by a more direct way. Old Bennie can tell us all about it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said Tom, who had thus far taken no part in the discussion,\r\n“let’s ask old Bennie; he can tell us what’s best to do.”\r\n\r\nWith these words the boys walked on faster towards where old Bennie was\r\nsauntering about with Captain Corbet and Solomon. At the first mention\r\nof their wish Bennie energetically refused to say anything about it.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got to stay here, boys--you’ve got to, you know; an thar’s no\r\nuse talkin, an that’s all about it--thar now.”\r\n\r\nThis the good Bennie said over and over again, persisting in it most\r\nobstinately. At length Bart managed to secure his attention long enough\r\nto convey to him an idea of the circumstances in which they were, and\r\nespecially the regard which they had for their respective parents. At\r\nthe mention of this Bennie’s obstinacy gave away.\r\n\r\n“Wal, thar,” boys, said he, “that thar does knock me, an I give up. The\r\nfact is, when I regard you, and think on what you’ve ben a doin on,\r\nan how you’ve ben adoin of it, an what sort of a craft you’ve ben a\r\nnavigatin in, I feel as though the parients an guardins of sech as youns\r\nhad ort to be pitied.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, Bennie’s commiseration for these anxious parents was so great\r\nthat he changed his tactics at once, and instead of trying to keep\r\nthe boys with him, he exhibited the utmost eagerness to hasten their\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n“You can’t go straight off to St. John, boys, from this place, for there\r\nain’t a schooner in jest now; but there’s a way of goin that’ll take you\r\nto that place faster, mebbe, than you could go if you went direct in\r\na sailin craft. It’s to get off to the nighest place where the steamer\r\ntouches.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Parrsboro’.”\r\n\r\n“Parrsboro’? and how far is it?”\r\n\r\n“O, only a few miles; it’s only jest round thar;” and Bennie swung\r\nhis arm round over towards the right, indicating a vast extent of the\r\nearth’s surface.\r\n\r\n“O, we all know Parrsboro’ perfectly well,” said Bart; “but when can we\r\ncatch the steamer there?”\r\n\r\n“Why, to-morrow, some time, at about half tide. The steamer comes up\r\nto-night, and goes down tomorrow. So, if you go to Parrsboro’ an take\r\nthe steamer thar, you’ll be able to be in St. John quicker than if you\r\nwent any other way.”\r\n\r\nThis intelligence at once settled the question completely. They all\r\nsaw that to go by land part of the way would take up much longer time.\r\nParrsboro’ was so near that it needed only to be mentioned for them all\r\nto adopt at once this plan. The only question now remaining was how to\r\nget there.\r\n\r\n“Wal, there ain’t no trouble about that,” said Bennie. “Thar’s my\r\nboat--a nice, clean, roomy one; and I’ll engage to put you over in\r\nParrsboro’ quick sticks. ’Tain’t big enough, quite, to take you to St.\r\nJohn; not because she couldn’t go there, for I’d a precious sight sooner\r\ncross the bay--yes, or the Atlantic Ocean--in her than in that old\r\nAntelope; but because she hain’t got good sleepin accommodations in\r\ncase we was to be delayed, as would be very probable. She’s ony an open\r\nboat--a beautiful one for sailin in by day, an in fine weather, but\r\nnot overly good for long vyges for reasons above mentioned, as you’ll\r\nobserve, young gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n“And can we get over there to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, let me see. The tide’s a leetle agin us, but bein as you’re\r\nanxious, I don’t know but what we might do it. There ain’t much wind\r\nabout, an we may have to pull a bit; but we’ll do what we can, an then,\r\nyou know, we’ve got all night afore us. Even at the wust we’re sure to\r\nget to Parrs-boro’ before the steamer doos; for if the tide’s too much\r\nfor us we can wait till it turns, and then go up with the flood. An so,\r\nif you’re bound to be off, why, here am I, in good order and condition,\r\nan at your service.”\r\n\r\nBennie now led the way to his boat, which was drawn up on the beach. It\r\nwas an open fishing boat of large size, with one mast and sail. It was,\r\nas Bennie had said, quite clean and comfortable, and afforded a very\r\npleasant mode of dropping over to the Parrsboro’ shore. Having once\r\nseen the boat, the boys were now all eager to be off. Bennie, however,\r\ninsisted on their taking their dinner before starting. This they all\r\nconsented to do very readily. The dinner was almost ready, and Bennie\r\nprepared for the voyage, which preparation consisted chiefly in moving\r\nthe boat down over the beach to the water, which was some distance away.\r\n\r\nThen followed the dinner, which was served up in the usual sumptuous\r\nstyle peculiar to Mrs. Bennie, After this followed a kindly farewell\r\nto their motherly hostess, and the boys followed Bennie to the beach,\r\naccompanied by the venerable Corbet and the aged Solomon.\r\n\r\nIt had been no slight task to move the heavy boat from the place where\r\nshe had been lying all the way down to the water, for the tide was\r\nquite low, and the space intervening was considerable; but Bennie had\r\naccomplished the task with the help of some of his neighbors, and the\r\nboat now lay so that a slight push might suffice to set her afloat; and\r\ninside were some provisions prepared by the forethought of Mrs. Bennie,\r\ntogether with some wraps put there with an eye to some sudden assault\r\nof the fog. Everything was, therefore, very well ordered to secure the\r\ncomfort of the travellers.\r\n\r\nOn the way to the boat the venerable Corbet and the aged Solomon were\r\nsilent, and appeared overcome with emotion. This silence was first\r\nbroken by Solomon.\r\n\r\n“Tell ye what, chilen,” said he; “it am drefful hard for a ’fectionate\r\nole nigga like me to hab to undergo dis yer operatium. Can’t stan it,\r\nno how; an donno what on erf I’se a gwine to do. Here I ben a romin ober\r\nthe mighty oceam, feelin like de father an garden ob all of youns; and\r\nnow it ’mos stracts dis yer ole nigga to tar his sef away. Blest if I\r\nain’t like to break down like a chicken; an I ain’t got nuffin else to\r\ndo. Darsen’t go on wid you, Mas’r Bart--darsen’t, no how. Braid ob\r\ndat ar ole woman wid de gridiron. De aged Solomon hab got to become a\r\npilgrin an awander on de face ob de erf. But I ain’t gwine to wander yet\r\na while; I pose to make a bee-line for de Cad’my. I hab a hope dat\r\nde ole ’oman hab not got dar; an if so I be safe, an tany rate de\r\ndoctor’ll take her in hand--he’s de boy--dat ar’s de identical gemman\r\ndat kin overhaul her an teach her her ‘p’s’ an ‘q’s.’ But what you’ll\r\ndo, chilen, widout me to cook, and to carve, an to car for you, am more\r\ndan I can magine. Ony I truss we’m boun to meet agin afore long, an jine\r\nin de social band; an so you won’t forgit ole Solomon.”\r\n\r\nThe boys all shook him warmly by the hand, advising him to go by all\r\nmeans back to the Academy, and put himself at once under the protection\r\nof the doctor, who would defend him from all possible dangers arising\r\nout of his “ole ’oman.”\r\n\r\nThe mate, Wade, also received their farewells.\r\n\r\nThus far the venerable Corbet had been a mute spectator; his heart was\r\nfull; his mind seemed preoccupied; he seemed to follow mechanically. At\r\nlast he saw the moment come which must once more sever him from them,\r\nand with a long breath he began to speak.\r\n\r\n“It air seldom, young sirs,” said he, “that I am called on to experience\r\na sensation sich as that which this moment swells this aged boosom; an\r\nI feel that this is one of the most mournful moments of my checkered\r\ncareer. Thar’s a sadness, an a depression, an a melancholy, sich as\r\nI’ve seldom knowed afore. Tain’t altogether the loss of the friend of\r\nmy youth. That air passed and gone--‘tis o’er. I’ve met that grief an\r\nsurmounted him. But it was a sore struggle, and the aged Corbet ain’t\r\nthe man he once was. Consequently, I’m onmanned; I’m all took aback.\r\nIt’s this here separation, boys dear, comin as it doos, hard an fast on\r\nthe heels of the great calamity of the loved and lost Antelope. But\r\nit’s got to be.”--He paused and sighed heavily. “Yes,” he continued,\r\npensively, “it’s got to be. You ain’t my sons; you’ve got parients\r\nan gardens that’s anxious about you an wants to see you, and no doubt\r\nhain’t got that confidence in me which they might have in some. But go\r\nyou, boys dear, and tell all them parients an gardens that there ain’t a\r\npang, an there ain’t a emotion, an there ain’t a anxiety, an there ain’t\r\na grief that they’ve ever had for any of you that I haven’t had for\r\nevery one of you. Tell them that there ain’t a tear that they’ve shed\r\nover you, but I’ve shed too: an there ain’t a sigh they’ve heaved what\r\nI haven’t heaved, and ain’t a groan they’ve groaned that I ain’t groaned\r\ntoo. Tell them that Corbet, with all his faults, loves you still, an\r\nthat if you run into dangers and trials, thar wan’t a moment when he\r\nwouldn’t hev shed his heart’s blood to get you off safe and clear. Don’t\r\nlet em run away with the idee that I’m a stony-hearted monster that’s\r\nben a endangerin of your lives in divers places. I’m ready to be blamed\r\nfor carless-ness an ignorance, boys dear, but not for lack of affection.\r\nYou know it, an I know that you know it, an what I want is for you all\r\nto make them know it too. For, boys dear, I’m a father, an I know a\r\nfather’s heart, an I wouldn’t have the heart of any father made bitter\r\nagainst me.”\r\n\r\nHow long the venerable navigator would have gone on talking, it is\r\nimpossible to say; indeed, it seemed now as if, after his long silence,\r\nhis tongue, having once found voice, had become endowed with perpetual\r\nmotion, and was ready to wag forever. But Bennie Grigg put on a stopper,\r\nand abruptly interrupted.\r\n\r\n“All right, all right, my hearty,” said he; “I’ll engage that they’ll do\r\nall that; but thar ain’t no time to lose; so tumble in, boys, tumble in,\r\nand let’s get off so as to round the pint an take the flood tide as it\r\nruns up.”\r\n\r\nUpon this the boys all shook hands hurriedly with Captain Corbet,\r\none after another, and then each one “tumbled” into the boat. Captain\r\nCorbet, thus suddenly silenced, remained silent as he seized each one’s\r\nhand. Then Bennie called upon him and Solomon to help him shove off the\r\nboat. Then Bennie jumped in and hoisted the sail. Then the boat moved\r\nslowly away, bearing the “B. O. W. C.” and their fortunes.\r\n\r\n“Good by, boys,” wailed Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n“Good by,” murmured the aged Solomon.\r\n\r\n“Good by! Good by!” cried all the boys.\r\n\r\n“We’ll meet soon,” said Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n“O, yes--in a few weeks,” cried Tom.\r\n\r\nAnd so with frequent good bys the boat moved slowly from the beach, and\r\nslowly passed over the water till the forms of the aged Solomon and the\r\nancient mariner were gradually lost to view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\n_A hard Pull.--Wind and Tide.--Bennie’s “Idee.”--Jolly under creditable\r\nCircumstances.--The Triple Promontory.--The Advance of the Fog.--The\r\nLine of Cliff.--The foaming Sea.--The slow Passage of the Hours.--The\r\nStrait of Minas.--Land at Last.--Bennie triumphant._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE tide was coming up; some time had elapsed since the Antelope had\r\nsunk, and it had sufficed for the ebb of the tide and its return to its\r\nflood. The wind also was light, and as they sought to get out of Scott’s\r\nBay, they had the tide against them, and very little wind to favor them.\r\nAt first they moved rather along the line of the shore than away from\r\nit, and though they lost sight of the figures on the beach, they did not\r\ntherefore make any very great progress.\r\n\r\nScott’s Bay is enclosed in a circle of land formed by the Nova Scotia\r\ncoast, which here rises high above the Bay of Fundy, and throws out a\r\nlong, circling arm, terminating in a rugged, storm-beaten, and sea-worn\r\ncrag, known as Cape Split. It was necessary to double this cape, and\r\nthen go up the Strait of Minas to Parrsboro’, which place was at the\r\nhead of the strait, inside Minas Basin, and rig opposite Cape Blomidon.\r\nIn order to do this, either the wind or the tide ought to favor the\r\nnavigator; but, unfortunately, on the present occasion, they were not\r\nthus favored.\r\n\r\n“I had an idee,” said Bennie, after a long silence, “I had an idee that\r\nthe wind would come up a leetle stronger out here, but it don’t seem to;\r\nan now I’ve a notion that it’s goin to turn. If so we’ll be delayed, but\r\nstill you’ll be landed in Parrsboro’ time enough to catch the steamer.\r\nOnly you may have to be longer gettin thar than you counted on.”\r\n\r\n“O, we don’t care. Only get us there in time for the steamer, and we\r\nwon’t complain.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, it’s best to make up one’s mind for the wust, you know. The wind\r\nmay change, an then we may be out half the night, or even all night.\r\nBut, at any rate, I’ll put you through.”\r\n\r\n“You needn’t think about any inconvenience to us. We’re only too\r\ngrateful to you for putting yourself out so much, and none of us would\r\ncare whether we were out all night or not. We’ve learned to rough it\r\nduring the last two or three weeks.”\r\n\r\nBennie now diverted his gaze to the surrounding sea, and kept his\r\neyes fixed upon it for a long time in silence, while the boys chatted\r\ntogether in the light-hearted manner peculiar to those who feel quite\r\ncomfortable, and have no particular aversion even to a moderate amount\r\nof discomfort. Yet Bennie did not seem altogether at ease. There was\r\na slight frown on his noble brow, and he did not show that genial\r\ndisposition which generally distinguished him.\r\n\r\nThe wind was light and fitful. At first it had been favorable, but\r\nbefore long it changed. It did not grow stronger, indeed; yet still,\r\nthough it continued light, the fact that it was acting against them made\r\ntheir prospects worse, and justified Bennie’s fears that they might be\r\nout all night. The distance was not great, being not more than\r\nfifteen miles or so; but their course was in such a direction that the\r\nopposition of wind and tide might delay them to a very uncomfortable\r\nextent. The spur of the coast line, which terminated in Cape Split, as\r\nhas been said, and formed the bay, ran for about five miles, and this\r\ndistance it was necessary to traverse before they could go up the Strait\r\nof Minas.\r\n\r\n“I think, boys,” said Bennie, at last, “we’d best try the oars, for a\r\nwhile at least. We may save a tide. I don’t know, but at any rate we’d\r\nbest try an see; for, you see, we’ve got the wind agin us now,--what\r\nthar is of it,--an thar’s no knowin how much wuss it may grow. If we\r\ncould ony git around, that pint afore the tide turned, we might save\r\nourselves from spendin the night aboard. I did hope that the wind might\r\nfavor us; but it’s changed since we started, an now I see we’d best\r\nprepar for the wust.”\r\n\r\n“All right!” cried Bruce, cheerily: “we’re in for anything. We can pull\r\nas long as you like.”\r\n\r\nUpon this the boys took the oars which were in the boat, and began to\r\nrow. There were four oars. Bennie lowered the sail, and took the stroke\r\noar, Bruce and Arthur took the next oars, and Bart the bow oar. They\r\nrowed in this way for about an hour, and then they changed, Arthur\r\ntaking the stroke oar, Tom and Phil the next oars, and Pat the bow oar.\r\nBruce soon relieved Arthur, and thus they rowed along.\r\n\r\nThe labor at the oars, far from being unpleasant, served to beguile the\r\ntime. Those who were not rowing sang songs to enliven the labor of the\r\nrowers. Bennie was anxious to row all the time, but after the first\r\nhour he was not allowed to row any more, the boys declaring that it was\r\nenough for him to come with them, and that it was no more than fair that\r\nthey should work their own way.\r\n\r\nAs they went, the wind increased somewhat, and, as the tide was strong,\r\nthe two powers combined to oppose their progress. They therefore did\r\nnot make the headway which was desirable, and after one hour of steady\r\npulling they did not find themselves more than half way to Cape Split.\r\nStill, they did not become discouraged, but rowed bravely on, making the\r\nchange above mentioned, and anticipating a turn for the better when once\r\nthey had doubled the cape.\r\n\r\nAt length they reached the cape. More than two hours of hard rowing had\r\nbeen required to bring them there, and on reaching this place they saw\r\nBennie’s face still covered with gloom and anxiety. What that might\r\nmean, they did not at first know; but they soon found out. At first,\r\nhowever, they were too much taken up with their own thoughts, and the\r\nnatural pride which they felt at having attained the aim of so long\r\nand anxious an endeavor, to notice particularly any expression which\r\nBennie’s face might assume. Besides, there was something in the scene\r\nbefore them which was sufficiently grand to engross all their thoughts.\r\n\r\nAmong the freaks of nature, so called, few are more extraordinary,\r\nand at the same time more impressive and sublime, than that which is\r\nafforded by this Cape Split. The whole northern shore of Nova Scotia,\r\nwhich borders on the Bay of Fundy, consists of a high ridge, known\r\nas the North Mountain. With one or two great chasms, like that at the\r\nentrance into Annapolis Basin, it runs along until it arrives at\r\nthe Basin of Minas, where it terminates at the sublime promontory of\r\nBlomidon. Yet it hardly terminates here. Rather it may be said to turn\r\nabout and seek once more to invade the water, which, for so many miles,\r\nit has defied; and thus turning, it advances for some miles into the Bay\r\nof Fundy, forming thus, by this encircling arm, Scott’s Bay, and finally\r\nterminating in Cape Split. Here, where the tides are highest, and the\r\nrush of the waters strongest, Cape Split arises,--wild, rough, worn by\r\nthe sea, and scarred by the storm,--a triple series of gigantic peaks\r\nthat advance into the profoundest depths of the Bav of Fundy, whose\r\nwaters, at every ebb and flow of their tremendous tides, roll, and foam,\r\nand boil, and seethe about the base of the torn promontory. The cliffs\r\nof Blomidon rise precipitously, and Blomidon itself is the centre of\r\nattraction in the scenery of a vast circuit of country; but Blomidon\r\nitself, to a near observer, shows less wildness of outline and less\r\nof picturesque grandeur, than that which is revealed in the terrific\r\noutline of Cape Split. Taken in connection with all the surrounding\r\nlandscape as its centre and heart, Blomidon is undoubtedly superior; but\r\ntaken by itself alone, without any adjuncts save sea and sky, it is Cape\r\nSplit that the artist would choose to portray upon the canvas, or the\r\nlover of the picturesque and the sublime to feast his eyes upon.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the point which they had reached, and they saw before\r\nthem a series of giant rocks towering aloft from the depths of the\r\nsea hundreds of feet into the air,--black, rough, without a trace\r\nof vegetation, thrusting their sharp pinnacles into the sky, while\r\nthousands of sea-gulls screamed about their summits, and myriads of\r\nsea-waves beat about their bases. There the tide rolled, and the\r\nocean currents streamed to and fro, and the billows of the sea kept up\r\nperpetual war, assailing the flinty rock, and slowly wearing away,\r\nas they had been doing through the ages, atom by atom and fragment by\r\nfragment, the forms of these mighty bulwarks of the land.\r\n\r\nThis was the scene upon which they gazed as they reached Cape Split and\r\nprepared to enter into the Strait of Minas. But Bennie’s brow was dark,\r\nand Bennie’s brow was gloomy, and there were thoughts in Bennie’s\r\nmind which had no connection with any grandeur of scenery or beauty\r\nof landscape. For Bennie was thinking of the practical, and not of the\r\npicturesque; and so it was that the question of reaching Parrsboro’ was\r\nof far more importance to him than the glories and the grandeur and all\r\nthe sublime attractions of Cape Split.\r\n\r\n“Tell you what it is, boys,” said he, after a long and thoughtful\r\nsilence, “we’ve missed it, an we’ve got to look sharp, or else we’ll\r\nmiss it agen.”\r\n\r\n“Missed it? Missed what?”\r\n\r\n“What? Why, everything.”\r\n\r\n“Everything. What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, it’s this con-founded tide.”\r\n\r\n“What about it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you see,” said Bennie, scratching his grizzled head, “I thought we\r\nmight git round the cape in time to catch the flood tide, and if so,\r\nit would carry us straight up to Parrsboro’; but, un-fort’nately, we’ve\r\njest missed it. We’ve took so much time in gittin here that we’ve lost\r\nthe flood. The tide’s now on the ebb, an it’s clear agin us. What’s\r\nwuss, it runs down tremenjus, an it’ll be a leetle hard for us to git up\r\nanyhow; an, what’s wusser, thar’s goin to be a fog.”\r\n\r\n“A fog!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a fog, an no mistake. See thar,”--and Bennie pointed down the\r\nbay,--“see thar. The wind’s ben a shiftin an’s finally settled into\r\na son-wester, an thar’s the fog a drawin in all round us, an before\r\nanother half hour we’ll be all shut in, an won’t be able to see the\r\nother end of the boat. What’s wuss still, the fog is goin to be a reglar\r\nsettled fog, an may last a fortnight, an the ony thing that I can see in\r\nour favor jest now is, that the wind is fair for us; but, unfortinately,\r\nthe wind don’t seem to promise to be strong enough to carry us up agin\r\nthe tide.”\r\n\r\n“What! Can’t we get to Parrsboro’ in time for the steamer at all?”\r\n\r\n“The steamer? O, yes, no doubt about that. But what I’m afeard on is,\r\nthat we’ll be all night about it.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, that can’t be helped. We can stand it. We’ve had worse things\r\nthan this to stand of late, and this is mere child’s play.”\r\n\r\n“Child’s play? Wal, I don’t know about that altogether,” said Bennie.\r\n“For my part, I don’t seem to see how goin’ without sleep’s child’s\r\nplay, as you call it; but still I’m glad all the same that you look on\r\nit in this way; I am railly.”\r\n\r\n“O, you needn’t give any thought to us. We’re old stagers. We’ve been\r\nshipwrecked and we’ve lived on desert islands. We’ve risked our lives\r\na dozen times in a dozen days. Fellows that have been cast ashore on\r\nAnticosti and on Sable Island, can’t be frightened at anything that you\r\ncan mention.”\r\n\r\n“After my life on Ile Haute out there,” said Tom, looking at the dim\r\nform of Ile Haute, which was even then being enveloped in the gathering\r\nfog, “I think this is mere child’s play.”\r\n\r\n“And after my adventures in the woods,” said Phil, “I’m ready for\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\n“Pat and I,” said Bart, “have known all the bitterness of death, and\r\nhave felt what it is to be buried alive.”\r\n\r\n“An meself,” said Pat, “by the same token, have known what it is to\r\nbathe in the leper wather, so I have; an what’s fog to that?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Arthur, “I’ve had my turn off Anticosti in the boat, Tom\r\nand I.”\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Bruce, “have had my turn at the Five Islands; so you see\r\nyou’ve got to do with a lot of fellows that don’t care a rush for fogs\r\nand tides, and all that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, young fellers,” said Bennie, “I knock under, I cave in. I won’t\r\nsay anything more. You’re all the right sort, an are ready for anything.\r\nSo come along; an here goes for Parrsboro’. You’ve got to be up all\r\nnight; but arter all, you’ve got wraps and rugs, an bread an butter,\r\nan pie, an can keep yourselves warm, an can have enough to eat,--so\r\nwhat’s the odds, as long as you’re happy? I ain’t a croaker, I ain’t,\r\nbut go in for bein cheerful, an if you ain’t goin to knock under, why I\r\nain’t, an so let’s be jolly an move on.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Bennie hoisted his sail once more. The wind was light, but\r\nfair, and the only question now was, whether that wind would be strong\r\nenough to carry the boat against the tide. As to the tide, that was\r\ncertainly sufficiently strong, but unfortunately it was unfavorable. The\r\ntide had turned, and was running down the Strait of Minas, up which they\r\nwished to go. The tide was thus adverse, and in addition to this was the\r\nfog.\r\n\r\nThe fog!\r\n\r\nYes, the fog, the dreaded, the baleful fog, was coming on. Already Ile\r\nHaute was concealed from view. Soon the opposite shore would be veiled.\r\nWorse than all, the night was coming on. With fog and darkness united,\r\ntheir way would be uncertain indeed.\r\n\r\nFortunately for them, the way was a straight one, and the wind, though\r\nnot very strong, and though opposed by the tide, was yet fair. This much\r\nwas in their favor.\r\n\r\nAnd so they spread their sails. And the wind filled the sails, and the\r\nboat went on. The tide was against them, but still the boat advanced.\r\nSome progress, at last, was made. Hour after hour passed, and still they\r\nwent on. Bennie seemed to be quite encouraged. At last they came to a\r\nwide beach.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” said Bennie, “we’re here at last. This is the place, lads.\r\nWe’re at Parrsboro’! Hurrah!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII.\r\n\r\n_The Village by the Sea.--The Village Inn.--A hospitable\r\nLandlord.--Making Inquiries.--Astounding Intelligence.--Dismay followed\r\nby Despair.--A Search without Result.--A mournful Walk.--A Sail! A\r\nSail!--Boat, Ahoy!--An old Friend!--Great Jubilation.--Conclusion._\r\n\r\n\r\nIT had been a most eventful day for all the boys, and when they stepped\r\nashore it was nine o’clock in the evening. They looked around with some\r\ncuriosity, for they saw no signs of houses just here, though the fog had\r\ndiminished greatly, and it was not so dark but that they could see the\r\noutline of the shore.\r\n\r\n“Now, boys,” said Bennie, “here you are. You see that island in\r\nfront,--well, Parrsboro’ is just behind that, and not more’n half a mile\r\noff by land. It’s too far to go round it in the boat; so we’ll leave her\r\nhere, and I’ll show you the way along the shore.”\r\n\r\nWith these words, Bennie drew up the boat a little distance, and secured\r\nit by putting the anchor out upon the beach. After this he started\r\noff, and the boys followed. Bennie walked along the beach, occasionally\r\nexplaining the different objects around, pointing out Blomidon,\r\nPartridge Island, and other places, all familiar enough, and needing\r\nonly to be mentioned to be recognized by the boys.\r\n\r\nAt length they came in sight of a number of houses on the side of a hill\r\nclose by a cove. Lights shone in the windows, and everything had a most\r\ninviting appearance.\r\n\r\n“Here you air, boys,” said Bennie, “an here I’ll leave you, for you can\r\nfind your way on easy enough. You’ve only got to foller your noses. I’ve\r\ngot to go back an drop down with the tide so as to git to Cape Split\r\nbefore the wind goes down. An so I’ll bid you good by.”\r\n\r\nThe boys made no effort to detain him, for they knew well that the\r\nreturn would be tedious, and had no desire to keep him away from his\r\nhome any longer than they could help. So they all shook hands with him,\r\nthanking him earnestly, and promising, in obedience to his reiterated\r\nrequest, to pay him a visit on their return to school. Bennie now left\r\nthem and returned to his boat, in which he embarked and set sail for\r\nScott’s Bay. The boys went on. The village was reached in a short time,\r\nand they walked to the inn.\r\n\r\nOn entering the parlor of the inn, they were accosted by the landlord,\r\nand the following conversation took place.\r\n\r\n“Can you give us accommodation for the night?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes.”\r\n\r\n“And get us some tea as quick as you can, for we’re starving?”\r\n\r\n“You can have it in half an hour.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right. We’ve just come over from Scott’s Bay, and have had no\r\nend of a tug. We want to take the steamer here to St. John.”\r\n\r\n“O, ye’ll be wantin to wait for the steamer.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it’s the only thing for us to do; and I’m precious glad we’ve got\r\nsuch good quarters.”\r\n\r\n“O, ay. Parrsboro’s a good place to stop at. There be people that stops\r\nhere weeks an months, an says as how it’s one of the best places goin.\r\nI can put yes on the way to the best streams for salmon an trout in the\r\ncountry; an ye can have a nice boat if ye want to go over to Blomidon;\r\nit’s a mighty fine place over there, and folks finds cur’ous minerals;\r\nan if ye want deep-sea fishin, why, out there a mile or two in the bay\r\nye can get no end of cod.”\r\n\r\n“O, for that matter, we haven’t any idea of sporting. We’re in too much\r\nof a hurry. Just get us a tea and bed, and I suppose we’ll have time to\r\nget breakfast to-morrow?”\r\n\r\nThe landlord stared.\r\n\r\n“Time? Breakfast?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; before the steamer comes, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Before the steamer comes?” repeated the landlord, dubiously.\r\n\r\n“Yes; I suppose she won’t touch here too early but that we’ll have time\r\nfor breakfast?”\r\n\r\n“Breakfast? When? To-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why, there’s no steamer comes to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\nAt that astonishing intelligence, all the boys started up to their feet\r\nfrom the easy lounging attitudes into which they had flung themselves,\r\nand surrounding the landlord, stared at him with speechless amazement.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” cried Bruce, at last; “no steamer to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“No; O, dear, no.”\r\n\r\n“Why--why--when does she come here?”\r\n\r\n“Why, she was here this morning, and won’t be here again till this day\r\nweek.”\r\n\r\n“This morning?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; she was here about ten o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“This morning! Ten o’clock!”\r\n\r\n“Jest so.”\r\n\r\nOnce more the boys subsided into silence. All was plain now. Bennie had\r\nutterly mistaken the day of the steamer. It was not an unlikely thing\r\nfor him to do, living as he did in an out-of-the-way place, and having\r\nno interest in the steamer’s movements. But the mistake had been made,\r\nand there was the stolid fact that no steamer would touch at Parrsboro’\r\nfor a whole week to come.\r\n\r\nThe landlord now went off to prepare their tea, and the boys, left to\r\nthemselves, discussed the situation in a low, melancholy, and utterly\r\ndispirited way. At length tea made its appearance--a bounteous repast.\r\nThe well-loaded table gave a new turn to their thoughts, and as they sat\r\ndown with ravenous appetites to partake of the same, they felt that they\r\nhad something still left to live for.\r\n\r\nAfter tea they resumed the discussion of the situation. It seemed to\r\nthem now not by any means so forlorn and gloomy as it had done before\r\ntea, for then they were weary, worn out, and half starved; but now,\r\nthanks to the generous repast, they all felt life, and strength, and\r\nhope, and looked out upon life and its vicissitudes with the utmost\r\nequanimity. So great is the effect which is produced upon the mind by\r\na good dinner! They now invited the landlord to take a share in their\r\ndiscussion, and in order to enable him to do so to the best advantage,\r\nthey enlightened him as to the immediate cause of their presence here,\r\ninforming him about the voyage of the Antelope, her mournful fate, and\r\nBennie Grigg’s kindness in bringing them to Parrs-boro’. Bennie had\r\nindeed been very kind, and had put himself to no end of trouble for\r\ntheir sakes, and was even at that time, perhaps, thinking, with a\r\nglow of satisfaction, of them, little dreaming how completely, though\r\nunintentionally, he had deceived them.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the landlord advised, after hearing all this, was, that\r\nthey had better wait till the steamer came. He offered, if they did\r\nso, to put them in the way of all the sport that the country could\r\nafford,--fishing of all kinds, shooting too, and excursions to places of\r\ninterest. But the landlord’s offer was not very gratefully received. It\r\nwas, in fact, rejected at once most peremptorily.\r\n\r\nWait a week! And in Parrsboro’! Impossible! It was not to be thought of\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\nWhat else was there to do?\r\n\r\nTo this question the landlord showed two answers. One thing to do was\r\nto go by land; another thing, to try to find some schooner, and go by\r\nwater. As to the land route he had much to say. There was a mail stage\r\nthat ran every week to New Brunswick, but as it went only on steamboat\r\ndays, and as it would not go for another week, they found no help here.\r\nThe landlord, however, pointed out to them the fact that they could\r\nhire a wagon and travel in that way. He offered to furnish them with a\r\ncommodious wagon, and a very nice pair of ponies that would take them\r\nthrough to Dorchester, in New Brunswick, where they could catch the\r\nsteamer for St. John, or go in the mail stage. But, unfortunately, on\r\nreckoning up the time and distance, they found that it would take about\r\nfour days to perform their journey in this way.\r\n\r\nThe water route still remained. Could they not find a schooner that was\r\nabout leaving? The landlord rather thought they could. One way would be\r\nto wait till some schooner passed by on its way down the bay, and board\r\nher. He felt certain that any coaster would land them at St. John.\r\nAnother way would be to go to Mill Village,--a part of Parrsboro’, which\r\nlay about a mile off, behind a hill,--and look up a vessel among the\r\nnumerous ones which at that time happened to be in port. Both of these\r\nsuggestions seemed good, and the boys felt sanguine that something might\r\nresult. They therefore dismissed the idea of going by land, and resolved\r\nto wait at least one day, to see whether they might not find some\r\nschooner which would take them down the bay.\r\n\r\nIt was very late when this discussion was finished, and the boys, whom\r\nexcitement had thus far sufficed to keep awake, now yielded to the\r\ncombined influence of fatigue and sleepiness, and retired for the night.\r\nThat night passed in profound slumber, and the dawn of day still found\r\nthem in deep sleep. It was after ten o’clock before any one of them\r\nawoke; and even then, so sleepy were they that they did not feel\r\ninclined to get up. But they had work before them, and so they managed\r\nto dress themselves and put in an appearance at breakfast, which had\r\nbeen waiting for them for two or three hours.\r\n\r\nThen followed a journey to Mill Village. It was a beautiful day; all the\r\nfog was gone; there was not a cloud in the sky; the water was rippled\r\nby a gentle breeze from the north, and its blue surface seemed more\r\ninviting than ever. It seemed to promise them a pleasant return to their\r\nhome if they would only trust themselves once more to it.\r\n\r\nThe landlord had a wagon all ready for them, and a short drive brought\r\nthem to Mill Village. It was rather larger and busier than the little\r\nsettlement where the inn was, and they noticed with delight three\r\nschooners in port. On reaching the place they hurried about, making\r\ninquiries. But the result of the inquiries was not very cheering. The\r\nfirst schooner which they visited was about leaving for Windsor, to take\r\nin a load of plaster, which would occupy a week, after which she would\r\nsail for Boston. Schooner the second would not leave for a fortnight,\r\nfor she was waiting for a cargo of deals. Schooner the third was even\r\nworse. She was not seaworthy, and the skipper was hesitating between\r\nrepairing her and condemning her. On making inquiries further as to the\r\nprobability of other vessels being available along the coast, they could\r\nlearn nothing. And this was the result of their journey, and with this\r\nthey had to satisfy themselves as best they might. There was nothing now\r\nleft but to return to the inn.\r\n\r\nIt was one o’clock when they reached the inn. They were all\r\ndisheartened, and did not know exactly what to do. Dinner over, they\r\nbegan once more to discuss the situation; and the more they discussed it\r\nthe more they found it necessary to hire the landlord’s team and set out\r\nto make the long, roundabout land journey. But it was now too late to\r\nset out on this day, and it would be necessary to wait till the morrow.\r\nThis, then, was the conclusion to which they came; and having reached\r\nit, they began to feel more settled in their minds.\r\n\r\nIt was about three o’clock when this question was at last settled, and\r\nweary with their long discussion, they all went out to stroll about the\r\nvillage and along the beach. The village was not much to speak of. Some\r\nhalf dozen houses, with their attendant barns, comprised it all. The\r\nbeach, however, was very much indeed. To the right, Partridge Island\r\narose, lofty, rugged, wooded, projecting into the Strait of Minas.\r\nOpposite was a long line of precipitous cliff, which terminated in\r\nBlomidon. The beach began at Partridge Island, and ran on in a long,\r\ncurving line for more than two miles, covered with pebbles, and sloping\r\ngradually to the water. The view was remarkably beautiful. On the right,\r\nthe rugged, wooded island; in front, the long line of cliff on the\r\nopposite side of the strait; farther in, the sublime form of Blomidon;\r\non the left, the beach, winding far away till it terminated in a\r\npromontory, beyond which spread the wide waters of the Basin of Minas,\r\nterminated in the dim distance by the far-off line of coast.\r\n\r\nAnd there, as they strolled along the beach, they became aware of an\r\nobject on that wide sheet of water which filled them all with the most\r\nintense interest. A sail!\r\n\r\nYes; there was a sail there, and it was moving towards them--to wards\r\nthe Strait of Minas. Doubtless it was some vessel on its way down the\r\nbay. It was a schooner bound, perhaps, for Boston--or perhaps for St.\r\nJohn. What mattered it? Enough that it was going down the bay.\r\n\r\nOne wild shout of joy burst forth from all that forlorn party as they\r\nrecognized the truth. Here came deliverance; here came a way of escape;\r\nthey were saved. Other times they had known when the sight of an\r\napproaching vessel would have been the assurance of escape from\r\nsomething worse than this, of course; but their situation now, though\r\nnot perilous, was monotonous, and wearisome, and doleful, and altogether\r\nmiserable; and so they naturally hailed this new appearance with shouts\r\nof joy.\r\n\r\nBut how to get to her was now the question.\r\n\r\nHow? Easily enough. Had not the landlord already suggested a way? Had\r\nhe not promised to furnish them with a boat, with which they might board\r\nany passing vessel? Boats there were, in plenty, along the shore, and\r\nany one of these would suffice for their purpose. There was no time to\r\nlose. The schooner was coming quickly on, borne by wind and tide; they\r\nmust make haste.\r\n\r\nAnd they did make haste.\r\n\r\nHurrying back to the inn, they acquainted the landlord with the new\r\nstate of affairs. That worthy, though loath to lose his lodgers, was\r\nstill honest and sympathetic enough to use all energy towards furthering\r\ntheir desires, and proposed at once to take to the boat. As for the\r\nboys, they all felt perfectly sure that this schooner would take them;\r\nand so they insisted on paying their bills and taking a final leave of\r\nthe inn.\r\n\r\nThe boat was launched without any trouble, and soon was passing over the\r\nwaters, impelled by oars in the hands of Bruce, Arthur, Bart, and Tom.\r\nThe schooner came on, nearer and nearer, and finally came within hail.\r\n\r\n“Schooner, ahoy!”\r\n\r\n“Boat, ahoy!”\r\n\r\n“Where are you bound?”\r\n\r\n“Schooner Dart--St. John.”\r\n\r\n“All right. We want to go aboard.”\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the boat was alongside, and the boys were all aboard.\r\nThey waved a farewell to the landlord, who dropped astern, and then\r\nturned to the skipper to make known their wants.\r\n\r\nThe first look which they gave to the skipper, who was standing there\r\nbefore them, was enough to fill them with surprise and delight. In that\r\nbroad, thick-set frame, and that honest, jovial face, they recognized\r\nan old friend and a cherished one--one, too, who was associated with the\r\nmemories of former adventures; in fact, no other than Captain Pratt. At\r\nso strange and unexpected a meeting they were all filled with amazement.\r\nOne cry burst from them all,--\r\n\r\n“Captain Pratt!”\r\n\r\nThe worthy Pratt, on his part, was no less surprised, and, it must be\r\nadded, no less delighted.\r\n\r\n“Why, boys, where in the world have you sprung from? Have you been\r\na cruisin about Minas Basin ever since? It looks like it; but railly\r\nnow--it can’t be--it can’t railly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, not exactly,” said Bart, who then and there began to give a brief\r\noutline of the adventures of the “B. O. W. C.” since the time of their\r\nvisit to Pratt’s Cove, where they had last parted with their worthy\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nNever was there a pleasanter meeting. It was altogether unexpected,\r\nyet not unnatural, for Captain Pratt was a frequent cruiser over these\r\nwaters, and was now, as he informed them, on his way to St. John with a\r\ncargo of deals. The jovial captain made them tell the whole story of\r\nall their adventures since they had last parted with him, in the Bay\r\nof Fundy, in the country about the Bay de Chaleur, in the Gulf of\r\nSt. Lawrence, at Anticosti, Sable Island, and Mahone Bay, and thus\r\nacquainted himself with every particular of the wonderful story which\r\nthey had to tell. The worthy captain regarded it all as a joke, and\r\nat every fresh incident his homeric laughter burst forth in long,\r\nirrepressible peals.\r\n\r\nBut such a story occupied some time in the narration, and before it was\r\nended the schooner was far out of the Strait of Minas, beyond Ile Haute,\r\nin the Bay of Fundy. On one side lay the Nova Scotia shore, on the other\r\nthe coast of New Brunswick. Before them extended the waters of the bay.\r\n\r\nNight came, and they all slept. On the following day, in the afternoon,\r\nthey reached St. John.\r\n\r\nTheir adventures for a time were over. Bart took all his friends to his\r\nown home, where they spent two or three days.\r\n\r\nThen they separated, Phil going to Nova Scotia, and Bruce, Arthur, and\r\nTom to Prince Edward Island. Pat remained with Bart for the rest of the\r\nholidays.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
