If now we consider that thirty-four tons\r\nof Swedes nearly forty tons of Carrots and seventy-four tons of\r\nMangold roots have been raised in Massachusetts, to the acre, and\r\nthat to each of these crops should be added at least 15 per cent. for\r\nthe fodder value of the yield of leaves, which were not included in\r\nthese estimates, we have a demonstration of how immensely more is the\r\nnourishment that can be obtained from an acre of roots than from an\r\nacre in hay. Such an immense increase in the nourishing products of\r\nthe farm, if fed on the premises as it should be, unless the farmer\r\nis so located that he can buy manure cheaper than he can make it,\r\nmeans a great increase in the manure products, and consequently a\r\ngreat increase in the crops,--so that it has been wisely said, root\r\nculture lies at the basis of good husbandry.\r\n\r\nCarrots and Mangolds are subject to but few diseases. In discussing\r\nthe nutritious value, chemists differ somewhat, according as they\r\nmeasure this by the nitrogen they contain, their per cent. of dry\r\nmatter or sugar, but they agree in ranking them much superior to the\r\nearly varieties of turnip and somewhat superior to the Ruta Baga\r\nor Swede class, particularly when fed to full grown cattle. Prof.\r\nJohnson ranks Carrots with Cabbage when fed to oxen, for nourishment.\r\nExperiments appear to have proved that when equal measures of each\r\nare fed, Mangolds will give a greater increase of milk than potatoes,\r\nby about a third. For some reason not fully understood (perhaps the\r\ndepth they penetrate the soil has something to do with it) Onions\r\nwill do better after Carrots than after any other crop, the yield\r\nbeing larger, the bulb handsomer, while the crop will bottom down\r\nearlier and better. Unlike Turnips or Swedes, with high manuring the\r\ncrop can be profitably grown for years on the same piece of land.\r\nSwine prefer Mangolds to any root except the parsnip, and both in\r\nthis country and in England store hogs, weighing from 125 lbs. and\r\nupwards have been carried through the winter in fine condition, when\r\nfed wholly on raw Sugar Beets or Mangolds. Chemists rank Carrots,\r\nwhen compared with oats, with reference to their fat and flesh\r\nforming qualities, as 1 to 5.\r\n\r\nNot only have roots a value in themselves as food, but they have\r\na special office, taking to a large degree the place of grass and\r\npreventing the constipation that dry feed sometimes causes. While\r\npractice proves that they should not be relied upon to entirely\r\nsupersede hay or grain, still they increase the value of either of\r\nthese to a large degree; and for slow working stock they may be fed\r\nwith profit in place of from a third to half the grain usually given.\r\nCarrots add not only to the richness of the color, but also to the\r\nquality of the milk, while the flavor of the butter made from such\r\nmilk is improved. Carrots fed in moderate quantities to horses give\r\nadditional gloss to their hairy coats, and have not only a medicinal\r\nvalue when given to such as have been over-grained, but aid them in\r\ndigesting grain, as may be seen in the dung of horses fed on oats\r\nwith Carrots, and that of those fed on oats without Carrots. When\r\ncooked they are sometimes fed to poultry, and either cooked or raw\r\nto swine. In the family economy they have their place, particularly\r\nwhen young and fresh, while in Europe they enter largely into the\r\ncomposition of the well-known vegetable soups of the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE CARROT.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Carrot,” (_Daucus Carota_) says Burr in his “Field and Garden\r\nVegetables of America,” a book worthy a place in every farmer’s\r\nlibrary,--“in its cultivated state is a half-hardy biennial. It is\r\nindigenous to some parts of Great Britain, generally growing in\r\nchalky or sandy soil, and to some extent has become naturalized in\r\nthis country; being found in gravelly pastures and mowing fields, and\r\noccasionally by roadsides, in loose places, where the surface has\r\nbeen disturbed or removed. In its native state the root is small,\r\nslender and fibrous or woody, of no value, and even of questionable\r\nproperties as an article of food.”\r\n\r\nThe average result of several analyses of the Carrot as given by Dr.\r\nVoelcker, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Water,                   87.0\r\n    Albuminous Compounds,      .7\r\n    Fat,                       .2\r\n    Pectine,                  1.2\r\n    Cellular Fiber,           3.5\r\n    Sugar,                    6.5\r\n    Ash,                       .9\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE LOCATION AND SOIL.\r\n\r\nIt is important in selecting a location for the Carrot bed that the\r\nland should be nearly level, as otherwise the seed will be liable to\r\nwash out after heavy showers, and the plants while young be either\r\nwashed out or covered with soil and killed. The land should be, as\r\nfar as possible, clear of all stones. The presence of large rocks “in\r\nplace,” as the geologists say, would interfere with the continuity of\r\nthe rows, while the loose stones are not only always in the way while\r\nraking and planting the bed, but are also in the way of the slide or\r\nwheel hoes which are apt to knock them against the young plants to\r\ntheir injury. The strongest objections to a stony soil, for Carrots,\r\nare that it interferes with the growth of the roots and greatly\r\nincreases the labor of digging them. It is important that the piece\r\nof ground selected for a crop that will require so much manure and\r\nlabor should have every advantage possible in its favor; it should\r\nnot only be level and comparatively free from stones, but if possible\r\nshould have been previously under high cultivation, that it may come\r\nto Carrots when in high condition.\r\n\r\nThe best soil, particularly for the Long Orange variety, is a loam\r\nmellow to the depth of two feet or more. On such soil the Carrot\r\nwill perfect itself, growing straight and altogether beautiful to\r\nlook upon, as they stretch from side to side of the bushel boxes. On\r\nsome market gardens near critical markets, farmers find it for their\r\ninterest to ascertain by actual experiment on what part of their\r\ngrounds the root will grow longest and straightest, and when such\r\nplot is found make it a permanent bed. If the soil does not naturally\r\ngrow a long Carrot and they are desired, the end may be attained by\r\ntrenching deep and adding sand. The difference in the shape of the\r\nLong Orange, when grown on a deep mellow loam, and on a heavy soil\r\nwith a compact sub-soil, is so remarkable that it would be almost\r\nimpossible to make an inexperienced person believe each lot was from\r\nthe same seed,--those grown on the heavy soil, resting on a compact\r\nsub-soil, oftentimes so closely resembling the Intermediate varieties\r\nas not to be distinguished from them. Though the course is not on the\r\nwhole to be advised, yet Carrots can be raised on freshly turned sod.\r\nSuch land will be very free from weeds, and by making good use of the\r\nwheel harrow, and applying manure in a very fine state, should the\r\nseason be a moist one, fair crops may be raised. Reclaimed meadows\r\nin a good state of cultivation, which are well-drained to the depth\r\nof thirty inches, will oftentimes grow crops, large in bulk, but the\r\nindividual roots are oftentimes inclined to “sprangle,” and unless\r\nsuch meadows have been well drained, and liberally covered with sand\r\nor gravelly loam, they are apt to be spongy and inferior. When grown\r\non land inclining to clay, they are apt to be small and woody in\r\nstructure; still, such land, if made friable by good underdraining\r\nand the application of sand, may be made fair Carrot ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE MANURE AND ITS APPLICATION.\r\n\r\nAll root crops delight in most liberal manuring and the highest of\r\ncultivation. Carrots are no exception to this rule. With every crop,\r\nother conditions being equal, _it is the last half of the manure\r\ngives the profits_; and the more costly the cultivation required the\r\nmore important it is that this golden fact be borne in mind. Though\r\nchemical analysis shows difference in the composition of all roots,\r\nand that there is therefore an office for special manures, yet their\r\ngeneral composition is so nearly alike, and animal manures, most\r\nof which contain in greater or less proportion, all the elements\r\nrequired, are so difficult to handle in just the proportions that\r\nwould be required from the chemical standpoint, particularly when we\r\nconsider that soils on which root crops are grown are usually rich\r\nin manures, varying in their chemical constituents, left over from\r\nformer crops;--for this reason I treat of manure by the cord and with\r\nreference to its comparative strength, bulk for bulk, rather than of\r\nits chemical elements.\r\n\r\nEight cords of good stable manure; nine cords of a compost made of\r\none part night soil to two parts muck or loam; eight cords of muscle\r\nmud; six or eight cords of rotten kelp--either of these applied to\r\nan acre of land in good condition by previous high cultivation would\r\nbe sufficient for a good crop of Carrots. Other manures might be\r\nmentioned, but these will serve as a pretty good measure of value\r\nfor any kind accessible to farmers in general. To produce a very\r\nlarge crop, such as one would like to be able to point to when\r\npremium crops are called for, add from one-quarter to one-half to\r\nthe above quantities. The condition of the manure is a matter of\r\nimportance; the stable manure should be good; not half bedding, not\r\nburnt, neither too coarse nor too new; the night soil should have\r\nbeen well mixed with the soil in the compost heap, and have been\r\npitched over twice with sufficient intervals between to allow it to\r\ndevelop some heat. The muscle mud should be rich in dead muscles. In\r\nall farming, it is important that the manures applied should be in a\r\nfine condition mechanically, and particularly is this true of root\r\ncrops. For the roots of all plants can take up only such parts of the\r\nmanures as are dissolved in water, and the firmer the manure is the\r\nmore readily can water penetrate it.\r\n\r\n_A man who is unfortunately short of manures can materially increase\r\nthe capacity of what he has by working it over until it is very fine._\r\n\r\nWhen short of a supply of animal manure, where the soil is already\r\nin good condition, a good fertilizer can be used with success. Apply\r\nfifteen hundred pounds to the acre. The famous fertilizer formulas of\r\nProf. Stockbridge have generally done so well I should be willing to\r\ntry them on an acre of Carrots, were I short of other manures.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter concerning our manures which requires\r\nattention; if they are too fresh or crude they will be apt, if\r\napplied to our long growing varieties, to drive the growth too\r\nmuch into the top of the Carrot, to the loss of the root, giving\r\nus tops to our knees with roots about the size of a hoe handle. It\r\nis important therefore, when used liberally, that they should be\r\nsomewhat decomposed--that the mixtures should be _composts_, as\r\nfar as the time will allow, and not mere mixtures. To the shorter\r\nvarieties the crude manure may be applied with a degree of safety.\r\nHere let me note a fact that I think is of general application in\r\nfarming, viz.:--that a style of manuring that will drive tall growing\r\nvarieties of vegetables nearly all to tops or vine, with dwarf\r\nvarieties of the same kind will work admirably. The Pea is a very\r\ngood illustration; to get a good crop of a dwarf variety, manure\r\nliberally, but the same quantity applied to the taller sorts would\r\ndrive them excessively into vine at the expense of the crop.\r\n\r\nDon’t make your compost heap on the ground where the crop is to\r\ngrow, for the result will be no crop where the heap stands. For the\r\nsame reason it is bad policy to cart out any strong manure to stand\r\non the land in heaps, no matter how small, over winter. There will\r\nbe nothing lost by spreading the manure over the surface before the\r\nground is frozen. In getting it into the soil, _keep it as near the\r\nsurface as possible_ without its interfering with the planting of the\r\nseed, bearing in mind the nitrogen, that element in manures, about\r\nthe loss of which by evaporation there is much uncalled for anxiety,\r\ntends to work down into the soil. If the manure is coarse it may be\r\napplied to the surface in the Fall and be deeply ploughed in, and in\r\nthe Spring again brought to the surface by ploughing equally deep,\r\nhaving meanwhile received the benefits of frost and moisture.\r\n\r\nIn applying fertilizers keep them near the surface, scattering them\r\nbroadcast and raking or harrowing in. It is better not to apply\r\nthese all at once. Apply about two-thirds at the time of sowing, the\r\nremainder when the crop is about one-third grown--following it with\r\nthe slide hoe, which will tend to work it in just under the surface.\r\nIn applying all fertilizers in the Spring time, it is well to do\r\nso early in the day, as winds are apt to rise as the day advances,\r\nwhich seriously interfere with the economical application and even\r\ndistribution. Fertilizers tend to hasten the maturity of the crops\r\nto which they are applied. There is one condition that has a very\r\nimportant bearing on the cost of Carrots and all roots, viz.:--that\r\nboth the ground and manure should be as free from all weed seed as\r\npossible. For this reason ground recently from the sod, the third\r\nyear, provided it has been kept under a high state of cultivation,\r\nand such manures which from their very nature must be comparatively\r\nfree from the seed of weeds, such as fish composts, night soil, or\r\nbarn manure a year old, are to be preferred.\r\n\r\nDr. Voelcker gives the result of 10 analyses of the ashes of the\r\nroot and 2 of the ashes of the leaves of the Carrot, and from these\r\ndeduces the following as the number of pounds of mineral matter taken\r\nfrom an acre of land, by 10 tons of roots and 4 tons of tops.\r\n\r\n         Potash,      Soda,      Lime,      Phosphoric Acid,\r\n         116 lbs.    86 lbs.    101 lbs.        31 lbs.\r\n\r\n                   Sulphuric Acid,      Chlorine,\r\n                      34 lbs.            31 lbs.\r\n\r\nTo those who desire to experiment with mineral manures this table\r\nwill be interesting as showing the kinds and proportion of each\r\nneeded. The potash is found in unleached ashes, from two to five\r\npounds to the bushel; or in the German Potash salts; the soda and\r\nchlorine in common salt, (chloride of sodium); lime in the common\r\nlime of the mason, the Phosphoric acid in the phosphates offered in\r\nthe markets, and the Sulphuric acid in that directly or in common\r\nfinely ground plaster known by chemists as Sulphate of Lime.\r\n\r\nI shall have occasion to present some very valuable suggestions of\r\nthe learned Professor, under the head of “The Manure” in my article\r\non Mangolds, to which they more especially apply.\r\n\r\nThe greatest single item in the cost of any crop is the manure, but\r\nthis is an exceedingly varying element. Farmers near cities, and\r\nparticularly if they also reside near the sea-coast, as an off-set\r\nfor the greater cost of farming-land and expenses of living, have\r\nthe advantages of a city market and special facilities for collecting\r\nmanures, at a cost to them, much below the standard value of stable\r\nmanure. Night soil to almost an unlimited extent can be obtained for\r\nthe cost of collecting it, while the waste material of the fisheries,\r\nKelp, Rock Weed, Muscle Mud, Glue Waste, Sugar House Waste, and\r\nthe products of the distilleries, these and other rich fertilizers\r\ncan be procured at so low a figure, in proportion to their value,\r\nthat root crops can be raised considerably cheaper than in farming\r\ndistricts not so favored. Many a man can be found in these favored\r\ndistricts who thinks he is making a good business at farming, yet\r\ncould he but sell the manure he gathers so cheaply, at its market\r\nvalue, barn manure being the standard, he would make money by doing\r\nso and folding his arms the rest of the year. The fact is he is\r\nreally losing money at farming; but through his crops he is selling\r\nwhat cost him but a trifle--at a price, indeed, below its real value,\r\nbut still so far in advance of cost as to leave a profit. Such a man\r\ndoes wisely in the course he pursues though he makes a mistake in the\r\ndebtor and creditor side of the account, for it is most decidedly\r\nwiser to be at work than idle, though the result makes no difference\r\nin the dollars in a man’s pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PREPARING THE BED.\r\n\r\nThe great object here should be to get the soil thoroughly fine that\r\nthe small, thread-like fibers, and the roots themselves, may waste\r\nthe least possible vital power in permeating the earth in search of\r\nfood, or in pushing downwards. The vitality wasted in this way is\r\njust so much taken from growth, and may make the sole difference\r\nbetween a good crop and a poor one. If it is necessary that the\r\nfirst ploughing should be a very deep one, better apply the manure\r\n(as previously stated, the finer mechanical condition this is in the\r\nbetter) afterwards. Should the manure be to any degree coarse after\r\nspreading, run the brush or wheel harrow over it, one or both. This\r\nwill also break up the clods and fine up the soil and incorporate the\r\nmanure with it. If still at all lumpy, follow with a plank drag. Next\r\nplow shallow a few furrows, and have men, with wooden-toothed hand\r\nrakes, rake at right angles, pulling all coarse stones and lumps of\r\nearth and manure into the last furrow made. In brief, proceed to make\r\nas fine a seed bed as for onions.\r\n\r\nIf any one, depending on the apparent fineness of the surface,\r\nconcludes to dispense with the final raking and let the work of the\r\nbrush harrow answer, he will be apt to repent it before the season\r\ncloses; should he try it let him be sure to double the quantity of\r\nseed planted in that portion of the land so treated. When the land is\r\nloamy and free from stones an implement known as the “Meeker Harrow,”\r\nwill be found to be a great time-saver in preparing the seed bed; by\r\nactual test on my own farm, I find that it will do the work of more\r\nthan a dozen hands with rakes. If the bed has its first ploughing\r\nearly in the season, much of the weed seed will germinate before\r\nplanting time, then an occasional use of the cultivator will destroy\r\nmany of the pests.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WHEN TO PLANT.\r\n\r\nSome of our best farmers advocate planting about the middle of May,\r\nothers equally successful in root culture claim that the middle of\r\nJune is the best time. There are arguments for both early and late\r\nplanting. In New England we usually have the weather sufficiently\r\nmoist towards the close of May to insure the germination of the seed\r\nand protect the plants when they break ground, from “sun-scald.”\r\nThose planted as late as the middle of June are more liable to be so\r\naffected by the dry weather usual at that period as not to vegetate\r\nas well; and should the heat be very great just after they push\r\nthrough the ground, sometimes in a single day nearly the entire crop\r\nwill disappear by “sun-scald.” But on the other hand, by planting\r\nlate we about get rid of one weeding, assuming that the ground is\r\nstirred by the cultivator occasionally, up to the time of planting.\r\nAgain, this brings the crop in full vigor in October, the month of\r\nall others most favorable for the growth of the root, and the Carrots\r\nbeing dug while the tops are in fair growing condition, keep better\r\nthan when dug fully ripe. The argument for late planting holds\r\nespecially good for the Short Horn varieties, as these require a\r\nshorter time to mature than the long kinds. If the crop is planted\r\ntoo early, sometimes the roots, having matured, will attempt to\r\npush seed shoots; when this is so they will be found woody in their\r\nstructure, with numberless thread-like roots, while their quality and\r\nkeeping properties are greatly injured. This crop on rich land is\r\nsometimes planted as late as the first week in July, and with great\r\nsuccess, should the Fall prove exceptionably mild, yet, as a rule, I\r\nwould not recommend planting later than the middle of June. If it so\r\nhappens, from press of work, or the dry weather, the farmer has to\r\nplant later than this, then by all means let him confine himself to\r\nthe earlier varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE SEED AND THE PLANTING OF IT.\r\n\r\nThe seed grows with a covering of small, short, stiff hairs, which\r\nmakes them adhere together; these must be very thoroughly removed\r\nbefore the seed can be relied upon to flow freely from the machine.\r\nMuch of foreign grown seed reaches this country not properly cleaned.\r\nTo remove this furze, either thrash the seed with the flail very\r\nthoroughly, when the weather is quite cold and dry, or warm the seed\r\nslightly and rub it with the hand against the wires of a sieve, of\r\na right degree of fineness to let the hairs fall through. Either\r\nwinnow or sink in water, to remove all impurities. If sunk, be\r\ncareful to dry the seed at a very moderate temperature. As Carrot\r\nseed vegetates somewhat slowly and the plants are quite small when\r\nthey first appear, weeds are apt to get the start of them before\r\nthe rows can be seen with sufficient distinctness to make it safe\r\nto use the slide hoe. For this reason some farmers practice soaking\r\nthe seed in water and keeping it at a temperature that will nearly\r\ndevelop the sprout, before planting. This may be done by soaking the\r\nseed from 36 to 48 hours in milk warm, or rather strong manure water,\r\nthen removing it to where the air is of about the same temperature.\r\nStir, it slightly for a few days, and finally dry it sufficiently to\r\ndrop freely from the machine by adding plaster, charcoal or dust.\r\nCamphor has a wonderful effect in stimulating the vitality of seed,\r\nand the addition of a small quantity of it to the manure water would\r\ndoubtless be of advantage. This process should not be carried so far\r\nas to develop the sprout. Should the surface of the ground be very\r\ndry when the seed is sown, this soaking process may be fatal, for\r\nif the germ is once started it will not live in a dormant state;\r\nit must either grow or die: whereas, seed that have not been soaked\r\nwill vegetate after rains wet the dry surface. Be sure that the seed\r\nplanter has a good roller attached to it, and not a mere coverer,\r\nas this will help confine the moisture and thus materially aid in\r\ndeveloping the seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    QUANTITY OF SEED TO THE ACRE.\r\n\r\nTables vary greatly some advising as high as four pounds to the acre.\r\nIf the design is to raise small-sized roots for early marketing,\r\npossibly this might not be an excess of seed, but to advise so heavy\r\nseeding for ordinary field crops, means that much of the seed is poor\r\ntrash, probably old and worthless, and put in as a make-weight.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a party wrote me, offering a variety of garden seed at\r\na very low figure, and stated that it was of his own raising. As it\r\nwas a kind that I was in the habit of raising, I had the curiosity\r\nto write and ask how he could afford to raise it at such a price.\r\nHe replied that it was of his own growing, but so old as to be good\r\nfor nothing, and therefore he sold it to seedsmen at a very low\r\nfigure, to mix with their good seed to _help make weight_! When four\r\npounds of Carrot seed are advised to the acre, for a field crop,\r\nI think that some of this kind of seed must somehow have got into\r\nthe mixture. With everything favoring, and the farmer by experience\r\nhaving his seed sower under perfect control, rather less than a pound\r\nof seed will be sufficient for an acre. The great object to aim at\r\nis, while having the plants thick enough, not to have much of any\r\nthinning to do, as it costs about as much to thin a crop as it does\r\nto weed it, with the drawback that the plants left in the ground are\r\nmore or less started, and so put back by the thinning. As a general\r\nrule I would advise one and one-half pounds of seed to the acre,\r\nand this the farmer can reduce in proportion as he is favored by\r\ncircumstances and advances in experience.\r\n\r\nTwelve inches is a sufficient distance between the rows of the two\r\nsmall, early varieties, and fifteen between the rows of all other\r\nsorts. With the greatest of care the seed will not come up with\r\nmathematical precision. Some advocate leaving a plant to about every\r\ninch of row; others, to thin to four inches apart. With the exception\r\nof the shorter variety including the Guerande, which are somewhat\r\nlike Onions in their aptitude to grow to a good size when crowded,\r\npushing out either side of the rows, as a rule I advise thinning to\r\nfour inches, leaving them thicker near the vacant places.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  VARIETIES, AND WHAT KINDS TO GROW.\r\n\r\nForeign catalogues give lists of about two dozen varieties, which\r\ndiffer in earliness, size, color, form, termination of root,\r\ncharacteristic of growing entirely under or partly above ground, and\r\nin the size of the core or heart. In foreign catalogues, what we call\r\n“Orange,” are known as “Red” Carrots. From a test of these varieties\r\nI have thus far found two, viz.: the Guerande and the Chantenay\r\nworthy of being added to the kinds already grown to a greater or less\r\nextent in the United States. The yellow-fleshed sorts are repudiated\r\nin New England by general consent; yet the Yellow Belgian, on a\r\nlimited trial has proved with me to be an exceptionally good keeper.\r\nThe Purple or Blood-Red is of a deep purple color, a poor cropper\r\nand by no means attractive to the eye. The remaining varieties may be\r\nclassed as follows:--Early, middling early and late. The first class\r\nis made up of the Early Very Short Scarlet, the Early Scarlet Horn\r\nand Guerande. The second class of all the half-long or short-horn\r\nvarieties, and the third, of the long varieties, such as Long Orange,\r\nBelgian and Altringham sorts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to about one-half of these foreign varieties, cultivated\r\nmore or less generally in this country, there are several kinds\r\ncatalogued by seedsmen, all of which are but improved strains made\r\nby careful selections, through a series of years, from what was\r\noriginally imported stock. These strains usually bear the name of\r\nsome person. A brief discussion of the more valuable varieties\r\nwill now be in order. Here I will lay down three general facts,\r\nviz.:--1st, that of the various orange colored varieties, the\r\nshorter growing kinds are, as a rule, the darker colored and sweeter\r\nflavored. 2d, that the proportion of dark, orange-colored roots in\r\nany crop, while it will depend largely on the care that has been used\r\nin the selection of seed stock for a series of years, does not turn\r\nwholly on this, but soil, season or manure, one or all, have some\r\ninfluence in this direction. 3d, that the fact that more or less of\r\nthe Carrots tend to push seed shoots the first year, while with the\r\nlong varieties it may prove that the seed has been allowed to mix\r\nwith the wild varieties, yet the probability (marked cases excepted)\r\nis decidedly the other way; while with the short horn varieties\r\nthis tendency to push seed shoots the first season, so as to make\r\nsomething of a show when an acre is glanced over, is quite a common\r\ncharacteristic with seed of the very purest strain.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n    EARLY VERY      EARLY SHORT      SHORT HORN.      LONG ORANGE.\r\n  SHORT SCARLET.      SCARLET.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Early Very Short Scarlet.= (see engraving.)\r\n\r\n=Early Short Scarlet Horn.= (see engraving). These two varieties are\r\nthe shortest grown and are raised at times in forcing beds, for an\r\nearly market, the former very generally so. They are of a very rich\r\norange color, fine-grained, sweet, and of excellent flavor, heading\r\nthe list for quality. Their rich color makes them valuable above all\r\nother kinds for coloring butter. Though quite short, yet the Early\r\nShort Scarlet Horn can be grown to yield a great bulk of roots, from\r\nthe fact that from the smallness of their tops the roots can be\r\ngrown very thick, two or three abreast all along the rows. When the\r\nsmall, handy size of this variety is considered in connection with\r\nthe superior quality, it stands foremost as a table Carrot, and I\r\ntherefore recommend it in preference to all others for family use.\r\n\r\n=Short Horn.= (See engraving.) This variety intermediate between the\r\nEarly Forcing and Long Orange, with but slight variations in form, is\r\nshown under various names, as Intermediate, Nantes, Half Long, James’\r\nImproved, Stump-Rooted, etc. It is characterized by a darker color\r\nthan the average of the Long Orange, finer grain, and a sweeter and\r\nricher flavor. In part from the more solid structure of the Carrot,\r\nand in part from its better stowage, thirty-six measured bushels of\r\nthis variety make a ton, while of the larger varieties forty bushels\r\nare required. The best strain of this variety is doubtless the kind\r\nknown as the “Danvers” Carrot.\r\n\r\n=Danvers Carrot.= In the town of Danvers, Mass., the raising\r\nof Carrots on an extensive scale has for years been quite a\r\nbusiness--the farmers finding a large market in the neighboring\r\ncities of Salem, Lynn and Boston. After years of experimenting they\r\nsettled upon a variety which originated among them (as did the\r\nDanvers Onion) known in their locality as the “Danvers Carrot.” It is\r\nin form about midway between the Long Orange and Short Horn class,\r\ngrowing very generally with a stump root. The great problem in Carrot\r\ngrowing is to get the greatest bulk with the smallest length of root,\r\nand this is what the Danvers’ growers have attained in their Carrot.\r\nUnder their cultivation they raise from twenty to forty tons to the\r\nacre. This Carrot is of a rich, dark orange in color, very smooth and\r\nhandsome, and from its length, is easier to dig than the Long Orange.\r\nIt is a first-class Carrot for any soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUERANDE CARROT.]\r\n\r\n=Guerande or Ox Heart.= This variety is a great favorite with many\r\nwho raise Carrots for stock. It is short and chunky in build, of a\r\nrich orange color, and of excellent quality, and the crop can be hand\r\npulled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED LONG ORANGE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANVERS CARROT.]\r\n\r\n=Long Orange, or Long Surry.= This is a standard variety, and in its\r\nvarious strains is doubtless more generally grown than any other\r\nkind. The chief objection to it is the depth to which it penetrates\r\nthe ground, and hence the extra work of digging it; while the end\r\nof the root which causes the extra work is of inferior quality when\r\ncompared with the body, differing in this respect from the shorter\r\nvarieties, which are of the same quality throughout. The heart\r\nis larger in proportion than in the shorter varieties, which is\r\nconsidered an objection. The keeping properties are excellent, and in\r\nthis respect it is superior to the earlier kinds. On light soil the\r\nroots grow long, straight and make a fine show in the market.\r\n\r\n=Altringham.= This is a Carrot of excellent quality for the table,\r\nthe flesh being of a rich orange color, crisp and sweet, but as a\r\ncropper it is inferior to the Intermediate or Long Orange varieties,\r\nand hence is but little cultivated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARGE WHITE BELGIAN.]\r\n\r\n=Large White Belgian.= This is the largest of all varieties and\r\nwill yield at least a quarter more than any other sort. The roots\r\ngrow several inches out of ground, and all can be readily pulled by\r\nthe hand. Analysis shows that it is nearly as sweet as the Mangold\r\nWurtzel, rather sweeter than the Swede Turnip, and about two thirds\r\nas sweet as the Sugar Beet. The two objections to it are its color\r\nand its keeping properties; it being rather a poor keeper, while the\r\ncolor has made it a carrot for horses rather than cows. If farmers\r\nhave but a small quantity of manure, the White Belgian is a good\r\nvariety for them to raise for feeding early in the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE CULTIVATION, AND THE IMPLEMENTS\r\n                               NEEDED.\r\n\r\nJust as soon as the young plants can be detected breaking round, the\r\nprudent farmer will push the slide hoe, and have his boy weeders\r\nfollow immediately after it on hands and knees. Boys that have had a\r\nlittle experience, with their nimble fingers can do more work than\r\nmen, while their wages are only about half as much. On the sea-coast\r\nwe hire boys who make a business of weeding, for from seventy-five\r\ncents to a dollar a day. The one great danger in hiring boys is that\r\ncareless ones are apt to break off the weeds instead of pulling them\r\nup by the roots. To ascertain their comparative faithfulness, it is\r\nwell to quietly mark a few rows of the different weeders, at their\r\nfirst weeding, and by the time for the second weeding the difference\r\nbetween a good and a bad one will be very plainly visible.\r\n\r\nDon’t accept that theory of the shiftless man, that it is well to\r\nhave the weeds grow pretty tall before the first weeding, that the\r\nplants may be protected from the sun. I have noticed that oftentimes\r\nthose who act on this theory give over their weeding, and plough up\r\nthe bed before they have half finished it. Promptness in the first\r\nhoeing and weeding is exceedingly important in the management of all\r\nroot crops, and it is where the greatest mistake is apt to be made in\r\ntheir cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLIDE HOE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEEL HOE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: McGEE CULTIVATOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MICHIGAN SEED SOWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANG’S HAND WEEDER.]\r\n\r\nThere are a few implements that are specially needed in the\r\ncultivation of root crops, and of these, every wise farmer will get\r\nthe very best attainable. These implements are the Seed Sower, the\r\nHand Weeder, the Slide Hoe, the common Wheel Hoe, and one for weeding\r\nboth sides of a row at the same time. Of these there are a great\r\nmany varieties, each of which are more or less popular among a class\r\nof growers. The engravings illustrate such as are in use in my own\r\nsection of country, where root culture forms a very important part\r\nof the agriculture of farmers. Both the slide and the wheel hoe, for\r\nrapid work, far surpass the common hand hoe, while they cut up the\r\nweeds equally clear. The double wheel hoe is used until the tops\r\nof the crops become so large as to be in the way, when the single\r\nwheel hoe or slide hoe takes its place. Fuller’s Unique Hoe having a\r\nsingle wheel is preferred, to any double wheeled implement by many\r\ngardeners, especially so by reason of its stiffness. Each should be\r\ntwo inches narrower than the space between the rows. A slide hoe is\r\nan amazing handy implement about a farm for many uses other than\r\nbetween the rows of root crops. A new class of implements have been\r\nintroduced within a few years which, to a degree, supersede the use\r\nof the common wheel or slide hoe, though there is yet a valuable\r\nsphere for each of them; I refer to the weeders which cut each side\r\nof the row at the same time. I have tested every variety of these and\r\nhave found nothing now in the market superior to the McGee Garden\r\nCultivator. These hoes which take each side of the row at once cannot\r\nsafely be made to go over the ground as fast as those designed for\r\nuse between the rows, but working close home to the growing crop,\r\nthey save a large portion of the cost of hard weeding. Of seed drills\r\nthere are a dozen or more in the market, several of which I have\r\nused on my farms. I prefer the Michigan over all others. Among other\r\nadvantages it can be relied upon to drop almost any variety of small\r\nseed, while it is a good coverer and having a roller attached, it\r\npacks the earth over the seed, which, as every farmer knows, tends\r\nto keep the moisture in and thus hastens their germination. The hand\r\nweeder is an excellent little implement to facilitate the laborious\r\nwork of weeding, especially when the surface is baked and therefore\r\nrather hard on the fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   GATHERING AND STORING THE CROP.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest outlays attending the raising of Carrots is\r\nin the gathering and topping of the crop. The common process of\r\ndigging with a fork and throwing into piles to be afterwards topped\r\nis laborious and costly. Where the crop is to be consumed on the\r\nfarm, the labor and consequent cost may be greatly lessened by first\r\ncutting off the tops by a sharp shovel, spade or common hoe, or a\r\nslide hoe which has been weighed by a piece of lead pipe, or some\r\nsimilar heavy article, slid down the handle and fastened where that\r\nunites with the hoe. Should a slice be taken off the tops of the\r\nroots it will do no harm, as Carrots differ in this respect from\r\nother roots, in that, when the tops are cut they are not apt to rot;\r\nindeed, some practice cutting off a slice of the top when topping,\r\nto keep them from sprouting so readily when stored. The common way\r\nof gathering the crop, by loosening with spades or forks and then\r\npulling out by the tops, throwing into heaps or scattering over the\r\nground and afterwards topping with a knife, is a long and costly job.\r\nAn improvement on digging is to run a plough close to the row and\r\nthen pull out as many as possible by hand and dig up the remainder.\r\nStill a better course particularly when the Danvers variety is grown,\r\nis beginning in the middle of the piece, to run a subsoil plough\r\nclose home to the roots, when, if run sufficiently deep it will lift\r\nthe Carrots a little out of the ground. Follow with forks or hoes and\r\ndraw the roots inward on the ploughed portion, so far as to give room\r\nfor the horse to walk. Let the roots remain a few hours scattered\r\nover the surface, when in picking up and tossing them into carts or\r\nbaskets, any earth adhering will be jarred off.\r\n\r\nLet the crop remain out as late as it can be risked without freezing;\r\nand if they are in good growing condition this will be well towards\r\nNovember, in the latitude of central New England, and even into the\r\nfirst week of that month in the milder temperature of the sea-coast.\r\nRoots not fully matured will keep better than those fully ripe when\r\ndug, on the principle that the varieties of apples we call “winter”\r\napples are simply those kinds that do not ripen on the tree--they are\r\nnot winter apples, because they are Baldwins, or Greenings, for these\r\nsame kinds in the South where the ripening season is longer, are Fall\r\napples. If the Carrots have been planted too early they will ripen\r\nbefore digging, and be apt to send out roots and prove poor keepers,\r\nbesides losing the advantage of October weather which is the Carrot\r\nmonth, doing more for the weight of the late planted crop than all\r\nthe season besides.\r\n\r\nRake the tops off the bed but do not waste them, for they are highly\r\nrelished by animals, and if the Carrots are harvested when they ought\r\nto be, to keep well, that is, when in good growing condition, there\r\nwill be a great weight of tops, sometimes as high as a quarter of the\r\nweight of roots; and this mass of green fodder, coming at a time when\r\nthe fields are usually bare of grasses, will prove very valuable and\r\nacceptable food for the cows.\r\n\r\nIn storing, one fact must be borne in mind; that Carrots will heat,\r\nsprout and rot, under circumstances in which Mangolds would keep\r\nsound and uninjured. I have several times lost quantities when buried\r\nin the ground where Mangolds and common table Beets, under precisely\r\nthe same conditions, have kept perfectly sound. If the crop is to\r\nbe fed at once, they may be dumped into the cellar or barn floor in\r\nthe most expeditious way; but if to be fed into the winter, then all\r\ndepth of the heap above two and a half feet means a proportionate\r\nincrease of danger of heating, sprouting and rotting, and so much\r\ngreater care to air the cellar in cool, dry weather. I need hardly\r\nstate that cellars for keeping Carrots and all roots should be\r\nfree from standing water, and as cool as possible without actually\r\nfreezing. They should not be put directly on the cellar floor,\r\nbut on a platform to admit air under them and it is an excellent\r\nplan to scatter a little sand among them. I find that Carrots keep\r\nexceedingly well if poured (not placed) in a trench 14 inches wide\r\nand 2½ feet deep, to be covered slightly at first and more as cold\r\nincreases, so that they have first a little coarse litter, then a\r\nfoot of earth, and on this about 18 inches of waste or cheap hay.\r\nWhen the roots are large they will keep sufficiently better to pay\r\nfor the extra trouble, if they are piled “heads and points” to the\r\nheight of two and a half feet, with a slight space for air between\r\nthe piles. If there are not cellar conveniences for storing the\r\nentire crop, with a good protection of hay under and around them, a\r\nfew tons may be stored, for early feeding, in the barn, provided it\r\nis not so cold as to freeze them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    RAISING CARROTS WITH ONIONS.\r\n\r\nI transfer from my Treatise on Onions, a paragraph relative to\r\ngrowing Carrots with onions.\r\n\r\nThe plan of raising Carrots with onions is considered an improvement\r\nby some who have adopted it, as the yield of Carrots is thought to\r\nbe clear gain, diminishing but little or none the yield of onions.\r\nCarrots are planted in two ways; one by sowing them in drills between\r\nevery other row of onions, and the other, which is considered an\r\nimprovement, called the Long Island plan, by planting the onions in\r\nhills from seven to eight inches from center to center, dropping\r\na number of seed in each hill, and from the first to the twelfth\r\nof June, planting the Carrot seed, usually by hand, between these\r\nhills in two rows then skipping one, and thus on through the piece.\r\nThe onions, as they are pulled are thrown into every third row, the\r\nCarrots being left to mature. By this method from two to six hundred\r\nbushels of Carrots are raised per acre in addition to the crop of\r\nonions. More manure is required for the two crops than for the onions\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe machine used for sowing in drills has two boxes attached to\r\nthe axle at equi-distance from the wheels; there are three or four\r\nholes in the axle that communicate with the seed in the boxes, and\r\nas these holes pass under the boxes they are filled with seed, and\r\nas they turn the seed are dropped into the earth. Screws are sunk\r\ninto the holes, which can be sunk more or less at pleasure, and the\r\nquantity of seed which the holes will contain is thus graded.\r\n\r\nThe machine should first be tested, and so regulated that on a barn\r\nfloor it will drop from eleven to twelve seed from each hole. When\r\nso regulated, on using in the field it will drop but from seven to\r\ntwelve, owing to the more uneven motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MARKETING AND FEEDING.\r\n\r\nIn the cities there is a large market for Carrots as feed for horses,\r\nit being very generally accepted that a few given daily or every\r\nother day, aids the digestion of grain-fed animals, adds to the\r\ngloss of the hair, and are of special medicinal value. The largest,\r\nsmoothest and darkest orange colored roots sell the best in the\r\nmarket. The price varies all the way from ten to twenty dollars a ton\r\nof 2,000 pounds, depending in part on the value of hay. Where the\r\nquantity fed daily is small, a large knife or a shovel will answer to\r\ncut them up in pieces of suitable size; but if the quantity amounts\r\nto several bushels daily, then a root-cutter will be needed. There\r\nare two classes of these, one for sheep, and the other for large\r\nstock, the essential difference being that those designed to cut\r\nroots for sheep cut into smaller pieces. Of those designed to cut\r\nroots for large stock, the Whittemore machine is as good a machine\r\nas any, having a capacity to cut up a bushel in about half a minute.\r\nAmong farmers there is much unnecessary fear about the danger of\r\nanimals choking while feeding on apples, potatoes and roots. For the\r\nlast ten years I have fed to my cows not far from three hundred tons\r\nof squashes, potatoes and roots, (mostly squashes) and never yet lost\r\nan animal or had any very serious trouble from choking. My habit is\r\nto feed them while quietly in their stalls, with a division board\r\nbetween the feed of each. All cases of choking that have come to my\r\nnotice have occurred _where the animal was suddenly disturbed while\r\neating_. There is a great difference of opinion as to how many roots\r\ncan be fed to stock daily without injuring them. The proportion will\r\ndepend somewhat on the constitutional peculiarities of individual\r\ncows, but when the bowels are all right the appetite of the animal is\r\nprobably the safest guide. I have had a large and extended experience\r\nin feeding squashes to milch cows,--the Boston Marrow, Hubbard and\r\nother varieties; beginning with a half a bushel to each animal, I\r\nincrease the quantity until the daily consumption has averaged a\r\nhundred pounds a day to each. Under such heavy feeding, after a while\r\ntheir appetites clog somewhat, but I am inclined to the opinion\r\nthat beginning with a moderate feed, they would soon readily eat\r\nseventy-five pounds daily with a relish, for as long a period as they\r\nmight last. When feeding Carrots or any roots, the most economical\r\nmethod is to give meadow or salt hay, with a small quantity of\r\nflax-seed or cotton-seed meal. The effect of the roots and these rich\r\nmeals is to give to these inferior varieties of hay, the nutritious\r\nvalue of the best upland English.\r\n\r\nCarrots fed too liberally to horses, will make them soft, and cause\r\nthem to sweat at the least exertion. The manure made by animals fed\r\non Carrots or any other roots is of poor quality and therefore for\r\nthe farm’s (as well as the animal’s) sake a proportion of grain, or\r\nits equivalent, should always be fed with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MANGOLD WURTZELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Mangold Wurtzel? A number of years ago I raised a piece\r\nof Early Turnip Beet seed in a very isolated location; there was\r\nnot another piece of Beet seed growing within half a mile, at\r\nleast. A good deal of the seed wasted, as is usual when the seed is\r\nallowed to ripen well on the stock before cutting. From this waste\r\nseed thousands of young plants sprang up, many of which survived\r\nthe winter, by the help of the protection of chickweed and snow.\r\nThey had got so far along when ploughing time came, I left the\r\npiece unploughed, thinning them out that they might produce early\r\nbeets. As the season advanced a good many of them pushed seed\r\nshoots and ripened a crop of seed. Some of the seed I gathered\r\nand the next season planted it to see what it would produce. The\r\ncrop was “everything;” all the way from a nice, dark colored Early\r\nTurnip Beet, through different sizes, colors and forms, up to a\r\nlight-fleshed Mangold Wurtzel! As the original Beets were a very\r\npure Turnip Beet, and during several years of careful cultivation\r\nfor seed purposes had shown no admixture with any other variety,\r\nthe experiment proved either that the coarse variety of Stock Beet,\r\nwhich we call Mangold Wurtzel are but sports from our fine-grained\r\ntable Beets, or that the Beets class are sports from Mangolds,--most\r\nprobably the former.\r\n\r\nMangold Wurtzels differ from table Beets in their general coarseness\r\nof structure, and the larger size to which they grow, the elements\r\nwhich enter into the composition of each being the same in kind.\r\n\r\nWhat is a Sugar Beet? The term “Sugar Beet” is an unfortunate one,\r\nas the word “Sugar” had already been appropriated to express the\r\nsweet flavor of the varieties of Beets raised for table use, while\r\nthe word Beet is strictly a misnomer, the vegetable Sugar Beet being\r\nin reality a Mangold Wurtzel. A generation ago our fathers used the\r\nterm “Sugar” as a familiar designation for any sweet variety of\r\nbeet raised for table use, and at the present by the great majority\r\nof the public the term is still so used. As the new industry of\r\nmanufacturing sugar from the beet grew on the continent of Europe,\r\nseedsmen were called upon to supply for commerce seed of the best\r\nvariety for this purpose. It was necessary that this variety should\r\nbe as free as possible from all coloring substance as this would,\r\nas a matter of course, give a stain to the juice, and impose on the\r\nmanufacturer the labor of purifying it. The ones at first selected\r\nwere the long, white Mangold Wurtzel, and these were called the\r\n“Sugar” Beet in commercial parlance. These white Mangolds were not\r\nentirely white, the portion that grew above ground being usually\r\ncolored a light green by exposure to the sun’s rays; it became\r\ntherefore an object for the manufacturer to still improve on them to\r\nthe end that all the coloring should be eliminated. The intelligence\r\nand enterprise of the seedsmen of Europe responded to this want, and\r\nin the course of a few years two prominent varieties were produced,\r\nthat have nearly completely satisfied it,--one of these was sent out\r\nby the estimable house of Vilmorin Andrieux & Co., of Paris, and is\r\nnamed “Vilmorin’s New Improved White,” and the other “White Imperial\r\nExtra,” by the distinguished German house of Ernest Benary.\r\n\r\nThese improved Sugar Beets of commerce grow nearly entirely under\r\nground, and when grown these beets define themselves to be the\r\nMangold variety, by the coarser structure of the root, the stouter\r\nribs and the greater coarseness of the leaves, which spring in larger\r\nmasses directly from the crown, than is the case with beets for the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThe moral of all this for my farmer friends is, that if you want a\r\nbeet for table use do not order “Sugar Beet” or you will be very\r\nlikely to find a Mangold growing in your garden, a return, but not a\r\nrecompense for the sweat and toil of the husbandman.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              VARIETIES.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty varieties are catalogued by seedsmen, many of which are\r\nbut strains of the same kind, bearing the name of the grower, who by\r\ncareful cultivation has endeavored to improve it. Classified by form\r\nthey come under three classes, viz.:--the long, the round and the\r\novoid or intermediate varieties. Classified by color we have the red\r\nor scarlet, the pink, the yellow or orange, and the white varieties.\r\n\r\n=The Long Varieties.=--Among the more prominent of these are the\r\nOx Horn, the common Long Red, Norbition Giant, Carter’s Orange\r\nGlobe, and the Silesian varieties of Sugar Beet. The Ox Horn is a\r\nvery crooked growing variety, as its name would imply, with a small\r\ndiameter in proportion to its great length. Growing almost wholly out\r\nof ground it curves about so in the row as to be decidedly in the\r\nway, is apt to break when pulled and in addition to these defects,\r\nstoring very badly, it is not in any way desirable. The Norbiton\r\nGiant, Long Red, Gate Post, and Tankard are improvements over the\r\ncommon Long Red in a greater uniformity in their habit of growth,\r\ntheir size, and a less liability to grow hollow at the top at the\r\nadvanced stage of growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG RED MANGOLD.]\r\n\r\n=The Round Varieties.=--In these are included the common Red and\r\nYellow Globe, Gate Post and Tankard, with some of the underground\r\nvarieties of the Sugar Beet.\r\n\r\n=Ovoid= are either red or yellow in color and are intermediate in\r\nform between the long and the round kinds.\r\n\r\n=What Kinds to Grow.=--In this country the Long Red are the most\r\npopular, particularly the Norbiton Giant variety. While travelling\r\nin England, Ireland and France, for inquiry and observation, I found\r\nthat the round and ovoid varieties were more generally cultivated\r\nthan the long sorts. In my experience the ovoid varieties incline to\r\ngrow smoother than the long kinds and hence are likely to bring up\r\nless earth with them, which on heavy soil is a matter of some moment.\r\nI think of the two kinds the yellow, under the same circumstances,\r\nmakes the larger root. The long varieties pile better in the cellar,\r\nwhile the round or ovoids cut up rather more readily, appear less\r\ninclined to rot at the top, and are firmer fleshed. The globe and\r\novoid varieties appear to be best adapted to hard and shallow soils,\r\nand of these the Yellow Globe and Ovoid are especially valuable, as\r\nthey are better keepers than most sorts and remain sound, without\r\nsprouting, until late into the spring, and with special care may be\r\nkept even into the summer season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVOID MANGOLD.]\r\n\r\nThe long Silesian varieties of Sugar Beet vary from each other only\r\nin the color of the part exposed above ground,--being green, grey\r\nor red. The kind introduced to the American public a few years\r\nago, under the name of Lane’s Improved American Sugar Beet, is a\r\nstrain of Long White Mangold. The improved varieties of Germany and\r\nFrance yield about double the percentage of sugar that is found in\r\nthe common Mangold, in some crops the proportion being as high as\r\nsixteen per cent. This would make the Sugar Beets of double the\r\nvalue of Mangolds for stock, but unfortunately, the roots under like\r\nconditions of cultivation, average but half the weight of Mangolds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLOBE MANGOLD.]\r\n\r\nThe average percentage of sugar found in analysis of beets grown in\r\nthis country is exceptionably high. Having land free from alkalies,\r\nof unbounded fertility, readily accessible, and attainable at almost\r\nnominal cost, it is a serious question why we do not follow the\r\nexample of other countries and raise our own sugar rather than import\r\nit. Our inducement is the home market that the sugar factory would\r\nafford for unlimited areas of beets, while the refuse pulp would\r\nenable farmers to increase greatly the number of their neat stock,\r\nto the advantage of the manure pile and enlargement of their area\r\nof tillage. The great draw back is the price of labor in our own\r\nprosperous country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL AND ITS PREPARATION.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of soil, Mangold Wurtzels will accept a greater\r\nlatitude than any other root; thriving on every variety, all the\r\nway from light loam to muck, and from that to as strong a clay as\r\nis sufficiently friable for tillage. Muck (properly drained) and a\r\nstrong loam are best suited to develop pounds of crop. Though the\r\ncrop grown in the lighter soil is not so great it is much sweeter\r\nthan when grown on heavy soil and when extraordinary quantities\r\nof manure have been applied, some of the heaviest crops on record\r\nhave been grown on light loam. The great crop of Mr. Fearing of\r\nHingham, of over sixty tons to the acre, was raised on a sandy loam.\r\nSome years ago I took a purchaser into the field where two lots of\r\nMangolds were growing; he selected at once the large roots on the low\r\nland. I asked him to taste a slice of those on the upland, when he at\r\nonce changed his preference. As a rule it will be found that those\r\ngrown on warm upland soil are decidedly the sweeter and this fact has\r\nan important bearing on the feeding value of the crop.\r\n\r\nIf the soil is in good heart for a foot in depth, plough it to that\r\ndepth before putting on the manure. After putting on the manure, if\r\ncoarse, it will be well to cut it up with Randall’s wheel-harrow\r\nbefore ploughing under. After cross ploughing the manure four or five\r\ninches beneath the surface the aim should be to make a good seed bed\r\nby getting the surface level and the soil light and fine. On most\r\nsoils this can be accomplished by a liberal use of the wheel-harrow\r\nfollowed by a fine-toothed smoothing harrow and that by a plank\r\ndrag. An old barn door will sometimes answer for this, but as it is\r\nan excellent implement on the farm it will be well to have one. It\r\nshould be about three feet wide and six long, with one side about ten\r\ninches high, meeting the bottom at an angle of forty-five degrees;\r\nthe planks had better overlap slightly, as they will the better\r\nbreak the lumps of earth. The team is to be hitched to the turned up\r\nside, and the driver is to stand on the drag, driving it sideways\r\nover the land. The effect of such a drag in breaking up lumps and\r\ngenerally pulverizing the soil, will be found to be much superior to\r\nthat of any roller. Should the soil be of such a character or in such\r\na condition that the harrow and drag process will not make a good\r\nseed bed, there remains no resource other than to prepare it as for\r\nonions, either raking over the entire surface, or running over it\r\nthree or more times with the Meeker Harrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEEKER HARROW.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANURE AND ITS APPLICATION.\r\n\r\nThe kind and quantities of food needed to grow any vegetables is\r\nfound by an analysis of that vegetable. Having thus learned the\r\nkind and quantity needed for any crop, the next step of the wise\r\nfarmer will be to ascertain what manures contain the necessary\r\nconstituents and which of these contain them in the cheapest form. A\r\nlittle knowledge of Chemistry, in its application to manures, is of\r\nincalculable value to the husbandman and no amount of experience and\r\ntraditionary knowledge can serve as a substitute for it. I believe\r\nthat it is in this direction that the great advance in agriculture\r\nwill be made, and were there no other argument for Agricultural\r\ncolleges the fact that they are prepared to give thorough instruction\r\nin this one department would be a sufficient reason for their\r\nexistence, and for their liberal patronage by their several states.\r\nProf. Voelcker, an excellent authority in everything that pertains\r\nto chemistry, in its application to agriculture, gives the following\r\ntable as the average composition of the ash of the principal root\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|              AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF THE ASH OF ROOTS.               |\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|             |Number of Analyses.                                    |\r\n|             |    |Potash.                                           |\r\n|             |    |     |Soda.                                       |\r\n|             |    |     |     |Lime.                                 |\r\n|             |    |     |     |     |Magnesia.                       |\r\n|             |    |     |     |     |    |Oxide of Iron.             |\r\n|             |    |     |     |     |    |    |Phosphoric Acid.      |\r\n|             |    |     |     |     |    |    |     |Sulphuric Acid. |\r\n|             |    |     |     |     |    |    |     |     |Silica.   |\r\n|             |    |     |     |     |    |    |     |     |    |Chlorine.\r\n+-------------+----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+-----+-----+----+-----+\r\n| TURNIPS.    | 38 | 49.8|  7.8| 11.7| 2.6| 0.9| 10.3| 11.8| 1.2|  5.0|\r\n| SWEDES.     |  7 | 38.9| 14.0| 12.8| 4.2| 0.8| 10.4| 13.7| 1.9|  4.2|\r\n| MANGOLDS.   | 12 | 46.6| 18.4|  5.9| 4.8| 0.8|  8.3|  3.7| 4.0|  9.9|\r\n| SUGAR BEET. | 40 | 48.0| 10.4|  6.4| 9.5| 1.0| 14.4|  4.7| 3.8|  2.3|\r\n| CARROTS.    | 10 | 37.0| 20.7| 10.9| 5.2| 1.0| 11.2|  6.9| 2.0|  4.9|\r\n| PARSNIPS.   |  4 | 46.7|  2.7| 15.7| 6.0| 1.3| 15.8|  5.6| 2.4|  4.0|\r\n+-------------+----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+-----+-----+----+-----+\r\n|                               LEAF ASH.                             |\r\n+-------------+----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+-----+-----+----+-----+\r\n| TURNIPS.    | 37 | 27.6|  5.1| 33.2| 2.6| 2.0|  7.3| 13.1| 3.5|  7.7|\r\n| SWEDES.     |  3 | 21.9| 12.3| 30.2| 3.2| 2.0|  6.4| 10.6| 4.8| 11.0|\r\n| MANGOLDS.   |  4 | 25.5| 23.3| 10.4| 9.7| 1.2|  5.4|  7.2| 3.3| 17.8|\r\n| SUGAR BEET. |  7 | 21.9| 16.6| 19.5|18.1| 1.3|  7.3|  7.9| 3.1|  5.7|\r\n| CARROTS.    |  7 | 17.6| 18.2| 32.1| 3.9| 3.0|  3.8|  8.2| 5.2|  8.9|\r\n+-------------+----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+-----+-----+----+-----+\r\n\r\nThis table shows us that the Mangolds require the mineral ingredients\r\nof manure in the following order, when arranged with reference to\r\ntheir importance:--Potash, Soda, Chlorine, Lime, Phosphoric Acid,\r\nMagnesia, Sulphuric Acid, Silica. In addition to these minerals\r\nother substances enter into the composition of Mangolds, the most\r\nimportant of which is Nitrogen. Barn-yard manure contains about\r\nall the elements needed by vegetation, but not always in the right\r\nproportion, therefore, when applying it, it is always profitable to\r\nknow the proportions of the minerals which enter into crops that the\r\ndeficiency may be supplied from other sources. It is perhaps hardly\r\nnecessary to say that unleached wood ashes and the German Potash\r\nSalts, Sulphate and Muriate, are the cheapest sources for Potash at\r\npresent known, while Soda and Chlorine are obtained from Muriate\r\nof Potash or from the waste salt of the fisheries. Of this I shall\r\nhave more to say presently when treating of salt as an auxiliary\r\nfertilizer. Lime is obtained from the common Carbonate of Lime of the\r\nmason, either water or air slacked, and this usually contains more\r\nor less of Magnesia, or from wood ashes which is largely one-third\r\nlime. The great source of Phosphoric Acid is the bones of animals\r\nor corprolites, by which is meant the fossilized bones and dung\r\nof extinct animals; Sulphuric Acid is most cheaply obtained from\r\nPlaster, which is Sulphate of Lime.\r\n\r\nSome hold great benefit is derived by the crop of the following year,\r\nfrom ploughing under the leaves as soon as the roots are topped; the\r\nvalue of this is just what the analyses of our table shows. The large\r\ncrops reported as raised in this country, have been raised on soil\r\nranging from light to a friable clay loam and have received all the\r\nway from eight to fifteen cords of barn-yard manure to the acre. In\r\nsome instances this has been all ploughed in; in others half spread\r\nbroadcast and ploughed in and the other half put in the furrows. When\r\ncoarse and unfermented I would advise a deep ploughing of it under,\r\nin the Fall as with Carrots; other waste substances can be used as\r\nsubstitutes for barn-yard manure, care being taken either that such\r\nwaste substances are specially rich in Potash, Soda and Chlorine, or\r\nthat these substances be added. The equivalents given are roughly\r\nestimated under the article treating of the manure for Carrots\r\nand will be sufficient for practical purposes; I therefore make\r\nno further allusions to these cheap wastes as sources for manure,\r\nfurther than to mention that sea manures are specially rich in potash\r\nand soda.\r\n\r\nOf all roots Mangolds are the rankest feeders, removing more plant\r\nfood from the soil than any other root crop. The crop of Mr. Albert\r\nFearing, of Hingham, Mass., was sixty tons of roots, and if the tops\r\nwere in the usual proportion, of about one-third, they weighed twenty\r\ntons more, giving the enormous yield of eighty-tons of green food\r\nfrom one acre of ground. The crop raised on Deer Island, in Boston\r\nharbor, was about seventy tons to the acre; with a like proportion\r\nof tops the total yield must have been over a hundred tons. In the\r\nsewage farms of England eighty tons of roots have been raised on an\r\nacre of ground. Fearing applied fifteen cords of manure to his acre\r\nof ground; of the quantity applied to the Deer Island crop I regret I\r\nhave not the data at hand.\r\n\r\nIf the mere bulk alone was to be aimed at in the crop, the problem\r\nwould be a very simple one, but there are three points to be\r\nconsidered: first, how to get a crop that shall be great in bulk\r\nand at the same time give us the second desirable point, viz.:\r\n_ripeness_, and thus insure the third desirable point, viz.: _the\r\nhighest percentage of sugar it is possible for the roots to acquire_.\r\n\r\nThis matter of the value of Mangolds, for feeding purposes, being in\r\nabout the same proportion as the sugar present, though appertaining\r\nto that part of this Treatise which treats of “Feeding to Stock,”\r\nyet has so direct a bearing on the manuring of the crops that I will\r\ntake it up at this place. The recent researches of that distinguished\r\nchemist, Prof. Voelcker of England, than whom there is no better\r\nauthority, has thrown much light on the question of manure in its\r\napplication to this crop. The Professor takes the position that the\r\nnutritious value of roots is in proportion to the amount of dry\r\nmatter in them, and that the percentage of sugar present coincides\r\nwith that of dry matter, the proportion of sugar rising or falling\r\nwith the percentage of dry matter in the roots. That the feeding\r\nvalue does not depend on the proportion of nitrogen they contain, is\r\nproved theoretically, by the fact that the percentage is very much\r\nhigher in the early stages of growth, before the crop is matured,\r\nthan it is later in the season, while in the experiments of Mr. Lawes\r\nin feeding sheep, the lot containing the most nitrogen in the way of\r\nnutrition gave the poorest results.\r\n\r\nAssuming with Prof. Voelcker that bulk should not be sought at a\r\ndisproportionate sacrifice of sugar in the crop, and that certain\r\nsoils and certain manures and certain methods of cultivation are\r\nmore favorable than others to the development of this desirable\r\nproportion. I present extracts from his valuable article on “Root\r\nCrops as affected by Soil and Manures.”\r\n\r\n“Land highly manured with rich dung from the fattening boxes or\r\nstables, induces luxurious and vigorous growth in root crops, and,\r\nas is well known, has a tendency to develop over-luxuriance in the\r\ntops. This is the case more particularly if the dung is derived from\r\nfattening beasts, liberally supplied with oil-cake and artificial\r\nfood, rich in nitrogenous constituents. If the Autumn turns out\r\nfairly dry and warm, the roots in highly manured land continue to\r\ngrow vigorously, the bulbs swell to a large dimension, and if the\r\nweather in September and October continues warm and dry, a heavy\r\nweight, and fairly ripe roots, result from the liberal use of rich\r\ndung. But should the Autumn be cold and wet, too liberal application\r\nof good, well-rotten dung is apt to maintain the luxuriant tops in a\r\nvigorous, active-growing condition, at a period of the year when the\r\ncrop has to be taken up, and the result is an immature root crop,\r\nof a low feeding value. Although the bulbs may be of a good size,\r\nthey turn out, when grown under such conditions, watery, deficient\r\nin sugar, and not nearly as nutritious as they would have been had\r\na more moderate dressing of dung been put upon the land. The main\r\ncause of the immature condition and low-feeding quality of Mangolds\r\ngrown with an excessive quantity of rich dung is the comparatively\r\nlarge amount of ammonial and nitrogenous constituents in the dung;\r\nfor numerous field experiments have shown that the peculiar tendency\r\nof ammonia salts, and of readily available nitrogenous substances\r\nis to induce luxuriant leaf-development and vigorous and prolonged\r\ngrowth, which results frequently in a more or less immature condition\r\nof the roots. There is thus danger of over-manuring crops; and the\r\ndesire to produce heavy crops of Mangolds not unfrequently leads\r\npractical men not to appreciate sufficiently this danger. It is\r\nquite true Mangolds are very greedy feeders, and no doubt some\r\nsoils will swallow up almost any amount of dung; but at the same\r\ntime it has to be borne in mind that all land is not alike, and\r\nthat there are many naturally rich clay loams containing immense\r\nstores of plant food which requires only to be brought into play\r\nby good cultivation in order to become available to plants. I am\r\nmuch inclined to think that it is a mistake to manure soils of the\r\nlatter description too liberally with dung, even for Mangolds, and\r\nthat in many cases a more economical result, and certainly a better\r\nquality of Mangolds, although not so heavy a crop, would be given,\r\nif instead of all the enormous dressings of dung which are often\r\napplied to that crop, the lands were manured in Autumn with only\r\nhalf the quantity of dung, and the seed drilled in with three to\r\nfour cwt. of superphosphate or dissolved bones, which manures, as\r\nwe shall see presently have a tendency to produce early maturity in\r\nroots. We frequently hear of complaints that Mangolds scour, or do\r\nnot keep well. Complaints of this kind are only expressions in other\r\nwords for the immature condition of the roots, and in many cases the\r\ncause of this undesirable condition has to be sought in the excessive\r\namount of ammonial or nitrogenous constituents which are applied\r\nto the Mangolds in the shape of heavy dressings of dung. The same\r\nremarks apply with equal force to the exclusive and to abundant use\r\nof sulphate of ammonia, nitrate of soda, and nitrogenous manures\r\nin general. The special effect of all ammonial and nitrogenous\r\nmanures in general, as already stated, is to produce luxuriant leaf\r\ndevelopment, to induce prolonged and vigorous growth, resulting in an\r\nimmature and watery condition of the bulbs.\r\n\r\n“Large roots, generally speaking, are far less nutritious than\r\nbetter matured roots of a moderate size. For illustration of this\r\nfact I quote the following comparative analyses:\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    |                      |Water.                              |\r\n    |                      |       |Nitrogenous Constituents.   |\r\n    |                      |       |      |Sugar, Pectine, &c.  |\r\n    |                      |       |      |       |Crude Fibre. |\r\n    |                      |       |      |       |      | Ash. |\r\n    +----------------------+-------+------+-------+------+------+\r\n    | Mangolds 9 lbs.      | 91.85 | 1.34 |  2.86 | 2.54 | 1.41 |\r\n    |    “     7½ lbs.     | 89.48 | 1.24 |  3.95 | 4.51 |  .82 |\r\n    |    “     4 lbs.      | 89.77 | 0.73 |  7.68 |  .89 |  .93 |\r\n    |    “     1 to 2 lbs. | 86.90 | 0.61 | 10.51 | 1.07 |  .91 |\r\n    +----------------------+-------+------+-------+------+------+\r\n\r\n“Small Mangolds approach Sugar Beets in composition, whilst large\r\nSugar Beets are hardly better than common Mangolds, and monster beets\r\nare even less nutritious than well-matured Mangolds of fair average\r\nsize. Monster roots, as is well known, are always very watery, poor\r\nin sugar, and almost useless for feeding purposes.\r\n\r\n“Big Berkshire beets,--one weighing 16 pounds and the other 12¼\r\npounds,--contained only 3.89 or 4 per cent. of sugar respectively,\r\nand in round numbers as much as 91½ per cent. of water. This high\r\npercentage of water is accompanied by a larger amount of albuminous\r\ncompounds and of mineral matter, than the proportions in roots,\r\ncontaining very much more solid feeding matter. A large amount of\r\nalbuminous matter and of ash, indeed indicates immaturity and poverty\r\nin sugar, a characteristic of big, excessively manured roots.\r\n\r\n“Generally speaking, all nitrogenous manure, either should not be\r\nused at all, or only sparingly, for roots, on stiffish land, and\r\nall soils which contain a good deal of clay, are naturally cold and\r\nunfavorable to a vigorous and rapid growth. Light land, like most\r\nproductive sandy soils and friable turnip loams, favors the quick\r\nand vigorous growth of roots, and is conducive to early maturity.\r\n\r\n“Nitrate of soda has the same general effect upon root crops as\r\nnitrogenous manures, but it appears to be more energetic in its\r\naction, and, on the whole, to be a useful addition to home manures,\r\nand to increase the produce in roots more considerably than sulphate\r\nof ammonia. Its effect is specially marked upon Mangolds, and, to my\r\nknowledge, heavy crops of Mangolds have been produced upon rather\r\nlight land by 1 1-2 cwt. of Nitrate of Soda, two cwt. of common salt,\r\nsown broadcast, and four cwt. of dissolved bones drilled in with the\r\nseed.\r\n\r\n“Potash salts in some field experiments which I have tried in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, have shown that Potash has a\r\ndecidedly beneficial effect upon root crops, on poor, sandy soils;\r\nwhile on the majority of land, and notably upon clays or clay\r\nloams, or soils in a good agricultural condition, Salts of Potash\r\ndo not increase the produce. The special effect of superphosphates,\r\ndissolved bones and similar phosphatic manures, is to produce early\r\nmaturity; and hence phosphatic manures are employed in practice very\r\nlargely, and with much benefit, by root growers. In free-growing,\r\nlight soils, it is desirable either to use dissolved bones in\r\naddition to half dressing of farm-yard manure, as a manure for roots,\r\nor to spread broadcast 2 or 3 cwt. of salt, or 2 cwt. of guano and 1\r\ncwt. of nitrate of soda and 2 cwt. of common salt, and to drill with\r\nthe seed 3 to 4 cwt. of dissolved bones. On the heavier description\r\nof soils it is preferable to use mineral superphosphate for roots,\r\nespecially if the land has been dressed in Autumn with a moderate\r\nquantity of dung.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT AS AN AUXILIARY MANURE.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the table of analysis of roots, that the Mangold\r\nhas in it a remarkably large percentage of Chlorine and Soda, the\r\nroots yielding respectively 9.9 and 18.4, while the tops give, 17.8\r\nand 23.3. Salt being a combination of Chlorine and Soda, known\r\nto chemists as Chloride of Sodium, must therefore be a valuable\r\nauxiliary manure for Mangolds, that is, one to be used in connection\r\nwith other manures. Practice proves what chemistry indicates. Prof.\r\nVoelcker tells us that “salt tends to check over-luxuriance in the\r\ntops, while it prolongs the period of active growth. In consequence\r\nof this specific action it may be employed with benefit as an\r\nauxiliary manure upon light land, in quantities not greater than\r\nfive bushels to the acre.” Mr. Lewes, of New York, believes that by\r\nscattering over the surface, when the Mangolds develop the fourth\r\nleaf, four or five bushels of the refuse of the Syracuse salt works,\r\nwhich is about equal parts of salt and plaster, he has increased his\r\ncrop ten tons to the acre. Mr. Lewes finds that salt tends to prevent\r\na disease which sometimes attacks the leaves, known as “rust.” He\r\nstates that it can be obtained at the works for about $3.50 per ton.\r\nProf. Voelcker believes it would be injurious rather than beneficial\r\non heavy land.\r\n\r\nThe quantity to be applied to the acre as given by practical\r\ngrowers, varies from four to twenty-five bushels. The effect is\r\nnot always the same; one season the increase may be very striking\r\nand the next, under the same application, not be perceptible, the\r\ncause of which is not very clear, though it appears to give better\r\nresults in dry seasons than in wet. The most striking effect from\r\nthe application of large quantities, in my experience, has been on\r\nthe borders of meadow land. A number of years ago I manured in the\r\nfurrow with refuse herring bait, salt and all, just as taken from\r\nthe fish barrels. The crop of Mangolds grown from this manuring was\r\none of the largest and smoothest I ever raised. The next season the\r\nland was planted to Oats. In the Fall, while laying a heap of this\r\noat straw in the barn, I chanced to use one as a tooth-pick. It\r\ntasted as though it had been pickled; thinking it was the result of\r\nsome accident, I took another; that also was salt. This aroused my\r\ncuriosity and on examination I found farther, to my great surprise,\r\nthat all the straw tasted as though it had been dipped in pretty\r\nstrong brine. Certainly this tremendous salting, over and above what\r\nthe crop of Mangolds could use, to all appearance, had not lessened\r\nthe bulk of roots. On meadow land, Mr. Ware of this town, thinks that\r\nin a dry season he doubled his crop by the application of refuse\r\nsalt, at the rate of twenty-five bushels to the acre. In purchasing\r\nwaste salt for this or any other agricultural crop, it is best to get\r\nthe dirtiest lot possible, for this dirt is the waste of the fish on\r\nwhich it has been used, and consists mostly of fish scales, which for\r\nmanuring purposes is decidedly the most valuable part of the fish.\r\nFor this reason the waste from salted herring is probably the most\r\nvaluable of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n               PLANTING THE SEED AND TENDING THE CROP.\r\n\r\nOur ground being now ready the next step is to plant it: How much\r\nseed shall we need and how far apart shall we have the rows? The very\r\nbest of seed is often disappointing in the matter of vegetating, and\r\nit is therefore best to plant with a liberal hand, for it is better\r\nto have to thin out than not have plants enough. From six to ten\r\npounds of seed is the quantity used, the larger quality when planted\r\nfor sugar purposes, the object in view being to get an even stand\r\nwith all the roots the same distance apart, to attain which a great\r\ndeal of thinning is necessary. As to the proper distance between\r\nthe rows, practical growers will give various replies;--18, 20, 22,\r\n24, 30 inches. The thirty inch men are those who expect to depend\r\non the cultivator to do about all their weeding. That the crop does\r\nnot require so much room to yield the greatest bulk, is shown by the\r\nexperience of other cultivators, who have raised from forty to over\r\nsixty tons to the acre, with their rows from eighteen to twenty-two\r\ninches apart, while the greatest, crop on record, viz.:--of over\r\neighty tons to the acre, was raised with the rows twenty-four inches\r\napart.\r\n\r\nPlanting on ridges is often advised, but as far as I have observed,\r\nthose who begin this way generally change to the system of level\r\nculture as they advance in experience. The only advantages I have\r\nfound in the system of ridge cultivation have been that the Mangolds\r\nappear to grow with fewer roots, and are rather more easily weeded.\r\nThese advantages in practice are more than off-set by the extra labor\r\nof making the ridges and preparing them for planting. Mangold seed\r\nis apt to come up badly. In France, where land is cut up into small\r\nareas and labor is cheap, one would expect to find as little waste as\r\npossible, but while travelling there I noted in their fields that the\r\nMangolds were quite scattering. Mangold seed, like those of beets,\r\nare enclosed in a porous shell which itself is usually called the\r\nseed. By cracking these “seeds” the real seed will be found within,\r\nat the angles, from one to four in number, and when broken, if fresh,\r\nappear as white as flour. One reason why a portion of the seed fails\r\nto vegetate, is, I infer, from the quantity of moisture necessary to\r\nreach and swell the encased seed. For this reason, if planted during\r\ndry spells, care should be taken to get them down to a good depth,\r\nsay an inch and a half deep, and then to pack the fine earth closely\r\nover them so that it may hold the moisture. Any machine, therefore,\r\nthat is used for planting should have a good roller. To facilitate\r\nand hasten the vegetation, some cultivators practice soaking the\r\nseed, by pouring on water when almost at a scalding temperature, and\r\nletting the seed remain in it from thirty-six to forty-eight hours,\r\nbeing careful to keep it where the water will not fall below blood\r\nheat, then rolling plaster or dry soil, until it is sufficiently dry\r\nto drop readily from the machine.\r\n\r\nSome prefer to plant by hand, believing that the greater certainty\r\nof getting the seed up and the greater regularity of the plants in\r\nthe row is more than an off-set to the additional labor. In doing\r\nthis some growers will drop the seed on the surface by the machine,\r\nand then follow and push them under to the depth requisite, with the\r\nthumb and finger; others use a strip of plank about four inches wide\r\nand three feet in length, on the under side of which are inserted\r\nwooden pins, every seven inches, the pins being one and a quarter\r\ninches in diameter and projecting two inches. The holes having been\r\nmade, the seed are dropped in, and covered by the hand. Where blanks\r\nare found they may be profitably filled by transplanting the young\r\nMangolds, care being taken to break off the tops of the larger\r\nleaves, and also to loosen the ground a little when planting them.\r\nIf a time just after a shower is selected, the result will be very\r\nsatisfactory. The transplanted roots when gathered in the Fall will\r\nusually be found with several small roots in place of a single tap\r\nroot.\r\n\r\nAll root crops require prompt and thorough attention in the matter of\r\nweeding, and to lessen this costly department of labor they should\r\nnot be raised on land abounding in the seed of weeds. Mangolds will\r\nrequire two or three hand weedings, besides as many slidings with\r\nthe scuffle or wheelhoe. If too thick they should be thinned rather\r\nearly in their growth, for I have oftentimes noticed that if this is\r\nleft until the roots begin to develop, those left standing are apt\r\nto be dwarfed. It is best to give two thinnings. The plants should\r\nbe left from ten to twelve inches apart; the crop of eighty tons was\r\nthinned to twelve inches apart and as the roots are more apt to grow\r\ncoarse and prongy, and with less sugar in them, when far apart, I am\r\ninclined to ten or twelve inches as far enough. The object aimed at\r\nshould be, as Prof. Voelcker has shown, to get the weight in many\r\nroots of medium size rather than in fewer roots of large size.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   GATHERING AND STORING THE CROP.\r\n\r\nUnlike other roots, the keeping qualities of Mangolds are destroyed\r\nby a temperature low enough to but little more than freeze the\r\nsurface of the ground. In the late Fall when the growth is about\r\ncompleted, these much exposed roots have but few leaves to protect\r\nthem and hence, where freezing weather is feared, the provident\r\nfarmer will always give them the benefit of the doubt. If he is so\r\nunfortunate as to have his crop injured, let him at once get the\r\nmost he can out of them, in the way of food, for though the injury\r\nat first may appear to be but trivial, the part frozen will become\r\nfirst corky and afterwards turn black, and ultimately rot. If but\r\nslightly frozen the frost may be taken out by at once covering the\r\nroots temporarily with earth, but such roots must be fed early or\r\nthey will rot. Where the globe or ovoid varieties are grown, on land\r\nwhere they pull hard they may be lifted by running a subsoil plough\r\nwith care. In pulling these, or any roots that are to be topped on\r\nthe field, don’t do, as is usually done, either scatter them on\r\nthe surface, without any system, or throw them into heaps, as in\r\neither way the cost of removing the tops is increased. If thrown\r\nin piles the tops become more or less intermingled, and the small\r\namount of extra labor thereby caused in topping each individual root\r\nbecomes great in the aggregate, when thousands are handled. Still it\r\noftentimes happens that the weather takes a sudden, unexpected turn,\r\nthreatening too low a temperature for the safety of the crop; under\r\nsuch circumstances the question is how to get it out of danger in the\r\nmost expeditious way possible. The quickest way is to pull and throw\r\ninto heaps, _roots in, tops out_, by which arrangement, should there\r\nbe considerable of a freeze up, the tops would shield the roots. To\r\nprotect them still more effectually earth may be shovelled over the\r\nheaps, so as barely to cover them, and when protected in this way\r\nthey may be allowed to remain quite awhile awaiting the leisure of\r\nthe farmer. Here let me say that this plan of protection will not\r\nanswer for all crops, as I have learnt with Cabbages, to my sorrow,\r\nfor when covered up this way, but for a few days, when taken out\r\nthey will be found to be almost cooked by the great heat which they\r\nhave developed.\r\n\r\nIn gathering all roots the great object is to have as few handlings\r\nas possible, hence, if the tops are not twisted off as the Mangolds\r\nare pulled, they should be laid in rows, tops in and roots out, four\r\nor more rows being put in one. It will be best to have two hands work\r\ntogether, and so make two of these rows, leaving a small passage-way\r\nbetween them, the roots being on the inside. Now let the topper\r\nfollow with a large and sharp knife, and lop off the leaves to his\r\nright and left as he goes, being careful to so top the roots that\r\neach individual leaf will fall separately, which means that he is\r\nnot to cut the top of the root itself, for unlike Carrots, Mangolds\r\nso cut are apt to decay when stored. For economical work the knife\r\nshould be a large and somewhat heavy one, the blade eight or nine\r\ninches in length. A small grit stone for the use of the hands engaged\r\nin topping any kind of roots is always a good investment; is saves\r\nrunning to the barn for an occasional touch on the grindstone.\r\n\r\nIf the roots are to be marketed they will need to be left to have the\r\nearth on them dry, that it may fall off when loading, but if for use\r\non the farm it will be rather of an advantage, as it will help keep\r\nthem from wilting. The portion of the crop to be fed before Spring\r\nshould be stored as near to the place of feeding as possible. The\r\ngreat object should be to keep them sufficiently covered and cool\r\nto prevent wilting. As all the beet family are good keepers, there\r\nneed be but a small per cent. of loss. Store them in a cool, rather\r\nmoist cellar, provided it has no standing water. The heap may be\r\nthree or four feet in depth, and should be covered with earth that\r\nis rather moist than otherwise, to prevent evaporation. The long\r\nvarieties may be piled cordwood fashion. Those to be fed after Spring\r\nopens can be kept in a pit, dug in gravelly soil, on a hill-side, or\r\nwhere there is no danger from standing water; the pit may be three or\r\nfour feet in depth, and be filled to the surface. In covering there\r\nare two methods: one, to throw the earth directly on the roots, and\r\nthe other to first cover them with cornstalks, or some dry, coarse\r\nlitter before throwing on the earth. In practice I find that when\r\nthe litter is used the roots in immediate contract with it are apt\r\nto mould, more or less, and be affected with a dry rot, though it is\r\nan excellent plan to throw over coarse litter up to severe freezing\r\nweather. Which ever course is pursued it is best not to throw on\r\nmore at first than is sufficient to barely cover them, and to add\r\nthe remainder, making a covering of about two feet in depth in all;\r\nto which is to be added a foot of coarse hay as the weather becomes\r\ncold. The process of thatching with straw and so piling that there\r\nshall be a roof-like slant to the heap, with furnace-like ventilators\r\nopening from it at intervals, I have never found necessary in actual\r\npractice, the elevation of the earth above the bed being a sufficient\r\nwater shed, while the cold nature of the root prevents heating. Rats\r\nare the great enemies of root pits. I have had galleries cut by these\r\nvermin through a bed of roots, utterly destroying them for seed\r\npurposes. The best way of killing them in my experience, has been to\r\ndrop a little arsenic on buttered bread and put it conveniently near\r\ntheir holes, but so far hidden that no neighbor’s dog would be likely\r\nto suffer by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FEEDING THE CROP.\r\n\r\nBesides arguments which are of weight for cultivation of all kind\r\nof roots, there are special ones for the raising of Mangolds. The\r\nvast bulk of yield exceeds that of any annual crop as high as eighty\r\ntons of roots having been raised to the acre on the sewerage farms\r\nof England and when to this is added the weight of leaves that such\r\na crop would carry, it will be safe to say that a hundred tons have\r\nbeen given to the acre. Taken as a whole the Mangold has less enemies\r\nand is less apt to fail than any other root. Compared with the Turnip\r\nfamily, it has several marked advantages, being more reliable in dry\r\nseasons and less liable to disease; and in flesh-forming heat-giving\r\nand fat-producing elements it surpasses it. While the Turnip family\r\ncannot be raised repeatedly on the same land, indeed on most soil\r\ncan be raised only intervals of three or four years, Mangolds can\r\nbe raised many years in succession, as Mr. Mechi, the distinguished\r\nEnglish agriculturist, has proved by raising sixty tons per annum\r\non the same tract of land of six acres area, for six successive\r\nyears. They will keep longer in good condition than any other root,\r\nunder favorable circumstances even as late as July. Experiments in\r\nfeeding steers made with care, proved that while a ton of Mangolds\r\nincreased their weight sixty-five pounds, a ton of Swede increased\r\ntheir weight but forty-eight pounds, equal quantities of hay having\r\nbeen fed in each experiment. Other experiments have established about\r\nthe same proportionate value between these two roots, though the\r\ngeneral result was not as favorable. Mangolds, like fruit, undergo a\r\nripening change after they are gathered, and until this is effected\r\nthey are not in the best condition for feeding. The ripening process\r\nfor the most part consists in a change of starch into sugar, and\r\nmakes the Mangolds both more healthful and more nutritious food.\r\nBefore this change is effected they are apt to scour stock if fed\r\nto any degree liberally. The time when this chemical change takes\r\nplace will depend on the degree of ripeness of the crop when stored;\r\nand this, as has been clearly shown, is affected by both the soil\r\non which they grew and the manure with which they were fed; other\r\nconditions equal, those grown on upland ripen earlier than those on\r\nlowland, while rank manures tend to prolong the period of growth and\r\ncrops so grown come into condition for feeding later in the season.\r\nIn England, a common practice is to begin feeding the Mangolds at\r\nChristmas, while in this country the middle of January is considered\r\nearly enough. Experiments carefully made have proved that when fed to\r\nfattening animals they should follow and not precede Turnips. It is\r\na good rule in feeding this as with other roots or tubers, to begin\r\nwith a small quantity and gradually increase the amount up to the\r\nlimit which the appetite of the cow, her general health and the tale\r\nof the milk pail indicate. Every farmer who feeds a dairy needs a\r\nroot cutter. There are several of these in the market, some designed\r\nfor sheep only, which cut the roots into small pieces, others for\r\nneat cattle, while some manufactured by our Canada neighbors can be\r\narranged to cut for either class of stock. As good a one as I know of\r\nfor stock purposes, cheapness, durability and effectiveness combined,\r\nis one sometimes known as the Ames machine of which I present an\r\nengraving. This machine is capable of cutting about two bushels a\r\nminute. Experiments in England have shown that 59 pounds of cooked\r\nMangolds are equal to 70 of uncooked. Leaves of Mangolds should be\r\nfed with care as they are more apt to scour than those of any other\r\nroot. The reason of this is that they contain comparatively a large\r\nquantity of a poisonous acid known by chemists as “oxalic” acid, the\r\nsame that is developed in Rhubarb leaves, when slightly wilted, and\r\nwhich sometimes causes death when such leaves are eaten as “greens.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMES CUTTER.]\r\n\r\nThe practice sometimes followed in Europe, of feeding the leaves of\r\nthe growing crop, where labor is very cheap, is thought to pay, as\r\nthe leaves are gathered just as they begin to drop from their upright\r\nposition and when their usefulness as nourishers of the root have\r\nended. But with labor as cheap as may be, there is no economy in\r\nthis, for, aside from the deleterious effects to animals, when fed\r\ntoo liberally, by actual experiment it has been found that the wear\r\nand tear to the crop, incidental to the plucking of these leaves by\r\nan average farm hand, injures it more than the value of the leaves\r\nafter they are gathered.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the enormous bulk that an acre will produce in\r\nroots when compared with its yield in hay or grain, there would\r\nbe a serious argument against the growing of them to any extent\r\nbeyond what might be needed for medicinal purposes, in the fact that\r\nthe manure made from them is of so low a value; and the practical\r\nweight of this argument would grow in proportion as farmers acquire\r\na knowledge of the most important department of farming. To most\r\nfarmers a cord or load of manure of cow or horse, is a cord or load\r\nof equal value; now this is far, very far from being the fact, as\r\nwill be seen by the following table which I take from the _Scientific\r\nFarmer_, compiled by the celebrated Mr. Lewes, who, by his careful\r\nexperiments, has laid the agricultural world under lasting\r\nobligation. In this table a ton of English hay is taken as the\r\nstandard and were all the manure saved, both solid and liquid, from a\r\nton of each of these varieties of food, the ingredients at the market\r\nvalue of the Ammonia, Potash and Phosphoric Acid would be worth as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    Hay,                               $10.00\r\n    Clover Hay,                         15.00\r\n    Oat Straw,                           4.50\r\n    Wheat Straw,                         4.16\r\n    Barley Straw,                        3.50\r\n    Decorticated Cotton Seed Cake,      43.33\r\n    Linseed Cake,                       30.66\r\n    Malt Dust,                          28.33\r\n    Malt,                               10.50\r\n    Oats,                               11.50\r\n    Wheat,                              11.00\r\n    Indian Corn,                        10.50\r\n    Barley,                              9.83\r\n    Potatoes,                            2.33\r\n    Mangolds,                            1.66\r\n    Swedes,                              1.41\r\n    Turnips, (common,)                   1.33\r\n    Carrots,                             1.33\r\n\r\nThis table is very suggestive in many ways:--by it we see that\r\nthere are varieties of food, the manure from which is worth more\r\nthan the cost of the food itself. In its application to the feeding\r\nof Mangolds, it at a glance suggests the wisdom of feeding at the\r\nsame time a portion of something richer and more concentrated. By\r\nso doing the quality of the manure is vastly improved and the crops\r\nwill not be slow to discover it. There is still another reason for\r\nfeeding these rich foods while using roots; it enables the farmer to\r\nfeed with profit his straw or inferior varieties of hay. Says Prof.\r\nStockhardt, “The full benefit to animals derivable from feeding roots\r\nis secured only when the proper proportion of substances rich in\r\nnitrogen are fed with them; accordingly, about two pounds of oil-cake\r\nshould be fed with each hundred pounds of beet root, or other foods\r\nmay be substituted in the same proportion as they are rich in\r\nnitrogen.”\r\n\r\nRecent researches have determined a fact of great value to\r\nagriculture: that to get the most profitable results from food the\r\nAlbuminoid and Carbohydrate elements should bear a certain proportion\r\nto each other, and that while a decrease in either of them from this\r\nproper proportion means insufficient food, and a consequent loss\r\nof flesh, fat or milk, an excess of either means money wasted. The\r\nproportion for cows that are dry and oxen when not at work is about\r\none of Albuminoids to eight of Carbohydrates; for oxen at work and\r\ncows in milk, one of Albuminoids to from four to six of Carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nThe following table taken from Prof. Johnson’s excellent work, “How\r\nCrops Grow,” gives the proportion of the Albuminoids, Carbohydrates\r\nand other elements in roots and tubers.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                            |Water.                        |\r\n  |                            |    |Organic Matter.          |\r\n  |                            |    |    |Ash.                |\r\n  |                            |    |    |   |Albuminoids.    |\r\n  |                            |    |    |   |   |Carbohydrates.\r\n  |                            |    |    |   |   |    |Crude Fibre.\r\n  |                            |    |    |   |   |    |   |Fat, &c.\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |     ROOTS AND TUBERS.                                     |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |POTATO.                     |95.0|24.1|0.9|2.0|21.0|1.1|0.3|\r\n  |JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE.        |80.0|18.9|1.1|2.0|15.6|1.3|0.5|\r\n  |KOHL-RABI.                  |83.0|10.8|1.2|2.3| 7.3|1.2|0.2|\r\n  |FIELD BEETS (3 lbs. weight).|88.0|11.1|0.9|1.1| 9.1|0.9|0.1|\r\n  |SUGAR BEETS (1 to 2 lbs.).  |81.5|17.7|0.8|1.0|15.4|1.3|0.1|\r\n  |RUTA BAGAS (about 3 lbs.).  |87.0|12.0|1.0|1.6| 9.3|1.1|0.1|\r\n  |CARROT (about ½ lb.).       |85.0|14.0|1.0|1.5|10.8|1.7|0.2|\r\n  |GIANT CARROT (1 to 2 lbs.). |87.0|12.2|0.8|1.2| 9.8|1.2|0.2|\r\n  |TURNIPS.                    |92.0| 7.2|0.8|1.1| 5.1|1.0|0.1|\r\n  |PARSNIP.                    |88.3|11.0|0.7|1.6| 8.4|1.0|0.2|\r\n  |PUMPKIN.                    |94.5| 4.5|1.0|1.3| 2.8|1.0|0.1|\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nTo give the tables necessary to develop this interesting subject to\r\nits full capacity, would be altogether beyond the scope of my little\r\ntreatise.

To grow this\r\ncrop would cost the farmer who depends on barn manure mainly, about\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n                               DEBTOR.\r\n\r\n  Ploughing twice, harrowing and dragging,                    $9.00\r\n  Seed, 10 lbs.,                                               3.50\r\n  Planting,                                                    1.00\r\n  Sliding, weeding and thinning crop,                         16.00\r\n  Gathering, topping and storing,                             12.00\r\n  Manure, and handling of 7 cords,                            38.00\r\n  Refuse salt, 16 bushels, at $1.25 per hogshead,              2.50\r\n  Interest, taxes and wear and tear of implements and teams,  15.00\r\n                                                             ------\r\n                              Total cost,                    $97.00\r\n\r\n                              CREDITOR.\r\n\r\n  By crop of 22 tons roots, at $8.50 per ton,               $187.00\r\n   “ tops,--4 tons, at $5.00,                                 20.00\r\n   “ value of manure left in soil,                            14.00\r\n                                                            -------\r\n                                                            $221.00\r\n                              Balance,                      $123.00\r\n\r\nIn the above estimate I have assumed most of the labor to be by boys,\r\nwho at hand weeding, if they are reliable, can get over the ground\r\nfaster than men. I have made no allowance for the cost of cutting\r\nup the roots when feeding, as this does not belong under this head.\r\nShould the land be old the item of weeding would have to be increased\r\none-half. The salt I have priced at its cost along the sea-coast. I\r\nhave estimated the value of the crop at the average value of several\r\nyears past, while the manure charge is higher than it should be where\r\nfarmers have access to the fertilizing wastes of great cities.\r\n\r\nNow, if instead of being contented with a crop of 22 tons to the\r\nacre, the farmer strives for double that quantity, he will get it by\r\nadditional expense in but two directions, viz.: his manure bill and\r\nthe cost of gathering and storing. If we now double the cost of each\r\nof the latter, and credit the results with double the crop, which\r\nevery practical farmer who has had experience in root culture will\r\nallow is but reasonable, we shall have the following results:--\r\n\r\n    Extra cost of crop of 44 tons over one of 22:\r\n      Manure,--7 cords,                           $38.00\r\n      Gathering, topping and storing,              12.00\r\n                                                  ------\r\n                                                  $50.00\r\n\r\n    Now adding-the credit side we shall have for\r\n      Extra 22 tons roots,                       $187.00\r\n      Six tons tops,                               30.00\r\n      Value of manure left in ground,              14.00\r\n                                                 -------\r\n                                                 $231.00\r\n                    Deduct extra cost,             50.00\r\n                                                 -------\r\n                    Profits cleared,             $181.00\r\n\r\nIn other words, by investing $68.00 for six months, we clear\r\n$163.00, which, as any farmer boy can figure, is at the rate of\r\nabout five hundred per cent. a year. Mr. Fearing of Hingham, with\r\nthe same amount of manure raised over sixty tons to the acre, and\r\nthe instances are numerous where over forty tons have been the crop\r\nwhen even a less quantity has been used. Can any farmer who has\r\naccumulated a small surplus of money do better than invest it in\r\nmanure? There is altogether too much money, for the prosperity of\r\ntheir farming, invested by farmers in Savings Banks. These banks\r\npay from four per cent. on money, but here is an instance where an\r\ninvestment made in manure pays over four hundred per cent. Merchants\r\ndon’t do so foolish a thing as to put their earnings into Savings\r\nBanks. No; they invest in their business and so keep it and its money\r\nmaking capacity under their own control; when will farmers be as\r\nwise and become their own bankers? Let me remark that the farmer who\r\nis so wise as to attempt to get the most from his land will do well\r\nto follow Prof. Voelcker’s advice and drill in four or five hundred\r\nweight of dissolved bone to the acre, in place of the same value in\r\nstable manure.\r\n\r\nIn the above estimates of the value of Mangolds we have assumed that\r\nthe farmer sold his crop. Now it is true of this as of every other\r\ncrop that the farmer can use on his premises, that it is of more\r\nvalue to him than the general market price indicates.\r\n\r\nUnder this head an intelligent farmer of large experience writes:--\r\n\r\n“From experiments made in feeding beets, their value has been made\r\nto range from 13 to 20 cents per bushel, with hay at twenty dollars\r\nper ton. An exact estimate of the practical value of beets for\r\ncattle food, is a difficult matter, as it is now, and ever will be,\r\nhid from mortal ken. The improved condition of the cow (when fed\r\nto cows during the winter), her increased usefulness during the\r\nentire season, her lessened liability to sickness and disease which\r\nhigh feeding with any one of the different kinds of grain induces,\r\nher lengthened lease of life, her evident satisfaction and perfect\r\ncontentment, which is so plainly manifested while eating her daily\r\nration of roots, are each and every one legitimate items to be taken\r\ninto the account in estimating the practical, the actual value of\r\nbeets as food for dairy stock.\r\n\r\n“After carefully looking at the subject in all its bearings, so far\r\nas my experience has given me opportunity to do so, I have come to\r\nthe conclusion that beets for cattle food are well worth fully as\r\nmany cents per bushel as good hay is worth dollars per ton, without\r\ntaking into consideration the increase of the manure; and that the\r\naverage cost, when stored in the cellar or put into pits, with every\r\nitem of expense included, need not exceed eight cents per bushel.”\r\n\r\nI will close my little treatise by remarking that while I cannot\r\nexpect to have exhausted so prolific a subject, yet I hope and trust\r\nthat it may prove of value as a guide and a stimulus to some of my\r\nmany friends in the great community of farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CABBAGES:\r\n\r\n                          HOW TO RAISE THEM.\r\n\r\n                      Price, 30 Cents, by Mail.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SQUASHES:\r\n\r\n                          HOW TO GROW THEM.\r\n\r\n                      Price, 30 Cents, by Mail.\r\n\r\n           Each of these treatises is amply illustrated and\r\n           gives full particulars on every point, including\r\n                   keeping and marketing the crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ONION RAISING.\r\n\r\n                         WHAT KINDS TO RAISE\r\n\r\n                                 AND\r\n\r\n                        The Way to Raise Them.\r\n\r\nThis work, issued by me in 1865, has been recommended by some of the\r\nbest authorities in the country and has gone through sixteen editions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PRICE BY MAIL, 30 CENTS.\r\n\r\n                         JAMES J.
