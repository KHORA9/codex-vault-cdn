In 1896 I\r\nspent nearly a month at Kimberley, when Mr. Gardner F. Williams,\r\nthe General Manager of the De Beers Consolidated Mines, and the\r\nmanagers of neighbouring mines, did their utmost to aid in my\r\nzealous quest for reliable information. They gave me free access\r\nto all workings above and below ground, allowed me to examine at\r\nleisure their stock and to take extracts from their books. I had\r\nexceptional opportunities of studying the geology of the Diamond\r\nand of noting the strange cataclysmal facts connected with the\r\nbirth, growth, and physics of the lustrous stones.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 with my wife I returned to Kimberley. We were members of\r\nthe British Association which held its meeting that year in South\r\nAfrica. I was asked to give one of the Association lectures at\r\nKimberley and it was natural for me to discourse “On Diamonds.”\r\nDuring our stay we were the guests of Mr. Gardner Williams.\r\n\r\nReturning to England after the visit of 1896, I gave two\r\nlectures on Diamonds at the Imperial Institute and one at the\r\nRoyal Institution. These lectures, and the lecture delivered at\r\nKimberley, in 1905--hitherto only privately distributed--form\r\nthe basis of the present volume. On each visit I took abundant\r\nphotographs, many of which I now reproduce. A few are copied\r\nfrom plans lent by Mr. Gardner Williams and one or two are from\r\nphotographs purchased at Kimberley.\r\n\r\nIn obtaining statistical information of the Diamond industry, I owe\r\nmuch to the Annual Reports of the De Beers Company. I have also\r\nquoted freely from Reunart’s valuable book on _Diamonds and Gold in\r\nSouth Africa_; and I render my acknowledgments to the authors of\r\nthe following papers and memoirs.\r\n\r\n_On a Visit to the Diamond Fields of South Africa, with Notices of\r\nGeological Phenomena by the Wayside._ By John Paterson, Esq., M.A.\r\n\r\n_On the Mode of Occurrence of Diamonds in South Africa._ By E.

I have pictured the\r\nstrenuous toil of the men who bring to the surface the buried\r\ntreasures, and I have given some idea of the skill and ingenuity\r\nwith which their labours are controlled. I have done my best to\r\nexplain the fiery origin of the Diamond, and to describe the\r\nglowing, molten, subterranean furnaces where they first begin\r\nmysteriously to take shape. I have shown that a diamond is the\r\noutcome of a series of Titanic earth convulsions, and that these\r\nprecious gems undergo cycles of fiery, strange, and potent\r\nvicissitudes before they can blaze on a ring or a tiara.\r\n\r\nI am glad to have paid these two visits to South Africa. I always\r\nrecall with interest the dusky smiling natives at work and at\r\nplay. I am glad to have seen that Arabian Nights vision, the\r\nstrong-room of the De Beers Company. Above all, I have vividly\r\ngraven on my heart the friendly welcome, and the innumerable acts\r\nof kindness shown us by our able, energetic, and enterprising\r\nColonial fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\n  W.

It\r\nhas been a perennial puzzle--one of the “riddles of the painful\r\nearth.” It is recorded in _Sprat’s History of the Royal Society_\r\n(1667) that among the questions sent by order of the Society to\r\nSir Philiberto Vernatti, Resident in Batavia, was one inquiring\r\n“Whether Diamonds grow again after three or four years in the same\r\nplaces where they have been digged out?” The answer sent back was,\r\n“Never, or at least as the memory of man can attain to.”\r\n\r\nIn a lecture “On Diamonds,” fifty years ago,[1] Professor Maskelyne\r\nsaid, “The diamond is a substance which transcends all others in\r\ncertain properties to which it is indebted for its usefulness in\r\nthe arts and its beauty as an ornament. Thus, on the one hand, it\r\nis the hardest substance found in nature or fashioned by art. Its\r\nreflecting power and refractive energy, on the other hand, exceed\r\nthose of all other colourless bodies, while it yields to none in\r\nthe perfection of its pellucidity.” He was constrained to add, “The\r\nformation of the diamond is an unsolved problem.”\r\n\r\nDiamonds are found in widely separated parts of the globe. In the\r\nUnited States they have been found in Arkansas, where the work of\r\ntesting the deposits is now going on steadily and quietly. The\r\ngeneral geology and petrography of the area and the weathering of\r\nthe peridotite are described in a paper read before the American\r\nInstitute of Mining Engineers by Messrs. Kunz and Washington. In\r\ntests made with a diamond drill the peridotite was proved to\r\ndepths of 200 feet. The green and yellow grounds underlying the\r\nlayer of black, sticky soil are found to extend down 40 feet in\r\nplaces, and are estimated to average 20 feet in depth over the\r\narea. The outcrop of the peridotite is estimated to cover about\r\n40 acres, and may be larger. Some 540 diamonds have been found,\r\nwith an aggregate of 200 carats. The largest stone weighs about\r\n6·5 carats, though the average size compares favourably with the\r\ngeneral run of most of the South African mines. There is a large\r\nproportion of white stones, many of which are free from flaws and\r\nare very brilliant. The genuineness of the occurrence of diamonds\r\nin their matrix is again proved, one stone having been found\r\nimbedded in the green ground at a depth of 15 feet. This peridotite\r\nhas the form of a volcanic pipe, and therefore its outcrop is\r\nlimited to one place.\r\n\r\nIn California authentic finds of diamonds are recorded in Butte\r\nCounty, especially at Cherokee, above Orville. These diamonds,\r\nhowever, have come from alluvial deposits and have been found\r\ngenerally in washing for gold. As yet no authenticated discovery of\r\ndiamond in its original matrix in California is recorded.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil the diamond industry has been increasing of late years,\r\nand the old mines in the Diamantina country are being worked by\r\nAmerican capital and by the American methods which have proved so\r\nsuccessful at De Beers. It is estimated that the annual value of\r\nthe diamonds exported from Brazil amounts to over £800,000, but\r\nit is impossible to arrive at accurate figures owing to the large\r\nquantities smuggled out of the country to avoid payment of the\r\nexport tax.\r\n\r\nBritish Guiana produces a small quantity of diamonds, mostly,\r\nhowever, of small size. Between January and September, 1907, 1564\r\ncarats were exported.\r\n\r\nIndian diamonds chiefly come from the states of Panna, Charkhari,\r\nand Ajaigarh. In 1905 India exported 3059 carats, valued at £5160.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPE COLONY\r\n\r\nIt is a standing surprise to the watchful outsider how little\r\nattention is bestowed on some of our colonies. For instance, to\r\nthe Cape Colony, comprising vast, varied, and productive regions,\r\nwe have till recently manifested profound ignorance and consequent\r\nindifference. When the Cape Colony was first incorporated with\r\nthe Empire, it was pronounced “a bauble, unworthy of thanks.” Yet\r\nbefore the Suez Canal and the Waghorn overland route to India, the\r\nCape, as commanding our road to India, Australia, and China, had a\r\nspecial importance. Even now it presents an alternative route which\r\nunder conceivable circumstances may be of capital moment.\r\n\r\nThe high grounds above Cape Town are rich in medicinal\r\nhealth-giving waters. The districts where these springs occur\r\nare high-lying, free from malaria, and admirably adapted for the\r\nrestoration of invalids. It needs only some distinguished power to\r\nset the fashion, some emperor, prince, or reigning beauty to take\r\nthe baths and drink the waters, and the tide of tourists would\r\ncarry prosperity to Aliwal North, Fraserburg, Cradock, and Fort\r\nBeaufort.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa, as I shall endeavour to show in detail, is the most\r\nimportant source of diamonds on the earth, and ranks with Australia\r\nand California as one of the three great gold-yielding regions. But\r\nthe wealth of South Africa is not only in its gold and diamonds.\r\nThe province of Natal contains more coal than Britain ever owned\r\nbefore a single bucket had been raised, and the beds extend over\r\nthe Orange River Colony, whilst valuable iron ores exist also in\r\nlarge quantities.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1896 I spent nearly a month at Kimberley. Mr. Gardner\r\nF. Williams, General Manager of the De Beers Consolidated Mines,\r\nand the Managers of neighbouring mines, did their utmost to assist\r\nme in my inquiries and to ply me with valuable information. I had\r\nfull access to all the workings, above and below ground, and was\r\nable to examine at leisure their stock and take extracts from their\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the year 1905, I paid another visit to Kimberley as the\r\nguest of Mr. Gardner Williams on the occasion of the meeting of the\r\nBritish Association in South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVER WASHINGS\r\n\r\nBesides the matrix mines, where the stones are found in pipes\r\nsupposed to be of volcanic origin, the alluvial deposits on the\r\nVaal River are of considerable importance. The terraces and gravels\r\nalong the Vaal River for about 200 miles have been worked for\r\ndiamonds, the deposits sometimes extending several miles on each\r\nside of the river, and varying from a few inches to 40 or 50 feet\r\nin thickness. The diamonds are found almost everywhere through the\r\ngravel deposit.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the present mode of diamond extraction followed\r\nin the important mines, I will commence with these “River\r\nWashings,” where, in their primitive simplicity, can be seen the\r\nmodes of work and the simple machinery long since discarded in\r\nthe large centres of the industry. The drift or so-called “river\r\nwashings” present a very interesting phase of diamond industry. The\r\nwork is carried on in the primitive fashion adopted in the early\r\ndays of diamond discovery, every man working on his own little\r\nclaim, assisted by a few natives, and employing primitive machinery\r\n(Fig. 1). The chief centre of the Vaal River washings is about 30\r\nmiles to the north-west of Kimberley, at a place called Klipdam\r\nNo. 2. There was originally a Klipdam a few miles further, and\r\nhere the miners congregated, but the exhaustion of their claims\r\nmade them migrate to others not far off and reported to be richer.\r\nHere, accordingly, they re-erected their iron houses and called it\r\nKlipdam No. 2.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to speak of “river washings.” The diamantiferous\r\ndeposits are not special to the old or recent river bed, but appear\r\nto be alluvial deposits spread over a large tract of country by\r\nthe agency of water, which at some period of time subsequent to\r\nthe filling up of the volcanic pipes planed off projecting kopjes\r\nfrom the surface of the country and scattered the debris broadcast\r\nover the land to the north-west of Kimberley. The larger diamonds\r\nand other heavy minerals would naturally seek the lowest places,\r\ncorresponding with the river bed, past and present. The fact that\r\nno diamonds are found in the alluvial deposits near Kimberley\r\nmay perhaps be explained by supposing that the first rush was\r\nsufficiently strong to carry the debris past without deposition,\r\nand that deposition occurred when the stream slackened speed. At\r\nKlipdam No. 2 the diamantiferous earth is remarkably like river\r\ngravel, of a strong red colour--quite different from the Kimberley\r\nblue ground--and forms a layer from 1 to 8 feet thick, lying over\r\na “hard pan” of amygdaloidal trap, the melaphyre of the Kimberley\r\nmines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. RIVER WASHINGS AT KLIPDAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. PLAN OF THE KIMBERLEY DIAMOND MINES.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 10.]\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Klipdam the miners had congregated at a spot\r\ncalled “New Rush,” where some good finds of diamonds had been\r\nreported. The gravel is dug and put into a machine resembling\r\nthe gold miner’s dolly, where it is rocked and stirred by rakes,\r\nwith a current of water flowing over it. Here all the fine stuff\r\nis washed away and a rough kind of concentration effected. The\r\nresidual gravel is put on a table and sorted for diamonds--an\r\noperation performed by the master. At one of the claims where\r\nwork was proceeding vigorously I asked the proprietor to let\r\nme be present at the sorting out, as I should like to see river\r\ndiamonds. He willingly consented, but no diamonds were to be found.\r\nOn my expressing regret, he said he had not seen a diamond for a\r\nfortnight! I remarked that the prospect was rather a poor one,\r\nbut he told me that a fortnight before he picked out one worth\r\n£300, “and that,” he said, “will pay for several weeks’ wages of\r\nmy boys.” This is the kind of speculative gambling that goes on at\r\nthe river diggings. The miner may toil fruitlessly for months, and\r\nthen come across a pocket of stones, where they have been swept by\r\nsome eddy, by which he will net several thousands. Diamonds from\r\nthe “river washings” are of all kinds, as if contributed by every\r\nmine in the neighbourhood. They are much rolled and etched, and\r\ncontain a good proportion of first-class stones; they are of very\r\ngood quality, as if only the better and larger stones had survived\r\nthe ordeal of knocking about. Diamonds from the drift fetch about\r\n40 per cent more than those from Kimberley; taking the yield of the\r\nKimberley and De Beers mines as worth all round, large and small,\r\n26s. 6d. a carat, those from the drift are worth 40s.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the better class of natives--the Zulus, Matabeles,\r\nBasutos, and Bechuanas--when well treated, are very honest and\r\nloyal to their masters. An amusing instance of the devotion of a\r\nZulu came to my knowledge at Klipdam. He had been superintending\r\na gang of natives on a small claim at the river washings. It\r\nyielded but few stones, and the owner--my informant--sold the\r\nclaim, handing over the plant and small staff, our friend the\r\nZulu remaining to look after the business till the new owner took\r\npossession. In the course of a few months the purchaser became\r\ndissatisfied with his bargain, not a single diamond having turned\r\nup since the transfer. One night the Zulu came to his old master\r\nin a mysterious manner, and laying a handful of diamonds on the\r\ntable, said, “There, Baas, are your diamonds; I was not going to\r\nlet the new man have any of them!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nKIMBERLEY AND ITS DIAMOND MINES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe famous diamond mines in the neighbourhood are Kimberley, De\r\nBeers, Dutoitspan, Bultfontein, and Wesselton (Fig. 2). They\r\nare situated in latitude 28° 43´ South and longitude 24° 46´\r\nEast. Kimberley is practically in the centre of the present\r\ndiamond-producing area. Besides these mines others of some\r\nimportance of the Orange River Colony are known as Jaggersfontein\r\nand Koffyfontein, Lace, and Monastery, besides two new mines, the\r\nRoberts-Victor and the Voorspoed.\r\n\r\nThe areas of the mines are:\r\n\r\n  Kimberley        33 acres\r\n  De Beers         22 acres\r\n  Dutoitspan       45 acres\r\n  Bultfontein      36 acres\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the total number of carats raised from these mines was more\r\nthan two million and a half, the sales of which realised £6,452,597.\r\n\r\nThe most important mine outside the Kimberley group is the new\r\nPremier Mine, about 20 miles West-North-West of Pretoria, where the\r\nfamous Cullinan diamond was found.\r\n\r\nOther diamond mines are the Frank Smith, Wesselton, the Kamfersdam,\r\nthe Kimberley West, the Newlands, and the Leicester Mine.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the country round Kimberley is covered with a\r\nferruginous red, adhesive, sandy soil, which makes horse traffic\r\nvery heavy. Below the red soil is a basalt, much decomposed and\r\nhighly ferruginous, from 20 to 90 feet thick, and lower still\r\nfrom 200 to 250 feet of black slaty shale containing carbon and\r\niron pyrites. These are known as the Kimberley shales; they are\r\nvery combustible, and in a part of the De Beers Mine where they\r\nwere accidentally fired they smouldered for over eighteen months.\r\nThen follows a bed of conglomerate about 10 feet thick, and below\r\nthe conglomerate about 400 feet of a hard, compact rock of an\r\nolive colour, called “Melaphyre,” or olivine diabase. Below the\r\nmelaphyre is a hard quartzite about 400 feet thick. The strata\r\nare almost horizontal, dipping slightly to the north; in places\r\nthey are distorted and broken through by protruding dykes of trap.\r\nThere is no water nearer than the Vaal River, about 14 miles away,\r\nand formerly the miners were dependent on rain-water and a few\r\nsprings and pools. Now, however, a constant and abundant supply of\r\nexcellent water is served to the town, whilst good brick houses,\r\nwith gardens and orchards, spring up on all sides. To mark the\r\nrate of progress, Kimberley has an excellent club and one of\r\nthe best public libraries in South Africa. Parts of the town,\r\naffectionately called “the camp” by the older inhabitants, are not\r\nbeyond the galvanised iron stage, and the general appearance is\r\nunlovely and depressing. Reunert reckons that over a million trees\r\nhave been cut down to supply timber for the mines, and the whole\r\ncountry within a radius of 100 miles has been denuded of wood with\r\nthe most injurious effects on the climate. The extreme dryness of\r\nthe air, and the absence of trees to break the force of the wind\r\nand temper the heat of the sun, probably account for the dust\r\nstorms so frequent in summer. The temperature in the day frequently\r\nrises to 100° in the shade, but in so dry a climate this is not\r\nunpleasant, and I felt less oppressed by this heat than I did in\r\nLondon the previous September. Moreover, in Kimberley, owing to the\r\nhigh altitude, the nights are always cool.\r\n\r\nThe approach to Kimberley is deadly dull. The country is almost\r\ntreeless, and the bare veldt stretches its level length, relieved\r\nonly by distant hills on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PIPES OR CRATERS\r\n\r\nThe five diamond mines or craters are all contained in a circle 3½\r\nmiles in diameter. They are irregularly shaped round or oval pipes,\r\nextending vertically downwards to an unknown depth, retaining about\r\nthe same diameter throughout (Fig. 3). They are said to be volcanic\r\nnecks, filled from below with a heterogeneous mixture of fragments\r\nof the surrounding rocks, and of older rocks such as granite,\r\nmingled and cemented with a bluish-coloured, hard clayey mass, in\r\nwhich famous blue clay the imbedded diamonds are hidden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. KIMBERLEY MINE. THE “PIPE.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. SECTION OF KIMBERLEY MINE.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 18.]\r\n\r\nThe craters or mines are situate in depressions, which have no\r\noutlets for the water which falls upon the neighbouring hills. The\r\nwatersheds of these hills drain into ponds, called pans or vleis.\r\nThe water, which accumulates in these ponds during the rainy\r\nseason, evaporates during the dry months, only one of them holding\r\nwater throughout the dry season. The rocks which surround the\r\ncraters are capped by red soil or calcareous tufa, and in places by\r\nboth, the red soil covering the tufa.\r\n\r\nThe diamantiferous breccia filling the mines, usually called “blue\r\nground,” is a collection of fragments of shale, various eruptive\r\nrocks, boulders, and crystals of many kinds of minerals. Indeed,\r\na more heterogeneous mixture can hardly be found anywhere else\r\non this globe. The ground mass is of a bluish green, soapy to\r\nthe touch and friable, especially after exposure to the weather.\r\nProfessor Maskelyne considers it to be a hydrated bronzite with a\r\nlittle serpentine.\r\n\r\nThe Kimberley mine is filled for the first 70 or 80 feet with what\r\nis called “yellow ground,” and below that with “blue ground” (Fig.\r\n4). This superposed yellow on blue is common to all the mines.\r\nThe blue is the unaltered ground, and owes its colour chiefly to\r\nthe presence of lower oxides of iron. When atmospheric influences\r\nhave access to the iron it is peroxidised and the ground assumes\r\na yellow colour. The thickness of yellow earth in the mines\r\nis therefore a measure of the depth of penetration of air and\r\nmoisture. The colour does not affect the yield of diamonds.\r\n\r\nBesides diamonds, there have been detected more than eighty species\r\nof minerals in the blue ground, the more common being magnetite,\r\nilmenite, garnet, bright green ferriferous enstatite (bronzite),\r\na hornblendic mineral closely resembling smaragdite, calc-spar,\r\nvermiculite, diallage, jeffreysite, mica, kyanite, augite, peridot,\r\neclogite, iron pyrites, wollastonite, vaalite, zircon, chrome\r\niron, rutile, corundum, apatite, olivine, sahlite, chromite,\r\npseudobrookite, perofskite, biotite, and quartz. The blue ground\r\ndoes not show any signs of passing through great heat, as the\r\nfragments in the breccia are not fused at the edges. The eruptive\r\nforce was probably steam or water-gas, acting under great pressure,\r\nbut at no high temperature. According to Mr. Dunn, in the Kimberley\r\nMine, at a depth of 120 feet, several small fresh-water shells were\r\ndiscovered in what appeared to be undisturbed material.\r\n\r\nA selection of thin sections of some of these rocks and minerals,\r\nmounted as microscopic objects and viewed by polarised light, are\r\nnot only of interest to the geologist, but are objects of great\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of shale and fragments of other rocks testify that\r\nthe _mélange_ has suffered no great heat in its present condition,\r\nand that it has been erupted from great depths by the agency of\r\nwater vapour or some similar gas.\r\n\r\nThe rock outside the pipes and encasing them is called “reef.”\r\nInside some of the mines occur large masses of “floating reef,”\r\ncovering an area of several thousand square feet. In the De Beers\r\nMine is what is called “the snake,” a dyke of igneous rock taking a\r\nserpentine course across the mine, and standing like a vein nearly\r\nvertical, varying in thickness from 2 to 7 feet. The main body of\r\nthe blue ground is entirely analogous to the snake rock, naturally\r\nmore decomposed, but in essential points the microscopic appearance\r\nof the blue ground and of the “snake” is in an extraordinary degree\r\nalike. Mr. Gardner Williams supposes that the “snake” is a younger\r\neruptive formation coming from the same volcanic source as the blue\r\nground. No diamonds have been found either in the “snake” or the\r\nfloating reef. The ground, however, is generally richer in diamonds\r\nin the neighbourhood of the floating reef.\r\n\r\nBefore the discovery of the mines there was nothing in the\r\nsuperficial appearance of the ground to indicate the treasures\r\nbelow. Since the volcanic ducts were filled with the\r\ndiamantiferous ground, denudation has planed the surface and the\r\nupper parts of the craters, and other ordinary signs of volcanic\r\nactivity being smoothed away, the superficial and ubiquitous red\r\nsand covered the whole surface. The Kimberley Mine seems to have\r\npresented a slight elevation above the surrounding flat country,\r\nwhile the sites of other mines were level or even slightly\r\ndepressed. The Wesselton Mine, within a mile of Dutoitspan, has\r\nonly been discovered a few years. It showed a slight depression\r\non the surface, which had been used as a shoot for dry rubbish.\r\nThere are other diamantiferous pipes in the neighbourhood, but they\r\nare small and do not contain stones in payable quantities. More\r\nrecently another diamantiferous pipe has been discovered about\r\n40 miles off, near Klipdam, and is now worked as the Leicester\r\nMine. Other hoards of diamonds may also be near; where there are\r\nno surface signs, and the pipe itself is hidden under 10 or 20\r\nfeet of recent deposits, it is impossible to prospect the entire\r\ncountry. Accident has hitherto been the chief factor in the\r\ndiscovery of diamond mines.\r\n\r\nHow the great pipes were originally formed is hard to say. They\r\nwere certainly not burst through in the ordinary manner of volcanic\r\neruption, since the surrounding and enclosing walls show no signs\r\nof igneous action, and are not shattered or broken up even when\r\ntouching the “blue ground.” It is pretty certain these pipes were\r\nfilled from below after they were pierced and the diamonds were\r\nformed at some previous time and mixed with a mud volcano, together\r\nwith all kinds of debris eroded from the rocks through which it\r\nerupted. The direction of flow is seen in the upturned edges of\r\nsome of the strata of shale in the walls, although I was unable to\r\nsee any upturning in most parts of the walls of the De Beers Mine\r\nat great depths.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KIMBERLEY MINE IN OLD DAYS\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Paterson, who examined the diamond fields of\r\nKimberley soon after their discovery, “Wherever the diamond is\r\nobtained perfect in form and smooth in finest smoothness of\r\nsurface, without depression, hump, or twist of any kind, such\r\ndiamonds were ever found in their own little moulds of finest\r\nlimey stuff,[2] and as if such mould of lime had been a necessity\r\nto their perfect formation. And further, where the splinters of\r\ndiamonds, or boarty stuff, were chiefly met by the diggers, there\r\nwas much less presence of limey matter in the claim at the section\r\nof it where such broken or fragmentary diamonds were found; and\r\nthat chiefly from among what the diggers termed ‘clay-ballast,’ or\r\n‘burnt brick,’ were unearthed the bits or undeveloped crystals so\r\nplentiful at New Rush.”[3]\r\n\r\nIn the first days of diamond mining there was no idea that\r\ndiamantiferous earth extended to any particular depth, and miners\r\nwere allowed to dig holes at haphazard and prospect where they\r\nliked. When the Kimberley Mine was discovered a new arrangement was\r\nmade, and in July, 1871, it was cut up into about 500 claims, each\r\n31 feet square, with spaces reserved for about fifteen roadways\r\nacross the mine. No person at first could hold more than two\r\nclaims--a rule afterwards modified.\r\n\r\nThe following quotation from a description of a visit to Kimberley\r\nin 1872, by Mr. Paterson, taken from a paper read by him to the\r\nGeologists’ Association, gives a graphic picture of the early days\r\nof the Kimberley Mine:\r\n\r\n“The New Rush diggings (as the Kimberley Mine was at first called)\r\nare all going forward in an oval space enclosed around by the trap\r\ndyke, and of which the larger diameter is about 1000 feet, while\r\nthe shorter is not more than 700 feet in length. Here all the\r\nclaims of 31 feet square each are marked out with roadways of about\r\n12 feet in width, occurring every 60 feet. Upon these roadways, by\r\nthe side of a short pole fixed into the roadway, sits the owner of\r\nthe claim with watchful eye upon the Kafir diggers below, who fill\r\nand hoist, by means of a pulley fixed to the pole above, bucketful\r\nafter bucketful of the picked marl stuff in which the diamonds are\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n“Many of the claims are already sunk to a depth of 100 feet,\r\nand still the diamonds continue to be found as plentifully as\r\never. From the roadway above the marl is carted away to the\r\nsorting-tables, outside the range of the diggings, among mounds of\r\nmarl stuff which seem like little hills. Here, amidst such whirls\r\nof dust as are nowhere else seen, the marl stuff is pounded, sifted\r\nfrom the finest powder of lime and clay, and from the residue put\r\non the sorting-tables, the diggers, with a piece of zinc 9 inches\r\nlong by 4 inches in breadth, search out in the successive layers\r\ntaken from the heap the precious gems. I need not tell you that\r\nthe search is by no means very perfect, or that perhaps as many\r\ndiamonds escape the digger’s eye as are discovered and taken out\r\nby him, but you will perhaps confess with me that their aptness\r\nin picking out the diamonds is by no means to be despised, when I\r\ntell you that in one six months from the date of opening New Rush\r\ndiggings, little short of a million sterling in diamonds has been\r\nextracted from them. At close of day the diggers take daily stock\r\nof their finds, and between five and six o’clock in the afternoon\r\nare to be seen hundreds and hundreds moving through the main street\r\nof New Rush on visits to the tents of the buyers, seated behind\r\ntheir little green baize tables, with scales all ready, and bags of\r\ngold and silver and piles of banknotes, to buy the little gems.”\r\n\r\nIt may help to realise the enormous value of the Kimberley Mine if\r\nI say that two claims, measuring together 62 by 31 feet and worked\r\nto a depth of 150 feet, yielded 28,000 carats of diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe roadways across the mine soon, however, became unsafe.\r\nClaims were sunk 100 or 200 feet each side of a roadway, and the\r\ntemptation to undermine roadways was not always resisted. Falls of\r\nroad frequently took place, followed by complete collapse, burying\r\nmine and claims in ruin. At that time there were probably 12,000 or\r\n15,000 men at work in the mine, and then came the difficulty how to\r\ncontinue working the host of separate claims without interference\r\nwith each other. A system of rope haulage was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe following description of the work at the Kimberley Mine at this\r\nstage of its history is given by Mr. Reunert:[4]\r\n\r\n“A succession of tall, massive timber stagings was erected round\r\nthe margin of the mine. Each staging carried two or three platforms\r\none above the other, every platform serving as an independent level\r\nfrom which to communicate with the claims below. Stationary ropes\r\nwere then stretched from the different levels of the stagings to\r\nthe claims, the ropes being anchored to the ground at both ends:\r\nthe upper platforms communicated with the claims in the centre of\r\nthe mine, the lower platforms with those nearer the margin. The\r\nhauling ropes were attached to windlasses worked by Kafirs on the\r\nseveral platforms, on which grooved guide wheels for the ropes were\r\nalso fixed, the buckets being swung from the stationary ropes by\r\nlittle overhead runners and crooks. Arrived at the level of the\r\nplatform the bucket was tipped into a narrow shoot, down which the\r\nground ran into a bag held ready to receive it, in which it was\r\nconveyed away to be sorted. The din and rattle of these thousands\r\nof wheels and the twang of the buckets along the ropes were\r\nsomething deafening, while the mine itself seemed almost darkened\r\nby the thick cobweb of ropes, so numerous as to appear almost\r\ntouching. This mode of haulage continued in vogue during the whole\r\nof 1873, and if the appearance of the mine was less picturesque\r\nthan when the roadways existed, it was, if anything, more unique.\r\nBy moonlight, particularly, it was a weird and beautiful sight.”\r\n\r\nThe mine was now threatened in two other quarters. The removal of\r\nthe blue ground took away the support from the walls of the pipe,\r\nand frequent falls of reef occurred, not only covering up valuable\r\nclaims with rubbish, but endangering the lives of workers below.\r\nMoreover, as the workings deepened, water made its appearance,\r\nnecessitating pumping. In 1878 one quarter of the claims were\r\ncovered by reef, and in 1879 over £300,000 were spent on removing\r\nreef and water. In 1881 over £200,000 were thus spent, and in 1882\r\nmore than half a million sterling was needed to defray the cost of\r\nreef removal. So matters went on until four million cubic yards\r\nof reef had been removed, at a cost of two millions sterling, and\r\nstill little good was done, for out of 400 claims in the mine only\r\nabout fifty could be regularly worked. Ultimately, in November,\r\n1883, the biggest fall of reef on record took place, estimated at\r\n250,000 cubic yards, surging half across the mine, where the bulk\r\nof it lies to this day. It became evident that open workings could\r\nnot be carried on at such depths, and after many experiments the\r\npresent system of underground working was devised.\r\n\r\nDuring this time of perplexity, individual miners who could easily\r\nhave worked one or two claims near the surface could not continue\r\nwork in the face of harassing difficulties and heavy expenses.\r\nThus the claims gradually changed hands until the mine became the\r\nproperty first of a comparatively small number of capitalists, then\r\nof a smaller number of limited liability companies, until finally\r\nthe whole of the mines have practically become the property of the\r\n“De Beers Consolidated Mines, Limited.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nKIMBERLEY MINES AT THE PRESENT DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe De Beers Consolidated Mines, Limited, was founded in 1888,\r\nmainly through the genius of the late Cecil John Rhodes, for the\r\npurpose of acquiring all-important diamond-mining interests in the\r\nKimberley area and thereby controlling the output. The two richest\r\nmines, Kimberley and De Beers, have been actively worked ever\r\nsince, and have been the main contributors to an output which now\r\nrealises over five millions sterling annually. Dutoitspan Mine was\r\ncompletely closed down, and practically the whole of Bultfontein\r\nwas kept idle for many years; but with a view to the requirements\r\nof the future and the marked increase in the demand for diamonds,\r\nnotwithstanding the steady rise in prices that has taken place,\r\nboth these mines have now been equipped for underground working\r\non a grand scale. The youngest of the De Beers group of mines is\r\nthe Wesselton, which was discovered in 1890 by the late Mr. H. A.\r\nWard, and soon afterwards purchased by Mr. Rhodes on behalf of the\r\nCompany. The mine is now being worked opencast on a magnificent\r\nscale and has largely exceeded original expectations (Fig. 5). The\r\nsuccess of the consolidation is proved by the fact that since it\r\nwas brought about £22,000,000 have been paid in dividends to the\r\nshareholders, and it is roughly estimated that 40,000,000 carats of\r\ndiamonds have been produced of a total value of eighty millions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. WESSELTON DIAMOND MINE. OPEN WORKINGS.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 34.]\r\n\r\nAt the four mines about 8000 persons are daily employed, namely,\r\n1500 whites and 6500 blacks. The wages are, whites, £5 or £6 a\r\nweek; blacks, underground, 4s. to 5s. a day, and aboveground, 21s.\r\na week.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOUND SYSTEM\r\n\r\nWith gems like diamonds, where so large an intrinsic value is\r\nconcentrated into so small a bulk, it is not surprising that\r\nrobbery has to be guarded against in the most elaborate manner. The\r\nIllicit Diamond Buying (I.D.B.) laws are very stringent, and the\r\nsearching, rendered easy by the “compounding” of the natives--which\r\nI shall describe presently--is of the most drastic character (Fig.\r\n6). It is, in fact, very difficult for a native employee to steal\r\ndiamonds; even were he to succeed, it would be almost impossible to\r\ndispose of them, as a potential buyer would prefer to secure the\r\nsafe reward for detecting a theft rather than run the serious risk\r\nof doing convict work on the Cape Town Breakwater for a couple of\r\nyears. I heard of a native who, secreting a diamond worth several\r\nhundreds of pounds, after trying unsuccessfully to sell it, handed\r\nit back to the manager of his compound, glad to get the sixpence a\r\ncarat to which he was entitled. Before the passing of the “Diamond\r\nTrade Act” the value of diamonds stolen reached nearly one million\r\nsterling per annum.\r\n\r\nA “compound” is a large enclosure about 20 acres in extent,\r\nsurrounded by rows of one-story buildings of corrugated iron.\r\nThese are divided into rooms holding each about twenty natives. A\r\nhigh iron fence is erected around the compound, 10 feet from the\r\nbuildings. Within the enclosure is a store where the necessaries\r\nof life are supplied to the natives at a reduced price, wood and\r\nwater being provided free of charge. In the middle is a large\r\nswimming-bath, with fresh water running through it. The rest of\r\nthe space is devoted to recreation, games, dances, concerts, and\r\nany other amusement the native mind can desire. I have to thank\r\nthe superintendents of the respective compounds, who spoke all\r\nthe native dialects, for their kindness in showing us round, and\r\nsuggesting dances and concerts, got up at ten minutes’ notice, for\r\nthe benefit of my camera. The dancing was more of the character\r\nof attitudinising and marching to a monotonous tum-tum, the\r\n“orchestra” consisting of various-sized drums and what they call\r\na piano--an octave or so of tuned slabs of wood held in order on\r\nstretched strings and struck with a wooden hammer. The native music\r\nas a rule is only marking time, but I have heard musical melodies\r\naccompanying some of their songs. In case of accident or illness\r\nthere is a well-appointed hospital where the sick are tended.\r\nMedical supervision, nurses, and food are supplied free by the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nIn the compound are to be seen representatives of nearly all the\r\npicked types of African tribes. Each tribe keeps to itself, and\r\nto go round the buildings skirting the compound is an admirable\r\nobject-lesson in ethnology. At one point is a group of Zulus; next\r\nwe come to Fingoes; then Basutos; beyond come Matabele, Bechuanas,\r\nPondos, Shangains, Swazis, and other less-known tribes, either\r\ngrouped or wandering around making friendly calls.\r\n\r\nThe clothing in the compound is diverse and original. Some of the\r\nmen are evident dandies, whilst others think that in so hot a\r\nclimate a bright-coloured handkerchief or “a pair of spectacles\r\nand a smile” is as great a compliance with the conventions of\r\ncivilisation as can be expected.\r\n\r\nThe natives are not interfered with in their various amusements,\r\nalways provided they do not make themselves objectionable to their\r\nneighbours. They soon learn that tribal animosities are to be left\r\noutside the compound. One Sunday afternoon my wife and I walked\r\nunattended about the compound, almost the only whites present among\r\n1700 natives. The manners of the fold were so friendly, and their\r\nsmiles so cordial, that the idea of fear vanished. At one part a\r\nKafir was making a pair of trousers with a bright nickel-plated\r\nsewing-machine, in which he had invested his savings; next to him\r\na “boy” was reading from the Testament in his own language to an\r\nattentive audience; in a corner a party were engaged in cooking a\r\nsavoury mess in an iron pot; further on the orchestra was tuning\r\nup and Zulus were putting the finishing touches to their toilet of\r\nfeathers and beads. One group was intently watching a mysterious\r\ngame. It is played by two sides, with stones and grooves and\r\nhollows in the ground, and appears of most absorbing interest. It\r\nseems to be universal throughout Africa; it is met with among the\r\nruins of Zimbabwe, and signs of it are recorded on old Egyptian\r\nmonuments. I wanted to learn it, and an intelligent Zulu player\r\noffered to teach it to me in a few minutes. Captain Dallas,\r\nhowever, with a more accurate opinion of my intelligence than my\r\nfriend the Zulu, assured me it would take months before I could\r\nbegin to know anything about it. He had tried for years and could\r\nmake nothing of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. DE BEERS COMPOUND.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. DE BEERS MINE. UNDERGROUND WORKINGS.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 40.]\r\n\r\nThey get good wages, varying according to occupation. The work\r\nis appreciated, and there are always more applicants than can be\r\naccepted. On entering, the restrictions to which they must submit\r\nare fully explained, and they are required to sign for three months\r\nat least, during which time they must not leave the compound or\r\nmine. A covered way and tunnel lead the workers underground to the\r\ndown shaft, while those working on the depositing floors go and\r\ncome under guard. It is seldom that a man does not return once he\r\nhas lived the life in the compound; some come again and again for\r\nyears, only leaving occasionally to spend accumulated savings.\r\nThe most careful men save money, and carry it at intervals to the\r\nsuperintendent to keep for them. Occasionally they ask to look\r\nat their savings, which may amount to £30 or £40, accumulated\r\nby driblets. They are ignorant of savings banks or interest, and\r\nare content if they see their own money in the original rags and\r\npapers. The Kafir, on demand, must behold his coins just as he\r\nhanded them in, wrappings and all. Sometimes the superintendent\r\nwill have as much as £1000 of savings in his care.\r\n\r\nOn leaving, the men generally draw all their savings, and it is not\r\nuncommon for a grateful Kafir to press £2 or £3 on Captain Dallas\r\nin recognition of his trouble. They are astonished when their\r\nofferings are declined; still more so when it is explained that if\r\nthey would put their savings in a bank they would have a few extra\r\npounds given to them for the privilege of taking care of it.\r\n\r\nA shrewd young Pondo, who had been coming year after year, applied\r\nfor some of his savings, and gave as a reason that he wanted to buy\r\na wife. “But you said the same thing last year,” replied Captain\r\nDallas; “I hope nothing has happened.” “No,” said the man; “one\r\nwife, she quarrel with me; two wives, they quarrel with each other;\r\nme peace!”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDERGROUND WORKINGS\r\n\r\nIn the face of constant developments I can only describe the system\r\nin use at the time of my own visits in 1896 and 1905. Shafts are\r\nsunk in the solid rock at a sufficient distance from the pipe to\r\nbe safe against reef movements in the open mine. In 1903 the rock\r\nshafts in the De Beers and Kimberley Mines reached depths of 2076\r\nand 2599 feet respectively. Tunnels are driven from these shafts\r\nat different levels, about 120 feet apart, to cross the mine from\r\nwest to east. These tunnels are connected by two other tunnels\r\nrunning north and south, one near the west side of the mine and one\r\nmidway between it and the east margin of the mine. From the east\r\nand west tunnels offsets are driven to the surrounding rock. When\r\nnear the rock the offsets widen into galleries, these in turn being\r\nstoped on the sides until they meet, and upwards until they break\r\nthrough the blue ground. The fallen reef with which the upper part\r\nof the mine is filled sinks and partially fills the open space. The\r\nworkmen then stand on the fallen reef and drill the blue ground\r\noverhead, and as the roof is blasted back the debris follows. When\r\nstoping between two tunnels the blue is stoped up to the debris\r\nabout midway between the two tunnels. The upper levels are worked\r\nback in advance of the lower levels, and the works assume the\r\nshape of irregular terraces. The main levels are from 90 to 120\r\nfeet apart, with intermediate levels every 30 feet. Hoisting is\r\ndone from only one level at a time through the same shaft. By this\r\ningenious method every portion of blue ground is excavated and\r\nraised to the surface, the rubbish on the top gradually sinking and\r\ntaking its place.\r\n\r\nThe scene below ground in the labyrinth of galleries is bewildering\r\nin its complexity, and very unlike the popular notion of a diamond\r\nmine (Fig. 7). All below is dirt, mud, grime; half-naked men, dark\r\nas mahogany, lithe as athletes, dripping with perspiration, are\r\nseen in every direction, hammering, picking, shovelling, wheeling\r\nthe trucks to and fro, keeping up a weird chant which rises in\r\nforce and rhythm when a greater task calls for excessive muscular\r\nstrain. The whole scene is more suggestive of a coal mine than a\r\ndiamond mine, and all this mighty organisation, this strenuous\r\nexpenditure of energy, this costly machinery, this ceaseless toil\r\nof skilled and black labour, goes on day and night, just to win a\r\nfew stones wherewith to deck my lady’s finger! All to gratify the\r\nvanity of woman! “And,” interposed a lady who heard this remark,\r\n“the depravity of man!”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPOSITING FLOORS\r\n\r\nOwing to the refractory character of blue ground fresh from the\r\nmines, it has to be exposed to atmospheric influences before it\r\nwill pulverise under the action of water and mechanical treatment.\r\n\r\nFrom the surface-boxes, into which the blue ground is tipped\r\nwhen it reaches the top of the main shaft, it is transferred to\r\nside-tipping trucks and sent to the depositing floors by means of\r\nendless wire-rope haulage. The speed of the haulage varies from 2½\r\nto 4 miles per hour. The trucks are counted automatically as they\r\nare sent to the floor by a reciprocating engine-counter placed on\r\na frame near the tramline.\r\n\r\nThe depositing floors are prepared by removing the bush and\r\ngrass from a fairly level piece of ground; this ground is then\r\nrolled smooth and hard. The floors extend over many square miles\r\nof country and are surrounded by 7-foot barbed wire fences,\r\nvigilantly guarded day and night. The De Beers floors, on\r\nKenilworth, are laid off in rectangular sections 600 yards long and\r\n200 yards wide, each section holding about 50,000 loads. The ground\r\nfrom the Kimberley Mine is the softest and only needs a few months’\r\nexposure on the floors; the ground from De Beers is much harder and\r\nrequires at least six months’ exposure, while some ground is so\r\nhard that it will not disintegrate by exposure to the weather under\r\none or two years. The De Beers Mine contains a much larger quantity\r\nof this hard blue ground than the other mines, and in order to save\r\nthe loss of time consequent on keeping an enormous stock of blue\r\nconstantly on the floors, it has recently been decided to pass\r\nthe harder and more refractory stuff direct from the mine through\r\ncrushing mills.\r\n\r\nFor a time the blue ground remains on the floors without undergoing\r\nmuch alteration. But soon the heat of the sun and moisture produce\r\na wonderful effect. Large pieces, hard as ordinary sandstone when\r\ntaken from the mine, commence to crumble. At this stage the winning\r\nof the diamonds assumes more the nature of farming than mining.\r\nThe ground is frequently harrowed and occasionally watered, to\r\nassist pulverisation by exposing the larger pieces to atmospheric\r\ninfluences. The length of time necessary for the ground to weather\r\nbefore it becomes sufficiently pulverised for washing depends on\r\nthe season of the year and the amount of rain. The longer the\r\nground remains exposed the better it is for washing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. DE BEERS WASHING AND CONCENTRATING MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 48.]\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note that there is a marked difference in the\r\nrapidity of disintegration of the blue ground in each of the four\r\nmines. The longer the exposure, the more complete the pulverisation\r\nand the better for washing. Under normal conditions soft blue\r\nground becomes sufficiently pulverised in from four to six\r\nmonths, but it is better to expose it for a longer period, even for\r\na whole year.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHING AND CONCENTRATING MACHINERY\r\n\r\nAfter the blue ground has been weathered for a sufficient time, it\r\nis again loaded into trucks and hauled to the crushing machinery\r\n(Fig. 8). The first or “comet” crushers reduce the ground so that\r\nit will pass into hoppers and thence into revolving cylinders\r\ncovered with perforated steel plates, having holes 1¼ inches in\r\ndiameter which separate the finely crushed from the coarse pieces.\r\n\r\nPieces larger than 1¼ inches pass out of the end of the cylinders\r\nand fall upon a conveyor belt, which takes them to the end of the\r\nmachine--these pieces are mostly waste rock which is found in the\r\nblue ground.\r\n\r\nThe fine ground which passes through the holes in the cylinder,\r\ntogether with a plentiful current of water, flows into the washing\r\npans. These pans are of iron, 14 feet in diameter, furnished with\r\nten arms each having six or seven teeth. The teeth are so set as\r\nto form a spiral, so that when the arms revolve the teeth carry\r\nthe heavy deposit to the outer rim of the pan, while the lighter\r\nmaterial passes towards the centre and is carried from the pan\r\nby the flow of water. The heavy deposit contains the diamonds.\r\nIt remains on the bottom of the pan and near its outer rim. This\r\ndeposit is drawn off every twelve hours by means of a broad slot\r\nin the bottom of the pan. The average quantity of blue ground\r\npassed through each pan is from 400 to 450 loads in ten hours. The\r\ndeposit left in each pan after putting the above number of loads\r\nthrough amounts to three or four loads, which go to the pulsator\r\nfor further concentration.\r\n\r\nAbout 14 per cent of all the ground sent to the depositing floors\r\nis too hard to weather, so of late years crushing and concentrating\r\nplant has been erected to deal effectually with the hard lumps,\r\nthus saving the great lock-up of capital consequent on letting them\r\nlie on the floor a year or two.\r\n\r\nThe hard lumps being hauled to the upper part of the machine,\r\nare tipped into bins, whence they pass to crushing rollers which\r\nso reduce them that they will pass through a ring two inches in\r\ndiameter. The coarse powder is screened through revolving cylinders\r\nhaving ½-inch and 1¼-inch perforations. The stuff passing through\r\nthe finer holes goes to the finishing mill, while the coarser stuff\r\ngoes to smaller crushers. Before the coarse lumps are re-crushed\r\nthey pass over revolving picking tables, where any specially large\r\ndiamonds are rescued, thus preventing the risk of breakage. From\r\nthe picking tables the ground is scraped automatically into two\r\nsets of rolls, and the pulverised product screened again and graded\r\ninto three sizes. The finest size, passing a ½-inch screen, goes\r\nto the washing pans, and the two coarser sizes to jigs. Large\r\ndiamonds which have been separated from their envelope of blue are\r\nretained in the jig. The ground still holding the smaller diamonds\r\npasses out of the end of the jig and then through a series of\r\nrolls, screens, and jigs until the diamantiferous gravel is drawn\r\nfrom the bottom jigs into locked trucks running on tramways to the\r\npulsator for further concentration and sorting.\r\n\r\nThe pulsator is an ingeniously designed but somewhat complicated\r\nmachine for dealing with the diamantiferous gravel already reduced\r\none hundred times from the blue ground, the pulsator still further\r\nconcentrating it till the gravel is rich enough to enable the\r\nstones to be picked out by hand. The value of the diamonds in a\r\nload of original blue ground being about 30s., the gravel sent\r\nto the pulsator from the pans, reduced a hundredfold, is worth\r\n£150 a load. Stuff of this value must not be exposed to risk of\r\npeculation.\r\n\r\nThe locked trucks are hoisted by a cage to a platform, where they\r\nare unlocked and their contents fed into a shoot leading to a\r\ncylinder covered with steel sieving with holes from 1/16 to ⅝ of an\r\ninch in diameter. The five sizes which pass through the cylinder\r\nflow upon a combination of jigs, termed at the mines the pulsators.\r\nThe bottoms of the jigs are covered with screens, or sieving, the\r\nmeshes of which are a little larger than the holes in the revolving\r\ncylinder immediately at the back of them.\r\n\r\nOver each screen is spread a layer of bullets to prevent the\r\nrich deposit from passing too rapidly through the screens. The\r\njigs themselves are stationary, but from below an intermittent\r\nstream of water passes in rapid pulsations with an up and down\r\nmovement. This pulsation keeps the diamantiferous gravel constantly\r\nmoving--“alive” is the expressive word used--and tends to sort out\r\nthe constituents roughly according to their specific gravity, the\r\nheavier particles working to the bottom and the lighter material\r\nwashing off by the flow of water and passing into trucks, whence\r\nit is carried to the tailings heap. The heavier portions, by the\r\nup and down wash of the water, gradually work their way under the\r\nbullets and pass through the screens into pointed boxes, whence\r\nthe heavy concentrates are drawn off upon endless belts. These\r\nconvey their precious load to small elevators by means of which the\r\nconcentrates are lifted into hoppers from which they are fed upon\r\nshaking tables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. SORTING CONCENTRATES FOR DIAMONDS. DE BEERS.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 54.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING THE GEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sorting room in the pulsator house is long, narrow, and\r\nwell lighted (Fig. 9). Here the rich gravel is brought in wet,\r\na sieveful at a time, and is dumped in a heap on tables covered\r\nwith iron plates. The tables at one end take the coarsest lumps,\r\nnext comes the gravel which passed the ⅜-inch holes, then the\r\nnext in order, and so on. The first sorting is done by thoroughly\r\ntrustworthy white men; for here the danger of robbery is greatest.\r\nSweeping the heap of gravel to the right, the sorter scrapes a\r\nlittle of it to the centre of the table by means of a flat piece of\r\nsheet zinc. With this tool he rapidly passes in review the grains,\r\nseizes the diamonds and puts them into a little tin box in front\r\nof him. The stuff is then swept off to the left and another lot\r\ntaken, and so on till the sieveful of gravel is exhausted, when\r\nanother is brought in. The stuff the sorter has passed to his left\r\nas temporarily inspected is taken next to another part of the room,\r\nwhere it is again scrutinised by native convicts again and again,\r\nand whilst diamonds can be found in quantity sufficient to repay\r\nthe cost of convict labour, it is passed under examination.\r\n\r\nThe diamond has a peculiar lustre, and on the sorter’s table it is\r\nimpossible to mistake it for any other stone that may be present.\r\nIt looks somewhat like clear pieces of gum arabic, with a sort of\r\nintrinsic lustre which makes a conspicuous shine among the other\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC DIAMOND COLLECTOR\r\n\r\nA series of experiments was initiated by Mr. Gardner Williams with\r\nthe object of separating the diamonds from the heavy, valueless\r\nconcentrates with which they are associated. An ordinary shaking\r\nor percussion table was constructed, and every known means of\r\nseparation was tried without success. One of the employees of De\r\nBeers, Mr. Fred Kirsten, was in charge of the experimenting, under\r\nthe supervision of the late Mr. George Labram, the manager of the\r\nlarge crushing plant, and afterwards mechanical engineer to the\r\nCompany. Notwithstanding the fact that the specific gravity of\r\nthe diamond (3·52) was less than that of several of the minerals\r\nassociated with it, so that its separation would seem a simple\r\nmatter, it was found in practice to be impossible owing to the\r\nslippery nature of the diamond. The heavy concentrates carried\r\ndiamonds, and diamonds flowed away from the percussion table with\r\nthe tailings. When it seemed that every resource to do away with\r\nhand-sorting had been exhausted, Kirsten asked to be allowed to\r\ntry to catch the diamonds by placing a coat of thick grease on the\r\nsurface of the percussion table with which the other experiments\r\nhad been made. Kirsten had noticed that oily substances, such as\r\naxle grease and white or red lead, adhered to diamonds when they\r\nchanced to come into contact, and, he argued to himself, if these\r\nsubstances adhered to diamonds and not to the other minerals in\r\nthe concentrates, why should not diamonds adhere to grease on the\r\ntable and the other minerals flow away? In this way the remarkable\r\ndiscovery was made that diamonds alone of all minerals contained\r\nin the blue ground will adhere to grease, and that all others will\r\nflow away as tailings over the end of the percussion table with\r\nthe water. After this was determined by thorough experiments,\r\nmore suitable shaking tables were constructed at the Company’s\r\nworkshops. These were from time to time improved upon, until now\r\nall the sorting (except for the very coarse size) is done by these\r\nmachines, whose power of distinction is far superior to the\r\nkeenest eye of the native.\r\n\r\nOnly about ⅓ of 1 per cent of diamonds is lost by the first table,\r\nand these are recovered almost to a stone when the concentrates are\r\npassed over the second table. The discrimination of this sorter\r\nis truly marvellous. Native workers, although experienced in the\r\nhandling of diamonds, often pick out small crystals of zircon, or\r\nDutch boart, by mistake, but the senseless machine is practically\r\nunerring.\r\n\r\nThe grease containing the diamonds, together with a small\r\npercentage of very heavy minerals, such as iron pyrites and\r\nbarytes, is scraped from the tables, placed in buckets made of\r\nsteel plates with fine perforations, and boiled or steamed. The\r\ngrease passes away to tanks of water, where it is cooled and is\r\nagain fit for use. The diamonds, together with small bits of iron\r\npyrites, brass nails from the miners’ boots, pieces of copper\r\nfrom the detonator used in blasting, which remain on the tables\r\nowing to their high specific gravity, and a very small admixture\r\nof worthless deposit which has become mechanically mixed with the\r\ngrease, are then boiled in a solution containing caustic soda,\r\nwhere they are freed from all grease. The quantity of deposit from\r\nthe size of ⅝ of an inch downwards, which now reaches the sorting\r\ntable, does not exceed 1 cubic foot for every 12,000 loads (192,000\r\ncubic feet) of blue ground washed. As already stated, 5/12 of 1\r\nper cent of the whole mass of blue formerly passed to the sorting\r\ntables; or, from 12,000 loads, which is about the daily average of\r\nthe quantity washed at De Beers and Kimberley Mines, 800 cubic feet\r\nhad to be assorted by hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YIELD OF DIAMONDS\r\n\r\nSometimes as many as 8000 carats of diamonds come from the pulsator\r\nin one day, representing about £20,000 in value.\r\n\r\nWhen the bare statement is made that nearly 5,000,000 truck-loads,\r\nor more than 4,000,000 tons of blue ground, have been washed in a\r\nyear, the mind only faintly conceives the prodigious size of the\r\nmass that is annually drawn from the old craters and laboriously\r\nwashed and sorted for the sake of a few bucketfuls of diamonds. It\r\nwould form a cube of more than 430 feet, or a block larger than any\r\ncathedral in the world, and overtopping the spire of St. Paul’s,\r\nwhile a box with sides measuring 2 feet 9 inches would hold the\r\ngems. From two to three million carats of diamonds are turned out\r\nof the De Beers mines in a year, and as 5,000,000 carats go to the\r\nton, this represents half a ton of diamonds. To the end of 1892 10\r\ntons of diamonds had come from this mine, valued at £60,000,000\r\nsterling. This mass of blazing diamonds could be accommodated in a\r\nbox 5 feet square and 6 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is a luxury, and there is only a limited demand\r\nfor it throughout the world. From four to four and a half\r\nmillions sterling is as much as is spent annually in diamonds;\r\nif the production is not regulated by the demand, there will be\r\nover-production, and the trade will suffer. By regulating the\r\noutput the directors have succeeded in maintaining prices since the\r\nconsolidation in 1888.\r\n\r\nThe blue ground varies in its yield of diamonds in different mines,\r\nbut is pretty constant in the same mine. In 1890 the yield per load\r\nof blue ground was:\r\n\r\n                                  CARATS\r\n  From the Kimberley Mine from  1·25 to 1·5\r\n     ”     De Beers Mine    ”   1·20  ” 1·3\r\n     ”     Dutoitspan Mine  ”   0·17  ” 0·5\r\n     ”     Bultfontein Mine ”   0·5   ” 0·33\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF DIAMONDS\r\n\r\nFANCY STONES\r\n\r\nDiamonds occur in all shades, from deep yellow to pure white and\r\njet black, from deep brown to light cinnamon, also green, blue,\r\npink, yellow, orange, and opaque.\r\n\r\nBoth in Kimberley and De Beers the blue ground on the west side\r\nis poorer in diamonds than the blue ground in other parts of the\r\nmines. The diamonds from the west side also differ somewhat from\r\nthose in other parts of the same mine.\r\n\r\nThe diamonds from each mine have a distinctive character, and so\r\nuniform are the characteristics that an experienced buyer can\r\ntell at once the locality of any particular parcel of stones. An\r\nisolated stone may, of course, be found occasionally in any one\r\nmine which is characteristic of some other source of production,\r\nbut this is the exception to the general rule.\r\n\r\nThere is a great similarity between the produce of the De Beers and\r\nKimberley mines. A day’s wash from either of these mines could be\r\ndistinguished from each other, but not so easily the majority of\r\nthe individual stones.\r\n\r\nThe Kimberley Mine produces a small percentage of white crystals,\r\noctahedral in shape, is noted for its large macles, and, in common\r\nwith the De Beers Mine, it also yields a large percentage of\r\ncoloured and large yellow diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe De Beers Mine produces a comparatively small percentage of\r\nreally white diamonds, but is noted for its fine silvery capes.\r\n\r\nThe Dutoitspan Mine is noted for its fine white cleavages, silver\r\ncapes, large yellows, and an exceptional proportion of large stones\r\ngenerally. It also produces a small proportion of fine white,\r\noctahedral-shaped crystals and a comparatively small proportion of\r\ndiamonds below 0·2 of a carat in size.\r\n\r\nThe Bultfontein Mine produces a very large percentage of white\r\ndiamonds, mostly octahedral in shape and generally small in size.\r\nIt produces very few coloured stones, but a larger percentage of\r\nflawed and spotted stones than any other mine. Even the apparently\r\npure stones from this mine frequently develop flaws in cutting,\r\nwhich in the rough were imperceptible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nThe Wesselton Mine diamonds are noted for an abnormally large\r\npercentage of octahedral stones, a large proportion of which are\r\nfree from flaws. White and brown stones predominate in this mine;\r\nthere is almost an entire absence of the ordinary yellow, but very\r\nfine golden-coloured fancy stones are unearthed occasionally,\r\ninvariably in the form of cleavage, and hardly ever exceeding 2\r\ncarats each in weight.\r\n\r\nFor “golden fancies” this mine is unrivalled. Wesselton diamonds\r\nare easily distinguished from the produce of every other mine by a\r\ndecided gloss common to them.\r\n\r\nWesselton produces more stones of 10 carats each and over than\r\nBultfontein, but comparatively few large stones of over 50 carats\r\neach. It produces a very large percentage of small diamonds under\r\n0·2 of a carat. With Bultfontein it shares the distinction of\r\nyielding cubical stones occasionally. It also produces a small\r\npercentage of blue-whites.\r\n\r\nThe Frank Smith Mine produces very fine white diamonds, fairly\r\nregular in shape, mostly octahedral, and hardly any coloured\r\nstones. Many of the stones are grooved at the edges.\r\n\r\nThe Kamfersdam Mine yields diamonds of very inferior quality, dark\r\nbrown being the predominating colour, and even the majority of the\r\nbetter-class stones from this mine are faintly tinged with brown.\r\n\r\nThe Kimberley West, formerly known as Theron’s Mine, situated about\r\n30 miles due west of Kimberley, yields a very small percentage of\r\nblue-whites, fine “silver capes,” and a large proportion of brown\r\ndiamonds, somewhat better in quality than Kamfersdam and more\r\nregular in shape. The diamonds from this mine present a distinctly\r\n“alluvial” appearance, but they are nevertheless distinctive in\r\ncharacter from river diamonds and much inferior in quality.\r\n\r\nThe diamonds from the Leicester Mine are of a distinctive\r\ncharacter; they are very much grooved, extremely bad shapes for\r\ncutting, and many of the stones are cross-grained.\r\n\r\nThe Newlands Mine, West Griqualand, about 40 miles north-west\r\nof Kimberley, is interesting on account of the occurrence of\r\ndiamond in what the Reverend Professor Bonney considers to be its\r\ntrue matrix. The workmen occasionally come across well-rounded,\r\nboulder-like masses of eclogite, a rather coarsely crystalline\r\nrock, sometimes more than a foot in diameter. Some of these\r\nboulders have diamonds imbedded in them. One piece examined by\r\nProfessor Bonney measured approximately 4 inches by 3 inches by\r\n2 inches, and appeared to have been broken off a larger eclogite\r\nboulder. In it were seen ten diamonds, mostly well-crystallised\r\noctahedra, perfectly colourless, with brilliant lustre, four of\r\nthem being comprised within a space of a quarter of an inch square.\r\nAll these diamonds were on the surface. Probably others would have\r\nbeen found inside, but it was not considered desirable to destroy\r\nthe specimen by breaking it up. It is now in the Natural History\r\nMuseum, having been presented by the Directors of the Newlands Mine.\r\n\r\nEclogite has been found in other diamond mines, but I am not aware\r\nthat diamonds have been found imbedded in it except in the Newlands\r\nMine.\r\n\r\nStones from Jagersfontein, in the Orange River Colony, display\r\ngreat purity of colour and brilliancy, and they have the so-called\r\n“steely” lustre characteristic of old Indian gems.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALLING OFF OF YIELD WITH DEPTH\r\n\r\nAccording to tables furnished by the De Beers Company, the yield\r\nof the De Beers and Kimberley mines has declined as the depth\r\nincreases. At the same time the value of the stones has risen, and\r\ndiamonds are more expensive to-day than at any previous time.\r\n\r\n           NUMBER OF      VALUE\r\n  YEAR     CARATS[5]    PER CARAT\r\n           PER LOAD     _s._  _d._\r\n  1889      1·283        19   8·75\r\n  1890      1·15         32   6·75\r\n  1891      0·99         29   6\r\n  1892      0·92         25   6\r\n  1893      1·05         29   0·6\r\n  1894      0·89         24   5·2\r\n  1895      0·85         25   6\r\n  1896      0·91         26   9·4\r\n  1897      0·92         26  10·6\r\n  1898      0·80         26   6·2\r\n  1899      0·71         29   7·2\r\n  1900      0·67         35  10·2\r\n  1901      0·76         39   7\r\n  1902      0·76         46   5·7\r\n  1903      0·61         48   6·3\r\n  1904      0·54         48  11·8\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONES OTHER THAN DIAMONDS\r\n\r\nAccompanying diamonds in the concentrates are a number of other\r\nminerals of high specific gravity, and some of notable beauty.\r\nAmong these are the rich red pyrope (garnet), sp. gr. 3·7,\r\ncontaining from 1·4 to 3 per cent of oxide of chromium; zircon,\r\nin flesh-coloured grains and crystals, sp. gr. 4 to 4·7; kyanite,\r\nsp. gr. 3·45 to 3·7, discernible by its blue colour and perfect\r\ncleavage; chrome diopside, sp. gr. 3·23 to 3·5, of a bright green\r\ncolour; bronzite, sp. gr. 3·1 to 3·3; magnetite, sp. gr. 4·9 to\r\n5·2; mixed chrome and titanium iron ore, sp. gr. 4·4 to 4·9,\r\ncontaining from 13 to 61 per cent of oxide of chromium, and from\r\n3 to 68 per cent of titanic acid, in, changeable quantities;\r\nhornblende, sp. gr. 2·9 to 3·4; barytes, sp. gr. 4·3 to 4·7; and\r\nmica. Some of the garnets are of fine quality, and one was recently\r\ncut which resembled a pigeonblood ruby, and attracted an offer of\r\n£25.\r\n\r\nIn the pulsator and sorting house most of the native labourers\r\nare long-sentence convicts, supplied with food, clothing, and\r\nmedical attendance by the Company. They are necessarily well\r\nguarded. I myself saw about 1000 convicts at work. I was told that\r\ninsubordination is very rare; apart from the hopelessness of a\r\nsuccessful rising, there is little inducement to revolt; the lot\r\nof these diamond workers is preferable to life in the Government\r\nprisons, and they seem contented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. DE BEERS DIAMOND OFFICE. 25,000 CARATS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. DE BEERS DIAMOND OFFICE. THE VALUATORS’\r\nTABLE.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 72.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE DIAMOND OFFICE\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the pulsator the diamonds are sent to the general office\r\nin Kimberley to be cleansed in a boiling mixture of nitric and\r\nsulphuric acids. A parcel of diamonds loses about half a part per\r\n1000 by this treatment. On one of my visits to the diamond office\r\nthe door opened and in walked two young men, each carrying a large\r\nenamelled saucepan containing something steaming hot. They went to\r\none of the zinc-covered tables and turned out from the saucepans a\r\nlustrous heap of 25,000 carats of diamonds (Fig. 10). They had just\r\nbeen boiled in acid and washed.\r\n\r\nAfter purification the diamonds are handed to the valuators (Fig.\r\n11), who sort them into classes, according to size, colour, and\r\npurity. In the diamond office they are sorted into ten classes. In\r\nthe year 1895, in 1141·8 carats of stones, the proportions of the\r\ndifferent classes were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Close goods (best stones)         53·8\r\n  Spotted stones                    75·8\r\n  Fine cleavage                     79·1\r\n  Flats                             39·5\r\n  Macles                            36·5\r\n  Ordinary and rejection cleavage  243·4\r\n  Rejection stones                  43·2\r\n  Light and brown cleavage          56·9\r\n  Rubbish                          371·8\r\n                                  ------\r\n                                  1000·0\r\n                                  ------\r\n  Fine sand                        141·8\r\n                                  ------\r\n                                  1141·8\r\n\r\nIt is a sight for Aladdin to see the valuators at work in the\r\nstrong-room of the De Beers Company at Kimberley. The tables are\r\nliterally heaped with stones won from the rough blue ground--stones\r\nof all sizes, purified, flashing, and of inestimable price; stones\r\nthat will be coveted by men and women all the world over; and\r\nlast, but not least, stones that are probably destined to largely\r\ninfluence the development and history of a whole huge continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nNOTEWORTHY DIAMONDS\r\n\r\n\r\nProdigious diamonds are not so uncommon as is generally supposed.\r\nDiamonds weighing over an ounce (151·5 carats) are not unfrequent\r\nat Kimberley. Some years ago, in one parcel of stones, I saw eight\r\nperfect ounce crystals, and one stone weighing 2 ounces (Fig.\r\n12). The largest diamond from the Kimberley mines weighed 428½\r\ncarats, or nearly 4 ounces troy. It measured 1⅞ inch through the\r\nlongest axis and was 1½ inch square. After cutting it weighed 228½\r\ncarats, losing 200 carats in the process. The largest known diamond\r\nwas discovered in January, 1905, at the New Premier Mine, near\r\nPretoria. This mine is of the same type as the Kimberley mines, but\r\nlarger in size, and, in fact, is the largest known diamantiferous\r\npipe in the world--the pipe containing the “blue ground,” along\r\nthe longer diameter of its oval-shaped cross-section, measuring\r\nover half a mile, and its area is estimated at 350,000 square\r\nyards. This pipe breaks through felsitic rocks. The diamond, called\r\n“Cullinan” from the name of one of the directors of the company\r\non whose farm it was discovered, was presented to King Edward on\r\nhis birthday by the people of the Transvaal. It weighed no less\r\nthan 3025¾ carats, or 9586·5 grains (1·37 lb. avoirdupois). It was\r\na fragment, probably less than half, of a distorted octahedral\r\ncrystal; the other portions still await discovery by some fortunate\r\nminer. The frontispiece shows this diamond in its natural size,\r\nfrom a photograph taken by myself. I had an opportunity of\r\nexamining and experimenting with this unequalled stone before it\r\nwas cut. A beam of polarised light passed in any direction through\r\nthe stone, and then through an analyser, revealed colours in all\r\ncases, appearing brightest when the light passed along the greatest\r\ndiameter--about 4 inches. Here the colours were very fine, but\r\nno regular figure was to be seen. Round a small black spot in\r\nthe interior of the stone the colours were very vivid, changing\r\nand rotating round the spot as the analyser was turned. These\r\nobservations indicated internal strain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. A GROUP OF LARGE DIAMOND CRYSTALS.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 76.]\r\n\r\nThe clearness throughout was remarkable, the stone being absolutely\r\nlimpid like water, with the exception of a few flaws, dark\r\ngraphitic spots, and coloured patches close to the outside. At one\r\npart near the surface there was an internal crack, showing well\r\nthe colours of thin plates. At another point there was a milky,\r\nopaque mass, of a brown colour, with pieces of what looked like\r\niron oxide. There were four cleavage planes of great smoothness and\r\nregularity. On other parts of the surface the crystalline structure\r\nwas very marked. The edges were rounded in parts, and triangular\r\nmarkings (depressions) were to be seen. I also noticed square\r\ndepressions, nearly as sharp and perfect as the triangular ones.\r\n\r\nThe cleaving and cutting and polishing of the Cullinan diamond\r\nwas entrusted to the firm of Asscher and Co., in Amsterdam. The\r\ncleavage of the diamond was very successfully accomplished by Mr.\r\nJoseph Asscher. An incision half an inch deep was made with a sharp\r\ndiamond point in the proper place, then a specially designed knife\r\nblade was placed in the incision and it was struck a heavy blow\r\nwith a piece of steel. The diamond split through a defective spot,\r\npart of which was left in each portion of the diamond.\r\n\r\nGigantic as is the Cullinan diamond, it represents in weight less\r\nthan half the daily output of the De Beers mines, which averages\r\nabout 7000 carats per day.\r\n\r\nNext in size to the Cullinan comes the one which was found at the\r\nJagersfontein Mine. It weighed 970 carats--over half a pound.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the names and weights of some historic\r\ndiamonds (Fig. 13):\r\n\r\n   1. Koh-i-noor, after the second cutting, 106 carats.\r\n\r\n   2. Loterie d’Angleterre, 49 carats.\r\n\r\n   3. Nizam of Hyderabad, 279 carats.\r\n\r\n   4. Orloff, 194 carats.\r\n\r\n   5. Koh-i-noor, after first cutting, 279 carats.\r\n\r\n   6. Regent or Pitt, 137 carats.\r\n\r\n   7. Duke of Tuscany, 133 carats.\r\n\r\n   8. Star of the South, 124 carats.\r\n\r\n   9. Pole Star, 40 carats.\r\n\r\n  10. Tiffany, yellow, 125 carats.\r\n\r\n  11. Hope, blue diamond, 44 carats.\r\n\r\n  12. Sancy, 53 carats.\r\n\r\n  13. Empress Eugenie, 51 carats.\r\n\r\n  14.

SOME HISTORIC DIAMONDS.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 80.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBOART, CARBONADO, AND GRAPHITE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe black inclusions in some transparent diamonds consist of\r\ngraphite. On crushing a clear diamond showing such spots and\r\nheating in oxygen to a temperature well below the point at which\r\ndiamond begins to burn, Moissan found that the grey tint of the\r\npowder disappeared, no black spots being seen under the microscope.\r\nThere also occur what may be considered intermediate forms between\r\nthe well-crystallised diamond and graphite. These are “boart” and\r\n“carbonado.” Boart is an imperfectly crystallised diamond, having\r\nno clear portions, and therefore useless for gems. Shot boart is\r\nfrequently found in spherical globules, and may be of all colours.\r\nOrdinary boart is so hard that it is used in rock-drilling,\r\nand when crushed it is employed for cutting and polishing other\r\nstones. Carbonado is the Brazilian term for a still less perfectly\r\ncrystallised form of carbon. It is equally hard, and occurs in\r\nporous masses and in massive black pebbles, sometimes weighing two\r\nor more ounces.\r\n\r\nThe ash left after burning a diamond invariably contains iron as\r\nits chief constituent; and the most common colours of diamonds,\r\nwhen not perfectly pellucid, show various shades of brown and\r\nyellow, from the palest “off colour” to almost black. These\r\nvariations give support to the theory advanced by Moissan that\r\nthe diamond has separated from molten iron--a theory of which I\r\nshall say more presently--and also explain how it happens that\r\nstones from different mines, and even from different parts of the\r\nsame mine, differ from each other. Further confirmation is given\r\nby the fact that the country round Kimberley is remarkable for\r\nits ferruginous character, and iron-saturated soil is popularly\r\nregarded as one of the indications of the near presence of diamonds.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPHITE\r\n\r\nIntermediate between soft carbon and diamond come the graphites.\r\nThe name graphite is given to a variety of carbon, generally\r\ncrystalline, which in an oxidising mixture of chlorate of potassium\r\nand nitric acid forms graphitic oxide. This varies in colour\r\nfrom green to brown or yellow, or it is almost without colour,\r\naccording to the completeness of the reaction. Graphites are of\r\nvarying densities, from 2·0 to 3·0, and generally of crystalline\r\naspect. Graphite and diamond pass insensibly into one another. Hard\r\ngraphite and soft diamond are near the same specific gravity. The\r\ndifference appears to be one of pressure at the time of formation.\r\n\r\nSome forms of graphite exhibit the remarkable property by which\r\nit is possible to ascertain approximately the temperature at\r\nwhich they were formed, or to which they have subsequently been\r\nexposed. Sprouting graphite is a form, frequently met with in\r\nnature, which on moderate heating swells up to a bulky, very\r\nlight mass of amorphous carbon. Moissan has found it in blue\r\nground from Kimberley; my own results verify his. When obtained by\r\nsimple elevation of temperature in the arc or the electric furnace\r\ngraphites do not sprout; but when they are formed by dissolving\r\ncarbon in a metal at a high temperature and then allowing the\r\ngraphite to separate out on cooling, the sprouting variety appears.\r\nThe phenomenon of sprouting is easily shown. If a few grains are\r\nplaced in a test-tube and heated to about 170° C., the grains\r\nincrease enormously in bulk and fill the tube with a light form of\r\namorphous carbon.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of a graphite to oxidising agents is greater the\r\nhigher the temperature to which it has previously been exposed.\r\nGraphites which are easily attacked by a mixture of fuming nitric\r\nacid and potassium chlorate are rendered more resistant by strong\r\nheat in the electric furnace.\r\n\r\nI have already signified that there are various degrees of\r\nrefractoriness to chemical reagents among the different forms of\r\ngraphite. Some dissolve in strong nitric acid; other forms of\r\ngraphite require a mixture of highly concentrated nitric acid and\r\npotassium chlorate to attack them, and even with this intensely\r\npowerful agent some graphites resist longer than others. M. Moissan\r\nhas shown that the power of resistance to nitric acid and potassium\r\nchlorate is in proportion to the temperature at which the graphite\r\nwas formed, and with tolerable certainty we can estimate this\r\ntemperature by the resistance of the specimen of graphite to this\r\nreagent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRYSTALLISATION\r\n\r\nThe diamond belongs to the isometric system of crystallography; the\r\nprevailing form is octahedral. It frequently occurs with curved\r\nfaces and edges. Twin crystals (macles) are not uncommon. Diamond\r\ncrystals are generally perfect on all sides. They seldom show\r\nirregular sides or faces by which they were attached to a support,\r\nas do artificial crystals of chemical salts; another proof that the\r\ndiamond must have crystallised from a dense liquid.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration (Fig. 14) shows some of the various\r\ncrystalline forms of native diamonds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. CRYSTALLINE FORMS OF NATIVE DIAMONDS.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 86.]\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Diamond in the form of a hexakis-octahedron (the forty-eight\r\nscalenohedron), or a solid figure contained by forty-eight scalene\r\ntriangles. According to Professor Maskelyne, this occurs as a\r\nself-existent form only in the diamond.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Diamond in the form of a hexakis-octahedron and\r\noctahedron. From Sudafrika.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Diamond in the form of octahedron with intersections.\r\n\r\nNo. 4. Diamond from Brazil.\r\n\r\nNo. 5. Diamond from Kimberley.\r\n\r\nNo. 6. Diamond from Brazil.\r\n\r\nNo, 7. A macle or twin crystal, showing its formation from an\r\noctahedron with curved edges.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome crystals of diamonds have their surfaces beautifully marked\r\nwith equilateral triangles, interlaced and of varying sizes\r\n(Fig. 15). Under the microscope these markings appear as hollow\r\ndepressions sharply cut out of the surrounding surface, and\r\nthese depressions were supposed by Gustav Rose to indicate the\r\nprobability that the diamonds had at some previous time been\r\nexposed to incipient combustion. Rose pointed out that similar\r\ntriangular striations appeared on the surfaces of diamonds burnt\r\nbefore the blowpipe. This experiment I have repeated on a clear\r\ndiamond, and I have satisfied myself that during combustion\r\nbefore the blowpipe, in the field of a microscope, the surface is\r\netched with triangular markings different in character from those\r\nnaturally on crystals (Fig. 16). The artificial striæ are very\r\nirregular, much smaller, and massed closer together, looking as\r\nif the diamond during combustion flaked away in triangular chips,\r\nwhile the markings natural to crystals appear as if produced by\r\nthe crystallising force as they were being built up. Many crystals\r\nof chemical compounds appear striated from both these causes.\r\nGeometrical markings can be produced by eroding the surface of a\r\ncrystal of alum with water, and they also occur naturally during\r\ncrystallisation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. TRIANGULAR MARKINGS ON NATURAL FACE OF A\r\nDIAMOND CRYSTAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. TRIANGULAR MARKINGS ARTIFICIALLY PRODUCED\r\nON A DIAMOND CRYSTAL.\r\n\r\n  To face page 88.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE DIAMOND\r\n\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say the diamond is almost pure carbon, and it is\r\nthe hardest substance in nature.\r\n\r\nWhen heated in air or oxygen to a temperature varying from 760°\r\nto 875° C., according to its hardness, the diamond burns with\r\nproduction of carbonic acid. It leaves an extremely light ash,\r\nsometimes retaining the shape of the crystal, consisting of iron,\r\nlime, magnesia, silica, and titanium. In boart and carbonado\r\nthe amount of ash sometimes rises to 4 per cent, but in clear\r\ncrystallised diamonds it is seldom higher than 0·05 per cent. By\r\nfar the largest constituent of the ash is iron.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the temperatures of combustion in oxygen\r\nof different kinds of carbon:\r\n\r\n                                                      °C.\r\n  Condensed vapour of carbon                          650\r\n  Carbon from sugar, heated in an electrical furnace  660\r\n  Artificial graphites, generally                     660\r\n  Graphite from ordinary cast-iron                    670\r\n  Carbon from blue ground, of an ochre colour         690\r\n  Carbon from blue ground, very hard and black        710\r\n  Diamond, soft Brazilian                             760\r\n  Diamond, hard Kimberley                             780\r\n  Boart from Brazil                                   790\r\n  Boart from Kimberley                                790\r\n  Boart, very hard, almost impossible to cut          900\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDNESS\r\n\r\nDiamonds vary considerably in hardness, and even different parts\r\nof the same crystal differ in their resistance to cutting and\r\ngrinding.\r\n\r\nBeautifully white diamonds have been found at Inverel, New South\r\nWales, and from the rich yield of the mine and the white colour of\r\nthe stones great things were expected. In the first parcel which\r\ncame to England the stones were found to be so much harder than\r\nSouth African diamonds that it was at first feared they would be\r\nuseless except for rock-boring purposes. The difficulty of cutting\r\nthem disappeared with improved appliances, and they now are highly\r\nprized.\r\n\r\nThe famous Koh-i-noor, when being cut into its present form, showed\r\na notable variation in hardness. In cutting one of the facets near\r\na yellow flaw, the crystal became harder and harder the further\r\nit was cut, until, after working the mill for six hours at the\r\nusual speed of 2400 revolutions a minute, little impression was\r\nmade. The speed was increased to more than 3000, when the work\r\nslowly proceeded. Other portions of the stone were found to be\r\ncomparatively soft, and became harder as the outside was cut away.\r\n\r\nThe intense hardness of the diamond can be illustrated by the\r\nfollowing experiment. On the flattened apex of a conical block\r\nof steel place a diamond, and upon it bring down a second cone\r\nof steel. On forcing together the two steel cones by hydraulic\r\npressure the stone is squeezed into the steel blocks without\r\ninjuring it in the slightest degree.\r\n\r\nIn an experiment I made at Kimberley the pressure gauge showed 60\r\natmospheres, and the piston being 3·2 inches diameter, the absolute\r\npressure was 3·16 tons, equivalent on a diamond of 12 square mm.\r\nsurface to 170 tons per square inch of diamond.\r\n\r\nThe use of diamond in glass-cutting I need not dwell on. So hard is\r\ndiamond in comparison to glass, that a suitable splinter of diamond\r\nwill plane curls off a glass plate as a carpenter’s tool will plane\r\nshavings off a deal board. The illustration (Fig. 17) shows a few\r\ndiamond-cut glass shavings.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENSITY OR SPECIFIC GRAVITY\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of the diamond varies ordinarily from 3·514\r\nto 3·518. For comparison, I give in tabular form the specific\r\ngravities of the different varieties of carbon and of the minerals\r\nfound on the sorting tables:\r\n\r\n                            SPECIFIC\r\n                            GRAVITY.\r\n  Amorphous carbon        1·45-1·70\r\n  Hard gas coke                2·356\r\n  Hard graphite                2·5\r\n  Quartzite and granite        2·6\r\n  Beryl                        2·7\r\n  Mica                         2·8\r\n  Hornblende                   3·0\r\n  Boart                   3·47-3·49\r\n  Carbonado                    3·50\r\n  Diamond                3·514-3·518\r\n  Garnet                       3·7\r\n  Corundum                     3·8\r\n  Zircon                       4·4\r\n  Barytes                      4·5\r\n  Chrome and titanic iron ore  4·7\r\n  Magnetite                    5·0\r\n\r\nThere is a substance, the double nitrate of silver and thallium,\r\nwhich, while solid at ordinary temperatures, liquefies at 75° C.\r\nand then has a specific gravity of 4·5. Admixture with water lowers\r\nthe density to any desired point.\r\n\r\nIf a glass cell is taken containing this liquid diluted to a\r\ndensity of about 3·6, and in it is thrown pieces of the above-named\r\nminerals, all those whose density is lower than 3·6 will rise to\r\nthe surface, while the denser minerals will sink. If now a little\r\nwater is carefully added with constantly stirring until the density\r\nof the liquid is reduced to that of the diamond, the heterogeneous\r\ncollection sorts itself into three parts. The graphite, quartz,\r\nberyl, mica, and hornblende rise to the surface; the garnet,\r\ncorundum, zircons, etc., sink to the bottom, while the diamonds\r\nfloat in the middle of the liquid. With a platinum landing-net I\r\ncan skim off the swimmers and put them into one dish; with the\r\nsame net I can fish out the diamonds and put them in a second\r\ndish, while by raising a sieve at the bottom I can remove the heavy\r\nminerals and put them into a third. The accurate separation of\r\ndiamonds from the heterogeneous mixture can be effected in less\r\ntime than is taken to describe the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe table shows that diamonds vary somewhat in density among\r\nthemselves, between narrow limits. Occasionally, however, diamonds\r\noverpass these figures. Here is an illustration. In a test-tube of\r\nthe same dense liquid are three selected diamonds. One rises to the\r\ntop, another floats uncertain where to settle, rising and falling\r\nas the temperature of the sorting liquid is raised or lowered,\r\nwhilst the third sinks to the bottom. Allowing the liquid to cool\r\na degree or two slightly increases the density and sends all three\r\nto the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORESCENCE OF DIAMOND\r\n\r\nAfter exposure for some time to the sun many diamonds glow in\r\na dark room. Some diamonds are fluorescent, appearing milky in\r\nsunlight. In a vacuum, exposed to a high-tension current of\r\nelectricity, diamonds phosphoresce of different colours, most South\r\nAfrican diamonds shining with a bluish light. Diamonds from other\r\nlocalities emit bright blue, apricot, pale blue, red, yellowish\r\ngreen, orange, and pale green light. The most phosphorescent\r\ndiamonds are those which are fluorescent in the sun. One beautiful\r\ngreen diamond in the writer’s collection, when phosphorescing in a\r\ngood vacuum, gives almost as much light as a candle, and you can\r\neasily read by its rays. But the time has hardly come when diamonds\r\ncan be used as domestic illuminants! The emitted light is pale\r\ngreen, tending to white, and in its spectrum, when strong, can be\r\nseen bright lines, one at about λ 5370 in the green, one at λ 5130\r\nin the greenish blue, and one at λ 5030 in the blue. A beautiful\r\ncollection of diamond crystals belonging to Professor Maskelyne\r\nphosphoresces with nearly all the colours of the rainbow, the\r\ndifferent faces glowing with different shades of colour. Diamonds\r\nwhich phosphoresce red generally show the yellow sodium line on\r\na continuous spectrum. In one Brazilian diamond phosphorescing a\r\nreddish-yellow colour I detected in its spectrum the citron line\r\ncharacteristic of yttrium.\r\n\r\nThe rays which make the diamond phosphoresce are high in the\r\nultra-violet. To illustrate this phosphorescence under the\r\ninfluence of the ultra-violet rays, arrange a powerful source\r\nof these rays, and in front expose a design made up of certain\r\nminerals, willemite, franklinite, calcite, etc.--phosphorescing\r\nof different colours. Their brilliant glow ceases entirely when a\r\nthin piece of glass is interposed between them and the ultra-violet\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\nI now draw attention to a strange property of the diamond, which\r\nat first sight might seem to discount the great permanence and\r\nunalterability of this stone. It has been ascertained that the\r\ncause of phosphorescence is in some way connected with the\r\nhammering of the electrons, violently driven from the negative\r\npole on to the surface of the body under examination, and so great\r\nis the energy of the bombardment, that impinging on a piece of\r\nplatinum or even iridium, the metal will actually melt. When the\r\ndiamond is thus bombarded in a radiant matter tube the result is\r\nstartling. It not only phosphoresces, but becomes discoloured,\r\nand in course of time becomes black on the surface. Some diamonds\r\nblacken in the course of a few minutes, while others require an\r\nhour or more to discolour. This blackening is only superficial,\r\nand although no ordinary means of cleaning will remove the\r\ndiscolouration, it goes at once when the stone is polished with\r\ndiamond powder. Ordinary oxidising reagents have little or no\r\neffect in restoring the colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. DIAMOND-CUT GLASS AND SHAVINGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. DIAMONDS IN RÖNTGEN RAYS.\r\n\r\n  A. BLACK DIAMOND IN GOLD FRAME.\r\n  B. PINK DELHI DIAMOND.\r\n  C. PASTE IMITATION OF B.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 98.]\r\n\r\nThe superficial dark coating on a diamond after exposure to\r\nmolecular bombardment I have proved to be graphite. M. Moissan has\r\nshown that this graphite, on account of its great resistance to\r\noxidising reagents, cannot have been formed at a lower temperature\r\nthan 3600° C.\r\n\r\nIt is thus manifest that the bombarding electrons, striking the\r\ndiamond with enormous velocity, raise the superficial layer to the\r\ntemperature of the electric arc and turn it into graphite, whilst\r\nthe mass of diamond and its conductivity to heat are sufficient to\r\nkeep down the general temperature to such a point that the tube\r\nappears scarcely more than warm to the touch.\r\n\r\nA similar action occurs with silver, the superficial layers of\r\nwhich can be raised to a red heat without the whole mass becoming\r\nmore than warm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVERSION OF DIAMOND INTO GRAPHITE\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot convert graphite into diamond, we can change\r\nthe diamond into graphite. A clear crystal of diamond is placed\r\nbetween two carbon poles, and the poles with intervening diamond\r\nare brought together and an arc formed between. The temperature of\r\nthe diamond rapidly rises, and when it approaches 3600° C., the\r\nvaporising point of carbon, it breaks down, swells, and changes\r\ninto black and valueless graphite.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIBO-LUMINESCENCE\r\n\r\nA few minerals give out light when rubbed. In the year 1663 the\r\nHon. Robert Boyle read a paper before the Royal Society, in which\r\nhe described several experiments made with a diamond which markedly\r\nshowed tribo-luminescence. As specimens of tribo-luminescent bodies\r\nI may instance sphalerite (sulphide of zinc), and an artificial\r\nsphalerite, which is even more responsive to friction than the\r\nnative sulphide.[6]\r\n\r\nMrs. Kunz, wife of the well-known New York mineralogist, possesses,\r\nperhaps, the most remarkable of all phosphorescing diamonds. This\r\nprodigy diamond will phosphoresce in the dark for some minutes\r\nafter being exposed to a small pocket electric light, and if rubbed\r\non a piece of cloth a long streak of phosphorescence appears.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSORPTION SPECTRUM OF DIAMOND\r\n\r\nOn passing a ray of light through a diamond and examining it in a\r\nspectroscope, Walter has found in all colourless brilliants of over\r\n1 carat in weight an absorption band at wave-length 4155 (violet).\r\nHe ascribes this band to an impurity and suggests it may possibly\r\nbe due to samarium. Three other fainter lines were detected in the\r\nultra-violet by means of photography.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFRACTIVITY\r\n\r\nBut it is not the hardness of the diamond so much as its optical\r\nqualities that make it so highly prized. It is one of the most\r\nrefracting substances in nature, and it also has the highest\r\nreflecting properties. In the cutting of diamonds advantage is\r\ntaken of these qualities. When cut as a brilliant the facets on\r\nthe lower side are inclined so that light falls on them at an\r\nangle of 24° 13´, at which angle all the incident light is totally\r\nreflected. A well-cut brilliant should appear opaque by transmitted\r\nlight except at a small spot in the middle where the table and\r\nculet are opposite. All the light falling on the front of the\r\nstone is reflected from the facets, and the light passing into the\r\ndiamond is reflected from the interior surfaces and refracted\r\ninto colours when it passes out into the air, giving rise to the\r\nlightnings, the effulgence, and coruscations for which the diamond\r\nis supreme above all other gems.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the refractive indices of diamonds and\r\nother bodies:\r\n\r\n\r\nREFRACTIVE INDICES FOR THE D LINE\r\n\r\n  Chromate of lead    2·50-2·97\r\n  Diamond             2·47-2·75\r\n  Phosphorus               2·22\r\n  Sulphur                  2·12\r\n  Ruby                     1·78\r\n  Thallium glass           1·75\r\n  Iceland spar             1·65\r\n  Topaz                    1·61\r\n  Beryl                    1·60\r\n  Emerald                  1·59\r\n  Flint glass              1·58\r\n  Quartz                   1·55\r\n  Canada balsam            1·53\r\n  Crown glass              1·53\r\n  Fluor-spar               1·44\r\n  Ice                      1·31\r\n\r\nIn vain I have searched for a liquid of the same refraction as\r\ndiamond. Such a liquid would be invaluable to the merchant, as\r\non immersing a stone the clear body would absolutely disappear,\r\nleaving in all their ugliness the flaws and black specks so\r\nfrequently seen even in the best stones.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAMOND AND POLARISED LIGHT\r\n\r\nHaving no double refraction, the diamond should not act on\r\npolarised light. But as is well known, if a transparent body which\r\ndoes not so act is submitted to strain of an irregular character\r\nit becomes doubly refracting, and in the polariscope reveals the\r\nexistence of the strain by brilliant colours arranged in a more or\r\nless defined pattern, according to the state of tension in which\r\nthe crystal exists. I have examined many hundred diamond crystals\r\nunder polarised light, and with few exceptions the colours show how\r\ngreat is the strain to which some of them are exposed. On rotating\r\nthe polariser, the black cross most frequently seen revolves round\r\na particular point in the inside of the crystal; on examining\r\nthis point with a high power we sometimes see a slight flaw, more\r\nrarely a minute cavity. The cavity is filled with gas at enormous\r\npressure, and the strain is set up in the stone by the effort of\r\nthe gas to escape. I have already said that the great Cullinan\r\ndiamond by this means revealed a state of considerable internal\r\nstress and strain.\r\n\r\nSo great is this strain of internal tension that it is not uncommon\r\nfor a diamond to explode soon after it reaches the surface, and\r\nsome have been known to burst in the pockets of the miners or when\r\nheld in the warm hand. Large crystals are more liable to burst than\r\nsmaller pieces. Valuable stones have been destroyed in this way,\r\nand it is whispered that cunning dealers are not averse to allowing\r\nresponsible clients to handle or carry in their warm pockets large\r\ncrystals fresh from the mine. By way of safeguard against explosion\r\nsome dealers imbed large diamonds in raw potato to ensure safe\r\ntransit to England.\r\n\r\nThe anomalous action which many diamonds exert on polarised light\r\nis not such as can be induced by heat, but it can easily be\r\nconferred on diamonds by pressure, showing that the strain has not\r\nbeen produced by sudden cooling, but by sudden lowering of pressure.\r\n\r\nThe illustration of this peculiarity is not only difficult, but\r\nsometimes exceedingly costly--difficult because it is necessary to\r\narrange for projecting on the screen the image of a diamond crystal\r\nbetween the jaws of a hydraulic press, the illuminating light\r\nhaving to pass through delicate optical polarising apparatus--and\r\ncostly because only perfectly clear crystals can be used, and\r\ncrystals of this character sometimes fly to pieces as the pressure\r\nrises. At first no colour is seen on the screen, the crystal not\r\nbeing birefringent. A movement of the handle of the press, however,\r\ngives the crystal a pinch, instantly responded to by the colours on\r\nthe screen, showing the production of double refraction. Another\r\nmovement of the handle brightens the colours, and a third may\r\nstrain the crystal beyond its power of resistance, when the crystal\r\nflies to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAMOND AND RÖNTGEN RAYS\r\n\r\nThe diamond is remarkable in another respect. It is extremely\r\ntransparent to the Röntgen rays, whereas highly refracting glass,\r\nused in imitation diamonds, is almost perfectly opaque to the rays.\r\nI exposed for a few seconds over a photographic plate to the X-rays\r\nthe large Delhi diamond of a rose-pink colour weighing 31½ carats,\r\na black diamond weighing 23 carats, and a glass imitation of the\r\npink diamond (Fig. 18). On development the impression where the\r\ndiamond obscured the rays was found to be strong, showing that\r\nmost rays passed through, while the glass was practically opaque.\r\nBy this means imitation diamonds can readily be distinguished from\r\ntrue gems.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF RADIUM ON DIAMOND\r\n\r\nThe β-rays from radium having like properties to the stream of\r\nnegative electrons in a radiant matter tube, it was of interest to\r\nascertain if they would exert a like difference on diamond. The\r\ndiamond glows under the influence of the β-radiations, and crushed\r\ndiamond cemented to a piece of card or metal makes an excellent\r\nscreen in a spinthariscope--almost as good as zinc sulphide. Some\r\ncolourless crystals of diamond were imbedded in radium bromide and\r\nkept undisturbed for more than twelve months. At the end of that\r\ntime they were examined. The radium had caused them to assume a\r\nbluish-green colour, and their value as “fancy stones” had been\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThis colour is persistent and penetrates below the surface. It\r\nis unaffected by long-continued heating in strong nitric acid and\r\npotassium chlorate, and is not discharged by heating to redness.\r\n\r\nTo find out if this prolonged contact with radium had communicated\r\nto the diamond any radio-active properties, six diamonds were put\r\non a photographic plate and kept in the dark for a few hours. All\r\nshowed radio-activity by darkening the sensitive plate, some being\r\nmore-active than others. Like the green tint, the radio-activity\r\npersists after drastic treatment. To me this proves that\r\nradio-activity does not merely consist in the adhesion of electrons\r\nor emanations given off by radium to the surface of an adjacent\r\nbody, but the property is one involving layers below the surface,\r\nand like the alteration of tint, is probably closely connected with\r\nthe intense molecular excitement the stone had experienced during\r\nits twelve months’ burial in radium bromide.\r\n\r\nA diamond that had been coloured by radium, and had acquired\r\nstrong radio-active properties, was slowly heated to dull redness\r\nin a dark room. Just before visibility a faint phosphorescence\r\nspread over the stone. On cooling and examining the diamond it was\r\nfound that neither the colour nor the radio-activity had suffered\r\nappreciably.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILING- AND MELTING-POINT OF CARBON\r\n\r\nOn the average the critical point of a substance is 1·5 times its\r\nabsolute boiling-point. Therefore the critical point of carbon\r\nshould be about 5800° Ab. But the absolute critical temperature\r\ndivided by the critical pressure is for all the elements so far\r\nexamined never less than 2·5; this being about the value Sir James\r\nDewar finds for hydrogen. So that, accepting this, we get the\r\nmaximum critical pressure as follows, viz. 2320 atmospheres:\r\n\r\n  (5800° Ab.)/CrP = 2.5, or CrP = (5800 Ab.)/2.5,\r\n    or 2320 atmospheres.\r\n\r\nCarbon and arsenic are the only two elements that have a\r\nmelting-point above the boiling-point; and among compounds carbonic\r\nacid and fluoride of silicium are the only other bodies with\r\nsimilar properties. Now the melting-point of arsenic is about\r\n1·2 times its absolute boiling-point. With carbonic acid and\r\nfluoride of silicium the melting-points are about 1·1 times their\r\nboiling-points. Applying these ratios to carbon, we find that its\r\nmelting-point would be about 4400°.\r\n\r\nTherefore, assuming the following data:\r\n\r\n  Boiling-point           3870° Ab.\r\n  Melting-point           4400°\r\n  Critical temperature    5800°\r\n  Critical pressure       2320 Ats.\r\n\r\nthe Rankine or Van der Waals formula, calculated from the\r\nboiling-point and critical data, would be as follows:\r\n\r\n  log. P = 10·11 - 39120/T,\r\n\r\nand this gives for a temperature of 4400° Ab. a pressure of 16·6\r\nAts. as the melting-point pressure. The results of the formula are\r\ngiven in the form of a table:\r\n\r\n  Temperature  Pressure\r\n     Ab.         Ats.\r\n   3870°         1·00 Boiling-point.\r\n   4000°         2·14\r\n   4200°         6·25\r\n   4400°        16·6  Melting-point.\r\n   4600°        40·4\r\n   4800°        91·2\r\n   5000°       193\r\n   5200°       386\r\n   5400°       735\r\n   5600°      1330\r\n   5800°      2320    Critical point (15 tons per square inch).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. CURVE OF VAPOUR PRESSURE OF CARBON]\r\n\r\nIf, then, we may reason from these rough estimates, above a\r\ntemperature of 5800° Ab. no amount of pressure will cause carbon\r\nvapour to assume liquid form, whilst at 4400° Ab. a pressure\r\nof above 17 atmospheres would suffice to liquefy some of it.\r\nBetween these extremes the curve of vapour pressure is assumed to\r\nbe logarithmic, as represented in the accompanying diagram. The\r\nconstant 39120 which occurs in the logarithmic formula enables\r\nus to calculate the latent heat of evaporation. If we assume the\r\nvapour density to be normal, or the molecule in vapour as C_{2},\r\nthen the heat of volatilisation of 12 grms. of carbon would\r\nbe 90,000 calories; or, if the vapour is a condensed molecule\r\nlike C_{6}, then the 12 grms. would need 30,000 calories. In the\r\nlatter case the evaporation of 1 grm. of carbon would require\r\n2500 calories, whereas a substance like zinc needs only about 400\r\ncalories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nGENESIS OF THE DIAMOND\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeculations as to the probable origin of the diamond have been\r\ngreatly forwarded by patient research, and particularly by improved\r\nmeans of obtaining high temperatures, an advance we owe principally\r\nto the researches of the late Professor Moissan.\r\n\r\nUntil recent years carbon was considered absolutely non-volatile\r\nand infusible; but the enormous temperatures placed at the disposal\r\nof experimentalists by the introduction of electricity show\r\nthat, instead of breaking rules, carbon obeys the same laws that\r\ngovern other bodies. It volatilises at the ordinary pressure at a\r\ntemperature of about 3600° C., and passes from the solid to the\r\ngaseous state without liquefying. It has been found that other\r\nbodies, such as arsenic, which volatilise without liquefying at\r\nthe ordinary pressure, will easily liquefy if pressure is added to\r\ntemperature. It naturally follows that if along with the requisite\r\ntemperature sufficient pressure is applied, liquefaction of carbon\r\nwill take place, when on cooling it will crystallise. But carbon at\r\nhigh temperatures is a most energetic chemical agent, and if it can\r\nget hold of oxygen from the atmosphere or any compound containing\r\nit, it will oxidise and fly off in the form of carbonic acid. Heat\r\nand pressure therefore are of no avail unless the carbon can be\r\nkept inert.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that iron, when melted, dissolves carbon,\r\nand on cooling liberates it in the form of graphite. Moissan\r\ndiscovered that several other metals, especially silver, have\r\nsimilar properties; but iron is the best solvent for carbon. The\r\nquantity of carbon entering into solution increases with the\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. MOISSAN’S ELECTRIC FURNACE.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 116.]\r\n\r\nFor the artificial manufacture of diamond the first necessity is\r\nto select pure iron--free from sulphur, silicon, phosphorus,\r\netc.--and to pack it in a carbon crucible with pure charcoal from\r\nsugar. The crucible is then put into the body of the electric\r\nfurnace and a powerful arc formed close above it between carbon\r\npoles, utilising a current of 700 ampères at 40 volts pressure\r\n(Fig. 20). The iron rapidly melts and saturates itself with carbon.\r\nAfter a few minutes’ heating to a temperature above 4000° C.--a\r\ntemperature at which the iron melts like wax and volatilises in\r\nclouds--the current is stopped and the dazzling fiery crucible is\r\nplunged beneath the surface of cold water, where it is held till\r\nit sinks below a red heat. As is well known, iron increases in\r\nvolume at the moment of passing from the liquid to the solid state.\r\nThe sudden cooling solidifies the outer layer of iron and holds\r\nthe inner molten mass in a tight grip. The expansion of the inner\r\nliquid on solidifying produces an enormous pressure, and under the\r\nstress of this pressure the dissolved carbon separates out in\r\ntransparent forms--minutely microscopic, it is true--all the same\r\nveritable diamonds, with crystalline form and appearance, colour,\r\nhardness, and action on light, the same as the natural gem.\r\n\r\nNow commences the tedious part of the process. The metallic ingot\r\nis attacked with hot nitro-hydrochloric acid until no more iron\r\nis dissolved. The bulky residue consists chiefly of graphite,\r\ntogether with translucent chestnut-coloured flakes of carbon,\r\nblack opaque carbon of a density of from 3·0 to 3·5 and hard as\r\ndiamonds--black diamonds or carbonado, in fact--and a small portion\r\nof transparent, colourless diamonds showing crystalline structure.\r\nBesides these there may be carbide of silicon and corundum, arising\r\nfrom impurities in the materials employed.\r\n\r\nThe residue is first heated for some hours with strong sulphuric\r\nacid at the boiling-point, with the cautious addition of powdered\r\nnitre. It is then well washed and for two days allowed to soak in\r\nstrong hydrofluoric acid in cold, then in boiling acid. After this\r\ntreatment the soft graphite disappears, and most, if not all, the\r\nsilicon compounds have been destroyed. Hot sulphuric acid is again\r\napplied to destroy the fluorides, and the residue, well washed, is\r\nattacked with a mixture of the strongest nitric acid and powdered\r\npotassium chlorate, kept warm--but not above 60° C., to avoid\r\nexplosions. This treatment must be repeated six or eight times,\r\nwhen all the hard graphite will gradually be dissolved and little\r\nelse left but graphitic oxide, diamond, and the harder carbonado\r\nand boart. The residue is fused for an hour in fluorhydrate or\r\nfluoride of potassium, then boiled out in water and again heated\r\nin sulphuric acid. The well-washed grains which resist this\r\nenergetic treatment are dried, carefully deposited on a slide, and\r\nexamined under the microscope. Along with numerous pieces of black\r\ndiamond are seen transparent, colourless pieces, some amorphous,\r\nothers with a crystalline appearance. Fig. 21 B shows one of these\r\ncrystalline fragments. Although many fragments of crystals occur,\r\nit is remarkable I have never seen a complete crystal. All appear\r\nshattered, as if on being liberated from the intense pressure\r\nunder which they were formed they burst asunder. I have singular\r\nevidence of this phenomenon. A fine piece of artificial diamond,\r\ncarefully mounted by me on a microscopic slide, exploded during\r\nthe night and covered the slide with fragments. Moissan’s crystals\r\nof artificial diamond sometimes broke a few weeks after their\r\npreparation, and some of the diamonds which cracked weeks or even\r\nmonths after their preparation showed fissures covered with minute\r\ncubes. I have explained that this bursting paroxysm is not unknown\r\nat the Kimberley mines. So far, all such artificial diamonds are\r\nmicroscopic. The largest artificial diamond is less than one\r\nmillimetre across.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. ARTIFICIAL DIAMOND MADE BY THE AUTHOR FROM\r\nMOLTEN IRON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. MOISSAN’S ARTIFICIAL DIAMONDS.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 120.]\r\n\r\nThese laboratory diamonds burn in the air before the blowpipe to\r\ncarbonic acid. In lustre, crystalline form, optical properties,\r\ndensity, and hardness they are identical with the natural stone.\r\n\r\nIn several cases Moissan separated ten to fifteen microscopic\r\ndiamonds from a single ingot. The larger of these are about 0·75\r\nmm. long, the octahedra being 0·2 mm.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustrations (Fig. 22) are copied from drawings\r\nin Moissan’s book _Le Four Electrique_.\r\n\r\nAlong with carbon, molten iron dissolves other bodies which possess\r\ntinctorial powers. We know of blue, green, pink, yellow, and orange\r\ndiamonds. One batch of iron might contain an impurity colouring the\r\nstones blue, another lot would tend towards the formation of pink\r\nstones, another of green, and so on. Cobalt, nickel, chromium, and\r\nmanganese, all metals present in the blue ground, would produce\r\nthese colours.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW FORMATION OF DIAMOND\r\n\r\nI have long speculated as to the possibility of obtaining\r\nartificially such pressures and temperatures as would fulfil the\r\nabove conditions. In their researches on the gases from fired\r\ngunpowder and cordite, Sir Frederick Abel and Sir Andrew Noble\r\nobtained in closed steel cylinders pressures as great as 95 tons\r\nto the square inch, and temperatures as high as 4000° C. According\r\nto a paper recently communicated to the Royal Society, Sir Andrew\r\nNoble, exploding cordite in closed vessels, has obtained a pressure\r\nof 8000 atmospheres, or 50 tons per square inch, with a temperature\r\nreaching in all probability 5400° Ab.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have conditions favourable for the liquefaction of\r\ncarbon, and were the time of explosion sufficient to allow the\r\nreactions to take place, we should certainly expect to get the\r\nliquid carbon to solidify in the crystalline state.[7]\r\n\r\nBy the kindness of Sir Andrew Noble I have been enabled to work\r\nupon some of the residues obtained in closed vessels after\r\nexplosions, and I have submitted them to the same treatment that\r\nthe granulated iron had gone through. After weeks of patient toil\r\nI removed the amorphous carbon, the graphite, the silica,[8] and\r\nother constituents of the ash of cordite, and obtained a residue\r\namong which, under the microscope, crystalline particles could be\r\ndistinguished. Some of these particles, from their crystalline\r\nappearance and double refraction, were silicon carbide; others\r\nwere probably diamonds. The whole residue was dried and fused at a\r\ngood red heat in an excess of potassium bifluoride, to which was\r\nadded, during fusion, 5 per cent of nitre. (Previous experiments\r\nhad shown me that this mixture readily attacked and dissolved\r\nsilicon carbide; unfortunately it also attacks diamond to a slight\r\ndegree.) All the operations of washing and acid treatment were\r\nperformed in a large platinum crucible by decantation (except the\r\npreliminary attack with nitric acid and potassium chlorate, when a\r\nhard glass vessel was used); the final result was washed into a\r\nshallow watch-glass and the selection made under the microscope.\r\nThe residue, after thorough washing and then heating in fuming\r\nsulphuric acid, was washed, and the largest crystalline particles\r\npicked out and mounted.\r\n\r\nFrom the treatment the residual crystals had undergone, chemists\r\nwill agree with me that diamonds only could stand such an ordeal;\r\non submitting them to skilled crystallographic authorities my\r\nopinion is confirmed. Speaking of the largest crystal, one eminent\r\nauthority calls it “a diamond showing octahedral planes with\r\ndark boundaries due to high refracting index.” After careful\r\nexamination, another authority writes of the same crystal diamond,\r\n“I think one may safely say that the position and angles of its\r\nfaces, and of its cleavages, the absence of birefringence, and the\r\nhigh refractive index are all compatible with the properties of the\r\ndiamond crystallising in the form of an octahedron. Others of the\r\nremaining crystals, which show a similar high refractive index,\r\nappeared to me to present the same features.”\r\n\r\nIt would have been more conclusive had I been able to get further\r\nevidence as to the density and hardness of the crystals; but from\r\nwhat I have already said I think there is no doubt that in these\r\nclosed vessel explosions we have another method of producing the\r\ndiamond artificially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL FORMATION OF THE DIAMOND\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hypothesis is of little value if it only elucidates half a\r\nproblem. Let us see how far we can follow out the ferric hypothesis\r\nto explain the volcanic pipes. In the first place we must remember\r\nthese so-called volcanic vents are admittedly not filled with the\r\neruptive rocks, scoriaceous fragments, etc., constituting the\r\nordinary contents of volcanic ducts.\r\n\r\nCertain artificial diamonds present the appearance of an elongated\r\ndrop. I have seen diamonds which have exactly the appearance of\r\ndrops of liquid separated in a pasty condition and crystallised\r\non cooling. Diamonds are sometimes found with little appearance\r\nof crystallisation, but with rounded forms similar to those\r\nwhich a liquid might assume if kept in the midst of another\r\nliquid with which it would not mix. Other drops of liquid carbon\r\nretained for sufficient time above their melting-point would\r\ncoalesce with adjacent drops, and on slow cooling would separate\r\nin the form of large perfect crystals. Two drops, joining after\r\nincipient crystallisation, might assume the not uncommon form of\r\ninterpenetrating twin crystals.\r\n\r\nMany circumstances point to the conclusion that the diamond of\r\nthe chemist and the diamond of the mine are strangely akin as to\r\norigin. It is evident that the diamond has not been formed _in\r\nsitu_ in the blue ground. The genesis must have taken place at vast\r\ndepths under enormous pressure. The explosion of large diamonds\r\non coming to the surface shows extreme tension. More diamonds are\r\nfound in fragments and splinters than in perfect crystals; and it\r\nis noteworthy that although these splinters and fragments must be\r\nderived from the breaking up of a large crystal, yet in only one\r\ninstance have pieces been found which could be fitted together, and\r\nthese occurred at different levels. Does not this fact point to the\r\nconclusion that the blue ground is not their true matrix? Nature\r\ndoes not make fragments of crystals. As the edges of the crystals\r\nare still sharp and unabraded, the _locus_ of formation cannot have\r\nbeen very distant from the present sites. There were probably many\r\nsites of crystallisation differing in place and time, or we should\r\nnot see such distinctive characters in the gems from different\r\nmines, nor indeed in the diamonds from different parts of the same\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nI start with the reasonable supposition that at a sufficient\r\ndepth[9] there were masses of molten iron at great pressure and\r\nhigh temperature, holding carbon in solution, ready to crystallise\r\nout on cooling. Far back in time the cooling from above caused\r\ncracks in superjacent strata through which water[10] found its way.\r\nOn reaching the incandescent iron the water would be converted\r\ninto gas, and this gas would rapidly disintegrate and erode the\r\nchannels through which it passed, grooving a passage more and more\r\nvertical in the necessity to find the quickest vent to the surface.\r\nBut steam in the presence of molten or even red-hot iron liberates\r\nlarge volumes of hydrogen gas, together with less quantities of\r\nhydrocarbons[11] of all kinds--liquid, gaseous, and solid. Erosion\r\ncommenced by steam would be continued by the other gases; it would\r\nbe easy for pipes, large as any found in South Africa, to be\r\nscored out in this manner.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Noble has shown that when the screw stopper of his\r\nsteel cylinders in which gunpowder explodes under pressure is not\r\nabsolutely perfect, gas escapes with a rush so overpowering and a\r\ntemperature so high as to score a wide channel in the metal. To\r\nillustrate my argument Sir Andrew Noble has been kind enough to try\r\na special experiment. Through a cylinder of granite he drilled a\r\nhole 0·2 inch diameter, the size of a small vent. This was made the\r\nstopper of an explosion chamber, in which a quantity of cordite was\r\nfired, the gases escaping through the granite vent. The pressure\r\nwas about 1500 atmospheres and the whole time of escape was less\r\nthan half a second. The erosion produced by the escaping gases and\r\nby the heat of friction scored out a channel more than half an\r\ninch diameter and melted the granite along the course. If steel\r\nand granite are thus vulnerable at comparatively moderate gaseous\r\npressure, it is easy to imagine the destructive upburst of hydrogen\r\nand water-gas, grooving for itself a channel in the diabase and\r\nquartzite, tearing fragments from resisting rocks, covering the\r\ncountry with debris, and finally, at the subsidence of the great\r\nrush, filling the self-made pipe with a water-borne magma in which\r\nrocks, minerals, iron oxide, shale, petroleum, and diamonds are\r\nviolently churned in a veritable witch’s cauldron! As the heat\r\nabated the water vapour would gradually give place to hot water,\r\nwhich, forced through the magma, would change some of the mineral\r\nfragments into the existing forms of to-day.\r\n\r\nEach outbreak would form a dome-shaped hill; the eroding agency of\r\nwater and ice would plane these eminences until all traces of the\r\noriginal pipes were lost.\r\n\r\nActions such as I have described need not have taken place\r\nsimultaneously. As there must have been many molten masses\r\nof iron with variable contents of carbon, different kinds of\r\ncolouring matter, solidifying with varying degrees of rapidity,\r\nand coming in contact with water at intervals throughout long\r\nperiods of geological time--so must there have been many outbursts\r\nand upheavals, giving rise to pipes containing diamonds. And\r\nthese diamonds, by sparseness of distribution, crystalline\r\ncharacter, difference of tint, purity of colour, varying hardness,\r\nbrittleness, and state of tension, have the story of their origin\r\nimpressed upon them, engraved by natural forces--a story which\r\nfuture generations of scientific men may be able to interpret with\r\ngreater precision than is possible to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMETEORIC DIAMONDS\r\n\r\n\r\nSensational as is the story of the diamond industry in South\r\nAfrica, quite another aspect fixes the attention of the chemist.\r\nThe diamonds come out of the mines, but how did they get in? How\r\nwere they formed? What is their origin?\r\n\r\nGardner Williams, who knows more about diamonds than any man\r\nliving, is little inclined to indulge in speculation. In his\r\nfascinating book he frankly says:\r\n\r\n“I have been frequently asked, ‘What is your theory of the original\r\ncrystallisation of the diamond?’ and the answer has always been, ‘I\r\nhave none; for after seventeen years of thoughtful study, coupled\r\nwith practical research, I find that it is easier to “drive a coach\r\nand four” through most theories that have been propounded than to\r\nsuggest one which would be based on any non-assailable data.’\r\nAll that can be said is that in some unknown manner carbon, which\r\nexisted deep down in the internal regions of the earth, was changed\r\nfrom its black and uninviting appearance to the most beautiful gem\r\nwhich ever saw the light of day.”\r\n\r\nAnother diamond theory appeals to the imagination. It is said\r\nthe diamond is a gift from Heaven, conveyed to earth in meteoric\r\nshowers. The suggestion, I believe, was first broached by A.\r\nMeydenbauer,[12] who says, “The diamond can only be of cosmic\r\norigin, having fallen as a meteorite at later periods of the\r\nearth’s formation. The available localities of the diamond contain\r\nthe residues of not very compact meteoric masses which may,\r\nperhaps, have fallen in prehistoric ages, and which have penetrated\r\nmore or less deeply, according to the more or less resistant\r\ncharacter of the surface where they fell. Their remains are\r\ncrumbling away on exposure to the air and sun, and the rain has\r\nlong ago washed away all prominent masses. The enclosed diamonds\r\nhave remained scattered in the river beds, while the fine light\r\nmatrix has been swept away.”\r\n\r\nAccording to this hypothesis, the so-called volcanic pipes are\r\nsimply holes bored in the solid earth by the impact of monstrous\r\nmeteors--the larger masses boring the holes, while the smaller\r\nmasses, disintegrating in their fall, distributed diamonds\r\nbroadcast. Bizarre as such a theory appears, I am bound to say\r\nthere are many circumstances which show that the notion of the\r\nheavens raining diamonds is not impossible.\r\n\r\nThe most striking confirmation of the meteoric theory comes from\r\nArizona. Here, on a broad open plain, over an area about five\r\nmiles in diameter, have been scattered one or two thousand masses\r\nof metallic iron, the fragments varying in weight from half a ton\r\nto a fraction of an ounce. There is no doubt these masses formed\r\npart of a meteoric shower, although no record exists as to when\r\nthe fall took place. Curiously enough, near the centre, where most\r\nof the meteorites have been found, is a crater with raised edges\r\nthree-quarters of a mile in diameter and about 600 feet deep,\r\nbearing exactly the appearance which would be produced had a mighty\r\nmass of iron struck the ground and buried itself deep under the\r\nsurface. Altogether, ten tons of this iron have been collected, and\r\nspecimens of the Canyon Diablo meteorite are in most collectors’\r\ncabinets.\r\n\r\nAn ardent mineralogist--the late Dr. Foote--cutting a section of\r\nthis meteorite, found the tools were injured by something vastly\r\nharder than metallic iron. He examined the specimen chemically,\r\nand soon after announced to the scientific world that the Canyon\r\nDiablo meteorite contained black and transparent diamonds. This\r\nstartling discovery was afterwards verified by Professors Moissan\r\nand Friedel, and Moissan, working on 183 kilogrammes of the Canyon\r\nDiablo meteorite, has recently found smooth black diamonds and\r\ntransparent diamonds in the form of octahedra with rounded edges,\r\ntogether with green, hexagonal crystals of carbon silicide. The\r\npresence of carbon silicide in the meteorite shows that it must at\r\nsome time have experienced the temperature of the electric furnace.\r\nSince this revelation the search for diamonds in meteorites has\r\noccupied the attention of chemists all over the world.\r\n\r\nFig. 23 A, C, and D, are reproductions of photographs of true\r\ndiamonds I myself have extracted from the Canyon Diablo meteorite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. DIAMONDS FROM CANYON DIABLO METEORITE.\r\n\r\n  To face p. 138.]\r\n\r\nUnder atmospheric influences the iron would rapidly oxidise and\r\nrust away, colouring the adjacent soil with red oxide of iron.\r\nThe meteoric diamonds would be unaffected and left on the surface\r\nof the soil, to be found haphazard when oxidation had removed the\r\nlast proof of their celestial origin. That there are still lumps of\r\niron left at Arizona is merely due to the extreme dryness of the\r\nclimate and the comparatively short time that the iron has been on\r\nour planet. We are here witnesses to the course of an event which\r\nmay have happened in geologic times anywhere on the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nAlthough in Arizona diamonds have fallen from the skies,\r\nconfounding our senses, this descent of precious stones is what may\r\nbe called a freak of nature rather than a normal occurrence. To\r\nthe modern student of science there is no great difference between\r\nthe composition of our earth and that of extra-terrestrial masses.\r\nThe mineral peridot is a constant extra-terrestrial visitor,\r\npresent in most meteorites. And yet no one doubts that peridot\r\nis also a true constituent of rocks formed on this earth. The\r\nspectroscope reveals that the elementary composition of the stars\r\nand the earth are pretty much the same; and the spectroscope also\r\nshows that meteorites have as much of earth as of heaven in their\r\ncomposition. Indeed, not only are the selfsame elements present in\r\nmeteorites, but they are combined in the same way to form the same\r\nminerals as in the crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is certain from observations I have made, corroborated\r\nby experience gained in the laboratory, that iron at a high\r\ntemperature and under great pressure--conditions existent at great\r\ndepths below the surface of the earth--acts as the long-sought\r\nsolvent for carbon, and will allow it to crystallise out in the\r\nform of diamond. But it is also certain, from the evidence afforded\r\nby the Arizona and other meteorites, that similar conditions have\r\nexisted among bodies in space, and that on more than one occasion a\r\nmeteorite freighted with jewels has fallen as a star from the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Able, Sir F., closed vessel experiments, 122\r\n\r\n  Absorption spectrum of diamond, 101\r\n\r\n  Aliwal North, 6\r\n\r\n  Alluvial deposits of diamonds, 9\r\n\r\n  Amygdaloidal trap, 10\r\n\r\n  Arizona meteor, 136\r\n\r\n  Arkansas, diamonds in, 2\r\n\r\n  Ash of diamond, 82, 89\r\n\r\n  Augite, 20\r\n\r\n  Automatic diamond collector, 56\r\n\r\n\r\n  Barytes, 71\r\n  -- density of, 93\r\n\r\n  Basalt, 15\r\n\r\n  Basutos, 12, 39\r\n\r\n  Bechuanas, 12, 39\r\n\r\n  Beryl, density of, 93\r\n  -- refractive index of, 103\r\n\r\n  Biotite, 20\r\n\r\n  Blackening of diamonds, 98\r\n\r\n  Blue ground, 10, 47\r\n  -- -- diamantiferous, 18, 19\r\n\r\n  Boart, 81,\r\n  -- combustion temperature of, 90\r\n  -- density of, 93\r\n\r\n  Boiling-point of carbon, 110\r\n\r\n  Bonney, Rev.

BRENDON AND SON, LTD., PRINTERS, PLYMOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Chemical News_, Vol. I, p. 208.\r\n\r\n[2] Mr. Paterson called “limey stuff” what is now termed “blue\r\nground.” It was also formerly called “marl stuff,” “blue stuff,”\r\nand “blue clay.”\r\n\r\n[3] The original name for the Kimberley Mine. It was also sometimes\r\nknown as “Colesberg Kopje.”\r\n\r\n[4] _Diamonds and Gold in South Africa._ By T. Reunert.\r\nJohannesburg, 1893.\r\n\r\n[5] According to Gardner Williams the South African carat is\r\nequivalent to 3·174 grains. In Latimer Clark’s _Dictionary of\r\nMetric and other Useful Measures_ the diamond carat is given as\r\nequal to 3·1683 grains = 0·2053 gramme = 4 diamond grains; 1\r\ndiamond grain = 0·792 troy grain; 151·5 diamond carats = 1 ounce\r\ntroy.\r\n\r\nWebster’s _International Dictionary_ gives the diamond carat as\r\nequal to 3⅕ troy grains.\r\n\r\n_The Oxford English Dictionary_ says the carat was originally 1/144\r\nof an ounce, or 3⅓ grains, but now equal to about 3⅕ grains, though\r\nvarying slightly with time and place.\r\n\r\nThe _Century Dictionary_ says the diamond carat is equal to about\r\n3⅙ troy grains, and adds that in 1877 the weight of the carat was\r\nfixed by a syndicate of London, Paris, and Amsterdam jewellers at\r\n205 milligrammes. This would make the carat equal to 3·163 troy\r\ngrains. A law has been passed in France ordaining that in the\r\npurchase or sale of diamonds and other precious stones the term\r\n“metric carat” shall be employed to designate a weight of 200\r\nmilligrammes (3·086 grains troy), and prohibiting the use of the\r\nword carat to designate any other weight.\r\n\r\n[6] Artificial tribo-luminescent sphalerite:--\r\n\r\n  Zinc carbonate      100 parts\r\n  Flower of sulphur    30   ”\r\n  Manganese sulphate    ½ per cent.\r\n\r\nMix with distilled water and dry at a gentle heat. Put in luted\r\ncrucible and keep at a bright red heat for from two to three hours.\r\n\r\n[7] Sir James Dewar, in a Friday evening discourse at the Royal\r\nInstitution in 1880, showed an experiment proving that the\r\ntemperature of the interior of a carbon tube heated by an outside\r\nelectric arc was higher than that of the oxy-hydrogen flame. He\r\nplaced a few small crystals of diamond in the carbon tube, and,\r\nmaintaining a current of hydrogen to prevent oxidation, raised the\r\ntemperature of the tube in an electric furnace to that of the arc.\r\nIn a few minutes the diamond was transformed into graphite. At\r\nfirst sight this would seem to show that diamond cannot be formed\r\nat temperatures above that of the arc. It is probable, however, for\r\nreasons given above, that at exceedingly high pressures the result\r\nwould be different.\r\n\r\n[8] The silica was in the form of spheres, perfectly shaped and\r\ntransparent, mostly colourless, but among them several of a ruby\r\ncolour. When 5 per cent of silica was added to cordite, the residue\r\nof the closed vessel explosion contained a much larger quantity of\r\nthese spheres.\r\n\r\n[9] A pressure of fifteen tons on the square inch would exist not\r\nmany miles beneath the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\n[10] There are abundant signs that a considerable portion of this\r\npart of Africa was once under water, and a fresh-water shell has\r\nbeen found in apparently undisturbed blue ground at Kimberley.\r\n\r\n[11] The water sunk in wells close to the Kimberley mine is\r\nsometimes impregnated with paraffin, and Sir H. Roscoe extracted a\r\nsolid hydrocarbon from the “blue ground.”\r\n\r\n[12] _Chemical News_, vol. lxi, p. 209, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within\r\n  the text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  All misspellings in the text, and inconsistent or archaic usage,\r\n  have been retained: for example, unfrequent; clayey; friable;\r\n  slaty; imbed; stoped; peculation; situate.\r\n\r\n  In the Table of Contents, the Index page number ‘145’ has been\r\n  replaced by ‘141’.\r\n\r\n  In the Index, ‘Colesberg Copje’ has been replaced by\r\n  ‘Colesberg Kopje’, and ‘DeBeers’ has been replaced by\r\n  ‘De Beers’.",
