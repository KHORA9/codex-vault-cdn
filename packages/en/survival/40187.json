These three events were, first, the\r\ndeaths of Humboldt and Ritter, two great geographical pioneers who hewed\r\ntracks through the tangled jungle of unsystematised geographical facts,\r\nand second, the publication of the _Origin of Species_, by Charles\r\nDarwin, a book which supplied the compass which has made further\r\nroad-making in that same jungle possible. In other words, as a result of\r\nthe life-work of the two great geographers named, and of the throwing by\r\nCharles Darwin of a new ferment into the mass of contemporary thought,\r\nwhat had been a mere collection of facts began to be a reasoned and\r\nordered science. Both Humboldt and Ritter lived to a great age, so that\r\nat the time of their deaths not only was their work done, but there had\r\nbeen time also for their influence to permeate the literature of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nHumboldt was, above all, a great traveller, but he was also a man of\r\nscience in the largest sense, interested not in one group of facts, but\r\nin many. The extent of his knowledge and the breadth of his interests\r\nenabled him to observe a vast number of phenomena while his particular\r\ngenius was manifest in the way in which he correlated these, and\r\nconsidered them in their relation to each other. Though it is true that\r\nhis influence was most direct in the case of natural history, yet in\r\nthis respect also he pointed to the future, for the geographers of\r\nto-day are indebted to the naturalists for some of their finest\r\ngeneralisations.\r\n\r\nRitter was a great teacher, the prototype of those who alike by their\r\npersonal influence and by their books have enriched geographical science\r\nwithin the last fifty years. He had not Humboldt's breadth of knowledge\r\nand interest, but in the stress which he laid upon the earth as above\r\nall interesting in that it is the field of the activity of man, he\r\nemphasised an aspect of the subject in which perhaps the most\r\ninteresting modern developments have taken place.\r\n\r\nDarwin had a twofold effect upon the progress of geography. In the first\r\nplace, in his detailed work, _e. g._ in connection with coral reefs, and\r\nwith the distribution of animals, and less directly in his investigation\r\nof the part played by earthworms in the formation of soil, he himself\r\nadded to geographical knowledge. But he did much more than this. The\r\ndoctrine of evolution which he made common property has had and is\r\nhaving an enormous effect upon geographical science, both directly and\r\nindirectly.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, in connection with his own theory of the cause of\r\nevolution, Darwin laid great stress upon the \"Struggle for Existence.\"\r\nBut he himself expressly stated that he used the term in a \"large and\r\nmetaphorical sense,\" a sense which in popular language it has tended to\r\nlose. From the geographer's standpoint, therefore, it is better to say\r\nthat Darwin's work has added a new interest to the study of\r\ninterrelations. Humboldt, as we have indicated, was greatly interested\r\nin such subjects as the connection between the climate of a region and\r\nthe vegetation, between the activities of man in a particular region and\r\nthe physical conditions, and so on. But Darwin added a new interest to\r\nsuch studies. For example, it is a curious fact that desert plants have\r\noften spiny leaves, long roots, and so forth, and it is interesting to\r\nnote how these peculiarities fit the plants for life in an arid climate.\r\nBut when Darwin showed that there was evidence that the physical\r\nconditions of the desert gave rise to certain types of vegetation, it\r\nbecame worth while to study both the physical conditions and the\r\ncharacters of the plants in much greater detail than before.\r\n\r\nIf we simply lay it down as an axiom that, _e. g._ cactuses live in\r\ndeserts, the fact has only a moderate interest, but when we find that\r\nalmost any natural group of plants, if exposed through long ages to\r\ngradually increasing conditions of drought, will produce \"cactus\" types,\r\nthen the whole subject acquires new importance. This illustration may\r\nserve to suggest what Darwin has done for geography.\r\n\r\nHe showed that there is a delicately adjusted balance between organisms\r\nand their surroundings, taken in their widest sense. But geology proves\r\nthat through the ages there have been constant, if slight, changes in\r\nthe physical conditions, and the effort of the organisms to readjust the\r\nbalance thus disturbed has led to evolution. Thus to some extent at\r\nleast the characters of organisms can be explained by the nature of\r\ntheir surroundings. A further interest is added by the fact that in this\r\nrespect human societies and settlements can be shown to behave like\r\norganisms. Therefore we can hope to explain at least partially the\r\nmanifold differences in man and his societies in different parts of the\r\nglobe by the minor differences in physical conditions. In other words,\r\nthe doctrine of evolution has added a unifying and co-ordinating\r\nprinciple which has not only prevented geography from being crushed by\r\nthe enormous recent increase in known facts, but has also for the first\r\ntime raised it to the level of a science.\r\n\r\nThis addition of a co-ordinating principle may be said to be the direct\r\neffect of the publication of the _Origin of Species_, but there has been\r\nan indirect effect almost as important. The principles enunciated in\r\nthat book had a stimulating effect, not upon one science only but upon\r\nevery department of thought. Phenomena of no importance suddenly became\r\ninteresting, and the result of this interest was an enormous addition to\r\nknown facts. Not only has research been stimulated in every direction,\r\nbut as this research has been largely directed by the desire to discover\r\nthe interrelation of phenomena, we find that many of the old barriers\r\nbetween the sciences are breaking down.\r\n\r\nThe botanists are no longer content to study the facts of plant\r\ndistribution; they now want to be able to give reasons for particular\r\ndistributions. Therefore they must seek the aid of the meteorologists to\r\nexplain differences of climate; of the physical geographer to make clear\r\nthe effects of relief, of differences of soil, and of drainage; of the\r\ncartographer to represent the facts which emerge from their surveys, and\r\nso on. The physician must now seek the assistance of the zoologist\r\nbefore he can deal adequately with tropical disease, and the zoologist\r\nmust have the help of the physical geographer before he can give\r\nadequate aid. The result is that in all directions geography is being\r\nenriched by facts brought from the collateral sciences, while at the\r\nsame time its position as a central unifying science is becoming more\r\nand more established; as a science which can deal with all these varied\r\nfacts, but deal with them from a standpoint peculiarly its own.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, geography may be compared to one of Rodin's statues\r\nin which we see a beautiful figure as it were struggling to escape from\r\nthe marble in which it is imprisoned. So the geography of to-day is in\r\nthe act of escaping from the matrix of mere facts in which it has been\r\ntoo long imprisoned. It is now displaying itself as a great unity in the\r\nmaking of which all the sciences have played their part.\r\n\r\nBut even in this general survey of recent developments two other sets of\r\nfacts must be touched upon. We have given fifty years as the period\r\nwithin which most of what is distinctively modern in geography has\r\ndeveloped. It must not be forgotten that within the same period there\r\nhas been a remarkable renewal of interest in geographical exploration.\r\nRoughly speaking, within this period Africa has ceased to be an unknown\r\ncontinent; the innermost recesses of Asia have been largely explored;\r\nthe Arctic and Antarctic areas have yielded many, though by no means the\r\nwhole, of their secrets; a great deal of exploration has been done in\r\nAmerica as a whole, as well as much detailed survey work in the United\r\nStates and Canada; the oceans have been investigated by successive\r\nseries of expeditions. Generally it may be said that in its broad\r\noutlines our knowledge of the world has been completed, so that\r\ngeographical science is free to pass from the mere collection of raw\r\nmaterial to the higher task of arranging, classifying, and making\r\ndeductions, as well as to the more detailed surveys which are still\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe other point of interest is that the last fifty years have seen an\r\nenormous increase in the facilities for travel, a fact which has led to\r\na great increase in the number of people to whom geography appeals. The\r\ndecade between 1830 and 1840 saw the beginning of two great series of\r\nguide-books, Murray's _Handbooks_ and Baedeker's _Guides_, whose\r\nimportance for the travelling public can hardly be over-estimated. The\r\nfirst \"Baedeker\" was a little guide to the Rhine, and since it was first\r\npublished this firm of publishers has not only extended its field of\r\noperations over nearly the whole world, but has issued a constant stream\r\nof new editions, which for the most frequented tourist regions are\r\npractically annual. That great tourist agency whose name is now a\r\nhousehold word began operations in the early forties, and like the firm\r\nof Baedeker has now taken the world as its sphere of action. We may say,\r\nthen, that during the course of the nineteenth century, travel,\r\npreviously a pastime of the rich, was brought within the reach of very\r\nmoderate purses. This democratisation of travel is still going on, and\r\nin certain recent visits of British working men to Germany and elsewhere\r\nwe may perhaps see the beginning of a process which will eventually\r\nbring some amount of journeying abroad within the reach of all.\r\n\r\nAs yet the effect upon geography of this increase in travelling has been\r\nchiefly to enhance popular interest in the science, rather than to\r\nenrich it, for the vast majority of \"popular\" travel books have added\r\nlittle, if anything, to the sum total of knowledge. But this is partly\r\nbecause geographical teaching has hitherto been badly organised, and the\r\ngreater number of travellers have started on their journeys without\r\nhaving been taught what to observe or how to observe. There are already\r\nindications that this condition of affairs is passing away, and that the\r\ntraveller of the future will start better equipped, and will demand in\r\nhis guide-books a new point of view. Starting from a higher level he\r\nwill bring back more from his travels.\r\n\r\nMeantime it should be noted that some knowledge of the generalisations\r\nlaid down by geographers during the course of the last half century adds\r\nenormously to the interest of travel, both at home and abroad, and that\r\nfor this reason, if for no other, geography is worth study by all.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters we shall look, so far as possible, at those\r\naspects of the subject which make the widest appeal, and which are best\r\nfitted to enable the ordinary man to understand his surroundings,\r\nwhatever they may be, and so aid him in that delicate task of adjustment\r\nwhich, consciously or unconsciously, is the task of every living thing.\r\nAs limitations of space involve a similar limitation of subject-matter,\r\nit has been thought best to lay most stress upon the conditions which\r\nprevail in Europe and North America, the areas which have been most\r\nthoroughly studied. Europe has the special interest that it has given\r\norigin to the type of civilisation which has most profoundly modified\r\nthe earth's surface. This limitation cannot, however, be made rigid, for\r\nit is of the essence of the modern standpoint that no area can be\r\nunderstood without reference to the world at large. The geography of\r\nEurope no less than of North America is determined by the position of\r\nthe respective continents on the surface of the globe, and cannot be\r\nunderstood without a consideration of this position and its\r\nimplications. The standpoint adopted here is frankly anthropological,\r\nthat is, the world is considered as the home of man, its physical\r\npeculiarities being regarded as interesting chiefly in their relation to\r\nman and his activities.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may note that the development of the subject within recent\r\nyears has been such that it is quite impossible, even within the\r\nlimitations already laid down, to give a complete survey of the subject.\r\nAll that will be attempted, therefore, is to suggest some of the lines\r\nalong which research is proceeding most actively at the present time,\r\nspecial stress being laid upon those aspects of the subject which are\r\nnot as yet fully treated in the smaller text-books. The list of books of\r\nreference at the end will, it is hoped, enable those interested to fill\r\nin the blanks which such a scheme necessarily leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSURFACE-RELIEF AND THE PROCESS OF EROSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to consider the various formal definitions of\r\ngeography which have been proposed in the last few years. As is only\r\nnatural with a developing subject, much discussion has taken place as to\r\nthe exact limits of its field of action, and many definitions have been\r\nproposed with the object of setting forth these limits as clearly as\r\npossible. But it is sufficient for our purpose to note that geography\r\ndeals with the surface-relief of the earth, and with the influence which\r\nthat relief exercises upon the distribution of other phenomena, and\r\nespecially upon the life of man. Before we proceed to study detailed\r\nproblems, then, it is obviously necessary to look at some general points\r\nconnected with the relief of the earth's surface and its causes.\r\n\r\nIn the words of the physical geographer, the earth's surface consists\r\nof the solid crust, or lithosphere, of the mass of water forming the\r\nseas and oceans and constituting the hydrosphere, and of that envelope\r\nof gas which we call the atmosphere. Considered separately, each of\r\nthese is the concern of special sciences, and not of the geographer\r\nproper. His business it is to take the facts furnished by the\r\nmeteorologists, the physicists, the geologists, and so forth, and with\r\nthese facts in hand to proceed to consider the effect of the interaction\r\nof earth and water and air in a way which the separate sciences cannot\r\ndo. We must further note that it is the interactions of these three\r\nwhich make the earth a possible home for life as we know it, and it is\r\nthese interactions therefore which influence the distribution of life on\r\nthe surface of the globe.\r\n\r\nThere may have been a period when the crust of the earth was clothed in\r\na uniform sheet of water, just as the globe is now enveloped in a\r\ncomplete covering of air, but at present, as through the long ages of\r\ngeological time, the lithosphere consists of elevations and hollows, and\r\nit is in the hollows that the water accumulates, so that we can\r\ndistinguish between the dry land and the ocean beds. Both chemically\r\nand physically the fluid hydrosphere differs markedly from the solid\r\nlithosphere, and it is, above all, the physical differences which are of\r\nsupreme importance to the geographer. Because of them sea and land\r\nrespond differently to the stream of solar energy which pours down upon\r\nour globe, and it is this different response which is the predominating\r\nfactor in the production of the different climates, which again\r\ndetermine in its main outlines the distribution of living organisms.\r\n\r\nThis being so, it is clear that it is of great importance to the\r\ngeographer to know exactly the distribution of land and water over the\r\nsurface of the earth. As the North Polar regions are still inadequately\r\nknown, and the South Polar regions hardly known at all, we cannot as yet\r\ndetermine exactly this distribution, but any globe will show that land\r\nand ocean are very unequally distributed. The great land masses cluster\r\nround the North Pole, while the southern hemisphere consists largely of\r\nwater. We thus have a land hemisphere and a water one. According to\r\nrecent calculations the oceans occupy some 72 per cent. of the entire\r\nsurface of the globe, leaving only 28 per cent. of land. But while in\r\nthe northern hemisphere there is about one and a half times more water\r\nthan land, in the southern there is about six times more water, both\r\nfigures being liable to error, as indicated above, owing to our\r\nuncertainty as to the land and water of the Polar zones.\r\n\r\nThis distribution is of great importance in connection with certain\r\ntheories as to the actual plan of the earth, but this is a difficult\r\nsubject which need not concern us here. It is discussed in Prof. J. W.\r\nGregory's volume on _The Making of the Earth_. More interesting is the\r\neffect which the arrangement of land and water has had upon that part of\r\nthe life of the earth which was evolved in late geological time. Though\r\nthe geographer for convenience' sake recognizes three separate\r\ncontinents in the Old World--Europe, Asia and Africa--yet these form\r\npractically one land mass, which in its turn approaches America very\r\nnearly at Bering Straits, and, less nearly, in the North Atlantic\r\nthrough the intervention of the British Isles, the Faeroes, Iceland,\r\nGreenland, etc. The centre of this land mass lies in Europe, a point not\r\nwithout its importance.\r\n\r\nIn this great land mass of the northern hemisphere life has reached its\r\nhighest degree of development, both as regards animal form and as\r\nregards human societies. It was in the northern hemisphere that the\r\nhighest mammals, the placentals, arose. There are many remarkable\r\nresemblances between the faunas of Europe, of Asia and of Africa, and a\r\nsimilar, if less marked, resemblance between those of North America on\r\nthe one hand and of Europe and temperate Asia on the other. On the other\r\nhand, the two great land masses which occur in the southern hemisphere,\r\nSouth America and Australia, show very marked differences in their\r\nfauna, both from each other and from the northern land masses, and in\r\nboth cases the fauna has a primitive aspect, which is best marked in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to consider man, somewhat similar conditions present\r\nthemselves. The great civilisations developed in the land mass of the\r\nOld World, though the waterless desert of the Sahara cut off much of\r\nAfrica from participation in them. America developed a relatively high\r\ncivilisation of its own, but as the icefields and ice-pack of the north\r\nformed a greater barrier to the migrations of man than to those of the\r\nnorthern animals, this American civilisation was for long cut off from\r\nthat of the Old World, and when free communication became possible, it\r\nwent down before that of the eastern world.\r\n\r\nWe must connect these facts directly with the peculiar distribution of\r\nland and water in the northern hemisphere, which made free intercourse\r\npossible, alike for the land animals and for man. The importance of this\r\nintercourse may be suggested in a few words. When a group of organisms\r\nis limited, from whatever cause, to a particular zone of the earth's\r\nsurface, the members of the group tend to acquire characters fitting\r\nthem for this restricted area. But if the area is open, constantly or\r\nperiodically, to incursions of organisms from adjacent areas, then, with\r\nthe widening of the environment, and the greater intensity of the\r\nstruggle for existence, evolution is quickened and new characters\r\nappear. The men of the Eurasian continent learnt, on the fierce\r\nbattle-grounds of that continent, lessons which enabled them to conquer\r\nwithout difficulty the more isolated human groups of the southern\r\nhemisphere. The fact that they took south with them the mammals of the\r\nnorth, who also have thriven at the expense of the native forms, shows\r\nthat the hold of the southern animals upon their habitat was no less\r\nprecarious than that of man himself.\r\n\r\nOne other point is worth notice in connection with the distribution of\r\nland and water over the surface of the globe. We have seen that the\r\nnorthern hemisphere is the region where organic evolution has been most\r\nmarked. It is, as it were, a great biological laboratory. On the other\r\nhand, in the southern hemisphere, which has fewer land masses to\r\ninterfere with the circulation of the atmosphere, many physical\r\nphenomena occur in a more marked and orderly fashion than to the north.\r\nThe westerly winds of the south blow with a force and a constancy which\r\nmakes it impossible to compare them with the more variable westerlies of\r\nthe north. Even the ocean currents of the south seem to show more\r\nconstancy than those of the north. If the northern hemisphere is a great\r\nbiological laboratory, the southern may be described as a physical one,\r\nand one of the great interests of the further exploration of the\r\nAntarctic is that it will probably cast light upon some important\r\nmeteorological problems. (See Dr. W. S. Bruce's volume on _Polar\r\nExploration_.)\r\n\r\nThe distribution of land and water, with all its effects on climate and\r\non the distribution of life, is, as we have seen, caused by the main\r\nfeatures of the relief of the earth, by the existence of vast\r\ndepressions in which the water accumulates, and of relative elevations\r\nfrom which it flows. But the minor details of relief, hill and valley,\r\nocean depth and continental shelf, are also important, and exercise a\r\nvery marked effect upon distribution. They therefore demand in their\r\nturn some consideration.\r\n\r\nTaking first the prime distinction between land surface and ocean floor,\r\nwe note that the two differ from one another markedly, alike in their\r\ncharacteristics and in the conditions to which they are exposed. The\r\nland is subjected to constantly varying conditions: to the alternation\r\nof day and night, and to the changes of the seasons, with corresponding\r\nvariations in temperature; to the fluctuations of the weather; to\r\nrunning water, and so forth. In the great ocean depths at least, on the\r\nother hand, the conditions are remarkably uniform. Neither diurnal nor\r\nseasonal changes have here any effect; the temperature seems to\r\nfluctuate but little; the water is almost still. This uniformity of\r\nphysical conditions is reflected in the uniformity of the surface over\r\nwide areas. While the land surface shows marked irregularities, the\r\nocean floor has a monotonous character, with more gentle outlines.\r\n\r\nIn its most general form the characters of the sea bottom may be briefly\r\nstated. Round the great land masses there is an area of relatively\r\nshallow water, which is sometimes only a few miles wide, and at other\r\ntimes extends outwards for hundreds of miles. This region is the\r\n_Continental Shelf_, and its seaward boundary for convenience' sake is\r\ntaken at a depth of 100 fathoms, or 600 feet. Within this zone the\r\ninfluence of the land is still felt, and some of the characters of land\r\nsurfaces appear. Thus we sometimes find that river valleys are prolonged\r\noutwards over the Continental Shelf, giving a markedly irregular\r\nappearance to the ocean floor. The British Islands lie upon a\r\nContinental Shelf of this kind, and this is one of our reasons for\r\nknowing that they are really only a part of the continent of Europe,\r\nseparated from it by a slight depression.\r\n\r\nThe Continental Shelf slopes away from the land gently, and is widest\r\nwhere it fringes low continents, and narrowest where mountains approach\r\nthe coast. Over it is spread the waste of the land, the coarser lying\r\nnear the shore-line, the finer extending outwards to the steep seaward\r\nslope. This rapid slope leads down to the more or less uniform ocean\r\nplateau, whose surface is broken by the great ocean abysses, the\r\ngreatest of which has a depth of about six miles. Relative but not\r\nabsolute uniformity thus characterises all that part of the ocean floor\r\nwhich lies below about 100 fathoms.\r\n\r\nAgain, though the ocean floor is doubtless being slowly raised by the\r\ndeposition upon it of the oceanic oozes, yet it is also true that as\r\ncompared with the land surface it displays great constancy. While the\r\nland surface is constantly changing owing to the varying forces which\r\nact upon it, the floor of the ocean can vary but little from age to age,\r\nunless it is acted upon by the internal forces of the earth.\r\n\r\nTurn now to the land. We note at once the two characters of marked\r\nirregularity of surface, and of changeableness. The changeableness is\r\ndue to the forces of erosion which act upon the surface, and of these\r\nforces the most important to the geographer is running water. It is\r\nrunning water, aided by other agents, which carves the land into hill\r\nand valley, which produces gorge and lake, only ultimately to fill up\r\nthe lake and plane away the gorge. It is running water which spreads out\r\non the lower ground the waste of the higher, and thus prepares the way\r\nfor the operations of man.\r\n\r\nThe result of the long-continued action of the varied forces of erosion\r\nmust necessarily be to reduce the surface to an almost level condition.\r\nThe denuding agents first produce irregularities and then finally remove\r\nthese, until the whole surface is once again almost level. The whole\r\nglobe would thus be reduced to the condition of a plain were it not for\r\nthe intervention of the internal forces which raise up the surface anew\r\ninto folds, or which produce volcanoes and outbursts of molten rock.\r\n\r\nThis constantly repeated series of changes may be said to be chiefly the\r\nconcern of the geologist, especially as it is a series which has\r\nrepeated itself in all time. But it is to be noted that at various parts\r\nof the surface of the globe at the present time every stage in the\r\nprocess occurs, and everywhere the question whether a particular land\r\narea has been exposed for a relatively long or for a relatively short\r\nperiod to the forces of erosion, has a profound influence upon life. It\r\nis therefore important for the geographer to be able to recognise the\r\ndifferent stages. This he cannot hope to do without some detailed\r\nknowledge of the effects of erosion.\r\n\r\nTheoretically every land surface elevated above sea-level should pass\r\nthrough what has been called a cycle of erosion. There should be a\r\nperiod when the active forces are working upon a surface as yet but\r\nlittle modified; this is the period called by analogy youth. At a later\r\nstage the drainage has been well established, and the rivers run in\r\nbroad valleys, from which lakes and waterfalls have largely disappeared.\r\nTo this condition the term mature has been applied. At a still later\r\nstage the land surface has been so worn by the eroding forces that the\r\nwhole process of erosion is slackened, and an uplift must occur before\r\nthe erosive forces regain their lost strength. This is the so-called\r\n\"cycle of normal erosion,\" but it is constantly liable to variations due\r\nto local crust movements, to changes in climate, and to local\r\nconditions, though at the same time the distinction of the various\r\nstages has value for the geographer because of their varying effects\r\nupon human life. It is necessary for us, therefore, to consider how the\r\ndifferent stages may be recognized, and how the forces of erosion act.\r\n\r\nLet us begin our study of erosion by a general survey of the striking\r\nfeatures of the earth's surface at the present day. We know that at\r\nvarious parts of the surface there rise lofty mountain chains, whose\r\nsummits are often permanently snow-clad, and which, from the sharpness\r\nof their forms and from the masses of rock rubbish which are\r\naccumulating round them, have obviously only been exposed for a\r\ngeologically short period to the action of the atmosphere and of running\r\nwater. When examined such mountain chains are all found to have the same\r\npeculiarities of internal form, the rocks composing them being\r\nelaborately folded and fractured. Careful investigation has convinced\r\ngeologists that all the existing great chains owe their origin to a\r\nseries of earth movements which occurred in the period called Tertiary,\r\nthat is, in the third of the great geological periods, the one\r\nimmediately preceding that in which we live.\r\n\r\nThese lofty mountain chains of Tertiary origin are most familiar in the\r\ngreat series of folds which appear at the surface to form the Pyrenees,\r\nthe Alps, the Caucasus and the Himalayas, but the Atlas Mountains belong\r\nto the same series, as does also that great mountain chain which, under\r\nvarious names, runs down the western coast of the American continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--The main points in regard to the structure of\r\nEurope. The shaded areas (1) are regions of ancient rocks, much folded\r\nand crumpled, which once formed mountain regions but are now mostly worn\r\ndown to uplands. The lines (2) show the regions affected by Tertiary\r\nfolding, largely occupied by mountain chains. The unshaded areas are\r\nmostly plains and basins, only slightly affected by folding, and made up\r\nof rocks which are often almost horizontal.]\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, these areas are recognised not only by the fact\r\nthat there appear at the surface a great number of peaks forming a\r\nmountain chain, but also by the internal structure, the\r\ncharacteristically complex folding of the rocks. Now outside of these\r\nrecently elevated areas in, for example, the continent of Europe, we\r\nfind two conditions. On the one hand, there are regions of upland type\r\nbut with rounded and smoothed forms, which are sometimes almost reduced\r\nto the condition of a plain. Such regions occur in Ireland, in the west\r\nof Great Britain generally, in Brittany, in the central plateau of\r\nFrance, in the Ardennes, in Bohemia, in the central plateau of Spain, in\r\nScandinavia, and so forth. Between these relatively elevated areas we\r\nhave plains and low-lying river basins, such as the London basin, the\r\nParis basin, and so on. When the rocks are examined in both cases it is\r\nfound that in the basins and plains the rocks, as a general rule, are\r\nonly slightly inclined, while in the uplands and plateaux there are\r\nobvious remnants of folding, and the rocks are of ancient types, not\r\nrelatively modern like those of the Alps, Himalayas, etc. (see fig. 1).\r\n\r\nIf, then, the existing mountain chains show complex folding in their\r\nconstituent rocks, and though geologically but of yesterday have been\r\nalready deeply affected by the denuding agents, must we not suppose that\r\nthe folded and contorted uplands of Europe and elsewhere are the last\r\nremnants of very ancient mountain chains? It is they which form the\r\nframework of the continents, and by their wear and tear the low grounds\r\nhave been formed, owing to the filling in of the great gulfs which ran\r\nbetween the old mountain chains.\r\n\r\nWe may elaborate a little further this very interesting subject. Let us\r\nfirst note that the geologists group the rocks composing the earth's\r\ncrust into three great divisions. We have, first, the Primary rocks,\r\nwhich are the oldest, and include as their most generally interesting\r\nmember the Carboniferous rocks, with their coal-bearing beds, so\r\nimportant in the modern industrial world. Second, we have the Secondary\r\nbeds, the most interesting members of which is the Chalk, so\r\nwell-developed in parts of England and France. Finally, the Tertiary\r\nseries includes the rocks of the period immediately preceding that in\r\nwhich the first undoubted remains of man occur.\r\n\r\nEach of these periods was of enormous length, and the labours of\r\nsuccessive generations of geologists have brought to light, at least in\r\nbroad outline, the general appearance of the globe in so far as affected\r\nby the distribution of land and water, and the main earth movements, in\r\neach separate period. Thus we know that during that long period of time\r\nwhich is included in the Primary epoch, very extensive earth movements,\r\nresulting in extensive folding and mountain formation, took place. The\r\ngeologists distinguish no less than three separate periods of folding in\r\nPrimary times. It is not necessary for us to consider these in detail;\r\ntheir total result was to produce the mountain regions whose worn-down\r\nstumps now form those uplands which we have described in Europe. But\r\nthey do not occur in Europe alone. That vast and relatively infertile\r\narea in Eastern Canada which geologists call the Canadian Shield is a\r\nregion of very old rocks, once folded into a mountain region, but long\r\nsince worn down to an upland. In the eastern United States that long,\r\nbut interrupted, range of hills, which, under various names, runs from\r\nthe mouth of the St. Lawrence to Alabama and Georgia, and partially\r\nshuts the seaboard off from the prairies and plains beyond, is a region\r\nwhere the folding is still well marked, in spite of long denudation.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary period seems to have been one in which comparatively\r\nlittle folding took place, while, as already indicated, the Tertiary was\r\none in which there was enormous folding in almost all parts of the\r\nglobe, the result being the appearance at the surface of the great\r\nmountain chains of the present day. The structure of these chains makes\r\nthem relatively unstable, and the forces of erosion are now acting upon\r\nthem with extraordinary activity, beginning that process of wearing down\r\nwhich has reduced their prototypes of the Primary period to mere\r\nremnants of their former greatness.\r\n\r\nExtensive as the Tertiary folding was, however, it left great areas\r\nunaffected, or but slightly affected, and such areas form plains or\r\nbasins, where the rocks are but slightly tilted, or show a very simple\r\nform of folding. In Europe such slightly modified rocks occur, _e. g._\r\nin the Paris basin, and in the fertile plains of south-eastern England.\r\n\r\nIn the United States beds of a similar character occur right over the\r\ngreat plains, filling what seems once to have been a great gulf between\r\nthe old highlands to the east and the towering modern mountain chains of\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\nIt must be realised that this is only a very summary and partial account\r\nof a difficult and complicated problem; but from the standpoint of pure\r\ngeography it seems desirable to distinguish between those remnants of\r\nancient mountains which form the backbone of the continents, the\r\nrecently elevated mountain chains where enormously rapid erosion is\r\ntaking place, and the largely unmodified rocks which often form fertile\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nLet us next proceed to consider how the eroding agents act upon the\r\nsurface of the land as soon as it is exposed. We may begin with the\r\neffect of running water upon a recently exposed surface, _e. g._ upon\r\nland slowly emerging above sea-level, or even with the effect of heavy\r\nrain upon sloping ground unprotected by a covering of vegetation. Alike\r\nin the one case and in the other the first effect is the formation of a\r\nnumber of shallow rills, which at first run parallel to one another.\r\nSooner or later, however, these parallel channels tend to converge, and\r\na torrent is formed such as may be seen in any mountain region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--An ideal profile of a mature river (AC), showing\r\nthe increase in the slope towards the source. The dotted line BC shows\r\nan earlier stage, when there are smooth reaches and rapid reaches with\r\nwaterfalls, etc. Note that progressive erosion causes the source to\r\nretreat (_i. e._ from B to A).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--An actual profile of the Loire. It will be noted\r\nthat the Loire is a mature river, its profile nearly coinciding with the\r\n\"ideal\" condition. (After de Martonne.)]\r\n\r\nSuch a torrent consists of three often well-defined parts. First we have\r\nthe numerous tiny rills which collect together to form what the French\r\nphysiographers call a receiving basin (_bassin de réception_); then\r\nthere is the stream proper forming a canal which drains the basin, while\r\nbelow, where the torrent debouches on the low ground, we find that it\r\nspreads out fanwise and throws down its load of débris to form a cone\r\n(_cône de déjection_). The torrent therefore already imitates a\r\nfull-grown river, with its threefold division into mountain track,\r\nvalley track, and plain track. It further illustrates the twofold work\r\nof the river, that of erosion and deposition.\r\n\r\nObservation on an unprotected surface after a heavy rainfall will\r\nillustrate another point which is of much interest in connection with\r\nthe work of rivers. This is that the water has most excavating power,\r\nnot, as might be supposed, in the collecting basin, but in the valley\r\nregion, where the slope is still great, where the volume of the water is\r\nat its maximum, and where it has acquired a load of débris by means of\r\nwhich it carves out its bed. The excavation of the bed therefore\r\nproceeds from below upwards towards the collecting basin. The result is\r\nthat the slope of the valley floor diminishes as we pass from the upper\r\nregion to the lower, owing to the levelling effect of erosion. The\r\nprocess of levelling down cannot be carried beyond a certain point, the\r\nso-called base level of erosion, which in a lateral stream is\r\ndetermined by the point of junction with the main stream, and in a main\r\nstream by the point which marks sea or lake level, for obviously no\r\npoint in the river valley can be worn down much below its mouth.\r\n\r\nWhen the work of a river is completed, the line which marks the profile\r\nof its bed should have a gentle and continuous slope downwards to base\r\nlevel. The existence of irregularities, of breaks in the smoothness of\r\nthe slope, means that the work of excavation has not proceeded far, that\r\nthe river is young. But it is not necessary to proceed to the laborious\r\ndrawing of a profile in order to determine the extent to which the\r\nprocess of excavation has been carried. The existence of rapids, of\r\nwaterfalls, the alternation of swift and slow-flowing reaches are all\r\nproofs that it has not been carried far. In short, if a river is\r\nnavigable, the navigable reach at least is mature; if it is capable of\r\nfurnishing power, that region at least is youthful. If, as sometimes\r\nhappens, the middle course is navigable and slow-flowing, and the lower\r\ncourse broken by rapids and falls, then the probability is that earth\r\nmovements have occurred, so that the two regions are of different age.\r\nThis is a condition which occurs relatively often in the case of large\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nOne other point is worth notice, because it illustrates another way in\r\nwhich the analogy of youth and maturity holds good. The youthful river,\r\nwith its interrupted slope, its lakes and falls, does not permit the\r\nwater to flow off with the same regularity as the mature river with its\r\nsmoothed outlines. The mature river is thus a more perfect instrument of\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for our purpose to consider in detail the\r\ncharacteristic forms of river erosion. It may be sufficient to notice\r\nthat rapids and waterfalls are due to the varying hardness of the rocks\r\nforming the bed of the river, and that the normal course of events is\r\nthe transition from waterfall to rapid, and from rapid to stream flowing\r\nquietly at the bottom of a rocky gorge. Long gorges or canyons tend to\r\noccur in regions where river erosion is not greatly assisted by the\r\nother eroding agents. As a general rule, as the river cuts its way down,\r\nthe other agents cut back the walls so exposed, so that a wide valley is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nBut a river does not only eat out its bed in its valley track. A\r\nnecessary consequence of this erosion is that it is also able to eat\r\nback the slope on which it is rising, as a result of the smoothing out\r\nof the curves of its bed, so that its source retreats further and\r\nfurther into the mountain. In regions of abundant rainfall every slope\r\nis abundantly supplied with streams, and therefore those streams which\r\ncut back their region of origin most rapidly will necessarily encroach\r\nupon their neighbours' territory. They therefore tend to tap some of the\r\ntributaries of the other streams, a phenomenon which has sometimes\r\nconsiderable human importance, and has been extensively studied of late\r\nyears under the name of river-capture.\r\n\r\nSome examples may serve to make the phenomenon clear. Every one who has\r\ntravelled up the Rhone valley in Switzerland has noted the enormous\r\nnumber of lateral streams, of all sizes, which tumble down the mountain\r\nsides into the Rhone. These streams on, _e. g._, the south side, are,\r\nroughly speaking, parallel to each other, and to a large extent enter\r\nthe main stream independently. That is, for the most part they are very\r\nyouthful streams. In some cases, however, _e. g._ in the case of the\r\nDranse and the Visp, the drainage is of a more advanced character, and\r\nwe find a large stream with tributaries of considerable size as\r\ndistinct from mere torrents. A glance at any great river system on the\r\nmap, _e. g._ the Mississippi, the Amazon, etc., will show that the\r\ncondition of a great stream with many tributaries is normal in a\r\ndistrict where the drainage is of the developed type. How are the two\r\nconditions, that of numerous parallel mountain torrents and that of a\r\ngreat river system, related to one another? There is no doubt that\r\ncapture, the encroachment of one stream upon the territory of another,\r\nhas played an important part in the process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Sketch-map to illustrate river-capture.]\r\n\r\nA very simple example of this widespread phenomenon may be taken in\r\nillustration. The accompanying sketch-map, drawn by Mr. Lionel Hinxman,\r\nshows part of the course of the River Feshie, one of the tributaries of\r\nthe Spey, and part of the Geldie Burn, one of the tributaries of the\r\nAberdeenshire Dee. It will be noted that the Feshie shows a very curious\r\nbend, or elbow. Mr. Hinxman points out that this curious condition can\r\nbe explained on the supposition that the River Eidart, shown on the map\r\nto the north of the bend, once formed the headwaters of the Feshie,\r\nwhich cut its valley back until it captured the headwaters of the\r\nGeldie, and thus brought water which formerly flowed into the Dee into\r\nthe Spey valley. The boundary between the two counties of Aberdeen and\r\nInverness is shown on the map by a dotted line, and it is seen that the\r\nmarch follows the watershed, which between the present Geldie and the\r\nbend on the Feshie is very low. Formerly, however, this watershed lay\r\nmuch further to the west, and its shifting is due to the capture.\r\n\r\nA careful study of large scale maps will show many examples of similar\r\nriver-capture, some old and some recent. A sharp bend, the so-called\r\nelbow of capture, on a river in close proximity to another stream\r\naffords in itself a certain presumption that capture has taken place,\r\nthough this presumption can only be verified by study on the spot.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that before the capture is finally accomplished there\r\nmay be an intermediate stage when the water has the choice of two\r\nchannels, both of which may be utilised in a time of flood. A very\r\ncurious case is that of the Casiquiare, a river in South America which\r\nconnects together the two systems of the Amazon and the Orinoco, while\r\nanother is the connection recently discovered by Captain Lenfant, a\r\nFrench explorer, between the systems of the Shari and the Niger in\r\nAfrica. Such conditions are obviously unstable, for one stream must\r\nsooner or later predominate over the other, and deprive it even of flood\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAnother example may help to explain the evolution of a complex river\r\nsystem with many tributaries. A glance at the map of England (see\r\ndiagram) shows that while the rivers of Northumberland and Durham flow\r\nindependently into the sea, those of Yorkshire are united into a\r\ncharacteristic bunch, and all reach the ocean by means of the Humber.\r\nThis estuary breaks through the high ground formed by the Wolds of\r\nYorkshire and Lincolnshire, which consists of hard rock. At one time it\r\nis probable that the rivers of Yorkshire entered the sea separately,\r\nwhile the other great factor of the Humber, the Trent, mingled its\r\nwaters with the present Witham. At this time the weathering of the land\r\nsurface had not reached its present stage so the land would lie higher.\r\nIn what is now the vale of York the rocks are much softer than where the\r\nWolds now stand, and the present Ouse, which was at first a longitudinal\r\ntributary of a transverse stream, eating its way back through these soft\r\nrocks, tapped successively the streams flowing eastwards from the\r\nPennines, and with the help of the abundant water so obtained was\r\nenabled to cut out the wide estuary of the Humber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Sketch-map of northern England, to show the\r\nposition of the Tyne and Aire Gaps, and the peculiar character of the\r\nrivers of Yorkshire. The black areas are heights above 600 feet.]\r\n\r\nOne other important point in connection with river-capture has been\r\nalready suggested in the account given of the Feshie. In the little\r\nsketch-map we see clearly the shift of the watershed to the east. The\r\nultimate cause of this shift is doubtless the fact that in Great\r\nBritain the rainfall diminishes to the east, so that, generally\r\nspeaking, the westerly streams have more erosive power than the\r\neasterly. But the special interest of the case is simply that it may\r\nserve to suggest a fact not at first sight obvious, which is that\r\nwater-partings are excessively unstable features. One set of streams is\r\ncontinually striving to encroach upon the others, and by capturing their\r\nheadwaters to reduce their erosive power. A very striking example of\r\ncapture on the large scale is seen in southern Patagonia, where the\r\nwater-parting does not lie near the summit of the chain of the Andes, as\r\nmight be expected, but considerably to the east, the western streams (or\r\nglaciers) having captured all the headwaters of the eastern streams,\r\nwhich lie in a region of much lower rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe net result is that running water not only scours valleys in the\r\nsides of mountain chains, but also, sooner or later, wears away the\r\ncrest itself, and with the assistance of the other agents of denudation\r\ntends to reduce the mountains to plains--or at least \"peneplains.\" The\r\ndeduction is, of course, old enough, but the recent emphasis placed upon\r\nriver-capture helps us to realise it, showing us the actual \"shift of\r\nthe divide,\" or, in other words, the wearing down of the summit levels.\r\n\r\nThis is a theoretical matter, but there is another point which has\r\npractical significance. Referring once again to the sketch-map on p. 43,\r\nwe note that just at the sharp bend in the Feshie, that is, at the elbow\r\nof capture, there is a narrow region, crossed by the boundary line,\r\nwhich was once traversed by the headwaters of the Geldie, but is now a\r\ndry valley. Such \"gaps,\" as they are called, are present where recent\r\ncapture has occurred, and where they occur in hilly country they\r\nsometimes form useful passes, permitting the construction of an easy\r\nroad across the hills. A good example is the Aire Gap (see fig. 5) in\r\nthe Pennine range of Great Britain, apparently connected with the fact\r\nthat the Ribble has captured the headwaters of the Aire. Another\r\ninteresting example is the so-called Tyne Gap, that breach in the\r\nPennines which occurs near the present head of the South Tyne; it was\r\ntraversed by the Roman wall, and is now crossed by the road and the\r\nrailway from Newcastle to Carlisle.\r\n\r\nAs we shall see, ice appears to have this power of cutting passes\r\nthrough mountain chains to a much greater extent than running water; but\r\nhere, as in many other respects, there does not appear to be a sharp\r\nbreach between the action of the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nICE AND ITS WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we have spoken of the moulding of the surface of the\r\nearth by means of running water and the agents summed up in the term\r\n\"weathering.\" The process is sometimes called \"normal erosion,\" to\r\ndistinguish it from that other form of surface moulding in which ice and\r\nfrost play a prominent part. At the present time ice, in the form of\r\nice-sheets or glaciers, is confined to relatively small areas of the\r\nglobe, so that we are justified in regarding its action as exceptional\r\nwhen compared with the work of running water. It is, however, well known\r\nthat this limitation of the field of action of ice is very recent, and\r\nthat during a period which geologically is only yesterday, a much\r\ngreater part of the surface than at present was ice-clad.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, much of Europe, especially the northern parts and\r\nthose regions which lie close to the lofty mountain chains, much of\r\nNorth America, and, probably, considerable parts of the southern\r\nhemisphere, were subjected to the action of ice so recently that the\r\nprocesses of normal erosion have not had time to obliterate, hardly even\r\nto blur, the tracks which the ice left.\r\n\r\nThe results of the great extension of ice action in that period which\r\ngeologists call Pleistocene were twofold. In the first place, as the\r\nresult of the presence of the ice-sheet, we have vast accumulations of\r\ndébris spread over the lower grounds. These accumulations sometimes form\r\ngreat sheets of boulder clay; sometimes they are collected into the\r\ncurious sandy and gravelly mounds called kames which in parts of,\r\n_e. g._ Scotland, have a great extension; sometimes they have formed\r\ngreat heaps of material at the entrances of valleys. Again, these\r\ndeposits have sometimes blocked valleys and so formed lakes, and they\r\nhave supplied the post-glacial rivers with a vast amount of material\r\nwhich has been used to scour out the river-beds, and has been often\r\nre-sorted and re-arranged by running water.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the fact that the northern region and the high grounds\r\nfurther south, in both Europe and North America, have been recently clad\r\nin ice is associated with many peculiarities of surface form, some of\r\nwhich have exercised a marked influence on human settlements and ways of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nThese peculiarities of surface moulding have been the object of\r\nsingularly detailed study in late years, and from this detailed study\r\nmany interesting facts have emerged. It may be well to state at once\r\nthat this study has been largely stimulated by the fact that there is at\r\npresent a great want of unanimity of opinion as to the exact cause of\r\nthese peculiarities of form. According to one school ice is a more\r\npowerful eroding agent than water; according to another its action is\r\nlargely conservative, and its power of erosion is slight as compared\r\nwith that of water.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of a possible solution of the problem are perhaps to be\r\nseen in the suggestions of those who seek the causes of the peculiar\r\nfeatures of glaciated regions in the way in which running water works\r\nwhen it is controlled and modified by the existence of ice; but we must\r\nadmit that, on the whole, the conflict is still hot and many members of\r\nthe opposing schools will have no compromise.\r\n\r\nTo the geographer, however, the very fierceness of the controversy has\r\nbeen useful. The question as to the exact part played respectively by\r\nwater and by ice in surface moulding is really a question for the\r\ngeologist. It is, however, of great importance to the geographer that\r\nrecently glaciated surfaces should be studied from every point of view,\r\nfor from this detailed study are emerging many important\r\ngeneralisations. We shall, therefore, in this chapter only touch very\r\nlightly upon the actual points in dispute, but shall lay stress upon the\r\ninteresting facts admitted by both parties.\r\n\r\nWhen the conception of a just-vanished period of great glaciation was\r\nbeing established by the labours of many geologists, stress was\r\nnaturally laid upon the obvious resemblances between parts of, _e. g._\r\nScotland and Wales, and those parts of the Alps which have been exposed\r\nby the retreat of the existing glaciers. Thus we find that most of the\r\ntext-books emphasise the occurrence of perched blocks, of erratics,\r\n_i. e._ of blocks of rock which must have been carried from a distance,\r\nof the phenomenon of crag and tail, of giants' kettles, and so on. All\r\nthese are of more geological than geographical importance; they do not\r\nin themselves greatly affect the distribution of other phenomena over\r\nthe surface. We shall not, therefore, stop to consider them in detail.\r\nIt is otherwise with those indications of recent glaciation which have\r\nbeen studied within the last few years, and they demand the geographer's\r\nmost careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe most active discussion has taken place in regard to the peculiar\r\nfeatures of the valleys in recently-glaciated districts, and we shall\r\ndiscuss especially this point.\r\n\r\nWe have already described the general features presented by valleys\r\nwhich owe their origin to running water. In such valleys, as we have\r\nseen, the longer the forces work the more nearly is the valley floor\r\nreduced to an even slope, whose angle decreases in passing from the\r\nmountain to the plain track. In the ordinary river valley the shape of\r\nthe valley approximates to that of a V, that is, the valley narrows\r\ndownwards, the river occupying the narrowest region.\r\n\r\nAgain, as a general rule there is no great difference of level between\r\nthe tributary valleys--at least at their extremities--and the main\r\nvalley, that is, there is no sharp discordance between the two. While,\r\nhowever, the \"mature\" river valley shows a gentle, continuous slope, we\r\nusually find that \"young\" rivers, at least in their mountain track, show\r\nan alternation of plain and gorge, which is very easily observed in any\r\nhilly region.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we find that, owing to the inclination of the rocks, or\r\nto their varying hardness, or to other causes, particular reaches are\r\nless easily eroded than others. These form waterfalls, which ultimately,\r\nas we have seen, give place to gorges. Beyond the waterfall the\r\ndiminishing slope checks the rapidity of flow, and the stream tends to\r\nwiden out, and also to throw down its load of débris, so that an\r\nalluvial plain may be formed.\r\n\r\nOne other character of an ordinary river valley may be noted. It heads,\r\nas we have seen, in a collecting basin, which receives the surface\r\nrunnels and the outflows of the springs which form the beginning of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the valleys in a recently glaciated country. We omit\r\nany description of existing glaciers; these will be found described in\r\nthe volume on the Alps, and further, photography and the picture\r\npostcard have rendered the main features of a glacier familiar to every\r\none. Almost every large railway station now shows fine coloured\r\nphotographs of some of the important Swiss glaciers.\r\n\r\nTaking, then, a valley known to have been occupied by a Pleistocene\r\nglacier, we find the following features. As contrasted with an ordinary\r\nriver valley, the glacial valley is usually flat-bottomed, a condition\r\ndescribed as U-shaped to point the contrast with the river valley.\r\nExamples in Great Britain and elsewhere are frequent, but some of the\r\nAlpine valleys show the phenomenon in a very striking form. Two good\r\nexamples are the Aar valley at Meiringen, and the Lauterbrunnen valley\r\nat the village of the same name. Both have been rendered more or less\r\nfamiliar by constant photographing (see fig. 7).\r\n\r\nThe reason why they have been so much photographed leads us to consider\r\nanother peculiarity of the glaciated valley. In both the cases named a\r\nsteep cliff wall rises from either side of the broad, flat valley\r\nfloor, and from the summit of this cliff the lateral streams leap into\r\nthe main valley by often superb waterfalls. This is a very important\r\nfeature of glaciated valleys--the fact that their tributaries are\r\nmarkedly _discordant_, that is, that there is marked difference of level\r\nbetween the beds of the side and main streams.\r\n\r\nBecause the side valleys lie high above the main they are said to\r\n\"hang,\" and are called hanging valleys, while the main valley is said to\r\nbe over-deepened. The rocky height over which the water springs may be\r\ncalled the junction step, as an attempt to translate the French term\r\n_gradin de confluence_ which is applied to it.\r\n\r\nIncidentally we may note that in the Alps the junction step is of great\r\nhuman importance. Its presence gives the water the power which is used\r\nin lighting the Alpine villages with electricity, and in driving the\r\ntrains which often carry the tourist to those villages. In the French\r\nand Italian Alps especially, the power is being more and more used to\r\nsupply the motive force for various minor manufactures, notably for the\r\nproduction of nitrogenous manure from the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--A diagrammatic cross-section of a recently\r\nglaciated valley. AB, the mountain slope which rose above the ancient\r\nglacier and has therefore retained the sharp, unrounded forms due to\r\nordinary weathering.

The dotted line connecting CC shows the probable form of\r\nthe pre-glacial valley; CD, the rocky wall of the existing U-shaped\r\nvalley on whose floor the river now flows.]\r\n\r\nAssociated with the hanging valleys of Alpine regions is the presence\r\nof a curious shelf, shoulder, or \"bench,\" which frequently lies on the\r\ntop of the cliff from which the lateral streams spring (see figs. 6 and\r\n7). Any one who has done some walking in the Alps, must have noticed a\r\npeculiar and often trying feature of any walk which leads up the side of\r\nthe valley. This is that the walk begins with a very steep ascent,\r\nwhere the road or track zig-zags to and fro. After this steep and trying\r\nclimb the walker reaches a broad shelf (BC in figs. 6 and 7), where the\r\nslope is much less, and where the extent of relatively level ground\r\ngives room for the erection of a huge hotel, or perhaps only of a group\r\nof chalets. This shelf is covered with fine herbage, destined to be\r\ncropped by the cows of the community.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--An actual cross-section of the Lauterbrunnen\r\nvalley. The vertical and horizontal scales are the same. B marks the\r\nedge of the cliff wall over which the streams leap in cascades. A is the\r\nposition of the stream at the bottom of the U-shaped valley. BC marks\r\nthe position of the shelf, largely occupied by the pastures or alps.\r\nAbove them are rocky, unsmoothed slopes.]\r\n\r\nIf the traveller continue his walk he will find that above this pasture\r\nground or _alp_ the slopes are again steep up to the mountain summits.\r\nPossibly, however, his walk has been to see a famous waterfall from\r\nabove, and he will find that the streams which flow with relative\r\nslowness over the comparatively gentle slopes of the alp or shelf, will\r\nat some point tumble over the region up which he climbed, probably in a\r\nseries of leaps or cascades.\r\n\r\nThe U-shaped valley, the \"hanging\" tributaries, the shelf or shoulder\r\nrunning along the upper part of the cliff wall which bounds the main\r\nvalley, all these are striking features of glaciated regions. We shall\r\nnot here discuss the probable causes of this striking \"break of slope,\"\r\nso different from the characteristically continuous slopes of an\r\nordinary mature river valley. As has been indicated, it is here that\r\nactive controversy rages. It is, however, important to note that the\r\nshoulder or bench of which we have spoken was almost certainly once\r\ncovered by the ice, its gentle slope indicating the original valley\r\nfloor, before over-deepening took place.\r\n\r\nThe reason why pasture now grows upon it is that it is covered with fine\r\nglacial débris, which makes fertile soil. The fertile soil, which is\r\noften irrigated by milky water from existing glaciers, combined with the\r\neffect of altitude upon the plants, produces rich pasturage, and makes\r\ncattle-rearing an important alpine industry.\r\n\r\nThe next interesting feature of glaciated regions is the occurrence of\r\nthose curious mountain forms which have special names in nearly every\r\nrecently-glaciated region. Those gigantic arm-chair-shaped notches, high\r\nup on the mountain sides, which the Welsh call cwms, the Scotch corries,\r\nthe French cirques, and the Germans kare, are very widespread in the\r\nHighlands of Scotland, in the mountains of Wales, in the Tyrol, and in\r\nother parts of the Alps (though they are not common in the Central\r\nregion), and in North America as well as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA cirque (fig. 8) is shaped something like an office arm-chair. The\r\nfloor has only a gentle downward slope, and often lodges a lake; or in\r\nother cases it is marshy, showing that a lake was once present. The back\r\nand sides are steep and precipitous. In some instances, if several\r\ncirques occur near together, the side walls may be eroded through, so\r\nthat a shelf is produced, as one might produce a bench by putting two\r\nchairs side by side, and cutting away the contiguous arms. Very often,\r\nas one may easily see in the Highlands of Scotland, a series of cirques\r\noccur, one above the other, so that a climber proceeding from the valley\r\nfloor upwards has a succession of steep \"pitches,\" to use a\r\nmountaineering term, alternating with easy if wet walks across the\r\nfloors of the successive cirques.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Diagram showing two glacial cirques.]\r\n\r\nIt quite often happens in the case of high mountains in the Alps that\r\nthe topmost of such a series of cirques still retains a glacier, what is\r\ncalled a dead glacier, that is, one which has practically ceased to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, again, we may find that what should be the flat floor\r\nof the cirque has been largely eaten away, as it were, by a huge rounded\r\ntrough, which occupies what would be the extreme front of the seat of\r\nthe arm-chair. In this trough a stream runs, and the trough has the\r\ncharacteristic U-shaped rounding characteristic of glacial forms.\r\nFurther, at the top of the wall of the trough a bench or shelf exists,\r\nwhich is obviously the remains of the old cirque floor. In the case of\r\nall characteristic glacial cirques, however, the special feature is that\r\nthe flat bottom of the cirque is discontinuous with the valley below;\r\nthey are not parts of the same system of drainage. What we may call an\r\nunconformity appears between the two regions, more or less marked\r\naccording as running water has or has not had time to begin the work of\r\nthe removal of the unconformity.\r\n\r\nThe immediate human importance of these corries or cirques is not so\r\napparent as in the case of hanging valleys, but they must be mentioned,\r\nif only because of their extraordinary abundance in glaciated regions,\r\nand especially in Great Britain. There are two views as to their origin,\r\nand we shall indicate both here without making any attempt to decide\r\nwhich is the correct one. A very full and clear statement of one\r\nposition will be found in an article by Prof. Garwood in the\r\n_Geographical Journal_ for September 1910, while previous articles by\r\nProf. Davis and others in this journal formulate the opposed view.\r\n\r\nTo the first school the corrie is simply in origin the collecting basin\r\nof a pre-glacial stream, such a basin tending to acquire, roughly\r\nspeaking, a flattish bottom and somewhat steep sides. With the onset of\r\nthe ice the floor of the basin was protected by the ice from further\r\nerosion, while the frost ate back the wall and so steepened it, and the\r\nglacier carried away all débris as it formed. At a later stage the lower\r\npart of the glacier disappeared and only the cirque glacier was left. It\r\ncontinued its protective action, while below the powerful torrents\r\nhollowed out a trough. This process was perhaps repeated several times,\r\nwith the final result that the protected cirque was left as a\r\nmuch-modified remnant of pre-glacial conditions, while the valley below\r\nwas powerfully eroded by the glacial torrents. Thus a cirque lying above\r\nan existing valley is to be regarded as the beheaded end of an old\r\nvalley, preserved by its ice covering, while below the old valley has\r\nbeen fundamentally modified by the scour of the glacial torrents. On\r\nthis view the sharp distinction between the two angles of slope marks\r\nthe distinction between the work of ice (protective) and the work of\r\nwater (erosive). A series of cirques means a succession of glacial and\r\ninterglacial periods.\r\n\r\nAccording to the other school, for whom ice is a more powerful eroding\r\nagent than water, the cirque was produced by the ice, its presence or\r\nabsence, in _e. g._ the Alps, being determined by the shape of the\r\npre-glacial mountains. Cirques are believed to have been produced by the\r\nice wherever the form of the mountains conduced to the accumulation of\r\nsnow, and the occurrence of a series of cirques, and of the troughs\r\nwhich seem sometimes to eat into their floors, is ascribed to the\r\nsuccessive retreat of the great ice-plough, _i. e._ to the action of the\r\nretreating ice itself, and not to the water which flows from beneath it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother striking feature of many glacial valleys is a very marked want\r\nof continuity in the slope of the main valley. Not only do the side\r\nvalleys \"hang\" over the main valleys, but, further, this main valley\r\nitself often consists of relatively level reaches alternating with rocky\r\nbars, through which the river has sometimes later cut a gorge. Examples\r\nof this are very frequent. The famous gorge of the Aar above Meiringen\r\nis a river gorge cut through a rocky bar of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe Pyrenees are somewhat less familiar, both to tourists and in the\r\nform of pictures, but there, also, the same thing occurs. Above the\r\nhealth resort of Cauterets lies the little Lac de Gaube, whose mouth is\r\nblocked by a rocky bar through which the little torrent is cutting a\r\ntiny gorge. If the tourist crosses the lake in a boat and begins to walk\r\nup the valley above it, he will find that it has the form of a\r\nstaircase, the huge steps being separated from one another by broad\r\nplateaux, which are flat and swampy, and have obviously been occupied by\r\nlakes not long ago. Above each plateau there is a rocky wall, almost\r\nprecipitous, down which the stream flows in cascades. In other parts of\r\nthe Pyrenees the same phenomenon occurs, and the lakes sometimes\r\npersist, lying one above the other in a series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Profile of the Maderaner thal in Switzerland, to\r\nshow the staircase arrangement peculiar to recently glaciated valleys.\r\n(From Garwood.)]\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon is so common that it markedly affects human life in the\r\nAlps. The \"landings,\" as the French call them, usually afford good\r\npasture ground, while those which lie at no great elevation can be\r\ncultivated. Further, as the ground is level there is room for houses or\r\neven for a considerable village. The intervening region or step is too\r\nrocky to give level ground for human habitations or for pasture and\r\ncultivation. Where the river has had time to cut a gorge, the road must\r\nleave the stream, and can often be constructed only with difficulty. The\r\nresult is that an Alpine valley often consists of a chain of villages,\r\nlinked together by a difficult mule track or path. The abundant\r\nwater-power, however, makes mechanical traction relatively easy, and we\r\nhave sometimes the curious condition that a mule track is replaced by a\r\nrailway, without the intervention of a road fit for wheeled traffic.\r\n\r\nWe need not stop to discuss the probable cause of this step and stair\r\narrangement, which presents much the same problem as the series of\r\ncirques at the head of the valley. It is enough to indicate that\r\naccording to one group of physical geographers the flat landings are due\r\nto the way in which the gradually decreasing glacier protected its bed\r\nfrom erosion, while the torrent which issued from it eroded very rapidly\r\nbelow; according to another school the landings are due to direct\r\nglacial erosion. There are other observers, again, who lay especial\r\nstress upon the modifications of the erosive powers of running water,\r\ndue to the presence of the ice. For us it is of interest to notice that,\r\nas has been already indicated, the staircase effect occurs also, though\r\non a smaller scale, in the case of mountain streams generally, some of\r\nwhich must be post-glacial in origin. In other words, there seems to be\r\nfundamental similarity between the work of ice and of water, the\r\ndifferences being differences of degree rather than of kind, and due\r\nlargely to the varying fluidity of the two.\r\n\r\nThere is still one other feature of glaciated regions to which reference\r\nmust be made. This is the occurrence of peculiarly open passes in\r\nconsiderable numbers across mountain regions which have been recently\r\nglaciated. In the geography books and in some maps, the Alps, for\r\nexample, are represented as a great barrier, shutting off the fertile\r\nplains of Italy from the countries of Central Europe. But history shows\r\nthat they have never been such a barrier, and the phrase of \"splendid\r\ntraitor\" has been applied to the whole mountain range, in order to\r\nemphasise its total inadequacy as a barrier, either to armed or to\r\npeaceful invasion.\r\n\r\nSince the time of Napoleon I public attention has been focussed upon a\r\nfew great Alpine passes, notably the Mont Cenis, the Simplon and the St.\r\nGothard, which are crossed by great carriage roads, now functionally\r\nreplaced by railway tunnels beneath. But we must not forget that in\r\naddition to these and the other great passes there are almost\r\ninnumerable ways of crossing the Alps on foot, and the presence either\r\nof Hospices or of small inns on many of the smaller passes shows that\r\nthey are constantly used at the present time, in spite of railway\r\ntunnels and carriage roads elsewhere. Even a pass relatively so\r\ndifficult as the Théodule, was used by very large numbers of Italian\r\npeasants during the time when work on the Simplon railway made great\r\ndemands on Italian labour.\r\n\r\nAny one of the passes, great or small, shows in outline the same\r\ncharacters. There is a steep ascent, often steeper on the Italian than\r\non the other side, then a broad, windswept, open summit, sometimes\r\nalmost level, below which the rapid descent begins. Not infrequently a\r\nlake, or lakes, may be found near the summit.\r\n\r\nOn a smaller scale the same phenomenon occurs in such glaciated regions\r\nas Scotland, the relatively low connections between one valley system\r\nand another greatly facilitating communication, and usually carrying\r\nboth road and railway, where the latter exists. Such connections between\r\ntwo drainage systems (that is, the existence of a very low divide\r\nbetween the two) only exist on a small scale outside glaciated regions,\r\nso that they, with all their effects upon communications, must be\r\nlargely ascribed to ice-action. We shall describe one case in a little\r\ndetail, with the proviso that while no one denies the frequency of such\r\npasses in glaciated regions, some authorities believe that their\r\nproduction was due more to glacial torrents than to the erosive action\r\nof ice itself.\r\n\r\nA very pretty example is the picturesque pass known as the Gemmi, which\r\nis traversed only by a mule path, and connects Kandersteg, and thus the\r\nlake of Thun and the town of Berne, with the Rhone valley, which the\r\npath enters at the village of Leuk. The walk proper is, however, over at\r\nthe Baths of Leuk, a small health resort lying at the foot of the great\r\nGemmiwand, a wall of rock over 1,600 feet in height on the summit of\r\nwhich is the Gemmi pass. Readers of Mark Twain's _A Tramp Abroad_ will\r\nremember his interesting description of the crossing of the pass, which\r\nis part of the regulation tour in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe excursion may be very briefly described. The traveller starts from\r\nthe village of Kandersteg, and almost immediately begins a steep climb,\r\nwhich after a rise of over 2,000 feet leads him over a ridge to a\r\npasture, once swept by an avalanche. Another short but steep rise (note\r\nthe staircase arrangement) leads him to the lonely Daubensee, a little\r\nlake which is frozen for more than half the year and has no outlet. It\r\nis itself fed by a glacier lying to the traveller's right, the Laemmern\r\nglacier, which is shrinking and exposing more and more of its old bed.\r\nEven to the most inexperienced traveller it is obvious that this present\r\nday shrinkage is, as it were, the last remnant of a shrinkage which has\r\nbeen going on for a prolonged period, so that the route by which the\r\ntraveller ascended from Kandersteg is but a remnant of the bed of the\r\nold glacier. The point of special interest, however, is that at the end\r\nof the Daubensee the traveller leaves the glacial valley by which he has\r\nascended, and passing through a great notch or gateway in a wall of\r\nrock, begins the almost precipitous descent to Leukerbad, which lies at\r\nhis feet, 1,600 feet below. It is this notch which makes the pass, and\r\nit is fundamentally a breach in the mountain wall which separates the\r\ndrainage of the Rhine from that of the Rhone. Comparing small things\r\nwith great we may note that this gateway presents some resemblance to\r\nthe Tyne and Aire Gaps in the Pennines, already mentioned, which may\r\nalso have been modified by ice-action.\r\n\r\nThe explanation given is as follows:--At the time when the glaciation\r\nreached its maximum height the mass of ice in what is now the Laemmern\r\nglacier was so great that it could not be contained within its own\r\nvalley. The ice was piled up so high that it over-rode the watershed,\r\nrose up beyond the containing wall of its own valley, and pushed a long\r\narm over the valley wall, down into the Rhone valley. This tongue of\r\nice, either by its own erosive power, or because of the glacial and\r\nsub-glacial streams which it produced, wore out a notch in the wall as\r\nit crossed, and it is this notch which makes the pass. As the glacier\r\ngradually shrank, it could no longer send this tributary over the wall\r\ninto the valley below, and was constrained to send all its drainage into\r\nits own valley, that is ultimately into the Rhine. But the Gemmi pass\r\npersists as a proof of its former magnitude, of the fact that once part\r\nof the Laemmern drainage reached the Mediterranean instead of the North\r\nSea, that there was once a communication between the Rhine and the Rhone\r\ndrainage systems.\r\n\r\nMany at least of the great Alpine passes are believed to have been\r\nproduced in this way, and therefore we must add to the peculiarities of\r\nrecently-glaciated countries, the fact that passes are likely to be\r\nfrequent across their hills and valleys, owing to the power which ice\r\npossesses, when enormously developed, of rising above valley walls, and\r\nstreaming down into another valley system. Some of the great Alpine\r\npasses, perhaps, arose in other ways, but this brief description may be\r\nof interest as suggesting one, probably common, mode of origin.\r\n\r\nIf we sum up what has been said as to the special features of glaciated\r\nregions, we may note that their valleys tend to be U-shaped, and to be\r\ndiscontinuous with their tributary valleys, which \"hang\" over them. On\r\nthe top of the cliff from which these tributary streams leap is a shelf,\r\nwhich is clearly a portion of the floor of the pre-glacial valley and is\r\ncovered by glacial débris. At the heads of the valleys there are often\r\ncirques or plateaux, which again are markedly discordant, hanging high\r\nabove the valley below. In the main valley itself there are similar\r\ndiscordances, giving rise to a staircase arrangement. Finally, different\r\nvalley systems often communicate with each other by passes, natural\r\nhighways which hang high above both valley systems alike.\r\n\r\nObviously, however, we might replace this detailed summary by the simple\r\nstatement that whereas in a region subjected only to the action of\r\nrunning water, there is a marked tendency to continuity of slopes\r\nthroughout, a tendency more and more marked the longer the water acts,\r\nin glaciated regions there is an equally obvious discordance, a\r\ndiscontinuity of slope, most marked where water has not had time to\r\nbegin its smoothing action. As every glaciated valley which we can study\r\nin detail has been subjected to the action both of ice and of water, it\r\nis a simple deduction that the discontinuity is due to the differential\r\naction of the two. This is the point of geographical importance, and to\r\nthe geographer it is of minor importance to know whether it is the\r\npassive resistance of the ice which has caused the discontinuity, or\r\nwhether it is the water which has been unable to keep pace with the\r\nactivity of the ice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is one other point which must be alluded to even in this very\r\nbrief consideration of the effect of the ice age upon the physical\r\ngeography of the glaciated regions. This is the fact that it greatly\r\nmodified the numbers and distribution of plants and animals throughout\r\nthe areas affected. Obviously the covering of ice must have rendered a\r\nlarge part of Europe uninhabitable both for man and for the vast\r\nmajority of animals and plants. In Europe, therefore, as also in North\r\nAmerica, there must have been a southward sweep of all living organisms,\r\ndriven from their original habitat by the onset of the cold period. But\r\nthe conditions in the two continents differed greatly.\r\n\r\nIn North America, especially in the east, there are no transverse chains\r\nof mountains, there is no southern sea until the Gulf of Mexico is\r\nreached in lat. 30°, and even here Florida almost touches the tropic,\r\nand Mexico extends far beyond it. In this continent, therefore, the\r\nplants and animals, though driven far to the south, still found room to\r\nlive and multiply, and had no great obstacle to cross either in their\r\nsouthward journey, or when they strove to re-annex their old territory\r\nas the cold conditions passed away again.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the forest trees of eastern Asia and of\r\neastern North America show a remarkable resemblance to one another, and\r\nboth regions are very rich in species and in genera. It is believed that\r\nthis rich North American flora is a remnant of pre-glacial conditions,\r\nand that its persistence is due to the ease with which the trees\r\nobtained an asylum to the south during the period when the climate was\r\nmost severe.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, in spite of the fact that the winter climate is much milder\r\nthan in corresponding latitudes in North America, the number of kinds of\r\nforest trees is much less, there is little resemblance to those of Asia\r\nand the eastern United States, and the trees have generally a less\r\nsouthern aspect. This is the more remarkable in that trees of southern\r\nfacies introduced from China and Japan and from the United States thrive\r\nadmirably in Europe, showing that there is no climatic obstacle to their\r\npresence there. To mention only a few examples, the Tree of Heaven\r\n(_Ailanthus glandulosa_), so very common, even as a wild tree in many\r\nparts of the continent of Europe, was introduced from China, while the\r\nbeautiful _Sophora japonica_, so frequently planted in towns, comes, as\r\nits name indicates, from Japan, and the various species of those\r\nbeautiful flowering trees known as Catalpa are either American or\r\nAsiatic. The western plane (_Platanus occidentalis_), another favourite\r\ntown tree, comes from the United States, and other American trees which\r\nare found very abundantly in towns in the warmer parts of Europe are the\r\nblack walnut and the honey locust (_Gleditschia tricanthos_). Perhaps\r\nmore striking than any of these is the case of the so-called false\r\nacacia (_Robinia pseudacacia_), which is as common over a great part of\r\nthe continent of Europe as hawthorn bushes or wild roses are with us,\r\nand yet is a North American species, introduced less than three hundred\r\nyears ago. Generally, we may say that all the more beautiful trees now\r\ngrowing in the warmer parts of Europe come either from eastern Asia or\r\nfrom the United States. In other words, the Ice Age seems to have\r\ngreatly impoverished the flora of Europe. To a less extent this is also\r\ntrue of western North America, which has fewer species of trees than the\r\neast.\r\n\r\nWhy had the ice this impoverishing effect upon Europe? The topography of\r\nthe continent supplies the answer. In the first place, in Europe there\r\nare numerous transverse chains of mountains. The Pyrenees, the Alps, the\r\nCaucasus, each with its load of ice, each with glaciers deploying on the\r\nlow ground at its feet, must have been obstacles in the way of the\r\nsouthern migration alike of plants and of animals. Again, even if these\r\nobstacles were passed or turned, the great inland sea formed another\r\nbarrier further south. In consequence of this difficulty in finding\r\nasylums the pre-glacial plants and animals must have perished in\r\nconsiderable numbers, and thus a general impoverishment took place. One\r\nmust not of course exaggerate. A proportion of the pre-glacial forms did\r\nsucceed in living through the period of stress, but many must have been,\r\nas it were, squeezed out of Europe or out of existence by the\r\nunfavourable climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nAs the climate improved the lands swept bare once again became\r\ninhabitable, and there was a recolonisation by movements from the south\r\nand from the east. We shall indicate later how man himself came from\r\nthe south and the east to colonise the west and north, but his movements\r\nwere only part of a great series which included also those of plants and\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCLIMATE AND WEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the superficial observer those daily variations in the atmospheric\r\nconditions in any one locality which we sum up under the term weather,\r\nmay appear to occur without order or regularity, but detailed quantitive\r\nstudy soon shows that even British weather displays constancy in its\r\nirregularity. The existence of such basal constancy, indeed, lies at the\r\nroot of all intelligent utilisation of the soil. The irresponsible\r\namateur gardener may lightheartedly assume that a particular spring will\r\nbe \"early,\" but the professional is not easily induced to abandon his\r\nrule that such and such operations must not be undertaken before certain\r\nfixed dates. The farmer, if he is to avoid bankruptcy, must know within\r\nwhat limits the first autumn frost is likely to make its appearance,\r\nand when the last spring one may be expected.\r\n\r\nCollective experience, then, whether expressed in the meteorologist's\r\nfigures or in a less accurate form, leads us to the conclusion that for\r\nevery locality on the earth's surface there is a certain fixed average\r\nsuccession of weather, which we sum up in the term _climate_.\r\n\r\nIn the case of both climate and weather our knowledge may be summed up\r\nin such general terms as \"wet\" or \"dry,\" \"warm\" or \"cold,\" and so forth,\r\nor we may borrow the meteorologist's notations, and express the facts in\r\ndegrees of temperature, inches of rainfall and of pressure, percentages\r\nof humidity, and so on. But it should be understood that such figures\r\ncan be used by the geographer with justification only when he is himself\r\naware, and can assume that his audience is aware, of the significance of\r\nthe figures in connection with the processes of erosion and the\r\nphenomena of life. To say that the mean January temperature of a\r\nparticular place is 30° F., is only a convenient shorthand way of saying\r\nthat in this place in winter plant life is arrested, water is ice-bound,\r\nand most animals sleep or migrate. In other words, the use of the\r\nfigures assumes a certain knowledge of biology and of physics on the\r\npart of the audience.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose here to treat either climate or weather with any\r\nfullness, for there is a volume in the series specially devoted to these\r\nand kindred subjects. All that will be attempted, therefore, is to\r\ndiscuss one or two important climates with the object of considering\r\nlater their respective effects on the distribution of other phenomena on\r\nthe surface of the globe. This is the more worth doing in that the\r\nsubject is one which has had a great deal of attention devoted to it in\r\nrecent years.\r\n\r\nCertain points in regard to climate, _e. g._ the fact that the regions\r\nof the earth near the equator get more solar heat than those nearer the\r\npoles, and that parts of the globe are subjected to variable winds, as\r\ncontrasted with those regions where the extraordinarily regular winds\r\ncalled \"trades\" blow, have of course been known for long enough. But not\r\ntill the latter half of the nineteenth century did the civilised nations\r\nbegin regular meteorological observations, and these observations are\r\nstill scanty for the uncivilised and partially civilised regions. The\r\nmeteorological raw material necessary for the exact study of climates\r\nhas thus only been available for a comparatively short period, and is\r\nstill incomplete.\r\n\r\nWe may begin with that type of climate which has so profoundly\r\ninfluenced the civilisation of western Europe, and therefore also the\r\nnew civilisations of America, Australia, South Africa, and so on. This\r\nis the type called Mediterranean, because it reaches its best\r\ndevelopment and has been most studied round the Mediterranean area. But\r\nit also occurs in California, in parts of Chile, in South Africa round\r\nCape Colony, and in south and south-western Australia. Generally, it is\r\ncharacteristic of lands lying on the western side of continents, in the\r\nlatitudes between tropical and temperate, and is therefore sometimes\r\ncalled the maritime sub-tropical climate. The term maritime is applied\r\nbecause, as we shall see, for some part of the year oceanic influences\r\nprevail, sub-tropical indicates the position in latitude.\r\n\r\nA very curious illustration of the similarity of climate in the\r\ndifferent regions named is to be found in the fact that in parts of the\r\nMediterranean area two introduced American plants, the agave and the\r\nprickly pear, are more obvious and abundant than most native plants;\r\nwhile in California, Cape Colony and southern Australia the cultivated\r\nplants are chiefly of Mediterranean origin.\r\n\r\nThe main features of the Mediterranean climate may be briefly\r\nsummarised. The most important character, next to the mild temperature,\r\nis the fact that no rain (or very little) falls in summer, the growing\r\nseason further north, which is here largely a period of cessation of\r\nplant growth. The rain, which tends to be scanty or even absent in the\r\ninterior of land masses, _e. g._ in Spain and Asia Minor, and also to\r\nthe south, _e. g._ in the Desert of Sahara, in the Mediterranean region\r\nproper falls in the winter months. It is this winter rainfall and the\r\nsummer drought which define the Mediterranean type of climate.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this seasonal distribution of rainfall is as interesting\r\nas the fact itself, and to understand it we must turn to the circulation\r\nof air on the surface of the globe.\r\n\r\nIn the following description we shall restrict ourselves, for the sake\r\nof clearness, to the Mediterranean region itself, the region where the\r\nMediterranean type of climate is developed over the largest area, and\r\nwhere, for many reasons, it is most important. But it must be noted that\r\nthe conditions which give rise to the Mediterranean type of climate are\r\nthe same wherever it occurs, though in the Mediterranean area they are\r\ngreatly modified by the great inland sea of that name, which carries\r\noceanic conditions far into the land.\r\n\r\nWe must note, first, that at all seasons those regions of the earth\r\nwhich are directly beneath the vertical rays of the sun are heated most\r\nintensely. Therefore the air over these regions, being rendered light by\r\nheating, rises, and a belt of low pressure is thus formed. Only at the\r\nequinoxes does this belt of high temperature, low pressure, and light\r\nwinds or calms, coincide with the equator. In the northern summer it\r\nmoves north with the sun; in the northern winter it travels south with\r\nthe sun, being always over what is called the _heat equator_. Into this\r\nbelt of low pressure air from north and south, where the pressure is\r\ngreater, tends to rush in, and we have thus formed the constant or\r\n\"trade\" winds, which, owing to the deflection produced by the earth's\r\nrotation, appear as the north-east trades in the northern hemisphere and\r\nthe south-east in the south. These winds are dry winds, because they\r\nblow from colder to warmer latitudes, and they accompany the equatorial\r\nlow-pressure belt in its north and south movements.\r\n\r\nIn the northern summer the trade winds may extend northward to lat. 35°\r\nor even 40°, while in winter their northern limit is 10° to 15° further\r\nsouth. A glance at the map, then, will show that in summer the\r\nMediterranean area is within or near the sphere of action of the dry\r\ntrade winds, which are continental, sweeping into the region after\r\nhaving blown over land surfaces.\r\n\r\nWe must next consider the atmospheric movements in the region to the\r\nnorth of the trade wind belt. An area of more or less permanent low\r\npressure, best marked in winter, exists in the North Atlantic, in about\r\n60° N. lat., and draws the air into it in the direction known as\r\ncounterclockwise, that is, in the direction opposite to that of the\r\nhands of the clock. The result is the production of the winds which\r\nappear off the coast of western Europe as the warm south-westerly winds\r\nof winter, while they appear off the coast of North America as cold\r\nnortherly winds. In the southern hemisphere, where, as we have seen,\r\nthere is less land to interfere with the development of the atmospheric\r\ncirculation, these winds form the prevailing westerlies.\r\n\r\nIn the Atlantic these south-westerly winds obviously blow in a direction\r\nopposite to the north-east trades, whence the name of anti-trades often\r\ngiven to them. As they blow across the broad Atlantic they arrive off\r\nEurope saturated with moisture. As they come from lower latitudes they\r\nare warmth bringing. In winter these winds reach the Mediterranean area\r\nowing to the southern shift of the trades, and bring moisture with them;\r\nwhile in summer they lie more to the north, and though their moisture\r\naffects the coast of Portugal it does not reach the greater part of the\r\nMediterranean area.\r\n\r\nWithin that area the northern limit of the rainless summer may be said,\r\nin a rough sense, to correspond with about the 40th parallel of\r\nlatitude, though it varies according to local conditions in the\r\ndifferent peninsulas. To the north of this line, therefore, the climate\r\nis more or less affected even in summer by the anti-trades.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the region of the trade winds and of the\r\nanti-trades lie side by side. Between the two there is a zone of\r\nvariable winds, but in general terms we can explain the peculiarities of\r\nthe Mediterranean rainfall by saying that the region lies within or\r\njust at the edge of the dry trades in summer, and within the zone of the\r\nmoist anti-trades in winter.\r\n\r\nLet us next consider how the area is demarcated from the surrounding\r\nregions. There is of course no hard and fast line, but we can indicate\r\nin broad outline the meteorological limits. To take the absolutely\r\nrainless summer as the limit would cut out, as we have suggested above,\r\nthe greater part of the northern shore of the Mediterranean, except the\r\nsouthern halves of all the great peninsulas. Quite generally, however,\r\nwe may say that the northern limit of the Mediterranean region, in its\r\nwestern half, is defined by the occurrence of considerable summer rain.\r\nThat is, it is bounded to the north by a region which is within reach of\r\nthe rain-bringing anti-trades in summer as well as in winter, and which\r\nhas a lower temperature than the Mediterranean region proper. To the\r\neast the region is limited by deserts, for the westerlies of winter can\r\nonly carry their moisture a certain distance inwards, and though they\r\nare greatly assisted by the long, eastward-stretching, inland sea, yet\r\nthere comes a time when all their load of moisture is lost, and desert\r\nconditions supervene.\r\n\r\nTo the south the desert again forms the boundary, though here for a\r\ndifferent cause. North Africa behind the Atlas is permanently within the\r\ntrade-wind belt, that is, it is permanently subjected to the action of\r\ndrying winds, and its rainfall is therefore small or nil. Similarly in\r\nCalifornia the southern limit of the Mediterranean zone of climate is\r\nthe desert region of Arizona, Mexico, and the north of Lower California.\r\nA similar band of desert separates the Mediterranean zone from the\r\ntropical region of summer rain in the other places where the\r\nMediterranean type occurs.\r\n\r\nThis may be summed up as follows:--Defining the Mediterranean climate\r\nonly by its rainfall, we may say that it prevails over lands both to the\r\nnorth and south of that sea, and these have all or most of their\r\nrainfall in winter, when the winds, though typically westerly, are often\r\nstormy and rendered variable by local conditions. In the summer there\r\nmay be no rain at all, or, to the north, small amounts. To the north the\r\nregion passes gradually into that colder zone where rain occurs\r\nabundantly both in summer and winter, while to the east and south the\r\nrainfall diminishes greatly, and there is a gradual transition to desert\r\nconditions. To the west the boundary of the region is theoretically the\r\nocean, but the western coastline owes to its peculiar position a more\r\nabundant precipitation, which makes the vegetation of, _e. g._, Portugal\r\npresent quite a different appearance from that of southern Italy or\r\nAlgiers. These peculiarities of rainfall the region owes to its position\r\nbetween two great wind systems, of which one gains the mastery in winter\r\nand the other in summer.\r\n\r\nSo far in this discussion we have spoken only of the distribution of the\r\nrainfall throughout the year, but there are other features of the\r\nMediterranean climate which are almost as important in considering the\r\neffects of the climate on the life of the region. These are the amount\r\nof the rainfall, and the temperature.\r\n\r\nBeginning with general points, it is very important to notice that the\r\nrainfall throughout the area as a whole is relatively scanty, except\r\nwhere special conditions, _e. g._ great elevation, or local\r\nrain-bringing winds, increase it. Translated into terms of plant life\r\nthis means that continuous forests of the type so characteristic of the\r\ngreater part of Europe till man interfered, are relatively rare within\r\nthe limits of the Mediterranean region. Looking at the same fact from\r\nthe human standpoint we may say that the rainfall is often so scanty\r\nthat irrigation is necessary before man can prosper. These two facts,\r\nthat Mediterranean man had not to clear forests before he planted and\r\nsowed, as the Teutons were obliged to do, and that he had often to bring\r\nwater artificially before his crops would grow, have been of supreme\r\nimportance in the evolution of Mediterranean civilisation. Even at this\r\nstage it is interesting to note that France in this, as in many other\r\nrespects, has shared in two civilisations, for her territory to the\r\nsouth shows Mediterranean characters, and elsewhere resembles the cool\r\ntemperate zone of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe next general point of importance is that of temperature. As was to\r\nbe expected from its latitude the basin of the Mediterranean is a\r\nrelatively warm region. Local conditions, and especially the presence of\r\na great mass of water, make the winter exceptionally mild, while the\r\nsummers, though not excessively hot they are considerably cooler than\r\nthose of similar latitudes in Asia, are yet warm and sunny. The result\r\nis that, given water artificially supplied, or given crops which can\r\ntake water from the deeper layers of the soil, the region is productive,\r\nthe destructive frost of the north not being a menace. This relative\r\neasiness of life in the more favoured parts of the region has been of\r\ngreat importance in its history.\r\n\r\nWe may give next some actual figures to illustrate what has been said\r\nabout temperature and rainfall. Let us begin with rainfall, and in order\r\nto have a basis of comparison we may first note that Edinburgh has a\r\nmean annual rainfall of about 28 inches, and London one of about 25\r\ninches. In other words, when the total amount of rain which falls in any\r\none year is estimated for many years in either of these places, these\r\ntotals added together and divided by the number of years of observation,\r\nthe quotient is the figure given. The figures show that the rainfall in\r\nLondon is less than that in Edinburgh, while in Paris it is less than in\r\neither.\r\n\r\nPassing now to consider the Mediterranean area we find that, speaking\r\ngenerally, the rainfall diminishes, for the reasons already explained,\r\nin passing from west to east, and in passing from north to south. Thus\r\nGibraltar, at one end of the basin has a fall of 32\" per annum, as\r\ncompared with one of 15\" at Athens near the other extremity. Genoa in\r\nthe north has the heavy fall of 51\", while Biskra in Algiers has only\r\n8\".\r\n\r\nThere are many local variations, due to local causes, and in comparing\r\nthe falls with those of Edinburgh and London we must remember that the\r\nhigher temperatures mean much greater evaporation. Sunny Naples has\r\nabout 4\" more rain in the year than Edinburgh, and has 7\" more than\r\nfoggy London, but yet has not a wet climate.\r\n\r\nFor temperatures a few figures may suffice. In London the mean January\r\ntemperature is 39° F., while it is only 36° F. at Paris. In Nice the\r\nmean January temperature is 45°, which is about the same as that of\r\nAthens, and rather less than that of Naples. In January, then, the\r\ntemperature of Nice is only 6° higher than that of London. In July the\r\nmean temperature at London is 62°, as against 73° at Nice and over 80°\r\nat Athens. In other words, owing to our mild winters and cool summers,\r\nthere is far more difference between British and Mediterranean\r\ntemperatures in summer than in winter. In the Mediterranean region\r\nitself the difference between the temperatures of summer and winter\r\nincreases as we pass eastwards, so that it is especially to the west\r\nthat characteristically Mediterranean conditions occur, _i. e._ mild,\r\nfrost-free winters, and summers which for the latitude are not\r\nexcessively hot. This feature also has been of importance in the\r\ndevelopment of the Mediterranean civilisations.\r\n\r\nWe have treated the climate of the Mediterranean area in some detail, as\r\nan example of the methods and results of modern climatology. We may note\r\nmuch more briefly the characteristics of one or two other climatic\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nMediterranean influences, expressed in winter rains, are continued\r\neastward into Mesopotamia and even into Persia, the rain always becoming\r\nscantier, and desert conditions tending to supervene. Still further\r\neast, however, we come to a region where the rainfall is abundant, and\r\nwhere the population is once more dense. These are the monsoon\r\ncountries, including India and China, where the usually plentiful\r\nrainfall again permits the land to nourish man abundantly.\r\n\r\nExcluding Africa south of the Sahara from consideration, we may indeed\r\nsay that the Old World has two regions of abundant rainfall and dense\r\npopulation, the one to the west and the other to the south-east,\r\nseparated from each other by warm and cold deserts. Each of these two\r\nregions has given rise to its own civilisation, each has produced its\r\nown types of cultivated plants and domestic animals, and the root\r\ndifferences between the two must be regarded as largely the result of\r\nclimatic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe monsoon countries are so named because of the regular seasonal\r\nreversal of the winds, which blow from land to sea in winter and from\r\nsea to land in summer, affording an example of a land and sea breeze on\r\nthe gigantic scale. The result is that, subject to local modifications,\r\nthe summer winds are moisture-bringing, and the winter winds are dry.\r\nWhereas, then, in the Mediterranean the heat of summer is largely\r\nwasted, from the agriculturist's point of view, on account of the\r\nscarcity of the water necessary for growth, in monsoon regions, unless\r\nthe rain fail, as it sometimes does, the hot season is the moist season,\r\nand, therefore, other things being equal, growth must be faster here\r\nthan in the Mediterranean area. The monsoon countries extend over a\r\ngreat stretch of latitude, and therefore temperature conditions vary\r\ngreatly, while the great variety of surface-relief produces here\r\nabnormally heavy rainfall, and there desert conditions. The essential\r\ncontrast with the Mediterranean type is, however, the summer rainfall.\r\n\r\nTaking the globe as a whole we find that summer rainfall is more common\r\nthan winter, and in addition to occurring in monsoon regions, it tends\r\nto occur in tropical regions generally. As we approach the equator from\r\nthe tropics we find that the total fall increases, and tends to show two\r\nmaxima, which occur when the sun is overhead, _i. e._ at the equinoxes.\r\nFor our particular purpose, however, the climatic conditions in tropical\r\nand equatorial regions generally, though of great importance to the\r\nclimatologist, are not of great interest, for except in monsoon\r\ncountries the hot parts of the earth do not show the most highly\r\ndeveloped human societies.\r\n\r\nLet us turn next to that part of Europe which is outside the reach of\r\nMediterranean influences. Here we find that the rain is distributed\r\nthroughout the year, and is usually abundant, though it decreases in\r\npassing eastwards from the seaboard. Temperatures are naturally lower\r\nthan in the Mediterranean basin, and winter frost plays an important\r\npart in determining the choice of cultivated plants. As the figures\r\nwhich we have already quoted for London and Paris suggest, the winter\r\ncold increases on passing eastward. Paris is colder in winter than\r\nLondon, though it lies south of it. Vienna is again colder than Paris.\r\nBut the increase in winter cold is compensated for by an increase in the\r\nsummer heat. In other words, as the distance from the sea increases in\r\nEurope the climate becomes drier and more extreme.\r\n\r\nThis observation naturally leads up to a consideration of the effect of\r\nthe proximity of the sea upon climate. Water heats more slowly than\r\nland, but also cools more slowly, and therefore the proximity of large\r\nmasses of water has, speaking generally, a moderating influence upon\r\nclimate, producing the so-called maritime climate. In the case of the\r\nBritish Isles this effect is very marked, because the ocean to the west\r\nof us is unusually warm, and the circulation of the atmosphere is such\r\nthat the prevailing winds of winter blow towards us from the warmer\r\nparts of this ocean, while the fact that the summer winds often have a\r\nnortherly component helps to keep the summer temperatures down.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar conditions of the British Islands illustrate the fact that\r\nclimate does not depend upon latitude alone, but may be greatly modified\r\nby local conditions, especially by the distribution of land and water,\r\nand the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\nLet us now sum up what has been said in regard to the main types of\r\nclimate found in Europe. Round the Mediterranean basin we have an area\r\nwith mild winters and warm summers, where the rain tends to fall during\r\nthe winter season, making summer a period of drought. This climate\r\nextends beyond the limits of Europe into Northern Africa and Western\r\nAsia, and is separated from the regions of tropical climate, which have\r\nno winter and have rains at the hottest season, by a belt of desert.\r\n\r\nThe western seaboard of Europe has a maritime climate, the sea tempering\r\nthe winter, but diminishing the summer heat. The prevailing winds are\r\nwesterly, and the rainfall is typically abundant and distributed\r\nthroughout the year. On passing inwards this type of climate changes\r\ninto the continental type, with cold winters and hot summers, and\r\ndiminishing rainfall. Though precipitation occurs at all seasons of the\r\nyear, it tends to be greatest in summer, giving, _e. g._ in parts of the\r\nBalkan States, a type eminently suited to the cereal maize, which needs\r\nmore summer rain than wheat.\r\n\r\nIf we bear in mind that North America is a large continent, and Europe a\r\nvery small one, and that while Europe has no eastern seaboard, it is the\r\neastern seaboard of America which faces Europe, we may realise that the\r\nclimates of North America show a remarkable analogy to the European. On\r\nthe western side we have in British Columbia and California respectively\r\nthe same two types of maritime climate which occur in Europe, that is,\r\nBritish Columbia has a mild equable climate with abundant and equally\r\ndistributed rainfall, and California has a Mediterranean climate.\r\n\r\nAt the eastern side the conditions are a little different, and show us\r\nthat the mere presence of the sea is not sufficient to produce a\r\n\"maritime\" climate. The prevailing winds in eastern North America are\r\noff the shore; they cannot therefore carry oceanic influences landwards.\r\nTo the north the winds tend to have a northerly component, and cold\r\ncurrents of water also stream out of the Arctic and chill eastern North\r\nAmerica. The result is that we find that Labrador, though lying in the\r\nlatitude of Great Britain, has a very severe climate. Further south the\r\nconditions are of the \"continental\" character even on the seaboard, the\r\nwinters being very cold and the summers hot. Rainfall is equally\r\ndistributed throughout the year, but on passing inland it diminishes in\r\namount and tends to be limited to the warm season. The diminution would\r\nbe much more obvious than it actually is were it not that the existence\r\nof the large Gulf of Mexico, and also the size of the North American\r\ncontinent, give rise in the south to a monsoon effect, which greatly\r\nincreases the rainfall of the south-eastern corner of the States.\r\nFurther to the west, in the lee of the great barrier of the Rocky\r\nMountains, the rainfall is slight.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, we may notice that the eastern seaboard of the great\r\nEurasian continent also has a more extreme climate than the western,\r\noffering in this respect an analogy to the conditions which prevail on\r\nthe eastern and western halves of temperate North America. The cause in\r\nboth cases is the same--the direction of the prevailing winds.\r\n\r\nWe cannot close this chapter without some reference to weather, a\r\nsubject of more geographical importance than is generally realised. In\r\nspeaking of climate we have used figures which were invariably _means_,\r\n_i. e._ have been obtained by averaging a great number of observations.\r\nBut where a great number of mean figures are used in a discussion, it is\r\nalways found that the different averages are based upon varying numbers\r\nof observations, and are therefore not strictly comparable with one\r\nanother. There is always a risk that such figures may mask facts of real\r\ngeographical importance. No doubt some of the difficulties will\r\ndisappear with the progress of meteorological science, which will enable\r\nthe geographer only to select figures which are strictly comparable.\r\nMeantime, however, observations for long periods are rare, and the\r\nmeteorologist must be content to take the figures which are available.\r\nFor this reason as well as for others, it is advisable to add to the\r\nsomewhat abstract study of means, that is, of climate, some note upon\r\nthe actual conditions, that is, upon weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Diagram to illustrate a cyclone travelling\r\ntowards the east. The two concentric circles represent isobars, that is,\r\nthey are lines drawn through points where the barometer registers the\r\nsame (low) pressure. Into the area of low pressure so formed the winds\r\nblow strongly in the direction known as counterclockwise, and are\r\nrepresented by the arrows whose double barbs signify their strength. It\r\nwill be noted that in the rear of the cyclone the winds are northerly.\r\nThey thus chill the air here, and by chilling it _raise_ the pressure.\r\nThe winds to the front of the cyclone are warm because southerly, they\r\ntherefore tend to _lower_ the pressure here by warming the air, and the\r\nresult is that the isobars tend to be displaced towards the east, and at\r\nthe same time become deformed. In other words, the cyclone moves to the\r\neast.]\r\n\r\nWe may take British weather, which has become a proverb on account of\r\nits variableness, as a text for a brief discussion of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe daily variations in our weather, as all who have read weather\r\nreports know, are chiefly determined by the movements of areas of low\r\npressure or cyclones, which mostly come to us from the Atlantic, and\r\ncontinue eastwards past us, often towards the Baltic. We have already\r\nnoted the occurrence of what we have called a permanent area of low\r\npressure in the North Atlantic, but this \"permanent area\" in point of\r\nfact is due chiefly to the constant passage here of cyclones, or moving\r\nareas of low pressure.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the eastward displacement of these depressions are\r\ninteresting. One cause is the general eastward movement of the\r\natmosphere in this region, produced in the fashion already described.\r\nThis movement necessarily raises the pressure to the west of the\r\ndepression, owing to the influx of fresh air, while the onward movement\r\nof the air in front of the depression lowers the pressure there, and so\r\nproduces displacement. Again, the air is sucked into a depression in the\r\ndirection opposite to the hands of a clock, and a moment's reflection\r\nwill show that this means that the winds to the east of the depression\r\nare southerly and those to the west of it northerly. The warm southerly\r\nwinds in front tend to lower the pressure by warming the air, while the\r\ncold northerly winds behind it raise the pressure by cooling the air.\r\nThis again produces a displacement of the depression towards the east\r\n(see fig. 10).\r\n\r\nThe fact just described has an interesting practical result. If after a\r\nday or night of storm and rain, the temperature falls, we know that the\r\ndepression causing the storm has passed us, and that we are feeling the\r\neffects of the colder winds in its rear. If the thermometer suddenly\r\nrises again, then a new depression is approaching, and we are feeling\r\nits warm breath before its winds reach us. The clearness and chilliness\r\nof the air after a stormy or windy period gives us one of our commonest\r\nmeteorological sensations, and produces a marked psychical effect,\r\nreflected in much of our literature.\r\n\r\nOne other reason for the eastward motion of the cyclones with us is that\r\nthey seem to prefer damp air, and so tend to follow the North Sea and\r\npass towards the Baltic, where they often die away.\r\n\r\nIn the British area, though the depressions move faster in winter than\r\nin summer, they have only a mean speed of about 16 miles an hour, while\r\nin the United States their mean speed is 25 miles per hour, and their\r\neffects are often disastrous except when discounted by the warnings of\r\nthe Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the British Isles cyclones are most frequent and best\r\nmarked in winter, and they are of great importance in producing our mild\r\nand windy winters. In summer they travel further northwards, and as a\r\nrule affect our climate less. When, however, from causes still\r\ninadequately known, they are better marked in summer than usual, we have\r\na \"bad\" summer, that is, one which is wet and relatively windy.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the English Channel is one of the favourite tracks of\r\ncyclones has been an important element in protecting the British Islands\r\nfrom foreign invasion, while we all know that it is also a factor in\r\ndiminishing free intercourse with the Continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Diagram showing the changes in temperature,\r\npressure and wind due to a cyclone passing to the north of a point of\r\nobservation A. The passage of the cyclone figured occupied a period of\r\nsix days. It will be noted that as it approaches A the wind is southerly\r\nand light (arrows with single barbs) and the temperature high. As it\r\npasses the winds become violent (arrows with double barbs), and shift to\r\nthe south-west, and the barometer falls rapidly. As it disappears the\r\npressure rises, the temperature falls, and the wind veers to the\r\nnorth-west, while remaining violent. The fall of the wind and its\r\nshifting to a south-westerly direction mark the return to the normal\r\ncondition of affairs, the influence of the cyclone being past.]\r\n\r\nThe second point of importance about our weather is the periodic\r\noccurrence at some part of our area of anticyclones, or areas of high\r\npressure, out of which the winds stream gently in the same direction as\r\nthe hands of the clock. These areas of high pressure do not display\r\nthe same tendency to move as do the cyclones, and are most frequently\r\nmerely displaced by advancing cyclones. For reasons into which space\r\ndoes not permit us to go fully here, anticyclones have a very different\r\neffect in summer and in winter. In winter they may bring to us the\r\ncontinental cold, and make our weather abnormally severe, though often\r\nbright and fine. On the other hand, in summer they bring to us\r\ncontinental warmth, so that \"good\" summers are those in which\r\nanticyclonic conditions are most frequent, while \"severe\" winters are\r\ndue to the same cause. Anticyclones also sometimes induce a curious form\r\nof inversion, in that places to the north of a given spot may have\r\ntemporarily a higher temperature than places to the south. It is such\r\nfacts which are entirely masked by \"mean\" figures.\r\n\r\nWe do not as yet understand the causes which make cyclones sometimes\r\nmore numerous or better marked than usual, which cause them sometimes to\r\ncross our area, and at other times to travel too far north or too far\r\nsouth to influence our weather. It is possible that further\r\ninvestigation in the future may unravel this problem; it is practically\r\ncertain that a freer use of wireless telegraphy, and the establishing of\r\nmeteorological stations in northern seas, would give weather forecasting\r\na definiteness and accuracy which it does not yet possess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--British weather map for Nov. 29, 1910. A\r\ncyclone lies over the south of Scandinavia, and into it the winds are\r\nsweeping strongly in a counterclockwise direction. An anticyclone lies\r\nover Iceland, and from it the winds are streaming gently in a clockwise\r\ndirection.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot follow this interesting subject further here, but we have\r\nsaid enough to illustrate its geographical significance. As a science or\r\nsub-science by itself it will form the subject of a special volume in\r\nthis series. It may be enough to point out that the _Daily Weather\r\nReport_, published by the Meteorological Office at a cost of one penny,\r\nand reproduced in some daily newspapers, is a document well worth the\r\ncareful study of those with any interest in geography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLES OF PLANT GEOGRAPHY AND THE CHIEF PLANT FORMATIONS OF\r\nEUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now taken a general survey of the earth's surface, have noted\r\nits mountain heights and its ocean depths, watched the formation of\r\nhills and valleys which is due to the joint action of atmospheric\r\nagents, running water and ice, and considered briefly some of the points\r\nof interest about climate. We next pass to that most characteristic\r\nfeature of the surface, its clothing of plants. Except where the surface\r\nof the ground has been artificially sterilised by man, or is rendered\r\nunproductive by ice, by lava, by a total lack of water, or by the\r\nexistence of poisonous salts, it is clothed with vegetation, and it is\r\nthe presence of this vegetation which is its most obvious character.\r\n\r\nHere, however, as in other regions of thought, the geographical\r\nstandpoint has only been reached slowly. Man's habit of analysis made\r\nhim study grasses and trees for long generations before he got back to\r\nthe forest and to the grassland as they occur in nature. Plants as\r\nindividuals are the province of the botanist, but those plant groups\r\nwhich are the expression of the interaction of climatic factors, soil,\r\nand surface relief, are the concern of the geographer.\r\n\r\nWhen we take a general survey of the face of the earth from the point of\r\nview of plant geography, we note three main conditions. In certain\r\nregions, alike in the tropics and in temperate zones, we find that\r\nplants reach their maximum size, combined with great differentiation of\r\nstructure, and the formation of woody stems which offer great resistance\r\nto varying conditions of climate and weather. Such highly-organised\r\nplants form forests, which still dominate over a large part of the\r\nearth's surface.\r\n\r\nMan's nearest allies, the anthropoid apes and the monkeys, are for the\r\nmost part forest animals, and the lowest races of men are still forest\r\ndwellers. Where man is a forest dweller he seems not to reach his full\r\nsize, as we see in the case of the pigmies of the Congo forest, and the\r\nnegritos of the Philippines, and he suffers from a chronic insufficiency\r\nof food, which acts as a check both to his mental and physical\r\ndevelopment. There has, therefore, always been war between evolving man\r\nand the giants of the plant world, a war which has swept the forests\r\naway from many of the more civilised parts of the globe, and which still\r\ncontinues, though man's victory is now so complete that he can afford to\r\nbe generous, and give protection to the remnants of his former foe.\r\n\r\nBut over parts of the globe the climate, and especially the amount or\r\ndistribution of the rainfall, makes it difficult or impossible for\r\nforests to grow naturally. Here other types of plants, lower in stature,\r\nand evading rather than facing the problems of winter cold or summer\r\ndrought, flourish and form what we call the grasslands. The grasslands\r\nfavour man in several respects. They feed the animals upon which he\r\ndepends for food, for clothing, and for the conveyance of his person or\r\nproperty, and they offer much less resistance than the forest to his\r\nagricultural operations. Even the large herbivorous mammals which in\r\ntheir wild state haunt the forests, usually leave these at night to\r\nfeed upon the grasslands, so that it is the grasslands which have\r\nlargely fed man at every stage of civilisation. The atmospheric\r\nconditions within the woodlands also, the deficient sunlight, the\r\nhumidity, and so forth, seem unfavourable to human development.\r\n\r\nWhere the conditions are especially unfavourable to plant life, we find\r\nthat even the grassland plants are unable to keep up the struggle, and\r\ndiminish in number, losing their power of forming a complete covering\r\nfor the soil, and thus the grassland passes into desert, whether the hot\r\nwaterless desert of low latitudes, or the cold frozen desert of northern\r\nones.\r\n\r\nIn the most general sense, then, we may say that these three formations,\r\nwoodland, grassland and desert, divide the surface of the land among\r\nthem, and between them there is constant conflict. The grasslands are\r\nfor ever attempting to encroach upon the woodlands, and in this attempt\r\nthey have been assisted, sometimes to too great an extent, by the\r\noperations of man. Similarly the desert is always striving to encroach\r\nupon the grassland, and in this endeavour it has been sometimes\r\ninvoluntarily aided by man, who has also done much voluntarily to\r\nreclaim the desert land for the grasses.\r\n\r\nLet us note next the particular conditions which favour woodland,\r\ngrassland and desert respectively. The distribution of plants over the\r\nsurface of the earth at large is determined by a number of factors, by\r\nthe amount of heat, by the amount and distribution of precipitation, by\r\nthe nature and strength of the winds, by the characters of the soil, and\r\nso on. But forests occur under the equator and also far to the north; we\r\nhave cold deserts as well as hot ones; there are extensive grasslands in\r\nthe Sudan as well as in the Canadian Far West. This proves that the\r\nvarying amounts of heat may be neglected in considering the cause of the\r\ndistribution of the three great plant formations.\r\n\r\nAgain, the soil is of minor importance, for different types of forest\r\nand of grassland occur on different types of soils. We are thus led to\r\nthe conclusion that it is the precipitation and the wind which determine\r\nthe distribution. To understand the reason for this we must consider the\r\nneeds of different types of plants in the matter of water.\r\n\r\nPlants can only take in the mineral constituents of their food in the\r\nform of a solution, and this solution must be weak, or it has a\r\npoisonous effect. For example, sulphate of ammonia is a valuable manure,\r\nbut if a considerable amount be dissolved in water and applied to the\r\nroots of a growing plant, death may very likely take place.\r\n\r\nIt is a necessary consequence of the fact that plants can only absorb\r\nweak solutions of their food salts, that their roots take in more water\r\nthan is actually needed by the plant. _One_ of the functions of the\r\nleaves is therefore to get rid of surplus water, the process being\r\ncalled transpiration. Transpiration takes place faster in a tall plant\r\nlike a tree, which grows up into dry layers of the air, than in a low\r\nplant like a grass. It takes place faster in windy weather than in calm.\r\nOther things being equal it takes place faster in warm weather than in\r\ncold, and the larger the plant and the more numerous its leaves the more\r\nwater is given off, that is, the more water is returned to the air from\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this is that forest trees require far more water than\r\ngrassland. It has been calculated that a beech wood aged 50 to 60 years\r\ngives off during the growing season 354 tons of water per acre, which\r\nillustrates the drying effect of the presence of the wood. Similarly,\r\nthe effect of tree-planting in the marshy regions of France and Italy,\r\nwhere the soil as a consequence has dried and the marshes disappeared,\r\nshows how great a demand upon ground water trees make, as compared with\r\ngrasses and low growing herbs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, although trees take an enormous amount of water from\r\nthe soil, they can draw their supplies from a large area. It is the\r\nextremities of the fine branches of the roots which take in the water,\r\nand these pass deep down into the soil, and spread out over a vast area.\r\nIn other words, trees avail themselves of the water in the deeper layers\r\nof the soil, and can tolerate relatively long periods of drought, if the\r\nsurface drying of the soil does not extend to the deeper layers. In hot\r\nsummer weather grasslands brown and wither long before the trees show\r\nany signs of water-famine.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, we may say that as long as the total rainfall of a\r\nregion is sufficient to ensure a constant supply of moisture in the\r\nsubsoil during the growing season, trees can thrive, even if little or\r\nno rain falls during this season. On the other hand, drying winds are\r\nvery hurtful to trees, especially if they occur at a period when the\r\ntree is unable, either because of the coldness of the subsoil, or\r\nbecause of its dryness, to take in fresh water to replace that which is\r\nlost. The hurtfulness of late frosts is largely due to the cold suddenly\r\nchecking root absorption at a time when the growing parts, acted upon by\r\nthe spring winds, are giving out water freely.\r\n\r\nGrasses transpire less freely than trees, but their root system is much\r\nshallower and less well-developed. They depend upon the water in the\r\nupper layers of soil, and must have frequent, even if gentle, showers\r\nduring their growing season, while they are quite indifferent to drought\r\nand even to cutting winds during their resting period.\r\n\r\nA little reflection will show that it results from these facts that\r\nwoodland, grassland and desert do not form a continuous series. It may\r\nquite well be that woodland passes through scrub into desert without the\r\nintervention of grassland. Right across Europe there is (or was) a broad\r\nbelt of forest. Southward towards the Mediterranean this thins out into\r\na characteristic form of scrub, called maquis, whose characters we\r\nshall describe later, and this scrub passes in all directions into\r\ndesert land. Here no belt of grassland intervenes, for the rainless\r\nMediterranean summer makes the growth of grass virtually impossible,\r\nexcept where special conditions, _e. g._ hills, introduce modifications.\r\nContrasted with this we have the conditions in North America where,\r\n_e. g._ in Canada, the western coast is densely forest-clad, as is also\r\nthe eastern region. In journeying eastward after crossing the Rocky\r\nMountains the forest dies away into grassland, and the same thing\r\nhappens, though more slowly, in a westward journey. The reason is that\r\nin this case there is a steady diminution of precipitation on passing to\r\nthe interior, but what precipitation remains is, as we have seen,\r\nlargely, though not wholly, summer rain, and is, therefore, sufficient\r\nto determine the growth of grass, though not of trees.\r\n\r\nAgain, in North Africa the forests of the Atlas Mountains pass directly,\r\nwithout intervening grassland, into the Sahara desert, but to the south\r\nof the desert the grassy and park-like Sudan separates the desert from\r\nthe luxuriant tropical forest. In the latter case, however, it is\r\npossible that man's influence has counted for something.\r\n\r\nOn mountains, in whatever latitude, the conditions are much more\r\nuniform, partly because it is wind, assisted by temperature variations,\r\nwhich is the dominating factor. Moisture is usually abundant, but high\r\nup what is called physiological drought occurs; that is, the temperature\r\nis too low for the plants to be able to absorb the abundant water.\r\n\r\nIn ascending any mountain, the following are the chief changes which\r\noccur. The lower slopes will probably be cultivated. As we ascend the\r\nprecipitation increases, and forests appear. First we have probably a\r\nbelt of deciduous trees, passing above into the more resistant conifers.\r\nThis belt usually ascends higher on the south than on the north side,\r\nand higher on mountains which occur in a group than on isolated peaks.\r\nAs the wind is more and more felt, and increases the dangerous\r\ntranspiration of winter the trees become more and more dwarfed to escape\r\nits force. There may be a belt of prostrate mountain pines above,\r\nmarking the tree limit; in any case the trees are gradually replaced by\r\ndwarfed shrubs. Then comes the zone of Alpine plants, the grasses\r\nmaking a complete sward, but being accompanied by many other plants.\r\nGradually, as the soil becomes scantier, and the surface more rocky and\r\nexposed, the continuous sward disappears, and the conditions of a cold\r\ndesert appear. A few scattered plants occur, ceasing near the snow-line,\r\nthe highest being usually plants of simple structure like mosses and\r\nlichens.\r\n\r\nAs we have already indicated, in the case of the mountains of Europe\r\nthere are often glacial shelves at considerable elevations, whose\r\ncovering of fine débris determines the growth of peculiarly fine grass.\r\nThe economic value of this grassland has in many cases in the Alps\r\ninduced man to destroy the forest in order to increase pasture land. The\r\nresult has often been disastrous, for once the trees are cut down the\r\nforest soil is rapidly destroyed by weathering, especially on slopes,\r\nthe courses of streams are altered by the more rapid run-off, and\r\nwidespread flooding and destruction of pastures have sometimes resulted.\r\nIn North America, similarly, man's attempt to increase pasture land or\r\narable land at the expense of woodland has often led to disastrous\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the special features of the Mediterranean\r\nclimate, and indicated that its peculiarities are reflected in its\r\nvegetation; we must now consider this vegetation in a little more\r\ndetail. The fact that the region is chiefly visited by the inhabitants\r\nof more northern climates in spring gives rise to a somewhat erroneous\r\nimpression in regard to the plants. In spring the Mediterranean\r\nvegetation is at its best. The mild winters permit the plants which\r\nfurther north die down or cease to grow, to go on blooming. The rains so\r\nmoisten the soil that the first warm days cause very rapid growth in\r\nthose plants which finish their activities before the hot, dry summer\r\nbegins. They must flower and seed in spring, and die down till the rains\r\nof autumn awaken them again.\r\n\r\nIn our own country we have a few plants which hurry through their\r\nactivities in this way. The lesser celandine, the wood anemone and a few\r\nothers strive to flower and fruit before the forest trees are thickly\r\nclad with leaves. The snowdrop, even the wild hyacinth, though it is\r\nmuch later, similarly limit their active life to a short period in\r\nspring. This phenomenon, only suggested in our climate, is very marked\r\nin the Mediterranean area.\r\n\r\nThat region is especially characterised by its richness in bulbous and\r\ntuberous plants. These, as all who have grown hyacinths or narcissuses\r\nknow, demand relatively large amounts of water during their short\r\ngrowing period. In spring, therefore, the shores of the Mediterranean\r\nare bright with many kinds of anemones, with narcissus, asphodel, bell\r\nhyacinth, Allium, tulips, and so on, all awakened by the spring warmth\r\nand the spring rains. Accompanying them are many bright-coloured\r\nannuals, also in a hurry to race through their life-history before the\r\nterrible drought of summer. Now also the grass grows, and the\r\nautumn-sown corn becomes tall. As the weather grows hotter and drier,\r\nthe plants with bulbous and tuberous roots die down to the ground, the\r\nannuals die altogether, leaving their seeds to wait till the autumn\r\nrains before they sprout. The grasses turn brown, and the peculiar\r\nparched appearance of the Mediterranean summer spreads over the land.\r\n\r\nTo a northern visitor at this season it is not luxuriance but desolation\r\nwhich is the prevailing note. Except on the hill slopes there are no\r\nmasses of broad-leafed foliage trees--there is not the deep bright green\r\ncharacteristic of the summer woods further north. The trees do not reach\r\na great size; the leaves are usually small, and the fact that they\r\nstrive to avoid the sun by arranging themselves with the edge upwards\r\ninstead of the flat surface, makes them appear smaller than they are.\r\nThey are often needle-shaped, sometimes shining and coated with resin,\r\nsometimes silvery owing to a coating of hairs on the under surface. Many\r\nplants have spines or thorns, and succulent plants like agave, aloe and\r\nprickly pear are common. The absence of a complete covering of\r\nvegetation causes the surface soil to dry completely, and so form clouds\r\nof dust which adds to the generally desolate appearance. Indeed, the\r\nbrown powdery appearance of the soil is one of the points which\r\nespecially strikes the stranger, accustomed to the darker, moister soil\r\nof the north, always covered with vegetation, except where man has\r\ninterfered.\r\n\r\nHere and there, however, are indications that even this parched brown\r\nearth holds wealth for man. The vines, if dusty and far less luxuriant\r\nthan one expects, are loaded with ripening fruit. The gorgeous scarlet\r\nflowers of the double pomegranate gleam amid the dark foliage; the\r\ngnarled and twisted olives show on close inspection masses of small\r\ngreen fruits; the oleander bushes are covered with pink flowers; there\r\nare great round balls on the orange and lemon trees, and many other\r\nfruit trees are loaded with produce.\r\n\r\nLet us sum up first what man gains from the plants of the Mediterranean,\r\nand then look at some points in regard to the wild plants. In the first\r\nplace, we see that man takes advantage of the rapid growth of annuals in\r\nthe early part of the year. The annuals most useful to him, here as\r\nelsewhere, are, of course, the cereals, especially wheat, which, if sown\r\nin autumn, is nourished by the winter rains, and grows rapidly with the\r\nwarmth of spring to ripen in May, June or July, according to the\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, certain trees or shrubs, by reason of their\r\nresistance to drought, and their elaborate root system, which enables\r\nthem to gather water from the deeper layers of the soil, will produce\r\nsucculent fruits without needing artificial supplies of water. The most\r\nimportant of these, throughout the whole Mediterranean area, are the\r\nvine and the olive. The olive supplies the oil which is all the more\r\nnecessary in that the absence of grass makes pastoral industries, and\r\ntherefore the production of cheese and butter difficult or impossible\r\nexcept in the high grounds, while the vine supplies the wine which with\r\nbread and oil form the essential parts of the diet of Mediterranean man.\r\n\r\nThe olive tree, which is indigenous, may be regarded as one of the most\r\ncharacteristic trees of the area, and it is interesting to note that the\r\nnovice not infrequently confuses it with another tree, almost as\r\ncharacteristic the evergreen or holm oak. The two are not nearly\r\nrelated, the olive belonging to the same family as the lilac and privet,\r\nwhile the evergreen oak is a true oak. Both trees, however, show similar\r\nadaptations to summer drought, and their resemblance to one another is a\r\ngood example of convergence due to a similar environment. Both have\r\nsmall evergreen leaves; small that they may not lose too much water in\r\nsummer, evergreen that they may assimilate even during the winter. Both\r\nhave their leaves silvery beneath, which again prevents loss of water;\r\nboth have gnarled trunks, branching low down, in order that the leaves\r\nmay avoid the dry upper layers of the air. Adaptations of this kind are\r\npresent to a greater or less degree in all the trees which are tolerant\r\nof Mediterranean conditions, and many of these trees yield useful\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the cultivated plants mentioned, a great number of others\r\nare grown within the area, as we shall see later, but the point of\r\ninterest is that the plants which have been of importance in the history\r\nof the region have been either annuals which ripened early, or\r\nfruit-bearing trees with special adaptations to resist drought.\r\n\r\nApart from the annuals and the bulbous and tuberous plants already\r\ndescribed, the wild plants are chiefly shrubs or stunted trees with\r\nsimilar drought-resisting characters. During the long ages he has\r\ninhabited the Mediterranean, man has doubtless contributed largely to\r\nthe destruction of the forests which are now, as we have seen,\r\nrepresented by the stunted scrub or maquis. But on climatic grounds we\r\ncannot suppose that the Mediterranean forests had ever the luxuriance of\r\nthose further north, or of the tropical forests of the south.\r\n\r\nWhere there is sufficient rain chestnut woods occur, but this is only\r\non the hill slopes. Above the chestnut, beech may occur, as in Sicily.\r\nThe maritime pine and the Corsican pine form open woods in the damper\r\nplaces, and the picturesque stone pine, with its rounded head, is very\r\ncharacteristic. We have already mentioned the evergreen or holm oak as\r\ncommon, and the cork oak occurs abundantly in some places. These trees,\r\nwith the cypress, must have formed the primitive forests, and they still\r\nconstitute the most important forest trees of the area. The occurrence\r\nof a native palm (_Chamærops_) is interesting as suggesting the warmth\r\nof the climate, and even on the European shores the date palm is\r\nextensively planted, though its true home is the margin of the African\r\nand Arabian deserts.\r\n\r\nOf the characteristic shrubs the most striking are perhaps the many\r\nspecies of Cistus, with large almost rose-like flowers, and leaves which\r\nattempt to adapt themselves to the climate by many different devices.\r\nSometimes they are stiff and leathery, sometimes resinous, sometimes\r\nhairy. Many plants in the area have a coating of resin on their leaves.\r\nThis, no doubt, preserves them against loss of water, but also probably\r\nprotects against grazing animals. Goats thrive in the Mediterranean\r\npartly because of the catholicity of their taste in vegetation, and in\r\nconsequence the plants have had to protect themselves against their\r\nappetite as well as against drought. Only those with some disagreeable\r\nquality, hairs, spines, resin, strong flavour, etc., could hope to\r\nprotect themselves in the dry season, when grass is virtually absent. It\r\nis in consequence common to find aromatic or strongly-flavoured plants\r\nwith glandular leaves; lavender, rosemary, myrtle, etc., are examples.\r\n\r\nOther shrubby plants associated with the Mediterranean are oleander, the\r\nnoble laurel, the tree heath, arbutus, many kinds of broom, and\r\ngenerally evergreen shrubs specially adapted to resist drought.\r\n\r\nLet us turn from this picture to the appearance presented by Central and\r\nNorthern Europe. As we have seen, the forest which once covered most of\r\nthe area, except the steppe region of southern Russia, has largely\r\ndisappeared, but enough remains to enable us to reconstruct the picture\r\nof the original forest.\r\n\r\nAs contrasted with the (chiefly) evergreen woodland of the\r\nMediterranean, the forests of the low grounds are here deciduous. In\r\nsummer clothed in magnificent foliage, well adapted to give off enormous\r\nquantities of water, in winter the trees stand tall and bare, exposing\r\nnothing but their branches to the winter blasts. While the buds of\r\nMediterranean plants have no special means of protection, the typical\r\nforest trees of Central Europe have their buds carefully sheathed in\r\nscales, clothed in hairs, or coated with resin, to keep out alike the\r\ncold and the damp of the northern winter. While the leaves of\r\nMediterranean plants are usually small, often coated with hairs beneath,\r\noften resinous, and so on, the forest trees further north have large\r\nleaves of delicate texture, with no special protection against drought.\r\n\r\nAgain, while the luxuriant forest of the tropics includes many different\r\nspecies of trees, the deciduous forests of cool temperate regions\r\ncontain few species, and are often pure woods, that is, consist of one\r\ndominant species, forming beech woods or oak woods, and so on. The dense\r\nshade of the beech makes undergrowth difficult or impossible, but the\r\nother woods have a complicated undergrowth of many different kinds of\r\nplants, especially pronounced in spring before the leaves appear on the\r\ntrees. But this undergrowth never reaches the luxuriance that it does in\r\nthe tropical forest, and creepers and climbing plants are few.\r\n\r\nAs we ascend from the low ground to the higher, or as we travel\r\nnorthwards to high latitudes, the broad-leafed deciduous forests are\r\nreplaced by coniferous ones. European conifers, with the exception of\r\nthe larch, are evergreen, and all are more tolerant of cold and wind\r\nthan deciduous trees. Pines, spruce, fir, larch, and silver fir are the\r\nmost important kinds. Both at high altitudes and in high latitudes these\r\nconifers are often accompanied by birch, which is not a cone-bearing\r\ntree, but is very tolerant of cold and wind.\r\n\r\nTo the north there comes sooner or later a limit beyond which the cold\r\nand winds make further tree growth impossible. Here we come to a tundra\r\nregion, where the place of trees is taken by low-growing shrubs, with\r\nsmall leaves and other adaptations to ensure against excessive loss of\r\nwater. It is, as it were, the reappearance of the Mediterranean type,\r\nbut here the cause is, not the absence of water, but the fact that the\r\ncold makes it impossible for the roots to absorb it. A condition of\r\nphysiological drought results, and only plants well adapted to prevent\r\nundue loss of water can resist such conditions of life.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar type of vegetation occurs over vast areas in the more\r\nnorthern parts of Europe, forming the moors and heaths of much of\r\nScotland, of parts of England and Ireland, of parts of Germany, and so\r\non. Here the presence of peat produces conditions very unfavourable to\r\nplant life, except to certain shrubby plants such as heather and other\r\nplants of the heather family, juniper, bog myrtle, and so on, and some\r\ngrasses and sedges, etc., all of which have special adaptations to life\r\nin a peaty soil. Over the large areas, therefore, covered by these\r\nheaths, trees are absent, or few, and this stunted shrubby vegetation\r\ntakes their place.\r\n\r\nLarge areas of natural grassland, except for the tracts of pasture land\r\nalready described in the mountain regions, are infrequent in Europe.\r\nThey occur in Southern Russia and in the Hungarian plain, and form part\r\nof that great series of steppes and plains which stretches into Asia,\r\nand passes into a region of deserts.\r\n\r\nThe conditions favourable to the growth of grass here, instead of\r\ntrees, seem to be purely climatic. Very important is the prevalence of\r\nstrong cold winds during winter, which is a period of drought. The\r\nscanty rains come in early summer, which suits grasses admirably, while\r\nthe total precipitation is too slight for trees. The summers are hot,\r\nand the rains cease early and give place to a period of drought, very\r\ninjurious to trees, while it injures the grasses little, owing to the\r\nfact that they have had time to make their growth.\r\n\r\nThe abundant natural growth of grass makes these steppe regions well\r\nsuited to the pastoral industries, which tend, as civilisation\r\nprogresses, to give place to agriculture.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we have seen that looking at Europe as a whole three great\r\nplant formations are represented. We have, first, the cool temperate\r\nforest, which once extended over the greater part of the continent,\r\nwherever the conditions were suitable. This has now largely given place\r\nto arable land. Next, we find round the Mediterranean sea, and in those\r\ngreat peninsulas and islands which are bathed by it, a zone of modified\r\nwoodland passing into scrub, remarkable for the rapid growth of annuals\r\nin the early part of the year, and for the abundance of trees bearing\r\nuseful fruits. Finally, linking Europe to temperate Asia, we have belts\r\nof steppe land, characterised by a luxuriant growth of grass in the\r\nearly summer, and fitted by nature for pastoral industries, which do not\r\nthrive near the Mediterranean. Another way of putting the same facts\r\nwould be to say that Europe proper is a region of temperate forest,\r\nlinked to Africa by scrub land passing into desert, and to Asia by\r\nsteppe land passing into desert.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe flora of North America, owing to the size of the continent, offers\r\nmore resemblance to that of Asia than to Europe.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind what has been already said about the structure of North\r\nAmerica--with its western mountain range and eastern uplands enclosing\r\nbetween them a region of moderate relief--and also what has been said in\r\nregard to its climates and to the influence of climate upon vegetation,\r\nit is relatively easy to deduce the main points in regard to the flora.\r\n\r\nTo the far north there is a treeless tundra region, quite comparable to\r\nthat which occurs over vast areas in North Asia, and on a reduced scale\r\nin the northern part of the continent of Europe. Next we have a wide\r\nband of predominantly coniferous forest, which, although its species are\r\ndifferent, yet in broad outline is entirely homologous with the\r\nconiferous forest found in northern Asia, south of the tundra region. In\r\nCanada this forest consists of spruces and larches, the species being\r\npeculiar to the continent. Mingled with the conifers are smaller numbers\r\nof the hardier deciduous trees, such as birches, poplars, and willows.\r\n\r\nWhat we have already said as to the climatic differences between the\r\neastern and western sides of continents will at once suggest that this\r\nband of forest is not likely to run directly across the continent from\r\neast to west. In point of fact it stretches from Labrador in a\r\nnorth-westerly direction to Alaska, leaving almost the whole of the\r\nwestern seaboard to be occupied by another type. This type is the\r\nextraordinarily luxuriant and beautiful western forest, consisting for\r\nthe most part of conifers. It is largely these conifers which have\r\nenriched European parks and gardens within recent years, and although it\r\nis perhaps the great _Sequoia_ (_Wellingtonia_) _gigantea_ which has\r\nmost impressed popular imagination, it must be remembered that size and\r\nluxuriance are characteristic of many species. This western forest\r\nstretches down the western seaboard to the State of California, and,\r\nindeed, persists until increasing aridity makes forest growth\r\nimpossible. Its great luxuriance, compared with the scantier forests of\r\nthe Mediterranean region in Europe, is partly to be ascribed to a\r\ngreater rainfall, and doubtless partly to man's interference, for the\r\noriginal forests of the Mediterranean must have been largely destroyed,\r\nas the western American forests are in process of being. One must\r\nremember also that the proximity of mountain ranges to the seaboard in\r\nwestern North America gives a heavy rainfall, and suitable places for\r\nforest growth. The fact that the trees are predominantly coniferous\r\ngives them great resistance to the summer drought. In front of the\r\nmountain ranges the coastal plain is occupied by an evergreen scrub\r\nvegetation comparable to that of the lowlands of the Mediterranean\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\nIn British Columbia, where the Cascade Range lies at no great distance\r\nfrom the Rocky Mountains, the western coniferous forest practically\r\nclothes the whole area from the coast to the main range, but further\r\nsouth, where the Cascade Range and its continuation the Sierra Nevada\r\nare widely separated from the main range, a dry and semi-desert region\r\noccurs, between the two, which bears a desert type of vegetation,\r\nincluding especially a plant related to our wormwood, called sagebrush,\r\nwith cactuses in the warmer parts. Another area which is too arid to\r\ncarry trees, except where local conditions raise the rainfall, extends\r\nfrom Texas northwards to about the latitude of Edmonton or Battleford,\r\nand lies in the \"rain shadow\" of the Rocky Mountains. This is the region\r\nof the Great Plains, mostly too arid to carry anything but herds of\r\ncattle, and mostly forming natural pasture, being thus analogous to the\r\nsteppes of Asia.\r\n\r\nEastward the rainfall increases, and we pass from the area of\r\nunreclaimed pasture to the prairies, now largely laid down to wheat and\r\nother food plants. Southward the Great Plains pass into the deserts of\r\nMexico, but northwards they are separated from the northern coniferous\r\nforest by a belt of aspen, and it is in this region that the Canadians\r\nare steadily pushing the cultivation of wheat into the plains, wherever\r\nthe local rainfall makes this possible.\r\n\r\nSo far we have left south-eastern Canada and the whole of the eastern\r\nand south-eastern States out of consideration. Speaking very broadly, we\r\nmay say that all this area is clothed by a forest of mixed coniferous\r\nand broad-leaved trees which is comparable to the forest which covers\r\nthe greater part of temperate Europe. But it is not to be expected that\r\na forest which extends from the northern shores of the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence to the extremity of the peninsula of Florida, that is, through\r\nabout 25 degrees of latitude, should be uniform throughout. In point of\r\nfact, botanists distinguish three separate zones. In south-eastern\r\nCanada and the New England states the Weymouth pine (_Pinus strobus_)\r\npredominates, being accompanied by limes, ashes, maples, oaks, elms,\r\nchestnuts, and so forth. Further south, and especially further west,\r\nextending to the Mississippi plains, there is a deciduous forest\r\nextraordinarily rich in species. Practically all our common genera of\r\nforest trees are represented, sometimes by very fine species, but in\r\naddition there are many genera with no European representatives. Very\r\nstriking is the abundance of magnolias (whence the name of magnolia\r\nforest sometimes given to this type), and species of the laurel family,\r\nas well as of liquidambar. The magnolias and liquidambar are especially\r\ninteresting, because they once occurred in Europe, their disappearance\r\nthere being probably caused by the glacial period as explained on p. 78.\r\n\r\nWe have emphasised above (p. 137) the luxuriance of the forests of the\r\nwest coast of the States, but it should be noticed that luxuriant as its\r\nconifers are, there is a remarkable poverty in broad-leaved forms, as\r\ncompared with these eastern forests, and this even in the warmer parts\r\nof the west coast. The reason is probably the same as in the\r\nMediterranean region in Europe. The existence of a belt of desert to the\r\nsouth of the present \"Mediterranean\" region of western America made it\r\ndifficult for the trees to migrate southwards at the onset of cold\r\nconditions in the glacial period, and thus many forms, which are known\r\nto have existed in California in Tertiary times, have now completely\r\ndisappeared from the region, while they persist in the eastern forests\r\nto this day.\r\n\r\nThe third type of forest which occurs in the eastern half of North\r\nAmerica is the \"rain forest\" of Florida and parts of the adjacent\r\nstates. Here the rainfall is abundant all the year round, with a summer\r\nmaximum, and the temperature is high. There is thus no need to economise\r\nwater, and where the soil permits there is a luxuriant type of forest,\r\nwhich recalls that of the tropics, although it is poorer. Where soil\r\nconditions are unfavourable we have pine woods, conifers throughout the\r\neastern United States always taking advantage of conditions relatively\r\nunfavourable to the broad-leafed trees.\r\n\r\nThus if we follow the eastern seaboard of the United States from\r\nLabrador to Florida we pass through the following floral regions:--\r\n(1) Coniferous forest, with relatively few species, (2) mixed coniferous\r\nand deciduous forest with chiefly the harder types of deciduous trees,\r\n(3) predominantly deciduous forest with many of the larger-leafed and\r\nmore delicate forms, and finally (4) forest of the sub-tropical rainy\r\ntype, intermixed with coniferous woods on the barren sandy soil and in\r\nthe swamps.\r\n\r\nThe western coast shows more uniformity, the western type of coniferous\r\nforest stretching from Alaska to California, though it is richer, and\r\nmore luxuriant in the warmer regions when moisture is still obtainable.\r\nAs the moisture diminishes the forest dies away and desert or\r\nsemi-desert conditions supervene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF ANIMAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we looked at a few of the interesting\r\ngeneralisations which have emerged of late years from the study of plant\r\ndistribution. An enormous amount of detailed investigation had been done\r\nbefore these generalisations were arrived at, and though still much\r\nremains to be done, yet the broad lines of a science of plant\r\ndistribution may now be said to be established. The scientific study of\r\nanimal distribution has not yet reached a corresponding stage of\r\nadvancement, partly no doubt because the dependence of the more highly\r\norganised and active animal upon the physical conditions is less close\r\nthan that of the stationary plant, so that the subject is more\r\ndifficult. Facts are accumulating on all sides, but the subject is still\r\nrather at the level of collecting information than at that of laying\r\ndown broad generalisations. There are, however, indications of progress\r\nin many directions, and an attempt will be made here to suggest some of\r\nthe lines along which research is especially busy at the present time.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of plants we confined our attention exclusively to land\r\nplants, for the reason that aquatic plants are usually small in size,\r\nrelatively simple in structure, of somewhat limited vertical\r\ndistribution, owing to their dependence upon light, and of little direct\r\nimportance to man. In considering animals, on the other hand, we cannot\r\nexclude the aquatic forms, which are often of great human importance. In\r\nmany regions man depends largely, sometimes even exclusively, on the\r\nanimals of the sea for his food. We shall, then, begin with some account\r\nof aquatic animals, considering the subject, as before, especially from\r\nthe point of view of the inhabitants of Europe and North America.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the sea we find that the scientific study of marine\r\nanimals received an enormous impetus from the work of the _Challenger_\r\nexpedition. The results of that expedition appeared in many large\r\nvolumes, which form a conspicuous feature in any complete scientific\r\nlibrary and contain a mass of useful material. The _Challenger_\r\nexpedition was followed by many others, European and American, and the\r\nresult is that we now know a great deal about marine animals and their\r\ndistribution. Further, the Fishery Boards of various Governments carry\r\non continuous observations on the conditions of life in the seas near\r\ntheir coasts, which have added and are adding enormously to our\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nWe cannot here consider in detail the various facts brought to light by\r\nthese means. Only a few general points can be touched upon. One\r\ninteresting generalisation is that the life of the ocean can be divided\r\ninto three groups: the life of the littoral or shore zone, the life of\r\nthe open ocean (pelagic fauna), and the life of the great ocean depths\r\n(abyssal fauna). The last, though of great zoological interest, is so\r\nremote from human life that we need not consider it. The pelagic forms\r\ninclude both the small delicate organisms which float passively with the\r\nocean currents, and also powerful swimmers like many fish, and aquatic\r\nmammals such as whales and seals. The littoral forms live in the region\r\nwhich is within the reach of land influences, that is, from low-tide\r\nmark to the edge of the Continental Shelf (cf. p. 27). Among forms\r\ndirectly important to man they include many fish; crustaceans such as\r\ncrabs and lobsters; shell-fish such as oysters, mussels, clams, etc.;\r\nless important forms such as sea-urchins, which are extensively eaten in\r\nthe Mediterranean; sponges, an important article of commerce; the\r\nvarious corals, especially the precious coral, and so on.\r\n\r\nOf the useful marine animals, those which are most readily captured are\r\nthe littoral forms, many of which, on shores where the tides are well\r\nmarked, are exposed, or at least brought within easy reach, by the daily\r\nebb and flow of the tide, and can be obtained with the minimum of\r\napparatus. The extensive shell-mounds found on many shores, _e. g._ on\r\nthose of Denmark, show at how early a date man availed himself of the\r\nabundant food supply to be obtained on the shore rocks. All edible\r\nanimals found in the sea are \"fish\" to maritime populations, but fish in\r\nthe restricted sense are usually more active, and require more skill for\r\ntheir capture than the less intelligent molluscs or crustaceans, and\r\nwere probably not used at so early a date. They are by no means equally\r\ndistributed in all seas, and their distribution shows many points of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nWe must notice, in the first instance, that the waste of the land is of\r\ngreat importance in feeding marine forms, whether directly or\r\nindirectly. Marine animals, therefore, occur most abundantly over the\r\nContinental Shelf, where they are within reach of the food brought down\r\nby the rivers from the land. Again, many fish, or the organisms upon\r\nwhich fish feed, depend largely upon those minute plants called diatoms\r\nwhich float in the upper layers of the waters of the ocean. These are\r\nespecially abundant in the colder seas, which doubtless helps to explain\r\nthe abundance of fish in high latitudes. These diatoms, like many other\r\nsmall organisms in the sea, are swept about by the ocean currents, whose\r\ncourse greatly influences the movements of fish.\r\n\r\nWe saw in the case of forests that hot climates conduce to a great\r\nvariety of species, while in colder climates the species are few, but\r\nthe number of individuals very great. Something of the same sort seems\r\nto occur with fishes. In warm seas the number of species is very great,\r\nwhile in colder seas there are fewer species, but those which do occur\r\nare sometimes found in vast numbers. Fortunately for man these prolific\r\nnorthern species are often edible, whereas in warm seas poisonous or\r\ninedible forms are common. The valuable cod family is found chiefly in\r\nhigh latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of the facts just described is that valuable fisheries\r\ntend to occur in cool or cold climates rather than hot ones, and because\r\nof the dependence of so many forms on the Continental Shelf, they occur\r\nin the northern or land hemisphere rather than in the southern or\r\noceanic one.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable fisheries in the world seem to be those off\r\nNewfoundland, where the broad Continental Shelf, forming the so-called\r\n\"banks,\" feeds myriads of cod. The mingling of the waters brought by the\r\ncold Labrador currents with those brought by the warm Gulf Stream\r\nperhaps influences this marvellous abundance of fish, as does also the\r\nwaste brought by the icebergs.\r\n\r\nNext to the banks of Newfoundland the most valuable fishing ground is\r\nthe shallow North Sea, which, as we have seen, lies on the surface of\r\nthe Continental Shelf. Fish are much more abundant here than on the\r\nnarrower shelf on the western coast of Britain, and the wealth of the\r\nNorth Sea has been an important factor in the development of the\r\ncountries bordering it.\r\n\r\nThe warm, salt, relatively deep, and tide-less Mediterranean is not\r\nnearly so rich in food fishes as the more northerly seas, a fact\r\nreflected in the large importation of dried fish alike from Newfoundland\r\nand from the region of the North Sea. But this is an economic and not a\r\nzoological statement, for the Mediterranean is in reality richer in fish\r\nspecies than the North Sea, in this respect, as in some others,\r\napproaching tropical regions. Among the economically important fish are\r\nthe tunny, a very large form allied to the mackerel, which is dried, and\r\nsardines and anchovies, which are preserved in oil. Otherwise the fish\r\nare eaten fresh, and do not enter into general trade.\r\n\r\nFresh-water fish are abundant all over Europe, but with some exceptions\r\nthey are not greatly prized in those countries where the\r\nbetter-flavoured marine fish can be obtained. Elsewhere, as in Russia,\r\nGermany, and parts of France, they become important.\r\n\r\nMuch more valuable than fresh-water fish in the strict sense are the\r\nvarious kinds of salmon, which come up the rivers to breed, but spend\r\nmuch time also in salt water. In the rivers of Scotland and Scandinavia\r\nsalmon are still very important, but the fisheries in both cases are\r\ninsignificant when compared with those of western North America. Salmon\r\nare inhabitants of temperate waters, and in North America do not extend\r\nfurther south than the rivers flowing into the north of the Gulf of\r\nCalifornia. Off the coast of Alaska and British Columbia, especially the\r\nformer, they are enormously abundant, and being caught in quantities\r\nwhich far exceed the local demand are largely canned for export.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in regard to fresh-water fish, as with\r\nmarine forms, the northern part of the world is especially rich in\r\nedible species, as compared alike with the southern hemisphere and with\r\nthe tropics. The salmon family is confined to the northern hemisphere,\r\nand the carp family, though not peculiar, is largely represented in the\r\nnorth. To it belong the whitefish, which form important food fish in\r\nmany parts of America. Sturgeon, which are important in Russia, occur in\r\nthe great rivers of eastern Europe, and in parts of Asia, and also on\r\nthe eastern coast of North America, and off California.\r\n\r\nTurning next to the distribution of land animals within the European\r\narea, the first point is to note that for the globe at large zoologists\r\nemploy zoogeographical divisions based chiefly upon the distribution of\r\nthe land _mammals_. The reasons for this are manifold.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, mammals are of relatively recent origin, and in\r\ntaking account of their spread over the globe, we may assume that in\r\nbroad outline the continents, or at least the deep oceans, were much the\r\nsame when the existing mammals were evolved as at present. This\r\nnaturally simplifies the problem, for if we divided the globe into\r\nregions on the basis of the distribution of reptiles, for example, we\r\nshould find it necessary to take account of many differences between the\r\nworld in which the first reptiles arose and the world as it is at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAgain, the chances of land mammals passing from one region to another,\r\nexcept by the crossing of land surfaces, are small. Thus the occurrence\r\nof similar land mammals in two regions now widely separated is almost\r\ncertain proof of a former land connection between the two regions. The\r\ndifficulty which most land mammals find in crossing mountain chains, or\r\ndeserts, or considerable extents of water, makes it easy to define\r\nzoogeographical regions separated from one another by the existence of\r\nsuch \"barriers to distribution\" as they are called. Finally, mammals are\r\nhighly organised animals of relatively large size, and their\r\ndistribution is more easily studied than that of insects, for instance.\r\n\r\nWithout going into the zoogeographical regions in detail, we may note\r\nthat there is, as already stated, considerable resemblance between the\r\nmammals of Europe, Asia, Africa and North America, that is, of the land\r\nhemisphere, while South America, which was for long isolated from North\r\nAmerica, has a peculiar and relatively primitive fauna, and Australia,\r\nwhose isolation has lasted longer, has an even more peculiar and a much\r\nmore primitive fauna.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the fauna of the great land mass formed by the\r\ncontinents of Europe, Asia, Africa and North America, sometimes called\r\nby zoogeographers the _Arctogæic_ realm, we find that North America\r\ndiffers from the eastern land mass as regards its land mammals in\r\nseveral respects. Though long separated from South America it has been\r\nconnected long enough for some of the southern forms to find their way\r\nnorthwards, so that we find skunks, raccoons, and other mammals\r\nstrikingly different from analogous forms found in the Old World. Again,\r\nit is relatively so long since there was any free communication between\r\nthe eastern and western hemispheres that the two faunas have had time to\r\ndiverge without destroying the fundamental resemblance.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the fauna of the Old World, we find that no effective\r\nbarrier of any sort separates the animals of Europe, even of western\r\nEurope, from the animals of temperate Asia, even of eastern Asia. Right\r\nacross from the British Isles to Japan, through about a hundred and\r\nfifty degrees of longitude, there is great general similarity in the\r\nland animals. To the south, on the other hand, the Atlas mountains and\r\nthe African desert cut off the greater part of the continent of Africa,\r\nand eastwards the transverse mountain chains, no less than the\r\ndifference of climate and the cold, barren nature of the uplands of\r\ncentral Asia, cut off the rich fauna of the peninsula of India with\r\nFurther India, etc., from the habitable regions of temperate Asia, with\r\ntheir scantier fauna.\r\n\r\nWe are thus left with the conception of a very large and tolerably\r\nuniform zoological region, stretching right across Europe and temperate\r\nand northern Asia. This is the Palæarctic region of zoogeographers.\r\n\r\nThe European section of it is somewhat impoverished as compared with the\r\nAsiatic section, partly perhaps because of the effects of the ice, and\r\ncertainly also because for long ages Europe has been densely populated,\r\nand the larger wild animals have thus been exterminated. Asia, with its\r\nnorthern forests and its more southerly steppes, has always been a great\r\nreservoir of life, which has periodically overflowed into Europe. Some\r\nof these overflowing animals, like the black and the brown rats,\r\nsucceeded in establishing themselves very firmly; others, like the saiga\r\nantelope, died out rapidly except in the extreme east of the European\r\narea.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that further investigation will show that not the mammals\r\nonly, but land animals in general can be grouped according to their\r\nhabitat like plants, but so far the attempts made in this direction have\r\nbeen tentative only. Generally, we may say that the mammals of Central\r\nEurope are of the woodland type, but no detailed classification into\r\nsteppe and woodland animals exists. It may be useful, therefore, to\r\nindicate the chief kinds of mammals found in the European area, grouped\r\naccording to affinity, in the absence of a geographical classification.\r\n\r\nMammals, apart from the egg-laying monotremes, and the marsupials of\r\nAustralia, are divided into nine orders, and of these, one, that\r\nincluding the anteaters, etc., of South America, Africa and India, is\r\nentirely unrepresented in Europe. Another, the Cetaceans, or whales, has\r\nno land representatives; and the same is true of the aberrant sea-cows,\r\nthough their ancestors lived on land and occurred in Egypt.\r\n\r\nExcluding these orders we are left with six which have European\r\nrepresentatives. These are the following:--\r\n\r\nPrimates, or monkeys and apes.\r\n\r\nInsectivores, or insect-eating mammals, such as moles, shrews and\r\nhedgehogs.\r\n\r\nChiroptera, or bats.\r\n\r\nUngulates, or hoofed animals, including horses, cattle, sheep, deer,\r\npigs, etc.\r\n\r\nCarnivores, or flesh-eaters, including lions, cats, foxes, dogs, etc.\r\n\r\nRodents, or gnawing animals, among which are rats, mice, squirrels, etc.\r\n\r\nThe _Primates_ are represented by one form only, the Barbary ape, found\r\nin Gibraltar. _Bats_ are numerous, but are of less geographical\r\ninterest than land forms. The remaining four orders are all important.\r\nThe _Ungulates_ include the largest land mammals, and their size and\r\nconspicuous nature have led to the gradual replacement of the wild forms\r\nby domesticated ones. Only a very few, such as deer, wild goats (ibex),\r\nthe wild boar, the wild sheep (moufflon) of Corsica, manage to survive,\r\nand that mostly by aid of special protection. The presence of the large\r\nwild forms is incompatible with almost any form of agriculture as is\r\noften proved disastrously in Africa, hence man's ruthless warfare upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut if man has destroyed the large ungulates he has found himself unable\r\neven to reduce the numbers of the _Rodents_, who gain in many ways by\r\ncivilisation. The destruction of their rivals, the grass-eating\r\nungulates, increases their natural food-supply. In South America, where\r\nthere were very few ungulates till the white man brought his flocks and\r\nherds, the rodents were very numerous and reached a great size. Again,\r\nthe operations of agriculture give the rodents enormous artificial\r\nsources of food-supply, and the number of man's domesticated or\r\nsemi-domesticated animals makes him wage a bitter war against the small\r\ncarnivores, the natural enemies of the rodents. Protected from their\r\nenemies, abundantly fed by man's providence, it is no wonder that these\r\nsmall animals have multiplied greatly.\r\n\r\nTheir multiplication has been assisted by the fact that they inherit\r\nfrom their early days, when the struggle was keen, an enormous\r\nfertility. Many of the rodents are steppe animals, and share with steppe\r\norganisms in general the power of periodic multiplication in enormous\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThe steppe is a region where the rainfall is normally just enough to\r\nensure a free growth of grass at certain seasons. Variations in\r\nrainfall, which perhaps occur in great cycles, may at one time produce a\r\nluxuriance of growth which increases the food-supply all round, and at\r\nanother give rise to semi-desert conditions with a resulting enormous\r\ndeath-rate. The steppe organisms, then, must be very fertile because of\r\nthe risks of their environment, and the Asiatic overflow is possibly\r\ndetermined by successions of years of abundant rainfall, which increase\r\nthe number of individuals, followed by a series of years of scanty rain,\r\nwhich make it necessary for the overflow of population to migrate.\r\n\r\nAmong examples of European rodents we may mention the very destructive\r\nrats, mice and voles, which practically feed everywhere at man's\r\nexpense; and the hamster, an Asiatic form which reaches as far west as\r\nthe Rhine, and stores large quantities of corn and other food in an\r\nelaborately made burrow. The hamster has the rodent power of rapid\r\nmultiplication, and is often terribly destructive to cultivated crops.\r\nRabbits are similarly very destructive where special precautions are not\r\ntaken. Even the porcupine of southern Europe is capable of doing\r\nconsiderable damage. Less serious enemies of man are such forms as the\r\nfollowing:--lemmings; marmots, of which there are two forms, an Alpine\r\nand an Asiatic, the latter extending like the other steppe animals into\r\nthe plains of central Europe; beavers; squirrels; dormice; etc. These\r\nexamples may be sufficient to illustrate the important points in regard\r\nto the rodents--their destructiveness, their fertility, and the fact\r\nthat many were originally inhabitants of steppes and open plains, but\r\ntend, as man clears the forest-land for his own purposes, to extend\r\ntheir range to the cleared land, and to appropriate the new and\r\nextensive food-supply furnished by man's industry.\r\n\r\nWhile the ungulates, because of the nature of their food, must almost\r\nnecessarily be rather large animals, the carnivores occur both in large\r\nand small forms. The tendency is for the large forms to be killed out\r\nwith the progress of civilisation; thus the lion has wholly disappeared\r\nfrom Europe, wolf and bear are almost gone, but a considerable number of\r\nsmaller forms still remain, such as badger, genet, wolverene, lynx, wild\r\ncat, stoat, marten, weasel, etc. The last order to be mentioned, that of\r\nthe _Insectivores_, includes small mammals, such as moles, shrews, and\r\nhedgehogs, which feed largely on insects, but may be partially\r\nvegetarians.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected from the climate and from the peculiar flora, the\r\nMediterranean region possesses a richer fauna than central Europe, both\r\nas regards mammals and lower forms. Even the European portion shows\r\nconsiderable African influence.\r\n\r\nA few words must be said about other land animals apart from mammals. In\r\nregard to birds it is noticeable that the habit of migration, and the\r\nfact that the greater part of the continent of Europe lies on the\r\ndirect line between the northern breeding grounds of many species and\r\nthe southern winter quarters, gives Europe a very rich bird fauna. The\r\nBritish Islands owe to their peculiarly mild climate a rich bird fauna\r\nat all seasons, for while the summer climate attracts many forms for\r\nnesting purposes, the mild winter brings many migrants flying from the\r\ncold of continental Europe.\r\n\r\nIn regard to birds as well as to other animals, the Mediterranean owes\r\nto its warm climate a richer fauna than countries farther north. Some\r\ninteresting southern forms, such as pelican, flamingo and ibis, reach\r\nthis region, though not extending into central Europe, except as\r\nstragglers.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Europe is not hot enough anywhere to lead to the presence\r\nof a rich reptilian fauna, but there is, again, a marked increase to the\r\nsouth. It is stated that there are only twenty-one species of reptiles\r\nin central Europe, while there are fifty-nine in southern Europe, and no\r\nless than a hundred and forty in the Mediterranean region taken in the\r\nlarge sense. Poisonous forms are few, and do not, as in hotter\r\ncountries, constitute a serious menace to man. Very interesting is the\r\npresence of the chameleon in southern Spain, as in north Africa.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important human aspect of the European reptiles is the\r\npresence of numbers of insect-eating forms. In the warmer parts of\r\nEurope every wall or patch of rock seems alive with lizards in the\r\nsummer sunshine, and these must play a not inconsiderable part in the\r\nkeeping down of noxious insects.\r\n\r\nOmitting a great number of other groups, we may say something about\r\ninsects, which are of enormous importance in human life, both directly\r\nand indirectly.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown of late years that many insects are the sole means by\r\nwhich certain very deadly diseases are transmitted from man to man, or\r\nfrom one animal to another. Almost every few months a new announcement\r\nof an insect-carried disease is made, but the most important forms are\r\nthe following:--Mosquitoes and gnats transmit such diseases as malaria,\r\nyellow fever, and more horrible diseases still, due to the presence in\r\nthe blood of small parasitic worms. Tsetse flies carry sleeping\r\nsickness, and also transmit the very fatal fly disease of domesticated\r\nanimals, a fact which has been and is of great importance in the\r\nsettlement of Africa. In the case of most diseases there seems to be a\r\nclose connection between one particular species of insect and a\r\nparticular disease.\r\n\r\nMosquitoes and gnats are very abundant in many parts of Europe, and the\r\nforms belonging to the genus Anopheles, which carry the germ of malaria,\r\nare widely distributed. In parts of the Mediterranean area their\r\npresence is associated with the prevalence of malaria, which has existed\r\nthere for a prolonged period, and is believed by some to have had an\r\nimportant bearing upon the fates of the ancient civilisations of the\r\nMediterranean basin.\r\n\r\nThe regions in Europe affected, or seriously affected, by malaria are\r\ndiminishing yearly. This is now due to conscious efforts, but a similar\r\nprocess has been going on probably for a long period, for many obscure\r\ndiseases, notably \"ague,\" seem to have been forms of malaria. Their\r\ndisappearance seems to be due to drainage, which diminishes the breeding\r\nplaces of the mosquitoes, and also to the progress of agriculture, for\r\nponds which form on rich, well-manured land are apparently unsuited to\r\nmosquito larvæ. The subject is of great geographical importance, for\r\nthe spread of man over the surface of the globe, and the progress of\r\ncivilisation must have been influenced in all time by the prevalence of\r\nfly-borne disease. Such diseases have hitherto been the greatest\r\nobstacle in the way of the civilisation of Africa.\r\n\r\nIn Uganda extensive tracts of fertile wooded land have had to be\r\nabandoned on account of the presence there of the tsetse fly, while,\r\nprior to this abandonment, there were districts in which every living\r\nsoul had been destroyed by the deadly sleeping sickness transmitted by\r\nthis fly. We can hardly suppose that such facts are without a parallel\r\nin human history; and man's distribution over the surface of the globe,\r\nand in detail the distribution of his settlements within a country, have\r\ndoubtless been greatly influenced by the distribution even of such\r\ninsignificant creatures as the various kinds of flies.\r\n\r\nEven apart from their power of transmitting disease, the blood-sucking\r\nflies must have influenced man in his choice of localities for\r\nsettlements, and must have been an important factor in the process of\r\nadjustment to his surroundings. The naturalist Brehm gives an appalling\r\npicture of the number and blood-thirstiness of the mosquitoes of the\r\nSiberian tundra, which render life almost intolerable there for both man\r\nand beast in summer. Even within the British Islands the uncultivated\r\nand undrained regions are often badly infested with small blood-sucking\r\nflies, and their numbers must have been vastly greater in the old days\r\nbefore drainage and intensive cultivation had reduced them. It is quite\r\npossible that some of the anomalies in regard to the spread of\r\nparticular races of men over the surface can be explained by the varying\r\nsusceptibility of different races to insect attack, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that the blood-sucking insects must have had some effect in\r\ndetermining the rapidity or slowness with which particular tracts were\r\ncolonised by man.\r\n\r\nApart from the blood-sucking flies, there are many other interesting\r\npoints about the insects of Europe, notably the wealth of beautiful and\r\nstriking forms which occur round the Mediterranean basin. One of these,\r\nwhich extends northwards and westwards to northern France, is the\r\ncurious Praying Mantis, a predatory insect belonging to the same order\r\nas the locust. It is an eastern form, which, like so many others, has\r\ntaken advantage of the mild climate of western Europe to extend its\r\nrange far beyond what we must regard as its natural limits. In France it\r\nshows the effect of relatively unfavourable conditions in the fact that\r\nit takes some nine to ten months for the eggs to hatch, whereas in\r\nhotter countries the process may take place in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nIn the warmer parts of Europe a very striking feature is the number and\r\nlarge size of the members of the locust and grasshopper families, whose\r\nshrill noise is so characteristic a sound in, for example, the pastures\r\nof Switzerland in summer-time. Among the locusts there occur, in many\r\nparts of Europe, those migratory forms which possess that power of\r\nperiodic enormous multiplication which we have already noted so\r\nfrequently among grassland animals. The migratory instinct only seems to\r\ndevelop when the numbers have greatly increased in any given locality,\r\nand in Europe generally the climate does not permit this to take place.\r\nIt does, however, occur in the south-east of the Mediterranean basin,\r\nnotably in the island of Cyprus, in Syria, and also in Northern Africa,\r\nwhere locusts sometimes reach the dimensions of a plague.\r\n\r\nWe may add to this account of land animals a few details on the land\r\nmammals of North America. The great point of contrast here is that\r\nEurope, from the beginning of the historic period, has always been a\r\nrelatively well-peopled region, while in America, prior to the advent of\r\nthe white man, the population was scanty. There was thus far more room\r\nin North America than in Europe for great flocks of large mammals. Thus\r\nthe plains and prairies carried great herds of bison, while to the north\r\nthere were other herds of reindeer, which were never tamed by the\r\ninhabitants of North America as they were in the Old World by the Lapps\r\nand others. The musk-ox is another interesting animal found in the north\r\nof America. It once also lived in Europe, but died out long ago. Just as\r\nthe coniferous forest and tundra in Asia produce many small fur-bearing\r\nanimals, so do the forest and tundra of North America. Deer are present\r\nas in the Old World, though they are of different types, and there is a\r\ncurious animal known as the prong-buck which is peculiar. Wild sheep\r\noccur as they do in Europe, but no wild horse nor ass roams the plains\r\nof America as they roam to-day the wastes of Asia. Without going into\r\nfurther detail, we may say generally that as regards wild animals, no\r\nless than as regards wild plants, North America shows a closer\r\nresemblance to Asia than to that favoured peninsula of Asia which the\r\ngeographers call Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCULTIVATED PLANTS AND DOMESTICATED ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to discuss the chief races of men in Europe, something\r\nmust be said of its cultivated plants and animals. Originally,\r\ndoubtless, the various human groups which have mingled in Europe had\r\neach their own type of culture, based upon the possession and\r\ncultivation of particular animals and plants. The lapse of time has\r\ncaused so complete an intermixture that it is only possible to a very\r\nsmall extent to disentangle the different elements which have gone to\r\nthe making of present day civilisation. Nevertheless, as climatic\r\ndifferences remain and still determine minor differences, it seems worth\r\nwhile to consider briefly the distribution of cultivated plants and\r\ndomesticated animals at the present day.\r\n\r\nEurope has been so strongly influenced by the neighbouring land-masses\r\nof which it forms a part, that we must begin with a few words about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe great continent of Asia, of which Europe, as we have seen, is but a\r\npeninsula, can be divided into a series of zones, distinguished alike by\r\nclimate and by vegetation. To the north we have the cold tundra region,\r\npassing to the south into the forest region. The Asiatic forest region\r\nis continuous with that of Europe, but while the European forest extends\r\nsouthward till Mediterranean conditions intervene, close to the sea of\r\nthat name, the Asiatic forest has its southern limit in about the\r\nlatitude of London. To the south of the Asiatic forest stretches a zone\r\nof steppes passing into desert, and even into tundra in the elevated\r\nregions of Central Asia. The steppe region, as we have already\r\nindicated, enters Europe by way of Russia and pushes a long arm up the\r\nDanube into Hungary.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Asiatic steppes and deserts comes an interrupted band of\r\nwarm temperate or tropical forest, luxuriant to the east where there are\r\nsummer rains, scanty and scrub-like to the west, where Asia meets the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe steppes and desert of Asia are populated, scantily enough, with\r\nwandering pastoral nomads, who constantly tend to overflow from their\r\nown region into those of the surrounding agricultural populations. These\r\nagricultural populations are concentrated in three areas, all specially\r\nfavoured by nature. To the east the summer rains, the luxuriant\r\nindigenous flora, and the presence of great river valleys, that is, of\r\nnaturally fertile regions, led to the early establishment of\r\nagricultural populations in China and India. Further to the west, the\r\nfertile valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates early saw the founding of a\r\ngreat civilisation. This region, the Mesopotamia of geographers, is very\r\nnear the third area, the Mediterranean, though far enough removed to\r\nhave a very scanty rainfall, which made irrigation a necessity for\r\nagriculture. Its inter-relations with the Mediterranean must have begun\r\nearly, and, remembering that part of the Mediterranean itself is in\r\nAsia, we need not stop to discuss the vexed question as to whether the\r\nMediterranean civilisation was largely indigenous, or originated in the\r\ncontinent of Asia. It is often difficult to ascertain whether plants\r\nwhich have long been grown in the Mediterranean area, and are\r\nwell-fitted to it, are really indigenous there, or were brought to it\r\nfrom the Mesopotamian countries. There is much similarity of climatic\r\nconditions, and for our purpose it is sufficient to note that the\r\ncultivated plants of the Mediterranean basin fall into three main\r\ncategories. There are, first, the plants specially adapted to its\r\nclimate; these are either native or were introduced from the countries\r\nclose at hand. Second, there are many plants, much less perfectly\r\nadapted to conditions of drought, and therefore often demanding\r\nirrigation in summer, which were introduced from the Far East, after\r\nthey had been cultivated there for long periods. Thirdly, and much fewer\r\nin number, there are the plants introduced, at a relatively late date,\r\nfrom America.\r\n\r\nOf the first group the most important are the cereals barley and wheat,\r\nand the olive and the vine. These four have been known in the area from\r\nthe earliest times, and they still form the basis of the diet of\r\nMediterranean peoples. Bread, olive oil to replace the butter used by\r\npastoral peoples, wine as a beverage, with fresh grapes and the dried\r\nforms of raisins and currants, these early made life possible in the\r\nMediterranean area.\r\n\r\nBarley is older than wheat, and is more productive but less valuable. It\r\nis now largely grown in the basin of the Mediterranean as a food for\r\nhorses, instead of oats which, like rye, is a cereal not well suited to\r\nthe Mediterranean climate. As a bread plant it was early replaced in the\r\nMediterranean by wheat, but it is still used to make bread in some other\r\nparts of Europe, _e. g._ in Scandinavia, and is also of importance\r\noutside the Mediterranean as the origin of fermented beverages.\r\n\r\nWheat is the most valuable bread plant which exists, both on account of\r\nits proteid content and on account of its digestibility. It demands a\r\nwarm dry period for ripening, with much sunshine, and is well adapted to\r\nMediterranean conditions. Here it is sown in the autumn, to enable it to\r\ntake advantage of the \"early and the latter rain,\" _i. e._ the autumn\r\nand spring rains, and ripens early before the excessive drought of\r\nsummer sets in. Like barley it has always been associated with plough\r\nculture, the animal used being the ox. According to most authorities\r\nplough culture originated in Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\nThe vine and olive are apparently both indigenous to the Mediterranean,\r\nand both are well adapted to withstand drought. In regard to the vine\r\nthere are several interesting points. To the traveller from the north it\r\nis most familiar in France or Germany, where it is grown on sunny\r\nslopes, usually terraced to prevent stagnant water from lying. In the\r\nMediterranean, on the other hand, it is planted in hollows, or low-lying\r\nground, which permits of the collection of water, for it will receive no\r\nsummer rain. The vintage is more secure than further north, and the\r\nresistance to the attacks of parasites is greater, yet, curiously\r\nenough, the Mediterranean countries do not produce the finest wines.\r\nThis seems to be partly because the climate does not permit of the long\r\nstorage necessary for maturing to take place. The cool cellars, so\r\nimportant in the wine industry further north, are here absent.\r\n\r\nTo the four plants which we have mentioned we must add such forms as the\r\nfig, which if not indigenous was of very early introduction; garlic,\r\ngreatly valued as a flavouring matter; various kinds of pulse; sesame;\r\nmillet, once widely grown though no longer important, and flax, known\r\nfrom remote antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe second group, that comprising plants introduced from the Far East,\r\nincludes many valuable fruit trees, which in the region of the\r\nabsolutely rainless summer mostly require irrigation. The peach came\r\nfrom China in the time of Alexander the Great; the various citrus\r\nfruits, lemon, orange, lime, citron, etc., now so characteristic a\r\nfeature, were introduced from China or India. India also gave rice,\r\nextensively cultivated during long ages, and still extensively consumed,\r\nthough the facility with which communication with the East is now\r\neffected makes it relatively little grown, except in the plain of\r\nLombardy, which is easily irrigated. China sent the white mulberry, and\r\nwith it the cultivation of the silkworm, so important in many regions.\r\nFrom the Far East also came the sugar-cane, very important till the\r\nrecent development of the sugar beet industry. Cotton also was probably\r\nintroduced from the Far East, which thus supplied many cultivated plants\r\nand has enormously enriched life for Mediterranean man.\r\n\r\nOf the American plants of late introduction the most interesting is\r\nmaize, which fed the somewhat limited indigenous civilisation of North\r\nAmerica. Maize requires a warm climate with much sunshine, but needs\r\nmuch moisture during its short growing season. It is not a very\r\nvaluable cereal, but it is enormously productive and therefore cheap.\r\nGenerally it may be said to be used as food by man only when necessity\r\ncompels its use. It is thus employed by subject races, _e. g._ negroes,\r\nand by the poor in the warmer parts of Europe. In the Mediterranean it\r\nis not sufficiently valuable to be grown on irrigated land, and it will\r\nnot grow without irrigation where the summer is rainless. Where there\r\nare summer rains, however, as in North Italy, or where mountain slopes\r\nincrease the rainfall, as in parts of Greece, or where the land is\r\nrendered valueless for wheat by winter flooding, there maize is grown.\r\nGenerally it occurs within the Mediterranean area wherever the necessary\r\nwater occurs naturally or can be supplied cheaply. It forms a very\r\nimportant part of the food of the poor in North Italy, for example, but\r\nnot in the south, where water is too costly.\r\n\r\nTwo other important plants of American origin are tobacco and the\r\npotato. The latter plant is little grown in the Mediterranean, but a\r\nconsiderable amount of tobacco is produced. Another American plant, the\r\nprickly pear, besides furnishing an edible fruit, is important as a\r\nhedge plant within the area.\r\n\r\nCereals in the Mediterranean are grown, as we have seen, on ploughed\r\nland, as elsewhere. A more characteristic form of cultivation is\r\ngarden-culture, practised where water can be obtained for irrigation.\r\nSuch gardens consist primarily of fruit trees, all the citrus fruits,\r\npeaches, apricots, pomegranates, pistachio, almonds, and many other\r\nforms of nuts, plums, even apples and pears, being grown in this way. So\r\nproductive is the ground once water is supplied, that plants are grown\r\nin association in a fashion hardly suggested in the north. Thus among\r\nthe fruit trees many different kinds of vegetables, such as garlic,\r\ncucumbers, leeks, salad plants, many sorts of melons, tomatoes,\r\negg-plants, beans, and peas, etc., are grown. Elsewhere one may see corn\r\nsown beneath the olive trees, and the vine sharing the same ground with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe picture of Mediterranean life may be completed by adding a few words\r\nabout the domesticated animals. These are naturally in essence the same\r\nas those further north, but their relative numbers and the uses to which\r\nthey are put are different.\r\n\r\nThe dog and cat both occur, but the former has little importance in the\r\npastoral industries, and is largely a watch animal, insufficiently fed,\r\nand therefore important as a sanitary agent in that it devours garbage.\r\nAmong the ungulates or hoofed animals, the ass was domesticated in the\r\nregion long before the horse, and it and the mule are still more\r\nimportant than the horse, partly, no doubt, because both are hardier,\r\nand the problem of food is a difficulty in the largely pastureless\r\nMediterranean region.\r\n\r\nFew camels now occur in Europe, where they have been always closely\r\nassociated with Mahometans, appearing and disappearing with them.\r\n\r\nThe pasturage difficulty greatly reduces the importance of cattle, which\r\nare draught animals rather than a source of food. As draught animals\r\ncattle go back to the dawn of history, but their numbers are small and\r\nthe use of either their flesh or their milk as food is insignificant.\r\nPhilippson in his book on the Mediterranean gives some striking figures\r\nto illustrate the difference in numbers between the cattle of the\r\nMediterranean countries and those of Central Europe. Spain has only 2.1\r\nmillion cattle, and yet it is scarcely smaller than Germany, which has\r\n19 millions; Switzerland has 1,340,000 head of cattle, and Greece, which\r\nis about half as large again, has only 360,000. It is to be noted,\r\nhowever, that the irrigated plains of North Italy now support a\r\nconsiderable amount of cattle, whose milk gives rise to a considerable\r\ncheese industry; but, then, the olive will not grow in North Italy,\r\nwhich is therefore not strictly within the Mediterranean area.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs introduced the Indian buffalo which has spread considerably,\r\nand is now found in South Italy and the Balkan peninsula. The pig has\r\nbeen banished from parts of the region on religious grounds, but\r\nelsewhere it chiefly thrives where oak forests grow, the acorn being an\r\nimportant part of its food. The really important ungulates, however, are\r\nsheep and goats, which are often very numerous, and which, apart from\r\nbirds and fish, furnish the most important part of the animal food of\r\nthe inhabitants. The milk furnishes cheese, which is an important\r\nelement of diet, while leather, wool and hair are also important\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThe goats chiefly feed upon the young shoots of shrubs, and frequent the\r\ndenser thickets, while the sheep browse upon the grasses and herbs to\r\nbe found in the more open forms of maquis. The climate permits the\r\nanimals to remain in the open during the whole year, and this prevents\r\nthe collection of the manure for the arable lands. Further, the summer\r\ndrought makes it difficult for even these hardy animals to obtain food,\r\nand necessitates in many regions a curious form of nomadism, to which\r\nthe name of transhumance is given. Transhumance, still well developed in\r\nSpain, is the periodic and alternating displacement of flocks and herds\r\nbetween two regions of different climate.\r\n\r\nAs we have had frequent reason to remark, the rainlessness of the\r\nMediterranean summer is locally modified by many causes, notably by\r\nelevation. Mountains may receive frequent showers, while the plains are\r\nparched and brown, and therefore there may be pasture on the mountains\r\nwhile there is none in the plains. On lofty mountains also the winter\r\nsnow lingers long enough to promote the growth of summer pasture. While\r\nthere are considerable herds of sheep and goats, then, it may be\r\nnecessary for the flocks and their keepers to travel to the mountains in\r\nsummer and back to the plains in winter. In Spain these periodic\r\nmigrations, now largely made by means of the railway, formerly took\r\nplace by well-defined routes, along which the immense army of sheep,\r\naccompanied by a smaller army of attendants, passed twice a year,\r\ncausing enormous destruction to the cultivated lands through which they\r\npassed. Everywhere the conflict between shepherd and husbandman is more\r\nor less acute, but it seems to have been especially acute in Spain,\r\nwhich is in some respects a link between Africa and Europe. Its constant\r\nliability to Arab invasion made agriculture especially difficult, while\r\nfrequent wars favoured the pastoral industry; for flocks may be removed\r\nto a place of safety on an alarm, but agriculture must have some\r\nsecurity before it can develop. In the semi-desert regions of North\r\nAfrica some form of pastoral nomadism, with the social polity which\r\ncomes from pastoral nomadism, was the natural result of the physical and\r\nclimatic conditions, and Spain, like the lands of the eastern part of\r\nEurope, has been constantly liable to have its nascent agriculture\r\ndestroyed by incursions of such pastoral nomads. In both cases the slow\r\nvictory of the agriculturists, marked by many temporary reverses,\r\naffords an extraordinarily interesting chapter in human history. A\r\nstable civilisation must always be based upon agriculture, but every\r\ndisturbance of an old and stable civilisation has temporarily encouraged\r\nthe pastoral as contrasted with the agricultural industries.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the other animals of the Mediterranean, mention need only\r\nbe made of the domesticated birds. The fowl has long been known; it is\r\nbelieved to have been introduced from the East eight centuries B.C. Both\r\nthe eggs and the flesh are of great importance as a source of food. In\r\nspite of Roman history, geese are relatively unimportant, as are also\r\nducks, but the turkey, late introduction from America, is well suited to\r\nthe climate and has become important. Pigeons are everywhere abundant,\r\nsometimes so much so that their manure is extensively used as a\r\nfertiliser. We have already mentioned silkworms, and students of\r\nclassical history know that bees have long been kept.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we sum up what has been said about Mediterranean cultivated plants,\r\nwe may note that these have been derived partly from native plants,\r\npartly from plants native to the warm forest country of eastern Asia,\r\nand partly from American plants. Regarding for a moment the Eurasiatic\r\ncontinent as a whole, we may say that the old civilisations, both to the\r\neast and to the west, arose in the forest regions--in the monsoon\r\nforests to the east, in the drought-resisting forest or scrub of the\r\nwest. The temperate forest of Asia has produced no great civilisation,\r\nand the civilisation of the temperate forest zone of Europe has owed\r\nmuch to the earlier civilisation of the Mediterranean, with which it has\r\nalways had free communication.\r\n\r\nThis free communication has taken place chiefly by means of the\r\nMediterranean seaboard of France, especially by means of the great Rhone\r\nvalley, which forms a natural highway to the north. France, with both an\r\nAtlantic and a Mediterranean seaboard, has been the natural intermediary\r\nbetween the Mediterranean scrub land, with its characteristic\r\ncivilisation, and the temperate forest region, with its colder climate,\r\nand its greater rainfall, which produce a corresponding difference in\r\nthe cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that wheat is the great bread plant of the Mediterranean,\r\nand it is interesting to note that in this respect France is almost\r\npurely Mediterranean. It is, above all, the country of white bread,\r\nwhich plays a very important part in the dietary of the people. In\r\nordinary years the country produces nearly as much wheat as it consumes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this large use of wheat as a bread plant, France shows\r\nstrong Mediterranean influence in the part which wine plays in the\r\ndietary of the people, in the variety of vegetables, especially kinds of\r\npulse, which are grown; in the fact that fowls and pork form a large\r\npart of the animal food consumed, and in that flax has been grown in\r\nconsiderable amounts for long ages, so that linen is an important part\r\nof household wealth. The Midi is of course definitely Mediterranean in\r\nculture, but just as the vine extends far to the north and west so also\r\ndo Mediterranean influences extend far beyond the region of\r\nMediterranean climate and Mediterranean flora.\r\n\r\nBut fertile as much of France is, it must not be regarded as consisting\r\nof nothing but fields of waving wheat. To complete and correct the\r\npicture we must add that, as in Russia, considerable amounts of\r\nbuckwheat are grown for use as human food. Buckwheat, the \"black wheat\"\r\nof the French, perhaps introduced by the Arabs, is not a true cereal,\r\nbut a relative of the knot-grass of British fields. It is very easily\r\ngrown, even on poor land, and in France replaces wheat where the\r\nconditions are unfavourable, or where agriculture is backward. It is not\r\nwithout interest to note that while its use in France as human food is\r\nan indication of extreme poverty, in the United States buckwheat cakes\r\ntake a place as a luxury. Oatcakes in lowland Scotland, \"black bread\" in\r\nwell-to-do households in Germany, are other similar instances of the\r\nreappearance of a despised food-stuff as a luxury. Such foods become\r\nluxuries when they can be used to supplement, not to replace, white\r\nbread. Most of the buckwheat of France, however, is now grown as food\r\nfor domesticated animals.\r\n\r\nAgain, fruit trees are extensively grown in France as in the\r\nMediterranean region, with a gradual increase in the forms which require\r\nmore moisture and less heat as we travel northwards. The typically\r\nMediterranean forms early disappear, while many kinds of plums, pears\r\nand apples increase in numbers and in value. As we travel northwards\r\nalso, the various forms of berries, scarcely represented in the south,\r\nincrease in importance. The strawberries of Brittany form a good\r\nexample, but throughout Europe generally this change takes place,\r\nculminating in the enormous wealth of wild berries--cranberries,\r\nwhortleberries, and so on, which is a characteristic feature of the\r\nScandinavian uplands in late summer.\r\n\r\nAs we travel to the north-west also, with the increase in the rainfall\r\nand the consequent increase in pasturage, the number of cattle\r\nincreases, and with them the increased use of beef as food, and the\r\nincreased use of cows' milk and milk products. This is well seen in the\r\nbroad fields of Normandy, while still further west, in the British\r\nIslands, pastures become more and more extensive, and only the existence\r\nof a well-marked \"rain shadow\" on the eastern seaboard, which is robbed\r\nof much of its rainfall by the hills of the west, makes the extensive\r\ngrowth of wheat possible in south-eastern England. With the increase of\r\npasture, and the increased cold of winter, as compared with the\r\nMediterranean area, we have stall-feeding, with the possibility of\r\ncollecting manure for the fields. The consequence is that England, with\r\na climate very different from that which wheat experiences elsewhere,\r\nhas a yield per acre greater than that of any other country in the\r\nworld. France, despite her warmth and sunshine, only gets an average of\r\n19 bushels to the acre from her wheat fields, while in England, where\r\nwheat can only be grown at a profit when the conditions are especially\r\nfavourable, the average yield is 30 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nIn those parts of Europe where the climate or soil does not suit\r\ncereals, even such cereals as oats and rye, there is a tendency for\r\nthese to be partially replaced as the basis of the diet by plants\r\nrequiring less sunshine and tolerant of greater moisture. Thus in\r\nIreland and North Germany, the potato is a very important article of\r\ndiet, while in France and in Mediterranean regions generally it is\r\nunimportant. Similarly, towards the north the \"fowl in the pot\" tends to\r\nbe replaced by fish, in the case of those who cannot afford beef or\r\nmutton.\r\n\r\nIn the more northern regions also, with their relatively large rainfall,\r\nroot crops play a very important part. Most of these are grown for the\r\ndomestic animals, as turnips, mangels, swedes, etc., a phenomenon which\r\ndoes not occur in the Mediterranean area to any extent; but the sugar\r\nbeet, whose cultivation is spreading greatly in northern and central\r\nEurope, is of course grown for its yield of sugar.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that wine is the universal drink through the greater part\r\nof France, and this in spite of the fact that the northern limit of the\r\nvine, so far as wine-making is concerned, is in France about lat.\r\n47-1/2°, that is, about the north of the Loire. In Germany, the vine\r\nreaches to the east, in the Province of Posen, a latitude of nearly 53°\r\nN., owing to the fact that the summers grow warmer as we pass eastward.\r\nNevertheless, in Germany, as a general rule, wine is a luxury, the\r\ninfluence of Mediterranean culture being less felt than in France.\r\nThroughout Germany, as throughout northern Europe generally, wine is\r\nreplaced by beverages made by the fermentation of cereals or other plant\r\nproducts rich in starch. Throughout Germany, as throughout much of\r\nEngland, beer is the characteristic drink, and associated with it we\r\nhave the growth of hops, used as a flavouring material. Further north\r\nstronger beverages tend to be used.\r\n\r\nAnother plant which is widely grown in the more northerly parts of\r\nEurope, especially in Russia and the Baltic countries, is flax, which,\r\nthough originally Mediterranean, is now grown for its fibre chiefly in\r\nthe north, partly because it is especially suited for flat moist land.\r\n\r\nHaving now looked at the cultivated plants of the Mediterranean in their\r\nbearing on the life of the inhabitants, and compared with them the\r\nplants cultivated in extra-Mediterranean areas, let us conclude this\r\nchapter by a few words on the purely pastoral peoples. These do not now\r\noccur in Europe in unmodified form, but the Asiatic steppes still\r\ncontain pastoral folk, diminishing with the progress of civilisation.\r\nThere can be no doubt that such pastoral folk have repeatedly invaded\r\nEurope, and have there undergone modifications owing to the different\r\nconditions which prevail.\r\n\r\nOf pastoral folk in the unmodified form the Kirghiz of the Asiatic\r\nsteppes form perhaps the best example. They are pure nomads, wandering\r\nabout in search of pasture for their numerous herds, and dwelling in a\r\nmovable tent, or yurt, which can be readily carried from one place to\r\nanother. The herds consist of horses, sheep, goats, cattle, and camels,\r\nand the females of all these animals are milked. The Kirghiz do not\r\ncultivate land, or only to a very slight extent, and practically do not\r\neat bread, though flour and rice, obtained by barter, are employed by\r\nthe richer. Milk and milk-products, with the flesh of the flocks, form\r\nthe basis of the diet, and a milk-wine or koumiss, produced by the\r\nfermentation of milk, is the characteristic drink. This brief\r\ndescription is based upon that of the traveller Brehm, and as it was\r\nwritten some fifty years ago, matters have doubtless changed\r\nconsiderably since, but it remains as the typical picture of the nomadic\r\npastoral life. In the smaller spaces of densely populated Europe it\r\nwould of course be impossible, and here pastoral nomadism is mostly\r\nreplaced by that modified form known as transhumance upon which we have\r\nalready touched.\r\n\r\nAs the European peoples of Asiatic origin are specially found on high\r\nground, we may conclude by contrasting briefly with the above the life\r\nof the pastoral folk of Switzerland. Here there is no yurt or movable\r\ntent, but the old conditions are suggested by the fact that each family\r\nmay possess as many as four houses. Thus in some of the valleys\r\ntributary to the Rhone in the canton Valais the following conditions\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nThere is first the true village, where each house is a miniature\r\nhomestead, with dwelling, cow-house, hayloft, and granaries or\r\nstore-houses. Round about are fields, where rye, the characteristic\r\ncereal, is grown, with some fodder plants. Higher up the valley is the\r\nspring pasture or \"mayen,\" whither the cows are driven in May, to feed\r\nuntil the alps or high pastures are clear of snow. At the mayen there\r\nare cow-houses, and also human habitations, though not of an elaborate\r\ntype. Further up, again, there are necessarily huts near the high\r\npastures, whither a few men only go with the cows as herds, and where\r\nthe cheese is made. The fourth village is placed on the hot plain of the\r\nRhone valley, and here are the vineyards whose produce gives the\r\nmuch-prized wine, and orchards which yield fruit. We find here therefore\r\na curious combination of pastoral and agricultural life. Mostly of the\r\nrace called Alpine, believed to be of Asiatic origin, these Swiss folk\r\nhave borrowed the vine and the use of wine from the Mediterranean\r\npeoples. The large part played in their diet by milk products,\r\nespecially various forms of cheese, must be an inheritance from their\r\nnomad ancestors, while the rye, which is their bread plant, is also a\r\nheritage from Asiatic ancestors. The occurrence of four sets of\r\ndwellings instead of a movable one is an adaptation to life in a settled\r\ncommunity, confined to a limited space. The whole social polity is thus\r\na curious example of a transitional condition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have thus, in successive chapters, shown that in Europe three chief\r\nzones of vegetation exist, the Mediterranean scrub land, the temperate\r\nforest zone, the steppe or pasture land, and that as each of these is\r\ndetermined by climate, each, again, has special types of cultivated\r\nplants and domesticated animals, involving a special social polity in\r\neach case. Now it is interesting to note, what cannot be a pure\r\ncoincidence, that in Europe three races of men exist, which show a\r\ncertain rough correspondence to the three zones of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean type of vegetation and climate is associated with a\r\nparticular race, to which the name of Mediterranean has been given. The\r\nrace is by no means confined to the Mediterranean region--we find\r\nrepresentatives of it, _e. g._ in western Ireland,--nor does it occupy\r\nthe whole of that region, for in many places it is pressed hard by other\r\nraces, but it reaches its fullest development within the Mediterranean\r\nbasin. Curiously enough, also, its presence in western Ireland is\r\nassociated with the presence of certain representatives of the\r\nMediterranean flora, notably the arbutus or strawberry tree and St.\r\nDabeoc's heath.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic inhabitants of the temperate forest region of Europe\r\nare the members of the race called Teutonic or Nordic, whose particular\r\ntype of civilisation is deeply stamped by the lessons they learnt in\r\ntheir early struggle with the forest.\r\n\r\nFinally, the steppe and pasture lands, whether in parts of Russia, in\r\nthe Hungarian plain, or in the Alps and in the uplands of Brittany and\r\nCentral Europe, etc., tend to be occupied by a third race, which seems\r\nto have originated in the steppes of Asia, and to which the somewhat\r\ninappropriate name of Alpine has been given, though it occurs in\r\nlowlands to the east as well as in uplands to the west. This race seems\r\nto be accompanied throughout Europe by plants and animals of Asiatic\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe full meaning of this association between racial peculiarities and\r\ntypes of vegetation cannot perhaps be formulated meantime, but it is\r\ninteresting to note that there are some curiously close connections\r\nbetween human life and the distribution of vegetation. For instance, all\r\ntravellers in Switzerland must have been struck by the curious fact that\r\nin following up the Rhone valley from the lake of Geneva to the Rhone\r\nglacier the French language is found to extend up to the town of Sion,\r\nand beyond, without any obvious cause, German prevails. It has been\r\npointed out recently that the eastward extension of the French language\r\nhere marks also the eastward extension of the sweet chestnut--a curious\r\ncoincidence.\r\n\r\nAgain, the same writer points out that the battle-ground between the\r\nFrench and German peoples round the Rhine is the region where the growth\r\nof the sweet chestnut as a planted tree reaches its eastward limit. Such\r\nfacts must not, of course, be over-emphasised. Both must indicate a\r\nclimatic change, but it can hardly be supposed that this change of\r\nclimate is sufficient to affect man directly. It seems at least\r\njustifiable to point out that every human group which reaches any degree\r\nof civilisation and stability must depend for its permanence in the\r\nearly stages on some special skill in the growing of certain cultivated\r\nplants, and the rearing of certain domesticated animals. We have much\r\nreason to believe that this skill is often difficult to acquire by other\r\ngroups. The great difficulties which have been experienced in\r\nintroducing _e. g._ Smyrna figs and dates into the United States; the\r\nfact that Europeans seem to find it impossible to manage camels without\r\nnative help, and that they have been hitherto unable, despite most\r\nelaborate and costly experiments, to tame the African elephant, seem to\r\nbe minor illustrations of this fact. Given, then, an evolving group\r\nspreading over the surface of the globe, and taking with it its\r\ncharacteristic plants and animals, it is probable enough that such a\r\nchange of climate, even a minor change, as may be sufficient to render\r\nit impossible to cultivate these plants, or to rear these animals, may\r\ngive a definite and more or less permanent check to the spread of the\r\nrace. There is at least some evidence to this effect, and it gives an\r\nadditional interest to the study of plant geography.\r\n\r\nWe have limited ourselves in this chapter practically to a consideration\r\nof the European area, because the existing cultivated plants and\r\ndomesticated animals of North America are almost all derived from\r\nEurope, with the exceptions already indicated, and a few others not of\r\ngreat importance, and their distribution in America is determined by the\r\nsame conditions as in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE RACES OF EUROPE AND THEIR ORIGIN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have spoken in the previous chapter of the three chief races of\r\nEurope, but before proceeding to discuss them in detail it is necessary\r\nto clear the ground of certain misconceptions and difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is the notion that nationality has anything to do\r\nwith race, in the anthropological sense. There is much to be said for\r\nthe view that the European civilisations owe their development largely\r\nto the mingling of races which has occurred within the area; it is at\r\nleast certain that no European nation, whatever the fervour of its\r\ncitizens' patriotism, is of anthropologically pure race. There is no\r\nBritish race, no French race, no German race, even though the word\r\nGermanic is sometimes applied to one of the strains which occurs in the\r\nGerman Empire. We recognise this fact, of course, in our popular\r\nlanguage, for the contrast between the Briton of Saxon race and the\r\nBriton of Celtic race is a favourite literary topic. Unfortunately for\r\naccuracy, the people within the British area who speak Celtic languages\r\nare not all of the same race, and there is nothing more certain than the\r\nfact that few of them, if any, have any distinct trace of Celtic blood.\r\nAlthough in literature also the comparison between the \"Celts\" of\r\nBrittany and the \"Celts\" of Wales and western Great Britain generally is\r\na favourite one, upon which many deductions have been based, it is\r\ncertain that the Bretons are not homogeneous, and that they have\r\nlanguage but not race in common with the dark-haired Welsh.\r\n\r\nThis naturally leads us to the second point of importance--that language\r\nhas nothing to do with race. In his book on the _Races of Europe_,\r\nRipley illustrates this in a very interesting way by a consideration of\r\nthe languages and races of the Iberian Peninsula. This peninsula shows\r\nat the present time relative purity of race--not absolute purity, for a\r\nmingling has certainly occurred, but nevertheless one race, that which\r\nwe have called Mediterranean, enormously predominates. Yet in spite of\r\nthis relative purity of race, the peninsula is divided between two\r\nnationalities and no less than three languages. Portugal forms a\r\nseparate nation with its own language, while Spain, though forming one\r\nnation, has two languages, Castilian or Spanish, and Catalan. Catalan is\r\nnearly related to Langue d'oc, the language of Provence across the\r\nFrench border. Provençal again, before its gradual displacement by the\r\nLangue d'oeil, or true French, was spoken by men of the Mediterranean as\r\nwell as of the Alpine race. Within both French and Spanish territory\r\nstill another language, Basque, is spoken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--The Iberian Peninsula and part of France, to\r\nshow the distribution of languages, and their independence of political\r\nboundaries. (After Ripley.)]\r\n\r\nIn other words, the almost uniform race of the Iberian peninsula speaks\r\nfour separate tongues, the Portuguese, Castilian, Catalan, and Basque\r\nlanguages, and the political boundary of the Pyrenees separates at its\r\neastern end two groups of Mediterranean man, speaking similar languages,\r\nCatalan or Provençal, the latter of which is also spoken, or was spoken,\r\nin France by the men of another race, the Alpine, found in the uplands\r\nof southern and central France, as well as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nRipley's explanation of the heterogeneity of language combined with\r\nhomogeneity of race in Spain and Portugal is interesting. The peninsula\r\nwas peopled from Africa before the dawn of history, by a division of\r\nthe Mediterranean race called Iberian, which traversed the Strait of\r\nGibraltar. This race established itself firmly in the peninsula and has\r\npersisted there despite infusions of other races from the north and\r\nnorth-east. But the road from Africa remained open, and the region was\r\nconstantly liable to new invasions from the area of its prime origin.\r\nDifferences of culture produced fierce warfare between the incoming and\r\nthe old established race, and led temporarily to the triumph of the\r\ninvaders, known to history as Saracens and Moors. The original Iberians,\r\nlike the people of the same stock in Wales and parts of the Scottish\r\nHighlands, were pushed back to the mountains of Galicia, to the hill\r\ncountry of Castile, to the hills of Aragon and round and over the\r\nPyrenees to Languedoc and the south of France generally. Ultimately they\r\nreasserted themselves, and drove the Moors out of Europe, but the\r\ndriving force was exerted from three different centres, Galicia,\r\nCastile, and Aragon, which, owing to the configuration of the country,\r\nwere isolated from each other. A political accident united Castile and\r\nAragon, and imposed Castilian Spanish on a united Spain as the official\r\nlanguage, but the geographical conditions have led to the long\r\nretention of the Catalan speech, though not of a Catalan nation. The\r\nIberians who found a refuge in the mountains of Galicia, at a later\r\ndate, formed the nucleus of the Portuguese nation.\r\n\r\nWith these preliminary considerations we may pass to the discussion of\r\nwhat is known, or surmised, as to the different races of Europe and\r\ntheir origin.\r\n\r\nThe earliest man who has left traces in Europe is he of the Palæolithic\r\nPeriod, or Old Stone Age, a hunter and cave-dweller without domesticated\r\nanimals, whose traces are especially found in southern Europe. No traces\r\nof his presence have yet been found in Scandinavia or in Scotland, where\r\nthe climatic conditions perhaps made his existence impossible. Not much\r\nis known of this early race, but it seems to have been long-headed, and\r\nwas probably dark. It is no longer believed that there was a complete\r\nrupture between the culture of the Palæolithic period, with its\r\nunpolished stone implements, and that of the Neolithic age, with its\r\npolished implements, but the relations of the two remain somewhat\r\nuncertain. The remains of the Neolithic period are much more extensive\r\nand enable us to draw much more satisfactory conclusions as to racial\r\ncharacters. We shall describe briefly some of these Neolithic remains as\r\nthey appear in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBefore doing this, however, it is necessary to say a few words about the\r\nmeans of recognising different races of men. The criterion most employed\r\nis that of head form, and especially what is known as the cephalic\r\nindex, that is, the ratio between the breadth of the skull between the\r\nears and its length from front to back. The ratio is expressed as a\r\npercentage, the length being taken as 100, and the breadth stated as a\r\nfraction of it. When the index rises above 80, the skull is said to be\r\nbrachycephalic, or rounded; when it is below 75, the skull is long, or\r\ndolichocephalic. The Italian anthropologist, Sergi, adopts another\r\nclassification of skulls, based upon the shape, but this is only a\r\nrefinement of the ordinary distinction between long and round skulls.\r\n\r\nAnother important character, which, like the shape of the skull, can be\r\nmeasured either in the living person or in the skeleton, is the height,\r\nwhich has some racial significance. A third character, of much\r\nimportance, is the colouring of the skin, eyes and hair. This can only\r\nbe inferred in the case of pre-historic peoples. Finally, the shape of\r\nthe features, especially of the nose, has some racial significance.\r\n\r\nIn the west of Great Britain generally, and extending northwards to\r\nOrkney, there occur the burying-places of a Neolithic people, which have\r\nyielded abundant remains, including skeletons. The cairns, tumuli, or\r\nbarrows of this people are recognised by their elongated shape, by the\r\nfact that they are chambered, and by the contained skeletons, which are\r\nalways those of a dolichocephalic people. \"Long barrows, long skulls\" is\r\nan anthropological rule for England and Scotland, no less than for the\r\nother parts of Europe in which these tumuli occur. The skeletons within\r\nthe barrows show no marks of fire, so that inhumation not cremation was\r\npractised, and a very curious feature found in Scotland, in Sicily, in\r\nEgypt and elsewhere, in tombs supposed to be of similar age, is that the\r\nbody is usually placed in a doubled-up position. The position\r\ncorresponds to the pre-natal position of the human infant, and this\r\nmethod of burial is supposed to imply some belief in a future life--is a\r\nrecord of a naïve hope that man could \"enter a second time into his\r\nmother's womb and be born again.\"\r\n\r\nGraves of this type, containing the skeletons of long-headed men,\r\nbelieved to be of the race which we have called Mediterranean, occur not\r\nonly in western Great Britain, but also in France, in Scandinavia, in\r\nGermany, in the Mediterranean basin, and elsewhere. There seems reason\r\nto believe that they prove that in Neolithic times the Mediterranean\r\nrace was widely distributed, especially in the west; it seems, further,\r\ntolerably certain that Mediterranean man himself was an immigrant from\r\nthe north of Africa, and established himself first in the Mediterranean\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\nThe members of this race have now, and apparently have always had, the\r\nfollowing characters:--The skull is markedly dolichocephalic, the skin\r\ntends to be brown, the eyes and hair are dark, the stature is medium and\r\nthe build slight, and the nose is rather broad.\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. Sergi there are four great stocks of this race; of\r\nthese, one remained within Africa, and has been known under various\r\nnames, the ancient Egyptians, the Libyans, the Berbers being all of this\r\nstock. The other three stocks invaded Europe, entering by the three\r\nnatural routes which present themselves, that is, by the three regions\r\nwhere the sea is most easily crossed. The most western group, the\r\nIberians, crossed, as we have seen, _via_ Gibraltar, and occupied the\r\nIberian peninsula. The next group, the Ligurians, found an entrance into\r\nEurope _via_ Sicily, and passing up into Italy extended westwards along\r\nthe Riviera, till they encountered the Iberians in southern France.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third group, the Pelasgians, reached Greece by means of the\r\nislands of that part of the Mediterranean. It still remains uncertain\r\nwhether an earlier migration still had peopled Europe with Palæolithic\r\nman, who, on this theory, would belong also to the Mediterranean race,\r\nor whether the immigrant African race displaced some earlier unrelated\r\npopulation. In any case, it is tolerably certain that the first peopling\r\nof Europe on any considerable scale was the result of this immigration\r\nof Mediterranean man.\r\n\r\nHe doubtless first established himself on the margin of the great sea,\r\nand there became thoroughly suited to his environment. Later he spread\r\nnorthwards, being no doubt especially attracted by the relatively mild\r\nclimate of the west, by what has been called the \"winter gulf of\r\nwarmth\" which extends over north-western Europe.\r\n\r\nWhatever was the cause of his northward trend, however, Mediterranean\r\nman does not appear to have been left long in undisturbed possession of\r\nhis acquired territory. In Scotland, in the Clyde valley, which is\r\ntypical of many other parts of Europe, round barrows or cairns are found\r\nside by side with the long ones. These are of later origin, as is shown\r\nby the nature of the pottery, by the occurrence of ornaments, and\r\nespecially by the presence of bronze weapons--a great advance upon\r\nstone. The skeletons in these cairns mostly show marks of fire,\r\nsuggesting that cremation was practised, and the skulls are those of a\r\nround-headed race. \"Round barrows mean round skulls\" is a second\r\nanthropological maxim for Britain.\r\n\r\nThese barrows are the first traces of the second great European race,\r\ncalled Alpine, Celtic, Eurasiatic, or Celto-Slavic by different\r\nanthropologists. The members of this race are of medium height, but are\r\nmore stoutly built than Mediterranean man. Though generally resembling\r\nhim in the coloration of hair and eyes, they are lighter in tint, the\r\nhair tending to be chestnut-coloured, and the eyes hazel grey, instead\r\nof both being very dark as in the former race. The nose, though\r\nvariable, is in living types usually rather broad, and the special\r\nfeature is of course the round head and broad face. As one of the names\r\ngiven indicates, this race is supposed by most anthropologists to have\r\nbeen of Asiatic origin.\r\n\r\nWhere the two sets of barrows occur there are indications that the\r\nincoming race greatly influenced the culture of the old. The use of\r\nbronze must have given its members an enormous advantage in the struggle\r\nfor existence, and they seem to have imposed their customs, burial and\r\nother, and apparently also their language, on the older race.\r\n\r\nThis conflict of races which has left its traces in the Clyde valley\r\napparently occurred in other parts of Europe. Everywhere the new race\r\nimposed its language and its customs upon the old, and everywhere its\r\nappearance is associated with a change and a rise in culture. It is\r\npresumed by the majority that this Alpine race brought with it the use\r\nof bronze, and was therefore at a higher level than Mediterranean man,\r\nbut Prof. Sergi believes that the appearance of bronze and of the new\r\nrace simultaneously was a mere coincidence, and that the Mediterranean\r\nrace itself originated the use of metals. Meantime there is no means of\r\ndeciding this question, which in any case is not of supreme importance,\r\nbut what seems clear is that everywhere, except in the Mediterranean\r\nbasin, the new race pressed the old one hard, whether by its skill in\r\nthe arts of peace or in those of war remains uncertain. Even in the\r\nMediterranean the old languages went down before that of Alpine man.\r\n\r\nIn the Mediterranean area the new-comers seized the upland regions, that\r\nis, as we have suggested, the regions of pasture, and ousted the\r\nlongheads permanently from them. In Spain and Portugal, perhaps because\r\nof the vicinity of the reservoir of the race in North Africa,\r\nMediterranean man kept his hold, and the brachycephalic forms did not\r\nsucceed in obtaining much foothold. But they are strongly represented in\r\nparts of southern France. In southern Italy, in Sicily, Corsica and\r\nSardinia Mediterranean man largely kept out the intruders, though they\r\nappear again on the Alpine slopes of the north of Italy. But in the\r\neastern Mediterranean the dark longheads are hard pressed and have kept\r\nlittle save the seaboard from the broadheads.\r\n\r\nOutside the Mediterranean area, the success of Alpine man was more\r\ncheckered, but we are met with the difficulty that here a third race\r\nsupervened later, so that existing conditions are not necessarily\r\ncomparable to earlier conditions.\r\n\r\nAt the present time Alpine man occupies almost all the upland and\r\ntherefore relatively infertile regions of France, especially Savoy and\r\nthe Dauphiny, the central uplands, and parts (not the whole) of\r\nBrittany. Outliers of this race also occur in other regions, _e. g._ in\r\nparts of the Saône valley, which is not infertile. In Great Britain,\r\ndespite their first success, the broadlands have left little trace on\r\nthe existing population. We thus see the absurdity of talking about\r\nBritish Celts, for Celts in the true sense are almost extinct in Britain\r\nthough their language remains and is spoken by types of Mediterranean\r\nman as well as by others. In Scandinavia Alpine man was more successful,\r\nfor he has left traces in various parts, especially on the coast of\r\nNorway. Throughout Belgium and in Southern Germany the broad-headed\r\nelement in the population is very strong, while in Austria, the Balkan\r\nStates and Russia this race predominates and is no longer confined to\r\nelevated or infertile regions. This increase in numbers and in dominance\r\ntowards the east is one of the facts which lead anthropologists to\r\nbelieve that Alpine man is of Asiatic origin.\r\n\r\nWe shall return to him in a moment, but meantime it is necessary to\r\nspeak of the third element in Europe, the race variously called Nordic,\r\nTeutonic, or even Germanic, in spite of the fact that many Germans\r\nbelong to the Alpine race. The members of this race are remarkable for\r\ntheir tall stature, for their long skulls and face, for their blue eyes\r\nand fair hair, their light complexions, and their narrow aquiline noses.\r\nThe resemblance in skull form leads many anthropologists to regard them\r\nas derived from a common stock with the Mediterranean race, but the race\r\nseems to have originated in Europe. The place and date of its origin are\r\nstill quite uncertain. It is possible that it was produced from an early\r\nform of the Mediterranean race in adaptation to the moist climate of\r\nwestern Europe. Ripley gives Scandinavia as the probable place of\r\norigin, but meantime there can be no certainty.\r\n\r\nWhat we do know is that this race shows as perfect an adaptation to the\r\nclimate of forest-clad temperate Europe as Mediterranean man does to\r\nthe dry climate of that region. Just as the border of the Mediterranean\r\nis the province of Mediterranean man, and has been his for countless\r\nages, so north-western Europe is the almost unchallenged possession of\r\nNordic man. Between the two, along the great wedge of uplands, is the\r\nland of Alpine man, which widens to the east, his original home. Just as\r\nMediterranean man in the days of his prime pushed north wherever\r\nconditions permitted, so Nordic man has pushed south, across the Alpine\r\nbarrier, both in the literal and anthropological sense, and has left\r\ntraces of his coming even within the territory of Mediterranean man.\r\nJust as the dark-haired Welsh and the dark-haired strain of Scottish\r\nHighlanders bear witness to the old exploits of Mediterranean man, so do\r\nthe fair-haired, tall-statured Lombards bear witness to the former\r\nactivity of Nordic man. Nevertheless, the main territory of the two\r\nraces is widely separated.\r\n\r\nThe relation of these two types, at least, to their zones of\r\ndistribution is relatively easy to explain. Mediterranean man is highly\r\nsusceptible to diseases of the breathing-organs to which the fair-haired\r\nNordic type is more resistant. Here is one possible explanation of\r\ntheir command of their respective habitats, and there are many others.\r\nThe forest-dwelling Nordic type, as Prof. Penck points out, must\r\nnecessarily have had the family as the unit, for only by dwelling in\r\nsmall family groups can primitive man war against the forest.\r\nMediterranean man, with his early use of irrigation, had necessarily to\r\nevolve a larger unit, for irrigation means extensive co-operation, so\r\nthat political organisations would arise early in the Mediterranean. We\r\ncan hardly doubt that these two facts had some bearing on the survival\r\nrate of the two races. The Nordic race with their strong family life,\r\nand with their abundant pasturage, had doubtless a relatively low\r\ndeath-rate among the children, though, as Prof. Myres points out, the\r\nstruggle in adult life must have been keen. In the Mediterranean, as he\r\nalso notes, the dry summer means difficulties with the water supply,\r\ndifficulties in sanitation, and the risk of pestilence, which, with the\r\nabundant supply of fruit and the absence or scarcity of milk, has\r\nprobably always meant a very high death-rate among the children. But the\r\nfact that the struggle for existence among adults was much less keen\r\nthan among the forest folk, perhaps prevented this high infantile\r\ndeath-rate from being a great handicap. Once the geographical\r\nsurroundings of the two peoples were changed by migration, the qualities\r\nwhich aided them to survive in their native habitat might become a\r\npositive hindrance. In brief, as two types evolved in harmony with\r\nwell-defined geographical conditions, the very perfectness of their\r\nrespective adaptations would hinder either from appropriating the\r\nterritory of the other, while leaving a considerable margin for struggle\r\non the debatable land between the two geographical regions.\r\n\r\nIf it seems at the present day that the Nordic race has more than passed\r\nthe Mediterranean in the race of life, we must remember that the fact\r\nthat coal is chiefly found in the territory of the former, has given it\r\nan enormous economic advantage in recent times, an advantage which it\r\nmay not be able to keep.\r\n\r\nThe Alpine race presents a much more difficult problem. We have said\r\nnothing here of the so-called Aryan problem, because the whole\r\nconception of an Aryan race advancing from Asia with a ready-made\r\nculture, and imposing it upon a barbarian Europe, is somewhat out of\r\ndate, and much that has been written on the subject of the Aryans\r\npreceded in time the disentanglement of the complex problems presented\r\nby European races. But with all deductions made, the incoming Asiatic\r\nrace which we have called Alpine presents many curious problems. It\r\nseems probable that the languages of Europe are largely due to the\r\ngrafting of Alpine or Eurasian tongues upon the different tongues\r\nalready spoken by Mediterranean man. We have still in Britain a Celtic\r\nlanguage, though it is spoken by people of Mediterranean characters, and\r\nit is an extraordinary fact that a people should impose its language and\r\nculture upon another race, and yet be itself unable to keep its footing\r\namong that race.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the new-comers, in Britain at least, were\r\nnever more than an aristocracy, and that they disappeared by the\r\nmingling of their blood with the indigenous people, after having long\r\ndominated them. That is, it was as if we might suppose that the British\r\npopulation in India was cut off from the mother country, and ultimately\r\ndisappeared owing to intermarriage, while their language and their\r\ncustoms remained in greatly modified form and replaced the existing\r\nlanguages and customs.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in regard to this hypothesis are twofold. In the first\r\nplace, such a hypothesis of mingling seems inconsistent with the\r\nextraordinary persistency which this race has manifested in other parts\r\nof Europe, where it came into contact with the same races as in Britain;\r\nand, second, the position of the Alpine race in western Europe\r\ngenerally, its virtual limitation to relatively infertile land, seems\r\ninconsistent with the notion that it ever formed an aristocracy, apart\r\nfrom and above the other races. To-day in Germany it is so far from\r\noccupying the position of an aristocracy that it sometimes forms the\r\nlower classes to a Nordic dominant class, though the Alpine race is\r\nsometimes stated to be better adapted to town life than the Nordic.\r\n\r\nOf the three races, Mediterranean man seems to be perfectly adapted to a\r\ndry region, with deficient pasture, naturally clothed with a\r\ndrought-resisting type of forest. As he prospered he spread beyond his\r\nown region, with the result that he reached a region markedly different\r\nin climate and vegetation from his own, to which his adaptation was\r\nnever very perfect. Where, as in Ireland and western Great Britain, the\r\nconditions permitted the natural growth of some of the Mediterranean\r\nplants, there his hold was fairly firm, elsewhere it must always have\r\nbeen loose and uncertain.\r\n\r\nInto a Europe thus peopled, with probably large vacant spaces, came a\r\npastoral type of man from Asia, certainly a transporter, if not an\r\noriginator, of a higher culture, best fitted for a region of pasture\r\nland, but better fitted than Mediterranean man to withstand cold. He\r\nfilled the spaces which Mediterranean man could not fill, and pressed\r\nhim hard in many places. Ultimately the forest region of Europe evolved\r\nits own type, perhaps from some aberrant strain of Mediterranean man,\r\nand this type, perfectly fitted to the forest regions, conquered the\r\nnorth and west, driving Alpine man up to the hills, and largely\r\ndisplacing Mediterranean man except where distinctively Mediterranean\r\ninfluences prevailed.\r\n\r\nTo the east, as the European forest dies away into the steppes of Asia,\r\nNordic man can no longer compete successfully with Alpine man, and\r\ndiminishes in numbers and in strength.\r\n\r\nThus while in Germany the tendency is for the tall, fair longheads of\r\nthe north to dominate the short, darker broadheads of the south, further\r\nto the east this same broad-headed race, under the banner of Panslavism,\r\nstrives, not unsuccessfully, to dominate the longheads of Finland and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThus below and beneath the warfare of race is the contrast of physical\r\nconditions, which have produced the various types of man, no less than\r\nof plants and animals, and from which man cannot fully emancipate\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe New World was first colonised by Mediterranean man, but later all\r\nthe European races contributed their part to its peopling. When we add a\r\nstrong negro element in the southern United States, a remnant of the\r\noriginal Indian population, and an infusion of eastern races, it is\r\nobvious that the mingling of blood which has apparently produced good\r\nresults in Europe, is being carried out on a much more elaborate scale\r\nacross the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nOne other point may be touched upon. We have shown that the nations of\r\nEurope are not races in the pure sense. But, at the same time, it may be\r\nnoted that in the western nations one or other of the two chief races\r\ntends to predominate at the expense of the other.\r\n\r\nThus broadly we may say that the antagonism between the French and\r\nGerman nationalities is fed by the fact that in race, in culture, in\r\ntradition, the one is predominantly Mediterranean, and the other\r\npredominantly Teutonic. In the Iberian peninsula, as we have seen, the\r\nMediterranean strain enormously predominates, while in the countries of\r\nthe north-west the Teutonic race tends to overbalance the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF MINERALS AND THE LOCALISATION OF INDUSTRIES AND OF\r\nTOWNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distribution of minerals over the surface of the earth is much less\r\nobvious phenomenon than that of plants and animals, but it has always\r\nbeen of great importance in determining the distribution of man and his\r\nsettlements. Except in the most primitive communities man must have\r\ntools and implements; probably never since he became man has he been\r\nwithout weapons. The first sign of emergence from the rudest barbarism\r\nis the use of metals, instead of stone or bone, to construct these tools\r\nand weapons and the necessity for finding the metals best suited to his\r\nuse at each stage of civilisation has always influenced the movements\r\nand settlements of man. The existence of useful metals in a particular\r\narea must always attract population to that spot, and it is obvious in\r\nthe case of Australia, of California, and later of Alaska, how strong\r\nthe attractive power of metals is, even when the other conditions are\r\ndistinctly unfavourable. As metals have always had this attractive\r\npower, the study of their distribution must always be important to the\r\ngeographer.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the first men whose remains have been preserved in\r\nEurope used only implements of stone, but that at a later state bronze\r\nwas used, and corresponded to a marked rise in civilisation, as shown by\r\nthe improved pottery, the nature of the ornaments used, and so on.\r\n\r\nNow bronze is not a metal but an alloy or mixture of two metals, copper\r\nand tin. This alloy is very hard, and possesses qualities which make it\r\nmore valuable for weapons and tools than the relatively soft metal\r\ncopper. But we can hardly suppose that the first metal-workers\r\ndiscovered, immediately after they had learnt how to smelt metals, that\r\na mixture of metals was more useful than a pure one. In point of fact,\r\nit is clear that in some places, at least, the age of bronze was\r\npreceded by a period when developing man used pure copper for his\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nOur word copper is derived from the name of the island of Cyprus, which\r\nis particularly rich in copper ores. In this island they were smelted at\r\na very early date, the process being aided by two facts, first, that\r\ncopper ores are relatively easy to smelt, and, second, that the\r\nnecessary fuel for the process was furnished by the forests which\r\nformerly covered the island, and which were largely destroyed by the\r\nearly smiths.\r\n\r\nFor our purpose it is quite unnecessary to discuss the difficult and\r\ndebated question as to where the use of copper and bronze originated. It\r\nis sufficient to note that the island of Cyprus, placed near early\r\ncentres of civilisation seems to have been the region from which a\r\nknowledge of the pure metal and of its more useful alloy radiated over\r\nthe Mediterranean and ultimately over Europe generally. It is more than\r\nprobable that the use of copper or of bronze spread faster than the\r\nknowledge of the method of producing either. It is at least clear that\r\nin many cases the Stone and Bronze Ages co-existed, suggesting that the\r\nnew type of implements was at first very difficult to obtain. No doubt\r\nfor long ages they occupied the position which firearms long occupied\r\namong savage races, and which they still occupy among those most remote\r\nfrom civilisation.\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus itself very few stone implements occur, suggesting that the\r\nStone Age was very short, and rapidly gave place to a metal one.\r\n\r\nWe do not know how the discovery was made that the addition of tin\r\nimproved copper for human purposes. Bronzes of very varying composition\r\nhave been found, including many which contain antimony, a somewhat rare\r\nmetal, still employed in making many useful alloys. It is suggested that\r\nthe first smiths tried a great number of combinations before they found\r\none which was satisfactory, and finally fixed upon tin as the most\r\nsuitable addition.\r\n\r\nThe next point of interest is the source of the tin. This is a question\r\nof great interest, for long after iron had been used, and used\r\nextensively in the manufacture of implements, the demand for bronze\r\ncontinued, for the iron, even of late Roman days, was very costly and\r\nprobably very troublesome to make. Bronze also became of importance in\r\nconnection with the coinage of civilised nations.\r\n\r\nTin is not a very abundant metal, and it is rare in the Mediterranean.\r\nThe deposits which were utilised by the first makers of bronze have\r\ndoubtless completely disappeared, for from the early days of\r\ncivilisation the tin deposits even of Far Britain were sought.\r\n\r\nWithin the Mediterranean region at the present time only one tin deposit\r\nof any importance is known. This occurs in the village of Montecatini,\r\nwhich is situated near Volterra in Italy, in the ancient Etruria. It\r\nperhaps played a part in connection with the development of the\r\ncivilisation of ancient Etruria.\r\n\r\nOutside of the Mediterranean the main deposits of tin in Europe occur,\r\nor occurred, in three separate areas, which formed as it were three\r\nstages in one journey, and whose position certainly made them a factor\r\nin promoting the spread of Mediterranean culture to the north-west.\r\n\r\nThese three rich tin-bearing areas were: (1) Galicia in north-western\r\nSpain, (2) the south of Brittany, especially between the estuaries of\r\nthe Loire and the Vilaine, a deposit long since exhausted, and (3) the\r\nstill-important deposits of southern England, in Cornwall and parts of\r\nDevon, which are believed to have been visited by the Phoenicians. Just\r\nas the gold of California brought population and civilisation to the Far\r\nWest of North America long before the natural increase of eastern\r\npeoples would have led to a westward movement, so the rich tin deposits\r\nof south-western Britain, with the other metals of those favoured\r\nislands, brought merchants and navigators to what was the Far West of\r\nancient Europe.\r\n\r\nThe bold navigators who had learnt their craft in the Mediterranean Sea\r\nleft its basin by the Strait of Gibraltar, and visited successively\r\nthose masses of ancient rocks which project out into the ocean, and form\r\nthe western extremities of Spain, France and Britain. But it was not\r\nonly the sea route which was utilised, at least in later times. Perhaps\r\nso long ago as five centuries before our era a land route was organised\r\nwhich carried British tin to Marseilles, and thus to the Mediterranean.\r\nThe great valley of the Rhone renders such a traverse of France\r\nfeasible, and the passage from the valley to the Rhone to that of the\r\nLoire or of the Seine is easy. The existence of a commerce in tin thus\r\nensured that France was early and deeply permeated by Mediterranean\r\ncivilisation, for it involved the existence of high roads through her\r\nland, at a time when northern Europe generally was cut off from the\r\ncivilisation of the Mediterranean. There is even reason to believe that\r\ntrade in tin led to the founding of an early maritime power on the\r\nbarren shores of Brittany. The trade in tin certainly did much to open\r\nthe way for the future civilisation of France.\r\n\r\nThough, as we have indicated, bronze was for long of relatively great\r\nimportance, yet the use of iron dates back to great antiquity. It seems\r\nto have been a rare and precious metal when the Homeric poems took\r\nshape, and for long afterwards its use was partial and limited. The\r\nfact, however, that it is very readily destroyed by rust when exposed to\r\nair and damp, makes it difficult to draw any certain conclusions from\r\nits absence in ancient remains.\r\n\r\nThe slow growth of the use of iron must be largely ascribed to the great\r\ndifficulties in smelting it, especially when it occurs in impure forms.\r\nIron does not occur in the pure state, as copper does to a small extent,\r\nbut it is enormously abundant, being found, to a greater or less extent,\r\nin almost all rocks. Relatively pure ores are rare, most iron-bearing\r\nminerals containing a large number of impurities, some of which are very\r\ndifficult to remove. Further, the process of smelting always requires\r\nmuch fuel, and, in the case of the more impure ores, remarkable skill\r\nand science. The result was that the early smiths could only employ a\r\nvery high grade of ore; all others were useless to them. Even with a\r\nhigh grade of ore, they could only extract a relatively small amount of\r\nthe iron present.\r\n\r\nA very curious little proof of this latter fact is furnished by the\r\nRoman iron workings in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. The refuse\r\nthrown out of the ancient furnaces worked by the Romans here, was\r\nre-smelted by the British smiths long centuries afterwards, and this\r\nrefuse fed their furnaces for a period of between two and three hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe next point of interest in regard to iron is the source of the\r\nnecessary fuel. At first wood or charcoal was always employed, and\r\ntherefore iron could only be smelted in the vicinity of forests. Thus\r\nthe Forest of Dean, already mentioned, supplied the wood used by the\r\nRomans in smelting, and the trees of the Weald or \"wood\" of Sussex and\r\nKent were completely removed during the long centuries when the iron\r\nores of that region were smelted. The Forest of Arden, near Birmingham,\r\nis another region where iron was long smelted by the aid of charcoal.\r\nThe amount of fuel required, especially in the early days, was very\r\ngreat, and as the forests were cleared without any regard for scientific\r\nforestry, it naturally followed that in many districts the destruction\r\nof the necessary fuel led to a diminution of the industry.\r\n\r\nIn England coal was not generally employed in the smelting of iron until\r\nafter the middle of the eighteenth century, and long before that the\r\nBritish forests had been largely destroyed. The result was that the\r\nBritish iron industry had declined, and in the early part of that\r\ncentury considerably more iron was imported than was made in England.\r\nThe countries which at this time were specially favoured in connection\r\nwith the industry were those in which pure iron ores co-existed with\r\nextensive forests. This condition occurred especially in Germany, where\r\nthe iron deposits formerly worked were those of the upland regions which\r\nhave kept their forests till this day. Thus the wood and the ores of the\r\nHarz Mountains and of the Erzgebirge, or Iron Mountains, were of great\r\nimportance before the industrial revolution, and up till the early part\r\nof the eighteenth century the German iron industry was more important\r\nthan the British.\r\n\r\nThe replacement of charcoal by coal led to a great diminution of the\r\ncost of production, and permitted the use of low-grade ores, but it was\r\nnot in itself a great improvement. Charcoal is a singularly pure form of\r\ncarbon, and its use as the reducing agent gives a high quality of iron.\r\nCoal, on the other hand, often contains impurities which spoil the iron,\r\nand have to be provided against in various ways. Not all coal, indeed,\r\nis suitable for iron smelting. The result is that where charcoal can\r\nstill be obtained cheaply, as in the Scandinavian countries and in parts\r\nof Russia, it is still used in smelting, and the iron so produced is\r\nparticularly valuable.\r\n\r\nThe original demand for iron, as we have seen, was very small, and even\r\ndown to the middle of the eighteenth century remained insignificant. But\r\nwith the use of machinery, the spread of railways, the replacement of\r\nwood by iron in shipbuilding and for the framework of buildings, etc.,\r\nthe demand in all civilised communities has become enormous, has become\r\ntoo great to permit of any forests supplying the necessary fuel. With\r\nthe far increased demand has come an elaboration of methods which means\r\nvery costly installations and much skill and training among the workers.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the industrial revolution till the present, then, a\r\nwell-developed iron industry has demanded the following:--fuel, usually\r\nfurnished by coal; an abundant supply of the ore, either furnished\r\nlocally or easily obtained by water carriage, ores being so bulky that\r\nland carriage is rarely profitable; certain accessories, notedly\r\nlimestone to serve as a flux, and ganister, a kind of sandstone used to\r\nform a lining in parts of the apparatus used; capital, necessary for the\r\npurchase and fitting up of the costly plant; the tradition and skill\r\nwhich come from the long practice of the industry.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these various necessaries may perhaps be realised by\r\na few examples. Let us consider first the Mediterranean area. We have\r\nseen that it was civilised from a very early date, that a considerable\r\npart at least of that civilisation was indigenous, and that its early\r\nsmiths showed no lack of skill. But with the advent of the age of iron\r\nits natural handicap became obvious. The forests of the region never had\r\nthe luxuriance of those further north, and must have been early\r\ndestroyed, and coal is virtually absent. Iron ores are present and are\r\nwidely distributed; some, like those of Elba and of northern Spain,\r\nwhich is outside the area, are even rich; but the absence of fuel is a\r\nterrible handicap, and to its absence we must ascribe the present\r\npoverty and backwardness of Mediterranean countries.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, however, that electricity is coming to be used in\r\nsmelting, and especially for making particular kinds of steel, used for\r\nspecial purposes. To generate this electricity water power is being\r\nused, and the appearance of small factories in the valleys of the Alpine\r\nborder, both in France and Italy, perhaps marks the beginning of a\r\nchange which will restore to some of the Mediterranean countries their\r\nancient glory.\r\n\r\nThese small factories are not only employed in manufacturing high-grade\r\nsteel, but also in making nitrogenous manure from the air, and in other\r\nprocesses. In the valleys in which they occur the inhabitants are\r\nforsaking their phylloxera-infested vineyards for the factories, and the\r\nassociation of the neglected land with the busy factories offers a very\r\ncurious spectacle, and suggests that the twentieth century may see great\r\nchanges in the present distribution of population.\r\n\r\nMeantime this distribution has been almost everywhere in western Europe\r\nenormously influenced by the distribution of coal. Everywhere the coal\r\nhas had an attractive influence, dragging population, wealth, and\r\nintelligence from the agricultural regions, even the fertile regions, to\r\nthe vicinity of the coal measures, where alone great industries can be\r\nprofitably established.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, where the coal-bearing beds are not only numerous, but\r\nin some instances crop out at the surface, coal seems to have been\r\nworked earlier than elsewhere in Europe. To its earlier utilisation of\r\ncoal on a large scale Britain owes its long lead in the struggle for\r\nindustrial supremacy, and we thus find the effect of coal upon the\r\ndistribution of the population illustrated in a more striking way here\r\nthan elsewhere. Further, Great Britain is especially fortunate in that\r\niron usually occurs in close proximity to coal, and that the other\r\nnecessities for an iron industry are easily obtainable. Its position,\r\nsheltered by Ireland, gives it good ports, and it is rich in other\r\nminerals as well as in iron ores and coal.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the change introduced by the great industrial revolution\r\nmay be realised, for example, by thinking of the great cathedrals of\r\nEngland, and noting how insignificant the towns in which they are placed\r\nare at the present day when compared with the great centres which have\r\nsprung up near the coalfields. Yet the very existence of these\r\nmagnificent monuments of the past means that in the old days the towns\r\nin which they were placed were not only centres of population and of\r\nwealth, but had also prestige enough to draw men's eyes towards them.\r\nTheir very peace and cleanliness to-day means that the life of the\r\nnation is eddying round other centres. The emotions which found\r\nexpression in their lofty spires now seek another outlet in the\r\nmagnificent municipal buildings, the art galleries, the hospitals, the\r\nuniversities and schools of the industrial centres.\r\n\r\nThe same lesson may be learnt by considering the county towns of some of\r\nthe counties where the change wrought by the industrial revolution has\r\nbeen greatest. What do the towns of Alnwick, Durham, York, Lancaster,\r\nAppleby, Carlisle now signify beside the great towns in Yorkshire and\r\nLancashire, which depend for their existence upon the coalfields?\r\n\r\nThe great development of North America is similarly the product of the\r\nage of iron and coal, and therefore here also population tends to\r\ncongregate round mineralised regions, and to be sucked away from the\r\nearly centres, which were determined by other causes.\r\n\r\nIn brief we say that it is true generally of the civilised world that\r\nthe attraction of the towns, of which we hear so much, is in reality the\r\nattraction of minerals, especially of coal and iron. This attractive\r\npower of minerals is no new thing. When the men armed with bronze or\r\ncopper weapons and tools conquered those with stone implements, when\r\niron was found to be better than all three, then first began that long\r\nprocess which now acts by sucking the countryman into the large\r\nindustrial towns.\r\n\r\nWhen coal became supremely important the small industries, previously\r\nscattered over the localities where some specially favourable conditions\r\npresented themselves, began to concentrate near the coalfields. With the\r\ncheap power they developed out of all proportion to their old state, and\r\nnew industries were added to the old. Thus began that process which made\r\nthe great manufacturing nations seek markets far beyond their own\r\nshores, and produce far in excess of their own needs. This, again, has\r\nled to enormous improvements in the means of communication. It must\r\nitself, however, be necessarily a more or less temporary phenomenon, to\r\nbe replaced sooner or later by other conditions, as the new nations\r\nbecome manufacturers in their turn, and cease to offer unlimited markets\r\nto the old.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the localisation of industries, it is interesting to note\r\nthat though the industries are attracted towards coal, local conditions\r\ngenerally determine which industry or industries shall prosper round a\r\nparticular coalfield. The moist climate of Lancashire, with the relative\r\nproximity of the cotton supplies of the Southern United States, has\r\ndetermined the cotton industry of Lancashire. Once established the\r\nadvantages associated with a going concern make it very difficult for\r\nother districts to capture trade, even when they have greater natural\r\nadvantages, _e. g._ the Southern States themselves are now manufacturing\r\nareas, but cannot compete on equal terms with Lancashire.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed remarkable that the proximity of raw material, except in\r\ncases when this is very bulky, as with ores, seems often to be of minor\r\nimportance in localising industries. Thus, though Belfast may be said\r\nto owe its linen industry primarily to local supplies of flax, it is\r\nnoticeable that the local supply is very limited, and several towns on\r\nthe east coast of Scotland, as Dunfermline, Montrose, Arbroath, etc.,\r\nhave a flourishing linen industry maintained entirely by imported raw\r\nmaterial. A whole host of facts of this kind emphasise the importance of\r\npower in the case of a modern industry, as contrasted with the supreme\r\nimportance of abundant raw material in the old days when man himself\r\nchiefly supplied the motive force.\r\n\r\nIn other words, modern industry has been very closely associated with\r\nimproved means of communication, which alone make it possible to carry\r\ncheap raw material over great distances, without excessive expense for\r\nfreight. The study of the development of the means of communication is\r\ntherefore a problem well worth the attention of the geographer, and is\r\none which has many interesting facts to disclose.\r\n\r\nMan himself is an animal relatively ill-adapted for continuous rapid\r\nmovement or for the transport of goods. As a transport animal he is the\r\ncostliest and most inefficient known, and were it not for the\r\nintelligence which enabled him first to utilise other animals for his\r\nown purposes, and later to find mechanical means, the progress of\r\ncivilisation would have been impossible. Progress in Africa has been\r\ngreatly checked by the fact that over a large area man is the only\r\ntransport animal available, a fact which brings in its train the slave\r\ntrade, and many other serious evils.\r\n\r\nExcept in certain special localities the surface of the earth is so\r\nuneven that progression, especially for a loaded man or animal, is very\r\ndifficult except on a prepared surface. On the other hand, the\r\ndiminution of friction over a water surface makes transport over it\r\nrelatively easy. It has been pointed out that, as a result of this fact,\r\nthe great civilisations have developed in regions where water transport\r\nwas possible, and have involved the progressive utilisation of larger\r\nand larger masses of water.\r\n\r\nThe first civilisations developed in river valleys, where water\r\ntransport in one direction at least is very easy. The next stage was\r\nthat which saw man settled on the shores of the great inland sea, and\r\nwitnessed his gradual acquisition of greater and greater skill in\r\nnavigation. As we have seen, he was soon not content with that sea\r\nalone, but launched out into the open, and, hugging the coastline, found\r\nhis way to far Britain.\r\n\r\nOnly at a very much later date, however, did he conquer the vast\r\nAtlantic outside, which, as Prof. Myres points out, has now become a\r\nmere inland sea in its turn, when compared with the greater oceans\r\nbeyond. To this day, however, the part which water transport plays in\r\nhuman life is reflected in the way in which the denser masses of mankind\r\ncluster round the shores of the seas and oceans, as any map of the\r\ndistribution of population will show.\r\n\r\nIn water transport the method of propelling the vessel employed is of\r\ngreat importance. In river navigation it is natural to allow the boat to\r\ndrift with the current, and the use of a pole to steer with would\r\nnaturally suggest its use as a paddle or oar in order to move against\r\nthe current. In North America up till the appearance of the white man,\r\nthe aborigines had not got past the paddle stage, in spite of the fact\r\nthat they were very skilful navigators, and had a considerable variety\r\nof vessels.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is of course the sail, used by most races who venture on\r\nopen water, as contrasted with flowing streams and rivers. Although\r\nbefore its virtual replacement by steam, the civilised races had carried\r\nthe development of the sail to a very high pitch, yet the difficulties\r\nassociated with it militated against bold navigation, more especially in\r\nthe early days when there was no science of meteorology. Thus it has\r\nbeen pointed out that the reason why the effective discovery of America\r\nwas delayed so long was largely due to two meteorological facts. The\r\nfirst of these is that to the north, the place where the crossing is\r\nnarrowest, the ice which streams down the west coast of Greenland, and\r\neven to this day presents difficulties to navigation off the coasts of\r\nNewfoundland, formed an effective barrier to early navigators. To the\r\nsouth the great difficulty was the constant north-east trade wind. What\r\nship dare set out towards the unknown blown by a constant wind against\r\nwhich she could not return home again? To Columbus first, says Mr.\r\nMackinder, came the brilliant inspiration that, while travelling\r\noutwards with the trade, it would be possible to return with the\r\nwesterly breezes of more northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nWhen, later, the sail was functionally replaced by steam, man became\r\nvirtually independent of the wind, and only the name of trade wind\r\nremains to carry us back to the period when the ocean breezes determined\r\nhis movements and his commerce.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the surface of the land, we may note that regions which\r\nare snow-covered in winter offer special facilities for rapid\r\nlocomotion. In the northern part of North America, both in the tundra\r\nand the forest region, the aborigines used both snow-shoes and sledges.\r\nThe Eskimos to the north use dogs to draw their heavy sledges, but to\r\nthe south the Indians used a lighter form of sledge, which was dragged\r\nby women, and therefore represents a much more primitive form of\r\ntransport. Even down to the present time the conditions in Arctic\r\nAmerica are such that transport facilities are very much greater in\r\nwinter than in summer, except in regions close to navigable rivers.\r\n\r\nSnow-sledges and snow-shoes of course occur also on the European side of\r\nthe Atlantic to the north, but the domesticated reindeer replaces the\r\ndog in Lapland as the means of traction, though dogs are used in other\r\nparts of the tundra region of the old world.\r\n\r\nApart from snow-covered regions deserts afford another example of areas\r\nin which the surface is frequently so uniform that friction is greatly\r\nreduced, and rapid movement is possible without specially prepared\r\ntracks. In the Sahara, for example, which is far from being the waste of\r\nsand which is popularly imagined, there are great areas of almost level\r\nsurface, where \"the soil is firm and elastic, strewn with gravel, and\r\nlike a garden walk.\" In Algiers it is possible to drive in high\r\ndog-carts over the plateau region in any direction, regardless of roads,\r\nand in parts of the North American desert the same thing is true. It has\r\nbeen suggested, indeed, that wheeled vehicles were invented by races\r\nliving near desert regions, and that the invention thus preceded the\r\nmaking of roads.\r\n\r\nIn the general case, however, rapid movement is bound up with the\r\nexistence of roads or tracks. In parts of North America, notably in the\r\nregion south and east of the Great Lakes, where the rivers are generally\r\nunsuitable for navigation by very primitive forms of boats, the original\r\nIndian inhabitants mostly moved by means of \"trails\" through the woods.\r\nThese trails were the lines of migration of the larger mammals,\r\nespecially of the bison, and it is a remarkable fact that the roads made\r\nlater by the white immigrants sometimes followed these old trails,\r\nwhich proved to be the most convenient routes. This suggests one method\r\nin which roads and paths might originate, but the Indian trails, like\r\nthe African negroes' paths through the forest, were excessively narrow\r\nand inconvenient.\r\n\r\nAnother stage in road evolution is well illustrated in many mountain\r\nregions, _i. e._ in the less-frequented parts of the Alps. Here the\r\nmountains are crossed by narrow tracks, which die away at intervals and\r\nthen reappear. They are chiefly used by the herdsmen and cattle, during\r\nthe periodical migrations to the higher pastures, and this fact gives\r\nrise to certain peculiarities. Where the region traversed is very steep\r\nthe path is usually well marked, and there may be even attempts to\r\nimprove difficult parts so as to render it more practicable. When the\r\nground becomes more level the path dies away, or divides up into a\r\nmultitude of minor tracks. The reason is obvious. In the steep regions\r\nthe cows must keep together, and their constant journeyings render the\r\nroad well marked. It must also be easy enough to permit of the passage\r\nof the animals, whose agility has its limits. Where the ground is level\r\ngrass usually grows, and here the cattle spread out in all directions\r\nto feed, and the path naturally dies away. It may be marked on the map\r\nas going on to cross a col and so reach another valley, but as the\r\nnumber of persons making the traverse is likely to be small, the track\r\nis badly marked, as many a tourist has found to his cost.\r\n\r\nFrom such tracks, which are little more than aids in crossing specially\r\ndifficult areas, to the well-made roads which traverse the civilised\r\ncountries of the world the gap is great, for, though the Romans made\r\nmagnificent roads, after their time there was a rapid decay in the art,\r\nand the well-kept roads of the western countries of Europe are things\r\nbut of yesterday.\r\n\r\nWith the development of tracks and roads, as distinct from a mere animal\r\ntrail through the bush, there comes the possibility of using\r\npack-animals and wheeled vehicles for transport. The two do not\r\nnecessarily occur together. Thus in China and Japan wheeled vehicles are\r\ndrawn by human beings, though in China the wheelbarrows drawn by human\r\nporters have also sails to aid their propulsion.\r\n\r\nThe use of animals, whether as pack-animals or for traction, means a\r\nrelatively high degree of civilisation, and means also a food supply\r\nnormally more than enough for the human members of the community. In\r\nmany parts of tropical Africa, despite the tropical luxuriance of many\r\nof the food plants, and the absence of winter, there is practically no\r\nfood reserve, and the normal condition is that the whole group is within\r\nmeasurable reach of starvation, should any one of a whole series of\r\nprobable or possible accidents happen to the plantations. Under such\r\nconditions large domestic animals, requiring great quantities of food,\r\ncannot be kept.\r\n\r\nAgain, where the population is dense, and all the land is required to\r\ngrow food for man, it is not possible to set aside regions for the\r\npasturage of domestic animals, whose numbers must necessarily then be\r\nsmall. This is true of China and Japan, where domestic hoofed animals\r\nare few in number. The contrary condition is of course seen in new\r\ncountries, like Australia and the Argentine, where there are far fewer\r\nmen than sheep and cattle. The United States is beginning to pass from\r\nthis condition, and there have been published already warnings to the\r\ncommunity that it cannot go on giving up much of its fertile land to\r\nthe growth of crops for its domestic animals, instead of for its\r\ncitizens directly.\r\n\r\nOf the domestic animals which have assisted man in the work of transport\r\nthere can be no doubt that the horse is by far the most valuable. It is\r\nthe strongest, the swiftest, and the best fitted for man's purposes. The\r\ncamel, of which so much has been written, is in point of fact a poor\r\nsubstitute for the more valuable animal, rendered necessary by desert\r\nconditions. Among the other animals which have played their part as\r\nbeasts of burden or of traction are many kinds of ox, including the yak\r\nof Tibet; the llama of South America; the elephant; the reindeer; the\r\ndog; and the animals which rank as horses to the zoologist though not to\r\nthe owner--that is the ass and the mule.\r\n\r\nJust as the use of beasts of burden is an enormous improvement upon\r\nhuman porters, and that of wheeled vehicles upon beasts of burden, so is\r\nthe use of steam an enormous improvement upon wheeled vehicles drawn by\r\nanimals. Railways have practically revolutionised the problem of land\r\ntransport, though their cost, especially in countries of marked relief,\r\nis a great drawback to their universal use. The last few years have\r\nseen in the development of motor-driven vehicles a new change, which has\r\ngiven back to the roads their old importance, and which will probably in\r\nthe future greatly aid the development of new countries, and take from\r\nthe railways some of their importance. It is too soon yet to say whether\r\nthe last development of means of transport, the aeroplane, is destined\r\nto affect greatly man's movements and methods of exchanging commodities.\r\n\r\nIn connection with means of communication a few words must be said about\r\ntowns and their position, a subject in which the \"new geography\" has\r\nbeen greatly interested. In this chapter we have assumed that the\r\nprogress of civilisation means, and has always meant, an increasing\r\ndesire on the part of man for freedom of movement, and an increasing\r\nnumber of wants, which have led in their turn to an increasing desire\r\nfor the exchange of commodities. The desire to possess efficient tools\r\nand weapons first attracted him, as we have seen, to the localities\r\nwhere useful minerals occurred. The new powers so obtained increased his\r\ndesires, and also his mobility, and tended to make him cluster round the\r\nspots where his new desires could best be gratified. At a very early\r\nstage the desire to exchange commodities must have led to the founding\r\nof towns, whose number and size have increased with the passage of time.\r\n\r\nOf the various causes which have led to the founding of towns at certain\r\nspots, some are obvious. That which has always attracted most attention\r\nperhaps is the fortress town, placed on some rocky peak, and commanding\r\na well-marked route. But though such towns are imposing, and seem easily\r\nexplained, it is obvious that at no stage of his history has warfare\r\nbeen man's chronic state. Even at the worst period, if there had been no\r\nbusy group of traders at the foot of the fortress-crowned rock, its\r\nsignificance could only have been trifling, and almost all fortress\r\ntowns show, in the proximity of another agglomeration more suited to\r\nnormal human activities, that the fortress itself was always rather\r\nspectacular than significant. Edinburgh, with the old city sloping down\r\nto the plain from the great rock, Carcassonne with the real city some\r\ndistance from the theatrical erection on the hill, are two examples\r\nwhich illustrate this fact.\r\n\r\nOne or two of the chief economic causes of towns may be noted. They\r\ntend to occur where there is a \"break of bulk\" in goods being carried\r\nfrom one region to another. Such break of bulk now takes place at the\r\ngreat ports where the liners unload, but in the old days the small ships\r\ncame up the rivers with the tide, and towns tended to occur at the tidal\r\nlimit, as, _e. g._ at Newcastle-on-Tyne. Towns tend also to occur near\r\nnatural obstacles to easy transport. Thus we have in England a great\r\nnumber of \"bridge towns,\" placed at the point where an important river\r\nwas easily bridged or forded, and thus where co-operative effort was\r\nnecessary to smooth over an obstacle. Towns tend to occur also where two\r\nregions of different natural products meet, for here the inhabitants of\r\nthe two regions meet for the purpose of exchange of goods. Milan, at the\r\nfoot of the Alps and yet in the plain, is a good example, for the\r\nproducts of the plains are not those of the mountains.\r\n\r\nMany cities owe their origin and their fame to some event, often some\r\nreligious association which draws great numbers of pilgrims and others.\r\nIt is often doubtful, however, to what extent the supposed cause is the\r\nreal cause of the city's importance. Not every saint founds a city, not\r\nevery holy city keeps its fame, and in the struggle for existence those\r\ncities will persist whose natural advantages are greatest.\r\n\r\nAnother very important cause of cities is a junction of routes, for this\r\nmeans that many different types of merchandise will pass this way, and\r\nwill give abundant raw material for many minor industries. London is a\r\ngood example of a town upon which many routes converge, these being both\r\nland routes and water routes.\r\n\r\nEven these few examples may serve to suggest the point of view from\r\nwhich the modern geographer regards towns, and to illustrate the fact\r\nthat in this as in other branches of his subject his interest is in the\r\nstudy of causes and of interrelations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the subjects which have been treated in this book fall under the\r\nheading of physical geography, and therefore we may begin these notes by\r\nrecommending two large works of reference on this subject. Salisbury's\r\n_Physiography_ (New York: Henry Holt & Co., 1907, $3.50 net) is the most\r\ncomprehensive work on the subject in English. In French there is an\r\nadmirable book by E. de Martonne, _Traité de Géographie Physique_\r\n(Paris: Armand Colin, 1909, price 22 fr.), to be especially recommended\r\nfor its beautiful plates and diagrams, and for its copious references.\r\n\r\nFor the subjects treated in the individual chapters the following, among\r\nothers, may be consulted. Suess's book translated as _The Face of the\r\nEarth_ (Oxford: Clarendon Press, still in course of publication, price\r\n£4 net) is the classical book on earth structure and relief, and has\r\nstimulated research enormously, but it is not easy to read. For\r\nclimatology the classical book is Hann's _Handbuch_, of which the\r\ngeneral part has been translated by Ward as _Handbook of Climatology_\r\n(New York: The Macmillan Co., 1903, price 12_s._ 6_d._). For plant\r\ngeography reference should be made to Schimper's _Plant Geography_,\r\ntranslated by Fisher (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1903, price 42_s._ net),\r\nwhich is again the classical treatise, and the basis of most of the\r\nlater work. For the races of Europe we have in W. Z. Ripley's _Races of\r\nEurope_ (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co., 1900, price 18_s._\r\nnet) a most interesting book, not difficult and full of most instructive\r\ndiagrams. Another aspect of the same subject is treated in Sergi's _The\r\nMediterranean Race_ (Contemporary Science Series, London: Walter Scott,\r\n1901, price 6_s._), but this is very controversial in tone. For the work\r\nof ice, the most important book is _Die Alpen im Eiszeitalter_ by A.\r\nPenck and G. Brückner (Leipzig: Tauchnitz, 1909, price 55 marks), but\r\nthe line of reasoning followed in it does not convince all geographers,\r\nand the subject is still fiercely debated.\r\n\r\nTurning now to more general aspects of the subject we have in _The\r\nInternational Geography_, edited by H. R. Mill, and written by many\r\nauthors (now published by Macmillan, London--new edition 1907, price\r\n12_s._ net; also published in parts for school use), a most\r\ncomprehensive and authoritative work, which includes the whole globe in\r\nits survey, and has also general chapters on various aspects of\r\ngeography. It is, however, a difficult book, intended for study rather\r\nthan for general reading, and is very much condensed. A book which,\r\nthough dealing only with a very limited region, yet contrives in\r\ndiscussing that area to give the essentials of modern geographical\r\nscience, is Mackinder's _Britain and the British Seas_ (second edition.\r\n1907. Oxford: Clarendon Press, price 7_s._ 6_d._).\r\n\r\nIt should be in all geographical libraries.\r\n\r\nAs commercial geography is one of the sides from which geography appeals\r\nmost strongly to the general reader, we may note that the classic is G.\r\nG. Chisholm's _Handbook of Commercial Geography_ (New York: Longmans,\r\nGreen & Co., price $4.80 net). First published in 1889 it is brought up\r\nto date in successive editions, and is full of interest for the general\r\npublic as well as for the geographer. In the same connection we may note\r\nJ. G. Bartholomew's admirable _Atlas of the World's Commerce_ (London:\r\nGeorge Newnes, 1907, price 10_s._ 6_d._), which is of great assistance\r\nin studying the subject owing to its very clear maps and diagrams. A\r\nsmaller and cheaper work by the same author is _A School Economic Atlas_\r\n(Oxford: University Press, 1910, price 2_s._ 6_d._ net).\r\n\r\nThere are an enormous number of small books on geographical subjects,\r\nfor these as well as for others reference may be made to a useful little\r\nvolume called _Guide to Geographical Books and Appliances_, which is\r\ncompiled by members of the Geographical Association (London: Geo.\r\nPhilip, 1910, price 5_s._). This is especially intended for teachers,\r\nbut gives full descriptions, with critical notes, of a great number of\r\nbooks. To the list given there we may add one book which, though\r\nintended for school use, may be noted as containing a great deal of\r\ninformation of the kind which is just beginning to find its way into the\r\nsmaller text-books. This is Unstead and Taylor's _General and Regional\r\nGeography for Students_ (London: Geo. Philip, 1910, price 6_s._). An\r\nexcellent practical book is Simmons and Richardson's _Introduction to\r\nPractical Geography_ (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1907, price 90 cts.).\r\n\r\nFinally, we may note that the _Geographical Journal_, published monthly\r\nby the Royal Geographical Society in London, and the _Scottish\r\nGeographical Magazine_, published monthly by the Royal Scottish\r\nGeographical Society in Edinburgh, both give reviews and accounts of all\r\nimportant geographical books, as they appear, with abstracts of\r\nimportant articles and papers, as well as publishing original papers.\r\nBoth are obtainable at most libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aar valley, 57, 67\r\n\r\n  Aberdeen, 44\r\n\r\n  Abyssal fauna, 145\r\n\r\n  Abysses of ocean, 28\r\n\r\n  Acacia, 79\r\n\r\n  Africa, climate of, 91, 100;\r\n    exploration of, 13;\r\n    fauna of, 23, 152;\r\n    forests of, 120;\r\n    position of, 22;\r\n    slave trade in, 236\r\n\r\n  Agave, 85, 125\r\n\r\n  Ague, 162\r\n\r\n  Ailanthus, 78\r\n\r\n  Aire gap, 47 (fig. 5), 49, 73\r\n\r\n  Alabama, 35\r\n\r\n  Alaska, forests of, 136;\r\n    minerals of, 220\r\n\r\n  Algiers, means of communication in, 240;\r\n    rainfall of, 95;\r\n    vegetation of, 92\r\n\r\n  Allium, 124\r\n\r\n  Almonds, 176\r\n\r\n  Alnwick, 232\r\n\r\n  Aloe, 125\r\n\r\n  _Alp_, 59, 60, 190\r\n\r\n  Alpine plants, 122\r\n\r\n  Alpine race, 190, 192, 199, 206-216\r\n\r\n  Alps, 32, 33, 57, 58, 59, 68, 70, 80, 122, 192, 241\r\n\r\n  Amazon, 43, 45\r\n\r\n  America, exploration of, 14\r\n\r\n  America, North, climate of, 101-102;\r\n    fauna of, 23, 152;\r\n    flora of, 135-142;\r\n    glaciation of, 52, 53, 77;\r\n    mammals of, 166;\r\n    position of, 17;\r\n    primitive means of communication in, 239-241;\r\n    trees of, 78, 79;\r\n    vegetation of, 122\r\n\r\n  America, South, fauna of, 23\r\n\r\n  Anchovies, 149\r\n\r\n  Andes, 48\r\n\r\n  Anemone, 124\r\n\r\n  Annuals, 124, 126, 128, 134\r\n\r\n  Anopheles, 162\r\n\r\n  Antarctic, exploration of, 14\r\n\r\n  Anticyclones, 107-110 (fig. 12)\r\n\r\n  Anti-trade winds, 88, 89, 90\r\n\r\n  Apes, 155\r\n\r\n  Appleby, 232\r\n\r\n  Apples, 176, 184\r\n\r\n  Apricots, 176\r\n\r\n  Aquatic animals, 144 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  Arabs, 178, 180\r\n\r\n  Aragon, 200\r\n\r\n  Arbroath, 235\r\n\r\n  Arbutus, 130, 192\r\n\r\n  Arctic, exploration of, 14\r\n\r\n  Arctogæic realm, 152\r\n\r\n  Ardennes, 33\r\n\r\n  Area of low pressure in N.
