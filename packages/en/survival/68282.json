different methods, both Chinese and\r\nforeign, of butchering and curing meats. The aim has been to present\r\nthe material in a practical way so as to be of value to the general\r\npublic as well as of special service in connection with the courses in\r\nMeats offered at the Canton Christian College.\r\n\r\nThe writer realizes that this bulletin is not complete, in that the\r\nsubject, especially in regard to curing meats in different parts of\r\nChina, is far from exhausted. However, it is thought best to publish\r\nin this form, and in a later edition to include additional material\r\nwhich may be secured on the subject. Constructive criticism on this\r\nbulletin will be received gladly.\r\n\r\nThe writer is especially indebted to the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture for permission to use material from its publications.\r\nSpecial acknowledgment is also due to Mr. Taam Sik Hung and Mr. W. L.\r\nFunkhouser of the agricultural staff of the Canton Christian College,\r\nwho have made valuable suggestions in the preparation of the\r\nmanuscript, to agricultural students who have taken the course in\r\nMeats under the writer’s supervision and have assisted in securing the\r\ndata on Chinese methods of curing meats, and to Mr. A. H. Holt,\r\nInstructor of English in Canton Christian College, for his assistance\r\nin reading the manuscript.\r\n\r\n                                                 C. O. Levine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Butchering and Curing Meats in China\r\n\r\n                             Introduction\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, like most people, are lovers of pork, beef, mutton, and\r\npoultry, and consume these meats, both fresh and cured, in large\r\nquantities each year.\r\n\r\nFresh meat is practically all consumed within a few miles of the\r\nlocality in which it is butchered. However large quantities of cured\r\nmeats, especially cured pork and duck, are shipped long distances from\r\nthe localities where they are cured. Cured hams and bacon are shipped\r\nfrom Kuling north to Peking, and south to Canton. Yunnan exports to\r\nCanton and other parts of China, to the Philippine Islands and other\r\ncountries to the south, a considerable quantity of home cured ham,\r\nwhich is quite popular with the Chinese in those regions. On the other\r\nhand, a good deal of cured ham and bacon is imported, chiefly from\r\nAustralia and England, to the various ports of China and finds its way\r\ninland.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years Canton Christian College has been studying the\r\nbutchering and curing problems as they exist in southern China,\r\nparticularly in the region of Canton. Meats of various kinds have\r\nbeen butchered and cured by the College. Both the foreign and\r\nChinese methods of handling the meat have been practiced and\r\nstudied. In this work special attention has been given to the\r\nbutchering and curing of pork.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Canton is one not especially well adapted to\r\ncuring meat. This is due to the fact that the temperature never falls\r\nbelow 32 degrees Fahrenheit, even in the coldest winter season.\r\nFurther, this low a temperature is not maintained more than a few\r\ndays of the winter season, and only at night. Before noon it usually\r\nrises to 50 or 60, following even the coldest nights. In spite of the\r\nfact that the temperature never gets very low, the work at the College\r\nhas demonstrated that it is possible to produce good cured meat, if\r\ndone properly, even without the use of ice. However there is some\r\nrisk of the meat spoiling without ice, and it is recommended,\r\nespecially in curing large pieces of meat, such as hams and shoulders,\r\nthat ice be used to facilitate the cooling of the meat before the cure\r\nis applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Origin of Meat Foods\r\n\r\n\r\nMan uses for his meat diet almost all classes of animal life. However,\r\nthe principal classes of animals that supply the human race with meat\r\nfood are: cattle, hogs, sheep, poultry, and, in China and southern\r\nEurope, the buffalo. In Northern China the camel and in Western China\r\nthe yak are also used to some extent for food. Such animals as birds\r\n(other than poultry), rabbits, fish and other forms of water life,\r\nwhile of importance, do not provide as large a supply of meat food as\r\ndo the domesticated animals mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Food Animals in China\r\n\r\n\r\nThe animals in China from which the main supply of meat comes are\r\nswine, cattle, water buffalo, and poultry (including chickens, ducks,\r\nand geese).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. Hogs\r\n\r\nHogs in China are of both the bacon and lard types. The lard type is\r\nthe most common, except in the provinces of Yunnan, Szechwan, and some\r\nregions in central China, where the bacon type is found.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese lard hogs are characterized by their large, pendulous\r\nbellies, sway-backs, light hams, and by their slowness in maturing.\r\nThey are inferior hogs when compared with the improved breeds of\r\nEurope and America, but as a rule are better than the native hogs\r\nfound in other parts of the Orient. Their large bellies and low backs\r\nare largely due to the fact that from the time the pigs begin to eat\r\nuntil they are butchered, all concentrate feeds are given in the form\r\nof a very wet swill, and they are allowed to drink all they can hold\r\nof such feed twice a day. Such feeding stretches the digestive tract\r\nto an abnormal degree, and permanently enlarges the belly and pulls\r\ndown the back. By giving less water with the feed, and not allowing\r\nthe pigs to fill up with all they can possibly hold, this abnormal\r\ndevelopment can largely be prevented. Intelligent breeding for several\r\ngenerations, by mating animals with the most desirable conformation,\r\nsuch as straight backs, wide, deep hams, long, deep bodies, short\r\nheads, and short legs, should bring about further improvement.\r\nBreeding for fast growing and early maturing animals should also be\r\npracticed, as the most profitable feeding is with young animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Heifer two years old of the native humped\r\nvariety]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Beef-draft water buffalos with calves a few\r\nweeks old]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Chinese “fat-tailed” variety of sheep]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Chinese lard hogs ready for butchering raised\r\nat Canton Christian College]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that years ago the native lard hog of\r\nsouthern China was used to secure desirable characters in two of our\r\nmost important modern breeds, the Berkshire and the Poland China\r\nbreeds. However, since that time these western breeds have been\r\nfurther greatly improved by intelligent selection and breeding, while\r\nthe Chinese hogs have been very little improved, if at all. To-day, in\r\ncomparing the native Chinese lard hog with the modern western breeds,\r\nthere is no resemblance in the Chinese hog to the wide, slightly\r\narched back, deep, long sides, deep, full hams, small heads, short\r\nlegs, and rapid growth of these modern breeds which have, in their\r\norigin, blood of the native Chinese lard hog.\r\n\r\nDue to slow maturity and undesirable conformation, the Chinese hog is\r\nnot as economical in converting feeds into meat as is the improved\r\nwestern hog. However, the meat is of good flavor and can be\r\nsuccessfully cured. An exception to this is the case of animals that\r\nhave been largely fed on rice bran, which produces a soft, oily pork,\r\nalthough no difficulty is experienced in curing such pork. Wheat bran\r\nproduces a firm flesh. If a firm flesh is desired, it is important\r\nthat rice bran or polish not be fed to hogs during the last six to\r\neight weeks of the fattening period.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. Cattle\r\n\r\nThe main source of beef in China is the native “humped” cow, called by\r\nthe people of southern China _Wong Ngau_ which means “yellow cow”.\r\nThis native variety of humped cattle is a good beef animal, although\r\nthere is room for a great deal of improvement by breeding for early\r\nmaturity, greater size, and development of a more distinctly beef type.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. Water Buffalo Beef\r\n\r\nThe water buffalo, while chiefly used for draft purposes, is an\r\nimportant source of beef in China. There is very little difference in\r\nquality between the Chinese buffalo beef and ordinary beef. However,\r\nthe lean meat of the buffalo is considerably darker in color than the\r\nlean meat in ordinary beef.\r\n\r\nYoung stock, up to three years old, that have not been used for draft\r\npurposes, are best for beef. Beef from buffalos or cattle that have\r\nbeen used for work for some time before butchering is generally tough,\r\nand less palatable than beef from animals that have not been worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. Sheep and Goats\r\n\r\nIn northern China, especially in the provinces of Shantung and Chihli,\r\nthe fat-tailed variety of sheep is raised to a considerable extent,\r\nboth for mutton and for wool. The covering of wool is light, however,\r\nwhen compared with that of the wool breeds, and this sheep is properly\r\nclassed as a mutton sheep. They are so called because of their large\r\nfat tails, which are about three to four inches thick, six to eight\r\ninches wide, and eight to ten inches long. Fat-tailed sheep are\r\nshipped by rail and by boat to many parts of China from the regions in\r\nwhich they are raised.\r\n\r\nThe goat, while of less importance than the sheep as a source of meat,\r\nis raised in limited numbers in many parts of China for meat purposes.\r\nMeat from the goat is considered inferior to that from sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. Poultry\r\n\r\nThe most common of all animal food in China is probably poultry. Many\r\nvarieties of chickens, ducks, and geese are raised. Some of the best\r\nbreeds of chickens for meat are the Langshang, from the Shanghai\r\nregion, of which there are two varieties, the black and the white; and\r\nthe Swatow, of which there are also two varieties, the white and buff.\r\nThese breeds are large and meaty, individuals weighing from five to\r\neight pounds. There is a number of other distinct breeds and varieties\r\nof chickens, which, while they are not as good for meat as the above,\r\ndue to their smaller size, are used extensively for food.\r\n\r\nIn the region of Canton, the common variety of chickens used for\r\nmeat, and also for egg production, is a small buff-colored variety,\r\ngenerally more or less mixed with other varieties. This variety,\r\nwhich is called _wong kai_ (黃雞) by the Cantonese, is becoming very\r\npopular in the Philippine Islands, where it is called the\r\n“Cantonese” chicken because of its introduction from Canton.\r\n\r\nThe most common ducks of southern China are of a dark colored variety.\r\nIn north China the white Peking duck is the common variety. Both are\r\nexcellent for meat.\r\n\r\nThere are three varieties of Chinese geese; the grey, white,\r\nand brown. The grey variety is probably more generally used for\r\nmeat than are the other two varieties. It is the only variety raised\r\non a large scale in southern China, and its meat is of excellent\r\nquality. Chinese geese are distinguished from other breeds of geese\r\nby the fleshy protuberance at the base of the bill and front of the\r\nskull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Selection of Animals for Slaughter\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. Health\r\n\r\nIn the selection of animals for slaughter health should be given first\r\nconsideration. Even though the animal has been fairly fed and carries\r\na prime finish, the best quality of meat cannot be obtained if the\r\nanimal is unhealthy. If the animal has fever or serious derangement of\r\nany kind, the meat will not be wholesome. There is little direct\r\nevidence of harmful results from the use of animals in the first\r\nstages of such diseases as tuberculosis, cholera, plague, rinderpest,\r\nand such diseases, but the only safe course is to discourage the use\r\nof any animal for food that is known to be in imperfect health. The\r\nkeeping qualities of meat are always impaired by fever or other\r\nderangements of the system. Bruises, broken limbs, and like accidents\r\nall have the same effect on the meat as ill health, and unless the\r\nanimal can be dressed immediately after such accidents, it is best not\r\nto use the meat for food. This is especially true if the rise in\r\ntemperature, which usually results from such accidents, has been 2\r\ndegrees F. or more. A rise in temperature just before slaughtering\r\nusually results in a stringy, bluish meat, which is difficult to cure.\r\nAnimals should not be butchered while in heat, as the meat of such\r\nanimals will be strong, and cannot be cured, as it sours quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. Condition\r\n\r\nFirst class meat cannot be obtained from animals in poor flesh.\r\nThe proper amount of fat must be present to give juiciness and\r\nflavor to the meat. It is more important, however, that the animal\r\nshould be in good physical condition than that it should be very\r\nfat. “Never kill an animal when it is losing flesh” is a maxim\r\nfollowed by butchers. There is a good deal of truth in the saying.\r\nWhen the animal is losing in flesh, the muscle fibers are shrinking\r\nin volume and contain correspondingly less water. As a result, the\r\nmeat is tougher and drier. When an animal is gaining in flesh, the\r\nopposite condition prevails, and a better quality of meat results.\r\nAlso, a better quality of meat will be obtained from an animal in\r\nmedium flesh, but gaining in weight, than from a very fat animal\r\nthat is neither gaining nor losing in flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. Breeding\r\n\r\nBecause of careless selection of breeding stock, most of the hogs in\r\nthe region of Canton have low backs, large bellies, scant hams, never\r\nproduce the best quality of meat, and have a low dressing percentage.\r\nThe improved hog with a level or slightly arched wide back, long,\r\ndeep, smooth sides, full hams, and short neck and head, has meat of\r\nthe best quality, and such hogs have the highest dressing percentage.\r\nFine bone, soft hair, and mellow flesh, qualities generally found in\r\nwell bred animals, are desired in all animals used for meat, as they\r\nindicate meat of a good quality, with a minimum of waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. Feeding\r\n\r\nThe kind of food the hog gets during the last six or eight weeks of\r\nthe fattening period largely determines the flavor and the character\r\nof the meat. During that period, it is best not to feed very much of\r\nrice bran, or peanut cake, as when such feeds are given they produce\r\nvery soft, oily fat. Wheat bran and corn produce a firm fat, and one\r\nor the other, or both together, should constitute a large part of the\r\ngrain ration for the fattening hog.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. Age and Size for Killing\r\n\r\nIt is a well known fact that meat from an old animal is very likely to\r\nbe tough and difficult to cook sufficiently to make it tender. On the\r\nother hand, meat from very young animals is watery and often lacks\r\nflavor. An old animal in good condition is to be preferred to a young\r\none in poor condition. Hogs can be killed for meat any time after six\r\nweeks, but the most profitable age at which to slaughter is from eight\r\nto ten months. Hogs at that age have a higher dressing percentage than\r\nwhen younger. Gain in weight is made at a lower cost in young animals\r\nthan in older animals. For this reason, it is not advisable to keep a\r\nhog much longer than twelve months, or a beef animal more than two\r\nyears, unless feed is very cheap.\r\n\r\nIf the pork is to be cured, the hogs for butchering should weigh from\r\none hundred and thirty to two hundred pounds. Larger hogs can be\r\nbutchered conveniently, although a hog much heavier will be more\r\ndifficult to handle.\r\n\r\nIn southern China, where the day temperature is seldom below sixty\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit during the butchering season, a difficulty in\r\ncooling the meat will be experienced, unless ice is used, and if the\r\nmeat is not properly cooled it will not cure well.\r\n\r\nChickens have the most tender meat at the age of three to six months,\r\ndepending on the variety, and at that age sell for the highest price.\r\nPoultry that have just reached maturity are best for curing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Preparation of the Animals for Slaughter\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is important that the animal to be slaughtered should not be given\r\nfood from twenty to thirty hours before slaughtering. If kept on full\r\nfeed until just before it is killed the circulatory system is gorged,\r\nand the blood, loaded with assimilated nutrients is driven to the\r\nextremities of the capillaries. In such condition, it is impossible to\r\ndrain the veins thoroughly, and a reddish colored, unattractive\r\ncarcass will result. Food in the digestive tract decomposes very\r\nrapidly after the animal is killed, and when the dressing is slow the\r\ngases from such decomposing food are apt to flavor the meat.\r\n\r\nWater should be given freely up to the time of slaughter, as it helps\r\nto keep the temperature normal and helps to wash the waste matter from\r\nthe system, resulting in a nicely colored carcass.\r\n\r\nThe care of the animals before slaughter has considerable effect on\r\nthe meat. They should not be excited in any way sufficiently to raise\r\nthe body temperature. Excitement will prevent proper draining of the\r\nblood vessels, and, if extreme, will cause souring of the meat on\r\ncuring. An animal should never be killed immediately after it has been\r\nheated by a hard run. It is better to let such an animal rest until\r\nthe next day rather than to run the risk of the meat spoiling, as the\r\nmeat of an animal that has been overheated will not keep well. Such\r\nmeat is usually of pale color and very often will become sour or\r\nputrid within three or four days after it has been dressed, even\r\nthough kept near the freezing point while it is being cured.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken not to bruise the animals in handling them just\r\nbefore killing. Bruises cause the blood to settle in the part of the\r\ncarcass affected, presenting an uninviting appearance, besides\r\naffecting the curing qualities of the meat.\r\n\r\nBefore killing, a twenty-five hour fast, plenty of clean water,\r\ncareful handling and rest, are all important items in securing the\r\nbest quality of meat, either for cooking fresh or for curing purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Bleeding and Dressing Hogs\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. Tools\r\n\r\nThe essential tools for doing good work at killing time are: A good\r\nsticking knife, a cleaver, a 14-inch steel on which to sharpen the\r\nknives, hog hooks, bell-shaped scrapers, meat saw, and gambrel. More\r\nthan one of each tool is necessary if many hogs are to be butchered\r\nand handled efficiently. A block and tackle will reduce labor in\r\nhanging the hog for gutting.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 12. Scalding Equipment\r\n\r\nIn China, the water for scalding is heated in a sort of a furnace\r\ncommonly called _t’ong chue ts’o_. (劏豬灶). The furnace is made of\r\nbrick and concrete, or concrete only. It is usually about thirty-six\r\ninches wide, six feet long, and twenty-eight inches high at one end,\r\ngradually sloping to about twenty-six inches high near the other end,\r\nwhere a large brass or iron basin for holding water is placed over a\r\nfire grate. The basin in which the water is heated is usually about\r\ntwenty inches in diameter, eight inches deep in the center, and\r\ndiminishing in depth from the center to the rim. The shallow basin\r\nwith large contact with the fire obtains quick heating and saving of\r\nfuel. The top of the furnace is made to slope from all sides toward\r\nthe bowl so that, when hot water is poured on the hog which lies on\r\nthe table, the water runs back into the basin.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 13. Killing the Hog\r\n\r\nAll tools and apparatus used in killing and handling the animal should\r\nbe ready before it is killed. The knives and saws should be sharp and\r\nclean. The water should be near the boiling point and the block and\r\ntackle ready, if one is to be used.\r\n\r\nThe common and most satisfactory method of killing the hog is by\r\nsevering the large arteries and veins in the neck of the animal with a\r\nsticking knife about nine inches long. The animal should be laid on\r\nits back and held firmly while it is being stuck. Two men can handle\r\na large hog if they work intelligently. By reaching under the animal and\r\ngrasping the opposite legs and suddenly jerking the legs, a heavy hog\r\ncan be easily turned over on its back. One man standing astride the\r\nanimal with his feet close against its sides, and holding the front\r\nlegs, can easily control it while the other does the sticking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.

Hog scraped and hung up for gutting]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Scraping the hog on the “_t’ong chue t’so_”]\r\n\r\nIt is a common custom with Chinese butchers to lay the hog across a\r\nnarrow bench for sticking. This requires more handling of the animal\r\nthen when the animal is simply turned over on its back on the floor,\r\nor on a low table or box for the sticking.\r\n\r\nThe sticking knife should have a blade eight or nine inches long. In\r\nAmerica, a knife with straight edges, which at the end tapers to a\r\npoint is used, while in China, a knife tapering from two inches wide\r\nat the handle to a long, narrow point is used. Either type of knife\r\nwill do. The knife should be thrust diagonally into the neck for about\r\nsix to eight inches of its length, depending on the size of the hog.\r\nIt should be inserted on the middle line of the body, about three or\r\nfour inches in front of the sternum, with the sharp edge of the knife\r\ntoward the rear and the knife pointed in the direction of the loin of\r\nthe hog. One hand of the operator should be held on the lower jaw of\r\nthe hog to help hold the animal steady. It will require a little\r\npractice to stick properly. If rightly done, the large blood vessels\r\nwill be severed, the animal will bleed quickly, and be dead in less\r\nthan five minutes.\r\n\r\nIn large packing houses, where each man has a certain piece of work to\r\ndo, the hogs are hung by one leg upon a moving over-head track. As the\r\nhogs move by the killer, he grasps one front leg with one hand, and,\r\nwith the other hand, does the sticking. Such an arrangement is\r\npractical where a large number of hogs is killed daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 14. “Watered” Meat\r\n\r\nThere is a very common practice in China of increasing the weight of\r\nthe dressed hog carcass by forcing water into the meat as soon as the\r\nblood has drained away and the scraping is finished. Water is forced\r\nin through the large blood vessels leading away from the heart. To do\r\nthis properly, care is taken in sticking not to sever the large blood\r\nvessels from the heart. This is accomplished by using a long, narrow\r\nsticking knife, which is thrust into the heart itself. The animal thus\r\nstuck bleeds into the chest cavity, which is not desirable, as the\r\nbleeding will not be as thorough as when the large blood vessels only\r\nare severed. The carcass of the hog may be increased several pounds by\r\nthis treatment. It is difficult to detect from the appearance of the\r\npork whether or not it has been watered. On roasting, watered meat\r\nshrinks more than normal meat. Watered meat will spoil quicker than\r\nnormal meat, and will not cure well. The practice of “watering” meat\r\nshould be discouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 15. Scalding and Scraping\r\n\r\nAn soon as the hog is dead, it must be scalded and the hair and scurf\r\nquickly removed. The animal is then placed on the top of the _t’ong\r\nchue ts’o_. The head and shoulders are scalded first. They should be\r\nimmersed in the water, which should be from 185 to 190 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. If the water is hotter, the hair will set. Care should be\r\ntaken to keep the carcass constantly moving by turning it from side to\r\nside, in other to get a uniform scald and not to allow the carcass to\r\nstay in contact with the bottom of the bowl in which the water is\r\nbeing heated. Occasionally it should be removed from the water and the\r\nhair “tried”. As soon as the hair and scurf slip easily, the scalding\r\nis complete. The hind quarters are scalded in the same manner. The\r\nhead and feet should be scraped first, as the hair sets on those parts\r\nfirst. Two or three pounds of wood ashes put in the water will help\r\nloosen the scurf. Proper scalding and scraping require fast work. If\r\nthe carcass gets cold before the hair has been removed, the hair will\r\nset and have to be removed by shaving with a sharp knife. For\r\nscraping, the candle-stick or bell-shaped scraper is best. What cannot\r\nbe removed with it, can be removed with a sharp, curved knife.\r\n\r\nIn America when only from one to three hogs are butchered\r\nat a time the custom is to heat the water in a large kettle over a stove\r\nor out-door fire. The hot water is poured into a barrel which is\r\ntipped at an angle with the top of the table, the top of the table being\r\nlevel with the lower side of the top of the barrel. The hog is\r\nslid into the barrel, first the head end, and then the rear end. The\r\nbody is kept in motion by pulling it up and down until it is scalded,\r\nand the hair and scurf slip well. This is a quick method of scalding\r\nas much of the hog can be immersed in the water at one time,\r\nbut it requires more labor than does the method of scalding with the\r\n_t’ong chue ts’o_.\r\n\r\nIn large packing houses, the hogs are automatically scalded and\r\nscraped, by being drawn through a tube filled with water of the proper\r\ntemperature. Stiff brushes on the inside of the tube remove the hair\r\nand scurf as the hog passes through.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 16. Gutting\r\n\r\nThe entrails of the hog may be removed with the hog lying on a table,\r\nas is the common practice in the Canton region. The hog should be\r\npropped so that it lies on its back. However, it is more conveniently\r\ndone with the hog hung up by its hind legs. To hang up the hog\r\nrequires what is known as a gambrel, which may be simply a strong\r\nstick, pointed at the ends, about an inch and a half in diameter and\r\neighteen inches long, a block and tackle, and a secure place\r\nover-head, about nine feet high, for attaching one end of the tackle.\r\nWith a sharp knife, the cords in the hind legs just above the\r\ndew claws are separated from the bone enough to allow inserting the\r\nsharpened end of the gambrel, and thus spreading the legs. The gambrel\r\nshould have a hook or ring in the center for attaching it to one end\r\nof a block and tackle. The carcass is then lifted so that the head end\r\nclears the floor or ground about four inches. A better and more\r\nconvenient gambrel may be made of iron and adjustable for hogs of\r\ndifferent sizes.\r\n\r\nAfter the hog is hung up, clean water should be poured on it and it\r\nshould then be scraped clean of all remaining patches of hair, scurf,\r\nor dirt. The head should then be removed by cutting through the flesh\r\nto the atlas joint where the neck joins the head, cutting entirely\r\naround the neck about an inch back of the ears. If the head does not\r\ndrop off, it can be easily removed by grasping it by the ears and\r\ntwisting it.\r\n\r\nIf removing the entrails, first cut through the flesh between the hind\r\nlegs, to the bone, and split the pelvic bones with a saw or cleaver.\r\nCutting through the bone is easily done if the cut through the flesh\r\nis made on the midline between the hind legs, as the bone is very thin\r\nat that point. Cut through the flesh down the midline of the belly\r\ntoward the head, to the breastbone. In doing this, care should be\r\ntaken not to cut the intestines, which lie just beneath the thick\r\nlayer of fat meat. By shielding the point of the knife with the left\r\nhand and guiding it with the right, there is little danger of cutting\r\nthe intestines. The entrails are now exposed, and the fat from around\r\nthe stomach should be removed. This fat is strong in flavor and should\r\nnot be mixed with the leaf fat. Cut around the anus close to the tail\r\nand strip the rectum from its attachment to the back bone. A string\r\nshould be tightly tied around the end of the rectum and the urethra so\r\nthat there will be no danger of the contents of the intestines or\r\nbladder soiling the meat. If the animal is a male, care should be\r\ntaken not to cut the penis in making the cut down the midline of the\r\nbody and between the hind legs. The penis should be stripped from the\r\nfat in which it is embedded, and thrown over the back of the animal\r\nout of the way of the butcher. Then remove the stomach and intestines\r\nby cutting across the gullet, after first pulling the gullet up into\r\nthe chest cavity. Remove the liver from its attachment to the\r\nintestines and remove the gall bladder from its attachment to the\r\nliver. Care should be taken not to cut the gall bladder. Now cut\r\nthrough the breast bone, beginning at the front end and cutting upward\r\nwith a knife through the flesh to the bone. The bone is best cut with\r\na saw, and the cut should be made upward. The “pluck”, which consists\r\nof the heart, lungs, and gullet, is removed by cutting across the\r\nartery which can be easily seen running down the backbone, and by\r\ncutting around the diaphragm close to the ribs. Split the backbone\r\nwith a saw to facilitate cooling. In cutting, a knife should always be\r\nused for cutting through the flesh before the saw is used. If the saw\r\nis used for cutting the meat, the cut surface of the meat will have a\r\nrough, unattractive appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 17. Cooling the Carcass\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the butchers in Canton cut up the carcass immediately after\r\ngutting. This may be necessary in a warm climate where no ice is used\r\nto facilitate cooling, in order to prevent the meat from souring, but\r\nthe meat handles much better if it is cooled before it is cut up. This\r\nmay be done during the cold weather of the winter season by butchering\r\nin the evening and allowing the carcass to cool over night, or by\r\nplacing the meat in a refrigerator, at a temperature of from 34 to 40\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit. Freshly killed meat absorbs odors very readily and\r\nthere should be no fresh paint, tar, kerosene, or like substances near\r\nthe fresh meat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. A good lard hog. Note the full back and hams,\r\nshort neck, deep sides, short legs, and excellent quality]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Dressed carcass: 1, hams; 2, bacon; 3, fatback;\r\n4, shoulder; 5, jowl; 6, shoulder butt; 7, leaf lard; 8, ribs;\r\n9, fat back and chops; 10, head.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 18. Cutting up the Carcass\r\n\r\nAfter the two halves of the carcass have been cooled, they may be\r\nplaced on a table with the meat side up. The front legs are removed\r\nabout an inch above the knee and the hind legs about an inch above the\r\nhock. Immediately remove the leaf lard and the kidneys, all in one\r\npiece, so as to facilitate cooling, using the hands to strip the leaf\r\nlard from its attachment to the sides. Strip out the tenderloin.\r\nDivide each half of the carcass into three parts, the shoulders,\r\nmiddle and hams. For cutting through the flesh, a heavy knife with a\r\ncurved blade is best. A saw should be used in cutting through the\r\nbone. Cutting should be across the grain of the meat as much as is\r\npossible, in order that the meat will carve better after cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 19. Shoulders\r\n\r\nThe shoulder cut is made between the fourth and fifth ribs, where the\r\nribs leave the backbone. The cut should be made at right angles with\r\nthe top and bottom edges of the middle piece in order to make a\r\nrectangular middle piece. This necessitates a diagonal cut across the\r\nend of the fourth rib. If the shoulders are to be cured, remove the\r\nribs and the backbone from the shoulder piece. Cut close to the ribs\r\nin removing them in order to leave as much meat on the shoulder as is\r\npossible. Cut off the top of the shoulder with about one and one-half\r\ninches of the cartilage and bone at the top. This removes most of the\r\nfat meat and trims the shoulder for curing. The shoulder should be\r\nfurther trimmed by cutting off rough parts with a sharp knife.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 20. Middle Part\r\n\r\nSeparate the hams from the middle by cutting just back of the\r\nbeginning of the rise in the backbone. The ribs should be separated\r\nfrom the side meat. If it is desired to make pork chops, care should\r\nbe taken to leave the long muscle on either side of the backbone\r\nattached to the backbone and ribs. The end of the ribs should then be\r\ncut off with a cleaver, leaving about three inches of the ribs\r\nattached to the backbone to form part of the chops. In preparing the\r\nchops for roasting, cuts should be made through the meat between the\r\nribs and between the vertebrae.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom for butchers in Canton to remove all the meat from\r\nthe ribs and backbone. The sides are then cut into strips about one\r\ninch wide, cutting from the top to the bottom, and used, fresh or\r\ncured. The ribs and backbone are then cut into small parts and\r\nprepared in a very tasty way with a sweet dressing. The dish prepared\r\nin this manner is known as _chue p’aai kwat_ (豬排骨).\r\n\r\nIf the side meat is to be made into cured bacon, the first method of\r\nseparating the ribs from the meat is followed. This leaves the side\r\nmeat about one and a half to two inches thick. The strip of pure fat\r\nmeat along the top, known as the fat back, the strip of belly fat at\r\nthe bottom, up to, and including the teats, should be removed. The\r\nmiddle piece which is left after thus trimming, is used for making\r\ncured bacon. The fat back and the belly strip can be used for lard.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 21. Hams\r\n\r\nIf the hams are to be cured, all sharp points should be smoothed off,\r\ngiving a neat, rounded shape to the ham.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 22. Trimmings\r\n\r\nThe small pieces of meat cut from the shoulders, hams, and middle\r\npieces in trimming, maybe used fresh, or made into sausage. The fat of\r\nthe trimmings may be used for making lard.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23. Head\r\n\r\nThe fattest part of the head may be used for lard, or cut into strips\r\nabout three quarters of an inch wide and cured, or it may be used for\r\nmaking sausage or head cheese. The snout, ears, and tongue may be used\r\nfresh or pickled.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 24. Feet\r\n\r\nThe small amount of meat on the feet is considered very delicious. The\r\nfeet may be either cooked for immediate use, or they may be pickled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Killing and Dressing Beef\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 25. Tools\r\n\r\nThe following tools are necessary for killing and dressing cattle: an\r\nax, an 8-inch sticking knife, a skinning knife, a steel for sharpening\r\nthe knives, a 28-inch meat saw, gambrel, and a block and tackle for\r\nhoisting up the carcass.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 26. Stunning\r\n\r\nThe first step in killing and dressing beef is to secure the animal so\r\nthat it cannot possibly break loose. A strong halter, or new half-inch\r\nrope, tied around the neck and with one end tied to a ring in the\r\nfloor, or to a tree, works very well. If the animal has a ring or a\r\nbar through the nose, as most cattle have in China, it should be\r\nfurther secured by tying with a strong rope attached to the ring or\r\nbar. The animal should be tied very short so that it cannot move its\r\nhead to any extent.\r\n\r\nStunning is done in two ways. One method is to strike a heavy blow\r\nwith a stunning ax, weighing about three pounds, made especially for\r\nthe purpose, with an extension head about an inch in diameter which\r\nreadily crashes through the bone covering the brain, and into the\r\nbrain itself. The blow should be struck in the center of the forehead.\r\nAn ordinary ax with a long handle, can be used, although the kind\r\ndescribed above is best, in that it is sure to stun the animal, and\r\nthus is most humane. The other method which is commonly used in\r\nsouthern China, is to strike just back of the poll, and dislocate the\r\natlas joint. This is just as effective as a blew on the forehead, if\r\nthe blow is struck with enough force. Water buffalos have a very hard\r\nskull and for this reason are sometimes shot. The end of the gun\r\nshould be held close to the head and carefully aimed at a point in the\r\ncenter of the forehead, where lines would cross if drawn from the base\r\nof the right horn to the left eye, and from the base of the left horn\r\nto the right eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 27. Bleeding\r\n\r\nThe animal should be bled immediately after stunning or shooting. To\r\ndo this properly requires practice. With the stunned animal lying\r\nstretched out on the floor, stand at its throat with the back toward\r\nits body. Place one foot against the jaw, and with the other hold back\r\nthe front legs of the animal. Reaching down between the feet, lay open\r\nthe skin from the breast toward the chin for a distance of about ten\r\ninches, using the ordinary skinning knife. Insert the knife with the\r\nback against the breastbone and the tip directed toward the spinal\r\ncolumn at the top of the shoulders, cutting just under the windpipe,\r\nand about five or six inches deep. The vein and the artery cross at\r\nthis point, and if they are severed, the blood will flow out very\r\nrapidly. When the vein has been cut below the windpipe, run a knife in\r\non top of the windpipe and sever the blood vessels on that side also.\r\nIf stuck too deep, the pleura will be punctured and the blood will\r\nflow into the chest cavity, causing a bloody carcass, which is not\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nThe animal will bleed out if the blood vessels on one side only are\r\ncut, but it will bleed more quickly if those on both sides are\r\nsevered. A little practice is required to do it properly, but when\r\nonce learned it is not easily forgotten.\r\n\r\nBleeding can be accomplished, but not so rapidly, if the throat of the\r\nanimal is simply cut, just back of the jaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 28. Skinning and Gutting\r\n\r\nBegin skinning the carcass as it lies on its side, by splitting the\r\nskin down the face from the poll to the nose. Skin the face back over\r\nthe eyes on both sides and down over the cheeks. Cut around the base\r\nof the horns, leaving the ears on the hide. Split the skin from the\r\nchin down the throat to meet the incision made in bleeding. Skin jaws,\r\nsides of neck, and a little distance back of poll. Remove the head by\r\ncutting from just back of jaws to the depression back of the poll. The\r\natlas joint will be found at this point, and may be easily unjointed\r\nby cutting the ligaments which hold it in place.\r\n\r\nThe carcass should then be rolled on its back and held there by a\r\nsmall stick about three feet long, with a sharp spike at the ends. One\r\nend should be stuck in the floor, and the other end braced against the\r\nbrisket.\r\n\r\nSplit the skin over the back of the fore legs from between the dew\r\nclaws to a point three or four inches above the knee. Skin around the\r\nknee and the shin, unjointing the knee at the lowest articulation, and\r\nskin clear down to the hoof. The brisket and forearms should not be\r\nskinned until the carcass is hung up. Cut across the cord over the\r\nhind shin to release the foot. Split the skin from the dew claws to\r\nthe hocks, and up the rear part of the thigh to a point four or six\r\ninches back of the cod or udder. Skin the hock and the shin, removing\r\nthe leg at the lowest joint of the hock. In splitting the skin over\r\nthe hock, the knife should be turned down flat with the edge pointing\r\noutward to avoid gashing the flesh. While the carcass is stretched\r\nflat, it is well to skin down over the rear of the lower thigh, but no\r\nattempt should be made to skin the outside of the thigh until the hind\r\nquarters are raised. After the legs are skinned, split the skin over\r\nthe midline from the breast to the rectum.\r\n\r\nBegin at the flanks and skin along the midline until the side is\r\nnicely started. Then, with a sharp knife held nearly flat against the\r\nsurface, and the hide stretched tightly, remove the skin down over the\r\nsides with steady, downward strokes of the knife. It is important that\r\nthe skin be stretched tight with no wrinkles in it. Care should be\r\ntaken to leave the covering of muscle over the abdomen on the carcass.\r\nIts presence on the hide is not entirely objectionable, but the\r\ncarcass looks better and keeps better with it on. In “siding” a beef,\r\nit is customary to go down nearly to the backbone, leaving the skin\r\nattached at the thighs and at the shoulders. Skin over the buttock and\r\nas far down the rump as possible. Care should be taken at all times to\r\navoid cutting into the flesh, or tearing the membranes covering it. If\r\nthe meat is to be kept fresh for any length of time, mould will form\r\nin such cut places and will be hard to clean off. A coarse cloth and a\r\npail of hot water should be handy while skinning, and all blood spots\r\nshould be wiped from the surface. The cloth should be wrung nearly dry\r\nfor this purpose, and the less water used the better.\r\n\r\nOpen the carcass at the belly with a knife and pull the small\r\nintestines out to one side. Open the brisket and pelvis with a saw or\r\nsharp ax. Raise the windpipe and the gullet and cut loose the pleura\r\nand diaphragm along the lower part of the cavity. The carcass is now\r\nready to raise. Make an opening with a knife between the large tendon\r\nand the bone just above the hocks. Insert the ends of a single tree in\r\nthe openings thus made. Hook one end of a block and tackle in the ring\r\nin the center of the single tree and hoist until the hind quarters\r\nclear the ground several inches. A gambrel, similar to the one used in\r\nhanging up a hog carcass, though larger and stronger, may be used\r\ninstead of a single tree.\r\n\r\nWhile the carcass is in this position, loosen the rectum and small\r\nintestines and allow them to drop down over the paunch. The fat lining\r\nthe pelvis and the kidney fat should not be disturbed or mutilated.\r\nThe intestines are attached to the liver, from which they may be\r\nseparated with a knife. The paunch is attached to the back at the left\r\nside. It should be pressed down with sufficient force to tear it\r\nloose. Let it roll out on to the ground or floor, and cut off or draw\r\nout the gullet. Raise the carcass a little higher and take out the\r\nliver, first removing the gall bladder. Remove the diaphragm, lungs,\r\nand heart, and finish skinning over the shoulders, arms and neck. Wipe\r\noff all blood and dirt with a cloth. Split the carcass into halves\r\nwith a saw, a cleaver, or a sharp ax. Wash out the inside of the chest\r\ncavity with warm water, and wipe it dry. Trim off all bloody veins or\r\nany scraggy pieces of the neck, and leave the beef to cool before\r\ncutting it into quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 29. Treatment of Hides\r\n\r\nThe skins of cattle represent considerable value if properly treated.\r\nTo save them in the north where cold weather prevails during the\r\nbutchering season is not difficult, as they can be rolled up and kept\r\nfrozen until disposed of. However, in the warm seasons, they should be\r\nspread out flat, hair side down, the legs, flanks, etc. stretched, and\r\nall parts rubbed thoroughly with salt. Particular pains should be\r\ntaken to treat the entire surface of the skin. If more than one skin\r\nis to be salted, they should be salted one at a time and should be\r\nspread one on top of the other, with the hair sides together, and the\r\nskin sides together. Where only one hide is handled, the legs and head\r\nshould be folded in and the hide rolled up. Enough salt should be used\r\nto cure the hide thoroughly if it is to be kept for any length of\r\ntime. Ten to twelve pounds of salt will be sufficient for an ordinary\r\nhide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Killing and Dressing Sheep\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch of the sheepy flavor of mutton comes from the generation of\r\ngases in the stomach after the sheep is killed. For this reason, the\r\nsheep should always be dressed as rapidly as possible. A platform\r\nabout eighteen inches high is convenient to work on and aids in\r\nkeeping the blood away from the body, insuring a cleaner carcass. A\r\nclean, dry place is necessary for neat work. Water or blood on the\r\nwool makes it very difficult to dress the animal nicely.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 30. Stunning and Bleeding\r\n\r\nIf the sheep is an old one, it may be stunned before bleeding. If a\r\nyoung one, the same purpose is served by dislocating the neck. This is\r\naccomplished by putting one hand on top of the head or poll and the\r\nother hand under the chin and giving a sharp twist upward. Then lay\r\nthe sheep on its side on the platform, with its head hanging over one\r\nend. Grasp the chin in the left hand and stick a knife through the\r\nneck just back of the lower jaw. The cutting edge of the knife should\r\nbe turned to the spinal column and the cut be made through the flesh\r\nto the bone. In this way it is possible to sever the blood vessels\r\nwithout cutting the windpipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 31. Skinning\r\n\r\nSplit the skin over the back of the front legs from the dew claws to a\r\nlittle above the knees. Open the skin over the windpipe from brisket\r\nto chin, starting it slightly on the sides of the neck. Split the skin\r\nover the back of the hind legs to midline, and skin the buttock. The\r\nskin should also be raised over the cod and flanks. Skin around the\r\nhocks and down to the hoofs, cutting off the hind feet at the toe\r\njoints. No attempt should be made to skin the legs above the hocks\r\nuntil after the carcass is hung up. Hang the sheep up by the hind legs\r\nand split the skin over the midline. Start at the brisket and “fist\r\noff” the skin. This is done by grasping the edge of the pelt firmly in\r\none hand, pulling it up tight and working the other close between the\r\npelt and the body. The “fisting off” should be downward over the fore\r\nquarter and upward and backward over the hind quarters and legs. It is\r\nunwise to pull down on the skin over the hind legs, as the membrane\r\ncovering the flesh is sure to be ruptured and an unsightly appearance\r\ngiven to the carcass. The wool should always be held away from the\r\nflesh for the sake of cleanliness. The skin on the legs should be\r\npulled away from the body, rather than toward it, in order to preserve\r\nthe covering of the meat. When the pelt has been loosened over the\r\nsides and back, it should be stripped down over the neck and cut off\r\nclose to the ears. The head may then be removed without being skinned\r\nby cutting through the atlas joint.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 32. Gutting\r\n\r\nBegin removing the entrails by cutting around the rectum and allowing\r\nit to drop down the inside of the carcass. Do not split the pelvis.\r\nOpen down the belly line from the cod to the breastbone, and take out\r\nthe paunch and the intestines, leaving the liver attached to the\r\ndiaphragm. The heart, lungs and diaphragm may either be removed or\r\nallowed to remain in the carcass. Reach up into the pelvis and pull\r\nout the bladder. Wipe all blood and dirt from the carcass with a\r\ncoarse cloth wrung nearly dry from hot water. Double up the front legs\r\nand slip over the ankle joint the little cord which is found by\r\ncutting into the fleshy part of the forearm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Bleeding and Dressing Poultry\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 33. Bleeding and Picking\r\n\r\nWhen only a few chickens are to be dressed, the simplest way of\r\nbleeding is to chop off the head with an ax or cleaver. They should be\r\nscalded at once and picked. Scalding causes the muscles at the base of\r\nthe feathers to relax, so the feathers come out easily. After picking,\r\nthe skin can be made firm by plunging the bird in cold water. The crop\r\nand intestines should be removed as soon as the skin is cooled.\r\n\r\nIf the bird is to be dry picked, it should be bled by cutting the\r\nblood vessels in the head and puncturing the brain. For this\r\npurpose, a scalpel or a small knife, is used. The instrument must be\r\npointed and very sharp. The bird is grasped by the head with the\r\nleft hand, and with the right hand the scalpel is thrust upward\r\ninside the mouth at the back of the throat. If done properly, the\r\nbird will bleed almost as fast as when the entire head is removed.\r\nThe knife should be thrust clear through to the brain so the bird\r\nwill be stunned. Stunning the bird in this way has the same effect\r\nas scalding, in that it causes the muscles at the base of the\r\nfeathers to relax so that the feathers can be easily plucked out. If\r\nthe bird is not stunned, the feathers will not pull out so readily.\r\nThe bird should be hung up by the feet and picked immediately,\r\nbefore the body gets cold and the feathers set. A few at a time\r\nshould be grasped between the thumb and first finger, and the pull\r\nshould be upward and backward, in the direction which the feathers\r\nnaturally lie.\r\n\r\nTurkeys, geese and ducks are usually bled and dry picked. Immediately\r\nafter bleeding they should be suspended from a hook and picked, in the\r\nsame way that a fowl is dry picked.\r\n\r\nOwing to the thickness of the feathers on ducks and geese, dry picking\r\nwith them is usually a slower process than with other birds. After\r\nbleeding, a cloth should be wrapped around the head to catch the\r\nblood, so that the feathers will not become bloody. The goose or duck\r\nshould then be laid on a board on the top of an open barrel or jar,\r\nand the feathers dropped into the vessel as they are picked. The\r\ncoarse wing feathers should be kept separate from the softer feathers.\r\nWhen the feathers have been removed the short down may removed by\r\nsingeing with a gasoline or alcohol flame. A hot flame should not be\r\nused, as it will give an oily appearance to the skin.\r\n\r\nWhen it is not desired to save the feathers, quicker work may be done\r\nby scalding the birds and wrapping them for a few minutes in a sack or\r\nblanket to steam. Since there is danger of their being steamed too\r\nmuch, they should be closely watched, and, as soon as the feathers\r\ncome out readily, they are ready to be picked, singed, and then cooled\r\nby plunging into cold water. The sudden cooling hardens the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Keeping Meat Fresh\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the sub-tropical climate of Canton, it is difficult to keep meat\r\nfresh for any length of time without the use of ice. With a room\r\ntemperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and above, meat will keep fresh\r\nbut a few hours. If placed in a refrigerator with a temperature of\r\nfrom 34 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit, it will keep fresh for a week to ten\r\ndays. Dry air should circulate freely through the refrigerator.\r\nMoisture in the refrigerator tends to develop mould, which is apt to\r\ncause decomposition of the meat. A little decay will soon contaminate\r\na large amount of meat.\r\n\r\nIn the north, meat may be kept fresh during the cold season by\r\nfreezing it solid. The carcass may be cut into quarters or smaller\r\npieces and hung in an open outbuilding where it will freeze solid, and\r\nremain frozen until the weather begins to warm up in the spring.\r\nWhenever a piece is wanted it can be removed with a saw. Rapid thawing\r\nof frozen meat greatly injures its flavor. If the meat is thawed out\r\nslowly in a cold room, the flavor of the meat will not be injured.\r\nMeat can be kept frozen for months if kept in cold room, or in a\r\nrefrigerator with a temperature below 32 degrees Fahrenheit and with\r\nproper ventilation provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Curing Meats: American Methods\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 34. Preparing the Meat for Curing\r\n\r\nMeat should be thoroughly cooled before it is cured, or it will spoil.\r\nThe proper time to begin curing is when the meat is cooled and still\r\nfresh. Twenty to thirty hours after killing is the proper time to\r\nbegin the cure. If salted before the animal heat has left it, the\r\nshrinkage of muscles causes a retention of gases, and gives an\r\noffensive odor to the meat. The meat should not be frozen, as the cure\r\nwill not penetrate such meat evenly, and an uneven curing will result.\r\nTainted meat may be cured so that it will keep, but no system of\r\ncuring will bring back the natural flavor of the meat, if it is once\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 35. Vessels for Curing\r\n\r\nVitrified clay jars, with straight sides, similar to the jars used for\r\nfermenting beans in making soy bean sauce, are the best vessels for\r\ncontaining the meat. These jars, large enough to hold conveniently the\r\nhams, shoulders, and sides of two hogs, are best for curing meat for\r\nthe first time, and the meat can be watched and cared for better in\r\nsmall jars than in large jars containing more meat. In America, where\r\nsuch jars are expensive, it is the custom to use a clean, hardwood\r\nbarrel for the purpose. One that has been used for syrup or molasses\r\nis best. If a kerosene or tar barrel is used, it should be first\r\nthoroughly burned out, and used as a water barrel for some time before\r\nit is used for meat. Vitrified clay jars are preferred to wooden\r\nbarrels as they are cleaned more readily. If meat has once spoiled in\r\na wooden barrel, the vessel should not be used again for containing\r\nmeat. Vessels that are used repeatedly for curing meat should be\r\nscalded thoroughly each time before packing with fresh meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 36. Curing Agents\r\n\r\nSalt, saltpeter, sugar or molasses, and a variety of spices are the\r\nprincipal preservatives used in curing meat. Borax, formalin,\r\nsalicylic acid, and other chemicals are sometimes used. However, as\r\nthey are considered by many authorities to be injurious to the health,\r\ntheir use should be avoided. Baking soda is used in wet pickles to\r\ncheck the growth of mould.\r\n\r\nWhen salt alone is applied to meat, it draws out the meat juices and\r\ncontracts the muscle fibers, making the meat very hard and dry. The\r\naction of the sugar or the molasses is to soften the muscle fibers and\r\nimprove the texture and flavor of the meat, hence the combination of\r\nsugar and salt make a good cure. Saltpeter is used to preserve the\r\nnatural red color of the meat. It should be used in small quantities\r\nonly, as it is very astringent, and, if used in large quantities is\r\napt to be injurious to the health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Wet and Dry Cures Compared\r\n\r\n\r\nA wet cure is more convenient than a dry cure. It is less trouble to\r\npack the meat in a jar or barrel and pour on the prepared wet pickle\r\nthan it is to go over the meat three or four times and rub in the\r\nspices. The brine method also gives protection from insects. However,\r\nin warm weather, the brine has to be watched very closely, and, if\r\nmould forms on the surface of the pickle, it should be removed every\r\nday or two. The brine also needs to be recooked every week or ten days\r\nin warm weather to prevent undesirable bacteria from growing in it. A\r\ncool, dry room is the best for either brine or dry curing. In a dry\r\natmosphere below 60 degrees Fahrenheit there is very little danger of\r\nthe meat becoming sour, although a temperature below 40 degrees is\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Recipes for Curing Meat\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 37. Corned Beef\r\n\r\nAny piece of beef can be used for corning, but the cheaper cuts are\r\nthe parts generally used for this purpose. The plate, rump, and parts\r\nof the chuck are generally used, although the ribs, loin, and round\r\nmay also be used. The pieces for corning should be cut into pieces of\r\nconvenient size, say four or five inches square. If they are cut much\r\nlarger, they well not cure very well as the pickle will not work in\r\nsoon enough. They should be cut as nearly the same size as is possible\r\nso they will pack in even layers in the barrel or jar.\r\n\r\nWhen as the meat is thoroughly cooled, it should be corned as quickly\r\nas possible. Weigh the meat and allow 10 pounds of salt for each 100\r\npounds of meat. Sprinkle a layer of salt a half inch deep over the\r\nbottom of the jar in which the meat is to be placed. Rub each piece of\r\nmeat with good, clean salt. Pack each layer of meat closely in the\r\nbottom of the jar, and sprinkle a layer of salt one-fourth to one-half\r\ninch deep on each layer of meat before the following layer of meat is\r\nplaced in the jar, and cover the top layer of meat with a good layer\r\nof salt. After it has stood over night, cover with a brine made as\r\nfollows: for each one hundred pounds of meat, use four pounds of\r\nsugar, six ounces baking soda, and eight ounces of saltpeter. Dissolve\r\nin a gallon of water that has been boiled and cooled until it is\r\ntepid. Three gallons more of boiled, tepid water should then be added.\r\nMeat from fat animals makes choicer corned beef than that from poor\r\nanimals. Under no circumstances should meat be corned while it is\r\nfrozen.\r\n\r\nIn case of more or less than one hundred pounds of meat to be corned,\r\nmake the brine in the proportion given. The meat should be weighted\r\ndown with a board and stone so that all the meat is well beneath the\r\nsurface of the brine. In case any of the meat projects above the\r\nsurface, decay will commence in a short time.\r\n\r\nIt is best to cook the brine, or the water used in making the\r\nbrine solution. If the weather is warm, the brine is apt to get sour\r\nand ropy. In that case, wash each piece of meat in cold water,\r\nscald the vessel and repack in a new brine. If the brine is reboiled\r\nevery few days before it gets ropy, it is not necessary to make new\r\nbrine so frequently. To test the brine for freshness, dip the fingers\r\ninto it, and if it does not drip freely from the fingers, but appears\r\nstringy or ropy, it should be turned off, the meat washed, and new\r\nbrine added. In the spring of the year, the brine should be watched\r\nclosely, as it is more likely to spoil at that time than during the cold\r\nwinter months. If kept in a cool place, with a uniform temperature\r\nof below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and above freezing, there should be\r\nlittle trouble from this source. To secure thorough corning, the\r\nmeat should be kept in the brine for twenty-eight to forty days, the\r\nexact length of time depending on the size of the pieces of meat and\r\non the weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 38. Dried Beef\r\n\r\nThe round and shoulders are the parts most commonly used for dried\r\nbeef. The pieces should be cut with the grain, so that the muscle\r\nfibers will be cut crosswise when the dried beef is sliced for table\r\nuse. It should be cut in about the same sizes as for corned beef, and\r\npacked in vessels in the same manner. The pickle should be made as\r\nfollows: for each one hundred pounds of meat, weigh out six pounds\r\ntable salt, three pounds of granulated sugar, and two ounces of\r\nsaltpeter. Mix these pieces thoroughly. Before the meat is placed in\r\nthe jar, each piece should be well rubbed with the spice mixture.\r\nDissolve the remainder of the spices in four gallons of boiled water\r\nthat has been allowed to cool. Pour this pickle solution over the meat\r\nin the jar until it is completely covered. Weight the meat down, as in\r\nthe case with corned beef. The pickle solution should be watched and,\r\nin the case of tendency to become ropy, should be handled as in\r\ncorning beef.\r\n\r\nAfter ten days, the meat should be removed from the pickle and hung up\r\nin an airy out-house to drip and dry. When dry, which should be in\r\nabout 24 hours, it can be smoked, as in the case of smoking ham. The\r\ndrier the climate, the more easily can the meat be dried and smoked.\r\nIt is difficult to dry and smoke meat in the Canton region unless done\r\nin December and January, before the rains begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 39. Plain Salt Pork\r\n\r\nRub each piece of meat with fine common salt and pack closely in a\r\nbarrel. Let stand over night. The next day, weigh out twelve pounds of\r\nsalt and three ounces of saltpeter to each one hundred pounds of meat,\r\nand dissolve in four gallons of boiling water. When cold, pour this\r\npickle over the meat, cover and weight down to keep the meat under the\r\nbrine. The meat will pack best if cut into pieces about six inches\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 40. Dry Cured Pork\r\n\r\nFor each one hundred pounds of meat, weigh cut eight pounds of salt,\r\ntwo pounds of granulated sugar, and two ounces of saltpeter. Mix\r\nthoroughly, and rub the meat once every three days, using a third of\r\nthe mixture at each rubbing. Keep the meat on a shelf, or in a vessel,\r\nwhile curing. After the last rubbing, allow the meat to remain in a\r\nvessel for about ten days, when it is cured and ready to smoke. To\r\ncure nicely, it is desirable to have a cool and rather moist place in\r\nwhich to keep it.\r\n\r\nThis recipe should not be used where the meat must be kept in a warm\r\ndry place, as the preservatives will not penetrate easily and\r\nuniformly under such conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 41. Sugar Cured Pork\r\n\r\nRub each piece with salt and allow to remain over night. A wet pickle,\r\nor brine, may also be forced into the hams and shoulders close to the\r\nbone with a special pump, using from 5 to 10 ounces of the pickle or\r\nbrine for each piece, the amount depending on the size of the piece.\r\nThe following morning pack in a vessel with the hams and shoulders at\r\nthe bottom and the bacon on the top. For each one hundred pounds of\r\nmeat, weigh out eight pounds of salt, two pounds of brown sugar, two\r\nounces of saltpeter, and one-half pound baking soda. Dissolve all in\r\nfour gallons of water, and cover the meat with this wet pickle. In\r\nwarm weather, the pickle should be boiled and thoroughly cooled before\r\nusing. A board and stone should be used to weight down the meat. Bacon\r\nstrips should remain in the pickle from three to four weeks, and the\r\nhams and shoulders five to seven weeks, depending on their size. If\r\ndesired, the meat may then be smoked. Before being smoked meat should\r\nbe soaked for several hours in clean water at about 80 degrees\r\nFahrenheit to remove the excess salt on the surface of the meat and\r\nthus make the meat more palatable. In soaking the meat about one-half\r\npint of water should be used for each pound of meat.[1] The Canton\r\nChristian College has had very good success with this cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 42. Pork Sausage\r\n\r\nPork sausage should be made from clean, fresh pork only. The parts\r\ngenerally used are the shoulder, neck, and lean meat trimmings. About\r\nthree pounds of lean meat should be used to one pound of fat meat. Mix\r\nthe fat and lean meat together in chopping. With some cutters it is\r\nnecessary to run the meat through twice in order to make it fine\r\nenough and to mix thoroughly the lean with the fat meat. After it has\r\nbeen cut the first time, spread thinly and season. For each 100 pounds\r\nof meat, use one and one-half pounds of pure, fine salt, four ounces\r\nof ground black pepper, and two pounds of pure leaf sage, rubbed fine.\r\nThe seasoning should be sprinkled over the meat, and the meat again\r\nrun through the cutter, in order to mix the spice thoroughly with the\r\nmeat. For immediate use, the sausage may be packed away in jars. It\r\nmay be kept for some time in a jar if melted lard is poured over the\r\ntop, so as to exclude the air. The sausage may also be stuffed into\r\nmuslin bags about two inches in diameter. If the stuffed bags are\r\ncoated with paraffin, they will keep for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 43. Mixed Meat Sausage\r\n\r\nMixed sausage may be made from a mixture of pork and beef in almost\r\nany proportion. Sausage should not contain too much fat. A good\r\nproportion is two pounds of lean pork, one pound of fat pork, and one\r\npound of lean beef.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 44. Bologna Sausage\r\n\r\nTo each ten pounds of lean beef, use one pound of fat pork or bacon.\r\nChop finely and season with three ounces of salt, two ounces pepper,\r\nand a little ground coriander. Stuff casing, and tie every ten or\r\ntwelve inches. Hang the stuffed casings straight. Smoke for ten or\r\ntwelve hours. Cook in boiling water until the sausage floats. Dry on\r\nclean hay or straw in the sun and hang away in a cool place until\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 45. Blood Sausage\r\n\r\nBlood sausage is made with the following ingredients: 25 pounds of\r\ncured pork or shoulder fat, seven pounds cured fat skins, six pounds\r\nof blood, one-half pound onions, one pound salt, one-half ounce white\r\npepper, one ounce sweet marjoram, and one-half ounce cloves.\r\n\r\nCook the fat for one hour and the skins two hours at a temperature of\r\n200° Fahrenheit. When cooked, put through a grinder, grinding quite\r\nfine. Then add the blood and seasoning and mix thoroughly. Stuff into\r\nlarge beef casings and boil in the same water in which meat was cooked\r\nuntil the sausage floats. Then dip the sausage in cold water and hang\r\nup to cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 46. Smoked or Country Sausage\r\n\r\nThe following ingredients are used in making smoked or country\r\nsausage: 85 pounds lean pork, 15 pounds beef, one and one-half to two\r\npounds salt, four ounces black pepper, and one ounce sweet marjoram.\r\n\r\nCut the meat into small pieces and sprinkle seasoning over it. Then\r\ngrind finely. Put away in a cool place for twenty-four to thirty-six\r\nhours, then add a little water, and stuff into hog casings and smoke\r\nin a very cool smoke until a dark mahogany is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 47. Frankfort or Vienna Sausage\r\n\r\nThis popular sausage is made with the following ingredients: 70 pounds\r\nbeef, 30 pounds fat pork, 20 pounds water, one and one-half to two\r\npounds salt, two ounces red pepper.\r\n\r\nCut the beef into small pieces, salt, and allow it to cure for\r\nforty-eight hours in a cool room. Cut the pork into small pieces and\r\nput the beef and pork through a grinder together. Put into a vessel\r\nand add the water and spices. After it is all mixed, put it through a\r\ngrinder again and grind fine. Stuff into sheep casings. Then, by means\r\nof the forefinger and thumb, press the stuffed casing together about\r\nfour inches from one end, and give this first link two or three\r\ntwists. Do the same about every four inches, twisting each succeeding\r\nlink in the opposite direction from the preceding link, in order to\r\nprevent untwisting. Then hang in a smoke house for about two hours at\r\na temperature not to exceed 125° Fahrenheit. After smoking, boil for\r\nfive or ten minutes, then plunge into cold water and hang in a cool\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 48. Liver Sausage\r\n\r\nOdds and ends, resulting from trimming up the various cuts\r\nof the hog carcass, as well as the liver itself, can be used in making\r\nliver sausage. If the head is used, it should first be cleaned, as for\r\nheadcheese. The jowl, which is practically all fat, may be cut off\r\nand made into salt pork, or used for rendering lard. The remainder\r\nof the head meat, trimmings, liver cut into slices, and some beef or\r\nveal, if such meat can be had, should be boiled. Skin that is free\r\nfrom hair, and from which the fat has been removed, is also sometimes\r\nused. The skin will cook before the meat, so it should be\r\nput in a cloth sack and removed when thoroughly cooked. Liver\r\ncooks in a very short time, and should be removed before the rest of\r\nthe meat. The meat should cook until it readily falls from the\r\nbones. All the meat should then be ground in a meat grinder. For\r\n40 pounds of meat, use one and one-half pounds salt, three ounces\r\nsweet marjoram, one ounce allspice, one ounce black pepper, and\r\nabout one gallon broth in which the meat was cooked. Garlic or\r\nonions can be added, if desired. The seasoning should be well worked\r\ninto the meat. It can then be put into jars, covered with paraffin,\r\nor stuffed into beef casings or rounds. When stuffed into casings\r\nor rounds, it should be cooked in the same water the meat was\r\ncooked in until it floats. Then it should be placed in cold water\r\nuntil the sausage is thoroughly cooled.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 49. Summer Sausage\r\n\r\nSummer sausage is made with the following ingredients: 25 pounds cured\r\nbeef free from sinews, 15 pounds pork trimmings, four to six ounces\r\nwhite pepper, one ounce whole black pepper, and one ounce whole\r\nmustard seed.\r\n\r\nThis sausage can be made in cold weather only. All the meat is put\r\nthrough the grinder, and spices added. No salt is needed as the cured\r\nbeef is salty enough. Mix it all thoroughly until it is evenly\r\nseasoned. Spread it out in a cool place for thirty-six to forty hours.\r\nThen stuff into hog casings and let it hang over night. Smoke with\r\ncold smoke for several days. If kept in a dry place, it can be kept\r\nthe year round. It if gets moldy, simply wipe off the mold before using.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 50. Headcheese\r\n\r\nThe head of the hog, and trimmings, are used for making headcheese.\r\nThe head should be shaved clean and nostrils cut off just in front of\r\nthe eyes. Cut out the eyes and ear drums. The fattest part of the head\r\nis generally used for lard. Clean the head by soaking it in water for\r\nsome time to extract all blood and dirt. After the head is thoroughly\r\ncleaned, cover with water and boil until the meat separates from the\r\nbones. Lungs and heart may be cooked with the head. When it is\r\nthoroughly cooked, take out the meat, saving the liquor for future\r\nuse. Chop the meat finely. Season with one and one-half pounds salt,\r\nthree ounces black pepper, four ounces allspice, and four ounces\r\nground cloves, together with two gallons of the liquor for every 50\r\npounds of meat. The mixing should be done thoroughly, so that proper\r\nseasoning is secured. Stuff the meat into large beef casings\r\nthoroughly cleaned, hog stomach, or muslin bags about three or four\r\ninches in diameter. After stuffing into casings, it should be boiled\r\nuntil it floats on the top, then place in cold water for a short time.\r\nStore away in a clean, cool place on a shelf or table. If there are no\r\ncasings or muslin available in which to stuff the meat, it can be kept\r\nin shallow pans.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 51. Scrapple\r\n\r\nThe head and feet of hogs are generally used in making scrapple, but\r\nscrapple can be made from any hog meat. The heads should be split\r\nthrough the middle and placed in a kettle with sufficient water to\r\ncover them. They should be cooked until the meat falls from the bones.\r\nDrain off the broth. Separate the bones from the meat, then chop the\r\nmeat fine and add it to the broth, and boil. Corn meal should be added\r\nuntil it is as thick as mush. Add the corn meal slowly and stir\r\nvigorously, so as to avoid lumpiness. Stir the mixture well for ten or\r\nfifteen minutes, and allow it to boil one hour. Pour the scrapple into\r\nshallow pans or molds. When cold, it should be sliced and fried.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 52. Snow Packing\r\n\r\nSnow packing is a method that can be used only in localities where\r\nsnow and continued dry cold weather prevails during the winter months.\r\nThe carcass should be cut into steaks, roasts, and boiling pieces. All\r\ntrimmings for the table should be made before freezing the meat. Lay\r\nthe pieces out to freeze. Be sure they freeze solid to the center. In\r\nthe bottom of a box large enough to hold all the meat, pack a layer of\r\nsnow. Put in a larger of the frozen meat, packing in such a way that\r\nthe pieces do not touch each other. Cover with a layer of snow, and\r\ncontinue with alternate layers of meat and snow. Set the box in a room\r\nwhere it will not be subject to changes in temperature. For\r\nconvenience, it is well to pack the steaks in one section or end of\r\nthe box, and the roasts and stews in another. The meat will then be\r\nbut little disturbed when a supply is taken from the box. Only snow\r\nshould be used in packing. Be sure the meat is frozen solid before\r\npacking, and it will keep through the winter, unless the weather gets\r\nvery warm. In preparing the meat for the table, it should not be\r\nthawed out too rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 53. Partial Cooking\r\n\r\nPartial cooking and packing in jars is a method of preserving meat\r\nwhich is sometimes used on the farm. It has the advantage over snow\r\npacking in that it can be done in warm weather and is a most\r\nsatisfactory way of keeping fresh pork. However, it requires\r\nconsiderably more work than other methods of preserving meat.\r\n\r\nThe loin and side meat, or any part of the carcass, may be used. Cut\r\ninto slices about one-half inch thick, and fry until a little more\r\nthan half done. Pack the slices in a jar and cover with hot lard. As\r\nthe meat is wanted, it can be removed from the jar and warmed up. If\r\nthe jar is to stand any length of time without using, after it has\r\nbeen opened, it is best again to cover the top with lard. It is better\r\nto use several small jars than one large one. They should be kept in a\r\ncool, dark room to insure safe-keeping of the meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 54. Rendering Lard\r\n\r\nThe leaf lard, fat back, and fat trimmings from the hams, shoulders\r\nand neck make good lard. Intestinal fat should never be mixed with the\r\nother fat parts, as it makes a strong smelling lard of an inferior\r\ngrade, but should be rendered by itself. By thorough washing and\r\nsoaking in cold water for several hours, part of the offensive odor\r\nwill leave it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, remove the skin from the fat trimmings. To do this,\r\nplace the meat on a table, skin side down, and cut the fat from the\r\nskin, using a strong knife. When a piece of skin large enough to grasp\r\nis freed from the fat, take it in the left hand, and, with the right\r\nhand, insert the knife between the skin and fat. Pull the skin and cut\r\nwith the knife slightly slanted downward. With a little practice, the\r\nfat can be cleanly removed from the skin in this way with one clean\r\ncut of the knife. The strips of fat should then be cut into cubes of\r\none to one and one-half inches, making them about equal in size so\r\nthey will try out evenly.\r\n\r\nPour into the kettle about a quart of water or melted lard, and then\r\nfill it nearly full with the cubes of fat meat. The fat will then heat\r\nproperly and the lard will be brought out without burning. Keep a\r\nmoderate fire until the cracklings are brown and light enough to\r\nfloat. Frequent stirring is necessary to prevent burning. When done,\r\nremove from the fire and allow to cool slightly. Then strain through a\r\nmuslin cloth into a jar. Stir it occasionally, until it is cool enough\r\nto begin to solidify. Stirring while it is cooling tends to whiten the\r\nlard and make it smoother. A quarter of a pound of saleratus added to\r\neach one hundred pounds of fat has a like effect.\r\n\r\nWhen removing lard from a container for use, take it evenly from the\r\nsurface. Do not dig down into the center of the lard, for when this is\r\ndone, it will leave a coating of lard around the sides of the\r\ncontainer which will become rancid very quickly by the action of\r\nbacteria in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 55. Smoked Meats\r\n\r\nThe process of smoking helps to preserve meat, and, if smoked\r\nproperly, and with the right kind of fuel, adds a desirable flavor to\r\nmeat. The creosote formed by the combustion of the wood closes the\r\npores to some extent, and excludes the air. This also helps to keep\r\nout the insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 56. The Smokehouse\r\n\r\nThe size of smokehouse to build depends on the amount of meat that is\r\nto be smoked. In a house eight feet square and ten feet high, the\r\nhams, sides, and shoulders of three to five hogs can be smoked at one\r\ntime. Ventilation should be provided to carry off the warm air in\r\norder to prevent overheating the meat. A chimney, made by placing a\r\nsix inch tile in the roof, makes a good ventilator. The smoke house\r\nwalls may be built of lumber, brick, or concrete. Lumber would be the\r\ncheapest, but least permanent, and concrete the most costly. Brick is\r\nno doubt the most satisfactory material for a small smoke house in\r\nsouthern China. Mud bricks may be used, but burnt clay bricks are more\r\nlasting. The roof should be made of tile. The best material for the\r\nfloor is large square tiles, called in Chinese _taai ch’uen_ (大磚).\r\nConcrete or brick may also be used, but would be more expensive then\r\n_taai ch’uen_.\r\n\r\nA good arrangement is to have the fire box outside the smoke house,\r\nwith a flue to carry the smoke into the smoke house. When this cannot\r\nwell be arranged, a fire may be built on the floor of the house, and\r\nthe meat shielded from heavy smoke by a sheet of tin, about four feet\r\nsquare, placed over the fire between the fire and the meat, about\r\nthree feet above the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 57. The Fuel\r\n\r\nLychee, or any other hard wood, makes good fuel for smoking meat.\r\nResinous woods, such as pines and cedars, should never be used as they\r\ngive an objectionable flavor to the meat due to turpentine which they\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 58. Preparing Meat for Smoking\r\n\r\nMeat that is to be smoked should be removed from the brine and\r\nthoroughly washed in tepid water in order to clean off the coat of\r\npickle that has formed on the surface of the meat. It can then he hung\r\nup in the smokehouse, but should be allowed to drain for a day or two\r\nbefore the fire is started. The pieces of meat should be hung so that\r\nthe air can pass freely between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 59. The Fire\r\n\r\nFor the first day or two, the fire should be slow, in order that the\r\nwarming of the meat may be gradual. In clear, dry weather, smoking may\r\ncontinue from the day the smoking begins until it is completed, which\r\nshould be in one to three weeks, the length of time depending on the\r\nsize of the pieces of meat and on the weather. When sufficiently\r\nsmoked, the meat will have a characteristic straw color. Meat should\r\nnever be smoked on a damp day, because in a damp atmosphere moisture\r\nwill condense on the meat, and moist meat will not smoke well. Light\r\nsmoking for two weeks is better than heavy smoking for one week. With\r\na longer period of smoking the smoke will enter the meat more\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 60. Keeping Smoked Meats\r\n\r\nDuring cool weather smoked meats may be left in the smokehouse for\r\nsome time after the smoking process is completed. The house should be\r\nkept dark in order to keep out flies, and it should be well ventilated\r\nso as to prevent dampness. A dry, cool cellar, with free circulation\r\nof fresh air, will be a satisfactory place for keeping smoked meats.\r\n\r\nIf the smoked meat is to be kept only a short time, it needs only to\r\nbe hung up without covering. For longer keeping, it is well to wrap\r\nfirst in paper, and then in burlap, canvass or muslin, and bury the\r\nmeat in a grain bin or box of sand. The object of this is to provide a\r\ncondition which will be uniform in temperature and keep out insects.\r\n\r\nA coat of ground pepper, rubbed into the meat before wrapping, will be\r\ndistasteful to insects.\r\n\r\nAfter smoked meat has become thoroughly dry, it may be wrapped in\r\nparchment paper and enclosed in a heavy muslin or canvass, which\r\nshould be covered with yellow wash or ordinary lime white wash with\r\nglue added.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 61. Recipe for Yellow Wash\r\n\r\nFor one hundred pounds hams or bacon, take: three pounds barytes\r\n(barium sulphate), .06 pound glue, .80 pound chrome yellow (lead\r\nchromate), .40 pound flour, and twelve pounds water.\r\n\r\nPut the flour in the water, dissolving all lumps thoroughly. Dissolve\r\nthe chrome in a quart of water in a separate vessel, and add the\r\nsolution and the glue to the flour and water. Bring the whole to a\r\nboil, and add the barytes slowly, stirring constantly. Make the wash\r\nthe day before it is required. Stir it frequently when using, and\r\napply with a brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Chinese Meat Recipes\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 62. Bean Sauce Sausage (_Laap Ch’eung_ 腊腸).\r\n\r\nSausage is a very popular meat with the Chinese, especially during the\r\nwinter season. It is probably the most widely used of all cured meats,\r\nalthough as a rule it is quite expensive compared with other meats.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 63. Pickle for Bean Sauce Sausage\r\n\r\nFor every catty of meat, use:\r\n\r\n  Saltpeter (_siu_ 硝) 1 mace[2] (_ts’in_ 一錢)\r\n  Salt (_shuk im_ 熟鹽) 3 mace (_ts’in_ 三錢)\r\n  Sugar (_ping fa t’ong_ 冰花糖) 2 mace (_ts’in_ 二錢)\r\n  First-drawn bean sauce (_t’au ch’au yau_ 頭抽油) 2 mace\r\n  Raw bean sauce (_shang ch’au yau_ 生抽油) 1 mace\r\n  Mixture of spices (_ng heung fan_ 五香粉) 1 mace\r\n\r\nThe mixture of spices is made up of the following:\r\n\r\n  Red pepper (_ch’un tsiu_ 春椒) 10 mace\r\n  Ground anise seed (_taai wui_ 大回) 10 mace\r\n  Cloves (_ting heung_ 丁香) 10 mace\r\n  Cinnamon (_yuk kwai_ 玉桂) 10 mace\r\n\r\nThese spices should be purchased separately and never ready mixed, as\r\nready made mixtures are often worthless.\r\n\r\nSometimes two orange peelings, finely cut or ground, fresh or dried\r\nare used for every ten catties of meat. Two mace of double distilled\r\nwine (_sheung ching tsau_ 雙蒸酒), or treble distilled wine (_saam ching\r\ntsau_ 三蒸酒), and a wine called (_fan tsau_ 汾酒), are sometimes added\r\nfor each catty of meat. The wine helps preserve the meat.\r\n\r\nThe above spices should be carefully mixed and the mixture thoroughly\r\nstirred into the meat. In mixing the spices the usual method is to use\r\nthe hands as mixers. A better way is to use a large spoon, or some\r\nsimilar utensil.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 64. Preparation of the Meat for Sausage\r\n\r\nUse hams, shoulders, chops, fat back, and neck. Sometimes the liver is\r\nadded to give a dark color. No belly meat or tough parts should be\r\nused. Separate the lean from the fat meat. Chop into pieces about\r\none-quarter inch in diameter, or run through a sausage mill. One part\r\nfat and one part lean meat is generally used, though the proportion\r\nmay vary either way, to suit the taste and demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 65. Sausage Casing (_Ch’eung I_ 腸衣)\r\n\r\nSausage casing is generally made from the middle coat of the small\r\nintestines of sheep although it is also made from the intestines of\r\nthe hog. The casing is very thin and transparent. Some casing is\r\nprepared in Canton, but most of what is used in Canton comes from\r\nShanghai, as there are comparatively few sheep or goats slaughtered in\r\nCanton. The dried casing sells for $3.00 to $6.00 a catty.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 66. Softening the Casing\r\n\r\nWhen ready to be used, the casing should be immersed in luke warm\r\nwater for a few minutes to soften it. If the walls of the casing\r\nadhere to each other so that it is difficult for the meat to enter,\r\nwater should be forced through to distend the casing.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 67. Filling the Casing\r\n\r\nInsert the small end of the filler (a tin funnel about six inches\r\nlong) into the end of the casing. Hold the casing tightly to the\r\nfiller with the left hand, and with the right hand force the meat\r\nthrough the filler into the casing. It is customary to use the hand\r\nfor this, but a large wooden spoon would work just as well.\r\n\r\nA sausage stuffing machine can be purchased for a few dollars, and\r\nwill do the work of stuffing in a much more satisfactory manner than\r\nit can be done by hand. The end of the casing is tied around a tube at\r\nthe bottom of a jar containing the sausage meat. A disc the size and\r\nshape of the inside of the jar is then pressed down on the meat with a\r\nlever, and the meat is thus forced into the casing. Such a machine\r\nwill do the work of five or six men, and if of the right type, can\r\nalso be used as a lard press. If it is difficult to force the meat\r\ninto the casing, on account of compressed air, the air should be\r\nallowed to escape by punching small holes in the casing with pins. The\r\nstuffed casing is usually tied with a string every six inches, cut\r\ninto convenient lengths, and hung up to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 68. Sunning and Drying\r\n\r\nThe sausage should be prepared in the morning, so that it can be hung\r\nup to sun by noon. If it is prepared in the afternoon, there is some\r\ndanger of its spoiling, especially if the day is not very cold,\r\nbecause it has to be stored over night before it gets much sun.\r\nSunshine and cold north wind are needed to make the best sausage. With\r\nfive days of wind and sun, the meat becomes hard and firm. In case of\r\nrainy or damp weather while the sausage is being dried, it must be\r\nhung up in a small room and a small charcoal or wood fire kept burning\r\nunderneath. If the sausage is not well sunned or dried, it is very\r\nlikely to spoil, and an effort should be made to get it pretty well\r\ndried within five days.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 69. Season and Weather for Making Sausage\r\n\r\nThe time for making sausage is when there is a dry, cold wind blowing\r\nfrom the north. Such weather usually does not occur before the middle\r\nof November. From this time to the middle of January is usually the\r\nbest season. If made earlier, the weather will not be cool enough. If\r\nmade later, the chances for sunny weather are lessened, and the meat\r\nis not apt to cure so well.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 70. Lean Pork Sausage (_Shau Yuk Ch’eung_ 瘦肉腸)\r\n\r\nThis sausage is made the same as ordinary sausage, except that only\r\nlean meat is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 71. Liver Sausage (_Yun Ch’eung_ 潤腸)\r\n\r\nIn this sausage, duck liver is used instead of lean meat. Otherwise,\r\nit is made the same as ordinary sausage.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 72. _Tung Koon_ Sausage (_Tung Koon Laap Ch’eung_ 東莞腊腸)\r\n\r\nThis is the same as ordinary bean sauce sausage, except that large\r\ncasings are used. It is not very popular because of its size.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 73. Oyster Sauce Sausage (_Ho Yau Ch’eung_ 蠔油腸)\r\n\r\nThis is made in the same manner as ordinary sausage, except that\r\noyster sauce (_ho yau_ 蠔油) is used instead of bean sauce in making up\r\nthe pickle.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 74. Catsup Sausage\r\n\r\nCatsup sausage is the same as ordinary sausage, except that for every\r\ncatty of meat, three taels of catsup instead of bean sauce are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 75. Roast or Baked Sausage (_Foh Ch’eung_ 火腸)\r\n\r\nPrepare ordinary sausage, but use large casings. Dip in honey\r\nsolution, and bake or roast.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 76. Cured Ham\r\n\r\nAn excellent cured ham is produced in Yunnan Province. This is due to\r\nthe fact that the hogs in that region are largely of the bacon type,\r\nand the climate is very favorable for curing meat, being dry and\r\nfairly cool during the meat curing season.\r\n\r\nIn curing ham, the Chinese use much the same method as is used in\r\nwestern countries in making dry cured ham, except that sugar is not\r\nused in the pickle. The pickle is made up as follows: Salt (_shuk im_\r\n熟鹽) 20 catties (_kan_ 卄斤), Saltpeter (_siu_ 硝) .05 tael (半錢),\r\nmixture of spices (_ng heung fan_ 五香粉) 2 taels (_leung_ 二両).\r\n\r\nRub each piece of meat for one-half hour. Puncture the meat with\r\nneedles so the pickle will work in well. Rub again in two days. For\r\nthe two days after the first rubbing with the pickle, keep under\r\npressure to squeeze out the water. After the second two days, rub\r\nagain with the pickle. Rub again after two more days. Then the meat is\r\npacked in salt for fifteen days, when it is taken out and the salt\r\nwiped off and the meat is allowed to dry and harden. Curing should\r\nrequire forty days. The flavor improves with age.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 77. Sun Dried Pork (_Shau Laap Yuk_ 瘦𦡳肉)\r\n\r\nSun drying is a common method of curing pork in the Canton\r\nregion. For this purpose, head, side, ham, and shoulder meat is\r\nused. The meat is cut in strips, about eight to ten inches long, and\r\nabout one inch thick. It is immersed over night in a pickle which\r\nis the same as the one used in making sausage, and the next day\r\nrubbed with a mixture of honey and water (_mat t’ong shui_ 蜜糖水),\r\nmade up of one part honey and one part water, and hung up to dry\r\nin the sun for two days. Again it is soaked in the pickle for a short\r\ntime, and dried in the sun for two days. This is done a third time.\r\nThen it is put in a stone jar in a cool, dry place for two days, and\r\nagain hung up to dry for one week, when it is cured. When cured,\r\nthe fat meat is rather firm.\r\n\r\nPork can be sun dried in the Canton region between the first of\r\nNovember and the middle of January. Dry, north wind is best for\r\ncuring. If cured later than January, it must be consumed immediately\r\nas it will not keep long.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 78. Pickled Pig Feet (_Ch’aat T’ai_ 札蹄)\r\n\r\nIn making pickled pig feet, the bone is first removed from the leg,\r\nleaving only the meat, skin and toes. Boil, and stuff with roast fat\r\nand lean meat to take the place of the bone. Tie up with rice straw,\r\nand immerse in the sausage spice for several hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 79. Pickled Beef\r\n\r\nCut the beef into pieces weighing about four or five taels. Rub each\r\npiece thoroughly with salt. Place the meat in a jar and cover with\r\nsalt. In one or two weeks, the meat is cured and ready to use. Soak in\r\nwater for one-half hour before using in order to remove part of the\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 80. Dried Rice Bird (_Laap Woh Fa Tseuk_ 腊禾花雀)\r\n\r\nRemove the feathers, internal organs, and brain. Then treat same as in\r\nmaking sun dried pork.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 81. Pork Stuffed Liver (_Kam Ngan Yun_ 金銀潤)\r\n\r\nUse the liver of hogs. Cut into strips about one inch wide. Use wine\r\nand ginger for flavoring. Half dry it in the wind. It should not be\r\noverdried, as it will then be hard to digest. Prepare fat meat by\r\ncutting strips of it into such sizes that they can be inserted into\r\nthe liver. Soak the fat meat in a solution of salt, saltpeter, and\r\nsugar, in proportions of 3-2-1. Finally, half dry the fat by hanging\r\nin the sun for several hours. With a wooden stick, make pockets in the\r\nstrips of liver from one end to the other, and insert the strips of\r\nfat meat into the pockets. The strips of stuffed liver should then be\r\nhung up to dry for a half day.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 82. Lo Mei (_Lo Mei_ 鹵味)\r\n\r\nThe tongue, bladder, intestine, and liver, are used in making _lo mei_\r\nalthough any part of the carcass may be used. It is made by cooking\r\nthe meat for ten minutes and then plunging it while still hot into\r\ncold water, cooking for ten minutes again, and then plunging into cold\r\nwater. The process should be repeated at least twelve times. The\r\nexpansion and contraction of the meat by such handling makes it very\r\ntender, and firm. The process of preparing this meat is called\r\n“crossing the river.”\r\n\r\nThe boiled meat should be put into a strong solution of spices\r\nprepared before hand, which is the same as the mixture of spices used\r\nfor making the pickle for sausages. After remaining in the solution of\r\nspices over night, the meat is ready to be eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 83. Roast Meat (_Shiu Yuk_ 燒肉)\r\n\r\nPoultry, or pigs weighing up to one hundred catties, frequently are\r\nroasted. Two methods are used. Poultry and small pigs may be roasted\r\nin pans in an ordinary oven. The other method, which is the one\r\ncommonly used, is to roast in a special oven. The latter method\r\nrequires more skill than roasting in the ordinary oven. The oven is in\r\nthe form of a cylinder stood on end, thirty to forty inches in\r\ndiameter, and five or six feet high. The poultry or pig is hung on\r\niron bars across the top of the stove, and the stove or oven is then\r\ncovered with an iron lid. Fire is built at the bottom of the cylinder\r\nthrough an opening at one side. Dry hard wood or charcoal, which\r\ngive but little smoke, are generally used for fuel. The meat being\r\nroasted needs constant attention and shifting so that it will roast\r\nthrough uniformly. It is said that when the meat gives off a white\r\nsmoke, it is an indication that it is done. A solution made up of one\r\npart honey and one part water is rubbed on the meat, both inside and\r\noutside the carcass, before the roasting. This honey solution gives\r\nthe outside of the meat a desirable rich reddish brown color when\r\nroasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 84. Dried Duck (_Laap Aap_ 腊鴨)\r\n\r\nFor one dressed bird, use five taels of salt, which should be well\r\nrubbed into the meat. Then pack in salt for one day. Take up, wash off\r\nthe salt, and put between two bamboo mats. Apply pressure for a few\r\ndays, and hang up to dry.\r\n\r\nThe Canton climate is not very favorable for drying duck, as during\r\nthe meat curing season it frequently rains. If the meat does not dry\r\nfairly rapidly, it is likely to spoil. In Naam On, Kwong Sai province,\r\nwhere it is generally dry during the curing season, the ducks are\r\npacked away after two days exposure to the sun. In Canton, it often\r\ntakes two weeks. Ducks’ heads, kidneys, feet and other parts of the\r\nbird are also cured in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 85. Puffed Pig Skin (_Chue P’ei_ 豬皮)\r\n\r\nIn making puffed pig skin, the pig skin is first cooked, and then\r\nthoroughly scraped with a knife in order to remove the oil and fat. It\r\nis then hung up in the sun to dry for about ten days. When it is ready\r\nfor the puffing or blistering process, which is accomplished by\r\nroasting the dried skin in hot gravel in a shallow pan over a slow\r\nfire This process whitens and puffs, or blisters, the skin.\r\n\r\nThe puffed pig skin is cut into small cubes and used in soups. It has\r\na spongy appearance with very little taste.\r\n\r\nThe skin on the hams, shoulders, and sides will puff the best, while\r\nthe skin on the back, legs, and belly will not puff well on roasting\r\nin the hot gravel, but can be puffed by roasting in peanut oil.\r\n\r\nOn account of dampness and cloudy weather which interfere with proper\r\ndrying, puffed pig skin is best made during the dry, sunny winter\r\nmonths. The product is on sale, however, throughout the year, as it\r\nkeeps well if hung in a fairly dry, airy place. It is commonly seen\r\nhanging in the front of meat shops in Canton.\r\n\r\n[1] For further details on smoking, see sections 55 to 61.\r\n\r\n[2] Note: 1 mace = 1⁄100 ounce; 16 ounces = 1 catty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        AGRICULTURAL PUBLICATIONS\r\n                                OF THE\r\n                        CANTON CHRISTIAN COLLEGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following agricultural bulletins and publications may be obtained\r\nat the price indicated from College Bookstore, Canton Christian\r\nCollege, Cantor, China.\r\n\r\nBulletin No. 5.
