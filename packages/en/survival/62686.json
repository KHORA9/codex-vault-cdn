This country varies so greatly in\r\nsoil, climate, and flora that it is only possible, within the limits\r\nassigned for the present discussion, to outline general principles\r\neverywhere applicable. Nevertheless, wherever suggestions have\r\napproximated the laying down of rules of practice, the writer has had\r\nmainly in mind the conditions prevalent in our northeastern States.\r\nMoreover, for the reason already referred to, limitation of space, it\r\nhas not been possible to give more than a comprehensive view, without\r\nmuch detail.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding chapters should be read connectedly, as they are more\r\nor less interdependent. The first treats of the behavior of a forest\r\nplant; the second, of the principles which should guide the planter\r\nin setting a crop; the third, of the manner in which a natural forest\r\ncrop should be produced; the fourth points out how the crop should be\r\nmanaged afterwards in order to secure the best results in quantity\r\nand quality of material; while the fifth chapter is devoted to a\r\nconsideration of the relation of forests to farms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. HOW TREES GROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrees, like most other plants, originate from seed, build up a body\r\nof cell tissues, form foliage, flower, and fruit, and take up food\r\nmaterial from the soil and air, which they convert into cellulose and\r\nother compounds, from which all their parts are formed. They rely, like\r\nother plants, upon moisture, heat, and light as the means of performing\r\nthe functions of growth. Yet there are some peculiarities in their\r\nbehavior, their life and growth, which require special attention on the\r\npart of a tree grower or forest planter, and these we shall briefly\r\ndiscuss.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD MATERIALS AND CONDITIONS OF GROWTH.\r\n\r\nTrees derive their food and solid substance in part from the air and\r\nin part from the soil. The solid part of their bodies is made up\r\nof cellulose, which consists largely of carbon (44 per cent of its\r\nweight), with hydrogen and oxygen added in almost the same proportions\r\nas in water. The carbon is derived from the carbonic acid of the air,\r\nwhich enters into the leaves and, under the influence of light, air,\r\nand water, is there decomposed; the oxygen is exhaled; the carbon is\r\nretained and combined with elements derived from the water, forming\r\ncompounds, such as starch, sugar, etc., which are used as food\r\nmaterials, passing down the tree through its outer layers to the very\r\ntips of the roots, making new wood all along the branches, trunk, and\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nThis process of food preparation, called \"assimilation,\" can be\r\ncarried on only in the green parts, and in these only when exposed to\r\nlight and air; hence foliage, air, and light at the top are essential\r\nprerequisites for tree growth, and hence, other conditions being\r\nfavorable, the more foliage and the better developed it is, and the\r\nmore light this foliage has at its disposal for its work, the more\r\nvigorously will the tree grow.\r\n\r\nIn general, therefore, pruning, since it reduces the amount of foliage,\r\nreduces also, for the time, the amount of wood formed; and just so\r\nshading, reducing the activity of foliage, reduces the growth of wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\nFrom the soil trees take mainly water, which enters through the roots\r\nand is carried through the younger part of the tree to the leaves, to\r\nbe used in part on its passage for food and wood formation and in part\r\nto be given up to the air by transpiration.\r\n\r\nIn a vigorously growing tree the solid wood substance itself will\r\ncontain half its weight in the form of water chemically combined, and\r\nthe tree, in addition, will contain from 40 to 65 per cent and more of\r\nits dry weight in water mechanically or \"hygroscopically\" held. This\r\nlast, when the tree is cut, very largely evaporates; yet well-seasoned\r\nwood still contains 10 to 12 per cent of such water. The weight of a\r\ngreen tree, a pine, for instance, is made up, in round numbers, of\r\nabout 30 per cent of carbon and 70 per cent or water, either chemically\r\nor hygroscopically held, while a birch contains a still larger\r\npercentage of water.\r\n\r\nThe largest part of the water which passes through the tree is\r\ntranspired--i. e., given off to the air in vapor. The amounts thus\r\ntranspired during the season vary greatly with the species of tree,\r\nits age, the amount of foliage at work, the amount of light at its\r\ndisposal, the climatic conditions (rain, temperature, winds, relative\r\nhumidity), and the season. These amounts are, however, very large when\r\ncompared with the quantity retained; so that while an acre of forest\r\nmay store in its trees, say, 1,000 pounds of carbon, 15 to 20 pounds\r\nof mineral substances, and 5,000 pounds of water in a year, it will\r\nhave transpired--taken up from, the soil and returned to the air--from\r\n500,000 to 1,500,000 pounds of water (one-quarter to one-half as much\r\nas agricultural crops).\r\n\r\nMineral substances are taken up only in very small quantities, and\r\nthese are mostly the commoner sorts, such as lime, potash, magnesia,\r\nand nitrogen. These are carried in solution to the leaves, where they\r\nare used (as perhaps also on their passage through the tree), with a\r\npart of the water, in food preparation. The main part of the mineral\r\nsubstances taken up remains, however, as the water transpires, in the\r\nleaves and young twigs, and is returned to the soil when the leaves are\r\nshed or when the tree is cut and the brush left to decompose and make\r\nhumus.\r\n\r\nHence the improvement of the fertility of the soil by wood crops is\r\nexplained, the minerals being returned in more soluble form to the\r\nsoil; as also the fact that wood crops do not exhaust the soil of its\r\nminerals, provided the leaves and litter are allowed to remain on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nFor this reason there is no necessity of alternating wood crops, as far\r\nas their mineral needs are concerned; the same kind of trees can be\r\ngrown on the same soil continuously, provided the soil is not allowed\r\nto deteriorate from other causes.\r\n\r\nAs the foliage can perform its work of food assimilation only when\r\nsufficient water is at its disposal, the amount of growth is also\r\ndependent not only on the presence of sufficient sources of supply, but\r\nalso on the opportunity had by the roots to utilize the supply, and\r\nthis opportunity is dependent upon the condition of the soil. If the\r\nsoil is compact, so that the rain water can not penetrate readily, and\r\nruns off superficially, or if it is of coarse grain and so deep that\r\nthe water rapidly sinks out of reach of the roots and can not be drawn\r\nup by capillary action, the water supply is of no avail to the plants;\r\nbut if the soil is porous and moderately deep (depth being the distance\r\nfrom the surface to the impenetrable subsoil, rock, or ground water)\r\nthe water not only can penetrate but also can readily be reached and\r\ntaken up by the roots.\r\n\r\nThe moisture of the soil being the most important element in it for\r\ntree growth, the greatest attention must be given to its conservation\r\nand most advantageous distribution through the soil.\r\n\r\nNo trees grow to the best advantage in very dry or very wet soil,\r\nalthough some can live and almost thrive in such unfavorable\r\nsituations. A moderately but evenly moist soil, porous and deep enough\r\nor fissured enough to be well drained, and yet of such a structure that\r\nthe water supplies from the depths can readily be drawn up and become\r\navailable to the roots--that is the soil on which all trees grow most\r\nthriftily.\r\n\r\nThe agriculturist procures this condition of the soil as far as\r\npossible by plowing, drainage, and irrigation, and he tries by\r\ncultivating to keep the soil from compacting again, as it does under\r\nthe influence of the beating rain and of the drying out of the upper\r\nlayers by sun and wind.\r\n\r\nThe forest grower can not rely upon such methods, because they are\r\neither too expensive or entirely impracticable. He may, indeed, plow\r\nfor his first planting, and cultivate the young trees, but in a few\r\nyears this last operation will become impossible and the effects of the\r\nfirst operation will be lost. He must, therefore, attain his object in\r\nanother manner, namely, by shading and mulching the soil. The shading\r\nis done at first by planting very closely, so that the ground may be\r\nprotected as soon as possible from sun and wind, and by maintaining the\r\nshade well throughout the period of growth. This shade is maintained,\r\nif necessary, by more planting, and in case the main crop in later life\r\nthins out inordinately in the crowns or tops, or by the accidental\r\ndeath of trees, it may even become desirable to introduce an underbrush.\r\n\r\nThe mulching is done by allowing the fallen leaves and twigs to remain\r\nand decay, and form a cover of rich mold or humus. This protective\r\ncover permits the rain and snow waters to penetrate without at the same\r\ntime compacting the soil, keeping it granular and in best condition for\r\nconducting water, and at the same time preventing evaporation at the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe soil moisture, therefore, is best maintained by proper soil cover,\r\nwhich, however, is needful only in naturally dry soils. Wet soils,\r\nalthough supporting tree growth, do not, if constantly wet, produce\r\nsatisfactory wood crops, the growth being very slow. Hence they must be\r\ndrained and their water level sunk below the depth of the root system.\r\n\r\nIrrigation is generally too expensive to be applied to wood crops,\r\nexcept perhaps in the arid regions, where the benefit of the shelter\r\nbelt may warrant the expense.\r\n\r\nAttention to favorable moisture conditions in the soil requires the\r\nselection of such kinds of trees as shade well for a long time, to\r\nplant closely, to protect the woody undergrowth (but not weeds), and to\r\nleave the litter on the ground as a mulch.\r\n\r\nDifferent species, to be sure, adapt themselves to different degrees of\r\nsoil moisture, and the crop should therefore be selected with reference\r\nto its adaptation to available moisture supplies.\r\n\r\nWhile, as stated, all trees thrive best with a moderate and even supply\r\nof moisture, some can get along with very little, like the conifers,\r\nespecially pines; others can exist even with an excessive supply, as\r\nthe bald cypress, honey locust, some oaks, etc. The climate, however,\r\nmust also be considered in this connection, for a tree species,\r\nalthough succeeding well enough on a dry soil in an atmosphere which\r\ndoes not require much transpiration, may not do so in a drier climate\r\non the same soil.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of different kinds of trees for different soils, the\r\nwater conditions of the soil should, therefore, determine the choice.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\nTo insure the largest amount of growth, full enjoyment of sunlight is\r\nneeded. But as light is almost always accompanied by heat and relative\r\ndryness of air, which demands water from the plant, and may increase\r\ntranspiration from the leaves inordinately, making them pump too hard,\r\nas it were, young seedlings of tree species whose foliage is not built\r\nfor such strains require partial shading for the first year or two. The\r\nconifers belong to this class.\r\n\r\nIn later life the light conditions exert a threefold influence on the\r\ndevelopment of the tree, namely, with reference to soil conditions,\r\nwith reference to form development, and with reference to amount of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe art of the forester consists in regulating the light conditions so\r\nas to secure the full benefit of the stimulating effect of light on\r\ngrowth, without its deteriorating influences on the soil and on form\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, shade is desirable in order to preserve soil moisture.\r\nNow, while young trees of all kinds, during the \"brush\" stage of\r\ndevelopment, have a rather dense foliage, as they grow older they\r\nvary in habit, especially when growing in the forest. Some, like the\r\nbeech, the sugar maple, the hemlock, and the spruce, keep up a dense\r\ncrown; others, like the chestnut, the oaks, the walnut, the tulip\r\ntree, and the white pine, thin out more and more, and when fully\r\ngrown have a much less dense foliage; Anally, there are some which do\r\nnot keep up a dense shade for any length of time, like the black and\r\nhoney locust, with their small, thin leaves; the catalpa, with its\r\nlarge but few leaves at the end of the branchlets only, and the larch,\r\nwith its short, scattered bunches of needles. So we can establish a\r\ncomparative scale of trees with reference to the amount of shade which\r\nthey can give continuously, as densely foliaged and thinly foliaged,\r\nin various gradations. If we planted all beech or sugar maple, the\r\ndesirable shading of the soil would never be lacking, while if we\r\nplanted all locust or catalpa the sun would soon reach the soil and\r\ndry it out, or permit a growth of grass or weeds, which is worse,\r\nbecause those transpire still larger quantities of water than the bare\r\nground evaporates or an undergrowth of woody plants would transpire.\r\nOf course, a densely foliaged tree has many more leaves to shed than a\r\nthinly foliaged one, and therefore makes more litter, which increases\r\nthe favorable mulch cover of the soil. Another reason for keeping the\r\nground well shaded is that the litter then decomposes slowly, but into\r\na desirable humus, which acts favorably upon the soil, while if the\r\nlitter is exposed to light, an undesirable, partly decomposed \"raw\"\r\nhumus is apt to be formed.\r\n\r\nFavorable soil conditions, then, require shade, while wood growth is\r\nincreased by full enjoyment of light; to satisfy both requirements,\r\nmixed planting, with proper selection of shade-enduring and\r\nlight-needing species, is resorted to.\r\n\r\nAs the different species afford shade in different degrees, so they\r\nrequire for their development different degrees of light. The dense\r\nfoliage of the beech, with a large number of leaves in the interior\r\nof the crown, proves that the leaves can exist and perform their work\r\nwith a small amount of light; the beech is a shade-enduring tree. The\r\nscanty foliage of the birches, poplars, or pines shows that these are\r\nlight-needing trees; hence they are never found under the dense shade\r\nof the former, while the shade-enduring can develop satisfactorily\r\nunder the light shade of the thin-foliaged kinds. Very favorable soil\r\nconditions increase the shade endurance of the latter, and climatic\r\nconditions also modify their relative position in the scale.\r\n\r\nAll trees ultimately thrive best--i. e., grow most vigorously--in the\r\nfull enjoyment of light, but their energy then goes into branching.\r\nCrowded together, with the side light cut off, the lower lateral\r\nbranches soon die and fall, while the main energy of growth is put into\r\nthe shaft and the height growth is stimulated. The denser shade of the\r\nshade-enduring kinds, if placed as neighbors to light-needing ones, is\r\nmost effective in producing this result, provided that the light is not\r\ncut off at the top; and thus, in practice, advantage is taken of the\r\nrelative requirements for light of the various species.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] This relation of the different species to varying light conditions;\r\ntheir comparative shading value and shade endurance, is one of the most\r\nimportant facts to be observed and utilized by the forester. European\r\nforesters have done this, but since they had to deal with only a few\r\nspecies and over a limited territory, they could quite readily classify\r\ntheir trees with reference to their shade endurance, and take it for\r\ngranted that shade endurance and density of foliage or shading value\r\nwere more or less identical. With our great wealth of useful species it\r\nwill be necessary and profitable to be more exact in the classification.\r\n\r\nThe forester finds in close planting and in mixed growth a means of\r\nsecuring tall, clear trunks, free from knots, and he is able, moreover,\r\nby proper regulation of light conditions, to influence the form\r\ndevelopment, and also the quality of his crop, since slow growth and\r\nrapid growth produce wood of different character.\r\n\r\nThere are some species which, although light-foliaged and giving\r\ncomparatively little shade, are yet shade-enduring--i. e., can subsist,\r\nalthough not develop favorably, under shade; the oaks are examples\r\nof this kind. Others, like the black cherry, bear a dense crown for\r\nthe first twenty years, perhaps, seemingly indicating great shade\r\nendurance; but the fact that the species named soon clears itself\r\nof its branches and finally has a thin crown, indicates that it is\r\nlight-needing, though a good shader for the first period of its life.\r\nOthers, again, like the catalpa, which is shady and shade-enduring, as\r\nthe difficulty with which it clears itself indicates, leaf out so late\r\nand lose their foliage so early that their shading value is thereby\r\nimpaired. Black locust and honey locust, on the other hand, leave\r\nno doubt either as to their light-needing or their inferior shading\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThat soil conditions and climatic conditions also modify crown\r\ndevelopment and shade endurance has been well recognized abroad, but in\r\nour country this influence is of much more importance on account of the\r\ngreat variation in those conditions. Thus the box elder, an excellent\r\nshader in certain portions of the West, is a failure as soil cover in\r\nothers where it nevertheless will grow.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that in determining the shading value as well as the\r\nshade endurance of one species in comparison with another, with\r\nreference to forestry purposes, not only soil and climate but also the\r\ncharacter of foliage and its length of season must be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGY OF TREE GROWTH.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, root and foliage are the main life organs of the tree.\r\nThe trunk and branches serve to carry the crown upward and expose it to\r\nthe light, which is necessary in order to prepare the food and increase\r\nthe volume of the tree, and also as conductors of food materials up\r\nand down between root and foliage. A large part of the roots, too,\r\naside from giving stability to the tree, serve only as conductors of\r\nwater and food material; only the youngest parts, the fibrous roots,\r\nbeset with innumerable fine hairs, serve to take up the water and\r\nminerals from the soil. These fine roots, root hairs, and young parts\r\nare therefore the essential portion of the root system. A tree may\r\nhave a fine, vigorous-looking root system, yet if the young parts and\r\nfibrous roots are cut off or allowed to dry out, which they readily\r\ndo--some kinds more so than others--thereby losing their power to take\r\nup water, such a tree is apt to die. Under very favorable moisture\r\nand temperature conditions, however, the old roots may throw out now\r\nsprouts and replace the fibrous roots. Some species, like the willows,\r\npoplars, locusts, and others, are especially capable of doing so.\r\nAll trees that \"transplant easily\" probably possess this capacity of\r\nrenewing the fibrous roots readily, or else are less subject to drying\r\nout. But it may be stated as a probable fact that most transplanted\r\ntrees which die soon after the planting do so because the fibrous roots\r\nhave been curtailed too much in taking up, or else have been allowed to\r\ndry out on the way from the nursery or forest to the place of planting;\r\nthey were really dead before being set. Conifers--pines, spruces,\r\netc.--are especially sensitive; maples, oaks, catalpas, and apples\r\nwill, in this respect, stand a good deal of abuse.\r\n\r\nHence, in transplanting, the first and foremost care of the forest,\r\ngrower, besides taking the sapling up with least injury, is the proper\r\nprotection of its root fibers against drying out.\r\n\r\nThe water, with the minerals in solution, is taken up by the roots\r\nwhen the soil is warm enough, but to enable the roots to act they must\r\nbe closely packed with the soil. It is conveyed mostly through the\r\nouter, which are the younger, layers of the wood of root, trunk, and\r\nbranches to the leaves. Here, as we have seen, under the influence of\r\nlight and heat it is in large part transpired and in part combined\r\nwith the carbon into organic compounds, sugar, etc., which serve as\r\nfood materials. These travel from the leaf into the branchlet, and\r\ndown through the outer layers of the trunk to the very tips of the\r\nroot, forming new wood all the way, new buds, which lengthen into\r\nshoots, leaves, and flowers, and also new rootlets. To live and grow,\r\ntherefore, the roots need the food elaborated in the leaves, just as\r\nthe leaves need the water sent up from the roots.\r\n\r\nHence the interdependence of root system and crown, which must be kept\r\nin proportion when transplanting. At least, the root system must be\r\nsufficient to supply the needs of the crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SAP UP AND SAP DOWN.\"\r\n\r\nThe growing tree, in all its parts, is more or less saturated with\r\nwater, and as the leaves, under the influence of sun and wind and\r\natmospheric conditions generally transpire, new supplies are taken in\r\nthrough the roots and conveyed to the crown. This movement takes place\r\neven in winter, in a slight degree, to supply the loss of water by\r\nevaporation from the branches. In the growing season it is so active\r\nas to become noticeable; hence the saying that the sap is \"up,\" or\r\n\"rising,\" and when, toward the end of the season, the movement becomes\r\nless, the sap is said to be \"down.\" But this movement of water is\r\nalways upward; hence the notion that there is a stream upward at one\r\nseason and in one part of the tree, and a stream downward at another\r\nseason and perhaps in another part of the tree, is erroneous. The\r\ndownward movement is of food materials, and the two movements of water\r\nupward and food downward take place simultaneously, and depend, in\r\npart at least, one upon the other, the food being carried to the young\r\nparts, wherever required, by a process of diffusion from cell to cell\r\nknown as \"osmosis.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Physiological importance of different parts of\r\nthe tree; pathways of water and food materials. (Schematic.)]\r\n\r\nThese food materials are, by the life processes of the active cells,\r\nchanged in chemical composition as need be, from sugar, which is\r\nsoluble, into starch, which is insoluble, and back into sugar, and\r\ncombined with nitrogenous substances to make the cell-forming material,\r\nprotoplasm (fig. 1).\r\n\r\nIn the fall, when the leaves cease to elaborate food, both the upward\r\nand the downward movement, more or less simultaneously, come to rest\r\n(the surplus of food materials, as starch, and sometimes as sugar,\r\nbeing stored for the winter in certain cell tissues), to begin again\r\nsimultaneously when in spring the temperature is high enough to\r\nreawaken activity, when the stored food of last year is dissolved\r\nand started on its voyage. The exact manner in which this movement of\r\nwater upward and food materials downward takes place, and the forces\r\nat work, are not yet fully understood, nor is there absolute certainty\r\nas to the parts of the tree in which the movement takes place. It\r\nappears, however, that while all the so-called \"sapwood\" is capable\r\nof conducting water (the heartwood is probably not), the most active\r\nmovement of both water and food materials takes place in the cambium\r\n(the growing cells immediately beneath the bark) and youngest parts of\r\nthe bark.\r\n\r\nThe deductions from these processes important to the planter are:\r\nThat injury to the living bark or bast means injury to growth, if not\r\ndestruction to life; that during the period of vegetation transplanting\r\ncan be done only with great caution; that the best time to move trees\r\nis in the fall, when the leaves have dropped and the movement of\r\nwater and food materials has mostly ceased, or in spring, before the\r\nmovement begins again, the winter being objectionable only because of\r\nthe difficulty of working the soil and of keeping the roots protected\r\nagainst frost. All things considered, spring planting, before activity\r\nin the tree has begun, is the best, although it is not impossible to\r\nplant at other times.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nLike the wheat or corn plant, the tree seed require as conditions for\r\nsprouting sufficient moisture, warmth, and air. Tree seeds, however,\r\ndiffer from grain in that most of the kinds lose their power of\r\ngermination easily; with few exceptions (locust, pine, spruce), they\r\ncan not be kept for any length of time.\r\n\r\nThe first leaves formed often differ essentially in shape from those\r\nof the mature tree, which may cause their being confounded with other\r\nplants, weeds, etc.\r\n\r\nThe little seedlings of many, especially the conifers, are quite\r\ndelicate, and remain very small the first season; they need, therefore,\r\nthe protecting shade of mother trees, or artificial shading, and also\r\nprotection against weeds. The amount of light or shade given requires\r\ncareful regulation for some of them; too much light and heat will kill\r\nthem, and so will too much shade. This accounts for the failure of many\r\nseedlings that spring up in the virgin forest.\r\n\r\nThe planter, then, is required to know the nature and the needs of\r\nthe various kinds of seeds and seedlings, so as to provide favorable\r\nconditions, when he will avoid sowing in the open field such as require\r\nthe care which it is impracticable to give outside of the nursery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Bud development of beech. _B_, as it would be\r\nif all formed buds were to live; _A_, as it is, many buds failing to\r\ndevelop.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH IN LENGTH AND RAMIFICATION.\r\n\r\nWhile the stalk of wheat or corn grows for one season, exhausts\r\nitself in seed production, and then dies, the tree continues to grow\r\nfrom season to season, in length as well as in thickness. The growth\r\nin length of shaft and branches proceeds from buds, made up of cell\r\ntissues, which can subdivide and lengthen into shoots, as well as make\r\nleaves. These buds are formed during summer, and when winter begins\r\ncontain embryo leaves, more or less developed, under the protecting\r\ncover of scales (fig. 3). When spring stimulates the young plant to\r\nnew activity, the buds swell, shed their scales, distend their cells,\r\nincreasing their number by subdivision, and thus the leaves expand, and\r\nthe bud lengthens into a shoot and twig. During the season new buds are\r\nformed, and the whole process repeats itself from year to year, giving\r\nrise to the ramification and height growth of the tree. The end buds\r\nbeing mostly stronger and better developed, the main axis of tree or\r\nbranch increases more rapidly than the rest. All these buds originate\r\nfrom the youngest, central part of the shoot, the pith, and hence\r\nwhen the tree grows in thickness, enveloping the base of the limbs,\r\ntheir connection with the pith can always be traced. This is the usual\r\nmanner of bud formation; in addition, so-called \"adventitious\" buds\r\nmaybe formed from the young living wood in later life, which are not\r\nconnected with the pith. Such buds are those which develop into sprouts\r\nfrom the stump when the tree is cut; also those which give rise to\r\nwhat are known as \"water sprouts.\" Many buds, although formed, are,\r\nhowever, not developed at once, and perhaps not at all, especially as\r\nthe tree grows older; these either die or remain \"dormant,\" often for a\r\nhundred years, to spring into life when necessary (fig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Buds of maple. _A_, longitudinal section\r\nthrough tip of a maple twig; _g_, end bud; _s_, lateral buds; _l_,\r\nscars of leaves of last season. _B_, cross-section through end bud,\r\nshowing folded leaves in center and scales surrounding them.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that each ordinary limb starts as a bud from the pith is an\r\nimportant one to the timber grower; it explains knotty timber and gives\r\nhim the hint that in order to obtain clear timber the branches first\r\nformed must be soon removed, either by the knife or by proper shading,\r\nwhich kills the branches and thus \"clears\" the shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Dormant bud, _K_, on a 12-year old branch of\r\nbeech. The bud is still capable of development and is connected with\r\nthe pith, _mm_, of the stem by a line trace of pith, _S_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Section through a 12-year old stem of beech,\r\nshowing manner of bud and limb formation, _a_, dormant buds; _b_, their\r\ntrace of pith extending to the pith of the stem; _c_, a limb which\r\nstarted two years ago from a dormant bud; _d_, normal limb; _e_, a limb\r\ndead for four years; _f_, adventitious buds.]\r\n\r\nThe planter has it also in his power to influence the form development\r\nof the tree by removing some of the buds, giving thereby better chance\r\nto the remaining ones. This pruning of buds is, where practicable,\r\noften better practice than the pruning of limbs.\r\n\r\nSince the tree does not grow in length except by its buds it is evident\r\nthat a limb which started to grow at the height of 6 feet has its base\r\nalways 6 feet from the ground, and if allowed to grow to size, must be\r\nsurrounded by the wood which accumulates on the main stem or trunk. If\r\na limb is killed and broken off early, only a slender stub composed\r\nentirely of rapidly decaying sapwood, is left, occasioning, therefore,\r\nonly a small defect in the heart of the tree; but if left to grow to\r\nconsiderable age, the base of the limb is encased by the wood of the\r\nstem, which, when the tree is cut into lumber, appears as a knot. The\r\nlonger the limb has been allowed to grow, the farther out is the timber\r\nknotty and the thicker is the knot. If the limb remained alive, the\r\nknot is \"sound,\" closely grown together with the fibers of the tree.\r\nIf the limb died off, the remaining stub may behave in different ways.\r\nIn pines it will be largely composed of heartwood, very resinous and\r\ndurable; separated from the fibers of the overgrowing wood, it forms a\r\n\"loose\" knot, which is apt to fall out of a board, leaving a hole.\r\n\r\nIn broad-leaved trees, where no resin assists in the process of\r\nhealing, the stub is apt to decay, and this decay, caused by the\r\ngrowth of fungi, is apt to penetrate into the tree (fig. 6). In parks\r\nand orchards, pruning is resorted to, and the cuts are painted or\r\ntarred to avoid the decay. In well-managed forests and dense woods\r\nin general, the light is cut off, the limb is killed when young and\r\nbreaks away, the shaft \"clears itself,\" and the sound trunk furnishes\r\na good grade of material. The difference in development of the branch\r\nsystem, whether in full enjoyment of light, in open stand, or with the\r\nside light cut off, in dense position, is shown in the accompanying\r\nillustration (fig. 7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Section through partly decayed knot in\r\noak wood. _a_, wood of knot; _b_ and _c_, wood callus of the stem\r\ncovering the wound; shaded portion, decayed wood, black part, a cavity\r\nremaining.]\r\n\r\nBoth trees start alike; the one retains its branches, the other loses\r\nthem gradually, the stubs being in time overgrown; finally the second\r\nhas a clear shaft, with a crown concentrated at the top, while the\r\nfirst is beset with branches and branch stubs for its whole length\r\n(fig. 8).\r\n\r\nWhen ripped open lengthwise, the interior exhibits the condition shown\r\nin figure 9, the dead parts of the knot being indicated in heavier\r\nshading. Since the brandies grow in more or less regular whorls,\r\nseveral knots, stumps, or limbs are met every 6 to 24 inches through\r\nthe entire stem.\r\n\r\nHence, in forest planting, trees are placed and kept for some time\r\nclose together, in order to decrease the branching in the lower part of\r\nthe tree and thus produce a clean bole and clear lumber.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH IN THICKNESS.\r\n\r\nThe young seedling and the young shoot of the older tree much resemble\r\nin interior structure that of any herbaceous plant, being composed of a\r\nlarge amount of pith, loose squarish cells, and a few bundles of long\r\nfibers symmetrically distributed about the center, the whole covered\r\nwith a thin skin or epidermis. Each strand or bundle of fibers, called\r\nfibro-vascular (fiber-vessel) bundles, consists of two kinds, namely,\r\nwood fibers on the inner side and bast fibers of different structure\r\non the outer side. Between these two sets of fibers, the bast and the\r\nwood, there is a row of cells which form the really active, growing\r\npart of the plantlet, the cambium. The cambium cells are actively\r\nsubdividing and expanding, giving off wood cells to the interior and\r\nbast cells to the exterior, and extending at the same time side-wise,\r\nuntil at the end of the season not only are the wood and bast portions\r\nincreased in lines radiating from the center, but the cambium layer,\r\nthe wood cells, and the bast cells of all the bundles (scattered at\r\nthe beginning) join at the sides to form a complete ring, or rather\r\nhollow cylinder, around the central pith. Only here and there the pith\r\ncells remain, interrupting the wood cylinder and giving rise to the\r\nsystem of cells known as medullary rays. The cross-section now shows a\r\ncomparatively small amount of pith and bast or bark and a larger body\r\nof strong wood fibers. The new shoot at the end, to be sure, has the\r\nsame appearance and arrangement as the young plantlet had, the pith\r\npreponderating, and the continuous cylinder of cambium, bast, and wood\r\nbeing separated into strands or bundles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Development in and out of the forest. _A_,\r\nyoung tree alike. In both cases; _B_ and _C_, successive stages of tree\r\ngrown in the open; _B´_ and _C´_, corresponding stages of the tree\r\ngrown in the forest. Numbers refer to annual growth in height.]\r\n\r\nDuring the season, through the activity of the cambial part of the\r\nbundles, the same changes take place in the new shoot as did the\r\nprevious year in the young seedling, while at the same time the cambium\r\nin the yearling part also actively subdivides, forming new wood and\r\nbast cells, and thus a second ring, or rather cylinder, is formed. The\r\ncambium of the young shoot is always a continuation of that of the ring\r\nor cylinder formed the year before, and this cambium cylinder always\r\nkeeps moving outward, so that at the end of the season, when activity\r\nceases, it is always the last minute layer of cells on the outside of\r\nthe wood, between wood proper and bark. It is here, therefore, that\r\nthe life of the tree lies, and any injury to the cambium must interfere\r\nwith the growth and life of the tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Tree in and out of the forest. _D_, tree grown\r\nin the open; _D´_, tree grown in the forest.]\r\n\r\nThe first wood cells which the cambium forms in the spring are usually\r\nor always of a more open structure, thin-walled, and with a large\r\nopening or \"lumen,\" comparable to a blown-up paper bag; so large, in\r\nfact, sometimes, is the \"lumen\" that the width of the cells can be\r\nseen on a cross-section with the naked eye, as, for instance, in oak,\r\nash, elm, the so-called \"pores\" are this open wood formed in spring.\r\nThe cells, which are formed later in summer, have mostly thick walls,\r\nare closely crowded and compressed, and show a very small opening or\r\n\"lumen,\" being comparable, perhaps, to a very thick wooden box. They\r\nappear in the cross-section not only denser but of a deeper color, on\r\naccount of their crowded, compressed condition and thicker walls. Since\r\nat the beginning of the next season again thin-walled cells with wide\r\nopenings or lumina are formed, this difference in the appearance of\r\n\"spring wood\" and \"summer wood\" enables us to distinguish the layer of\r\nwood formed each year. This \"annual ring\" is more conspicuous in Some\r\nkinds than in others. In the so-called \"ring porous\" woods, like oak,\r\nash, elm, the rings are easily distinguished by the open spring wood;\r\nin the conifers, especially pines, by the dark-colored summer wood;\r\nwhile in maple, birch, tulip, etc., only a thin line of flattened,\r\nhence darker and regularly aligned, summer cells, often hardly\r\nrecognizable, distinguishes The rings from each other. Cutting through\r\na tree, therefore, we can not only ascertain its age by counting its\r\nannual layers in the cross-section, but also determine how much wood is\r\nformed each year (fig. 10). We can, in fact, retrace the history of\r\nits growth, the vicissitudes through which it has passed, by the record\r\npreserved in its ring growth.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the age of a tree correctly, however, we must cut so near\r\nto the ground as to include the growth of the first year's little\r\nplantlet; any section higher up shows as many years too few as it took\r\nthe tree to reach that height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Sections of logs showing the relative\r\ndevelopment of knots. _E_, from tree grown in the open; _E´_, from tree\r\ngrown in a dense forest; _a_ and _c_, whorls of knots; _b_, dead limb;\r\n_sk_, \"sound knot;\" _dk_, \"dead knot.\"]\r\n\r\nThis annual-ring formation is the rule in all countries which have\r\ndistinct seasons of summer and winter and temporary cessation of\r\ngrowth. Only exceptionally a tree may fail to make its growth\r\nthroughout its whole length on account of loss of foliage or other\r\ncauses; and occasionally, when its growth has been disturbed during\r\nthe season, a \"secondary\" ring, resembling the annual ring, and\r\ndistinguishable only by the expert, may appear and mar the record.\r\n\r\nTo the forest planter this chapter on ring growth is of great\r\nimportance, because not only does this feature of tree life afford the\r\nmeans of watching the progress of his crop, calculating the amount of\r\nwood formed, and therefrom determining when it is most profitable for\r\nhim to harvest (namely, when the annual or periodic wood growth falls\r\nbelow a certain amount), but since the proportion of summer wood and\r\nspring wood determines largely the quality of the timber, and since he\r\nhas it in his power to influence the preponderance of the one or other\r\nby adaptation of species to soils and by their management, ring growth\r\nfurnishes an index for regulating the quality of his crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORM DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nIf a tree is allowed to grow in the open, it has a tendency to branch,\r\nand makes a low and spreading crown. In order to lengthen its shaft and\r\nto reduce the number of branches it is necessary to narrow its growing\r\nspace, to shade its sides so that the lower branches and their foliage\r\ndo not receive light enough to perform their functions. When the side\r\nshade is dense enough, these branches die and finally break off under\r\nthe influence of winds and fungous growth; wood then forms over the\r\nscars and we get a clean shaft which carries a crown high up beyond the\r\nreach of shade from neighbors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Scheme to Illustrate the arrangement of annual\r\ngrowth. 1, 2, 3, etc., represent the parts of the stem grown during the\r\nfirst, second, third, etc., twenty years of the life of the tree, _k_,\r\nknots; the shaded part of each is the \"dead knot\" of lumber.]\r\n\r\nThe branches being prevented from spreading out, the shaft is forced\r\nto grow upward, and hence, when crowded by others, trees become taller\r\nand more cylindrical in form, while in the open, where they can spread,\r\nthey remain lower and more conical in form (figs. 11, 12).\r\n\r\nThere are, to be sure, different natural types of development, some,\r\nlike the walnuts, oaks, beeches, and the broad-leaved trees generally,\r\nhaving greater tendency to spread than others, like spruces, firs,\r\nand conifers in general, which lengthen their shaft in preference\r\nto spreading, even in the open. This tendency to spreading is also\r\ninfluenced by soil conditions and climate, as well as by the age of the\r\ntree. When the trees cease to grow in height, their crowns broaden, and\r\nthis takes place sooner in shallow soils than in deep, moist ones; but\r\nthe tendency can be checked and all can be made to develop the shaft at\r\nthe expense of the branches by proper shading from the sides.\r\n\r\nIt follows that the forest planter, who desires to produce long and\r\nclean shafts and best working quality of timber, must secure and\r\nmaintain side shade by a close stand, while the landscape gardener,\r\nwho desires characteristic form, must maintain an open stand and full\r\nenjoyment of light for his trees.\r\n\r\nNow, as we have seen, different species afford different amounts of\r\nshade, and in proportion to the shade which they afford can they\r\nendure shade. The beech or sugar maple or spruce, which maintain a\r\nlarge amount of foliage under the dense shade of their own crown, show\r\nthat their leaves can live and functionate with a small amount of\r\nlight. They are shade-enduring trees. On the other hand, the black\r\nwalnut, the locust, the catalpa, the poplars, and the larch show by the\r\nmanner in which their crowns thin out, the foliage being confined to\r\nthe ends of the branches, that their leaves require more light--they\r\nare light-needing trees; so that the scale which arranges the trees\r\naccording to the amount of shade they exert serves also to measure\r\ntheir shade endurance.\r\n\r\nIn making, therefore, mixed plantations, the different kinds must be so\r\ngrouped and managed that the shady trees will not outgrow and overtop\r\nthe light-needing; the latter must either have the start of the former\r\nor must be quicker growers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Oak tree grown in the open.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Maple tree grown in the forest.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRATE OF GROWTH.\r\n\r\nNot only do different species grow more or less rapidly in height and\r\ngirth, but there is in each species a difference in the rate of growth\r\nduring different periods of life, and a difference in the persistence\r\nof growth.\r\n\r\nIt stands to reason that trees grow differently in different soils and\r\nsituations, and hence we can not compare different species with respect\r\nto their rate of growth except as they grow under the same conditions.\r\n\r\nThus the black walnut may grow as fast as or faster than the ash on\r\na rich, deep, moist, warm soil, but will soon fall to the rear in a\r\nwetter, colder, and shallower soil.\r\n\r\nGiven the same conditions, some species will start on a rapid upward\r\ngrowth at once, like the poplars, aspen, locust, and silver maple,\r\nmaking rapid progress (the most rapid from their tenth to their\r\nfifteenth year), but decreasing soon in rate and reaching their maximum\r\nheight early. Others, like the spruce, beech, and sugar maple, will\r\nbegin slowly, often occupying several, sometimes as many as 10 to\r\n15, years before they appear to grow at all, their energy all going\r\ninto root growth. Then comes a period of more and more accelerated\r\ngrowth, which reaches its maximum rate at 25 or 30 years; and when the\r\ncottonwood or aspen has reached the end of its growth in height the\r\nspruce or pine is still at its best rate, and continues to grow for a\r\nlong time at that rate; in later life the rate decreases, yet height\r\ngrowth sometimes does not cease altogether for centuries. As a rule,\r\nthe light-needing species are the ones which show the rapid height\r\ngrowth at the start, while the shade-enduring are slow at the start,\r\nbut persistent growers.\r\n\r\nThis fact is important in explaining the alternations of forest\r\ngrowth in nature; the persistent shade-enduring species crowd out the\r\nlight-needing, and the latter rapidly take possession of any openings\r\nthat fire or storm has made. It is also important with reference to\r\nthe management of wood crops and starting of mixed plantations; the\r\nlight-needing species must be mixed only with such shade-enduring\r\nspecies as are slower growers than themselves.\r\n\r\nThe diameter growth shows also periodic changes in its rate, and is,\r\nof course, influenced in the same way by soil, climate, and light\r\nconditions, as the height growth.\r\n\r\nIn the juvenile or brush stage, lasting 6 to 10 years in light-needing\r\nand 20 to 40 years in shade-enduring species, the diameter grows\r\ncomparatively little, all energy being directed to height growth and\r\nroot growth. When the crown has been definitely formed, more food\r\nmaterial is available for wood formation, and the increase in foliage\r\nis accompanied by a more rapid increase of trunk diameter; in favorable\r\nsituations, the highest rate occurs between the fortieth and sixtieth\r\nyears; in the poorer situations, between the fiftieth and eightieth\r\nyears, which rate continues for some time. Then comes a period of\r\nslower rate, which finally in old age dwindles down almost to zero.\r\n\r\nBut neither the diameter growth nor the width of the annual rings alone\r\ntells us directly what amount of wood is forming. The outer rings,\r\nbeing laid over a larger circumference, although thinner than the\r\npreceding rings, may yet have greater cubic contents. The statements\r\nof diameter growth are, therefore, misleading if we are interested in\r\nknowing how much wood is forming.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the growth in volume must be considered separately, as\r\ndetermined by the enlargement of the cross-section area and the height.\r\nThe growth in volume or mass accretion is quite small in young trees,\r\nso that when wood is cut young the smallest amount of crop per year\r\nis harvested, while, if it is allowed to grow, an increase more than\r\nproportionate to the number of years may be obtained.\r\n\r\nOnly when the tree has a fully developed crown does it begin to make\r\nmuch wood. Its volume growth progresses then at a uniform rate, and\r\ncontinues to do so for decades, and sometimes for a century or more.\r\n\r\nOn poorer sites the rate is slower, but remains longer on the increase,\r\nwhile on good sites the maximum rate is soon reached.\r\n\r\nOf course, in a forest, where light conditions are not most favorable,\r\nbecause form development and soil conditions require shade, the total\r\nwood formation is less than in an isolated tree, favorably placed.\r\nJust so the dominant trees in a forest--i. e., those which have their\r\ncrowns above all others--show, of course, the advantage they have\r\nover the inferior trees which are suffering from the shade of their\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we would take into consideration an entire forest growth,\r\nand determine, for instance, how much wood an acre of such forest\r\nproduces at different periods, we must not overlook the fact that the\r\nnumber of trees per acre changes as the trees grow older. Some of them\r\nare overshaded and crowded out by the others, so that a young growth of\r\nspruce might start with 100,000 little seedlings to the acre, of which\r\nin the twentieth year only 10,000 would be alive, while in the fortieth\r\nyear the number would be reduced to 1,200, and in the hundredth year to\r\n280. Hence the rate of growth of any single tree gives no idea of what\r\nthe acre of forest will do.\r\n\r\nTims, while a single good white pine might grow the fastest in volume\r\nwhen about one hundred years old, then making wood at the rate of,\r\nsay, 1.5 cubic feet per year, an acre of pine on good soil, containing\r\nabout 1,600 trees, may make the most wood in the thirtieth year, then\r\ngrowing at the rate of 170 cubic feet per acre, while in the hundredth\r\nyear the rate would not exceed 70 cubic feet; and an acre of pine in a\r\npoorer location, with about 1,400 trees, may make the most wood in the\r\nfortieth year, at the rate of 100 cubic feet per acre.\r\n\r\nFrom the consideration of the relation of light conditions to soil\r\nconditions, to form development, and to rate of growth, we may make the\r\nfollowing deductions of interest to the forest planter:\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the best results in wood production, in quantity\r\nand quality, at the same time preserving favorable soil conditions,\r\nthe forest should be composed of various species, a mixture of\r\nlight-needing and shade-enduring kinds. The light-needing ones should\r\nbe of quicker growth; the shady ones, in larger numbers, should\r\nbe slower growers. For the first fifteen to twenty-five years the\r\nplantation should be kept as dense as possible, to secure clear shafts\r\nand good growth in height; then it should be thinned, to increase crown\r\ndevelopment and diameter growth; the thinning, however, is not to be so\r\nsevere that the crowns can not close up again in two or three years;\r\nthe thinning is to be repeated again and again, always favoring the\r\nbest developed trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nAll trees reproduce themselves naturally from seed. Man can secure\r\ntheir reproduction also from cuttings or layers; and some kinds can\r\nreproduce themselves by shoots from the stump when the parent tree has\r\nbeen cut. This latter capacity is possessed in a varying degree by\r\ndifferent species; chestnuts, oaks, elms, maples, poplars, and willows\r\nare most excellent sprouters; most conifers do not sprout at all, and\r\nthe shoots of those that do sprout soon die (Sequoia or California\r\nredwood seems to be an exception). Sprouts of broad-leaved trees\r\ndevelop differently from seedlings, growing very rapidly at first, but\r\nsoon lessening in the rate of growth and never attaining the height and\r\nperhaps not the diameter of trees grown from the seed; they are also\r\nshorter lived. With age the stumps lose their capacity for sprouting.\r\nTo secure best results, the parent tree should be cut close to the\r\nground in early spring, avoiding severe frost, and a sharp cut should\r\nbe made which will not sever the bark from the trunk.\r\n\r\nNot all trees bear seed every year, and plentiful seed production,\r\nespecially in a forest, occurs, as a rule, periodically. The periods\r\ndiffer with species, climate, and season.\r\n\r\nNot all seeds can germinate, and in some species the number of seeds\r\nthat can germinate is very small, and they lose their power of\r\ngermination when kept a few hours, like the willows. Others, if kept\r\ntill they have become dry, will \"lie over\" in the soil a year or more\r\nbefore germinating. The same thing will occur if they are covered too\r\ndeep in the soil, provided they germinate at all under such conditions.\r\n\r\nIn order to germinate, seeds must have warmth, air, and moisture.\r\nThe preparation of a seed bed is, therefore, necessary in order to\r\nsupply these conditions in most favorable combination. In the natural\r\nforest millions of seeds rot or dry without sprouting, and millions\r\nof seedlings sprout, but soon perish under the too dense shade of the\r\nmother trees.\r\n\r\nMan, desiring to reproduce a valuable wood crop, cannot afford to be\r\nas lavish as nature, and must therefore improve upon nature's methods,\r\nmaking more careful preparation for the production of his crop, either\r\nby growing the seedlings in nurseries and transplanting them, or else\r\nby cutting away the old growth in such a manner as to secure to the\r\nyoung self-grown crop better chances for life and development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. HOW TO PLANT A FOREST.\r\n\r\n\r\nForest planting and tree planting are two different things. The\r\norchardist, who plants for fruit; the landscape gardener, who plants\r\nfor form; the roadside planter, who plants for shade, all have objects\r\nin view different from that of the forest planter, and therefore\r\nselect and use their plant material differently. They deal with single\r\nindividual trees, each one by itself destined for a definite purpose.\r\nThe forester, on the other hand, plants a crop like the farmer; he\r\ndeals not with the single seed or plant, but with masses of trees; the\r\nindividual tree has value to him only as apart of the whole. It may\r\ncome to harvest for its timber, or it may not come to harvest, and yet\r\nhave answered its purpose as a part of the whole in shading the ground,\r\nor acting as nurse or \"forwarder\" as long as it was necessary.\r\n\r\nHis object is not to grow trees, but to produce wood, the largest\r\namount of the best quality per acre, whether it be stored in one tree\r\nor in many, and his methods must be directed to that end.\r\n\r\nAs far as the manner of setting out plants or sowing seeds is\r\nconcerned, the same general principles and the same care in\r\nmanipulation are applicable as in any other planting, except as the\r\ncoat of operating on so Large a scale may necessitate less careful\r\nmethods than the gardener or nurseryman can afford to apply; the\r\nnearer, however, the performance of planting can be brought to the\r\ncareful manner of the gardener, the surer the success. The principles\r\nunderlying such methods have been discussed in the chapter \"How trees\r\ngrow;\" in the present chapter it is proposed to point out briefly\r\nthe special considerations which should guide the forest planter in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT TREES TO PLANT.\r\n\r\n_Adaptability to climate_ is the first requisite in the species to be\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\nIt is best to choose from the native growth of the region which is\r\nknown to be adapted to it. With regard to species not native, the\r\nreliance must be placed upon the experience of neighboring planters\r\nand upon experiment (at first on a small scale), after study of the\r\nrequirements of the kinds proposed for trial.\r\n\r\nAdaptation must be studied, not only with reference to temperature\r\nranges and rainfall, but especially with reference to atmospheric\r\nhumidity and requirements of transpiration.\r\n\r\nMany species have a wide range of natural distribution, and hence\r\nof climatic adaptation. If such are to be used, it is important to\r\nsecure seeds from that part of the range of natural distribution where\r\nthe plants must be hardiest, i. e., the coldest and driest region in\r\nwhich it occurs, which insures hardy qualities in the offspring. For\r\ninstance, the Douglas spruce from the humid and evenly tempered Pacific\r\nSlope will not be as hardy as that grown from seed collected on the dry\r\nand frigid slopes of the Rockies. Lack of attention to this requisite\r\naccounts for many failures. It must also be kept in mind that, while\r\na species may be able to grow in another than its native climate, its\r\nwood may not there have the same valuable qualities which it develops\r\nin its native habitat.\r\n\r\n_Adaptability to soil_ must be studied less with reference to mineral\r\nconstituents than to physical condition. Depth and moisture conditions,\r\nand the structure of the soil, which influences the movement of water\r\nin it, are the most important elements. While all trees thrive best\r\nin a moist to \"fresh\" soil of moderate depth (from 2 to 4 feet) and\r\ngranular structure, some can adapt themselves to drier or wetter,\r\nshallow, and compact soils. Fissures in rocks into which the roots can\r\npenetrate often stand for depth of soil, and usually aid in maintaining\r\nfavorable moisture conditions. In soils of great depth (i. e., from the\r\nsurface to the impenetrable subsoil) and of coarse structure water may\r\ndrain away so fast as not to be available to the roots.\r\n\r\nSoil moisture must always be studied in conjunction with atmospheric\r\nmoisture; for, while a species may thrive in an arid soil, when the\r\ndemands of transpiration are not great, it may not do so when aridity\r\nof atmosphere is added. Trees of the swamp are apt to be indifferent to\r\nsoil moisture and to thrive quite well, if not better, in drier soils.\r\n\r\n_Adaptability to site._--While a species may be well adapted to the\r\ngeneral climatic conditions of a region, and in general to the soil,\r\nthere still remains to be considered its adaptability to the particular\r\n\"site,\" under which term we may comprise the total effect of general\r\nclimate, local climate, and soil. The general climatic conditions are\r\nlocally influenced, especially by the slope, exposure, or aspect, and\r\nthe surroundings. Thus we know that eastern exposures are more liable\r\nto frost, western exposures more liable to damage from winds, southern\r\nmore apt to be hot and to dry out, and northern to be cooler and\r\ndamper, having in consequence a shorter period of vegetation. Hollows\r\nand lowlands are more exposed to frosts and more subject to variations\r\nin soil moisture, etc.\r\n\r\nHence for these various situations it is advisable to select species\r\nwhich can best withstand such local dangers.\r\n\r\n_The use value, or utility_, of the species is next to be considered.\r\nThis must be done with reference to the commercial and domestic demand,\r\nand the length of time it takes the species to attain its value. The\r\ngreater variety of purposes a wood may serve--i. e., the greater its\r\ngeneral utility--and the sooner it attains its use value the better.\r\nWhite pine for the northeastern States as a wood is like the apple\r\namong fruits, making an all-round useful material in large quantities\r\nper acre in short time. Tulip poplar, applicable to a wider climatic\r\nrange, is almost as valuable, while oak, ash, and hickory are standard\r\nwoods in the market. Other woods are of limited application. Thus the\r\nblack locust, which grows most quickly into useful posts, has only a\r\nlimited market, much more limited than it should have; hickory soon\r\nfurnishes valuable hoop poles from the thinnings, and later the best\r\nwagon material, not, however, large quantities in a short time; while\r\nblack walnut of good quality is very high in price, the market is also\r\nlimited, and the dark color of the heartwood, for which it is prized,\r\nis attained only by old trees. The black cherry, used for similar\r\npurposes, attains its value much sooner.\r\n\r\nBy planting various species together, variety of usefulness may be\r\nsecured and the certainty of a market increased.\r\n\r\n_The forest value_ of the species is only in part expressed by its use\r\nvalue. As has been shown in another place, the composition of the crop\r\nmust be such as to insure maintenance of favorable soil conditions,\r\nas well as satisfactory development of the crop itself. Some species,\r\nalthough of high use value, like ash, oak, etc, are poor preservers of\r\nsoil conditions, allowing grass and weeds to enter the plantation and\r\nto deteriorate the soil under their thin foliage. Others, like beech,\r\nsugar maple, box elder, etc., although of less use value, being dense\r\nfoliaged and preserving a shady crown for a long time, are of great\r\nforest value as soil improvers.\r\n\r\nAgain, as the value of logs depends largely on their freedom from\r\nknots, straightness, and length, it is of importance to secure these\r\nqualities. Some valuable species, if grown by themselves, make crooked\r\ntrunks, do not clean their shafts of branches, and are apt to spread\r\nrather than lengthen. If planted in close companionship with others,\r\nthey are forced by these \"nurses or forwarders\" to make better growths\r\nand clean their shafts of branches.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, from financial considerations, it is well to know that\r\nsome species develop more rapidly and produce larger quantities of\r\nuseful material per acre than others; thus the white pine is a \"big\r\ncropper,\" and, combining with this a tolerably good shading quality,\r\nand being in addition capable of easy reproduction, it is of highest\r\n\"forest value.\"\r\n\r\nHence, as the object of forestry is to make money from continued wood\r\ncrops, use value and forest value must both be considered in The\r\nselection of materials for forest planting.\r\n\r\n_Mutual relationship of different species_, with reference especially\r\nto their relative height growth and their relative light requirements,\r\nmust be considered in starting a mixed plantation.\r\n\r\nMixed forest plantations (made of several kinds) have so many\r\nadvantages over pure plantations (made of one kind) that they should\r\nbe preferred, except for very particular reasons. Mixed plantations\r\nare capable of producing larger quantities of better and more varied\r\nmaterial, preserve soil conditions hotter, are less liable to damage\r\nfrom winds, fires, and insects, and can be more readily reproduced.\r\n\r\nThe following general rules should guide in making up the composition\r\nof a mixed plantation:\r\n\r\n  _a._ Shade-enduring kinds should form the bulk (five-eighths to\r\n  seven-eighths) of the plantation, except on specially favored\r\n  soils where no deterioration is to be feared from planting only\r\n  light-needing kinds, and in which case those may even be planted by\r\n  themselves.\r\n\r\n  _b._ The light-needing trees should be surrounded by shade-enduring\r\n  of slower growth, so that the former may not be overtopped, but have\r\n  the necessary light and be forced by side shade to straight growth.\r\n\r\n  _c._ Shade-enduring species may be grown in admixture with each\r\n  other when their rate of height growth is about equal, or when the\r\n  slower-growing kind can be protected against the quicker-growing (for\r\n  instance, by planting a larger proportion of the former in groups or\r\n  by cutting back the latter).\r\n\r\n  _d._ The more valuable timber trees which are to form the main crop\r\n  should be so disposed individually, and planted in such numbers among\r\n  the secondary crop or nurse crop, that the latter can be thinned out\r\n  first without disturbing the former.\r\n\r\nWhere a plantation of light-foliaged trees has been made (black walnut,\r\nfor instance), it can be greatly improved by \"under-planting\" densely\r\nwith a shade-enduring kind, which will choke out weed growth, improve\r\nthe soil, and thereby advance the growth of the plantation.\r\n\r\nThe selection and proper combination of species with reference to\r\nthis mutual relationship to each other and to the soil are the most\r\nimportant elements of success.\r\n\r\n_Availability_ of the species also still needs consideration in\r\nthis country; for, although a species may be very well adapted to\r\nthe purpose in hand, it may be too difficult to obtain material\r\nfor planting in quantity or at reasonable prices. While the beech\r\nis one of the best species for shade endurance, and hence for soil\r\ncover, seedlings can not be had as yet in quantity. Western conifers,\r\nalthough promising good material for forest planting, are at present\r\ntoo high priced for general use. Some eastern trees can be secured\r\nreadily--either their seed or seedlings--from the native woods; others\r\nmust be grown in nurseries before they can be placed in the field.\r\n\r\n_Whether to procure seeds or plants_, and if the latter, what kind,\r\ndepends upon a number of considerations. The main crop, that which is\r\nto furnish the better timber, had best be planted with nursery-grown\r\nplants, if of slow-growing kinds, perhaps once transplanted, with\r\nwell-developed root systems, the plants in no case to be more than 2 to\r\n3 years old. The secondary or nurse crop may then be sown or planted\r\nwith younger and less costly material taken from the woods or grown in\r\nseed beds, or else cuttings may be used.\r\n\r\nIn some localities--for instance, the Western plains--the germinating\r\nof seeds in the open field is so uncertain, and the life of the young\r\nseedlings for the first year or two so precarious, that the use of\r\nseeds in the field can not be recommended. In such locations careful\r\nselection and treatment of the planting material according to the\r\nhardships which it must encounter can alone insure success.\r\n\r\nSeedlings from 6 to 12 inches high furnish the best material. The\r\nplanting of large-sized trees is not excluded, but is expensive and\r\nhence often impracticable, besides being less sure of success, since\r\nthe larger-sized tree is apt to lose a greater proportion of its roots\r\nin transplanting.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF PLANTING.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of soil_ is for the purpose of securing a favorable start\r\nfor the young crop; its effects are lost after the first few years.\r\nMost land that is to be devoted to forest planting does not admit of\r\nas careful preparation as for agricultural crops, nor is it necessary\r\nwhere the climate is hot too severe and the soil not too compact to\r\nprevent the young crop from establishing itself. Thousands of acres in\r\nGermany are planted annually without any soil preparation, yearling\r\npine seedlings being set with a dibble in the unprepared ground. This\r\nabsence of preparation is even necessary in sandy soils, like that\r\nencountered in the sand-hills of Nebraska, which may, if disturbed,\r\nbe blown out and shifted. In other cases a partial removal of a too\r\nrank undergrowth or soil cover and a shallow scarifying or hoeing is\r\nresorted to, or else furrows are thrown up and the trees set out in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn land that has been tilled, deep plowing (10 to 12 inches) and\r\nthorough pulverizing give the best chances for the young crop to\r\nstart. For special conditions, very dry or very moist situations,\r\nspecial methods are required. The best methods for planting in the\r\nsemiarid regions of the far West have not yet been developed. Thorough\r\ncultivation, as for agricultural crops, with subsequent culture, is\r\nsuccessful, but expensive. A plan which might be tried would consist in\r\nbreaking the raw prairie in June and turning over a shallow sod, sowing\r\na crop of oats or alfalfa, harvesting it with a high stubble, then\r\nopening furrows for planting and leaving the ground between furrows\r\nundisturbed, so as to secure the largest amount of drainage into the\r\nfurrows and a mulch between the rows.\r\n\r\n_The time for planting_ depends on climatic and soil conditions and\r\nthe convenience of the planter. Spring planting is preferable except\r\nin southern latitudes, especially in the West, where the winters are\r\nsevere and the fall apt to be dry, the soil therefore not in favorable\r\ncondition for planting.\r\n\r\nThe time for fall planting is after the leaves have fallen; for spring\r\nplanting, before or just when life begins anew. In order to be ready in\r\ntime for spring planting, it is a good practice to take up the plants\r\nin the fall and \"heel them in\" over winter (covering them, closely\r\npacked, in a dry trench of soil). Conifers can be planted later in\r\nspring and earlier in fall than broad-leaved trees.\r\n\r\n_The density_ of the trees is a matter in which most planters fail. The\r\nadvantages of close planting lie in the quicker shading of the soil,\r\nhence the better preservation of its moisture and improved growth and\r\nform development of the crop. These advantages must be balanced against\r\nthe increased cost of close planting. The closer the planting, the\r\nsooner will the plantation be self-sustaining and the surer the success.\r\n\r\nIf planted in squares, or, better still, in quincunx order (the trees\r\nin every other row alternating at equal distances), which is most\r\ndesirable on account of the more systematic work possible and the more\r\ncomplete cover which it makes, the distance should not be more than 4\r\nfeet, unless for special reasons and conditions, while 2 feet apart is\r\nnot too close, and still closer planting is done by nature with the\r\nbest success.\r\n\r\nThe following numbers of trees per acre are required when planting at\r\ndistances as indicated:\r\n\r\n  1½ by 1½ feet  19,360  |  2 by 4 feet    6,445\r\n  1½ by 2 feet   14,520  |  3 by 3 feet    4,840\r\n  2  by 2 foot   10,890  |  3 by 4 feet    3,630\r\n  2  by 3 feet    7,260  |  4 by 4 feet    2,722\r\n\r\nTo decrease expense, the bulk of the plantation may be made of the\r\ncheapest kinds of trees that may serve as soil cover and secondary or\r\nnurse crop, the main crop of from 300 to 600 trees to consist of better\r\nkinds, and with better planting material, mainly of light-needing\r\nspecies. These should be evenly disposed through the plantation, each\r\nclosely surrounded by the nurse crop. It is, of course, understood that\r\nnot all trees grow up; a constant change in numbers by the death (or\r\nelse timely removal) of the overshaded takes place, so that the final\r\ncrop shows at 100 years a close cover, with hardly 300 trees to the\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n_After-culture_ is not entirely avoidable, especially under unfavorable\r\nclimatic conditions, and if the planting was not close enough. Shallow\r\ncultivation between the rows is needed to prevent weed growth and to\r\nkeep the soil open, until it is shaded by the young trees, which may\r\ntake a year with close planting and two or three years with rows 4 by 4\r\nfeet apart, the time varying also with the species.\r\n\r\nIt is rare that a plantation succeeds in all its parts; gaps or fail\r\nplaces occur, as a rule, and must be filled in by additional planting\r\nas soon as possible, if of larger extent than can be closed up in a few\r\nyears by the neighboring growth.\r\n\r\nWhen the soil is protected by a complete leaf canopy, the forest crop\r\nmay be considered as established, and the after-treatment will consist\r\nof judicious thinning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. HOW TO TREAT THE WOOD LOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the northeastern States it is the custom to have connected with\r\nthe farm apiece of virgin woodland, commonly called the wood lot. Its\r\nobject primarily is to supply the farmer with the firewood, fence\r\nmaterial, and such dimension timbers as he may need from time to time\r\nfor repairs on buildings, wagons, etc.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the wood lot occupies, as it ought to, the poorer part of\r\nthe farm, the rocky or stony, the dry or the wet portions, which are\r\nnot well fitted for agricultural crops. As a rule, it is treated as\r\nit ought not to be, if the intention is to have it serve its purpose\r\ncontinuously; it is cut and culled without regard to its reproduction.\r\n\r\nAs far as firewood supplies go, the careful farmer will first use\r\nthe dead and dying trees, broken limbs, and leavings, which is quite\r\nproper. The careless man avoids the extra labor which such material\r\nrequires, and takes whatever splits best, no matter whether the\r\nmaterial could be used for better purposes or not.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the cutting of other material, fence rails, posts, or\r\ndimension timber, the general rule is to go into the lot and select\r\nthe best trees of the best kind for the purpose. This looks at first\r\nsight like the natural, most practical way of doing. It is the method\r\nwhich the lumberman pursues when he \"culls\" the forest, and is, from\r\nhis point of view perhaps, justifiable, for he only desires to secure\r\nat once what is most profitable in the forest. But for the farmer, who\r\nproposes to use his wood lot continuously for supplies of this kind, it\r\nis a method detrimental to his object, and in time it leaves him with a\r\nlot of poor, useless timber which encumbers the ground and prevents the\r\ngrowth of a better crop.\r\n\r\nOur woods are mostly composed of many species of trees; they are mixed\r\nwoods. Some of the species are valuable for some special purposes,\r\nothers are applicable to a variety of purposes, and again others\r\nfurnish but poor material for anything but firewood, and even for that\r\nuse they may not be of the best.\r\n\r\nAmong the most valuable in the northeastern woods we should mention\r\nthe white pine--king of all--the white ash, white and chestnut oak,\r\nhickories, tulip tree, black walnut, and black cherry, the last three\r\nbeing now nearly exhausted; next, spruce and hemlock, red pine, sugar\r\nmaple, chestnut, various oaks of the black or red oak tribe, several\r\nspecies of ash and birch, black locust; lastly, elms and soft maples,\r\nbasswood, poplars, and sycamore.\r\n\r\nNow, by the common practice of culling the best it is evident that\r\ngradually all the best trees of the best kinds are taken out, leaving\r\nonly inferior trees or inferior kinds--the weeds among trees, if one\r\nmay call them such--and thus the wood lot becomes well-nigh useless.\r\n\r\nIt does not supply that for which it was intended; the soil, which was\r\nof little use for anything but a timber crop before, is still further\r\ndeteriorated under this treatment, and being compacted by the constant\r\nrunning of cattle, the starting of a crop of seedlings is made nearly\r\nimpossible. It would not pay to turn it into tillage ground or pasture;\r\nthe farm has by so much lost in value. In other words, instead of using\r\nthe interest on his capital, interest and capital have been used up\r\ntogether; the goose that laid the golden egg has been killed.\r\n\r\nThis is not necessary if only a little system is brought into the\r\nmanagement of the wood lot and the smallest care is taken to avoid\r\ndeterioration and secure reproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT CUTTINGS.\r\n\r\nThe first care should be to improve the crop in its composition.\r\nInstead of culling it of its best material, it should be culled of its\r\nweeds, the poor kinds, which we do not care to reproduce, and which,\r\nlike all other weeds, propagate themselves only too readily. This\r\nweeding must not, however, be done all sit once, as it could be in\r\na field crop, for in a full-grown piece of woodland each tree has a\r\nvalue, even the weed trees, as soil cover.\r\n\r\nThe great secret of success in all crop production lies in the\r\nregulating of water supplies; the manuring in part and the cultivating\r\nentirely, as well as drainage and irrigation, are means to this end. In\r\nforestry these means are usually not practicable, and hence other means\r\nare resorted to. The principal of these is to keep the soil as much as\r\npossible under cover, either by the shade which the foliage of the tall\r\ntrees furnishes, or by that from the underbrush, or by the litter which\r\naccumulates and in decaying forms a humus cover, a most excellent mulch.\r\n\r\nA combination of these three conditions, viz, a dense crown cover,\r\nwoody underbrush where the crown cover is interrupted, and a heavy\r\nlayer of well-decomposed humus, gives the best result. Under such\r\nconditions, first of all, the rain, being intercepted by the foliage\r\nand litter, reaches the ground only gradually, and therefore does not\r\ncompact the soil as it does in the open field, but leaves it granular\r\nand open, so that the water can readily penetrate and move in the soil.\r\nSecondly, the surface evaporation is considerably reduced by the shade\r\nand lack of air circulation in the dense woods, be that more moisture\r\nremains for the use of the trees. When the shade of the crowns overhead\r\n(the so-called \"crown cover,\" or \"canopy,\") is perfect, but little\r\nundergrowth will be seen; but where the crown cover is interrupted\r\nor imperfect, an undergrowth will appear. If this is composed of\r\nyoung trees, or even shrubs, it is an advantage, but if of weeds, and\r\nespecially grass, it is a misfortune, because these transpire a great\r\ndeal more water than the woody plants and allow the soil to deteriorate\r\nin structure and therefore in water capacity.\r\n\r\nSome weeds and grasses, to be sure, are capable of existing where but\r\nlittle light reaches the soil. When they appear it is a sign to the\r\nforester that he must be careful not to thin out the crown cover any\r\nmore. When the more light-needing weeds and grasses appear it is a sign\r\nthat too much light reaches the ground, and that the soil is already\r\ndeteriorated. If this state continues, the heavy drain which the\r\ntranspiration of these weeds makes upon the soil moisture, without any\r\nappreciable conservative action by their shade, will injure the soil\r\nstill further.\r\n\r\nThe overhead shade or crown cover may be imperfect because there are\r\nnot enough trees on the ground to close up the interspaces with their\r\ncrowns, or else because the kinds of trees which make up the forest do\r\nnot yield much shade; thus it can easily be observed that a beech, a\r\nsugar maple, a hemlock, is so densely foliaged that but little light\r\nreaches the soil through its crown canopy, while an ash, an oak, a\r\nlarch, when full grown, in the forest, allows a good deal of light to\r\npenetrate.\r\n\r\nHence, in our weeding process for the improvement of the wood crop,\r\nwe must be careful not to interrupt the crown cover too much, and\r\nthereby deteriorate the soil conditions. And for the same reason, in\r\nthe selection of the kinds that are to be left or to be taken out, we\r\nshall not only consider their use value but also their shading value,\r\ntrying to bring about such a mixture of shady and less shady kinds as\r\nwill insure a continuously satisfactory crown cover, the shade-enduring\r\nkinds to occupy the lower stratum in the crown canopy, and to be more\r\nnumerous than the light-needing.\r\n\r\nThe forester, therefore, watches first the conditions of his soil\r\ncover, and his next care is for the condition of the overhead shade,\r\nthe \"crown cover;\" for a change in the condition of the latter brings\r\nchange into his soil conditions, and, inversely, from the changes\r\nin the plant cover of the soil he judges whether he may or may not\r\nchange the light conditions. The changes of the soil cover teach him\r\nmore often when \"to let alone\" than when to go on with his operations\r\nof thinning out; that is to say, he can rarely stop short of that\r\ncondition which is most favorable. Hence the improvement cuttings must\r\nbe made with caution and only very gradually, so that no deterioration\r\nof the soil conditions be invited. We have repeated this injunction\r\nagain and again, because all success in the management of future wood\r\ncrops depends upon the care bestowed upon the maintenance of favorable\r\nsoil conditions.\r\n\r\nAs the object of this weeding is not only to remove the undesirable\r\nkinds from the present crop, but to prevent as much as possible their\r\nreappearance in subsequent crops, it maybe advisable to cut such kinds\r\nas sprout readily from the stump in summer time--June or July--when the\r\nstumps are, likely to die without sprouting.\r\n\r\nIt may take several years' cutting to bring the composition of the main\r\ncrop into such a condition as to satisfy us.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF REPRODUCING THE WOOD CROP.\r\n\r\nThen comes the period of utilizing the main crop. As we propose to keep\r\nthe wood lot as such, and desire to reproduce a satisfactory wood crop\r\nin place of the old one, this latter must be cut always with a view to\r\nthat reproduction. There are various methods pursued for this purpose\r\nin large forestry operations which are not practicable on small areas,\r\nespecially when these are expected to yield only small amounts of\r\ntimber, and these little by little as required. It is possible, to be\r\nsure, to cut the entire crop and replant a new one, or else to use the\r\nax skillfully and bring about a natural reproduction in a few years;\r\nbut we want in the present case to lengthen out the period during which\r\nthe old crop is cut, and hence must resort to other methods. There are\r\nthree methods practicable.\r\n\r\nWe may clear narrow strips or bands entirely, expecting the neighboring\r\ngrowth to furnish the seed for covering the strip with a new crop--\"the\r\nstrip method;\" or we can take out single trees here and there, relying\r\nagain on an after growth from seed shed by the surrounding trees--the\r\n\"selection method;\" or, finally, instead of single trees, we may cut\r\nentire groups of trees hero and there in the same manner, the gaps to\r\nbe filled, as in the other cases, with a young crop from the seed of\r\nthe surrounding trees, and this we may call the \"group method.\"\r\n\r\nIn _the strip method_, in order to secure sufficient seeding of the\r\ncleared strip, the latter must not be so broad that the seed from the\r\nneighboring growth can not be carried over it by the wind. In order to\r\nget the best results from the carrying power of the wind (as well as to\r\navoid windfalls when the old growth is suddenly opened on the windward\r\nside) the strips should be located on the side opposite the prevailing\r\nwinds. Oaks, beech, hickory, and nut trees in general with heavy seeds\r\nwill not seed over any considerable breadth of strip, while with maple\r\nand ash the breadth may be made twice as great as the height of the\r\ntimber, and the mother trees with lighter seeds, like spruce and pine,\r\nor birch and elm, maybe able to cover strips of a breadth of 3 or 4 and\r\neven 8 times their height. But such broad strips are hazardous, since\r\nwith insufficient seed fall, or fail years in the seed, the strip may\r\nremain exposed to sun and wind for several years without a good cover\r\nand deteriorate. It is safer, therefore, to make the strips no broader\r\nthan just the height of the neighboring timber, in which case not only\r\nhas the seed better chance of covering the ground, but the soil and\r\nseedlings have more protection from the mother crop. In hilly country\r\nthe strips must not be made in the direction of the slope, for the\r\nwater would wash out soil and seed.\r\n\r\nEvery year, then, or from time to time, a new strip is to be cleared\r\nand \"regenerated.\" But if the first strip failed to cover itself\r\nsatisfactorily, the operation is stopped, for it would be unwise to\r\nremove the seed trees further by an additional clearing. Accordingly,\r\nthis method should be used only where the kinds composing the mother\r\ncrop are frequent and abundant seeders and give assurance of reseeding\r\nthe strips quickly and successfully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Showing plan of group system in regenerating\r\na forest crop. 1, 2, 3, 4, successive groups of young timber, 1 being\r\nthe oldest, 4 the youngest, 5 old timber; _a_, wind mantle, specially\r\nmanaged to secure protection.]\r\n\r\nThe other two methods have greater chances of success in that they\r\npreserve the soil conditions more surely, and there is more assurance\r\nof seeding from the neighboring trees on all sides.\r\n\r\n_The selection method_, by which single trees are taken out all over\r\nthe forest, is the same as has been practiced by the farmer and\r\nlumberman hitherto, only they have forgotten to look after the young\r\ncrop. Millions of seed may fall to the ground and germinate, but\r\nperish from the excessive shade of the mother trees. If we wish to be\r\nsuccessful in establishing a new crop, it will be necessary to be ready\r\nwith the ax all the time and give light as needed by the young crop.\r\nThe openings made by taking out single trees are so small that there is\r\ngreat danger of the young crop being lost, or at least impeded in its\r\ndevelopment, because it is impracticable to come in time to its relief\r\nwith the ax.\r\n\r\nThe best method, therefore, in all respects, is the \"_group method_\"\r\nwhich not only secures continuous soil cover, chances for full seeding,\r\nand more satisfactory light conditions, but requires loss careful\r\nattention, or at least permits more freedom of movement and adaptation\r\nto local conditions (fig. 13).\r\n\r\nIt is especially adapted to mixed woods, as it permits securing for\r\neach species the most desirable light conditions by making the openings\r\nlarger or smaller, according as the species we wish to favor in a\r\nparticular group demand more or less shade. Further, when different\r\nspecies are ripe for regeneration at different times, this plan makes\r\nit possible to take them in hand as needed. Again, we can begin with\r\none group or we can take in hand several groups simultaneously, as may\r\nbe desirable and practicable.\r\n\r\nWe start our groups of new crop either where a young growth is already\r\non the ground, enlarging around it, or where old timber has reached\r\nits highest usefulness and should be cut in order that we may not lose\r\nthe larger growth which young trees would make; or else we choose a\r\nplace which is but poorly stocked, where, if it is not regenerated,\r\nthe soil is likely to deteriorate further. The choice is affected\r\nfurther by the consideration that dry situations should be taken in\r\nhand earlier than those in which the soil and site are more favorable,\r\nand that some species reach maturity and highest use value earlier\r\nthan others and should therefore be reproduced earlier. In short, we\r\nbegin the regeneration when and where the necessity for it exists, or\r\nwhere the young crop has the best chance to start most satisfactorily\r\nwith the least artificial aid. Of course, advantage should betaken of\r\nthe occurrence of seed years, which come at different intervals with\r\ndifferent species.\r\n\r\nIf we begin with a group of young growth already on the ground, our\r\nplan is to remove gradually the old trees standing over them when no\r\nlonger required for shade, and then to cut away the adjoining old\r\ngrowth and enlarge the opening in successive narrow bands around the\r\nyoung growth. When the first band has seeded itself satisfactorily, and\r\nthe young growth has come to require more light (which may take several\r\nyears), we remove another band around it, and thus the regeneration\r\nprogresses. Where no young growth already exists, of course the first\r\nopening is made to afford a start, and afterwards the enlargement\r\nfollows as occasion requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE OF OPENINGS.\r\n\r\nThe size of the openings and the rapidity with which they should be\r\nenlarged vary, of course, with local conditions and the species which\r\nis to 'be favored, the light-needing species requiring larger openings\r\nand quicker light additions than the shade-enduring. It is difficult to\r\ngive any rules, since the modifications due to local conditions are so\r\nmanifold, requiring observation and judgment. Caution in not opening\r\ntoo much at a time and too quickly may avoid failure in securing good\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nIn general, the first openings may contain from one-fourth to one-half\r\nan acre or more, and the gradual enlarging may progress by clearing\r\nbands of a breadth not to exceed the height of the surrounding timber.\r\n\r\nThe time of the year when the cutting is to be done is naturally in\r\nwinter, when the farmer has the most leisure, and when the wood seasons\r\nbest after felling and is also most readily moved. Since it is expected\r\nthat the seed fallen in the autumn will sprout in the spring, all wood\r\nshould, of course, be removed from the seed ground.\r\n\r\nThe first opening, as well as the enlargement of the groups, should\r\nnot be made at once, but by gradual thinning out, if the soil is\r\nnot in good condition to receive and germinate the seed and it is\r\nimpracticable to put it in such condition by artificial means--hoeing\r\nor plowing.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, quite practicable--nay, sometimes very desirable--to\r\nprepare the soil for the reception and germination of the seed. Where\r\nundesirable undergrowth has started, it should be cut out, and where\r\nthe soil is deteriorated with weed growth or compacted by the tramping\r\nof cattle, it should be hoed or otherwise scarified, so that the seed\r\nmay find favorable conditions. To let pigs do the plowing and the\r\ncovering of acorns is not an uncommon practice abroad.\r\n\r\nIt is also quite proper, if the reproduction from the seed of the\r\nsurrounding mother trees does not progress satisfactorily, to assist,\r\nwhen an opportunity is afforded, by planting such desirable species as\r\nwere or were not in the composition of the original crop.\r\n\r\nIt may require ten, twenty, or forty years or more to secure the\r\nreproduction of a wood lot in this way. A new growth, denser and better\r\nthan the old, with timber of varying age, will be the result. The\r\nprogress of the regeneration in groups is shown on the accompanying\r\nplan, the different shadings showing the successive additions of young\r\ncrop, the darkest denoting the oldest parts, first regenerated. If we\r\nshould make a section through any one of the groups, this, ideally\r\nrepresented, would be like figure 14, the old growth on the outside,\r\nthe youngest new crop adjoining it, and tiers of older growths of\r\nvarying height toward the center of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIND MANTLE.\r\n\r\nOn the plan there will be noted a strip specially shaded, surrounding\r\nthe entire plat (fig. 13, _a_), representing a strip of timber which\r\nshould surround the farmer's wood lot, and which he should keep as\r\ndense as possible, especially favoring undergrowth. This part, if\r\npracticable, should be kept reproduced as coppice or by the method of\r\nselection, i. e., by taking out trees hero and there. When gaps are\r\nmade, they should be filled, if possible, by introducing shade-enduring\r\nkinds, which, like the spruces and firs and beech, retain their\r\nbranches down to the foot for a long time. This mantle is intended to\r\nprotect the interior against the drying influence of winds, which are\r\nbound to enter the small wood lot and deteriorate the soil. The smaller\r\nthe lot, the more necessary and desirable it is to maintain such a\r\nprotective cover or wind-break.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Appearance of regeneration by group method.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPICE.\r\n\r\nBesides reproducing a wood crop from the seed of mother trees or by\r\nplanting, there is another reproduction possible by sprouts from the\r\nstump. This, to be sure, can be done only with broad-leaved species,\r\nsince conifers, with but few exceptions, do not sprout from the stump.\r\nWhen a wood lot is cut over and over again, the reproduction taking\r\nplace by such sprouts we call coppice.\r\n\r\nMost wooded areas in the Eastern States have been so cut that\r\nreproduction from seed could not take place, and hence we have large\r\nareas of coppice, with very few seedling trees interspersed. As we\r\nhave seen in the chapter on \"How trees grow,\" the sprouts do not\r\ndevelop into as good trees as the seedlings. They grow faster, to be\r\nsure, in the beginning, but do not grow as tall and are apt to be\r\nshorter lived.\r\n\r\nFor the production of firewood, fence, and post material, coppice\r\nmanagement may suffice, but not for dimension timber. And even to keep\r\nthe coppice in good reproductive condition, care should be taken to\r\nsecure a certain proportion of seedling trees, since the old stumps,\r\nafter repeated cutting, tail to sprout and die out.\r\n\r\nSoil and climate influence the success of the coppice; shallow\r\nsoils produce weaker but more numerous sprouts and are more readily\r\ndeteriorated by the repeated laying bare of the soil; a mild climate is\r\nmost favorable to a continuance of the reproductive power of the stump.\r\n\r\nSome species sprout more readily than others; hence the composition\r\nof the crop will change, unless attention is paid to it. In the\r\ncoppice, as in any other management of a natural wood crop, a desirable\r\ncomposition must first be secured, which is done by timely improvement\r\ncuttings, as described in a previous section.\r\n\r\nThe best trees for coppice in the northeastern States are the chestnut,\r\nvarious oaks, hickory, ash, elm, maples, basswood, and black locust,\r\nwhich are all good sprouters.\r\n\r\nWhen cutting is done for reproduction, the time and manner are the main\r\ncare. The best results are probably obtained, both financially and with\r\nregard to satisfactory reproduction, when the coppice is cut between\r\nthe twentieth and thirtieth years. All cutting must be done in early\r\nspring or in winter, avoiding, however, days of severe frost, which is\r\napt to sever the bark from the trunk and to kill the cambium. Cutting\r\nin summer kills the stump, as a rule. The cut should be made slanting\r\ndownward, and as smooth as possible, to prevent collection of moisture\r\non the stump and the resulting decay, and as close as possible to\r\nthe ground, where the stump is less exposed to injuries, and the new\r\nsprouts, starting close to the ground, may strike independent roots.\r\n\r\nFail places or gaps should be filled by planting. This can be readily\r\ndone by bending to the ground some of the neighboring sprouts, when 2\r\nto 3 years old, notching, fastening them down with a wooden hook or a\r\nstone, and covering them with soil a short distance (4 to 6 inches)\r\nfrom the end. The sprout will then strike root, and after a year or so\r\nmay be severed from the mother stock by a sharp cut (fig. 15).\r\n\r\nFor the recuperation of the crop, it is desirable to maintain a supply\r\nof seedling trees, which may be secured either by the natural seeding\r\nof a few mother trees of the old crop which are left, or by planting.\r\nThis kind of management, coppice with seedling or standard trees\r\nintermixed, if the latter are left regularly and well distributed over\r\nthe wood lot, leads to a management called \"standard coppice.\" In this\r\nit is attempted to avoid the drawbacks of the coppice, viz, failure to\r\nproduce dimension material and running out of the stocks. The former\r\nobject is, however, only partially accomplished, as the trees grown\r\nwithout sufficient side shading are apt to produce branchy boles and\r\nhence knotty timber, besides injuring the coppice by their shade.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN OF MANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\nIn order to harmonize the requirements of the wood lot from a\r\nsylvicultural point of view, and the needs of the farmer for wood\r\nsupplies, the cutting must follow some systematic plan.\r\n\r\nThe improvement cuttings need not, in point of time, have been made all\r\nover the lot before beginning the cuttings for regeneration, provided\r\nthey have been made in those parts which are to be regenerated. Both\r\nthe cuttings may go on simultaneously, and this enables the farmer\r\nto gauge the amount of cutting to his consumption. According to the\r\namount of wood needed, one or more groups may be started at the same\r\ntime. It is, however, desirable, for the sake of renewing the crop\r\nsystematically, to arrange the groups in a regular order over the lot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Method of layering to produce new stocks in\r\ncoppice wood.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. HOW TO CULTIVATE THE WOOD CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere only firewood is desired, i. e., wood without special form, size,\r\nor quality, no attention to the crop is necessary, except to insure\r\nthat it covers the ground completely. Nevertheless, even in such a\r\ncrop, which is usually managed as coppice,[2] some of the operations\r\ndescribed in this chapter may prove advantageous. Where, however, not\r\nonly quantity but useful quality of the crop is also to be secured,\r\nthe development of the wood crop may be advantageously influenced by\r\ncontrolling the supply of light available to the individual trees.\r\n\r\n[2] See page 35 for description of coppice.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to repeat here briefly what has been explained in\r\nprevious pages regarding the influence of light on tree development.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF LIGHT ON WOOD PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nDense shade preserves soil moisture, the most essential element for\r\nwood production; a close stand of suitable kinds of trees secures this\r\nshading and prevents the surface evaporation of soil moisture, making\r\nit available for wood production. But a close stand also cuts off side\r\nlight and confines the lateral growing space, and hence prevents the\r\ndevelopment of side branches and forces the growth energy of the soil\r\nto expend itself in height growth; the crown is carried up, and long,\r\ncylindrical shafts, clear of branches, are developed; a close stand\r\nthus secures desirable form and quality. Yet, since the quality of\r\nwood production or accretion (other things being equal) is in direct\r\nproportion to the amount of foliage and the available light, and since\r\nan open position promotes the development of a larger crown and of\r\nmore foliage, an open stand tends to secure a larger amount of wood\r\naccretion on each tree. On the other hand, a tree grown in the open,\r\nbesides producing more branches, deposits a larger proportion of wood\r\nat The base, so that the shape of the bole becomes more conical, a\r\nform which in sawing proves unprofitable; whereas a tree grown in the\r\ndense forest both lengthens its shaft at the expense of branch growth\r\nand makes a more even deposit of wood over the whole trunk, thus\r\nattaining a more cylindrical form. While, then, the total amount of\r\nwood production per acre may be as large in a close stand of trees as\r\nin an open one (within limits), the distribution of this amount among\r\na larger or smaller number of individual trees produces different\r\nresults in the quality of the crop. And since the size of a tree or log\r\nis important in determining its usefulness and value, the sooner the\r\nindividual trees reach useful size, without suffering in other points\r\nof quality, the more profitable the whole crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF TREES PER ACRE.\r\n\r\nThe care of the forester, then, should be to maintain the smallest\r\nnumber of individuals on the ground which will secure the greatest\r\namount of wood growth in the most desirable form of which the soil and\r\nclimate are capable, without deteriorating the soil conditions. He\r\ntries to secure the most advantageous individual development of single\r\ntrees without suffering the disadvantages resulting from too open\r\nstand. The solution of this problem requires the greatest skill and\r\njudgment, and rules can hardly be formulated with precision, since for\r\nevery species or combination of species and conditions these rules must\r\nbe modified.\r\n\r\nIn a well-established young crop the number of seedlings per acre\r\nvaries greatly, from 3,000 to 100,000, according to soil, species, and\r\nthe manner in which it originated, whether planted, sown, or seeded\r\nnaturally.[3] Left to themselves, the seedlings, as they develop, begin\r\nto crowd each other. At first this crowding results only in increasing\r\nthe height growth and in preventing the spread and full development\r\nof side branches; by and by the lower branches failing to receive\r\nsufficient light finally die and break off--the shaft \"clears itself.\"\r\nThen a distinct development of definite crowns takes place, and after\r\nsome years a difference of height growth in different individuals\r\nbecomes marked. Not a few trees fail to reach the general upper crown\r\nsurface, and, being more or less overtopped, we can readily classify\r\nthem according to height and development of crown, the superior or\r\n\"dominating\" ones growing more and more vigorously, the inferior or\r\n\"dominated\" trees falling more and more behind, and finally dying for\r\nlack of light, and thus a natural reduction in numbers, or thinning,\r\ntakes place. This natural thinning goes on with varying rates at\r\ndifferent ages continuing through the entire life of the crop, so\r\nthat, while only 4,000 trees per acre may be required in the tenth\r\nyear to make a dense crown cover or normally close stand, untouched by\r\nman, in the fortieth year 1,200 would suffice to make the same dense\r\ncover, in the eightieth year 350 would be a full stand, and in the one\r\nhundredth not more than 250, according to soil and species, more or\r\nless. As we can discern three stages in the development of a single\r\ntree--the juvenile, adolescent, and mature--so, in the development\r\nof a forest growth, we may distinguish three corresponding stages,\r\nnamely, the \"thicket\" or brushwood, the \"pole-wood\" or sapling, and\r\nthe \"timber\" stage. During The thicket stage, in which the trees have\r\na bushy appearance, allowing hardly any distinction of stem and crown,\r\nthe height growth is most rapid. This period may last, according to\r\nconditions and species, from 5 or 10 to 30 and even 40 years--longer on\r\npoor soils and with shade-enduring species, shorter with light-needing\r\nspecies on good soils--and, while it lasts, it is in the interest of\r\nthe wood grower to maintain the close stand, which produces the long\r\nshaft, clear of branches, on which at a later period the wood that\r\nmakes valuable, clear timber, may accumulate. Form development is now\r\nmost important. The lower branches are to die and break off before they\r\nbecome too large. (See illustrations of the progress of \"clearing,\"\r\non pp. 15 and 16.) With light-needing species and with deciduous\r\ntrees generally this dying off is accomplished more easily than with\r\nconifers. The spruces and even the white pine require very dense\r\nshading to \"clear\" the shaft. During this period it is only necessary\r\nto weed out the undesirable kinds, such as trees infested by insect\r\nand fungus, shrubs, sickly, stunted, or bushy trees which are apt to\r\novertop and prevent the development of their better neighbors. In\r\nshort, our attention is now devoted mainly to improving the composition\r\nof the crop.\r\n\r\n[3] If the crop does not, at 3 to 5 years of age, shade the ground\r\nwell, with a complete crown cover, or canopy, it can not be said to be\r\nwell established and should be filled out by planting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEEDING AND CLEANING THE CROP.\r\n\r\nThis weeding or cleaning is easily done with shears when the crop is\r\nfrom 3 to 5 years old. Later, mere cutting back of the undesirable\r\ntrees with a knife or hatchet maybe practiced. In well-made artificial\r\nplantations this weeding is rarely needed until about the eighth or\r\ntenth year. But in natural growths the young crop is sometimes so dense\r\nas to inordinately interfere with the development of the individual\r\ntrees. The stems then remain so slender that there is danger of their\r\nbeing bent or broken by storm or snow when the growth is thinned out\r\nlater. In such cases timely thinning is indicated to stimulate more\r\nrapid development of the rest of the crop. This can be done most\r\ncheaply by cutting swaths or lanes one yard wide and us far apart\r\nthrough the crop, leaving strips standing. The outer trees of the\r\nstrip, at least, will then shoot ahead and become the main crop. These\r\nweeding or improvement cuttings, which must be made gradually and be\r\nrepeated every two or three years, are best performed during the summer\r\nmonths, or in August and September, when it is easy to judge what\r\nshould be taken out.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF THINNING.\r\n\r\nDuring the \"thicket\" stage, then, which may last from 10 to 25 and\r\nmore years, the crop is gradually brought into proper composition and\r\ncondition. When the \"pole-wood\" stage is reached, most of the saplings\r\nbeing now from 3 to 6 inches in diameter and from 15 to 25 feet in\r\nheight, the variation in sizes and in appearance becomes more and more\r\nmarked. Some of the taller trees begin to show a long, clear shaft and\r\na definite crown. The trees can be more or less readily classified\r\ninto height and size classes. The rate at which the height growth has\r\nprogressed begins to fall off and diameter growth increases. Now comes\r\nthe time when attention must be given to increasing this diameter\r\ngrowth by reducing the number of individuals and thus having all the\r\nwood which the soil can produce deposited on fewer individuals. This\r\nis done by judicious and often repeated thinning, taking out some of\r\nthe trees and thereby giving more light and increasing the foliage of\r\nthose remaining; and as the crowns expand, so do the trunks increase\r\ntheir diameter in direct proportion. These thinnings must, however, be\r\nmade cautiously lest at the same time the soil is exposed too much, or\r\nthe branch growth of those trees which are to become timber wood is\r\ntoo much stimulated. So varying are the conditions to be considered,\r\naccording to soil, site, species, and development of the crop, that it\r\nis well-nigh impossible, without a long and detailed discussion, to\r\nlay down rules for the proper procedure. In addition the opinions of\r\nauthorities differ largely both as to manner and degree of thinning,\r\nthe old school advising moderate, and the new school severer thinnings.\r\n\r\nFor the farmer, who can give personal attention to detail and whose\r\nobject is to grow a variety of sizes and kinds of wood, the following\r\ngeneral method may perhaps be most useful:\r\n\r\nFirst determine which trees are to be treated as the main crop or\r\n\"final harvest\" crop. For this 300 to 500 trees per acre of the\r\nbest grown and most useful kinds may be selected, which should be\r\ndistributed as uniformly as possible over the acre. These, then--or\r\nas many as may live till the final harvest--are destined to grow into\r\ntimber and are to form the special favorites as much as possible. They\r\nmay at first be marked to insure recognition; later on they will be\r\nreadily distinguished by their superior development The rest, which we\r\nwill call the \"subordinate\" crop, is then to serve merely as filler,\r\nnurse, and soil cover.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT TREES TO REMOVE.\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary, by careful observation of the surroundings of\r\neach of the \"final harvest\" crop trees, or \"superiors,\" as we may call\r\nthem, to determine what trees of the \"subordinate\" crop trees, or\r\n\"inferiors,\" must be removed. All nurse trees that threaten to overtop\r\nthe superiors must either be cut out or cut back and topped, if that\r\nis practicable, so that the crown of the superiors can develop freely.\r\nThose that are only narrowing in the superiors from the side, without\r\npreventing their free top development, need not be interfered with,\r\nespecially while they are still useful in preventing the formation and\r\nspreading of side branches on the superiors. As soon as the latter\r\nhave fully cleared their shafts, these crowding inferiors must be\r\nremoved. Care must be taken, however, not to remove too many at a time,\r\nthus opening the crown cover too severely and thereby exposing the\r\nsoil to the drying influence of the sun. Gradually, as the crowns of\r\ninferiors standing farther away begin to interfere with those of the\r\nsuperiors, the inferiors are removed, and thus the full effect of the\r\nlight is secured in the accretion of the main harvest crop; at the same\r\ntime the branch growth has been prevented and the soil has been kept\r\nshaded. Meanwhile thinnings may also be made in the subordinate crop,\r\nin order to secure also the most material from this part of the crop.\r\nThis is done by cutting out all trees that threaten to be killed by\r\ntheir neighbors. In this way many a useful stick is saved and the dead\r\nmaterial, only good for firewood, lessened. It is evident that trees\r\nwhich in the struggle for existence have fallen behind, so as to be\r\novertopped by their neighbors, can not, either by their presence or by\r\ntheir removal, influence the remaining growth. They are removed only in\r\norder to utilize their wood before it decays.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to remark again that an undergrowth of woody plants\r\ninterferes in no way with the development of the main crop, but, on\r\nthe contrary, aids by its shade in preserving favorable moisture\r\nconditions. Its existence, however, shows in most cases that the crown\r\ncover is not as dense as it should be, and hence that thinning is not\r\nrequired. Grass and weed growth, on the other hand, is emphatically\r\ndisadvantageous and shows that the crown cover is dangerously open.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the three questions, When to begin the thinnings, How\r\nseverely to thin, and How often to repeat the operation, must always\r\ndepend upon the varying appearance of the growth and the necessities\r\nin each case. The first necessity for interference may arise with\r\nlight-needing species as early as the twelfth or fifteenth year; with\r\nshade-enduring, not before the twentieth or twenty-fifth year. The\r\nnecessary severity of the thinning and the repetition are somewhat\r\ninterdependent. It is better to thin carefully and repeat the operation\r\noftener than to open up so severely at once as to jeopardize the soil\r\nconditions. Especially in younger growths and on poorer soil, it is\r\nbest never to open a continuous crown cover so that it could not close\r\nup again within 3 to 5 years; rather repeat the operation oftener.\r\nLater, when the trees have attained heights of 50 to 60 feet and clear\r\nboles (which may be in 40 to 50 years, according to soil and kind) the\r\nthinning may be more severe, so as to require repetition only every 6\r\nto 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the crown cover, then, is the criterion which directs\r\nthe ax. As soon as the crowns again touch or interlace, the time has\r\narrived to thin again. In mixed growths it must not be overlooked that\r\nlight-needing species must be specially protected against shadier\r\nneighbors. Shade-enduring trees, such as the spruces, beech, sugar\r\nmaple, and hickories, bear overtopping for a time and will then grow\r\nvigorously when more light is given, while light-needing species, like\r\nthe pines, larch, oaks, and ash, when once suppressed, may never be\r\nable to recover.\r\n\r\nParticular attention is called to the necessity of leaving a rather\r\ndenser \"wind mantle\" all around small groves. In this part of the\r\ngrove the thinning must be less severe, unless coniferous trees on the\r\noutside can be encouraged by severe thinning to hold their branches low\r\ndown, thus increasing their value as wind-breaks.\r\n\r\nThe thinnings, then, while giving to the \"final harvest\" crop all the\r\nadvantage of light for promoting its rapid development into serviceable\r\ntimber size, furnish also better material from the subordinate crop.\r\nAt 60 to 70 years of age the latter may have been entirely removed and\r\nonly the originally selected \"superiors\" remain on the ground, or as\r\nmany of them as have not died and been removed; 250 to 400 of these\r\nper acre will make a perfect stand of most valuable form and size,\r\nready for the final harvest, which should be made as indicated in the\r\npreceding chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--THE RELATION OF FORESTS TO FARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat all things in nature are related to each other and interdependent\r\nis a common saying, a fact doubted by nobody, yet often forgotten or\r\nneglected in practical life. The reason is partly indifference and\r\npartly ignorance as to the actual nature of the relationship; hence we\r\nsuffer, deservedly or not.\r\n\r\nThe farmer's business, more than any other, perhaps, depends for\r\nits success upon a true estimate of and careful regard for this\r\ninter-relation, he adapts his crop to the nature of the soil, the\r\nmanner of its cultivation to the changes of the seasons, and altogether\r\nhe shapes conditions and places them in their proper relations to each\r\nother and adapts himself to them.\r\n\r\nSoil, moisture, and heat are the three factors which, if properly\r\nrelated and utilized, combine to produce his crops. In some directions\r\nhe can control these factors more or less readily; in others they are\r\nwithdrawn from his immediate influence, and he is seemingly helpless.\r\nHe can maintain the fertility of the soil by manuring, by proper\r\nrotation of crops, and by deep culture; he can remove surplus moisture\r\nby ditching and draining; he can, by irrigation systems, bring water\r\nto his crops, and by timely cultivation prevent excessive evaporation,\r\nthereby rendering more water available to the crop; but he can not\r\ncontrol the rainfall nor the temperature changes of the seasons. Recent\r\nattempts to control the rainfall by direct means exhibit one of the\r\ngreatest follies and misconceptions of natural forces we have witnessed\r\nduring this age. Nevertheless, by indirect means the farmer has it\r\nin his power to exercise much greater control over these forces than\r\nhe has attempted hitherto. He can prevent or reduce the unfavorable\r\neffects of temperature changes; he can increase the available water\r\nsupplies, and prevent the evil effects of excessive rainfall; he can so\r\nmanage the waters which fall as to get the most benefit from them and\r\navoid the harm which they are able to inflict.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to control the rainfall itself by artifice, we should\r\nstudy how to secure the best use of that which falls, as it comes\r\nwithin reach of human agencies and becomes available by natural causes.\r\n\r\nHow poorly we understand the use of these water supplies is evidenced\r\nyearly by destructive freshets and floods, with the accompanying\r\nwashing of soil, followed by droughts, low waters, and deterioration of\r\nagricultural lands. It is claimed that annually in the United States\r\nabout 200 square miles of fertile soil are washed into brooks and\r\nrivers, a loss of soil capital which can not be repaired for centuries.\r\nAt the same time millions of dollars are appropriated yearly in the\r\nriver and harbor bills to dig out the lost farms from the rivers,\r\nand many thousands of dollars' worth of crops and other property are\r\ndestroyed by floods and overflows; not to count the large loss from\r\ndroughts which this country suffers yearly in one part or the other,\r\nand which, undoubtedly, could be largely avoided, if we knew how to\r\nmanage the available water supplies.\r\n\r\nThe regulation, proper distribution, and utilization of the rain waters\r\nin humid as well as in arid regions--water management--is to be the\r\ngreat problem of successful-agriculture in the future.\r\n\r\nOne of the most powerful means for such water management lies in the\r\nproper distribution and maintenance of forest areas. Nay, we can say\r\nthat the most successful water management is not possible without\r\nforest management.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST WATERS THE FARM.\r\n\r\nWhether forests increase the amount of precipitation within or near\r\ntheir limits is still an open question, although there are indications\r\nthat under certain conditions large, dense forest areas may have such\r\nan effect. At any rate, the water transpired by the foliage is certain,\r\nin some degree, to increase the relative humidity near the forest,\r\nand thereby increase directly or indirectly the water supplies in its\r\nneighborhood. This much we can assert, also, that while extended plains\r\nand fields, heated by the sun, and hence giving rise to warm currents\r\nof air, have the tendency to prevent condensation of the passing\r\nmoisture-bearing currents, forest areas, with their cooler, moister air\r\nstrata, do not have such a tendency, and local showers may therefore\r\nbecome more frequent in their neighborhood. But, though no increase in\r\nthe amount of rainfall may be secured by forest areas, the availability\r\nof whatever falls is increased for the locality by a well-kept and\r\nproperly located forest growth. The foliage, twigs, and branches break\r\nthe fall of the raindrops, and so does the litter of the forest floor,\r\nhence the soil under this cover is not compacted as in the open field,\r\nbut kept loose and granular, so that the water can readily penetrate\r\nand percolate; the water thus reaches the ground more slowly, dripping\r\ngradually from the leaves, branches, and trunks, and allowing more time\r\nfor it to sink into the soil. This percolation is also made easier by\r\nthe channels along the many roots. Similarly, on account of the open\r\nstructure of the soil and the slower melting of the snow under a forest\r\ncover in spring, where it lies a fortnight to a month longer than in\r\nexposed positions and melts with less waste from evaporation, the snow\r\nwaters more fully penetrate the ground. Again, more snow is caught and\r\npreserved under the forest cover than on the wind-swept fields and\r\nprairies.\r\n\r\nAll these conditions operate together, with the result that larger\r\namounts of the water sink into the forest soil and to greater depths\r\nthan in open fields. This moisture is conserved because of the reduced\r\nevaporation in the cool and still forest air, being protected from\r\nthe two great moisture-dissipating agents, sun and wind. By these\r\nconditions alone the water supplies available in the soil are increased\r\nfrom 50 to 60 per cent over those available on the open field.\r\nOwing to those two causes, then--increased percolation and decreased\r\nevaporation--larger amounts of moisture become available to feed the\r\nsprings and subsoil waters, and these become finally available to the\r\nfarm, if the forest is located at a higher elevation than the field.\r\nThe great importance of the subsoil water especially and the influence\r\nof forest areas upon it has so far received too little attention and\r\nappreciation. It is the subsoil water that is capable of supplying the\r\nneeded moisture in times of drought.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST TEMPERS THE FARM.\r\n\r\nAnother method by which a forest belt becomes a conservator of moisture\r\nlies in its wind-breaking capacity, by which both velocity and\r\ntemperature of winds are modified and evaporation from the fields to\r\nthe leeward is reduced.\r\n\r\nOn the prairie, wind-swept every day and every hour, the farmer has\r\nlearned to plant a wind-break around his buildings and orchards, often\r\nonly a single-row of trees, and finds even that a desirable shelter,\r\ntempering both the hot winds of summer and the cold blasts of winter.\r\nThe fields he usually leaves unprotected; yet a wind-break around his\r\ncrops to the windward would bring him increased yield, and a timber\r\nbelt would act still more effectively. Says a farmer from Illinois:\r\n\r\n  My experience is that now in cold and stormy winters fields protected\r\n  by timber belts yield full crops, while fields not protected yield\r\n  only one-third of a crop. Twenty-five or thirty years ago we never\r\n  had any wheat killed by winter frost, and every year we had a full\r\n  crop of peaches, which is now very rare. At that time we had plenty\r\n  of timber around our fields and orchards, now cleared away.\r\n\r\nNot only is the temperature of the winds modified by passing over\r\nand through the shaded and cooler spaces of protecting timber bolts\r\ndisposed toward the windward and alternating with the fields, but their\r\nvelocity is broken and moderated, and since with reduced velocity the\r\nevaporative power of the winds is very greatly reduced, so more water\r\nis left available for crops. Every foot in height of a forest growth\r\nwill protect 1 rod in distance, and several bolts in succession would\r\nprobably greatly increase the effective distance. By preventing deep\r\nfreezing of the soil the winter cold is not so much prolonged, and\r\nthe frequent fogs and mists that hover near forest areas prevent many\r\nfrosts. That stock will thrive better where it can find protection from\r\nthe cold blasts of winter and from the heat of the sun in summer is a\r\nwell-established fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST PROTECTS THE FARM.\r\n\r\nOn the sandy plains, where the winds are apt to blow the sand, shifting\r\nit hither and thither, a forest belt to the windward is the only means\r\nto keep the farm protected.\r\n\r\nIn the mountain and hill country the farms are apt to suffer from\r\nheavy rains washing away the soil. Where the tops and slopes are\r\nbared of their forest cover, the litter of the forest floor burnt up,\r\nthe soil trampled and compacted by cattle and by the patter of the\r\nraindrops, the water can not penetrate the soil readily, but is earned\r\noff superficially, especially when the soil is of, day and naturally\r\ncompact. As a result the waters, rushing over the surface down the\r\nhill, run together in rivulets and streams and acquire such a force as\r\nto be able to move loose particles and even stones; the ground becomes\r\nfurrowed with gullies and runs; the fertile soil is washed away; the\r\nfields below are covered with silt; the roads are damaged; the water\r\ncourses tear their banks, and later run dry because the waters that\r\nshould feed them by subterranean channels have been carried away in the\r\nflood.\r\n\r\nThe forest cover on the hilltops and steep hillsides which are not fit\r\nfor cultivation prevents this erosive action of the waters by the same\r\ninfluence by which it increases available water supplies. The important\r\neffects of a forest cover, then, are retention of larger quantities of\r\nwater and carrying them off under ground and giving them up gradually,\r\nthus extending the time of their usefulness and preventing their\r\ndestructive action.\r\n\r\nIn order to be thoroughly effective, the forest growth must be\r\ndense, and, especially, the forest floor must not be robbed of its\r\naccumulations of foliage, surface mulch and litter, or its underbrush\r\nby fire, nor must it be compacted by the trampling of cattle.\r\n\r\nOn the gentler slopes, which are devoted to cultivation, methods of\r\nunderdraining, such as horizontal ditches partly filled with stones and\r\ncovered with soil, terracing, and contour plowing, deep cultivation,\r\nsodding, and proper rotation of crops, must be employed to prevent\r\ndamage from surface waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST SUPPLIES THE FARM WITH USEFUL MATERIAL.\r\n\r\nAll the benefits derived from the favorable influence of forest bolts\r\nupon water conditions can be had without losing any of the useful\r\nmaterial that the forest produces. The forest grows to be cut and to be\r\nutilized; it is a crop to be harvested. It is a crop which, if properly\r\nmanaged, does not need to be replanted; it reproduces itself.\r\n\r\nWhen once established, the ax, if properly guided by skillful hands, is\r\nthe only tool necessary to cultivate it and to reproduce it. There is\r\nno necessity of planting unless the wood lot has been mismanaged.\r\n\r\nThe wood lot, then, if properly managed, is not only the guardian of\r\nthe farm, but it is the savings bank from which fair interest can be\r\nannually drawn, utilizing for the purpose the poorest part of the farm.\r\nNor does the wood lot require much attention; it is to the farm what\r\nthe workbasket is to the good housewife--a means with which improve\r\nthe odds and ends of time, especially during the winter, when other\r\nfarm business is at a standstill.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the material which the farmer can secure from the\r\nwood lot, besides the other advantages recited above, is of far greater\r\nimportance and value than is generally admitted.\r\n\r\nOn a well-regulated farm of 160 acres, with its 4 miles and more\r\nof fencing and with its wood fires in range and stove, at least 25\r\ncords of wood are required annually, besides material for repair of\r\nbuildings, or altogether the annual product of probably 40 to 50 acres\r\nof well-stocked forest is needed. The product may represent, according\r\nto location, an actual stumpage value of from $1 to $3 per acre, a sure\r\ncrop coming every year without regard to weather, without trouble and\r\nwork, and raised on the poorest part of the farm. It is questionable\r\nwhether such net results could be secured with the same steadiness from\r\nany other crop. Nor must it be overlooked that the work in harvesting\r\nthis crop falls into a time when little else could be done.\r\n\r\nWire fences and coal fires are, no doubt, good substitutes, but they\r\nrequire ready cash, and often the distance of haulage makes them\r\nrather expensive. Presently, too, when the virgin woods have been\r\nstill further culled of their valuable stores, the farmer who has\r\npreserved a sufficiently large and well-tended wood lot will be able\r\nto derive a comfortable money revenue from it by supplying the market\r\nwith wood of various kinds and sizes. The German State forests, with\r\ntheir complicated administrations, which eat up 4 per cent of the gross\r\nincome, yield, with prices of wood about the same as in our country,\r\nan annual net revenue of from $1 to $4 and more per acre. Why should\r\nnot the farmer, who does not pay salaries to managers, overseers, and\r\nforest guards, make at least as much money out of this crop when he is\r\nwithin reach of a market?\r\n\r\nWith varying conditions the methods would of course vary. In a general\r\nway, if he happens to have a virgin growth of mixed woods, the first\r\ncare would be to improve the composition of the wood lot by cutting\r\nout the less desirable kinds, the weeds of tree growth, and the poorly\r\ngrown trees which impede the development of more deserving neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe wood thus cut he will use as firewood or in any other way, and,\r\neven if he could not use it at all, and had to burn it up, the\r\noperation would pay indirectly by leaving him a better crop. Then he\r\nmay use the rest of the crop, gradually cutting the trees as needed,\r\nbut he must take care that the openings are not made too large, so\r\nthat they can readily fill out with young growth from the seed of\r\nthe remaining trees, and he must also pay attention to the young\r\naftergrowth, giving it light as needed. Thus without ever resorting to\r\nplanting he may harvest the old timber and have a now crop taking its\r\nplace and perpetuate the wood lot without in any way curtailing his use\r\nof the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS' BULLETINS.\r\n\r\nThese bulletins are sent free of charge to any address upon application\r\nto the Secretary of Agriculture.
