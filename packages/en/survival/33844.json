S. Lyon,\r\n        In Charge of Division of Plant Industry.\r\n\r\n            To Hon. F. Lamson-Scribner,\r\n            Chief Bureau of Agriculture, Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COCOANUT.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following pages are written chiefly in the interests of the\r\nplanter, but the writer feels that the great agricultural importance\r\nwhich the cocoanut palm is bound to assume in these Islands is\r\nsufficient to justify the presentation of some of its history and\r\nbotany.\r\n\r\nFor that part of the bulletin which touches upon the botany of the\r\ncocoanut I am indebted to Don Regino Garcia, associate botanist of the\r\nForestry Bureau; for that relating to its products and local uses, to\r\nthe courtesy of manufacturers in Laguna; and, for the rest, to personal\r\nexperience and observations made in Laguna Province and in the southern\r\nVisayan Islands where, as elsewhere in this Archipelago, the cocoanut\r\nmay properly be considered a spontaneous and not a cultivated product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legendary history of the \"Prince of Palms,\" [1] as it has been\r\ncalled, dates back to a period when the Christian era was young,\r\nand its history is developing day by day in some new and striking\r\nmanifestation of its utility or beauty. It seems not unreasonable to\r\nassume that much of the earlier traditionary history of the cocoanut\r\nmay have been inspired as much by its inherent beauty as by its\r\nuses. Such traditional proverbs Or folklore as I have gathered in\r\nthe Visayas recognize the influence of the beautiful, in so far as\r\nthe blessings of the trees only inure to the good; for instance,\r\n\"He who is cruel to his beast or his family will only harvest barren\r\nhusks from the reproving trees that witness the pusillanimous act;\"\r\nand, again, \"He who grinds the poor will only grind water instead of\r\nfat oil from the meat.\"\r\n\r\nTo this day the origin of the cocoanut is unknown. De Candolle (Origin\r\nof Cult. Plants, p. 574) recites twelve specific claims pointing to\r\nan Asiatic origin, and a single, but from a scientific standpoint\r\nalmost unanswerable, contention for an American derivation. None of\r\nthe remaining nineteen species of the genus Cocos are known to exist\r\nelsewhere in the world than on the American continent. His review of\r\nthe story results in the nature of a compromise, assigning to our\r\nown Islands and those to the south and west of us the distinction\r\nof having first given birth to the cocoanut, and that thence it was\r\ndisseminated east and west by ocean currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cocoanut (Cocos nucifera Linn.) is the sole oriental representative\r\nof a tropical genus comprising nineteen species, restricted, with\r\nthis single exception, to the New World.\r\n\r\nIts geographical distribution is closely confined to the two\r\nTropics. [2]\r\n\r\nNot less than nineteen varieties of C. nucifera are described by\r\nMiquel and Rumphius, and all are accepted by Filipino authors.\r\n\r\nWhether all of these varieties are constant enough to deserve\r\nrecognition need not be considered here. Many are characterized by\r\nthe fruits being distinctly globular, others by fruits of a much\r\nprolonged oval form, still others by having the lower end of the\r\nfruit terminating in a triangular point.\r\n\r\nIn the Visayas there is a variety in which the fibrous outer husk\r\nof the nut is sweet and watery, instead of dry and astringent, and\r\nis chewed by the natives like sugar cane. Another variety occurs in\r\nLuzon, known as \"Pamocol,\" the fruit of which seldom exceeds 20 cm. in\r\ndiameter. There is also a dwarf variety of the palm, which rarely\r\nexceeds 3 meters in height, and is known to the Tagalogs as \"Adiavan.\"\r\n\r\nThese different varieties are strongly marked, and maintain their\r\ncharacters when reproduced from seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cocoanut furnishes two distinct commercial products--the dried\r\nmeat of the nut, or copra, and the outer fibrous husk. These products\r\nare so dissimilar that they should be considered separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPRA AND COCOANUT OIL.\r\n\r\nUntil very recent years the demand for the \"meat\" of the cocoanut\r\nor its products was limited to the uses of soap boilers and\r\nconfectioners. Probably there is no other plant in the vegetable\r\nkingdom which serves so many and so varied purposes in the domestic\r\neconomy of the peoples in whose countries it grows. Within the past\r\ndecade chemical science has produced from the cocoanut a series of\r\nfood products whose manufacture has revolutionized industry and placed\r\nthe business of the manufacturer and of the producer upon a plane of\r\nprosperity never before enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThere has also been a great advance in the processes by which the\r\nnew oil derivatives are manufactured. The United States took the\r\ninitiative with the first recorded commercial factories in 1895. In\r\n1897 the Germans established factories in Mannheim, but it remained\r\nfor the French people to bring the industry to its present perfection.\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest reports of the American consul at Marseilles,\r\nthe conversion of cocoanut oil into dietetic compounds was undertaken\r\nin that city in 1900, by Messrs. Rocca, Tassy and de Roux, who in\r\nthat year turned out an average of 25 tons per month. During the year\r\njust closed (1902) their average monthly output exceeded 6,000 tons\r\nand, in addition to this, four or five other large factories were\r\nall working together to meet the world's demand for \"vegetaline,\"\r\n\"cocoaline,\" or other products with suggestive names, belonging to\r\nthis infant industry.\r\n\r\nThese articles are sold at gross price of 18 to 20 cents per kilo to\r\nthrifty Hollandish and Danish merchants, who, at the added cost of a\r\ncent or two, repack them in tins branded \"Dairy Butter\" and, as such,\r\nship them to all parts of the civilized world. It was necessary to\r\ndisguise the earlier products by subjecting them to trituration with\r\nmilk or cream; but so perfect is the present emulsion that the plain\r\nand unadulterated fats now find as ready a market as butter. These\r\n\"butters\" have so far found their readiest sale in the Tropics.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these great discoveries to the cocoanut planter can\r\nnot be overestimated, for to none of these purely vegetable fats do the\r\nprejudices attach that so long and seriously have handicapped those\r\nderived from animal margarin or margarin in combination with stearic\r\nacid, while the low fusion point of pure dairy butters necessarily\r\nprohibits their use in the Tropics, outside of points equipped with\r\nrefrigerating plants. The field, therefore, is practically without\r\ncompetition, and the question will no longer be that of finding a\r\nmarket, but of procuring the millions of tons of copra or oil that\r\nthis one industry will annually absorb in the immediate future.\r\n\r\nCocoanut oil was once used extensively in the manufacture of fine\r\ncandles, and is still occasionally in demand for this purpose in the\r\nPhilippines, in combination with the vegetable tallow of a species\r\nof Stillingia. It is largely consumed in lamps, made of a tumbler or\r\ndrinking glass half filled with water, on top of which float a few\r\nspoonfuls of oil, into which the wick is plunged. In remote barrios it\r\nis still in general use as a street illuminant, and so perfect is its\r\ncombustion that under a constant flicker it emits little or no smoke.\r\n\r\nWhen freshly expressed, the oil is an exceptionally good cooking fat,\r\nand enters largely into the dietary of our own people. The medicinal\r\nuses of the oil are various, and in the past it has been strongly\r\nadvocated for the cure of eczema, burns, as a vermifuge, and even\r\nas a substitute for cod-liver oil in phthisis. Its medicinal virtues\r\nare now generally discredited, except as a restorative agent in the\r\nloss of hair resulting from debilitating fevers. Its value in this\r\ndirection may be surmised from the splendid heads of hair possessed\r\nby the Filipino women, who generally use the oil as a hair dressing.\r\n\r\nCocoanut oil is derived from the fleshy albumen or meat of the ripe\r\nfruit, either fresh or dried. The thoroughly dried meat is variously\r\nknown as copra, coprax, and copraz. The exportation of copra is\r\ndetrimental to the best interests of the planter, tending to enrich\r\nthe manufacturer and impoverish the grower. The practice, however,\r\nis so firmly established that the writer can only record a probably\r\nfutile protest against its continuance.\r\n\r\nThe causes which for a long time will favor the exportation of copra\r\ninstead of oil in this Archipelago may be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) An oil-milling plant, constructed with due regard to economy of\r\nlabor and the production of the best quality of oil, would involve\r\nan outlay of capital of $2,500, gold, and upward, according to\r\ncapacity. The production of copra requires the labor of the planter's\r\nhands only.\r\n\r\n(2) The oil packages must be well-made barrels, casks, or metallic\r\nreceptacles. The initial cost of the packages is consequently great,\r\ntheir return from distant ports impracticable, and their sale value\r\nin the market of delivery is not sufficient to offset the capital\r\nlocked up in an unproductive form. On the other hand, copra may be\r\nsold or shipped in boxes, bags, sacks, and bales, or it may even be\r\nstored in bulk in the ship's hold.\r\n\r\n(3) When land transportation has to be considered, the lack of good\r\nroads still further impedes the oil maker. He can not change the\r\nsize and weight of his packages from day to day to meet the varying\r\npassability of the trail. On the other hand, packages of copra may\r\nbe adjusted to meet all emergencies, and the planter can thus take\r\nadvantage of the market conditions which may be denied to the oil\r\nmaker.\r\n\r\n(4) Perhaps the most serious difficulty the oil maker has to contend\r\nwith is the continuous discouragement he encounters from the agent\r\nof foreign factories, who buys in the open market and, bidding up to\r\nnearly the full oil value of the copra, finds an ample manufacturer's\r\nprofit paid by the press cake, so valuable abroad, but, unfortunately,\r\npractically without sale or value here. The residue from the mill may\r\nbe utilized both for food and for manure by the oil maker who is a\r\ntree owner and who maintains cattle. For either of these purposes\r\nits value rates closely up to cotton-seed cake, and the time is\r\nnot remote when it will be recognized in the Philippines as far\r\ntoo valuable a product to be permitted to be removed from the farm\r\nexcepting at a price which will permit of the purchase at a less\r\nfigure of an equivalent in manure. So active are the copra-buying\r\nagents in controlling this important branch of the industry, that\r\nthey refuse to buy the press cake at any price, with the result that,\r\nin two instances known to the writer, they have forced the closure\r\nof oil-milling plants and driven the oil maker back to his copra.\r\n\r\nMany copra-making plants in India and Ceylon are now supplied with\r\ndecorticating, breaking, and evaporating machinery. The process\r\nemployed in this Archipelago consists in first stripping the ripe\r\nfruit of the outer fibrous husk. This is effected by means of a stout,\r\nsteel spearhead, whose shaft or shank is embedded firmly in the soil\r\nto such a depth that the spear point projects above the ground rather\r\nless than waist high. The operator then holds the nut in his hands\r\nand strikes it upon the spear point, gives it a downward, rotary\r\ntwist, and thus, with apparent ease, quickly removes the husk. An\r\naverage operator will husk 1,000 nuts per day, and records have been\r\nmade of a clean up of as many as 3,000 per day. The work, however,\r\nis exceedingly hard, and involves great dexterity and wrist strength.\r\n\r\nAnother man now takes up the nut and with a bolo strikes it a smart\r\nblow in the middle, dividing it into two almost equal parts. These\r\nparts are spread out and exposed to the sun for a few hours, or such\r\ntime as may be necessary to cause the fleshy albumen to contract and\r\nshrink away from the hard outer shell, so that the meat may be easily\r\ndetached with the fingers.\r\n\r\nWeather permitting, the meat thus secured is sun dried for a day\r\nand then subjected to the heat of a slow fire for several hours. In\r\nsome countries this drying is now effected by hot-air driers, and a\r\nvery white and valuable product secured; but in the Philippines the\r\nuniversal practice is to spread out the copra upon what may be called\r\na bamboo grill, over a smoky fire made of the shells and husks, just\r\nsufficient heat being maintained not to set fire to the bamboo. The\r\nhalves, when dried, are broken by hand into still smaller irregular\r\nfragments, and subjected to one or two days of sun bath. By this time\r\nthe moisture has been so thoroughly expelled that the copra is now\r\nready to be sacked or baled and stored away for shipment or use.\r\n\r\nAll modern cocoanut-oil mills are supplied with a decorticator armed\r\nwith revolving discs that tear or cut through the husk longitudinally,\r\nfreeing the nut from its outer covering and leaving the latter in\r\nthe best possible condition for the subsequent extraction of its\r\nfiber. This decorticator is fed from a hopper and is made of a size\r\nand capacity to husk from 500 to 1,000 nuts per hour.\r\n\r\nRasping and grinding machinery of many patterns and makes, for\r\nreducing the meat to a pulp, is used in India, Ceylon, and China;\r\nand, although far more expeditious, offers no improvements, so far\r\nas concerns the condition to which the meats are reduced, over the\r\nmethods followed in the Philippines. Here the fleshy halves of the\r\nmeat are held by hand against a rapidly revolving, half-spherical\r\nknife blade which scrapes and shaves the flesh down to a fine degree\r\nof comminution. The resulting mass is then macerated in a little water\r\nand placed in bags and subjected to pressure, and the milky juice which\r\nflows therefrom is collected in receivers placed below. This is now\r\ndrawn off into boilers and cooked until the clear oil is concentrated\r\nupon the surface. The oil is then skimmed off and is ready for market.\r\n\r\nThe process outlined above is very wasteful. The processes I have seen\r\nin operation are very inadequate, and I estimate that, not less than\r\n10 per cent of the oil goes to loss in the press cake. This is a loss\r\nthat does not occur in establishments equipped with the best hydraulic\r\npresses. It is true that very heavy pressure carries through much\r\ncoloring matter not withdrawn by the primitive native mill, and that\r\nthe oil is consequently darker, and sooner undergoes decomposition;\r\nbut modern mills are now supplied with filtration plants through\r\nwhich this objection is practically overcome.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the above process are daily reproduced in thousands\r\nof Filipino homes, where the hand rasping of the nut, the expression\r\nof the milky juice through coarse cloth, its subsequent boiling down\r\nin an open pan, and the final skimming off of the oil are in common\r\npractice. Notwithstanding the cheapness of labor, it is only by\r\nemploying a mill well equipped with decorticating, rasping, hydraulic\r\ncrushing, and steam-boiling machinery, and with facilities to convert\r\nthe residue to feeding or other uses, that one may hopefully enter\r\nthe field of oil manufacture in these Islands in competition with\r\ncopra buyers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOIR.\r\n\r\nThe fiber of the cocoanut husk, or coir, as it is commercially known,\r\nhas never yet been utilized in this Archipelago, excepting occasionally\r\nfor local consumption.\r\n\r\nSecond in value only to the copra, this product has been allowed to\r\ngo to waste. The rejected husks are thrown together in immense heaps,\r\nwhich are finally burned and the ashes, exceedingly rich in potash\r\nand phosphoric acid, are left to blow away.\r\n\r\nAs the commercial value of the fiber is greater than the manurial\r\nvalue of the salts therein, it is economy to utilize the fiber and\r\npurchase potash and phosphoric acid when needed to enrich the soil.\r\n\r\nHighly improved and inexpensive power machinery for the complete and\r\neasy extraction of the fibers of the husk, either wet or dry, is now\r\nrapidly superseding the tedious hand process once in such general\r\nuse. Good patterns of machinery are shown in the \"husk-crushing mill\"\r\n(fig. 1) and in the \"fiber extractor\" (fig. 2). The first breaks,\r\ncrushes, and flattens out the husks by means of powerful, fluted metal\r\nrollers and, in the second the broken husks are fed over a revolving\r\ndrum set with teeth especially devised for tearing out the fiber from\r\nthe entire mass. Finally, it is fed into one of the many forms of\r\n\"willowing\" machines, which reduces the mass to clean fiber, which\r\nis now ready for grading, baling, and shipment. The residual dust\r\nand waste from this operation may be used as an absorbent for liquid\r\nmanures, and ultimately returned to the plantation. The yield of fiber\r\nvaries from 12 to 25 quintals of coir and 4 to 7 quintals of brush\r\nfiber per 10,000 average husks. In the Philippines the nuts yield\r\na large amount of fiber and a relatively small percentage of chaff\r\nand dust. With improved machinery and careful handling, 18 quintals\r\nof spinning coir and 5 quintals of bristle fiber from every 10,000\r\nhusks is a fair estimate of the product.\r\n\r\nAs the cost of manufacture is generally rated at one-half the selling\r\nprice, and as we must add a further charge of 20 per cent to cover\r\nfreight and commission, we have resulting from the sale of the 23\r\nquintals, or 2,300 kilos, at £16 per English ton, a balance of £11\r\n11s. per hectare.\r\n\r\nBut there are other considerations which should not be overlooked. The\r\nhusks of 10,000 cocoanuts will withdraw from the land 61.5 kilos of\r\npotash and 3 kilos of phosphoric acid, and the restoration of the full\r\namount is called for to compensate for the growing wants of the tree,\r\nin addition to that withdrawn by the crop. The necessary fertilizers\r\nare worth, approximately, 5 1/2d. per kilo, making a further reduction\r\nof £1 8s. and leaving as a net profit £10 3s., or, reduced to American\r\nmoney, nearly $50, gold, per hectare.\r\n\r\nThe machines above referred to will cost $800, gold, and $1,200\r\nadditional will purchase and house the power necessary to operate\r\nthem. Such a plant will work up 1,000 nuts a day, and handle in a\r\nyear the output of a grove of 30 hectares. With the addition of two\r\nor more fiber extractors the capacity of the plant may be doubled\r\nwithout material expense, and it should rather more than pay its\r\nentire cost in one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBA.\r\n\r\nTuba is the fresh or mildly fermented sap drawn from the inflorescence\r\nof the cocoanut.\r\n\r\nThere are no figures or data of any kind available as a basis for an\r\nestimate as to the importance of this product, but its extent may be\r\ninferred from the fact that the outlying groves about Cebu, Iloilo,\r\nand the larger Visayan towns are practically devoted to the production\r\nof tuba, and not to the manufacture of copra.\r\n\r\nTuba is collected from the unexpanded blossoms as soon as they have\r\nfairly pushed through the subtending bracts. To prevent any lateral\r\nexpansion, the flowers are tied with strips of the green leaf blade\r\nand then, with a sharp knife, an inch or two of the extreme tip is\r\nremoved. The whole flower cluster is now gently pulled forward until\r\nit arches downward. In a day or two the sap begins to drip and is then\r\ncaught in a short joint of bamboo, properly secured for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAs a healthy tree develops at least one or more flowering racemes\r\nevery month, and the flow of sap extends frequently over a period of\r\ntwo or more months, it is not uncommon to see a number of tubes in\r\nuse upon one tree.\r\n\r\nThe workmen usually visits the tree twice daily to collect the\r\nliquor drawn during the preceding twelve hours in the larger tube,\r\nwhich he carries upon his back. He slices daily a thin shaving from\r\nthe tip of the flower, in order that the wound may be kept open and\r\nbleeding. This process is kept up until nearly all of the flower\r\ncluster has been cut away, or until the sap ceases to flow.\r\n\r\nMore than a liter a day is sometimes drawn from one tree, and 5\r\nhectoliters is considered a fair annual average from a good bearing\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nIn its fresh state tuba has a sweetish, slightly astringent taste;\r\nbut, as the vessels in which it is collected are rarely cleansed,\r\nthey become traps for many varieties of insects, etc., and it is,\r\ntherefore, not a very acceptable beverage to a delicate stomach. When\r\npurified by a mild fermentation it is far more palatable.\r\n\r\nA secondary fermentation of tuba results in vinegar, and on this\r\naccount, chiefly, so much space has been devoted to this feature of\r\nthe industry. The vinegar so produced is of good strength and color, of\r\nthe highest keeping qualities, and of unrivaled flavor. Its excellence\r\nis so pronounced that upon its inherent merits it would readily find\r\nsale in the world's markets; and, although the local demand for the\r\ntuba now exceeds the production, its conversion into vinegar will\r\nprobably prove the more profitable industry in the future.\r\n\r\nSpirits are distilled and in some places sugar is still made from the\r\nflower sap; and, while the importance of these great staples may not\r\nbe overlooked, their commercial value as products of this tree are\r\nrelatively insignificant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR USES.\r\n\r\nIn addition to eighty-three utilities described by Mr. Pereira,\r\n[3] it is in very common use in the Philippines for:\r\n\r\n1. Cocoanut cream. The freshly ground fruit, reduced to a pulp and\r\nstrained, is consumed in that form or made into cakes with rice. It\r\nmakes a delicious and nutritious food. According to Dr. W. J. Gies,\r\nin experiments lately published, [4] its nutritive value is due to\r\n35.4 per cent of oil, about 10 per cent of carbohydrates, and 3 per\r\ncent of protein. The amount of cellulose (fibrous matter) is only 3\r\nper cent, and its digestibility is easy when the mass, by grating,\r\nis reduced to a fine degree of comminution.\r\n\r\n2. The \"milk\" or water is used sparingly as a beverage. It is also\r\nfermented and converted into inferior vinegar.\r\n\r\n3. The hard shell is used as fuel. When calcined, it produces a black,\r\nlustrous substance, used for dyeing leather.\r\n\r\n4. The same shell, aside from many uses quoted by Pereira, is used\r\nhere for every conceivable form of cup, ladle, scoop, and spoon.\r\n\r\n5. From the tough midrib of the leaf, strong and beautiful baskets of\r\nmany designs are made, also excellent and durable brooms, and from\r\nthe part where the midrib coalesces with the petiole pot-cleaning\r\nbrushes are made.\r\n\r\n6. The roots are sometimes used for chewing, as a substitute for\r\nAreca. They also furnish red dyestuff and with one end finely\r\nsubdivided may be used in making toothbrushes.\r\n\r\n7. The leaves and midribs, when burned, furnish an ash so rich in\r\npotash that it may be used alone in water as a substitute for soap\r\nor when a powerful detergent is required.\r\n\r\n8. The fiber of the husk is used extensively by the natives for\r\ncalking boats.\r\n\r\n9. The milk is used in the preparation of a native dish of rice,\r\nknown as \"casi.\" It is an excellent and highly prized dietary article,\r\nprepared with rice or in combination with chicken or locusts.\r\n\r\n10. The oil, melted with resins, is an effective and lasting covering\r\nfor anything desired to be protected from the ravages of white ants.\r\n\r\n11. The timber is used to bridge streams and bog holes, and the slowly\r\ndecaying leaves to fill them up and render them temporarily passable.\r\n\r\n12. The fiber is used in cordage and rope making, but to a far less\r\nextent here than in India.\r\n\r\nIts further uses are, in general, those current in the Orient. Briefly\r\nsummed up, its timber is employed in every form of house construction;\r\nits foliage in making mats, sacks, and thatches; its fruit in curry\r\nand sweetmeats; its oil for medicine, cookery, and illumination;\r\nits various juices in the manufacture of wines, spirits, sugar, and\r\nvinegar; while not to overlook a final and not inconsiderable Filipino\r\nproduct, the splinters of the midrib are used in making toothpicks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF LOCATION.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of a site for a cocoanut grove it is best to select\r\nland near the seashore and not extending inland more than 2 or 3\r\nmiles. Within this narrow zone there is commonly a deposit of rich,\r\npermeable, well-drained alluvium offering soil conditions of far\r\ngreater importance to successful tree growth than the mere exposure\r\nto marine influences. The success that has followed cocoanut growing\r\nin Cochin China, remote from the seaboard, in Annam and up the Ganges\r\nbasin one hundred or more miles from the coast, and in our own interior\r\nProvince of Laguna, definitely proves that immediate contiguity to\r\nthe sea is not essential to success.\r\n\r\nThat the cocoanut will grow and thrive upon the immediate seashore, in\r\ncommon with other plants, is simply an indication of its adaptability\r\nto environment. That it is at a positive disadvantage as a shore plant\r\nmay be determined conclusively by anyone who will examine the root\r\nsystem of a seashore-grown tree upturned by a wash or tidal wave, and\r\none uprooted from any cause, farther inland. It will be seen that the\r\nroot system of the maritime plant is immensely larger than the other,\r\nand that a corresponding amount of energy has been expended in the\r\nsearch through much inert material to forage for the necessary plant\r\nfood which the more favored inland species has found concentrated\r\nwithin a smaller zone.\r\n\r\nThe planting must be made in a thoroughly permeable soil.\r\n\r\nThe thick, fleshy roots of the newly upturned palm are loaded with\r\nwater, and tell us that an inexhaustible store of this fluid is an\r\nindispensable element of success. If further evidence of this were\r\nrequired, the testimony of drooping leaves and of crops shrunken\r\nfrom one-half to two-thirds, throughout the cocoanut districts and\r\nupon our own orchard in Mindanao, as the result of drought, confirm\r\nit and bespeak the necessity of copious water at all times.\r\n\r\nThe living tree upon the sea sands further emphasizes this necessity;\r\nfor, while its roots are lapped by the tides, it never flags or wilts,\r\nand from this we may gather the added value of a site which can be\r\nirrigated. The careful observer will note that along miles of sea\r\nbeach, among hundreds of trees whose roots are either in actual contact\r\nwith the incoming waves, or subjected to the subterranean influence of\r\nthe sea, there will never be so much as one tree growing in any beach\r\nbasin which collects and holds tidal water for even a brief time;\r\nand that, notwithstanding the large number of nuts that must have\r\nfound lodgment and favorable germinating influence in such places,\r\nnone succeed in growing. From this we may derive the assurance that\r\nthe desired water must be in motion and that land near stagnant water,\r\nor marsh land, is unsuitable to the plant.\r\n\r\nIt may frequently be observed that trees will be found growing\r\nfairly thriftily upon mounds or hummocks, in places invaded by\r\nflood or other waters which, by reason of backing or damming up,\r\nhave become stagnant. An examination of the roots of an overthrown\r\ntree in such a locality will show that all of those in the submerged\r\nzone have perished and rotted away, but that such is the vitality and\r\nrecuperative energy of the tree that it has thrown out a new feeding\r\nsystem in the dryer soil of the mound immediately surrounding the stem,\r\nwhich has been sufficient to successfully carry on the functions of\r\nnutrition, but altogether ineffective to anchor the tree securely,\r\nor to prevent its prostration before the first heavy gale.\r\n\r\nWhile this phase of the question will receive more attention when\r\nwe come to consider the chemistry of suitable manures, it may be\r\nsaid that, although analysis of the cocoanut ash derived from\r\nbeach-grown nuts shows a larger percentage of those salts that\r\nabound in sea water than those grown inland, yet the equal vigor,\r\nvitality, and fruitfulness of the latter simply confirm the plant's\r\nexceptional adaptability to environment and ability to take up and\r\ndecompose, without detriment, the salts of sea or brackish waters. As\r\na victim to the maritime idea, the writer in 1886 planted, far inland,\r\nseveral hundred nuts in beds especially devised to reproduce littoral\r\nconditions; shore gravel, sea sand, broken shells, and salt derived\r\nfrom sea water being used in preparing the seed beds. The starting\r\ngrowth was unexcelled. Then came a long period of yellowing decline\r\nand almost suspended animation, ultimately followed by a complete\r\nrestoration to health and vigor. The early excellent growth was\r\ndue to the fact that the first nourishment of the plant is entirely\r\nderived from the endosperm, and careful lifting of the young plants\r\ndisclosed the fact that recovery from their moribund condition was,\r\nin every instance, coincident with the time that the roots first\r\nsucceeded in working through the unpalatable mess about them into\r\nthe outlying good, sweet soil.\r\n\r\nThe exposure of the plantation is an important consideration, and\r\na maritime site should be selected in preference to one far inland,\r\nunless it be on an open, unprotected flat, exposed to the influence\r\nof every breeze or the fiercest gales that blow.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the cocoanut seems well fitted to endure winds of\r\nalmost any force, and that a remarkably abundant and strong circulation\r\nof air is essential to its best development is well shown by comparing\r\na tree subjected to it with the wretched, spindling specimen growing\r\nin a sheltered glen or ravine.\r\n\r\nStrong confirmation of this may be found within the artificial\r\nenvironment of a plant conservatory, where it is feasible to reproduce,\r\nin the minute detail of soil, water, temperature, and humidity,\r\nevery essential to its welfare except a good, strong breeze. As a\r\nconsequence, the palm languishes and it has long been deemed, on\r\nthis account, one of the most rebellious subjects introduced into\r\npalm-house cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL.\r\n\r\nThe soils for cocoanut growing are best selected by the process of\r\nexclusion. The study of the root development of the palm will prove\r\nto be an unerring guide to proper soil selection.\r\n\r\nThe roots of monocotyledons, to which great division this palm belongs,\r\nare devoid of the well-defined descending axis, which is possessed\r\nby most tree plants, and is often so strongly developed as to permit\r\nof rock cleavage and the withdrawal of food supplies from great depths.\r\n\r\nThe cocoanut has no such provision for its support. Its subterranean\r\nparts are simply a mat-like expanse of thick, fleshy, worm-like\r\ngrowths, devoid of any feeders other than those provided at the\r\nextreme tips of the relatively few roots. These roots are fleshy (not\r\nfibrous) and can not thrive in any soil through which they may not grow\r\nfreely in search of sustenance. It then becomes obvious that stiff,\r\ntenacious, or waxy soils, however rich, are wholly unsuitable. All\r\nvery heavy lands, or those that break up into solid, impervious lumps,\r\nand, lastly, any land underlaid near the surface with bed rocks or\r\nimpervious clays or conglomerates, are naturally excluded. All other\r\nsoils, susceptible of proper drainage, may be considered appropriate\r\nto the growth of the palm. Spons (Encyclop.) advocates light, sandy\r\nsoils. Simmonds (Trop. Agric.) names nine different varieties suitable\r\nfor this purpose, describing each at tedious length, and laying more\r\nor less emphasis upon a sandy mixture. These might all have been\r\ncovered by the single word \"permeable.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact every grain of sand in excess of that required to\r\nsecure a condition of perfect permeability is a positive disadvantage\r\nand must be paid for by a correspondingly larger area of cultivation\r\nand by future soil amendment. For the rest, the richer and deeper\r\nthe soil the less the expense of maintaining soil fertility.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory work of establishing an orchard is light, provided\r\nthe location is not one demanding the opening of drainage canals,\r\nand on lands of good porosity it involves neither subsoiling nor a\r\ndeeper plowing than to effectually cover the sod or any minor weed\r\ngrowths with which it may be covered.\r\n\r\nIt has long been the reprehensible practice of cocoanut growers to\r\nmerely dig pits, manure them, set the plants therein, and permit\r\nthe intervening lands (except immediately about the trees) to run to\r\nweeds or jungle.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines the native planter has not yet progressed beyond\r\nthe pit stage, nor do his subsequent cultural activities include more\r\nthan the occasional \"boloing\" of such weeds as threaten to choke and\r\nexterminate the young plants.\r\n\r\nFortunately it will not be long till the force and influence of\r\nexample are sure to be felt by our own planters. The progressive\r\nGerman colonist of Kamerun, German East Africa, and the South\r\nPacific Islands, as well as the French in Congo and Madagascar,\r\nare vigorously practicing conventional, modern orchard methods in\r\nthe treatment of their cocoanut groves, and it is amazing to read\r\nof discussions between Ceylon and Indian nut growers as to the best\r\nmethod of tethering cattle upon cocoanut palms in pasture, so as to\r\nobtain the most benefit from their excreta.\r\n\r\nWith an intelligent study of the plant and its characteristics\r\nit is believed that our native planter may put into practical use\r\nthe knowledge that the veteran Indian planter has in fifty years\r\nfailed to learn or utilize. He will learn that in time the entire\r\nsuperficies of his orchard will be required by the wide-spreading,\r\nsurface-feeding roots of the trees, and that pasture crops of any\r\nkind, grown for any purpose other than soiling or for green manuring,\r\nare prejudicial to future success. He will know that the initial\r\npreparation of all of his orchard and its continuous maintenance in\r\ngood cultivation are essential not only to the future welfare of\r\nhis trees but as a necessary means in connection with a judicious\r\nintermediate crop rotation.\r\n\r\nHence the preparatory requirements may be summed up as such preliminary\r\nsoil breaking as would be required for a corn crop in similar lands,\r\nsucceeded by such superficial plowings and cultivations as would be\r\nrequired to raise a cotton or any other of the so-called hoed crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED SELECTION.\r\n\r\nPreliminary to planting the very important question of seed selection\r\ncalls for close scrutiny on the planter's part.\r\n\r\nThe small native planter is often familiar with the individual\r\ncharacteristics of his trees. Owners of small estates in Cuyos and\r\nabout Zamboanga have pointed out to me trees that have the constant\r\nfruiting habit confirmed, others that will fruit erratically, and\r\nothers that flower yet rarely bear fruit. The fruitfulness of the\r\nfirst class is undoubtedly a result of accidental heredity, for the\r\nplanter has in the past made no selection except by chance, nor is the\r\ncharacteristic in any way due to his cultural system, which consists\r\nin planting the nut and letting nature and heredity do the rest. One\r\ntree in Zamboanga, the owner assured me, had never produced less than\r\n200 nuts annually for fully twenty-three years. Asked as to the bearing\r\nof all of his trees (of which he owned some three hundred), he stated\r\nthat from the lot he averaged 20 nuts at a picking, five times a year,\r\na total of 100 nuts; that the crop of these was very fluctuating,\r\nsome years falling to 60 nuts, again running as high as 130. The\r\nespecially prized tree did not vary appreciably. In very dry seasons\r\nthe nuts shrunk somewhat in size and the copra in weight, but the yield\r\nof nuts never fell below 200, and only once had amounted to 220. He\r\nhad raised a great number of seedlings, but it had never occurred to\r\nhim to select for planting the nuts from that particular tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING.\r\n\r\nWe have pointed out the necessity of selecting seed trees of known good\r\nbearing habits, and equal care should be exercised in selecting those\r\nthe nuts of which are well formed and uniform. This precaution will\r\nsuggest itself when one observes that some trees have the habit of\r\nproducing a few very large nuts and many of very small and irregular\r\nsize and shape, and it is obviously to the planter's interest to lend\r\nno assistance to the propagation and transmission of such traits. In\r\nview of what has been previously stated, it is almost superfluous\r\nearnestly to recommend planters to sow no seeds from young trees. The\r\nprinciple for this contention--that no seed should be selected except\r\nfrom trees of established, well-known fruiting habits--would seem to\r\ncover the ground effectually.\r\n\r\nThe best seed should be selected and picked when perfectly mature and\r\nlowered to the ground. The fall from a lofty tree not infrequently\r\ncracks the inner shell, without giving any external evidence of the\r\ninjury. A seed so injured will never sprout and therefore is worthless\r\nfor seed purposes.\r\n\r\nFreshly collected seed nuts contain in the husk more moisture than\r\nis required to effect germination, and if planted in this condition,\r\ndecay is apt to set in before germination occurs. To avoid this the\r\nnatives tie them in pairs, sling them over bamboo poles where they are\r\nexposed to the air but sheltered from the sun, and leave them until\r\nwell sprouted. It is, however, more expeditious to pile the nuts up in\r\nsmall heaps of eight to ten nuts, in partial shade, where the surface\r\nnuts may be sprinkled occasionally to prevent complete drying out.\r\n\r\nGermination is very erratic, sometimes occurring within a month\r\nand sometimes extending over four, five, or more months. When the\r\nyoung shoot or plumule (see illustration) has fairly thrust its way\r\nthrough the fibrous husk it is a good practice to go over the heaps\r\nand segregate those that have sprouted, carefully placing them so\r\nthat the growing tip be not deformed or distorted by the pressure\r\nof superincumbent nuts. When these sprouts are 30 to 50 cm. high,\r\nand a few roots have thrust through the husk, they are in the best\r\npossible condition for permanent planting.\r\n\r\nFirst. The original preparation of the land should be good and the\r\nsurface tilth at the time of planting irreproachable; i. e., free\r\nfrom weeds and so mellow that the soil can be closely and properly\r\npressed around the roots by hand.\r\n\r\nSecond. The orchard should be securely protected from the invasion of\r\ncattle, etc. It is sometimes impossible to protect orchards against\r\nentry of these animals. If the success of these precautions can not\r\nbe assured, then the nuts had better be grown in a closely protected\r\nnursery until about a year old, when the albumen of the seed will be\r\ncompletely assimilated and will therefore no longer attract vermin,\r\nand when the larger size of the plant will give it more protection\r\nfrom stray cattle.\r\n\r\nIn either case planting should be made concurrently with the opening of\r\nthe rainy monsoon, during which season further field operations will\r\nnot be required except when an intermittent, drier period indicates\r\nthe advisability of running the cultivator.\r\n\r\nThe planting \"pit\" fetish, in such common use in India, has nothing\r\nto commend it. If stable manures of any kind are available, a good\r\napplication at the time of planting will effect wonders in accelerating\r\nthe growth of the young plants.\r\n\r\nWhere the necessary protection is assured, the young seedling planted\r\nout as above recommended should start at once, without check of any\r\nkind, into vigorous growth.\r\n\r\nThe nursery-grown subject receives an unavoidable setback. Its roots\r\nhave been more or less mutilated and, as we may not prune the top\r\nsufficiently to compensate for the root injury, it is generally several\r\nmonths before the equilibrium of top and root is fully restored. In\r\nmost cases, by the end of the second year, it will have been far\r\noutstripped in the growing race by the former.\r\n\r\nThe history, habits, and characteristics of the cocoanut tree indicate\r\nthat it needs a full and free exposure to sun, air, and wind; and,\r\nas it makes a tree, under such circumstances, of wide crown expansion,\r\nthese indispensables can not be secured except by very wide planting.\r\n\r\nConventional recommendations cover all distances, from 5 to 8 meters,\r\nwith quincunx (i. e., triangular plantings) urged when the 8-meter\r\nplan is adopted. But the writer has seen too many groves spaced at\r\nthis distance in good soil, with interlacing leaves and badly spindled\r\nin the desperate struggle for light, air, and sun, ever to recommend\r\nthe quincunx, or any system other than the square, at distances not\r\nless than 9 meters and, in good soils, preferably 9.5 meters.\r\n\r\nThe former distance will allow for 123 and the latter 111 trees to\r\nthe hectare. They should be lined out with the greatest regularity, so\r\nas to admit at all times of cross plowing and cultivation as desired.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the treatment is one of cultural and manurial\r\nroutine.\r\n\r\nAnnual plowings should not be dispensed with during the life\r\nof the plantation. These plowings may be relatively shallow,\r\nsufficient to cover under the green manures and crops that are made\r\nan indispensable condition to the continued profitable conduct of\r\nthe industry. Nothing is to be gained by the removal of the earliest\r\nflowering spikes. Flowering is the congestion of sap at a special point\r\nwhich, if the grower could control it, he would wish to direct, in the\r\ncase of young plants, to the building up of leaf and wood. Cutting the\r\ninflorescence of the cocoanut results in profuse bleeding and, unless\r\nthis be checked by the use of a powerful styptic or otherwise, it is\r\ndoubtful if the desired end would be accomplished. The earlier crops\r\nof nuts should all be taken with extension cutters or from ladders. No\r\nshoulders for climbing should be cut in any tree, the stem of which\r\nhas not become dense, hard, and woody. Cut when the wood is the least\r\nbit succulent, they become inviting points of attack for borers.\r\n\r\nWith these reservations, there is everything to commend the practice\r\nof shouldering the tree, as offering the safest, most expeditious\r\nand economical way of making it possible to climb and secure the\r\nharvest. It is, of course, understood that the cuts should be made\r\nsloping outward, so as not to collect moisture and invite decay,\r\nand no larger than is strictly necessary for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURING. [5]\r\n\r\nThe manuring problem must be met and solved by the best resources at\r\nour command. The writer has had pointed out hundred of trees that,\r\nwholly guiltless of any direct application of manure, have borne\r\nexcellent crops for many successive years; but he has also seen\r\nhundreds of others in their very prime, at thirty years, which once\r\nproduced a hundred select nuts per year, now producing fluctuating\r\nand uncertain crops of fifteen to thirty inferior fruits.\r\n\r\nTime and again native growers have told me of the large and uniformly\r\ncontinuous crops of nuts from the trees immediately overshadowing their\r\ndwellings and, although some have attributed this to a sentimental\r\nappreciation and gratitude on the part of the palm at being made one\r\nof the family of the owner, a few were sensible enough to realize\r\nthat it came of the opportunity that those particular trees had to\r\nget the manurial benefit of the household sewage and waste.\r\n\r\nYet, the lesson is still unlearned and, after much diligent inquiry,\r\nI have yet to find a nut grower in the Philippines who at any time\r\n(except at planting) makes direct and systematic application of manure\r\nto his trees.\r\n\r\nIn India, Ceylon, the Penang Peninsula, and Cochin China, where the\r\ntree has been cultivated for generations, the most that was ever\r\nattempted until very recently was to throw a little manure in the\r\nhole where the tree was planted, and for all future time to depend\r\non the inferior, grass-made droppings of a few cattle tethered among\r\nthe trees, to compensate for the half million or more nuts that a\r\nhectare of fairly productive trees should yield during their normal\r\nbearing life.\r\n\r\nUpon suitable cocoanut soils--i. e., those that are light and\r\npermeable--common salt is positively injurious. In support of this\r\ncontention, I will state that salt in solution will break up and\r\nfreely combine with lime, making equally soluble chlorids of lime\r\nwhich, of course, freely leach out in such a soil and carry down\r\nto unavailable depths these salts, invaluable as necessary bases\r\nto render assimilable most plant foods; and that, on this account,\r\ncommercial manures containing large amounts of salt, are always to\r\nbe used with much discretion, owing to the danger of impoverishing\r\nthe supply of necessary lime in the soil.\r\n\r\nFinally, so injurious is the direct application of salt to the roots\r\nof most plants that the invariable custom of trained planters (who,\r\nfor the sake of the potash contained, are compelled to use crude\r\nStassfurt mineral manures, which contain large quantities of common\r\nsalt) is to apply it a very considerable time before the crop is\r\nplanted, in order that this deleterious agent should be well leached\r\nand washed away from the immediate field of root activity.\r\n\r\nThat the cocoanut is able to take up large quantities of salt may not\r\nbe disputed. That the character of its root is such as to enable it to\r\ndo so without the injury that would occur to most cultivated plants\r\nI have previously shown, while the history of the cocoanut's inland\r\ncareer, and the records of agricultural chemistry, both conclusively\r\npoint to the fact that its presence is an incident that in no way\r\ncontributes to the health, vigor, or fruitfulness of the tree.\r\n\r\nMr. Cochran's analysis, based upon the unit of 1,000 average nuts,\r\nweighing in the aggregate 3,125 pounds, discloses a drain upon soil\r\nfertility for that number, amounting in round numbers to--\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Pounds.\r\n\r\n    Nitrogen                 8 1/4\r\n    Potash                  17\r\n    Phosphoric acid          3\r\n\r\n\r\nReducing this to crop and area, and taking 60 fruits per annum per tree\r\nas a fair mean for the bearing groves in our cocoanut districts and\r\non those rare estates where a systematic spacing of about 173 trees\r\nto the hectare has been made, we should have an annual harvest of\r\n10,300 nuts, or, stated in round numbers, 10,000, which will exhaust\r\neach year from the soil a total of--\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Pounds.\r\n\r\n    Nitrogen               82 1/2\r\n    Potash                170\r\n    Phosphoric acid        30\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cocoanut, therefore, while a good feeder, may not be classed with\r\nthe most depleting of field crops.\r\n\r\nTo make this clear I exhibit, by way of contrast, the drafts made\r\nby a relatively good crop of two notoriously soil-impoverishing\r\ncrops--tobacco and corn--and, on the other hand, the drafts made by\r\nan equivalent average cotton crop--a product considered to make but\r\nlight drains upon sources of soil fertility.\r\n\r\nA proportionate tobacco crop of 1,000 kilos per hectare will withdraw\r\nfrom the soil (reduced to the same standard of weights adopted by\r\nMr. Cochran)--\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Pounds.\r\n\r\n    Nitrogen            168\r\n    Potash              213\r\n    Phosphoric acid      23\r\n\r\n\r\nAn equivalent crop of shelled corn, say, of 125 bushels per hectare,\r\nwill withdraw--\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Pounds.\r\n\r\n    Nitrogen            200\r\n    Potash              135\r\n    Phosphoric acid      75\r\n\r\n\r\nwhile a relative crop of lint cotton of 237 kilos (700 pounds) per\r\nhectare [6] will only exhaust, in round numbers--\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Pounds.\r\n\r\n    Nitrogen            114\r\n    Potash               70\r\n    Phosphoric acid      30\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an analogy between these four products that makes them\r\nall comparable, in so far as all are largely surface feeders, and,\r\nas experience shows that there can be no continuing success with\r\nthe last three that does not include both cultivation and manuring,\r\nwe may use the analogy to infer a like indispensable necessity for\r\nthe successful issue of the first.\r\n\r\nCultivation as a manurial factor should, therefore, not be overlooked,\r\nand all the more strongly does it become emphasized by the very\r\ndifficulties that for some years to come must beset the Philippine\r\nplanter in the way of procuring direct manures.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the specific application of manures and how to make\r\nthe most of our resources, we shall have to turn back to the analysis\r\nof the nut and note that, relatively to other crops, it makes small\r\ndemands for nitrogen. At the same time it must not be forgotten that\r\nthese chemical determinations only refer to the fruit and that,\r\nwith the present incomplete data and lack of investigation of the\r\nconstituent parts of root, stem, leaf, and branch, we have nothing\r\nto guide us but what we may infer from the behavior of the plant and\r\nits relationship to plants of long-deferred fruition, whose manurial\r\nwants are well understood.\r\n\r\nIt is now the most approved orchard practice to encourage an early\r\ndevelopment of leaf and branch by the liberal application of nitrogen,\r\nwhose stimulant actions upon growth are conceded as the best.\r\n\r\nIn temperate regions, the exigencies of climate exact that this be\r\ndone with discretion and care, in order that the unduly stimulated\r\ngrowths may be fully ripened and matured against the approach of an\r\ninclement season. In the Tropics no such limitations exist, and the\r\nearly growth of the tree may be profitably stimulated to the highest\r\npitch. That this general treatment, as applied to young fruit trees,\r\nis specifically the one indicated in the early life of the cocoanut,\r\nmay be quickly learned by him who will observe the avidity with\r\nwhich the fleshy roots of a young cocoanut will invade, embrace,\r\nand disintegrate a piece of stable manure.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding lack of chemical analysis, we may not question the\r\nfact that considerable supplies of both potash and phosphoric acid\r\nare withdrawn in the building up of leaf and stem; but these are\r\nfound in sufficient quantity in soils of average quality to meet\r\nthe early requirements of the plant. It is only when the fruiting\r\nage is reached that demands are made, especially upon the potash,\r\nwhich the planter is called upon to make good.\r\n\r\nGood cultivation, the application of a generous supply of stimulating\r\nnitrogen during its early career, and the gradual substitution in\r\nlater life of manures in which potash and phosphoric acid, particularly\r\nthe former, predominate, are necessary.\r\n\r\nHow, then, may we best apply the nitrogen requirements of its early\r\nlife? Undoubtedly through the application of abundant supplies of\r\nstable manures, press cakes, tankage, or of such fertilizers as furnish\r\nnitrogen in combination with the large volume of humus necessary to\r\nminister to the gross appetite of the plant under consideration. But\r\nthe chances are that none of these are available, and the planter\r\nmust have recourse to some of the green, nitrogen-gathering manures\r\nthat are always at his command.\r\n\r\nHe must sow and plow under crops of pease, beans, or other legumes\r\nthat will furnish both humus and nitrogen in excess of what they\r\nremove. Incidentally, they will draw heavily upon the potash deposits\r\nof the soil, and they must all be turned back, or, if fed, every\r\nkilo of the resulting manure must be scrupulously returned. He must\r\npay for the cultivation of the land, for the growing of crops that\r\nhe turns back as manure (and that involves further expense for their\r\ngrowing and plowing under), and, in addition, he must be subject to\r\nsuch outlay for about seven years before he can begin to realize for\r\nthe time and labor expended.\r\n\r\nBut there are expedients to which the planter may have recourse\r\nwhich, if utilized, may return every dollar of cultural outlay. By\r\nthe use of a wise rotation he can not only maintain his land in a good\r\nproductive condition but realize a good biennial crop that will keep\r\nthe plantation from being a financial drag. The rotation that occurs\r\nto me as most promising on the average cocoanut lands of these Islands\r\nwould be, first, a green manure crop, followed by corn and legumes,\r\nsucceeded by cotton, and then back to green manures.\r\n\r\nTo make the first green crop effective as a manure, both lime and\r\npotash are essential--the former to make available the nitrogen we\r\nhope to gather, and the potash in order to secure the largest and\r\nquickest growth of the pulse we are to raise for manurial purposes.\r\n\r\nBoth these elements are generally in good supply in our cocoanut lands;\r\nbut, if there is uncertainty upon this point, both should be supplied,\r\nin some form. Fortunately, the former is cheap and abundant in most\r\nparts of the Archipelago, and, when well slaked, may be freely applied\r\nwith benefit, at the rate of a ton or even more to the hectare.\r\n\r\nIn default of the mineral potash salts, the grower must seek unleached\r\nwood ashes, either by burning his own unused jungle land to procure\r\nthem or by purchasing them from the neighbor who has such land to\r\nburn over. If located on the littoral, he will carefully collect\r\nall the seaweed that is blown in, although in our tropical waters\r\nthe huge and abundant marine algæ are mostly lacking. Such as are\r\nfound, however, furnish a not inconsiderable amount of potash, and,\r\nin the extremities to which planters remote from commercial centers\r\nare driven, no source is too inconsiderable to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe first green crop selected will be one known to be of tropical\r\norigin which, with fair soil conditions, will not fail to give a good\r\nyield. He may with safety try any of the native rank-growing beans,\r\nor cowpeas, soja, or velvet beans; or, if these are not procurable, he\r\nhas at command everywhere an unstinted seed supply of Cajanus indicus,\r\nor of Clitorea ternatea, which will as well effect the desired end--to\r\nwit, a great volume of humus and a new soil supply of nitrogen. It\r\nremains for the planter to determine if the crop thus grown is to\r\nbe plowed under, or if he will use it to still better advantage by\r\npartially feeding it, subject, as previously stated, to an honest\r\nreturn to the land of all the manure resulting therefrom.\r\n\r\nHe may utilize it in any way, even to selling the resulting seed\r\ncrop, provided all the remaining brush is turned back to the land\r\nand a portion of the money he receives for the seed be reinvested in\r\nhigh-grade potash and phosphatic manures. The plantation should now\r\nbe in fair condition for a corn crop, and, as a very slight shading\r\nis not prejudicial to the young palms, the corn can be planted close\r\nenough to the trees, leaving only sufficient space to admit of the\r\nfree cultivation that both require.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that corn makes the most serious inroads\r\nupon our soil fertility of any of the crops in our rotation, and,\r\nunless by this time the planter is prepared to feed all the grain\r\nproduced to fatten swine or cattle, it had better be eliminated from\r\nthe rotation and peanuts substituted. In addition to this, he must\r\nstill make good whatever drains the corn will have made upon this\r\nelement of soil fertility.\r\n\r\nCropping to corn attacks the cocoanut at a new and vulnerable point,\r\nagainst which the careful grower must make provision. It will be\r\nremembered that an average corn crop makes very considerable drafts\r\nupon the soil supply of phosphoric acid; but, if the grain is used\r\nfor fattening swine, whose manure is much richer in phosphates than\r\nmost farm manures, and the latter is restored to the land, serious\r\nsoil impoverishment may be averted.\r\n\r\nThe next step in our suggested rotation is the cotton crop. Here,\r\ntoo, limitations are imposed upon the planter who is without abundant\r\nmanurial resources to maintain the future integrity of his grove. He\r\nmay sell the lint from his cotton, but he can not dispose of it\r\n(as is frequently done here) in the seed.\r\n\r\nIf the enterprise be not upon a scale that will justify the equipment\r\nof a mill and the manufacture of the oil, he has no alternative but\r\nto return the seed in lieu of the seed cake, wasteful and extravagant\r\nthough such a process be.\r\n\r\nThe oil so returned is without manurial value and, if left in the\r\nseed, is so much money wasted. The rational process, of course,\r\ncalls for the return of the press cake, either direct or in the form\r\nof manure after it has been fed. With this is also secured the hull,\r\nrich in both the potash and the phosphoric acid [7] which we now know\r\nis so essential to the future welfare of the grove.\r\n\r\nThe above rotation is simply suggested as a tentative expedient.\r\n\r\nThe ground will now be so shaded that we can not hope to raise more\r\ncatch crops for harvesting, although it may be possible during the\r\ndry season to raise a partial stand of pulses, of manure value only;\r\nbut, from the fruiting stage on, this becomes a minor consideration.\r\n\r\nThis stage of the cultural story brings us once more face to face\r\nwith the principle contended for at the beginning of this paper,\r\nnamely, that there can be no permanent prosperity in this branch of\r\nhorticulture until the crop is so worked up into its ultimate products\r\nthat none of the residue of manufacture goes to waste.\r\n\r\nAt best the return of these side products is insufficient, and, despite\r\ntheir careful husbandry, we can not ultimately evade a greater or less\r\nresort to inorganic manures of high cost and difficult procurement.\r\n\r\nThe residue from the press cake is rich in nitrogen and humus, which,\r\nin the ever-increasing shade of the grove, will become more and more\r\ndifficult to produce there through nitrogen-making agencies; but the\r\nwaste from the manufacture of coir and the ashes from the woody shell\r\nwill go far toward supplying the needed potash.\r\n\r\nSuch a system would, if closely followed, practically restrict the\r\nfarmer's ultimate purchases to a small quantity of acid phosphates,\r\nor of bone dust, which, in conjunction with good tillage, should\r\nserve to maintain the grove in a highly productive condition for an\r\nindefinite term of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION.\r\n\r\nAs an auxiliary manurial agent of definite, well-proven value in this\r\nArchipelago, I will briefly recite some of the benefits that may be\r\nexpected to follow occasional irrigation during the dry season.\r\n\r\nIt strongly accelerates growth and early maturity. A few irrigated\r\ntrees, reputed to be under five years from seed and already bearing\r\nfruit, were shown the writer on the Island of Joló. The growth was\r\nremarkably strong and vigorous, notwithstanding that the water of\r\nirrigation had been applied in such a way that the tree could only\r\nhope to derive a minimum of benefit from its application. It had merely\r\nbeen turned on from a convenient ditch whenever the soil seemed baked\r\nand dry, at intervals of one to three weeks, as circumstances seemed\r\nto require.\r\n\r\nIrrigation, but always in connection with subsequent cultivation,\r\nmay be considered equal to a crop guaranty that is not afforded so\r\neffectually by any purely cultural system.\r\n\r\nRarely has a better opportunity occurred to demonstrate the\r\nunquestioned benefits that have inured to these few Joló trees from\r\nthe use of irrigating waters than the present season of 1902-3. From\r\nmany sources reports come to this Bureau of trees failing, or dying\r\noutright, from lack of moisture. While it is true that the present\r\ndry season has had no parallel since 1885-86, and that the rainfall\r\nduring the dry season has been less than half the normal, yet it\r\nshould not be forgotten that, during the eight months from October to\r\nMay, inclusive, the average precipitation on the west coast, at the\r\nlatitude of Manila, is only about 460 mm. and that, when the amount\r\nfalls below this, the cocoanut is bound to suffer.\r\n\r\nThough it is true that the evil effects of drought may be modified,\r\nif not altogether controlled, by cultivation, the assistance of\r\nirrigation places the cultivator in an impregnable position. If\r\nevidence in support of this statement were called for, it might be\r\nfound to-day in the deplorable condition of those groves that have\r\nbeen permitted to run to pasture, as compared with those in which some\r\nattempts have been made to bolo out the encroaching weeds and grasses.\r\n\r\nIt is probably true that, except on very sandy soils, continued surface\r\nirrigation would aggravate the superficial root-developing tendency\r\nof the tree; and to what extent, if any, occasional laceration by\r\ndeep shovel tooth cultivation would injure the tree remains to be\r\nseen. There are, however, few economic plants that so quickly repair\r\nroot damage as the Palmæ, and, unless the seat of injury extends over\r\na very large area, it is probable that the resulting injury would be\r\nof no consequence, as compared with the general benefits that would\r\nresult from irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvest of the crop requires but a brief discussion. The nuts should\r\nbe plucked when ripe. The phenomenon of maturity can not be readily\r\ndescribed in print. It frequently is as evident in nuts of a bright\r\ngreen color as in those of a golden-yellow color, and the recognition\r\nis one of those things that can only be learned by experience.\r\n\r\nThe practice, so general in the Seychelles, of allowing the nut to\r\nhang till it falls to the ground is certainly undesirable in these\r\nIslands. On the contrary, the overripe nuts will seldom fall until\r\ndislodged by a storm, and it is no uncommon thing to see nuts that\r\nhave sprouted and started to grow upon trees in plantations where the\r\nharvest is left to the action of natural causes. Such nuts, of course,\r\nare entirely worthless for the manufacture of oil or copra, and even\r\nthe husk has depreciated in value, the finest coirs, in fact, being\r\nderived only from the fruits that have not attained full ripeness. In\r\nany case, the nuts should be picked and the crop worked up before any\r\nconsiderable enlargement or swelling of the embryo occurs. From this\r\ntime onward physiological changes arise which injuriously affect the\r\nquantity and quality of what is called the meat.\r\n\r\nThe heaping up of the nuts for some time after harvest favors some milk\r\nabsorption, which seems to facilitate the subsequent easy extraction\r\nof the endosperm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENEMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside of certain insects of the order Coleoptera, cocoanuts in\r\nthe Philippines are reasonably free from enemies; in some districts,\r\nclose to forest-clad areas, the raids of monkeys do some damage. A\r\ntree-nesting rat, which nibbles the young nuts, is also a source of\r\nconsiderable loss. The rat is best overcome by frequent disturbance of\r\nhis quarters. This involves the removal of the dead leaves and thatch\r\nthat form constantly about the base of the crown. But the wisdom of\r\nthis recommendation will depend entirely upon circumstances. As the\r\nplanter may find that rats or the rhinoceros beetle are the lesser\r\nevil, so should he be governed.\r\n\r\nThere are localities in the Archipelago where the plague of rats\r\nis unknown and where the beetles abound. In that case it would be\r\nunwise to disturb the leaves which are very tardily deciduous and\r\ndo not naturally fall till the wood beneath is hard, mature, and\r\npractically impervious to the attacks of insects.\r\n\r\nWhere rats are numerous and insects few, which is the case in some\r\nlocalities, the dead and dying leaves, among which the rat nests,\r\nmay be advantageously cleared away whenever the tree is climbed to\r\nharvest the fruit.\r\n\r\nAmong serious insect enemies we have to contend largely with the very\r\nobnoxious black beetle, Oryctes rhinocerus, and, fortunately, to a\r\nlesser extent, with Rhynchoporus ferrugineous (probably the same as\r\nR. ochreatus of Eydoux), while R. pascha, Boehm, and Chalcosma atlas,\r\nLinn., are also said to appear occasionally.\r\n\r\nHowever different their mode of attack, the general result is the\r\nsame, and their presence may surely be detected by the appearance of\r\ndeformed or badly misshapen or lacerated leaves.\r\n\r\nThe attacks of all species are confined to the growing point and as\r\nfar downward as the wood is tender and susceptible to the action of\r\ntheir powerful mandibles.\r\n\r\nThe black beetle makes its attacks when fully mature, eating its way\r\ninto the soft tissues and generally selecting the axil of a young\r\nleaf as the point of least resistance. Others simply deposit their\r\neggs, which hatch out, and the resulting grub is provided with jaws\r\npowerful enough to do the same mischief. Two or three of these grubs,\r\nif undisturbed, are sufficient in time to completely riddle the\r\ngrowing tip, which then falls over and the tree necessarily dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemedies may be described as preventive and aggressive, and, by an\r\nactive campaign of precaution, many subsequent remedial applications\r\ncan be avoided.\r\n\r\nMost of the beetles attacking the palm are known to select heaps of\r\ndecomposing rubbish and manure as their favorite (if not necessary)\r\nbreeding places, and it is obviously of importance to break up and\r\ndestroy such; nor can any better or more advantageous way of effecting\r\nthis be suggested than by promptly spreading and plowing under all such\r\naccumulations as fast as they are made; or, if this be impracticable,\r\nby forking or turning over or otherwise disturbing the heaps, until\r\nconvenient to dispose of them as first suggested.\r\n\r\nA truly preventive and simple remedy, and one that I can commend as a\r\nresult of close observation, is the application of a handful or two\r\nof sharp, coarse, clean sand in the axillæ of the young leaves. The\r\nnative practice is to mix this with ashes, salt, or tobacco dust;\r\nbut it is questionable if the efficacy of the remedy lies so much in\r\nthese additions as in the purely mechanical effect of the sand, the\r\nconstant attrition of which can not be other than highly objectionable\r\nto the insect while burrowing.\r\n\r\nOf offensive remedies, probing with a stout hooked wire is the only\r\nform of warfare carried on in these Islands; but, as the channel of the\r\nborer is sometimes tortuous and deep, this is not always effective. A\r\ncertain, simple, and easily applied remedy may be found in carbon\r\nbisulphid. It could be applied in the holes (which invariably trend\r\ndownward) with a small metal syringe. The hole should be sealed\r\nimmediately with a pinch of stiff, moist clay.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that this remedy and probing with a wire are the only\r\nsuccessful ways of combatting the red beetle, whose grub strikes in\r\nwherever it finds a soft spot; but, for these species which attack\r\nthe axils of the leaves, I have great faith in the efficacy of the\r\n\"sand cure,\" and no nut picker should go aloft unprovided with a small\r\nbamboo tube of dry, sifted sand, to protect the bases of recently\r\nexpanded leaves.\r\n\r\nIn Selangor cocoanut trees now come under the government inspection,\r\nand planters and owners, under penalties, are compelled to destroy\r\nthese pests. Mr. L. C. Brown, of Kuala Lampur, in that State,\r\nwho writes intelligently on this subject, [8] lays great stress on\r\nthe value of clean cultivation in subduing beetles, and repeats a\r\ncultural axiom that never grows old and that will, consequently,\r\nbear reiteration here--that it is rarely anything but the neglected\r\nplantation that suffers, and that the maintenance at all times of a\r\nhealthy, vigorous growth is in itself almost a guaranty of immunity\r\nfrom attacks of these pernicious insects.\r\n\r\nWhile we, unfortunately, know that this is not in all cases an assured\r\nprotection against diseases or insect enemies, it certainly minimizes\r\nthe danger and, in itself, is a justification of the high-pressure\r\ncultural treatment advocated throughout the preceding pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRENOVATION OF OLD GROVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaterial improvement of old plantations may sometimes be effected\r\nand, unless the trees are known to be upward of fifty years old,\r\ngenerally repays the labor. Marked increase in crop has followed a\r\nheavy thinning out of trees upon the Government cocoanut farm at San\r\nRamon, Mindanao. The improvement that a freer circulation of air and\r\nabundant sunlight have effected is very marked. Where it can be done,\r\nplowing is also sometimes feasible and should be followed by immediate\r\ncrop improvement. The average native plow is not so well adapted for\r\nworking over an old or neglected grove as it is for original soil\r\npreparation. It acts more as a subsoiler and will tear and lacerate\r\nmore roots than is desirable. A single carabao, or one-horse American\r\ngarden plow, is the better implement for this work. Extensive bat guano\r\ndeposits are found in Mindoro, Guimarás, and Luzon. Some of them show\r\nrichness in nitrogen and, when accessible at a moderate cost, would\r\nbe useful in the renovation of old groves, where the shade would be\r\nadverse to the rearing of good crops of nitrogen gatherers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. There are large areas throughout the littoral valleys of the\r\nArchipelago, as yet unexploited, which, in the essentials of soil,\r\nclimate, irrigation facilities, and general environment are suitable\r\nfor cocoanut growing.\r\n\r\n2. The present conditions present especially flattering attractions\r\nto cocoanut growers capable of undertaking the cultivation upon a\r\nscale of some magnitude. By coöperation, small estates could combine\r\nin the common ownership of machinery, whereby the products of the\r\ngrove could be converted into more profitable substances than copra.\r\n\r\n3. The present production of copra (estimated at 278,000 piculs in\r\n1902) is an assurance of a sufficient supply to warrant the erection\r\nof a high-class modern plant for the manufacture of the ultimate (the\r\n\"butter\") products of the nut. The products of such an enterprise would\r\nbe increased by the certainty of a local market in the Philippines for\r\nsome part of the output. The average market value of the best grades of\r\ncopra in the Marseilles market is $54.40, gold, per English ton. The\r\njobbing value on January 1 of this year, of the refined products,\r\nwere, for each ton of copra:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Butter fats              $90.00\r\n    Residual soap oils        21.00\r\n    Press cake                 5.20\r\n                             ------\r\n          Total              116.20\r\n\r\n\r\nthe difference representing the profit per ton, less the cost of\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\n4. The minimum size of a plantation, on which economical application\r\nof oil and fiber preparing machinery could be made, is 60 hectares.\r\n\r\n5. There is no other horticultural tropical product which may be grown\r\nin these Islands where crop assurance may be so nearly guaranteed,\r\nor natural conditions so nearly controlled by the planter who,\r\nknowing correct principles, has the facilities for applying them.\r\n\r\n6. The natural enemies and diseases of the plant are relatively few,\r\neasily held in check by vigilance and the exercise of competent\r\nbusiness management.\r\n\r\n7. The labor situation is bound more seriously to affect the small\r\nplanter, wholly dependent upon hand labor, than the estate conducted\r\non a large enough scale to justify the employment of modern machinery.\r\n\r\n8. In view of an ever-expanding demand for cocoanut products, and in\r\nthe light of the foregoing conclusions, the industry, when prosecuted\r\nupon a considerable scale and subject to the requirements previously\r\nset forth, promises for many years to be one of the most profitable\r\nand desirable enterprises which command the attention of the Filipino\r\nplanter.\r\n\r\nThe greatest mine of horticultural wealth which is open to the shrewd\r\nplanter lies in the heaps of waste and neglected husks that he can\r\nnow procure from adjoining estates for the asking and cartage.\r\n\r\nWith labor at 1 peso per diem and at the present price of potash and\r\nphosphoric acid, all the husks in excess of 300 per diem which could\r\nbe hauled would be clear profit. The ashes of these, when burned and\r\napplied to the old grove, would have an immediate and revivifying\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nMany trees in an old plantation have ceased to bear. Whether this is\r\ndue to exhaustion from old age or from soil exhaustion is immaterial;\r\neach should be eradicated and the time-honored custom of replanting\r\na fresh tree in its place abandoned. These renewals are difficult\r\nenough in any fruit or nut orchard where the scientific cultural\r\nconditions have been of the best. Renewals in a cocoanut grove,\r\nunless the vacant space is abnormally large and can be subjected to\r\nsome years of soil improvement, are unprofitable.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide range of opinion as to the bearing life of a cocoanut\r\ntree. It is said to vary from thirty to one hundred and thirty\r\nyears. Grown more than forty, or possibly fifty years old, the writer\r\nwould hesitate to undertake the improvement or renewal of the grove.\r\n\r\nPalms, unlike exogenous trees, afford no evidence by which their\r\nage may be determined. In general, with advanced years, come great\r\nheight and great attenuation. In the open, and where fully exposed\r\nto atmospheric influences, these form an approximate criterion of\r\nage. The so-called annular scars, marking the earlier attachments of\r\nleaves, furnish no clue to age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"The Prince of Palms,\" Treloar.\r\n\r\n[2] The cocoanut palm has been reared as far north as Indian River,\r\nFlorida, latitude 28° N., but has not proven a profitable commercial\r\nventure.\r\n\r\n[3] Quoted in \"Watts's Dict.,\" II, 456.\r\n\r\n[4] Bull.
