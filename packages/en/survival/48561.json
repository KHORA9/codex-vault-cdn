MEANING OF THE WORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we take a map of England and contrast it with a map of the\r\nUnited States, perhaps one of the first things we shall notice is\r\nthe dissimilarity of the arbitrary divisions of land of which the\r\ncountries are composed. In America the rigidly straight boundaries\r\nand rectangular shape of the majority of the States strike the eye\r\nat once; in England our wonder is rather how the boundaries have\r\ncome to be so tortuous and complicated--to such a degree, indeed,\r\nthat until recently many counties had outlying islands, as it were,\r\nwithin their neighbours' territory. We naturally infer that the\r\nconditions under which the divisions arose cannot have been the same,\r\nand that while in America these formal square blocks of land, like vast\r\nallotment gardens, were probably the creation of a central authority,\r\nand portioned off much about the same time, the divisions we find in\r\nEngland have no such simple origin. Such, in fact, is more or less\r\nthe case. The formation of the English counties in many instances was\r\n(and is--for they have altered up to to-day) an affair of slow growth,\r\nand their origin was--as their names tell us--of very diverse nature.\r\n\r\nLet us turn once more to our map of England. Collectively, we call all\r\nour divisions counties, but not every one of them is accurately thus\r\ndescribed. Some have names complete in themselves, such as Kent and\r\nSussex, and we find these to be old English kingdoms with but little\r\nalteration either in their boundaries or their names. To others the\r\nterminal shire is appended, which tells us that they were shorn from\r\na larger domain--shares of Mercia or Northumbria or some other of\r\nthe great English kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThe division of England into counties or shires has often been\r\nattributed to King Alfred (A.D. 871-901), but the shire of Berks\r\nis mentioned as early as the time of Ethelbert (A.D. 860-866), and\r\nBerkshire very probably existed as a county from the days of Egbert\r\n(died 836).\r\n\r\nThe words county and shire mean practically the same thing, but the\r\nformer is derived from the Latin comitatus through the French comté,\r\nthe dominion of a comes, or Count, and the latter from the Saxon scir\r\n(from sciran to divide). The termination \"shire\" is generally used for\r\nBerkshire and four of the neighbouring counties, viz. Buckinghamshire,\r\nOxfordshire, Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire. The next neighbouring\r\ncounty is usually called Hampshire, but in Acts of Parliament and\r\nofficial papers it is called the county of Southampton. For the\r\nremaining county, Surrey, the termination shire is not used: its\r\nname--Suthrege--tells us that it was \"the South Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nThe boundary of the county follows in great part the river Thames\r\nor its tributaries but in many places it is not distinguished from\r\nthe neighbouring counties by any natural features. On the west the\r\nchalk downs run from Wiltshire into Berkshire with no change at the\r\nboundary of the county, and on the south there is little distinction\r\nbetween the forest and moorland of Berkshire and of the adjoining\r\ntracts of Hampshire and Surrey.\r\n\r\nBerkshire has thus existed as a county for about 1100 years;\r\npreviously it was part of the Saxon kingdom of Wessex, which also\r\ncomprised Hampshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon, and part\r\nof Cornwall. The Saxons were called in by the Britons to assist them\r\nagainst the Picts and Scots (A.D. 429-449). This was a short time after\r\nthe departure of the Romans, A.D. 418, or nearly fifteen hundred years\r\nago. The Roman rule in our district may be taken as from A.D. 40 to\r\n418, a period of 378 years. We shall realise the length of their rule\r\nif we remember that 378 years ago Henry VIII was reigning in England.\r\n\r\nWhen the Romans came to the district they found it occupied by a tribe\r\nof Britons named the Atrebates; and Silchester, just over our county\r\nboundary in Hampshire, was their chief town or settlement.\r\n\r\nThe written history of the district does not go further back than the\r\nAtrebates, but we find many relics of man of a much earlier date. There\r\nare in our museums human bones found in old graves, but it is not\r\npossible to give them a date or to name the tribe or tribes to which\r\nthey belonged. There are also early gold coins without any inscription,\r\nbut bearing a rude figure of a horse not unlike the celebrated white\r\nhorse cut in the chalk hill above Uffington. These coins take us back\r\nto about B.C. 200. There are also various weapons and implements of\r\niron, bronze, and stone, found in graves or barrows or in the beds of\r\nour rivers, about which we shall say more in a subsequent chapter. All\r\nthese remains belong to a period when the surface of the county,\r\nthough no doubt covered to a great extent with forest, was not very\r\ndifferent from what it is to-day. The streams and rivers followed to\r\nsome extent the same courses and flowed at much the same level as now.\r\n\r\nBut there are remains of man which carry us back to a very much earlier\r\ndate. In what is known as the Palaeolithic Period our rivers flowed\r\nat much higher levels than now; possibly the land has risen since\r\nthat time, but however that may be, there are beds of gravel of the\r\nriver Thames as much as 114 feet above the present river, and these\r\ngravels contain implements made by man. These, which are at least\r\nas old as the gravel in which we find them, are nearly all of flint,\r\nand often beautifully made. A large collection from Berkshire is in\r\nthe Reading Museum.\r\n\r\nSeveral animals now extinct were living at that time. The mammoth,\r\nthe woolly rhinoceros, and the Irish elk roamed through the forest\r\nof Berkshire, and in all probability were hunted by Palaeolithic man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerkshire is an inland county separated from the English Channel by the\r\nfull width of Hampshire. The river Thames, however, gives a waterway\r\nto the sea, and the county town, Reading, is especially well served by\r\nrailways and has mainly on that account become the centre of trades of\r\ngreat importance. Reading biscuits and Reading seeds have a world-wide\r\ncelebrity, and printing is now extensively carried on in the town.\r\n\r\nBerkshire is, however, essentially an agricultural county, and some\r\nof the most fertile corn land in England is found in it. Until quite\r\nmodern times great tracts were waste, or woodland and moorland. But\r\nthese, though of no agricultural value, are for the most part very\r\ngood to live in and are now being rapidly built over.\r\n\r\nThe county is divided by nature into three well-marked districts. The\r\nfirst of these natural divisions is formed by the Vale of White Horse\r\nand the part of the county north of it, as well as the low-lying\r\nground between Wallingford and Steventon. The soil is clay and sand,\r\nand a few beds of limestone occur in places.\r\n\r\nThe second division is the great chalk district forming central\r\nBerkshire, with Ashbury, Wantage, and Wallingford on the north and\r\nHungerford, Kintbury, Chieveley, Bradfield, and Tilehurst on the\r\nsouth. The tract included in the curve of the river Thames between\r\nTwyford and Maidenhead also belongs to the chalk district. The chalk\r\nis not always at the surface of the ground, for it is often covered by\r\nthin beds of clay or gravel, but it will always be found at a little\r\ndepth below the surface in this district.\r\n\r\nThe third division comprises the forest country of the southern and\r\nsouth-eastern parts of the shire. Its northern boundary runs from\r\nInkpen in the west to Maidenhead in the east, but in places tracts\r\nnorth of this line belong to the third division and in other places\r\nthe chalk comes to the surface south of it. The soil in the third\r\ndivision consists of clay and sand with no limestone. These clays and\r\nsands are very thick in the south-east of the county, but everywhere\r\nthe chalk is below them if we go deep enough.\r\n\r\nThe chalk downs of the central division are dotted over with mounds\r\nand earthworks, probably for the most part the work of man before\r\nthe Roman occupation, for it was an inhabited part of the county in\r\nthe time of the Britons. On the other hand the Vale of White Horse\r\ndivision was in those days mainly or wholly uncultivated, but it is\r\nnow the most fertile part of Berkshire. The south or forest division\r\nhas been thinly populated up to quite modern times, though the Roman\r\ntown of Silchester stood in the Hampshire part of this forest country.\r\n\r\nBerkshire is almost all within the drainage area of the river Thames\r\nand its tributaries, and the natural line of communication between\r\nour county and the sea is by river, Windsor being some 85 miles from\r\nthe Nore.\r\n\r\nThe estuary of the Severn is less than 32 miles from Faringdon,\r\nand there seems to have been a tolerably good road from Berkshire to\r\nthe west coast in quite early times. Formerly a very usual line of\r\ncommunication between our county and the sea was from the south coast\r\nacross the chalk downs. Hungerford is only 35 miles from Southampton,\r\nand the roadways across the Chalk are very old and fairly direct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. SIZE. SHAPE. BOUNDARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe length of Berkshire on an east and west line is 41 miles. It may\r\nbe described as a rectangle with a somewhat square projection at the\r\nsouth-eastern corner. Ashmole compares it to a lute and Fuller to\r\na slipper. The northern boundary is practically formed by the river\r\nThames, and is in consequence most irregular. Where the river curves\r\nin a southerly direction, the width of the county is contracted until\r\nit is less than seven miles at Reading. Until 1844 Three Mile Cross\r\nand the country between that place and the Hampshire border was an\r\noutlying part of Wiltshire, so that the width of Berkshire at Reading\r\nwas less than four miles. This little bit of Wiltshire has however\r\nnow been joined to Berkshire.\r\n\r\nBerkshire as it is shown upon most maps is known as the \"Geographical\"\r\nor \"Ancient County\" of Berkshire, and its area is 462,208 acres,\r\nthat is about one-seventieth of the area of England.\r\n\r\nFor administrative purposes the boundaries are slightly different, and\r\nthe area of Administrative Berkshire including the county borough of\r\nReading is 462,367 acres. By deducting from this the area under water,\r\ni.e. rivers, ponds, lakes, etc., we arrive at the figures 459,403,\r\nwhich are used as the area of Berkshire in acres for the purpose of\r\nagricultural and other returns issued by Government. The county of\r\nBerks for registration purposes, that is for Parliamentary elections,\r\netc., includes all the Administrative County and also Egham in the\r\neast, Culham and Crowmarsh in the north-east, small bits of Oxfordshire\r\nand Gloucestershire in the north, and the rural district of Ramsbury\r\nin the west, giving a total area of 573,689 acres.\r\n\r\nBerkshire was, as we have said, a part of the Saxon kingdom of Wessex,\r\nand it has inherited from that kingdom its northern boundary, the\r\nriver Thames. It is interesting to note that some rivers have been\r\nselected as boundaries to a much greater extent than others. Thus\r\nthe Thames forms a county boundary for a great part of its course,\r\nwhilst the river Severn flows through the middle of counties.\r\n\r\nThe Thames forms the county boundary at Old Windsor from a point\r\na little above Magna Charta Island and separates Berkshire from\r\nBuckinghamshire, and later on from Oxfordshire, the boundary sometimes\r\nrunning in midstream, sometimes on one bank, and sometimes on the other\r\nbank. Near Oxford the boundary passes for a short distance a little\r\nto the west of the river, that is on the Berks side. The Upper Thames\r\nor Isis becomes the boundary between Berkshire and Oxfordshire, and\r\nthen for a very short distance between Berkshire and Gloucestershire,\r\nuntil near Buscot the river Cole joins the Isis and the boundary\r\nturns in a southerly direction near to the bank of the Cole, the\r\nadjoining county being then Wiltshire. The county boundary runs by\r\nor close to the river Cole to near Bourton, and it then crosses the\r\nchalk country with no definite marks. At one point it crosses an old\r\nearthwork, Membury Fort, and reaches the river Kennet a little east\r\nof Chilton Foliat. From this point to near Woodhay, a distance of\r\nsome 14 miles, the boundary of the county for administrative purposes\r\ndiffers from the boundary of the ancient or geographical county (see\r\npage 9), indeed considerable alterations have been made in this part\r\nof the county boundary at various times. The present administrative\r\nboundary after crossing the Kennet, turns in a westerly and then in\r\na south-easterly direction following the border of Hungerford and\r\nInkpen parishes and runs on to a point at the south-western corner\r\nof Combe parish where Berkshire, Wiltshire, and Hampshire meet. The\r\nBerkshire boundary then runs west to Pilot Hill and then turning\r\ntakes a northerly or north-easterly course until it reaches the\r\nstream Emborne which it follows for several miles until near Brimpton\r\nthe stream bends sharply northwards to join the river Kennet, while\r\nthe county boundary continues its easterly course through a forest\r\ncountry to the Imp Stone plantation. It then makes a wide detour to\r\nthe north leaving Mortimer West End and the Roman town of Silchester\r\nin Hampshire. This part of the boundary has at more than one date been\r\nsubject to alteration and for a time it ran close to Silchester and\r\nis thus marked on many maps. Stratfield Mortimer is in Berkshire, and\r\nabout a mile to the east of Silchester the county boundary reaches\r\na Roman road which it follows pretty closely for a considerable\r\ndistance, crossing the river Loddon at Stamford End Mill. On the east\r\nof the Loddon we come to a small tract which, until modern times,\r\nwas an outlying part of Wiltshire, bounded in part by Berkshire and\r\nin part by Hampshire. It is now included in the former county, and\r\nthe Berkshire boundary continues its easterly direction on or near\r\nthe Roman road until it reaches the stream Whitewater close to its\r\njunction with the Blackwater. The county boundary reaches the latter\r\nriver close to a ford, no doubt a well-known place, for these fords\r\nare in most cases very old crossing-places and this one certainly goes\r\nback to Roman times and may very likely have been used in still earlier\r\ndays. The boundary then turns along the Blackwater, and though it does\r\nnot always follow the present course of the stream, it keeps near to\r\nit for some eight miles, until we reach the Blackwater Bridge on the\r\nLondon and Southampton Road. This is another ancient crossing-place,\r\nand here the counties of Berkshire, Hampshire, and Surrey meet. The\r\nBerkshire and Surrey boundary now runs in a north-easterly direction,\r\nthrough the grounds of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, up a\r\nsmall stream to a place named Wishmoor Cross, possibly the site of\r\na cross in former days, and evidently a well-known place, for five\r\nparishes meet there. From this point the boundary crosses the forest\r\ndistrict of Bagshot Heath, celebrated in connection with highwaymen,\r\nand eventually reaches the Thames near Old Windsor.\r\n\r\nIn old maps it will be noticed that there are detached portions of\r\nBerkshire surrounded by Oxfordshire, and also detached portions of\r\nWiltshire partially or wholly surrounded by Berkshire, but in modern\r\ntimes the county boundaries have been much modified for purposes\r\nof convenience. Thus an Act of Parliament was passed in 1844 to\r\nannex detached parts of counties to the counties in which they are\r\nsituated. This Act transferred from Wiltshire to Berkshire parts of\r\nthe parishes of Shinfield, Swallowfield, and Wokingham. Shilton and\r\nLittle Faringdon were transferred from Berkshire to Oxfordshire, and\r\npart of Inglesham was given to Wiltshire. The boundaries of counties\r\nwere still further simplified by an Act of Parliament of 1887,\r\none of the objects of which was to arrange that no Union, Borough,\r\nSanitary District, or Parish should be in more than one county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SURFACE AND GENERAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned that Berkshire may be divided into three\r\nnatural divisions. The northern or Vale of White Horse district\r\nis for the most part rather low-lying ground, but there is a small\r\nrange of hills along the course of the Thames or Isis from Faringdon\r\ntowards Oxford. Badbury Hill, 530 feet above the sea, and Faringdon\r\nClump, 445 feet, are quite prominent from a distance, and some of\r\nthe other hills from Buckland to Wytham look imposing when seen from\r\nthe river. Much of this district was to a large extent swampy and\r\nboggy ground in old days, and a part of it is still spoken of as\r\n\"the moors\" by the country people. Some of the village names end in\r\n\"ey,\" suggesting that they were islands in the marsh district. Goosey\r\nand Charney are examples. A good deal of the district is stiff clay,\r\nand there is difficulty in getting a supply of good water, hence\r\nwe find a number of towns and villages, like Wantage for instance,\r\nclose to the chalk downs, where there are many springs.\r\n\r\nThe second or central division of Berkshire is the district of the\r\nchalk land. The downs of Berkshire are separated from the Chiltern\r\nHills, which are the chalk hills of Oxfordshire, by the valley of the\r\nriver Thames, whilst on the west the chalk downs run on into Wiltshire\r\nwithout any natural break. The chalk ridge rises sharply up from\r\nthe Vale of White Horse, and a large part of the crest is over 700\r\nfeet above the sea. White Horse Hill attains a height of 856 feet,\r\nand the village of Farnborough is 712 feet above sea level. There is\r\na general slope of the chalk surface downwards towards the south, so\r\nthat even the high part of Lambourn Downs is well below the 700-feet\r\ncontour line, and long and beautiful valleys run up from the Newbury\r\ndistrict into the chalk downs.\r\n\r\nThe northern border of the chalk district is a well defined line; not\r\nso the southern border. The chalk gradually bends downwards underground\r\nand is covered by sand, gravel, and clay, so that in many places we\r\nfind the upper part of the hills sandy or clayey whilst the valleys\r\nbeneath them are chalk. Thus Bussocks Camp and Snelsmore Common\r\nnear Newbury are situated upon a ridge of gravel, sand, and clay,\r\nbut the road from Chieveley to Newbury in the valley below the camp\r\nruns for most of the way along a chalk valley, and the chalk extends\r\nall around, but underneath the sand, gravel, and clay. Hence there\r\nis no definite southern boundary to the chalk district, and there is\r\na bit of chalk country near Inkpen. The projecting part of Berkshire,\r\nbounded on the south by a line drawn from Twyford to Maidenhead and on\r\nthe other sides by the river Thames, is also mainly a chalk district.\r\n\r\nThe southern division of the county has in consequence no definite\r\nnorthern border, but a line drawn from Hungerford in the west to\r\nMaidenhead in the east will have very little of chalk district\r\nto the south and very little forest country to the north, and is\r\nconsequently a good practical boundary between the second and third\r\ndivisions of Berkshire.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of the southern division is quite different from that of\r\nthe other two divisions. The country consists to a great extent of\r\nwide and flat table-land 300 to 400 feet above the sea, in which the\r\nrivers and streams have cut valleys. There are also extensive tracts of\r\nclay land, but the clay is often concealed under a few feet of gravel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. WATERSHED. RIVERS AND THEIR COURSES. LAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a small tract in the south-western corner the\r\ncounty is wholly drained by the river Thames and its tributaries;\r\nthat is to say, with a very few exceptions, every brook and stream\r\nin Berkshire is more or less directly a tributary of the Thames.\r\n\r\nThe river Thames or Isis becomes the boundary between Berkshire\r\nand Gloucestershire near Lechlade, and it flows in an easterly\r\ndirection over a clay country, keeping a little to the north of the\r\nridge of limestone hills upon which the villages of Buckland and\r\nHinton Waldrist stand. Near Appleton the river bends to the north,\r\ncurving round the outlying patch of limestone which forms Wytham\r\nHill, and being joined by the river Evenlode. The united streams\r\nsoon take a southerly course, and a little below Oxford are joined\r\non the north by the Cherwell. The river then crosses the limestone\r\nformation near Sandford, and curves round by Radley to Abingdon. From\r\nAbingdon the river pursues a somewhat serpentine course with a general\r\nsouth-easterly trend towards Benson, being joined on the north near\r\nDorchester by the river Thame. A little south of Benson the river,\r\nnow the Thames proper, enters upon the chalk formation, across which\r\nit flows in a southerly direction to Streatley, and then takes a\r\nsouth-easterly course to Reading. At Streatley the river valley is\r\ndeep, with steep sides separating the chalk downs of Berkshire from\r\nthe chalk hills known as the Chilterns. The illustration above shows\r\nthe Berkshire downs in the distance and the valley of the Thames in\r\nthe foreground.\r\n\r\nAt Reading the Thames is joined by the Kennet, and it is interesting\r\nto notice that the main stream adopts the direction of the tributary\r\nand flows with a north-easterly course to Wargrave, near which place\r\nthe river Loddon meets it from the south, and again the direction of\r\nflow of the tributary is adopted, the Thames taking a northerly course\r\npast Henley. It is also of interest to observe that the river has\r\nturned away from the soft clays which form the ground south and east\r\nof Reading, and has cut a deep valley in the hard chalk from Wargrave\r\nonwards. Beyond Remenham the course of the river becomes easterly,\r\nand near Cookham it turns south and flows past Maidenhead to Bray.\r\n\r\nNear Bray the Thames leaves the chalk over which it has flowed for\r\nsome 40 miles and enters upon a clay country, making its way in a\r\nfairly direct line to Windsor, the one place in the district where a\r\nknob of chalk sticks up through the clay. Windsor Castle stands upon\r\nthis knob of chalk. The course of the river from Bray to Windsor is on\r\nthe whole south-east, and after a big curve north at Eton the course\r\nbecomes more southerly, with another big curve near Old Windsor. At\r\nRunnymede House the Berkshire boundary leaves the river, which flows\r\non to London and the sea.\r\n\r\nThe river Cole rises on the chalk not far from Ashbury, and flowing\r\nin a northerly direction joins the Upper Thames or Isis at the extreme\r\nwestern boundary of the county.\r\n\r\nThe river Ock rises on the chalk near Uffington, and flows down the\r\nVale of White Horse to join the Thames at Abingdon.\r\n\r\nThe river Pang rises on the chalk not far from Compton, and flows in\r\na southerly direction to near Bucklebury, where it turns eastward,\r\npassing through a beautiful valley by way of Stanford Dingley and\r\nBradfield to a point near Tidmarsh. It then makes a sharp turn to\r\nthe north and joins the Thames at Pangbourne. This lower part of the\r\ncourse of the Pang is worthy of study, for there is a continuous band\r\nof river alluvium along the valley from the Thames at Pangbourne to\r\nthe Kennet at Theale. The source of the river, too, is well worthy\r\nof investigation. In dry times it will be found in the valley near\r\nCompton, but in wet seasons it is much further up in a branch valley\r\ntowards East Ilsley.\r\n\r\nThe Lambourn also rises on the chalk near the place of that name,\r\nand it flows in a south-easterly direction and joins the Kennet close\r\nto Newbury. The Pang and the Lambourn flow in chalk valleys for the\r\nwhole of their course.\r\n\r\nThe river Kennet rises in Wiltshire, enters Berkshire near Hungerford,\r\nand flows with an easterly course by way of Kintbury, Newbury, and\r\nTheale, finally joining the Thames close to Reading. It is a chalk\r\nriver, and obtains a considerable amount of water from springs in\r\nthe valley along its course.\r\n\r\nThe Emborne is not a chalk stream. It rises in the Inkpen district\r\nand flows in an easterly direction, forming, as we have seen, the\r\ncounty boundary for a considerable distance. Its course is almost\r\nparallel to that of the river Kennet, the two valleys being separated\r\nby hills or plateaux of clay, sand, and gravel. Near Brimpton the\r\nEmborne turns sharply to the north-east, and joins the river Kennet\r\nnear Sulhampstead Bannister.\r\n\r\nThe Foudry Brook rises in a clay district of Hampshire, not far from\r\nSilchester, and runs by way of Stratfield Mortimer and Grazeley to\r\nthe river Kennet near Reading. It is a small stream now, but there\r\nis a good deal of alluvium along its course, showing that it was of\r\nmore importance in former times.\r\n\r\nThe river Loddon rises in Hampshire and enters Berkshire at the edge\r\nof Strathfieldsaye Park, its direction being northerly. Soon, however,\r\nit turns to the north-east and flows in a tolerably straight line to\r\njoin the river Thames near Wargrave.\r\n\r\nThe Blackwater rises near Aldershot and reaches Berkshire at Blackwater\r\nBridge, where, as we have said, the counties of Berkshire, Hampshire,\r\nand Surrey meet. From this point the river flows in a north-west or\r\nwest direction and forms the Berkshire boundary for eight miles to a\r\npoint near Little Ford below Farley Hill. The Blackwater then turns\r\ninto Berkshire, running in a north-westerly direction to Swallowfield,\r\nwhere it joins the river Loddon.\r\n\r\nThere are no natural lakes in Berkshire, though there are the deposits\r\nof a former lake in the valley of the Kennet near Newbury.\r\n\r\nThere was formerly a sheet of water near Twyford named Ruscombe Lake,\r\nwhich had some claim to be called a natural lake, in that it was a\r\nlow-lying bit of ground which was flooded owing to the absence of a\r\ngood outlet. Its natural outlet was into the river Loddon, and there\r\nis a patch of alluvium extending from its site through Stanlake Park\r\nto that river. It was eventually drained by making a deep channel\r\ncalled the \"Cut,\" draining a considerable area into the Thames near\r\nBray. It has been asked why the river Thames did not follow the line of\r\nRuscombe Lake and the Bray Cut, all soft clayey soil and low ground,\r\ninstead of cutting the great and deep valley through the chalk by way\r\nof Wargrave, Henley, Great Marlow, and Maidenhead. The explanation\r\nprobably is that the river Thames existed before any of these valleys,\r\nand that its course was determined by local features which have long\r\nsince been destroyed by rain and streams, and by the river itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. GEOLOGY AND SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore giving further account of the physical geography of the county\r\nit is necessary to learn somewhat of its geology, as the physical\r\nconditions are to a large extent dependent upon geological structure.\r\n\r\nBy Geology we mean the study of the rocks, and we must at the outset\r\nexplain that the term rock is used by the geologist without any\r\nreference to the hardness or compactness of the material to which the\r\nname is applied; thus he speaks of loose sand as a rock equally with\r\na hard substance like granite.\r\n\r\nRocks are of two kinds, (1) those laid down mostly under water;\r\n(2) those due to the action of heat.\r\n\r\nThe first kind may be compared to sheets of paper one over the\r\nother. These sheets are called beds, and such beds are usually formed\r\nof sand (often containing pebbles), mud or clay, and limestone, or\r\nmixtures of these materials. They are laid down as flat or nearly\r\nflat sheets, but may afterwards be tilted as the result of movement\r\nof the earth's crust, just as you may tilt sheets of paper, folding\r\nthem into arches and troughs, by pressing them at either end. Again,\r\nwe may find the tops of the folds so produced worn away as the result\r\nof the constant action of rivers, glaciers, and sea-waves upon them,\r\nas one might cut off the tops of the folds of the paper with a pair\r\nof shears. This has happened with the ancient beds forming parts\r\nof the earth's crust, and we therefore often find them tilted, with\r\nthe upper parts removed. Tilted beds are said to dip, the direction\r\nof dip being that in which the beds plunge downwards, thus the beds\r\nof an arch dip away from its crest, those of a trough towards its\r\nmiddle. The dip is at a low angle when the beds are nearly horizontal,\r\nand at a high angle when they approach the vertical position. The\r\nhorizontal line at right angles to the direction of the dip is called\r\nthe line of strike. Beds form strips at the surface, and the portion\r\nwhere they appear at the surface is called the outcrop. On a large\r\nscale the direction of outcrop generally corresponds with that of the\r\nstrike. Beds may also be displaced along great cracks, so that one\r\nset of beds abuts against a different set at the sides of the crack,\r\nwhen the beds are said to be faulted.\r\n\r\nThe other kinds of rocks are known as igneous rocks, which have been\r\nmelted under the action of heat and become solid on cooling. When in\r\nthe molten state they have been poured out at the surface as the lava\r\nof volcanoes, or have been forced into other rocks and cooled in the\r\ncracks and other places of weakness. Much material is also thrown out\r\nof volcanoes as volcanic ash and dust, and is piled up on the sides\r\nof the volcano. Such ashy material may be arranged in beds, so that it\r\npartakes to some extent of the qualities of the two great rock groups.\r\n\r\nThe production of beds is of great importance to geologists, for by\r\nmeans of these beds we can classify the rocks according to age. If\r\nwe take two sheets of paper, and lay one on the top of the other on\r\na table, the upper one has been laid down after the other. Similarly\r\nwith two beds, the upper is also the newer, and the newer will remain\r\non the top after earth-movements, save in very exceptional cases\r\nwhich need not be regarded by us here, and for general purposes we\r\nmay regard any bed or set of beds resting on any other in our own\r\ncountry as being the newer bed or set.\r\n\r\nThe movements which affect beds may occur at different times. One set\r\nof beds may be laid down flat, then thrown into folds by movement, the\r\ntops of the beds worn off, and another set of beds laid down upon the\r\nworn surface of the older beds, the edges of which will abut against\r\nthe oldest of the new set of flatly deposited beds, which latter may\r\nin turn undergo disturbance and removal of their upper portions.\r\n\r\nAgain, after the formation of the beds many changes may occur in\r\nthem. They may become hardened, pebble-beds being changed into\r\nconglomerates, sands into sandstones, muds and clays into mudstones\r\nand shales, soft deposits of lime into limestone, and loose volcanic\r\nashes into exceedingly hard rocks. They may also become cracked,\r\nand the cracks are often very regular, running in two directions at\r\nright angles one to the other. Such cracks are known as joints, and\r\nthe joints are very important in affecting the physical geography\r\nof a district. As the result of great pressure applied sideways,\r\nthe rocks may be so changed that they can be split into thin slabs,\r\nwhich usually, though not necessarily, split along planes standing at\r\nhigh angles to the horizontal. Rocks affected in this way are known\r\nas slates.\r\n\r\nIf we could flatten out all the beds of England, and arrange them\r\none over the other and bore a shaft through them, we should see\r\nthem on the sides of the shaft, the newest appearing at the top and\r\nthe oldest at the bottom. Such a shaft would have a depth of between\r\n50,000 and 100,000 feet. The beds are divided into three great groups\r\ncalled Primary or Palaeozoic, Secondary or Mesozoic, and Tertiary or\r\nCainozoic, and at the base of the Primary rocks are the oldest rocks\r\nof Britain, which form as it were the foundation stones on which the\r\nother rocks rest, and are termed Precambrian rocks. The three great\r\ngroups are divided into minor divisions known as systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n     NAMES OF         SUBDIVISIONS                    CHARACTERS OF ROCKS\r\n     SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n   {                { Metal Age Deposits            }\r\n   { Recent         { Neolithic     ,,              } Superficial Deposits\r\n   { Pleistocene    { Palaeolithic  ,,              }\r\n   {                { Glacial       ,,              }\r\nT  {\r\nE  {                { Cromer Series                 }\r\nR  {                { Weybourne Crag                }\r\nT  { Pliocene       { Chillesford and Norwich Crags } Sands chiefly\r\nI  {                { Red and Walton Crags          }\r\nA  {                { Coralline Crag                }\r\nR  {\r\nY  { Miocene          Absent from Britain\r\n   {\r\n   {                { Fluviomarine Beds of Hampshire}\r\n   {                { Bagshot Beds                  }\r\n   { Eocene         { London Clay                   } Clays and Sands\r\n   {                { Oldhaven Beds, Woolwich and   } chiefly\r\n   {                {   Reading Groups              }\r\n   {                { Thanet Sands                  }\r\n\r\n   {                { Chalk                         }\r\n   { Cretaceous     { Upper Greensand and Gault     } Chalk at top\r\n   {                { Lower Greensand               } Sandstones, Mud and\r\n   {                { Weald Clay                    } Clays below\r\n   {                { Hastings Sands                }\r\n   {\r\n   {                { Purbeck Beds                  }\r\nS  {                { Portland Beds                 }\r\nE  {                { Kimmeridge Clay               }\r\nC  {                { Corallian Beds                }\r\nO  { Jurassic       { Oxford Clay and Kellaways Rock} Shales, Sandstones\r\nN  {                { Cornbrash                     } and Oolitic\r\nD  {                { Forest Marble                 } Limestones\r\nA  {                { Great Oolite with Stonesfield }\r\nR  {                {   Slate                       }\r\nY  {                { Inferior Oolite               }\r\n   {                { Lias--Upper, Middle, and Lower}\r\n   {\r\n   {                { Rhaetic                       }\r\n   {                { Keuper Marls                  }\r\n   { Triassic       { Keuper Sandstone              } Red Sandstones and\r\n   {                { Upper Bunter Sandstone        } Marls, Gypsum and\r\n   {                { Bunter Pebble Beds            } Salt\r\n   {                { Lower Bunter Sandstone        }\r\n\r\n   {                { Magnesian Limestone and       }\r\n   { Permian        { Sandstone                     } Red Sandstones and\r\n   {                { Marl Slate                    } Magnesian Limestone\r\n   {                { Lower Permian Sandstone       }\r\n   {\r\n   {                { Coal Measures                 } Sandstones, Shales\r\n   { Carboniferous  { Millstone Grit                } and Coals at top\r\n   {                { Mountain Limestone            } Sandstones in middle\r\n   {                { Basal Carboniferous Rocks     } Limestone and Shales\r\n   {                {                               } below\r\n   {\r\n   {                { Upper  }                      } Red Sandstones,\r\n   { Devonian       { Mid    } Devonian and Old     } Shales, Slates and\r\nP  {                { Lower  } Red Sandstone        } Limestones\r\nR  {\r\nI  {                { Ludlow Beds                   } Sandstones, Shales\r\nM  { Silurian       { Wenlock Beds                  } and Thin Limestones\r\nA  {                { Llandovery Beds               }\r\nR  {\r\nY  {                { Caradoc Beds                  } Shales, Slates,\r\n   { Ordovician     { Llandeilo Beds                } Sandstones and\r\n   {                { Arenig Beds                   } Thin Limestones\r\n   {\r\n   {                { Tremadoc Slates               }\r\n   { Cambrian       { Lingula Flags                 } Slates and\r\n   {                { Menevian Beds                 } Sandstones\r\n   {                { Harlech Grits and Llanberis   }\r\n   {                { Slates\r\n   {\r\n   {                                                { Sandstones,\r\n   { Pre-Cambrian     No definite classification    { Slates and\r\n   {                  yet made                      { Volcanic Rocks\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding table (p. 29) a representation of the various great\r\nsubdivisions or 'systems' of the beds which are found in the British\r\nIslands is shown. The names of the great divisions are given on the\r\nleft-hand side, in the centre the chief divisions of the rocks of each\r\nsystem are enumerated, and on the right-hand the general characters\r\nof the rocks of each system are given.\r\n\r\nBerkshire is now part of an island and is a long way from the sea,\r\nbut there have been times when the arrangement of land and sea on\r\nthe globe was very different from what it is now. Our district has\r\nduring some periods been part of a continent, and in others it has\r\nbeen overflowed by the sea.\r\n\r\nThese changes in the distribution of land and water were due to\r\nmovements of the crust of the earth, and very largely to movements\r\nof compression from the sides, causing folding of the strata of which\r\nthe crust of the earth is composed.\r\n\r\nAfter many and great changes, at a time geologically recent, but\r\nstill long before the beginning of history in the usual sense of the\r\nword, the district now known as Berkshire rose above the sea for the\r\nlast time.\r\n\r\nSince that date deposits of clay, sand, etc., have been formed in our\r\narea, and their formation is indeed still going on to some extent,\r\nbut though these are true geological deposits they are of no great\r\nthickness, seldom as much as 20 feet. They are, however, at or near\r\nthe surface of the ground, and consequently exercise considerable\r\ninfluence on the character of the country. We will, however, leave\r\nthem out of account for the moment and consider the deposits formed\r\nbefore the district finally rose above the sea.\r\n\r\nThese deposits are usually spoken of as forming the solid geology\r\nof the area, and the three divisions, into which as we have said\r\nBerkshire is divided, are characterised as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  In the northern part of the county, including the Vale of White\r\n    Horse, the geological strata are older than the chalk formation.\r\n2.  In the central part of Berkshire the chalk formation is at or\r\n    near the surface of the ground.\r\n3.  In the forest country of south and east Berkshire, the surface\r\n    is formed of geological formations newer than the chalk, but the\r\n    chalk is always to be found underground if one goes deep enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we look at a sectional plan of geological strata we shall see that\r\nnone of the formations which come to the surface in our county are\r\nof any great antiquity, but somewhere deep down, say over a thousand\r\nfeet below us, there is a platform of much older rocks, upon which\r\nthose that come to the surface rest in an irregular manner. What these\r\nold rocks may be we do not know, but probably New Red Sandstone and\r\npossibly beds of coal may occur amongst them.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, we pass from older to newer geological formations\r\nas we go from the north-west towards the south-east, and we find that\r\nthe Oxford Clay is the oldest formation which comes to the surface\r\nin Berkshire.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford Clay forms a strip of low land along the banks of the Isis\r\nfrom the Cole to the Cherwell near Oxford. It was originally mud\r\ndeposited in a sea which extended over a great part of England. It\r\nis dark coloured, often shaley, with a little clayey limestone. A\r\nlarge oyster is one of its common fossils. Its thickness is about 450\r\nfeet, and it is not a water-bearing formation. The Oxford Clay dips\r\nunderground to the east and is covered by newer rocks, the first of\r\nwhich is the Corallian.\r\n\r\nThe Corallian forms a very well-marked band running across the\r\ncounty from the Cole to the Thames. Wytham Hill is formed of it, and\r\nShrivenham, Coleshill, Faringdon, Buckland, Fyfield, Appleton, and\r\nCumnor are situated upon it. It is essentially a calcareous formation\r\nwith some hard limestone beds, and has a thickness of from 50 to 80\r\nfeet. It was formed in the sea; probably a shallow sea with shoals,\r\nsand, and coral banks. Fossil corals are abundant, and many specimens\r\nof Ammonites and other marine shells are to be found. There are some\r\ngood examples of these from Marcham in the Reading Museum. Supplies\r\nof good water may often be obtained from this formation. The Corallian\r\nbeds are quarried for building stone and road material in many places.\r\n\r\nThe Kimmeridge Clay, which comes above the Corallian, is, like the\r\nOxford Clay, a bed of hardened marine mud. It has now become a shaley\r\nclay, and is about 140 feet thick. It forms a narrow east and west band\r\nacross the county. Much of the Vale of White Horse is on this clay,\r\nand the town of Abingdon stands upon it. It is not a water-bearing\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe Portland Beds. A small patch of this formation is found resting\r\nupon the Kimmeridge Clay in Berkshire. It caps the rising ground\r\nsouth of Shrivenham, and the village of Bourton stands upon it. Its\r\nthickness is about 20 feet.\r\n\r\nAfter the deposition of the Portland rocks, which are of marine origin,\r\nthere is reason to believe that our district became land and a part\r\nof a continent, but no relics of this period remain here. They were\r\nall swept away when the land sank again and the Cretaceous sea flowed\r\nover Berkshire.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Greensand--our next deposit--was formed after a long\r\ninterval, and, owing to earth movements which had taken place during\r\nthat interval, it rests upon the older rocks in an irregular manner. It\r\nis a marine formation, and only occurs in patches, the largest of which\r\nextends from Uffington to near Faringdon. Its greatest thickness is\r\nabout 60 feet, and it consists of sand with some ironstone and chert,\r\npebble beds, and a calcareous sponge gravel. The sponge gravel,\r\nso-called from the number of fossil sponges it contains, is dug for\r\ngarden paths and walks, and is exported to long distances. The fossil\r\nsponges in the gravel are abundant and beautifully preserved, and\r\nthey seem to have lived on the spot. The ironstone was at one time\r\nworked near Faringdon. At New Lodge, in the parish of Winkfield, the\r\nLower Greensand was reached in a boring at a depth of 1234 feet. A\r\ngood supply of water was obtained, but it contains a large quantity\r\nof common salt.\r\n\r\nThe Gault, the next formation, consists of grey clay in the lower part\r\nand of a silty marl in the upper part, with a total thickness of some\r\n220 feet. It crosses the county as a band, from one to three miles in\r\nwidth, from Ashbury to the Thames between Abingdon and Wallingford. It\r\nis a marine formation, and does not give a water-supply.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Greensand runs across the county as a narrow and irregular\r\nband about 90 feet thick, and consists of green sands and grey marl,\r\nwith beds of stone in places. It is of marine origin, and provides\r\na supply of excellent water, and consequently many villages stand\r\nupon or close to it. Ashbury, Childrey, Wantage, Hendred, and Harwell\r\nare examples.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk. This is far the most important geological formation in\r\nBerkshire, for it occupies a large portion of the surface of the\r\ncounty, and in the eastern part, when not at the surface, it is to be\r\nfound underground. It is a light-coloured limestone, usually soft and\r\nearthy, but in parts very hard. Its full thickness is over 700 feet,\r\nand being a porous rock, the rain which falls on its great surface\r\nsinks in and furnishes a water-supply over its whole area whether the\r\nchalk be at the surface or underground. It was deposited in a sea which\r\nnot only covered our district but spread over much of Europe. There\r\nwas, however, probably land to the west which included Cornwall,\r\nparts of Wales, and of Ireland. The upper part of the Berkshire Chalk\r\ncontains many layers and nodules of flint.\r\n\r\nThere is a long break in our geological record after the newest beds\r\nof the Chalk found in Berkshire had been deposited, for both the top\r\nof the Chalk and the bottom of the next series are wanting here, and\r\nin order to fill the interval we have to study rocks in other parts\r\nof England, in Belgium, and in Denmark. During this great interval\r\nin time the chalk sea retired, and much of Britain became land.\r\n\r\nThe Reading Beds repose upon a water- and weather-worn surface of\r\nchalk. They consist of clays and sands, and were deposited in the bed\r\nof a great river. Their thickness is from 70 to 90 feet, and good\r\nwater may be obtained from the sands. In the lower part we find a\r\nbed of oysters, and rather higher up there is in some places a bed\r\nof leaves, known as the \"Reading Leaf-Bed,\" a specimen of which is\r\nshown below. It will be noticed that the leaves are crowded together,\r\nand were no doubt buried in the mud of the river.\r\n\r\nThe Basement Bed of the London Clay comes next in order and the fossils\r\nare marine, showing that the sea was again spreading over our area. It\r\nis from 6 to 16 feet in thickness, and consists of loam and clay with\r\ngreen sand and pebbles. A set of shells from this bed is arranged in\r\nthe Reading Museum.\r\n\r\nThe London Clay is a marine formation of very uniform character,\r\na stiff clay, blue underground, but becoming brown near the\r\nsurface, owing to the action of surface water. It contains layers of\r\ncement-stones. The thickness in the east of the county is nearly 350\r\nfeet, but the formation thins to the west, and is under 50 feet thick\r\nat Inkpen. Fossils are not uncommon, and there is a fair collection\r\nof Berkshire London Clay fossils in the Wellington College Museum. It\r\nis not a water-bearing formation. Most of Windsor Park is on London\r\nClay, and a number of places the names of which end with \"field\"\r\nare upon this formation, such as Arborfield, Binfield, Burghfield,\r\nShinfield, Swallowfield, Warfield, and Winkfield.\r\n\r\nThe Bagshot Beds, named after Bagshot Heath, consist of sand with\r\na few beds of clay. The maximum thickness is nearly 350 feet. They\r\nare probably mainly of marine origin, but formed near the estuary\r\nof a large river. Fossils are rare in this formation in Berkshire,\r\nbut a few specimens will be found in the Museums at Reading and at\r\nWellington College. The Bagshot Beds are a water-bearing formation,\r\nbut the water is not always of a satisfactory character. The scenery\r\nof the sandy Bagshot country is well shown by the view opposite.\r\n\r\nSome indefinite time after the deposition of the Bagshot Beds\r\nconsiderable earth movements took place in the south of England,\r\nand Berkshire became, and has since remained, dry land. The Bagshot\r\nBeds are consequently the last marine formation in our district,\r\nand we thus complete our account of the solid geology of the county.\r\n\r\nThe solid strata are, however, to a considerable extent covered\r\nwith a variety of geological deposits due to rain, frost, streams,\r\nand rivers. These deposits, often termed Drift, though not marked\r\non the majority of geological maps, have a great importance for the\r\ndwellers in our county, simply because they form the actual surface\r\nand determine the character of the soil.\r\n\r\nClay with Flints is a formation covering a good deal of our Chalk. It\r\nis partly débris of the chalk formation and partly of clay beds which\r\nonce rested on the Chalk. In places it is 20 feet thick. Some of the\r\nbest timber in the county grows upon it.\r\n\r\nGravel covers a good deal of the surface in Berkshire. It is found\r\nboth on the high ground and in the valleys. The high-level gravels\r\nare often over 10 feet thick and the valley gravels are more than 20\r\nfeet thick in several places. Windsor, Bray, Maidenhead, Cookham,\r\nTwyford, Wokingham, Reading, Theale, Pangbourne, and Newbury stand\r\npartly or wholly upon gravel.\r\n\r\nAlluvium, the modern deposit of the rivers, covers a good deal of\r\nground in some places, more especially in the valley of the Kennet.\r\n\r\nSarsens are blocks of sandstone which are found on or near the\r\nsurface of the ground or in the beds of gravel. They were probably\r\nderived in part from the Reading Beds and in part from the Bagshot\r\nBeds. The illustration on page 40 shows three sarsen stones lying\r\nat the bottom of a thick bed of gravel in a gravel pit on Chobham\r\nRidges. The locality is in Surrey, but not far from the Berkshire\r\nborder, and similar examples occur in Berkshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fertile district of the Vale of White Horse, the wide chalk downs,\r\nand the forest country with its sandy tracts covered by heather or\r\npines, together with the river Thames and its tributaries, give us a\r\nconsiderable variety of soil, of climate, and of general conditions;\r\nand we consequently have a large variety of species both of animals\r\nand of plants, though being an inland county, many forms which people\r\nthe coast are absent, or merely come as rare visitors. Naturally, too,\r\nthe increase of population and the advance of civilisation have caused\r\na great change in animal and plant life. Many species, once common,\r\nare no longer to be found and many new species have been introduced.\r\n\r\nProbably the most imposing of the animals which have roamed over\r\nour district since the advent of man was the form of elephant known\r\nas the mammoth. It possessed enormous tusks and was covered with\r\nlong coarse hair with an under pelage of short woolly hair so as to\r\nbe fitted for life in a cold climate. Its bones have been found in\r\nseveral places in Berkshire, and teeth from Abingdon and Reading are\r\nin the Reading Museum.\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceros once lived in Berkshire, for bones, probably belonging\r\nto a woolly species, have been found in a railway cutting near\r\nChilton. Bones of the bear, wolf, and bison have been found in\r\nthe Drift deposits, and the wild boar was hunted in Berkshire in\r\nhistoric times.\r\n\r\nThe badger is a harmless animal which lives a quiet life, spending\r\nthe daytime in a burrow, often in a fox earth, and only coming out\r\nat night. It is in consequence much more common than is generally\r\nsupposed, and our county forms no exception.\r\n\r\nThe history of the various forms of deer in Berkshire is of\r\nconsiderable interest. The red deer is a native of the county, for\r\nits remains have been found in the marsh deposits. It lived in various\r\nparks until the Commonwealth, when most of the deer were killed. It has\r\nbeen reintroduced and is now to be seen in Windsor Park, Calcot Park,\r\nand at Hampstead Marshall. The fallow deer lives in a more or less tame\r\nstate in several parks in the county, and it is probably an original\r\ninhabitant of Berkshire, for it occurs as a fossil at Brentford, in\r\nMiddlesex. The roe is certainly a native, for remains have been found\r\nin the Newbury marshes. It now lives in the woods about Virginia Water\r\nand Sunningdale. The reindeer has been found as a fossil at Windsor.\r\n\r\nAn imperfect skull of the musk ox was found in a bed of gravel near\r\nMaidenhead in 1855, and is now in the Natural History Museum at South\r\nKensington. It was the first discovery of the remains of this animal\r\nin Britain.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected there are no very outstanding features in\r\nBerkshire ornithology. The midland position of the county is against\r\nany long list of foreign visitors, and there are no fens or broads\r\nto tempt the special birds affecting such localities. The heron\r\nis often to be seen, and there is a heronry at Virginia Water, and\r\nothers at Coley Park, Buscot, and Wytham Abbey. Woodpeckers, as might\r\nbe supposed, are more especially common in the forest districts of\r\neastern Berkshire. The carrion crow is a resident but is very local in\r\noccurrence. The hooded crow is a rather uncommon winter visitor. The\r\nperegrine falcon often visits us, but the buzzard, which used to\r\nlive and breed in the county, is now but a rare visitor. The great\r\nbustard was a resident up to the end of the eighteenth century but\r\nis now no longer to be counted as a British bird. The swans which we\r\nsee on the rivers and on many lakes and ponds are for the most part\r\nprivate property, but there are often wild birds amongst them.\r\n\r\nOf reptiles found in Berkshire, the slow-worm, common snake, and\r\nlizard abound on the moorlands, and the first of these on the chalk;\r\nthe adder is not at all common.\r\n\r\nTime was, and that not so very long ago, when the salmon might be\r\ncaught in the Thames. In the reign of Edward III (1341), a petition\r\nwas made to the King, complaining that salmon and other fish in the\r\nThames were taken and destroyed by engines placed to catch the fry,\r\nwhich were then used for feeding pigs. The King was asked to forbid\r\nthe use of these engines between London and the sea, and also to\r\ndecree that no salmon be taken between Gravesend and Henley bridge in\r\nwinter. A book on angling published in 1815 speaking of salmon says,\r\n\"some are found in the Thames which the writer believes were justly\r\nconsidered to be superior to any bred in other rivers.\"\r\n\r\nIn recent years an attempt has been made to reintroduce the salmon\r\ninto the Thames, and many young salmon have been turned out in the\r\nriver, but so far without any useful result.\r\n\r\nBut though the salmon has been, and again may be an inhabitant of\r\nthe Thames, the brown trout is, and always has been, the fish of\r\nBerkshire. It attains a large size, and fish of from 8 to 12 lbs. are\r\nfrequently caught in the Thames. There is, however, a scarcity of\r\nsuitable breeding-places for trout in the river, and the stock,\r\nduring recent years, has been kept up by introducing young fish, and\r\nnot only brown trout but also Lochleven trout and rainbow trout have\r\nbeen turned into the river in great numbers. Many of the tributaries\r\nof the Thames are excellent trout streams, the Lambourn being a\r\nparticularly good one.\r\n\r\nThe pike is found in the rivers and in many a lake and pond throughout\r\nBerkshire. Grayling occur in the Kennet and are occasionally caught\r\nin the Thames. The gudgeon is a well-known Thames fish; and perch,\r\nroach, dace, barbel and minnows abound. The little ruff or pope is\r\nfairly common in the Thames, and the miller's thumb, another small\r\nfish belonging to the cooler parts of the world, is to be seen in most\r\nof our streams darting from place to place with great rapidity. The\r\nrudd, which is generally distributed through the more level part of\r\nEngland, is not common in Berkshire. The bream is occasionally caught\r\nin the Thames, but it is not a native and was probably introduced\r\nfrom Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThe great variety of soil found in the river valleys, on the chalk\r\ndowns, and in the forest district gives rise to much difference in\r\nthe vegetation in different parts of the county. The beds of bullrush,\r\nthe yellow and purple loosestrife, and the white and yellow water-lily\r\nare intimately associated with the beauty of the Thames.\r\n\r\nThe ling, the bell heather, and the cross-leaved heath cover large\r\ntracts in the eastern part of the county, and the bilberry is found\r\nin the woods of the same district. The bramble abounds in the forest\r\nparts, and of cultivated fruits we have large orchards of plums and\r\ncherries in the northern part of the county. Some rare orchids are\r\nto be found on the chalk, and in the peat districts the interesting\r\nlittle sundew is quite common.\r\n\r\nIn the chalk district the holly and beech grow well, and fine oaks are\r\nto be seen in many parts of our county. Herne's Oak, in Windsor Park,\r\nhas given rise to much discussion, but there can be little doubt that\r\nthe tree known by that name to Shakespeare was cut down in 1796. There\r\nare some avenues of fine elms in Windsor Park--notably the Long Walk.\r\n\r\nOf the conifers, the yew is a native of our district and grows well on\r\nthe chalk, and the so-called Scotch fir (in reality a pine), a native\r\nof Scotland, has been introduced and forms extensive woods in the sandy\r\nparts of the county. The cedar of Lebanon, various kinds of cypress,\r\nthe araucaria of Chile, the cryptomeria of Japan and the Wellingtonia\r\n(Sequoia) of California have been introduced into the county. On\r\nthe opposite page is a view of an avenue of the Wellingtonia near\r\nWellington College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. CLIMATE AND RAINFALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate of a country or district is, briefly, the average weather\r\nof that country or district, and it depends upon various factors,\r\nall mutually interacting, upon the latitude, the temperature, the\r\ndirection and strength of the winds, the rainfall, the character of\r\nthe soil, and the proximity of the district to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe differences in the climates of the world depend mainly upon\r\nlatitude, but a scarcely less important factor is proximity to the\r\nsea. Along any great climatic zone there will be found variations\r\nin proportion to this proximity, the extremes being \"continental\"\r\nclimates in the centres of continents far from the oceans, and\r\n\"insular\" climates in small tracts surrounded by sea. Continental\r\nclimates show great differences in seasonal temperatures, the winters\r\ntending to be unusually cold and the summers unusually warm, while the\r\nclimate of insular tracts is characterised by equableness and also by\r\ngreater dampness. Great Britain possesses, by reason of its position,\r\na temperate insular climate, but its average annual temperature is\r\nmuch higher than could be expected from its latitude. The prevalent\r\nsouth-westerly winds cause a drift of the surface-waters of the\r\nAtlantic towards our shores, and this warm-water current, which we know\r\nas the Gulf Stream, is the chief cause of the mildness of our winters.\r\n\r\nMost of our weather comes to us from the Atlantic. It would be\r\nimpossible here within the limits of a short chapter to discuss\r\nfully the causes which affect or control weather changes. It must\r\nsuffice to say that the conditions are in the main either cyclonic\r\nor anticyclonic, which terms may be best explained, perhaps,\r\nby comparing the air currents to a stream of water. In a stream a\r\nchain of eddies may often be seen fringing the more steadily-moving\r\ncentral water. Regarding the general north-easterly moving air from\r\nthe Atlantic as such a stream, a chain of eddies may be developed in\r\na belt parallel with its general direction. This belt of eddies or\r\ncyclones, as they are termed, tends to shift its position, sometimes\r\npassing over our islands, sometimes to the north or south of them,\r\nand it is to this shifting that most of our weather changes are\r\ndue. Cyclonic conditions are associated with a greater or less amount\r\nof atmospheric disturbance; anticyclonic with calms.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent Atlantic winds largely affect our island in another\r\nway, namely in its rainfall. The air, heavily laden with moisture\r\nfrom its passage over the ocean, meets with elevated land-tracts\r\ndirectly it reaches our shores--the moorland of Devon and Cornwall,\r\nthe Welsh mountains, or the fells of Cumberland and Westmorland--and\r\nblowing up the rising land-surface, parts with this moisture as\r\nrain. To how great an extent this occurs is best seen by reference\r\nto the map of the annual rainfall of England on the next page, where\r\nit will at once be noticed that the heaviest fall is in the west,\r\nand that it decreases with remarkable regularity until the least fall\r\nis reached on our eastern shores. Thus in 1906, the maximum rainfall\r\nfor the year occurred at Glaslyn in the Snowdon district, where 205\r\ninches of rain fell; and the lowest was at Boyton in Suffolk, with a\r\nrecord of just under 20 inches. These western highlands, therefore,\r\nmay not inaptly be compared to an umbrella, sheltering the country\r\nfurther eastward from the rain.\r\n\r\nThe above causes, then, are those mainly concerned in influencing the\r\nweather, but there are other and more local factors which often affect\r\ngreatly the climate of a place, such, for example, as configuration,\r\nposition, and soil. The shelter of a range of hills, a southern aspect,\r\na sandy soil, will thus produce conditions which may differ greatly\r\nfrom those of a place--perhaps at no great distance--situated on a\r\nwind-swept northern slope with a cold clay soil.\r\n\r\nBerkshire is an inland county but no part of it is as much as 75\r\nmiles from the coast. The chalk downs have a fine bracing climate, and\r\nthough some of the valleys may be relaxing and some of the moorland\r\ntracts bleak, the general climate of the county is exceedingly\r\nhealthy. Compared with the south coast of England Berkshire is rather\r\ncooler, with somewhat less sunshine and less rain than the coast.\r\n\r\nTemperature, it should be remarked, varies according to height above\r\nsea level, falling about 1° Fahr. for each 100 to 300 feet upwards. In\r\na comparatively level district, like Berkshire, this is not a very\r\nserious consideration. The mean temperature for the year varies\r\nin different parts of England from about 47·3 in the north-eastern\r\ncounties to about 49·6 in the south-east. The mean temperature is\r\nabout 49·0 in northern Berkshire and about 47·5 in south-western\r\nBerkshire. It may be of interest to give the mean temperature for one\r\nyear at places in and close around Berkshire. We take the year 1907 and\r\nthe figures are as follows--Maidenhead 49·4, Wokingham 47·7, Swarraton\r\nin Hampshire 47·9, Marlborough in Wiltshire 47·4, and Oxford 48·9.\r\n\r\nThe average temperature in the month of January varies from 37·0 to\r\n38·0 in different parts of the county, and the average temperature\r\nfor July from 59·7 to 62·0.\r\n\r\nIn England bright sunshine is most prevalent on the coast and\r\ndecreases inland. The annual total amount for the south and east\r\ncoast from Cornwall to Norfolk is nearly 1800 hours, whilst in the\r\nnorthern midland counties the amount is about 1200 hours. There\r\nare no definite data available for giving the amount for Berkshire,\r\nbut there are probably about 1500 hours of bright sunshine in the year.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall varies a good deal in different parts of the county. The\r\namount is lowest in the north-east and highest in the south-west. Thus\r\nWallingford and Cookham have a rainfall of about 23 inches a year on an\r\naverage. At Reading, which is somewhat to the south-west, the amount\r\nis nearly 24 inches a year, and on a line running through Wellington\r\nCollege and Yattendon the amount is nearly 25 inches. Letcombe\r\nRegis and Ashbury have a rainfall of between 25 and 26 inches. At\r\nFaringdon the figure is above 26, and in the south-western corner of\r\nthe county there is a rainfall of about 29 inches a year. The average\r\nyearly rainfall for the whole of England is 31·62 inches, and for the\r\nBritish Isles it is 39·25 inches. Looking at the extremes of rainfall\r\nin England we find the lowest at Shoeburyness with an average of 19·7\r\ninches for the year, whilst Seathwaite in Cumberland has an average\r\nrainfall of 133·53 inches per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. PEOPLE--RACE. POPULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know little about the ancient people who made and used the flint\r\nimplements which are found in the river gravels around Reading and\r\nat other places, and even when we come to the latter part of the\r\nStone Age, though we find skeletons in the barrows or mounds upon\r\nour downs, our information about the race is exceedingly small, and\r\nthis is perhaps not to be wondered at, for in no case do we find any\r\nknowledge of the art of writing in the stage of culture when only\r\nstone and no metal implements were used. Moreover, we must bear in\r\nmind that all we know about early England from written history is\r\nfrom the works of foreign merchants or of foreign conquerors.\r\n\r\nThe Belgae who occupied the part of Britain south of the Thames\r\nat the time of Caesar's invasion may have been partly or mostly\r\nGauls. The tribe named the Atrebates occupied most or all of what is\r\nnow Berkshire, and Silchester in Hampshire was their chief town.\r\n\r\nDuring the Roman occupation the district was far from the frontier,\r\nand the inhabitants continued their peaceful village life, becoming\r\nmore or less Romanised.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the Romans the Saxons spread gradually over the\r\ncountry and were probably settled in Berkshire before A.D. 568. The\r\ninvaders made a clean sweep of Roman civilisation, destroyed the\r\nvillages and houses, and extirpated the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 597 Augustine with his band of monks landed in the Isle of\r\nThanet, and the conversion of the Saxons proceeded rapidly, and in\r\ntime letters, arts, and civilisation returned to the county.\r\n\r\nIn later times Berkshire was overwhelmed by the Danes, and conquered\r\nby the Normans, but neither Danes nor Normans made anything like so\r\ngreat a change in the face of the country as had been effected by the\r\nSaxons, and there is even now a large Saxon element in our people,\r\nin our language, and in our manners and customs.\r\n\r\nIn early days there was a considerable population living on the chalk\r\ndowns, but by degrees they moved elsewhere, and for a long time the\r\npeople were mainly gathered in the valleys, especially along the banks\r\nof the rivers Thames and Kennet. Nearly all the Berkshire towns are\r\nsituated upon one or other of those rivers. In quite modern times\r\nthere has been a great increase of population in the eastern end of\r\nthe county, large areas of heath-land having been built over.\r\n\r\nThe population of Berkshire was steadily increasing during the\r\nwhole of the last century. In 1801 the census gave a population of\r\n110,752, and this had increased in 1851 to 170,243, and in 1901 to\r\n256,509. That is to say the population of the county had more than\r\ndoubled in the century.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 there were 72,217 people living in the county borough of\r\nReading. Of the six municipal boroughs in Berkshire Windsor had the\r\nlargest population, and the others in order of numbers of inhabitants\r\nwere Maidenhead, Newbury, Abingdon, Wokingham, and Wallingford.\r\n\r\nOf the persons registered as inhabitants of Berkshire in 1901, 398\r\nwere in hospital, 150 of whom were in the Royal Berkshire Hospital\r\nat Reading; 1638 were in Lunatic Asylums, of whom 646 were in the\r\nCounty Lunatic Asylum, Cholsey; 657 in the Criminal Lunatic Asylum\r\nat Broadmoor, and 335 in the Holloway Sanatorium, Egham, which is in\r\nthe county of Surrey, but is included in Berkshire for registration\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nOne man and one woman were described as over 100 years of age and\r\nthey were both living in Reading. Five men and thirteen women were\r\ndescribed as between 95 and 100 years of age.\r\n\r\nIn the military barracks in the county there were 392 officers and\r\n1860 non-commissioned officers and men--the 344 cadets at the Royal\r\nMilitary College, Sandhurst, being included amongst the officers.\r\n\r\nThe number of men engaged in the general or local government of the\r\ncounty was 1423. The number engaged in teaching as schoolmasters,\r\nprofessors, etc., was 590 men and 1712 women.\r\n\r\nIn many counties a large number of persons are described as living\r\nin ships, barges or boats, but in Berkshire the number in 1901 was\r\nonly nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the soil has probably been carried on, to some\r\nextent, since the days of the people who made the stone implements,\r\nthough they doubtless chiefly concerned themselves with the chase. The\r\nearly inhabitants lived partly on the chalk land and partly on\r\nthe banks of the rivers. The art of cultivation no doubt spread by\r\ndegrees amongst the natives, and not only the flat chalk surfaces\r\nbut even the steep sides of the downs were brought into service, and\r\nthey may be seen now scored with horizontal terraces in many places,\r\npartly the result of cultivation in long strips on the hill side,\r\nand partly made intentionally to assist cultivation. Terraces of this\r\nkind are found in many parts of England and are known as \"linchets\" or\r\n\"lynchets.\" They form a marked feature in the landscape, near Compton\r\nBeauchamp for instance, and were at one time thought to be old sea\r\nbeaches, but this was an error; the sea had nothing to do with their\r\nformation. They are cultivation terraces in most cases, though in\r\nsome instances they may be, at least in part, due to landslip or to\r\na natural accumulation of rain wash.\r\n\r\nDuring Saxon times the greater part of Berkshire came under\r\ncultivation, and agriculture has ever since been the main industry\r\nof our county. The Vale of White Horse and its neighbourhood is one\r\nof the most fertile tracts in England, and there is also some rich\r\npasture land on the alluvium by the rivers at Abingdon, Purley,\r\nNewbury, Woolhampton, Theale, Reading, and Twyford.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth and the early part of the nineteenth centuries\r\ncorn-growing was very profitable, and a great deal of land was laid\r\ndown in corn, some of it being far from suited to the purpose. In\r\nlater times the profit on corn has been reduced and some of this land\r\nhas been turned to other uses or has gone out of cultivation. In 1905\r\nthe area in Berkshire devoted to corn was 98,968 acres, and in 1908\r\nthe area was 96,169 acres, a reduction of 2799 acres. The reduction\r\nwas mainly in the crop of wheat, there was only a slight reduction\r\nin barley, whilst there was an increase in the amount of oats. The\r\nrelative amount of wheat, barley, and oats grown in 1908 is shown in\r\nthe diagram at the end of this volume.\r\n\r\nBerkshire is not one of the great fruit-growing counties. In 1908\r\nthe acreage returned as orchards was 2942.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of arable land in the county in 1908 was 179,047\r\nacres. This includes the land under clover, sainfoin, and grasses under\r\nrotation 35,760 acres. The area of permanent grass was 175,017 acres,\r\nmaking a total of 354,064 acres under either crops or grass.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the production of milk is one of the most important\r\nindustries of the county, the chief dairy district being the northern\r\npart and the tracts along the rivers. In 1908 the number of cattle\r\nin the county was 48,118. A cheese like single Gloucester is made in\r\nthe Vale of White Horse.\r\n\r\nThe number of sheep in Berkshire was returned as 167,413. They do\r\nnot belong to the breed formerly known as \"Berkshire.\" This was a\r\nlarge animal with black face and black or mottled legs, which is now\r\nreplaced by other kinds. The county has long been famous for its pigs,\r\nwhich numbered 26,171 in the year 1908.\r\n\r\nIn former days the vine was cultivated in Berkshire, and a little\r\nvineyard existed as late as the reign of George III outside Windsor\r\nCastle and to the east of Henry VIII's gateway. We also find mention\r\nof vineyards at Abingdon, Bisham, Burghfield, and Wallingford.\r\n\r\nThe number of men engaged in agriculture in Berkshire was 14,918 at\r\nthe time of the last census.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. INDUSTRIES AND MANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have said, Berkshire is essentially an agricultural county,\r\nand the cloth-making which in the days of Ashmole was so great a\r\ntrade that almost the whole nation was supplied from our county,\r\nhas become practically obsolete. There are however at the present\r\nday several industries which give employment to a large number of\r\nworkers in the county. Probably the one most definitely connected\r\nwith our county town Reading is the making of biscuits, an industry\r\nof quite modern growth. Printing, too, is carried on at important\r\nworks at Reading belonging in many cases to London firms, and there\r\nare also more or less active printing presses at nearly all our towns\r\nand in country places too. Printing in Berkshire goes back certainly\r\nto 1528, when John Scolar set up a press in the Abbey of Abingdon and\r\nprinted a breviary, a copy of which is preserved at Emmanuel College,\r\nCambridge. One of the oldest of existing newspapers is the Reading\r\nMercury, started in that town in 1723.\r\n\r\nBrewing has been carried on from the days of the monks, and no\r\ndoubt plenty of good ale was brewed in the Abbeys of Abingdon and\r\nReading. There is a record of malting mills in Wallingford Castle\r\nin 1300. At the present time there are large breweries at Reading,\r\nWindsor, and other places. Tanning is another very old industry\r\nwhich is still carried on with activity. The bark of the oak was\r\nformerly used to a large extent in tanning, and there has always been\r\nan abundance of oak trees in the county. Oak bark is still used to\r\nsome extent. Shoe-making used to be an important cottage industry,\r\nbut the introduction of machinery has carried the work to large\r\nfactories elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNewbury was at one time a great place for barge building, and boats of\r\nmany kinds are now built at various places on the Thames and Kennet,\r\nindeed boat building counts amongst the more important of our active\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned cloth-making as one of the great industries\r\nof the county in former times. The chief centres were Reading,\r\nAbingdon, and Newbury. A fulling mill at Newbury is mentioned in\r\n1205. The interesting Cloth Hall at that place, now a museum, was\r\nbuilt by the Guild of Clothworkers of Newbury, which was incorporated\r\nin 1601, and the beautiful old house of Shaw was built by a Newbury\r\nclothier named Thomas Dolman in 1581. The most famous of the Berkshire\r\nclothiers was John Winchcombe or Smalwoode, known as Jack of Newbury\r\n(died 1520). During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the\r\nclothing trade declined. This was partly due to the activity of the\r\nnorthern clothiers and to the introduction of machinery with the\r\nresulting factory system. Still as late as 1816 there were works\r\nin Katesgrove Lane, Reading, where sail-cloth for the navy was\r\nmanufactured in large quantity.\r\n\r\nThe silk industry too, once of some importance, has left the\r\ndistrict. At the end of the sixteenth century silk-stocking making\r\nwas quite an important industry at Wokingham, and many mulberry trees\r\nwere planted in and near the town. Silk manufactures were also active\r\nat Reading, Newbury, Kintbury, Twyford, and other places.\r\n\r\nSeed-growing is an important industry at Reading and employs a large\r\nnumber of people.\r\n\r\nIron and brass foundries of some importance are established at\r\nReading and many other places, and there are large engineering works\r\nat Wantage.\r\n\r\nThere was a good bell-foundry at Wokingham in the last quarter of the\r\nfourteenth century (temp. Richard II), and several bells made there\r\nstill exist. About 1495 the business was transferred to Reading,\r\nand bell-founding was carried on at that place until the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nLastly, the open country near Lambourn has long been used for training\r\nrace-horses, and there are very large stables in this part of the\r\ncountry. The \"gallops\" now extend from Compton, Ilsley, and Wantage\r\nto Lambourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. MINERALS. BUILDING MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is very little in the way of minerals in the rock or soil of the\r\ncounty. Bands of ironstone are found in the Lower Greensand formation,\r\nand it appears to have been worked near Faringdon. A group of small\r\nhollows to the east of Little Coxwell are known as Cole's Pits and\r\nwere probably dug to get the iron ore.\r\n\r\nTwo chalybeate springs at Sunninghill were at one time quite well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nWhiting or whitening has for a long time been manufactured at\r\nKintbury from soft chalk which is dug there. A layer in the Reading\r\nBeds at Reading used to be dug as fuller's earth for the clothiers\r\nof that town.\r\n\r\nBefore the Norman conquest most of the buildings in the county were\r\nof wood, and of course wood has been very largely used in buildings\r\nat all times. Splendid examples of hewn timber-work may be seen in\r\nmany of our churches and other buildings. There is for example some\r\nvery fine old timber in the Canon's Cloisters at Windsor Castle.\r\n\r\nBrick was a building material in the time of the Romans and its use\r\nwas most probably never wholly discontinued. In Tudor times many of\r\nthe buildings were of brick and timber, and picturesque brick and\r\ntimber structures of various dates will be found in all parts of our\r\ncounty. The gallery at Christ's Hospital, Abingdon, shown on the next\r\npage, is a good example.\r\n\r\nAll the clay formations in Berkshire have been used for brick and tile\r\nmaking. The works at Katesgrove and other places on the banks of the\r\nKennet at Reading are very old and certainly go back to the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In 1901 there were 1029 men and 35 women engaged in brick,\r\ncement, pottery, and like works in Berkshire.\r\n\r\nThe limestone rocks of the Corallian formation have been much quarried\r\nin the district between Faringdon and the river Thames near Oxford,\r\nand the stone has been used in buildings of all ages.\r\n\r\nChalk has also been extensively quarried for building purposes. There\r\nis a great deal of chalk in the walls of the Dean's Cloisters and\r\nalso in other parts of Windsor Castle. Chalk frame-work may be seen\r\nin many church windows, at Old Windsor and Bray for instance. At\r\nWaltham St Lawrence there is a very curious example, for some flints\r\nare actually left in the chalk mullions of the east window of the\r\nnorth chantry. It may be of interest to mention that in the valley\r\nof the Seine in northern France chalk has been extensively used as\r\na building stone--in some of the best buildings at Rouen for example.\r\n\r\nFlints from the chalk are much used as building-material in Berkshire;\r\nthey are employed fixed in concrete to form the core of walls,\r\nas at Reading Abbey, and as facing to walls with stone corners and\r\nwindow-frames. Shottesbrooke Church is faced with beautifully dressed\r\nlittle flints. In other churches the flints are not squared but in\r\nthe rough state. At St Mary's Church, Reading, there is building of\r\na chess-board pattern, one set of squares being stone and the others\r\nformed of small dressed flints. Another example of this chequer-work\r\nis shown in the view of the church at White Waltham here given.\r\n\r\nThe hard sandstone which has been derived from the Eocene strata and\r\nis termed \"sarsen\" (see p. 40) is an important Berkshire building\r\nstone. There is a great deal of it in the walls all over Windsor\r\nCastle, several of the towers and walls being faced with sarsen.\r\n\r\nIn some of the Berkshire gravel beds there is a hard irony\r\nconglomerate, and this has been used as a building material. There\r\nis a good deal in the tower of St Giles Church, Reading, and in the\r\nparish church at Wokingham.\r\n\r\nThere are many building-materials used in the county which have been\r\nbrought from other districts, but this chapter only deals with things\r\nfound in Berkshire itself.\r\n\r\nChalk was formerly used to a large extent for chalking the soil, but\r\nthe practice has now almost fallen into disuse, and in consequence\r\none sees abandoned chalk pits all over the chalk district. The reasons\r\nfor giving up chalking are the increase in the cost of labour and the\r\ndecrease in the value of corn crops, together with the much larger use\r\nof artificial manures. The fertility of many farms now is nevertheless\r\ndue to the liming and chalking of old days, and it is to be regretted\r\nthat the practice has been abandoned to so great an extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. THE HISTORY OF BERKSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that Berkshire probably came into\r\nexistence as a county in the time of King Egbert, who brought the\r\nlong struggle between the kingdoms of the Heptarchy to a close\r\nand established the ascendancy of Wessex over much of the south of\r\nEngland. It is probable that there was still a population living on\r\nthe chalk downs and in occupation of the old forts, and the fertile\r\nVale of White Horse was gradually coming under cultivation. In any\r\ncase there was a royal residence at Wantage, where Alfred the Great\r\nwas born in 849, and a religious foundation at Abingdon. There were\r\nalso at least two towns, Reading and Wallingford.\r\n\r\nAlready in the previous century the English coast had been harried by\r\nthe Viking pirates, but there is no record of their having penetrated\r\nto our district. In 851 they did indeed make their way up the Thames\r\ninto Surrey, but were defeated by Ethelwulf, the son of Egbert, and\r\nhis son Ethelbald at Ockley. They next approached Berkshire from the\r\nsouth coast, and in 860 attacked and plundered Winchester, but were\r\ndefeated by the united forces of Berkshire and Hampshire. Ivor the\r\nDane is said to have reached Reading in 868, and Reading was captured\r\nand occupied by the Danes in 871.\r\n\r\nEthelred was at this time king and together with his brother Alfred\r\nfought the Danes near Reading, but was not successful and retreated\r\nwestwards. The Danes followed and the great battle of Assandun, in\r\nwhich the Danes were put to flight, was fought on the chalk downs at\r\nsome place to the west of Aldworth in 871. There is much doubt as to\r\nthe exact site of the battle. At one time it was supposed that the\r\nWhite Horse was cut on the hill-side as a memorial of the victory,\r\nbut it is now known that this was not so, for the horse is much\r\nolder than the date of the battle. The Danes retreated to Reading,\r\nand only 14 days afterwards they got the better of the Saxons in a\r\nfight at Basing in Hampshire, and were again victorious two months\r\nlater at Merton. A truce, however, followed and the Danes retired\r\nto London. All this was in the year 871, and during the same year\r\nKing Ethelred died and Alfred the Great became king. How King Alfred,\r\nwho ruled until 901, eventually defeated the Danes and came to terms\r\nwith them is well known, and Berkshire for a time enjoyed peace.\r\n\r\nAbout this time there was a royal residence at Faringdon, for it is\r\nrecorded that Edward the Elder died there in 925. His son Athelstan\r\nhad a mint at Wallingford, and three coins struck by him at that\r\nplace are in the collection at the British Museum. The monastery at\r\nAbingdon had been destroyed by the Danes, and St Ethelwold was told\r\nby King Edred to re-establish it, but the work was not accomplished\r\nuntil the reign of Edgar. Ethelred the Unready had a mint at Reading.\r\n\r\nIn 1006 the Danes again appeared in Berkshire and burnt Reading. They\r\nthen advanced up the Thames to Wallingford and burnt that town. They\r\ndid not, however, remain in the county, but carried their booty\r\nto the sea by way of Winchester. Both Reading and Wallingford were\r\nsoon rebuilt. Edward the Confessor struck coins at both these towns,\r\nand there are specimens in the British Museum. The Confessor had a\r\nresidence at Old Windsor, and the great Earl Godwin is said to have\r\ndied there in a manner attributed to the judgment of God. The King\r\ngave Windsor to the Abbey of Westminster, but William the Conqueror\r\nexchanged it for some land in Essex, and built a castle on the chalk\r\nhill near the Thames where the present Windsor Castle stands. Ever\r\nsince the time of the Conqueror Windsor has been a favourite residence\r\nof our Sovereigns.\r\n\r\nIn 1121 Reading Abbey was founded by King Henry I and the first Abbot\r\nwas appointed in 1123. Henry added to the buildings at Windsor, and\r\nhis marriage to his second wife Adelais, daughter of Godfrey Count of\r\nLouvain, took place there in 1121. There was at this time a castle\r\nat Wallingford, for it is recorded that Waleran, Earl of Mellent,\r\nwas imprisoned there in 1126.\r\n\r\nHenry I died in 1135 and was buried in Reading Abbey. On his death\r\nthe peace of the county was disturbed by civil war, for the crown\r\nwas claimed by Henry's nephew, Stephen of Blois, though he had sworn\r\nto support the cause of Henry's daughter Maud or Matilda. Matilda\r\nhad been married twice, and as her first husband was Henry V,\r\nthe Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, she is known as the Empress\r\nMatilda. War between Stephen and Matilda began in 1139 and spread\r\nover most of England. Windsor and Reading were held for Stephen,\r\nwhilst Brian of Wallingford, a great magnate in Berkshire, took the\r\nside of Matilda. Wallingford Castle was besieged by Stephen in 1139\r\nand again in 1145, but without success. A castle at Faringdon built\r\nby Robert Earl of Gloucester was taken and destroyed by Stephen. In\r\n1145 Matilda gave up the contest and retired to France, but in 1152\r\nher son Henry renewed the war and Stephen again besieged Wallingford\r\nand again unsuccessfully. He also besieged Newbury Castle, which\r\nwas held by John Marshal of Hampstead Marshall. Eventually in 1153\r\npeace was made at Wallingford--Stephen to be king for life and to be\r\nsucceeded by Henry, son of Matilda. Stephen died in the next year,\r\n1154, and Henry was crowned as King Henry II. He possessed himself\r\nof Wallingford Castle and held a Council there in 1155. Henry added\r\nto the buildings at Windsor Castle, and the lower part of the south\r\nside of the Upper Ward dates from his time.\r\n\r\nIn 1163 a duel or wager of battle was fought between Robert de\r\nMontfort and Henry of Essex on an island in the Thames below Caversham\r\nBridge. Essex was accused of treachery or cowardice, having thrown\r\naway the standard in a battle at Coleshill. He was defeated in the\r\nduel and was allowed to join the community of Reading Abbey.\r\n\r\nOn April 19th, 1164, the ceremony of hallowing the Abbey Church at\r\nReading was performed by Thomas à Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nin the presence of the King. In 1175 Henry held a royal festival at\r\nReading, and in 1185 we hear of a state ceremony at this town, when\r\nHenry received Heraclius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem. Henry died in\r\n1189 and was succeeded by his son Richard I. Soon after his accession\r\nRichard left England on a crusade, having appointed the Bishops\r\nof Ely and Durham guardians of the kingdom during his absence. To\r\nhis brother John he gave the government of some English districts\r\nand places, including the Honour of Wallingford. After Richard's\r\ndeparture a quarrel arose between the Bishop of Ely, whose name was\r\nLongchamp, and Geoffrey Archbishop of York, and Longchamp caused\r\nGeoffrey to be arrested. Prince John took the part of Geoffrey and\r\ncalled a Council at Reading to demand justification from Longchamp,\r\nwho was summoned to meet the prince at Loddon Bridge, presumably\r\nthe bridge on the Reading and Wokingham road. Longchamp did not\r\nappear, and all the participators in the arrest of the Archbishop\r\nwere excommunicated in Reading church. Longchamp eventually retired\r\nto the continent, and John obtained possession of Windsor Castle,\r\nbut gave it up to Queen Eleanor until Richard should come back--which\r\nhe did in 1194. On Richard's death, in 1199, his brother John became\r\nKing. In 1204 he obtained possession of Beckett near Shrivenham,\r\nonce the property of the Earls of Evreux, and he probably lived there\r\nat times, for a mandate to the Sheriff of Oxfordshire is dated from\r\nBeckett. In 1213 John held an important ecclesiastical Council at\r\nReading Abbey. He died in 1216 and was succeeded by his son Henry,\r\nwho was in his tenth year. William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, son of\r\nJohn Marshal already mentioned, was appointed Regent of the kingdom,\r\nand he held the office until his death in 1219.\r\n\r\nIn the Dean's Cloisters at Windsor may be still seen the crowned\r\nhead of Henry painted during his life by William the monk of\r\nWestminster. Henry added largely to Windsor Castle, and the outer walls\r\nand towers of the Lower Ward are to a great extent his work. Disputes\r\narose between Henry and his barons, and Berkshire was again the scene\r\nof civil war. In 1261 Parliament was summoned to meet at Windsor,\r\nand the castle was fortified by Prince Edward. It was taken in 1263\r\nby Simon de Montfort, and the prince was captured. In time, however,\r\nhe escaped and got the better of the barons.\r\n\r\nIn 1295 Berkshire sent two knights of the shire to Parliament, and\r\nReading and Wallingford also sent representatives. In 1307 the Templars\r\nwere expelled from their Preceptories at Bisham and Templeton. In\r\nthe time of Edward II we hear complaints of robbers in Windsor Forest.\r\n\r\nEdward III was born at Windsor in 1312, and his tenure of power began\r\nat a Court held at Wallingford in 1326, though his father was not\r\ndeposed until the next year. King Edward wished to hold a Round Table\r\nin imitation of King Arthur, and he invited a number of knights both\r\nEnglish and foreign to assemble at Windsor Castle in 1344. No doubt\r\na splendid tournament took place and others followed in subsequent\r\nyears. In 1347 or 1348 a garter with the motto Hony soit qui mal y\r\npense was worn as a device at jousts at Windsor, and the institution\r\nof the Order of the Garter in all probability took place at Windsor\r\nin 1348, though some authorities give the date as 1349. At Christmas,\r\n1346, the King was at Reading and a great jousting was held in his\r\nhonour, and in 1359 John of Gaunt, afterwards Duke of Lancaster, was\r\nmarried at Reading, and there was a great pageant and a tournament\r\nin which the King and his sons took part.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Edward III, William of Wykeham built, or re-built,\r\nthe Round Tower and much of the castle at Windsor. The sword of the\r\nKing is still preserved there.\r\n\r\nIn 1327 Abingdon had a little fight of its own. Some of the\r\ntownspeople, assisted by the Mayor of Oxford and it is said by some\r\nscholars, attacked the Abbey and drove out the monks, part of the\r\nbuildings being burnt and the muniments destroyed. In the end twelve\r\nof the attacking party were hanged and the monks restored.\r\n\r\nIn 1361 the Black Prince married Joan the Fair Maid of Kent. The\r\nmarriage took place at Windsor, and after her husband's death Joan\r\nlived a good deal at Wallingford.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Richard II, which lasted from 1377 to 1399, was marked\r\nby constant troubles between the King with his favourites on the\r\none hand and the nobles on the other. In 1387 Radcot Bridge was the\r\nscene of a fight between the King's party of 5000 men under De Vere,\r\nDuke of Ireland, and Henry Earl of Derby (afterwards Henry IV). De\r\nVere was defeated, and only escaped by swimming down the Thames.\r\n\r\nIn 1399 Richard's inglorious reign came to an end. He was deposed in\r\nfavour of Henry of Bolingbroke, son of John of Gaunt, who became King\r\nas Henry IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. THE HISTORY OF BERKSHIRE (CONTINUED).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reign of Henry IV lasted from 1399 to 1413. The hereditary heir to\r\nthe Crown on the death of Richard II was a child, Edmund Mortimer, Earl\r\nof March, and he was detained a prisoner at Windsor Castle during the\r\nwhole of Henry's reign, and only liberated by Henry V in 1413. There\r\nwas at least one fight in Berkshire during the time of Henry IV. In\r\n1400 an attempt was made by some of the nobles to fall on the King\r\nat Windsor, but he was warned in time, and retired to London, and\r\nwhen the insurgents reached Windsor, they entered the Castle without\r\nopposition, searched for the King, but found he had gone. Meanwhile\r\nhe had raised a force in London, and came to attack the insurgent\r\nnobles, who retreated, and a sharp encounter took place at Maidenhead\r\nBridge. The insurgents retired to Oxford and were eventually defeated.\r\n\r\nJames I, King of Scotland, was a prisoner at Windsor during most of\r\nthe last ten years of his long captivity, which ended by his release\r\nin 1424. His book, The King's Quhair, was written at Windsor, and it\r\nwas at Windsor that he fell in love with Jane Beaufort, who afterwards\r\nbecame his Queen.\r\n\r\nHenry VI was born at Windsor in 1421, and became King when about nine\r\nmonths old. He grew up weak in mind, and during his reign all England\r\nwas involved in the Wars of the Roses. Berkshire was during most of\r\nthe time held by the Lancastrian party, but in 1460 Newbury was taken\r\nby the Earl of Wiltshire on behalf of the Yorkists. In the next year,\r\n1461, the Duke of York obtained the Crown under the name of Edward IV.\r\n\r\nHenry VI held several Parliaments at Reading, and Edward IV also\r\nvisited the Abbey, and it is recorded that in 1464 he made the first\r\npublic announcement of his marriage with Elizabeth Woodville at a\r\ngreat Council of the Peers at Reading. The marriage was not popular,\r\nand it was especially disliked by the Nevilles, the most powerful of\r\nwhom, Richard Earl of Warwick, subsequently defeated Edward's forces\r\nand restored Henry VI, but Henry's renewed reign lasted only some six\r\nmonths, for Edward defeated Warwick, who was killed, at the battle\r\nof Barnet in 1471. Warwick and his brother the Marquis of Montagu,\r\nalso killed at Barnet, were both buried at Bisham Abbey in Berkshire.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle dates from\r\nthe reign of King Edward IV, and he was the first of our kings to\r\nbe buried there, 1483. The body of his rival Henry VI was removed to\r\nWindsor from Chertsey Abbey in 1484. The beautiful Rutland Chapel in\r\nSt George's Chapel was built by Sir Thomas St Leger in memory of his\r\nwife Ann, sister of Edward IV. St Leger was beheaded by Richard III,\r\nbut was buried in the chapel and a brass to himself and his wife\r\nstill remains on the wall there.\r\n\r\nAfter the Wars of the Roses peace reigned in Berkshire for many a\r\nlong year, and the county no doubt increased in wealth and prospered\r\ngenerally. A considerable part of the land was in the possession\r\nof the Church, but in the days of King Henry VIII the whole of the\r\nmonastic institutions were swept away.\r\n\r\nOwing to the dissolution of the monasteries a large part of the land in\r\nBerkshire passed into the hands of the Crown. Some of it was granted\r\nto Oxford colleges and much to private persons.\r\n\r\nIn 1544 three persons, Testwood, Filmer, and Peerson were burnt at\r\nWindsor as heretics, and in 1556 Julius Palmer, Master of Reading\r\nGrammar School, John Gwin, and Thomas Askew were burnt at the sandpits\r\nnear Newbury.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, before her accession in 1558, lived for some three years\r\nat Sir Thomas Hoby's house at Bisham; indeed she was practically a\r\nprisoner under the charge of Sir Thomas and his wife's sisters. When\r\nshe came to the throne Elizabeth like her predecessors lived a good\r\ndeal at Windsor, and we hear of visits by her to Reading, Englefield\r\nHouse (Sir F. Walsingham) and other places. It was in her days that the\r\ntragedy took place which made \"Cumnor Hall\" known all over the world,\r\nthough its celebrity is due more to Scott's novel Kenilworth than to\r\nhistory. The real facts were, however, sufficiently tragic. Amy, the\r\ndaughter of Sir John Robsart, married Lord Robert Dudley, afterwards\r\nEarl of Leicester, in 1550. Ten years later she was found dead, at\r\nCumnor Place, which had been recently purchased by Anthony Forster the\r\nsteward of Lord Robert. Foul play was suspected and it was suggested\r\nthat Dudley had reasons for wishing to get rid of his wife as she\r\nstood in the way of higher ambitions. There were no \"haunted towers\r\nof Cumnor Hall\" for Cumnor Place was not a large house. Now only a\r\nfew remains of walls are left on the site.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Civil War Berkshire was generally Royalist,\r\nand the county was the scene of much fighting during the whole war,\r\nan account of which can be found in any History of England. The Earl\r\nof Essex captured Reading after a siege in 1643, and on September\r\n20th of the same year there was a hard-fought battle between Charles\r\nand Essex near Newbury. Lord Falkland, who was on the King's side,\r\nwas killed at this battle, and a granite monument to his memory stands\r\non the high ground south of the town.\r\n\r\nA second battle took place near Newbury on October 27th, 1644, when\r\nthe Royalists occupied a position near Shaw House between the rivers\r\nKennet and Lambourn. Earthworks, remains of this fight, may still\r\nbe seen at Shaw House. Donnington Castle, near by, held out for the\r\nKing until 1646, and Wallingford Castle fell into the hands of the\r\nParliament in the same year.\r\n\r\nOn February 8th, 1649, Charles was buried in St George's Chapel at\r\nWindsor Castle.\r\n\r\nSince the Civil War there has been only one small fight in Berkshire\r\nand that was in 1688. On December 6th of that year William of Orange\r\nreached Hungerford, and a force of 250 of his men came into conflict\r\nwith 600 of James's Irish troops at Reading. Superior discipline\r\nenabled William's men to drive the Irish in confusion through the\r\nstreets into the market-place where they attempted to rally, but\r\nbeing vigorously attacked in front, and fired upon at the same time\r\nby the inhabitants from the windows, they fled with the loss of their\r\ncolours and 50 men, the conquerors only sustaining a loss of five.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to say of the history of the county since that\r\ndate, though, owing to the frequent residence of the Sovereign at\r\nWindsor, many an event of the highest importance and interest has\r\ntaken place there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. ANTIQUITIES--(A) PREHISTORIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have no written records of Man as he first lived in our land long\r\nages ago. Writing was an unknown art, and records--even if they had\r\nexisted--could not have survived to come down to us. We therefore\r\nspeak of this period as the Prehistoric--the time when the people of\r\nthe past were unable themselves to record their story. Yet, though\r\nthese sources of information are closed to us, we are able from the\r\nrelics they have left behind them--the implements and weapons that\r\nthey used, the bones of the animals they fed upon, the structures\r\nthey erected--to form a fairly clear idea of these early peoples.\r\n\r\nBut this Prehistoric period, vast in its extent, has for convenience\r\nsake been further subdivided. At first the metals were unknown, or at\r\nleast unused, and this period is spoken of as the Stone Age, for it\r\nwas of flints and other stones that weapons and domestic implements\r\nwere mainly fashioned. Later, man learnt how to get the easily-worked\r\nores of tin and copper from the rocks and by their admixture to form\r\nbronze. From this, beautiful weapons and other articles were made,\r\nand from the time of the discovery we date what is known as the\r\nBronze Age. Doubtless the ores of iron had long been known, but how to\r\nsmelt them was another matter. At length the method was discovered,\r\nand mankind was in possession of hard metal implements having great\r\nadvantages for all purposes over those previously employed. Thus the\r\nIron Age began, and the early inhabitants of Britain had arrived at\r\nthis stage of civilisation when the Romans came to our land.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn to a consideration of these various epochs in their\r\norder. Firstly the Stone Age. This, though a convenient term as\r\ncovering all the period before the advent of the Metal Ages, is\r\ntoo indefinite both as to time and race, and hence it is usual to\r\nspeak of the Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age, and the Neolithic or\r\nNew Stone Age. The people of these two Ages were very distinct, and\r\nmost authorities hold that--at all events in our land--a vast gap of\r\ntime separated them, though no such gap occurred between the later\r\nAges. Palaeolithic man, from various causes, ceased to inhabit what\r\nwe now call Britain, and when the country was re-peopled it was by\r\nNeolithic man. Palaeolithic man lived in the days when the mammoth,\r\nreindeer, and hyaena roamed over our country; made leaf-shaped\r\nroughly-flaked flint weapons which were never ground or polished;\r\ncultivated no plants and tamed no animals; and built no monuments,\r\ngraves, or houses. Neolithic man, on the other hand, learnt how to\r\ngrind and polish his implements; was both a farmer and a breeder of\r\nstock; had many industries; and built megalithic monuments, houses,\r\nand graves--the remains of which survive to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe earliest signs of the existence of man in Berkshire are, as we have\r\nsaid, the implements of stone, mostly flint, found in the gravels;\r\nand the implements of the Palaeolithic Period take us back to a very\r\nold time, so old that the surface features of our district were then\r\nquite different from what we see now.\r\n\r\nThere is a fine series of Palaeolithic implements in the Reading\r\nMuseum, and most of them have been found in gravel-pits near the\r\nriver Thames in the Reading and Twyford district, or in the Cookham\r\nand Maidenhead district. The implements occur in the gravel in such\r\na way as to prove that they were brought into the position in which\r\nwe find them at the same time and in the same manner as the other\r\nstones in the gravel, and the men who made them consequently lived\r\nat or before the date of the making of the beds of gravel. All the\r\ngravels in question were made by our rivers, and as the places where\r\nwe find the implements are in some cases from 85 to 114 feet above\r\nthe present level of the river, we infer that the valley has been\r\ndeepened as much as from 85 to 114 feet since the time when the men\r\nwho made the implements lived.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Neolithic Period when, as we have seen, man was a\r\nmuch more civilised person than the earlier man is believed to have\r\nbeen. Some of his burial mounds still remain, and being oval in plan\r\nare known as long barrows. Wayland Smith's Cave, a mile to the east\r\nof Ashbury (p. 83), is composed of some 32 stones, the remains of a\r\nlong barrow of Neolithic times.\r\n\r\nNeolithic implements are of stone, but in many cases they are unlike\r\nthe older implements in being of polished stone. In the Reading\r\nMuseum there is a fine polished flint chisel from Englefield, and also\r\npolished axes from Broadmoor, from Pangbourne, and from the beds of the\r\nThames and Kennet. In the British Museum there is a beautiful dagger\r\nof flint from a barrow on Lambourn Down. Pretty little arrow-heads have\r\nbeen found at many places on the downs and in the Wallingford district.\r\n\r\nThere was in Berkshire a long interval between the Palaeolithic and\r\nthe Neolithic Periods, but so far as we know there was no such break\r\nbetween the Neolithic Period and the Bronze Age. All we can say is\r\nthat there was a time when the inhabitants of our district began to\r\nuse implements of copper, or of copper alloyed with tin, i.e. bronze,\r\nfor some purposes, but they still continued to use implements of stone,\r\nand it is not always possible to say whether a stone implement belongs\r\nto the Neolithic Period, to the Bronze Age, or to an even later date.\r\n\r\nMany remains of the Bronze Age have been found in burial-mounds or\r\nbarrows, and the barrows of this period are circular, with a diameter\r\nof fifty to one hundred feet, and hence termed round barrows. Many\r\npieces of sepulchral pottery of this age from Berkshire will be found\r\nboth in the British Museum and the Reading Museum. A considerable\r\nnumber of bronze implements were found in one place at Yattendon,\r\nand another hoard of them was discovered at Wallingford. A great many\r\nbronze swords, daggers, and spear-heads have been found in the river\r\nThames, and are to be seen in the Museums.\r\n\r\nA cemetery of this period was found at Sulham, and many earthenware\r\nurns from it are in the Reading Museum. There are also in the Museum\r\nsome urns from Neolithic barrows at Sunningdale.\r\n\r\nThe extensive deposits of peat at and around Newbury show that it was\r\na marsh and lake district until historical time, and remains of pile\r\ndwellings have been found in the market-place, in Bartholomew Street,\r\nand in Cheap Street. Their date cannot be fixed with certainty,\r\nbut they are almost certainly prehistoric in age.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of iron for bronze indicates a considerable advance\r\nin knowledge, for, except in meteorites, pure iron is not found in\r\nnature, and no small skill is required to separate the metal from\r\nthe earth or rock in which it occurs. There is, however, no definite\r\ndivision between the Bronze and the Iron Age, for implements and\r\nornaments of both bronze and stone continued to be used. Nor is there\r\nany definite end to the Iron Age: it passes onwards into the period\r\nof written history.\r\n\r\nA number of bones and various objects found in a grave on Hagbourne\r\nHill seemed to show that a man, a horse, and possibly also a chariot\r\nhad been buried there.\r\n\r\nAncient British coins have been found at Brightwell, Newbury,\r\nWallingford, and at other places in Berkshire. Many of them bear on one\r\nside a rude representation of a horse, probably an imitation of the\r\nhorse on the gold stater of Philip II of Macedon, who became king in\r\nB.C. 359. These gold coins, known as Philips, were current in Greece\r\nand in the East for a long period, and have been occasionally found\r\nin circulation even in modern times. The White Horse, which is cut\r\nin the turf on the chalk hill above Uffington, bears a considerable\r\nresemblance to the horse on the British coins, and may very probably\r\nbe of the same date.\r\n\r\nThere are a great number of mounds and earthworks scattered over\r\nBerkshire, and it is exceedingly difficult to assign to them their\r\nproper dates. We have already mentioned Wayland Smith's Cave as\r\nthe remains of a long barrow of the Neolithic Period, and we have\r\nalso referred to the round barrows of the Bronze Age. Some of the\r\nfortifications may date from these early times but many are probably\r\nof later date. It was for a long time needful to provide defence for\r\nthe dwellings, not only against men, but also against wild animals,\r\nand the earthworks were no doubt used over and over again by successive\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the chalk district was at one time the most populous\r\npart of the county, and we consequently find the downs dotted over with\r\nmounds and earthworks of very ancient date. Perhaps the best known of\r\nthese is the fine earthwork named Uffington Castle on White Horse Hill\r\n(see p. 7). Alfred's Castle is a circular earthwork close to Ashdown\r\nPark and three miles south-west of Uffington Castle. Letcombe Castle\r\nis another fair-sized work on the Ridge Way, rather more than five\r\nmiles east of White Horse Hill. There is a large earthwork called\r\nDanish Camp on Blewburton Hill to the south of Didcot.\r\n\r\nThere are a few old earthworks in the Vale of White Horse district. One\r\ncrowns Badbury Hill near Faringdon. Cherbury Camp is a large oval work\r\non low ground near Buckland. Sinodun Hill to the north of Wallingford\r\nhas evidently been fortified in early times, and Wallingford itself\r\nhas the remains of an old and extensive earthwork round the town.\r\n\r\nPassing to the Forest District we find many mounds and banks on the\r\nheaths, and there is one very fine earthwork known as Caesar's Camp\r\nnear Easthampstead. It was very likely used by the Romans, but is\r\nalmost certainly of still older date. Finally it is highly probable\r\nthat Windsor Castle stands on the site of an old fort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. ANTIQUITIES--(B) ROMAN AND SAXON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reading Museum contains one of the finest Anglo-Roman collections\r\nin England. It is the result of careful and systematic excavation,\r\ncarried on for a series of years, on the site of the town of\r\nSilchester, and the collection is of the greatest interest to us as\r\nillustrating the life in an English country town in the days of the\r\nRomans. The locality is however in Hampshire, the Berkshire boundary\r\nmaking a detour so as to leave it in the neighbouring county.\r\n\r\nAccording to the ordnance map, Speen House near Newbury was the site\r\nof the Roman Spinae, but no Roman remains have been found there, though\r\nthere is evidence of a settlement of some importance at Newbury itself.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of houses of the Roman period have been found at\r\nseveral places in Berkshire; thus at Frilford near Marcham the\r\nremains of a small Romano-British house were found; and near by, in\r\nFrilford Field, a cemetery of the same period, which had subsequently\r\nbeen used by the Anglo-Saxons. Remains of a house with tessellated\r\npavements were found on the Great Western Railway at Basildon, and\r\nother remains of Romano-British buildings have been discovered near\r\nMaidenhead and Waltham St Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThe words \"Roman Villa\" will be found marked on the ordnance map\r\nat two places to the south of Hampstead Norris, and remains of\r\nbuildings have been discovered near Letcombe Regis, and at other\r\nplaces. The earthworks on Lowbury Hill to the west of Streatley are\r\nusually believed to be a Roman camp, and it is probable that the Roman\r\nsoldiers occupied many of the old British forts at one time or another.\r\n\r\nRoman coins and pottery of the Romano-British period have been found\r\nalmost all over the county, though they may be said to be most common\r\nalong the valley of the Thames and least so near Faringdon. In the\r\nReading Museum there are a good many objects of Roman date which were\r\nfound in Reading itself. Specimens are exhibited from two small hoards\r\nof coins dating from the Emperor Valentinian A.D. 364 to the Emperor\r\nHonorius A.D. 423. The coins are in very good preservation and were\r\nprobably hidden when the Roman soldiers departed from England.\r\n\r\nThere are signs of Roman settlements along the Devil's Highway,\r\nthe road from Silchester to London. Thus there was evidently a\r\nRomano-British village at Wickham Bushes close to Caesar's Camp\r\non Easthampstead Plain. A collection from this locality exists at\r\nWellington College.\r\n\r\nA number of objects of the Anglo-Saxon period found in Berkshire will\r\nbe seen in the Anglo-Saxon room at the British Museum. There is a very\r\nfine sword-blade from Ashdown, and a variety of objects--shield-bosses,\r\nknives, etc.--from Long Wittenham, where a Saxon burial-place has been\r\nexplored. In some cases the body had been burnt, whilst in others the\r\nskeletons remained, and were found to be of a large-sized and robust\r\nrace. Another Anglo-Saxon cemetery was discovered at Arne Hill near\r\nLockinge, and a number of Anglo-Saxon interments in the Lambourn valley\r\nnear East Shefford. Two burial-places of this period have been found\r\nat Reading. One contained spear-heads, knives, and bronze ornaments,\r\nand was probably of pagan date, whilst the other is believed to have\r\nbeen to some extent a Christian burial-place. In it a pewter chalice\r\nwas found which may have been buried with a priest. The objects from\r\nthese two localities are in the Reading Museum. Numbers of Anglo-Saxon\r\ncoins have been dug up in Berkshire, more especially in the Cholsey\r\nand Wallingford district. They are of silver about the diameter of\r\na sixpence but much thinner and are called pennies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. ARCHITECTURE--(A) ECCLESIASTICAL. CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA preliminary word on the various styles of English architecture\r\nis necessary before we consider the churches and other important\r\nbuildings of our county.\r\n\r\nPre-Norman or, as it is usually, though with no great certainty\r\ntermed, Saxon building in England, was the work of early craftsmen\r\nwith an imperfect knowledge of stone construction, who commonly used\r\nrough rubble walls, no buttresses, small semi-circular or triangular\r\narches, and square towers with what is termed \"long-and-short work\"\r\nat the quoins or corners. It survives almost solely in portions of\r\nsmall churches.\r\n\r\nThe Norman conquest started a widespread building of massive\r\nchurches and castles in the continental style called Romanesque,\r\nwhich in England has got the name of \"Norman.\" They had walls of\r\ngreat thickness, semi-circular vaults, round-headed doors and windows,\r\nand lofty square towers.\r\n\r\nFrom 1150 to 1200 the building became lighter, the arches pointed,\r\nand there was perfected the science of vaulting, by which the weight\r\nis brought upon piers and buttresses. This method of building,\r\nthe \"Gothic,\" originated from the endeavour to cover the widest\r\nand loftiest areas with the greatest economy of stone. The first\r\nEnglish Gothic, called \"Early English,\" from about 1180 to 1250, is\r\ncharacterised by slender piers (commonly of marble), lofty pointed\r\nvaults, and long, narrow, lancet-headed windows. After 1250 the\r\nwindows became broader, divided up, and ornamented by patterns of\r\ntracery, while in the vault the ribs were multiplied. The greatest\r\nelegance of English Gothic was reached from 1260 to 1290, at which\r\ndate English sculpture was at its highest, and art in painting,\r\ncoloured glass making, and general craftsmanship at its zenith.\r\n\r\nAfter 1300 the structure of stone buildings began to be overlaid with\r\nornament, the window tracery and vault ribs were of intricate patterns,\r\nthe pinnacles and spires loaded with crocket and ornament. This later\r\nstyle is known as \"Decorated,\" and came to an end with the Black Death,\r\nwhich stopped all building for a time.\r\n\r\nWith the changed conditions of life the type of building\r\nchanged. With curious uniformity and quickness the style called\r\n\"Perpendicular\"--which is unknown abroad--developed after 1360 in all\r\nparts of England and lasted with scarcely any change up to 1520. As\r\nits name implies, it is characterised by the perpendicular arrangement\r\nof the tracery and panels on walls and in windows, and it is also\r\ndistinguished by the flattened arches and the square arrangement of\r\nthe mouldings over them, by the elaborate vault-traceries (especially\r\nfan-vaulting), and by the use of flat roofs and towers without spires.\r\n\r\nThe mediaeval styles in England ended with the dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries (1530-1540), for the Reformation checked the building of\r\nchurches. There succeeded the building of manor-houses, in which the\r\nstyle called \"Tudor\" arose--distinguished by flat-headed windows,\r\nlevel ceilings, and panelled rooms. The ornaments of classic style\r\nwere introduced under the influences of Renaissance sculpture and\r\ndistinguish the \"Jacobean\" style, so called after James I. About this\r\ntime the professional architect arose. Hitherto, building had been\r\nentirely in the hands of the builder and the craftsman.\r\n\r\nMuch of the stone used in Berkshire is of local origin, as has already\r\nbeen mentioned in Chapter 12, but a great deal has also been brought\r\nfrom a distance. Thus it is recorded that when the Abbot of Abingdon\r\nin 1100 rebuilt the conventual buildings as well as much of the\r\nabbey church, the materials were brought from Wales, six waggons,\r\neach drawn by twelve oxen, being engaged in the work. A great deal\r\nof Bath stone will be found in Berkshire buildings and some has even\r\nbeen brought from Caen in Normandy. Pillars and tombstones of Purbeck\r\nmarble are common in the churches. In the south wall of the Dean's\r\nCloisters at Windsor (temp. Henry III) there are clusters of columns\r\nand one column in each is of Purbeck marble.\r\n\r\nThe tower of the church at Wickham, north-west of Newbury, is of\r\na very early style of architecture, showing a variety of \"long and\r\nshort\" work. Two of the belfry windows are double with a pillar in\r\nthe middle, and are characteristic of this early work. The walls are\r\nvery thick. The remainder of the church has been rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOn pages 96 and 97 there are views of Norman doorways at Faringdon,\r\nboth round-headed and one with an embattled moulding over the door. The\r\nchurch at Avington on the banks of the river Kennet a little below\r\nHungerford is a good example of the Norman style of architecture,\r\nand there is a most interesting little church at Finchampstead\r\nnear Wokingham of which a view is given on page 98. It was built\r\nin the twelfth century and the east end of the chancel is round,\r\nas was usual at that time. The original windows were probably very\r\nsmall, and those which we now see were cut in the wall since Norman\r\ntimes. The north aisle, too, is newer than the body of the church,\r\nand the brick tower only dates from the seventeenth century. In the\r\nchurch there is a Norman font. There is more or less Norman work\r\nremaining in many of our other churches. Thus the illustration on\r\npage 92 gives a view of the church of St Nicholas at Abingdon, and a\r\nround-headed Norman doorway will be seen under the tower, whilst the\r\nremainder of the building belongs to a later style of architecture,\r\nprobably of the fifteenth century. The tower of West Shefford church\r\nis curious, the lower part is round and of Norman date, whilst the\r\nupper part is octagonal and was built subsequently.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the Early English style of architecture there is on\r\npage 99 a view of Faringdon Church, which it will be seen is built in\r\nthe form of a cross with a massive square tower in the middle. Some of\r\nthe arches inside the church are round-headed like Norman arches, but\r\nthe windows are of the long narrow shape usual in the Early English\r\nstyle of building. We have churches built mainly in this style in\r\nmany places, such as Ardington, Buckland, and Uffington.\r\n\r\nOf the Decorated style there is a most beautiful church at Shottesbrook\r\nnear White Waltham, which was built by Sir William Tressel in 1337. It\r\nis cruciform with a tall spire. The walls are of small dressed flints,\r\nwith corners and window and door frames of stone. The roof is tiled\r\nand the spire of stone, the east end window large with beautiful stone\r\ntracery (p. 158), and the church is an unusually good example of the\r\nDecorated style. The Greyfriars Church at Reading was also built in\r\nthe Decorated style. It was long a ruin or used for various purposes,\r\nbut is now restored. We also have churches mainly in this style of\r\narchitecture at Sparsholt, Warfield, and at other places.\r\n\r\nWe have many examples of Perpendicular style in Berkshire, but by\r\nfar the best is the Chapel of St George in Windsor Castle (pp. 69,\r\n71). The greater part of this chapel was built in the time of Edward\r\nIV. The windows are large and the nave consequently very light. The\r\nstone roof of the nave was added by Henry VII, and that of the\r\nchoir by Henry VIII. In the choir are the stalls of the Knights of\r\nthe Garter, and installation ceremonies of the Order are performed\r\nhere. St Helen's Church, Abingdon, is our best Berkshire parish church\r\nin the Perpendicular style (the tower is Early English). It is large,\r\nwith five aisles, as will be seen in the illustration here given. The\r\nchurch at Bray is chiefly celebrated on account of a vicar, one Simon\r\nAleyn, who died in 1588 after holding the living under Henry VIII,\r\nEdward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth and altering his views as occasion\r\nrequired. The church is however of itself interesting, and in it will\r\nbe found examples of Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular\r\nwork. The tower belongs to the latest of these styles and is but\r\nbadly joined on to the aisle of Edwardian date. It is mostly built of\r\nflints, but a broad band of chalk will be noticed about half-way up\r\n(p. 149). There is a good example of a church in this style at Newbury.\r\n\r\nBrick church towers are a feature of eastern Berkshire and many of\r\nthem date from the seventeenth century. One of these, at Finchampstead,\r\nis shown in the illustration on page 98.\r\n\r\nThere are crosses or their remains in many of the churchyards and\r\nvillages. At Ardington there is both a new cross and the shaft of\r\nan old one. There are crosses at Denchworth, Goosey, East Hagbourne,\r\nInglesham, North or Ferry Hinksey, Steventon, etc.\r\n\r\nAt Harwell the rood-screen still remains; there are interesting lead\r\nfonts at Childrey and at Long Wittenham; and stands for hour-glasses\r\nstill exist in the churches at Binfield, Hurst, and Inglesham.\r\n\r\nIn former times it was very common to keep books in the churches\r\nfastened to the shelf or reading-desk by chains, and a few of them\r\nstill remain. There are several in St Helen's Church, Abingdon. A\r\nchained Bible of 1611 is in Cumnor church, and until recently\r\nthere were several at Denchworth, but they have been removed to the\r\nvicarage, and Caxton's Golden Legend of 1483 which used to be chained\r\nin Denchworth Church is now in the Bodleian Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. ARCHITECTURE--(B) RELIGIOUS HOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year A.D. 528 Benedict of Nursia drew up his celebrated rules\r\nat Monte Cassino in Italy, and founded the order of the Benedictine or\r\nBlack Monks. The order rapidly spread over Europe and was established\r\nin Berkshire at an early period. The great Abbey of Abingdon dates\r\nfrom the days of the Saxon Kings, and at the time of Domesday survey\r\nit possessed 30 manors in Berkshire besides lands in other counties,\r\nand it continued to grow in wealth and power until its dissolution by\r\nHenry VIII. The great church of the abbey has been destroyed, but there\r\nare some interesting remains of the abbey buildings which, after having\r\nbeen put to varied uses, are now in the hands of the Corporation and\r\ncarefully preserved. The illustration given on page 74 shows the south\r\nside of what appears to have been a dormitory divided by partitions.\r\n\r\nIn 1121 Henry I founded a second great Benedictine abbey in Berkshire\r\nat Reading, probably upon the site of an older monastic dwelling. Cluny\r\nhad been founded in 910 as an order with a reformed Benedictine rule,\r\nand Reading was founded as an abbey of that order. Its connection with\r\nCluny did not, however, last long, and early in the thirteenth century\r\nthe abbey seems to have become attached to the general Benedictine\r\norder. Reading became one of the greatest of English abbeys. Its\r\nabbot, like the Abbot of Abingdon, was entitled to wear the mitre\r\nand was summoned with the other spiritual peers to attend parliament.\r\n\r\nBoth Reading and Abingdon were dissolved by Henry VIII, and on\r\nNovember 14th, 1539, Hugh Faringdon, the 31st abbot of Reading, was\r\nhanged, drawn, and quartered within sight of his own gateway. The\r\nlast abbot of Abingdon had made himself more agreeable to the king,\r\nand was granted the manor of Cumnor for life, and a pension as well.\r\n\r\nThe stone from Reading Abbey was much used for buildings in Reading\r\nand the neighbourhood, and in 1556, during the reign of Philip and\r\nMary, a great deal was removed from the abbey and taken by river to\r\nWindsor for building the Poor Knights' Lodgings. The inner gateway of\r\nthe abbey is still standing but has been partially rebuilt in modern\r\ntimes. There are also some remains of the abbey buildings probably\r\nbelonging to the Hospice of St John.\r\n\r\nIn the time of William the Conqueror (about 1086) Geoffrey de\r\nMandeville gave the church of St Mary at Hurley, together with certain\r\nlands, for a cell of Benedictine monks to be subject to the Abbey of\r\nWestminster, and the remains of the priory thus founded are exceedingly\r\nbeautiful and of much interest. The chapel, built in the Norman style\r\nof architecture, is now the parish church of Hurley. The illustration\r\nabove shows the refectory or dining hall of the priory. The lower\r\npart is in the Norman style and the upper part of Edwardian date. On\r\nthe opposite side of this building is the river Thames.\r\n\r\nThere was a priory of the Benedictines at Wallingford, and a\r\nBenedictine nunnery at Bromhall in the parish of Sunninghill, but\r\nthere are now no remains of either.\r\n\r\nThe only establishment connected with the great order of the\r\nCistercians in the county was a small cell at Faringdon and a grange\r\nor barn at Great Coxwell, both belonging to the Abbey of Beaulieu in\r\nHampshire. The fine abbey barn, dating from the fourteenth century,\r\nstill remains.\r\n\r\nThe Austin Canons, an order founded at Avignon about 1061, had priories\r\nat Bisham, Poughley, and Sandleford. After the dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries Bisham Abbey became the seat of the Hoby family. It is\r\nbeautifully situated on the Thames. Poughley Priory was situated in the\r\nchalk district one and a half miles south of Chaddleworth, and there\r\nare remains of the buildings at a farm. Sandleford Priory is about\r\nthe same distance south of Newbury, and some remains are incorporated\r\nin the modern house which was built after plans by Wyatt in 1781 for\r\nElizabeth Montague (1720-1800) the leader of the Blue-stockings.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned Bisham as an abbey of the Austin Canons,\r\nfounded in 1338, but it had previously been a preceptory of the\r\nKnights Templars. That great military order was however suppressed in\r\nthe time of Edward II and the preceptory dissolved (cir. 1312). The\r\nTemplars also had a preceptory at Brimpton which passed into the\r\npossession of the other great military order of monks, the Knights\r\nHospitallers. Their chapel, which stands close to Brimpton Manor,\r\nstill remains and is an interesting building. Shalford farm, a little\r\nto the east, was also the property of the Hospitallers. The order\r\nwas suppressed in England in 1540, and was only temporarily revived\r\nunder Queen Mary.\r\n\r\nThere were priories in the county belonging to foreign abbeys and\r\nhence termed Alien Priories--one at Steventon belonging to the Abbey\r\nof Bec in Normandy, and the other known as Stratfieldsaye, but in\r\nBerkshire, belonging to the Abbey of Vallemont, also in Normandy. Both\r\nwere abolished in the time of Edward III and there are no remains\r\nof buildings. A farm named the Priory near Beech Hill occupies the\r\nplace of the latter, which was on the site of an old hermitage.\r\n\r\nThere were colleges at Shottesbrook, Windsor, and Wallingford. They\r\nwere houses of priests who performed divine service in the churches\r\nattached to the colleges. We have already mentioned Shottesbrook. There\r\nis a very curious alabaster monument to William Throckmorton, one\r\nof the later Wardens of the college, in the chancel of the church\r\nrepresenting him lying in his coffin.\r\n\r\nBesides these religious houses there were houses of Friars at Reading\r\nand Donnington, and a number of Hospitals in the county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. ARCHITECTURE--(C) MILITARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention has already been drawn to the earliest fortifications in the\r\ncounty. They were banks of earth and had probably wooden palisades. In\r\nNorman times fortified residences became common and were usually of\r\nstone. The history of a Norman castle was probably often as follows. In\r\nthe first place a tower called a \"keep\" was built and was protected\r\nby a moat and probably by some earthworks. Then at a later date the\r\nearthworks were replaced by walls, which usually enclosed a larger\r\nspace than the older fortification. The walls were usually strengthened\r\nby towers, but the keep still remained the citadel of the fortress.\r\n\r\nWe know that William the Conqueror built a castle on the chalk hill at\r\nWindsor before the year 1086, but we know nothing of its plan or form,\r\nfor no part of the present castle can be dated before the reign of\r\nHenry II, and even of that time there are only the foundations and part\r\nof the lower story on the south side of the Upper Ward. The imposing\r\nwestern wall of the Lower Ward, with its three towers, belongs to the\r\ntime of Henry III. The Round Tower on its high mound is the keep of\r\nthe castle, and much of it is as old as the time of Henry III. The top\r\npart, however, is modern. Close to the Round Tower is an old Norman\r\ngate which was rebuilt by Henry III and again by Edward III. The\r\ngateway could be closed by doors and also by a portcullis or grille\r\nlet down from above, and the portcullis is still in its place ready\r\nto be lowered.\r\n\r\nThe view of Windsor Castle given on p. 2 is taken from the\r\nBuckinghamshire bank of the river Thames and shows the north side\r\nof the castle. On the left are the buildings which contain the state\r\napartments; in the centre is the Round Tower. To the right we see St\r\nGeorge's Chapel with its great west end window, and still further to\r\nthe right is the Clewer or Curfew Tower with the pointed roof. The main\r\npart of this tower dates from Henry III, and it has been used as a bell\r\ntower since the time of Edward III.  The pointed roof is modern. St\r\nGeorge's Hall (p. 78) is in the part of Windsor Castle known as the\r\nState Apartments, and in it the feasts of the Knights of the Garter are\r\nheld. It is an old hall, but was much altered by Sir Jeffry Wyatville,\r\nthe architect employed by George IV to repair the castle. There was\r\nnearly always a well in the keep of a Norman castle, and this was\r\nthe case at Windsor, the well in the Round Tower being 160 feet deep.\r\n\r\nThere is a great rectangular earthwork at Wallingford which may go back\r\nto Roman or early British times, but in any case it was adopted by the\r\nNormans and a castle was built on the site. The mound on which the keep\r\nwas built still exists, but little else of these buildings survives.\r\n\r\nNo remains of the castle at Newbury exist. It stood on the south\r\nbank of the river Kennet and was built about 1140. The mound upon\r\nwhich the keep stood is all that we have left of the castle of the\r\nSt Walerys at Hinton Waldrist, and a moated enclosure by the side of\r\nthe river Loddon is all that remains to mark the site of the castle\r\nnamed Beaumyss, built by one of the De la Beche family in 1338.\r\n\r\nOf Donnington Castle near Newbury we have the remains of some walls\r\nand a gateway with two round towers. The walls are mainly flint with\r\nsome stones of various sorts intermingled. There are stone courses and\r\nstone door and window frames. Repairs have been made with brick. The\r\ncastle was built in the time of Richard II. It stands upon a hill or\r\nspur which runs out in a southerly direction from the plateau named\r\nSnelsmore Common, and it overlooks the valley of Newbury. On the west\r\nand south there is a steep slope down towards the river Lambourn,\r\nand on the east is a deep valley in the chalk. On the north the slope\r\nup to the Common is gradual, and so the position is a very strong\r\none. Donnington Castle played an important part in the Civil War of\r\n1642-9, and underwent a long siege in 1644-6.\r\n\r\nIn former times dwelling places, even though not fortified, were at\r\nleast protected by a moat. The interesting old manor house of Ashbury\r\nis still moated on three sides, and the old moat remains in a more\r\nor less perfect state round many a farm in the county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20. ARCHITECTURE--(D) DOMESTIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe churches of the eleventh and succeeding centuries which remain\r\nare well adapted for their use now, but this cannot be said of the\r\ndwelling-houses of Norman or Edwardian landowners, and this is one\r\nreason why we have but few left in anything like perfect condition. The\r\nresidence of the chief landowners of the twelfth century, when not a\r\ncastle, consisted of a hall, usually on the ground floor, but sometimes\r\nwith a lower story half below the surface level, and the hall was not\r\nonly a reception and dining room, but was also the sleeping place\r\nfor the greater number of the persons living in the house. In many\r\ncases there were, no doubt, subsidiary chambers, which might serve\r\nas more or less private apartments for the landowner himself, and as\r\ntime went on the number of the subsidiary chambers increased and the\r\nimportance of the hall diminished, but it impressed itself so firmly\r\non the popular mind that the word still remains in use for the house\r\nof the landowner, which is often spoken of as \"the Hall.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a doorway belonging to a hall of the Norman period at Appleton\r\nin the northern part of the county, and we have already noticed\r\nsome remains of the residential buildings of the monks of Abingdon,\r\nbelonging to the thirteenth century. At Charney, about seven miles to\r\nthe west of Abingdon, there are some interesting remains of a building\r\nwhich was occasionally the residence of the Abbots. The private\r\nchapel and much of the house are still standing. These buildings,\r\nknown as the \"Monks House,\" date from the thirteenth century and are\r\nincorporated in a modern house.\r\n\r\nThere are two old houses at Sutton Courtney south of Abingdon. The\r\none is opposite the tower of the church, and is of Norman and Early\r\nEnglish style, the second is a manor house of the time of Edward III,\r\nthe hall of which, with its roof and windows, has been very little\r\naltered. Cumnor Hall has vanished, excepting a fragment of wall,\r\nbut some of the windows and a doorway are still to be seen in Wytham\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that one reason why few old dwelling-houses\r\nremain is that they would not be suited to modern requirements,\r\nbut another reason is that they were often built of wood. In the\r\nfifteenth century buildings of timber and brick became common,\r\nand some of them remain at the present day. Ockwells, rather more\r\nthan a mile south-west of Maidenhead station, was probably built\r\nin the time of Edward IV. It was for some time the residence of the\r\nNorris family (see page 138). The house was not fortified, and is of\r\ntimber and brick with a tiled roof. One may gain a good idea of the\r\nappearance of the dwellings of our ancestors in Tudor times from the\r\nHorseshoe Cloisters in Windsor Castle, though they were practically\r\nrebuilt recently by Sir Gilbert Scott. Timber and brick farmhouses\r\nand cottages may be seen all over the county, belonging to all dates\r\nfrom the Tudor times to the present day.\r\n\r\nMany of the most beautiful private houses in England were built\r\nduring the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and we have some examples in\r\nBerkshire. Shaw House, about a mile north-east of Newbury, was built\r\nin 1581. It is of red brick, with tall brick chimneys and a tiled\r\nroof. The corners of the house and the window and door frames are\r\nof stone, and in fact there is a good deal of stone. The house was\r\noccupied by Charles I on the day of the second battle of Newbury,\r\nOctober 27th, 1644, and the remains of earthworks thrown up by his\r\ntroops are still to be seen in the garden. Billingbear, near Binfield,\r\nis an Elizabethan house standing in a large and beautiful park.\r\n\r\nUfton Court, near Aldermaston, was built in the latter part of the\r\nsixteenth century.  Farmhouses of the same period are to be seen\r\nat Lyford, west of Abingdon, East Hendred, Great Coxwell and at\r\nother places.\r\n\r\nSecret rooms are often to be found in old houses. There is an example\r\nat Bisham Abbey, with a fireplace, the chimney of which is said to\r\nbe connected with that of the hall, so as to prevent its smoke being\r\nobserved. At Ufton Court there are several hiding-places, one of\r\nwhich has an exit to the open air. It is said that Charles I passed\r\nthe night of November 19th, 1644, in a secret room at the manor house,\r\nWest Shefford.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 some houses which stood on the site of the former ditch of\r\nWindsor Castle were removed, and a passage was found cut through the\r\nchalk, with stone steps and stone arching. It had probably been a\r\nsecret way from the interior of the Castle to the moat.\r\n\r\nWe have many buildings in Berkshire belonging to the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Coleshill House, south-west of Faringdon, was built by\r\nthe celebrated architect Inigo Jones (1572-1652) at the time of the\r\nCommonwealth, and he also built most of Milton House, near Steventon,\r\nin which village are some beautiful old houses. Buscot House, in\r\nthe north-west corner of Berkshire, is an example of the comfortable,\r\nthough not very beautiful mansions built at the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The residential part of Windsor Castle dates in part from\r\nthe reign of Henry II, but it has been greatly altered from time to\r\ntime. Its present appearance is largely due to Sir Jeffry Wyatville\r\n(1766-1840), who modified and rebuilt a great deal in the time of\r\nGeorge IV. His object was to make the Castle a comfortable residence\r\nand at the same time to preserve the appearance of an ancient fortress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21. COMMUNICATIONS--ANCIENT AND MODERN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ridge Way is one of the oldest roads in England. It enters\r\nBerkshire on the chalk downs above Ashbury at a level of 600 feet\r\nabove the sea, and runs in an easterly direction by Wayland Smith's\r\nCave and Uffington Castle; thence by Hackpen Hill to Letcombe Castle,\r\nalong the top of the ridge north of West and East Ilsley. From here,\r\nturning to the right across the little valley on Compton Downs, the\r\nroad probably reached the river Thames at Streatley. This old road is\r\nalso known as the Icknield Way, and there is another old road named\r\nthe Port Way, which follows the valley north of the chalk downs,\r\nrunning through Ashbury and Wantage. It is marked on the maps as\r\na Roman road, and probably both roads were in use in Roman times,\r\nthough the Ridge Way at least is almost certainly of much older date.\r\n\r\nThe Roman road from Marlborough to Silchester followed much the same\r\nline as the modern road from Hungerford to Speen near Newbury, but\r\nthere does not seem to be any trace of the road from that place to\r\nSilchester. The Roman road from Cirencester to Silchester ran by way\r\nof Baydon and Wickham, joining the Marlborough road at Speen. There\r\nis but little trace of the Roman road from Silchester to Dorchester\r\nin Oxfordshire, but the Silchester and London road is fairly well\r\nmarked, and part of it, as we said in a former chapter, is known as\r\nthe \"Devil's Highway.\"\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages the roads were exceedingly bad, and even in the\r\nseventeenth century they were far from satisfactory. Pepys mentions,\r\nin his Diary, June 16th, 1668, that he lost his way driving from\r\nNewbury to Reading. This, it will be observed, was in the summer,\r\nand one would think on a well-known road.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century the roads were gradually improved, and\r\ntowards the end of the century began to be kept in good order for\r\nthe coaches, which were also rapidly improving.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century two mail coach routes\r\nran through Berkshire.\r\n\r\nThe road from London to Gloucester entered Berkshire at Maidenhead\r\nand left the county at Henley. After passing through Oxford it again\r\nentered Berkshire, and ran by Cumnor and Fyfield to Faringdon. From\r\nthat place it ran by Buscot Park and crossed the river Isis at St\r\nJohn's Bridge near Lechlade.\r\n\r\nThe London and Bath mail route ran through the county by Maidenhead,\r\nReading, Newbury, and Hungerford.\r\n\r\nBesides these mail-coach routes there were several roads in the county\r\nwhich came under the head of \"turnpike roads.\" The term turnpike\r\nroad means a road having toll-gates or bars on it. The toll-gates\r\nwere first constructed about the middle of the eighteenth century,\r\nand were called turns, and the turnpike road was one upon which those\r\nwho refused to pay toll could be turned back. Turnpike roads are now\r\npractically extinct and a new species of highway called main roads\r\nhas taken their place. The cost of repair is borne partly by the\r\ncounty and partly by the Local Highway Authority.\r\n\r\nCanals and Rivers. Canals have to a large extent been superseded by\r\nrailways in these days. It is, however, possible that the advent\r\nof cheap motor traction may cause them to revive. The Kennet and\r\nAvon Canal runs from Newbury, and entering Wiltshire near Hungerford\r\nfurnishes a waterway from the Thames to the Severn. The navigation of\r\nthe river Thames is improved by a number of weirs and locks, most of\r\nwhich have been re-made in recent times, and if more useful they are\r\nmuch less picturesque than in former days. The level of the river at\r\nHambleden weir is just about 100 feet above the sea. The river Kennet\r\nis also provided with a series of weirs and locks. A canal which ran\r\nfrom Wantage to Abingdon is now disused.\r\n\r\nThe bridges over the rivers are for the most part modern, but many of\r\nthem replace older structures, indeed most of the crossing-places are\r\nvery old. The bridge at Abingdon was originally built in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and was under the charge of the Guild of the Holy Cross, and\r\nMaidenhead Bridge was the property of a corporation from early days.\r\n\r\nRailways. The Great Western Railway enters Berkshire at Maidenhead,\r\nand runs by way of Reading to near Goring, where it crosses the Thames\r\ninto Oxfordshire, returning into Berkshire near Moulsford. It then\r\npasses by way of Didcot into Wiltshire, which county is entered a\r\nlittle before the line reaches Swindon. An important branch of the\r\nGreat Western runs from Didcot to Oxford, and another branch of the\r\nsame railway from Reading to Newbury, Hungerford, etc. Express trains\r\nto the west of England pass over both the Didcot and the Newbury\r\nline, and in these days they are frequently run from Paddington to\r\nfar beyond the Berkshire border without a stop.\r\n\r\nThe Great Western has branch lines to Windsor, to Cookham for High\r\nWycombe, to Henley, to Wallingford, to Abingdon, and to Faringdon,\r\nand also a rather important line from Reading to Basingstoke, giving\r\na communication from Oxford to the south coast. There is also a light\r\nrailway with auto-cars running between Newbury and Lambourn which\r\nbelongs to the Great Western.\r\n\r\nThe Didcot, Newbury, and Southampton Railway runs from the first-named\r\nplace in a southerly direction, crossing the Reading and Newbury line\r\nat right angles.\r\n\r\nThe South Eastern and Chatham Railway Company have a branch line\r\nrunning to Reading. It enters Berkshire near the village of Sandhurst.\r\n\r\nThe London and South Western Railway have branches to Windsor and\r\nto Wokingham, and from the latter place run trains over the South\r\nEastern line to Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22. ADMINISTRATION AND DIVISIONS--ANCIENT AND MODERN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe division of the county into Hundreds dates from Saxon times. Each\r\nHundred was governed by a High Constable, or Bailiff, and formerly\r\nthere was a Court of Justice, called the Hundred Court, which was\r\nheld regularly for the trial of causes, but this court fell into\r\ndisuse. By various Acts of Parliament the Hundred is made liable for\r\ndamage caused to persons by riots.\r\n\r\nIn early days most of Berkshire was divided amongst different manors,\r\nand each manor had a Manorial Court or Court Baron.\r\n\r\nIt has been already explained in Chapter 3 that the present\r\nadministrative county differs somewhat from the geographical county,\r\nand as the town of Reading with a tract around it has been formed\r\ninto the \"County Borough of Reading\" it is not for most administrative\r\npurposes a part of the county of Berks.\r\n\r\nThe chief officials of Berkshire, under His Majesty the King, are\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant, the Custos Rotulorum, and the Sheriff. The first\r\ntwo of these offices are usually held by the same person.\r\n\r\nThe office of Lord Lieutenant dates from about the time of Edward IV,\r\nand he was formerly the chief military officer of the Crown in the\r\ncounty. The Custos Rotulorum is the first amongst the justices, but\r\nthe High Sheriff has precedence in the county. The Custos selects the\r\ncounty magistrates, and they are appointed by the Lord Chancellor. The\r\noffice of Custos dates from the time of Edward III. He is nominally\r\nthe keeper of the County Records, but in these days they are in fact\r\nin the charge of the Clerk of the Peace.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff was originally elected by the people in the county, but\r\nsince the time of Edward II he has been appointed by the Crown. He was\r\nthe agent through whom the King collected his dues, and in time became\r\nthe military as well as the judicial and executive head of the county\r\nand headed the posse comitatus or power of the county. During the Wars\r\nof the Roses his influence became less, and the Lord Lieutenant took\r\nhis place to some extent. It is recorded in Domesday Book that Godric\r\nthe Sheriff of Berkshire gave a lady with the name of Aluuid half an\r\nacre of the royal domain as a present for teaching his daughter the\r\nart of gold embroidery.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff is the first man in the county, taking precedence of all\r\npeers and of the Lord Lieutenant. He is appointed annually.\r\n\r\nThe county is divided into Petty Sessional divisions for magisterial\r\npurposes, and the Court of Quarter Sessions is a general meeting of all\r\nthe justices of the county. In boroughs, Reading, Abingdon, Newbury,\r\nand Windsor, the Court of Quarter Sessions is held by a Recorder.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the county (not including Reading, which is a County\r\nBorough of itself) are managed by the County Council, which was\r\nestablished by statute of 1888, and by District and Parish Councils,\r\nwhich were established by an Act of 1894. The county is divided\r\ninto eleven districts, Bradfield, Windsor, Cookham, Easthampstead,\r\nWokingham, Newbury, Hungerford, Wantage, Wallingford, Faringdon,\r\nand Abingdon.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the County Borough of Reading are managed by its Mayor\r\nand Corporation.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of Assizes, Berkshire is on the Oxford circuit, and the\r\nCourt is held at Reading. County Courts are held from time to time\r\nat the various towns. The County Court circuits are quite different\r\nfrom the Assize Court circuits.\r\n\r\nFor Parliamentary elections the county is divided into three divisions,\r\nAbingdon, Newbury, and Wokingham, each of which returns one member\r\nto Parliament. Reading also returns a member to Parliament, and so\r\ndoes Windsor, but the Parliamentary borough of Windsor includes a\r\nconsiderable tract outside Berkshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23. PUBLIC AND EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe municipal buildings at Reading were erected during the period\r\n1875-1897, and consist of two Town Halls, the Borough Council offices,\r\na Free Library, the Museum, and an Art Gallery. On the walls of the\r\nreading-room there is a good collection of views of Reading and of\r\nthe river Thames.\r\n\r\nThe Town Hall at Windsor was built by Sir Christopher Wren. On the\r\nexterior there are statues of Queen Anne and her husband, Prince George\r\nof Denmark. The Town Halls at Wokingham and Newbury are modern brick\r\nbuildings. The Cloth Hall at the latter place, now a museum, is very\r\ninteresting. It was built by the Guild of Clothworkers of Newbury,\r\nwhich was incorporated in 1601, and has a picturesque wooden cornice\r\nand wooden pillars, and a red tiled roof.\r\n\r\nThe Town Hall at Wallingford dates from 1670, and is supported by\r\npillars, leaving an open undercroft. The Abingdon Town Hall has also\r\nan undercroft and dates from 1677. It is said, however, to have been\r\ndesigned by Inigo Jones, who died in 1652. There is an interesting\r\nold Town Hall at Faringdon.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Berkshire Hospital at Reading was opened in 1839, and\r\nthere are many hospitals, homes, and orphanages in various parts of\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nThe Prison at Reading stands upon part of the site of Reading\r\nAbbey. There is a large County and Borough lunatic asylum at Moulsford,\r\nand a very large criminal lunatic asylum at Broadmoor, in the eastern\r\nend of the county.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Military College, Sandhurst, is one of the chief Government\r\ninstitutions for the education of officers for the army. It was built\r\nin 1812, and though quite plain in style, the long frontage on a rising\r\nground, above a fine lake, is distinctly effective. The Staff College\r\nis in the same grounds, but is in Surrey. Considerable additions are\r\nnow (1910) being made to the buildings at the Military College.\r\n\r\nWellington College, also near Sandhurst, was built as a public school\r\nby public subscription in memory of the great Duke of Wellington,\r\nwho died in 1852. By the end of 1858 a sum of £145,785 had been\r\nreceived. This included a grant of £25,000 from the Patriotic Fund. The\r\nbuildings are of red brick with stone corners, etc., and were completed\r\nin 1859. They have, however, been greatly added to since. The chapel\r\nis by Sir Gilbert Scott. The first head master was Edward White Benson,\r\nwho subsequently became Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nBradfield College is another important public school, founded by\r\nThomas Stevens in 1850. The buildings are of red brick and flint,\r\nand are partly old. There is an open-air theatre where Greek plays\r\nare performed.\r\n\r\nRadley College is beautifully situated by the river Thames. The site\r\nwas part of the property of the Abbots of Abingdon, and passed through\r\nthe hands of the families of Stonehouse and Bowyer. Much of the old\r\nmansion is incorporated in the college buildings. The college was\r\nfounded by the Rev. William Sewell, D.D.\r\n\r\nUniversity College, Reading, is a comparatively new establishment,\r\nand the buildings are still in process of construction. Higher\r\nteaching in literary and scientific subjects is given, and there is\r\nan Agricultural Department, a Dairy Institute, and a Horticultural\r\nDepartment. There has been a school at Reading from quite early times,\r\nbut its history has been a somewhat broken one. In 1783 John Lempriere\r\npublished his Classical Dictionary whilst an assistant master at the\r\nschool, and Richard Valpy was its head master for 55 years (1781-1836).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above there are several important recognised\r\nsecondary schools at Abingdon, Bracknell, Clewer, Maidenhead, Newbury,\r\nWallingford, Wantage and Windsor.\r\n\r\nThere are many almshouses in Berkshire, the most interesting of\r\nwhich is Christ's Hospital, Abingdon. It is of brick and timber with\r\nan open gallery (p. 63). It was founded under its present name by\r\nCharter of Edward VI, but had a previous existence. The almshouses\r\nnear Wokingham, built 1663, and known as Lucas Hospital, are a good\r\nexample of seventeenth century brickwork, and are very picturesque. The\r\nJesus Hospital at Bray was founded in 1627 for 40 poor persons. It\r\nis a most attractive red brick building, with a quadrangle in the\r\nmiddle, and a small chapel, the windows of which have stone frames\r\nwhich were probably taken from an older building. The quadrangle is\r\nshown in the picture by Frederick Walker in the Tate Gallery, named\r\n\"The Harbour of Refuge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24. THE FOREST IN BERKSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWindsor Forest consisted in early times of a tract of wood and\r\nheath which even before the Norman Conquest was looked upon as\r\nCrown property. It is one of the five forests mentioned by name in\r\nDomesday. It was no doubt of great extent, but its boundaries are not\r\nknown even if they were ever very clearly defined. There is in the\r\nBritish Museum a volume of maps and plans of Windsor by John Norden,\r\nmade in the early part of the reign of James I, and the map of the\r\nforest shows that it was at that time bounded by the Thames on the\r\nnorth, by the Loddon on the west, by the Blackwater on the south,\r\nand that it extended to the east into Surrey as far as the Hog's Back,\r\nGuildford, and the river Wey.\r\n\r\nThe forest was at that time divided into 16 walks, each under a\r\nKeeper. Two of these, Cranbourne and New Lodge Walks, appear to\r\nhave been previously known as Cranbourne Chase, and together with\r\nEgham Walk were the part of the forest lying nearest to the castle,\r\nand including what is now the Home Park and the Great Park. The other\r\nwalks in Berkshire were Swinley Walk, Easthampstead Walk, Sandhurst\r\nWalk, Bigshot Walk, Bearwood Walk, and Warfield Walk. There was also\r\na large district extending from Maidenhead and Bray to Wokingham and\r\nTwyford, which was called the Fines Bayliwick, and of which Sir Henry\r\nNeville claimed to be Keeper by inheritance.\r\n\r\nSeveral parks are marked in the forest. Of these the Little Park is\r\nnow the Home Park, Windsor, and the Great Park and Moat Park are in\r\nthe present Windsor Great Park. Sunninghill Park, Foliejon Park,\r\nEasthampstead Park, and Bagshot Park, the last mostly in Surrey,\r\nstill remain.\r\n\r\nBesides the Parks there were certain enclosed places called\r\nRails. Cranbourne Rails is in Windsor Park. Swinley Rails was until\r\nrecently the place where the deer for the Royal Hunt were kept,\r\nand Bigshot Rails is apparently the place now named Ravenswood,\r\nnear Wellington College.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century there was a great deal\r\nof discussion as to the rights of the Crown over Windsor Forest,\r\nand in 1813 an Act of Parliament was passed dealing with the matter,\r\nand the Forest is now enclosed either as Crown land or as the property\r\nof private persons. Ascot Race Course is in the old Swinley Walk.\r\n\r\nWalter Fitz Other was appointed by William the Conqueror Castellan,\r\nor Governor of Windsor Castle, and Warden of the Forest; and the\r\noffice, which has become known as that of Constable of the Castle,\r\nhas existed from his appointment to the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25. ROLL OF HONOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Alfred was born at Wantage in the year 849, and his statue by\r\nCount Gleichen stands in the market place. The exact site of the\r\npalace of the Kings of Wessex, in which he was born, is not known,\r\nprobably it was a wooden building. Edward III and Henry VI were both\r\nborn at Windsor; Henry I was buried at Reading; Henry VI, Edward IV,\r\nHenry VIII, Charles I, George III, George IV, and William IV were\r\nburied at Windsor; and Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort lie\r\nin the mausoleum at Frogmore, in Windsor Park. King Edward VII was\r\nburied at Windsor May 20, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe Marshals of Hampstead Marshall were a family of warriors. The most\r\ndistinguished of them was William, first Earl of Pembroke. When he\r\nwas a child his father, John Marshal, was besieged at Newbury by King\r\nStephen, 1152, and William was given as a hostage for a truce and the\r\nsurrender of Newbury Castle. The father did not keep his terms, and the\r\nchild would have been killed had not Stephen taken a liking to him and\r\nsaved his life. He became a great soldier and served Henry II, Richard\r\nI, John, and Henry III with the utmost fidelity, becoming Regent of\r\nEngland during the early part of the reign of Henry III. He died in\r\n1219 at Caversham, and is buried in the Temple Church in London.\r\n\r\nIn later times another warrior owned Hampstead Marshall. This was\r\nWilliam Craven, Earl of Craven (1606-1697). He fought in the German\r\nwars of 1632-37 and was the faithful champion of Elizabeth Queen of\r\nBohemia, the only daughter of James I. At the Revolution of 1688,\r\nthough over 80 years old, he was in command of the King's Guards,\r\nand Macaulay, in his History of England, describes how unwillingly the\r\nstout old soldier made way for the Dutch troops at Whitehall. Ashdown\r\nPark was another seat of the Earl, and is still in the possession of\r\nhis descendant.\r\n\r\nRadley belonged to a gallant sailor, Admiral Sir George Bowyer,\r\nBart. (1740?-1800), who lost a leg off Ushant, June 1st, 1794. Another\r\nAdmiral, Samuel Barrington (1729-1800), is buried at Shrivenham. He\r\nserved under Hawke and Rodney, and was commander-in-chief in the\r\nWest Indies.\r\n\r\nThe family of Norris or Norreys has long been connected with\r\nBerkshire. Richard de Norreys, a member of a Lancashire family,\r\nheld the office of cook to Eleanor, wife of Henry III, and in 1267\r\nthe manor of Ockholt, near Maidenhead, was granted to him. One of\r\nhis descendants, John Norris, who held office in the Court of both\r\nHenry VI and Edward IV, built the house Ockwells at Ockholt, which\r\nhas been already mentioned on page 114. He was buried at Bray in\r\n1467. One branch of the family settled at Fyfield, and another branch\r\nbecame Norris of Rycote, which is in Buckinghamshire, but they too\r\nheld much Berkshire property. Hampstead Norris derives its second\r\nname from this family. Henry Norris was an intimate friend of Henry\r\nVIII, and was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He, however,\r\nfell under the suspicion of being a lover of Anne Boleyn, and was in\r\nconsequence executed in 1536. His son, also named Henry, was created\r\nBaron Norris of Rycote in 1572. He died at Englefield, and there is a\r\nmonument to him and to one of his six soldier sons, Sir John Norris,\r\nin Yattendon church. Francis Norris, a grandson of Henry Lord Norris,\r\nwas born at Wytham, and in 1621 was created Earl of Berkshire. He left\r\nno sons, and the earldom became extinct at his death, 1623. The barony\r\ndescended through two ladies, Elizabeth and Bridget, to James Bertie,\r\nwho was created Earl of Abingdon 1682. The present peer, whose seat\r\nis Wytham Abbey, is the seventh Earl of Abingdon.\r\n\r\nSt Edmund (1170?-1240), Archbishop of Canterbury, was born at\r\nAbingdon, and William Laud (1573-1645), also Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nwas born at Reading, the only son of William Laud, a clothier. He\r\nwas educated at the Free School at Reading, and he gave a farm to\r\nReading for charitable purposes. It was sold a short time ago, and\r\nthe purchase money invested, producing some £330 a year. Another\r\ncharity at Wokingham established by him also still exists.\r\n\r\nJohn Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury (1522-1571), was for some time\r\nvicar of Sunningwell. He was a voluminous writer on theological\r\nsubjects. Another churchman connected with Sunningwell was John\r\nFell (1625-1686), Bishop of Oxford, who was born either there or at\r\nLongworth. His father was rector of the parish. In 1648, at the time\r\nof the Civil War, he was turned out of his Studentship at Oxford, but\r\ncontinued to celebrate the rites of the church in a house opposite\r\nMerton College. He was a distinguished man, but is best known by\r\nthe lines referring to him which begin \"I do not love thee, Doctor\r\nFell.\" Joseph Butler (1692-1752), Bishop of Durham, and the author of\r\nthe Analogy of Religion Natural and Revealed to the Constitution and\r\nCourse of Nature, was born at Wantage, the son of a retired draper\r\nwho lived at the Priory.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hoby (1505-1558) and his half-brother, Sir Thomas Hoby\r\n(1530-1566), were both distinguished diplomatists. The former\r\nreceived the manor of Bisham from Henry VIII, and they are both buried\r\nthere. Queen Elizabeth was domiciled at Bisham under the charge of\r\nthe Hobys for a time during the reign of her sister Mary.\r\n\r\nSir John Mason, another diplomatist of the same period, was the son\r\nof a cowherd at Abingdon. He is described as a paragon of caution,\r\ncoldness, and craft, and held high office, diplomatic and political,\r\nunder Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth, being in favour\r\nwith all these sovereigns.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Unton, or Umpton, who died in 1596, was both diplomatist\r\nand soldier of the time of Elizabeth. He was born at Wadley Hall,\r\nnear Faringdon, where the Queen visited him in 1574. The house\r\nis still standing. There is a fine alabaster monument to him in\r\nFaringdon church.\r\n\r\nIn 1626 the title of Earl of Berkshire was conferred on the Hon. Thomas\r\nHoward, of Charlton, Wilts. He was a son of the Earl of Suffolk,\r\nand in 1745 the two titles passed to one man, and are so held at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lenthall (1591-1662), the Speaker of the House of Commons in\r\nthe Long Parliament, bought Besselsleigh, the house of the ancient\r\nfamily of Besils, and his descendants still own it.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn (1644-1718), the Quaker and founder of Pennsylvania,\r\nthough London-born, lived at Ruscomb, near Twyford, for some time\r\ntowards the end of his life and died there.\r\n\r\nPassing now to authors, Henry Hallam (1777-1859), the historian, was\r\nborn at Windsor, the son of one of the canons. Catherine Sawbridge\r\n(1731-1791), who became in turn Mrs Macaulay and Mrs Graham, was the\r\nauthoress of a History of England. In her later years she lived at\r\nBinfield and is buried in the churchyard there. The antiquary, Thomas\r\nHearne (1678-1735), was the son of the parish clerk at White Waltham,\r\nand was born at Littlefield Green.\r\n\r\nJethro Tull (1680-1741), a well-known writer on agriculture, was\r\nborn at Basildon, and farmed land first near Wallingford, then in\r\nOxfordshire, and finally near Hungerford. About the year 1701 he\r\ninvented a horse-drill for sowing seed. He is buried at Basildon.\r\n\r\nSir William Blackstone (1723-1780), of the Commentaries, was buried\r\nin St Peter's, Wallingford, at which place he had spent much of\r\nthe latter part of his life. John Shute, first Viscount Barrington\r\n(1678-1734), author of the History of the Apostles, lived at Beckett\r\nHouse, Shrivenham, which was left to him by Sir John Wildman.\r\n\r\nSeveral poets were connected with Berkshire, but chief of them all\r\nwas Alexander Pope (1688-1744), whose father owned a small property\r\nat Binfield. Here the poet lived for much of the early part of his\r\nlife. His poem Windsor Forest contains many lines dealing with the\r\ndistrict around Binfield. Sir William Trumbull (1639-1716), the friend\r\nof Pope, and Secretary of State in 1695, lived at Easthampstead, not\r\nfar from Binfield; and Elijah Fenton (1683-1730), another of Pope's\r\nfriends, himself a poet, lived with the Trumbull family during his\r\nlast years.\r\n\r\nHenry James Pye (1745-1813), though Poet Laureate, wrote but poor\r\nverses. He commuted the tierce of canary to which the Poet Laureate\r\nwas entitled for £27 a year. He was a son of Henry Pye of Faringdon,\r\nand at one time was M.P. for Berkshire. Joshua Sylvester (1563-1618),\r\nalso a poet, is said to have lived at Lambourn as steward to the\r\nancient family of Essex, and one of his volumes is dedicated to\r\nMistress Essex of Lambourn.\r\n\r\nMrs Elizabeth Montague (1720-1800), whose London house was a centre of\r\nintellect and fashion, where the term \"Blue-stocking\" was first applied\r\nto her conversation parties, lived a good deal at Sandleford Priory,\r\nnear Newbury, and built a large house there from plans by Wyatt.\r\n\r\nShe cannot, however, claim the close connection with Berkshire, both as\r\nregards life and writings, which is so characteristic of Mary Russell\r\nMitford (1787-1855) who lived for a time at Reading, then at Three\r\nMile Cross, and finally at Swallowfield, in the churchyard of which\r\nplace she lies buried. Her best known work is Our Village, the scenes\r\nin which are laid in the district at and around Three Mile Cross.\r\n\r\nThomas Day (1748-1789), the author of Sandford and Merton, was the\r\nowner of Bear Hill, Wargrave.\r\n\r\nJohn Winchcombe, alias Smalwoode (died 1520), was a pioneer of the\r\nclothing manufacture at Newbury, and acquired thereby great wealth. He\r\nbuilt a house at Bucklebury on land which had belonged to the Abbey\r\nof Reading. His descendant, Frances Winchcombe, married in 1700 the\r\ncelebrated Viscount Bolingbroke, who resided at Bucklebury for a\r\ntime. John Winchcombe is buried in Newbury church. He was popularly\r\nknown as \"Jack of Newbury\" and many fables are told about him. Thomas\r\nDeloney, a weaver by trade, who lived in the latter part of the\r\nsixteenth century, wrote the ballad \"The Pleasant History of John\r\nWinchcomb, in his younger days called Jack of Newbury.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26. THE CHIEF TOWNS AND VILLAGES OF BERKSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(The figures in brackets after each name give the population of the\r\ntown or parish in 1901, and those at the end of the sections give\r\nthe references to the text.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbingdon (6441). A municipal borough in the Abingdon division of\r\nthe county. It is situated at the junction of the river Ock with\r\nthe Thames, 61 miles from Paddington by railway, and 56 miles from\r\nLondon by road. It was incorporated by Charter granted by Philip and\r\nMary in 1555. Its trade is mainly in agricultural produce, and its\r\nmanufactures are carpets, woollen goods, and sacking.
