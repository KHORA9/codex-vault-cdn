The remainder of the passengers and\r\ncrew of this ill-fated ship, were most inhumanly murdered by the savages\r\nsoon after they landed from the wreck. The Narrative was written by one\r\nof the Orphans, John Ireland, and I give it to you in nearly his own\r\nwords, having made but few alterations in the style in which he tells\r\nthe story of their sufferings.\r\n\r\nThe people of some of the South Sea Islands, are of a very cruel\r\ndisposition; some of them are cannibals; that is, they eat the flesh of\r\nthose unfortunate persons who may happen to be shipwrecked on their\r\nIslands, or whom they may take prisoners of war. Others, on the\r\ncontrary, show the greatest kindness to strangers in distress. May the\r\ntime soon come when civilization and the Christian religion shall reach\r\nall these benighted savages, and teach them to relieve the distressed,\r\nand to regard the unfortunate as their brethren.\r\n\r\nAs very little is yet known of the manners and customs of these savage\r\ntribes, I trust this Narrative will prove both interesting and\r\ninstructive to you all; and I hope you will feel grateful that,—unlike\r\nthe sufferers in this story,—you are surrounded with the comforts of\r\nlife, and have kind parents and friends to watch over you and defend you\r\nfrom the dangers and miseries to which these poor Orphans were so long\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\n                                        Your old friend and well-wisher,\r\n                                        THOMAS TELLER.\r\n\r\n _Roseville Hall_, 1844.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  THE\r\n                          SHIPWRECKED ORPHANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHaving obtained a situation as assistant in the cabin of the ship\r\nCharles Eaton, I went on board on the 28th of September, 1833, to assist\r\nin preparing for the voyage. In the month of December following, I had\r\nthe misfortune to fall into the dock, and not being able to swim,\r\nnarrowly escaped drowning; but through the exertions of Mr. Clare, the\r\nchief officer of the ship, I was with difficulty saved.\r\n\r\nAbout the 19th of December, we left the dock, with a cargo mostly of\r\nlead and calico. Our crew consisted of the following persons: Frederick\r\nMoore, commander; Robert Clare, chief mate; William Major, second mate,\r\nMessrs. Ching and Perry, midshipmen; Mr. Grant, surgeon: Mr. Williams,\r\nsail-maker; William Montgomery, steward; Lawrence Constantyne,\r\ncarpenter; Thomas Everitt, boatswain; John Barry, George Lawn, James\r\nMillar, James Moore, John Carr, Francis Hower, William Jefferies, Samuel\r\nBaylett, Charles Robertson, and Francis Quill, seamen; and John Sexton,\r\nand myself, boys. The passengers were, Mr. Armstrong, a native of\r\nIreland, and twenty-five male and female children from the Emigration\r\nSociety, with some other steerage passengers.\r\n\r\nWe had a favorable passage down the river to Gravesend, where we took\r\nleave of our pilot. A pilot is a person who takes charge of the ships in\r\nthose parts of rivers where they are dangerous. On the 23d of December\r\nwe went on our voyage, passing Deal on the 25th, and arrived at Cowes,\r\nin the Isle of Wight, on the 27th.\r\n\r\nThe wind here proved contrary, and we were detained in the harbor until\r\nthe 4th of January, 1834; when, as we were attempting to quit, a\r\nschooner ran against our vessel and broke off our bowsprit and jib-boom,\r\nand did other damage to her. The bowsprit is the mast that sticks out in\r\nfront of the ship, and the jib-boom is the top joint of the bowsprit. We\r\nwere therefore obliged to remain there until the repairing of the ship\r\nwas completed; and on the 1st of February left Cowes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Manner in which the Murray Islanders spearfish—a female assisting._\r\n  See Page 41.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis accident caused great alarm among the passengers, and more\r\nespecially among the children; indeed it was well that we escaped as we\r\ndid; for even in our own harbors in England, ships are often in great\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Falmouth, near Land’s-end in Cornwall, on the 5th of\r\nFebruary; and having on the 8th completed our cargo, left England with a\r\ngood wind, and every prospect of a happy voyage.\r\n\r\nAbout the latter end of March, we crossed the Equator; that is, that\r\npart of the world where the sun is over head and makes no shadow; here\r\nwe went through the usual ceremony of paying tribute to Neptune, to the\r\ngreat amusement of the passengers.\r\n\r\nWe came to the Cape of Good Hope, which is in Africa, on the 1st of May,\r\nand here we landed several of our passengers; we again set sail, on the\r\n4th, for Hobart’s Town, in Australia, upwards of twenty thousand miles\r\nfrom England, where we arrived on the 16th of June; at this place we\r\nbade farewell to our young emigrants, and some of the passengers.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of July, Captain and Mrs. Doyley, with their two sons, George\r\nand William, the one about seven or eight years old, and the other about\r\nfourteen months, came on board as passengers to Sourabaya, intending to\r\ngo from thence to Calcutta, in the East Indies. William, the youngest,\r\nwas my unfortunate companion.\r\n\r\nNothing particular occurred after our leaving Hobart’s Town, till we\r\narrived in Sidney, in New South Wales, on the 13th of July. There we\r\ntook in some ballast; that is, heavy articles which are put in the\r\nbottom of the ship to keep it from turning over with the wind. Our\r\nboatswain, Mr. Everitt, left us at Sidney, and we took on board in his\r\nstead Mr. Pigot, and two or three seamen.\r\n\r\nWe set sail for China on the 29th. An accident happened two or three\r\ndays after leaving the town, which almost caused the death of our\r\nexcellent chief officer, Mr. Clare. An anchor is an iron instrument\r\naffixed to the end of a long chain, and is used to keep ships in one\r\nplace. It generally hangs at the bows, or fore part of the vessel. The\r\nmen were getting the anchor in its proper place, and Mr. Clare was\r\nhelping them; on a sudden, the wood of the implement which he was using\r\nbroke, and he fell into the sea. We immediately stopped work, and let\r\ndown the boat, and he being an excellent swimmer, was able to keep up\r\ntill the boat reached him. We were at that time going about six miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nWe sailed this time with fine weather and good winds, and made the\r\nentrance to Torres Straits, a narrow passage between two islands in the\r\nSouthern Ocean, on the 14th of August, in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe wind now began to blow rather hard; so much so that the captain\r\nthought it necessary to take in some of the sails, and would not attempt\r\nto go on during the dark. However, at daylight on the next morning we\r\nagain set sail, although the wind was very high, and the water getting\r\nrough, that is, forming itself into large waves.\r\n\r\nThe wind continued to increase till about ten o’clock in the morning,\r\nwhen the ship struck on a reef called the “Detached Reef.” A reef is a\r\nnumber of rocks in the water, at a short distance from the land, over\r\nwhich the water just rises, without leaving room enough for a ship to\r\npass. The Detached Reef was near the entrance of Torres Straits.\r\n\r\nSo violent was the shock, that the rudder (that by which a ship is\r\nguided,) and the keel, (that ledge which runs along the bottom of the\r\nship,) were both knocked off, and the captain gave it as his opinion\r\nthat nothing could save the ship.\r\n\r\nThe chief mate cut away the masts, in order to lighten her; but without\r\neffect, and we then found that the bottom was broken in, at which place\r\nthe water soon made an entrance, and completely spoiled every thing she\r\ncontained. The high and swelling waves broke completely over her, and in\r\na short time the vessel was a perfect wreck.\r\n\r\nIt was happy for us that the upper part kept together as it did, though\r\nthere was so much danger, from the water rising, that every one expected\r\nto be washed over. There was plainly to be heard above the din of the\r\nwind and sea, the horrible groaning of the planks forming the sides of\r\nthe ship, between which the water rushed as through a sieve; and as they\r\nwere one by one broken away from the ill-fated vessel, we felt that we\r\nwere approaching nearer to a death from which we could not hope to\r\nescape, unless by some merciful interposition of Divine Goodness we\r\nshould be rescued from our watery enemy.\r\n\r\nNor were these thoughts lessened by seeing that ours was not the only\r\nvessel that had cause to repent the dangerous and almost unknown\r\nnavigation of these straits. About three or four miles from us, to the\r\nwindward, or that side from which the wind blows, we observed a ship\r\nhigh and dry, that is, lying out of water, upon the reefs; she had her\r\nmasts standing, her royal yards across, and her sails set; in which\r\nstate she had seemingly been left by her crew.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the vessel striking, Mrs. Doyley was taking coffee in the\r\ncabin, and her infant was asleep in one of the berths, little dreaming\r\nto what future ills his weak and helpless frame was to be exposed.\r\n\r\nThe distracted mother instantly ran on deck in alarm; and I went into\r\nthe cabin, where I saw the poor child washed out of its berth, and\r\ncrying on the floor. I took him to Mrs. Doyley, who, after that time,\r\nfor the seven long days which were occupied in making the raft, could\r\nnot by any means be persuaded to give up her dear charge.\r\n\r\nUpon finding how the ship was situated, Captain Moore ordered the boats\r\nto be got ready, and furnished with provisions, in order, if possible,\r\nto save the ship’s company, and reach the island of Timor, regretting\r\nthe stern necessity which urged him to such a step in such a sea.\r\n\r\nI once heard Captain Moore declare that he was sorry he had not made use\r\nof his own chart, instead of one that he bought at Sidney, lest there\r\nmight be any mistake in his own.\r\n\r\nWe were in possession of four boats; the long boat, two cutters, and a\r\nsmall boat called a dingy. Three of the seamen seized one of the\r\ncutters; and two others got on board of it next morning by swimming\r\nacross the reef at the imminent peril of their lives. A little biscuit,\r\na ham, and a keg of water, with some carpenters’ tools, had been placed\r\nin the boat on its leaving the ship. As soon as the two men had got into\r\nthe boat, they rowed away, and I have never heard any tidings of them\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThe persons remaining on board the wreck now held a consultation as to\r\nwhat was best to be done in this miserable state of their affairs. There\r\nwere about thirty persons, without sufficient provisions to sustain\r\nlife, much less satisfy the cravings of hunger, for a month, without any\r\nfresh water, and with no prospect of escape from their forlorn\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nEvery care was requisite to prevent the least excess or extravagance. We\r\nwere all put upon allowance of a few damaged pieces of biscuit and two\r\nwine-glassfuls of water per day, during the seven days of making the\r\nraft, which was our only hope, and on which we went to work with all the\r\nenergy our desperate state allowed us. A raft is formed of pieces of\r\nwood roughly fastened together, so that it will float on the water; some\r\nhave been made large enough to hold a hundred and fifty people.\r\n\r\nThe poop, or raised part of the deck, and one side of the forecastle, or\r\nfront part, being washed away, the small part of it that remained was so\r\ncrowded that we were almost always in one another’s way, although as\r\nmany as could were working at the raft. All the provision that we could\r\nsave, and that was very little, and all the materials wanted for our\r\nwork, were obliged to be put on this small space, for the water rose\r\nfour feet higher than the deck below, and broke away some of the planks\r\nand timbers every time the tide rose.\r\n\r\nAs the tide went down, we dived into the body of the ship, to try to get\r\nsome of the ship’s stores, and with the hopeless idea of getting\r\nsomething to satisfy our hunger; but the bottom was so washed away that\r\nthe hold could not contain any thing which might have been in it at the\r\ntime of the storm.\r\n\r\nMrs. Doyley and her husband gave every stimulus to exertion; and the\r\nkind manner in which they requested us to make use of any of their\r\nclothes, part of which were the only ones saved, I shall ever remember\r\nwith gratitude.\r\n\r\nWe managed, however, to distil a small quantity of water, of which a\r\ncask and a few bottles were saved for the raft, by boiling it in the\r\nship’s coppers, and leading the steam by means of a pipe, through the\r\nquarter galley cistern, and catching the water thus made in a cask. The\r\nsupply of this valuable article thus procured, small as it was, we found\r\nto be one of our greatest helps during our stay upon the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe raft was completed, as well as the difficulties that we had to\r\novercome would permit, in seven days; and the water, with a cask of pork\r\nand some biscuit, being put upon it, we all followed; but it was not\r\nsufficiently buoyant for all; that is, it was not light enough to keep\r\nus up; so the greater part of us returned to the wreck, leaving upon the\r\nraft, the captain, Mr. Moore; the surgeon, Mr. Grant; Captain and Mrs.\r\nDoyley, and their two children; their black nurse, a native of India;\r\nand Mr. Armstrong, with two seamen, named Lowine and Berry; who\r\ndetermined to remain on it all night.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, however, we found the rope by which the raft had been\r\nmade fast to the stern or back part of the vessel was cut, and we could\r\nsee nothing of our late companions.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the uncomfortable situation in which they were\r\nplaced, up to their waists in water, induced Captain Moore to cut the\r\nrope, and trust to the wind and sea to carry them to a place of safety.\r\nThe gale had abated, and the sea lulled, during the time we were making\r\nthe raft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _The unhappy crew got on the raft, cut the rope and bade adieu to the\r\n    wreck of the Charles Eaton._\r\n  See page 17.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThose who had returned on board set to work to make another raft of the\r\nship’s topmasts, lashed or tightly tied together with rope. A topmast is\r\nthe top joint of a mast. We also made a sail of some of the cloth of the\r\nship’s cargo.\r\n\r\nWe worked with the greatest diligence, but did not complete it for about\r\na week. We then got upon it, with all the food we could get, which was\r\nonly a few pieces of damaged biscuit; we cut the rope, and bade adieu to\r\nthe wreck of the Charles Eaton.\r\n\r\nWhat our feelings were at that time, I can scarcely describe. The fear\r\nthat the adventure we had undertaken would not turn out to advantage;\r\nthe certainty of death if we remained; the hope of again reaching our\r\nnative country, were each brought in turn to mind, and acting upon our\r\nalready half-starved condition, made us almost incapable of using the\r\nlittle strength of which we had not been deprived, and we took our\r\nplaces on the raft in a silence which showed the height of our despair.\r\n\r\nThe vessel that we saw with her masts standing, was too far off to\r\nwindward for us to reach; I do not think a boat could have been rowed up\r\nto her, against the wind and tide, which were both against us, and the\r\ncurrent running very strong, so we gave up the idea as hopeless.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had cast off, we set our sail, and steered along with the\r\nwind; but our raft was so heavy and deep that the progress we made was\r\nvery slow. We drifted, rather than sailed, and that at a rate of not\r\nmore than a mile or a mile and a half an hour.\r\n\r\nWe came to a reef, upon which we stayed all night; the next morning we\r\nagain set sail on our perilous voyage before the wind, but saw no more\r\nreefs. We were two more days and nights upon the raft, up to our waists\r\nin water, and with a very small allowance of food. This was soon all\r\neaten. We then passed an island, and saw several more ahead.\r\n\r\nSoon after we had passed the first island, we saw a canoe paddling\r\ntowards us, containing ten or twelve native Indians. A canoe is a rude\r\nkind of Indian boat. As they came towards us, they extended their arms,\r\nwhich we supposed meant that they were unarmed, and wished to be\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\nOn their reaching the raft, several of them got upon it, and were gently\r\nput back by Mr. Clare; he at the same time saying that he thought from\r\ntheir manners that they were not to be trusted. They were very stout\r\nmen, and quite naked.\r\n\r\nAn event happened, which, at another time, would have afforded much\r\namusement, but now, was a serious loss. One of the Indians, attracted no\r\ndoubt by a piece of white cloth that was hanging to the top of our mast,\r\nclimbed up it; when the desired cloth was within his reach, the mast\r\nbroke, and he was thrown into the sea, without receiving any injury.\r\n\r\nWe gave the natives a looking glass and a piece of red cloth, with which\r\nthey appeared very much pleased, and began to make signs to us to get\r\ninto their canoe. We at first hesitated to do so, until Mr. Ching, the\r\nmidshipman, said he would go; as he thought by that means to get sooner\r\nto England; at any rate, he said, he could not be worse off.\r\n\r\nUpon his going into the canoe, we all agreed to go too, and left the\r\nraft; on which the Indians commenced a strict search for iron and tools;\r\nbut could find nothing but a few old hoops. These they collected and put\r\ninto the canoe.\r\n\r\nIt was about four in the afternoon when we left the raft; and after\r\npassing three islands on our right, and one on our left, we landed on an\r\nisland which I afterwards found the natives called Boydan. We could\r\nplainly see the main land, about fourteen or fifteen miles distant. The\r\nisland was very small.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we landed, we made signs that we were hungry. The natives\r\nwent with us round the island in search of food and water. We were\r\nunsuccessful; not having found so much as a drop of water. When we\r\nreturned to the place where we landed, hunger and fatigue had so\r\ncompletely exhausted us that we could scarcely walk.\r\n\r\nThe Indians now began to show signs of their ferocious disposition. They\r\nstood around us, grinning and yelling in a most hideous manner, as\r\nthough delighting in the success of their schemes, and feeling fresh\r\ndelight at our showing how great was our increasing pain.\r\n\r\nMr. Clare now said we had better prepare for the worst; indeed it was\r\nvery plain that the Indians were only watching an opportunity to kill\r\nus. He read some prayers from a book which he had brought from the\r\nwreck; and we all most heartily joined with him in supplication. We felt\r\nthat probably it would be our last and only opportunity while here on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _The savages of Boydan treacherously murdering the crew of the Charles\r\n    Eaton while they are sleeping._\r\n  See page 24.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHow true is the admonition which warns us that “in the midst of life we\r\nare in death.” But little did the wanderers who set out in the frail\r\nvessel, in all the gaiety of health and strength, imagine what was to be\r\ntheir melancholy fate, what would be their sufferings, or what the\r\nhorrible termination of their existence.\r\n\r\nAfter having spent some time in prayer, we threw ourselves on the\r\nground, in expectation of being killed. Although it will readily be\r\nimagined we were little in heart disposed to slumber, yet such was the\r\nstate to which we were reduced, that most of us fell almost immediately\r\ninto a sound sleep. The natives, seeing us lying down, appeared anxious\r\nthat we should go to sleep; which they signified to us by putting their\r\nhead on one shoulder, and closing their eyes.\r\n\r\nI felt quite sure, from one thing, that mischief was intended. I saw one\r\nof the natives advance from a canoe in a strange manner; stealing\r\ncautiously along with a club in his hand, hid as he thought from our\r\nsight, behind his back, and which he dropped upon the beach. I told this\r\nto the seaman, Carr, who was lying next to me; but he, being very\r\nsleepy, seem to take no notice of it, and soon after was in a deep\r\nsleep. Not long after this, I observed with dread, that as the people\r\nfell asleep, a native placed himself between every two of us; yet I was\r\nso overcome with weariness and weakness, I fell asleep too. This I have\r\nno doubt, was for the more easy execution of the horrid purpose they\r\nintended, that of murdering us, without giving us a chance for escape or\r\ndefence. It was utterly out of our power to resist; as we had not so\r\nmuch as a staff or stick to defend ourselves with; and our exhaustion\r\nwas too great to allow us to quit the place where we then were.\r\n\r\nAbout as near as I can guess, an hour after I had been asleep, I was\r\nawoke by a terrible shouting and noise. I instantly arose, and on\r\nlooking round, I saw the natives killing my companions by dashing out\r\ntheir brains with clubs. The first that was killed was Mr. Ching, and\r\nafter him his companion, Mr. Perry; the next victim was Mr. Major, the\r\nsecond officer.\r\n\r\nThe confusion now became terrible, and my agitation at beholding the\r\nhorrid scene was so great that do I not distinctly remember what passed\r\nafter this. The last person that I recollect seeing alive was Mr. Clare;\r\nwho in an attempt to escape, was overtaken and immediately murdered by a\r\nblow on the head.\r\n\r\nMyself and John Sexton were now the only two remaining alive. An Indian\r\ncame to me with a carving knife in his hand, which I could see belonged\r\nto the cabin, and recollected its being put on the first raft. He seized\r\nme, and tried to cut my throat; but I grasped the blade of the knife in\r\nmy right hand, and held it fast. I struggled hard for my life. He at\r\nlast threw me down, and placing his knee upon my breast, tried to wrench\r\nthe knife out of my hand; but I still kept it, though one of my fingers\r\nwas cut to the bone. I at last succeeded in getting upon him, and then I\r\nlet go my hold, and ran into the sea.\r\n\r\nI swam out a little way; but the only chance for my life being to return\r\nto shore, I landed again, expecting to be killed on the spot. The same\r\nIndian then came towards me in a furious manner, and shot an arrow at\r\nme, which struck me in my right breast. On a sudden, however, he, very\r\nmuch to my surprise, became quite calm, and led, or rather dragged me to\r\na little distance, and offered me some fish. This, hungry as I was, I\r\nwas afraid to eat lest it should be poisoned.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay with these people, I have frequently seen them fly into a\r\nviolent rage, and recover themselves in a moment, becoming quite calm,\r\nas was the case with the man who had tried to take my life.\r\n\r\nWhilst struggling with the Indian, I saw Sexton, who was held by\r\nanother, bite a piece out of his arm. After that, I knew nothing of him,\r\nuntil I found that his life was spared in a manner something similar to\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\nNot very far off, the other savages were dancing round a large fire,\r\nbefore which they had placed in a row, the heads of our unfortunate\r\ncompanions, whose bodies, after being stripped of their clothes, were\r\nleft on the beach, and I should think the tide soon washed them away,\r\nfor I never saw them afterwards. From these heads, I saw the savages,\r\nevery now and then, cut pieces of flesh from the cheeks, and pluck out\r\nthe eyes, and eat them, shouting most hideously. This, I afterwards\r\nlearned, it was the custom of these islanders to do with their\r\nprisoners; they think that it will give them courage, and excite them to\r\nrevenge themselves upon their enemies.\r\n\r\nSexton and myself were taken up to the fire, where some of the natives\r\nsat like tailors, dividing the clothes and other articles which they had\r\ntaken from the bodies of the persons killed. We were given into the care\r\nof two of the natives, who covered us with a sort of mat, that formed\r\nthe sail of the canoe. My wounds, which were still bleeding very much,\r\nthey did not pay the least attention to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Horrible and cruel ceremony of the Boydan Islanders._\r\n  See Page 30.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to describe our feelings during this dreadful\r\nnight. We fully expected, every moment, to share the fate of those whom\r\nwe had so lately seen cruelly murdered. We prayed together for some\r\ntime, and after each promising to call on the other’s relations, should\r\neither ever escape, we took leave of each other, giving ourselves up for\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nAt length the morning came; and the Indians, after having collected all\r\nthe heads, took us with them in their canoes to another island, which\r\nthey called Pullan, where the women lived. On landing, I saw Captain\r\nDoyley’s two children, and a Newfoundland dog, called Portland, which\r\nbelonged to the ship.\r\n\r\nThe Indians took us to some open huts which they had in the island, and\r\nplaced us before a fire; I saw there the gown worn by Mrs. Doyley at the\r\ntime she left the wreck, the steward’s watch and white hat, and several\r\nother articles of clothing, which belonged to those of the crew who left\r\nthe ship in the first raft.\r\n\r\nNear the huts a pole was stuck in the ground, around which were hung the\r\nheads of our unfortunate companions. Among them I plainly recognized\r\nMrs. Doyley’s, for they had left part of the hair on it; and I knew\r\nCaptain Moore’s by the face.\r\n\r\nEvery morning about sunrise, and every evening at sunset, one of the\r\nnatives went close to the pole, and blew seven or eight times through a\r\nlarge shell; which made a noise somewhat like blowing through a cow’s\r\nhorn; at the same time looking up steadfastly at the heads.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the other people decked themselves with the green branches\r\nof trees, and some painted or rather rubbed their bodies over with a\r\nkind of ochre, of a red color and white, and came to the pole with great\r\nparade, holding their clubs and spears. Then they made a sort of\r\ncorrobory, or dance; but I could not trace any signs of religion in\r\nthese ceremonies, nor detect any thing like reverence paid to the pole.\r\n\r\nI asked George Doyley what had become of his father and mother? He told\r\nme that they were both killed by the blacks, as well as all those who\r\nwent away from the ship in the first raft, excepting himself and his\r\nlittle brother.\r\n\r\nThe little fellow gave a very distinct account of the dreadful\r\ntransaction. He said he was so frightened when he saw his father killed\r\nby a blow on the head from a club, that he hardly knew what he did; but\r\nwhen his mother was killed in the same way, he thought they would kill\r\nhim and his little brother too, and then he hoped they should all go to\r\nheaven together. I then told him that all the crew, except myself and\r\nSexton, were murdered.\r\n\r\nAfter we had been on the island a few days, a vessel came in sight, and\r\nI did all I could to induce the natives to take us to it; but they would\r\nnot part with us. Seven days afterwards, two more ships, in company,\r\ncame close to the shore. The natives seemed very much frightened at\r\nthis, and were in the utmost confusion; they took us, and all the\r\nskulls, with the dog, and hid us among the bushes until the ships were\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nWe were very scantily supplied with provisions during our stay on the\r\nisland. When the natives had been unsuccessful in fishing, they would\r\neat it all themselves; and at other times, when they caught a good\r\nsupply, they gave us the entrails and heads. This, with a sort of wild\r\nplum, and now and then a piece of cocoa-nut, which we got without their\r\nknowledge, was our only food.\r\n\r\nWe were sometimes so hungry as to be glad to eat the grass. Through\r\ndoing this, I have often been attacked with such violent pains in the\r\nstomach, as made me unable to walk upright.\r\n\r\nLittle William Doyley was very ill-used during our stay here; he cried\r\nvery much after his mother; and at times the natives, both men and\r\nwomen, would tie him up to a tree, and beat him with bamboos; on my\r\nasking them to leave off, as well as I could by signs, they would shoot\r\nat me with their bows and arrows. On one occasion, when the women were\r\nbeating him, I went and released him, and very nearly lost my life, for\r\nan arrow was shot within an inch of my head. They sometimes tied him up\r\nand left him several hours.\r\n\r\nSexton and myself were chiefly employed in climbing trees, and breaking\r\nup fire-wood to cook the fish with; when they thought we had not enough,\r\nthey would beat us with their hands, and sometimes with the wood.\r\n\r\nThey would at times take us with them in their canoes, to catch fish,\r\nwhich they did by spearing, and with lines and hooks. Their lines were\r\nmade of the fibres of the outside shell or husk of the cocoa-nuts; and\r\nthe hooks were neatly made of tortoise shell.\r\n\r\nThe number of Indians on this island amounted to about sixty. They were\r\nmerely residing on the island during the fishing season; for their home,\r\nas I afterward found out, was a great distance off.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining here, as near as I can recollect, three months, (for I\r\nhad almost lost all remembrance of dates) the Indians separated. One\r\nparty took me and William Doyley with them in a canoe; and George Doyley\r\nand Sexton stayed with the other party.\r\n\r\nThe party that took me along with them, set sail early in the morning,\r\nand about the middle of the day reached another small island to the\r\nnorthward, where we stayed a day and a night; it had a sandy beach. The\r\nnext morning we left this island and went to another, which was very\r\nflat, and covered with low bushes; here we stayed a fortnight. We then\r\nsailed northward, stopping at other islands, as long as we could get\r\nfood for the party; this food consisted of fish and wild fruits; our\r\ndrink was water.\r\n\r\nWe came to one island where we stayed about a month, and from thence\r\nwent to another, which the natives called Aroob, but which I afterwards\r\nlearned was Darnley’s Island. This place I have very good reason to\r\nrecollect; it was here that we were first treated with some kindness by\r\nthe natives. After staying here about a fortnight, we again embarked,\r\nreturning by the way we had come, to an island called by the natives\r\nSirreb, situated near to Aureed.\r\n\r\nPoor little William seemed to wish to stop on any of the islands where\r\nwe landed; and cried for a long time after being on board the canoe, to\r\nreturn to them.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining on this island rather more than a week, a canoe, with\r\nsome of the natives of Murray’s Island, came there. They bought us of\r\nour captors for two bunches of bananas. We did not leave the island for\r\nthree days after we were bought; but in that time went in the canoe with\r\nour new masters, who treated us very kindly. I was pleased to find that\r\npoor little William began to become more cheerful.\r\n\r\nWe returned by way of Darnley’s Island, stayed there a few days, and\r\nthen went to Murray’s Island, where we afterwards lived until the period\r\nof our release by Captain Lewis, in the Isabella.\r\n\r\nUpon our first landing on Murray’s Island, the natives flocked around\r\nus, wondering who we were. They began asking those who had brought us a\r\ngreat many questions, and speaking to us in a language very nearly like\r\nthat of the other natives, and which I was just beginning to understand.\r\nSome of the children were very much frightened at us, and ran away as\r\nsoon as they saw us.\r\n\r\nI soon learned that the name of the person who bought me was Dupper; and\r\nlittle William was given into the care of a native called Oby, who lived\r\nnear Dupper’s hut. This man soon got very fond of the little boy, as the\r\nchild also became of him; indeed he seemed here to have quite forgotten\r\nhis mother and father.\r\n\r\nMy name among these people, was Waki, and that of William, was Uass. I\r\nlived in the same hut with Dupper and his family, consisting of himself,\r\nhis wife Panney, three sons, to all appearance young men, and two\r\ndaughters, who were called Yope and Sarki.\r\n\r\nIn this place I was made as comfortable as I could expect, under the\r\ncircumstances in which I was placed; my wounds had continued open during\r\nmy wanderings, but they now began to heal, and my appearance soon\r\naltered for the better. I had now gone through all that could be called\r\nsuffering; but still I constantly wished that some European vessel would\r\ntouch at that shore, and take me once more to see my friends and\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMy new master (I should have called him father, for he behaved to me as\r\nkindly as he did to his sons,) gave me a canoe, about sixty feet long,\r\nwhich he purchased at New Guinea, (the island that forms one side of the\r\nstraits, Australasia being the other,) for a large tomahawk and a bow\r\nand arrow. He also gave me a piece of ground, on which he taught me to\r\ngrow yams, bananas, and cocoa-nuts. When we were not otherwise engaged,\r\nhe taught me to shoot with the bow and arrow, and to spear fish.\r\n\r\nLittle William soon began to speak their language; and I also learned so\r\nmuch of it as to be able to converse in it with great ease; having no\r\nother than natives to speak to, it is more than probable that as I\r\nlearned their language, I should have forgotten that of my native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAlthough William was in general more cheerful, he would now and then\r\nappear very uneasy. On these occasions, I used to ask Dupper to allow me\r\nto sleep along with the child. This made him much more happy. As soon as\r\nhe could speak their language pretty freely, he would go down to the\r\nbeach with the other children of the island; and the effect of the sun\r\non his skin became very apparent. In a few months he could not be\r\ndistinguished by his color from the other children; his hair being the\r\nonly thing by which he could be known at a distance, from its light\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _The kind Murray Islander teaching John Ireland the use of the Bow and\r\n    Arrow._\r\n  See page 36.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMurray’s Island is about two miles across, and contains about seven or\r\neight hundred people. During my stay there, I never perceived any person\r\nwho was in any manner above the rest of the natives, as regarded being a\r\nking, or chief, or any thing of that kind; but the whole of the\r\ninhabitants seem entirely independent of each other.\r\n\r\nThe houses or huts of the natives are something in the form of a\r\nbee-hive, with a hole in the side, even with the ground, and about two\r\nfeet and a half in height, which serves for an entrance. When you go in,\r\nyou must creep upon your hands and knees. They are made by placing a\r\npole upright in the ground, and putting stakes round it in a circle at\r\nequal distances: these are then all bent inwards, and fastened together\r\nnear the top of the pole, to which they are firmly bound.\r\n\r\nThe outside is then covered with dried banana leaves, which are very\r\nlarge. The entrance is merely a place in the side left uncovered. The\r\npole, or supporter, is generally ornamented with shells; and at the top\r\nof it, which sticks out above the rest of the hut, they mostly fasten\r\nthe largest one they can find. Some of the huts have a quantity of\r\nskulls arranged round the inside.\r\n\r\nTheir canoes, or boats, are very large, mostly about fifty or sixty feet\r\nlong, and some even larger than that. Two masts, opposite to each other,\r\nwith a sail hanging between them, are placed nearly in the centre, but\r\nmore towards the head of the canoe. The sail is made of plaited grass.\r\nWhen going with a side wind, they put one of the masts backwards, so\r\nthat the sail stands slantingly. They use paddles of almost every shape;\r\nbut the most general is merely a piece of wood cut flat, and broadest at\r\nthe end which touches the water.\r\n\r\nThey are expert in the use of the bow, which they call sireck; they make\r\nthem of split bamboo; and they are so powerful that persons not\r\naccustomed to using the bow, would scarcely be able to bend them. Their\r\narrows are pieces of wood made heavy at one end by a piece of stone or\r\nshell, sharpened at the end.\r\n\r\nTheir clubs are made of a hard black wood; the handle is made small, and\r\nhas a knob at the end to prevent its slipping out of the hand.\r\n\r\nThey are very fond of all sorts of European articles; especially beads,\r\nglass, red cloth, bottles, and particularly of iron, which they call\r\n‘torre.’ When they see a ship, they say directly, “We will get some\r\ntorre.” They think iron is found in the white men’s country in large\r\nrocks; and that we merely have to break pieces off as we want them.\r\n\r\nOf all things, they were most inquisitive about fire-arms, which they\r\ncall by the same name as they do their bows. Dupper told me that some of\r\ntheir people had been killed by them, and they never could see what\r\nstruck them. But I could not explain to him the way that a gun was made,\r\nfor I scarcely knew myself; all I could tell him I did, but this only\r\nmade him the more curious.\r\n\r\nTheir usual way of catching fish is by spearing; but they also take the\r\nsmall ones with a kind of net, something like a sieve. One party\r\ndisturbs the water, by beating it with long bamboo sticks, and so drive\r\nthe fish towards the other, who then spear or net them. Lobsters are\r\ncaught in the following manner: a party will get on a sandbank at night,\r\nsome of them holding a bunch of lighted cocoa-nut leaves above their\r\nheads; the lobsters, seeing the light, leave their holes, and are then\r\nspeared by the others.\r\n\r\nTurtles abound on the islands, and are caught by the natives very\r\ndexterously. When they see them asleep on the water, a party of seven or\r\neight go in a canoe, four of the party paddling very slowly and silently\r\ntowards them, the others squatting on the fore part of the canoe, with a\r\nrope fastened to their arms, and only their heads above the side of the\r\ncanoe. Upon getting near enough, the parties in the canoe suddenly leap\r\nout, and catch the turtle by the fins; by which they are then hauled\r\ninto the boat. I have seen three caught at one time in this manner.\r\n\r\nAfter I had resided some months on this island, a native died in one of\r\nthe huts near Dupper’s. Upon his telling me of the event, he said he was\r\ncertain something very dreadful would happen soon. This remark of\r\nDupper’s startled me; for it was the first death I had known on the\r\nisland, and I could not help thinking of the fate of the crew of the\r\nCharles Eaton. An idea once or twice entered my mind that harm was\r\nintended to me on account of the death of this man; but Dupper treated\r\nme just the same as usual. Soon after sunset I went to rest, still\r\nfeeling very uneasy. I had not lain very long, when I heard a noise, as\r\nof a person rattling shells, and breathing very hard.\r\n\r\nDupper uttered a short sentence in a language which I did not\r\nunderstand, and quite different from that of Murray’s Island, and then\r\nhimself and all that were in the hut, hid their faces in the sand. I\r\nasked Dupper what the noise was; he told me, the spirit of the dead man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _John Ireland sees the extraordinary apparitions which cause such\r\n    superstitious terrors among the Murray Islanders._\r\n  See page 45.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe next day, I and some of the natives, with little William, were\r\nsitting under a bamboo fence, close to the huts, when I heard the same\r\nnoise a short distance off. On looking among the bushes, I saw two\r\nfigures, the one red and the other white, with what appeared to be a fan\r\nover each of their heads. They began throwing stones at us; and the\r\nnatives, who were about twenty in number, instead of getting up and\r\ndriving them away, sat still, and seemed to be totally unnerved. The\r\nfigures were very short, not larger than children fourteen years of age.\r\nI was told that they were the spirits of their departed friends.\r\n\r\nI have since taken a great deal of trouble to ascertain what these\r\nfigures were; for they made me very uneasy. I took particular notice of\r\nthem at the time, and have searched through all the huts; but never\r\ncould discover any traces of dresses similar to those worn by the\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nThe club is their principal weapon: with it they endeavor to strike the\r\nhead; and one blow is generally fatal. Their spears, which they throw\r\nwith great accuracy, are made of bamboo, with points made of sharpened\r\nshells. They also use them in their hand with great dexterity.\r\n\r\nTheir bows are very dangerous instruments of warfare; as they sometimes\r\npoison their arrows. Being naked, they often get a slight scratch from\r\none of these, and as they have no remedy for the poison, they die a\r\npainful and lingering death.\r\n\r\nI was one afternoon sitting upon one of the hills in the island, when I\r\nsaw a ship coming round a point of the island. My thoughts now turned\r\nupon the possibility of reaching this vessel, which approached nearer\r\nand nearer, and appeared as if intending to stop at the island. There\r\nwas a merry-making in the village on that day: but my desire to leave\r\nthe savage life, prevented me from taking part in it as usual; in fact,\r\nI wanted to draw the attention of those on board to myself before the\r\nnatives should see her; but could not tell how to do so, the ship being\r\nso far off.\r\n\r\nI did not attain my object, notwithstanding all my endeavors. As soon as\r\nthe ship was observed, Dupper, as he usually did when a vessel came in\r\nsight, painted my body black, with a streak of red on the bridge of my\r\nnose, extending along my forehead, over each of my eye-brows. My ears\r\nhaving been pierced on my arrival at Murray’s Island, his wife and\r\ndaughters hung tassels, made of plaited grass, to them. They also put\r\nornaments round my neck, body, arms, wrists, and ancles.\r\n\r\nWhen the ship came near enough to us for their glasses to make\r\nobservations, the natives broke branches off the trees, and waved them.\r\nI did the same myself, and, to my unspeakable joy, saw her come near to\r\nthe shore and drop her anchor. I then thought my deliverance certain;\r\nbut was sadly disappointed that no boat came off to the shore. I went\r\ndown to the beach along with Dupper and William, and some of the\r\nnatives, but still no boat appeared, and I waited till the night set in.\r\n\r\nNext morning, soon after sunrise, several canoes went away to the ship,\r\nDupper and myself being in one of them; William was left on the island.\r\nWe were in the third or fourth that got along-side and we dropped\r\ndirectly under the stern.\r\n\r\nA rope was thrown from the vessel into our canoe, and I caught hold of\r\nit, and tried to get on board by it. But I had sprained my wrist, by a\r\nfall, a day or two before, and waving the branch had made it exceedingly\r\npainful, so that I could not climb. One of the crew held out a roll of\r\ntobacco to me, but I could not reach it; so I asked him to lower the\r\nboat for me to get in.\r\n\r\nThe captain and officers were at that time bartering with the natives\r\nfor curiosities and tortoise shell; they had one of the cutters lowered,\r\nbut put their pistols and naked cutlasses into it. When the natives saw\r\nthat, they thought mischief was intended to me and to themselves; they\r\nimmediately let go the rope, and paddled towards the shore. I stood up\r\nin the canoe; but Dupper took hold of me and laid me down in the middle\r\nof it. The boat rowed a little way after us and then returned to the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nA few hours afterwards, the boat came close to the beach, with, I\r\nbelieve, the captain on board, to shoot birds. One of the natives took\r\nlittle William on his shoulders, and went down to the beach, he walked\r\ntowards the boat, and beckoned to the crew to come and take him.\r\n\r\nI had often mentioned to the natives that the white people would give\r\nthem axes, and bottles, and iron, for the little boy; I told them his\r\nrelations were rich, and would be glad to give them a great deal if they\r\nwould let them have him back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _The kind Murray Islander surprised and delighted at perceiving iron\r\n    can be bent by fire._\r\n  See page 51.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe captain made signs for the natives to go nearer to the boat; for he\r\nstopped at some distance; but neither party would approach the other,\r\nand the boat soon after returned to the vessel. I was kept among the\r\nbushes all this time, by Dupper and his sons: but I could plainly see\r\nevery thing that took place. The ship sailed next morning, and we were\r\nboth left on the island. All my hopes of deliverance by means of this\r\nvessel, were thus put an end to.\r\n\r\nThis vessel’s sailing without me, made such an impression upon my mind,\r\nthat for three or four days I could eat no food, and at length became\r\nextremely ill. I think at times I was light-headed, for I did not know\r\nwhat I was doing. When I got better, which was in about a week, the idea\r\nthat I should end my days among the savages settled upon me, and I\r\nbecame quite melancholy.\r\n\r\nMy health after this began visibly to decline; and it grieved me to see\r\nWilliam was also getting thin and sickly; for I had no remedy in case of\r\nillness. Nor did I ever see the natives make use of any thing either to\r\nprevent or cure diseases to which they are subject.\r\n\r\nOne morning, Dupper was trying to straighten a piece of an iron bolt,\r\nand was heating it very hard with a large piece of stone, without being\r\nable to make any impression upon it. I told him to make a large fire,\r\nand put the iron into it, which would soften it. He did so, and his\r\nastonishment was very great when he found it answer the purpose.\r\n\r\nHe was very much pleased with me for this discovery, and often told the\r\nother natives of it. Almost all of them had a piece of iron, obtained\r\nfrom the different wrecks which had happened on the island, or by\r\ntrading with the Europeans; and we were after this frequently employed\r\nin straightening or altering the shape of these iron articles, as it\r\nmight suit the various fancies of their owners.\r\n\r\nAfter we had been about a year on Murray’s Island, Dupper told me that\r\nthe natives intended to go on a trading voyage to Dowder, (this I\r\nafterwards learned was the name they called New Guinea,) and I was to be\r\none of the party.\r\n\r\nFor this journey, twelve large canoes about sixty feet long, each\r\ncontaining from ten to sixteen persons, men, and women, and children,\r\nwere prepared. As many shells as the natives could collect were put into\r\nthe canoes, and we set sail. The natives of New Guinea wear these shells\r\nfor ornaments; and in return for them, the Murray Islanders get canoes,\r\nbows and arrows and feathers.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to Darnley’s Island, Dupper left me in the charge of a\r\nnative of that place, named Agge, telling me he was afraid that the New\r\nGuinea people would steal or murder me. The party did not stay long on\r\nthis island, for the next morning they left me, not expecting to see\r\nthem again for a month.\r\n\r\nHow great was my surprise, when on the following evening, Dupper\r\nreturned to the island where he had left me. I asked him whether he had\r\nchanged all his shells so quickly, or whether any thing serious had\r\nhappened, that he had come back so soon.\r\n\r\nHe told me that they stopped at an island called Jarmuth, to pass the\r\nnight, and that a quarrel ensued between one of the natives of that\r\nisland, and a Murray Islander, named Newboo, and Dupper’s two nephews,\r\nabout a pipe of tobacco. Another of the natives of Jarmuth had attempted\r\nto take from one of the Murray Islanders his moco, an ornament worn\r\nround the calf of the leg, made of the bark of bamboo.\r\n\r\nThese outrages had caused a fight with bows and arrows, in which several\r\nof the Jarmuth people were wounded, and one of them shot through the\r\nbody; but none of the Murray Islanders were hurt. On this account the\r\nvoyage was not taken, but we all returned to Murray’s Island.\r\n\r\nAbout three days after this, the Jarmuth people sent a message offering\r\npeace; but it was not accepted, and they were still unreconciled when I\r\ncame away.\r\n\r\nThe time of our deliverance, however, which we had so long given up as\r\nhopeless, was now near at hand. The years we had passed among the\r\nsavages had not taken from my memory the scenes of home, and happiness,\r\nand England; but since the departure of the last vessel that touched at\r\nthe shore of the island, the thoughts of my friends and relations had\r\ncome to my remembrance as forcibly as if it was only the day before that\r\nhad been passed in their company, and in my mind it was but a week since\r\nevents of the most pleasing kind had happened; and I had brooded over\r\nthese reflections till my body had wasted to a mere skeleton, through\r\nthe melancholy exertions of my mind; aided, no doubt, by the sickness\r\nwhich neglect, thus involuntarily induced, had attacked my weakened\r\nframe.\r\n\r\nI used to delight to tell William about his father and mother; how they\r\nleft a far off country in a large canoe; and of the storm, when he was\r\nnearly killed; how his mother kissed and fondled him to her bosom, when\r\nI brought him to her. Then that he had a brother, who came with us in\r\nthe ship and played with him, till in the storm the ship was wrecked and\r\nbroke to pieces; how we all were nearly starved to death; and at last\r\nescaped on the rafts; that his father and mother, and nurse, with many\r\nmore men, were killed by the natives of Boydan: and we had left his\r\nbrother there among the savages, and had not seen them since; and of\r\nDupper’s buying us, and bringing us to this island, and how kind he was.\r\n\r\nThese recitals would bring tears into the eyes of my young wondering\r\nlistener, showing that the impression was made upon his mind. How his\r\ntears pleased me! His simple questions upon these occasions were\r\nanswered with an eagerness which showed with what deepness thought had\r\nfixed them on my memory. I need not add, how these things made me love\r\nthe infant that God had thus thrown, as I thought, into my charge; nor\r\nhow I resolved to endeavor, as far as my means would enable me, to\r\ncherish and protect him in his helplessness.\r\n\r\nI had asked Dupper to enquire what had become of George Doyley and John\r\nSexton, if he should at any time happen to meet with one of the natives\r\nof Boydan. He could not learn any tidings for a long time; but at length\r\nhe told me that he understood they were both dead.\r\n\r\nSome time after this, I heard two of the natives conversing, and one of\r\nthem said that the youngest white boy at Boydan, (this was George\r\nDoyley,) had got sick and died; and that the other one (John Sexton,)\r\nhad been speared by one of the natives.\r\n\r\nOne evening, Dupper’s brother was obliged to leave his house to do some\r\nbusiness, and some of Dupper’s family, with myself, were asked to go\r\nthere to take care of it during his absence. This house was on the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, I saw a vessel come round the point of the island, and\r\nsoon after drop her anchor near the shore. I immediately went down to\r\nthe beach, where I saw several canoes paddling off. I attempted to get\r\ninto one of them, but Dupper would not let me. I tried very hard to\r\nprevail on him to let me go, but for some time he would not consent. He\r\ntold me to hide myself among the trees on the hills, for he was sure the\r\npeople on board the ship would kill me.\r\n\r\nAfter much persuasion, upon my telling him that I did not want to leave\r\nhim, but only to procure some axes and other articles, he with\r\nreluctance allowed me to get into his canoe. We then went off to the\r\nship. I was fearful lest some misunderstanding should take place, so I\r\nasked Dupper to request silence until I had spoken with the people in\r\nthe ship. The natives accordingly did not speak.\r\n\r\nWhen we got within a short distance, a person hailed me, and asked what\r\nship I came out in. I answered, “In the Charles Eaton.” He then asked me\r\nwhether there were any more white people on the island? I replied, “Only\r\na child about four or five years old.” He then told me to come\r\nalong-side, which I did, and was then taken on board.\r\n\r\nMy agitation was so great, that I could scarcely answer the questions\r\nwhich were put to me; and it was some time before I recovered my\r\nself-possession. Captain Lewis took me down into the cabin, and gave me\r\na shirt, a pair of trowsers, and a straw hat. He ordered some bread and\r\ncheese and beer for me; but the thoughts of again revisiting my home and\r\nfriends prevented me from eating much of it.\r\n\r\nHe asked me what had become of the remaining passengers and crew. I told\r\nhim, as near as I could, all that had happened; that they were all\r\nmurdered, with the exception of five men who had escaped in a cutter. He\r\nthen told me that his ship had been fitted out in search of us. For this\r\nkindness on the part of government, I can not enough express my sincere\r\nthanks, and my sorrow that it should meet with so small a return.\r\n\r\nDupper and several of the natives had come on board, and Captain Lewis\r\ntold me to desire them to bring William. They said he was on the other\r\nside of the island, (this was the case,) but that they would bring him\r\nthe next day. Captain Lewis then said that he would allow no trading\r\ntill the child was on board. Most of the natives returned to the island\r\nin the evening; and those that remained, slept on deck, with a sail to\r\ncover them. Dupper and Oby were allowed to sleep with me.\r\n\r\nNext day, the natives made a great many excuses against bringing William\r\non board; they said he was crying, and would not leave the women. I told\r\nthem that unless they brought him, they would not be allowed to trade.\r\nAbout the middle of the day he was brought. At first, he seemed\r\nfrightened at the strangers, and did not like parting with his old black\r\nfriends; but I did my best to pacify him, and he soon became used to the\r\nnew faces.\r\n\r\nOne of the sailors made him a frock and trowsers, and another gave him a\r\ncap; he looked very curious in them, but at first they made him\r\nuncomfortable. I have the cap now in my possession.\r\n\r\nThe natives of these islands are much given to pilfering. One of them\r\nwas seen taking a knife, and was immediately sent out of the ship. I saw\r\nDupper steal a pair of compasses, but I said nothing about it to any\r\none: I did not like to offend him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _The kind Murray Islander taking leave of the Orphans._\r\n  See page 61.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe next night, Captain Lewis amused the islanders with a display of\r\nrockets, and firing of great guns, with which they were highly\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\nBefore the ship sailed, Dupper went and collected a quantity of\r\ncocoa-nuts, yams, and tobacco, which he brought on board for me. He then\r\nasked who was to have the care of my canoe, bow and arrows, and other\r\narticles? I said, his son Bowdoo; with which he seemed very well\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to feel pained at parting; he cried, hugged me, and then cried\r\nagain; at last he told me to come back soon, and bring him plenty of\r\nthings, and not to forget ‘torre’. I then bade farewell to the poor old\r\nman, and the rest of the natives, who patted and fondled William in his\r\nnew dress, and on Tuesday, the 28th of June, at about eight o’clock in\r\nthe morning, we left Murray’s Island.\r\n\r\nThe Isabella schooner had been fitted out to search the islands for the\r\nwhite people who had been shipwrecked in the Charles Eaton, or might be\r\nleft on them from any shipwreck. I went with the vessel to all those\r\nislands they had not searched before they discovered us; and my speaking\r\nthe language was of great service.\r\n\r\nOn one of the islands, we found a figure made of tortoise shell, painted\r\nsomething like a man’s face, round which were tied forty-five skulls.\r\nThese we took on board. We observed that they were more or less injured.\r\nSeveral of them were supposed to have belonged to Europeans, and one to\r\na woman.\r\n\r\nOur voyage was prosperous, and we arrived at Sidney without any\r\naccident. Great excitement had been caused in this place by the\r\nmelancholy disappearance of so many persons; and the rumor of our story,\r\nand of the fate of the Charles Eaton and crew, made William and myself\r\nobjects of great curiosity.\r\n\r\nI was taken to the governor of the colony, Sir Richard Bourke; to whom I\r\nrelated as much of this narrative as I could recollect. I had forty\r\nshillings given to me by the captain of the Japan, a whaler that we\r\npassed on our journey home. This money enabled me to buy some clothes.\r\nSir Richard Bourke placed some money in the hands of a person in Sidney,\r\nto defray my expenses during the time I stayed there; the remainder of\r\nwhich sum I have received since my arrival in London.\r\n\r\nA lady named Mrs. Slade, whose husband is a government officer in\r\nSidney, hearing that the name of one of the boys brought by the Isabella\r\nwas Doyley, made inquiries respecting him, and found that he was the son\r\nof an old and esteemed friend. She immediately requested permission to\r\ntake charge of poor William; who was accordingly given into her charge.\r\n\r\nOur health, which had been improving during the passage home, now began\r\nto recover quickly. We had every attention paid to us that was possible;\r\nour cancers were subjected to medical treatment, and in a few weeks I\r\nwas completely cured.\r\n\r\nI stayed here five months, hoping to accompany William to England; but a\r\nboy threw a stone at him, which severely hurt his head, and threw him\r\nagain on a bed of sickness, and deferred his departure. At the time I\r\nleft, he was recovering fast.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to be longer dependent on the bounty of any person, and an\r\nopportunity offering, of a situation on board the Florentia, commanded\r\nby Captain Deloitte, bound to London, I took my farewell of William and\r\nmy other kind friends, and went on board in the month of February.\r\n\r\nWe set sail, and experienced a little rough weather on our passage, but\r\narrived in London without accident, in August.\r\n\r\nI had now been absent from England nearly four years; and it is\r\nimpossible to describe my feelings when again putting my foot upon its\r\nlong-desired ground; none but those similarly situated can understand\r\nthem. All I wish the kind reader to do, is to avoid the savages of\r\nBoydan, but lend a helping hand to civilize the kind natives of Murray’s\r\nIsland, and the Indians of Torres Straits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
