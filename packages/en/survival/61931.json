By Owen Chase of Nantucket, first mate of said\r\n  vessel.”\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the Act of the Congress of the United States, entitled\r\n“An Act for the encouragement of Learning, by securing the Copies of\r\nMaps, Charts, and Books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies,\r\nduring the time therein mentioned.” And also to an Act, entitled “an\r\nAct, supplementary to an Act, entitled an Act for the encouragement of\r\nLearning, by securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books, to the\r\nauthors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein\r\nmentioned, and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of designing,\r\nengraving, and etching historical and other prints.”\r\n\r\n                                               JAMES DILL,\r\n                           _Clerk of the Southern District of New-York_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TO THE READER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am aware that the public mind has been already nearly sated with the\r\nprivate stories of individuals, many of whom had few, if any, claims to\r\npublic attention; and the injuries which have resulted from the\r\npromulgation of fictitious histories, and in many instances, of journals\r\nentirely fabricated for the purpose, has had the effect to lessen the\r\npublic interest in works of this description, and very much to\r\nundervalue the general cause of truth. It is, however, not the less\r\nimportant and necessary, that narratives should continue to be furnished\r\nthat have their foundations in fact; and the subject of which embraces\r\nnew and interesting matter in any department of the arts or sciences.\r\nWhen the motive is worthy, the subject and style interesting, affording\r\ninstruction, exciting a proper sympathy, and withal disclosing new and\r\nastonishing traits of human character:—this kind of information becomes\r\nof great value to the philanthropist and philosopher, and is fully\r\ndeserving of attention from every description of readers.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the facts contained in this little volume, they are\r\nneither so extravagant as to require the exercise of any great credulity\r\nto believe, nor, I trust, so unimportant or uninteresting, as to forbid\r\nan attentive perusal. It was my misfortune to be a considerable, if not\r\na principal, sufferer, in the dreadful catastrophe that befel us; and in\r\nit, I not only lost all the little I had ventured, but my situation and\r\nthe prospects of bettering it, that at one time seemed to smile upon me,\r\nwere all in one short moment destroyed with it. The hope of obtaining\r\nsomething of remuneration, by giving a short history of my sufferings to\r\nthe world, must therefore constitute my claim to public attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe increasing attention which is bestowed upon the whale fishery in the\r\nUnited States, has lately caused a very considerable commercial\r\nexcitement; and no doubt it will become, if it be not at present, as\r\nimportant and general a branch of commerce as any belonging to our\r\ncountry. It is now principally confined to a very industrious and\r\nenterprising portion of the population of the States, many individuals\r\nof whom have amassed very rapid and considerable fortunes. It is a\r\nbusiness requiring that labour, economy, and enterprise, for which the\r\npeople of Nantucket are so eminently distinguished. It has enriched the\r\ninhabitants without bringing with it the usual corruptions and luxuries\r\nof a foreign trade; and those who are now most successful and\r\nconspicuous in it, are remarkable for the primitive simplicity,\r\nintegrity, and hospitality of the island. This trade, if I may so call\r\nit, took its rise amongst the earliest settlers, and has gradually\r\nadvanced to the extended, important, and lucrative state in which it now\r\nis, without any material interruption, and with very little competition\r\nuntil the present time. The late war temporally, but in a great degree\r\naffected its prosperity, by subjecting numerous fine vessels with their\r\ncargoes to capture and loss; but in its short continuance, it was not\r\nsufficient to divert the enterprise of the whalemen, nor to subdue the\r\nactive energies of the capitalists embarked in it. At the conclusion of\r\npeace, those energies burst out afresh; and our sails now almost whiten\r\nthe distant confines of the Pacific. The English have a few ships there;\r\nand the advantages which they possess over ours, it may be feared will\r\nmaterially affect our success, by producing in time a much more\r\nextensive and powerful competition. They are enabled to realize a\r\ngreater profit from the demand and price of oil in their markets; and\r\nthe encouragement afforded by parliament, not only in permitting the\r\nimportation of it free of duty, but in granting a liberal bounty. It is\r\nto be hoped that the wisdom of Congress will be extended to this\r\nsubject; and that our present decided supremacy will not be lost for the\r\nwant of a deserved government patronage.\r\n\r\nRecent events have shown that we require a competent naval force in the\r\nPacific, for the protection of this important and lucrative branch of\r\ncommerce; for the want of which, many serious injuries and insults have\r\nbeen lately received, which have a tendency to retard its flourishing\r\nprogress, and which have proved of serious consequence to the parties\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nDuring the late war, the exertions and intrepidity of Capt. Porter, were\r\nthe means of saving a great deal of valuable property, which otherwise\r\nmust have fallen into the hands of the enemy. His skilful, spirited, and\r\npatriotic conduct, on all occasions where he was called upon to act,\r\nimparted a protection and confidence to our countrymen, which completely\r\nfulfilled their expectations of him, and without doubt those of the\r\ngovernment in sending him there.\r\n\r\nOur ships usually occupy from two to three years in making a voyage.\r\nOccasionally, necessity obliges them to go into port for provisions,\r\nwater, and repairs; in some cases, amongst mere savages, and in others,\r\ninhospitable people, from whom they are liable to every species of\r\nfraud, imposition, and force, which require some competent power to awe\r\nand redress. As long as the struggle between the patriots and royalists\r\ncontinues, or even should that speedily end—as long as young and\r\ninstable governments, as there naturally must be for many years to come,\r\nexist there, our whalemen will continue to require that countenance and\r\nsupport which the importance and prosperity of the trade to them, and to\r\nthe country, eminently entitle them. It is, undoubtedly, a most\r\nhazardous business; involving many incidental and unavoidable\r\nsacrifices, the severity of which it seems cruel to increase by the\r\nneglect or refusal of a proper protection.\r\n\r\nThe seamen employed in the fishery, and particularly those from\r\nNantucket, are composed of the sons and connexions of the most\r\nrespectable families on the island; and, unlike the majority of the\r\nclass or profession to which they belong, they labour not only for their\r\ntemporary subsistence, but they have an ambition and pride among them\r\nwhich seeks after distinguishment and promotion. Almost all of them\r\nenter the service with views of a future command; and submit cheerfully\r\nto the hardships and drudgery of the intermediate stations, until they\r\nbecome thoroughly acquainted with their business.\r\n\r\nThere are common sailors, boat-steerers, and harpooners: the last of\r\nthese is the most honourable and important. It is in this station, that\r\nall the capacity of the young sailor is elicited; on the dexterous\r\nmanagement of the harpoon, the line, and the lance, and in the\r\nadventurous positions which he takes alongside of his enemy, depends\r\nalmost entirely the successful issue of his attack; and more real\r\nchivalry is not often exhibited on the deck of a battle-ship, than is\r\ndisplayed by these hardy sons of the ocean, in some of their gallant\r\nexploits among the whales. Nursed in the dangers of their business, and\r\nexposed to the continual hazards and hardships of all seasons, climates,\r\nand weathers, it will not be surprising if they should become a fearless\r\nset of people, and pre-eminent in all the requisites of good seamen. Two\r\nvoyages are generally considered sufficient to qualify an active and\r\nintelligent young man for command; in which time, he learns from\r\nexperience, and the examples which are set him, all that is necessary to\r\nbe known.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject, I may be allowed to observe that it would not be\r\nan unprofitable task in a majority of our respectable shipmasters in the\r\nmerchant service, to look into the principles of conduct, and study the\r\neconomical management of the captains of our whale-ships. I am confident\r\nmany serviceable hints could be gathered from the admirable system by\r\nwhich they regulate their concerns. They would learn, also, what respect\r\nis due to the character and standing of a captain of a whale-ship, which\r\nthose of the merchant service affect so much to undervalue. If the post\r\nof danger be the post of honour; and if merit emanates from exemplary\r\nprivate character, uncommon intelligence, and professional gallantry,\r\nthen is it due to a great majority of the shipmasters of Nantucket, that\r\nthey should be held above the operations of an invidious and unjust\r\ndistinction. It is a curious fact that one does exist; and it is equally\r\nan illiberal, as an undeserved reproach upon them, which time and an\r\nacquaintance with their merits must speedily wipe away.\r\n\r\nThe reader is requested to notice the following errors, which have\r\nresulted from the haste in transcribing the original narrative.\r\n\r\n          Page 23, line  2, for “one vows,” read _are now_.\r\n               44, line 15, for “one,” read, _none_.\r\n               57, line 11, for “keeled,” read, _heeled_.\r\n               57, line  8, for “of,” read, _and_.\r\n               65, line  9, for “momentous,” read _momentary_.\r\n              102, line  6, for “Mather,” read _Matthew_.\r\n              107, line  9, after “ourselves,” insert _it_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Nantucket, in the State of Massachusetts, contains about\r\neight thousand inhabitants; nearly a third part of the population are\r\nquakers, and they are, taken together, a very industrious and\r\nenterprising people. On this island are owned about one hundred vessels,\r\nof all descriptions, engaged in the whale trade, giving constant\r\nemployment and support to upwards of sixteen hundred hardy seamen, a\r\nclass of people proverbial for their intrepidity. This fishery is not\r\ncarried on to any extent from any other part of the United States,\r\nexcept from the town of New-Bedford, directly opposite to Nantucket,\r\nwhere are owned probably twenty sail. A voyage generally lasts about two\r\nyears and a half, and with an entire uncertainty of success. Sometimes\r\nthey are repaid with speedy voyages and profitable cargoes, and at\r\nothers they drag out a listless and disheartening cruise, without\r\nscarcely making the expenses of an outfit. The business is considered a\r\nvery hazardous one, arising from unavoidable accidents, in carrying on\r\nan exterminating warfare against those great leviathans of the deep; and\r\nindeed a Nantucket man is on all occasions fully sensible of the honour\r\nand merit of his profession; no doubt because he knows that his laurels,\r\nlike the soldier’s, are plucked from the brink of danger. Numerous\r\nanecdotes are related of the whalemen of Nantucket; and stories of\r\nhair-breadth ’scapes, and sudden and wonderful preservation, are handed\r\ndown amongst them, with the fidelity, and no doubt many of them with the\r\ncharacteristic fictions of the ancient legendary tales. A spirit of\r\nadventure amongst the sons of other relatives of those immediately\r\nconcerned in it, takes possession of their minds at a very early age;\r\ncaptivated with the tough stories of the elder seamen, and seduced, as\r\nwell by the natural desire of seeing foreign countries, as by the hopes\r\nof gain, they launch forth six or eight thousand miles from home, into\r\nan almost untraversed ocean, and spend from two to three years of their\r\nlives in scenes of constant peril, labour, and watchfulness. The\r\nprofession is one of great ambition, and full of honourable excitement:\r\na tame man is never known amongst them; and the coward is marked with\r\nthat peculiar aversion, that distinguishes our public naval service.\r\nThere are perhaps no people of superior corporeal powers; and it has\r\nbeen truly said of them, that they possess a natural aptitude, which\r\nseems rather the lineal spirit of their fathers, than the effects of any\r\nexperience. The town itself, during the war, was (naturally to have been\r\nexpected,) on the decline; but with the return of peace it took a fresh\r\nstart, and a spirit for carrying on the fishery received a renewed and\r\nvery considerable excitement. Large capitals are now embarked; and some\r\nof the finest ships that our country can boast of are employed in it.\r\nThe increased demand, within a few years past, from the spermaceti\r\nmanufactories, has induced companies and individuals in different parts\r\nof the Union to become engaged in the business; and if the future\r\nconsumption of the manufactured article bear any proportion to that of\r\nthe few past years, this species of commerce will bid fair to become the\r\nmost profitable and extensive that our country possesses. From the\r\naccounts of those who were in the early stages of the fishery concerned\r\nin it, it would appear, that the whales have been driven, like the\r\nbeasts of the forest, before the march of civilization, into remote and\r\nmore unfrequented seas, until now, they are followed by the enterprise\r\nand perseverance of our seamen, even to the distant coasts of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe ship Essex, commanded by captain George Pollard, junior, was fitted\r\nout at Nantucket, and sailed on the 12th day of August, 1819, for the\r\nPacific Ocean, on a whaling voyage. Of this ship I was first mate. She\r\nhad lately undergone a thorough repair in her upper works, and was at\r\nthat time, in all respects, a sound, substantial vessel: she had a crew\r\nof twenty-one men, and was victualled and provided for two years and a\r\nhalf. We left the coast of America with a fine breeze, and steered for\r\nthe Western Islands. On the second day out, while sailing moderately on\r\nour course in the Gulf Stream, a sudden squall of wind struck the ship\r\nfrom the SW. and knocked her completely on her beam-ends, stove one of\r\nour boats, entirely destroyed two others, and threw down the cambouse.\r\nWe distinctly saw the approach of this gust, but miscalculated\r\naltogether as to the strength and violence of it. It struck the ship\r\nabout three points off the weather quarter, at the moment that the man\r\nat the helm was in the act of putting her away to run before it. In an\r\ninstant she was knocked down with her yards in the water; and before\r\nhardly a moment of time was allowed for reflection, she gradually came\r\nto the wind, and righted. The squall was accompanied with vivid flashes\r\nof lightning, and heavy and repeated claps of thunder. The whole ship’s\r\ncrew were, for a short time, thrown into the utmost consternation and\r\nconfusion; but fortunately the violence of the squall was all contained\r\nin the first gust of the wind, and it soon gradually abated, and became\r\nfine weather again. We repaired our damage with little difficulty, and\r\ncontinued on our course, with the loss of the two boats. On the 30th of\r\nAugust we made the island of Floros, one of the western group called the\r\nAzores. We lay off and on the island for two days, during which time our\r\nboats landed and obtained a supply of vegetables and a few hogs: from\r\nthis place we took the NE. trade-wind, and in sixteen days made the Isle\r\nof May, one of the Cape de Verds. As we were sailing along the shore of\r\nthis island, we discovered a ship stranded on the beach, and from her\r\nappearance took her to be a whaler. Having lost two of our boats, and\r\npresuming that this vessel had probably some belonging to her that might\r\nhave been saved, we determined to ascertain the name of the ship, and\r\nendeavour to supply if possible the loss of our boats from her. We\r\naccordingly stood in towards the port, or landing place. After a short\r\ntime three men were discovered coming out to us in a whale boat. In a\r\nfew moments they were alongside, and informed us that the wreck was the\r\nArchimedes of New-York, captain George B. Coffin, which vessel had\r\nstruck on a rock near the island about a fortnight previously; that all\r\nhands were saved by running the ship on shore, and that the captain and\r\ncrew had gone home. We purchased the whale boat of these people,\r\nobtained some few more pigs, and again set sail. Our passage thence to\r\nCape Horn was not distinguished for any incident worthy of note. We made\r\nthe longitude of the Cape about the 18th of December, having experienced\r\nhead winds for nearly the whole distance. We anticipated a moderate time\r\nin passing this noted land, from the season of the year at which we were\r\nthere, being considered the most favourable; but instead of this, we\r\nexperienced heavy westerly gales, and a most tremendous sea, that\r\ndetained us off the Cape five weeks, before we had got sufficiently to\r\nthe westward to enable us to put away. Of the passage of this famous\r\nCape it may be observed, that strong westerly gales and a heavy sea are\r\nits almost universal attendants: the prevalence and constancy of this\r\nwind and sea necessarily produce a rapid current, by which vessels are\r\nset to leeward; and it is not without some favourable slant of wind that\r\nthey can in many cases get round at all. The difficulties and dangers of\r\nthe passage are proverbial; but as far as my own observation extends,\r\n(and which the numerous reports of the whalemen corroborate,) you can\r\nalways rely upon a long and regular sea; and although the gales may be\r\nvery strong and stubborn, as they undoubtedly are, they are not known to\r\nblow with the destructive violence that characterizes some of the\r\ntornadoes of the western Atlantic Ocean. On the 17th of January, 1820,\r\nwe arrived at the island of St. Mary’s, lying on the coast of Chili, in\r\nlatitude 36° 59′ S. longitude 73° 41′ W. This island is a sort of\r\nrendezvous for whalers, from which they obtain their wood and water, and\r\nbetween which and the main land (a distance of about ten miles) they\r\nfrequently cruise for a species of whale called the right whale. Our\r\nobject in going in there was merely to get the news. We sailed thence to\r\nthe island of Massafuera, where we got some wood and fish, and thence\r\nfor the cruising ground along the coast of Chili, in search of the\r\nspermaceti-whale. We took there eight, which yielded us two hundred and\r\nfifty barrels of oil; and the season having by this time expired, we\r\nchanged our cruising ground to the coast of Peru. We obtained there five\r\nhundred and fifty barrels. After going into the small port of Decamas,\r\nand replenishing our wood and water, on the 2d October we set sail for\r\nthe Gallipagos Islands. We came to anchor, and laid seven days off\r\nHood’s Island, one of the group; during which time we stopped a leak\r\nwhich we had discovered, and obtained three hundred turtle. We then\r\nvisited Charles Island, where we procured sixty more. These turtle are a\r\nmost delicious food, and average in weight generally about one hundred\r\npounds, but many of them weigh upwards of eight hundred. With these,\r\nships usually supply themselves for a great length of time, and make a\r\ngreat saving of other provisions. They neither eat nor drink, nor is the\r\nleast pains taken with them; they are strewed over the deck, thrown\r\nunder foot, or packed away in the hold, as it suits convenience. They\r\nwill live upwards of a year without food or water, but soon die in a\r\ncold climate. We left Charles Island on the 23d of October, and steered\r\noff to the westward, in search of whales. In latitude 1° 0′ S. longitude\r\n118° W. on the 16th of November, in the afternoon, we lost a boat during\r\nour work in a shoal of whales. I was in the boat myself, with five\r\nothers, and was standing in the fore part, with the harpoon in my hand,\r\nwell braced, expecting every instant to catch sight of one of the shoal\r\nwhich we were in, that I might strike; but judge of my astonishment and\r\ndismay, at finding myself suddenly thrown up in the air, my companions\r\nscattered about me, and the boat fast filling with water. A whale had\r\ncome up directly under her, and with one dash of his tail, had stove her\r\nbottom in, and strewed us in every direction around her. We, however,\r\nwith little difficulty, got safely on the wreck, and clung there until\r\none of the other boats which had been engaged in the shoal, came to our\r\nassistance, and took us off. Strange to tell, not a man was injured by\r\nthis accident. Thus it happens very frequently in the whaling business,\r\nthat boats are stove; oars, harpoons, and lines broken; ancles and\r\nwrists sprained; boats upset, and whole crews left for hours in the\r\nwater, without any of these accidents extending to the loss of life. We\r\nare so much accustomed to the continual recurrence of such scenes as\r\nthese, that we become familiarized to them, and consequently always feel\r\nthat confidence and self-possession, which teaches us every expedient in\r\ndanger, and inures the body, as well as the mind, to fatigue, privation,\r\nand peril, in frequent cases exceeding belief. It is this danger and\r\nhardship that makes the sailor; indeed it is the distinguishing\r\nqualification amongst us; and it is a common boast of the whaleman, that\r\nhe has escaped from sudden and apparently inevitable destruction oftener\r\nthan his fellow. He is accordingly valued on this account, without much\r\nreference to other qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not been able to recur to the scenes which are now to become the\r\nsubject of description, although a considerable time has elapsed,\r\nwithout feeling a mingled emotion of horror and astonishment at the\r\nalmost incredible destiny that has preserved me and my surviving\r\ncompanions from a terrible death. Frequently, in my reflections on the\r\nsubject, even after this lapse of time, I find myself shedding tears of\r\ngratitude for our deliverance, and blessing God, by whose divine aid and\r\nprotection we were conducted through a series of unparalleled suffering\r\nand distress, and restored to the bosoms of our families and friends.\r\nThere is no knowing what a stretch of pain and misery the human mind is\r\ncapable of contemplating, when it is wrought upon by the anxieties of\r\npreservation; nor what pangs and weaknesses the body is able to endure,\r\nuntil they are visited upon it; and when at last deliverance comes, when\r\nthe dream of hope is realized, unspeakable gratitude takes possession of\r\nthe soul, and tears of joy choke the utterance. We require to be taught\r\nin the school of some signal suffering, privation, and despair, the\r\ngreat lessons of constant dependence upon an almighty forbearance and\r\nmercy. In the midst of the wide ocean, at night, when the sight of the\r\nheavens was shut out, and the dark tempest came upon us; then it was,\r\nthat we felt ourselves ready to exclaim, “Heaven have mercy upon us, for\r\nnought but that can save us now.” But I proceed to the recital.—On the\r\n20th of November, (cruising in latitude 0° 40′ S. longitude 119° 0′ W.)\r\na shoal of whales was discovered off the lee-bow. The weather at this\r\ntime was extremely fine and clear, and it was about 8 o’clock in the\r\nmorning, that the man at the mast-head gave the usual cry of, “there she\r\nblows.” The ship was immediately put away, and we ran down in the\r\ndirection for them. When we had got within half a mile of the place\r\nwhere they were observed, all our boats were lowered down, manned, and\r\nwe started in pursuit of them. The ship, in the mean time, was brought\r\nto the wind, and the main-top-sail hove aback, to wait for us. I had the\r\nharpoon in the second boat; the captain preceded me in the first. When I\r\narrived at the spot where we calculated they were, nothing was at first\r\nto be seen. We lay on our oars in anxious expectation of discovering\r\nthem come up somewhere near us. Presently one rose, and spouted a short\r\ndistance ahead of my boat; I made all speed towards it, came up with,\r\nand struck it; feeling the harpoon in him, he threw himself, in an\r\nagony, over towards the boat, (which at that time was up alongside of\r\nhim,) and giving a severe blow with his tail, struck the boat near the\r\nedge of the water, amidships, and stove a hole in her. I immediately\r\ntook up the boat hatchet, and cut the line, to disengage the boat from\r\nthe whale, which by this time was running off with great velocity. I\r\nsucceeded in getting clear of him, with the loss of the harpoon and\r\nline; and finding the water to pour fast in the boat, I hastily stuffed\r\nthree or four of our jackets in the hole, ordered one man to keep\r\nconstantly bailing, and the rest to pull immediately for the ship; we\r\nsucceeded in keeping the boat free, and shortly gained the ship. The\r\ncaptain and the second mate, in the other two boats, kept up the\r\npursuit, and soon struck another whale. They being at this time a\r\nconsiderable distance to leeward, I went forward, braced around the\r\nmainyard, and put the ship off in a direction for them; the boat which\r\nhad been stove was immediately hoisted in, and after examining the hole,\r\nI found that I could, by nailing a piece of canvass over it, get her\r\nready to join in a fresh pursuit, sooner than by lowering down the other\r\nremaining boat which belonged to the ship. I accordingly turned her over\r\nupon the quarter, and was in the act of nailing on the canvass, when I\r\nobserved a very large spermaceti whale, as well as I could judge, about\r\neighty-five feet in length; he broke water about twenty rods off our\r\nweather-bow, and was lying quietly, with his head in a direction for the\r\nship. He spouted two or three times, and then disappeared. In less than\r\ntwo or three seconds he came up again, about the length of the ship off,\r\nand made directly for us, at the rate of about three knots. The ship was\r\nthen going with about the same velocity. His appearance and attitude\r\ngave us at first no alarm; but while I stood watching his movements, and\r\nobserving him but a ship’s length off, coming down for us with great\r\ncelerity, I involuntarily ordered the boy at the helm to put it hard up;\r\nintending to sheer off and avoid him. The words were scarcely out of my\r\nmouth, before he came down upon us with full speed, and struck the ship\r\nwith his head, just forward of the fore-chains; he gave us such an\r\nappalling and tremendous jar, as nearly threw us all on our faces. The\r\nship brought up as suddenly and violently as if she had struck a rock,\r\nand trembled for a few seconds like a leaf. We looked at each other with\r\nperfect amazement, deprived almost of the power of speech. Many minutes\r\nelapsed before we were able to realize the dreadful accident; during\r\nwhich time he passed under the ship, grazing her keel as he went along,\r\ncame up alongside of her to leeward, and lay on the top of the water,\r\n(apparently stunned with the violence of the blow,) for the space of a\r\nminute; he then suddenly started off, in a direction to leeward. After a\r\nfew moments’ reflection, and recovering, in some measure, from the\r\nsudden consternation that had seized us, I of course concluded that he\r\nhad stove a hole in the ship, and that it would be necessary to set the\r\npumps going. Accordingly they were rigged, but had not been in operation\r\nmore than one minute, before I perceived the head of the ship to be\r\ngradually settling down in the water; I then ordered the signal to be\r\nset for the other boats, which, scarcely had I dispatched, before I\r\nagain discovered the whale, apparently in convulsions, on the top of the\r\nwater, about one hundred rods to leeward. He was enveloped in the foam\r\nof the sea, that his continual and violent thrashing about in the water\r\nhad created around him, and I could distinctly see him smite his jaws\r\ntogether, as if distracted with rage and fury. He remained a short time\r\nin this situation, and then started off with great velocity, across the\r\nbows of the ship, to windward. By this time the ship had settled down a\r\nconsiderable distance in the water, and I gave her up as lost. I\r\nhowever, ordered the pumps to be kept constantly going, and endeavoured\r\nto collect my thoughts for the occasion. I turned to the boats, two of\r\nwhich we then had with the ship, with an intention of clearing them\r\naway, and getting all things ready to embark in them, if there should be\r\nno other resource left; and while my attention was thus engaged for a\r\nmoment, I was aroused with the cry of a man at the hatchway, “here he\r\nis—he is making for us again.” I turned around, and saw him about one\r\nhundred rods directly ahead of us, coming down apparently with twice his\r\nordinary speed, and to me at that moment, it appeared with tenfold fury\r\nand vengeance in his aspect. The surf flew in all directions about him,\r\nand his course towards us was marked by a white foam of a rod in width,\r\nwhich he made with the continual violent thrashing of his tail; his head\r\nwas about half out of water, and in that way he came upon, and again\r\nstruck the ship. I was in hopes when I descried him making for us, that\r\nby a dexterous movement of putting the ship away immediately, I should\r\nbe able to cross the line of his approach, before he could get up to us,\r\nand thus avoid, what I knew, if he should strike us again, would prove\r\nour inevitable destruction. I bawled out to the helmsman, “hard up!” but\r\nshe had not fallen off more than a point, before we took the second\r\nshock. I should judge the speed of the ship to have been at this time\r\nabout three knots, and that of the whale about six. He struck her to\r\nwindward, directly under the cathead, and completely stove in her bows.\r\nHe passed under the ship again, went off to leeward, and we saw no more\r\nof him. Our situation at this juncture can be more readily imagined than\r\ndescribed. The shock to our feelings was such, as I am sure none can\r\nhave an adequate conception of, that were not there: the misfortune\r\nbefel us at a moment when we least dreamt of any accident; and from the\r\npleasing anticipations we had formed, of realizing the certain profits\r\nof our labour, we were dejected by a sudden, most mysterious, and\r\noverwhelming calamity. Not a moment, however, was to be lost in\r\nendeavouring to provide for the extremity to which it was now certain we\r\nwere reduced. We were more than a thousand miles from the nearest land,\r\nand with nothing but a light open boat, as the resource of safety for\r\nmyself and companions. I ordered the men to cease pumping, and every one\r\nto provide for himself; seizing a hatchet at the same time, I cut away\r\nthe lashings of the spare boat, which lay bottom up, across two spars\r\ndirectly over the quarter deck, and cried out to those near me, to take\r\nher as she came down. They did so accordingly, and bore her on their\r\nshoulders as far as the waist of the ship. The steward had in the mean\r\ntime gone down into the cabin twice, and saved two quadrants, two\r\npractical navigators, and the captain’s trunk and mine; all which were\r\nhastily thrown into the boat, as she lay on the deck, with the two\r\ncompasses which I snatched from the binnacle. He attempted to descend\r\nagain; but the water by this time had rushed in, and he returned without\r\nbeing able to effect his purpose. By the time we had got the boat to the\r\nwaist, the ship had filled with water, and was going down on her\r\nbeam-ends: we shoved our boat as quickly as possible from the\r\nplank-shear into the water, all hands jumping in her at the same time,\r\nand launched off clear of the ship. We were scarcely two boat’s lengths\r\ndistant from her, when she fell over to windward, and settled down in\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nAmazement and despair now wholly took possession of us. We contemplated\r\nthe frightful situation the ship lay in, and thought with horror upon\r\nthe sudden and dreadful calamity that had overtaken us. We looked upon\r\neach other, as if to gather some consolatory sensation from an\r\ninterchange of sentiments, but every countenance was marked with the\r\npaleness of despair. Not a word was spoken for several minutes by any of\r\nus; all appeared to be bound in a spell of stupid consternation; and\r\nfrom the time we were first attacked by the whale, to the period of the\r\nfall of the ship, and of our leaving her in the boat, more than ten\r\nminutes could not certainly have elapsed! God only knows in what way, or\r\nby what means, we were enabled to accomplish in that short time what we\r\ndid; the cutting away and transporting the boat from where she was\r\ndeposited would of itself, in ordinary circumstances, have consumed as\r\nmuch time as that, if the whole ship’s crew had been employed in it. My\r\ncompanions had not saved a single article but what they had on their\r\nbacks; but to me it was a source of infinite satisfaction, if any such\r\ncould be gathered from the horrors of our gloomy situation, that we had\r\nbeen fortunate enough to have preserved our compasses, navigators, and\r\nquadrants. After the first shock of my feelings was over, I\r\nenthusiastically contemplated them as the probable instruments of our\r\nsalvation; without them all would have been dark and hopeless. Gracious\r\nGod! what a picture of distress and suffering now presented itself to my\r\nimagination. The crew of the ship were saved, consisting of twenty human\r\nsouls. All that remained to conduct these twenty beings through the\r\nstormy terrors of the ocean, perhaps many thousand miles, were three\r\nopen light boats. The prospect of obtaining any provisions or water from\r\nthe ship, to subsist upon during the time, was at least now doubtful.\r\nHow many long and watchful nights, thought I, are to be passed? How many\r\ntedious days of partial starvation are to be endured, before the least\r\nrelief or mitigation of our sufferings can be reasonably anticipated? We\r\nlay at this time in our boat, about two ship’s lengths off from the\r\nwreck, in perfect silence, calmly contemplating her situation, and\r\nabsorbed in our own melancholy reflections, when the other boats were\r\ndiscovered rowing up to us. They had but shortly before discovered that\r\nsome accident had befallen us, but of the nature of which they were\r\nentirely ignorant. The sudden and mysterious disappearance of the ship\r\nwas first discovered by the boat-steerer in the captain’s boat, and with\r\na horror-struck countenance and voice, he suddenly exclaimed, “Oh, my\r\nGod! where is the ship?” Their operations upon this were instantly\r\nsuspended, and a general cry of horror and despair burst from the lips\r\nof every man, as their looks were directed for her, in vain, over every\r\npart of the ocean. They immediately made all haste towards us. The\r\ncaptain’s boat was the first that reached us. He stopped about a boat’s\r\nlength off, but had no power to utter a single syllable: he was so\r\ncompletely overpowered with the spectacle before him, that he sat down\r\nin his boat, pale and speechless. I could scarcely recognise his\r\ncountenance, he appeared to be so much altered, awed, and overcome, with\r\nthe oppression of his feelings, and the dreadful reality that lay before\r\nhim. He was in a short time however enabled to address the inquiry to\r\nme, “My God, Mr. Chase, what is the matter?” I answered, “We have been\r\nstove by a whale.” I then briefly told him the story. After a few\r\nmoment’s reflection he observed, that we must cut away her masts, and\r\nendeavour to get something out of her to eat. Our thoughts were now all\r\naccordingly bent on endeavours to save from the wreck whatever we might\r\npossibly want, and for this purpose we rowed up and got on to her.\r\nSearch was made for every means of gaining access to her hold; and for\r\nthis purpose the lanyards were cut loose, and with our hatchets we\r\ncommenced to cut away the masts, that she might right up again, and\r\nenable us to scuttle her decks. In doing which we were occupied about\r\nthree quarters of an hour, owing to our having no axes, nor indeed any\r\nother instruments, but the small hatchets belonging to the boats. After\r\nher masts were gone she came up about two-thirds of the way upon an even\r\nkeel. While we were employed about the masts the captain took his\r\nquadrant, shoved off from the ship, and got an observation. We found\r\nourselves in latitude 0° 40′ S. longitude 119° W. We now commenced to\r\ncut a hole through the planks, directly above two large casks of bread,\r\nwhich most fortunately were between decks, in the waist of the ship, and\r\nwhich being in the upper side, when she upset, we had strong hopes was\r\nnot wet. It turned out according to our wishes, and from these casks we\r\nobtained six hundred pounds of hard bread. Other parts of the deck were\r\nthen scuttled, and we got without difficulty as much fresh water as we\r\ndared to take in the boats, so that each was supplied with about\r\nsixty-five gallons; we got also from one of the lockers a musket, a\r\nsmall canister of powder, a couple of files, two rasps, about two pounds\r\nof boat nails, and a few turtle. In the afternoon the wind came on to\r\nblow a strong breeze; and having obtained every thing that occurred to\r\nus could then be got out, we began to make arrangements for our safety\r\nduring the night. A boat’s line was made fast to the ship, and to the\r\nother end of it one of the boats was moored, at about fifty fathoms to\r\nleeward; another boat was then attached to the first one, about eight\r\nfathoms astern; and the third boat, the like distance astern of her.\r\nNight came on just as we had finished our operations; and such a night\r\nas it was to us! so full of feverish and distracting inquietude, that we\r\nwere deprived entirely of rest. The wreck was constantly before my eyes.\r\nI could not, by any effort, chase away the horrors of the preceding day\r\nfrom my mind: they haunted me the live-long night. My companions—some of\r\nthem were like sick women; they had no idea of the extent of their\r\ndeplorable situation. One or two slept unconcernedly, while others\r\nwasted the night in unavailing murmurs. I now had full leisure to\r\nexamine, with some degree of coolness, the dreadful circumstances of our\r\ndisaster. The scenes of yesterday passed in such quick succession in my\r\nmind that it was not until after many hours of severe reflection that I\r\nwas able to discard the idea of the catastrophe as a dream. Alas! it was\r\none from which there was no awaking; it was too certainly true, that but\r\nyesterday we had existed as it were, and in one short moment had been\r\ncut off from all the hopes and prospects of the living! I have no\r\nlanguage to paint out the horrors of our situation. To shed tears was\r\nindeed altogether unavailing, and withal unmanly; yet I was not able to\r\ndeny myself the relief they served to afford me. After several hours of\r\nidle sorrow and repining I began to reflect upon the accident, and\r\nendeavoured to realize by what unaccountable destiny or design, (which I\r\ncould not at first determine,) this sudden and most deadly attack had\r\nbeen made upon us: by an animal, too, never before suspected of\r\npremeditated violence, and proverbial for its insensibility and\r\ninoffensiveness. Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it\r\nwas any thing but chance which directed his operations; he made two\r\nseveral attacks upon the ship, at a short interval between them, both of\r\nwhich, according to their direction, were calculated to do us the most\r\ninjury, by being made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two\r\nobjects for the shock; to effect which, the exact manœuvres which he\r\nmade were necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\r\nresentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just\r\nbefore entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as\r\nif fired with revenge for their sufferings. But to this it may be\r\nobserved, that the mode of fighting which they always adopt is either\r\nwith repeated strokes of their tails, or snapping of their jaws\r\ntogether; and that a case, precisely similar to this one, has never been\r\nheard of amongst the oldest and most experienced whalers. To this I\r\nwould answer, that the structure and strength of the whale’s head is\r\nadmirably designed for this mode of attack; the most prominent part of\r\nwhich is almost as hard and as tough as iron; indeed, I can compare it\r\nto nothing else but the inside of a horse’s hoof, upon which a lance or\r\nharpoon would not make the slightest impression. The eyes and ears are\r\nremoved nearly one-third the length of the whole fish, from the front\r\npart of the head, and are not in the least degree endangered in this\r\nmode of attack. At all events, the whole circumstances taken together,\r\nall happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time,\r\nimpressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of\r\nthe whale, (many of which impressions I cannot now recall,) induce me to\r\nbe satisfied that I am correct in my opinion. It is certainly, in all\r\nits bearings, a hitherto unheard of circumstance, and constitutes,\r\nperhaps, the most extraordinary one in the annals of the fishery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember 21st. The morning dawned upon our wretched company. The weather\r\nwas fine, but the wind blew a strong breeze from the SE. and the sea was\r\nvery rugged. Watches had been kept up during the night, in our\r\nrespective boats, to see that none of the spars or other articles (which\r\ncontinued to float out of the wreck,) should be thrown by the surf\r\nagainst, and injure the boats. At sunrise, we began to think of doing\r\nsomething; what, we did not know: we cast loose our boats, and visited\r\nthe wreck, to see if any thing more of consequence could be preserved,\r\nbut every thing looked cheerless and desolate, and we made a long and\r\nvain search for any useful article; nothing could be found but a few\r\nturtle; of these we had enough already; or at least, as many as could be\r\nsafely stowed in the boats, and we wandered around in every part of the\r\nship in a sort of vacant idleness for the greater part of the morning.\r\nWe were presently aroused to a perfect sense of our destitute and\r\nforlorn condition; by thoughts of the means which we had for our\r\nsubsistence, the necessity of not wasting our time, and of endeavouring\r\nto seek some relief wherever God might direct us. Our thoughts, indeed,\r\nhung about the ship, wrecked and sunken as she was, and we could\r\nscarcely discard from our minds the idea of her continuing protection.\r\nSome great efforts in our situation were necessary, and a great deal of\r\ncalculation important, as it concerned the means by which our existence\r\nwas to be supported during, perhaps, a very long period, and a provision\r\nfor our eventual deliverance. Accordingly, by agreement, all set to work\r\nin stripping off the light sails of the ship, for sails to our boats;\r\nand the day was consumed in making them up and fitting them. We\r\nfurnished ourselves with masts and other light spars that were\r\nnecessary, from the wreck. Each boat was rigged with two masts, to carry\r\na flying-jib and two sprit-sails; the sprit-sails were made so that two\r\nreefs could be taken in them, in case of heavy blows. We continued to\r\nwatch the wreck for any serviceable articles that might float from her,\r\nand kept one man during the day, on the stump of her foremast, on the\r\nlook out for vessels. Our work was very much impeded by the increase of\r\nthe wind and sea, and the surf breaking almost continually into the\r\nboats, gave us many fears that we should not be able to prevent our\r\nprovisions from getting wet; and above all served to increase the\r\nconstant apprehensions that we had, of the insufficiency of the boats\r\nthemselves, during the rough weather that we should necessarily\r\nexperience. In order to provide as much as possible against this, and\r\nwithal to strengthen the slight materials of which the boats were\r\nconstructed, we procured from the wreck some light cedar boards,\r\n(intended to repair boats in cases of accidents,) with which we built up\r\nadditional sides, about six inches above the gunwale; these, we\r\nafterwards found, were of infinite service for the purpose for which\r\nthey were intended; in truth, I am satisfied we could never have been\r\npreserved without them; the boats must otherwise have taken in so much\r\nwater that all the efforts of twenty such weak, starving men as we\r\nafterwards came to be, would not have sufficed to keep her free; but\r\nwhat appeared most immediately to concern us, and to command all our\r\nanxieties, was the security of our provisions from the salt water. We\r\ndisposed of them under a covering of wood, that whale boats have at\r\neither end of them, wrapping it up in several thicknesses of canvass. I\r\ngot an observation to-day, by which I found we were in latitude 0° 6′ S.\r\nlongitude 119° 30′ W. having been driven by the winds a distance of\r\nforty-nine miles the last twenty-four hours; by this it would appear\r\nthat there must have been a strong current, setting us to the NW. during\r\nthe whole time. We were not able to finish our sails in one day; and\r\nmany little things preparatory to taking a final leave of the ship were\r\nnecessary to be attended to, but evening came and put an end to our\r\nlabours. We made the same arrangements for mooring the boats in safety,\r\nand consigned ourselves to the horrors of another tempestuous night. The\r\nwind continued to blow hard, keeping up a heavy sea, and veering around\r\nfrom SE. to E. and E.SE. As the gloom of night approached, and obliged\r\nus to desist from that employment, which cheated us out of some of the\r\nrealities of our situation, we all of us again became mute and\r\ndesponding: a considerable degree of alacrity had been manifested by\r\nmany the preceding day, as their attention had been wholly engaged in\r\nscrutinizing the wreck, and in constructing the sails and spars for the\r\nboats; but when they ceased to be occupied, they passed to a sudden fit\r\nof melancholy, and the miseries of their situation came upon them with\r\nsuch force, as to produce spells of extreme debility, approaching almost\r\nto fainting. Our provisions were scarcely touched—the appetite was\r\nentirely gone: but as we had a great abundance of water, we indulged in\r\nfrequent and copious draughts, which our parched mouths seemed\r\ncontinually to need. None asked for bread. Our continued state of\r\nanxiety during the night, excluded all hopes of sleep; still, (although\r\nthe solemn fact had been before me for nearly two days,) my mind\r\nmanifested the utmost repugnance to be reconciled to it; I laid down in\r\nthe bottom of the boat, and resigned myself to reflection; my silent\r\nprayers were offered up to the God of mercy, for that protection which\r\nwe stood so much in need of. Sometimes, indeed, a light hope would dawn,\r\nbut then, to feel such an utter dependence on and consignment to chance\r\nalone for aid and rescue, would chase it again from my mind. The\r\nwreck—the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal—the sudden\r\nprostration and sinking of the vessel—our escape from her, and our then\r\nforlorn and almost hapless destiny, all passed in quick and perplexing\r\nreview in my imagination; wearied with the exertion of the body and\r\nmind, I caught, near morning, an hour’s respite from my troubles, in\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nNovember 22d. The wind remained the same, and the weather continued\r\nremarkably fine. At sunrise, we again hauled our boats up, and continued\r\nour search for articles that might float out. About 7 o’clock, the deck\r\nof the wreck began to give way, and every appearance indicated her\r\nspeedy dissolution; the oil had bilged in the hold, and kept the surface\r\nof the sea all around us completely covered with it; the bulk-heads were\r\nall washed down, and she worked in every part of her joints and seams,\r\nwith the violent and continual breaking of the surf over her. Seeing, at\r\nlast, that little or nothing further could be done by remaining with the\r\nwreck, and as it was all important that while our provisions lasted, we\r\nshould make the best possible use of time, I rowed up to the captain’s\r\nboat, and asked him what he intended to do. I informed him that the\r\nship’s decks had bursted up, and that in all probability she would soon\r\ngo to pieces; that no further purpose could be answered, by remaining\r\nlonger with her, since nothing more could be obtained from her; and that\r\nit was my opinion, no time should be lost in making the best of our way\r\ntowards the nearest land. The captain observed, that he would go once\r\nmore to the wreck, and survey her, and after waiting until 12 o’clock\r\nfor the purpose of getting an observation, would immediately after\r\ndetermine. In the mean time, before noon all our sails were completed,\r\nand the boats otherwise got in readiness for our departure. Our\r\nobservation now proved us to be in latitude 0° 13′ N. longitude 120° 00′\r\nW. as near as we could determine it, having crossed the equator during\r\nthe night, and drifted nineteen miles. The wind had veered considerably\r\nto the eastward, during the last twenty-four hours. Our nautical\r\ncalculations having been completed, the captain, after visiting the\r\nwreck, called a council, consisting of himself and the first and second\r\nmates, who all repaired to his boat, to interchange opinions, and devise\r\nthe best means for our security and preservation. There were, in all of\r\nus, twenty men; six of whom were blacks, and we had three boats. We\r\nexamined our navigators, to ascertain the nearest land, and found it was\r\nthe Marquesas Islands. The Society Islands were next; these islands we\r\nwere entirely ignorant of; if inhabited, we presumed they were by\r\nsavages, from whom we had as much to fear, as from the elements, or even\r\ndeath itself. We had no charts from which our calculations might be\r\naided, and were consequently obliged to govern ourselves by the\r\nnavigators alone; it was also the captain’s opinion, that this was the\r\nseason of the hurricanes which prevail in the vicinity of the Sandwich\r\nIslands, and that consequently it would be unsafe to steer for them. The\r\nissue of our deliberations was, that, taking all things into\r\nconsideration, it would be most adviseable to shape our course by the\r\nwind, to the southward, as far as 25° or 26° S. latitude, fall in with\r\nthe variable winds, and then, endeavour to get eastward to the coast of\r\nChili or Peru. Accordingly, preparations were made for our immediate\r\ndeparture; the boat which it was my fortune, or rather misfortune to\r\nhave, was the worst of the three; she was old and patched up, having\r\nbeen stove a number of times, during the cruise. At best, a whale boat\r\nis an extremely frail thing; the most so of any other kind of boat; they\r\nare what is called clinker built, and constructed of the lightest\r\nmaterials, for the purpose of being rowed with the greatest possible\r\ncelerity, according to the necessities of the business for which they\r\nare intended. Of all species of vessels, they are the weakest, and most\r\nfragile, and possess but one advantage over any other—that of lightness\r\nand buoyancy, that enables them to keep above the dash of the sea, with\r\nmore facility than heavier ones. This qualification is, however,\r\npreferable to that of any other, and, situated as we then were, I would\r\nnot have exchanged her, old and crazy as she was, for even a ship’s\r\nlaunch. I am quite confident, that to this quality of our boats we most\r\nespecially owed our preservation, through the many days and nights of\r\nheavy weather, that we afterwards encountered. In consideration of my\r\nhaving the weakest boat, six men were allotted to it; while those of the\r\ncaptain and second mate, took seven each, and at half past 12 we left\r\nthe wreck, steering our course, with nearly all sail set, S.SE. At four\r\no’clock in the afternoon we lost sight of her entirely. Many were the\r\nlingering and sorrowful looks we cast behind us.\r\n\r\nIt has appeared to me often since to have been, in the abstract, an\r\nextreme weakness and folly, on our parts, to have looked upon our\r\nshattered and sunken vessel with such an excessive fondness and regret;\r\nbut it seemed as if in abandoning her we had parted with all hope, and\r\nwere bending our course away from her, rather by some dictate of\r\ndespair. We agreed to keep together, in our boats, as nearly as\r\npossible, to afford assistance in cases of accident, and to render our\r\nreflections less melancholy by each other’s presence. I found it on this\r\noccasion true, that misery does indeed love company; unaided, and\r\nunencouraged by each other, there were with us many whose weak minds, I\r\nam confident, would have sunk under the dismal retrospections of the\r\npast catastrophe, and who did not possess either sense or firmness\r\nenough to contemplate our approaching destiny, without the cheering of\r\nsome more determined countenance than their own. The wind was strong all\r\nday; and the sea ran very high, our boat taking in water from her leaks\r\ncontinually, so that we were obliged to keep one man constantly bailing.\r\nDuring the night the weather became extremely rugged, and the sea every\r\nnow and then broke over us. By agreement, we were divided into two\r\nwatches; one of which was to be constantly awake, and doing the labours\r\nof the boat, such as bailing; setting, taking in, and trimming the\r\nsails. We kept our course very well together during this night, and had\r\nmany opportunities of conversation with the men in the other boats,\r\nwherein the means and prospects of our deliverance were variously\r\nconsidered; it appeared from the opinions of all, that we had most to\r\nhope for in the meeting with some vessel, and most probably some whale\r\nship, the great majority of whom, in those seas, we imagined were\r\ncruising about the latitude we were then steering for; but this was only\r\na hope, the realization of which did not in any degree depend on our own\r\nexertions, but on chance alone. It was not, therefore, considered\r\nprudent, by going out of our course, with the prospect of meeting them,\r\nto lose sight, for one moment, of the strong probabilities which, under\r\nDivine Providence, there were of our reaching land by the route we had\r\nprescribed to ourselves; as that depended, most especially, on a\r\nreasonable calculation, and on our own labours, we conceived that our\r\nprovision and water, on a small allowance, would last us sixty days;\r\nthat with the trade-wind, on the course we were then lying, we should be\r\nable to average the distance of a degree a day, which, in 26 days, would\r\nenable us to attain the region of the variable winds, and then, in\r\nthirty more, at the very utmost, should there be any favour in the\r\nelements, we might reach the coast. With these considerations we\r\ncommenced our voyage; the total failure of all which, and the subsequent\r\ndismal distress and suffering, by which we were overtaken, will be shown\r\nin the sequel. Our allowance of provision at first consisted of bread;\r\none biscuit, weighing about one pound three ounces, and half a pint of\r\nwater a day, for each man. This small quantity, (less than one third\r\nwhich is required by an ordinary person,) small as it was, we however\r\ntook without murmuring, and, on many an occasion afterwards, blest God\r\nthat even this pittance was allowed to us in our misery. The darkness of\r\nanother night overtook us; and after having for the first time partook\r\nof our allowance of bread and water, we laid our weary bodies down in\r\nthe boat, and endeavoured to get some repose. Nature became at last worn\r\nout with the watchings and anxieties of the two preceding nights, and\r\nsleep came insensibly upon us. No dreams could break the strong\r\nfastenings of forgetfulness in which the mind was then locked up; but\r\nfor my own part, my thoughts so haunted me that this luxury was yet a\r\nstranger to my eyes; every recollection was still fresh before me, and I\r\nenjoyed but a few short and unsatisfactory slumbers, caught in the\r\nintervals between my hopes and my fears. The dark ocean and swelling\r\nwaters were nothing; the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful\r\ntempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary\r\nsubjects of fearful contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a\r\nmoment’s thought; the dismal looking wreck, and the horrid aspect and\r\nrevenge of the whale, wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again\r\nmade its appearance.\r\n\r\nNovember 23d. In my chest, which I was fortunate enough to preserve, I\r\nhad several small articles, which we found of great service to us; among\r\nthe rest, some eight or ten sheets of writing paper, a lead pencil, a\r\nsuit of clothes, three small fish-hooks, a jack-knife, a whetstone, and\r\na cake of soap. I commenced to keep a sort of journal with the little\r\npaper and pencil which I had; and the knife, besides other useful\r\npurposes, served us as a razor. It was with much difficulty, however,\r\nthat I could keep any sort of record, owing to the incessant rocking and\r\nunsteadiness of the boat, and the continual dashing of the spray of the\r\nsea over us. The boat contained, in addition to the articles enumerated,\r\na lantern, tinder-box, and two or three candles, which belonged to her,\r\nand with which they are kept always supplied, while engaged in taking\r\nwhale. In addition to all which, the captain had saved a musket, two\r\npistols, and a canister, containing about two pounds of gunpowder; the\r\nlatter he distributed in equal proportions between the three boats, and\r\ngave the second mate and myself each a pistol. When morning came we\r\nfound ourselves quite near together, and the wind had considerably\r\nincreased since the day before; we were consequently obliged to reef our\r\nsails; and although we did not apprehend any very great danger from the\r\nthen violence of the wind, yet it grew to be very uncomfortable in the\r\nboats, from the repeated dashing of the waves, that kept our bodies\r\nconstantly wet with the salt spray. We, however, stood along our course\r\nuntil twelve o’clock, when we got an observation, as well as we were\r\nable to obtain one, while the water flew all over us, and the sea kept\r\nthe boat extremely unsteady. We found ourselves this day in latitude 0°\r\n58′ S. having repassed the equator. We abandoned the idea altogether of\r\nkeeping any correct longitudinal reckoning, having no glass, nor\r\nlog-line. The wind moderated in the course of the afternoon a little,\r\nbut at night came on to blow again almost a gale. We began now to\r\ntremble for our little barque; she was so ill calculated, in point of\r\nstrength, to withstand the racking of the sea, while it required the\r\nconstant labours of one man to keep her free of water. We were\r\nsurrounded in the afternoon with porpoises that kept playing about us in\r\ngreat numbers, and continued to follow us during the night.\r\n\r\nNovember 24th. The wind had not abated any since the preceding day, and\r\nthe sea had risen to be very large, and increased, if possible, the\r\nextreme uncomfortableness of our situation. What added more than any\r\nthing else to our misfortunes, was, that all our efforts for the\r\npreservation of our provisions proved, in a great measure, ineffectual;\r\na heavy sea broke suddenly into the boat, and, before we could snatch it\r\nup, damaged some part of it; by timely attention, however, and great\r\ncaution, we managed to make it eatable, and to preserve the rest from a\r\nsimilar casualty. This was a subject of extreme anxiety to us; the\r\nexpectation, poor enough of itself indeed, upon which our final rescue\r\nwas founded, must change at once to utter hopelessness, deprived of our\r\nprovisions, the only means of continuing us in the exercise, not only of\r\nour manual powers, but in those of reason itself; hence, above all other\r\nthings, this was the object of our utmost solicitude and pains.\r\n\r\nWe ascertained, the next day, that some of the provisions in the\r\ncaptain’s boat had shared a similar fate during the night; both which\r\naccidents served to arouse us to a still stronger sense of our slender\r\nreliance upon the human means at our command, and to show us our utter\r\ndependence on that divine aid which we so much the more stood in need\r\nof.\r\n\r\nNovember 25th. No change of wind had yet taken place, and we experienced\r\nthe last night the same wet and disagreeable weather of the preceding\r\none. About eight o’clock in the morning we discovered that the water\r\nbegan to come fast in our boat, and in a few minutes the quantity\r\nincreased to such a degree as to alarm us considerably for our safety;\r\nwe commenced immediately a strict search in every part of her to\r\ndiscover the leak, and, after tearing up the ceiling or floor of the\r\nboat near the bows, we found it proceeded from one of the streaks or\r\noutside boards having bursted off there; no time was to be lost in\r\ndevising some means to repair it. The great difficulty consisted in its\r\nbeing in the bottom of the boat, about six inches from the surface of\r\nthe water; it was necessary, therefore, to have access to the outside,\r\nto enable us to fasten it on again: the leak being to leeward, we hove\r\nabout, and lay to on the other tack, which brought it then nearly out of\r\nwater; the captain, who was at the time ahead of us, seeing us\r\nmanœuvring to get the boat about, shortened sail, and presently tacked,\r\nand ran down to us. I informed him of our situation, and he came\r\nimmediately alongside to our assistance. After directing all the men in\r\nthe boat to get on one side, the other, by that means, heeled out of the\r\nwater a considerable distance, and, with a little difficulty, we then\r\nmanaged to drive in a few nails, and secured it, much beyond our\r\nexpectations. Fears of no ordinary kind were excited by this seemingly\r\nsmall accident. When it is recollected to what a slight vessel we had\r\ncommitted ourselves; our means of safety alone consisting in her\r\ncapacity and endurance for many weeks, in all probability, yet to come,\r\nit will not be considered strange that this little accident should not\r\nonly have damped our spirits considerably, but have thrown a great\r\ngloominess over the natural prospects of our deliverance. On this\r\noccasion, too, were we enabled to rescue ourselves from inevitable\r\ndestruction by the possession of a few nails, without which, (had it not\r\nbeen our fortune to save some from the wreck,) we would, in all human\r\ncalculation, have been lost: we were still liable to a recurrence of the\r\nsame accident, perhaps to a still worse one, as, in the heavy and\r\nrepeated racking of the swell, the progress of our voyage would serve\r\nbut to increase the incapacity and weakness of our boat, and the\r\nstarting of a single nail in her bottom would most assuredly prove our\r\ncertain destruction. We wanted not this additional reflection, to add to\r\nthe miseries of our situation.\r\n\r\nNovember 26th. Our sufferings, heaven knows, were now sufficiently\r\nincreased, and we looked forward, not without an extreme dread, and\r\nanxiety, to the gloomy and disheartening prospect before us. We\r\nexperienced a little abatement of wind and rough weather to-day, and\r\ntook the opportunity of drying the bread that had been wet the day\r\npreviously; to our great joy and satisfaction also, the wind hauled out\r\nto E.NE. and enabled us to hold a much more favourable course; with\r\nthese exceptions, no circumstance of any considerable interest occurred\r\nin the course of this day.\r\n\r\nThe 27th of November was alike undistinguished for any incident worthy\r\nof note; except that the wind again veered back to E. and destroyed the\r\nfine prospect we had entertained, of making a good run for several days\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nNovember 28th. The wind hauled still further to the southward, and\r\nobliged us to fall off our course to S. and commenced to blow with such\r\nviolence, as to put us again under short sail; the night set in\r\nextremely dark, and tempestuous, and we began to entertain fears that we\r\nshould be separated. We however, with great pains, managed to keep about\r\na ship’s length apart, so that the white sails of our boats could be\r\ndistinctly discernable. The captain’s boat was but a short distance\r\nastern of mine, and that of the second mate a few rods to leeward of\r\nhis. At about 11 o’clock at night, having laid down to sleep, in the\r\nbottom of the boat, I was suddenly awakened by one of my companions, who\r\ncried out, that the captain was in distress, and was calling on us for\r\nassistance. I immediately aroused myself, and listened a moment, to hear\r\nif any thing further should be said, when the captain’s loud voice\r\narrested my attention. He was calling to the second mate, whose boat was\r\nnearer to him than mine. I made all haste to put about, ran down to him,\r\nand inquired what was the matter; he replied, “I have been attacked by\r\nan unknown fish, and he has stove my boat.” It appeared, that some large\r\nfish had accompanied the boat for a short distance, and had suddenly\r\nmade an unprovoked attack upon her, as nearly as they could determine,\r\nwith his jaws; the extreme darkness of the night prevented them from\r\ndistinguishing what kind of animal it was, but they judged it to be\r\nabout twelve feet in length, and one of the killer-fish species. After\r\nhaving struck the boat once, he continued to play about her, on every\r\nside, as if manifesting a disposition to renew the attack, and did a\r\nsecond time strike the bows of the boat, and split her stem. They had no\r\nother instrument of offence, but the sprit-pole, (a long slender piece\r\nof wood, by which the peak of the sail is extended,) with which, after\r\nrepeated attempts to destroy the boat, they succeeded in beating him\r\noff. I arrived, just as he had discontinued his operations, and\r\ndisappeared. He had made a considerable breach in the bows of the boat,\r\nthrough which the water had began to pour fast; and the captain,\r\nimagining matters to be considerably worse than they were, immediately\r\ntook measures to remove his provisions into the second mate’s boat and\r\nmine, in order to lighten his own, and by that means, and constant\r\nbailing, to keep her above water until daylight should enable him to\r\ndiscover the extent of the damage, and to repair it. The night was\r\nspissy darkness itself; the sky was completely overcast, and it seemed\r\nto us as if fate was wholly relentless, in pursuing us with such a cruel\r\ncomplication of disasters. We were not without our fears that the fish\r\nmight renew his attack, some time during the night, upon one of the\r\nother boats, and unexpectedly destroy us; but they proved entirely\r\ngroundless, as he was never afterwards seen. When daylight came, the\r\nwind again favoured us a little, and we all lay to, to repair the broken\r\nboat; which was effected by nailing on thin strips of boards in the\r\ninside; and having replaced the provisions, we proceeded again on our\r\ncourse. Our allowance of water, which in the commencement, merely served\r\nto administer to the positive demands of nature, became now to be\r\ninsufficient; and we began to experience violent thirst, from the\r\nconsumption of the provisions that had been wet with the salt water, and\r\ndried in the sun; of these we were obliged to eat first, to prevent\r\ntheir spoiling; and we could not, nay, we did not dare, to make any\r\nencroachments on our stock of water. Our determination was, to suffer as\r\nlong as human patience and endurance would hold out, having only in\r\nview, the relief that would be afforded us, when the quantity of wet\r\nprovisions should be exhausted. Our extreme sufferings here first\r\ncommenced. The privation of water is justly ranked among the most\r\ndreadful of the miseries of our life; the violence of raving thirst has\r\nno parallel in the catalogue of human calamities. It was our hard lot to\r\nhave felt this in its extremest force, when necessity subsequently\r\ncompelled us to seek resource from one of the offices of nature. We were\r\nnot, at first, aware of the consequences of eating this bread, and it\r\nwas not until the fatal effects of it had shown themselves to a degree\r\nof oppression, that we could divine the cause of our extreme thirst.\r\nBut, alas! there was no relief. Ignorant, or instructed of the fact, it\r\nwas alike immaterial; it composed a part of our subsistence, and reason\r\nimposed upon us the necessity of its immediate consumption, as otherwise\r\nit would have been lost to us entirely.\r\n\r\nNovember 29th. Our boats appeared to be growing daily more frail and\r\ninsufficient; the continual flowing of the water into them, seemed\r\nincreased, without our being able to assign it to any thing else, than a\r\ngeneral weakness, arising from causes that must in a short time, without\r\nsome remedy or relief, produce their total failure. We did not neglect,\r\nhowever, to patch up and mend them, according to our means, whenever we\r\ncould discover a broken or weak part. We this day found ourselves\r\nsurrounded by a shoal of dolphins; some, or one of which, we tried in\r\nvain a long time to take. We made a small line from some rigging that\r\nwas in the boat, fastened on one of the fish-hooks, and tied to it a\r\nsmall piece of white rag; they took not the least notice of it, but\r\ncontinued playing around us, nearly all day, mocking both our miseries\r\nand our efforts.\r\n\r\nNovember 30th. This was a remarkably fine day; the weather not exceeded\r\nby any that we had experienced since we left the wreck. At one o’clock,\r\nI proposed to our boat’s crew to kill one of the turtle; two of which we\r\nhad in our possession. I need not say, that the proposition was hailed\r\nwith the utmost enthusiasm; hunger had set its ravenous gnawings upon\r\nour stomachs, and we waited with impatience to suck the warm flowing\r\nblood of the animal. A small fire was kindled in the shell of the\r\nturtle, and after dividing the blood, (of which there was about a gill,)\r\namong those of us who felt disposed to drink it, we cooked the\r\nremainder, entrails and all, and enjoyed from it an unspeakably fine\r\nrepast. The stomachs of two or three revolted at the sight of the blood,\r\nand refused to partake of it; not even the outrageous thirst that was\r\nupon them could induce them to taste it; for myself, I took it like a\r\nmedicine, to relieve the extreme dryness of my palate, and stopped not\r\nto inquire whether it was any thing else than a liquid. After this, I\r\nmay say exquisite banquet, our bodies were considerably recruited, and I\r\nfelt my spirits now much higher than they had been at any time before.\r\nBy observation, this day we found ourselves in latitude 7° 53′ S. our\r\ndistance from the wreck, as nearly as we could calculate, was then about\r\nfour hundred and eighty miles.\r\n\r\nDecember 1st. From the 1st to the 3d of December, exclusive, there was\r\nnothing transpired of any moment. Our boats as yet kept admirably well\r\ntogether, and the weather was distinguished for its mildness and\r\nsalubrity. We gathered consolation too from a favourable slant which the\r\nwind took to NE. and our situation was not at that moment, we thought,\r\nso comfortless as we had been led at first to consider it; but, in our\r\nextravagant felicitations upon the blessing of the wind and weather, we\r\nforgot our leaks, our weak boats, our own debility, our immense distance\r\nfrom land, the smallness of our stock of provisions; all which, when\r\nbrought to mind, with the force which they deserved, were too well\r\ncalculated to dishearten us, and cause us to sigh for the hardships of\r\nour lot. Up to the 3d of December, the raging thirst of our mouths had\r\nnot been but in a small degree alleviated; had it not been for the pains\r\nwhich that gave us, we should have tasted, during this spell of fine\r\nweather, a species of enjoyment, derived from a momentary forgetfulness\r\nof our actual situation.\r\n\r\nDecember 3d. With great joy we hailed the last crumb of our damaged\r\nbread, and commenced this day to take our allowance of healthy\r\nprovisions. The salutary and agreeable effects of this change were felt\r\nat first in so slight a degree, as to give us no great cause of comfort\r\nor satisfaction; but gradually, as we partook of our small allowance of\r\nwater, the moisture began to collect in our mouths, and the parching\r\nfever of the palate imperceptibly left it. An accident here happened to\r\nus which gave us a great momentary spell of uneasiness. The night was\r\ndark, and the sky was completely overcast, so that we could scarcely\r\ndiscern each other’s boats, when at about ten o’clock, that of the\r\nsecond mate was suddenly missing. I felt for a moment considerable alarm\r\nat her unexpected disappearance; but after a little reflection I\r\nimmediately hove to, struck a light as expeditiously as possible, and\r\nhoisted it at the mast-head, in a lantern. Our eyes were now directed\r\nover every part of the ocean, in search of her, when, to our great joy,\r\nwe discerned an answering light, about a quarter of a mile to leeward of\r\nus; we ran down to it, and it proved to be the lost boat. Strange as the\r\nextraordinary interest which we felt in each other’s company may appear,\r\nand much as our repugnance to separation may seem to imply of weakness,\r\nit was the subject of our continual hopes and fears. It is truly\r\nremarked, that misfortune more than any thing else serves to endear us\r\nto our companions. So strongly was this sentiment engrafted upon our\r\nfeelings, and so closely were the destinies of all of us involuntarily\r\nlinked together, that, had one of the boats been wrecked, and wholly\r\nlost, with all her provisions and water, we should have felt ourselves\r\nconstrained, by every tie of humanity, to have taken the surviving\r\nsufferers into the other boats, and shared our bread and water with\r\nthem, while a crumb of one or a drop of the other remained. Hard,\r\nindeed, would the case have been for all, and much as I have since\r\nreflected on the subject, I have not been able to realize, had it so\r\nhappened, that a sense of our necessities would have allowed us to give\r\nso magnanimous and devoted a character to our feelings. I can only speak\r\nof the impressions which I recollect I had at the time. Subsequently,\r\nhowever, as our situation became more straightened and desperate, our\r\nconversation on this subject took a different turn; and it appeared to\r\nbe an universal sentiment, that such a course of conduct was calculated\r\nto weaken the chances of a final deliverance for some, and might be the\r\nonly means of consigning every soul of us to a horrid death of\r\nstarvation. There is no question but that an immediate separation,\r\ntherefore, was the most politic measure that could be adopted, and that\r\nevery boat should take its own separate chance: while we remained\r\ntogether, should any accident happen, of the nature alluded to, no other\r\ncourse could be adopted, than that of taking the survivers into the\r\nother boats, and giving up voluntarily, what we were satisfied could\r\nalone prolong our hopes, and multiply the chances of our safety, or\r\nunconcernedly witness their struggles in death, perhaps beat them from\r\nour boats, with weapons, back into the ocean. The expectation of\r\nreaching the land was founded upon a reasonable calculation of the\r\ndistance, the means, and the subsistence; all which were scanty enough,\r\nGod knows, and ill adapted to the probable exigences of the voyage. Any\r\naddition to our own demands, in this respect, would not only injure, but\r\nactually destroy the whole system which we had laid down, and reduce us\r\nto a slight hope, derived either from the speedy death of some of our\r\ncrew, or the falling in with some vessel. With all this, however, there\r\nwas a desperate instinct that bound us together; we could not reason on\r\nthe subject with any degree of satisfaction to our minds, yet we\r\ncontinued to cling to each other with a strong and involuntary impulse.\r\nThis, indeed, was a matter of no small difficulty, and it constituted,\r\nmore than any thing else, a source of continual watching and inquietude.\r\nWe would but turn our eyes away for a few moments, during some dark\r\nnights, and presently, one of the boats would be missing. There was no\r\nother remedy than to heave to immediately and set a light, by which the\r\nmissing boat might be directed to us. These proceedings necessarily\r\ninterfered very much with our speed, and consequently lessened our\r\nhopes; but we preferred to submit to it, while the consequences were not\r\nso immediately felt, rather than part with the consolation which each\r\nother’s presence afforded. Nothing of importance took place on the 4th\r\nof December; and on the 5th, at night, owing to the extreme darkness,\r\nand a strong wind, I again separated from the other boats. Finding they\r\nwere not to be seen in any direction, I loaded my pistol and fired it\r\ntwice; soon after the second discharge they made their appearance a\r\nshort distance to windward, and we joined company, and again kept on our\r\ncourse, in which we continued without any remarkable occurrence, through\r\nthe 6th and 7th of December. The wind during this period blew very\r\nstrong, and much more unfavourably. Our boats continued to leak, and to\r\ntake in a good deal of water over the gunwales.\r\n\r\nDecember 8th. In the afternoon of this day the wind set in E.SE. and\r\nbegan to blow much harder than we had yet experienced it; by twelve\r\no’clock at night it had increased to a perfect gale, with heavy showers\r\nof rain, and we now began, from these dreadful indications, to prepare\r\nourselves for destruction. We continued to take in sail by degrees, as\r\nthe tempest gradually increased, until at last we were obliged to take\r\ndown our masts. At this juncture we gave up entirely to the mercy of the\r\nwaves. The sea and rain had wet us to the skin, and we sat down,\r\nsilently, and with sullen resignation, awaiting our fate. We made an\r\neffort to catch some fresh water by spreading one of the sails, but\r\nafter having spent a long time, and obtained but a small quantity in a\r\nbucket, it proved to be quite as salt as that from the ocean: this we\r\nattributed to its having passed through the sail which had been so often\r\nwet by the sea, and upon which, after drying so frequently in the sun,\r\nconcretions of salt had been formed. It was a dreadful night—cut off\r\nfrom any imaginary relief—nothing remained but to await the approaching\r\nissue with firmness and resignation. The appearance of the heavens was\r\ndark and dreary, and the blackness that was spread over the face of the\r\nwaters dismal beyond description. The heavy squalls, that followed each\r\nother in quick succession, were preceded by sharp flashes of lightning,\r\nthat appeared to wrap our little barge in flames. The sea rose to a\r\nfearful height, and every wave that came looked as if it must be the\r\nlast that would be necessary for our destruction. To an overruling\r\nProvidence alone must be attributed our salvation from the horrors of\r\nthat terrible night. It can be accounted for in no other way: that a\r\nspeck of substance, like that which we were, before the driving terrors\r\nof the tempest, could have been conducted safely through it. At twelve\r\no’clock it began to abate a little in intervals of two or three minutes,\r\nduring which we would venture to raise up our heads and look to\r\nwindward. Our boat was completely unmanageable; without sails, mast, or\r\nrudder, and had been driven, in the course of the afternoon and night,\r\nwe knew not whither, nor how far. When the gale had in some measure\r\nsubsided we made efforts to get a little sail upon her, and put her head\r\ntowards the course we had been steering. My companions had not slept any\r\nduring the whole night, and were dispirited and broken down to such a\r\ndegree as to appear to want some more powerful stimulus than the fears\r\nof death to enable them to do their duty. By great exertions, however,\r\ntowards morning we again set a double-reefed mainsail and jib upon her,\r\nand began to make tolerable progress on the voyage. An unaccountable\r\ngood fortune had kept the boats together during all the troubles of the\r\nnight: and the sun rose and showed the disconsolate faces of our\r\ncompanions once more to each other.\r\n\r\nDecember 9th. By twelve o’clock this day we were enabled to set all sail\r\nas usual; but there continued to be a very heavy sea running, which\r\nopened the seams of the boats, and increased the leaks to an alarming\r\ndegree. There was, however, no remedy for this but continual bailing,\r\nwhich had now become to be an extremely irksome and laborious task. By\r\nobservation we found ourselves in latitude 17° 40′ S. At eleven o’clock\r\nat night, the captain’s boat was unexpectedly found to be missing. After\r\nthe last accident of this kind we had agreed, if the same should again\r\noccur, that, in order to save our time, the other boats should not heave\r\nto, as usual, but continue on their course until morning, and thereby\r\nsave the great detention that must arise from such repeated delays. We,\r\nhowever, concluded on this occasion to make a small effort, which, if it\r\ndid not immediately prove the means of restoring the lost boat, we would\r\ndiscontinue, and again make sail. Accordingly we hove to for an hour,\r\nduring which time I fired my pistol twice, and obtaining no tidings of\r\nthe boat, we stood on our course. When daylight appeared she was to\r\nleeward of us, about two miles; upon observing her we immediately ran\r\ndown, and again joined company.\r\n\r\nDecember 10th. I have omitted to notice the gradual advances which\r\nhunger and thirst, for the last six days, had made upon us. As the time\r\nhad lengthened since our departure from the wreck, and the allowance of\r\nprovision, making the demands of the appetite daily more and more\r\nimportunate, they had created in us an almost uncontrollable temptation\r\nto violate our resolution, and satisfy, for once, the hard yearnings of\r\nnature from our stock; but a little reflection served to convince us of\r\nthe imprudence and unmanliness of the measure, and it was abandoned with\r\na sort of melancholy effort of satisfaction. I had taken into custody,\r\nby common consent, all the provisions and water belonging to the boat,\r\nand was determined that no encroachments should be made upon it with my\r\nconsent; nay, I felt myself bound, by every consideration of duty, by\r\nevery dictate of sense, of prudence, and discretion, without which, in\r\nmy situation, all other exertions would have been folly itself, to\r\nprotect them, at the hazard of my life. For this purpose I locked up in\r\nmy chest the whole quantity, and never, for a single moment, closed my\r\neyes without placing some part of my person in contact with the chest;\r\nand having loaded my pistol, kept it constantly about me. I should not\r\ncertainly have put any threats in execution as long as the most distant\r\nhopes of reconciliation existed; and was determined, in case the least\r\nrefractory disposition should be manifested, (a thing which I\r\ncontemplated not unlikely to happen, with a set of starving wretches\r\nlike ourselves,) that I would immediately divide our subsistence into\r\nequal proportions, and give each man’s share into his own keeping. Then,\r\nshould any attempt be made upon mine, which I intended to mete out to\r\nmyself, according to exigences, I was resolved to make the consequences\r\nof it fatal. There was, however, the most upright and obedient behaviour\r\nin this respect manifested by every man in the boat, and I never had the\r\nleast opportunity of proving what my conduct would have been on such an\r\noccasion. While standing on our course this day we came across a small\r\nshoal of flying fish: four of which, in their efforts to avoid us, flew\r\nagainst the mainsail, and dropped into the boat; one, having fell near\r\nme, I eagerly snatched up and devoured; the other three were immediately\r\ntaken by the rest, and eaten alive. For the first time I, on this\r\noccasion, felt a disposition to laugh, upon witnessing the ludicrous and\r\nalmost desperate efforts of my five companions, who each sought to get a\r\nfish. They were very small of the kind, and constituted but an extremely\r\ndelicate mouthful, scales, wings, and all, for hungry stomachs like\r\nours. From the eleventh to the thirteenth of December inclusive, our\r\nprogress was very slow, owing to light winds and calms; and nothing\r\ntranspired of any moment, except that on the eleventh we killed the only\r\nremaining turtle, and enjoyed another luxuriant repast, that invigorated\r\nour bodies, and gave a fresh flow to our spirits. The weather was\r\nextremely hot, and we were exposed to the full force of a meridian sun,\r\nwithout any covering to shield us from its burning influence, or the\r\nleast breath of air to cool its parching rays. On the thirteenth day of\r\nDecember we were blessed with a change of wind to the northward, that\r\nbrought us a most welcome and unlooked for relief. We now, for the first\r\ntime, actually felt what might be deemed a reasonable hope of our\r\ndeliverance; and with hearts bounding with satisfaction, and bosoms\r\nswelling with joy, we made all sail to the eastward. We imagined we had\r\nrun out of the tradewinds, and had got into the variables, and should,\r\nin all probability, reach the land many days sooner than we expected.\r\nBut, alas! our anticipations were but a dream, from which we shortly\r\nexperienced a cruel awaking. The wind gradually died away, and at night\r\nwas succeeded by a perfect calm, more oppressive and disheartening to\r\nus, from the bright prospects which had attended during the day. The\r\ngloomy reflections that this hard fortune had given birth to, were\r\nsucceeded by others, of a no less cruel and discouraging nature, when we\r\nfound the calm continue during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth\r\nof December inclusive. The extreme oppression of the weather, the sudden\r\nand unexpected prostration of our hopes, and the consequent dejection of\r\nour spirits, set us again to thinking, and filled our souls with fearful\r\nand melancholy forebodings. In this state of affairs, seeing no\r\nalternative left us but to employ to the best advantage all human\r\nexpedients in our power, I proposed, on the fourteenth, to reduce our\r\nallowance of provisions one-half. No objections were made to this\r\narrangement: all submitted, or seemed to do so, with an admirable\r\nfortitude and forbearance. The proportion which our stock of water bore\r\nto our bread was not large; and while the weather continued so\r\noppressive, we did not think it adviseable to diminish our scanty\r\npittance; indeed, it would have been scarcely possible to have done so,\r\nwith any regard to our necessities, as our thirst had become now\r\nincessantly more intolerable than hunger, and the quantity then allowed\r\nwas barely sufficient to keep the mouth in a state of moisture, for\r\nabout one-third of the time. “Patience and long-suffering” was the\r\nconstant language of our lips: and a determination, strong as the\r\nresolves of the soul could make it, to cling to existence as long as\r\nhope and breath remained to us. In vain was every expedient tried to\r\nrelieve the raging fever of the throat by drinking salt water, and\r\nholding small quantities of it in the mouth, until, by that means, the\r\nthirst was increased to such a degree, as even to drive us to\r\ndespairing, and vain relief from our own urine. Our sufferings during\r\nthese calm days almost exceeded human belief. The hot rays of the sun\r\nbeat down upon us to such a degree, as to oblige us to hang over the\r\ngunwale of the boat, into the sea, to cool our weak and fainting bodies.\r\nThis expedient afforded us, however, a grateful relief, and was\r\nproductive of a discovery of infinite importance to us. No sooner had\r\none of us got on the outside of the gunwale than he immediately observed\r\nthe bottom of the boat to be covered with a species of small clam,\r\nwhich, upon being tasted, proved a most delicious and agreeable food.\r\nThis was no sooner announced to us, than we commenced to tear them off\r\nand eat them, for a few minutes, like a set of gluttons; and, after\r\nhaving satisfied the immediate craving of the stomach, we gathered large\r\nquantities and laid them up in the boat; but hunger came upon us again\r\nin less than half an hour afterwards, within which time they had all\r\ndisappeared. Upon attempting to get in again, we found ourselves so weak\r\nas to require each other’s assistance; indeed, had it not been for three\r\nof our crew, who could not swim, and who did not, therefore, get\r\noverboard, I know not by what means we should have been able to have\r\nresumed our situations in the boat.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth our boat continued to take in water so fast from her\r\nleaks, and the weather proving so moderate, we concluded to search out\r\nthe bad places, and endeavour to mend them as well as we should be able.\r\nAfter a considerable search, and, removing the ceiling near the bows, we\r\nfound the principal opening was occasioned by the starting of a plank or\r\nstreak in the bottom of the boat, next to the keel. To remedy this, it\r\nwas now absolutely necessary to have access to the bottom. The means of\r\ndoing which did not immediately occur to our minds. After a moment’s\r\nreflection, however, one of the crew, Benjamin Lawrence, offered to tie\r\na rope around his body, take a boat’s hatchet in his hand, and thus go\r\nunder the water, and hold the hatchet against a nail, to be driven\r\nthrough from the inside, for the purpose of clenching it. This was,\r\naccordingly, all effected, with some little trouble, and answered the\r\npurpose much beyond our expectations. Our latitude was this day 21° 42′\r\nSouth. The oppression of the weather still continuing through the\r\nsixteenth, bore upon our health and spirits with an amazing force and\r\nseverity. The most disagreeable excitements were produced by it, which,\r\nadded to the disconsolate endurance of the calm, called loudly for some\r\nmitigating expedient,—some sort of relief to our prolonged sufferings.\r\nBy our observations to-day we found, in addition to our other\r\ncalamities, that we had been urged back from our progress, by the heave\r\nof the sea, a distance of ten miles; and were still without any prospect\r\nof wind. In this distressing posture of our affairs, the captain\r\nproposed that we should commence rowing, which, being seconded by all,\r\nwe immediately concluded to take a double allowance of provision and\r\nwater for the day, and row, during the cool of the nights, until we\r\nshould get a breeze from some quarter or other. Accordingly, when night\r\ncame, we commenced our laborious operations: we made but a very sorry\r\nprogress. Hunger and thirst, and long inactivity, had so weakened us,\r\nthat in three hours every man gave out, and we abandoned the further\r\nprosecution of the plan. With the sunrise the next morning, on the\r\nseventeenth, a light breeze sprung up from the SE. and, although\r\ndirectly ahead, it was welcomed with almost frenzied feelings of\r\ngratitude and joy.\r\n\r\nDecember 18th. The wind had increased this day considerably, and by\r\ntwelve o’clock blew a gale; veering from SE. to E.SE. Again we were\r\ncompelled to take in all sail, and lie to for the principal part of the\r\nday. At night, however, it died away, and the next day, the nineteenth,\r\nproved very moderate and pleasant weather, and we again commenced to\r\nmake a little progress.\r\n\r\nDecember 20th. This was a day of great happiness and joy. After having\r\nexperienced one of the most distressing nights in the whole catalogue of\r\nour sufferings, we awoke to a morning of comparative luxury and\r\npleasure. About 7 o’clock, while we were sitting dispirited, silent, and\r\ndejected, in our boats, one of our companions suddenly and loudly called\r\nout, “there is land!” We were all aroused in an instant, as if\r\nelectrified, and casting our eyes to leeward, there indeed, was the\r\nblessed vision before us, “as plain and palpable” as could be wished\r\nfor. A new and extraordinary impulse now took possession of us. We shook\r\noff the lethargy of our senses, and seemed to take another, and a fresh\r\nexistence. One or two of my companions, whose lagging spirits, and worn\r\nout frames had begun to inspire them with an utter indifference to their\r\nfate, now immediately brightened up, and manifested a surprising\r\nalacrity and earnestness to gain, without delay, the much wished for\r\nshore. It appeared at first a low, white, beach, and lay like a basking\r\nparadise before our longing eyes. It was discovered nearly at the same\r\ntime by the other boats, and a general burst of joy and congratulation\r\nnow passed between us. It is not within the scope of human calculation,\r\nby a mere listener to the story, to divine what the feelings of our\r\nhearts were on this occasion. Alternate expectation, fear, gratitude,\r\nsurprise, and exultation, each swayed our minds, and quickened our\r\nexertions. We ran down for it, and at 11 o’clock, A. M. we were within a\r\nquarter of a mile of the shore. It was an island, to all appearance, as\r\nnearly as we could determine it, about six miles long, and three broad;\r\nwith a very high, rugged shore, and surrounded by rocks; the sides of\r\nthe mountains were bare, but on the tops it looked fresh and green with\r\nvegetation. Upon examining our navigators, we found it was Ducies\r\nIsland, lying in latitude 24° 40′ S. longitude 124° 40′ W. A short\r\nmoment sufficed for reflection, and we made immediate arrangements to\r\nland. None of us knew whether the island was inhabited or not, nor what\r\nit afforded, if any thing; if inhabited, it was uncertain whether by\r\nbeasts or savages; and a momentary suspense was created, by the dangers\r\nwhich might possibly arise by proceeding without due preparation and\r\ncare. Hunger and thirst, however, soon determined us, and having taken\r\nthe musket and pistols, I, with three others, effected a landing upon\r\nsome sunken rocks, and waded thence to the shore. Upon arriving at the\r\nbeach, it was necessary to take a little breath, and we laid down for a\r\nfew minutes to rest our weak bodies, before we could proceed. Let the\r\nreader judge, if he can, what must have been our feelings now! Bereft of\r\nall comfortable hopes of life, for the space of thirty days of terrible\r\nsuffering; our bodies wasted to mere skeletons, by hunger and thirst,\r\nand death itself staring us in the face; to be suddenly and unexpectedly\r\nconducted to a rich banquet of food and drink, which subsequently we\r\nenjoyed for a few days, to our full satisfaction; and he will have but a\r\nfaint idea of the happiness that here fell to our lot. We now, after a\r\nfew minutes, separated, and went different directions in search of\r\nwater; the want of which had been our principal privation, and called\r\nfor immediate relief. I had not proceeded far in my excursion, before I\r\ndiscovered a fish, about a foot and a half in length, swimming along in\r\nthe water close to the shore. I commenced an attack upon him with the\r\nbreach of my gun, and struck him, I believe, once, and he ran under a\r\nsmall rock, that lay near the shore, from whence I took him with the aid\r\nof my ramrod, and brought him up on the beach, and immediately fell to\r\neating. My companions soon joined in the repast; and in less than ten\r\nminutes, the whole was consumed, bones, and skin, and scales, and all.\r\nWith full stomachs, we imagined we could now attempt the mountains,\r\nwhere, if in any part of the island, we considered water would be most\r\nprobably obtained. I accordingly clambered, with excessive labour,\r\nsuffering, and pain, up amongst the bushes, roots, and underwood, of one\r\nof the crags, looking in all directions in vain, for every appearance of\r\nwater that might present itself. There was no indication of the least\r\nmoisture to be found, within the distance to which I had ascended,\r\nalthough my strength did not enable me to get higher than about 20 feet.\r\nI was sitting down at the height that I had attained, to gather a little\r\nbreath, and ruminating upon the fruitlessness of my search, and the\r\nconsequent evils and continuation of suffering that it necessarily\r\nimplied, when I perceived that the tide had risen considerably since our\r\nlanding, and threatened to cut off our retreat to the rocks, by which\r\nalone we should be able to regain our boats. I therefore determined to\r\nproceed again to the shore, and inform the captain and the rest of our\r\nwant of success in procuring water, and consult upon the propriety of\r\nremaining at the island any longer. I never for one moment lost sight of\r\nthe main chance, which I conceived we still had, of either getting to\r\nthe coast, or of meeting with some vessel at sea; and felt that every\r\nminute’s detention, without some equivalent object, was lessening those\r\nchances, by a consumption of the means of our support. When I had got\r\ndown, one of my companions informed me, that he had found a place in a\r\nrock some distance off, from which the water exuded in small drops, at\r\nintervals of about five minutes; that he had, by applying his lips to\r\nthe rock, obtained a few of them, which only served to whet his\r\nappetite, and from which nothing like the least satisfaction had\r\nproceeded. I immediately resolved in my own mind, upon this information,\r\nto advise remaining until morning, to endeavour to make a more thorough\r\nsearch the next day, and with our hatchets to pick away the rock which\r\nhad been discovered, with the view of increasing, if possible, the run\r\nof the water. We all repaired again to our boats, and there found that\r\nthe captain had the same impressions as to the propriety of our delay\r\nuntil morning. We therefore landed; and having hauled our boats up on\r\nthe beach, laid down in them that night, free from all the anxieties of\r\nwatching and labour, and amid all our sufferings, gave ourselves up to\r\nan unreserved forgetfulness and peace of mind, that seemed so well to\r\naccord with the pleasing anticipations that this day had brought forth.\r\nIt was but a short space, however, until the morning broke upon us; and\r\nsense, and feeling, and gnawing hunger, and the raging fever of thirst\r\nthen redoubled my wishes and efforts to explore the island again. We had\r\nobtained, that night, a few crabs, by traversing the shore a\r\nconsiderable distance, and a few very small fish; but waited until the\r\nnext day, for the labours of which, we considered a night of refreshing\r\nand undisturbed repose would better qualify us.\r\n\r\nDecember 21st. We had still reserved our common allowance, but it was\r\nentirely inadequate for the purpose of supplying the raging demands of\r\nthe palate; and such an excessive and cruel thirst was created, as\r\nalmost to deprive us of the power of speech. The lips became cracked and\r\nswollen, and a sort of glutinous saliva collected in the mouth,\r\ndisagreeable to the taste, and intolerable beyond expression. Our bodies\r\nhad wasted away to almost skin and bone, and possessed so little\r\nstrength, as often to require each other’s assistance in performing some\r\nof its weakest functions. Relief, we now felt, must come soon, or nature\r\nwould sink. The most perfect discipline was still maintained, in respect\r\nto our provisions; and it now became our whole object, if we should not\r\nbe able to replenish our subsistence from the island, to obtain, by some\r\nmeans or other, a sufficient refreshment to enable us to prosecute our\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nOur search for water accordingly again commenced with the morning; each\r\nof us took a different direction, and prosecuted the examination of\r\nevery place where there was the least indication of it; the small leaves\r\nof the shrubbery, affording a temporary alleviation, by being chewed in\r\nthe mouth, and but for the peculiarly bitter taste which those of the\r\nisland possessed, would have been an extremely grateful substitute. In\r\nthe course of our rambles too, along the sides of the mountain, we would\r\nnow and then meet with tropic birds, of a beautiful figure and plumage,\r\noccupying small holes in the sides of it, from which we plucked them\r\nwithout the least difficulty. Upon our approaching them they made no\r\nattempts to fly, nor did they appear to notice us at all. These birds\r\nserved us for a fine repast; numbers of which were caught in the course\r\nof the day, cooked by fires which we made on the shore, and eaten with\r\nthe utmost avidity. We found also a plant, in taste not unlike the\r\npeppergrass, growing in considerable abundance in the crevices of the\r\nrocks, and which proved to us a very agreeable food, by being chewed\r\nwith the meat of the birds. These, with birds’ nests, some of them full\r\nof young, and others of eggs, a few of which we found in the course of\r\nthe day, served us for food, and supplied the place of our bread; from\r\nthe use of which, during our stay here, we had restricted ourselves. But\r\nwater, the great object of all our anxieties and exertions, was no where\r\nto be found, and we began to despair of meeting with it on the island.\r\nOur state of extreme weakness, and many of us without shoes or any\r\ncovering for the feet, prevented us from exploring any great distance;\r\nlest by some sudden faintness, or over exertion, we should not be able\r\nto return, and at night be exposed to attacks of wild beasts, which\r\nmight inhabit the island, and be alike incapable of resistance, as\r\nbeyond the reach of the feeble assistance that otherwise could be\r\nafforded to each. The whole day was thus consumed in picking up whatever\r\nhad the least shape or quality of sustenance, and another night of\r\nmisery was before us, to be passed without a drop of water to cool our\r\nparching tongues. In this state of affairs, we could not reconcile it to\r\nourselves to remain longer at this place; a day, an hour, lost to us\r\nunnecessarily here, might cost us our preservation. A drop of the water\r\nthat we then had in our possession might prove, in the last stages of\r\nour debility, the very cordial of life. I addressed the substance of\r\nthese few reflections to the captain, who agreed with me in opinion,\r\nupon the necessity of taking some decisive steps in our present dilemma.\r\nAfter some considerable conversation on this subject, it was finally\r\nconcluded, to spend the succeeding day in the further search for water,\r\nand if none should be found, to quit the island the morning after.\r\n\r\nDecember 22d. We had been employed during the last night in various\r\noccupations, according to the feelings or the wants of the men; some\r\ncontinued to wander about the shore, and to short distances in the\r\nmountains, still seeking for food and water; others hung about the\r\nbeach, near the edge of the sea, endeavouring to take the little fish\r\nthat came about them. Some slept, insensible to every feeling but rest;\r\nwhile others spent the night in talking of their situation, and\r\nreasoning upon the probabilities of their deliverance. The dawn of day\r\naroused us again to labour, and each of us pursued his own inclination,\r\nas to the course taken over the island after water. My principal hope\r\nwas founded upon my success in picking the rocks where the moisture had\r\nbeen discovered the day before, and thither I hastened as soon as my\r\nstrength would enable me to get there. It was about a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom what I may call our encampment; and with two men, who had\r\naccompanied me, I commenced my labours with a hatchet and an old chisel.\r\nThe rock proved to be very soft, and in a very short time I had obtained\r\na considerable hole, but, alas! without the least wished-for effect. I\r\nwatched it for some little time with great anxiety, hoping that, as I\r\nincreased the depth of the hole, the water would presently flow; but all\r\nmy hopes and efforts were unavailing, and at last I desisted from\r\nfurther labour, and sat down near it in utter despair. As I turned my\r\neyes towards the beach I saw some of the men in the act of carrying a\r\nkeg along from the boats, with, I thought, an extraordinary spirit and\r\nactivity; and the idea suddenly darted across my mind that they had\r\nfound water, and were taking a keg to fill it. I quitted my seat in a\r\nmoment, made the best of my way towards them, with a palpitating heart,\r\nand before I came up with them, they gave me the cheering news that they\r\nhad found a spring of water. I felt, at that moment, as if I could have\r\nfallen down and thanked God for this signal act of his mercy. The\r\nsensation that I experienced was indeed strange, and such as I shall\r\nnever forget. At one instant I felt an almost choking excess of joy, and\r\nat the next I wanted the relief of a flood of tears. When I arrived at\r\nthe spot, whither I had hastened as fast as my weak legs would carry me,\r\nI found my companions had all taken their fill, and with an extreme\r\ndegree of forbearance I then satisfied myself, by drinking in small\r\nquantities, and at intervals of two or three minutes apart. Many had,\r\nnotwithstanding the remonstrances of prudence, and, in some cases,\r\nforce, laid down and thoughtlessly swallowed large quantities of it,\r\nuntil they could drink no more. The effect of this was, however, neither\r\nso sudden nor bad as we had imagined; it only served to make them a\r\nlittle stupid and indolent for the remainder of the day.\r\n\r\nUpon examining the place from whence we had obtained this miraculous and\r\nunexpected succour, we were equally astonished and delighted with the\r\ndiscovery. It was on the shore, above which the sea flowed to the depth\r\nof near six feet; and we could procure the water, therefore, from it\r\nonly when the tide was down. The crevice from which it rose was in a\r\nflat rock, large surfaces of which were spread around, and composed the\r\nface of the beach. We filled our two kegs before the tide rose, and went\r\nback again to our boats. The remainder of this day was spent in seeking\r\nfor fish, crabs, birds, and any thing else that fell in our way, that\r\ncould contribute to satisfy our appetites; and we enjoyed, during that\r\nnight, a most comfortable and delicious sleep, unattended with those\r\nviolent cravings of hunger and thirst, that had poisoned our slumbers\r\nfor so many previous ones. Since the discovery of the water, too, we\r\nbegan to entertain different notions altogether of our situation. There\r\nwas no doubt we might here depend upon a constant and ample supply of it\r\nas long as we chose to remain, and, in all probability, we could manage\r\nto obtain food, until the island should be visited by some vessel, or\r\ntime allowed to devise other means of leaving it. Our boats would still\r\nremain to us: a stay here might enable us to mend, strengthen, and put\r\nthem in more perfect order for the sea, and get ourselves so far\r\nrecruited as to be able to endure, if necessary, a more protracted\r\nvoyage to the main land. I made a silent determination in my own mind\r\nthat I would myself pursue something like this plan, whatever might be\r\nthe opinion of the rest; but I found no difference in the views of any\r\nof us as to this matter. We, therefore, concluded to remain at least\r\nfour or five days, within which time it could be sufficiently known\r\nwhether it would be adviseable to make any arrangements for a more\r\npermanent abode.\r\n\r\nDecember 23d. At 11 o’clock, A. M. we again visited our spring: the tide\r\nhad fallen to about a foot below it, and we were able to procure, before\r\nit rose again, about twenty gallons of water. It was at first a little\r\nbrackish, but soon became fresh, from the constant supply from the rock,\r\nand the departure of the sea. Our observations this morning tended to\r\ngive us every confidence in its quantity and quality, and we, therefore,\r\nrested perfectly easy in our minds on the subject, and commenced to make\r\nfurther discoveries about the island. Each man sought for his own daily\r\nliving, on whatsoever the mountains, the shore, or the sea, could\r\nfurnish him with; and every day, during our stay there, the whole time\r\nwas employed in roving about for food. We found, however, on the\r\ntwenty-fourth, that we had picked up, on the island, every thing that\r\ncould be got at, in the way of sustenance; and, much to our surprise,\r\nsome of the men came in at night and complained of not having gotten\r\nsufficient during the day to satisfy the cravings of their stomachs.\r\nEvery accessible part of the mountain, contiguous to us, or within the\r\nreach of our weak enterprise, was already ransacked, for birds’ eggs and\r\ngrass, and was rifled of all that they contained: so that we began to\r\nentertain serious apprehensions that we should not be able to live long\r\nhere; at any rate, with the view of being prepared, as well as possible,\r\nshould necessity at any time oblige us to quit it, we commenced, on the\r\ntwenty-fourth, to repair our boats, and continued to work upon them all\r\nthat and the succeeding day. We were enabled to do this, with much\r\nfacility, by drawing them up and turning them over on the beach, working\r\nby spells of two or three hours at a time, and then leaving off to seek\r\nfor food. We procured our water daily, when the tide would leave the\r\nshore: but on the evening of the twenty-fifth, found that a fruitless\r\nsearch for nourishment had not repaid us for the labours of a whole day.\r\nThere was no one thing on the island upon which we could in the least\r\ndegree rely, except the peppergrass, and of that the supply was\r\nprecarious, and not much relished without some other food. Our situation\r\nhere, therefore, now became worse than it would have been in our boats\r\non the ocean; because, in the latter case, we should be still making\r\nsome progress towards the land, while our provisions lasted, and the\r\nchance of falling in with some vessel be considerably increased. It was\r\ncertain that we ought not to remain here unless upon the strongest\r\nassurances in our own minds, of sufficient sustenance, and that, too, in\r\nregular supplies, that might be depended upon. After much conversation\r\namongst us on this subject, and again examining our navigators, it was\r\nfinally concluded to set sail for Easter Island, which we found to be\r\nE.SE. from us in latitude 27° 9′ S. longitude 109° 35′ W. All we knew of\r\nthis island was, that it existed as laid down in the books; but of its\r\nextent, productions, or inhabitants, if any, we were entirely ignorant;\r\nat any rate, it was nearer by eight hundred and fifty miles to the\r\ncoast, and could not be worse in its productions than the one we were\r\nabout leaving.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-sixth of December was wholly employed in preparations for our\r\ndeparture; our boats were hauled down to the vicinity of the spring, and\r\nour casks, and every thing else that would contain it, filled with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThere had been considerable talk between three of our companions, about\r\ntheir remaining on this island, and taking their chance both for a\r\nliving, and an escape from it; and as the time drew near at which we\r\nwere to leave, they made up their minds to stay behind. The rest of us\r\ncould make no objection to their plan, as it lessened the load of our\r\nboats, allowed us their share of the provisions, and the probability of\r\ntheir being able to sustain themselves on the island was much stronger\r\nthan that of our reaching the main land. Should we, however, ever arrive\r\nsafely, it would become our duty, and we so assured them, to give\r\ninformation of their situation, and make every effort to procure their\r\nremoval from thence; which we accordingly afterwards did.\r\n\r\nTheir names were William Wright of Barnstable, Massachusetts, Thomas\r\nChapple of Plymouth, England, and Seth Weeks of the former place. They\r\nhad begun, before we came away, to construct a sort of habitation,\r\ncomposed of the branches of trees, and we left with them every little\r\narticle that could be spared from the boats. It was their intention to\r\nbuild a considerable dwelling, that would protect them from the rains,\r\nas soon as time and materials could be provided. The captain wrote\r\nletters, to be left on the island, giving information of the fate of the\r\nship, and that of our own; and stating that we had set out to reach\r\nEaster Island, with further particulars, intended to give notice (should\r\nour fellow-sufferers die there, and the place be ever visited by any\r\nvessel,) of our misfortunes. These letters were put in a tin case,\r\nenclosed in a small wooden box, and nailed to a tree, on the west side\r\nof the island, near our landing place. We had observed, some days\r\npreviously, the name of a ship, “The Elizabeth,” cut out in the bark of\r\nthis tree, which rendered it indubitable that one of that name had once\r\ntouched here. There was, however, no date to it, or any thing else, by\r\nwhich any further particulars could be made out.\r\n\r\nDecember 27th. I went, before we set sail this morning, and procured for\r\neach boat a flat stone, and two arms-full of wood, with which to make a\r\nfire in our boats, should it become afterwards necessary in the further\r\nprosecution of our voyage; as we calculated we might catch a fish, or a\r\nbird, and in that case be provided with the means of cooking it;\r\notherwise, from the intense heat of the weather, we knew they could not\r\nbe preserved from spoiling. At ten o’clock, A. M. the tide having risen\r\nfar enough to allow our boats to float over the rocks, we made all sail,\r\nand steered around the island, for the purpose of making a little\r\nfurther observation, which would not detain us any time, and might be\r\nproductive of some unexpected good fortune. Before we started we missed\r\nour three companions, and found they had not come down, either to assist\r\nus to get off, nor to take any kind of leave of us. I walked up the\r\nbeach towards their rude dwelling, and informed them that we were then\r\nabout to set sail, and should probably never see them more. They seemed\r\nto be very much affected, and one of them shed tears. They wished us to\r\nwrite to their relations, should Providence safely direct us again to\r\nour homes, and said but little else. They had every confidence in being\r\nable to procure a subsistence there as long as they remained: and,\r\nfinding them ill at heart about taking any leave of us, I hastily bid\r\nthem “good-bye,” hoped they would do well, and came away. They followed\r\nme with their eyes until I was out of sight, and I never saw more of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn the NW. side of the island we perceived a fine white beach, on which\r\nwe imagined we might land, and in a short time ascertain if any further\r\nuseful discoveries could be effected, or any addition made to our stock\r\nof provisions; and having set ashore five or six of the men for this\r\npurpose, the rest of us shoved off the boats and commenced fishing. We\r\nsaw a number of sharks, but all efforts to take them proved ineffectual;\r\nand we got but a few small fish, about the size of a mackerel, which we\r\ndivided amongst us. In this business we were occupied for the remainder\r\nof the day, until six o’clock in the afternoon, when the men, having\r\nreturned to the shore from their search in the mountains, brought a few\r\nbirds, and we again set sail and steered directly for Easter Island.\r\nDuring that night, after we had got quite clear of the land, we had a\r\nfine strong breeze from the NW.; we kept our fires going, and cooked our\r\nfish and birds, and felt our situation as comfortable as could be\r\nexpected. We continued on our course, consuming our provisions and water\r\nas sparingly as possible, without any material incident, until the\r\nthirtieth, when the wind hauled out E.SE. directly ahead, and so\r\ncontinued until the thirty-first, when it again came to the northward;\r\nand we resumed our course.\r\n\r\nOn the third of January we experienced heavy squalls from the W.SW.\r\naccompanied with dreadful thunder and lightning, that threw a gloomy and\r\ncheerless aspect over the ocean, and incited a recurrence of some of\r\nthose heavy and desponding moments that we had before experienced. We\r\ncommenced from Ducies Island to keep a regular reckoning, by which, on\r\nthe fourth of January, we found we had got to the southward of Easter\r\nIsland, and the wind prevailing E.NE. we should not be able to get on to\r\nthe eastward, so as to reach it. Our birds and fish were all now\r\nconsumed, and we had begun again upon our short allowance of bread. It\r\nwas necessary, in this state of things, to change our determination of\r\ngoing to Easter Island, and shape our course in some other direction,\r\nwhere the wind would allow of our going. We had but little hesitation in\r\nconcluding, therefore, to steer for the island of Juan Fernandez, which\r\nlay about E.SE. from us, distant two thousand five hundred miles. We\r\nbent our course accordingly towards it, having for the two succeeding\r\ndays very light winds, and suffering excessively from the intense heat\r\nof the sun. The seventh brought us a change of wind to the northward,\r\nand at twelve o’clock we found ourselves in latitude 30° 18′ S,\r\nlongitude 117° 29′ W. We continued to make what progress we could to the\r\neastward.\r\n\r\nJanuary 10th. Matthew P. Joy, the second mate, had suffered from\r\ndebility, and the privations we had experienced, much beyond any of the\r\nrest of us, and was on the eighth removed to the captain’s boat, under\r\nthe impression that he would be more comfortable there, and more\r\nattention and pains be bestowed in nursing and endeavouring to comfort\r\nhim. This day being calm, he manifested a desire to be taken back again;\r\nbut at 4 o’clock in the afternoon, after having been, according to his\r\nwishes, placed in his own boat, he died very suddenly after his removal.\r\nOn the eleventh, at six o’clock in the morning, we sewed him up in his\r\nclothes, tied a large stone to his feet, and, having brought all the\r\nboats to, consigned him in a solemn manner to the ocean. This man did\r\nnot die of absolute starvation, although his end was no doubt very much\r\nhastened by his sufferings. He had a weak and sickly constitution, and\r\ncomplained of being unwell the whole voyage. It was an incident,\r\nhowever, which threw a gloom over our feelings for many days. In\r\nconsequence of his death, one man from the captain’s boat was placed in\r\nthat from which he died, to supply his place, and we stood away again on\r\nour course.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of Jan. we had the wind from the NW. which commenced in the\r\nmorning, and came on to blow before night a perfect gale. We were\r\nobliged to take in all sail and run before the wind. Flashes of\r\nlightning were quick and vivid, and the rain came down in cataracts. As\r\nhowever the gale blew us fairly on our course, and our speed being great\r\nduring the day, we derived, I may say, even pleasure from the\r\nuncomfortableness and fury of the storm. We were apprehensive that in\r\nthe darkness of this night we should be separated, and made\r\narrangements, each boat to keep an E.SE. course all night. About eleven\r\no’clock my boat being ahead a short distance of the others, I turned my\r\nhead back, as I was in the habit of doing every minute, and neither of\r\nthe others were to be seen. It was blowing and raining at this time as\r\nif the heavens were separating, and I knew not hardly at the moment what\r\nto do. I hove my boat to the wind, and lay drifting about an hour,\r\nexpecting every moment that they would come up with me, but not seeing\r\nany thing of them, I put away again, and stood on the course agreed\r\nupon, with strong hopes that daylight would enable me to discover them\r\nagain. When the morning dawned, in vain did we look over every part of\r\nthe ocean for our companions; they were gone! and we saw no more of them\r\nafterwards. It was folly to repine at the circumstance; it could neither\r\nbe remedied, nor could sorrow secure their return; but it was impossible\r\nto prevent ourselves feeling all the poignancy and bitterness that\r\ncharacterizes the separation of men who have long suffered in each\r\nother’s company, and whose interests and feelings fate had so closely\r\nlinked together. By our observation, we separated in lat. 32° 16′ S.\r\nlong. 112° 20′ W. For many days after this accident, our progress was\r\nattended with dull and melancholy reflections. We had lost the cheering\r\nof each other’s faces, that, which strange as it is, we so much required\r\nin both our mental and bodily distresses. The 14th January proved\r\nanother very squally and rainy day. We had now been nineteen days from\r\nthe island, and had only made a distance about 900 miles: necessity\r\nbegan to whisper us, that a still further reduction of our allowance\r\nmust take place, or we must abandon altogether the hopes of reaching the\r\nland, and rely wholly on the chance of being taken up by a vessel. But\r\nhow to reduce the daily quantity of food, with any regard to life\r\nitself, was a question of the utmost consequence. Upon our first leaving\r\nthe wreck, the demands of the stomach had been circumscribed to the\r\nsmallest possible compass; and subsequently before reaching the island,\r\na diminution had taken place of nearly one-half; and it was now, from a\r\nreasonable calculation, become necessary even to curtail that at least\r\none-half; which must, in a short time, reduce us to mere skeletons\r\nagain. We had a full allowance of water, but it only served to\r\ncontribute to our debility; our bodies deriving but the scanty support\r\nwhich an ounce and a half of bread for each man afforded. It required a\r\ngreat effort to bring matters to this dreadful alternative, either to\r\nfeed our bodies and our hopes a little longer, or in the agonies of\r\nhunger to seize upon and devour our provisions, and coolly await the\r\napproach of death.\r\n\r\nWe were as yet, just able to move about in our boats, and slowly perform\r\nthe necessary labours appertaining to her; but we were fast wasting away\r\nwith the relaxing effects of the water, and we daily almost perished\r\nunder the torrid rays of a meridian sun; to escape which, we would lie\r\ndown in the bottom of the boat, cover ourselves over with the sails, and\r\nabandon her to the mercy of the waves. Upon attempting to rise again,\r\nthe blood would rush into the head, and an intoxicating blindness come\r\nover us, almost to occasion our suddenly falling down again. A slight\r\ninterest was still kept up in our minds by the distant hopes of yet\r\nmeeting with the other boats, but it was never realized. An accident\r\noccurred at night, which gave me a great cause of uneasiness, and led me\r\nto an unpleasant rumination upon the probable consequences of a\r\nrepetition of it. I had laid down in the boat without taking the usual\r\nprecaution of securing the lid of the provision-chest as I was\r\naccustomed to do, when one of the white men awoke me, and informed me\r\nthat one of the blacks had taken some bread from it. I felt at the\r\nmoment the highest indignation and resentment at such conduct in any of\r\nour crew, and immediately took my pistol in my hand, and charged him if\r\nhe had taken any, to give it up without the least hesitation, or I\r\nshould instantly shoot him!—He became at once very much alarmed, and,\r\ntrembling, confessed the fact, pleading the hard necessity that urged\r\nhim to it: he appeared to be very penitent for his crime, and earnestly\r\nswore that he would never be guilty of it again. I could not find it in\r\nmy soul to extend towards him the least severity on this account,\r\nhowever much, according to the strict imposition which we felt upon\r\nourselves it might demand it. This was the first infraction; and the\r\nsecurity of our lives, our hopes of redemption from our sufferings,\r\nloudly called for a prompt and signal punishment; but every humane\r\nfeeling of nature plead in his behalf, and he was permitted to escape,\r\nwith the solemn injunction, that a repetition of the same offence would\r\ncost him his life.\r\n\r\nI had almost determined upon this occurrence to divide our provisions,\r\nand give to each man his share of the whole stock; and should have done\r\nso in the height of my resentment, had it not been for the reflection\r\nthat some might, by imprudence, be tempted to go beyond the daily\r\nallowance or consume it all at once, and bring on a premature weakness\r\nor starvation: this would of course disable them for the duties of the\r\nboat, and reduce our chances of safety and deliverance.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of January, at night, a very large shark was observed\r\nswimming about us in a most ravenous manner, making attempts every now\r\nand then upon different parts of the boat, as if he would devour the\r\nvery wood with hunger; he came several times and snapped at the steering\r\noar, and even the stern-post. We tried in vain to stab him with a lance,\r\nbut we were so weak as not to be able to make any impression upon his\r\nhard skin; he was so much larger than an ordinary one, and manifested\r\nsuch a fearless malignity, as to make us afraid of him; and our utmost\r\nefforts, which were at first directed to kill him for prey, became in\r\nthe end self-defense. Baffled however in all his hungry attempts upon\r\nus, he shortly made off.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of January, we were surrounded with porpoises in great\r\nnumbers, that followed us nearly an hour, and which also defied all\r\nmanœuvres to catch them. The 17th and 18th proved to be calm; and the\r\ndistresses of a cheerless prospect and a burning hot sun, were again\r\nvisited upon our devoted heads.\r\n\r\nWe began to think that Divine Providence had abandoned us at last; and\r\nit was but an unavailing effort to endeavour to prolong a now tedious\r\nexistence. Horrible were the feelings that took possession of us!—The\r\ncontemplation of a death of agony and torment, refined by the most\r\ndreadful and distressing reflections, absolutely prostrated both body\r\nand soul. There was not a hope now remaining to us but that which was\r\nderived from a sense of the mercies of our Creator. The night of the\r\n18th was a despairing era in our sufferings; our minds were wrought up\r\nto the highest pitch of dread and apprehension for our fate, and all in\r\nthem was dark, gloomy, and confused. About 8 o’clock, the terrible noise\r\nof whale-spouts near us sounded in our ears: we could distinctly hear\r\nthe furious thrashing of their tails in the water, and our weak minds\r\npictured out their appalling and hideous aspects. One of my companions,\r\nthe black man, took an immediate fright, and solicited me to take out\r\nthe oars, and endeavour to get away from them. I consented to his using\r\nany means for that purpose; but alas! it was wholly out of our power to\r\nraise a single arm in our own defence. Two or three of the whales came\r\ndown near us, and went swiftly off across our stern, blowing and\r\nspouting at a terrible rate; they, however, after an hour or two\r\ndisappeared, and we saw no more of them. The next day, the 19th of\r\nJanuary, we had extremely boisterous weather, with rain, heavy thunder\r\nand lightning, which reduced us again to the necessity of taking in all\r\nsail and lying to. The wind blew from every point of the compass within\r\nthe twenty-four hours, and at last towards the next morning settled at\r\nE.NE. a strong breeze.\r\n\r\nJanuary 20. The black man, Richard Peterson, manifested to-day symptoms\r\nof a speedy dissolution; he had been lying between the seats in the\r\nboat, utterly dispirited and broken down, without being able to do the\r\nleast duty, or hardly to place his hand to his head for the last three\r\ndays, and had this morning made up his mind to die rather than endure\r\nfurther misery: he refused his allowance; said he was sensible of his\r\napproaching end, and was perfectly ready to die: in a few minutes he\r\nbecame speechless, the breath appeared to be leaving his body without\r\nproducing the least pain, and at four o’clock he was gone. I had two\r\ndays previously, conversations with him on the subject of religion, on\r\nwhich he reasoned very sensibly, and with much composure; and begged me\r\nto let his wife know his fate, if ever I reached home in safety. The\r\nnext morning we committed him to the sea, in latitude 35° 07′ S.\r\nlongitude 105° 46′ W. The wind prevailed to the eastward until the 24th\r\nof January, when it again fell calm. We were now in a most wretched and\r\nsinking state of debility, hardly able to crawl around the boat, and\r\npossessing but strength enough to convey our scanty morsel to our\r\nmouths. When I perceived this morning that it was calm, my fortitude\r\nalmost forsook me. I thought to suffer another scorching day, like the\r\nlast we had experienced, would close before night the scene of our\r\nmiseries; and I felt many a despairing moment that day, that had well\r\nnigh proved fatal. It required an effort to look calmly forward, and\r\ncontemplate what was yet in store for us, beyond what I felt I was\r\ncapable of making; and what it was that buoyed me above all the terrors\r\nwhich surrounded us, God alone knows. Our ounce and a half of bread,\r\nwhich was to serve us all day, was in some cases greedily devoured, as\r\nif life was to continue but another moment; and at other times, it was\r\nhoarded up and eaten crumb by crumb, at regular intervals during the\r\nday, as if it was to last us for ever. To add to our calamities, biles\r\nbegan to break out upon us, and our imaginations shortly became as\r\ndiseased as our bodies. I laid down at night to catch a few moments of\r\noblivious sleep, and immediately my starving fancy was at work. I dreamt\r\nof being placed near a splendid and rich repast, where there was every\r\nthing that the most dainty appetite could desire; and of contemplating\r\nthe moment in which we were to commence to eat with enraptured feelings\r\nof delight; and just as I was about to partake of it, I suddenly awoke\r\nto the cold realities of my miserable situation. Nothing could have\r\noppressed me so much. It set such a longing frenzy for victuals in my\r\nmind, that I felt as if I could have wished the dream to continue for\r\never, that I never might have awoke from it. I cast a sort of vacant\r\nstare about the boat, until my eyes rested upon a bit of tough cow-hide,\r\nwhich was fastened to one of the oars; I eagerly seized and commenced to\r\nchew it, but there was no substance in it, and it only served to fatigue\r\nmy weak jaws, and add to my bodily pains. My fellow-sufferers murmured\r\nvery much the whole time, and continued to press me continually with\r\nquestions upon the probability of our reaching land again. I kept\r\nconstantly rallying my spirits to enable me to afford them comfort. I\r\nencouraged them to bear up against all evils, and if we must perish, to\r\ndie in our own cause, and not weakly distrust the providence of the\r\nAlmighty, by giving ourselves up to despair. I reasoned with them, and\r\ntold them that we would not die sooner by keeping up our hopes; that the\r\ndreadful sacrifices and privations we endured were to preserve us from\r\ndeath, and were not to be put in competition with the price which we set\r\nupon our lives, and their value to our families: it was, besides,\r\nunmanly to repine at what neither admitted of alleviation nor cure; and\r\nwithal, that it was our solemn duty to recognise in our calamities an\r\noverruling divinity, by whose mercy we might be suddenly snatched from\r\nperil, and to rely upon him alone, “Who tempers the wind to the shorn\r\nlamb.”\r\n\r\nThe three following days, the 25th, 26th, and 27th, were not\r\ndistinguished by any particular circumstances. The wind still prevailed\r\nto the eastward, and by its obduracy, almost tore the very hopes of our\r\nhearts away: it was impossible to silence the rebellious repinings of\r\nour nature, at witnessing such a succession of hard fortune against us.\r\nIt was our cruel lot not to have had one bright anticipation\r\nrealized—not one wish of our thirsting souls gratified. We had, at the\r\nend of these three days, been urged to the southward as far as latitude\r\n36° into a chilly region, where rains and squalls prevailed; and we now\r\ncalculated to tack and stand back to the northward: after much labour,\r\nwe got our boat about; and so great was the fatigue attending this small\r\nexertion of our bodies, that we all gave up for a moment and abandoned\r\nher to her own course.—Not one of us had now strength sufficient to\r\nsteer, or indeed to make one single effort towards getting the sails\r\nproperly trimmed, to enable us to make any headway. After an hour or two\r\nof relaxation, during which the horrors of our situation came upon us\r\nwith a despairing force and effect, we made a sudden effort and got our\r\nsails into such a disposition, as that the boat would steer herself; and\r\nwe then threw ourselves down, awaiting the issue of time to bring us\r\nrelief, or to take us from the scene of our troubles. We could now do\r\nnothing more; strength and spirits were totally gone; and what indeed\r\ncould have been the narrow hopes, that in our situation, then bound us\r\nto life?\r\n\r\nJanuary 28. Our spirits this morning were hardly sufficient to allow of\r\nour enjoying a change of the wind, which took place to the westward.—It\r\nhad nearly become indifferent to us from what quarter it blew: nothing\r\nbut the slight chance of meeting with a vessel remained to us now: it\r\nwas this narrow comfort alone, that prevented me from lying down at once\r\nto die. But fourteen days’ stinted allowance of provisions remained, and\r\nit was absolutely necessary to increase the quantity to enable us to\r\nlive five days longer; we therefore partook of it, as pinching necessity\r\ndemanded, and gave ourselves wholly up to the guidance and disposal of\r\nour Creator.\r\n\r\nThe 29th and 30th of January, the wind continued west, and we made\r\nconsiderable progress until the 31st, when it again came ahead, and\r\nprostrated all our hopes. On the 1st of February, it changed again to\r\nthe westward, and on the 2d and 3d blew to the eastward; and we had it\r\nlight and variable until the 8th of February. Our sufferings were now\r\ndrawing to a close; a terrible death appeared shortly to await us;\r\nhunger became violent and outrageous, and we prepared for a speedy\r\nrelease from our troubles; our speech and reason were both considerably\r\nimpaired, and we were reduced to be at this time, certainly the most\r\nhelpless and wretched of the whole human race. Isaac Cole, one of our\r\ncrew, had the day before this, in a fit of despair, thrown himself down\r\nin the boat, and was determined there calmly to wait for death. It was\r\nobvious that he had no chance; all was dark he said in his mind, not a\r\nsingle ray of hope was left for him to dwell upon; and it was folly and\r\nmadness to be struggling against what appeared so palpably to be our\r\nfixed and settled destiny. I remonstrated with him as effectually as the\r\nweakness both of my body and understanding would allow of; and what I\r\nsaid appeared for a moment to have a considerable effect: he made a\r\npowerful and sudden effort, half rose up, crawled forward and hoisted\r\nthe jib, and firmly and loudly cried that he would not give up; that he\r\nwould live as long as the rest of us—but alas! this effort was but the\r\nhectic fever of the moment, and he shortly again relapsed into a state\r\nof melancholy and despair. This day his reason was attacked, and he\r\nbecame about 9 o’clock in the morning a most miserable spectacle of\r\nmadness: he spoke incoherently about every thing, calling loudly for a\r\nnapkin and water, and then lying stupidly and senselessly down in the\r\nboat again, would close his hollow eyes, as if in death. About 10\r\no’clock, we suddenly perceived that he became speechless; we got him as\r\nwell as we were able upon a board, placed on one of the seats of the\r\nboat, and covering him up with some old clothes, left him to his fate.\r\nHe lay in the greatest pain and apparent misery, groaning piteously\r\nuntil four o’clock, when he died, in the most horrid and frightful\r\nconvulsions I ever witnessed. We kept his corpse all night, and in the\r\nmorning my two companions began as of course to make preparations to\r\ndispose of it in the sea; when after reflecting on the subject all\r\nnight, I addressed them on the painful subject of keeping the body for\r\nfood!! Our provisions could not possibly last us beyond three days,\r\nwithin which time, it was not in any degree probable that we should find\r\nrelief from our present sufferings, and that hunger would at last drive\r\nus to the necessity of casting lots. It was without any objection agreed\r\nto, and we set to work as fast as we were able to prepare it so as to\r\nprevent its spoiling. We separated his limbs from his body, and cut all\r\nthe flesh from the bones; after which, we opened the body, took out the\r\nheart, and then closed it again—sewed it up as decently as we could, and\r\ncommitted it to the sea. We now first commenced to satisfy the immediate\r\ncravings of nature from the heart, which we eagerly devoured, and then\r\neat sparingly of a few pieces of the flesh; after which, we hung up the\r\nremainder, cut in thin strips about the boat, to dry in the sun: we made\r\na fire and roasted some of it, to serve us during the next day. In this\r\nmanner did we dispose of our fellow-sufferer; the painful recollection\r\nof which, brings to mind at this moment, some of the most disagreeable\r\nand revolting ideas that it is capable of conceiving. We knew not then,\r\nto whose lot it would fall next, either to die or be shot, and eaten\r\nlike the poor wretch we had just dispatched. Humanity must shudder at\r\nthe dreadful recital. I have no language to paint the anguish of our\r\nsouls in this dreadful dilemma. The next morning, the 10th of February,\r\nwe found that the flesh had become tainted, and had turned of a greenish\r\ncolour, upon which we concluded to make a fire and cook it at once, to\r\nprevent its becoming so putrid as not to be eaten at all: we accordingly\r\ndid so, and by that means preserved it for six or seven days longer; our\r\nbread during the time, remained untouched; as that would not be liable\r\nto spoil, we placed it carefully aside for the last moments of our\r\ntrial. About three o’clock this afternoon a strong breeze set in from\r\nthe NW. and we made very good progress, considering that we were\r\ncompelled to steer the boat by management of the sails alone: this wind\r\ncontinued until the thirteenth, when it changed again ahead. We\r\ncontrived to keep soul and body together by sparingly partaking of our\r\nflesh, cut up in small pieces and eaten with salt water. By the\r\nfourteenth, our bodies became so far recruited, as to enable us to make\r\na few attempts at guiding our boat again with the oar; by each taking\r\nhis turn, we managed to effect it, and to make a tolerable good course.\r\nOn the fifteenth, our flesh was all consumed, and we were driven to the\r\nlast morsel of bread, consisting of two cakes; our limbs had for the\r\nlast two days swelled very much, and now began to pain us most\r\nexcessively. We were still, as near as we could judge, three hundred\r\nmiles from the land, and but three days of our allowance on hand. The\r\nhope of a continuation of the wind, which came out at west this morning,\r\nwas the only comfort and solace that remained to us: so strong had our\r\ndesires at last reached in this respect, that a high fever had set in,\r\nin our veins, and a longing that nothing but its continuation could\r\nsatisfy. Matters were now with us at their height; all hope was cast\r\nupon the breeze; and we tremblingly and fearfully awaited its progress,\r\nand the dreadful development of our destiny. On the sixteenth, at night,\r\nfull of the horrible reflections of our situation, and panting with\r\nweakness, I laid down to sleep, almost indifferent whether I should ever\r\nsee the light again. I had not lain long, before I dreamt I saw a ship\r\nat some distance off from us, and strained every nerve to get to her,\r\nbut could not. I awoke almost overpowered with the frenzy I had caught\r\nin my slumbers, and stung with the cruelties of a diseased and\r\ndisappointed imagination. On the seventeenth, in the afternoon, a heavy\r\ncloud appeared to be settling down in an E. by N. direction from us,\r\nwhich in my view, indicated the vicinity of some land, which I took for\r\nthe island of Massafuera. I concluded it could be no other; and\r\nimmediately upon this reflection, the life blood began to flow again\r\nbriskly in my veins. I told my companions that I was well convinced it\r\nwas land, and if so, in all probability we should reach it before two\r\ndays more. My words appeared to comfort them much; and by repeated\r\nassurances of the favourable appearance of things, their spirits\r\nacquired even a degree of elasticity that was truly astonishing. The\r\ndark features of our distress began now to diminish a little, and the\r\ncountenance, even amid the gloomy bodings of our hard lot, to assume a\r\nmuch fresher hue. We directed our course for the cloud, and our progress\r\nthat night was extremely good. The next morning, before daylight, Thomas\r\nNicholson, a boy about seventeen years of age, one of my two companions\r\nwho had thus far survived with me, after having bailed the boat, laid\r\ndown, drew a piece of canvass over him, and cried out, that he then\r\nwished to die immediately. I saw that he had given up, and I attempted\r\nto speak a few words of comfort and encouragement to him, and\r\nendeavoured to persuade him that it was a great weakness and even\r\nwickedness to abandon a reliance upon the Almighty, while the least\r\nhope, and a breath of life remained; but he felt unwilling to listen to\r\nany of the consolatory suggestions which I made to him; and,\r\nnotwithstanding the extreme probability which I stated there was of our\r\ngaining the land before the end of two days more, he insisted upon lying\r\ndown and giving himself up to despair. A fixed look of settled and\r\nforsaken despondency came over his face: he lay for some time silent,\r\nsullen, and sorrowful—and I felt at once satisfied, that the coldness of\r\ndeath was fast gathering upon him: there was a sudden and unaccountable\r\nearnestness in his manner, that alarmed me, and made me fear that I\r\nmyself might unexpectedly be overtaken by a like weakness, or dizziness\r\nof nature, that would bereave me at once of both reason and life; but\r\nProvidence willed it otherwise.\r\n\r\nAt about seven o’clock this morning, while I was lying asleep, my\r\ncompanion who was steering, suddenly and loudly called out “_There’s a\r\nSail!_” I know not what was the first movement I made upon hearing such\r\nan unexpected cry: the earliest of my recollections are, that\r\nimmediately I stood up, gazing in a state of abstraction and ecstasy\r\nupon the blessed vision of a vessel about seven miles off from us; she\r\nwas standing in the same direction with us, and the only sensation I\r\nfelt at the moment was, that of a violent and unaccountable impulse to\r\nfly directly towards her. I do not believe it is possible to form a just\r\nconception of the pure, strong feelings, and the unmingled emotions of\r\njoy and gratitude, that took possession of my mind on this occasion: the\r\nboy, too, took a sudden and animated start from his despondency, and\r\nstood up to witness the probable instrument of his salvation. Our only\r\nfear was now, that she would not discover us, or that we might not be\r\nable to intercept her course: we, however, put our boat immediately, as\r\nwell as we were able, in a direction to cut her off; and found, to our\r\ngreat joy, that we sailed faster than she did. Upon observing us, she\r\nshortened sail, and allowed us to come up to her. The captain hailed us,\r\nand asked who we were. I told him we were from a wreck, and he cried out\r\nimmediately for us to come alongside the ship. I made an effort to\r\nassist myself along to the side, for the purpose of getting up, but\r\nstrength failed me altogether, and I found it impossible to move a step\r\nfurther without help. We must have formed at that moment, in the eyes of\r\nthe captain and his crew, a most deplorable and affecting picture of\r\nsuffering and misery. Our cadaverous countenances, sunken eyes, and\r\nbones just starting through the skin, with the ragged remnants of\r\nclothes stuck about our sun-burnt bodies, must have produced an\r\nappearance to him affecting and revolting in the highest degree. The\r\nsailors commenced to remove us from our boat, and we were taken to the\r\ncabin, and comfortably provided for in every respect. In a few minutes\r\nwe were permitted to taste of a little thin food, made from tapioca, and\r\nin a few days, with prudent management, we were considerably recruited.\r\nThis vessel proved to be the brig Indian, captain William Crozier, of\r\nLondon; to whom we are indebted for every polite, friendly, and\r\nattentive disposition towards us, that can possibly characterize a man\r\nof humanity and feeling. We were taken up in latitude 33° 45′ S.\r\nlongitude 81° 03′ W. At twelve o’clock this day we saw the island of\r\nMassafuera, and on the 25th of February, we arrived at Valparaiso in\r\nutter distress and poverty. Our wants were promptly relieved there.\r\n\r\nThe captain and the survivers of his boat’s crew, were taken up by the\r\nAmerican whale-ship, the Dauphin, Captain Zimri Coffin, of Nantucket,\r\nand arrived at Valparaiso on the seventeenth of March following: he was\r\ntaken up in latitude 37° S. off the island of St. Mary. The third boat\r\ngot separated from him on the 28th of January, and has not been heard of\r\nsince. The names of all the survivers, are as follows:—Captain George\r\nPollard, junr., Charles Ramsdale, Owen Chase, Benjamin Lawrence, and\r\nThomas Nicholson, all of Nantucket. There died in the captain’s boat,\r\nthe following: Brazilla Ray of Nantucket, Owen Coffin of the same place,\r\nwho was shot, and Samuel Reed, a black.\r\n\r\nThe captain relates, that after being separated, as herein before\r\nstated, they continued to make what progress they could towards the\r\nisland of Juan Fernandez, as was agreed upon; but contrary winds and the\r\nextreme debility of the crew prevailed against their united exertions.\r\nHe was with us equally surprised and concerned at the separation that\r\ntook place between us; but continued on his course, almost confident of\r\nmeeting with us again. On the fourteenth, the whole stock of provisions\r\nbelonging to the second mate’s boat, was entirely exhausted, and on the\r\ntwenty-fifth, the black man, Lawson Thomas, died, and was eaten by his\r\nsurviving companions. On the twenty-first, the captain and his crew were\r\nin the like dreadful situation with respect to their provisions; and on\r\nthe twenty-third, another coloured man, Charles Shorter, died out of the\r\nsame boat, and his body was shared for food between the crews of both\r\nboats. On the twenty-seventh, another, Isaac Shepherd, (a black man,)\r\ndied in the third boat; and on the twenty-eighth, another black, named\r\nSamuel Reed, died out of the captain’s boat. The bodies of these men\r\nconstituted their only food while it lasted; and on the twenty-ninth,\r\nowing to the darkness of the night and want of sufficient power to\r\nmanage their boats, those of the captain and second mate separated in\r\nlatitude 35° S. longitude 100° W. On the 1st of February, having\r\nconsumed the last morsel, the captain and the three other men that\r\nremained with him, were reduced to the necessity of casting lots. It\r\nfell upon Owen Coffin to die, who with great fortitude and resignation\r\nsubmitted to his fate. They drew lots to see who should shoot him: he\r\nplaced himself firmly to receive his death, and was immediately shot by\r\nCharles Ramsdale, whose hard fortune it was to become his executioner.\r\nOn the 11th Brazilla Ray died; and on these two bodies the captain and\r\nCharles Ramsdale, the only two that were then left, subsisted until the\r\nmorning of the twenty-third, when they fell in with the ship Dauphin, as\r\nbefore stated, and were snatched from impending destruction. Every\r\nassistance and attentive humanity, was bestowed upon them by Capt.\r\nCoffin to whom Capt. Pollard acknowledged every grateful obligation.\r\nUpon making known the fact, that three of our companions had been left\r\nat Ducies Island, to the captain of the U. S. frigate Constellation,\r\nwhich lay at Valparaiso when we arrived, he said he should immediately\r\ntake measures to have them taken off.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of June following I arrived at Nantucket in the whale-ship\r\nthe Eagle, Capt. William H. Coffin. My family had received the most\r\ndistressing account of our shipwreck, and had given me up for lost. My\r\nunexpected appearance was welcomed with the most grateful obligations\r\nand acknowledgments to a beneficent Creator, who had guided me through\r\ndarkness, trouble, and death, once more to the bosom of my country and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The following is a list of the whole crew of the ship, with their\r\n  arrangements into the three several boats upon starting from the\r\n  wreck: the names of those who died, were left on the island, or\r\n  shot—with those also who survived, and who were in the third or\r\n  second mate’s boat at the time of separation—and whose fate is yet\r\n  uncertain:—\r\n\r\n         Capt.
