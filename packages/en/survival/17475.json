This paper presents the results of\r\nan investigation by the writer in 1899. All statistics, when not\r\notherwise stated, are for the calendar year 1898.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to so many dealers, fishermen, and others for\r\ninformation given and courtesies extended that it is impossible to\r\nmention them by name; and I now extend to all my most sincere thanks\r\nfor their many kindnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The first steam smack to carry lobsters in a well]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY OF THE LOBSTER.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lobster has been of great value to the New England States\r\nand the British Provinces as a food commodity, but little was known of\r\nits life-history and habits until within the last few years. To this\r\nignorance has been due quite largely peculiar (and in some instances\r\nuseless) laws enacted by some States. The gradual enlightenment of the\r\npublic on this subject has borne good fruit, however, and most of the\r\npresent State laws are founded on substantial facts instead of\r\ntheories. Prof. Francis H. Herrick has been one of the most prominent\r\nof the investigators, and his summary of the present knowledge on this\r\nsubject is quoted below from the Fish Commission Bulletin for 1897:\r\n\r\n\r\n   (1) The fishery is declining, and this decline is due to the\r\n   persistence with which it has been conducted during the last\r\n   twenty-five years. There is no evidence that the animal is\r\n   being driven to the wall by any new or unusual disturbance of\r\n   the forces of nature.\r\n\r\n   (2) The lobster is migratory only to the extent of moving to\r\n   and from the shore, and is, therefore, practically a sedentary\r\n   animal. Its movements are governed chiefly by the abundance of\r\n   food and the temperature of the water.\r\n\r\n   (3) The female may be impregnated or provided with a supply of\r\n   sperm for future use by the male at any time, and the sperm,\r\n   which is deposited in an external pouch or sperm receptacle,\r\n   has remarkable vitality. Copulation occurs commonly in spring,\r\n   and the eggs are fertilized outside the body.\r\n\r\n   (4) Female lobsters become sexually mature when from 8 to 12\r\n   inches long. The majority of all lobsters 10-1/2 inches long\r\n   are mature. It is rare to find a female less than 8 inches long\r\n   which has spawned or one over 12 inches in length which has\r\n   never borne eggs.\r\n\r\n   (5) The spawning interval is a biennial one, two years elapsing\r\n   between each period of egg-laying.\r\n\r\n   (6) The spawning period for the majority of lobsters is July\r\n   and August. A few lay eggs at other seasons of the year--in the\r\n   fall, winter, and probably in the spring.\r\n\r\n   (7) The period of spawning lasts about six weeks, and\r\n   fluctuates slightly from year to year. The individual variation\r\n   in the time of extrusion of ova is explained by the long period\r\n   during which the eggs attain the limits of growth. Anything\r\n   which affects the vital condition of the female during this\r\n   period of two years may affect the time of spawning.\r\n\r\n   (8) The spawning period in the middle and eastern districts of\r\n   Maine is two weeks later than in Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts.\r\n   In 1893 71 per cent of eggs examined from the coast of Maine\r\n   were extruded in the first half of August.\r\n\r\n   (9) The number of eggs laid varies with the size of the animal.\r\n   The law of production may be arithmetically expressed as\r\n   follows: _The number of eggs produced at each reproductive\r\n   period varies in a geometrical series, while the length of\r\n   lobsters producing these eggs varies in an arithmetical\r\n   series._ According to this law an 8-inch lobster produces\r\n   5,000 eggs, a lobster 10 inches long 10,000, a 12-inch lobster\r\n   20,000. This high rate of production is not maintained beyond\r\n   the length of 14 to 16 inches. The largest number of eggs\r\n   recorded for a female is 97,440. A lobster 10-1/2 inches long\r\n   produces, on the average, nearly 13,000 eggs.\r\n\r\n   (10) The period of incubation of summer eggs at Woods Hole is\r\n   about ten months, July 15-August 15 to May 15-June 15. The\r\n   hatching of a single brood lasts about a week, owing to the\r\n   slightly unequal rate of development of individual eggs.\r\n\r\n   (11) The hatching period varies also with the time of\r\n   egg-laying, lobsters having rarely been known to hatch in\r\n   November and February.\r\n\r\n   (12) Taking all things into consideration, the sexes appear\r\n   about equally divided, though the relative numbers caught in\r\n   certain places at certain times of the year may be remarkably\r\n   variable.\r\n\r\n   (13) Molting commonly occurs from June to September, but there\r\n   is no month of the year in which soft lobsters may not be\r\n   caught.\r\n\r\n   (14) The male probably molts oftener than the female.\r\n\r\n   (15) In the adult female the molting like the spawning period\r\n   is a biennial one, but the two periods are one year apart. As a\r\n   rule, the female lays her eggs in July, carries them until the\r\n   following summer, when they hatch; then she molts. Possibly a\r\n   second molt may occur in the fall, winter, or spring, but it is\r\n   not probable, and molting just before the production of new\r\n   eggs is rare.\r\n\r\n   (16) The egg-bearing female, with eggs removed, weighs less\r\n   than the female of the same length without eggs.\r\n\r\n   (17) The new shell becomes thoroughly hard in the course of\r\n   from six to eight weeks, the length of time requisite for this\r\n   varying with the food and other conditions of the animal.\r\n\r\n   (18) The young, after hatching, cut loose from their mother,\r\n   rise to the surface of the ocean, and, lead a free life as\r\n   pelagic larvae. The first larva is about one-third of an inch\r\n   long (7.84 mm). The swimming period lasts from six to eight\r\n   weeks, or until the lobster has molted five or at most six\r\n   times, and is three-fifths of an inch long, when it sinks to\r\n   the bottom. It now travels toward the shore, and, if fortunate,\r\n   establishes itself in the rock piles of inlets of harbors,\r\n   where it remains until driven out by ice in the fall or early\r\n   winter. The smallest, now from 1 to 3 inches long, go down\r\n   among the loose stones which are often exposed at low tides.\r\n   At a later period, when 3 to 4 inches long, they come out of\r\n   their retreats and explore the bottom, occasionally hiding or\r\n   burrowing under stones. Young lobsters have also been found in\r\n   eelgrass and on sandy bottoms in shallow water.\r\n\r\n   (19) The food of the larva consists of minute pelagic\r\n   organisms. The food of the older and adult stages is largely of\r\n   animal origin with but slight addition of vegetable material,\r\n   consisting chiefly of fish and invertebrates of various kinds.\r\n   The large and strong also prey upon the small and weak.\r\n\r\n   (20) The increase in length at each molt is about 15.3 per\r\n   cent. During the first year the lobster molts from 14 to 17\r\n   times. At 10-1/2 inches the lobster has molted 25 to 26 times\r\n   and is about 5 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the purpose of this article is to deal more particularly with the\r\ncommercial side of the lobster question all interested more\r\nparticularly in the natural history of the animal are referred to the\r\nfollowing works:\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the United States,\r\n   sec. I, pp. 780-812.\r\n\r\n   The American Lobster, by Francis H. Herrick. Bull. U. S. Fish\r\n   Com. for 1895, pp. 1-252.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE FISHERY.\r\n\r\nEver since the early Puritan settlers first learned from the Indians\r\nhow to utilize the lobster, it has been one of the most prized\r\narticles of food in the New England States. The early town records of\r\nMassachusetts contain frequent references to this valuable crustacean,\r\nand efforts were made at an early day to conserve the supply.\r\n\r\nAt first, as most settlers lived on or near the coast, each family\r\ncould easily secure its own supply, but as the settlements gradually\r\nextended farther inland this became inconvenient, and it soon became\r\ncustomary for certain persons living on the coast to attend to\r\nsupplying the wants of the inland settlers, and thus the commercial\r\nfishery was established.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Maine is very favorably situated for this fishery. In its\r\neastern and middle sections the shore is bold and rocky, while it is\r\ncut up by large deep inlets and coves which are studded with numerous\r\nislands, large and small, and by bold rocky promontories.  Groups\r\nof islands are also numerous farther off shore, like the Fox and\r\nMatinicus Islands, Deer and Mount Desert islands. Large and small\r\nfresh-water rivers are numerous and the granite bottoms of these\r\nchannels and inlets form admirable breeding grounds. In the western\r\nend the shores are not so rocky, being broken frequently with sandy\r\nreaches, while the rivers are small and comparatively shallow. West of\r\nCasco Bay the islands are infrequent. As a result of this conformation\r\nof coast the best fishing grounds in Maine are between Cape Elizabeth\r\nand Quoddy Head.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1830 smacks from Boston and Connecticut visited Harpswell\r\nfor fresh lobsters, and it is very probable that even before this time\r\nthey had visited the points farther west in the State, as the history\r\nof the fishery, so far as known, shows that it gradually worked to\r\nthe eastward. This was doubtless owing to the fact that the trend of\r\nsettlement in the early part of the century was in that direction. It\r\nis also probable that, for some time before the people along the coast\r\ntook up the fishery, the smackmen themselves did their own fishing.\r\nThis is easily believed when the great abundance is considered. It is\r\nknown that this was done in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nDuring summer the lobsters were very common close in shore and could\r\neasily be gaffed by boys at low water; but this could hardly be called\r\na regular fishery.\r\n\r\nThe regular fishery began with the use of hoop-net pots, which were\r\ngenerally of very rude construction, and the facility with which the\r\nlobsters escaped from them led to their disuse soon after the lath\r\npots began to be introduced. The lath pots were essentially the same\r\nin construction as those now used on the coast of Maine, and each\r\npair of fishermen then handled between 25 and 50.\r\n\r\nUp to about 1865 it was the custom to set the traps singly, and two\r\nmen were usually employed in the fishery, one to haul up, empty the\r\npot, rebait it, and drop it overboard, while the other handled the\r\nboat. In the latter year it was discovered that by setting the pots on\r\ntrawls more pots could be set and only one man would be required to\r\nwork them. This invention, which was claimed by several different\r\npersons, proved quite successful for a while, but after a time, when\r\nthe supply of lobsters began to drop off, better results were secured\r\nby scattering the pots over a greater area and shifting their position\r\neach time they were fished, which was very easily done. As a result of\r\nthis the use of trawls decreased very rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe following facts regarding the early lobster fishery of Maine are\r\nfrom the Fishery Industries of the United States, section v, vol. II,\r\npp. 700, 701:\r\n\r\n\r\n   In 1841 Capt. E. M. Oakes began to carry lobsters from Cundy's\r\n   Harbor and Horse Island Harbor, Harpswell, to Mr. Eben Weeks,\r\n   at East Boston. He was then running a well-smack, named the\r\n   _Swampscott_, of 41 tons, old measurement. The season extended\r\n   from the 1st of March until about the 4th of July, after which\r\n   time the lobsters were supposed to be unfit for eating; the\r\n   black lobsters, or shedders, were even considered poisonous.\r\n   During this season of four months Captain Oakes made ten trips,\r\n   carrying in all 35,000, by count. He continued in this trade\r\n   about six years, taking the combined catch of about five or\r\n   six fishermen. At this same period the smack _Hulda B. Hall_,\r\n   50 tons, of New London, Conn., Captain Chapell, was carrying\r\n   lobsters from Cape Porpoise, Gloucester, Ipswich Bay, and\r\n   occasionally Provincetown, to Boston, making 15 trips in the\r\n   season of four months, and taking about 3,500 lobsters each\r\n   trip. Captain Chapell was supplied with lobsters by four men at\r\n   Cape Porpoise, and by the same number at both Gloucester and\r\n   Ipswich Bay. For four months following the close of the lobster\r\n   season on the Maine coast, or from July 4 until November,\r\n   Captain Chapell ran his smack with lobsters to New York,\r\n   obtaining most of his supplies at Provincetown.\r\n\r\n   In 1847 Captain Oakes purchased the smack _Josephine_, with\r\n   which he began running to Johnson & Young's establishment, at\r\n   Boston, in 1848, buying a portion of his lobsters in the\r\n   Penobscot Bay region, where this fishery had just been started.\r\n   The quantity of lobsters carried by him that year was 40,000.\r\n   The prices paid to the fishermen for smack lobsters was as\r\n   follows: During March, 3 cents each; April, 2-1/2 cents; May\r\n   and June, 2 cents. In 1850, he began to obtain supplies from\r\n   the Muscle Ridges, leaving Harpswell entirely, on account of\r\n   the small size of the lobsters then being caught there. At\r\n   this time the average weight of the lobsters marketed was about\r\n   3 pounds, and all under 10-1/2 inches in length were rejected.\r\n   The traps were made of the same size as at present, but were\r\n   constructed of round oak sticks, and with four hoops or bows\r\n   to support the upper framework. A string of bait, consisting\r\n   mainly of flounders and sculpins, was tied into each trap.\r\n   About 50 traps were used by each fisherman, and they were\r\n   hauled once a day. The warps or buoy lines, by which the traps\r\n   were lowered and hauled, were cut in 12-fathom lengths.\r\n   Lobsters were so abundant at the Muscle Ridges, at this period,\r\n   that four men could fully supply Captain Oakes with lobsters\r\n   every trip. In the course of ten days each man would obtain\r\n   between 1,200 and 1,500 marketable lobsters. In Captain Oakes'\r\n   opinion, the Muscle Ridges have furnished the most extensive\r\n   lobster fishery of the Maine coast. He ran to this locality\r\n   until 1874.\r\n\r\n   Capt. S. S. Davis, of South Saint George, states that about\r\n   1864, when he first began buying lobsters at the Muscle Ridges,\r\n   three men, tending 40 to 50 pots each, caught all the count\r\n   lobsters he could carry to market in his smack. He could load\r\n   5,000 lobsters at a time, and averaged a trip in 7 to 9 days.\r\n   This traffic continued for six or seven years. In 1879, Captain\r\n   Davis bought from 15 men In the same locality, and at times\r\n   was obliged to buy also of others in order to make up a load.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fishery at North Haven began in 1848, but did not increase so\r\nrapidly at first as in sections farther west, as the smacks would only\r\ntake the medium-sized lobsters, fearing that the largest would not\r\nbe able to stand the trip. At Matinicus Island the fishing began in\r\n1868. In 1852 the people on Deer Island began the fishery, and as the\r\nsmackmen made frequent visits the business rapidly increased. The\r\nestablishment of a cannery at Oceanville, about 1860, also caused a\r\nconsiderable development of the fishery. The fishery was started at\r\nIsle an Haute about 1855, and at Swan Island in the early fifties.\r\n\r\nThe canning of lobsters was first carried on at Eastport in 1842, but\r\nthe fishery was not taken up until about 1853, as it was supposed\r\nthere were no lobsters in the neighborhood. The supplies for these\r\ncanneries previous to the inception of the fishery were obtained by\r\nsmacks running to the westward.\r\n\r\nFor some years the fishery was only prosecuted in the late spring,\r\nsummer, and early fall months. Just when winter fishing began in\r\nthe State is doubtful; but according to Capt. Charles Black, of Orr\r\nIsland, it began in that region in 1845 at Harpswell. Previously the\r\nfishermen had the impression that lobsters could not be successfully\r\ncaught earlier than March 20.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1845 the captains of the well-smacks of New\r\nLondon, Conn., who bought most of the lobsters in that vicinity,\r\ninduced Charles E. Clay, Samuel Orr, and a few others to fish during\r\nthe winter, and they set their traps about the same distance from the\r\nshore that the fishermen do at present, and in almost the same depth\r\nof water. The smackmen paid them $4 for 100 lobsters. The next winter\r\nthe fishermen refused to sell by number and wanted $1.25 per 100\r\npounds. The smackmen had no objection to buy them by weight, but\r\nrefused to pay more than $1.12 per 100 pounds. This was accepted, and\r\nfor several years the prices were from $1.12 to $1.25 per 100 pounds.\r\n\r\nComparatively few traps were necessary then, as when the weather would\r\npermit the fishermen to tend their traps they would catch from 20 to\r\n30 lobsters daily, and frequently, when the traps were hauled, they\r\nwould find several lobsters clinging to some part of the pots. The\r\nbait was very plentiful and caught with spears.\r\n\r\nThe lobsters were placed in cars at that time, after having been\r\n\"plugged\" to keep them from injuring each other. The plugs were almost\r\n1-1/2 inches long, flat on one side, round on the other, and with a\r\nsharp point. Plugging has since been discontinued, as the trifling\r\ninjury the lobsters did each other was nothing compared to the value\r\nof cans of meat spoiled by one of these pine plugs being boiled with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The steam smack _Mina and Lizzie_ landing her cargo at\r\nPortland]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fleet of lobster boats in harbor at York Island]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FISHING-GROUNDS.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the comparative value of the grounds\r\nin the State, owing to the movements of the lobsters. In the early\r\nspring, in April or May, as the waters in the bays and rivers warm up,\r\nthe lobsters come into the comparatively shallow waters. They remain\r\nhere until late in the fall, going back to the ocean or deep waters\r\nof the bays in either October or November. They love to congregate on\r\nrocky bottom, and pots set on such bottom will frequently make large\r\ncatches, while those on sandy or muddy ground will catch almost\r\nnothing. In the early years of the fishery they came in very close in\r\ngreat numbers, and could frequently be taken at low water in dip nets\r\nor by gaffs; but they are now found in summer in depths of from 3\r\nto 15 fathoms in the numerous passages between the islands and the\r\nmainland, and the lower reaches of the bays and rivers. For a number\r\nof years winter fishing was not prosecuted, but now it is a very\r\nimportant business. In winter the pots are generally set in the ocean\r\nat depths of from 15 to 50 fathoms.\r\n\r\nAs the greatest part of the coast line is cut up by numerous bays and\r\nrivers, and these are dotted with large and small islands, they form\r\nadmirable breeding grounds for the lobster. Some of the best locations\r\nare in Little Machias, Machias, Englishman, Pleasant Point, Chandler,\r\nNarragaugus, Muscongus, Linekin, Sheepscot, and Casco bays, while the\r\nfishing is especially good around the numerous islands in the lower\r\nPenobscot and Blue Hill bays, and at Monhegan and the Matinicus\r\nislands in the ocean. The Sheepscot River is also a favorite resort\r\nfor lobsters during the warm months, while in the winter they retire\r\nto the waters of the bay, where the fishing can be carried on very\r\neasily. At most of the other grounds the winter fishing is carried on\r\nin the ocean, as the lobsters do not usually remain in the bays. Most\r\nof the fishing in Casco Bay is carried on at the eastern end among the\r\nnumerous islands. The earliest fishing of which we have any definite\r\nrecord was carried on from the township of Harpswell on this bay. This\r\nregion has held its own remarkably well, as in 1898 more than twice as\r\nmany lobsters were taken by fishermen from this township than from any\r\nother town in the State.\r\n\r\nThe upper portions of Frenchman, Blue Hill, and Penobscot bays were\r\nformerly very important grounds, but are now almost exhausted. These\r\nregions were especially noted for large lobsters. In August, 1891, Mr.\r\nF. W. Collins, a Rockland dealer, had 50 lobsters in his establishment\r\nwhich weighed from 10 to 18-1/2 pounds apiece. About half of these\r\ncame from Castine, in upper Penobscot Bay, and the remainder from Blue\r\nHill Falls, in the upper Blue Hill Bay.\r\n\r\nThe grounds in York County, at the western end of the State, were\r\nformerly quite prolific, but the excessive fishing of the last thirty\r\nyears has very badly depleted them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FISHING SEASON.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the fishery it was customary to fish only during\r\nthe spring and fall. When the canneries went into operation they\r\nusually worked during the spring, early summer, and fall, and as they\r\nfurnished a ready market for all the lobsters that could be caught\r\nthis came to be the principal season. At that time it was not thought\r\npossible to do any winter fishing, owing to the cold and stormy\r\nweather and the fact that the fishing had to be carried on generally\r\nin the open sea.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 a law was passed limiting the canning season to the period\r\nbetween April 1 and August 1. This season was frequently changed\r\nby subsequent enactments, but rarely covered a longer period than\r\nthat fixed in the first law. As at certain places on the coast the\r\ncanneries were the only market for lobsters the fishery would cease\r\nas soon as the canneries stopped. At other places, which were visited\r\nby the smacks, some of the fishermen would continue fishing after the\r\ncanneries closed, selling to the smackmen. At various times a closed\r\nseason was in force, but at present there is no limitation as to\r\nseason. The canning industry in the State practically ceased to\r\nexist in 1895, and since then the whole catch has had to be marketed\r\nin a live or boiled condition. The smack fleet had been gradually\r\nincreasing as the live-lobster trade extended, and by the time the\r\ncanneries closed permanently they had extended their visits to every\r\npoint where lobsters could be had in any number.\r\n\r\nAt present the majority of the fishermen usually haul out their\r\ntraps during July and August and put them in good order for the fall\r\nfishing. During the excessively cold portion of the winter most of the\r\npots are taken out, but some fishing is done during every month of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen on Monhegan Island, about 12 miles southeast of Pemaquid\r\nPoint, agree among themselves to put no lobster pots in the water\r\nuntil about the 1st of January. There is then no restriction on\r\nfishing until about May 15, when all pots are hauled out and no more\r\nfishing is done until the season begins again. During this season the\r\nlaw in regard to short lobsters is rigidly enforced by the fishermen\r\nthemselves. Should any outsider visit this island during the close\r\ntime established by the fishermen, and attempt to fish, he is quietly\r\ninformed of the agreement and requested to conform to it. Should\r\nhe persist in working after this warning, his pots are apt to\r\nmysteriously disappear. As lobsters bring a much higher price in\r\nwinter than in summer, the Monhegan fishermen reap a rich reward, as\r\nthe lobsters are very numerous, owing to the 7-1/2 months close time.\r\nOn the first day the fishermen hauled in 1900 one man secured 293,\r\nfor which he received 19 cents apiece. The smallest number secured by\r\nanyone was 135.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHING APPLIANCES.\r\n\r\nIn most large fisheries for certain species numerous changes occur at\r\nintervals in the apparatus used, owing to changed conditions, etc.,\r\nbut in the lobster industry changes have been few, and at an early\r\nperiod the fishermen fixed upon a uniform apparatus, which has been in\r\nuse ever since with but slight modifications, and these generally only\r\ntemporary.\r\n\r\nThe earliest form of apparatus used to any considerable extent was the\r\nhoop net. This consisted generally of a hoop or ring of about 1/2-inch\r\nround iron, or a wooden hogshead hoop, from 2-1/2 to 3 feet or more in\r\ndiameter. To this hoop was attached a net bag with a depth of 18 to 24\r\ninches as a bottom, while two wooden half hoops were bent above it,\r\ncrossing at right angles in the center about 12 or 15 inches above the\r\nplane of the hoop. Sometimes these half hoops were replaced by short\r\ncords. The bait was suspended from the point of crossing of the two\r\nwooden hoops and the line for raising and lowering the pots was\r\nattached at the same place. As there was no way of closing the\r\nmouth of the pot after a lobster had entered, these nets had to\r\nbe constantly watched, the lobster being in the habit of retiring\r\nafter he had finished his repast. In using these the fisherman would\r\ngenerally go out in the evening and at short intervals he would haul\r\nin his nets and remove whatever lobsters they might contain. The\r\nconstant attention necessary in attending to these hoop nets led the\r\nfishermen to devise an apparatus which would hold the lobsters after\r\nonce entering and would require only occasional visits, and \"lath\r\npots\" were found to fulfill all requirements. They acquire the name\r\nfrom the use of common laths in their construction. They are usually\r\nabout 4 feet in length, with a width of about 2 feet, a height of 18\r\ninches, and in Maine are usually of semicylindrical form.\r\n\r\nThe following description of this apparatus is from the Fishery\r\nIndustries of the United States, sec. v, vol. 11, p. 666:\r\n\r\n\r\n   The framework of the bottom consists of three strips of wood,\r\n   either hemlock, spruce, or pine (the first mentioned being the\r\n   most durable), a little longer than the width of the pot, about\r\n   2-3/4 inches wide and 1 inch thick. In the ends of each of\r\n   the outer strips a hole is bored to receive the ends of a\r\n   small branch of pliable wood, which is bent into a regular\r\n   semicircular curve. These hoops are made of branches of spruce\r\n   or hemlock, or of hardwood saplings, such as maple, birch,\r\n   or ash, generally retaining the bark. Three of these similar\r\n   frames, straight below and curved above, constitute the\r\n   framework of each pot, one to stand at each end and one in the\r\n   center. The narrow strips of wood, generally ordinary house\r\n   laths of spruce or pine, which form the covering, are nailed\r\n   lengthwise to them, with interspaces between about equal to\r\n   the width of the lathe. On the bottom the laths are sometimes\r\n   nailed on the outside and sometimes on the inside of the cross\r\n   pieces. The door is formed by three or four of the laths\r\n   running the entire length near the top. The door is hinged on\r\n   by means of small leather strips, and is fastened by a single\r\n   wooden button in the center, or by two buttons, one at each\r\n   end. The openings into the pot . . . are two in number, one at\r\n   each end, are generally knit of coarse twine and have a mesh\r\n   between three-fourths of an inch and 1 inch square. They are\r\n   funnel-shaped, with one side shorter than the other, and at the\r\n   larger end have the same diameter as the framework. The smaller\r\n   and inner end measures about 6 inches in diameter and is held\r\n   open by means of a wire ring or wooden hoop. The funnels are\r\n   fastened by the larger ends to the end frames of the pot, with\r\n   the shorter side uppermost, so that when they are in place they\r\n   lead obliquely upward into the pot instead of horizontally.\r\n   The inner ends are secured in position by one or two cords\r\n   extending to the center frame. The funnels are about 11 or 12\r\n   inches deep, and therefore extend about halfway to the center\r\n   of the pot. They taper rapidly and form a strongly inclined\r\n   plane, up which the lobsters must climb in their search for the\r\n   bait. A two-strand manila twine is most commonly used for the\r\n   funnels. Cotton is also used, but is more expensive and less\r\n   durable.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lobster pots]\r\n\r\n\r\nA change in the shape of the funnel was first made at Matinicus\r\nshortly before 1890. This has been called the \"patent head.\" Large\r\nlobsters are said to always go to the top and small ones to the bottom\r\nof the pots. By going to the top in the \"old-head\" pot large lobsters\r\nmade their escape through the hole, but in the pots with \"patent\r\nheads\" instead of finding their way through the hole the big lobsters\r\nslide over it. The \"patent head\" has not been used to any extent,\r\nhowever. The sketch shown on the following page gives a good idea of\r\nthe difference in shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old style of head (in general use) and \"patent\" head]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the center of the ordinary pot is a sort of spearhead of wood or\r\niron from 8 to 12 inches long. This has one large barb and is set\r\nupright in the middle of the center frame. The bait is placed on this\r\nspearhead. Several large stones or bricks are lashed to the bottom of\r\nthe pot, on the inside, in order to furnish weight enough to hold the\r\npot at the bottom.\r\n\r\nAs it was noticed that a lobster generally crawled over a pot before\r\nentering by the end, some pots of a square form and with the opening\r\nat the top were constructed, but they were not successful.\r\n\r\nAnother variation had a length of 7-1/2 feet and five supporting\r\nframes inside instead of three, as in the old pot. These were set at\r\nequal distances apart, and had two more funnels than the other, one\r\nfunnel being attached to each of the frames except the center one,\r\nand all pointing inward. In order to reach the bait the lobster had\r\nto pass through two funnels, and its chances of escape were thereby\r\nlessened. This style is rarely seen now.\r\n\r\nStill another variety in vogue for a short time had a trapdoor, on\r\nwhich the lobster had to climb in order to reach the bait; the door\r\nthen gave way and precipitated the lobster into a secure inclosure.\r\n\r\nA few pots are made with a funnel of laths in place of the net\r\nfunnels. They are the same as the ordinary pot in every other\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary pots cost about $1 to construct.\r\n\r\nDuring certain seasons the pots are badly eaten by \"worms,\" the\r\nshipworm (Teredo) or one of the species of small boring crustaceans.\r\nPots are also frequently lost during stormy weather, and the fishermen\r\ntherefore have a reserve stock on hand in order to replace those lost\r\nor temporarily disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF FISHING.\r\n\r\nIn fishing the traps are either set on single warps or on trawls of\r\n8 to 40 and 50 pots. At first all pots were set singly. The line by\r\nwhich they were lowered and hauled up, and which also served as a buoy\r\nline, was fastened to one of the end frames of the bottom or sill, as\r\nit is called, at the intersection of the hoop. The buoys generally\r\nconsist of a tapering piece of cedar or spruce, wedge-shaped, or\r\nnearly spindle shaped, and about 18 inches long. They are usually\r\npainted in distinctive colors, so that each fisherman may easily\r\nrecognize his own. Small kegs are also used as buoys.\r\n\r\nIn the warm season the pots are frequently set on trawls or \"ground\r\nlines,\" as lobsters are quite thick then on the rocky bottom near\r\nshore. If the bottom is sandy they are set farther from shore.\r\nLobsters are most numerous on a rocky bottom. In the trawl method the\r\npots are usually set about 30 feet apart, depending on the depth of\r\nwater, so that when one pot is in the boat the next will be on the\r\nbottom. The ground lines have large anchors at each end and a floating\r\nbuoy tied to a strong line, which is fastened to the ground line\r\nalmost 25 fathoms from the anchors. When the last pot is hauled the\r\nanchor is far enough away to hold the boat in position. The pots are\r\nset at distances from the shore ranging from 100 yards to 5 or 6\r\nmiles. This method of setting pots was first used about the year 1865\r\nin Sagadahoc County. The traps are set in from 3 to 10 fathoms in the\r\nwarm season.\r\n\r\nIn winter fishing the pots are generally set singly, as the lobsters\r\nare more scattered then and the best results are attained by shifting\r\nthe position of the pots slightly each time they are fished. This is\r\ncaused by the drift of the boat while the fisherman is hauling in the\r\npot, emptying and rebaiting it, and then dropping it overboard again.\r\nThe winter fishing is generally carried on in the open sea, although\r\nin a few places, like Sheepscot Bay, the lobsters in winter retire to\r\nthe deep waters of the bays and can there be caught. The pots are\r\ngenerally set in from 20 to 50 fathoms of water at this season.\r\n\r\nCertain fishermen claim that when pots are set on a trawl placed\r\nacross the tide the catch is greater than when the trawl is set in\r\nthe direction of the current. In the former case, it is asserted, the\r\nscent or fine particles coming from the bait is more widely diffused\r\nand more apt to attract the lobsters. In entering, after first\r\nreconnoitering around and over the pot, the lobster always backs in,\r\nprimarily that he may be prepared to meet any foe following him, also\r\nbecause his large claws would be apt to catch in the net funnel should\r\nhe enter head first. After discovering that he is imprisoned, which\r\nhe does very speedily, he seems to lose all desire for the bait, and\r\nspends his time roaming around the pot hunting for a means of escape.\r\n\r\nThe pots are generally hauled once a day, but sometimes twice a day in\r\ngood weather. As the tide along the Maine coast is quite strong, the\r\nfishermen usually haul their pots at or about slack water, low tide\r\ngenerally being preferred when they are worked once a day. The number\r\nused by a fisherman varies greatly on different sections of the coast.\r\nAccording to the investigations of this Commission, the average\r\nnumber of pots to the man in certain years was as follows: Fifty-six\r\npots in 1880, 59 in 1887 and 1888, 58 in 1889 and 1892, and 50 in\r\n1898. This average, however, is somewhat misleading, as quite a number\r\nof persons along the coast take up lobstering for only a few months\r\nin the year, and then return to their regular occupations. As these\r\npersons use but few pots, the average per man throughout the whole\r\nState is very considerably reduced. The regular lobster fishermen have\r\nbeen steadily increasing the number of their pots for several years\r\npast. They have found this an absolute necessity in order to catch as\r\nmany lobsters now as they caught twenty or thirty years ago. It is not\r\nunusual now to find one of the regular fishermen handling as high as\r\n100 pots, and sometimes even 125, when a few years ago 25 and 50 pots\r\nwas a large number. This does not take into account his reserve stock\r\nof pots, which it is necessary to have on hand in order to replace\r\nthose damaged or lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fishermen operating their pots]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAIT.\r\n\r\nCod, hake, and halibut heads are quite generally used as bait. Halibut\r\nheads are said to be the best, as they are tougher than the cod or\r\nhake heads, and thus last much longer. Sculpins, flounders, in fact\r\nalmost any kind of fish, can be used. In the vicinity of sardine\r\ncanneries the heads of herring are used. Sometimes the bait is\r\nslightly salted, at other times it is used fresh. Small herring are\r\nlightly salted, and then allowed to remain until partly decayed, when\r\nthey are inclosed in small bags, and these put into the pots. The\r\noil from this bait forms a \"slick\" in the water, and when the smell\r\nfrom it is strong the fishermen consider it at its best. The bait is\r\ngenerally secured by small haul-seines and spears in sections where\r\noffal can not be bought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHING VESSELS AND BOATS.\r\n\r\nThe fishing vessels are either sloop or schooner rigged, with an\r\naverage net tonnage of slightly over 8 tons (new measurement) and an\r\naverage value of about $475. There has been a great increase in the\r\nnumber of these vessels during recent years. Eight vessels were used\r\nin 1880,  29 in 1889, and 130 in 1898. Quite a number of these vessels\r\nare used in other fisheries during their seasons. Two men usually form\r\na crew, although three, and sometimes four, are occasionally used.\r\n\r\nThe other vessels comprise sailboats under 5 tons and rowboats.\r\nThe sailboats are generally small square-sterned sloops, open in\r\nthe afterpart, but with a cuddy forward. They are all built with\r\ncenterboards, and some are lapstreak while others are \"set work.\"\r\nAround the afterpart of the standing room is a seat, the ballast is\r\nfloored over, and two little bunks and a stove generally help to\r\nfurnish the cuddy. They vary in length from 16 to 26 feet and in width\r\nfrom 6 to 9 feet; they average about 2 tons. They are especially\r\nadapted to the winter fishery, as they are good sailers and ride out\r\nthe storms easily.\r\n\r\nDories are in quite general use in the lobster fishery, as are also\r\nthe double-enders, or peapods. This latter is a small canoe-shaped\r\nboat of an average length of 15-1/2 feet, 4-1/2 feet breadth, and\r\n1-1/2 feet depth. They are mainly built lapstreak, but a few are \"set\r\nwork.\" Both ends are exactly alike; the sides are rounded and the\r\nbottom is flat, being, however, only 4 or 5 inches wide in the center\r\nand tapering toward each end, at the same time bending slightly\r\nupward, so as to make the boat shallower at the ends than in the\r\nmiddle. This kind of bottom is called a \"rocker bottom.\" They are\r\nusually rowed, but are sometimes furnished with a sprit sail and\r\ncenterboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTING VESSELS OR SMACKS.\r\n\r\nEven before the lobster fishery had been taken up to any extent, the\r\ncoast of Maine was visited by well-smacks from Connecticut and New\r\nYork, most of which had been engaged in the transportation of live\r\nfish before engaging in the carrying of lobsters. These vessels\r\nsometimes carried pots, and caught their own lobsters; but as this\r\nmethod was not very convenient, the people living along the coast\r\ntook up the fishery, and sold the lobsters to the smackmen. About\r\n1860 the canneries began to absorb a considerable part of the catch,\r\nand they employed vessels to ply along the coast and buy lobsters.\r\nAs these vessels would only be out a few days at a time, wells were\r\nnot necessary, and the lobsters were packed in the hold. In the\r\nsummer great numbers of them were killed by the heat in the hold.\r\nAfter 1885 the canneries rapidly dropped out of the business, the last\r\none closing in 1895. In 1853 there were but 6 smacks, 4 of them from\r\nNew London, Conn. In 1880 there were 58, of which 21 were dry smacks,\r\nwhile in 1898 there were 76, of which 17 were steamers and launches\r\nand 59 sailing vessels. These were all well-smacks. A few sailing\r\nsmacks also engaged in other fishery pursuits during the dull summer\r\nmonths. In 1879 a steamer which had no well was used to run lobsters\r\nto the cannery at Castine. The first steamer fitted with a well to\r\nengage in the business was the _Grace Morgan_, owned by Mr. F. W.\r\nCollins, a lobster dealer of Rockland, who describes the steamer as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   The steam and well smack _Grace Morgan_ was built in 1890, by\r\n   Robert Palmer & Son, of Noank, Conn. At that time she was a dry\r\n   boat, but the following year, 1891, the Palmers built a small well\r\n   in her as an experiment, but I am of the opinion that it did not\r\n   prove very satisfactory or profitable; consequently they offered\r\n   her for sale and wrote to me in relation to buying her. I went\r\n   to Noank and looked her over and came to the conclusion that by\r\n   enlarging the well and making other needed changes she could\r\n   be made not only a good boat to carry lobsters alive, but also\r\n   to do it profitably; consequently I bought her and brought\r\n   her to Rockland, had the well enlarged on ideas of my own, and\r\n   differently constructed, so as to give it better circulation of\r\n   water, and also made other needed improvements throughout the boat\r\n   to adapt her especially for carrying lobsters alive. The changes I\r\n   made in her proved so successful in keeping lobsters alive, while\r\n   it increased the capacity for carrying, that I have since adapted\r\n   the same principles on all my boats. The well I had put into the\r\n   _Grace Morgan_ is what is termed a \"box well,\" that is, without\r\n   any well deck. The well is built from the sides of the steamer\r\n   directly to the hatch on the main deck, with bulkheads forward and\r\n   aft and tops running directly to the deck. . . . You will see at\r\n   once that this well has many advantages over the old style with\r\n   flat well decks, like those of sailing vessels: (1) It affords a\r\n   much larger carrying capacity in same space of vessel. (2) The\r\n   priming-out pieces are much higher up on sides of vessel, giving\r\n   more room for boring hull, which affords much better circulation\r\n   of water in well, which is a great advantage in keeping lobsters\r\n   alive while on long trips. (3) Every lobster can be easily bailed\r\n   out of the well without grounding the vessel, which is necessary\r\n   with all vessels having the old-style well. (4) In all steam\r\n   and well smacks the after part of the ship is always steadiest,\r\n   consequently the well being located aft, as in my smacks, the\r\n   lobsters contained in them are not subjected to the hard pounding\r\n   while running in seaway that they are in the old-style wells,\r\n   where there is no chance to relieve themselves other than to be\r\n   forced against the well decks by the upward force of the water\r\n   when the vessel settles into the sea, and which results in killing\r\n   many of them.\r\n\r\n   Both of my steamers have box wells aft, and from my experience,\r\n   compared with all other steam and well smacks afloat, I am\r\n   convinced that this well, for all practical purposes, is the best\r\n   that has yet been adapted to steam smacks. So far as the _Grace\r\n   Morgan_ is concerned, she has been a perfect success in carrying\r\n   her lobsters in all kinds of weather since I put her into\r\n   commission October 27, 1892, during which time she has had a\r\n   wonderful career, as well as carrying millions of lobsters.\r\n   Probably no boat of her size has ever had such an experience,\r\n   as she has run steadily the year around in all kinds of weather\r\n   during the past eight years. . . . Previous to buying the _Grace\r\n   Morgan_ I had run steamers in the lobster business, but they had\r\n   no well, and being so hot in their holds, particularly in the\r\n   summer months, the lobsters died so fast that the business in dry\r\n   steamers could not be made profitable. This is what prompted me to\r\n   construct a well in mine, as I have done.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Grace Morgan_ has a length of 49 feet, a breadth of 13.9 feet,\r\nand a depth of 5.7 feet, a gross tonnage of 21 tons, and a net\r\ntonnage of 10 tons.\r\n\r\nThe steam smacks now used average about 14 tons. They are usually\r\nbuilt low in the water, and have a small pilot-house forward, with an\r\nopen space between it and the engine-house, and living quarters aft.\r\nThe boat has also one or two short masts. Some of them also have the\r\npilot-house and engine-house joined together. In those with a space\r\nbetween the pilot-house and engine-house the well is usually placed in\r\nthis open space. Where the pilot-house and engine-house are together\r\nthe well is either located forward or aft. These wells are generally\r\ncapable of bolding from 3,000 to 10,000 live lobsters.  Small holes in\r\nthe bottom of the well keep it filled with fresh sea water. Should the\r\nweather be clear the proportion of dead and injured lobsters will be\r\nsmall, but in bad weather many are apt to be killed by the pitching\r\nand rolling to which they are subjected.\r\n\r\nThese smacks make regular trips up and down the coast, landing their\r\ncargoes either at Rockland, Portland, or at one of the lobster pounds\r\nscattered along the coast. They not only stop at the villages, but\r\nalso drop anchor off the little camps of the lobstermen, and should\r\nthe smacks of two rival dealers arrive at a place simultaneously,\r\nwhich frequently happens, the bidding between the captains for the\r\nfishermen's catch gladdens the latter's heart and greatly enriches his\r\npocketbook. Most of the captains have regular places of call where\r\nthey know the fishermen are holding their lobsters for them, and they\r\nfollow a rude sort of schedule, which will not often vary more than\r\na day or two. The lobsters are bought of the fishermen by count,\r\nand cash is paid for them. Should the smack belong to a dealer this\r\npractically ends the financial side of the transaction so far as the\r\ncaptain is concerned, as the crew are paid wages. Should the smack\r\nbelong to a person other than the dealer, which is frequently the\r\ncase, he either makes an agreement with some dealer to run for him\r\nexclusively at a certain price or commission, or else buys from the\r\nfishermen and then sells at either Rockland or Portland. This method\r\nof buying lobsters is somewhat hazardous, as the market price\r\nsometimes changes sharply when the smack is out of reach of\r\ntelegraphic communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBSTER CARS.\r\n\r\nLobsters must be marketed in a live or boiled condition; and as\r\nfishermen can get better prices for them alive than boiled, each\r\nfisherman generally has a live-car in which to hold them until they\r\ncan be sold. These cars are usually oblong, rectangular boxes, with\r\nopen seams or numerous small holes to permit the free circulation of\r\nthe water. They are of various sizes, according to the needs of the\r\nfisherman, a good average being about 6 feet long by 4 feet wide and\r\nabout 2 feet deep. The door is placed on the top. They are usually\r\nmoored close to the shore during the fishing season, the rest of the\r\ntime being hauled up on the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fishermen's lobster cars]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dealers cars are very similar to those used by the fishermen, only\r\nmuch larger. They generally average about 30 feet in length, 12 feet\r\nin width; and 3 feet in depth, with capacity for from 2,000 to 3,000\r\nlobsters. The inner part of this car is usually divided off into\r\nfive transverse compartments by means of a framework inside. Each\r\ncompartment is provided with two large doors entering from the top,\r\none door on each side of the middle line of the car. These cars cost\r\nthe dealers about $70 each. The life of one of these cars is about\r\nfive or six years, although at the end of about three years it is\r\ngenerally necessary to replace the sides of the car on account of the\r\nravages of a dock worm which is quite abundant along the Maine coast.\r\nWhen new the top of the car is usually about a foot above the water,\r\nbut as it gets water-soaked it sinks down until it is even with the\r\nwater, and some of the older cars have to be buoyed up with kegs\r\nat each end, placed inside, to prevent them from sinking below the\r\nsurface. These cars are moored alongside the docks of the dealers at\r\nPortland and Rockland and other points.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lobster cars used in the wholesale trade at Portland]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. J. R. Burns, of Friendship, has invented and patented a new\r\nstyle of car. The inside is divided into a series of compartments by\r\nhorizontal and vertical partitions of slats, wire netting, or any\r\nmaterial which will permit the free circulation of the water. Each\r\ncompartment has a chute extending down into it from the top, by means\r\nof which the lobsters can be put in and their food given them. There\r\nare also conveniently arranged openings, with doors, through which the\r\nlobsters may be removed when desired. These cars usually average about\r\n35 feet in length, 18 feet in width, and 6 feet in depth, and have a\r\ncapacity for about 5,000 lobsters each. They are in use at Rockland,\r\nFriendship, Tremont, and Jonesport. They prevent the lobsters from\r\nhuddling together and thus killing each other by their own weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF SHIPPING, WHOLESALE TRADE, ETC.\r\n\r\nAs lobsters can not be shipped or preserved in a frozen state they\r\nmust be shipped either alive or boiled. About nine-tenths of the\r\nlobsters caught in Maine waters are shipped in the live state. The\r\nprincipal shipping centers are Portland, Rockland, and Eastport,\r\nwhich have good railroad and steamship facilities with points outside\r\nof the State. Those shipped from the latter point are mainly from the\r\nBritish Provinces, the fishermen near Eastport bringing them in in\r\ntheir own boats. A number also come in from the Provinces on the\r\nregular steamship lines. The other places get their supply from the\r\nsmacks and also from the fishermen in their vicinity, who run in their\r\nown catch. Portland is very favorably situated in this regard, as\r\nCasco Bay is a noted fishing center for lobsters.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a smack arrives it is moored directly alongside one of\r\nthe cars. The lobsters are then dipped out of the well by means of\r\nlong-handled scoop nets and thrown on the deck of the vessel. The\r\ndoors of the car are then opened, and men on the vessel pick over the\r\nlobsters lying on the deck and toss them two by two into the different\r\ncompartments, those dead and badly mutilated being thrown to one side\r\nfor the time being. All vigorous lobsters above a certain size are\r\nplaced in compartments of the car by themselves, while the weak and\r\nsmall are put in separate compartments. The dead lobsters and those\r\nwhich have had their shells broken or have been so injured that they\r\nare very sure to die are either thrown overboard or on the dump. A\r\nlobster which has lost one or even both claws is not thrown away, as\r\nsuch an injury would have very little effect on its health.\r\n\r\nWhen an order is received for live lobsters, those which have been\r\nlongest in the cars are usually shipped. Flour barrels holding about\r\n140 pounds or sugar barrels holding about 185 pounds, with small holes\r\nbored in the bottoms for drainage, are used for the shipment. Formerly\r\nthe lobsters were packed close together in the barrel, and a large\r\npiece of ice was put in at the top, but this was found to kill a\r\nnumber of them. The present method is to split off about one-third of\r\na 100-pound cake of ice the long way, and place it upright about half\r\nway of the length of the barrel, the lobsters then being packed snugly\r\non all sides of the ice. In handling them the packer seizes the\r\nlobster by the carapace with his right hand, bends the tail up under\r\nthe body with his left hand, and quickly deposits it in the barrel.\r\nThe packer usually has his right hand covered with a woolen mitt or\r\nwrapped in a long piece of linen, for protection from the claws of the\r\nlobster.\r\n\r\nWhen the barrel is nearly full the lobsters are covered with a little\r\nseaweed or large-leaved marine plants, and the rest of the space is\r\nfilled with cracked ice. The top is then covered with a piece of\r\nsacking, which is secured under the upper hoop of the barrel. Packed\r\nin this way, lobsters have easily survived a trip as far west as St.\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\nOwing to the high prices realized in England for live lobsters,\r\nattempts have been made to ship live American lobsters to that market,\r\ngenerally from Canadian ports. In 1877 Messrs. John Marston & Sons, of\r\nPortland, made a trial shipment of 250. They were placed in a large\r\ntank 20 feet long by 8 feet wide and 3 feet deep, and constantly\r\nsupplied with fresh seawater through six faucets by means of a donkey\r\nengine, a waste-pipe preventing any overflow. The trip was fairly\r\nsuccessful, as only 50 died, and the balance brought from 60 to 75\r\ncents per pound.\r\n\r\nThe smacks and dealers buy lobsters by count, as the fishermen\r\ngenerally have no facilities for weighing them; but the dealers always\r\nsell by weight. The mortality among the lobsters from the time they\r\nare put aboard the smacks until they are barreled for shipment is\r\nestimated at about 5 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILING.\r\n\r\nLive lobsters are much preferred by the trade throughout the country,\r\nand only those that can not be marketed in such condition are boiled.\r\nThe number boiled fluctuates considerably, owing to the condition\r\nof the markets. When the fresh markets of Boston and New York are\r\noverstocked, the lobster dealers of Rockland and Portland, where most\r\nof the Maine lobsters are boiled, proceed to boil their surplus stock.\r\n\r\nThe following description of the boiling is from The Fisheries and\r\nFishery Industries of the United States, section v, vol. II, p. 684:\r\n\r\n\r\n   The boilers are rectangular wooden tanks or vats of about 60\r\n   gallons capacity, lined with zinc and furnished with a cover.\r\n   Heat is applied by the introduction of steam through a series of\r\n   perforated pipes arranged in the bottom of the tank. The steam\r\n   is generated in an ordinary boiler standing close at hand. The\r\n   lobsters are not thrown directly into the vat, as the operation\r\n   of removing them after cooking would in such an event be an\r\n   exceedingly tedious one; but an iron framework basket, of rather\r\n   slender bars is made to fit the tank loosely, and is lowered and\r\n   raised by means of a small derrick placed over the tank. This\r\n   frame, which holds about 300 pounds, is filled with lobsters at\r\n   the edge of the wharf from the floating cars, and is then carried\r\n   to the tank and lowered into it after the water it contains has\r\n   reached the desired temperature, that of boiling. The water is\r\n   first supplied to the tank, which is filled to about one-third or\r\n   two-thirds its capacity, about a peck of salt is added, and then\r\n   the steam is turned on. The same water suffices for several\r\n   successive boilings, about 2 quarts of salt being added each time.\r\n   The lobsters are allowed to remain in about half an hour, or until\r\n   the proper red color indicates they are sufficiently cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boiling live lobsters preparatory to shipping on ice,\r\nshowing boiler, steam tank, cage, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter cooling, they are packed in barrels for shipment, just as live\r\nlobsters are. When well iced they will keep a week or longer. Only\r\nlive lobsters are boiled, as the meat of those which die prior to\r\nboiling deteriorates rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen and small dealers use various kinds of boilers, from an\r\nordinary washboiler to a smaller form of the regular boiler used by\r\nthe large dealers. The product prepared by these people is generally\r\npicked from the shell and sold locally in that condition. This opens\r\na way for the fisherman to evade the 10-1/2 inch limit law. They\r\nfrequently take lobsters under the minimum legal size and, after\r\nboiling them, pick the flesh. It is then impossible for anybody to\r\ntell what sized lobster the meat had come from. Quite a local trade\r\nin the picking of lobsters has been established in a number of small\r\ncoast towns, the meat generally being sold in the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the extent of the wholesale lobster trade in\r\nRockland and Portland during 1898, including everything connected with\r\nthe business except the smacks and pounds, which are shown elsewhere.\r\nThere are a few other dealers scattered along the coast, but most of\r\nthe business is concentrated at these cities. An idea of the extent\r\nof the increase in the lobster trade of Portland can be gained when\r\nit is stated that in 1880 about 1,900,000 pounds of lobsters, valued\r\nat $70,000, were handled here, while 6,145,821 pounds, valued at\r\n$611,955, were handled in 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Extent of the wholesale lobster trade of Rockland and Portland\r\n   in 1898.\r\n\r\n                           Rockland    Portland\r\n                           --------    --------\r\n   Value of property,\r\n   capital, and wages\r\n      Property, etc         $14,338     $44,770\r\n      Cars                      850       6,800\r\n      Cash Capital           22,000     110,500\r\n      Wages                   4,676      18,198\r\n\r\n   Number of persons engaged\r\n      Firms                       2          10*\r\n      Proprietors                 3          13\r\n      Clerks                      2           2\r\n      Other Employees             7          31\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Rockland               Portland\r\n   Lobsters bought        --------------         ---------------\r\n   and sold               No.      Value         No.       Value\r\n   ---------------        ---      -----         ---       -----\r\n      Bought, No.       692,188              4,097,214\r\n      Bought, lbs.    1,038,282   $89,984    6,145,821   $611,955\r\n      Sold,   lbs.      795,934    91,532    5,308,027    690,045\r\n      Sold,   lbs.      347,815    26,705      515,518     82,483\r\n\r\n   *Several of these firms also handle other fishery products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBSTER POUNDS\r\n\r\nFor a number of years the catch of lobsters was sold by the fishermen\r\nto the dealers and by the latter to the trade as rapidly as possible.\r\nIn doing this the markets would be flooded at certain times, when the\r\nprice would drop to a very low figure, while at other times they would\r\nbe very scarce, which would enhance the price materially. The dealers\r\nwere the first to see the necessity for devising some method by which\r\nlobsters could be secured when they were plentiful and cheap and\r\nretained in captivity until they became scarce and high in price:\r\nInclosures of various kinds had for some years been in use in the\r\nfisheries in various parts of the country for the purpose of keeping\r\ncertain species alive until the time came to utilize them. In 1875\r\nJohnson & Young, of Boston, established an inclosure or pound near\r\nVinal Haven, on one of the Fox Islands. A cove covering about 500\r\nacres, with an average depth of about 90 feet, was selected. A section\r\nof about 9 acres, separated from the main portion of the cove by a\r\nnatural shoal and with a bottom of soft grayish mud, was selected for\r\nthe pound. In order to make it proof against the efforts of the\r\nlobsters to escape and as a protection from enemies without, a wire\r\nfence was built over the shoal part. This section had a depth of from\r\n15 to 60 feet, and a capacity of about 300,000, although there were\r\nrarely that many in the pound at one time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Inclosure for live lobsters at Vinal Haven, Maine]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lobsters are bought from smacks and from fishermen in the vicinity\r\nduring the height of the fishing season, when the price is low, and\r\nare retained in the pound until the price becomes high, which is\r\ngenerally during the winter season. They are fed with fish offal,\r\nwhich can usually be bought at Vinal Haven for $1 per barrel.\r\n\r\nOily fish are not fed to them, as it is said that the lobsters\r\ndecrease in weight on such a diet. Experience has shown that the\r\nquantity of food required depends largely on the temperature of the\r\nwater, as lobsters do not eat as freely when the water is cold as\r\nin water of a higher temperature. When wanted for shipment they are\r\nusually secured by means of pots, seines, or beam trawls.\r\n\r\nEven with such a successful example before them, other dealers were\r\nchary about going into the business, and in 1890 there were only three\r\npounds in the whole State. They increased more rapidly after that,\r\nhowever, and in 1898 there were nine pounds in the State, with a total\r\nvaluation of $18,700. These were located at Dyer Bay, Sunset, Vinal\r\nHaven, Long Island, South Bristol, Pemaquid Beach, Southport, and\r\nHouse Island, in Portland Harbor. It is very probable that there will\r\nbe a greater increase in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANNING INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nMaine is the only State in the Union in which lobsters have been\r\ncanned. The following account of the inception and early history of\r\nthe industry, taken from \"The Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the\r\nUnited States,\" is very complete:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Lobster canning was first attempted in the United States at\r\n   Eastport, Me., shortly after 1840, and was made successful in\r\n   1843, the methods finally employed having been borrowed from\r\n   Scotland, which country is said to have learned the process from\r\n   France. For the successful introduction of the process into the\r\n   United States we are indebted to Mr. Charles Mitchell, now of\r\n   Charlestown, Mass., a practical canner of Scotland, who had\r\n   learned his trade of John Moir & Son, of Aberdeen, the first\r\n   Scotch firm, it is claimed, to put up hermetically sealed\r\n   preparations of meat, game, and salmon, their enterprise dating\r\n   back to 1824. Mr. U. S. Treat, a native of Maine, appears,\r\n   however, to have been most active and influential in starting the\r\n   enterprise and in introducing canned goods into the markets of the\r\n   United States. Mr. Treat was, at an early period, engaged in the\r\n   preparation of smoked salmon on the Penobscot River, and in 1839\r\n   removed to Calais, Me., where he continued in the same business.\r\n   About 1840 he associated with him a Mr. Noble, of Calais, and a\r\n   Mr. Holliday, a native of Scotland, who had also been employed in\r\n   the salmon fisheries of the Penobscot River, under the firm name\r\n   of Treat, Noble & Holliday. This firm moved to Eastport in 1842,\r\n   for the purpose of starting the manufacture of hermetically sealed\r\n   goods, and began experiments with lobsters, salmon, and haddock.\r\n   Their capital was limited, their appliances crude, and many\r\n   discouraging difficulties were encountered. The quality of the\r\n   cans furnished them was poor, causing them often to burst while\r\n   in the bath, and the proper methods of bathing and of expelling\r\n   the air from the cans were not understood. The experiments were\r\n   continued for two years with varying success, and in secret, no\r\n   outsiders being allowed to enter their bathing room. Though fairly\r\n   successful in some of their results, they could not always depend\r\n   upon their goods keeping well.\r\n\r\n   In 1843 they secured the services of Mr. Charles Mitchell, who was\r\n   then residing at Halifax, and who was not only well acquainted\r\n   with the methods of bathing practiced in his own country, but was\r\n   also a practical tinsmith. He had been employed in the canning of\r\n   hermetically sealed goods in Scotland for ten years, and came over\r\n   to Halifax in 1841, where he continued for two years in the same\r\n   occupation, exporting his goods to England. After Mr. Mitchell's\r\n   arrival at Eastport, no further difficulty was experienced in the\r\n   bathing or other preparation of the lobsters, and a desirable\r\n   grade of goods was put up, but they found no sale, as canned\r\n   preparations were comparatively unknown in the markets of the\r\n   United States. Mr. Treat visited each of the larger cities with\r\n   samples of the goods, and endeavored to establish agencies for\r\n   them, but he was generally obliged to send on consignment, as few\r\n   firms were willing to take the responsibility of buying on their\r\n   own account. A patent was also applied for, but the claim was not\r\n   pressed and the patent was never received.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success at Eastport led to a rapid extension of the business in\r\nother parts of the State. The second cannery was located at Harpswell\r\nabout the year 1849. A cannery was started at Carver Harbor, Fox\r\nIslands, in 1851, and another at Southwest Harbor in 1853. In 1857\r\na cannery was started at North Haven, and at Gouldsboro two were\r\nstarted in 1863 and 1870, respectively. From this time the number\r\nincreased rapidly for several years. After 1880 the number operated\r\nfluctuated considerably, depending on the abundance of lobsters.\r\nSome canneries had to suspend operations at an early stage, owing to\r\nthe exhaustion of the grounds in their vicinity. At most canneries\r\nlobsters formed only a part of the pack, sardines, clams, fish, and\r\nvarious vegetables and fruits being packed in their season. Most of\r\nthe canneries were built and operated by Boston and Portland firms.\r\n\r\nAt first the lobsters used for canning ranged in weight from 3 to 10\r\npounds. Gradually the average weight was reduced, until at last it\r\nreached as low as 3/4 pound, or even less. This was caused principally\r\nby the high prices paid for large lobsters for the fresh trade, with\r\nwhich the canneries could not compete.\r\n\r\nAs the supply of lobsters on the Maine coast began to decrease shortly\r\nbefore 1870, while the demand for canned lobsters increased at an\r\nenormous rate, the dealers began to establish canneries on the coasts\r\nof the British provinces. As the decline in the supply was attributed\r\nto the canneries, a sentiment against them was gradually formed, and\r\nlaws were enacted regulating the time in which they could operate and\r\nthe size of the lobsters they could put up. Prior to 1879 they were\r\npermitted to pack lobsters at any season of the year, but they usually\r\noperated only between April 1 and August 1, and again between the 10th\r\nor middle of September and the 1st of December, the length of the\r\nseason depending very largely upon the weather and the abundance of\r\nlobsters. In 1879 it was enacted that no canning of lobsters should\r\nbe allowed from August 1 to April 1 following. In 1883 it was made\r\nillegal to can lobsters less than 9 inches in length. In 1885 the\r\ncanning season was fixed from April 1 to July 15. In 1889 the season\r\nwas fixed from May 1 to July 1, and the minimum length of lobsters to\r\nbe canned placed at 9 inches. In 1891 this act was so amended as to\r\nmake the season from April 20 to June 1.  After 1880 the number of\r\ncanneries gradually declined, until in 1895 the last one suspended the\r\ncanning, of lobsters, owing to the passage of a law fixing the minimum\r\nsize at 10-1/2 inches. This law went into effect July 1, 1895. As they\r\ncould not afford to pay the high price demanded for this size they\r\nwere compelled to give up the business.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the number of factories in operation, the\r\nquantity and value of fresh lobsters used, and the number and value of\r\ncans of lobsters put up, in the years 1880, 1889, and 1892:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         1880                1889                1892\r\n                     -------------       -------------      --------------\r\n                     No.     Value       No.     Value       No.     Value\r\n                     ---     -----       ---     -----       ---     -----\r\nNumber of\r\n   canneries            23                  20                  11\r\nLobsters used,\r\n   fresh   lbs.  9,494,284  $95,000  5,752,654  $72,092  9,494,284  $95,000\r\n\r\n\r\nCanned\r\n   One-lb cans   1,542,696             999,521  126,577  1,228,944  195,114\r\n   Two-lb cans     148,704              85,520   16,036      3,096      839\r\n   Other sizes     139,801\r\n                 ---------  -------  ---------  -------  ---------  -------\r\n   Total cans    1,831,201  238,280  1,085,041  142,613  1,232,040  195,953\r\n\r\n   Part of the lobsters used in the Eastport factories come from New\r\n   Brunswick. It is impossible to separate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABUNDANCE, ETC.\r\n\r\nThere are no accurate figures showing the catch of lobsters in Maine\r\nprevious to 1880. It is therefore difficult to make comparisons, and\r\none is compelled to depend largely upon the memory of the fishermen\r\nand the statements of the canners and dealers, which the lapse of\r\ntime, etc., makes rather unreliable. The numerous petitions sent\r\nto the legislature asking for restrictive laws, while possibly\r\nexaggerated at times, indicate that there were fears of the exhaustion\r\nof the fishery for some years back. It is positively known, however,\r\nthat certain grounds have been almost or totally exhausted through\r\noverfishing for a number of years, while on other grounds the supply\r\nof lobsters has seriously decreased. There was a time when no lobster\r\nunder 2 pounds in weight was saved by the fishermen. In later years,\r\nbefore there was a restriction fixing the minimum size of lobsters\r\nthat could be canned, the canneries frequently used half-pound\r\nlobsters. The fixing of the minimum length of the lobsters caught at\r\n10-1/2 inches, and the consequent closing up of the canneries, has\r\nbeen of incalculable benefit to the fishermen, as the young lobsters\r\nnow have an opportunity to reach maturity.\r\n\r\nThe table given below shows for certain years the number of pots used,\r\nthe quantity of lobsters taken, with their value, also the average\r\ncatch and value per man, the average catch per pot, and the average\r\nprice per pound:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           Average Average Average Average\r\n                             Catch          catch   stock   catch   price\r\n      Fisher-           ----------------     per     per     per     per\r\nYear    men    Pots     Pounds     Value     man     man     pot    pound\r\n----    ---    ----     ------     -----     ---     ---     ---    -----\r\n                                            pounds         pounds   cents\r\n\r\n1880  1,843  104,456  14,234,182  $268,739   7,723  $146     136     1.9\r\n1887  1,906  113,299  22,916,642   512,044  12,023   269     202     2.2\r\n1888  1,967  112,632  21,694,731   515,880  11,029   267     193     2.4\r\n1889  2,080  121,140  25,001,351   574,165  12,020   276     206     2.3\r\n1892  2,628  153,043  17,642,677   663,043   6,713   252     117     3.8\r\n1898  3,099  155,978  11,183,294   992,855   3,609   320      78     8.9\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the catch increased up to 1889 and then decreased until in\r\n1898 it was lower than in 1880, the number of fisherman and pots and\r\nthe value of the catch steadily increased. The average stock per\r\nman fluctuated somewhat from year to year, but in 1898 shows a\r\nconsiderable increase over every other year. The most interesting\r\npoint however, is the average price per pound. In 1880 this was 1.9\r\ncents, while in 1898 it was 8.9 cents per pound. With one exception,\r\neach year shows a progressive increase in value per pound. The great\r\nincrease of 1898 over 1892, 5.1 cents per pound, was caused by the\r\nclosing up of the canneries in 1895, and the consequent dropping out\r\nof the cheap product they had been buying from the fishermen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF LOBSTERS.\r\n\r\nThe figures given below show the average weight of lobsters at certain\r\ngiven lengths. These weights are made up from the results obtained by\r\ninvestigators of the United States Fish Commission, particularly those\r\nof Prof. Francis H. Herrick.

Atwater, of Middletown,\r\nConnecticut, made a series of careful analyses of the composition of\r\nthe flesh of three lobsters from the coasts of Maine and\r\nMassachusetts, and the figures given below represent the results:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Per cent.\r\n                                                     ---------\r\n\r\n   Proportions of edible portion and shell:\r\n\r\n      Total edible portion                             39.77\r\n      Shell                                            57.47\r\n      Loss in cleaning                                  2.76\r\n\r\n   Proportions of water and dry substance\r\n   in edible portion:\r\n\r\n      Water                                            82.73\r\n      Dry substance                                    17.27\r\n\r\n   Chemical analysis calculated on dry substance:\r\n\r\n      Nitrogen                                         12.54\r\n      Albuminoids (nitrogen x 6.25)                    78.37\r\n      Fat                                              11.43\r\n      Crude ash                                        10.06\r\n      Phosphorus (calculated as P2 O6)                  2.24\r\n      Sulfur (calculated as SO3)                        2.47\r\n      Chlorine                                          3.46\r\n\r\n   Chemical analysis calculated on\r\n   fresh substance in flesh:\r\n\r\n      Water                                            82.73\r\n      Nitrogen                                          2.17\r\n      Albuminoids (nitrogen x 6.25)                    13.57\r\n      Fat                                               1.97\r\n      Crude ash                                         1.74\r\n      Phosphorus (calculated as P2 06)                   .39\r\n      Sulphur (calculated as SO3)                        .43\r\n      Chlorine                                           .59\r\n\r\n   Nutritive value of flesh of lobsters\r\n   compared with beef as a standard and\r\n   reckoned at 100.                                    61.97\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL PROPAGATION OF THE LOBSTER.\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase in the catch of this crustacean during the past ten\r\nyears has drawn upon it the most earnest attention of all interested\r\nin the preservation of this valuable fishery. If the \"berried\" or\r\nfemale lobster bearing eggs, and the young and immature, were let\r\nalone by the fishermen there would be no necessity for a resort to\r\nartificial lobster culture. Maine has a most stringent law forbidding\r\nthe taking and selling of \"berried\" lobsters, and of any lobster under\r\n10-1/2 inches in length, but this law is evaded by numerous fishermen\r\nwhenever possible. An idea of the extent to which short lobsters are\r\nmarketed in the State may be gathered from the statement of Mr. A. R.\r\nNickerson, commissioner of sea and shore fisheries for the State,\r\nthat in 1899 over 50,000 short lobsters were seized and liberated by\r\nthe State wardens. As these wardens only discover a small proportion\r\nof the short lobsters handled by the fishermen and dealers it is\r\neasy to see what a terrible drain this is on the future hope of the\r\nfishery--the young and immature. Large numbers of \"berried\" lobsters\r\nare also captured, the eggs brushed off, and the lobsters sold as\r\nordinary female lobsters.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the U. S. Fish Commission for 1897, on pages 235 and\r\n236, contains the following account of the artificial propagation of\r\nlobsters:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Prior to 1885 experiments had been conducted at various points\r\n   looking to the artificial propagation  of the lobster. The only\r\n   practical attempts of this nature previous to those made by the\r\n   Fish Commission were by means of \"parking,\" that is, holding in\r\n   large naturally inclosed basins lobsters that had been injured,\r\n   soft-shelled ones, and those below marketable size. Occasionally\r\n   females with spawn were placed in the same inclosures. One of\r\n   these parks was established in Massachusetts in 1872, but was\r\n   afterwards abandoned; another was established on the coast of\r\n   Maine about 1875. It was soon demonstrated, however, that the\r\n   results from inclosures of this character, so far as the rearing\r\n   of the lobsters from the young were concerned, would not be\r\n   sufficient to materially affect the general supply. The completion\r\n   of the new marine laboratory and hatchery at Woods Hole in 1885,\r\n   with its complete system of salt-water circulation, permitted the\r\n   commencement of experiments in artificial hatching on a large\r\n   scale which had not been practicable theretofore, although small\r\n   quantities of lobster eggs, as well as those of other crustaceans,\r\n   had been successfully hatched. In 1886 the experiments had\r\n   progressed so successfully that several million eggs were\r\n   collected and hatched at Woods Hole, the fry being deposited in\r\n   Vineyard Sound and adjacent waters. From 1887 to 1890, inclusive,\r\n   the number of eggs collected was 17,821,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the above years the average production of fry was about 54\r\nper cent.  By the use of more improved apparatus the average was\r\nbrought up to 90 per cent in 1897, when the collections amounted\r\nto 150,000,000 eggs, of which 135,000,000 were hatched. As the\r\ncommissioner of sea and shore fisheries of Maine objected to the\r\ntaking of female lobsters in that State and the planting of part, at\r\nleast, of the resulting fry in other waters, an arrangement was made\r\nin 1898 by which all female lobsters and the fry hatched out from the\r\neggs secured from these would be returned to the State waters. Under\r\nthis arrangement 2,365 \"berried\" lobsters were bought from the Maine\r\nfishermen by the U. S. Fish Commission. From these 25,207,000 eggs\r\nwere taken and 22,875,000 fry were hatched. Of these, 21,500,000 were\r\ndeposited in Maine waters at various points. In 1899, 36,925,000 fry\r\nwere planted in Maine waters by the Commission. In order that the\r\nfemale lobsters may be secured the authorities of Maine permit the\r\nfishermen to catch and sell \"berried\" lobsters to the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe collection of eggs in Maine is usually made by the Commission\r\nduring the months of April, May, June, and to about the middle of\r\nJuly, depending upon the supply to be had. During the season of 1899 a\r\nsmall steam smack was chartered for collecting the lobsters, starting\r\nfrom Gloucester, where the hatching of Maine lobster eggs is now\r\ncarried on, and running to Eastport, returning over the same route.\r\nThe Fish Commission schooner _Grampus_ was also used in this work.\r\nThe lobsters are purchased from fishermen, who receive the market\r\nprice for ordinary lobsters, and as they are not allowed to sell\r\nthese lobsters legally for consumption the sale to the Commission\r\nmaterially increases their financial returns.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 a radical advance along the line of artificial propagation\r\nwas made, so far as the legislature was concerned, when the act\r\nincorporating the Samoset Island Association, of Boothbay, was passed.\r\nSection 4 of the charter reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   In order to secure a sufficient and regular supply of lobsters for\r\n   domestic consumption on any land or islands under the control of\r\n   said corporation, it may increase the number of lobsters within\r\n   said limits by artificial propagation, or other appropriate acts\r\n   and methods, under the direction of the fishery commission, and\r\n   shall not be interfered with by other parties, but be protected\r\n   therein, as said fishery commission may determine, and shall have\r\n   the right, by its agents and tenants, to take and catch lobsters\r\n   within 300 yards of the low-water line of the islands and lands\r\n   owned or leased by said corporation, during each and every month,\r\n   for domestic use.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the legislature passed an act granting R. T. Carver the sole\r\nright to propagate lobsters in Carver's pond, Vinalhaven. Mr. Carver's\r\nexperiment was a failure, as he says the mud in the pond was so filthy\r\nthat nearly all the spawn was killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE AND PECULIAR LOBSTERS.\r\n\r\nSince the inception of the fishery, stories of the capture of lobsters\r\nweighing 30, 40, and even 50 pounds have been common, but have rarely\r\nbeen well authenticated. Especially is this the case in the early\r\nyears of the fishery. It is probable that in the transmission of the\r\nstories from person to person the lobsters gained rather than lost in\r\nsize. Among the most authentic cases in Maine are the following:\r\n\r\nOn May 6, 1891, a male lobster weighing slightly over 23 pounds\r\nwas taken in Penobscot Bay, southeast of Moose Point, in line with\r\nBrigadier Island, in about 3-1/2 fathoms of water, by Mr. John Condon.\r\nThe lobster had tried to back into the trap, but after getting\r\nhis tail through the funnel he was unable to get either in or out and\r\nwas thus captured.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. F. W. Collins, a dealer of Rockland, in August,\r\n1891, a lobster weighing 18-1/2 pounds was taken at Blue Hill Falls,\r\nin upper Blue Hill Bay, while in November, 1892, a female lobster\r\nweighing 18 pounds was taken at Green Island.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1893, Mr. N. F. Trefethen, of Portland, received a lobster\r\nfrom Vinal Haven which weighed 18 pounds.\r\n\r\nAccording to R. F. Crie & Sons, of Criehaven, on September 7,1898, a\r\nmale lobster weighing 25 pounds and measuring 25 inches from the end\r\nof the nose to the tip of tail, and 45 inches including the claws, was\r\ncaught on a hake trawl by Peter Mitchell, a fisherman. The trawl was\r\nset about 2 miles southeast from Matinicus Rock Light Station in 60\r\nfathoms of water.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1899, the writer saw a live male lobster at Peak Island\r\nwhich measured 44 inches in length and weighed 25 pounds, according to\r\nthe statement of the owner. It had been caught near Monhegan Island,\r\nand the owner was carrying it from town to town in a small car, which\r\nhe had built for it, and charging a small fee to look at it.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1874, a female lobster weighing about 2 pounds was caught\r\noff Hurricane Island. Her color was a rich indigo along the middle of\r\nthe upper part of the body, shading off into a brighter and clearer\r\ntint on the sides and extremities. The upper surface of the large\r\nclaws was blue and purple, faintly mottled with darker shades, while\r\nunderneath was a delicate cream tint. The under parts of the body\r\ntended also to melt into a light cream color, and this was also true\r\nof the spines and tubercles of the shell and appendages.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 a Peak Island fisherman caught a lobster about 11 inches\r\nin length whose back was of an indigo blue, and which toward the\r\nextremities and under parts was shaded off into a pure white. The\r\nunder part of the claw was also of a pure white.\r\n\r\nMr. Lewis McDonald, of Portland, has a pure white lobster preserved in\r\nalcohol. It was caught in 1887.\r\n\r\nA lobster was caught at Beal Island, near West Jonesport, which was\r\nabout 6 or 7 inches in length and almost jet black.\r\n\r\nA few bright-red lobsters, looking as though they had been boiled,\r\nhave also been taken along the coast at various times.\r\n\r\nA lobster was caught near Long Island, Casco Bay, about the year 1886,\r\nin which half of the body was light-yellow up to the middle line of\r\nthe back, while the other half was bright-red. There were no spots on\r\nthe shell.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1898, Mr. R. T. Carver, of Vinal Haven, had in his\r\npossession a female lobster, about 11 inches long, of a bright-red\r\ncolor all over, except the forward half of the right side of the\r\ncarapace and the feeler on this side, which were of the usual color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS REGULATING THE FISHERY.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the legislature revised and consolidated the laws relating to\r\nthe sea and shore fisheries of Maine, and below are given the sections\r\nrelating to the lobster fishery adopted that year, together with the\r\namendments to the act adopted in 1899, which are incorporated\r\nherewith:\r\n\r\n\r\n   SEC. 39. It is unlawful to catch, buy or sell, or expose for sale,\r\n   or possess for any purpose, any lobsters less than 10-1/2 inches\r\n   in length, alive or dead, cooked or uncooked, measured in manner\r\n   as follows: Taking the length of the back of the lobster, measured\r\n   from the bone of the nose to the end of the bone of the middle of\r\n   the flipper of the tail, the length to be taken in a gauge with a\r\n   cleat upon each end of the same, measuring 10-1/2 inches between\r\n   said cleats, with the lobster laid upon its back and extended upon\r\n   its back upon the gauge, without stretching or pulling, to the end\r\n   of the bone of the middle flipper of the tail, its natural length,\r\n   and any lobster shorter than the prescribed length when caught,\r\n   shall be liberated alive at the risk and cost of the parties\r\n   taking them, under a penalty of $1 for each lobster so caught,\r\n   bought, sold, exposed for sale, or in the possession not so\r\n   liberated. The possession of mutilated, uncooked lobsters shall be\r\n   prima facie evidence that they are not of the required length.\r\n\r\n   SEC. 40. It is unlawful to destroy, buy, sell, expose for sale, or\r\n   possess any female lobsters in spawn or with eggs attached at any\r\n   season of the year, under a penalty of $10 for each lobster so\r\n   destroyed, caught, bought, sold, exposed for sale, or possessed:\r\n   _Provided, however_, If it appears that it was intended to\r\n   liberate them in accordance with the provisions of this act, the\r\n   persons having such lobsters in possession shall not be liable\r\n   to any of the penalties herein provided for, though he may have\r\n   failed, for any cause not within his control, to so liberate them.\r\n\r\n   SEC. 41. It shall be unlawful to can, preserve, or pickle lobsters\r\n   less than 10-1/2 inches in length, alive or dead, measured as\r\n   aforesaid; and for every lobster canned, preserved, or pickled\r\n   contrary to the provisions of this section every person, firm,\r\n   association, or corporation so canning, preserving, or pickling\r\n   shall be liable to a penalty of $1 for every lobster so canned,\r\n   preserved, or pickled contrary to the provisions of this section,\r\n   and a further penalty of $300 for every day on which such unlawful\r\n   canning, preserving, or pickling is carried on.\r\n\r\n   SEC. 42. All barrels, boxes, or other packages in transit\r\n   containing lobsters shall be marked with the word lobsters in\r\n   capital letters, at least 1 inch in length, together with the full\r\n   name of the shipper. Said marking shall be placed in a plain and\r\n   legible manner on the outside of such barrel, boxes, or other\r\n   packages; and in case of seizure by any duly authorized officer\r\n   of any barrels, boxes, or other packages in transit, containing\r\n   lobsters, which are not so marked, or in case of seizure by such\r\n   officer of barrels, boxes, or other packages in transit containing\r\n   lobsters less than the prescribed length, such lobsters as are\r\n   alive and less than the prescribed length shall be liberated and\r\n   all such lobsters as are of the prescribed length found in such\r\n   barrels, boxes, or packages, together with such barrels, boxes,\r\n   and packages, shall be forfeited and disposed of under the\r\n   provisions of section 47 of this act.\r\n\r\n   SEC. 43. Every person, firm, association, or corporation who ships\r\n   lobsters without having the barrels, boxes, or other packages in\r\n   which the same are contained marked as prescribed in the previous\r\n   section shall upon conviction be punished by a fine of $25, and\r\n   upon subsequent conviction thereof by a fine of $50; and any\r\n   person or corporation in the business of a common carrier of\r\n   merchandise who shall carry or transport from place to place\r\n   lobsters in barrels, boxes, or other packages not so marked shall\r\n   be liable to a penalty of $50 upon such conviction thereof.\r\n\r\n   SEC. 44. All cars in which lobsters are kept, and all lobster cars\r\n   while in the water, shall have the name of the owner or owners\r\n   thereof on the top of the car, where it may plainly be seen, in\r\n   letters not less than three-fourths of an inch in length, plainly\r\n   carved or branded thereon, and all traps, cars, or other devices\r\n   for the catching of lobsters shall have, while in the water, the\r\n   owner's name carved or branded in like manner on all the buoys\r\n   attached to said traps or other devices, under a penalty of $10\r\n   for each car and $5 for each trap or device not so marked; and if\r\n   sufficient proof to establish the ownership of such cars or traps\r\n   can not be readily obtained, they may be declared forfeited,\r\n   subject to the provisions of section 47 of this act.\r\n\r\n   SEC. 45. All persons are hereby prohibited from setting any\r\n   lobster traps within 300 feet of the mouth or outer end of the\r\n   leaders of any fish weir, under a penalty of $10 for each offense.\r\n\r\n   SEC. 46. Whoever takes up, or attempts to take up, or in any way\r\n   knowingly and willfully interferes with any lobster trap while set\r\n   for use, without the authority of the owner thereof, shall be\r\n   punished by a fine of not less than $20, nor more than $50;\r\n   _Provided, however_, That no action, complaint, or indictment\r\n   shall be maintained under this section unless the name of the\r\n   owner of all such traps shall be carved or branded in legible\r\n   letters, not less than three-fourths of an inch in length, on all\r\n   the buoys connected with such traps.\r\n\r\n   SEC. 47. When any lobsters are seized by virtue of the provisions\r\n   of this act, it shall be the duty of the officer making such\r\n   seizure to cause such lobsters, so seized, as he is not required\r\n   by law to liberate, together with the cars, traps, barrels, boxes,\r\n   or other packages in which they are contained, to be appraised\r\n   within 24 hours after the time of such seizures by three\r\n   disinterested men residing in the county where such seizure\r\n   is made, to be selected by him, and the lobsters, cars, traps,\r\n   barrels, boxes, or other packages so seized and appraised shall\r\n   thereupon be sold by the officer making the seizure thereof, at\r\n   such time and in such manner as shall by him be deemed proper. The\r\n   officer making such seizure and sale shall within ten days after\r\n   the time of such seizure file a libel in behalf of the State\r\n   before a trial justice, or a judge of a police or municipal court\r\n   of the county in which such seizure was made, setting forth the\r\n   fact of such seizure, appraisal, and sale, the time and place of\r\n   the seizure, the number of lobsters, cars, traps, barrels, boxes,\r\n   or other packages so seized and sold, and the amount of the\r\n   proceeds of such sale; and such trial justice or judge shall\r\n   appoint a time and place for the hearing of such libel, and shall\r\n   issue a notice of the same to all persons interested to appear at\r\n   the time and place appointed, and show cause why the lobsters,\r\n   cars, traps, barrels, boxes, or other packages so seized and sold,\r\n   and the proceeds of such sale, should not be declared forfeited,\r\n   which notice shall be served upon the owner, if known, and by\r\n   causing an attested copy of such libel and notice to be posted in\r\n   two public and conspicuous places in the town in which the seizure\r\n   was made, seven days at least before the time of hearing.\r\n\r\n   If any person appears at the time and place of hearing, and claims\r\n   that the lobsters, cars, traps, barrels, boxes, or other packages\r\n   so seized and sold were not liable to forfeiture at the time of\r\n   seizure, and that he was entitled thereto, the trial justice or\r\n   judge shall hear and determine the cause, and if he shall decide\r\n   that such lobsters, cars, traps, barrels, boxes, or other\r\n   packages, at the time of seizure, were not liable to forfeiture,\r\n   and that the claimant was entitled thereto, he shall order the\r\n   proceeds of such sale to be paid to the claimant; if no claimant\r\n   shall appear, or if such trial justice or judge shall decide that\r\n   such lobsters, traps, cars, barrels, boxes, or other packages, at\r\n   the time of the seizure, were liable to forfeiture, or that the\r\n   claimant was not entitled thereto, he shall decree a forfeiture of\r\n   such lobsters, cars, traps, barrels, boxes, or other packages, and\r\n   of the proceeds of sale, and shall order the proceeds of sale,\r\n   after deducting all lawful charges, to be paid to the county\r\n   treasurer, and by him to the State treasurer, to be used as\r\n   directed in section 48 of this act, and shall render judgment\r\n   against the claimant for costs to be taxed as in civil suits, and\r\n   issue execution therefor against him in favor of the State, which\r\n   costs, when collected, shall be paid in to the treasurer of the\r\n   county, and by him to the treasurer of the State, to be added and\r\n   made a part of the appropriation for sea and shore fisheries.\r\n   The claimant shall have the right of appeal to the next supreme\r\n   judicial court or superior court in the county, upon recognizing\r\n   and paying the fees for copies and entry as in cases of appeal\r\n   in criminal cases. The fees and costs of seizure, appraisal,\r\n   and sale, and in all other proceedings in the case, shall be as\r\n   provided by law in criminal cases, and in case a forfeiture shall\r\n   be declared, shall be paid out of the proceeds of the sale,\r\n   otherwise shall be paid by the county, as in criminal cases.\r\n\r\n   SEC. 48. All fines and penalties under this act may be recovered\r\n   by complaint, indictment, or action of debt brought in the\r\n   county where the offense is committed. The action of debt shall\r\n   be brought in the name of the commissioner of sea and shore\r\n   fisheries, and all offenses under or violations of the provisions\r\n   of this statute may be settled by the commissioner of sea and\r\n   shore fisheries, upon such terms and conditions as he deems\r\n   advisable. All fines, penalties, and collections under this act\r\n   shall be paid into the treasury of the county where the offense\r\n   is committed, and by such treasurer to the State treasurer, to be\r\n   added to and made a part of the appropriation for sea and shore\r\n   fisheries.\r\n\r\n   SEC. 49. The commissioner of sea and shore fisheries may take fish\r\n   of any kind, when, where, and in such manner as he chooses, for\r\n   the purposes of science, of cultivation, and of dissemination, and\r\n   he may grant written permits to other persons to take fish for the\r\n   same purposes, and may introduce or permit to be introduced any\r\n   kind of fish into any waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following special act was passed at the 1899 session of the\r\nlegislature:\r\n\r\n\r\n   SEC. 1. No person shall take, catch, kill, or destroy any lobsters\r\n   between the 1st day of July and the 1st day of September in each\r\n   year, under a penalty of $1 for each lobster so taken, caught,\r\n   killed, or destroyed, in the waters of Pigeon Hill Bay, so called,\r\n   in the towns of Millbridge and Steuben, within the following\r\n   points, namely: Commencing at Woods Pond Point, on the west side\r\n   of Pigeon Hill Bay; thence easterly to the Nubble, on Little Bois\r\n   Bubert Island; thence by the shore to the head of Bois Bubert\r\n   Island; thence northerly to Joe Dyers Point, so called; thence\r\n   by the shore around Long Cove and the creek; thence to the\r\n   head of Pigeon Hill Bay aforesaid; thence by the shore to the\r\n   first-mentioned bound.\r\n\r\n   SEC. 2. All fines and penalties under this act may be recovered as\r\n   provided in section 48 of chapter 285 of the Public Laws of 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTATIONS OF LIVE LOBSTERS.\r\n\r\nFor some years there have been considerable importations of live\r\nlobsters into Maine from the British Provinces, particularly from New\r\nBrunswick; previous to the closing up of the canning industry they\r\nwere more numerous than at present, as considerable numbers were\r\nbrought in by boat fishermen for the canneries at or near Eastport.\r\nThe importations are now made by the dealers, who frequently send\r\ntheir own smacks into the Provinces for a supply when lobsters are\r\nscarce in the State.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the importations into the State, by customs\r\ndistricts, for the fiscal year 1898:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    1898\r\n                             ------------------\r\n   Customs districts.

In the\r\nboat fishermen, Washington County leads with 639, followed closely by\r\nKnox County with 606. In the total number of persons employed Knox\r\nCounty leads with 749, while Washington and Hancock counties have very\r\nnearly the same number, 695 and 683, respectively. The total number of\r\npersons employed was 3,304.\r\n\r\nHancock County leads in the number of vessels fishing, 78, valued at\r\n$33,000, while Knox County leads in the number of transporting\r\nvessels, 33, valued at $51,900, and is also second in the number of\r\nfishing vessels. Cumberland County is second in the number of\r\ntransporting vessels. This county has more steam transporting vessels\r\nthan all the other counties combined, 8, valued at $31,200. In the\r\nmatter of boats engaged in the shore fishery Knox County also has the\r\npreeminence, with 696 boats, valued at $37,175. Lincoln, Hancock, and\r\nWashington counties follow in the order named, and are all three very\r\nclose to each other.\r\n\r\nHancock County leads in the number of pots used in the vessel fishery,\r\n7,146, while Knox County is second. Knox County leads in the number of\r\npots used in shore fisheries with 39,040, valued at $39,030, and is\r\nfollowed by Lincoln County with 29,190 pots, valued at $29,190.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of shore property Lincoln County leads with $16,917,\r\nalthough if the property used in the wholesale trade had been included\r\nin this table Cumberland County would lead. In the total investment\r\nKnox County leads with $169,056. Hancock County comes second,\r\nwith $136,651, followed by Washington and Cumberland counties,\r\nrespectively. The total investment for the whole State is $616,668.\r\n\r\nIn vessel catch Hancock County leads with 444,704 pounds, valued at\r\n$47,101.

Lincoln County is third and Washington\r\nCounty fourth. The total catch for the State is 11,183,294 pounds,\r\nvalued at $992,855.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Table showing by counties the number of persons employed\r\n   in the lobster fishery of Maine in 1898.\r\n\r\n                 Vessel             Boat\r\n                 fisher-  Trans-   fisher-  Shores-\r\n     County       men     porters    men      men     Total\r\n     ------       ---     -------    ---      ---     -----\r\n   Washington     30        19       639       7       695\r\n   Hancock       173        27       480       3       683\r\n   Penobscot       2                                     2\r\n   Waldo                              19                19\r\n   Knox           55        78       606      10       749\r\n   Lincoln        12        11       447       4       474\r\n   Sagadahoc.                2        98               100\r\n   Cumberland     10        45       379       6       440\r\n   York            4         3       135               142\r\n                 ---       ---     -----      --     -----\r\n      Total      280       185     2,803      30     3,304\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Table showing by counties the vessels, boats, apparatus, and\r\n   shore property employed in the lobster fishery of Maine in 1898.\r\n\r\n                  Washington       Hancock        Penobscot        Waldo\r\n                 -----------      -----------     -----------    -----------\r\nItems.
