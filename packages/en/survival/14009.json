Both are of iron and wood, and the following are the\r\nprincipal dimensions of the Colbert, which apply very closely to the\r\nTrident: She is 321 ft. 6 in. long, 59 ft. 6 in. beam, and 29 ft. 6\r\nin. draught aft. Her displacement is 8,457 tons, her indicated horse\r\npower is 4,652, and her speed 14.4 knots. She has coal carrying\r\ncapacity for 700 tons, and her crew numbers 706. The thickness of her\r\narmor belt is 8.66 in., that protecting the central battery is 6.29\r\nin. thick, which is also the thickness of the transverse armored\r\nbulkheads, while the deck is 0.43 in. in thickness. The armament of\r\nthe Colbert consists of eight 10.63 in. guns, two 9.45 in., six 5.51\r\nin., two quick firing guns, and fourteen revolving and machine\r\nguns.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA compound locomotive, built by the Rhode Island Locomotive Works, has\r\nbeen tried on the Union Elevated Railroad, Brooklyn, N.Y.

From report in the _Boston\r\nJournal of Commerce_.]\r\n\r\nBy THOMAS HAWLEY.\r\n\r\nRIDING CUT-OFF VALVES--PECULIARITIES AND MERITS OF THE DIFFERENT\r\nSTYLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering the slide valve in its simple form with or without lap,\r\nwe find there are certain limitations to its use as a valve that would\r\ngive the best results. The limitation of most importance is that its\r\nconstruction will not allow of the proper cut off to obtain all the\r\nbenefits of expansion without hindering the perfect action of the\r\nvalve in other particulars. At this economical cut off the opening of\r\nthe steam port is very little and very narrow, and although this is\r\nattempted to be overcome by exceedingly wide ports, sixteen inches in\r\nwidth in many cases in locomotive work, this great width adds largely\r\nto the unbalanced area of the valve. The exhausting functions of the\r\nvalve are materially changed at the short cut off, and when much lap\r\nis added to overcome this defect, there usually takes place a choking\r\nof the exhaust port. You might inquire, why not make the port wider,\r\nbut this would increase the minimum amount of load on the valve, and\r\nthis must not be overlooked. Then the cut off is a fixed one, and we\r\ncan govern only by throttling the pressure we have raised in the\r\nboiler or by using a cut off governor and the consequent wastes of an\r\nenormous clearance space. You will observe, therefore, that the plain\r\nslide valve engine gives the most general satisfaction at about\r\ntwo-thirds cut off and a very low economic result. The best of such\r\nengines will require forty-five to fifty pounds of steam per horse\r\npower per hour, and to generate this, assuming an evaporation of nine\r\npounds of water to a pound of coal, would require between five and six\r\npounds of coal per horse power per hour. And the only feature that the\r\nvalve has specially to commend it is its extreme simplicity and the\r\nvery little mechanism required to operate it.\r\n\r\nYet this is of considerable importance, and in consideration of some\r\nspecial features at its latest cut off, the attempt has been many\r\ntimes made to take advantage of these features. For instance, at 90°\r\nadvance, the valve opens very rapidly indeed and fully satisfies our\r\nrequirements of a perfect valve. This is one good point, and in this\r\nposition also the exhaust and compression can be regulated very\r\nclosely and as desired without much lap, and as the opening of the\r\nexhaust port comes with the eccentric at its most rapid movement the\r\nrelease is very quick and as we would have it. This is only possible\r\nat the most uneconomic position of the valve as regards cut off.\r\n\r\nThe aim of many engineers has been to take advantage of these matters\r\nby using the valve with 90° angular advance of eccentric ahead of\r\ncrank, for the admission, release, and compression of the steam, and\r\nprovide another means of cutting off, besides the one already referred\r\nto, viz., cutting off the supply of steam to the chest, and overcome\r\nthe objection in this one of large clearance spaces. This is done by\r\nmeans of riding cut off valves, often called expansion valves, of\r\nwhich, perhaps, the most widely known types in this vicinity are the\r\nKendall & Roberts engine and the Buckeye. The former is used in the\r\nsimplest form of riding cut off, while the Buckeye has many peculiar\r\nfeatures that engineers, I find, are too prone to overlook in a casual\r\nexamination of the engine. In these uses of the slide valve, too,\r\nmeans are suggested and carried out of practically balancing the\r\nvalve.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the riding cut off is most generally attributed to\r\nGonzenbach. His arrangement had two steam chests, the lower one\r\nprovided with the ordinary slide valve of late cut off, and steam was\r\ncut off from this steam chest by the expansion valve covering the\r\nports connecting with the upper steam chest. This had the old\r\ndisadvantage that all the steam in the lower chest expanded with that\r\nin the cylinder, at a consequent considerable loss. This was further\r\nimproved by causing the riding cut off to be upon the top of the main\r\nvalve, instead of its chest, and resulted in a considerable reduction\r\nof the clearance space.\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest form, and is shown in Fig. 1. The steam is\r\nsupplied by a passage through the main valve which operates exactly as\r\nan ordinary slide valve would. That is, the inside edges of the steam\r\npassage are the same as the ordinary valve, the additional piece on\r\neach end, if I may so term it, being merely to provide a passage for\r\nthe steam which can be closed, instead of allowing the steam to pass\r\nthe edge. The eccentric of the main valve is fastened to the shaft to\r\ngive the proper amount of lead, and the desired release and\r\ncompression, and the expansion valve is operated by a separate\r\neccentric fastened in line with or 180° ahead of the crank. When the\r\npiston, therefore, commences to move from the crank end to open the\r\nport, D, the expansion valve is forced by its eccentric in the\r\nopposite direction, and is closing the steam port and would have\r\nclosed it before the piston reached quarter stroke, thus allowing the\r\nsteam then in the cylinder to do work by expansion. The eccentric\r\noperating this expansion valve may be set to close this steam port at\r\nany point in the stroke that is desired, the closing occurring when\r\nthe expansion valve has covered the steam port. Continuing the\r\nmovements of the valves, the two would move together until one or the\r\nother reached its dead center, when the movements would be in opposite\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThere are three ways of effecting the cut off in such engines, the\r\nmain valve meanwhile being undisturbed, its eccentric fastened\r\nsecurely so as not to disturb the points of lead, release, and\r\ncompression. All that is required is to cause the edge of the\r\nexpansion valve to cover the steam port earlier in the stroke, and\r\nthis can be done, first, by increasing the angular advance of the cut\r\noff eccentric; second, by adding lap to the cut off valve; and third\r\nby changing the throw of the eccentric. In all these instances the\r\nriding valve is caused to reach the edge of the steam port earlier in\r\nthe stroke. We will take first, as the simplest, those methods by\r\nwhich the lap of the cut off valve is increased.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that there is but one edge of this valve that is\r\nrequired to do any work, and that is to close the valve. The\r\neccentrics are so placed that the passage in the main valve is opened\r\nlong before the main valve itself is ready to admit steam to the\r\ncylinder, so that only the outer edges are the ones to be considered,\r\nand it will be readily seen that the two valves traveling in opposite\r\ndirections, any lap added to the working edge of the cut off valve\r\nwill cause it to reach the edge and therefore close the port earlier\r\nthan it would if there was less lap. And we might carry it to the\r\nextreme that we could add lap enough that the steam passage would not\r\nbe opened at all.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 2 is shown the method by which this is accomplished, in what\r\nis called Meyer's valve, and such as is used in the Kendall & Roberts\r\nengine. We have only one point to look after, the cut off, so we can\r\nadd all the lap we wish without disturbing anything else. In this\r\nengine the lap is changed by hand by means of a little hand wheel on a\r\nstem that extends out of the rear of the steam chest. The valve is in\r\ntwo sections, and when it is desired to cut off earlier, the hand\r\nwheel is turned in such a direction that the right and left hand\r\nscrews controlling the cut off valve move one valve portion back and\r\nthe other forward, which would, if they were one valve and they should\r\nbe so considered, have the effect of lengthening them, or adding lap\r\nto them. The result would be that the riding valve would reach the\r\nedge of the steam port earlier in the stroke, bringing about an\r\nearlier cut off. If the cut off is desired to be later, the hand wheel\r\nis so turned that the right and left hand screws will bring the valve\r\nsections nearer together, thus practically taking off lap. Now this\r\nmay be done by hand or it may be done by the action of a governor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIn the latter case the governor at each change of load turns the right\r\nand left hand screws to add or take away lap, as the load demands an\r\nearlier or later cut off; in other cases the governor moves a rack in\r\nmesh with a gear by which the valve sections are brought closer\r\ntogether or are separated. The difficulty with the case where the hand\r\nwheel is turned by hand is that the cut off is fixed where you leave\r\nit, and governing can only be at the throttle. For this reason\r\nanywhere near full boiler pressure would not be obtained in the\r\ncylinder of the engine. If the load was a constant one, and the cut\r\noff could be fixed at about one-third, causing the throttle to open\r\nits widest, very good results would be obtained, but there is no\r\nmargin left for governing.\r\n\r\nIf the load should increase at such a time the governor could not\r\ncontrol it under these conditions, and it would lead to a decrease in\r\nspeed unless the lap was again changed to give a later cut off. On\r\nthis account the general practice soon becomes to leave the cut off at\r\nthe later point and give range to the throttle, and we come back once\r\nmore to the plain slide valve cutting off at half stroke, and the only\r\ngain there is, is in a quick port opening and quick cut off. But these\r\nmatters are more than offset by the wire drawing between the steam\r\npipe and chest, through the throttle, and the fact that there is added\r\nto the friction of the engine the friction of this additional slide\r\nvalve and a considerable liability to have a leaky valve.\r\n\r\nIn the case where the governor changes the position of the cut off\r\nvalve a greater decree of economy would result. In this engine, of\r\nwhich the Lambertville engine is a type, the main valve is a long D\r\nslide, with multiple ports at the ends through which the steam enters\r\nthe cylinders. It is operated from an eccentric on the crank shaft in\r\nthe usual manner. The cut off valve is also operated from the motion\r\non an eccentric fixed upon the crank shaft. The rod or stem of the cut\r\noff valve passes through the main valve rod and slide. Upon the outer\r\nend of the cut off valve rod are tappets fastened to engage with\r\ntappets on the eccentric valve rod. Connection between the cut off\r\neccentric, therefore, and the cut off valve is only by means of the\r\nengagement of these tappets. The eccentric rod is fastened to a rocker\r\narm having motion swinging about a pin or bearing in the governor\r\nslide, which may be raised or lowered by a cam operated by the\r\ngovernor. The cut off slide is of cylindrical shape and incloses a\r\nspring and dash pot with disks attached by means of which the valve is\r\nclosed. The motion for operating the valves is relatively in the same\r\ndirection, the cut off eccentric having the greatest throw and greater\r\nangular advance to cause it to open earlier and quickly before the\r\nmain valve is ready to admit steam. The cut off eccentric rod swinging\r\nthe rocker arm, the tappets thereon engage with those upon the cut off\r\nvalve rod and open the passages to the main valve, and in their\r\nmovement compress the spring in the main valve. According as the speed\r\nof the engine, the rock arm will be raised or lowered so that the\r\ntappets upon the eccentric rod may keep in engagement a shorter or\r\nlonger time before they disengage, thus allowing the spring that has\r\nbeen compressed by the movement of the cut off valve to close that\r\nvalve quickly and the supply of steam to the engine, the cut off valve\r\ntraveling with the main valve for the balance of the stroke. This\r\ndevice will give a remarkably quick opening and a quick cut off, but\r\nin view of the fact that the governor has so much to do, its delicacy\r\nis impaired and a quick response to the demands of the load changing\r\nnot so likely to occur. The cut off cannot be as quick as in some\r\nother engines, because the valves are moving in opposite directions,\r\nand while this fact would help, so far as shortening the distance to\r\nbe traveled before cut off, the resistance of the valves to travel in\r\nopposite directions, or rather the tendency of the valve to travel\r\nwith the main valve, hinders its rapid action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThis is one great objection to the rack and gear operated by the\r\ngovernor, that two flat valves riding upon each other and sliding in\r\nopposite directions at times require a considerable amount of force to\r\nmove them, and as only a slight change in load is required by the\r\nload, the governor cannot handle the work as delicately as it should.\r\nIt is too much for the governor to do well. To overcome this\r\ndifficulty the Ryder cut-off, shown in Fig. 3, was made by the\r\nDelamater people, of New York. The main slide valve is hollowed in the\r\nback and the ports cut diagonally across the valve to form almost a\r\nletter V. The expansion valve is V-shaped, and circular to fit its\r\ncircular-seat. The valve rod of the expansion valve has a sector upon\r\nit and operated by a gear upon the governor stem, which rotates the\r\nvalve rod, and the edge of the valve rod is brought farther over the\r\nsteam port, thus practically adding lap to the valve. Little movement\r\nis found necessary to make the ordinary change in cut-off, and it is\r\nfound to be much easier to move the riding valve across the valve than\r\nin a direction directly opposite. It would require considerable force\r\nto move the upper valve by the governor faster than the lower, or in a\r\ndirection opposite to that in which it is moving, but very little\r\nforce applied sideways at the same time it is moving forward will give\r\nit a sideways motion. In this device the governor has only to exert\r\nthis side pressure and therefore has less to do than if it were called\r\nupon to move the upper valve directly against the movement of the\r\nlower.\r\n\r\nSomething similar is the valve of the Woodbury engine, of Rochester,\r\nN.Y. The cut-off valve is cylindrical, covering diagonal ports\r\ndirectly opposite, and is caused to be rotated by the action of the\r\ngovernor that operates a rack in mesh with a segment. Very little\r\nmovement will effect a considerable change in the lappage of the\r\nvalve, the valve turning about one-quarter a revolution for the\r\nextremes of cut off. The cut off valve rod works through a bracket and\r\nits end terminates in a ball in a socket on the end of the eccentric\r\nrod. In this case the governor has not as much to do as in other\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nStill another method of effecting this change in cut off, but hardly\r\nby increasing the lap of the valve, is shown in the next drawing, Fig.\r\n4. The cut off valve is held upon the main valve by the pressure of\r\nsteam upon its back and rides with it until it comes in contact with\r\nthe cut off wedge-shaped blocks, when its motion is arrested, and the\r\nmain valve continuing its movement the steam port is closed by the\r\nmain valve passing beneath the cut off valve. Thus the main valve\r\ntravels and carries the cut off valve upon its back again until the\r\ncut off valve strikes the wedge on the other end and the cut off is\r\neffected. The relative positions of the blocks are determined by the\r\ngovernor, that will raise or lower them so that the cut off valve will\r\nengage with them earlier or later as desired. This device was designed\r\nspecially as an inexpensive method of changing the common slide valve\r\ninto an automatic cut off. The cut off would not be as quick as in\r\nother cases we have cited, depending here upon the movement of the\r\nlower valve alone, and that, too, is in its slowest movement; whereas\r\nin the other cases, the edges approaching each other, by the differing\r\nmovement of the valves the cut off is very rapid, provided the\r\ndistance to travel is not long. In this device considerable noise must\r\nresult by the cut off valve striking the cut off blocks, and a\r\nconsiderable amount of leakage is likely to occur past this valve.\r\n\r\nBut there is one great objection in the valve gears thus far cited,\r\nthat the travel of the expansion valve upon the main valve is\r\nvariable. I have in mind the case of a Kendall & Roberts engine, which\r\nhad been run for a long time at no better economy than would be\r\nobtained from a plain slide valve engine, and when it was attempted to\r\nget an earlier cut off by separating the two cut off valves, they had\r\nworn so much in their old place on the valve that shoulders were found\r\nsufficient to cause a disagreeable noise and a leaky valve. This is\r\nvery apt to occur, not only where the valve is run for a long time on\r\none seat, but in cases of variation of the travel of the expansion\r\nvalve. The result is that a change will bring about a leaky valve,\r\nsomething that every engineer abhors.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Buckeye engine, which is also of this type, is\r\nsuch that the travel of the valve on the back of the main valve is\r\nalways the same, no matter what the cut off may be. Then this engine\r\nmakes use of our second proposition as a means of effecting the cut\r\noff, viz., by advancing the eccentric. You will readily observe that\r\nanything that will cause the cut off valve to reach a certain point\r\nearlier in the stroke will bring about an earlier cut off as it\r\nhastens everything all around. This is the plan pursued in the\r\nBuckeye, in which the governor, of the shaft type, turns the eccentric\r\nforward or back according as the load demands. Then, in addition, the\r\nvalve is balanced partially, the attempt not being made to produce an\r\nabsolutely balanced valve, on the ground that there should be friction\r\nenough to keep the surfaces bright and to prevent leakage. The most\r\nperfect valve will, of course, be entirely balanced under all\r\nconditions of pressure so as to move with perfect ease. With the\r\nriding cut off valve in connection with the plain slide valve, this is\r\nnot accomplished, and it does not matter whether it is partially\r\nunbalanced to prevent leakage or not, the fact that it is not entirely\r\nbalanced prevents it reaching the ideal valve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5]\r\n\r\nThis valve, Fig. 5, differs from the others also in this particular,\r\nthat the exhaust takes place at the end of the valve instead of under\r\nthe arch. Two eccentrics are used, the one for the main valve being\r\nfastened to the shaft and the other riding loosely upon it and\r\nconnected to the fly wheel governor, by which it may be turned forward\r\nor back as the load requires. The three points of lead, or admission\r\nand exhaust and compression, are fixed and independent of the changes\r\nand cut off. The motion of the main eccentric is given to a rocker\r\narm, the pivot of which is at the bottom, and from the upper end the\r\nvalve rod transfers the motion to the valve without reversing the\r\nmotion, as is done sometimes in the slide valve to overcome the\r\neffects of the angularity of the connecting rod. The action of the\r\nrocker arm, therefore, so far as the main valve in the Buckeye is\r\nconcerned, is no different than that which would occur if no rocker\r\narm intervened. The motion of the cut off eccentric, through its\r\neccentric rod, is given to a rocker rocking in a bearing in the center\r\nof the main rocker arm (see Fig. 6). The motion of this eccentric is\r\nreversed, so far as the cut off valve is concerned, and when the cut\r\noff eccentric is moving forward, the cut off valve is being pushed\r\nback. The main valve rod is hollow, and the cut off valve rod passes\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\r\n\r\nThe cut off eccentric can be placed in any position to cause it to cut\r\noff as desired, and by drawing the valve forward, by increasing the\r\nangular advance of the eccentric, the cut off valve is caused to reach\r\nand cover the steam passage in the main valve earlier in the stroke.\r\nInstead of being ahead of the crank, the main eccentric in this\r\narrangement follows the crank, on account of the exhaust and steam\r\nedges being exactly opposite from those in the ordinary slide. What is\r\nthe steam edge of the common slide is in this the exhaust edge, and\r\nwhat is the exhaust edge in the common valve is the steam edge in this\r\none. The valve, therefore, must be moved in the opposite direction\r\nfrom what is ordinarily the case, the main eccentric being not 90 deg.\r\nbehind the crank. It has a rapid and full opening just the same, for\r\nit is at this point behind the crank, or ahead of it, that the\r\neccentric gives to the valve its quickest movement, or between the\r\neccentric dead centers. The cut off eccentric is considerably ahead of\r\nthe main eccentric, and about even with the crank. If it was not for\r\nthe reversal of motion of the cut off valve through the rocker arm\r\nthis eccentric would be about in line with the crank, but on the other\r\nend. The movement of the cut off valve, therefore, at the time of port\r\nopening is very little, being about on its dead center, passing which,\r\nit immediately commences to close.\r\n\r\nThe object of the peculiar construction of the rocker arm, and the\r\npivot for the cut off rocker being placed thereon, is to provide equal\r\ntravel on the back of the main valve, no matter what the cut off. I\r\nhave already explained, in connection with the slide valve, that\r\nadvancing the eccentric does not change the movement of the valve on\r\nits seat, but simply its relation to the movement of the piston. You\r\nwill see that this is unchanged as using the main valve as a seat or\r\nany other seat. If the main valve was to remain stationary, and only\r\nthe cut off valve to be operated by its eccentric, the movement of\r\nthis cut off valve on a certain plane would be the same for all\r\npositions of the eccentric.\r\n\r\nMoving the main slide does not affect the matter in any way, for it\r\nmoves at the same time the pivot of the cut off, and while the cut off\r\nseat has assumed a different position with reference to the engine, it\r\nis still as though stationary so far as the cut off valve is\r\nconcerned. This is the object of this peculiar construction, and not,\r\nas some engineers suppose, simply to make an odd way of doing things.\r\nAnd the object of it all is to give at all cut offs the same amount of\r\ntravel, so that there might be no unequal wear to bring about a leak,\r\nto prevent which a perfect balancing has been sacrificed.\r\n\r\nReferring to the valve and this engine as to how it will satisfy our\r\nrequirements of a perfect valve gear, we find that the first\r\nrequirement of a rapid and full opening is met, in that the opening\r\noccurs when the main eccentric is moving very rapidly, yet not its\r\nfastest, and while this opening will be very satisfactory, it is not\r\nso rapid an opening as is obtained in some other forms of valves and\r\nvalve gears, but this could be overcome very readily by increasing the\r\nlead a trifle, and in my experience with these engines I find that the\r\npractice is very general by engineers and by builders themselves to\r\ngive them a considerable amount of lead. As to the second requirement,\r\nthe maintenance of initial pressure until cut off, giving a straight\r\nsteam line, cards from this engine will not be found to show that the\r\nengine satisfies this requirement, and for this reason, that the\r\ncut-off valve commences to close the port immediately after the piston\r\ncommences to move. The cut off eccentric you will remember is set to\r\nmove with the crank or very nearly so, and the lighter the load, the\r\ngreater will this fact appear. For the lightest loads the governor\r\nplaces the eccentric in advance of the crank, so that the cut off\r\nvalve will commence to close the port before steam is admitted by the\r\nmain valve to the engine. Now, the later the cut off, the less will\r\nthis wire drawing appear at first, and the shorter the cut off, the\r\namount of wire drawing increases sensibly. The operation of the valve,\r\ntherefore, in this particular, cannot be considered as meeting our\r\nrequirement that the port shall be held open full width until ready to\r\nbe closed. Many men claim for this engine that the closing occurs when\r\nthe cut off eccentric is moving its fastest. This is a fact, and if we\r\nconsider the point of cut off only to be the point of absolute cut\r\noff, the cut off must be instantaneous, for there is an instantaneous\r\npoint where the cut off is final only to be considered. The reasoning\r\napplied here would hold good also to a less extent on the slide valve,\r\nbut is not the point of absolute cut off. We want to note how long it\r\nis from the time the valve commences to close at all until finally\r\nclosed, and, as I have shown you, this is considerable in this engine.\r\n\r\nReferring to the point of cut off finally, it is determined upon by a\r\ngovernor of the fly wheel type. The eccentric is loose about the\r\nshaft, and arms projecting therefrom are connected by other arms to\r\nthe extremity of an arm upon which is mounted a weight, and which is\r\nattached to the spokes of the fly wheel, or special governor wheel in\r\nthis case, and which is fastened to the crank shaft. As the speed\r\nincreases through throwing off a portion of the load the governor\r\nweights fly out, and this movement is transferred through the lever\r\nconnections to the eccentric, causing it to be turned ahead, and the\r\nmanner hastening the movement of the cut off valve on its seat and\r\ncausing it to reach and cover the edge of the steam port earlier in\r\nthe stroke. This engine was the pioneer in governors of this\r\ncharacter, the advantage being, in addition to its necessity for the\r\nwork of turning the eccentric ahead or back, that the liability of the\r\nengine to run away, as very often happens from the breaking of the\r\ngovernor belt or a similar cause, was not possible.\r\n\r\nThe cut off valve has a travel considerably beyond the edge of the\r\nsteam passage after the valve is closed, and this has one advantage,\r\nthat the valve is less liable to leak, and to this must be added the\r\nloss from the friction of this moving valve, and moving too in\r\nopposition to the main valve. In our perfect valve, as we outlined it,\r\nthe valve does not move after the port is closed. The exhausting\r\nfunctions of the valve are very good, giving a quick opening and a\r\nfull opening, because this opening occurs when the eccentric is moving\r\nits fastest. The engine also possesses a distinct advantage in having\r\nremarkably small clearance spaces. The length of the steam passage is\r\nvery small in comparison with any form of engine, and having but two\r\nports instead of four, as in the Corliss and four valve type.\r\n\r\nIn these there must be included in the clearance, that to the exhaust\r\nport as well as the steam port, adding a considerable amount where the\r\npiston comes close to the head. As the engines leave the maker's hand\r\nthe engines are provided with a considerable amount of lap to give\r\nplenty of compression, but are, of course, capable of having more\r\nadded to increase compression, or some planed off to decrease it.\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiar things about this engine is the failure to realize\r\nanywhere near boiler pressure, noticeable in every case that has come\r\nunder my notice. The considerable lead gives it for an instant, but it\r\nsoon falls away, indicating the steam chest pressure only by a peak at\r\nthe junction of the admission and steam lines. This is probably due to\r\nthe fact that the cut off valve commences closing the steam passage so\r\nsoon after steam is admitted, and in this particular does not satisfy\r\nthe requirements of a perfect valve. There is this about the engine,\r\nthat above all others of this type there has come under my notice\r\nfewer engines of this type with a maladjustment of valves from\r\ntampering by incompetent engineers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRING POINTS OF VARIOUS EXPLOSIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn apparatus, devised by Horsley, was used, which consisted of an iron\r\nstand with a ring support holding a hemispherical iron vessel, in\r\nwhich paraffin or tin was put. Above this was another movable support,\r\nfrom which a thermometer was suspended and so adjusted that its bulb\r\nwas immersed in molten material in the iron vessel. A thin copper\r\ncartridge case, 5/8 in. in diameter and 1-5/16 in. long, was suspended\r\nover the bath by means of a triangle, so that the end of the case was\r\n1 in. below the surface of the liquid. On beginning the experiment the\r\nmaterial in the bath was heated to just above the melting point, the\r\nthermometer was inserted in it, and a minute quantity of the explosive\r\nwas placed in the bottom of the cartridge case. The temperature marked\r\nby the thermometer was noted as the _initial temperature_, the\r\ncartridge case containing the explosive was inserted in the bath, and\r\nthe temperature quickly raised until the explosive flashed off or\r\nexploded, when the temperature marked by the thermometer was again\r\nnoted as the _firing point_. The tables given show the results of\r\nabout six experiments with each explosive. The initial temperatures\r\nrange from 65° to 280° C. in some cases, but as the firing points\r\nremained fairly constant, only the extremes of the latter are quoted\r\nin the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\n    --------------------------------+-----------------------\r\n       Description of Explosive.    |  Firing Point in ° C.\r\n    --------------------------------+-----------------------\r\n    Compressed military gun-cotton. |      186 - 201\r\n    Air-dried military gun-cotton.  |      179 - 186\r\n        \"        \"         \"        |      186 - 189\r\n        \"        \"         \"        |      137 - 139\r\n        \"        \"         \"        |      154 - 161\r\n    Gun-cotton dried at 65° C.      |      136 - 141\r\n    Air-dried collodion gun-cotton. |      186 - 191\r\n        \"        \"         \"        |      197 - 199\r\n        \"        \"         \"        |      193 - 195\r\n    Air-dried gun-cotton.           |      192 - 197\r\n        \"          \"                |      194 - 199\r\n    Hydro-nitrocellulose.           |      201 - 213\r\n    Nitroglycerin.                  |      203 - 205\r\n    Kieselghur dynamite.

This establishment,\r\nwhich is as yet but little known, is destined to render the greatest\r\nservices to manufacturers and cultivators.\r\n\r\nIn fact, agriculture now has recourse to physics and mechanics as well\r\nas to chemistry. Now, although there were agricultural laboratories\r\nwhose mission it was to fix the choice of the cultivator upon such or\r\nsuch a seed or fertilizer, there was no official establishment\r\ndesigned to inform him as to the value of machines, the models of\r\nwhich are often very numerous. _Chemical_ advice was to be had, but\r\n_mechanical_ advice was wanting. It is such a want that has just been\r\nsupplied. Upon the report presented by Mr. Tisserand, director of\r\nagriculture, a ministerial decree of the 24th of January, 1888,\r\nordered the establishment of an experimental station. Mr. Ringelmann,\r\nprofessor of rural engineering at the school of Grignon, was put in\r\ncharge of the installation of it, and was appointed its director. He\r\nimmediately began to look around for a site, and on the 17th of\r\nDecember, 1888, the Municipal Council of Paris, taking into\r\nconsideration the value of such an establishment to the city's\r\nindustries, decided that a plot of ground of an area of 3,309 square\r\nmeters, situated on Jenner Street, should be put at the disposal of\r\nthe minister of agriculture for fifteen years for the establishment\r\nthereon of a trial station. This land, bordering on a very wide street\r\nand easy of access, opposite the municipal buildings, offers, through\r\nits area, its situation, and its neigborhood, indisputable advantages.\r\nA fence 70 meters in extent surrounds the station. An iron gate opens\r\nupon a paved path that ends at the station.\r\n\r\nThe year 1889 was devoted to the installation, and the station is now\r\nin full operation. The tests that can be made here are many, and\r\nconcern all kinds of apparatus, even those connected with the electric\r\nlighting that the agriculturist may employ to facilitate his\r\nexploitation. However, the tests that are oftenest made are (1) of\r\nrotary apparatus, such as mills, thrashing machines, etc.; (2) of\r\ntraction machines, such as wagons, carts, plows, etc.; and (3) of\r\nlifting apparatus. It is possible, also, to make experiments on the\r\nresistance of materials.\r\n\r\nThe experimental hall contains a 7 horse power gas motor, dynamometers\r\nwith automatic registering apparatus, counters, balances, etc. A small\r\nmachine shop contains a lathe, a forge, a drilling machine, etc. The\r\nmain shaft is 12 meters in length and is 7 centimeters in diameter. It\r\nis supported at a distance of one meter from the floor by four pillow\r\nblocks, and is formed of three sections united by movable coupling\r\nboxes. Out of these 12 meters, 9 are in the hall and 3 extend beyond\r\nthe hall to an annex, 14 meters in length and 4 in width, in which\r\ntests are made of machines whose operation creates dust. When the\r\nmachines to be tested require more than the power of seven horses that\r\nthe motor gives, the persons interested furnish a movable engine,\r\nwhich, placed under the annex, actuates the driving shaft. Alongside\r\nof the main building there is a ring for experimenting upon machines\r\nactuated by a horse whim. There will soon be erected in the center of\r\nthe grounds an 18 meter tower for experiments on pumps. Platforms\r\nspaced 5 meters apart, a crane at the top, and some gauging apparatus\r\nwill complete this hydraulic installation.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of the hall is very complete, and is fitted for all\r\nkinds of experiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATION FOR TESTING AGRICULTURAL MACHINES--DYNAMOMETER\r\n               FOR TESTING ROTARY MACHINES.]\r\n\r\nThe tests of rotary machines are made by means of a dynamometer (see\r\nfigure). Two fast pulleys and one loose pulley are interposed between\r\nthe machine to be tested and the motor. The pulley connected with the\r\nmotor carries along the one connected with the machine, through the\r\nintermedium of spring plates, whose strength varies with the nature of\r\nthe apparatus to be tested. The greater or less elongation of these\r\nplates gives the tangential stress exerted by the driving pulley to\r\ncarry along the pulley that actuates the machine to be tested. This\r\nelongation is registered by means of a pencil connected with the\r\nspring plates, and which draws a diagram upon a sheet of paper. At the\r\nsame time, a special totalizer gives the stress in kilogrammeters.\r\nBesides, the pulley shaft actuates a revolution counter, and a clock\r\nmeasures the time employed in the experiment. In order to obtain a\r\nsimultaneous starting and stopping point for all these apparatus, they\r\nare connected electrically, and, through the maneuver of a commutator,\r\nare all controlled at once. The electric current is furnished by two\r\nseries of bichromate batteries.\r\n\r\nThe tests of traction machines are effected by means of a\r\nthree-wheeled vehicle carrying a dynamometer. The front wheel is\r\ncapable of turning freely in the horizontal plane, and the dynamometer\r\nis mounted upon a frame provided with a screw that permits of\r\nregulating its position according to the slope of the ground. The\r\nmethod of suspension of the dynamometer allows it to take\r\nautomatically the inclination of the line of traction without any\r\ntorsion of the plates. There are two models of this vehicle, one\r\ndesigned to be drawn by a man, and the other by a horse.\r\n\r\nThe station is provided, in addition, with registering pressure\r\ngauges, a large double dynamometric indicator, a counter of\r\nelectricity, balances of precision, etc.\r\n\r\nAn apparatus designed for measuring the rendering of presses is now in\r\ncourse of construction.\r\n\r\nAlthough the station has been in operation only from the 1st of\r\nJanuary, twenty-five machines have already been presented to be\r\ntested.--_Extract from Le Genie Civil_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER SOFTENING AND PURIFYING APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have recently had brought under our notice a system of water and\r\nsewage purification which appears to possess several substantial\r\nadvantages. Chief among these are simplicity in construction and\r\noperation, economy in first cost and working and efficiency in action.\r\nThis system is the invention of Messrs. Slack & Brownlow, of Canning\r\nWorks, Upper Medlock Street, Manchester, and the apparatus adopted in\r\ncarrying it out is here illustrated. It consists of an iron\r\ncylindrical tank having inside a series of plates arranged in a spiral\r\ndirection around a fixed center, and sloping downward at a\r\nconsiderable angle outward. The water to be purified and softened\r\nflows through the large inlet tube to the bottom, mixing on its way\r\nwith the necessary chemicals, and entering the apparatus at the\r\nbottom, rises to the top, passing spirally round the whole\r\ncircumference, and depositing on the plates all solids and impurities.\r\n\r\nAll that is needed in the way of attention, even when dealing with\r\nsewage, or the most polluted waters, is stated to be the mixing in the\r\nsmall tanks the necessary chemical reagents, at the commencement of\r\nthe working day; and at the close of the day the opening of the mud\r\ncocks shown in our engraving, to remove the collected deposit upon the\r\nplates. For the past six months this system has been in operation at a\r\ndye works in Manchester, successfully purifying and softening the\r\nfoul waters of the river Medlock. It is stated that 84,000 gallons per\r\nday can be easily purified by an apparatus 7 feet in diameter. The\r\nchemicals used are chiefly lime, soda, and alumina, and the cost of\r\ntreatment is stated to vary from a farthing to twopence per 1,000\r\ngallons, according to the degree of impurity of the water or sewage\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nThe results of working at Manchester show that all the visible filth\r\nis removed from the Medlock's inky waters, besides which the hardness\r\nof the water is reduced to about 6° from a normal condition of about\r\n30°. The effluent is fit for all the varied uses of a dye works, and\r\nis stated to be perfectly capable of sustaining fish life. With\r\nresults such as these the system should have a promising future before\r\nit in respect of sewage treatment, as well as the purification and\r\nsoftening of water generally for industrial and manufacturing\r\npurposes.--_Iron._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER SOFTENING AND PURIFYING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRISECTION OF ANY ANGLE.\r\n\r\nBy FREDERIC R. HONEY, Ph.B., Yale University.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following analysis shows that with the aid of an hyperbola any\r\narc, and therefore any angle, may be trisected.\r\n\r\nIf the reader should not care to follow the analytical work, the\r\nconstruction is described in the last paragraph--referring to Fig. II.\r\n\r\nLet a b c d (Fig. I.) be the arc subtending a given angle. Draw the\r\nchord a d and bisect it at o. Through o draw e f perpendicular\r\nto a d.\r\n\r\nWe wish to find the locus of a point c whose distance from a given\r\nstraight line e f is one-half the distance from a given point d.\r\n\r\nIn order to write the equation of this curve, refer it to the\r\nco-ordinate axes a d (axis of X) and e f (axis of Y), intersecting\r\nat the origin o.\r\n\r\n                           Let g c = x\r\n\r\nTherefore, from the definition c d = 2x\r\n\r\n                           Let o d = D\r\n                       [Hence] h d = D-x\r\n\r\n                           Let c h = y\r\n                     [Hence] (2x)² = y² + (D-x)²\r\n                            or 4x² = y² + D²-2Dx + x²\r\n           [Hence] y²-3x² + D²-2Dx = o [I.]\r\n\r\nThis is the equation of an hyperbola whose center is on the axis of\r\nabscisses. In order to determine the position of the center, eliminate\r\nthe x term, and find the distance from the origin o to a new origin\r\no'.\r\n\r\n                      Let E = distance from o to o'\r\n                  [Hence] x = x' + E\r\n\r\nSubstituting this value of x in equation I.\r\n\r\n                y²-3(x' + E)² + D²-2D(x' + E) = o\r\n             or y²-3x²-6Ex'-3E² + D²-2Dx'-2DE = o [II.]\r\n\r\nIn this equation the x' terms should disappear.\r\n\r\n             [Hence] -6Ex' - 2Dx' = o\r\n             [Hence] -E =  - D/3\r\n\r\nThat is, the distance from the origin o to the new origin or the\r\ncenter of the hyperbola o' is equal to one-third of the distance\r\nfrom o to d; and the minus sign indicates that the measurement\r\nshould be laid off to the left of the origin o.

OGDEN STOUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know it is the custom with a great many if not the majority of\r\nopticians to fit a customer without knowing whether he has presbyopia,\r\nhypermetropia, or any of the other errors of refraction. Their method\r\nis first to try a convex, and if this does not improve, a concave,\r\netc., until the proper one is found. This, of course, amounts to the\r\nsame thing if the right glass is found. But in practice it will be\r\nfound both time saving and more satisfactory to first decide with what\r\nerror you have to deal. It is very simple, and, where you have no\r\nother means of diagnosing (such as the ophthalmoscope), it does away\r\nwith the necessity of trying so many lenses before the proper one is\r\nfound. You should have a distance test card placed at a distance of\r\ntwenty feet from the person you are examining, and in a good light.\r\n\r\nA distance test card consists of letters of various sizes which it has\r\nbeen found can be seen at certain distances by people with good\r\nvision. Thus the largest letter is marked with a cc, meaning that this\r\nshould be seen at two hundred feet, and another line, XX, at twenty\r\nfeet, which is the proper distance for testing vision for distance,\r\nfor the reason that a normal eye is at rest when looking at any object\r\ntwenty feet from it or beyond, and the rays coming from it are\r\nparallel and come to a focus on the retina. You must also have a near\r\nvision test card with lines that should be seen by a normal eye from\r\nten to seventy-two inches, and a card of radiating lines for\r\nastigmatism. With this preparation you are ready to proceed. To\r\nillustrate, the first customer comes and tells you that up to six\r\nmonths ago he had very good vision, but he finds now that, especially\r\nat night, he has trouble in reading or writing, and that he finds he\r\ncan see better a little farther away. His head aches and eyes smart.\r\nYou will of course say that this is a very simple case. It must be old\r\nsight (presbyopia). Probably it is if he is old enough (45), but you\r\nmust prove this for yourself, without asking his age, which is\r\nembarrassing in the case of a lady. If you direct him to the distance\r\ncard twenty feet away, and find that he can see every one down to and\r\nincluding the one marked XX, his vision is up to the standard for\r\ndistance, and you know that he can have no astigmatism worth\r\ncorrecting, nor any near sight, as both of these affect vision for\r\ndistance, but he may have far sight or old sight or both combined. You\r\nmust find which it is.\r\n\r\nIf, while he is still looking at the twenty-foot line, you place in\r\nfront of the eyes a weak convex and he tells you he sees just as well\r\nwith as without, it proves the existence of far-sight or\r\nhypermetropia, and the strongest convex that still leaves vision as\r\ngood for distance as without any, corrects the manifest. But if the\r\nweak convex blurs it, it shows that there is some defect in focusing,\r\nif the near vision is below normal. You therefore know that you have a\r\ncase of old sight or presbyopia, requiring the weakest convex to\r\ncorrect it, that will enable your customer to see the finest line on\r\nthe near card at the required distance.\r\n\r\nThe next customer that comes to be fitted with glasses can only see\r\nthe line marked XL on the distance card at 20 feet or about one-half\r\nof what he should see, which leads you to think that there is no far\r\nsight, for vision for distance is good except in very high degrees of\r\nthis error. Nor can there be old-sight, for vision for distance is\r\ngood in old-sight until after the fifty-fifth year, but it can be near\r\nsight (myopia) or astigmatism, or both. We next try the near card and\r\nfind that even the finest line can be seen clearly if held\r\nsufficiently close to the eyes. We now know that this is a case of\r\nnear sight, and we must fit them with glasses for distance. The\r\nweakest concave that will enable him to see the line that should be\r\nseen on the distance card at 20 feet is the proper one to give him for\r\nuse.--_The Optician._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES GOODYEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES GOODYEAR was born in New Haven, December 29, 1800. He was the\r\nson of Amasa Goodyear, and the eldest among six children. His father\r\nwas quite proud of being a descendant of Stephen Goodyear, one of the\r\nfounders of the colony of New Haven in 1638.\r\n\r\nAmasa Goodyear owned a little farm on the neck of land in New Haven\r\nwhich is now known as Oyster Point, and it was here that Charles spent\r\nthe earliest years of his life. When, however, he was quite young, his\r\nfather secured an interest in a patent for the manufacture of ivory\r\nbuttons, and looking for a convenient location for a small mill,\r\nsettled at Naugatuck, Conn., where he made use of the valuable water\r\npower that is there. Aside from his manufacturing, the elder Goodyear\r\nran a farm, and between the two lines of industry kept young Charles\r\npretty busy.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, Charles left his home and went to Philadelphia to learn the\r\nhardware business. He worked at this very industriously until he was\r\ntwenty-one years old, and then, returning to Connecticut, entered into\r\npartnership with his father at the old stand in Naugatuck, where they\r\nmanufactured not only ivory and metal buttons, but a variety of\r\nagricultural implements, which were just beginning to be appreciated\r\nby the farmers. In August of 1824 he was united in marriage with\r\nClarissa Beecher, a woman of remarkable strength of character and\r\nkindness of disposition, and one who in after years was of the\r\ngreatest assistance to the impulsive inventor. Two years later he\r\nremoved again to Philadelphia, and there opened a hardware store. His\r\nspecialties were the valuable agricultural implements that his firm\r\nhad been manufacturing, and after the first distrust of home made\r\ngoods had worn away--for all agricultural implements were imported\r\nfrom England at that time--he found himself established at the head of\r\na successful business.\r\n\r\nThis continued to increase until it seemed but a question of a few\r\nyears until he would be a very wealthy man. Between 1829 and 1830 he\r\nsuddenly broke down in health, being troubled with dyspepsia. At the\r\nsame time came the failure of a number of business houses that\r\nseriously embarrassed his firm. They struggled on, however, for some\r\ntime, but were finally obliged to fail. The ten years that followed\r\nthis were full of the bitterest struggles and trials to Goodyear.\r\nUnder the law that then existed he was imprisoned time after time for\r\ndebts, even while he was trying to perfect inventions that should pay\r\noff his indebtedness.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1831 and 1832 he began to hear about gum elastic and\r\nvery carefully examined every article that appeared in the newspapers\r\nrelative to this new material. The Roxbury Rubber Company, of Boston,\r\nhad been for some time experimenting with the gum, and believing that\r\nthey had found means for manufacturing goods from it, had a large\r\nplant and were sending their goods all over the country. It was some\r\nof their goods that first attracted his attention. Soon after this\r\nGoodyear visited New York, and went at once to the store of the\r\nRoxbury Rubber Company. While there, he examined with considerable\r\ncare some of their life preservers, and it struck him that the tube\r\nused for inflation was not very perfect. He, therefore, on his return\r\nto Philadelphia, made some tubes and brought them down to New York and\r\nshowed them to the manager of the Roxbury Rubber Company.\r\n\r\nThis gentlemen was so pleased with the ingenuity that Goodyear had\r\nshown in manufacturing these tubes, that he talked very freely with\r\nhim and confessed to him that the business was on the verge of ruin,\r\nthat the goods had to be tested for a year before they could tell\r\nwhether they were perfect or not, and to their surprise, thousands of\r\ndollars worth of goods that they had supposed were all right were\r\ncoming back to them, the gum having rotted and made them so offensive\r\nthat it was necessary to bury them in the ground to get them out of\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nGoodyear at once made up his mind to experiment on this gum and see if\r\nhe could not overcome its stickiness.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, returned to Philadelphia, and, as usual, met a\r\ncreditor, who had him arrested and thrown into prison. While there, he\r\ntried his first experiments with India rubber. The gum was very cheap\r\nthen, and by heating it and working it in his hands, he managed to\r\nincorporate in it a certain amount of magnesia which produced a\r\nbeautiful white compound and appeared to take away the stickiness.\r\n\r\nHe therefore thought he had discovered the secret, and through the\r\nkindness of friends was put in the way of further perfecting his\r\ninvention at a little place in New Haven. The first thing that he made\r\nhere was shoes, and he used his own house for grinding room, calender\r\nroom, and vulcanizing department, and his wife and children helped to\r\nmake up the goods. His compound at this time was India rubber,\r\nlampblack, and magnesia, the whole dissolved in turpentine and spread\r\nupon the flannel cloth which served as the lining for the shoes. It\r\nwas not long, however, before he discovered that the gum, even treated\r\nthis way, became sticky, and then those who had supplied the money for\r\nthe furtherance of these experiments, completely discouraged, made up\r\ntheir minds that they could go no further, and so told the inventor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES GOODYEAR.]\r\n\r\nHe, however, had no mind to stop here in his experiments, but, selling\r\nhis furniture and placing his family in a quiet boarding place, he\r\nwent to New York, and there, in an attic, helped by a friendly\r\ndruggist, continued his experiments. His next step in this line was to\r\ncompound the rubber with magnesia and then boil it in quicklime and\r\nwater. This appeared to really solve the problem, and he made some\r\nbeautiful goods. At once it was noised abroad that India rubber had\r\nbeen so treated that it lost its stickiness, and he received medals\r\nand testimonials and seemed on the high road to success, till one day\r\nhe noticed that a drop of weak acid, falling on the cloth, neutralized\r\nthe alkali, and immediately the rubber was soft again. To see this,\r\nwith his knowledge of what rubber should do, proved to him at once\r\nthat his process was not a successful one. He therefore continued\r\nexperimenting, and after preparing his mixtures in his attic in New\r\nYork, would walk three miles to the mill of a Mr. Pike, at Greenwich\r\nvillage, and there try various experiments.\r\n\r\nIn the line of these, he discovered that rubber, dipped in nitric\r\nacid, formed a surface cure, and he made a great many goods with this\r\nacid cure which were spoken of, and which even received a letter of\r\ncommendation from Andrew Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe constant and varied experiments that Goodyear went through with\r\naffected his health more or less, and at one time he came very near\r\nbeing suffocated by gas generated in his laboratory. That he did not\r\ndie then everybody knows, but he was thrown then into a fever by the\r\naccident and came very near losing his life.\r\n\r\nIt was there that he formed an acquaintance with Dr. Bradshaw, who was\r\nvery much pleased with the samples of rubber goods that he saw in\r\nGoodyear's room, and when the doctor went to Europe he took them with\r\nhim, where they attracted a great deal of attention, but beyond that\r\nnothing was done about them. Now that he appeared to have success, he\r\nfound no difficulty in obtaining a partner, and together the two\r\ngentlemen fitted up a factory and began to make clothing, life\r\npreservers, rubber shoes, and a great variety of rubber goods. They\r\nalso had a large factory, with special machinery, built at Staten\r\nIsland, where he removed his family and again had a home of his own.\r\nJust about this time, when everything looked bright, the great panic\r\nof 1836-1837 came, and swept away the entire fortune of his associate\r\nand left Goodyear without a cent, and no means of earning one.\r\n\r\nHis next move was to go to Boston, where he became acquainted with J.\r\nHaskins, of the Roxbury Rubber Company, and found in him a firm\r\nfriend, who loaned him money and stood by him when no one would have\r\nanything to do with the visionary inventor. Mr. Chaffee was also\r\nexceedingly kind and ever ready to lend a listening ear to his plans,\r\nand to also assist him in a pecuniary way. It was about this time that\r\nit occurred to Mr. Chaffee that much of the trouble that they had\r\nexperienced in working India rubber might come from the solvent that\r\nwas used. He therefore invented a huge machine for doing the mixing\r\nby mechanical means. The goods that were made in this way were\r\nbeautiful to look at, and it appeared, as it had before, that all\r\ndifficulties were overcome.\r\n\r\nGoodyear discovered a new method for making rubber shoes and got a\r\npatent on it, which he sold to the Providence Company, in Rhode\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThe secret of making the rubber so that it would stand heat and cold\r\nand acids, however, had not been discovered, and the goods were\r\nconstantly growing sticky and decomposing and being returned.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 he, for the first time, met Nathaniel Hayward, who was then\r\nrunning a factory in Woburn. Some time after this Goodyear himself\r\nmoved to Woburn, all the time continuing his experiments. He was very\r\nmuch interested in Hayward's sulphur experiments for drying rubber,\r\nbut it appears that neither of them at that time appreciated the fact\r\nthat it needed heat to make the sulphur combine with the rubber and to\r\nvulcanize it.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending the discovery of his celebrated process is\r\nthus described by Mr. Goodyear himself in his book, \"Gum Elastic.\" It\r\nwill be observed that he makes use of the third person in all\r\nreferences to himself:\r\n\r\n  \"In the summer of 1838 he became acquainted with Mr. Nathaniel\r\n  Hayward, of Woburn, Mass., who had been employed as the foreman of\r\n  the Eagle Company at Woburn, where he had made use of sulphur by\r\n  impregnating the solvent with it. It was through him that the\r\n  writer (Charles Goodyear, who makes use all through his book of\r\n  the third person) received the first knowledge of the use of\r\n  sulphur as a drier of gum elastic.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Hayward was left in possession of the factory which was\r\n  abandoned by the Eagle Company. Soon after this it was occupied by\r\n  the writer, who employed him for the purpose of manufacturing life\r\n  preservers and other articles by the acid gas process. At this\r\n  period he made many novel and useful applications of this\r\n  substance. Among other fancy articles he had newspapers printed on\r\n  the gum elastic drapery, and the improvement began to be highly\r\n  appreciated. He therefore now entered, as he thought, upon a\r\n  successful career for the future. A far different result awaited\r\n  him.\r\n\r\n  \"It was supposed by others as well as himself that a change was\r\n  wrought through the mass of the goods acted upon by the acid gas,\r\n  and that the whole body of the article was made better than the\r\n  native gum. The surface of the goods really was so, but owing to\r\n  the eventual decomposition of the goods beneath the surface, the\r\n  process was pronounced by the public a complete failure. Thus\r\n  instead of realizing the large fortune which by all acquainted\r\n  with his prospects was considered certain, his whole invention\r\n  would not bring him a week's living.\r\n\r\n  \"He was obliged for the want of means to discontinue\r\n  manufacturing, and Mr. Hayward left his employment. The inventor\r\n  now applied himself alone, with unabated ardor and diligence, to\r\n  detect the cause of his misfortune and if possible to retrieve the\r\n  lost reputation of his invention. On one occasion he made some\r\n  experiments to ascertain the effect of heat upon the same compound\r\n  that had decomposed in the articles previously manufactured, and\r\n  was surprised to find that the specimen, being carelessly brought\r\n  in contact with a hot stove, charred like leather. He endeavored\r\n  to call the attention of his brother as well as some other\r\n  individuals who were present, and who were acquainted with the\r\n  manufacture of gum elastic, to this effect as remarkable and\r\n  unlike any before known, since gum elastic always melted when\r\n  exposed to a high degree of heat. The occurrence did not at the\r\n  time appear to them to be worthy of notice. It was considered as\r\n  one of the frequent appeals that he was in the habit of making in\r\n  behalf of some new experiment. He, however, directly inferred that\r\n  if the process of charring could be stopped at the right point, it\r\n  might divest the gum of its native adhesiveness throughout, which\r\n  would make it better than the native gum.\r\n\r\n  \"He made another trial of heating a similar fabric, before an open\r\n  fire. The same effect, that of charring the gum, followed, but\r\n  there were further and very satisfactory indications of ultimate\r\n  success in producing the desired result, as upon the edge of the\r\n  charred portions of the fabric there appeared a line, or border,\r\n  that was not charred, but perfectly cured.\r\n\r\n  \"These facts have been stated precisely as they occurred in\r\n  reference to the acid gas, as well as the vulcanizing process.\r\n\r\n  \"The incidents attending the discovery of both have a strong\r\n  resemblance, so much so they may be considered parallel cases. It\r\n  being now known that the results of the vulcanizing process are\r\n  produced by means and in a manner which would not have been\r\n  anticipated from any reasoning on the subject, and that they have\r\n  not yet been satisfactorily accounted for, it has been sometimes\r\n  asked, how the inventor came to make the discovery? The answer has\r\n  already been given. It may be added that he was many years seeking\r\n  to accomplish this object, and that he allowed nothing to escape\r\n  his notice that related to the subject. Like the falling of an\r\n  apple, it was suggestive of an important fact to one whose mind\r\n  was previously prepared to draw an inference from any occurrence\r\n  which might favor the object of his research. While the inventor\r\n  admits that these discoveries were not the results of scientific\r\n  chemical investigations, _he is not willing to admit that they\r\n  were the result of what is commonly termed accident_; he claims\r\n  them to be the result of the closest application and observation.\r\n\r\n  \"The discoloring and charring of the specimens proved nothing and\r\n  discovered nothing of value, but quite the contrary, for in the\r\n  first instance, as stated in the acid gas improvement, the\r\n  specimen acted upon was thrown away as worthless and left for some\r\n  time; in the latter instance, the specimen that was charred was in\r\n  like manner disregarded by others.\r\n\r\n  \"It may, therefore, be considered as one of those cases where the\r\n  leading of the Creator providentially aids his creatures, by what\r\n  are termed 'accidents,' to attain those things which are not\r\n  attainable by the powers of reasoning he has conferred on them.\"\r\n\r\nNow that Goodyear was sure that he had the key to the intricate puzzle\r\nthat he had worked over for so many years, he began at once to tell\r\nhis friends about it and to try to secure capital, but they had\r\nlistened to their sorrow so many times that his efforts were futile.\r\nFor a number of years be struggled and experimented and worked along\r\nin a small way, his family suffering with himself the pangs of the\r\nextremest poverty. At last he went to New York and showed some of his\r\nsamples to William Ryder, who, with his brother Emory, at once\r\nappreciated the value of the discovery and started in to\r\nmanufacturing. Even here Goodyear's bad luck seemed to follow him, for\r\nthe Ryder Bros. failed and it was impossible to continue the business.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, started a small factory at Springfield, Mass., and\r\nhis brother-in-law, Mr. De Forest, who was a wealthy woolen\r\nmanufacturer, took Ryder's place, and the work of making the invention\r\npractical was continued. In 1844 it was so far perfected that Goodyear\r\nfelt it safe to take out a patent. The factory at Springfield was run\r\nby his brothers, Nelson and Henry.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 Henry started one in Naugatuck, and in 1844 introduced\r\nmechanical mixing in place of the mixture by the use of solvents.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1852 Goodyear went to Europe, a trip that he had long\r\nplanned, and saw Hancock, then in the employ of Charles Macintosh &\r\nCo. Hancock admitted in evidence that the first piece of vulcanized\r\nrubber he ever saw came from America, but claimed to have reinvented\r\nvulcanization and secured patents in Great Britain, but it is _a\r\nremarkable fact_ that Charles Goodyear's French patent was the first\r\npublication in Europe of this discovery.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 a French company were licensed by Mr. Goodyear to make shoes,\r\nand a great deal of interest was felt in the new business. In 1855 the\r\nFrench emperor gave to Charles Goodyear the grand medal of honor and\r\ndecorated him with the cross of the legion of honor in recognition of\r\nhis services as a public benefactor, but the French courts\r\nsubsequently set aside his French patents on the ground of the\r\nimportation of vulcanized goods from America by licenses under the\r\nUnited States patents. He died July 1, 1860, at the Fifth Avenue\r\nHotel, New York City.--_India Rubber World_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 786, page 12558.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTROMAGNET.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Lectures delivered before the Society of Arts, London,\r\n1890.

SC., B.A., M.I.E.E.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nRESEARCHES OF PROFESSOR HUGHES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--HUGHES' ELECTROMAGNET.]\r\n\r\nHis object was to find out the best form of electromagnet, the best\r\ndistance between the poles, and the best form of armature for the\r\nrapid work required in Hughes' printing telegraphs. One word about\r\nHughes' magnets. This diagram (Fig. 51) shows the form of the well\r\nknown Hughes' electromagnet. I feel almost ashamed to say those words\r\n\"well known,\" because on the Continent everybody knows what you mean\r\nby a Hughes' electromagnet. In England scarcely anyone knows what you\r\nmean. Englishmen do not even know that Professor Hughes has invented a\r\nspecial form of electromagnet. Hughes' special form is this: A\r\npermanent steel magnet, generally a compound one, having soft iron\r\npole pieces, and a couple of coils on the pole pieces only. As I have\r\nto speak of Hughes' special contrivance among the mechanisms that will\r\noccupy our attention later on, I only now refer to this magnet in one\r\nparticular. If you wish a magnet to work rapidly, you will secure the\r\nmost rapid action, not when the coils are distributed all along, but\r\nwhen they are heaped up near, not necessarily entirely on, the poles.\r\nHughes made a number of researches to find out what the right length\r\nand thickness of these pole pieces should be. It was found an\r\nadvantage not to use too thin pole pieces, otherwise the magnetism\r\nfrom the permanent magnet did not pass through the iron without\r\nconsiderable reluctance, being choked by insufficiency of section:\r\nalso not to use too thick pieces, otherwise they presented too much\r\nsurface for leakage across from one to the other. Eventually a\r\nparticular length was settled upon, in proportion about six times the\r\ndiameter, or rather longer. In the further researches that Hughes made\r\nhe used a magnet of shorter form, not shown here, more like those\r\nemployed in relays, and with an armature from 2 to 3 millimeters\r\nthick, 1 centimeter wide and 5 centimeters long. The poles were turned\r\nover at the top toward one another. Hughes tried whether there was any\r\nadvantage in making those poles approach one another, and whether\r\nthere was any advantage in having as long an armature as 5\r\ncentimeters. He tried all the different kinds, and plotted out the\r\nresults of observations in curves, which could be compared and\r\nstudied. His object was to ascertain the conditions which would give\r\nthe strongest pull, not with a steady current, but with such currents\r\nas were required for operating his printing telegraph instruments;\r\ncurrents which lasted but one to twenty hundredths of a second. He\r\nfound it was decidedly an advantage to shorten the length of the\r\narmature, so that it did not protrude far over the poles. In fact, he\r\ngot a sufficient magnetic circuit to secure all the attractive power\r\nthat he needed, without allowing as much chance of leakage as there\r\nwould have been had the armature extended a longer distance over the\r\npoles. He also tried various forms of armature having very various\r\ncross sections.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION AND FORM OF ARMATURE.\r\n\r\nIn one of Du Moncel's papers on electromagnets[1] you will also find a\r\ndiscussion on armatures, and the best forms for working in different\r\npositions. Among other things in Du Moncel you will find this paradox:\r\nthat whereas using a horseshoe magnet with fat poles, and a flat piece\r\nof soft iron for armature, it sticks on far tighter when put on\r\nedgeways; on the other hand, if you are going to work at a distance,\r\nacross air, the attraction is far greater when it is set flatways. I\r\nexplained the advantage of narrowing the surfaces of contact by the\r\nlaw of traction, B², coming in. Why should we have for action at a\r\ndistance the greater advantage from placing the armature flatway to\r\nthe poles? It is simply that you thereby reduce the reluctance offered\r\nby the air gap to the flow of the magnetic lines. Du Moncel also tried\r\nthe difference between round armatures and flat ones, and found that a\r\ncylindrical armature was only attracted about half as strongly as a\r\nprismatic armature having the same surface when at the same distance.\r\nLet us examine this fact in the light of the magnetic circuit. The\r\npoles are flat. You have at a certain distance away a round armature;\r\nthere is a certain distance between its nearest side and the polar\r\nsurfaces. If you have at the same distance away a flat armature having\r\nthe same surface, and, therefore, about the same tendency to leak, why\r\ndo you get a greater pull in this case than in that? I think it is\r\nclear that if they are at the same distance away, giving the same\r\nrange of motion, there is a greater magnetic reluctance in the case of\r\nthe round armature, although there is the same periphery, because,\r\nthough the nearest part of the surface is at the prescribed distance,\r\nthe rest of the under surface is farther away; so that the gain found\r\nin substituting an armature with a flat surface is a gain resulting\r\nfrom the diminution in the resistance offered by the air gap.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"La Lumiere Electrique,\" vol. ii.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLE PIECES ON HORSESHOE MAGNETS.\r\n\r\nAnother of Du Moncel's researches[2] relates to the effect of polar\r\nprojections or shoes--movable pole pieces, if you like--upon a\r\nhorseshoe electromagnet. The core of this magnet was of round iron 4\r\ncentimeters in diameter, and the parallel limbs were 10 centimeters\r\nlong and 6 centimeters apart. The shoes consisted of two flat pieces\r\nof iron slotted out at one end, so that they could be slid along over\r\nthe poles and brought nearer together. The attraction exerted on a\r\nflat armature across air gaps 2 millimeters thick was measured by\r\ncounterpoising. Exciting this electromagnet with a certain battery, it\r\nwas found that the attraction was greatest when the shoes were pushed\r\nto about 15 millimeters, or about one-quarter of the interpolar\r\ndistance, apart. The numbers were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Distance between\r\n     shoes.           Attraction,\r\n   Millimeters.       in grammes.\r\n\r\n       2                  900\r\n      10                1,012\r\n      15                1,025\r\n      25                  965\r\n      40                  890\r\n      60                  550\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"La Lumiere Electrique,\" vol. iv., p. 129.]\r\n\r\nWith a stronger battery the magnet without shoes had an attraction of\r\n885 grammes, but with the shoes 15 millimeters apart, 1,195 grammes.\r\nWhen one pole only was employed, the attraction, which was 88 grammes\r\nwithout a shoe, was _diminished_ by adding a shoe to 39 grammes!\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRAST BETWEEN ELECTROMAGNETS AND PERMANENT MAGNETS.\r\n\r\nNow I want particularly to ask you to guard against the idea that all\r\nthese results obtained from electromagnets are equally applicable to\r\npermanent magnets of steel; they are not, for this simple reason. With\r\nan electromagnet, when you put the armature near, and make the\r\nmagnetic circuit better, you not only get more magnetic lines going\r\nthrough that armature, but you get more magnetic lines going through\r\nthe whole of the iron. You get more magnetic lines round the bend when\r\nyou put an armature on to the poles, because you have a magnetic\r\ncircuit of less reluctance with the same external magnetizing power in\r\nthe coils acting around it. Therefore, in that case, you will have a\r\ngreater magnetic flux all the way round. The data obtained with the\r\nelectromagnet (Fig. 42), with the exploring coil, C, on the bend of\r\nthe core, where the armature was in contact, and when it was removed\r\nare most significant. When the armature was present it multiplied the\r\ntotal magnetic flow tenfold for weak currents and nearly threefold for\r\nstrong currents. But with a steel horseshoe, magnetized once for all,\r\nthe magnetic lines that flow around the bend of the steel are a fixed\r\nquantity, and, however much you diminish the reluctance of the\r\nmagnetic circuit, you do not create or evoke any more. When the\r\narmature is away the magnetic lines arch across, not at the ends of\r\nthe horseshoe only, but from its flanks; the whole of the magnetic\r\nlines leaking somehow across the space. Where you have put the\r\narmature on, these lines, instead of arching out into space as freely\r\nas they did, pass for the most part along the steel limbs and through\r\nthe iron armature. You may still have a considerable amount of\r\nleakage, but you have not made one line more go through the bent part.\r\nYou have absolutely the same number going through the bend with the\r\narmature off as with the armature on. You do not add to the total\r\nnumber by reducing the magnetic reluctance, because you are not\r\nworking under the influence of a constantly impressed magnetizing\r\nforce. By putting the armature on to a steel horseshoe magnet you\r\nonly _collect_ the magnetic lines, you do not _multiply_ them. This is\r\nnot a matter of conjecture. A group of my students have been making\r\nexperiments in the following way: They took this large steel horseshoe\r\nmagnet (Fig. 52), the length of which, from end to end, through the\r\nsteel, is 42½ inches. A light, narrow frame was constructed so that it\r\ncould be slipped on over the magnet, and on it were wound 30 turns of\r\nfine wire, to serve as an exploring coil. The ends of this coil were\r\ncarried to a distant part of the laboratory, and connected to a\r\nsensitive ballistic galvanometer. The mode of experimenting is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe coil is slipped on over the magnet (or over its armature) to any\r\ndesired position. The armature of the magnet is placed gently upon the\r\npoles, and time enough is allowed to elapse for the galvanometer\r\nneedle to settle to zero. The armature is then suddenly detached. The\r\nfirst swing measures the change, due to removing the armature, in the\r\nnumber of magnetic lines that pass through the coil in the particular\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--EXPERIMENT WITH PERMANENT MAGNET.]\r\n\r\nI will roughly repeat the experiment before you: The spot of light on\r\nthe screen is reflected from my galvanometer at the far end of the\r\ntable. I place the exploring coil just over the pole, and slide on the\r\narmature; then close the galvanometer circuit. Now I detach the\r\narmature, and you observe the large swing. I shift the exploring coil,\r\nright up to the bend; replace the armature; wait until the spot of\r\nlight is brought to rest at the zero of the scale. Now, on detaching\r\nthe armature, the movement of the spot of light is quite\r\nimperceptible. In our careful laboratory experiments, the effect was\r\nnoticed inch by inch all along the magnet. The effect when the\r\nexploring coil was over the bend was not as great as 1-3000th part of\r\nthe effect when the coil was hard up to the pole. We are, therefore,\r\njustified in saying that the number of magnetic lines in a permanently\r\nmagnetized steel horseshoe magnet is not altered by the presence or\r\nabsence of the armature.\r\n\r\nYou will have noticed that I always put on the armature gently. It\r\ndoes not do to slam on the armature; every time you do so, you knock\r\nsome of the so-called permanent magnetism out of it. But you may pull\r\noff the armature as suddenly as you like. It does the magnet good\r\nrather than harm. There is a popular superstition that you ought never\r\nto pull off the keeper of a magnet suddenly. On investigation, it is\r\nfound that the facts are just the other way. You may pull off the\r\nkeeper as suddenly as you like, but you should never slam it on.\r\n\r\nFrom these experimental results I pass to the special design of\r\nelectromagnets for special purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROMAGNETS FOR MAXIMUM TRACTION.\r\n\r\nThese have already been dealt with in the preceding lecture; the\r\ncharacteristic feature of all the forms suitable for traction being\r\nthe compact magnetic circuit.\r\n\r\nSeveral times it has been proposed to increase the power of\r\nelectromagnets by constructing them with intermediate masses of iron\r\nbetween the central core and the outside, between the layers of\r\nwindings. All these constructions are founded on fallacies. Such iron\r\nis far better placed either right inside the coils or right outside\r\nthem, so that it may properly constitute a part of the magnetic\r\ncircuit. The constructions known as Camacho's and Cance's, and one\r\npatented by Mr. S.A. Varley, in 1877, belonging to this delusive order\r\nof ideas, are now entirely obsolete.\r\n\r\nAnother construction which is periodically brought forward as a\r\nnovelty is the use of iron windings of wire or strip in place of\r\ncopper winding. The lower electric conductivity of iron, as compared\r\nwith copper, makes such a construction wasteful of exciting power. To\r\napply equal magnetizing power by means of an iron coil implies the\r\nexpenditure of about six times as many watts as need be expended if\r\nthe coil is of copper.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROMAGNETS FOR MAXIMUM RANGE OF ATTRACTION.\r\n\r\nWe have already laid down the principle which will enable us to design\r\nelectromagnets to act at a distance. We want our magnet to project, as\r\nit were, its force across the greatest length of air gap. Clearly,\r\nthen, such a magnet must have a very large magnetizing power, with\r\nmany ampere turns upon it, to be able to make the required number of\r\nmagnetic lines pass across the air resistance. Also it is clear that\r\nthe poles must not be too close together for its work, otherwise the\r\nmagnetic lines at one pole will be likely to curl round and take short\r\ncuts to the other pole. There must be a wider width between the poles\r\nthan is desirable in electromagnets for traction.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROMAGNETS OF MINIMUM WEIGHT.\r\n\r\nIn designing an apparatus to put on board a boat or a balloon, where\r\nweight is a consideration of primary importance, there is again a\r\ndifference. There are three things that come into play--iron, copper,\r\nand electric current. The current weighs nothing, therefore, if you\r\nare going to sacrifice everything else to weight, you may have\r\ncomparatively little iron, but you must have enough copper to be able\r\nto carry the electric current; and under such circumstances you must\r\nnot mind heating your wires nearly red hot to pass the biggest\r\npossible current. Provide as little copper as you conveniently can,\r\nsacrificing economy in that case to the attainment of your object;\r\nbut, of course, you must use fireproof material, such as asbestos, for\r\ninsulating, instead of cotton or silk.\r\n\r\n\r\nA USEFUL GUIDING PRINCIPLE.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of design there is one leading principle which will be\r\nfound of great assistance, namely, that a magnet always tends so to\r\nact as though it tried to diminish the length of its magnetic circuit.\r\nIt tries to grow more compact. This is the reverse of that which holds\r\ngood with an electric current. The electric circuit always tries to\r\nenlarge itself, so as to inclose as much space as possible, but the\r\nmagnetic circuit always tries to make itself as compact as possible.\r\nArmatures are drawn in as near as can be, to close up the magnetic\r\ncircuit. Many two-pole electromagnets show a tendency to bend together\r\nwhen the current is turned on. One form in particular, which was\r\ndevised by Ruhmkorff for the purpose of repeating Faraday's celebrated\r\nexperiment on the magnetic rotation of polarized light, is liable to\r\nthis defect. Indeed, this form of electromagnet is often designed very\r\nbadly, the yoke being too thin, both mechanically and magnetically,\r\nfor the purpose which it has to fulfill.\r\n\r\nHere is a small electric bell, constructed by Wagener, of Wiesbaden,\r\nthe construction of which illustrates this principle. The\r\nelectromagnet, a horseshoe, lies horizontally; its poles are provided\r\nwith protruding curved pins of brass. Through the armature are drilled\r\ntwo holes, so that it can be hung upon the two brass pins; and when so\r\nhung up it touches the ends of the iron cores just at one edge, being\r\nheld from more perfect contact by a spring. There is no complete gap,\r\ntherefore, in the magnetic circuit. When the current comes and applies\r\na magnetizing power, it finds the magnetic circuit already complete in\r\nthe sense that there are no absolute gaps. But the circuit can be\r\nbettered by tilting the armature to bring it flat against the polar\r\nends, that being indeed the mode of motion. This is a most reliable\r\nand sensitive pattern of bell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--ELECTROMAGNETIC POP-GUN.]\r\n\r\n_Electromagnetic Pop-gun._--Here is another curious illustration of\r\nthe tendency to complete the magnetic circuit. Here is a tubular\r\nelectromagnet (Fig. 53), consisting of a small bobbin, the core of\r\nwhich is an iron tube about two inches long. There is nothing very\r\nunusual about it; it will stick on, as you see, to pieces of iron when\r\nthe current is turned on. It clearly is an ordinary electromagnet in\r\nthat respect. Now suppose I take a little round rod of iron, about an\r\ninch long, and put it into the end of the tube, what will happen when\r\nI turn on my current? In this apparatus as it stands, the magnetic\r\ncircuit consists of a short length of iron, and then all the rest is\r\nair. The magnetic circuit will try to complete itself, not by\r\nshortening the iron, but by _lengthening_ it; by pushing the piece of\r\niron out so as to afford more surface for leakage. That is exactly\r\nwhat happens; for, as you see, when I turn on the current, the little\r\npiece of iron shoots out and drops down. You see that little piece of\r\niron shoot out with considerable force. It becomes a sort of magnetic\r\npopgun. This is an experiment which has been twice discovered. I found\r\nit first described by Count Du Moncel, in the pages of _La Lumiere\r\nElectrique_, under the name of the \"pistolet electromagnetique;\" and\r\nMr. Shelford Bidwell invented it independently. I am indebted to him\r\nfor the use of this apparatus. He gave an account of it to the\r\nPhysical Society, in 1885, but the reporter missed it, I suppose, as\r\nthere is no record in the society's proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROMAGNETS FOR USE WITH ALTERNATING CURRENTS.\r\n\r\nWhen you are designing electromagnets for use with alternating\r\ncurrents, it is necessary to make a change in one respect, namely, you\r\nmust so laminate the iron that internal eddy currents shall not occur;\r\nindeed, for all rapid-acting electromagnetic apparatus it is a good\r\nrule that the iron must not be solid. It is not usual with telegraphic\r\ninstruments to laminate them by making up the core of bundles of iron\r\nplates or wires, but they are often made with tubular cores, that is\r\nto say, the cylindrical iron core is drilled with a hole down the\r\nmiddle, and the tube so formed is slit with a saw cut to prevent the\r\ncirculation of currents in the substance of the tube. Now when\r\nelectromagnets are to be employed with rapidly alternating currents,\r\nsuch as are used for electric lighting, the frequency of the\r\nalternations being usually about 100 periods per second, slitting the\r\ncores is insufficient to guard against eddy currents; nothing short of\r\ncompletely laminating the cores is a satisfactory remedy. I have here,\r\nthanks to the Brush Electric Engineering Company, an electromagnet of\r\nthe special form that is used in the Brush arc lamp when required for\r\nthe purpose of working in an alternating current circuit. It has two\r\nbobbins that are screwed up against the top of an iron box at the head\r\nof the lamp. The iron slab serves as a kind of yoke to carry the\r\nmagnetism across the top. There are no fixed cores In the bobbins,\r\nwhich are entered by the ends of a pair of yoked plungers. Now in the\r\nordinary Brush lamp for use with a steady current, the plungers are\r\nsimply two round pieces of iron tapped into a common yoke; but for\r\nalternate current working this construction must not be used, and\r\ninstead a U-shaped double plunger is used, made up of laminated iron,\r\nriveted together. Of course it is no novelty to use a laminated core;\r\nthat device, first used by Joule, and then by Cowper, has been\r\nrepatented rather too often during the past fifty years to be\r\nconsidered as a recent invention.\r\n\r\nThe alternate rapid reversals of the magnetism in the magnetic field\r\nof an electromagnet, when excited by alternating electric currents,\r\nsets up eddy currents in every piece of undivided metal within range.\r\nAll frames, bobbin tubes, bobbin ends, and the like, must be most\r\ncarefully slit, otherwise they will overheat. If a domestic flat iron\r\nis placed on the top of the poles of a properly laminated\r\nelectromagnet, supplied with alternating currents, the flat iron is\r\nspeedily heated up by the eddy currents that are generated internally\r\nwithin it. The eddy currents set up by induction in neighboring masses\r\nof metal, especially in good conducting metals such as copper, give\r\nrise to many curious phenomena. For example, a copper disk or copper\r\nring placed over the pole of a straight electromagnet so excited is\r\nviolently repelled. These remarkable phenomena have been recently\r\ninvestigated by Professor Elihu Thomson, with whose beautiful and\r\nelaborate researches we have lately been made conversant in the pages\r\nof the technical journals. He rightly attributes many of the repulsion\r\nphenomena to the lag in phase of the alternating currents thus induced\r\nin the conducting metal. The electromagnetic inertia, or\r\nself-inductive property of the electric circuit, causes the currents\r\nto rise and fall later in time than the electromotive forces by which\r\nthey are occasioned. In all such cases the impedance which the circuit\r\noffers is made up of two things--resistance and inductance. Both these\r\ncauses tend to diminish the amount of current that flows, and the\r\ninductance also tends to delay the flow.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROMAGNETS FOR QUICKEST ACTION.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned Hughes' researches on the form of\r\nelectromagnet best adapted for rapid signaling. I have also\r\nincidentally mentioned the fact that where rapidly varying currents\r\nare employed, the strength of the electric current that a given\r\nbattery can yield is determined not so much by the resistance of the\r\nelectric circuit as by its electric inertia. It is not a very easy\r\ntask to explain precisely what happens to an electric circuit when the\r\ncurrent is turned on suddenly. The current does not suddenly rise to\r\nits full value, being retarded by inertia. The ordinary law of Ohm in\r\nits simple form no longer applies; one needs to apply that other law\r\nwhich bears the name of the law of Helmholtz, the use of which is to\r\ngive us an expression, not for the final value of the current, but for\r\nits value at any short time, t, after the current has been turned on.\r\nThe strength of the current after a lapse of a short time, t, cannot\r\nbe calculated by the simple process of taking the electromotive force\r\nand dividing it by the resistance, as you would calculate steady\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\nIn symbols, Helmholtz's law is:\r\n\r\n       i_{t} = E/R ( 1 - e^{-(R/L)t} )\r\n\r\nIn this formula i_{t} means the strength of the current after the\r\nlapse of a short time t; E is the electromotive force; R, the\r\nresistance of the whole circuit; L, its coefficient of self-induction;\r\nand _e_ the number 2.7183, which is the base of the Napierian\r\nlogarithms. Let us look at this formula; in its general form it\r\nresembles Ohm's law, but with a new factor, namely, the expression\r\ncontained within the brackets. The factor is necessarily a fractional\r\nquantity, for it consists of unity less a certain negative\r\nexponential, which we will presently further consider. If the factor\r\nwithin brackets is a quantity less than unity, that signifies that\r\ni_{t} will be less than E ÷ R. Now the exponential of negative sign,\r\nand with negative fractional index, is rather a troublesome thing to\r\ndeal with in a popular lecture. Our best way is to calculate some\r\nvalues, and then plot it out as a curve. When once you have got it\r\ninto the form of a curve, you can begin to think about it, for the\r\ncurve gives you a mental picture of the facts that the long formula\r\nexpresses in the abstract. Accordingly we will take the following\r\ncase. Let E = 2 volts; R = 1 ohm; and let us take a relatively large\r\nself-induction, so as to exaggerate the effect; say let L = 10 quads.\r\nThis gives us the following:\r\n\r\n      ________________________________________\r\n      |             |              |         |\r\n      |  t_{(sec.)} | e^{+(R/L)t}  |  i_{t}  |\r\n      --------------+--------------+---------|\r\n      |      0      |      1       |  0      |\r\n      |      1      |      1.105   |  0.950  |\r\n      |      2      |      1.221   |  1.810  |\r\n      |      5      |      1.649   |  3.936  |\r\n      |     10      |      2.718   |  6.343  |\r\n      |     20      |      7.389   |  8.646  |\r\n      |     30      |     20.08    |  9.501  |\r\n      |     60      |    403.4     |  9.975  |\r\n      |    120      |  16200.0     |  9.999  |\r\n      ----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn this case the value of the steady current as calculated by Ohm's\r\nlaw is 10 amperes, but Helmholtz's law shows us that with the great\r\nself-induction which we have assumed to be present, the current, even\r\nat the end of 30 seconds, has only risen up to within 5 percent. of\r\nits final value; and only at the end of two minutes has practically\r\nattained full strength. These values are set out in the highest curve\r\nin Fig. 54, in which, however, the further supposition is made that\r\nthe number of spirals, S, in the coils of the electromagnet is 100, so\r\nthat when the current attains its full value of 10 amperes, the full\r\nmagnetizing power will be Si = 1000. It will be noticed that the\r\ncurve rises from zero at first steeply and nearly in a straight line,\r\nthen bends over, and then becomes nearly straight again, as it\r\ngradually rises to its limiting value. The first part of the\r\ncurve--that relating to the strength of the current after _very small_\r\ninterval of time--is the period within which the strength of the\r\ncurrent is governed by inertia (i.e., the self-induction) rather than\r\nby resistance. In reality the current is not governed either by the\r\nself-induction or by the resistance alone, but by the ratio of the\r\ntwo. This ratio is sometimes called the \"time constant\" of the\r\ncircuit, for it represents _the time_ which the current takes in that\r\ncircuit to rise to a definite fraction of its final value.\r\n\r\n  E = 10\r\n  r = 1\r\n  R = 100\r\n  L = 10\r\n\r\n      Si\r\n  1000 +              _..-------------------------------\r\n       |           .                        _ _---------\r\n       |         .                   .----\r\n       |        .                 .-  2 IN SERIES\r\n       |       .               .-\r\n       |      -\r\n       |     .:           - :\r\n       |     .:         .   :\r\n   500 |    . :     __-      -:---------------------------\r\n       |   .  : _.- -       :         2 IN PARALLEL\r\n       |  .   :.  -         :\r\n       | .  / : -           :\r\n       | . /  -             :\r\n       |. / - :             :\r\n       |./.   :             :\r\n       |/_____:_____________:____________________________ t\r\n             10     20     40     60     80    100    120\r\n\r\n             FIG. 54.--CURVES OF RISE OF CURRENTS.\r\n\r\nThis definite fraction is the fraction (e - 1)/e; or in decimals,\r\n0.634. All curves of rise of current are alike in general shape, they\r\ndiffer only in scale, that is to say, they differ only in the height\r\nto which they will ultimately rise, and in the time they will take to\r\nattain this fraction of their final value.\r\n\r\n_Example (1)._--Suppose E = 10; R = 200 ohms; L = 8. The final value\r\nof the current will be 0.025 amp. or 25 milliamperes. Then the time\r\nconstant will be 8 ÷ 400 = 1-50th sec.\r\n\r\n_Example (2)._--The P.O. Standard \"A\" relay has R = 400 ohms; L =\r\n3.25. It works with 0.5 milliampere current, and therefore will work\r\nwith 5 Daniell cells through a line of 9,600 ohms. Under these\r\ncircumstances the time constant of the instrument on short circuit is\r\n0.0081 sec.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the time constant of a circuit can be reduced\r\neither by diminishing the self-induction or by increasing the\r\nresistance. In Fig. 54 the position of the time constant for the top\r\ncurve is shown by the vertical dotted line at 10 seconds. The current\r\nwill take 10 seconds to rise to 0.634 of its final value. This\r\nretardation of the rise of current is simply due to the presence of\r\ncoils and electromagnets in the circuit; the current as it grows being\r\nretarded because it has to create magnetic fields in these coils, and\r\nso sets up opposing electromotive forces that prevent it from growing\r\nall at once to its full strength. Many electricians, unacquainted with\r\nHelmholtz's law, have been in the habit of accounting for this by\r\nsaying that there is a lag in the iron of the electromagnet cores.\r\nThey tell you that an iron core cannot be magnetized suddenly, that it\r\ntakes time to acquire its magnetism. They think it is one of the\r\nproperties of iron. But we know that the only true time lag in the\r\nmagnetization of iron, that which is properly termed \"viscous\r\nhysteresis,\" does not amount to any great percentage of the whole\r\namount of magnetization, takes comparatively a long time to show\r\nitself, and cannot therefore be the cause of the retardation which we\r\nare considering. There are also electricians who will tell you that\r\nwhen magnetization is suddenly evoked in an iron bar, there are\r\ninduction currents set up in the iron which oppose and delay its\r\nmagnetization. That they oppose the magnetization is perfectly true,\r\nbut if you carefully laminate the iron so as to eliminate eddy\r\ncurrents, you will find, strangely enough, that the magnetism rises\r\nstill more slowly to its final value. For by laminating the iron you\r\nhave virtually increased the self-inductive action, and increased the\r\ntime constant of the circuit, so that the currents rise more slowly\r\nthan before. The lag is not in the iron, but in the magnetizing\r\ncurrent, and the current being retarded, the magnetization is of\r\ncourse retarded also.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNECTING COILS FOR QUICKEST ACTION.\r\n\r\nNow let us apply these most important though rather intricate\r\nconsiderations to the practical problems of the quick working of the\r\nelectromagnet. Take the case of an electromagnet forming some part of\r\nthe receiving apparatus of a telegraph system in which it is desired\r\nto secure very rapid working. Suppose the two coils that are wound\r\nupon the horseshoe core are connected together in series. The\r\ncoefficient of self-induction for these two is four times as great as\r\nthat of either separately; coefficients of self-induction being\r\nproportional to the square of the number of turns of wire that\r\nsurround a given core. Now if the two coils instead of being put in\r\nseries are put in parallel, the coefficient of self-induction will be\r\nreduced to the same value as if there were only one coil, because half\r\nthe line current (which is practically unaltered) will go through each\r\ncoil. Hence the time constant of the circuit when the coils are in\r\nparallel will be a quarter of that which it is when the coils are in\r\nseries; on the other hand, for a given line current, the final\r\nmagnetizing power of the two coils in parallel is only half what it\r\nwould be with the coil in series. The two lower curves in Fig. 54\r\nillustrate this, from which it is at once plain that the magnetizing\r\npower for very brief currents is greater when the two coils are put in\r\nparallel with one another than when they are joined in series.\r\n\r\nNow this circumstance has been known for some time to telegraph\r\nengineers. It has been patented several times over. It has formed the\r\ntheme of scientific papers, which have been read both in France and in\r\nEngland. The explanation generally given of the advantage of uniting\r\nthe coils in parallel is, I think, fallacious; namely that the \"extra\r\ncurrents\" (i.e., currents due to self-induction) set up in the two\r\ncoils are induced in such directions as tend to help one another when\r\nthe coils are in series, and to neutralize one another when they are\r\nin parallel. It is a fallacy, because in neither case do they\r\nneutralize one another. Whichever way the current flows to make the\r\nmagnetism, it is opposed in the coils while the current is rising,\r\nand helped in the coils while the current is falling, by the so-called\r\nextra currents. If the current is rising in both coils at the same\r\nmoment, then, whether the coils are in series or in parallel, the\r\neffect of self-induction is to retard the rise of the current. The\r\nadvantage of parallel grouping is simply that it reduces the time\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTERY GROUPING FOR QUICKEST ACTION.\r\n\r\nOne may consider the question of grouping the battery cells from the\r\nsame point of view. How does the need for rapid working, and the\r\nquestion of time constant, affect the best mode of grouping the\r\nbattery cells? The amateur's rule, which tells you to so arrange your\r\nbattery that its internal resistance should be equal to the external\r\nresistance, gives you a result wholly wrong for rapid working. The\r\nsupposed best arrangement will not give you (at the expense even of\r\neconomy) the best result that might be got out of the given number of\r\ncells. Let us take an example and calculate it out, and place the\r\nresults graphically before our eyes in the form of curves. Suppose the\r\nline and electromagnet have together a resistance of 6 ohms, and that\r\nwe have 24 small Daniell cells, each of electromotive force say 1 volt,\r\nand of internal resistance 4 ohms. Also let the coefficient of\r\nself-induction of the electromagnet and circuit be 6 quadrants. When\r\nall the cells are in series, the resistance of the battery will be 96\r\nohms, the total resistance of the circuit 102 ohms, and the full value\r\nof the current 0.235 ampere. When all the cells are in parallel, the\r\nresistance of the battery will be 0.133 ohm, the total resistance\r\n6.133 ohms, and the full value of the current 0.162 ampere. According\r\nto the amateur rule of grouping cells so that internal resistance\r\nequals external, we must arrange the cells in 4 parallels, each having\r\n6 cells in series, so that the internal resistance of the battery will\r\nbe 6 ohms, total resistance of circuit 12 ohms, full value of current\r\n0.5 ampere. Now the corresponding time constants of the circuit in the\r\nthree cases (calculated by dividing the coefficient of self-induction\r\nby the total resistance) will be respectively--in series, 0.06 sec.;\r\nin parallel, 0.5 sec.; grouped for maximum steady current, 0.96 sec.\r\nFrom these data we may now draw the three curves, as in Fig. 55,\r\nwherein the abscissæ are the values of time in seconds and the\r\nordinates the current. The faint vertical dotted lines mark the time\r\nconstants in the three cases. It will be seen that when rapid working\r\nis required the magnetizing current will rise, during short intervals\r\nof time, more rapidly if all the cells are put in series than it will\r\ndo if the cells are grouped according to the amateur rule.\r\n\r\n   |\r\n  5|                                                           .\r\n   |                                                      .\r\n   |                                                 .\r\n  4|                           MAXIMUM         .\r\n   |                          OUTPUT \\    .\r\n   |                                 .\r\n  3|                             .\r\n   |                          .  :     ALL IN SERIES\r\n   |         _-------------------:------------------------------\r\n  2|      .-             -       :\r\n   |    -            -           :\r\n   |  -:         -               :\r\n  1| / :      -                  :             ALL IN PARALLEL\r\n   |.  :  .                      :             _________--------\r\n   |-  :__      :      ----------\r\n   +-----------------------------:-------------------------------\r\n   0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10\r\n\r\nFIG. 55.--CURVES OF RISE OF CURRENT WITH DIFFERENT GROUPINGS OF BATTERY.\r\n\r\nWhen they are all put in series, so that the battery has a much\r\ngreater resistance than the rest of the circuit, the current rises\r\nmuch more rapidly, because of the smallness of the time constant,\r\nalthough it never attains the same ultimate maximum as when grouped in\r\nthe other way. That is to say, if there is self-induction as well as\r\nresistance in the circuit, the amateur rule does not tell you the best\r\nway of arranging the battery. There is another mode of regarding the\r\nmatter which is helpful. Self-induction, while the current is growing,\r\nacts as if there were a sort of spurious addition to the resistance of\r\nthe circuit; and while the current is dying away it acts of course in\r\nthe other way, as if there were a subtraction from the resistance.\r\nTherefore you ought to arrange the battery so that the internal\r\nresistance is equal to the real resistance of the circuit, plus the\r\nspurious resistance during that time. But how much is the spurious\r\nresistance during that time? It is a resistance proportional to the\r\ntime that has elapsed since the current was turned on. So then it\r\ncomes to a question of the length of time for which you want to work\r\nit. What fraction of a second do you require your signal to be given\r\nin? What is the rate of the vibrator of your electric bell? Suppose\r\nyou have settled that point, and that the short time during which the\r\ncurrent is required to rise is called t; then the apparent resistance\r\nat time t after the current is turned on is given by the formula:\r\n\r\n        R_{t} = R × e^{(R/L)t} +  ( e^{(R/L)t} - 1 )\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME CONSTANTS OF ELECTROMAGNETS.\r\n\r\nI may here refer to some determinations made by M. Vaschy,[1]\r\nrespecting the coefficients of self-induction of the electromagnets of\r\na number of pieces of telegraphic apparatus. Of these I must only\r\nquote one result, which is very significant. It relates to the\r\nelectromagnet of a Morse receiver of the pattern habitually used on\r\nthe French telegraph lines.\r\n\r\n                                              L, in quadrants.\r\n    Bobbins, separately, without iron cores.   0.233 and 0.265\r\n    Bobbins, separately, with iron cores.      1.65  and 1.71\r\n    Bobbins, with cores joined by yoke,\r\n       coils in series                         6.37\r\n    Bobbins, with armature resting on poles.  10.68\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Bulletin de la Societe Internationale des Electriciens,\"\r\n1886.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note how the perfecting of the magnetic circuit\r\nincreases the self-induction.\r\n\r\nThanks to the kindness of Mr. Preece, I have been furnished with some\r\nmost valuable information about the coefficients of self-induction,\r\nand the resistance of the standard pattern of relays, and other\r\ninstruments which are used in the British postal telegraph service,\r\nfrom which data one is able to say exactly what the time constants of\r\nthose instruments will be on a given circuit, and how long in their\r\ncase the current will take to rise to any given fraction of its final\r\nvalue. Here let me refer to a very capital paper by Mr. Preece in an\r\nold number of the \"Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers,\" a\r\npaper \"On Shunts,\" in which he treats this question, not as perfectly\r\nas it could now be treated with the fuller knowledge we have in 1890\r\nabout the coefficients of self-induction, but in a very useful and\r\npractical way. He showed most completely that the more perfect the\r\nmagnetic circuit is--though of course you are getting more magnetism\r\nfrom your current--the more is that current retarded. Mr. Preece'e\r\nmode of experiment was extremely simple. He observed the throw of the\r\ngalvanometer when the circuit which contained the battery and the\r\nelectromagnet was opened by a key which at the same moment connected\r\nthe electromagnet wires to the galvanometer. The throw of the\r\ngalvanometer was assumed to represent the extra current which flowed\r\nout. Fig. 56 represents a few of the results of Mr. Preece's paper.\r\n\r\n                                                   +==========+\r\n         |=|                |=|      |=|           |=|      |=|\r\n      \\=======           \\=======  =======/      =======  =======\r\n       |     |            |     |  |     |       |     |  |     |\r\n       |     |            |     |  |     |       |     |  |     |\r\n       |     |            |     |--|     |       |     |  |     |\r\n       =======            =======  =======      /=======  =======\\\r\n         |=|                |=|      |=|           |=|      |=|\r\n\r\n   +===========+            +==========+            +===== ======+\r\n     |=|      |=|           |=|      |=|            |=|        |=|\r\n   =======  =======/    B\\=======  =======/A    A\\=======   =======/B\r\n   |     |  |     |       |     |  |     |        |     |   |     |\r\n   |     |  |     |       |     |  |     |        |     |   |     |\r\n   |     |--|     |       |     |  |     |        |     |   |     |\r\n   =======  =======      A=======  =======B       =======B  =======A\r\n     |=|      |=|           |=|      |=|            |=|        |=|\r\n     +==========+           +==========+            +====== =====+\r\n\r\n          FIG. 56.--ELECTROMAGNETS OF RELAY, AND THEIR EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nTake from an ordinary relay a coil, with its iron core, half the\r\nelectromagnet, so to speak, without any yoke or armature. Connect it\r\nup as described, and observe the throw given to the galvanometer. The\r\namount of throw obtained from the single coil was taken as unity, and\r\nall others were compared with it. If you join up two such coils as\r\nthey are usually joined, in series, but without any iron yoke across\r\nthe cores, the throw was 17. Putting the iron yoke across the cores,\r\nto constitute a horseshoe form, 496 was the throw; that is to say, the\r\ntendency of this electromagnet to retard the current was 496 times as\r\ngreat as that of the simple coil. But when an armature was put over\r\nthe top, the effect ran up to 2,238. By the mere device of putting the\r\ncoils in parallel, instead of in series, the 2,238 came down to 502, a\r\nlittle less than the quarter value which would have been expected.\r\nLastly, when the armature and yoke were both of them split in the\r\nmiddle, as is done in fact in all the standard patterns of the British\r\npostal telegraph relays, the throw of the galvanometer was brought\r\ndown from 502 to 26. Relays so constructed will work excessively\r\nrapidly. Mr. Preece states that with the old pattern of relay having\r\nso much self-induction as to give a galvanometer throw of 1,688, the\r\nspeed of signaling was only from 50 to 60 words per minute, whereas,\r\nwith the standard relays constructed on the new plan, the speed of\r\nsignaling is from 400 to 450 words per minute. It is a very\r\ninteresting and beautiful result to arrive at from the experimental\r\nstudy of these magnetic circuits.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT CORES _versus_ LONG CORES.\r\n\r\nIn considering the forms that are best for rapid action, it ought to\r\nbe mentioned that the effects of hysteresis in retarding changes in\r\nthe magnetization of iron cores are much more noticeable in the case\r\nof nearly closed magnetic circuits than in short pieces.\r\nElectromagnets with iron armatures in contact across their poles will\r\nretain, after the current has been cut off, a very large part of their\r\nmagnetism, even if the cores be of the softest of iron. But so soon as\r\nthe armature is wrenched off, the magnetism disappears. An air gap in\r\na magnetic circuit always tends to hasten demagnetizing. A magnetic\r\ncircuit composed of a long air path and a short iron path demagnetizes\r\nitself much more rapidly than one composed of a short air path and a\r\nlong iron path. In long pieces of iron the mutual action of the\r\nvarious parts tends to keep in them any magnetization that they may\r\npossess; hence they are less readily demagnetized. In short pieces,\r\nwhere these mutual actions are feeble or almost absent, the\r\nmagnetization is less stable, and disappears almost instantly on the\r\ncessation of the magnetizing force. Short bits and small spheres of\r\niron have no magnetic memory. Hence the cause of the commonly received\r\nopinion among telegraph engineers that for rapid work electromagnets\r\nmust have short cores. As we have seen, the only reason for employing\r\nlong cores is to afford the requisite length for winding the wire\r\nwhich is necessary for carrying the needful circulation of current to\r\nforce the magnetism across the air gaps. If, for the sake of rapidity\r\nof action, length has to be sacrificed, then the coils must be heaped\r\nup more thickly on the short cores. The electromagnets in American\r\npatterns of telegraphic apparatus usually have shorter cores, and a\r\nrelatively greater thickness of winding upon them, than those of\r\nEuropean patterns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC ERYGMASCOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe erygmascope is the name of an electric lighting apparatus designed\r\nfor the examination of the strata of earth traversed by boring\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a very powerful incandescent lamp inclosed in a\r\nmetallic cylinder. One of the two semi-cylindrical sides constitutes\r\nthe reflector, and the other, which is of thick glass, allows of the\r\npassage of the luminous rays, which thus illuminate with great\r\nbrilliancy the strata of earth traversed by the instrument. The base,\r\nwhich is inclined at an angle of 45°, is an elliptical mirror, and the\r\ntop, of straight section, is open in order to permit the observer\r\nstanding at the mouth of the well, and provided with a powerful\r\nspyglass, to see in the mirror the image of the earth. The lamp is so\r\nmounted that its upwardly emitted rays are intercepted.\r\n\r\nThe whole apparatus is suspended from a long cable, formed of two\r\nconducting wires, which winds around a windlass with metallic\r\njournals which are electrically insulated. These journals communicate,\r\nthrough the intermedium of two friction springs, with the conductors\r\non the one hand and, on the other, with the poles of an automatic and\r\nportable battery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TROUVE ERYGMASCOPE.]\r\n\r\nThis permits of lowering and raising the apparatus at will, without\r\nderangement, and without its being necessary to interrupt the light\r\nand the observation.--_Revue Industrielle._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW ELECTRIC BALLISTIC TARGET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe electrical target usually employed in determining velocities of\r\nprojectiles consists of a wooden frame on which is strung a copper\r\nwire so as to make a continuous circuit arranged in parallel vertical\r\nlines about one inch or one and one half inches apart.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that a projectile will pass through this target\r\nwithout breaking the circuit, either by squeezing between the wires or\r\nbecause, when last repaired, the target was short-circuited unnoticed,\r\nso that the cutting of the wires did not break the circuit. The repair\r\nof this target takes considerable time.\r\n\r\n  _______________________________________________________\r\n |                                                       {\r\n |  +-------------__ --------------__----------------    }\r\n |  |   _      //    \\\\         //    \\\\             }   {\r\n |  |  |_|    || C_{0}  ||  A    ||  ||  ||     A      {   }\r\n |  |    P     \\\\    //         \\\\    //             }   {\r\n |  +-------------  ---------------  ----------------    }\r\n |                                  F                    {\r\n |_______________________________________________________}\r\n\r\n                           Plan.\r\n         P        C\r\n        =|=   _________\r\n       |===|  =========      A                A\r\n      ========|   | S |========\\_______/=================\r\n              |spring |        |       |\r\n              |   |   |        |       |\r\n              |S_ | __|        |__   __|\r\n                 |||              | |\r\n      ___________|||______________| |_____________________\r\n                  |\r\n                  |         Section.\r\n               H /\r\n                 \\+/\r\n                  |\r\n                  |\r\n                  |\r\n                  |\r\n                  |\r\n                  |\r\n             _____+_____\r\n            |           |\r\n            |     W     |\r\n            |           |\r\n            |___________|\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides these objections to this target, another and more serious one\r\nis the irregularity in the manner of breaking the circuit. It has been\r\nproved that times required for a flat headed and an ogival headed\r\nprojectile to rupture the current are very different.\r\n\r\nTo remedy these defects a new and very ingenious target has been\r\ndevised and used with great success at the United States Military\r\nAcademy at West Point. The top of the target is a wooden strip, F, on\r\nthe upper side of which are screwed strips of copper, A A, about 1/2\r\nin. wide, and 1/8 in. thick. The connection between two adjoining\r\nstrips is made by a copper cartridge, C, which is dropped in a hole in\r\nthe frame bored to receive it. This cartridge is the one used in the\r\nSpringfield rifle. Inside the cartridge is a spiral spring, S, which,\r\nacting on the bottom of the hole and the head of the cartridge, tends\r\nto make the latter spring up, and so break the circuit.\r\n\r\nTo the hook, H, which is attached to the cartridge, is suspended, by\r\nmeans of a string, the lead weight, W, thus drawing down the cartridge\r\nand making the circuit between A and A'. All the weights being\r\nsuspended the current comes in through the post, P, passes along the\r\ncopper strips and out of the corresponding post on the other end.\r\n\r\nOn firing the projectile cuts a string, and the spring at once causes\r\nthe cartridge to spring up, thus breaking the circuit.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for the projectile to squeeze between the strings\r\nand not break the current, for in so doing the cartridge is tipped\r\nslightly, which is sufficient, as it breaks the current on one side.\r\n\r\nThis target is used in connection with the Boulenge chronograph. Two\r\ntargets are established at a known distance apart, say 50 ft., and the\r\ntime required for the projectile to pass over this distance is\r\ndetermined by finding the difference in the time of cutting of the two\r\ntargets, by finding the difference in the time of falling of the two\r\nrods, caused by the demagnetization of two electromagnets in the same\r\ncircuit with the targets.\r\n\r\nBy means of a disjunctor both rods are dropped at the same time, the\r\nshorter one releasing a knife blade which makes a cut on the longer\r\none. Now both rods are hung from the magnets again and the gun is\r\nfired.\r\n\r\nThe projectile passes through the first target, breaks the circuit,\r\ndemagnetizes the magnet of the longer rod, and it begins to fall. On\r\npassing through the second target, the projectile causes the shorter\r\nrod to fall. This releases the knife blade, and a second cut is made.\r\nThe time corresponding to the distance between these cuts is the time\r\nthe longer rod was falling before the second rod began to fall or the\r\ntime between the cutting of the two targets by the projectile.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the cuts is measured, and the time corresponding\r\nto it can easily be found. Then the velocity of the projectile is\r\nequal to 50/t.\r\n\r\nTo repair this target, strings are prepared in advance of suitable\r\nlength and looped at both ends, so that by placing the hook of the\r\ncartridge in one loop and that of the weight in the other the repair\r\nis quickly made.\r\n\r\nThis target has been used on the West Point proving ground to\r\ndetermine velocities over distances of 100 ft. interval to distances\r\nof only 9 ft. interval, and has given most satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 786, page 12566.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLOOK FOR APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Address of Dr. C.V. Riley at the annual meeting of the\r\nAssociation of Economic Entomologists, Champaign, Ills., November 11\r\nto 14, 1890.]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of legislation in different countries that has of late\r\nyears been deemed necessary or sufficiently important, in view of\r\ninjurious insects, is a striking evidence of the increased attention\r\npaid to applied entomology; and while modern legislation of this kind\r\nhas been, on the whole, far more intelligent than similar efforts in\r\nyears gone by, many of the laws passed have nevertheless been unwise,\r\nfutile, and impracticable, and even unnecessarily oppressive to other\r\ninterests. The chief danger here is the intervention of politics or\r\npolitical methods. Expert counsel should guide our legislators and the\r\nsteps taken should be thorough in order to be effective. We have had\r\nof late years in Germany very good evidence of the excellent results\r\nflowing from thorough methods, and the recent legislation in\r\nMassachusetts against the gypsy moth (_Ocneria dispar_), which at one\r\ntime threatened to become farcical, has, fortunately, proved more than\r\nusually successful; the commission appointed to deal with the subject\r\nhaving worked with energy and followed competent advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION.\r\n\r\nOn the question of publication of the results of our labors it is\r\nperhaps premature to dwell at length. Each of the experiment stations\r\nis publishing its own bulletins and reports quite independently of the\r\nothers, but after a uniform plan recommended by the association with\r\nwhich we meet here; and with but one exception that has come to my\r\nnotice, another important recommendation of the same association--that\r\nthese publications shall be void of all personal matter--has been kept\r\nin mind. The National Bureau of Experiment Stations at Washington is\r\ndoing what it can with the means at command to further the general\r\nwork by issuing the Experiment Station Record, devoted chiefly to\r\ndigests of the State station bulletins. There is a serious question in\r\nmy mind as to the utility of State digests by the national department\r\nof results already published extensively by the different States and\r\ndistributed under government frank to all similar institutions and to\r\nwhomsoever is interested enough to ask for them.\r\n\r\nSuch digests may or may not be intelligently made, and, even under the\r\nmost favorable circumstances, will hardly serve any other purpose than\r\nhelping to the reference to the original articles, and this could\r\nundoubtedly be done more satisfactorily to the stations and to the\r\npeople at large by general and classified indices to all the State\r\ndocuments, made as full as possible and issued at stated intervals.\r\nOnly a small proportion of the bulletins have been so far noticed by\r\ndigest in this record, with no particular rule, so far as I can see,\r\nin the selection. In point of fact, those will be most apt to be\r\nnoticed whose authors can find time to themselves send or make for the\r\npurpose their own abstracts. This is, perhaps, inevitable under\r\npresent arrangements. Complete and satisfactory digests of all, if\r\nintelligent and critical, imply a far greater force than is at present\r\nat Prof. Atwater's command.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, it would seem wiser to devote all the\r\nenergies of the bureau to digests of the similar literature of other\r\ncountries, which would be of immense advantage to our people and to\r\nthe different station workers. Judging from the recommendations and\r\nresolutions of the general association, this is the view very\r\ngenerally held, but except in chemistry and special industries like\r\nthat of beet sugar, very little of that kind of work has yet been\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the station publications in general is equally true of\r\nspecial publications. As entomologist of the department, I have been\r\nurged to bring together, at stated intervals, digests of the\r\nentomological publications of the different stations. Such digests to\r\nbe of any value, however, should also be critical, and it were a\r\nthankless task for any one to be critic or censor even of that which\r\nneeds correction or criticism. Moreover, to do this work intelligently\r\nwould require increase of the divisional force, which at present is\r\nmore advantageously employed, for, as already intimated, I should have\r\ngreat doubts of the utility of these digests.\r\n\r\nI believe, however, that the division should strive for such increase\r\nof means as would justify the periodic publication, either\r\nindependently or as a part of the department record, of general and\r\nclassified indices to the entomological matter of the station\r\nbulletins, and should work more and more toward giving results from\r\nother parts of the world. This could, perhaps, best be done by titles\r\nof subject and of author so spaced and printed on stout paper that\r\nthey could be cut and used in the ordinary card catalogue. The\r\nrecipient could cut and systematically place the titles as fast as\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nAs to the character of the matter of the entomological bulletins, it\r\nwill inevitably be influenced by the needs and demands of the people\r\nof the respective States, and while originality should be kept in\r\nmind, there must needs be in the earlier years of the work much\r\nrestatement of what is already well known. That some results have been\r\npublished of work which reflects no particular credit upon our calling\r\nis a mere incident of the new positions created. Yet we may expect\r\nmarked improvement from year to year in this direction, and without\r\nbeing invidious, I would cite those of Prof. Gillette's on his\r\nspraying experiments and on the plum curculio and plum gouger, as\r\nmodels of what such bulletins should be.\r\n\r\nAlthough the resolution offered at our last meeting by Prof. Cook, to\r\nthe effect that purely descriptive matter should be excluded from the\r\nstation bulletins, met with no favor, but was laid on the table, by\r\nthe general association, I am in full sympathy with this position and\r\nam strongly of the opinion that in the ordinary bulletins such purely\r\ntechnical and descriptive matter should be reduced to the necessary\r\nminimum consistent with clearness of statement and accuracy, and that\r\nif it is desired, on the part of the station entomologists, to issue\r\ntechnical and descriptive papers, a separate series of bulletins were\r\nbetter instituted for this class of matter.\r\n\r\nFinally, for results which it is desired to promptly get before the\r\npeople, the agricultural press is at our disposal, and so far as the\r\nentomological work of the department of agriculture is concerned, the\r\nperiodical bulletin, _Insect Life_, was established for this purpose.\r\nIts columns are open to all station workers, and I would here appeal\r\nto the members of the association to help make it, as far as possible,\r\nnational, by sending brief notes and digests of their work as it\r\nprogresses. Hitherto we have been unable to make as much effort in\r\nthis direction as we desired, but in future it is our hope to make the\r\nbulletin, as far as possible, a national medium through which the\r\nresults of work done in all parts of the country may quickly be put on\r\nrecord and distributed, not only to all parts of our own country, but\r\nto all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth and development of the national department and the\r\nmultiplication of its divisions have necessitated special modes of\r\npublication and rendered the annual report almost an anachronism so\r\nfar as it pretends to be what it at one time was--a pretty complete\r\nreport of the scientific and other work of the department. The\r\nattempts which I have made through the proper authorities to get\r\nCongress to order more pretentious monographic works in quarto volume\r\nsimilar to those issued by other departments of the government have\r\nnot met with encouragement, and in this direction many of the stations\r\nwill, let us hope, be able to do better.\r\n\r\n\r\nCO-OPERATION.\r\n\r\nEvery other subject that might be considered on this occasion must be\r\nsubordinate to the one great question of co-operation. With the large\r\nincrease of actual workers in our favorite field, distributed all over\r\nthe country, the necessity for some co-operation and co-ordination\r\nmust be apparent to every one. Just how this should be brought about\r\nor in what direction we may work toward it, will be for this\r\nassociation in its deliberations to decide. Nor will I venture to\r\nanticipate the deliberations and conclusions of the special committee\r\nappointed to take the matter into consideration, beyond the statement\r\nthat there are many directions in which we can adopt plans for mutual\r\nbenefit. Take, for instance, the introduction and dissemination of\r\nparasites. How much greater will be the chance of success in any\r\nparticular case if we have all the different station entomologists\r\ninterested in some specific plan to be carried out in co-operation\r\nwith the national department, which ought to have better facilities of\r\nintroducing specimens to foreign countries or to different sections of\r\nour own country than any of the State stations.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the fruit growers of one section of the country,\r\ncomprising several States in area, need the benefit in their warfare\r\nagainst any particularly injurious insect of such natural enemy or\r\nenemies as are known to help the fruit growers of some other section.\r\nThere will certainly be much greater chances of success in the\r\ncarrying out of any scheme of introduction if all the workers in the\r\none section may be called upon through some central or national body\r\nto help in the introduction and disposition of the desired material\r\ninto the other section. Or, take the case of the boll worm\r\ninvestigation already alluded to. The chances of success would be much\r\ngreater if the entomologists in all the States interested were to give\r\nsome attention to such lepidopterous larvæ as are found to be affected\r\nwith contagious diseases and to follow out some specific plan of\r\ncultivating and transmitting them to the party or parties with whom\r\nthe actual trials are intrusted. The argument applies with still\r\ngreater force to any international efforts. I need hardly multiply\r\ninstances. There is, it is true, nothing to prevent any individual\r\nstation entomologist from requesting co-operation of the other\r\nstations, nor is there anything to prevent the national department\r\nfrom doing likewise; but in all organization results are more apt to\r\nflow from the power to direct rather than from mere liberty to request\r\nor to plead. The station entomologist may be engrossed in some line of\r\nresearch which he deems of more importance to the people of his State,\r\nand may resent being called upon to divert his energies; and with no\r\ncentral or national power to decide upon plans of co-operation for the\r\ncommon weal, we are left to voluntary methods, mutually devised, and\r\nit is here that this association can, it seems to me, most fully\r\njustify its organization. And this brings me to the question of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTMENT AND THE STATIONS.\r\n\r\nImmediately connected with the question of co-operation is the\r\nrelation of the National Department of Agriculture and the State\r\nexperiment stations. The relation, instead of being vital and\r\nauthoritative, is, in reality, a subordinate one. Many persons\r\ninterested in the advancement of agriculture foresaw the advantage of\r\nhaving experiment stations attached to the State agricultural colleges\r\nfounded under the Morrill act of 1862; but I think that in the minds\r\nof most persons the establishment of these stations implied some such\r\nconnection with the national department as that outlined in an address\r\non Agricultural Advancement in the United States, which I had the\r\nhonor to deliver in 1879 before the National Agricultural Congress, at\r\nRochester, and in which the following language was used:\r\n\r\n  \"In the light of the past history of the German experimental\r\n  stations and their work, or of that in our own State of\r\n  Connecticut, the expediency of purchasing an experimental farm of\r\n  large dimensions in the vicinity of Washington is very\r\n  questionable. There can be no doubt, however, of the value of a\r\n  good experimental station there that shall have its branches in\r\n  every State of the Union. The results to flow from such stations\r\n  will not depend upon the number of acres at command, and it will\r\n  be far wiser and more economical for the commissioner to make each\r\n  agricultural college that accepted the government endowment\r\n  auxiliary to the national bureau, so that the experimental farm\r\n  that is now, or should be, connected with each of these\r\n  institutions might be at its service and under the general\r\n  management of the superintendent of the main station. There is\r\n  reason to believe that the directors of these colleges would\r\n  cheerfully have them constituted as experimental stations under\r\n  the direction of the department, and thus help to make it really\r\n  national--the head of a vast system that should ramify through all\r\n  parts of the land....\r\n\r\n  \"With the different State agricultural colleges, and the State\r\n  agricultural societies, or boards, we have every advantage for\r\n  building up a national bureau of agriculture worthy of the country\r\n  and its vast productive interests, and on a thoroughly economical\r\n  basis, such as that of Prussia, for instance.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, the view in mind was something in the nature of that which\r\nhas since been adopted by our neighbors of the North, where there is a\r\ncentral or national station or farm at Ottawa and sub-stations or\r\nbranch farms at Nappan, Nova Scotia, Brandon, Manitoba, Indian Head,\r\nN.W.T., and Agassiz, British Columbia, all under the able direction of\r\nMr. William Saunders, one of our esteemed fellow workers. It was my\r\nprivilege to be a good deal with Mr. Saunders when he was in Europe\r\nstudying the experience of other countries in this matter, and the\r\npolicy finally adopted in Canada as a result of his labors is an\r\neminently wise one, preventing some of the difficulties and dangers\r\nwhich beset our plan, whether as between State and nation or college\r\nand station.\r\n\r\nUnder the present laws and with the vast influence which the\r\nAssociation of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations will\r\nwield, both in Congress and in the different States, there is great\r\ndanger of transposition, in this agricultural body politic, of those\r\nparts which in the animal body are denominated head and tail, and the\r\nold saw to the effect that \"the dog wags the tail because the tail\r\ncannot wag the dog,\" will find another application. So far as the law\r\ngoes, the national department, which should hold a truly national\r\nposition toward State agricultural institutions depending on federal\r\nsupport, can do little except by suggestion, whether in the line of\r\ndirecting plans or in any way co-ordinating or controlling the work of\r\nthe different stations throughout the country. The men who influenced\r\nand shaped the legislation which resulted in the Hatch bill were\r\ncareful that the department's function should be to indicate, not to\r\ndictate; to advise and assist, not to govern or regulate. We have,\r\ntherefore, to depend on such relationships and such plans of\r\nco-operation as will appear advantageous to all concerned, and these\r\ncan best be brought about through such associations as are now in\r\nconvention here.\r\n\r\nWithout such plans there is great danger of such waste of energy and\r\nmeans and duplication of results as will bring the work into popular\r\ndisfavor and invite disintegration, for already there is a growing\r\nfeeling that agricultural experiment is and will be subordinated to\r\nthe ordinary college work in the disposition of the federal\r\nappropriations.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the national department as a whole in its connection\r\nwith the State stations is true in a greater or less degree of the\r\ndifferent divisions of the department in connection with the different\r\nspecialists of the stations. With the multiplicity of workers in any\r\ngiven direction in the different States, the necessity for national\r\nwork lessens. A favorite scheme of mine in the past, for instance (and\r\none I am glad to say fully indorsed by Prof. Willits), was to endeavor\r\nto have a permanent agent located in every section of the country that\r\nwas sufficiently distinctive in its agricultural resources and\r\nclimate, or, as a yet further elaboration of the same plan, one in\r\neach of the more important agricultural States. The necessity for such\r\nState agents has been lessened, if not obviated, by the Hatch bill,\r\nand the subsequent modifications looking to permanent appropriations\r\nto the State stations or colleges, which give no central power at\r\nWashington. The question then arises, What function shall the national\r\ndepartment perform? Its influence and field for usefulness have been\r\nlessened rather than augmented in the lines of actual investigation in\r\nvery many directions. Many a State is already far better equipped both\r\nas to valuable surrounding land, laboratory and library facilities,\r\nmore liberal salaries, and greater freedom from red tape,\r\nadministrative routine, and restrictions as to expenditures, than we\r\nare at Washington; and, except as a directing agent and a useful\r\nservant, I cannot see where the future growth of the department's\r\ninfluence is to be outside of those federal functions which are\r\nexecutive. Just what that directing influence is to be is the question\r\nof the hour, not only in the broader but in the special sense. The\r\nsame question, in a narrower sense, had arisen in the case of the few\r\nStates which employed State entomologists. In the event, for instance,\r\nof an outbreak of some injurious insect, or in the event of any\r\nparticular economic entomological question within the limits of the\r\nState having such an officer, the United States entomologist would\r\nnaturally feel that any effort on his part would be unnecessary, or\r\nmight even be looked upon as an interference. He would feel that there\r\nwas always danger of mere duplication of observation or experiment,\r\nexcept where appealed to for aid or co-operation. This is, perhaps,\r\ntrue only of insects which are local or sectional, and is rather a\r\nnarrow view of the matter, but it is one brought home from experience,\r\nand is certainly to be considered in our future plans. The favor with\r\nwhich the museum work of the national division was viewed by you at\r\nthe meeting last November and the amount of material sent on for\r\ndetermination would indicate that the building up of a grand national\r\nreference collection will be most useful to the station workers. But\r\nto do this satisfactorily we need your co-operation, and I appeal to\r\nall entomologists to aid in this effort by sending duplicates of their\r\ntypes to Washington, and thus more fully insuring against ultimate\r\nloss thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUS OF OUR SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThis train of thought brings up the question of the status of our\r\nsociety with the station entomologists as represented by the committee\r\nof the general association. Those of us who had desired a national\r\nassociation for the various purposes for which such associations are\r\nformed, felt, I believe, if I may speak for them, that the creation of\r\nthe different experimental stations rendered such an organization\r\nfeasible. Your organization at Toronto and the constitution adopted\r\nand amended at the meeting at Washington all indicate that the chief\r\nobject was the advancement of our chosen work and that the strength of\r\nthe association would come from the experiment station entomologists.\r\nThere was then no other organization of the kind, nor any intimation\r\nthat such a one would be founded. Some of us therefore were surprised\r\nto learn from the circular sent out by Prof. Forbes, its chairman,\r\nthat the committee appointed by the association of agricultural\r\ncolleges and experiment stations, and through which we had hoped to\r\ncommunicate and co-operate with that association, was not in the\r\nproper sense a committee, but a section which has prepared (and in\r\nfact was required by the executive committee and the rules of the\r\nsuperior body to prepare) a programme of papers and discussions for\r\nthe meeting to be held at the same time and place with our own. I\r\ncannot but feel that this is in some respects a misfortune, and it\r\nwill devolve upon you to decide upon several questions of importance\r\nthat will materially affect our future existence. That there is not\r\nroom for two national organizations having the same objects in view\r\nand meeting at the same time and place goes, I think, without saying;\r\nand if the committee of the general association is to be anything more\r\nthan a committee in the proper sense of the word, or if it is to\r\nassume with or without formal constitution the functions of our own\r\nassociation, then our own must necessarily be crippled, and to do any\r\ngood at all must meet at a different time and a different place. A\r\ncommittee or section, or whatever it may be called, of the general\r\nassociation with which we meet, would preclude active membership of\r\nany but those who come within the constitution of that body. Our\r\nCanadian friends and many others who have identified themselves with\r\napplied entomology, and do not belong to any of our State or\r\ngovernment institutions, would be debarred from active representation,\r\nhowever liberal the association may have been in inviting such to\r\nparticipate, without power to vote in its deliberations. Our own\r\nassociation has, or should have, no such limitations. Some of us who\r\nare entitled to membership in both bodies may feel indifferent as to\r\nthe course finally decided upon, and that it will not make any\r\ndifference whether we have an outside and independent organization, as\r\nthat of the association of official chemists, or whether we do, as did\r\nthe botanists and horticulturists, waive independence in favor of more\r\ndirect connection with the general association, provided there is some\r\nway whereby the committees of the general association are given\r\nsufficient latitude and time to properly present their papers and\r\ndeliberate; but there are others who feel more sensitive as to their\r\naction and are more immediately influenced by the feelings of the main\r\nbody. I hope that whatever action be taken at this meeting, the\r\ngeneral good and the promotion of economic entomology will be kept in\r\nmind and that no sectional or personal feeling will be allowed to\r\ninfluence our deliberations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION AND COMMENT.\r\n\r\nYou will, I know, pardon me if, before concluding these remarks, I\r\nventure to make a few comments which, though not altogether agreeable,\r\nare made in all sincerity and in the hope of doing good. The question\r\nas to how far purely technical and especially descriptive and\r\nmonographic work should be done by the different stations or by the\r\nnational department is one which I have already alluded to and upon\r\nwhich we shall probably hold differing opinions, and which will be\r\nsettled according to the views of the authorities at the different\r\nstations. Individually, I have ever felt that one ostensibly engaged\r\nin applied entomology and paid by the State or national government to\r\nthe end that he may benefit the agricultural community can be true to\r\nhis trust only by largely overcoming the pleasure of entomological\r\nwork having no practical bearing. I would, therefore, draw the line at\r\ndescriptive work except where it is incidental to the economic work\r\nand for the purpose of giving accuracy to the popular and economic\r\nstatements. This would make our work essentially biological, for all\r\nbiologic investigation would be justified, not only because the life\r\nhabits of any insect, once ascertained, throw light on those of\r\nspecies which are closely related to it, but because we can never know\r\nwhen a species at present harmless may subsequently prove harmful, and\r\nhave to be classed among the species injurious to agriculture.\r\n\r\nOn the question of credit to their original sources of results already\r\non record, it is hardly necessary for me to advise, because good sense\r\nand the consensus of opinion will in the end justify or condemn a\r\nwriter according as he prove just and conscientious in this regard.\r\n\r\nThere is one principle that should guide every careful writer, viz.,\r\nthat in any publications whatever, where facts or opinions are put\r\nforth, it should always be made clear as to which are based upon the\r\nauthor's personal experience and which are compiled or stated upon the\r\nauthority of others. We should have no patience with a very common\r\ntendency to set forth facts, even those relating to the most common\r\nand best known species, without the indications to which I have\r\nreferred. The tendency belittles our calling and is generally\r\nmisleading and confusing, especially for bibliographic work, and\r\ncannot be too strongly deprecated.\r\n\r\nOn this point there will hardly be any difference of opinion, but I\r\nwill allude to another question of credit upon which there prevails a\r\ngood deal of loose opinion and custom. It is the habit of using\r\nillustrations of other authors without any indication of their\r\noriginal source.\r\n\r\nThis is an equally vicious custom and one to be condemned, though I\r\nknow that some have fallen into the habit, without appreciation of its\r\nevil effect. It is, in my judgment, almost as blameworthy as to use\r\nthe language or the facts of another without citing the authority.\r\n\r\nEvery member of this association who has due appreciation of the time\r\nand labor and special knowledge required to produce a good and true\r\nillustration of the transformations and chief characteristics of an\r\ninsect will appreciate this criticism. However pardonable in fugitive\r\nnewspaper articles in respect of cuts which, from repeated use, have\r\nbecome common or which have no individuality, the habit inevitably\r\ngives a certain spurious character to more serious and official\r\npublications, for assumption of originality, whether intended or not,\r\ngoes with uncredited matter whether of text or figure. Nor is mere\r\nacknowledgment of loan or purchase to the publisher, institution or\r\nindividual who may own the block or stone what I refer to. But that\r\nacknowledgment to the author of the figure or the work in which it\r\nfirst appears which is part of conscientious writing, and often a\r\nvaluable index as to the reliability of the figure.\r\n\r\nIt were supererogation to point out to a body of this kind the value\r\nof the most careful and thorough work in connection with life\r\nhistories and habits, often involving as it does much microscopic\r\nstudy of structure. The officers of our institutions who control the\r\nfunds, and more or less fully our conduct, are apt to be somewhat\r\nimpatient and inappreciative of the time given to anatomic work, and\r\nwhere it is given for the purpose of describing species and of\r\nsynopsizing or monographing higher groups, without reference to\r\nagriculture, I am firmly of the belief that it diverts one from\r\neconomic work, but where pursued for a definite economic purpose it\r\ncannot be too careful or too thorough and I know of no instances\r\nbetter calculated to appeal to and modify the views of those inclined\r\nto belittle such structural study than Phylloxera and Icerya. On the\r\ncareful comparison of the European and American specimens of\r\n_Phylloxera vastatrix_, involving the most minute structures and\r\ndetails, depended originally those important economic questions which\r\nhave resulted in legislation by many different nations and the\r\nregeneration of the affected vineyards of Europe, of our own Pacific\r\ncoast, and of other parts of the world by the use of American\r\nresistant stocks. In the case of _Icerya purchasi_ the possibilities\r\nof success in checking it by its natural enemies hung at one time upon\r\na question of specific difference between it and the _Icerya sacchari_\r\nof Signoret--a question of minute structure which the descriptions\r\nleft unsettled and which could only be settled by the most careful\r\nstructural study and the comparison of the types, involving a trip to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nI have thus touched, gentlemen, upon a few of the many subjects that\r\ncrowd upon the mind for consideration on an occasion like this--a few\r\ngleanings from a field which is passing rich in promise and\r\npossibility. It is a field that some of us have cultivated for many\r\nyears and yet have only scratched the surface, and if I have ventured\r\nto suggest or admonish, it is with the feeling that my own labors in\r\nthis field are ere long about to end and that I may not have another\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nAt no time in the history of the world has there, I trow, been\r\ngathered together such a body of devoted and capable workers in\r\napplied entomology. It marks an era in our calling and, looking back\r\nat the progress of the past fifteen years, we may well ponder the\r\npossibilities of the next fifteen. They will be fruitful of grand\r\nresults in proportion as we persistently and combinedly pursue the yet\r\nunsolved problems and are not tempted to the immediate presentation of\r\nseparate facts, which are so innumerable and so easily observed that\r\ntheir very wealth becomes an element of weakness. Epoch-making\r\ndiscoveries result only from this power of following up unswervingly\r\nany given problem, or any fixed ideal. The kerosene emulsion, the\r\nCyclone nozzle, the history of _Phylloxera vastatrix_, of _Phorodon\r\nhumuli_, of _Vedalia cardinalis_, are illustrations in point, and\r\nwhile we may not expect frequent results as striking or of as wide\r\napplication as these, there is no end of important problems yet to be\r\nsolved and from the solution of which we may look for similar\r\nbeneficial results. Applied entomology is often considered a sordid\r\npursuit, but it only becomes so when the object is sordid. When\r\npursued with unselfish enthusiasm born of the love of investigation\r\nand the delight in benefiting our fellow men, it is inspiring, and\r\nthere are few pursuits more deservedly so, considering the vast losses\r\nto our farmers from insect injury and the pressing need that the\r\ndistressed husbandman has for every aid that can be given him. Our\r\nwork is elevating in its sympathies for the struggles and suffering of\r\nothers. Our standard should be high--the pursuit of knowledge for the\r\nadvancement of agriculture. No official entomologist should lower it\r\nby sordid aims.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent political campaign the farmer must have been sorely\r\npuzzled to know whether his interests needed protection or not. On the\r\nabstract question of tariff protection to his products we, as\r\nentomologists, may no more agree than do the politicians or than does\r\nthe farmer himself. But ours is a case of protection from injurious\r\ninsects, and upon that there can nowhere be division of opinion. It is\r\nour duty to see that he gets it with as little tax for the means as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASH SALTS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: By John B. Smith, entomologist. Potash as an insecticide is\r\nnot entirely new, but has never been brought out with the prominence I\r\nthink it deserves.--_N.J. Ag. Col. Exp. St., Bulletin 75._]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy attention was attracted to potash salts as an insecticide, by the\r\ncasual remark of an intelligent farmer, that washing his young pear\r\ntrees with a muriate of potash solution cleared them of scales. The\r\nvalue of this substance for insecticide purposes, should its powers be\r\nsufficient, struck me at once, and I began investigation. It was\r\nunluckily too late in the season for field experiments of the nature\r\ndesired; but it is the uniform testimony of farmers who have used\r\neither the muriate or the kainit in the cornfields, that they have\r\nthere no trouble with grubs or cut worms. Mr. E.B. Voorhees, the\r\nsenior chemist of the station, assures me that on his father's farm\r\nthe fields were badly infested, and replanting cornhills killed by\r\ngrubs or wire worms was a recognized part of the programme. Since\r\nusing the potash salts, however, they have had absolutely no trouble,\r\nand even their previously worst-infested fields show no further trace\r\nof injury. The same testimony comes from others, and I feel safe in\r\nrecommending these salts, preferably kainit, to those who are troubled\r\nwith cut worms or wire worms in corn.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\nA lot of wire worms (_Iulus_ sp.) brought in from potato hills were\r\nput into a tin can with about three inches of soil and some potato\r\ncuttings, and the soil was thoroughly moistened with kainit, one ounce\r\nto one pint of water. Next morning all the specimens were dead. A\r\ncheck lot in another can, moistened with water only, were healthy and\r\nlived for some days afterward.\r\n\r\nA number of cabbage maggots placed on the soil impregnated with the\r\nsolution died within twelve hours.\r\n\r\nTo test its actual killing power, used the solution, one ounce kainit\r\nto one pint water, to spray a rose bush badly infested with plant\r\nlice. Effect, all the lice dead ten hours later; the younger forms\r\nwere dropping within an hour.\r\n\r\nSprayed several heads of wheat with the solution, and within three\r\nhours all the aphides infesting them were dead.\r\n\r\nSome experiments on hairy caterpillars resulted unsatisfactorily, the\r\nhair serving as a perfect protection against the spray, even from the\r\natomizer.\r\n\r\nTo test its effect on the foliage, sprayed some tender shoots of rose\r\nand grape leaves, blossoms, and clusters of young fruit. No bad effect\r\nobservable 24 hours later. There was on some of the leaves a fine\r\nglaze of salt crystals, and a decided salt taste was manifest on all.\r\n\r\nMuriate of potash of the same strength was tested as follows: Sprayed\r\non some greenhouse camellias badly infested by mealy bugs, it killed\r\nnearly all within three hours, and six hours later not a living insect\r\nwas found. The plants were entirely uninjured by the application.\r\n\r\nThoroughly sprayed some rose bushes badly infested with aphides, and\r\ncarried off some of the worst branches. On these the lice were dead\r\nnext morning; but on the bushes the effect was not so satisfactory,\r\nmost of the winged forms and many mature wingless specimens were\r\nunaffected, while the terminal shoots and very young leaves were\r\ndrooping as though frosted. All, however, recovered later.\r\n\r\nThe same experiment repeated on other, hardier roses, resulted\r\nsimilarly so far as the effect on the aphides was concerned, but there\r\nwas no injury to the plant.\r\n\r\nUsed this same mixture on the caterpillars of _Orgyia leucostigma_\r\nwith unsatisfactory effect, and with the same results used it on a\r\nnumber of other larvæ. Used on the rose leaf roller, _Cacæcia\r\nrosaceana_, it was promptly effective.\r\n\r\nTested for injury to plants, it injured the foliage and flowers of\r\nwisteria, the younger leaves of maple and grape, and the finer kinds\r\nof roses.\r\n\r\nFrom these few experiments kainit seems preferable to the muriate, as\r\nacting more effectively on insects and not injuriously on plants. For\r\ngeneral use on plants it is not to be recommended. It is otherwise on\r\nunderground species, where the soil will be penetrated by the salts\r\nand where the moisture evaporates but slowly, and the salt has a\r\nlonger and better chance to act. The best method of application would\r\nbe a broadcasting in fertilizing quantity before or during a rain, so\r\nas to carry the material into the soil at once. In cornfields infested\r\nwith grubs or wire worms, the application should be made before\r\nplanting. Where it is to be used to reach root lice, it should be used\r\nwhen the injury is beginning. When strawberry beds are infested by the\r\nwhite grub, the application should be made when cultivating or before\r\nsetting out.\r\n\r\nThe potash salts have a high value as fertilizers, and any application\r\nmade will act as a stimulant as well as insecticide, thus enabling the\r\nplants to overcome the insect injury as well as destroying the insect.\r\n\r\nIn speaking on this subject in Salem county, I learned from farmers\r\npresent that those using potash were not troubled with the corn root\r\nlouse to any extent, and also that young peach trees have been\r\nsuccessfully grown in old lice-infested orchards, where previously all\r\ndied, by first treating the soil with kainit of potash.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA meteorological station has been built on Mont Blanc, at an elevation\r\nof 13,300 feet, under the direction of M. Vallot. It required six\r\nweeks to deliver the materials. The instruments are self-registering\r\nand are to be visited in summer every fifteen days if possible, the\r\ninstruments being left to register between the visits. In the winter\r\nthe observatory will be entirely inaccessible. This is the highest\r\nscientific station in Europe, but is 847 feet lower than the Pike's\r\nPeak station in Colorado.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXPENSE MARGIN IN LIFE INSURANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principle of mutuality requires that the burden of expense in life\r\ninsurance should be borne by all the members equally; but, even with\r\nthe most careful adjustment, the allowance usually made is\r\nconsiderably in excess of what is needed in the regular companies\r\ndoing business on the \"level premium\" plan.\r\n\r\nIt is customary in these companies to add to the net premium a\r\npercentage thereof to cover the expense account. This practice, though\r\nin harmony with the \"commission system,\" is so clearly defective and\r\nso far removed from the spirit of life insurance mathematics, that it\r\nscarcely deserves even this passing notice.\r\n\r\nIt is generally understood that these corporations combine the\r\nfunctions of the savings bank and life insurance company, and it is\r\nonly by separating the two in our minds as far as possible that we can\r\nobtain a clear conception of the laws that should govern the\r\napportionment of the expenses among the great variety of policies.\r\n\r\nWhile it is a comparatively simple matter to state the amount of\r\neither the insurance or savings bank element in a single policy, it is\r\nby no means easy, as things go, to classify the company's actual\r\nexpenses on this basis.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we can pretty accurately determine what these amounts\r\nshould be in any particular case.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there are institutions in our midst devoted solely\r\nto receiving and conserving small sums of money; doing, in fact,\r\nexactly what our insurance companies are undertaking to do with the\r\nreserve and contributions thereto. These savings banks are required by\r\nlaw to make returns to the State commissioner, from whose official\r\nreport we can get a very good idea of the expense attendant on doing\r\nthis business.\r\n\r\nConfining ourselves to the city banks, where the conditions more\r\nnearly resemble those of the insurance companies, we find in\r\nthirty-eight combined institutions for saving in the State of\r\nMassachusetts a deposit in 1888 of $192,174,566, taken care of at an\r\naggregate cost of $455,387, or about 24-100 of one per cent.\r\n\r\nThe same ratio carried out for all the savings banks in Massachusetts\r\ngives a trifle over 25-100 of one per cent.; we may, therefore,\r\nconsider ¼ of one per cent. as expressing pretty nearly the cost of\r\nreceiving, paying out, and investing the savings of the people.\r\n\r\nWe must remember in this connection that in the popular estimation,\r\nthe savings bank is an important factor in the public welfare, and in\r\nthe towns and smaller cities there are often found public spirited men\r\nwilling to give their services to encourage this mode of saving; but\r\npublic sentiment has not yet given to life insurance the place which\r\nit is destined, sooner or later, to occupy by the side of the savings\r\nbank. Hence the services of able managers can only be obtained by a\r\nliberal outlay of the corporate funds. A satisfactory adjustment of\r\nthe matter of expenses will, perhaps, do more than anything else to\r\nbring about this recognition on the part of the public.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the savings bank it is safe to say that for double the\r\npresent outlay a liberal salary could be paid to all the officers.\r\nFollowing the analogy, we are led to infer that if this be the case in\r\nsavings banks, then ½ of one per cent. of the reserve should be an\r\nample allowance for the special labor required in the purely banking\r\nportion of the business.\r\n\r\nIn this we have the concurrence of the late Elizur Wright. In an essay\r\non this subject he says:\r\n\r\n  \"The expenses of the five largest savings banks in Boston, in\r\n  1869, did not exceed 4-10 of one per cent. on $28,000,000\r\n  deposited in them. They certainly had twice as many transactions,\r\n  in proportion to the deposits, as any life insurance company could\r\n  have with the same amount of reserve, so that ½ of one per cent.\r\n  on the reserve seems to be ample for all working expenses save\r\n  those of maintaining the agencies and collecting the premiums.\"\r\n\r\nThis need hardly be looked upon as an admission that it costs twice as\r\nmuch to care for the funds of a life insurance company as for those of\r\na savings bank. A liberal expense allowance must be made at the\r\noutset, seeing that an error in this particular cannot easily be\r\nrectified after the policy is issued. The dividend, or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, the annual return of surplus, will correct any overpayment\r\non this account.\r\n\r\nThere is another expense which seems inevitable. This is the\r\ngovernment tax on insurance companies, amounting in the aggregate to\r\nnearly 1/3 of one per cent. on the reserve.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that these institutions are intended to encourage\r\nthrift and to relieve the community from the care of numberless widows\r\nand orphans, it seems a clear violation of the principles of political\r\neconomy to levy a tax on this business; still, whatever our opinion\r\nmay be as to the justice or injustice of the imposition, the tax is\r\nmaintained and must be provided for. Consequently a further allowance\r\nof ½ of one per cent. must be added to the net premium to cover the\r\nsame, making a total of 1 per cent. of the reserve for banking\r\nexpenses and taxes. Considering this point as settled for the time\r\nbeing, let us proceed to investigate the insurance expenses.\r\n\r\nHere, again, we are fortunate in being able to refer to the official\r\nreports of a class of corporations doing nearly, if not quite pure\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\nThe assessment societies, outside of the fraternal and benevolent,\r\nreporting in 1889 to the insurance commissioner of Massachusetts, show\r\noutstanding risks amounting to $733,515,366. Losses to the amount of\r\n$7,270,238 were paid during the year at a cost for transacting the\r\nbusiness of $2,403,053, which includes among other items \"agency\r\nexpenses and commissions,\" which amount to about $1,203,000, or 17 per\r\ncent. of the cost value of the insurance actually done. It would seem\r\nas if an allowance of 20 per cent. would be a liberal one in the case\r\nof the regular companies, which surely have as good facilities for\r\ndoing business as the assessment societies.\r\n\r\nAs far as insurance is concerned, there is less difference between\r\nregular and co-operative companies than is generally supposed. Regular\r\ncompanies assess each policy in advance for a year's insurance at a\r\ntime, while co-operative societies furnish insurance only from one\r\nassessment to another. The difficulty in the way of collecting the\r\nassessment in the latter case would seem to be greater than in the\r\nformer, owing to the more permanent nature of the regular insurance\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nIn compensating agents the assessment companies naturally pay in\r\nproportion to the insurance obtained, inasmuch as there is no other\r\nbasis to go upon, but regular companies usually pay the agent a\r\npercentage of the premium _which includes a considerable trust fund_\r\nover and above the assessment for actual insurance. It is easily seen\r\nthat by the last method the agent's compensation increases in\r\nproportion to the amount of savings bank business forced upon the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nTo realize how far we are from anything like a scientific, not to say\r\ncommon sense basis for insurance expenses, we have but to examine the\r\nfollowing list, which gives the ratios between the expenditures for\r\ngeneral expenses in 1889, and those for the extension of the business.\r\nFor every $100 used in a general way, the different companies spend\r\nfor commissions and agency expenses: $37, $66, $67, $78, $91, $106,\r\n$110, $113, $120, $140, $157, $161, $173, $175, $186, $189, $200,\r\n$202, $222, $264, $311, $346.\r\n\r\nIt will doubtless be said that I am taking a very advanced position\r\nwhen I say that in the ideal life insurance scheme there is no place\r\nfor the commission system. Solicitors will be a necessity only so long\r\nas they are in the field, but fifty years of life insurance has taught\r\nour community its true value and, thanks to the modern press, the\r\ninstitution it is no more likely to fall into desuetude than is\r\nChristianity or the moral law.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of bringing the company to the individual, the\r\nlatter should be willing to pay a fee. The man who renders another a\r\nservice or puts his superior knowledge at another's disposal should\r\nlook to the party benefited for his remuneration. Any compensation\r\ngiven for such service to a go-between by a mutual company is paid by\r\nall, and the question arises, Is the advantage to the company of\r\nsufficient importance to warrant the imposition of this tax upon all\r\nits members promiscuously? The following, from the Massachusetts\r\nInsurance Commissioner's Report for 1885, leaves no doubt as to the\r\nconvictions of the writer on this important matter:\r\n\r\n  \"The expensiveness of the life insurance policy is not because the\r\n  level net premium is too high, for the premium is absolutely just,\r\n  and the policy holder gets full value; but the complaint justly\r\n  applies to the excessive expense charge. A person who wants\r\n  insurance, life or fire or other, should be able to buy it at\r\n  first cost without paying tribute of profits to middlemen. To that\r\n  complexion the matter will finally be brought by the force of\r\n  intelligent opinion, whatever resistance may be opposed by persons\r\n  whose thrift lies in the perpetuation of the expensive system now\r\n  in fashion.\"\r\n\r\nIt requires but a slight degree of prophetic vision to predict that in\r\na very few years the companies in self defense will be obliged to\r\nchange their method of compensating agents.\r\n\r\nSeveral companies have already begun the reform by grading\r\ncommissions; granting a percentage proportional to the amount of\r\ninsurance likely to be done on the policy. Other companies have simply\r\nreduced the amount of the commission rate, thus virtually withdrawing\r\nfrom active competition.\r\n\r\nThis will, in a certain degree, explain the wide variation in the\r\nfigures given above, where it is noticed that, in five companies out\r\nof twenty-two, the total agency expenditures amount to less than the\r\ngeneral expenses, while in six cases the companies spend more than\r\ndouble as much on the former as on the latter. In either class we find\r\nrepresentatives of the five largest companies in the country.\r\n\r\nOn applying the foregoing ratios to the business of the existing\r\ncompanies we find that, calling the theoretical expenses $100, the\r\nactual expenditures for 1889 were as follows: $112.67, $118.34,\r\n$150.40, $194.48, $208.16, $208.53, $228.66, $235.89, $248.44,\r\n$250.79, $258.33, $258.57, $265.14, $267.19, $267.92, $274.47,\r\n$294.17, $314.96, $335.70, $377.94, $616.70.\r\n\r\nIn this discouraging exhibit there is one ray of comfort. The combined\r\nassets of the two companies heading the list amount to over\r\n$100,000,000. There is no question as to their financial standing, and\r\nboth show a large increase in membership over the previous year. I may\r\nalso say here that it is a difficult matter to get at the actual \"cost\r\nof insurance\" in the various companies. Many of them, on their own\r\nacknowledgment, do not compute the advance cost of carrying their\r\n\"amount at risk,\" and others, for reasons of their own, do not care to\r\nstate the figures. In cases where the correct figures were not\r\nobtainable, I have assumed the cost to have been 1-1/3 per cent. of\r\nthe mean amount at risk.\r\n\r\nIf we should, in our comparison, omit the actual agency expenses and\r\ncommissions, the ratios would stand as follows:\r\n\r\nWhere I would allow $100 the companies actually used: $43.17, $55.90,\r\n$65.21, $77.21, $82.39, $88.34, $91.99. $91.98. $92.19, $94.65,\r\n$97.15. $99.55. $99.11. $102.86, $109.35, $125.05, $133.03, $141.92,\r\n$195.90, $207.06, $287.72.\r\n\r\nAs might be supposed, the first two ratios are those companies before\r\nalluded to. These companies might have doubled their advertising\r\naccount and expended $300,000 between them on agents' salaries, and\r\nstill have kept within my allowance.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, for the present at least, the reasonableness of the\r\nproposed allowance for the expenses of the banking and insurance\r\ndepartments of the business, we have before us the problem how to\r\nequitably adjust the burden among the great variety of policies.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, _there should be no policy in the company that\r\ndoes not contribute its proportionate share of the expense allowance\r\nduring every year of its life_. I make a special point of this, for at\r\npresent the policies which have become paid up, either by the payment\r\nof a single premium at the outset or by the completion of a stipulated\r\nnumber of payments, contribute practically nothing to the expense\r\naccount after the premium payments cease.\r\n\r\nThe following plan, I think, complies with all the requirements of the\r\nproblem. By the proposed method every policy, at all stages of its\r\nexistence, contributes its exact share to the expense fund, whatever\r\nits plan of payment may be.\r\n\r\nLet us, as an illustration, examine the case of a ten year endowment\r\npolicy, taken out at age 30, and consider it under three aspects,\r\nfirst, as paid for in advance by a single payment, second, as paid by\r\nfive annual payments, and third, as paid for annually throughout the\r\nterm. I have used this short term endowment policy simply for\r\nconvenience, the rule applying equally to policies of longer term or\r\nto the ordinary life policy, which is, in fact, an endowment policy\r\npayable at death or age 100.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The expense allowance on a plain life policy for $1,000,\r\ntaken at age 33, would be about $5.29; net premium (com. ex. 4 per\r\ncent.), $18.04; total office premium, $23.33; present rate $24.10.]\r\n\r\nTaking the case of the single premium endowment policy for $1,000, we\r\nfind that the following sums are required, each year to provide for\r\nthe care of the reserve and to pay the government fees (1 per cent. of\r\nreserve):\r\n\r\n  1st year    $6.9982 | 6th year       $8.4136\r\n  2d   \"       7.2560 | 7th  \"          8.7381\r\n  3d   \"       7.5258 | 8th  \"          9.0781\r\n  4th  \"       7.8082 | 9th  \"          9.4346\r\n  5th  \"       8.1039 | 10th \"          9.8086\r\n\r\nThe insurance expenses should be covered by the 20 per cent. allowance\r\ngiven below:\r\n\r\n  1st year    $ .4422 | 6th year       $ .2566\r\n  2d   \"        .4100 | 7th  \"           .2076\r\n  3d   \"        .3762 | 8th  \"           .1556\r\n  4th  \"        .3402 | 9th  \"           .0988\r\n  5th  \"        .2996 | 10th \"           .0344\r\n\r\nConsequently the total contribution required from this policy each\r\nyear is:\r\n\r\n  1st year    $7.4404 | 6th year       $8.6702\r\n  2d   \"       7.6660 | 7th  \"          8.9457\r\n  3d   \"       7.9020 | 8th  \"          9.2337\r\n  4th  \"       8.1484 | 9th  \"          9.5334\r\n  5th  \"       8.4034 | 10th \"          9.8430\r\n\r\nThe present value of all these contributions is found to be, at 4 per\r\ncent. interest, $71.6394; in other words, this sum paid at the outset,\r\nprovides a fund from which we may deduct the current expenses of each\r\nyear in advance, and by accumulating the balance at the assumed rate\r\nof interest from year to year, we shall have enough to pay the\r\nanticipated expenses, leaving nothing over.\r\n\r\nIn the above case the sums in hand at the beginning of the year are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  1st year   $71.3694 | 6th year      $42.6981\r\n  2d   \"      66.7669 | 7th  \"         35.3890\r\n  3d   \"      61.4650 | 8th  \"         27.5009\r\n  4th  \"      55.7055 | 9th  \"         18.9979\r\n  5th  \"      49.4594 | 10th \"          9.8430\r\n\r\nWe find a somewhat different condition existing during the first years\r\nof a 5-year endowment policy.

Discount from middle of year,\r\nVx-½ or (M x 1.01961) / Dx.]\r\n\r\nBy the actuaries' rate we have, with the customary loading for\r\nexpense:\r\n\r\n  Single premium: $721.66 (loaded, $34.36). Five premiums, $188.70\r\n  (loaded $37.78). Annual premium, $105.65 (loaded $21.11).\r\n\r\nAdmitting the correctness of the new method, we must conclude that the\r\npresent single premium is not sufficiently loaded to cover its own\r\nexpenses, while the annual payment policy pays more than its just\r\nshare. A prominent and thoroughly informed life insurance president\r\nsays in this connection: \"Many of the policies, particularly the short\r\nterm endowments, are charged with too high a percentage of expenses to\r\nprove a good investment at maturity or profitable to the insured in\r\ncase of surrender.\" This is not to be wondered at when the applicant\r\nfor a 10-year endowment policy sees at a glance that he must pay, in\r\nthe gross, more than is returned unless he should die in the interim,\r\nin which case a plain \"life\" or \"term\" policy would have answered the\r\npurpose. Under the new system of assessing expenses one form is as\r\ndesirable as another, from the standpoint of the insured or the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe new premium for the 10-year endowment policy, $89.71, commends\r\nitself at once to the applicant, who can easily see that his total\r\noutlay must fall short of the amount ultimately to be realized, of\r\ncourse, disregarding interest and probable dividends in both cases.\r\n\r\nIn discounting the future expense contributions I have not taken the\r\nchances of dying into account. Hence the expense reserve in any\r\ninstance applies only to that individual case, and, in the event of\r\ndeath or surrender before the maturity of the policy, the amount of\r\nthe expense fund not used would naturally revert to the insured.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of expense assessment outlined above will doubtless be\r\npronounced impracticable by the majority of insurance men.\r\n\r\nSuch a far reaching reform is too much to hope for, at least in the\r\nimmediate future.\r\n\r\nNo well informed life insurance expert will deny that there are\r\nopportunities for improvement in the business, but to graft new\r\nmethods on old companies is a hopeless undertaking.\r\n\r\nIt is well, however, to have new methods well matured in advance of\r\nthe public demand, and I feel convinced that the ideas here set forth\r\nare in the line of the reform which, before long, must be instituted\r\nby the companies if they would retain the confidence and patronage of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nDoubtless many insurance presidents could tell of suggestions which\r\nhave impressed them favorably and which they would gladly have adopted\r\nwere it not for the injustice done thereby to older members and the\r\nchanges necessary to bring existing contracts into conformity with the\r\nnew system. Similar objections may be urged against the ideas here\r\nadvanced, and I must confess I hardly see a way by which the present\r\nsuggestions can be utilized by existing companies. We can only hope\r\nthat sooner or later some of the new theories may be practically\r\ntested. Meanwhile the companies at present in the field are doing a\r\ngreat work for the good of humanity, even though their methods may be,\r\nin some particulars, more practical than scientific.\r\n\r\nWinchester, Mass.

WILLS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLOOD AT KARLSBAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the flood which occurred in Germany and Bohemia, the last week\r\nof November, Karlsbad was especially unfortunate; it suffered such an\r\ninundation as had never before been known in the \"Sprudelstadt.\" On\r\nthe evening of November 23, the Tepl was very much swollen by the\r\nrain, which had continued for several days, but it was supposed that\r\nthere was no danger of a flood, as the bed of the river had been put\r\nin proper condition. During the forenoon of November 24, the water\r\nsuddenly began to rise with such astonishing rapidity that within half\r\nan hour all the lower streets were like turbulent rivers and the Alte\r\nand Neue Wiese were transformed into a lake. The stores on the Alte\r\nWiese were under water to the roofs, and the proprietors, who were\r\ntrying to save their goods, were surprised by the water and had to\r\ntake refuge in the trees. They were rescued by having ropes thrown to\r\nthem, and during this work a catastrophe occurred which was a great\r\nmisfortune to all classes of citizens. The beloved burgermeister of\r\nKarlsbad, Dr. Rudolf Knoll, who had just recovered from a severe\r\nillness, was, with others, directing the work from the balcony of one\r\nof the houses, when a rope by which a man was being drawn through the\r\nwater broke, and the man was carried off by the waves. The fright and\r\nexcitement of the scene gave the burgermeister a shock which caused\r\nhis instant death, but the man who was in danger was brought safely\r\nout of the water.\r\n\r\nThe water was 9 ft. in Marienbaderstrasse, the Marktplatz,\r\nMuhlbadgasse, the Sprudelgasse, Kreuzgasse, Kaiserstrasse, and\r\nEgerstrasse, and flooded the quay, causing great destruction. All\r\nplaces of business were flooded, the doors and iron shutters were\r\npushed in by the force of the water and the goods were carried away or\r\nruined.\r\n\r\nThe house called \"Zum Kaffeebaum\" was undermined and part of it fell\r\nto the ground; the same fate was feared for other buildings. The\r\nSophien and Curhaus bridges were carried away. Other bridges were\r\ngreatly damaged, and the masonry along the banks of the river was\r\npartially destroyed. The Sprudelgasse was completely washed out, and\r\nthe condition of the Muhlbadgasse was almost as bad. The fire\r\ndepartment with its apparatus had great difficulty in saving the\r\ninhabitants and guests, as there were very few boats or pontoons at\r\ntheir command, and the soldiers (Pionniere) from Prague and the\r\nfiremen from the neighboring towns did not arrive until evening.\r\nFortunately the water began to fall in the night, and the next day it\r\nhad gone down so that it left its terrible work visible. The Sprudel\r\nand the mineral springs were not injured, but, on the other hand, the\r\nwater pipes of the bathing establishments and the gas pipes were\r\ncompletely destroyed.--_Illustrirte Zeitung._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEATRICAL WATER PLAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of the plays at Hengler's Circus in London a water scene is\r\nintroduced, for which purpose the main ring is flooded with water in a\r\nmanner which is both striking and interesting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOODING A CIRCUS RING.]\r\n\r\nThe ring is entirely lined with stout macintosh sheeting, and into\r\nthis, from two large conduits. 23,000 gallons of water are poured, the\r\ntank being filled to a depth of some 2 ft. in the remarkably short\r\ntime of 35 seconds. A steamboat and other small craft are then\r\nlaunched and the adventures of the heroine then proceed. She falls\r\noverboard, we believe, but is saved after desperate and amusing\r\nstruggles. Our engravings, which are from the _Graphic_, illustrate\r\nthe mode of filling the ring with water, and the steamboat launch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A THEATRICAL STEAMBOAT.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENCE IN THE THEATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the pretty little hall of the Boulevard des Italiens, at Paris, a\r\nstriking exhibition of simulated hypnotism is given every evening.\r\n\r\nThis entertainment, which has met with much success, was devised by\r\nMr. Melies, director of the establishment, which was founded many\r\nyears ago by the celebrated prestidigitator whose popular name (Robert\r\nHoudin) it still bears. This performance carries instruction with it,\r\nfor it shows how easily the most surprising phenomena of the\r\npathologic state can be imitated. To this effect, several exhibitions\r\nare given every evening.\r\n\r\nMr. Harmington, a convinced disciple of Mesmer, asks for a subject,\r\nand finds one in the hall. A young artist named Marius presents\r\nhimself. Mr. Harmington makes him perform all sorts of extravagant\r\nacts, accompanied with a continuous round of pantomimes that are\r\nrendered the more striking by the supposed state of somnipathy of the\r\nsubject. At the moment at which Marius is finishing his most\r\nextraordinary exercises, a policeman suddenly breaks in upon the stage\r\nin order to execute the recent orders relative to hypnotism. But he\r\nhimself is subjugated by Mr. Harmington and thrown down by the\r\nvibrations of which the encephalus of this terrible magnetizer is the\r\ncenter. When the curtain falls, the representative of authority is\r\nstruggling against the catalepsy that is overcoming him.\r\n\r\nAll the phenomena of induced sleep are successively simulated with\r\nmuch naturalness by Mr. Jules David, who plays the part of Marius in\r\nthis pleasing little performance.\r\n\r\nAt a certain moment, after skillfully simulated passes made by the\r\nmagnetizer, Mr. David suddenly becomes as rigid as a stick of wood,\r\nand falls in pivoting on his heels (Fig. 1). Did not Mr. Harmington\r\nrun to his assistance, he would inevitably crack his skull upon the\r\nfloor, but the magnetizer stands just behind him in order to receive\r\nhim in his arms. Then he lifts him, and places him upon two chairs\r\njust as he would do with a simple board. He places the head of the\r\nsubject upon the seat of one of the chairs and the heels upon that of\r\nthe other. Mr. David then remains in a state of perfect immobility.\r\nNot a muscle is seen to relax, and not a motion betrays the\r\npersistence of life in him. The simulation is perfect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--CATALEPTIC RIGIDITY.]\r\n\r\nIn order to complete the astonishment of the spectators, Mr.\r\nHarmington seats himself triumphantly upon the abdomen of the subject\r\nand slowly raises his feet and holds them suspended in the air to show\r\nthat it is the subject only that supports him, without the need of\r\nany other point of support than the two chairs (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--EXPERIMENT ON THE SAME SUBJECT.]\r\n\r\nUsually, there are plenty of persons ingenuous enough to think that\r\nMr. David is actually in a cataleptic sleep, one of the characters of\r\nwhich is cadaveric rigidity.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. David's neck is entirely bare, it is not possible to suppose\r\nthat the simulator of catalepsy wears an iron corset concealed beneath\r\nhis clothing. He has performed a feat of strength and skill rendered\r\neasy by the exercise that he has given to the muscles occupying the\r\n_colliciæ_ of his vertebral column. This part of the muscular system\r\nis greatly developed in the weakest and least hardy persons. In fact,\r\nin order that man may keep a vertical position and execute an infinite\r\nmultitude of motions in which stability is involved, nature has had to\r\ngive him a large number of different organs. The muscles of the back\r\nare arranged upon several superposed layers, the vertebral column is\r\ndoubly recurved in order that it may have more strength, and, finally,\r\nrachidion nerves issue from each vertebra in order to regulate the\r\ncontraction of each muscular fasciculus according to the requirements\r\nof equilibrium. The trick is so easy that we have seen youths\r\nbelonging to the Ligue d'Education Physique immediately imitate Mr.\r\nDavid after seeing him operate but once.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of those who would like to perform it, we shall add that\r\nMr. David takes care to bend his body in the form of an arch in such a\r\nway that the convexity shall be beneath. As Mr. Harmington never fails\r\nto place himself in the center of the line that joins Mr. David's head\r\nand heels, his weight is divided into two parts, that is to say, 88\r\npounds on each side of the point of support. The result is that the\r\nstress necessary is less than that of a strong man of the Halle\r\nlifting a bag of wheat to his shoulder or of an athlete supporting a\r\nhuman pyramid. The force of contraction of the muscular fibers brought\r\ninto play in this experiment is much greater than is commonly\r\nbelieved. In his lectures on physiology, Milne-Edwards cites some\r\nfacts that prove that it may exceed 600 pounds per square inch of\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--THE PERFORATE ARM.]\r\n\r\nThe experiment on cadaveric rigidity is followed by others in\r\ninsensibility. Mr. David, without wincing, allows a poignard to be\r\nthrust into his arm, which Mr. Harmington has previously\r\n\"cataleptized\" (Fig. 3). This trick is performed by means of a blade\r\ndivided into two parts that are connected by a semicircle. This\r\nprocess is well known to prestidigitators, but it might be executed in\r\na genuine manner. In fact, on replacing the poignard by one of the\r\ngold needles used by physicians for acupuncture, it would be possible\r\nto dispense with prestidigitation. Under such conditions it is\r\npossible to transpierce a person's arm. The pain is supportable, and\r\nconsists in the sensation of a prick produced in the passage of the\r\nneedle through the skin. As for the muscular flesh, that is of itself\r\nperfectly insensible. The needle, upon the necessary antiseptic\r\nprecautions being taken, may traverse the veins and arteries with\r\nimpunity, provided that it is not allowed to remain long enough to\r\nbring about the formation of a clot of coagulated blood (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--AN ARM TRANSPIERCED BY A NEEDLE.]\r\n\r\nWe think it of interest to add that it is necessary that the\r\nexperiment be performed by a practitioner if one desires to\r\ndemonstrate upon himself a very curious physiological fact that has\r\nbeen known from the remotest antiquity. It has been employed for\r\nseveral thousand years in Chinese medicine, for opening a passage for\r\nthe bad spirits that produce diseases. For some years past a much more\r\nserious use has been made of it in European medicine for introducing\r\nelectric currents into the interior of the organism. In this case the\r\nperimeter of the needle is insulated, and the electricity flows into\r\nthe organism through the point. We have several times had these\r\noperations performed upon ourselves, and this permits us to assert\r\nthat the above mentioned facts are absolutely true.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWER PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY.\r\n\r\nBy Prof. SAMUEL BELL, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysiology has for many decades been a science founded on experiment,\r\nand pathology has been rapidly pressing forward in the same direction.\r\nTo read the accounts of how certain conclusions have been arrived at\r\nin the laboratory, by ingenious devices and by skillful manipulations,\r\nis as fascinating as any tale of adventure.\r\n\r\nWhen the microscope began its work, how discouraging was the vastness\r\nand complexity of the discoveries which it brought to light; how many\r\nyears has it been diligently used, and how uncertain are we still\r\nabout many of its revelations! But what a happy conjecture of man, and\r\nas proper environment takes place we may reach better results! Let me\r\ngive an illustration:\r\n\r\nSome thirty years ago, Virchow began his studies and lectures upon\r\ncellular pathology. The enthusiasm which he awakened spread over the\r\nwhole medical world. The wonderful attention to detail, the broad\r\nphilosophy which signalized his observations, were alike remarkable.\r\nHis class room was packed with students from every country, who\r\nthought it no hardship to struggle for a seat at eight o'clock in the\r\nmorning. With his blackboard behind him and specimens of pathology\r\nbefore him, and microscopes coursing upon railway tracks around the\r\ntables which filled the room, he was the embodiment of the teacher;\r\nhis highest honor was as discoverer. The life and importance of the\r\ncell, both in health and disease, it has been his work to discover and\r\nto teach. The point of view from which he has classified tumors is\r\nfounded on this basis, and remains the accepted method. The light\r\nwhich he cast upon the nature of inflammation has not yet been\r\nobscured, and while other phenomena appear, the multiplication of\r\ncells and nuclei and the formation of connective tissue in the process\r\nof inflammation will always call to mind his labors.\r\n\r\nTo one of Virchow's pupils, Prof. Recklinghausen, we chiefly owe our\r\nknowledge of the phenomena of diapedesis as a part of the inflammatory\r\nactivity. How incredible it seems that masses of living matter can\r\nmake their way through the walls of blood vessels which do not rupture\r\nand which have no visible apertures!\r\n\r\nVirchow fixed his attention upon the forms and activities of the\r\ncells, their multiplication and degradation, and how they build up\r\ntissues, both healthy and morbid.\r\n\r\nTo another matter with which, both literally and metaphorically, the\r\nair is filled, we must also make allusion. The existence of\r\nmicro-organisms in countless numbers is no new fact, but the influence\r\nthey may exert over living tissues has only lately become the subject\r\nof earnest attention. So long as they were not known to have any\r\npractical bearing upon human welfare, they interested almost nobody,\r\nbut when, however, it was shown that putrefaction of meat is due to\r\nthe agency of the _bacterium termo_, and the decomposition of albumen\r\nto the _bacillus subtilis_; when anthrax in cattle and sheep was found\r\nto depend on the _bacillus anthracis_, and that in human beings it\r\ncaused malignant pustules; when suppuration of wounds was found to be\r\nassociated with micrococci; and when it was announced that by a\r\nprocess of inoculation cattle could be protected against anthrax, and\r\nthat by carbolic spray and other well known precautions the\r\nsuppuration of wounds could be prevented--all the world lent its ears\r\nand investigation at once began.\r\n\r\nBecause labors in bacteriology promised to be fruitful in practical\r\nresults, the workers speedily became innumerable, and we are\r\naccumulating a wondrous store of facts. How long now is the list of\r\ndiseases in which germs make their appearance--in pneumonia, in\r\nendocarditis, in erysipelas, in pyæmia, in tuberculosis, and so on and\r\nso on. One of the most striking illustrations is the gonococcus of\r\ngonorrhoea, whose presence in and around gives to the pus cells\r\ntheir virulent properties, and when transferred to the eye works such\r\nlamentable mischief. Without their existence the inoculation of pus in\r\nthe healthy eye is harmless; pus bearing the gonococci excites the\r\nmost intense inflammation. Similar suppurative action in the cornea is\r\noften caused by infection of cocci. The proof of causation may be\r\nfound in the fact that the most effective cure now practiced for such\r\nsuppuration is to sterilize them by the actual cautery. Rosenbach says\r\nthat he knows six distinct microbes which are capable of exciting\r\nsuppuration in man. Their activity may be productive of a poison, or\r\nputrefactive alkaloid, which is absorbed.\r\n\r\nThere are at present two prominent theories in regard to the\r\ninfections which produce disease. The first is based upon chemical\r\nprocesses, the second upon the multiplication of living organisms. The\r\nchemical theory maintains that after the infectious element has been\r\nreceived into the body it acts as a ferment, and gives rise to certain\r\nmorbid processes, upon the principle of catalysis. The theory of\r\norganisms, or the germ theory, maintains that the infectious elements\r\nare living organisms, which, being received into the system, are\r\nreproduced indefinitely, and excite morbid processes which are\r\ncharacteristic of certain types of disease. This latter theory so\r\nreadily explains many of the facts connected with the development and\r\nreproduction of infectious diseases, that it has been unqualifiedly\r\nadopted by a large number of investigators. The proofs of this theory\r\nhad not, however, advanced beyond the demonstrations of the presence\r\nof certain forms of bacteria in the pathological changes of a very\r\nlimited number of infectious diseases, until February, 1882, when Koch\r\nannounced his discovery of the tubercle bacillus, since which time\r\nnearly every disease has its supposed microbe, and the race is,\r\nindeed, swift in which the would-be discoverers press forward with new\r\ngerms for public favor.\r\n\r\nThe term bacteria or microbe refers to particles of matter,\r\nmicroscopic in size, which belong to the vegetable kingdom, where they\r\nare known as fungi. If we examine a drop of stagnant water under the\r\nmicroscope, amplifying say four hundred diameters, we see it loaded\r\nwith minute bodies, some mere points, others slightly elongated into\r\nrods, all actively in motion and in various positions, a countless\r\nconfusion. If evaporation now takes place, all is still. If we now\r\napply moisture, the dried-up granules will show activity, as though\r\nthey had not been disturbed.\r\n\r\nAll these different organisms have become familiar to us under the\r\ngeneric term bacteria, which is a very unfortunate application, as it\r\nreally applies to only a single class of fungi. Cohn calls them\r\nschizomycetes, and makes the following classifications:\r\n\r\n  1. _Sphero-bacteria_, or microbes.\r\n  2. _Micro-bacteria_, or bacteria.\r\n  3. _Desmo-bacteria_, or bacilli.\r\n  4. _Spiroteria_, or spirillæ.\r\n\r\nThe _spiro-bacteria_, or micrococci, are the simplest of the fungi,\r\nand appear as minute organisms of spherical form. They multiply by\r\nfission, a single coccus forming two, these two producing four, and so\r\non. They present a variety of appearances under the microscope. From\r\nsingle isolated specimens (which under the highest magnifying power\r\npresent nothing beyond minute points) you will observe them in pairs,\r\nagain in fours, or in clusters of hundreds (forming zoöglea) and still\r\nadhering together, forming chains. When a given specimen is about to\r\ndivide, it is seen to elongate slightly, then a constriction is\r\nformed, which deepens until complete fission ensues.\r\n\r\nMicrococci possess no visible structure. They consist of a minute\r\ndroplet of protoplasm (mycroprotein) surrounded by a delicate cell\r\nmembrane. Certain forms are embedded in a capsule (diameter 0.0008 to\r\n0.0001 millimeter).\r\n\r\nThese little organisms, when observed in a fluid like blood, sputum,\r\netc., are found to present very active movements, although provided\r\nwith no organs of locomotion.\r\n\r\nThis Brownian motion is possessed by almost every minute particle of\r\nmatter, organic and inorganic, and is not due to any inherent power of\r\nthe individual. They are almost omnipresent, abounding in the air, the\r\nearth, the water, are always found in millions where moist organic\r\nmatter is undergoing decomposition, and are associated with the\r\nprocesses of fermentation--in fact, they are essential to it. The\r\nsouring of milk succeeds the multiplication of these germs. Certain\r\nvarieties are pigmented, and we observe colonies of chromogenic cocci\r\nmultiplying upon slices of boiled potato, eggs, etc., presenting all\r\nthe colors of the rainbow. All of these germs are not the cause of\r\ndisease. Certain species, however (termed pathogenic), are always\r\nassociated with certain diseased conditions.\r\n\r\nThe _bacteria-termo_--micro-bacteria--are slightly elongated, and\r\ninasmuch as they multiply by division, frequently appear coupled\r\ntogether, linked in pairs, and in chains. They are generally found in\r\nputrefying liquids, especially infusions of vegetable matter. They\r\npossess mobility to a remarkable degree. Observing a field of\r\nbacteria-termo under the microscope, they may be seen actively engaged\r\nin twining and twisting. A flagellum has been demonstrated as attached\r\nto one or both extremities. This is too minute to be generally\r\nresolved, even if it is a common appendage.\r\n\r\n_Desmo-bacteria_ (or bacilli) are rod-like organisms, occurring of\r\nvarious lengths and different thicknesses. In a slide of the bacillus\r\nof tuberculosis and anthrax, we notice at intervals dots which\r\nrepresent the spores from which, as the rods break up, future bacilli\r\nare developed.\r\n\r\nThen we have _spiro-bacteria,_ the spirilla and the spirochetæ; the\r\nformer having short open spirals, the latter long and closely wound\r\nspirals. The _spirillum, volutans_ is often found in drinking water,\r\nand in common with some other specimens of this class is provided with\r\nflagellæ, sometimes at both extremities, which furnish the means of\r\nrapid locomotion. The spiro-bacteria multiply by spores, although\r\nlittle is at present known of their life history. They frequently are\r\nattached together at their extremities, forming zigzag chains.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that bacteria differ greatly in appearance from the\r\nelongated dot of the bacterium proper, to the elongated rod or\r\ncylinder of the bacillus, and the long spirals of spiro-bacteria. It\r\nis unfortunate that they are not sufficiently constant in habit to\r\nalways attach themselves to one or the other of these genera. The\r\nmicrococcus has a habit of elongating at times until it is impossible\r\nto recognize him except as a bacterium; while bacilli, again, break up\r\nuntil their particles exactly resemble micrococci.\r\n\r\nBacteria cannot exist without water; certain forms require oxygen,\r\nwhile others thrive equally well without it; some thrive in solution\r\nof simple salts, while others require albuminoid material.\r\n\r\nBacteriology, with its relation to the science of medicine, is of\r\nimportance to every investigating physician; it covers our knowledge\r\nof the relation of these minute organisms to the ætiology of disease.\r\nWhat has been gained as to practical application in the treatment of\r\ndisease? This question is not infrequently asked in a sneering manner.\r\nWe can, in reply, say that the results are not all in the future. It\r\nis encouraging that results have been attained which have had a very\r\nimportant practical bearing, and that these complaints come generally\r\nfrom individuals least acquainted with scientific investigations in\r\nbacteriology.\r\n\r\nIn the study of the relation of a given bacterium to a certain\r\ndisease, it becomes necessary to attend carefully to three different\r\noperations: First, the organism supposed to cause the disease must be\r\nfound and isolated. Second, it must be cultivated through several\r\ngenerations in order that absolute purity may be secured. Lastly, the\r\ngerm must be again introduced into a healthy living being. If the\r\npreceding steps be carried out, and the original disease be\r\ncommunicated by inoculation, and the germs be again found in the\r\ndiseased body, we have no alternative; we must conclude that we have\r\nascertained the cause of the disease. The importance of being familiar\r\nwith the ætiology of the disease before we can expect to combat it\r\nwith any well-grounded hope of success is evident.\r\n\r\nIf the sputum of a phthisical patient be submitted to the skilled\r\nmicroscopist, he is nearly always able to demonstrate bacilli, but\r\nthis goes for very little. Because bacilli are found in phthisis, it\r\nis no more certain that they are the cause of phthisis than it is\r\ncertain that cheese mites are the cause of cheese. Well, suppose we\r\nwere to inject sputum from a phthisical person into the lower animal\r\nand tuberculosis follows, and then announce to the profession that we\r\nhave demonstrated the relation of the cause and effect between bacilli\r\nand phthisis? Why we would start such an uproar of objections as would\r\nspeedily convince us that there was much work yet in the domain of\r\nbacteriology.\r\n\r\nThe scientific investigators would say you have injected with the\r\nsputum into the blood of your unfortunate patient, pus, morphological\r\nelements, and perhaps half a dozen other forms of bacteria, any one of\r\nwhich is just as likely to produce the disease as the bacillus you\r\nhave selected.\r\n\r\nThe first important step is, first isolate your bacillus. If I were to\r\ntake a glass plate, one side of which is coated with a thick solution\r\nof peptonized gelatin, and allow the water to collect, the gelatinous\r\nmatter will become solid. If now, with a wire dipped in some\r\ntuberculous matter, I draw a line along the gelatin, I have deposited\r\nat intervals along this line, specimens of tubercle bacilli. If this\r\nplate be now kept at a proper temperature, after a few days, wherever\r\nthe bacilli have been caught, a grayish spot will appear, which,\r\neasily seen with the naked eye, gradually spreads and becomes larger.\r\nThese spots are colonies containing thousands of bacilli. Let us\r\nreturn to our gelatin plate.\r\n\r\nWe find a spot which answers to the description of a colony of\r\ntubercle bacilli. We now take a minute particle from this colony on a\r\nwire and convey it to the surface of some hardened blood serum in a\r\ntest tube. We plug the tube so that no air germs may drop in, and\r\nplace it in an incubator at the proper temperature. After several\r\ndays, if no contamination be present, a colony of bacilli will appear\r\naround the spot where we sowed the spores. Let us repeat the process.\r\n\r\nTake a particle from this colony, and transfer it to another tube.\r\nThis is our second culture. This must be repeated until we are\r\nsatisfied that we have secured a _pure_ culture. If this be carried to\r\nthe twenty-fifth generation, we may be assured that there remains no\r\npus, no ptomaines, nothing but the desired bacilli.\r\n\r\nIt is a proper material now for inoculation, and if we inoculate some\r\nof the lower animals, for instance the monkey, we produce a disease\r\nidentical with phthisis pulmpnalis. Bacteria also afford peculiar\r\nchemical reactions. For example, nitric acid will discharge all the\r\ncolor from all bacilli artificially dyed with anilin, except those of\r\ntubercle and anthrax. One species is stained readily with a dye that\r\nleaves another unaltered. Thus we are enabled in the laboratory to\r\ndetermine whether the bacilli found in sputum, for example, are from\r\ntubercle or are the bacteria of decomposition.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have said of the tubercle bacillus, it would seem\r\nthoroughly demonstrated that it is the cause of tubercle in these\r\nanimals. But we must walk cautiously here. These are not human beings,\r\nwho know that like results would follow their inoculation. The animals\r\nused by Koch are animals very subject to tubercle.\r\n\r\nWe must, from the very nature of our environment, be constantly\r\ninhaling these germs as we pass through the wards of our hospitals;\r\nyes, they are floating in the air of our streets and dwellings. It\r\nbecomes necessary then for us to inquire: If bacteria cause disease,\r\nin what manner do they produce it? The healthy organism is always\r\nbeset with a multitude of non-pathogenic bacteria. They occupy the\r\nnatural cavities, especially the alimentary canal. They feed on the\r\nsubstances lying in their neighborhood, whether brought into the body\r\nor secreted by the tissues. In so doing they set up chemical changes\r\nin their substances. Where the organs are acting normally these fungi\r\nwork no mischief. The products of decomposition thus set up are\r\nharmless, or are conveyed out of the body before they begin to be\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nIf bacteria develop to an inordinate degree, if the contents of organs\r\nare not frequently discharged, fermentative processes may be set up,\r\nwhich result in disease. Bacteria must always multiply and exist at\r\nthe expense of the body which they infest, and the more weakened the\r\nvital forces become, the more favorable is the soil for their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nSepticæmia is caused by the absorption of the products of\r\nputrefaction, induced before bacteria can multiply inside or outside\r\nthe body. Bacteria must find a congenial soil. The so-called cholera\r\nbacillus must gain access to the intestinal tract before it finds\r\nconditions suitable to colonization. It does not seem to multiply in\r\nthe stomach or in the blood, but once injected into the duodenum\r\ndevelops with astonishing rapidity, and the delicate epithelial cells\r\nof the villi become swollen, soften and break down, exposing the\r\nmucosa.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that _bouillon_ in which Loeffler's diphtheria\r\nbacillus has grown, and which has been passed through unglazed\r\nporcelain filters, shows the presence of a poison which is capable of\r\nproducing the same results upon inoculation as the pure culture of the\r\nbacillus itself. Zarniko, working upon the same organism, obtained a\r\nnumber of positive results that led him to declare this bacillus is\r\nthe cause of epidemic diphtheria, in spite of many assertions to the\r\ncontrary. Chantmesse and Widal record the results of their work as to\r\nwhat will most easily and effectively destroy the bacillus of\r\ndiphtheria.\r\n\r\nThe only three substances that actually checked and destroyed its\r\nvitality were phenic acid (5 per cent.), camphor (20 per cent.), olive\r\noil (25 per cent.), in combination. For the last I substitute\r\nglycerine, because this allows the mixture to penetrate farther into\r\nthe mucous membrane than oil, the latter favoring a tendency to pass\r\nover the surface. This mixture when heated separates into two layers,\r\nthe upper one viscid and forming a sort of \"glycerol,\" the lower\r\nclear. The latter will completely sterilize a thread dipped in a pure\r\nculture of the diphtheria bacillus. Corrosive sublimate was not\r\nexamined because in strong enough doses it would be dangerous and in\r\nweaker ones it would be useless.\r\n\r\nThe facts obtained in regards to the streptococcus of erysipelas are\r\nreported as follows: That both chemical and experimental evidence\r\nteach the extreme ease of a renewed attack of the disease; that it is\r\npossible to kill guinea pigs by an intoxication when they are immune\r\nto an inoculation of the culture in ordinary quantities. And this\r\nlatter fact should warn experimenters trying to obtain immunity in man\r\nby the inoculation of non-pathogenic bacteria, because the same\r\nresults may be reached.\r\n\r\nA new theory in regard to fevers and the relation of micro-organisms\r\nis suggested by Roussy, viz.: That it is a fermentation produced by a\r\ndiastase or soluble ferment found in all micro-organisms and cells,\r\nand which they use in attacking and transforming matter, either inside\r\ntheir substance or without it.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of the malaria parasite to that of recurrent fever is\r\nnoted in the work of Sacharoff. He states that there exists in the\r\nblood of those suffering from recurrent fever a hæmatozoon, which is\r\nmost prominent after the fever has begun to fall, when it is of\r\nenormous proportions, twenty or more diameters of a red blood\r\ncorpuscle, although smaller ones may still be found. The parasite\r\nconsists of a delicate amoeboid body containing a multitude of dark,\r\nround, uniform, sharply outlined, movable granules. Besides these, the\r\nprotoplasm contains a generally grayish homogeneous nucleus as large\r\nas one or two red blood corpuscles. The protoplasm sends out\r\npseudopodia (with granules), which sometimes separate and appear as\r\nsmall delicate pieces of protoplasm. They vary in size, and are often\r\nswallowed by the red blood corpuscles in which they grow, and finally\r\ndevelop into the above mentioned amoeboid bodies.\r\n\r\nProf. J. Lewis Smith has made a great many autopsies of children dead\r\nfrom cholera infantum, and almost invariably found the stomach and\r\nliver in a comparatively healthy condition. Ganghen, who has given\r\nthis subject considerable study, denies the existence of any specific\r\ngerm in the summer diarrhea of infants, but claims to have found three\r\ndifferent germs in the intestines of children suffering from cholera\r\ninfantum, each producing a chemical poison which is capable of\r\nproducing vomiting, purging, and even death. A great variety of germs\r\nare found in drinking water, and no doubt countless numbers are taken\r\ninto the digestive tract, and the principal reason why pathological\r\nconditions do not occur more frequently is on account of the\r\ngermicidal qualities of the gastric juice.\r\n\r\nThe comma bacillus of Koch, and the typhoid fever germ of Eberth, are\r\nespecially destroyed in normal gastric juice. When the germs are very\r\nnumerous, they run the gauntlet of the stomach (as the gastric juice\r\nis secreted only during digestion); and once in the alkaline\r\nintestinal canal they are capable of setting up disease, other\r\nconditions contributing--ill health, deranged digestion, etc.\r\n\r\nMittnam has made a study of bacteria beneath the nails, and reports,\r\nafter examining persons following different occupations, having found\r\nnumerous varieties of micro-organisms; which are interesting from a\r\nscientific standpoint relative to the importance of thoroughly\r\ncleansing the hands before undertaking any surgical procedure. He\r\nfound, out of twenty-five experiments, 78 varieties of bacteria, of\r\nwhich 36 were classed as micrococci, 21 diplococci, 18 rods, 3\r\nsarcinæ, and 1 yeast. Cooks, barbers, waiters, etc., were examined.\r\n\r\nThe blood, defibrinated and freshly drawn, has marked germicidal\r\naction; for bacteria its action is decidedly deadly, even hours after\r\nit has been drawn from the body. Especially were anti-germic qualities\r\nnoticed upon pathogenic bacteria. Buchner put the bacilli of anthrax\r\nin a quantity of blood, and in two hours the number was reduced from\r\n4,800 to 56, and in three hours only 3 living bacteria remained. Other\r\nbacteria were experimented upon in blood with similar results, but the\r\ndestruction of the organism from putrefaction was much less marked,\r\nand on some varieties the blood had little or no action.\r\n\r\nIt is not the object of these remarks to even give a _résumé_ of the\r\n_status præsens_ of bacteriology, but simply to stimulate thought in\r\nthat direction. The claims of some of the ultra-bacteriologists may\r\nnever be realized, but enough has been accomplished to revolutionize\r\nthe treatment of certain diseases, and the observing student will do\r\nwell to keep his eye on the microbe, as it seems from the latest\r\ninvestigations that its star is in the ascendant. And who can\r\nprognosticate but that in the next decade an entire revolution in the\r\nætiology and treatment of many diseases may take place?\r\n\r\nDetroit, Mich.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOSITION OF KOCH'S LYMPH.\r\n\r\nWHAT PROFESSOR KOCH SAYS IT IS, AND WHAT IT CAN DO.\r\n\r\n(By Cable to the _Medical Record_.)\r\n\r\nBERLIN, January 15, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curiosity to know the composition of the famous lymph has been\r\ngratified by the publication to-day of an article by Professor Koch on\r\nthe subject. In the following, as will be seen, he reaffirms his\r\noriginal convictions and acknowledges the valuable assistance he has\r\nreceived from those who have used his fluid, and thus helped him in\r\nthe accumulation of experience.\r\n\r\nProfessor Koch says: Two months ago I published the results of my\r\nexperiments with the new remedy for tuberculosis, since which time\r\nmany physicians who received the preparation have been enabled to\r\nbecome acquainted with its properties through their own experiments.\r\nSo far as I have been able to review the statements published and the\r\ncommunications received by letter, my predictions have been fully and\r\ncompletely confirmed. The general consensus of opinion is that the\r\nremedy has a specific action upon tubercular tissues, and is,\r\ntherefore, applicable as a very delicate and sure reagent for\r\ndiscovering latent and diagnosing doubtful tuberculous processes.\r\nRegarding the curative effects of the remedy, most reports agree that,\r\ndespite the comparatively short duration of its application, many\r\npatients have shown more or less pronounced improvement. It has been\r\naffirmed that in not a few cases even a cure has been established.\r\nStanding quite by itself is the assertion that the remedy may not only\r\nbe dangerous in cases which have advanced too far--a fact which may\r\nforthwith be conceded--but also that it actually promotes the\r\ntuberculous process, being therefore injurious.\r\n\r\nDuring the past six weeks I myself have had opportunity to bring\r\ntogether further experiences touching the curative effects and\r\ndiagnostic application of the remedy in the cases of about one hundred\r\nand fifty sufferers from tuberculosis of the most varied types in this\r\ncity and in the Moabit Hospital.\r\n\r\nI can only say that everything I have latterly seen accords with my\r\nprevious observations. There has been nothing to modify in what I\r\nbefore reported. As long as it was only a question of proving the\r\naccuracy of my indications, it was needless for any one to know what\r\nthe remedy contained or whence it was derived. On the contrary,\r\nsubsequent testing would necessarily be more unbiased, the less people\r\nknew of the remedy itself. Now, after sufficient confirmatory testing,\r\nthe importance of the remedy is proved, my next task is to extend my\r\nstudy of the remedy beyond the field where it has hitherto been\r\napplied, and if possible to apply the principle underlying the\r\ndiscovery to other diseases.\r\n\r\nThis task naturally demands a full knowledge of the remedy. I\r\ntherefore consider that the time has arrived when the requisite\r\nindications in this direction shall be made. This is done in what\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nBefore going into the remedy itself, I deem it necessary for the\r\nbetter understanding of its mode of operation to state briefly the way\r\nby which I arrived at the discovery. If a healthy guinea pig be\r\ninoculated with the pure cultivation of German Kultur of tubercle\r\nbacilli, the wound caused by the inoculation mostly closes over with a\r\nsticky matter, and appears in its early days to heal. Only after ten\r\nto fourteen days a hard nodule presents itself, which, soon breaking,\r\nforms an ulcerating sore, which continues until the animal dies. Quite\r\na different condition of things occurs when a guinea pig already\r\nsuffering from tuberculosis is inoculated. An animal successfully\r\ninoculated from four to six weeks before is best adapted for this\r\npurpose. In such an animal the small indentation assumes the same\r\nsticky covering at the beginning, but no nodules form. On the\r\ncontrary, on the day following, or the second day after the\r\ninoculation, the place where the lymph is injected shows a strange\r\nchange. It becomes hard and assumes a darker coloring, which is not\r\nconfined to the inoculation spot, but spreads to the neighboring parts\r\nuntil it attains a diameter of from 0.05 to 1 cm.\r\n\r\nIn a few days it becomes more and more manifest that the skin thus\r\nchanged is necrotic, finally falling off, leaving a flat ulceration\r\nwhich usually heals rapidly and permanently without any involvement of\r\nthe adjacent lymphatic glands. Thus the injected tubercular bacilli\r\nquite differently affect the skin of a healthy guinea pig from one\r\naffected with tuberculosis. This effect is not exclusively produced\r\nwith living tubercular bacilli, but is also observed with the dead\r\nbacilli, the result being the same whether, as I discovered by\r\nexperiments at the outset, the bacilli are killed by a somewhat\r\nprolonged application of a low temperature or boiling heat or by means\r\nof certain chemicals. This peculiar fact I followed up in all\r\ndirections, and this further result was obtained--that killed pure\r\ncultivations of tubercular bacilli, after rinsing in water, might be\r\ninjected in great quantities under healthy guinea pig's skin without\r\nanything occurring beyond local suppuration. Such injections belong to\r\nthe simplest and surest means of producing suppurations free from\r\nliving bacteria.\r\n\r\nTuberculous guinea pigs, on the other hand, are killed by the\r\ninjection of very small quantities of such diluted cultivations. In\r\nfact, within six to forty-eight hours, according to the strength of\r\nthe dose, an injection which is not sufficient to produce the death of\r\nthe animal may cause extended necrosis to the skin in the vicinity of\r\nthe place of injection. If the dilution is still further diluted until\r\nit is scarcely visibly clouded, the animals inoculated remain alive\r\nand a noticeable improvement in their condition soon supervenes. If\r\nthe injections are continued at intervals of from one to two days, the\r\nulcerating inoculation wound becomes smaller and finally scars over,\r\nwhich otherwise it never does; the size of the swollen lymphatic\r\nglands is reduced, the body becomes better nourished, and the morbid\r\nprocess ceases, unless it has gone too far, in which case the animal\r\nperishes from exhaustion. By this means the basis of a curative\r\nprocess against tuberculosis was established.\r\n\r\nAgainst the practical application of such dilutions of dead tubercle\r\nbacilli there presented itself the fact that the tubercle bacilli are\r\nnot absorbed at the inoculation points, nor do they disappear in\r\nanother way, but for a long time remain unchanged, and engender\r\ngreater or smaller suppurative foci. Anything, therefore, intended to\r\nexercise a healing effect on the tuberculous process must be a soluble\r\nsubstance which would be liberated to a certain extent by the fluids\r\nof the body floating around the tubercle bacilli, and be transferred\r\nin a fairly rapid manner to the juices of the body; while the\r\nsubstance producing suppuration apparently remains behind in the\r\ntubercular bacilli, or dissolves but very slowly. The only important\r\npoint was, therefore, to induce outside the body the process going on\r\ninside, if possible, and to extract from the tubercular bacilli alone\r\nthe curative substance. This demanded time and toil, until I finally\r\nsucceeded, with the aid of a forty to fifty per cent. solution of\r\nglycerine, in obtaining an effective substance from the tubercular\r\nbacilli. With the fluid so obtained I made further experiments on\r\nanimals, and finally on human beings. These fluids were given to other\r\nphysicians to enable them to repeat the experiments.\r\n\r\nThe remedy which is used in the new treatment consists of a glycerine\r\nextract, derived from the pure cultivation of tubercle bacilli. Into\r\nthe simple extract there naturally passes from the tubercular bacilli,\r\nbesides the effective substance, all the other matter soluble in fifty\r\nper cent. glycerine.\r\n\r\nConsequently, it contains a certain quantity of mineral salts,\r\ncoloring substances, and other unknown extractive matters. Some of\r\nthese substances can be removed from it tolerably easily. The\r\neffective substance is insoluble in absolute alcohol. It can be\r\nprecipitated by it, though not, indeed, in a pure condition, but still\r\ncombined with the other extractive matter. It is likewise insoluble in\r\nalcohol. The coloring matter may also be removed, rendering it\r\npossible to obtain from the extract a colorless, dry substance\r\ncontaining the effective principle in a much more concentrated form\r\nthan the original glycerine solution. For application in practice this\r\npurification of the glycerine extract offers no advantage, because the\r\nsubstances so eliminated are unessential for the human organism. The\r\nprocess of purification would make the cost of the remedy\r\nunnecessarily high.\r\n\r\nRegarding the constitution of the more effective substances, only\r\nsurmises may for the present be expressed. It appears to me to be\r\nderivative from albuminous bodies, having a close affinity to them. It\r\ndoes not belong to the group of so-called toxalbumins, because it\r\nbears high temperatures, and in the dialyzer goes easily and quickly\r\nthrough the membrane. The proportion of the substance in the extract\r\nto all appearance is very small. It is estimated at fractions of one\r\nper cent., which, if correct, we should have to do with a matter whose\r\neffects upon organisms attacked with tuberculosis go far beyond what\r\nis known to us of the strongest drugs.\r\n\r\nRegarding the manner in which the specific action of the remedy on\r\ntuberculous tissue is to be represented, various hypotheses may\r\nnaturally be put forward. Without wishing to affirm that my view\r\naffords the best explanation, I represent the process myself in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\nThe tubercle bacilli produced when growing in living tissues, the same\r\nas in artificial cultivations, contain substances which variously and\r\nnotably unfavorably influence living elements in their vicinity. Among\r\nthese is a substance which in a certain degree of concentration kills\r\nor so alters living protoplasm that it passes into a condition that\r\nWeigert describes as coagulation necrosis. In tissue thus become\r\nnecrotic the bacillus finds such unfavorable conditions of nourishment\r\nthat it can grow no more and sometimes dies.\r\n\r\nThis explains the remarkable phenomenon that in organs newly attacked\r\nwith tuberculosis, for instance in guinea pigs' spleen and liver,\r\nwhich then are covered with gray nodules, numbers of bacilli are\r\nfound, whereas they are rare or wholly absent when the enormously\r\nenlarged spleen consists almost entirely of whitish substance in a\r\ncondition of coagulation necrosis, such as is often found in cases of\r\nnatural death in tuberculous guinea pigs. The single bacillus cannot,\r\ntherefore, induce necrosis at a great distance, for as soon as\r\nnecrosis attains a certain extension the growth of the bacillus\r\nsubsides, and therewith the production of the necrotizing substance. A\r\nkind of reciprocal compensation thus occurs, causing the vegetation of\r\nisolated bacilli to remain so extraordinarily restricted, as, for\r\ninstance, in lupus and scrofulous glands.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the necrosis generally extends only to a part of the\r\ncells, which then, with further growth, assume the peculiar form of\r\nriesen zelle, or giant cells. Thus, in this interpretation, follow\r\nfirst the explanation Weigert gives of the production of giant cells.\r\n\r\nIf now one increased artificially in the vicinity of the bacillus the\r\namount of necrotizing substance in the tissue, the necrosis would\r\nspread a greater distance. The conditions of nourishment for the\r\nbacillus would thereby become more unfavorable than usual.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the tissue which had become necrotic over a large\r\nextent would decay and detach itself, and where such were possible\r\nwould carry off the inclosed bacilli and eject them outwardly, so far\r\ndisturbing their vegetation that they would much more speedily be\r\nkilled than under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is just in looking at such changes that the effect of the remedy\r\nappears to consist. It contains a certain quantity of necrotizing\r\nsubstance, a correspondingly large dose of which injures certain\r\ntissue elements even in a healthy person, and perhaps the white blood\r\ncorpuscles or adjacent cells, thereby producing fever and a\r\ncomplication of symptoms, whereas with tuberculous patients a much\r\nsmaller quantity suffices to induce at certain places, namely, where\r\ntubercle bacilli are vegetating and have already impregnated the\r\nadjacent region with the same necrotizing matter, more or less\r\nextensive necrosis of the cells, with the phenomena in the whole\r\norganism which result from and are connected with it.\r\n\r\nFor the present, at least, it is impossible to explain the specific\r\ninfluence which the remedy, in accurately defined doses, exercises\r\nupon tuberculous tissue, and the possibility of increasing the doses\r\nwith such remarkable rapidity, and the remedial effects which have\r\nunquestionably been produced under not too favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nOf the consumptive patients whom he described as temporarily cured,\r\ntwo have been returned to the Moabit Hospital for further observation.\r\n\r\nNo bacilli have appeared in their sputum for the past three months,\r\nand their phthisical symptoms have gradually and completely\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN WE SEPARATE ANIMALS FROM PLANTS?\r\n\r\nBy ANDREW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the plainest points connected with the study of living things\r\nis the power we apparently possess of separating animals from plants.\r\nSo self-evident appears this power that the popular notion scoffs at\r\nthe idea of science modestly disclaiming its ability to separate the\r\none group of living beings from the other. Is there any danger of\r\nconfusing a bird with the tree amid the foliage of which it builds its\r\nnest, or of mistaking a cow for the grass it eats? These queries are,\r\nof course, answerable in one way only. Unfortunately (for the\r\nquerists), however, they do not include or comprehend the whole\r\ndifficulty. They merely assert, what is perfectly true, that we are\r\nable, without trouble, to mark off the higher animals from the higher\r\nplants. What science inquires is, whether we are able to separate\r\n_all_ animals from _all_ plants, and to fix a definite boundary line,\r\nso as to say that all the organisms on the one side of the line are\r\nassuredly animals, while all the others on the opposite side of the\r\nline may be declared to be truly plants. It is exactly this task which\r\nscience declares to be among the impossibilities of knowledge. Away\r\ndown in the depths of existence and among the groundlings of life the\r\nidentity of living things becomes of a nature which is worse than\r\nconfusing, and which renders it a futile task to attempt to separate\r\nthe two worlds of life. The hopelessness of the task, indeed, has\r\nstruck some observers so forcibly that they have proposed to\r\nconstitute a third kingdom--the _Regnum Protisticum_--between the\r\nanimal and the plant worlds, for the reception of the host of doubtful\r\norganisms. This third kingdom would resemble the casual ward of a\r\nworkhouse, in that it would receive the waifs and strays of life which\r\ncould not find a refuge anywhere else.\r\n\r\nA very slight incursion into biological fields may serve to show forth\r\nthe difficulties of naturalists when the task of separating animals\r\nfrom plants is mooted for discussion. To begin with, if we suppose our\r\npopular disbeliever to assert that animals and plants are always to be\r\ndistinguished by shape and form, it is easy enough to show him that\r\nhere, as elsewhere, appearances are deceptive. What are we to say of a\r\nsponge, or a sea anemone, of corals, of zoophytes growing rooted from\r\noyster shells, of sea squirts, and of sea mats? These, each and all of\r\nthem, are true animals, but they are so plant-like that, as a matter\r\nof fact, they are often mistaken by seaside visitors for plants. This\r\nlast remark holds especially true of the zoophytes and the sea mats.\r\nThen, on the other hand, we can point to hundreds of lower plants,\r\nfrom the yeast plant onward, which show none of the ordinary features\r\nof plant life at all. They possess neither roots, stems, branches,\r\nleaves, nor flowers, so that on this first count of the indictment the\r\nnaturalist gains the day.\r\n\r\nPower of movement, to which the popular doubter is certain to appeal,\r\nis an equally baseless ground of separation. For all the animals I\r\nhave above named are rooted and fixed, while many true plants of lower\r\ngrade are never rooted at all. The yeast plant, the _Algæ_ that swarm\r\nin our ponds, and the diatoms that crowd the waters, exemplify plants\r\nthat are as free as animals; and many of them, besides, in their young\r\nstate especially (e.g., the seaweeds), swim about freely in the water\r\nas if they were roving animalcules. On the second count, also, science\r\ngains the day; power of motion is no legitimate ground at all for\r\ndistinguishing one living being as an animal, while absence of\r\nmovement is similarly no reason for assuming that the fixed organism\r\nmust of necessity be a plant. Then comes the microscopic evidence.\r\nWhat can this wonder glass do in the way of drawing boundary lines\r\nbetwixt the living worlds? The reply again is disappointing to the\r\ndoubter; for the microscope teaches us that the tissues of animals and\r\nplants are built upon kindred lines. We meet with cells and fibers in\r\nboth. The cell is in each case the primitive expression of the whole\r\norganism. Beyond cells and fibers we see the wonderful living\r\nsubstance, _protoplasm_, which is alike to our senses in the two\r\nkingdoms, although, indeed, differing much here and there in the\r\nresults of its work. On purely microscopic grounds, we cannot separate\r\nanimals from plants. There is no justification for rigidly assuming\r\nthat this is a plant or that an animal on account of anything the\r\nmicroscope can disclose. A still more important point in connection\r\nwith this protoplasm question consists in the fact that as we go\r\nbackward to the beginnings of life, both in animals and plants, we\r\nseem to approach nearer and nearer to an identity of substance which\r\nbaffles the microscope with all its powers of discernment. Every\r\nanimal and every plant begins existence as a mere speck of this living\r\njelly. The germ of each is a protoplasm particle, which, whatever\r\ntraces of structure it may exhibit, is practically unrecognizable as\r\nbeing definitely animal or plant in respect of its nature. Later on,\r\nas we know, the egg or germ shows traces of structure in the case of\r\nthe higher animals and plants; while even lowly forms of life exhibit\r\nmore or less characteristic phases when they reach their adult stage.\r\nBut, of life's beginnings, the microscope is as futile as a kind\r\nscientific touchstone for distinguishing animals from plants as is\r\npower of movement, or shape, or form.\r\n\r\nA fourth point of appeal in the matter is found within the domain of\r\nthe chemist. Chemistry, with its subtile powers of analysis, with its\r\nmany-sided possibilities of discovering the composition of things, and\r\nwith its ability to analyze for us even the light of the far distant\r\nstars, only complicates the difficulties of the biologist. For, while\r\nof old it was assumed that a particular element, nitrogen, was\r\npeculiar to animals, and that carbon was an element peculiar to\r\nplants, we now know that both elements are found in animals, just as\r\nboth occur in plants. The chemistry of living things, moreover, when\r\nit did grow to become a staple part of science, revealed other and\r\ngreater anomalies than these. It showed that certain substances which\r\nwere supposed to be peculiar to plants, and to be made and\r\nmanufactured by them alone, were also found in animals. Chlorophyl is\r\nthe green coloring matter of plants, and is, of course, a typical\r\nproduct of the vegetable world; yet it is made by such animals as the\r\nhydra of the brooks and ponds, and by many animalcules and some worms.\r\nStarch is surely a typical plant product, yet it is undoubtedly\r\nmanufactured, or at least stored up, by animals--a work illustrated by\r\nthe liver of man himself, which occasionally produces sugar out of its\r\nstarch.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is a substance called _cellulose_, found well nigh\r\nuniversally in plants. Of this substance, which is akin to starch, the\r\nwalls or envelopes of the cells of plant tissues are composed. Yet we\r\nfind those curious animals, the sea squirts, found on rocks and stones\r\nat low-water mark, manufacturing cellulose to form part and parcel of\r\nthe outer covering of their sac-like bodies. Here it is as if the\r\nanimal, like a dishonest manufacturer, had infringed the patent rights\r\nof the plant. On the fourth count, then--that of chemical\r\ncomposition--the verdict is that nothing that chemistry can teach us\r\nmay serve definitely, clearly, and exactly to set a boundary line or\r\nto erect a partition wall between the two worlds of life. There yet\r\nremains for us to consider a fifth head--that of the food.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the feeding of the two great living worlds we might\r\nperchance light upon some adequate grounds for making up the one\r\nkingdom from the other. What the consideration of form, movement,\r\nchemical composition, and microscopic structure could not effect for\r\nus in this way, it might be supposed the investigation of the diet of\r\nanimals and plants would render clear. Our hopes of distinguishing the\r\none group from the other by reference to the food on which animals and\r\nplants subsist are, however, dashed to the ground; and the diet\r\nquestion leaves us, therefore, when it has been discussed, in the same\r\nquandary as before.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is an interesting story, this of the nutrition of\r\nanimals and plants. A large amount of scientific information is to be\r\ngleaned from such a study, which may very well be commenced by our\r\nhaving regard to the matters on which a _green_ plant feeds. I\r\nemphasize the word \"green,\" because it so happens that when a plant\r\nhas no chlorophyl (as green color is named in the plant world) its\r\nfeeding is of diverse kind to that which a green plant exhibits. The\r\nmushroom or other fungus may be taken as an illustration of a plant\r\nwhich represents the non-green race, while every common plant, from a\r\nbit of grass to an oak tree, exemplifies the green-bearing order of\r\nthe vegetable tribes.\r\n\r\nSuppose we were to invite a green plant to dinner, the _menu_ would\r\nhave to be very differently arranged from that which would satisfy a\r\nhuman or other animal guest. The soup would be represented for the\r\nplant's delectation by water, the fish by minerals, the joint by\r\ncarbonic acid gas, and the dessert by ammonia. On these four items a\r\ngreen plant feeds, out of them it builds up its living frame. Note\r\nthat its diet is of inorganic or non-living matter. It derives its\r\nsustenance from soil and air, yet out of these lifeless matters the\r\ngreen plant elaborates and manufactures its living matter, or\r\nprotoplasm. It is a more wonderful organism than the animal, for while\r\nthe latter can only make new protoplasm when living matter is included\r\nin its food supply, the green plant, by the exercise of its vital\r\nchemistry, can transform that which is not living into that which is\r\nlife-possessing.\r\n\r\nThe green plant in other words, raises non-living into living matter,\r\nwhile the animal can only transform living matters into its like. This\r\nis why the plant is called a constructive organism, while the animal\r\nis, contrariwise, named a destructive one. The result of the plant's\r\nexistence is to build up, that of the animal's life is to break down\r\nits substance, as the result of its work, into non-living matter. The\r\nanimal's body is, in fact, breaking down into the very things on which\r\nthe green plant feeds. We ourselves are perpetually dissipating our\r\nsubstance in our acts of life and work into the carbonic acid, water,\r\nammonia, and minerals on which plants feed. We \"die daily\" in as true\r\na sense as that in which the apostle used the term. And out of the\r\ndebris of the animal frame the green plant builds up leaf and flower,\r\nstein and branch, and all the other tokens of its beauty and its life.\r\n\r\nIf, then, an animal can only live upon living matter--that is to say\r\non the bodies of other animals or of plants--with water, minerals and\r\noxygen gas from the air thrown in to boot, we might be tempted to hold\r\nthat in such distinctive ways and works we had at last found a means\r\nof separating animals from plants. Unfortunately, this view may be\r\nlegitimately disputed and rendered null and void, on two grounds.\r\nFirst of all, the mushrooms and their friends and neighbors, all true\r\nplants, do not feed as do the green tribes. And secondly, many of the\r\ngreen plants themselves can be shown to have taken very kindly to an\r\nanimal mode of diet.\r\n\r\nA mushroom, thus, because it has no green color, lives upon water,\r\noxygen, minerals, and organic matter. You can only grow mushrooms\r\nwhere there is plenty of animal matter in a state of decay, and as for\r\nthe oxygen, they habitually inhale that gas as if they were animals.\r\nNon-green plants thus want a most characteristic action of their green\r\nneighbors. For the latter in daylight take in the carbonic acid gas,\r\nwhich is composed of carbon and oxygen. Under the combined influence\r\nof the green color and the light, they split up the gas into its two\r\nelements, retaining the carbon for food and allowing the oxygen to\r\nescape to the atmosphere. Alas! however, in the dark our green plant\r\nbecomes essentially like an animal as regards its gas food, for then\r\nit is an absorber of oxygen, while it gives off carbonic acid. If to\r\ntake in carbonic acid and to give out oxygen be held to be a feature\r\ncharacteristic of a plant, it is one, as has been well said, which\r\ndisappears with the daylight in green plants, and which is not\r\nwitnessed at all in plants that have no green color.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have seen that not even the food of plants and animals can\r\nseparate the one kingdom of life from the other. The mushroom bars the\r\nway and the green plant's curious behavior by night and by day\r\nrespectively, in the matter of its gas food, once more assimilates\r\nanimal life and plant life in a remarkable manner. Still more\r\ninteresting is the fact, already noticed, that even among the green\r\ntribes there are to be found many and various lapses from the stated\r\nrules of their feeding. Thus what are we to say of the parasitic\r\nmistletoe, which, while it has grown leaves of its own, and can,\r\ntherefore, obtain so much carbon food from the air on its own account,\r\nnevertheless drinks up the sap of the oak or apple which forms its\r\nhost, and thus illustrates the spectacle of a green plant feeding like\r\nan animal, on living matter? Or, what may we think of such plants as\r\nthe sundew, the Venus' fly trap, the pitcher plants, the side saddle\r\nplants, the butterworts and bladderworts, and others of their kind,\r\nwhich not only capture insects, often by ingenious and complex lures,\r\nbut also digest the animal food thus captured? A sundew thus spreads\r\nout its lure in the shape of its leaf studded with sensitive\r\ntentacles, each capped by a glistening drop of gummy secretion.\r\nEntangled in this secretion, the fly is further fixed to the leaf by\r\nthe tentacles which bend over it and inclose it in their fold. Then is\r\npoured out upon the insect's body a digestive acid fluid, and the\r\nsubstance of the dissolved and digested animal is duly absorbed by the\r\nplant. So also the Venus' fly trap captures insects by means of its\r\nleaf, which closes upon the prey when certain sensitive hairs have\r\ngiven the signal that the animal has been trapped. Within the leaf the\r\ninsect is duly digested as before, and its substance applied to the\r\nnutrition of the plant. Such plants, moreover, cannot flourish\r\nperfectly unless duly supplied with their animal food. Such\r\nillustrations of exceptions to the rule of green plant feeding simply\r\nhave the effect of abolishing the distinctions which the diet question\r\nmight be supposed to raise between animals and plants. We may return\r\nto the sundews and other insect catchers; meanwhile, I have said\r\nenough to show that to the question, \"Can we separate animals from\r\nplants?\" a very decided negative reply must be given. Life everywhere\r\nexhibits too many points of contact to admit of any boundary line\r\nbeing drawn between the two great groups which make up the sum total\r\nof organic existence.--_Illustrated London News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECOVERY OF SILVER AND GOLD FROM PLATING AND GILDING SOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the rapid development and extension of the methods of\r\nelectro-plating with silver and gold, and of the large amount of spent\r\nliquors containing silver or gold thus produced, it has long been\r\ndesirable to find methods by which these metals can be recovered from\r\nthe spent liquors. The processes hitherto adopted generally\r\nnecessitate the tedious and unpleasant evaporation of the cyanide\r\nliquors, or else involve a series of chemical operations which are\r\nsomewhat difficult to carry out, so that actually the used-up baths\r\nare sold to some firm which undertakes this recovery as a particular\r\nbranch of its business.\r\n\r\nA process invented by Stockmuir and Fleischmann, and worked out by\r\nthem in the chemical laboratory of the Bavarian Industrial Museum, is,\r\nhowever, exceedingly simple, and is employed in many establishments.\r\n\r\nIn order to remove silver from a potassium cyanide silver solution, it\r\nis only necessary to allow a clean piece of plate zinc to remain in\r\nthe liquid for two days; even better results are obtained by the use\r\nof iron conjointly with the zinc. In the first case, the silver often\r\nadheres firmly to the zinc, while in the second it always separates\r\nout as a powder. It is then only necessary to wash the precipitated\r\npowder, which usually contains copper (since spent silver solutions\r\nalways contain copper), dry it, and then dissolve it in hot\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid, water being added, and the dissolved\r\nsilver precipitated by strips of copper. The silver thus obtained is\r\nperfectly pure. If the amount of copper present is only small, it can\r\nusually be removed by fusing the precipitated powder with a little\r\nniter and borax.\r\n\r\nIn this way a spent silver bath was found to contain per liter\r\n\r\n  1st experiment                     1.5706 grms.\r\n  2d      \"                          1.5694  \"\r\n                                     ------\r\n  Mean                               1.5700  \"\r\n\r\nThe presence of silver could not be qualitatively ascertained in the\r\nresidual liquor.\r\n\r\nAlthough sheet zinc, or zinc and iron sheets, serve so well for the\r\nprecipitation of silver, they cannot be employed for the recovery of\r\ngold. The latter separates out in such a case very incompletely and as\r\na firmly adhering lustrous film in the zinc. On the other hand, finely\r\ndivided zinc, the so-called zinc dust, is an excellent substance to\r\nemploy for precipitating gold quantitatively and in the form of powder\r\nfrom spent cyanide liquors. When zinc dust is added to a spent gold\r\nbath and the liquid periodically stirred or shaken, all the gold is\r\nprecipitated in two or three days. The amount of zinc to be added\r\nnaturally depends on the quantity of gold present. Freshly prepared\r\ngold baths for gilding in the cold contain on the average 3.5 grms.\r\ngold per liter, while those used for the hot process contain 10.75\r\ngrms. To precipitate all the gold in the original bath, 1.74 grms. or\r\n0.37-0.5 grms. zinc dust would be necessary, and, of course, a much\r\nsmaller quantity would be sufficient for the spent liquors. Since the\r\nprecipitation takes place more rapidly when an excess of zinc dust is\r\npresent, it is generally advisable to add ¼ or at the most ½ kilo, of\r\nzinc dust to every 100 liters of solution.\r\n\r\nThe precipitated gold, which contains zinc dust and usually silver and\r\ncopper, is washed, freed from zinc by hydrochloric acid, and then from\r\nsilver and copper by nitric acid and thus obtained pure.\r\n\r\nA spent bath treated in this way gave the following amounts of gold\r\nper liter:\r\n\r\n  1st experiment       0.2626\r\n  2d \"                 0.2634\r\n  Mean                 0.2630 grms.\r\n\r\nThe presence of gold in the residual cyanide solution could not be\r\nqualitatively detected. The potassium cyanide of the solutions\r\nobtained by this process should be converted into ferrocyanide by\r\nheating with ferrous sulphate and milk of lime, since this substance\r\nis not poisonous and can therefore be got rid of without danger. It\r\nwould, however, be more economical and, considering the large amount\r\nof cyanide present, more profitable to work it up into Prussian blue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW CATALOGUE OF VALUABLE PAPERS\r\n\r\nContained in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT during the past ten years,\r\nsent _free of charge_ to any address.
