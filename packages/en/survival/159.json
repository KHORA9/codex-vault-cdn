He gave such a strange\r\naccount of himself that he was supposed demented. Subsequently he\r\nalleged that his mind was a blank from the moment of his escape from\r\nthe _Lady Vain_. His case was discussed among psychologists at the time\r\nas a curious instance of the lapse of memory consequent upon physical\r\nand mental stress. The following narrative was found among his papers\r\nby the undersigned, his nephew and heir, but unaccompanied by any\r\ndefinite request for publication.\r\n\r\nThe only island known to exist in the region in which my uncle was\r\npicked up is Noble’s Isle, a small volcanic islet and uninhabited. It\r\nwas visited in 1891 by _H. M. S. Scorpion_. A party of sailors then\r\nlanded, but found nothing living thereon except certain curious white\r\nmoths, some hogs and rabbits, and some rather peculiar rats. So that\r\nthis narrative is without confirmation in its most essential\r\nparticular. With that understood, there seems no harm in putting this\r\nstrange story before the public in accordance, as I believe, with my\r\nuncle’s intentions. There is at least this much in its behalf: my uncle\r\npassed out of human knowledge about latitude 5° S. and longitude 105°\r\nE., and reappeared in the same part of the ocean after a space of\r\neleven months. In some way he must have lived during the interval. And\r\nit seems that a schooner called the _Ipecacuanha_ with a drunken\r\ncaptain, John Davies, did start from Africa with a puma and certain\r\nother animals aboard in January, 1887, that the vessel was well known\r\nat several ports in the South Pacific, and that it finally disappeared\r\nfrom those seas (with a considerable amount of copra aboard), sailing\r\nto its unknown fate from Bayna in December, 1887, a date that tallies\r\nentirely with my uncle’s story.\r\n\r\nCHARLES EDWARD PRENDICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Island of Doctor Moreau\r\n\r\n(The Story written by Edward Prendick.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\nIN THE DINGEY OF THE “LADY VAIN.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not propose to add anything to what has already been written\r\nconcerning the loss of the _Lady Vain_. As everyone knows, she collided\r\nwith a derelict when ten days out from Callao. The longboat, with seven\r\nof the crew, was picked up eighteen days after by H. M. gunboat\r\n_Myrtle_, and the story of their terrible privations has become quite\r\nas well known as the far more horrible _Medusa_ case. But I have to add\r\nto the published story of the _Lady Vain_ another, possibly as horrible\r\nand far stranger. It has hitherto been supposed that the four men who\r\nwere in the dingey perished, but this is incorrect. I have the best of\r\nevidence for this assertion: I was one of the four men.\r\n\r\nBut in the first place I must state that there never were _four_ men in\r\nthe dingey,—the number was three. Constans, who was “seen by the\r\ncaptain to jump into the gig,”[1] luckily for us and unluckily for\r\nhimself did not reach us. He came down out of the tangle of ropes under\r\nthe stays of the smashed bowsprit, some small rope caught his heel as\r\nhe let go, and he hung for a moment head downward, and then fell and\r\nstruck a block or spar floating in the water. We pulled towards him,\r\nbut he never came up.\r\n\r\n [1] _Daily News_, March 17, 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nI say luckily for us he did not reach us, and I might almost say\r\nluckily for himself; for we had only a small beaker of water and some\r\nsoddened ship’s biscuits with us, so sudden had been the alarm, so\r\nunprepared the ship for any disaster. We thought the people on the\r\nlaunch would be better provisioned (though it seems they were not), and\r\nwe tried to hail them. They could not have heard us, and the next\r\nmorning when the drizzle cleared,—which was not until past midday,—we\r\ncould see nothing of them. We could not stand up to look about us,\r\nbecause of the pitching of the boat. The two other men who had escaped\r\nso far with me were a man named Helmar, a passenger like myself, and a\r\nseaman whose name I don’t know,—a short sturdy man, with a stammer.\r\n\r\nWe drifted famishing, and, after our water had come to an end,\r\ntormented by an intolerable thirst, for eight days altogether. After\r\nthe second day the sea subsided slowly to a glassy calm. It is quite\r\nimpossible for the ordinary reader to imagine those eight days. He has\r\nnot, luckily for himself, anything in his memory to imagine with. After\r\nthe first day we said little to one another, and lay in our places in\r\nthe boat and stared at the horizon, or watched, with eyes that grew\r\nlarger and more haggard every day, the misery and weakness gaining upon\r\nour companions. The sun became pitiless. The water ended on the fourth\r\nday, and we were already thinking strange things and saying them with\r\nour eyes; but it was, I think, the sixth before Helmar gave voice to\r\nthe thing we had all been thinking. I remember our voices were dry and\r\nthin, so that we bent towards one another and spared our words. I stood\r\nout against it with all my might, was rather for scuttling the boat and\r\nperishing together among the sharks that followed us; but when Helmar\r\nsaid that if his proposal was accepted we should have drink, the sailor\r\ncame round to him.\r\n\r\nI would not draw lots however, and in the night the sailor whispered to\r\nHelmar again and again, and I sat in the bows with my clasp-knife in my\r\nhand, though I doubt if I had the stuff in me to fight; and in the\r\nmorning I agreed to Helmar’s proposal, and we handed halfpence to find\r\nthe odd man. The lot fell upon the sailor; but he was the strongest of\r\nus and would not abide by it, and attacked Helmar with his hands. They\r\ngrappled together and almost stood up. I crawled along the boat to\r\nthem, intending to help Helmar by grasping the sailor’s leg; but the\r\nsailor stumbled with the swaying of the boat, and the two fell upon the\r\ngunwale and rolled overboard together. They sank like stones. I\r\nremember laughing at that, and wondering why I laughed. The laugh\r\ncaught me suddenly like a thing from without.\r\n\r\nI lay across one of the thwarts for I know not how long, thinking that\r\nif I had the strength I would drink sea-water and madden myself to die\r\nquickly. And even as I lay there I saw, with no more interest than if\r\nit had been a picture, a sail come up towards me over the sky-line. My\r\nmind must have been wandering, and yet I remember all that happened,\r\nquite distinctly. I remember how my head swayed with the seas, and the\r\nhorizon with the sail above it danced up and down; but I also remember\r\nas distinctly that I had a persuasion that I was dead, and that I\r\nthought what a jest it was that they should come too late by such a\r\nlittle to catch me in my body.\r\n\r\nFor an endless period, as it seemed to me, I lay with my head on the\r\nthwart watching the schooner (she was a little ship, schooner-rigged\r\nfore and aft) come up out of the sea. She kept tacking to and fro in a\r\nwidening compass, for she was sailing dead into the wind. It never\r\nentered my head to attempt to attract attention, and I do not remember\r\nanything distinctly after the sight of her side until I found myself in\r\na little cabin aft. There’s a dim half-memory of being lifted up to the\r\ngangway, and of a big round countenance covered with freckles and\r\nsurrounded with red hair staring at me over the bulwarks. I also had a\r\ndisconnected impression of a dark face, with extraordinary eyes, close\r\nto mine; but that I thought was a nightmare, until I met it again. I\r\nfancy I recollect some stuff being poured in between my teeth; and that\r\nis all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nTHE MAN WHO WAS GOING NOWHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cabin in which I found myself was small and rather untidy. A\r\nyoungish man with flaxen hair, a bristly straw-coloured moustache, and\r\na dropping nether lip, was sitting and holding my wrist. For a minute\r\nwe stared at each other without speaking. He had watery grey eyes,\r\noddly void of expression. Then just overhead came a sound like an iron\r\nbedstead being knocked about, and the low angry growling of some large\r\nanimal. At the same time the man spoke. He repeated his question,—“How\r\ndo you feel now?”\r\n\r\nI think I said I felt all right. I could not recollect how I had got\r\nthere. He must have seen the question in my face, for my voice was\r\ninaccessible to me.\r\n\r\n“You were picked up in a boat, starving. The name on the boat was the\r\n_Lady Vain_, and there were spots of blood on the gunwale.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time my eye caught my hand, so thin that it looked like a\r\ndirty skin-purse full of loose bones, and all the business of the boat\r\ncame back to me.\r\n\r\n“Have some of this,” said he, and gave me a dose of some scarlet stuff,\r\niced.\r\n\r\nIt tasted like blood, and made me feel stronger.\r\n\r\n“You were in luck,” said he, “to get picked up by a ship with a medical\r\nman aboard.” He spoke with a slobbering articulation, with the ghost of\r\na lisp.\r\n\r\n“What ship is this?” I said slowly, hoarse from my long silence.\r\n\r\n“It’s a little trader from Arica and Callao. I never asked where she\r\ncame from in the beginning,—out of the land of born fools, I guess. I’m\r\na passenger myself, from Arica. The silly ass who owns her,—he’s\r\ncaptain too, named Davies,—he’s lost his certificate, or something. You\r\nknow the kind of man,—calls the thing the _Ipecacuanha_, of all silly,\r\ninfernal names; though when there’s much of a sea without any wind, she\r\ncertainly acts according.”\r\n\r\n(Then the noise overhead began again, a snarling growl and the voice of\r\na human being together. Then another voice, telling some\r\n“Heaven-forsaken idiot” to desist.)\r\n\r\n“You were nearly dead,” said my interlocutor. “It was a very near\r\nthing, indeed. But I’ve put some stuff into you now. Notice your arm’s\r\nsore? Injections. You’ve been insensible for nearly thirty hours.”\r\n\r\nI thought slowly. (I was distracted now by the yelping of a number of\r\ndogs.) “Am I eligible for solid food?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Thanks to me,” he said. “Even now the mutton is boiling.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said with assurance; “I could eat some mutton.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said he with a momentary hesitation, “you know I’m dying to hear\r\nof how you came to be alone in that boat. _Damn that howling_!” I\r\nthought I detected a certain suspicion in his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly left the cabin, and I heard him in violent controversy with\r\nsome one, who seemed to me to talk gibberish in response to him. The\r\nmatter sounded as though it ended in blows, but in that I thought my\r\nears were mistaken. Then he shouted at the dogs, and returned to the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said he in the doorway. “You were just beginning to tell me.”\r\n\r\nI told him my name, Edward Prendick, and how I had taken to Natural\r\nHistory as a relief from the dulness of my comfortable independence.\r\n\r\nHe seemed interested in this. “I’ve done some science myself. I did my\r\nBiology at University College,—getting out the ovary of the earthworm\r\nand the radula of the snail, and all that. Lord! It’s ten years ago.\r\nBut go on! go on! tell me about the boat.”\r\n\r\nHe was evidently satisfied with the frankness of my story, which I told\r\nin concise sentences enough, for I felt horribly weak; and when it was\r\nfinished he reverted at once to the topic of Natural History and his\r\nown biological studies. He began to question me closely about Tottenham\r\nCourt Road and Gower Street. “Is Caplatzi still flourishing? What a\r\nshop that was!” He had evidently been a very ordinary medical student,\r\nand drifted incontinently to the topic of the music halls. He told me\r\nsome anecdotes.\r\n\r\n“Left it all,” he said, “ten years ago. How jolly it all used to be!\r\nBut I made a young ass of myself,—played myself out before I was\r\ntwenty-one. I daresay it’s all different now. But I must look up that\r\nass of a cook, and see what he’s done to your mutton.”\r\n\r\nThe growling overhead was renewed, so suddenly and with so much savage\r\nanger that it startled me. “What’s that?” I called after him, but the\r\ndoor had closed. He came back again with the boiled mutton, and I was\r\nso excited by the appetising smell of it that I forgot the noise of the\r\nbeast that had troubled me.\r\n\r\nAfter a day of alternate sleep and feeding I was so far recovered as to\r\nbe able to get from my bunk to the scuttle, and see the green seas\r\ntrying to keep pace with us. I judged the schooner was running before\r\nthe wind. Montgomery—that was the name of the flaxen-haired man—came in\r\nagain as I stood there, and I asked him for some clothes. He lent me\r\nsome duck things of his own, for those I had worn in the boat had been\r\nthrown overboard. They were rather loose for me, for he was large and\r\nlong in his limbs. He told me casually that the captain was three-parts\r\ndrunk in his own cabin. As I assumed the clothes, I began asking him\r\nsome questions about the destination of the ship. He said the ship was\r\nbound to Hawaii, but that it had to land him first.\r\n\r\n“Where?” said I.\r\n\r\n“It’s an island, where I live. So far as I know, it hasn’t got a name.”\r\n\r\nHe stared at me with his nether lip dropping, and looked so wilfully\r\nstupid of a sudden that it came into my head that he desired to avoid\r\nmy questions. I had the discretion to ask no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nTHE STRANGE FACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left the cabin and found a man at the companion obstructing our way.\r\nHe was standing on the ladder with his back to us, peering over the\r\ncombing of the hatchway. He was, I could see, a misshapen man, short,\r\nbroad, and clumsy, with a crooked back, a hairy neck, and a head sunk\r\nbetween his shoulders. He was dressed in dark-blue serge, and had\r\npeculiarly thick, coarse, black hair. I heard the unseen dogs growl\r\nfuriously, and forthwith he ducked back,—coming into contact with the\r\nhand I put out to fend him off from myself. He turned with animal\r\nswiftness.\r\n\r\nIn some indefinable way the black face thus flashed upon me shocked me\r\nprofoundly. It was a singularly deformed one. The facial part\r\nprojected, forming something dimly suggestive of a muzzle, and the huge\r\nhalf-open mouth showed as big white teeth as I had ever seen in a human\r\nmouth. His eyes were blood-shot at the edges, with scarcely a rim of\r\nwhite round the hazel pupils. There was a curious glow of excitement in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n“Confound you!” said Montgomery. “Why the devil don’t you get out of\r\nthe way?”\r\n\r\nThe black-faced man started aside without a word. I went on up the\r\ncompanion, staring at him instinctively as I did so. Montgomery stayed\r\nat the foot for a moment. “You have no business here, you know,” he\r\nsaid in a deliberate tone. “Your place is forward.”\r\n\r\nThe black-faced man cowered. “They—won’t have me forward.” He spoke\r\nslowly, with a queer, hoarse quality in his voice.\r\n\r\n“Won’t have you forward!” said Montgomery, in a menacing voice. “But I\r\ntell you to go!” He was on the brink of saying something further, then\r\nlooked up at me suddenly and followed me up the ladder.\r\n\r\nI had paused half way through the hatchway, looking back, still\r\nastonished beyond measure at the grotesque ugliness of this black-faced\r\ncreature. I had never beheld such a repulsive and extraordinary face\r\nbefore, and yet—if the contradiction is credible—I experienced at the\r\nsame time an odd feeling that in some way I _had_ already encountered\r\nexactly the features and gestures that now amazed me. Afterwards it\r\noccurred to me that probably I had seen him as I was lifted aboard; and\r\nyet that scarcely satisfied my suspicion of a previous acquaintance.\r\nYet how one could have set eyes on so singular a face and yet have\r\nforgotten the precise occasion, passed my imagination.\r\n\r\nMontgomery’s movement to follow me released my attention, and I turned\r\nand looked about me at the flush deck of the little schooner. I was\r\nalready half prepared by the sounds I had heard for what I saw.\r\nCertainly I never beheld a deck so dirty. It was littered with scraps\r\nof carrot, shreds of green stuff, and indescribable filth. Fastened by\r\nchains to the mainmast were a number of grisly staghounds, who now\r\nbegan leaping and barking at me, and by the mizzen a huge puma was\r\ncramped in a little iron cage far too small even to give it turning\r\nroom. Farther under the starboard bulwark were some big hutches\r\ncontaining a number of rabbits, and a solitary llama was squeezed in a\r\nmere box of a cage forward. The dogs were muzzled by leather straps.\r\nThe only human being on deck was a gaunt and silent sailor at the\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nThe patched and dirty spankers were tense before the wind, and up aloft\r\nthe little ship seemed carrying every sail she had. The sky was clear,\r\nthe sun midway down the western sky; long waves, capped by the breeze\r\nwith froth, were running with us. We went past the steersman to the\r\ntaffrail, and saw the water come foaming under the stern and the\r\nbubbles go dancing and vanishing in her wake. I turned and surveyed the\r\nunsavoury length of the ship.\r\n\r\n“Is this an ocean menagerie?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Looks like it,” said Montgomery.\r\n\r\n“What are these beasts for? Merchandise, curios? Does the captain think\r\nhe is going to sell them somewhere in the South Seas?”\r\n\r\n“It looks like it, doesn’t it?” said Montgomery, and turned towards the\r\nwake again.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we heard a yelp and a volley of furious blasphemy from the\r\ncompanion hatchway, and the deformed man with the black face came up\r\nhurriedly. He was immediately followed by a heavy red-haired man in a\r\nwhite cap. At the sight of the former the staghounds, who had all tired\r\nof barking at me by this time, became furiously excited, howling and\r\nleaping against their chains. The black hesitated before them, and this\r\ngave the red-haired man time to come up with him and deliver a\r\ntremendous blow between the shoulder-blades. The poor devil went down\r\nlike a felled ox, and rolled in the dirt among the furiously excited\r\ndogs. It was lucky for him that they were muzzled. The red-haired man\r\ngave a yawp of exultation and stood staggering, and as it seemed to me\r\nin serious danger of either going backwards down the companion hatchway\r\nor forwards upon his victim.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the second man had appeared, Montgomery had started forward.\r\n“Steady on there!” he cried, in a tone of remonstrance. A couple of\r\nsailors appeared on the forecastle. The black-faced man, howling in a\r\nsingular voice rolled about under the feet of the dogs. No one\r\nattempted to help him. The brutes did their best to worry him, butting\r\ntheir muzzles at him. There was a quick dance of their lithe\r\ngrey-figured bodies over the clumsy, prostrate figure. The sailors\r\nforward shouted, as though it was admirable sport. Montgomery gave an\r\nangry exclamation, and went striding down the deck, and I followed him.\r\nThe black-faced man scrambled up and staggered forward, going and\r\nleaning over the bulwark by the main shrouds, where he remained,\r\npanting and glaring over his shoulder at the dogs. The red-haired man\r\nlaughed a satisfied laugh.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Captain,” said Montgomery, with his lisp a little\r\naccentuated, gripping the elbows of the red-haired man, “this won’t\r\ndo!”\r\n\r\nI stood behind Montgomery. The captain came half round, and regarded\r\nhim with the dull and solemn eyes of a drunken man. “Wha’ won’t do?” he\r\nsaid, and added, after looking sleepily into Montgomery’s face for a\r\nminute, “Blasted Sawbones!”\r\n\r\nWith a sudden movement he shook his arms free, and after two\r\nineffectual attempts stuck his freckled fists into his side pockets.\r\n\r\n“That man’s a passenger,” said Montgomery. “I’d advise you to keep your\r\nhands off him.”\r\n\r\n“Go to hell!” said the captain, loudly. He suddenly turned and\r\nstaggered towards the side. “Do what I like on my own ship,” he said.\r\n\r\nI think Montgomery might have left him then, seeing the brute was\r\ndrunk; but he only turned a shade paler, and followed the captain to\r\nthe bulwarks.\r\n\r\n“Look you here, Captain,” he said; “that man of mine is not to be\r\nill-treated. He has been hazed ever since he came aboard.”\r\n\r\nFor a minute, alcoholic fumes kept the captain speechless. “Blasted\r\nSawbones!” was all he considered necessary.\r\n\r\nI could see that Montgomery had one of those slow, pertinacious tempers\r\nthat will warm day after day to a white heat, and never again cool to\r\nforgiveness; and I saw too that this quarrel had been some time\r\ngrowing. “The man’s drunk,” said I, perhaps officiously; “you’ll do no\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\nMontgomery gave an ugly twist to his dropping lip. “He’s always drunk.\r\nDo you think that excuses his assaulting his passengers?”\r\n\r\n“My ship,” began the captain, waving his hand unsteadily towards the\r\ncages, “was a clean ship. Look at it now!” It was certainly anything\r\nbut clean. “Crew,” continued the captain, “clean, respectable crew.”\r\n\r\n“You agreed to take the beasts.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I’d never set eyes on your infernal island. What the devil—want\r\nbeasts for on an island like that? Then, that man of yours—understood\r\nhe was a man. He’s a lunatic; and he hadn’t no business aft. Do you\r\nthink the whole damned ship belongs to you?”\r\n\r\n“Your sailors began to haze the poor devil as soon as he came aboard.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what he is—he’s a devil! an ugly devil! My men can’t stand\r\nhim. _I_ can’t stand him. None of us can’t stand him. Nor _you_\r\neither!”\r\n\r\nMontgomery turned away. “_You_ leave that man alone, anyhow,” he said,\r\nnodding his head as he spoke.\r\n\r\nBut the captain meant to quarrel now. He raised his voice. “If he comes\r\nthis end of the ship again I’ll cut his insides out, I tell you. Cut\r\nout his blasted insides! Who are _you_, to tell _me_ what _I’m_ to do?\r\nI tell you I’m captain of this ship,—captain and owner. I’m the law\r\nhere, I tell you,—the law and the prophets. I bargained to take a man\r\nand his attendant to and from Arica, and bring back some animals. I\r\nnever bargained to carry a mad devil and a silly Sawbones, a—”\r\n\r\nWell, never mind what he called Montgomery. I saw the latter take a\r\nstep forward, and interposed. “He’s drunk,” said I. The captain began\r\nsome abuse even fouler than the last. “Shut up!” I said, turning on him\r\nsharply, for I had seen danger in Montgomery’s white face. With that I\r\nbrought the downpour on myself.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was glad to avert what was uncommonly near a scuffle, even\r\nat the price of the captain’s drunken ill-will. I do not think I have\r\never heard quite so much vile language come in a continuous stream from\r\nany man’s lips before, though I have frequented eccentric company\r\nenough. I found some of it hard to endure, though I am a mild-tempered\r\nman; but, certainly, when I told the captain to “shut up” I had\r\nforgotten that I was merely a bit of human flotsam, cut off from my\r\nresources and with my fare unpaid; a mere casual dependant on the\r\nbounty, or speculative enterprise, of the ship. He reminded me of it\r\nwith considerable vigour; but at any rate I prevented a fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nAT THE SCHOONER’S RAIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night land was sighted after sundown, and the schooner hove to.\r\nMontgomery intimated that was his destination. It was too far to see\r\nany details; it seemed to me then simply a low-lying patch of dim blue\r\nin the uncertain blue-grey sea. An almost vertical streak of smoke went\r\nup from it into the sky. The captain was not on deck when it was\r\nsighted. After he had vented his wrath on me he had staggered below,\r\nand I understand he went to sleep on the floor of his own cabin. The\r\nmate practically assumed the command. He was the gaunt, taciturn\r\nindividual we had seen at the wheel. Apparently he was in an evil\r\ntemper with Montgomery. He took not the slightest notice of either of\r\nus. We dined with him in a sulky silence, after a few ineffectual\r\nefforts on my part to talk. It struck me too that the men regarded my\r\ncompanion and his animals in a singularly unfriendly manner. I found\r\nMontgomery very reticent about his purpose with these creatures, and\r\nabout his destination; and though I was sensible of a growing curiosity\r\nas to both, I did not press him.\r\n\r\nWe remained talking on the quarter deck until the sky was thick with\r\nstars. Except for an occasional sound in the yellow-lit forecastle and\r\na movement of the animals now and then, the night was very still. The\r\npuma lay crouched together, watching us with shining eyes, a black heap\r\nin the corner of its cage. Montgomery produced some cigars. He talked\r\nto me of London in a tone of half-painful reminiscence, asking all\r\nkinds of questions about changes that had taken place. He spoke like a\r\nman who had loved his life there, and had been suddenly and irrevocably\r\ncut off from it. I gossiped as well as I could of this and that. All\r\nthe time the strangeness of him was shaping itself in my mind; and as I\r\ntalked I peered at his odd, pallid face in the dim light of the\r\nbinnacle lantern behind me. Then I looked out at the darkling sea,\r\nwhere in the dimness his little island was hidden.\r\n\r\nThis man, it seemed to me, had come out of Immensity merely to save my\r\nlife. To-morrow he would drop over the side, and vanish again out of my\r\nexistence. Even had it been under commonplace circumstances, it would\r\nhave made me a trifle thoughtful; but in the first place was the\r\nsingularity of an educated man living on this unknown little island,\r\nand coupled with that the extraordinary nature of his luggage. I found\r\nmyself repeating the captain’s question. What did he want with the\r\nbeasts? Why, too, had he pretended they were not his when I had\r\nremarked about them at first? Then, again, in his personal attendant\r\nthere was a bizarre quality which had impressed me profoundly. These\r\ncircumstances threw a haze of mystery round the man. They laid hold of\r\nmy imagination, and hampered my tongue.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight our talk of London died away, and we stood side by\r\nside leaning over the bulwarks and staring dreamily over the silent,\r\nstarlit sea, each pursuing his own thoughts. It was the atmosphere for\r\nsentiment, and I began upon my gratitude.\r\n\r\n“If I may say it,” said I, after a time, “you have saved my life.”\r\n\r\n“Chance,” he answered. “Just chance.”\r\n\r\n“I prefer to make my thanks to the accessible agent.”\r\n\r\n“Thank no one. You had the need, and I had the knowledge; and I\r\ninjected and fed you much as I might have collected a specimen. I was\r\nbored and wanted something to do. If I’d been jaded that day, or hadn’t\r\nliked your face, well—it’s a curious question where you would have been\r\nnow!”\r\n\r\nThis damped my mood a little. “At any rate,” I began.\r\n\r\n“It’s a chance, I tell you,” he interrupted, “as everything is in a\r\nman’s life. Only the asses won’t see it! Why am I here now, an outcast\r\nfrom civilisation, instead of being a happy man enjoying all the\r\npleasures of London? Simply because eleven years ago—I lost my head for\r\nten minutes on a foggy night.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped. “Yes?” said I.\r\n\r\n“That’s all.”\r\n\r\nWe relapsed into silence. Presently he laughed. “There’s something in\r\nthis starlight that loosens one’s tongue. I’m an ass, and yet somehow I\r\nwould like to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Whatever you tell me, you may rely upon my keeping to myself—if that’s\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nHe was on the point of beginning, and then shook his head, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Don’t,” said I. “It is all the same to me. After all, it is better to\r\nkeep your secret. There’s nothing gained but a little relief if I\r\nrespect your confidence. If I don’t—well?”\r\n\r\nHe grunted undecidedly. I felt I had him at a disadvantage, had caught\r\nhim in the mood of indiscretion; and to tell the truth I was not\r\ncurious to learn what might have driven a young medical student out of\r\nLondon. I have an imagination. I shrugged my shoulders and turned away.\r\nOver the taffrail leant a silent black figure, watching the stars. It\r\nwas Montgomery’s strange attendant. It looked over its shoulder quickly\r\nwith my movement, then looked away again.\r\n\r\nIt may seem a little thing to you, perhaps, but it came like a sudden\r\nblow to me. The only light near us was a lantern at the wheel. The\r\ncreature’s face was turned for one brief instant out of the dimness of\r\nthe stern towards this illumination, and I saw that the eyes that\r\nglanced at me shone with a pale-green light. I did not know then that a\r\nreddish luminosity, at least, is not uncommon in human eyes. The thing\r\ncame to me as stark inhumanity. That black figure with its eyes of fire\r\nstruck down through all my adult thoughts and feelings, and for a\r\nmoment the forgotten horrors of childhood came back to my mind. Then\r\nthe effect passed as it had come. An uncouth black figure of a man, a\r\nfigure of no particular import, hung over the taffrail against the\r\nstarlight, and I found Montgomery was speaking to me.\r\n\r\n“I’m thinking of turning in, then,” said he, “if you’ve had enough of\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\nI answered him incongruously. We went below, and he wished me\r\ngood-night at the door of my cabin.\r\n\r\nThat night I had some very unpleasant dreams. The waning moon rose\r\nlate. Its light struck a ghostly white beam across my cabin, and made\r\nan ominous shape on the planking by my bunk. Then the staghounds woke,\r\nand began howling and baying; so that I dreamt fitfully, and scarcely\r\nslept until the approach of dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nTHE MAN WHO HAD NOWHERE TO GO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early morning (it was the second morning after my recovery, and\r\nI believe the fourth after I was picked up), I awoke through an avenue\r\nof tumultuous dreams,—dreams of guns and howling mobs,—and became\r\nsensible of a hoarse shouting above me. I rubbed my eyes and lay\r\nlistening to the noise, doubtful for a little while of my whereabouts.\r\nThen came a sudden pattering of bare feet, the sound of heavy objects\r\nbeing thrown about, a violent creaking and the rattling of chains. I\r\nheard the swish of the water as the ship was suddenly brought round,\r\nand a foamy yellow-green wave flew across the little round window and\r\nleft it streaming. I jumped into my clothes and went on deck.\r\n\r\nAs I came up the ladder I saw against the flushed sky—for the sun was\r\njust rising—the broad back and red hair of the captain, and over his\r\nshoulder the puma spinning from a tackle rigged on to the mizzen\r\nspanker-boom.\r\n\r\nThe poor brute seemed horribly scared, and crouched in the bottom of\r\nits little cage.\r\n\r\n“Overboard with ’em!” bawled the captain. “Overboard with ’em! We’ll\r\nhave a clean ship soon of the whole bilin’ of ’em.”\r\n\r\nHe stood in my way, so that I had perforce to tap his shoulder to come\r\non deck. He came round with a start, and staggered back a few paces to\r\nstare at me. It needed no expert eye to tell that the man was still\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” said he, stupidly; and then with a light coming into his eyes,\r\n“Why, it’s Mister—Mister?”\r\n\r\n“Prendick,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Prendick be damned!” said he. “Shut-up,—that’s your name. Mister\r\nShut-up.”\r\n\r\nIt was no good answering the brute; but I certainly did not expect his\r\nnext move. He held out his hand to the gangway by which Montgomery\r\nstood talking to a massive grey-haired man in dirty-blue flannels, who\r\nhad apparently just come aboard.\r\n\r\n“That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up! that way!” roared the captain.\r\n\r\nMontgomery and his companion turned as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I said.\r\n\r\n“That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up,—that’s what I mean! Overboard,\r\nMister Shut-up,—and sharp! We’re cleaning the ship out,—cleaning the\r\nwhole blessed ship out; and overboard you go!”\r\n\r\nI stared at him dumfounded. Then it occurred to me that it was exactly\r\nthe thing I wanted. The lost prospect of a journey as sole passenger\r\nwith this quarrelsome sot was not one to mourn over. I turned towards\r\nMontgomery.\r\n\r\n“Can’t have you,” said Montgomery’s companion, concisely.\r\n\r\n“You can’t have me!” said I, aghast. He had the squarest and most\r\nresolute face I ever set eyes upon.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” I began, turning to the captain.\r\n\r\n“Overboard!” said the captain. “This ship aint for beasts and cannibals\r\nand worse than beasts, any more. Overboard you go, Mister Shut-up. If\r\nthey can’t have you, you goes overboard. But, anyhow, you go—with your\r\nfriends. I’ve done with this blessed island for evermore, amen! I’ve\r\nhad enough of it.”\r\n\r\n“But, Montgomery,” I appealed.\r\n\r\nHe distorted his lower lip, and nodded his head hopelessly at the\r\ngrey-haired man beside him, to indicate his powerlessness to help me.\r\n\r\n“I’ll see to _you_, presently,” said the captain.\r\n\r\nThen began a curious three-cornered altercation. Alternately I appealed\r\nto one and another of the three men,—first to the grey-haired man to\r\nlet me land, and then to the drunken captain to keep me aboard. I even\r\nbawled entreaties to the sailors. Montgomery said never a word, only\r\nshook his head. “You’re going overboard, I tell you,” was the captain’s\r\nrefrain. “Law be damned! I’m king here.” At last I must confess my\r\nvoice suddenly broke in the middle of a vigorous threat. I felt a gust\r\nof hysterical petulance, and went aft and stared dismally at nothing.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the task of unshipping\r\nthe packages and caged animals. A large launch, with two standing lugs,\r\nlay under the lee of the schooner; and into this the strange assortment\r\nof goods were swung. I did not then see the hands from the island that\r\nwere receiving the packages, for the hull of the launch was hidden from\r\nme by the side of the schooner. Neither Montgomery nor his companion\r\ntook the slightest notice of me, but busied themselves in assisting and\r\ndirecting the four or five sailors who were unloading the goods. The\r\ncaptain went forward interfering rather than assisting. I was\r\nalternately despairful and desperate. Once or twice as I stood waiting\r\nthere for things to accomplish themselves, I could not resist an\r\nimpulse to laugh at my miserable quandary. I felt all the wretcheder\r\nfor the lack of a breakfast. Hunger and a lack of blood-corpuscles take\r\nall the manhood from a man. I perceived pretty clearly that I had not\r\nthe stamina either to resist what the captain chose to do to expel me,\r\nor to force myself upon Montgomery and his companion. So I waited\r\npassively upon fate; and the work of transferring Montgomery’s\r\npossessions to the launch went on as if I did not exist.\r\n\r\nPresently that work was finished, and then came a struggle. I was\r\nhauled, resisting weakly enough, to the gangway. Even then I noticed\r\nthe oddness of the brown faces of the men who were with Montgomery in\r\nthe launch; but the launch was now fully laden, and was shoved off\r\nhastily. A broadening gap of green water appeared under me, and I\r\npushed back with all my strength to avoid falling headlong. The hands\r\nin the launch shouted derisively, and I heard Montgomery curse at them;\r\nand then the captain, the mate, and one of the seamen helping him, ran\r\nme aft towards the stern.\r\n\r\nThe dingey of the _Lady Vain_ had been towing behind; it was half full\r\nof water, had no oars, and was quite unvictualled. I refused to go\r\naboard her, and flung myself full length on the deck. In the end, they\r\nswung me into her by a rope (for they had no stern ladder), and then\r\nthey cut me adrift. I drifted slowly from the schooner. In a kind of\r\nstupor I watched all hands take to the rigging, and slowly but surely\r\nshe came round to the wind; the sails fluttered, and then bellied out\r\nas the wind came into them. I stared at her weather-beaten side heeling\r\nsteeply towards me; and then she passed out of my range of view.\r\n\r\nI did not turn my head to follow her. At first I could scarcely believe\r\nwhat had happened. I crouched in the bottom of the dingey, stunned, and\r\nstaring blankly at the vacant, oily sea. Then I realised that I was in\r\nthat little hell of mine again, now half swamped; and looking back over\r\nthe gunwale, I saw the schooner standing away from me, with the\r\nred-haired captain mocking at me over the taffrail, and turning towards\r\nthe island saw the launch growing smaller as she approached the beach.\r\n\r\nAbruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear to me. I had no\r\nmeans of reaching the land unless I should chance to drift there. I was\r\nstill weak, you must remember, from my exposure in the boat; I was\r\nempty and very faint, or I should have had more heart. But as it was I\r\nsuddenly began to sob and weep, as I had never done since I was a\r\nlittle child. The tears ran down my face. In a passion of despair I\r\nstruck with my fists at the water in the bottom of the boat, and kicked\r\nsavagely at the gunwale. I prayed aloud for God to let me die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nTHE EVIL-LOOKING BOATMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the islanders, seeing that I was really adrift, took pity on me. I\r\ndrifted very slowly to the eastward, approaching the island slantingly;\r\nand presently I saw, with hysterical relief, the launch come round and\r\nreturn towards me. She was heavily laden, and I could make out as she\r\ndrew nearer Montgomery’s white-haired, broad-shouldered companion\r\nsitting cramped up with the dogs and several packing-cases in the stern\r\nsheets. This individual stared fixedly at me without moving or\r\nspeaking. The black-faced cripple was glaring at me as fixedly in the\r\nbows near the puma. There were three other men besides,—three strange\r\nbrutish-looking fellows, at whom the staghounds were snarling savagely.\r\nMontgomery, who was steering, brought the boat by me, and rising,\r\ncaught and fastened my painter to the tiller to tow me, for there was\r\nno room aboard.\r\n\r\nI had recovered from my hysterical phase by this time and answered his\r\nhail, as he approached, bravely enough. I told him the dingey was\r\nnearly swamped, and he reached me a piggin. I was jerked back as the\r\nrope tightened between the boats. For some time I was busy baling.\r\n\r\nIt was not until I had got the water under (for the water in the dingey\r\nhad been shipped; the boat was perfectly sound) that I had leisure to\r\nlook at the people in the launch again.\r\n\r\nThe white-haired man I found was still regarding me steadfastly, but\r\nwith an expression, as I now fancied, of some perplexity. When my eyes\r\nmet his, he looked down at the staghound that sat between his knees. He\r\nwas a powerfully-built man, as I have said, with a fine forehead and\r\nrather heavy features; but his eyes had that odd drooping of the skin\r\nabove the lids which often comes with advancing years, and the fall of\r\nhis heavy mouth at the corners gave him an expression of pugnacious\r\nresolution. He talked to Montgomery in a tone too low for me to hear.\r\n\r\nFrom him my eyes travelled to his three men; and a strange crew they\r\nwere. I saw only their faces, yet there was something in their faces—I\r\nknew not what—that gave me a queer spasm of disgust. I looked steadily\r\nat them, and the impression did not pass, though I failed to see what\r\nhad occasioned it. They seemed to me then to be brown men; but their\r\nlimbs were oddly swathed in some thin, dirty, white stuff down even to\r\nthe fingers and feet: I have never seen men so wrapped up before, and\r\nwomen so only in the East. They wore turbans too, and thereunder peered\r\nout their elfin faces at me,—faces with protruding lower-jaws and\r\nbright eyes. They had lank black hair, almost like horsehair, and\r\nseemed as they sat to exceed in stature any race of men I have seen.\r\nThe white-haired man, who I knew was a good six feet in height, sat a\r\nhead below any one of the three. I found afterwards that really none\r\nwere taller than myself; but their bodies were abnormally long, and the\r\nthigh-part of the leg short and curiously twisted. At any rate, they\r\nwere an amazingly ugly gang, and over the heads of them under the\r\nforward lug peered the black face of the man whose eyes were luminous\r\nin the dark. As I stared at them, they met my gaze; and then first one\r\nand then another turned away from my direct stare, and looked at me in\r\nan odd, furtive manner. It occurred to me that I was perhaps annoying\r\nthem, and I turned my attention to the island we were approaching.\r\n\r\nIt was low, and covered with thick vegetation,—chiefly a kind of palm,\r\nthat was new to me. From one point a thin white thread of vapour rose\r\nslantingly to an immense height, and then frayed out like a down\r\nfeather. We were now within the embrace of a broad bay flanked on\r\neither hand by a low promontory. The beach was of dull-grey sand, and\r\nsloped steeply up to a ridge, perhaps sixty or seventy feet above the\r\nsea-level, and irregularly set with trees and undergrowth. Half way up\r\nwas a square enclosure of some greyish stone, which I found\r\nsubsequently was built partly of coral and partly of pumiceous lava.\r\nTwo thatched roofs peeped from within this enclosure. A man stood\r\nawaiting us at the water’s edge. I fancied while we were still far off\r\nthat I saw some other and very grotesque-looking creatures scuttle into\r\nthe bushes upon the slope; but I saw nothing of these as we drew\r\nnearer. This man was of a moderate size, and with a black negroid face.\r\nHe had a large, almost lipless, mouth, extraordinary lank arms, long\r\nthin feet, and bow-legs, and stood with his heavy face thrust forward\r\nstaring at us. He was dressed like Montgomery and his white-haired\r\ncompanion, in jacket and trousers of blue serge. As we came still\r\nnearer, this individual began to run to and fro on the beach, making\r\nthe most grotesque movements.\r\n\r\nAt a word of command from Montgomery, the four men in the launch sprang\r\nup, and with singularly awkward gestures struck the lugs. Montgomery\r\nsteered us round and into a narrow little dock excavated in the beach.\r\nThen the man on the beach hastened towards us. This dock, as I call it,\r\nwas really a mere ditch just long enough at this phase of the tide to\r\ntake the longboat. I heard the bows ground in the sand, staved the\r\ndingey off the rudder of the big boat with my piggin, and freeing the\r\npainter, landed. The three muffled men, with the clumsiest movements,\r\nscrambled out upon the sand, and forthwith set to landing the cargo,\r\nassisted by the man on the beach. I was struck especially by the\r\ncurious movements of the legs of the three swathed and bandaged\r\nboatmen,—not stiff they were, but distorted in some odd way, almost as\r\nif they were jointed in the wrong place. The dogs were still snarling,\r\nand strained at their chains after these men, as the white-haired man\r\nlanded with them. The three big fellows spoke to one another in odd\r\nguttural tones, and the man who had waited for us on the beach began\r\nchattering to them excitedly—a foreign language, as I fancied—as they\r\nlaid hands on some bales piled near the stern. Somewhere I had heard\r\nsuch a voice before, and I could not think where. The white-haired man\r\nstood, holding in a tumult of six dogs, and bawling orders over their\r\ndin. Montgomery, having unshipped the rudder, landed likewise, and all\r\nset to work at unloading. I was too faint, what with my long fast and\r\nthe sun beating down on my bare head, to offer any assistance.\r\n\r\nPresently the white-haired man seemed to recollect my presence, and\r\ncame up to me.\r\n\r\n“You look,” said he, “as though you had scarcely breakfasted.” His\r\nlittle eyes were a brilliant black under his heavy brows. “I must\r\napologise for that. Now you are our guest, we must make you\r\ncomfortable,—though you are uninvited, you know.” He looked keenly into\r\nmy face. “Montgomery says you are an educated man, Mr. Prendick; says\r\nyou know something of science. May I ask what that signifies?”\r\n\r\nI told him I had spent some years at the Royal College of Science, and\r\nhad done some researches in biology under Huxley. He raised his\r\neyebrows slightly at that.\r\n\r\n“That alters the case a little, Mr. Prendick,” he said, with a trifle\r\nmore respect in his manner. “As it happens, we are biologists here.\r\nThis is a biological station—of a sort.” His eye rested on the men in\r\nwhite who were busily hauling the puma, on rollers, towards the walled\r\nyard. “I and Montgomery, at least,” he added. Then, “When you will be\r\nable to get away, I can’t say. We’re off the track to anywhere. We see\r\na ship once in a twelve-month or so.”\r\n\r\nHe left me abruptly, and went up the beach past this group, and I think\r\nentered the enclosure. The other two men were with Montgomery, erecting\r\na pile of smaller packages on a low-wheeled truck. The llama was still\r\non the launch with the rabbit hutches; the staghounds were still lashed\r\nto the thwarts. The pile of things completed, all three men laid hold\r\nof the truck and began shoving the ton-weight or so upon it after the\r\npuma. Presently Montgomery left them, and coming back to me held out\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad,” said he, “for my own part. That captain was a silly ass.\r\nHe’d have made things lively for you.”\r\n\r\n“It was you,” said I, “that saved me again.”\r\n\r\n“That depends. You’ll find this island an infernally rum place, I\r\npromise you. I’d watch my goings carefully, if I were you. _He_—” He\r\nhesitated, and seemed to alter his mind about what was on his lips. “I\r\nwish you’d help me with these rabbits,” he said.\r\n\r\nHis procedure with the rabbits was singular. I waded in with him, and\r\nhelped him lug one of the hutches ashore. No sooner was that done than\r\nhe opened the door of it, and tilting the thing on one end turned its\r\nliving contents out on the ground. They fell in a struggling heap one\r\non the top of the other. He clapped his hands, and forthwith they went\r\noff with that hopping run of theirs, fifteen or twenty of them I should\r\nthink, up the beach.\r\n\r\n“Increase and multiply, my friends,” said Montgomery. “Replenish the\r\nisland. Hitherto we’ve had a certain lack of meat here.”\r\n\r\nAs I watched them disappearing, the white-haired man returned with a\r\nbrandy-flask and some biscuits. “Something to go on with, Prendick,”\r\nsaid he, in a far more familiar tone than before. I made no ado, but\r\nset to work on the biscuits at once, while the white-haired man helped\r\nMontgomery to release about a score more of the rabbits. Three big\r\nhutches, however, went up to the house with the puma. The brandy I did\r\nnot touch, for I have been an abstainer from my birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nTHE LOCKED DOOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will perhaps understand that at first everything was so\r\nstrange about me, and my position was the outcome of such unexpected\r\nadventures, that I had no discernment of the relative strangeness of\r\nthis or that thing. I followed the llama up the beach, and was\r\novertaken by Montgomery, who asked me not to enter the stone enclosure.\r\nI noticed then that the puma in its cage and the pile of packages had\r\nbeen placed outside the entrance to this quadrangle.\r\n\r\nI turned and saw that the launch had now been unloaded, run out again,\r\nand was being beached, and the white-haired man was walking towards us.\r\nHe addressed Montgomery.\r\n\r\n“And now comes the problem of this uninvited guest. What are we to do\r\nwith him?”\r\n\r\n“He knows something of science,” said Montgomery.\r\n\r\n“I’m itching to get to work again—with this new stuff,” said the\r\nwhite-haired man, nodding towards the enclosure. His eyes grew\r\nbrighter.\r\n\r\n“I daresay you are,” said Montgomery, in anything but a cordial tone.\r\n\r\n“We can’t send him over there, and we can’t spare the time to build him\r\na new shanty; and we certainly can’t take him into our confidence just\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\n“I’m in your hands,” said I. I had no idea of what he meant by “over\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been thinking of the same things,” Montgomery answered. “There’s\r\nmy room with the outer door—”\r\n\r\n“That’s it,” said the elder man, promptly, looking at Montgomery; and\r\nall three of us went towards the enclosure. “I’m sorry to make a\r\nmystery, Mr. Prendick; but you’ll remember you’re uninvited. Our little\r\nestablishment here contains a secret or so, is a kind of Blue-Beard’s\r\nchamber, in fact. Nothing very dreadful, really, to a sane man; but\r\njust now, as we don’t know you—”\r\n\r\n“Decidedly,” said I, “I should be a fool to take offence at any want of\r\nconfidence.”\r\n\r\nHe twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smile—he was one of those\r\nsaturnine people who smile with the corners of the mouth down,—and\r\nbowed his acknowledgment of my complaisance. The main entrance to the\r\nenclosure was passed; it was a heavy wooden gate, framed in iron and\r\nlocked, with the cargo of the launch piled outside it, and at the\r\ncorner we came to a small doorway I had not previously observed. The\r\nwhite-haired man produced a bundle of keys from the pocket of his\r\ngreasy blue jacket, opened this door, and entered. His keys, and the\r\nelaborate locking-up of the place even while it was still under his\r\neye, struck me as peculiar. I followed him, and found myself in a small\r\napartment, plainly but not uncomfortably furnished and with its inner\r\ndoor, which was slightly ajar, opening into a paved courtyard. This\r\ninner door Montgomery at once closed. A hammock was slung across the\r\ndarker corner of the room, and a small unglazed window defended by an\r\niron bar looked out towards the sea.\r\n\r\nThis the white-haired man told me was to be my apartment; and the inner\r\ndoor, which “for fear of accidents,” he said, he would lock on the\r\nother side, was my limit inward. He called my attention to a convenient\r\ndeck-chair before the window, and to an array of old books, chiefly, I\r\nfound, surgical works and editions of the Latin and Greek classics\r\n(languages I cannot read with any comfort), on a shelf near the\r\nhammock. He left the room by the outer door, as if to avoid opening the\r\ninner one again.\r\n\r\n“We usually have our meals in here,” said Montgomery, and then, as if\r\nin doubt, went out after the other. “Moreau!” I heard him call, and for\r\nthe moment I do not think I noticed. Then as I handled the books on the\r\nshelf it came up in consciousness: Where had I heard the name of Moreau\r\nbefore? I sat down before the window, took out the biscuits that still\r\nremained to me, and ate them with an excellent appetite. Moreau!\r\n\r\nThrough the window I saw one of those unaccountable men in white,\r\nlugging a packing-case along the beach. Presently the window-frame hid\r\nhim. Then I heard a key inserted and turned in the lock behind me.\r\nAfter a little while I heard through the locked door the noise of the\r\nstaghounds, that had now been brought up from the beach. They were not\r\nbarking, but sniffing and growling in a curious fashion. I could hear\r\nthe rapid patter of their feet, and Montgomery’s voice soothing them.\r\n\r\nI was very much impressed by the elaborate secrecy of these two men\r\nregarding the contents of the place, and for some time I was thinking\r\nof that and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name of Moreau; but\r\nso odd is the human memory that I could not then recall that well-known\r\nname in its proper connection. From that my thoughts went to the\r\nindefinable queerness of the deformed man on the beach. I never saw\r\nsuch a gait, such odd motions as he pulled at the box. I recalled that\r\nnone of these men had spoken to me, though most of them I had found\r\nlooking at me at one time or another in a peculiarly furtive manner,\r\nquite unlike the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage. Indeed,\r\nthey had all seemed remarkably taciturn, and when they did speak,\r\nendowed with very uncanny voices. What was wrong with them? Then I\r\nrecalled the eyes of Montgomery’s ungainly attendant.\r\n\r\nJust as I was thinking of him he came in. He was now dressed in white,\r\nand carried a little tray with some coffee and boiled vegetables\r\nthereon. I could hardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came, bending\r\namiably, and placed the tray before me on the table. Then astonishment\r\nparalysed me. Under his stringy black locks I saw his ear; it jumped\r\nupon me suddenly close to my face. The man had pointed ears, covered\r\nwith a fine brown fur!\r\n\r\n“Your breakfast, sair,” he said.\r\n\r\nI stared at his face without attempting to answer him. He turned and\r\nwent towards the door, regarding me oddly over his shoulder. I followed\r\nhim out with my eyes; and as I did so, by some odd trick of unconscious\r\ncerebration, there came surging into my head the phrase, “The Moreau\r\nHollows”—was it? “The Moreau—” Ah! It sent my memory back ten years.\r\n“The Moreau Horrors!” The phrase drifted loose in my mind for a moment,\r\nand then I saw it in red lettering on a little buff-coloured pamphlet,\r\nto read which made one shiver and creep. Then I remembered distinctly\r\nall about it. That long-forgotten pamphlet came back with startling\r\nvividness to my mind. I had been a mere lad then, and Moreau was, I\r\nsuppose, about fifty,—a prominent and masterful physiologist,\r\nwell-known in scientific circles for his extraordinary imagination and\r\nhis brutal directness in discussion.\r\n\r\nWas this the same Moreau? He had published some very astonishing facts\r\nin connection with the transfusion of blood, and in addition was known\r\nto be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then suddenly his career\r\nwas closed. He had to leave England. A journalist obtained access to\r\nhis laboratory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant, with the\r\ndeliberate intention of making sensational exposures; and by the help\r\nof a shocking accident (if it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet\r\nbecame notorious. On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed\r\nand otherwise mutilated, escaped from Moreau’s house. It was in the\r\nsilly season, and a prominent editor, a cousin of the temporary\r\nlaboratory-assistant, appealed to the conscience of the nation. It was\r\nnot the first time that conscience has turned against the methods of\r\nresearch. The doctor was simply howled out of the country. It may be\r\nthat he deserved to be; but I still think that the tepid support of his\r\nfellow-investigators and his desertion by the great body of scientific\r\nworkers was a shameful thing. Yet some of his experiments, by the\r\njournalist’s account, were wantonly cruel. He might perhaps have\r\npurchased his social peace by abandoning his investigations; but he\r\napparently preferred the latter, as most men would who have once fallen\r\nunder the overmastering spell of research. He was unmarried, and had\r\nindeed nothing but his own interest to consider.\r\n\r\nI felt convinced that this must be the same man. Everything pointed to\r\nit. It dawned upon me to what end the puma and the other animals—which\r\nhad now been brought with other luggage into the enclosure behind the\r\nhouse—were destined; and a curious faint odour, the halitus of\r\nsomething familiar, an odour that had been in the background of my\r\nconsciousness hitherto, suddenly came forward into the forefront of my\r\nthoughts. It was the antiseptic odour of the dissecting-room. I heard\r\nthe puma growling through the wall, and one of the dogs yelped as\r\nthough it had been struck.\r\n\r\nYet surely, and especially to another scientific man, there was nothing\r\nso horrible in vivisection as to account for this secrecy; and by some\r\nodd leap in my thoughts the pointed ears and luminous eyes of\r\nMontgomery’s attendant came back again before me with the sharpest\r\ndefinition. I stared before me out at the green sea, frothing under a\r\nfreshening breeze, and let these and other strange memories of the last\r\nfew days chase one another through my mind.\r\n\r\nWhat could it all mean? A locked enclosure on a lonely island, a\r\nnotorious vivisector, and these crippled and distorted men?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nTHE CRYING OF THE PUMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMontgomery interrupted my tangle of mystification and suspicion about\r\none o’clock, and his grotesque attendant followed him with a tray\r\nbearing bread, some herbs and other eatables, a flask of whiskey, a jug\r\nof water, and three glasses and knives. I glanced askance at this\r\nstrange creature, and found him watching me with his queer, restless\r\neyes. Montgomery said he would lunch with me, but that Moreau was too\r\npreoccupied with some work to come.\r\n\r\n“Moreau!” said I. “I know that name.”\r\n\r\n“The devil you do!” said he. “What an ass I was to mention it to you! I\r\nmight have thought. Anyhow, it will give you an inkling of\r\nour—mysteries. Whiskey?”\r\n\r\n“No, thanks; I’m an abstainer.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I’d been. But it’s no use locking the door after the steed is\r\nstolen. It was that infernal stuff which led to my coming here,—that,\r\nand a foggy night. I thought myself in luck at the time, when Moreau\r\noffered to get me off. It’s queer—”\r\n\r\n“Montgomery,” said I, suddenly, as the outer door closed, “why has your\r\nman pointed ears?”\r\n\r\n“Damn!” he said, over his first mouthful of food. He stared at me for a\r\nmoment, and then repeated, “Pointed ears?”\r\n\r\n“Little points to them,” said I, as calmly as possible, with a catch in\r\nmy breath; “and a fine black fur at the edges?”\r\n\r\nHe helped himself to whiskey and water with great deliberation. “I was\r\nunder the impression—that his hair covered his ears.”\r\n\r\n“I saw them as he stooped by me to put that coffee you sent to me on\r\nthe table. And his eyes shine in the dark.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Montgomery had recovered from the surprise of my question.\r\n“I always thought,” he said deliberately, with a certain accentuation\r\nof his flavouring of lisp, “that there _was_ something the matter with\r\nhis ears, from the way he covered them. What were they like?”\r\n\r\nI was persuaded from his manner that this ignorance was a pretence.\r\nStill, I could hardly tell the man that I thought him a liar.\r\n“Pointed,” I said; “rather small and furry,—distinctly furry. But the\r\nwhole man is one of the strangest beings I ever set eyes on.”\r\n\r\nA sharp, hoarse cry of animal pain came from the enclosure behind us.\r\nIts depth and volume testified to the puma. I saw Montgomery wince.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Where did you pick up the creature?”\r\n\r\n“San Francisco. He’s an ugly brute, I admit. Half-witted, you know.\r\nCan’t remember where he came from. But I’m used to him, you know. We\r\nboth are. How does he strike you?”\r\n\r\n“He’s unnatural,” I said. “There’s something about him—don’t think me\r\nfanciful, but it gives me a nasty little sensation, a tightening of my\r\nmuscles, when he comes near me. It’s a touch—of the diabolical, in\r\nfact.”\r\n\r\nMontgomery had stopped eating while I told him this. “Rum!” he said.\r\n“_I_ can’t see it.” He resumed his meal. “I had no idea of it,” he\r\nsaid, and masticated. “The crew of the schooner must have felt it the\r\nsame. Made a dead set at the poor devil. You saw the captain?”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the puma howled again, this time more painfully. Montgomery\r\nswore under his breath. I had half a mind to attack him about the men\r\non the beach. Then the poor brute within gave vent to a series of\r\nshort, sharp cries.\r\n\r\n“Your men on the beach,” said I; “what race are they?”\r\n\r\n“Excellent fellows, aren’t they?” said he, absentmindedly, knitting his\r\nbrows as the animal yelled out sharply.\r\n\r\nI said no more. There was another outcry worse than the former. He\r\nlooked at me with his dull grey eyes, and then took some more whiskey.\r\nHe tried to draw me into a discussion about alcohol, professing to have\r\nsaved my life with it. He seemed anxious to lay stress on the fact that\r\nI owed my life to him. I answered him distractedly.\r\n\r\nPresently our meal came to an end; the misshapen monster with the\r\npointed ears cleared the remains away, and Montgomery left me alone in\r\nthe room again. All the time he had been in a state of ill-concealed\r\nirritation at the noise of the vivisected puma. He had spoken of his\r\nodd want of nerve, and left me to the obvious application.\r\n\r\nI found myself that the cries were singularly irritating, and they grew\r\nin depth and intensity as the afternoon wore on. They were painful at\r\nfirst, but their constant resurgence at last altogether upset my\r\nbalance. I flung aside a crib of Horace I had been reading, and began\r\nto clench my fists, to bite my lips, and to pace the room. Presently I\r\ngot to stopping my ears with my fingers.\r\n\r\nThe emotional appeal of those yells grew upon me steadily, grew at last\r\nto such an exquisite expression of suffering that I could stand it in\r\nthat confined room no longer. I stepped out of the door into the\r\nslumberous heat of the late afternoon, and walking past the main\r\nentrance—locked again, I noticed—turned the corner of the wall.\r\n\r\nThe crying sounded even louder out of doors. It was as if all the pain\r\nin the world had found a voice. Yet had I known such pain was in the\r\nnext room, and had it been dumb, I believe—I have thought since—I could\r\nhave stood it well enough. It is when suffering finds a voice and sets\r\nour nerves quivering that this pity comes troubling us. But in spite of\r\nthe brilliant sunlight and the green fans of the trees waving in the\r\nsoothing sea-breeze, the world was a confusion, blurred with drifting\r\nblack and red phantasms, until I was out of earshot of the house in the\r\nchequered wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nTHE THING IN THE FOREST.\r\n\r\n\r\nI strode through the undergrowth that clothed the ridge behind the\r\nhouse, scarcely heeding whither I went; passed on through the shadow of\r\na thick cluster of straight-stemmed trees beyond it, and so presently\r\nfound myself some way on the other side of the ridge, and descending\r\ntowards a streamlet that ran through a narrow valley. I paused and\r\nlistened. The distance I had come, or the intervening masses of\r\nthicket, deadened any sound that might be coming from the enclosure.\r\nThe air was still. Then with a rustle a rabbit emerged, and went\r\nscampering up the slope before me. I hesitated, and sat down in the\r\nedge of the shade.\r\n\r\nThe place was a pleasant one. The rivulet was hidden by the luxuriant\r\nvegetation of the banks save at one point, where I caught a triangular\r\npatch of its glittering water. On the farther side I saw through a\r\nbluish haze a tangle of trees and creepers, and above these again the\r\nluminous blue of the sky. Here and there a splash of white or crimson\r\nmarked the blooming of some trailing epiphyte. I let my eyes wander\r\nover this scene for a while, and then began to turn over in my mind\r\nagain the strange peculiarities of Montgomery’s man. But it was too hot\r\nto think elaborately, and presently I fell into a tranquil state midway\r\nbetween dozing and waking.\r\n\r\nFrom this I was aroused, after I know not how long, by a rustling\r\namidst the greenery on the other side of the stream. For a moment I\r\ncould see nothing but the waving summits of the ferns and reeds. Then\r\nsuddenly upon the bank of the stream appeared something—at first I\r\ncould not distinguish what it was. It bowed its round head to the\r\nwater, and began to drink. Then I saw it was a man, going on all-fours\r\nlike a beast. He was clothed in bluish cloth, and was of a\r\ncopper-coloured hue, with black hair. It seemed that grotesque ugliness\r\nwas an invariable character of these islanders. I could hear the suck\r\nof the water at his lips as he drank.\r\n\r\nI leant forward to see him better, and a piece of lava, detached by my\r\nhand, went pattering down the slope. He looked up guiltily, and his\r\neyes met mine. Forthwith he scrambled to his feet, and stood wiping his\r\nclumsy hand across his mouth and regarding me. His legs were scarcely\r\nhalf the length of his body. So, staring one another out of\r\ncountenance, we remained for perhaps the space of a minute. Then,\r\nstopping to look back once or twice, he slunk off among the bushes to\r\nthe right of me, and I heard the swish of the fronds grow faint in the\r\ndistance and die away. Long after he had disappeared, I remained\r\nsitting up staring in the direction of his retreat. My drowsy\r\ntranquillity had gone.\r\n\r\nI was startled by a noise behind me, and turning suddenly saw the\r\nflapping white tail of a rabbit vanishing up the slope. I jumped to my\r\nfeet. The apparition of this grotesque, half-bestial creature had\r\nsuddenly populated the stillness of the afternoon for me. I looked\r\naround me rather nervously, and regretted that I was unarmed. Then I\r\nthought that the man I had just seen had been clothed in bluish cloth,\r\nhad not been naked as a savage would have been; and I tried to persuade\r\nmyself from that fact that he was after all probably a peaceful\r\ncharacter, that the dull ferocity of his countenance belied him.\r\n\r\nYet I was greatly disturbed at the apparition. I walked to the left\r\nalong the slope, turning my head about and peering this way and that\r\namong the straight stems of the trees. Why should a man go on all-fours\r\nand drink with his lips? Presently I heard an animal wailing again, and\r\ntaking it to be the puma, I turned about and walked in a direction\r\ndiametrically opposite to the sound. This led me down to the stream,\r\nacross which I stepped and pushed my way up through the undergrowth\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nI was startled by a great patch of vivid scarlet on the ground, and\r\ngoing up to it found it to be a peculiar fungus, branched and\r\ncorrugated like a foliaceous lichen, but deliquescing into slime at the\r\ntouch; and then in the shadow of some luxuriant ferns I came upon an\r\nunpleasant thing,—the dead body of a rabbit covered with shining flies,\r\nbut still warm and with the head torn off. I stopped aghast at the\r\nsight of the scattered blood. Here at least was one visitor to the\r\nisland disposed of! There were no traces of other violence about it. It\r\nlooked as though it had been suddenly snatched up and killed; and as I\r\nstared at the little furry body came the difficulty of how the thing\r\nhad been done. The vague dread that had been in my mind since I had\r\nseen the inhuman face of the man at the stream grew distincter as I\r\nstood there. I began to realise the hardihood of my expedition among\r\nthese unknown people. The thicket about me became altered to my\r\nimagination. Every shadow became something more than a shadow,—became\r\nan ambush; every rustle became a threat. Invisible things seemed\r\nwatching me. I resolved to go back to the enclosure on the beach. I\r\nsuddenly turned away and thrust myself violently, possibly even\r\nfrantically, through the bushes, anxious to get a clear space about me\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI stopped just in time to prevent myself emerging upon an open space.\r\nIt was a kind of glade in the forest, made by a fall; seedlings were\r\nalready starting up to struggle for the vacant space; and beyond, the\r\ndense growth of stems and twining vines and splashes of fungus and\r\nflowers closed in again. Before me, squatting together upon the fungoid\r\nruins of a huge fallen tree and still unaware of my approach, were\r\nthree grotesque human figures. One was evidently a female; the other\r\ntwo were men. They were naked, save for swathings of scarlet cloth\r\nabout the middle; and their skins were of a dull pinkish-drab colour,\r\nsuch as I had seen in no savages before. They had fat, heavy, chinless\r\nfaces, retreating foreheads, and a scant bristly hair upon their heads.\r\nI never saw such bestial-looking creatures.\r\n\r\nThey were talking, or at least one of the men was talking to the other\r\ntwo, and all three had been too closely interested to heed the rustling\r\nof my approach. They swayed their heads and shoulders from side to\r\nside. The speaker’s words came thick and sloppy, and though I could\r\nhear them distinctly I could not distinguish what he said. He seemed to\r\nme to be reciting some complicated gibberish. Presently his\r\narticulation became shriller, and spreading his hands he rose to his\r\nfeet. At that the others began to gibber in unison, also rising to\r\ntheir feet, spreading their hands and swaying their bodies in rhythm\r\nwith their chant. I noticed then the abnormal shortness of their legs,\r\nand their lank, clumsy feet. All three began slowly to circle round,\r\nraising and stamping their feet and waving their arms; a kind of tune\r\ncrept into their rhythmic recitation, and a refrain,—“Aloola,” or\r\n“Balloola,” it sounded like. Their eyes began to sparkle, and their\r\nugly faces to brighten, with an expression of strange pleasure. Saliva\r\ndripped from their lipless mouths.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as I watched their grotesque and unaccountable gestures, I\r\nperceived clearly for the first time what it was that had offended me,\r\nwhat had given me the two inconsistent and conflicting impressions of\r\nutter strangeness and yet of the strangest familiarity. The three\r\ncreatures engaged in this mysterious rite were human in shape, and yet\r\nhuman beings with the strangest air about them of some familiar animal.\r\nEach of these creatures, despite its human form, its rag of clothing,\r\nand the rough humanity of its bodily form, had woven into it—into its\r\nmovements, into the expression of its countenance, into its whole\r\npresence—some now irresistible suggestion of a hog, a swinish taint,\r\nthe unmistakable mark of the beast.\r\n\r\nI stood overcome by this amazing realisation and then the most horrible\r\nquestionings came rushing into my mind. They began leaping in the air,\r\nfirst one and then the other, whooping and grunting. Then one slipped,\r\nand for a moment was on all-fours,—to recover, indeed, forthwith. But\r\nthat transitory gleam of the true animalism of these monsters was\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nI turned as noiselessly as possible, and becoming every now and then\r\nrigid with the fear of being discovered, as a branch cracked or a leaf\r\nrustled, I pushed back into the bushes. It was long before I grew\r\nbolder, and dared to move freely. My only idea for the moment was to\r\nget away from these foul beings, and I scarcely noticed that I had\r\nemerged upon a faint pathway amidst the trees. Then suddenly traversing\r\na little glade, I saw with an unpleasant start two clumsy legs among\r\nthe trees, walking with noiseless footsteps parallel with my course,\r\nand perhaps thirty yards away from me. The head and upper part of the\r\nbody were hidden by a tangle of creeper. I stopped abruptly, hoping the\r\ncreature did not see me. The feet stopped as I did. So nervous was I\r\nthat I controlled an impulse to headlong flight with the utmost\r\ndifficulty. Then looking hard, I distinguished through the interlacing\r\nnetwork the head and body of the brute I had seen drinking. He moved\r\nhis head. There was an emerald flash in his eyes as he glanced at me\r\nfrom the shadow of the trees, a half-luminous colour that vanished as\r\nhe turned his head again. He was motionless for a moment, and then with\r\na noiseless tread began running through the green confusion. In another\r\nmoment he had vanished behind some bushes. I could not see him, but I\r\nfelt that he had stopped and was watching me again.\r\n\r\nWhat on earth was he,—man or beast? What did he want with me? I had no\r\nweapon, not even a stick. Flight would be madness. At any rate the\r\nThing, whatever it was, lacked the courage to attack me. Setting my\r\nteeth hard, I walked straight towards him. I was anxious not to show\r\nthe fear that seemed chilling my backbone. I pushed through a tangle of\r\ntall white-flowered bushes, and saw him twenty paces beyond, looking\r\nover his shoulder at me and hesitating. I advanced a step or two,\r\nlooking steadfastly into his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” said I.\r\n\r\nHe tried to meet my gaze. “No!” he said suddenly, and turning went\r\nbounding away from me through the undergrowth. Then he turned and\r\nstared at me again. His eyes shone brightly out of the dusk under the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nMy heart was in my mouth; but I felt my only chance was bluff, and\r\nwalked steadily towards him. He turned again, and vanished into the\r\ndusk. Once more I thought I caught the glint of his eyes, and that was\r\nall.\r\n\r\nFor the first time I realised how the lateness of the hour might affect\r\nme. The sun had set some minutes since, the swift dusk of the tropics\r\nwas already fading out of the eastern sky, and a pioneer moth fluttered\r\nsilently by my head. Unless I would spend the night among the unknown\r\ndangers of the mysterious forest, I must hasten back to the enclosure.\r\nThe thought of a return to that pain-haunted refuge was extremely\r\ndisagreeable, but still more so was the idea of being overtaken in the\r\nopen by darkness and all that darkness might conceal. I gave one more\r\nlook into the blue shadows that had swallowed up this odd creature, and\r\nthen retraced my way down the slope towards the stream, going as I\r\njudged in the direction from which I had come.\r\n\r\nI walked eagerly, my mind confused with many things, and presently\r\nfound myself in a level place among scattered trees. The colourless\r\nclearness that comes after the sunset flush was darkling; the blue sky\r\nabove grew momentarily deeper, and the little stars one by one pierced\r\nthe attenuated light; the interspaces of the trees, the gaps in the\r\nfurther vegetation, that had been hazy blue in the daylight, grew black\r\nand mysterious. I pushed on. The colour vanished from the world. The\r\ntree-tops rose against the luminous blue sky in inky silhouette, and\r\nall below that outline melted into one formless blackness. Presently\r\nthe trees grew thinner, and the shrubby undergrowth more abundant. Then\r\nthere was a desolate space covered with a white sand, and then another\r\nexpanse of tangled bushes. I did not remember crossing the sand-opening\r\nbefore. I began to be tormented by a faint rustling upon my right hand.\r\nI thought at first it was fancy, for whenever I stopped there was\r\nsilence, save for the evening breeze in the tree-tops. Then when I\r\nturned to hurry on again there was an echo to my footsteps.\r\n\r\nI turned away from the thickets, keeping to the more open ground, and\r\nendeavouring by sudden turns now and then to surprise something in the\r\nact of creeping upon me. I saw nothing, and nevertheless my sense of\r\nanother presence grew steadily. I increased my pace, and after some\r\ntime came to a slight ridge, crossed it, and turned sharply, regarding\r\nit steadfastly from the further side. It came out black and clear-cut\r\nagainst the darkling sky; and presently a shapeless lump heaved up\r\nmomentarily against the sky-line and vanished again. I felt assured now\r\nthat my tawny-faced antagonist was stalking me once more; and coupled\r\nwith that was another unpleasant realisation, that I had lost my way.\r\n\r\nFor a time I hurried on hopelessly perplexed, and pursued by that\r\nstealthy approach. Whatever it was, the Thing either lacked the courage\r\nto attack me, or it was waiting to take me at some disadvantage. I kept\r\nstudiously to the open. At times I would turn and listen; and presently\r\nI had half persuaded myself that my pursuer had abandoned the chase, or\r\nwas a mere creation of my disordered imagination. Then I heard the\r\nsound of the sea. I quickened my footsteps almost into a run, and\r\nimmediately there was a stumble in my rear.\r\n\r\nI turned suddenly, and stared at the uncertain trees behind me. One\r\nblack shadow seemed to leap into another. I listened, rigid, and heard\r\nnothing but the creep of the blood in my ears. I thought that my nerves\r\nwere unstrung, and that my imagination was tricking me, and turned\r\nresolutely towards the sound of the sea again.\r\n\r\nIn a minute or so the trees grew thinner, and I emerged upon a bare,\r\nlow headland running out into the sombre water. The night was calm and\r\nclear, and the reflection of the growing multitude of the stars\r\nshivered in the tranquil heaving of the sea. Some way out, the wash\r\nupon an irregular band of reef shone with a pallid light of its own.\r\nWestward I saw the zodiacal light mingling with the yellow brilliance\r\nof the evening star. The coast fell away from me to the east, and\r\nwestward it was hidden by the shoulder of the cape. Then I recalled the\r\nfact that Moreau’s beach lay to the west.\r\n\r\nA twig snapped behind me, and there was a rustle. I turned, and stood\r\nfacing the dark trees. I could see nothing—or else I could see too\r\nmuch. Every dark form in the dimness had its ominous quality, its\r\npeculiar suggestion of alert watchfulness. So I stood for perhaps a\r\nminute, and then, with an eye to the trees still, turned westward to\r\ncross the headland; and as I moved, one among the lurking shadows moved\r\nto follow me.\r\n\r\nMy heart beat quickly. Presently the broad sweep of a bay to the\r\nwestward became visible, and I halted again. The noiseless shadow\r\nhalted a dozen yards from me. A little point of light shone on the\r\nfurther bend of the curve, and the grey sweep of the sandy beach lay\r\nfaint under the starlight. Perhaps two miles away was that little point\r\nof light. To get to the beach I should have to go through the trees\r\nwhere the shadows lurked, and down a bushy slope.\r\n\r\nI could see the Thing rather more distinctly now. It was no animal, for\r\nit stood erect. At that I opened my mouth to speak, and found a hoarse\r\nphlegm choked my voice. I tried again, and shouted, “Who is there?”\r\nThere was no answer. I advanced a step. The Thing did not move, only\r\ngathered itself together. My foot struck a stone. That gave me an idea.\r\nWithout taking my eyes off the black form before me, I stooped and\r\npicked up this lump of rock; but at my motion the Thing turned abruptly\r\nas a dog might have done, and slunk obliquely into the further\r\ndarkness. Then I recalled a schoolboy expedient against big dogs, and\r\ntwisted the rock into my handkerchief, and gave this a turn round my\r\nwrist. I heard a movement further off among the shadows, as if the\r\nThing was in retreat. Then suddenly my tense excitement gave way; I\r\nbroke into a profuse perspiration and fell a-trembling, with my\r\nadversary routed and this weapon in my hand.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before I could summon resolution to go down through\r\nthe trees and bushes upon the flank of the headland to the beach. At\r\nlast I did it at a run; and as I emerged from the thicket upon the\r\nsand, I heard some other body come crashing after me. At that I\r\ncompletely lost my head with fear, and began running along the sand.\r\nForthwith there came the swift patter of soft feet in pursuit. I gave a\r\nwild cry, and redoubled my pace. Some dim, black things about three or\r\nfour times the size of rabbits went running or hopping up from the\r\nbeach towards the bushes as I passed.\r\n\r\nSo long as I live, I shall remember the terror of that chase. I ran\r\nnear the water’s edge, and heard every now and then the splash of the\r\nfeet that gained upon me. Far away, hopelessly far, was the yellow\r\nlight. All the night about us was black and still. Splash, splash, came\r\nthe pursuing feet, nearer and nearer. I felt my breath going, for I was\r\nquite out of training; it whooped as I drew it, and I felt a pain like\r\na knife at my side. I perceived the Thing would come up with me long\r\nbefore I reached the enclosure, and, desperate and sobbing for my\r\nbreath, I wheeled round upon it and struck at it as it came up to\r\nme,—struck with all my strength. The stone came out of the sling of the\r\nhandkerchief as I did so. As I turned, the Thing, which had been\r\nrunning on all-fours, rose to its feet, and the missile fell fair on\r\nits left temple. The skull rang loud, and the animal-man blundered into\r\nme, thrust me back with its hands, and went staggering past me to fall\r\nheadlong upon the sand with its face in the water; and there it lay\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nI could not bring myself to approach that black heap. I left it there,\r\nwith the water rippling round it, under the still stars, and giving it\r\na wide berth pursued my way towards the yellow glow of the house; and\r\npresently, with a positive effect of relief, came the pitiful moaning\r\nof the puma, the sound that had originally driven me out to explore\r\nthis mysterious island. At that, though I was faint and horribly\r\nfatigued, I gathered together all my strength, and began running again\r\ntowards the light. I thought I heard a voice calling me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\nTHE CRYING OF THE MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I drew near the house I saw that the light shone from the open door\r\nof my room; and then I heard coming from out of the darkness at the\r\nside of that orange oblong of light, the voice of Montgomery shouting,\r\n“Prendick!” I continued running. Presently I heard him again. I replied\r\nby a feeble “Hullo!” and in another moment had staggered up to him.\r\n\r\n“Where have you been?” said he, holding me at arm’s length, so that the\r\nlight from the door fell on my face. “We have both been so busy that we\r\nforgot you until about half an hour ago.” He led me into the room and\r\nsat me down in the deck chair. For awhile I was blinded by the light.\r\n“We did not think you would start to explore this island of ours\r\nwithout telling us,” he said; and then, “I was afraid—But—what—Hullo!”\r\n\r\nMy last remaining strength slipped from me, and my head fell forward on\r\nmy chest. I think he found a certain satisfaction in giving me brandy.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake,” said I, “fasten that door.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve been meeting some of our curiosities, eh?” said he.\r\n\r\nHe locked the door and turned to me again. He asked me no questions,\r\nbut gave me some more brandy and water and pressed me to eat. I was in\r\na state of collapse. He said something vague about his forgetting to\r\nwarn me, and asked me briefly when I left the house and what I had\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nI answered him as briefly, in fragmentary sentences. “Tell me what it\r\nall means,” said I, in a state bordering on hysterics.\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing so very dreadful,” said he. “But I think you have had\r\nabout enough for one day.” The puma suddenly gave a sharp yell of pain.\r\nAt that he swore under his breath. “I’m damned,” said he, “if this\r\nplace is not as bad as Gower Street, with its cats.”\r\n\r\n“Montgomery,” said I, “what was that thing that came after me? Was it a\r\nbeast or was it a man?”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t sleep to-night,” he said, “you’ll be off your head\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\nI stood up in front of him. “What was that thing that came after me?” I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nHe looked me squarely in the eyes, and twisted his mouth askew. His\r\neyes, which had seemed animated a minute before, went dull. “From your\r\naccount,” said he, “I’m thinking it was a bogle.”\r\n\r\nI felt a gust of intense irritation, which passed as quickly as it\r\ncame. I flung myself into the chair again, and pressed my hands on my\r\nforehead. The puma began once more.\r\n\r\nMontgomery came round behind me and put his hand on my shoulder. “Look\r\nhere, Prendick,” he said, “I had no business to let you drift out into\r\nthis silly island of ours. But it’s not so bad as you feel, man. Your\r\nnerves are worked to rags. Let me give you something that will make you\r\nsleep. _That_—will keep on for hours yet. You must simply get to sleep,\r\nor I won’t answer for it.”\r\n\r\nI did not reply. I bowed forward, and covered my face with my hands.\r\nPresently he returned with a small measure containing a dark liquid.\r\nThis he gave me. I took it unresistingly, and he helped me into the\r\nhammock.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, it was broad day. For a little while I lay flat, staring\r\nat the roof above me. The rafters, I observed, were made out of the\r\ntimbers of a ship. Then I turned my head, and saw a meal prepared for\r\nme on the table. I perceived that I was hungry, and prepared to clamber\r\nout of the hammock, which, very politely anticipating my intention,\r\ntwisted round and deposited me upon all-fours on the floor.\r\n\r\nI got up and sat down before the food. I had a heavy feeling in my\r\nhead, and only the vaguest memory at first of the things that had\r\nhappened over night. The morning breeze blew very pleasantly through\r\nthe unglazed window, and that and the food contributed to the sense of\r\nanimal comfort which I experienced. Presently the door behind me—the\r\ndoor inward towards the yard of the enclosure—opened. I turned and saw\r\nMontgomery’s face.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said he. “I’m frightfully busy.” And he shut the door.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I discovered that he forgot to re-lock it. Then I recalled\r\nthe expression of his face the previous night, and with that the memory\r\nof all I had experienced reconstructed itself before me. Even as that\r\nfear came back to me came a cry from within; but this time it was not\r\nthe cry of a puma. I put down the mouthful that hesitated upon my lips,\r\nand listened. Silence, save for the whisper of the morning breeze. I\r\nbegan to think my ears had deceived me.\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause I resumed my meal, but with my ears still vigilant.\r\nPresently I heard something else, very faint and low. I sat as if\r\nfrozen in my attitude. Though it was faint and low, it moved me more\r\nprofoundly than all that I had hitherto heard of the abominations\r\nbehind the wall. There was no mistake this time in the quality of the\r\ndim, broken sounds; no doubt at all of their source. For it was\r\ngroaning, broken by sobs and gasps of anguish. It was no brute this\r\ntime; it was a human being in torment!\r\n\r\nAs I realised this I rose, and in three steps had crossed the room,\r\nseized the handle of the door into the yard, and flung it open before\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Prendick, man! Stop!” cried Montgomery, intervening.\r\n\r\nA startled deerhound yelped and snarled. There was blood, I saw, in the\r\nsink,—brown, and some scarlet—and I smelt the peculiar smell of\r\ncarbolic acid. Then through an open doorway beyond, in the dim light of\r\nthe shadow, I saw something bound painfully upon a framework, scarred,\r\nred, and bandaged; and then blotting this out appeared the face of old\r\nMoreau, white and terrible. In a moment he had gripped me by the\r\nshoulder with a hand that was smeared red, had twisted me off my feet,\r\nand flung me headlong back into my own room. He lifted me as though I\r\nwas a little child. I fell at full length upon the floor, and the door\r\nslammed and shut out the passionate intensity of his face. Then I heard\r\nthe key turn in the lock, and Montgomery’s voice in expostulation.\r\n\r\n“Ruin the work of a lifetime,” I heard Moreau say.\r\n\r\n“He does not understand,” said Montgomery. and other things that were\r\ninaudible.\r\n\r\n“I can’t spare the time yet,” said Moreau.\r\n\r\nThe rest I did not hear. I picked myself up and stood trembling, my\r\nmind a chaos of the most horrible misgivings. Could it be possible, I\r\nthought, that such a thing as the vivisection of men was carried on\r\nhere? The question shot like lightning across a tumultuous sky; and\r\nsuddenly the clouded horror of my mind condensed into a vivid\r\nrealisation of my own danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\nTHE HUNTING OF THE MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt came before my mind with an unreasonable hope of escape that the\r\nouter door of my room was still open to me. I was convinced now,\r\nabsolutely assured, that Moreau had been vivisecting a human being. All\r\nthe time since I had heard his name, I had been trying to link in my\r\nmind in some way the grotesque animalism of the islanders with his\r\nabominations; and now I thought I saw it all. The memory of his work on\r\nthe transfusion of blood recurred to me. These creatures I had seen\r\nwere the victims of some hideous experiment. These sickening scoundrels\r\nhad merely intended to keep me back, to fool me with their display of\r\nconfidence, and presently to fall upon me with a fate more horrible\r\nthan death,—with torture; and after torture the most hideous\r\ndegradation it is possible to conceive,—to send me off a lost soul, a\r\nbeast, to the rest of their Comus rout.\r\n\r\nI looked round for some weapon. Nothing. Then with an inspiration I\r\nturned over the deck chair, put my foot on the side of it, and tore\r\naway the side rail. It happened that a nail came away with the wood,\r\nand projecting, gave a touch of danger to an otherwise petty weapon. I\r\nheard a step outside, and incontinently flung open the door and found\r\nMontgomery within a yard of it. He meant to lock the outer door! I\r\nraised this nailed stick of mine and cut at his face; but he sprang\r\nback. I hesitated a moment, then turned and fled, round the corner of\r\nthe house. “Prendick, man!” I heard his astonished cry, “don’t be a\r\nsilly ass, man!”\r\n\r\nAnother minute, thought I, and he would have had me locked in, and as\r\nready as a hospital rabbit for my fate. He emerged behind the corner,\r\nfor I heard him shout, “Prendick!” Then he began to run after me,\r\nshouting things as he ran. This time running blindly, I went\r\nnortheastward in a direction at right angles to my previous expedition.\r\nOnce, as I went running headlong up the beach, I glanced over my\r\nshoulder and saw his attendant with him. I ran furiously up the slope,\r\nover it, then turning eastward along a rocky valley fringed on either\r\nside with jungle I ran for perhaps a mile altogether, my chest\r\nstraining, my heart beating in my ears; and then hearing nothing of\r\nMontgomery or his man, and feeling upon the verge of exhaustion, I\r\ndoubled sharply back towards the beach as I judged, and lay down in the\r\nshelter of a canebrake. There I remained for a long time, too fearful\r\nto move, and indeed too fearful even to plan a course of action. The\r\nwild scene about me lay sleeping silently under the sun, and the only\r\nsound near me was the thin hum of some small gnats that had discovered\r\nme. Presently I became aware of a drowsy breathing sound, the soughing\r\nof the sea upon the beach.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour I heard Montgomery shouting my name, far away to\r\nthe north. That set me thinking of my plan of action. As I interpreted\r\nit then, this island was inhabited only by these two vivisectors and\r\ntheir animalised victims. Some of these no doubt they could press into\r\ntheir service against me if need arose. I knew both Moreau and\r\nMontgomery carried revolvers; and, save for a feeble bar of deal spiked\r\nwith a small nail, the merest mockery of a mace, I was unarmed.\r\n\r\nSo I lay still there, until I began to think of food and drink; and at\r\nthat thought the real hopelessness of my position came home to me. I\r\nknew no way of getting anything to eat. I was too ignorant of botany to\r\ndiscover any resort of root or fruit that might lie about me; I had no\r\nmeans of trapping the few rabbits upon the island. It grew blanker the\r\nmore I turned the prospect over. At last in the desperation of my\r\nposition, my mind turned to the animal men I had encountered. I tried\r\nto find some hope in what I remembered of them. In turn I recalled each\r\none I had seen, and tried to draw some augury of assistance from my\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly I heard a staghound bay, and at that realised a new\r\ndanger. I took little time to think, or they would have caught me then,\r\nbut snatching up my nailed stick, rushed headlong from my hiding-place\r\ntowards the sound of the sea. I remember a growth of thorny plants,\r\nwith spines that stabbed like pen-knives. I emerged bleeding and with\r\ntorn clothes upon the lip of a long creek opening northward. I went\r\nstraight into the water without a minute’s hesitation, wading up the\r\ncreek, and presently finding myself kneedeep in a little stream. I\r\nscrambled out at last on the westward bank, and with my heart beating\r\nloudly in my ears, crept into a tangle of ferns to await the issue. I\r\nheard the dog (there was only one) draw nearer, and yelp when it came\r\nto the thorns. Then I heard no more, and presently began to think I had\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed; the silence lengthened out, and at last after an\r\nhour of security my courage began to return to me. By this time I was\r\nno longer very much terrified or very miserable. I had, as it were,\r\npassed the limit of terror and despair. I felt now that my life was\r\npractically lost, and that persuasion made me capable of daring\r\nanything. I had even a certain wish to encounter Moreau face to face;\r\nand as I had waded into the water, I remembered that if I were too hard\r\npressed at least one path of escape from torment still lay open to\r\nme,—they could not very well prevent my drowning myself. I had half a\r\nmind to drown myself then; but an odd wish to see the whole adventure\r\nout, a queer, impersonal, spectacular interest in myself, restrained\r\nme. I stretched my limbs, sore and painful from the pricks of the spiny\r\nplants, and stared around me at the trees; and, so suddenly that it\r\nseemed to jump out of the green tracery about it, my eyes lit upon a\r\nblack face watching me. I saw that it was the simian creature who had\r\nmet the launch upon the beach. He was clinging to the oblique stem of a\r\npalm-tree. I gripped my stick, and stood up facing him. He began\r\nchattering. “You, you, you,” was all I could distinguish at first.\r\nSuddenly he dropped from the tree, and in another moment was holding\r\nthe fronds apart and staring curiously at me.\r\n\r\nI did not feel the same repugnance towards this creature which I had\r\nexperienced in my encounters with the other Beast Men. “You,” he said,\r\n“in the boat.” He was a man, then,—at least as much of a man as\r\nMontgomery’s attendant,—for he could talk.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “I came in the boat. From the ship.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” he said, and his bright, restless eyes travelled over me, to my\r\nhands, to the stick I carried, to my feet, to the tattered places in my\r\ncoat, and the cuts and scratches I had received from the thorns. He\r\nseemed puzzled at something. His eyes came back to my hands. He held\r\nhis own hand out and counted his digits slowly, “One, two, three, four,\r\nfive—eigh?”\r\n\r\nI did not grasp his meaning then; afterwards I was to find that a great\r\nproportion of these Beast People had malformed hands, lacking sometimes\r\neven three digits. But guessing this was in some way a greeting, I did\r\nthe same thing by way of reply. He grinned with immense satisfaction.\r\nThen his swift roving glance went round again; he made a swift\r\nmovement—and vanished. The fern fronds he had stood between came\r\nswishing together.\r\n\r\nI pushed out of the brake after him, and was astonished to find him\r\nswinging cheerfully by one lank arm from a rope of creepers that looped\r\ndown from the foliage overhead. His back was to me.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” said I.\r\n\r\nHe came down with a twisting jump, and stood facing me.\r\n\r\n“I say,” said I, “where can I get something to eat?”\r\n\r\n“Eat!” he said. “Eat Man’s food, now.” And his eye went back to the\r\nswing of ropes. “At the huts.”\r\n\r\n“But where are the huts?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”\r\n\r\n“I’m new, you know.”\r\n\r\nAt that he swung round, and set off at a quick walk. All his motions\r\nwere curiously rapid. “Come along,” said he.\r\n\r\nI went with him to see the adventure out. I guessed the huts were some\r\nrough shelter where he and some more of these Beast People lived. I\r\nmight perhaps find them friendly, find some handle in their minds to\r\ntake hold of. I did not know how far they had forgotten their human\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\nMy ape-like companion trotted along by my side, with his hands hanging\r\ndown and his jaw thrust forward. I wondered what memory he might have\r\nin him. “How long have you been on this island?” said I.\r\n\r\n“How long?” he asked; and after having the question repeated, he held\r\nup three fingers.\r\n\r\nThe creature was little better than an idiot. I tried to make out what\r\nhe meant by that, and it seems I bored him. After another question or\r\ntwo he suddenly left my side and went leaping at some fruit that hung\r\nfrom a tree. He pulled down a handful of prickly husks and went on\r\neating the contents. I noted this with satisfaction, for here at least\r\nwas a hint for feeding. I tried him with some other questions, but his\r\nchattering, prompt responses were as often as not quite at cross\r\npurposes with my question. Some few were appropriate, others quite\r\nparrot-like.\r\n\r\nI was so intent upon these peculiarities that I scarcely noticed the\r\npath we followed. Presently we came to trees, all charred and brown,\r\nand so to a bare place covered with a yellow-white incrustation, across\r\nwhich a drifting smoke, pungent in whiffs to nose and eyes, went\r\ndrifting. On our right, over a shoulder of bare rock, I saw the level\r\nblue of the sea. The path coiled down abruptly into a narrow ravine\r\nbetween two tumbled and knotty masses of blackish scoriae. Into this we\r\nplunged.\r\n\r\nIt was extremely dark, this passage, after the blinding sunlight\r\nreflected from the sulphurous ground. Its walls grew steep, and\r\napproached each other. Blotches of green and crimson drifted across my\r\neyes. My conductor stopped suddenly. “Home!” said he, and I stood in a\r\nfloor of a chasm that was at first absolutely dark to me. I heard some\r\nstrange noises, and thrust the knuckles of my left hand into my eyes. I\r\nbecame aware of a disagreeable odor, like that of a monkey’s cage\r\nill-cleaned. Beyond, the rock opened again upon a gradual slope of\r\nsunlit greenery, and on either hand the light smote down through narrow\r\nways into the central gloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\nTHE SAYERS OF THE LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen something cold touched my hand. I started violently, and saw close\r\nto me a dim pinkish thing, looking more like a flayed child than\r\nanything else in the world. The creature had exactly the mild but\r\nrepulsive features of a sloth, the same low forehead and slow gestures.\r\n\r\nAs the first shock of the change of light passed, I saw about me more\r\ndistinctly. The little sloth-like creature was standing and staring at\r\nme. My conductor had vanished. The place was a narrow passage between\r\nhigh walls of lava, a crack in the knotted rock, and on either side\r\ninterwoven heaps of sea-mat, palm-fans, and reeds leaning against the\r\nrock formed rough and impenetrably dark dens. The winding way up the\r\nravine between these was scarcely three yards wide, and was disfigured\r\nby lumps of decaying fruit-pulp and other refuse, which accounted for\r\nthe disagreeable stench of the place.\r\n\r\nThe little pink sloth-creature was still blinking at me when my Ape-man\r\nreappeared at the aperture of the nearest of these dens, and beckoned\r\nme in. As he did so a slouching monster wriggled out of one of the\r\nplaces, further up this strange street, and stood up in featureless\r\nsilhouette against the bright green beyond, staring at me. I hesitated,\r\nhaving half a mind to bolt the way I had come; and then, determined to\r\ngo through with the adventure, I gripped my nailed stick about the\r\nmiddle and crawled into the little evil-smelling lean-to after my\r\nconductor.\r\n\r\nIt was a semi-circular space, shaped like the half of a bee-hive; and\r\nagainst the rocky wall that formed the inner side of it was a pile of\r\nvariegated fruits, cocoa-nuts among others. Some rough vessels of lava\r\nand wood stood about the floor, and one on a rough stool. There was no\r\nfire. In the darkest corner of the hut sat a shapeless mass of darkness\r\nthat grunted “Hey!” as I came in, and my Ape-man stood in the dim light\r\nof the doorway and held out a split cocoa-nut to me as I crawled into\r\nthe other corner and squatted down. I took it, and began gnawing it, as\r\nserenely as possible, in spite of a certain trepidation and the nearly\r\nintolerable closeness of the den. The little pink sloth-creature stood\r\nin the aperture of the hut, and something else with a drab face and\r\nbright eyes came staring over its shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Hey!” came out of the lump of mystery opposite. “It is a man.”\r\n\r\n“It is a man,” gabbled my conductor, “a man, a man, a five-man, like\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Shut up!” said the voice from the dark, and grunted. I gnawed my\r\ncocoa-nut amid an impressive stillness.\r\n\r\nI peered hard into the blackness, but could distinguish nothing.\r\n\r\n“It is a man,” the voice repeated. “He comes to live with us?”\r\n\r\nIt was a thick voice, with something in it—a kind of whistling\r\novertone—that struck me as peculiar; but the English accent was\r\nstrangely good.\r\n\r\nThe Ape-man looked at me as though he expected something. I perceived\r\nthe pause was interrogative. “He comes to live with you,” I said.\r\n\r\n“It is a man. He must learn the Law.”\r\n\r\nI began to distinguish now a deeper blackness in the black, a vague\r\noutline of a hunched-up figure. Then I noticed the opening of the place\r\nwas darkened by two more black heads. My hand tightened on my stick.\r\n\r\nThe thing in the dark repeated in a louder tone, “Say the words.” I had\r\nmissed its last remark. “Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law,” it\r\nrepeated in a kind of sing-song.\r\n\r\nI was puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Say the words,” said the Ape-man, repeating, and the figures in the\r\ndoorway echoed this, with a threat in the tone of their voices.\r\n\r\nI realised that I had to repeat this idiotic formula; and then began\r\nthe insanest ceremony. The voice in the dark began intoning a mad\r\nlitany, line by line, and I and the rest to repeat it. As they did so,\r\nthey swayed from side to side in the oddest way, and beat their hands\r\nupon their knees; and I followed their example. I could have imagined I\r\nwas already dead and in another world. That dark hut, these grotesque\r\ndim figures, just flecked here and there by a glimmer of light, and all\r\nof them swaying in unison and chanting,\r\n\r\n“Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law. Are we not Men?\r\n“Not to suck up Drink; that is the Law. Are we not Men?\r\n“Not to eat Fish or Flesh; that is the Law. Are we not Men?\r\n“Not to claw the Bark of Trees; _that_ is the Law. Are we not Men?\r\n“Not to chase other Men; _that_ is the Law. Are we not Men?”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so from the prohibition of these acts of folly, on to the\r\nprohibition of what I thought then were the maddest, most impossible,\r\nand most indecent things one could well imagine. A kind of rhythmic\r\nfervour fell on all of us; we gabbled and swayed faster and faster,\r\nrepeating this amazing Law. Superficially the contagion of these brutes\r\nwas upon me, but deep down within me the laughter and disgust struggled\r\ntogether. We ran through a long list of prohibitions, and then the\r\nchant swung round to a new formula.\r\n\r\n“_His_ is the House of Pain.\r\n“_His_ is the Hand that makes.\r\n“_His_ is the Hand that wounds.\r\n“_His_ is the Hand that heals.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so on for another long series, mostly quite incomprehensible\r\ngibberish to me about _Him_, whoever he might be. I could have fancied\r\nit was a dream, but never before have I heard chanting in a dream.\r\n\r\n“_His_ is the lightning flash,” we sang. “_His_ is the deep, salt sea.”\r\n\r\nA horrible fancy came into my head that Moreau, after animalising these\r\nmen, had infected their dwarfed brains with a kind of deification of\r\nhimself. However, I was too keenly aware of white teeth and strong\r\nclaws about me to stop my chanting on that account.\r\n\r\n“_His_ are the stars in the sky.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last that song ended. I saw the Ape-man’s face shining with\r\nperspiration; and my eyes being now accustomed to the darkness, I saw\r\nmore distinctly the figure in the corner from which the voice came. It\r\nwas the size of a man, but it seemed covered with a dull grey hair\r\nalmost like a Skye-terrier. What was it? What were they all? Imagine\r\nyourself surrounded by all the most horrible cripples and maniacs it is\r\npossible to conceive, and you may understand a little of my feelings\r\nwith these grotesque caricatures of humanity about me.\r\n\r\n“He is a five-man, a five-man, a five-man—like me,” said the Ape-man.\r\n\r\nI held out my hands. The grey creature in the corner leant forward.\r\n\r\n“Not to run on all-fours; that is the Law. Are we not Men?” he said.\r\n\r\nHe put out a strangely distorted talon and gripped my fingers. The\r\nthing was almost like the hoof of a deer produced into claws. I could\r\nhave yelled with surprise and pain. His face came forward and peered at\r\nmy nails, came forward into the light of the opening of the hut and I\r\nsaw with a quivering disgust that it was like the face of neither man\r\nnor beast, but a mere shock of grey hair, with three shadowy\r\nover-archings to mark the eyes and mouth.\r\n\r\n“He has little nails,” said this grisly creature in his hairy beard.\r\n“It is well.”\r\n\r\nHe threw my hand down, and instinctively I gripped my stick.\r\n\r\n“Eat roots and herbs; it is His will,” said the Ape-man.\r\n\r\n“I am the Sayer of the Law,” said the grey figure. “Here come all that\r\nbe new to learn the Law. I sit in the darkness and say the Law.”\r\n\r\n“It is even so,” said one of the beasts in the doorway.\r\n\r\n“Evil are the punishments of those who break the Law. None escape.”\r\n\r\n“None escape,” said the Beast Folk, glancing furtively at one another.\r\n\r\n“None, none,” said the Ape-man,—“none escape. See! I did a little\r\nthing, a wrong thing, once. I jabbered, jabbered, stopped talking. None\r\ncould understand. I am burnt, branded in the hand. He is great. He is\r\ngood!”\r\n\r\n“None escape,” said the grey creature in the corner.\r\n\r\n“None escape,” said the Beast People, looking askance at one another.\r\n\r\n“For every one the want that is bad,” said the grey Sayer of the Law.\r\n“What you will want we do not know; we shall know. Some want to follow\r\nthings that move, to watch and slink and wait and spring; to kill and\r\nbite, bite deep and rich, sucking the blood. It is bad. ‘Not to chase\r\nother Men; that is the Law. Are we not Men? Not to eat Flesh or Fish;\r\nthat is the Law. Are we not Men?’”\r\n\r\n“None escape,” said a dappled brute standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\n“For every one the want is bad,” said the grey Sayer of the Law. “Some\r\nwant to go tearing with teeth and hands into the roots of things,\r\nsnuffing into the earth. It is bad.”\r\n\r\n“None escape,” said the men in the door.\r\n\r\n“Some go clawing trees; some go scratching at the graves of the dead;\r\nsome go fighting with foreheads or feet or claws; some bite suddenly,\r\nnone giving occasion; some love uncleanness.”\r\n\r\n“None escape,” said the Ape-man, scratching his calf.\r\n\r\n“None escape,” said the little pink sloth-creature.\r\n\r\n“Punishment is sharp and sure. Therefore learn the Law. Say the words.”\r\n\r\nAnd incontinently he began again the strange litany of the Law, and\r\nagain I and all these creatures began singing and swaying. My head\r\nreeled with this jabbering and the close stench of the place; but I\r\nkept on, trusting to find presently some chance of a new development.\r\n\r\n“Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law. Are we not Men?”\r\n\r\nWe were making such a noise that I noticed nothing of a tumult outside,\r\nuntil some one, who I think was one of the two Swine Men I had seen,\r\nthrust his head over the little pink sloth-creature and shouted\r\nsomething excitedly, something that I did not catch. Incontinently\r\nthose at the opening of the hut vanished; my Ape-man rushed out; the\r\nthing that had sat in the dark followed him (I only observed that it\r\nwas big and clumsy, and covered with silvery hair), and I was left\r\nalone. Then before I reached the aperture I heard the yelp of a\r\nstaghound.\r\n\r\nIn another moment I was standing outside the hovel, my chair-rail in my\r\nhand, every muscle of me quivering. Before me were the clumsy backs of\r\nperhaps a score of these Beast People, their misshapen heads half\r\nhidden by their shoulder-blades. They were gesticulating excitedly.\r\nOther half-animal faces glared interrogation out of the hovels. Looking\r\nin the direction in which they faced, I saw coming through the haze\r\nunder the trees beyond the end of the passage of dens the dark figure\r\nand awful white face of Moreau. He was holding the leaping staghound\r\nback, and close behind him came Montgomery revolver in hand.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I stood horror-struck. I turned and saw the passage behind\r\nme blocked by another heavy brute, with a huge grey face and twinkling\r\nlittle eyes, advancing towards me. I looked round and saw to the right\r\nof me and a half-dozen yards in front of me a narrow gap in the wall of\r\nrock through which a ray of light slanted into the shadows.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” cried Moreau as I strode towards this, and then, “Hold him!”\r\n\r\nAt that, first one face turned towards me and then others. Their\r\nbestial minds were happily slow. I dashed my shoulder into a clumsy\r\nmonster who was turning to see what Moreau meant, and flung him forward\r\ninto another. I felt his hands fly round, clutching at me and missing\r\nme. The little pink sloth-creature dashed at me, and I gashed down its\r\nugly face with the nail in my stick and in another minute was\r\nscrambling up a steep side pathway, a kind of sloping chimney, out of\r\nthe ravine. I heard a howl behind me, and cries of “Catch him!” “Hold\r\nhim!” and the grey-faced creature appeared behind me and jammed his\r\nhuge bulk into the cleft. “Go on! go on!” they howled. I clambered up\r\nthe narrow cleft in the rock and came out upon the sulphur on the\r\nwestward side of the village of the Beast Men.\r\n\r\nThat gap was altogether fortunate for me, for the narrow chimney,\r\nslanting obliquely upward, must have impeded the nearer pursuers. I ran\r\nover the white space and down a steep slope, through a scattered growth\r\nof trees, and came to a low-lying stretch of tall reeds, through which\r\nI pushed into a dark, thick undergrowth that was black and succulent\r\nunder foot. As I plunged into the reeds, my foremost pursuers emerged\r\nfrom the gap. I broke my way through this undergrowth for some minutes.\r\nThe air behind me and about me was soon full of threatening cries. I\r\nheard the tumult of my pursuers in the gap up the slope, then the\r\ncrashing of the reeds, and every now and then the crackling crash of a\r\nbranch. Some of the creatures roared like excited beasts of prey. The\r\nstaghound yelped to the left. I heard Moreau and Montgomery shouting in\r\nthe same direction. I turned sharply to the right. It seemed to me even\r\nthen that I heard Montgomery shouting for me to run for my life.\r\n\r\nPresently the ground gave rich and oozy under my feet; but I was\r\ndesperate and went headlong into it, struggled through kneedeep, and so\r\ncame to a winding path among tall canes. The noise of my pursuers\r\npassed away to my left. In one place three strange, pink, hopping\r\nanimals, about the size of cats, bolted before my footsteps. This\r\npathway ran up hill, across another open space covered with white\r\nincrustation, and plunged into a canebrake again. Then suddenly it\r\nturned parallel with the edge of a steep-walled gap, which came without\r\nwarning, like the ha-ha of an English park,—turned with an unexpected\r\nabruptness. I was still running with all my might, and I never saw this\r\ndrop until I was flying headlong through the air.\r\n\r\nI fell on my forearms and head, among thorns, and rose with a torn ear\r\nand bleeding face. I had fallen into a precipitous ravine, rocky and\r\nthorny, full of a hazy mist which drifted about me in wisps, and with a\r\nnarrow streamlet from which this mist came meandering down the centre.\r\nI was astonished at this thin fog in the full blaze of daylight; but I\r\nhad no time to stand wondering then. I turned to my right, down-stream,\r\nhoping to come to the sea in that direction, and so have my way open to\r\ndrown myself. It was only later I found that I had dropped my nailed\r\nstick in my fall.\r\n\r\nPresently the ravine grew narrower for a space, and carelessly I\r\nstepped into the stream. I jumped out again pretty quickly, for the\r\nwater was almost boiling. I noticed too there was a thin sulphurous\r\nscum drifting upon its coiling water. Almost immediately came a turn in\r\nthe ravine, and the indistinct blue horizon. The nearer sea was\r\nflashing the sun from a myriad facets. I saw my death before me; but I\r\nwas hot and panting, with the warm blood oozing out on my face and\r\nrunning pleasantly through my veins. I felt more than a touch of\r\nexultation too, at having distanced my pursuers. It was not in me then\r\nto go out and drown myself yet. I stared back the way I had come.\r\n\r\nI listened. Save for the hum of the gnats and the chirp of some small\r\ninsects that hopped among the thorns, the air was absolutely still.\r\nThen came the yelp of a dog, very faint, and a chattering and\r\ngibbering, the snap of a whip, and voices. They grew louder, then\r\nfainter again. The noise receded up the stream and faded away. For a\r\nwhile the chase was over; but I knew now how much hope of help for me\r\nlay in the Beast People.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\nA PARLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI turned again and went on down towards the sea. I found the hot stream\r\nbroadened out to a shallow, weedy sand, in which an abundance of crabs\r\nand long-bodied, many-legged creatures started from my footfall. I\r\nwalked to the very edge of the salt water, and then I felt I was safe.\r\nI turned and stared, arms akimbo, at the thick green behind me, into\r\nwhich the steamy ravine cut like a smoking gash. But, as I say, I was\r\ntoo full of excitement and (a true saying, though those who have never\r\nknown danger may doubt it) too desperate to die.\r\n\r\nThen it came into my head that there was one chance before me yet.\r\nWhile Moreau and Montgomery and their bestial rabble chased me through\r\nthe island, might I not go round the beach until I came to their\r\nenclosure,—make a flank march upon them, in fact, and then with a rock\r\nlugged out of their loosely-built wall, perhaps, smash in the lock of\r\nthe smaller door and see what I could find (knife, pistol, or what not)\r\nto fight them with when they returned? It was at any rate something to\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nSo I turned to the westward and walked along by the water’s edge. The\r\nsetting sun flashed his blinding heat into my eyes. The slight Pacific\r\ntide was running in with a gentle ripple. Presently the shore fell away\r\nsouthward, and the sun came round upon my right hand. Then suddenly,\r\nfar in front of me, I saw first one and then several figures emerging\r\nfrom the bushes,—Moreau, with his grey staghound, then Montgomery, and\r\ntwo others. At that I stopped.\r\n\r\nThey saw me, and began gesticulating and advancing. I stood watching\r\nthem approach. The two Beast Men came running forward to cut me off\r\nfrom the undergrowth, inland. Montgomery came, running also, but\r\nstraight towards me. Moreau followed slower with the dog.\r\n\r\nAt last I roused myself from my inaction, and turning seaward walked\r\nstraight into the water. The water was very shallow at first. I was\r\nthirty yards out before the waves reached to my waist. Dimly I could\r\nsee the intertidal creatures darting away from my feet.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing, man?” cried Montgomery.\r\n\r\nI turned, standing waist deep, and stared at them. Montgomery stood\r\npanting at the margin of the water. His face was bright-red with\r\nexertion, his long flaxen hair blown about his head, and his dropping\r\nnether lip showed his irregular teeth. Moreau was just coming up, his\r\nface pale and firm, and the dog at his hand barked at me. Both men had\r\nheavy whips. Farther up the beach stared the Beast Men.\r\n\r\n“What am I doing? I am going to drown myself,” said I.\r\n\r\nMontgomery and Moreau looked at each other. “Why?” asked Moreau.\r\n\r\n“Because that is better than being tortured by you.”\r\n\r\n“I told you so,” said Montgomery, and Moreau said something in a low\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n“What makes you think I shall torture you?” asked Moreau.\r\n\r\n“What I saw,” I said. “And those—yonder.”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Moreau, and held up his hand.\r\n\r\n“I will not,” said I. “They were men: what are they now? I at least\r\nwill not be like them.”\r\n\r\nI looked past my interlocutors. Up the beach were M’ling, Montgomery’s\r\nattendant, and one of the white-swathed brutes from the boat. Farther\r\nup, in the shadow of the trees, I saw my little Ape-man, and behind him\r\nsome other dim figures.\r\n\r\n“Who are these creatures?” said I, pointing to them and raising my\r\nvoice more and more that it might reach them. “They were men, men like\r\nyourselves, whom you have infected with some bestial taint,—men whom\r\nyou have enslaved, and whom you still fear.\r\n\r\n“You who listen,” I cried, pointing now to Moreau and shouting past him\r\nto the Beast Men,—“You who listen! Do you not see these men still fear\r\nyou, go in dread of you? Why, then, do you fear them? You are many—”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake,” cried Montgomery, “stop that, Prendick!”\r\n\r\n“Prendick!” cried Moreau.\r\n\r\nThey both shouted together, as if to drown my voice; and behind them\r\nlowered the staring faces of the Beast Men, wondering, their deformed\r\nhands hanging down, their shoulders hunched up. They seemed, as I\r\nfancied, to be trying to understand me, to remember, I thought,\r\nsomething of their human past.\r\n\r\nI went on shouting, I scarcely remember what,—that Moreau and\r\nMontgomery could be killed, that they were not to be feared: that was\r\nthe burden of what I put into the heads of the Beast People. I saw the\r\ngreen-eyed man in the dark rags, who had met me on the evening of my\r\narrival, come out from among the trees, and others followed him, to\r\nhear me better. At last for want of breath I paused.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me for a moment,” said the steady voice of Moreau; “and then\r\nsay what you will.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said I.\r\n\r\nHe coughed, thought, then shouted: “Latin, Prendick! bad Latin,\r\nschoolboy Latin; but try and understand. _Hi non sunt homines; sunt\r\nanimalia qui nos habemus_—vivisected. A humanising process. I will\r\nexplain. Come ashore.”\r\n\r\nI laughed. “A pretty story,” said I. “They talk, build houses. They\r\nwere men. It’s likely I’ll come ashore.”\r\n\r\n“The water just beyond where you stand is deep—and full of sharks.”\r\n\r\n“That’s my way,” said I. “Short and sharp. Presently.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute.” He took something out of his pocket that flashed back\r\nthe sun, and dropped the object at his feet. “That’s a loaded\r\nrevolver,” said he. “Montgomery here will do the same. Now we are going\r\nup the beach until you are satisfied the distance is safe. Then come\r\nand take the revolvers.”\r\n\r\n“Not I! You have a third between you.”\r\n\r\n“I want you to think over things, Prendick. In the first place, I never\r\nasked you to come upon this island. If we vivisected men, we should\r\nimport men, not beasts. In the next, we had you drugged last night, had\r\nwe wanted to work you any mischief; and in the next, now your first\r\npanic is over and you can think a little, is Montgomery here quite up\r\nto the character you give him? We have chased you for your good.\r\nBecause this island is full of—inimical phenomena. Besides, why should\r\nwe want to shoot you when you have just offered to drown yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Why did you set—your people onto me when I was in the hut?”\r\n\r\n“We felt sure of catching you, and bringing you out of danger.\r\nAfterwards we drew away from the scent, for your good.”\r\n\r\nI mused. It seemed just possible. Then I remembered something again.\r\n“But I saw,” said I, “in the enclosure—”\r\n\r\n“That was the puma.”\r\n\r\n“Look here, Prendick,” said Montgomery, “you’re a silly ass! Come out\r\nof the water and take these revolvers, and talk. We can’t do anything\r\nmore than we could do now.”\r\n\r\nI will confess that then, and indeed always, I distrusted and dreaded\r\nMoreau; but Montgomery was a man I felt I understood.\r\n\r\n“Go up the beach,” said I, after thinking, and added, “holding your\r\nhands up.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t do that,” said Montgomery, with an explanatory nod over his\r\nshoulder. “Undignified.”\r\n\r\n“Go up to the trees, then,” said I, “as you please.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a damned silly ceremony,” said Montgomery.\r\n\r\nBoth turned and faced the six or seven grotesque creatures, who stood\r\nthere in the sunlight, solid, casting shadows, moving, and yet so\r\nincredibly unreal. Montgomery cracked his whip at them, and forthwith\r\nthey all turned and fled helter-skelter into the trees; and when\r\nMontgomery and Moreau were at a distance I judged sufficient, I waded\r\nashore, and picked up and examined the revolvers. To satisfy myself\r\nagainst the subtlest trickery, I discharged one at a round lump of\r\nlava, and had the satisfaction of seeing the stone pulverised and the\r\nbeach splashed with lead. Still I hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take the risk,” said I, at last; and with a revolver in each hand\r\nI walked up the beach towards them.\r\n\r\n“That’s better,” said Moreau, without affectation. “As it is, you have\r\nwasted the best part of my day with your confounded imagination.” And\r\nwith a touch of contempt which humiliated me, he and Montgomery turned\r\nand went on in silence before me.\r\n\r\nThe knot of Beast Men, still wondering, stood back among the trees. I\r\npassed them as serenely as possible. One started to follow me, but\r\nretreated again when Montgomery cracked his whip. The rest stood\r\nsilent—watching. They may once have been animals; but I never before\r\nsaw an animal trying to think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\nDOCTOR MOREAU EXPLAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“And now, Prendick, I will explain,” said Doctor Moreau, so soon as we\r\nhad eaten and drunk. “I must confess that you are the most dictatorial\r\nguest I ever entertained. I warn you that this is the last I shall do\r\nto oblige you. The next thing you threaten to commit suicide about, I\r\nshan’t do,—even at some personal inconvenience.”\r\n\r\nHe sat in my deck chair, a cigar half consumed in his white,\r\ndexterous-looking fingers. The light of the swinging lamp fell on his\r\nwhite hair; he stared through the little window out at the starlight. I\r\nsat as far away from him as possible, the table between us and the\r\nrevolvers to hand. Montgomery was not present. I did not care to be\r\nwith the two of them in such a little room.\r\n\r\n“You admit that the vivisected human being, as you called it, is, after\r\nall, only the puma?” said Moreau. He had made me visit that horror in\r\nthe inner room, to assure myself of its inhumanity.\r\n\r\n“It is the puma,” I said, “still alive, but so cut and mutilated as I\r\npray I may never see living flesh again. Of all vile—”\r\n\r\n“Never mind that,” said Moreau; “at least, spare me those youthful\r\nhorrors. Montgomery used to be just the same. You admit that it is the\r\npuma. Now be quiet, while I reel off my physiological lecture to you.”\r\n\r\nAnd forthwith, beginning in the tone of a man supremely bored, but\r\npresently warming a little, he explained his work to me. He was very\r\nsimple and convincing. Now and then there was a touch of sarcasm in his\r\nvoice. Presently I found myself hot with shame at our mutual positions.\r\n\r\nThe creatures I had seen were not men, had never been men. They were\r\nanimals, humanised animals,—triumphs of vivisection.\r\n\r\n“You forget all that a skilled vivisector can do with living things,”\r\nsaid Moreau. “For my own part, I’m puzzled why the things I have done\r\nhere have not been done before. Small efforts, of course, have been\r\nmade,—amputation, tongue-cutting, excisions. Of course you know a\r\nsquint may be induced or cured by surgery? Then in the case of\r\nexcisions you have all kinds of secondary changes, pigmentary\r\ndisturbances, modifications of the passions, alterations in the\r\nsecretion of fatty tissue. I have no doubt you have heard of these\r\nthings?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said I. “But these foul creatures of yours—”\r\n\r\n“All in good time,” said he, waving his hand at me; “I am only\r\nbeginning. Those are trivial cases of alteration. Surgery can do better\r\nthings than that. There is building up as well as breaking down and\r\nchanging. You have heard, perhaps, of a common surgical operation\r\nresorted to in cases where the nose has been destroyed: a flap of skin\r\nis cut from the forehead, turned down on the nose, and heals in the new\r\nposition. This is a kind of grafting in a new position of part of an\r\nanimal upon itself. Grafting of freshly obtained material from another\r\nanimal is also possible,—the case of teeth, for example. The grafting\r\nof skin and bone is done to facilitate healing: the surgeon places in\r\nthe middle of the wound pieces of skin snipped from another animal, or\r\nfragments of bone from a victim freshly killed. Hunter’s\r\ncock-spur—possibly you have heard of that—flourished on the bull’s\r\nneck; and the rhinoceros rats of the Algerian zouaves are also to be\r\nthought of,—monsters manufactured by transferring a slip from the tail\r\nof an ordinary rat to its snout, and allowing it to heal in that\r\nposition.”\r\n\r\n“Monsters manufactured!” said I. “Then you mean to tell me—”\r\n\r\n“Yes. These creatures you have seen are animals carven and wrought into\r\nnew shapes. To that, to the study of the plasticity of living forms, my\r\nlife has been devoted. I have studied for years, gaining in knowledge\r\nas I go. I see you look horrified, and yet I am telling you nothing\r\nnew. It all lay in the surface of practical anatomy years ago, but no\r\none had the temerity to touch it. It is not simply the outward form of\r\nan animal which I can change. The physiology, the chemical rhythm of\r\nthe creature, may also be made to undergo an enduring modification,—of\r\nwhich vaccination and other methods of inoculation with living or dead\r\nmatter are examples that will, no doubt, be familiar to you. A similar\r\noperation is the transfusion of blood,—with which subject, indeed, I\r\nbegan. These are all familiar cases. Less so, and probably far more\r\nextensive, were the operations of those mediaeval practitioners who\r\nmade dwarfs and beggar-cripples, show-monsters,—some vestiges of whose\r\nart still remain in the preliminary manipulation of the young\r\nmountebank or contortionist. Victor Hugo gives an account of them in\r\n‘L’Homme qui Rit.’—But perhaps my meaning grows plain now. You begin to\r\nsee that it is a possible thing to transplant tissue from one part of\r\nan animal to another, or from one animal to another; to alter its\r\nchemical reactions and methods of growth; to modify the articulations\r\nof its limbs; and, indeed, to change it in its most intimate structure.\r\n\r\n“And yet this extraordinary branch of knowledge has never been sought\r\nas an end, and systematically, by modern investigators until I took it\r\nup! Some such things have been hit upon in the last resort of surgery;\r\nmost of the kindred evidence that will recur to your mind has been\r\ndemonstrated as it were by accident,—by tyrants, by criminals, by the\r\nbreeders of horses and dogs, by all kinds of untrained clumsy-handed\r\nmen working for their own immediate ends. I was the first man to take\r\nup this question armed with antiseptic surgery, and with a really\r\nscientific knowledge of the laws of growth. Yet one would imagine it\r\nmust have been practised in secret before. Such creatures as the\r\nSiamese Twins—And in the vaults of the Inquisition. No doubt their\r\nchief aim was artistic torture, but some at least of the inquisitors\r\nmust have had a touch of scientific curiosity.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, “these things—these animals talk!”\r\n\r\nHe said that was so, and proceeded to point out that the possibility of\r\nvivisection does not stop at a mere physical metamorphosis. A pig may\r\nbe educated. The mental structure is even less determinate than the\r\nbodily. In our growing science of hypnotism we find the promise of a\r\npossibility of superseding old inherent instincts by new suggestions,\r\ngrafting upon or replacing the inherited fixed ideas. Very much indeed\r\nof what we call moral education, he said, is such an artificial\r\nmodification and perversion of instinct; pugnacity is trained into\r\ncourageous self-sacrifice, and suppressed sexuality into religious\r\nemotion. And the great difference between man and monkey is in the\r\nlarynx, he continued,—in the incapacity to frame delicately different\r\nsound-symbols by which thought could be sustained. In this I failed to\r\nagree with him, but with a certain incivility he declined to notice my\r\nobjection. He repeated that the thing was so, and continued his account\r\nof his work.\r\n\r\nI asked him why he had taken the human form as a model. There seemed to\r\nme then, and there still seems to me now, a strange wickedness for that\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nHe confessed that he had chosen that form by chance. “I might just as\r\nwell have worked to form sheep into llamas and llamas into sheep. I\r\nsuppose there is something in the human form that appeals to the\r\nartistic turn of mind more powerfully than any animal shape can. But\r\nI’ve not confined myself to man-making. Once or twice—” He was silent,\r\nfor a minute perhaps. “These years! How they have slipped by! And here\r\nI have wasted a day saving your life, and am now wasting an hour\r\nexplaining myself!”\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, “I still do not understand. Where is your justification\r\nfor inflicting all this pain? The only thing that could excuse\r\nvivisection to me would be some application—”\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” said he. “But, you see, I am differently constituted. We\r\nare on different platforms. You are a materialist.”\r\n\r\n“I am _not_ a materialist,” I began hotly.\r\n\r\n“In my view—in my view. For it is just this question of pain that parts\r\nus. So long as visible or audible pain turns you sick; so long as your\r\nown pains drive you; so long as pain underlies your propositions about\r\nsin,—so long, I tell you, you are an animal, thinking a little less\r\nobscurely what an animal feels. This pain—”\r\n\r\nI gave an impatient shrug at such sophistry.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but it is such a little thing! A mind truly opened to what science\r\nhas to teach must see that it is a little thing. It may be that save in\r\nthis little planet, this speck of cosmic dust, invisible long before\r\nthe nearest star could be attained—it may be, I say, that nowhere else\r\ndoes this thing called pain occur. But the laws we feel our way\r\ntowards—Why, even on this earth, even among living things, what pain is\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he drew a little penknife from his pocket, opened the\r\nsmaller blade, and moved his chair so that I could see his thigh. Then,\r\nchoosing the place deliberately, he drove the blade into his leg and\r\nwithdrew it.\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” he said, “you have seen that before. It does not hurt a\r\npin-prick. But what does it show? The capacity for pain is not needed\r\nin the muscle, and it is not placed there,—is but little needed in the\r\nskin, and only here and there over the thigh is a spot capable of\r\nfeeling pain. Pain is simply our intrinsic medical adviser to warn us\r\nand stimulate us. Not all living flesh is painful; nor is all nerve,\r\nnot even all sensory nerve. There’s no taint of pain, real pain, in the\r\nsensations of the optic nerve. If you wound the optic nerve, you merely\r\nsee flashes of light,—just as disease of the auditory nerve merely\r\nmeans a humming in our ears. Plants do not feel pain, nor the lower\r\nanimals; it’s possible that such animals as the starfish and crayfish\r\ndo not feel pain at all. Then with men, the more intelligent they\r\nbecome, the more intelligently they will see after their own welfare,\r\nand the less they will need the goad to keep them out of danger. I\r\nnever yet heard of a useless thing that was not ground out of existence\r\nby evolution sooner or later. Did you? And pain gets needless.\r\n\r\n“Then I am a religious man, Prendick, as every sane man must be. It may\r\nbe, I fancy, that I have seen more of the ways of this world’s Maker\r\nthan you,—for I have sought his laws, in _my_ way, all my life, while\r\nyou, I understand, have been collecting butterflies. And I tell you,\r\npleasure and pain have nothing to do with heaven or hell. Pleasure and\r\npain—bah! What is your theologian’s ecstasy but Mahomet’s houri in the\r\ndark? This store which men and women set on pleasure and pain,\r\nPrendick, is the mark of the beast upon them,—the mark of the beast\r\nfrom which they came! Pain, pain and pleasure, they are for us only so\r\nlong as we wriggle in the dust.\r\n\r\n“You see, I went on with this research just the way it led me. That is\r\nthe only way I ever heard of true research going. I asked a question,\r\ndevised some method of obtaining an answer, and got a fresh question.\r\nWas this possible or that possible? You cannot imagine what this means\r\nto an investigator, what an intellectual passion grows upon him! You\r\ncannot imagine the strange, colourless delight of these intellectual\r\ndesires! The thing before you is no longer an animal, a\r\nfellow-creature, but a problem! Sympathetic pain,—all I know of it I\r\nremember as a thing I used to suffer from years ago. I wanted—it was\r\nthe one thing I wanted—to find out the extreme limit of plasticity in a\r\nliving shape.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, “the thing is an abomination—”\r\n\r\n“To this day I have never troubled about the ethics of the matter,” he\r\ncontinued. “The study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as\r\nNature. I have gone on, not heeding anything but the question I was\r\npursuing; and the material has—dripped into the huts yonder. It is\r\nnearly eleven years since we came here, I and Montgomery and six\r\nKanakas. I remember the green stillness of the island and the empty\r\nocean about us, as though it was yesterday. The place seemed waiting\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\n“The stores were landed and the house was built. The Kanakas founded\r\nsome huts near the ravine. I went to work here upon what I had brought\r\nwith me. There were some disagreeable things happened at first. I began\r\nwith a sheep, and killed it after a day and a half by a slip of the\r\nscalpel. I took another sheep, and made a thing of pain and fear and\r\nleft it bound up to heal. It looked quite human to me when I had\r\nfinished it; but when I went to it I was discontented with it. It\r\nremembered me, and was terrified beyond imagination; and it had no more\r\nthan the wits of a sheep. The more I looked at it the clumsier it\r\nseemed, until at last I put the monster out of its misery. These\r\nanimals without courage, these fear-haunted, pain-driven things,\r\nwithout a spark of pugnacious energy to face torment,—they are no good\r\nfor man-making.\r\n\r\n“Then I took a gorilla I had; and upon that, working with infinite care\r\nand mastering difficulty after difficulty, I made my first man. All the\r\nweek, night and day, I moulded him. With him it was chiefly the brain\r\nthat needed moulding; much had to be added, much changed. I thought him\r\na fair specimen of the negroid type when I had finished him, and he lay\r\nbandaged, bound, and motionless before me. It was only when his life\r\nwas assured that I left him and came into this room again, and found\r\nMontgomery much as you are. He had heard some of the cries as the thing\r\ngrew human,—cries like those that disturbed _you_ so. I didn’t take him\r\ncompletely into my confidence at first. And the Kanakas too, had\r\nrealised something of it. They were scared out of their wits by the\r\nsight of me. I got Montgomery over to me—in a way; but I and he had the\r\nhardest job to prevent the Kanakas deserting. Finally they did; and so\r\nwe lost the yacht. I spent many days educating the brute,—altogether I\r\nhad him for three or four months. I taught him the rudiments of\r\nEnglish; gave him ideas of counting; even made the thing read the\r\nalphabet. But at that he was slow, though I’ve met with idiots slower.\r\nHe began with a clean sheet, mentally; had no memories left in his mind\r\nof what he had been. When his scars were quite healed, and he was no\r\nlonger anything but painful and stiff, and able to converse a little, I\r\ntook him yonder and introduced him to the Kanakas as an interesting\r\nstowaway.\r\n\r\n“They were horribly afraid of him at first, somehow,—which offended me\r\nrather, for I was conceited about him; but his ways seemed so mild, and\r\nhe was so abject, that after a time they received him and took his\r\neducation in hand. He was quick to learn, very imitative and adaptive,\r\nand built himself a hovel rather better, it seemed to me, than their\r\nown shanties. There was one among the boys a bit of a missionary, and\r\nhe taught the thing to read, or at least to pick out letters, and gave\r\nhim some rudimentary ideas of morality; but it seems the beast’s habits\r\nwere not all that is desirable.\r\n\r\n“I rested from work for some days after this, and was in a mind to\r\nwrite an account of the whole affair to wake up English physiology.\r\nThen I came upon the creature squatting up in a tree and gibbering at\r\ntwo of the Kanakas who had been teasing him. I threatened him, told him\r\nthe inhumanity of such a proceeding, aroused his sense of shame, and\r\ncame home resolved to do better before I took my work back to England.\r\nI have been doing better. But somehow the things drift back again: the\r\nstubborn beast-flesh grows day by day back again. But I mean to do\r\nbetter things still. I mean to conquer that. This puma—\r\n\r\n“But that’s the story. All the Kanaka boys are dead now; one fell\r\noverboard of the launch, and one died of a wounded heel that he\r\npoisoned in some way with plant-juice. Three went away in the yacht,\r\nand I suppose and hope were drowned. The other one—was killed. Well, I\r\nhave replaced them. Montgomery went on much as you are disposed to do\r\nat first, and then—”\r\n\r\n“What became of the other one?” said I, sharply,—“the other Kanaka who\r\nwas killed?”\r\n\r\n“The fact is, after I had made a number of human creatures I made a\r\nThing—” He hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said I.\r\n\r\n“It was killed.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” said I; “do you mean to say—”\r\n\r\n“It killed the Kanaka—yes. It killed several other things that it\r\ncaught. We chased it for a couple of days. It only got loose by\r\naccident—I never meant it to get away. It wasn’t finished. It was\r\npurely an experiment. It was a limbless thing, with a horrible face,\r\nthat writhed along the ground in a serpentine fashion. It was immensely\r\nstrong, and in infuriating pain. It lurked in the woods for some days,\r\nuntil we hunted it; and then it wriggled into the northern part of the\r\nisland, and we divided the party to close in upon it. Montgomery\r\ninsisted upon coming with me. The man had a rifle; and when his body\r\nwas found, one of the barrels was curved into the shape of an S and\r\nvery nearly bitten through. Montgomery shot the thing. After that I\r\nstuck to the ideal of humanity—except for little things.”\r\n\r\nHe became silent. I sat in silence watching his face.\r\n\r\n“So for twenty years altogether—counting nine years in England—I have\r\nbeen going on; and there is still something in everything I do that\r\ndefeats me, makes me dissatisfied, challenges me to further effort.\r\nSometimes I rise above my level, sometimes I fall below it; but always\r\nI fall short of the things I dream. The human shape I can get now,\r\nalmost with ease, so that it is lithe and graceful, or thick and\r\nstrong; but often there is trouble with the hands and the\r\nclaws,—painful things, that I dare not shape too freely. But it is in\r\nthe subtle grafting and reshaping one must needs do to the brain that\r\nmy trouble lies. The intelligence is often oddly low, with\r\nunaccountable blank ends, unexpected gaps. And least satisfactory of\r\nall is something that I cannot touch, somewhere—I cannot determine\r\nwhere—in the seat of the emotions. Cravings, instincts, desires that\r\nharm humanity, a strange hidden reservoir to burst forth suddenly and\r\ninundate the whole being of the creature with anger, hate, or fear.\r\nThese creatures of mine seemed strange and uncanny to you so soon as\r\nyou began to observe them; but to me, just after I make them, they seem\r\nto be indisputably human beings. It’s afterwards, as I observe them,\r\nthat the persuasion fades. First one animal trait, then another, creeps\r\nto the surface and stares out at me. But I will conquer yet! Each time\r\nI dip a living creature into the bath of burning pain, I say, ‘This\r\ntime I will burn out all the animal; this time I will make a rational\r\ncreature of my own!’ After all, what is ten years? Men have been a\r\nhundred thousand in the making.” He thought darkly. “But I am drawing\r\nnear the fastness. This puma of mine—” After a silence, “And they\r\nrevert. As soon as my hand is taken from them the beast begins to creep\r\nback, begins to assert itself again.” Another long silence.\r\n\r\n“Then you take the things you make into those dens?” said I.\r\n\r\n“They go. I turn them out when I begin to feel the beast in them, and\r\npresently they wander there. They all dread this house and me. There is\r\na kind of travesty of humanity over there. Montgomery knows about it,\r\nfor he interferes in their affairs. He has trained one or two of them\r\nto our service. He’s ashamed of it, but I believe he half likes some of\r\nthose beasts. It’s his business, not mine. They only sicken me with a\r\nsense of failure. I take no interest in them. I fancy they follow in\r\nthe lines the Kanaka missionary marked out, and have a kind of mockery\r\nof a rational life, poor beasts! There’s something they call the Law.\r\nSing hymns about ‘all thine.’ They build themselves their dens, gather\r\nfruit, and pull herbs—marry even. But I can see through it all, see\r\ninto their very souls, and see there nothing but the souls of beasts,\r\nbeasts that perish, anger and the lusts to live and gratify\r\nthemselves.—Yet they’re odd; complex, like everything else alive. There\r\nis a kind of upward striving in them, part vanity, part waste sexual\r\nemotion, part waste curiosity. It only mocks me. I have some hope of\r\nthis puma. I have worked hard at her head and brain—\r\n\r\n“And now,” said he, standing up after a long gap of silence, during\r\nwhich we had each pursued our own thoughts, “what do you think? Are you\r\nin fear of me still?”\r\n\r\nI looked at him, and saw but a white-faced, white-haired man, with calm\r\neyes. Save for his serenity, the touch almost of beauty that resulted\r\nfrom his set tranquillity and his magnificent build, he might have\r\npassed muster among a hundred other comfortable old gentlemen. Then I\r\nshivered. By way of answer to his second question, I handed him a\r\nrevolver with either hand.\r\n\r\n“Keep them,” he said, and snatched at a yawn. He stood up, stared at me\r\nfor a moment, and smiled. “You have had two eventful days,” said he. “I\r\nshould advise some sleep. I’m glad it’s all clear. Good-night.” He\r\nthought me over for a moment, then went out by the inner door.\r\n\r\nI immediately turned the key in the outer one. I sat down again; sat\r\nfor a time in a kind of stagnant mood, so weary, emotionally, mentally,\r\nand physically, that I could not think beyond the point at which he had\r\nleft me. The black window stared at me like an eye. At last with an\r\neffort I put out the light and got into the hammock. Very soon I was\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\nCONCERNING THE BEAST FOLK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI woke early. Moreau’s explanation stood before my mind, clear and\r\ndefinite, from the moment of my awakening. I got out of the hammock and\r\nwent to the door to assure myself that the key was turned. Then I tried\r\nthe window-bar, and found it firmly fixed. That these man-like\r\ncreatures were in truth only bestial monsters, mere grotesque\r\ntravesties of men, filled me with a vague uncertainty of their\r\npossibilities which was far worse than any definite fear.\r\n\r\nA tapping came at the door, and I heard the glutinous accents of M’ling\r\nspeaking. I pocketed one of the revolvers (keeping one hand upon it),\r\nand opened to him.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, sair,” he said, bringing in, in addition to the\r\ncustomary herb-breakfast, an ill-cooked rabbit. Montgomery followed\r\nhim. His roving eye caught the position of my arm and he smiled askew.\r\n\r\nThe puma was resting to heal that day; but Moreau, who was singularly\r\nsolitary in his habits, did not join us. I talked with Montgomery to\r\nclear my ideas of the way in which the Beast Folk lived. In particular,\r\nI was urgent to know how these inhuman monsters were kept from falling\r\nupon Moreau and Montgomery and from rending one another. He explained\r\nto me that the comparative safety of Moreau and himself was due to the\r\nlimited mental scope of these monsters. In spite of their increased\r\nintelligence and the tendency of their animal instincts to reawaken,\r\nthey had certain fixed ideas implanted by Moreau in their minds, which\r\nabsolutely bounded their imaginations. They were really hypnotised; had\r\nbeen told that certain things were impossible, and that certain things\r\nwere not to be done, and these prohibitions were woven into the texture\r\nof their minds beyond any possibility of disobedience or dispute.\r\n\r\nCertain matters, however, in which old instinct was at war with\r\nMoreau’s convenience, were in a less stable condition. A series of\r\npropositions called the Law (I had already heard them recited) battled\r\nin their minds with the deep-seated, ever-rebellious cravings of their\r\nanimal natures. This Law they were ever repeating, I found, and ever\r\nbreaking. Both Montgomery and Moreau displayed particular solicitude to\r\nkeep them ignorant of the taste of blood; they feared the inevitable\r\nsuggestions of that flavour. Montgomery told me that the Law,\r\nespecially among the feline Beast People, became oddly weakened about\r\nnightfall; that then the animal was at its strongest; that a spirit of\r\nadventure sprang up in them at the dusk, when they would dare things\r\nthey never seemed to dream about by day. To that I owed my stalking by\r\nthe Leopard-man, on the night of my arrival. But during these earlier\r\ndays of my stay they broke the Law only furtively and after dark; in\r\nthe daylight there was a general atmosphere of respect for its\r\nmultifarious prohibitions.\r\n\r\nAnd here perhaps I may give a few general facts about the island and\r\nthe Beast People. The island, which was of irregular outline and lay\r\nlow upon the wide sea, had a total area, I suppose, of seven or eight\r\nsquare miles.[2] It was volcanic in origin, and was now fringed on\r\nthree sides by coral reefs; some fumaroles to the northward, and a hot\r\nspring, were the only vestiges of the forces that had long since\r\noriginated it. Now and then a faint quiver of earthquake would be\r\nsensible, and sometimes the ascent of the spire of smoke would be\r\nrendered tumultuous by gusts of steam; but that was all. The population\r\nof the island, Montgomery informed me, now numbered rather more than\r\nsixty of these strange creations of Moreau’s art, not counting the\r\nsmaller monstrosities which lived in the undergrowth and were without\r\nhuman form. Altogether he had made nearly a hundred and twenty; but\r\nmany had died, and others—like the writhing Footless Thing of which he\r\nhad told me—had come by violent ends. In answer to my question,\r\nMontgomery said that they actually bore offspring, but that these\r\ngenerally died. When they lived, Moreau took them and stamped the human\r\nform upon them. There was no evidence of the inheritance of their\r\nacquired human characteristics. The females were less numerous than the\r\nmales, and liable to much furtive persecution in spite of the monogamy\r\nthe Law enjoined.\r\n\r\n [2]This description corresponds in every respect to Noble’s Isle.—C.\r\n E. P.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible for me to describe these Beast People in detail;\r\nmy eye has had no training in details, and unhappily I cannot sketch.\r\nMost striking, perhaps, in their general appearance was the\r\ndisproportion between the legs of these creatures and the length of\r\ntheir bodies; and yet—so relative is our idea of grace—my eye became\r\nhabituated to their forms, and at last I even fell in with their\r\npersuasion that my own long thighs were ungainly. Another point was the\r\nforward carriage of the head and the clumsy and inhuman curvature of\r\nthe spine. Even the Ape-man lacked that inward sinuous curve of the\r\nback which makes the human figure so graceful. Most had their shoulders\r\nhunched clumsily, and their short forearms hung weakly at their sides.\r\nFew of them were conspicuously hairy, at least until the end of my time\r\nupon the island.\r\n\r\nThe next most obvious deformity was in their faces, almost all of which\r\nwere prognathous, malformed about the ears, with large and protuberant\r\nnoses, very furry or very bristly hair, and often strangely-coloured or\r\nstrangely-placed eyes. None could laugh, though the Ape-man had a\r\nchattering titter. Beyond these general characters their heads had\r\nlittle in common; each preserved the quality of its particular species:\r\nthe human mark distorted but did not hide the leopard, the ox, or the\r\nsow, or other animal or animals, from which the creature had been\r\nmoulded. The voices, too, varied exceedingly. The hands were always\r\nmalformed; and though some surprised me by their unexpected human\r\nappearance, almost all were deficient in the number of the digits,\r\nclumsy about the finger-nails, and lacking any tactile sensibility.\r\n\r\nThe two most formidable Animal Men were my Leopard-man and a creature\r\nmade of hyena and swine. Larger than these were the three\r\nbull-creatures who pulled in the boat. Then came the silvery-hairy-man,\r\nwho was also the Sayer of the Law, M’ling, and a satyr-like creature of\r\nape and goat. There were three Swine-men and a Swine-woman, a\r\nmare-rhinoceros-creature, and several other females whose sources I did\r\nnot ascertain. There were several wolf-creatures, a bear-bull, and a\r\nSaint-Bernard-man. I have already described the Ape-man, and there was\r\na particularly hateful (and evil-smelling) old woman made of vixen and\r\nbear, whom I hated from the beginning. She was said to be a passionate\r\nvotary of the Law. Smaller creatures were certain dappled youths and my\r\nlittle sloth-creature. But enough of this catalogue.\r\n\r\nAt first I had a shivering horror of the brutes, felt all too keenly\r\nthat they were still brutes; but insensibly I became a little\r\nhabituated to the idea of them, and moreover I was affected by\r\nMontgomery’s attitude towards them. He had been with them so long that\r\nhe had come to regard them as almost normal human beings. His London\r\ndays seemed a glorious, impossible past to him. Only once in a year or\r\nso did he go to Africa to deal with Moreau’s agent, a trader in animals\r\nthere. He hardly met the finest type of mankind in that seafaring\r\nvillage of Spanish mongrels. The men aboard-ship, he told me, seemed at\r\nfirst just as strange to him as the Beast Men seemed to me,—unnaturally\r\nlong in the leg, flat in the face, prominent in the forehead,\r\nsuspicious, dangerous, and cold-hearted. In fact, he did not like men:\r\nhis heart had warmed to me, he thought, because he had saved my life. I\r\nfancied even then that he had a sneaking kindness for some of these\r\nmetamorphosed brutes, a vicious sympathy with some of their ways, but\r\nthat he attempted to veil it from me at first.\r\n\r\nM’ling, the black-faced man, Montgomery’s attendant, the first of the\r\nBeast Folk I had encountered, did not live with the others across the\r\nisland, but in a small kennel at the back of the enclosure. The\r\ncreature was scarcely so intelligent as the Ape-man, but far more\r\ndocile, and the most human-looking of all the Beast Folk; and\r\nMontgomery had trained it to prepare food, and indeed to discharge all\r\nthe trivial domestic offices that were required. It was a complex\r\ntrophy of Moreau’s horrible skill,—a bear, tainted with dog and ox, and\r\none of the most elaborately made of all his creatures. It treated\r\nMontgomery with a strange tenderness and devotion. Sometimes he would\r\nnotice it, pat it, call it half-mocking, half-jocular names, and so\r\nmake it caper with extraordinary delight; sometimes he would ill-treat\r\nit, especially after he had been at the whiskey, kicking it, beating\r\nit, pelting it with stones or lighted fusees. But whether he treated it\r\nwell or ill, it loved nothing so much as to be near him.\r\n\r\nI say I became habituated to the Beast People, that a thousand things\r\nwhich had seemed unnatural and repulsive speedily became natural and\r\nordinary to me. I suppose everything in existence takes its colour from\r\nthe average hue of our surroundings. Montgomery and Moreau were too\r\npeculiar and individual to keep my general impressions of humanity well\r\ndefined. I would see one of the clumsy bovine-creatures who worked the\r\nlaunch treading heavily through the undergrowth, and find myself\r\nasking, trying hard to recall, how he differed from some really human\r\nyokel trudging home from his mechanical labours; or I would meet the\r\nFox-bear woman’s vulpine, shifty face, strangely human in its\r\nspeculative cunning, and even imagine I had met it before in some city\r\nbyway.\r\n\r\nYet every now and then the beast would flash out upon me beyond doubt\r\nor denial. An ugly-looking man, a hunch-backed human savage to all\r\nappearance, squatting in the aperture of one of the dens, would stretch\r\nhis arms and yawn, showing with startling suddenness scissor-edged\r\nincisors and sabre-like canines, keen and brilliant as knives. Or in\r\nsome narrow pathway, glancing with a transitory daring into the eyes of\r\nsome lithe, white-swathed female figure, I would suddenly see (with a\r\nspasmodic revulsion) that she had slit-like pupils, or glancing down\r\nnote the curving nail with which she held her shapeless wrap about her.\r\nIt is a curious thing, by the bye, for which I am quite unable to\r\naccount, that these weird creatures—the females, I mean—had in the\r\nearlier days of my stay an instinctive sense of their own repulsive\r\nclumsiness, and displayed in consequence a more than human regard for\r\nthe decency and decorum of extensive costume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\nHOW THE BEAST FOLK TASTE BLOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy inexperience as a writer betrays me, and I wander from the thread of\r\nmy story.\r\n\r\nAfter I had breakfasted with Montgomery, he took me across the island\r\nto see the fumarole and the source of the hot spring into whose\r\nscalding waters I had blundered on the previous day. Both of us carried\r\nwhips and loaded revolvers. While going through a leafy jungle on our\r\nroad thither, we heard a rabbit squealing. We stopped and listened, but\r\nwe heard no more; and presently we went on our way, and the incident\r\ndropped out of our minds. Montgomery called my attention to certain\r\nlittle pink animals with long hind-legs, that went leaping through the\r\nundergrowth. He told me they were creatures made of the offspring of\r\nthe Beast People, that Moreau had invented. He had fancied they might\r\nserve for meat, but a rabbit-like habit of devouring their young had\r\ndefeated this intention. I had already encountered some of these\r\ncreatures,—once during my moonlight flight from the Leopard-man, and\r\nonce during my pursuit by Moreau on the previous day. By chance, one\r\nhopping to avoid us leapt into the hole caused by the uprooting of a\r\nwind-blown tree; before it could extricate itself we managed to catch\r\nit. It spat like a cat, scratched and kicked vigorously with its\r\nhind-legs, and made an attempt to bite; but its teeth were too feeble\r\nto inflict more than a painless pinch. It seemed to me rather a pretty\r\nlittle creature; and as Montgomery stated that it never destroyed the\r\nturf by burrowing, and was very cleanly in its habits, I should imagine\r\nit might prove a convenient substitute for the common rabbit in\r\ngentlemen’s parks.\r\n\r\nWe also saw on our way the trunk of a tree barked in long strips and\r\nsplintered deeply. Montgomery called my attention to this. “Not to claw\r\nbark of trees, _that_ is the Law,” he said. “Much some of them care for\r\nit!” It was after this, I think, that we met the Satyr and the Ape-man.\r\nThe Satyr was a gleam of classical memory on the part of Moreau,—his\r\nface ovine in expression, like the coarser Hebrew type; his voice a\r\nharsh bleat, his nether extremities Satanic. He was gnawing the husk of\r\na pod-like fruit as he passed us. Both of them saluted Montgomery.\r\n\r\n“Hail,” said they, “to the Other with the Whip!”\r\n\r\n“There’s a Third with a Whip now,” said Montgomery. “So you’d better\r\nmind!”\r\n\r\n“Was he not made?” said the Ape-man. “He said—he said he was made.”\r\n\r\nThe Satyr-man looked curiously at me. “The Third with the Whip, he that\r\nwalks weeping into the sea, has a thin white face.”\r\n\r\n“He has a thin long whip,” said Montgomery.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday he bled and wept,” said the Satyr. “You never bleed nor\r\nweep. The Master does not bleed or weep.”\r\n\r\n“Ollendorffian beggar!” said Montgomery, “you’ll bleed and weep if you\r\ndon’t look out!”\r\n\r\n“He has five fingers, he is a five-man like me,” said the Ape-man.\r\n\r\n“Come along, Prendick,” said Montgomery, taking my arm; and I went on\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nThe Satyr and the Ape-man stood watching us and making other remarks to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n“He says nothing,” said the Satyr. “Men have voices.”\r\n\r\n“Yesterday he asked me of things to eat,” said the Ape-man. “He did not\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nThen they spoke inaudible things, and I heard the Satyr laughing.\r\n\r\nIt was on our way back that we came upon the dead rabbit. The red body\r\nof the wretched little beast was rent to pieces, many of the ribs\r\nstripped white, and the backbone indisputably gnawed.\r\n\r\nAt that Montgomery stopped. “Good God!” said he, stooping down, and\r\npicking up some of the crushed vertebrae to examine them more closely.\r\n“Good God!” he repeated, “what can this mean?”\r\n\r\n“Some carnivore of yours has remembered its old habits,” I said after a\r\npause. “This backbone has been bitten through.”\r\n\r\nHe stood staring, with his face white and his lip pulled askew. “I\r\ndon’t like this,” he said slowly.\r\n\r\n“I saw something of the same kind,” said I, “the first day I came\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“The devil you did! What was it?”\r\n\r\n“A rabbit with its head twisted off.”\r\n\r\n“The day you came here?”\r\n\r\n“The day I came here. In the undergrowth at the back of the enclosure,\r\nwhen I went out in the evening. The head was completely wrung off.”\r\n\r\nHe gave a long, low whistle.\r\n\r\n“And what is more, I have an idea which of your brutes did the thing.\r\nIt’s only a suspicion, you know. Before I came on the rabbit I saw one\r\nof your monsters drinking in the stream.”\r\n\r\n“Sucking his drink?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“‘Not to suck your drink; that is the Law.’ Much the brutes care for\r\nthe Law, eh? when Moreau’s not about!”\r\n\r\n“It was the brute who chased me.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Montgomery; “it’s just the way with carnivores. After\r\na kill, they drink. It’s the taste of blood, you know.—What was the\r\nbrute like?” he continued. “Would you know him again?” He glanced about\r\nus, standing astride over the mess of dead rabbit, his eyes roving\r\namong the shadows and screens of greenery, the lurking-places and\r\nambuscades of the forest that bounded us in. “The taste of blood,” he\r\nsaid again.\r\n\r\nHe took out his revolver, examined the cartridges in it and replaced\r\nit. Then he began to pull at his dropping lip.\r\n\r\n“I think I should know the brute again,” I said. “I stunned him. He\r\nought to have a handsome bruise on the forehead of him.”\r\n\r\n“But then we have to _prove_ that he killed the rabbit,” said\r\nMontgomery. “I wish I’d never brought the things here.”\r\n\r\nI should have gone on, but he stayed there thinking over the mangled\r\nrabbit in a puzzle-headed way. As it was, I went to such a distance\r\nthat the rabbit’s remains were hidden.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” I said.\r\n\r\nPresently he woke up and came towards me. “You see,” he said, almost in\r\na whisper, “they are all supposed to have a fixed idea against eating\r\nanything that runs on land. If some brute has by any accident tasted\r\nblood—”\r\n\r\nWe went on some way in silence. “I wonder what can have happened,” he\r\nsaid to himself. Then, after a pause again: “I did a foolish thing the\r\nother day. That servant of mine—I showed him how to skin and cook a\r\nrabbit. It’s odd—I saw him licking his hands—It never occurred to me.”\r\n\r\nThen: “We must put a stop to this. I must tell Moreau.”\r\n\r\nHe could think of nothing else on our homeward journey.\r\n\r\nMoreau took the matter even more seriously than Montgomery, and I need\r\nscarcely say that I was affected by their evident consternation.\r\n\r\n“We must make an example,” said Moreau. “I’ve no doubt in my own mind\r\nthat the Leopard-man was the sinner. But how can we prove it? I wish,\r\nMontgomery, you had kept your taste for meat in hand, and gone without\r\nthese exciting novelties. We may find ourselves in a mess yet, through\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I was a silly ass,” said Montgomery. “But the thing’s done now; and\r\nyou said I might have them, you know.”\r\n\r\n“We must see to the thing at once,” said Moreau. “I suppose if anything\r\nshould turn up, M’ling can take care of himself?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not so sure of M’ling,” said Montgomery. “I think I ought to know\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, Moreau, Montgomery, myself, and M’ling went across\r\nthe island to the huts in the ravine. We three were armed; M’ling\r\ncarried the little hatchet he used in chopping firewood, and some coils\r\nof wire. Moreau had a huge cowherd’s horn slung over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“You will see a gathering of the Beast People,” said Montgomery. “It is\r\na pretty sight!”\r\n\r\nMoreau said not a word on the way, but the expression of his heavy,\r\nwhite-fringed face was grimly set.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the ravine down which smoked the stream of hot water, and\r\nfollowed the winding pathway through the canebrakes until we reached a\r\nwide area covered over with a thick, powdery yellow substance which I\r\nbelieve was sulphur. Above the shoulder of a weedy bank the sea\r\nglittered. We came to a kind of shallow natural amphitheatre, and here\r\nthe four of us halted. Then Moreau sounded the horn, and broke the\r\nsleeping stillness of the tropical afternoon. He must have had strong\r\nlungs. The hooting note rose and rose amidst its echoes, to at last an\r\near-penetrating intensity.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Moreau, letting the curved instrument fall to his side\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nImmediately there was a crashing through the yellow canes, and a sound\r\nof voices from the dense green jungle that marked the morass through\r\nwhich I had run on the previous day. Then at three or four points on\r\nthe edge of the sulphurous area appeared the grotesque forms of the\r\nBeast People hurrying towards us. I could not help a creeping horror,\r\nas I perceived first one and then another trot out from the trees or\r\nreeds and come shambling along over the hot dust. But Moreau and\r\nMontgomery stood calmly enough; and, perforce, I stuck beside them.\r\n\r\nFirst to arrive was the Satyr, strangely unreal for all that he cast a\r\nshadow and tossed the dust with his hoofs. After him from the brake\r\ncame a monstrous lout, a thing of horse and rhinoceros, chewing a straw\r\nas it came; then appeared the Swine-woman and two Wolf-women; then the\r\nFox-bear witch, with her red eyes in her peaked red face, and then\r\nothers,—all hurrying eagerly. As they came forward they began to cringe\r\ntowards Moreau and chant, quite regardless of one another, fragments of\r\nthe latter half of the litany of the Law,—“His is the Hand that wounds;\r\nHis is the Hand that heals,” and so forth. As soon as they had\r\napproached within a distance of perhaps thirty yards they halted, and\r\nbowing on knees and elbows began flinging the white dust upon their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nImagine the scene if you can! We three blue-clad men, with our\r\nmisshapen black-faced attendant, standing in a wide expanse of sunlit\r\nyellow dust under the blazing blue sky, and surrounded by this circle\r\nof crouching and gesticulating monstrosities,—some almost human save in\r\ntheir subtle expression and gestures, some like cripples, some so\r\nstrangely distorted as to resemble nothing but the denizens of our\r\nwildest dreams; and, beyond, the reedy lines of a canebrake in one\r\ndirection, a dense tangle of palm-trees on the other, separating us\r\nfrom the ravine with the huts, and to the north the hazy horizon of the\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n“Sixty-two, sixty-three,” counted Moreau. “There are four more.”\r\n\r\n“I do not see the Leopard-man,” said I.\r\n\r\nPresently Moreau sounded the great horn again, and at the sound of it\r\nall the Beast People writhed and grovelled in the dust. Then, slinking\r\nout of the canebrake, stooping near the ground and trying to join the\r\ndust-throwing circle behind Moreau’s back, came the Leopard-man. The\r\nlast of the Beast People to arrive was the little Ape-man. The earlier\r\nanimals, hot and weary with their grovelling, shot vicious glances at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Cease!” said Moreau, in his firm, loud voice; and the Beast People sat\r\nback upon their hams and rested from their worshipping.\r\n\r\n“Where is the Sayer of the Law?” said Moreau, and the hairy-grey\r\nmonster bowed his face in the dust.\r\n\r\n“Say the words!” said Moreau.\r\n\r\nForthwith all in the kneeling assembly, swaying from side to side and\r\ndashing up the sulphur with their hands,—first the right hand and a\r\npuff of dust, and then the left,—began once more to chant their strange\r\nlitany. When they reached, “Not to eat Flesh or Fish, that is the Law,”\r\nMoreau held up his lank white hand.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” he cried, and there fell absolute silence upon them all.\r\n\r\nI think they all knew and dreaded what was coming. I looked round at\r\ntheir strange faces. When I saw their wincing attitudes and the furtive\r\ndread in their bright eyes, I wondered that I had ever believed them to\r\nbe men.\r\n\r\n“That Law has been broken!” said Moreau.\r\n\r\n“None escape,” from the faceless creature with the silvery hair. “None\r\nescape,” repeated the kneeling circle of Beast People.\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” cried Moreau, and looked round at their faces, cracking\r\nhis whip. I fancied the Hyena-swine looked dejected, so too did the\r\nLeopard-man. Moreau stopped, facing this creature, who cringed towards\r\nhim with the memory and dread of infinite torment.\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” repeated Moreau, in a voice of thunder.\r\n\r\n“Evil is he who breaks the Law,” chanted the Sayer of the Law.\r\n\r\nMoreau looked into the eyes of the Leopard-man, and seemed to be\r\ndragging the very soul out of the creature.\r\n\r\n“Who breaks the Law—” said Moreau, taking his eyes off his victim, and\r\nturning towards us (it seemed to me there was a touch of exultation in\r\nhis voice).\r\n\r\n“Goes back to the House of Pain,” they all clamoured,—“goes back to the\r\nHouse of Pain, O Master!”\r\n\r\n“Back to the House of Pain,—back to the House of Pain,” gabbled the\r\nApe-man, as though the idea was sweet to him.\r\n\r\n“Do you hear?” said Moreau, turning back to the criminal, “my\r\nfriend—Hullo!”\r\n\r\nFor the Leopard-man, released from Moreau’s eye, had risen straight\r\nfrom his knees, and now, with eyes aflame and his huge feline tusks\r\nflashing out from under his curling lips, leapt towards his tormentor.\r\nI am convinced that only the madness of unendurable fear could have\r\nprompted this attack. The whole circle of threescore monsters seemed to\r\nrise about us. I drew my revolver. The two figures collided. I saw\r\nMoreau reeling back from the Leopard-man’s blow. There was a furious\r\nyelling and howling all about us. Every one was moving rapidly. For a\r\nmoment I thought it was a general revolt. The furious face of the\r\nLeopard-man flashed by mine, with M’ling close in pursuit. I saw the\r\nyellow eyes of the Hyena-swine blazing with excitement, his attitude as\r\nif he were half resolved to attack me. The Satyr, too, glared at me\r\nover the Hyena-swine’s hunched shoulders. I heard the crack of Moreau’s\r\npistol, and saw the pink flash dart across the tumult. The whole crowd\r\nseemed to swing round in the direction of the glint of fire, and I too\r\nwas swung round by the magnetism of the movement. In another second I\r\nwas running, one of a tumultuous shouting crowd, in pursuit of the\r\nescaping Leopard-man.\r\n\r\nThat is all I can tell definitely. I saw the Leopard-man strike Moreau,\r\nand then everything spun about me until I was running headlong. M’ling\r\nwas ahead, close in pursuit of the fugitive. Behind, their tongues\r\nalready lolling out, ran the Wolf-women in great leaping strides. The\r\nSwine folk followed, squealing with excitement, and the two Bull-men in\r\ntheir swathings of white. Then came Moreau in a cluster of the Beast\r\nPeople, his wide-brimmed straw hat blown off, his revolver in hand, and\r\nhis lank white hair streaming out. The Hyena-swine ran beside me,\r\nkeeping pace with me and glancing furtively at me out of his feline\r\neyes, and the others came pattering and shouting behind us.\r\n\r\nThe Leopard-man went bursting his way through the long canes, which\r\nsprang back as he passed, and rattled in M’ling’s face. We others in\r\nthe rear found a trampled path for us when we reached the brake. The\r\nchase lay through the brake for perhaps a quarter of a mile, and then\r\nplunged into a dense thicket, which retarded our movements exceedingly,\r\nthough we went through it in a crowd together,—fronds flicking into our\r\nfaces, ropy creepers catching us under the chin or gripping our ankles,\r\nthorny plants hooking into and tearing cloth and flesh together.\r\n\r\n“He has gone on all-fours through this,” panted Moreau, now just ahead\r\nof me.\r\n\r\n“None escape,” said the Wolf-bear, laughing into my face with the\r\nexultation of hunting. We burst out again among rocks, and saw the\r\nquarry ahead running lightly on all-fours and snarling at us over his\r\nshoulder. At that the Wolf Folk howled with delight. The Thing was\r\nstill clothed, and at a distance its face still seemed human; but the\r\ncarriage of its four limbs was feline, and the furtive droop of its\r\nshoulder was distinctly that of a hunted animal. It leapt over some\r\nthorny yellow-flowering bushes, and was hidden. M’ling was halfway\r\nacross the space.\r\n\r\nMost of us now had lost the first speed of the chase, and had fallen\r\ninto a longer and steadier stride. I saw as we traversed the open that\r\nthe pursuit was now spreading from a column into a line. The\r\nHyena-swine still ran close to me, watching me as it ran, every now and\r\nthen puckering its muzzle with a snarling laugh. At the edge of the\r\nrocks the Leopard-man, realising that he was making for the projecting\r\ncape upon which he had stalked me on the night of my arrival, had\r\ndoubled in the undergrowth; but Montgomery had seen the manoeuvre, and\r\nturned him again. So, panting, tumbling against rocks, torn by\r\nbrambles, impeded by ferns and reeds, I helped to pursue the\r\nLeopard-man who had broken the Law, and the Hyena-swine ran, laughing\r\nsavagely, by my side. I staggered on, my head reeling and my heart\r\nbeating against my ribs, tired almost to death, and yet not daring to\r\nlose sight of the chase lest I should be left alone with this horrible\r\ncompanion. I staggered on in spite of infinite fatigue and the dense\r\nheat of the tropical afternoon.\r\n\r\nAt last the fury of the hunt slackened. We had pinned the wretched\r\nbrute into a corner of the island. Moreau, whip in hand, marshalled us\r\nall into an irregular line, and we advanced now slowly, shouting to one\r\nanother as we advanced and tightening the cordon about our victim. He\r\nlurked noiseless and invisible in the bushes through which I had run\r\nfrom him during that midnight pursuit.\r\n\r\n“Steady!” cried Moreau, “steady!” as the ends of the line crept round\r\nthe tangle of undergrowth and hemmed the brute in.\r\n\r\n“Ware a rush!” came the voice of Montgomery from beyond the thicket.\r\n\r\nI was on the slope above the bushes; Montgomery and Moreau beat along\r\nthe beach beneath. Slowly we pushed in among the fretted network of\r\nbranches and leaves. The quarry was silent.\r\n\r\n“Back to the House of Pain, the House of Pain, the House of Pain!”\r\nyelped the voice of the Ape-man, some twenty yards to the right.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard that, I forgave the poor wretch all the fear he had\r\ninspired in me. I heard the twigs snap and the boughs swish aside\r\nbefore the heavy tread of the Horse-rhinoceros upon my right. Then\r\nsuddenly through a polygon of green, in the half darkness under the\r\nluxuriant growth, I saw the creature we were hunting. I halted. He was\r\ncrouched together into the smallest possible compass, his luminous\r\ngreen eyes turned over his shoulder regarding me.\r\n\r\nIt may seem a strange contradiction in me,—I cannot explain the\r\nfact,—but now, seeing the creature there in a perfectly animal\r\nattitude, with the light gleaming in its eyes and its imperfectly human\r\nface distorted with terror, I realised again the fact of its humanity.\r\nIn another moment other of its pursuers would see it, and it would be\r\noverpowered and captured, to experience once more the horrible tortures\r\nof the enclosure. Abruptly I slipped out my revolver, aimed between its\r\nterror-struck eyes, and fired. As I did so, the Hyena-swine saw the\r\nThing, and flung itself upon it with an eager cry, thrusting thirsty\r\nteeth into its neck. All about me the green masses of the thicket were\r\nswaying and cracking as the Beast People came rushing together. One\r\nface and then another appeared.\r\n\r\n“Don’t kill it, Prendick!” cried Moreau. “Don’t kill it!” and I saw him\r\nstooping as he pushed through under the fronds of the big ferns.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he had beaten off the Hyena-swine with the handle of\r\nhis whip, and he and Montgomery were keeping away the excited\r\ncarnivorous Beast People, and particularly M’ling, from the still\r\nquivering body. The hairy-grey Thing came sniffing at the corpse under\r\nmy arm. The other animals, in their animal ardour, jostled me to get a\r\nnearer view.\r\n\r\n“Confound you, Prendick!” said Moreau. “I wanted him.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” said I, though I was not. “It was the impulse of the\r\nmoment.” I felt sick with exertion and excitement. Turning, I pushed my\r\nway out of the crowding Beast People and went on alone up the slope\r\ntowards the higher part of the headland. Under the shouted directions\r\nof Moreau I heard the three white-swathed Bull-men begin dragging the\r\nvictim down towards the water.\r\n\r\nIt was easy now for me to be alone. The Beast People manifested a quite\r\nhuman curiosity about the dead body, and followed it in a thick knot,\r\nsniffing and growling at it as the Bull-men dragged it down the beach.\r\nI went to the headland and watched the bull-men, black against the\r\nevening sky as they carried the weighted dead body out to sea; and like\r\na wave across my mind came the realisation of the unspeakable\r\naimlessness of things upon the island. Upon the beach among the rocks\r\nbeneath me were the Ape-man, the Hyena-swine, and several other of the\r\nBeast People, standing about Montgomery and Moreau. They were all still\r\nintensely excited, and all overflowing with noisy expressions of their\r\nloyalty to the Law; yet I felt an absolute assurance in my own mind\r\nthat the Hyena-swine was implicated in the rabbit-killing. A strange\r\npersuasion came upon me, that, save for the grossness of the line, the\r\ngrotesqueness of the forms, I had here before me the whole balance of\r\nhuman life in miniature, the whole interplay of instinct, reason, and\r\nfate in its simplest form. The Leopard-man had happened to go under:\r\nthat was all the difference. Poor brute!\r\n\r\nPoor brutes! I began to see the viler aspect of Moreau’s cruelty. I had\r\nnot thought before of the pain and trouble that came to these poor\r\nvictims after they had passed from Moreau’s hands. I had shivered only\r\nat the days of actual torment in the enclosure. But now that seemed to\r\nme the lesser part. Before, they had been beasts, their instincts fitly\r\nadapted to their surroundings, and happy as living things may be. Now\r\nthey stumbled in the shackles of humanity, lived in a fear that never\r\ndied, fretted by a law they could not understand; their mock-human\r\nexistence, begun in an agony, was one long internal struggle, one long\r\ndread of Moreau—and for what? It was the wantonness of it that stirred\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHad Moreau had any intelligible object, I could have sympathised at\r\nleast a little with him. I am not so squeamish about pain as that. I\r\ncould have forgiven him a little even, had his motive been only hate.\r\nBut he was so irresponsible, so utterly careless! His curiosity, his\r\nmad, aimless investigations, drove him on; and the Things were thrown\r\nout to live a year or so, to struggle and blunder and suffer, and at\r\nlast to die painfully. They were wretched in themselves; the old animal\r\nhate moved them to trouble one another; the Law held them back from a\r\nbrief hot struggle and a decisive end to their natural animosities.\r\n\r\nIn those days my fear of the Beast People went the way of my personal\r\nfear for Moreau. I fell indeed into a morbid state, deep and enduring,\r\nand alien to fear, which has left permanent scars upon my mind. I must\r\nconfess that I lost faith in the sanity of the world when I saw it\r\nsuffering the painful disorder of this island. A blind Fate, a vast\r\npitiless mechanism, seemed to cut and shape the fabric of existence and\r\nI, Moreau (by his passion for research), Montgomery (by his passion for\r\ndrink), the Beast People with their instincts and mental restrictions,\r\nwere torn and crushed, ruthlessly, inevitably, amid the infinite\r\ncomplexity of its incessant wheels. But this condition did not come all\r\nat once: I think indeed that I anticipate a little in speaking of it\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\nA CATASTROPHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely six weeks passed before I had lost every feeling but dislike\r\nand abhorrence for this infamous experiment of Moreau’s. My one idea\r\nwas to get away from these horrible caricatures of my Maker’s image,\r\nback to the sweet and wholesome intercourse of men. My\r\nfellow-creatures, from whom I was thus separated, began to assume\r\nidyllic virtue and beauty in my memory. My first friendship with\r\nMontgomery did not increase. His long separation from humanity, his\r\nsecret vice of drunkenness, his evident sympathy with the Beast People,\r\ntainted him to me. Several times I let him go alone among them. I\r\navoided intercourse with them in every possible way. I spent an\r\nincreasing proportion of my time upon the beach, looking for some\r\nliberating sail that never appeared,—until one day there fell upon us\r\nan appalling disaster, which put an altogether different aspect upon my\r\nstrange surroundings.\r\n\r\nIt was about seven or eight weeks after my landing,—rather more, I\r\nthink, though I had not troubled to keep account of the time,—when this\r\ncatastrophe occurred. It happened in the early morning—I should think\r\nabout six. I had risen and breakfasted early, having been aroused by\r\nthe noise of three Beast Men carrying wood into the enclosure.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I went to the open gateway of the enclosure, and stood\r\nthere smoking a cigarette and enjoying the freshness of the early\r\nmorning. Moreau presently came round the corner of the enclosure and\r\ngreeted me. He passed by me, and I heard him behind me unlock and enter\r\nhis laboratory. So indurated was I at that time to the abomination of\r\nthe place, that I heard without a touch of emotion the puma victim\r\nbegin another day of torture. It met its persecutor with a shriek,\r\nalmost exactly like that of an angry virago.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly something happened,—I do not know what, to this day. I\r\nheard a short, sharp cry behind me, a fall, and turning saw an awful\r\nface rushing upon me,—not human, not animal, but hellish, brown, seamed\r\nwith red branching scars, red drops starting out upon it, and the\r\nlidless eyes ablaze. I threw up my arm to defend myself from the blow\r\nthat flung me headlong with a broken forearm; and the great monster,\r\nswathed in lint and with red-stained bandages fluttering about it,\r\nleapt over me and passed. I rolled over and over down the beach, tried\r\nto sit up, and collapsed upon my broken arm. Then Moreau appeared, his\r\nmassive white face all the more terrible for the blood that trickled\r\nfrom his forehead. He carried a revolver in one hand. He scarcely\r\nglanced at me, but rushed off at once in pursuit of the puma.\r\n\r\nI tried the other arm and sat up. The muffled figure in front ran in\r\ngreat striding leaps along the beach, and Moreau followed her. She\r\nturned her head and saw him, then doubling abruptly made for the\r\nbushes. She gained upon him at every stride. I saw her plunge into\r\nthem, and Moreau, running slantingly to intercept her, fired and missed\r\nas she disappeared. Then he too vanished in the green confusion. I\r\nstared after them, and then the pain in my arm flamed up, and with a\r\ngroan I staggered to my feet. Montgomery appeared in the doorway,\r\ndressed, and with his revolver in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Great God, Prendick!” he said, not noticing that I was hurt, “that\r\nbrute’s loose! Tore the fetter out of the wall! Have you seen them?”\r\nThen sharply, seeing I gripped my arm, “What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“I was standing in the doorway,” said I.\r\n\r\nHe came forward and took my arm. “Blood on the sleeve,” said he, and\r\nrolled back the flannel. He pocketed his weapon, felt my arm about\r\npainfully, and led me inside. “Your arm is broken,” he said, and then,\r\n“Tell me exactly how it happened—what happened?”\r\n\r\nI told him what I had seen; told him in broken sentences, with gasps of\r\npain between them, and very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm\r\nmeanwhile. He slung it from my shoulder, stood back and looked at me.\r\n\r\n“You’ll do,” he said. “And now?”\r\n\r\nHe thought. Then he went out and locked the gates of the enclosure. He\r\nwas absent some time.\r\n\r\nI was chiefly concerned about my arm. The incident seemed merely one\r\nmore of many horrible things. I sat down in the deck chair, and I must\r\nadmit swore heartily at the island. The first dull feeling of injury in\r\nmy arm had already given way to a burning pain when Montgomery\r\nreappeared. His face was rather pale, and he showed more of his lower\r\ngums than ever.\r\n\r\n“I can neither see nor hear anything of him,” he said. “I’ve been\r\nthinking he may want my help.” He stared at me with his expressionless\r\neyes. “That was a strong brute,” he said. “It simply wrenched its\r\nfetter out of the wall.” He went to the window, then to the door, and\r\nthere turned to me. “I shall go after him,” he said. “There’s another\r\nrevolver I can leave with you. To tell you the truth, I feel anxious\r\nsomehow.”\r\n\r\nHe obtained the weapon, and put it ready to my hand on the table; then\r\nwent out, leaving a restless contagion in the air. I did not sit long\r\nafter he left, but took the revolver in hand and went to the doorway.\r\n\r\nThe morning was as still as death. Not a whisper of wind was stirring;\r\nthe sea was like polished glass, the sky empty, the beach desolate. In\r\nmy half-excited, half-feverish state, this stillness of things\r\noppressed me. I tried to whistle, and the tune died away. I swore\r\nagain,—the second time that morning. Then I went to the corner of the\r\nenclosure and stared inland at the green bush that had swallowed up\r\nMoreau and Montgomery. When would they return, and how? Then far away\r\nup the beach a little grey Beast Man appeared, ran down to the water’s\r\nedge and began splashing about. I strolled back to the doorway, then to\r\nthe corner again, and so began pacing to and fro like a sentinel upon\r\nduty. Once I was arrested by the distant voice of Montgomery bawling,\r\n“Coo-ee—Moreau!” My arm became less painful, but very hot. I got\r\nfeverish and thirsty. My shadow grew shorter. I watched the distant\r\nfigure until it went away again. Would Moreau and Montgomery never\r\nreturn? Three sea-birds began fighting for some stranded treasure.\r\n\r\nThen from far away behind the enclosure I heard a pistol-shot. A long\r\nsilence, and then came another. Then a yelling cry nearer, and another\r\ndismal gap of silence. My unfortunate imagination set to work to\r\ntorment me. Then suddenly a shot close by. I went to the corner,\r\nstartled, and saw Montgomery,—his face scarlet, his hair disordered,\r\nand the knee of his trousers torn. His face expressed profound\r\nconsternation. Behind him slouched the Beast Man, M’ling, and round\r\nM’ling’s jaws were some queer dark stains.\r\n\r\n“Has he come?” said Montgomery.\r\n\r\n“Moreau?” said I. “No.”\r\n\r\n“My God!” The man was panting, almost sobbing. “Go back in,” he said,\r\ntaking my arm. “They’re mad. They’re all rushing about mad. What can\r\nhave happened? I don’t know. I’ll tell you, when my breath comes.\r\nWhere’s some brandy?”\r\n\r\nMontgomery limped before me into the room and sat down in the deck\r\nchair. M’ling flung himself down just outside the doorway and began\r\npanting like a dog. I got Montgomery some brandy-and-water. He sat\r\nstaring in front of him at nothing, recovering his breath. After some\r\nminutes he began to tell me what had happened.\r\n\r\nHe had followed their track for some way. It was plain enough at first\r\non account of the crushed and broken bushes, white rags torn from the\r\npuma’s bandages, and occasional smears of blood on the leaves of the\r\nshrubs and undergrowth. He lost the track, however, on the stony ground\r\nbeyond the stream where I had seen the Beast Man drinking, and went\r\nwandering aimlessly westward shouting Moreau’s name. Then M’ling had\r\ncome to him carrying a light hatchet. M’ling had seen nothing of the\r\npuma affair; had been felling wood, and heard him calling. They went on\r\nshouting together. Two Beast Men came crouching and peering at them\r\nthrough the undergrowth, with gestures and a furtive carriage that\r\nalarmed Montgomery by their strangeness. He hailed them, and they fled\r\nguiltily. He stopped shouting after that, and after wandering some time\r\nfarther in an undecided way, determined to visit the huts.\r\n\r\nHe found the ravine deserted.\r\n\r\nGrowing more alarmed every minute, he began to retrace his steps. Then\r\nit was he encountered the two Swine-men I had seen dancing on the night\r\nof my arrival; blood-stained they were about the mouth, and intensely\r\nexcited. They came crashing through the ferns, and stopped with fierce\r\nfaces when they saw him. He cracked his whip in some trepidation, and\r\nforthwith they rushed at him. Never before had a Beast Man dared to do\r\nthat. One he shot through the head; M’ling flung himself upon the\r\nother, and the two rolled grappling. M’ling got his brute under and\r\nwith his teeth in its throat, and Montgomery shot that too as it\r\nstruggled in M’ling’s grip. He had some difficulty in inducing M’ling\r\nto come on with him. Thence they had hurried back to me. On the way,\r\nM’ling had suddenly rushed into a thicket and driven out an under-sized\r\nOcelot-man, also blood-stained, and lame through a wound in the foot.\r\nThis brute had run a little way and then turned savagely at bay, and\r\nMontgomery—with a certain wantonness, I thought—had shot him.\r\n\r\n“What does it all mean?” said I.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and turned once more to the brandy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\nTHE FINDING OF MOREAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Montgomery swallow a third dose of brandy, I took it upon\r\nmyself to interfere. He was already more than half fuddled. I told him\r\nthat some serious thing must have happened to Moreau by this time, or\r\nhe would have returned before this, and that it behoved us to ascertain\r\nwhat that catastrophe was. Montgomery raised some feeble objections,\r\nand at last agreed. We had some food, and then all three of us started.\r\n\r\nIt is possibly due to the tension of my mind, at the time, but even now\r\nthat start into the hot stillness of the tropical afternoon is a\r\nsingularly vivid impression. M’ling went first, his shoulder hunched,\r\nhis strange black head moving with quick starts as he peered first on\r\nthis side of the way and then on that. He was unarmed; his axe he had\r\ndropped when he encountered the Swine-man. Teeth were _his_ weapons,\r\nwhen it came to fighting. Montgomery followed with stumbling footsteps,\r\nhis hands in his pockets, his face downcast; he was in a state of\r\nmuddled sullenness with me on account of the brandy. My left arm was in\r\na sling (it was lucky it was my left), and I carried my revolver in my\r\nright. Soon we traced a narrow path through the wild luxuriance of the\r\nisland, going northwestward; and presently M’ling stopped, and became\r\nrigid with watchfulness. Montgomery almost staggered into him, and then\r\nstopped too. Then, listening intently, we heard coming through the\r\ntrees the sound of voices and footsteps approaching us.\r\n\r\n“He is dead,” said a deep, vibrating voice.\r\n\r\n“He is not dead; he is not dead,” jabbered another.\r\n\r\n“We saw, we saw,” said several voices.\r\n\r\n“_Hul_-lo!” suddenly shouted Montgomery, “Hullo, there!”\r\n\r\n“Confound you!” said I, and gripped my pistol.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, then a crashing among the interlacing vegetation,\r\nfirst here, then there, and then half-a-dozen faces appeared,—strange\r\nfaces, lit by a strange light. M’ling made a growling noise in his\r\nthroat. I recognised the Ape-man: I had indeed already identified his\r\nvoice, and two of the white-swathed brown-featured creatures I had seen\r\nin Montgomery’s boat. With these were the two dappled brutes and that\r\ngrey, horribly crooked creature who said the Law, with grey hair\r\nstreaming down its cheeks, heavy grey eyebrows, and grey locks pouring\r\noff from a central parting upon its sloping forehead,—a heavy, faceless\r\nthing, with strange red eyes, looking at us curiously from amidst the\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nFor a space no one spoke. Then Montgomery hiccoughed, “Who—said he was\r\ndead?”\r\n\r\nThe Monkey-man looked guiltily at the hairy-grey Thing. “He is dead,”\r\nsaid this monster. “They saw.”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing threatening about this detachment, at any rate. They\r\nseemed awestricken and puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Where is he?” said Montgomery.\r\n\r\n“Beyond,” and the grey creature pointed.\r\n\r\n“Is there a Law now?” asked the Monkey-man. “Is it still to be this and\r\nthat? Is he dead indeed?”\r\n\r\n“Is there a Law?” repeated the man in white. “Is there a Law, thou\r\nOther with the Whip?”\r\n\r\n“He is dead,” said the hairy-grey Thing. And they all stood watching\r\nus.\r\n\r\n“Prendick,” said Montgomery, turning his dull eyes to me. “He’s dead,\r\nevidently.”\r\n\r\nI had been standing behind him during this colloquy. I began to see how\r\nthings lay with them. I suddenly stepped in front of Montgomery and\r\nlifted up my voice:—“Children of the Law,” I said, “he is _not_ dead!”\r\nM’ling turned his sharp eyes on me. “He has changed his shape; he has\r\nchanged his body,” I went on. “For a time you will not see him. He\r\nis—there,” I pointed upward, “where he can watch you. You cannot see\r\nhim, but he can see you. Fear the Law!”\r\n\r\nI looked at them squarely. They flinched.\r\n\r\n“He is great, he is good,” said the Ape-man, peering fearfully upward\r\namong the dense trees.\r\n\r\n“And the other Thing?” I demanded.\r\n\r\n“The Thing that bled, and ran screaming and sobbing,—that is dead too,”\r\nsaid the grey Thing, still regarding me.\r\n\r\n“That’s well,” grunted Montgomery.\r\n\r\n“The Other with the Whip—” began the grey Thing.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Said he was dead.”\r\n\r\nBut Montgomery was still sober enough to understand my motive in\r\ndenying Moreau’s death. “He is not dead,” he said slowly, “not dead at\r\nall. No more dead than I am.”\r\n\r\n“Some,” said I, “have broken the Law: they will die. Some have died.\r\nShow us now where his old body lies,—the body he cast away because he\r\nhad no more need of it.”\r\n\r\n“It is this way, Man who walked in the Sea,” said the grey Thing.\r\n\r\nAnd with these six creatures guiding us, we went through the tumult of\r\nferns and creepers and tree-stems towards the northwest. Then came a\r\nyelling, a crashing among the branches, and a little pink homunculus\r\nrushed by us shrieking. Immediately after appeared a monster in\r\nheadlong pursuit, blood-bedabbled, who was amongst us almost before he\r\ncould stop his career. The grey Thing leapt aside. M’ling, with a\r\nsnarl, flew at it, and was struck aside. Montgomery fired and missed,\r\nbowed his head, threw up his arm, and turned to run. I fired, and the\r\nThing still came on; fired again, point-blank, into its ugly face. I\r\nsaw its features vanish in a flash: its face was driven in. Yet it\r\npassed me, gripped Montgomery, and holding him, fell headlong beside\r\nhim and pulled him sprawling upon itself in its death-agony.\r\n\r\nI found myself alone with M’ling, the dead brute, and the prostrate\r\nman. Montgomery raised himself slowly and stared in a muddled way at\r\nthe shattered Beast Man beside him. It more than half sobered him. He\r\nscrambled to his feet. Then I saw the grey Thing returning cautiously\r\nthrough the trees.\r\n\r\n“See,” said I, pointing to the dead brute, “is the Law not alive? This\r\ncame of breaking the Law.”\r\n\r\nHe peered at the body. “He sends the Fire that kills,” said he, in his\r\ndeep voice, repeating part of the Ritual. The others gathered round and\r\nstared for a space.\r\n\r\nAt last we drew near the westward extremity of the island. We came upon\r\nthe gnawed and mutilated body of the puma, its shoulder-bone smashed by\r\na bullet, and perhaps twenty yards farther found at last what we\r\nsought. Moreau lay face downward in a trampled space in a canebrake.\r\nOne hand was almost severed at the wrist and his silvery hair was\r\ndabbled in blood. His head had been battered in by the fetters of the\r\npuma. The broken canes beneath him were smeared with blood. His\r\nrevolver we could not find. Montgomery turned him over. Resting at\r\nintervals, and with the help of the seven Beast People (for he was a\r\nheavy man), we carried Moreau back to the enclosure. The night was\r\ndarkling. Twice we heard unseen creatures howling and shrieking past\r\nour little band, and once the little pink sloth-creature appeared and\r\nstared at us, and vanished again. But we were not attacked again. At\r\nthe gates of the enclosure our company of Beast People left us, M’ling\r\ngoing with the rest. We locked ourselves in, and then took Moreau’s\r\nmangled body into the yard and laid it upon a pile of brushwood. Then\r\nwe went into the laboratory and put an end to all we found living\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\nMONTGOMERY’S “BANK HOLIDAY.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this was accomplished, and we had washed and eaten, Montgomery and\r\nI went into my little room and seriously discussed our position for the\r\nfirst time. It was then near midnight. He was almost sober, but greatly\r\ndisturbed in his mind. He had been strangely under the influence of\r\nMoreau’s personality: I do not think it had ever occurred to him that\r\nMoreau could die. This disaster was the sudden collapse of the habits\r\nthat had become part of his nature in the ten or more monotonous years\r\nhe had spent on the island. He talked vaguely, answered my questions\r\ncrookedly, wandered into general questions.\r\n\r\n“This silly ass of a world,” he said; “what a muddle it all is! I\r\nhaven’t had any life. I wonder when it’s going to begin. Sixteen years\r\nbeing bullied by nurses and schoolmasters at their own sweet will; five\r\nin London grinding hard at medicine, bad food, shabby lodgings, shabby\r\nclothes, shabby vice, a blunder,—_I_ didn’t know any better,—and\r\nhustled off to this beastly island. Ten years here! What’s it all for,\r\nPrendick? Are we bubbles blown by a baby?”\r\n\r\nIt was hard to deal with such ravings. “The thing we have to think of\r\nnow,” said I, “is how to get away from this island.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the good of getting away? I’m an outcast. Where am _I_ to join\r\non? It’s all very well for _you_, Prendick. Poor old Moreau! We can’t\r\nleave him here to have his bones picked. As it is—And besides, what\r\nwill become of the decent part of the Beast Folk?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, “that will do to-morrow. I’ve been thinking we might\r\nmake the brushwood into a pyre and burn his body—and those other\r\nthings. Then what will happen with the Beast Folk?”\r\n\r\n“_I_ don’t know. I suppose those that were made of beasts of prey will\r\nmake silly asses of themselves sooner or later. We can’t massacre the\r\nlot—can we? I suppose that’s what _your_ humanity would suggest? But\r\nthey’ll change. They are sure to change.”\r\n\r\nHe talked thus inconclusively until at last I felt my temper going.\r\n\r\n“Damnation!” he exclaimed at some petulance of mine; “can’t you see I’m\r\nin a worse hole than you are?” And he got up, and went for the brandy.\r\n“Drink!” he said returning, “you logic-chopping, chalky-faced saint of\r\nan atheist, drink!”\r\n\r\n“Not I,” said I, and sat grimly watching his face under the yellow\r\nparaffine flare, as he drank himself into a garrulous misery.\r\n\r\nI have a memory of infinite tedium. He wandered into a maudlin defence\r\nof the Beast People and of M’ling. M’ling, he said, was the only thing\r\nthat had ever really cared for him. And suddenly an idea came to him.\r\n\r\n“I’m damned!” said he, staggering to his feet and clutching the brandy\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\nBy some flash of intuition I knew what it was he intended. “You don’t\r\ngive drink to that beast!” I said, rising and facing him.\r\n\r\n“Beast!” said he. “You’re the beast. He takes his liquor like a\r\nChristian. Come out of the way, Prendick!”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Get—out of the way!” he roared, and suddenly whipped out his revolver.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said I, and stood aside, half-minded to fall upon him as\r\nhe put his hand upon the latch, but deterred by the thought of my\r\nuseless arm. “You’ve made a beast of yourself,—to the beasts you may\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\nHe flung the doorway open, and stood half facing me between the yellow\r\nlamp-light and the pallid glare of the moon; his eye-sockets were\r\nblotches of black under his stubbly eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“You’re a solemn prig, Prendick, a silly ass! You’re always fearing and\r\nfancying. We’re on the edge of things. I’m bound to cut my throat\r\nto-morrow. I’m going to have a damned Bank Holiday to-night.” He turned\r\nand went out into the moonlight. “M’ling!” he cried; “M’ling, old\r\nfriend!”\r\n\r\nThree dim creatures in the silvery light came along the edge of the wan\r\nbeach,—one a white-wrapped creature, the other two blotches of\r\nblackness following it. They halted, staring. Then I saw M’ling’s\r\nhunched shoulders as he came round the corner of the house.\r\n\r\n“Drink!” cried Montgomery, “drink, you brutes! Drink and be men! Damme,\r\nI’m the cleverest. Moreau forgot this; this is the last touch. Drink, I\r\ntell you!” And waving the bottle in his hand he started off at a kind\r\nof quick trot to the westward, M’ling ranging himself between him and\r\nthe three dim creatures who followed.\r\n\r\nI went to the doorway. They were already indistinct in the mist of the\r\nmoonlight before Montgomery halted. I saw him administer a dose of the\r\nraw brandy to M’ling, and saw the five figures melt into one vague\r\npatch.\r\n\r\n“Sing!” I heard Montgomery shout,—“sing all together, ‘Confound old\r\nPrendick!’ That’s right; now again, ‘Confound old Prendick!’”\r\n\r\nThe black group broke up into five separate figures, and wound slowly\r\naway from me along the band of shining beach. Each went howling at his\r\nown sweet will, yelping insults at me, or giving whatever other vent\r\nthis new inspiration of brandy demanded. Presently I heard Montgomery’s\r\nvoice shouting, “Right turn!” and they passed with their shouts and\r\nhowls into the blackness of the landward trees. Slowly, very slowly,\r\nthey receded into silence.\r\n\r\nThe peaceful splendour of the night healed again. The moon was now past\r\nthe meridian and travelling down the west. It was at its full, and very\r\nbright riding through the empty blue sky. The shadow of the wall lay, a\r\nyard wide and of inky blackness, at my feet. The eastward sea was a\r\nfeatureless grey, dark and mysterious; and between the sea and the\r\nshadow the grey sands (of volcanic glass and crystals) flashed and\r\nshone like a beach of diamonds. Behind me the paraffine lamp flared hot\r\nand ruddy.\r\n\r\nThen I shut the door, locked it, and went into the enclosure where\r\nMoreau lay beside his latest victims,—the staghounds and the llama and\r\nsome other wretched brutes,—with his massive face calm even after his\r\nterrible death, and with the hard eyes open, staring at the dead white\r\nmoon above. I sat down upon the edge of the sink, and with my eyes upon\r\nthat ghastly pile of silvery light and ominous shadows began to turn\r\nover my plans. In the morning I would gather some provisions in the\r\ndingey, and after setting fire to the pyre before me, push out into the\r\ndesolation of the high sea once more. I felt that for Montgomery there\r\nwas no help; that he was, in truth, half akin to these Beast Folk,\r\nunfitted for human kindred.\r\n\r\nI do not know how long I sat there scheming. It must have been an hour\r\nor so. Then my planning was interrupted by the return of Montgomery to\r\nmy neighbourhood. I heard a yelling from many throats, a tumult of\r\nexultant cries passing down towards the beach, whooping and howling,\r\nand excited shrieks that seemed to come to a stop near the water’s\r\nedge. The riot rose and fell; I heard heavy blows and the splintering\r\nsmash of wood, but it did not trouble me then. A discordant chanting\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts went back to my means of escape. I got up, brought the\r\nlamp, and went into a shed to look at some kegs I had seen there. Then\r\nI became interested in the contents of some biscuit-tins, and opened\r\none. I saw something out of the tail of my eye,—a red figure,—and\r\nturned sharply.\r\n\r\nBehind me lay the yard, vividly black-and-white in the moonlight, and\r\nthe pile of wood and faggots on which Moreau and his mutilated victims\r\nlay, one over another. They seemed to be gripping one another in one\r\nlast revengeful grapple. His wounds gaped, black as night, and the\r\nblood that had dripped lay in black patches upon the sand. Then I saw,\r\nwithout understanding, the cause of my phantom,—a ruddy glow that came\r\nand danced and went upon the wall opposite. I misinterpreted this,\r\nfancied it was a reflection of my flickering lamp, and turned again to\r\nthe stores in the shed. I went on rummaging among them, as well as a\r\none-armed man could, finding this convenient thing and that, and\r\nputting them aside for to-morrow’s launch. My movements were slow, and\r\nthe time passed quickly. Insensibly the daylight crept upon me.\r\n\r\nThe chanting died down, giving place to a clamour; then it began again,\r\nand suddenly broke into a tumult. I heard cries of, “More! more!” a\r\nsound like quarrelling, and a sudden wild shriek. The quality of the\r\nsounds changed so greatly that it arrested my attention. I went out\r\ninto the yard and listened. Then cutting like a knife across the\r\nconfusion came the crack of a revolver.\r\n\r\nI rushed at once through my room to the little doorway. As I did so I\r\nheard some of the packing-cases behind me go sliding down and smash\r\ntogether with a clatter of glass on the floor of the shed. But I did\r\nnot heed these. I flung the door open and looked out.\r\n\r\nUp the beach by the boathouse a bonfire was burning, raining up sparks\r\ninto the indistinctness of the dawn. Around this struggled a mass of\r\nblack figures. I heard Montgomery call my name. I began to run at once\r\ntowards this fire, revolver in hand. I saw the pink tongue of\r\nMontgomery’s pistol lick out once, close to the ground. He was down. I\r\nshouted with all my strength and fired into the air. I heard some one\r\ncry, “The Master!” The knotted black struggle broke into scattering\r\nunits, the fire leapt and sank down. The crowd of Beast People fled in\r\nsudden panic before me, up the beach. In my excitement I fired at their\r\nretreating backs as they disappeared among the bushes. Then I turned to\r\nthe black heaps upon the ground.\r\n\r\nMontgomery lay on his back, with the hairy-grey Beast-man sprawling\r\nacross his body. The brute was dead, but still gripping Montgomery’s\r\nthroat with its curving claws. Near by lay M’ling on his face and quite\r\nstill, his neck bitten open and the upper part of the smashed\r\nbrandy-bottle in his hand. Two other figures lay near the fire,—the one\r\nmotionless, the other groaning fitfully, every now and then raising its\r\nhead slowly, then dropping it again.\r\n\r\nI caught hold of the grey man and pulled him off Montgomery’s body; his\r\nclaws drew down the torn coat reluctantly as I dragged him away.\r\nMontgomery was dark in the face and scarcely breathing. I splashed\r\nsea-water on his face and pillowed his head on my rolled-up coat.\r\nM’ling was dead. The wounded creature by the fire—it was a Wolf-brute\r\nwith a bearded grey face—lay, I found, with the fore part of its body\r\nupon the still glowing timber. The wretched thing was injured so\r\ndreadfully that in mercy I blew its brains out at once. The other brute\r\nwas one of the Bull-men swathed in white. He too was dead. The rest of\r\nthe Beast People had vanished from the beach.\r\n\r\nI went to Montgomery again and knelt beside him, cursing my ignorance\r\nof medicine. The fire beside me had sunk down, and only charred beams\r\nof timber glowing at the central ends and mixed with a grey ash of\r\nbrushwood remained. I wondered casually where Montgomery had got his\r\nwood. Then I saw that the dawn was upon us. The sky had grown brighter,\r\nthe setting moon was becoming pale and opaque in the luminous blue of\r\nthe day. The sky to the eastward was rimmed with red.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard a thud and a hissing behind me, and, looking round,\r\nsprang to my feet with a cry of horror. Against the warm dawn great\r\ntumultuous masses of black smoke were boiling up out of the enclosure,\r\nand through their stormy darkness shot flickering threads of blood-red\r\nflame. Then the thatched roof caught. I saw the curving charge of the\r\nflames across the sloping straw. A spurt of fire jetted from the window\r\nof my room.\r\n\r\nI knew at once what had happened. I remembered the crash I had heard.\r\nWhen I had rushed out to Montgomery’s assistance, I had overturned the\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\nThe hopelessness of saving any of the contents of the enclosure stared\r\nme in the face. My mind came back to my plan of flight, and turning\r\nswiftly I looked to see where the two boats lay upon the beach. They\r\nwere gone! Two axes lay upon the sands beside me; chips and splinters\r\nwere scattered broadcast, and the ashes of the bonfire were blackening\r\nand smoking under the dawn. Montgomery had burnt the boats to revenge\r\nhimself upon me and prevent our return to mankind!\r\n\r\nA sudden convulsion of rage shook me. I was almost moved to batter his\r\nfoolish head in, as he lay there helpless at my feet. Then suddenly his\r\nhand moved, so feebly, so pitifully, that my wrath vanished. He\r\ngroaned, and opened his eyes for a minute. I knelt down beside him and\r\nraised his head. He opened his eyes again, staring silently at the\r\ndawn, and then they met mine. The lids fell.\r\n\r\n“Sorry,” he said presently, with an effort. He seemed trying to think.\r\n“The last,” he murmured, “the last of this silly universe. What a\r\nmess—”\r\n\r\nI listened. His head fell helplessly to one side. I thought some drink\r\nmight revive him; but there was neither drink nor vessel in which to\r\nbring drink at hand. He seemed suddenly heavier. My heart went cold. I\r\nbent down to his face, put my hand through the rent in his blouse. He\r\nwas dead; and even as he died a line of white heat, the limb of the\r\nsun, rose eastward beyond the projection of the bay, splashing its\r\nradiance across the sky and turning the dark sea into a weltering\r\ntumult of dazzling light. It fell like a glory upon his death-shrunken\r\nface.\r\n\r\nI let his head fall gently upon the rough pillow I had made for him,\r\nand stood up. Before me was the glittering desolation of the sea, the\r\nawful solitude upon which I had already suffered so much; behind me the\r\nisland, hushed under the dawn, its Beast People silent and unseen. The\r\nenclosure, with all its provisions and ammunition, burnt noisily, with\r\nsudden gusts of flame, a fitful crackling, and now and then a crash.\r\nThe heavy smoke drove up the beach away from me, rolling low over the\r\ndistant tree-tops towards the huts in the ravine. Beside me were the\r\ncharred vestiges of the boats and these five dead bodies.\r\n\r\nThen out of the bushes came three Beast People, with hunched shoulders,\r\nprotruding heads, misshapen hands awkwardly held, and inquisitive,\r\nunfriendly eyes, and advanced towards me with hesitating gestures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\nALONE WITH THE BEAST FOLK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI faced these people, facing my fate in them, single-handed\r\nnow,—literally single-handed, for I had a broken arm. In my pocket was\r\na revolver with two empty chambers. Among the chips scattered about the\r\nbeach lay the two axes that had been used to chop up the boats. The\r\ntide was creeping in behind me. There was nothing for it but courage. I\r\nlooked squarely into the faces of the advancing monsters. They avoided\r\nmy eyes, and their quivering nostrils investigated the bodies that lay\r\nbeyond me on the beach. I took half-a-dozen steps, picked up the\r\nblood-stained whip that lay beneath the body of the Wolf-man, and\r\ncracked it. They stopped and stared at me.\r\n\r\n“Salute!” said I. “Bow down!”\r\n\r\nThey hesitated. One bent his knees. I repeated my command, with my\r\nheart in my mouth, and advanced upon them. One knelt, then the other\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nI turned and walked towards the dead bodies, keeping my face towards\r\nthe three kneeling Beast Men, very much as an actor passing up the\r\nstage faces the audience.\r\n\r\n“They broke the Law,” said I, putting my foot on the Sayer of the Law.\r\n“They have been slain,—even the Sayer of the Law; even the Other with\r\nthe Whip. Great is the Law! Come and see.”\r\n\r\n“None escape,” said one of them, advancing and peering.\r\n\r\n“None escape,” said I. “Therefore hear and do as I command.” They stood\r\nup, looking questioningly at one another.\r\n\r\n“Stand there,” said I.\r\n\r\nI picked up the hatchets and swung them by their heads from the sling\r\nof my arm; turned Montgomery over; picked up his revolver still loaded\r\nin two chambers, and bending down to rummage, found half-a-dozen\r\ncartridges in his pocket.\r\n\r\n“Take him,” said I, standing up again and pointing with the whip; “take\r\nhim, and carry him out and cast him into the sea.”\r\n\r\nThey came forward, evidently still afraid of Montgomery, but still more\r\nafraid of my cracking red whip-lash; and after some fumbling and\r\nhesitation, some whip-cracking and shouting, they lifted him gingerly,\r\ncarried him down to the beach, and went splashing into the dazzling\r\nwelter of the sea.\r\n\r\n“On!” said I, “on! Carry him far.”\r\n\r\nThey went in up to their armpits and stood regarding me.\r\n\r\n“Let go,” said I; and the body of Montgomery vanished with a splash.\r\nSomething seemed to tighten across my chest.\r\n\r\n“Good!” said I, with a break in my voice; and they came back, hurrying\r\nand fearful, to the margin of the water, leaving long wakes of black in\r\nthe silver. At the water’s edge they stopped, turning and glaring into\r\nthe sea as though they presently expected Montgomery to arise therefrom\r\nand exact vengeance.\r\n\r\n“Now these,” said I, pointing to the other bodies.\r\n\r\nThey took care not to approach the place where they had thrown\r\nMontgomery into the water, but instead, carried the four dead Beast\r\nPeople slantingly along the beach for perhaps a hundred yards before\r\nthey waded out and cast them away.\r\n\r\nAs I watched them disposing of the mangled remains of M’ling, I heard a\r\nlight footfall behind me, and turning quickly saw the big Hyena-swine\r\nperhaps a dozen yards away. His head was bent down, his bright eyes\r\nwere fixed upon me, his stumpy hands clenched and held close by his\r\nside. He stopped in this crouching attitude when I turned, his eyes a\r\nlittle averted.\r\n\r\nFor a moment we stood eye to eye. I dropped the whip and snatched at\r\nthe pistol in my pocket; for I meant to kill this brute, the most\r\nformidable of any left now upon the island, at the first excuse. It may\r\nseem treacherous, but so I was resolved. I was far more afraid of him\r\nthan of any other two of the Beast Folk. His continued life was I knew\r\na threat against mine.\r\n\r\nI was perhaps a dozen seconds collecting myself. Then cried I, “Salute!\r\nBow down!”\r\n\r\nHis teeth flashed upon me in a snarl. “Who are _you_ that I should—”\r\n\r\nPerhaps a little too spasmodically I drew my revolver, aimed quickly\r\nand fired. I heard him yelp, saw him run sideways and turn, knew I had\r\nmissed, and clicked back the cock with my thumb for the next shot. But\r\nhe was already running headlong, jumping from side to side, and I dared\r\nnot risk another miss. Every now and then he looked back at me over his\r\nshoulder. He went slanting along the beach, and vanished beneath the\r\ndriving masses of dense smoke that were still pouring out from the\r\nburning enclosure. For some time I stood staring after him. I turned to\r\nmy three obedient Beast Folk again and signalled them to drop the body\r\nthey still carried. Then I went back to the place by the fire where the\r\nbodies had fallen and kicked the sand until all the brown blood-stains\r\nwere absorbed and hidden.\r\n\r\nI dismissed my three serfs with a wave of the hand, and went up the\r\nbeach into the thickets. I carried my pistol in my hand, my whip thrust\r\nwith the hatchets in the sling of my arm. I was anxious to be alone, to\r\nthink out the position in which I was now placed. A dreadful thing that\r\nI was only beginning to realise was, that over all this island there\r\nwas now no safe place where I could be alone and secure to rest or\r\nsleep. I had recovered strength amazingly since my landing, but I was\r\nstill inclined to be nervous and to break down under any great stress.\r\nI felt that I ought to cross the island and establish myself with the\r\nBeast People, and make myself secure in their confidence. But my heart\r\nfailed me. I went back to the beach, and turning eastward past the\r\nburning enclosure, made for a point where a shallow spit of coral sand\r\nran out towards the reef. Here I could sit down and think, my back to\r\nthe sea and my face against any surprise. And there I sat, chin on\r\nknees, the sun beating down upon my head and unspeakable dread in my\r\nmind, plotting how I could live on against the hour of my rescue (if\r\never rescue came). I tried to review the whole situation as calmly as I\r\ncould, but it was difficult to clear the thing of emotion.\r\n\r\nI began turning over in my mind the reason of Montgomery’s despair.\r\n“They will change,” he said; “they are sure to change.” And Moreau,\r\nwhat was it that Moreau had said? “The stubborn beast-flesh grows day\r\nby day back again.” Then I came round to the Hyena-swine. I felt sure\r\nthat if I did not kill that brute, he would kill me. The Sayer of the\r\nLaw was dead: worse luck. They knew now that we of the Whips could be\r\nkilled even as they themselves were killed. Were they peering at me\r\nalready out of the green masses of ferns and palms over yonder,\r\nwatching until I came within their spring? Were they plotting against\r\nme? What was the Hyena-swine telling them? My imagination was running\r\naway with me into a morass of unsubstantial fears.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts were disturbed by a crying of sea-birds hurrying towards\r\nsome black object that had been stranded by the waves on the beach near\r\nthe enclosure. I knew what that object was, but I had not the heart to\r\ngo back and drive them off. I began walking along the beach in the\r\nopposite direction, designing to come round the eastward corner of the\r\nisland and so approach the ravine of the huts, without traversing the\r\npossible ambuscades of the thickets.\r\n\r\nPerhaps half a mile along the beach I became aware of one of my three\r\nBeast Folk advancing out of the landward bushes towards me. I was now\r\nso nervous with my own imaginings that I immediately drew my revolver.\r\nEven the propitiatory gestures of the creature failed to disarm me. He\r\nhesitated as he approached.\r\n\r\n“Go away!” cried I.\r\n\r\nThere was something very suggestive of a dog in the cringing attitude\r\nof the creature. It retreated a little way, very like a dog being sent\r\nhome, and stopped, looking at me imploringly with canine brown eyes.\r\n\r\n“Go away,” said I. “Do not come near me.”\r\n\r\n“May I not come near you?” it said.\r\n\r\n“No; go away,” I insisted, and snapped my whip. Then putting my whip in\r\nmy teeth, I stooped for a stone, and with that threat drove the\r\ncreature away.\r\n\r\nSo in solitude I came round by the ravine of the Beast People, and\r\nhiding among the weeds and reeds that separated this crevice from the\r\nsea I watched such of them as appeared, trying to judge from their\r\ngestures and appearance how the death of Moreau and Montgomery and the\r\ndestruction of the House of Pain had affected them. I know now the\r\nfolly of my cowardice. Had I kept my courage up to the level of the\r\ndawn, had I not allowed it to ebb away in solitary thought, I might\r\nhave grasped the vacant sceptre of Moreau and ruled over the Beast\r\nPeople. As it was I lost the opportunity, and sank to the position of a\r\nmere leader among my fellows.\r\n\r\nTowards noon certain of them came and squatted basking in the hot sand.\r\nThe imperious voices of hunger and thirst prevailed over my dread. I\r\ncame out of the bushes, and, revolver in hand, walked down towards\r\nthese seated figures. One, a Wolf-woman, turned her head and stared at\r\nme, and then the others. None attempted to rise or salute me. I felt\r\ntoo faint and weary to insist, and I let the moment pass.\r\n\r\n“I want food,” said I, almost apologetically, and drawing near.\r\n\r\n“There is food in the huts,” said an Ox-boar-man, drowsily, and looking\r\naway from me.\r\n\r\nI passed them, and went down into the shadow and odours of the almost\r\ndeserted ravine. In an empty hut I feasted on some specked and\r\nhalf-decayed fruit; and then after I had propped some branches and\r\nsticks about the opening, and placed myself with my face towards it and\r\nmy hand upon my revolver, the exhaustion of the last thirty hours\r\nclaimed its own, and I fell into a light slumber, hoping that the\r\nflimsy barricade I had erected would cause sufficient noise in its\r\nremoval to save me from surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\nTHE REVERSION OF THE BEAST FOLK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way I became one among the Beast People in the Island of Doctor\r\nMoreau. When I awoke, it was dark about me. My arm ached in its\r\nbandages. I sat up, wondering at first where I might be. I heard coarse\r\nvoices talking outside. Then I saw that my barricade had gone, and that\r\nthe opening of the hut stood clear. My revolver was still in my hand.\r\n\r\nI heard something breathing, saw something crouched together close\r\nbeside me. I held my breath, trying to see what it was. It began to\r\nmove slowly, interminably. Then something soft and warm and moist\r\npassed across my hand. All my muscles contracted. I snatched my hand\r\naway. A cry of alarm began and was stifled in my throat. Then I just\r\nrealised what had happened sufficiently to stay my fingers on the\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\n“Who is that?” I said in a hoarse whisper, the revolver still pointed.\r\n\r\n“_I_—Master.”\r\n\r\n“Who are _you?_”\r\n\r\n“They say there is no Master now. But I know, I know. I carried the\r\nbodies into the sea, O Walker in the Sea! the bodies of those you slew.\r\nI am your slave, Master.”\r\n\r\n“Are you the one I met on the beach?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The same, Master.”\r\n\r\nThe Thing was evidently faithful enough, for it might have fallen upon\r\nme as I slept. “It is well,” I said, extending my hand for another\r\nlicking kiss. I began to realise what its presence meant, and the tide\r\nof my courage flowed. “Where are the others?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“They are mad; they are fools,” said the Dog-man. “Even now they talk\r\ntogether beyond there. They say, ‘The Master is dead. The Other with\r\nthe Whip is dead. That Other who walked in the Sea is as we are. We\r\nhave no Master, no Whips, no House of Pain, any more. There is an end.\r\nWe love the Law, and will keep it; but there is no Pain, no Master, no\r\nWhips for ever again.’ So they say. But I know, Master, I know.”\r\n\r\nI felt in the darkness, and patted the Dog-man’s head. “It is well,” I\r\nsaid again.\r\n\r\n“Presently you will slay them all,” said the Dog-man.\r\n\r\n“Presently,” I answered, “I will slay them all,—after certain days and\r\ncertain things have come to pass. Every one of them save those you\r\nspare, every one of them shall be slain.”\r\n\r\n“What the Master wishes to kill, the Master kills,” said the Dog-man\r\nwith a certain satisfaction in his voice.\r\n\r\n“And that their sins may grow,” I said, “let them live in their folly\r\nuntil their time is ripe. Let them not know that I am the Master.”\r\n\r\n“The Master’s will is sweet,” said the Dog-man, with the ready tact of\r\nhis canine blood.\r\n\r\n“But one has sinned,” said I. “Him I will kill, whenever I may meet\r\nhim. When I say to you, ‘_That is he_,’ see that you fall upon him. And\r\nnow I will go to the men and women who are assembled together.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment the opening of the hut was blackened by the exit of the\r\nDog-man. Then I followed and stood up, almost in the exact spot where I\r\nhad been when I had heard Moreau and his staghound pursuing me. But now\r\nit was night, and all the miasmatic ravine about me was black; and\r\nbeyond, instead of a green, sunlit slope, I saw a red fire, before\r\nwhich hunched, grotesque figures moved to and fro. Farther were the\r\nthick trees, a bank of darkness, fringed above with the black lace of\r\nthe upper branches. The moon was just riding up on the edge of the\r\nravine, and like a bar across its face drove the spire of vapour that\r\nwas for ever streaming from the fumaroles of the island.\r\n\r\n“Walk by me,” said I, nerving myself; and side by side we walked down\r\nthe narrow way, taking little heed of the dim Things that peered at us\r\nout of the huts.\r\n\r\nNone about the fire attempted to salute me. Most of them disregarded\r\nme, ostentatiously. I looked round for the Hyena-swine, but he was not\r\nthere. Altogether, perhaps twenty of the Beast Folk squatted, staring\r\ninto the fire or talking to one another.\r\n\r\n“He is dead, he is dead! the Master is dead!” said the voice of the\r\nApe-man to the right of me. “The House of Pain—there is no House of\r\nPain!”\r\n\r\n“He is not dead,” said I, in a loud voice. “Even now he watches us!”\r\n\r\nThis startled them. Twenty pairs of eyes regarded me.\r\n\r\n“The House of Pain is gone,” said I. “It will come again. The Master\r\nyou cannot see; yet even now he listens among you.”\r\n\r\n“True, true!” said the Dog-man.\r\n\r\nThey were staggered at my assurance. An animal may be ferocious and\r\ncunning enough, but it takes a real man to tell a lie.\r\n\r\n“The Man with the Bandaged Arm speaks a strange thing,” said one of the\r\nBeast Folk.\r\n\r\n“I tell you it is so,” I said. “The Master and the House of Pain will\r\ncome again. Woe be to him who breaks the Law!”\r\n\r\nThey looked curiously at one another. With an affectation of\r\nindifference I began to chop idly at the ground in front of me with my\r\nhatchet. They looked, I noticed, at the deep cuts I made in the turf.\r\n\r\nThen the Satyr raised a doubt. I answered him. Then one of the dappled\r\nthings objected, and an animated discussion sprang up round the fire.\r\nEvery moment I began to feel more convinced of my present security. I\r\ntalked now without the catching in my breath, due to the intensity of\r\nmy excitement, that had troubled me at first. In the course of about an\r\nhour I had really convinced several of the Beast Folk of the truth of\r\nmy assertions, and talked most of the others into a dubious state. I\r\nkept a sharp eye for my enemy the Hyena-swine, but he never appeared.\r\nEvery now and then a suspicious movement would startle me, but my\r\nconfidence grew rapidly. Then as the moon crept down from the zenith,\r\none by one the listeners began to yawn (showing the oddest teeth in the\r\nlight of the sinking fire), and first one and then another retired\r\ntowards the dens in the ravine; and I, dreading the silence and\r\ndarkness, went with them, knowing I was safer with several of them than\r\nwith one alone.\r\n\r\nIn this manner began the longer part of my sojourn upon this Island of\r\nDoctor Moreau. But from that night until the end came, there was but\r\none thing happened to tell save a series of innumerable small\r\nunpleasant details and the fretting of an incessant uneasiness. So that\r\nI prefer to make no chronicle for that gap of time, to tell only one\r\ncardinal incident of the ten months I spent as an intimate of these\r\nhalf-humanised brutes. There is much that sticks in my memory that I\r\ncould write,—things that I would cheerfully give my right hand to\r\nforget; but they do not help the telling of the story.\r\n\r\nIn the retrospect it is strange to remember how soon I fell in with\r\nthese monsters’ ways, and gained my confidence again. I had my quarrels\r\nwith them of course, and could show some of their teeth-marks still;\r\nbut they soon gained a wholesome respect for my trick of throwing\r\nstones and for the bite of my hatchet. And my Saint-Bernard-man’s\r\nloyalty was of infinite service to me. I found their simple scale of\r\nhonour was based mainly on the capacity for inflicting trenchant\r\nwounds. Indeed, I may say—without vanity, I hope—that I held something\r\nlike pre-eminence among them. One or two, whom in a rare access of high\r\nspirits I had scarred rather badly, bore me a grudge; but it vented\r\nitself chiefly behind my back, and at a safe distance from my missiles,\r\nin grimaces.\r\n\r\nThe Hyena-swine avoided me, and I was always on the alert for him. My\r\ninseparable Dog-man hated and dreaded him intensely. I really believe\r\nthat was at the root of the brute’s attachment to me. It was soon\r\nevident to me that the former monster had tasted blood, and gone the\r\nway of the Leopard-man. He formed a lair somewhere in the forest, and\r\nbecame solitary. Once I tried to induce the Beast Folk to hunt him, but\r\nI lacked the authority to make them co-operate for one end. Again and\r\nagain I tried to approach his den and come upon him unaware; but always\r\nhe was too acute for me, and saw or winded me and got away. He too made\r\nevery forest pathway dangerous to me and my ally with his lurking\r\nambuscades. The Dog-man scarcely dared to leave my side.\r\n\r\nIn the first month or so the Beast Folk, compared with their latter\r\ncondition, were human enough, and for one or two besides my canine\r\nfriend I even conceived a friendly tolerance. The little pink\r\nsloth-creature displayed an odd affection for me, and took to following\r\nme about. The Monkey-man bored me, however; he assumed, on the strength\r\nof his five digits, that he was my equal, and was for ever jabbering at\r\nme,—jabbering the most arrant nonsense. One thing about him entertained\r\nme a little: he had a fantastic trick of coining new words. He had an\r\nidea, I believe, that to gabble about names that meant nothing was the\r\nproper use of speech. He called it “Big Thinks” to distinguish it from\r\n“Little Thinks,” the sane every-day interests of life. If ever I made a\r\nremark he did not understand, he would praise it very much, ask me to\r\nsay it again, learn it by heart, and go off repeating it, with a word\r\nwrong here or there, to all the milder of the Beast People. He thought\r\nnothing of what was plain and comprehensible. I invented some very\r\ncurious “Big Thinks” for his especial use. I think now that he was the\r\nsilliest creature I ever met; he had developed in the most wonderful\r\nway the distinctive silliness of man without losing one jot of the\r\nnatural folly of a monkey.\r\n\r\nThis, I say, was in the earlier weeks of my solitude among these\r\nbrutes. During that time they respected the usage established by the\r\nLaw, and behaved with general decorum. Once I found another rabbit torn\r\nto pieces,—by the Hyena-swine, I am assured,—but that was all. It was\r\nabout May when I first distinctly perceived a growing difference in\r\ntheir speech and carriage, a growing coarseness of articulation, a\r\ngrowing disinclination to talk. My Monkey-man’s jabber multiplied in\r\nvolume but grew less and less comprehensible, more and more simian.\r\nSome of the others seemed altogether slipping their hold upon speech,\r\nthough they still understood what I said to them at that time. (Can you\r\nimagine language, once clear-cut and exact, softening and guttering,\r\nlosing shape and import, becoming mere lumps of sound again?) And they\r\nwalked erect with an increasing difficulty. Though they evidently felt\r\nashamed of themselves, every now and then I would come upon one or\r\nanother running on toes and finger-tips, and quite unable to recover\r\nthe vertical attitude. They held things more clumsily; drinking by\r\nsuction, feeding by gnawing, grew commoner every day. I realised more\r\nkeenly than ever what Moreau had told me about the “stubborn\r\nbeast-flesh.” They were reverting, and reverting very rapidly.\r\n\r\nSome of them—the pioneers in this, I noticed with some surprise, were\r\nall females—began to disregard the injunction of decency, deliberately\r\nfor the most part. Others even attempted public outrages upon the\r\ninstitution of monogamy. The tradition of the Law was clearly losing\r\nits force. I cannot pursue this disagreeable subject.\r\n\r\nMy Dog-man imperceptibly slipped back to the dog again; day by day he\r\nbecame dumb, quadrupedal, hairy. I scarcely noticed the transition from\r\nthe companion on my right hand to the lurching dog at my side.\r\n\r\nAs the carelessness and disorganisation increased from day to day, the\r\nlane of dwelling places, at no time very sweet, became so loathsome\r\nthat I left it, and going across the island made myself a hovel of\r\nboughs amid the black ruins of Moreau’s enclosure. Some memory of pain,\r\nI found, still made that place the safest from the Beast Folk.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to detail every step of the lapsing of these\r\nmonsters,—to tell how, day by day, the human semblance left them; how\r\nthey gave up bandagings and wrappings, abandoned at last every stitch\r\nof clothing; how the hair began to spread over the exposed limbs; how\r\ntheir foreheads fell away and their faces projected; how the\r\nquasi-human intimacy I had permitted myself with some of them in the\r\nfirst month of my loneliness became a shuddering horror to recall.\r\n\r\nThe change was slow and inevitable. For them and for me it came without\r\nany definite shock. I still went among them in safety, because no jolt\r\nin the downward glide had released the increasing charge of explosive\r\nanimalism that ousted the human day by day. But I began to fear that\r\nsoon now that shock must come. My Saint-Bernard-brute followed me to\r\nthe enclosure every night, and his vigilance enabled me to sleep at\r\ntimes in something like peace. The little pink sloth-thing became shy\r\nand left me, to crawl back to its natural life once more among the\r\ntree-branches. We were in just the state of equilibrium that would\r\nremain in one of those “Happy Family” cages which animal-tamers\r\nexhibit, if the tamer were to leave it for ever.\r\n\r\nOf course these creatures did not decline into such beasts as the\r\nreader has seen in zoological gardens,—into ordinary bears, wolves,\r\ntigers, oxen, swine, and apes. There was still something strange about\r\neach; in each Moreau had blended this animal with that. One perhaps was\r\nursine chiefly, another feline chiefly, another bovine chiefly; but\r\neach was tainted with other creatures,—a kind of generalised animalism\r\nappearing through the specific dispositions. And the dwindling shreds\r\nof the humanity still startled me every now and then,—a momentary\r\nrecrudescence of speech perhaps, an unexpected dexterity of the\r\nfore-feet, a pitiful attempt to walk erect.\r\n\r\nI too must have undergone strange changes. My clothes hung about me as\r\nyellow rags, through whose rents showed the tanned skin. My hair grew\r\nlong, and became matted together. I am told that even now my eyes have\r\na strange brightness, a swift alertness of movement.\r\n\r\nAt first I spent the daylight hours on the southward beach watching for\r\na ship, hoping and praying for a ship. I counted on the _Ipecacuanha_\r\nreturning as the year wore on; but she never came. Five times I saw\r\nsails, and thrice smoke; but nothing ever touched the island. I always\r\nhad a bonfire ready, but no doubt the volcanic reputation of the island\r\nwas taken to account for that.\r\n\r\nIt was only about September or October that I began to think of making\r\na raft. By that time my arm had healed, and both my hands were at my\r\nservice again. At first, I found my helplessness appalling. I had never\r\ndone any carpentry or such-like work in my life, and I spent day after\r\nday in experimental chopping and binding among the trees. I had no\r\nropes, and could hit on nothing wherewith to make ropes; none of the\r\nabundant creepers seemed limber or strong enough, and with all my\r\nlitter of scientific education I could not devise any way of making\r\nthem so. I spent more than a fortnight grubbing among the black ruins\r\nof the enclosure and on the beach where the boats had been burnt,\r\nlooking for nails and other stray pieces of metal that might prove of\r\nservice. Now and then some Beast-creature would watch me, and go\r\nleaping off when I called to it. There came a season of thunder-storms\r\nand heavy rain, which greatly retarded my work; but at last the raft\r\nwas completed.\r\n\r\nI was delighted with it. But with a certain lack of practical sense\r\nwhich has always been my bane, I had made it a mile or more from the\r\nsea; and before I had dragged it down to the beach the thing had fallen\r\nto pieces. Perhaps it is as well that I was saved from launching it;\r\nbut at the time my misery at my failure was so acute that for some days\r\nI simply moped on the beach, and stared at the water and thought of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nI did not, however, mean to die, and an incident occurred that warned\r\nme unmistakably of the folly of letting the days pass so,—for each\r\nfresh day was fraught with increasing danger from the Beast People.\r\n\r\nI was lying in the shade of the enclosure wall, staring out to sea,\r\nwhen I was startled by something cold touching the skin of my heel, and\r\nstarting round found the little pink sloth-creature blinking into my\r\nface. He had long since lost speech and active movement, and the lank\r\nhair of the little brute grew thicker every day and his stumpy claws\r\nmore askew. He made a moaning noise when he saw he had attracted my\r\nattention, went a little way towards the bushes and looked back at me.\r\n\r\nAt first I did not understand, but presently it occurred to me that he\r\nwished me to follow him; and this I did at last,—slowly, for the day\r\nwas hot. When we reached the trees he clambered into them, for he could\r\ntravel better among their swinging creepers than on the ground. And\r\nsuddenly in a trampled space I came upon a ghastly group. My\r\nSaint-Bernard-creature lay on the ground, dead; and near his body\r\ncrouched the Hyena-swine, gripping the quivering flesh with its\r\nmisshapen claws, gnawing at it, and snarling with delight. As I\r\napproached, the monster lifted its glaring eyes to mine, its lips went\r\ntrembling back from its red-stained teeth, and it growled menacingly.\r\nIt was not afraid and not ashamed; the last vestige of the human taint\r\nhad vanished. I advanced a step farther, stopped, and pulled out my\r\nrevolver. At last I had him face to face.\r\n\r\nThe brute made no sign of retreat; but its ears went back, its hair\r\nbristled, and its body crouched together. I aimed between the eyes and\r\nfired. As I did so, the Thing rose straight at me in a leap, and I was\r\nknocked over like a ninepin. It clutched at me with its crippled hand,\r\nand struck me in the face. Its spring carried it over me. I fell under\r\nthe hind part of its body; but luckily I had hit as I meant, and it had\r\ndied even as it leapt. I crawled out from under its unclean weight and\r\nstood up trembling, staring at its quivering body. That danger at least\r\nwas over; but this, I knew was only the first of the series of relapses\r\nthat must come.\r\n\r\nI burnt both of the bodies on a pyre of brushwood; but after that I saw\r\nthat unless I left the island my death was only a question of time. The\r\nBeast People by that time had, with one or two exceptions, left the\r\nravine and made themselves lairs according to their taste among the\r\nthickets of the island. Few prowled by day, most of them slept, and the\r\nisland might have seemed deserted to a new-comer; but at night the air\r\nwas hideous with their calls and howling. I had half a mind to make a\r\nmassacre of them; to build traps, or fight them with my knife. Had I\r\npossessed sufficient cartridges, I should not have hesitated to begin\r\nthe killing. There could now be scarcely a score left of the dangerous\r\ncarnivores; the braver of these were already dead. After the death of\r\nthis poor dog of mine, my last friend, I too adopted to some extent the\r\npractice of slumbering in the daytime in order to be on my guard at\r\nnight. I rebuilt my den in the walls of the enclosure, with such a\r\nnarrow opening that anything attempting to enter must necessarily make\r\na considerable noise. The creatures had lost the art of fire too, and\r\nrecovered their fear of it. I turned once more, almost passionately\r\nnow, to hammering together stakes and branches to form a raft for my\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nI found a thousand difficulties. I am an extremely unhandy man (my\r\nschooling was over before the days of Slöjd); but most of the\r\nrequirements of a raft I met at last in some clumsy, circuitous way or\r\nother, and this time I took care of the strength. The only\r\ninsurmountable obstacle was that I had no vessel to contain the water I\r\nshould need if I floated forth upon these untravelled seas. I would\r\nhave even tried pottery, but the island contained no clay. I used to go\r\nmoping about the island trying with all my might to solve this one last\r\ndifficulty. Sometimes I would give way to wild outbursts of rage, and\r\nhack and splinter some unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation. But I\r\ncould think of nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd then came a day, a wonderful day, which I spent in ecstasy. I saw a\r\nsail to the southwest, a small sail like that of a little schooner; and\r\nforthwith I lit a great pile of brushwood, and stood by it in the heat\r\nof it, and the heat of the midday sun, watching. All day I watched that\r\nsail, eating or drinking nothing, so that my head reeled; and the\r\nBeasts came and glared at me, and seemed to wonder, and went away. It\r\nwas still distant when night came and swallowed it up; and all night I\r\ntoiled to keep my blaze bright and high, and the eyes of the Beasts\r\nshone out of the darkness, marvelling. In the dawn the sail was nearer,\r\nand I saw it was the dirty lug-sail of a small boat. But it sailed\r\nstrangely. My eyes were weary with watching, and I peered and could not\r\nbelieve them. Two men were in the boat, sitting low down,—one by the\r\nbows, the other at the rudder. The head was not kept to the wind; it\r\nyawed and fell away.\r\n\r\nAs the day grew brighter, I began waving the last rag of my jacket to\r\nthem; but they did not notice me, and sat still, facing each other. I\r\nwent to the lowest point of the low headland, and gesticulated and\r\nshouted. There was no response, and the boat kept on her aimless\r\ncourse, making slowly, very slowly, for the bay. Suddenly a great white\r\nbird flew up out of the boat, and neither of the men stirred nor\r\nnoticed it; it circled round, and then came sweeping overhead with its\r\nstrong wings outspread.\r\n\r\nThen I stopped shouting, and sat down on the headland and rested my\r\nchin on my hands and stared. Slowly, slowly, the boat drove past\r\ntowards the west. I would have swum out to it, but something—a cold,\r\nvague fear—kept me back. In the afternoon the tide stranded the boat,\r\nand left it a hundred yards or so to the westward of the ruins of the\r\nenclosure. The men in it were dead, had been dead so long that they\r\nfell to pieces when I tilted the boat on its side and dragged them out.\r\nOne had a shock of red hair, like the captain of the _Ipecacuanha_, and\r\na dirty white cap lay in the bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\nAs I stood beside the boat, three of the Beasts came slinking out of\r\nthe bushes and sniffing towards me. One of my spasms of disgust came\r\nupon me. I thrust the little boat down the beach and clambered on board\r\nher. Two of the brutes were Wolf-beasts, and came forward with\r\nquivering nostrils and glittering eyes; the third was the horrible\r\nnondescript of bear and bull. When I saw them approaching those\r\nwretched remains, heard them snarling at one another and caught the\r\ngleam of their teeth, a frantic horror succeeded my repulsion. I turned\r\nmy back upon them, struck the lug and began paddling out to sea. I\r\ncould not bring myself to look behind me.\r\n\r\nI lay, however, between the reef and the island that night, and the\r\nnext morning went round to the stream and filled the empty keg aboard\r\nwith water. Then, with such patience as I could command, I collected a\r\nquantity of fruit, and waylaid and killed two rabbits with my last\r\nthree cartridges. While I was doing this I left the boat moored to an\r\ninward projection of the reef, for fear of the Beast People.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\nTHE MAN ALONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening I started, and drove out to sea before a gentle wind\r\nfrom the southwest, slowly, steadily; and the island grew smaller and\r\nsmaller, and the lank spire of smoke dwindled to a finer and finer line\r\nagainst the hot sunset. The ocean rose up around me, hiding that low,\r\ndark patch from my eyes. The daylight, the trailing glory of the sun,\r\nwent streaming out of the sky, was drawn aside like some luminous\r\ncurtain, and at last I looked into the blue gulf of immensity which the\r\nsunshine hides, and saw the floating hosts of the stars. The sea was\r\nsilent, the sky was silent. I was alone with the night and silence.\r\n\r\nSo I drifted for three days, eating and drinking sparingly, and\r\nmeditating upon all that had happened to me,—not desiring very greatly\r\nthen to see men again. One unclean rag was about me, my hair a black\r\ntangle: no doubt my discoverers thought me a madman.\r\n\r\nIt is strange, but I felt no desire to return to mankind. I was only\r\nglad to be quit of the foulness of the Beast People. And on the third\r\nday I was picked up by a brig from Apia to San Francisco. Neither the\r\ncaptain nor the mate would believe my story, judging that solitude and\r\ndanger had made me mad; and fearing their opinion might be that of\r\nothers, I refrained from telling my adventure further, and professed to\r\nrecall nothing that had happened to me between the loss of the _Lady\r\nVain_ and the time when I was picked up again,—the space of a year.\r\n\r\nI had to act with the utmost circumspection to save myself from the\r\nsuspicion of insanity. My memory of the Law, of the two dead sailors,\r\nof the ambuscades of the darkness, of the body in the canebrake,\r\nhaunted me; and, unnatural as it seems, with my return to mankind came,\r\ninstead of that confidence and sympathy I had expected, a strange\r\nenhancement of the uncertainty and dread I had experienced during my\r\nstay upon the island. No one would believe me; I was almost as queer to\r\nmen as I had been to the Beast People. I may have caught something of\r\nthe natural wildness of my companions. They say that terror is a\r\ndisease, and anyhow I can witness that for several years now a restless\r\nfear has dwelt in my mind,—such a restless fear as a half-tamed lion\r\ncub may feel.\r\n\r\nMy trouble took the strangest form. I could not persuade myself that\r\nthe men and women I met were not also another Beast People, animals\r\nhalf wrought into the outward image of human souls, and that they would\r\npresently begin to revert,—to show first this bestial mark and then\r\nthat. But I have confided my case to a strangely able man,—a man who\r\nhad known Moreau, and seemed half to credit my story; a mental\r\nspecialist,—and he has helped me mightily, though I do not expect that\r\nthe terror of that island will ever altogether leave me. At most times\r\nit lies far in the back of my mind, a mere distant cloud, a memory, and\r\na faint distrust; but there are times when the little cloud spreads\r\nuntil it obscures the whole sky. Then I look about me at my fellow-men;\r\nand I go in fear. I see faces, keen and bright; others dull or\r\ndangerous; others, unsteady, insincere,—none that have the calm\r\nauthority of a reasonable soul. I feel as though the animal was surging\r\nup through them; that presently the degradation of the Islanders will\r\nbe played over again on a larger scale. I know this is an illusion;\r\nthat these seeming men and women about me are indeed men and women,—men\r\nand women for ever, perfectly reasonable creatures, full of human\r\ndesires and tender solicitude, emancipated from instinct and the slaves\r\nof no fantastic Law,—beings altogether different from the Beast Folk.\r\nYet I shrink from them, from their curious glances, their inquiries and\r\nassistance, and long to be away from them and alone. For that reason I\r\nlive near the broad free downland, and can escape thither when this\r\nshadow is over my soul; and very sweet is the empty downland then,\r\nunder the wind-swept sky.\r\n\r\nWhen I lived in London the horror was well-nigh insupportable. I could\r\nnot get away from men: their voices came through windows; locked doors\r\nwere flimsy safeguards. I would go out into the streets to fight with\r\nmy delusion, and prowling women would mew after me; furtive, craving\r\nmen glance jealously at me; weary, pale workers go coughing by me with\r\ntired eyes and eager paces, like wounded deer dripping blood; old\r\npeople, bent and dull, pass murmuring to themselves; and, all\r\nunheeding, a ragged tail of gibing children. Then I would turn aside\r\ninto some chapel,—and even there, such was my disturbance, it seemed\r\nthat the preacher gibbered “Big Thinks,” even as the Ape-man had done;\r\nor into some library, and there the intent faces over the books seemed\r\nbut patient creatures waiting for prey. Particularly nauseous were the\r\nblank, expressionless faces of people in trains and omnibuses; they\r\nseemed no more my fellow-creatures than dead bodies would be, so that I\r\ndid not dare to travel unless I was assured of being alone. And even it\r\nseemed that I too was not a reasonable creature, but only an animal\r\ntormented with some strange disorder in its brain which sent it to\r\nwander alone, like a sheep stricken with gid.\r\n\r\nThis is a mood, however, that comes to me now, I thank God, more\r\nrarely. I have withdrawn myself from the confusion of cities and\r\nmultitudes, and spend my days surrounded by wise books,—bright windows\r\nin this life of ours, lit by the shining souls of men. I see few\r\nstrangers, and have but a small household. My days I devote to reading\r\nand to experiments in chemistry, and I spend many of the clear nights\r\nin the study of astronomy. There is—though I do not know how there is\r\nor why there is—a sense of infinite peace and protection in the\r\nglittering hosts of heaven. There it must be, I think, in the vast and\r\neternal laws of matter, and not in the daily cares and sins and\r\ntroubles of men, that whatever is more than animal within us must find\r\nits solace and its hope. I _hope_, or I could not live.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so, in hope and solitude, my story ends.\r\n\r\nEDWARD PRENDICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe substance of the chapter entitled “Doctor Moreau explains,” which\r\ncontains the essential idea of the story, appeared as a middle article\r\nin the _Saturday Review_ in January, 1895.
