I. PHILADELPHIA, _First Month_, 1820. _No._ 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not without feelings of anxiety that the editors of the RURAL\r\nMAGAZINE issue forth their first number to the public; for they\r\nare aware of the lasting effect of a first impression, and that\r\nthey have now fairly embarked in an adventure, the success and the\r\ntermination of which are alike uncertain. Diffident however as\r\nthey are of their own abilities, they have full confidence in the\r\nexcellence of their plan, and the kindness and assistance of their\r\nfriends. Of the value of this assistance, the work itself will\r\ntestify; of the plan which they have marked out, it is but fair that\r\nthe reader should be informed.\r\n\r\nA leading object of the _Rural Magazine_ will be to furnish correct\r\nviews of the science of Agriculture, and the various improvements\r\nwhich are daily made or suggested in it. For this purpose the best\r\nand most recent European works on the subject will be consulted,\r\nand selections made from the American newspapers that are devoted\r\nor friendly to the cause. The best information on the subject will\r\nthus be condensed in a form less unwieldy than a newspaper, and more\r\npopular than in scientific books. We also expect original papers\r\nfrom our agricultural friends, being confident that there is much\r\nin the farming of our neighbouring counties, well worthy of being\r\nwidely known and imitated.\r\n\r\nYet, as we wish our Magazine to have an extensive circulation, and\r\nto be interesting not merely to the farmer, but to the citizen and\r\nthe general reader, a considerable part of every number will be\r\noccupied with topics of general literature, selections from approved\r\nnew publications, particularly Biography and Travels, Essays, and\r\ninformation on scientific subjects; and original miscellaneous\r\ncommunications. To original and well written essays, our pages will\r\nalways be accessible; and we particularly solicit such as will\r\nthrow light on the history, antiquities, geography, curiosities,\r\nand productions of our own country. With the genuine productions of\r\nthe Muse we shall always be glad to adorn our pages; but we have\r\nno desire to patronize the unfledged attempts at versifying, the\r\nlamentable ditties with which the public is weekly besieged, for we\r\nhold that in poetry there is no tolerable medium.\r\n\r\nBut to an American and a philanthropist, there are still higher\r\nobjects to be gained by the circulation of such a paper, than the\r\nmere diffusion of agricultural intelligence or general literature.\r\nHe lives under a system of government which is ideally perfect;\r\nand he sees it distorted by the vices and the passions of its\r\nsubjects. He is the disciple of a religion which breathes good-will\r\nto mankind; and on whichsoever side he turns, are to be seen\r\noppression, the darkness of ignorance, self-inflicted wretchedness,\r\nand amalgamating corruption. He sees a large portion of the human\r\nfamily held in chains by the very nation that has pronounced all\r\nmen to be free and equal. The condition of that unhappy race, even\r\nwhen emancipated, excites his deepest commiseration and most anxious\r\nfears. He sees the aborigines of our country, a noble race of men,\r\nperishing like the beasts of the forest before our approach; and\r\nthat under every circumstance of wretchedness and degeneracy.--Above\r\nall, the great and fatal delusion of war, more bloody than the\r\nsuperstitions of Moloch, still overspreads the world, and renders\r\nman the destroyer of man.\r\n\r\nTo all these subjects will the _Rural Magazine_ be watchful and\r\nalive; for the editors believe them to be subjects of the deepest\r\ninterest, and having relation to our highest duties. He who tills\r\nhis field, or pursues his occupation with diligence and skill, is\r\na deserving and honourable citizen. He who, in addition to this,\r\ncultivates his mind, and stores it with useful and ornamental\r\nknowledge, raises himself in the scale of being, and adds to\r\nhis capacities both for happiness and usefulness. But when he\r\nadds to this industry, and to these talents and accomplishments,\r\nthe benevolence of a Christian philanthropist, and renders them\r\nsubservient to the welfare of his species, he attains to the highest\r\ndignity of his nature, and fulfils all the obligations which devolve\r\non him as a citizen and a man.\r\n\r\nSuch are the general outlines of our plan; and as we feel no\r\nlocal or political prejudices, they shall never have place in the\r\ndiscussion of any subject which may appear in our columns. Combining\r\nin this manner an agricultural, a literary, and philanthropic\r\njournal, we look with confidence to the support of our enlightened\r\nfellow citizens; and assure them, that no exertions on our part\r\nshall be wanting to fill up the measure which we have meted out, and\r\nrender the _Rural Magazine_ deserving of their patronage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editors._\r\n\r\nYou are about embarking in a literary voyage, calculated, if ably\r\nand prudently conducted, to subserve the best interests of society.\r\nPreviously, however, to your taking a final leave of terra firma,\r\nand before its shores shall recede from your view, it may be the\r\npart of wisdom to contemplate the nature and object of your journey,\r\nby the steady lights of experience. The legitimate end of every\r\nenterprise of the kind, is to enlighten the understanding, and\r\nimprove the heart. To produce a result so important, no exertion\r\nshould be omitted, and no means neglected, to impart a useful\r\ninterest to your miscellany. Of the truth of these preliminary\r\nobservations, you are no doubt sufficiently impressed. To please\r\nevery taste, however fastidious, or to gratify in all respects,\r\nthe wishes of the million, would be a task altogether hopeless;\r\nand which a temperament the most sanguine, would scarcely indulge.\r\nHowever transcendent may be the merit of any periodical journal, and\r\nhowever brilliant its success, should the editor listen at all the\r\navenues of public opinion, his ear will notwithstanding be saluted\r\nby many an ungrateful sound. Some readers will complain of what they\r\nare pleased to call its dull monotony; while others will lament the\r\nsacrifice of what they conceive to be matters of importance, in\r\nthe pursuit of endless variety.--Those who seek for novelty alone,\r\nwill sometimes be disappointed; while others will start objections,\r\nbecause sufficient respect is not accorded to the venerated opinions\r\nof the olden time. The gay may sometimes meet with nothing to excite\r\nthe smile of merriment, and the grave and reflecting may regret\r\nto find so little solid food for the mind. He, however versatile\r\nhis talents, who would be a favourite with them all, must first\r\nbe successful in his chase of the ignis fatuus; or obtain from\r\nthat fairy region in which the rainbow reposes its brilliant arch\r\nupon the earth, its treasures of gold. But if your labours should\r\nhappily tend to give \"energy to virtue, and confidence to truth,\"\r\nyou will not fail to gratify the wishes of those whose approbation\r\nalone is worth desiring--_the well principled_ of all parties.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, and repeated times without number, that to call\r\na rose by any other name, its odour would be equally delightful.\r\nAlthough the fact may be so, the inference that a name is altogether\r\nunimportant, cannot be supported on just principles of deduction.\r\nAuthors, who have reflected the brightest honours on the cause\r\nof literature and virtue by their writings, have encountered\r\na difficulty at the very threshold, in selecting for them an\r\nappropriate name. It was after some time anxiously devoted to the\r\nsubject, by which it would appear _they_ considered it a matter\r\nof no trifling consequence, that the pious and elegant _Addison_\r\nadopted that of a Spectator, and the _Sage_ of Litchfield that\r\nof a Rambler; under which, with such signal effect, to inculcate\r\nthe lessons of moral truth. It has been observed by one who knew\r\nsomething of the world, that few circumstances contribute more\r\nessentially to general success in life, than an engaging first\r\nappearance. So, likewise, the garb in which it appears, as well as\r\nthe name by which it is distinguished, is more intimately connected\r\nwith the extensive popularity of a work, intended for the general\r\nreader, than at first may be supposed. It is gratifying therefore\r\nto find, that both these considerations have had with you their due\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThe _Rural Magazine_ will not only be a repository for articles of\r\nmiscellaneous interest, but peculiarly so for every thing connected\r\nwith agriculture, and a country residence. It is to rural scenes,\r\nand rural innocence, and rural employments, that man is principally\r\nindebted for many of those blessings and enjoyments, which impart\r\na charm to human existence, and lighten its load of cares and\r\nsorrows. The man, whoever he is, that has long been confined to\r\na populous city, will at length with _Shenstone_ sicken with the\r\nunceasing recurrence of artificial life, and long to breathe the\r\npure atmosphere of the country. He will hail with delight the blue\r\nbird, earliest harbinger of spring, and welcome the primrose,\r\neldest daughter of Flora, and contemplate with rapture the vernal\r\nseason, in which youth, and beauty, and melody, walk hand in hand,\r\nover verdant lawns, variegated with flowers, inhaling the zephyrs\r\nof health. Then he will witness summer, with brown, vigorous, and\r\nmanly aspects; and autumn, groaning with her ripe and mellow fruits;\r\nsucceeded by winter, clothed in storms and glittering with pendent\r\nicicles; who notwithstanding a sternness of mood, and a manner\r\nsomewhat uncourteous, is in the hands of a beneficent Creator the\r\nminister of great good to man. The fury of the tempest may rage,\r\nand the clattering hail beat against the windows; the driving snows\r\nmay deform the face of day, and nature assume the appearance of\r\nold age and decay: notwithstanding all this, that portion of the\r\ncircling year, of which we are speaking, will continue to have its\r\npositive pleasures. These will be closely and intimately united\r\nin the domestic circle, where in charmful confederacy they will\r\nbe found clustering round the _Evening Fire-side_. Who does not\r\nassociate with this delightful scene his earliest images of innocent\r\ngayety and exquisite enjoyment; in which garrulous old age and\r\nlisping infancy mingle their voices, and where carking care never\r\nintrudes? But as the hours are hastening on with feathery footsteps,\r\nthey should likewise minister to the cause of mental and moral\r\nimprovement. The _farmer_ should cultivate a taste for reading, and\r\nstore his mind with useful knowledge; and thus become qualified to\r\nassume the dignified station to which, in this happy country, he\r\nis fairly entitled. He should remember, that the plough has been\r\nguided and venerated by the \"awful fathers of mankind;\" and that a\r\nprofession, to which _Cincinnatus_ and _Washington_ were zealously\r\nand practically devoted, and for which the emperor _Charles_ V.\r\nexchanged his sceptre and his crown, must be intrinsically elevated\r\nand respectable. It is among the yeomanry of our country that the\r\nlove of literature, by whom it is already cherished to a creditable\r\ndegree, should be more widely and universally disseminated.\r\n\r\nIn order to promote an object so desirable, may you succeed in\r\nassembling at your _Evening Fire-side_ a cheerful happy group, who,\r\nbidding defiance to the rude clamours of the storm without, shall\r\nentertain topics of public utility, while cultivating and improving\r\nthe domestic virtues; and with warm and expansive gratitude ascribe\r\ntheir blessings to a benignant Providence, _from whom alone they are\r\nall derived_.\r\n\r\n  E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n_Letters of a Citizen to his Friends in the Country_.\r\n\r\nNO 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a periodical work, designed in part for\r\ncirculation among my agricultural fellow citizens, furnishes\r\nan opportunity which I have often desired, to address you. In\r\ncontemplating the dignity and utility which are combined in the\r\noccupations of an American husbandman, in estimating the extent of\r\ninfluence which belongs to his character, and regarding his elevated\r\nindependence, I have long since been led to the conclusion, that the\r\n_Farmers_ of the soil form the basis of the nation's strength, and\r\nought largely to contribute to its ornament.\r\n\r\nIn the occasional communications which I propose to make to you\r\nthrough this medium, I shall adopt a plain, familiar, and candid\r\nmanner; and endeavour to point not only at those errors which\r\ncertainly exist, but also attempt to suggest how they can be most\r\neffectually removed.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" methinks I hear some hardy son of the field exclaim--\"who\r\nis this that promises to improve our mode of farming?\" _A Citizen,\r\nforsooth._ Now let us at the threshold understand each other.\r\nI do not intend to meddle much, if at all, with your system of\r\nagriculture, though I conceive it quite possible for a man who has\r\nbeen born and educated in a _city_, to furnish important hints for\r\nthe improvement of rural affairs. My purpose is to interest your\r\nattention with subjects which may tend to enlarge and elevate your\r\n_minds_. It is a lamentable fact, that too little regard is paid to\r\n_intellectual cultivation_, among those who till the earth.\r\n\r\nA well managed farm, supplied with substantial buildings, and\r\nunder good fence, is creditable to its possessor, and forms a\r\npart of the public wealth. Every individual who thus improves his\r\nland, not only enriches himself, but should be considered as a\r\nbenefactor of the commonwealth. Here, unhappily, the energies of\r\nthe farmer are limited. This is a radical error. With the pecuniary\r\nmeans which his industry has accumulated, he should increase his\r\nown intelligence, and confer upon his children the benefits of\r\n_substantial education_. I do not admit as truth, what is frequently\r\nasserted, that the best examples of morality and virtue are to be\r\nmet with in the country; for whereever the improvement of the mind\r\nis neglected, those ennobling qualities will be rarely found. It is\r\nidle to suppose that our intellectual capacities will yield fruits\r\nwhich dignify and adorn our nature, if they be solely devoted to\r\nincrease our worldly possessions. The plough turns up from the\r\nsoil no nourishment for the mind, neither do the scythe and sickle\r\nprostrate the vices of the heart.\r\n\r\nAbstractedly, therefore, a man may be as destitute of good\r\nprinciples who lives amidst rural scenes, as he whose pursuits\r\nconfine him to the busy haunts and contagious influences of the\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\nBut I am beginning to lecture before I have an audience. I took up\r\nthe pen merely to introduce my proposals to your notice. You have a\r\nspecimen of my way of thinking. If you like it, so much the better;\r\nif not, I cannot promise to serve a more palatable dish--but am\r\nalways your friend,\r\n\r\n  CIVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     [The subject of the Missouri state bill, involves, in our\r\n     opinion, an agricultural question, important to the last degree\r\n     to the farmers of America:--Whether that great country west\r\n     of the Mississippi, compared with which all the United States\r\n     are small, shall, in future ages, be dotted over with pleasant\r\n     villages and comfortable farm houses, and cultivated by the\r\n     industrious owners of the soil, each vieing with his neighbour\r\n     in beautifying the face of nature: or be blotted and defaced by\r\n     innumerable wretched habitations of miserable slaves, with here\r\n     and there, on distant eminences, the _lone_ mansions of their\r\n     masters. Whether that great country, now left rich by nature,\r\n     shall be converted into barren wastes by continued exhausting\r\n     crops of tobacco and Indian corn, without one shovel-ful of\r\n     manure to invigorate the expiring soil, as has been the case\r\n     in some of the fine districts of Virginia and Maryland; or\r\n     whether it shall be covered with luxuriant fields of wheat, rich\r\n     meadows and innumerable herds.--Viewing this great national\r\n     question, so intimately connected with our favourite subject, we\r\n     feel the more interest by giving an insertion to the following\r\n     communication of our correspondent SANDIFORD.]--_Ed._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n_Extension of Slavery._\r\n\r\nIt is the great and distinguishing feature of our free government,\r\nthat it is built upon the eternal principles of justice and\r\nrectitude. The passions and the interests of its subjects or\r\nadministrators may pervert its original design, and wield the power\r\nit confers to the purposes of oppression or licentiousness. So long,\r\nhowever, as we have access to the charter of our constitution,\r\nthe great original fountain of our laws, we may renew or purify\r\nthose streams which have become choked up or polluted. It forms a\r\nperpetual and unerring standard by which to judge of principles and\r\npolicy; and whatever measures are found wanting in its scale, may\r\nsafely be pronounced to be unwise and unsound. The flux and change\r\nof opinions and interests, the perpetual encroachments of wealth and\r\npower, the decay of old prejudices and jealousies, and the rise of\r\nnew ones, wear away continually the old landmarks, and imperceptibly\r\ngive to our institutions a new aspect and new bearings. While we\r\nadmit this flexibility to be in a certain measure necessary for the\r\nconservation of peace and union, we must steadily insist upon its\r\nbeing limited by the great leading features of the constitution, and\r\nthat reference should constantly be had to first principles, as to a\r\nfountain of life and strength.\r\n\r\nNever, surely, has there been a question agitated, in which those\r\nprinciples were so deeply at issue, as in the one which is now\r\nbefore the American people. I need scarcely say, that I allude\r\nto the Missouri state bill, and to the introduction of slaves\r\nbeyond the Mississippi. This subject has been ably and repeatedly\r\ndiscussed. A universal expression of sentiment has gone forth from\r\nthe people of the northern and middle states, and it has awakened\r\npowers of eloquence and argument that have seldom been surpassed.\r\nThat first burst of emotion has subsided; and now that the question\r\nis upon the point of being settled, it may not be altogether useless\r\nto recall the attention of the public to the subject.\r\n\r\nThat slavery is a crime against God and nature, and that its\r\nexistence in our free country is a most dangerous and lamentable\r\nevil, cannot be doubted. Our only apology as a nation for its\r\nexistence, is, that we found it among us, and that an overruling\r\nnecessity obliged us to leave its extirpation to the hand of time\r\nand experience.\r\n\r\nThe august founders of our republic have not once named it in\r\nthe constitution, as if they were unwilling that so foul a name\r\nshould stain the purity of our escutcheon, as if it were a crime\r\nagainst humanity too execrable to be uttered. They looked forward\r\nto a period when it should cease and be forgotten, and made ample\r\nprovision for its future annihilation. Their solemn declaration\r\nto the world, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all\r\nmen are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator\r\nwith certain _unalienable_ rights, and that among these are life,\r\n_liberty_, and the pursuit of happiness,\" had otherwise been the\r\nworst of mockeries.\r\n\r\nThe words of the constitution, \"The migration or importation of such\r\npersons as any of the states _now existing_ shall think proper to\r\nadmit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress, prior to the year\r\n1808; but a tax may be imposed on such person not exceeding ten\r\ndollars for each person,\"--clearly show, beyond the possibility of\r\na cavil, that the right to legislate concerning slaves is vested in\r\nthe general government, and that the convention was fearful that\r\nthe attempt to exercise it might be made, before the southern\r\nstates were prepared for any laws upon the subject. The Congress\r\nhas, in fact, uniformly exercised this right in all its laws for\r\nthe government of the new states and territories. It prohibited the\r\nimportation of slaves and their migration into the northwestern\r\nterritory. The states which ceded the territory south of the Ohio,\r\nand east of the Mississippi, were fully aware of this power of\r\nCongress; and they ceded it with certain stipulations in favour\r\nof the slave holder. Yet even over the states which were formed\r\nin this region, has Congress exercised its power, and secured to\r\nthe slave the right of trial by jury and of the habeas corpus. All\r\nthese laws were passed without exciting any suspicion that Congress\r\nwas transcending its powers in thus clogging the constitutions\r\nof the new states. They were regarded as decent and becoming in\r\na government founded in justice and freedom, \"as extending the\r\nfundamental principles of civil and religious liberty.\" That\r\nnorthwestern territory offered no inducement to the slave holder,\r\nor to a slave agriculture. Now, however, the case is altered. A\r\nprovince adapted to the cultivation of cotton and tobacco, and\r\nin obtaining which the government made no stipulations in favour\r\nof slavery, claims to be elevated to the rank of a state. It is\r\na desirable situation for the planters, and holds out from its\r\nsituation and fertility a golden prospect. They claim accordingly\r\nto be admitted there, with their slaves; and a clamour is raised\r\nbecause the people of the United States are unwilling further to\r\nextend slavery--to sacrifice the principles of our republic upon the\r\naltar of avarice.\r\n\r\nThe pretence--it scarcely deserves the name of argument--is, that\r\nsuch restriction would be _unconstitutional_, _oppressive_, and\r\n_inexpedient_.\r\n\r\nIt is UNCONSTITUTIONAL!--The refutation is a part of our history,\r\nand is written in the pages of our statute book. It is OPPRESSIVE!\r\nIt would exclude the southern states from sharing in the benefits of\r\nthese new settlements. Are not the lands open to all, and disposed\r\nof at public sale? They can only be made valuable, it is true,\r\nby incessant labour, under severe privations. But this the hardy\r\nyeomanry of the eastern and middle states are willing to endure for\r\nthe sake of independence and an establishment for their families.\r\nWe see them accordingly in the van of our empire, subduing the\r\nforest and filling the wilderness with the busy sounds of industry\r\nand contentment. Are the slave holders of the south a privileged\r\norder, that these labours would demean them? Are they oppressed by\r\nbeing placed on an equality with their brethren of the north, who\r\nleave behind them all the artificial distinctions and luxurious\r\nindulgences of society? Are not their arms and limbs as capable of\r\nlabour, and their bodies of fatigue? Where then is the inequality\r\nand the oppression? A citizen of a slave holding state, at home, and\r\nunder his state laws, may be a petty monarch; and he is apt to fancy\r\nthat he derives the power from an inherent birth-right. But out of\r\nhis state, and from under its laws, he is an individual unit, a mere\r\ncitizen of the United States; and can claim no privilege which is\r\nnot granted to every American, or which is opposed to the spirit\r\nand intent of the constitution. That constitution pays no respect\r\nto persons. It does not recognise the existence of slavery; and the\r\npetition to admit it in the new states, is a glaring mockery of its\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt has been contended, that after the state was organized, the\r\ninhabitants might assemble in convention, and alter the constitution\r\nin this respect. Such an assertion betrays the grossest ignorance\r\nof the true principles of the Union. Our government is emphatically\r\na _compact_, originally between the people; and since then, between\r\nCongress as their representative, and the new members. It is binding\r\non both sides, and the terms of admission are, that Congress\r\napproves of the constitution which the state has formed. Its power\r\nof rejection, it is true, is limited to certain points. But upon\r\nthose points that power is absolute; and amongst them, without a\r\nshadow of doubt, is _slavery._ The state which, having accepted of a\r\nlimitation to its power in this respect, should presume to alter it,\r\nwould set that power at defiance.\r\n\r\nBut the restriction is INEXPEDIENT! And what is the amount of\r\ninexpediency? Some thousands of dollars less to the public\r\nrevenue--some hundreds of thousands less in the sale of public\r\nlands! Forbid it, Justice! forbid it, the Genius of the\r\nConstitution! that we should barter our free inheritance for a\r\nmess of pottage; that the countrymen of Washington should coolly\r\ncalculate the profits of a desertion of principle. But not only is\r\nthe restriction not inexpedient, it is called for by the clearest\r\ndictates of sound policy. We are now entering upon a region of\r\nalmost boundless extent and fertility, destined at some future day\r\nto be the abode of millions of human beings. Upon the decision of\r\nthe present question, in all probability, will it depend, whether\r\nthat population will be a free and industrious race, or whether the\r\ngreat majority will be bound in the chains of slavery, stinting the\r\ngrowth and paralyzing the energies of the community.\r\n\r\nIf it be fairly decided that slavery shall not exist to the west\r\nof the Mississippi, we shall soon see the rich vallies of that\r\nterritory occupied by industrious farmers, proving what is no doubt\r\nthe fact, that freemen can cultivate the staple commodities of\r\nthat country more advantageously than slaves. Let us for a moment\r\ncontrast the opposite pictures which are here presented.\r\n\r\nThe privileged order of the southern states have, it is true, every\r\ntemporal blessing they can desire, save that of security. But their\r\nhordes of slaves--a million of labourers, chained down to cheerless\r\nand incessant toil, shrouded in utter intellectual darkness, cut off\r\nfrom all that ennobles and adorns existence, stationary amidst the\r\ngeneral march of improvement, and sold and driven about like herds\r\nof cattle;--is there not in this picture, retouch it and soften it\r\nas you may, subject for bitter regret? and is there nothing to cheer\r\nthe heart of the patriot in the reverse? A country studded with\r\nvillages and farms; a smiling and contented population; intelligent,\r\nvirtuous, and industrious, and the strength and the pride of the\r\nnation, and becoming in its turn the hive for fresh swarms of\r\nemigrants. This is no exaggerated or romantic representation. These\r\nopposite conditions exist in our country; and Congress have now to\r\ndecide which of them shall give its features to the western valley\r\nof the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nBut it is from motives of humanity and security, say some, that\r\nwe plead the extension of slavery. The evil will thus be diluted\r\nand lessened. Admirable politicians! profound economists! A\r\npoisonous plant has overgrown one of your fields, and you seek to\r\nextirpate it by spreading the seeds throughout your possessions! A\r\nconcealed fire is smouldering in your house, and you would prevent\r\nits conflagration by scattering the embers upon your neighbours'\r\ndwellings!\r\n\r\nIt is not thus that slavery is to be mitigated or done away. Confine\r\nslavery within its present limits, and we may then hope to see it\r\nextinguished. We are young, and may outgrow it. There is a great\r\nbody of active and enlightened philanthropy in the southern states;\r\nand it may yet devise means for its extinction. Build around it a\r\ncircumvallation of freemen, and you render impotent its fearful\r\nthreatenings. But give to it that principle of indefinite increase\r\nwhich our white population derives from the inexhaustible extent\r\nof our country, and you spread it over the face of the Union; you\r\nclothe it a hundred fold with terrors; you render it coeval with our\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nBut not only this. The slave trade from Africa to the United States\r\nwill never be abolished, if we allow of slavery to the west of the\r\nMississippi. So great will be the value of slaves along the rich\r\nbottoms of that territory, that no laws, however severe, can put a\r\nstop to their importation. That accursed traffic is even now carried\r\non with impunity, and to an incredible extent. Fifteen thousand\r\nvictims have been worse than immolated at its shrine within a single\r\nyear. With greater temptations to engage in it, in more remote\r\nsituations, and along an unguarded frontier, no human power can\r\naltogether check it.\r\n\r\nNor will it be merely a foreign slave trade that this extension will\r\nencourage. An internal traffic will take place. The poorer and more\r\nhealthy states will become the breeders for the new and unhealthy\r\ndistricts; and it will happen as it has ever done, that the pursuit\r\nof a trade, wicked and cruel in itself, will entail the commission\r\nof crimes, the violation of every moral law, _the begetting of\r\noffspring for the purposes of an unholy traffic_. A deadly taint\r\nwill spread over the morals and character of our country, which\r\nnot all our professions of liberty can purify; and if there be any\r\nprophecy in history, the rights of these long degraded beings will\r\none day be vindicated with awful retribution.\r\n\r\nI have treated this subject with warmth; with more warmth, perhaps,\r\nthan has served my cause. But I cannot think without indignation of\r\nthe attempt which is now making to extend the empire of slavery--a\r\ndespotism in the bosom of a republic; and which I believe to be\r\npregnant with the most disastrous consequences. It is necessary that\r\nthe public mind should be kept awake on the subject; and I cannot\r\nrefrain from lifting up my feeble voice on the occasion.\r\n\r\nOne word more, and I have done. The division in Congress upon\r\nthis subject, has been truly called a geographical division. The\r\nmembers from the south, with scarcely an exception, voted for the\r\nintroduction of slaves. Yet from the same quarter do we hear of\r\nsplendid schemes for colonization and emancipation, for eradicating\r\nslavery, and pouring the light of civilization and religion upon\r\nravaged and benighted Africa. Many of the most conspicuous actors in\r\nthis great scheme of benevolence, are the men who have exerted all\r\ntheir talents upon the floor of Congress to increase the evils over\r\nwhich in another place they mourn; to sink us still deeper in the\r\ndangers into which they have confessed we are plunged.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to think, Gentlemen, of the purity of your motives,\r\nor the sincerity of your professions? Is it that your fears, and\r\nnot your benevolence, impel you; that you wish to rid yourselves\r\nof the free blacks, and rivet and extend your dominion over the\r\nslaves? If these imputations are false, show yourselves at least\r\nto be consistent. Do not by your own act extend the evils you so\r\neloquently regret. Give us that proof of the sincerity of your\r\nbenevolence (the only one we can believe) that it is stronger than\r\nyour sense of private interest. Prove to us that you are honestly\r\nbent upon exterminating slavery, and there are thousands who now\r\nstand aloof, that will join you with all their strength in any\r\nscheme that can effect it; thousands, whose daily prayer is, that\r\nthe mercy of an all-just Providence may avert from our country the\r\ncalamities of a servile war and a divided empire.\r\n\r\nWe ask of you no extravagant or impracticable scheme of\r\nemancipation; We do not wish to see your Helots invested suddenly\r\nwith privileges which they would only abuse; nor do we look _for\r\nyour relief and theirs_, to any other means than those which time\r\nand cautious experience may suggest. But we beseech you, as you are\r\nsincere in your plans of colonization, as you value the fair fame of\r\nour common country, as you regard the security and prosperity of all\r\nfuture generations--to stay the plague of slavery from spreading,\r\nand to give to the inhabitants of the Missouri a charter which shall\r\nnot disgrace the great principles of our revolution, nor _allow man\r\nto be the tyrant of his fellow man_.\r\n\r\n  SANDIFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILIAR LETTERS\r\n\r\n_From an Englishman in this country to his Friend at home_.\r\n\r\n(Communicated for the Rural Magazine.)\r\n\r\nNo. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PHILADELPHIA, _Sept_. 8, 1819.\r\n\r\nMy dear G.--You will perhaps be surprised at my dating this letter\r\nfrom this place, but I shall shortly explain to you the reason. We\r\narrived in perfect safety at Baltimore on the 6th inst., after a\r\nvery pleasant passage; not unusually short, but rendered exceedingly\r\n_comfortable_ (that dear English word, although they have here\r\nnaturalised it, as they do almost everything that comes from us,)\r\nby the kind, social, and attentive manners of Capt. ----. To\r\ngive you a detail of all the circumstances of our voyage would\r\nbe unnecessary. I do not wish to nauseate you with the revolting\r\nparticulars of a landsman's initiation to the ocean. We had not\r\nthat humiliation to undergo which would have been our lot if the\r\nequinoctial had unfortunately crossed our path; but we had enough\r\nto inspire us with a perfect sense of our own inferiority to, and\r\ndependence on that Power that can rule the winds and the waves.\r\nHowever, our dear Mrs. and Miss ---- were so much affected by the\r\nmotion of the ship, and other associations, that we enjoyed very\r\nlittle of their company. The first appearance of land, even that\r\nland, which since my recollection has been supposed to be inhabited\r\nby spirits, hostile in late, although similar in early habits to\r\nourselves, was greeted with most sincere satisfaction. That land was\r\ninhabited by Christians, by men like ourselves, derived from the\r\nsame origin, boasting of equal laws adopted from our code in general\r\nprinciples, and operating like our own upon freemen. We were landed\r\nin consequence of an unfavourable wind, at Norfolk; where, although\r\nwe staid but a few minutes, I was sorrowfully convinced that all the\r\ninhabitants of the land I was visiting were not freemen.\r\n\r\nA public sale of blacks was about to take place, and my first\r\nintroduction to the country I had so joyfully pictured, was\r\nassociated with feelings to which I had till then been a stranger.\r\nPoor wretches, thought I, as they passed badly clothed and manacled\r\nthrough the streets, you give an alien a strange idea of the\r\nconsistency of your rulers, and a lamentable evidence of the truth\r\nof the political axiom, that those who feel power, forget right. As\r\nI shall probably visit Norfolk in common with the other maritime\r\ntowns of Virginia, before I return, sufficient interest has been\r\nexcited in my mind to enable me to assure you, that I shall give you\r\nfurther details of the situation of that unfortunate class of human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nFrom Norfolk our voyage to Baltimore surpassed all my former ideas\r\nof rapidity. We passed up to Baltimore in so short a space of time,\r\nand in _such_ a steam-boat, that I dread your incredulity were I to\r\ngive you particulars. Let it suffice that _but a few hours_ brought\r\nus to Baltimore, reputed to be in commercial importance the fourth\r\ncity in the Union. You know it was my first object to visit the\r\nrespectable gentlemen in this place to to whom I have letters, and\r\nmost of whom have at one time or another done business with our\r\nhouse. But on the instant of my arrival I was utterly confounded by\r\nthe intelligence that the yellow fever, that scourge of America,\r\nand so justly dreaded by all Europeans, but more particularly by\r\nthe inhabitants of northern climates, had made its appearance at\r\na place called Fell's Point, either in the vicinity of the city,\r\nor forming one of the suburbs; I was in too much consternation to\r\nlearn which. Indeed I was so much annoyed by the continual reports\r\nof the _yellow fever_ at _the Point_, and what they called the _bank\r\nfever_ in the city, that I could hardly tell where I was, or what\r\nI was to do.--Luckily, a very good looking gentleman, seeing my\r\nperplexity, and imagining--for I cannot tell how else he happened\r\nto fix upon me--that I was an Englishman, told me that I could not\r\nget out of the city of Baltimore too soon, because it had had the\r\ncurse of Cain upon it ever since the celebrated mob business (that\r\nwe heard our Maryland friend R. speak about) some years ago, that it\r\nhad the plague at the Point, and the yellow or white fever, he did\r\nnot care which, at the other end of the town. This would have been\r\nnews almost enough to frighten our lamented friend General R. (if he\r\never could have known fear;) and instead of visiting the spot where\r\nhe terminated his brief career in this world, which I intended to\r\nhave done on the moment of my landing, as performing the last pious\r\nact of duty to his memory that affection demanded, I determined to\r\nfly from this new enemy with almost as much precipitation as the\r\nYankees (by _our_ official accounts) fled from our departed hero\r\nin his various incursions in the states, adjoining the waters of\r\nthe Chesapeake. I ordered a post chaise _instanter_. The servant\r\nreplied, \"it went before day, sir.\" Is it possible, said I, that\r\nat a house frequented as this is, (Mr. G's.) there is but one post\r\nchaise. Get me one at any rate, I returned in a pretty quick tone,\r\nand have my baggage put to it immediately. \"Why, master,\" rejoined\r\nGeorge, (I thought the better of him for his name, and perhaps,\r\nnovice as I am, because he was black) \"there is no other post chaise\r\ntill to-morrow; but the steam-boat will go at five o'clock, master,\r\nif that will suit you.\" It wanted but a few minutes of that hour. I\r\nleaped into a hackney coach, (which by the way I was surprised to\r\nsee in such a new country, unless it had been moved by steam) and\r\nere the hour had struck, was safe on board a very commodious vessel,\r\nfurnished with every thing to make a night passage pleasant.\r\n\r\nIt is upwards of one hundred miles from Baltimore to Philadelphia,\r\nby land, even by their lately improved roads; yet, with no\r\ninterruption except being transported some sixteen or twenty miles\r\nover good roads, in very bad stage coaches, we enjoyed ourselves in\r\nour births till I was awakened before nine the next morning, by the\r\nsteward, who informed me we were at the wharf, in the place of our\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nI forthwith repaired, as my previous instructions directed, to the\r\nlarge and commodious hotel of Mr. R.; where I met with several of my\r\nold friends, and some quondam fellow-voyagers, who, influenced by\r\nbusiness, or perhaps the same instinctive dread of yellow fever with\r\nmyself, had found their way to this city.--Here, my dear W., I still\r\nremain. In the twenty-four hours that have scarcely elapsed since my\r\narrival, I have seen nothing distinctly; for after the monotony of\r\na sea voyage, and the dizziness consequent on an exchange from the\r\nocean to _terra firma_, some few days must be allotted to repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treatise on Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\nOn the Rise and Progress of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of this art is lost among the fables of antiquity, and\r\nwe have to regret, that in the present state of knowledge, we\r\nare even ignorant of the _time_, when the plough was invented,\r\nand of the _name_ and _condition_ of the inventor. When therefore\r\nwe speak of the beginning of the art, we but allude to certain\r\nappearances which indicate its existence, and the employment given\r\nby it to the minds, as well as to the hands, of mankind. Such were\r\nthe artificial canals and lakes of Egypt. Menaced at one time by a\r\nredundancy of water, and at another by its scarcity or want, the\r\ngenius of that extraordinary people could not but employ itself,\r\npromptly and strenuously, in remedying these evils, and eventually,\r\nin converting them into benefits; and hence it was, that when other\r\nparts of the world exhibited little more of agricultural knowledge\r\nthan appertains to the state of nature, imagined by philosophers,\r\nthe Egyptians thoroughly understood and skilfully practised\r\n_irrigation_, that most scientific and profitable branch of the\r\nart.[1] Like their own Nile, their population had its overflow,\r\nwhich colonized Carthage and Greece, and carried with it the talent\r\nand intelligence of the mother country. The former of these states,\r\nthough essentially commercial, had its _plantations_, and so highly\r\nprized were the agricultural works of Mago, that when Carthage was\r\ncaptured, they alone, of the many books found in it, were retained\r\nand translated by the Romans. A similar inference may be drawn from\r\nthe history of Greece; for assuredly that art could not have been\r\neither unknown or neglected, which so long employed the pen and\r\nthe tongue of the great Xenophon.[2] It must however be admitted,\r\nthat of the ancient nations, it is only among the Romans, that we\r\nfind real and multiplied evidences of the progress of the art;\r\n_facts_, substituted for _conjectures_ and _inferences_. Cato,\r\nVarro, Columella, Virgil and Pliny, wrote on the subject, and it is\r\nfrom their works we derive the following brief exposition of Roman\r\nhusbandry.\r\n\r\n[1] The best practical illustration of this opinion is found in the\r\nvalley of the Po--where \"every rood of earth maintains its man.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Xenophon wrote several treatises on husbandry, and gave public\r\nlectures on it at Scillonte, whither a weak and wicked government\r\nhad banished him.\r\n\r\nThe plough, the great instrument of agricultural labour, was well\r\nknown and generally used among them; it was drawn exclusively by\r\nhorned cattle. Of fossile _manures_, we know that they used _lime_,\r\nand probably _marle_,[3] and that those of animal and vegetable\r\nbasis, were carefully collected. Attention to this subject, even\r\nmade part of the national religion; the dunghill had its god,\r\nand Stercutus, his temple and worshippers. Their corn crops were\r\nabundant; besides _barley_ and _far_,[4] they had three species\r\nof _wheat_; the _robus_ or red--the _siligo_ or white--and the\r\n_triticum trimestre_, or summer wheat; they had besides millet,\r\npanis, zea (Indian corn) and rye, all of which producing a\r\nflour convertible into bread, were known by the common name of\r\n_frumentum_. Leguminous crops were frequent; the lupin in particular\r\nwas raised in abundance, and besides being employed as a manure,[5]\r\nentered extensively into the subsistence of men, cattle and\r\npoultry. The cultivation of garden vegetables was well understood\r\nand employed many hands; and meadows, natural and artificial,\r\nwere brought to great perfection. Lucern and fenugrec were the\r\nbasis of the latter, and peas, rye and a mixture of barley, beans\r\nand peas, called _farrago_, were occasionally used in the stables\r\nas green food. Their flocks were abundant, and formed their first\r\nrepresentatives of wealth, as is sufficiently indicated by their\r\nword _pecunia_. Vines and olives, and their products (wine and oil)\r\nhad a full share of attention and use. The rearing of poultry made\r\nan important part of domestic economy, nor were apiaries and fish\r\nponds forgotten or neglected.\r\n\r\n[3] For the first part of this assertion we have the authority of\r\nPliny; for the latter, the practice of their colonies both in Gaul\r\nand Britain.\r\n\r\n[4] Of this last, there were three kinds, neither of which is now\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n[5] The lupinus albus of Linneus: \"many other vegetables are used\r\nfor this purpose, particularly the _bean_, but do not answer as well\r\nas the _lupin_; when this is heated in an oven and then buried, it\r\nforms the most powerful of all manures.\" T. C. L. Simonde. _Tableau\r\nde L'agriculture Toscane_.\r\n\r\nIf we pause for a moment, to glance at the civil institutions of\r\nthis wonderful people, we discover how soon and how deeply it\r\nentered into their policy, not merely to promote, but to dignify\r\nagriculture and its professors.[6] When Cicero said, that \"nothing\r\nin this world was better, more useful, more agreeable, more worthy\r\nof a free man, than agriculture;\"[7] he pronounced, not merely\r\nhis own opinion, but the public judgment of his age and nation.\r\nWere troops to be raised for the defence of the republic? The\r\n_tribus rusticus_ was the privileged nursery of the legions![8] Did\r\nexigencies of state require a general or dictator? he was taken from\r\nthe _plough_! Were his services rewarded? this was done not with\r\nribbands or gold, but by a donation of _land_.[9]\r\n\r\n[6] Tanus and Numa were deified for services rendered to agriculture.\r\n\r\n[7] Cicero de officiis. L. 2.\r\n\r\n[8] This continued till the time of Marius.\r\n\r\n[9] As much as he could plough in a day.\r\n\r\nWith such support from public opinion, it was not to be supposed\r\nthat the laws would be either adverse or indifferent to this branch\r\nof industry. We accordingly find the utmost security given to\r\nthe labours of the husbandman;[10] no legislative interposition\r\nbetween the seller and buyer, neither forced sales--nor limitation\r\nof prices--and a sacredness of boundaries never disturbed;[11]\r\nfairs and markets multiplied and protected against invasion or\r\ninterruption,[12] and highways leading to these every where\r\nestablished, and of a character to call forth benedictions and\r\nadmiration.[13]\r\n\r\n[10] To cut or destroy in the night the crop of his neighbour,\r\nsubjected the Roman to death.\r\n\r\n[11] Terminus was among their gods.\r\n\r\n[12] Assemblies of the people on days designated for fairs, and on\r\nsubjects other than those of trade, were not lawful.\r\n\r\n[13] The Appian way, yet remains the wonder and reproach of modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nNor were these regulations confined to the proper territory of Rome.\r\nWhat of her own policy was good, she communicated to her neighbours;\r\nwhat of theirs was better, she adopted and practised herself. Her\r\narts and arms were therefore constant companions. Wherever her\r\nlegions marched, her knowledge, practices, and implements followed;\r\nand it is to these we are to look for the foundation of modern\r\nagriculture in Italy, France, Spain, &c. _[Albany Argus_.\r\n\r\n(To be continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Moral Plough Boy_.\r\n\r\n     \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not\r\n     thine hand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words of our motto were probably addressed by an Eastern monarch\r\nto those of his subjects, who followed husbandry, and to whom the\r\nimportance of early rising was the greater, as the climate was\r\nexcessively warm, and the stoutest labourer found the noon-tide\r\nheat too powerful for the energies of his frame to encounter.--This\r\nis the case in most of the oriental climes, where the morning and\r\nthe evening are improved by the cultivator of the soil, as well as\r\nthe man of business of every class, cast or profession.--The middle\r\nor hottest part of the day is, in those countries, given to ease\r\nand relaxation; and the charms of conversation, and the sweets of\r\nrefreshment, are then the substitutes for toil and care.\r\n\r\nBut the time thus spent is not lost, because they attend strictly to\r\nthe advice of the sacred moralist, and make it up by the fidelity\r\nof their morning and evening labours in the field, the workship or\r\nthe counting-room. Besides the earth is there more prolific than\r\nin colder climes, like ours, and to less labour yields a greater\r\nsupply, a more abundant harvest.\r\n\r\nBut abundantly as the earth yields her products, beneath an oriental\r\nsky, still it was there that man was first taught by his Maker,\r\nthat she would not yield them without the sweat of the human brow.\r\nImplicit obedience was the first law given to our progenitors in\r\nEden, as the condition of enjoying life without labour, of being\r\nsurrounded by the perpetual verdure of spring, and regaled by\r\nthe never-dying fragrance of its odours: But this fair condition\r\nviolated, and they were doomed to know, that fruitful as the earth\r\nhad come from the hands of its Creator, they should cultivate it\r\nwith toil, and care, and anxiety, before it should yield them the\r\nmeans of enjoyment and subsistence. But for one fatal mistake, they\r\nwould never have been called upon to sow their seed in the morning,\r\nand at evening to watch over it with a careful hand.\r\n\r\nWe have seen then, that the first Plough Boys were obliged to work\r\nearly and late; and their successors in the same climes, are still\r\nsubjected to the same diurnal labour.\r\n\r\nBut the American Plough Boy enjoys a milder clime, and may perhaps\r\nthink himself less obliged to rise with the dawn of day, or pursue\r\nhis labours with the declining sun. He may perhaps flatter himself\r\nthat the morning may be spent at a neighbouring bar-room, and the\r\nevening at a shooting-match or a horse-race, and the day still\r\nafford time enough for all the labour that he may have to perform.\r\nBut this is, indeed, an error the most fatal to his present, as well\r\nas future happiness. The mid-day beams of the sun are not so fierce\r\non the hills or vales of America, as on the plains of Asia, where\r\nour first parents were doomed to earn their bread by the sweat of\r\ntheir brow. But they are still fierce enough to make the PLOUGH BOY\r\nfeel their enervating effects, and to impress upon his physical as\r\nwell as mental frame the necessity and importance of _sowing his\r\nseed in the morning_, and of extending to it the _vigilance of his\r\nhand in the evening_.\r\n\r\nIf our American Plough Boys would, one and all, adopt with energy\r\nand perseverance this injunction of oriental wisdom, how different\r\nwould be the face of our country, in many places, from what it now\r\nis! How many orchards would be planted; how many fruit trees, of\r\nevery kind, would be seen growing in beauty and luxuriance, where\r\nnow the eye of the traveller, or sojourner, is obliged to rest upon\r\nnought but wilds and weeds? How many fields would be ploughed and\r\nsown, and cultivated with success, which now lie waste, and barren\r\nas the deserts of Arabia. How many cattle, and domestic animals of\r\nevery description, fit for the use of man, would be seen thriving\r\nand healthy, awaiting a profitable market, where now there are none,\r\nor those whose sickly and squalid appearance, bespeaks the indolence\r\nand neglect of their owners! How many substantial rail fences would\r\nbe erected, where there is now scarcely a brush bulwark against the\r\nencroachments of man or beast? How many neat stone walls would take\r\nthe place of rail fences, and remain as lasting monuments of the\r\nvirtue of their owners--for _industry_ and _virtue_ are synonimous\r\nin agricultural life! How many ditches would be seen running through\r\nour swamps, and yielding or restoring to wholesome vegetation, those\r\nnurseries of wild, unprofitable, and poisonous plants; whose dark,\r\ndamp shades are not only lost to agriculture; but send forth daily\r\ntheir pestilential vapours, spreading disease and death among the\r\nPlough Boys!\r\n\r\nIt is not the industrious Plough Boy who will feel the application\r\nof these remarks. He will take care that his fields and his fences,\r\nhis flourishing fruit-trees, his overflowing cribs and barns, and\r\nhis fat cattle, plump and smooth as a turtle-fed alderman, shall\r\nprove to the world that he never fails to attend to the admonition\r\nof our motto.\r\n\r\nBut it is to the slothful that this short essay is addressed. Pluck\r\nup the weeds, and the useful plants will take care of themselves.\r\nReform the indolent, and the industrious will find a new spur to\r\nexertion. Ye careless and slothful Plough Boys, then, be advised by\r\na friend. Cast off the sin of idleness, which so easily besets you,\r\nand imitate your industrious neighbours. Resolve for the future,\r\n_in the morning to sow your seed, and in the evening to withhold\r\nnot your hand_; and you will soon find, that the blessings of\r\nHeaven await those who deserve them; and that health, prosperity,\r\nand a quiet conscience, are the never-failing rewards of virtuous\r\nindustry. H. H. Jr. _[Plough Boy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Nicholson's Prize Essay.\r\n\r\n_On a Rotation of Crops, and the most profitable mode of collecting,\r\npreserving, and applying Manures_.\r\n\r\n(Communicated to the Albany County Agricultural Society.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome soils are peculiarly adapted for the growth of particular\r\nplants, and in such case many successive yearly growths of them\r\nmay be raised, without manure, and without material diminution\r\nof product. We have known an instance of 14 good crops of wheat\r\nraised successively on the same ground; another of 18 crops of\r\noats; others of at least 10 of barley, and nearly of 20 rye: But\r\nthese were peculiar soils; and although this sameness of culture\r\nwas found successful, no inference is therefore to be drawn that it\r\nwas the most profitable, or that such soils would not eventually\r\ntire of their favourite crops, and then be found exhausted and\r\nunfit for others. Generally speaking, we conceive that one of the\r\nmost important points in husbandry is a judicious rotation of such\r\ncrops as are most profitable for culture, and at the same time best\r\nadapted for the particular soils which are to be cultivated. Lands\r\nseem naturally to require a change of growths. Where the oak has\r\ndisappeared, after it had lifted its head to the springs of ages,\r\nanother oak will not naturally rise, but some other tree. Instances\r\nhave been known of lands covered solely with trees of deciduous\r\ngrowth, where the knots of the pitch pine were still to be found;\r\na proof that pine was once a tenant of the soil. In the southern\r\nstates, where lands have been exhausted with injudicious cropping,\r\nand then thrown out to common, they soon become covered with growths\r\nof trees different from those they originally bore. Some plants are\r\nso unfit for long continuance in any particular place that they are\r\nendowed with migratory powers, either by their winged seeds, which\r\nare wafted abroad by the winds; by their roots, by which they change\r\ntheir places of growth beneath the surface; or by their vines,\r\nby which they travel above ground, and thus locate themselves in\r\ndifferent situations. Of the first description are the varieties\r\nof the thistle, the milk-weed, and the fire-weed; of the second,\r\nthe potato and some other bulbous rooted plants; of the third, the\r\nstraw-berry, the black-berry, the different species of the gourd\r\ntribe. The stalks of erect plants fall when they ripen, and thus\r\nthe seed reaches the ground at a distance from the roots which\r\nproduced them. There seems, indeed, to be generally a disposition\r\nin the earth to require changes in the plants it nourishes, in order\r\nthat it may impart the food that is best adapted for each; and\r\nProvidence, in his infinite wisdom, has endowed these while growing\r\nin a state of nature, with such properties as are best calculated to\r\neffect the changes. Let the cultivator, therefore, study nature, and\r\nfollow her dictates, if he wishes either success or applause in his\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nIn regard to changes of crops, a general rule has been recommended\r\nof alternate growths of leguminous and culmiferous kinds, and of\r\ngreen crops and grain crops; but perhaps it would be quite as\r\nphilosophical to insist upon alternate growths of fibrous, and\r\ntap-rooted plants; the former deriving their food from the surface\r\nof the earth, the latter from greater depths. But the value of\r\ncrops, and the expense of raising each, should be duly estimated in\r\nmaking selections for rotations. Let us say, for instance, that the\r\naverage crops of wheat, barley, and Indian corn, at their greatest\r\nextent, may average 50 dollars in value to the acre, after the grain\r\nis ready for market; crops of rye, oats and peas, not more than two\r\nthirds of this amount; buck-wheat, considerably less. From lands\r\nsuitable for ruta baga, or mangel wurzel, it would seem that from\r\nfive to six hundred bushels to the acre may be expected with good\r\nculture; which at 18 cents per bushel, a price certainly not beyond\r\nthe proportionate value we have just given to the grain crops, will\r\naverage about a hundred dollars to the value of an acre. The entire\r\nexpense of either of these crops of roots, when ready for use, is\r\nnot essentially greater than the expense incurred in producing grain\r\ncrops; of course, it must be evident that these afford from 30 to 50\r\ndollars an acre less of clear profit than a crop of either of the\r\nroots first mentioned. With a proper application of the requisite\r\nquantity of manure to ruta baga, it may be successfully grown on\r\nalmost any dry soil, when well and deeply mellowed, from the sandy\r\nto the deep rich loams. Soils of the latter description are best\r\nadapted for mangle wurzel. Either of these roots, when steam boiled,\r\nand especially with the addition of some meal, will answer all the\r\npurposes for which grain is used for feeding cattle of all sorts,\r\nfrom the horse down to the hog. Even stage horses, which, from the\r\nseverity of their labour, require the most nourishing food, have\r\nbeen kept in England on hay and steam-boiled ruta baga. Mr. Cobbett\r\nsays, \"a hog of a good sort may be sufficiently fatted with this\r\nroot when steam-boiled.\" Allowing, what we believe can hardly be\r\nadmitted, that a bushel of oats contains as much nutriment as three\r\nof this root, still it is evident that the usual product of one acre\r\nof it will go as far in keeping horses as four of oats. Neither of\r\nthese root crops require any considerable expenditure in seed, and\r\non this account, if on no other, they are preferable to crops of the\r\npotato and of the Jerusalem artichoke, which in the article of seed\r\nare perhaps the most expensive of any whatever. We however consider\r\ncrops even of these roots more profitable than those of grain, and\r\nparticularly the potato, when judiciously cultivated in climates\r\nmost suitable for its growth. For the various uses of this root\r\nfor culinary purposes it stands indeed without a rival. In point\r\nof profit we would also give to the carrot, the parsnip, and the\r\nonion, a preference to crops of grain; but the soils well adapted\r\nfor them is more limited, and their culture is more expensive;\r\nand although they should form a part of the products of the farm\r\nwe cannot recommend them as being in all instances proper for a\r\njudicious rotation of crops. The common turnip, and the cabbage, are\r\nalso entitled to attention. The pumpkin is as nutritious as the\r\nsame weight of any root or vegetable whatever, and its culture is\r\ncheap; but whether its product, in weight, can be made to compete\r\nwith that of roots, is a matter of which we are not informed. If 15\r\ntons to the acre could be usually obtained of this species of gourd,\r\nwe should be induced to pronounce the crop, in point of profit and\r\nuse, unrivalled as a preparative for a crop of winter grain. The\r\ncrop would be found among those which are least expensive in seed,\r\nin culture and in gathering; none would occasion less exhaustion of\r\nsoil, nor require less for manure, as a little gypsum to the hills,\r\nor drills, will be found to have a powerful effect on its growth,\r\nbut of its more complete cultivation we shall presently speak.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania, and farther to the south, a successful mode of\r\nculture has been put in practice of growing Indian corn and potatoes\r\nin alternate rows or drills, and in this way about a sixth more of\r\nproduct in the aggregate, is obtained from the ground, than if these\r\ntwo sorts of crops were cultivated separately. Such is found to be\r\nthe fact, and the reason for it seems to be that each crop has, in\r\nthis way, more space given for the extension of its roots in search\r\nof its favourite food, and each has the like room above ground\r\nfor deriving from the air the nutriment that is most suitable.\r\nCorn, in particular, it is well known, is liable to much injury,\r\nif planted too closely. There is, indeed, a variety of cases where\r\nthis mingling of growths is found very advantageous, and whenever\r\nwe shall venture to recommend the practice, it will be founded on a\r\nconviction of its utility. There are also some instances, even in\r\nthis northern latitude, in which two crops may be had in a season\r\nfrom the same ground, and any case where it may be advisable shall\r\nbe duly noted.\r\n\r\nIt should farther be observed that in suggesting what may be deemed\r\nthe most suitable changes of crops, no reference will be had to\r\nthe actual state of farming among us, but merely what the state of\r\nfarming ought to be; and in pursuance of this course, we shall,\r\nin a great measure, discard the idea, too long prevalent in this\r\ncountry, that we should make the most of our labour, not the most\r\nof our land; we shall, on the contrary, insist that, generally\r\nspeaking, making the most of our lands, under a proper course of\r\nhusbandry, is the right way to realize the most from our labour. We\r\nshall therefore begin with the most usual soil of this country, the\r\ndry, arable lands, which are usually suited for a variety of crops.\r\nOf the stiff clays, the hard gravels, and light sands, soils which\r\nabound but little here, we shall speak in particular. In ploughing\r\nwe shall advise that the usual depth be about six inches, or about\r\na third deeper than our farmers commonly plough: but that the depth\r\nshould sometimes be greater than this, and sometimes less. We\r\nshall also insist on the ploughing being done in the most perfect\r\nmanner, and not in the slight way too often practised; and we shall\r\nfarther premise that the plan of culture we recommend is necessarily\r\nconnected with the business of the dairy, to greater or less extent,\r\nand with that of the grazier, in feeding and fatting cattle of every\r\ndescription. Such we conceive to be the only true and profitable\r\ncourse to conduct farming in this country, but deviations from\r\nthis may in some cases be found equally profitable. In general,\r\nhowever, we advise to this course of farming, for in this way the\r\ngreatest quantity of manure is afforded, and for most lands manure\r\nis essential for obtaining the greatest crops, and of course for\r\nrealizing the greatest profits.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin with the ground in wheat or rye stubble, as at the\r\nend of our course we propose to leave it. Let the stubble ground be\r\nwell turned over in the fall, to the depth of, say, six inches. It\r\nshould not be turned over until a sward of white clover has covered\r\nthe ground, which is to be produced by giving it a top-dressing of\r\ngypsum, in the spring. Under the subject of manures the reasons for\r\nthis will be explained, when treating of gypsum. In the spring give\r\nthe ground one or two ploughings more, as the nature of the soil\r\nmay require, and of the same depth, and let the last ploughing be\r\njust before the proper time for planting Indian corn; for this crop,\r\nwith an intermixture of other plants, is what we propose to begin\r\nwith. Say, for instance, that the intermixture shall consist of the\r\npotato, of the pumpkin, and of the common pumpkin, a third part of\r\neach. We propose planting these crops in drills, in preference to\r\nhills, from a well founded conviction that in the former method\r\nconsiderably more may be obtained from the ground. Let furrows be\r\nrun, at a good depth, for the drills, at the distance of about every\r\nthree and a half feet. In these furrows lay off the shortest and\r\nbest of the fresh barn dung, at the rate of about 20 wagon loads\r\nto the acre. For the drills intended for potatoes the longer sort\r\nof barn dung is as good as any other. If the different sorts of\r\nbarn dung can be applied to the soils most suitable for each, as is\r\nmentioned in speaking of manures; this should always be attended to;\r\nthat is, sheep and horse dung for the moister parts of the land, and\r\ncow dung for the drier. As fast as the dung is laid, it should be\r\nwell covered, by a furrow, moderately deep, thrown over it from each\r\nside; but where potatoes are to form the alternate drills, let the\r\nseed for these be laid on the dung, previous to covering; and for\r\nthis purpose, let the potatoes be cut in halves, lengthways, so as\r\nto give each about an equal number of eyes, and then wet them and\r\nroll them in gypsum before laying them down, which should be at the\r\ndistances of about 15 inches. The potato drills being thus covered,\r\nby the furrows thrown from each side, the same process serves to\r\ncover the dung in the other furrows, and thus the beds are formed\r\nfor planting the other crops in the drill method. Indian corn may\r\nbe drilled in at one operation by a drill machine for the purpose;\r\nthe same may be observed of the turnip crop, and probably of the\r\npumpkin; but though attended with more labour, it may usually be\r\nexpected that they will be drilled in by manual operation. We should\r\nadvise that the seed in the turnip drills be liberally strewn, in\r\norder that if part of the plants be destroyed by the flies, enough\r\nmay still be left. The corn and pumpkin seed may be dropped at the\r\ndistances of six inches, and thinned at the first hoeing, so as\r\nto have the growing plants of the former about a foot apart, and\r\nthe latter about 16 inches. If any vacant places should happen in\r\nany of these drills, such vacancies may readily be supplied by\r\ntransplanting sets, taken from parts where more plants are standing\r\nthan are necessary. Any young plants may be transplanted after they\r\nhave attained a suitable size, which is usually in from two to four\r\nweeks growth. The vacancies may be quickly filled by transplanting,\r\nand it is a matter well worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nThe practice, lately introduced, of laying barn dung at a good\r\ndepth, and then covering it with mould to the depth of about three\r\nor four inches, and planting the seeds over the manure thus covered,\r\nseems to answer the best purpose for every drilled crop except\r\npotatoes, and we would therefore recommend this method of using barn\r\ndung in preference to every other, as far as it may be wanted for\r\ndrilled crops. In this way this manure may be profitably applied\r\nwhile fresh; but in many instances we consider it more efficacious\r\nwhen applied after the process of rotting or fermentation has\r\ncommenced. Such is the theory of Sir Humphrey Davy, and we have full\r\nconfidence in its correctness. When thus buried in the earth, the\r\ngrowing plants, placed above the manure, have the utmost means of\r\nabsorbing all its garious and soluble parts, while the process of\r\nits decomposition is going on.\r\n\r\nIn preparing seeds we would, as a general rule, advise to their\r\nbeing soaked about 12 hours in a strong solution of saltpetre, or\r\nof common salt, and then rolled in gypsum before being committed to\r\nthe earth. The effect of this mode of preparing the seed seems to\r\nbe, that the young plants start with more vigour, and grow larger\r\nthan they do where this treatment of the seed is neglected; and the\r\nsolution of saltpetre has the further effect of bringing plants to\r\nmaturity from one to two weeks sooner than they otherwise would\r\nripen.\r\n\r\nIn selecting seed for the corn crop, take such stalks as bear two\r\nears, and select the best ear from each of such stalks, the grains\r\non each end to be rejected. In all cases where it is practicable,\r\nthe seeds should be taken from the largest and most perfect plants,\r\nor roots, as the case may be. By attending to this mode of selecting\r\nseed the product of the corn crop in particular will soon be found\r\ngreatly augmented; a discovery, the honour of which is due to Mr.\r\nCooper, of New Jersey. It is said that sprinkling a little gypsum\r\non the silk of the ears of corn, will make them fill to the ends.\r\nNipping off the blossoms of the potato crop, as fast as they appear,\r\nis found, by accurate experiment, to increase the growth of the\r\nroots about one sixth part. Salt and gypsum have each a powerful\r\neffect on their growth, though by applying too much of the latter\r\nit may cause them to run too much to vines. To the corn and pumpkin\r\ncrop apply some of this latter manure after the plants are up. What\r\neffect it has on turnips we have never understood.\r\n\r\nIn ploughing between the drills let it be to a good depth, first\r\nturning the furrows from the plants, running about four inches from\r\nthem, and then turning the furrows back, when the hoeing and hand\r\nweeding are to follow. The second ploughing should be similar to\r\nthe first, but farther from the plants; and in general, we believe,\r\nit will be found advantageous to plough and hoe the crops the third\r\ntime. We have seen it highly recommended to plough among Indian\r\ncorn as late as in August. Frequent deep ploughing is certainly\r\nthe best means of keeping the ground moist, and should never be\r\nomitted in case of drought. Ground that has become quite dry will\r\nbe found moist after a thorough deep ploughing. At all events, the\r\nground should be so cultivated as to prevent any weeds from going to\r\nseed in the fall, for if this be suffered, the ground will remain\r\nconstantly stocked with the seeds of weeds.\r\n\r\nWe advise to the cultivation of the common turnip, the potato, and\r\nthe pumpkin, in the manner we have mentioned, for the purpose of\r\naffording the early supply of food for feeding and fatting cattle in\r\nthe fall and the forepart of the winter, before the ruta baga crop\r\nshould be used, of which we shall presently speak. We also advise to\r\nthis variety of crops, in order that the cattle may have a greater\r\nvariety of food, a matter of considerable importance in feeding and\r\nfatting cattle. For this purpose also the culture of the cabbage is\r\nworthy of attention. Horses, and all sorts of cattle, fatten well on\r\npumpkins, but for swine they should be steam boiled, and the seeds\r\ntaken out, as these prove injurious to those animals, by causing too\r\ngreat a secretion of urine. The seeds afford an oil equal to that of\r\nthe olive, and are well worth preserving for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ears of the corn crop have somewhat hardened, the\r\ncrop may be cut up and set in shocks, with the tops tied closely\r\ntogether to keep out the rains, in which way the grain will harden\r\nas well as in any other, and a great addition of fodder may thus be\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nDuring the next season we propose to take two crops from the ground,\r\nto wit, a crop of ruta baga, preceded by such spring crop as ripens\r\nsufficiently early to be harvested in time for preparing the ground\r\nfor a full growth of this root. In the meridian of New York, Mr.\r\nCobbett says that from the 26th of July until some of the first days\r\nin August, is the proper time to transplant this crop, the plants\r\nfor the purpose being previously grown. The method of cultivating\r\nthe crop by transplanting, he insists, is the preferable way, and\r\nfrom our own experience we are fully disposed to agree with him.\r\nAdvancing to the northward, from New York, the seasons are shorter,\r\nand of course the crop should be transplanted earlier, while at\r\nthe same time the spring crops are later in ripening. At New York,\r\nbarley could be taken from the ground in time sufficient for\r\npreparing for ruta baga; farther to the north this could not be the\r\ncase. In the more northerly parts of this state, it would, perhaps,\r\nbe difficult to find any crop, now raised in this country, with the\r\nexception of flax, that would be sufficiently early. The fact is, we\r\nwant a particular crop for this purpose; and that would seem to be\r\nthe new sort of spring wheat lately introduced into France, which\r\nis there called _le ble de Mai_, in English, the wheat of May. It\r\nis said to be a very productive species of wheat, affording a grain\r\nfrom which flour is made of about a medium whiteness between that\r\nof rye and wheat, and in that country it is fit to harvest in the\r\nlatter end of May. In this state it would probably ripen no where\r\nlater than the first of July, which would be in time sufficient\r\nfor the crop of ruta baga. Until we can procure this wheat, we can\r\nonly recommend that the preceding crop be such only as will ripen\r\nsufficiently early, and where none can be had for the purpose, to\r\nbe content with raising the crop of ruta baga only in the course of\r\nthe season. Where previous spring crops can however be obtained, let\r\nthem be taken from the ground as quick as possible, and the ground\r\ndeeply turned over, and mellowed by three deep ploughings, then\r\nfurrowed at the distances of about 30 inches, the manure laid in,\r\nand covered by furrows thrown over it from each side, and the plants\r\nof ruta baga immediately set on the ridges, by transplanting, at the\r\ndistance of about a foot from each other. From our own experience we\r\nare fully convinced that the plan of transplanting is, in the end,\r\nmuch the cheapest, and most advisable. We would, however, recommend\r\nnot to transplant before the appearance of a heavy shower, but at\r\nany time afterwards; that the plants be of good size, say of five\r\nor six weeks growth, and that in setting, special care be taken to\r\nhave the lower parts of the roots well enclosed with earth. For\r\nfurther particulars in regard to the culture of this crop, the time\r\nand manner of using it, and of saving it, we refer the reader to Mr.\r\nCobbett's book on the subject, from a conviction that it is the best\r\nessay that has ever been published on the culture and use of this\r\nvaluable plant.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, however, that we differ from Mr. C. in the\r\ndistances in which the plants are to be set, and in the manner of\r\nforming the ridges. He forms his ridges by four gathering furrows,\r\nby which the ridges are each about 4 feet in breadth. We propose to\r\nform the ridges by two gathering furrows, and at the distances of 30\r\ninches. In England, the plan we recommend is generally pursued, and\r\nthe ridges are usually but 27 inches wide.\r\n\r\n(To be continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM NILES' WEEKLY REGISTER.\r\n\r\n_Cotton, Rice, Tobacco, Sugar, Wine._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Intelligencer informs us that in New York 133 bushels\r\nof Indian corn have been gathered this year from _one acre_; and 714\r\nbushels of potatoes from one acre. This has led to the following\r\nstatistical facts.\r\n\r\nCOTTON.--In 1817 the export of cotton from the United States was\r\n(85,649,328_lbs._) more than eighty-five million. One acre yields,\r\nat a moderate estimate, 250lbs. of clean cotton. The whole export,\r\ntherefore, is the product of only 535 square miles: this is less\r\nthan the 108th part of Georgia, and less than the 520th part of the\r\ncotton regions of the U. States.\r\n\r\nRICE.--The maximum export of rice was 73,329 tierces, (in 1790,)\r\nor (43,997,400_lbs._) nearly forty-four million pounds. This, on\r\nan average crop, is the produce of only sixty-five square miles,\r\nwhich is less than the 440th part of South Carolina, and less than\r\ntwo-thirds of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO.--The maximum export of tobacco was 12,428 hogsheads, in\r\n1791. A hogshead is about one thousand weight; and, on average,\r\none acre will yield one hogshead. The export, therefore, was the\r\nproduct of about 176 square miles, which is less than the 363d part\r\nof Virginia. Each of the 97 counties of that state contains, on an\r\naverage, more than 659 square miles, viz: more than three times the\r\nquantity of land which furnished the above export.\r\n\r\nSUGAR.--Such is, generally, the fertility of the equinoctial regions\r\nof America, that all the sugar consumed in France, estimated at\r\ntwenty million kilogrammes, (about 54,000,000 pounds,) may be\r\nproduced on an extent of 7 square leagues, which is not equal to\r\none-thirtieth part of the smallest department of France.\r\n\r\nWINE.--About 1,600,000 arpents, or 1,350,400 acres, are in France\r\nemployed in the culture of the vine. The value of the annual product\r\nis about 100,800,000 dollars, at about twenty cents a gallon. In\r\n1790 Bordeaux alone exported more than fifteen million gallons of\r\nwine. The 1,600,000 arpents are less than one 80th part of France,\r\nand less than one 20th part of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe value of the annual produce of these five interesting articles,\r\nmay be thus estimated:\r\n\r\n  Cotton, at 15 cents,        $12,847,399\r\n  Rice, $20 a tierce,           1,466,580\r\n  Tobacco, $60 a hogshead,      6,745,680\r\n  Wine, 20 cents a gallon,    100,800,000\r\n  Sugar consumed in France,\r\n    at 10 cents a pound,        5,400,000\r\n                            -------------\r\n                             $127,259,659\r\n\r\nFor the product of these articles the following quantities of land\r\nare cultivated, viz.\r\n\r\n             Square miles.\r\n  For cotton    555\r\n      rice       65\r\n      tobacco   176\r\n      sugar      63\r\n      wine     2110\r\n               ----\r\n               2969\r\n\r\nThis is little less than three-fourths of the state of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThe authority for cotton, rice, and tobacco, is Seybert's\r\nStatistical Annals, and the personal information of gentlemen of\r\nexperience in the culture of those articles.\r\n\r\nFor sugar I have the authority of Humboldt's _Essai Politique_.\r\n\r\nFor wine I depend on Chaptal: his \"Treatise, theoretical and\r\npractical, on the culture of the vine, and the art of making wine,\r\nbrandy, spirits of wine, and vinegars, simple and compound,\" is a\r\ntruly classic work, in which he had the aid of Rozier, Parmentier,\r\nand Dussieux. It contains all that the chemist, or botanist, or vine\r\ncultivator, or enlightened statesman can reasonably ask or wish to\r\nknow. It is in two octavo volumes, of about 500 pages each, with 21\r\nplates.\r\n\r\nThis admirable treatise should be translated for the use of our\r\nfellow citizens who occupy our wine-yielding regions. For, in a\r\nfew years, the United States will produce wine for their domestic\r\nconsumption and exportation.\r\n\r\nA revolution of our planet on its axis would present to the eye of\r\nan observer, at the distance of a few thousand miles, a few spots or\r\nspecks (China or Holland) fully cultivated. The rest would be as a\r\ndesert. Pauperism in England, now so extensive and so dangerous, is\r\nfulfilling the prophecies of Goldsmith's Deserted Village.\r\n\r\n\"Political economy (says Jean Baptiste Say,) is founded on\r\nstatistical knowledge, or (what is the same thing) history;\" and\r\nthat \"the American confederacy will have the glory of proving that\r\nthe loftiest policy is in accordance with moderation and humanity.\"\r\n\r\nThe most active mind has not yet conceived an adequate idea of the\r\nvast resources of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Washington City_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND REMARKS--BY THE EDITOR OF THE REGISTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _general_ average value of the products of the United States\r\nexported, may be estimated as amounting to 45,000,000 dollars, at\r\nfair prices; the cotton, tobacco, and rice, included in which, may\r\nbe valued at 21,000,000--the balance is made up of bread stuffs and\r\nmeats, the product of the forest and of the sea, and 2,000,000 in\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nThe chief things that we have for _export_ bear about the following\r\nproportions to their respective quantities _consumed_ in the United\r\nStates--assuming 45 millions as the amount of value exported, and\r\ntaking our products at their average quantities.\r\n\r\n                               _Val. or am't   Val. or am't\r\n                                     exported.       consumed_.\r\n\r\n  Bread stuffs, meats & drinks,  D. 13,500,000  270,000,000\r\n  Provender for horses, &c.

This amount includes ALL sorts of\r\ndisbursements needful to the subsistence, convenience and comfort\r\nof the people, except the product of the value of labour directly\r\napplied to the _erection_ of buildings or other permanent works. The\r\namount, though it appears enormous, I am satisfied is less than the\r\nactual value consumed. It brings out the general result, that our\r\nexports stand to our consumption as 45 is to 620--or as _one_ is to\r\n_fourteen_, at the present time. When the price of commodities was\r\nhigher, the rate was as _one_ to _seventeen_.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of each of the preceding items are about as follows:\r\n\r\n                            _Exported. Consumed._\r\n\r\n  Bread stuffs, meats & drinks, as 1 is to 21\r\n  Provender,                       1  --  200\r\n  Manufactured articles,           1  --  110\r\n  Product of the fisheries,        1  --    6\r\n  ---- forest,                     1  --   10\r\n  Cotton,                          2  --    1 (nearly.)\r\n  Tobacco,                         3  --    1\r\n  Rice,                            1  --    1\r\n\r\nIt would be excessively tedious to attempt to detail the multitude\r\nof items that affect these general conclusions. Accuracy is not\r\npretended in either of them. Probabilities only are aimed at.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts assumed as being pretty near the truth, we may\r\nestimate the importance of the home trade, or internal commerce and\r\nconsumption of the people, and arrive at a multitude of highly\r\ninteresting considerations. Take the following for an example:\r\n\r\nThe sudden introduction of less than 500,000 persons, would leave us\r\nno surplus of _present_ products of food for men. But it is a demand\r\nfor this surplus, no matter how created, that assesses the value of\r\nthe whole product. Such products, let the fact be recollected, were\r\nat as high prices during the late war, when there was very little\r\nexport of them, as they are now, the difference in the value of\r\nour circulating medium being also considered. This was caused by a\r\npartial want of agricultural labourers; but more by the waste of\r\nprovisions that belong to a belligerent state.\r\n\r\nForeign commerce, nevertheless, has a powerful bearing on the\r\nconsideration of value in a state of peace, to the growers of grain,\r\nmeats, &c. The amount beyond their own _immediate_ consumption\r\nand that of their families, may be about two fifths of the whole,\r\nbesides the foreign export, or nearly 110 millions,--the _price_\r\nof which is fixed by the small amount of 13,500,000 dollars' worth\r\nsent abroad! And, this little surplus remaining unconsumed, or\r\nwithout being wasted, at home, would depreciate the general value\r\nof the whole surplus at least 50 per cent. Hence, it would seem of\r\ngreater interest to the farmers even to _destroy_ a portion of their\r\nproducts, than to cast them into a glutted market, according to the\r\nprinciples acted upon by the Dutch in regard to spices. A policy not\r\nto be recommended on the score of morality, but as according with\r\nthe spirit of trade. It cannot, therefore, be advantageous to the\r\nagriculturist to depend upon a foreign market to assess the value of\r\nhis articles, for it is, and ever must be uncertain and unsteady. It\r\nis his interest to have a market at home, for this may be depended\r\nupon, and the product will be regulated by the demand, so as to\r\nleave a fair profit.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of observation, on a certain occasion, when I Was\r\nspeaking on this subject, related the following case in point.\r\n\r\nAt an interval of about 10 years, he had stopped for a short time\r\nat a certain village in Connecticut--when first there, it contained\r\ntwo first rate taverns, and one other respectable establishment of\r\nthe same kind. Two lines of stages made it their halting place every\r\nnight, and all seemed flourishing and lively. When there again, the\r\nthree taverns were shut up, or at least not occupied as such, and he\r\nhad to apply at a private house to be accommodated during his stay,\r\nand every thing appeared dull and desolate. He asked the reason.--It\r\nwas the establishment of steam-boats which had destroyed the lines\r\nof stages, and driven off the persons and horses that they had given\r\nemployment to, and of course the market they created, which hitherto\r\ntook off all the surplus products of the neighbourhood, had ceased\r\nto be. A thousand instances of this sort might be noted to prove\r\nthat a _ready market_ is the prosperity of a neighbourhood, country,\r\nstate, or nation.\r\n\r\nOn the different items, especially those of _cotton_ and _sugar_,\r\nas mentioned by the writer in the National Intelligencer, we intend\r\nto speak particularly hereafter, in the essays we have promised to\r\nwrite under the head of \"Political Economics,\" the introduction to\r\nwhich appeared in the Register of the 13th ult. page 162.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vine Dressing near Vevay._\r\n\r\n\r\n  VEVAY, (Indiana) Oct. 28.\r\n\r\nThe season for making wine is just over; and notwithstanding the\r\nuncommon dry season, the vine dressers near Vevay have made four\r\nthousand eight hundred and ninety-two gallons.\r\n\r\n[We copy the following from Niles' Weekly Register, with an\r\nintention, as his proposed essays appear, of giving them a place in\r\nthe _Rural Magazine_,--having no doubt, from our knowledge of the\r\neditor, but they will be instructive as well as Interesting to our\r\nreaders.--_Ed._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Political Economics._\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nThough so much has been said on political economy as applicable to\r\nthe national prosperity, by profits derived from national industry,\r\nthat we despair of offering any new thing on the subject, we have\r\nso far yielded to the wishes of many friends as to resolve upon the\r\npublication of a new series of essays, to elucidate some of the\r\nfacts that belong to this deeply interesting concern--a concern\r\nthat presses itself into every man's business, which invades our\r\nfire-sides and accompanies us to our bed-chambers: yet, so beset\r\nwith it, and feeling it in all that we have to sell or want to buy,\r\nand in whatsoever business we do that requires the aid of money or\r\nuse of credit--still we shrink from the trouble of ascertaining\r\nits operation and extent. The mind, by repeated mortifications and\r\ndisappointments, loses its tone; and we seem rather disposed to\r\ntrust to the chapter of accidents for redress, than rouse ourselves\r\nto an exertion to put an end to our wrongs, through the means\r\nafforded; forgetting that effects flow from causes.\r\n\r\nIt has pleased Providence to bless us with a \"goodly land,\" and we\r\nare favoured with the best system of government ever devised--but\r\nthe seat of ancient Paradise is a howling waste, and Greece and Rome\r\nare tenanted by slaves.\r\n\r\nA nation's prosperity is the happiness of the individuals composing\r\nit. The freeman cannot be a happy man unless private industry\r\nsecures private independence; and freedom itself must pass into\r\ndespotism. The power of a government rests in the moral and physical\r\nforce of the governed, and its wealth is constituted by personal\r\nacquisitions of property. Governments were made for the good of\r\nthe people, not the people for governments; and their object fails\r\nwhen private happiness ceases to be respected. Emancipation from\r\npolitical tyranny, without the means of preserving personal liberty,\r\nis a nullity. The gift of life without the means of living, is\r\ndestitute of value.\r\n\r\nProduction is the only source of national wealth that can be\r\ndepended upon. The home market, even to the most commercial nations,\r\nis of many times the amount of the foreign one. The former is not\r\neasily effected, except by a self-mistaken policy; but the latter\r\nis as capricious as the winds, and beyond our control. Speculation\r\ndoes not create value--the purchase and sale of a million's worth\r\nof goods does not improve their quality or add to their quantity,\r\nto the amount of a cent. A change of commodities between different\r\ncountries, may increase their value to the extent of the labour\r\nexpended in transporting them; and it is generally convenient,\r\nif not advantageous, when exchanges are made on equal terms. But\r\npoverty must be the lot of every society which barters the labour of\r\ntwo or more of its members for that of one person in another society.\r\n\r\nEmployment is the best preservative of health and morals. Things\r\nshould be so that every person willing to labour for his living,\r\nshould find labour to do, and live plentifully. If it is otherwise,\r\nan error has been committed that ought to be corrected immediately,\r\nfor it is pregnant with the greatest evils. It is the chief check\r\nto population, and more powerful than the sword to destroy the\r\nliberties of nations. Nations and individuals are spendthrifts of\r\nthe worst description when they purchase that which they can make\r\nfrom the spare labour at home. Who will give away a hundred dollars\r\nand their interest for ever, for the sake of receiving twenty\r\ndollars of his own money as a premium? Yet thus a nation acts when,\r\nfor the sake of the duties on imports, it accepts of another nation\r\nany commodity which it might supply itself with, without detriment\r\nto its other branches of industry.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is the noblest and best occupation of man; and in a\r\ncountry like the United States, where land is plenty and labour\r\nscarce, it will always be pushed to the extent which a profitable\r\nmarket demands. Yet if none worked but those who laboured in the\r\nfield, society could not exist long. We should perish with cold and\r\nhunger. It is by an association of the arts that we live--and our\r\ncomfort materially depends on their respective perfections. Only\r\nabout one fifth of a population are fitted for agricultural labours,\r\nin general. The other four fifths, if idle would consume the whole\r\namount of value produced, and send the labourers supperless to bed.\r\nIt is the capacity of production in the most numerous body that must\r\nbe brought into action, if families and nations would prosper and\r\nbe happy. If they purchase any thing which their lost time might be\r\napplied to the fabrication of--they might as well throw its cost\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our essays, which we expect to commence in two\r\nor three weeks, we shall endeavour to point out some of the chief\r\nthings that require the protection of government, just as those of\r\na well regulated family are managed; and shew that the well being\r\nof a nation depends upon a fair exchange of labour for labour,\r\nsubstantials for substantials, and even luxuries for luxuries. The\r\nman who exchanges wheat for _ear-rings_, unless those rings are\r\nmanufactured in his country, wastes to the country the whole amount\r\nof the _intrinsic_ value of the wheat over that of the _ear-rings_,\r\nwhich latter is only that of the metal composing them. A nation\r\ncannot be independent, if it looks to another for necessaries--it\r\ncannot be rich, if it exchanges necessaries for luxuries. And\r\nluxuries, especially, should not be received at all, unless things\r\nof the same class are remitted in payment for them. The effect\r\nof these on population and manners, will also be considered, and\r\nillustrated by many statistical facts--as leisure is allowed to\r\narrange them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM HUMBOLDT'S PERSONAL NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Coffee Plant._\r\n\r\nThe coffee tree flowers only the second year, and the flowering\r\nlasts only twenty-four hours. At this time the shrub has a charming\r\naspect; seen from afar, it seems covered with snow. The produce\r\nof the third year becomes very abundant. In plantations well\r\nweeded and watered, and recently cultivated, we find trees bearing\r\nsixteen, eighteen, and even twenty pounds of coffee. In general,\r\nhowever, a produce of more than a pound and a half or two pounds\r\ncannot be expected from each plant; and even this is superior to\r\nthe mean produce of the West India Islands. Rains at the time of\r\nthe flowering, the want of water for artificial irrigations, and\r\na patastic plant, a new species of coranthus, which clings to the\r\nbranches, are extremely injurious to the coffee trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sugar Cane._\r\n\r\nThree species of sugar cane can be distinguished even at a distance,\r\nby the colour of their leaves; the ancient Creole sugar cane,\r\nthe Otaheite cane, and the Batavia cane. The first has a leaf\r\nof a deeper green, the stem less thick, and the knots nearer\r\ntogether.--This sugar cane was the first introduced from India into\r\nSicily, the Canary Islands and the West Indies. The second is of a\r\nlighter green; and its stem is higher, thicker, and more succulent.\r\nThe whole plant displays a more luxuriant vegetation. We owe this\r\nplant to the voyages of Bougainville, Cook, and Bligh. Bougainville\r\ncarried it to the Isle of France, whence it passed to Cayenne,\r\nMartinique, and since 1792, to the rest of the West India Islands.\r\nThe sugar cane of Otaheite, the _To_ of those islanders, is one of\r\nthe most important acquisitions, for which colonial agriculture is\r\nindebted to the travels of naturalists. It yields not only one third\r\nmore of juice than the Creolian cane on the same space of land; but\r\nfrom the thickness of its stem, and the tenacity of its ligneous\r\nfibres, it furnishes much more fuel. The last advantage is important\r\nto the West Indies, where the destruction of the forests has for a\r\nlong time obliged the planters to use the canes deprived of their\r\njuice, to keep up the fire under their boilers.\r\n\r\nBut from the knowledge of this new plant, the progress of\r\nagriculture on the continent of Spanish America, and the\r\nintroduction of the East India and Java sugars, the revolutions of\r\nSt. Domingo, and the destruction of the great sugar plantations of\r\nthat island, would have had a more sensible effect on the prices\r\nof colonial produce in Europe. The Otaheite sugar cane was carried\r\nfrom the Isle of Trinidad to Caraccas. From Caraccas it passed\r\nto Cicuta and San Gil in the kingdom of New Grenada. In our days\r\nits cultivation during twenty-five years almost entirely removed\r\nthe apprehension, which was at first entirely entertained, that,\r\ntransplanted to America, the plant would by degrees degenerate,\r\nand become as slender as the Creole cane. If it be a variety, it\r\nis a very constant one. The third species, the violet sugar cane,\r\ncalled _Cana de Batavia_, or _de Guinea_, is entirely indigenous\r\nin the island of Java, where it is cultivated in preference in the\r\ndistricts of Jupara and Pasuruan. Its foliage is purple, and very\r\nbroad; and it is preferred in the province of Caraccas for rum. The\r\n_tablones_, or grounds planted with sugar canes, are divided by\r\nhedges of a collossal gramen; the latta, or gynesium with distich\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_American Fig Tree_.\r\n\r\nThe trunks of these trees are covered with very odoriferous\r\nplants of vanilla, which, in general, flower only in the month of\r\nApril.--We were here again struck with those ligneous excrescenses,\r\nwhich in the form of ridges, or ribs, augment, in so extraordinary\r\na manner, and as far as twenty feet above the ground, the thickness\r\nof the trunk of the fig trees of America. I found trees twenty-two\r\nfeet and a half in diameter near the roots.--These ligneous ridges\r\nsometimes separate from the trunk at a height of eight feet, and are\r\ntransformed into cylindrical roots two feet thick. The tree looks\r\nas if it were supported by buttresses. This scaffolding, however,\r\ndoes not penetrate very deep into the earth. The lateral roots wind\r\nat the surface of the ground, and when at twenty feet distance from\r\nthe trunk, they are cut with the hatchet, we see the milky juice of\r\nthe fig tree gush out, which, when deprived of the vital influence\r\nof the organs of the tree, is altered and coagulates. What a\r\nwonderful combination of cells and vessels exist in these vegetable\r\nmasses; in these gigantic trees of the torrid zone, which, without\r\ninterruption, perhaps during a thousand years, prepare nutritious\r\nfluids, raise them to the height of 180 feet, convey them down again\r\nto the ground, and conceal beneath a rough and hard bark, under the\r\ninanimate layers of ligneous matter, all the movements of organic\r\nlife!\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cow Tree._\r\n\r\n\"Amid the great number of curious phenomena which have presented\r\nthemselves to me in the course of my travels, I confess there are\r\nfew that have so powerfully affected my imagination, as the aspect\r\nof the cow tree.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever relates to milk, whatever regards corn, inspires an\r\ninterest, which is not merely that of the physical knowledge of\r\nthings, but is connected with another order of ideas and sentiments.\r\nWe can scarcely conceive how the human race could exist without\r\nfarinaceous substances, and without that nourishing juice which\r\nthe breast of the mother contains, and which is appropriated to\r\nthe long feebleness of the infant. The amylaceous matter of corn,\r\nthe object of religious veneration among so many nations, ancient\r\nand modern, is diffused in the seeds and deposited in the roots\r\nof vegetables; milk, which serves us as an aliment, appears to\r\nus exclusively the produce of animal organization.--Such are the\r\nimpressions we have received in our earliest infancy; such is also\r\nthe source of that astonishment which seizes us at the aspect of the\r\ntree just described. It has not here the solemn shades of forests,\r\nthe majestic course of rivers, the mountains wrapped in eternal\r\nfrosts, that excite our emotion.--A few drops of vegetable juice\r\nrecal to our minds all the powerfulness and fecundity of nature.\r\nOn the barren flank of rock grows a tree with coriaceous and dry\r\nleaves. Its large woody roots can scarcely penetrate into the stone.\r\nFor several months of the year not a single shower moistens its\r\nfoliage. Its branches appear dead and dried; but when its trunk is\r\npierced, there flows from it a sweet and nourishing milk. It is at\r\nthe rising of the sun that this vegetable fountain is most abundant.\r\nThe blacks and natives are then seen hastening from all quarters,\r\nfurnished with large bowls to receive the milk, which grows yellow,\r\nand thickens at its surface. Some employ their bowls under the tree\r\nitself, others carry the juice home to their children. We seem to\r\nsee the family of a shepherd, who distributes the milk to his flock.\r\n\r\n\"I have described the sensation which the cow tree awakens in the\r\nmind of the traveller, at the first view. In examining the physical\r\nproperties of animal and vegetable products, science displays\r\nthem as closely linked together; but it strips them of what is\r\nmarvellous, and perhaps also a part of their charms, of what\r\nexcited our astonishment.--Nothing appears insolated; the chemical\r\nprinciples that were believed to be peculiar to animals are found in\r\nplants; a common chain links together all organic nature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Singular effect of Peruvian Bark._\r\n\r\n\r\nA French merchant, at Guayra, named Delpech, in 1806, had occasion\r\nto receive several travellers, inhabitants of those countries. The\r\napartments destined for visitors being filled, and the number of his\r\nguests increasing, he was under the necessity of putting several of\r\nthem in rooms occupied by _cinchona_. Each of them contained from\r\n8 to 10 thousand pounds of that bark. One of his guests was ill of\r\na very malignant fever. After the first day he found himself much\r\nbetter, though he had taken no medicine; but he was surrounded with\r\nan atmosphere of cinchona which appeared very agreeable to him.\r\nIn a few days he felt himself quite recovered without any medical\r\ntreatment whatever. This unexpected success led M. Delpech to make\r\nsome other trials. Several persons, ill of fever, were placed\r\nsuccessively in his magazine of cinchona, and they were all speedily\r\ncured, simply by the effluvia of the bark.\r\n\r\nIn the same place with the cinchona, he kept a bale of coffee, and\r\nsome bottles of common French brandy. In some time M. Delpech, when\r\nvisiting his magazine, observed one of the large bottles uncorked.\r\nHe suspected at first the fidelity of a servant, and determined to\r\nexamine the quality of the brandy. What was his astonishment to find\r\nit infinitely superior to what it had been!--A slightly aromatic\r\ntaste added to its strength, and rendered it more tonic and more\r\nagreeable. Curious to know if the coffee had likewise changed its\r\nproperties, he opened the bale, and roasted a portion of it. It was\r\nmore bitter and left in the mouth a taste similar to that of the\r\neffluvia of bark.--The bark which produced these singular effects\r\nwas fresh. Would the cinchona of commerce have the same efficacy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oil of Pumpkin Seed._\r\n\r\nC. S. KAPINESQUE, Esq. to Doct. SAMUEL MITCHELL.\r\n\r\n_New York, 20th Feb. 1819._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Harmony, on the banks of the Wabash, in the state of\r\nIndiana, last summer, I was told by the industrious German Society\r\nof the Harmonites, that instead of throwing away or giving to the\r\npigs the seeds of their pumpkins, as is usually done all over the\r\ncountry, they collected them and made an oil from them which they\r\nuse for all the purposes of lamp oil and olive oil. It is well\r\nknown, that all the different species and varieties of pumpkins\r\n(genus _cuburbita_ Linnæus) afford an oil which has valuable medical\r\nproperties, possessing in the highest degree the refrigerative\r\nquality; but I had never heard before of its being made on a large\r\nscale, and for economical uses.\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficient to mention this fact to some of our\r\nenlightened farmers, to induce them to imitate the worthy\r\nHarmonites, and I recommend highly the practice, as likely to become\r\neminently beneficial. The pumpkin seeds afford their oil with the\r\ngreatest facility and abundance. One gallon of seeds will give\r\nabout half a gallon of oil. They may be pressed like rape and flax\r\nseed.--Their oil is clear, limpid pale, scentless, and when used for\r\nsalad instead of sweet oil, has merely a faint insipid taste; it\r\nburns well, and without smoke. Those advantages entitle it to our\r\nattention, as an indigenous production of first necessity. Pumpkins\r\ngrow all over the United States, from Maine to Louisiana, and with\r\nsuch luxuriance, as to produce sometimes as much as 50,000_lbs._\r\nweight of fruits, and about 2000 _lbs._ weight of seeds, in one acre\r\nof Indian corn without injuring the crop of corn. Those 2000 _lbs._\r\nof seeds might produce about 200 gallons of oil, worth about 200\r\ndollars. I calculate that about two millions of gallons of such oil\r\ncould be made annually in the United States, from the seeds that are\r\nwasted or given to cattle and pigs. This is worth saving--and in\r\naddition to the bread, pies, soups, dishes, feed, &c. afforded by\r\npumpkins, we shall have a good and wholesome home-made vegetable oil\r\nfor lamps and food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Disease among Horses._\r\n\r\nMIFFLINTOWN, (Penn.) Nov. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nA disease prevails among the horses in this part of the country, by\r\nsome called the Burnt Tongue. We understand that it originated in\r\nthe western section of this state, and has extended along this route\r\nfrom Pittsburg to Philadelphia. It has in a few instances proved\r\nfatal: but we understand that the stages west of the Alleghany have\r\nbeen stopped, and numbers of wagonners are obliged to lie by in\r\nconsequence of it. It affects the tongue and prevents the creature\r\nfrom eating, and is very catching, so much so, that it is said a\r\nbeast will take it in consequence of its having been _hitched_ at\r\nthe same place that the one has stood which was affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANCASTER, (Penn.) Nov. 23.\r\n\r\nThe following method of practice and recipe for the care of the\r\nprevailing disease among horses, called _sore mouth_, was obtained\r\nfrom Mr. Tomlinson, (one of the proprietors of the Western Mail\r\nStages) on his return from visiting the sick horses in the line, and\r\nI am authorized to say, will, if strictly attended to, succeed in\r\ncuring in 99 _cases in_ 100--by inserting it you will oblige MANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPE.\r\n\r\nOn the commencement of the disease, bleed moderately. If the blood,\r\nafter cooling, appears to have much buff on it, repeat the bleeding;\r\ngive a pint of castor oil; if it does not operate in 16 hours, give\r\ntwo thirds of a pint. Nitre may be given at the rate of 2 _oz_. a\r\nday, or salts two or three times a week; 1/4 _lb._ at a time. These\r\nmay be given in a thin mash, or rather slop of bran, it being the\r\nbest food for the animal while diseased.\r\n\r\nTake half a pint of honey, one table spoonful of borax, and one\r\nquart of strong sage tea. Mix them well together; then take a stick\r\nand tie a soft rag to the end of it, dip it in the mixture, and wash\r\nthe tongue, gums and mouth well; the more frequent the better, at\r\nleast every two hours. Sweet milk in the tea will do no harm, or\r\na little nitre may occasionally be put in it with good effect. Be\r\nparticular in keeping the mouth clean and nursing the horse with\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nThe pulse and appearance of the blood must govern as to the\r\nnecessity of bleeding more than once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Arabian Horse_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis noble animal, which lately arrived in the ship Horatio, has\r\nbeen sold for _four thousand dollars_, to Messrs. Allison and Van\r\nRanst, and has been conveyed to Long Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wild Horse of the West._\r\n\r\nThe horse of the Columbia River will rank with the finest of his\r\nspecies in the known world. His size is fifteen or sixteen hands,\r\neven in a state of nature, unprovided with food or shelter by the\r\nhands of man. His form exhibits much bone and muscle, but not\r\nthe mass of flesh which is found on the fat European horse.--His\r\nlimbs are clean and slender; the neck arched and rising; the hoofs\r\nround and hard; and the nostrils wide and thin. He is equally\r\ndistinguished for speed and bottom. He runs rapidly, and for a\r\nlong time; rivalling, in this respect, all that we have heard of\r\nthe English hunting horses. In other respects--in the docility of\r\nhis nature, in his capacity to sustain hunger and hardship, in his\r\npowers to provide food for himself and his master, he is wholly\r\nunrivalled. He is readily trained to the business of his master's\r\nlife, that of hunting, and pursues the game with all the keenness of\r\nthe dog, and with equal sagacity and more success. He will run down\r\nthe deer in the _prairies_, with or without his master on his back,\r\nand, when overtaken, will hold it with his teeth. When rode after\r\ngame he needs no guiding of the bridle to direct him. He will pursue\r\na drove of buffaloes, and, coming up with them, will stop one by\r\nbiting him with his teeth. The animal bitten, immediately wheels to\r\ndefend himself with his horns; the horse wheels at the same instant\r\nto avoid it; and at this moment, when the side of the buffalo is\r\npresented, the Indian lets fly an arrow, which often passes entirely\r\nthrough his body. The wounded animal always turns out of the drove\r\nto lay down and die. The horse and his rider pursue the gang to make\r\nfresh slaughter. Another horse trained to a second part of the game,\r\nwith other Indians, take the trail of the wounded buffalo, which is\r\nbutchered and carried into camp. These things seem incredibel; but\r\nwe have them upon the authority of Lewis and Clarke, and a great\r\nnumber of traders who have been upon the Columbia river since the\r\ntime of their discovery; some of whom are now in this town.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of this horse to sustain fatigue, and to provide\r\nfood for himself, is equally astonishing. He is galloped all day,\r\nsometimes 80 or 90 miles in the space of 10 or 12 hours, and is then\r\nleft to shift for himself during the night. In the spring, summer\r\nand autumn, he finds no difficulty; the short and sweet grass of\r\nthat country gives him an abundant and nutricious repast. In the\r\nwinter, and towards the mountains, where the snow is several feet\r\ndeep, his unerring instinct tells him where to search; he scrapes\r\naway the snow with his hoof till he comes to the ground, and rooting\r\nthere with his nose, finds wherewith of moss and grass to sustain\r\nhis life. On the borders of creeks and rivers he feeds on the boughs\r\nof willows, and other soft wood, which his master has sometimes the\r\nkindness to fell for him with a hatchet.\r\n\r\nThis fine animal is found on the banks of the Columbia, in latitude\r\n46, in the great plain which lies on the borders of this river,\r\nbetween the upper and lower range of mountains. His origin is traced\r\nto Mexico, thence to Spain, thence to the North of Africa, where the\r\nArabian barb is found in all the perfection of his species. His fine\r\nform, his generous spirit, and his noble qualities, are preserved\r\nupon the Columbia river; and certainly it is worthy the experiment\r\nto endeavour to transplant him into other parts of the United\r\nStates. Many citizens have attempted to do so; but have always been\r\nrobbed by the Indians of the Rocky Mountains. Lewis and Clarke\r\nprocured 73, said by Gov. Clark to be the most beautiful collection\r\nof horses that he has ever seen together before or since; but the\r\nwhole number was stolen from them by Indians, who followed their\r\ntrail, and never ceased their operations until they had carried off\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n  [_St. Louis Inquirer._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES WATT.\r\n\r\n(Ascribed to an eminent writer.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath is still busy in our high places; and it is with great pain\r\nthat we find ourselves called upon, so soon after the loss of Mr.\r\nPlayfair, to record the decease of another of our illustrious\r\ncountrymen, and one to whom mankind has been still more largely\r\nindebted. Mr. James Watt, the great improver of the steam-engine,\r\ndied on the 25th ult. at his seat of Heathfield, near Birmingham, in\r\nthe 84th year of his age.\r\n\r\nThis name, fortunately, needs no commemoration of ours; for he that\r\nbore it survived to see it crowned with undisputable and unenvied\r\nhonours; and many generations will probably pass away before it\r\nshall have \"gathered all its fame.\" We have said that Mr. Watt was\r\nthe great _improver_ of the steam-engine; but, in truth, as to\r\nall that is admirable in its structure, or vast in its utility,\r\nhe should rather be described as its _inventor_. It was by his\r\ninventions that its action was so regulated as to make it capable of\r\nbeing applied to the finest and most delicate manufactures, and its\r\npower so increased as to set weight and solidity at defiance. By his\r\nadmirable contrivances, it has become a thing stupendous alike for\r\nits force and its flexibility; for the prodigious power which it can\r\nexert, and the ease and precision, and ductility, with which they\r\ncan be varied, distributed, and applied. The trunk of an elephant\r\nthat can pick up a pin or rend an oak is nothing to it. It can\r\nengrave a seal, and crush masses of obdurate metal like wax before\r\nit, draw out, without breaking, a thread as fine as a gossamer, and\r\nlift up a ship of war like a bauble in the air. It can embroider\r\nmuslin and forge anchors, cut steel into ribbands, and impel loaded\r\nvessels against the fury of the winds and waves.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to estimate the value of the benefits which\r\nthese inventions have conferred upon the country. There is no\r\nbranch of industry that has not been indebted to them; and in all\r\nthe most material, they have not only widened most magnificently\r\nthe field of its exertions, but multiplied a thousand fold the\r\namount of its productions. It is our improved steam-engine which\r\nnow enables us to pay the interest of our debt, and to maintain\r\nthe arduous struggle in which we are still engaged, with the skill\r\nand capital of countries less oppressed with taxation. But these\r\nare poor and narrow views of its importance. It has increased\r\nindefinitely the mass of human comforts and enjoyments, and rendered\r\ncheap and accessible all over the world the materials of wealth and\r\nprosperity. It has armed the feeble hand of man, in short, with a\r\npower to which no limits can be assigned, completed the dominion of\r\nmind over the most refractory qualities of matter, and laid a sure\r\nfoundation for all those future miracles of mechanic power, which\r\nare to aid and reward the labours of after generations. It is to the\r\ngenius of one man too that all this is mainly owing; and certainly\r\nno man ever before bestowed such a gift on his kind. The blessing\r\nis not only universal, but unbounded; and the fabled inventors of\r\nthe plough and the loom, who were deified by the erring gratitude\r\nof their rude contemporaries, conferred less important benefits on\r\nmankind than the inventor of our present steam-engine.\r\n\r\nThis will be the fame of Watt with future generations; and it is\r\nsufficient for his race and his country. But to those to whom he\r\nmore immediately belonged, who lived in his society and enjoyed his\r\nconversation, it is not, perhaps, the character in which he will\r\nbe most frequently recalled--most deeply lamented--or even most\r\nhighly admired. Independently of his great attainments in mechanics,\r\nMr. Watt was an extraordinary, and in many respects, a wonderful\r\nman. Perhaps no individual in his age possessed so much and such\r\nvaried and exact information--had read so much, or remembered what\r\nhe had read so accurately and so well. He had infinite quickness\r\nof apprehension, a prodigious memory, and a certain rectifying\r\nand methodising power of understanding, which extracted something\r\nprecious out of all that was presented to it. His stores of\r\nmiscellaneous knowledge were immense--and yet less astonishing than\r\nthe command he had at all times over them. It seemed as if every\r\nsubject that was casually started in conversation with him, had been\r\nthat which he had been last occupied in studying and exhausting;\r\nsuch was the copiousness, the precision, and the admirable clearness\r\nof the information which he poured out upon it without effort or\r\nhesitation. Nor was this promptitude and compass of knowledge\r\nconfined in any degree to the studies connected with his ordinary\r\npursuits. That he should have been minutely and extensively skilled\r\nin chemistry and the arts, and in most of the branches of physical\r\nscience, might perhaps have been conjectured; but it could not\r\nhave been inferred from his usual occupations, and probably is not\r\ngenerally known, that he was curiously learned in many branches of\r\nantiquity, metaphysics, medicine, and etymology, and perfectly at\r\nhome in all the details of architecture, music, and law. He was well\r\nacquainted too with most of the modern languages, and familiar with\r\ntheir most recent literature. Nor was it at all extraordinary to\r\nhear the great mechanician and engineer detailing and expounding,\r\nfor hours together, the metaphysical theories of the German\r\nlogicians, or criticising the measures or the matter of the German\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nHis astonishing memory was aided, no doubt, in a great measure,\r\nby a still higher and rarer faculty--by his power of digesting and\r\narranging in its proper place all the information he received, and\r\nof casting aside and rejecting, as it were instinctively, whatever\r\nwas worthless or immaterial. Every conception that was suggested to\r\nhis mind seemed instantly to take its place among its other rich\r\nfurniture, and to be condensed into the smallest and most convenient\r\nform. He never appeared, therefore, to be at all incumbered or\r\nperplexed with the verbiage of the dull books he perused, or the\r\nidle talk to which he listened; but to have at once extracted, by\r\na kind of intellectual alchemy, all that was worthy of attention,\r\nand to have reduced it to his own use, to its true value and to its\r\nsimplest form. And thus it often happened, that a great deal more\r\nwas learned from his brief and vigorous account of the theories and\r\narguments of tedious writers, than an ordinary student could ever\r\nhave derived from the most faithful study of the originals; and that\r\nerrors and absurdities became manifest from the mere clearness and\r\nplainness of his statement of them, which might have deluded and\r\nperplexed most of his hearers without that invaluable assistance.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say, that with those vast resources, his\r\nconversation was at all times rich and instructive in no ordinary\r\ndegree; but it was, if possible, still more pleasing than wise,\r\nand had all the charms of familiarity, with all the substantial\r\ntreasures of knowledge. No man could be more social in his spirit,\r\nless assuming or fastidious in his manners, or more kind and\r\nindulgent towards all who approached him. He rather liked to talk,\r\nat least in his latter years; but though he took a considerable\r\nshare of the conversation, he rarely suggested the topics on which\r\nit was to turn, but readily and quickly took whatever was presented\r\nby those around him, and astonished the idle and barren propounders\r\nof an ordinary theme, by the treasures which he drew from the mine\r\nwhich they had unconsciously opened. He generally seemed, indeed,\r\nto have no choice or predilection for one subject of discourse\r\nrather than another, but allowed his mind, like a great cyclopædia,\r\nto be opened at any letter his associates might choose to turn\r\nup, and only endeavoured to select from his inexhaustible stores\r\nwhat might be best adapted to the taste of his present hearers.\r\nAs to their capacity, he gave himself no trouble; and, indeed,\r\nsuch was his singular talent for making all things plain, clear,\r\nand intelligible, that scarcely any one could be aware of such a\r\ndeficiency in his presence. His talk, too, though overflowing with\r\ninformation, had no resemblance to lecturing or solemn discoursing,\r\nbut, on the contrary, was full of colloquial spirit and pleasure.\r\nHe had a certain quiet and grave humour, which ran through most\r\nof his conversation, and a vein of temperate jocularity, which\r\ngave infinite zest and effect to the condensed and inexhaustible\r\ninformation which formed its main staple and characteristic. There\r\nwas a little air of affected testiness, and a tone of pretended\r\nrebuke and contradiction, with which he used to address his younger\r\nfriends, that was always felt by them as an endearing mark of his\r\nkindness and familiarity, and prized accordingly far beyond all the\r\nsolemn compliments that ever proceeded from the lips of authority.\r\nHis voice was deep and powerful, though he commonly spoke in a low\r\nand somewhat monotonous tone, which harmonized admirably with the\r\nweight and brevity of his observations, and set off to the greatest\r\nadvantage the pleasant anecdotes which he delivered with the same\r\ngrave brow and the same calm smile playing soberly on his lips.\r\nThere was nothing of effort indeed, or impatience, any more than of\r\npride or levity, in his demeanour; and there was a finer expression\r\nof reposing strength, and mild self-possession in his manner, than\r\nwe ever recollect to have met with in any other person. He had in\r\nhis character the utmost abhorrence for all sorts of forwardness,\r\nparade and pretensions; and, indeed, never failed to put all such\r\nimpostors out of countenance, by the manly plainness and honest\r\nintrepidity of his language and deportment.\r\n\r\nIn his temper and dispositions he was not only kind and\r\naffectionate, but generous and considerate of the feelings of all\r\naround him, and gave the most liberal assistance and encouragement\r\nto all young persons who showed any indications of talent, or\r\napplied to him for patronage or advice. His health, which was\r\ndelicate from his youth upwards, seemed to become firmer as he\r\nadvanced in years; and he preserved, up almost to the last moment\r\nof his existence, not only the full command of his extraordinary\r\nintellect, but all the alacrity of spirit, and the social gaiety\r\nwhich had illuminated his happiest days. His friends in this part\r\nof the country never saw him more full of intellectual vigour and\r\ncolloquial animation, never more delightful or instructive, than in\r\nhis last visit to Scotland, in autumn, 1817. Indeed, it was after\r\nthat time that he applied himself, with all the ardour of early\r\nlife, to the invention of a machine for mechanically copying all\r\nsorts of sculpture and statuary, and distributed among his friends\r\nsome of its earliest performances, as the productions of a young\r\nartist just entering on his 83d year.\r\n\r\nThis happy and useful life came at last to a gentle close. He\r\nhad suffered some inconveniences through the summer; but was not\r\nseriously indisposed till within a few weeks from his death. He\r\nthen became perfectly aware of the event which was approaching; and\r\nwith his usual tranquillity and benevolence of nature, seemed only\r\nanxious to point out to the friends around him the many sources of\r\nconsolation, which were afforded by the circumstances under which\r\nit was about to take place. He expressed his sincere gratitude to\r\nProvidence for the length of days with which he had been blessed,\r\nand his exemption from most of the infirmities of age, as well\r\nas for the calm and cheerful evening of life that he had been\r\npermitted to enjoy, after the honourable labours of the day had been\r\nconcluded. And thus, full of years and honours, in all calmness and\r\ntranquillity he yielded up his soul, without pang or struggle, and\r\npassed from the bosom of his family to that of his God!\r\n\r\nHe was twice married, but has left no issue but one son, long\r\nassociated with him in his business and studies, and two\r\ngrand-children by a daughter who predeceased him. He was a fellow\r\nof the Royal Societies both of London and Edinburgh, and of the\r\nfew Englishmen who were elected members of the National Institute\r\nof France. All men of learning and science were his cordial\r\nfriends; and such was the influence of his mild character and\r\nperfect fairness and liberality, even upon the pretenders to these\r\naccomplishments, that he lived to disarm even envy itself, and died,\r\nwe verily believe, without a single enemy.

But as the proper\r\nconstruction of a chimney and fire-place is one of the greatest\r\ncomforts of domestic life, I cannot doubt but that government will\r\ngrant me a handsome premium for making public an unerring rule by\r\nwhich they can be so built as never to fail of drawing well, without\r\nemitting any smoke into the apartment. When the principle was first\r\ndiscovered by me, I wondered how it could so happen, that we had\r\nany defective chimnies amongst us; for I remembered to have heard\r\nthat Dr. Franklin and count Rumford had devoted much attention to\r\nthis subject, and must, of course, as I thought, have discovered\r\na principle so plain and self-evident; and consequently, every\r\nmechanic must have learnt it, as not they only were interested in\r\nit, but every one of the civilized world.--After thinking of it in\r\nthis way, I took an opportunity of inquiring into their opinions,\r\nand I find that the principle was never new to either of them;\r\nand as far as I know, I am the first and only discoverer of it.\r\nThe principle consists simply in making the size of the flue bear\r\na certain proportion to the size of the fire-place in front. To\r\nascertain what would be the smallest proportion which the flue would\r\nbear to the front of the fire-place, would require some experiments.\r\nBut it is probable that a fire-place 2-1/2 feet square in front,\r\nwould draw well enough to carry up all the smoke, by a flue 12 by 14\r\ninches, and probably by a one foot square: or even less may probably\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nIf one foot square, would carry all the smoke of such a fire-place,\r\nthe proportion would be 144 to 900, or a little more than 1/7, and\r\na little less than 1/6. But for greater certainty, we will say 1/5\r\nis the proper proportion, and that a flue to a fire-place 2-1/2 feet\r\nsquare, shall be 12 by 15 inches. If the front be twice that size,\r\n(3 feet 6 and near a half square) then the flue or chimney must be\r\n12 by 30 inches, or near 19 inches square. If it be three times\r\nthe first size, or near 4 feet 4 inches square, then the flue must\r\nbe 12 by 45--15 by 36, or nearly 23-1/4 inches square. Or if it be\r\nfour times the size of the first, or 5 feet square, the flue must\r\nbe equal to nearly 27 inches square, and so accordingly, whatever\r\nmay be the dimensions of the fire-place in front. I do not know\r\nthat a lesser proportion would not do: and whatever experience\r\nmay establish, as that best adapted to answer the end proposed,\r\nit will not invalidate the principle laid down, but confirm it.\r\nOne thing, however, is true, that the smaller the fire-place is\r\nin proportion to the flue, the harder it will draw, and by being\r\nthus proportioned, it may have any degree of draught given to it at\r\npleasure, from that of an air furnace to that which will scarcely\r\ndraw up the smoke. Any one may convince himself of the truth of\r\nthis doctrine, by taking a board and closing up the fire-place,\r\ndownwards from the mantle, and in proportion as it diminishes by the\r\nboard moving downwards, the power of its draught will be increased.\r\nFranklin was aware of this fact, but was ignorant of the principle\r\non which it depended, as he supposed the height of the chimney, and\r\nnot its dimensions governed the fact itself,--and hence mentions\r\nthat the higher the chimney, the larger the opening may be: and that\r\n2-1/2 feet square may be risked on a lower floor and 1-1/2 on the\r\nupper, &c. The common ten plate stove furnishes an example of the\r\ntruth of this principle: when the large fire door is open, the stove\r\nwill smoke, because the large door is an over proportion in size to\r\nthe size of the pipe--but shut the large door and leave the small\r\none open, the stove immediately draws like a furnace, because its\r\narea is smaller than the area of a section of the pipe. If it were\r\ntrue that 2-1/2 feet square was the largest size which could be made\r\nto draw well, it would indeed be an unfortunate fact, as we could\r\nnever have a comfortable kitchen fire-place--but if the principle\r\nhere laid down be true, we can, with equal certainty, build a\r\nfire-place ten feet wide and five high, or of greater dimensions if\r\nwe choose.\r\n\r\nThe height of the chimney I believe to be a matter of no importance\r\nto the draught, and that a low one will draw as well as a high\r\none. The worst smoking chimney that I ever saw was about 47 feet\r\nhigh, in my own house: it smoked because it was too small, and was\r\ncured by adding to it the flue of a fire-place directly above it;\r\non account of which I had to lose a fire-place on the 2d floor. In\r\nthis case the size of both chimneys was barely sufficient to vent\r\nthe smoke of the lower one. The height is a subject which I have\r\nnot investigated, but it strikes me that a low chimney is most\r\nfavourable to drawing well: if any one want an explanation on it, I\r\nwill give it again; but it cannot be of much practical importance.\r\nThe fashion of a fire-place is of no importance to the draught: it\r\nmay be made to please the fancy of the builder. I, however, should\r\nprefer one something near count Rumford's plan. The throat of the\r\nchimney may be contracted or not at pleasure; but for beauty and\r\nadvantage of heat, I should prefer having the back drawn forward and\r\nthe throat narrowed, more especially in a low fire-place. There may\r\nbe local contingent circumstances connected with chimneys, which\r\ncause them to smoke, and must have appropriate remedies: but such do\r\nnot effect the general principles here laid down.\r\n\r\nSmoke, from fires, is naturally carried upward by the heated air,\r\nwhich is specifically lighter than the surrounding atmosphere, and\r\nconsequently ascends, carrying the smoke with it, and if it meet\r\nwith no resistance, will pass up the chimney; but if that be too\r\nsmall to vent it, it regurgitates, as it were, into the apartment;\r\nwhich can only be remedied on the principle heretofore laid down.\r\n\r\nIt might be asked, why will not a small chimney vent all the smoke\r\nof a small fire, in a large fire-place? Two reasons may be assigned:\r\nFirst, the heat of such fire cannot produce a brisk enough current\r\nof rarified air to carry the smoke, and that which is heated, not\r\nhaving free vent, it whirls in eddies into the apartment. Secondly,\r\nsmoke, in itself, is specifically heavier than atmospheric air;\r\nconsisting of aqueous vapour, carbonic acid, and oxid of carbon,\r\nand coming in contact with air not much heated, and parting with a\r\nportion of its own heat, it has then no disposition, in itself, to\r\nascend. But this would lead to a discussion foreign to my present\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n  Yours, &c.
