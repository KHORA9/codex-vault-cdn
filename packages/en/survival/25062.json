At the close of his _Les Tremblements de Terre_, Professor\r\nFouqué has devoted a few chapters to some of the principal earthquakes\r\nbetween 1854 and 1887; and there are also the well-known chapters in\r\nLyell's _Principles of Geology_ dealing with earthquakes of a still\r\nearlier date. With these exceptions, there is no other work covering\r\nthe same ground; and he who wishes to study any particular earthquake\r\ncan only do so by reading long reports or series of papers written\r\nperhaps in several different languages. The object of this volume is\r\nto save him this trouble, and to present to him the facts that seem\r\nmost worthy of his attention.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the Japanese earthquake is reprinted, with a few slight\r\nadditions, from a paper published in the _Geographical Journal_, and I\r\nam indebted to the editor, not only for the necessary permission, but\r\nalso for his courtesy in furnishing me with _clichés_ of the blocks\r\nwhich illustrated the original paper. The editor of _Knowledge_ has\r\nalso allowed me to use a paper which appeared four years ago as the\r\nfoundation of the ninth chapter in this book.\r\n\r\n                                            CHARLES DAVISON.\r\n\r\n  BIRMINGHAM,\r\n      _January, 1905._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.

In\r\njudging of importance, the standard which I have adopted is not that\r\nof intensity only, but rather of the scientific value of the results\r\nthat have been achieved by the study of the shocks. Even with this\r\nreservation, the number of earthquakes that might be included is\r\nconsiderable; and I have therefore selected those which seem to\r\nillustrate best the different methods of investigation employed by\r\nseismologists, or which are of special interest owing to the unusual\r\ncharacter of their phenomena or to the light cast by them on the\r\nnature and origin of earthquakes in general.\r\n\r\nThus, the Neapolitan earthquake possesses interest from a historical\r\npoint of view; it is the first earthquake in the study of which modern\r\nscientific methods were employed. The Ischian earthquakes are\r\ndescribed as examples of those connected with volcanic action; the\r\nAndalusian earthquake is chiefly remarkable for the recognition of the\r\nunfelt earth-waves; that of Charleston for the detection of the double\r\nepicentre and the calculation of the velocity with which the\r\nvibrations travelled. In the Riviera earthquake are combined the\r\nprincipal features of the last two shocks with several phenomena of\r\nmiscellaneous interest, especially those connected with its submarine\r\nfoci. The Japanese earthquake is distinguished from others by its\r\nextraordinary fault-scarp and the very numerous shocks that followed\r\nit. The Hereford earthquake is a typical example of a twin earthquake,\r\nand provided many observations on the sound phenomena; while the\r\nInverness earthquakes are important on account of their connection\r\nwith the growth of a well-known fault. The great Indian earthquake\r\nowns few, if any, rivals within historical times, whether we consider\r\nthe intensity of the disturbance or the diversity and interest of the\r\nphenomena displayed by it--the widespread changes in the earth's\r\ncrust, both superficial and deep-seated, and the tracking of the\r\nunfelt pulsations completely round the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS AND DEFINITIONS.\r\n\r\nSome terms are of such frequent use in describing earthquakes that it\r\nwill be convenient to group them here for reference, others more\r\nrarely employed being introduced as they are required.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake is caused by a sudden displacement of the material which\r\ncomposes the earth's interior. The displacement gives rise to series\r\nof waves, which are propagated outwards in all directions, and which,\r\nwhen they reach the surface, produce the sensations known to us as\r\nthose of an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe region within which the displacement occurs is sometimes called\r\nthe _hypocentre_, but more frequently the _seismic focus_ or simply\r\nthe _focus_. The portion of the earth's surface which is vertically\r\nabove the seismic focus is called the _epicentre_. The focus and\r\nepicentre are often spoken of for convenience as if they were points,\r\nand they may then be regarded as the centres of the region and area in\r\nwhich the intensity was greatest. This is not quite accurate, but to\r\nattempt a more exact definition would at present be out of place.\r\n\r\nAn _isoseismal line_ is a curve which passes through all points at\r\nwhich the intensity of the shock was the same. It is but rarely that\r\nthe absolute intensity at any point of an isoseismal line can be\r\nascertained, and only one example is given in this volume. As a rule,\r\nthe intensity of a shock is determined by reference to the degrees of\r\ndifferent arbitrary scales. These will be quoted when required.\r\n\r\nIn every strong earthquake there is a central district which differs\r\nin a marked manner from that outside in the far greater strength and\r\ncomplexity of the phenomena. As this district includes the epicentre,\r\nit is sometimes referred to as the _epicentral area_, but the term\r\n_meizoseismal area_ is more appropriate, and will be employed\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThe district over which an earthquake is perceptible to human beings\r\nwithout instrumental aid is its _disturbed area_. In like manner, that\r\nover which the earthquake-sound is heard is the _sound-area_.\r\n\r\nA great earthquake never occurs alone. It is merely the most prominent\r\nmember of a group of shocks of greater or less intensity, and is\r\nknown as the _principal shock_ or _earthquake_, while the others are\r\ncalled _minor_ or _accessory shocks_, and _fore-shocks_ or\r\n_after-shocks_ according as they occur before or after the principal\r\nearthquake. When the sound only is heard, without an accompanying\r\ntremor being anywhere perceptible, it is more accurately called an\r\n_earth-sound_, but is frequently for convenience numbered among the\r\nminor shocks.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Diagram to illustrate simple harmonic\r\n   motion.]\r\n\r\nThe movement of the ground during a vibration of the simplest\r\ncharacter (known as simple harmonic motion) is represented in Fig. 1.\r\nThe pointer of the recording seismograph is here supposed to oscillate\r\nalong a line at right angles to AB, and the smoked paper or glass on\r\nwhich the record is made to travel to the left. The distance MP of the\r\ncrest P of any wave from the line AB represents the _amplitude_ of the\r\nvibration, the sum of the distances MP and NQ its _range_, and the\r\nlength AB the _period_ of the vibration. From the amplitude and period\r\nwe can calculate, in the case of simple harmonic motion, both the\r\n_maximum velocity_ and _maximum acceleration_ of the vibrating\r\nparticles of the ground.[1]\r\n\r\nA few terms describing the nature of the shock are also in common use\r\namong Italians and Spaniards. An _undulatory_ shock consists of one or\r\nseveral waves, the movement to and fro being along a nearly horizontal\r\nline; a _subsultory_ shock of movements in a nearly vertical\r\ndirection; while a _vorticose_ shock consists of undulatory or\r\nsubsultory movements crossing one another in different directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are grouped, according to their origin, into three\r\nclasses. The first consists of slight local shocks, caused by the fall\r\nof rock in underground passages; the second of _volcanic_ earthquakes,\r\nalso local in character, but often of considerable intensity near the\r\ncentre of the disturbed area; while in the third class we have\r\n_tectonic_ earthquakes, or those directly connected with the shaping\r\nof the earth's crust, which vary in strength from the weakest\r\nperceptible tremor to the most destructive and widely felt shock. Of\r\nthe earthquakes described in this volume, the Ischian earthquakes\r\nbelong to the second class, and all the others to the third.\r\n\r\nThat tectonic earthquakes are closely connected with the formation of\r\nfaults seems now established beyond doubt. They occur far from all\r\ntraces of recent volcanic action. Their isoseismal lines are elongated\r\nin directions parallel to known faults, and this is sometimes the case\r\nin one and the same district with faults that occur at right angles to\r\none another. Indeed, when several isoseismals are carefully drawn, it\r\nis possible from their form and relative position to predict the\r\nposition of the originating fault.[2] The initial formation and\r\nfurther spreading of the rent may be the cause of a few earthquakes,\r\nbut by far the larger number are due to the subsequent growth of the\r\nfault. The relative displacement of the rocks adjoining the fault,\r\nwhich may amount to thousands of feet, occasionally even to miles, is\r\nthe result, not of one great movement, but of innumerable slips taking\r\nplace in different parts of the fault and spread over vast ages of\r\ntime. With every fault-slip, intense friction is suddenly brought into\r\naction by the rubbing of one mass of rock against the other; and,\r\naccording to the modern view, it is this friction that gives rise to\r\nthe earthquake waves.\r\n\r\nIn most earthquakes, the slip takes place at a considerable depth,\r\nperhaps not less than one or several miles, and the vertical slip is\r\nso small that it dies out before reaching the surface. But, in a few\r\nviolent earthquakes, such as the Japanese and Indian earthquakes\r\ndescribed in this volume, the slip is continued up to the surface and\r\nis left visible there as a small cliff or fault-scarp. In these cases,\r\nthe sudden spring of the crust may increase and complicate the effects\r\nof the vibratory shock.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] If _a_ is the amplitude of the vibration and T its period, the\r\nmaximum velocity is 2*pi*a/T and the maximum acceleration 4*pi^2a/T^2\r\n\r\n[2] See Chapter VIII., on the Hereford and Inverness earthquakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE NEAPOLITAN EARTHQUAKE OF DECEMBER 16TH, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago, seismology was in its infancy. On the Continent,\r\nAlexis Perrey of Dijon was compiling his earthquake catalogues with\r\nunfailing enthusiasm and industry. In 1846, Robert Mallet applied the\r\nlaws of wave-motion in solids, as they were then known, to the\r\nphenomena of earthquakes; and his memoir on the Dynamics of\r\nEarthquakes[3] may be regarded as the foundation-stone of the new\r\nscience. During the next twelve years he contributed his well-known\r\nReports to the British Association,[4] and prepared a series of\r\ninstructions for the observation and study of earthquake-shocks.[5]\r\nThe latter, it is worth noting, contains an outline, but hardly more\r\nthan an outline, of the methods of investigation which he developed\r\nand employed eight years afterwards in studying the Neapolitan\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nThe history of Mallet's preparation for his great work is somewhat\r\nstrange. No one else at that time possessed so full a knowledge of\r\nearthquake phenomena. It was, however, a knowledge that had little,\r\nif any, foundation in actual experience; for, when he was awakened by\r\nthe British earthquake of November 9th, 1852, he failed to recognise\r\nits seismic character. Although this shock disturbed an area of about\r\n75,000 square miles and was felt in all four parts of the kingdom, the\r\npaucity of observations and the absence of durable records combined in\r\npreventing the successful application of his new modes of study.[6]\r\nNevertheless, with confidence unshaken in their power, he awaited the\r\noccurrence of a more violent shock, but five years had to pass before\r\nhis opportunity came towards the close of 1857.\r\n\r\nSo destructive was the Neapolitan earthquake of this year (Mallet\r\nranks it third among European earthquakes in extent and severity),\r\nthat nearly a week elapsed before any news of it reached the outer\r\nworld. Without further loss of time, he applied for and obtained a\r\ngrant of money from the Council of the Royal Society, and proceeded\r\nearly in the following February to what was then the kingdom of\r\nNaples. Armed with letters of authority to different officials, he\r\nvisited the chief towns and villages in the meizoseismal area; and, in\r\nspite of unfavourable weather and the difficulties of travelling in a\r\ncountry so recently devastated, he completed his examination in little\r\nmore than two months. It was a task, surely, that would have baffled\r\nany but the most enthusiastic investigator or one unspurred by the\r\nfeeling that he possessed the key to one of the most obscure of\r\nNature's problems.\r\n\r\nMallet's confidence in the accuracy of his methods was almost\r\nunbounded. His great report was published four years later; but he\r\nseems to have regarded it almost as a text-book of \"observational\r\nseismology\" and the results of his Neapolitan work as mere\r\nillustrations. His successors, however, have transposed the order of\r\nimportance, and rank his two large volumes as the model, if not the\r\ninspirer, of many of our more recent earthquake monographs.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Isoseismal Lines of the Neapolitan\r\n   Earthquake of 1857. (_Mallet._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nISOSEISMAL LINES AND DISTURBED AREA.\r\n\r\nThe position of the meizoseismal area, to which Mallet devoted most of\r\nhis time, is indicated by the small oval area marked 1 in Fig. 2,\r\nrepresented on a larger scale in Fig. 9. It is 40 miles long and 23\r\nmiles wide,[7] and contains 950 square miles. Within this area, the\r\nloss of life was great and most of the towns were absolutely\r\nprostrated.\r\n\r\nThe next isoseismal, No. 2, which is also shown more clearly in Fig.\r\n9, bounds the area in which the loss of life was still great and many\r\npersons were wounded, while large portions of the towns within it were\r\nthrown down. Its length is 65 miles, width 47 miles, and area 2,240\r\nsquare miles. The third isoseismal includes a district in which\r\nbuildings were only occasionally thrown down, though none escaped some\r\nslight damage, and in which practically no loss of life occurred. This\r\ncurve is 103 miles long, 82 miles wide, and includes 6,615 square\r\nmiles. Lastly, the fourth isoseismal marks the boundary of the\r\ndisturbed area, which is 250 miles long, 210 miles wide, and contains\r\nnot more than 39,200 square miles; an amount that must be regarded as\r\nstrangely small, and hardly justifying Mallet's estimate of the\r\nNeapolitan earthquake as the third among European earthquakes in\r\nextent as well as in seventy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMAGE CAUSED BY THE EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nAs regards destruction to life and property, however, the Neapolitan\r\nearthquake owns but few European rivals. Less favourable conditions\r\nfor withstanding a great shock are seldom, indeed, to be found than\r\nthose possessed by the mediæval towns and villages of the meizoseismal\r\narea. In buildings of every class, the walls are very thick and\r\nconsist as a rule of a coarse, short-bedded, ill-laid rubble masonry,\r\nwithout thorough bonding and connected by mortar of slender cohesion.\r\nThe floors are made of planks coated with a layer of concrete from six\r\nto eight inches thick, the whole weighing from sixty to a hundred\r\npounds per square foot. Only a little less heavy are the roofs, which\r\nare covered with thick tiles secured, except at the ridges, by their\r\nown weight alone. Thus, for the most part, the walls, floors, and\r\nroofs are extremely massive, while the connections of all to\r\nthemselves and to each other are loose and imperfect.\r\n\r\nAgain, the towns, for greater security from attacks in early times,\r\nare generally perched upon the summits and steep flanks of hills,\r\nespecially of the lower spurs that skirt the great mountain ranges;\r\nand the rocking of the hill-sites, in Mallet's opinion, greatly\r\naggravated the natural effects of the shock. The streets, moreover,\r\nare steep and narrow, sometimes only five feet, and not often more\r\nthan fifteen feet, in width; and the houses, when shaken down, fell\r\nagainst one another and upon those beneath them. As Dolomieu said of\r\nthe great earthquake in 1783, \"the ground was shaken down like ashes\r\nor sand laid upon a table.\"\r\n\r\nOf the total amount of damage, not even the roughest estimate can be\r\nmade. The official returns are clearly, and no doubt purposely,\r\ndeficient, and obstacles were placed in Mallet's way when he\r\nendeavoured to ascertain the numbers of persons killed and wounded.\r\nTaking only the towns into account, he calculated that, out of a total\r\npopulation of 207,000, the number of persons killed was 9,589, and of\r\nwounded 1,343.[8] A few towns were marked by an excessively high\r\ndeath-rate. Thus, at Montemurro, 5000 out of 7002 persons were killed\r\nand 500 wounded; at Saponara, 2000 out of 4010 were killed; and, at\r\nPolla, more than 2000 out of a population of less than 7000.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBJECTS OF INVESTIGATION.\r\n\r\nThe principal objects of Mallet's investigation were to determine the\r\nposition of the epicentre and the depth of the seismic focus. If, in\r\nFig. 3, F represents the seismic focus (here, for convenience,\r\nsupposed to be a point), the vertical line FE will cut the surface of\r\nthe earth in the epicentre E.[9] The dotted lines represent circles\r\ndrawn on the surface of the earth with E as centre and passing through\r\nthe places P and Q.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Diagram to illustrate wave-path and angle\r\n   of emergence.]\r\n\r\nWhen the impulse causing the earthquake takes place at the focus, two\r\nelastic waves spread outwards from it in all directions through the\r\nearth's crust. The first wave which reaches a point P consists of\r\nlongitudinal vibrations, that is, the particle of rock at P moves in a\r\nclosed curve with its longer axis in the direction FP. Mallet supposes\r\nthis curve to be so elongated that it is practically a straight line\r\ncoincident in direction with FP. In the second or transversal wave,\r\nthe vibration of the particle at P takes place in a plane at right\r\nangles to FP. These vibrations Mallet, for his main purpose, neglects.\r\n\r\nReturning to the longitudinal wave, Mallet calls the line FP the\r\n_wave-path_ at P. The direction EP gives the azimuth of the wave-path,\r\nor its direction along the surface of the earth. The angle LPA, or\r\nEPF, he defines as the _angle of emergence_ at the point P. If Q be\r\nfarther from E than P, the angle EQF is less than the angle EPF, or\r\nthe angle of emergence diminishes as the distance from the epicentre\r\nincreases. At the epicentre, the angle of emergence is a right-angle;\r\nat a great distance from the epicentre, it is nearly zero.\r\n\r\nMallet argued that the direction of the wave-path FPA, or its\r\nequivalents, the horizontal direction EPL and the angle of emergence\r\nEPF, should be discoverable from the effects of the shock at P. The\r\ncracks in damaged buildings, he urged, would be at right angles to the\r\nwave-path FPA; overturned monuments or gate-pillars should fall along\r\nthe line EPL, either towards or from the epicentre according to their\r\nconditions of support; loose or slightly attached bodies, such as the\r\nstone balls surmounting gate-pillars, should be projected nearly in\r\nthe direction of the wave-path FPA, and their subsequent positions,\r\nsupposing the balls not to have rolled, should give the horizontal\r\ndirection EPL of the wave-path, and might, in some circumstances,\r\ndetermine the angle of emergence and the velocity with which they were\r\nprojected. I shall return to details later on. For the present, it is\r\nclear that, in the destruction wrought by the earthquake, Mallet\r\nexpected to find the materials most valuable for his purpose. Indeed,\r\nso obvious did this mode of examination appear to him, that he could\r\nnot conceal his surprise at the blindness of his predecessors. They\r\nseem, he says, \"to have been perfectly unconscious that in the\r\nfractured walls and overthrown objects scattered in all directions\r\nbeneath their eyes, they had the most precious data for determining\r\nthe velocities and directions of the shocks that produced them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE EPICENTRE.\r\n\r\n_Mallet's Method of Determining the Position of the Epicentre._--In\r\nmany cases the examination of a damaged building or of an overthrown\r\nbody served more than one purpose, providing materials for\r\nascertaining the depth of the seismic focus as well as the position of\r\nthe epicentre. For the present, however, it will be convenient to\r\nconsider alone the method by which the latter object was to be\r\nattained.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Diagram to illustrate Mallet's method of\r\n   determining position of epicentre.]\r\n\r\nNothing could be simpler than the principle of the method proposed.\r\nThe horizontal direction PL of the wave-path at any place P (Fig. 4),\r\nwhen produced backwards, must pass through the epicentre E; and the\r\nintersection of the directions at two places, P and Q, must therefore\r\ngive the position of the epicentre. In practice, it is of course\r\nimpossible to determine the direction with very great accuracy, and\r\nMallet therefore found it necessary to make several measurements in\r\nevery place, and to visit all the more important towns within and near\r\nthe meizoseismal area.\r\n\r\nIn a ruined town there are many objects from which the direction may\r\nbe ascertained, the most important of all, according to Mallet, being\r\nfissures in walls that are fractured but not overthrown. He regarded\r\nsuch fissures, indeed, as \"the sheet-anchor, as respects direction of\r\nwave-path, to the seismologist in the field,\" and at least three out\r\nof every four of his determinations of the direction were made by\r\ntheir means. If the buildings are detached and large, simple and\r\nsymmetrical in form, well built and not too much injured, the fissures\r\nin the walls should, he argued, occur along lines at right angles to\r\nthe wave-path, whether that path be parallel or inclined to the\r\nprincipal axis of the building. Cracks in the floors and ceilings\r\nshould also be similarly directed, and provide evidence which Mallet\r\nregarded as only second in value to that given by the walls.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Plan of Cathedral Church at Potenza.\r\n   (_Mallet._)]\r\n\r\nNo building showed the different kinds of evidence on which Mallet\r\nrelied as clearly as the cathedral church at Potenza, the plan of\r\nwhich is given in Fig. 5, and the vertical section along its axis in\r\nFig. 12. This is a modern work, nearly 200 feet long, with its axis\r\ndirected east and west. The walls are composed of fairly good rubble\r\nmasonry and brick; and the arches in the nave and transepts, the\r\nsemi-cylindrical roof and the central dome are made of brick. The\r\nfissures represented in both diagrams were drawn to scale by the\r\ncathedral architect before Mallet's arrival, and, as the work of an\r\nunbiassed observer, are of special value. Most of those in the roof,\r\nit will be seen, were transverse to the axial line of the church; but\r\nthere were others parallel to this line, one in particular running\r\nright along the soffit of the nave and chancel. There were also\r\nnumerous small fissures in the dome, due to local structural causes\r\nand therefore of varying direction, and a large portion of the dome\r\nslipped westward, leaving open fissures of seven to eight inches in\r\nwidth. The mean direction of the wave-path, as deduced from nine sets\r\nof fissures, none of which differs more than four degrees from the\r\nmean, is W. 2-1/2° S. and E. 2-1/2° N., which corresponds precisely\r\nwith the direction of throw on the displaced portion of the dome. The\r\ngreat east and west fissures in the arch of the nave and chancel\r\nMallet attributed to a second shock, of the existence of which there\r\nis ample evidence.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Fallen gate-pillars near Saponara.\r\n   (_Mallet._)]\r\n\r\nNext to fissures, Mallet made most use of overthrown objects, such as\r\nthe two gate piers near Saponara, represented in Fig. 6. They were\r\nmade of rubble ashlar masonry, three feet square and seven feet in\r\nheight. Both were fractured clean off at the level of the ground, the\r\nmortar being poor, and fell in directions that were accurately\r\nparallel, indicating a wave-path towards S. 39-1/2°E. A few\r\nobservations were also made on projected stones, fissures in nearly\r\nlevel ground, and the swinging of lamps and chandeliers; but their\r\nvalue was small, except as corroboration of the more important\r\nevidence afforded by fissures in the walls and roofs of buildings.\r\n\r\n_Remarks on Mallets Method._--It would have been more difficult in\r\nMallet's day than it is now, to offer objections to his method of\r\ndetermining the position of the epicentre. The focus, as he was well\r\naware, could not be a point, and, at places near the epicentre (the\r\nvery places where most of his observations were made), there must be\r\nrapid changes of direction due to the arrival of vibrations from\r\ndifferent parts of the focus. He records the occurrence of the\r\nso-called vorticose shocks at several places, though he attributes\r\nthem to another cause. Perhaps the best known example of such a shock\r\nis that which has been so well illustrated by the late Professor\r\nSekiya's model of the motion of an earth-particle during the Japanese\r\nearthquake of January 15th, 1887. The motion in this case was so\r\ncomplicated that the model was, for simplicity, made in three parts,\r\nthe first of which alone is represented in Fig. 7.[10] It is clear\r\nthat in such an earthquake, Mallet's method would utterly fail in\r\ngiving definite results.\r\n\r\nWhile this shock was one of great complexity, another Japanese\r\nearthquake, that of June 20th, 1894, was unusually simple in\r\ncharacter. The movement at Tokio consisted of one very prominent\r\noscillation with a total range of 73 mm. or 2.9 inches in the\r\ndirection S. 70° W.; the vibrations which preceded and followed it\r\nbeing comparatively small. Most, if not all, of the damage caused by\r\nthe earthquake must have been due to this great oscillation; and yet\r\nthe cylindrical stone-lamps so common in Japanese gardens were found\r\nby Professor Omori to have fallen in many different directions. Taking\r\nonly those which had circular bases, twenty-nine were overthrown in\r\ndirections between north and east, sixteen between east and south,\r\neighty-one between south and west, and fourteen between west and\r\nnorth.[11] Fig. 8 represents Professor Omori's results graphically,\r\nthe line drawn from O to any point being proportional to the number of\r\nlamps which fell in directions between 7-1/2° on either side of the\r\nline.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Model to illustrate the motion of an\r\n   earth-particle during an earthquake. (_Sekiya._)]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Plan of directions of fall of overturned\r\n   stone-lamps at Tokio during the earthquake of 1894.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this figure that most of the stone lamps fell in\r\ndirections between west and south-west, and it is remarkable that the\r\nmean direction of fall is S. 70° W.,[12] which is exactly the same as\r\nthat of the great oscillation. Somewhat similar results were obtained\r\nby this able seismologist at different places affected by the great\r\nJapanese earthquake of 1891 (Figs. 43 and 44), and the study of the\r\napparent directions observed during the Hereford earthquake of 1896\r\nleads to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that an isolated observation may give a result very\r\ndifferent from the true direction. Indeed, if we may judge from\r\nProfessor Omori's measurements in 1894, the chance that a single\r\ndirection may be within five degrees of the mean direction is about 1\r\nin 9. But, on the other hand, it is equally clear from these and other\r\nobservations that the mean of a large number of measurements will give\r\na result that agrees very closely with the true direction.\r\n\r\nOne other point may be alluded to before leaving Professor Omori's\r\ninteresting observations. It would seem, from the list that he gives,\r\nthat he exercised no selection in his measurements, but continued\r\nmeasuring the direction of every fallen lamp indifferently until he\r\nhad obtained sufficient records for his purpose. Now, if the number of\r\nfallen lamps at his disposal had been small, say 12 instead of 144,\r\nthe mean observed direction would probably have differed from the\r\ndirection given from the seismograph.[13] But, on the other hand, a\r\npreliminary survey without any actual measurements would have revealed\r\nat once the predominant direction of overthrow, and a fairly accurate\r\nresult might have been obtained by neglecting discordant directions\r\nand taking the mean of those only which appeared to agree with the\r\nmentally determined average.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, appears to have been the course followed, more or less\r\nunconsciously, by Mallet in his Neapolitan work. \"When the observer,\"\r\nhe says, \"first enters upon one of those earthquake-shaken towns, he\r\nfinds himself in the midst of utter confusion. The eye is bewildered\r\nby 'a city become an heap.' He wanders over masses of dislocated stone\r\nand mortar, with timbers half buried, prostrate, or standing stark up\r\nagainst the light, and is appalled by spectacles of desolation....\r\nHouses seem to have been precipitated to the ground in every direction\r\nof azimuth. There seems no governing law, nor any indication of a\r\nprevailing direction of overturning force. It is only by first gaining\r\nsome commanding point, whence a general view over the whole field of\r\nruin can be had, and observing its places of greatest and least\r\ndestruction, and then by patient examination, compass in hand, of many\r\ndetails of overthrow, house by house and street by street, analysing\r\neach detail and comparing the results, as to the direction of force,\r\nthat must have produced each particular fall, with those previously\r\nobserved and compared, that we at length perceive, once for all, that\r\nthis apparent confusion is but superficial.\"\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Meizoseismal area of Neapolitan\r\n   earthquake. (_Mallet._)]\r\n\r\n_Mallet's Determination of the Epicentre._--Within the third\r\nisoseismal line Mallet made altogether 177 measurements of the\r\ndirection of the wave-path at 78 places. These are plotted on his\r\ngreat map of the earthquake; but, owing to the small scale of Fig. 9,\r\nit is only possible to represent, by means of short lines, the mean or\r\nmost trustworthy direction at each place.[14] Producing these\r\ndirections backwards, he found that those at sixteen places passed\r\nwithin five hundred yards of a point which is practically coincident\r\nwith the village of Caggiano; those at sixteen other places passed\r\nwithin one geographical mile (1.153 statute miles) of this point; the\r\ndirections at sixteen more places within two and a half geographical\r\nmiles; while those at twelve places passed through points not more\r\nthan five geographical miles from Caggiano. As the direction of the\r\nshock at places near the epicentre must have been influenced by the\r\nmere size of the focus, this approximate coincidence is certainly\r\nremarkable, and there can be little doubt, I think, that the\r\nepicentre, or, at any rate, _an_ epicentre must have been situated not\r\nfar from the position assigned to it by Mallet's laborious\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\n_Existence of Two Epicentres._--It is difficult, however, to realise\r\nthat the impulse at the focus corresponding to Mallet's epicentre was\r\nthe origin of all the destruction of life and property that occurred.\r\nThe position of the epicentre close to the north-west boundary of the\r\nmeizoseismal area, the extraordinary extension of that area towards\r\nthe south-east, and especially the great loss of life at Montemurro\r\nand the adjoining towns, can hardly be accounted for in this manner.\r\nMallet himself recognised that these facts required explanation, and\r\nhe suggested that the situation and character of the towns were in\r\npart responsible for their ruin, and the physical structure of the\r\ncountry for the course of the isoseismal lines. But the comparative\r\nescape of places much nearer Caggiano, and the wide extent of the\r\nmeizoseismal area, embracing many towns and villages of varied\r\ncharacter and site and many different surface-features, point\r\nunmistakably to a different explanation.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Distribution of death-rate within\r\n   meizoseismal area of Neapolitan earthquake.]\r\n\r\nOne clue to the solution of the problem is afforded by the seismic\r\ndeath-rate of the damaged towns. From a table given by Mallet (vol.\r\nii. pp. 162-163), we know the population before the earthquake of the\r\ndifferent communes in the province of Basilicata, and the loss of life\r\nin each due to the shock; and from these figures we can find the\r\npercentage of deaths at nearly every place of importance. As will be\r\nseen from Fig. 10, it varies from seventy-one at Montemurro and fifty\r\nat Saponara down to less than one at all the places marked to which\r\nfigures are not attached. There is thus a group of places, with its\r\ncentre near Montemurro, where the loss of life far exceeded that in\r\nthe surrounding country; and also a slightly less-marked group, with\r\nits centre near Polla, in the north-west of the meizoseismal area;\r\nwhile in the intermediate region the death-rate was invariably small.\r\nToo much stress should not be laid upon the exact figures, for there\r\nwere no doubt local conditions that affected the death-roll. But it\r\nseems clear that one focus was situated not far from Montemurro; while\r\nthe north-westerly group of places, combined with Mallet's\r\nobservations on the direction, point to a second focus near Polla,\r\nabout twenty-four miles to the north-west. It will be seen in a later\r\nsection that the observations on the nature of the shock also imply\r\nthe existence of a double focus.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF THE SEISMIC FOCUS.\r\n\r\n_Mallet's Method of Determining the Depth of the Focus._--In\r\nascertaining the position of the epicentre, Mallet's work was\r\nremarkable only for the novelty of the method employed by him; but, in\r\nhis attempt to calculate the depth of the seismic focus, he was\r\nbreaking new ground. That the depth must be comparatively small had\r\nalready been recognised, and was indeed obvious from the limited area\r\ndisturbed by nearly every earthquake. No one, however, had tried to\r\nestimate the depth in miles; and it is impossible not to sympathise\r\nwith Mallet while he accumulated his observations with feverish\r\nactivity and subjected them to the first rough examination even if\r\none cannot share his confidence that he had succeeded in measuring the\r\ndepth \"in miles and yards with the certainty that belongs to an\r\nordinary geodetic operation.\"\r\n\r\nThe method employed by him for the purpose is no less simple\r\ntheoretically than that used for locating the epicentre. If the\r\nposition of the latter (E) is known, one accurate measurement of the\r\nangle of emergence EPF, at any other point P would be sufficient to\r\nfix the depth of some point within the focus F (Fig. 11). Here, again,\r\nMallet relied chiefly on fissures in walls that were fractured but not\r\noverthrown. In detail, these fissures are nearly always jagged or\r\nserrated, for they tend to follow the lines of joints rather than\r\nbreak through the solid stone, though they sometimes traverse bricks\r\nand mortar alike. But the general course of the fissures, he urged,\r\nwould be at right angles to the wave-path, and their inclination to\r\nthe vertical should be equal to the angle of emergence.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Diagram to illustrate Mallet's method of\r\n   determining depth of seismic focus.]\r\n\r\nIn obtaining measurements of this angle, the buildings to be chosen\r\nare those of large size, with few windows or other apertures, and with\r\nwalls made of brick or small short-bedded stones. The cathedral-church\r\nat Potenza perhaps satisfies these conditions more closely than any\r\nother structure examined by Mallet. The plan of the fissures in the\r\nwalls and roof has been given in Fig. 5, and Fig. 12 represents the\r\nfissures In the vertical section along the axial line and looking\r\nnorth, as drawn by the cathedral architect. From these fissures Mallet\r\ncalculated the mean angle of emergence at Potenza to be 23° 7'. The\r\ndistance of Potenza from Caggiano being seventeen miles, and the\r\nheight of the former being 2,580 feet, the depth of the focus\r\nresulting from this observation alone would be 6-3/4 miles below the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Vertical section of Cathedral Church at\r\n   Potenza. (_Mallet._)]\r\n\r\n_Objection to Mallet's Method._--The weakest point in Mallet's method\r\nis probably his assumption that the wave-paths are straight lines\r\nextending outward from the focus. Even if the depth of the focus is\r\nnot more than a few miles, the waves must traverse rocks of varying\r\ndensity and elasticity, and, at every bounding surface, they must\r\nundergo refraction. If the rocks are so constituted that the velocity\r\nof the earth-waves in them increases with the depth, then the\r\nwave-paths must be bent continually outwards from the vertical, so\r\nthat the angle of emergence at the surface may be considerably less\r\nthan it would have been with a constant velocity throughout. In this\r\ncase, the actual depth will be greater, perhaps much greater, than the\r\ncalculated depth. For instance, if the angle of emergence at Potenza\r\nwere diminished only 5° by refraction, the calculated depth of the\r\nfocus would be too small by 1-3/4 miles.\r\n\r\n_Mallet's Estimate of the Depth of the Focus._--Mallet measured the\r\nangle of emergence at twenty-six places, the mean angle (_i.e._ the\r\nmean of the greatest and least observed angles) varying from 72° at\r\nVietri di Potenza and 70° at Pertosa, which are about two miles from\r\nthe calculated epicentre, to 11-1/2° at Salerno, distant about 40\r\nmiles. Fig. 13 reproduces part of the diagram on which he plotted the\r\nmean angle of emergence at different places. The horizontal line\r\nrepresents the level of the sea, and the vertical line one passing\r\nthrough the epicentre and focus, called by Mallet the \"seismic\r\nvertical.\" The lines on the left-hand side represent the commencing\r\nwave-paths (assumed straight) to the observing stations situated to\r\nthe westward of the meridian through the epicentre, those on the\r\nright-hand side corresponding to places to the eastward of the same\r\nmeridian. Small horizontal marks are added to indicate the depth in\r\nmiles below the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Diagram of wave-paths at seismic\r\n   vertical of Neopolitan earthquake. (_Mallet._)]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, from this diagram, that all the wave-paths start from\r\nthe seismic vertical at depths between three and nine miles; but the\r\npoints of departure are clustered thickly within a portion, the length\r\nof which is about 3-1/2 miles and the mean depth about 6-1/2 miles. So\r\ngreat was Mallet's confidence in these calculations that he assigns\r\nthe diverging origin of the wave-paths to different points of the\r\nfocus, and thus concludes that, while the mean depth of the focus was\r\nabout 6-1/2 miles, its dimensions in a vertical direction did not\r\nexceed 3-1/2 miles.\r\n\r\nHow far Mallet's results should be accepted as correct, it is\r\ndifficult to say in our ignorance of the constitution of the earth's\r\ninterior. There can be no doubt that the focus was of considerable\r\nsize, and that, in consequence, the wave-paths would diverge from\r\ndifferent points of it. But that each wave-path should actually\r\nintersect the focus, and so enable its magnitude to be determined,\r\nwould surely involve an approach to some law connecting the direction\r\nof a wave-path with the depth of its own origin, and no such law seems\r\nto be ascertainable. Nor can the limitation of these apparent origins\r\nbetween certain depths be held to argue that the focus, or any part of\r\nit, was equally confined, for the wave-paths would to a great extent\r\nbe similarly refracted. I fear that the only conclusions that we can\r\nwith safety draw from Mallet's admirable work are that his figures\r\nindicate the order of magnitude both of the vertical dimensions and of\r\nthe mean depth of the focus.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to form any precise image of the earthquake as it\r\nappeared to the terrified witnesses within the meizoseismal area. To\r\nminds unbalanced by the suddenness of the shock and by the crash of\r\nfalling houses, actuated too by the intense need of safety, the mere\r\nsuccession of events must have presented but little interest. The\r\ninterval of two months that elapsed between the occurrence of the\r\nearthquake and its investigation was also unfavourable to the\r\ncollection of accurate accounts from a wonder-loving people. Only one\r\nfeature, therefore, stands out clearly in the few records given by\r\nMallet--namely, the division of the shock into two distinct parts.\r\n\r\nIn the central district, this division is perhaps less apparent than\r\nelsewhere. At Polla, for instance, which lies close to the north-west\r\nepicentre, the first warning was given by a rushing sound; almost\r\ninstantly, and while it was yet heard, came a strong subsultory or\r\nup-and-down movement, succeeded after a few seconds, but without any\r\ninterval, by an undulatory motion. At Potenza, which is not far from\r\nthe same epicentre but a few miles outside the meizoseismal area, the\r\nseparation was more pronounced. According to one observer, the first\r\nmovement was from west to east; and, within a second or two\r\nafterwards, there was a less violent shock in a transverse direction,\r\nfollowed immediately by a shaking in all directions, called by the\r\nItalians vorticose. Naples lies sixty-nine miles from the north-west\r\nepicentre, and here more accurate observations could be made. Dr.\r\nLardner, well known fifty years ago as a writer of scientific works,\r\ndescribes the first movement felt there as \"a short, jarring,\r\nhorizontal oscillation, that made all doors and windows rattle, and\r\nthe floors and furniture creak. This ceased, and after an interval\r\nthat seemed but a few seconds was renewed with greater violence, and,\r\nhe thought, with a distinctly undulatory movement, 'like that in the\r\ncabin of a small vessel in a very short chopping sea.'\"\r\n\r\nIn five other earthquakes studied in this volume, the separation of\r\nthe shock into two parts was a well-marked phenomenon. In the\r\nNeapolitan earthquake, the separation was so distinct that Mallet took\r\nsome pains to account for its origin. He regarded it in every case as\r\ndue to the reflection or refraction of the earth-waves by underlying\r\nrocks, though he does not explain why the reflected or refracted wave\r\nshould be more intense than that transmitted directly. I shall refer\r\nto the subject in greater detail when describing the Andalusian,\r\nCharleston, Riviera, and Hereford earthquakes. For the present, it may\r\nbe sufficient to urge that the double shock cannot have been due to\r\nthe separation of the original waves by underground reflection or\r\nrefraction, for then the second part should have been generally the\r\nweaker; nor to the succession of longitudinal and transverse waves,\r\nfor, in that case, every earthquake-shock should be duplicated. The\r\nonly remaining supposition is that there was a second impulse\r\noccurring either in the same or in a different focus.\r\n\r\nWhich alternative should be adopted, the evidence on the nature of the\r\nshock is too scanty to determine. The defect is, however, supplemented\r\nby Mallet's observations on the direction of motion; for, at many\r\nplaces within and near the meizoseismal area, he met with the clearest\r\nsigns of a double direction. Sometimes this was apparent to the senses\r\nof the observer; in other cases, damaged buildings presented two sets\r\nof fissures. At La Sala and near Padula, the first movement was roughly\r\neast and west, the second north and south. At Moliterno, there was\r\nevidence of a subordinate shock at right angles to the chief one; in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Tramutola, its direction was from about E. 30° S.\r\nIn these and other cases, Mallet saw the effects of earthquake-echoes;\r\nbut the underground reflection of earth-waves would give rise to the\r\nsecond part of the shock, not the first as at La Sala and Padula.\r\nMoreover, the secondary directions, though they are seldom recorded\r\naccurately, point nearly to an epicentre not far from Montemurro. The\r\nobservations on the nature and direction of the double shock thus\r\nconfirm the conclusion, derived from the distribution of the seismic\r\ndeath-rate, that there were two detached foci, one near Polla and the\r\nother near Montemurro.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the best explanation of the facts recorded by Mallet.\r\nThere is, however, a possible difficulty that should not be\r\noverlooked--namely, the apparently slight influence of the Montemurro\r\nfocus on the mean direction of the shock (Fig. 9). At a few places, of\r\ncourse, the mean direction passes through both epicentres; at some\r\nothers, as we have seen, one of the two observed directions points\r\ntowards the Montemurro epicentre. It is not impossible, also, that\r\nMallet, after the first few days' work, may occasionally have quite\r\nunconsciously selected and measured those fissures from the maze\r\npresented to him which agreed most closely with his early impressions\r\nobtained from the neighbourhood of Polla. But, for places nearer Polla\r\nthan Montemurro (and these form the majority of those visited by\r\nMallet), the probable explanation of the difficulty is that the\r\nMontemurro focus was not so deep as the Polla focus. This, as will\r\nappear more fully in the next chapter, would account for the\r\ncomparatively great intensity in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nMontemurro and for its rapid decline outwards; and it receives some\r\nsupport from an isolated reference by Mallet to two angles of\r\nemergence at Padula, one of 25° from the north, and the other of 8° or\r\n10° in the perpendicular walls.\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMENTS OF THE WAVE-MOTION.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the wave-motion, as mentioned in the introductory\r\nchapter, are four in number, namely, the period, amplitude, maximum\r\nvelocity, and maximum acceleration. If any two of these are known for\r\neach vibration--and the first two are now given by every accurately\r\nconstructed seismograph--the others can be determined if the\r\nvibrations follow the law of simple harmonic motion.[15]\r\n\r\n_Amplitude._--To ascertain the amplitude, Mallet had to rely chiefly\r\non the fissures made in very inelastic walls. If the parts into which\r\nsuch a wall are fractured are free to move, and yet, being inelastic,\r\nobliged to remain in the farthest position to which they are carried\r\nby the wave, the distance traversed by the centre of gravity of one of\r\nthe displaced parts should give a \"rude approximate measure\" of the\r\nhorizontal amplitude of the earth-wave. At Certosa, near Padula, he\r\nthus found the amplitude to be about 4 inches, at Sarconi about 4-3/4\r\ninches, and at Tramutola about 4-1/2 inches. From somewhat similar\r\nevidence, the amplitude at Polla appears to have been about 2-1/2 or 3\r\ninches; and, from the oscillation of a suspended clock or watch on a\r\nrough wall, about 3-1/2 inches at La Sala and 1-3/4 inches at\r\nBarielle. With the exception of Barielle, these places lie nearly on a\r\nstraight line passing through Mallet's epicentre, and he gives the\r\nfollowing table, showing an increase in amplitude with the distance\r\nfrom the epicentre:--\r\n\r\n                     Polla.  La Sala.  Certosa.  Tramutola.  Sarconi.\r\n\r\nDistance in miles     4.0      13.4      19.0       23.8       30.8\r\nAmplitude in inches   2-1/2    3-1/2      4         4-1/2      4-3/4\r\n\r\nThe existence of the Montemurro focus must, however, complicate any\r\nrelation that may connect these two quantities.\r\n\r\n_Maximum Velocity._--The means at Mallet's disposal for determining\r\nthe maximum velocity were more numerous than those available for the\r\namplitude. From the dimensions of a fallen column of regular form we\r\nshould be able, he remarks, to find an inferior limit to the value of\r\nthe maximum velocity; while a superior limit at the same place may be\r\nobtained from some other regular solid which escaped being overthrown.\r\nIf a loose body is projected by the shock at a place where the angle\r\nof emergence is known, the horizontal and vertical distances traversed\r\nby the centre of gravity will give the velocity of projection. Or, if\r\ntwo such bodies are projected at one place, the same measures for each\r\nwill as a rule give both the angle of emergence and the velocity of\r\nprojection. A third method depends on the fissuring of walls,\r\nsupposing that we know the force per unit surface which, when suddenly\r\napplied, is just sufficient to produce fracture. Sometimes more than\r\none method must be applied to the same object. The two gate-pillars\r\nnear Saponara (illustrated in Fig. 6) for example required a\r\nhorizontal velocity of 5.48 feet per second to fracture them, and an\r\nadditional velocity of 5.14 feet per second to overthrow them.\r\n\r\nThe well-known seismologist, Professor Milne, urges very forcibly that\r\nmeasurements obtained from the projection or fall of columns are\r\nunreliable, for the earlier tremors might cause the columns to rock,\r\nand their overthrow need not therefore measure accurately the maximum\r\nvelocity of the critical vibration.[16] There can be no doubt that\r\nMallet was alive to this difficulty, though he may not have\r\nappreciated it at its full value. Thus, at the Certosa de St. Lorenzo,\r\na monastery near Padula, a vase projected from the summit of a slender\r\ngate-pier implied a velocity of 21-3/4 feet per second; and the excess\r\nof about 8-1/4 feet per second above the velocity determined by other\r\nmeans is attributed by him to the oscillation of the pier itself. How\r\nfar this source of error enters into other observations it is\r\nimpossible to say; but it is worth noticing how closely the velocities\r\nobtained by different methods agree with one another. Thus, from\r\nprojection only, we have velocities of 11.5 feet per second at the\r\nCertosa, 11.8 at Moliterno and Monticchio, 14.8 at Tramutola, and 9.8\r\nfeet per second at Sarconi; from overthrow alone, 11.0 feet per second\r\nat Viscolione, near Saponara, and 11.6 at Barielle; from overthrow and\r\nprojection, 13.2 feet per second at Polla and 12.9 at Padula; from\r\nfracture and overthrow, 12.3 feet per second at Potenza and 15.6 at\r\nSaponara. The comparatively high values at Tramutola and Saponara,\r\nMallet imagined might be due to the oscillation of the hills on which\r\nthese towns are built. He therefore omits them in calculating the mean\r\nmaximum velocity, which he finds to be twelve feet per second, a\r\nvelocity less than that with which a man reaches the ground when he\r\njumps off a table.\r\n\r\nWith the same omissions, Mallet gives the following table, showing a\r\ngeneral decrease in the maximum velocity as the distance from his\r\nepicentre increases:--\r\n\r\n              Polla. Padula. Certosa. Moliterno. Viscolione. Sarconi.\r\n\r\nDistance in\r\nmiles           4.0   19.0    19.0      29.4        30.0       30.8\r\n\r\nMax. vel. in\r\nft. per sec.   13.2   12.9    11.5      11.8        11.0        9.8\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the epicentre we have:--\r\n\r\n                           Potenza.   Monticchio.   Barielle.\r\n\r\nDistance in miles            17.3        27.1         28.2\r\nMax. vel. in ft. per sec.    12.3        11.8         11.6\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible that the high calculated velocities at Tramutola\r\nand Saponara were partly or entirely due to the impulse from the\r\nMontemurro focus.\r\n\r\nIf we take 4 inches for the amplitude of the largest variation, and 12\r\nfeet per second for the maximum velocity, and assume the motion to\r\nhave been of a simple harmonic character, the period of a complete\r\nvibration would be less than one-fifth of a second.[17] Now, we know\r\nfrom seismographic records that this is roughly the period of the\r\nsmall tremors that form the commencement of an earthquake-shock, while\r\nthe period of the largest vibrations may amount to as much as one or\r\ntwo seconds. We may therefore conclude either that the assumption of\r\nsimple harmonic motion is incorrect, or that the maximum velocity is\r\ntoo great, or more probably perhaps that the amplitude is too\r\nsmall.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND-PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\nMallet was one of the first seismologists to realise the significance\r\nof the earthquake-sound; and he attended closely to the subject,\r\nthough finding the sound even more elusive of precise observation\r\nthan the shock.\r\n\r\nThe chief result obtained by him was the comparative smallness of the\r\narea over which the sound was heard. He estimates it at little more\r\nthan 3,300 square miles, or about one-twelfth of that over which the\r\nshock was felt. It extends north and south from Melfi to Lagonegro,\r\nand east and west from Monte Peloso to Duchessa and Senerchia. The\r\nsound was thus confined to the region in which the shock attained its\r\nmost destructive character.\r\n\r\nTowards the north and south ends of the sound-area all observers\r\ndescribed the sound as a low, grating, heavy, sighing rush, lasting\r\nfrom twenty to sixty seconds, some adding that it was also of a\r\nrumbling nature. Near the centre and the east and west boundaries, the\r\nsound was distinctly more rumbling; it was shorter in duration, and\r\nbegan and ended more abruptly.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake, Mallet remarks, \"began everywhere with tremors; the\r\nsounds generally arrived at the same time; the apparent direction of\r\nmovement of the tremulous oscillations appeared rapidly to change, and\r\nstill more rapidly to increase in amplitude; then the great _shove_ of\r\nthe destructive shock arrived, in some places rather before, in some a\r\nlittle after, the moment of loudest sound, and it died away suddenly\r\n(_i.e._, with extreme rapidity) into tremors again, but differing in\r\ndirection from that of the great shock itself.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThe earthquake-sound will be described more fully in the chapter\r\ndealing with the Hereford earthquake of 1896, in which it will be\r\nfound that the phenomena recorded by Mallet are equally characteristic\r\nof the slighter shocks felt in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF THE EARTH-WAVES.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 little was known about the velocity of earthquake-waves.\r\nExperiments had been made by Mallet himself in 1849 in the\r\nneighbourhood of Dublin. These gave 825 feet per second for the\r\nvelocity in dense wet sand, 1,306 feet per second in discontinuous\r\ngranite, and 1,665 feet per second in more solid granite.[20] The only\r\nearthquake for which the velocity had been calculated was the Rhenish\r\nearthquake of 1846, the value ascertained by Schmidt being 1,376\r\nFrench feet, or 1,466 English feet, per second.\r\n\r\nThe accurate public measurement of time, which, as Mallet remarks, is\r\none of the surest indications of advancing civilisation, was, however,\r\nunknown in the kingdom of Naples; and his attempt was therefore\r\nfettered by the rarity of precise estimates of the time of occurrence.\r\nThroughout the whole disturbed area only six good records could be\r\nobtained, and three of these (at Vietri di Potenza, Atella, and\r\nNaples) were derived from stopped clocks, witnesses of rather doubtful\r\nvalue. At Montefermo and Barielle the time was at once read from a\r\nwatch, and at Melfi from an accurate pocket chronometer. The times\r\ngiven vary from 9h. 59m. 16s. P.M. (Naples mean time) at Vietri di\r\nPotenza to 10h. 7m. 44s. at Naples. Allowing for the supposed change\r\nof direction by refraction at the Monte St. Angelo range on the way\r\nto Naples, Mallet finds the mean surface velocity to be 787 feet per\r\nsecond. Omitting the Naples record, and taking account of the\r\ncalculated depth of the focus, the mean velocity becomes 804 feet per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR SHOCKS.\r\n\r\nA great earthquake rarely, if ever, occurs without some preparation in\r\nthe form of a marked increase of seismic activity. Perrey records\r\nseveral shocks during the two years 1856-57 that were felt at places\r\nas far apart as Naples, Melfi, and Cosenza. On December 7th, 1857, a\r\nslight shock, with a report from beneath like the explosion of a mine,\r\nwas felt at Potenza. Then came the great earthquake on December 16th,\r\nat about 10 P.M.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by numerous after-shocks--how numerous it is\r\nimpossible to say, for the records are of the scantiest description.\r\nFor some hours the ground within the meizoseismal area is said to have\r\ntrembled almost incessantly. At Potenza many slight shocks, both\r\nvertical and horizontal, were felt during the night, and for a month\r\nor more they were so frequent as to render enumeration difficult.\r\nMallet's last record is dated March 23rd, 1858, when four slight\r\nshocks were felt at La Sala and Potenza, but occasional tremors were\r\nreported to him until May 1859.\r\n\r\nThe most important of all these after-shocks was one felt about an\r\nhour after the principal earthquake. Everywhere far less powerful, it\r\nwas yet strong enough to shake down many buildings at Polla that had\r\nbeen shattered by the great shock. Towards the south at Moliterno,\r\nand towards the north at Oliveto and Barielle, it evidently attracted\r\nvery little attention. So far as can be judged from the evidence given\r\nby Mallet, the disturbed area seems to have been approximately of the\r\nsame form and dimensions as the meizoseismal area, and elongated in\r\nthe same direction, but concentric with the north-west focus.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we may rely on too brief evidence, several\r\nafter-shocks recorded only at Montemurro, Saponara, Viggiano, or\r\nLagonegro, were probably connected with the south-east or Montemurro\r\nfocus.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nMallet's theories have suffered perhaps more than any other part of\r\nhis work from the recent growth of our knowledge. From a historical\r\npoint of view, some reference to his explanation of the origin of the\r\nNeapolitan earthquake seems desirable, and his own conscientious work\r\ndemands it. On the other hand, his conclusions are, for the present at\r\nany rate, superseded, and it will therefore be sufficient to describe\r\nthem briefly.\r\n\r\nMost of the wave-paths, as we have seen, pass within three miles of a\r\npoint almost coincident with the village of Caggiano. Of the\r\nremainder, six traverse a spot about two miles farther to the\r\nsouth-west, and three cross another about two miles farther to the\r\nnorth-east. Neglecting other points of intersection, but taking\r\naccount of the observed emergences at Vietri di Potenza, Auletta,\r\nPolla, etc., Mallet infers that the horizontal section of the focus\r\nwas a curve (indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 9) not less than ten\r\nmiles in length, and passing from near Balvano on the north, close to\r\nVietri di Potenza, Caggiano, and Pertosa, to a point about two and a\r\nhalf miles west of Polla. Again, he remarks, the observed emergences\r\nat places near the epicentre indicate that the vertical section of the\r\nseismic focus was either more or less curved, or more probably a\r\nsurface inclined towards the south-east. He concludes, therefore, that\r\nthe seismic focus was a curved fissure, 10 miles long and 3-1/2 miles\r\nin height, and with its centre at a depth of 6-1/2 miles below the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe production of this great fissure, accompanied, perhaps by the\r\ninjection into it of steam at high pressure, was regarded by Mallet as\r\nthe cause of the principal earthquake. He imagines that the rent would\r\nstart at or near the central point of the focus and then extend\r\nrapidly outwards in all directions. In the initial stage, vibrations\r\nof very small amplitude would alone be transmitted, and these would\r\ngive rise to the early sounds and tremors. As the rending proceeded,\r\nthe vibrations would increase in strength up to a certain point when\r\nthey produced the shock itself. After this, they would decrease; and,\r\nin the final stage, would give place to the small vibrations\r\ncorresponding to the sounds and tremors that marked the close of the\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nThe rush of steam at high pressure into the focus Mallet does not seem\r\nto have considered essential, though he evidently regarded it as\r\npossible, indeed probable; and he suggests that it may have been in\r\npart the cause of the earthquake which occurred an hour later. Though\r\nfeeling sceptical as to the existence of any general law of increase\r\nof underground temperature, he assumes it, for the sake of\r\nillustration, to be 1° F. for every 60 feet of descent. This would\r\ngive a temperature of 339° F. at the upper limit of the focus, 643° F.\r\nat its central point, and 884° F. at its lower margin. If the focus\r\nwere filled with steam at each of these temperatures, the\r\ncorresponding pressures on its walls would be 8, 149, and 684\r\natmospheres, respectively. As the steam may be supposed to be admitted\r\nsuddenly and to be unlimited in supply, Mallet infers that it might\r\nexist at the tension due to the highest of these temperatures, in\r\nwhich case it would be capable of lifting a column of limestone 8,550\r\nfeet in height (or about one-half the depth of the upper margin of the\r\nfocus), and would exert a pressure on the walls of the focus of 4.58\r\ntons per square inch, or of more than 640,528 millions of tons upon\r\nits whole surface.\r\n\r\nSo many pages have already been given to this interesting earthquake\r\nthat I must sketch still more briefly my own view as to its origin.\r\nThere were, I believe, two distinct foci with their centres about\r\ntwenty-four miles apart along a north-west and south-east line, and it\r\nwas to this arrangement that the elongation of the meizoseismal area\r\nwas chiefly, though not entirely, due. The evidence is insufficient to\r\ndetermine whether the earthquake was caused by fault-slipping; it is\r\nin no way opposed to this view, but if the Neapolitan earthquake stood\r\nalone, we should hardly be justified in drawing any further inference.\r\nRelying, however, on knowledge obtained from the study of more recent\r\nshocks, it seems to me probable that the two foci formed parts of one\r\nfault with a general north-west and south-east direction. The slip\r\ncausing the first part of the double shock apparently took place\r\nwithin the south-east focus, and was followed after a few seconds by\r\none within the north-west focus, greater in amount as well as more\r\ndeeply seated. In consequence of these displacements there were local\r\nincreases of stress, causing numerous small slips within or near both\r\nprincipal foci; and, if we may judge from some slight shocks felt at\r\nLa Sala, accompanied also by other minor slips in the intermediate\r\nregion of the fault.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE.\r\n\r\n  MALLET, R.--_The Great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857: The First\r\n        Principles of Observational Seismology_, etc. 2 vols 1862.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] _Irish Acad.

Ischia, the larger of the two islands, is six miles long from\r\neast to west, and five miles from north to south, and contains an area\r\nof twenty-six square miles. In 1881, the total population was 22,170,\r\nthat of Casamicciola, the largest town, being 3,963.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC HISTORY OF ISCHIA.\r\n\r\nThe central feature of Ischia is the great crater of Epomeo (_a_, Fig.\r\n14). On the south side, and partly also on the east, the crater-wall\r\nhas been broken down and removed; the portion remaining is about 1-1/2\r\nmile in diameter from east to west, and reaches a height of 2,600 feet\r\nabove the sea-level. All the upper part of the mountain is composed of\r\na pumiceous tufa, rich in sanidine and of a characteristic greenish\r\ncolour. At two points, to the west near Forio and to the north between\r\nLacco and Casamicciola, this tufa is seen reaching down to the sea;\r\nbut, in all other parts, it is covered by streams of trachitic lava,\r\nby more recent tufas, or by a deposit of marly appearance, which is\r\nregarded by Fuchs as resulting from the decomposition of the Epomean\r\ntufa.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct periods in the geological history of Ischia.\r\nThe first, a submarine period, probably began with the dawn of the\r\nquaternary epoch, for all the marine fossils of the island belong to\r\nexisting species. About this time, Epomeo seems to have originated in\r\neruptions occurring in a sea at least 1,700 feet in depth--eruptions\r\nthat preceded the formation of Monte Somma and were either\r\ncontemporaneous or alternating with those that gave rise to the oldest\r\ntrachitic tufas of the Phlegræan Fields. The destruction of the south\r\nwall may have occurred much later through some great eruptive\r\nparoxysm, but more probably, as Professor Mercalli suggests, through\r\nearly marine erosion and subsequent subaerial denudation. To the\r\nsubmarine period must also be assigned the formation of the trachitic\r\nmasses which compose Monti Trippiti, Vetta, and Garofoli (_b_, _c_,\r\n_d_, Fig. 14), on the east side of Epomeo; and, in part only, those of\r\nMonte Campagnano and Monte Vezza (_f_, _g_).\r\n\r\nAt or near the close of the elevation, many violent eruptions occurred\r\non the south-west of Epomeo, during which was formed the south-west\r\ncorner of the island, including Monte Imperatore and Capo Sant' Angelo\r\n(_h_, _i_).\r\n\r\nIn the second or terrestrial period, when the island had practically\r\nattained its present altitude, the eruptive activity was almost\r\nconfined to the eastern and northern flanks of Epomeo. At the\r\nbeginning Monte Lo Toppo (_j_) was formed by a lateral eruption. In\r\nthe north-west corner of the island, Monte Marecocco and Monte Zale\r\n(_k_ and _l_) owe their origin to a gigantic flow of sanidinic\r\ntrachite, issuing probably from the depression which now exists\r\nbetween them. Lastly, towards the north-east, are the recent lateral\r\ncraters of Rotaro, Montagnone, Bagno, and Cremate (_m_, _n_, _p_,\r\n_s_), the first two being the most regular and best preserved in the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Geological sketch-map of Ischia.\r\n   (_Mercalli._)[21]]\r\n\r\nThe earliest eruption of the historic, or rather human, period appears\r\nto have taken place from Montagnone, and probably also at about the\r\nsame time from the secondary crater of Porto d'Ischia (_u_), about the\r\nbeginning of the eleventh century B.C. The eruptions of Marecocco and\r\nZale are referred to about B.C. 470; and those of Rotaro and Tabor\r\n(_q_) to between the years 400 and 352 B.C. Another eruption is said\r\nto have occurred in B.C. 89, but the site of it is unknown; and three\r\nothers are recorded on doubtful authority about the years A.D. 79-81,\r\n138-161, and 284-305. The last outburst of all took place after the\r\nseries of earthquakes in 1302 from a new crater, that of Cremate\r\n(_s_), which opened on the north-east flank of Epomeo, and from which\r\na stream of lava, called the Arso (_t_), flowed down rapidly and,\r\nafter a course of two miles, reached the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter the first eruptions to which it owed its origin, the central\r\ncrater of Epomeo apparently remained inactive. All the later eruptions\r\noccurred either on the external flanks of the mountain or on radial\r\nfractures of the cone.[22] Trippiti, Lo Toppo, Montagnone and the Lago\r\ndel Bagno (_b_, _j_, _n_, _p_) lie in one line, Vetta and Cremate\r\n(_c_, _s_) on another, and Garofoli and Vatoliere (_d_, _e_) on a\r\nthird, all passing through a point near the town of Fontana, which\r\noccupies the centre of the old crater of Epomeo.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mercalli points out that the lateral eruptions of Epomeo\r\ndiffer in one respect from those of Etna and Vesuvius. In these\r\nvolcanoes the lava ascends to a considerable height in the central\r\nchimney, and by its own weight rends open the flanks of the cone. In\r\nEpomeo, it appears to traverse lateral passages at some depth, perhaps\r\nfar below the level of the sea, and to rend the mountain by means of\r\nthe elastic force of the aqueous vapour, etc., which it contains. It\r\nwill be seen how important is the bearing of this difference on the\r\noccurrence of the Ischian earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions that have taken place during the last three thousand\r\nyears agree in several particulars. They either occurred suddenly, or,\r\nat any rate, were not preceded by a stage of moderate Strombolian\r\nactivity; they were always accompanied by violent earthquakes; and all\r\nsucceeded intervals of long repose. As the eruption of 1302 happened\r\nafter at least a thousand years of rest, the lapse of six more\r\ncenturies does not justify us in concluding that Epomeo is at last\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nWe seem, on the contrary, to be drawing near another epoch of\r\nactivity. During the four and a half centuries that followed the\r\neruption of 1302, we have no record of Ischian earthquakes.[23] Then,\r\nsuddenly, on the night of July 28-29, 1762, Casamicciola was visited\r\nby sixty-two shocks, some of which were very strong and damaged\r\nbuildings. On March 18th, 1796, another severe shock took place, but\r\ndestructive only in the neighbourhood of Casamicciola, where seven\r\npersons were killed. On February 2nd, 1828, the area of damage, though\r\nconcentric with the former, enlarged its boundaries; 30 persons were\r\nkilled and 50 wounded. On March 6th, 1841, and during the night of\r\nAugust 15-16, 1867, further shocks injured houses at Casamicciola, but\r\nwithout causing any loss of life. Slight tremors occurred at various\r\ndates in 1874, 1875, 1879, and 1880, leading up to the disastrous\r\nearthquakes here described, those of March 4th, 1881, when 127 persons\r\nwere killed, and July 28th, 1883, which resulted in the death of 2,313\r\npersons and the wounding of many others.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKE OF MARCH 4TH, 1881.\r\n\r\nThe Ischian earthquakes have been fortunate in their investigators. In\r\nthe spring of 1881, Dr. H.J. Johnston-Lavis, the chronicler for many\r\nyears of Vesuvian phenomena, was residing in Naples. Impressed by a\r\nrecent perusal of Mallet's report on the Neapolitan earthquake, and\r\nwishing to test the value of the methods explained in the last\r\nchapter, he crossed over to Ischia on March 5th; and to his unwearied\r\ninquiries extending over more than three weeks and lasting from\r\nthirteen to sixteen hours a day, we are indebted for most of what we\r\nknow about the earthquake of 1881.\r\n\r\nOn March 4th, at 1.5 P.M., the great shock occurred abruptly, without\r\nany warning tremors. Its effects were aggravated by the faulty\r\nconstruction of the houses. The walls are of great thickness, loosely\r\nput together, and connected by mortar of the poorest quality. The\r\nchimneys and roofs also are massive, and the rafters are so slightly\r\ninserted in the walls that they were drawn out with the rocking of the\r\nhouses. In such cases, the destruction was often so complete that no\r\nfissures were left available for measurement.\r\n\r\n\r\nISOSEISMAL LINES AND DISTURBED AREA.\r\n\r\nThe isoseismal lines as drawn by Dr. Johnston-Lavis are represented by\r\nthe curves in Fig. 15. The isoseismal marked 1 bounds the area of\r\ncomplete destruction; it is about 1 mile long from east to west, 2/3\r\nof a mile broad, and contains an area of not more than half a square\r\nmile. The next isoseismal (2) marks the area of partial, but still\r\nserious, destruction; this is nearly 2 miles long from east to west,\r\n1-1/4 miles broad, and 2 square miles in area. Within the isoseismal\r\n3, buildings were more or less slightly damaged. The course of this\r\ncurve is somewhat doubtful, but, as drawn, it is about 3 miles long,\r\n2 miles wide, and 5 square miles in area.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Isoseismal lines of the Ischian\r\n   earthquake of 1881. (_Johnston-Lavis._)]\r\n\r\nOutside the last curve, the shock diminished rapidly in intensity. At\r\nMonte Tabor and Bagno, it was very slight; in the town of Ischia, only\r\nabout half the people were conscious of any movement; and at Capella,\r\na small village to the south, it was not felt at all. Again, the shock\r\nwas perceptible, though only faintly, in the neighbourhood of\r\nCampagnano, at Serrara to the south of Epomeo, and at Panza near the\r\nsouth-west corner of the island. On the other hand, at Fontana, which\r\noccupies approximately the centre of the crater of Epomeo, there were\r\nevidences of a distinctly stronger shock. No house actually fell, and\r\nside walls were but little injured; but the roofs, which are of great\r\nweight, suffered considerable injury.\r\n\r\nIn the adjacent island of Procida, the shock was felt distinctly by\r\nmany people, and by some, though slightly, at Monte di Procida,\r\nMisenum, and Bacoli, on the coast of Italy. No record whatever was\r\ngiven by the seismographs in the university of Naples and the\r\nobservatory on Vesuvius. We have of course no means of estimating the\r\nexact size of the disturbed area, but in this respect, disastrous as\r\nthe earthquake was in the neighbourhood of Casamicciola, it was\r\nclearly inferior to all but the very weakest earthquakes felt in the\r\nBritish Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE EPICENTRE.\r\n\r\nIn determining the position of the epicentre, Mallet's method was\r\nclosely followed. Fissures in buildings were used for the most part,\r\nin two out of every three cases; and occasional measurements were\r\nmade from objects overthrown, projected, or shifted, and also from the\r\npersonal experiences of observers. The attempt to apply the method\r\nwas, however, fraught with difficulties. The heterogeneous structure\r\nof the island was no doubt responsible for many divergent azimuths;\r\nthe irregularity of the buildings both in form and material and their\r\nvariety of site furnished other sources of error; even the smallness\r\nof the area was a disadvantage in lessening the number of trustworthy\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nMeasurements were made at 55 places altogether, but in most cases they\r\nwere the results of isolated observations, not the means of several at\r\neach place. On this account, I have not reproduced in Fig. 15 the\r\nazimuths shown in Dr. Johnston-Lavis's map of the earthquake. A large\r\nnumber of them clearly converge towards an area lying to the west of\r\nCasamicciola; and, from their arrangement, Dr. Johnston-Lavis\r\nconcludes, though the evidence does not seem to me quite strong enough\r\nfor the purpose, that they emanated from a fracture running from a\r\nlittle west of north to a little east of south.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is, however, justified by other evidence. In the\r\ncentre of the injured district, Dr. Johnston-Lavis has traced a\r\nmeizoseismal band, in which the shock must have been nearly or quite\r\nvertical. \"The damage inflicted on buildings included within this band\r\nwas,\" he says, \"very characteristic of the nature of the shock; the\r\nwalls having received but slight injury, whilst almost every floor and\r\nceiling had been totally destroyed. In fact,\" he adds, \"many houses\r\nwould have required no other repairs than the replacing of the\r\ndivisions between the different storeys.\" The shaded central area in\r\nFig. 15 represents this band, passing in a nearly north and south\r\ndirection from a point midway between Campo and the upper part of\r\nLacco on the north, through the west part of Casamenella and Campo, to\r\na point near Frasso on the south; the length of the band being thus\r\nabout two-thirds of a mile.\r\n\r\nIf the central line of this band is produced towards the south, as\r\nindicated by the dotted line, it grazes the west side of Fontana,\r\nwhere, as we have seen, there was a second meizoseismal area, much\r\nsmaller than the other and surrounded by a district in which houses\r\nwere almost uninjured. That the shock in this town was vertical or\r\nnearly so, is shown by the nature of the damage (p. 52) and also by\r\nthe testimony of the inhabitants. I will give Dr. Johnston-Lavis's\r\nexplanation of this detached meizoseismal area when discussing the\r\norigin of the Ischian earthquakes; but the evidence seems to me to\r\nfavour either the existence of two distinct foci or, more probably\r\nperhaps, the extension of the fissure to the south with an increased\r\nimpulse beneath the centre of Epomeo.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF THE SEISMIC FOCUS.\r\n\r\nAt nine places, Dr. Johnston-Lavis was able to make measurements of\r\nthe angle of emergence, in every case from fissures in buildings, and\r\ntherefore liable to sources of error already referred to. On the other\r\nhand, owing to the small depth of the focus, there would probably be\r\nless general refraction of the wave-paths than in the Neapolitan\r\nearthquake. The depths indicated by these observations vary between\r\nabout 615 and 2,885 feet, a difference that is no greater than might\r\nbe expected, as the size of the focus was no doubt comparable with\r\nthat of the district in which observations were made. The mean depth\r\nDr. Johnston-Lavis finds to be about 1,700 feet, or a little less than\r\none-third of a mile.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nThe limited depth of the focus is also evident from the nature of the\r\nshock. It was only within the actual meizoseismal band that the shock\r\nwas subsultory or vertical throughout; at a short distance from the\r\nepicentre, the movement was both subsultory and undulatory; while near\r\nthe third isoseismal, and in most of the region outside, the movement\r\nwas entirely undulatory or lateral. An observer at Perrone (which lies\r\n1-2/3 miles east of the epicentre) gives the following account of the\r\nshock:--\"I was standing on my balcony (this faces Casamicciola)\r\nadmiring the scene ... when I felt the house rock, feeling at the same\r\ntime as if something was rolling along beneath the ground. This\r\nmovement was accompanied by a sound like this, Boob, boob -- boob --\r\n-- boob -- -- -- boob -- -- -- -- boob. Both noise and movement seemed to\r\ncome from Casamicciola.... In a few seconds, in the distance over the\r\ntown arose a terrific cloud of white dust, so that I imagined the town\r\non fire.... I felt hardly any, if any, subsultory movement, but as I\r\nleant upon the balcony rails, I was alternately pressed against them\r\nand then drawn away.\"\r\n\r\nAt Fontana, however, the undulatory shock was replaced by a vertical\r\none. This was the universal experience, though one or two persons felt\r\na slight lateral movement immediately after. At Valle (near Barano)\r\nand Piejo, both places about a mile from Fontana, the vertical\r\ncomponent was also perceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER-SHOCKS.\r\n\r\nThe after-shocks were few and of slight intensity. Dr. Johnston-Lavis\r\ngives the following dates: March 7th, 12.5 A.M. and midday; March\r\n11-12, 15-16, 17-18, 27 (?), April 5th and 6th, and July 18th, 8.30\r\nP.M. The only shock of the series marked as strong occurred at\r\nmidnight on March 15-16 at Casamicciola. The last of all, that of July\r\n18th, consisted of a rumble and slight shock, and was most perceptible\r\nat Fango.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKE OF JULY 28TH, 1883.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by the experience of 1881 or by the warnings of\r\nseismologists, Casamicciola was rebuilt, only to suffer more complete\r\ndisaster. On July 28th, 1883, at 9.25 P.M., occurred the most\r\ndestructive earthquake of which we have any record in Ischia. The\r\nshock lasted about fifteen seconds, and before it was over clouds of\r\ndust were rising above the ruins of Casamicciola, Lacco, and Forio;\r\n1,200 houses were destroyed, 2,313 persons were killed, nearly 1,800\r\nin Casamicciola alone, and more than 800 seriously wounded. \"No better\r\nidea,\" says Dr. Johnston-Lavis, \"of the absolute destruction of\r\nbuildings could be conceived than what was actually realised at\r\nCasamicciola and Campo. Looking, on the following Monday, over the\r\nfield of destruction, I could discover (with few exceptions) the\r\nwall-stumps only remaining.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Johnston-Lavis again spent about three weeks in the island,\r\nexamining the effects of the new shock with equal zeal and wider\r\nexperience. His monograph is now our chief work of reference on\r\nIschian earthquakes. Inquiries were also made by several Italian\r\nseismologists, among others by Professor M.S. de Rossi, the organiser\r\nof earthquake-studies in the peninsula; by Professor L. Palmieri, the\r\nfounder of the Vesuvian observatory; and especially by Professor G.\r\nMercalli, whose valuable memoir supplements the report of Dr.\r\nJohnston-Lavis in some important particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATORY SIGNS.\r\n\r\nThe interval between July 18th, 1881, when the last shock of that year\r\nwas felt, and July 28th, 1883, was one of almost complete quiescence.\r\nEarly in March 1882, a few slight shocks were noticed at Casamicciola.\r\nOn July 24th, 1883, a watch hanging from a nail in a wall was seen to\r\nswing at 6 A.M. and 9 A.M., and, on the same morning, at about 8.30, a\r\nslight shock, accompanied by a rumbling sound, was felt at\r\nCasamicciola. Again, on the 28th, about a quarter of an hour before\r\nthe great shock, one observer at Casamicciola states that an\r\nunderground noise was heard, and that some persons in consequence left\r\ntheir houses.\r\n\r\nMany assertions have been made with regard to variations witnessed a\r\nday or two before the shock in the hot springs, such as an increase of\r\nflow or temperature and changes in their volume and purity. Fumaroles\r\nare alleged to have burst out with violence, and even flames to have\r\nbeen seen. The statements, though widely quoted, can hardly be said\r\nto rest on satisfactory evidence. On the other hand, Dr.\r\nJohnston-Lavis arrived in the island within twenty-four hours after\r\nthe shock, and, before another day had elapsed, he had examined most\r\nof the places where the phenomena were said to have occurred, but\r\ncould find no remarkable change nor any signs of such having taken\r\nplace. It is also known, as he remarks, that the temperature of the\r\nIschian springs and fumaroles sometimes varies considerably without\r\nany earthquake following, that of the water of Gurgitello occasionally\r\nchanging by as much as 30° or 40°. We may therefore, I think, conclude\r\nthat, except for one or two shocks and underground noises too slight\r\nto cause general alarm, there were no decisive heralds of the great\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nISOSEISMAL LINES AND DISTURBED AREA.\r\n\r\nThe curves in Fig. 16 represent the isoseismal lines as drawn by Dr.\r\nJohnston-Lavis. As in the earthquake of 1881, they bound respectively\r\nthe areas of complete destruction, partial destruction and slight\r\ndamage to buildings, the course of the outer line being to a great\r\nextent conjectural owing to the small extent of land traversed by it.\r\nThe first isoseismal is about 2-1/2 miles long, 1-1/2 miles broad, and\r\n3 square miles in area; the second about 4 miles long, 3-1/2 miles\r\nbroad, and 11 square miles in area; and the third about 6-1/2 miles\r\nlong, 6 miles broad, and 30 square miles in area. The curve drawn by\r\nProfessor Mercalli (Fig. 14) coincides nearly with the second of these\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nAt Fontana, the damage exceeded that in the surrounding country,\r\nthough the difference was of course less marked than on the previous\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Isoseismal lines of the Ischian\r\n   earthquake of 1883.]\r\n\r\nOutside Ischia, the shock was felt distinctly in all the island of\r\nProcida and in Vivara; on the mainland, by some as far as Pozzuoli\r\nand by several persons in Naples, which is twenty miles from\r\nCasamicciola. The seismograph at the university of this city\r\nregistered two small shocks, the first at 9.10 P.M., and the second\r\nand stronger at 9.25 P.M.; and De Rossi states that at about 9.30 P.M.\r\nthe seismographs at Ceccano, Velletri, and Rome recorded a shock\r\nconsisting of very slow undulations. There are again no materials for\r\nestimating the size of the disturbed area, but there can be no doubt\r\nthat it was much less than that of a moderately strong British\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE EPICENTRE.\r\n\r\nOwing to the limited size of the disturbed area, time-observations,\r\neven had they been available, would not have sufficed to determine the\r\nposition of the epicentre, and both Dr. Johnston-Lavis and Professor\r\nMercalli therefore had recourse to Mallet's method, the former relying\r\nchiefly, as before, on fissures in damaged buildings, and the latter\r\non the overthrow or displacement of columns and other objects.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnston-Lavis measured the azimuth of the wave-paths at\r\nsixty-five places, and at about one-third of these was able to make\r\ntwo or more observations. The azimuths converge towards the same\r\nregion as in 1881, but the area covered by their intersections is\r\nlarger. The meizoseismal band of maximum vertical destruction\r\nindicated by shading in Fig. 16 is also of the same form and slightly\r\ngreater extent, reaching from the upper part of Lacco to a little\r\nsouth of Frasso, and being therefore nearly a mile in length. The\r\ncentre of maximum impulse was in the same position as in 1881, or\r\npossibly a little more to the south.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mercalli's observations were made at forty-eight places, and\r\nin only six cases were they the same as those used by his predecessor.\r\nHe also notices that most of the azimuths converge towards\r\nCasamenella, and intersect within an elongated area. This area runs in\r\nthe same direction as Dr. Johnston-Lavis's meizoseismal band, but is\r\nless elongated, and situated a short distance farther to the south,\r\nthough on the whole the agreement between the two areas is remarkably\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThere was again apparently a second epicentre at Fontana. In this\r\ntown, according to Dr. Johnston-Lavis, there were two distinct types\r\nof damage. As in 1881, there was evidence of a vertical blow, the only\r\none that absolutely ruined houses; but, in addition, there was another\r\nindependent set of fissures, quite as widely distributed as the\r\nothers, though evidently caused by a less violent movement. These\r\nindicated a wave-path with a low angle of emergence coming from\r\nbetween north and north-north-west, or almost exactly in the line of\r\nmeizoseismal band. To the south of Fontana, however, there is a group\r\nof places, including Panza, Serrara, Barano, etc., where the azimuths\r\ndiverged rather widely from the epicentre at Casamenella. These\r\nazimuths are twelve in number, and it is worthy of notice that they\r\nall intersected the crater of Epomeo, while half of them passed within\r\na few hundred yards of Fontana.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF THE SEISMIC FOCUS.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the angle of emergence were made by Dr. Johnston-Lavis\r\nat twenty-four places, and in every case from fissured walls. The\r\ngreater part of the diagram on which his results are depicted is\r\nreproduced in Fig. 17. The horizontal line, as in Fig. 13, represents\r\nthe level of the sea, the longer vertical line one passing through the\r\nepicentre, and the shorter another through Fontana. The short lines\r\non the left of the former show the incipient wave-paths to places\r\nlying east of the epicentre; those on the right, with one exception,\r\nrepresent the wave-paths to places west of the same meridian. Small\r\nhorizontal marks are inserted on the vertical lines to show the depth\r\nin tenths of a mile below the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Diagram of wave-paths at seismic\r\n   vertical of Ischian earthquake of 1883. (_Johnston-Lavis._)]\r\n\r\nThe six angles of emergence that would give the greatest depth below\r\nthe epicentre were all measured at places in the south of the island\r\nclose to the line joining Panza and Barano, and it will be noticed\r\nthat five of these apparent depths are much greater than those\r\nobtained from the other wave-paths. Excluding these observations, the\r\nremaining eighteen give depths ranging from about 450 to about 3,350\r\nfeet, and a mean depth of 1,730 feet,[24] or nearly one-third of a\r\nmile, that is, almost exactly the same as the mean depth found from\r\nthe earthquake of 1881.\r\n\r\nThe six exceptional angles of emergence come from the district of\r\ndivergent azimuths to the south of Epomeo. Three of the corresponding\r\nazimuths pass within one-quarter of a mile from the centre of Fontana,\r\nand none of the other three more than three-quarters of a mile from\r\nthe same point. Though disbelieving in a subsidiary focus below this\r\ntown, Dr. Johnston-Lavis has calculated its mean depth, supposing it\r\nto exist, and found it to be about 1,560 feet below the sea level, a\r\nresult which is remarkably close to the calculated mean depth of the\r\nfocus near Casamenella.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nIn the meizoseismal band, preliminary tremor and rumbling sound were\r\nalike absent. So sudden, indeed, was the onset of the earthquake, that\r\nthe survivors generally found themselves beneath the ruins of their\r\nhouses before they were conscious of any shock. The destruction,\r\npractically instantaneous, was wrought by four or five vertical blows,\r\nso powerful that, according to some observers, Casamicciola seemed to\r\njump into the air. Then followed undulations, not noticed by all, that\r\nappeared to come from every direction. The shock lasted altogether\r\nfifteen seconds or more,[25] and was accompanied by a rumbling noise,\r\nin the midst of which were detonations as of thunder or of great blows\r\ngiven upon an empty barrel.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of the meizoseismal area, at Perrone,\r\nPennella, and Lower Lacco, the subsultory movement was still the more\r\nprominent; but, farther away, as at Panza, Testacchio, Barano, Ischia,\r\nand Bagno, the subsultory motion was followed by distinctly horizontal\r\nundulations, while outside the island of Ischia only slow undulatory\r\nmovements were perceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDSLIPS.\r\n\r\nThe dotted areas in Fig. 16 indicate the sites of the only landslips\r\nof importance that were precipitated by the earthquake of 1883. Two of\r\nthese occurred on the north slope of Epomeo, and the third on the\r\nwest flank of Monte Rotaro. The materials of the Epomean landslips had\r\nevidently been separated for some time by shallow fissures from the\r\nadjoining rock, for the surfaces of the fissures were discoloured by\r\nfumarolic action. Immediately after the earthquake a cloud of dust was\r\nseen to rise from the spots; the masses, already detached laterally,\r\nwere merely set in motion by the shock; and they continued to slide\r\ndown during the following days either through the action of the\r\nafter-shocks or of the heavy rains that followed.\r\n\r\nAll over the island, however, fissures and minor landslips occurred.\r\nAt two places on the north coast the steep cliffs of incoherent tufa\r\nwere so much damaged that, according to Dr. Johnston-Lavis, \"large\r\nquantities of their materials were thrown into the sea. The water then\r\nsorted out the pieces of pumice, which in many cases were of very\r\nlarge size, and were seen floating about in the neighbourhood for some\r\ndays,\" giving rise to the supposition that a submarine eruption had\r\ntaken place to the north of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER-SHOCKS.\r\n\r\nThe after-shocks in 1883 were much more numerous than in 1881. Between\r\n9.25 P.M. on July 28th and noon on August 3rd, twenty-one slight\r\nshocks were recorded at Casamicciola. At 2.15 P.M. on August 3rd, a\r\nviolent shock occurred that caused further damage at Forio, and even\r\nat places so far from the epicentre as Fiaiano, Barano, and Fontana,\r\nand increased the displacements of the landslips on Epomeo. This\r\nshock was also registered at the observatory on Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nAfter this the shocks became less frequent and slighter, twelve being\r\nfelt at Casamicciola during the remainder of the year, and six in the\r\nfirst half of 1884. Several shocks and rumbling noises were also\r\nobserved in other parts of the island. Among them may be mentioned\r\nnoises heard at Fontana on August 12th and 15th, and a slight shock at\r\nthe same place on August 17th; also on September 4th, at 10.30 and\r\n10.40 A.M., slight shocks at Barano, Serrara, and Forio. On March\r\n27th, 1884, at 2.7 P.M., another strong shock occurred; strongest at\r\nSerrara, where the shock was subsultory and accompanied by noise; and\r\nless strong, though still subsultory, at Ciglio, Panza, Forio,\r\nFiaiano, and Casamicciola, and very slight at Ischia. The series seems\r\nto have ended during the following summer, with a slight shock at\r\nCasamicciola on July 21st, and a stronger one on July 23rd, felt from\r\nCasamicciola on the north to Serrara on the south.\r\n\r\nMost of the after-shocks must have originated in the neighbourhood of\r\nCasamicciola, but it is worthy of notice that more than one centre was\r\nin action. Several were recorded at Ischia only. Others, as mentioned\r\nabove, affected chiefly the south part of the island, and especially\r\nthe small towns of Serrara and Fontana.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF ISCHIAN EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nAfter the eruption of 1302, there succeeded a period of comparative\r\nrepose in Ischia. The revival of activity dates from 1762, and, since\r\nthat year, there have been four great earthquakes, namely, those of\r\n1796, 1828, 1881, and 1883. In every respect but that of increasing\r\nintensity, these earthquakes were apparently identical; each, as\r\nProfessor Mercalli says, was merely a replica on a different scale of\r\nthose that preceded it. The principal features in which they resemble\r\none another, and differ from the average tectonic earthquake, are the\r\ncoincidence of the epicentres, the small depth of the foci, and the\r\nsudden onset of the principal shock.\r\n\r\n1. _Coincidence of Epicentres._--In Fig. 14, which is copied from\r\nProfessor Mercalli's map, are shown the areas in which buildings were\r\nseriously damaged by these four earthquakes. The curves for 1796,\r\n1828, and 1881 are approximately concentric. In 1796, the shock was\r\ndisastrous only to the west of Casamicciola; in 1828, according to\r\nCovelli, \"the ground most injured was not precisely the region of\r\nCasamicciola, but that which lies between the district called Fango\r\nand that known as Casamenella, situated to the west of Casamicciola,\r\nand a short distance from it.\"[26] The epicentres may have varied\r\nslightly in size, but, in position, it is clear that all four were\r\nnearly or quite coincident. The meizoseismal bands in 1881 and 1883\r\nwere also similar in form and elongated in the same direction.\r\n\r\nIn the last two earthquakes there was, as we have seen, very distinct\r\nevidence of a secondary meizoseismal area surrounding Fontana, and it\r\nis remarkable that this was also noticeable in the earthquake of 1828.\r\n\"Besides the centre of vibration in the district of Fango,\" says\r\nCovelli, \"another less powerful centre showed itself in the locality\r\nof Fontana; this made itself felt more heavily than in surrounding\r\nlocalities; as if another centre of movement had taken place from that\r\npart, independent of the former.\"\r\n\r\n2. _Small Depth of the Foci._--Mallet's method, as noted above, cannot\r\nbe trusted to yield accurate estimates of the focal depth, or to\r\nindicate more than its order of magnitude. But it is remarkable that\r\nthe depths calculated by Dr. Johnston-Lavis for the last two\r\nearthquakes are both only a little less than a third of a mile, and it\r\nis probable that the actual depth did not differ very greatly from\r\nthis amount. The nature of the shock, vertical or nearly so close to\r\nthe epicentre and horizontal at a short distance from it, is merely\r\npersonal testimony of the same character as fissures in masonry, and\r\nof course points to the same result.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Diagram showing connection between depth\r\n   of focus and rate of decline in intensity.]\r\n\r\nBut the most conclusive evidence on which we have to rely is the\r\nextraordinary intensity of the shock at the centre of a very small\r\ndistributed area. In Great Britain, an earthquake felt over a district\r\nof equal size would hardly at the centre exceed the trembling produced\r\nin a station platform by a passing train. The curves in Fig. 18 show\r\nhow the rate of decline in intensity depends on the depth of the\r\nfocus. They are drawn on the supposition that the intensity at any\r\npoint on the surface varies inversely as the square of its distance\r\nfrom the focus; the curves _a_, _b_, _c_ corresponding to foci\r\nsituated at depths of one-third of a mile, one mile, and two miles\r\nrespectively, and the figures below the horizontal line denoting the\r\ndistance in miles from the epicentre. Thus, the rapid decline of\r\nintensity from the epicentre outwards shows that, in each of the four\r\ngreat Ischian earthquakes, the depths of the focus must have been very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\n3. _Suddenness of the Shocks._--In 1796, we have no record of\r\npreparatory shocks, but the evidence is scanty; in 1828 and 1881, none\r\nare mentioned; in 1883, one or two tremors and underground noises,\r\npossibly of seismic origin, gave warning to a few. Fore-shocks, for\r\nall practical purposes, were conspicuous by their absence.\r\n\r\nStill more remarkable is the sudden advent of the great shocks. There\r\nwere no preliminary tremors or rumbling sound, no animals showed signs\r\nof uneasiness and no birds fluttered screaming from trees or ground.\r\nThe shock of 1828, says Covelli, \"was announced by three powerful\r\nblows coming almost vertically, from below upwards;\" and the same\r\nwords apply equally well to the earthquakes of 1881 and 1883. The\r\ndestruction of houses in every case was practically instantaneous, and\r\ncoincident with the first vibration.\r\n\r\nIn all respects, tectonic earthquakes differ widely from the Ischian\r\nshocks. The epicentres of successive earthquakes are rarely\r\ncoincident, but show a distinct tendency to migration along certain\r\nlines; the decline in intensity outwards from the epicentre is nearly\r\nalways very gradual, and therefore indicative of a comparatively\r\ndeep-seated focus; they are almost invariably preceded either by a\r\nseries of slight shocks and rumbling sounds, or, in an unstable\r\ndistrict, by a marked increase in their frequency. Distinctions, so\r\ngreat as these are, evidently remove the Ischian shocks from the\r\ncategory of tectonic earthquakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE ISCHIAN EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Ischian earthquakes possess several features\r\nwhich connect them closely with true volcanic earthquakes.\r\n\r\n1. They originate beneath the northern slope of Epomeo--a volcano that\r\nwe have no reason to consider absolutely extinct, but rather as one\r\nsubject to eruptions at long intervals of time--in a region as yet\r\nunoccupied by parasitic craters, but having the same relation to the\r\ncentral cone of Epomeo as those in which the recent craters of Monte\r\nRotaro, Montagnone and Cremate are situated.\r\n\r\n2. In both the earthquakes of 1881 and 1883, the epicentre is an\r\nelongated band, the axis of which, if produced, would pass through the\r\ncentre of the old crater of Epomeo. Along the line of this band, occur\r\nthe fumaroles of Monte Cito and Ignazio Verde and the thermal springs\r\nof the Rita and Capitello. These facts, as Professor Mercalli\r\nsuggests, lead us to believe that the foci of the earthquakes coincide\r\nwith a radial fracture of the volcano, the course of which, as traced\r\nby him, is represented by the continuous line in Fig. 14.[27]\r\n\r\n3. Except in their relations with actual eruptions, the Ischian\r\nearthquakes resemble closely the true volcanic earthquakes which from\r\ntime to time shake the flanks of Etna. These are marked by great\r\nintensity of the shock at the centre of a comparatively small\r\ndisturbed area, epicentres often elongated radially to the cone,\r\nfrequent repetition with similar characters in the same districts; and\r\nas a rule they precede by a short interval, but sometimes accompany or\r\nfollow, volcanic eruptions.[28]\r\n\r\nTwo other phenomena may be referred to as probably indicating some\r\nconnection between Ischian earthquakes and the structure and history\r\nof Epomeo.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, in the three earthquakes of 1828, 1881, and 1883,\r\nthere is distinct evidence of a second meizoseismal area at Fontana,\r\nwithin which the shock was mainly subsultory. Dr. Johnston-Lavis,\r\nthough recognising the possibility of the existence of two epicentres,\r\nprefers another explanation.[29] But the wide extension of the\r\nsouthern boundary of the area of destruction in 1883, and the\r\nlimitation of several of the after-shocks to the south of the island,\r\nseem to me to favour the existence of a second focus beneath the\r\ncrater of Epomeo, though, it may be, not entirely detached from the\r\nchief focus beneath Casamenella.\r\n\r\nAgain, as Professor Mercalli remarks, all historic eruptions on the\r\nflanks of Epomeo were accompanied by very violent earthquakes; while,\r\npreviously to 1302, only one disastrous earthquake, so far as known,\r\noccurred in the island without being attended by an eruption. It\r\nshould be noticed also that the principal shocks during the recent\r\nrevival of activity (_i.e._, since 1762) show a continual increase in\r\nintensity, whether this be measured by the damage to buildings, the\r\nloss of life, or the extent of the area of destruction (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\nIt therefore seems legitimate to conclude that, in the recent Ischian\r\nearthquakes, we have merely so many unsuccessful attempts to force a\r\nnew volcanic eruption. The passages once existing through Epomeo and\r\nits parasitic craters having become blocked, the highly heated magma\r\nbeneath is compelled to find a new outlet. Its tension slowly\r\nincreasing, the crust above is at last rent, or an incipient rent is\r\nenlarged, the fluid rock is injected almost instantaneously with great\r\nforce into the open fissure, and its sudden arrest by the containing\r\nwalls is the ultimate cause of an earthquake. With the expansion of\r\nthe magma, its tension is at once correspondingly reduced, and some\r\ntime must elapse before it can again reach the critical point at which\r\na further rupture, resulting in a second shock, takes place.[30]\r\n\r\nThus, with each great Ischian earthquake, we are, I believe, advancing\r\na step nearer the time, which may be close at hand or may be very\r\nremote, when the fracture will at last reach the surface, and above\r\nthe site of Casamenella a new parasitic cone will rise, from which, as\r\nfrom Cremate in 1302, a stream of lava may flow down towards the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.\r\n\r\n  1.

Dr. Johnston-Lavis, on the other hand,\r\nconsiders the general estimate of fifteen seconds as far too low. In\r\none case, at Casamicciola, he ranks it as high as thirty-one seconds.\r\n\r\n[26] Quoted from the useful translation of Covelli's memoir given by\r\nDr. Johnston-Lavis.\r\n\r\n[27] Baldacci supposes that the thermal springs and fumaroles of\r\nForio, Stennecchia, Montecito, Casamicciola, and Castiglione lie along\r\na tangential fracture starting from Forio and passing by Casamicciola\r\nto near Punta di Castiglione. Mercalli, however, argues forcibly\r\nagainst this inference.\r\n\r\n[28] Professor Mercalli adds, as a fourth point of contact between\r\nIschian earthquakes and volcanic phenomena, the changes in the\r\nfumaroles and hot springs which preceded or accompanied or followed\r\nthe earthquakes of 1828, 1881, and 1883.\r\n\r\n[29] \"Fontana,\" he says, \"occupies the centre of the great crater of\r\nEpomeo..., and therefore lies immediately over the ancient chimney,\r\nwhich in all probability is filled by an old plug of consolidated\r\ntrachyte, which must descend to the igneous reservoir. Any mass of\r\nigneous matter, that might determine the further rupture of a\r\ncollateral fissure, would result in the conduction of any changes of\r\npressure or vibrations, along the column of highly elastic trachyte;\r\nwhilst the same earth-waves would be annulled or absorbed by the\r\ninelastic tufas surrounding it, so that the blow would be struck\r\nperpendicularly to the surface, and in a small area with well defined\r\nlimits. The undulatory sensations, after the principal local shock,\r\nwere those that arrived from the great centre of impulse beneath\r\nCasamenella.\"\r\n\r\n[30] The above paragraph is a summary of the reasoning stated with\r\nadmirable clearness by Dr. Johnston-Lavis. It should be mentioned that\r\nthe late Professor Palmieri, relying on the extremely limited\r\ndisturbed area, dissented from this view; but his difficulty is met by\r\nsupposing the focus to be small as well as shallow, a supposition that\r\nis supported by the shortness of the meizoseismal band, as well as by\r\nthe elongation of the isoseismal lines in the direction perpendicular\r\nto this band.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE ANDALUSIAN EARTHQUAKE OF DECEMBER 25TH, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn most countries the principal seismic districts are of limited\r\nextent. Thus, in central Japan, the east coast is frequently visited\r\nby earthquakes, while the west coast is relatively undisturbed. Of the\r\nearthquakes felt in the kingdom of Greece during the years 1893-98, 63\r\nper cent. were observed in Zante, and were for the most part confined\r\nto that island. In the interior of the Iberian peninsula--in Leon and\r\nin New and Old Castile--destructive earthquakes are practically\r\nunknown; while the littoral regions of central and southern Portugal,\r\nAndalusia, and Catalonia are noted for their disastrous shocks.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century seismic activity was chiefly\r\nconcentrated in Portugal, and culminated in the great Lisbon\r\nearthquake of 1755. In the following century the seat of disturbance\r\nwas transferred from the west to the south of the peninsula; Portugal\r\nremained throughout in comparative repose, while Almeria experienced\r\ndestructive shocks in 1804, 1860, and 1863, and Murcia in 1828-29 and\r\n1864, leading up to the Andalusian earthquakes of 1884-85, described\r\nin the present chapter.\r\n\r\nThe preparation for the principal earthquake of December 25th, 1884,\r\nwas unusually indistinct. For a day or two before, shocks were felt\r\nhere and there in Andalusia, but so weak were they that they passed\r\nalmost unperceived. During the night of December 24-25, one slight\r\nshock was noticed at Colmeñar (Fig. 19) and another at Zafarraya. On\r\nthe 25th, a faint movement of the ground was noticed at Malaga, and a\r\nfew weak tremors at Periana; and shortly after came the great shock at\r\nabout 8.50 P.M. mean time of Malaga, or about 9.8 P.M. Greenwich mean\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThis earthquake was investigated by no fewer than three official\r\ncommittees. The first in the field was nominated by the Spanish\r\nGovernment on January 7th, 1885, and consisted of four members, the\r\nPresident being Señor M.F. de Castro, the director of the Geological\r\nSurvey of Spain. The report of this commission was presented to the\r\nMinister of Agriculture, etc., on March 12th. Early in February a\r\nFrench Commission, appointed by the Academy of Sciences, proceeded to\r\nthe scene of the disaster. With Professor F. Fouqué as chief, and MM.\r\nLévy, Bertrand, Barrois, Offret, Kilian, Bergeron, and Bréon as\r\nmembers, this committee resolved itself after a time into one for\r\nstudying the geology of the central area; and, of their voluminous\r\nreport of more than 700 quarto pages (published in 1889), only 55 are\r\nimmediately concerned with the earthquake. At the beginning of April,\r\nProfessors Taramelli and Mercalli, sent by the Italian Government,\r\narrived in Andalusia; and their memoir, read a few months later before\r\nthe Reale Accademia dei Lincei, forms by far the most valuable\r\ncontribution to our knowledge of the earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMAGE CAUSED BY THE EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nThe meizoseismal area (see Figs. 19 and 20) lies in a mountainous\r\ndistrict, almost equidistant from the cities of Malaga and Granada. In\r\nthis area, which contains nearly 900 square miles, the shock was\r\ndisastrous to all but well-built houses. Whole villages were\r\noverthrown. In the surrounding zone many buildings escaped serious\r\ndamage, and only a few were completely destroyed. It is estimated by\r\nthe Spanish Commission that, in the province of Granada, 3,342 houses\r\nwere totally, and 2,138 partially, ruined; in the province of Malaga,\r\n1,057 houses were totally, and 4,178 partially, ruined; while in the\r\ntwo provinces together 6,463 houses were damaged; making a total of\r\n17,178 buildings more or less seriously injured.\r\n\r\nAs usual in the South of Europe, bad construction and narrow streets\r\nwere largely responsible for the loss of property, houses that were\r\nregularly built and made of good materials being only slightly\r\ninjured. But, in this case, the great slope of the ground, the bad\r\nquality of the foundations, and the nature of the underlying rocks\r\nwere contributing factors. Many buildings also had been damaged by\r\nprevious shocks, and their ruin was only completed by the earthquake\r\nof 1884.\r\n\r\nThe total loss of life is variously estimated. According to the\r\nSpanish Commission, 690 persons were killed and 1,426 wounded in the\r\nprovince of Granada, while 55 were killed and 59 wounded in that of\r\nMalaga, making a total of 745 persons killed and 1,485 wounded. The\r\nItalian seismologists, having additional materials at their disposal,\r\nraise the total figures to 750 persons killed and 1,554 severely\r\nwounded. Careful inquiries were also made on this subject by the\r\nconductors of the newspaper _El Defensor de Granada_. In Granada\r\nalone, they reckon that 828 persons were killed and 1,164 wounded.\r\n\r\nFrom the table given in the Italian report, it appears that 330\r\npersons were killed at Alhama, 118 at Arenas del Rey, 102 at\r\nAlbuñuelas, 77 at Ventas de Zafarraya, and 40 at Periana; the\r\npercentage of mortality being 9 at Arenas del Rey, about the same at\r\nVentas de Zafarraya, and 3 or 4 at Alhama, Albuñuelas and Periana.\r\nComparing these latter figures with the death rates of 71 per cent. at\r\nMontemurro, caused by the Neapolitan earthquake, and of about 45 per\r\ncent. at Casamicciola, by the Ischian earthquake of 1883, it will be\r\nseen that the loss of life during the Andalusian earthquake was\r\ncomparatively small--an exemption which is attributed by the Italian\r\ncommissioners to the absence of inhabited places from the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the epicentre, and to the fact that the destructive\r\nvibrations occurred towards the end of the shock, thus allowing\r\nopportunity for escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nISOSEISMAL LINES AND DISTURBED AREA.\r\n\r\nFig. 19 shows the principal isoseismal lines as drawn by the Italian\r\ncommissioners. The meizoseismal area, which included all places at\r\nwhich the shock was disastrous, is bounded by an ellipse (marked 1 on\r\nthe map) 40 miles long from east to west, 28 miles wide, and about 886\r\nsquare miles in area. The next isoseismal (2) includes the places in\r\nwhich some buildings were ruined, but not as a rule completely, and in\r\nwhich there was no loss of life. Its bounding line is also elliptical,\r\nthe longer axis being about 71 miles long and running nearly east and\r\nwest. Towards the south this zone is interrupted by the sea. It will\r\nbe noticed that these isoseismals are not concentric, the second\r\nextending much farther to the west and south-west than in the\r\nopposite direction. A third isoseismal (not shown in the map) encloses\r\nthe district in which the shock was \"very strong,\" or just capable of\r\nproducing cracks in the walls of houses. It is similar in form to the\r\nsecond isoseismal, reaching as far as Estepone to the south-west,\r\nOsuna, Cordova, and Seville to the west, Jaen to the north, while\r\ntowards the east it stops short of Almeria.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Isoseismal lines of Andalusian\r\n   earthquake. (_Taramelli and Mercalli._)]\r\n\r\nThe French Commission have also published a map of the earthquake,\r\nand, though the work of an experienced seismologist like Professor\r\nMercalli is probably more trustworthy, it is interesting to compare\r\nhis isoseismal lines with those obtained by his French colleagues,\r\nwhich are reproduced in Fig. 20. The curves in this figure are drawn\r\nso as to include the places that were, respectively, ruined, seriously\r\ndamaged, and slightly damaged, by the shock. They should therefore\r\ncorrespond with the lines in Fig. 19. It will be seen that they differ\r\nconsiderably in form, but at the same time they present certain points\r\nof agreement, such as the east and west elongation of the meizoseismal\r\narea, and the great extension of the two outer isoseismals towards the\r\nwest and south-west The greatest difference is to be found in the\r\neastern portion of the third isoseismal, which, according to the\r\nItalians, extends beyond the limits included in Fig. 20, and,\r\naccording to the French, is bayed back by the great masses of the\r\nSierra Nevada.\r\n\r\nOutside Andalusia the earthquake was sensibly felt to the north as far\r\nas Madrid and Segovia, to the west at Huelva, Cárceres and Lisbon, and\r\nto the east at Valencia and Murcia. Towards the south, the greater\r\npart of the disturbed area was cut off by the Mediterranean, and there\r\nare no records forthcoming from the opposite coast of Africa. The\r\ntotal area disturbed by the earthquake is roughly estimated by the\r\nFrench Commission at about 154,000 square miles, and by the Italian\r\nCommission at about 174,000 square miles; but, as the shock was\r\nstrong enough to stop clocks and ring bells at Madrid, it is evident\r\nthat even the greater of these values is too small.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Isoseismal lines of Andalusian\r\n   earthquake. (_Fouqué, etc._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNFELT EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nFar beyond the limits of the disturbed area, however, the long slow\r\nwaves sped over the surface, disturbing magnetographs and other\r\ndelicate instruments. More than a century before, the great Lisbon\r\nearthquake of 1755 had caused oscillations in Scottish lakes, and on\r\nother occasions the effects of remote earthquakes had been witnessed\r\nat isolated places. But, in 1884, the concurrent registration of the\r\nAndalusian earth-waves at distant observatories attracted general\r\nattention, and in part suggested the world-wide network of\r\nseismological stations, the foundation of which was laid before\r\nanother decade had passed.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, probable records of the earthquake were obtained at two\r\nobservatories, but, owing to the approximate times given, their\r\nconnection with it is not established. At Velletri, near Rome,\r\nProfessor Galli's seismodynamograph registered a very slight movement\r\nat 10 P.M., and at Rome itself Professor de Rossi found a tromometer\r\nmaking unusual oscillations at 10.15 P.M.[31]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting records, however, are those furnished by the\r\nmagnetographs at Lisbon, Parc Saint-Maur (near Paris), Greenwich, and\r\nWilhelmshaven. At Lisbon, the records are extremely clear. The curves\r\nof the declination, horizontal force and vertical force magnets, as\r\nseen in Fig. 21, are abruptly broken at 8.33 P.M. (Lisbon time, or 9h.\r\n9m. 45s., G.M.T.). The disturbances, which are greatest on the\r\ndeclination curve and least on the vertical force curve, lasted in all\r\nthree for about 12 minutes, and are quite distinct from the ordinary\r\nmagnetic perturbations. At Parc Saint-Maur, the magnetographs seem to\r\nbe ill-adapted to act as seismographs, for only a slight mark was\r\ndiscovered on a re-examination of the curves, beginning at 9.24 P.M.\r\n(Paris time, or 9h. 14m. 39s., G.M.T.) At Greenwich, Mr. W. Ellis\r\nwrites, there was \"a small simultaneous disturbance of the declination\r\nand horizontal force magnets, occurring at 9h. 15m.... Both magnets\r\nwere at this time set into slight vibration, the extent of vibration\r\nin the case of declination being about 2' of arc, and in horizontal\r\nforce equivalent to .001 of the whole horizontal force nearly.\" Of the\r\nthree instruments at Wilhelmshaven, only one showed any movement at\r\nthe time of the earthquake. The declination magnet was undisturbed,\r\nthe horizontal force curve was accidentally interrupted, but the\r\nvertical force curve indicated a very perceptible shock. Beginning at\r\n9.52 P.M. (Wilhelmshaven mean time, or 9h. 29m. 29s., G.M.T.), the\r\ncurve was broken for four minutes, for the rapid swinging of the\r\nneedle could not be registered until the motion became fainter.\r\nFurther disturbances also occurred at 9.59, 10, 10.2, and 10.5\r\nP.M.[32]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Magnetograph records of Andalusian\r\n   earthquake at Lisbon. (_Fouqué, etc._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE EPICENTRE.\r\n\r\nThe innermost isoseismal being too large, and the time-records too\r\ninaccurate, to give the position of the epicentre, both Commissions\r\nresorted to observations of the direction, Professor Fouqué and his\r\ncolleagues depending chiefly on the oscillation of hanging lamps, and\r\nProfessors Taramelli and Mercalli on the fall or displacement of\r\nstatues and other objects, and all avoiding as far as possible the\r\nevidence of fissures in buildings.\r\n\r\nThe Italian observers point out that, among the divergent directions\r\nvisible at any place, there is generally one more distinctly marked\r\nthan the others, and this, they consider, corresponds to the movement\r\ncoming almost directly from the centre of disturbance. Plotting these\r\ndirections (36 in number), they find that they converge as a rule\r\nwithin the triangle formed by joining Ventas de Zafarraya, Alhama, and\r\nJatar, while a large number of them traverse the elliptical area,\r\nwhose boundary is represented by the dotted line in Fig. 19. This area\r\nis about 9 miles long and 2-1/2 miles wide, its longer axis runs\r\nnearly east and west, and its centre coincides with the western focus\r\nof the ellipse which forms the boundary of the meizoseismal area. It\r\nlies, moreover, close to Ventas de Zafarraya and Arenas del Rey, the\r\ntwo places where the seismic death-rate was highest, while its major\r\naxis almost coincides with the line joining them.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of hanging lamps collected by the French Commission was\r\nmore consistent than that of the fallen objects. At every place, the\r\nplane in which the lamps oscillated was nearly constant, the\r\ndeviations being generally attributable to irregularities in the mode\r\nof suspension. The azimuths again intersect within an elliptical area,\r\nwhich, according to the Commission, differs little from the central\r\nregion of the earthquake (Fig. 20). It Is clear, however, from the map\r\naccompanying the French report, that the majority converge towards a\r\nnarrow band extending east and west from near Arenas del Rey to near\r\nVentas de Zafarraya, and therefore agreeing closely with the\r\nepicentral area as determined by Professors Taramelli and\r\nMercalli.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF THE SEISMIC FOCUS.\r\n\r\nIf the depth of the seismic focus amounts to several miles, one of the\r\nmost serious objections to Mallet's method lies in the varying\r\nrefractive power of the different strata traversed by the earth-waves\r\n(p. 28). At present we have no way of meeting this objection, and all\r\ncalculations of the depth of the focus are therefore more or less\r\ndoubtful. A difficulty in practice has also been urged, depending on\r\nthe widely differing inclinations of the fractures at any place; but\r\nthe Italian observers found that the errors from this source were\r\ngreatly reduced by avoiding all fissures in poorly-built houses, or\r\nwhich start from windows or other apertures, and selecting only those\r\nwhich occur in homogeneous walls directed towards the epicentre. The\r\nbest angles of emergence thus measured by them are thirteen in number,\r\nall made at places lying within 5 and 23 miles from the centre of the\r\nepicentral area, and, with two exceptions, inside the meizoseismal\r\nzone (Fig. 19). The depths corresponding to the different wave-paths\r\nvary from 5.3 to 23.0 miles, the mean depth of the focus given by all\r\nthirteen observations being 7.6 miles.\r\n\r\nThe only estimate made by the French Commission--and it is one that\r\nthey rightly regarded with considerable doubt--was based on a method\r\ndevised by Falb. As the sound generally precedes the shock, Falb\r\nassumes that it travels with a greater velocity. If the velocities of\r\nboth series of waves are known, and if they start at the same instant\r\nand from the same region, the interval that elapses between the\r\narrivals of the sound and shock should give the distance traversed by\r\nthem and consequently the depth of the focus. It is unnecessary to\r\nmention more than two of the serious objections to this method. The\r\nduration of the preliminary sound should increase rapidly with the\r\ndistance from the focus, and of this there is not the slightest\r\nevidence. Moreover, the sound-vibrations that are first heard do not\r\nnecessarily come from the same part of the focus as those which cause\r\nthe shock, but, as will be seen in Chapter VIII., probably from its\r\nnearer lateral margin. The French Commission, finding the average\r\nduration of the fore-sound near the epicentre to be 5 seconds,\r\nestimate the depth of the focus at about 7 miles--a result which\r\nagrees remarkably with that obtained from the angles of emergence, but\r\nwhich is not, on that account, entitled to credit.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of the shock, there was a singular uniformity throughout\r\nthe whole disturbed area, the chief variation noticed being evidently\r\ndependent on the observer's distance from the epicentre.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the meizoseismal area (Fig. 19), at Ventas de\r\nZafarraya, a loud sound like thunder was first heard, and before it\r\nceased there came a violent subsultory movement preceded by a very\r\nbrief oscillation, then a pause of one or two seconds, and lastly a\r\nmore intense and longer series of undulations, the whole movement\r\nlasting 12 seconds. At Cacin, three phases were distinguished, the\r\nfirst a slight undulatory movement coincident with the sound, followed\r\nimmediately by the subsultory motion, a pause, and stronger\r\nundulations, the total duration being 15 seconds. The variations\r\nnoticeable in this zone seem to have been apparent only, sensitive\r\nobservers perceiving a tremulous motion before the vertical\r\nvibrations, and in the pause between them and the concluding\r\nundulations. In both phases, the intensity increased to a maximum and\r\nthen gradually decreased. The movement at Ventas de Zafarraya and\r\nCacin is represented by Professors Taramelli and Mercalli by the\r\ncurves _a_ and _b_ in Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nIn the second zone (Fig. 19), the same two phases were universally\r\nobserved, but the subsultory movement was less pronounced or the\r\nmovement was partly subsultory and partly undulatory, and occasionally\r\nboth phases are described as undulatory. The motion near Malaga is\r\nrepresented by the curve _c_ in Fig. 22.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Nature of shock of Andalusian\r\n   earthquake. (_Taramelli and Mercalli._)]\r\n\r\nOutside the ruinous zone, the first phase rapidly lost what remained\r\nof its subsultory form, and the pause between the two parts was\r\nnoticeably longer than near the epicentre. Thus, at Seville and\r\nCordova, two shocks were felt, separated by an interval of some\r\nseconds; the second according to some observers at Seville,\r\nterminating with vertical tremors. At Madrid, also, the two parts were\r\nperceived, the interval between them being 3 or 4 seconds in length;\r\nbut, as a rule, outside Andalusia, only a single undulatory shock was\r\nfelt, without any preliminary sound.\r\n\r\nThat the changes observed in the shock were merely an effect of less\r\nor greater distance, will be obvious from Fig. 23, in which the\r\nintensity at any moment is that represented by the distance of the\r\ncorresponding point on the curve from the different base-lines, the\r\nbase-line _a_ corresponding to a place near the epicentre, and _b_,\r\n_c_, _d_, etc., to places at gradually increasing distances. Thus, at\r\na place corresponding to the base-line _b_, the intensity of the\r\ntremors during the intervening pause (represented by the short line\r\nPN) was so slight that they frequently escaped notice, while the\r\npreliminary tremors observed by some near the epicentre were\r\naltogether imperceptible. At the places corresponding to the\r\nbase-lines _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, the duration of the whole shock and of\r\neach part gradually diminished, while the interval between the two\r\nparts increased owing to the gradual extinction of the final\r\nvibrations of the first part and of the initial vibrations of the\r\nsecond. At the farthest of these places (_f_) the first part was so\r\nweak that it sometimes passed unobserved. Lastly, at a place\r\ncorresponding to the base-line _g_, the first part was imperceptible\r\nto all observers, and the shock consisted of a single series of\r\nhorizontal undulations.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Diagram to illustrate variation in\r\n   nature of shock of Andalusian earthquake.]\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Double Shock._--If the double shock were observed at\r\nonly a few places, we should naturally look for some local explanation\r\nof the peculiarity. The second shock, for instance, might be a\r\nsubterranean echo, the earth-waves being reflected at the bounding\r\nsurface of two different kinds of rock. In the case of the Andalusian\r\nearthquake, such an explanation is precluded by the almost universal\r\nobservation of the double shock, the greater intensity of the second\r\npart, and the longer period of its vibrations.\r\n\r\nThe Italian observers, who paid considerable attention to the double\r\nshock, give a more general explanation. They regard the two parts of\r\nthe shock as corresponding in the main to longitudinal and transversal\r\nwaves starting simultaneously from the same focus (see p. 13). The\r\nformer vibrations would be vertical at the epicentre and would\r\ngradually become horizontal in spreading outwards; the latter would be\r\nhorizontal at the epicentre and at a distance from it (_e.g._ at\r\nSeville) nearly vertical. Also, as the longitudinal waves travel more\r\nrapidly than others, the interval between the two parts of the shock\r\nwould increase with the distance from the origin. Owing again, to the\r\nlarge size of the focus, the first part of the shock would at no place\r\nbe instantaneous, and its later vibrations might coalesce with the\r\nearlier transverse vibrations, so that, within and near the\r\nmeizoseismal area, the second part of the shock might be stronger than\r\nthe first. A similar result might be produced in the same district if\r\nthe transverse vibrations coincided with reflected longitudinal\r\nvibrations, and Professors Taramelli and Mercalli think that such\r\nreflection would occur from the old crystalline rocks of the Sierra de\r\nAlmijara and possibly also from the calcareous and crystalline rocks\r\nto the south-west of Cartama.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory as it seems to be in some respects, this explanation is\r\nopen to serious objections, of which I will mention only two. The\r\nfirst is that, though the pause between the two parts of the shock\r\ndoes increase with the distance, it does not increase rapidly enough;\r\nat Seville, it should be two or three minutes, instead of \"some\r\nseconds\" in length. A more fatal objection, however, is that, if the\r\nexplanation were correct, every earthquake-shock should consist of two\r\nparts, and this is only the case with a small minority.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the velocities of the waves composing each part\r\nwere the same, the slight increase in the length of the interval is\r\nreadily accounted for, as we have seen, by the gradual extinction of\r\nits weak terminal vibrations. But in any case, the long interval that\r\nelapsed between the beginnings of the two parts at a place so near the\r\nepicentre as Ventas de Zafarraya, shows that each part was due to a\r\ndistinct impulse; and, judging from the directions of the respective\r\nmovements, it would seem that the focus of the first impulse was\r\nsituated at a greater depth than the focus of the second. Whether the\r\nepicentres corresponding to the two foci were coincident or more or\r\nless separate is not clear from the nature of the shock; but it is\r\nprobable that they were nearly or quite detached, and that a second\r\nepicentre was situated near the eastern focus of the ellipse bounding\r\nthe meizoseismal area.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND-PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\nIn the Neapolitan earthquake, the sound was only heard in a district\r\nof about 3,300 square miles immediately surrounding the epicentres,\r\nwhile the whole area disturbed by the shock was not less than 39,000\r\nsquare miles. A similar limitation was noticed in the Andalusian\r\nearthquake. According to the Spanish Commission, the sound was heard\r\nat only one place (Cordova) outside the provinces of Granada and\r\nMalaga; and its audibility was a rule confined to the area within\r\nwhich buildings were damaged by the shock. It was compared at\r\ndifferent places to the noise of a passing train or a carriage heavily\r\nladen running on a paved road, of distant thunder, a great storm, or\r\nthe discharge of heavy guns.\r\n\r\nAt every place where the sound was heard, it distinctly preceded the\r\nshock, frequently allowing time for escape from houses that were\r\nafterwards ruined. Its duration within the meizoseismal area was on an\r\naverage about five or six seconds, rarely perhaps did it exceed ten\r\nseconds. At some places in the same area, it overlapped the beginning\r\nof the shock, but generally it was separated from the latter by a very\r\nshort interval, estimated at a second. From this precedence of the\r\nsound, the Italian Commission conclude that the sound-waves travelled\r\nmore rapidly than those which formed the shock, an inference that\r\ndepends on the assumption that both waves started simultaneously from\r\nwithin precisely the same focal limits. A different explanation, not\r\nbased on these assumptions, will be considered more fully in Chapter\r\nVIII, dealing with the recent earthquakes of Hereford and Inverness.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF THE EARTH-WAVES.\r\n\r\nIf, in a highly-civilised country, the time-records of an earthquake\r\nvary within wide limits, it is not surprising that those given for the\r\nAndalusian earthquake should be wholly untrustworthy. Even the clocks\r\nin public buildings and railway stations differed by as much as 25\r\nminutes in their indications. An interesting observation is, however,\r\ndescribed in the French report and is worth repeating, though it does\r\nnot lead to any accurate result. At the time of the principal shock,\r\ntwo telegraph-clerks were in communication, one at Malaga and the\r\nother at Velez-Malaga. The latter, surprised by the shock, suddenly\r\nstopped his message; and, about six seconds later, the arrival of the\r\nearth-waves at Malaga explained the interruption to his colleague. As,\r\naccording to the French report, Velez-Malaga is 9 kms. (or about 5-1/2\r\nmiles) nearer than Malaga to the mean epicentral point, it follows\r\nthat the velocity of the earth-waves must have been about 1.5 kms., or\r\nnearly a mile, per second.[34]\r\n\r\nThe only observations of any real value in determining the velocity\r\nare those given by the stopped clock at the observatory of San\r\nFernando (Cadiz) and by the magnetographs at Lisbon, Parc Saint-Maur,\r\nGreenwich, and Wilhelmshaven. Taking the times at Cadiz, Lisbon,\r\nGreenwich, and Wilhelmshaven at 9.18, 9.19, 9.25, and 9.29 P.M.\r\nrespectively (Paris mean time) and the mean epicentral point as\r\ncoinciding with Alhama, the French Commission estimates roughly the\r\nmean surface-velocity between Cadiz and Lisbon at 3.6 kms. per second,\r\nbetween Cadiz and Greenwich at 4.5 kms. per second, between Cadiz and\r\nWilhelmshaven at 3.1 kms. per second, and between Greenwich and\r\nWilhelmshaven at 1.6 kms. per second. Dr. Agamennone, however,\r\nnotices that the distances from Alhama are not correctly measured, and\r\nsubstitutes for the above figures 4.83, 3.43, 2.82, and 1.75 kms. per\r\nsecond respectively.\r\n\r\nThese results apparently show a decrease in the velocity with the\r\noutward spread of the earth-waves, but, as Dr. Agamennone again points\r\nout, a comparatively small error in the time at Cadiz would neutralise\r\nthe apparent decrease. It is not to be supposed that the astronomical\r\nclock at this observatory was wrong by more than a second or two, but\r\nthe behaviour of clocks during an earthquake is so irregular--some\r\nstopping at once, others staggering on for some seconds before\r\narrest--that the Cadiz time may differ from the true time by several\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nBesides this possible error, there is also considerable uncertainty in\r\nthe records from the magnetic observatories, owing to the slow rate at\r\nwhich the photographic paper travels. At Parc Saint-Maur this rate is\r\nonly 10 mm. per hour, and at the other observatories about 15 mm. per\r\nhour. Allowing, therefore, for an error of half-a-minute in the\r\ntime-record at Cadiz, of one minute in those of Lisbon, Greenwich, and\r\nWilhelmshaven, and of two minutes in that at Parc Saint-Maur, and\r\ntaking the mean epicentral point as determined by the Italian\r\nobservers, Dr. Agamennone, applying the method of least squares, finds\r\nthe probable value of the velocity of propagation to be 3.15 kms. (or\r\nnearly 2 miles) per second, with a possible error of .19 kms. per\r\nsecond. This result agrees closely with the value found for the long\r\nslow undulations of more recent earthquakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n_Connection between Geological Structure and the Intensity of the\r\nShock._--While a great part of the injury to buildings must be\r\nattributed to their faulty construction, the connection between the\r\nnature of the underlying rock and the amount of damage was very\r\nclearly marked. Other conditions being the same, houses built on\r\nalluvial ground suffered most of all; and the destruction was also\r\ngreat in those standing on soft sedimentary rocks such as clays and\r\nfriable limestones. On the other hand, when compact limestones or\r\nancient schists formed the foundation-rock, the amount of damage was\r\nconspicuously less than in other cases.\r\n\r\nThe members of both the French and the Italian Commissions agree in\r\nascribing the peculiar form and relative positions of the isoseismal\r\nlines to geological conditions. To the east of the epicentre, the\r\nschists and crystalline limestones form a deep, uniform, and compact\r\nmass; while, to the west, the old crystalline rocks are covered by\r\njurassic, cretaceous, and eocene formations, constituting a less\r\nhomogeneous and less elastic mass, in which the intensity of the shock\r\nwould fade off much more rapidly, with the result that the epicentre\r\noccupies the western focus of the elliptical boundary of the\r\nmeizoseismal area (Fig. 19).[35]\r\n\r\nThat mountain-ranges have an important influence on the form of\r\nisoseismal lines is evident from both maps (Figs. 19 and 20), but\r\nespecially from that published by the French Commission (Fig. 20).\r\nThe resistance offered by the Sierra Nevada to the propagation of the\r\nearth-waves is shown in the former map by the approximation of the\r\nfirst and second isoseismals at the east end, and in the latter by the\r\ngreat bay in the third isoseismal line. Whichever interpretation of\r\nthe evidence is the more accurate, the action of the mountainous mass\r\nis clearly to lessen rapidly the intensity of the shock--an effect\r\nwhich is probably due to the abrupt changes in the direction and\r\nnature of the strata encountered normally by the earth-waves. On the\r\nopposite side of the epicentre, the waves meet the Sierra de Ronda\r\nobliquely. In traversing this range, the shock lost a great part of\r\nits strength, while it continued to be felt severely along its eastern\r\nfoot, thus giving rise to the south-westerly extension of the third\r\nisoseismal in Fig. 20, and, though to a less extent, that of the\r\nsecond in Fig. 19.\r\n\r\n_Fissures, Landslips, etc._--The earthquake resulted in many\r\nsuperficial changes, such as fissures, landslips, and derangement of\r\nthe underground water-system--all changes of the same order as the\r\ndestruction of buildings--but, so far as known, in no fault-scarps or\r\nother external evidence of deep-seated movements.\r\n\r\nSome of the fissures were of great length. One of the most remarkable\r\noccurred at Guevejar, a village built on the south-west slope of the\r\nSierra de Cogollos. It was in the form of a horse-shoe, and was about\r\ntwo miles long, from ten to fifty feet wide, and of great depth. In\r\nits neighbourhood, innumerable small cracks appeared, some\r\nperpendicular and others parallel to the great fissure. The ground\r\nwithin, a bed of clay resting on limestone, also slid down towards the\r\nriver. Houses near the centre of the fissured tract were shifted as\r\nmuch as thirty yards within the first month, and others near its\r\nextremity about ten feet; while the accumulation of the material at\r\nthe south end of the fissure resulted in the formation of a small\r\nlake, of about 250 to 350 square yards in area and about 30 feet deep.\r\nAll streams within the fissured zone disappeared, and the spring,\r\nwhich provided the drinking-water of the village, ceased to flow.\r\n\r\nThe underground water-system was generally affected throughout the\r\ncentral area. In some places, mineral springs disappeared; in others,\r\nnew springs broke out or old ones flowed more abundantly. At Alhama,\r\nthe increased flow was accompanied by a permanent rise in temperature\r\nfrom 47° to 50° C., and by a marked change in character.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER-SHOCKS.\r\n\r\nFrequent after-shocks are a characteristic of the earthquakes of\r\nSouthern Spain. After the Cordova earthquake of 1170, they continued\r\nfor at least three years. The Murcian earthquake of 1828 was followed\r\nby 300 minor shocks during the next twenty-four hours, and for more\r\nthan a year slight tremors were often felt. For some time after the\r\ngreat earthquake of 1884, the movements of the ground were extremely\r\nnumerous in the immediate neighbourhood of the epicentre, farther away\r\nthey were rarer and of less intensity, and outside the area of damaged\r\nbuildings they were nearly absent.\r\n\r\nThus, during the night of December 25-26, 110 after-shocks were\r\ncounted at Jatar, from 14 to 17 at Alcaucin, Ventas de Huelma, Motril,\r\nCacin, Durcal, Malaga, etc.; about 11 at La Mala and Albuñuelas; 9 at\r\nVelez-Malaga and Lenteje; and from 5 to 7 at Frigiliana, Riogordo, and\r\nCartama. The strongest of these shocks occurred at 2.20 A.M., and,\r\nthough none was violent, several helped to complete the ruin of many\r\nhouses that had been damaged by the principal shock.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, after-shocks occurred almost daily until the end of\r\nMay, after which they became much less frequent. According to the list\r\ngiven in the Italian report, which closes at the end of January 1886,\r\n237 shocks were felt, 23 up to the end of December, 30 in January\r\n1885, 25 in February, 27 in March, 46 in April, and 43 in May. In June\r\n1885, only three are recorded, and the average number during each of\r\nthe following seven months lies between five and six. This list,\r\nhowever, does not include the very weak shocks,[36] for nearly all\r\nthose contained in it were felt as far as Malaga or its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe shocks varied considerably in intensity as well as in frequency,\r\nfive of them being much more violent than the rest. One that occurred\r\non December 30th was felt strongly in all the damaged area, two others\r\non January 3rd and 5th caused fresh injury to buildings, a fourth, on\r\nFebruary 27th, disturbed an area bounded roughly by the second\r\nisoseismal of the principal earthquake (Fig. 19), while the fifth and\r\nstrongest, that of April 11th, was felt over a large part of the zone\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nAt places within and near the meizoseismal area, earth-sounds were\r\nsometimes heard without any sensible shock; occasionally, also,\r\ntremors were felt with no attendant sound; but, as a rule, the shocks\r\nwere accompanied by sound, and in every such case, as in the principal\r\nearthquake, the sound preceded the shock, or at most was partly\r\ncontemporaneous with it.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the after-shocks resembled the principal earthquake in\r\ntheir division into two parts separated by an interval of rest or\r\nweaker movement from half a second to a second in length, though the\r\nwhole duration of the shock itself in no case exceeded five or six\r\nseconds. Occasionally, the likeness was still closer, in the\r\nsuccession of sound, subsultory motion and concluding horizontal\r\nundulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY OF THE MEIZOSEISMAL AREA AND ORIGIN OF THE EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nThe meizoseismal area and surrounding zones lie in the midst of the\r\nmountainous region that separates the basin of the Guadalquiver from\r\nthat of the Mediterranean, the essential structure of which, according\r\nto the geologists of the French Commission, is outlined in Fig. 24. In\r\nthis sketch-map, the lightly-shaded bands correspond to an upper\r\nseries of crystalline schists, and the cross-shaded bands to the lower\r\nseries of mica-schists and dolomites that form the anticlinal folds of\r\nthe Sierra de Ronda, the Sierra de Mijas, and the Sierra Tejeda.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the faulting and intense folding in the direction of\r\ntheir strikes, these rocks are also intersected by three nearly\r\nparallel transverse faults of post-Triassic age, which, aided by\r\nsubsequent denudation, have cut up the whole range into a number of\r\ndistinct sierras. They are represented by the broken lines in Fig. 24.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Structure of meizoseismal area of\r\n   Andalusian earthquake. (_Fouqué, etc._)]\r\n\r\nOne of these faults, that which passes near Motril, traverses the\r\nmeizoseismal area, whose boundary, as laid down by the French\r\nCommission, is indicated by the dotted line on the sketch-map.[37] In\r\nthe neighbourhood of Zafarraya, the fault intersects the broken\r\nanticlinal fold of the Sierra Tejeda, and the epicentre is thus\r\nsituated in one of the most disturbed tracts of the whole region. The\r\nevidence, both seismic and geological, is insufficient to support any\r\nprecise view as to the origin of the earthquake, but there can be\r\nlittle doubt that it was closely connected with movements along one or\r\nmore of the system of faults that intersect not far from Zafarraya.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.\r\n\r\n  1.

Fouqué).\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] These times correspond to about 9.10 and 9.25 P.M., Greenwich\r\nmean time. The earthquake stopped a clock at the Royal Observatory of\r\nSan Fernando (Cadiz), at 8h. 43m. 54.5s. mean local time,\r\ncorresponding to 9h. 8m. 44s., G.M.T.\r\n\r\n[32] The earthquake is also said to have been registered at the\r\nobservatory of Moncalieri, near Turin, but I have not been able to\r\nascertain the time of occurrence. A movement felt at about 10.20 P.M.\r\nat Ramsbury, in Wiltshire, was attributed to the earthquake, though\r\nthe time is about an hour too late. On December 26th, an astronomical\r\nclock was stopped at Brussels and its pillar displaced; and, on the\r\nevening of the same day, the large telescope at the observatory was\r\nalso found to have been shifted. These effects, it is suggested, were\r\ncaused by the Andalusian earthquake, but the connection between them\r\nseems to me very doubtful.\r\n\r\n[33] The French observers have also applied a method depending on the\r\ntime of occurrence of the shock. Joining places where the recorded\r\ntimes were the same, they notice that the perpendicular bisectors of\r\nthese lines intersect within an area which agrees practically with\r\nthat determined by the azimuths. The inaccuracy of the time-records\r\nmust, however, lessen the significance of this result.\r\n\r\n[34] Dr. Agamennone points out that, according to the Italian report,\r\nthe difference in distance is 22 kms. (or 13-3/4 miles), leading to a\r\nvelocity of about 3.6 kms., or 2.3 miles per second.\r\n\r\n[35] It should be remembered that it is not improbable that there were\r\ntwo detached epicentres, coinciding roughly with the two foci of this\r\ncurve.\r\n\r\n[36] Only eight are recorded during the night of December 25-26. On\r\nseveral occasions during April and May 1885, groups of slight shocks\r\nwere felt; but as their individual times are not given, they are\r\nregarded as equivalent to one shock each in the above totals.\r\n\r\n[37] The boundary, as drawn in this figure, differs slightly from that\r\ngiven in Fig. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CHARLESTON EARTHQUAKE OF AUGUST 31ST, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Charleston earthquake stands alone among the great earthquakes\r\ndescribed in this volume, and indeed among nearly all great\r\nearthquakes, in visiting a region where seismic disturbances were\r\nalmost unknown. Calabria and Ischia, the Riviera and Andalusia, Assam\r\nand the provinces of Mino and Owari in Japan, are all regions where\r\nearthquake-shocks are more or less frequent and occasionally of\r\ndestructive violence. But, from the foundation of Charleston in 1680\r\nuntil 1886, that is, for more than two centuries, it is probably not\r\ntoo much to say that few counties in Great Britain were so free from\r\nearthquakes as the State of South Carolina.[38]\r\n\r\nThe practical isolation of the earthquake of 1886 left its trace on\r\nthe character of the investigation. Not only were the observers\r\nuntrained, but the investigators themselves were unprepared. For\r\ninstance, the scale of intensity used in drawing the isoseismal lines\r\nwas not adopted until after the first letters of inquiry were issued.\r\nOn the other hand, nothing could exceed the energy and ability with\r\nwhich the epicentral tracts were examined by Mr. Earle Sloan and the\r\ncollection of time-records made by Mr. Everett Hayden. To them, and to\r\nMajor C.E. Dutton, whose valuable monograph supersedes all other\r\naccounts, we are indebted for the two chief additions to our knowledge\r\nresulting from the study of the Charleston earthquake. These are the\r\ndetermination of the double epicentre, and the measurement of the\r\nvelocity with which the earth-waves travelled.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMAGE CAUSED BY THE EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nThe land-area disturbed by the earthquake and the isoseismal lines are\r\nshown in Fig. 25, the small black oval area (which Includes\r\nCharleston) being that within which the greatest damage to buildings\r\noccurred. The chief part of the epicentre, however, lies from 12 to 15\r\nmiles to the west and north-west of Charleston, in a forest-clad\r\ndistrict, containing only two villages and various scattered houses.\r\n\r\nThe city of Charleston, whose population between 1880 and 1891\r\nincreased from fifty to fifty-five thousand, is built on a peninsula\r\nbetween the Cooper River on the east and the Ashley River on the\r\nsouth-west. Originally, this was an irregular tract of comparatively\r\nhigh and dry land, intersected by numerous creeks, which, as the city\r\ngrew, were filled up to the general level of the higher ground. It is\r\non this \"made land\" as a rule that the more serious damage to\r\nbuildings occurred.\r\n\r\nAt 9.51 P.M. (standard time of the 75th meridian), the great\r\nearthquake occurred, and, one minute later, there was left hardly a\r\nbuilding in the city that was not injured more or less seriously. \"The\r\ndestruction,\" as Major Dutton remarks, \"was not of that sweeping and\r\nunmitigated order which has befallen other cities, and in which every\r\nstructure built of material other than wood has been levelled\r\ncompletely to the earth in a chaos of broken rubble, beams, tiles, and\r\nplanking, or left in a condition practically no better.\" The number of\r\nhouses entirely demolished was not great, but several hundred lost a\r\nlarge part of their walls, and many were condemned as unsafe and\r\nafterwards pulled down. A board of inspectors, appointed to\r\ninvestigate the condition of the houses, reported that not one hundred\r\nout of fourteen thousand chimneys examined by them escaped damage, and\r\nthat 95 per cent. of those injured were broken off at the roof. The\r\ntotal cost of the necessary repairs, it was estimated, would amount to\r\nabout one million pounds.\r\n\r\nAccording to the official records, 27 persons were killed in\r\nCharleston during the earthquake, but, by cold, exposure, etc., this\r\nnumber was brought up to not less than 83. The number of persons\r\nwounded was never ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\nISOSEISMAL LINES AND DISTURBED AREA.\r\n\r\nIn drawing the isoseismal lines (represented by the continuous curves\r\nin Fig. 25), Major Dutton made use of the well-known Rossi-Forel scale\r\nof seismic intensity, a translation of which is given below.[39] The\r\ncurves range from the highest degree, 10, corresponding to disastrous\r\neffects on buildings, down to the lowest but one, 2, which would be\r\napplied to a shock felt only by a small number of persons at rest. It\r\nis evident, I think, that these lines cannot be regarded as drawn with\r\ngreat accuracy. The number of records (nearly 4000, from about 1,600\r\nplaces), great as it is, is hardly sufficient for the purpose; and\r\nmany were collected from newspapers. The circulars of inquiry also\r\ncontained no distinct questions corresponding to the different degrees\r\nof the scale employed, and therefore it is not always certain that the\r\nintensity recorded was the maximum observed. But, if the curves might\r\nhave varied in detail with a larger and more accurate series of\r\nobservations, they must represent in their main features the\r\ndistribution of seismic intensity throughout the disturbed area. One\r\npoint of importance is the partial earthquake-shadow in the region of\r\nthe Appalachian Mountains shown by the southward incurving of the\r\nisoseismals 4, 5, and 6, and especially by the first two of these\r\nlines. Another is the close grouping of the isoseismals in the State\r\nof Mississippi, illustrating a rapid fading of intensity as the\r\nearth-waves crossed the unconsolidated materials of the Mississippi\r\ndelta.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Isoseismal lines of Charleston\r\n   earthquake. (_Dutton, etc._)]\r\n\r\nOwing to the short distance between the epicentre and the sea-coast,\r\nit is impossible to make more than a rough estimate of the extent of\r\nthe disturbed area. Even when the boundary lies on land, it traverses\r\nsome districts which are thinly populated and others where the\r\ninhabitants are unobservant, and unlikely to notice the slow\r\noscillations which were alone perceptible at great distances. The\r\nshock was, however, felt at Boston (800 miles from the epicentre), La\r\nCrosse on the upper Mississippi (950 miles to the north-west), at\r\nseveral places in Cuba (between 700 and 710 miles), and in Bermuda\r\n(950 miles). To the south, the limits are unknown, there being no\r\nreport from Yucatan, the nearest point of which is distant about 930\r\nmiles. If we assume the disturbed area to have a mean radius of 950\r\nmiles, then it must have covered no less than 2,800,000 square miles.\r\nAnd, that this estimate is not excessive, will be evident from the\r\nfact that the land-area disturbed (including parts of the great lakes\r\nand inlets in the sea-coast) amounted to about 920,000 square miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR THE EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nThe preparation for the earthquake seems to have begun about three\r\nmonths before. During June, and even earlier, slight but undoubted\r\ntremors are said to have been felt in Charleston, but no record of\r\nthem was kept until about 8 A.M. on August 27th, when a decided\r\nearthquake occurred at Summerville, a village twenty-two miles to the\r\nnorth-west. The shock and sound were simultaneous, the shock a single\r\njolt or heavy jar, the sound loud and sudden; they were such as might\r\nhave been caused by the firing of a heavy cannon or the explosion of a\r\nboiler or blast of gunpowder. At 4.45 A.M. on August 28th, the shock\r\nand sound were repeated, only more strongly, the former being\r\ndistinctly felt as far as Charleston. During that day and the next,\r\nthere were several other shocks at Summerville, and then rest and\r\nquiet succeeded until the evening of August 31st.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nAt 9.51 P.M. (to take one of the best descriptions), the attention of\r\nan observer in Charleston was \"vaguely attracted by a sound that\r\nseemed to come from the office below, and was supposed for a moment to\r\nbe caused by the rapid rolling of a heavy body, as an iron safe or a\r\nheavily-laden truck, over the floor. Accompanying the sound there was\r\na perceptible tremor of the building, not more marked, however, than\r\nwould be caused by the passage of a car or dray along the street. For\r\nperhaps two or three seconds the occurrence excited no surprise or\r\ncomment. Then by swift degrees, or all at once--it is difficult to say\r\nwhich--the sound deepened in volume, the tremor became more decided,\r\nthe ear caught the rattle of window-sashes, gas-fixtures, and other\r\nmovable objects; the men in the office ... glanced hurriedly at each\r\nother and sprang to their feet.... And then all was bewilderment and\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\"The long roll deepened and spread into an awful roar, that seemed to\r\npervade at once the troubled earth and the still air above and around.\r\nThe tremor was now a rude, rapid quiver, that agitated the whole\r\nlofty, strong-walled building as though it were being shaken--shaken\r\nby the hand of an immeasurable power, with intent to tear its joints\r\nasunder and scatter its stones and bricks abroad....\r\n\r\n\"There was no intermission in the vibration.... From the first to the\r\nlast it was a continuous jar, adding force with every moment, and, as\r\nit approached and reached the climax of its manifestation, it seemed\r\nfor a few terrible seconds that no work of human hands could possibly\r\nsurvive the shocks. The floors were heaving under-foot, the\r\nsurrounding walls and partitions visibly swayed to and fro, the crash\r\nof falling masses of stone and brick and mortar was heard overhead and\r\nwithout....\r\n\r\n\"For a second or two it seemed that the worst had passed, and that the\r\nviolent motion was subsiding. It increased again and became as severe\r\nas before. None expected to escape. A sudden rush was simultaneously\r\nmade to endeavor to attain the open-air and fly to a place of safety;\r\nbut, before the door was reached all stopped short, as by a common\r\nimpulse, feeling that hope was vain--that it was only a question of\r\ndeath within the building or without, of being buried beneath the\r\nsinking roof or crushed by the falling walls. The uproar slowly died\r\naway in seeming distance. The earth was still, and oh! the blessed\r\nrelief of that stillness.\"\r\n\r\nIf somewhat sensational in form, this report gives an extremely vivid\r\nand generally accurate account of the great shock. Other observers in\r\nCharleston concur in dividing the movement into five phases. The\r\npreliminary tremors and murmuring sound lasted about twelve seconds,\r\nand, although they increased in strength, they were succeeded somewhat\r\nsuddenly by the violent oscillations of the second phase, followed by\r\na third phase of much less intensity and a fourth of stronger\r\noscillations, these three phases lasting altogether about fifty\r\nseconds. The fifth phase, in which the tremors died out rather\r\nrapidly, continued about eight seconds; so that the total duration of\r\nthe earthquake was not less than seventy seconds. The variation of the\r\nintensity with the time is represented roughly by the curve in Fig.\r\n26.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 26.--Curve of intensity at Charleston.\r\n   (_Dutton._)]\r\n\r\nAt Charleston, there were thus two decided maxima of intensity, nearly\r\nequal in strength, though the first seems to have been slightly more\r\npowerful than the second. As in the Andalusian earthquake, the\r\nintervening tremors were imperceptible at a distance from the\r\nepicentre, and the earthquake appeared in the form of two distinct\r\nshocks, separated by an interval the average duration of which was\r\nestimated at slightly less than half a minute. At most places, the\r\nfirst shock is described as the stronger, but the difference in\r\nintensity of the two parts could not have been great, for both were\r\nnoticed at several places more than 600 miles from the epicentre.\r\n\r\n_Visible Earth-Waves._--Many persons in the meizoseismal area assert\r\nthat they saw waves moving along the surface of the ground. At\r\nCharleston, according to an observer who was facing a street-lamp at\r\nthe time, \"the progress of the waves as they passed the house, going\r\ntowards the south-east, was plainly observed, although they travelled\r\nwith incomparable swiftness. The shadow of each moving ridge cast from\r\nthe gas-light was distinctly seen. The waves were not in long rollers,\r\nbut had rather the appearance of 'ground-swells' in deep water,\" the\r\nheight of which from crest to trough he estimated at not less than two\r\nfeet. In the words of another observer, \"The vibrations increased\r\nrapidly and the ground began to undulate like the sea. The street was\r\nwell lighted, having three gas-lamps within a distance of 200 feet,\r\nand I could see the earth waves as they passed as distinctly as I have\r\na thousand times seen the waves roll along Sullivan's Island beach.\r\nThe first wave came from the south-west, and as I attempted to make my\r\nway ... I was borne irresistibly across from the south side to the\r\nnorth side of the street. The waves seemed then to come from both the\r\nsouth-west and north-west, and crossed the street diagonally,\r\nintersecting each other, and lifting me up and letting me down as if I\r\nwere standing on a chop sea. I could see perfectly, and made careful\r\nobservations, and I estimate that the waves were at least two feet in\r\nheight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOUBLE EPICENTRE.\r\n\r\nFor seismological purposes, it is unfortunate that the epicentral\r\ndistrict should be one containing so few buildings and other objects\r\nthat could preserve the effects of the shock. It is for the most part\r\na barren, forest-clad region, in places swampy, with occasional\r\nscattered houses. But it is crossed by three lines of railway\r\ndiverging from Charleston, and the damage which they suffered\r\nsupplements to some extent the defects arising from the scarcity of\r\nbuildings. These railway lines are the South Carolina, the\r\nNorth-Eastern, and the Charleston and Savannah, denoted by the letters\r\nA, B, and C, respectively, in Figs. 28 and 29.[40] It will be\r\nconvenient to follow Major Dutton, and trace the variation of\r\nintensity exhibited along each line.\r\n\r\nFor six miles along the South Carolina Railway (A) the damage to the\r\nline, though indicative of a strong shock, was of little consequence.\r\nIn the first half of this distance no repairs were required, but at\r\n3-2/3 miles the rails were bent and the joints between them opened; at\r\n5 miles, the fish-plates were torn from their fastenings and the\r\njoints between the rails opened seven inches; and at nearly 6 miles\r\nthe joints were again opened, and the road-bed depressed six inches.\r\nAfter this point, deflections of the line and elevations and\r\ndepressions of the road-bed were no longer rare. Near the 9-mile\r\npoint, the intensity of the shock seemed to increase most rapidly;\r\nlateral displacements of the line became more frequent as well as\r\ngreater in amount. The distortions of the lines were probably greatest\r\nbetween 10 and 11 miles; here they were often displaced laterally,\r\nsometimes depressed or elevated, and occasionally twisted into\r\nS-shaped curves, while many hundred yards of the track were shoved\r\nbodily towards the south-east. \"The buckling always took place when\r\nthis lateral shoving encountered a rigid obstacle, usually a long\r\nrigid trestle. At the north-western end of the trestle the\r\naccumulation of rails resulted in a sharp kink. Corresponding\r\nextensions of the track by the opening of the joints and shearing of\r\nthe fish-plate bolts occurred some distance to the north-westward.\" At\r\n11-1/2 miles, the lines were again stretched and the joints opened by\r\nabout seven inches; but, from this point for more than four miles, the\r\nsharp kinks revealing a sliding of the track were entirely absent,\r\nthough there were still long slight flexures in the lines and changes\r\nof level in the road-bed. The railway in this section traverses a\r\ndistrict which is partly a swamp and partly a rice-field; and thus it\r\nmay be, as Major Dutton suggests, that the ground was less fitted to\r\npreserve the effects of the shock.[41] At about 18 miles, the line\r\nreaches higher and firmer ground; and, from here to Summerville\r\n(21-2/3 miles), there were many sinuous flexures. For six miles\r\nfarther, violent distortions of the rails ceased to occur, the rate of\r\ndecrease in intensity being most marked near the 23-mile point. The\r\nlast flexure occurred at Jedburgh (27-1/2 miles) at the south end of a\r\nlong, heavy trestle (Fig. 27).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Flexure of rails at Jedburgh.\r\n   (_Dutton._)]\r\n\r\nThere is thus a certain symmetry in the damage to this line with\r\nrespect to a point about 15 or 16 miles from the Charleston terminus.\r\nThe changes of intensity are most rapid at distances of about 9 and 23\r\nmiles from the terminus. Also, on the south-east side of the 16-mile\r\npoint, the longitudinal displacements of the line are always to the\r\nsouth-east; on the other side, always to the north-west. Major Dutton\r\ntherefore infers that the epicentre must be on a line drawn nearly\r\nthrough the 16-mile point at right angles to the railway.\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar changes were noted along the North-Eastern Railway\r\n(B), the Charleston terminus of which is about three-quarters of a\r\nmile to the south-east of that of the South Carolina Railway. Slight\r\nflexures in the line occurred at distances of 1-1/2 and 4 miles from\r\nthe terminus, and at about 6 miles the road-bed was depressed, in one\r\npart by as much as 22 inches. At about 6-1/3 miles, the joints between\r\nthe rails were opened 14 inches, and there were slight sinuous\r\nflexures in the line near the 7-mile and 8-mile points. The\r\nindications of great intensity then rapidly increased, the rate of\r\nchange being greatest near the 9-mile point. Here, there was a long\r\nlateral flexure with a shift of 4 inches eastward. Half-a-mile\r\nfarther, the fish-plates were broken and the rails parted 8-1/2\r\ninches. A little beyond the 10-mile point, an embankment 15 feet high\r\nwas pushed 4-1/2 feet eastward along a chord of 150 feet. At the\r\n12-mile point and beyond, fish-plates were broken, lines were bent and\r\nthe joints opened; the road-bed was cut by a series of cracks, one of\r\nwhich was 21 inches wide, while the beginning of a long trestle was\r\nshifted 8-1/3 feet to the west. From 12-1/2 to 14-1/2 miles, several\r\nbuildings were damaged or destroyed by a movement which was clearly\r\nmore vertical than horizontal. Near the 16-mile point, the ground was\r\nfissured and thrown into ridges, the rails being similarly bent in a\r\nvertical plane. Soon after this, the line reaches a broad, sandy\r\ntract, and, though the thickness of the sand is probably not much more\r\nthan 40 feet in any place, the disturbances diminish almost at once,\r\nand, for a distance of more than two miles, there was little damage\r\ndone to the line. At Mount Holly Station (18 miles), the intensity was\r\nso slight that the houses suffered no injury more serious than the\r\nloss of chimneys. Half-a-mile farther, the ground becomes less sandy,\r\nand the effects of the shock more distinct. The lines were bent in\r\nplaces for about a quarter of a mile, after which they again pass into\r\nthe sandy area with a decrease of damage, the last flexure being near\r\nthe 21-mile point. The rate of change of intensity in this part of the\r\nline appears to have been greatest at a distance of about 19-1/2 miles\r\nfrom the terminus, but the exact distance is obviously somewhat\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nThere is again a rough symmetry in the damage to the line, the central\r\npoint being about 14 miles from the Charleston terminus. A line drawn\r\nthrough this point at right angles to the North-Eastern Railway (or\r\nrather to that part of it between the 9-mile and 19-1/2-mile points)\r\nshould pass through the epicentre. It meets the corresponding line for\r\nthe South Carolina Railway in a point which is indicated in Figs. 27\r\nand 28 by a small circle (W). Houses and other buildings are rare in\r\nthe surrounding district; but, as the intensity of the shock\r\ndiminished outwards in all directions, this point must mark\r\napproximately the position of the epicentre. As it is close to the\r\nWoodstock Station on the South Carolina Railway, it is called by Major\r\nDutton the Woodstock epicentre.\r\n\r\nThe Charleston and Savannah Railway (C) uses the same lines as the\r\nNorth-Eastern for the first seven miles from Charleston, and then\r\nturns off in a south-westerly direction. For 4-1/2 miles from the\r\njunction the signs of disturbance were few and unimportant. The\r\nrailway then crosses the Ashley River, the banks of which slid towards\r\none another and jammed the drawbridge; but for four miles farther\r\nthere was no serious damage done to the lines. At about 16-1/2 miles\r\nthe effects of the shock became rapidly more apparent. For nearly\r\n1-1/2 mile the entire railroad was deflected into an irregular curve,\r\nthe displacement being greatest at the bridge, where it crosses the\r\nStono River. Here, it was as much as 37 inches to the south. After\r\nRantowles Station (18 miles), there were many displacements, both\r\nlateral and vertical. At 18-1/2 miles, a long southward deflection\r\nbegan, the amount of which reached 25 inches at the 19-mile point, 50\r\ninches half-a-mile farther on, and was still greater at 20-2/3 miles.\r\nFor two miles more, sinuous flexures were continuous, but, at the\r\n22-2/3-mile point, they rapidly disappeared, the railroad passing on\r\nto higher and firmer ground. Between 25 and 27 miles, there were\r\noccasional slight flexures in the line or depressions of the railroad;\r\nbut, after the 27-1/4-mile point, they seldom occur, and, when they\r\ndo, are of little consequence.\r\n\r\nSome of the effects described in the last paragraph may, as Major\r\nDutton suggests, be due to the varying nature of the surface-rocks. It\r\nis important to notice, however, that disturbances of the lines were\r\nexceedingly rare in the section that lies nearest to the Woodstock\r\nepicentre, and that they increase in violence for some distance from\r\nthat region, the maximum intensity being reached a mile or two to the\r\nwest of Rantowles Station. This points clearly to the existence of a\r\nsecond focus. Unfortunately, there are very few houses or other\r\nobjects in the neighbourhood, and the position of the corresponding\r\nepicentre cannot be determined accurately. Major Dutton places it in\r\nthe position indicated by a small circle (R), and calls it the\r\nRantowles epicentre from its vicinity to the station of that name.\r\n\r\nIf the meizoseismal area had been a thickly populated one, the\r\nevidence of ruined and damaged houses would have provided materials\r\nfor the construction of isoseismal lines surrounding the two\r\nepicentres. It is difficult, as it is, to gauge the equality of the\r\neffects on objects so different as railway-lines and buildings; and\r\nthe isoseismals shown in Figs. 28 and 29 can therefore lay no claim to\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nFig. 28 shows the epicentral isoseismals as they are drawn by Mr.\r\nEarle Sloan. They do not correspond to the degrees of any definite\r\nscale of seismic intensity; but they may be taken as representing the\r\nimpressions of a very careful observer, who traversed the district\r\nimmediately after the occurrence of the earthquake, and who, when\r\ndrawing these lines, was biassed by no preconceived theory.\r\n\r\nMajor Dutton, relying chiefly on Mr. Sloan's written notes, interprets\r\nthe evidence differently, and obtains the series of curves shown in\r\nFig. 29. In this case, also, the isoseismals correspond to no\r\nexpressed standard of intensity. They are intended merely to represent\r\nthe forms of the curves, and, by their less or greater distance apart,\r\nthe more or less rapid rate at which the intensity varied.\r\n\r\nThe chief difference between the two maps concerns the form of the\r\nWoodstock isoseismals. Major Dutton draws them approximately\r\ncircular, leaving the map blank towards the north, where hardly any\r\nevidence was forthcoming. Mr. Sloan attributes the scantiness of\r\neffects here to a diminution of intensity, and makes the lines curve\r\nin towards the epicentre. They certainly must do so in crossing the\r\nNorth-Eastern Railway; and the somewhat southerly trend of Mr. Sloan's\r\ncurves to the east of this railway seems to me to furnish the better\r\nrepresentation of the distinctly greater intensity in that region.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Epicentral isoseismal lines of\r\n   Charleston earthquake according to Mr. Sloan. (_Dutton._)]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 29.--Epicentral isoseismal lines of\r\n   Charleston earthquake according to Major Dutton. (_Dutton._)]\r\n\r\nMore important, however, than this divergence of opinion is the\r\nagreement in one respect between the two sets of curves. Both show a\r\nmarked expansion around the points known as the Woodstock and\r\nRantowles epicentres, especially about the former, and a contraction\r\nin the intermediate region. The evidence of these isoseismals\r\ntherefore confirms that of the damaged railway lines, and establishes\r\nMajor Dutton's inference that there were two distinct foci, the\r\nepicentres of which were about thirteen miles apart.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE DOUBLE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter, it was shown that the double shock of the\r\nAndalusian earthquake could be due only to two distinct impulses\r\ntaking place either within the same focus or, more probably, in two\r\ndetached foci. Similar reasoning applies to the Charleston earthquake.\r\nThe double maximum or double shock was observed in no less than\r\nfourteen States. Moreover, the interval between the two maxima at\r\nCharleston appears from Fig. 26 to have been about 34 seconds in\r\nlength. Thus, the duplication of the shock cannot have been a merely\r\nlocal phenomenon, nor can it have resulted from the separation into\r\ntwo parts of the earth-waves proceeding from a single disturbance.\r\nEach maximum must therefore be connected with a distinct impulse.\r\n\r\nCombining this inference with Major Dutton's discovery of the double\r\nfocus, no doubt can remain as to the origin of the repeated shock. It\r\nis clear, also, that the impulse at the Woodstock focus was the\r\nstronger of the two; for the isoseismals spread out more widely round\r\nthe corresponding epicentre, and there was no rapid decline of\r\nintensity from that point, such as might be associated with a weaker\r\ndisturbance within a shallow focus.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 30.--Planes of oscillation of stopped\r\n   pendulum clocks at Charleston.]\r\n\r\nAgain, since the earlier part of the shock is almost uniformly\r\ndescribed as the stronger, it follows that the Woodstock focus was the\r\nfirst in action. A curious fact recorded by Major Dutton supports this\r\ninference. In Charleston, four clocks were stopped by the shock, the\r\nerrors of which at the time were certainly less than eight or nine\r\nseconds. The planes in which their pendulums oscillated are shown by\r\nthe lines lettered A, B, C, and D in Fig. 30, the broken lines W and R\r\nrepresenting respectively the directions from Charleston of the\r\nWoodstock and Rantowles epicentres. Clock A stopped at 9h. 51m. 0s., B\r\nat 9h. 51m. 15s., C at 9h. 51m. 16s., and D (which had been reset to\r\nthe second earlier in the day) at 9h. 51m. 48s. Now, if the plane of\r\noscillation coincided nearly with the direction of the shock, the only\r\neffect would be a temporary change in the period of oscillation; but\r\nif it was at right angles to the direction of the shock, the clock\r\nmight be stopped by the point of the pendulum catching behind the\r\ngraduated arc in front of which it oscillated. The planes of the first\r\nthree clocks, it will be seen, were approximately at right angles to\r\nthe direction of the Woodstock epicentre, and B and C were indeed\r\nstopped in the manner just described; while the plane of shock D was\r\nnearly perpendicular to the direction of the Rantowles epicentre. As\r\nthe pendulums of B and C might make a few staggering oscillations\r\nbefore their final arrest, Major Dutton assigns 9h. 51m. 12s. as the\r\nepoch of the first maximum at Charleston; and, as the interval between\r\nthe two maxima was about 34 seconds, this would give about 9h. 51m.\r\n46s. for the epoch of the second maximum--a time which agrees very\r\nclosely with that given by clock D. Thus, clocks A, B, and C must have\r\nbeen stopped by the Woodstock vibrations, and clock D about\r\nhalf-a-minute later by those coming from the Rantowles focus.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF THE SEISMIC FOCI.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of estimating the depth of the seismic focus have been\r\ndescribed in the preceding pages--namely, Mallet's, depending on the\r\nangle of emergence, and Falb's, based on the interval between the\r\ninitial epochs of the sound and shock. To these, Major Dutton adds a\r\nthird method, in which he relies on the rate at which the intensity of\r\nthe shock varies with the distance from the epicentre.\r\n\r\n_Dutton's Method of determining the Depth of the Focus._--If the\r\nseismic focus is either a point or a sphere, and the initial impulse\r\nequal in all directions, and if the intensity of the shock diminishes\r\ninversely as the square of the distance from the focus, then the\r\ncontinuous curve in Fig. 31 will represent the variation of intensity\r\nalong a line passing through the epicentre E. The form of the curve on\r\nthese assumptions does not depend in any way on the initial intensity\r\nof the impulse; it is governed solely by the depth of the focus. The\r\ndeeper the focus, the flatter becomes the curve, as we have seen in\r\ndiscussing the Ischian earthquakes (p. 68). In all directions from the\r\nepicentre, the intensity at first diminishes slowly; but the rate of\r\nchange of intensity with the distance soon becomes more rapid, until\r\nit is a maximum at the points C, C; after which it again diminishes\r\nand dies out very slowly when the distance becomes great. It will be\r\nevident from Fig. 18 that the deeper the focus the greater also is the\r\ndistance EC of the points where the intensity of the shock changes\r\nmost rapidly. It may be easily shown, indeed, that this distance\r\nalways bears to the depth of the focus the constant ratio of 1 to\r\nsqrt(3), or about 1 to 1.73.[42]\r\n\r\nNow, if a series of isoseismals could be drawn corresponding to\r\nintensities which differ by constant amounts, we should have a series\r\nof circles like those surrounding the Woodstock epicentre in Fig. 29,\r\nthe distance between successive lines at first decreasing gradually\r\nuntil it is a minimum at the dotted circle and afterwards gradually\r\nincreasing. This dotted circle is obviously that which passes through\r\nall points where the intensity of the shock changes most rapidly.\r\nMajor Dutton calls it the _index-circle_ and, when its radius is\r\nknown, the depth of the focus is at once obtained by multiplying the\r\nradius by 1.73.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, Mallet proposed a method which bears some resemblance to the\r\nabove,[43] but depending only on the intensity of the longitudinal\r\nwaves. Major Dutton claims for his method that the effects of the\r\nlongitudinal and transverse waves are not separated, that it takes\r\naccount of the \"total energy irrespective of direction or kind of\r\nvibration.\"\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Diagram to illustrate Dutton's method of\r\n   determining depth of seismic focus.]\r\n\r\n_Objections to Dutton's Method._--I have described this method\r\nsomewhat fully, though it seems to me open to more serious objections\r\nthan Mallet's first method which it is intended to replace.\r\n\r\nWe have, in the first place, no reason for supposing that the focus is\r\neither a point or a sphere, or that the initial impulse is uniform in\r\nall directions. If the earthquake were caused by fault-slipping, both\r\nassumptions would be untrue, and it is for those who employ the method\r\nto prove their validity.\r\n\r\nBut of greater consequence is the fact that, if the method were\r\ncorrect, all earthquakes originating at the same depth must have\r\nindex-circles of equal radii. If the depth of the focus were, say, ten\r\nmiles, then the index-circle must have a radius of about six miles,\r\nwhether the initial disturbance be of extreme violence or so weak that\r\nit is not felt at the surface at all, much less so far as six miles\r\nfrom the epicentre. The law of the inverse square is of course only\r\ntrue for a perfectly elastic and continuous medium, and the real curve\r\nof intensity is not that of the continuous line in Fig. 31, but\r\nsomething of the form represented by the dotted line. In this case,\r\nthe rate of change of intensity is greatest at some point C', nearer\r\nthan C to the epicentre, and the application of Major Dutton's rule\r\nwould give a point F', nearer the surface than F, for the focus. Thus,\r\nassuming that the method can be applied in practice--and the test\r\ninvolved is one so delicate that it would be difficult to apply except\r\nwith refined measurements--then all that we can assert is that the\r\ncalculated depth is certainly less than the true depth.\r\n\r\n_Dutton's Estimate of the Depth of the Seismic Foci._--In applying the\r\nmethod, the chief difficulty is to obtain a series of isoseismal lines\r\ncorresponding to equidistant degrees of intensity. As already pointed\r\nout, those given in Fig. 29 are merely diagrammatic; but the\r\nindex-circle of the Woodstock focus, represented by the dotted line,\r\nis made to pass through the places where the rate of change of\r\nintensity was found to be greatest. The radius of this circle being\r\nvery nearly seven miles, it follows that the resulting depth of the\r\nWoodstock focal point would be about twelve miles. Major Dutton\r\nregards this estimate as probably correct within two miles.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of the Rantowles epicentre, the isoseismals in\r\nboth Figs. 28 and 29 are elongated in form. The _index-circuit_, as it\r\nwould be called in such a case, cannot be drawn completely, but its\r\nradius parallel to the shorter axis of the curves is about 4-1/2\r\nmiles, and the resulting depth of the Rantowles focal point would be\r\nnearly eight miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF THE EARTH-WAVES.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the double epicentre is, from a geological point of\r\nview, the most important fact established by the investigation of the\r\nCharleston earthquake. But of equal interest, from a physical point of\r\nview, is the estimate of the velocity of the earth-waves, which is\r\nprobably more accurate than that determined for any previous shock.\r\nOwing to the existence of the standard time system in the United\r\nStates, the exact time is transmitted once a day to every town and\r\nvillage within reach of a telegraph line; and the effect of small\r\nerrors in the observations is considerably lessened by the great\r\ndistance traversed by the earth-waves, sixty good reports coming from\r\nplaces more than 500 miles from the epicentre, and ten from places\r\nmore than 800 miles distant.\r\n\r\nThe total number of time-records collected is 316, but of these 130\r\nhad to be rejected, either because they were obviously too early or\r\ntoo late, or because they were only given to the nearest\r\nfive-minutes' interval. There remain 186 observations which are\r\ndivided by Major Dutton into four classes according to their probable\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIn an earthquake of such great duration (about 70 seconds at\r\nCharleston), it is necessary in the first place to select some special\r\nphase of the movement as that to which the records mainly refer, and\r\nthen to determine as accurately as possible the time of occurrence of\r\nthis phase at the origin.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt as to which phase should be chosen. The\r\nshock began with a series of tremors, which passed somewhat abruptly\r\ninto the oscillations that formed the first and stronger maximum.\r\nThese were clearly felt all over the disturbed area, and, as the\r\nbeginning of the first maximum at places near the epicentre and the\r\nbeginning of the shock at distant stations were probably due to the\r\nsame vibrations, this particular phase may be fairly selected as that\r\nto which the time-measurements refer.\r\n\r\nThe time of this phase at the origin can only be ascertained from the\r\ntime at which it reached Charleston, and our knowledge of this depends\r\nchiefly on the evidence of stopped clocks. How unreliable this may be\r\nis well known. Clocks may indeed be stopped at almost any phase of the\r\nmovement; and, whenever stopped clocks can be compared with really\r\ngood personal observations, they almost invariably show a later time.\r\nAt Charleston three good clocks were stopped by the vibrations from\r\nthe Woodstock focus, two of them being in close agreement (p. 121);\r\nand, allowing for a few oscillations before their final arrest, Major\r\nDutton places the time of arrival of the selected phase at Charleston\r\nat 9h. 51m. 12s. P.M. The evidence of these clocks is also supported\r\nby that of other observations, which show that 9.51 was certainly the\r\nnearest minute to the time of arrival, and favour a somewhat later\r\ninstant much more strongly than one a little earlier.\r\n\r\nNow, the distance of Charleston from the Woodstock epicentre is\r\nsixteen miles, and from the corresponding focus (with the calculated\r\nvalue of its depth) twenty miles. A first estimate of the velocity\r\ngives a value of a little more than three miles a second, and the time\r\nat the Woodstock focus may therefore be taken as 9h. 51m. 6s. with a\r\nprobable error of a few seconds.[44]\r\n\r\nProceeding to the observations at a distance, we find them, even after\r\nall rejections, to be very different in value. They were therefore\r\ndivided into groups consisting of observations which are as nearly as\r\npossible homogeneous.\r\n\r\nThe first group contains five records from places between 452 and 645\r\nmiles from the Woodstock epicentre. They give the time to within 15\r\nseconds, obtained from an accurately kept clock, or from a clock or\r\nwatch that was compared with such within a few hours of the\r\nearthquake. The resulting velocity is 3.236 plus or minus .105 miles\r\n(or 5205 plus or minus 168 meters) per second.[45]\r\n\r\nIn the second group there are eleven observations (between distances\r\nof 438 and 770 miles) which satisfy the same conditions as those in\r\nthe first group, except that the time is only given to the nearest\r\nminute or half-minute. The velocity obtained from them is 3.226 plus\r\nor minus .147 miles (or 5192 plus or minus 236 metres) per second.\r\n\r\nThe third group included all but the above records and those obtained\r\nfrom stopped clocks. They are 125 in number (between distances of 80\r\nand 924 miles), but it is uncertain whether they correspond to the\r\nselected phase of the movement, and the errors of the clocks and\r\nwatches used were unknown. They give a mean velocity of 3.013 plus or\r\nminus .027 miles (or 4848 plus or minus 43 metres) per second.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth group, we have the evidence of 45 stopped clocks (at\r\nplaces between 20 and 855 miles), which apparently give a velocity of\r\n2.638 plus or minus .105 miles (or 4245 plus or minus .168 metres) per\r\nsecond. At six places, however, the times indicated by stopped clocks\r\ncan be compared with good personal observations; and these show that\r\nthe time of traverse from the origin obtained from the former is on an\r\naverage 1.28 times the time of traverse obtained from the latter. If a\r\nsimilar correction be made for all the stopped clocks, the corrected\r\nvelocity of the earth-waves would be from 3.17 to 3.23 miles (or 5100\r\nto 5200 metres) per second.\r\n\r\nIn obtaining the mean value of the velocity from all the observations,\r\nthose of the fourth group are omitted, and the weights of the first\r\nthree groups are taken inversely as the squares of the probable\r\nerrors--that is, as 2: 1: 4. The resulting mean velocity is 3.221 plus\r\nor minus .050 miles (or 5184 plus or minus 80 metres) per second; and,\r\nthough it does not follow that all other estimates are erroneous (for\r\nthe velocity may vary with the strength of the earthquake and with\r\nother conditions), it is probable that this result is more nearly\r\naccurate than any other previously obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n_Fissures and Sand-Craters._--In point of size, there was nothing\r\nremarkable about the fissures in the ground produced by the Charleston\r\nearthquake. The largest were only a few hundred yards long, and,\r\nexcept near the river-banks, they rarely exceeded an inch in width.\r\nThey seem, however, to have been unusually abundant; for, within an\r\narea of nearly 600 square miles surrounding the two epicentres, they\r\nwere almost universal, and over a much wider area they still occurred\r\nin great numbers, though with somewhat less continuity.\r\n\r\nFrom many of these fissures water was ejected, carrying with it large\r\nquantities of sand and silt, and so abundantly that every stream-bed,\r\neven though generally dry in summer, was flooded. By the passage of\r\nthe water, some part of the fissures was often enlarged into a round\r\nhole of considerable size, ending in a craterlet at the surface.\r\nCertain belts within the fissured area contained large numbers of\r\nthese craterlets, of all sizes up to twenty feet or more in diameter.\r\nOne near Ten-Mile Hill was twenty-one feet across. In this district,\r\nthey were apparently larger and more numerous than elsewhere; many\r\nacres of ground being covered with sand, which, close to the orifices,\r\nwas two feet or more in depth.\r\n\r\nHere and there, the water was ejected with considerable violence, as\r\nwas manifest from the heights to which it spurted. The testimony of\r\nwitnesses on this point is of course doubtful, for the earthquake\r\noccurred after nightfall, but in a few places the branches and leaves\r\nof trees overhanging the orifices were smirched with sand and mud up\r\nto a height of fifteen or twenty feet.\r\n\r\n_Effects on Human Beings._--It is interesting to notice the behaviour\r\nof different races under the influence of a violent earthquake, and\r\nperhaps no greater contrast could be observed than between the\r\ncalmness exhibited by the Japanese in the presence of disaster and the\r\nwild fear merging into helpless panic that characterised the\r\nresidents, and especially the negroes, of Charleston. \"As we dashed\r\ndown the stairway,\" says a writer already quoted (p. 108), \"and out\r\ninto the street, from every quarter arose the shrieks, the cries of\r\npain and fear, the prayers and wailings of terrified women and\r\nchildren, commingled with the hoarse shouts of excited men.... On\r\nevery side were hurrying forms of men and women, bareheaded, partially\r\ndressed, some almost nude, and all nearly crazed with fear and\r\nexcitement.... A few steps away, under the gas-lamp, a woman lies\r\nprone and motionless on the pavement, with upturned face and\r\noutstretched limbs, and the crowd which has now gathered in the street\r\npasses her by, none pausing to see whether she is alive or dead ... no\r\none knows which way to turn, or where to offer aid; many voices are\r\nspeaking at once, but few heed what is said.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the selfish rush for safety here described and the calm\r\ninterest of the most distant observers, Major Dutton records nearly\r\nevery possible variety of mental effects, the actions resulting from\r\nwhich may be roughly classified as follows:\r\n\r\nA. No persons leave their rooms.\r\n\r\nB. Some persons leave their houses.\r\n\r\nC. Most persons run into the streets, which are full of excited\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nD. People rush wildly for open spaces and remain all night\r\nout-of-doors.\r\n\r\nIn the map of the isoseismal lines (Fig. 25), the dotted curves bound\r\nthe areas in which the effects corresponding to the three highest\r\ndegrees of the above scale were observed. The curve for the first\r\ndegree (A) coincides of course with the isoseismal line of intensity\r\n2.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that there is a certain rough correspondence between\r\nthese curves and the isoseismal lines. The curve D and the isoseismal\r\n8 are close together; in other words, people thought it wiser to camp\r\nout-of-doors for the night if the shock was strong enough to damage\r\nbuildings slightly. The curve C and the isoseismal 6 are similarly\r\nconnected; that is, if the movement made pictures swing, etc., people\r\nrushed into the streets. On the whole, the curve B and the isoseismal\r\n3 roughly coincide, or, if the shock was not strong enough to make\r\ndoors and windows rattle, some persons left their houses and public\r\nmeetings were dispersed.\r\n\r\n_Feeling of Nausea._--A feeling of nausea was experienced by many\r\npersons at the time of the earthquake, somewhat rarely it appears in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the epicentre and even outside the isoseismal 7,\r\nbut more frequently beyond these limits, and perceptible as far as the\r\nbroken line in Fig. 25. The most distant places at which it was\r\nnoticed are Blue Mountain Creek (New York) and Dubuque (Iowa), which\r\nare respectively 823 and 886 miles from Charleston.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER-SHOCKS.\r\n\r\nAs Summerville lies six miles to the north-west of the Woodstock\r\nepicentre and Charleston 16 miles to the south-east, it is probable\r\nthat many of the after-shocks were unfelt and a still greater number\r\nunrecorded. In Charleston, seven shocks, all much slighter than the\r\nprincipal shock, were felt during the night of August 31--September 1,\r\nand thirty before the end of September. Of these, the shock of\r\nSeptember 3rd, at 11 P.M., was the strongest, but those which occurred\r\non September 1st, 2nd, 21st, and 27th were also described as severe,\r\nand the remainder as moderate or slight. For weeks after the great\r\nshock, curious sensations were distinctly perceptible during the still\r\nhours of the night \"as though the crust of the earth were resting on a\r\ngelatinous mass in constant motion.\" The last shock felt in Charleston\r\nseems to have been one recorded on March 18th, 1887.\r\n\r\nAt Summerville, many shocks occurred that were scarcely perceptible in\r\nCharleston, and those noticed in both places were usually stronger,\r\nand the motion more nearly vertical, at Summerville. \"The peculiar\r\ncharacteristic of all of them was the deep, solemn, powerful boom,\r\nlike the report of a heavy cannon, usually accompanied by a quick,\r\nshort jar. Sometimes it was prolonged into a heavy roar or rumble, as\r\nif many reports were delivered in a volley. The number of them was\r\nnever recorded.\" On September 3rd, Mr. W.J. McGee, of the United\r\nStates Geological Survey, arrived at Summerville. During the evening\r\nof that day, detonations were heard at intervals, averaging perhaps\r\nhalf-an-hour, accompanied occasionally by very slight spasmodic\r\ntremors of an instant's duration. They were much like peals of thunder\r\nat a distance of half-a-mile or more, though rather more muffled. \"It\r\nwas my impression,\" Mr. McGee remarks, \"that the sound was sometimes\r\nabout as grave as the ear can perceive, resembling somewhat the\r\ntremulous roar sometimes accompanying combustion in locomotives.\"\r\nThese sounds continued, but with diminishing frequency, throughout the\r\nremainder of the year and as late as July 1st, 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nMajor Dutton's valuable monograph is a record of the\r\nearthquake-phenomena. He offers no theory as to the cause of the\r\nshock, and is therefore in no way responsible for the account given in\r\nthe remaining part of this chapter.\r\n\r\nThat there were two seismic foci he has shown, I think, conclusively;\r\nand my object is now to trace out briefly the probable nature of the\r\nmovements that produced the double shock.\r\n\r\nReferring to Figs. 28 and 29, it will be seen that, according to both\r\nMr. Sloan and Major Dutton, the isoseismals surrounding the Rantowles\r\nepicentre are distorted along a line which runs from a few degrees\r\neast of north to a few degrees west of south. Their oval form is in\r\nall probability connected with a focus elongated in about the same\r\ndirection. Near the Woodstock epicentre, the isoseismals are drawn\r\ndifferently in the two maps, and in neither case do they offer any\r\nsure guide as to the form of the seismic focus. If, however, we follow\r\nMr. Sloan's interpretation of the evidence, and suppose the earthquake\r\nto have been fault-formed, then it is probable that in this region the\r\nfault bends round slightly towards the east.\r\n\r\nThe only other evidence on this point is that afforded by the regions\r\nof defective intensity, real or apparent, along the three\r\nrailway-lines diverging from Charleston. One of these occurred near\r\nMount Holly Station on the North-Eastern Railway (B, Figs. 28 and 29),\r\nanother for four miles starting from the 11-1/2-mile point on the\r\nSouth Carolina Railway (A), and a third along the Charleston and\r\nSavannah Railway (C) over a distance of four miles from the Ashley\r\nRiver. In the first two cases, Major Dutton suggests that the less\r\namount of damage was due to the nature of the soil traversed by the\r\nrailway; but it is on the softer ground that the effects of an\r\nearthquake-shock are generally the more disastrous. On the whole, it\r\nseems to me probable that the three tracts referred to are really\r\nregions of less intensity, and it is worthy of notice that they lie\r\nalong a nearly straight line.\r\n\r\nTo show the bearing of these remarks, let CD (Fig. 32) represent the\r\nsection of a fault and EF that of the surface of the earth, and\r\nsuppose the rock-mass A to slip slightly and suddenly downwards. Then\r\nthe particles of A at the surface of the fault will, by impulsive\r\nfriction, be drawn sharply upwards, and those of B correspondingly\r\ndownwards; so that the earth-waves in the two rock-masses will start\r\nin opposite phases of vibration. Along the line of fault, every\r\nparticle of rock, being urged upwards and downwards almost equally,\r\nwill remain practically at rest. Thus, regions of defective intensity\r\nmay arise from partial interference by the spreading of either\r\nearth-wave in the adjoining rock-mass.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 32.--Diagram to explain origin of regions of\r\n   defective intensity.]\r\n\r\nIf this be the correct explanation, the path of the originating fault\r\nmay be taken as that indicated by the broken line in Fig. 28, a line\r\nwhich is nearly parallel to the chief branches of the isoseismal\r\ncurves.[46] As both epicentres lie on the west side of this line, the\r\nfault must hade or slope in this direction. The distortion of the\r\nWoodstock isoseismals towards the north-west confirms the latter\r\ninference, for the intensity of the shock is greater on the side\r\ntowards which the fault hades.\r\n\r\nFrom the comparative absence of earthquakes in South Carolina, we may\r\ninfer that the fault is one subject to displacements at wide intervals\r\nof time. The gradually increasing stress along its surface was\r\nrelieved at one or two points in or near the Woodstock focus on August\r\n27th and 28th, and perhaps during the preceding months. But the first\r\ngreat slip took place suddenly in that focus, and spread gradually\r\nsouthwards--for there was no interruption in the movement--until about\r\nhalf-a-minute later it reached the Rantowles focus, where the second\r\ngreat slip occurred. Eight or ten minutes afterwards there was another\r\nslip--in what part of the fault is uncertain--and this was followed at\r\nirregular intervals by many small movements gradually diminishing in\r\nfrequency and in focal area. Within a year from the first disturbance,\r\nthe fault-system attained once more its usual condition of rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.\r\n\r\n  1.

Small figures are added along\r\nthe railway lines to denote the distance in miles from the stations in\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\n[41] If this were so, the decrease in intensity would be only\r\napparent; but it may have been real, and a possible explanation on\r\nthis supposition is given later on (p. 135).\r\n\r\n[42] If _c_ be the depth of the focus, _a_ the intensity at unit\r\ndistance from the focus, and _y_ the intensity on the surface at\r\ndistance _x_ from the epicentre, then\r\n\r\ny=a/(c^2+x^2)\r\n\r\nThe inclination of the curve at any point is given by\r\n\r\ndy/dx=-2*a*x/(c^2+x^2)^2,\r\n\r\nand this is a maximum when\r\n\r\nd^2y/dx^2 or (3*x^2-c^2)/(c^2+x^2)^3\r\n\r\nis zero, which is satisfied when c=x*sqrt(3)\r\n\r\n[43] _British Association Report_, 1858, pp. 101-103.\r\n\r\n[44] The above time would have to be increased by one second if the\r\ndepth of the focus were very small, and diminished by one second if it\r\nwere as great as 23 miles; the difference in either case being less\r\nthan the probable error.\r\n\r\n[45] The method employed is as follows: Let t_0 be the computed time\r\n(9h. 51m. 6s.) at the focus, _x_ seconds the error in this estimate,\r\n_t_ the reported time at a given place, _D_ its distance from the\r\nfocus in miles, and _y_ the number of seconds required to travel one\r\nmile; then, assuming that _y_ does not vary with the distance, we have\r\nx+Dy=t+t_0. An equation of this form is obtained from each\r\nobservation, and the method of least squares is then applied to\r\ndetermine the most probable values of _x_ and _y_.\r\n\r\n[46] This seems to me the more probable course. It is possible,\r\nhowever, that the fault-line may pass from Mount Holly Station to the\r\neast of the Woodstock epicentre as shown in Fig. 28, and then to the\r\nwest of the Rantowles epicentre, the fault changing its direction of\r\nhade in the intermediate district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE RIVIERA EARTHQUAKE OF FEBRUARY 23RD, 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew earthquakes have aroused a more widespread interest than those\r\nwhich struck the thronged cities of the Riviera on February 23rd,\r\n1887. The first and greatest of the shocks occurred at about 6.20\r\nA.M., the second nine minutes later, and the third, intermediate in\r\nstrength, at about 8.51 A.M.[47] All three shocks were of destructive\r\nviolence, the damage wrought by them extending along the coast and for\r\na short distance inland from Nice to beyond Savona. Most of the injury\r\nto property and nearly all the loss of life were, however,\r\nconcentrated on the eastern side of the frontier; and it therefore\r\nfell to the lot of the Italian Government to provide for the\r\nscientific investigation of the earthquakes, as well as to meet the\r\nwants of those deprived of home and support. Professors Taramelli and\r\nMercalli, who two years before had studied the earthquakes in\r\nAndalusia, were again nominated, the former to examine the geology of\r\nthe central regions, and the latter to report on the seismic\r\nphenomena. Their joint memoir forms one of the most complete accounts\r\nthat we possess of any earthquake, and is the chief authority for the\r\ndescription given in this chapter. Another valuable monograph is that\r\nprepared by Professor A. Issel, of Genoa, who received an independent\r\nappointment from the same Ministry. A third official commission was\r\nalso sent to estimate the amount of damage caused by the earthquakes\r\nin the Italian towns and villages. In France, the destruction of\r\nproperty was much less serious, and attention was confined chiefly to\r\nthe records of the shock provided by magnetographs and other\r\ninstruments in distant observatories. In Switzerland, the effects\r\nremarked were merely those due to the evanescent vibrations of a\r\nremote earthquake; but many interesting records were collected by the\r\npermanent seismological commission established in that country.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMAGE CAUSED BY THE EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nOwing to variations in the nature, foundation, and site of buildings,\r\nthere is always great diversity in the destructive effects of an\r\nearthquake. In one and the same town, most of the houses may be razed\r\nto the ground, while in their midst may be found some that are\r\nshattered but still standing, and others perhaps that are practically\r\nunharmed. The stronger after-shocks often complete the ruin of the\r\npartially damaged houses; though in such cases the real loss is as a\r\nrule comparatively small.\r\n\r\nThe close succession of the two strong after-shocks of February 23rd\r\nmade it impossible as a rule to separate their effects from those due\r\nto the first shock; but it has been roughly estimated that about\r\none-quarter of the total damage was caused by the two after-shocks\r\ntogether. To them also must be referred in part the comparatively\r\nsmall number of wounded, many persons buried beneath the ruins having\r\nno doubt perished from subsequent falls before they could be\r\nextricated.\r\n\r\nTaking all three shocks together, the total loss to property,\r\naccording to Professor Mercalli, must be valued at about 22 million\r\nfrancs in Italy alone. For the province of the Alpes Maritimes in\r\nFrance, full details are wanting, but the loss there cannot fall far\r\nshort of three million francs. The total amount of damage must\r\ntherefore be placed at about a million pounds. From the figures given\r\nby the official commissions, it appears that the earthquakes were most\r\ndisastrous at Diano Marina and Diano Castello; while other places,\r\nsuch as Oneglia, Bussana, Baiardo, Pompeiana, and Vallecrosia,\r\nsuffered only a little less severely. At Mentone about 155 houses, and\r\nat Nice about 61 houses, were rendered uninhabitable, and many others\r\nwere badly injured.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, 633 persons were killed, 432 seriously wounded, and 104\r\nslightly wounded; in France, 7 persons were killed and 30 seriously\r\nwounded, the number of persons slightly wounded being unknown. The\r\nmajority of the deaths occurred in two or three places. Thus, at Diano\r\nMarina, 190 persons were killed and 102 wounded; at Baiardo, 220 were\r\nkilled and 60 wounded; at Bussana, there were 53 killed and 27\r\nwounded. The death-rates were, however, comparatively small, amounting\r\nfor the above places to not more than 8-1/2, 14, and 6-1/2 per cent.,\r\nrespectively; figures which only slightly exceed those obtained for\r\nplaces in the meizoseismal area of the Andalusian earthquake.\r\n\r\nThough the damage can hardly be regarded as excessive, it was\r\nnevertheless largely due to the peculiar architecture prevalent in the\r\nRiviera. Arches in the walls are common even in the upper storeys,\r\nand, in Oneglia and Diano Marina, if not also in other places, the\r\nfloors are nearly always brick arches abutting against the walls and\r\nwithout other lateral support. Professor Mercalli believes that, in\r\nprivate houses, more than 90 per cent. of the dead bodies were crushed\r\nbeneath these fallen arches. The height of the buildings is also great\r\nin proportion to the foundation and to the thickness of the walls; and\r\nthe main walls are interrupted by numerous apertures, from the corners\r\nof which nearly all the fissures sprang. In some of the coast towns,\r\nthe houses are built of rounded stones gathered from the beach, or of\r\nrubble with stones of all shapes and sizes, bound by cement of the\r\npoorest quality. Lastly, as much of the damage due to previous\r\nearthquakes had been badly repaired, it is evident that the\r\ndestructiveness of the Riviera earthquakes must to a great extent be\r\nreferred to preventable causes.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of the principal shock shortly after six on the morning\r\nof Ash Wednesday must also have increased the death-rate; for many\r\npersons, after a night of amusement, had lain down for a short time\r\nand were sleeping heavily; while others had already risen and were\r\ncollected in the churches; the circumstances in either case rendering\r\nescape more difficult.\r\n\r\nTaking account, however, of this accidental increase in the number of\r\nvictims, Professor Mercalli considers that the earthquake of 1887 was\r\nthe most disastrous of all those which have visited either the\r\nRiviera or northern Italy in the last three centuries; though, during\r\nthe nineteenth century, there were three Italian earthquakes of far\r\ngreater destructive power, but all confined to the southern part of\r\nthe peninsula--namely, the Neapolitan earthquakes of 1805 and 1857,\r\nand the Ischian earthquake of 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR THE EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, as usual, to specify the exact moment when the first\r\nearthquake of the 1887 series took place; but it is evident that the\r\npreparation for the great shock was very brief. At Oneglia, it is\r\nalleged that faint shocks and sounds were observed many times, chiefly\r\nat night, during the month preceding February 23rd; though they were\r\nnot at the time supposed to be of seismic origin. A slight shock is\r\nalso reported from Diano at about midnight on February 21-22.\r\n\r\nThe first undoubted shock occurred on February 22nd, at about 8.30\r\nP.M., or ten hours before the principal earthquake. Though very\r\nslight, it was felt throughout the Riviera and in part of Piedmont.\r\nAnother shock, also weak, took place at about 11 P.M.; and a third,\r\nsensible only in the eastern part of the Ligurian Apennines, on\r\nFebruary 23rd, at about 1 A.M.; at which time the tide-gauge at Genoa\r\nrecorded some abnormal oscillations. An hour later, a more important,\r\nthough by no means a strong, shock occurred; this was perceptible all\r\nover the Riviera, in Piedmont, and in Corsica; in other words, it\r\ndisturbed a region agreeing closely with the central area of the\r\ndisastrous shock. At about 5 A.M., a fifth shock, somewhat weaker\r\nthan the preceding, was felt over the same area, concurrently, or\r\nnearly so, with another abnormal oscillation of the tide-gauge at\r\nGenoa; while a sixth shock was noticed at several places a few minutes\r\nbefore the great shock.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of February 22-23, nervous persons in many towns and\r\nvillages were agitated without apparent reason. Birds and animals,\r\nmore sensitive than human beings to faint tremors, were more\r\ndistinctly affected, especially for some minutes before the\r\nearthquake. Horses refused food, were restless or tried to escape from\r\ntheir stables, dogs howled, birds flew about and uttered cries of\r\nalarm. As these symptoms were noticed at more than one hundred and\r\nthirty places within the Italian part of the central area, there can\r\nbe little doubt that they were caused by microseismic movements for\r\nthe most part insensible to man.\r\n\r\n\r\nISOSEISMAL LINES AND DISTURBED AREA.\r\n\r\nThe only complete map of the isoseismal lines is that drawn by\r\nProfessor Mercalli.[48] In this map, reproduced in Fig. 33, the\r\ncontinuous curves represent the principal isoseismal lines; the dotted\r\ncurves define the disturbed areas of two of the stronger after-shocks.\r\n\r\nThe meizoseismal area, bounded by the curve marked 1 in Fig. 33, is\r\nalso shown on a larger scale in Fig. 34. At the places denoted by\r\nsmall circles in the latter figure, the principal shock was\r\n\"disastrous,\" some of the houses in each being either totally or\r\npartially ruined. At those marked by a small cross, the shock was\r\n\"almost ruinous\"; in other words, numerous houses were damaged, but in\r\nno case was the injury of a serious character. The meizoseismal area\r\nis thus a narrow band, skirting the Riviera coast from Mentone to\r\nAlbissola, a distance of 106 miles, and extending inland for not more\r\nthan from nine to twelve miles. The greatest intensity, corresponding\r\nto the ruin of many houses with considerable loss of life, was\r\nreached at only a few places between Bussano and Diano Marina, all\r\nlying within a littoral band about twenty miles in length and three to\r\nthree and a half miles in width. If, however, the epicentre had lain\r\non land, the area would have been much greater, Professor Mercalli\r\nestimates about four times greater, than its actual amount.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 33.--Isoseismal lines of the Riviera\r\n   earthquake. (_Mercalli._)]\r\n\r\nThe curve marked 2 (Fig. 33) bounds the \"almost ruinous\" zone; its\r\nexpansion towards the north and contraction towards the west,\r\nnorth-west, and east, being its most noteworthy features. The next\r\nzone, that of slight damage, is contained between the isoseismals 2\r\nand 3, the latter curve probably grazing the north end of Corsica.\r\nBeyond this lies the \"strong\" zone, in which the shock was generally\r\nfelt without causing any damage to buildings. Its boundary (marked 4)\r\npasses near Marseilles, Como, and Parma, and includes nearly the whole\r\nof Corsica; towards the north-west, in the valley of Aosta, it curves\r\nin towards the isoseismal 3.\r\n\r\nIn the outermost zone of all the shock was \"slight,\" and towards the\r\nmargin was only just perceptible. The boundary, which of course\r\ndefines that of the disturbed area, reaches as far north as Basle and\r\nDijon, to Perpignan on the west, Trento, Venice, and Pordenone on the\r\neast, and to the south as far as Tivoli (near Rome) and the northern\r\nend of Sardinia. In eastern Switzerland, it shows a marked curve\r\ninwards; possibly, as Professor Mercalli suggests, from the vibrations\r\nhaving to cross the northern Apennines in a direction nearly at right\r\nangles to their axis. Except for this bay, however, the curve differs\r\nlittle from a circle, the centre of which lies in the sea, a little to\r\nthe south of Oneglia, close to the position assigned by other evidence\r\nto the epicentre. The radius of this circle being about 264 miles, it\r\nfollows that the disturbed area must have contained about 219,000\r\nsquare miles--by no means a large amount for so strong an earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE EPICENTRES.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the form of the meizoseismal area shown in Fig.\r\n33, that a mere fringe of it lies upon land, and that the epicentre\r\nmust be situated some distance out at sea. Other facts may be\r\nmentioned which point to the same conclusion. There were, for\r\ninstance, no purely vertical movements observed, even in the districts\r\nwhere the damage done by the shock was greatest. Nor were any large\r\nlandslips to be seen in those areas; there were no lasting changes in\r\nthe underground water-system; and in general, as Professor Mercalli\r\nremarks, all the superficial distortions of the ground which are so\r\ncharacteristic of the epicentral area of a great earthquake were\r\nconspicuous by their absence. There is evidence, again, of some\r\ndisturbance of the sea-bed in the death and flight of fishes from\r\ngreat depths and in the seismic sea-waves recorded by the tide-gauges\r\nat Genoa and Nice. These phenomena will be described in a later\r\nsection, but reference should be made here to an interesting\r\nobservation at Oneglia on the occurrence of some of the stronger\r\nafter-shocks. Persons on the coast, it is said, saw the sea curling\r\nand moving, and immediately afterwards the shock was felt.\r\n\r\nIn determining the position of the epicentre, Professor Mercalli had\r\nrecourse as usual to observations on the direction of the shock,\r\nespecially those derived from the oscillation of lamps or other\r\nsuspended objects, the projection or fall of bodies free to move,\r\nfractures, etc., in damaged houses, and the stopping of pendulum\r\nclocks. Such observations were made at 120 places--72 in the western\r\nRiviera and the Alpes Maritimes, and 48 at Piedmont, Lombardy, and\r\nTuscany.\r\n\r\nAt many of these places the movement was extremely complicated. In\r\nnearly all parts of the area most strongly shaken, for instance, the\r\ndirection of the shock changed more than once; and it was therefore\r\nnecessary to select whenever possible the principal direction of the\r\nshock at each place. In some towns, such as Oneglia, Mentone, Antibes,\r\nCuneo, etc., the shock had two dominant directions, and these appeared\r\nto be sensibly at right angles to one another; an inclination which,\r\nas Professor Mercalli suggests, may be due in part to the\r\napproximation of the real directions to those of the principal walls\r\nof the houses in which the observations were made.\r\n\r\nMost of the lines of direction, when plotted on the map, converge\r\ntowards an area lying between the meridians of Oneglia and San Remo,\r\nand between nine and fifteen miles from the coast. For places near the\r\nepicentre, the most trustworthy, in Mercalli's opinion, are those made\r\nat Oneglia, Mentone, Taggia, Bordighera, Castel Vittorio, Nice, and\r\nGenoa; and the points in which these lines Intersect one another are\r\nIndicated by small crosses on the map of the meizoseismal area (Fig.\r\n34). All of them lie at sea at distances between six and fifteen miles\r\nto the south of Oneglia. The most probable position of the principal\r\nepicentre is that marked by the small circle A, which is situated\r\nabout fifteen miles south of Oneglia.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Meizoseismal area of the Riviera\r\n   earthquake. (_Taramelli and Mercalli._)]\r\n\r\nThere are, however, several lines of direction which can have no\r\nconnection with this epicentre. Besides the east and west lines at\r\nNice, Mentone, and Antibes, there are others at the same places which\r\nrun north and south or nearly so. Professor Mercalli believes that\r\nthey were due to vibrations coming from a second focus lying to the\r\nsouth of Nice, and there are also several lines of direction at more\r\ndistant places which converge towards the neighbourhood of the\r\ncorresponding epicentre.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion receives unexpected support from some of the best\r\ntime-records. At the railway-stations of Loano and Pietra Ligure, the\r\ntimes of occurrence were given as 6h. 20m. 5s. and 6h. 20m.\r\nrespectively--estimates which are probably accurate to within a few\r\nseconds; for, at the moment of the shock, the officer who brought the\r\nexact time along the railway-line from Genoa was at Loana, and had\r\njust passed through Pietra Ligure. On the other hand, the estimates\r\nfor Mentone and Nice--namely, 6h. 18m. 35s. and 6h. 19m. 43s., if not\r\nequally exact, cannot err by many seconds, certainly not by so much as\r\none minute. Since the distances of Loana and Pietra Ligure from the\r\nprincipal epicentre are 31 and 32 miles, and those of Mentone and Nice\r\n28 and 37 miles, it is therefore clear that the vibrations which\r\narrived first at Nice and Mentone must have come from a local focus,\r\nwhere the impulse preceded that at the principal focus by several\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF THE PRINCIPAL FOCUS.\r\n\r\nInaccurate as are all the methods of determining the depth of focus,\r\nit seems probable, as Professor Issel argues, that the principal\r\nRiviera focus was situated at a considerable distance from the\r\nsurface. In no part of the meizoseismal area was the shock a really\r\nviolent one; yet its intensity must have faded very slowly outwards,\r\nfor it was strong enough to stop clocks at places in Switzerland and\r\nelsewhere not less than 250 miles from the origin.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mercalli regards Mallet's method with greater favour than\r\nmost seismologists. He points to the gradual increase in the angle of\r\nemergence from the outer zones disturbed by the Riviera earthquake\r\ntowards the meizoseismal area, where several good observations were\r\nmade from fissures in walls parallel to the dominant direction of the\r\nshock. The angles of emergence which he considers as most trustworthy\r\nare those of 35° at Taggia, 40° at Oneglia, and about 30° at\r\nBordighera. The corresponding depths for the focus are 10.4, 10.4, and\r\n11.6 miles, giving an average of about 10-3/4 miles.\r\n\r\nThere are no similar observations forthcoming for the depth of the\r\nsecondary focus near Nice and Mentone; but Professor Mercalli observes\r\nthat it must have been shallower than the other, for the vertical\r\ncomponent of the vibrations from this focus was much less sensible\r\nthan that of the motion coming from the principal focus.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\n_The Double Shock._--In the valuable collection of records made by\r\nProfessors Taramelli and Mercalli there appears at first sight to be\r\nthe utmost diversity in the evidence with regard to the nature of the\r\nshock. Thus, in the province of P. Maurizio alone, the shock was\r\ndescribed as subsultory first and then undulatory or vorticose at 25\r\nplaces, undulatory and then subsultory at 22, undulatory and then\r\nsubsultory and again undulatory or vorticose at 13, and subsultory\r\nfirst, then undulatory, and finally subsultory and vorticose at two\r\nplaces. It is clear that the shock was of considerable duration, not\r\nless than half-a-minute as a rule, and that there were several phases\r\nin the movement; and it would seem that one or more of these phases\r\nmay have passed unnoticed owing to the alarm occasioned by the shock,\r\nand to the fact that most of the observers were asleep when the\r\nearthquake began. Defects of memory must also have an influence not to\r\nbe neglected, for, even with the simple shocks felt in the British\r\nIsles, persons in the same or neighbouring places differ greatly in\r\ntheir testimony.\r\n\r\nBut, if we confine ourselves to the accounts of careful persons alone,\r\nthe discrepancies to a large extent disappear. Indeed, all over the\r\nruinous area (Fig. 33) the shock maintained a nearly uniform\r\ncharacter. At Oneglia, for instance, there were two well-marked\r\nphases, the first of which began with a brief subsultory movement,\r\nfollowed by more horizontal undulations of longer period; a pause,\r\nlasting but for an instant, was succeeded by vibrations which, though\r\nnot vertical, were highly inclined to the horizon; they continued\r\nthroughout the second phase, but, towards the end, new undulations\r\nwere superposed, and these, coming from different directions, resulted\r\nin an apparently vorticose movement. Professor Mercalli represents the\r\nmotion diagrammatically by the curve _a_ in Fig. 35. At Diano Marina,\r\nas will be seen from the curve _b_, the shock again consisted of two\r\nphases, each beginning with a few subsultory vibrations and ending\r\nwith horizontal undulations of much longer period. In the first phase,\r\nthe undulations were marked by a dominant direction, but, towards the\r\nclose of the second phase, there was no determinate direction, and the\r\nimpression was again that of a vorticose shock. At Savona, the\r\nmovement, which is represented by the curve _c_, must have lasted from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty seconds. It also consisted of two phases, with\r\nsubsultory vibrations and undulations in the same order; and it was\r\nnoticed that the second part of the shock was much stronger than the\r\nfirst. According to some observers, the concluding movements were\r\nvorticose.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 35.--Nature of shock of Riviera earthquake.\r\n   (_Taramelli and Mercalli._)]\r\n\r\nIn the zone surrounding the ruinous area, the vertical component of\r\nthe motion was observed to diminish with the intensity; but, in other\r\nrespects as well as in duration, the shock retained the same general\r\nform. At Genoa, Turin, Acqui, Alessandria, Antibes, and other places,\r\ntwo distinct phases were perceived, occasionally separated by a brief\r\npause, the first being invariably the weaker. At some places, the\r\nobservers speak of two shocks at about 6.20 A.M., separated by an\r\ninterval of a few seconds; and this division was noticeable as far as\r\nSalò on the shore of Lake Garda and Vicenza in Venetia. Only in\r\nSwitzerland and other districts near the boundary of the disturbed\r\narea did the weaker part of the shock become insensible, the other\r\nconsisting of horizontal oscillations, remarkable for their slowness\r\nand regularity, and lasting for as much as twenty or thirty seconds.\r\n\r\nWe may thus conclude, with Professor Mercalli, that the earthquake\r\nresulted from the almost immediate succession of two distinct shocks,\r\nin each of which the nearly vertical vibrations were more marked at\r\nthe beginning, while the slower undulations predominated towards the\r\nclose, those of the second phase generally becoming vorticose through\r\nthe superposition of movements coming from different directions. The\r\nsecond part of the shock in all of the more carefully written accounts\r\nis described as the stronger, especially as regards the subsultory\r\nvibrations in the meizoseismal area; except in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of Nice, where the second phase was generally regarded\r\nas the weaker, or at any rate as not stronger than the first.\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Double Shock._--These observations show, not only that\r\nthe principal earthquake consisted of two distinct shocks, but also\r\nthat the shocks originated in different foci. For, if the vibrations\r\nof both had started from one focus, the second shock would have been\r\neverywhere the stronger; instead of which there was a small area near\r\nNice where the intensity of the first was the greater. This points\r\nclearly to the existence of another focus situated not far from Nice;\r\nand it is evident that the greater intensity of the first part in that\r\ndistrict was due solely to the proximity of this focus, for, still\r\nfarther to the west, at Antibes, the second part was again the\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\nThere is thus a striking agreement in the inferences drawn from\r\nobservations on the direction, time of occurrence, and nature of the\r\nshock. In the face of such concurring testimony, little doubt can\r\nremain as to the existence of two foci, one to the south of Oneglia\r\nand the other to the south of Nice, the initial impulse at the latter\r\nbeing decidedly the weaker, and preceding that at the eastern focus by\r\nan interval of some seconds, long enough at any rate for the resulting\r\nvibrations to reach the Oneglia focus and to spread beyond it before\r\nthe vibrations from that focus started on their outward journey.\r\n\r\n_Seismographic Records._--In 1887, the Riviera and the districts\r\nadjoining it were unprovided with accurately constructed seismographs.\r\nThe observatories at Alessandria, Milan, Monza, Parma, Florence, and\r\nother places in Italy contained seismoscopes and other pendulums, and\r\nthese all registered the fact that an earthquake had occurred, and in\r\nmany cases traced a series of elliptical or elongated curves. A record\r\nof the shock was also given by a Cecchi seismograph at Perpignan in\r\nFrance, but the distance from the epicentre was too great to allow\r\ndetails to be shown. The most valuable record was that obtained from a\r\nCecchi seismograph at the observatory of Moncalieri, near Turin, about\r\nninety miles north of the principal epicentre.\r\n\r\nIn this seismograph, the pendulums are provided with pointers, the\r\ntips of which touch vertical sheets of paper attached to the sides of\r\nan upright rectangular box. When an earthquake occurs, this box is\r\nmade to descend slowly with a uniform velocity, while the moving\r\npointers trace curves upon the smoked paper. The north-and-south\r\ncomponent of the horizontal motion is inscribed on the sheet of paper\r\nfacing west, and the east-and-west component on the paper facing\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 36.--Seismographic record of the Riviera\r\n   earthquake at Moncalieri. (_Denza._)]\r\n\r\nDuring the principal Riviera earthquake, the former pendulum furnished\r\nan indistinct record, while the other traced the diagram reproduced in\r\nFig. 36. The movement, as here represented, began at about 6h. 21m.\r\n50s. A.M. (mean time of Rome) with a series of small tremors, which\r\nlasted for about twelve seconds. Then followed some large\r\noscillations, always in a nearly east-and-west direction, which at 6h.\r\n22m. 21s. gave place to a second series of tremors similar to those at\r\nthe beginning of the shock, but of greater amplitude. These continued\r\nfor at least twelve seconds, at the end of which time the motion of\r\nthe smoked paper ceased. The total duration of the movement at\r\nMoncalieri cannot therefore have been less than forty-three seconds.\r\n\r\nInteresting as this record is, it is doubtful how far it represents\r\naccurately the movement of the ground. The Moncalieri instrument was\r\nerected before the modern type of seismograph was designed, in which\r\nsome part remains steady, or very nearly steady, during the\r\ncomplicated movements of the ground that take place in an earthquake.\r\nIt will be noticed that the curve in Fig. 36 shows no sign of the\r\ndivision of the shock into two distinct parts, and this may perhaps be\r\ndue to the swinging of the pendulum itself; in which case, the curve\r\ndescribed by the pointer would be the resultant of the oscillations of\r\nthe ground and the proper motion of the pendulum.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND-PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\nThe sounds that preceded and accompanied the Riviera earthquake have\r\nattracted but little study, although they seem to have been widely\r\nobserved. No attempt was made to define the limits of the area over\r\nwhich they were audible; but Professor Mercalli states that in the two\r\nouter zones (Fig. 33) the sound generally passed unobserved. It was,\r\nhowever, heard near Piacenza in Lombardy and Reggio in Emilia, places\r\nwhich are about 115 and 140 miles from the principal epicentre.\r\n\r\nIn the area in which the shock was most violent, the sound resembled\r\nthat of trains and vehicles in motion; while, outside this area it\r\ngenerally appeared to be like the hissing of a violent wind. In only a\r\nfew places was it compared to detonations, the crashes of artillery or\r\ndistant thunder. Some observers describe the sound as appearing at\r\nfirst as if a strong wind were rising, and then as the roaring of a\r\nheavy railway-train passing.\r\n\r\nNearly all the observers, who were awake at the beginning of the\r\nearthquake, agree in asserting that the sound distinctly preceded any\r\nmovement of the ground. From this, as in the case of the Andalusian\r\nearthquake, Professor Mercalli infers that the sound-vibrations\r\ntravelled with the greater velocity; but, as will be shown in Chapter\r\nVIII., the general precedence of the sound admits of another and more\r\nprobable explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNFELT EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nIf the Andalusian earthquake first drew general attention to the\r\ndistant spread of unfelt earth-waves, the Riviera earthquake showed\r\nthat this was no isolated phenomenon. We know now that the propagation\r\nof such waves is only limited by the surface of the earth, but in 1887\r\nsome doubt was felt at first as to the nature of the disturbance,\r\nwhether it was magnetic or mechanical in its origin.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, the only observatories at which magnetographs were disturbed\r\nwere those of Lisbon, Parc Saint-Maur (near Paris), Greenwich, and\r\nWilhelmshaven. In 1887, the magnetographs registered the Riviera\r\nearthquake at these and several other observatories, the distribution\r\nof which is shown in Fig. 37. In this sketch-map, the position of the\r\nprincipal epicentre is represented by the small cross, while the\r\nnearly circular line shows the boundary of the disturbed area.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 37.--Distribution of observatories at which\r\n   magnetographs were disturbed by the Riviera earthquake.]\r\n\r\nThree of the observatories, those of Nice, Lyons, and Perpignan, lie\r\ninside this area. At Nice (which is thirty-seven miles from the\r\nprincipal epicentre), M. Perrotin states that the magnetograph curves\r\nshow nothing of any interest, except a notable magnetic perturbation\r\non the vertical force curve, the time of which, however, is not\r\nstated.[49] At Lyons (211 miles), the declination, horizontal force\r\nand vertical force, magnets were all disturbed at 6h. 25m. 47s. A.M.,\r\nand Perpignan (264 miles), all three magnets, but especially those for\r\nthe declination and horizontal force, were set abruptly oscillating\r\nat 6h. 25m. 20s.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in France, the disturbances were noticed at the\r\nobservatories of Parc Saint-Maur and Montsouris, near Paris (about 447\r\nmiles), and at Nantes (538 miles). At Parc Saint-Maur, all three\r\ncurves show a very clear trace of the earthquake at 6h. 25m. 35s., the\r\noscillations lasting several minutes, and at Montsouris they also\r\nbegan at the same time. At Nantes, the perturbations were so slight\r\nthat they escaped notice on a first examination.\r\n\r\nIn Austria, disturbances were observed at Pola (295 miles) and Vienna\r\n(506 miles), beginning at 6h. 28m. 35s. and 6h. 30m. 35s.,\r\nrespectively. They reached Brussels (522 miles) at 6h. 29m. 27s., and\r\nUtrecht (600 miles) at 6h. 28m. 38s.[50] At Wilhelmshaven (690 miles),\r\nonly the vertical force magnet was affected, the oscillations\r\nbeginning at 6h. 30m. 35s., and lasting for fourteen minutes. At 6h.\r\n27m. 55s., the declination and horizontal force magnets of Greenwich\r\nobservatory (642 miles) were set vibrating, but no similar\r\ndisturbances were revealed by the vertical force curve or by the two\r\nearth-current registers. At Kew (652 miles), the horizontal force\r\nmagnetograph was moved by the earthquake at about 6h. 29m. 55s. The\r\ncurves at Stonyhurst and Falmouth show no sign of any disturbance, nor\r\ndo those at Pawlovsk in Russia, or Seville. At Lisbon (951 miles),\r\nhowever, the three curves indicate disturbances at 6h. 32m. 35s., but\r\nso feeble are they that they would have escaped discovery if the\r\noccurrence of the earthquake had been unknown.\r\n\r\nThe effects registered on the magnetograms are quite different from\r\nthose which correspond to ordinary magnetic perturbations; but they\r\nare not unlike those produced by the action of the momentary currents\r\nwhich are used for making the hour-marks, except that the\r\nearthquake-oscillations lasted several minutes (see Fig. 21). In each\r\ncase, then, the magnetic bars must have received a succession of\r\nseveral or many impulses.\r\n\r\nNow, the effect of these impulses on each magnet must depend on the\r\nrelations which exist between the period of oscillation of the magnet,\r\nthe rate of damping of such oscillations, and the interval between the\r\nsuccessive impulses. Also, the apparent commencement of the phenomena\r\nmay be delayed if two impulses of contrary sense should follow one\r\nanother before the bar is perceptibly displaced. It is therefore to be\r\nexpected, as M. Mascart points out, that the disturbances of the three\r\ninstruments need not be of the same order of magnitude, that with\r\ndifferent forms of apparatus the effects may be very variable, and\r\nthat the deflection of one instrument may precede that of another at\r\none and the same place.\r\n\r\nIn all the magnetographs, the record is made on photographic paper,\r\nwhich travels so slowly that the time of a movement can only be\r\nascertained to the nearest minute. As the disturbances on the French\r\ncurves were apparently almost simultaneous, and as no two of the\r\nothers differed in time of occurrence by more than five minutes, there\r\nis thus some colour for M. Mascart's contention that the magnetic\r\napparatus registered, not the movements of the ground, but the passage\r\nof electric currents produced in the ground at a certain epoch of the\r\nearthquake.[51]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is important to notice that, in the central part\r\nof the disturbed area, at Nice, two, if not all three, of the\r\nmagnetographs were unaffected at the time of the earthquake.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, this fact seems equally opposed to a mechanical\r\nexplanation of the disturbance. But, when the vibrations are very\r\nrapid, as they are in the neighbourhood of the epicentre, the magnetic\r\nbars, owing to their mode of suspension, have not sufficient time to\r\nbe sensibly deflected in the brief interval between successive phases\r\nof the impulse. The magnetograms of the Montsouris observatory show,\r\nfor instance, hardly any perceptible trace of disturbance during the\r\npassage of railway trains along two adjacent lines. The farther,\r\nhowever, the earth-waves travel from the origin, the longer becomes\r\nthe period of their vibrations. In Switzerland, they were remarkable\r\nfor their slowness, even to the unaided senses. Thus, at places more\r\nor less remote from the Riviera, the magnets would receive impulses at\r\nintervals approximating to their own periods of vibration, and they\r\nwould then oscillate freely for some time.\r\n\r\nAgain, notwithstanding some variations, it will be remarked that on\r\nthe whole the retardation of the initial epoch of the disturbances\r\nincreases with the distance from the epicentre. It thus seems clear, I\r\nthink, that the cause of the disturbances must be sought in the shock\r\nitself; although their initial epochs at different places are too\r\nroughly defined for ascertaining the velocity with which the\r\nearth-waves travelled.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE EARTHQUAKE AT SEA.\r\n\r\nThe Riviera earthquake, owing to its submarine origin, was marked by\r\ncertain phenomena that were absent from the other earthquakes\r\ndescribed in this volume.\r\n\r\n_Nature of the Earthquake at Sea._--At the time of the earthquake,\r\nseveral vessels were close to the epicentral area. One, about three\r\nmiles off Diano Marina, was shaken twice at about 6.20 A.M., and so\r\nviolently that it seemed as if the masts would be broken off. Another,\r\nabout ten miles south of P. Maurizio, also experienced two shocks, a\r\nfew minutes apart, as if each time it had struck the bottom. These\r\nobservations are chiefly interesting in showing that the double shock\r\nwas felt at sea as well as on land. As transverse vibrations are not\r\npropagated through water, it follows that the second part of the shock\r\ncannot, as some maintain, have been composed of transverse vibrations.\r\n\r\n_Destruction of Fishes._--During the days immediately following the\r\nearthquake, a large number of deep-sea fishes were found dead or\r\nhalf-dead either in shallow water or stranded on the beach, especially\r\nin the neighbourhood of Nice. Among them were numerous specimens,\r\nmostly dead and floating, of _Alepocephalus rostratus_, a typical\r\ndeep-sea form, several of _Pomatomus telescopium_, _Scopelus\r\nelongatus_, and _S. humboldti_, and many of _Dentex macrophthalmus_\r\nand _Spinax niger_. The death and flight of these fishes must have\r\nbeen due to a sudden shock, almost like that caused by the explosion\r\nof dynamite, and communicated simultaneously to the whole surface of\r\ntheir bodies.\r\n\r\n_Seismic Sea-Waves._--Immediately after the earthquake, the sea\r\nretired a short distance, variously estimated at from ten to thirty\r\nmetres, laying bare some rocks that were usually immersed. At P.\r\nMaurizio, the surface was lowered by a little more than a metre; and\r\nafter a few minutes it rose to nearly a metre above its original\r\nlevel, returning to it after a series of continually-decreasing\r\noscillations. At San Remo, a fall of about the same amount took place,\r\nthe sea returning after five minutes, and a ship anchored in the\r\nharbour broke from her moorings. Again, at Antibes, the sea was\r\nsuddenly lowered by about a metre, so that ships afloat in the harbour\r\nwere aground for some instants, and then returned with some\r\nimpetuosity to its original level.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 38.--Record of tide-gauge at Nice.\r\n   (_Issel._)]\r\n\r\nThe evidence of eye-witnesses is confirmed by that of the tide-gauges\r\nat Nice and Genoa, the curves of which are reproduced in Figs. 38 and\r\n39. At Nice, the first arrest of the curve in its usual course\r\noccurred at 6.30 A.M.;[52] the sea-level sank somewhat abruptly, and\r\nafter a few marked oscillations gradually returned to its normal\r\nposition at 7.50 A.M. At Genoa, the shock caused the writing-pen of\r\nthe tide-gauge to dent the paper on which the record is made, and soon\r\nafterwards the curve shows a series of irregular oscillations, about\r\neight taking place every hour, and gradually decreasing until they\r\nceased to be perceptible about two hours after the principal\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 39.--Record of tide-gauge at Genoa.\r\n   (_Issel._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n_Connection between Geological Structure and the Intensity of the\r\nShock._--As with the Andalusian earthquake, faulty construction and\r\ndefective materials were responsible for much of the damage caused by\r\nthe Riviera earthquake. But, if we may judge from the sharp local\r\nvariations in its amount, the nature of the surface-rocks must have\r\nexerted a still more potent influence. At Cervo, for example, the\r\ninjury to property amounted to less than £3 per head of the\r\npopulation; at Diano Marina, only two or three miles to the west, it\r\nrose to £22 per head. The death-rate at Cervo was about one-tenth, and\r\nat Diano Marina about 8-1/2 per cent. Again, at Mentone, the damage\r\nmust have been considerable, for about 155 houses were rendered\r\nuninhabitable; while Monte Carlo, only a few miles farther west,\r\nescaped almost unharmed. Now, Mentone and Diano Marina are for the\r\nmost part built on clay or alluvial deposits, and Monte Carlo on a\r\nfoundation of limestone.\r\n\r\nEven within the limits of a single town, variations no less striking\r\nwere perceptible. In Mentone, the greatest damage occurred to houses\r\nof two storeys built on alluvial soil in the low-lying parts near the\r\nsea and in the valleys. The effect of the foundation in this part was\r\nwell shown in the case of two equally well-built houses not more than\r\n300 yards apart. One in the valley, with doubtful foundations, was\r\nvery much shattered; the other, built on rock, was uninjured. The\r\nlarge hotels, especially those on high ground, suffered least, few of\r\nthem having their main walls seriously damaged. These buildings rise\r\nto heights of from four to six storeys, and of necessity have a firm\r\nand solid foundation.\r\n\r\nProfessors Taramelli and Mercalli have made a careful study of the\r\nsubject of this section. The general conclusions at which they arrive\r\nare that the intensity of the shock was greatest at places built on\r\npliocene conglomerates, beds of clay superposed on compact old rocks,\r\npatches of alluvium, miocene formations of some thickness formed of\r\nrepeated alternations of strata of incoherent marls and limestones or\r\ncompact sandstones, beds of chalk, or somewhat rotten dolomite.\r\n\r\nThe shock was also more destructive on the summits of isolated hills\r\nand ridges and on the steep slopes of mountains. The influence of the\r\nform of the ground was, however, subordinate to that exerted by the\r\nnature of the subsoil. Thus, at Mentone, as we have seen, and also at\r\nNice and Genoa, houses built on rock in elevated positions suffered\r\nmuch less than those situated on the plains below that are composed of\r\nsand and recent alluvium.\r\n\r\n_Observations of the Earthquake in Railway-Tunnels._--Observations\r\nmade in mines at various times and places have proved that an\r\nearthquake is felt less strongly in deep workings, if felt at all,\r\nthan on the surface of the ground. In the railway-tunnels of the\r\nRiviera, as Professor Issel has shown, the same result was established\r\nduring the earthquake of 1887.\r\n\r\nOn the line which runs northward from Genoa to Piedmont, a tunnel more\r\nthan five miles in length pierces the hilly ground between Ponterosso\r\nand Ronco, the greatest thickness of rock above being about a thousand\r\nfeet. At the time of the earthquake, the tunnel was not everywhere\r\nopened out to its full width, and men were at work in different\r\nsections. Outside, the shock was strong enough to damage buildings.\r\nInside, at about 200 yards from the south end, only a feeble shock was\r\nfelt; at 1,350 and 1,625 yards, some bricks were seen to fall from the\r\nfacing, but the shock was not otherwise perceived, and only a few\r\nyards farther nothing unusual was noticed by the men at work.\r\n\r\nAgain, in an unfinished tunnel, about three-quarters of a mile long,\r\nbetween the harbour of Genoa and the eastern railway-station, the\r\nvibrations were very slightly felt. Even in the tunnels traversed by\r\nthe coast railway from Genoa to Nice--that is, in those situated\r\nwithin the meizoseismal area--the shock was either very weak or not\r\nfelt at all, and not one of the tunnels suffered the slightest injury.\r\n\r\nTo men at work inside a long tunnel, the conditions for observing\r\nearthquakes are somewhat imperfect, but these facts, nevertheless,\r\nbring out very clearly the inferior intensity of the shock at some\r\ndepth below the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER-SHOCKS.\r\n\r\nWhile the unfelt earth-waves of the great earthquake were still\r\nwending their way over the zone that surrounds the disturbed area, the\r\ncentral regions were again shaken, at 6.29 A.M., by a shock strong\r\nenough to produce fresh ruins in the stricken towns along the coast.\r\nNearly two and a half hours of quiet followed, broken only by a few\r\nsubterranean rumblings in the central part of the meizoseismal area.\r\nThen, at 8.51 A.M., occurred another shock, short and sharp, and\r\ninferior in strength only to the principal earthquake. Both of these\r\nafter-shocks were felt in Western Switzerland; indeed, they were\r\nperceptible nearly as far as the great shock; the second, however, a\r\nlittle farther than the first, for it alone was noticed at such places\r\nas Vicenza, Forlì, and Florence. The shock at 6.29 was usually\r\ndescribed as long and its vibrations as undulatory only; that at 8.51\r\nas rather subsultory than undulatory and of very brief duration. The\r\nlatter, however, was followed after an interval of a few seconds by\r\nanother shock so weak that it generally passed unobserved. Both shocks\r\nwere preceded by a rumbling sound.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two days, tremors and earth-sounds were frequent in\r\nthe Riviera; once an hour, on an average, the greater part of the\r\nmeizoseismal area was shaken by vibrations more or less slight. But,\r\nbetween one shock and another, at Diano Marina and Alassio, and even\r\nas far as Nice, it only required attention from a careful observer to\r\nperceive an almost continual throbbing of the ground.\r\n\r\nOnly one of these shocks, that of February 24th, at 2.10 A.M., was\r\nstrong enough to cause slight damage to buildings. It disturbed an\r\narea, not exceeded by any of the later shocks, the boundary of which,\r\nshown by the dotted line A in Fig. 33, extends to the north and east\r\nas far as Piacenza and Spezia, while to the west it includes Cannes.\r\nThe centre of the curve so drawn lies on land, but, as the shock was\r\nnot felt in Corsica, there is no evidence as to the southerly\r\nextension of the disturbed area; and it is probable, as Professor\r\nMercalli suggests, that the shock originated in the eastern or Oneglia\r\nfocus of the great earthquake.\r\n\r\nAfter February 25th, slight shocks were felt during the next\r\nfortnight, at the rate of three or four a day, until March 11th, when\r\nthe last after-shock resulting in slight damage occurred at about 3.12\r\nP.M. The boundary of its disturbed area, represented in Fig. 33 by the\r\ndotted line B, passes a little to the east of Savona, and then through\r\nAlessandria, Moncalieri, and Marseilles. The shock, however, was not\r\nobserved in Corsica, so that the exact position of the epicentre is\r\nunknown; but Professor Mercalli believes it to coincide with the\r\nwestern or Nice epicentre of the principal earthquake. At the moment\r\nof the shock, the sea was observed from Alassio to curl and to rise\r\nslightly, while the tide-gauge at Nice, which had traced a continuous\r\ncurve earlier in the day, showed a characteristic notch about 3.7 P.M.\r\n\r\nOf the remaining after-shocks, only two attained any notable degree of\r\nstrength. One, on May 20th at about 8.15 A.M., disturbed an area\r\nnearly concentric with that of the great earthquake, and with a\r\nboundary coinciding nearly with the isoseismal 2 in Fig. 33. Again, on\r\nJuly 17th at 11.30 P.M., occurred a shock felt over an area nearly as\r\nlarge as that disturbed on February 24th at 2.10 A.M., and situated in\r\nthe same part of the country.\r\n\r\nAltogether, during the year following the Riviera earthquake,\r\nProfessor Mercalli records 190 after-shocks, most of them slight or\r\nonly just felt. With the exception of the first two (on February\r\n23rd), none was observed outside the isoseismal 4 of the principal\r\nearthquake (Fig. 33); and, of the rest, only the four whose dates are\r\ngiven above disturbed an area of more than one-eighth of that of the\r\ngreat shock. Some of them, like the shock of March 11th, were stronger\r\nin the western part of the meizoseismal area; but the majority\r\naffected most the eastern portion and seem to be closely associated\r\nwith the Oneglia focus.\r\n\r\nFrom February 26th to April 20th, Professor Rumi made observations on\r\nthe after-shocks by means of the Foucault pendulum erected at Genoa\r\nfor demonstrating the rotation of the earth. In nearly every case, the\r\noscillations took place along a north-east and south-west line, or in\r\nthe same direction as the first great shock--a resemblance which\r\nsupports the inference that many of the after-shocks originated\r\nwithin the Oneglia focus.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n_Recent Movements in the Riviera._--The earliest movements that\r\nresulted in the great range of the Maritime Alps and the Ligurian\r\nApennines date from pre-Carboniferous times, when the central\r\ncrystalline massifs in part emerged. At the end of the Liassic epoch,\r\nthe secondary formations of the district were uplifted, and it was at\r\nthis time that the range assumed its characteristic curved form. Later\r\nstill, at the close of the Eocene period, an elevation of more than\r\n9000 feet took place, for upper Eocene beds are found at this height\r\nin the Maritime Alps.\r\n\r\nSince that time, other important movements have occurred. Pliocene\r\ndeposits have been found in the Riviera at an altitude of 1,800 feet.\r\nRecent soundings in the Gulf of Genoa have also shown that all the\r\nvalleys of the Riviera between Nice and Genoa are continued far below\r\nthe level of the sea to depths of not less than 3000 feet. Thus, at\r\nthe end of the Pliocene or beginning of the Quaternary period, there\r\nwas an elevation of nearly 5000 feet, accompanied or followed by the\r\nerosion of the valleys which, later on, during the Quaternary period,\r\nwere submerged about 3000 feet. Even in still more recent times,\r\nprobably in the Palæolithic age, minor movements continued. Traces of\r\nrecent elevation, varying in amount from a few feet to sixty feet or\r\nmore, occur at the Balzi Rossi in the Alpes Maritimes, near Bergeggi,\r\nand in Genoa; while evidences of submergence are to be found near\r\nMonaco, at Beaulieu and at Diano Marina. It is important to notice\r\nthat the great movements dating from the end of the Eocene period are\r\nalmost confined to the Maritime Alps and the western portion of the\r\nRiviera. In the parts of Piedmont lying to the north of Cuneo and in\r\nthe eastern Riviera, they produced hardly any sensible effect.\r\n\r\n_Seismic History of the Riviera._--The movements just referred to are\r\nthose which, in course of time, have become sensible to the eye. They\r\nrepresent the sum of a long-continued series of displacements that may\r\nonce have been on a large scale, but are now comparatively small. The\r\nearthquakes that occur in the Riviera show, however, that the final\r\nstage has not yet been reached. Their epicentres indicate the regions\r\nin which slips are still taking place, and the magnitude of these\r\nslips is roughly measured by the intensity of the resulting shocks.\r\n\r\nThe map in Fig. 40 is one of a series drawn by Professor Mercalli to\r\nrepresent the distribution of seismic activity in Piedmont and the\r\nRiviera. It corresponds to the period from 1801 to 1895. The whole\r\narea is divided into a number of seismic districts, each of which is\r\ndistinguished by a particular degree of activity. In estimating this\r\nquantity, Professor Mercalli takes intensity as well as frequency into\r\naccount. Thus, the lowest degree, represented by the lightest tint of\r\nshading, corresponds to one or two strong earthquakes with a few\r\nmoderate or slight shocks; the eighth and highest to four or five\r\nruinous or disastrous earthquakes followed by trains of after-shocks.\r\nThe map shows very clearly that, during the last century, the seismic\r\nactivity was greatest in the Maritime Alps and the western\r\nRiviera--that is, in the very districts in which the recent\r\nmountain-making movements have been most conspicuous.[53]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Distribution of seismic activity in the\r\n   Riviera. (_Mercalli._)]\r\n\r\nIn all these districts, Professor Mercalli distinguishes several\r\nwell-marked seismic centres, to each of which he traces the origin of\r\ntwo or more earthquakes. In the districts with which we are at present\r\nconcerned, those of the Alpes Maritimes and the western Riviera, the\r\nmost important centres are situated near Oneglia (in the sea), near\r\nTaggia, in the valleys of the Vesubia and Tinea (near Nice), and in\r\nthe sea to the south of Nice. To the first of these centres belongs\r\nthe disastrous earthquake of February 23rd, 1887, as well as its\r\nafter-shocks on February 24th, May 20th, July 17th, and September 30th\r\nof the same year, also the ruinous earthquakes of 1612 and 1854, and\r\nseveral others of a lesser degree of intensity. All of these were\r\nlongitudinal earthquakes, the axes of their meizoseismal areas being\r\nparallel to the neighbouring mountain-ranges. A few miles to the west\r\nof Oneglia lies the Taggia centre, with which were connected the\r\ndisastrous earthquake of 1831, the violent earthquake of 1874, and\r\nother strong or very strong shocks. These were for the most part\r\ntransversal earthquakes, their axes being perpendicular to those of\r\nthe Oneglia centre.\r\n\r\nSome of the strongest earthquakes in this region originated in a\r\ncentre lying to the north of Nice in the valleys of the Vesubia and\r\nTinea. Among them may be mentioned the ruinous earthquakes of 1494,\r\n1556, 1564, and 1644, and probably also the disastrous earthquake of\r\n1227. A fourth centre, and one of considerable interest, is that which\r\nlies at sea, a short distance to the south of Nice, and nearly along\r\nthe continuation of the valleys above-mentioned. This is the secondary\r\ncentre of the earthquake of 1887, and probably also of that of\r\nDecember 29th, 1554. It is occasionally in action apart from the\r\nOneglia centre, as on November 27th, 1771, June 19th, 1806, and\r\nDecember 21st, 1861; but such shocks, though rather strong, never\r\nreach a high degree of intensity.\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Earthquakes of 1887._--The most important feature in\r\nthe principal earthquake of 1887 is its origination in two distinct\r\nfoci, which are sometimes in action almost simultaneously, but more\r\noften separately. The earthquakes belonging to the two foci differ\r\ngreatly in intensity and number, and the stronger part of the shock in\r\n1887 originated in the focus associated with the more disastrous and\r\nmore frequent earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe existence of two foci would of course give rise to a meizoseismal\r\narea elongated in the direction of the line joining them. It is clear,\r\nhowever, that the Oneglia focus was also extended in the same\r\ndirection; for, in the after-shock of February 24th, the isoseismals\r\ndrawn by Professor Mercalli are parallel to this line; and this was\r\nalso the case in the shock of March 11th. As both foci were under the\r\nsea, it is difficult to locate them with precision; but it seems very\r\nprobable that they occupy portions of a submarine fault that runs\r\nparallel or nearly so to the Apennine axis between the meridians of\r\nOneglia and Nice.\r\n\r\nA brief period of preparation is a characteristic of the Riviera\r\nearthquakes. In 1887, two at least of the preliminary shocks on\r\nFebruary 23rd (those of about 2 and 5 A.M.) originated in the Oneglia\r\nfocus. At 6.20 A.M. the first and weaker movement took place in the\r\nwestern focus; and, a few seconds after the resulting vibrations\r\nreached the eastern focus, the second and greater slip took place\r\nthere. The occurrence of seismic sea-waves is probably evidence of the\r\nformation of a small, though sensible, fault-scarp in the same region.\r\nTo relieve the additional stresses thus brought into action along the\r\nfault-surface, numerous small slips took place in different parts,\r\nsome as far to the west as the Nice focus, but the greater number\r\nprobably within or close to the focus in the neighbourhood of Oneglia.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.\r\n\r\n  1.

M. Offret does not include Nice in his list of\r\nobservatories at which magnetographs were disturbed.\r\n\r\n[50] This is the time given by M. Offret. According to M. Mascart, it\r\nshould be 6h. 25m. 40s.\r\n\r\n[51] In order to test the truth of this explanation, M. Moureaux\r\nsuspended a bar of copper at the Parc Saint-Maur observatory by two\r\nthreads in the same way as the horizontal force-magnet. The direction\r\nof this bar was also registered photographically, and it remained\r\nunmoved during the Verny earthquake of July 12th, 1889, and the\r\nDardanelles earthquake of October 25th, 1889, while one or more of the\r\nmagnets were disturbed. The experiment, however, was ineffective; for,\r\nin order that the magnet may rest in a horizontal position, its centre\r\nof gravity must be at unequal distances from the two points of\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n[52] The hour-marks in Fig. 38 refer to Paris mean time, and those in\r\nFig. 39 to Genoa mean time.\r\n\r\n[53] In the seventeenth century, the maximum seismic activity was\r\nmanifested in the neighbourhood of Nice, and in the eighteenth century\r\nin Piedmont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE JAPANESE EARTHQUAKE OF OCTOBER 28TH, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough several years have elapsed since the occurrence of the\r\ngreatest of Japanese earthquakes, the final report that will embody\r\nthe labours of all its investigators is yet to be written. Several\r\nimportant contributions to it, however, have already been made.\r\nProfessor Koto, in an admirable memoir, has traced the course of the\r\ngreat fault-scarp and discussed the origin of the earthquake;\r\nProfessor Omori, with equal care and thoroughness, has investigated\r\nthe unrivalled series of after-shocks; Mr. Conder studied the damaged\r\nbuildings from an architect's point of view; Professor Tanakadate and\r\nDr. Nagaoka devoted themselves to a re-determination of the magnetic\r\nelements of the central district,[54] while, by the compilation of his\r\ngreat catalogue of Japanese earthquakes during the years 1885-92,\r\nProfessor Milne has provided the materials for a further analysis of\r\nthe minor shocks that preceded and followed the principal earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe part of Japan over which the earthquake was sensibly felt is\r\nshown in Fig. 41. The small black area in the centre is that in which\r\nthe shock was most severe and the principal damage to life and\r\nproperty occurred. The other bands, more or less darkly shaded\r\naccording to the greater or less intensity of the shock, will be\r\nreferred to afterwards. Fig. 45 represents the meizoseismal area on a\r\nlarger scale; and, as the greater part of it lies within the two\r\nprovinces of Mino and Owari, the earthquake is generally known among\r\nthe Japanese themselves as the Mino-Owari earthquake of 1891.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 41.--Sketch-Map of Disturbed Area and\r\n   Isoseismal Lines. (_Masato._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEIZOSEISMAL AREA.\r\n\r\nMore than half of the meizoseismal area occupies a low flat plain of\r\nnot less than 400 square miles in extent. On all sides but the south,\r\nthe plain, which is a continuation of the depression forming the Sea\r\nof Isé, is surrounded by mountain ranges, those to the west, north,\r\nand north-east being built up mainly of Palæozoic rocks, and those on\r\nthe east side of granite. A network of rivers and canals converts what\r\nmight otherwise have been unproductive ground into one of the most\r\nfertile districts in Japan. A great garden, as it has been aptly\r\ntermed, the whole plain is covered with rice-fields, and supports a\r\npopulation of about 787 to the square mile--a density which is\r\nexceeded in only six counties of England. As a rule, the soil is a\r\nloose, incoherent, fine sand, with but little clayey matter; and it\r\nis, no doubt, to its sandy nature that the disastrous effects of the\r\nearthquake were largely due. In the northern half of the district, the\r\nmeizoseismal area is much narrower, and here it crosses a great\r\nmountain-range running from south-west to north-east and separating\r\nthe river-systems of the Japan sea from those of the Pacific. To the\r\nnorth, the meizoseismal area terminates in another plain, in the\r\ncentre of which lies the city of Fukui, where the destructiveness of\r\nthe earthquake was only inferior to that experienced in the provinces\r\nof Mino and Owari. There is also a detached portion of the area lying\r\nto the east of Lake Biwa, but it is uncertain whether the exceptional\r\nintensity there was due to the nature of the ground or to the\r\noccurrence of a secondary or sympathetic earthquake in its immediate\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 42.--General Plan of Geological Structure of\r\n   Meizoseismal Area. (_Koto._)]\r\n\r\nThe general plan of the geological structure of the central district\r\nis represented in Fig. 42. The thick line, partly continuous and\r\npartly broken, shows the course of the great fault, to the growth of\r\nwhich the earthquake chiefly owed its origin; while the thin\r\ncontinuous lines represent the changing direction of strike of the\r\nPalæozoic rocks which surround the Mino-Owari plain, and the\r\narrowheads the direction of the dip. It will be seen that the\r\ndirection of the strike forms an S-shaped curve, and it is clear that\r\nthe present torsion-structure of the district could not have been\r\nproduced without the formation of many fractures at right angles and\r\nparallel to the lines of strike. Professor Koto points out that the\r\nregular and parallel valleys of the rivers Tokuno-yama, Neo, Mugi, and\r\nItatori, indicated by broken lines in Fig. 42, have probably been\r\nexcavated along a series of transverse fractures running from\r\nnorth-west to south-east; while fractures which are parallel to the\r\nline of strike may be responsible for the zigzag course of the\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMAGE CAUSED BY THE EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nThe great earthquake occurred at 6.37 A.M., practically without\r\nwarning, and in a few seconds thousands of houses were levelled with\r\nthe ground. Within the whole meizoseismal area there was hardly a\r\nbuilding left undamaged. The road from Nagoya to Gifu, more than\r\ntwenty miles in length, and formerly bordered by an almost continuous\r\nsuccession of villages, was converted into a narrow lane between two\r\nlong drawn-out banks of _débris_. \"In some streets,\" says Professor\r\nMilne, \"it appeared as if the houses had been pushed down from the\r\nend, and they had fallen like a row of cards.\" Or, again, a mass of\r\nheaped-up rubbish might be passed, \"where sticks and earth and tiles\r\nwere so thoroughly mixed that traces of streets or indications of\r\nbuilding had been entirely lost.\" At Gifu, Ogaki, Kasamatsu, and other\r\ntowns, fires broke out after the earthquake. In Kasamatsu the\r\ndestruction was absolutely complete; nothing was left but a heap of\r\nplaster, mud, tiles, and charred timbers. At Ogaki, not more than\r\nthirty out of 8000 houses remained standing, and these were all much\r\ndamaged. Within the whole district, according to the official returns,\r\n197,530 buildings were entirely destroyed, 78,296 half destroyed, and\r\n5,934 shattered and burnt; while 7,279 persons were killed, and 17,393\r\nwere wounded.\r\n\r\nNext to buildings, the embankments which border the rivers and canals\r\nsuffered the most serious damage, no less than 317 miles of such works\r\nhaving to be repaired. Railway-lines were twisted or bent in many\r\nplaces, the total length demolished being more than ten miles. In\r\ncuttings, twenty feet or more in depth, both rails and sleepers were\r\nunmoved; it was on the plains that the effects of the earthquake were\r\nmost marked. The ground appeared as if piled up into bolster-like\r\nridges between the sleepers, and in many places the sleepers had moved\r\nend-ways. When the line crossed a small depression in the general\r\nlevel of the plain, the whole of the track was bowed, as if the ground\r\nwere permanently compressed at such places. \"Effects of compression,\"\r\nsays Professor Milne, \"were most marked on some of the embankments,\r\nwhich gradually raise the line to the level of the bridges. On some of\r\nthese, the track was bent in and out until it resembled a serpent\r\nwriggling up a slope.... Close to the bridges the embankments had\r\ngenerally disappeared, and the rails and sleepers were hanging in the\r\nair in huge catenaries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nISOSEISMAL LINES AND DISTURBED AREA.\r\n\r\nThe land area disturbed by the earthquake and the different isoseismal\r\nlines are shown in Fig. 41. The \"most severely shaken\" district, that\r\nin which the destruction of buildings and engineering works was\r\nnearly complete, contains an area of 4,286 square miles, or about\r\ntwo-thirds that of Yorkshire. This is indicated on the map by the\r\nblack portion. Outside this lies the \"very severely shaken\" district,\r\n17,325 square miles in area, extending from Kobe on the west to\r\nShizuoka on the east, in which ordinary buildings were destroyed,\r\nwalls fractured, embankments and roads damaged, and bridges broken\r\ndown. The third or \"severely shaken\" district contains 20,183 square\r\nmiles; and in this some walls were cracked, pendulum clocks stopped,\r\nand furniture, crockery, etc., overthrown. Tokio and Yokohama lie just\r\nwithin this area. In the fourth region the shock was \"weak,\" the\r\nmotion being distinctly felt, but not causing people to run\r\nout-of-doors; and in the fifth it was \"slight,\" or just sufficient to\r\nbe felt. These two regions together include an area of 51,976 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThus, the land area disturbed amounts altogether to 93,770 square\r\nmiles--_i.e._, to a little more than the area of Great Britain.\r\nAccording to Professor Omori, the mean radius of propagation was about\r\n323 miles, and the total disturbed area must therefore have been about\r\n330,000 square miles, or nearly four times the area of Great Britain.\r\nConsidering the extraordinary intensity of the shock in the central\r\ndistrict, this can hardly be regarded as an over-estimate.\r\n\r\nThe isoseismal lines shown in Fig. 41 are not to be regarded as drawn\r\nwith great accuracy; for there is no marked separation between the\r\ntests corresponding to the different degrees of the scale of\r\nintensity. The seismographs at Gifu and Nagoya were thrown down\r\nwithin the first few seconds, and failed to record the principal\r\nmotion. But a great number of well-formed stone lanterns and\r\ntombstones were overturned, and, from the dimensions of these,\r\nProfessor Omori calculated the maximum horizontal acceleration\r\nnecessary for overturning them at fifty-nine places within the\r\nmeizoseismal area.[55] At five of these it exceeded 4000 millimetres\r\nper second per second, an acceleration equal to about five-twelfths of\r\nthat due to gravity. Making use of these observations, Professor Omori\r\nhas drawn two isoseismal lines within the central district, which are\r\nshown in Fig. 44. At every point of the curve marked 2, the maximum\r\nacceleration was 2000 millimetres per second per second, and of that\r\nmarked 1, 800 millimetres per second per second. The dotted line\r\nwithin the curve marked 2 represents the boundary of the meizoseismal\r\narea, which, it will be observed, differs slightly from that given by\r\nProfessor Koto (see Fig. 45). The difference, however, is apparently\r\ndue to the standard of intensity adopted, Professor Koto's boundary\r\nagreeing rather closely with the curve marked 2 in Fig. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nLittle has yet been made known with regard to the nature of the shock,\r\nand the published records of the accompanying sound are so rare that\r\nit seems as a rule to have passed unheard. The seismographs at Gifu\r\nand Nagoya registered the first half-dozen vibrations, and were then\r\nburied beneath the fallen buildings. In the following table, the data\r\nfrom these two stations are therefore incomplete:--\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED FROM SEISMOGRAPHIC RECORDS.\r\n\r\n-------------------+------------+----------+----------+---------------\r\n                   |            |          |          | Tokio\r\n                   | Gifu.      | Nagoya.  | Osaka.   | (Imp. Univ.).\r\n-------------------+------------+----------+----------+---------------\r\nMaximum horizontal |            |          |          |\r\nmotion             | > 18 mm.   | > 26 mm. | 30 mm.   | > 35 mm.\r\n                   |            |          |          |\r\nPeriod of ditto    | 2.0 secs.  | 1.3 sec. | 1.0 sec. | 2.0 secs.\r\n                   |            |          |          |\r\nMaximum vertical   |            |          |          |\r\nmotion             | > 11.3 mm. | 6.2 mm.  | 8 mm.    | 9.5 mm.\r\n                   |            |          |          |\r\nPeriod of ditto    | 0.9 sec.   | 1.5 sec. | 1.0 sec. | 2.4 secs.\r\n-------------------+------------+----------+----------+---------------\r\n\r\nIf the period of the principal vibrations were known, the observations\r\nof Professor Omori on the overturning of bodies would enable us to\r\ndetermine the range of motion at different places. For instance, the\r\nmaximum acceleration at Nagoya was found by these observations to be\r\n2,600 millimetres per second per second, and if we take the period of\r\nthe greatest horizontal motion to be the same as that of the initial\r\nvibrations--namely, 1.3 second, the total range (or double amplitude)\r\nwould be 223 millimetres, or 8.8 inches. With the same period, and the\r\nmaximum acceleration observed (at Iwakura and Konaki) of more than\r\n4,300 millimetres per second per second, the total range would be\r\ngreater than 14.5 inches.[56]\r\n\r\nIn the meizoseismal area, many persons saw waves crossing the surface\r\nof the ground. At Akasaka, according to one witness, the waves came\r\ndown the streets in lines, their height being perhaps one foot, and\r\ntheir length between ten and thirty feet. To the north of the same\r\narea, we are told that \"the shoreline rose and fell, and with this\r\nrising and falling the waters receded and advanced.\" Even at Tokio,\r\nwhich is about 175 miles from the epicentre, the tilting of the ground\r\nwas very noticeable. After watching his seismographs for about two\r\nminutes, Professor Milne next observed the water in an adjoining tank,\r\n80 feet long and 28 feet wide, with nearly vertical sides. \"At the\r\ntime it was holding about 17 feet of water, which was running across\r\nits breadth, rising first on one side and then on the other to a\r\nheight of about two feet.\" Still clearer is the evidence of the\r\nseismographs in the same city. Instead of a number of irregular waves,\r\nall the records show a series of clean-cut curves. The heavy masses in\r\nthe horizontal pendulums were tilted instead of remaining as steady\r\npoints. They were not simply swinging, for the period of the\r\nundulations differed from that of the seismograph when set swinging,\r\nand also varied in successive undulations. It was ascertained\r\nafterwards, by measurement with a level, that to produce these\r\ndeflections, the seismograph must have been tilted through an angle of\r\nabout one-third of a degree.\r\n\r\n_Direction of the Shock._--Shortly after the earthquake, Professor\r\nOmori travelled over the meizoseismal area and made a large number of\r\nobservations on the directions in which bodies were overturned, taking\r\ncare to include only those in which the direction of falling would not\r\nbe influenced by the form of the base, such as the cylindrical stone\r\nlanterns so frequently found in Japanese gardens. At some places\r\nthese bodies fell in various directions, at others with considerable\r\nuniformity in one direction. For instance, at Nagoya, out of 200 stone\r\nlanterns with cylindrical stems, 119 fell between west and south, and\r\n36 between east and north; the numbers falling within successive\r\nangles of 15° being represented in Fig. 43. The mean direction of fall\r\nis W. 30° S., coinciding with that in which the majority of the\r\nlanterns were overturned. Similar observations were made at forty-two\r\nother places within and near the meizoseismal area, and the resulting\r\nmean direction for each such place in the Mino-Owari district is shown\r\nby short lines in Fig. 44, the arrow indicating the direction towards\r\nwhich the majority of bodies at a given place were overturned. It will\r\nbe seen from this map that the direction of the earthquake motion was\r\ngenerally at right angles, or nearly so, to that of the neighbouring\r\npart of the meizoseismal zone, and that on both sides of it, the\r\nmajority of overturned bodies at each place fell towards this zone.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Plan of Directions of Fall of Overturned\r\n   Bodies at Nagoya.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Map of Mean Directions of Shock and\r\n   Isoseismal Lines in Central District. (_Omori._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF THE EARTH-WAVES.\r\n\r\nThe times of the great earthquake and of sixteen minor shocks on\r\nOctober 28th and 29th and November 6th were determined at the Central\r\nMeteorological Observatory at Tokio, and at either two or three of the\r\nobservatories of Gifu, Nagoya, and Osaka, each of which is provided\r\nwith a seismograph and chronometer. The after-shocks referred to\r\noriginated near a point about 6 miles west of Gifu, and the difference\r\nbetween the distances of Tokio and Osaka from this point is 89-1/2\r\nmiles, of Tokio and Nagoya 147 miles, and of Tokio and Gifu 165 miles.\r\nThe mean time-intervals between these three pairs of places were 67,\r\n111, and 128 seconds respectively; and these give for the mean\r\nvelocity for each interval 2.1 kilometres (or 1.3 mile) per second.\r\nThus there appears in these cases to be no sensible variation in the\r\nvelocity with the distance from the origin.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, an earthquake of such severity was recorded by\r\nmagnetometers at several distant observatories. Disturbances on the\r\nregisters of Zikawei (China), Mauritius, Utrecht, and Greenwich have\r\nbeen attributed to the Japanese earthquake, but the times at which\r\nthey commenced are too indefinite to allow of any determination of the\r\nsurface-velocity of the earth-waves to great distances from the\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT FAULT-SCARP.\r\n\r\nAs in all disastrous earthquakes, the surface of the ground was\r\nscarred and rent by the shock. From the hillsides great landslips\r\ndescended, filling the valleys with _débris_; and slopes which were\r\nformerly green with forest, after the earthquake looked as if they had\r\nbeen painted yellowish-white. Innumerable fissures cut up the plains,\r\nthe general appearance of the ground, according to Professor Milne,\r\nbeing \"as if gigantic ploughs, each cutting a trench from 3 to 12 feet\r\ndeep, had been dragged up and down the river-banks.\" But by far the\r\nmost remarkable feature of the earthquake was a great rent or fault,\r\nwhich, unlike the fissures just referred to, pursued its course\r\nregardless of valley, plain, or mountain. Although at first sight\r\nquite insignificant in many places, and some time hardly visible to\r\nthe untrained eye, Professor Koto has succeeded in tracing this fault\r\nalong the surface for a distance of forty miles, and he gives good\r\nreasons for believing that its total length must be not less than\r\nseventy miles.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Map of Meizoseismal Area. (_Koto._)]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Ploughshare Appearance of the Fault near\r\n   Fujitani. (_Koto._)]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 47.--The Fault-scarp at Midori. (_Koto._)]\r\n\r\nThe general character of the fault-scarp changes with the surface\r\nfeatures. On flat ground, where the throw is small, it cuts up the\r\nsoft earth into enormous clods, or makes a rounded ridge from one to\r\ntwo feet high, so that it resembles, more than anything else, the\r\npathway of a gigantic mole (Fig. 46). When the throw is\r\nconsiderable--and in one place it reaches from 18 to 20 feet--the\r\nfault-scarp forms a terrace, which from a distance has the appearance\r\nof a railway embankment (Fig. 47). Or, again, where the rent traverses\r\na mountain ridge or a spur of hills, \"it caused extensive landslips,\r\none side of it descending considerably in level, carrying the forest\r\nwith it, but with the trees complicatedly interlocked or prostrate on\r\nthe ground.\"\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 48.--Displacement of Field Divisions by the\r\n   Fault near Nishi-Katabira. (_Koto._)]\r\n\r\nAt its southern end, the fault was seen for the first time crossing a\r\nfield near the village of Katabira. The field was broken into clods of\r\nearth, and swollen up to a height of 5-1/2 yards, while a great\r\nlandslip had descended into it from an adjoining hill. A little\r\nfarther to the north-west, the ground was sharply cut by the fault,\r\nthe north-east side having slightly subsided and at the same time been\r\nshifted horizontally through a distance of 3-1/4 to 4 feet to the\r\nnorth-west Adjoining fields were formerly separated by straight mounds\r\nor ridges running north and south and east and west, and these mounds\r\nwere cut through by the fault and displaced, as shown in Fig. 48. From\r\nthis point the fault runs in a general north-westerly direction, the\r\nnorth-east side being always slightly lowered with respect to the\r\nother and shifted to the north-west. Near Seki it takes a more\r\nwesterly direction, and continues so to a short distance east of\r\nTakatomi, where the north side is lowered by five feet, and moved\r\nabout 1-1/4 feet to the west. At the north end of Takatomi, a village\r\nin which every house was levelled with the ground, the fault is\r\ndouble, and the continuous lowering towards the north has converted a\r\nonce level field into sloping ground. At this point, the small river\r\nToba, flowing south, is partially blocked by the fault-scarp, and an\r\narea of about three-quarters of a square mile, on which two villages\r\nstand, was converted into a deep swamp (Fig. 49), so that, as the\r\nearthquake occurred at the time of the rice-harvest, the farmers were\r\nobliged to cut the grain from boats. After passing Takatomi, the fault\r\nagain turns to the west-north-west, but, the throw being small, it\r\nresembles here the track of an enormous mole. At Uméhara it crosses a\r\ngarden between two persimmon trees, appearing on the hard face of the\r\nground as a mere line; but the trees, which were before in an\r\neast-and-west line, now stand in one running north and south, without\r\nbeing in the least affected by the movement (Fig. 50). From here to\r\nKimbara, where the fault enters the Neo valley, the north side is\r\nalways depressed and shifted westwards by about 6-1/2 feet.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 49.--Map of Swamp formed by stoppage of River\r\n   Toba by Fault-scarp. (_Koto._)]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 50.--Shifting of Trees by fault at Uméhara.\r\n   (_Koto._)]\r\n\r\nIt was in the Neo valley that the supreme efforts of the earthquake\r\nwere manifested. Landslips were so numerous that the greater part of\r\nthe mountain slopes had descended into the valley, the whole\r\nappearance of which had changed. \"Unfamiliar obstacles,\" remarks\r\nProfessor Koto, \"made themselves apparent, and small hills covered\r\nwith forest had come into sight which had not been seen before.\" But\r\nthe ground was not only lowered and shifted by the fault; it was\r\npermanently compressed, plots originally 48 feet in length afterwards\r\nmeasuring only 30 feet. In fact, \"it appears,\" in the words of\r\nProfessor Milne, \"as if the whole Neo valley had become narrower.\"\r\n\r\nA few miles after entering the Neo valley, the throw of the fault\r\nreaches its maximum at Midori. But instead of the relative depression\r\nof the east side, which prevails throughout the rest of the line, that\r\nside is here about 20 feet higher than the other. It is, however,\r\nshifted as usual towards the north, by about 13 feet; and this\r\ndisplacement is rendered especially evident by the abrupt break in the\r\nline of a new road to Gifu (Fig. 47). That the east side has really\r\nrisen is clear, for, a little higher up, the river has changed from a\r\nshallow rapid stream 30 yards wide into a small lake of more than\r\ntwice the width, and so deep that a boatman's pole could not reach the\r\nbottom. At Itasho, about a mile north of Midori, both sides are nearly\r\non the same level, the fault appearing like a mole's track; and seven\r\nmiles farther, at Nagoshima, the east side is relatively depressed by\r\nmore than a yard, and at the same time shifted about 6-1/2 feet to the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 51.--Daily frequency of after-shocks at Gifu\r\n   and Nagoya.]\r\n\r\nAt Nogo, the main Neo valley turns off at right angles to the east,\r\nand the fault continues its course up a side valley, the east side,\r\nwith respect to the other, being continually depressed and shifted\r\ntowards the north. It was traced by Professor Koto through Fujitani\r\n(Fig. 46), where there were many unmistakable evidences of the\r\nviolence of the shock, as far as the eastern shoulder of Haku-san; and\r\nhere, after following the fault for 40 miles, the lateness of the\r\nseason compelled him to return. There can be no doubt, however, that\r\nit runs as far as Minomata; and it is probable, from the linear\r\nextension of the meizoseismal area, that it does not entirely die out\r\nbefore reaching the city of Fukui, 70 miles from its starting-point at\r\nKatabira.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR SHOCKS.\r\n\r\nFor some hours after the earthquake, shocks were so frequent in the\r\nmeizoseismal area that the ground in places hardly ever ceased from\r\ntrembling. Without instrumental aid, detailed record was of course\r\nimpossible; but fortunately the buried seismographs at Gifu and Nagoya\r\nwere uninjured, and in about seven hours both were once more in\r\nworking order. To the energy by which this result was accomplished, we\r\nowe our most valuable registers of the after-shocks of a great\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 52.--Monthly frequency of after-shocks at\r\n   Gifu. (_Omori._)]\r\n\r\nUntil the end of 1893--that is, in little more than two years--the\r\ntotal number of shocks recorded at Gifu was 3,365, and at Nagoya\r\n1,298. None of these approached the principal earthquake in severity.\r\nNevertheless, of the Gifu series, 10 were described as violent and 97\r\nstrong; while of the remainder, 1,808 were weak, 1,041 feeble, and 409\r\nwere sounds alone without any accompanying shock. The slight intensity\r\nof most of the shocks is also evident from the inequality in the\r\nnumbers recorded at Gifu and Nagoya, from which it appears that nearly\r\ntwo-thirds were imperceptible more than about 25 miles from the chief\r\norigin of the shocks. Only 70 of the after-shocks during the first two\r\nyears were registered at Osaka, and not more than 30 at Tokio.\r\n\r\n_Distribution of After-shocks in Time._--The decline in frequency of\r\nthe after-shocks was at first extremely rapid, the numbers recorded at\r\nGifu during the six days after the earthquake being 303, 147, 116, 99,\r\n92, and 81, and at Nagoya 185, 93, 79, 56, 30, and 31; in fact, half\r\nof the shocks up to the end of 1893 occurred by November 23rd at Gifu,\r\nand by November 6th at Nagoya. The daily numbers at these two places\r\nare represented in Fig. 51, in which the crosses correspond to the\r\nnumbers at Gifu, and the dots to those at Nagoya; and the curves drawn\r\nthrough or near the marks represent the average daily number of shocks\r\nfrom October 29th to November 20th. It will be seen that these curves\r\nare hyperbolic in form, the change from very rapid to very gradual\r\ndecline in frequency taking place from five to ten days after the\r\ngreat earthquake. Fig. 52 illustrates the distribution in time of the\r\nafter-shocks at Gifu to the end of 1893, the ordinates in these cases\r\nrepresenting the number of shocks during successive months.[57]\r\n\r\nA similar rapid and then gradual decline in frequency characterises\r\nthe strong and weak shocks recorded at Gifu. Of the ten violent\r\nshocks, only one occurred after the beginning of January 1892; and of\r\nthe 97 strong shocks, only three after April 1892. But at the\r\ncommencement of the series, feeble shocks (_i.e._, shocks that could\r\njust be felt) and earth-sounds without any accompanying movement were\r\ncomparatively rare, and did not become really prominent until two\r\nmonths had elapsed. Of the 308 after-shocks recorded in 1893, none\r\ncould be described as strong, only 10 were weak, while 263 were feeble\r\nshocks and 35 merely earth-sounds.\r\n\r\nThe last two diagrams show at a glance that the decline in frequency\r\nof after-shocks is very far from being uniform. Some of the\r\nfluctuations are due to the occurrence of exceptionally strong shocks,\r\neach of which is followed by its own minor train of after-shocks.[58]\r\nOthers seem to be periodic, and possibly owe their origin to external\r\ncauses unconnected with the earthquake.[59]\r\n\r\n_Method of representing the Distribution of After-shocks in\r\nSpace._--The maps in Figs. 54-57 show the distribution of the\r\nafter-shocks in space during four successive intervals of two months\r\neach. They are founded on Professor Milne's great catalogue of\r\nJapanese earthquakes, which give, among other data, the time of\r\noccurrence and the position of the epicentre for every shock until the\r\nend of 1892. For the latter purpose, the whole country is divided by\r\nnorth-south and east-west lines into numbered rectangles, each\r\none-sixth of a degree in length and breadth; and the position of an\r\nepicentre is denoted by the number of the rectangle in which it\r\noccurs. The area included within the maps is bounded by the parallels\r\n34° 40' and 36° 20' lat. N., and by the meridians 2° 10' and 3° 50'\r\nlong. W. of Tokio, so that ten rectangles adjoin each side of the map.\r\nThe number of epicentres lying within each rectangle having been\r\ncounted, curves are then drawn through the centres of all rectangles\r\ncontaining the same number of epicentres, or through points which\r\ndivide the line joining the centres of two rectangles in the proper\r\nproportion. Taking, for example, the curve marked 5, if the numbers in\r\ntwo consecutive rectangles are 3 and 7, the curve bisects the line\r\njoining their centres; if the numbers are 1 and 6, the line joining\r\ntheir centres is divided into five equal parts, and the curve passes\r\nthrough the first point of division reckoned from the centre of the\r\nrectangle in which six epicentres are found. Thus the meaning of the\r\ncurve marked, say, 5 may be stated as follows:--If any point in the\r\ncurve be imagined as the centre of a rectangle whose sides are\r\ndirected north-south and east-west, and are respectively one-sixth of\r\na degree of latitude and longitude in length; then the number of\r\nepicentres within this rectangle is at the rate of 5 for the time\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n_Preparation for the Great Earthquake._--At first sight, there appears\r\nto have been but little direct preparation for the great earthquake.\r\nExcept for a rather strong shock on October 25th, at 9.14 P.M., it\r\noccurred without the warning of any preliminary tremors. But a closer\r\nexamination of the evidence shows, as we should indeed expect, that\r\nthere was a distinct increase in activity for many months beforehand.\r\nThe region had become \"seismically sensitive.\" Of the hundred\r\nrectangles included in the maps in Figs. 53-57, there are thirteen\r\nlying along the meizoseismal area of the earthquake of 1891, in which\r\nnearly all the after-shocks originated. During the five years 1885-89,\r\n53 out of 125 earthquakes (or 42 per cent.) had their epicentres lying\r\nwithin the thirteen rectangles; or, in other words, the average\r\nfrequency in one of the rectangles of the meizoseismal area was five\r\ntimes as great as in one of those outside it. In 1890 and 1891 (until\r\nOctober 27th), the percentage in the thirteen rectangles rose to 61,\r\nand the average frequency in one of them to ten times that of one of\r\nthe exterior rectangles.\r\n\r\nThe curves in Fig. 53 illustrate the distribution of epicentres during\r\nthe latter interval. It will be seen that they follow roughly the\r\ncourse of the meizoseismal area southwards to the Sea of Isé, and that\r\nto the south-east they continue for several miles the short branch of\r\nthe meizoseismal area which surrounds the southern end of the\r\nfault-scarp.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 53.--Distribution of preliminary Shocks in\r\n   Space. (_Davison._)]\r\n\r\nThus, the preparation for the great earthquake is shown, first, by the\r\nincreased frequency of earthquakes originating within its meizoseismal\r\narea; and, secondly, by the uniformity in the distribution of\r\nepicentres throughout the same region, the marked concentration of\r\neffort which characterises the after-shocks being hardly perceptible\r\nduring the years 1890-91.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 54.--Distribution of After-shocks in Space\r\n   (November-December 1891). (_Davison_).]\r\n\r\n_Distribution of After-shocks in Space._--We have seen that the\r\nafter-shocks were subject to a fluctuating decline in frequency, rapid\r\nat first, and more gradual afterwards. It is evident, from Figs.\r\n54-57, that a similar law governs the area within which the\r\nafter-shocks originated. During the first two months, epicentres occur\r\nover nearly the whole of the meizoseismal area, but afterwards they\r\nare confined to a smaller district, which slowly, though not\r\ncontinually, decreases in size.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 55.--Distribution of After-shocks in Space\r\n   (January-February, 1892). (_Davison._)]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 56.--Distribution of After-shocks in Space\r\n   (March-April). (_Davison._)]\r\n\r\nThe most important feature in the distribution of the epicentres is\r\nthe central region of extraordinary activity; but there are also\r\ndistricts of minor and more short-lived activity near the three\r\nextremities of the meizoseismal band. The seat of chief seismic action\r\nshifts slightly from one part to another of the epicentral region,\r\nespecially about the end of 1891, as will be seen by comparing the\r\ninnermost curves of Figs. 54 and 55. Thus, with the decline in\r\nfrequency of the after-shocks and the decrease in their sphere of\r\naction, there took place concurrently a gradual but oscillating\r\nwithdrawal of that action to a more or less central region of the\r\nfault.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 57.--Distribution of After-shocks in Space\r\n   (May-June, 1892). (_Davison._)]\r\n\r\n_Sound Phenomena of After-shocks._--While comparatively few observers\r\nseem to have noticed any noise with the principal earthquake, many of\r\nthe after-shocks were accompanied by sounds. Professor Omori describes\r\nthem as belonging to two types. They were either rushing feeble noises\r\nlike that of wind, or loud rumbling noises like those of thunder, the\r\ndischarge of a gun, or the fall of a heavy body. In the Neo valley,\r\nsounds of the second type were most frequent and distinct, but they\r\neither occurred without any shock at all, or the attendant tremor was\r\nvery feeble; while, on the other hand, severe sharp shocks were\r\ngenerally unaccompanied by distinctly audible sounds.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, also, that sounds were less frequently heard with\r\nthe early than with the later after-shocks. In November 1891, the\r\npercentage of audible shocks was 17, and from December to the\r\nfollowing April always lay between 10 and 12. In May the percentage\r\nsuddenly rose to 39, and until the end of 1892 was always greater than\r\n32, while in November 1892, it rose as high as 49. This, of course,\r\nagrees with Professor Omori's observation that sounds attended feeble\r\nshocks more often than strong ones.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the audible after-shocks in space is shown in Fig.\r\n58. These curves are drawn in the same way as those in Figs. 53-57,\r\nbut they represent the percentages, not the actual numbers, of shocks\r\naccompanied by sound. It will be noticed that all three groups of\r\ncurves lie along the meizoseismal area, or the continuation of the\r\nsouth-east branch; while the axis of the principal group of curves\r\nlies to the west of the central regions in which most after-shocks\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 58.--Distribution of Audible After-shocks in\r\n   Space (November 1891-December 1892). (_Davison_.)]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these peculiarities is no doubt connected with the\r\ncomparative inability of the Japanese people to perceive the deep\r\nsounds which in Europe are always heard with earthquake shocks. The\r\nsounds are rarely heard by them more than a few miles from the\r\nepicentre.[60] We may therefore conclude that slight after-shocks\r\noriginated nearer the surface than strong ones, that the mean depth\r\nof the foci decreased with the lapse of time, and that the axes of the\r\nsystems of curves in Fig. 58 mark out approximately the lines of the\r\ngrowing faults. The separation of the two westerly groups of curves\r\nappears to show that the main branch of the meizoseismal area is\r\nconnected with a fault roughly parallel to that traced by Professor\r\nKoto, but of which no scarp (if it existed) could be readily\r\ndistinguished among the superficial fissures produced by the great\r\nshock.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF THE EARTHQUAKE ON THE SEISMIC ACTIVITY OF THE ADJOINING\r\nDISTRICTS.\r\n\r\nSo great and sudden a displacement as occurred along the fault-scarp\r\ncould hardly take place without affecting the stability of adjoining\r\nregions of the earth's crust, and we should naturally expect to find a\r\ndistinct change in their seismic activity shortly after October 28th.\r\nIn Fig. 59 two such regions are shown, bounded by the straight dotted\r\nlines. The district in which the principal earthquake and its\r\nafter-shocks originated is enclosed within the undulating dotted\r\nlines. The continuous lines inside all three districts are the curves\r\ncorresponding to 10 and 5 epicentres for the years 1885-92. Not far\r\nfrom the axes of the outer groups of curves there are probably\r\ntransverse faults, approximately parallel to the great fault-scarp and\r\nthe main branch of the meizoseismal band, and distant from them about\r\n45 and 55 miles respectively.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 59.--Map of Adjoining Regions in which\r\n   Seismic Activity was affected by the Great Earthquake.\r\n   (_Davison._)]\r\n\r\nIn the district represented in the north-east corner of Fig. 59, 29\r\nearthquakes originated between January 1st, 1885, and October 27th,\r\n1891, and 30 between October 28th, 1891, and December 31st, 1892, 7 of\r\nthe latter number occurring in November 1891. In the south-west\r\ndistrict, the corresponding figures before and after the earthquake\r\nare 20 and 36, 8 of the latter occurring in November 1891. Thus, in\r\nthe north-east district, for every shock in the interval before the\r\nearthquake there were six in an equal time afterwards, and at the rate\r\nof 10 during November 1891; and in the south-west district, for every\r\nshock before the earthquake there were 10 afterwards, and at the rate\r\nof 16 during November 1891.\r\n\r\nNow, it is unlikely that the gradual increase of stress should be so\r\nnearly proportioned everywhere to the prevailing conditions of\r\nresistance as to give rise to a marked and practically simultaneous\r\nchange in seismic activity over a large area; whereas the paroxysmal\r\noccurrence of a strong earthquake might alter the surrounding\r\nconditions with comparative rapidity, and so induce a state of seismic\r\nexcitement in the neighbourhood. It therefore seems very probable\r\nthat the increased activity in the two districts here described was a\r\ndirect consequence of the occurrence of the great earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of preliminary earthquakes within the meizoseismal\r\narea and the outlining of the fault-system by the frequency curves of\r\n1890-91 (Fig. 53) point to the previous existence of the originating\r\nfault or faults, and to the earthquake being due, not to the formation\r\nof a new fracture, as has been suggested, but to the growth of an old\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nThe last severe earthquake in the Mino-Owari plain occurred in 1859,\r\nso that for more than thirty years there had been but little relief to\r\nthe gradually increasing stresses. Now, the distribution of stress\r\nmust have been far from uniform throughout the fault-system, and also\r\nthe resistance to displacement far from proportional to the stresses\r\nat different places. At certain points, therefore, the effective\r\nstress would be greater than elsewhere, and it would be at these\r\npoints that fault-slips would first occur. Such slips tend to remove\r\nthe inequalities in effective stress. Thus, the function of the slight\r\nshocks of 1890 and 1891 was, briefly, to equalise the effective stress\r\nover the whole fault-system, and so to clear the way for one or more\r\ngreat slips throughout its entire length.\r\n\r\nAs to which side of the fault moved during the great displacement, or\r\nwhether both sides moved at once, we have no direct evidence but as\r\nregards the neighbourhood of Midori, and there the conditions were\r\nexceptional. Professor Koto thinks that it was probably the rock on\r\nthe north-east side that was generally depressed and always shifted to\r\nthe north-west But the disturbance in reality seems to have been more\r\ncomplicated. That this was the case, that displacement occurred along\r\nmore than one fault, is probable from the branching of the\r\nmeizoseismal area, the isolation of the audibility curves of the\r\nafter-shocks (Fig. 58), and the sudden increase in seismic activity\r\nboth to the north-east and south-west of the epicentre. The detached\r\nportion of the meizoseismal area near Lake Biwa may also point to a\r\nseparate focus. The whole region, indeed, was evidently subjected to\r\nintense stresses, and the depression on the north-east side of the\r\nfault-scarp can hardly fail to have been accompanied by other\r\nmovements, especially along a fault running near the western margin of\r\nthe main branch of the meizoseismal area.\r\n\r\nThe later stages of the movements are somewhat clearer. From a study\r\nof the after-shocks, we learn that the disturbed masses began at once\r\nto settle back towards the position of equilibrium. At first the slips\r\nwere numerous and took place over the whole fault-system, but chiefly\r\nat a considerable depth, where no doubt the initial displacement was\r\ngreatest. After a few months, stability was nearly restored along the\r\nextremities of the faults; slips were confined almost entirely to the\r\ncentral regions, while a much larger proportion of them took place\r\nwithin the superficial portions of the faults.\r\n\r\nThe official records bring down the history to the end of 1893. Since\r\nthat time more than one strong shock has been felt in the Mino-Owari\r\nplain; but the stage of recovery from the disturbances of 1891 is\r\nprobably near its end, and we seem rather to be entering on a period\r\nin which the forces are once more silently gathering that sooner or\r\nlater will result in another great catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.\r\n\r\n  1.

It is interesting to notice that, taking account of the\r\nmean annual frequency of earthquakes in ordinary years, the number of\r\nshocks observed at Gifu during the two years 1898-99 should, according\r\nto the latter formula, be 163; the actual number recorded was 160.\r\n\r\n[58] The last violent shock before the end of 1893 occurred on\r\nSeptember 7th, 1892, and its effects on the frequency of after-shocks\r\nis shown by the daily numbers recorded at Gifu during the first\r\nfortnight in September. These are--2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 28 (on September\r\n7th), 8, 8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 3.\r\n\r\n[59] The periodicity of after-shocks is discussed in the papers\r\nnumbered 4, 12, 16, and 17 at the end of this chapter. In these, the\r\nexistence of diurnal and other periods is clearly established.\r\nProfessor Omori also shows that the mean daily barometric pressure is\r\nsubject to fluctuations with maxima occurring on an average every\r\n5-1/2 days, and that earthquakes are least frequent on the days of the\r\nbarometric maxima and minima, and more frequent in the days\r\nimmediately preceding and following them.\r\n\r\n[60] Of the Japanese earthquakes of 1885-92 originating beneath the\r\nland, twenty-six per cent. were accompanied by a recorded sound; but\r\nless than one per cent. of those originating beneath the sea and not\r\nmore than ten miles from the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE HEREFORD EARTHQUAKE OF DECEMBER 17TH, 1896, AND THE INVERNESS\r\nEARTHQUAKE OF SEPTEMBER 18TH, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the earthquakes described in this volume, the Hereford and\r\nInverness earthquakes hold but a minor place. The damage to buildings,\r\nthough unusual for this country, was slight when compared with that\r\ncaused by the preceding shocks; there was no loss of life, not a\r\nsingle person was injured by falling masonry. The interest of the\r\nearthquakes lies entirely in the detailed study rendered possible by\r\nnumerous observations of the shock and sound,[61] and in the bearing\r\nof this evidence on the general theory of the origin of earthquakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEREFORD EARTHQUAKE OF DECEMBER 17TH, 1896.\r\n\r\nThe principal earthquake of this series occurred at 5.32 A.M. on\r\nDecember 17th, and was preceded by at least nine minor shocks (the\r\nfirst of which was felt at about 11 or 11.30 P.M. on December 16th),\r\nand followed by two others on the same day, and by a third and last on\r\nJuly 19th, 1897. The accounts of these preliminary movements will be\r\nfound on a later page, as their bearing will be more fully apparent\r\nafter the discussion of the principal shock.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 60.--Isoseismal and Isacoustic lines of\r\n   Hereford earthquake. (_Davison._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nISOSEISMAL LINES AND DISTURBED AREA.\r\n\r\nOn the map in Fig. 60, the continuous curves represent isoseismal\r\nlines corresponding to the degrees 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4 of the\r\nRossi-Forel scale. The isoseismal 8, which is the most accurately\r\ndrawn of the series, is an elongated oval, 40 miles long, 23 miles\r\nbroad, and containing an area of 724 square miles. The longer axis is\r\ndirected W. 44° N. and E. 44° S. Within this curve, there are 73\r\nplaces where buildings are known to have been damaged, 55 places being\r\nin Herefordshire, 17 in Gloucestershire, and one in Worcestershire.\r\n\r\nThe most important damage occurred in the city of Hereford, which, in\r\n1901, contained 4,565 inhabited houses. Here, no fewer than 218\r\nchimneys had to be repaired or rebuilt. The Cathedral was slightly\r\ninjured. The finial of a pinnacle of the Lady Chapel was thrown down,\r\na fragment of a stone fell from one of the arches in the south\r\ntransept, and the three pinnacles of the western front were fractured.\r\nSeveral churches suffered to a similar extent, while, at the Midland\r\nRailway Station, all the seven chimney-stacks were shattered. At\r\nDinedor, Fownhope, Dormington, Withington, and a few other villages,\r\nthe damage was also relatively greater than elsewhere, these places\r\nall lying within a small oval about 8-1/2 miles long, which surrounds,\r\nnot the centre, but rather the north-west focus, of the isoseismal 8.\r\n\r\nThe isoseismal 7, which includes places where the shock was strong\r\nenough to overthrow ornaments, vases, etc., is also very nearly an\r\nellipse, whose axes are 80 and 56 miles in length, and whose area is\r\n3,580 square miles. Its longer axis, running from W. 42° N. to E. 42°\r\nS., is practically parallel to that of the inner curve. Next in\r\nsuccession comes the isoseismal 6, surrounding those places where the\r\nshock was strong enough to make chandeliers, pictures, etc., swing;\r\nbut, as most of the observers seem to have slept in darkened rooms,\r\nthe number of determining points for this curve is less than usual,\r\nand its course is therefore laid down with a somewhat inferior degree\r\nof accuracy. The error, however, is probably small, and we may\r\ntherefore regard the isoseismal 6 as another ellipse, 141 miles long,\r\n116 miles broad, and containing an area of 13,000 square miles. Its\r\nlonger axis is again nearly parallel to those of the preceding\r\nisoseismals.\r\n\r\nThe next two isoseismals are nearly circular in form. It will be\r\nnoticed that large portions of them, and especially of the isoseismal\r\n4, traverse the sea. In these parts, the paths of the curves are to\r\nsome extent conjectural. In drawing them, the chief guides are their\r\ntrend before leaving the land and the known intensity along the\r\nneighbouring coastlines. The isoseismal 5 bounds the area within which\r\nthe shock was perceptible as a sensible displacement and not merely a\r\nquiver. Its dimensions are 233 miles from north-west to south-east,\r\nand 229 miles from south-west to north-east, and its area 41,160\r\nsquare miles. The isoseismal 4, which includes places where the shock\r\nwas strong enough to make doors, windows, etc., rattle, is 356 miles\r\nfrom north-west to south-east, and 357 miles from south-west to\r\nnorth-east, and 98,000 square miles in area; its centre coincides\r\nnearly with that of the small oval area in the neighbourhood of\r\nHereford, where the damage to buildings was relatively greater than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nOutside the isoseismal 4, the earthquake was observed at several\r\nplaces. The shock was certainly felt at Middlesbrough, 12-1/2 miles\r\nfrom the curve, and probably at Killeshandra (in Ireland), 65 miles\r\ndistant. Thus, if we consider the boundary of the disturbed area to\r\ncoincide with the isoseismal 4, its area would be 98,000 square\r\nmiles, or 1-2/3 that of England and Wales; if it were a circle\r\nconcentric with the isoseismal 4, and passing through Middlesbrough,\r\nits area would be 115,000 square miles, or nearly twice that of\r\nEngland and Wales; while, if it passed through Killeshandra, its area\r\nwould be 185,000 square miles, or more than three times the area of\r\nEngland and Wales.[62]\r\n\r\n_Position of the Originating Fault._--The form, directions, and\r\nrelative positions of the isoseismal lines furnish important evidence\r\nwith regard to the originating fault. We conclude in the first place\r\nthat its mean direction is parallel to the longer axes of the three\r\ninnermost isoseismal lines--that is, north-west and south-east, or,\r\nmore accurately, W. 43° N. and E. 43° S.[63] In this case, the\r\nelongated forms of the isoseismal lines cannot be attributed to\r\nvariations in the nature of the surface rocks. The district embraced\r\ncontains about 13,000 square miles, and it is improbable that the axes\r\nof the three isoseismals should retain their parallelism over so large\r\nan area, if these variations had any considerable effect. Moreover, in\r\nthe same district, an earthquake occurred in 1863, whose meizoseismal\r\narea was elongated from north-east to south-west, or almost exactly\r\nperpendicular to the direction in 1896.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it will be noticed (Fig. 60) that the isoseismal lines are\r\nnot equidistant from one another. On the north-east side, they are\r\nseparated by distances of 20, 34, 55, and 51 miles; and on the\r\nsouth-west side by distances of 13-1/4, 25, 60, and 77 miles. It\r\nfollows from this that the fault-surface must hade or slope towards\r\nthe north-east; for, near the epicentre, the intensity is greatest and\r\ndies out more slowly on the side towards which the fault hades.\r\n\r\nIf we could ascertain any one place through which the fault passed,\r\nits position would thus be completely determined. Unfortunately, there\r\nis no decisive evidence on this point. There are, however, several\r\nplaces to the south-west of Hereford where the intensity of the shock\r\nwas distinctly less than in the surrounding district, and it is\r\npossible that this was due to their neighbourhood to the fault-line\r\n(see p. 135). If so, the originating fault must have extended from a\r\npoint about a mile and a half west of Hereford for a distance of about\r\n16 miles to the south-east; and a fault in this position would\r\ncertainly satisfy all the details of the seismic evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nThroughout the disturbed area, considerable variations were observed\r\nin the nature of the shock. These changes were due to the mere size of\r\nthe focus, to its elongated form and, as will be seen, to its\r\ndiscontinuity, and also to the distance of the place of observation\r\nfrom the epicentre.\r\n\r\nAt places near the epicentre, rapid changes in the direction of the\r\nshock were observed owing to the large angle subtended by the focus;\r\nwhile, at considerable distances, this angle being small, the changes\r\nof direction were imperceptible. A further variation with the distance\r\nwas an increase in the period of the vibrations. Close to the\r\nepicentre, the general impression was that of crossing the wake of a\r\nsteamer in a very short rowing-boat, or of riding in a carriage\r\nwithout springs. At distances of a hundred miles or more, the movement\r\nis described as being of a pleasant, gentle, undulating character,\r\nlike that felt during the rocking of a ship at anchor or in a carriage\r\nwith well-appointed springs.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature of the shock, however, was its division\r\ninto two distinct parts or series of vibrations, separated by an\r\ninterval, lasting two or three seconds, of absolute rest and quiet.\r\nAnd this was no mere local phenomenon. With the exception of a narrow\r\nband that will be referred to presently, records of the double shock\r\ncome from nearly all parts of the disturbed area, even from districts\r\nso remote as the Isle of Man and the east of Ireland. The two parts\r\ndiffered in intensity, in duration, and in the period of their\r\nconstituent vibrations. For instance, at Oaklands (near Chard), a\r\nshivering motion was first felt, and then, after about three or four\r\nseconds, a distinct rocking from side to side. At Exeter, there was a\r\nsudden tremor lasting about two seconds, followed, after two or three\r\nseconds, by another and more severe shaking lasting four or five\r\nseconds. Again, at West Cross (near Swansea), an undulatory movement\r\nfor about four seconds was followed soon after by a tremulous shock.\r\nAt Liverpool, the durations of the first part, interval, and second\r\npart were respectively estimated at about six, two, and four seconds.\r\n\r\nAs a first result of the observations, then, it appears that in the\r\nsouth-east half of the disturbed area, the second part of the shock\r\nwas the stronger, of greater duration and consisted of longer-period\r\nvibrations (as at _a_, Fig. 61); while, in the north-west half, the\r\nsame features characterised the first part of the shock (_b_, Fig.\r\n61). A closer examination of the records shows, however, that the\r\nboundary between the two portions of the disturbed area was not a\r\nstraight line, but slightly curved, the concavity facing the\r\nsouth-east. The broken line on the map (Fig. 60), which is hyperbolic\r\nin form, represents roughly the position of this curved boundary.[64]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 61.--Nature of shock of Hereford earthquake.]\r\n\r\nAlong this hyperbolic boundary-line, or rather within a narrow band of\r\nwhich it is the central line, the shock lost its double character, and\r\nwas manifested as a single series of vibrations gradually increasing\r\nin intensity and then dying away. Close to the edges of this band,\r\ncareful observers were able to distinguish two maxima of intensity\r\nconnected by a continuous series of tremors (_c_, Fig. 61). Thus,\r\nwithin the band, the two series of vibrations, which elsewhere were\r\nisolated, must have been superposed on one another; while, near the\r\nedges of the band, the concluding tremors of the first series\r\noverlapped the initial tremors of the second.\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Double Series of Vibrations._--The Hereford earthquake\r\nthus belongs to the same class as the Neapolitan, Andalusian,\r\nCharleston, and Riviera earthquakes. As in these cases, the hypothesis\r\nof a single focus is inadmissible. The division of the disturbed area\r\ninto two regions of opposite relative intensity, duration, etc., is\r\nsufficient proof that a single series of vibrations was not duplicated\r\nby reflection or refraction, or by separation into longitudinal and\r\ntransverse waves. It is equally conclusive against a repetition of the\r\nimpulse within the same focus. We must therefore infer that the focus\r\nconsisted of two nearly or quite detached portions arranged along a\r\nnorth-west and south-east line, and that the impulse at the north-west\r\nfocus was the stronger of the two. The only question that remains to\r\nbe decided is whether the impulses at the two foci were simultaneous\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nNow, if the impulses occurred at the same instant, the waves from the\r\ntwo foci would travel with the same velocity, and would therefore\r\ncoalesce along a straight band which would bisect at right angles the\r\nline joining the two epicentres. But we have already seen that this\r\nband is curved, and it thus follows that the two impulses were not\r\nsimultaneous. Again, since the concavity of the hyperbolic band faces\r\nthe south-east, the waves from the north-west focus must have\r\ntravelled farther than those from the south-east focus before the two\r\nmet along the hyperbolic band; in other words, the impulse at the\r\nnorth-west focus must have occurred two or three seconds before the\r\nimpulse at the other.\r\n\r\n_Position and Dimensions of the Two Foci._--There can be little doubt\r\nthat the impulse at the north-west focus was responsible for the\r\ngreater damage to buildings at Hereford, Dinedor, Fownhope, etc. The\r\ncentre of its epicentral area must therefore lie about three miles\r\nsouth-east of Hereford. It is probable, also, that the corresponding\r\ncentre of the other focus is similarly placed with respect to the\r\nsouth-east portion of the isoseismal 8--that is, about two or three\r\nmiles north-east of Ross. These two points are eight or nine miles\r\napart. Now, since, as we shall see, the mean surface-velocity of the\r\nearth-waves was about 3000 feet per second, and the mean duration of\r\nthe quiet interval between the two series was 3-1/2 seconds, the\r\nnearest ends of the two foci must have been separated by a distance of\r\nnot less than two miles. Moreover, since the series of vibrations from\r\nthe north-west or Hereford focus lasted a few seconds longer than that\r\nfrom the south-east or Ross focus, the former must have been about two\r\nmiles longer than the latter, and we may therefore estimate their\r\nlengths at about eight and six miles respectively. Including the\r\nundisturbed intermediate portion, this would give a total length of\r\nfocus of about 16 miles, a result we have already inferred from the\r\ndimensions of the isoseismal 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTION OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nAlthough no question was asked with regard to the direction of the\r\nshock, no fewer than 469 observers made notes on this point. As a\r\ngeneral rule, their determinations are extremely rough, few referring\r\nto more than the eight principal points of the compass. Moreover, in\r\nany one place, the directions assigned to the shock are very varied.\r\nFor instance, in the city and suburbs of Birmingham, eight observers\r\ngive the direction along a north and south line, eight east and west,\r\neleven north-west and south-east, and five north-east and south-west,\r\nwhile there are five other intermediate estimates. But, when these\r\ndirections are plotted on a map of the district, it is seen at once\r\nthat they are either nearly parallel or perpendicular to the roads in\r\nwhich the observers were living; that is, the apparent direction of\r\nthe shock was at right angles to one of the principal walls of the\r\nhouse. This, of course, is a result to be anticipated, for, whatever\r\nbe the direction of the earthquake-motion, a house tends to oscillate\r\nin a plane perpendicular to one or other of its walls.\r\n\r\nIt is extraordinary to how great a distance the direction of the shock\r\nis perceptible. Records come from Brighton (137 miles from the\r\nepicentre), Maldon in Essex (144 miles), Harrogate (147 miles),\r\nDouglas in the Isle of Man (167 miles), Dublin (176 miles), and\r\nBaltinglass in Co. Wicklow (180 miles).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, whatever the distance may be, the sense of direction\r\nmust be most perceptible in those houses whose principal walls are at\r\nright angles to the true direction of the earthquake-motion, and we\r\nshould therefore expect to find the observations of direction most\r\nfrequently made in such houses, or in others which approximate to this\r\nsituation. Thus, the average of all the observations within a fairly\r\nsmall area should give a result not very far from the true direction\r\nof the shock; and, the smaller the area and the farther from the\r\nepicentre, the more reliable should be the result. Now, in Birmingham\r\nthe mean direction of the shock is E. 39° N., which differs only by 2°\r\nfrom the line joining the city to the epicentre; in London it is E.\r\n21° S., the difference being again 2°. In other cases, the\r\nobservations from different counties are grouped together, and the\r\nmean direction is taken to correspond to the centre of the county.\r\nYet, even then, there is often a close agreement between the mean\r\ndirection of the shock and the direction of the county-centre from the\r\nepicentre; the difference being not more than two or three degrees in\r\nthe counties of Buckingham, Devon, Stafford, Warwick, and York. In\r\nother cases, where the deviation exceeds this amount, either the\r\nnumber of observations is small or the county is near the epicentre\r\nand so subtends a large angle.\r\n\r\nTwo results of some importance follow from this analysis: (1) that\r\nwhile, with a few isolated observations, the \"method of directions\" is\r\nalmost sure to fail, with a large number of observations closely\r\ngrouped, the position of the epicentre may be determined with a fair\r\napproach to accuracy; and (2) that, at any rate outside a radius of\r\nforty miles, the earth-waves travelled in approximately straight lines\r\noutwards from the epicentre.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSEISMAL LINES AND VELOCITY OF EARTH-WAVES.\r\n\r\nCoseismal lines were defined by Mallet as long ago as 1849, but, owing\r\nto the difficulty of ascertaining the correct time, they have so far\r\nbeen of little service in the investigation of earthquakes. In the\r\ncase of the Hereford earthquake, the distances traversed by the\r\nearth-waves are small; but, on the other hand, the time-records are\r\nnumerous and frequently trustworthy to the nearest minute. Rejecting\r\nall estimates earlier than 5.32 A.M., and later than 5.36, as well as\r\na number at 5.35, there remain fairly good observations from 381\r\nplaces, and exceptionally accurate ones from 33 places. The latter\r\nwere obtained from signalmen and other careful observers who were in\r\npossession of Greenwich time, or who compared their watches shortly\r\nafterwards with well-regulated watches.\r\n\r\nWith evidence so abundant, a new method of drawing coseismal lines\r\nbecomes possible. According to this method, each place of observation\r\nis indicated on the map by a mark corresponding to the particular\r\nminute recorded. If the records were quite correct, there would be a\r\ncentral area occupied by the marks corresponding to 5.32 A.M.,\r\nsurrounded by a series of zones in which the times were respectively\r\n5.33, 5.34, and 5.35. The curves separating these zones would be\r\ncoseismal lines corresponding to the times 5.32-1/2, 5.33-1/2, and\r\n5.34-1/2.\r\n\r\nOwing, however, to the inevitable inaccuracy of all the time-records,\r\nthese different zones intrude on one another, and the coseismal lines\r\nhave therefore to be drawn about half-way through the overlapping\r\nregions, special weight being attributed to the apparently more\r\naccurate observations.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 62.--Coseismal lines of the Hereford\r\n   earthquake. (_Davison._)]\r\n\r\nThe coseismal lines obtained in this manner are represented by the\r\ncontinuous curves in Fig. 62. The isoseismals, which are added for the\r\nsake of comparison, are indicated by the dotted lines. It will be seen\r\nthat the coseismal lines are elongated in the same direction as the\r\nisoseismals, but to a less extent, and this no doubt is due to the\r\nfact that the epoch selected by the majority of observers was one not\r\nfar from, and slightly preceding, that of the maximum intensity of\r\nthe shock.\r\n\r\nNow, the average distance between the two inner coseismals is 32-3/4\r\nmiles, between the two outer ones (so far as drawn) 35-1/6 miles, and\r\nbetween the first and third 67-1/6 miles. The mean surface-velocity\r\nbetween the two inner coseismals is therefore 2,882 feet per second,\r\nand between the two outer ones 3,095 feet per second. There is thus an\r\napparent increase in the velocity with the distance, but the accuracy\r\nof the coseismal lines is unequal to establishing this as a fact. The\r\nmean surface-velocity of 2,955 feet per second between the first and\r\nthird coseismals is probably, however, the most accurate estimate of\r\nthe surface-velocity yet made in a slight earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND-PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n_Nature of the Sound._--The sound which accompanied the shock was of\r\nthe same character as that heard during all great earthquakes. It is\r\noften described in such terms as a deep booming noise, a dull heavy\r\nrumble, a grating roaring noise, or a deep groan or moan; more rarely\r\nas a rustling or a loud hissing rushing sound. As a rule, it began\r\nfaintly, increased gradually in strength, and then as gradually died\r\naway; and this no doubt is the reason why it sometimes appeared as if\r\nan underground train or waggon were approaching quickly, rushing\r\nbeneath the observer, and then receding in the opposite direction.\r\nOccasionally, the sound was very loud, being compared to the noise of\r\nmany traction-engines heavily laden passing close at hand, or to a\r\nheavy crash or peal of thunder. But its chief characteristic was its\r\nextraordinary depth, as if it were almost too low to be heard.\r\nAccording to one observer, it was a low rumbling sound, much lower\r\nthan the lowest thunder; and another compared it to the pedal notes of\r\na great organ, only of a deeper pitch than can be taken in by the\r\nhuman ear, a noise more _felt_ than heard. It will be seen presently\r\nhow the sound, from its very depth, was inaudible to many persons.\r\n\r\nA few observers described the sound in terms like those quoted above,\r\nbut by far the larger number compared it to some more or less\r\nwell-known type, and in many cases the resemblance was so close that\r\nthe observer at first attributed it to the object of comparison. The\r\ndescriptions, which present great varieties in detail, may be\r\nclassified as follows: (1) One or several traction-engines passing,\r\neither alone or heavily laden, sometimes driven furiously past; a\r\nsteam-roller passing over frozen ground or at a quicker pace than\r\nusual; heavy waggons driven over stone paving, on a hard or frosty\r\nroad, in a covered way or narrow street, or over hollow ground or a\r\nbridge; express or heavy goods trains rushing through a tunnel or deep\r\ncutting, crossing a wooden bridge or iron viaduct, or a heavy train\r\nrunning on snow; the grating of a vessel over rocks, or the rolling of\r\na lawn by an extremely heavy roller; (2) a loud clap or heavy peal of\r\nthunder, sometimes dull, muffled or subdued, but most often distant\r\nthunder; (3) a moaning, roaring, or rough, strong wind; the rising of\r\nthe wind, a heavy wind pressing against the house; the howling of wind\r\nin a chimney, a chimney or oil-factory on fire; (4) the tipping of a\r\nload of coal, stones, or bricks, a wall or roof falling, or the crash\r\nof a chimney through the roof; (5) the fall of a heavy weight or tree,\r\nthe banging of a door, only more muffled, and the blow of a wave on\r\nthe sea-shore; (6) the explosion of a boiler or cartridge of dynamite,\r\na distant colliery explosion, distant heavy rock-blasting and the boom\r\nof a distant cannon; (7) sounds of a miscellaneous character, such as\r\nthe trampling of many men or animals, an immense covey of partridges\r\non the wing, the roar of a waterfall, the passage of a party of\r\nskaters, and the rending and settling together of huge masses of rock.\r\n\r\nThe total number of comparisons made was 1,264. Of these, 45.4 per\r\ncent. refer to passing waggons, etc., 15.0 per cent. to thunder, 15.5\r\nto wind, 3.9 to loads of stones falling, 2.7 to the fall of a heavy\r\nbody, 7.2 to explosions, and 10.3 per cent. to miscellaneous sounds.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the sound adhered throughout to one of the types mentioned\r\nabove, and, if it varied at all, varied only in intensity. At some\r\nplaces, however, the character of the sound was observed to change.\r\nFor instance, one person described it as like the rumbling of a train\r\ngoing over a bridge, with a terrific crash, such as is heard in a\r\nthunderstorm at the instant when the shock was strongest, the rumbling\r\ndying away afterwards for some seconds.\r\n\r\n_Inaudibility of the Sound to some Observers._--The total number of\r\nobservers who give a detailed account of the earthquake is 2,681, and,\r\nof these, 59 per cent. state that they heard the sound, 23 per cent.\r\ngive no information, while 18 per cent. distinctly say that they\r\nheard no sound; that is, roughly, out of every five observers, three\r\nheard the sound, one made no reference to it, and one failed to hear\r\nthe sound.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases, no doubt, this failure was due to the distance of the\r\nobserver, but this is far from being a complete explanation; for, in\r\nHerefordshire, six out of 179, and in Gloucestershire 17 out of 227,\r\nobservers heard no sound. Nor is the peculiarity a local one, for at\r\nClifton two out of five observers who were awake did not hear the\r\nsound, at Birmingham four out of 23, and in London, eight out of 18.\r\nEven in the same house, it would happen that one observer would hear a\r\nsound as of a heavily-laden traction-engine passing, while to another\r\nit was quite inaudible.\r\n\r\nAgain, a large number of observers who heard the sound expressly state\r\nthat they were unconscious of any while the shock lasted. The noise at\r\nfirst resembled the approach of a steam-roller or traction-engine up\r\nthe street, it became gradually louder, and then ceased more or less\r\nsuddenly as the shock began; while, to others in the same places, the\r\nsound continued to grow in loudness until the strongest vibrations\r\nwere felt.\r\n\r\nEven when observers in the same place agreed in hearing the sound, it\r\npresented itself to them under different aspects. Thus, at Hereford, a\r\ncrash or bomb-like explosion was noticed by some, but not by all,\r\nobservers; at Ledbury, the sound according to one began like a rushing\r\nwind and culminated in a loud explosive report, another heard a noise\r\nlike distant thunder, which ended when the shock began, while a third\r\nheard no sound at all. At places more distant from the epicentre, the\r\nsame diversity, both in character and intensity, is manifested. Thus,\r\nat Birmingham, the accounts refer on the one hand to the distant\r\napproach of a train and the rising of the wind, on the other to the\r\nreports of large cannons and to a noise as if tons of _débris_ had\r\nbeen hurled against the wall of the house; at Bangor, to muffled\r\nthunder, wind through trees, and a loud rumbling sound.\r\n\r\nThe first explanation of these apparent anomalies which presents\r\nitself is inattention on the part of the observers; but it is one that\r\nwill not bear examination, though it may apply in some cases. The\r\nsound is too loud, at any rate near the epicentre, to escape notice,\r\nand it is generally heard before the shock begins to be felt.\r\nMoreover, as described in the last chapter, three out of every four\r\nearthquakes in Japan are unaccompanied by recorded sound, and the\r\nJapanese as a race cannot be accused of such constant inattention. The\r\ndefect, it can hardly be doubted, is inherent to the observer, and not\r\ndependent on the conditions in which he is placed.\r\n\r\nThat the higher limit of audibility varies with different persons has\r\nlong been known; and there can be no reason for doubting that there is\r\na similar variability in the lower limit. Thus, to some observers, the\r\nsound remains inaudible throughout, however intently they may be\r\nlistening. Again, it is found that, the deeper the sound, the greater\r\nmust be the strength of the vibrations required to render them\r\naudible. As the vibrations which reach an observer increase in period,\r\nit may therefore happen that, sooner or later, the strength of some\r\ndoes not attain or exceed that limiting value, and, at that moment,\r\nthe sound will cease to be heard. Moreover, for vibrations of a given\r\nperiod, this limiting value varies for different persons. Thus, to one\r\nobserver, the sound may become inaudible, while another may continue\r\nto hear it. Lastly, the vibrations which affect an observer at any\r\nmoment are of various strength and period. One may hear all perhaps,\r\nwhile a second may be able to hear some and not others. Thus, to one\r\nobserver, the sound may be like a rising wind, to another like a heavy\r\ntraction-engine passing; one may hear the crashes which accompanied\r\nthe strongest part of the shock, while a second may be deaf to the\r\nsame vibrations; to one the sound may become continually louder and\r\ncease abruptly, to another it may increase to a maximum and then die\r\naway.\r\n\r\n_Sound-Area._--While the sound was a very prominent feature of the\r\nearthquake in and near the epicentral area, records at a great\r\ndistance are naturally difficult to obtain, and, on this account, the\r\nnumber of stations for determining the boundary of the sound-area is\r\ntoo small to allow of it being accurately drawn. As a rule, however,\r\nit must lie between the isoseismals 5 and 4, but it is less nearly\r\ncircular than either of these lines. Its length, from north-west to\r\nsouth-east, is 320 miles, its breadth 284 miles, and the area\r\ncontained by it about 70,000 square miles, or roughly two-thirds that\r\nof the disturbed area.\r\n\r\n_Isacoustic Lines._--The dotted lines in Fig. 60 represent isacoustic\r\nlines--that is, lines which pass through all places where the\r\npercentage of observers who recorded their perception of the sound is\r\nthe same. For instance, if we take any point in the line marked 80 and\r\ndescribe a small circle with that point as centre, then 80 per cent.\r\nof the observers within that circle would hear the earthquake-sound.\r\nThe isacoustic lines thus show how the audibility of the sound varies\r\nthroughout the sound area. To draw the curves with a close approach to\r\naccuracy, the unit of area should be small and of constant dimensions;\r\nbut, in the present case, owing to the comparative paucity of the\r\nobservations, a smaller unit than the county would give unreliable\r\nresults.[65] At the centre of each county, the sound audibility may be\r\nregarded as proportional to the percentage of the total number of\r\nobservers within the county who distinctly heard the sound. To draw\r\nthe curve marked 50, the centre of every county in which the average\r\npercentage is less than 50 is joined to the centres of those adjoining\r\ncounties in which it is above 50, and these lines are then divided in\r\nthe proper ratio so as to give a point where the percentage would be\r\nexactly 50. A number of points at which the percentage is 50 is thus\r\nobtained, and the curve drawn through them is the required isacoustic\r\nline. The percentage of audibility varies from 87 in Herefordshire to\r\n23 in Essex and the east of Ireland, but the only isacoustic lines\r\nwhich can be completely drawn are those that correspond to the\r\npercentages between 80 and 50 inclusive.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar form of the isacoustic lines will be evident at a glance.\r\nThey bear little relation to the isoseismal lines. Their greatest\r\nextensions are not along the axes of those lines, but in two\r\ndirections which are a little east of north-east and south of\r\nsouth-west. They lie indeed along a hyberbolic line which, towards\r\nthe south-west, agrees closely with the curvilinear axis of the\r\nhyperbolic band represented by the broken line in Fig. 60. Towards the\r\nnorth-east, the coincidence is not so close, but this is chiefly owing\r\nto the magnitude of the northern counties, which causes a deflection\r\nof the isacoustic lines towards the north.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the hyperbolic band is the area within\r\nwhich the vibrations from the two foci were superposed. Now, the sound\r\naccompanied each part of the shock, and ceased entirely during the\r\ninterval between them. Also, the stronger series of vibrations was\r\naccompanied by the louder sound; but, while the difference in strength\r\nwas considerable between the two parts of the shock, it was very\r\nslight between the two sounds. There is therefore no marked distortion\r\nof the isoseismal lines when crossing the hyperbolic band, while the\r\nisacoustic lines are completely diverted from their normal course.\r\n\r\nThus, the study of the isacoustic lines strongly confirms the\r\nconclusions at which we have arrived above (p. 223)--namely, that\r\nthere were two distinct foci arranged in a north-west and south-east\r\nline, and that the impulse at the former focus occurred a few seconds\r\nearlier than that at the latter.[66]\r\n\r\n_Variations in the Nature of the Sound throughout the Sound-area._--In\r\none respect, the sound exhibited a marked uniformity all over the\r\nsound-area--namely, in its great depth; the word \"heavy\" being used in\r\none out of every four accounts of the sound, whether close to the\r\nepicentre or near the boundary of the sound-area.\r\n\r\nThe type of comparison employed varies in different parts of the\r\nsound-area. As we recede from the origin, the sound becomes on the\r\naverage less like thunder or explosions and more like wind. The\r\nreferences to passing waggons, etc., are so numerous that it is\r\npossible to draw curves, in the same way as isacoustic lines, which\r\nrepresent equal percentages of comparison to this type out of the\r\ntotal number of comparisons. The curves are somewhat incomplete, but\r\nit is noteworthy that those corresponding to the higher percentages\r\ncling to the extremities of the hyperbolic band, probably because the\r\nuninterrupted duration of the sound is greater there than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe effect of distance from the epicentre, however, is most noticeable\r\nin connection with changes in the character of the sound. It is only\r\non the immediate neighbourhood of the origin that the explosive\r\nreports or crashes were heard in the midst of the rumbling sound. At a\r\nmoderate distance, the sound before and after the shock became\r\nsmoother, while the sound which accompanied the shock retained to a\r\ncertain extent its rougher and more rumbling or grating character.\r\nClose to the boundary of the sound-area, the irregularities were still\r\nfurther smoothed away, and the only sound heard was like the low roll\r\nof distant thunder.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these changes depends on the fact that, as we\r\nrecede from the epicentre, the vibrations of every period tend to\r\nbecome inaudible. The limiting vibrations of the whole series will be\r\nthe first to be lost, especially those of the longest period. Thus,\r\nnear the epicentre, sound-vibrations of many different periods will be\r\nheard, and the sound will be more complex than it is elsewhere. The\r\ngreater the distance, the narrower are the limits with regard to\r\nperiod between which the audible vibrations lie, until, near the\r\nboundary of the sound-area, the sound becomes an almost monotonous\r\ndeep growl of nearly uniform intensity.\r\n\r\n_Time-relations of the Sound and Shock._--The principal epochs to be\r\ncompared are the beginning, the epoch of maximum intensity, and the\r\nend. The beginning of the sound preceded that of the shock in 82 per\r\ncent. of the observations on this epoch, coincided with it in 12, and\r\nfollowed it in 6 per cent.; the epoch of maximum intensity preceded\r\nthat of the shock in 21 per cent. of the records, coincided with it in\r\n73, and followed it in 6 per cent.; while the end of the sound\r\npreceded that of the shock in 22-1/2 per cent., coincided with it in\r\n27-1/2, and followed it in 50 per cent. Thus, as a general rule, the\r\nbeginning of the sound preceded that of the shock, the sound was\r\nloudest when the shock was strongest, and the end of the sound\r\nfollowed that of the shock. In other words, the duration of the sound\r\nwas in most cases greater than that of the shock.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nOf the twelve undoubted minor earthquakes, nine occurred before, and\r\nthree after, the principal shock, the times of the first eleven lying\r\nbetween limits about seven hours apart. With three exceptions, the\r\nrecords are insufficient to determine the positions of the epicentre\r\nwith any approach to exactness.\r\n\r\nThe first occurred at about 11 or 11.30 P.M. on December 16th. The\r\nboundary of the disturbed area, which coincides nearly with that of\r\nthe fifth shock (E, Fig. 63), is 97 miles long from north-west to\r\nsouth-east, 83 miles wide, and contains about 6,300 square miles. The\r\nfocus was apparently situated between the two foci of the principal\r\nearthquake and partly coincided with them.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 63.--Map of minor shocks of Hereford\r\n   earthquake. (_Davison._)]\r\n\r\nThen came three slight shocks (at about 1 A.M. on December 17th, 1.30\r\nor 1.45 A.M., and 2 A.M.), about which little is known except that\r\nthey probably originated somewhere near the Ross focus.\r\n\r\nThe fifth shock (E, Fig. 63) occurred at about 3 A.M., and disturbed\r\nan area 104 miles in length, 79 miles in width, and about 6,400 square\r\nmiles in area. Its boundary occupies approximately the position that\r\nwould be taken by an isoseismal of intensity between 7 and 6 of the\r\nprincipal earthquake. We may therefore infer that this shock and the\r\nprincipal earthquake were caused by slips along the same fault and in\r\nabout the same region of the fault. Also, as there is no evidence of\r\ndiscontinuity in the vibrations of the minor shock, it is probable\r\nthat the focus was continuous, and occupied the space between the two\r\nfoci of the principal earthquake, as well as part or the whole of both\r\nthese foci.\r\n\r\nThe next four shocks occurred at about 3.30, 4, 5, and 5.20 A.M., and\r\nwere more closely associated with the Ross than with the Hereford\r\nfocus, and then followed the principal earthquake at 5.32 A.M.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, at 5.40 or 5.45 A.M., a very slight shock was\r\nfelt, the focus of which was possibly situated in the central region\r\nbetween the two foci. The next, at about 6.15 A.M. (K, Fig. 63),\r\ndisturbed an area 41 miles long, 27 miles broad, and containing about\r\n870 square miles. Its focus must have coincided approximately with the\r\nRoss focus of the principal earthquake, and this was also the case\r\nprobably with the last shock of all, which occurred on July 19th,\r\n1897, at 3.49 A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the epicentral district is covered by a sheet of\r\nOld Red Sandstone (Fig. 64), but, just to the north-east of the\r\nposition laid down for the originating fault (indicated by the\r\nstraight broken line), is the well-known Woolhope anticlinal, by which\r\nSilurian beds are brought to the surface. The anticlinal axis runs\r\napproximately north-west and south-east, and is thus roughly parallel\r\nto the earthquake-fault. Moreover, the thinning-out and occasional\r\ndisappearance of some of the Silurian beds on the south-west side of\r\nthe anticlinal (as compared with those on the north-east side) is\r\nsuggestive of a north-west and south-east fault or rapid flexure at or\r\nnear the south-west junction of the Old Red Sandstone and the\r\nSilurian strata. If it be a fault, it must hade to the north-east, and\r\nwould therefore satisfy two of the conditions determined by the\r\nseismic evidence. It would lie, however, about two miles too far to\r\nthe north-east, being in fact to the north-east of the villages which\r\nsuffered most from the earthquake.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 64.--Geology of meizoseismal area of Hereford\r\n   earthquake. (_Davison._)]\r\n\r\nBut only a few miles to the south-east of the Woolhope anticlinal, and\r\nalmost in the same line with it, there is a second anticlinal, that of\r\nMay Hill. This is a triangular area, and is known to be bounded on all\r\nthree sides by faults. The fault on the north-east side has an average\r\nnorth-west and south-east direction, and, if it were continued through\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone towards the north-west, but bending at first a\r\nfew degrees more to the west, it would pass through a point about\r\n1-1/2 miles west of Hereford. It is worthy of notice that both this\r\nfault and another nearly parallel to it, about half-a-mile farther\r\nnorth-east, stop, according to the Geological Survey map, at the\r\npoints where they enter the Old Red Sandstone. The latter is an area\r\nwhich has never been investigated with thoroughness by modern\r\nstratigraphical methods, and in which it is difficult to trace faults.\r\nIt therefore appears not improbable that the earthquakes were due to\r\nslips along a continuation of this fault.\r\n\r\nWhether this be the case or not, however, it is clear that the\r\nearthquake-fault must pass between the anticlinal areas of Woolhope\r\nand May Hill, the former being on the north-east, and the latter on\r\nthe south-west, side of the fault. At the Hereford focus, the fault\r\nmust hade to the north-east; and, at the Ross focus, it is probable,\r\nfrom the distribution of places where damage occurred to buildings,\r\nthat it hades to the south-west If this be the case, the fault must\r\nchange in hade between the two foci.\r\n\r\nHow long a time had elapsed since the last sign of growth in the\r\nearthquake-fault took place, it is impossible to say; but it must be\r\nmany years in length. During this interval, the stresses tending to\r\nproduce movement along the fault-service had been gradually\r\nincreasing, until they were sufficient to overcome the resistance\r\nopposed to them. It is worthy of notice that the earliest perceptible\r\nmovements were slight. Their function seems to have been to prepare\r\nthe way for the great slips by equalising the difference between\r\nstress and resistance over a large area of the fault-surface. We\r\ncannot trace with accuracy the transference of the seat of movement\r\nfrom one part of the fault-surface to another. The first slip seems to\r\nhave taken place chiefly in the region between the two foci of the\r\nprincipal earthquake; possibly it overlapped both of them partly. The\r\nnext three slips were apparently in the neighbourhood of the Ross\r\nfocus, and were followed by a fifth in the same area as the first.\r\nThen came a series of small movements that we cannot locate further\r\nthan by saying that they were more closely connected with the Ross\r\nfocus than the other.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the preliminary slips within and near the Ross\r\nfocus, the effective stress in that portion of the fault was\r\ndiminished; and this may be the reason why the first great slip took\r\nplace at the Hereford focus. The immediate result of such a movement\r\nwould naturally be an increase of stress in and beyond the terminal\r\nregions, and the next slip might have been expected in an area partly\r\noverlapping the Hereford focus, and either to the north-west or\r\nsouth-east of it. Instead of this, for a distance of two miles in the\r\nlatter direction, there was not the least perceptible movement during\r\nthe principal earthquake, and the second great slip occurred in the\r\nregion beyond occupied by the Ross focus. This second slip, moreover,\r\noccurred within two or three seconds after the other; that is, before\r\nthe earth-waves had time to travel from the Hereford to the Ross\r\nfocus. In other words, the slip at the Ross focus was not a\r\nconsequence of the slip at the Hereford focus; but both were due to a\r\nsingle generative effort.\r\n\r\nNow, a section drawn parallel to the earthquake-fault and on the\r\nnorth-east side of it, would show an anticline near the Hereford focus\r\nand a corresponding syncline near the Ross focus, with an undisplaced\r\nportion in the intermediate region; while a parallel section on the\r\nother side of the fault would show a syncline near the Hereford focus,\r\nan anticline near the Ross focus, and again an undisplaced portion in\r\nthe intermediate region. If further movements tending to accentuate\r\nsuch a structure were to occur (that is, if the anticlinals were to be\r\nmade more anticlinal and the synclines more synclinal), there would\r\ntherefore be two slips, one in each focus; while, along the\r\nfault-surface between, there would be practically no displacement. At\r\nany rate, the earlier stresses in that region may have been fully\r\nrelieved by two slight preliminary slips (those causing the first and\r\nfifth minor earthquakes), and those resulting from the great\r\ndisplacements by the first after-slip which followed in about ten\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour later, another slip took place at the Ross focus, and by\r\nthis the equilibrium of the rock-masses was almost completely\r\nrestored; for we have no certain evidence of any further movements\r\nuntil seven months have elapsed (July 19th, 1897), when there was a\r\nfinal slip in the same region of the fault.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INVERNESS EARTHQUAKE OF SEPTEMBER 18TH, 1901.\r\n\r\nBetween the north-east end of Loch Ness and the Moray Firth at\r\nInverness, there lies a tract of land not more than seven miles in\r\nlength, which is notable as one of those most frequently shaken by\r\nearthquakes in the British Islands. In the intensity of its shocks it\r\nis inferior to the south-east of Essex and the centre of\r\nHerefordshire, and, in mere number, to the celebrated village of\r\nComrie in Perthshire. But, in the interest of its seismic phenomena,\r\nin the light which they cast on the development of the earth's crust,\r\nthe neighbourhood of Inverness has no equal in Great Britain, and not\r\nmany superiors in any part of the world.\r\n\r\nFor this importance from a seismological point of view, the district\r\nis indebted to the great fault which traverses Scotland along the line\r\nof the Caledonian Canal, and to the fact that this fault, although it\r\ndates from Old Red Sandstone times, has not yet finished growing. As\r\nresults of its formation, we have the almost straight cliff along the\r\nsouth-east coast of Rossshire, and the long chain of lakes, beginning\r\nwith Loch Dochfour and Loch Ness, and ending with Loch Oich, Loch\r\nLochy, and Loch Linnhe. As evidences of its persistent though\r\nintermittent growth, we have the slight tremors and earth-sounds\r\noccasionally observed at and near Fort William, and the much stronger\r\nshocks felt in the neighbourhood of Inverness.\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century there were three strong earthquake\r\nshocks in this district. The first and most severe occurred on August\r\n13th, 1816, and was felt over the greater part of Scotland; the second\r\non February 2nd, 1888; and the third and weakest on November 15th,\r\n1890. This last shock was followed by several slighter ones, the\r\nseries ending with a rather smart shock on December 14th. Between this\r\ndate and the summer of 1901 no earthquakes seem to have been felt at\r\nor anywhere near Inverness.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATORY SHOCKS.\r\n\r\nThe date of the first shock of 1901 is not quite certain. One is said\r\nto have been felt at Aldourie (see Fig. 66) some time in June, and a\r\nsecond at Dochgarroch in July. These may have been succeeded by others\r\ntoo slight to attract much notice, but the first to be generally\r\nobserved occurred on September 16th at 6.4 P.M. A weak tremor,\r\naccompanied by a faint sound, was perceived over a nearly circular\r\narea about 12 miles in diameter, and with its centre about 1-1/2 miles\r\nsouth of Dochgarroch. On the next day, at 11 P.M., a quivering lasting\r\ntwo seconds was felt at Inverness, and a weak tremor, accompanied by\r\nsound, at Dochgarroch at 1.15 A.M. on September 18th. Nine minutes\r\nlater, at 1.24 A.M., occurred the principal earthquake, the shock of\r\nwhich would be called a strong one, even in Italy and Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nIn Inverness, the damage to buildings, though seldom serious, was by\r\nno means inconsiderable. One brick building used as a smithy was\r\ndestroyed, several chimneys or parts of them fell, and many\r\nchimney-cans were displaced or overthrown. At Dochgarroch and other\r\nplaces within the meizoseismal area, walls were cracked, chimneys\r\nthrown down, and lintels loosened.\r\n\r\nBut, for this country, an unusual effect of the earthquake was a long\r\ncrack made in the north bank of the Caledonian Canal near Dochgarroch\r\nLochs. It occurred in the middle of the towing-path, and could be\r\ntraced at intervals for a distance of 200 yards to the east of the\r\nLochs, and 400 yards to the west, being often a mere thread, and in no\r\nplace more than half-an-inch wide. Soon after its formation, however,\r\nthe fissure was obliterated by heavy showers of rain.\r\n\r\n\r\nISOSEISMAL LINES AND DISTURBED AREA.\r\n\r\nThe map (Fig. 65) shows the area over which the earthquake was\r\nperceptible. The isoseismal lines are drawn partly continuous and\r\npartly dotted--continuous where some confidence can be placed in their\r\naccuracy, and dotted where their course must be regarded as doubtful,\r\nowing to the rarity or absence of observations.\r\n\r\nThe innermost isoseismal (shown on a larger scale in Fig. 66)\r\ncorresponds to the intensity 8 of the Rossi-Forel scale, and includes\r\nthe places where the shock was strong enough to cause slight\r\nstructural damage to buildings. It is elliptical in form, 12 miles\r\nlong, 7 miles broad, and 67 square mile in area, with its centre at a\r\npoint about 1-1/2 mile east-north-east of Dochgarroch, and its longer\r\naxis running N. 33° E. and S. 33° W.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 65.--Isoseismal lines of the Inverness\r\n   earthquake. (_Davison._)]\r\n\r\nThe remaining isoseismals are less accurately drawn, owing to the\r\nscarcity of observations made in the west of Scotland. Except towards\r\nthe west, however, the course laid down for the isoseismal 7 may be\r\ntrusted. Its length is 53-1/2 miles, width 35 miles, and area 1,500\r\nsquare miles. Its longer axis is almost exactly parallel to that of\r\nthe preceding isoseismal, but the distance between the two curves is 9\r\nmiles on the north-west, and 14 miles on the south-east, side. The\r\nisoseismal 6 is 105 miles long, 87 miles wide, and contains 7,300\r\nsquare miles; and the isoseismal 5, 157 miles long, 143 miles wide,\r\nand about 17,000 square miles in area.\r\n\r\nThe isoseismal 4 may be regarded as the boundary of the disturbed area\r\nof the earthquake, for, so far as known, the shock was not noticed at\r\nany point outside it. Towards the north, it was felt at Wick,\r\nCastletown, and other intermediate places; towards the west at\r\nTobermory in the island of Mull; and, towards the south, at Skelmorlie\r\n(in Ayrshire), Paisley, Belsyde (near Linlithgow), Gullane (near North\r\nBerwick), and Dunbar. Along the east coast of Scotland, between Wick\r\nand Dunbar, there are few places of any size where the shock was not\r\nfelt. The disturbed area of the earthquake is thus 215 miles long from\r\nnorth-east to south-west, 198 miles wide, and contains about 33,000\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\n_Position of the Originating Fault._--The only isoseismals which are\r\ndrawn accurately enough to determine the earthquake-fault are the two\r\ninner ones, those marked 8 and 7; but these are sufficient for the\r\npurpose. It is clear, from the direction of their longer axes, that\r\nthe average direction of the fault must be N. 33° E. and S. 33° W.\r\nAgain, the isoseismals are farther apart towards the south-east than\r\ntowards the north-west, implying that the fault hades to the\r\nsouth-east. Lastly, as the intensity of the shock is greater on the\r\nside towards which the fault hades, it follows that the fault-line\r\nmust lie a short distance (about a mile or so) on the north-west side\r\nof the centre of the isoseismal 8.\r\n\r\nNow, the great fault alluded to above occupies almost exactly the\r\nposition indicated by the seismic evidence. Its mean direction from\r\nTarbat Ness to Loch Linnhe is N. 35° E. and S. 35° W., it hades to the\r\nsouth-east, and the fault-line passes through a point about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile to the north-west of the centre of the\r\nisoseismal 8 (Fig. 66). There can be little doubt, therefore, that the\r\nearthquake was caused by a slip of this fault; and the evidence of the\r\nafter-shocks, as will be seen, offers additional support to this\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe region in which the slip took place may be determined roughly from\r\nthe position and form of the innermost isoseismal. Its centre must\r\nhave been close to the point marked A in Fig. 66, which corresponds to\r\na point about 1-1/2 mile east-north-east of Dochgarroch. In a\r\nhorizontal direction, its length must have been at least five or six\r\nmiles; otherwise, the isoseismal 8 would have been less elongated. It\r\nmust therefore have reached from about half-a-mile north-east of Loch\r\nNess to about half-a-mile south-west of Inverness. Its width, measured\r\nalong the dip of the fault-surface is unknown; but the small distance\r\nbetween the centre of the isoseismal and the fault-line shows that the\r\nprincipal movement took place at a depth which was probably under,\r\nrather than over, one mile.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the evidence afforded by the nature of the shock, in\r\nwhich there was but little variation throughout the disturbed area. At\r\nInverness, a gentle movement was first felt, followed by an\r\nextraordinary quivering, which increased in force for two or three\r\nseconds, and then decreased for two or three seconds; just as the\r\nquivering was about to cease, there was a distinct lurch or heave,\r\nafter which the vibration was much more severe than before and lasted\r\nseveral seconds longer than the first part of the shock. Dalarossie\r\nlies about fourteen miles south-east of Inverness, and here the first\r\nindication was a loud sound, as of an express train, coming from the\r\neast, rushing close to, and then under, the house; this lasted for a\r\nfew seconds, and towards the end of it the house vibrated. Then\r\nsucceeded an interval of quietness for about a second, followed by a\r\nterrific burst or crash, not unlike the crash of a loud thunder peal,\r\nof about two seconds' duration, during which the house distinctly\r\nheaved up once and then sank back. After another brief interval of\r\nquietness, there was a low rumble, like the sound of a dying peal of\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed, in this account, that the two parts of the shock\r\nwere no longer consecutive. There was a short interval of rest between\r\nthem, the intermediate vibrations observed at Inverness being too weak\r\nto be felt at Dalarossie. Still farther away, the extinction became\r\nmore marked. At Aberdeen, for instance, the shock consisted of two\r\nparts, the first a tremble, followed, after an interval of a few\r\nseconds, by a swinging movement of longer duration than the tremble.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of the disturbed area, the shock maintained the same\r\ncharacter of division into two parts, the second of which was of\r\ngreater duration and intensity than the first and consisted of\r\nvibrations of longer period. A phenomenon of such wide occurrence was\r\nclearly not due to local influences. It must have been caused by two\r\nseparate initial impulses, the stronger succeeding the other after an\r\ninterval of a few seconds and taking place in nearly the same region\r\nof the fault.[67]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND-PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\nOutside the isoseismal 5, there are but few records of the\r\nearthquake-sound; but it was heard faintly at Skelmorlie (in\r\nAyrshire), Belsyde (near Linlithgow), and Gullane (near North\r\nBerwick). Towards the north, it was not observed beyond Wick and\r\nWathen (in Caithness). The boundary of the sound-area cannot be laid\r\ndown with any approach to accuracy, but it must have included a\r\ndistrict containing about 27,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole disturbed area, 84 per cent. of the observers\r\nheard the sound. The percentage varies in different counties, from 93\r\nin Inverness-shire to 77 in the counties of Perth and Aberdeen; but\r\nthe records in the more distant regions are too few to allow of the\r\nconstruction of isacoustic lines.\r\n\r\nIn its character, the sound resembled that usually heard with strong\r\nearthquakes, 39 per cent. of the observers having compared it to\r\npassing waggons, traction-engines, etc., 25 per cent. to thunder, 14\r\nto wind, 8 to loads of stones falling, 3 to the fall of heavy bodies,\r\n4 to explosions or the firing of heavy guns, and 7 per cent. to\r\nmiscellaneous sounds. The intensity of the sound gradually diminished\r\noutwards from the epicentre, and most rapidly near the isoseismal 7,\r\nwhich abounds approximately the area in which the sound was very loud\r\nfrom that in which it was distinctly fainter, and also includes nearly\r\nall the places at which loud explosive crashes were heard with the\r\nstrongest vibrations.\r\n\r\nIn the time-relations of the sound and shock, the Inverness earthquake\r\nresembles the Hereford earthquake of 1896. The beginning of the sound\r\npreceded that of the shock in 72 per cent. of the records, coincided\r\nwith it in 20, and followed it in 8 per cent.; the epoch of maximum\r\nintensity of the sound preceded that of the shock in 20 per cent. of\r\nthe records, coincided with it in 73, and followed it in 7 per cent.;\r\nwhile the end of the sound preceded that of the shock in 15 per cent.\r\nof the records, coincided with it in 34, and followed it in 52 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar proportions hold over the greater part of the\r\ndisturbed area, the percentages being nearly the same in the counties\r\nof Inverness, Ross, Nairn, Elgin, Banff, and the most distant\r\ncounties. But in Aberdeenshire an exception occurs, the three epochs\r\nof sound and shock in most cases coinciding with one another. The\r\nmajority of the observations in this county come from the southern\r\npart, and the line joining this district to the epicentre is nearly\r\nperpendicular to the line of the earthquake-fault. This result has an\r\nimportant bearing on the origin of the sound-vibrations. For, if the\r\ngeneral precedence of the sound with respect to the shock were due to\r\nits superior velocity, the percentage of records in which the\r\nbeginning of the sound preceded that of the shock would vary only with\r\nthe distance, and not with the direction from the origin. Indeed,\r\nwith increasing distance from the origin, this percentage should\r\ncontinually approach 100; while that in which the end of the sound\r\nfollowed that of the shock should diminish to zero. There is, however,\r\nno trace of either tendency, the sound being heard after the shock at\r\nplaces close to the boundary of the sound-area. On the other hand, it\r\nthe sound-vibrations were to start simultaneously, or nearly so, from\r\nall parts of the focus, but especially from its marginal regions,\r\nthen, in the greater part of the disturbed area, the sound would be\r\nheard both before and after the shock; for the lateral margins of the\r\nfocus would be the portions nearest to, and farther from, most\r\nobservers; while, at places near the line through the epicentre at\r\nright angles to the earthquake-fault, the three principal epochs of\r\nthe sound and shock should approximately coincide.\r\n\r\nThe inference that the sound-vibrations heard before and after the\r\nshock come from the margins of the focus is also supported by the\r\nobservations on the relative duration of the sound and shock. If we\r\ntake only those records which are free from doubt, in 78 per cent. of\r\nthe total number, the duration of the sound was greater than that of\r\nthe shock; while, in Aberdeenshire, according to 93 per cent. of the\r\nobservers, the durations of sound and shock were equal.\r\n\r\nWe may imagine, then, that the slip within the seismic focus would be\r\ngreatest in a central region, and that it would die outwards in all\r\ndirections towards the edges. The friction arising from the slipping\r\nin the central region would produce chiefly the comparatively large\r\noscillations that formed the perceptible shock; the evanescent creep\r\nwithin the marginal regions would produce the small and rapid\r\nvibrations that were sensible only as sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nWhile the seismic evidence enables us to determine the\r\nsurface-position and the horizontal dimensions of the seismic focus,\r\nit unfortunately throws no light whatever on a point of some\r\nimportance--namely, the direction of the movement which caused the\r\nearthquake. We cannot infer from it whether it was the rock on the\r\nsouth-east or north-west side of the fault that slipped or whether\r\nboth sides slipped at once; nor, if that point had been settled, do we\r\nknow if the movement of the displaced side was upward or downward. In\r\nthe formation of the fault, however, it is clear that either the\r\nsouth-east side has been depressed or the north-west side elevated;\r\nand, as the bed of Loch Ness is below the level of the sea, that the\r\nformer movement has predominated. If the displacements which gave rise\r\nto the earthquake were merely a continuation of the original series of\r\nmovements--and this is, to say the least, a very probable view to\r\ntake--then we may imagine that, for a distance of five or six miles,\r\nand at a depth of about a mile or less, there was a sudden sag\r\ndownwards of the rock on the south-east side of the fault through a\r\ndistance which perhaps in no part exceeded a fraction of an inch.\r\n\r\nFig. 66 is an attempt to represent roughly the displacement which\r\ncaused the principal earthquake. The diagram makes no pretence to\r\naccuracy, and the scale in the vertical direction is enormously\r\ngreater, perhaps a hundred thousand times greater, than that in the\r\nhorizontal direction. The straight line is supposed to represent a\r\nstraight line drawn before the earthquake on the surface of the rock\r\nadjoining the fault on the south-east side and at a depth of about a\r\nmile, and the curve the form of the same line after the earthquake.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 66.--Diagram to illustrate supposed\r\n   fault-displacement causing Inverness earthquake.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of this great slip would obviously be to relieve the stress\r\nin the central region A, and to increase it suddenly in the parts\r\ndenoted by the letters B and C. It is, therefore, in these parts\r\nespecially that we should expect future slips to occur. Each slip\r\nwould of course give rise to an after-shock, and would in like manner\r\nresult in an increase of stress in its own terminal regions, though\r\nchiefly on the side remote from the centre A.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AFTER-SHOCKS AND THEIR ORIGIN.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to form any estimate of the total number of\r\nafter-shocks. The list, compiled from the records of careful observers\r\nonly, includes forty-six shocks and ten earth-sounds, the last of all\r\noccurring on November 21st. But the list is certainly incomplete. It\r\ncontains, for instance, only one entry on September 18th between 3.56\r\nand 9 A.M.; whereas, during the same interval, no fewer than eighteen\r\nslight shocks were felt by one observer at Dochgarroch, while another\r\nnear Aldourie estimates the number of shocks up to October 23rd at\r\nabout seventy. The total number probably did not fall short of one\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nThe majority were certainly very slight, and, at another time, would\r\nhardly have attracted any notice. There were, however, three of much\r\ngreater importance than the rest. These occurred on September 18th at\r\n3.56 and 9 A.M., and on September 30th at 3.39 A.M. The isoseismal\r\nlines of all three are elongated ovals, their longer axes are parallel\r\nto the fault, and their centres lie on the south-east side of the\r\nfault-line. The shocks were therefore evidently due to slips several\r\nmiles in length along the fault. At present, we are concerned more\r\nwith the position of their epicentres. These are indicated by the dots\r\nlettered B, C, D in Fig. 67; the dot marked A denoting the centre of\r\nthe principal earthquake, and the continuous line the path of the\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nThus, within two and a half hours, the great slip was followed by one\r\nwith its centre at B, near the south-west margin of the principal\r\nfocus. About five hours later, the scene of action was suddenly\r\ntransferred to a region with its centre at C on the north-east margin.\r\nBoth slips affected a portion of the fault-surface several miles in\r\nlength, and must therefore have increased the area of displacement,\r\nslightly towards the north-east and considerably towards the\r\nsouth-west. Only small movements occurred during the next twelve days\r\nuntil 3.39 A.M. on September 30th, when another long slip took place,\r\nwith its centre at D, still farther to the south-west, and therefore\r\nagain extending the area and amount of displacement in this direction.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 67.--Map of epicentres of after-shocks of\r\n   Inverness earthquakes. (_Davison._)]\r\n\r\nTurning now to the weaker after-shocks and earth-sounds, we find them\r\naffecting chiefly three regions of the fault. One of these is close to\r\nDochgarroch, another near Inverness, and the third between Aldourie\r\nand Drumnadrochit; the effects of the slips in the last two districts\r\nbeing, as before, to extend the area of displacement a short distance\r\n(perhaps half a mile) to the north-east and not less than six miles to\r\nthe south-west underneath Loch Ness.\r\n\r\nThe unequal division of the after-shocks between the two sides of the\r\nprincipal centre (A, Fig. 67) is very marked. The positions of the\r\nepicentres of forty-four shocks and earth-sounds can be determined\r\nwith more or less accuracy, and, of these, only ten lie to the\r\nnorth-east of the principal centre, while thirty-four lie to the\r\nsouth-west, six or seven of the latter being beneath Loch Ness.\r\n\r\nOne other point may be referred to before leaving these minor shocks.\r\nSo far as regards the stronger shocks, there was a continual decrease\r\nin the depths of the seismic foci. This is shown by the progressive\r\napproach of their epicentres towards the fault-line; the distances in\r\nthe three chief after-shocks being 1.7, 1.0, and 0.5 miles\r\nrespectively; and in one of the latest shocks (that of October 13th at\r\n4.24 P.M., E, Fig. 67) the distance is no more than one-tenth of a\r\nmile. The focus of this shock must, indeed, have been quite close to\r\nthe surface near Dochgarroch. This constant diminution in the depth of\r\nthe foci shows that the great slip was followed by a sudden increase\r\nof stress upwards as well as laterally, and explains why that slip did\r\nnot leave any perceptible trace, either as fault-scarp or fissure, at\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPATHETIC EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that, of the 56 recorded after-shocks, at least six\r\nwere felt or heard only at Dalarossie and other places in the valley\r\nof the Findhorn, a valley which lies about 13 or 14 miles to the\r\nsouth-east of the great fault. That they had no connection with that\r\nfault is certain, for two of them were so strong that, if they were so\r\nconnected, they could not have escaped the notice of one or more of\r\nthe watchful observers between Drumnadrochit and Inverness. The\r\nprobable explanation of these after-shocks is that they were due to\r\nslips of a fault running along the Findhorn valley;[68] and that the\r\ngreat displacement near Inverness on September 18th led to a sudden\r\nincrease of stress within the rocks for many miles around, which, at\r\nand near Dalarossie, was sufficient to precipitate the slips referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, two earthquakes could hardly be more unlike than the\r\nJapanese earthquake of 1891 and the Inverness earthquake of 1901. In\r\nthe rice-fields of central Japan, as we have seen, the roads for many\r\nleagues were edged with ruins, the fault-slip was prolonged up to the\r\nsurface and visible as a scarp forty, if not seventy, miles in length,\r\nplots of ground were compressed and their boundaries altered, the\r\nhillsides were scored by landslips, places can now be seen from one\r\nanother that formerly were hidden by a mountain ridge, and the total\r\nnumber of after-shocks within little more than two years amounted to\r\nabove three thousand. On the other hand, when we examine the\r\ndistribution of the after-shocks in space, we find that, though no\r\npart of the fault was exempt from slips, they favoured three regions\r\nin particular--one, the most important, a central region, yet not\r\ncoincident with that in which the principal shock was most intense;\r\nand the other two surrounding the extremities of the fault. With the\r\nlapse of time, the after-shocks on the whole became weaker and\r\noccurred less frequently, and the average depth of the foci gradually\r\ndiminished. Moreover, in two districts distant forty-five and\r\nfifty-five miles from the fault, the frequency of the shocks during\r\nthe month succeeding the earthquake was suddenly increased to ten and\r\nsixteen times the normal rate.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice so close a similarity in character,\r\nsubsisting with so vast a difference in the scale of intensity. The\r\nidentity of the powers at work in shaping the structure of both\r\nislands Is manifest. In Japan, we see the mountain-making forces\r\nacting with violence and producing effects that are only too apparent\r\nto the eye. In Scotland, whatever may have happened in former\r\ngeological epochs, the changes in surface-structure are now taking\r\nplace with almost infinite slowness, and hundreds or thousands of\r\nyears must elapse before Loch Ness makes any visible progress in its\r\nmarch towards the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.\r\n\r\n  1.

In this, as in\r\nother similar cases, discrepancies in the observations are\r\nunavoidable; but it is important to notice that they are least\r\nfrequent in the observations evidently made with the greatest care.\r\n\r\n[65] Except in the case of Yorkshire, where the three Ridings are\r\nregarded as separate counties.\r\n\r\n[66] The Derby earthquake of March 24th, 1903, was also a twin\r\nearthquake. The centres of the two foci were situated near Ashbourne\r\nand Wirksworth, above eight or nine miles apart, along a line running\r\nN. 33° E. and S. 33° W. The two parts of the shock coalesced along a\r\nrectilineal band about five miles wide running centrally across the\r\nlower isoseismals in a direction at right angles to their longer axes.\r\nThe isacoustic lines are also elongated in the direction of this band.\r\nIn this case, the impulses at the two foci must have taken place at\r\nthe same instant. (_Quart. Journ. Geo. Soc._, vol. lx., 1904, pp.\r\n215-232.)\r\n\r\n[67] If the foci of the two impulses had been detached, there would,\r\nwith so small an interval between the two parts, have been a variation\r\nin the nature of the shock like that observed during the Hereford\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\n[68] This part of Inverness-shire has not yet been mapped by the\r\nGeological Survey, but a fault is known to exist in the Findhorn\r\nvalley near Drysachan Lodge, which lies about eleven miles down the\r\nvalley from Dalarossie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN EARTHQUAKE OF JUNE 12TH, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery different from the shocks of Britain was the earthquake that\r\noverwhelmed so large a part of its great dependency on June 12th,\r\n1897--an earthquake which, if it is not without a rival, is certainly\r\none of the most disastrous and most widely-felt of which we possess\r\nany record. That it was of the first magnitude was evident at once in\r\nCalcutta from the extensive injury to buildings, and its investigation\r\nwas undertaken without delay by the members of the Geological Survey\r\nof India. The four officers who were at the headquarters in Calcutta\r\nwere despatched to the area of greatest damage, letters and circulars\r\nwere distributed as widely as possible, a large number of observers\r\nwere induced to co-operate by keeping records of the after-shocks,\r\nand, later on, during the cold weather of 1897-98, Mr. R.D. Oldham,\r\none of the superintendents of the Survey, made a tour through the\r\nepicentral district. To him, moreover, fell the much harder task of\r\ndiscussing the very numerous observations collected by himself and\r\nothers; and the least that can be said of the valuable report prepared\r\nby him is that it is worthy of a great subject. Professor Omori also\r\nspent several months in studying the earthquake on behalf of the\r\nJapanese Government; but the account, which is written in his own\r\nlanguage, unfortunately remains a sealed book to western\r\nseismologists.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 68.--Isoseismal Lines of Indian Earthquake.\r\n   (_Oldham._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nISOSEISMAL LINES AND DISTURBED AREA.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 68, which shows the area disturbed by the earthquake, Mr.\r\nOldham has drawn two series of curves. In the absence of detailed\r\nrecords of the intensity--records that could not have been obtained\r\nfrom some parts of the disturbed area, and would have been difficult\r\nto procure in sufficient number from others--he has represented by the\r\ndotted curves a group of isoseismals in the form which he believes\r\nthey would have assumed had the earth-waves been propagated in a\r\nhomogeneous medium. The first includes all places, such as Shillong\r\nand Goalpara, where the destruction of brick and stone buildings was\r\npractically universal; the second, those, like Darjiling, in which\r\ndamage to buildings was universal and often serious; the third,\r\nplaces, like Calcutta, where the earthquake was strong enough to\r\ninjure all or nearly all brick buildings. Inside the fourth\r\nisoseismal, the shock was strong enough to disturb furniture and loose\r\nobjects, but not to cause more than slight damage; within the fifth,\r\nit was generally noticed; and, beyond this, and as far as the sixth\r\nisoseismal, the earthquake was perceived only by a small number of\r\nsensitive persons at rest. The approximation of the curves towards the\r\neast and south-east, Mr. Oldham believes to be partly real, and not\r\ndue to imperfect information.\r\n\r\nThe continuous curves represent more closely the actual variation of\r\nintensity. The innermost curve A indicates the probable boundary of\r\nthe epicentral tract, which is about 200 miles in length and more than\r\n6000 square miles in area. This will be referred to afterwards in\r\ngreater detail. The next curve B bounds the region within which\r\nserious damage to brick houses was common. Its irregular course is\r\nclosely connected with the geological structure of the country, and is\r\ndue to the fact, of which we have already met with several examples,\r\nthat earthquakes are more destructive to houses built on alluvial\r\nground than to those founded on rock. The area included within this\r\ncurve is not less than 145,000 square miles; and, if we include the\r\nparts from which reports were not obtainable, it must amount to about\r\n160,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe curve C represents the boundary of the disturbed area, so far as\r\nknown, for about one-third of the area lies in regions from which no\r\ninformation was procurable, while another third is inhabited by\r\nignorant and illiterate tribes. But, notwithstanding this, the shock\r\nis known to have been felt over an area of at least 1,200,000 square\r\nmiles. If we include the detached region to the west, near Ahmedabad,\r\nthe portion of the Bay of Bengal in which the shock would have been\r\nfelt had the sea been replaced by land, and a large part of Thibet or\r\nWestern China, from which no reports have come, but in which the shock\r\nwas certainly sensible, this estimate, great as it is, must be raised\r\nto about 1,750,000 square miles.[69]\r\n\r\nFigures, such as those given above, convey but little idea of the\r\nvastness of the area concerned. Transferring them to countries with\r\nwhich we are more familiar, we may say that the disturbed area was\r\nonly a little less than half the size of Europe; the region in which\r\nserious damage occurred to masonry was more than twice as large as the\r\nwhole of Great Britain; while, if the centre of the epicentral tract\r\nhad been in Birmingham, nearly every brick and stone building between\r\nYork and Exeter would have been levelled with the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nFew and slight were the forerunners of the greatest of modern\r\nearthquakes. Early in June, faint tremors were felt by sensitive\r\npersons at Shillong. Others at the same place heard a rumbling sound\r\nfor ten or fifteen seconds before the shock began, and at Silchar\r\nbirds were seen to rise suddenly from trees before the movement became\r\nsensible to man. Except for these almost imperceptible warnings, the\r\nearthquake broke abruptly over the whole district.\r\n\r\n\"At 5.15,\" writes one observer at Shillong, \"a deep rumbling sound,\r\nlike near thunder commenced, apparently coming from the south or\r\nsouth-west.... The rumbling preceded the shock by about two seconds\r\n... and the shock reached its maximum violence almost at once, in the\r\ncourse of the first two or three seconds. The ground began to rock\r\nviolently, and in a few seconds it was impossible to stand upright,\r\nand I had to sit down suddenly on the road. The shock was of\r\nconsiderable duration, and maintained roughly the same amount of\r\nviolence from the beginning to the end. It produced a very distinct\r\nsensation of sea-sickness.... The feeling was as if the ground was\r\nbeing violently jerked backwards and forwards very rapidly, every\r\nthird or fourth jerk being of greater scope than the intermediate\r\nones. The surface of the ground vibrated visibly in every direction,\r\nas if it was made of soft jelly; and long cracks appeared at once\r\nalong the road.... The road is bounded here and there by low banks of\r\nearth, about two feet high, and these were all shaken down quite flat.\r\nThe school building, which was in sight, began to shake at the first\r\nshock, and large slabs of plaster fell from the walls at once. A few\r\nmoments afterwards the whole building was lying flat, the walls\r\ncollapsed, and the corrugated iron roof lying bent and broken on the\r\nground. A pink cloud of plaster and dust was seen hanging over every\r\nhouse in Shillong at the end of the shock.... My impression at the end\r\nof the shock was that its duration was certainly under one minute, and\r\nthat it had travelled from south to north.... The violence of the\r\nshock may be imagined when it is stated that the whole of the damage\r\ndone was completed in the first ten or fifteen seconds of the shock.\"\r\n\r\nOther estimates of the duration are generally higher than that given\r\nabove, ranging from three to five or even more minutes at Tura,\r\nDhubri, Silchar, Calcutta, and other places. In some cases, it is\r\npossible that the immediately succeeding tremors were included as part\r\nof the great shock; but, in the central area, it is probable that the\r\naverage duration of the shock did not differ much from three or four\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nIn this district, the movement was most complicated. Changes of\r\ndirection were frequently noticed. At Silchar, for instance, the\r\nearthquake began with an undulatory movement from north to south, like\r\nthe swinging of a suspension bridge; it closed with a motion like\r\nthat of a boat tossed in a choppy sea, or by the crossing of great\r\nwaves which, whatever their dominant direction may have been,\r\ncertainly did not travel from north to south. The vertical component\r\nof the motion must have been considerable; for, at Shillong, loose\r\nstones lying on the roads were tossed in the air \"like peas on a\r\ndrum,\" But this was even less pronounced than the horizontal movement,\r\nthe range of which was at least eight or nine inches, and during which\r\npeople felt as if they were being shaken like a rat by a terrier. The\r\nperiod of these vibrations was estimated at about a second.\r\n\r\nAs they left the central region, the period of the waves lengthened,\r\nso that, at a distance, the shock no longer consisted of short jerks,\r\nbut became a gentle rocking motion, causing in some people a sensation\r\nof nausea. At Calcutta, the undulations were regular and resembled the\r\nrolling of a mighty ship, the period being between one and two\r\nseconds. At Balasor, the motion was a long rolling one, such as would\r\nbe felt on the deck of a ship in a fairly heavy sea; and, farther to\r\nthe south as far as the limit of the disturbed area, the same\r\nundulatory movements were observed, gradually decreasing in intensity,\r\nand usually compared to the easy motion of a ship in a gentle sea.\r\n\r\n_Visible Earth-Waves._--A few examples have already been given of the\r\nobservation of visible waves on the surface of the ground. They were\r\nseen at Charleston during the earthquake of 1886 (p. 110), and at\r\nAkasaka and other places in the meizoseismal area during the Japanese\r\nearthquake of 1891 (p. 186). But they were more than usually\r\nprominent in the Indian earthquake; indeed, much of the difficulty\r\nexperienced in standing during the shock seems to have been due to the\r\npassage of these surface-waves.\r\n\r\nAt Shillong, according to an observer quoted above (p. 266), the\r\nsurface of the ground vibrated visibly in every direction, as if it\r\nwere made of soft jelly. Another describes it as presenting \"the aspect\r\nof a storm-tossed sea, with this difference that the undulations were\r\ninfinitely more rapid than any seen at sea.\" Near Maimansingh,\r\nearth-waves were watched approaching, exactly like rollers on the\r\nsea-coast, and, as they passed, the observers had a difficulty in\r\nstanding. At Nalbari, the rice in the fields could be seen rising and\r\nfalling at intervals during the transit of the waves. In the Assam\r\nvalley, near Mangaldai, there were seen \"waves coming from opposite\r\ndirections and meeting in a great heap and then falling back; each time\r\nthe waves seemed to fall back the ground opened slightly, and each time\r\nthey met, water and sand were thrown up to a height of about 18 inches\r\nor so.\" Even as far as Midnapur, the ground was \"distinctly billowy,\"\r\nand at Allahabad a series of waves was observed to cross the ground\r\nfrom south-south-west to north-north-east.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously difficult to judge in any case of the magnitude of\r\nsuch waves. In the epicentral area, Mr. Oldham believes that, on an\r\naverage, they were probably about thirty feet long and one foot in\r\nheight, though some may have been both shorter and higher. These\r\nmovements must have been comparatively slow, for their progress could\r\nbe easily followed by the eye; indeed, their rate, as one witness\r\nremarks, \"though decidedly faster than a man could walk, was not so\r\nfast as he could run.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMENTS OF THE WAVE-MOTION.\r\n\r\nIn his study of the Neapolitan earthquake, Mallet showed how the\r\namplitude and maximum velocity of the vibrations could be determined\r\nroughly from the displacement, projection, or overthrow of various\r\nbodies by the earthquake. Somewhat similar methods were employed by\r\nMr. Oldham in the absence of seismographs from the epicentral area.\r\nHis results are of course only approximate, but they lead nevertheless\r\nto a conclusion of great value and interest.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 69.--Section of Tombs in the Cemetery at\r\n   Cherrapunji. (_Oldham._)]\r\n\r\n_Amplitude._--The best measure of the amplitude was obtained at the\r\ncemetery at Cherrapunji, situated near the southern margin of the\r\nepicentral area. Here were two oblong masonry tombs (Fig. 69),\r\nstanding close together with their longer axes pointing north and\r\nsouth. Their inner sides were partially destroyed. \"On the outer\r\nsides, they are almost intact, but the tombs have been driven bodily\r\ndown into the ground, and on either side to east and west, there is a\r\ndepression with a vertical side parallel to the outer surface of the\r\ntomb and a smooth flat bottom over which the base of the tomb has\r\nslid.... The edge of the western depression has the grass growing\r\nundisturbed up to the edge of it, and along the edge small fragments\r\nof lime and plaster show that this was originally in contact with the\r\nedge of the tomb, which has now moved away to a distance of 18 inches.\r\nOn the east the edge of the depression is raised and the grass and\r\nearth forced upwards by the thrust of the tomb against it; the breadth\r\nof this depression is 10 inches.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the movement of the ground, the tombs, owing to their inertia,\r\nremained comparatively stationary, and the depressions were formed by\r\nthe backward and forward movement of the ground against them. The\r\nmovement on the east side was clearly arrested in some manner, and the\r\nrange therefore cannot have been less than 10 inches. It may have been\r\nas much as 18 inches, and was probably, in Mr. Oldham's opinion, the\r\nmean of these two amounts--namely, 14 inches. This would give an\r\namplitude of about 7 inches, a value which may be in excess of the\r\naverage amount elsewhere in the district, as the cemetery is situated\r\nnear the edge of a high sandstone scarp.\r\n\r\nAt Tura, also within the epicentral area, a range of not less than 10\r\ninches was given by the sliding of a wooden house over the posts on\r\nwhich it rested. Six months after the shock, Mr. Oldham frequently\r\nnoticed vacant spaces four or five inches across by the side of large\r\nboulders scattered over the Khasi hills, and he infers that\r\n\"throughout the whole tract lying west of Shillong and Gauhati, as far\r\nas the hills extend, and probably over a large area of the plains\r\nbesides, the amplitude of the wave-motion was nowhere less than 3\r\ninches, while in many places it was over 6 inches.\"\r\n\r\n_Maximum Velocity._--The most trustworthy measure of the maximum\r\nvelocity are those obtained from the projection of bodies. Mr. Oldham\r\nselects the following as most deserving of notice:--At Goalpara, an\r\nobelisk surmounting a tomb was broken off and thrown to one side,\r\ngiving a maximum velocity of not less than 11 feet per second. At\r\nGauhati, the coping of a small gate-pillar was shot off and fell at a\r\ndistance of 4 feet 4 inches from the centre of the pillar; in this\r\ncase the maximum velocity must have exceeded 8 feet per second. The\r\nhighest velocity, of more than 16 feet per second, was measured at\r\nRambrai, where a small group of monoliths were shot out of the ground,\r\none of them to a distance of 6-1/2 feet. Lastly, at Silchar, a bullet\r\nwas projected from the corner of a wooden post, acting as a rough form\r\nof seismometer, from which a maximum velocity of at least 1-1/2 feet\r\nper second was deduced.\r\n\r\n_Maximum Acceleration._--Estimates of the maximum horizontal\r\nacceleration were made from 28 overthrown pillars by means of\r\nProfessor West's formula (p. 184, footnote). The measures obtained at\r\nthe same place show some variation, but Mr. Oldham considers as fair\r\naverage values those of 14 feet per second per second at Goalpara, 12\r\nat Gauhati, Shillong, and Sylhet, 10 at Cherrapunji, 9 at Dhubri, and\r\n4 feet per second per second at Silchar.\r\n\r\nOf the vertical component of the acceleration, not even the roughest\r\nnumerical estimate can be formed. We know, however, that at Shillong,\r\nGauhati, and indeed throughout the epicentral area, stones were\r\nprojected upwards, and this is evidence that the vertical component\r\nwas greater than that of gravity--namely, 32 feet per second per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nViolent as the shock was at the places just mentioned, it must have\r\nbeen still greater in certain parts of the epicentral area. At Dilma,\r\nin the Garo hills, the shock seems to have been strong enough to\r\ndisable men; and, in the neighbourhood of the faults that will be\r\ndescribed in a later section, forest trees were snapped in two.\r\nFortunately, as Mr. Oldham remarks, there were in these districts no\r\ntowns or populous settlements to feel the full power of the earthquake\r\nto destroy.\r\n\r\n_Anomalies in the above Measurements._--If the movements of the ground\r\nfollowed the law of simple harmonic motion, any two of the four\r\nelements (period, amplitude, maximum velocity, and maximum\r\nacceleration) would suffice to determine the others (p. 4). Applying\r\nthe usual formulæ to the quantities obtained at Gauhati--namely, 8\r\nfeet per second for the maximum velocity and 12 feet per second per\r\nsecond for the maximum acceleration, it follows that the amplitude\r\nwould be 5 feet and the period 4 seconds--values, which are evidently\r\ninadmissible. Or, taking the maximum vertical component at 32 feet per\r\nsecond per second, the corresponding values would be 2 feet and 1-1/2\r\nseconds, that of the amplitude being still too great. Again, at\r\nRambrai, the maximum velocity was found to exceed 16 feet per second.\r\nThe other elements are unknown, but, if the amplitude were one foot,\r\nMr. Oldham shows that the maximum acceleration would be 256 feet per\r\nsecond per second; or, taking the amplitude at the impossible amount\r\nof two feet, that the maximum acceleration would be 128 feet per\r\nsecond per second.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that only part of the high velocities at\r\nRambrai and elsewhere can be due to the elastic waves provoked by the\r\ninitial disturbances. The remaining portion must be attributed to a\r\nbodily displacement of the earth's crust within the epicentral area--a\r\ndisplacement of which the fault-scarps and other distortions of that\r\nregion furnish ample evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND-PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\nIn the epicentral area, the sound that accompanied the earthquake was\r\nremarkable for its extraordinary loudness. At Shillong, the crash of\r\nhouses falling within thirty yards was completely drowned by the roar\r\nof the earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe sound was generally compared to distant thunder, the passage of a\r\ntrain or cart, etc.; but, whatever the type may be, it always implies\r\na sound of deep pitch, close to the lower limit of audibility--a\r\ncontinuous rumbling or rattling noise, as a rule gradually becoming\r\nlouder and then dying away. There was the usual conflict in the\r\nevidence of different observers due to the depth of the sound. In\r\nCalcutta, which lies well within the sound-area, some persons asserted\r\nthat they heard a rumbling noise; others were positive that the only\r\nnoise was that caused by falling buildings and furniture. Some, again,\r\nnoticed that the shock was preceded by a loud roar; while others were\r\ncertain that there was no sound of any kind until the earthquake had\r\nbecome severe.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the disturbed area, it is impossible to define the\r\nboundary of the region over which the sound was heard. Like the shock,\r\nalso, it seems to have been observed farther to the west than towards\r\nthe east. Leaving out of account records that are possibly doubtful,\r\nthe sound was heard for a distance of 330 miles to the west and\r\nsouth-west, and 290 miles to the east of the epicentral area--that is,\r\nallowing for the dimensions of that area, it must have been\r\nperceptible over a region measuring not less than 800 miles from east\r\nto west.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF THE EARTH-WAVES.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat doubtful whether a more accurate estimate of the\r\nvelocity is to be obtained from a violent earthquake or from one of\r\nmoderate intensity. In the former case, the vast distances to which\r\nthe shock is noticed lessen the effects of errors in the\r\ntime-determinations, but this advantage is to a great extent\r\ncompensated by the considerable duration of the shock and the\r\nconsequent uncertainty whether all observers have timed the same phase\r\nof the movement. Also, in the Indian earthquake, there are further\r\nsources of error in the variety of standard times employed throughout\r\nthe country and in the magnitude of the epicentral area.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous time-records collected by Mr. Oldham, the best are\r\nthose which were obtained from a few self-recording instruments, from\r\nthe more busy telegraph offices, from the larger railway stations, and\r\nin some cases from private individuals. All records were in the first\r\nplace subjected to a rigid process of selection; a large number were\r\nrejected on various grounds, and those only were retained which bore\r\ninternal evidence of accuracy, due either to the conditions of the\r\nreporter's occupation or to the care taken by him to ensure exactness.\r\nTo guard against any unconscious bias in making the selection, this\r\nprocess was carried out before the distances were calculated, and even\r\nbefore the position of the epicentral area was known.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of this area is shown by the continuous line A in Fig.\r\n68. Its greatest length being about 200 miles from east to west, it is\r\nnecessary in the first place to fix upon an equivalent centre within\r\nit, which may be regarded for this special purpose as the point of\r\ndeparture of the earth-waves. The more natural course perhaps would be\r\nto assume this point to coincide with the centre of the area. But, as\r\nthe rate at which the initial movement spread over that area would\r\nprobably differ little from the velocity of the earth-wave, and as all\r\nthe time-stations lie towards the west, Mr. Oldham regards a point\r\nnear the western boundary of the area (in lat. 25° 45' N. and long.\r\n90° 15' E.) as a sufficiently exact approximation to the position of\r\nthe equivalent centre.\r\n\r\nThe nearest place at which good time-observations were made is\r\nCalcutta, distant 255.5 miles from the assumed centre. One is\r\nindicated on the recording tide-gauge by a sudden rise of the water,\r\nwhile the others were obtained from the central telegraph office, the\r\nterminal railway stations, and from two careful readings by interested\r\nobservers. They vary from 4h. 27m. 0s. to 4h. 28m. 37s. P.M., all\r\nbeing liable to an error of half-a-minute. The arithmetic mean for the\r\nbeginning of the shock is 4h. 27m. 49s., and this is probably as\r\naccurate an estimate as the conditions allow.[70]\r\n\r\nBombay lies outside the disturbed area, 1208.3 miles from the\r\nequivalent centre; and, for the time of arrival in that city, we have\r\nto depend on the records of the barograph and the three magnetographs.\r\nThe horizontal force magnet was set in motion two and a half minutes\r\nbefore the others, no doubt by the advance tremors. The times given by\r\nthe barograph and the vertical force-instrument differ by only one\r\nminute, and the best result seems to be that obtained by taking their\r\nmean--namely, 4h. 35m. 43s., which is probably accurate to within a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that the time-interval between Calcutta and Bombay\r\ndoes not err by more than half-a-minute, it follows that the\r\nintervening velocity must lie between 2.8 and 3.2 kilometres per\r\nsecond, its probable value being 3 kilometres, or 2 miles, per second.\r\n\r\nThe remaining records, which are of less value than those obtained in\r\nthese cities, fall into two groups, the first consisting of a number\r\nof stations along a line running north and south between Calcutta and\r\nDarjiling or within a hundred miles on either side of the same, and\r\nthe second a long series of stations crossing Northern India in a\r\nnearly westerly direction. The observations made at the Burmese\r\nstations were unfortunately affected by an error arising from the\r\nretardation of the Madras time-signals through frequent repetition\r\nalong the line.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 70.--Time-curve of Indian earthquake.\r\n   (_Oldham._)]\r\n\r\nIndividually, these records are not exact enough to be used in\r\ndetermining the velocity, but they may be employed collectively for\r\nthe construction of the time-curve in Fig. 70. In this diagram,\r\ndistances in hundreds of miles from the equivalent centre are\r\nrepresented along the horizontal line, and the time of occurrence in\r\nminutes past 4 P.M. along the perpendicular line. The small circles\r\nrepresent the observations at Calcutta and Bombay, the dots those at\r\nplaces lying nearly west of the origin, and the crosses those at\r\nplaces situated to the south or north-west. The continuous curve\r\npasses in an average manner through the series of points, and probably\r\ndoes not differ much from the true curve of the time of arrival of the\r\nshock at different places. The curve, it will be noticed, is at first\r\nconcave, and afterwards convex, upwards; indicating that the times\r\nrequired to traverse successive equal distances at first increased,\r\nand then decreased. Thus, if the curve is an accurate representation\r\nof the facts, it would follow that the surface-velocity was subject to\r\na continual decrease outwards from the centre, until it was a minimum\r\nat a distance of about 280 miles, after which it increased.\r\n\r\nThe deviation of the curve from a straight line is, however, so slight\r\nthat we cannot feel much confidence in this conclusion. If we join the\r\npoints corresponding to Calcutta and Bombay by a straight line (drawn\r\ndotted in Fig. 70), it does not in any part vary from the continuous\r\nline by a distance equivalent to more than half-a-minute. Indeed, if a\r\nvery few discordant records are excluded, and if less weight is given\r\nto those times which are multiples of five minutes, the straight line\r\nrepresents the mean quite as fairly as the curved line does; and that\r\nthis is the more probable interpretation will appear from the\r\nobservations on the unfelt earthquake described in the next section.\r\nWe may therefore conclude that the earth-waves travelled along the\r\nsurface at an approximately uniform rate of 3 kilometres per second,\r\nor about 120 miles a minute--a result which Mr. Oldham considers may\r\nbe accepted as accurate to within five per cent.\r\n\r\nIf the two time-curves in Fig. 70 are continued to the right until\r\nthey meet the time-scale, it will be seen that they intersect it near\r\nthe point corresponding to 4.26 P.M., implying that this would be\r\napproximately the time at which the shock was felt within the\r\nepicentral area. This agrees closely with the observed times of about\r\n4.25 at Parbatipur and Kuch Bihar, 4.26 at Siliguri, and 4.27 at\r\nShillong and Goalpara; and it is probable that the error is not more\r\nthan a quarter of a minute in defect or half-a-minute in excess. Thus,\r\nthe time of arrival of the first sensible waves at the surface would\r\nlie between 4h. 25m. 45s., and 4h. 26m. 30s. P.M., Madras time, or\r\nbetween 11h. 4m. 45s. and 11h. 5m. 30s. A.M., Greenwich mean time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNFELT EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nOf the crowd of vibrations that agitate the ground during an\r\nearthquake, part only combine to form the perceptible shock. Some are\r\ninsensible owing to their small amplitude, others to the slowness of\r\nthe motion. An interesting observation belonging to the latter class\r\nwas made by an engineer near Midnapur, a place which lies just within\r\nthe area of damage. At the time of the earthquake, he was taking\r\nlevels on a railway bank, and was about to take a reading when he\r\nnoticed the bubble of the level oscillating. In five or ten seconds\r\nthe shaking began and appeared to last three or four minutes; but, for\r\nmore than five minutes after it had apparently ceased, the level\r\nshowed that the ground continued to rock.\r\n\r\nAgain, in Burmah, at a place nineteen miles east of Tagaung and close\r\nto the border of the disturbed area, the water in a shallow tank,\r\nabout 300 yards in length, was seen lapping up against the side in a\r\nmanner that was at first attributed to elephants bathing. No shock was\r\nfelt, but the shaking of the trees at the same time showed that the\r\ndisturbance was due to the earthquake.\r\n\r\nFar beyond the limits of the disturbed area, however, the earthquake\r\nwas recorded by many of the delicate instruments which have been\r\nemployed during the last few years for the registration of distant\r\nshocks. Among the more important of these instruments are long\r\nvertical pendulums, horizontal pendulums of various forms, and\r\nmagnetographs. In the vertical, and some of the horizontal,\r\npendulums, especially in those used in the Italian observatories, the\r\nmasses carried are heavy, and the movements of the ground are\r\nmagnified by lightly-balanced levers ending in points which trace\r\ntheir records on bands of smoked paper driven by clockwork. In the\r\nother horizontal pendulums and in the magnetographs, the method of\r\nregistration is photographic. The paper required for the mechanical\r\nrecords being inexpensive, a high velocity (half-an-inch or more per\r\nminute) can be given to it, and the resulting diagrams are open and\r\ndetailed. The Italian instruments also respond more readily than the\r\nothers to the earlier and slighter tremors: while the apparatus in\r\nwhich photographic methods are used are sometimes so violently\r\ndisturbed by the later undulations that the spot of light fails to\r\nleave any trace on the photographic paper. It is therefore from the\r\nItalian observatories that the more interesting records come. One of\r\nthese, given by a horizontal pendulum at Rocca di Papa near Rome, is\r\nreproduced in Fig. 71; while the curve of the bifilar pendulum at\r\nEdinburgh (Fig. 72) is a good example of those obtained by the\r\nphotographic method of registration.[71]\r\n\r\nAll over Italy, from Ischia and Catania in the south to Pavia in the\r\nnorth, the different instruments employed began, one after the other,\r\nto write their records of the movement as the unfelt earth-waves sped\r\noutwards from the centre. Italy passed, the tale was taken up by\r\nmagnetographs at Potsdam and Wilhelmshaven, Pawlovsk (near St.\r\nPetersburg), Copenhagen, Utrecht, and Parc St. Maur (near Paris); by\r\nhorizontal pendulums at Strassburg and Shide (in the Isle of Wight),\r\nand by a bifilar pendulum at Edinburgh. Shide is 4,891 miles from the\r\ncentre of disturbance, but, as we shall see, the movement could be\r\ntraced for a distance greater even than this.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 71.--Seismographic Record of Indian\r\n   Earthquake at Rocca di Papa. (_Cancani._)]\r\n\r\nIn the more complete records, and especially in those given by the\r\nItalian apparatus, Mr. Oldham distinguishes three phases of motion.\r\nThe first consists of rapid and nearly horizontal movements of the\r\nground. In Italy, it begins at about 11.17 A.M.--that is, about 12-1/2\r\nminutes after the commencement of the shock at the epicentre (Fig. 71,\r\n_a_). Without any break in the movement, and after a further interval\r\nof about 8-1/2 minutes, the second phase begins; the vibrations are\r\nsimilar to the preceding, but they are larger and more open, and are\r\naccompanied by an unmistakable tilting of the surface of the ground\r\n(Fig. 71, _b_). Lastly, after the lapse of about twenty minutes more,\r\nthe second phase gives place, without interruption, to the third (Fig.\r\n71, _c_),[72] consisting of well-marked slow undulations, which have\r\nbeen aptly compared by Professor Milne to the movements caused by an\r\nocean-swell. As they travelled across Europe, the surface of the\r\nground was thrown into a series of flat waves, 34 miles in length, and\r\n20 inches in maximum height, the complete period of each wave being 22\r\nseconds. This phase is by far the longest of the three; in the more\r\nsensitive instruments, two or three hours elapsed before their traces\r\nceased to show any sign of movement.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 72.--Seismographic Record of Indian\r\n   Earthquake at Edinburgh. (_Heath._)]\r\n\r\nKnowing the distances of the different observatories from the\r\nepicentre, and the times taken by each phase to reach them, we can\r\nform some idea of the rates at which they travelled. If the early\r\ntremors moved in straight lines, their mean velocity for the first\r\nphase was 9.0, and for the second 5.3, kilometres per second; but, if\r\nthey moved along curved paths through the body of the earth, their\r\nmean velocities must have exceeded these amounts. For the first\r\nundulations of the third phase, the velocity would be 2.9 kilometres\r\nper second if they travelled along straight lines, and 3.0 kilometres\r\nper second if they were confined to the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the second phase was noticed for the first time by\r\nMr. Oldham in the records of the Indian earthquake, but he has since\r\ndetected it in those of other shocks. He believes, in common with most\r\nseismologists, that the first phase corresponds to waves of elastic\r\ncompression, or longitudinal waves, travelling through the body of the\r\nearth; and the second phase he attributes to waves of elastic\r\ndistortion, or transversal waves, travelling in the same way, in which\r\nthe particles move at right angles to the direction in which the wave\r\ntravels, thus causing a slight tilting of the surface. It is probable\r\nthat the waves of both phases move along curved, rather than straight,\r\nlines through the earth, that the curves are concave towards the\r\nsurface, and that the velocity of the waves increases with the depth\r\nof their path below the surface.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the surface-velocity of the first undulations of\r\nthe third phase is practically constant for all distances from the\r\nepicentre, and, in the case of the Indian earthquake, it agrees almost\r\nexactly with that obtained for the velocity within the disturbed area,\r\nand as far as Bombay. It is therefore difficult to resist the\r\nconclusion that the third phase consists of undulations which travel\r\nalong the surface of the earth. Diverging in two dimensions only, they\r\nfade away much more slowly than the vibrations of the other two\r\nphases.\r\n\r\nWe may thus imagine these surface-undulations speeding outwards from\r\nthe epicentre in ever-widening circles until they have passed over a\r\nquarter-circumference of the earth, when they should begin to converge\r\ntowards the antipodes. Here they should cross each other, and again\r\nspread out as circular waves, once more in their course passing the\r\nsame observatories where they were first recorded, but in the opposite\r\norder. It has been reserved for the most violent earthquake of modern\r\ntimes to verify this interesting conclusion. Faint, but decided, are\r\nthe traces of the second crossing. At Edinburgh, they occur at 2.6\r\nP.M., at about the same time at Shide, at Leghorn 2.10, Catania\r\n2.12-3/4, while at Ischia there are several movements between 2 and 3\r\nP.M. At Rocca di Papa, near Rome, the time is slightly earlier, but\r\nthe undulations, like those at the first crossing, have a complete\r\nperiod of about 20 seconds. The distances traversed by the waves are\r\nmore than 20,000, instead of less than 5000 miles; but the mean\r\nvelocity with which they travelled is almost exactly the same as at\r\nfirst--namely, 2.95 kilometres per second.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTH-FISSURES, SAND-VENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\n_Earth-Fissures._--Among the superficial effects of the earthquake,\r\nnone take a more important place than the fissures formed in alluvial\r\nplains. Not only were they remarkably abundant, more so than in any\r\nother known earthquake, but they occurred over an unusually wide area.\r\nWherever the necessary conditions prevailed, they were found to be\r\nnumerous over a district bounded approximately by the isoseismal 1\r\n(Fig. 68), and measuring about 400 miles from east to west, and about\r\n300 miles from north to south; and they were present, though in\r\nsmaller numbers, over an area nearly 600 miles long in an\r\neast-north-east and west-south-west direction. They were naturally\r\nmore frequent near river-channels and reservoirs, on account of the\r\nabsence of lateral support, and as a rule were parallel to the edge of\r\nthe bank, a few hundred yards in length, and in width varying from\r\nsome inches to four or five feet.\r\n\r\nFissures in such positions are formed with every violent earthquake,\r\nand even with some of those more moderate shocks that visit the\r\nBritish Islands (see p. 247). But an interesting point established by\r\nthe Indian earthquake is that they also occurred at a distance from\r\nany water-channel or excavation, often running parallel to, and along\r\neither side of, a road or embankment. In other situations, they showed\r\na distinct tendency to range themselves parallel to one another; and,\r\nin these cases, it is possible that their formation was connected with\r\nthe passage of the visible surface-waves. In an account already quoted\r\n(p. 247), it is stated that these waves came from opposite directions\r\nand that, as they separated after meeting, the ground opened slightly.\r\n\r\nAmong the Khasi and Garo hills (see Fig. 75), wherever the alluvium of\r\nthe plains runs up to the foot of the hills, another form of fissure,\r\nrepresented in Fig. 73, was constantly noticed. Close to the\r\njunction, there was a sudden drop, as at _a_, of from one to five\r\nfeet, the vertical face having the appearance of a fault, but\r\ndistinguished from one by following the windings of the hills. Then\r\ncame a depressed band _b_, from ten to twenty feet wide, and outside\r\nthis a low rounded ridge _c_ raised above its former level, and\r\nmerging beyond at _d_ into the undisturbed plain. When Mr. Oldham\r\nvisited the district in March 1898, the natives had flooded the\r\nrice-fields, and the features described were clearly depicted by the\r\ngathering of the water in the depression and the isolation of the\r\nridge.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 73.--Displacement of alluvium at foot of a\r\n   hill. (_Oldham._)]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these peculiarities is evidently that given by Mr.\r\nOldham. During the passage of repeated waves of compression, the\r\nthrust of the hill and plain against one another caused the heaping up\r\nof the alluvium in the ridge _c_; while the return movements resulted\r\nin the tearing of the alluvium away from the hillside, leaving the\r\nscarp _a_ and the depression _b._\r\n\r\n_Displacements of Alluvium._--Many other remarkable evidences of\r\ncompression were observed. Telegraph posts, originally set up in a\r\nstraight line, were displaced, occasionally as much as ten or fifteen\r\nfeet; sometimes without any apparent connection with neighbouring\r\nriver-channels. In one part of the Assam-Bengal Railway, for nearly\r\nhalf a mile, the whole embankment, including borrow-pits and trees on\r\neither side, was shifted laterally without any sign of wrenching from\r\nthe adjoining ground, the maximum distance amounting to 6-3/4 feet. As\r\nthe displacement took place parallel to the only river-course in the\r\nneighbourhood, Mr. Oldham attributes it to the sliding of the\r\nsurface-layers over some yielding bed beneath. Again, throughout large\r\nareas of Northern Bengal, Lower Assam, and Maimansingh, rice-fields,\r\nwhich had been carefully levelled so that they might be uniformly\r\nflooded, were thrown into gentle undulations, the crests of which were\r\noccasionally two or three feet above the hollows. The piers of bridges\r\nwere also moved parallel to, as well as towards, the streams, showing\r\nthat the displacements extended to the depth of the foundations.\r\n\r\nThe buckling of railway lines was often violent and took place over a\r\nlarge area. In the Charleston earthquake, every such bend was\r\naccompanied by a corresponding extension elsewhere (p. 113); but, in\r\nthe Baluchistan earthquake of 1892, the neighbouring fish-joints were\r\njammed up tight.[73] In the one case, there was merely local\r\ncompression; in the other, a permanent displacement of the earth's\r\ncrust. The distortion of the Indian lines seems to belong to the\r\nformer class. Repairs were of course generally made without delay; but\r\nall the information that could be obtained on this point showed that\r\nthe compression causing the crumpling of the lines was accompanied by\r\na compensating expansion, generally at a distance of about 300 yards.\r\n\r\n_Sand-Vents._--Shortly after the earthquake, large quantities of water\r\nand sand issued from fissures in the ground. At Dhubri, \"innumerable\r\njets of water, like fountains playing, spouted up to heights varying\r\nfrom 18 inches to quite 3-1/2 or 4 feet. Wherever this had occurred,\r\nthe land was afterwards seen to occupy a sandy circle with a\r\ndepression in its centre. These circles ranged from 2 to 6 and 8 feet\r\nin diameter, and were to be seen all over the country. In some places,\r\nseveral were quite close together; in others they were at a distance\r\nof several yards.\" Near Maimansingh, they seem to have been almost as\r\nnumerous, fifty-two, of four feet and less in diameter, being counted\r\nwithin an area 100 yards long and about 20 feet wide.\r\n\r\nThe sand and water were ejected from the vents with some force. A few\r\nobservers estimated the height of the spouts at about 12 feet, but\r\nthis probably refers to stray splashes. It is clear, however, that the\r\nsand and water were forced not only up to the surface, but even in a\r\ncontinuous stream to heights of from two to ten feet above it. In many\r\ndistricts, trunks of trees or lumps of coal and fossil resin were\r\nwashed up with the water, and even, in one or two cases, pebbles of\r\nhard rock weighing as much as half-a-pound.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the sand-vents is to be sought in the presence of a\r\nwater-bearing bed situated not far below the surface. In the central\r\narea, where there was a marked vertical component in the motion, this\r\nbed during the earthquake was compressed between those above and below\r\nit, and the resulting pressure was in places sufficient to force the\r\nwater and sand, through the fissures formed by the earthquake, up to\r\nand beyond the surface. The gradual settling of the upper layer, cut\r\nup by the fissures, into the underlying quicksand, prolonged the\r\nprocess for some time after the shock was over; and, when the pressure\r\nwas at last relieved, some of the water was sucked back and so\r\nproduced the crateriform hollows.\r\n\r\n_Rise of River-Beds, etc._--Over a large area, river-channels, tanks,\r\nwells, etc., were filled up, partly by the outpouring of the sand from\r\nvents, but chiefly, as shown by the forcing up of the central piers of\r\nbridges, by the elevation of the beds of the excavations. In the\r\nlowlands which lie between the Garo hills and the Brahmaputra, there\r\nwere numerous channels from 15 to 20 feet in depth, the beds of which\r\nwere pressed up until they became level with the banks, while a\r\ncompensating subsidence took place close to the streams on either\r\nside. The general tendency of the earthquake was thus to obliterate\r\nthe surface inequalities, so that, when the rivers rose later on, the\r\ndistrict was extensively flooded.\r\n\r\nBesides these deferred floods, there occurred immediately after the\r\nearthquake a sudden rise in many rivers, amounting to from two to ten\r\nfeet, followed by a gradual decline to the former state in two or\r\nthree days. At Gauhati, for instance, the river-gauge showed that, at\r\nabout three-quarters of an hour after the earthquake, the water stood\r\n7 feet 7 inches higher than on the morning of June 12th; at 7 A.M. on\r\nJune 13th it had fallen to 5 feet 8 inches, and at the same time on\r\nthe two following days to 2 feet 7 inches and 6 inches, showing that\r\nthe water had returned nearly to its original level after the lapse of\r\ntwo and a half days.\r\n\r\nIn most of the large rivers, the rise of water was due to the\r\nformation of partial dams formed by the local elevation of the\r\nriver-beds described above. As the barriers were composed of loose\r\nsand, they were gradually scoured away and the material was spread\r\nover the bottom so as to leave the water at a level slightly higher\r\nthan that which it maintained before the earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDSLIPS.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of landslips shows that their formation depends\r\nalmost as much on local conditions as on the violence of the shock.\r\nThe effect of the latter is manifested by their limitation to a\r\ncertain central area. To the east of the North Cachar hills, few, if\r\nany, were to be seen; but, as far as Kohima, cracks or incipient\r\nlandslips were formed on the hillsides. The Sylhet valley and a line\r\nto the west of Darjiling form the southern and western boundaries of\r\nthe landslip area, which was therefore not less than 300 miles in\r\nlength from east to west.\r\n\r\nWithin this area, however, local conditions asserted their\r\nsuperiority. Among the more important may be mentioned the\r\nconstitution of the hills and the presence of a thick superficial\r\nlayer of subsoil or rock with an inner bounding surface of weak\r\ncohesion, the slope of the hillsides, and their height from base to\r\ncrest. Thus, though the epicentral area was situated chiefly to the\r\nsouth of the Brahmaputra valley (Fig. 75), the east and west range of\r\nthe landslips was more extensive in the Himalayas on the north side\r\nthan in the Garo and Khasi hills on the south. In many places, the\r\nsteep sides of the Himalayan valleys exist always in a critical\r\ncondition of repose, and the effect of the Indian earthquake was such\r\nthat all along the north side of the Brahmaputra valley, the range is\r\nscarred by landslips, even to the east of Tezpur.\r\n\r\nAgain, along the southern edge of the Garo and Khasi hills, landslips\r\nwere unusually prevalent. \"Viewed from the deck of a steamer sailing\r\nup to Sylhet,\" says Mr. Oldham, \"the southern face of these hills\r\npresented a striking scene. The high sandstone hills facing the plains\r\nof western Sylhet, usually forest-clad from crest to foot, were\r\nstripped bare, and the white sandstone shone clear in the sun, in an\r\napparently unbroken stretch of about 20 miles in length from east to\r\nwest.\" At Cherrapunji, also, the deep valleys were so scored that,\r\nfrom a distance, there appeared to be more landslip than untouched\r\nhillside.\r\n\r\nBut in no part, probably, were landslips more strikingly developed\r\nthan in the small valley of the Mahádeo, which forms an amphitheatre\r\nabout four miles long from east to west, and a mile and a half across,\r\nlying to the south of the Bálpakrám and Pundengru hills. \"Here,\"\r\nremarks Mr. Oldham, \"everything combined to favour the formation of\r\nlandslips. The hills were composed of soft sandstone, they were\r\nsteep-sided, high, and narrow from side to side, and consequently were\r\ndoubtless thrown into actual oscillation as a whole; while the range\r\nof motion of the wave particle was not less than eight inches near the\r\nedge of the precipices. The result ... has been to produce an\r\nindescribable scene of desolation. Everywhere the hillsides facing the\r\nvalley have been stripped bare from crest to base, and the seams of\r\ncoal and partings of shale could be seen running in and out of the\r\nirregularities of the cliffs with a sharpness and distinctness which\r\nrecalled the pictures of the cañons of Colorado. At the bottom of the\r\nvalley was a piled-up heap of _débris_ and broken trees, while the old\r\nstream had been obliterated and the stream could be seen flowing over\r\na sandy bed, which must have been raised many feet above the level of\r\nthe old watercourse.\"\r\n\r\nIn the sandstone districts of the area here considered, the landslips\r\nhad some important secondary effects. Along the southern edge of the\r\nGaro and Khasi hills, great sand-fans spread over the fields, and the\r\nexposure of the hillsides formerly protected by forest left free scope\r\nfor future denudation. Every stream of any size has in this way\r\ndevastated many square miles of country. Among the hills themselves,\r\nmore sand was brought down than the streams could carry away, and\r\neverywhere their beds were raised. \"Ordinarily, the beds of these\r\nrivers, which are raging torrents when in flood, consist of a\r\nsuccession of deep pools separated by rocky rapids. After the rains of\r\n1897, it was found that the pools had been filled up, and the rapids\r\nobliterated by a great deposit of sand, over which the rivers flowed\r\nin a broad and shallow stream.\"\r\n\r\nA few valleys were for a short time barred across by landslips. In\r\none, on the northern foot of the Garo hills, a landslip crossed the\r\ndrainage channel and formed a shallow pond, which was not filled up by\r\nsand until the end of January 1898. Near Sinya, in the northern Khasi\r\nhills, an unusually large landslip formed a barrier, of which the\r\nremains are more than 200 feet above the level of the river-bed.\r\nBehind this, the water accumulated in a great lake until the beginning\r\nof September 1897, when the barrier burst and a flood of water rushed\r\ndown the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nROTATION OF PILLARS, ETC.\r\n\r\nA curious effect of earthquakes strong enough to damage buildings is\r\nthat pillars, monuments, etc., may be fractured and the upper part\r\nrotated over the lower without being overthrown. Even in Hereford and\r\nthe surrounding villages, several pinnacles and chimney-stacks were\r\ntwisted by the earthquake of 1896. The interest of the phenomenon,\r\nwhich has been known, since 1755,[74] is mainly historical, for the\r\nendeavour to discover its cause was the origin of Mallet's views on\r\nthe dynamics of earthquakes. Partly, also, it lies in the difficulty\r\nof finding a satisfactory explanation, or rather in deciding which of\r\nthree or four possible explanations is the true one in any particular\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 74.--Twisting of monument at Chhatak.\r\n   (_Oldham._)]\r\n\r\nThe Indian earthquake offered exceptional opportunities for studying\r\nthe phenomenon in the large number of examples observed and the\r\nvariety of objects rotated. None could be more striking than the\r\ntwisted monument to George Inglis, represented in outline in Fig. 74.\r\nChhatak, where this is situated, lies close to the southern boundary\r\nof the epicentral area. The monument is an obelisk, built of broad\r\nflat bricks or tiles on a base of 12 feet square, and originally more\r\nthan 60 feet high. It was split by the earthquake into four portions.\r\nThe two upper, about six and nine feet long, were thrown down; while\r\nthe third, 22 feet high, remains standing, but is twisted through an\r\nangle of 30° with respect to the lowest part, which is unmoved. The\r\nupper of these two parts had evidently rocked on the lower, as the\r\ncorners and edges were splintered, and below the fracture a slice of\r\nmasonry about 15 inches thick, which was not bonded into the main\r\nmass, was split off by the pressure on its upper end. The plan of the\r\nparts still standing is shown in the lower part of Fig. 74.\r\n\r\nThe possible explanations of the phenomenon are at least three in\r\nnumber. According to the first, which was given by Mallet in 1846, the\r\nadhesion of the twisted portion to its base is not uniform, and the\r\nresultant resistance to motion is not in the same vertical plane as\r\nthe wave-movement.[75] Some years later, Mallet offered another\r\nexplanation. The body, he imagined, might be tilted on one edge by the\r\nearthquake, and, while still rocking, a second shock oblique to the\r\nfirst might twist it about that edge.[76] In 1880, Professor T. Gray\r\nsuggested that the column might be tilted on one corner and then\r\ntwisted round it by later vibrations of the same shock.[77]\r\n\r\nNone of these theories, Mr. Oldham argues, can give by itself a\r\ncomplete explanation of the phenomena observed in the central district\r\nof the Indian earthquake; and he therefore favours an extension of the\r\nsecond theory, which, though first proposed in 1882,[78] was thought\r\nout independently and in greater detail by himself. When the focus is\r\nof considerable dimensions, the shock at neighbouring places is\r\nconstantly varying in direction, owing to the arrival of vibrations\r\nfrom different parts of the focus. Thus, instead of the two separate\r\nshocks required by Mallet's second explanation, we have a number of\r\nclosely successive impulses frequently changing in direction and\r\ngiving rise to what is known in the South of Europe as a vorticose\r\nshock. And, instead of a single twist of the pillars about one centre\r\nonly, we have a series of small twists round a number of different\r\ncentres, accompanied in consequence by a much smaller displacement of\r\nthe centre of gravity than would have occurred had the same rotation\r\nbeen accomplished in one operation.\r\n\r\nThe theory, it will be seen, accounts for the twisting of the pillar\r\nwithout overthrow, and for the splintering of the edges during the\r\nrocking of the column. It explains why in any district a number of\r\nsimilarly placed objects are generally twisted in the same direction.\r\nMoreover, a low column rocks to and fro more rapidly than a tall one\r\nsimilar in form and position, so that, at the instant when a later\r\nimpulse comes from a different direction, two such columns might\r\nhappen to be tilted on opposite edges, and would then be twisted in\r\nopposite directions. In certain cases, then, as occurred at several\r\nplaces during the Indian earthquake, an object may rotate in one\r\ndirection, while others, similar in every respect but size, may be\r\ntwisted in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER-SHOCKS.\r\n\r\n_Frequency of After-Shocks._--For some days after the great\r\nearthquake, the after-shocks by their very frequency and by their wide\r\ndistribution baffled close inquiry. During the first 24 hours,\r\nhundreds were felt at all points of the epicentral area; indeed, it is\r\nnot too much to say that for several days the ground was never\r\nactually at rest. At the Bordwar tea-estate, which is traversed by one\r\nof the great fractures to be described in the next section, the\r\nsurface of a glass of water on a table was for a whole week in a\r\nconstant state of tremor; and at Tura a hanging lamp was kept\r\ncontinually swinging for the first three or four days.\r\n\r\nMost of these shocks were, of course, very slight; but, interspersed\r\namong them, were others of greater strength, and a few of considerable\r\nviolence. One, on June 13th, about eight hours after the earthquake,\r\nwas sensible beyond Allahabad--that is, for more than 520 miles from\r\nthe epicentre; and another on the same day was felt in Calcutta,\r\ndistant 255 miles. On June 14th, 22nd, and 29th, and again on August\r\n2nd and October 9th, shocks were noticed in that city; but, after the\r\nlatter date, the disturbed area of no shock reached to so great a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nTo form any estimate of the total number of after-shocks is\r\nimpossible, even for any one station. At first, lists were kept at\r\nisolated places, such as Shillong, Maimansingh, Dhubri, and a few\r\nothers. Then, from July 15th, through Mr. Oldham's efforts, the\r\nrecords became more numerous until the end of the year, after which\r\ninterest in the subject declined. Mr. Oldham's catalogue closes with\r\nthe year 1898; but the register of a roughly-constructed seismograph,\r\nerected at Shillong in July 1897, continues to the present day.\r\n\r\nImperfect as all non-instrumental registers must be, they nevertheless\r\nfurnish some idea of the frequency of the after-shocks. Thus, until\r\nthe end of June, 679 shocks were recorded at Rangmahal (North\r\nGauhati), 135 at Maimansingh, 89 at Kuch Bihar, and 83 at Kaunia\r\n(omitting those on June 12th). Again, from August 1st to 15th, 182\r\nwere felt at Goalpara, 151 at Darangiri, 124 at Tura, 105 at Bijni, 94\r\nat Lakhipur, 94 at Krishnai, 48 at Dhubri, 28 at Rangpur, and 12 at\r\nKuch Bihar; while at Borpeta, 113 shocks were reported during the\r\nfirst nine days of August. Turning to the registers of longer\r\nduration, we find that at Maophlang (near Shillong) 1,194 shocks were\r\nfelt by one observer from September 12th, 1897, to October 7th, 1898;\r\nat the neighbouring station of Mairang, 1,065 from September 7th,\r\n1897, to December 31st, 1898; and at Tura, in the Garo hills, 1,145\r\nshocks from July 21st, 1897, to December 31st, 1898. The total number\r\nof earthquakes registered by the seismograph at Shillong from August\r\n1897 to the end of 1901 amounts to 1,274, and all of these were\r\nprobably strong enough to arouse the observer from sleep. Outside the\r\nepicentral area, Mr. Oldham's list includes 88 shocks from June 12th\r\nto July 15th, about 950 from July 16th to December 31st (the period\r\nwhen the after-shocks were most carefully observed), and 296 shocks\r\nduring the year 1898.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution of After-Shocks._--When we endeavour to\r\ncompare the lists of after-shocks at different places, we are at once\r\nmet by two serious difficulties,--the imperfection of the records and\r\nthe approximate character of the times of occurrence. Making every\r\nallowance, however, for these deficiencies, it is evident that very\r\nfew of the shocks felt at any one station were perceptible at its\r\nneighbours; in other words, that the shocks originated in a large\r\nnumber of foci scattered over a very wide area.\r\n\r\nFor instance, two of the most carefully kept registers of after-shocks\r\nare those compiled at Maophlang (near Shillong), and at Mairang, only\r\n11 miles to the north-west. Now, between September 12th and September\r\n28th, 1897 (both dates inclusive), 92 shocks were felt at Maophlang\r\nand 83 at Mairang. Of the former, 37 were described as smart, 45\r\nslight, and 10 feeble; of the latter, 6 as smart, 9 slight, 65 feeble,\r\nand 3 very feeble. But, of the total number, only 20 were felt at both\r\nplaces at recorded times that were not more than fifteen minutes\r\napart; 13 being described as smart--one at both places, one at Mairang\r\nalone, and the remaining 11 at Maophlang alone. When shocks occur so\r\nfrequently, as in these cases, it is inevitable that, even if all were\r\nindependent, some should coincide approximately in time of occurrence.\r\nIt is therefore probable that only one in every eight shocks, and\r\npossibly only one in every twelve, was felt at both places.\r\n\r\nThe actual numbers of shocks felt within stated periods at different\r\nplaces are perhaps hardly comparable, owing to the obvious\r\nimperfection of the records and the probably varying standards adopted\r\nby the reporters. But there can be little doubt that certain districts\r\nwere more subject to after-shocks than others, especially such places\r\nas North Guahati, Shillong, and neighbouring villages, Tura,\r\nDarangiri, Goalpara, Bijni, Borpeta, Kaunia, and Rangpur. On the other\r\nhand, they seem to have been unusually scarce at Dhubri and in the\r\ndistrict to the north-west, and they became rare at Gauhati long\r\nbefore they ceased to be frequent at Borpeta. In the plain to the\r\nsouth of the Garo and Khasi hills, they were also uncommon, the\r\ncombined records for Sylhet and Sonamganj for August 1-15 giving only\r\n20 shocks, and, neither to the east nor to the west of these places,\r\nis there any sign of greater frequency.\r\n\r\n_Sound-Phenomena of After-Shocks._--Many of the after-shocks were\r\naccompanied by sound, or else consisted of sound-vibrations only; and\r\nMr. Oldham notices that such sounds were equally frequent both on the\r\nrocky ground of the hills and on alluvial plains nearly all the shocks\r\nthat originated under the Borpeta plain being attended by distinctly\r\naudible rumblings.\r\n\r\nDuring his tour in the epicentral area in the winter of 1897-98, Mr.\r\nOldham had many opportunities for observing these earth-sounds. They\r\nwere, he says, close to the lower limit of audibility, less a note\r\nthan a rumble, and very like distant thunder, though sometimes they\r\nconsisted of a rapid succession of short sounds, such as is caused by\r\na cart when driven rapidly over a rough pavement. \"As a rule, they\r\nbegan as a low, almost inaudible rumble, gradually increasing in\r\nloudness, though to a very varying degree, and then gradually dying\r\nout after having lasted anything from 5 to 50 seconds. It cannot be\r\nsaid that there was any connection between the duration and the\r\nloudness of the sounds, some of the most prolonged never becoming\r\nloud, and some of those which lasted a shorter period being as loud as\r\nordinary thunder at a distance of two or three miles.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Oldham records an interesting fact in connection with the\r\ndistribution of the earth-sounds. At Naphak, in the Garo hills and\r\nabout five miles south of Samin, 48 distinct rumbles were heard during\r\n23 hours on January 21-23, 1898, only seven of them being accompanied\r\nby a perceptible shock. At Samin, which was visited next, they were\r\nmuch less frequent, not more than 8 or 10 a day, and most of them\r\nattended by tremors. At Damra, a few miles to the north-east, they\r\nagain became frequent; while, in the Chedrang valley, very few were\r\nheard, and only a small proportion of them were unaccompanied by\r\nsensible shocks. In the next section, it will be seen that the most\r\nconspicuous fault-scarps known in the epicentral area pass close by\r\nSamin and along the Chedrang valley. Thus, though the statement\r\nperhaps requires further confirmation, it would appear that\r\nearth-sounds were more common where the surface of the ground had been\r\nmerely bent than where fractures extended right up to the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE EPICENTRAL AREA.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the important features which assign the Indian\r\nearthquake to a small class apart from nearly every other shock. Most\r\nearthquakes are due to movements that are entirely deep-seated. If\r\nstrong enough, they may precipitate landslips or fissure the alluvial\r\nsoil near river-channels. In the Neapolitan, Andalusian, and\r\nCharleston earthquakes, there were many such effects of the shock\r\nwithin the meizoseismal areas. In all three, however, the disturbances\r\nproduced were superficial; no structural change, no fissuring that did\r\nnot die out rapidly downwards, was in any place perceptible. In the\r\nRiviera earthquake, the seismic sea-waves point to a small\r\ndisplacement of the ocean-bed; but it is only in the long fault-scarp\r\nof the central Japanese plain that we find a rival of the\r\nmountain-making movements that gave rise to the Indian earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of the epicentral area, to the growth of which these\r\ndistortions contributed, is represented by the curve marked A in Fig.\r\n68, and on a larger scale by the continuous line A in Fig. 75. A great\r\npart of the district is occupied by a group of hills known by various\r\nnames locally, but which are conveniently included under the general\r\nterm of the Assam range. To avoid the confusion of hill-shading, only\r\nthe boundary of the range is indicated (by the broken line) in the map\r\nin Fig. 75. The Garo hills form the western part, and the Khasi and\r\nJaintia hills the central and western parts, of the range as there\r\ndepicted. They are formed chiefly of crystalline gneissic and granitic\r\nrocks and some metamorphic schists and quarzite, with cretaceous and\r\ntertiary rocks of varying thickness along its southern edge.\r\n\r\nThree stages have been distinguished in the history of the range.\r\nDuring the earliest, an old land-surface was worn down by rain and\r\nrivers till they were almost incapable of producing any further\r\nchange. Traces of this surface are still visible in the plateau\r\ncharacter of the mass. It was then elevated, not uniformly, but along\r\na series of faults, so that it now consists of a succession of ranges,\r\nthe face of each range being a fault-scarp, and its crest the edge of\r\nan adjoining plateau sloping away from the summit. With this elevation\r\nbegan the third and last stage. The streams were able to work again,\r\nand deep gorges were cut out of the range, so that in parts its\r\noriginal character was nearly effaced. But the retention of that\r\ncharacter in other districts is of course evidence of the\r\ncomparatively recent date of the final elevation.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 75.--Epicentral Area of Indian Earthquake.\r\n   (_Oldham._)]\r\n\r\nOwing to the great size of the epicentre and to the thickness of the\r\nforests which cover so much of its area, a comparatively small part of\r\nit could be traversed by Mr. Oldham during his tour in the winter of\r\n1897-98. The positions of the more important structural changes are\r\nindicated in Fig. 75. Of these, the fault-scarps are represented by\r\ncontinuous straight lines, the Bordwar fracture by the dotted straight\r\nline, pools and lakes not due to faulting by black ovals, reported\r\nchanges in the aspects of the hills by circles, and the principal\r\nstations of the revised trigonometrical survey by crosses.\r\n\r\n_Fault-Scarps._--The most important fault-scarp is that called by Mr.\r\nOldham the Chedrang fault, after the stream which coincides roughly\r\nwith a great part of its course. The longer straight line in Fig. 75\r\nrepresents its position and general direction, and the sketch-map in\r\nFig. 76 gives the plan of its southern half. From these, it will be\r\nseen that the fault follows on the whole a nearly straight path from\r\nsouth-south-east to north-north-west for not less than twelve miles,\r\nand that its throw, as indicated by the numbers to the right in Fig.\r\n76; is very variable, being zero in some places, and in one as much as\r\n35 feet or more. The upthrow is uniformly on the eastern side of the\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nAt its southern end, as mapped in Fig. 76, there is no perceptible\r\nthrow at the surface, but various marks of violence are manifested in\r\nthe fissuring of the hillside and the snapping of small trees. About a\r\nquarter of a mile from this point, the fault crosses a tributary\r\nstream, where the throw amounts to two feet, and the same distance\r\nfarther on it meets the Chedrang river, the bed of which it crosses\r\nmany times in its short course.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 76.--Plan of Chedrang fault. (_Oldham._)]\r\n\r\nMr. Oldham describes the fault in detail, as observed by him in\r\nFebruary 1898. Here, it will be sufficient to refer to its more\r\nimportant features, and to its effects on the superficial drainage of\r\nthe district. At the spot marked _a_ (Fig. 76) the river, after\r\nrunning on the west or down-throw side of the fault for nearly half a\r\nmile, meets the scarp, and is ponded back by it for about a quarter of\r\na mile upstream. For the next half-mile, the river keeps to the\r\nupthrow side of the fault, the scarp of which blocks the tributary\r\nstreams from the west, forming a number of small pools. At the last of\r\nthese, the total throw is not less than 25 feet. A little farther on,\r\nthe fault crosses the Chedrang and causes the waterfall at _b_, the\r\nheight of which, owing to the fall of dislodged fragments, does not\r\nexceed nine feet. The fault then runs along the old and now dry bed of\r\nthe river, while the stream itself flows in a depression on the\r\ndown-throw side. About a quarter of a mile below the waterfall, the\r\nfault crosses the river, and soon after enters a large sheet of water\r\nat _c_, half a mile long, from 300 to 400 yards wide, and with a\r\nmaximum depth of 18 feet. At first, the pool spreads on both sides of\r\nthe fault, but the inequalities due to the scarp are evidenced by\r\nsoundings. At the point where the fault leaves the pool, its throw is\r\nreduced to nothing, and it is just here that the water attains its\r\ngreatest depth. To the north the throw increases rather rapidly, to 25\r\nfeet in a quarter of a mile. But the peculiarity of this pool is that\r\nit is not, like the others mentioned above, dammed back by the\r\nfault-scarp. There is no barrier at its northern end, where the river\r\nescapes, except that formed by the gradually increasing throw of the\r\nfault. The pool is simply due to the reversal of the natural slope of\r\nthe river-bed, caused by the formation of a roll or undulation in the\r\nground on the upthrow side of the fault. Its recent origin is evident\r\nfrom the number of dead trees and bamboo clumps still standing in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nFor a mile after the fault leaves the pool, its throw varies\r\nconsiderably. It rises, as already mentioned, from zero to 25 feet. A\r\nlittle farther on, the fault runs up the side of a spur, the throw\r\nincreasing to 31 feet; and, in this part, the violence of the shock\r\nwas shown by the dislodgment of blocks of granite as much as 20 feet\r\nin diameter, and by the overthrow or destruction of many trees. After\r\ncrossing the spur, the fault returns to the neighbourhood of the\r\nriver, and crosses its bed four times, forming pools (_e_, _g_) or\r\nwaterfalls (_d_, _f_) according as the scarp occurs on the downstream\r\nor upstream side. The throw of the fault then changes considerably\r\nwithin little more than half a mile, from 18 feet to zero and again to\r\n20 feet, the undulation so formed producing a large pool (_h_)\r\nentirely on the upthrow side of the fault.\r\n\r\nAt the point marked _i_ on the map, the river once more crosses the\r\nfault; but the bottom of the valley is filled with alluvium, and,\r\ninstead of a waterfall, a large sandy delta spreads down the stream.\r\nThe scarp is, however, readily traced on the east side of the river, a\r\nthrow of 32 feet being measured. After this, the alluvium becomes of\r\nconsiderable thickness, and the continuation of the fault is marked by\r\na short slope, which tilts over the trees when it traverses\r\nforest-land. Leaving the valley of the Chedrang, the fault crosses an\r\nopen plain, and is followed with some difficulty to the neighbourhood\r\nof Jhira, where, owing to the thick bed of alluvium, it forms a gentle\r\nroll or undulation of the surface, crossing the main channel of the\r\nKrishnai to the north-east of Jhira. On the west side of this barrier\r\na large sheet of water, a mile and a half in length, three-quarters of\r\na mile wide, and 12 feet in depth, gathered over the village of Jhira.\r\n\"On the east side of the Jhira lake,\" says Mr. Oldham, \"there is ample\r\nevidence of change of level, for part of the dry land was formerly ...\r\nperpetually under water, and at one place the remains of an old\r\nirrigation channel can be seen.... At the northern end of the lake the\r\ndrainage now makes its escape in a broad and shallow sheet of water\r\nover what was once high land covered with _sal_ forest.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the last marked feature due to the Chedrang fault. Beyond the\r\nnorth of Jhira the throw rapidly diminishes, and perhaps dies out\r\naltogether before reaching the low hills lying to the north of that\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nIn several ways, this fault-scarp differs from that formed with the\r\nJapanese earthquake of 1891. Throughout its course the down-throw,\r\nwherever it is perceptible, is invariably to the west; in no place\r\ncould any trace of horizontal shifting be detected; and the plane of\r\nthe fault, when it traversed rock, is practically vertical.\r\n\r\nWhether the scarp was formed by the elevation of the rock to the east\r\nof the fault, or by the depression of that to the west, or by both\r\nsuch movements at once, there is no decisive evidence; but there are\r\nvery good reasons for believing the first alternative to be the true\r\none. The undulations in the ground which gave rise to the large pools\r\nat _c_ and _h_ (Fig. 76) occur on the east side of the fault. Also,\r\nbetween the outlet of the lake at Jhira and the point where the\r\nKrishnai rejoins its original channel, the gradient of the river\r\napproaches that of a mountain stream, although the new bed consists of\r\nalluvium, and not of rock. Now, the alluvial plain of this district is\r\nraised so slightly above the sea-level that no subsidence great enough\r\nto have caused the existing gradient could have occurred without the\r\ndepressed area being flooded with water. Though some movements may\r\nhave taken place on the west side of the fault, it seems clear, then,\r\nthat elevation of the rock on the east side was the predominant, if\r\nnot the sole, cause of the fault-scarp.\r\n\r\nAs the Chedrang fault has been described somewhat fully, a brief\r\nreference to the rest will be sufficient The only other known scarp of\r\nany consequence lies about ten miles to the south of the Chedrang\r\nfault, and runs by the village of Samin, with an average course from\r\nE. 30° S. to W. 30° N. Its total length does not exceed 2-1/2 miles.\r\nThe down-throw is uniformly to the north, and the throw, which\r\namounts to ten feet near its centre, gradually diminishes to zero at\r\neither end. Several pools are formed along the course of the\r\nfault-scarp by the blocking of small streams.\r\n\r\n_The Bordwar Fracture._--In the map of the epicentral area (Fig. 75),\r\nthis remarkable fracture is represented by a dotted straight line. It\r\nis apparently an incipient fault. Though traceable for a distance of\r\nabout seven miles, at no point is there any decisive evidence of\r\neither vertical or horizontal displacement; and, even if some doubtful\r\nindications of a change of level should be real, the throw must\r\ncertainly be less than one foot. Yet, in the immediate neighbourhood\r\nof the fracture, the violence of the shock was extreme. \"Trees have\r\nbeen overthrown or killed as they stood; a huge mass of rock,\r\ndislodged from near the crest of the hills, has rolled down the slope,\r\nscoring the side of the hill. On the opposite side an equally large\r\nblock has been dislodged, and in its downward course cleared a\r\nstraight track down the hill; and on the summit a gap has been cleared\r\nby the overthrow of trees along the line of fracture.\" Being only a\r\nfew inches in width where it has rent the solid rock, the fracture was\r\ndifficult to follow in many parts of its course. But, through\r\nforest-clad land, its track was marked by \"a well-defined band of\r\nabout half a mile broad, in which overturned trees are much more\r\nabundant than on either side, and towards the centre of this band the\r\noverturned trees are not only more numerous, but many of the smaller\r\nones, up to six inches in diameter, have been snapped across by the\r\nviolence of the shock.\"\r\n\r\n_Lakes and Pools not due to Faulting._--A few miles to the south of\r\nthe Chedrang and Samin faults, and also of the Bordwar fracture,\r\noccurs a group of lakes or pools, represented on the map of the\r\nepicentral area (Fig. 75) by small black ovals. In the gradual\r\nincrease in depth from either end, they resemble the two large sheets\r\nof water along the course of the Chedrang fault (_c_ and _h_, Fig.\r\n76), but they differ from them in having no direct connection with any\r\napparent fault.\r\n\r\nOne of these pools lies in the valley of the Rongtham river, to the\r\nsouth of the Samin fault. It seemed, at first sight, to be nothing\r\nmore than an ordinary pool, such as may be seen on any mountain\r\nstream. On the bottom, and close to the outlet, however, are coarse,\r\npartially rounded boulders, exactly resembling those farther down the\r\nriver; and, as the old bed was followed up, these became coated with a\r\nslight deposit of sand and mud, pointing clearly to a change in the\r\nconditions under which they were formed. The water gradually deepened,\r\nuntil trees were met standing in the water, but killed by the recent\r\nsubmergence of their roots. The pool is nearly a quarter of a mile\r\nlong, and its greatest depth (12 feet) occurs near the middle, just\r\nwhere the former stream, with an average depth of about a foot, was\r\ncrossed by the track from Darangiri. Towards the upper end, the water\r\nshallows as gradually as it deepens at the other, and ends in a delta\r\nof boulders brought down by the stream above. As no fault could be\r\ndiscovered in the neighbourhood of the pool, it is evident that its\r\nformation was due to a bend of the river-bed, the maximum change of\r\nlevel, taking into account the river-slope, being not less than 24\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nSimilar features characterise the other pools that were examined, some\r\nof which are smaller, and others larger, than that described above.\r\nOne, higher up the valley of the Rongtham, has a length of about 1-1/2\r\nmile and a maximum depth of 18 feet. Others of the same type, but of\r\nsmaller size, were observed among the Khasi hills, about fifteen miles\r\nsouth of the Bordwar fissure; and it is probable that many others\r\nwould have been found in the intermediate district, which Mr. Oldham\r\nwas unable to visit.\r\n\r\n_Changes in the Aspects of the Hills._--There are, again, other facts\r\nof considerable interest which point to changes of level over a wide\r\narea; the places where they were noticed being indicated by small\r\ncircles in Fig. 75. For instance, from Maophlang, near Shillong, a\r\nroad leads to the neighbouring station of Mairang. Before the\r\nearthquake, only a short stretch of this road could be seen from the\r\nformer place, as it rounded a spur about three miles away. Now, a much\r\nlonger stretch is visible, and it can also be seen passing round the\r\nnext, and previously hidden, spur. In this district the movements seem\r\nto have continued with the after-shocks; for, before the earthquake,\r\nthe crest only of a ridge about a mile and a half to the west was\r\nvisible; while, after it, a considerable portion could be seen, and\r\nmuch more some months later than immediately after the shock.\r\n\r\nAgain, from a spot near the southern end of the Chedrang fault, it\r\nused to be only just possible to see the Brahmaputra over an\r\nintervening hill; whereas, now, the whole width of the river has come\r\ninto view.\r\n\r\nLastly, at Tura, which is 95 miles west of Maophlang, a battalion of\r\nmilitary police were accustomed to signal by heliograph with another\r\nstation, Rowmari, 15 miles farther to the west. This, formerly, could\r\njust be done by means of a ray which grazed a hill between the two\r\nplaces; it can now be done quite easily, and, in addition, a broad\r\nstretch of the plains east of the Brahmaputra is visible from the same\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n_Revision of the Trigonometrical Survey._--The movements described in\r\nthe preceding pages are of course referred to points which may\r\nthemselves have been displaced, and only a revision of the\r\ntrigonometrical survey of the epicentral area and of part of the\r\nsurrounding district could determine their absolute magnitude. During\r\nthe cold weather of 1897-98, some of the triangles were re-measured by\r\na member of the trigonometrical survey; but, as the time at his\r\ndisposal was short, they were confined to the eastern part of the\r\nepicentral area, as the focus at that time was supposed to lie under\r\nthe Khasi hills. The positions of some of these stations are indicated\r\nby crosses in Fig. 75; and in Fig. 77 the more important triangles are\r\nshown. In the revised work, all tower stations, consisting of brick\r\ntowers built on alluvium, were omitted, as it could not be assumed\r\nthat they had been undisturbed by displacements of the superficial\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\nIn re-calculating the lengths of the sides, the side\r\nRangsanobo-Taramun Tila was adopted as the initial base, and the\r\nheight of Rangsanobo as the initial height; a choice which later\r\nexperience showed to be unfortunate, for Taramun Tila probably lies\r\njust outside, and Rangsanobo within, the epicentral area. Of the 16\r\nsides, whose old and new lengths were compared, only one was found to\r\nbe apparently unchanged, two were shortened by an inch or two, while\r\nthe others were all lengthened by amounts varying from one to eight\r\nor nine feet, the numbers affixed to the sides in Fig. 77 denoting the\r\ncalculated increases in feet. Assuming the new base-line to be\r\nunaltered by the earthquake movements, these changes imply the\r\nfollowing displacements of the principal stations:--Thanjinath 6 feet,\r\nMun 4, and Laidera 2, feet to the north; Mopen 5, Dinghei 9, Landau\r\nModo 12, and Umter 11, feet to the north-west; and Mosingi 3, and\r\nMautherrican 5, feet to the west. At the same time, the height of\r\nmost of the stations was found to be increased with reference to that\r\nof Rangsanobo: Mun by 2 feet, Thanjinath and Umter by 3, Mosingi by 4,\r\nTaramun Tila and Laidera by 6, Dinghei by 7, Landau Modo by 17, and\r\nMautherrican by 24, feet; while the height of Mopen seems to have been\r\ndiminished by 4 feet. Thus, at first sight, these calculations appear\r\nto indicate \"a general elevation and extension of the hills, such as\r\nmight follow on a bulging upwards of the surface due to the extension\r\nof a large mass of molten matter underground.\"\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 77.--Re-triangulation of Khasi hills.\r\n   (_Oldham._)]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as Mr. Oldham shows, a very different, and more\r\nprobable, interpretation may be given of these results; for all the\r\ncalculated changes are rendered uncertain by the choice of the two\r\nstations which form the ends of the new base-line. One at least may\r\nhave been displaced by the structural movements within the epicentral\r\narea; and, moreover, the line joining them runs nearly north and\r\nsouth. As compression in this direction is to be expected, it is\r\nprobable that this line was shortened; and the assumption that its\r\nlength was unchanged would therefore lead to an apparent expansion of\r\nall the other sides.\r\n\r\nThe calculated changes seem to favour this explanation to a great\r\nextent. The sides joining Mopen, Rangsanobo, and Thanjinath run nearly\r\neast and west, and are apparently lengthened by 4.9 and 3.4 feet\r\nrespectively; while, of the four sides joining these stations to\r\nMosingi and Mun, lying next to the north, two are nearly or quite\r\nunchanged, and the others increased by 2.3 and 3.2 feet. Again, the\r\nestimated increase of the Mosingi-Mun line is 4.4 feet; while the four\r\nsides joining these stations to the next northerly group are\r\nincreased by small amounts--namely, 1.2, 2.6,-0.3, and 2.4 feet. Thus,\r\nthe apparent expansion that should have occurred in these more or less\r\nnortherly sides is lessened, or roughly compensated, probably by a\r\ncompression of the whole region in a meridianal direction.\r\n\r\nFor a similar reason, the slight general upheaval of the hills\r\nindicated by the repeated calculations, must be regarded as doubtful,\r\nfor it depends on the assumed fixity of the station of Rangsanobo,\r\nwhereas it is more probable that it was the height of Taramun Tila\r\nthat remained unchanged. Reducing the calculated heights of all the\r\nother stations by six feet (the assumed rise of the latter), it\r\nfollows that, on the whole, the height of the Khasi hills underwent\r\nbut little change, except at Mautherrican and Landau Modo, and the\r\nsecondary stations of Mairang and Kollong Rock, near Maonoi. The\r\napparent elevations of 24, 17, 11, and 15 feet at these places exceed\r\nthe probable error of the observations; and it is worthy of notice\r\nthat all four stations lie close to the edge of fault-scarps, while\r\nLandau Modo is not far from two of the pools formed by distortion of\r\nthe surface unaccompanied by faulting.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the revised triangulation of the Khasi hills has failed to\r\nprovide absolute measures of the displacements in the epicentral area,\r\nit has, nevertheless, proved that important movements, both horizontal\r\nand vertical, have taken place.\r\n\r\n_Distribution of the Structural Changes._--The boundary of the\r\nepicentral area, as drawn in Figs. 68 and 75, lays no claim to great\r\naccuracy; but its departure from the true line is probably in no place\r\nconsiderable. It must evidently include all the districts where\r\nmarked structural changes occurred, and must therefore extend east of\r\nMaophlang and west of Tura. Towards the north, these changes have been\r\ntraced to the foot of the Garo hills, and there is some, though not\r\nvery certain, evidence of alterations of level along the course of the\r\nBrahmaputra. The very large number of after-shocks recorded at Borpeta\r\nand Bijni also points to an extension of the epicentral area beyond\r\nthese places. To the east, the course of the boundary becomes\r\ndoubtful, but it must pass close to Gauhati and east of Shillong, and\r\nprobably ends a short distance beyond Jaintiapur. The southern\r\nboundary must coincide nearly with the north edge of the alluvial\r\nplains of Sylhet, for there is no evidence of its intrusion into the\r\nplains. On the west side, the epicentral area includes the Garo hills\r\nand part of the alluvial plain to the west; and, from the large number\r\nof after-shocks felt at Rangpur and Kaunia, and the great violence of\r\nthe shock at the former, we may infer that both places lie within the\r\nboundary-line. If, then, there is no great error in the mapping of\r\nthis line, it follows that the epicentre was about 200 miles long from\r\neast to west, not less than 50, and possibly as much as 100, miles in\r\nmaximum width, and contained an area of at least 6000 square miles.\r\n\r\nNear the boundary, the permanent displacements must have been\r\ncomparatively small; but they were certainly marked in the northern\r\npart of the Assam hills for a distance of 100 miles from east to west.\r\nAt the limits of the latter area, as Mr. Oldham remarks, \"the evidence\r\npoints to the changes being of the nature of long, low rolls, the\r\nchange of slope being insufficient to cause any appreciable change in\r\nthe drainage channels. Then comes a zone in which the surface changes\r\nare more abrupt, the slopes of the stream beds have been altered so as\r\nto cause conspicuous changes in the nature of the streams, but any\r\nfracture or faulting which may have taken place has died out before\r\nthe surface was reached. And north of this, close to the edge of the\r\nhills, the rocks have been fractured and faulted right up to the\r\nsurface.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nAlmost every feature of the great earthquake points to an origin very\r\ndifferent from that of the others described in this volume. The\r\nsuddenness with which the shock began, its unusual duration, and the\r\noccurrence of many maxima of intensity, are inconsistent with a simple\r\nfault-displacement. Again, the excessive velocities of projection at\r\nRambrai and elsewhere, the existence of isolated fault-scarps and\r\nfractures, the local changes of level, the compression indicated by\r\nthe revised trigonometrical survey, the wide area over which these\r\nstructural changes took place, and the numerous distinct centres of\r\nsubsequent activity, all these phenomena demonstrate the intense and\r\ncomplex character of the initial disturbances, as well as the\r\nwidespread bodily displacement of the earth's crust within the\r\nepicentral area. There may, it is conceivable, have been a number of\r\nfoci, nearly or quite detached from one another, and giving rise to a\r\ngroup of nearly concurrent shocks. Or--and this is a far more probable\r\nsupposition--there may have been one vast deep-seated centre, from\r\nwhich off-shoots ran up towards the surface, each partaking to a\r\ngreater or less degree in the movement within the parent focus.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Oldham points out, we have recently become acquainted with a\r\nstructure exactly corresponding to that which is here inferred. The\r\ngreat thrust-planes, so typically developed in the Scottish Highlands,\r\nare only reversed faults which are nearly horizontal instead of being\r\nhighly inclined; and they are accompanied by a number of ordinary\r\nreversed faults running upwards to the surface. In Fig. 78, the main\r\nfeatures of a section drawn by the Geological Survey of Scotland are\r\nreproduced; T, T, representing thrust planes, and _t_, _t_, minor\r\nthrusts or faults. A great movement along one of the main\r\nthrust-planes would carry with it dependent slips along many of the\r\nsecondary planes. Direct effects of the former might be invisible at\r\nthe surface, except in the horizontal displacements that would be\r\nrendered manifest by a renewed trigonometrical survey; whereas the\r\nlatter might or might not reach the surface, giving rise in the one\r\ncase to fissures and fault-scarps, in the other to local changes of\r\nlevel, and in both to regions of instability resulting in numerous\r\nafter-shocks.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 78.--Diagram of Thrust-planes.]\r\n\r\nThe enormous dimensions of the parent focus will be obvious from the\r\nphenomena that have been described above. Mr. Oldham has traced the\r\nprobable form of the epicentre. It may in reality be neither so\r\nsimple nor so symmetrical as is represented in Fig. 75, but there are\r\ngood reasons for thinking that it does not differ sensibly either in\r\nsize or form from that laid down. The part of the thrust-plane over\r\nwhich movement took place must therefore have been about 200 miles\r\nlong, not less than 50 miles wide, and between 6000 and 7000 square\r\nmiles in area. With regard to its depth, we have no decisive\r\nknowledge. It may have been about five miles or less; it can hardly\r\nhave been much greater.\r\n\r\nIt is a strain on the imagination to try and picture the displacement\r\nof so huge a mass. We may think, if we will, of a slice of rock three\r\nor four miles in thickness and large enough to reach from Dover to\r\nExeter in one direction and from London to Brighton in the other; not\r\nslipping intermittently in different places, but giving way almost\r\ninstantaneously throughout its whole extent; crushing all before it,\r\nboth solid rock and earthy ground alike; and, whether by the sudden\r\nspring of the entire mass or by the jar of its hurtling fragments,\r\nshattering the strongest work of human hands as easily as the\r\nfrailest. Such a thrust might well be sensible over half a continent,\r\nand give rise to undulations which, unseen and unfelt, might wend\r\ntheir way around the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.\r\n\r\n  1.

At\r\nLivorno, the first movements were registered by seismographs at 11.17\r\nA.M. (G.M.T.), and tremors were noticed by some persons at rest at\r\nabout 11.15 A.M. At Spinea, a sensible undulatory shock from\r\nsouth-east to north-west, and lasting about four seconds, was felt at\r\nthe moment when all the seismographs were set in motion by the Indian\r\nearthquake.

Few shocks have\r\ncontributed more to our knowledge than the majority of those described\r\nin this volume; but, on certain points, we gain additional information\r\nfrom the investigation of other earthquakes, and these are referred to\r\nwhen necessary for the purpose in view.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORE-SHOCKS.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, we are met by a question of some interest and great\r\npractical importance--namely, whether there are any constant signs of\r\nthe coming of great earthquakes by means of which their occurrence\r\nmight be predicted and their disastrous effects mitigated.\r\n\r\nExcluding the Ischian earthquakes, which belong to a special class, it\r\nis evident that there is generally some slight preparation for a great\r\nearthquake. For a few hours or days beforehand, weak shocks and\r\ntremors are felt or rumbling noises heard within the future\r\nmeizoseismal area. But, unfortunately, it has not yet been found\r\npossible to distinguish these disturbances from others of apparently\r\nthe same character which occur alone, so that for the present they\r\nfail to serve as warnings.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, where the organisation of earthquake-studies is more\r\ncomplete than elsewhere, it is possible that a vague forecast might be\r\nmade, if the distribution of the fore-shocks of the earthquake of 1891\r\nshould prove to be a general feature of all great earthquakes. It was\r\nat first supposed that this earthquake occurred without preparation of\r\nany kind; but a closer analysis of the records shows that during the\r\nprevious two years there was a very decided increase in the seismic\r\nactivity of the district, and also that the distribution of the\r\nepicentres marked out the future fault-scarp, and at the same time\r\nexhibited a tendency to comparative uniformity over the whole\r\nfault-region.\r\n\r\nFor the present, then, the only warning available is that given by the\r\npreliminary sound, which may precede the strongest vibrations by as\r\nmuch as five or ten or even more seconds. Though two or three seconds\r\nmay elapse before its character is recognised, the fore-sound thus\r\nallows time for many persons to escape from their falling houses. Some\r\nraces, however, are less capable of hearing the sound than others, and\r\nthis may be one reason why Japanese earthquakes are so destructive of\r\nhuman life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTURBED AREA.\r\n\r\nIt is usual with some investigators to measure the intensity of an\r\nearthquake roughly by the extent of its disturbed area. The depth of\r\nthe seismic focus must of course have some influence on the size of\r\nthis area, and this condition is only neglected because we have no\r\nprecise knowledge of the depth in any case. Thus, Mr. Oldham regards\r\nthe Indian earthquake of 1897 as rivalling the Lisbon earthquake of\r\n1755, which is generally considered to hold the first place, because\r\nits disturbed area was not certainly exceeded by that of the latter.\r\n\r\nThat disturbed area is, however, an untrustworthy measure of intensity\r\nwill be evident from the following table, in which the earthquakes\r\ndescribed in this volume (omitting those of Ischia) are arranged as\r\nnearly as may be in order of intensity, beginning with the\r\nstrongest:--\r\n\r\n    Earthquake.            Disturbed Area\r\n                           in Sq. Miles.\r\n\r\n    Indian                   1,750,000\r\n    Japanese                   330,000\r\n    Neapolitan                  39,200\r\n    Charleston               2,800,000\r\n    Riviera                    219,000\r\n    Andalusian                 174,000\r\n    Hereford                    98,000\r\n    Inverness                   33,000\r\n\r\nHere we see that the Charleston earthquake was perceptible over a\r\ngreater area than the Indian earthquake, while the Neapolitan\r\nearthquake was inferior to that of Hereford in this respect. The\r\nexplanation of course is that the boundaries of the disturbed areas\r\nare isoseismal lines corresponding to different degrees of intensity,\r\nthe inhabitants of Great Britain and the United States being evidently\r\nmore sensitive to weak tremors, or more observant, than those of\r\nItaly, Spain, or Central Asia. The only disturbed areas that are\r\nbounded by isoseismals of the same intensity are the two last. Very\r\nroughly, then, we may say that the intensity of the Hereford\r\nearthquake was three times as great as that of the Inverness\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE EPICENTRE.\r\n\r\nOne of the first objects in the investigation of an earthquake is to\r\ndetermine the position and form of the epicentre. In a few rare cases,\r\nas in the Japanese and Indian earthquakes, when the fault-scarp is\r\nleft protruding at the surface, only careful mapping is required to\r\nascertain both data. But, in the great majority of earthquakes, the\r\nfault-slip dies out before reaching the surface and the position of\r\nthe epicentre is then inferred by methods depending chiefly on the\r\ntime of occurrence or on the direction or intensity of the shock.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, methods that involve the time of occurrence at\r\ndifferent places seem to be of considerable promise. No scientific\r\ninstruments are so widely diffused as clocks and watches; but, on the\r\nother hand, few are so carelessly adjusted. It is the exception,\r\nrather than the rule, to find a time-record accurate to the nearest\r\nminute; and, as small errors in the time may be of consequence,\r\nmethods depending on this element of the earthquake are seldom\r\nemployed. If, however, the number of observations is large for the\r\nsize of the disturbed area, the construction of coseismal lines may\r\ndefine approximately the position of the epicentre. In the Hereford\r\nearthquake of 1896, the centre of the innermost coseismal line (Fig.\r\n62) is close to the region lying between the two epicentres.\r\n\r\nThe method of locating the epicentre by means of the intersection of\r\ntwo or more lines of direction of the shock was first suggested by\r\nMichell in 1760,[79] and has been employed by Mallet in investigating\r\nthe Neapolitan earthquake, by Professors Taramelli and Mercalli in\r\ntheir studies of the Andalusian and Riviera earthquakes, as well as by\r\nother seismologists. The diversity of apparent directions at one and\r\nthe same place caused its temporary neglect, until Professor Omori\r\nshowed in 1894 that the mean of a large number of measurements gives a\r\ntrustworthy result (p. 19). His interesting observations should\r\nreinstate the method to its former place among the more valuable\r\ninstruments at the disposal of the seismologist.\r\n\r\nNo observations, however, are at present so valuable for the purpose\r\nin view as those made on the intensity of the shock. For many years,\r\nit has been the custom to regard the epicentre as coincident with the\r\narea of greatest damage to buildings; and, when the area is small, the\r\nassumption cannot be much in error. It is of course merely a rough way\r\nof obtaining a result that is generally given more accurately by means\r\nof isoseismal lines; but there are exceptional cases, such as the\r\nNeapolitan and Ischian earthquakes, when the destruction wrought by\r\nthe earthquake furnishes evidence of the greater value.\r\n\r\nA single isoseismal accurately drawn not only gives the position of\r\nthe epicentre with some approach to exactness, but also by the\r\ndirection of its longer axis determines that of the originating fault.\r\nWhen two or three such lines can be traced, the relative position\r\nsupplies in addition the hade of the fault (p. 219). The successful\r\napplication of the method requires, it is true, a large number of\r\nobservations, and these cannot as a rule be obtained except in\r\ndistricts that are somewhat thickly and uniformly populated, such as\r\nthose surrounding the cities of Hereford and Inverness. In the\r\nCharleston earthquake, also, the position and form of the epicentres\r\nwere deduced from the trend of isoseismal lines based on the damage to\r\nrailway-lines and various structures within a sparsely inhabited\r\nmeizoseismal area.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases, of which the Indian earthquake may be regarded as\r\ntypical, a fourth method has recently been found of service. The\r\nnumerous after-shocks which follow a great earthquake originate for\r\nthe most part within the seismic focus of the latter; and, as they\r\nusually disturb a very small area, it is not difficult to ascertain\r\napproximately the positions of their epicentres. Some, as in the\r\nInverness after-shocks of 1901, result from slips in the very margin\r\nof the principal focus; but, as a rule, the seat of their activity\r\ntends to contract towards a central region of the focus. Bearing in\r\nmind, then, that some of the succeeding shocks originate at and beyond\r\nthe confines of the focus, and that others may be sympathetic shocks\r\nprecipitated by the sudden change of stress, it follows that the\r\nshifting epicentres of the true after-shocks map out, in part at any\r\nrate, the epicentral area of the principal earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF THE SEISMIC FOCUS.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that we have no satisfactory method of\r\ndetermining so interesting an element as the depth of the seismic\r\nfocus. That it amounts to but a few miles at the most is certain from\r\nthe limited areas within which slight shocks are felt or disastrous\r\nones exhibit their maximum effects. Nor can we suppose that the rocks\r\nat very great depths are capable of offering the prolonged resistance\r\nand sudden collapse under stress that are necessary for the production\r\nof an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe problem is evidently beyond our present powers of solution, and\r\nits interest is therefore mainly historical. All the known methods are\r\nvitiated by our ignorance of the refractive powers of the rocks\r\ntraversed by the earth-waves. But, even if this ignorance could be\r\nreplaced by knowledge, most of the methods suggested are open to\r\nobjection. Falb's method, depending on the time-interval between the\r\ninitial epochs of the sound and shock, is of more than doubtful value.\r\nDutton's, based on the rate of change of surface-intensity, is\r\ndifficult to apply, and in any case gives only an inferior limit to\r\nthe depth. Time-observations have been employed, especially in New\r\nZealand; but the uncertainty in selecting throughout the same phase of\r\nthe movement, and the large errors in the estimated depth resulting\r\nfrom small errors in the time-records, are at present most serious\r\nobjections. There remains the method devised by Mallet, and, though he\r\nclaimed for it an exaggerated accuracy, it still, in my opinion, holds\r\nthe field against all its successors. When carefully applied, as it\r\nhas been by Mallet himself, by Johnston-Lavis and Mercalli, we\r\nprobably obtain at least some conception of the depth of the seismic\r\nfocus.\r\n\r\nProfessor Omori and Mr. K. Hirata have recently[80] lessened the chief\r\ndifficulty in the application of Mallet's method. They have deduced\r\nthe angle of emergence from the vertical and horizontal components of\r\nthe motion as registered by seismographs, instead of from the\r\ninclination of fissures in damaged walls. In two recent earthquakes\r\nrecorded at Miyako in Japan, they find the angle of emergence to be\r\n7.2° and 9° respectively, the corresponding depths of the foci being\r\n5.6 and 9.3 miles. These are probably the most accurate estimates that\r\nwe possess, and it will be noted that they differ little from the mean\r\nvalues obtained for the Neapolitan, Andalusian, and Riviera\r\nearthquakes--namely, 6.6, 7.6, and 10.8 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SHOCK\r\n\r\nIn one respect, the earthquakes described above fail to represent the\r\nprogress of modern seismology. They furnish no diagrams made by\r\naccurately constructed seismographs within their disturbed areas. The\r\ncurve reproduced in Fig. 36, as already pointed out, is no exception\r\nto this statement. For another reason, the records that were obtained\r\nin Japan of the earthquake of 1891 are trustworthy for little more\r\nthan the short-period initial vibrations; for, owing to the passage of\r\nthe surface-waves, visible in and near the meizoseismal area, the\r\nJapanese seismographs registered the tilting of the ground rather than\r\nthe elastic vibrations that traversed the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this defect, personal impressions of an\r\nearthquake-shock give a fairly accurate, if incomplete, idea of its\r\nnature. Nearly all observers placed under favourable conditions agree\r\nthat an earthquake begins with a deep rumbling sound, accompanied,\r\nafter the first second or two, by a faint tremor which gradually, and\r\nsometimes rapidly, increases in strength until it merges into the\r\nshock proper, which consists of several or many vibrations of larger\r\namplitude and longer period, and during which the attendant sound is\r\ngenerally at its loudest; the earthquake dying away, as it began, with\r\ntremors and a low rumbling sound.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 79.--Seismographic Record of Tokio Earthquake\r\n   of 1894. (_Omori._)]\r\n\r\nThe vibrations that produce the sensible shock are by no means all\r\nthat are present during an earthquake. The Indian earthquake, for\r\ninstance, seemed to last about three or four minutes at Midnapur; but\r\nthe movements of the bubble of a level showed that the ground\r\ncontinued to oscillate for at least five minutes longer (p. 280). Many\r\nof these unfelt waves are rendered manifest by seismographs, although\r\nthere are still others that elude registration either from the extreme\r\nshortness or the great length of their periods.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 79 is shown the principal part of a diagram obtained at Tokio\r\nduring the Japanese earthquake of June 20th, 1894 (p. 18), the curve\r\nrepresenting the N.E.-S.W. component of the horizontal motion during\r\nthe first 25 seconds of the record. The instrument employed is one\r\nspecially designed for registering strong earthquakes, and is\r\nunaffected by very minute tremors. Those which formed the commencement\r\nof this earthquake lasted for about 10 seconds, as shown by ordinary\r\nseismographs, and the vibrations had attained a range of a few\r\nmillimetres before they affected the instrument in question. For the\r\nfirst 2-1/2 seconds, they occurred at the rate of four or five a\r\nsecond. The motion then suddenly became violent, and the ground was\r\ndisplaced 37 mm. in one direction, followed by a return movement of 73\r\nmm., and this again by one of 42 mm., the complete period of the\r\noscillation being 1.8 seconds. The succeeding vibrations were of\r\nsmaller amplitude and generally of shorter period for a minute and a\r\nhalf, then dying out during the last three minutes as almost\r\nimperceptible waves with a period of two or more seconds.[81]\r\n\r\nThough incomplete in some respects, this diagram illustrates clearly\r\nthe division of the earthquake-motion into three stages--namely, the\r\npreliminary tremors, the principal portion or most active part of an\r\nearthquake, and the end-portion or gradually evanescent slow\r\nundulations. In all three stages, however, both tremors and slow\r\nundulations may be present; and, as the latter, owing to their long\r\nperiod, are more or less insensible to human beings, the ripples of\r\nthe final stage give the impression of a tremulous termination as\r\ndescribed above. The duration of each stage varies considerably in\r\ndifferent earthquakes. Thus, in a valuable study of 27 earthquakes\r\nrecorded at Miyako, in Japan, during the years 1896-98, Messrs. Omori\r\nand Hirata show[82] that the duration of the preliminary stage varies\r\nfrom 0 to 26 seconds, with an average of about 10 seconds; that of the\r\nprincipal portion from 0.7 to 26 seconds, also with an average of\r\nabout 10 seconds; and that of the end portion from 28 and 105 seconds,\r\nwith an average of about one minute. The total apparent duration,\r\nhowever, depends on the instrument employed; one of the earthquakes,\r\nthat of April 23rd, 1898, disturbing the seismograph at Miyako for two\r\nminutes; while, at Tokio, a horizontal pendulum designed by Professor\r\nOmori oscillated for at least two hours. The periods of both ripples\r\nand slow undulations, again, vary from one earthquake to another; but\r\nit is worthy of notice that the average period of the undulations is\r\nalmost constant in all three stages of the motion, being 1.1, 1.3, and\r\n1.3 seconds, respectively, for the east-west component of the\r\nhorizontal motion, and 1.0 second throughout for the north-south\r\ncomponent. For the ripples, the average period is .08 second in the\r\npreliminary stage, .10 second in the principal portion, and .08 second\r\nagain in the end portion; those of the principal portion being\r\nslightly larger in amplitude, as well as longer in period, than the\r\nripples of the first and third stages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND-PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\nBesides the ripples already mentioned, there are others of still\r\nsmaller amplitude and shorter period that are sensible, but as a rule\r\nonly just sensible, to us as sounds. All the known evidence points to\r\nthe extraordinary lowness of the earthquake-sound. According to some\r\nobservers, it seems as if close to their lower limit of audibility;\r\nwhile others, however intently they may listen, are unable to hear the\r\nslightest noise. In other words, the most rapid vibrations present in\r\nan earthquake do not recur at a rate of much more than about 30 to 50\r\nper second; or, if they do, they are not strong enough to impress the\r\nhuman ear.\r\n\r\nTo most observers, the sound seems to increase and decrease in\r\nintensity with the shock, and so gradually and smoothly does this\r\nchange take place that the sound is frequently mistaken for that of an\r\nunderground train approaching the observer's house, passing beneath\r\nit, and receding in the opposite direction. Some persons, especially\r\nif situated within the meizoseismal area, hear also loud crashes in\r\nthe midst of the rumbling sound and simultaneously with the strongest\r\nvibrations. At a moderate distance, say from 30 to 40 miles, the sound\r\nbecomes more harsh and grating while the shock is felt; and, at a\r\ngreater distance, even this change disappears, and nothing is heard\r\nbut an almost monotonous sound like the low roll of distant thunder.\r\nThe explanation of this is that the sound-vibrations are of different\r\nperiods and varying amplitude, and the limiting vibrations tend to\r\nbecome inaudible with increasing distance, the lower on account of\r\ntheir long period, the higher owing to their small amplitude.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the sound-area depends, even more than that of the\r\ndisturbed area, on the personal equation of the observers. The lower\r\nlimit of audibility varies not only in different individuals, but also\r\nin different races. In Great Britain, it is doubtful whether an\r\nearthquake ever occurs unaccompanied by sound; and in the meizoseismal\r\narea the noise is heard by nearly all observers. With Italians, the\r\naverage lower limit of audibility is higher than with the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace; slight shocks frequently occur without noticeable sound, but\r\nwith strong ones, the larger number of observers is sure to include\r\none or more capable of hearing the rumbling noise. The Japanese are,\r\nhowever, seldom affected by the most rapid earthquake-vibrations, and\r\nthe strongest shocks may be unattended by any recorded sound. The\r\nresult is manifest in the size of the sound-area in different\r\ncountries. In the Hereford earthquake, the sound-area contained 70,000\r\nsquare miles; in the Neapolitan earthquake, about 3,300 square miles;\r\nwhile, in Japanese earthquakes, the sound is rarely heard more than a\r\nfew miles from the epicentre.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of this personal equation of the observers is that the\r\nsound-vibrations apparently outrace those of longer period. The\r\nItalians, for instance, generally hear the sound that precedes the\r\nshock, and more rarely the weaker sound that follows it. In Japan,\r\nonly the earlier sound-vibrations, if any, seem to be audible. In\r\nGreat Britain, on the contrary, the fore-sound is perceptible to four,\r\nand the after-sound to three, out of every five observers; and these\r\nproportions are maintained roughly to considerable distances from the\r\nepicentre. It follows, therefore, that the sound-vibrations and those\r\nwhich constitute the shock must travel with nearly, if not quite, the\r\nsame velocity; and that the greater duration of the sound is due\r\neither to the prolongation of the initial movement or to the\r\noverlapping of the principal focus by the sound-focus. Neither\r\nalternative can be regarded as improbable, but observations made on\r\nBritish earthquakes point to the latter explanation as the true one.\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficient to refer to two phenomena in support of this\r\nstatement. In the first place, the percentage of observers who hear\r\nthe fore-sound varies with the direction from the epicentre. Thus,\r\nduring the Inverness earthquake of 1901, the majority of observers in\r\nAberdeenshire regarded the sound as beginning and ending with the\r\nshock; while, in counties lying more nearly along the course of the\r\ngreat fault, the sound was generally heard both before and after the\r\nshock (p. 253). In this case, then, the initial and concluding sound\r\nvibrations must have come chiefly from the margins of the seismic\r\nfocus; and those from the margin nearest to an observer would be more\r\nsensible than those from the farther margin. Again, in slight\r\nearthquakes, such as the Cornwall earthquake of April 1, 1898,[83] the\r\ncurves of equal sound intensity, while their axes are parallel to\r\nthose of the isoseismal lines, are displaced laterally with respect to\r\nthese curves, owing to the arrival of the strongest sound-vibrations\r\nfrom the upper margin of an inclined seismic focus.\r\n\r\nWhen a fault-slip occurs, the displacement is obviously greatest in\r\nthe central region, and dies out gradually towards the margins of the\r\nfocus. The phenomena described above show that the evanescent\r\ndisplacement within these margins generate sound-vibrations only; and\r\nthat the greater slip within the central region produces also the more\r\nimportant vibrations that compose the shock. As the former are\r\nperceptible over a limited district, while the latter may be felt\r\nthrough half a continent, it is clear that the sound-area should bear\r\nno fixed relation in point of size to the disturbed area, but should\r\nbe comparatively greater for a slight shock than for a strong one.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF THE EARTH-WAVES.\r\n\r\nIf we consider only the earthquakes here described, we see at once how\r\ngreat is the diversity in the estimated velocity of the earth-waves.\r\nOn the one hand, we have a value as high as 5.2 kms. per sec. for the\r\nCharleston earthquake, and, at the other end of the scale, a value of\r\n0.9 km. per sec. for the Hereford earthquake. Between them, and\r\nequally trustworthy, lie the estimates of 3.0 km. per sec. for the\r\nIndian earthquake, and 2.1 kms. per sec. for the Japanese earthquake\r\nand its immediate successors.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to account entirely for such discordance. Errors of\r\nobservation may be responsible for a small part of the differences.\r\nThe initial strength of the disturbance appears to have some effect,\r\nand the nature of the rocks traversed must be a factor of consequence\r\nwhen the distances in question are not very great. In the Japanese and\r\nHereford earthquakes, all three may have combined to produce the\r\ndivergent results, the distance in these cases being only 275 and 142\r\nkms. respectively.\r\n\r\nIn the Indian and Charleston earthquakes, the distances are much\r\ngreater (1944 and 1487 kms.), and the variety of rocks traversed must\r\ntend to give a truer average. In the former, the result obtained (3.0\r\nkms. per sec.) agrees so closely with the velocity of the long-period\r\nundulations of distant earthquakes as to suggest that it was these\r\nwaves that were timed at the stations west of Calcutta and disturbed\r\nthe magnetographs at Bombay.[84]\r\n\r\nOmitting, then, the Indian estimate, we find that, for the Japanese\r\nand Charleston earthquakes, the velocity increases with the distance\r\nas measured along the surface. To a certain extent, such a result\r\nmight have been expected, had we assumed the earthquake-waves to\r\ntravel along the chords joining the focus to very distant places of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe wave-paths that penetrate the earth are straight lines, however,\r\nonly when the conditions that determine the velocity are uniform\r\nthroughout, and such uniformity we have no reason to expect. From what\r\nwe know of the earth's interior, there can, indeed, be little doubt\r\nthat the velocity of earthquake-waves increases with the depth below\r\nthe surface, and that the wave-paths in consequence are curved lines\r\nwith their convexity downwards. It would be out of place to state more\r\nthan the principal result of the recent investigations by Dr. A.\r\nSchmidt[85] and Prof. P. Rudzki[86] on this subject. These are based on\r\nthe assumptions that the velocity increases with the depth below the\r\nsurface, and that it is always the same at the same depth. From the\r\nfocus of the earthquake, wave-paths diverge in all directions. Those\r\nwhich start horizontally curve upwards, and intersect the surface of\r\nthe earth in a circle dividing the whole surface into two areas of very\r\nunequal size. Within the small area, the surface-velocity is infinite\r\nat the epicentre, and decreases outwards until it is least on the\r\nboundary-circle. In the larger region beyond, the surface-velocity\r\nincreases with the distance from the epicentre, until, at the antipodes\r\nof that point, it is again infinite. But, as the depth of the focus is\r\nalways slight compared with the radius of the earth, the small circular\r\narea surrounding the epicentre is practically negligible, and we may\r\nregard the surface-velocity of the waves that traverse the body of the\r\nearth as a quantity that continually increases with the distance from\r\nthe epicentre.\r\n\r\nHow fully this interesting theoretical result has been confirmed is\r\nwell shown in Mr. Oldham's recent and very valuable investigation on\r\nthe propagation of earthquake-motion to great distances.[87] A study\r\nof the records of the Indian earthquake revealed the existence of\r\nthree series of waves, the first two consisting in all probability of\r\nlongitudinal and transversal waves travelling through the body of the\r\nearth, and the third of undulations spreading over its surface (pp.\r\n282-285). Extending his inquiries to ten other earthquakes originating\r\nin six different centres, Mr. Oldham distinguishes the same three\r\nphases in their movements; the third phase being the most constantly\r\nrecorded, the second less so, while the first phase is the most\r\nfrequently absent. With the exception of a few very divergent records,\r\nthe initial times of these phases and the maximum epoch of the third\r\nphase are plotted on the accompanying diagram (Fig. 80), in which\r\ndistances from the epicentre in degrees of arc are represented along\r\nthe horizontal line and the time-interval in minutes along the\r\nperpendicular line. The dots near the two lower curves refer to the\r\nrecords of the heavily weighted Italian instruments, and the crosses\r\nto those of the light horizontal pendulums, which respond somewhat\r\nirregularly to the motion of the first two phases (p. 282). In the\r\nthird phase, there is less divergence between the indications of the\r\ntwo classes of instruments, and dots are used in each case for the\r\ninitial, and crosses for the maximum epoch.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 80.--Time-curves of principal epochs of\r\n   earthquake-waves of distant origin. (_Oldham._)]\r\n\r\nOf the smoothed curves drawn between these series of points, those\r\nmarked A, B, and C represent the time-curves of the beginnings of the\r\nfirst, second, and third phases respectively, while D is the\r\ntime-curve for the maximum of the third phase.\r\n\r\nThe concavity of the two lower lines towards the horizontal base-line\r\nshows that the surface-velocity of the corresponding waves increases\r\nrapidly with the distance, far more so than would be possible with\r\nrectilinear motion. The rates at which these waves travel through the\r\nearth therefore increase with the depth, and the wave-paths must in\r\nconsequence be curved lines convex towards the centre of the earth.\r\n\r\nIf the time-curves A and B were continued backwards to the origin,\r\ntheir inclinations at that point to the horizontal line give the\r\ninitial velocities of the corresponding waves, which prove to be about\r\n5 and 3 kms. per sec. respectively. Now, according to recent\r\nexperiments made by Mr. H. Nagaoka on the elastic constants of\r\nrocks,[88] the mean velocity of seven archaean rocks is 5.1 kms. per\r\nsec. for the longitudinal waves, and 2.8 kms. per sec. for the\r\ntransversal waves--values which agree so closely with those obtained\r\nfor the first two series of earthquake-waves as to leave little doubt\r\nwith regard to their character.\r\n\r\nThe other time-curves, C and D, corresponding to the initial and\r\nmaximum epochs of the third phase, are practically straight lines.\r\nSome of the records are slightly discordant for the average curve,\r\nespecially for the initial epoch; but it is often difficult to define\r\nthe commencement of this phase with precision. At any rate, the\r\nobservations show no distinct sign of an increase in the\r\nsurface-velocity of these waves with the distance from the origin. It\r\nmay therefore be concluded that they travel along the surface with\r\nvelocities which are practically constant for each individual\r\nearthquake, the largest waves at the rate of about 2.9 kms. per sec.,\r\nand the advance waves with a velocity of about 3.3 kms. per sec.,\r\nrising occasionally to over 4.0 kms. per sec.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE EPICENTRAL AREA.\r\n\r\nChanges of elevation have long been known as accompaniments of great\r\nearthquakes, though many of the earlier observations and measurements\r\nleft much to be desired in accuracy and completeness. The Japanese\r\nearthquake of 1891, however, placed the reality of such movements\r\nbeyond doubt, and revealed the existence of a fault-scarp, with a\r\nheight in one place of 18 or 20 feet, and a length of at least 40, if\r\nnot of 70, miles. In the Indian earthquake of 1897, the fault-scarps\r\nwere shorter, though more pronounced in character, the largest known\r\n(the Chedrang fault) being about 12 miles long, and having a maximum\r\nthrow at the surface of 35 feet. In some other recent earthquakes,\r\nalso, remarkable fault-scarps have been developed. After the great\r\nshocks felt in Eastern Greece on April 20th and 27th, 1894, a fissure\r\nwas traced for a distance of about 34 miles, running in an\r\neast-south-east and west-north-west direction through the epicentral\r\ndistrict, and varying in width from an inch or two to more than three\r\nyards. That it was a fault, and not an ordinary fissure, was evident\r\nfrom its great length, its uniform direction, and its independence of\r\ngeological structure. The throw was generally small, in no place\r\nexceeding five feet.[89] Again, in British Baluchistan, after the\r\nsevere earthquake of December 20th, 1892, a fresh crack was observed\r\nin the ground running for several miles in a straight line parallel to\r\nthe axis of the Khojak range. It coincided almost exactly with a line\r\nof springs, and was clearly produced by a fresh slip along an old line\r\nof fault, for before the earthquake it had the appearance of an old\r\nroad, and the natives assert that the ground has always cracked along\r\nthis line with every severe shock. In 1892, the change in relative\r\nheight of the two sides of the fault was small, in one place where it\r\nwas measured being only two inches.[90]\r\n\r\nBut other changes, besides those in a vertical direction, occasionally\r\ntake place; though, owing to their recent discovery, comparatively few\r\nexamples are as yet known. While the throw of the Japanese fault\r\nvaried greatly in amount, and once even in direction, there was also a\r\nconstant shift towards the northwest of the ground on the north-east\r\nside of the fault, the displacement at one spot being as much as 13\r\nfeet. In the fault-scarp formed in 1894 in Eastern Greece, a similar\r\nshift took place, though to what extent is unknown. There is,\r\nmoreover, evidence of actual compression of the earth's crust at right\r\nangles to the fault-line. The Neo valley, traversed by the Japanese\r\nfault, was apparently narrower after the earthquake than it was\r\nbefore, and plots of ground were reduced from 48 to 30 feet in\r\nlength--_i.e._, by nearly 40 per cent. In British Baluchistan, the\r\nformation of the fissure referred to above was accompanied both by\r\ncompression perpendicular, and by shifting parallel, to the fault. The\r\nactual displacement in each direction is unknown, but the resultant\r\nwas not less than 27 inches.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that a fault-scarp is formed in the first place\r\nwith great rapidity. So abrupt, indeed, were the structural\r\ndisplacements in the epicentral area of the Indian earthquake, that\r\nthey contributed very materially to the intensity of the shock, giving\r\nrise to the excessive velocities observed at Rambrai and elsewhere (p.\r\n273). The growth of the scarp does not, however, always cease with the\r\nfirst great earthquake, though it may take place in a contrary sense,\r\nas in the elevation connected with the Conception earthquake of 1835.\r\nThe principal shock, according to Darwin, was followed during the few\r\nsucceeding days \"by some hundred minor ones (though of no\r\ninconsiderable violence), which seemed to come from the same quarter\r\nfrom which the first had proceeded; whilst, on the other hand, the\r\nlevel of the ground was certainly not raised by them; but, on the\r\ncontrary, after an interval of some weeks, it stood rather lower than\r\nit did immediately after the great convulsion.\"[91]\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER-SHOCKS.\r\n\r\nA series of after-shocks, more or less long, is a constant attendant\r\non every great tectonic earthquake, and few are the earthquakes of\r\nany degree of strength that can be regarded as completely isolated.\r\nEven in those which visit this country, after-shocks are seldom\r\nabsent. For instance, confining ourselves to the last few years, the\r\nPembroke earthquake of 1892 was followed by 8 shocks, the Inverness\r\nearthquake of 1890 by at least 10, and possibly by 19 shocks, and that\r\nof the same district in 1901 by 15 well-defined after-shocks in\r\naddition to many others recorded by one observer. Of 300 Italian\r\nearthquakes strong enough to cause some damage to buildings, Dr.\r\nCancani finds that every one was either preceded or followed, and\r\nchiefly followed, by its own train of minor shocks.\r\n\r\nFor some hours, and even for days, after a great earthquake, the\r\nshocks are so numerous that it is often impossible to keep count of\r\nthem. Many local centres spring into activity in different parts of\r\nthe epicentral area; and, though only the strongest shocks can be\r\nidentified elsewhere, it is clear that as a rule the shocks felt at\r\nany one station are quite distinct from those observed at another.\r\n\r\nThe enormous number of after-shocks that follow some earthquakes can\r\nonly be realised when they are subjected to continuous seismographic\r\nregistration; and, even then, countless earth-sounds and the slightest\r\ntremors must escape detection. The shocks may, indeed, succeed one\r\nanother so rapidly that one begins before another ends, and the result\r\nis an almost incessant tremulous motion rendered manifest by the\r\nquivering of water-surfaces or the swinging of chandeliers. Of the\r\ntotal number of after-shocks, we may form some idea from recent\r\nrecords in Japan. After the Mino-Owari earthquake of 1891, 3,365\r\nshocks were recorded within little more than two years at Gifu, and\r\n1,298 at Nagoya, but neither of these figures includes the shocks felt\r\nwithin the first few hours. Of the Kumamoto earthquake of July 28th,\r\n1889, the after-shocks recorded at Kumamoto until the end of 1893\r\namount to 922; and those of the Kagoshima earthquake of September 7th,\r\n1893, recorded at Chiran until the end of January 1894, to 480. During\r\nthe first 30 days, the numbers recorded were 1,746 at Gifu, 340 at\r\nKumamoto, and 278 at Chiran; showing, as Professor Omori remarks, that\r\nthe after-shocks diminish in frequency with the size of the disturbed\r\nareas,[92]--_i.e._, roughly with the initial intensity of the shocks.\r\n\r\nNext to absolute number, the rapid decline in general frequency is the\r\nmost marked characteristic of after-shocks. Professor Omori has shown\r\nthat, excluding minor oscillations, it follows the law represented\r\ngeographically by the curves in Fig. 51, and algebraically by the\r\nequation y = k / (h + x), where _y_ is the frequency at time _x_ and\r\n_h_ and _k_ are constants for one and the same earthquake. By means of\r\nthis formula, it is possible to estimate roughly the interval of time\r\nthat must elapse before the seismic activity of the central district\r\nresumes its normal value. For the Mino-Owari earthquake, this proves\r\nto be about forty years, for the Kumamoto earthquake about seven or\r\neight years, and for the Kagoshima earthquake about three or four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn a recent memoir on Italian after-shocks,[93] Dr. Cancani has urged\r\nthat other factors besides initial intensity determine the duration of\r\na seismic period, and prominently among these he places the depth of\r\nthe seismic focus. When the depth is very small, the duration of the\r\nperiod is short, not much more than ten days; when the depth is\r\nmoderate, the duration may extend to three months; and, when great, it\r\nmay amount to several years.\r\n\r\nThe principal law that governs the distribution of after-shocks in\r\ntime may be regarded as well-established. It is otherwise with regard\r\nto their distribution in space. This has been examined only in the\r\ncases of the Japanese earthquake of 1891 and the Inverness earthquake\r\nof 1901. So far as we can judge from the evidence which they furnish,\r\nafter-shocks appear to be most numerous within and near the central\r\nportion of the seismic focus; though the area of maximum activity is\r\nsubject to continual oscillation. In this region, also, there is\r\nevidence of a gradual decrease in the depths of the after-shock foci;\r\nwhile, near the extremities of the epicentral area, there occur\r\ndistricts of slightly greater frequency than elsewhere. With the lapse\r\nof time, there seems therefore to be a constant extension, both\r\nupwards and longitudinally, of the area over which the principal\r\nfault-slip took place.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nIn the introductory chapter, a brief sketch is given of the different\r\ncauses to which earthquakes are assigned. With those due to rock-falls\r\nin subterranean channels, we need have little to do. The shocks are\r\ninvariably slight, and the part they play in the shaping of the\r\nearth's crust is insignificant. Volcanic earthquakes possess a higher\r\ndegree of interest. They represent, no doubt, incipient or\r\nunsuccessful attempts to produce an eruption. They may be the\r\nforerunners of a great catastrophe.\r\n\r\nOf far higher importance in the history of our globe is the third\r\nclass of earthquakes, including all those connected with the manifold\r\nchanges which the crust has undergone. In the slow annealing process,\r\nto which it has been subjected from the earliest times, the crust has\r\nbeen crumpled and fractured, elevated into the loftiest mountain\r\nranges or depressed below the level of the sea. Every sudden yielding\r\nunder stress is the cause of an earthquake. It is chiefly, perhaps\r\nalmost entirely, in the formation of faults that this yielding is\r\nmanifested. The initial fracturing may be the cause of one or many\r\nshocks, but infinitely the larger number must be referred to the slow\r\ngrowth of the fault, the intermittent slips, now in one part, now in\r\nanother, which, after the lapse of ages, culminate in a great\r\ndisplacement. Of the length of time occupied in the formation of a\r\nsingle fault, we can make no estimate in years. The anticlinal fault\r\nof Charnwood Forest dates from a pre-carboniferous period. In 1893 it\r\nhad not ceased to grow.[94]\r\n\r\nStill less can we conceive, however faintly, the number of elemental\r\nslips that constitute the history of a single fault. We may think, if\r\nwe please, of the 143 tremors and earth-sounds noted at Comrie in\r\nPerthshire during the last three months of 1839, of the 306\r\nearthquakes felt in the Island of Zante during the year 1896, or the\r\n1,746 shocks recorded at Gifu during thirty days in 1891; but we shall\r\nbe as far as ever from realising the vast number of steps involved in\r\nthe growth of a fault, let alone a mountain-chain.\r\n\r\nYet, all over the land-surface of the globe, the crust is intersected\r\nby numberless faults, and hardly any portion is there in which some or\r\nmany of these faults are not growing. One country, indeed, such as\r\nGreat Britain, may have reached a condition of comparative stagnancy;\r\nthe fault-slips are few and slight, and earthquakes in consequence are\r\nrare and generally inconspicuous. In another, like Eastern Japan and\r\nthe adjoining ocean-bed, the movements are frequent, occasionally\r\nalmost incessant, and few years pass without some great convulsion by\r\nwhich cities are wrecked and hundreds of human lives are lost. At such\r\ntimes, we magnify the rôle of earthquakes, and are in some danger of\r\nforgetting that, in the formation of a mountain-chain or continent,\r\nthey serve no higher purpose than the creaking of a wheel in the\r\ncomplex movements of a great machine.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[79] _Phil.
