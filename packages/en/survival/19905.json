M. Soule of\r\nthe experiment station of Tennessee, Professor H. H. Hume of the\r\nexperiment station of Louisiana and Mr. W. T. Shaw of the experiment\r\nstation of Oregon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR'S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome books have been written on Clover in the United States, and as far\r\nas they go they serve a good purpose. Many references and discussions\r\nhave also appeared in various bulletins and reports issued by the\r\nexperiment stations. These have proved helpful not only in the States in\r\nwhich they have been issued, but also in other States where the\r\nconditions are similar. But no book or bulletin has yet appeared which\r\ndiscusses the growth of clovers as applicable to all parts of the United\r\nStates and Canada. Nor has any been issued which takes up the subject in\r\norderly and consecutive sequence. It is evident, therefore, that there\r\nis not only room for a book which will cover the ground with at least\r\nmeasureable fulness, but also in concise and orderly succession, but\r\nthere is great need for it. It has been the aim of the author to write\r\nsuch a book.\r\n\r\nOnly those varieties of clover are discussed at length which are\r\npossessed of economic value. The treatment of the subjects is virtually\r\nthe same as was adopted in writing the book on \"Grasses and How to Grow\r\nThem.\" Some references are made to the history, characteristics and\r\ndistribution of each variety. These are followed by discussions with\r\nreference to soil adaptation; place in the rotation; preparing the\r\nsoil; sowing; pasturing; harvesting for hay; securing seed; and renewing\r\nthe stand.\r\n\r\nThe book is intended, in some measure at least, to meet the needs of the\r\nstudents of agriculture, with reference to the plants discussed and also\r\nof all who are concerned in the tilling of the soil.\r\n\r\n_St. Anthony Park, Minn._\r\n_1906_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.

Varieties that are of but little value to the farmer will be\r\ndiscussed briefly, if discussed at all. The discussions will be\r\nconducted from the standpoint of the practical agriculturist rather than\r\nfrom that of the botanist. It is proposed to point out the varieties of\r\nclover worthy of cultivation, where and how they ought to be cultivated,\r\nand for what uses.\r\n\r\n=Definition of Clover.=--According to Johnson's Encyclopaedia, clover or\r\ntrefoil is a plant of the genus _Trifolium_ and the family _Leguminosae_.\r\nThe Standard Dictionary defines it as any one of several species of\r\nplants of the genus _Trifolium_ of the bean family _Leguminosae_. Viewed\r\nfrom the standpoint of the American farmer it may be defined in the\r\ncollective sense as a family of plants leguminous in character, which\r\nare unexcelled in furnishing forage and fodder to domestic animals, and\r\nunequaled in the renovating influences which they exert upon land. The\r\nterm _Trefoil_ is given because the leaves are divided into three\r\nleaflets. It is also applied to plants not included in the genus, but\r\nbelonging to the same order.\r\n\r\nThe true clovers have their flowers collected into roundish or oblong\r\nheads and in some instances into cone-shaped spikes. The flowers are\r\nsmall and of several colors in the different varieties, as crimson,\r\nscarlet, pink, blue, yellow and white, according to the variety, and\r\nsome are variously tinted. The stems are herbaceous and not twining. The\r\nseeds are inclosed in pods or seed sacks, each of which contains one,\r\ntwo and sometimes, but not often, three or four seeds. The plants have\r\ntap roots, and in some varieties these go far down into the subsoil. The\r\nroots are also in some varieties considerably branched.\r\n\r\n=Varieties.=--At least twenty varieties, native or naturalized, are\r\nfound in Great Britain; more than twelve varieties belong to the United\r\nStates. The more valuable varieties found in this country have been\r\nintroduced from Europe, unless it be the small white clover (_Trifolium\r\nrepens_). Viewed from the standpoint of the agriculturist the varieties\r\nthat are most generally useful include medium red clover (_Trifolium\r\npratense_), alfalfa (_Medicago sativa_), alsike (_Trifolium hybridum_),\r\nmammoth (_Trifolium magnum_), crimson (_Trifolium incarnatum_) and small\r\nwhite (_Trifolium repens_). The varieties which flourish only in the\r\nSouth include the Japan (_Lespedeza striata_) and the burr clover\r\n(_Medicago denticulata_). Sweet clover (_Melilotus alba_), sometimes\r\ncalled Bokhara, which will grow equally well North and South, is worthy\r\nof attention because of its power to grow under hard conditions, in\r\norder to provide honey for bees and to renovate soils. Other varieties\r\nmay render some service to agriculture, but their value will not compare\r\nwith that of the varieties named.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable of the varieties named in providing pasture, include\r\nthe medium red, the mammoth, the alsike and the small white. The most\r\nvaluable in providing hay are the medium red, alfalfa and alsike. The\r\nmost valuable, viewed from the standpoint only of soil renovation, are\r\nthe medium red, mammoth, alsike, crimson, Japan and sweet. The most\r\nvaluable in producing honey accessible to tame bees, are the small\r\nwhite, alsike and sweet.\r\n\r\n=Distinguishing Characteristics.=--Clovers differ from one another in\r\nduration, habit of growth, persistence in growth, their power to endure\r\nlow or warm temperatures, and ability to maintain a hold upon the soil.\r\nOf the varieties named, alfalfa, the small white and alsike varieties\r\nare perennial. That most intensely so is the first variety named. The\r\nmedium red and mammoth varieties are biennial, but sometimes they assume\r\nthe perennial quality. Sweet clover is biennial. The crimson, Japan and\r\nburr varieties are annual.\r\n\r\nSome varieties, as alfalfa, crimson and sweet clover, are upright in\r\ntheir habit of growth. Others, as the small white and the burr, are\r\nrecumbent. Others again, as the medium red, alsike and mammoth, are\r\nspreading and upright. The alfalfa and medium red varieties grow most\r\npersistently through the whole season. The sweet, small white and alsike\r\nvarieties can best endure cold, and the sweet, Japan and burr varieties\r\ncan best endure heat. The small white, Japan, burr and sweet clovers\r\nstand highest in ability to maintain a hold upon the soil.\r\n\r\nThe minor points of difference are such as relate to the shape and color\r\nof the leaves, the tints of shade that characterize the leaflets, the\r\nshape and size of the heads and the distinguishing shades of color in\r\nthe blossoms.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics which they possess in common are the high protein\r\ncontent found in them, the marked palatability of the pasture and hay,\r\nunless in the sweet and burr varieties, the power which they have to\r\nenrich and otherwise improve soils, and the honey which they furnish.\r\n\r\n=Plan of Discussion.=--Chapter I., that is, the present chapter, as\r\nalready indicated, is introductory, and outlines the nature, scope and\r\nplan of the work. Chapter II. deals with the general principles and\r\nfacts which relate to the growing of clovers. A close study of these\r\nwill, in the judgment of the author, prove helpful to those who engage\r\nin growing any of the varieties of clover discussed in the book.\r\nChapters III. to XI. inclusive treat of individual varieties, a chapter\r\nbeing devoted to each variety. It has been the aim of the author to\r\ndiscuss them in the order of the relative importance which they bear to\r\nthe whole country and to devote space to them accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe following varieties are discussed and in the order named: Medium Red\r\nclover, Alfalfa, Alsike, Mammoth, Crimson, Small White, Japan, Burr and\r\nSweet. All of these varieties will be found worthy of more or less\r\nattention on the part of the husbandmen in the various parts of this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nChapter XII. is devoted to a brief discussion of miscellaneous varieties\r\nwhich have as yet been but little grown in this country, or of varieties\r\nof but local interest. The former are Sainfoin (_Onobrychis sativa_),\r\nEgyptian clover (_Trifolium Alexandrianum_), yellow clover (_Medicago\r\nlupulina_), Sand Lucerne (_Medicago media_), and a newly introduced\r\nvariety of Japanese clover (_Lespedeza bicolor_). These may prove more\r\nor less valuable to the agriculture of the United States when they have\r\nbeen duly tested, a work which as yet has been done only in the most\r\nlimited way. The latter include Florida clover (_Desmodium tortuosum_),\r\nmore frequently called Beggar Weed, Buffalo clover (_Trifolium\r\nreflexum_), and Seaside clover (_Trifolium invulneratum_). These may be\r\nworthy of some attention in limited areas where the conditions are\r\nfavorable, but it is not likely that they will ever be very generally\r\ngrown. They are dwelt upon rather to show their small economic\r\nimportance and with a view to prevent needless experimentation with\r\nplants possessed of so little real merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHICH APPLY TO THE GROWING OF CLOVERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn growing clovers, as in growing other crops of the same species, which\r\nembrace several varieties, certain features of management will apply\r\nmore or less to all of these in common. It will be the aim to point out\r\nthe chief of these in the present chapter.\r\n\r\n=Adaptation in Clovers.=--Adaptation in the varieties of clover\r\nconsidered will be more fully given when discussing these individually,\r\nbut enough will be said here to facilitate comparisons. Clover in one or\r\nthe other of its varieties can be grown in almost all parts of the\r\nUnited States and Canada. Speaking in a general way, the medium and\r\nmammoth varieties can be grown at their best between parallels 37 deg. and\r\n49 deg. north latitude. Alfalfa has special adaptation for mountain valleys\r\nof the entire West, but it will also grow in good form in parts of all,\r\nor nearly all, the other States. Alsike clover grows in about the same\r\nareas as the common and mammoth varieties, but it may also be grown\r\nfurther North, owing to its greater hardihood. Crimson clover has\r\nhighest adaptation to the States east of the Allegheny Mountains and\r\nwest of the Cascades, but will also grow in the more Central States\r\nsouth, in which moisture is abundant. Small white clover will grow in\r\nany part of the United States or Canada in which moisture is\r\nsufficiently present. Japan and burr clover grow best south of parallel\r\n37 deg. and east of longitude 98 deg.. Sweet clover will grow in all the States\r\nand provinces of the United States and Canada, but has highest\r\nadaptation for the Central and Southern States.\r\n\r\nWith reference to adaptation to soils, medium and mammoth clover grow\r\nbest on upland clay loam soils, such as have sustained a growth of\r\nhardwood timber, and on the volcanic ash soils of the Western mountain\r\nvalley. Alfalfa flourishes best on those mountain valley soils when\r\nirrigated, or when these are so underlaid with water as to furnish the\r\nplants with moisture. Alsike clover has much the same adaptation to\r\nsoils as the medium and mammoth varieties, but will grow better than\r\nthese on low-lying soils well stored with humus. Crimson clover has\r\nhighest adaptation for sandy loam soils into which the roots can\r\npenetrate easily. Small, white clover has adaptation for soils very\r\nsimilar to that of alsike clover. Japan clover and burr clover will grow\r\non almost any kind of soil, but on good soils the growth will, of\r\ncourse, be much more vigorous than on poor soils. Sweet clover seems to\r\ngrow about equally well on sandy loams and clay loams, but it has also\r\nmuch power to grow in stiff clays and even in infertile sands.\r\n\r\n=Place in the Rotation.=--All the varieties of clover discussed in this\r\nvolume may be grown in certain rotations. Their adaptation for this use,\r\nhowever, differs much. This increases as the natural period of the life\r\nof the plant lessens and _vice versa_. Consequently, the medium red\r\nvariety, the mammoth, the crimson, the Japan and the burr varieties\r\nstand high in such adaptation. The alsike, living longer, is lower in\r\nits adaptation, and alfalfa, because of its long life, stands lowest in\r\nthis respect. The small, white variety is almost invariably grown or\r\nfound growing spontaneously along with grasses, hence no definite place\r\nhas been or can be assigned to it in the rotation. Sweet clover being\r\nregarded by many as a weed has not had any place assigned to it in a\r\nregular rotation, although in certain localities it may yet be grown for\r\npurposes of soil renovation. (See page 306.)\r\n\r\nAll these crops are leguminous without any exception. This fact is of\r\ngreat significance where crops can be rotated. They have power to gather\r\nnitrogen from the air and store it in the soil in tubercles which form\r\non their roots, in all soils in which they produce a vigorous growth.\r\nThis fact indicates where they should come in the rotation. They should\r\nbe grown with a view to gather food for other crops made to follow them,\r\nwhich have not the same power. They should, therefore, be made to\r\nprecede such crops as the small cereals, corn, the sorghums, the millets\r\nand cotton. But since these clover plants have the power to bring\r\nnitrogen from the air, it must not be supposed that they will grow with\r\nsufficient vigor in soils destitute of this element. They must be able\r\nto appropriate enough from the seed soil to give them a good start\r\nbefore they can draw nitrogen from the air, hence, though they may be\r\nmade to follow almost any kind of crop, it may sometimes be necessary to\r\napply some nitrogenous fertilizer before they will make a vigorous\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe clovers, unless in the case of some of the smaller varieties, are\r\nmore commonly sown to provide hay than pasture in the first crops\r\nobtained from them. The value of the hay is increased or lessened in\r\nproportion as weeds are present. To insure cleanliness in the hay crop,\r\ntherefore, the system which aims to sow clover seed on land to which\r\nclean cultivation has been given while growing on them a cultivated\r\ncrop, as corn or field roots, meets with much favor. The mechanical\r\ncondition of the soil immediately after growing these crops also favors\r\nthe vigorous growth of the young clover plants, more especially when\r\nthey are sown upon the surface of the land after some form of surface\r\ncultivation, rather than upon a surface made by plowing the land after\r\ncultivation has been given to it, but to this there may be some\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nClover in some of its varieties is frequently grown from year to year in\r\norchards and for the two-fold purpose of gathering food for the trees\r\nand providing for them a cover crop in winter. The medium red and\r\ncrimson varieties are preferred for such a use. The latter is the more\r\nsuitable of the two, since it does not draw on soil moisture needed by\r\nthe trees, owing to the season at which it is grown. Enough of the seed\r\nof these crops may be allowed to mature to re-seed the land from year to\r\nyear, and thus keep it producing. The clover plants not only gather\r\nnitrogen for the fruit trees, but in their decay they increase the power\r\nof the soil to retain moisture for the benefit of the trees.\r\n\r\nSome varieties of clover may be grown as catch crops, that is, as crops\r\nwhich are grown in addition to some other crop produced the same season.\r\nWhen thus grown, it is usually for purposes of soil improvement rather\r\nthan to furnish food. The varieties best adapted for this purpose in the\r\nNorthern States and Canada are the medium red and the crimson, the\r\nlatter being much more circumscribed in the area where it will grow\r\nsuccessfully than the former. When medium red clover is thus grown, it\r\nis commonly sown along with one of the small cereal grains, and is\r\nburied in the autumn or in the following spring. (See page 75.) The\r\nextent of the advantage is dependent chiefly on the amount of the growth\r\nmade, and this in turn is influenced by the character of the soil, the\r\nseason, and the nurse crop. In certain areas favorable to the growth of\r\nclover some good farmers sow clover along with all the small cereal\r\ngrains which they grow. Crimson clover is usually sown in the late\r\nsummer after some crop has been reaped and it is plowed under the\r\nfollowing spring. (See page 250.)\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States Japan clover and burr clover will serve the\r\npurpose of catch crops better than the other varieties. The former will\r\nfollow a winter crop (see page 284), and the latter a summer crop. (See\r\npage 294.)\r\n\r\nAlthough alfalfa is not usually looked upon as a rotation crop in the\r\nRocky Mountain valleys, it may be made such a crop. In these it grows\r\nso vigorously as to fill the soil with its roots in one or two seasons,\r\nhence it may be made to rotate profitably with other crops. (See page\r\n135.) In such instances, however, medium red clover would probably\r\nanswer the purpose quite as well, and possibly better, since the labor\r\nof burying it with the plow would be less difficult.\r\n\r\nWhile some varieties of clover may be grown in various rotations and\r\nwith profit, one of the best of these, where the conditions are\r\nfavorable, is a three years' rotation. The first year some small cereal\r\ngrain is grown and clover is sown along with it or, at least, on the\r\nsame land. The next year the clover is grown for hay or pasture. The\r\nthird year a crop of corn, potatoes or vegetables is grown, and the\r\nfollowing year small cereal grain and clover. The clover may thus be\r\nmade to furnish nitrogen indefinitely for the other crops, but in some\r\ninstances it may be necessary to add phosphoric acid and potash.\r\n\r\n=Preparing the Soil.=--Clovers are usually sown with a nurse crop. The\r\nexceptions are crimson clover, and in many instances alfalfa. When thus\r\ngrown, the preparation of soil for the nurse crop will usually suffice\r\nfor the clovers also. But there may be instances in which it would be\r\nproper to give more attention to cleaning and pulverizing the soil to\r\nproperly fit it for receiving the clover seed. The leading essentials in\r\na seed-bed for clover are fineness, cleanness, moistness and firmness.\r\nOrdinarily black loam soils, sandy loam soils, sandy soils, humus soils\r\nand the volcanic ash soils of the West are made sufficiently fine\r\nwithout great labor. Clay soils may call for the free use of the harrow\r\nand roller used in some sort of alternation before they are sufficiently\r\npulverized. Excessive fineness in pulverization of these soils is also\r\nto be guarded against in rainy climates, lest they run together, but\r\nthis condition is present far less frequently than the opposite.\r\n\r\nCleanness can usually be secured when clovers follow cultivated crops by\r\nthe labor given to these when the land is not plowed in preparing it for\r\nthe clovers. In other instances the longer the land is plowed before\r\nputting in the seed and the more frequently the surface is stirred\r\nduring the growing part of the season, the cleaner will the seed-bed be.\r\n\r\nIn the spring the land is usually sufficiently moist for receiving the\r\nseed. In the autumn moisture is frequently deficient. Stirring the\r\nsurface of the soil occasionally with the harrow will materially\r\nincrease the moisture content in the soil near the surface, even in the\r\nabsence of rain. As crimson clover is usually sown in the late summer\r\nand alfalfa is frequently sown in the autumn, it may sometimes be\r\nnecessary to give much attention to securing sufficient moisture to\r\ninsure germination in the seed.\r\n\r\nWhen clovers are sown in the spring on land which is also growing a\r\nwinter crop, no preparation is necessary in preparing the land for\r\nreceiving the seed. On some soils the ground becomes sufficiently\r\nhoneycombed through the agency of water and frost to put it in a fine\r\ncondition for receiving the seed. When this condition is not present,\r\nthe seed will usually grow if sown amid the grain and covered with the\r\nharrow.\r\n\r\nWhen clovers are sown on sod land for the purpose of renewing pastures,\r\ndisking them will prepare them for receiving the seed. The extent of the\r\ndisking will depend on such conditions as the toughness of the sod and\r\nthe nature of the soil. Usually disking once when the frost is out a\r\nlittle way from the surface, and then disking across at an angle will\r\nsuffice, and in some instances disking one way only will be sufficient.\r\nOn newly cleared lands the clovers will usually grow without any\r\nstirring of the land before sowing, or any harrowing after sowing.\r\nClovers that are grown chiefly for pasture, as the small white, the\r\nJapan and the burr, will usually obtain a hold upon the soil if\r\nscattered upon the surface which is not soon to be cultivated.\r\n\r\n=Fertilizers.=--On certain soils low in fertility and much deficient in\r\nhumus, it may be necessary to apply fertilizers in some form before\r\nclovers will grow vigorously. Such are sandy soils that have been much\r\nworn by cropping, and also stiff clays in which the humus has become\r\npractically exhausted. In such instances green crops that can be grown\r\non such lands, as rye, for instance, plowed under when the ear begins to\r\nshoot, will be found helpful. If this can be followed on the sandy soil\r\nwith some crop to be fed off upon the land, as corn, for instance, and\r\nthe clover is sown, successful growth is likely to follow. On clays in\r\nthe condition named it may not be necessary to grow a second crop before\r\nsowing clover, since in these soils the lack is more one of humus than\r\nof plant food. The application of farmyard manure will answer the same\r\npurpose, if it can be spared for such a use.\r\n\r\nOther soils are so acid that clovers will not grow on them until the\r\nacidity is corrected, notwithstanding that plant food may be present in\r\nsufficient quantities. Such are soils, in some instances at least, that\r\nhave been newly drained, also soils that grow such plants as sorrels.\r\nThis condition will be improved if not entirely corrected by the\r\napplication of lime. On such soils this is most cheaply applied in the\r\nair-slaked form, such as is used in plastering and in quantities to\r\neffect the end sought. These will vary, and can only be ascertained\r\npositively by experiment.\r\n\r\nUsually it is not necessary to apply much farmyard manure in order to\r\ninduce growth in nearly all varieties of clover, and after free growth\r\nis obtained, it is not usually necessary to supply any subsequently for\r\nthe specific purpose named. In some soils, however, alfalfa is an\r\nexception. It may be necessary to enrich these with a liberal dressing\r\nof farmyard manure to insure a sufficiently strong growth in the plants\r\nwhen they are young. Having passed the first winter, further dressings\r\nare not absolutely essential, though they may prove helpful.\r\n\r\nFarmyard manure applied on the surface will always stimulate the growth\r\nof clovers, but it is not common to apply manure thus, as the need for\r\nit is greater in growing the other crops of the farm. When thus applied,\r\nit should be in a form somewhat reduced, otherwise the coarse parts may\r\nrake up in the hay. It is better applied in the autumn or early winter\r\nthan in the spring, as then more of the plant food in it has reached the\r\nroots of the clover plants, and they have also received benefit from the\r\nprotection which it has furnished them in winter.\r\n\r\nIn a great majority of instances, soils are sufficiently well supplied\r\nwith the more essential elements of fertility to grow reasonably good\r\ncrops of clover, hence it has not usually been found necessary to apply\r\ncommercial fertilizers to stimulate growth, as in the growing of\r\ngrasses. In some instances, however, these are not sufficiently\r\navailable, especially is this true of potash. Gypsum or land plaster has\r\nbeen often used to correct this condition, and frequently with excellent\r\nresults. It also aids in fixing volatile and escaping carbonates of\r\nammonia, and conveys them to the roots of the clover plants. It is\r\napplied in the ground form by sowing it over the land, and more commonly\r\njust when the clover is beginning to grow. The application of 50 to 200\r\npounds per acre has in many instances greatly increased the growth,\r\nwhether as pasture, hay or seed. The following indications almost\r\ncertainly point to the need of dressings of land plaster: 1. When the\r\nplants assume a bluish-green tint, rather than a pea-green, while they\r\nare growing. 2. When the plants fail to yield as they once did. 3. When\r\nyoung plants die after they have begun to grow in the presence of\r\nsufficient moisture. 4. When good crops can only be grown at long\r\nintervals, as, say, 5 to 8 years. It has also been noticed that on some\r\nsoils where gypsum has long been used in growing clover the response to\r\napplications of the plaster is a waning one, due doubtless to the too\r\nrapid depletion of the potash in the soil.\r\n\r\nPotassic fertilizers give the best results when applied to clovers, but\r\ndressings of phosphoric acid may also be helpful. Applications of\r\nmuriate or sulphate of potash or kainit may prove profitable, but on\r\nmany soils they are not necessary in growing clover. Wood ashes are also\r\nexcellent. They furnish potash finely divided and soluble, especially\r\nwhen applied in the unleached form. When applied unleached at the rate\r\nof 50 bushels per acre and leached at the rate of 200 bushels, the\r\nresults are usually very marked in stimulating growth in clover.\r\n\r\n=Seasons for Sowing.=--Clovers are more commonly sown in the springtime\r\nin the Northern States and Canada than at any other season and they are\r\nusually sown early in the spring, rather than late. On land producing a\r\nwinter crop, as rye or wheat, they can be sown in a majority of\r\ninstances as soon as the snow has melted. That condition of soil known\r\nas honeycombed furnishes a peculiarly opportune time for sowing these\r\nseeds, as it provides a covering for them while the land is moist, and\r\nthus puts them in a position to germinate as soon as growth begins. Such\r\na condition, caused by alternate freezing and thawing, does not occur on\r\nsandy soils. Where it does not so occur, sowing ought to be deferred\r\nuntil the surface of the ground has become dry enough to admit of\r\ncovering with a harrow. As in sowing the seeds of certain grasses good\r\nresults usually follow sowing just after a light fall of snow, which, as\r\nit melts, carries the seed down into the little openings in the soil.\r\nBut there are areas, especially in the American and Canadian northwest,\r\nwhere in some seasons the young clover plants would be injured from\r\nsowing the seed quite early. This, however, does not occur very\r\nfrequently. When sown on spring crops, as spring wheat, barley and oats,\r\nthe seed cannot, of course, be sown until these crops are sown. The\r\nearlier that these crops are sown the more likely are the clovers sown\r\nto make a stand, as they have more time to become rooted before the dry\r\nweather of summer begins. In a moist season the seed could be safely\r\nsown any time from spring until mid-summer, but since the weather cannot\r\nbe forecast, it is considered more or less hazardous to sow clovers in\r\nthese northern areas at any other season than that of early spring. If\r\nsown later, the seed will more certainly make a stand without a nurse\r\ncrop, since it will get more moisture. If sown later than August, the\r\nyoung plants are much more liable to perish in the winter.\r\n\r\nIn the States which lie between parallels 40 deg. and 35 deg. north, and between\r\nthe Atlantic and the 100th meridian west, clover seeds may be sown in\r\none form or another from early spring until the early autumn without\r\nincurring much hazard from winter killing in the young plants, but here\r\nalso early spring sowing will prove the most satisfactory. The hazard\r\nfrom sowing in the summer comes chiefly from want of sufficient moisture\r\nto germinate the seed.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States the seed is sown in the early spring or in the\r\nautumn. If sown late, the heat of summer is much against the plants.\r\nSeeds sown in the early autumn as soon as the rains come will make a\r\ngood stand before the winter, but there are some soils in the South in\r\nwhich alternate freezing and thawing in winter, much more frequent than\r\nin the North, would injure and in some instances destroy the plants.\r\n\r\nIn the Western valleys where irrigation is practiced, clover seeds may\r\nbe sown at any time that may be desired, from the early spring until the\r\nearly autumn. The ability to apply water when it is needed insures\r\nproper germination in the seed and vigor in the young plants.\r\n\r\n=Methods of Sowing.=--Clover seed may be sown by hand, by hand machines,\r\nand by the grain drill, with or without a grass-seed sowing attachment.\r\nThese respective methods of sowing will be discussed briefly here, but\r\nsince they are practically the same as the methods to be followed in\r\nsowing grass seeds, and since they are discussed more fully in the book\r\n\"Grasses and How to Grow Them\" by the author, readers who wish to pursue\r\nthe subject further are referred to the book just named.\r\n\r\nWhen clovers are sown by hand, usually but one hand is used. Enough seed\r\nis lifted between the thumb and two forefingers of the right hand to\r\nsuffice for scattering by one swing of the same. On the return trip\r\nacross the field the seed should be made to overlap somewhat the seed\r\nsown when going in the opposite direction. In other words, the seed is\r\nsown in strips or bands, as it were, each strip being finished in one\r\nround. Some sowers, more expert at their work, sow with both hands and\r\ncomplete the strip each time they walk over the field. When the ground\r\nis plowed in lands of moderate width the furrows will serve to enable\r\nthe sower to sow in straight lines. Where the sowing is done on land\r\nsown to grain by the drill, the drill marks may be made to effect the\r\nsame result. When sown on light snows, the foot-marks will serve as\r\nguides. In the absence of marks it will be necessary to use stakes to\r\nguide the sower. Four stakes are used, two of which are set at each end\r\nof the field, and these are moved as each cast is made. At each round\r\nmade over the field, from 12 feet to 15 feet may be sown by the sower\r\nwho sows only with one hand. The sower with two hands will accomplish\r\ntwice as much.\r\n\r\nA comparatively still time should be chosen for sowing the seed by hand,\r\nmore especially when grass seeds, which are usually lighter, are sown at\r\nthe same time. In hand sowing much care is necessary in scattering the\r\nseed, so that each cast of the seed will spread evenly as it falls,\r\nleaving no bare spaces between the cast from the hand or between the\r\nstrips sown at one time. Hand sowing, especially in the Western States,\r\nis in a sense a lost art, owing to the extent to which machine sowing is\r\npractised; nevertheless, it is an accomplishment which every farmer\r\nshould possess, since it will oftentimes be found very convenient when\r\nsowing small quantities of seed, and in sowing seeds in mixtures which\r\ncannot be so well sown by machines.\r\n\r\nHand machines are of various kinds. Those most in favor for ordinary\r\nsowing consist of a seeder wheeled over the ground on a frame resembling\r\nthat of a wheelbarrow. It sows about 12 feet in width at each cast of\r\nthe seed. It enables the sower to sow the seed while considerable wind\r\nis blowing and to sow it quite evenly, but it is not adapted to the\r\nsowing of all kinds of grass and clover mixtures, which it may be\r\ndesirable to sow together, since they do not always feed out evenly,\r\nowing to a difference in size, in weight, in shape and in the character\r\nof the covering.\r\n\r\nWhen clover seed is sown with the grain drill, it is sometimes sown\r\nseparately from grain; that is, without a nurse crop, and is deposited\r\nin the soil by the same tubes. But it is only some makes of drills that\r\nwill do this. Clover seed, and especially alfalfa, may be thus sown with\r\nmuch advantage on certain of the Western and Southern soils, especially\r\non those that are light and open in character, and when the seed is to\r\nbe put in without a nurse crop. Eastern soils are usually too heavy to\r\nadmit of depositing the seed thus deeply, but to this there are some\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nWhen sown with a nurse crop, the seed is in some instances mixed with\r\nthe grain before it is sown. In some instances it is mixed before it is\r\nbrought to the field. At other times it is added when the grain has been\r\nput in the seed-box of the drill. This method of sowing is adapted to\r\ncertain soils of the Western prairies and to very open soils in some\r\nother localities, but under average conditions it buries seeds too\r\ndeeply. There is the further objection that they all grow in the line of\r\nthe grain plants and are more shaded than they would be otherwise.\r\nNevertheless, under some conditions this method of sowing the plants is\r\nusually satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOne of the most satisfactory methods of sowing clover seeds along with a\r\nnurse crop is to sow the clover with a \"seeder attachment;\" that is, an\r\nattachment for sowing small seeds, which will deposit the same before or\r\nbehind the grain tubes as may be desired. The seed is thus sown at the\r\nsame time as the grain, and in the process is scattered evenly over the\r\nsurface of the ground. These seeder attachments, however, will not sow\r\nall kinds of clover and grass mixtures any more than will hand-sowing\r\nmachines do the same.\r\n\r\n=Depth to Bury the Seed.=--The depth to bury the seed varies with the\r\nconditions of soil, climate and season. Clover seeds, like those of\r\ngrasses, are buried most deeply in the light soils of the prairie so\r\nlight that they sink, so as to make walking over them unusually tiresome\r\nwhen working on newly plowed land, and in other instances so light as to\r\nlift with the wind. On such soils the seeds may be buried to the depth\r\nof 2 to 3 inches. On loam soils, a covering of 1 inch or less would be\r\nample, and on stiff clays the covering may even be lighter under normal\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nClover seeds are buried more deeply in dry than in moist climates, and\r\nalso more deeply in dry portions of the year than when moisture is\r\nsufficient. While it may be proper in some instances to scatter the\r\nseeds on the surface without any covering other than is furnished by\r\nrain or frost, it will be very necessary at other seasons to provide a\r\ncovering to insure a stand of the seed.\r\n\r\nWhen clover seed is sown on ground honeycombed with frost, no covering\r\nis necessary. When sown on winter grain in the spring, the ground not\r\nbeing so honeycombed, covering with the harrow is usually advantageous.\r\nWhen sown on spring crops and early in the season, it may not be\r\nnecessary to cover the seed, except by using the roller, even though the\r\nseed should fall behind the grain tubes while the grain crop is being\r\nsown, or should be sown subsequently by hand. In other instances the\r\nharrow should be used, and sometimes both the roller and the harrow.\r\nUnder conditions such as appertain to New England and the adjacent\r\nStates to Ontario and the provinces east and to the land west of the\r\nCascade Mountains, clover and also grass seeds do not require so much of\r\na covering as when sown on the prairie soils of the central portion of\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\n=Sowing Alone or in Combinations.=--Whether clover seed should be sown\r\nalone or in combination with the seeds of other grasses will depend upon\r\nthe object sought in sowing it. When sown to produce seed, it is usually\r\nsown without admixture, but not in every instance; when sown to produce\r\nhay, it is nearly always sown in mixtures, but to this there are some\r\nexceptions; when sown to produce pasture, it is almost invariably sown\r\nwith something else; and when sown to enrich the land, it is, in all,\r\nor nearly all, instances, sown without admixture.\r\n\r\nWhen sown primarily to produce seed, there are no good reasons why\r\ntimothy and probably some other grasses may not be sown with medium red\r\nand mammoth clover, when pasture is wanted from the land in the season\r\nor seasons immediately following the production of seed.\r\n\r\nThe presence of these grasses may not seriously retard the growth of the\r\nclover plants until after they have produced seed, and subsequently they\r\nwill grow more assertively and produce pasture as the clover fails.\r\nMoreover, should they mature any seed at the same time that the clover\r\nseeds mature, they may usually be separated in the winnowing process,\r\nowing to a difference in the size of the seeds. But timothy should not\r\nbe sown with alsike clover that is being grown for seed, since the seeds\r\nof these are so nearly alike in size that they cannot be separated.\r\n\r\nWhen hay is wanted, the practice is very common of sowing timothy along\r\nwith the medium red, mammoth and alsike varieties of clover. Timothy\r\ngrows well with each of these; supports them to some extent when likely\r\nto lodge; matures at the same time as the mammoth and alsike clovers;\r\ncomes on more assertively as the clovers begin to fail, thus prolonging\r\nthe period of cropping or pasturing; and feeds upon the roots of the\r\nclovers in their decay.\r\n\r\nNext to timothy, redtop is probably the most useful grass to sow with\r\nthese clovers, and may in some instances be added to timothy in the\r\nmixtures. Some other grasses may also be added under certain conditions,\r\nor substituted for timothy or redtop. In certain instances, it has also\r\nbeen found profitable to mix certain of the clovers in addition to\r\nadding grass seeds when hay is wanted. The more important of these\r\nmixtures will be referred to when treating of growing the different\r\nvarieties in subsequent chapters. When growing them, the aim should be\r\nto sow those varieties together which mature about the same time. The\r\nadvantages from growing them together for hay include larger yields, a\r\nfiner quality of hay, and a more palatable fodder.\r\n\r\nIn the past it has been the almost uniform practice to sow alfalfa\r\nalone, but this practice is becoming modified to some extent, and is\r\nlikely to become more so in the future, especially when grown for\r\npasture.\r\n\r\nWhen sown to produce pasture, unless for one or two seasons, clover seed\r\nis sown in various mixtures of grasses in all or nearly all instances.\r\nThe grasses add to the permanency of the pastures, while the clovers\r\nusually furnish abundant grazing more quickly than the grasses. Several\r\nof them, however, are more short-lived than grasses usually are, hence\r\nthe latter are relied upon to furnish grazing after the clovers have\r\nbegun to fail. In laying down permanent pastures, the seed of several\r\nvarieties is usually sown, but in moderate quantities. The larger the\r\nnumber of the varieties sown that are adapted to the conditions, the\r\nmore varied, the more prolonged and the more ample is the grazing\r\nlikely to be.\r\n\r\nWhen clovers, except the crimson variety, are sown for the exclusive\r\npurpose of adding to the fertility of the land, they are usually sown\r\nalong with some other crop that is to be harvested, the clover being\r\nplowed under the following autumn or the next spring. These are usually\r\nsown without being mixed with other varieties, and the two kinds most\r\nfrequently sown primarily to enrich the land are the medium red and\r\ncrimson varieties. The former grows more quickly than other varieties,\r\nand the latter, usually sown alone, comes after some crop already\r\nharvested, and is buried in time to sow some other crop on the same land\r\nthe following spring.\r\n\r\n=Sowing with or without a Nurse Crop.=--Nearly all varieties of clover\r\nare usually sown with a nurse crop; that is, a crop which provides shade\r\nfor the plants when they are young and delicate. But the object in\r\nsowing with a nurse crop is not so much to secure protection to the\r\nyoung plants as to get them established in the soil, so that they will\r\nproduce a full crop the following season. Two varieties, however, are\r\nmore commonly sown alone. These are alfalfa and crimson clover.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is more commonly sown alone because the young plants are\r\nsomewhat delicate and easily crowded out by other plants amid which they\r\nare growing. Because of the several years during which alfalfa will\r\nproduce crops when once established, it is deemed proper to sacrifice a\r\nnurse crop in order to get a good stand of the young plants. The other\r\nclovers are usually able to make a sufficient stand, though grown along\r\nwith a nurse crop. In some situations alfalfa will also do similarly,\r\nas, for instance, where the conditions are very favorable to its growth.\r\nCrimson clover is more commonly sown alone for the reason, first, that\r\nit is frequently sown at a season when other crops are not being sown;\r\nsecond, that it grows better without a nurse crop; and third, that if\r\ngrown with a nurse crop the latter would have to be used in the same way\r\nas the clover.\r\n\r\nSome have advocated sowing clovers without a nurse crop under any\r\nconditions. Such advocacy in the judgment of the author is not wise. It\r\nis true that in some instances a stand of the various clovers is more\r\ncertainly assured when they are sown without a nurse crop, but in such\r\nsituations it is at least questionable if it would not be better to sow\r\nsome other crop as a substitute for clover. But there may be instances,\r\nas where clover will make a good crop of hay the year that it is sown,\r\nwhen sowing it thus would be justifiable. In a majority of instances,\r\nhowever, it will not make such a crop, because of the presence of weeds,\r\nwhich, in the first place, would hinder growth, and in the second, would\r\ninjure the quality of the hay.\r\n\r\nThe nurse crops with which clovers may be sown are the small cereal\r\ngrains, as rye, barley, wheat and oats. Sometimes they are sown with\r\nflax, rape and millet. They usually succeed best when sown along with\r\nrye and barley, since these shade them less and are cut earlier, thus\r\nmaking less draft on moisture in the soil and admitting sunlight at an\r\nearlier period. Oats make the least advantageous nurse crop, because of\r\nthe denseness of the shade, but if they are sown thinly and cut for hay\r\nsoon after they come into head, they are then a very suitable nurse\r\ncrop. One chief objection to flax as a nurse crop is that it is commonly\r\nsown late. The chief virtue in rape as a nurse crop is that the shade is\r\nremoved early through pasturing. The millets are objectionable as nurse\r\ncrops through the denseness of the shade which they furnish and also\r\nbecause of the heavy draught which they make on soil moisture. Peas and\r\nvetches should not be used as nurse crops, since they smother the young\r\nclover plants through lodging in the advanced stages of their growth.\r\n\r\n=Amounts of Seed to Sow.=--The amounts of clover seed to sow are\r\ninfluenced by the object sought in sowing; by combinations with which\r\nthe seeds are sown, and by the relative size of the seeds. The soil and\r\nclimate should also be considered, although these influences are\r\nprobably less important than those first named.\r\n\r\nWhen clovers are sown for pasture only, or to fertilize the soil\r\nspeedily and to supply it with humus, the largest amounts of seed are\r\nsown. But for these purposes it is seldom necessary to use more than 12\r\npounds of seed per acre. These amounts refer to the medium red and\r\nmammoth varieties, which are more frequently used than the other\r\nvarieties for the purposes named. They also include the crimson sown\r\nusually to fertilize the soil. When sown to provide seed only, 12 pounds\r\nper acre of the medium red, mammoth and crimson varieties will usually\r\nsuffice. Half the quantity of alsike will be enough, and one-third the\r\nquantity of the small white, or a little more than that. Whether alfalfa\r\nis grown for seed, for hay or for pasture, about the same amounts of\r\nseed are used; that is, 15 to 20 pounds per acre. When sown with nurse\r\ncrops and simply to improve the soil, it is customary to sow small\r\nrather than large quantities of seed, and for the reason that the hazard\r\nof failure to secure a stand every season is too considerable to justify\r\nthe outlay. From 4 to 5 pounds per acre are frequently sown and of the\r\nmedium or mammoth variety.\r\n\r\nWhen the mammoth and medium varieties of clover are sown for hay with\r\none or two kinds of grass only, it is not common to sow more than 6 to 8\r\npounds of either per acre. The maximum amount of the seed of the alsike\r\nrequired when thus sown with grasses may be set down at 5 pounds per\r\nacre. These three varieties are chiefly used for such mixtures. With\r\nmore varieties of grass in the mixtures, the quantities of clover seed\r\nused will decrease. When clovers are sown with mixtures intended for\r\npermanent pastures, it would not be possible to name the amounts of seed\r\nto sow without knowing the grasses used also, but it may be said that,\r\nas a rule, in those mixtures, the clovers combined seldom form more than\r\none-third of the seed used.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of some varieties of clover are less than one-third of the\r\nsize of other varieties. This, therefore, affects proportionately, or at\r\nleast approximately so, the amounts of seed required. For instance,\r\nwhile it might be proper to sow 12 pounds of medium or mammoth clover to\r\naccomplish a certain result, less than one-third of the quantity of the\r\nsmall white variety would suffice for the same end.\r\n\r\nThe influences of climate and soil on the quantities of seed required\r\nare various, so various that to consider them fully here would unduly\r\nprolong the discussion. But it may be said that the harder the\r\nconditions in both respects, the more the quantity of seed required and\r\n_vice versa_.\r\n\r\n=Pasturing.=--When clover seed is sown in nurse crops that are matured\r\nbefore being harvested, the pasturing of the stand secured the autumn\r\nfollowing is usually to be avoided. Removing the covering which the\r\nplants have provided for themselves is against their passing through the\r\nwinter in the best form. In some instances the injury proves so serious\r\nas to result in a loss of all, or nearly all, the plants. The colder the\r\nwinters, the less the normal snowfall and the more the deficiency of\r\nmoisture, the greater is the hazard. But in some instances so great is\r\nthe growth of the clover plants that not to graze them down in part at\r\nleast would incur the danger of smothering many of the plants,\r\nespecially in regions where the snowfall is at all considerable.\r\n\r\nBut when the seed is sown alone or in mixtures of grain and even of\r\nother grasses in the spring, grazing the same season will have the\r\neffect of strengthening the plants. This result is due chiefly to the\r\nremoval of the shade that weeds and other plants would furnish were\r\nthey not thus eaten down, but it is also due in part to the larger share\r\nof soil moisture that is thus left for the clover plants. Pasturing\r\nclover sown thus should be avoided when the ground is so wet as to poach\r\nor become impact in consequence. Unless on light, spongy soils which\r\nreadily lose their moisture, such grazing should not begin until the\r\nplants have made considerable growth, nor should it be too close, or\r\nroot development in the pastures will be hindered.\r\n\r\nIt would not be possible to fix the stage of growth when the grazing\r\nshould begin on clover fields kept for pasture subsequent to the season\r\nof sowing. The largest amount of food would be furnished if grazing were\r\ndeferred until the blossoming stage were reached and the crop were then\r\ngrazed down quickly. But this is not usually practicable, hence the\r\ngrazing usually begins at a period considerably earlier. In general,\r\nhowever, the plants should not be grazed down very closely, or growth\r\nwill be more or less hindered.\r\n\r\nGrazing clover in the spring and somewhat closely for several weeks\r\nafter growth begins, has been thought conducive to abundant seed\r\nproduction. This result is due probably to the greater increase in the\r\nseed heads that follow such grazing. This would seem to explain why\r\nclover that has been judiciously grazed produces even more seed than\r\nthat clipped off by the mower after it has begun to grow freely.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all localities the grazing of medium red clover, and even of\r\nmammoth clover, somewhat closely in the autumn of the second year, is to\r\nbe practised rather than avoided. These two varieties being essentially\r\nbiennial in their habit of growth will not usually survive the second\r\nwinter, even though not grazed, hence not to graze them would result in\r\na loss of the pasture.\r\n\r\nWith nearly all kinds of clover there is some danger from bloat in\r\ngrazing them with cattle or sheep while yet quite succulent, and the\r\ndanger is intensified when the animals are turned in to graze with empty\r\nstomachs or when the clover is wet with dew or rain. When such bloating\r\noccurs, for the method of procedure see page 95. The danger that bloat\r\nwill be produced is lessened in proportion as other grasses abound in\r\nthe pastures.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting.=--All the varieties of clover, except alfalfa, are best cut\r\nfor hay when in full bloom. Here and there a head may have turned brown.\r\nIf cut earlier, the crop is difficult to cure, nor will it contain a\r\nmaximum of nutriment. If cut later it loses much in palatability.\r\nAlfalfa should be cut a little earlier, or just when it is nicely coming\r\ninto bloom, as if cut later the shedding of the leaves in the curing is\r\nlikely to be large.\r\n\r\nAll clovers are much injured by exposure to rain or dew. They will also\r\nlose much if cured in the swath, without being frequently stirred with\r\nthe tedder; that is, it will take serious injury if cured in the swath\r\nas it fell from the mower. If cured thus, it will lose in aroma and\r\npalatability, through the breaking of leaves and, consequently, in\r\nfeeding value. To avoid these losses, clover is more frequently cured in\r\nthe cock. When cured thus, it preserves the bright green color, the\r\naroma and the tint of the blossoms, it is less liable to heat in the mow\r\nor stack and is greatly relished by live stock when fed to them.\r\n\r\nTo cure it thus, it is usually tedded once or twice after it has lost\r\nsome of its moisture. It is then raked as soon as it is dried enough to\r\nrake easily, and put up into cocks. When the quantity to be cured is not\r\nlarge caps are sometimes used to cover the cocks to shed the rain when\r\nthe weather is showery. These are simply square strips of some kind of\r\nmaterial that will shed rain, weighted at the corners to keep them from\r\nblowing away. The clover remains in the cocks for two or three days, or\r\nuntil it has gone through the \"sweating\" process. Exposure to two or\r\nthree showers of rain falling at intervals while partially cured in the\r\nswath or winrow will greatly injure clover hay.\r\n\r\nWhen the area to be harvested is large, clover is sometimes cured in the\r\nswath. When thus cured it is stirred with the tedder often enough to aid\r\nin curing the hay quickly. It is then raked into winrows and drawn from\r\nthese to the place of storage. In good weather clover may be cured thus\r\nso as to make fairly good hay, but not so good as is made by the other\r\nmethod of curing. It is much more expeditiously made, but there is some\r\nloss in leaves, in color and in palatability.\r\n\r\nSome farmers cure clover by allowing it to wilt a little after it is\r\ncut, and then drawing and storing it in a large mow. They claim that it\r\nmust be entirely free from rain or dew when thus stored. This plan of\r\ncuring clover has been successfully practised by some farmers for many\r\nyears; others who have tried it have failed, which makes it evident that\r\nwhen stored thus, close attention must be given to all the details\r\nessential to success.\r\n\r\nClover may also be cured in the silo. While some have succeeded in\r\nmaking good ensilage, in many cases it has not proved satisfactory. The\r\ntime may come when the conditions to be observed in making good silage\r\nfrom clover will be such that the element of hazard in making the same\r\nwill be removed. In the meantime, it will usually be more satisfactory\r\nto cure clover in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nGrasses cure more easily and more quickly than clovers. Consequently,\r\nwhen these are grown together so that the grasses form a considerable\r\nproportion of the hay, the methods followed in curing the grasses will\r\nanswer also for the clovers. For these methods the reader is referred to\r\nthe book \"Grasses and How to Grow Them\" by the author. The influence\r\nthat grasses thus exert on the growing of clovers furnishes a weighty\r\nreason for growing them together.\r\n\r\n=Storing.=--Clovers are ready to store when enough moisture has left the\r\nstems to prevent excessive fermentation when put into the place of\r\nstorage. Hay that has been cured in the cock is much less liable to heat\r\nwhen stored so as to produce mould, than hay cured in the swath or\r\nwinrow. The former has already gone through the heating process or, at\r\nleast, partially so. Some experience is necessary to enable one to be\r\nquite sure as to the measure of the fitness of hay for being stored.\r\nWhen it can be pitched without excessive labor it is ready for being\r\nstored, but the unskilled will not likely be able to judge of this\r\naccurately. If a wisp is taken some distance from the top of the winrow\r\nor cock and twisted between the hands, if moisture exudes it is too\r\ndamp, and if the hay breaks asunder readily it is too dry. When no\r\nmoisture is perceptible and yet the wisp does not break asunder, the hay\r\nis ready to be drawn. Care must be taken that the wisp chosen be\r\nrepresentative of the mass of the hay. To make sure of this, the test\r\nshould be applied several times.\r\n\r\nWhere practicable the aim should be to store clover hay under cover,\r\nowing to the little power which it has to shed rain in the stack. This\r\nis only necessary, however, in climates with considerable rainfall\r\nduring the year and where irrigation is practised, as in the mountain\r\nStates clover hay may be kept in the stack without any loss from rain,\r\nand it can be cured exactly as the ranchman may desire, since he is\r\nnever embarrassed when making hay by bad weather. When storing clovers,\r\nthe time of the day at which it is stored influences the keeping\r\nqualities of the hay. Hay stored at noontide may keep properly, whereas,\r\nif the same were stored while dew is falling it might be too damp for\r\nbeing thus stored.\r\n\r\nMuch care should be taken in stacking clover hay that it may shed rain\r\nproperly. The following should be observed among other rules of less\r\nimportance that may be given: 1. Make a foundation of rails, poles or\r\nold straw or hay that will prevent the hay near the ground from taking\r\ninjury from the ground moisture. 2. Keep the heart of the stack highest\r\nfrom the first and the slope gradual and even from the center toward the\r\nsides. 3. Keep the stack evenly trodden, or it will settle unevenly, and\r\nthe stack will lean to one side accordingly. 4. Increase the diameter\r\nfrom the ground upward until ready to draw in or narrow to form the top.\r\n5. Aim to form the top by gradual rather than abrupt narrowing. 6. Top\r\nout by using some other kind of hay or grass that sheds the rain better\r\nthan clover. 7. Suspend weights to some kind of ropes, stretching over\r\nthe top of the stack to prevent the wind from removing the material put\r\non to protect the clover from rain.\r\n\r\n=Feeding.=--The clovers furnish a ration more nearly in balance than\r\nalmost any other kind of food. If the animals to which they are fed\r\ncould consume enough of them to produce the desired end, concentrated\r\nfoods would not be wanted. They are so bulky, however, relatively, that\r\nto horses and mules at work, to dairy cows in milk and cattle that are\r\nbeing fattened, to sheep under similar conditions, and to swine, it is\r\nnecessary to add the concentrated grain foods, more or less, according\r\nto the precise object. But for horses, mules, cattle, sheep and goats\r\nthat are growing subsequent to the weaning stage, and for mature animals\r\nof these respective classes not producing, that is, not yielding\r\nreturns, a good quality of clover hay will suffice for a considerable\r\ntime at least without the necessity of adding any other food.\r\n\r\nIt is considered inferior to timothy as a fodder for horses. This\r\npreference is doubtless owing largely to the fact, first, that clover\r\nbreaks up more and loses more leaves when being handled, especially when\r\nbeing transported; and second, that clover is frequently cured so\r\nimperfectly as to create dust from over-fermentation or through breaking\r\nof the leaves, because of being over-dried, and the dust thus created is\r\nprejudicial to the health of these animals. It tends to produce\r\n\"heaves.\" This may in part be obviated by sprinkling the hay before it\r\nis fed. When clover is properly cured, it is a more nutritious hay than\r\ntimothy, and is so far preferable for horses, but since timothy\r\ntransports in much better form, it is always likely to be more popular\r\nin the general market than clover. The possibility of feeding clover to\r\nhorses for successive years without any evils resulting is made very\r\napparent from feeding alfalfa thus in certain areas of the West.\r\n\r\nClover hay is specially useful as a fodder for milk-producing animals,\r\nowing to the high protein content which it contains. Dairymen prefer it\r\nto nearly all kinds of fodders grown, and the same is true of shepherds.\r\nWhen very coarse, however, a considerable proportion of the stems is\r\nlikely to be left uneaten, especially by sheep. Because of this it\r\nshould be the aim to grow it so that this coarseness of stem will not be\r\npresent. This is accomplished, first, by growing it thickly, and second,\r\nby growing the clovers in combination with one another and also with\r\ncertain of the grasses.\r\n\r\nClovers are especially helpful in balancing the ration where corn is the\r\nprincipal food crop grown. The protein of the clover crop aids greatly\r\nin balancing the excess of carbo-hydrates in the corn crop, hence much\r\nattention should be given to the production of clovers in such areas.\r\n\r\n=Renewing.=--Because of the comparatively short life of several of the\r\nmost useful of the varieties of clover, no attempt is usually made to\r\nrenew them when they fail, unless when growing in pasture somewhat\r\npermanent in character. To this, however, there may be some exceptions.\r\nOn certain porous soils it has been found possible to maintain medium\r\nred clover and also the mammoth and alsike varieties for several years\r\nby simply allowing some of the seed to ripen in the autumn, and in this\r\nway to re-seed the land, a result made possible through moderate grazing\r\nof the meadow in the autumn, and in some instances through the absence\r\nof grazing altogether, as when the conditions may not be specially\r\nfavorable to the growth of clover.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon, however, to renew alfalfa, by adding more seed when\r\nit is disked in the spring, as it sometimes is to aid in removing weeds\r\nfrom the land. The results vary much with the favorableness of the\r\nconditions for growing alfalfa or the opposite.\r\n\r\nIn pastures more or less permanent in character, clovers may be renewed\r\nby disking the ground, adding more clover seed, and then smoothing the\r\nsurface by running over it the harrow, and in some instances also the\r\nroller. This work is best done when the frost has just left the ground\r\nfor a short distance below the surface.\r\n\r\nSome kinds of clover are so persistent in their habit of growth that\r\nwhen once in the soil they remain, and therefore do not usually require\r\nrenewal. These include the small white, the yellow, the Japan, burr\r\nclover and sweet clover. In soils congenial to these respective\r\nvarieties, the seeds usually remain in the soil in sufficient quantities\r\nto restock the land with plants when it is again laid down to grass.\r\nNearly all of these varieties are persistent seed producers; hence, even\r\nthough grazed, enough seed is formed to produce another crop of plants.\r\n\r\n=Clovers as Soil Improvers.=--All things considered, no class of plants\r\ngrown upon the farm are so beneficent in the influence which they exert\r\nupon the land as clovers. They improve it by enriching it; they improve\r\nit mechanically; and they aid plant growth by gathering and\r\nassimilating, as it were, food for other plants.\r\n\r\nAll clovers have the power of drawing nitrogen from the air and\r\ndepositing the same in the tubercles formed on the roots of the plants.\r\nThese tubercles are small, warty-like substances, which appear during\r\nthe growing season. They are more commonly formed on the roots within\r\nthe cultivable area, and therefore are easily accessible to the roots of\r\nthe plants which immediately follow. Clovers are not equally capable of\r\nthus drawing nitrogen from the air, nor are the same varieties equally\r\ncapable of doing this under varying conditions. The relative\r\ncapabilities of varieties to thus deposit nitrogen in the soil is by no\r\nmeans equal, but up to the present time it would seem correct to say\r\nthat relative capability in all of these has not yet been definitely\r\nascertained. With reference to the whole question much has yet to be\r\nlearned, but it is now certain that in all, or nearly all, instances in\r\nwhich clovers are grown on land, they leave it much richer in nitrogen\r\nthan it was when they were sown upon the same.\r\n\r\nThey also add to the fertility of the surface soil by gathering plant\r\nfood in the subsoil below where many plants feed. They have much power\r\nto do this, because they are deep rooted and they are strong feeders;\r\nthat is, they have much power to take up food in the soil or subsoil.\r\nPart of the food thus gathered in the subsoil helps to form roots in the\r\ncultivable area and part aids in forming top growth for pasture or for\r\nhay. If grazed down or if made into hay and fed so that the manure goes\r\nback upon the land the fertility of the same is increased in all leading\r\nessentials. This increase is partly made at the expense of the fertility\r\nin the subsoil. But the stores of fertility in the subsoil are such\r\nusually as to admit of thus being drawn upon indefinitely.\r\n\r\nClovers improve soils mechanically by rendering them more friable, by\r\ngiving them increased power to hold moisture, and by improving drainage\r\nin the subsoil. Of course, they have not the power to do this equally,\r\nbut they all have this power in degree and in all the ways that have\r\nbeen named.\r\n\r\nClovers send down a tap root into the soil and subsoil as they grow.\r\nFrom the tap roots branch off lateral roots in an outward and downward\r\ndirection. From these laterals many rootlets penetrate through the soil.\r\nWhen the plants are numerous, these roots and rootlets fill the soil.\r\nWhen it is broken up, therefore, particles of soil are so separated that\r\nthey tend to fall apart, hence the soil is always made more or less\r\nfriable, even when it consists of the stiffest clays. The shade\r\nfurnished by the clover also furthers friability. This friability makes\r\nthe land easier to work, and it is also more easily penetrated by the\r\nroots of plants. The influence on aeration is also marked. The air can\r\nmore readily penetrate through the interstices in the soil, and, in\r\nconsequence, chemical changes in the soil favorable to plant growth are\r\nfacilitated.\r\n\r\nThe roots of clovers are usually so numerous that they literally fill\r\nthe soil with vegetable matter. This matter, in process of decay,\r\ngreatly increases the power of the soil to hold moisture, whether it\r\nfalls from the clouds or ascends from the subsoil through capillary\r\nattraction. The moisture thus held is greatly beneficial to the plants\r\nthat immediately follow, especially in a dry season and in open soils,\r\nand the influence thus exerted frequently goes on, though with\r\ndecreasing potency, for two, three or four seasons.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the tap root which clover sends down\r\ninto the soil and subsoil. In the strong varieties this tap root goes\r\ndown deeply. When the crop is plowed up, the roots decay, and when they\r\ndo, for a time at least, they furnish channels down which the surface\r\nwater percolates, if present in excess. Thus it is that clover aids in\r\ndraining lands under the conditions named. The channels thus opened do\r\nnot close immediately with the decay of the clover roots, hence the\r\ndownward movement of water in the soil is facilitated for some time\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that clovers have more power than some other plants\r\nto gather plant food in the soil. In some instances they literally fill\r\nthe soil with their roots. When other plants are sown after the clover\r\nhas been broken up they feed richly on the decaying roots of the clover.\r\nThus it is that clover gathers food for other plants which they would\r\nnot be so well able to gather for themselves, and puts it in a form in\r\nwhich it can be easily appropriated by these. The nitrogen in clover is\r\nyielded up more gradually and continuously as nitrates than it could be\r\nobtained from any form of top dressings that can be given to the land.\r\nIn this fact is found one important reason why cereal grains thrive so\r\nwell after clover.\r\n\r\nSince the roots of clovers act so beneficently on soils, it is highly\r\nimportant that they be increased to the greatest extent practicable.\r\nOwing to the relation between the growth of the roots of plants and the\r\nparts produced above ground, development in root growth is promoted much\r\nmore when the clover is cut for hay than when it is fed off by grazing.\r\nExperiments have also demonstrated that the development of root growth\r\nis much enhanced in medium red clover by taking a second cutting for\r\nhay or seed. They have also demonstrated that more nitrogen is left in\r\nthe soil by clover roots after a seed crop than after a crop of hay.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it will be apparent that the extent to which\r\nclovers enrich the soil will depend upon the strength of the growth of\r\nthe plants and certain other conditions. It will not be possible to\r\nreduce to figures the additions in plant food which clovers add to the\r\nsoil other than in a comparative way. Dr. Voelker has stated that there\r\nis fully three times as much nitrogen in a crop of clover as in the\r\naverage produce of the grain and straw of wheat per acre. Dr. Kedzie is\r\non record as having said that in the hay or sod furnished by a good crop\r\nof clover, there is enough nitrogen for more than four average crops of\r\nwheat, enough phosphoric acid for more than two average crops and enough\r\nof potash for more than six average crops. He has said, moreover, that\r\nthe roots and stubble contain fully as much of these elements as hay.\r\n\r\nIt will also be apparent that where clover grows in good form no cheaper\r\nor better way can be adopted in manuring land, and that in certain areas\r\nthe judicious use of land plaster on the clover hastens the renovating\r\nprocess. It is thought that in some instances the mere loading and\r\nspreading of barnyard manure costs more than the clover and plaster.\r\nEspecially will this be true of fields distant from the farm steading.\r\nIt is specially important, therefore, that in enriching these, clover\r\nwill be utilized to the fullest extent practicable.\r\n\r\n=Clover as a Weed Destroyer.=--Where clover is much grown, at least in\r\nsome of its varieties, it becomes an aid in reducing the prevalence of\r\nmany forms of weed growth. It is thus helpful in some instances, because\r\nof the number of the cuttings secured; in others because of its\r\nsmothering tendencies, and in yet others because of the season of the\r\nyear when it is sown and harvested or plowed under, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa and medium red clover are cut more frequently than the other\r\nvarieties and, therefore, because of this, render more service than\r\nthese in checking weed growth. The former is cut so frequently as to\r\nmake it practically impossible for most forms of annual weed life to\r\nmature seed in the crop. The same is true of biennials and also\r\nperennials. But there are some forms of perennial weeds which multiply\r\nthrough the medium of their rootstocks that may eventually crowd\r\nalfalfa. Medium red clover is usually cut twice a year, hence, in it\r\nannuals and biennials cannot mature seed, except in exceptional\r\ninstances, and because of the short duration of its life, perennials\r\nhave not time to spread so as to do much harm.\r\n\r\nThe clovers that are most helpful in smothering weeds are the mammoth,\r\nthe medium and the alsike varieties. These are thus helpful in the order\r\nnamed. To accomplish such an end they must grow vigorously, and the\r\nplants must be numerous on the ground. When grown thus, but few forms of\r\nweed life can make any material headway in the clover crop. Even\r\nperennials may be greatly weakened, and in some instances virtually\r\nsmothered by such growth of clover. To insure a sufficient growth of\r\nclover it may be advantageous to top dress the crop with farmyard manure\r\nsufficiently decayed, and in the case of medium red clover to dress the\r\nsecond cutting with land plaster. If the second growth is plowed under,\r\nsubsequent cultivation of the surface will further aid in completing the\r\nwork of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe crimson variety is sown and also harvested at such a time that the\r\ninfluence on weed eradication is very marked. The ground is usually\r\nprepared in the summer and so late that weeds which sprout after the\r\nclover has been sown cannot mature the same autumn. In the spring it is\r\nharvested before any weeds can ripen. When plowed under, rather than\r\nharvested, the result is the same.\r\n\r\nWhen clover is grown in short rotations, its power to destroy weeds is\r\nincreased. For instance, when the medium red or mammoth varieties are\r\ngrown in the three years' rotation of corn or some root crop, followed\r\nby grain seeded with clover, the effects upon weed eradication are very\r\nmarked, if the cultivation given to the corn or roots is ample. Under\r\nsuch a system weeds could be virtually prevented from maturing seeds at\r\nany time, especially if the medium variety of clover were sown, and if\r\nthe stubbles were mown some time subsequent to the harvesting of the\r\ngrain crop. Such a system of rotation faithfully carried out for a\r\nnumber of years should practically eradicate all, or nearly all, the\r\nnoxious forms of weed life.\r\n\r\n=Clover Sickness.=--On certain of the soils of Great Britain and\r\nprobably on those of other countries in Europe, where clover has been\r\ngrown quite frequently and for a long period, as good crops cannot be\r\ngrown as previously, and in some instances the crop is virtually a\r\nfailure. The plants will start from seed in the early spring and grow\r\nwith sufficient vigor for a time, after which they will show signs of\r\nwilting and finally they die. Various theories were advanced for a time\r\nas to the cause before it was ascertained by experiment what produced\r\nthese results. Some thought they arose from lack of water in the soil,\r\nothers claimed that they were due to the presence of parasites, which in\r\nsome way preyed upon the roots, others again attributed them to improper\r\nsoil conditions. It is now just about certain that they arose from a\r\ndeficiency of soluble potash in the subsoil. Such, at least, was the\r\nconclusion reached by Kutzleb as the result of experiments conducted\r\nwith a view to ascertain the cause of clover wilt.\r\n\r\nThe cause being known, the remedy is not difficult. It is to grow clover\r\nless frequently on such soils. Sufficient time must be given to enable\r\nmore of the inert potash in the subsoil to become available. Another way\r\nwould be to apply potash somewhat freely to these soils, and subsoil\r\nthem where this may be necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that clover sickness is as yet unknown in the United\r\nStates and Canada, although its presence had sometimes been suspected in\r\nsome sections where clover has been much grown. This does not mean that\r\nit may not yet come to this country. Should the symptoms given above\r\nappear on soils on which clover has been grown frequently and for a long\r\nperiod, it would be the part of wisdom to take such indications as a\r\nhint to grow clover less frequently in the rotation.\r\n\r\n=Possible Improvement in Clovers.=--Some close observers have noticed\r\nthat there is much lack of uniformity in the plants found growing in an\r\nordinary field of clover, especially of the medium red and mammoth\r\nvarieties. Many of the plants vary in characteristics of stem, leaf,\r\nflower and seed; in the size and vigor of the plants; in the rapidity\r\nwith which they grow; and in earliness or lateness in maturing. So great\r\nare these differences that it may be said they run all the way from\r\nalmost valueless to high excellence. Here, then, is a wide-open door of\r\nopportunity for improving clover plants through selection. This question\r\nhas not been given that attention in the past which its importance\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nThere may be a difference in view as to all the essential features of\r\nimprovement that are to be sought for, but there will probably be\r\nagreement with reference to the following in desirable varieties: 1.\r\nThey will have the power to grow quickly and continuously under average\r\nconditions. This power will render them valuable as pasture plants in\r\nproportion as they possess it. 2. They will produce many stems not too\r\ncoarse in character. This will affect favorably the character of the hay\r\nand will also have a bearing on increase in the production of seed. 3.\r\nThere should be an abundance of leaves. Such production will affect\r\nfavorably palatability in the pasture and also in the hay. 4. The\r\nblossoms should be so short that the honey which they contain may be\r\naccessible to the ordinary honey bee. The importance of this\r\ncharacteristic cannot be easily overestimated. It would not only tend to\r\na great increase in seed production through the favorable influence\r\nwhich it would have on fertilization, but it would greatly increase the\r\nhoney harvest that would be gathered every year, and 5. They should be\r\npossessed of much vigor and hardihood; that is, they should have much\r\npower to grow under adverse conditions, as of drought and cold. The\r\nperson who will furnish a variety of red clover possessed of these\r\ncharacteristics will confer a boon on American agriculture.\r\n\r\n=Bacteria and Clovers.=--The fact has long been known, even as long ago\r\nas the days of Pliny, and probably much before those days, that clover,\r\nwhen grown in the rotation, had the power to bring fertility to the\r\nsoil. This fact was generally recognized in modern agriculture and to\r\nthe extent, in some instances, of giving it a place even in the short\r\nrotations. But until recent decades, it was only partially known how\r\nclover accomplished such fertilization. It was thought it thus gathered\r\nfertility by feeding deeply in the subsoil, and through the plant food\r\nthus gathered, the root system of the plants were so strengthened in the\r\ncultivated surface section of soil as to account for the increased\r\nproduction in the plants that followed clover. According to this view,\r\nthe stems and leaves of the plants were thus equally benefited and,\r\nconsequently, when these were plowed under where they had grown these\r\nalso added plant food to the cultivated portion of the soil, in addition\r\nto what it possessed when the clover seed which produced the plants was\r\nsown upon it. In brief, this theory claimed that fertility was added by\r\nthe clover plants gathering fertility in the subsoil and depositing it\r\nso near the surface that it became easily accessible to the roots of\r\nother plants sown after the clover and which had not the same power of\r\nfeeding so deeply. This theory was true in part. The three important\r\nelements of plant food, nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash, were and\r\nare thus increased in the soil, but this does not account for the source\r\nfrom which the greater portion of the nitrogen thus deposited in the\r\nsoil was drawn, as will be shown below.\r\n\r\nIt was also noticed that when the seed of any variety of clover was sown\r\non certain soils, the plants would grow with more or less vigor for a\r\ntime and then they would fail to make progress, and in some instances\r\nwould perish. It was further noticed that if farmyard manure was applied\r\nfreely to such land, the growth made was more vigorous. Yet, again, it\r\nwas noticed that by sowing clover at short intervals on such soils, the\r\nimprovement in the growth of the plants was constant. But it was not\r\nunderstood why clover plants behaved thus under the conditions named. It\r\nis now known that ill success at the first was owing to the lack of\r\ncertain micro-organisms, more commonly termed bacteria, in the soil,\r\nthe presence of which are essential to enable clover plants to secure\r\nadditional nitrogen to that found in the soil and subsoil on which to\r\nfeed. When manure was applied, as stated above, the clover plants\r\nsecured much or all of their nitrogen from the manure. Bacteria were\r\nintroduced in very limited numbers at first, it may be through the\r\nmedium of the seed or in some other way, and because of an inherent\r\npower which they possess to increase rapidly in connection with\r\ncontinued sowing of clover at short intervals, they came at length to be\r\nso numerous in the soil as to make possible the growth of good crops of\r\nclover where these could not be thus grown a few years previously.\r\n\r\nCareful observers had noticed that certain warty-like substances were\r\nfound attached to the roots of clover plants, and that the more\r\nvigorously the plants grew, the larger and more numerous were these\r\nsubstances, as a rule. It was thought by many that these warty\r\nsubstances, now spoken of as nodules, were caused by worms biting the\r\nroots or because of some unfavorable climatic influence or abnormal\r\ncondition of soil. It is now known that they are owing to the presence\r\nof bacteria, whose special function is the assimilation of free nitrogen\r\nobtained in the air found in the interstices; that is, the air spaces\r\nbetween the particles of soil. This they store up in the nodules for the\r\nuse of the clover plants and also the crops that shall follow them.\r\n\r\nThe nodules in clover plants vary in size, from a pin head to that of a\r\npea, and they are frequently present in large numbers. Bacteria are\r\npresent within them in countless myriads. They gain an entrance into\r\nthe plant through the root hairs. The exact way in which benefit thus\r\ncomes to the clover plants is not fully understood, but it is now quite\r\ngenerally conceded that the nitrogen taken in by these minute forms of\r\nlife is converted into soluble compounds, which are stored in the\r\ntissues of the roots, stems and leaves of the plants, thus furnishing an\r\nexplanation to the increased vigor. It cannot be definitely ascertained\r\nat present, if, indeed, ever, what proportion of the nitrogen in clover\r\nis taken from the air and from the soil, respectively, since it will\r\nvary with conditions, but when these are normal, it is almost certain\r\nthat by far the larger proportion comes from the air. But it has been\r\nnoticed that when soil is freely supplied with nitrogen, as in liberal\r\napplications of farmyard manure, the plants do not form nodules so\r\nfreely as when nitrogen is less plentiful in the soil. The inference\r\nwould, therefore, seem to be correct, that when plants are well supplied\r\nwith nitrogen in the soil they are less diligent, so to speak, in\r\ngathering it from the air. In other words, clover plants will take more\r\nnitrogen from the air when the soil is more or less nitrogen hungry than\r\nwhen nitrogen abounds in the soil. And yet the plants should be able to\r\nget some nitrogen from the soil in addition to what the seed furnishes\r\nto give them a vigorous start.\r\n\r\nThis power to form tubercles, and thus to store up nitrogen, is by no\r\nmeans confined to clovers. It is possessed by all legumes, as peas,\r\nbeans and vetches. It is claimed that some of these, as soy beans, cow\r\npeas and velvet beans, have even greater power to gather nitrogen from\r\nthe air and store it in the soil than clover, since the nodules formed\r\non the roots of these are frequently larger. In some instances, on the\r\nroots of the velvet bean they grow in clusters as large as an ordinary\r\npotato. With reference to all these leguminous plants it has been\r\ndemonstrated that under proper conditions good crops may be grown and\r\nremoved from the soil and leave it much richer in nitrogen than when the\r\nseed was sown. It is thus possible by sowing these crops at suitable\r\nintervals to keep the soil sufficiently supplied with nitrogen to grow\r\ngood crops other than legumes, adapted to the locality, without the\r\nnecessity for purchasing the nitrogen of commerce in any of its forms.\r\nThey may be made to more than maintain the supply of nitrogen,\r\nnotwithstanding the constant loss of the same by leeching down into the\r\nsubsoil in the form of nitrates, and through the more or less constant\r\nescape of the same into the air in the form of ammonia, during those\r\nportions of the year when the ground is not frozen.\r\n\r\nThey will do this in addition to the food supplies which they furnish,\r\nhence they may be made to supply this most important element of\r\nfertility, and by far the most costly when purchased in the market,\r\nvirtually without cost. The favorable influences which these plants thus\r\nexert upon crop production is invaluable to the farmer. They make it\r\npossible for him to be almost entirely independent of the nitrogen of\r\ncommerce, which, at the rate of consumption during recent years, will\r\nsoon be so far reduced as to be a comparatively insignificant factor in\r\nits relation to crop production. It is possible, however, and not\r\naltogether improbable, that by the aid of electricity a manufactured\r\nnitrate of soda or of potash may be put upon the market at a price which\r\nwill put it within reach of the farmer. The power of legumes to increase\r\nthe nitrogen content in the soil should allay apprehension with\r\nreference to the possible exhaustion of the world's supply of nitrogen,\r\nnotwithstanding the enormous waste of the same in various ways.\r\n\r\nThe more common sources of loss in nitrogen are, first, through the\r\nleeching of nitrates into the drainage water; second, through oxidation;\r\nthird, through the use of explosives in war; and fourth, through the\r\nwaste of the sewerage of cities. When plant and animal products are\r\nchanged into soluble nitrates, they are usually soon lost to the soil,\r\nunless taken up by the roots of plants. When vegetable matter on or near\r\nthe surface of the ground is broken down and decomposed, in the process\r\nof oxidation, there is frequently much loss of nitrogen, as in the rapid\r\ndecomposition of farmyard manure in the absence of some material, as\r\nland plaster, to arrest and hold the escaping ammonia. Through\r\nexplosives used in war there is an enormous vegetable loss of nitrogen,\r\nas nitrate salts, which should rather be used to preserve and sustain\r\nlife than to destroy it. The waste of nitrogen through the loss of\r\nsewerage is enormous, nor does there seem to be any practicable way of\r\nsaving the bulk of it.\r\n\r\nIn many soils the germs which produce nodules are present when clovers\r\nare first grown on them. But where they are not present, the clover\r\nplants have no more power to gather nitrogen than wheat or other\r\nnon-leguminous crops. But since in other soils they are almost entirely\r\nabsent, how shall they be introduced? The process of introducing them is\r\ngenerally referred to as a process of inoculation, and soils when\r\ntreated successfully are said to be inoculated.\r\n\r\nThree methods have been adopted. By the first, as previously indicated,\r\nthe grower perseveres in sowing clover at short intervals in the\r\nrotation. He may also add farmyard manure occasionally, and thus,\r\nthrough the inherent power of multiplication in the bacteria, they\r\nincrease sufficiently to enable the land to grow good crops. By the\r\nsecond method, inoculating is effected through soil which is possessed\r\nof the requisite bacteria; and by the third, it is effected through the\r\naid of a prepared product named nitragin.\r\n\r\nWhen fields are to be inoculated by using soil it is obtained from areas\r\nwhich have grown clovers successfully quite recently, and which are,\r\ntherefore, likely to be well filled with the desired bacteria. In some\r\ninstances the seed is mixed with the soil and these are sown together.\r\nTo thus mix the seed with the soil and then sow both together broadcast\r\nor with a seed drill is usually effective, and it is practicable when\r\nminimum quantities of soil well laden with germs are used. In other\r\ninstances the soil containing germs is scattered broadcast before or\r\nsoon after the seed is sown. Considerable quantities of earth must needs\r\nbe applied by this method.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that each class of legumes has its own proper\r\nbacteria. Because of this, inoculation can only, or at least chiefly, be\r\neffected through the use of soils on which that particular class of\r\nlegumes have grown, or which are possessed of bacteria proper to that\r\nparticular species. In other words, bacteria necessary to the growth of\r\nvetches will not answer for the growth of clovers, and _vice versa_. Nor\r\nwill the bacteria requisite to grow medium red clover answer for growing\r\nalfalfa. In other words, the bacteria proper to the growth of one member\r\nof even a family of plants will not always answer for the growth of\r\nanother member of the same. But in some instances it is thought that it\r\nwill answer. The study of this phase of the question has not yet\r\nprogressed far enough to reflect as much light upon it as could be\r\ndesired. It is certainly known, however, that alfalfa will grow on soils\r\nthat grow burr clover (_Medicago maculata_) and sweet clover (_Melilotus\r\nalba_), hence the inference that soil from fields of either will\r\ninoculate for alfalfa.\r\n\r\nNitragin is the name given by certain German investigators to a\r\ncommercial product put upon the market, which claims to be a pure\r\nculture of the root tubercle organism. These cultures were sold in the\r\nliquid form, and it was customary when using them to treat the seed with\r\nthem before it was planted. Their use has been largely abandoned,\r\nbecause of the few successes which followed their use compared with the\r\nmany failures. But it is now believed that these cultures can be\r\nprepared and used so as to be generally effective and without excessive\r\ncost to the grower.\r\n\r\nIn preparing cultures it has been found that by gradually reducing the\r\namount of nitrogen in the culture of media, it is possible to increase\r\nthe nitrogen fixing power in these germs from five to ten times as much\r\nas usually occurs in nature. It is now known that the bacteria thus\r\ngrown upon nitrogen free media retain high activity if carefully dried\r\nand then revived in liquid media at the end of the varying lengths of\r\ntime. Some absorbent is used to soak up the tubercle-forming organisms.\r\nThe cultures are then allowed to dry, and when in that condition they\r\ncan be safely sent to any part of the country without losing their\r\nefficacy. It is necessary to revive the dry germs by immersing them in\r\nwater. By adding certain nutrient salts the bacteria are greatly\r\nincreased if allowed to stand for a limited time--as short, in some\r\ninstances, as 24 hours. The culture thus sent out in a dry form, and no\r\nlarger than a yeast cake, may thus be made to furnish bacteria\r\nsufficient to inoculate not less than an acre of land. It is stated that\r\nthe amount of inoculating material thus obtained is only limited by the\r\nquantity of the nutrient water solution used in increasing the germs, so\r\nthat the cost of inoculating land by this process is not large. The\r\nculture may be applied by simply soaking the seed in it, by spraying the\r\nsoil, or by first mixing the culture into earth, spreading it over the\r\nfield and then harrowing it. Inoculations thus tried under the\r\nsupervision of the United States Department of Agriculture have proved\r\nquite successful.\r\n\r\nWhere any legume is extensively grown surrounding soils come to be\r\ninoculated through the agency of winds and water. The increase brought\r\nto the yield of plants on various soils runs all the way from a slight\r\ngain to 1000-fold. And when soil is once inoculated it remains so for a\r\nlong time, even though the proper legume should not be grown again on\r\nthe same soil.\r\n\r\nThe amount of nitrogen that may thus be brought to many soils by growing\r\nclover and other legumes upon them is only hedged in practically by the\r\nnature of the rotation fixed upon. An acre of clover when matured will\r\nsometimes add 200 to 300 pounds of nitrogen to the soil under favorable\r\nconditions. Where the soil contains the requisite bacteria, the young\r\nplants begin to form tubercles when but a few weeks old, and continue to\r\ndo so while the plant is active until mature. That the plants use much\r\nof the nitrogen while growing would seem to be clear, from the fact that\r\ntoward the close of the growing season the tubercles become more or less\r\nbroken down and shrunken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMEDIUM RED CLOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nMedium Red Clover (_Trifolium pratense_) is also known by the names\r\nCommon Red Clover, Broad-Leaved Clover and Meadow Trefoil. The term\r\nmedium has doubtless come to be applied to it because the plants are in\r\nsize intermediate between the Mammoth variety (_Trifolium magnum_) and\r\nthe smaller varieties, as the Alsike (_Trifolium hybridum_) and the\r\nsmall white (_Trifolium repens_). But by no designation is it so\r\nfrequently referred to as that of Red Clover.\r\n\r\nThis plant is spreading and upright in its habit of growth. Several\r\nbranches rise up from the crown of each plant, and these in turn\r\nfrequently become branched more or less in their upward growth. The\r\nheads which produce the flowers are nearly globular in shape, inclining\r\nto ovate, and average about one inch in diameter. Each plant contains\r\nseveral heads, and frequently a large number when the growth is not too\r\ncrowded. When in full flower these are of a beautiful purple crimson,\r\nhence, a field of luxuriant red clover is beautiful to look upon. The\r\nstems of the plants are slightly hairy, and ordinarily they stand at\r\nleast fairly erect and reach the height of about one foot or more; but\r\nwhen the growth is rank, they will grow much higher, even as high as 4\r\nfeet in some instances, but when they grow much higher than the average\r\ngiven, the crop usually lodges. The leaves are numerous, and many of\r\nthem have very frequently, if not, indeed, always, a whitish mark in the\r\ncenter, resembling a horseshoe. The tap roots go down deeply into the\r\nsoil. Usually they penetrate the same to about 2 feet, but in some\r\ninstances, as when subsoils are open and well stored with accessible\r\nfood, they go down to the depth of 5 or 6 feet. The tap roots are\r\nnumerously branched, and the branches extend in all directions. When\r\nthey are short, as they must needs be in very stiff subsoils and on thin\r\nland underlaid with hard soil, the branches become about as large as the\r\ntap roots. It has been computed that the weight of the roots in the soil\r\nis about equal to the weight of the stem and leaves.\r\n\r\nMedium red clover is ordinarily biennial in its habit of growth, but\r\nunder some conditions it is perennial. Usually in much of the\r\nMississippi basin it is biennial, especially on prairie soils. On the\r\nclay loam soils of Ontario, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana and some\r\nother States, it is essentially biennial, but many of the plants will\r\nsurvive for a longer period. In the mountain valleys in the Northwestern\r\nStates, and on the Pacific slope west of the Cascade Mountains, it is\r\nperennial. Medium red clover meadows in these have been cut for several\r\nsuccessive years without re-seeding the crop. The duration of this plant\r\nis also more or less influenced by pasturing as compared with cutting\r\nfor seed. Grazing the plants has the effect of prolonging the period of\r\ntheir growth, while maturing seed from them has the opposite effect.\r\n\r\nMedium red clover is characterized by a rapid growth. Seed sown in the\r\nspring has in certain climates produced a crop of hay in 120 days from\r\nthe date of sowing. It is also most persistent in its growth from spring\r\nuntil fall when sufficient moisture is present. In this property it far\r\noutranks any of the other varieties of clover. It comes into bloom in\r\nthe South during the latter half of May and in the North during the\r\nmonth of June, early or later, according to location, and in about sixty\r\ndays from the time that it is cut for hay. Ordinarily, a second cutting\r\nof hay may be taken from it and still later some pasture.\r\n\r\nIt furnishes excellent pasture, soiling food and hay for nearly all\r\nclasses of live stock. While it is much relished by the stock, it is\r\nprobably not exceeded in its capacity for quick and prolonged growth\r\nthroughout the growing season by any pasture plant, except alfalfa. For\r\na similar reason it stands high as a soiling food. No other variety of\r\nclover grown in America will furnish as much of either pasture or\r\nsoiling food. For animals producing milk and for young animals, the\r\npasture is particularly excellent. It is also the standard pasture for\r\nswine where it can be grown, and where alfalfa is not a staple crop.\r\nWhen the hay is well cured, it makes a ration in even balance for cattle\r\nand sheep, and for horses it is equally good. The prejudice which exists\r\nin some quarters against feeding it to horses has arisen, in part, at\r\nleast, from feeding it when improperly harvested, when over-ripe, when\r\ndamaged by rain, or by overcuring in the sun, or when it may have been\r\nstored so green as to induce molding. It may also be fed with much\r\nadvantage to brood sows and other swine in winter.\r\n\r\nAs a soil improver, medium red clover is probably without a rival,\r\nunless it be in mammoth clover, and in one respect it exceeds the\r\nmammoth variety; that is, in the more prolonged season, during which it\r\nmay be plowed under as a green manure. Its quick growth peculiarly\r\nadapts it to soil enrichment. For this reason, it is more sown than any\r\nof the other varieties in the spring of the year, along with the small\r\ncereal grains to be plowed under in the late autumn or in the following\r\nspring, after the clover has made a vigorous start, since it produces\r\ntwo crops in one season, the first crop may be harvested and the second\r\nplowed under after having made a full growth. This can be said of no\r\nother variety of clover. More enrichment is also obtained from the\r\nfalling of the leaves when two crops are grown than from the other\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nThe influence of this plant on weed destruction when grown for hay is\r\ngreater than with the other varieties of clover. This is owing in part\r\nto the shade resulting from its rapid growth and in part to the two\r\ncuttings which are usually made of the crop. These two cuttings prevent\r\nthe maturing of the seeds in nearly all annual weeds, and to a very\r\ngreat extent in all classes of biennials. The power of this crop to\r\nsmother out perennials is also considerable, and when this is linked\r\nwith the weakening caused by the two cuttings, it sometimes proves\r\neffective in completely eradicating for the time being this class of\r\nweeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Medium Red Clover (_Trifolium pratense_)\r\n  Oregon Experiment Station]\r\n\r\n=Distribution.=--Medium red clover is thought to be native to Europe. It\r\nwas probably introduced into England some time early in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. That it was attracting attention about the middle of the\r\ncentury or a little later, is rendered probable by the fact that it is\r\ndiscussed at considerable length in the third edition of Blyth's\r\n\"Improver Improved,\" published in 1662, while it is not mentioned in the\r\nfirst edition, published in 1650. It was doubtless introduced into the\r\nUnited States by the early colonists and at sundry times.\r\n\r\nMedium red clover will grow in good form only in the temperate zone,\r\nsince it cannot stand excessive heat or excessive cold. The northerly\r\nlimit of its successful growth in North America is somewhere about 50 deg.\r\nnorth latitude on the wind-swept prairies, but on suitable soils, and\r\nprotected somewhat by trees and winter snows, it will probably grow 10\r\ndegrees further to the north. In British Columbia, on the Pacific slope,\r\nit will probably grow as far north as Alaska. But on prairies eastward\r\nfrom the Rocky Mountains, it has not been grown with much success much\r\nfurther north than 48 deg., unless under the eastern shadow of the Rocky\r\nMountains. Low temperatures in winter, where there is only a moderate\r\ncovering of snow, are far less fatal to clover plants than exposure to\r\nthe sweep of the cold winds. Even where the thermometer is not so low as\r\nin the areas just referred to, such winds are particularly damaging to\r\nthe plants when they blow fiercely just after a thaw which has removed a\r\nprevious covering of snow. In some instances, one cold wave under the\r\nconditions named has proved fatal to promising crops of clover over\r\nextended areas.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, the southerly limit of vigorous and reliable growth\r\nmay be put at about 37 deg.. But in some localities good crops may be grown\r\nfurther South, especially in some parts of Tennessee. Nor would it be\r\ncorrect to say that medium red clover grows at its best in many\r\nlocalities much south of 38 deg.. On the plateaus it can be grown further\r\nSouth, where the soil is suitable.\r\n\r\nThis plant flourishes best in a moist climate. In fact, the abundance\r\nand continuance of the growth for the season are largely dependent on\r\nthe amount of the precipitation, and on the distribution of the same\r\nthroughout the season. In climates in which it is usual for a long spell\r\nof dry weather to occur in mid-summer, the plants will not make rapid\r\ngrowth after the first cutting of the season; but under conditions the\r\nopposite, they will grow continuously from spring until fall. Continuous\r\ngrowth may be secured through all the season on irrigated land. Although\r\nthe plants root deeply, they will succumb under drought beyond a certain\r\ndegree, and in some soils the end comes much more quickly than on\r\nothers; on porous and sandy soils, it comes much sooner than on clays.\r\nOn the latter, drought must be excessive to destroy clover plants that\r\nhave been well rooted. White clover can withstand much heat when\r\nsupplied with moisture. Moderate temperatures are much more favorable to\r\nits growth.\r\n\r\nSpring weather, characterized by prolonged periods of alternate freezing\r\nand thawing, is disastrous to the plants on dry soils, possessed of an\r\nexcess of moisture, when not covered with snow. They are gradually drawn\r\nup out of the soil and left to die on the surface. In some instances,\r\nthe destruction of an otherwise fine stand is complete. In other\r\ninstances, it is partial, and when it is, a heavy roller run over the\r\nland is helpful in firming the soil around the roots that have been thus\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nMedium red clover can be grown with some success in certain parts of\r\nalmost every State in the Union. But in paying crops it is not much\r\ngrown south of parallel 37 deg.. With irrigation it grows most vigorously in\r\nthe mountain valleys between the Rocky and Cascade mountains, and\r\nbetween about 37 deg. and 50 deg. north latitude. In these valleys its habit of\r\ngrowth is perennial. Without irrigation, the highest adaptation, all\r\nthings considered, is found in Washington and Oregon, west of the\r\nCascades, except where shallow soils lying on gravels exist. East of the\r\nmountains, the best crops are in the States of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana,\r\nKentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The soils\r\nof Northern Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, that have produced\r\nhardwood timber, have unusually high adaptation to the growth of this\r\nplant, and as the snow usually covers the ground in these areas in\r\nwinter, the crop may be relied upon with much certainty. But on the\r\nsandy soils, which more or less abound in these areas, it does not\r\nsucceed so well. It has not yet proved a marked success in Western\r\nMinnesota or in the Dakotas, owing in part probably to the lack of the\r\nproper bacteria in the soil. Its growth in these localities, however, is\r\nextending from year to year. Indiana and Ohio are great clover States,\r\nand the same is true of much of Illinois and Iowa; but southward in\r\nthese States there is some hazard to the young plants from drought and\r\nheat in summer, and to an occasional frost in winter when the ground is\r\nbare.\r\n\r\nEast of the States named, it would probably be correct to say that the\r\nhighest adaptation is found in New York and Pennsylvania, particularly\r\nthe former, in many parts of which excellent crops are grown. In various\r\nparts of the New England States good crops may also be grown. Much of\r\nthe soil in these is not sufficiently fertile to grow clover as it can\r\nbe grown in the more Central States. The same is true of the States of\r\nDelaware, Maryland and Eastern Virginia, east of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nsouth from the Canadian boundary and west from Minnesota, Iowa and\r\nMissouri, but little success has heretofore attended the efforts to grow\r\nmedium red clover. This statement does not apply equally to Eastern\r\nNebraska and Kansas. Usually the climate is not moist enough in summer,\r\nthe sweep of the cold winds is too great in winter, the snowfall is\r\nusually insufficient to protect the plants, and it may be also that the\r\nrequisite bacteria is lacking in the soil. Sometime, however, these\r\nadverse conditions may in part be overcome by man's resourcefulness. In\r\nparts of States that lie south of the 37th parallel, it may be found\r\nprofitable to grow crops of medium red clover; but in these, other\r\nlegumes, as crimson clover, cow peas and soy beans, will probably\r\nfurnish food more reliably and more cheaply.\r\n\r\nIn Canada the highest all-round adaptation for clover is in Ontario and\r\nQuebec, unless it be the mountain valleys and tide lands of British\r\nColumbia. Because of the high adaptation in the soil of the two\r\nprovinces first named, and the plentifulness of the snowfall, clover in\r\nthese is one of the surest of the crops grown. The maritime provinces of\r\nNew Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward's Island, particularly the\r\nformer, have soils a little too hungry to produce the highest returns in\r\nclover. On the open prairies between Ontario and the Rocky Mountains,\r\nnot much success has attended the attempts to grow any kind of clover,\r\nowing probably to present uncongeniality in soils and more especially in\r\nclimatic conditions. However, there are good reasons for believing that\r\nwith the introduction of hardy varieties and through the use of Northern\r\ngrown seed, an inoculated soil, where inoculation may be necessary, that\r\nmedium red clover will yet be grown over wide areas in all the provinces\r\nof Northwestern Canada, south of and including the Saskatchewan valley.\r\n\r\n=Soils.=--Fortunately, this most useful plant will grow in a\r\nconsiderable variety of soils, though, of course, not equally well.\r\nHighest in general suitability, probably, are clay loams underlaid with\r\na moderately porous clay subsoil. They should at the same time be moist\r\nand reasonably well stored with humus. On such a soil, in a climate with\r\nsufficient rainfall and properly distributed, a stand of clover should\r\nbe looked upon as reasonably certain any season when properly sown. It\r\nwould also be correct to say that on the volcanic soils of the mountain\r\nStates in the West, clover will grow equally well when supplied with\r\nmoisture, and in these it is also very tenacious of life.\r\n\r\nNext in adaptation are what may be termed loam soils, also underlaid\r\nwith clay. The proportion of the clay in them will exercise an important\r\ninfluence on the growth of the clover. Loamy sands will grow clover\r\nbetter than sandy loams, although both are very suitable, the other\r\nconditions being right.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to be correct to assign third place to stiff clays,\r\nwhether of the white or red cast. The better that these are supplied\r\nwith vegetable matter, and the more moist the season, the better is the\r\nstand of the clover likely to be. In seasons that are generally\r\nfavorable, excellent crops of clover may be obtained from such soils,\r\nbut in dry seasons it is easy to secure a good stand of the plants. They\r\nare also considerably liable to heave in these soils in the spring of\r\nthe year from the action of the frost. The more perfectly they are\r\ndrained, the less will be the injury from this source, but it is\r\nscarcely possible to drain such lands so perfectly that there will be no\r\nloss of clover plants in these from the source named in the winters,\r\ncharacterized by frequent rains, accompanied by frequent alternations of\r\nfreezing and thawing. The loss from this source in such lands varies\r\nfrom nothing at all to 100 per cent.\r\n\r\nNearly, if not equal to the former, are dark loam soils with a gravel or\r\nsand drainage underneath, providing, first, that the sand and gravel do\r\nnot come too near the surface, and second, that the normal rainfall is\r\nsufficient. On such soils it seldom fails to grow, is not liable to\r\nheave in the winter or spring, and usually produces excellent crops when\r\nthese soils are properly tilled. It has special adaptation for being\r\ngrown on calcareous or limy soils. It also, usually, grows well on soils\r\nunderlaid with yellow clay of more or less tenacity.\r\n\r\nThe black humus soils of the prairie vary much in their suitability for\r\ngrowing medium red clover. Much depends on the clay content in such\r\nsoils. The more of this element in them and the nearer an underlying\r\nclay subsoil is to the surface, the better will this clover grow on\r\nthem. In large areas of the prairie, red clover will grow more\r\nsuccessfully on the subsoil when laid bare than when on the surface\r\nsoil. It has been the experience in many instances that when the humus\r\nsoils of the prairie, porous and spongy in character, were first tilled,\r\nclover grew on them so shyly that it was difficult to get a good stand\r\nof the same until it had been sown for several seasons successively or\r\nat intervals. Eventually, good crops were grown on these lands, and are\r\nnow being grown on them. This was the experience that faced a majority\r\nof the first settlers on the prairie where excellent crops are now being\r\ngrown, and it is the experience which faces many to-day, who are\r\nlocated on sections of the prairie but newly broken.\r\n\r\nTwo reasons may be given by way of explanation, but these may not\r\nfurnish all the reasons for the experience just referred to. First, much\r\nof the land was so porous in its nature that in dry seasons the young\r\nplants perished for want of moisture. As such lands become worn through\r\ncropping, they lie more firmly and compactly; hence, there is less loss\r\nof moisture through the free penetration of the soil within a short\r\ndistance of the surface of the dry atmosphere. And second, the requisite\r\nbacteria is not in these soils until it is brought to them by sowing\r\nseed repeatedly, more or less of which grows, and in growing increases\r\nthe bacteria in the soil until that point is reached when good crops of\r\nclover can be grown with the usual regularity.\r\n\r\nThe suitability of sandy and gravelly lands for growing clover depends\r\nmuch on the amount of plant food which they contain, on the character of\r\nthe climate, and on the subsoil. Such soils when possessed of some loam\r\nwhen underlaid with clay, and in a climate with 20 inches and more per\r\nannum of rainfall, usually grow good crops of clover; but when\r\nconditions the opposite prevail, the growth of this plant is precarious.\r\nHowever, when sandy or gravelly soils low in fertility are underlaid\r\nwith the same and the rainfall is sufficient, good crops of clover may\r\nbe grown if these soils are first sufficiently supplied with vegetable\r\nmatter and then sufficiently fertilized.\r\n\r\nMuck soils do not seem to have the proper elements for growing clover in\r\nthe best form. But when these have in them some clay, and especially\r\nwhen they are underlaid with clay not distant from the surface, they\r\nwill grow good crops of clover, especially of the alsike variety. Thus\r\nit is that lands which have grown black ash and tamarack generally make\r\ngood clover lands also. But clover will not succeed well on unreduced\r\npeaty soils, since it is not able in these to gather food supplies. But\r\nwhen sufficiently reduced, some kinds of clover will succeed better on\r\nthese than on some other soils.\r\n\r\nDeposit soils, such as are found in the bottom lands of rivers and\r\nstreams, vary much in the suitability for growing clover, owing to the\r\ngreat differences in the compositions; but since they are usually\r\npossessed of sufficient friability, fertility and moisture, good crops\r\nof clover may generally be grown upon them where the climatic conditions\r\nare suitable. The injury from overflow on such soils will depend on the\r\ndepth of the same and its duration, also the season of the year when it\r\noccurs. Overflow in the spring season before growth has begun, or when\r\nit is about starting, will be helpful rather than harmful, especially if\r\nsome deposit is left on the land by the subsiding waters. But if the\r\noverflow should be deep and of any considerable duration, and, moreover,\r\nif it should occur when the clover was somewhat advanced in growth, and\r\nin hot weather, the submergence of the clover would probably be fatal to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to state here that the lands which grow hardwood timber\r\nwill usually grow clover. By hardwood timber is meant such trees as\r\nmaple, beech, birch, oak, elm, basswood, butternut and walnut. Where\r\nforests are found comprising one or more varieties of these trees\r\nanywhere on this continent, and especially comprising several of them,\r\nthe conclusion is safe that medium red clover will grow, or, at least,\r\ncan be grown, on such soils. If a considerable sprinkling of pine trees\r\nis found in the same, the indications are not changed in consequence.\r\nWhere the forest is largely composed of maple and birch, excellent crops\r\nof clover may be looked for when the land has been cleared. But because\r\nof what has been said, the conclusion must not be reached that clover\r\nwill not grow well under some conditions where soft woods abound, but\r\nrather that where the former abound the indications of suitability for\r\nclover production are more certain than where soft timbers abound.\r\n\r\n=Place in the Rotation.=--Medium red clover may be made to precede or to\r\nfollow almost any crop that is grown upon the farm. Notwithstanding,\r\nthere are certain crops which it precedes or follows with much more\r\nadvantage than others. Since it brings nitrogen to the soil from the air\r\nand deposits the same for the benefit of the crops that immediately\r\nfollow, it is advantageous to plant such crops after it as require much\r\nnitrogen to make them productive, as, for instance, wheat. Since,\r\nthrough the medium of its roots, it stores the ground with humus, such\r\ncrops should come after it as feed generously on humus, as, for\r\ninstance, corn and potatoes. And since it tends to lessen weed growth\r\nthrough smothering, it may with advantage be followed by crops for which\r\na clean seed bed is specially advantageous, as flax. It may, therefore,\r\nbe followed with much advantage by wheat, oats or barley, corn and\r\nsorghum in all their varieties, flax, potatoes, field roots, vegetables\r\nand such small fruits as strawberries. Where wheat is a success it is\r\nusually first grown among the small cereal grains after clover, since it\r\nis less able to flourish under the conditions which become decreasingly\r\nfavorable in the years that follow the breaking up of the clover.\r\nWhether wheat or flax, corn or potatoes should immediately follow the\r\ngrowing of clover, should be determined in great part by the immediate\r\nnecessity for growing one or the other of these crops, but also to some\r\nextent by the crops that are to follow them.\r\n\r\nClover may follow such crops as require cultivation while they are\r\ngrowing, and of a character that will clean the soil. This means that it\r\nmay with advantage be made to follow corn, sorghum, potatoes or field\r\nroots. It may also follow the summer fallow bare, or producing crops for\r\nbeing plowed under where these come into the rotation. Of course, since\r\nclover can to a considerable extent supply its own nitrogen, it may be\r\nsuccessfully grown on lands that are not clean, and that may not possess\r\nhigh fertility, but when thus sown the nurse crop with which it is\r\nusually sown is not likely to succeed well, because of the presence of\r\nweeds in it, and from the same cause the quality of the first of the\r\nclover is likely to be much impaired. The conditions of the time of\r\nsowing are also less favorable for getting a stand of the seed.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no rotation in which clover may be grown with more\r\nadvantage than when it is made to alternate with corn or potatoes and\r\nsome small cereal grains, as wheat or oats, growing each crop for but\r\none season. Of course the clover must be sown with the grain and\r\nharvested the following year, taking from it two cuttings. In no other\r\nform of rotation, perhaps, can clover be used to better advantage, nor\r\nwould there seem to be any other way in which land may be made to\r\nproduce abundantly for so large a term of years without fertilization\r\nother than that given to the soil by the clover. It would fully supply\r\nthe needs of the crops alternating with it in the line of humus, and\r\nalso in that of nitrogen. In time the supply of phosphoric acid and\r\npotash might run low, but not for a long term of years. The cultivation\r\ngiven to the corn and potatoes would keep the land clean. Fortunate is\r\nthe neighborhood in which a rotation may be practised, and fortunate are\r\nthe tillers of the soil who are in a position to adopt it.\r\n\r\nMedium red clover may be followed with much advantage by certain catch\r\ncrops sown at various times through the season of growth. It may be\r\npastured in the spring for several weeks, and the land then plowed and\r\nsowed with millet or rape, or planted with corn, sorghum, late potatoes,\r\nor certain vegetables, or it may be allowed to grow for several weeks\r\nand then plowed, to be followed by one or the other of these crops. It\r\nmay also be harvested for hay in time to follow it with millet or rape\r\nfor pasture, and under some conditions with fodder corn. But when the\r\nstand of clover is good, it would usually be profitable to utilize the\r\nclover for food rather than the crops mentioned, since doing so would\r\ninvolve but little labor and outlay. After the second cutting for the\r\nseason, winter rye may be grown as a catch crop by growing it as a\r\npasture crop.\r\n\r\n=Preparing the Soil.=--Speaking in a general way, it would be correct to\r\nsay that it would not be easy to get soil in too friable a condition for\r\nthe advantageous reception of medium red clover seed. In other words, it\r\ndoes not often happen that soils are in too fine tilth to sow seed upon\r\nthem without such fineness resulting in positive benefit to the plants.\r\nThe exceptions would be clays of fine texture in climates subject to\r\nrainfalls so heavy as to produce impaction. On the other hand, the\r\nhazard would be even greater to sow clover on these soils when in a\r\ncloddy condition. The rootlets would not then be able to penetrate the\r\nsoil with sufficient ease to find enough food and moisture to properly\r\nnourish them. Some soils are naturally friable, and in these a tilth\r\nsufficiently fine can be realized ordinarily with but little labor.\r\nOther soils, as stiff clays, frequently require much labor to bring them\r\ninto the condition required. Usually, however, if sufficient time\r\nelapses between the plowing of the land and the sowing of the seed, this\r\nwork may be materially lessened by using the harrow and roller\r\njudiciously soon after rainfall.\r\n\r\nWhen preparing prairie soils so open that they will lift with the wind,\r\nthe aim should be to firm them rather than to render them more open and\r\nporous; otherwise they will not retain sufficient moisture to properly\r\nsustain the young plants, if prolonged dry weather follows the sowing of\r\nthe seed. Plowing such land in the autumn aids in securing such density.\r\nThe same result follows summerfallowing the land or growing upon it a\r\ncultivated crop after the bare fallow, or after the cultivated crop has\r\nbeen harvested prior to the sowing of the clover seed, otherwise the\r\ndesired firmness of the land will be lessened, and weed seeds will be\r\nbrought to the surface, which will produce plants to the detriment of\r\nthe clover. In preparing such lands for the seed, cultivation near the\r\nsurface is preferable to plowing.\r\n\r\nWhen the clover is sown late in the season, as is sometimes the case, in\r\nlocations where the winters are comparatively mild, the ground may be\r\nmade reasonably clean before the seed is sown, by stirring it\r\noccasionally at intervals before sowing the seed. This is done with some\r\nform of harrow or weeder, and, of course, subsequently to the plowing of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n=Sowing.=--The time for sowing clover seed is influenced considerably by\r\nthe climatic conditions. Under some conditions it may be sown in the\r\nearly autumn. It may be thus sown in the Southern States and with much\r\nlikelihood that a stand will be secured, yet in some instances an\r\ninauspicious winter proves disastrous to the plants: all things\r\nconsidered, it is probably safer to sow clover in the South at that\r\nseason than the spring, when vegetation is beginning to start. It may\r\nalso succeed in some instances in areas well to the North when sown in\r\nthe early autumn, providing snow covers the ground all the winter, but\r\nshould the snow fail to come the subsequent winter, or fail to lie when\r\nit does come, the clover plants would perish. The element of hazard,\r\ntherefore, is too great in northerly areas to justify sowing the seed\r\nthus. But on the bench lands of the mountain valleys there may be\r\ninstances in which the seed may be sown so late in the autumn that it\r\nwill not sprout before winter sets in, but lies in the soil ready to\r\nutilize the moisture, so all important in those areas, as soon as the\r\nearliest growth begins in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be sown with no little assurance of success in the late\r\nsummer. But this can only be done where moisture is reasonably plentiful\r\nfrom the time of sowing onward, and where the winters are not really\r\nsevere. In some of the Central States this method of sowing may succeed\r\nreasonably well. Clover and timothy sown thus without any nurse crop\r\nwill produce a full crop the next season. When the seed is sown thus, it\r\nmay, of course, be made to follow a crop grown on the land the same\r\nseason. It may also insure a crop the following season, when the clover\r\nseed sown the spring previously may for some reason have failed.\r\n\r\nWhile medium red clover is frequently sown in the South and in some\r\nareas of the far West in the months of January and February on the snow,\r\nin the North it is usually sown in the early spring. This also is in a\r\ngreat majority of instances the best time for sowing. In many locations\r\nit may be sown with safety as soon as the winter snows have gone. On the\r\nwhole, the earlier that it is sown in the spring the better, that the\r\nyoung plants may have all the benefit possible from the moisture, which\r\nis more abundant than later. But there are certain areas, as, for\r\ninstance, in the northerly limits of the Mississippi basin, in which\r\nyoung clover plants perish by frost after they have germinated. This,\r\nhowever, does not happen very frequently. When the seed is sown on the\r\nsnow, or while the ground is yet in a honeycombed condition from early\r\nfrost, it must of necessity be sown early. But where the hazard is\r\npresent that the young plants will be killed by frost, it will be safer\r\nto defer sowing the seed until it can be covered with the harrow when\r\nsown.\r\n\r\nWhether it will be more advisable to sow the seed on bare ground earlier\r\nthan the season when growth begins, or to sow later and cover with the\r\nharrow, will depend to a considerable degree upon the soil and the\r\ncondition in which it happens to be. On timber soils newly cleaned the\r\nearly sowing would be quite safe where the young plants are not liable\r\nto be killed after germination, because of the abundance of humus in\r\nthem. On the same soils, early sowing would probably be preferable, even\r\nwhen much reduced in humus, providing they were in a honeycombed\r\ncondition at the time of sowing. This condition is far more\r\ncharacteristic of clay and clay loam soils, than of those sandy in\r\ntexture. To sow the seed on clay soils that are worn would be to throw\r\nit away, unless in a most favorable season for growth. The same would\r\nprove true of the sandy soils low in humus, since these do not honeycomb\r\nat any season. Seed sown on honeycombed ground falls into openings made\r\nin the soil, and is covered by the action of the frost and the sun on\r\nthe same. The rule should be to defer sowing the seed where the ground\r\ndoes not honeycomb until it can be covered with the harrow.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the seed is sown successfully just after a light fall\r\nof snow in the spring. The seed is carried down into little crevices or\r\nfissures in the soil when these are present, but the seed should not be\r\nthus sown. Usually it is not quite safe to sow clover seed where the\r\nwinter snow still lingers to any considerable depth, lest much of it\r\nshould be carried down to the lower lands by the sudden melting of the\r\nsnows. The chief advantage of sowing before the ground can be harrowed\r\narises from the benefit which the young plants derive from the plentiful\r\nsupply of moisture in the soil at that season. They are more firmly\r\nrooted than plants sown later, and, therefore, can better withstand the\r\ndry weather that frequently characterizes the later months of the\r\nsummer. There is also the further advantage that the labor of harrowing\r\nat a season that is usually a busy one is dispensed with.\r\n\r\nVarious modes of sowing clover seed have been adopted. Sometimes it is\r\nsown by hand. In other instances a sower is used which is strapped to\r\nthe shoulder and turned with a crank. Sometimes the seed is sown by a\r\ndistributor, which is wheeled over the ground on a frame resembling that\r\nof a wheelbarrow. Again, it is sown with a seeder attachment to the\r\nordinary grain drill or to the broadcast seeder, and yet again with the\r\ngrain in the ordinary drill tubes, or scattered with the same by the\r\nbroadcast seeder; which of these methods should be adopted will depend\r\non such conditions as relate to season, climate and soil.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be sown by hand at almost any time desired, whether it is\r\ncovered or not. The advantages of hand sowing are that it may be done\r\nunder some conditions when no other method will answer as well, as, for\r\ninstance, when it is sown upon snow or upon the ground honeycombed. The\r\ndisadvantages are that it takes more time than some of the other\r\nmethods, especially when the sower only scatters the seed with one hand,\r\nthat it cannot be thus sown when the wind blows stiffly or fitfully, and\r\nmost of all, only a limited number of persons who sow seed are thus able\r\nto sow it with complete regularity. A still time should, if possible, be\r\nchosen for hand sowing; such a time is usually found in the early\r\nmorning. When one hand is used, the seed may be sown from a light dish\r\nor pail or sowing-bag, but when both hands are used a sowing-box or a\r\nsowing-sack suspended in front of the breast is necessary. Clover seed\r\nmay be sown when a considerable breeze is blowing by having a due regard\r\nto the wind. When facing it, the cast of seed should be low; when going\r\nbefore the wind it should be high. But when the wind is blowing at\r\nright angles, much care must be observed by the sower as to where he\r\nwalks, in relation to the cast that is being sown.\r\n\r\nWhen the seed is sown on grain that has been drilled, the rows of grain\r\nwill suffice to serve as a guide to the sower, and when the grain is not\r\nup, the drill marks may be made to serve the same end.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the hand seeder held in place by straps are that the\r\nsowing may be done by an individual who cannot sow by hand, that the\r\nseed may be easily distributed and that it may be used with advantage in\r\nsowing seed among brush. The disadvantages are that it cannot be used\r\nwhen much wind is stirring, and when using it stakes are sometimes\r\nnecessary for the guidance of the sower.\r\n\r\nThe advantages from using the seeder wheeled over the ground are that\r\nthe work may be done by any one able to wheel the seeder, that the seed\r\nis distributed evenly, that it may be sown when a fairly stiff wind is\r\nblowing, and that stakes are not necessary for the guidance of the\r\nsower, as the distance of the cast may be gauged at least fairly well by\r\nthe wheel marks made. One disadvantage is that it cannot be used with\r\nmuch satisfaction on certain soils when the ground is cloddy or frozen,\r\nor when it is wet. There is also the disadvantage to all three methods\r\nof sowing by hand, that it is frequently necessary to provide a covering\r\nfor the seed by subsequently using the harrow.\r\n\r\nThe advantages from sowing with the seeder attachment to the grain drill\r\nare that the seed may be made to fall before or behind the tubes as may\r\nbe desired, or it may be sown with the seed along with the grain, and\r\nthat when sown by any of these methods there is much saving of time as\r\ncompared with sowing by hand. In some sections of the prairie the seed\r\nis sown with the grain drill by driving the same across the newly sown\r\ngrain rows. If necessary to insure sufficiently thin sowing, the seed\r\nshould be first mixed with some substance such as common salt.\r\n\r\nIn the moist areas of the upper Atlantic coast, Ontario and the Puget\r\nSound region, the seed is frequently made to fall behind the grain tubes\r\non clay and clay loam soils, and is covered by running the roller over\r\nthe ground subsequently; but in States more inland the seed is usually\r\nmade to fall before the drill tubes, when, in some instances, the sowing\r\nof the grain will provide a sufficient covering; but in others the\r\nharrow is used in addition, and sometimes both the harrow and the\r\nroller. When clover seed is sown along with grain and by the same tubes,\r\nit will in some soils be buried too deeply, but in others the objection\r\ndoes not hold good. The young plants are also injured more by shade from\r\nthe grain, since they grow only in the line of the row along with the\r\ngrain, and yet this method of sowing clover seed in some localities\r\nseems to answer reasonably well.\r\n\r\nWhen the broadcast seeder is used in sowing clover seed, time is also\r\nsaved as compared with hand sowing, but the seed can only fall before\r\nthe seeder, and must, therefore, be given the same covering as the\r\ngrain, as, when the seed is sown with the grain drill, it will in some\r\ninstances be buried too deeply. In other instances it is not so.\r\n\r\nThe depth to which the seed of medium and other clovers ought to be\r\nburied should vary with soil and climatic conditions, and with the\r\nseason of sowing. The more stiff the soil, the more moist the climate,\r\nand the earlier that the seed is sown, the less the covering required,\r\nand _vice versa_. As has been shown, under certain conditions (see page\r\n22), early sown clover seed does not require any covering artificially\r\ngiven, and sometimes when sown later, a reasonably copious rain will\r\nprovide sufficient covering, providing it falls quite soon after the\r\nsowing of the seed. But in certain of the soft, open, spongy soils of\r\nthe prairie, it may sometimes be buried to the depth of at least 3\r\ninches, with apparent benefit. Lower than 5 or 6 inches in any soil,\r\nclover seed will not germinate till brought nearer the surface. On all\r\nsoils that lift with the wind, the seed should, as a rule, be buried\r\ndeeply. Ordinarily, from half an inch to an inch, or an approximation to\r\nthese distances, is considered a proper depth to bury clover seed.\r\n\r\nSome authorities recommend sowing medium and other clovers without any\r\nnurse crop. The advantages claimed are that more or less of a crop may\r\nbe obtained the same season, and that a stand of clover is more certain\r\nwhen the seed is sown thus. The first claim is correct in the main. In\r\nsome localities favored with long seasons for growth, as in certain\r\nareas of Missouri, for instance, good yields may be obtained from sowing\r\nthe seed thus. This has happened even in Minnesota. But in other areas\r\nand under other conditions, the yield would be light. In some\r\nlocalities, as, for instance, the Willamette Valley, Oregon,\r\nsatisfactory returns have been obtained by sowing clover seed and rape\r\nseed in May and then pasturing both.\r\n\r\nThe chief objections to sowing clover seed thus are, first, that in a\r\ngreat majority of instances a sufficient stand of the plants may be\r\nobtained when the seed is sown with a nurse crop; and second, that when\r\nit is not thus sown, the first cutting of the hay will contain more or\r\nless of weeds. That a stand is more assured when clover seed is sown\r\nalone in areas where adverse weather conditions prevail cannot be\r\ndisputed. Nevertheless, the fact remains that whenever in order to get a\r\nstand of a short-lived crop, like clover, it is necessary to sow it\r\nalone, and in many instances get but little return the same season, it\r\nwill be well to consider if there is not some more satisfactory way of\r\nsecuring a crop that will prove an equivalent. In northerly areas the\r\nstubbles of the nurse crop frequently render substantial service to the\r\nclover by holding the snow on the crop, and also by protecting it more\r\nor less from the effect of the cold winds. The old-time practice of\r\nsowing clover with a nurse crop is likely to be continued,\r\nnotwithstanding that it has some disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThese disadvantages include the following: 1. The young plants are\r\nliable to be weakened by the crowding and by overmuch shading from the\r\ngrain when it grows rankly and thickly, and to such an extent that they\r\nperish; 2. When the grain lodges, as it frequently does, on rich\r\nground, the clover plants underneath the lodged portions succumb from\r\nwant of light; 3. Where the supply of moisture is low, in the struggle\r\nfor the same between the stronger plants of the nurse crop and the\r\nweaker plants of the clover, the former secures the larger share. As a\r\nresult, when the nurse crop is harvested, should the weather prove hot\r\nand dry beyond a certain degree, the clover plants will die. This is an\r\nexperience not at all uncommon on the loose prairie soils of the upper\r\nMississippi basin.\r\n\r\nInjury from crowding and overshading may be prevented, or at least\r\nlessened, by pasturing the nurse crop with sheep for a time, at an early\r\nstage in its growth. The lodging of the grain may also be prevented by\r\nthe same means. Injury from drought may also be lessened by cutting the\r\ncrop at the proper stage of advancement, and making it into hay, as in\r\nthe ripening stage of growth it draws most heavily on the moisture in\r\nthe soil. The oat crop is the most suitable for being thus dealt with.\r\n\r\nClover seed may be sown with any of the small cereal grains as a nurse\r\ncrop, but not with equal advantage. Rye, barley, wheat and oats are\r\nprobably suitable in the order named. Rye shades less than wheat and\r\noats and is harvested early; hence, its suitability for a nurse crop.\r\nWinter rye and winter wheat are more suitable than spring varieties of\r\nthe same, since, on these the crop may usually be sown earlier, and the\r\nsoil is likely to lose less moisture from surface evaporation. The\r\nmarked suitability of barley as a nurse crop arises chiefly from the\r\nshort period which it occupies the ground. Nor is the shade so dense as\r\nfrom grains that grow taller. Oats are the least suitable of all the\r\ncrops named as a nurse crop, since they are characterized by a dense\r\ngrowth of leaves, which shut out the sunlight too much when the growth\r\nis rank. Notwithstanding, the oat crop may well serve such an end when\r\nsown thinly and cut for hay. Mixed grains grown together, as, for\r\ninstance, wheat and oats, or a mixture of the three, answer quite as\r\nwell for a nurse crop as clover and oats. The objection to them for such\r\nuse arises from the fact that they are frequently sown more thickly than\r\ngrain sown alone.\r\n\r\nClover may also be sown with flax or millet or mixed grains grown to\r\nprovide soiling food. When the weather is moist, it is likely to succeed\r\nwell with flax, as the latter does not form so dense a shade when it is\r\ngrowing as some other crops. But flax is usually sown so much later than\r\nthese crops, that in some climates the dry weather following injures and\r\nin some instances destroys the young plants. The dense shade furnished\r\nby millet is also detrimental to the clover plants; nevertheless, owing\r\nto the short period which the former occupies the ground, under\r\nfavorable conditions a stand of clover may be secured. But since millet\r\nis sown later than flax, it frequently happens that there is not\r\nsufficient moisture in the soil to sustain both crops. Mixed grains sown\r\nas soiling food are usually sown reasonably early, and as they are cut\r\nbefore maturity, the danger is so far lessened that the young plants\r\nwill perish from want of moisture, but since these crops are usually\r\ngrown thickly and on rich land, owing to the dense character of the\r\ngrowth, the plants are much more likely to be injured by the dense shade\r\nthus provided.\r\n\r\nClover seed may also be sown with corn and certain other crops that are\r\nusually grazed down, as rape and mixed grains. When sown with corn, the\r\nseed is usually scattered over the ground just before the last\r\ncultivation given to the corn. Attention is now being given to the\r\nintroduction of cultivators which scatter such seeds as clover and rape\r\nin front of them, and so preclude the necessity for hand sowing. From\r\nCentral Ohio southward, this method of securing a stand of clover will\r\nsucceed in corn-growing areas, the other conditions being right. North\r\nfrom the areas named, the young clover plants may be winter killed when\r\nthe seed is sown thus. The less dense the shade furnished by the corn,\r\nand the less dry the weather subsequently to sowing the seed, the better\r\nwill be the stand of the plants secured.\r\n\r\nWhen sown with rape that has been broadcast, clover usually makes a good\r\nstand, providing the rape crop is not sown too late in the season. When\r\nthe rape is grazed down, the grazing does not appear to materially\r\ninjure the clover, and when the shade has been removed by such grazing,\r\nthe clover plants may be expected to make a vigorous growth on such\r\nland. In northerly areas, clover seed may be sown along with rape seed\r\nas late as the end of May. If sown later than that time, the season may\r\nprove too short subsequently to the grazing of the rape to allow the\r\nplants to gather sufficient strength to carry them safely through\r\nnorthern winters. When clover seed is sown with rape, the seeds may be\r\nmixed and sown together.\r\n\r\nClover seed in several of the varieties may be successfully sown on\r\ncertain grain crops grown to provide grazing, especially when these are\r\nsown early. Such pastures may consist of any one of the small cereal\r\ngrains, or more than one, or of all of them.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be sown in these the same as with any crop sown to furnish\r\ngrain. A stand of clover may thus be secured under some conditions in\r\nwhich the clover would perish if sown along with the grain to be\r\nharvested; under other conditions it would not succeed so well. The\r\nformer include soils so open as to readily lose moisture by surface\r\nevaporation. The tramping of the animals on these increases their power\r\nto hold moisture, the grazing down of the grain lessens its demands upon\r\nthe same, thus leaving more for the clover plants, and they are further\r\nstrengthened by the freer access of sunlight. The latter include firm,\r\nstiff clays in rainy climates. To pasture these when thus sown, if moist\r\nbeyond a certain degree, would result in so impacting them that the\r\nyield of the pasture would be greatly decreased in consequence.\r\n\r\nMedium red clover is quite frequently sown alone; that is, without\r\nadmixture with clovers or grasses. It is always sown thus when it is to\r\nbe plowed under, as green manure. It is also usually sown alone in\r\nrotations where it is to be cropped or grazed for one year. But when\r\ngrown for meadow, which is to remain longer than one season, it is\r\ncommonly sown along with timothy. The first year after sowing, the crop\r\nis chiefly clover, and subsequently it is chiefly timothy. Orchard grass\r\nor tall oat grass, or both, may also be sown along with medium red\r\nclover, since these are ready for being cut at the same time as the\r\nclover.\r\n\r\nWhen medium red clover is sown to provide pasture for periods of limited\r\nduration, it is frequently sown along with alsike clover and timothy.\r\nSometimes a moderate amount of alfalfa seed is added. But in arable\r\nsoils in the semi-arid West, these will provide pastures for many years\r\nin succession, if supplied with moisture. The same is true of much of\r\nthe land west of the Cascades, and without irrigation. East from the\r\nMississippi and for some distance west from it, much of the medium red\r\nclover will disappear after being grazed for one season, but the alsike,\r\ntimothy and alfalfa will endure for a longer period.\r\n\r\nIn permanent pastures, whether few or many varieties of seed are sown,\r\nmedium red clover is usually included in the mixture. It is sown because\r\nof the amount of the grazing which it furnishes the season after sowing,\r\nand with the expectation that it will virtually entirely disappear in\r\nthe pastures in two or three seasons after it has been sown.\r\n\r\nWhen medium red clover is sown for being plowed under as green manure,\r\nit is always sown with a nurse crop. Some farmers, in localities well\r\nadapted to the growth of clover, sow more or less of the medium red\r\nvariety on all, or nearly all, of the land devoted to the growth of such\r\ncereals as rye, wheat, barley and oats, when the land is to be plowed\r\nthe autumn or spring following. Reduced quantities of seed are used.\r\nThey believe that the benefit from the young clover plants to the land\r\nwill more than pay for the cost of the seed and the sowing of the same.\r\n\r\nThe amount of seed to sow will depend on the degree of suitability in\r\nthe conditions for growing medium red clover. The more favorable these\r\nare, the less the necessity for using maximum quantities of seed, and\r\n_vice versa_. More seed is required when the clover is not grown with\r\nother grasses or clovers than when it is grown with these. When grown\r\nwithout admixture, 16 pounds of seed per acre may be named as the\r\nmaximum quantity to sow and 8 pounds as the minimum, with 12 pounds as\r\nan average. With all the conditions quite favorable, 10 pounds should\r\nsuffice. In New England and some of the Atlantic States, many growers\r\nsow much more seed than the quantities named, and it may be that the\r\nnecessities of the land call for more. In Great Britain also,\r\nconsiderably larger quantities are sown.\r\n\r\nWhen sown in grass or clover mixtures, the amount of the seed required\r\nwill vary with the other factors of the mixture, and the amount of each\r\nthat is sown; that is, with the character of the hay or pasture that is\r\nsought. The seed is much more frequently sown with timothy than with any\r\nother kind of grass, and the average amount of each of these to sow per\r\nacre may be put at 8 pounds of clover and 6 pounds of timothy. When\r\nother clovers are added, as the mammoth or the alsike, for every pound\r\nof the seed of the former added, the seed of the medium red may be\r\nreduced by one pound, and for every pound of the alsike added it may be\r\nreduced by 1-1/2 pounds. In mixtures for permanent pastures, 6 pounds\r\nmay be fixed upon as the maximum quantity of medium red clover seed to\r\nsow, and 3 pounds as the average quantity. When sown to provide green\r\nmanure, maximum quantities of seed are used when it is desired to\r\nimprove the soil quickly. Usually not less than 12 pounds per acre are\r\nsown, and quite frequently more. But when the gradual improvement of the\r\nland is sought, by sowing the seed on all land devoted to the small\r\ncereal grains, not more than 6 pounds per acre are used, and frequently\r\neven less than 4 pounds. The greater the hazard to the plants in sowing\r\nthe seed thus, the less the quantities of the seed that are usually\r\nsown, with a view to reduce the loss in case of failure to secure a\r\nstand of the clover.\r\n\r\nA stand of medium red clover is sometimes secured by what may be termed\r\nself-sowing. For instance, where clover has been cut for hay and then\r\nallowed to mature even but a portion of the seed before being plowed\r\nunder the same autumn, the seed thus buried remains in the ground\r\nwithout sprouting. When the land is again plowed to the same depth and\r\nsown with some kind of grain, the clover seed thus brought to the\r\nsurface will germinate. If the plowing last referred to is done in the\r\nautumn, it ought to be done late rather than early, lest the seed\r\nshould sprout in the autumn and perish in the winter, or be destroyed by\r\nthe cultivation given in sowing the grain crop that follows. The same\r\nresult may be obtained from clover pastured after the first cutting for\r\nthe season, when the pasturing is not close.\r\n\r\nWhen medium red clover is much grown for seed, many of the ripe heads\r\nare not cut by the mower, since they lie near the ground, and many break\r\noff in the curing process. The seed thus becomes so distributed in the\r\nground, that many plants come up and grow amid the grain every season.\r\nThese may, of course, be grazed or plowed under for the enrichment of\r\nthe land, as desired. Seed thus buried is, therefore, not lost by any\r\nmeans. The plants which grow will render much assistance in keeping the\r\nland in a good condition of tilth, as well as in enhancing its\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nWhen clover seed is much grown, therefore, on any piece of land, the\r\nquantity of seed sown may be reduced materially. In fact, it may be so\r\nmuch reduced that it has been found possible to grow clover in rotation\r\nfor many years without adding seed. The first growth of the clover was\r\ntaken as hay, and the second growth as seed. The ground was then plowed\r\nand a crop of corn was taken. The corn land was then plowed and sown\r\nwith some cereal, such as wheat, oats or barley.\r\n\r\n=Pasturing.=--Medium red clover will furnish grazing very suitable for\r\nany kind of live stock kept upon the farm. All farm animals relish it,\r\nbut not so highly as blue grass, when the latter is tender and\r\nsucculent. No plant is equally suitable in providing pasture for swine,\r\nunless it be alfalfa; hence, for that class of stock, it has come to be\r\nthe staple pasture outside of areas where alfalfa may be readily grown.\r\nWhen desired, the grazing may begin even at a reasonably early stage in\r\nthe growth of the plants, and it may continue to the end of the\r\npasturing season.\r\n\r\nUsually it is considered unwise to pasture medium red clover the same\r\nseason in which it has been sown when sown with a nurse crop. It has\r\nbeen noticed that when so pastured, it does not winter so well, and that\r\nthe later and more close the pasturing and the colder the winter\r\nfollowing, the greater is the hazard from pasturing the clover. This\r\nhazard arises chiefly from the exposure of the roots to the sweep of the\r\ncold winds. It should be the rule, therefore, not only to refrain from\r\npasturing clover thus, but also to leave the stubbles high when\r\npasturing the grain. Where the snowfall is light and the cold is\r\nintense, to leave the stubbles thus high is important, since they aid in\r\nholding the snow. But there may be instances when the clover plants grow\r\nso vigorously that in places of heavy snowfall, smothering may result\r\nunless the mass of vegetation is in some way removed. In such instances,\r\npasturing may be in order; but when practised, the grazing should be\r\nwith cattle rather than sheep or horses, and it should cease before the\r\ncovering is removed. There may also be locations where much benefit\r\nfollows in several ways close, or reasonably close, cutting of the\r\nstubbles quite soon after the nurse crop has been harvested.\r\n\r\nWhen clover is sown without a nurse crop, it may be not only proper, but\r\nadvantageous, to pasture it. The grazing should not, however, be\r\ncontinued so late that the plants will not have time to make a\r\nsufficiency of growth to protect them in winter. Such grazing is better\r\nadapted to areas in which the season of growth is long, rather than\r\nshort; where weed growth is abundant, as on certain of the soils of the\r\nprairie, it may be necessary to call in the aid of the mower once or\r\neven twice during the season of growth.\r\n\r\nWhen a crop of medium red clover is desired, the surest way to obtain it\r\nin good form is to pasture the field during the early part of the\r\nseason, and closely enough to have the clover eaten down on every part\r\nof the field. When it is not so eaten, the mower should be so used that\r\nthe growth and maturing of the seed crop may be even and uniform. The\r\nseason for removing the live stock will depend upon latitude and\r\naltitude, but it will be correct to say that it ought to be from two to\r\nthree weeks earlier than the proper season for cutting clover for hay.\r\n\r\nWhen clover is not grazed the year that it is sown, in some seasons the\r\nstronger plants will bear seed, if allowed. To such an extent does this\r\nfollow under certain conditions and in certain areas, that a\r\nconsiderable crop of seed could be obtained if this were desired, even\r\nas many as 4 or 5 bushels per acre in some instances. But it has been\r\nnoticed that if thus allowed to produce seed, the effect upon the\r\ngrowth of the crop the next season is decidedly injurious. To prevent\r\nsuch a result the mower should be run over the field as soon as much\r\nhazard is certainly apparent, and the earlier in the season that this\r\ncan be done the better, for the reason that all weeds growing are\r\nclipped off, and the clover has also a better chance to provide\r\nprotection for the winter by growth subsequently made. When there is an\r\nover-luxuriant growth in the plants, it may be well to thus mow the\r\nfield, even though seed should not be produced. The growth made by the\r\nplants and the mulch provided by the portion cut make an excellent\r\npreparation for entering the cold season.\r\n\r\nBut few pasture crops grown will furnish as much grazing in one season\r\nas medium red clover. It will probably furnish the most grazing if\r\nallowed to grow up before it is grazed until the stage of bloom is\r\napproached or reached, but since it is seldom practicable to graze it\r\ndown quickly enough after that stage has been reached, and since there\r\nis frequently waste from tramping, grazing usually begins, and properly\r\nso, at an earlier period.\r\n\r\nWhen cattle and sheep graze upon young clover, there is some danger that\r\nhoven or bloating may result to the extent of proving quickly fatal if\r\nnot promptly relieved. The danger is greater if the animals are hungry\r\nwhen turned in upon the clover, and when it is wet with dew or rain, or\r\nin a more than ordinarily succulent condition. Such danger may be\r\nlessened, if not, indeed, entirely eliminated, by giving the animals\r\naccess to other food, as dry clover hay, for instance, before turning\r\nthem in on the pasture, and the danger is always less in proportion as\r\ngrasses are abundant in the pasture.\r\n\r\nShould bloating occur, relief must usually be prompt to be effective. In\r\nmild cases, certain medicines may bring relief. One of the most potent\r\nis the following: Give spirits of turpentine in doses of 1 to 5\r\ntablespoonfuls, according to the size of the animal. Dilute with milk\r\nbefore administering. In bad cases, the paunch should be at once\r\npunctured. The best instruments are the trocar and canula, but in the\r\nabsence of these a pocket knife and goose quill may be made to answer.\r\nThe puncture is made on the left side, at a point midway between the\r\nlast rib and hook point, and but a few inches from the backbone. The\r\nthrusting instrument should point downward and slightly inward going\r\ninto the paunch. With much promptness the canula or the quill should be\r\npushed down into the paunch and held there till the gas escapes. Before\r\nthe tube is withdrawn the contents of the paunch that have risen in the\r\nsame should be first pushed down.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting for Hay.=--Medium red clover is at its best for cutting for\r\nhay when in full bloom, and when a few of the heads which first bloomed\r\nare beginning to turn brown; that is to say, in the later rather than in\r\nthe earlier stage of full bloom. If cut sooner, the curing of the crop\r\nis tedious. If cut later the stalks lose in palatability. But when the\r\nweather is showery it may be better to defer cutting even for several\r\ndays after the clover has reached the proper stage for harvesting, as\r\nthe injury from rain while the crop is being cured may be greater than\r\nthe injury from overmaturity in the same before it is mown.\r\n\r\nWhen curing the crop, the aim should be to preserve to the greatest\r\nextent practicable the loss of the leaves. To accomplish such a result,\r\nthe clover ought to be protected as far as possible from exposure to dew\r\nor rain, and also from excessive exposure to sunshine. Dew injures more\r\nor less the color of the hay and detracts from its palatability. Rain\r\nintensifies such injury in proportion as the crop being harvested is\r\nexposed to it. It also washes out certain substances, which, when\r\npresent, affect favorably its aroma.\r\n\r\nThe injury from such exposure increases with the interval between\r\ncutting and storing the crop. Exposure to successive showers may so\r\nseriously injure the hay as to render it almost valueless for feeding.\r\nAfter the mown clover has been exposed in the swath to the sunlight\r\nbeyond a certain time, it turns brown, and if exposed thus long enough\r\nthe aroma will be lost. The aim should be, therefore, to cure the clover\r\nto the greatest extent practicable by the aid of the wind rather than by\r\nthat of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe method of procedure to be followed is in outline as given below: Mow\r\nas far as possible when the meadow is not wet with rain or dew. Mow in\r\nthe afternoon rather than the forenoon, as the injury from dew the night\r\nfollowing will be less. Stir with the tedder as soon as the clover has\r\nwilted somewhat. The tedder should be used once, twice or oftener as\r\nthe circumstances may require. The heavier the crop and the less drying\r\nthe weather, the more the tedding that should be given. Sometimes\r\ntedding once, and in nearly all instances twice, will be sufficient. The\r\nhay should then be raked. It is ready for being raked as soon as the\r\nwork can be done easily and in an efficient manner. When clover is not\r\ndry enough for being raked, the draught on the rake will be\r\nunnecessarily heavy, the dumping of the hay will be laborious, and it\r\ndoes not rake as clean as it would if the hay were in a fit condition\r\nfor being raked.\r\n\r\nThe aim should be to have the crop put up in heaps, usually called\r\n\"cocks,\" but sometimes called \"coils,\" before the second night arrives\r\nafter the mowing of the clover; and in order to accomplish this, it may\r\nbe necessary to work on until the shades of evening are drawing near.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a reasonable certainty that the weather shall continue\r\ndry, it is quite practicable to cure clover in the winrow, but in\r\nshowery weather to attempt to do so would mean ruin to the clover. In no\r\nform does it take injury so quickly from rain as in the winrow, and when\r\nrain saturates it, much labor is involved in spreading it out again. Nor\r\nis it possible to make hay quite so good in quantity when clover is\r\ncured in the winrow, as the surface exposed to the sunshine is much\r\ngreater than when it is mixed with timothy or some other grass that\r\npurpose, nevertheless, to cure it thus, especially when it is mixed with\r\ntimothy or some other grass that cures more easily and readily than\r\nclover. It may also be taken up with the hay-loader when cured thus,\r\nwhich very much facilitates easy storing. But when it is to be lifted\r\nwith the hay-loader, the winrows should be made small rather than large.\r\n\r\nWhen the clover is to be put up into cocks, these should be small rather\r\nthan large, if quick curing is desired. In making these, skilled labor\r\ncounts for much. The cocks are simply little miniature stacks. The part\r\nnext to the ground has less diameter than the center of the cock. As\r\neach forkful is put on after the first, the fork is turned over so that\r\nthe hay spreads out over the surface of the heap as it is being\r\ndeposited. Smaller forkfuls are put on as the top is being reached. The\r\ncenter is kept highest when making the cock. Each one may be made to\r\ncontain about 100 pounds and upward of cured hay, but in some instances\r\nthey should not contain more than half the amount to facilitate drying.\r\nWhen the heap has become large enough, the inverted fork should be made\r\nto draw down on every side the loose portions, which in turn are put\r\nupon the top of the cock. Such trimming is an important aid to the\r\nshedding of rain. An expert hand will put up one of these cocks of hay\r\nin less time than it takes to read about how it is done.\r\n\r\nA light rain will not very much injure a crop of clover after it has\r\nbeen put up into cocks, but a soaking rain will probably penetrate them\r\nto the bottom. To guard against this, in localities where the rainfall\r\nmay be considerable in harvest time, hay caps are frequently used. These\r\nmay be made from a good quality of unbleached muslin or strong cotton,\r\nor they may be obtained from some of those who deal in tent awnings and\r\nstack covers. When of good quality and well cared for they should last\r\nfor 10 to 20 years. Care should be taken in putting them on lest the\r\nwind which frequently precedes a thunder storm should blow them away.\r\nThe pins used at the corners of the caps should be carefully and firmly\r\ninserted in the hay or the ground, or the caps should have sufficiently\r\nheavy weights attached to them at the corners to prevent their lifting\r\nwith the wind. In putting up the hay the size of the cocks should be\r\nadjusted to the size of the covers used. One person should apply the\r\ncovers as quickly as two will put up the hay.\r\n\r\nWhen clover hay is put up into cocks, it undergoes what is termed the\r\n\"heating\" process; that is, it becomes warm in the center of the heaps\r\nup to a certain point, after which the heat gradually leaves it. The\r\nheat thus generated is proportionate to the size of the cocks and the\r\namount of moisture in the clover. The sweating process usually covers\r\ntwo or three days, after which the hay is ready for being stored. When\r\nclover is cured in the winrow, it does not go through the sweating\r\nprocess to the same extent as when cured in the cock; hence, it is\r\nliable to sweat in the mow, and to such an extent as to induce mold, if\r\nit has been stored away with moisture in it beyond a certain degree. If\r\na wisp of clover is taken from the least cured portion of the winrow or\r\ncock, and twisted between the hands, it is considered ready for being\r\nstored if no liquid is discernible. If overcured, when thus twisted it\r\nwill break asunder. A skilled workman can also judge fairly well of the\r\ndegree of the curing by the weight when lifted with the fork.\r\n\r\nUnder some conditions, it may be advisable to \"open out\" the cocks two\r\nor three hours before drawing them, that the hot sunshine may remove\r\nundue moisture. When this is done, if the cocks are taken down in\r\ndistinct forkfuls, as it were, each being given a place distinct from\r\nthe others, the lifting of these will be much easier than if the clover\r\nin each cock had been strewn carelessly over the ground. The lowest\r\nforkful in the cock should be turned over, since the hay in it will have\r\nimbibed more or less of dampness from the ground. But in some instances\r\nthe weather for harvesting is so favorable that the precaution is\r\nunnecessary of thus opening out the cocks or even of making them at all.\r\n\r\n=Storing.=--Storing clover under cover is far preferable to putting it\r\nup in stacks, except in rainless climates. With the aid of the\r\nhay-loader in lifting it from winrows in the field, and of the hay fork\r\nin unloading, the hand labor in storing is greatly reduced, but when it\r\nis unloaded with the horse fork, the aim should be to dump the hay from\r\nthe fork on different parts of the mow or stack, lest it should become\r\ntoo solidly pressed together under the dump, and heat and mold in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nWhen the hay is stacked, especially in climates of considerable\r\nrainfall, a bottom should be prepared on which to stack it. This may be\r\nmade of poles or rails. A few of these should first be laid one way on\r\nthe ground and parallel, and others across them. Where such material\r\ncannot be had, old straw or hay of but little value should be spread\r\nover the stack bottom to a considerable depth. Where these precautions\r\nare not taken, the hay in the bottom of the stack will be spoiled for\r\nsome distance upward by moisture ascending from the ground. In building\r\nthe stack, the center should be kept considerably higher than the outer\r\nedges, that rain may be shed, and the width of the same should increase\r\nup to at least two-thirds of the height, the better to protect the hay\r\nunderneath. The tramping should be even, or the hay in settling will\r\ndraw to one side, and the topping out should be gradual rather than\r\nabrupt.\r\n\r\nIn topping out a clover stack some hay should be used not easily\r\npenetrated by rain, as, for instance, blue grass obtained from fence\r\ncorners, or slough hay obtained from marshes. The last-named is better\r\nput on green. If the clover is not thus protected, a considerable\r\nquantity will spoil on the top of the stacks. It is not a good hay to\r\nturn rain. The shape of the stack should in a considerable degree be\r\ndetermined by its size. It is probably preferable to make small stacks\r\nround, since they are more easily kept in shape, but large stacks should\r\nbe long rather than round, as large, round stacks call for undue height\r\nin bringing them to a top. Because of the ease with which rain\r\npenetrates clover, it is very desirable to have it put under a roof.\r\nWhere it cannot be protected by the roof of a barn or stable, the aim\r\nshould be to store it in a hay shed; that is to say, a frame structure,\r\nopen on all sides and covered with a roof. Such sheds may be\r\nconstructed in a timber country without great cost.\r\n\r\nShould the clover hay be stored a little undercured, some growers favor\r\nsowing salt, say, from 4 to 8 quarts over each load when spread over the\r\nmow. They do so under the conviction that its preservative qualities\r\nwill be to some extent efficacious in preventing the hay from molding,\r\nand that it adds to the palatability of the hay. While it may render\r\nsome service in both of these respects, it would seem probable that the\r\nbenefits claimed have been overrated.\r\n\r\nThe more frequently clover hay is handled, the more is its feeding value\r\nimpaired, because of the loss of heads and leaves which attend each\r\nhandling of the crop. Because of this, it is not so good a crop for\r\nbaling as timothy, and also for other reasons. It should be the aim when\r\nstoring it for home feeding to place it where it can be fed as far as\r\npossible directly from the place of storage. In the location of hay\r\nsheds, therefore, due attention should be given to this matter.\r\n\r\nIn climates that are moist, some growers store clover in a mow when it\r\nhas only reached the wilting stage in the curing process. When thus\r\nstored it is preserved on the principle which preserves silage. The aim\r\nis when storing to exclude the air as far as possible by impacting the\r\nmass of green clover through its own weight, aided by tramping. It\r\nshould be more or less wilted before being stored, according to the\r\nsucculence in it, and it is considered highly important that it shall\r\nalso be free from external moisture. When thus stored it should be in\r\nlarge mows, and it should be well tramped, otherwise the impaction may\r\nnot be sufficient. To this method of storage there are the following\r\nobjections: 1. The hay has to be handled while it is yet green and wet.\r\n2. There is hazard that much of the hay will be spoiled in unskilled\r\nhands. 3. Under the most favorable conditions more or less of the clover\r\nis pretty certain to mold near the edges of the mass. Where clover can\r\nbe made into hay in the ordinary way without incurring much hazard of\r\nspoiling, the practice of storing it away in the green form, except in a\r\nsilo, would seem of questionable propriety. The making of clover into\r\nensilage is discussed in the book \"Soiling Crops and the Silo\" by the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\n=Securing Seed.=--As a rule, seed is not produced from the first cutting\r\nfor the season of medium red clover. It is claimed that this is due to\r\nlack of pollenization in the blossoms, and because they are in advance\r\nof the active period of working in bumble bees, the medium through which\r\nfertilization is chiefly effected. This would seem to be a sufficient\r\nexplanation as to why medium red clover plants will frequently bear seed\r\nthe first year, if allowed to, though the first cutting from older\r\nplants will have little or no seed. But it is claimed that the ordinary\r\nhoney bee may be and is the medium for fertilizing alsike and small\r\nwhite clover, but not that through which the mammoth variety is\r\nfertilized.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown, further, that, as a rule, better crops of clover\r\nseed may be obtained from clover that has been pastured off than from\r\nthat which has been mown for hay, although to this rule there are some\r\nexceptions. This arises, in part, from the fact that the energies of the\r\nplant have been less drawn upon in producing growth, and, therefore, can\r\nproduce superior seed heads and seed, and in part from the further fact\r\nthat there is usually more moisture in the soil at the season when the\r\nplants which have been pastured off are growing. There would seem to be\r\nsome relation between the growing of good crops of clover seed and\r\npasturing the same with sheep. It has been claimed that so great is the\r\nincrease of seed in some instances from pasturing with sheep till about\r\nJune 1st, say, in the latitude of Ohio, that the farmer who has no sheep\r\ncould afford to give the grazing to one who has, because of the extra\r\nreturn in seed resulting. The best crops of seed are obtained when the\r\ngrowth is what may be termed medium or normal. Summers, therefore, that\r\nare unusually wet or dry are not favorable to the production of clover\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nIf weeds are growing amid the clover plants that are likely to mature\r\nseed, they should, where practicable, be removed. The Canada thistle,\r\nragweed, plantain and burdock are among the weeds that may thus ripen\r\nseeds in medium clover. When not too numerous they can be cut with the\r\nspud. When too numerous to be thus cut, where practicable, they should\r\nbe kept from seeding with the aid of the scythe. To prevent them from\r\nmaturing is important, as the seeds of certain weeds cannot be\r\nseparated from those of clover with the fanning mill, they are so alike\r\nin size.\r\n\r\nThe crop is ready for being cut when the heads have all turned brown,\r\nexcept a few of the smaller and later ones. It may be cut by the mower\r\nas ordinarily used, by the mower, with a board or zinc platform\r\nattachment to the cutter bar, by the self-rake reaper, or by the grain\r\nbinder. The objection to the first method is that the seed has to be\r\nraked and that the raking results in the loss of much seed; to the\r\nsecond, that it calls for an additional man to rake off the clover; and\r\nto the third, that the binder is heavier than the self-rake reaper. The\r\nlatter lays the clover off in loose sheaves. These may be made large or\r\nsmall, as desired, and if care is taken to lay them off in rows, the\r\nlifting of the crop is rendered much easier.\r\n\r\nWhen the clover is cut with the mower, it should be raked into winrows\r\nwhile it is a little damp, as, for instance, in the evening. If raked in\r\nthe heat of the day many of the heads will break off and will thus be\r\nlost. From the winrows it is lifted with large forks. When the crop is\r\nlaid off in sheaves it may be necessary to turn them once, even in the\r\nabsence of rain, but frequently this is not necessary. In the turning\r\nprocess gentle handling is important, lest much of the seed should be\r\nlost. The seed heads of a mature crop break off very easily in the hours\r\nof bright sunshine. Rather than turn the sheaves over, it may be better,\r\nin many instances, just to lift them with a fork with many tines, and\r\nset them down easily again on ground which is not damp under them, like\r\nunto that from which they have been removed.\r\n\r\nClover seed may be stored in the barn or stack, or it may be threshed\r\ndirectly in the field or from the same. The labor involved in handling\r\nthe crop is less when it is threshed at once than by any other method,\r\nbut frequently at such a busy season it is not easily possible to secure\r\nthe labor required for this work. It is usually ready for being threshed\r\nin two or three days after the crop has been cut, but when the weather\r\nis fair it may remain in the field for as many weeks after being\r\nharvested without any serious damage to the seed. If, however, the\r\nstraw, or \"haulm,\" as it is more commonly called, is to be fed to live\r\nstock, the more quickly that the threshing is done after harvesting, the\r\nmore valuable will the haulm be for such a use.\r\n\r\nWhen stored in the barn or stack, it is common to defer threshing until\r\nthe advent of frosty weather, for the reason, first, that the seed is\r\nthen more easily separated from the chaff which encases it; and second,\r\nthat farm work is not then so pressing. When threshed in or directly\r\nfrom the field, bright weather ought to be chosen for doing the work,\r\notherwise more or less of the seed will remain in the chaff.\r\n\r\nIn lifting the crop for threshing or for storage, much care should be\r\nexercised, as the heads break off easily. The fork used in lifting it,\r\nwhether with iron or with wooden prongs, should have these long and so\r\nnumerous that in lifting the tines would go under rather than down\r\nthrough the bunch to be lifted. The wagon rack should also be covered\r\nwith canvas, if all the seed is to be saved. If stored in stacks much\r\ncare should be used in making these, as the seed crop in the stack is\r\neven more easily injured by rain than the hay crop. The covering of old\r\nhay of some kind that will shed rain easily should be most carefully put\r\non.\r\n\r\nYears ago the idea prevailed that clover seed could not be successfully\r\nthreshed until the straw had, in a sense, rotted in the field by lying\r\nexposed in the same for several weeks. The introduction of improved\r\nmachinery has dispelled this idea. The seed is more commonly threshed by\r\na machine made purposely for threshing clover called a \"clover huller.\"\r\nThe cylinder teeth used in it are much closer than in the ordinary grain\r\nseparator. The sieves are also different, and the work is less rapidly\r\ndone than if done by the former. During recent years, however, the seed\r\nis successfully threshed with an ordinary grain threshing machine, and\r\nthe work of threshing is thus more expeditiously done. Certain\r\nattachments are necessary, but it is claimed that not more than an hour\r\nis necessary to put these in place, or to prepare the machine again for\r\nthreshing grain.\r\n\r\nSince the seed is not deemed sufficiently clean for market as it comes\r\nfrom the machine, it should be carefully winnowed by running it through\r\na fanning mill with the requisite equipment of sieves. It is important\r\nthat this work should be carefully done if the seed is to grade as No. 1\r\nin the market. If it does not, the price will be discounted in\r\nproportion as it falls below the standard. A certain proportion of the\r\nseed thus separated will be small and light. This, if sold at all, must\r\nbe sold at a discount. If mixed with weed seeds it should be ground and\r\nfed to some kind of stock.\r\n\r\nThe haulm, when the seed crop has been well saved, has some feeding\r\nvalue, especially for cattle. If not well saved it is only fit for\r\nlitter, but even when thus used its fertilizing value is about\r\ntwo-thirds that of clover hay. More or less seed remains in the chaff,\r\nand because of this the latter is sometimes drawn and strewn over\r\npastures, or in certain by places where clover plants are wanted. Seed\r\nsown in the chaff has much power to grow, owing, it is thought, to the\r\nability of the hull enclosing the seed to hold moisture. The yields in\r\nthe seed crops of medium red clover vary all the way from 1 to 8 bushels\r\nper acre. The average yields under certain conditions are from 3 to 4\r\nbushels per acre. Under conditions less favorable, from 2 to 3 bushels.\r\n\r\nWithin the past two decades the seed crop has been seriously injured by\r\nan insect commonly spoken of as the clover midge (_Cecidomyia\r\nleguminicola_) which preys upon the heads so that they fail to produce.\r\nA field thus affected will not come properly into bloom. The remedy\r\nconsists in so grazing or cutting the clover that the bloom will come at\r\nthat season of the summer when the insects do not work upon the heads.\r\nThis season can only be determined by actual test. In Northern areas it\r\ncan usually be accomplished by pushing the period of bloom usual for the\r\nsecond crop two to four weeks forward.\r\n\r\n=Renewing.=--When clover is grown for hay, it is not usual to try to\r\nrenew the crop, because of the short-lived period of the plant. But in\r\nsome instances it has been found advantageous. On light prairie soils\r\nsandy in texture, located in the upper Mississippi basin, it has been\r\nfound possible to grow timothy meadow for several years in succession\r\nwith a goodly sprinkling of clover in it without re-seeding. In such\r\ninstances, the land is not pastured at all, except in seasons quite\r\nfavorable to growth, and in these the pasturing is not close. The clover\r\nplants that grow after the crop has been cut for hay produce seed. The\r\nheads in due time break off and are scattered more or less over the soil\r\nby the winds. In time they disintegrate, and more or less of the seed\r\ngerminates, thus forming new plants, some of which, especially in\r\nfavorable seasons, retain their hold upon the soil. This method may be\r\nworthy of imitation in localities where it has been found difficult to\r\nget a stand in dry seasons on this class of soils.\r\n\r\nWhen the stand of clover secured is variable, that is to say, partial,\r\nas when the clover is abundant in the lower portions of the land and\r\nentirely absent on the higher ground, it may be worth while to re-sow\r\nthe seed on the latter early the following spring. But before doing so,\r\nthe land should be carefully disked in the fall, and the clover seed\r\nharrowed or otherwise covered in the spring. Should the summer following\r\nprove favorable, the seed thus sown may produce hay, but not likely in\r\ntime to be harvested with the other portions of the field. But though it\r\nshould not produce much hay the seed is likely to be benefited to an\r\nextent that will far more than repay the outlay involved in labor and\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nIf the clover has been sown for pasture, the renewal of the same on\r\nhigher ground may be made as stated above, but with the difference that\r\nthe same kind or kinds of grain may also be sown at the same time as the\r\nclover is becoming rooted.\r\n\r\nIn pastures, medium red clover may be renewed whenever the attempt is\r\nmade to renew the pastures, as by disking them and then sowing upon them\r\nthe seeds of certain grasses or clovers or both. The disking is usually\r\ndone in the spring and while the frost is out for only a short distance\r\nbelow the surface. The amount of seed to sow need not be large, usually\r\nnot more than 2 or 3 pounds per acre, especially when seed of other\r\nvarieties is sown at the same time. One stroke of the harrow following\r\nwill provide a sufficient covering for the seed.\r\n\r\n=Clover as a Fertilizer.=--It would probably be correct to say that no\r\nplant has yet been introduced into American agriculture that has been\r\nfound so generally useful as clover in fertilizing land and in improving\r\nthe mechanical condition. Some who have investigated claim that there is\r\nmore nitrogen in a clover sod after the removal of a good crop of clover\r\nthan will suffice for four average farm crops, more phosphoric acid than\r\nwill suffice for two, and more potash than will suffice for six. It\r\nbegins to draw nitrogen from the air as soon as the tubercles commence\r\nto form and continues to add thus to the enrichment of the land during\r\nall the succeeding period of active growth. As previously stated, the\r\nnitrogen is drawn in great part from the air; consequently, soil from\r\nwhich a bountiful crop of clover has been removed will be considerably\r\nricher in nitrogen than before it grew the same, and this will hold true\r\nas intimated above, even though the crop should be removed and sold.\r\nUnder the same conditions it will also be true in available phosphoric\r\nacid and potash. But the latter are gathered from the soil and subsoil\r\nwhile the plants were growing. Consequently, if crops of clover are\r\ngrown in short rotation periods and if no fertilizer is given to the\r\nland other than the clover brings to it, while it will be abundantly\r\nsupplied with nitrogen, a time will come when the supply of phosphoric\r\nacid and potash may be so reduced that the soil will not grow even good\r\ncrops of clover. When this point is reached the soil is spoken of as\r\n\"clover sick.\" Happily, however, nearly all soils are so well stored\r\nwith phosphoric acid and potash that this result is not likely to follow\r\nfor many years. But lest it should, attention should be given to\r\nfertilizing the land occasionally with farmyard manure, or with\r\nphosphoric acid and potash applied as commercial fertilizers. Because of\r\nthis, and also for other reasons, it is usually considered more\r\nprofitable in the end to feed clover on the farm and return it to the\r\nland in the form of manure. But clover may cease to grow on land where\r\nonce it grew well, because of other reasons, such as changes in the\r\nmechanical condition of the soil caused by the depletion of its humus\r\nand changes in its chemical condition, such as increased acidity. The\r\nremedy is the removal of the cause.\r\n\r\nThe roots also put large quantities of humus in the soil. Where crops\r\nare regularly grown in short rotations they will suffice to keep it\r\namply supplied for ordinary production. Because of this it is usually\r\nconsidered more profitable to cut both the crops which medium red clover\r\nproduces in one season, or to pasture off one or both, than to plow\r\nunder either as green manure. But when soils are too stiff or too open\r\nin character it may be advantageous to bury clover to restore the\r\nequilibrium. It may also be necessary to bury an occasional crop in\r\norder to put the land quickly in a condition to produce some desired\r\ncrop, the growth of which calls for large supplies of humus. When clover\r\nis plowed under it will usually be found more profitable to bury the\r\nsecond growth of the season than the first. The crop is in the best\r\ncondition for being plowed under when the plants are coming into bloom.\r\nIf left until the stems lose their succulence the slow decay following\r\nin conjunction with the bulkiness of the mass plowed under might prove\r\nharmful to the crop following the clover. The influence of the roots\r\nupon the mechanical condition of the soil is most beneficial. The roots\r\ngo down deep into the subsoil and also abound in fibrous growth. The tap\r\nroots in their decay furnish openings through which the superfluous\r\nwater may go down into the subsoil. The fibers adhering to the main\r\nroots so ramify through the soil that when even stiff land is filled\r\nwith them it is rendered friable, and is consequently brought into a\r\ngood mechanical condition.\r\n\r\nWhile all varieties of clover may be utilized in producing food and in\r\nenriching land, none is equal to the medium red for the two purposes\r\ncombined. This arises from the fact that none save the medium red grows\r\ntwo crops in one season under ordinary conditions. Though the first crop\r\nshould be taken for food, as it generally is, there is still ample time\r\nfor a second crop to grow for plowing under the same season. This second\r\ngrowth is ready for being plowed under when time is less valuable than\r\nit would be when the mammoth or alsike varieties would be in season for\r\nbeing thus covered. And yet the work may be done sufficiently early to\r\nadmit of sowing fall or winter crops on the land which produced the\r\nclover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nALFALFA\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa (_Medicago sativa_) previous to its introduction into\r\nCalifornia, from Chili, about the middle of the last century, was\r\nusually known by the French name Lucerne. The name Alfalfa is probably\r\nArabic in its origin, and the term Lucerne has probably been given to it\r\nfrom the Canton Lucerne in Switzerland. It has followed the plant into\r\nSpain and South America, and now it seems probable that soon it will be\r\nknown by no other name over all the United States and Canada. It has\r\nalso been known by names applied to it from various countries for which\r\nit has shown high adaptation, as, for instance, Sicilian Clover, Mexican\r\nClover, Chilian Clover, Brazilian Clover, Styrian Clover and Burgundy\r\nClover. In yet other instances, names have been applied to it indicative\r\nof some peculiarity of growth, as, for instance, Branching Clover,\r\nPerennial Clover, Stem Clover and Monthly Clover.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is upright and branching in its habit of growth, more so than\r\nthe common varieties of clover. It usually grows to the height of 2 to 3\r\nfeet, but it has been known to reach a much greater height. Although\r\npossessed of a single stem when the plants are young, the number of the\r\nstems increases up to a certain limit, with the age of the plants and\r\nthe number of the cuttings. Forty to fifty stalks frequently grow up\r\nfrom the crown of a single plant where the conditions are quite\r\nfavorable to growth, and in some instances as many as a hundred. The\r\nleaves are not large, but numerous, and in the curing of the plants they\r\ndrop off much more easily than those of the more valuable of the\r\nclovers. The flowers are borne toward the top of the stems and branches,\r\nand they are in a long cluster, rather than in a compact head. They are\r\nusually of a bluish tint, but the shades of the color vary with the\r\nstrain from blue to pink and yellow. The seeds are borne in spirally\r\ncoiled pods. They resemble those of red clover in size, but are less\r\nuniform in shape. The color should be a light olive green. The tap roots\r\ngo down deeply into the soil and subsoil where the conditions as to\r\ntexture and moisture are favorable. It has been claimed that alfalfa\r\nroots have gone down into congenial subsoils 40 to 50 feet, but usually\r\nless, probably, than one-fourth of the distances mentioned would measure\r\nthe depths to which the roots go. And with decreasing porosity in the\r\nsubsoil, there will be decrease in root penetration until it will reach\r\nin some instances not more than 3 to 4 feet. But where the roots are\r\nthus hindered from going deeper, they branch out more in their search\r\nfor food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Alfalfa (_Medicago sativa_)\r\n  Oregon Experiment Station]\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is perennial. In the duration of its growth, no fodder plant\r\ngrown under domestication will equal it. It has been known, it is\r\nclaimed, to produce profitable crops for half a century. In some of the\r\nWestern States are meadows from 25 to 40 years old. Ordinarily,\r\nhowever, the season of profitable growth is not more than, say, 6 to 12\r\nyears when grown on upland soils. The meadows usually become more or\r\nless weedy or possessed by various grasses, and some of the plants die.\r\nThe plants at first send up a single stem. When this matures or is cut\r\nback the uncut portion of the stem dies down to the crown of the plant,\r\nwhich then sends out other stems. This is repeated as often as the stems\r\nare cut down until many stems grow up from one plant as indicated above,\r\nunless the plants are so crowded that such multiplication is more or\r\nless hindered. The plants grow rapidly as soon as spring arrives, and as\r\noften as cut off they at once spring again into vigorous life, where the\r\nconditions are favorable to such growth; hence, from one to twelve\r\ncuttings of soiling may be obtained in a single season, the former\r\nresult being obtained in arid climates, where the conditions are\r\nunpropitious, and the latter being possible only in congenial soils,\r\nwhere the winters are very mild and where the soils are irrigated.\r\nUsually, however, even on upland soils and in the absence of irrigation,\r\nnot fewer than 3 to 5 cuttings of soiling food are obtained each year\r\nand not fewer than 2 to 4 crops of hay.\r\n\r\nA number of varieties so called are grown in this country. They differ\r\nfrom each other more, however, in their adaptation in essential\r\nproperties relating to the quality of the pasture and fodder produced,\r\nthan in the quality of food product obtained from them. The variety\r\ncommonly grown from seed produced in the West is usually spoken of\r\nsimply as alfalfa, while that grown from seed European in origin has\r\nbeen more commonly called Lucerne. The former of these has a tendency to\r\ngrow taller than the latter and to send its roots down to a greater\r\ndepth. In addition to these, such strains as the Turkestan, the Rhenish,\r\nthe Minnesota and Sand Lucerne have been introduced.\r\n\r\nThe Turkestan variety was introduced by the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture during recent years. It was brought from provinces beyond\r\nthe Caspian in Russia, Asia. The object sought was to introduce a\r\nvariety that would better withstand the rigors of a climate dry in\r\nsummer and cold in winter than the variety commonly grown. Some strains\r\nof this variety have proved drought resistant to a remarkable degree. It\r\nhas also shown itself capable of enduring without injury temperatures so\r\nlow as to result in the destruction of plants of the common variety. In\r\ntrials made by growers in North Dakota and Northern Minnesota, it has\r\nbeen found able to endure the winter's cold in these areas. But it has\r\nalso been found that while the plants produced some seed in the Central\r\nMountain States, they did not produce much seed when grown in the\r\nNorthern States. Unless seed can be secured from plants grown in the\r\nlatter in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of growers, it is\r\nfeared that in time some of the hardy characteristics of this variety\r\nwill be lost if the Central and Southern Mountain States must be relied\r\nupon as the American sources of seed supplies.\r\n\r\nThe Rhenish strain comes from Central Europe. It has been highly\r\ncommended by some European seedsmen for its hardihood, but it has been\r\nas yet grown to only a limited extent in America. The Minnesota strain\r\nwas doubtless brought to Carver County by German farmers, by whom it has\r\nbeen grown in the neighborhood of Lake Waconia for nearly 20 years. It\r\nhas been found much hardier than the common variety when grown in that\r\nneighborhood, and the endurance of plants grown from seed of this strain\r\nfar northward has been very pronounced. As this variety produces\r\nreasonably good seed crops in Central Minnesota, it would seem\r\nreasonable to expect that it will become popular in Northern areas. Sand\r\nLucerne, which comes from Central Europe, has considerable adaptation\r\nfor poor and light soils, and in trials made at the Michigan experiment\r\nstation was found possessed of distinctive merit for such soils.\r\n\r\nWhere alfalfa can be grown freely, it is unexcelled as a pasture for\r\nswine, and is in favor also as a pasture for horses. While cattle and\r\nsheep grazed upon it are exceedingly fond of it, the danger that it will\r\nproduce bloat in them is so frequently present as to greatly neutralize\r\nits value for such a use. It is a favorite pasture for fowls. In\r\nfurnishing soiling food where it produces freely, it is without an equal\r\nin all the United States. It is highly relished by all kinds of farm\r\nanimals, not excluding rabbits and goats, and when fed judiciously may\r\nbe fed in this form with perfect safety. Its high value in producing\r\nsuch food rests on its productiveness, its high palatability and the\r\nabundant nutrition which it contains. As a hay crop, it is greatly\r\nprized. Even swine may be wintered in a large measure on cured alfalfa\r\nhay.\r\n\r\nAs a fertilizer, the value of alfalfa will be largely dependent on the\r\nuse that is made of the plants. When pastured or fed upon the farm, the\r\nfertility resulting being put back upon the land, it ranks highly as a\r\nproducer of fertility. But this question is further discussed on page\r\n191. As a destroyer of weeds much will depend upon the way in which it\r\nis grown. This question also is discussed again. (See page 185.)\r\n\r\n=Distribution.=--It is thought that alfalfa is more widely distributed\r\nover the earth's surface, furnishes more food for live stock, and has\r\nbeen widely cultivated for a longer period than any other legume. It is\r\ngrown over wide areas of Asia, Europe, North and South America, and its\r\ncultivation is constantly extending. It was grown on the irrigated\r\nplains of Babylon long before the days of Nebuchadnezzar. It was the\r\nprincipal fodder used in the stables of the kings of Persia. From\r\nPersia, it is thought, it was brought to Greece about 470 B. C., and\r\nthat its cultivation in Italy began at least two centuries before the\r\nChristian era. Several Roman writers, as Virgil, Columella and Varro,\r\nmention it. From Italy it was introduced into Spain and from Spain it\r\nwas doubtless carried by missionaries of the Roman Catholic Church to\r\nMexico and the South American States which lie west of the Andes, as\r\nPeru and Chili. In the arid and semi-arid regions of the Andes, the\r\nconditions were found so favorable to the growth of alfalfa that it is\r\nnow the principal forage crop grown. It is almost certain that it was\r\nbrought from Chili to California, from which it has spread over much of\r\nthe cultivated portion of the arid and semi-arid west. Western grown\r\nseed is also the chief source of supply at the present time for all the\r\nStates of the Union.\r\n\r\nFully a century ago attempts were made by Chancellor Livingstone and\r\nothers to introduce it into the Eastern States, but without much\r\nsuccess, owing, probably, to the lack of knowledge on the part of the\r\npeople as to how it should be grown. The seed at that time was doubtless\r\nbrought from European sources, probably France. It has been noticed by\r\nmore recent growers in these States that the results from sowing such\r\nseed do not prove as satisfactory as those from American grown seed, but\r\nthat alone should not sufficiently explain why the attempts to grow\r\nalfalfa just referred to were not successful.\r\n\r\nBut it is not alone in the areas named that alfalfa has proved so\r\nhelpful to agriculture. In Central Asia and northward it has for long\r\ncenturies furnished the Tartars with the principal forage crop grown. In\r\nTurkestan and other places it will grow under conditions so dry as to\r\nforbid the vigorous growth of many hardy grasses. In Southern Asia, from\r\nIndia to Arabia, it has lost none of the popular favor accorded to it\r\nlong centuries ago. In Southern Russia it is extensively grown, and up\r\nand down the basin of the Danube. In the Mediterranean provinces of\r\nSouthern Europe it is still one of the leading forage crops. In France\r\nit stands high in the popular estimate, and also in some parts of\r\nGermany. And even in humid England it is grown more or less freely on\r\ndry, calcareous soils. And the day is doubtless near when in many parts\r\nof Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Eastern South America this great\r\nfodder plant will be found capable of yielding abundant harvests. In\r\nsome parts of Argentina it has been claimed that it grows like a weed.\r\n\r\nIt is believed by many that alfalfa if exposed to very low temperatures\r\nwill perish and that it cannot stand as much winter exposure as medium\r\nred or alsike clover. This is only true of some varieties. Other\r\nvarieties, as the Turkestan, for instance, will endure lower\r\ntemperatures and more exposure than the clovers named. Alfalfa has been\r\ngrown with some success at the government experiment station, Indian\r\nHead, Sask, Canada, and yet it sometimes winter kills in Texas. As with\r\nclover, it is injured most by exposure to sweeping winds blowing over it\r\nin winter when the mercury is low, and the injury is more fatal just\r\nafter the removal of a snow covering and when the plants are young. Ice\r\nforming over the fields after a sudden thaw and remaining for a time is\r\nvery liable to kill the plants. It can stand considerably more summer\r\nheat than any of the clovers grown northward, as witnessed in the good\r\ncrops grown in some parts of Louisiana during the hottest weather of\r\nsummer. Nevertheless, with reference to temperatures, what may be termed\r\na mild climate, such as characterizes Southern France in Europe and\r\nWestern California in the United States, is best adapted to its growth.\r\n\r\nIt is better adapted to climates that are dry, where the plants can be\r\nirrigated, as then rains do not interfere with the harvesting of the\r\nhay. Even in the absence of irrigation, a climate that is reasonably dry\r\nis preferable to one where drenching rains frequently fall, which wash\r\naway the soil when sandy, or which fill it full of water when composed\r\nof clay. But where rains fall frequently and in moderation, as in the\r\nnorthern Puget Sound region, the effect is helpful to the growth of the\r\nalfalfa plants, although it may add somewhat to the labor of making\r\nalfalfa hay, and to the hazard in curing it. Alfalfa will maintain its\r\nhold for years on some portions of the table lands of the mountain\r\nStates under conditions so dry that the plants can only furnish one\r\ncutting of hay in a season. It is safe to assume, therefore, that\r\nalfalfa can be grown under a wider range of climatic conditions than any\r\nother legume grown in the United States. But the influence which climate\r\nshould be allowed to exercise on the use that is to be made of it should\r\nnot be lost from view. In climates much subject to frequent rains in\r\nsummer, it should be grown rather for soiling food and pasture than for\r\nhay, whereas in dry climates, and especially where it can be irrigated,\r\nit should be grown for hay, soiling food and pasture, but especially the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nWhile alfalfa can be successfully grown in one or the other of its\r\nvarieties in some portion of every State in the Union, it has its\r\nfavorite feeding grounds. The best conditions for growing it are found\r\nin the valleys of all the Rocky Mountain States, where the growth can be\r\nregulated by the application of irrigating waters. In these the\r\nconditions southward are superior to those northward, because of the\r\nmilder climate, which precludes the danger of winter killing by\r\nexposure, which occasionally happens in the more northerly of the\r\nmountain States, and because of the more prolonged season for growth,\r\nwhich adds to the number of the cuttings. This does not mean that the\r\nriver bottoms in other parts of the United States will not be found good\r\nfor growing alfalfa. It can be grown in many of these; in fact, in\r\nnearly all of them, and to some extent by the aid of irrigation, if the\r\nwaste waters were stored, but the deposit soil in these valleys being of\r\nmuch closer texture than that in the western valleys, is, on the whole,\r\nlower in adaptation than the soil in the latter.\r\n\r\nIn the western valleys of the mountain States, alfalfa is the crop\r\naround which it may be said that agricultural production centers. It is\r\nthe principal hay crop of those States. The extent to which it may be\r\ngrown there is revolutionizing the production of live stock on the\r\nranges, as it is providing food for them in winter, which is fast\r\nremoving, and will probably soon entirely remove, the element of hazard\r\nfrom live stock dependent on the range pastures for support in that\r\nseason. The dairy and swine industries in those valleys must largely\r\ndepend upon it. Fruit orchards must ultimately grow on buried alfalfa\r\nmeadows, and the rotation of all crops in the same will be largely\r\ndependent upon the growing of alfalfa. Next in adaptation to the\r\nmountain States are, it is thought, certain soils that lie between the\r\nRocky Mountains and the Mississippi, especially such as are in proximity\r\nto rivers, or are underlaid with sheet water not far distant from the\r\nsurface. But an unusually large proportion of the upland soil in these\r\nStates, from Central Minnesota southward, have high adaptation for the\r\ngrowth of this plant. Particularly is this true of the soils of Nebraska\r\nand Kansas and of considerable portions of Missouri, Arkansas and\r\nLouisiana.\r\n\r\nIn States east of the Mississippi, the adaptation is not so general, and\r\nis more dependent on soil conditions than on those that are climatic. In\r\nnearly all of the river bottoms of these States it will grow with more\r\nor less success. On nearly all upland soils it will also grow well,\r\nwhere the subsoil furnishes naturally good drainage. For the exception,\r\nsee page 132. But in no State east of the Mississippi, is such a\r\nproportion of the area so highly adapted to growing alfalfa as in many\r\nof the States west of that river. In other States areas are found in\r\nwhich alfalfa will produce excellent crops, but usually these do not\r\nembrace the larger portion of the entire area in any State. In a\r\nconsiderable number of the States such areas are more or less limited,\r\nand usually they are distributed variously in the different States; that\r\nis, they do not lie side by side. The favorite soil conditions in these\r\nare a good loam, preferably more or less sandy and resting upon a porous\r\nsubsoil.\r\n\r\nA more exact idea will be given of relative adaptation in various States\r\nin what is now submitted. In California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and New\r\nMexico, alfalfa is now grown chiefly by the aid of irrigation, and all\r\nof these States have highest adaptation for its growth. In some parts of\r\nCalifornia 6 to 10 tons of cured hay are obtained in one year, with\r\npasture in winter additional. In Utah, good crops have been grown\r\nsuccessively on the same land for more than a quarter of a century. In\r\nColorado two cuttings are obtained the first season, and it is said that\r\nthere the plants are not easily destroyed. It yields enormously in the\r\nirrigated valleys of New Mexico and Arizona.\r\n\r\nIn Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, it is grown with and\r\nwithout irrigation. In large areas in all these States, excellent crops\r\nare and may be grown, but the season of growth being shorter, not so\r\nmany cuttings are obtained per year as in the mountain States further\r\nsouth. In Northern Idaho two cuttings may be obtained per year, even on\r\nhigh, dry land.\r\n\r\nIn North Dakota, especially westward, alfalfa gives promise of\r\nsuccessful growth. It will grow well in much of South Dakota, especially\r\non sandy soils not too distant from water. In Minnesota it has been\r\ngrown successfully in Carver County since 1886. Good success is being\r\nobtained from growing it in other parts of the State, even in some parts\r\nof the Red River valley. In Western Iowa it is being grown with much\r\nsuccess, and in some portions of Eastern Iowa. In Missouri, the two\r\nimportant centers for growing it are the northwest and the southeast,\r\nbut in other areas it has also done well. In Kansas it will grow well in\r\nall parts of the State where the subsoil is porous. It has been cut for\r\nhay in that State in less than 60 days from the date of sowing. It grows\r\nequally well over at least two-thirds of Nebraska, especially the\r\neastern half, and its growth in Nebraska is rapidly extending. In the\r\nArkansas valley it luxuriates, and it is also being grown in Oklahoma.\r\nIn Louisiana immense fields are being grown along the Red River and in\r\nother parts of the State. In Texas it is being grown more or less north,\r\neast and south, and especially in the valley of the Brazos.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States alfalfa has not in many instances been given a\r\ngood chance where tried. The plants have too frequently had to contend\r\nthere as elsewhere with ill-prepared and weedy soils and imprudent\r\npasturing. Yet it is being grown with considerable success, though as\r\nyet in limited areas, in all the Southern States. It has done well in\r\nparts of Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama, and in Georgia\r\nare some alfalfa meadows 25 years old. In the other Southeastern States,\r\nviz., Virginia, the Carolinas and Florida, it does well only in areas\r\nmore or less circumscribed, but it has been grown with some success even\r\nin the rainy climate of Southern Florida.\r\n\r\nIn the States northward from the Ohio River, that is, Illinois, Indiana,\r\nOhio, Michigan and Wisconsin, the necessity for growing alfalfa has not\r\nbeen so much felt as in some other States, because of the excellence of\r\nthe crops of clover grown in these. Its growth, however, is extending in\r\nall of these States. Much of the soil in Illinois, it is said, must\r\nfirst be inoculated with the bacteria proper to alfalfa before vigorous\r\ncrops can be grown, and this is probably true of sections of Indiana\r\nsoil. Some sections of Ohio are becoming noted for the crops of alfalfa\r\nwhich they have grown, and in Wisconsin Hon. W. D. Hoard succeeded in\r\nsecuring 5.7 tons of alfalfa hay in one season from four cuttings made\r\non three-fifths of an acre.\r\n\r\nIn all the Eastern and New England States, alfalfa is being grown to\r\nsome extent. In some counties of New York, as Onondaga and Madison, it\r\nis becoming the leading soiling and hay crop. In Massachusetts it has\r\nborne cuttings year after year on sandy loam soil. On Long Island three\r\nto four cuttings each season have been obtained for a series of years.\r\nIt is believed that it will grow over nearly the whole of Southern\r\nMaryland and also in much of the eastern part of that State, and its\r\ngrowth has been quite successful in parts of Delaware and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa will grow well in considerable areas in Canada. The statement\r\nwould seem safe that at the present time profitable crops could be grown\r\nin some parts of every province of Canada in which the land is tilled.\r\nIn Quebec, even on high land, it usually endures the winters. Near\r\nMontreal it has been cut for soiling food at the height of 30 inches as\r\nearly as May 15th. In some parts of Eastern Ontario good crops can be\r\ngrown, and also over considerable areas of Western Ontario. The author\r\ngrew it with much success at the experiment station at Guelph in 1890\r\nand subsequently, and during recent years considerable areas are being\r\ngrown in several of the Lake Erie counties and in those that lie north\r\nfrom them. But in no part of Ontario are the conditions for growing\r\nalfalfa better than in some of the mountain valleys of British Columbia.\r\n\r\nBut few crops, if, indeed, any, are being experimented with at the\r\npresent time to so great an extent as alfalfa; hence, the expectation is\r\nreasonable that there will be an enormous increase in the area grown in\r\nthe future that is near. The two chief causes of failure in the past\r\nwere want of knowledge in growing and caring for it on the part of the\r\ngrowers, and the absence of the proper bacteria in the soil. Acidity in\r\nsome soils and want of drainage in others are also responsible for many\r\nof the failures referred to. But even where it does grow reasonably\r\nwell, some trouble is found from the alfalfa failing in spots. In some\r\ninstances the cause can be traced, as when coated with ice in winter, or\r\nwhere the soil is not uniform, but in other instances the precise causes\r\nhave not been determined. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, however,\r\ngreatly increased areas will be grown in the future, especially in\r\nStates in which the dairy interest is paramount or even important.\r\n\r\n=Soils.=--It was formerly thought by many that alfalfa would only grow\r\nvigorously on soils and subsoils sandy in character, and underlaid at\r\nsome distance from the surface with water. It is now being ascertained\r\nthat it will grow on a great variety of soils, providing they are\r\nreasonably fertile, free from acidity, sufficiently porous below to\r\ncarry away water with reasonable quickness, and not underlaid with hard\r\npan or a subsoil so tenacious that it is almost impervious to water.\r\n\r\nThe best soils for alfalfa are those of the Western mountain States, and\r\nin these the deposit soils of the river valleys stand among the\r\nforemost. These soils are usually of much depth. Many of them have water\r\nunderneath, and the subsoil is usually so porous that the roots can go\r\nfar down in them, such is the character of nearly all the bottom land\r\nwest of the Mississippi. But in nearly all of the mountain region of the\r\nWest, from Banff in British Columbia to Mexico, alfalfa will grow well\r\nunder irrigation, or in the absence of irrigation, if ground water is\r\nnot too distant from the surface. In this region alfalfa grows more\r\nvigorously and more persistently than in almost any other portion of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn regions where alfalfa is not dependent upon irrigation, the best\r\nsoils probably are deep, rich calcareous loams, clay or sandy, and\r\nunderlaid with what may be termed a mild or reasonably porous clay\r\nsubsoil. With such soils the plants may be in no way influenced by sheet\r\nwater below, as on some of these in Nebraska, for instance, such water\r\nis fully 150 feet below the surface. These soils are usually possessed\r\nof abundant food supplies to nourish the plants, and the roots can go\r\nfar down into the subsoils to gather food and moisture. Such lands are\r\nfound more or less in nearly all the States of the Union east from the\r\nRocky Mountains; hence, when the requisite bacteria are present, good\r\ncrops can be grown on them in every State in the Union.\r\n\r\nOn the ordinary black soils of the prairie, alfalfa will usually grow\r\nreasonably well if underlaid with clay not too distant nor too\r\ntenacious. When the roots get down into the subsoil, they can usually\r\nfind much food in the same, and unless in very dry areas a sufficiency\r\nof moisture, but in many instances it may be necessary to introduce the\r\nrequisite bacteria, and to apply farmyard manure to encourage sufficient\r\ngrowth to carry the roots down quickly to the subsoil. In some prairie\r\nsoils the growth will be vigorous from the start, but usually these are\r\nlands that have grown hardwood timber, and that have in them more or\r\nless clay.\r\n\r\nIn climates where the rainfall is considerable, alfalfa will frequently\r\ngrow well on gravelly soils and on those that are stony. Some of the\r\nbest alfalfa soils in the State of New York, New England States, and in\r\nthe Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario are of this character.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa will frequently grow fairly well even on stiff clays, and in\r\nsome instances on gumbo soils. But these soils must not be so retentive\r\nas to collect and hold water for any considerable time within a few feet\r\nof the surface. Such lands have usually much staying power; hence,\r\nalfalfa grown on them frequently improves for years after it has been\r\nsown. On the reddish soils that cover much of the South, it has been\r\nfound, as in growing alfalfa on stiff clays in the North, that where\r\ndeep subsoiling is practiced alfalfa is not only more easily\r\nestablished, but it also grows with added vigor.\r\n\r\nOn upland soils sandy or gravelly in character where the rainfall is\r\nmuch less than normal and where the subsoil is not underlaid with sheet\r\nwater, alfalfa will not usually succeed, notwithstanding that it may\r\ngrow well on these soils where the rainfall is normal. On such soils it\r\nis not easy to get a stand of the plants, as they are much apt to perish\r\nin the dry weather of the first season, but if once established on such\r\nsoils the plants have much power to grow even where the rainfall is\r\nconsiderably less than normal.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa will not grow well in soils naturally wet until they are\r\ndrained. And when drained it will not grow with normal vigor, on what\r\nmay be termed slough soils, where the subsoil is far down and covered\r\nwith a deep covering of vegetable mold. What are termed slough soils in\r\nthe Western prairies, therefore, are not well fitted for the growth of\r\nalfalfa. On these it may not succeed well, when it may grow with much\r\nvigor on the adjoining upland. When some wet soils are drained, alfalfa\r\nmay not succeed well on them for a time and later may grow luxuriantly.\r\nThis may arise from the lack of time for proper aeration after being\r\ndrained, or from the want of lime to further correct acidity in the\r\nsoil, or from the want of the proper bacteria. Notwithstanding that\r\nalfalfa will not grow well on undrained lands that are naturally wet,\r\nand notwithstanding that it will perish if the roots reach standing\r\nwater at a distance too near the surface, the best crops by far are\r\nusually grown on irrigated lands. This arises, first, from the ability\r\nto adjust the supplies of water to meet the needs of the plants, and\r\nsecond, from the congenial character of the soil and subsoil. Next to\r\nthese the best crops are grown where congenial soils are underlaid with\r\nground water, not too near nor too distant from the surface. On these\r\nsoils the plants are largely supplied with moisture from the water below\r\nascending on the principle of capillary attraction. How near or how\r\ndistant such water should be will depend somewhat on subsoil conditions.\r\nIt would seem correct to say that it ought never to come nearer to the\r\nsurface than 3 feet, nor should it be more than 20 feet down. The most\r\nsuitable distance would be, say, 8 to 16 feet. When the roots of alfalfa\r\nreach water at too short a depth they will die.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa may sometimes be grown satisfactorily on soils subject to\r\noverflow, but usually there is hazard in growing it on these. If the\r\noverflow occurs comparatively early in the season, if it is not of great\r\ndepth, if it is of short duration, and if the waters quickly drain out\r\nof the subsoil possessed by the alfalfa, it may receive little or no\r\nharm from such overflow. Instances are on record wherein ice has formed\r\non alfalfa and yet the plants survived, but such a condition will\r\nusually prove fatal to them. But should the overflow take place in hot\r\nweather, usually it will injure the plants seriously, and may, indeed,\r\ncompletely destroy them. So great is such hazard, that care must be\r\ntaken against the application of an excess of irrigating waters under\r\nsuch conditions. Overflow waters that are stagnant are more injurious\r\nprobably than those that are in motion, owing, it may be, to the less\r\nsupply of dissolved oxygen in the former.\r\n\r\nSoils suitable in themselves, but lying on stiff clay bottoms or\r\nunderlaid with hard pan within two or three feet of the surface, will\r\nnot maintain a good stand of alfalfa. The plants in these may grow well\r\nfor a time, probably a year or two, after which they will fail. The\r\nroots are not able to go down to gather food. When the subsoils are\r\nsimply stiff clays, deep subsoiling, as already intimated, may render\r\nmuch service, but when composed of hard pan this may not be practicable.\r\nIn moist climates, however, reasonably good crops have been obtained\r\nfrom soils with underlying rock not more than four feet below the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe fact should not be overlooked that soils may have the requisite\r\nphysical conditions for growing alfalfa, and they may possess in fair\r\nsupply the essential elements of plant food, and yet alfalfa will not\r\nsucceed at the first when sown on these, because of the absence of the\r\nsoil bacteria, the presence of which is essential to the vigorous growth\r\nof the plants. Because of this, growers should be slow to conclude that\r\nalfalfa will not flourish on the soils on which they sow it until they\r\nhave first tried to grow it on those soils that have been inoculated\r\nwith the requisite alfalfa bacteria. For the methods of procedure in\r\nsuch cases see page 53. Some persons claim that soils which will grow\r\nmedium red clover in good form will also grow alfalfa in good form.\r\nThis does not necessarily follow. While there is much of similarity in\r\nthe soils suitable for the growth of both, alfalfa may fail on lands\r\nthat grow red clover luxuriantly until the bacteria proper to alfalfa\r\nhave been introduced. Soils may be tested for bacteria, and even in\r\nwinter, by sowing some seed in pots and treating them like\r\nwell-cared-for house plants. When the plants are 2 to 3 months old, if\r\ntubercles are found on the roots, the conclusion would seem safe that\r\nsuch soil does not require inoculation.\r\n\r\n=Place in the Rotation.=--In a certain sense it can scarcely be said of\r\nalfalfa that it is a rotation plant, because of the long term of years\r\nfor which it is grown in an unbroken succession. Nevertheless, in all\r\nplaces it cannot always be maintained for a long term of successive\r\nyears without renewal. In the Eastern States it is frequently, though\r\nnot always so crowded by various grasses, that the fields in which it\r\ngrows are broken up at some period short of ten years, and not\r\ninfrequently at the end of five or six years. When thus grown, it\r\nbecomes a rotation plant, though grown in what may be termed long\r\nrotations. But even in the West, where, under irrigation, it may be\r\ngrown for a quarter of a century or even for a longer period without\r\nrenewal, it may be used when desired in short rotations. In such\r\nsituations it grows so readily and becomes established so quickly, that\r\nthe fields may be broken with a view to alternate with other crops at\r\nthe end of the second year, or of any year subsequently from the sowing\r\nof the seed that may be desired. Alfalfa in these soils will serve even\r\nbetter than medium red clover in such situations, since while it is\r\ngrowing, it will produce more hay or soiling food, and consequently\r\nshould excel the former in the fertility which it makes available.\r\n\r\nEast of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio River, alfalfa will\r\nfrequently follow cultivated crops, as corn, potatoes and field roots,\r\nand when the fields are broken, it will be followed by crops other than\r\nlegumes. On many soils the influence which this crop has on relieving\r\nthe surface soil from excessive moisture, through channels opened into\r\nthe subsoil by the decaying roots, is so helpful as to considerably\r\nstimulate production in addition to the fertilizing influence which it\r\nexerts directly. Particularly good crops of corn, the small cereal\r\ngrains, and even field roots may be grown after alfalfa.\r\n\r\nOn soils east of the Mississippi and south of the Ohio, the rotation\r\nwill be somewhat similar. But on Southern soils alfalfa will frequently\r\nfollow immediately crops especially grown to be plowed under as green\r\nmanures for the benefit of the alfalfa. These crops include cow peas,\r\nsoy beans, crimson clover, and to a limited extent, burr clover. It will\r\nalso be followed frequently by crops of cotton and other non-leguminous\r\nplants, the growth of which in the United States is confined to the area\r\nnow being considered.\r\n\r\nIn the area west of the Mississippi and east of the semi-arid region\r\nbeside the mountains, alfalfa may follow the small cereal grains, and\r\nmay in turn be followed by them and also by millets. It may also follow\r\nand precede corn, or the non-saccharine sorghums, where the climatic\r\nconditions are suitable for growing the latter.\r\n\r\nIn the irrigated regions of the West, alfalfa may be made to serve\r\nalmost any purpose in the rotation that may be desired. By growing it as\r\na rotation crop in these valleys it may be made to furnish the soil\r\nindefinitely with supplies of nitrogen and humus. In these soils it may\r\nbe made to follow directly almost any crop grown on them, and similarly\r\nit may be made to precede the growth of almost any crop for which the\r\nlocality has marked adaptation. Small cereal grains, timothy,\r\nvegetables, field roots, potatoes, corn, small fruits and orchards may\r\nbe profitably grown on buried alfalfa meadows. This does not imply,\r\nhowever, that alfalfa meadows should not, as a rule, be maintained for a\r\nlong term of years.\r\n\r\n=Preparing the Soil.=--In preparing the soil for alfalfa the aim should\r\nbe to make a seed-bed clean, rich, fine, moist, even, and sufficiently\r\nfirm or friable, according to the conditions. The subsoil should also be\r\nmade sufficiently dry and open. From what has just been said, it will be\r\napparent that in properly preparing the seed-bed, it will be necessary\r\nto study closely the requisite conditions.\r\n\r\nThe advantage from having a clean seed-bed will be apparent when it is\r\ncalled to mind that alfalfa is a somewhat delicate plant when young, and\r\nthat because of this, it is ill able to overcome in the fight with\r\nweeds. Cleanness in the surface soil may be obtained by summerfallowing\r\nthe land, by growing a root crop or a crop of corn or any of the\r\nnon-saccharine sorghums. When the seed is spring sown, this preparation\r\nmust be given the year previously, but when autumn sown, it may be given\r\nthe same season. In preparing the land thus, the aim should be to make\r\nthe surface as clean as possible, rather than to get weed seeds out of\r\nthe lower strata of the cultivated soil, in which they will likely\r\nperish before the field sown to alfalfa is broken up again.\r\nSummerfallowing makes an excellent preparation for the land, because of\r\nthe fine opportunity which it furnishes for cleaning the same perfectly\r\nand leveling it off properly. The excellent condition in which it puts\r\nthe seed-bed, viewed from the standpoint of the duration of the years of\r\ncropping that are likely to follow, would seem to more than justify such\r\npreparation of the land. The outcome may more than justify the loss of\r\nthe crop for one season when thus summerfallowing the land. But it may\r\nnot be necessary to lose the production of one season whether the seed\r\nis sown spring or autumn, as the summerfallowing in the North may follow\r\nthe pasturing off of some crop, and in the South the interval for\r\nfallowing the land may be sufficiently long after the harvesting of an\r\nearly winter grain crop, before sowing the seed in the autumn. (See page\r\n136.)\r\n\r\nWhen sowing the seed autumn or spring, on land that is filled with weed\r\nseeds near the surface, it is frequently better to defer sowing the seed\r\nfor some weeks to give time for sprouting many of these than to sow at\r\nonce. This suggestion is specially applicable to spring sowing. It\r\nshould also be mentioned that when the weeds infesting the soil are\r\nannual or even biennial in character, the harm done to the alfalfa by\r\nthese will be much less than when the land is infested with perennials\r\nat the time of sowing. The former may be prevented from seeding by\r\nclipping back frequently, while the latter remain in the soil, increase\r\nfrom year to year, and injure the plants by crowding. Where crab grass\r\ngrows abundantly, as in some parts of the South, unless the alfalfa is\r\nsown and cultivated, spring sowing ought to be avoided. But it is less\r\nobjectionable to sow alfalfa on land that is weedy when the adaptation\r\nof the land for the crop is high than when it is low, as the alfalfa in\r\nthe former instance has so much more power to fight its own battle. On\r\ngood alfalfa soils, therefore, it may be wiser in some instances to sow\r\nalfalfa in weed-infested land than to defer sowing for a whole year in\r\norder to clean the land.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly important that the land shall be rich in available plant\r\nfood on which the seed is sown. If naturally poor, it should be well\r\nfertilized before sowing. When this cannot be done, it is better not to\r\nsow. A vast preponderance of the land in the Rocky Mountain region, when\r\nfirst broken, would seem to possess abundantly all the essential foods\r\nrequired by alfalfa; hence, for a time, at least, it is not necessary to\r\nenrich these before sowing the seed. The sandy and hungry gravelly\r\nsoils, which are considerable in the South, in the Atlantic States, and\r\nin some of the Central and Northern States, should be fertilized before\r\nlaying them down to alfalfa. Such fertilization usually calls for both\r\nhumus and readily available plant food, and these are most cheaply\r\nsupplied by growing certain green crops and plowing them under, or by\r\napplying farmyard manure. These may be supplemented when necessary by\r\ncommercial fertilizers. Some precede alfalfa on such soils by growing\r\ncow peas or soy beans, followed by crimson clover, both crops being\r\nplowed in, and shortly before sowing the alfalfa they apply more or less\r\nof phosphoric acid and potash, which is usually incorporated in the\r\nsurface soil by the harrow. On some soils, as in some parts of Florida,\r\ntwo successive crops of cow peas should be plowed under before sowing\r\nalfalfa. When farmyard manure can be used in fertilizing those leechy\r\nsoils it is well when it can be applied on the surface in a somewhat\r\ndecomposed form and also kept near the surface during the subsequent\r\ncultivation given when preparing the seed-bed. In the North it is best\r\napplied in the autumn or winter, and in the South in the summer. But on\r\nloam soils with a reasonably retentive subsoil, the better way to apply\r\nfarmyard manure is to make a heavy application of the same to the crop\r\npreceding the alfalfa. It has thus become incorporated with the soil,\r\nand many weed seeds in it will have sprouted before sowing the alfalfa.\r\nThe results from applying manure on soil somewhat stiff and not highly\r\nproductive have been noticeably marked. This may have been owing in part\r\nto the mechanical influence of the manure on the land. The relation\r\nbetween the free application of farmyard manure and abundant growth in\r\nalfalfa is so marked in all, or nearly all, soils west of the\r\nMississippi River that in many instances better crops will be obtained\r\nfrom poor soils well manured than from good soils unmanured. The\r\nrelation between abundant manuring and soil inoculation is worthy of\r\nmore careful study, in the judgment of the author, than has yet been\r\naccorded to it.\r\n\r\nFine pulverization of the surface soil is advantageous when sowing\r\nalfalfa, because of the influence which it has upon the retention of\r\nmoisture near the surface, and upon the exclusion from the soil of an\r\noverabundance of light. It is in clay soils, of course, that this\r\ncondition is most difficult to secure. The agencies in securing it are\r\nthe cultivator, the harrow and the roller, and in many instances the\r\ninfluences of weather, after the land has been plowed, especially when\r\nplowed in the autumn prior to spring seeding.\r\n\r\nMoistness in the seed-bed sufficient to promptly sprout the seed is a\r\nprime essential, but it is very much more important where the seasons\r\nare dry than where the lack of rain is but little feared. When the seed\r\nis sown after summerfallow or cultivated crops, it is usually considered\r\npreferable to make the seed-bed without using the plow, but to this\r\nthere may be some exceptions. If sowing is deferred for a few weeks in\r\nthe spring on such lands, or on other lands autumn plowed or early\r\nspring plowed, a free use of the harrow ought to be made in the\r\ninterval, because of the favorable influence which this will have on the\r\nretention of moisture. In preparing some soils for autumn sowing after\r\na grain crop, as in some parts of Nebraska and Kansas, it is only\r\nnecessary to use the harrow; in preparing others the disk and harrow;\r\nand in yet others the disk and harrow and roller. In preparing other\r\nsoils, as the clays of the South, it may be necessary first to plow and\r\nsubsoil, and subsequently to use sufficiently the harrow and roller.\r\n\r\nEvenness in the soil on the surface is important when it is so retentive\r\nthat water may collect in the depressions after heavy rain. In such\r\nplaces the plants are much liable to fail, especially in the early\r\nwinter, or even shortly after they may have begun to grow, if moisture\r\nis excessive. In order to smooth and even the land sufficiently, it may\r\nbe necessary to run over it some form of leveller. This does not mean,\r\nhowever, that it will not be necessary sometimes to plow the land in\r\nridges, or \"lands,\" as they are sometimes called, but it does mean that\r\nthe slope from the center of the lands toward the furrows shall be even\r\nand gradual, in order that an excess of surface water, as in rainy\r\nclimates, shall be carried away by the latter.\r\n\r\nFirmness in the seed-bed is necessary chiefly to prevent too much drying\r\nout near the surface in dry weather, and the holding of too much water\r\nin the spaces between the particles near the surface in wet weather,\r\nfollowed by freezing of the soil. The less deep the stirring of the\r\ncultivated portion when preparing it, the longer the interval between\r\nsuch stirring and the sowing of the seed, and the heavier the pressure\r\nwhen rolling, the more firm will the seed-bed be. The deeper the land\r\nis plowed, therefore, the longer should be the interval before it is\r\nsowed, but ample rainfall will shorten this period. Firmness in the\r\nseed-bed is more important, relatively, in summer or early autumn when\r\nevaporation from the surface soil is the most rapid. On some soils of\r\nthe Middle States which border on the Mississippi, the early sown autumn\r\ncrop will sometimes perish after the plants have grown some distance\r\nabove the ground, because of want of firmness in the soil; hence, in\r\nsuch locations harrowing the surface of the ground thoroughly may\r\nsometimes be a more suitable preparation than plowing and harrowing.\r\n\r\nFriability in the seed-bed is important when the soils are heavy. The\r\ninfluences which promote it are the presence of humus, liberal\r\ncultivation, and sometimes weather influences, as rain and frost. Unless\r\nheavy clay soils are brought into this condition, the roots of the\r\nalfalfa will not be able to penetrate the soil quickly enough or deeply\r\nenough in search of food.\r\n\r\nAs has been intimated, it will not avail to sow alfalfa in soils not\r\nsufficiently drained naturally or otherwise. Usually, good alfalfa soils\r\nhave sufficient drainage naturally, the subsoil being sufficiently open\r\nto admit of the percolation of water down into the subsoil with\r\nsufficient quickness. But good crops of alfalfa may be grown on subsoils\r\nso retentive that underdrainage is necessary to facilitate the escape of\r\nan excess of moisture with sufficient quickness. The question has been\r\nraised as to whether the roots of the plants will be much liable to\r\nenter and choke the drains at the joints between the tiles. While it\r\nwould not be safe to say that this would never happen, it is not likely\r\nto happen, owing to the character of the root growth. Where too much\r\nwater is held near the surface, in climates characterized by alternate\r\nfreezing and thawing in winter, the young plants will certainly be\r\nthrown out through the heaving of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe subsoiling of lands not sufficiently open below will be greatly\r\nhelpful to the growth of alfalfa. This may also be true of lands not\r\nover-retentive naturally, but made so by the treading of the animals for\r\nsuccessive years on the soil under the furrow when plowing the land. In\r\nsome conditions, without subsoiling thus, the growing of alfalfa will\r\nnot be successful, but in doing this work, care should be taken not to\r\nbring up raw subsoil to the surface. In subsoiling for alfalfa, usually\r\nthe more deeply the ground can be stirred by the subsoiler, the better\r\nwill be the results that will follow. Subsoiling is particularly helpful\r\nto the growing of alfalfa on many of the clay soils of the South.\r\n\r\nIn the far West, toward the mountains, and probably within the same, are\r\nareas in which excellent stands of alfalfa may be obtained by simply\r\nsowing the seed on surfaces stirred with a disk or with a heavy harrow\r\nweighted while it is being driven over the land. The implements should\r\nbe driven first one way and then the other, and, of course, the seed is\r\nharrowed after it has been sown. Where the soil is sufficiently level,\r\nthis plan of preparing will prove satisfactory, more especially where\r\nwater can be put upon the land, but it will also succeed frequently in\r\nthe absence of irrigating waters. In some instances the disking and\r\nsowing are both done by the same implement, which is driven both ways\r\nacross the field.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is sometimes sown, and with profit, on steep hill sides which\r\nare inclined to wash. When set on these it tends to prevent the washing\r\nof the land. In such situations it is better to sow with a nurse crop,\r\nwhich will help to hold the soil until the alfalfa becomes rooted. Where\r\nland is so loose as to blow and irrigation cannot be practiced, only as\r\nmuch should be sown each season as can be covered with stable litter and\r\nwell-rotted straw drawn out at the proper season.\r\n\r\n=Sowing.=--The best season for sowing alfalfa will depend upon such\r\nconditions as relate to soil, moisture and climate. On rather stiff clay\r\nsoils, the other conditions being right, the most satisfactory results\r\nare obtained from sowing the seed in the spring, and on land that has\r\nbeen plowed in the autumn and exposed to the mellowing influences of\r\nwinter. But to this there may be some exceptions. On lands so light as\r\nto lift with the wind, that season should be avoided in sowing, if\r\npossible, when lifting winds prevail. Such winds are common in some\r\nlocalities in the spring, and may uncover the seed in some places and\r\nbury it too deeply in others.\r\n\r\nWhere moisture is deficient the seed must be sown at those times when it\r\nis most plentiful. This may be in the autumn, but more commonly it is in\r\nthe quite early spring. In some of the mountain States the best results\r\nhave been obtained under semi-arid conditions from sowing the seed in\r\nthe late autumn, so that it would be ready for germination at the first\r\ncommencement of the period of growth in the spring. Under some\r\nconditions the too dry character of the weather may preclude the sowing\r\nof alfalfa in the summer and autumn months. Where moisture is plentiful\r\nall the season of growth, alfalfa may be sown almost any time, except\r\nthe early spring or late autumn. Where irrigating waters are plentiful,\r\nthe only hindrances to sowing alfalfa at any season of the year are such\r\nas may arise from climate. Far South in very mild areas it may be sown\r\nalmost any time.\r\n\r\nWhere the temperatures are low in winter, the best results are obtained\r\nfrom sowing alfalfa in the spring and early summer, otherwise the plants\r\ndo not become sufficiently well established to withstand the rigors of\r\nthe winter following. Under some conditions, sufficiently satisfactory\r\nresults follow sowing in the early summer, even in Northern latitudes.\r\nWhere the winters are sufficiently mild and the moisture is sufficiently\r\nplentiful, early autumn sowing, as in August or September, according to\r\nthe locality, is, all things considered, the most satisfactory, for the\r\nreason, first, that it follows, or may follow, a crop grown the same\r\nseason; second, that the plants are less hindered in their growth by\r\nweeds when they are young; and third, that they produce crops of soiling\r\nfood or hay the first season after sowing. Many weeds do not grow in\r\nautumn and winter; hence, the less injury done by them to alfalfa\r\nplants, since the latter are so strong by spring that they overshadow\r\nthe weeds in their effort to grow. When alfalfa is sown at such a time,\r\nthe growth of one year virtually is gained by the process.\r\n\r\nNorth of parallel 40 deg., that is, north of the latitude of Columbus, Ohio,\r\nand Denver, Colorado, speaking in a general way, alfalfa is more\r\ncommonly sown in the spring, but not usually so early as clover, lest\r\nthe young plants, which are more tender than clover plants, should be\r\nnipped by spring frosts. This danger is frequently present in the region\r\nof the upper Missouri. East of the Mississippi it may usually be\r\nadvisable to sow in the spring some distance south from the latitude\r\nnamed. West from the same are areas where early autumn sowing is\r\nfrequently the best. In much of the Southern and Southwestern States,\r\nearly autumn sowing is considered better practice than spring sowing,\r\nbut to this there are exceptions. Under some conditions alternate\r\nfreezing and thawing of the land near the surface tend to throw out\r\nyoung plants, as, for instance, those autumn sown, more readily than\r\nplants from spring-sown seed.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is usually sown much the same as medium red clover (see page\r\n75), but there are the following points of difference: 1. Since alfalfa\r\nis more commonly sown in dry areas, it is more important, relatively,\r\nthat the seed shall be buried more uniformly and deeply in the soil in\r\nsuch areas. 2. Since it is liable to be more injured, relatively, by a\r\nnurse crop than the clovers, it is more frequently sown without one.\r\nAnd 3. Since it is expected to furnish food for a much longer term of\r\nyears than any of the clovers, it is relatively more important that the\r\nseed shall be sown with a view to seek a uniform and sufficient stand of\r\nthe plants.\r\n\r\nWhether the seed is sown by hand, or by any of the hand machines in use,\r\nthe results will usually prove satisfactory, but in climates where\r\nmoisture is deficient, decidedly better results are obtained from sowing\r\nthe seed with some form of seed drill. A press drill is preferred in\r\nsoils so light and open as to dry out easily or to lift easily with the\r\nwind. Under conditions of ample moisture, a light covering with a harrow\r\nwill suffice, but under conditions the opposite, more covering is\r\nnecessary. In areas where spring and early autumn showers are frequent,\r\nthe roller will provide a sufficient covering, especially where the\r\nsoils are well charged with a clay content. On other soils, as those\r\nwhich cover much of the prairie, the seed should be buried from 1 to 2\r\ninches deep.\r\n\r\nWhere alfalfa is much sown on soils well supplied with humus, and on the\r\nsoils which prevail in the Rocky Mountain region, many growers sow the\r\nseed with the grain drill, and before sowing they first mix the seed\r\nwith some material, as earth, some kind of coarse meal, bran or other\r\nsubstance to make it feed out more regularly. In some instances one-half\r\nof the seed is sown the first time the drill is driven over the land,\r\nand the balance is sown by driving again over the same at right angles\r\nto the drill marks previously made. When thus sown, the plants are more\r\nevenly distributed over the soil, and produce, it is thought, a more\r\nuniform quality of stalk. This method meets, in part, at least, the\r\nobjection sometimes made to drill sowing, that it does not distribute\r\nthe plants sufficiently in the soil.\r\n\r\nIn the Northern and Atlantic States, also west of the Cascade Mountains,\r\nand in some parts of the South, alfalfa is frequently sown with a nurse\r\ncrop, and under favorable conditions the results are usually\r\nsatisfactory, if the nurse crop is not sown too thickly. The best nurse\r\ncrops in the areas named are barley and winter rye, but oats will answer\r\nalso, if sown thinly and cut for hay. It has also been sown quite\r\nsuccessfully along with winter wheat in the spring and also with spring\r\nwheat. When sown with winter wheat or winter rye, it is usually\r\nadvantageous to cover the seed well with the harrow. In many instances,\r\nhowever, even in these areas, it is thought better to sow the seed\r\nwithout a nurse crop, in order that the plants may have all the benefit\r\nfrom moisture and sunlight which it is possible to give them. This is\r\nspecially desirable when the fear is present that they may succumb the\r\nfirst winter to the severity of the weather. As weeds grow rapidly along\r\nwith the plants, the mower should be run over the field from one to\r\nthree times during the season. If the mowing is done at the proper time,\r\nit will not be necessary to remove what has been cut off by the mower.\r\nIt may be allowed to lie as a mulch on the land. But should the growth\r\nof weeds be excessive before the mowing is done, it would then be\r\nnecessary to remove them, in order to avoid smothering the plants. The\r\nclipping back of the alfalfa plants is helpful, rather than hurtful.\r\nWhen not thus clipped back the leaves frequently assume a yellowish tint\r\non the top of the plants, which gradually extends downward until the\r\ngreater portion of the leaves may be thus affected. Such condition\r\nfrequently betokens a lack of nitrogen, but it may also be induced by\r\nother causes. When it does appear, the mower should at once be used and\r\nalso as often as it appears. As soon as mowed off the plants usually\r\nstool out, sending up fresh shoots more numerously. They thus form a\r\ncrown, somewhat like the crown in clover plants. Root growth is also\r\nstrengthened, and the plants are thus made much stronger for going into\r\nthe winter. Each clipping during the season, of course, cuts down weeds\r\nand prevents them from making seed. If not thus clipped, they would\r\nfrequently injure the crop more by shade and crowding than would a nurse\r\ncrop. The mulch thus made through clipping back the plants is in many\r\ninstances quite helpful to them, because of the check which it gives to\r\nthe escape of ground moisture. There is some difference in the view held\r\nas to whether close clipping is preferable, but the balance of authority\r\nis in favor of reasonably close clipping.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is usually sown alone, but in some instances it maybe\r\nadvantageous to sow more or less of some other kind or kinds of grass or\r\nclover along with it. When grown for hay it is usually preferable to\r\nsow the seed without admixture. But there may be instances in which\r\nmedium red or alsike clover may improve the crop the first year or two\r\nthat it is mown for hay. But where red clover grows much more vigorously\r\nthan alfalfa the first season, it should not be thus sown in any\r\nconsiderable quantities, or the clover plants will injure the alfalfa\r\nplants by crowding and overshading. Nevertheless, alfalfa may frequently\r\nwith profit form a considerable factor in clover grown as pasture.\r\n\r\nWhere the main purpose of sowing alfalfa is to provide pasture, various\r\ngrasses and clovers may be sown along with it, and in varying\r\nquantities, according to the attendant conditions. The choice of the\r\nvariety or varieties to sow along with the alfalfa should be based on\r\nthe needs of the stock to be pastured, and on the degree of the vigor\r\nwith which these grow and maintain themselves in the locality. In the\r\nNorthern States and Eastern Canada timothy and Russian brome grass\r\n(_Bromus inermis_) may be chosen. In areas with Southern Illinois as a\r\ncenter, red top and timothy should be satisfactory. In the Southern\r\nStates, the claims of orchard grass and tall oat grass would probably be\r\nparamount. In areas with Iowa as a center, nothing would be more\r\nsuitable, probably, than Russian brome grass. In the mountain States,\r\nwith Wyoming as a center, timothy and alsike clover would be suitable.\r\nIn the dry upland country in Washington and Oregon, Russian brome grass\r\nor tall oat grass would answer the purpose. In many areas the plan of\r\nsowing clover chiefly with the alfalfa is a good one, providing the\r\nalfalfa is cut for a year or two, and is then grazed, as by that time\r\ngrasses indigenous to the locality, or which grow well in the same, come\r\nin to such an extent as to form a very considerable proportion of the\r\npasture. Blue grass frequently behaves thus in the North, and crab grass\r\nin the South.\r\n\r\nThe amounts of seed to sow will vary with the character of the soil and\r\nclimate, with the use that is to be made of the alfalfa, and with the\r\nmanner in which it is sown. On soils and in climates quite favorable to\r\nthe growth of alfalfa it is common to sow more seed than in those with\r\nless adaptation, and with a view, probably, to check coarseness in the\r\ngrowth of the stems. If sown thinly in such areas, the rank growth which\r\nfollows would be coarse. This explains why in the Western and mountain\r\nStates more seed is usually sown than in the Eastern and Northern\r\nStates. Averaging the whole country, 20 pounds of seed per acre is more\r\nfrequently mentioned as the proper amount to sow than any other\r\nquantity. In the Northern States many growers sow 15 pounds per acre,\r\nand judging by the yield obtained, this amount of seed has proved\r\nsatisfactory. Some growers even mention 10 to 12 pounds as satisfactory.\r\nThe amounts last named are certainly too small for average conditions.\r\nFifteen to 20 pounds may be fixed upon as the proper amounts to sow on\r\nsoil in good condition for speedy germination. But many growers claim\r\nsatisfactory results from sowing larger amounts of seed than those\r\nnamed. Under semi-arid conditions, where irrigation cannot be given, a\r\nmoderate amount of seed will be more satisfactory than very thick\r\nseeding, as when sown too thickly the plants would suffer more from want\r\nof moisture than if sown more thinly. The aim should be to obtain a\r\nstand that will cover the ground evenly and as thickly as will admit of\r\nthe vigorous growing of the plants. Because of the relatively long\r\nduration of the period of the growth of alfalfa fields, it is specially\r\nimportant that good stands shall be obtained at the first, and for the\r\nfurther reason that the plants will then be better able to contend with\r\nintruding weeds, the great bane of alfalfa meadows.\r\n\r\nWhen alfalfa is grown mainly for seed, it should be more thinly sown\r\nthan when it is grown for hay or soiling food. It has been noticed that\r\nwhen the plants stand thickly beyond a certain degree, they do not seed\r\nwell. Twelve to 16 pounds have been mentioned as quite enough to sow for\r\nsuch production in the mountain States. Where both objects are\r\nimportant, medium thick sowing would be the most suitable.\r\n\r\nWhen sown in combinations such as have been named above, it will be\r\nnecessary to modify somewhat the amounts of alfalfa seed sown, according\r\nto the proportion of the other seeds sown with the alfalfa. But since\r\nmany grasses are more aggressive than alfalfa, it is not necessary to\r\nreduce the amount of alfalfa seed sown proportionately to the amounts of\r\nthe other seeds that may be sown along with it. In many instances it may\r\nbe proper not to reduce the amount of the alfalfa seed at all, as some\r\nof these grasses will soon crowd the alfalfa plants, to their injury,\r\neven though the usual amount of seed should be sown. The amount of the\r\ngrasses sown with the alfalfa will, of course, vary. It will seldom be\r\nnecessary in any instance to sow more than 6 or 7 pounds per acre, and\r\nunder many conditions not more than 5 pounds. When alfalfa is sown with\r\ntimothy and clover in temporary meadows or pastures, it is seldom\r\nnecessary to sow more than 3 to 5 pounds per acre, and the same is true\r\nof it when sown in a permanent pasture. The crop is so little grown for\r\nhay in mixtures, that it is scarcely necessary to dwell upon the nature\r\nof these, or the respective amounts of seed to sow in making them.\r\n\r\nWhen alfalfa is sown with the grain, there will be a saving of seed to\r\nthe extent of at least 20 per cent., as compared with broadcast sowing.\r\nThis arises from the more general sprouting of all the seeds, since they\r\nare planted at a more uniform depth, and from the subsequent loss of a\r\nsmaller percentage of the plants through drought, and it may be other\r\ncauses. But when sowing broadcast, it will in many instances prove more\r\nsatisfactory to add 20 per cent. to the amounts mentioned above, as\r\nsuitable for being sown without admixture with other grasses and\r\nclovers, rather than to deduct 20 per cent. from these amounts when\r\nsowing the seed with the drill.\r\n\r\n=Cultivating.=--Under some conditions, it is, in a sense, necessary to\r\nsow alfalfa in rows, and to give it cultivation during the first season\r\nand sometimes for a longer period. In some parts of Florida, for\r\ninstance, the most satisfactory results have been obtained from sowing\r\nin rows with 12 to 24 inches between the rows, and then to cultivate\r\nbetween these as may be necessary to keep down the growth of weeds.\r\nUnder some conditions also in the Atlantic States, the most satisfactory\r\nresults have been obtained from sowing alfalfa in rows 14 to 16 inches\r\napart and cultivating between them. Even hand hoeing the first season\r\nmay be justifiable along the line of the rows for small areas, but with\r\nthe price of labor as at present, would be too costly for large areas.\r\nWhen grown in rows as indicated in the Atlantic States and westward from\r\nthese, the yields of seed have been more satisfactory than when sown\r\nbroadcast, but the crop is less satisfactory for hay, owing to the\r\ncoarse and uneven character of the stems. The amounts of seed wanted for\r\nsuch sowing will, of course, vary chiefly with the distance between the\r\nrows. As small an amount as 6 pounds or even less will in some instances\r\nsuffice per acre.\r\n\r\n=Pasturing.=--The practice of pasturing alfalfa the first season,\r\nespecially where it cannot be irrigated, is usually condemned, lest it\r\nshould weaken the plants unduly for entering the winter. It would seem\r\nprobable, however, that under some conditions such grazing would be\r\nhelpful rather than hurtful. The cropping of the plants by stock, in the\r\ninfluence which it exerts upon the plants, is akin to that which arises\r\nfrom cutting them back frequently during the summer. The animals thus\r\ngrazed will also crop down weeds. This, at least, is true of sheep. The\r\nauthor has succeeded in getting a good stand of alfalfa by sowing seed\r\nat the rate of 15 pounds per acre, along with 2 to 4 pounds of Dwarf\r\nEssex rape seed, and grazing the same with sheep. Other growers, during\r\nrecent years, have succeeded similarly. The grazing should not begin\r\nuntil the plants have made a good start, but it should not be deferred\r\nso long that the rape and the weeds will unduly shade the alfalfa\r\nplants. The pasturing should not be too close, nor should it be so long\r\ncontinued that the alfalfa plants will not be able to provide a good\r\ngrowth in the early autumn before the advent of winter.\r\n\r\nThe management of the spring-sown crop the first season requires careful\r\nattention in areas where the hazard exists in any considerable degree\r\nthat the plants may take serious harm at that season, or, indeed, fail\r\naltogether. In Western areas, from Canada to Kentucky and Missouri, it\r\nis important that the stubbles of the grain shall be cut high, amid\r\nwhich alfalfa grows when it is sown with a nurse crop. When not thus\r\nsown, it is of prime importance that the plants shall stand up several\r\ninches above the surface of the ground before the advent of winter. This\r\nis specially important in States west of the Mississippi River. The\r\nobjects effected are three-fold. First, the snow is arrested and held\r\nfor the protection of the plants, and to furnish them with moisture when\r\nthe snow melts. The extent to which the stubbles and the erect young\r\nalfalfa plants will hold snow is simply surprising. On the exposed\r\nprairies, the snow usually drifts so completely from unprotected lands,\r\nthat during almost any winter a large proportion of the area will be\r\nquite bare. The melting of the snow thus held is also of much value to\r\nthe crop in the moisture which it brings to it, especially in areas\r\nwhere the rainfall is less than normal. Second, the plants are thus\r\nprotected from the sweep of the cold winds which blow so much of the\r\nseason in the unprotected prairie, and which are frequently fatal to\r\nvarious winter crops. Third, they are also protected from the intensity\r\nof the frost, which may in some instances kill young alfalfa plants in\r\nareas northward.\r\n\r\nIn the Northern States east of Minnesota, the New England States, and\r\nthe provinces of Canada east of Lake Huron, the considerable covering on\r\nthe ground is not so important, relatively, to protect the plants\r\nagainst the coming winter, but it is also of considerable importance, as\r\nsometimes the early snows melt so completely that the fields are left\r\nbare in midwinter. The warm temperatures which melt the snow may be\r\nfollowed by a cold wave, which may be greatly injurious to the plants.\r\nThere may be instances, as where the snow usually falls very deeply, in\r\nwhich the covering left would prove excessive, and so tend to smother\r\nthe plants; hence, sometimes it may be necessary to guard against too\r\nmuch covering.\r\n\r\nIf the plants should lack age or vigor on entering the first winter, a\r\ntop-dressing of farmyard manure will render great service in protecting\r\nthem. This, however, is only practicable with comparatively limited\r\nareas. It is sometimes practiced in the North Atlantic States, where\r\nthe manure thus applied will prove greatly helpful to the growth of the\r\nalfalfa during the following season. These precautions to guard against\r\nthe severity of winter weather are not nearly so necessary in the Rocky\r\nMountain States where irrigation is practiced. In these, alfalfa spring\r\nsown is sometimes pastured during the following winter, and without any\r\ngreat harm to the crop. Thus greatly do conditions vary.\r\n\r\nIt may also be well to remember that where rainfall is usually plentiful\r\nand sometimes excessive, that a better stand of the young plants can be\r\nobtained when the rainfall is moderate than when it is copious.\r\nSaturated ground is hurtful to the young plants. They will not grow\r\nproperly under such conditions and are likely to assume a sickly\r\nappearance. Mildew may appear and the plants may fail in patches. And\r\nthis may happen on land which will ordinarily produce reasonably good\r\ncrops of alfalfa after they have once been established.\r\n\r\nThe value of alfalfa in providing pasture is more restricted than in\r\nproviding hay. This arises in part from the injury which may come to the\r\nplants from grazing too closely at certain times, and in a greater\r\ndegree from injury which may result to certain animals which may feed\r\nupon the plants, more especially cattle and sheep, through bloating, to\r\nwhich it frequently gives rise.\r\n\r\nThis plant is pre-eminently a pasture for swine. They may be grazed upon\r\nit with profit all the season, from spring until fall. No plant now\r\ngrown in the United States will furnish so much grazing from a given\r\narea in localities well adapted to its growth. Swine are very fond of\r\nit. Some growers do not feed any grain supplement to their swine when\r\ngrazing on alfalfa, but it is generally believed that, under average\r\nconditions, it is wise to supplement the alfalfa pasture daily with a\r\nlight feed of grain, carbonaceous in character, as of rye, corn or\r\nbarley, and that this should be gradually increased with the advancement\r\nof the grazing season. One acre of alfalfa will provide pasture for 5 to\r\n15 head of swine, through all the grazing season, dependent upon the\r\ndegree of the favorable character of the conditions for growth in the\r\nalfalfa, the age of the swine, and the extent to which the pasture is\r\nsupplemented with grain. But in some instances the area named will graze\r\nat least 15 hogs through all the growing season without a grain\r\nsupplement.\r\n\r\nSwine may be turned in to graze on alfalfa when well set, as soon as it\r\nbegins to grow freely in the spring. It should be so managed that the\r\ngrazing will be kept reasonably tender and succulent. For swine pasture\r\nthe plants should never be allowed to reach the blossoming stage. This\r\ncan be managed by running the field mower over the pasture occasionally\r\nwhen the stems are growing long and coarse. Close and prolonged grazing\r\nby swine will tend to shorten the period of the life of the alfalfa. The\r\nextent to which this result will follow will depend upon soil and\r\nclimatic conditions and the closeness of the grazing. To avoid such a\r\nresult and also to secure the utilization of the food to the utmost,\r\nsome growers advocate cutting the alfalfa and feeding it to swine as\r\nsoiling. The advisability of handling it thus will be dependent to some\r\nextent on the relative price of labor.\r\n\r\nThe best results, relatively, from growing alfalfa to provide pasture\r\nwill be found in the Western valleys, where alfalfa grows with much\r\nvigor, and in certain areas of the South, where it grows freely and can\r\nbe pastured during much of the year. In areas eminently adapted to the\r\ngrowth of clover, it is not so necessary to grow alfalfa for such a use.\r\nIn Western areas, where Canada field peas are a success, and especially\r\nwhere artichokes are not hidden from swine by frost, pork can be grown\r\nvery cheaply, and without the necessity of harvesting any very large\r\nportion of these crops, except through grazing them down by swine.\r\n\r\nSuch conditions would be highly favorable to the maintenance of health\r\nin the swine, and the quality of the pork made would be of the best. In\r\nsome instances a small stack of Canada field peas is put up in the swine\r\npasture that the swine may help themselves from the same the following\r\nyear, as in rainless or nearly rainless climates, where such grain will\r\nkeep long without injury.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa furnishes excellent grazing for horses, more especially when\r\nthey are not at work. Like other succulent pastures, it tends too much\r\nto induce laxness in the bowels with horses which graze it, without any\r\ndry fodder supplement. But it has high adaptation for providing pasture\r\nfor brood mares, colts, and horses that are idle or working but little.\r\nWhile it induces abundant milk production in brood mares, and induces\r\nquick and large growth in colts until matured, it is thought by some\r\npractical horsemen that horses grown chiefly on alfalfa have not the\r\nstaying power and endurance of those, for instance, that are grazed\r\nchiefly on Kentucky blue grass and some other grasses. There is probably\r\nsome truth in the surmise, and if so, the objection raised could be met\r\nby dividing the grazing either through alternating the same with other\r\npastures or by growing some other grass or grasses along with the\r\nalfalfa.\r\n\r\nThe alfalfa furnishes excellent grazing for cattle, whether they are\r\ngrown as stockers, are kept for milk producing, or are being fattened\r\nfor beef. For the two purposes first named it has high excellence, and\r\nit will also produce good beef, but alfalfa grazing alone will not\r\nfinish animals for the block quite so well without a grain supplement as\r\nwith one. But the danger is usually present to a greater or less degree\r\nthat cattle thus grazed may suffer from bloat, induced by eating the\r\ngreen alfalfa. This danger increases with the humidity of the\r\natmosphere, with the succulence of the alfalfa, and with the degree of\r\nthe moisture resting on it, as from dew or rain. This explains why in\r\nsome sections the losses from this source are much greater than in\r\nothers. It also explains why such losses are greater in some areas than\r\nin others. It is considered that grazing alfalfa with cattle in the\r\nmountain valleys is less hazardous than in areas East and Southeast, as\r\nthe atmosphere is less humid, the danger from the succulence can be\r\nbetter controlled by the amount of irrigating water supplied, and\r\nbecause of the infrequency of the rainfall. Nevertheless, the losses\r\nfrom bloat are sometimes severe in both cattle and sheep in the mountain\r\nStates, notwithstanding that some seasons large herds are grazed upon\r\nalfalfa through the entire season without any loss.\r\n\r\nCattle grazed upon alfalfa may be so managed that the extent of this\r\nhazard will be very much lessened, if not entirely obviated, but with\r\nlarge herds some of the precautionary methods now to be submitted may\r\nnot always be practicable. They should never be turned in to graze upon\r\nalfalfa when hungry. Some grazers adopt the plan of leaving them on the\r\ngrazing continuously when once put in to graze. Others leave them in for\r\na limited time each day at the first, increasing the duration of the\r\npasturing period from day to day. After managing them thus for a week or\r\ntwo, the animals are only removed from the pasture for such purposes as\r\nmilking. Others, again, feed some alfalfa or other food in the morning\r\nbefore turning them on to alfalfa pastures. Another plan adopted is to\r\ngraze them on a field of other grazing, located, if possible, beside the\r\nalfalfa field, until after the dew has lifted, and then to open the gate\r\ninto the alfalfa pasture. This is readily practicable with a herd of\r\ncows, but not to anything like the same extent with a large herd being\r\ngrown for beef.\r\n\r\nThe danger from bloat in pasturing sheep upon alfalfa is at least as\r\ngreat as in pasturing cattle on the same, and the methods of managing\r\nthem while thus being grazed are not far different. So, too, the\r\nexperiences in such grazing are very similar. The losses from such\r\ngrazing some seasons have been slight. Other seasons they have proved so\r\nheavy as to make such grazing unprofitable. When sheep are being grazed\r\non alfalfa, a light feed of grain given in the early morning reduces\r\nmaterially the danger from bloat. It also enables the flock-master to\r\nfinish his sheep or lambs for the market cheaply and in fine form, since\r\nthis small grain factor, not necessarily more than half a pound a day,\r\nwhether given as wheat, rye, barley, oats or corn, puts the ration\r\npractically in balance for the purpose named, and it may be given to the\r\nsheep daily in troughs without taking them out of the pasture.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that there is more danger to cattle and sheep from grazing\r\non alfalfa than on any of the clovers, and probably such is the case.\r\nBut whether this is true or not, the danger is very considerable, and is\r\nenhanced by the presence of frost as well as the presence of moisture,\r\nfrom much succulence in the plants, from rain and from dew. So great is\r\nthe danger that the inexperienced should proceed with much caution in\r\nsuch grazing. When bloat does occur, the method of dealing with it is\r\ngiven on page 95.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to produce bloat in alfalfa pastures decreases with the\r\nextent to which other grasses are present in the pastures. Should\r\nalfalfa be grown, therefore, for the purpose of providing pasture, some\r\nother grass or grasses should be sown along with it. Which of these\r\nshould be thus sown ought to depend chiefly on the adaptation of the\r\ngrasses for producing vigorous growth under the conditions present. In\r\nthe States east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio, and in all of\r\nCanada east from Lake Huron, alfalfa may be made an important feature in\r\npastures variously composed. For instance, on suitable soils alfalfa may\r\nbe made an important feature in pastures composed otherwise of medium\r\nred and alsike clover and timothy. The author can speak from experience\r\nas to the slightness of the danger from grazing cattle and sheep on such\r\npastures. In the Southern States tall oat grass could be sown with the\r\nalfalfa, and probably orchard grass. In some areas alfalfa will maintain\r\nits hold on lands smitten with Johnson grass, both producing freely. In\r\nmuch of Kansas meadow fescue would answer the purpose, northward brome\r\ngrass would probably answer, and in some places timothy. In Idaho and\r\nthe States adjoining, tall oat grass, meadow fescue and orchard grass\r\nwill all be helpful, and in some of the mountain States it has been\r\nfound that when alsike clover is grown freely in alfalfa pastures, the\r\ntendency to bloat is not only lessened in the animals grazing, but the\r\nvalue of the pasture, especially for winter grazing, is greatly\r\nimproved. Some grazers, especially in the mountain States, have adopted\r\nthe plan of sowing other pastures, as wheat or barley, beside the\r\nalfalfa pastures, and these are made accessible at will to the animals\r\nthat are being grazed. The plan has some commendable features, but\r\ngrazing animals thus does not reduce the danger as much as when they are\r\ngrazed on pastures in which other grasses grow up amid alfalfa. In some\r\nof the Western States pure alfalfa meadows are grazed through successive\r\nseasons with but little loss, but in such instances the grazing began in\r\nthe spring and was continuous. Judicious care should be exercised in\r\ngrazing alfalfa lest the stand of the plants shall be injured. The\r\nliability to injury in the plants from injudicious grazing increases\r\nwith the lack of adaptation in the soil and climate for abundant and\r\nprolonged growth in the alfalfa.\r\n\r\nIn a large majority of instances, as previously intimated, it is not\r\nwise to graze down alfalfa at all closely the season of sowing, and in\r\nsome instances it should not then be grazed to any extent, lest the\r\nplants be unduly weakened for entering the winter. In cold areas the\r\nhazard is much greater from such grazing than in those that are mild,\r\nand likewise, it is greater when the growth is only moderately vigorous\r\nthan in areas where alfalfa grows with the vigor of a weed, as in\r\nWestern mountain valleys. In areas where the winters are cold, and\r\nespecially where the snowfall is light and the winds have a wide sweep,\r\nthe animals which graze upon alfalfa should be removed in time to allow\r\nthe plants to grow up to the height of several inches before the advent\r\nof winter. The growth thus secured will catch and hold the snow, and the\r\nprotection thus furnished is greatly helpful to the preservation and\r\nvigor of the plants. Experience has shown that in Northern areas\r\npasturing alfalfa in winter, especially when the ground is bare and\r\nfrozen, brings imminent hazard to the plants. On the other hand, grazing\r\nin winter in the mountain valleys, when as far north as Central\r\nMontana, may be practiced with little or no hazard to the stand of\r\nplants when these have become well established. In such areas alfalfa\r\nmay be grazed practically as may be desired, providing this grazing is\r\nnot too close.\r\n\r\nCattle injure alfalfa less than other animals when they graze upon it,\r\nas they do not crop it too closely; swine injure it more, if the grazing\r\nis constant. Horses do even greater injury, through biting the crowns of\r\nthe plants too closely; but sheep injure alfalfa pastures more than any\r\nof these animals, when the grazing is close, owing to the extent to\r\nwhich they trim off the leaves.\r\n\r\n=As Soiling Food.=--For being fed as soiling food, alfalfa has the very\r\nhighest adaptation, owing, 1. To the long period covered by the growth.\r\n2. To the rapidity of the growth resulting in large relative production.\r\n3. To the palatability of the green food produced. 4. To the entire\r\nsafety to the animals fed. And 5. To its high feeding value. In\r\nLouisiana, for instance, alfalfa may be made to furnish soiling food for\r\nnine months in the year. In the North, of course, the duration of\r\nproduction is much less, but it is seldom less than five months. The\r\ngrowth is so rapid that cuttings for soiling food may usually be made at\r\nintervals of four to six weeks, according to season and climate; hence,\r\nthe cuttings for soiling food will run all the way from two to eight or\r\nnine each season. It is so palatable that horses, mules, cattle, sheep\r\nand swine relish it highly. When wilted a little before being fed, the\r\ndanger of producing bloat is eliminated. Its feeding value is nearly\r\nthe same as that of the medium red clover, thus making it in itself what\r\nmay be termed a balanced or perfect food for horses, mules, cattle and\r\nsheep until development is completed and subsequently when they are at\r\nrest; that is, when they are not producing, as in the form of labor or\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nThe highest use, probably, from feeding alfalfa when green will arise\r\nfrom feeding it to milch cows. Its high protein content in combination\r\nwith its succulence pre-eminently adapts it to such a use. Wherever\r\nalfalfa can be grown and will produce even two cuttings a year, it will\r\nserve a good purpose in producing milk. Every dairyman dependent more or\r\nless on soiling food will find it to his advantage to grow alfalfa where\r\nit may be grown in good form. When fed to milch cows, some meal added,\r\ncarbonaceous in character, as corn or non-saccharine sorghum seed, may\r\nprove a paying investment, and it may also be advisable to alternate the\r\ngreen alfalfa, morning or evening, with such other green crops as oats\r\nand peas, millet, rape, corn or sorghum when in season, to provide\r\nvariety. But even though alfalfa alone should be thus made to supplement\r\nthe pastures, the outcome should be at least fairly satisfactory. When\r\nfed to horses that are working, some care must be exercised in feeding\r\nit, lest too lax a condition of the bowels should be induced, and a\r\ngrain factor should be fed at the same time. It has frequently been\r\ngiven to sheep that were being fitted for show purposes, but may also be\r\nfed green to the entire flock, with a view to supplement the pastures.\r\nIt has special adaptation for promoting large growth in lambs, and,\r\nindeed, in any kind of young stock to which it may be fed. When fed to\r\nswine, a small grain supplement properly chosen and fed will insure more\r\nsatisfactory growth. It is thought that more satisfactory results will\r\nbe obtained from allowing the alfalfa to get fairly well on toward the\r\nblossoming stage before beginning to feed, and to continue to feed until\r\nin full bloom. This in practice may not always be possible, but usually\r\nan approximation to it may be reached, especially when the production of\r\nthe alfalfa will more than supply the needs in soiling food. The ideal\r\nplan is to commence cutting the alfalfa as soon as a good growth is\r\nmade, cutting enough daily or every other day to supply the needs of the\r\nanimals. If the growth becomes too much advanced before the field is\r\ngone over thus, the balance should be made into hay, and the cutting\r\nshould begin again where it began previously.\r\n\r\nThere is no question but that considerably more food can be obtained\r\nfrom a given area when green alfalfa is fed in the soiling form, instead\r\nof being grazed. The difference in such production would not be easy to\r\ndetermine, but of the fact stated there cannot be any doubt. Ordinarily,\r\neach cutting of green alfalfa for soiling should not produce less than 4\r\ntons; hence, where 8 cuttings can be secured, not fewer than 32 tons of\r\nsoiling food could be obtained per season. But whether the increase from\r\nsoiling alfalfa, as compared with pasturing the same, would repay the\r\ncost of the extra labor, will depend upon conditions that vary with time\r\nand place. Alfalfa fields thus managed or cut for hay will also produce\r\nfor a longer period than when the fields are grazed.\r\n\r\nContinuity in the production of soiling food may not be possible some\r\nseasons in the absence of irrigation; hence, under such conditions\r\nprovision should always be made for a supply of such other soiling foods\r\nas may be needed, and of a character that will make it practical to turn\r\nthem into dry fodder when not wanted as soiling food. But where\r\nirrigating waters are unfailing, it is quite possible to furnish soiling\r\nfood from alfalfa soils through practically all the growing season.\r\nDairymen thus located are in a dairyman's paradise.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa, like clover, may be made into silage. In dry climates this\r\nwould seem to be unnecessary, but in rainy climates it may be wise in\r\nsome instances to make alfalfa ensilage, the better to insure the curing\r\nof the crop. What has been said with reference to clover ensilage will\r\napply almost equally to alfalfa. (See page 103.) It would be more\r\ndesirable, usually, to make the first cutting from alfalfa into ensilage\r\nthan later cuttings, because of the showery character of the weather at\r\nthat season, but the strong objection stands in the way of doing so,\r\nthat no carbonaceous food, as corn, sorghum or soy beans, is ready for\r\ngoing into the silo then as they are later, with a view of aiding in the\r\nbetter preservation of the ensilage and of making a better balanced\r\nration. Good alfalfa silage is more easily made when the alfalfa has\r\nbeen run through a cutting-box than when in the uncut forms.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting for Hay.=--The best time to harvest alfalfa for hay is just\r\nafter the blossoms begin to appear. Ordinarily, not more than one-third\r\nof the blossoms are out when the harvesting should begin, but when the\r\nhay is to be fed to horses the cutting may be deferred until more than\r\nhalf the blooms are out. If cut earlier, the loss of weight in the crop\r\nwill be considerable, as much as 30 to 45 per cent., as compared with\r\ncutting when in full bloom. If cut later, the stems become over-woody,\r\nand the loss of leaves in curing will be much greater. When the cutting\r\nis delayed beyond the period of early bloom, the growth of the next\r\ncutting is retarded, and when it is deferred until some of the leaves\r\nturn yellow or until some seed is formed, in many situations the\r\ninfluence on the succeeding crop is seriously adverse, and in some\r\ninstances this influence would seem to react against the vigorous growth\r\nof the plant during the remainder of the season. In other instances, as\r\nwhere the conditions are quite favorable to the growth of the plant,\r\nthese results are not present in so marked a degree. When large areas of\r\nalfalfa are to be harvested, the importance of beginning early cannot\r\neasily be overestimated. It would be much better to sacrifice something\r\nin loss of weight in the hay, through cutting too early, than to meet\r\nwith greater loss in weight in the next crop or crops by cutting too\r\nlong deferred.\r\n\r\nMuch that has been said about the harvesting of medium, red clover\r\nwill apply equally to alfalfa. (See page 95.) The mowing should begin as\r\nsoon as the dew has lifted in the morning. The tedder should follow\r\nafter the hay has wilted somewhat, and later, the horse rake, the aim\r\nbeing to get the crop made into winrows, preferably small, before\r\nnightfall, and when the weather is uncertain, the aim should be also to\r\nput the hay up into small cocks the same evening. This may not always be\r\npracticable. If the loss of leaves is likely to be considerable when\r\nraking the hay, raking should be deferred until the influence of evening\r\ndews begins to be felt. After the hay has become wilted it should not be\r\nstirred or handled any more than is really necessary, that loss of\r\nleaves and of the tips of the stems and branches may be avoided, and the\r\nhandling during the curing process should be done to the greatest extent\r\npracticable before or after the sunshine has waxed strong. In showery\r\nweather, when small areas are being harvested, hay caps can be used with\r\nprofit. Where large areas are to be harvested and where there is no\r\ndanger of rain, the crop when nicely wilted is drawn into winrows, and\r\nin these the curing is completed without further stirring or handling.\r\nFrom the winrows it is drawn usually on rakes of a certain make, and the\r\nrake loads thus slid over the ground are lifted bodily onto the stack by\r\nthe use of the \"rickers.\" (See page 100.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Field of Alfalfa in California]\r\n\r\n=Storing.=--When cured in cocks, these are preferably made small to\r\nfacilitate quick curing, but usually from two to four days are necessary\r\nto complete the curing. If the cocks require opening out before being\r\ndrawn, the work should be done with care. Ordinary stacking and storing\r\nmay be done in practically the same way as in handling medium red\r\nclover, and the same care is necessary in protecting the stacks. In\r\nareas where considerable rain falls in the autumn, hay sheds will prove\r\na great convenience in storing alfalfa in the absence of better\r\nfacilities. In the Eastern States alfalfa is sometimes stored in mows\r\nundercured, by putting it into the mow in alternate layers with straw.\r\nThe straw not only aids in preserving the alfalfa in good condition, but\r\nthe alfalfa imparts an aroma to the straw which induces live stock to\r\neat it readily. In showery weather this method of curing alfalfa merits\r\ncareful attention where straw can be had near at hand and in sufficient\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nThe method is sometimes adopted of cutting alfalfa even for hay by using\r\nthe self-rake reaper. The sheaves thus made are allowed to lie on the\r\nground undisturbed until they are ready for being drawn. By this method\r\nof cutting, the loss of leaves is almost entirely avoided, but there are\r\nthese objections to it: that it exposes unduly to sunlight during the\r\ncuring process, and in case of rain the sheaves are easily saturated and\r\ndo not dry readily unless turned over.\r\n\r\nRain falling on alfalfa will injure it quite as much as it does red\r\nclover. (See page 96.) In climates with much rainfall in May or June,\r\nwhen the first cutting of alfalfa is ready for being harvested,\r\naccording to locality, in instances not a few much difficulty is found\r\nin curing alfalfa without loss. Sometimes the entire cutting will be\r\nrendered practically useless by rain. Because of this, as previously\r\nintimated, it may be well to arrange, where practicable, to cut the\r\nfirst crop of the season for soiling food.\r\n\r\nThe number of cuttings during the year depends on such conditions as\r\nrelate to the length of the season, the character of the soil, the\r\nabundance of moisture present, and the use to which the alfalfa is put.\r\nIn some of the river bottoms southward in the Rocky Mountains, where\r\nirrigating waters are plentiful, it is claimed that alfalfa may be made\r\nto furnish one cutting for soiling food every month in the year. Even in\r\nthe Northern western valleys, as many as five or six cuttings for the\r\nuse named may be obtained. North from the Ohio and Potomac rivers three\r\nto five cuttings of soiling food may be looked for each season, and\r\nsouth of these rivers even a larger number. North of the same rivers the\r\nhay crops run from two to four, and southward from the same they are\r\nseldom less than three. In the western valleys they range from three to\r\nfive or six, according to location. In States bordering on the semi-arid\r\nStates eastward and some distance south of the Canadian boundary, from\r\nthree to four cuttings may usually be expected. In Colorado and States\r\nnorth and south from the same, two good crops of alfalfa may be cut from\r\nspring-sown seed the same season, but where irrigation is not practiced\r\nit is seldom that one crop of hay is harvested under similar conditions\r\nof sowing. But in the semi-arid belt not more than one cutting is\r\nusually obtained each season in the absence of water. But the number of\r\ncuttings will be reduced when one of these is a seed crop. When a seed\r\ncrop is taken, the vitality of the plants is apparently so much reduced\r\nfor the season that the subsequent growth is much less vigorous than if\r\nseed had not been thus taken.\r\n\r\nThe yield of hay from each cutting will, of course, vary much with\r\nconditions, but it is seldom less than a ton. An approximate average\r\nwould place the average cutting at about 1-1/4 tons, but as much as 2\r\ntons have been obtained per acre at a cutting, and, again, not more than\r\n1/2 ton. In New Jersey an average of 4.57 tons per acre was obtained\r\nunder good conditions of management, but without irrigation, at the\r\nexperiment station for three years in succession. In Kansas, 4 to 6 tons\r\nper acre may usually be expected from good soils. In Tulare County,\r\nCalifornia, as much as 6 to 10 tons have been secured under irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe yields from the various cuttings are by no means uniform, especially\r\nin the absence of irrigation. They are much influenced by rainfall. In\r\nsuch areas, the second cutting is usually the best for the season, the\r\nsubsequent cuttings being considerably less. Where irrigation is\r\npracticed, the crops are much more uniform, but even in mild climates,\r\nas the season advances, there is a tendency to lesser yields, indicative\r\nof the necessity of at least partial rest for plants during a portion of\r\nthe year. The yields of alfalfa are usually exceeded by those of no\r\nother crop, where the conditions are quite favorable to its growth, even\r\nin the absence of irrigation. At the New Jersey Experiment Station, as\r\nstated in Bulletin No. 148, one acre of alfalfa produced 36,540 pounds\r\nof green food; of corn, 24,000; of red clover, 14,000; of crimson\r\nclover, 14,000; of millet, 16,000; of cow peas, 16,000; and of oats and\r\npeas, 14,000 pounds. But where only two, or even three, cuttings can be\r\nobtained per year, some crops may produce larger yields than alfalfa. In\r\nthe distinctive alfalfa belt in the West, no forage crop can be grown\r\nthat will compare with it in the yields obtained. The protein in alfalfa\r\nis also relatively high. At the station quoted above it was found one\r\nton of alfalfa contained 265 pounds of protein; hence, its high relative\r\nvalue as a food; red clover, 246 pounds; timothy, 118 pounds; and wheat\r\nbran, 118 pounds. At the Delaware Experiment Station, in Bulletin No.\r\n55, it is stated that maximum crops of cow peas and of crimson clover\r\ngave 720 pounds of protein, while a maximum crop of alfalfa gave 1230\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nWhere alfalfa is irrigated, it is usual to apply irrigating waters just\r\nafter each cutting of the crop. It is a matter of some importance that\r\nthe water shall be applied at once as soon as the previous crop has been\r\nharvested, otherwise time will be lost in growing the next crop. There\r\nare instances where it is necessary to apply water before the first crop\r\nis grown, but usually the moisture which falls in the winter and spring\r\nwill suffice to produce the first crop of the season. Some irrigators\r\napply water some time previous to harvesting the crop, but not so late\r\nas to leave the ground in a soft condition when mowing is begun. The\r\namount of water required will vary with the soil, the season of the\r\nyear, the distance of the ground water from the surface, and the\r\nprecipitation. The more porous the soil and subsoil, the hotter the\r\nweather, the less the precipitation and the farther below the surface,\r\nup to a certain limit, the greater will be the amount of water needed.\r\nThere are situations, as in some of the islands in the Yellowstone\r\nRiver, in which ground water is so near the surface that alfalfa grown\r\non these is able to get enough of water from this subterranean source to\r\nproduce good crops. Care should be taken not to apply water in excess of\r\nthe needs of the crop, or the yields will be proportionately reduced.\r\nThe amounts that will best serve the end sought can only be ascertained\r\nby actual test. Caution is also necessary where the winters are cold not\r\nto apply water late or in excessive quantities, lest a sappy condition\r\nof the plants shall be induced, which will make them succumb to the cold\r\nof the winter following. Moreover, on some soils alfalfa fields will\r\nproduce good crops, if irrigated only the first season, until the roots\r\nget down to moisture, the irrigating waters being utilized when more\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa hay is fed freely to all kinds of domestic animals on the farm,\r\nand with results that should prove highly satisfactory. Properly fed, it\r\nis an excellent food for horses and mules. It not only serves to\r\nmaintain flesh, but it is favorable to glossiness in the coat. Horses\r\nthat are working hard should be accustomed to it gradually. When it is\r\nfed to them too freely at the first, it induces too much of a laxity in\r\nthe bowels, too free urination, and profuse sweating. When fed to such\r\nhorses or mules, some authorities claim that several weeks should be\r\ncovered in getting them on to what is termed a \"full feed\" of alfalfa.\r\nWhen fed to milch cows, free lactation results. Alfalfa fine in\r\ncharacter is now manufactured into food suitable for calves and other\r\nyoung stock. Cattle and sheep are now fattened for slaughter on alfalfa\r\nhay fed alone, but when thus fattened the finish made is not equal to\r\nthat resulting from adding grain to the alfalfa. To meet the needs of\r\nthe best markets, alfalfa alone does not produce enough of fat or of\r\nfirmness in the flesh, but it has been claimed, and probably it is true,\r\nthat one-half the amount of grain required for finishing along with\r\ncarbonaceous fodder, such as corn stalks or timothy, will give equally\r\ngood and quick increase when fed with alfalfa hay. It is most excellent\r\nfodder on which to grow cattle and sheep, even in the absence of a grain\r\nsupplement. The later cuttings of the season are thought to be the most\r\nsuitable for calves and also for sheep and lambs, because of the greater\r\nfineness of the fodder and the greater abundance of leaves on it.\r\nAlfalfa hay is used with much advantage in wintering swine, especially\r\nbrood sows. Swine have been wintered on alfalfa hay without any grain\r\nsupplement where the winters are mild, but they will fare much better\r\nwith a grain supplement. It is thought that half the usual amount of\r\ngrain fed will produce equal results when fed with alfalfa, to those\r\nobtained from feeding a full allowance of grain in its absence. Alfalfa\r\nand sorghum properly grown make an excellent food for swine, and the two\r\nmay be profitably fed thus where the conditions may be over-dry for\r\ncorn, but not for sorghum. When feeding alfalfa, the aim should be to\r\nuse it in conjunction with a carbonaceous food, as corn. Fortunate is\r\nthe country which grows good crops of corn and alfalfa.\r\n\r\n=Securing Seed.=--Localities differ much in their capacity to produce\r\nalfalfa seed. The best crops of seed are now grown west and southwest of\r\nthe Mississippi River. Certain areas in the semi-arid country east of\r\nand between the ranges of the Western mountains seem to have special\r\nadaptation for growing seed. At the present time the greatest\r\nseed-producing States are Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and\r\nCalifornia. But in some areas east of that river paying crops can be\r\ngrown. It has also been noticed that when the crop is sown less thickly\r\nthan it is usually sown for hay, the plants seed more freely, when sown\r\nwith sufficient distance between the rows to admit of cultivating the\r\ncrop, and when such cultivation is given, the influence on seed\r\nproduction is also markedly favorable; such treatment given to the\r\nvarieties of recent introduction may possibly result in the production\r\nof seed from the same, notwithstanding that they bear seed very shyly\r\nwhen grown in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nNearly all the seed now grown in the United States is produced by fields\r\nthat have been sown in the usual way, and primarily to produce hay, but\r\nin some areas, especially where irrigation is practiced, it is\r\nsometimes grown mainly for seed. On the irrigated lands of the West it\r\nis customary to grow the first cutting of the season for hay and the\r\nsecond for seed. But in many instances the second cutting also is made\r\ninto hay, and the seed is taken from the third cutting; even in the\r\nStates east of the Mississippi, and also in Ontario and Quebec, seed is\r\nusually taken from the second cutting. But in Montana, Washington and\r\nIdaho, on the higher altitudes, seed is not unfrequently taken from the\r\nfirst cutting for the season, since, in the short season for growth of\r\nthose uplands, seed from cuttings later than the first does not always\r\nmature so well. In a large majority of instances seed does not form so\r\nprofusely from plants of the first cutting as from those of later\r\ngrowths. This is thought to arise, in part, at least, from the fact that\r\nbees, and it may be other insects, are then less active in searching for\r\nfood, and because of this do not aid in the fertilization of the plants\r\nas they do later. Nor does seed of the first cutting ripen so evenly. An\r\nimportant justification is also found for taking seed from the later\r\ncuttings, in the fact that when a crop has produced seed, it grows less\r\nvigorously during the subsequent period of growth that same season. So\r\npronounced is this habit of growth in alfalfa, that in many localities,\r\nif the first growth is allowed to produce seed, but little subsequent\r\ngrowth will be made again the same season. The second cutting, all\r\nthings considered, is the most favorable to seed production, as, unless\r\non irrigated lands, the third cutting is not usually possessed of that\r\nvigor necessary to induce abundant seeding in the plants.\r\n\r\nThe yields of seed are also much influenced by moisture. An excess of\r\nmoisture is more unfavorable to the production of seed than a shortage\r\nin the same. Hence, in areas where the rainfall for the season is very\r\nabundant, but little seed will be produced. Where irrigation is\r\npracticed, the excessive application of water would have a similar\r\neffect, though less pronounced in degree; hence, the apportionment of\r\nthe water to the prospective needs of the seed crop calls for careful\r\nadjustment. Where the first crop is grown for seed, where irrigation is\r\npracticed, in many instances no water is applied until after the seed\r\ncrop has been harvested.\r\n\r\nThe seed is ready for being harvested when a majority of the seed-pods\r\nassume a dark brown tint. The pods of later formation will still possess\r\na yellow tint, and some of them may still possess the green color. These\r\ndo not produce seed nearly equal in quality to the pods which ripen\r\nearlier. To wait for all the later maturing pods to ripen before\r\nharvesting the crop would mean the loss of much of the best seed through\r\nshattering. Another test of maturity is made by shelling the pods in the\r\nhand. When the seed can be thus shelled in a majority of the pods in a\r\nsingle plant, it is ready for being harvested. Alfalfa seed shatters\r\neasily; hence, it is important to harvest the seed crop with promptness\r\nwhen it is ready, to handle it with due carefulness, and in some\r\ninstances to refrain from handling during the hottest hours of\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nThe seed crop is sometimes cut with the mower and raked into winrows,\r\nand in some instances put up into cocks. When it is handled thus, the\r\naim should be to do the work, as far as this may be practicable, in the\r\nearly and late hours of the day, but not, of course, while much dew is\r\non the crop. Sometimes the seed is drawn from the winrows to the\r\nthresher; in other instances from the cocks, and in yet other instances\r\nit is stacked before being threshed, a work that calls for the exercise\r\nof much care in the storing of the crop, lest the seed should be injured\r\nby heating in the stack. This method of harvesting is usually attended\r\nwith much loss of seed.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no better way of harvesting alfalfa than to cut it\r\nwith the self-rake reaper or the binder. The loose sheaves dry quickly,\r\nand when lifted, the aim is to carry them directly to the thresher. Less\r\nseed, it is considered, will be lost in this way than by the other mode\r\nof harvesting given above, and the work is more expeditiously done. But\r\nowing to the difficulty in securing a thresher to thresh the seed, it is\r\nsometimes found necessary to stack the crop, but in areas where\r\nirrigation is practiced such stacking is seldom necessary.\r\n\r\nThe seed is frequently threshed with the ordinary threshing machine, but\r\nin many instances it is also threshed with a clover huller. The huller\r\ndoes the work less quickly, but probably, on the whole, more perfectly.\r\nThreshing machines, with or even without certain adjustments in the\r\narrangement of the teeth in the cylinder and concave, and with extra\r\nscreens, are now doing the work with much despatch, and with a fair\r\nmeasure of satisfaction. But the opinion is held by competent judges\r\nthat a machine that would more completely combine the qualities of the\r\nthresher and the huller would be still more satisfactory. It is easily\r\npossible to have the crop too dry to thresh in the best condition, and\r\ncare should be taken to regulate the feed in threshing so that the\r\nalfalfa will not enter the cylinder in bunches. More than 200 bushels of\r\nseed have been threshed in a day from crops which yielded abundantly.\r\nThe seed should be carefully winnowed before putting it on the market.\r\nThe seed crops, as would naturally be expected, vary much; crops are\r\nharvested which run all the way from 1 to 20 bushels per acre. From\r\nirrigated lands the yields are, of course, much more uniform than from\r\nunirrigated lands, since in the former the supply of moisture may be\r\ncontrolled. Fair to good average yields on these may be stated at from 4\r\nto 6 bushels, good yields at from 6 to 8 bushels per acre, and specially\r\ngood yields at from 10 to 12 bushels. The bushel weighs 60 pounds.\r\nGrowing alfalfa seed under irrigation has frequently proved very\r\nprofitable. The seed grown in such areas is larger and more attractive\r\nto the eye than that ordinarily grown in the absence of irrigation, and\r\nbecause of this many are lured into sowing it on unirrigated land when\r\nthe former would better serve their purpose. The seed is frequently\r\nadulterated with that of yellow clover (_Medicago lupulina_), which\r\nresembles it closely, but this is more likely to be true of imported\r\nthan of American grown seed.\r\n\r\n=Renewing.=--Alfalfa may be renewed and also renovated where the stand\r\nsecured at the first has been insufficient, where it may have been\r\ninjured from various causes, where it is being crowded with weeds, and\r\neven with useful grasses, and where the land requires enriching.\r\n\r\nThe stand of alfalfa secured is sometimes thin and uneven. This may\r\narise from such causes as sowing too little seed; whether over-dry or\r\nthrough the crowding of the young plants. When this happens, in many\r\nsituations it is quite practicable to thicken the stand by disking the\r\nground more or less, adding fresh seed, according to the need of the\r\ncrop, and then covering the seed thus added with the harrow. Such\r\nrenovation would be comparatively easy on clean land, were it not for\r\nfact that the alfalfa plants already rooted overshadow the young plants,\r\nalways to their injury, and sometimes to their total destruction. The\r\nspring will probably be the best season to attempt such renovation, but\r\nthere may be instances where the winters are not severe, in which autumn\r\nseeding will succeed as well or better than spring seeding. Because of\r\nthe uncertainty of the results of such renovation, the aim should be so\r\nto prepare the land and sow the seed that a good, thick stand will be\r\nsecured at the first.\r\n\r\nShould the alfalfa fields be spotted, because in places the nurse crop\r\nlodged and smothered the plants, or because excessive moisture destroyed\r\nthem on the lower portions of the field in an abnormally wet season,\r\nthe renewing process is simple indeed. It consists in disking those\r\nparts so thoroughly as to destroy all vegetation that may have become\r\nrooted on them, and sowing seed in the usual way without a nurse crop.\r\nBut should the low places be such as to hold an excess of water at any\r\ntime of the year under normal conditions for days in succession, even\r\nthough it should not rise to the surface, the attempts to make alfalfa\r\ngrow successfully on these will prove abortive.\r\n\r\nWhen weeds and grasses crowd the crop, the plan of disking the fields to\r\ndestroy these is becoming quite common, especially in the West. The work\r\nis usually done in the early spring. In doing it, disk harrows are\r\ndriven over the field, usually two ways, the second disking being done\r\nat right angles to the first. The disks are set at that angle which will\r\ndo the least injury to the plants, and that will at the same time do the\r\nwork effectively. This can only be determined by actual test in each\r\ninstance. Some of the crowns of the plants will be split open by the\r\ndisk, which some authorities claim is an advantage in that it tends to\r\nan increase in the number of the stems produced, an opinion which is by\r\nno means held in common at the present time, and yet there are\r\nlocalities where it has certainly proved advantageous. Occasionally, a\r\nplant will be cut off. There can be no doubt, however, that such\r\ndisking, when necessary, does tend to clean the land and also to\r\nstrengthen growth in the alfalfa crop, on the principle that cultivation\r\nwhich does not seriously disturb growing plants is always helpful to\r\nthem. The frequency of such diskings will depend on the needs of the\r\ncrop. Some advocate disking every spring, some every other spring, and\r\nsome not at all. That plan which disks the ground only when it is\r\nnecessary to keep the weeds at bay would seem to be the most sensible.\r\nThis would mean that sometimes, as where crab grass has a firm hold,\r\ndisking may be necessary at least for a time every spring. In other\r\ninstances it would be necessary only every second or third season, and\r\nin yet other instances not at all. However, some growers in dry areas\r\nadvocate disking frequently, as, for instance, after some of the\r\ncuttings of the hay, and with a view to retain moisture. It is at least\r\nquestionable, however, if disking so frequently would not soon tend to\r\nthin the plants too much, to say nothing of the labor while the work is\r\nbeing done.\r\n\r\nThe idea of stirring the surface soil in alfalfa fields is by no means\r\nnew. In England the plan prevailed to some extent years ago of harrowing\r\nthe fields in the autumn with heavy harrows until, when the process was\r\ncompleted, they would take on the appearance of the bare fallow for a\r\ntime. In the Eastern States and in some parts of Canada the harrow is\r\nused instead of the disk, but usually the latter will do the work more\r\neffectively and with less cost. Frequently, when the disk has been used\r\non alfalfa, it may also be advantageous to run a light harrow over the\r\nground to smoothen the surface.\r\n\r\nWith a view to renovate the crop and increase the yields, in some\r\nsections, as in the Atlantic States, it has been recommended to\r\ntop-dress alfalfa fields with farmyard manure every autumn. This, no\r\ndoubt, would prove very effective, but it would also be very expensive,\r\nunless in the neighborhood of large cities. It would be impracticable\r\nwithout neglecting the needs of the other crops of the farm. In the\r\nmountain areas of the West, it has been found that the cost of\r\nfertilizing with farmyard manure is in the meantime greater than the\r\nincreased production in the alfalfa is worth, but it may not be always\r\nthus, even on these rich lands. Some Eastern growers also apply more or\r\nless gypsum. This is generally sown over the fields after the crop has\r\nbegun to grow in the spring.\r\n\r\nRenovating alfalfa fields is much more easily and effectively done, as\r\nwould naturally be expected, in areas where conditions are highly\r\nfavorable to its growth than where these are only moderately favorable.\r\nIn some of the mountain valleys instances have occurred in which alfalfa\r\nfields have been plowed and sown with oats, with a result, first that a\r\ngood crop of oats was reaped, and second, that fairly good crops of\r\nalfalfa were harvested the following season without re-sowing the field.\r\n\r\n=Sources of Injury to Alfalfa.=--Chief among the sources of injury to\r\nalfalfa, after the plants have become established, are frost in\r\nsaturated ground, ice, floods, grasshoppers, gophers, dodder, and\r\npasturing by live stock in the late autumn or winter. When it happens\r\nthat two or three of these act in conjunction, the injury following is\r\njust so much more rapid and complete. As has been intimated, where\r\nwater is excessive, in a climate which in winter or spring is\r\ncharacterized by alternations of freezing and thawing, the plants will\r\neither have the roots snapped asunder, or they will be gradually raised\r\nout of the ground. This will only happen in soil with a subsoil more\r\nretentive than is compatible with well-doing of the highest order in the\r\nplants. The danger from this source is greatest during the first winter\r\nafter sowing the plants, as then the roots are not really established.\r\nThe only remedy for such a contingency is the draining of the land.\r\n\r\nSome reference has also been made to injury done through ice, where it\r\ncollects in low places in land. The destructiveness of the ice depends\r\non its thickness and its nearness to the ground. When it rests upon the\r\nground for any considerable time the plants die. If, however, water\r\nintervenes, the plants may live when the submergence is for a limited\r\ntime. One instance is on record in Onondaga County in New York State, in\r\nwhich alfalfa survived submergence for a considerable period under a\r\nthin sheet of water covered by three inches of ice, but when growth came\r\nit was for a time less vigorous than normal.\r\n\r\nFloods in warm weather are greatly injurious to alfalfa. The extent of\r\nthe injury done increases with increase of depth in the waters of\r\nsubmergence, increase in stagnation in the waters, and increase in the\r\nduration of the period of overflow. Stagnant water sooner loses its\r\ndissolved nitrogen; hence, the plants cannot breathe normally. The harm\r\ndone, therefore, by floods in each case can only be known by waiting to\r\nsee the results. These summer floods always harm the crops temporarily,\r\nand in many instances kill them outright. Occasional periods of overflow\r\nshould not prevent the sowing of alfalfa on such lands, since on these\r\nit is usually not difficult to start a new crop, but the seed should not\r\nbe sown on such lands when overflow occurs at such a season. When it\r\noccurs in cool weather and quickly subsides, it may be possible to grow\r\npaying crops of alfalfa.\r\n\r\nIn some areas grasshoppers are a real scourge in alfalfa fields. Because\r\nof the shade provided by the ground and the influence which this exerts\r\nin softening it, they are encouraged to deposit their eggs and remain so\r\nas to prove a source of trouble the following year. It has been found\r\nthat through disking of the land both ways after sharp frosts have come\r\nis greatly effective in destroying the grasshopper eggs deposited in the\r\nsoil. They are thus exposed to the action of the subsequent frosts and\r\nso perish. The disking has also tended to stimulate growth in the crop\r\nthe following year. The eggs will not, of course, be all destroyed by\r\nsuch disking, but so large a percentage will, that the crop should be\r\npractically protected from serious injury, unless when grasshoppers come\r\nfrom elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt would seem correct to say that gophers do more injury to alfalfa\r\nfields in certain areas of the West than comes to them from all other\r\nsources combined. They not only destroy the plants by feeding upon them,\r\nbut they fill the soil with mounds, which greatly interfere with the\r\nharvesting of the crops. They are destroyed by giving them poisoned\r\nfood, trapping, shooting, and suffocating through the use of bisulphide\r\nof carbon. Poison is frequently administered by soaking grain in\r\nstrychnine or dropping it on pieces of potato and putting the same in or\r\nnear the burrows. Bisulphide of carbon is put upon a rag or other\r\nsubstance, which is put into the burrow and the opening closed.\r\n\r\nDodder is a parasitical plant introduced, probably, in seed from Europe,\r\nwhich feeds upon alfalfa plants, to their destruction. The seeds of\r\nalfalfa sometimes become so impregnated with the seeds of dodder that\r\nthe latter will grow where the seed is sown, thus introducing it to new\r\ncenters. The dodder starts in the soil and soon throws up its\r\ngolden-colored thread-like stems, which reach out and fasten on the\r\nalfalfa plants that grow sufficiently near. The dodder then loses its\r\nhold upon the soil and gets its food entirely from the alfalfa plants,\r\nwhich it ultimately destroys. But since the seeds of the dodder remain\r\nat least for a time in the soil, and the adjacent soil becomes infected\r\nwith them, the circles in which the dodder feeds continually widen. In\r\ncertain parts of New York State some fields have become so seriously\r\naffected as to lead to investigations conducted through officials from\r\nthe State experiment station. Pending these investigations, the exercise\r\nof great care in the purchase of seed and the immediate plowing of the\r\ninfested areas are recommended.\r\n\r\nSome reference has already been made to injurious results from\r\npasturing close in the autumn or winter, except in the most favored\r\nalfalfa regions. In addition to what has been already said, the wisdom\r\nof not grazing alfalfa the first year is here emphasized, and also the\r\nmistake of grazing at any time when the ground is frozen, at least in\r\nareas east of and, generally speaking, adjacent to the Mississippi\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\n=Alfalfa as a Fertilizer.=--Alfalfa is not considered equal to medium\r\nred clover as a direct means of fertilizing and otherwise improving the\r\nland on which it grows. This does not arise from less inherent power on\r\nthe part of alfalfa to draw nitrogen from the air and deposit it in the\r\nsoil, but rather from the fact that clover establishes itself more\r\nquickly, and is much more frequently grown in the rotation. Several\r\ncrops of medium red clover can be grown in short rotations, each one\r\nbeing a source of much benefit to the crops that follow, while one crop\r\nof alfalfa occupies the land. But when the alfalfa is all fed upon the\r\nfarm on which it grew, where the plants grow freely, it then becomes a\r\nsource of fertilization without a rival, probably, among plants grown\r\nupon the farm.\r\n\r\nThe fertility thus furnished does not consist so much in the plant food\r\ndeposited in the soil directly as in that furnished in the successive\r\ncrops that are grown and fed every year. In Farmers' Bulletin No. 133,\r\npublished by the United States Department of Agriculture, it is stated\r\nthat the Wyoming Experiment Station found 44 pounds of nitrogen, 8.27\r\npounds of phosphoric acid, and 50.95 pounds of potash in one ton of\r\nalfalfa. This would mean that in the yield of alfalfa hay from a given\r\narea, estimated at four tons per acre for the season, alfalfa would\r\nfurnish 176 pounds of nitrogen, 33.08 pounds of phosphoric acid, and\r\n203.8 pounds of potash. If this alfalfa were fed upon the farm, it would\r\nnot only prove a cheap source of protein for feeding, but it would\r\nfurnish fertility, as stated above, without seriously diminishing the\r\nsupply of the same in the surface soil, since much of the fertilizing\r\nmaterial produced would come from the air and subsoil. The manure thus\r\nmade, if carefully saved and applied, would thus add materially to the\r\nfertility of the land. If, however, the alfalfa were sold, the mineral\r\nmatter drawn from the cultivable area of the soil and from the subsoil\r\nlying under it would be reduced to the extent of the draft made upon\r\nthese in growing the alfalfa.\r\n\r\nThe direct influence of alfalfa upon the fertility of the land on which\r\nit grows is shown in the greatly increased production in the crops which\r\nfollow alfalfa. This increase is not only marked, but it is frequently\r\ndiscernible for several successive years. But as has been intimated, the\r\nbenefit that would otherwise accrue from growing alfalfa as a direct\r\nmeans of fertilizing the land is much circumscribed by the long term of\r\nyears for which it is usually grown.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical effects of alfalfa upon the land are beneficent. It\r\nimproves the tilth by means of the shade furnished, and the extent to\r\nwhich the roots fill the soil. These in their decay further influence\r\nfavorably that friability which is so desirable in soils that are\r\ncultivated, and as previously stated, the long, deep roots in their\r\ndecay exercise a salutary influence on drainage.\r\n\r\nThe work of breaking alfalfa fields is frequently laborious, owing to\r\nthe number and size of the roots. If, however, a plow is used, the share\r\nof which has a serrated edge, the roots will be cut or broken off more\r\neasily and more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nALSIKE CLOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nAlsike Clover (_Trifolium hybridum_) takes its name from a parish in the\r\nsouth of Sweden. From there it is probable that it was introduced into\r\nEngland. Linnaeus gave it the name of _hybridum_, imagining it to be a\r\ncross between the red and the white varieties. Botanists do not\r\ngenerally hold this view. It is known by various names, as Swedish,\r\nWhite Swedish, Alsace, Hybrid, Perennial Hybrid, Elegant and Pod Clover,\r\nbut more commonly in America it is spoken of as alsike.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this variety are more slender than those of the medium red\r\nvariety, although they grow in some instances to a greater height. The\r\nslender stems are much branched. The leaves are numerous and oblong in\r\nshape, the flowers are of a pinkish tint, the heads are globular and are\r\nabout three-fourths of an inch in diameter, and the pods, like those in\r\nwhite clover, contain more than one seed. The roots are in no small\r\ndegree fibrous, and yet the slender tap root goes down to a considerable\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAlsike clover is a perennial. In favorable situations it will live for\r\nmany years. Ordinarily, it grows to the height of 18 to 24 inches, but\r\nin slough lands it sometimes grows to the height of 5 feet. The plants\r\ndo not reach their full size until the second year, and in some\r\ninstances until a period even later. They grow less rapidly than those\r\nof medium red clover, are several weeks later coming into flower, and\r\ngrow much less vigorously in the autumn. Ordinarily, they furnish but\r\none cutting of hay each year. Because of the more fibrous character of\r\nthe root growth, the plants do not heave so readily as those of red\r\nclover. In moist situations they are much given to lodge; hence, the\r\nimportance of growing this crop, when grown for hay, along with some\r\nkind of grass that will help to keep the stems erect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Alsike Clover (_Trifolium hybridum_)\r\n  Oregon Experiment Station]\r\n\r\nAlsike clover furnishes a large amount of pasture. It is relished, at\r\nleast, fairly well. The leaves are slightly bitter, but not enough to\r\nseriously interfere with their palatability. The quality of the hay is\r\nexcellent. This arises from its fineness, from the number of the small\r\nbranches and leaves on the stems, and from its fragrance when well\r\ncured. While it makes a very suitable hay for horses and cattle, it has\r\npeculiar adaptation for sheep, owing to its fineness.\r\n\r\nAs a fertilizer it is probably not equal to medium red clover, since the\r\nroot growth is not so bulky. Nor does it produce a second cutting\r\nanything like so vigorous as the former. Nevertheless, the roots possess\r\neven stiff soils to such an extent that they not only furnish them with\r\nmuch plant food, but they also tend to disintegrate them and to render\r\nthem more easy to pulverize.\r\n\r\nAs a honey plant, alsike clover is without a rival among clovers, unless\r\nit be in the small white variety. It is a great favorite with\r\nbee-keepers. Many of them sow it to enable them to furnish pastures for\r\ntheir bees. The bloom remains for a relatively long period. The honey is\r\nalso accessible to the common honey bee, since the branches are numerous\r\non the stems, and since each branch bears a head, the flower heads are\r\nrelatively quite numerous. Since the honey is accessible to the common\r\nbee, pollination in the plants is assured; hence, the failures in the\r\nseed crop are few, and when other conditions are favorable, seed\r\nproduction is abundant. Because of the many good qualities of this\r\nclover it is deservedly a favorite wherever it can be successfully\r\ngrown. When in full bloom, a field of alsike clover is a very beautiful\r\nsight. The flowers are a pale white at first, but gradually they deepen\r\ninto a beautiful pink of tinted shades, and their fragrance is fully\r\nequal to their beauty.\r\n\r\n=Distribution.=--Alsike clover is found in Europe, Northern Africa and\r\nWestern Asia. In these it has been cultivated for a long time, but its\r\nfavorite home in the Old World would seem to be in Northern Europe. It\r\nwould doubtless be correct to say that it is indigenous to Europe, and\r\nprobably that it is indigenous to each of the three continents named. It\r\nis not indigenous to America, but was introduced into the same probably\r\nfrom Great Britain or Scandinavia. In some parts of North America it\r\ngrows with a luxuriance equal to, if not, indeed, greater, than that\r\nshown by this plant when grown under the most favorable conditions\r\nwhich Europe furnishes.\r\n\r\nThis plant is better adapted to a cool and humid climate than to one hot\r\nand dry. It is even more hardy than medium red clover, in the sense of\r\nenduring cold, and will live under conditions of climate so austere as\r\nto be fatal to red clover. It may, therefore, be grown further north\r\nthan medium red clover, and under conditions so exposed as to cause\r\nmedium red clover to fail. But it does not succeed quite so well as the\r\nformer toward the southerly limit of the successful production of medium\r\nred clover; hence, the limit of production in the semi-arid belt ceases\r\nsooner than in the case of the other variety. The best climatic\r\nconditions for growing it are found not far from the boundary line\r\nbetween the United States and Canada, and in the vicinity of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific oceans and the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the best crops are grown in the States which border\r\non Canada, and in these the highest adaptation, climate and soil\r\nconsidered, is found in Michigan, Wisconsin and Northeastern Minnesota.\r\nBut in New York the adaptation is also high, and also in certain parts\r\nof Montana, Idaho and Washington. Good crops may also be grown in nearly\r\nall the second tier of States that lie southward from the Canadian\r\nboundary. The exceptions are those embraced in the semi-arid belt.\r\nFurther south than the second tier of States to which reference has just\r\nbeen made, the successful growth of alsike generally lessens, and yet in\r\nparts of these States, as, for instance, Kentucky, Tennessee and\r\nMissouri, good crops are grown. Some of the Rocky Mountain valleys, more\r\nespecially those that can be irrigated, and that are also sufficiently\r\nelevated, grow excellent crops of alsike. Much of the province of\r\nOntario has very high adaptation to the growth of alsike clover, and in\r\nseveral counties of that province large quantities are grown, not only\r\nfor hay, but also for seed. In Ontario County in the said province, are\r\ncertain clay soils rich in lime; in fact, almost marley in character,\r\nwhich have been found especially well adapted to growing alsike clover\r\nseed, and in certain areas in proximity to the Georgian Bay, adaptation\r\nexists about equally high. In some parts of Quebec good crops are also\r\ngrown. But this variety of clover has not been grown as yet with much\r\nsuccess in Manitoba, Assiniboia, Alberta or Saskatchewan. Both soil and\r\nclimate, however, in these provinces should not be uncongenial to it in\r\nthe main. In the cultivable lands of British Columbia, as in those of\r\nWashington, it grows remarkably well. Especially in the river bottoms\r\nand on the tide lands can immense crops be grown, as also on the tide\r\nlands of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but not on the upland sandy\r\nsoils of these provinces.\r\n\r\n=Soils.=--The most suitable soil for alsike clover is a moist clay loam,\r\nnot too friable nor too dense, and moist and deep. A goodly impregnation\r\nof lime in the same is favorable to maximum production. Abundant\r\nmoisture conduces to the same end. This plant will, however, produce\r\ngood crops, and in a moist season, excellent crops, on the stiffest\r\nclays, whether white or red, after a good stand has once been secured,\r\nproviding hard pan is not found near the surface, but in dry seasons it\r\nis not easy to secure a stand on such soils. The plants send their\r\nfibrous roots down into the soil in all directions, and in this way\r\nrender it much more friable when it is broken up.\r\n\r\nNext in adaptation, probably, come slough soils, even though covered\r\nwith humus to a considerable depth, providing that clay lies under the\r\nhumus. Enormous crops of hay or pasture can be grown on such soils, but\r\nthe crops of seed are not usually so large as on the moist clays\r\nreferred to above. On these also the hay is much more liable to lodge,\r\nunless supported by some kind of grass growing along with it.\r\n\r\nAfter slough soils come those that have been deposited by the action of\r\nwater, as in river beds and on lake bottoms, when the waters have\r\nsubsided, providing the clay element so necessary to the successful\r\ngrowth of this clover is plentifully present. In some instances the very\r\nbest crops of alsike can be grown on such lands, but in many other\r\ninstances these deposit soils have in them too much sand to produce\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nGood crops can be grown on sandy loam soils, if well stored with\r\nvegetable matter, and at the same time fairly well impregnated with\r\nclay, but if one or both of these elements is lacking, adaptation in\r\nthese soils will be correspondingly reduced.\r\n\r\nOn the average upland prairie soil, alsike clover does not grow so\r\nvigorously as the medium red. The less of density that these possess\r\nunder ordinary conditions, the less suitable are they to the needs of\r\nthis plant, but when ample moisture is present, good crops may be grown\r\non much of the soil in prairie areas.\r\n\r\nSoils lowest in adaptation to the growth of alsike include infertile\r\nsands and gravels, and the vegetable soils of the prairie so light that\r\nwhen cultivated they lift more or less with the wind. On such soils the\r\ngrowth of alsike is short and feeble, and any lack of moisture renders\r\nit increasingly so.\r\n\r\nThis plant not only requires much moisture to insure the most vigorous\r\ngrowth, but it is also able to thrive under conditions of soil\r\nsaturation such as some of the useful forage plants could not endure.\r\nWhen the weather is cool, it may be covered with shallow water for\r\nseveral days in succession without apparent injury. The possession of\r\nthis characteristic makes it possible to grow alsike clover in sloughs\r\nnot yet drained, but which are dry certain portions of the year.\r\n\r\n=Place in the Rotation.=--Much of what has been said about the place for\r\nmedium red clover in the rotation may also apply to alsike clover. (See\r\npage 70.) On upland soils its place in the rotation will be very similar\r\nto that of the other variety, but with the difference that the rotations\r\nwill be longer, because of the perennial habit of growth in the alsike.\r\nIt will be best sown, therefore, on clean land which has produced a crop\r\nthat has been cultivated the previous year. Consequently, it may follow\r\nsuch crops as corn, potatoes, field roots and beans in the North, and\r\nthe same crops in the South, with the addition of cow peas, soy beans\r\nand the non-saccharine sorghums. But it may be sown after other crops\r\nwhen necessary, especially when it is to be pastured. One chief\r\nobjection to sowing it thus for hay is that the hay will be less free\r\nfrom weeds.\r\n\r\nOn upland this crop may be followed with any kind of a crop requiring\r\nmuch nitrogen. No crops can be made to follow it with more advantage,\r\nhowever, than corn and the sorghums, or potatoes. Rape will feed\r\nravenously on the overturned sod, and wheat and the other small grains\r\nwill also feed similarly.\r\n\r\nOn low lands, especially when they partake of the nature of sloughs, the\r\nrotation is different. In some instances alsike may follow the natural\r\ngrasses produced by the slough in the drained or undrained form, as the\r\ncase may be, and may be made to supersede them without breaking the\r\nland, but more commonly on these it is sown after the natural sod has\r\nbeen broken and has decayed somewhat, by growing on it some such crop as\r\nrape or flax. On these lands it is usually grown in long rotations for\r\npasture and also for hay, and when the sod is again plowed, it is\r\nfollowed by corn, potatoes, rape, and grains grown for soiling uses,\r\nsince such land has naturally high adaptation for these. Flax also is a\r\nfavorite crop to sow in such situations after alsike clover.\r\n\r\n=Preparing the Soil.=--The preparation of the land for alsike clover on\r\nordinary soils is the same as for medium red clover. (See page 74.)\r\nUsually, that degree of fineness in the pulverization which best\r\nprepares the soil for the nurse crop with which alsike clover is sown,\r\nwill also best prepare it for the alsike. But there may be some\r\ninstances, as in strong clays, when a fine pulverization that would\r\nsuffice for the needs of the nurse crop would be advantageous to the\r\nalsike. This finer pulverization can only be secured by the judicious\r\nuse of the roller and the harrow. In loose-lying soils, more especially\r\nin areas where the precipitation in winter comes in the form of snow,\r\nand, therefore, does not wash the land as it does when it falls as rain,\r\nif the land on which alsike is to be sown is plowed in the fall, and\r\nonly harrowed in the spring, or cultivated and harrowed when preparing\r\nit, the moisture will be better conserved than if it were plowed in the\r\nspring. When thus managed, strong clays in the area under consideration\r\nwill usually have a much finer pulverization than can be obtained from\r\nspring plowing. When the preceding crop has been given clean\r\ncultivation, to plow land subsequently before sowing to alsike would\r\nbring up many weed seeds to the surface, where they would at once begin\r\nto grow. On slough lands, where water saturation is present during a\r\nportion of the year, even to the extent of appearing for a short\r\ninterval over more or less of the surface, the seed may be sown without\r\nany previous preparation of the land, and in some instances\r\nsuccessfully. In other instances it will fail should the following\r\nsummer prove adverse. The stand is rendered much more certain in such\r\ninstances by first burning off the grass, sowing the seed upon it,\r\ncovering it more or less with the harrow and running the mower over the\r\nground, say, twice in the season, to let in sunlight to the young\r\nplants. The grass thus mown may be left as a mulch. Pasturing, but not\r\ntoo early in the season, will in some instances give results equally\r\ngood. In such situations the sowing should be done, and also the\r\nharrowing, before the frost has left the ground, except for a short\r\ndistance from the surface, or the horses may sink too deeply when doing\r\nthe work. The success is dependent in no small degree on the denseness\r\nor want of denseness of the root growth of the grass plants already\r\ncovering the soil. The more dense these are, the less easy is it to\r\nobtain a stand, and the more peaty the soil immediately underneath the\r\nsurface, the greater is the danger that the young plants will perish in\r\na time of drought.\r\n\r\nWhen alsike seed is sown on drained sloughs, the aim should be to reduce\r\nthe excess of coarse vegetable matter, if present, and to secure a\r\nsmooth surface, such as will facilitate the easy mowing of the crop.\r\nMore especially should this be the aim if the alsike is sown to produce\r\nhay. This can be most easily and speedily done by growing on it some\r\nreducing crop, as flax or rape, and then smoothing the surface by\r\nimplements best suited to such work, as, for instance, some form of plow\r\nleveler.\r\n\r\n=Sowing.=--The time at which alsike clover may best be sown is the same\r\nas that for sowing the medium red variety; that is to say, the early\r\nspring. (See page 75.) Since it is hardier than the medium red variety,\r\nthe danger is less that spring frosts will destroy the plants after they\r\nbegin to grow. As with medium red clover, it may also be sown at sundry\r\ntimes, from the opening of spring until the late summer when the\r\nopportunity offers, and when the conditions for growth are favorable.\r\nFor instance, there may be seasons when alsike clover, and, indeed, any\r\nkind of clover, will succeed along with a catch crop sown for pasture or\r\nto provide soiling food. But it should not be sown in the autumn unless\r\nwhere the winters are mild, or the young plants will not survive their\r\nrigors.\r\n\r\nAlsike clover is more commonly sown with a nurse crop. As with medium\r\nred, the crops with which it may be best sown are the small cereal\r\ngrains, as winter rye, barley, wheat and oats, favorable in the order\r\nnamed. But it may also be sown with flax, with rape, and with grain\r\ncrops that are to be cut for soiling or to be grazed down.\r\n\r\nThe method of sowing alsike clover is virtually the same as that\r\nfollowed in sowing medium red clover (see page 78); that is to say, it\r\nmay be sown by hand machines, with a grass-seeder attachment to the\r\ngrain drill, or with the ordinary tubes of the grain drill and along\r\nwith the grain. The seed is very small, and, consequently, may not admit\r\nof being buried so deeply as medium red clover, but in the open soils of\r\nthe prairie it will sometimes succeed as well sown along with the grain\r\nas when buried less deeply, but in many soils the roller will provide a\r\nsufficient covering. Especially is this true in climates that are moist.\r\n\r\nAlsike clover has special adaptation for being sown along with timothy\r\nand red top on slough soils, and soils made up of rich deposit. It\r\nmatures about the same time as these grasses. They support the slender\r\nstems of the alsike, and in doing so prevent lodging more or less. This\r\ngreatly improves the quality of the hay. The more numerous the plants in\r\nthose mixtures, the finer also will be the quality of the hay. If but\r\ntwo varieties are wanted in the mixture, ordinarily these two should be\r\nalsike clover and timothy. Both furnish hay of excellent quality; hence,\r\nwhen the proportion of alsike is not too large, such hay sells readily\r\nto dairymen who have to purchase fodder.\r\n\r\nAlthough this clover does not mature until three to four weeks later\r\nthan the medium red, nevertheless, it may be well to add the latter to\r\nthe timothy and alsike clover mixture. When these are thus sown in due\r\nbalance, the first cutting will be mainly red clover, after which there\r\nwill be but little of the red present. But the medium red clover will\r\nadd much to the pasture after the first cutting for hay. Subsequently,\r\nthe hay crop will usually consist of alsike and timothy. Alsike clover\r\nalong with timothy may also be sown with mammoth clover, since the two\r\nmature about the same time. But the mammoth variety will monopolize the\r\nground while the first hay crop is being produced. The advantage from\r\nsowing the seed thus lies chiefly in prolonging the period of clover\r\nproduction along with timothy grown chiefly for hay. It is not wise,\r\nusually, to sow alsike clover alone for hay, owing to its tendency to\r\nlodge. In the South it is frequently sown with red top and orchard\r\ngrass, especially the latter. It fills in the spaces between the plants\r\nin the orchard grass, and in so doing adds much to the hay or to the\r\npasture.\r\n\r\nThere may be conditions in which it would be advisable to sow alsike\r\nclover alone, as when it is wanted for seed, and subsequently for\r\npasture. But ordinarily to provide pasture, it is better to sow it along\r\nwith some other grass or clover, or with a number of these. It greatly\r\nimproves a timothy pasture in the upland or in the valley. It has also\r\nbeen used with much advantage in strengthening alfalfa pastures for\r\nhorses in winter in certain of the Rocky Mountain valleys. It would\r\nprobably be correct to say that with the area of adaptation for this\r\nplant, no kind of pasture can be grown on reasonably moist land that\r\nwould not be benefited by having alsike in it. Among the clovers it has,\r\nrelatively, high adaptation for permanent pastures, because of its\r\nenduring character.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of alsike clover are small. They are considered to be less\r\nthan half the size of those of medium red clover, consequently, the\r\namounts of seed are relatively much less. When alsike clover is sown\r\nalone and for seed, from 3 to 5 pounds of seed should suffice per acre,\r\naccording to the soil conditions. Four pounds are frequently sown. In\r\nthe various mixtures given above, the amounts of seed will vary with\r\nlocal and other conditions, but the following amounts may be given as\r\naverages: Alsike and timothy, 4 and 6 pounds, respectively, per acre;\r\nalsike, timothy and red top, 3, 4 and 3 pounds; alsike, timothy and red\r\nclover, 3, 4 and 3 pounds; alsike, timothy and mammoth clover, 3, 4 and\r\n3 pounds. When sown with other grasses for pasture, it would not be\r\npossible to give the amounts to sow that would best meet the needs of\r\nthe grower under all conditions. But it may be said that 1 to 2 pounds\r\nof alsike seed per acre, sown under almost any circumstances in moist\r\nsoils and within the alsike clover area, will be a good investment when\r\nlaying down pastures of any considerable permanency.\r\n\r\nThis clover is also sometimes added to the seed sown in making lawns,\r\nmore especially on farms where the lawn cannot be given that close\r\nattention which is necessary to keep it in the most presentable form.\r\nBecause of its permanence, it is helpful in giving variety to the sward,\r\nand when mown but two or three times in the season, as is frequently the\r\ncase with such lawns, it provides considerable bloom in the same, which\r\nis very attractive. The amount of seed to use on these lawns may vary to\r\nsuit the desires of the owner. It is not usual, however, to sow in these\r\nmore than maximum amounts for field crops. At the rate of 3 to 4 pounds\r\nof seed per acre should be ample.\r\n\r\n=Pasturing.=--Alsike clover has by some authorities been assigned to a\r\nhigh place as a pasture plant. For such a use it has no little merit,\r\nbut in the judgment of the author it is not nearly equal to medium red\r\nclover as a pasture plant, under average conditions, since it does not\r\ngrow so well, relatively, on average upland soils, and because the\r\naftermath is usually light, after the crop has been cut for hay or for\r\nseed. Nor is it thought to be relished quite as highly by stock as the\r\nmedium red clover. Nevertheless, domestic animals eat it freely, and\r\nunder suitable conditions it will furnish for them a considerable amount\r\nof grazing. This feature has been finely illustrated by an experiment in\r\ngrazing conducted at the Agricultural Experiment Station of Montana, on\r\nirrigated land, at Bozeman, in the Gallatin valley. Full particulars\r\nrelating to this unique experiment are given in Bulletin No. 31, issued\r\nby the afore-mentioned station. In the summer of 1900, 18 cattle, one\r\nand two years old, were pastured on 5.04 acres of alsike clover for 102\r\ndays, beginning with June 9th. The increase in the weight obtained from\r\nthe pasture in the time stated was 4560 pounds. This gain was valued at\r\nthe very moderate price of 4 cents per pound live weight; hence, the net\r\nreturn per acre for the pasture for the season was $36.19. It would\r\nscarcely be possible under any conditions, howsoever favorable, to\r\nobtain such results without irrigation.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, the results from pasturing alsike clover will be more\r\nsatisfactory when one or two other plants are grown along with it, as,\r\nfor instance, medium red clover or medium red clover and orchard grass,\r\nsince both of these plants tend to prolong the period of grazing. In\r\nslough lands, red top and timothy add considerably to the value of the\r\ngrazing. When grazing alsike clover, much more pasture will be obtained\r\nif it can be allowed to make a good start in the spring, and if it is\r\nthen kept grazed so short that the plants do not come into flower. Such\r\ntreatment tends very much to prolong the period of grazing for the\r\nseason. Should the grazing be so uneven as to admit of certain areas in\r\nthe pasture pushing on into the flower stage, the mower may sometimes be\r\nprofitably used to prevent such a result. Weeds should also be kept from\r\ngoing to seed in the pastures by using the mower or the scythe, or both.\r\nNor should the fact be lost sight of that the tendency to produce bloat\r\nin alsike clover is much the same as in medium red clover.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting for Hay.=--Alsike clover is ready to harvest for hay when\r\nthe plants are just beginning to pass beyond the meridian of full bloom.\r\nSome of the first blossoms will then have turned brown and some of the\r\nsmaller ones will still be deepening their tints, since the season of\r\nbloom is about the same as for timothy, and since alsike for hay is more\r\ncommonly grown with timothy than with any other grass, both may be cut\r\nwhen at their best, especially when intended for cows and sheep. But\r\nwhen the hay is intended for horses, it should stand a few days longer\r\nthan the stage indicated above, in order to have the timothy in the\r\ncondition best suited to feeding horses. But the alsike, in the\r\nmeantime, would lose something in digestibility.\r\n\r\nIf grown alone for hay, the process of harvesting would be much the same\r\nas in harvesting medium red clover. (See page 95.) But since the stems\r\nof alsike clover are finer than those of the medium red, less time will\r\nsuffice for curing it. It will also cure more quickly along with some\r\nother grass than if alone, since it does not then lie so closely in the\r\nwinrow or in the cock. Grasses, as a rule, cure more quickly than\r\nclovers, and this also has a bearing on hastening curing in clover when\r\nthe two are grown together; and also in lessening the degree of the\r\nfermentation after the crop has been stored. Ordinarily, when the\r\nweather is bright, alsike clover along with timothy may be cut in the\r\nforenoon, tedded once or twice soon after cutting, raked into small\r\nwinrows the same evening and stored away the following afternoon. When\r\nthus managed, the hay loader may be used in lifting the hay from the\r\nwinrows. Alsike clover growing alone could not be cured thus quickly.\r\nNor would it be wise in showery weather to try and cure the crop without\r\nputting it into cocks, whether grown alone or with some other crop. When\r\nproperly cured, the heads retain much of their bloom and the stems much\r\nof their greenness.\r\n\r\nThe yields of hay vary greatly with the soil. On dry, sandy uplands the\r\nyields of cured hay may not exceed 1/2 ton, while on rich loam soils it\r\nmay exceed 3 tons. Ordinarily, on good soils a combined crop of alsike\r\nclover should yield from 1-1/2 to 2 tons per acre of very excellent hay.\r\nSome authorities speak of getting two cuttings per year, but this is not\r\nusual. Under quite favorable conditions it would be possible to get two\r\ncuttings for soiling uses, providing the first was taken when the plants\r\nwere coming into bloom. Usually, the growth of the aftermath, when the\r\nhay has been removed, is very moderate.\r\n\r\n=Securing Seed.=--Alsike is a great producer of seed. This arises in\r\npart from the relatively large number of the heads on the plants, and in\r\npart from the completeness of the pollinations, through the action of\r\nthe honey bee. These are relatively much more numerous than the bumble\r\nbees, which alone among bees, it has been claimed, aid in the\r\npollination of medium red and mammoth clover. Although the seeds are\r\nconsiderably less than half the size of those of medium red clover, as\r\nmuch as 8 bushels of seed have been secured from an acre. Frequently,\r\nhowever, the yields are less than 2 bushels. Good average yields may be\r\nstated as running from 3 to 4 bushels per acre. The best yields are\r\nusually obtained from the first crop, but under favorable conditions\r\nthis clover may be cut for seed for two and even three years in\r\nsuccession. Better yields are usually obtained from crops of medium\r\nvigor than from those of excessive rankness. The latter lodge to such an\r\nextent as to reduce materially the yields of the seed, since the heads\r\ndo not fill well. The cost of harvesting and threshing such crops is\r\nalso greater, relatively, than of those of medium growth. To prevent\r\nsuch excessive growth in the seed crop, pasturing for a time is\r\nfrequently resorted to. The grazing should begin reasonably early in the\r\nseason before growth anywhere becomes so rank that the animals do not\r\neat it in certain portions of the field, whereas, at the same time, they\r\ngraze other portions of the field too closely. Rather close grazing,\r\nfrom the time that grazing begins, is preferable to grazing that leaves\r\nthe crop uneven. When certain portions of the field are left ungrazed,\r\nor only partially grazed, the mower should be run over such portions\r\nabout the time that the grazing ceases. If this is done a few days\r\nbefore the removal of the stock, they will eat much of the clover thus\r\nmown. Unless the mower is thus used, under such conditions the seed will\r\nripen unevenly in the grazed and ungrazed portions of the same.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the grazing is much dependent on the soil and the\r\nseason. The more moist and rich the soil and the more moist the season,\r\nthe more prolonged should the grazing be. In Northern areas it seldom\r\nbegins earlier than May 1st, and seldom extends beyond June 1st. If\r\nprolonged unduly and dry weather follows, the growth of the plants will\r\nnot be enough to produce average crops of seed. Quite frequently on\r\nupland soils, the grazing should cease before the end of May.\r\n\r\nEither cattle or sheep, or both, may be used in the grazing. Cattle do\r\nnot graze quite so closely as sheep, which is so far favorable to\r\nsubsequent growth. But sheep will glean weeds to a much greater extent\r\nthan cattle. When the field is made to carry so much stock that the\r\ngrazing is quickly and thoroughly done, the results are usually more\r\nsatisfactory than when the opposite method is practiced.\r\n\r\nIt is important that weeds shall be prevented from maturing seeds in the\r\nclover. To prevent this, it may be necessary to run the mower over the\r\nwhole field at the close of the grazing season. In crops that are not\r\ngrazed, it may be necessary to use the scythe in clipping back weeds and\r\nin cutting off any stray heads of timothy that may be pushing up toward\r\nmaturity. In some instances it may even be found profitable to use the\r\nspud in destroying weeds of more dwarfish growth than those which can be\r\nclipped with the scythe. It is more important, relatively, that weeds\r\nshall be thus dealt with in growing alsike clover than in growing clover\r\nof the larger varieties, since, owing to the small size of the seeds of\r\nalsike, it is more difficult to remove foul seeds with the winnowing\r\nmill. No kind of seed, probably, is more difficult to separate from\r\nalsike seed than timothy; hence, when the former is grown for market,\r\nthese plants should not be grown together. If, perchance, they should be\r\nso grown and the crop cut for seed, it would be well not to try to\r\nseparate the seeds, but to sow them thus, as even when thus mixed the\r\nseed has a considerable market value.\r\n\r\nThe crop is ready for being harvested when nearly all the heads are\r\nfully matured. The bloom will then have left them and they will be\r\ncharacterized by a reddish cast. The earlier heads will have turned a\r\ndark color, almost black. Some bloom may yet linger on the later and\r\nsmaller heads, but harvesting should not be delayed until these mature.\r\n\r\nThe seed crop can best be cut with the self-rake reaper, which throws\r\noff the sheaves unbound. If cut with the grain binder, the sheaves\r\nshould not be bound. A sort of box attachment may be fastened to the\r\ncutter-bar of the mower, which will enable the workmen to leave the hay\r\nin sheaves, but to do this an additional hand is wanted to rake or pitch\r\noff the sheaves. The sheaves should be laid off in rows, and by system,\r\nrather than at random, for convenience in storing.\r\n\r\nUsually, the sheaves are not disturbed until ready for being stored, but\r\nin case of very heavy rain it may be necessary to turn the sheaves, to\r\nprevent the seeds which come in contact with the ground from sprouting.\r\nThe sheaves should be carefully lifted, otherwise many of the heads will\r\nbreak off and be lost. Because of this, it may be wise, frequently, to\r\nrefrain from lifting the sheaves for loading in the middle of the day.\r\nLarge forks, which may be run under the bunches, are more suitable than\r\nordinary forks.\r\n\r\nWhen absolutely necessary, the seed crop may be harvested with the field\r\nmower, as ordinarily used, but when it is thus harvested, the crop\r\nshould be cut with all promptness as soon as it is ready. It must then\r\nbe raked into winrows and lifted as hay is usually lifted. All the work\r\nof harvesting should be done in those portions of the day when the heads\r\nwill break off less freely, and when at the same time the dew is not\r\nresting on the seed plants in any considerable degree. When, however, a\r\ncrop of alsike is thus harvested for seed, many heads will break off,\r\nhowsoever careful the workmen may be.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be threshed at once or stored. Storing under a roof is\r\npreferable to storing in the stack, but the latter method will suffice,\r\nif the tops of the stacks are well protected with a covering of marsh\r\nhay or of some other suitable material. When the seed is not threshed at\r\nonce it is usual to defer threshing until cold weather, as with medium\r\nred clover, as then the seed is much more easily removed from the seed\r\npod. Ordinarily, the work can best be done by clover hullers, the same\r\nas are used in threshing medium red and mammoth clover, but grain\r\nseparators, with certain attachments, will now do this work in good\r\nform. Much care should be exercised in winnowing the seed. It ought to\r\nbe so cleaned that it will grade as No. 1, and so bring the highest\r\ncurrent price. Due care in this matter will make the major part of even\r\nordinary seed bring the best price.\r\n\r\n=Renewing.=--When the stand of the alsike is but partial, as, for\r\ninstance, when young plants have failed, or partially so, on the high\r\nland, and are sufficiently plentiful on the lower land, a full stand may\r\nsometimes be secured by simply scattering seed where it is needed so\r\nlate in the fall that it will not sprout before winter, covering with\r\nthe harrow and then top dressing with farmyard manure well decomposed.\r\nBut where the winters are so mild that the clover might be sprouted\r\nduring some warm spell followed by severe weather, the seed should not\r\nbe sown then.\r\n\r\nOn certain soils, as those naturally moist and porous, it may be\r\npossible so to renew alsike clover that it will produce hay or pasture\r\ncrops almost indefinitely, by simply allowing some heads to seed every\r\nyear and fall to the ground. In meadows, this may be done by not\r\ngrazing after the hay has been harvested until other heads have formed\r\nand ripened. A limited number of these will thus form after the crop has\r\nbeen mown for hay. If the crop has been cut for seed, many heads will in\r\nany event be left upon the ground. The same result will follow when\r\ngrazing the crop, if grazing is made to cease at the right time, and for\r\na period long enough to allow a considerable number of heads to mature.\r\nThis method of renewal will not prove a complete success on all soils,\r\nas, for instance, on those very stiff and very light.\r\n\r\nNatural meadows that lie low may be changed in whole or in part into\r\nalsike meadows or pastures in some of the States, as has been previously\r\nintimated, by sowing seed on them in the early spring. (See page 202.)\r\nIn some instances such change has been effected by sowing seed but once,\r\nand at the rate of from 3 to 4 pounds per acre. In other instances it\r\nhas been found preferable to sow a less quantity for two successive\r\nseasons, lest one of the two should prove adverse to successful growth\r\nin the plants. But on some slough soils a stand cannot be secured by\r\nthis method of sowing, more especially when they are composed of raw\r\npeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMAMMOTH CLOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nMammoth Clover (_Trifolium magnum_) was long ago named _Trifolium\r\nmedium_ by Linnaeus. However appropriate the designation may have been at\r\nthe time, it is not so now, at least under American conditions, as in\r\nthis country there is no other variety of clover so large, unless sweet\r\nclover (_Melilotus alba_). To apply to it the distinguishing term\r\nmedium, therefore, is positively misleading, since the smaller variety\r\nof red clover commonly grown occupies such middle ground, as the term\r\nmedium would indicate. Because of this, the author has ventured to\r\ndesignate it _Trifolium magnum_. It has also been classified, and with\r\nno little appropriateness, _Trifolium pratense perenne_, which has\r\nreference to the mildly perennial habit of growth in this plant. In\r\ncommon phrase it is known by such names as Large, Tall, Saplin or\r\nSapling, Giant, Meadow, Perennial Red, Red Perennial Meadow, Pea Vine,\r\nZigzag, Wavy Stemmed, Soiling, and Cow clover or Cow grass. Each of\r\nthese names has reference to some peculiarity of growth in the plant.\r\nFor instance, the terms Large, Tall, Saplin and Giant have reference to\r\nthe size of the plant; and the terms Pea Vine, Zigzag and Wavy Stemmed\r\nto the somewhat irregular and trailing habit of growth in the stems,\r\nand so of the others. The designation Cow grass is an English term.\r\n\r\nMammoth clover is a large variety of red clover; in fact, the largest\r\nvariety of red clover in America. The plants are strong, stronger than\r\nthose of the medium red variety, and the stems are much larger. They are\r\nsofter than those of the medium red, which to some extent may account\r\nfor the less erect habit of growth which characterizes it. The leaves\r\nare usually destitute of the white spot found on those of the other\r\nvariety. The heads are also probably larger and somewhat more open, but\r\nthere is no appreciable difference in the size of the seed. The plants,\r\nnotwithstanding, bear so much resemblance to those of the common red\r\nvariety that it is not easy to distinguish them unless by the large size\r\nof the plants of the former. The roots are larger and stronger than\r\nthose of the medium red variety, and as a result have more power to\r\ngather plant food in the soil.\r\n\r\nMammoth clover is biennial under some conditions and under others it is\r\nperennial, although it is not usually a long-lived perennial. It has a\r\nstronger habit of growth than the medium red, and is, therefore, rather\r\nbetter fitted to thrive under adverse conditions, more especially when\r\nit has once obtained a hold upon the soil. It grows chiefly in the first\r\nhalf of the season, and makes but little growth, relatively, in the\r\nautumn, or, indeed, any time the same season after the crop has been\r\nharvested for hay. In the Northern States it comes into flower about\r\nthe middle of July, and in those of the South correspondingly earlier.\r\n\r\nIt is relished by all kinds of domestic animals kept upon the farm, but\r\nthe hay is relatively better adapted to cows and other cattle than to\r\nhorses and sheep. If cut too late, or much injured in the curing, it is\r\ntoo dusty for horses, and the growth is too coarse to make first-class\r\nhay for sheep. It makes excellent soiling food, because of the abundance\r\nof the growth and the considerable season during which it may be fed in\r\nthe green form.\r\n\r\nIt is peculiarly valuable as a fertilizer and as an improver of soils.\r\nIn addition to the nitrogen which it draws from the air and deposits in\r\nthe soil, it brings up plant food from the subsoil and stores it in the\r\nleaves and stems, so that when fed it can be returned to the land. It\r\nalso fills the soil with an abundance of roots and rootlets. These\r\nrender stiff soils more friable, and sandy soils less porous; they\r\nincrease the power of all soils to hold moisture, and in their decay\r\nyield up a supply of plant food already prepared for the crops that are\r\nnext grown upon the ground.\r\n\r\nMammoth clover may also be utilized with advantage in lessening the\r\nnumbers of certain noxious weeds, and in some instances of eradicating\r\nthem altogether. This it does in some instances by smothering them,\r\nthrough the rankness of the growth. In other instances it is brought\r\nabout through the setback which is given to the weeds by first pasturing\r\nthe crop and then cutting it later for seed.\r\n\r\n=Distribution.=--Mammoth clover has long been grown in several of the\r\ncountries of Europe and Western Asia. It is also grown in certain parts\r\nof Siberia. It was doubtless introduced into the United States from\r\nEurope by emigrants from that continent, but when exactly is not known.\r\nIt has probably been many years since its introduction into America, but\r\nit is only within the more recent of the decades that it has attracted\r\ngeneral notice. In some areas in this country it grows with great\r\nluxuriance, fully equaling, if not exceeding, the crops grown in any\r\npart of Europe.\r\n\r\nMammoth clover calls for climatic conditions about the same as those for\r\nmedium red clover. (See page 61.) It flourishes best in moist climates\r\nof moderate temperature, and it will endure more drought than the medium\r\nred variety and possibly more cold.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of mammoth clover covers nearly all the States of the\r\nUnion, but as with medium red clover the adaptation for it is relatively\r\nhigher in the Northern than in the Southern States of the Union. The\r\nhighest adaptation for mammoth clover is probably found in certain parts\r\nof Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, the northern valleys of the Rocky\r\nMountain States, the elevated portions of those further south and the\r\ncountry around Puget Sound. The adaptation is also high in much of New\r\nYork, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska. In\r\nthe Southern States that lie northward, good crops may be grown in some\r\nlocations, but not in all. As the semi-arid belt is approached, mammoth\r\nclover will grow further west than the medium red, but in the greater\r\nportion of this region it will not succeed. The adaptation of the North\r\nAtlantic States, including those of New England, is not of a high order,\r\nbut rather more so, probably, than for the medium red.\r\n\r\nIn Canada also the adaptation of medium and mammoth clover is much the\r\nsame as for the medium red. In some parts of Ontario, especially Western\r\nOntario, it grows remarkably well; but in the maritime provinces it does\r\nnot grow so well; nor does it thrive in the provinces of the Canadian\r\nNorthwest as it does in Ontario.\r\n\r\nAs with medium red clover, the distribution of this variety has not been\r\nfully determined in either the United States or Canada, more especially\r\non soils of the prairie, where it does not succeed well at present. It\r\nis probable that under some conditions on these soils, and also in the\r\nSouth, the absence of the requisite bacteria in the soil may account, in\r\npart, at least, for failure in attempts made to grow it. With the\r\nintroduction of these, the area of successful cultivation may be\r\nconsiderably extended.\r\n\r\n=Soils.=--Mammoth clover may usually be successfully grown in soils well\r\nadapted to the growth of the medium red variety. (See page 65.) This\r\nmeans that it will usually grow with much luxuriance in all areas which\r\nproduce hardwood timber, and are usually covered with a clay or muddy\r\nloam soil underlaid with clay. It will also grow with great luxuriance\r\nin the volcanic ash soils of the irrigated valley lands of the Rocky\r\nMountain States, and in the loam and light loam soils of the Puget\r\nSound country. It has greater power than the common red variety to grow\r\nin stiff clays, in sandy soils underlaid with clay, and in areas where\r\nmoisture is insufficient near the surface soil. In stiff clays the roots\r\npenetrate to a greater distance than those of the medium red variety and\r\ngather more food. Consequently, a stiff clay soil that would only\r\nfurnish a light crop of the medium red variety in a dry season may\r\nfurnish an excellent crop of the mammoth. The quality of the hay is\r\nlikely to be superior to that grown on soils altogether congenial, since\r\nit is not likely to be over-rank or coarse.\r\n\r\nOn sandy soils underlaid with clay, and especially where the clay is\r\nsome distance from the surface, this clover is more certain to make a\r\nstand, since the vigor of the plants enables them to gather food until\r\nthe roots go down into the clay.\r\n\r\nIn areas where the moisture is more or less deficient, the other\r\nconditions being favorable, this clover can send its roots down into the\r\nsubsoil, where moisture is more abundant than on the surface. Because of\r\nthis power, it is better adapted than the medium red to much of the area\r\nof Southwestern Minnesota, Western Iowa, Western Kansas and Nebraska,\r\nand, in fact, much of the area bordering on the semi-arid country.\r\n\r\nOn clay soils that are so saturated with water that in the winter or\r\nspring the clover is much liable to heave, there is conflict in opinion\r\nas to whether the mammoth or the common red variety will heave the more\r\nreadily, but the preponderance of the evidence favors the view that the\r\nroots of the mammoth variety can better resist such influences than\r\nthose of the common red.\r\n\r\nThis clover, like the common red, is not well adapted to hungry, sandy\r\nsoils, to the blow soils of the prairie, to the muck soils of the watery\r\nslough, or to the peaty soils of the drained muskeg.\r\n\r\n=Place in the Rotation.=--The place for mammoth clover in the rotation\r\nis much the same as for the medium red variety. (See page 70.) It may,\r\ntherefore, be best sown on a clean soil; that is to say, on a soil which\r\nhas grown a crop the previous season that has called for clean\r\ncultivation, as, for instance, corn, potatoes, sorghum, or one or the\r\nother of the non-saccharine sorghums, field beans, soy beans, cow peas\r\nand field roots. But it is not so necessary that it shall be made to\r\nfollow either kind of beans or cow peas as the other crops named, since\r\nthese have already gathered nitrogen, which is more needed by leguminous\r\ncrops. This clover should rather be grown in rotations where more\r\nnitrogen is wanted, when the soil will profit by increased supplies of\r\nhumus, and where strong plants are wanted, the root growth of which will\r\nhave the effect of rendering the cultivated portion of the soil more\r\nfriable when stiff and more retentive when sandy, and that will have the\r\neffect of opening up many little channels in the subsoil when the roots\r\ndecay, through which an excess of surface water may percolate into the\r\nsubsoil. It may precede such crops as revel in humus and that feed\r\nravenously on nitrogen. These include all the small cereals, corn and\r\nall the sorghums, rape, and all kinds of garden vegetables and\r\nstrawberries. It is, of course, better adapted to short than to long\r\nrotations, because of the limited duration of the life of the plants.\r\n\r\nThe length of the rotation will, of course, depend upon various\r\ncontingencies. Frequently, the clover is cropped or pastured but one\r\nseason following the year on which the seed was sown, whatsoever the\r\ncharacter of the crops that precede or follow it, but in more instances,\r\nprobably, it is used as crop or pasture for two years. When timothy is\r\nsown along with this clover the pasturing or cropping may continue for\r\none or more seasons longer before the ground is broken, but in such\r\ninstances the timothy will have consumed much or all of the nitrogen put\r\ninto the soil by the clover, save what has escaped in the drainage\r\nwater. One of the best rotations in which to sow mammoth clover, as also\r\nthe medium red, is the following: Sow in a nurse crop of rye, wheat,\r\noats or barley, as the case may be, in order that it may be pastured or\r\ncut for hay the following season, and then follow with a crop of corn or\r\npotatoes. This in turn is followed by one or another of the small\r\ngrains. This constitutes a three years' rotation, but in the case of\r\nmammoth clover it is frequently lengthened to four years. The year\r\nfollowing the sowing of the clover, it is cut for hay or for seed, and\r\nthe next year it is pastured with or without a top-dressing of farmyard\r\nmanure. This rotation meets with considerable favor in certain areas of\r\nWisconsin, well adapted to the growth of the plant.\r\n\r\n=Preparing the Soil.=--The preparation of the soil called for by the\r\nmammoth clover is virtually the same as that required when preparing a\r\nseed-bed for the medium red variety. (See page 74.) Clay loam soils,\r\nwhatsoever their color, cannot easily be made too fine and smooth, and\r\nthe same is true of sandy loams. Stiff clays should be made so fine as\r\nto contain ample loose mold to germinate the seed readily, and yet they\r\nought not to be made so fine that they will readily run together under\r\nthe influence of a soaking rain. Usually, such soils are seldom made too\r\nfine, but sometimes they are. The aim should be to firm sandy soils,\r\nespecially when light enough to lift with the wind, and to leave them\r\nmore or less uneven on the surface when the seed is sown.\r\n\r\nIn many States the ground should be plowed in the fall for spring\r\nsowing, and in yet others it should be plowed in the spring. Conditions\r\nof soil and climate govern this feature of the work. Usually, however,\r\nthe longer the soil is plowed and then properly worked on the surface\r\nbefore receiving the seed, the finer, cleaner, firmer and moister it is\r\nlikely to be, and the larger the store of the available fertility to\r\npromote the growth of the young plants. Because of this, after\r\ncultivated crops, the ground is not usually plowed or otherwise stirred\r\non the surface.\r\n\r\nWhen the soil is low in fertility, it may be necessary to fertilize it\r\nbefore a crop of mammoth clover can be successfully grown. For such\r\nfertilization, farmyard manure is very suitable. When soils are low in\r\nthe content of humus, before a good crop of clover can be grown, it may\r\nbe necessary to supply humus. But few soils are so deficient in\r\nfertility that they will not grow clover if supplied with humus.\r\nFarmyard manure supplies both humus and fertility, but in its absence, a\r\ncrop of rye buried in the soil will insure a stand of clover. In other\r\ninstances it may be necessary to follow with some kind of a crop that\r\nhas much power to gather plant food, as corn of some hardy variety, and\r\nto graze or otherwise feed it from the land.\r\n\r\n=Sowing.=--Much of what has been said about the sowing of medium red\r\nclover will apply also to the sowing of mammoth clover. East of the\r\nMississippi and north of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, mammoth clover is\r\nusually sown in the spring, and for the reason that the young plants are\r\nfrequently killed by the severity of the winter weather when sown in the\r\nautumn. But when sown at that season, the seed being mixed with winter\r\nrye and being deposited by the drill as early as September 1st, the\r\nplants frequently survive the winter as far north as Marquette County in\r\nWisconsin. The rye in the line of the drill marks provides a sufficient\r\nprotection for the clover. But this only occurs where the conditions are\r\neminently favorable to the growth of the clover. Around Puget Sound it\r\nmay also be sown with advantage in the early autumn, as then it should\r\nproduce a full crop the next season, and the same is true of nearly all\r\nthe Rocky Mountain valley region, but in these areas it may also be sown\r\nin the spring. Between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains and\r\nOklahoma and Canada, spring sowing is usually preferable, and in much of\r\nthe area is an absolute necessity to insure a stand. In the South the\r\nseed may be sown fall or spring; which season is to be preferred should\r\nbe determined chiefly by the character of the soil. On soil much given\r\nto heaving in the winter it is usually preferable to sow in the spring.\r\nIn all, or nearly all, parts of Canada spring sowing only is admissible.\r\n\r\nWhen the seed is sown in the early spring, it should usually be sown\r\nquite early, as early, in fact, as the ground is in condition to receive\r\nthe seed when the nurse crop has been sown the previous autumn. When the\r\nground is smooth and impacted on the surface, it is considered\r\npreferable to defer sowing until the ground is dry enough to admit of\r\ncovering the seed with the harrow. When deposited at the same time as\r\nspring-sown nurse crops, and with these, the time of sowing will be\r\ndetermined by the most suitable time for sowing the nurse crop. This\r\nplant may be sown under certain conditions as late in the spring as\r\nmoisture exists in the soil sufficient to produce vigorous germination\r\nin the seed. This means that it may be sown as late as June, if sown\r\nalone, and even later. When sown thus late it should be on soil that has\r\nbeen well cleaned near the surface. When sown in the autumn, as with\r\nmedium red clover, the aim should be to put the seed in as early as the\r\narrival of the autumn rains, that the plants may be well rooted before\r\nthe arrival of freezing weather.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, mammoth clover, like the medium red, is sown with a nurse\r\ncrop, whether sown fall or spring. (See page 84.) The nurse crops in the\r\nNorth include winter rye, winter wheat, barley, spring wheat and oats,\r\nsuitable, probably, in the order named, also such pasture crops as rape,\r\nvetches, and various mixtures of grain sown on certain soils to provide\r\npasture for cattle, sheep or swine. The best nurse crops in the South\r\ninclude winter rye, winter barley and winter oats, even though the seed\r\nshould not be sown on them until the spring. On certain sandy loam soils\r\na stand of mammoth clover is more assured if sown with a pasture crop\r\nthan if sown with a grain crop which is to mature. (See page 82.) Under\r\ncertain conditions of soil and climate, this crop may be sown on plowed\r\nor disked land in certain of the States, after a crop of grain, and in\r\nother instances by sowing amid the stubbles and covering with the\r\nharrow. But there is more of hazard in growing thus than by other\r\nmethods. Sometimes this clover is sown amid standing corn, at the last\r\ncultivation, but too much shade or too little moisture may cause only\r\npartial success, or even failure, whereas at other times the plan may\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nThe modes of sowing the clover are virtually the same as those to be\r\nfollowed in sowing medium red clover. (See page 78.) It will be sown by\r\nhand, by hand machines, and by the grain drill, with or without\r\nattachments. The seed of this variety, however, will, on the whole, be\r\nmore frequently mixed in with the grain than the seed of the medium red\r\nclover, because of the stronger growth that it makes. This will\r\nfrequently be found the preferable mode of sowing it when sown in the\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\nWhen sown to provide hay, mammoth clover and timothy make an excellent\r\ncombination for the reasons, first, that they mature about the same\r\ntime; second, that more of this clover is likely to survive the first\r\nyear of cutting than of the common red; and third, that more food, it is\r\nbelieved, will be furnished to the timothy in the dead roots of this\r\nclover than of the medium red. The first year of cutting, the hay crop\r\nis likely to be nearly all clover; the second year, clover and timothy\r\nmixed, and the third year, timothy. But if alsike is sown in the\r\nmixture, though it may be little in evidence the first year, it will\r\nshow itself the second year and probably the third year. When sown for\r\npasture in short rotations, this clover may be sown alone or with other\r\nvarieties of clover, timothy or tall oat grass being added. When sown\r\nfor seed, it is probably better to sow it alone, but there is no very\r\nstrong objection to sowing timothy alone with the clover, since the\r\nlatter may aid in sustaining the clover, and it is not difficult to\r\nseparate mammoth clover seed and timothy seed.\r\n\r\nWhen mammoth clover is sown alone for hay or for seed, not fewer than 12\r\npounds per acre of seed should be used. When sown with timothy, 6 and 8\r\npounds, respectively, would be an average seeding. If alsike clover is\r\nadded, the seed of the mammoth may be reduced by one pound, and the same\r\namount of alsike added to the mixture. When sown with the medium red\r\nvariety to provide short rotation pastures, about 6 pounds of each may\r\nbe sown. The pasture furnished will be more continuous than where only\r\none kind is sown. If timothy or tall oat grass is added, a pound of one\r\nor the other of these should be added for every pound of the clover\r\nwithheld from the mixture. For permanent pastures 6 pounds of the\r\nmammoth clover may be set down as the maximum to sow per acre, varying\r\nthe quantity with varying conditions. And when the clover is sown with\r\nsmall grain to be plowed under in the fall or early in the spring,\r\nusually only very moderate amounts of seed ought to be used, especially\r\nwhere the hazard is considerable that the dry weather may cause failure\r\nin the catch of the seed.\r\n\r\n=Pasturing.=--Mammoth clover furnishes much pasture when it is grazed,\r\non into July and sometimes even into August, because of the vigorous\r\ncharacter of the growth, but after that season the growth is usually\r\nlight. Nor is there generally much growth after the crop has been cut\r\nfor hay. The palatability of the pasture is much the same as that of the\r\nmedium red variety. More grazing is furnished where the crop is fairly\r\nwell grown before the pasturing begins, but it is not so palatable, and\r\nwhen unduly rank, to defer pasturing thus long would result in a\r\nconsiderable waste of pasture, which the stock would tread under foot.\r\nWhen the crop is wanted for hay, there may be instances in which it may\r\nbe advantageous to pasture it for a time to prevent the growth from\r\nbecoming overly luxuriant. There have been instances in which the\r\nclover has grown so rankly that the lodged clover killed nearly all the\r\nplants by excluding the air from the roots. When grown on soils that in\r\na normal season produce a rank growth, the quality of the hay will, in\r\nnearly all instances, be improved by grazing. This, however, should be\r\ndone soon after the growth begins and should not be long continued, and\r\nit should be close, in order to promote evenness and uniformity in the\r\ngrowth of the hay crop.\r\n\r\nWhen grown for seed, mammoth clover is quite frequently pastured. In\r\nfact, in a majority of instances it is either pastured or cut with the\r\nmower when a seed crop is wanted. The pasturing usually continues until\r\nJune 1st, but in some instances it is prolonged far on into June. The\r\nduration of the pasturing season should be gauged largely by the\r\ncharacter of the soil and weather. The better the conditions for growth\r\nin the plants, the longer may the pasturing be continued, and _vice\r\nversa_. There are also conditions in which such pasturing may not be\r\nnecessary. But when the grazing is not close, the mower should be run\r\nover the field, otherwise the seeds will not ripen evenly.\r\n\r\nThere is the same danger from bloating that is present when pasturing\r\nmedium red clover. (See page 94.) To avoid this danger, cattle that are\r\nbeing thus pastured are in some instances given access to cured clover\r\nhay. In other instances the haulm of the seed is left in the field so\r\nthat the cattle have access to it. But the second season of grazing, the\r\ndanger from bloat is not so great as the first season, as usually more\r\nof other pasture plants grow amid the clover.\r\n\r\nHorses, cattle, sheep or swine may be used in grazing off the clover for\r\nseed. All of these may be used at the same time. Horses bite the crowns\r\nof the plants so closely as to somewhat injure subsequent growth; sheep\r\nalso crop rather closely; cattle do not crop the plants so closely;\r\nconsequently, they are so far preferable to horses or sheep for such\r\ngrazing. On the other hand, sheep will prove far more destructive to\r\nweed growth in the pasture.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting for Hay.=--Ordinarily, the methods of making the hay crop\r\nare the same as those followed in curing medium red clover. The mammoth\r\nvariety, however, frequently requires a longer season in which to cure,\r\nowing, first, to the heavier character of the growth, and second, to the\r\nlarger stems of the latter. After it has been mown there is greater\r\nreason for using the tedder in getting it ready for being raked, and it\r\ncalls for more curing before it is put into cocks. The larger the\r\nproportion of the timothy in the crop, the more easily it is cured. It\r\nis ready for cutting when in full bloom, and loses more than the medium\r\nred when cutting is too long deferred, because of the larger proportion\r\nof coarse stems in the crop. It is also relatively more injured by rain\r\nin the cocks, since it sheds rain even less readily than the medium red\r\nclover, and the same is true of it in the stack.\r\n\r\nSome farmers cure mammoth clover in its green form in the mow as they\r\nalso cure the medium red variety, but the same objections apply to\r\ncuring it thus that apply to the similar curing of the medium red. (See\r\npage 102.) Others cure it in the mow by storing good bright straw,\r\npreferably oat straw, in alternate layers along with the clover. From\r\none-third to one-half the quantity of the straw as compared with the hay\r\nwill suffice for such curing, varying with the degree of the wilting in\r\nthe hay. Clover cut in the morning after the dew has lifted may be thus\r\nstored the same day. Where the facilities are present such a method of\r\ncuring mammoth clover may be eminently wise in showery weather. The\r\nnatural color of the hay and blossoms is thus preserved and the straw is\r\neaten with avidity, because of what it has imbibed from the clover.\r\n\r\n=Securing Seed.=--It has been already intimated more seed will be\r\nobtained when the clover has been pastured or cut back with the mower.\r\n(See page 233.) When the mower is used, it should not be set to cut\r\nquite low, or the subsequent growth will not be so vigorous as it would\r\notherwise be. The state of growth at which the clover ought to be cut\r\nwill be influenced by the luxuriance of the growth, but ordinarily\r\nclover seed should not be more than 6 to 8 inches high when the mower is\r\nused. What is thus cut by the mower is left on the ground as a mulch.\r\nMowing the crop thus will also be helpful in destroying weeds, but some\r\nweeds will sprout again and mature seed as quickly as the clover.\r\n\r\nWhen mammoth clover is neither pastured nor mown early in the season,\r\nwhen grown for seed some kinds of weeds may be prevented from going to\r\nseed in it by cutting them off with the scythe. When not too plentiful\r\nthey may be removed with the spud. Among the more troublesome weeds that\r\ninfest mammoth clover are the Canada thistle (_Cirsium arvense_), the\r\nplantain (_Plantago lanceolata_), and in some instances the horse nettle\r\n(_Solanum Carolinense_) and spring nightshade (_Solanum_).\r\n\r\nThe yields of the clover seed will be much influenced by the character\r\nof the weather. Excessive rankness in the crop and excessive rainfall\r\nduring the blossoming season are adverse to abundant seed production.\r\nBut the seed crop is more injured by drought than by too much rain. When\r\ninjured by drought the growth will not be sufficiently strong, or, if it\r\nis, the blossoms will be of a pale red tint. Warm winds while the seed\r\nis forming are also adverse to seed production, since they cause the\r\ncrop to mature too quickly. Some experience will enable the capable\r\nobserver to forecast with no little certainty the probable yield of the\r\nseed. If the indications point to a yield of seed less than 2 bushels\r\nper acre, it is deemed more profitable, as a rule, to cut the crop for\r\nhay. Large heads of a rich dark purple shade accompanied by vigor in the\r\nentire plant are indicative of abundant seed production.\r\n\r\nThe crop is ready for being harvested when a majority of the heads have\r\nripened so far that the bloom on them is all gone and the shade of color\r\nin the head has not yet become brown. If left until a majority of the\r\nheads are brown many of them will break off while being harvested. The\r\ncrop is usually cut with a self-rake reaper, but it may be cut with a\r\nmower. When cut by either method the sheaves should be made small, so\r\nthat they will dry out quickly.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the crop shall be threshed before it is rained on,\r\nas one thorough wetting will so far bedim the attractive brightness as\r\ncompared with seed that has not been rained on that it will considerably\r\ndiscount the price that would otherwise be obtained for it. It is\r\nusually threshed with a huller, but may also be threshed like the medium\r\nred variety by a grain separator with a suitable attachment.\r\n\r\nThe yields of the seed vary much. Instances are on record where as much\r\nas 11 or 12 bushels per acre have been reaped, but ordinarily even on\r\ngood producing soils the yields are not more than 4 to 5 bushels per\r\nacre, and under ordinary conditions for the production of mammoth clover\r\nthey are even less than the amount named. Notwithstanding the greater\r\nstrength of the plants, the seeds are apparently no larger than those of\r\nthe medium red variety, nor can they be distinguished from them unless\r\nby an expert.\r\n\r\n=Renewing.=--Much that has been said with reference to the renewing of\r\nmedium red clover will apply equally to the renewing of the mammoth.\r\n(See page 109.) Where seed crops are much grown, the soil becomes so\r\nimpregnated with the seed that more or less of the plants will appear\r\nany season. Renewal in the South is more important, relatively, than in\r\nthe North, as under some conditions the plants survive for a longer\r\nperiod in Southern soils.\r\n\r\n=Compared with Medium Red Clover.=--1. The mammoth is larger and coarser\r\nthan the medium red and is considerably less erect in its habit of\r\ngrowth. It has larger and longer roots; hence, it goes down more deeply\r\ninto the subsoil in search of food.\r\n\r\n2. It is, on the whole, longer lived than the medium red variety and has\r\ngreater power to grow in a sandy soil and under conditions in which\r\nmoisture is not plentiful.\r\n\r\n3. It provides more pasture than the medium red variety during the early\r\npart of the season, but not so much after harvest, the season of growth\r\nbeing less continuous then than with the former.\r\n\r\n4. The hay which it furnishes is usually considerably more bulky and\r\ncoarse, and because of this it is not so highly prized by stock.\r\n\r\n5. It blooms about three weeks later than the medium red variety and\r\nremains a little longer in bloom and seeds more freely, but can only be\r\ncut once in a season.\r\n\r\n6. It furnishes more green food for plowing under than the medium red;\r\nhence, it is, on the whole, a better improver of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCRIMSON CLOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson Clover (_Trifolium incarnatum_) is also known by the names\r\nFrench, German, German Mammoth, Italian, Egyptian and Carnation clover.\r\nIn America it is common in certain areas to speak of it as winter\r\nclover, from the greater powers of growth which it possesses at that\r\nseason as compared with other clovers.\r\n\r\nThe plants have an erect habit of growth, and yet they are soft and\r\nhairy, and they have much power to stool. More than 100 stems have been\r\nproduced by one plant, but under conditions the most favorable. The\r\nleaves are numerous. The heads are oblong, cylindrical, and considerably\r\ncone-shaped, and are from 1 to 2 inches long, and much larger than those\r\nof medium red clover. The bloom is scarlet or crimson and of the richest\r\ndye; hence, a more beautiful sight is seldom seen than that of a\r\nvigorous crop of crimson clover in full bloom. The average height of the\r\nplants may be put at about 18 inches, but they have been grown to the\r\nheight of 3 and even 4 feet. The root growth is fully twice that of the\r\nstems. The roots are strong, go down straight into the soil, and are to\r\nsome extent branched.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is an annual, although usually the growth covers a part\r\nof two years. Sown in the summer or early autumn, growth is completed\r\nby the advent of the following summer. It is, therefore, pre-eminently a\r\ncatch crop, and because of this, when conditions admit of it, serves a\r\npurpose in American agriculture, which can be served by none of the\r\nother varieties of clover that are now grown. It has much power to grow\r\nin cool weather, when the clovers are practically dormant. It does not\r\ncease to grow until the ground has become frozen, and as soon as the\r\nfrost leaves the soil growth begins at once; hence, the greater relative\r\nvalue this plant has for areas in which the winters are mild.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Crimson Clover (_Trifolium incarnatum_)\r\n  Tennessee Experiment Station]\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is much relished by farm animals, whether used as\r\npasture, soiling food, silage or hay. Under some conditions it may be\r\npastured autumn and spring, and even through much of the winter. As a\r\nsoiling plant, its value is high, not only because it is a legume, but\r\nbecause it comes in season at a time when it may be fed with winter rye\r\nused as soiling. But the period is short during which it furnishes\r\nsoiling food. Its value as hay will always be lessened by the difficulty\r\nin curing it so early in the season, and because of the danger from\r\nfeeding it to horses when cut at a too advanced stage of growth. It is\r\nmuch in favor for furnishing chicken pasture in winter.\r\n\r\nAs a catch crop crimson clover may be made to do duty in seasons in\r\nwhich other clover crops may have failed. As a cover crop or a mulch for\r\norchards, it is in high favor, as the growth which it produces protects\r\nthe roots of the same. But its greatest use lies in the beneficial\r\ninfluence which it exerts upon soils by enriching them and also\r\nimproving their mechanical condition. It is likely, therefore, to be\r\ngrown more for this purpose than for any other. While growing it in many\r\ninstances will not render unnecessary the use of commercial fertilizers,\r\nit will greatly reduce the quantity of these that would otherwise be\r\nnecessary. Owing to the season at which it is grown, it will be found\r\nquite helpful in destroying weeds.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of crimson clover has thus far been somewhat erratic, even\r\nin areas where the conditions are looked upon as generally favorable to\r\nits growth. The opinions of practical men differ much with reference to\r\nits value. There have been many instances of success and failure in the\r\nsame locality, and even in the experience of the same individual. These\r\nvaried experiences are doubtless due in a considerable degree to a\r\ndifference in seasons, to want of acclimation in the seed sown, to a\r\ndifference in varieties and to want of knowledge on the part of the\r\ngrowers, whose work, heretofore, has been largely tentative. Five\r\ndifferent varieties have been grown, and these have not shown equal\r\ndegrees of hardiness. But the rapidly increasing sales of seed point to\r\nthe conclusion that larger areas are being sown every year. The increase\r\nreferred to may be expected to grow greater for many years to come;\r\nsince, when the needs of the plant are better understood, the failures\r\nwill be fewer.\r\n\r\n=Distribution.=--Crimson clover is probably indigenous to certain parts\r\nof Europe, especially to the countries that lie southwest and south. It\r\nhas been grown to a considerable extent in France, Germany and Italy.\r\nThe name Egyptian would seem also to imply that it is grown in Egypt. It\r\nis not grown to any considerable extent north and west in Europe, owing,\r\nprobably, to the too severe conditions of climate which characterize\r\nthese. It is not indigenous to America, but was probably introduced from\r\nEurope two or three decades ago. Its late introduction accounts for the\r\nfact that its adaptation in some parts of the United States is as yet\r\ncontroverted.\r\n\r\nThis plant needs a climate rather mild and decidedly moist. It cannot\r\nwithstand severe freezing when the ground is bare; hence, its uniformly\r\nsuccessful growth cannot be relied on very far north of the Ohio and\r\nPotomac rivers. True, in certain winters of much snowfall it has come\r\nthrough in good form considerably north of the rivers mentioned, but in\r\nmore instances it has failed. On the other hand, while it grows best in\r\nwarm climates, the growth in these is made chiefly when the weather is\r\ncool, as in the autumn and spring, and in some instances in the winter.\r\nIt would be about correct to say that the climatic adaptation of this\r\nplant is nearly the same as that of the peach. Climates too cold for\r\nfruitage in the latter would be too cold for the uniformly safe\r\nwintering of crimson clover. It would also seem correct to state that on\r\nsuitable soils and with sufficient precipitation, this clover will do\r\nbest in the United States when the climate is too warm for the medium\r\nred clover to grow at its best. In the United States, soil and climatic\r\nconditions taken together, would probably give Delaware, New Jersey,\r\nMaryland, Virginia and Tennessee highest adaptation for the growth of\r\nthis plant. Taking in a wide area, highest adaptation would lie in the\r\nStates south of the Potomac and Ohio rivers and east of the Mississippi.\r\nWashington and Oregon, west to the Cascade Mountains, would probably\r\nfurnish exceptions, but in these the necessity for growing crimson\r\nclover is not likely to be so great as in the area just referred to,\r\nowing to the ease with which other varieties of clover may be grown. In\r\nsome parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan many farmers\r\nhave succeeded well in growing crimson clover, but a larger number have\r\nfailed. The failures have arisen largely through dry weather in the\r\nautumn, want of plant food in the soil and the severity of the winter\r\nweather. Westward from these States to the Mississippi, the adaptation\r\nis still lower, and the same is true of the New England States. In fact,\r\nit is so low in these that it is far more likely that it will fail than\r\nthat it will succeed. Between the Mississippi and the Cascade Mountains,\r\ncrimson clover is not likely to be much grown. It will not grow well in\r\nany part of the semi-arid belt. In the mountain valleys it would\r\nprobably succeed, but in these alfalfa and some other varieties of\r\nclover will give far better returns.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover will not grow well in any part of Canada, except in that\r\nnarrow strip of land between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific. The\r\nwinter climate is too cold for it. Some crops have been grown\r\nsuccessfully in the peach-producing areas of Ontario contiguous to Lakes\r\nErie and Ontario, but even in these it is an uncertain crop. The attempt\r\nhas been made to grow it in some of the provinces of Canada, and in\r\nseveral of the States, by sowing the seed in the spring. Some fairly\r\ngood crops have been thus obtained, but usually not so good as can be\r\ngrown by sowing certain other varieties of clover at the same season. It\r\nis but reasonable to expect, however, that adaptation in growing crimson\r\nclover will widen with the acclimation of the plant, and with increasing\r\nknowledge as to its needs on the part of those who grow it.\r\n\r\n=Soils.=--Crimson clover though usually grown for the enrichment of\r\nsoils will not, as a rule, make satisfactory growth on soils very low in\r\nthe elements of fertility, whatsoever may be their composition or\r\ntexture. On orchard lands liberally fertilized, in the Middle Atlantic\r\nStates, excellent crops have been obtained, whereas on adjacent soils\r\nprecisely similar they have failed. In the Southern States, however,\r\nbetter results, relatively, will be obtained from sowing this clover on\r\ncomparatively infertile lands, owing to the longer season which it has\r\nfor continuous growth. Where the winters are possessed of considerable\r\nseverity and when the protection of snow is more or less wanting, unless\r\nthe plants are strong when they enter the winter, they are almost\r\ncertain to perish. Loam soils with reasonably porous subsoils are best\r\nadapted to its growth. Of these, sandy loams have a higher adaptation\r\nthan clay loams, when equal to the former in fertility, as in the latter\r\nthe plants can more quickly gather the needed food supplies, since the\r\nroots and rootlets can penetrate them more readily. Such soils are well\r\nadapted to the growth of orchards, especially peach orchards, and it is\r\nin such areas that crimson clover has been grown with highest success.\r\nIn the alfalfa soils of the Rocky Mountain valleys it should also grow\r\nwell, but on these it would be less profitable to grow than alfalfa,\r\nbecause of the permanency of the alfalfa. Even on sandy soils a good\r\ngrowth will be obtained when these have been fertilized and sufficient\r\nmoisture is present. On stiff clays the growth is too slow to produce\r\ncrops highly satisfactory either North or South, and in dry weather it\r\nis also difficult to obtain a stand of the plants. The alluvial soils of\r\nriver bottoms in the South produce good crops. The vegetable soils of\r\nthe prairie do not grow the plants very well, and the adaptation in\r\nslough or swamp soils is even lower. Good crops will not be obtained on\r\nsoils underlaid with hardpan which comes up near the surface, whatsoever\r\nthe nature of the top soil may be, since the roots cannot penetrate\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n=Place in the Rotation.=--It cannot be said of crimson clover, in the\r\nordinary usage of the word, that it is a rotation plant. It has probably\r\nno fixed place in any regular rotation, and yet it can be used almost\r\nanywhere in the rotation that may be desired, and in any rotation\r\nwhether long or short, regular or irregular. As previously intimated, it\r\nis usually grown as a catch crop, and primarily to fertilize the land;\r\nand since its growth is chiefly or entirely made in the late summer,\r\nautumn, winter and early spring, that is to say, when the land is not\r\notherwise occupied, the only hindrances to using it anywhere in the\r\nrotation are such as arise from the nature of the weather, the\r\nmechanical condition of the land and the needs of the crops that are to\r\nfollow. For instance, at the usual season for sowing it, the weather may\r\nbe so dry as to preclude the hope of successful germination in the seed.\r\nThis influence may also make it impossible to bring the land into that\r\nmechanical condition which makes a good seed-bed without undue labor,\r\nand ordinarily it would not be necessary to have crimson clover precede\r\nanother leguminous crop; since the latter, under many conditions, can\r\nsecure its own supply of nitrogen. To this there may be some exceptions.\r\nThere may be instances, as on light, porous and leechy soils, when it\r\nmight be proper to grow crimson clover as an aid in securing a stand of\r\nthe medium red variety, or in growing a crop of peas for the summer\r\nmarket. Ordinarily, however, this crop is grown to increase the supply\r\nof plant food in the soil for crops which require nitrogen, and to give\r\nsoils more or less porous, increased power to hold moisture and applied\r\nfertilizers. It is probably seldom grown to improve the mechanical\r\ncondition of stiff soils, since on these it grows slowly. Some other\r\nplants can do this more effectively. It is pre-eminently the catch crop\r\nfor the orchardist and the market gardener, and yet it may be made the\r\ncatch crop also of the farmer, under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover may be made to follow any crop, but it is seldom\r\nnecessary to have it follow another leguminous crop which has brought\r\nnitrogen to the soil. Nor is it usually sown after a grass crop which\r\nhas brought humus to the land. It is frequently sown after small cereal\r\ngrain crops that have been harvested. It may be made to follow any of\r\nthese. Sometimes it is sown in standing corn. But oftener than anywhere\r\nelse probably, it is sown in orchards and on soils from which early\r\npotatoes and garden vegetables have been removed.\r\n\r\nIt is peculiarly fitted for being grown in orchards. In these it may be\r\ngrown from year to year. It may be thus grown not only to gather\r\nnitrogen for the trees, but to make them more clean than they would\r\notherwise be when the fruit is being gathered, to protect the roots of\r\nthe trees in winter and to aid in the retention of moisture when plowed\r\nunder. But this plant may also, with peculiar fitness, be made to\r\nprecede late garden crops. It may be plowed under sufficiently early to\r\nadmit of this, and when so buried it aids in making a fine seed-bed,\r\nsince the roots promote friability in the land. When grown under what\r\nmay be termed strictly farm conditions, it usually precedes a cultivated\r\ncrop, as potatoes, corn, or one of the sorghums. It is equally suitable\r\nin fitting the soil for the growth of vine crops, such as melons,\r\nsquashes and pumpkins.\r\n\r\nBut in some localities this crop may be grown so as to break down the\r\nlines of old-time rotations, since in some instances it may be\r\nsuccessfully grown from year to year for several years without change.\r\nPotatoes and sweet corn, for instance, may be thus grown.\r\n\r\n=Preparing the Soil.=--In preparing the seed-bed for crimson clover, the\r\naim should be to secure fineness of pulverization near the surface and\r\nmoistness in the same. The former is greatly important, because of the\r\naid which it renders in securing the latter at a season when moisture is\r\noften lacking in the soil. As it is rather grown on soils deficient in\r\nhumus than on those plentifully supplied with the same, fineness in the\r\nseed-bed is not so important as it is with some classes of prairie\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nIn starting the seed, drought is the chief hindrance to be overcome in\r\nthe North, owing to the season at which the seed must be sown; hence,\r\nthe aim should be to begin preparing the seed-bed as long as possible\r\nbefore the sowing of the seed. The preparation called for will be\r\ninfluenced by the kind of soil, the crop last grown upon it and also the\r\nweather; hence, the process of preparing the seed-bed will vary. The\r\njudgment must determine whether the land should be plowed, or disked and\r\npulverized, or simply harrowed. After potatoes and other garden crops,\r\nharrowing may suffice; after certain grain crops on soils not too stiff,\r\ndisking may suffice; but where much trash is to be buried, plowing would\r\nbe necessary, and when the ground is at all cloddy, the roller should be\r\nfreely used. In corn fields the last cultivation will make a suitable\r\nseed-bed, and the same is sometimes true in cotton fields.\r\n\r\nTo grow good crops of crimson clover, it is necessary that there shall\r\nbe a considerable amount of plant food in the soil that is readily\r\navailable. Farmyard manure when it can be spared or secured will supply\r\nthe need. But the results will probably be more satisfactory where the\r\nmanure has been applied to the previous crop, as, for instance, to\r\npotatoes or corn, and for the reason, probably, that in the relatively\r\ndry season at which the seed of this plant is sown, the residue of the\r\nmanure still in the soil is more readily available than freshly applied\r\nmanure would be. Good crops have been grown on land thus manured, when\r\nat the same time seed sown on land under similar conditions and similar\r\nin other respects failed to give satisfactory yields.\r\n\r\nIn a majority of instances farmyard manure cannot be spared for such a\r\nuse. When it cannot, if necessary, commercial fertilizers may be\r\napplied. Those rich in phosphoric acid and potash are usually most\r\nneeded, but sometimes nitrogen also is necessary. When nitrogen is used,\r\nit may be best applied on the growing crop and while it is young.\r\nPhosphoric acid and potash may be fitly applied when the land is being\r\nprepared, and in a way that will incorporate them with the surface soil.\r\nThese may be used in the form of wood ashes, bone meal, Thomas' slag,\r\nKainit, sulphate or muriate of potash, South Carolina rock and acid\r\nphosphate. Acid phosphate and muriate of potash stand high in favor with\r\nsome growers when applied in the proportions of 9 and 1 parts and at the\r\nrate of, say, 200 pounds more or less per acre.\r\n\r\n=Sowing.=--The date for sowing crimson clover would seem to depend more\r\nupon latitude than upon any other influence. North of the Ohio River it\r\nshould seldom be sown later than September 1st, lest the growth of the\r\nplants should not be strong enough to endure the winter weather. Nor\r\nshould it be sown earlier than July 1st, lest the plants should reach\r\nthe blooming stage without having made a sufficient growth, an objection\r\nwhich applies to sowing earlier than July 1st in any part of the United\r\nStates. All things considered, August is the most favorable month for\r\nsowing the seed north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers. In the South,\r\nsowing at a later period is preferable. In the latitude of Tennessee,\r\nSeptember would usually prove more suitable for sowing than an earlier\r\ndate, and near the Gulf, October. But it may be sown earlier and later\r\nin these respective latitudes. It is a good time to sow the seed in much\r\nof the South when the autumn rains begin to come, and the same is true\r\nof the Puget Sound country.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be sown by hand, by the aid of hand machines, by some makes\r\nof grain drills in the same way as grain is sown, and by others with a\r\ngrass-seeder attachment. When sown by the latter, the seed should\r\nusually be allowed to fall before the grain tubes to aid in securing a\r\ncovering for it; the covering thus provided should be supplemented by\r\nadditional harrowing and in some instances rolling. When sown by hand or\r\nby hand machines on soils East and South, the roller should in many\r\ninstances follow and then the harrow, but on cloddy surfaces the harrow\r\nshould be used first and then the roller. No method of sowing the seed\r\nis more satisfactory than that which sows it by grain drills, which can\r\ndeposit it in the soil as grain is sown, as it is then buried at an even\r\ndepth. Sowing to a medium depth, say, 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches, is preferable\r\nto either extreme.\r\n\r\nWhether it is advisable to sow a nurse crop will depend upon conditions.\r\nWhen the seed is sown early, in hot weather the young plants are helped\r\nby more or less of shade. Such shade is usually provided by the other\r\nfactor or factors of the mixture. But when shade only is wanted from the\r\nnurse crop, a thin seeding of buckwheat has been found to answer. Melons\r\nand tomatoes have in some instances furnished shade satisfactorily, and\r\nin others upright growing varieties of cow peas or soy beans. The less\r\ncomplete the preparation of the seed-bed, the greater also is the\r\nnecessity for shade. In orchards the shade of the trees is usually\r\nample, and in some instances excessive. The same is true of vigorous\r\ncorn and cotton crops.\r\n\r\nWhether this clover should be sown alone or in mixtures will also depend\r\nupon conditions. If the crop is wanted solely for the enrichment of the\r\nland, it will usually be better to sow it alone, as crops other than\r\nlegumes do not bring as much fertility to the land. As a rule,\r\ntherefore, it should be sown alone in orchards. It should also, usually,\r\nbe sown alone for soiling crops and for hay, but in some instances for\r\nboth uses it may be sown with such crops as winter oats or winter\r\nvetches. On some soils, however, these will too much crowd the clover\r\nplants. On others the reverse will be true. For seed the crop should, of\r\ncourse, always be sown alone.\r\n\r\nFor pasture, crimson clover is sometimes sown with rape, winter rye,\r\nwinter oats, the common vetch or the sand vetch. When sown with rape,\r\nthe date of the sowing should be early. With the other crops named the\r\nmost suitable date for sowing the clover will usually prove the most\r\nsuitable also for sowing these.\r\n\r\nWhen sown alone, from 10 to 20 pounds of seed are used per acre. With\r\nall the conditions favorable, 12 to 15 pounds should suffice. When sown\r\nwith rape for pasture, 3 pounds of rape and 10 of the clover, or even a\r\nless quantity, should be enough. When sown with winter rye or winter\r\noats, about 1 bushel of each and 10 pounds of clover should suffice, and\r\nwhen sown with the common or the sand vetch, 1/2 bushel of either and 10\r\npounds of the clover should be enough. When sown in the chaff, from 2 to\r\n3 bushels ought to suffice, but the amount required will be much\r\naffected by the character of the seed crop.\r\n\r\n=Pasturing.=--Crimson clover may be pastured in the autumn or in the\r\nspring or at both seasons, either when sown alone, or in conjunction\r\nwith some other pasture crops, as winter rye, oats, barley or vetches.\r\nBut it is not probable that it will ever become so popular as some other\r\npasture plants that grow during the same seasons of the year; since,\r\nfirst, when it is grown, it is usually wanted for green manure; second,\r\nit does not under some conditions grow satisfactorily with other crops;\r\nand third, when grazed down in the autumn the covering thus removed\r\nrenders the plants much more liable to perish in the winter. When,\r\nhowever, it is sown early in the season, as in July, along with Dwarf\r\nEssex rape, or even alone, much grazing may be furnished, even though\r\nthe clover should not survive the winter.\r\n\r\nIt may be grazed by horses, mules, cattle, sheep or swine, but when\r\ngrazed with cattle and sheep, it is probable that some danger from hoven\r\nor bloat will be present, as when grazing other kinds of clover. (See\r\npage 94.) This danger, however, will be lessened, if not entirely\r\nremoved, when nurse crops are grown with the clover, except in the case\r\nof rape. The grazing should not begin when the plants are small, lest\r\nthe growth should be too much hindered at a season when growth is\r\ncritical.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting for Hay.=--Crimson clover is ready to be cut for hay when\r\ncoming into, and a little before it is in, fullest bloom. Some\r\nauthorities claim that it should be harvested when the blooms begin to\r\nappear. It should certainly not be allowed to pass the stage of full\r\nbloom, lest the hay when cured should prove hurtful to horses and\r\npossibly to other live stock, because of the presence of hair balls,\r\nwhich are then liable to form from the hairs so numerously found on this\r\nplant. These balls produce death by forming an impermeable wedge in the\r\nintestines of horses, thereby impeding and in some instances totally\r\narresting the process of digestion. These balls, almost circular in\r\nform, are composed of minute and rather stiff hairs, and several have\r\nbeen found in one animal. These hairs, numerous on the heads; do not\r\nstiffen sooner than the period of full bloom; hence, until that stage is\r\nreached in the growth of the plants, the danger from feeding cured hay\r\nmade from them does not occur.\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey and the neighboring States, crimson clover is ready for\r\nbeing cut sometimes in May earlier or later, as the season is early or\r\nlate. Further South it is fit to harvest earlier. At that season it is\r\nnot easily cured, since then rains are more frequent than in the\r\nordinary harvest season and the weather is less drying. Consequently,\r\nhay caps may frequently be used with much advantage by the growers of\r\nthis hay. (See page 98.)\r\n\r\nIt is harvested as other clover; that is, it is cut with the field\r\nmower, raked when wilted, put up into cocks, and left to stand in these\r\nuntil it has gone through the sweating process, when the cocks are\r\nopened out again on a bright day for a few hours prior to drawing them.\r\nThe tedder should be used freely in getting the hay ready to rake, as at\r\nthat season of the year it dries slowly.\r\n\r\n=Securing Seed.=--Crimson clover does not ripen quite so quickly after\r\nflowering as common red clover, owing, in part, at least, to the less\r\nintense character of the heat and drying influences at the season when\r\nit matures. Nevertheless, when it is ripe, unless it is cut with much\r\npromptness, the seed will shed much from the heads, and the heads will\r\nbreak off much during the curing process. If cut even two or three days\r\ntoo soon, the seeds will not be large and plump. Moreover, showery or\r\nmuggy weather will soon greatly injure the crop. One or two days of such\r\nweather after the crop has been cut will stain the seed; two or three\r\ndays of the same will cause much of the seed to sprout, and three or\r\nfour days will practically ruin the crop.\r\n\r\nBecause of the ease with which the seed sheds off the heads, it is\r\nbetter to cut the seed crop while it is a little damp, or at least to\r\nrefrain from cutting during the greatest heat of the day. In some\r\ninstances it is cut with the mower and raked early or late in the day,\r\nput up in small cocks and threshed from these in four or five days after\r\nbeing cut. But this method of harvesting, however carefully done, is\r\nattended with much loss of seed. It is better to harvest with the\r\nself-rake reaper, the rakes being so adjusted that the hay will be\r\ndropped off in small gavels or sheaves, so small that in two or three\r\ndays they may be lifted without being turned over; Much care should be\r\nexercised in lifting the sheaves to avoid shedding in the seed, and it\r\nshould be drawn on wagons with tight racks.\r\n\r\nWhile it is not absolutely necessary to thresh the seed crop at once,\r\nthe work can usually be done at that time with less outlay and with less\r\nloss of seed. It is threshed with a huller or with a grain separator\r\nwith suitable attachments. Some attention must be given to the\r\narrangement of the teeth used in the machine, lest many of the seeds,\r\nwhich are large; should be split; and as it is not easy to separate the\r\nseeds from the haulms, specially made riddles and sieves must needs be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe seed crop is usually harvested in June north of the Ohio and Potomac\r\nrivers, and southward from these in the month of May. The yield of seed\r\nruns all the way from 10 bushels per acre downwards. The average crop is\r\n4 to 5 bushels.\r\n\r\n=Renewing.=--Since crimson clover is an annual, but little can be done\r\nin the sense of renewing it on the same land without breaking the\r\nground. But in orchards, it is sometimes grown from year to year by what\r\nmay be termed a process of self-seeding. When the seed is not quite ripe\r\nin the heads, or even somewhat earlier, the orchard is plowed so as to\r\nleave some of the heads standing up along the line of the furrow. When\r\nthese have matured, the land is harrowed, which scatters the seeds in\r\nthe chaff, and from these another crop is produced. But to this plan\r\nthere is the objection that it allows the clover to draw too heavily on\r\nthe moisture in the soil before it is plowed under.\r\n\r\n=Facts Regarding Crimson Clover.=--1. When crimson clover is sown so\r\nearly in the season that it has at least three to four months in which\r\nto grow before winter sets in, the benefits to the land from sowing the\r\nseed will usually more than pay for the seed and labor, even though it\r\nshould not survive the winter.\r\n\r\n2. Prominent among the causes of failure where crimson clover does not\r\nsucceed are: (_a_) The seed fails to germinate because of the want of\r\nmoisture, or having germinated the young plants are killed by heat or\r\ndrought; (_b_) they perish in the winter from exposure to cold winds or\r\nfrosts, or by alternate freezing and thawing in the soil; or (_c_) the\r\nland is too low in fertility to produce a sufficiently vigorous growth\r\nin the plants.\r\n\r\n3. The mechanical effects upon the soil from growing crimson clover on\r\nit are very marked, especially when it inclines to stiffness, owing to\r\nthe strong development of the root growth.\r\n\r\n4. When crimson clover has been sown in the spring, a reasonably good\r\ngrowth is usually obtained before midsummer, even as far north as the\r\nCanadian boundary line, but since hot weather checks further growth and\r\nfrequently causes wilting in the plants, this variety is not equal to\r\nsome of the other varieties of clover for being sown at that season.\r\n\r\n5. In the Southern States, crimson clover has been found to render\r\nconsiderable service by aiding in preventing land from washing in the\r\nwinter season.\r\n\r\n6. When plowed under in orchards, the work should be done at an early\r\nrather than a late stage in the growth of the plants, lest it should rob\r\nthe trees of their rightful share of the moisture. Because of this, in\r\nsome instances, if not in all, the plants should be buried before the\r\nseason of full bloom and sometimes before the blooms begin to open.\r\n\r\n7. The seed is more certain to germinate while yet enclosed in the chaff\r\nscales, and because of this, where home-grown seed is used, it may be\r\nworth while to secure it in this form by flailing out the seed or\r\ntreading it out with horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWHITE CLOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite Clover (_Trifolium repens_) is also called Dutch, White Dutch,\r\nWhite Trefoil, Creeping Trifolium and Honeysuckle clover. The name Dutch\r\nclover has doubtless been applied to it because of the extent to which\r\nit is in evidence in the pastures and meadows of Holland; the name\r\nCreeping Trifolium, because of the creeping character of the stems,\r\nwhich, under favorable conditions, send roots down into the soil; and\r\nHoneysuckle clover, because of the honey supplies which it furnishes for\r\nbees. It is one of the plants known as Shamrock, the national emblem of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nWhite clover is perennial, the stems of which creep along the ground\r\nand, as above intimated, root at the joints; so that from this source\r\nplants are indefinitely multiplied. They also come from the seed. The\r\nleaves are small and very numerous, and with the exception of the flower\r\nstems and flowers, furnish all the forage obtained. The flowers are very\r\nnumerous, especially when showery weather precedes and accompanies the\r\nflowering season. They are large for the size of the plant, are\r\nsupported by a leafless stem of considerable length, and are white or\r\ntinted with a delicate rose color. The roots are numerous and fibrous.\r\nThey cannot go down into the soil so deeply as the larger clovers;\r\nhence, the dwarfing effect of dry seasons upon the growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. White Clover (_Trifolium repens_)\r\n  Oregon Experiment Station]\r\n\r\nThis plant is exceedingly hardy. It comes out from under the snow with a\r\ngreen tint, and the leaves are not easily injured by the frosts of\r\nautumn. The growth is not rapid until the general late rains of spring\r\nfall freely. It then pushes on rapidly, and, sending up innumerable\r\nflower stems, turns the pastures in which it abounds into immense flower\r\ngardens in the months of May and June, according to the latitude of the\r\nlocality. The bloom remains out for a considerable time, and free\r\ngrazing has the effect of prolonging the period of bloom. Under such\r\nconditions, blossoms continue to form and mature seeds during much of\r\nthe summer. When these escape being grazed, they fall down upon the land\r\nand aid in forming additional plants. Hence it is that when white clover\r\nhas once possessed a soil, it so stores the land with seed possessed of\r\nso much vitality that subsequently white clover plants grow, as it were,\r\nspontaneously on these lands when they have been thus grazed even for a\r\nlimited term of years.\r\n\r\nThe power of this useful plant to travel and possess the land is only\r\nequalled by that of blue grass. When timber lands are cleared, white\r\nclover plants soon appear, and in a few years will spread over the whole\r\nsurface of the land. But the amount of grazing furnished by it varies\r\ngreatly with the character of the season. Some seasons its bloom is\r\nscarcely in evidence; other seasons it overspreads the pastures.\r\n\r\nWhile it is an excellent pasture plant for stock, they do not relish it\r\nso highly as some other pasture plants; when forming seed, it is least\r\nvaluable for horses, owing to the extent to which it salivates them. Its\r\ndiminutive habit of growth unfits it for making meadows, unless in\r\nconjunction with other hay plants. In nutritive properties, it is placed\r\nahead of medium red clover. Some growers have spoken highly of it as a\r\npasture plant for swine.\r\n\r\nBeing a legume, it has the power of enriching soils with nitrogen, but\r\nprobably not to so great an extent as the larger varieties of clover.\r\nIts rootlets, however, have a beneficent influence on the texture of\r\nsoils, because of their number, and because of the power of the stems to\r\nproduce fresh plants, which occupy the soil when other plants die. The\r\nlatter furnish a continued source of food to other grasses, which grow\r\nalong with white clover in permanent pastures.\r\n\r\nAlong with blue grass, white clover plants aid in choking out weeds.\r\nThis result follows largely as the outcome of the close sod formed by\r\nthe two. But in some soils, plants of large growth and bushes and young\r\ntrees will not thus be crowded out.\r\n\r\n=Distribution.=--White clover is certainly indigenous to Europe and to\r\nthe Northern States, and probably Western Asia. It grows in every\r\ncountry in Europe, but with greatest luxuriance in those countries which\r\nborder on the North Sea, the climates of which are very humid, and more\r\nespecially in the Netherlands and Great Britain. It stands in high\r\nfavor in Holland, but is not regarded so highly in England, owing,\r\nprobably, to the great variety of grasses grown there in permanent\r\npastures. It is generally thought that it was not indigenous to the\r\nSouthern States, but has reached these from those farther north. It\r\nwould seem to be capable of growing in all countries well adapted to the\r\nkeeping of cattle; hence, it follows in the wake of successful\r\nlive-stock husbandry.\r\n\r\nWhite clover seems able to adapt itself to a great variety of climatic\r\nconditions. Nevertheless, it is certainly better adapted to a moderately\r\ncool climate than to one that is hot, and to a moist, humid climate than\r\nto one that is dry. It has much power to live through dry seasons, but\r\nit will not thrive in a climate in which the rainfall is too little for\r\nthe successful growth of small cereal grains. Where snow covers it in\r\nwinter, this clover will grow on timber soils as far north as any kind\r\nof cereal can be made to mature; and it will also grow as far south as\r\nthe Mexican boundary on the higher grounds, when there is enough\r\nmoisture present to sustain it.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be correct to say that this plant is found in every\r\nState in the Union, and that it succeeds well in nearly all the Northern\r\nStates, from sea to sea. Although it grows well in certain parts of the\r\nSouthern States, especially in those that lie northward, the general\r\nadaptation in these is not so high as in those further north. The\r\nhighest adaptation in the United States is probably found in the Puget\r\nSound region and in the hardwood timber producing areas of the States\r\nwhich lie south from the Great Lakes and in proximity to them, as\r\nNortheastern Minnesota, Northern Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and New York.\r\nBut the adaptation is also high in the more elevated of the mountain\r\nvalleys of the Northwestern States when irrigated waters may be led on\r\nto these lands. The areas lowest in adaptation are those that lie within\r\nthe semi-arid belt. The low-lying lands of the South, where hot weather\r\nis prolonged in summer, are likewise low in their adaptation, but not so\r\nlow as the former. The prairie areas of the Northern Mississippi basin\r\nhave an adaptation for growing white clover that may be termed\r\nintermediate, but where hardwood forests grow naturally on these the\r\nadaptation is high. In New England the climatic conditions are very\r\nfavorable, much more so than the soil conditions.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, conditions are found highly favorable to the growth of this\r\nplant in the country lying eastward from Lake Huron, north of Lakes Erie\r\nand Ontario and also on both sides of the St. Lawrence River. Adaptation\r\nis also high along the Pacific and in the mountain valleys not distant\r\nfrom the Pacific. In all the areas of Canada, which once produced\r\nforests, this plant will grow well. But north from Lakes Huron and\r\nSuperior, the soil conditions are against it, because of their rocky\r\ncharacter. Certain forest areas west from Lake Superior, and also in\r\nother parts, the sandy soils of which sustain a growth of Jack Pine\r\n(_Pinus murrayana_) trees, do not grow white clover with much vigor.\r\nThe prairie areas of Canada, westward from Lake Superior to the\r\nmountains, do not grow white clover with much success, and the\r\nadaptation for its growth would seem to lessen gradually until the Rocky\r\nMountains are approached.\r\n\r\n=Soils.=--Small white clover will grow on almost any kind of soil, but\r\nby no means equally well. Highest, probably, in adaptation, especially\r\nwhen climatic conditions are considered along with those of soil, are\r\nthe clay loams west of the Cascade Mountains and northward from\r\nCalifornia to Alaska. During the moist months of early summer, this\r\nplant turns the pastures in these areas into a flower garden. Almost\r\nequally high in adaptation are the volcanic ash soils of the Rocky\r\nMountain valleys. When amply supplied with water, the finest crops of\r\nwhite clover can be grown even superior to those grown on the lands\r\ndescribed above. Almost the same may be said of what are termed the\r\nhardwood timber soils, which are usually made up of clay loam lying upon\r\nclay. Such areas abound in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ontario and\r\nsome States further south. In these soils it grows with much luxuriance,\r\nmore especially when lime and potash are abundant. Similar luxuriance\r\nmay be looked for in the deposit soils of river basins in which the clay\r\nelement predominates, but not in those that are largely made up of sand.\r\nIt will also grow well on the stiffest clays, whether white or red, when\r\nmoisture is present. On prairie soils, the success attending it is\r\ndependent largely on their texture, composition and the moisture which\r\nthey contain under normal conditions. The more firm these soils are,\r\nthe better will the clover grow in them, and _vice versa_. This is\r\nequivalent to saying that the more clay they contain, the better will\r\nthe white clover grow in them.\r\n\r\nWhere the humus soils of the prairies are deep and are underlaid with\r\nclay, white clover will grow much better in the subsoil, if laid bare,\r\nthan in the surface soil. Prairie soils which lift with the wind are ill\r\nadapted to the growth of this plant, whatsoever may be their\r\ncomposition. Much of the soil in the semi-arid belt would grow this\r\nplant in fine form, but want of moisture, where irrigation is absent\r\nmakes its growth prohibitory in a large portion of this area. On\r\nordinary slough soils, this clover finds a congenial home, but it will\r\nnot grow quite so well, relatively, in these as alsike clover. On sandy\r\nsoils, such as those on which Jack pine and Norway pine (_Pinus\r\nresinosa_) grow, this plant will maintain itself, and in wet seasons\r\nwill make considerable showing on these; but in very dry seasons the\r\nplants will die, the growth the following season coming from seeds\r\nalready in the soil. In the soils of the extreme South, the inability of\r\nwhite clover to make a good showing is probably more the result of\r\nsummer heat than of want of power in the plants to gather food. In those\r\nof the Southwest, want of moisture and excessive heat render its growth,\r\nin a sense, prohibitory.\r\n\r\n=Place in the Rotation.=--Since white clover is usually not sown for\r\nmeadow, but is rather sown for pasture, it can scarcely be called a\r\nrotation plant in the strict sense of the term; and yet, because of the\r\nextent to which it grows when it has once obtained a footing in soils,\r\nit is more or less frequent in all rotations in which grass or clover is\r\none of the factors. As it usually comes into the grass pastures, when\r\nthese have become established, it will occupy about the same place as\r\nblue grass in rotations; that is to say, whatever would be proper to sow\r\nafter the blue grass would be proper to sow after this plant; since the\r\ntwo usually unite in making the same sod. It will, therefore, be in\r\norder to follow this plant with corn to feed upon the nitrogen furnished\r\nby the clover. The same will be true of any small cereal that has\r\nspecial adaptation for being grown on overturned sod, as for instance,\r\nflax or oats, or of any crop that revels in the decay of vegetable\r\nmatter, more especially in the early stages of such decay, as, for\r\ninstance, potatoes and rape. When white clover is sown on land that is\r\ncultivated, though only sown as a factor in a pasture crop, as with all\r\nother clovers it may best be sown on land that is clean; that is, on\r\nland on which the preceding crop has been cultivated to the extent of\r\nsecuring a clean surface on the same. If, however, this crop must needs\r\nbe sown on land that has not been thus cleaned, its great inherent\r\nhardihood will enable it to establish itself where some clovers and\r\ngrasses would fail.\r\n\r\nIt is common to sow white clover on land from which the forest has\r\nrecently been removed, also on natural prairie, where it has not\r\npreviously grown. In these instances it simply follows the crop of\r\nforest in the one case and of native prairie in the other. But it will\r\nnot take possession of the land in either case to the exclusion of other\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\n=Preparing the Soil.=--The preparation of the soil for growing this\r\nplant is much the same as for growing other plants of the clover or\r\ngrass family. Fineness, firmness, cleanness and moistness are the chief\r\nessentials to be looked for in making the seed-bed. For the same reason\r\nthat it has much power to grow among weeds for so small a plant, it has\r\nalso much power to grow on surfaces not in the best condition of\r\npreparation for receiving so small a seed. But when sown to provide a\r\nseed crop, it is specially necessary to make the land thoroughly clean\r\nbefore sowing the seed. This is necessary for the reason, first, that\r\nsmall white clover, because of its tardiness in growing in the spring,\r\nand because of its comparatively small growth has not much power to\r\ncrowd weeds; and second, because of the labor involved in preventing\r\nweed seeds from maturing in a crop that ripens its seeds somewhat late\r\nin the season. While it is advantageous to burn off the grass from a\r\nnatural meadow where white clover, is to be sown, it is not so\r\nessential, nevertheless, as when preparing such land for being sown with\r\nsome other varieties of grass or clover. The young plants will endure\r\nunder conditions which would cause those of many other varieties to\r\nfail.\r\n\r\n=Sowing.=--White clover is sown by much the same methods as the medium\r\nred variety. (See page 75.) But it will stand more hardship than the\r\nother variety; hence, it may be sown earlier. This means that it may be\r\nsown in northerly latitudes any time, from the melting of the winter\r\nsnows until early summer, and in southern latitudes almost any season,\r\nexcept during the hot summer months. In either latitude, however, the\r\nearly spring is usually the most suitable season for sowing.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be sown by hand, by hand machines, or by the seeder\r\nattachment of grain drills. It is more commonly sown along with other\r\nclovers and grasses, and the methods of sowing these will also be\r\nsuitable for the sowing of white clover. (See page 18.) But when the\r\nseed is sown alone, as for producing seed crops, the nurse crop need not\r\nof necessity be sown thinly, from the fear that the young plants should\r\nbe smothered by an undue density of shade.\r\n\r\nThere is no mixture of clovers and grasses grown for pasture to which\r\nthis plant may not be added with profit, providing the seed is not\r\nalready in the land in sufficient supply. But it is seldom sown with\r\neither clovers or grasses, or with these combined, for the production of\r\nhay. It is the judgment of the author, however, that in localities which\r\nhave special adaptation for the growth of this plant, it should render\r\nexcellent service in providing hay for sheep, if sown along with alsike\r\nclover, and a little timothy; the latter being sown mainly to support\r\nthe clovers so that they will not lodge. The white clover would furnish\r\nhay considerably finer even than the alsike; hence, such hay should be\r\npeculiarly adapted to the needs of sheep. Some authorities object to the\r\npresence of white clover in hay intended for horses or cattle, lest it\r\nshould induce in them more or less salivation. The author leans to the\r\nopinion that in cured hay injury from the source named will in no\r\ninstance prove serious, owing to the small amount, relatively, of white\r\nclover in average hay crops.\r\n\r\nThe amount of seed to sow will vary with such conditions as soil,\r\nclimate and the nature of the pasture, but in any event it need not be\r\nlarge. The seeds of white clover are small, considerably smaller than\r\nthose of alsike. For ordinary grazing along with other grasses, or\r\ngrasses and clovers, it will seldom be necessary to sow more than 1\r\npound of seed per acre. Sometimes a less quantity will suffice, as when\r\nthere is more or less of seed in the land, and, as already intimated,\r\nbecause of the store of seed in the land in many instances, it is not\r\nnecessary to sow it at all. Especially is this true of sections which\r\nhave been tilled for some time. When sown with alsike clover to provide\r\nhay, 2 pounds of seed per acre would be a maximum amount, and 4 pounds\r\nwhen sown alone to provide seed.\r\n\r\nWhen sown in newly cleared forest lands or on prairie sod, the methods\r\nto be followed will depend upon circumstances. More commonly when thus\r\nsown the seed is not covered artificially; consequently, much of it in\r\ndry seasons may not grow. The plan, therefore, of sowing small amounts\r\nof the seed on such lands two years in succession would be safer than to\r\nsow twice the amount of the same in one year. In time this clover would\r\nfind its way into such areas. It comes through such agencies as birds,\r\nhay fed to teams engaged in lumbering, and the overflow of streams; and\r\nas soon as it gets a foothold its distribution is further accelerated by\r\nthe droppings of cattle which contain the seeds, and by the winds.\r\n\r\nThe power of this plant to increase is simply wonderful. This is owing\r\nto: 1. The relatively large number of seedheads produced from the\r\nplants. 2. The power which these have to multiply by means of rootlets\r\nfrom the incumbent stems, which fasten into the soil. 3. The prolonged\r\nseason during which the heads form. 4. The habit of growth in many of\r\nthe heads, because of which they are not grazed off. 5. The strong\r\nvitality of the seed. And 6. The great hardihood of the plants.\r\n\r\n=Pasturing.=--White clover ranks next to blue grass as a pasture plant\r\nwithin the area of its adaptation (see page 261), when its\r\nproductiveness, continuity in growth, ability to remain in the land,\r\npalatability and nutritive properties are considered together. In\r\npalatability it ranks as medium only. In the early part of the season\r\nwhile it is still tender and juicy, it will be eaten by stock with\r\navidity, but as the seed-maturing season is approached, it is not so\r\nhighly relished. In nutrition it ranks higher than medium red clover. It\r\ndoes not make much of a showing in the early part of the season, but in\r\nfavorable seasons, about the time that blue grass begins to fail, it\r\ngrows rapidly and furnishes much pasture.\r\n\r\nIt is pre-eminently the complement of a blue-grass pasture. When these\r\ngrow together, the two will furnish grazing in a moist year through all\r\nthe season of grazing. Both have the property of retaining their hold\r\nindefinitely in many soils and of soon making a sward on the same\r\nwithout being re-sown, when the cultivation of the ground ceases. The\r\nblue grass grows quickly quite early and late in the season, and the\r\nclover grows likewise during much of the summer. As the older plants of\r\nthe clover fail, fresh ones appear, and the blue grass feeds on the\r\nformer in their decay. They thus furnish humus and nitrogen for the\r\nsustenance of the blue grass.\r\n\r\nBut much moisture is necessary in order to insure good blue grass\r\npastures, and they are more luxuriant when the moisture comes early in\r\nthe season, rather than when the plants are nearing the season of bloom.\r\nTo such an extent is white clover influenced in growth by such weather,\r\nthat in some seasons it will abound in certain pastures, while in others\r\nit will scarcely appear in the same. Those favorable seasons are\r\nfrequently spoken of as being \"white-clover years.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this plant furnishes good grazing for all kinds of domestic\r\nanimals kept upon the farm, as a pasture for horses and mules, there is\r\nthe objection to it that it will in a considerable degree so salivate\r\nthem that much \"slobbering\" follows. This is sometimes produced to such\r\nan extent as to be seriously harmful. The trouble from this cause\r\nincreases as the seed-forming season is approached. It has been known\r\nthus to salivate cattle, but the danger of injury to them from this\r\nsource is slight. These injurious results to horses will be obviated in\r\nproportion as the other grasses are allowed to grow up amid the clover;\r\nin other words, in proportion as the pasture is not grazed closely early\r\nin the season. The animals which then graze on these pastures must take\r\nother food with the clover.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting for Hay.=--Since white clover is seldom grown alone for hay,\r\nand since it seldom forms the most bulky factor in a hay crop, the\r\nmethods of harvesting will be similar to those practiced in harvesting\r\nthe more bulky factor or factors of the crop. The want of bulk in this\r\nclover is against it as a hay crop, owing to the smallness of the\r\nyields, compared with the other hay crops that may be usually grown on\r\nthe same land. As a factor of a hay crop, however, this little plant\r\nwill add much to its weight and also to its palatability, especially for\r\nsheep and dairy cows.\r\n\r\nWhen it is grown for hay in mixtures in which the large clovers or\r\ntimothy predominates, the white clover should, of course, be cut at the\r\nmost suitable season for cutting these clovers or the timothy, as one is\r\npresent in excess. When the larger clovers predominate, the method of\r\ncuring will be the same as for curing these (see page 234), that is to\r\nsay, it can best be cured in cocks. When timothy predominates, the\r\nmethod of curing will be the same as for timothy; that is to say, it may\r\nbe cured in the cock or in the winrow, according to circumstances. Owing\r\nto the fineness of the stems, it may be cured more quickly than red\r\nclover; hence, its presence in a crop of timothy will not delay much the\r\ncuring of the latter unless when present in great abundance.\r\n\r\nUnder some conditions it would be easily possible to grow white clover\r\nfor hay alone, and in some instances with profit, more especially in\r\nproviding what would be a matchless fodder for young lambs and young\r\ncalves. It might be so grown in the clover lands that lie immediately\r\nsouthward from Lakes Superior and Huron, in the northern Rocky Mountain\r\nvalleys and on the valley lands around Puget Sound. On these lands in a\r\nfavorable season, it would be quite possible to cut not less than 2 tons\r\nper acre, while on average land white clover alone would not yield more,\r\nprobably, than 1/2 ton per acre. But even when grown for the purpose\r\nnamed, some alsike clover sown along with the white clover would add to\r\nthe yield of hay, and without in any considerable degree lessening its\r\nvalue for the use named.\r\n\r\n=Securing Seed.=--White clover is a great seed-producing plant. The\r\nseason for bloom covers a period relatively long, and the number of\r\nblossoms produced under favorable conditions on a given area is very\r\nlarge. But when seed crops are to be produced with regularity, it is\r\nnecessary that moisture can be depended upon in sufficient supply in the\r\nspring months to produce a vigorous growth in the plants. Such a climate\r\nis found in the Puget Sound country and in a less degree for some\r\ndistance south from Lakes Huron and Superior. In areas which can be\r\nirrigated, it is not imperative that the climate shall be thus moist.\r\nSuch areas, therefore, may be looked upon as possessed of superior\r\nadaptation for the growth of seed crops of white clover.\r\n\r\nThe areas are limited, however, in which seed crops are grown in the\r\nUnited States; so limited are they that it has been found very difficult\r\nto locate them. Wood County in Central Wisconsin grows a considerable\r\nquantity, and some counties northward in the same State, and probably\r\nalso some parts of Northern Michigan, will grow seed equally well.\r\n\r\nWhere a seed crop is grown every care should be exercised to have it\r\nfree from foul weeds. The aim should be to grow it on clean land.\r\nSometimes, however, the seed is self-sown; that is, it comes into the\r\nland without being sown, but even in such areas it is safer to sow 3\r\npounds of seed per acre in the early spring along with a nurse crop. The\r\nbest seed crops in Wisconsin and Michigan are grown on a reasonably\r\nstiff clay soil. To get a full crop of seed, it should be pastured for a\r\ntime in the spring, or the crop should be run over with the mower about\r\nJune 1st, setting the mower bar so as to cut 3 or 4 inches high. No harm\r\nwill follow if some of the tops of the clover should be cut off. The\r\ngrass and weeds thus cut are usually left on the ground, but sometimes\r\nit may be necessary to remove them. In a short time the field should be\r\none mass of bloom.\r\n\r\nThe crop is ready for being harvested when the bulk of the heads have\r\nturned a dark brown and when the bulk of them have assumed a reddish\r\nbrown tint, notwithstanding that some of the later heads may still be\r\nin full flower. Vigorous crops may be cut with the self-rake reaper set\r\nto cut low, otherwise many of the heads will not be gathered. To\r\nfacilitate this process, the ground should be made quite smooth even\r\nbefore sowing the seed. But the seed crop is more commonly cut with the\r\nfield mower, to the cutter bar of which a galvanized platform is bolted,\r\nthe sides of which are about 6 inches high. From this the clover is\r\nraked off into bunches with a rake. These bunches should not be large,\r\nand since nearly all the heads in them will point upward, they should\r\nnot be turned over if rained on, but simply lifted up with a suitable\r\nfork and moved on to other ground.\r\n\r\nThe seed crop cures quickly. It may be drawn and threshed at once, or it\r\nmay be stacked and threshed when convenient. If stacked, a goodly supply\r\nof old hay or straw should be put next the ground, and much care should\r\nbe taken to protect the clover by finishing off the stack carefully with\r\nsome kind of grass or hay that will shed the rain easily. Since the\r\nheads are very small and numerous, and since, as with all clovers, they\r\nbreak off easily when ripe, much promptness and care should be exercised\r\nin harvesting the seed crop. The best machine for threshing a seed so\r\nsmall is the clover huller.\r\n\r\nThe yields of seed will run all the way from less than 3 bushels per\r\nacre to 5 bushels, and some crops have been harvested in Wisconsin which\r\ngave 7 bushels per acre. Four bushels would probably be about an average\r\nyield. As the price is usually relatively high compared with other\r\nclovers, the seed from white clover would be quite remunerative were it\r\nnot that in a dry season the yield is disappointing. In some instances\r\ntwo crops are grown in succession; in others, one crop is reaped. The\r\nland is then sown to barley the next year, and the following year clover\r\nseed may be reaped again without sowing a second time. Usually, after\r\ntwo successive crops of seed have been cut, blue grass crowds the\r\nclover.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to grow prodigious crops of white clover in\r\ncertain of the northern Rocky Mountain valleys, as, for instance, in\r\nMontana and Washington, where the conditions for the application of\r\nwater to grow the plants and of withholding the same when ripening the\r\nseed are completely under the control of the husbandman. The soils in\r\nthese valleys, as previously intimated, have high adaptation for growing\r\nwhite clover.\r\n\r\n=Renewing.=--White clover is probably more easily renewed than any plant\r\nof the clover family. In fact, it seldom requires renewal in a pasture\r\nin which it has obtained a footing as long as it remains a pasture. This\r\narises from the abundance of the seed production and from the power of\r\nthe same to retain germinating properties for a long period.\r\nNevertheless, there may be instances when it may be wise to scatter more\r\nseed in the early spring in a pasture in which white clover may not be\r\nsufficiently abundant. It is also renewed, in a sense, when suitable\r\nfertilizer is applied on the pastures. A dressing of potash will greatly\r\nstimulate the growth of any kind of clover on nearly all soils; hence,\r\nthe marked increase in the growth of the clover that usually follows the\r\napplication of a dressing of wood ashes, especially in the unleached\r\nform. Top-dressings of farmyard manure are also quite helpful to such\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion must not be reached that because white clover is not much\r\nin evidence in a permanent pasture for one or two, or even three dry\r\nseasons, if these should follow each other, that it will not come again\r\nand with great vigor and in much abundance when a wet season arrives\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n=For Lawns.=--No other plant of the clover family is so frequently sown\r\nwhen making lawns. For such a use it is not sown alone, but is always\r\nthe complement of Kentucky blue grass or of a mixture of grasses. No two\r\nplants can be singled out that are more suitable for lawn making than\r\nwhite clover and Kentucky blue grass. Both are fine in their habit of\r\ngrowth. The two in conjunction usually make a more dense sward than\r\neither alone, and the clover will grow and produce many flowers, if not\r\nkept clipped too closely when the blue grass is resting in midsummer.\r\n\r\nAs lawns are usually small, and a dense sward is desired as quickly as\r\nit can be obtained; the seed should be sown thickly on lawns, at the\r\nrate of not less than 5 pounds of seed to the acre. The early spring is\r\nthe best time for sowing the seed, but in mild climates it may be sown\r\nat almost any season that may be convenient, providing the ground is\r\nmoist enough to germinate the seed. In cold climates, the seed should\r\nbe sown not later than August, unless when sown too late for autumn\r\ngermination. This in some instances may not only be proper, but\r\ncommendable.\r\n\r\n=As a Honey Plant.=--White clover is proverbial for its ability to\r\nfurnish honey. There is probably no single plant which furnishes more or\r\nbetter honey. But its value for such a use varies greatly in different\r\nyears. In seasons that are quite dry in the spring, it makes but little\r\ngrowth and produces but few blossoms; hence, in such seasons bees can\r\nobtain but little honey, relatively, from such a source. It would\r\ndoubtless be good policy, therefore, for the growers to encourage the\r\nsowing of alsike clover where bees are much kept, since the growth of\r\nthis clover is less hindered by dry weather at the season named. Less\r\nclose pasturing than is commonly practiced would favorably influence the\r\nproduction of honey from white clover, and would also result in\r\nconsiderably greater yields of pasture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nJAPAN CLOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nJapan Clover (_Lespedeza striata_) was introduced from China or Japan,\r\nor from both countries, into South Carolina in 1849, under the name\r\nJapan clover. It is thought the seed came in connection with the tea\r\ntrade with these countries. According to Phares, the generic term\r\n_Lespedeza_, borne by the one-seeded pods of the plants of this family,\r\nwas assigned to them in honor of Lespedez, a governor of Florida under\r\nSpanish rule. It is sometimes called Bush clover, from the bush-shaped\r\nhabit of growth in the plants when grown on good soils, but is to be\r\ncarefully distinguished from the Bush clovers proper, which are of\r\nlittle value as food plants.\r\n\r\nJapan clover is an annual, but owing to its remarkable power to retain\r\nits hold upon the soil, through the shedding of the seed and the growing\r\nof the same, it has equal ability with many perennials to retain its\r\nhold upon the soil. It does not start until late in the spring, nor can\r\nit endure much frost; but its ability to grow in and retain its hold\r\nupon poor soils is remarkable, while its powers of self-propagation in\r\nthe South would seem to be nearly equal to those of small white clover\r\n(_Trifolum repens_) in the North. It is, therefore, one of the hardiest\r\nplants of the clover family. Where it has once obtained a foothold, in\r\nsome soils, at least, it has been known to crowd out Bermuda grass and\r\neven broom sage.\r\n\r\nThe form of the plants is much affected by the character of the soil in\r\nwhich they grow. On poor soils, the habit of growth is low and\r\nspreading; on good soils, it is more upright. But it is always more or\r\nless branched, and the stems are relatively stiffer than those of other\r\nclovers. They rise but a few inches above the ground in poor soils, not\r\nmore than 2 to 4; but in good rich soils it will attain to the height of\r\n2 feet. About 1 foot may be named as the average height. The leaves are\r\ntrifoliate. The flower produced in the axils of the leaves are numerous,\r\nbut quite small. They appear from July onward, according to locality,\r\nbut are probably more numerous in September, and vary from a pink to a\r\nrose-colored or purplish tint. The seed pods are small, flattish oval in\r\nshape and contain but one seed. The tap roots are strong in proportion\r\nto the size of the plant and are relatively deep feeding; hence, the\r\nability of the plant to survive severe drought. The roots have much\r\npower to penetrate stiff subsoils.\r\n\r\nJapan clover is not usually relished by stock at first, but they soon\r\ncome to like it, and are then fond of it. Close grazing does not readily\r\ninjure it; it also furnishes a good quality of hay, but except on\r\nreasonably good soils, the yields of the hay are not very large. The\r\nchemical analysis compares well with that of red clover.\r\n\r\nJapan clover is also an excellent soil renovator. In the Southern\r\nStates, it is credited with the renovation of soils so poor that the\r\nreturn was not worth the labor of tillage. Throughout much of the South,\r\nit has rendered much service in thus improving soils. It also grows so\r\nthickly on many soils as to lessen and, in many instances, entirely\r\nprevent washing, that great bane of Southern soils. It will even grow\r\nand produce some pasture under the shade of grass or Southern pines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Japan Clover (_Lespedeza striata_)\r\n  Tennessee Experiment Station]\r\n\r\n=Distribution.=--Japan clover is said to be native to China and other\r\ncountries in Eastern Asia. When introduced into Japan, the soil and\r\nclimatic conditions proved so favorable that before long it spread out\r\nover the whole island. Since its introduction into the United States it\r\nhas spread very rapidly.\r\n\r\nSince it does not grow early in the season, it needs a warm climate. It\r\ngrows much better in moist weather than in a time of drought, but it\r\nwill also continue to grow in the absence of rain until the drought\r\nbecomes excessive. It will then wilt down on poor soils, but grows again\r\nas soon as rain falls.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of Japan clover into the United States in 1849,\r\nor, as some think, somewhat earlier, it has spread over the entire\r\nSouth, from the Ohio River to the Gulf, from the Atlantic to the\r\nMississippi, and also to the States of Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas\r\nbeyond the Mississippi. It was early introduced into Georgia, and came\r\ninto much favor there. It reached Tennessee in 1870, and soon spread\r\nover many counties. It came later into Louisiana, but soon became very\r\npopular there, largely through the efforts of Colonel J. Burgess McGhee\r\nof West Feliciana, who gave much attention to cultivating it and placing\r\nit before the public. While it will grow readily in any part of the\r\nSouth, it renders better service in the Gulf States than in those\r\nfarther north, owing to the longer season for growth. North of the Ohio\r\nRiver it is not likely to be cultivated, since in the Northern States it\r\nis not needed, because of the abundance of the red clovers and also the\r\nsmall white. It is a less abundant producer than the red clovers, and is\r\nalso less palatable. Moreover, the season for growing it is much shorter\r\nin these States than in those south; a fact which greatly lessens its\r\nadaptation to northern conditions.\r\n\r\nJapan clover has no mission for any of the provinces of Canada, and for\r\nthe reason that it has no mission for the Northern States.\r\n\r\n=Soils.=--Japan clover is adapted to a wide range of soils. There would\r\nseem to be a concensus of opinion in the Southern States that it will\r\ngrow on almost any kind of soil. It has grown well on hard, stiff clays,\r\nboth white and red; on sandy levels; on gravelly undulations and slopes;\r\non the banks and in the bottom of gullies; on soils too poor to produce\r\nother crops, as on denuded hills and also in groves. But it will grow\r\nmuch better, of course, on good, rich land, as on moist loams and rich\r\nalluvial soils. While it prefers moist situations, it is not well\r\nadapted to saturated lands. There is no useful pasture plant in the\r\nSouth that would seem so well able to fight its own battle unaided on\r\npoor soils as Japan clover, nor is there any which has brought so much\r\nof renovation to these for the labor involved.\r\n\r\n=Place in the Rotation.=--Japan clover can scarcely be classed as a\r\nrotation plant in the strict sense of the term, since it more frequently\r\ncomes into the fields, as it were, spontaneously, and owing to the\r\nuncommon degree to which it has the power of re-seeding itself, it is\r\nfrequently grown and grazed for successive years on the land upon which\r\nit has been allowed thus to grow. Nevertheless, since it is a nitrogen\r\ngatherer, when it has fertilized the land sufficiently by bringing to it\r\na supply of nitrogen and by putting humus into it, crops should follow\r\nsuch as require much of growth to grow them in best form. Such are\r\ncotton, corn and the small cereal grains. Owing to its power to grow on\r\nworn and even on abandoned soils, and to crowd weeds that grow on them,\r\non such soils it comes in between the cessation of cultivation and the\r\nresumption of the same. It frequently grows as a volunteer crop along\r\nwith Johnson grass, and where it comes, it tends to crowd grasses of but\r\nlittle value, as brown sage.\r\n\r\nWhere pasture is desired winter and summer, it should be quite possible\r\nin some localities to obtain it by sowing such crops annually, as winter\r\noats and sand vetches (_Vicia villosa_) every autumn, and the seed of\r\nJapan clover on the same. The crops first named would provide winter and\r\nspring grazing, and the clover, summer and autumn grazing. The clovers\r\nand the vetches would both aid in fertilizing the land.\r\n\r\n=Preparing the Soil.=--While careful preparation of the land will result\r\nin more certain and uniform germination in the seed, and more rapid\r\ngrowth in the plants, careful preparation of the seed is not so\r\nnecessary with Japan clover as with many other pasture and hay plants.\r\nThe seeds are strong in germinating power and the plants are much able\r\nto grow, even under adverse conditions, when they do germinate. Usually,\r\nthe preparation which is suited to nurse crops, amid which this clover\r\nis sown, will be suited also to the clover when it is sown thus.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, however, it is allowed to re-seed itself where it has\r\nbeen once sown, or even where it may have come into the soil without\r\nsowing. In this way successive pasture crops have been obtained. But\r\nusually where hay crops are wanted, it will prove more satisfactory, all\r\nthings considered, to sow the seed.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, simply scarifying the ground has been found a\r\nsufficient preparation for the seed. Any implement that will pulverize\r\nthe surface for a few inches downward will answer for such work. In very\r\nmany instances, seed, of course, self-sown has become rooted and grown\r\nvigorously on unplowed land.\r\n\r\n=Sowing.=--Japan clover is more commonly sown in the spring, but it is\r\nsometimes sown in the autumn. There is more or less of hazard in sowing\r\nit in the autumn north of the Gulf States, since when the plants are\r\nyoung they will not stand much frost. For the same reason, there is the\r\nelement of hazard in sowing it too early in the spring. Spring sowing\r\nstands highest in favor, taking the whole area into account, in which\r\nthe clover is grown. While it is possible to sow the seed too early in\r\nthe spring, it will be readily apparent that the earlier it may be sown\r\nwithout hazard to the young plants, the better will be the returns,\r\nbecause of the growth secured before the advent of dry weather.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be sown by any of the methods adopted when sowing medium\r\nred clover. (See page 78.) The method which is most labor-saving,\r\nhowever, when sown with a nurse crop, is that which sows it with an\r\nattachment to the grain drill used in sowing the nurse crop. If allowed\r\nto fall in front of the drill tubes, it will not usually need any other\r\ncovering than that furnished by the drill tubes followed by the roller.\r\n\r\nIt may be sown with any of the small cereals, whether these are grown\r\nfor pasture, for hay, or for grain. When these are fall sown and the\r\nclover seed is not sown until the spring, it will be well worth while,\r\nwhen the weather and soil will admit of it, to cover the seed with the\r\nharrow. It may also be advisable to sow the seed in pastures, as, for\r\ninstance, along with orchard grass, or with tall oat grass, as it would\r\ntend to fill the vacancies in the land.\r\n\r\nWhen sown alone, 10 pounds of seed per acre will usually suffice. But\r\nwhere there is much seed in the land that has been self-sown, a less\r\nquantity will suffice. Where hay crops are wanted from year to year on\r\nthe same land, it may be obtained by simply disking the land and\r\nre-sowing. If the hay is allowed to approach maturity before being cut,\r\nsufficient seed will fall to re-sow the land for the next year's crop,\r\nbut the quality of hay so ripe is not so good as if cut earlier. In\r\npastures, the grazing must not be too close when self-seeding is wanted.\r\n\r\n=Pasturing.=--Japan clover is much used in providing grazing in the\r\nSouth. Some writers have spoken of it as being the most valuable grazing\r\nplant that grows in the South. Viewed from the standpoint of\r\nproductiveness, this would be assigning it too high a place, since\r\nBermuda grass produces more grazing, but taking productiveness and the\r\nprobable influence exerted on soil fertility together, the estimate may\r\nbe correct. The ease with which Japan clover may be propagated is also a\r\nstrong point in its favor.\r\n\r\nSince it starts late in the spring, it only provides grazing during the\r\nsummer and autumn months, from May, June or July onward, according to\r\nthe locality, and it fails with the appearance of the first heavy\r\nfrosts. In moist situations, it will furnish grazing during all the\r\nsummer and autumn, if not allowed to seed, but in time of drought, it\r\nmay wither on dry, thin soils and come on again when the rains of autumn\r\nbegin to fall. In order to keep the grazing tender and palatable, it\r\nshould be reasonably close. If allowed to mature much seed before\r\ngrazing begins, the plants will then die, to the great injury of the\r\ngrazing.\r\n\r\nThat stock do not take kindly to it at first, as they do to alfalfa and\r\nsome other plants, cannot be doubted. But they can soon learn to relish\r\nit. It has been praised both for milk and meat production; hence, the\r\naim should be to have it in all permanent pastures. In some of these it\r\nmay be necessary to sow a few pounds of seed per acre at the first. If\r\nthe grazing is not too close, the plants thereafter will sufficiently\r\nre-seed the land. It has been found quite possible in short rotations to\r\nsecure pasture from Japan clover without sowing it on land on which it\r\nhas once grown. But to accomplish this effectively, the grazing must not\r\nbe so close as to preclude a self-seeding. By growing such plants for\r\nwinter and spring grazing, as turf oats and sand vetches, and then\r\ngrazing the Japan clover, which will grow later on lands thus managed,\r\ngrazing may be furnished indefinitely from year to year.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting for Hay.=--Japan clover is a good hay plant when grown on\r\nstrong soils. The quality is good also when grown under adverse\r\nconditions, but the quantity is deficient. On good soils, the yield is\r\nfrom 1 to 2 tons per acre, the average being about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 tons.\r\nThe hay is also quite merchantable in Southern markets. It is considered\r\nsuperior to baled timothy--timothy brought in from the North--especially\r\nwhen fed to cows producing milk. Japan clover is best cut when the\r\nplants are in full bloom. But harvesting is frequently deferred to a\r\nperiod somewhat later where self-seeding of the land is desirable. Late\r\ncutting, however, lowers the quality of the hay, both as regards\r\npalatability and digestibility. Much that has been said as to the\r\ncuring of medium red clover will also apply to Japan clover.\r\n\r\nSuccessive crops of hay may be grown from year to year on the same land,\r\nas already intimated. (See page 285.) But where other crops are wanted\r\non the same farm, it would be wiser to grow these in some sort of\r\nalternation or succession with the clover crops, so that the former\r\ncould feed upon the nitrogen brought to the land by the clover.\r\n\r\n=Securing Seed.=--Japan clover is ready for being harvested when the\r\nmajor portion of the seeds are ripe. This is late in the season. The\r\nseed crop is more easily gathered when grown on good land, owing to the\r\nmore upright habit of growth. The self-rake reaper is probably the best\r\nimplement for cutting, since it lays it off in loose sheaves, and on\r\nwell-prepared land it may be made to cut so low as to gather the bulk of\r\nthe seed. But it may also be cut with the field mower as small white\r\nclover is frequently cut. (See page 275.) Owing to the lateness of the\r\nseason at which the seed matures, careful and prompt attention may be\r\nnecessary to secure the seed crop without loss, owing to the moistness\r\nwhich characterizes the weather at that season.\r\n\r\nWhen Japan clover is to be harvested for seed, care should be taken to\r\nprevent weeds from ripening their seeds in the same. With a view to\r\nprevent this, it will be found helpful in many instances to run the\r\nmower over the field some time after the clover has begun to grow freely\r\nin the late spring or early summer. Such clipping will also have the\r\neffect of securing more uniformity in the ripening of the seed.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be threshed in much the same way as other clover seed. (See\r\npage 107.) The yields per acre should run from 3 to 8 bushels. It weighs\r\n20 pounds per bushel.\r\n\r\n=Renewing.=--Since Japan clover is an annual, it is not necessary to\r\nrenew it, in the sense in which more long-lived clovers are renewed, as,\r\nfor instance, the alsike variety. (See page 216.) About the only renewal\r\npracticable is that which insures successive crops of pasture, hay or\r\nseed from the same land where the crop has once been grown. (See page\r\n285.) But the growth may, of course, be stimulated by the application of\r\ndressings of fertilizer, such as gypsum, or those that may be termed\r\npotassic in character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBURR CLOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nBurr Clover (_Medicago maculata_) is sometimes called Spotted Medick and\r\nsometimes California clover, also Yellow clover. The name burr clover\r\nhas doubtless arisen from the closely coiled seed pod, which, being\r\ncovered with curved prickles, adhere to wool more or less as burrs do.\r\nThe name Spotted Medick has been given because of the dark spot found in\r\nthe middle of the leaflets, in conjunction with the family of plants to\r\nwhich it belongs. The name California clover is given because of the\r\nclaim that it was much grown in California after having been introduced\r\nthere from Chili, and the name yellow clover, from the color of the\r\nblossoms. After its introduction into the United States, seedsmen sell\r\nCalifornia and Southern burr clover as two varieties, but the\r\ncorrectness of the distinction thus made has been questioned. Many\r\npersons were wont to confuse it with alfalfa, or, as it is frequently\r\ncalled, lucerne, but the latter is much more upright in its habit of\r\ngrowth, grows to a greater height, has more blossoms, blue in color, and\r\nseed pods more loosely coiled. It is also to be distinguished from a\r\nvariety (_Medicago denticulata_) which bears much resemblance to it, and\r\nwhich, growing wild over portions of the plains and foothills of the\r\nWest, affords considerable pasture.\r\n\r\nBurr clover may properly be termed a winter annual, since the seed comes\r\nup in the autumn, furnishes grazing in the winter and spring, and dies\r\nwith the advent of summer. It is procumbent or spreading and branched.\r\nOn good soil some of the plants radiate to the distance of several feet\r\nfrom the parent root. They have been known to overlap, and thus\r\naccumulate until the ground was covered 2 feet deep with this clover,\r\nthus making it very difficult to plow them under. It is only under the\r\nmost favorable conditions, however, that the plants produce such a mass\r\nof foliage. The leaves are composed of three somewhat large leaflets.\r\nThe flowers, as previously intimated, are yellow, and there are but two\r\nor three in each cluster, but the clusters are numerous; hence, also the\r\npods are numerous. They are about 1/4 of an inch broad, and when mature\r\nare possessed of considerable food value.\r\n\r\nBurr clover grows chiefly during the winter, and is at its best for\r\npasture during the months of March and April, and in the Gulf States\r\ndies down after having produced seed in May. Though it is frequently\r\nsown, it has the power of self-propagation to a marked degree, which\r\nmakes it possible to grow many crops in succession without re-seeding by\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIt is not considered a good hay plant, but its value for pasture is\r\nconsiderable, although, as a rule, animals do not take kindly to it at\r\nfirst, as they do to alfalfa or medium red clover, but later they become\r\nfond of it, but less so, probably, in the case of horses than of other\r\nanimals. Being a legume, it is helpful in enriching the land, and being\r\na free grower, it improves the soil mechanically through its root\r\ngrowth, and also through the stems and leaves, when these are plowed\r\nunder.\r\n\r\n=Distribution.=--Burr clover is said to be native to Europe and North\r\nAfrica, but not to North America, although it has shown high adaptation\r\nin adapting itself to conditions as found in the latter.\r\n\r\nAlthough this plant is hardy in the South, and, as previously stated,\r\nmakes most of its growth in the winter, it is not sufficiently hardy to\r\nendure the winters far northward. Its highest adaptation is found in\r\nStates around the Gulf of Mexico. It also grows with more or less vigor\r\nas far north as North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas. For these States\r\nits adaptation is, on the whole, higher than crimson clover, although\r\nwhere the latter will grow readily it is considered the valuable plant\r\nof the two.\r\n\r\nFor Canada, burr clover has no mission, owing to the sternness of the\r\nwinter climate in that country.\r\n\r\n=Soils.=--While burr clover will grow with more or less success on\r\nalmost any kind of soil possessed of a reasonable amount of fertility\r\nand moisture, it is much better adapted to soils alluvial in character\r\nand moist, as, for instance, the deposit soils in the bottom of rivers.\r\nIts power to fight the battle of existence on poor lands is much less\r\nthan that of Japan clover, but on soils that grow crops, such as corn or\r\ncotton, it may be made to render a service which the other cannot,\r\nsince it grows chiefly in winter and early spring, whereas Japan clover\r\ngrows in the summer and early autumn, when cultivated crops occupy the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n=Place in the Rotation.=--Burr clover is grown more in the sense of a\r\ncatch crop and for pasture than in that of a crop to be marketed\r\ndirectly. Since it is grown in the winter and spring, it may be made to\r\ncome in between various crops. On good producing lands of the South it\r\nhas given satisfaction as a pasture plant for winter for many successive\r\nyears without re-sowing by hand, when sown in conjunction with crab\r\ngrass (_Panicum sanguinale_) for hay. Dr. Phares grew it thus in\r\nMississippi for about 20 years. In June crab grass sprang up on the\r\nground, and being cut when in blossom, produced a good crop of hay in\r\nAugust. A lighter cutting was again taken in October. The clover then\r\ntook possession of the land and was grazed until spring, but not so\r\nclosely as to prevent re-seeding in May, after which the plants died\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nBy thus allowing the plants to mature seed, any crop may follow that can\r\nbe grown after May. By following burr clover with cow peas, land may be\r\nmuch fertilized in one year. By reversing the process on land low in\r\nfertility, that is, sowing the peas first and the clover later, a much\r\nbetter growth of the clover will be secured. The seed may also be sown\r\nin corn and cotton crops, with a view to enriching the land. But it is\r\nonly in the Gulf States that much attention is given to growing burr\r\nclover thus, and for the reason, probably, that the winters are too\r\ncold to admit of the plants furnishing a sufficiency of grazing at that\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nBurr clover is sometimes grown with Bermuda grass. The latter furnishes\r\nsummer grazing. There is some merit in the plan, if the seed of the burr\r\nclover were sown from year to year. When the re-seeding of the plants is\r\ndepended on from season to season there is difficulty in adjusting the\r\ngrazing so as to admit of the plants properly re-seeding for the growth\r\nthat is to follow. If the Bermuda grass is not closely grazed many of\r\nthe burrs which contain the seeds may not reach the ground in time to\r\ngerminate.\r\n\r\n=Preparing the Soil.=--Since burr clover has much power to re-seed the\r\nland without preparation, it is more commonly reproduced thus. But, as\r\nwith all other plants, it will grow more quickly and more luxuriantly on\r\na well-prepared seed-bed, where it may be thought worth while to thus\r\nprepare the land. The cultivation given to such crops as corn, cotton or\r\ncow peas makes an excellent preparation of the soil on which to sow burr\r\nclover.\r\n\r\n=Sowing.=--Usually, burr clover is allowed to re-seed itself after it\r\nhas once become established in the soil. In this respect it is not\r\nunlike small white clover and Japan clover, but it does not grow so well\r\nas these on poor soil. Where not yet established, it must, of course, be\r\nsown where it is desired to grow it.\r\n\r\nThe seed is commonly sown in September or early October, but some\r\ngrowers recommend sowing in the burrs as early as June or July, that the\r\ntough surrounding which encloses the seed may have time to decay. When\r\nseed separate from the burr is used, it is sown in the months named.\r\nWhen sown on well-prepared soil, grazing should be plentiful from\r\nFebruary onward.\r\n\r\nBurr clover is more commonly sown in the burr. The burrs are usually\r\nscattered by hand and on land that has been pulverized, but it is easily\r\npossible, when the conditions are favorable, to obtain a stand on land\r\nthat has not been plowed. Where seed is scarce, the burrs are sometimes\r\nplanted in squares 3 feet apart each way, a limited number of burrs\r\nbeing dropped at one time. When thus planted, 1 bushel of burrs will\r\nplant several acres. The plants will soon possess all the ground, but to\r\nenable them to do so, pasturing must be deferred for one season. Whether\r\nsown in the burr or otherwise, it is better to cover the seed with the\r\nharrow.\r\n\r\nOne bushel of burrs weighs from 10 to 12 pounds. It has been stated 1\r\nbushel of clean seed weighs 60 pounds. When sown in the burr, it is\r\nusual to sow 3 to 5 bushels per acre, but in some instances less is sown\r\nand in some more. When seed apart from the burr is sown 12 pounds per\r\nacre should suffice. In some instances it is sown on Bermuda sod, but\r\nthe attempts to grow it thus have not always proved satisfactory. At the\r\nLouisiana Experiment Station it was found that the burr clover remained\r\nlong enough and grew large enough to injure the Bermuda. Possibly closer\r\ngrazing would have prevented such injury. When sown on Bermuda grass,\r\nJune, July or August are the months chosen for scattering the seed.\r\n\r\nBurr clover is also sometimes sown in corn and cotton to provide winter\r\ngrazing, but when thus sown the object more frequently sought is to\r\nenrich the land. Both ends may be accomplished in some degree.\r\n\r\n=Pasturing.=--Opinions differ as to the palatability of this grass. All\r\nare agreed that stock do not take kindly to it at first, but that they\r\ncome to relish it at least reasonably well when accustomed to it. It is\r\nsaid to be relished less by horses and mules than by other domestic\r\nanimals. It has been praised as a pasture for swine. It is more\r\npalatable in the early stages of its growth, and will bear close\r\ngrazing, and also severe tramping. It will provide pasture for six\r\nmonths, but not so bountifully in the first months of growing as later.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting for Hay.=--Burr clover is not a good hay plant. Owing to the\r\nrecumbent character of the growth it is not easily mowed, nor has it\r\nmuch palatability in the cured form. The yield is said to be from 1/2 to\r\n1 ton per acre.\r\n\r\n=Securing Seed.=--In the Gulf States the seed matures in April and May.\r\nThe plants grow seed profusely. Sown in October, stock may usually be\r\nallowed free access to it until March, and if then removed, it will\r\nspring up quickly and mature seed so profusely that when the plants die\r\nand partially decay seed may sometimes be collected in hollows, into\r\nwhich it has been driven by the wind. It is more commonly sown in the\r\nburr form, the form in which it is usually gathered. The more common\r\nmethod of saving the seed, as given by Mr. A. H. Beattie of Starkville,\r\nMississippi, is to first rake off the dead vines so as to leave the\r\nburrs on the ground and then sweep them together with a suitable wire or\r\nstreet broom. It is then lifted and run through two sets of sifters of\r\nsuitable mesh by hand to remove the trash swept up in gathering the\r\nseed. It is probable that other methods more economical of labor are yet\r\nto be devised when harvesting the seed crop. As much as 100 bushels of\r\nburrs have been obtained from an acre, but that is considerably more\r\nthan the average yield of seed.\r\n\r\n=Renewing.=--Since this plant is an annual, it cannot be renewed in the\r\nsense in which renewal is possible with a perennial. But as has been\r\nshown above (see page 294), it may be grown annually for an indefinite\r\nperiod in the same land and without re-sowing by hand. It has also been\r\nshown that by sowing the seed in certain crops at the proper season,\r\nfrom year to year, it may be made to grow from year to year where the\r\nrotation will admit of this. (See page 295.) When the ground is well\r\nstored with seed, the plants will continue to come up freely in the soil\r\nfor at least two or three years, even without any re-seeding of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n=As a Fertilizer.=--The growing of burr clover exercises a beneficial\r\ninfluence on the land. Its value for this purpose, since it can be grown\r\nas a catch crop, is probably greater than its value in providing food\r\nfor stock. Like all plants that are more or less creeping in their habit\r\nof growth, it shades the soil and keeps it moist, which, in conjunction\r\nwith the influence of the roots, puts it in a friable condition. When\r\nthe plants grow rankly, it is not easy to bury them properly with the\r\nordinary plow, but in such instances, if cut up with a disk harrow, the\r\nwork is facilitated. The plants quickly die down so as to make plowing\r\neasily possible, but the aim should be to have such decay take place\r\nwithin the soil rather than above it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet clover is so named from the sweet odor which emanates from the\r\nliving plants. It is of two species. These are designated, respectively,\r\n_Melilotus alba_ and _Melilotus officinalis_. The former is also called\r\nBokhara clover, White Melilot and Tree clover. It is possibly more\r\nwidely known by the name Bokhara than by any other designation. The\r\nlatter is sometimes called Yellow clover. The difference between these\r\nin appearance and habits of growth does not seem to be very marked,\r\nexcept that the blossoms of the former are white and those of the latter\r\nare yellow.\r\n\r\nSweet clover is upright and branched in its habit of growth. It attains\r\nto a height of from 2 to 8 feet, according to the soil in which the\r\nplants grow. The somewhat small and truncate leaves are not so numerous,\r\nrelatively, as with some other varieties of clover, and the stems are\r\nwoody in character, especially as they grow older. The blossoms are\r\nsmall and white or yellow, according to the variety, and the seed pods\r\nare black when ripe. The roots are large and more or less branched, and\r\ngo down to a great depth in the soil; especially is this true of the\r\nmain, or tap root.\r\n\r\nThe plants, according to Beale, are annual or biennial, but more\r\ncommonly they are biennial. They do not usually blossom the year that\r\nthey are sown, but may blossom within a year from the date of sowing.\r\nFor instance, when sown in the early autumn, they may bloom the\r\nfollowing summer. They are exceedingly hardy, having much power to\r\nendure extremes of heat and cold, and to grow in poor soils and under\r\nadverse conditions. In some soils they take possession of road sides and\r\nvacant lands, and continue to grow in these for successive years. The\r\nimpaction of such soils by stock treading on them seems rather to\r\nadvance than to hinder the growth. They start growing early in the\r\nspring and grow quickly, especially the second year. They come into\r\nbloom in June, early or later, according to the latitude, and ordinarily\r\nonly in the year following that in which they were sown. Because of the\r\nfragrant odor which is emitted from the plants as they grow, they are\r\nsometimes introduced into gardens and ornamental grounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Sweet Clover (_Melilotus alba_)\r\n  Tennessee Experiment Station]\r\n\r\nThe uses of the plants are at least three. It has some value as a food\r\nfor live stock. It has much value as a fertilizer. It has probably even\r\nmore value as a food for bees. It has also been used in binding soils.\r\nIts value as a food for stock has probably been overestimated. It is\r\nbitter, notwithstanding the fragrant odor that emanates from it; hence,\r\nit is not relished by stock, insomuch that they will not eat it when\r\nthey can get other food that is more palatable. As hay, it is hard to\r\ncure and of doubtful palatability when cured. As a fertilizer, its value\r\ndoes not seem to have been sufficiently recognized, and the same is\r\nprobably true of it as bee pasture, although many bee-keepers are alive\r\nto its great merit for such a use.\r\n\r\nThis plant does not seem to find much favor with many. The United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture has spoken of it as a \"weedy biennial,\r\nconcerning which extravagant claims have been made.\" The laws of some\r\nStates proscribe it as a weed, and impose penalties directed against any\r\nwho allow it to grow. Legislatures should be slow to class a legume as a\r\nweed, especially one that has much power to enrich soils. The author\r\ncherishes the opinion that this plant has a mission in the economy of\r\nagriculture and of considerable importance to farmers, especially in\r\nsoils that are poor and worn, as soon as they come to understand it\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n=Distribution.=--Sweet clover is probably indigenous to the semi-arid\r\nregions of Asia. The name Bokhara would seem to indicate as much, but it\r\nis also found in many parts of Europe, and if the facts were known, was\r\ndoubtless brought from Europe to North America by the first settlers.\r\nFor many decades it has been represented in many flower gardens in all\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe plant will endure almost any amount of cold when it is once\r\nestablished. It has stood well the winters of Manitoba. It can also\r\nendure extreme summer heat, since it thrives well in some parts of\r\nTexas. It grows most vigorously where the rainfall is abundant, as in\r\nWestern Oregon, and it makes a strong growth in the dry areas of Western\r\nKansas and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nSweet clover will grow vigorously in some part or parts of every State\r\nin the Union. Of course, it has higher adaptation for some conditions\r\nthan others. In some of the Central and Southern States, it has\r\nmultiplied to such an extent without cultivation as to have assumed the\r\ncharacter of a weed; hence, the legislation against it. When it is\r\ncalled to mind that this plant is a legume, and when the further fact is\r\nrecognized that it may be used not only in enriching soils, but at the\r\nsame time improving them mechanically, in addition to other benefits\r\nthat it may be made to render, surely the enactments which prohibit its\r\ngrowth should be repealed in any State where these exist. In the\r\nNorthern States, with a normal rainfall, the mission of this plant is\r\nlikely to be circumscribed, for the reason that other legumes possessed\r\nof a much higher food value may be grown in these. In the Southern\r\nStates, its mission will be more important, since it may be used in some\r\nof these with decided advantage in binding soils and in renovating them,\r\neven when too poor to produce a vigorous growth of cow peas. It is\r\nlikely also that it may yet be made to render good service in the\r\nsemi-arid country west of the Mississippi River, where other clovers\r\ncannot be grown.\r\n\r\nSweet clover will grow in all the provinces of Canada. For economic\r\nuses, however, it is not likely to grow to any great extent east of Lake\r\nSuperior, or west of the Rocky Mountains. Other legumes more useful may\r\nbe grown in these areas. But in the intervening wheat-growing region it\r\nis possible that it may come to be used for purposes of soil\r\nrenovation.\r\n\r\n=Soils.=--But little can be gleaned from American sources on this\r\nsubject. Notwithstanding, it may be said with safety that it has greater\r\npower to grow on poor, worn and hard soils than any forage plant that\r\nhas yet been introduced into America for economic uses.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be found true of it, as of other clovers, that it will\r\nthrive best on soils that have produced timber, and more especially\r\ntimber of the hardwood varieties. This means, therefore, that it will\r\ngrow well in probably all kinds of clay soils and also in loam soils\r\nunderlaid with clay. It has high adaptation for soils abounding in lime.\r\nIt can be made to succeed on hard clay subsoils from which the surface\r\nsoil has been removed. But it will also grow well on sandy soils and\r\neven on gravels when a reasonable amount of moisture is present. The\r\nauthor succeeded in growing it in good form in 1897 and 1898 in a vacant\r\nlot in St. Paul, from which 6 to 8 feet of surface soil had been removed\r\na short time previously. The subsoil was so sandy that it would almost\r\nhave answered for building uses.\r\n\r\nThis clover will probably grow with least success on soils of the\r\nprairie so light in texture as to lift with the winds, and in which the\r\nunderlying clay is several feet from the surface, also in slough soils\r\nthat are much saturated with water.\r\n\r\nSince it grows vigorously on road sides, in rocky waste places and even\r\nin brick yards when sown without a covering, the idea has gained\r\ncurrency that the harder the soil, the better the plants will grow, and\r\nthe more surely will they be established in the soil; but this view does\r\nnot seem to be in accord with the principles which usually govern plant\r\ngrowth. It will, however, send its roots down into hard subsoils so\r\ndeeply that in certain seasons the plants could not be dug up without\r\nthe aid of a pick.\r\n\r\n=Place in the Rotation.=--Since sweet clover seed is more commonly\r\nscattered in byplaces, or is self-sown from plants that have run wild,\r\nit can scarcely be said that it has ever been grown as a regular crop\r\nand in a regular rotation. Nor is it ever likely to become a factor in\r\nsuch a rotation unless its properties shall be so modified that it can\r\nbe grown acceptably as a pasture plant. In such an event it would have\r\nthe same place in the rotation as other clovers; that is, it would\r\nnaturally follow a cultivated, that is, a cleaning crop, and precede\r\nsome crop or a succession of crops that would profit from the nitrogen\r\nand humus which it had brought to the soil, and also from the influence\r\nwhich the roots would exercise mechanically upon the same. But the\r\nnecessity for sowing it on clean ground would not be so great as with\r\nthe other clovers, since it has greater power than these to overshadow\r\nweeds when the two grow together.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, this plant will probably continue to be grown as in the\r\npast; that is, if sown, it will be sown: 1. In byplaces to provide\r\npasture for bees, in which case in time it will be superseded by other\r\nplants. 2. On worn lands so poor that they refuse to grow valuable food\r\nproducts sown, partly, at least, with a view to renovate them. And 3. In\r\ncuttings made by railroads and in gullies that have been made in fields,\r\nwith a view to prevent soil movement. It may also come to be sown in\r\ngrain crops in localities where other varieties of clover will not grow,\r\nto be plowed under the following spring.\r\n\r\n=Preparing the Soil.=--Since sweet clover will grow on the firmest and\r\nmost forbidding soils, even when self-sown, it would not seem necessary,\r\nordinarily, to spend much time in specially preparing a seed-bed for it.\r\nThe fact stated is proof of its ability to grow on a firm surface. It\r\ndoes not follow, however, that such a condition of the seed-bed will\r\ngive a better stand of the plants than a pulverized condition of the\r\nsame, as some have contended. It may be that on soils that are quite\r\nloose near the surface, and under conditions that incline to dry a\r\nseed-bed firm and even hard, may be more conductive to growth in the\r\nplants than one in which the conditions are the opposite. Much rolling\r\nof loose soils has been recommended when preparing the seed-bed with a\r\nview to firm them.\r\n\r\nWhen the seed is sown along with grain, the preparation of the soil\r\nneeded for grain would be ample preparation also for the clover. When\r\nsown on stubble land, in many instances no preparation by way of\r\nstirring the soil would seem necessary. And when sown on railroad\r\nembankments, road sides, rocky situations and byplaces generally no\r\npreparation of the soil would be possible.\r\n\r\n=Sowing.=--In the North sweet clover is best sown in the spring. In\r\nfact, it can only be sown then with the assurance that it will survive\r\nthe winter north of a certain limit. That limit will vary with altitude,\r\nbut it will probably run irregularly across the Middle States, from the\r\nAtlantic westward to the Cascade Mountains, beyond which it will veer\r\naway to the North. In the Southern States, it may be sown fall or\r\nspring, but if sown late in the fall the young plants will in some\r\ninstances succumb to the frost of winter. Early fall sowing, therefore,\r\nis much to be preferred to sowing late.\r\n\r\nThe method of sowing may be the same as in sowing medium red clover (see\r\npage 78); that is, when the seed is sown with grain crops. When sown in\r\nbyplaces, it will ordinarily be sown by hand. In such places it will\r\nre-seed itself and will likely grow in these for successive seasons. On\r\nrailroad embankments, the seed is scattered more commonly on the upper\r\nportion, and from the plants which grow there the seeds produced scatter\r\ndownward. The plants not only lessen washing in the soil, but they\r\nprepare the same for the growth of grasses. They also aid thus in the\r\nintroduction of grasses into rocky and very hard soils.\r\n\r\nSweet clover may be sown with almost any kind of a nurse crop desired,\r\nwhich does not destroy it with an over-abundant shade. Or it may be sown\r\nalone where such a necessity exists. But the instances are not numerous\r\nin which it would be desirable or necessary to sow it alone on arable\r\nsoils. There may be conditions when it could be sown successfully at the\r\ntime of the last cultivation given to corn and with a view to soil\r\nenrichment.\r\n\r\nSince sweet clover is seldom sown for the purpose of providing food for\r\nlive stock, it is not sown in mixtures, nor is it well adapted for being\r\nsown thus, because of the large and luxuriant character of the growth,\r\nwhich would tend to smother other plants sown along with it.\r\n\r\nThe amount of seed to sow has been variously stated at from 15 to 20\r\npounds per acre. The smaller amount should be enough for almost any\r\npurpose, and a much smaller amount should suffice for sowing in byplaces\r\nand along road sides, where the plants retain possession of the ground\r\nthrough self-seeding.\r\n\r\n=Pasturing.=--Because of the bitter aromatic principle which it\r\ncontains, known as commarin, stock dislike it, especially at the first.\r\nAnd it is questionable if they can be educated to like it in areas where\r\nother food, which is more palatable, grows abundantly. In an experiment\r\ndirected by the author at the Minnesota University Experiment Station,\r\nsheep pastured upon it, and did not take kindly to it; but by turning\r\nthem in to graze upon it in the morning, they cropped it down. In\r\nlocalities where good grazing is not plentiful, if live stock have\r\naccess to it, especially when the plants are young, they will so crop it\r\ndown that in a few years it will entirely disappear. But where other\r\npastures are abundant, it will continue to grow indefinitely. It would\r\nnot seem wise to sow it for the purpose of providing grazing, unless\r\nwhere the conditions for growing other and better grazing are\r\nunfavorable.\r\n\r\nSome have spoken favorably of sweet clover for soiling uses. It makes a\r\nvery rapid growth quite early in the season, and when cut and wilted\r\nmore or less before being fed, the palatability is thereby considerably\r\nincreased. Small plots of this plant near the outbuildings may in this\r\nway be utilized with some advantage in the absence of better soiling\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting for Hay.=--Sweet clover is not a really good hay plant under\r\nany conditions, and if not cut until it becomes woody, is practically\r\nvalueless for hay. It ought to be cut for hay a little before the stage\r\nof bloom. If cutting is longer deferred, the plants become woody. Such\r\nearly cutting, however, adds much to the difficulty of curing the crop,\r\nsince, while naturally succulent, its succulence is then, of course,\r\nconsiderably more than at a later period. It should be cured like medium\r\nred clover. (See page 96.) If not cut sufficiently early, and cured with\r\nas much care as is exercised in curing alfalfa, there will be\r\nconsiderable loss from the shedding of the leaves.\r\n\r\nMore commonly the plants are not cut for hay the year that they are\r\nsown, but some seasons such harvesting is entirely practicable in\r\ncertain situations. The hay crop or crops are usually taken the second\r\nyear. Sometimes the crop is cut twice. It is entirely practicable to\r\nobtain two cuttings under ordinary conditions, because of the vigor in\r\nthe growth, and because of the early season at which it must be\r\nharvested for hay. From 3 to 4 or 5 tons may thus be obtained in many\r\ninstances from the two cuttings.\r\n\r\n=Securing Seed.=--Nearly all of the seed sown in this country is\r\nimported. The author has not been able to obtain information with\r\nreference to growing seed within the United States; hence, the inference\r\nis fair that but little of it has been grown for that purpose up to the\r\npresent time. Since, however, it seeds freely, and since the price of\r\nseed is high, seed crops, more especially when the plants are also\r\nutilized as bee pasture, ought to prove remunerative in the hands of\r\njudicious growers.\r\n\r\nThe seed crop is obtained usually, if not always, the second year after\r\nthe sowing. If cut for hay before coming into bloom, it will grow up\r\nagain and bear seed profusely. This would seem preferable on strong\r\nsoils, as it would prevent that rankness in growth which would militate\r\nagainst abundant seed production, and which would add much to the labor\r\nof handling the crop.\r\n\r\nThe seed crop may be cut and handled in substantially the same way as\r\nmedium red clover when grown for seed. It may also be cured and thrashed\r\nessentially in the same way. (See page 105.) The author has not been\r\nable to obtain information with reference to the average yield of the\r\nseed crop under American conditions. The seed, like that of the medium\r\nred variety, should weigh 60 pounds per bushel.\r\n\r\n=Renewing.=--In the sense of a pasture or hay crop, it would not seem\r\nnecessary to try to renew this crop, because of the relatively low value\r\nwhich it possesses for these uses. When grown for bee pasture, it will\r\nrenew itself for an indefinite period when the plants are not cut for\r\nseed and where the conditions are favorable to growth. When grown to\r\nkeep soils from washing or railroad embankments from breaking down, it\r\nwill, of course, renew itself in the same way. In time, however, it is\r\nusually superseded by some kind of grass, for which it has prepared the\r\nway by the ameliorating and renewing influence which it exerts upon the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n=Value for Bee Pasture.=--All authorities are agreed as to the high\r\nvalue of this plant as a honey producer. The claim has been made for it\r\nthat for such a use it is more valuable acre for acre than any ordinary\r\ngrain crop. By cutting a part of the crop before it comes into bloom,\r\nthe season of honey production may be prolonged from, say, July 1st\r\nuntil some time in the autumn, as the part thus cut will come into bloom\r\nafter the blooms have left the plants that were cut. When not disturbed,\r\nsweet clover yields honey in the interval between the blooming of the\r\nbasswood and the golden rod. The honey is of excellent quality. There\r\nshould be no good reasons, therefore, why bee-keepers should not sow the\r\nseed in by and waste places. But the wisdom of growing it as a\r\nhoney-producing crop on valuable land where other honey crops, as alsike\r\nand white clover, can be grown in good form may be questioned.\r\n\r\n=Value as a Fertilizer.=--The high value of this plant as a fertilizer\r\nand soil improver cannot be questioned. But whether it should ever be\r\nsown for such a use will depend on the capacity of the soil to produce\r\nother crops valuable for fertilizing and also more valuable for\r\nproducing forage or fodder. Where other clovers more useful can be\r\ngrown, also cow peas, soy beans and other legumes valuable for food\r\nuses, it would seem unwise to sow sweet clover. This would restrict its\r\nuse, therefore, as a soil renovator; first, to soils too poor to grow\r\nthose useful legumes; second, to areas where the climate conditions will\r\nnot admit of the growth of these; and third, to areas from which the\r\nsurface soil has been removed, and which it is desirable to so\r\nameliorate and improve the soil thus laid bare that it could later be\r\ncovered with some more valuable cover crop. Under present conditions\r\nthis would restrict its growth for the purpose named to sandy and\r\ngravelly soils, to certain areas in the semi-arid region east of the\r\nRocky Mountains, and to such small areas as the surface soil had been\r\nremoved from.\r\n\r\nIn the semi-arid region where crops of grain and also some varieties of\r\nfield corn can be grown successfully, but where the clovers are not\r\nsuccessful; it would seem practicable to sow a few pounds of sweet\r\nclover seed per acre at the same time as the grains, and to plow under\r\nthe plants produced some time in the month of May the next season. The\r\nclover thus buried could be at once followed by corn or potatoes, or,\r\nindeed, by any kind of a cleaning crop. The high price of seed at\r\npresent practically forbids growing clover thus.\r\n\r\nWhether sweet clover grown for renovating uses should be turned under\r\nthe season in which it has been sown will depend largely on the growth\r\nthat has been made. In many instances, the growth made is so rank as to\r\njustify plowing it under the following autumn. In other instances,\r\nbetter results will follow plowing it under the next season. It\r\nfrequently happens that the growth made is so rank that a strong plow\r\nand also a strong team are necessary to do the work properly.\r\n\r\n=Value on Alkali soils.=--This plant has been grown to some extent to\r\naid in removing alkali from soils superabundantly impregnated with the\r\nsame. It will grow, it is claimed, under certain conditions on such\r\nsoils so surcharged with alkali as to prohibit almost every other form\r\nof vegetable growth. The extent to which it may be thus used profitably\r\nhad not yet been fully demonstrated. But where it can be grown on such\r\nsoils, the fact that it takes up and removes relatively large quantities\r\nof alkali would appear to be well established.\r\n\r\n=Destroying the Plants.=--Should the conditions be found so favorable to\r\nthe growth of the plant that it persists in growing where it is not\r\nwanted, it will soon cease to appear, if prevented from going to seed.\r\nOrdinarily, the blossoms appear only during the second year of growth.\r\nIf, therefore, the plants are cut off when in bloom, seed forming will\r\nnot only be prevented, but since sweet clover is a biennial, the plants\r\nwill die. When thus dealt with, the only source from which other plants\r\nmay come while extermination is being thus sought is from seed lodged in\r\nthe soil and still capable of germinating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS VARIETIES OF CLOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the varieties of clover that have been discussed at some\r\nlength in previous chapters are a number the value of which may be\r\nconsiderable to areas more or less local and limited. These include\r\nSainfoin, Egyptian clover, Yellow clover, Sand lucerne, Japanese clover,\r\nBeggarweed and Seaside clover. Some of these, as Sainfoin and Buffalo\r\nclover, have been in the country for several years, and yet but little\r\nis known as to their behavior, except in very limited areas. Others, as\r\nBuffalo clover, native to the country are thought to have merit, and yet\r\nthe degree of such merit does not appear to have been yet proved under\r\ncultivation. The three varieties but recently introduced are thought to\r\nhave considerable promise for certain soils and climates to which they\r\nhave special adaptation, but sufficient trial has not been given them to\r\ndetermine even approximately the measure of their worth to this country.\r\nThese varieties will now be discussed, but for the reasons stated above\r\nit will be manifest that the discussion will of necessity be imperfect\r\nand fragmentary in character.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINFOIN\r\n\r\nSainfoin (_Onobrychis sativa_) is a perennial, leguminous, clover-like\r\nforage plant of the bean family. The word Sainfoin is equivalent to the\r\nFrench words for sound or wholesome hay. It is also frequently called\r\nEsparcette or Asperset, more especially in Germany. It is further known\r\nin England by the name Cock's Head, French Grass and Medick Vetchling.\r\nIn some parts of France and Switzerland the name has been and probably\r\nis yet applied to lucerne (_Medicago sativa_).\r\n\r\nIn its habit of growth it is more woody in the rootstock than clover and\r\nmore branched. It also grows to a greater average height. The stems,\r\nwhich are covered with fine hairs, bear numerous leaves long and\r\npinnate. The blossoms are numerous and of an attractive, pinkish color,\r\nbrightening into a crimson tint. The seed pods are flattened from side\r\nto side and wrinkled, and are also sickle-shaped. They bear but one\r\nseed. The roots are strong and more or less branched.\r\n\r\nSainfoin, as already intimated, is perennial in its habit of growth.\r\nWhen a field is once well set with the plants, it should continue to\r\nproduce crops for a decade, but will eventually be crowded out with\r\nweeds or other grasses. It grows very early in the season, quite as\r\nearly, if not earlier, than alfalfa, and continues to grow until autumn.\r\n\r\nThe feeding value of sainfoin is much the same as that of alfalfa. It is\r\nmuch esteemed where it can be grown for the production of pasture, of\r\nsoiling food, and also hay, valuable for enriching the land, through the\r\nmedium of the roots, and also when the tops are plowed under as green\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nSainfoin is native throughout the whole of Central Europe and over\r\nmuch of Siberia. Although native to the southern counties of England, it\r\ndoes not appear to have been cultivated there before the year 1651, at\r\nwhich time it is said to have been introduced from Flanders. From what\r\nhas been said with reference to the distribution of sainfoin in Europe\r\nand Asia, it will be apparent that it is a hardy plant, which has\r\nhighest adaptation for climates temperate and mild to moderately cool.\r\nIts hardihood has been shown by its surviving the winters in the\r\nlatitude of the St. Lawrence River, but the abundant snow covering then\r\nprovided should not be lost sight of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Sainfoin (_Onobrychis sativa_)\r\n  Oregon Experiment Station]\r\n\r\nIts adaptation to the United States does not appear to have been proved\r\nyet, except in limited areas. In some of the Montana valleys good crops\r\nhave been grown with much success in many of those western valleys, and\r\neven on the bench lands at the base of foothills. Nor would there seem\r\nto be any good reasons for supposing that good crops could not be grown\r\nin various parts of the United States where the soil is suitable.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, sainfoin has succeeded in Quebec. In trials made by the\r\nauthor at the Ontario Agricultural College at Guelph success was only\r\npartial, but the trials were limited. There would seem to be no good\r\nreasons why this plant should not succeed in many places in Canada where\r\nlimestone soils prevail.\r\n\r\nThis plant is best adapted to dry soils calcareous in their composition\r\nand somewhat porous in character. This explains its great affinity for\r\nthe chalk soils which abound in the south of England. On the dry,\r\nlimestone soils of this country it ought to succeed. It has shown much\r\nadaptation for the volcanic soils of the Western mountain region, where\r\nit has been tried. On stiff clays it grows too slowly to be entirely\r\nsatisfactory. It ought not to be sown on soils wet or swampy in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nSince sainfoin is perennial in its habit of growth, and since, when once\r\nwell set, it will retain its hold upon the soil for several years, it is\r\nnot in the strict sense of the term a rotation plant. When it is grown,\r\nhowever, it should be followed by crops which require large quantities\r\nof nitrogen easily accessible, to enable them to complete their growth.\r\nIf this plant should ever be grown to any considerable extent in the\r\nmountain States, much that has been said with reference to the place for\r\nalfalfa in the rotation will also apply to sainfoin. (See page 135.)\r\n\r\nIt has been found more difficult to get a good stand of sainfoin plants\r\nthan of other varieties of the clover family. This is owing to the low\r\ngerminating power frequently found in the seed. The stand of plants is\r\nfrequently found to be too thin and scattering. Weeds, therefore, and\r\nsometimes grasses are much liable to come into the soil occupied by the\r\nsainfoin and to crowd the same. Because of this it is specially\r\nimportant that sainfoin shall be sown on a clean seed-bed.\r\n\r\nThe seed is very frequently sown in the hull, and usually in the early\r\nspring. But there would seem to be no reasons why the seed should not be\r\nsown in the early autumn in localities where alfalfa can be sown thus.\r\n(See page 145.) In the rough form, it is usually broadcasted by hand,\r\nbut would probably also feed through a seed drill. When sown apart from\r\nthe hull, the seed may be sown by the same methods as alfalfa. (See page\r\n147.) In the rough form, from 3 to 5 bushels per acre are sown. In the\r\nclean form, it is claimed that 40 pounds of seed should be sown, but\r\nthat amount of clean and good seed would seem to be excessive on\r\nwell-prepared land. The seed in the hull weighs 26 pounds per bushel.\r\nThe plan of sowing 2 to 3 pounds per acre of the seed of alsike clover\r\nalong with the sainfoin would doubtless be found helpful under some\r\nconditions, as it would tend to thicken the crop, more especially the\r\nfirst season.\r\n\r\nSainfoin is a good pasture plant when properly grazed. It does not\r\nproduce bloat in cattle or sheep as alfalfa does. In this fact is found\r\none of the strongest reason why it should be grown in areas where\r\nalfalfa is wanted for pasture. It will furnish grazing about as early as\r\nalfalfa, and considerably earlier than medium red clover.\r\n\r\nThis plant is more frequently grown for soiling food than for hay. For\r\nthe former use it has high adaptation, since it will furnish several\r\ncuttings of soiling food per season. It will also furnish two cuttings\r\nof hay, or one of hay and one of seed, and under some conditions more\r\nthan two cuttings can be obtained. In the latitude of Montreal it is\r\nready to be cut for hay during the early days of June. It is ready for\r\nbeing cut when the blossoms begin to expand. Much care is necessary in\r\ncuring the hay, in order to prevent the too free shedding of the leaves.\r\nThe methods for making alfalfa hay will apply also to sainfoin.\r\n\r\nSeed may be obtained from the first or second cutting of the crop. It is\r\nusually obtained from the second cutting, as the yield is much larger\r\nthan that obtained from the first cutting. The author has not been able\r\nto obtain any facts based on experience regarding the harvesting of the\r\nseed crop under American field conditions. But the methods followed in\r\nobtaining seed from alfalfa would probably also answer equally well for\r\nsainfoin. Great care is necessary in handling the seed crop, owing to\r\nthe ease with which the seed shatters. Special pains are also necessary\r\nto keep the germinating power of the seed from injury from overheating.\r\nNor does the seed seem able to retain germinating power as long as the\r\nseeds of some other varieties of clover. In experiments conducted by\r\nProfessor C. A. Zavitz at the Ontario Experiment Station at Guelph in\r\n1902 and 1903, the average yield per acre was 426.1 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN CLOVER\r\n\r\nEgyptian clover (_Trifolium Alexandrianum_) is more commonly known in\r\nthe Nile valley as Berseem. It is of at least three varieties. These are\r\nthe Muscowi, Fachl and Saida, all of which are more or less closely\r\nrelated to medium red clover. The term _Alexandrianum_ as applied above\r\nis somewhat misleading, as its growth is not specially identified with\r\nAlexandria, nor is its growth in Egypt supposed to be of great\r\nantiquity, since no trace of it is found upon the ancient monuments.\r\n\r\nThe Muscowi variety, which is commonly grown more especially in lower\r\nEgypt, sometimes grows to the height of 5 feet and over, but usually it\r\nis not more than half the height named. In its habit of growth it is\r\nrather upright, like alfalfa, but the hollow stems are softer and more\r\nsucculent, and the blossoms occur on heads resembling those of clover,\r\nbut not so compactly formed, and they are white in color. The seeds bear\r\na close resemblance to those of crimson clover. The roots are much\r\nshorter, but more spreading in their habit of growth than those of\r\nalfalfa, and in Egyptian soils they bear small tubercles abundantly.\r\nThis variety, which is usually grown on land that can be irrigated at\r\nany season, produces in some instances 5 cuttings in a season. The Fachl\r\nvariety is usually grown on land irrigated by the basin system; that is,\r\nthe system which covers the land with water but once a year, and for a\r\nperiod more or less prolonged. But one crop a year is taken from such\r\nland. The hay from this variety is heavier for the bulk than that of the\r\nMuscowi. The Saida variety is of a lower habit of growth than the\r\nMuscowi and has a longer tap root, which enables it to stand drought\r\nbetter than the Muscowi. It is more commonly sown in Egypt southward\r\nfrom Cairo.\r\n\r\nAll these varieties are annual. The period of growth covered by any one\r\nof them is never more than 9 months, and usually not more than 6\r\nmonths; that is to say, from October to March. The Muscowi variety\r\nespecially grows very rapidly.\r\n\r\nEgyptian clover in all its varieties is pre-eminently a soiling plant.\r\nIt is sometimes pastured and is also made into hay. It is practically\r\nthe one fodder crop of Egypt, and is more commonly fed in the green\r\nform. All kinds of stock are fond of it, and it is fed freely to horses,\r\ndonkeys and camels at labor, to cows in milk, and to cattle that are\r\nbeing fattened. It also serves to keep Egyptian soils supplied with\r\nnitrogen, for the support of crops grown on them in summer, especially\r\ncotton, and various kinds of grain. Moreover, because of the frequency\r\nof the cuttings, with the Muscowi variety, its growth tends very much to\r\ncheck the growth of weeds.\r\n\r\nEgyptian clover is not native to Egypt, but was introduced from some\r\ncountry outside of Egypt, yet bordering on the Mediterranean. This, at\r\nleast, is the view presented in Bulletin No. 23, issued by the Bureau of\r\nPlant Industry, United States Department of Agriculture, from which\r\nsource much of what is written with reference to this plant has been\r\nobtained. In Egypt more than 1,000,000 acres are grown annually. It is\r\nalso being tried, with much promise, in other portions of Northern\r\nAfrica, as Tunis and Algiers. It is also now being experimented with in\r\nvarious parts of the Southern and Southwestern States.\r\n\r\nEgyptian clover is only adapted to a warm climate. In those parts of the\r\nUnited States which have a climate not unlike that of Egypt, in many\r\nrespects, as Florida, Southern Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, it may\r\nhave an important mission. It may yet be grown in these areas, or some\r\nof them, where irrigation is practiced in conjunction with cotton, or\r\nwith certain of the cereals. If it can be thus grown, it will prove of\r\nmuch value, as it would only occupy the land when not occupied by the\r\ncrops usually grown in summer, and it would bring much fertility to the\r\nsame, in addition to the forage provided. Since in Tunis it has been\r\nfound that the plants have not been killed by cold 2 deg. below zero and in\r\nAlgiers 9 deg. below that point, the hope would seem to be justifiable that\r\nthis clover may yet be grown much further north than the States named.\r\nIf grown thus, however, it should not be as a substitute for alfalfa,\r\nbut rather to occupy the ground in winter when not producing otherwise.\r\nIt may yet be found that the Saida variety may have adaptation for some\r\nlocalities in the West where irrigation cannot be practiced. This clover\r\nis not likely to render any considerable service to any part of Canada,\r\nbecause of the lack of adaptation in the climate.\r\n\r\nEgyptian clover has highest adaptation for deposit soils, such as are\r\nmade by the settling of silt held in solution by waters that overflow.\r\nIn these it will grow with vigor, though they rest upon coarse sand or\r\neven upon gravel not too near the surface. Irrigating waters to some\r\nextent are necessary to grow the plants in best form, although, as\r\npreviously intimated, the Saida variety may yet be grown without the aid\r\nof such waters. It is the first crop sown on reclaimed alkaline lands,\r\nand growing it on these tends to remove the alkali and to sweeten and\r\notherwise improve the soils.\r\n\r\nThe place for this plant in the rotation is readily apparent. Like\r\ncrimson clover, it is clearly a catch crop, as it were, and a winter\r\nplant, but with the difference that it grows much more rapidly under\r\nsuitable conditions and furnishes much more food. The advantage of\r\ngrowing it northward in the Western mountain valleys when sown in\r\nspring, as intimated by the writer of the bulletin already referred to,\r\nwould seem to be at least problematical, since it could not be sown\r\nearly enough in the spring to produce a crop as early as alfalfa already\r\nestablished. It would then be grown also as the crop of the season,\r\nrather than as a catch crop. The place for Egyptian clover in the\r\nrotation is clearly that of a winter crop, to provide soiling food for\r\nstock and plant food for the land, which may be utilized by the summer\r\ncrop that follows.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt the seed is frequently sown on the silt deposited by the waters\r\nthat have subsided and before it would be dry enough to plow. At other\r\ntimes, it is sowed on land stirred on the surface to a greater or less\r\ndepth, and sprouted through the aid of irrigating waters. In the valleys\r\nof the West that preparation of the soil found suitable for alfalfa\r\nwould also, doubtless, be found suitable for this clover.\r\n\r\nThe seed is sown in the autumn in Egypt, usually in October, but the\r\nseason of sowing lasts from September to January, and some crops have\r\nbeen obtained sown as late as April 1st, but when sown late, the number\r\nof the cuttings is reduced and the occupancy of the soil by the clover\r\ninterferes with the growing of other crops. Under American conditions,\r\nit will doubtless be found that the best season for sowing Egyptian\r\nclover will be just after the removal of the crop that occupied the land\r\nin summer. The seed is usually sowed by hand and without admixture, but\r\nthe Fachl variety is sown in some instances with wheat or barley when\r\nseed is wanted. The methods of sowing found suitable for alfalfa would\r\nalso seem to be proper for sowing Egyptian clover. (See page 78.) As\r\nmuch as one bushel of seed is sown per acre, but it is thought that a\r\nless amount will suffice under good methods of tillage.\r\n\r\nEgyptian clover is sometimes pastured, but it has higher adaptation to\r\nsoiling, because of the softness of the stems. When pastured reasonably\r\nclose, cropping would probably be preferable, as there would then be\r\nless waste from the treading of the plants. Nevertheless, in Egypt\r\nconsiderable quantities of the hay are stored for feeding in the summer\r\nmonths when green fodder is scarce.\r\n\r\nEgyptian clover is sometimes made into hay, but it is not essentially a\r\nhay plant. Much care is necessary when it is being cured to prevent loss\r\nin the leaves, and when cured the stems are so brittle that it is\r\ndifficult to prevent waste in handling the hay. It is pre-eminently a\r\nsoiling crop, and the greater portion is fed in the green form. From 4\r\ncuttings of the Muscowi variety as much as 25 to 30 tons of green\r\nfodder are harvested, and about 10 tons are produced by 2 cuttings of\r\nthe Saida variety.\r\n\r\nEgyptian clover has not been grown sufficiently long in this country to\r\njustify giving information based upon American experience that could be\r\ntaken as authoritative, with reference to the best methods of harvesting\r\nthe seed crop. There would seem to be no reasons, however, to suppose\r\nthat the methods followed in harvesting alfalfa could not be followed\r\nwith equal advantage in harvesting Egyptian clover. Nor can anything be\r\nsaid as yet with reference to which cutting of the series will furnish\r\nthe best seed crop.\r\n\r\nThe best service, probably, which this crop can render to the United\r\nStates is the enrichment of the soils on which the plants are grown. As\r\nthe same bacteria which inoculate alfalfa soils will not answer for\r\nEgyptian clover, and as the requisite bacteria may not be found in soils\r\nwhere it is desirable to grow this clover, the conclusion that it will\r\nnot grow sufficiently well in certain soils on which it is being tried\r\nshould not be reached until the question relating to the presence or\r\nabsence of the proper bacteria has been settled. If necessary to\r\nintroduce bacteria from Egypt, the obstacles in the way of such\r\nintroduction would not be at all serious, if undertaken by the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW CLOVER\r\n\r\nYellow clover (_Medicago lupulina_) is to be carefully distinguished\r\nfrom Hop clover (_Medicago procumbens_), which it resembles so closely\r\nin the form of the leaves and the color of the bloom as to have given\r\nrise in some instances to the interchangeable use of the names. The\r\nlatter is so named from the resemblance of the withered head when ripe\r\nto a bunch of hops. Its growth has been almost entirely superseded by\r\n_Medicago lupulina_, since the other variety was low in production and\r\nalso in nutrition. _Medicago lupulina_ is also called Black Medick,\r\nNonesuch, Black Nonesuch and Hop Trefoil. In both England and Germany it\r\nis now more commonly grown than white clover. It is more or less\r\nrecumbent in its habit of growth, but the stems do not root as do the\r\nrunners in the small white variety. The stems, though tender in the\r\nearly spring, become woody as the season advances. The flowers, as the\r\nname would indicate, are yellow, and the plants produce seed numerously.\r\nThe roots, like those of the small white variety, are more fibrous than\r\nin some of the larger varieties.\r\n\r\nYellow clover is perennial. Owing to the power which the plants have to\r\nmultiply through rooting and re-seeding, they can stay indefinitely in\r\ncongenial soils. The growth is vigorous in the early part of the season,\r\nbut less so later, and with the advance of the season the herbage\r\nproduced becomes more woody in character.\r\n\r\nThis plant furnishes considerable pasture during the spring months, but\r\nin the summer and autumn it makes but little growth. Though palatable\r\nearly in the season, it is less so later. Nevertheless, it may be made\r\nto add materially to the produce of pastures in which it grows. It also\r\naids in fertilizing the soil, though probably not quite to the same\r\nextent as white clover.\r\n\r\nYellow clover is indigenous to Europe. It is grown to a considerable\r\nextent in pastures in certain areas in Great Britain, France, Germany\r\nand other countries. It has highest adaptation for climates that are\r\nmoist and temperate. Although this plant is not extensively grown in the\r\nUnited States, it would seem probable that it will grow at least\r\nreasonably well in a majority of the States. The exceptions will be\r\nthose lacking in moisture in the absence of irrigation. It will grow\r\nbest in those that more properly lie within the clover belt; that is, in\r\nthose that lie northward. It grows with much vigor in Oregon and\r\nWashington west of the Cascade Mountains. In Canada, yellow clover will\r\ngrow with much vigor in all areas susceptible of cultivation, unless on\r\ncertain of the western prairies.\r\n\r\nYellow clover has highest adaptation for calcareous soils. In certain\r\nparts of England it has grown so vigorously on soils rich in lime as\r\nalmost to assume the character of a troublesome weed. It will grow well\r\non all clay loam soils, and reasonably well on stiff clays, the climatic\r\nconditions being suitable. It has greater power to grow on dry soils\r\nthan the small white variety.\r\n\r\nSince yellow clover is usually grown as an adjunct to permanent\r\npastures, it can scarcely be called a rotation plant. But, like other\r\nclovers, it enriches the soil, and, therefore, should be followed by\r\ncrops that are specially benefited by such enrichment, as, for\r\ninstance, the small cereal grains.\r\n\r\nYellow clover when sown is usually sown with other grass mixtures, and\r\nalong with grain as a nurse crop; hence, that preparation of the soil\r\nsuitable for the nurse crop will also be found suitable for the clover.\r\nIt is, moreover, a hardy plant, insomuch that in some instances, if the\r\nseed is scattered over unplowed surfaces, as those of pastures, in the\r\nearly spring, a sufficient number of plants will be obtained to\r\neventually establish the clover through self-seeding.\r\n\r\nThe seed is usually sown in the early spring, but in mild latitudes it\r\nmay also be sown in the early autumn. It may be sown by the same methods\r\nas other clovers. (See page 267.) It is usually sown to provide pasture,\r\nthe seed being mixed with that of other pasture plants before being\r\nsown. As the plants, like those of the small white variety, have much\r\npower to increase rather than decrease in pastures, it is not necessary\r\nto sow large quantities of seed, not more usually than 1 pound to the\r\nacre. But should the crops be wanted for seed, then not fewer than 3 to\r\n5 pounds per acre should be sown and without admixture with other\r\ngrasses or clovers. When the plants once obtain a footing on congenial\r\nsoils, there is usually enough of seed in the soil to make a sufficient\r\nstand of the plants in pastures without sowing any seed, but since the\r\nseed is usually relatively cheap, where an insufficient supply in the\r\nsoil is suspected, more or less seed should be sown.\r\n\r\nSince the stems of yellow clover plants become tough as the season of\r\ngrowth becomes considerably advanced, where it forms a considerable\r\nproportion of the pasture the aim should be to graze most heavily during\r\nthe early part of the season. The plants do not make much growth during\r\nthe autumn. It would probably be correct to say that it can grow under\r\nconditions more dry than are suitable for white clover, and,\r\nconsequently, it is more uniformly prominent in evidence in permanent\r\npastures when it has become established.\r\n\r\nYellow clover is not a really good hay plant, owing to its lack of\r\nbulkiness. But in some soils its presence may add considerably to the\r\nweight of a crop of hay, of which it is a factor.\r\n\r\nThis plant produces seed freely. The seeds are dark in color and weigh\r\n60 pounds to the bushel. The seed matures early, usually in June or\r\nJuly, according to locality. The methods of harvesting, threshing and\r\npreparing the seed for market are substantially the same as those\r\nadapted in handling small white clover. (See page 272.)\r\n\r\nWhile yellow clover is not the equal of the small white clover in\r\nadaptation to our conditions, it would seem that there are no reasons\r\nwhy it should not be sown to a greater extent than it is sown under\r\nAmerican conditions. A plant that is so hardy, that provides a\r\nconsiderable quantity of reasonably good pasture, that stores nitrogen\r\nin the soil, and that, moreover, does not stay in the soil to the extent\r\nof injuring crops that follow the breaking up of the pastures, should\r\ncertainly be encouraged to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAND LUCERNE\r\n\r\nSand Lucerne (_Medicago media_), sometimes designated _Medicago\r\nfalcata_, is probably simply a variety of the common alfalfa (_Medicago\r\nsativa_). Some botanists, however, look upon these as two distinct\r\nspecies. Others believe that _Medicago sativa_, with blossoms ranging\r\nfrom blue to violet purple, and _Medicago falcata_, with yellow\r\nblossoms, are two distinct species, while _Medicago media_, with\r\nblossoms ranging from bluish and purple to lemon yellow, is a hybrid\r\nbetween these. The name Sand Lucerne has doubtless been given to this\r\nplant because of the power which it has to grow in sandy soils.\r\n\r\nSand lucerne is so nearly like common alfalfa in appearance and habits\r\nof growth, that until the blossoming season, careless observers cannot\r\ndistinguish between the plants. (See page 114.) Sand lucerne, however,\r\nhas a more spreading habit of growth than common alfalfa, the seed-pods\r\nare less coiled and the seeds are lighter. The root system is strong and\r\nthe roots are probably more branched than those of ordinary alfalfa.\r\nUnder Michigan experience, given in Bulletin No. 198 of the Michigan\r\nExperiment Station, it has shown considerably higher adaptation to\r\nlight, sandy and gravelly soils than the former. The feeding properties\r\nof sand lucerne would not seem to be far different from those of common\r\nalfalfa (see page 119), but it is claimed that the former is\r\nconsiderably less liable to produce bloat in cattle and sheep than the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nSand lucerne is probably native to Europe and Asia. Some attention is\r\ngiven to growing it in Germany, the principal source from which comes\r\nsupplies of seed at the present time. It was introduced into Michigan by\r\nthe experiment station of that State in 1897, and its behavior in\r\nseveral trials made to grow it on sandy and gravelly soils in various\r\nplaces, has, on the whole, been encouraging.\r\n\r\nSince this variety, like the Turkestan, being considerably hardier than\r\ncommon alfalfa, can undoubtedly be grown further north than the latter,\r\nthere would seem to be no reasons at the same time why sand lucerne\r\nwould not grow satisfactorily on sandy soils that lie far south, but\r\nthis does not seem as yet to have been proved by actual demonstration.\r\nIt is possible, therefore, that this plant may render considerable\r\nservice to areas scattered over considerable portions of the United\r\nStates and Canada, in which the soil is light.\r\n\r\nWhile sand lucerne has higher adaptation than common alfalfa for sandy\r\nand gravelly soils, it does not follow that it has equal adaptation for\r\nbeing grown on ordinary alfalfa soils. No advantage, however, would\r\nresult from growing sand lucerne where common alfalfa will grow equally\r\nwell, as it is not superior to the latter as a food, if, indeed, it is\r\nequal to the same, and there would be a distinct disadvantage in the\r\ngreater cost of the seed of sand lucerne.\r\n\r\nSand lucerne is not any more a rotation plant than the common variety.\r\nIn fact, it is even less so, since it would not be practicable to\r\nintroduce it into short rotations when grown in northerly latitudes, as\r\nit does not reach a maximum growth for several years after the seed has\r\nbeen sown. But in mild latitudes, it may be found practicable to\r\nintroduce it into short rotations, like other alfalfa (see page 135),\r\nand on land that is too sandy to grow the common variety in the best\r\nform.\r\n\r\nMuch of what has been said about the preparation of the soil for common\r\nalfalfa will equally apply to the preparation of the same for sand\r\nlucerne. (See page 137.) But when the latter is sown on sandy or\r\ngravelly land, a moist condition of the seed-bed at the time of sowing\r\nis even more important than when sowing common alfalfa under ordinary\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe same methods of sowing the seed will be in order as are suitable for\r\nsowing common alfalfa in any particular locality. (See page 147.) This\r\nwill mean that in Northern areas sand lucerne can best be sown in the\r\nspring and as early as the danger from frost is over, that the plants\r\nmay get as much benefit as possible from the moisture in the soil before\r\ndry weather begins. It will also mean that if sown southward in the\r\nautumn, it may in some instances be necessary to wait longer for the\r\nsandy soils on which the seed is sown to become sufficiently moist to\r\nsprout the seed than for such a condition in soils on which common\r\nalfalfa is usually sown. The amounts of seed to sow will also be\r\npractically the same. (See page 152.)\r\n\r\nThe adaptation of sand lucerne for providing pasture is as high, if not,\r\nindeed, higher, than that of common alfalfa, since it is said that it\r\nhas less tendency to produce bloat in cattle and sheep, and it is not\r\nso easily destroyed, at least in Northern areas, by grazing. In\r\nproviding pasture, its higher adaptation is in furnishing the same for\r\ncattle, swine and horses.\r\n\r\nWith ample moisture, even as far north as Lansing, Michigan, three crops\r\nof hay may ordinarily be looked for. At the Michigan Experiment Station,\r\nsand lucerne sown in 1897 yielded cured: In 1898, at the rate of 6800\r\npounds per acre; in 1899, 10,580 pounds; in 1900, 12,310 pounds; and in\r\n1901, 13,839 pounds. The methods of cutting and curing are the same as\r\nfor other varieties of alfalfa. (See page 170.) The quality of the hay\r\nis not far different from that of common alfalfa. If there is a\r\ndifference, it would, perhaps, be a little against the sand lucerne,\r\nowing to the nature of the land producing it. For soiling food, it may\r\nbe handled in the same way as common alfalfa. (See page 166.)\r\n\r\nNo further information would seem to be available with reference to the\r\nproduction of seed in the United States than the statement that the\r\nefforts to grow it in Michigan had not been altogether successful. The\r\nquestion thus raised has an important bearing on the future growth of\r\nthe plant, as, if seed is to be imported from Europe when sand lucerne\r\nis to be sown, the expense of securing seed is likely to militate\r\nagainst extending its growth. It is probable, however, that this\r\ndifficulty will be overcome through the more perfect acclimation of the\r\nplants in the North, or by growing seed from the same in Western areas\r\nwhich have shown higher adaptation to the production of alfalfa seed.\r\n\r\nThe value of sand lucerne in fertilizing sandy and gravelly soils in\r\nthis country may yet be very considerable. Its value in putting humus\r\ninto the same may prove equally high. This value will arise chiefly from\r\nits greater ability to grow on such soils than various other legumes.\r\nWhen sown primarily for such a use, heavy seeding would seem to be\r\npreferable to ordinary seeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE CLOVER\r\n\r\nThe United States Department of Agriculture has quite recently\r\nintroduced a variety of clover known botanically as _Lespedeza bicolor_.\r\nIn 1902 small lots of seed were distributed to ascertain the value of\r\nthe plant grown under American conditions. Sufficient time has not yet\r\nelapsed to prove its value, but the indications encourage the belief\r\nthat it will be of some agricultural value under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nThis variety of clover is more erect and less branched in its habit of\r\ngrowth than the Japanese variety _Lespedeza striata_. Under Michigan\r\nconditions it was found to grow to the height of 3 feet on sandy soil\r\nand to about half that height on clay soil, the seed having been sown\r\nabout the middle of May. The stalks are about the same in structure as\r\nthose of alfalfa, and like alfalfa they do not lodge readily. The leaves\r\nare ovate in form and of a pea-green tint. The seed is formed in pods\r\nresembling those of lentils, only smaller. The seeds are larger than\r\nthose of crimson clover and are oblong in shape. In color they are\r\nmottled brown, yellow and green. The roots in the Michigan test produced\r\nnodules freely and without inoculating the soil by any artificial means.\r\nThe plants in the same tests were killed to the ground by early October\r\nfrosts.\r\n\r\nThis variety, like that grown so freely in the Southern States, is an\r\nannual. In the absence of experience in growing it under varied\r\nconditions, it would be premature to dwell upon its value. If it should\r\ngrow readily on sandy land, as the Michigan test would seem to indicate,\r\nit would render substantial service in fertilizing such soils. In the\r\ngrass garden of the Department of Agriculture at Washington, D. C., its\r\nbehavior has been such as to encourage making further tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORIDA CLOVER\r\n\r\nFlorida clover (_Desmodium tortuosum_) is sometimes grown both for hay\r\nand pasture, more especially in the Gulf States. It has been designated\r\nbotanically _Desmodium molle_, and is also known by the common names\r\nBeggar Weed, Giant Beggar Weed, Beggar Ticks and Tickweed. The name\r\nFlorida Clover has been given to it because of its prevalence on the\r\nlight soils of Florida. The name \"beggar\" has probably been applied to\r\nthis plant because of its relation to poverty in soils, in which it is\r\nmore commonly grown, and the name \"ticks\" from the clinging habit of the\r\nseed-pods to surfaces with which they come in contact.\r\n\r\nBeggar Weed is an erect and branching plant, which grows from 2 to 10\r\nfeet high. The branches are woody in character, especially in the lower\r\nparts, which prevents close cropping by animals grazing on the plants.\r\nThe trifoliate leaves are numerous, especially on the upper portions.\r\nThe panicle is erect and is considerably branched. The pods are prickly\r\nand have many joints. These break asunder when matured, and are\r\nfrequently distributed by adhering to the covering of animals and the\r\nclothing of men. The strong, spreading roots have much power to gather\r\nfood in the soil and also to enrich the same by means of the tubercles\r\nformed on the roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Beggar Weed or Florida Clover\r\n  (_Desmodium tortuosum_) (Flower and Seed Stems)\r\n  North Carolina Experiment Station]\r\n\r\nThis plant grows only in warm weather, and it is able to withstand much\r\ndrought. Its value for pasture and hay would seem to depend considerably\r\non the stage of growth at which it is grazed or harvested for hay. When\r\nnearing maturity, stock do not relish it much, either as pasture or hay.\r\nIt is frequently classed as a weed, but in certain poor soils it has\r\nbeen deemed worthy of cultivation.\r\n\r\nBeggar weed is native to the West India Islands and also, it is thought,\r\nto Southern Florida. In 1879 seeds were distributed by the Department of\r\nAgriculture. It is now grown more or less in the wild or cultivated form\r\nin all the Gulf States. While it may be successfully grown as far north\r\nas the Ohio River, it is not probable that it will be sown far north of\r\nany of the Gulf States, since other fodder plants more valuable in\r\nproducing food can be grown to supply the wants of live stock. At the\r\nMinnesota University Experiment Farm, the author sowed seed in May.\r\nThe plants came into bloom in September, but did not mature any seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Beggar Weed\r\n  (_Desmodium tortuosum_) (Root System)\r\n  North Carolina Experiment Station]\r\n\r\nBeggar weed will grow on almost any kind of soil reasonably free from an\r\nexcess of ground moisture. Its power to grow on poor and light soils,\r\neven light enough to lift with the wind, is very considerable. Its\r\nhighest use will probably be found on soils so light and sterile that\r\nbetter forms of useful vegetation are not easily grown on them.\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be called a rotation plant, since it more commonly grows\r\nin the wild form, and on lands so poor as to be considered unprofitable\r\nfor regular cropping. But when cultivated, it should be followed by some\r\ncrop that can make a good use of the nitrogen left in the soil in the\r\ntubercles formed on the roots of the beggar weed plants.\r\n\r\nThe soil does not, as a rule, require deep stirring when preparing it\r\nfor beggar weed. This fact finds demonstration in the ability of the\r\nplants to re-seed the ground when grown for grazing.\r\n\r\nThe seed is usually sown in the Gulf States late in March or early in\r\nApril. It germinates slowly, and the plants make the most vigorous\r\ngrowth after the weather becomes warm. The seed is more commonly\r\nscattered broadcast, but may be drilled in, and at distances that will\r\nor will not admit of cultivation as may be desired. Thick seeding is\r\npreferable to prevent coarseness and woodiness in the growth of the\r\nplants. Not less than 10 pounds of hulled seed per acre should be sown\r\nin the broadcast form when sown for hay. When sown in drills, less seed\r\nis required, but usually the seed is sown broadcast. In the hulled form,\r\nin which the seed is more commonly sold, according to Professor H. H.\r\nHume, the measured bushel weighs 60 to 64 pounds, and with the hulls on,\r\nfrom 10 to 40 pounds, the average weight, as purchased by dealers, being\r\nabout 20 pounds. The cleaned seed bears considerable resemblance to\r\nclover seed.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of farm stock, as cattle, horses, mules, sheep and even swine,\r\nare said to do well when grazing on beggar-weed pastures in the summer\r\nand autumn. They do not usually graze it closely after it has been well\r\nstarted, owing to the woody character of the stems. When thus cropped\r\nback, it starts out afresh, and thus continues to produce grazing until\r\nthe arrival of frost. It is said that the pasture is of but little value\r\nin winter. One strong point, however, in favor of such pastures, is the\r\nability of the plants to re-seed the land when not grazed too closely,\r\nand thus to perpetuate the grazing from year to year.\r\n\r\nNo little diversity of opinion exists as to the value of this plant for\r\nproducing hay. Some growers speak highly of its palatability and\r\nnutrition. Others speak of it as being of very little value as a hay\r\nplant. This difference in opinion is doubtless due largely to cutting\r\nthe crop at different stages of growth. If allowed to become too\r\nadvanced before it is cut, the woody character of the hay would\r\ndoubtless make it unpalatable, whereas, if cut early, at least as early\r\nas the showing of the first blooms, if not, indeed, earlier, it would be\r\neaten with a much greater relish. The yields of hay are said to usually\r\nexceed 2 tons per acre.\r\n\r\nThe seed matures in September and October. The methods of saving the\r\nseed have usually been of a somewhat primitive character, as by hand\r\nwhen saved in small quantities. But there would seem to be no reason why\r\nthe seed crop could not be harvested by the binder.\r\n\r\nWhere alfalfa or cow peas can be successfully grown, either crop would\r\nbe preferable. But on some soils these are not a success, especially\r\nwhen the first attempts are made to grow crops. The choice of hay may be\r\none between a crop of beggar weed and no crop at all. All are agreed as\r\nto the renovation which it brings to soils; hence, when grown or allowed\r\nto grow on unproductive soil for a few years and then plowed under, the\r\nsoil becomes productive. Since it grows late rather than early in the\r\nseason where the seed is in the land, it will not interfere with the\r\ngrowth of the corn, but will come on later, and thus exert a beneficial\r\ninfluence on the soil. But the fact should not be overlooked that beggar\r\nweed once in the land has considerable power to stay there. In other\r\nwords, like sweet clover, it has some of the characteristics of a weed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUFFALO CLOVER\r\n\r\nBuffalo clover (_Trifolium stoloniferum_) is a native species procumbent\r\nin its habit of growth. The leaves are most abundant at the base of the\r\nplants. The flower heads, about an inch in diameter, are rose colored,\r\nand rise to the height of about one foot from the ground.\r\n\r\nThis variety, said to be perennial in its habit of growth, is probably\r\nthe same as _Trifolium reflexum_, said to be biennial in Kansas. Plants\r\nare found growing wild in prairies, between forests, and in open\r\nwoodlands, from Kentucky on the east, to Kansas on the west. It is\r\nthought that this clover would repay cultivation, but the author has not\r\nbeen able to get any information bearing upon its behavior under\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASIDE CLOVER\r\n\r\nSeaside clover (_Trifolium invulneratum_) has rendered some service to\r\nagriculture in what is known as the \"Great Basin,\" which includes parts\r\nof Oregon and Nevada. In Bulletin No. 15, Bureau of Plant Industry,\r\nissued by the United States Department of Agriculture, it is referred to\r\nas one of the most promising species for cultivation in that area. Under\r\nthe influence of irrigation it has spread, in one instance cited, into\r\nsage brush soil, and there, along with timothy and red top, has aided in\r\nproducing fine crops. In, low, swampy, non-alkaline areas, it often\r\nyields from 1/2 to 1-1/4 tons of hay per acre. It has been estimated\r\nthat with correct conditions it would be found about equal in producing\r\npower and feeding value to alsike clover. It is at least questionable,\r\nhowever, if it is likely to supersede to any considerable degree the\r\nvarieties already under general cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n  Alfalfa\r\n

It is the first book\r\nwhich has systematized the subject of animal breeding. The leading laws\r\nwhich govern this most intricate question the author has boldly defined\r\nand authoritatively arranged. The chapters which he has written on the\r\nmore involved features of the subject, as sex and the relative influence\r\nof parents, should go far toward setting at rest the wildly speculative\r\nviews cherished with reference to these questions. The striking\r\noriginality in the treatment of the subject is no less conspicuous than\r\nthe superb order and regular sequence of thought from the beginning to\r\nthe end of the book.
