Tilling\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cover and Title Page: Lava fountains and flows, Mauna\r\nLoa, Hawaii, July 6, 1975.]\r\n\r\nVolcanoes destroy and volcanoes create. The catastrophic eruption of\r\nMount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, made clear the awesome destructive\r\npower of a volcano. Yet, over a time span longer than human memory and\r\nrecord, volcanoes have played a key role in forming and modifying the\r\nplanet upon which we live. More than 80 percent of the Earth’s\r\nsurface—above and below sea level—is of volcanic origin. Gaseous\r\nemissions from volcanic vents over hundreds of millions of years formed\r\nthe Earth’s earliest oceans and atmosphere, which supplied the\r\ningredients vital to evolve and sustain life. Over geologic eons,\r\ncountless volcanic eruptions have produced mountains, plateaus, and\r\nplains, which subsequent erosion and weathering have sculpted into\r\nmajestic landscapes and formed fertile soils.\r\n\r\nIronically, these volcanic soils and inviting terranes have attracted,\r\nand continue to attract, people to live on the flanks of volcanoes.\r\nThus, as population density increases in regions of active or\r\npotentially active volcanoes, mankind must become increasingly aware of\r\nthe hazards and learn not to “crowd” the volcanoes. People living in the\r\nshadow of volcanoes must live in harmony with them and expect, and\r\nshould plan for, periodic violent unleashings of their pent-up energy.\r\n\r\nThis booklet presents a generalized summary of the nature, workings,\r\nproducts, and hazards of the common types of volcanoes around the world,\r\nalong with a brief introduction to the techniques of volcano monitoring\r\nand research.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nOn August 24, A.D. 79, Vesuvius Volcano suddenly exploded and destroyed\r\nthe Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Although Vesuvius had shown\r\nstirrings of life when a succession of earthquakes in A.D. 63 caused\r\nsome damage, it had been literally quiet for hundreds of years and was\r\nconsidered “extinct.” Its surface and crater were green and covered with\r\nvegetation, so the eruption was totally unexpected. Yet in a few hours,\r\nhot volcanic ash and dust buried the two cities so thoroughly that their\r\nruins were not uncovered for nearly 1,700 years, when the discovery of\r\nan outer wall in 1748 started a period of modern archeology. Vesuvius\r\nhas continued its activity intermittently ever since A.D. 79 with\r\nnumerous minor eruptions and several major eruptions occurring in 1631,\r\n1794, 1872, 1906 and in 1944 in the midst of the Italian campaign of\r\nWorld War II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nIn the United States on March 27, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano in the\r\nCascade Range, southwestern Washington, reawakened after more than a\r\ncentury of dormancy and provided a dramatic and tragic reminder that\r\nthere are active volcanoes in the “lower 48” States as well as in Hawaii\r\nand Alaska. The catastrophic eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18,\r\n1980, and related mudflows and flooding caused significant loss of life\r\n(57 dead or missing) and property damage (over $1.2 billion). Mount St.\r\nHelens is expected to remain intermittently active for months or years,\r\npossibly even decades.\r\n\r\nThe word “volcano” comes from the little island of Vulcano in the\r\nMediterranean Sea off Sicily. Centuries ago, the people living in this\r\narea believed that Vulcano was the chimney of the forge of Vulcan—the\r\nblacksmith of the Roman gods. They thought that the hot lava fragments\r\nand clouds of dust erupting from Vulcano came from Vulcan’s forge as he\r\nbeat out thunderbolts for Jupiter, king of the gods, and weapons for\r\nMars, the god of war. In Polynesia the people attributed eruptive\r\nactivity to the beautiful but wrathful Pele, Goddess of Volcanoes,\r\nwhenever she was angry or spiteful. Today we know that volcanic\r\neruptions are not supernatural but can be studied and interpreted by\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Nature of Volcanoes\r\n\r\n\r\nVolcanoes are mountains, but they are very different from other\r\nmountains; they are not formed by folding and crumpling or by uplift and\r\nerosion. Instead, volcanoes are built by the accumulation of their own\r\neruptive products—lava, bombs (crusted over lava blobs), ashflows, and\r\ntephra (airborne ash and dust). A volcano is most commonly a conical\r\nhill or mountain built around a vent that connects with reservoirs of\r\nmolten rock below the surface of the Earth. The term volcano also refers\r\nto the opening or vent through which the molten rock and associated\r\ngases are expelled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fountaining lava and volcanic debris during the 1959\r\nKilauea Iki eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii.]\r\n\r\nDriven by buoyancy and gas pressure the molten rock, which is lighter\r\nthan the surrounding solid rock, forces its way upward and may\r\nultimately break through zones of weaknesses in the Earth’s crust. If\r\nso, an eruption begins, and the molten rock may pour from the vent as\r\nnon-explosive lava flows, or it may shoot violently into the air as\r\ndense clouds of lava fragments. Larger fragments fall back around the\r\nvent, and accumulations of fall-back fragments may move downslope as ash\r\nflows under the force of gravity. Some of the finer ejected materials\r\nmay be carried by the wind only to fall to the ground many miles away.\r\nThe finest ash particles may be injected miles into the atmosphere and\r\ncarried many times around the world by stratospheric winds before\r\nsettling out.\r\n\r\nMolten rock below the surface of the Earth that rises in volcanic vents\r\nis known as _magma_, but after it erupts from a volcano it is called\r\n_lava_. Originating many tens of miles beneath the ground, the ascending\r\nmagma commonly contains some crystals, fragments of surrounding\r\n(unmelted) rocks, and dissolved gases, but it is primarily a liquid\r\ncomposed principally of oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, magnesium,\r\ncalcium, sodium, potassium, titanium, and manganese. Magmas also contain\r\nmany other chemical elements in trace quantities. Upon cooling, the\r\nliquid magma may precipitate crystals of various minerals until\r\nsolidification is complete to form an _igneous_ or _magmatic rock_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An idealized diagram of a volcano in an oceanic\r\nenvironment (left) and in a continental environment (right).]\r\n\r\nThe diagram below shows that heat concentrated in the Earth’s upper\r\n_mantle_ raises temperatures sufficiently to melt the rock locally by\r\nfusing the materials with the lowest melting temperatures, resulting in\r\nsmall, isolated blobs of magma. These blobs then collect, rise through\r\nconduits and fractures, and some ultimately may re-collect in larger\r\npockets or reservoirs (“holding tanks”) a few miles beneath the Earth’s\r\nsurface. Mounting pressure within the reservoir may drive the magma\r\nfurther upward through structurally weak zones to erupt as lava at the\r\nsurface. In a continental environment, magmas are generated in the\r\nEarth’s crust as well as at varying depths in the upper mantle. The\r\nvariety of molten rocks in the crust, plus the possibility of mixing\r\nwith molten materials from the underlying mantle, leads to the\r\nproduction of magmas with widely different chemical compositions.\r\n\r\nIf magmas cool rapidly, as might be expected near or on the Earth’s\r\nsurface, they solidify to form igneous rocks that are finely crystalline\r\nor glassy with few crystals. Accordingly, lavas, which of course are\r\nvery rapidly cooled, form volcanic rocks typically characterized by a\r\nsmall percentage of crystals or fragments set in a matrix of _glass_\r\n(quenched or super-cooled magma) or finer grained crystalline materials.\r\nIf magmas never breach the surface to erupt and remain deep underground,\r\nthey cool much more slowly and thus allow ample time to sustain crystal\r\nprecipitation and growth, resulting in the formation of coarser grained,\r\nnearly completely crystalline, igneous rocks. Subsequent to final\r\ncrystallization and solidification, such rocks can be exhumed by erosion\r\nmany thousands or millions of years later and be exposed as large bodies\r\nof so-called _granitic_ rocks, as, for example, those spectacularly\r\ndisplayed in Yosemite National Park and other parts of the majestic\r\nSierra Nevada mountains of California.\r\n\r\nLava is red hot when it pours or blasts out of a vent but soon changes\r\nto dark red, gray, black, or some other color as it cools and\r\nsolidifies. Very hot, gas-rich lava containing abundant iron and\r\nmagnesium is fluid and flows like hot tar, whereas cooler, gas-poor lava\r\nhigh in silicon, sodium, and potassium flows sluggishly, like thick\r\nhoney in some cases or in others like pasty, blocky masses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two Polynesian terms are used to identify the surface\r\ncharacter of Hawaiian lava flows. Aa, a basalt with a rough, blocky\r\nappearance, much like furnace slag, is shown at the top. Pahoehoe, a\r\nmore fluid variety with a smooth, satiny and sometimes glassy\r\nappearance, is shown at the bottom.]\r\n\r\nAll magmas contain dissolved gases, and as they rise to the surface to\r\nerupt, the confining pressures are reduced and the dissolved gases are\r\nliberated either quietly or explosively. If the lava is a thin fluid\r\n(not viscous), the gases may escape easily. But if the lava is thick and\r\npasty (highly viscous), the gases will not move freely but will build up\r\ntremendous pressure, and ultimately escape with explosive violence.\r\nGases in lava may be compared with the gas in a bottle of a carbonated\r\nsoft drink. If you put your thumb over the top of the bottle and shake\r\nit vigorously, the gas separates from the drink and forms bubbles. When\r\nyou remove your thumb abruptly, there is a miniature explosion of gas\r\nand liquid. The gases in lava behave in somewhat the same way. Their\r\nsudden expansion causes the terrible explosions that throw out great\r\nmasses of solid rock as well as lava, dust, and ashes.\r\n\r\nThe violent separation of gas from lava may produce rock froth called\r\n_pumice_. Some of this froth is so light—because of the many gas\r\nbubbles—that it floats on water. In many eruptions, the froth is\r\nshattered explosively into small fragments that are hurled high into the\r\nair in the form of volcanic cinders (red or black), volcanic ash\r\n(commonly tan or gray), and volcanic dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: During the 1959 eruption of Kilauea Iki, fountaining lava\r\nand volcanic debris completely blocked several of the roads in the\r\nHawaii Volcanoes National Park.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Principal Types of Volcanoes\r\n\r\n\r\nGeologists generally group volcanoes into four main kinds—cinder cones,\r\ncomposite volcanoes, shield volcanoes, and lava domes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Cinder cones\r\n\r\nCinder cones are the simplest type of volcano. They are built from\r\nparticles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the\r\ngas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small\r\nfragments that solidify and fall as _cinders_ around the vent to form a\r\ncircular or oval cone. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped _crater_ at\r\nthe summit and rarely rise more than a thousand feet or so above their\r\nsurroundings. Cinder cones are numerous in western North America as well\r\nas throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Schematic representation of the internal structure of a\r\ntypical cinder cone.]\r\n\r\nIn 1943 a cinder cone started growing on a farm near the village of\r\nParícutin in Mexico. Explosive eruptions caused by gas rapidly expanding\r\nand escaping from molten lava formed cinders that fell back around the\r\nvent, building up the cone to a height of 1,200 feet. The last explosive\r\neruption left a funnel-shaped crater at the top of the cone. After the\r\nexcess gases had largely dissipated, the molten rock quietly poured out\r\non the surrounding surface of the cone and moved downslope as lava\r\nflows. This order of events—eruption, formation of cone and crater, lava\r\nflow—is a common sequence in the formation of cinder cones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parícutin Volcano, Mexico, is a cinder cone rising\r\napproximately 1,200 feet above the surrounding plain.]\r\n\r\nDuring 9 years of activity, Parícutin built a prominent cone, covered\r\nabout 100 square miles with ashes, and destroyed the town of San Juan.\r\nGeologists from many parts of the world studied Parícutin during its\r\nlifetime and learned a great deal about volcanism, its products, and the\r\nmodification of a volcanic landform by erosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Composite volcanoes\r\n\r\nSome of the Earth’s grandest mountains are _composite_\r\nvolcanoes—sometimes called _stratovolcanoes_. They are typically\r\nsteep-sided, symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating\r\nlayers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and bombs and may\r\nrise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases. Some of the most\r\nconspicuous and beautiful mountains in the world are composite\r\nvolcanoes, including Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Cotopaxi in Ecuador,\r\nMount Shasta in California, Mount Hood in Oregon, and Mount St. Helens\r\nand Mount Rainier in Washington.\r\n\r\nMost composite volcanoes have a crater at the summit which contains a\r\ncentral vent or a clustered group of vents. Lavas either flow through\r\nbreaks in the crater wall or issue from fissures on the flanks of the\r\ncone. Lava, solidified within the fissures, forms dikes that act as ribs\r\nwhich greatly strengthen the cone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Schematic representation of the internal structure of a\r\ntypical composite volcano.]\r\n\r\nThe essential feature of a composite volcano is a conduit system through\r\nwhich magma from a reservoir deep in the Earth’s crust rises to the\r\nsurface. The volcano is built up by the accumulation of material erupted\r\nthrough the conduit and increases in size as lava, cinders, ash, etc.,\r\nare added to its slopes.\r\n\r\nWhen a composite volcano becomes dormant, erosion begins to destroy the\r\ncone. As the cone is stripped away, the hardened magma filling the\r\nconduit (the volcanic plug) and fissures (the dikes) becomes exposed,\r\nand it too is slowly reduced by erosion. Finally, all that remains is\r\nthe plug and dike complex projecting above the land surface—a telltale\r\nremnant of the vanished volcano.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shishaldin Volcano, an imposing composite cone, towers\r\n9,372 feet above sea level in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting variation of a composite volcano can be seen at Crater\r\nLake in Oregon. From what geologists can interpret of its past, a high\r\nvolcano—called Mount Mazama—probably similar in appearance to\r\npresent-day Mount Rainier was once located at this spot. Following a\r\nseries of tremendous explosions about 6,800 years ago, the volcano lost\r\nits top. Enormous volumes of volcanic ash and dust were expelled and\r\nswept down the slopes as ash flows and avalanches. These large-volume\r\nexplosions rapidly drained the lava beneath the mountain and weakened\r\nthe upper part. The top then collapsed to form a large depression, which\r\nlater filled with water and is now completely occupied by beautiful\r\nCrater Lake. A last gasp of eruptions produced a small cinder cone,\r\nwhich rises above the water surface as Wizard Island near the rim of the\r\nlake. Depressions such as Crater Lake, formed by collapse of volcanoes,\r\nare known as _calderas_. They are usually large, steep-walled,\r\nbasin-shaped depressions formed by the collapse of a large area over,\r\nand around, a volcanic vent or vents. Calderas range in form and size\r\nfrom roughly circular depressions 1 to 15 miles in diameter to huge\r\nelongated depressions as much as 60 miles long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crater Lake, Oregon; Wizard Island, a cinder cone, rises\r\nabove the lake surface.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 The Evolution of a Composite Volcano:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: a. Magma, rising upward through a conduit, erupts at the\r\nEarth’s surface to form a volcanic cone. Lava flows spread over the\r\nsurrounding area.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: b. As volcanic activity continues, perhaps over spans of\r\nhundreds of years, the cone is built to a great height and lava flows\r\nform an extensive plateau around its base. During this period, streams\r\nenlarge and deepen their valleys.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: c. When volcanic activity ceases, erosion starts to\r\ndestroy the cone. After thousands of years, the great cone is stripped\r\naway to expose the hardened “volcanic plug” in the conduit. During this\r\nperiod of inactivity, streams broaden their valleys and dissect the lava\r\nplateau to form isolated lava-capped mesas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: d. Continued erosion removes all traces of the cone and\r\nthe land is worn down to a surface of low relief. All that remains is a\r\nprojecting plug or “volcanic neck,” a small lava-capped mesa, and\r\nvestiges of the once lofty volcano and its surrounding lava plateau.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Shield volcanoes\r\n\r\nShield volcanoes, the third type of volcano, are built almost entirely\r\nof fluid lava flows. Flow after flow pours out in all directions from a\r\ncentral _summit_ vent, or group of vents, building a broad, gently\r\nsloping cone of flat, domical shape, with a profile much like that of a\r\nwarrior’s shield. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands\r\nof highly fluid lava flows called basalt lava that spread widely over\r\ngreat distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. Lavas\r\nalso commonly erupt from vents along fractures (rift zones) that develop\r\non the flanks of the cone. Some of the largest volcanoes in the world\r\nare shield volcanoes. In northern California and Oregon, many shield\r\nvolcanoes have diameters of 3 or 4 miles and heights of 1,500 to 2,000\r\nfeet. The Hawaiian Islands are composed of linear chains of these\r\nvolcanoes including Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii—two of\r\nthe world’s most active volcanoes. The floor of the ocean is more than\r\n15,000 feet deep at the bases of the islands. As Mauna Loa, the largest\r\nof the shield volcanoes (and also the world’s largest active volcano),\r\nprojects 13,677 feet above sea level, its top is over 28,000 feet above\r\nthe deep ocean floor.\r\n\r\nIn some eruptions, basaltic lava pours out quietly from long fissures\r\ninstead of central vents and floods the surrounding countryside with\r\nlava flow upon lava flow, forming broad plateaus. Lava plateaus of this\r\ntype can be seen in Iceland, southeastern Washington, eastern Oregon,\r\nand southern Idaho. Along the Snake River in Idaho, and the Columbia\r\nRiver in Washington and Oregon, these lava flows are beautifully exposed\r\nand measure more than a mile in total thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawaii, a giant among the active\r\nvolcanoes of the world; snow-capped Mauna Kea Volcano in the distance.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The internal structure of a typical shield volcano.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Lava domes\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A sketch of the havoc wrought in St. Pierre Harbor on\r\nMartinique during the eruption of Mont Pelée in 1902.]\r\n\r\nVolcanic or lava domes are formed by relatively small, bulbous masses of\r\nlava too viscous to flow any great distance; consequently, on extrusion,\r\nthe lava piles over and around its vent. A dome grows largely by\r\nexpansion from within. As it grows its outer surface cools and hardens,\r\nthen shatters, spilling loose fragments down its sides. Some domes form\r\ncraggy knobs or spines over the volcanic vent, whereas others form\r\nshort, steep-sided lava flows known as “coulees.” Volcanic domes\r\ncommonly occur within the craters or on the flanks of large composite\r\nvolcanoes. The nearly circular Novarupta Dome that formed during the\r\n1912 eruption of Katmai Volcano, Alaska, measures 800 feet across and\r\n200 feet high. The internal structure of this dome—defined by layering\r\nof lava fanning upward and outward from the center—indicates that it\r\ngrew largely by expansion from within. Mont Pelée in Martinique, Lesser\r\nAntilles, and Lassen Peak and Mono domes in California are examples of\r\nlava domes. An extremely destructive eruption accompanied the growth of\r\na dome at Mont Pelée in 1902. The coastal town of St. Pierre, about 4\r\nmiles downslope to the south, was demolished and nearly 30,000\r\ninhabitants were killed by an incandescent, high-velocity ash flow and\r\nassociated hot gases and volcanic dust. Only two men survived; one\r\nbecause he was in a poorly ventilated, dungeon-like jail cell and the\r\nother who somehow made his way safely through the burning city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Novarupta Dome formed during the 1912 eruption of\r\nKatmai Volcano, Alaska.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Schematic representation of the internal structure of a\r\ntypical volcanic dome.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Other Volcanic Structures\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Plugs (necks)\r\n\r\nCongealed magma, along with fragmental volcanic and wallrock materials,\r\ncan be preserved in the feeding conduits of a volcano upon cessation of\r\nactivity. These preserved rocks form crudely cylindrical masses, from\r\nwhich project radiating dikes; they may be visualized as the fossil\r\nremains of the innards of a volcano (the so-called “volcanic plumbing\r\nsystem”) and are referred to as volcanic _plugs_ or _necks_. The igneous\r\nmaterial in a plug may have a range of composition similar to that of\r\nassociated lavas or ash, but may also include fragments and blocks of\r\ndenser, coarser grained rocks—higher in iron and magnesium, lower in\r\nsilicon—thought to be samples of the Earth’s deep crust or upper mantle\r\nplucked and transported by the ascending magma. Many plugs and necks are\r\nlargely or wholly composed of fragmental volcanic material and of\r\nfragments of wallrock, which can be of any type. Plugs that bear a\r\nparticularly strong imprint of explosive eruption of highly gas-charged\r\nmagma are called _diatremes_ or _tuff-breccia_.\r\n\r\nVolcanic plugs are believed to overlie a body of magma which could be\r\neither still largely liquid or completely solid depending on the state\r\nof activity of the volcano. Plugs are known, or postulated, to be\r\ncommonly funnel shaped and to taper downward into bodies increasingly\r\nelliptical in plan or elongated to dike-like forms. Typically, volcanic\r\nplugs and necks tend to be more resistant to erosion than their\r\nenclosing rock formations. Thus, after the volcano becomes inactive and\r\ndeeply eroded, the exhumed plug may stand up in bold relief as an\r\nirregular, columnar structure. One of the best known and most\r\nspectacular diatremes in the United States is Ship Rock in New Mexico,\r\nwhich towers some 1,700 feet above the more deeply eroded surrounding\r\nplain. Volcanic plugs, including diatremes, are found elsewhere in the\r\nwestern United States and also in Germany, South Africa, Tanzania, and\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ship Rock, San Juan County, New Mexico.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Maars\r\n\r\nAlso called “tuff cones,” _maars_ are shallow, flat-floored craters that\r\nscientists interpret have formed above diatremes as a result of a\r\nviolent expansion of magmatic gas or steam; deep erosion of a maar\r\npresumably would expose a diatreme. Maars range in size from 200 to\r\n6,500 feet across and from 30 to 650 feet deep, and most are commonly\r\nfilled with water to form natural lakes. Most maars have low rims\r\ncomposed of a mixture of loose fragments of volcanic rock and rocks torn\r\nfrom the walls of the diatreme.\r\n\r\nMaars occur in the western United States, in the Eifel region of\r\nGermany, and in other geologically young volcanic regions of the world.\r\nAn excellent example of a maar is Zuni Salt Lake in New Mexico, a\r\nshallow saline lake that occupies a flat-floored crater about 6,500 feet\r\nacross and 400 feet deep. Its low rim is composed of loose pieces of\r\nbasaltic lava and wallrocks (sandstone, shale, limestone) of the\r\nunderlying diatreme, as well as random chunks of ancient crystalline\r\nrocks blasted upward from great depths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Zuni Salt Lake Maar, Catron County, New Mexico.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Nonvolcanic craters\r\n\r\nSome well-exposed, nearly circular areas of intensely deformed\r\nsedimentary rocks, in which a central vent-like feature is surrounded by\r\na ring-shaped depression, resemble volcanic structures in gross form. As\r\nno clear evidence of volcanic origin could be found in or near these\r\nstructures, scientists initially described them as “cryptovolcanic,” a\r\nterm now rarely used. Recent studies have shown that not all craters are\r\nof volcanic origin. Impact craters, formed by collisions with the Earth\r\nof large meteorites, asteroids, or comets, share with volcanoes the\r\nimprints of violent origin, as evidenced by severe disruption, and even\r\nlocal melting, of rock. Fragments of meteorites or chemically detectable\r\ntraces of extraterrestrial materials and indications of strong forces\r\nacting from above, rather than from below, distinguish impact from\r\nvolcanic features.\r\n\r\nOther possible explanations for these nonvolcanic craters include\r\nsubsurface salt-dome intrusion (and subsequent dissolution and\r\ncollapse); collapse caused by subsurface limestone dissolution and/or\r\nground-water withdrawal; and collapse related to melting of glacial ice.\r\nAn impressive example of an impact structure is Meteor Crater, Ariz.,\r\nwhich is visited by thousands of tourists each year. This impact crater,\r\n4,000 feet in diameter and 600 feet deep, was formed in the geologic\r\npast (probably 30,000-50,000 years before present) by a meteorite\r\nstriking the Earth at a speed of many thousands of miles per hour.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Meteor Crater, very fresh, morphologically distinct,\r\nimpact craters are found at three sites near Odessa, Tex., as well as 10\r\nor 12 other locations in the world. Of the more deeply eroded, less\r\nobvious, postulated impact structures, there are about ten\r\nwell-established sites in the United States and perhaps 80 or 90\r\nelsewhere in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Meteor Crater, Arizona.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount St. Helens, about noon, May 18, 1980.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Types of Volcanic Eruptions\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring an episode of activity, a volcano commonly displays a distinctive\r\npattern of behavior. Some mild eruptions merely discharge steam and\r\nother gases, whereas other eruptions quietly extrude quantities of lava.\r\nThe most spectacular eruptions consist of violent explosions that blast\r\ngreat clouds of gas-laden debris into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe type of volcanic eruption is often labeled with the name of a\r\nwell-known volcano where characteristic behavior is similar—hence the\r\nuse of such terms as “Strombolian,” “Vulcanian,” “Vesuvian,” “Peléan,”\r\n“Hawaiian,” and others. Some volcanoes may exhibit only one\r\ncharacteristic type of eruption during an interval of activity—others\r\nmay display an entire sequence of types.\r\n\r\nIn a Strombolian-type eruption observed during the 1965 activity of\r\nIrazú Volcano in Costa Rica, huge clots of molten lava burst from the\r\nsummit crater to form luminous arcs through the sky. Collecting on the\r\nflanks of the cone, lava clots combined to stream down the slopes in\r\nfiery rivulets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Irazú Volcano, Costa Rica, 1965.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the eruptive activity of Parícutin Volcano in 1947\r\ndemonstrated a “Vulcanian”-type eruption, in which a dense cloud of\r\nash-laden gas explodes from the crater and rises high above the peak.\r\nSteaming ash forms a whitish cloud near the upper level of the cone.\r\n\r\nIn a “Vesuvian” eruption, as typified by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius\r\nin Italy in A.D. 79, great quantities of ash-laden gas are violently\r\ndischarged to form a cauliflower-shaped cloud high above the volcano.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parícutin Volcano, Mexico, 1947.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount Vesuvius Volcano, Italy, 1944.]\r\n\r\nIn a “Peléan” or “Nuée Ardente” (glowing cloud) eruption, such as\r\noccurred on the Mayon Volcano in the Philippines in 1968, a large\r\nquantity of gas, dust, ash, and incandescent lava fragments are blown\r\nout of a central crater, fall back, and form tongue-like, glowing\r\navalanches that move downslope at velocities as great as 100 miles per\r\nhour. Such eruptive activity can cause great destruction and loss of\r\nlife if it occurs in populated areas, as demonstrated by the devastation\r\nof St. Pierre during the 1902 eruption of Mont Pelée on Martinique,\r\nLesser Antilles.\r\n\r\n“Hawaiian” eruptions may occur along fissures or fractures that serve as\r\nlinear vents, such as during the eruption of Mauna Loa Volcano in Hawaii\r\nin 1950; or they may occur at a central vent such as during the 1959\r\neruption in Kilauea Iki Crater of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii. In\r\nfissure-type eruptions, molten, incandescent lava spurts from a fissure\r\non the volcano’s rift zone and feeds lava streams that flow downslope.\r\nIn central-vent eruptions, a fountain of fiery lava spurts to a height\r\nof several hundred feet or more. Such lava may collect in old pit\r\ncraters to form lava lakes, or form cones, or feed radiating flows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawaii, 1950.]\r\n\r\n“Phreatic” (or steam-blast) eruptions are driven by explosive expanding\r\nsteam resulting from cold ground or surface water coming into contact\r\nwith hot rock or magma. The distinguishing feature of phreatic\r\nexplosions is that they only blast out fragments of preexisting solid\r\nrock from the volcanic conduit; no new magma is erupted. Phreatic\r\nactivity is generally weak, but can be quite violent in some cases, such\r\nas the 1965 eruption of Taal Volcano, Philippines, and the 1975-76\r\nactivity at La Soufrière, Guadeloupe (Lesser Antilles).\r\n\r\nThe most powerful eruptions are called “plinian” and involve the\r\nexplosive ejection of relatively viscous lava. Large plinian\r\neruptions—such as during 18 May 1980 at Mount St. Helens or, more\r\nrecently, during 15 June 1991 at Pinatubo in the Philippines—can send\r\nash and volcanic gas tens of miles into the air. The resulting ash\r\nfallout can affect large areas hundreds of miles downwind. Fast-moving\r\ndeadly pyroclastic flows (“nuées ardentes”) are also commonly associated\r\nwith plinian eruptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, 1959.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Taal Volcano, Philippines, 1965.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Submarine Volcanoes\r\n\r\n\r\nSubmarine volcanoes and volcanic vents are common features on certain\r\nzones of the ocean floor. Some are active at the present time and, in\r\nshallow water, disclose their presence by blasting steam and rock-debris\r\nhigh above the surface of the sea. Many others lie at such great depths\r\nthat the tremendous weight of the water above them results in high,\r\nconfining pressure and prevents the formation and explosive release of\r\nsteam and gases. Even very large, deep-water eruptions may not disturb\r\nthe ocean surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Schematic representation of a typical submarine eruption\r\nin the open ocean.]\r\n\r\nThe unlimited supply of water surrounding submarine volcanoes can cause\r\nthem to behave differently from volcanoes on land. Violent, steam-blast\r\neruptions take place when sea water pours into active shallow submarine\r\nvents. Lava, erupting onto a shallow sea floor or flowing into the sea\r\nfrom land, may cool so rapidly that it shatters into sand and rubble.\r\nThe result is the production of huge amounts of fragmental volcanic\r\ndebris. The famous “black sand” beaches of Hawaii were created virtually\r\ninstantaneously by the violent interaction between hot lava and sea\r\nwater. On the other hand, recent observations made from deep-diving\r\nsubmersibles have shown that some submarine eruptions produce flows and\r\nother volcanic structures remarkably similar to those formed on land.\r\nRecent studies have revealed the presence of spectacular,\r\nhigh-temperature hydrothermal plumes and vents (called “smokers”) along\r\nsome parts of the mid-oceanic volcanic rift systems. However, to date,\r\nno direct observation has been made of a deep submarine eruption in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nDuring an explosive submarine eruption in the shallow open ocean,\r\nenormous piles of debris are built up around the active volcanic vent.\r\nOcean currents rework the debris in shallow water, while other debris\r\nslumps from the upper part of the cone and flows into deep water along\r\nthe sea floor. Fine debris and ash in the eruptive plume are scattered\r\nover a wide area in airborne clouds. Coarse debris in the same eruptive\r\nplume rains into the sea and settles on the flanks of the cone. Pumice\r\nfrom the eruption floats on the water and drifts with the ocean currents\r\nover a large area.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Submarine eruption of Myojin-sho Volcano, Izu Islands,\r\nJapan on September 23, 1952.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Geysers, Fumaroles, and Hot Springs\r\n\r\n\r\nGeysers, fumaroles (also called _solfataras_), and hot springs are\r\ngenerally found in regions of young volcanic activity. Surface water\r\npercolates downward through the rocks below the Earth’s surface to\r\nhigh-temperature regions surrounding a magma reservoir, either active or\r\nrecently solidified but still hot. There the water is heated, becomes\r\nless dense, and rises back to the surface along fissures and cracks.\r\nSometimes these features are called “dying volcanoes” because they seem\r\nto represent the last stage of volcanic activity as the magma, at depth,\r\ncools and hardens.\r\n\r\nErupting geysers provide spectacular displays of underground energy\r\nsuddenly unleashed, but their mechanisms are not completely understood.\r\nLarge amounts of hot water are presumed to fill underground cavities.\r\nThe water, upon further heating, is violently ejected when a portion of\r\nit suddenly flashes into steam. This cycle can be repeated with\r\nremarkable regularity, as for example, at Old Faithful Geyser in\r\nYellowstone National Park, which erupts on an average of about once\r\nevery 65 minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Faithful Geyser, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.]\r\n\r\nFumaroles, which emit mixtures of steam and other gases, are fed by\r\nconduits that pass through the water table before reaching the surface\r\nof the ground. Hydrogen sulfide (HࠢS), one of the typical gases issuing\r\nfrom fumaroles, readily oxidizes to sulfuric acid and native sulfur.\r\nThis accounts for the intense chemical activity and brightly colored\r\nrocks in many thermal areas.\r\n\r\nHot springs occur in many thermal areas where the surface of the Earth\r\nintersects the water table. The temperature and rate of discharge of hot\r\nsprings depend on factors such as the rate at which water circulates\r\nthrough the system of underground channelways, the amount of heat\r\nsupplied at depth, and the extent of dilution of the heated water by\r\ncool ground water near the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Black Growler steam vents (fumaroles), Norris Basin,\r\nYellowstone National Park, Wyoming.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Volcano Environments\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are more than 500 active volcanoes (those that have erupted at\r\nleast once within recorded history) in the world—50 of which are in the\r\nUnited States (Hawaii, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and\r\nCalifornia)—although many more are hidden under the seas. Most active\r\nvolcanoes are strung like beads along, or near, the margins of the\r\ncontinents, and more than half encircle the Pacific Ocean as a “Ring of\r\nFire.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The distribution of some of the Earth’s 500 active\r\nvolcanoes.]\r\n\r\nMany volcanoes are in and around the Mediterranean Sea. Mount Etna in\r\nSicily is the largest and highest of these mountains. Italy’s Vesuvius\r\nis the only active volcano on the European mainland. Near the island of\r\nVulcano, the volcano Stromboli has been in a state of nearly continuous,\r\nmild eruption since early Roman times. At night, sailors in the\r\nMediterranean can see the glow from the fiery molten material that is\r\nhurled into the air. Very appropriately, Stromboli has been called “the\r\nlighthouse of the Mediterranean.”\r\n\r\nSome volcanoes crown island areas lying near the continents, and others\r\nform chains of islands in the deep ocean basins. Volcanoes tend to\r\ncluster along narrow mountainous belts where folding and fracturing of\r\nthe rocks provide channelways to the surface for the escape of magma.\r\nSignificantly, major earthquakes also occur along these belts,\r\nindicating that volcanism and seismic activity are often closely\r\nrelated, responding to the same dynamic Earth forces.\r\n\r\nIn a typical “island-arc” environment, volcanoes lie along the crest of\r\nan arcuate, crustal ridge bounded on its convex side by a deep oceanic\r\ntrench. The granite or granitelike layer of the continental crust\r\nextends beneath the ridge to the vicinity of the trench. Basaltic\r\nmagmas, generated in the mantle beneath the ridge, rise along fractures\r\nthrough the granitic layer. These magmas commonly will be modified or\r\nchanged in composition during passage through the granitic layer and\r\nerupt on the surface to form volcanoes built largely of non-basaltic\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount Sinabung, Sumatra (By J. Baylor Roberts (c)\r\nNational Geographic Society).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Island-arc environment]\r\n\r\nIn a typical “oceanic” environment, volcanoes are aligned along the\r\ncrest of a broad ridge that marks an active fracture system in the\r\noceanic crust. Basaltic magmas, generated in the upper mantle beneath\r\nthe ridge, rise along fractures through the basaltic layer. Because the\r\ngranitic crustal layer is absent, the magmas are not appreciably\r\nmodified or changed in composition and they erupt on the surface to form\r\nbasaltic volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mauna Kea Volcano, Hawaii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oceanic environment]\r\n\r\nIn the typical “continental” environment, volcanoes are located in\r\nunstable, mountainous belts that have thick roots of granite or\r\ngranitelike rock. Magmas, generated near the base of the mountain root,\r\nrise slowly or intermittently along fractures in the crust. During\r\npassage through the granitic layer, magmas are commonly modified or\r\nchanged in composition and erupt on the surface to form volcanoes\r\nconstructed of nonbasaltic rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount Adams, Washington.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Continental environment]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Plate-Tectonics Theory\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the Pacific Northwest, the Juan de Fuca Plate plunges\r\nbeneath the North American Plate, locally melting at depth; the magma\r\nrises to feed and form the Cascade volcanoes.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the now generally accepted “plate-tectonics” theory,\r\nscientists believe that the Earth’s surface is broken into a number of\r\nshifting slabs or plates, which average about 50 miles in thickness.\r\nThese plates move relative to one another above a hotter, deeper, more\r\nmobile zone at average rates as great as a few inches per year. Most of\r\nthe world’s active volcanoes are located along or near the boundaries\r\nbetween shifting plates and are called “plate-boundary” volcanoes.\r\nHowever, some active volcanoes are not associated with plate boundaries,\r\nand many of these so-called “intra-plate” volcanoes form roughly linear\r\nchains in the interior of some oceanic plates. The Hawaiian Islands\r\nprovide perhaps the best example of an “intra-plate” volcanic chain,\r\ndeveloped by the northwest-moving Pacific plate passing over an inferred\r\n“hot spot” that initiates the magma-generation and volcano-formation\r\nprocess. The peripheral areas of the Pacific Ocean Basin, containing the\r\nboundaries of several plates, are dotted by many active volcanoes that\r\nform the so-called “Ring of Fire.” The “Ring” provides excellent\r\nexamples of “plate-boundary” volcanoes, including Mount St. Helens.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying figure shows the boundaries of lithosphere plates that\r\nare presently active. The double lines indicate zones of spreading from\r\nwhich plates are moving apart. The lines with barbs show zones of\r\nunderthrusting (subduction), where one plate is sliding beneath another.\r\nThe barbs on the lines indicate the overriding plate. The single line\r\ndefines a strike-slip fault along which plates are sliding horizontally\r\npast one another. The stippled areas indicate a part of a continent,\r\nexclusive of that along a plate boundary, which is undergoing active\r\nextensional, compressional, or strike-slip faulting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Major tectonic plates of the Earth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Extraterrestrial Volcanism\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mariner 9 imagery of Olympus Mons Volcano on Mars\r\ncompared to the eight principal Hawaiian Islands at the same scale\r\n(Mariner 9 Image Mosaic, NASA/JPL).]\r\n\r\nVolcanoes and volcanism are not restricted to the planet Earth. Manned\r\nand unmanned planetary explorations, beginning in the late 1960’s, have\r\nfurnished graphic evidence of past volcanism and its products on the\r\nMoon, Mars, Venus and other planetary bodies. Many pounds of volcanic\r\nrocks were collected by astronauts during the various Apollo lunar\r\nlanding missions. Only a small fraction of these samples have been\r\nsubjected to exhaustive study by scientists. The bulk of the material is\r\nstored under controlled-environment conditions at NASA’s Lunar Receiving\r\nLaboratory in Houston, Tex., for future study by scientists.\r\n\r\nFrom the 1976-1979 Viking mission, scientists have been able to study\r\nthe volcanoes on Mars, and their studies are very revealing when\r\ncompared with those of volcanoes on Earth. For example, Martian and\r\nHawaiian volcanoes closely resemble each other in form. Both are shield\r\nvolcanoes, have gently sloping flanks, large multiple collapse pits at\r\ntheir centers, and appear to be built of fluid lavas that have left\r\nnumerous flow features on their flanks. The most obvious difference\r\nbetween the two is size. The Martian shields are enormous. They can grow\r\nto over 17 miles in height and more than 350 miles across, in contrast\r\nto a maximum height of about 6 miles and width of 74 miles for the\r\nHawaiian shields.\r\n\r\nVoyager-2 spacecraft images taken of Io, a moon of Jupiter, captured\r\nvolcanoes in the actual process of eruption. The volcanic plumes shown\r\non the image rise some 60 to 100 miles above the surface of the moon.\r\nThus, active volcanism is taking place, at present, on at least one\r\nplanetary body in addition to our Earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spacecraft image, made in July 1979, shows volcanic plume\r\nrising some 60 to 100 miles above the surface of Io, a moon of Jupiter\r\n(Voyager 2 photo, NASA).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Volcano Monitoring and Research\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the science of “volcanology” originated with the\r\naccurate descriptions of the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79 contained\r\nin two letters from Pliny the Younger to the Roman historian Tacitus.\r\nPliny’s letters also described the death of his uncle, Pliny the Elder,\r\nwho was killed in the eruption. Actually, however, it was not until the\r\n19th century that serious scientific inquiry into volcanic phenomena\r\nflourished as part of the general revolution in the physical and life\r\nsciences, including the new science of “geology.” In 1847, an\r\nobservatory was established on the flanks of Vesuvius, upslope from the\r\nsite of Herculaneum, for the more or less continuous recording of the\r\nactivity of the volcano that destroyed the city in A.D. 79. Still,\r\nthrough the first decade of the 20th century, the study of volcanoes by\r\nand large continued to be of an expeditionary nature, generally\r\nundertaken after the eruption had begun or the activity had ceased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano\r\nObservatory, on the crater rim of Kilauea Volcano.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps “modern” volcanology began in 1912, when Thomas A. Jaggar, Head\r\nof the Geology Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\r\nfounded the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO), located on the rim of\r\nKilauea’s caldera. Initially supported by an association of Honolulu\r\nbusinessmen, HVO began to conduct systematic and continuous monitoring\r\nof seismic activity preceding, accompanying, and following eruptions, as\r\nwell as a wide variety of other geological, geophysical, and geochemical\r\nobservations and investigations. Between 1919 and 1948, HVO was\r\nadministered by various Federal agencies (National Weather Service, U.S.\r\nGeological Survey, and National Park Service), and since 1948 it has\r\nbeen operated continuously by the Geological Survey as part of its\r\nVolcano Hazards Program. The more than 75 years of comprehensive\r\ninvestigations by HVO and other scientists in Hawaii have added\r\nsubstantially to our understanding of the eruptive mechanisms of Kilauea\r\nand Mauna Loa, two of the world’s most active volcanoes. Moreover, the\r\nHawaiian Volcano Observatory pioneered and refined most of the commonly\r\nused volcano-monitoring techniques presently employed by other\r\nobservatories monitoring active volcanoes elsewhere, principally in\r\nIndonesia, Italy, Japan, Latin America, New Zealand, Lesser Antilles\r\n(Caribbean), Philippines, and Kamchatka (U.S.S.R.).\r\n\r\nWhat does “volcano monitoring” actually involve? Basically, it is the\r\nkeeping of a detailed “diary” of the changes—visible and invisible—in a\r\nvolcano and its surroundings. Between eruptions, visible changes of\r\nimportance to the scientists would include marked increase or decrease\r\nof steaming from known vents; emergence of new steaming areas;\r\ndevelopment of new ground cracks or widening of old ones; unusual or\r\ninexplicable withering of plant life; changes in the color of mineral\r\ndeposits encrusting fumaroles; and any other directly observable, and\r\noften measurable, feature that might reflect a change in the state of\r\nthe volcano. Of course, the “diary” keeping during eruptive activity\r\npresents additional tasks. Wherever and whenever they can do so safely,\r\nscientists document, in words and on film, the course of the eruption in\r\ndetail; make temperature measurements of lava and gas; collect the\r\neruptive products and gases for subsequent laboratory analysis; measure\r\nthe heights of lava fountains or ash plumes; gage the flow rate of ash\r\nejection or lava flows; and carry out other necessary observations and\r\nmeasurements to fully document and characterize the eruption. For each\r\neruption, such documentation and data collection and analysis provide\r\nanother building block in constructing a model of the characteristic\r\nbehavior of a given volcano or type of eruption.\r\n\r\nVolcano monitoring also involves the recording and analysis of volcanic\r\nphenomena not visible to the human eye, but measurable by precise and\r\nsophisticated instruments. These phenomena include ground movements,\r\nearthquakes (particularly those too small to be felt by people),\r\nvariations in gas compositions, and deviations in local electrical and\r\nmagnetic fields that respond to pressure and stresses caused by the\r\nsubterranean magma movements.\r\n\r\nSome common methods used to study invisible, volcano-related phenomena\r\nare based on:\r\n\r\n1. Measurement of changes in the shape of the volcano—volcanoes\r\ngradually swell or “inflate” in building up to an eruption because of\r\nthe influx of magma into the volcano’s reservoir or “plumbing system”;\r\nwith the onset of eruption, pressure is immediately relieved and the\r\nvolcano rapidly shrinks or “deflates.” A wide variety of instruments,\r\nincluding precise spirit-levels, electronic “tiltmeters,” and\r\nelectronic-laser beam instruments, can measure changes in the slope or\r\n“tilt” of the volcano or in vertical and horizontal distances with a\r\nprecision of only a few parts in a million.\r\n\r\n2. Precise determination of the location and magnitude of earthquakes by\r\na well-designed seismic network—as the volcano inflates by the rise of\r\nmagma, the enclosing rocks are deformed to the breaking point to\r\naccommodate magma movement. When the rock ultimately fails to permit\r\ncontinued magma ascent, earthquakes result. By carefully mapping out the\r\nvariations with time in the locations and depths of earthquake foci,\r\nscientists in effect can track the subsurface movement of magma,\r\nhorizontally and vertically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scientist, wearing asbestos gloves and gas mask, samples\r\nvolcanic gases from active vent.]\r\n\r\n3. Measurement of changes in volcanic-gas composition and in magnetic\r\nfield—the rise of magma high into the volcanic edifice may allow some of\r\nthe associated gases to escape along fractures, thereby causing the\r\ncomposition of the gases (measured at the surface) to differ from that\r\nusually measured when the volcano is quiescent and the magma is too deep\r\nto allow gas to escape. Changes in the Earth’s magnetic field have been\r\nnoted preceding and accompanying some eruptions, and such changes are\r\nbelieved to reflect temperature effects and/or the content of magnetic\r\nminerals in the magma.\r\n\r\nRecording historic eruptions and modern volcano-monitoring in themselves\r\nare insufficient to fully determine the characteristic behavior of a\r\nvolcano, because a time record of such information, though perhaps long\r\nin human terms, is much too short in geologic terms to permit reliable\r\npredictions of possible future behavior. A comprehensive investigation\r\nof any volcano must also include the careful, systematic mapping of the\r\nnature, volume, and distribution of the products of prehistoric\r\neruptions, as well as the determination of their ages by modern isotopic\r\nand other dating methods. Research on the volcano’s geologic past\r\nextends the data base for refined estimates of the recurrence intervals\r\nof active versus dormant periods in the history of the volcano. With\r\nsuch information in hand, scientists can construct so-called “volcanic\r\nhazards” maps that delineate the zones of greatest risk around the\r\nvolcano and that designate which zones are particularly susceptible to\r\ncertain types of volcanic hazards (lava flows, ash fall, toxic gases,\r\nmudflows and associated flooding, etc.).\r\n\r\nA strikingly successful example of volcano research and volcanic-hazard\r\nassessment was the 1978 publication (Bulletin 1383-C) by two Geological\r\nSurvey scientists, Dwight Crandell and Donal Mullineaux, who concluded\r\nthat Mount St. Helens was the Cascade volcano most frequently active in\r\nthe past 4,500 years and the one most likely to reawaken to erupt, “...\r\nperhaps before the end of this century.” Their prediction came true when\r\nMount St. Helens rumbled back to life in March of 1980. Intermittent\r\nexplosions of ash and steam and periodic formation of short-lived lava\r\ndomes continued throughout the decade. Analysis of the volcano’s past\r\nbehavior indicates that this kind of eruptive activity may continue for\r\nyears or decades, but another catastrophic eruption like that of May 18,\r\n1980, is unlikely to occur soon.\r\n\r\nOn 18 May 1982, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) formally dedicated the\r\nDavid A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) in Vancouver,\r\nWashington, in memory of the Survey volcanologist killed two years\r\nearlier. This facility—a sister observatory to the Hawaiian Volcano\r\nObservatory—facilitates the increased monitoring and research on not\r\nonly Mount St. Helens but also the other volcanoes of the Cascade Range\r\nof the Pacific Northwest. More recently, in cooperation with the State\r\nof Alaska, the USGS established the Alaska Volcano Observatory in March\r\n1988. The work being done at these volcano observatories provides\r\nimportant comparisons and contrasts between the behavior of the\r\ngenerally non-explosive Hawaiian shield volcanoes and that of the\r\ngenerally explosive composite volcanoes of the Cascade and Alaskan\r\nPeninsula-Aleutian chains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Volcanoes and People\r\n\r\n\r\nVolcanoes both harass and help mankind. As dramatically demonstrated by\r\nthe catastrophic eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 1980 and of\r\nPinatubo in June 1991, volcanoes can wreak havoc and devastation in the\r\nshort term. The types of volcanic and associated hazards are not\r\ndescribed in this booklet but treated in several of the publications\r\nlisted in _Suggested Reading_. However, it should be emphasized that the\r\nshort-term hazards posed by volcanoes are balanced by benefits of\r\nvolcanism and related processes over geologic time. Volcanic materials\r\nultimately break down to form some of the most fertile soils on Earth,\r\ncultivation of which fostered and sustained civilizations. People use\r\nvolcanic products as construction materials, as abrasive and cleaning\r\nagents, and as raw materials for many chemical and industrial uses. The\r\ninternal heat associated with some young volcanic systems has been\r\nharnessed to produce geothermal energy. For example, the electrical\r\nenergy generated from The Geysers geothermal field in northern\r\nCalifornia can meet the present power consumption of the city of San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nThe challenge to scientists involved with volcano research is to\r\nmitigate the short-term adverse impacts of eruptions, so that society\r\nmay continue to enjoy the long-term benefits of volcanism. They must\r\ncontinue to improve the capability for predicting eruptions and to\r\nprovide decision makers and the general public with the best possible\r\ninformation on high-risk volcanoes for sound decisions on land-use\r\nplanning and public safety. Geo-scientists still do not fully understand\r\nhow volcanoes really work, but considerable advances have been made in\r\nrecent decades. An improved understanding of volcanic phenomena provides\r\nimportant clues to the Earth’s past, present, and possibly its future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Suggested Reading\r\n\r\n\r\n  Decker, Robert, and Decker, Barbara, 1989, Volcanoes: W.H.
