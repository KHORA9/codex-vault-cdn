ES L.\r\n\r\nAgrégé d'Histoire et de Géographie\r\n\r\nTranslated by Joseph McCabe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nT. Fisher Unwin Ltd\r\nLondon: Adelphi Terrace\r\n\r\nFirst published in English in 1922\r\n\r\n(All rights reserved)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters I have endeavoured to indicate the\r\nessential aspects of colonization in modern Argentina: the conquest\r\nof the soil by man, the exploitation of its natural resources, the\r\ndevelopment of agriculture and cattle-breeding, and the growth of the\r\npopulation and enlargement of the urban centres.\r\n\r\nFor a new country like Argentina it is not convenient to adopt the\r\nstrictly regional plan which seems to be the best means of giving\r\na complete and methodical description of the historic countries of\r\nwestern Europe, where it is the only way to keep in close touch with\r\nthe geographical facts. In western Europe each region is really an\r\nindependent unity. It has for ages lived upon its own resources; each\r\npopulation-group has its horizon definitely limited; and the complex\r\naction of the environment upon man, and of man upon the country,\r\nhas proceeded in each district rather on the lines of an isolated\r\nand impassioned dialogue between the two. It is quite different in\r\nArgentina. There, many of the facts which we have to record consist in\r\nan expansion of the population, a spread of methods of exploitation\r\nfrom zone to zone of the country, and the influence upon colonization\r\nof commerce and of the varying needs of the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to reply in advance to a criticism which my Argentine\r\nfriends are sure to make. They will complain that I have paid no\r\nattention to the people of Argentina, the creators of the greatness of\r\nthe country. It is true that I have deliberately refrained from any\r\nreference to the political and moral life of the Republic, the national\r\ncharacter and its evolution, the stoicism of the gaucho, the industry\r\nof the colonist and the merchant, or the patriotism of the Argentinians\r\ngenerally. My work is not a study of the Argentine nation, but a\r\ngeographical introduction to such a study.\r\n\r\nI began the work during a stay in Argentina which lasted from April\r\n1912 to August 1914. In the course of these two years I was able to\r\nvisit most parts of the country; and, as the information I gathered\r\nduring my travels is one of my chief sources, I give here a summary of\r\nmy itineraries.\r\n\r\n     _October-November 1912_: Rosario--Region of the\r\n     colonies of Santa Fé--Forestry-industries of the Chaco\r\n     Santiagueño--Bañados of the Rio Dulce--Salta--Jujuy--Sierra de\r\n     la Lumbrera.\r\n\r\n     _November-December 1912_: Tucumán--Valley of Tapi--Santa Maria\r\n     to the west of Aconcagua--Cafayate (Valley of Calchaqui).\r\n\r\n     _December 1912-January 1913_: Catamarca--Andalgala--Valley of\r\n     Pucara--Córdoba--Villa Maria.\r\n\r\n     _January-February 1913_: Region of the Pampas (Province of\r\n     Buenos Aires, south of Córdoba and of S. Luis, district of the\r\n     Central Pampa).\r\n\r\n     _March 1913_: Corrientes--Posadas--Asunción--Forest-industries\r\n     of the Chaco of Santa Fé.\r\n\r\n     _August 1913_: Region of the Pampas (Province of Buenos Aires).\r\n\r\n     _March 1914_: Lake Nahuel Huapi--Valcheta--San Antonio--The\r\n     Rio Negro.\r\n\r\n     _April 1914_: Rioja--Sierra de los Llanos--San Juan--Mendoza.\r\n\r\n     _July 1914_: Entre Rios.\r\n\r\nThese journeys, by rail or on well-known roads, were not supposed to\r\nbe for the purpose of exploration or discovery. Their one object was\r\nto enable me to make a provisional classification of the chief types\r\nof country and forms of colonization, and to draw up a methodical\r\nprogramme for more thorough research. The work which I trusted to\r\ndo in a more leisurely way was, however, suspended in 1914, and, in\r\nspite of my very strong desire to do so, I was unable to resume it on\r\nthe spot in 1919. I have therefore been compelled to publish my first\r\nobservations, completing them, as well as I could, by a bibliographical\r\nstudy of the country. I have made use of some fragments of a popular\r\nwork which I began, at the request of the Argentine Commission, for the\r\nInternational Exhibition at San Francisco, of which several chapters\r\nwere published in my absence by the University of Tucumán (Pierre\r\nDenis, _Modern Argentina: Chapters of Economic Geography_. Publications\r\nof the University during the Centenary of the Congress of Tucumán of\r\n1816. Buenos Aires, 1916).[1]\r\n\r\n     [1] I take the opportunity to thank M. J. B. Teran, who\r\n     undertook to edit these chapters, and to express, with him, my\r\n     satisfaction that events have falsified his rather pessimistic\r\n     predictions as regards the author.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of the publications on Argentina has two conspicuous\r\ngaps. The first is deliberate. I declined to study at second hand the\r\ndocuments and chronicles which are our sources, to the end of the\r\neighteenth century, for the history of the various provinces that were\r\nto form Argentina. Hence the historical data on colonization which\r\nwill be found in the following chapters relate almost entirely to the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe second gap I was, to my great disappointment, unable to fill up.\r\nA large part of the local publications--official or other--maps,\r\nstatistics, etc., never reached Europe, and Buenos Aires is the only\r\nplace where one can make a thorough study of them. These publications\r\nwere available to me until 1914. Since then I have been restricted to\r\nthe resources of the Paris and London libraries, which are very scanty;\r\nand less has been sent from Argentina since the war. I have not the\r\ncomplete statistics up to date.\r\n\r\nI trust, however, that this picture of Argentina has much more than\r\na retrospective character; that it is not out of date before it is\r\npublished. I may add that no statistics would enable one to solve\r\nthe problem which Argentina in 1920 presents to an observer. Has the\r\nEuropean War merely retarded the economic evolution of the country,\r\nor has it given that evolution a new direction? Will or will not the\r\nrelations which Argentina is now resuming with the rest of the world be\r\nof the same character as the pre-war relations?\r\n\r\nThe effects of the war upon the life of the country must not all be\r\nput on the same footing. That some of the exporters to Argentina\r\nhave gained by the war and others lost--that the share of the United\r\nStates, and even of Japan, has greatly increased--is a fact that\r\nmay be regarded from the Argentinian point of view as of secondary\r\nimportance. The war has, moreover, had the effect of disorganizing\r\nmarine transport and bringing about a sort of relative isolation which\r\nis not yet quite over. The reduction in the imports of English coal has\r\nmade the petroleum wells of Rivadavia of greater value to the country.\r\nIt has compelled the Argentinians to make a hurried inventory of their\r\nnatural resources in the way of fuel. Local industries have tried to\r\nmeet the needs of the Argentinian market, where they had no longer to\r\nbear the competition of European goods. The grave disturbance of prices\r\nhas enabled them to export certain products which had hitherto been\r\nconfined to home markets. The war has, moreover, not interfered with\r\nthe existing streams of export on a large scale from Argentina. The\r\nRepublic continues to send its cereals, meat, hides and wool to Europe;\r\nand there is no reason to suppose that the competition of buyers is\r\nlikely to diminish, or that the cultivation of wheat and lucerne must\r\nbecome less profitable.\r\n\r\nThe two essential effects of the war seem to have been the stopping of\r\nthe stream of immigration and the progressive reduction of the support\r\nwhich Europe gave to the work of colonization in the form of advances\r\nof capital.\r\n\r\nFrom 1914 to 1918 only 272,000 immigrants landed at Buenos Aires, while\r\n482,000 emigrants left the country. In 1918 the figure of immigration\r\nand emigration was only 47,000, less than a tenth of what it was in a\r\nnormal year before the war. The withdrawal of European capital was felt\r\nfrom the very beginning of the war, and it has gone on uninterruptedly,\r\ncapital from North America not being enough to supply the deficiency\r\nentirely. At the same time the extraordinarily favourable balance\r\nof trade has led to the storing of an ample reserve of capital in\r\nthe country. Argentina has, in a very short time, won a financial\r\nindependence which, in normal conditions, would have entailed long\r\nyears of work and prosperity.\r\n\r\nHowever it may seem, these two facts--the interruption of immigration\r\nand the accumulation of capital--cannot be considered independently\r\nof each other. The inquiry opened by the Social Museum of Argentina\r\n(_La inmigración después de la guerra_, Museo Social Argentino, \"Bol.\r\nMensual,\" viii, 1919, nos. 85-90) show that a speedy restoration of\r\nimmigration is expected in the Republic. Certainly it seems clear\r\nthat the political and social insecurity in Europe, the misery of the\r\nold world, will probably enhance the attractions of Argentina. We\r\nmust remember, however, that the stream of emigration from Europe to\r\nthe Republic in the nineteenth, and the beginning of the twentieth,\r\ncentury was provoked by a complex combination of economic conditions\r\nwhich were closely related to each other. High wages in Argentina were\r\nconnected with the high interest on money; that is to say, in other\r\nwords, with the scarcity of capital. The future will decide whether\r\nimmigration, and the rapid progress of colonization and production,\r\nwhich characterize pre-war Argentina can be adjusted to the policy of\r\naccumulation of capital to which the war has condemned the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                     PAGE\r\n  INTRODUCTION                                                          5\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n  THE NATURAL REGIONS OF ARGENTINA                                     17\r\n       The physical environment--Colonization and the natural\r\n       regions--The struggle with the Indians--Argentine\r\n       unity--Argentina and the world.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n  THE OASES OF THE NORTH-WEST                                          36\r\n       The inhabited zones of the Andes in the north-west--_Valles_,\r\n       _Quebradas_, _Puna_--The irrigation of the _valles_--The\r\n       historic routes--Convoys of stock--The breeding of mules and\r\n       the fairs--The struggle of the breeders against drought--The\r\n       Sierra de los Llanos.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III\r\n  TUCUMÁN AND MENDOZA                                                  68\r\n       Tucumán and the road to Chile--The climate and the cultivation\r\n       of the sugar-cane--The problem of manual labour--Irrigation at\r\n       Mendoza--Water-rights--Viticulture--Protection and the natural\r\n       conditions.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV\r\n  THE EXPLOITATION OF THE FORESTS                                      96\r\n       Manual labour on the _obrajes_--The land of the _bañados_\r\n       and the agricultural cantons of Corrientes--The timber-yards\r\n       of the Chaco and the tannic-acid works of the Paraná--The\r\n       exploitation of the _maté_--The forestry industry and\r\n       colonization.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V\r\n  PATAGONIA AND SHEEP-REARING                                         119\r\n       The arid tableland and the region of glacial lakes--The\r\n       first settlements on the Patagonian coast and the indigenous\r\n       population--Extensive breeding--The use of pasture on the\r\n       lands of the Rio Negro--Transhumation.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI\r\n  THE PLAIN OF THE PAMPAS                                             161\r\n       The limits of the prairie--The rains--The wind and the\r\n       formation of the clay of the Pampas--The wind and the\r\n       contour--The zones of colonization on the Pampas--Hunting\r\n       wild cattle and primitive breeding--The sheep-farms--The\r\n       ranches--The region of \"colonies\"--The region of lucerne,\r\n       maize, and wheat--The combination of agriculture and\r\n       breeding--The economic mechanism of colonization--The\r\n       exchanges between the different zones of the Pampas.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII\r\n  ROADS AND RAILWAYS                                                  209\r\n       Roads on the plain--The salt road--The \"trade\r\n       route\"--Transport by ox-waggons--_Arrieros_ and\r\n       _Troperos_--Railways and colonization--The trade in\r\n       cereals--Home traffic and the reorganization of the system.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII\r\n  THE RIVER-ROUTES                                                    234\r\n       The use of the river before steam navigation--Floods--The\r\n       river plain--The bed of the Paraná and its changes--The\r\n       estuary and its shoals--Maritime navigation--The boats on the\r\n       Paraná.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IX\r\n  THE POPULATION                                                      260\r\n       The distribution of the population--The streams of emigration\r\n       to the interior--Seasonal migrations--The historic towns--The\r\n       towns of the Pampean region--Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY                                                        277\r\n\r\n  INDEX                                                               291\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE\r\n\r\n      I.

The lofty chains of the Andes stretch along the Pacific\r\ncoast; at the foot of these are immense alluvial tablelands; further\r\neast are the level plains of the Atlantic coast. The eastern zone,\r\nthe tablelands, ends southward at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata.\r\nIt enters Argentine territory only in the north-east corner of the\r\nprovince of Misiones. Below 35° S. lat. the alluvial plains open freely\r\nupon the ocean. The position of Buenos Aires, in the threshold of the\r\nplain of the Pampas, is somewhat like that of Chicago at the beginning\r\nof the prairies; if you imagine the north-eastern States and eastern\r\nCanada struck off the map, and the sea penetrating inland as far as the\r\nLakes.\r\n\r\nThe three essential aspects of Argentine scenery are mountain, plain,\r\nand river. The Paraná, indeed, is a whole natural region in itself,\r\nwith its arms and its islands, and the ever-changing low plain over\r\nwhich its floods spread, as one sees it from the top of the clay\r\n_barrancas_ (cliffs); though it is so broad that one cannot see the\r\nopposite bank. It wanders over the plain like a foreigner, an emissary\r\nfrom tropical America; for it has a flora of its own and tepid waters\r\nwhich often cause a fog over the estuary where they mingle with the\r\nwaters of the sea.\r\n\r\nFrom the general mass of the Argentine plains, we must set apart the\r\nregion between the Paraná and the Uruguay, which Argentinians call\r\n\"Mesopotamia.\" While æolian clays form the soil of the Pampa on the\r\nright bank of the Paraná, fluvial deposits--sands and gravel, in which\r\nit is impossible to distinguish the contribution of the Uruguay from\r\nthat of the Paraná--cover a great part of Mesopotamia. The earlier beds\r\nof the rivers may be traced here, not only by the alluvial deposits\r\nthey have left, but by the lagoons which still mark their course.\r\nRunning waters have shaped the landscape and scooped out a system of\r\nsecondary valleys, and these reflect the history of the river itself\r\nand the variations of base-level which led to alternate periods of\r\nerosion and deposit.\r\n\r\nOn the right bank, on the contrary, the Paraná has no tributaries of\r\nany importance except at the extreme north of the country. The scarcity\r\nof running water is, in fact, one of the characteristic features of\r\nthe plain of the Pampas. Except in the east, along the Paraná, where a\r\nnetwork of permanent streams develops on a comparatively impermeable\r\nand fairly humid soil, and except at the foot of the mountains, where\r\nirregular torrents and streams, swollen after a storm and scanty in\r\nthe dry season, disappear, as a rule, within sight of the hills that\r\ngave them birth, there is no superficial organized drainage. As a\r\nwhole, the alluvial covering of the Pampas, the upper beds of which are\r\ncut through by the _barranca_ of the Paraná, is not of river origin;\r\nit was brought and distributed by the wind, which took the place of\r\nrunning water. The clay of the Pampas is a present from the winds. The\r\nincreasing dryness of the climate toward the west, as one approaches\r\nthe Cordillera, explains the feebleness of the erosion by water and the\r\nextent of the erosion by wind.\r\n\r\nIt is aridity, too, that gives their particular character to the\r\nArgentine Andes. They have little trace of perpetual snow, the lower\r\nlimit of which approaches to within about four miles of the Bolivian\r\nfrontier. There are no glaciers there; they reappear in the south\r\nonly in the latitude of San Juan and Mendoza, on the flanks of the\r\nthree giants of the southern Cordillera, Mercedario, Aconcagua, and\r\nTupungato. Below the small number of steep furrows which the glaciers\r\nhave carved, and usually up to the top of the mountain, there spreads\r\nwhat has been called, very expressively, \"the zone of rubbish.\" In this\r\nthe winter's snows, fretted by the sun in that clear atmosphere, form\r\nthose multitudes of narrow pyramids which the Argentinians compare to\r\nprocessions of white-robed pilgrims. The underlying rock is rarely\r\nvisible. It is covered with a thick cloak of rubbish, split off by the\r\nfrost, which the slow-moving waters released by the melting of the\r\nsnows heap up at the foot of the slopes, at the bottom of depressions.\r\nThe half-buried summits are succeeded by basins of accumulation. In\r\nthe valleys round the mountains there are immense beds of detritic,\r\nhalf-rounded shingle. The torrents have cut their way through the\r\nalluvial mass, and they flow at the foot of high terraces which mark\r\nthe sites of former valleys.\r\n\r\nThe spread of colonization toward the south during the last generation\r\nhas extended Argentine territory beyond the limits of these classic\r\nscenes. The Patagonian Andes differ profoundly from the Northern Andes;\r\nand the change is not more sudden than that of the climate, to which\r\nit is due. Going toward the south, one passes, almost without a break,\r\nfrom the Atlas Mountains to Scandinavia. The moisture increases in\r\nproportion as the mean temperature falls. The mountains are covered\r\nwith snow, and the glaciers lengthen. In one part of Patagonia they\r\nstill form a continuous cap, an \"inland sea,\" concealing the rock over\r\nthe entire central zone of the Cordillera; though they are only the\r\nshrunken remainder of a glacial cap which was once far more extensive.\r\nHere ice was the chief sculptor of the scenery. It has made elevated\r\ntablelands, broadened the deep valleys which cut the flank of the\r\nmountain, polished their sides, and deposited at the point where they\r\nopen out the amphitheatres of the moraines, behind which the waters\r\nhave accumulated and formed lakes; and these lakes stretch back like\r\nfiords to the heart of the Cordillera, and are the pride of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe waters of these moisture-laden mountains have, to the east, carved\r\nout the Patagonian tableland. It is crossed by broad and boldly cut\r\nvalleys, several of which, abandoned by the rivers which scoured\r\nthem, are now dead valleys. The rubbish from the wearing down of the\r\nmountains and the glacial moraine has been spread over the whole face\r\nof the tableland in the form of beds of gravel. But the rivers that\r\nrise in the Andes cross a country of increasing aridity as they descend\r\neastward. There is no tributary to add to their volume. There is none\r\nof that softening of lines, of that idle flow of a meandering stream\r\nwhich characterizes the final stage of a river in a moist district.\r\nTheir inclination remains steep, and their waters continue to plough up\r\ncoarse sediment; and everywhere, up to the fringes of the valleys, the\r\nfluting of the sandstone and steepness of the cliffs bear witness, like\r\nthe edges of the _hamadas_ of the Sahara, to some other form of erosion\r\nthan that effected by running water--the influence on the country of\r\nthe westerly winds. On the tableland the wind polishes the rounded\r\npebbles, makes facets on them, and gives them the colouring of the\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nThus from the north to the south of Argentina there is a complete\r\ncontrast in the way in which the controlling forces of the landscape\r\nare distributed. In the north the moist winds come from the east;\r\nthe rains lessen as they pass westward. The clays, capped with black\r\nsoil, of Buenos Aires are æolian deposits, brought by the wind from\r\nthe desolate steppes which close the Pampa to the west, fixed and\r\ntransformed by the vegetation of a moister region. In the south, on\r\nthe contrary, the rains come from the Pacific, and the fluvio-glacial\r\nalluvial beds of the Patagonian tableland are evidence of copious\r\nreserves of moisture in the Andes; but the arid climate in which the\r\nwaters have left them has made its mark upon their surface.\r\n\r\nThis diversity of the physical environment is only fully brought\r\nout by colonization. It is colonization, the efforts and attempts\r\nof human industry to adjust agricultural or pastoral practices to\r\nthe natural conditions, which enable us to assign the limits of the\r\nnatural regions. In this differentiation it is essential to notice the\r\nhistorical element.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of new crops gives a geographical meaning, which\r\nhad hitherto escaped observation, to climatological limits such, for\r\ninstance, as the line of 400 millimetres of rainfall which is the\r\nwestern frontier of the region of cereals. These limits of crops remain\r\nuncertain for a time, then experience and tradition gradually fix them.\r\nThey always keep a certain elasticity, however, advancing or receding\r\naccording as the market for the particular produce is favourable or\r\nunfavourable.\r\n\r\nImprovement in the methods of exploiting the soil--the adoption of\r\nbetter agricultural machinery, dry farming, etc.--usually leads to the\r\nextension of the sphere of a particular type of colonization, as it\r\nenables this type to overcome some natural obstacle which restricted\r\nits expansion. Sometimes, however, it brings to light a new obstacle\r\nand creates a new geographical limit.\r\n\r\nTo this category belongs the northern limit of the belt of selective\r\nbreeding, which slants across the plain of the Pampas from the Sierra\r\nde Córdoba to the Paraná. The more or less degenerate cattle of the\r\nnatives had spread over the whole of the South American continent,\r\nexcept the tropical forests, since the seventeenth century, adapting\r\nthemselves easily to very different climatic conditions, from the\r\nVenezuelan _llanos_ to the _sertao_ of Bahía and the plains of\r\nArgentina. But pedigree animals, more valuable and more delicate,\r\nintroduced on to the Pampas fifty years ago, are not able to resist the\r\nmalady caused by a parasite called the _garrapate_. Hence the southern\r\nlimit of the _garrapate_ suddenly became a most important element in\r\nthe economic life of the Republic. It would lose its importance if we\r\ndiscovered a serum that would give the animals immunity against Texas\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nThe range of one and the same cause varies infinitely with the\r\ncircumstances. The limit of the prairie, as of the scrub (_monte_)\r\nwhich surrounds it on every side, and keeps it at a distance of 320 to\r\n440 miles from Buenos Aires, had no decisive influence on primitive\r\ncolonization. Whether covered with grasses or brushwood, the plain\r\nis equally suitable for extensive breeding. The ranches are the same\r\non both sides of the border. At the end of the nineteenth century,\r\nhowever, when the area of cultivation increased, the prairie was\r\nat once found to be superior. The labour required for clearing the\r\nbrushwood before the plough can work is enough to divert from it, at\r\nleast for some time, the stream of agricultural colonization. While the\r\npopulation of the _monte_, wood-cutters and breeders, are indigenous,\r\nthe prairie has absorbed the immigrants from Europe, and the border of\r\nthe scrub has become in many places an ethnographical frontier.[2]\r\n\r\n     [2] See E.

To face p. 22.]\r\n\r\nThe changes which man has made in the floral landscape are, as a rule,\r\nslight. The limits of the forest zone have scarcely been altered. The\r\nbeech forest of the southern Andes seems to be less tenacious than the\r\n_monte_ which surrounds the Pampa, and it has been ravaged by fire\r\nalong the whole edge of the southern steppe at 37° S. lat. The work of\r\nman is generally confined to changing the primitive complexion of the\r\nnatural formations, without altering their general appearance. Thus\r\nvaluable essences are disappearing from the forest and the scrub, the\r\nlarch and the cypress from the district of the Patagonian Lakes, and\r\nthe red _quebracho_ from Santiago del Estero.\r\n\r\nA change that is scarcely visible, but is of considerable economic\r\nimportance, thus takes place in the vegetation of the prairie owing to\r\nthe presence of herds. The _pasto fuerte_, composed of rough grasses,\r\nwhich is the natural vegetation, is being succeeded by the _pasto\r\ndulce_, in which annual species, soft grasses, leguminous plants,\r\netc., predominate. It is mainly composed of plants of European origin.\r\nThe difference between the _pasto dulce_ and the _pasto fuerte_ or\r\n_duro_ is so important for the farmer that there is hardly a single\r\nwork on Argentina which does not dwell on it. The idea, however,\r\nthat the _pasto dulce_ has advanced steadily westward, starting from\r\nthe vicinity of Buenos Aires and constantly enlarging its domain, is\r\nnot strictly accurate. In 1895 Holmberg[3] traced the western limit\r\nof the zone of the _pasto dulce_ through Pergamino, Junin, Bragado,\r\nAzul, Ayacucho, and Mar Chiquita. When we compare this with earlier\r\nobservations, we see that in the course of the nineteenth century the\r\nzone of the _pasto dulce_ has extended by about a hundred miles on the\r\nsouthern Pampa. When Darwin travelled from Bahía Blanca to Buenos Aires\r\nin 1833, he found no _pasto dulce_ except round Monte, on the right\r\nbank of the Salado. Further north, on the other hand, the extent of the\r\n_pasto dulce_ does not seem to have altered appreciably. The expedition\r\nto the Salt Lakes in 1778 found that there were already thistles beyond\r\nthe line of the ranches, and these are characteristic of the _pasto\r\ndulce_ in the Chivilcoy region on the Salado, which was then abandoned\r\nto herds of wild cattle. \"There was thistle enough to cook,\" says\r\nthe journal of the expedition. The difference is connected with the\r\nhistory of colonization in the province of Buenos Aires, where ground\r\nwas gained only toward the south between 1800 and 1875. Since 1895 the\r\n_pasto duro_ has been eliminated by agriculture rather than by the feet\r\nof the herds. Hence the advance of the _pasto dulce_ is no longer in\r\na continuous line moving toward the west. It is sporadic, depending\r\nupon the construction of new railways which open up the plain to the\r\nplough.[4]\r\n\r\n     [3] Holmberg, \"La Flora de la República Argentina,\" in the\r\n     _Secundo Censo de la República Argentina_, vol. i. (Buenos\r\n     Aires, 1898).\r\n\r\n     [4] _Diario de la expedition de 1778 a las Salinas_ (Coll. de\r\n     Angelis, iv.).\r\n\r\nColonization does more than emphasize the individuality of each of the\r\nnatural regions. It connects together different features, and blends\r\nthem in a complex vital organism which goes on evolving and renewing\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of the whole of the soil of Argentina by white colonists\r\nis quite a recent event. The second half of the nineteenth century was\r\ncharacterized by a rapid territorial expansion, and over more than\r\nhalf the country the expression \"new land\" must be taken literally. It\r\nis only one generation since it was taken from the Indians. There can\r\nbe no question here of tracing the history of the relations between\r\nthe white population and the free Indians of the Chaco and the Pampa.\r\nThe most formidable of these were, in the north, the Abipones and\r\nthe Tobas. On the Pampa, the foes of the colonists were Indians of\r\nAraucanian descent, Ranqueles, Pehuenches, etc., who came down from the\r\nmountains and took to horses. At the close of the eighteenth century\r\nthe frontier of Buenos Aires was on the nearer side of the Salado, and\r\nwas bordered on the south-east and north-west by the fortresses of\r\nChascomus, Monte, Lobos, Navarro, Areco, Salto, Rojas, and Melincue.\r\nThe proposal of D'Azara to extend it as far as the Salado was not\r\ncarried out, and it was not until 1828 that there was a fresh advance\r\nwestward.[5]\r\n\r\n     [5] _F. de Azara, Diario de un reconocimiento de las guardias\r\n     y fortines que guarnecen la linea frontera de Republica\r\n     Argentina_ (1796, Coll. de Angelis, vol. vi.). The documents\r\n     collected by de Angelis show clearly that there had been some\r\n     idea in the middle of the eighteenth century of occupying the\r\n     whole plain to the east of the Sierra de Tandil. These ideas\r\n     of expansion, of which D'Azara's plan is another instance,\r\n     were interrupted by the Revolution (_Diario de D. Pedro Pablo\r\n     Pabon_, Coll. de Angelis, iv. etc.).\r\n\r\nThe new frontier, which would not be altered until 1875, passed by\r\nVeinte Cinco de Mayo and Blanca Grande, at the north-western extremity\r\nof the Sierra de Tandil. It included the entire region which lies\r\nbetween the Sierra de Tandil and the lower Salado, where the village\r\nof Tandil had been established in 1823. In addition, a line of forts\r\nstretched from Blanca Grande in the south-west to Bahía Blanca. The\r\nexpedition sent in search of a port south of the mouth of the Plata\r\nhad not found any nearer site that was suitable. But Bahía Blanca was\r\nto remain an isolated advance post until 1880, sharply separated from\r\nboth the colonized zone of the Pampas and the establishments on the\r\nPatagonian coast.\r\n\r\nWhile the cultivated area was thus growing toward the south, it was\r\nbeing reduced in the north of the province of Buenos Aires and the\r\nsouth of Córdoba. The lands of the lower Rio Cuarto were not occupied.\r\nAbout 1860 (Martin de Moussy) the farthest establishments in this\r\nsector were S. José de la Esquina and Saladillo on the Tercero. The\r\nroad to Chile by the Rio Cuarto, Achiras, and San Luis was threatened.\r\nThe advance of colonization in this zone was at first in the west to\r\nVilla Mercedes on the Rio Quinto. The line of the Rio Cuarto by Carlota\r\nwas reoccupied, and before 1875 the frontier had been pushed back to\r\nthe Rio Quinto, where it joined the forts of southern Buenos Aires by\r\nway of Sarmiento, Gainza, and Lavalle.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1878, General Roca abandoned the classical methods\r\nof fighting the Indians, and took the offensive. He deprived the\r\nIndians of their refuges to the south of San Luis and the Central\r\nPampa, and threw them back toward the desert. The Argentine troops\r\nfollowed in their steps as far as the Andes and the Rio Negro. There\r\nare to-day few traces in the immense territory that was won of the\r\nindigenous population. Its extreme mobility had masked its numerical\r\ninferiority.[6]\r\n\r\n     [6] M. J. Olascoaga gives (_La conquête de la Pampa: Recueil\r\n     de documents relatifs à la campagne du Rio Negro_, Buenos\r\n     Aires, 1881) valuable documents concerning both the details\r\n     of the fight with the Indians and the distribution of their\r\n     _invernadas_ (common lands) in the region of the Pampas.\r\n     Olascoaga translates it \"winter quarters\"; it was pasturage on\r\n     which they kept their cattle and from which they set out on\r\n     their expeditions.\r\n\r\nThe history of the northern frontier is much the same. At the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century the Spanish outposts ran along the course of\r\nthe Salado. To the north of Santa Fé, at Sunchales, Soledad, and San\r\nJavier, they protected the direct route from Santa Fé to Santiago del\r\nEstero. These outposts were abandoned during the revolutionary period,\r\nand the Indians advanced as far as the suburbs of Santa Fé. The roads\r\nboth to Santiago and, by the Quebracho Herrado, to Córdoba were cut.[7]\r\nUrquiza reorganized the Santa Fé frontier, first as far as San Javier,\r\nthen below 29° S. lat. between Arroyo del Rey on the Paraná and Tostado\r\non the Salado. The expedition of 1884 brought the Argentine army as far\r\nas the Bermejo, and broke the resistance of the Tobas. The forts which,\r\nmore to the north, guarded the province of Salta, on the further side\r\nof the Sierras de la Lumbrera and Santa Barbara, had been dismantled at\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century, as the tribes in this part of\r\nthe Chaco were not hostile.[8]\r\n\r\n     [7] See Thomas J. Hutchinson, _Buenos Aires and Argentine\r\n     Gleanings_.\r\n\r\n     [8] See Geronimo de la Serna, \"Expedición militar al Chaco,\"\r\n     _Bol. I, Geog. Argentino_, xv. 1894, pp. 115-79.\r\n\r\nThe memory of the fights with the Indians is so completely blotted out\r\nto-day, and the menace of invasion by the tribes has been so rapidly\r\nextinguished, that it is difficult to realize fully the profound\r\ninfluence they once had on colonization. The line of forts was a frail\r\nbarrier that was constantly broken through. The Indians of the Pampa\r\nstole cattle from the ranches of Buenos Aires, and sold them in Chile.\r\nColonel Garcia calculates in 1816 that about 40,000 animals were stolen\r\nevery year.[9] Colonel Roca gives the same figure in 1876. The Pampa\r\nput no natural difficulties in the way of the movements of the Indians,\r\nno points which might serve as bases for the frontier. D. Pedro Pablo\r\nPabon points out that the proximity of the Sierra, instead of giving\r\nprotection to outposts in the Tandil region, would be an additional\r\nsource of insecurity, as it increased the difficulty of keeping watch.\r\nIn the north the Indian incursions followed the clearings in the scrub,\r\navoiding the dense and impenetrable parts. The lagoon of Mar Chiquita,\r\nto the west of Santa Fé, was a valuable rampart, in the shelter of\r\nwhich a fairly large population had established itself round Concepción\r\ndel Tio.\r\n\r\n     [9] _Nuevo plan de fronteras de la provincia de la Republica\r\n     Argentina_ (Coll. de Angelis, vol. vi).\r\n\r\nThe enlargements of the frontier were sometimes due to expansive\r\nmovements of colonization, the breeders occupying new land beyond the\r\nline of forts and demanding protection, and sometimes to the arbitrary\r\naction of a Government which was eager to extend its territory, though\r\nit was still without the means of exploiting it. Roca has well shown\r\nthe defects of this system of premature military occupation. \"To go\r\nfar away from the populated districts in acquiring new territory is,\r\nin my opinion, only an aggravation of the inconveniences of defensive\r\nwar, and it places a desert between the new lines and the settled\r\nregions.... Invasions occur at once.\"[10] We should therefore be\r\nlikely to make serious mistakes if we were to identify the history of\r\ncolonization with that of military occupation. Moreover, the garrisons\r\nof the forts did not take a very active part in the exploitation of\r\nthe soil. The plan which D'Azara proposed, of making _blandengues_\r\n(lancers) colonists and rooting them to the soil by distributing it\r\namongst them, seems to have been purely Utopian. His description of\r\nthe frontier shows clearly how slight a hold the early colonization\r\nhad on the Pampa, where the only relatively industrious element was\r\nrepresented by the groups of civilians (_paisanos_) who gathered about\r\nthe works and moats of the forts. It was different on the Santiago del\r\nEstero frontier, where there was agriculture as well as breeding. Here\r\nthe fort was identical with the village, and each soldier had his plot\r\nof wheat, maize, or water-melons.[11]\r\n\r\n     [10] Letter to the Minister of War, October 19, 1875.\r\n\r\n     [11] See the curious picture, which Hutchinson gives us, of\r\n     military life on the Rio Salado de Santiago about the middle\r\n     of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe provinces which were to combine in forming the Argentine Republic\r\nhad no economic unity. They were really two countries, two separate\r\nworlds, the coast regions and the mountain regions (_de arriba_),\r\njoined together, but not blended, by the main road from Buenos Aires\r\nto Peru, by way of Córdoba, Tucumán, and Salta. They represented two\r\ndifferent branches of Spanish colonization. \"Two human streams,\" says\r\nMitre, \"contributed to the peopling of the vice-royalty.... The first\r\ncame directly from Spain, the mother country. It occupied and peopled\r\nthe banks in the basin of the Rio de la Plata, in the name of the\r\nright of discovery and conquest, and fertilized them by its labour.\r\nThe other stream came from the ancient empire of the Incas, already\r\nsubdued by the Spanish armies. This spread toward the interior of the\r\ncountry as it passed from the Pacific to the Atlantic, occupied the\r\nland in virtue of the same rights, and exploited it by means of a\r\nfeudal system.... The same year, 1535, saw the foundation of the two\r\ntowns, Buenos Aires and Lima, and was the centre of these two cycles\r\nof discoveries and conquests. Thirty-eight years later, in the same\r\nyear, 1573, the Conquistadores who came from Peru founded the town of\r\nCórdoba, two hundred miles away from the Paraná, while those who came\r\nfrom the Rio de la Plata founded the town of Santa Fé on the banks of\r\nthat river.\"[12]\r\n\r\n     [12] Mitre, _Historia de Belgrano_, I, ch. i. pp. 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAP I.--ARGENTINA. THE NATURAL REGIONS.\r\n  _The map shows the distribution of the natural regions--the dry Andes\r\n  in the north-west, with irrigated cultivation; the monte, or brush,\r\n  which is still used for extensive breeding; and the Pampa, with its\r\n  great areas of cereals and lucerne. The line marking the frontier of\r\n  1875 shows the speed at which colonization has developed in the western\r\n  half of the plain of the Pampas.

The line of\r\ndemarcation between the two zones of colonization crosses the immense\r\ndesert plains of the interior, not the elevated tablelands of the Andes.\r\n\r\nThe two types of Argentinians differed in every respect, in blood as\r\nwell as in environment. The indigenous race, which was eliminated on\r\nthe coast, mingled intimately with the conquering race in the interior.\r\n\r\nThe establishments on the Rio de la Plata had originally been merely\r\nstages on the road to Peru, and had no value of themselves. The\r\nelevated tablelands of the Andes long remained the economic centre of\r\nSpanish America, and the provinces of the interior, which sold them\r\ncattle and mules, depended very closely upon them. The end of the\r\neighteenth century was marked by more rapid progress in the region of\r\nthe Pampas. The vice-royalty of La Plata was created.\r\n\r\nFreedom of trade was secured between Buenos Aires and the Spanish\r\nports. The export of hides increased. The influence of Buenos Aires\r\nspread over the interior and, in spite of the Córdoba tariff, reached\r\nthe regions of the north-west. \"The creation of the vice-royalty,\" says\r\nDean Funes, \"and the new direction taken by commerce had the effect\r\nthat Buenos Aires became the centre of considerable and important\r\nbusiness.\"[13]\r\n\r\n     [13] D. Gregorio Funes, _Ensayo de la historia civil del\r\n     Paraguay, Buenos Aires, y Tucumán_ (Buenos Aires, 3 vols.,\r\n     1816).\r\n\r\nThis commercial development, which seemed destined to bring closer\r\ntogether the two halves of Argentinian territory, was interrupted\r\nin the first half of the nineteenth century. This did not, however,\r\nbreak the connections between the provinces to the north-west of the\r\ntableland and those on the Pacific slope, and indeed, they became\r\nmore varied and more binding. Packs of mules, carrying the ore of San\r\nJuan and La Rioja to the foundries of the Chilean side, added life to\r\nthe Cordillera. When Chile, transformed into an agricultural country,\r\ncould not meet its own demand for cattle, the oases of the Argentine\r\nside were sown with lucerne for fattening the cattle which were to\r\ncross the mountains. The provinces of Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja,\r\nCatamarca, Tucumán, and Salta were held within the orbit of the Andes\r\ndistricts.[14] There are historical reasons for this set-back to the\r\ninfluence of Buenos Aires. The wars of the revolutionary period and\r\nthe conflicts between the Buenos Aires Government and the maritime\r\npowers checked the commercial enterprise on the banks of the Plata.\r\nThis political isolation of the province of Buenos Aires, under the\r\nRosas Government, lasted until 1853. Poncel gives us statistics of the\r\nimports of Catamarca which show the great importance of this date in\r\nthe history of Argentine commerce:\r\n\r\n     [14] The Woodbine Parish map (1839) puts Tinogasta eighty\r\n     miles out of its proper position, at the very foot of the Come\r\n     Caballos range, thus reducing by one half its distance from\r\n     Copiapo, on the Chilean slope.\r\n\r\n  Imports into the Province of       1850  1851  1852  1853  1854\r\n  Catamarca:\r\n\r\n  From the Pacific across the\r\n  Cordillera (in millions of           72    50    71    40    12\r\n  piastres)\r\n\r\n  From the Atlantic (Buenos Aires\r\n  or Rosario)                          11     7    20    64   116[15]\r\n\r\n     [15] B. Poncel, _Mes itinéraires dans les Provinces du Rio de\r\n     la Plata, Province de Catamarca_ (Paris, 1864).\r\n\r\nIn 1854-5 the Cordillera route definitely ceased to be of commercial\r\nimportance to Catamarca, and it was afterwards used merely for the\r\nexport of cattle.\r\n\r\nBut the attraction of Buenos Aires after 1853 was not merely due to its\r\ncommercial life and its intermediate position between the provinces\r\nof the interior and Europe. It was chiefly based upon the economic\r\ndevelopment of the region of the Pampas, which began about this date,\r\nand altered the balance between the two halves of Argentina. The\r\nexploitation of the Pampa, the improvement in breeding methods, and the\r\nintroduction and expansion of agriculture on the plain of the Pampa,\r\nwhich fill all publications on modern Argentina, are in themselves one\r\nof the great events in the economic history of the nineteenth century.\r\nThey had also an indirect but profound influence upon the life of other\r\nparts of Argentina. The consuming capacity of the Pampa increased\r\nsimultaneously with its wealth and population. It absorbed the products\r\nof the neighbouring provinces and in turn made customers of them,\r\ndistributing amongst them, according to the services they rendered,\r\npart of the gold it obtained from beyond the Atlantic. One after the\r\nother the provinces lost the relations which had hitherto connected\r\nthem with foreign lands. There was the same development all over the\r\nzone of cereals and lucerne--the direction of the stream of commerce\r\nwas reversed. In some places, as at Tucumán and Mendoza the change\r\nwas accomplished a generation ago. In other places, as at Salta and\r\nSan Juan, it is still going on. In yet other places, the more remote\r\nvalleys, like Jachal and Santa Maria, it will occur in the near future.\r\nBy a singular anomaly the Far West of North America, which sprang up\r\nhalf a century ago, tends to withdraw more and more from the influence\r\nof the eastern States, which provided it with capital and immigrants,\r\nwhile the Far West of Argentina, which is just as old as the east and\r\nby no means a creation of the east, since it developed in isolation and\r\nfreedom, and was already adult and rich when they came into contact,\r\nhas nevertheless fallen into complete dependence upon the east in the\r\ncourse of a few years.\r\n\r\nThe life of the whole country depended upon the great colonization\r\nmovement which transformed the plain of the Pampas. This brought about\r\nan economic unity which was at once reflected in the political world.\r\nThe railway from Buenos Aires reached Tucumán before 1880; Mendoza, San\r\nJuan, Salta, and Catamarca before 1890; and La Rioja before 1900. The\r\nestablishment of closer economic relations between the coast and the\r\nprovinces of the interior has nearly always inaugurated a period of\r\ngreat prosperity for the latter. In every case the influence of Buenos\r\nAires vitalized them, put an end to their slumbers, and made them rich.\r\n\r\nNot only did the coast take for itself the products of the western\r\nprovinces, which had hitherto found their way to other markets, but new\r\ncentres of production had to be created to meet its needs. The forests\r\nof the Chaco received a great influx of wood-cutters, to provide the\r\nsleepers for the railways. The valley of the Rio Negro was planted with\r\nvines, to provide the wines of the colonies in the district of Bahía\r\nBlanca. The attraction of the Pampa was felt as far as the frontiers.\r\nParaguay competed with Corrientes in the supply of tobacco and oranges;\r\nwith Misiones in the supply of _yerba maté_. Each district chose the\r\nparticular crop which was best suited to its climate, in order to\r\nsecure the highest possible advantage from its relations with Buenos\r\nAires.\r\n\r\nThe two most brilliant satellites of the Pampa, the most important\r\nproductive centres of the interior, are Tucumán and Mendoza. All the\r\nother important towns of Argentina belong themselves to the region of\r\nthe Pampas. Tucumán and Mendoza, which live by supplying the Pampa with\r\nsugar and wine, have become in turn secondary centres of attraction.\r\nThey are a sort of regional capitals, and they have their own spheres\r\nof economic influence. A network of commercial streams has developed\r\nabout them, and this has led to the formation of new roads. These lines\r\nof local interest are easily recognized on a map of the railways,\r\nwhere one sees them superimposed upon the regular fan of lines which\r\nconverges toward Buenos Aires. La Rioja provides the props for the\r\nvines of San Juan and Mendoza. From the north of Córdoba to Salta,\r\na distance of about 250 miles, the wood is cut for the fuel of the\r\nsugar-works of Tucumán. Santiago dries the fodder for its troops of\r\nmules. The prairies of Catamarca, which once fattened the cattle that\r\nwere intended for Chile, and often came even from Tucumán, now sell\r\ntheir beasts to the butchers of Tucumán. The wines of San Juan find\r\ntheir best customers at Tucumán. Even the nearest portions of the plain\r\nof the Pampas, to the north-east of Santa Fé and the south of San Luis,\r\nsupply maize and wheat to Tucumán and Mendoza, instead of sending them\r\nto the ports for export.\r\n\r\nWhile Argentina lives on the Pampa, the Pampa lives on export. It has\r\nbeen developed through the inflow of European immigrants, and Europe\r\npays by sending its manufactured products and capital. Except as\r\nregards emigration, the United States had, before the war, much the\r\nsame relation to Argentina as the countries of Western Europe. Thus\r\nthe economic prosperity of the Republic binds it more and more closely\r\nto the life of the whole world. Its position in the temperate zone of\r\nSouth America had retarded its entrance into world-commerce, and this\r\nexplains the slowness with which its colonization proceeded at first.\r\nIts climate and products were too similar to those of Spain. Not only\r\nthe mining and metallurgical centres of the Andes and of Mantiqueria,\r\nbut even the sugar and cotton regions of Brazil, the Antilles, and the\r\nGuianas, were developed before the plains of the Pampas.\r\n\r\nThe turn of the Argentine Republic did not come until the growth of\r\npopulation in the industrial countries of Europe made them dependent\r\nupon foreign lands for their food, and until the application of steam\r\nto ships made it possible to export wool, meat, and cereals on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the economic organization of Argentina with that of the\r\nUnited States, we see that it is both less complex and less capable of\r\nbeing self-contained. The difference is due to the architecture of the\r\ncountry. I said at the beginning of this chapter that Argentina has no\r\nequivalent for the zone of the Atlantic tablelands, which is now the\r\ngreat industrial region of North America. The industrial prosperity of\r\neastern North America provides a safe home market for the farmers of\r\nthe west, and relieves them of the need of exporting their produce.\r\nMoreover, the Atlantic tablelands, the original centres of population,\r\nwhere the first generations of colonists lived on land that was often\r\npoor, have seen the gradual formation of reserves of labour and capital\r\nwhich were afterwards used in colonizing the west. The east sifted, in\r\na sense controlled, the influence of modern Europe in the colonization\r\nof the United States. It classified and assimilated the new emigrants\r\nwho set out for the west, mingled with the troops of native pioneers\r\non their way to the prairies. In the same way, when European capital\r\nflowed into the United States, it found in the eastern cities a large\r\ntreasury and a body of financiers in whose hands it had to remain.\r\n\r\nIn Argentina, on the contrary, everything speaks of the close and\r\ndirect dependence of the country upon oversea markets. The soil itself\r\nbears the marks of this solidarity. It is seen in the network of the\r\nrailways, the concentration of the urban population in the ports, and\r\nthe distribution of the cultivated districts in concentric circles\r\nwhich are often limited, not by a physical obstacle, but by the cost of\r\nfreightage between the productive centre and the port. Thus we get a\r\ngeographical expression of facts which seem at first sight to belong to\r\nthe purely economic or sociological order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE OASES OF THE NORTH-WEST AND PASTORAL LIFE IN THE SCRUB\r\n\r\n     The inhabited zones of the Andes in the north-west--_Valles_,\r\n     _Quebradas_, _Puna_--The irrigation of the _valles_--The\r\n     historic routes--Convoys of stock--The breeding of mules and\r\n     the fairs--The struggle of the breeders against drought--The\r\n     Sierra de los Llanos.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole life and wealth of the arid provinces of north-western\r\nArgentina depend upon irrigation; the water-supply definitively settles\r\nthe sites of human establishments. The water resources are irregularly\r\ndistributed. They are especially abundant in the south (San Juan,\r\nMendoza, and San Rafael), where the torrents of the Cordillera are fed\r\nby the glaciers, and on the outer fringe of the hills above the Chaco,\r\nat the foot of Aconcagua, which gathers masses of cloud and rain on its\r\nflanks (Tucumán). In the intermediate district, on the contrary, in the\r\nregions of La Rioja and Catamarca, and in the interior of the hilly\r\nzone to the north-west of Tucumán, the amount of available water is\r\nsmall; the oases shrink into small spots far removed from each other.\r\n\r\nThis natural inequality was not felt at first. For a long time the\r\nspread of cultivation and the progress of wealth were restricted only\r\nby the scarcity of population, the difficulties of transport, and the\r\ninadequacy of the markets. The best endowed oases paid no attention\r\nto the surplus supply of water, for which they had no use. We have to\r\ncome down to the close of the nineteenth century to find men reaching\r\nthe limits which nature has set to colonization, and mapping out\r\ntheir domain. It is not until then that La Rioja ceases to compete\r\nwith Mendoza, or Catamarca with Tucumán. While large industrial\r\nenterprises develop at Mendoza and Tucumán, strong centres of urban\r\nlife arise, the population increases, and immigrants stream in, the\r\noases of the interior scarcely change. Their population does not keep\r\nits level. Life has an archaic character that one finds nowhere else\r\nin Argentina. The physical conditions have retarded, one would almost\r\nsay crystallized, the economic development. The living generation\r\nexploits the soil in ways that to some extent go back as far as the\r\nindigenous tribes, the masters of their Spanish conquerors in the art\r\nof irrigation. The industry of fattening and convoying cattle, which\r\nwas once the chief source of wealth of the whole country, is still\r\nalive in those districts.\r\n\r\nThe zone of the elevated tablelands of the Andes without drainage\r\ntoward the sea--the Puna--has still, below 22° S. latitude on the\r\nnorthern frontier of Argentina, a width of about 250 miles. This\r\nbreadth steadily contracts southward as far as 28° S. latitude, where\r\nthe Puna ends about the level of the road from Tinogasta to Copiapo.\r\n\r\nTo the east and south of the Puna the Argentine Andes are cut from\r\nnorth to south by a series of long gullies and large basins, between\r\nwhich there are lofty and massive chains with steep flanks. Some of\r\nthese lie in the heart of the mountains, while others often open like\r\ngulfs upon the edge of the plain. These depressions with rectilinear\r\ncontours are a common feature of the topography of the Andes in this\r\nlatitude. The central plain of Chile is closely related to them.\r\nIn the Argentine speech they are called _valles_: Valle de Lerma,\r\nValle Calchaqui, Valle de Iglesias, de Calingasta, d'Uspallata. They\r\nare, however, not \"valleys\" in the sense of hollows made by erosion\r\nby running water. They owe their formation to tectonic movements,\r\nsubsidences of the surface. The scanty rivers of the arid Anacs are not\r\ncapable of doing work of that kind. When they enter the already formed\r\nbed of a _valle_, they seem to be lost in the immense space. Often\r\nthey dry up in it, leaving behind the sediment and salts with which\r\nthe water was laden. In other places they cut at right angles across\r\nthe _valle_, escaping by narrow breaches in it, while the depression\r\ncontinues its course on either side, taking in sections of a number of\r\nindependent streams.\r\n\r\nOpposed to the _valle_ is the eroded ravine, carved out by water, the\r\n_quebrada_. It opens upon a _valle_ with a V-shaped mouth, which widens\r\nout at the top, and one can recognise at sight the various slopes and\r\nthe successive stages of erosion. Narrow and winding, a level bed\r\nof shingle filling the entire base of the valley, it rises rapidly\r\ntoward the mountains and provides a route from the _valle_ to the\r\n_puna_. These _valles_, _quebradas_ and _puna_ are the three inhabited\r\nzones of the Andes. The first is the richest. The inhabitant of the\r\n_valle_, proud of his comparative comfort, has for his neighbour in the\r\n_quebrada_ or the _puna_--the _coyada_--a contempt such as one finds\r\nthe inhabitants of the good land in Europe feeling for the people in\r\npoorer districts.\r\n\r\nThe narrower the _valle_, the less rain there is. The observations\r\ngive 112 millimetres of rain per year at Tinogasta, 290 at Andalgala,\r\nand 200 at Santa Maria. Salta and Jujuy have a much moister climate,\r\nand have no less than 570 and 740 millimetres of rain annually. This\r\nis because the eastern chain of the Andes, which stretches from the\r\nSierra de Santa Victoria on the Bolivian frontier to Aconcagua, sinks\r\nlower at the latitude of Salta, and lets in the moisture of the Chaco\r\nto the heart of the zone of the Andes. The rains of Salta and Jujuy are\r\nsuspended during the winter, but they are so heavy during the summer\r\nmonths (November to March) that maize, which needs only the summer\r\nrain, can be cultivated without irrigation. But when we follow the\r\nValle de Lerma southward from Salta the maize harvest becomes more and\r\nmore uncertain, and it is no longer sown in dry soil when we get to\r\nabout twenty miles from Salta, in the latitude of the confluence of the\r\nArias and the Juramento. However, the summer rains, which are good for\r\nmaize, are very injurious to the vine; they spoil the grapes. Thus the\r\nsouthern limit of the cultivation of maize in dry soil almost coincides\r\nwith the northern limit of the vine. At that point we have the real\r\nbeginning of the typical scenery of the _valles_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PATAGONIAN ANDES. _Mount Tronador (11,500 feet) on\r\nthe Chilean frontier, dominating the road from Lake Nahuel Huapi to\r\nChile. The glaciers still reach the bottom of the valley, which they\r\nfilled at one time. A burnt forest in the foreground._ PLATE III. To\r\nface p. 38.]\r\n\r\nThe need of irrigation is due to the scarcity of rain, but it is\r\naccentuated by a number of causes which tend to increase the aridity.\r\nThe _valles_ are the scene of scorching day-winds, the _zonda_, like\r\nthe _Föhn_ of the Swiss Alps, which, there being no snow, dry up\r\nthe water of the springs and of the irrigation trenches, or use the\r\ndeposits left by the waters to form dunes, which they push southward,\r\nsometimes like veritable glaciers of sand. Moreover, the soil of\r\nthe _valles_ is generally composed of coarse and permeable alluvial\r\ndeposits, which absorb the rain-storms immediately. There is at the\r\nfoot of both sides of the hills which enclose each _valle_ an immense\r\nand far-lying bed of imperfectly rounded shingle. This double zone of\r\ndetritus is strangely desolate, for the vegetation on it is restricted\r\nto isolated bushes of _jarilla_ and _tola_. From the sheepfolds on the\r\nmountains to the oases in the valleys one hardly meets a single house.\r\nThe bed of the valley is not so desolate. A broad ribbon of sand marks\r\nthe dry bed of a torrent, and on the clays of its banks, if the sheet\r\nof water underground is not too deep, one finds, in spite of the goats\r\nand asses and charcoal-burners, little forests of _algarrobas_, which\r\nthe foundries use for fuel.\r\n\r\nThe modern alluvial beds, gravel and sand, represent the upper stratum\r\nof a considerable series of continental deposits which lie on the\r\nPaleozoic crystalline rock of the Andes.[16] They chiefly consist of\r\nred sandstone and coloured marls, which crop up here and there through\r\nthe alluvial covering and give the landscape a rugged character, worn\r\nby water and wind. There is no trace of humus: nothing to soften the\r\nvivid colours of the rock. Bodenbender, to whom we owe the first\r\ngeneral attempt to classify the series, points out the importance of\r\ndistinguishing the different strata in connection with the question\r\nof water supply and the conditions of human life.[17] A complete\r\ngeographical study would have to follow the geological description in\r\ndetail. In places--on the eastern edge of the Sierra de los Llanos--the\r\nfine modern clays are in contact with the granites of the hills and\r\nform above them a thick bed that is rich in fresh water. In other\r\nplaces--south-westward of the Sierra de la Famatina, as far as the\r\nBermejo--the outcrop is of red sandstone only. The tablelands of\r\nTalampaya and Ischigualasta, which are cut across by the gorges of the\r\ntributaries of the Bermejo, form one of the most conspicuously desert\r\nregions in the whole Republic. Wherever the gypsiferous marls of the\r\nCalchaqui are near the surface, the springs are saline. The undulations\r\nof the impermeable rocky substratum bring to light the water that\r\ngathers in the alluvial beds. Thus the streams which come down the\r\nFamatina range in the west disappear in the alluvial beds on the fringe\r\nof the Sierra, but re-appear presently in the oasis of Pagancillo.\r\n\r\n     [16] This series, stretching from the Permian to the Tertiary,\r\n     also includes, especially in the region of the sub-Andean\r\n     chains, on the fringe of the Chaco, a number of marine strata\r\n     (see Bonarelli, _Las sierras subandinas del Alto y Aguaragüe y\r\n     los yacimientos petroliferos del distrito minero de Tartagal_\r\n     \"Ann. Min. Agric.,\" Seccion Geologia, Mineralogia, y Mineria,\r\n     viii. No. 4: Buenos Aires, 1913).\r\n\r\n     [17] G. Bodenbender, _Parte meridional de la Provincia de la\r\n     Rioja y regiones limitrofes_ (Ann. Min. Agric., Seccion Geol.,\r\n     Minerol., y Mineria, vii. No. 3: Buenos Aires, 1912).\r\n\r\nHence the _valles_ are by no means wholly productive. The oases\r\nrepresent only a limited portion of them. It would be impossible to\r\nimagine a more striking contrast than that of the freshness and life\r\nof the oases compared with the surrounding desert. Screens of poplars\r\nshelter them from the _zonda_. The water runs along trenches paved\r\nwith round pebbles under the spreading vines, at the foot of which, to\r\neconomize water and space, lucerne is sown. Each garden feeds a family.\r\nNear the raw-brick houses there are large earthenware vessels, as tall\r\nas a man, in which the corn is kept. The hammering of the cooper fills\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nIn places the oasis is watered by a stream. In those cases there is\r\non each side of the bed of the stream a narrow fringe, a continuous\r\nribbon, of smiling gardens, which hide the path. Above and below Santa\r\nMaria a trench is opened every mile in the wet sands of the Rio. The\r\nwater rises in it and fills it, and is directed by it toward one of the\r\nbanks, where it is jealously collected and distributed. The water which\r\nflows from the irrigated fields and returns to the river, as well as\r\nthat which the porous side of the trench has permitted to escape, goes\r\nto fill another trench and supply other fields farther on. The region\r\nof Los Sauces, in the northern part of the province of La Rioja, to the\r\nsouth of Tinogasta, shows a different type of irrigated cultivation,\r\non account of the sandy course of the stream. The fields follow the\r\nfeeding artery for about fifty miles. It is bled at the beginning of\r\neach bend, the waters remaining underground like hidden wealth.\r\n\r\nIn most cases however, the _valle_ has no running water. What\r\nreaches it from the lateral _quebradas_ is lost in the alluvial beds\r\naccumulated at the point where the _quebrada_ enters the _valle_. In\r\norder to make use of it the cultivated areas are grouped on the cone of\r\ndeposition; at least, that is the position in the great majority of the\r\noases. A _costa_ is a line of separate oases with their backs to the\r\nsame slope. When the _valle_ is narrow, the _costas_ on either side of\r\nthe sterile depression face each other, like two parallel roads. The\r\nwater of the _quebrada_ is never sufficiently abundant to irrigate the\r\nwhole of the cone of the torrent. In order to create an oasis there,\r\nthey have selected the most easily cultivable zone, which is usually\r\nthe foot of the cone, where the deposits are finer and more fertile,\r\nretain the moisture better, and require less watering. The summit of\r\nthe cone is composed of coarse stones, the first to be dropped by the\r\ntorrent as it loses its strength. These are bad lands, where the water\r\nis wasted.\r\n\r\nTo meet the occasional drought and the danger of sudden floods in\r\nthis fluvial zone, which is entirely the domain of the torrent, there\r\nis need of constant care and ingenuity. At Colalao del Valle the\r\ncultivated fields are five or six miles from the summit of the cone.\r\nAfter a number of successive years of drought the stream of water\r\nwhich reached them on the flanks of the cone lost half its volume and\r\nthreatened to disappear altogether. They then built a stone dam at the\r\noutlet of the _quebrada_, and the water accumulates behind this during\r\nthe night. At three o'clock in the morning the sluices are opened, and\r\nthe stream, having thus nursed its strength, reaches the fields down\r\nbelow about seven o'clock. Then the sun and the wind rise, just at the\r\ntime when the reservoir is empty, and by the middle of the day the\r\nstream ceases, and irrigation is suspended. At Andalgala, above which\r\nrises the glittering crest of Aconcagua, the waters of the melting\r\nsnows which feed the torrent have not time to be \"decanted\" before they\r\nreach the valley. They come down laden with mud and sand. Above the\r\npoints where the irrigation-channels begin the people make, in the bed\r\nof the torrent, a dam of branches of trees which filters the water. It\r\nis swept away by every flood that occurs, and is at once restored.\r\n\r\nWhat is even more admirable than the ingenuity of the _vallista_\r\nin utilizing the natural resources is the minute detail of the\r\nwater-rights. It seems as if the _vallista_ is even more cunning in\r\nprotecting himself from his neighbour than in dealing with nature. The\r\nwater-customs of these Andean valleys are worth an extensive study.\r\nThe water does not belong to the State, and is not used by concession\r\nfrom the State. It is private property. The owner uses or abuses it as\r\nhe pleases on the lands which he has selected. A man may be poor in\r\nland and rich in water, which he accordingly sells. There are frequent\r\nbusiness deals in regard to water-rights, just as in regard to the soil\r\nand its produce. Appropriation of water often precedes appropriation\r\nof the soil. Many oases are communities where the non-irrigated lands\r\nare common to the whole population, and the irrigated fields alone are\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nA primary group of customs regulates the relations to each other of\r\ncommunities higher up and lower down the same stream. At Catamarca the\r\nwater of a certain stream is shared by Piedra Blanca and Valle Viejo.\r\nPiedra Blanca, in the upper part, absorbs the whole of the water for a\r\nweek, but it must then suspend its irrigation during the following week\r\nand permit the stream to flow down the valley. The same evening, or the\r\nnext morning, according to the season, the water reaches Valle Viejo.\r\nIt is a custom known as the _quiebras_ in the southern valleys of the\r\ndesert side of Peru, where it allows different stages of cultivation\r\nto proceed simultaneously. In the same way, above Santa Maria, where\r\nseveral communities (S. José, Loro Huasi, etc.) receive the water\r\nbrought by a channel from the Rio Santa Maria, each of them has a\r\nright to the full output of the channel for three days. At the end of\r\nthat time the sluices are closed, and the water passes to the next\r\ncommunity. There is grave trouble for any oasis that has its rights\r\ninfringed or does not compel the communities higher up to respect them.\r\n\r\nAmongst individuals the water-right is generally defined by a\r\nmeasurement of time, a certain number of days or hours--during which\r\nthe owner controls the entire flow of the spring or stream. It is\r\nonly when the water is more abundant that we find another method of\r\nfixing the right of water, defining it by bulk. The water is then said\r\nto be _demarcada_, as the unit is customarily the _marco_, or the\r\nvolume which passes through an opening about twenty-one centimetres\r\nin width and eight in height. The _marco_ has infinite divisions, and\r\neach subdivision has its own name--the _naranja_, the _bombilla_, the\r\n_paja_, and so on.\r\n\r\nAs all the water is utilized, and the rights of all are equally\r\nentitled to respect, the division of the water into _marcos_\r\n(_demarcacion_) is in practice merely a proportional distribution of\r\nit amongst those who have rights to it. If the sum total of rights\r\nexpressed in _marcos_ represents something like the total flow of\r\na stream during an average season, in the time of low water it is\r\ndisproportionate, and the water no longer flows to the tops of the\r\n_marcos_. In other words, the quantity of water granted to each rises\r\nor falls with the rise or fall of the stream itself.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, when the water-right is defined in _marcos_ it is\r\npermanent. Often, however, it is impossible to grant each proprietor\r\na permanent title to the water. Even in oases where the water is\r\n\"demarked,\" the _turno_--that is to say, the turn of the proprietors to\r\nhave water--which is the absolute rule in the poorest oases, reappears\r\nduring the months of scarcity, in winter, when there is no rain,\r\nand at the beginning of summer. It reappears also when the right of\r\nownership has been broken up into fractions that are too small, and it\r\nis better to grant a larger volume of water for several hours instead\r\nof a constant stream of water which would be too scanty for profitable\r\nuse. At Andalgala the \"turn\" is sometimes obligatory, and regulated by\r\ncustom, in channels where the irrigating proprietors are too numerous;\r\nat other times optional, and settled by convention amongst the owners\r\nthemselves, when water is scanty. At Valle Viejo (Catamarca), when\r\nthe water runs low, they set up the _mita_; that is to say, the\r\nsluices remain closed in each channel during four days out of eight,\r\neach proprietor in turn giving up his right to a permanent supply in\r\norder to have a double allowance when his turn comes. The _turno_ is,\r\ntherefore, a general practice. Everywhere we can see the farmers on\r\nthe watch along the _acequias_, waiting for the moment to close their\r\nneighbour's trench with a pellet of clay and to let the stream into\r\ntheir own trenches with a blow of the spade.\r\n\r\nThe most minute precautions are taken in order that no one shall suffer\r\ninjury. As the irrigation is always slower and less thorough during the\r\nnight, they take it in turns to have the day and the night alternately.\r\nWhen the community receives the water from another community higher up\r\nthe stream, the succession of \"turns\" amongst its members differs every\r\ntime. The water comes down charged with sediment, pushing in front of\r\nit a mass of liquid mud, as the flush of a torrent does. It takes some\r\ntime for the stream to become regular and clear. The first irrigator\r\ntherefore exercises his right under unfavourable conditions. In the\r\nlocal phraseology the _volcada de agua_ is not as good as the _corte\r\nde agua_, which means the irrigation that begins when the _acequia_ is\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nIrrigation entails the services of quite a staff of arbitrators and\r\nadministrators. The head men, who have jurisdiction of a higher order\r\nand secure the accurate distribution of the water amongst a number\r\nof channels or communities, are now, as a rule, officials of the\r\nadministration, appointed by the provincial authorities (_juez de\r\nIrrigacion_ at Catamarca, _juez de rio_ at Rosario de Lerma). But the\r\n_juez de agua_ of each community or each channel is a syndic elected by\r\nthe interested parties. At Santa Maria the _juez de agua_ is elected\r\nby the owners and confirmed by the Government. He controls irrigation\r\nthroughout the department, settling all differences, submitting plans\r\nof work to a meeting of the owners, and assigning their respective\r\ncharges in labour and contributions according to their rights.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis land of customs and traditions is also a land of lively movement.\r\nThe briskness of the traffic is primarily due to continuous exchange\r\nbetween the various zones of the mountainous district. This large\r\ntrade, so scattered that the railways could not dream of satisfying\r\nits needs, is carried, in the old fashion, on the backs of mules. The\r\nlively aspect of the roads between the tableland and the lower valleys\r\nof the region, the brisk interchange of goods between zones with\r\ndifferent climates, is one of the common features of life on the Andes.\r\n\r\nBut the classic spectacle presents a different aspect in different\r\nlatitudes. In Peru, and in southern Bolivia, the higher valleys--Jauja,\r\nCuzco, the Pampas of Cochabamba and Sucre--have centres of dense\r\npopulation and agricultural wealth at a height of between 9,000\r\nand 11,000 feet. They raise cereals, and receive from the tropical\r\ndistricts (_montañas and yungas_) sugar, cane-brandy, cocoa, and\r\ncoca-leaf. The valleys of the Argentine Andes are usually at a less\r\nelevation than the _yungas_ and _montañas_ of Bolivia and Peru. But\r\nthey are not hot districts, and have not tropical vegetation. Frost\r\nprevents the harvesting of sugar-cane at Salta, at a height of 4,000\r\nfeet. As to the coca-leaf, which is not as much used here as in the\r\nnorth, the Argentine _valles_ do not send it to the tableland, but\r\nreceive it indirectly from there, through the southern _yungas_. In\r\ndefault of tropical crops, the Argentine _valles_ sow wheat and maize,\r\nwhich they sell to the Indians of the cold districts of the Puna for\r\nwool and salt.\r\n\r\nThese commercial currents are of very ancient, probably pre-Columbian\r\norigin. Boman has discovered ears of maize in the prehistoric tombs\r\nof the Puna de Atacama.[18] The Puna, at a height of 11,000 to 12,000\r\nfeet, is permanently inhabited, unlike the high valleys of the\r\nCordillera de San Juan, which are occupied only during the summer\r\nseason by Chilean shepherds. It is primarily a pastoral and mining\r\nregion, but it has some tilled land, at more than 6,700 feet above the\r\nlevel of the valleys. The higher limit of annual cultivation in the\r\ncold districts, which is fixed by the summer temperature, does not fall\r\nin the same way as that of arboriculture in warm districts, because\r\ntrees suffer from the winter frosts. The Indians of Cochinoca and\r\nSusques sow lucerne and barley for fodder, and the _quinoa_ and potato\r\nfor food. Transport between the Puna and the _valles_ is carried on\r\nby the inhabitants of the Puna, and is not shared by the _vallistas_.\r\nThey are especially active in the north, in the province of Jujuy.\r\nBelmar shows how important the sales of the Puna woollen goods were by\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century.[19] These fabrics were used by\r\nthe mill-owners of the Rio Grande de Jujuy to pay for the work of the\r\nIndians of the Chaco, whom they employed in the sugar-cane harvest.\r\nThe competition of the manufactured products of Europe now menaces the\r\ndomestic weaving of the Puna, just as the competition of the flour of\r\nthe Pampa menaces the cultivation of cereals in the _valles_.\r\n\r\n     [18] Eric Boman, _Antiquités de la région andine de la\r\n     République Argentine et de la Puna de Atacama: Mission scient.\r\n     G. de Créqui-Montfort et E. Sénéchal de la Grange_ (Paris,\r\n     vols. i. and ii. 1908).\r\n\r\n     [19] Belmar, _Les provinces de la Fédération argentine_\r\n     (Paris, 1856).\r\n\r\nBesides this traffic of local interest the _valles_ serve for a traffic\r\nof a higher, almost a continental character. It seems certain that\r\nduring the pre-Spanish period the road from the Peruvian tablelands to\r\nChile avoided the inhospitable desert of the Puna de Atacama, entered\r\nthe region of the _valles_ to the east, and crossed the Cordillera in\r\nthe latitude of Tinogasta, or even a little further south. That was\r\nthe route of the armies of the Incas, which in the fourteenth century\r\ncame as far as Maule. The pre-Columbian roads, of which Boman has\r\nfound traces between the Valle de Lerma and the Valle Calchaqui, seem\r\nto correspond with this direction of traffic. By this route the long\r\n_quechua_ passed amongst the Diaguites populations. The conquerors\r\nfollowed the Indian guides. Almagro, in going from Peru to Chile,\r\npassed through the _valles_ at the eastern edge of the Andes.\r\n\r\nLater the _valles_ were incorporated in the many variations of the\r\nhistoric high road, one of the first and busiest of Spanish America,\r\nwhich goes from the Rio de la Plata to Lima: a route both for armies\r\nand merchants. The plan proposed by Matienzo (1566) to make a road\r\nfrom the silver mines to the estuary of the Paraná, through the Valle\r\nde Calchaqui, seems to have been intended merely to improve a line of\r\ncommunication that had already been in use. Buenos Aires for a long\r\ntime received European goods by this road. About 1880 the Salta route\r\nrecovered for a time its continental importance, during the Pacific\r\nWar and the occupation by the Chileans of the maritime provinces of\r\nBolivia.[20] At that time it was the only outlet for Bolivia.\r\n\r\n     [20] See Brackebusch, \"Viaje a la provincia de Jujuy,\" _Bol.\r\n     Instit.

To face p. 48.]\r\n\r\nBut of all the forms of traffic that have enlivened the _valles_ the\r\nmost constant, and the form that has had the most profound influence on\r\ntheir existence, is the movement of cattle. The cattle trade has been\r\nof fundamental importance in the history of the colonization of South\r\nAmerica. Animals were the only goods that could be conveyed any great\r\ndistance. At the beginning of the conquest the productive regions of\r\nthe continent, which supplied the export trade with Europe, were very\r\nlimited in extent. Pastoral colonization began at once, and spread\r\nover a very wide area. Herds of oxen, for meat or draught, horses, and\r\nmules, made their way toward the centres of consumption: towns like\r\nLima, Bahía, and Rio, the Peruvian mines, and the sugar-refineries of\r\nthe north-east of Brazil, and later toward the _yerbales_ of Paraguay\r\nor the seaports of the Caribs and the Rio Grande do Sul, where the\r\njerked meat industry developed. The cattle routes converge upon these\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\nThe export of cattle and mules from the Argentine plains to Peru was\r\nfully established by the close of the sixteenth century, and it seems\r\nto have continued without interruption ever since. Upper Peru is,\r\nhowever, not the only market on which the Argentine breeders lived. At\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century D'Azara demanded that they should\r\npermit the sale of horses and mules to Brazil, for use in the mines.\r\nThe cattle traffic with Portuguese territory had not then assumed\r\nthe form of a regular commerce, and the Brazilians made raids on the\r\nnorth-eastern provinces for the animals they needed--60,000 a year,\r\nD'Azara says.[21] The export of cattle to Paraguay and Misiones was, on\r\nthe other hand, of substantial economic importance in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Before the Revolution, Rengger says, as many as 200,000 head\r\nof cattle passed yearly from Corrientes to Paraguay, which paid for\r\nthem in _maté_ and tobacco.[22] This trade was kept up intermittently\r\nin the nineteenth century. The exports from Corrientes were especially\r\nimportant at the time when the Paraguay stock was reconstituted after\r\nthe war (40,000 head of cattle in 1875).\r\n\r\n     [21] _Memorias sobre el estado rural del rio de la Plata en\r\n     1801, Escritos postumos de D. Felix de Azara_, published by D.\r\n     Augustin de Azara (Madrid, 1847).\r\n\r\n     [22] A. Rengger, _Reise nach Paraguay in den Jahren 1818 bis\r\n     1826_ (Aarau, 1835).\r\n\r\nFinally, the Chilean market was opened to the Argentine breeders about\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century. In the time of Martin de Moussy\r\nthe convoys of cattle to Chile were so numerous that the lucerne fields\r\nof both slopes were stripped bare at the very beginning of the season;\r\nand they were rented at a high price.[23] Not only the mining provinces\r\nof the north, but central Chile also, bought Argentine cattle. The\r\nopening of the Chilean market was followed by a remarkable expansive\r\nmovement in the pastoral colonization of Argentine territory. We can\r\nfollow the progress of this not only in Martin de Moussy's book, but in\r\nall contemporary works of travel. Its chief theatres are the provinces\r\nof San Luis and of Santiago del Estero, north of the Rio Dulce, where\r\nHutchinson, in particular, describes the activity of the ranches.[24]\r\nFinally, after the Pacific War (1880) the nitrate district, taken from\r\nBolivia and Peru by Chile, received a great influx of population, and\r\nworks sprang up in the midst of the desert. The nitrate fields, wholly\r\nbarren and doomed, under their shroud of grey dust, to an unalterable\r\ndesolation, became at once one of the chief centres of consumption for\r\nArgentine stock.\r\n\r\n     [23] The fattening of cattle for Chile was no longer done in\r\n     the _invernadas_ of Mendoza at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\n     century. See an article on Mendoza in the _Telegrafo\r\n     Mercantil_, January 31, 1802, which tells of the development\r\n     of ranches on the Tunuyan. Mendoza and San Juan were their\r\n     only markets, and they did not sell cattle to Chile.\r\n\r\n     [24] T. J. Hutchinson, _Buenos Aires y otras Provincias\r\n     argentinas_ (translated by L. Varela, Buenos Aires, 1866).\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give accurate details of the volume of trade in\r\ncattle in colonial Argentine. However, the facts given by travellers\r\n(though they often merely borrow from each other) suffice to show how\r\nimportant this traffic was in the life of the country and the extent\r\nof the zone that was occupied with it. As early as the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century Córdoba seems to have exported to Peru as many as\r\n28,000 to 30,000 mules annually.[25] At the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, we read in D'Azara, 60,000 mules were exported; and Helms\r\ngives the same figure.[26] The mules were bought young by Córdoba\r\ndealers at Buenos Aires, Santa Fé, and Corrientes, reared at Córdoba,\r\nand then sent to Salta, where they were sold in their third year to\r\nmule-dealers from Peru.\r\n\r\n     [25] Azcarate de Biscay, quoted in H. Gibson, _La evolucion\r\n     ganadera_ in _Censo agropecuario nacional_, Buenos Aires, 1909,\r\n     vol. iii.\r\n\r\n     [26] A. Z. Helms, _Voyage dans l'Amérique méridionale_ (Paris,\r\n     1812). The journey was in 1788.\r\n\r\nAn article in the _Telegrafo Mercantil_ of September 9, 1801\r\n(reproduced in the _Junta de Historia y Numismatica americana_, Buenos\r\nAires, 2 vols., 1914-5) contains very valuable information in regard to\r\nthe mule trade. From 1760 to 1780 Salta sent between 40,000 and 50,000\r\nmules annually to Peru. At Salta they were worth ten piastres each\r\nbefore they were broken in, and thirteen or fourteen afterwards; and\r\nthey were sold at the age of four years. The _arrieros_, who conveyed\r\nEuropean goods and home products (_ropas y frutas_), bought a large\r\nnumber of them. The _Telegrafo_ complains that this trade has been\r\ngradually transformed. The mules now came from Santa Fé and Córdoba\r\nto Salta two years old, and after the _invernada_ they were still,\r\nat fair time, barely three years old. They suffered much during the\r\nlong journey to Lima, and the losses of the caravans were heavy. They\r\ncould not be loaded for the journey, and, as the _arrieros_ could no\r\nlonger secure adult and strong animals, the freight to the tableland\r\nhad risen, to the serious loss of merchants on the coast. The reply\r\nof a Potosi mule-dealer (December 13th) clearly shows that the last\r\nyears of the eighteenth century had been marked by increasingly heavy\r\ndemands from Peru for Argentine mules. In order to meet these demands\r\nthe Córdoba breeders had developed production. The buyers, coming to\r\nSalta from Lima, Cuzco, and Arequipa, took, without discussion or\r\nexamination, the batches that were offered them. The correspondent of\r\nthe _Telegrafo_ complains bitterly of these _caballeritos_ who came\r\nfrom Peru with their 100,000 piastres, and raised the price at Salta,\r\nalleging that their instructions were to get mules at any cost.\r\n\r\nRobertson gave in 1813 the recollections of a mule-dealer as to the\r\nconvoys of mules between Santa Fé and the Andes, which had already\r\nceased at that time. Each convoy or _arreo_ comprised 5,000 to 6,000\r\nmules. They came from Entre Rios, or even from the Uruguay, whence they\r\nwere brought, after crossing the Paraná, to the Santa Fé ranches. The\r\nSanta Fé breeders owned the best part of the land on the left bank of\r\nthe river. The expedition also included thirty waggons of goods and\r\n500 draught-oxen; and fifty _gauchos_ were in charge of it. The main\r\nexpense was then tobacco and _yerba_. One feature of this mule traffic\r\nthat is emphasized in all the descriptions is that it was divided\r\ninto two stages, with an interval between them, for breaking in. As\r\nwe have already learned from Azcarate, Córdoba, Santa Fé, Santiago,\r\nand Salta kept the mules for two or three years before sending them to\r\nPeru. Córdoba and Santiago del Estero seem to have been important in\r\nconnection with the industry of breaking in the mules.\r\n\r\nThe sending of cattle on foot to Bolivia and Chile is now only a\r\nsubsidiary element of the national economy, but it is not yet quite\r\nextinct, as the table on p. 53 shows.\r\n\r\nWhatever its point of departure, the traffic in stock always passed\r\nthrough the _valles_. Transport of cattle was particularly difficult\r\nin the Argentine Andes. The chief obstacles were not the elevation of\r\nthe passes or the steepness of the roads, but the scarcity of water and\r\nthe extent of the _travesias_, which were equally poor in pasturage\r\nand water, and had to be crossed rapidly by doubling the stages. The\r\ndifficulties of the journey were very profitable to the oases that\r\nlay along the route. The cattle-driver could not dispense with the\r\nhospitality of the _vallista_ or dispute the price he cared to charge.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAP II.--IRRIGATION IN THE WEST AND NORTH-WEST OF\r\n  ARGENTINA.\r\n  _Extent of the irrigations in the north (zone of the great summer\r\n  rains), and the south (glacier zone) The historic industry of fattening\r\n  cattle in the invernadas and the export of cattle to the Andean regions\r\n  only survive in part. On the other hand large modern industries have\r\n  developed at Tucumán, Jujuy (sugar-cane), Mendoza, and San Juan\r\n  (vines), and they supply the Buenos Aires market._\r\n                                                          To face p. 52.]\r\n\r\nThe length of the journey and the difficulty of keeping the animals\r\nin good condition in the poor pastures of the breeding districts\r\nmade it advisable to stay longer in the oases. There thus arose\r\nlucerne-farms--the _invernadas_--to receive and fatten the cattle which\r\npassed through. Lucerne is the characteristic and most profitable\r\nproduce of the _valles_. It is grown wherever there is an assured\r\nsupply of water, and is invariably found in the upper section of the\r\nsystem of irrigation-channels; the cereals are sown lower down, and\r\nare the first to suffer from drought. In the _quebradas_, where space\r\nis more limited, the lucerne-fields cover the entire oasis. Every\r\ncattle track has a corresponding line of _invernadas_, which is often\r\ncompleted on the opposite slope by a last group of lucerne-farms where\r\nthe beasts recover from the journey before they are sold and dispersed.\r\n\r\n                        1910    1911    1912    1913    1914\r\n  Export of Cattle:\r\n    To Bolivia         3,600   6,600   6,200   6,300   4,800\r\n    To Chile          61,200  87,500  68,400  58,000  28,300\r\n  Export of Mules:\r\n    To Bolivia         2,700   4,600   7,900   8,300   2,500\r\n    To Chile           2,300   3,200   5,000   2,600   3,500\r\n  Export of Asses:\r\n    To Bolivia         9,000  10,500  15,000  15,600  14,400[27]\r\n\r\n     [27] Imperfect statistics given by Poncel for the province\r\n     of Catamarca give us some idea of the respective shares of\r\n     the various Andean districts in the export of Argentine\r\n     cattle about the middle of the nineteenth century. In 1855\r\n     the province of Catamarca sold 2,700 head of cattle (1,300 to\r\n     Chile, 200 to Bolivia, 600 to San Juan and Mendoza), 3,200\r\n     mules (2,500 to Bolivia 600 to Salta--which also were for\r\n     Bolivia), and 1,200 asses (700 to Bolivia and 400 to Salta).\r\n\r\nBesides the official routes there have for a long time been clandestine\r\ntracks, through more difficult ravines, by which stolen cattle were\r\nconveyed with impunity. Guachipas was the gathering place for cattle\r\nof suspicious origin, and, to avoid being seen in Salta and Jujuy,\r\nthey passed through the Quebrada del Toro or the Quebrada d'Escoïpe.\r\nWhen Brackebusch visited Guachipas in 1880 the inhabitants still kept\r\nsomething of their reputation as smugglers.\r\n\r\nA map of the cattle-tracks which are still used in the Argentine Andes\r\nis a complicated network in which we can trace two main directions,\r\ncrossing each other at right angles. One set of tracks leads to the\r\nwest, toward the Pacific coast, the other set to the north, toward the\r\nBolivian tableland.\r\n\r\nThe cattle traffic is now restricted to Chile. It survives at San Juan,\r\nJachal, Vinchina, and Tinogasta. The cattle descend to Chile about\r\nCoquimbo, Vallenar, or Copiapo. But the trade is now busiest in the\r\nregion of the saltpetre-beds. The roads lead from the Valle de Lerma\r\nand the Valle Calchaqui toward the tableland by the Quebrada del Toro\r\nor the Quebrada de Cachi or de Luracatao, crossing lofty passes at the\r\nfoot of the Nevados of Acay and Cachi, and reuniting between Santa\r\nRosa de Pastos Grandes and San Antonio de los Cobres to cross the\r\nPuna de Atacama. _Vegas_ (pastures) and fresh water are scarce here.\r\nThe track passes interminably by depressions covered with a carpet of\r\nglistening salt, dominated by volcanic crests. It is used in every\r\nseason of the year, but in winter the caravans are exposed to the cold\r\nwind laden with snow, the _viento blanco_. San Pedro is the port in\r\nthis desolation. Here there are, on the flanks of the enormous cone of\r\nLicancour, fields of lucerne and groups of figs and _algarrobas_. The\r\ncattle are left there for a few days' rest, to prepare them for the\r\nlast stage, the Calama oasis on the Antofágasta railway.\r\n\r\nThe centre of this trade is Salta, or, rather, the little village of\r\nRosario de Lerma, nine miles south of it, where most of the caravans\r\nare formed. The saltpetre works make yearly contracts in advance with\r\nthe Rosario dealers, fixing the number and price of the beasts to be\r\ndelivered at Calama. The cost of transport includes, besides the pay\r\nof the cattle-drivers--eighty to a hundred piastres a journey--the\r\nshoeing of the mules, the rent of pasture at San Pedro, and the value\r\nof the beasts which die on the way. In 1913 the number of animals\r\nexported by this route was put at 30,000. The saltpetre works buy also\r\ndraught-mules for their waggons. Draught-mules must be heavy, and only\r\nanimals over five feet in height are sent to Chile. Bolivia is now the\r\nonly market for the smaller mules and for asses.\r\n\r\nThe trade in mules in its traditional form and the industry of\r\nbreaking-in still flourish at Santa Maria. The mule-dealer's business\r\nis very different from that of the cattle-dealer. The mules are\r\nso tough that it is possible to send them by roads which would be\r\nunsuitable for cattle.[28] The journeys are longer, and the contracts\r\nare less settled in advance. Moreover, breaking-in is a delicate\r\noperation that requires experience. The survival of the mule-trade at\r\nSanta Maria is an example of the maintenance of an industry owing to\r\nthe presence of skilled handicraft. The men who break in the mules at\r\nSanta Maria have a remarkable caste-pride. Their first job is to go to\r\nSantiago or Córdoba to buy the mules. They bring them back to Santa\r\nMaria by way of Catamarca or the valley of Tafi. At Santa Maria the\r\nmules are broken in, then taken to the lucerne-farms at Poma to be put\r\ninto good condition. There they remain in pasture for several months;\r\nand at length, when the season is suitable, the little band of Santa\r\nMarieños gathers together and, driving the now docile beasts in front\r\nof them, and putting no loads on them in order that they may keep\r\nfresh, make for the fair at Huari in Bolivia, or even as far as Sucre.\r\nThere they sell at a hundred and fifty piastres each the animals which\r\nthey had bought for half that price before being broken in. The number\r\nof mules hibernating at Poma is about 4,000.\r\n\r\n     [28] For instance, herds of mules are taken from Abrapampa, on\r\n     the line of the Quiaca, to the saltpetre mines of Antofágasta,\r\n     whereas every effort to convey cattle by this route has failed.\r\n\r\nThe business done in the fairs of the southern Andes is very varied in\r\ncharacter, but their main function was always as markets for stock.[29]\r\nThey are held in March or April, when the rains do not fall, but\r\npasture is still abundant and travelling easy. The fair at Vilque,\r\nnorth of Lake Titicaca, is no longer visited by dealers in Argentine\r\nmules. The Salta fair which was held at Sumala, near Rosario de Lerma,\r\nhas ceased to be important; at the close of the eighteenth century\r\nit was the chief centre of the mule-trade. The fair held at Jujuy is\r\nstill, like the annual pilgrimage to the Virgen del Valle de Catamarca,\r\none of the great dates in the life of the Andes. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury it was mainly a cattle-fair, but it is now frequented only by\r\nmule-dealers. The development of the railways is gradually causing it\r\nto decline.\r\n\r\n     [29] There is an interesting study of fairs on the elevated\r\n     tableland by G. M. Wrigley, \"Fairs of the Central Andes,\" in\r\n     the _Geographical Review_ (New York), vii. 1919, pp. 65-80.\r\n\r\nThe cattle-trade has long been really a form of barter. The\r\nArgentinians who took their herds to Peru brought back with them\r\nEuropean goods that had come via Panama and the Pacific. At Jachal\r\ndirect communication with Argentina is still so costly that they\r\nprefer to get many manufactured articles from Chile. Everywhere\r\nelse, however, the sellers of stock take payment in cash. The Santa\r\nMarieños bring back from Bolivia only a few bags of coca and, for\r\nchief payment, letters of exchange, which they cash in the Salta banks\r\nwhen they return. Their gains swell the profits of the merchants of\r\nSalta, Catamarca, and Jujuy, who get their goods at the large importing\r\nhouses of Buenos Aires. It is the first form under which the influence\r\nof Buenos Aires reaches the _valles_. It gets their custom before it\r\nbegins to absorb their produce.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the stock sent to Chile now comes from the\r\nAndean valleys themselves. The most arid and desolate regions round\r\nthe oases breed only goats and asses; but as soon as the soil improves\r\nsufficiently to give a better vegetation, it is found good enough for\r\na hardy and tenacious breed of horned cattle. The land is divided\r\ninto large ranches, and the owners have also lucerne-farms, either\r\nindividually or communally, the tillers of the oasis each putting in\r\ntheir beasts, which wander about in small groups without control.\r\nDuring the summer they go of their own accord up to the _cerros_,\r\nwhere the rains have brought out the vegetation, and drinking-water is\r\nfound in the ravines for several months. In the winter they return to\r\nthe valley, within range of the reservoirs and permanent _acequias_.\r\nBodenbender gives us a few details about movements from place to place\r\nowing to such differences, as they are in vogue in the western part of\r\nthe province of La Rioja, in the district of Guandacol. There the herds\r\nare taken during years of drought up to the mountains of the west.\r\n\r\nApart from the Andes, the zone which used to feel the influence of\r\nthe trans-Andean markets has been steadily reduced in the last forty\r\nyears. At one time it comprised the whole range of the scrub, and\r\neven overflowed upon the prairie region, but it is now limited to the\r\nnearest cantons to the fringe of the mountains. Over the greater part\r\nof the _monte_ the cattle are now sent in other directions; either to\r\nBuenos Aires or to other Argentine towns with a growing population,\r\nsuch as Córdoba, Mendoza, and Tucumán.\r\n\r\nThe rupture of commercial relations with Chile has, however, not made\r\nany notable change in the pastoral industry. Pastoral life in the scrub\r\nhas very uniform characters. It is chiefly dominated by the question of\r\nwater-supply. Natural open water is scarce, and the cattle can drink\r\nonly where man's industry makes it possible. The problem of taming the\r\nbeasts, which the breeders on the prairies have not always been able to\r\nsolve, is simplified by the scarcity of water. There is no need to hunt\r\nthe cattle, no periodical _rodeos_, when the herd is drawn in every\r\nnight by thirst to the water-supply. Advance in colonization means the\r\nprovision of wells and reservoirs (_baldes_ and _represas_), without\r\nwhich the breeders cannot occupy the plain permanently, but have to\r\nfall back during the dry season upon the few streams that cross it.\r\nThe word _balderia_ means districts where the presence of a sheet of\r\nwater not far underground has enabled them to form a system of wells.\r\nThe best known is the Balderia Puntana, in the northern part of the\r\nprovince of San Luis.\r\n\r\nOf the regions apart from the Andes which still depend on the Chilean\r\nmarket it will be enough to mention two, which may be regarded as\r\ntypical. The first is the Chaco Salteño, on the eastern slope of the\r\nSierra de la Lumbrera. The Lumbrera is a lofty anticlinal range of\r\nlimestones and red sandstones, which pass to the west underneath the\r\nclay of the Chaco plain, and separate it from the great longitudinal\r\nsub-Andean corridor, which was followed by the old road, and is now\r\nfollowed by the railway from Tucumán to Jujuy. Colonization began\r\nbeyond the Lumbrera in the eighteenth century by passing round it, from\r\nsouth to north, by the valleys of the Juramento and the San Francisco\r\n(which joins the Bermejo). The ranches, which employed the Indians--the\r\noccupation of the Chaco at this point being pacific--bordered the\r\nBermejo and the Rio del Valle, which flows from the Lumbrera range\r\ntoward the former bed of the Bermejo, and washes the foot of the range\r\nat the edge of the plain.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DRY SCRUB OF THE CENTRAL CHACO.\r\n  _On the Añatuya line (province of Santiago del Estero).

To face p. 58.]\r\n\r\nThe cattle live in the scrub during the summer, when the rains have\r\nbrought out the grasses. In winter they go up to the moist forest, with\r\nperennial vegetation, which covers the flanks of the range.[30] The\r\ncomparative abundance of water lessens the labour of the breeders and,\r\nat the same time, the discipline of the herds. When the time comes,\r\nthe whole ranch is mobilized for the purpose of collecting the adult\r\ncattle and making a convoy of them. Horsemen, with the double leather\r\napron which hangs at the saddle-bow to protect them from the branches,\r\nride up the range with their dogs and plunge into the scrub. The savage\r\nbeasts are rounded up and held at bay. The procession is formed, and\r\nsets out, either by the rugged paths across the forest and mountain or\r\nalong the easier tracks over the plain to Embarcación or Lumbreras,\r\nwhere they reach the railway. If buyers from the sugar-refineries at\r\nJujuy do not take them, the cattle are put into trucks and sent to\r\nthe Salta market, where there are sales all the year round. At Salta\r\nthe beasts are fattened on the lucerne-farms before crossing the\r\nCordillera. There is hardly any tillage, either because the winter\r\ndrought makes the result dubious or because the breeders are not good\r\nat agricultural work.\r\n\r\n     [30] On Aconcagua also the moist forest serves as winter\r\n     pasture for the cattle from the ranches.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra de los Llanos in La Rioja is another centre for extensive\r\nbreeding. From the railway, which follows the range at some distance,\r\nbetween Chañar and Puntá de los Llanos, before it reaches La Rioja,\r\nno one would have the least suspicion of the importance and life of\r\nthe region. It is, nevertheless, one of the main foci of Argentine\r\nhistory. It has proved a cradle of population and wealth. It was there\r\nthat Quiroga and, later, the strange adventurer who was known by the\r\nnickname of the \"Chacho\" gathered the strength that enabled them to\r\ndominate part of Argentina. Colonization is even older here than in\r\nthe Chaco Salteño. It occupied two distinct periods, separated by a\r\nlong interval. At first it advanced from north to south, passing round\r\nthe foot of the Sierra. It is marked by a line of springs, poor but\r\npermanent, the waters of which are absorbed as soon as they flow down\r\nto the porous alluvial beds of the plain. They appear much in the names\r\nof the district--_agüitas_, _aguaditas_, and so on, abound. The road\r\nfrom La Rioja to San Luis passed these springs, and some population\r\ngrew up about them. Thus the two sides of the range--the _costa baja_\r\nin the east and the _costa alta_ in the west--became inhabited. The\r\nestate of Facundo is one of these _aguaditas_ of the _costa alta_.\r\n\r\nThe two _costas_ form the historic territory of the Llanos. It was from\r\nthere that colonization swarmed over the plain long afterwards. This\r\nexpansive movement began about 1850; that is to say, at a time when the\r\nbreeders enjoyed comparative peace and security, and especially when\r\nthe _invernadas_ of San Juan and Mendoza were developed, together with\r\nthe export of cattle to the agricultural provinces of Chile. The price\r\nof stock rose, and the unoccupied land became of value. The occupation\r\nand exploitation of the plain was the work of the last two generations.\r\nThey pushed on to the very edge of the salt lakes, leaving no vacant\r\nspace. The _travesias_ which surrounded the narrow inhabited zone of\r\nthe _costas_ were filled with life. The Sierra and its two _costas_\r\nare no longer an oasis in the desert, as they were in the time of\r\nSarmiento; though they still differ from the remainder of the pastoral\r\nzone in the density of their population and the variety of their\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nThe early date of the colonization may be traced in a special system\r\nof tenure, though this is also found in parts of the provinces of\r\nCatamarca and Santiago del Estero. On the plain the right of ownership\r\nwas obtained in the nineteenth century by purchase or by concessions\r\nof public lands which belonged to the provincial Government. They were\r\nallotted in very large estates, and these, intact or broken up, are\r\nthe actual ranches. In approaching the foot of the range one passes\r\nestates in the _mercedes_. The name indicates concessions that date\r\nfrom the colonial epoch, and they are, in all parts of South America\r\nthat were early colonized, the source of land-ownership. But what is\r\npeculiar to the _mercedes_ of the Llanos is that they have never been\r\ndivided amongst the heirs of the first owner.[31] Sometimes the number\r\nof co-proprietors is small. They are conscious of their relationship\r\nto each other and know the value of the rights of each. The _merced_\r\nis in that case only an undivided property held in common. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, the numbers of _comuneros_ is so great that they have lost\r\ncount of the exact share of the _merced_ which belongs to each of them.\r\nThe _merced_ feeds a whole population, legitimate heirs and usurpers\r\nmixed together. In these cases it is a real communal property, and one\r\nmight compare it, in spite of its different origin, with the Indian\r\ncommunities which exist in Argentine territory as well as that of most\r\nof the other Andean States.\r\n\r\n     [31] The title of the _merced_ often shows clearly the\r\n     attraction which the springs at the foot of the Sierra had for\r\n     colonists. The land of the _merced_ of Ulapes is defined thus:\r\n     \"The spring and the land within two leagues of it in every\r\n     direction.\" The spring is the centre. There its protecting\r\n     deities live.\r\n\r\nThe economy of the Llanos is less simple than that of the Chaco\r\nSalteño. There is agriculture as well as breeding. There is not much\r\nrain, and it is confined to the summer months. The mean rainfall is,\r\nno doubt, higher than what we find at La Rioja (about 30 centimetres),\r\nbut it is not good enough to dispense with irrigation. The _aguadas_,\r\nsprings and brooks at the foot of the range, are the only provision of\r\npermanent water, and it is very limited. The oases watered by these\r\nsprings and brooks cover only a few acres at the foot of the steep\r\ncliffs of the range. It has not been possible to cultivate the land\r\nfar from the mountains. At Chamical a trench that was made to convey\r\nwater to the railway dried up. All that can be done is to follow for\r\na few miles with a line of wells a subterranean stream of fresh and\r\nnot very deep water. At Bella Vista a _comunero_ has dug an _acequia_\r\nseveral miles long, and he sells the water at a rate of five piastres\r\nfor forty-eight hours. But when it reaches the end of the _acequia_, it\r\nis lost between the trench and the field to which they would conduct\r\nit. At Ulapes, though it is one of the chief centres, it takes the full\r\noutflow of the spring during sixteen hours to irrigate one _cuadra_ (a\r\nlittle over two acres), and each man's \"turn\" is for seventeen days.\r\nThe entire oasis measures about fifty acres. At Olta the thin stream of\r\nwater is surrounded by so many cupidities that the \"turn\" comes only\r\nevery fifty-eight days, so that each field has to live fifty-eight days\r\non one watering. At Catuna where a trickle of brackish water is eagerly\r\ncollected at the foot of a dejection-cone, the water-right is regulated\r\nby an arrangement of turns that covers ninety days, so that plants die\r\nof thirst in the interval. The plots vary according to the quantity,\r\nquality, and regularity of the water. The orange-tree is the most\r\nexacting, the fig the most tenacious, of the trees. The poorest oases\r\nconsist only of a few gardens of dusty fig-trees.\r\n\r\nHowever small it is, the oasis always stands for a rudiment of communal\r\nlife, a _poblado_, a centre round which life is organized in this\r\npastoral, anarchic, amorphous world. Land that has a water-right is\r\nregarded as detached from the _merced_ and never remains undivided.\r\n\r\nBesides these properly irrigated lands there are the _bañados_:\r\ncultivated plots in the hollows, where the moisture left by the storms\r\nis concentrated and preserved. These are much more extensive, and they\r\nare very irregularly distributed. Inequalities of the alluvial ground\r\nthat almost escape the eye are sufficient to direct the streaming of\r\nthe water after rain, and it is quickly absorbed. Man assists nature as\r\nwell as he can, and one sees everywhere tiny ridges of earth across the\r\npaths, for the purpose of diverting the water to the plots. These are\r\nthe _tomas_. When you follow a _toma_ downward, you see it after a time\r\npass under a hedge of dry thorn, and this encloses a field, a _cerco_.\r\nThe crops have to be jealously guarded against the cattle which roam in\r\nthe scrub. The _cercos_ are sometimes so numerous that they give the\r\nimpression of a regular agricultural district. Most of them are planted\r\nwith maize. The maize harvest rarely fails in the summer, for it is\r\nthen, on account of the regular rains, that the maize grows and ripens.\r\nWhen the ears have been gathered, the cattle are let into the _cerco_,\r\nas maize-straw is excellent fodder. But wheat also grows well in the\r\n_bañados_. Provided the year has had a few late showers, the wheat sown\r\nin autumn stands the winter drought more or less well, and ripens after\r\nthe early rains, at the beginning of summer. The Llanos produce a hard\r\nwheat; it is not milled, but eaten, like rice, in the grain. There have\r\nbeen times when the Llanos have exported wheat. The census of 1888\r\ngives the Department of General Belgrano, on the eastern slope of the\r\nLlanos, an area of 900 acres under maize and 1,900 under wheat. When\r\nthe Chilecito railway was constructed, this wheat competed with that\r\nbrought on mules from Jachal, in the mining district of the Famatina\r\nrange. Like the gardens in the oases, the _cercos_ may be divided, and\r\nthey are the personal property of those who cultivate them.\r\n\r\nSowing and reaping are, however, mere episodes in the life of the\r\n_Llanero_. He is mainly occupied with cattle-breeding. The quality\r\nof the pasture differs considerably according to the nature of the\r\nsoil and the good and bad character of the season. Sometimes it forms\r\na thick carpet under the brushwood, but in other places it is poor\r\nand there is nothing but the leaves and pods of the _algarroba_. If\r\nthe herd is too large, the grass will not grow again; the breeder\r\nrecognizes at a glance the _campo recargado_--the field which has had\r\nits capacity overstrained. The pasture has to be carefully nursed. But\r\nthe most urgent problem is to get a supply of water for the cattle.\r\nRound the Sierra the underground water is often fresh, and there are\r\nplenty of wells. Still, in order to avoid having to draw the water,\r\nthey dig large trenches at suitable spots in the clay, and round\r\nthese they arrange the earth that has been dug out, with an opening\r\ntoward the hills to catch the water when it is raining. These are the\r\n_represas_. As in the case of the _bañados_, ridges of earth direct the\r\nstream to the _represa_. It is surrounded by a hedge as carefully as\r\nthe field is. On the plain rain is rare, and the _represas_ are usually\r\nthe only reserve. They have to last the whole year; even two years if\r\nthere is a particularly dry summer that prevents re-filling. Thus they\r\nbecome sometimes veritable lakes. From a distance you can see, above\r\nthe top of the brushwood, the bald curve of the mound of beaten earth\r\nwhich encircles them. The water flows over it when there has been much\r\nrain. The mound is sometimes 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 yards high; as it is at\r\nTello, between the Sierra d'Ulapes and the Sierra de los Llanos, where\r\nthe San Juan coach used to change horses.\r\n\r\nThe _represa_ is the real centre of the estate. The house is built near\r\nit, and guards the entrance. From early morning until dusk the cattle\r\ncome to it, singly or in groups. The rancher admits them, lets them\r\ndrink, and closes the gate behind them. If the thirsty cattle have not\r\nhis mark and belong to a neighbour, he sends them to drink at their own\r\n_represa_; but he gives water to lost beasts, from a distance, whose\r\nowner will presently come for them. Near the _represa_ is the enclosure\r\n(_potrero_) for calves that have just been born. The cows come there\r\nevery morning, and they are milked for a few months to make cheese.\r\nLike the _cerco_, the _represa_ is the personal property of the man who\r\nmade it, or of one who has inherited it and sees to its upkeep.\r\n\r\nThe cattle of the Llanos move a good deal. There are certain irregular\r\nmigrations, and others that are periodic or connected with the seasons.\r\nEverywhere on the fringe of the Sierra the cattle remain in the ravine\r\nand on the foot-hills during the winter. In the summer they return of\r\nthemselves to their _querencia_ on the plain. The irregular migrations\r\nare due to scarcity of water or pasture. Driven by hunger, the beasts\r\ntravel a long distance of their own accord. They mingle with other\r\nherds, sometimes so far from the ranches where they were born that no\r\none recognizes their mark. Sometimes, again, the rancher himself goes,\r\nwhen his _represa_ is dry, to ask hospitality in some more favoured\r\ncanton. He is fortunate if the drought has not been general; if part of\r\nthe country has been spared and can offer a refuge.\r\n\r\nBut it sometimes happens that the whole district has suffered, and the\r\nland is naked and scorched everywhere. There is then no help except\r\na long journey, to San Luis or to the lucerne-farms of San Juan, for\r\nthe cattle. The misfortune of the Llanos sends up at once the rent\r\nof the _invernadas_ all round. A general evacuation of the cattle is\r\na desperate remedy, and is, in fact, often impracticable. During the\r\nwhole summer the men wait patiently, hoping for the end of the drought.\r\nThere is room for hope until April, when storms are still possible. If\r\nthe month ends without rain, it is too late to remove the exhausted\r\ncattle; the stages across the desolated country are too severe.\r\n\r\nThe memory of the worst years of drought--the \"epidemics,\" as the\r\nLlanero calls them--lives for a long time. They make a deep impression\r\non the popular imagination, and legend makes plagues of them, in the\r\nBiblical way. The drought of 1884 was particularly disastrous. The\r\nherds were destroyed, and families that had been wealthy the day before\r\nset out on foot, \"having nothing to put a saddle on\": a touching\r\npicture of misery for this race of centaurs, people who feel themselves\r\nmutilated when they are not on horse. The rain returns next year. The\r\npasture grows all the better because the herd is smaller, and the\r\nLlanos give the traveller who crosses them an exaggerated impression of\r\ntheir natural wealth.\r\n\r\nUntil quite a recent date the cattle reared in the Llanos were destined\r\nexclusively for Chile. Dealers from Jachal or Tinogasta came in the\r\nautumn, and the cattle passed the winter in the _invernadas_ at the\r\nfoot of the Cordillera. From the Sierra d'Ulapes, which is a southward\r\ncontinuation of the Llanos, the cattle destined for Chile were first\r\nsent to San Juan. They took one or two weeks to reach it. Five men were\r\nneeded for a herd of a hundred beasts: eight for a herd of two hundred.\r\nThe caravan was directed by an _estanciero_ (rancher) or his _capataz_,\r\nor by dealers who came originally from the Llanos.\r\n\r\nExports to Chile have not entirely ceased. In 1913 the dealers from\r\nTinogasta and Jachal, who had not appeared in 1912, came back. The\r\nsouthern part of the Sierra d'Ulapes, which is some distance from the\r\nrailway, reserves its cattle for San Juan. The cattle are, however,\r\nmore and more sent by rail to the coast. In the Sierra d'Ulapes the\r\ndealers from Villa Mercedes, which has become one of the great markets\r\nof Argentina, come every year, rent an enclosure (_protrero_), and\r\ncollect in it, one by one, a herd of cattle, which they then take away\r\non foot. They are sold at the fair at Villa Mercedes, and they disperse\r\nin every direction toward the fattening zones of the Pampa.\r\n\r\nThis commercial revolution has led to a rise in the price of cattle,\r\nand this in turn has raised the value of land. When the value of the\r\nland rises, the methods of working it are necessarily improved, there\r\nis greater security, and thefts of cattle (_cuatrerismo_) become\r\nimpossible. The farmers are not content merely to enlarge their\r\n_represas_ or dig deeper wells. They divide the fields by fences--cheap\r\niron wire stretched on home-made posts, or hedges of spines like those\r\nwhich protect the _bañados_. Thus pasture can be reserved untouched for\r\nthe difficult months.\r\n\r\nThis subdivision of the land by fences began in the south, in the\r\nUlapes district, in touch with the richer districts of San Luis and\r\nCórdoba. In the Llanos proper the practice has scarcely begun. At\r\nUlapes it is even done on the _mercedes_. Each _comunero_, without\r\nopposition, encloses as much space as he can, and leaves his cattle\r\noutside, on the common land, as long as possible. He only brings them\r\ninto his enclosed land when the common pasture is exhausted. This will\r\nbring about the end of the _mercedes_; and, indeed, communal ownership\r\nis not suited to modern conditions. The latest sign of progress is the\r\nappearance of lucerne fields. Lucerne can be grown on the _bañados_\r\nwherever anything else can be grown; and the creation of lucerne-farms\r\nwill give the pastoral industry a security and stability it never had\r\nbefore, besides enabling the breeders to collect stores of dry forage\r\nand exploit the full pastoral capacity of the _monte_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTUCUMÁN AND MENDOZA THE GREAT INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES\r\n\r\n     Tucumán and the road to Chile--The climate and the cultivation\r\n     of the sugar-cane--The problem of manual labour--Irrigation at\r\n     Mendoza--Water-rights--Viticulture--Protection and the natural\r\n     conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great industrial forms of cultivation, the sugar-cane and the\r\nvine, gave a new aspect to the scenery of Tucumán and Mendoza at the\r\nend of the nineteenth century. The increase of population and wealth\r\nwhich they entailed was so sudden, the economic advance so swift,\r\nthat the owners of vineyards and the sugar-makers have now lost all\r\nrecollection of the primitive industries which gave life to colonial\r\nTucumán and Mendoza, and were maintained until the last generation.\r\nNevertheless, if one compares Tucumán or Mendoza with some centre of\r\nirrigated tillage in north-west Argentina, one quickly perceives the\r\noriginal features which three centuries of history have given them. The\r\nsystem of land-tenure, water-rights, the distribution of the cultivated\r\nzones, and a thousand other features, show that the colonization is\r\nold. The exploitation of the soil and utilization of the water have\r\nnot proceeded on a methodical plan, conceived in advance, which would\r\nmake each piece of work--the dams and channels of distribution, for\r\ninstance--subordinate to the whole. The engineers who constructed the\r\ngreat modern dams of Mendoza, San Juan and Sali, had not to create a\r\nregion of new estates, but merely to improve the water-supply, which\r\nwas used wastefully by the existing estates. There is nothing more\r\nsuggestive than the contrast between these stone dams, built according\r\nto all the rules of hydraulics, and the network of irregular channels,\r\nfollowing the accidental variations of the land and the slope, which\r\npreceded them, and to which they have been accommodated as far as\r\npossible. In some cases the primitive _acequias_ could not be altered\r\nso as to start from the dam. The accumulations of water succeed each\r\nother down the slope, held up by a simple barrier of branches and earth\r\nwhich is periodically destroyed by floods. The modern flood-proof dam\r\n(_dique nivelador_), which cuts the torrent in its entire width, and\r\nenables them to make use of its whole volume, allows a certain amount\r\nof water to pass, for the use of the _acequias_ lower down. This falls\r\nback into the broad, stony bed, exposed to evaporation and infiltration\r\nas it was before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLong before the development of the sugar industry on a large scale,\r\nthere was a typically urban life, added to the common fund of pastoral\r\nlife, at Tucumán. The neighbouring cantons of the scrub--Trancas,\r\nBurruyacu, and Graneros--sent cattle and mules to Peru and Chile, like\r\nthe other Argentine plains. But Tucumán drew still greater profit from\r\nits position as chief stage on the high road to Peru, at the point\r\nwhere the plain passes into the mountain. Primitive Tucumán was an\r\nexcellent type of high-road village. The road determined its position\r\nat the point where the Sali had to be crossed. The first site of the\r\ntown, near Monteros, was abandoned in the eighteenth century, when\r\nthe high road to Peru settled in the sub-Andean region and ceased\r\nto run through the Calchaqui valley. The road sustained its chief\r\nindustries, tanning and harness-making for the muleteers of the Andes,\r\nand waggon-making for the _troperos_ of the plain. The road and the\r\npeople travelling along it afforded an outlet for its wheat and flour,\r\nand facilitated the export of its tobacco to the coast-provinces. The\r\nwaggon-owners were really contractors, conveying stuff at their own\r\ncost. Moreover, part of Bolivia came to make its purchases at the shops\r\n(_tiendas_) of Tucumán, and the merchants of the town took in exchange\r\nBolivian ore for export. Thus the road built up a nucleus of available\r\ncapital at Tucumán. This capital was invested, at the close of the\r\nnineteenth century, in sugar; and it has increased a hundredfold. Most\r\nof the works still belong to old families of the town.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-region is comparatively small. It covers an area which\r\nhas exceptional climatic features, owing to the vicinity of Mount\r\nAconcagua. While the higher chains of the Andes further north are\r\nseparated from the Chaco plain by lower ranges, on which the east winds\r\nleave their stores of moisture less freely, Tucumán has on its west the\r\ngreat mass of Aconcagua. It rises, a giant landmark, at the beginning\r\nof the plains, from which there is nothing to separate it, and gathers\r\nthe clouds round it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE VALLE OF SANTA MARIA, NORTH-WEST OF MOUNT ACONCAGUA.\r\n  _At the bottom of the valle one can see the sandy bed of the river as\r\n  a white line in the foreground.

To face p. 70.]\r\n\r\nOn the eastern slope of Aconcagua is the limit of the crescent of\r\ntropical forest, which begins about three thousand miles away, on the\r\nflank of the Venezuelan and Colombian Cordilleras, and is connected\r\nin the centre, in the equatorial zone, from Guaviare to Mamore, with\r\nthe forests of the Amazon region. At its two ends it is reduced to a\r\nnarrow belt which does not reach, in the east, the alluvial plains,\r\nthe savannahs of the Orinoco and the scrub of the Chaco. The humid\r\nforest of the Argentine Andes is nowhere more luxuriant than near its\r\nsouthern limit, above Tucumán. There are no palms or tree-ferns, but\r\nthe convolvulus abounds, and the evergreen trees are covered with\r\nepiphytes. Aconcagua is one of the sharpest climatological limits in\r\nthe world. In the latitude of Salta one has only to go about 150 miles\r\nto pass from the moist forests of the sub-Andean chain of the Lumbrera\r\nto the arid valley of Cachi. On both sides of Aconcagua there are less\r\nthan fifty-five miles between the sugar-cane fields won from the forest\r\nand the oasis of Andalgala, or that of Santa Maria, which are right in\r\nthe desert zone. According as one approaches Aconcagua from the east or\r\nthe west, one finds, from base to summit, either the successive stages\r\nof vegetation of the humid Andes--from forest to grain-sown prairie\r\n(_paramo_ or _pajonal_)--or those which are characteristic of the arid\r\nAndes, from the spiny scrub of the valleys to the fields of resinous\r\n_tola_ of the Puna. The contrast of climates is repeated in the\r\ncharacter of the soils. Aconcagua contains in itself the entire Andes\r\nin miniature. At the foot of the narrow zone of Alpine crests, in the\r\nfew square miles of the elevated valleys of Tafi and Pucara, there is a\r\nsmall agricultural and pastoral world, in a temperate climate, that has\r\nnothing quite like it elsewhere, narrowly confined between the forest\r\nand the desert.[32]\r\n\r\n     [32] The higher valleys of Aconcagua offer inexhaustible\r\n     interest to the visitor. At Sancho (Pucara valley) there is a\r\n     group of Italian colonists who grow maize and wheat: a unique\r\n     fact, I believe, in the whole of this part of Argentina. The\r\n     Tafi valley is mainly pastoral, the pastures of the valley\r\n     being used in summer and the forest for winter pasture.\r\n\r\nThe sugar district of Tucumán is not, properly speaking, an oasis; that\r\nis to say, it is not an irrigated canton in the midst of a desert, but\r\na moist patch in the heart of a less favoured region. The traveller who\r\ncomes from the Chaco finds that the dust disappears from the moister\r\nair as he approaches Tucumán. The rainfall approaches 974 millimetres\r\nat Tucumán. Irrigation is a valuable aid to the farmer, but it is not\r\nindispensable. Maize is generally raised without watering, and part\r\neven of the sugar-cane crop is raised on land that is not irrigated. It\r\nis not the relatively heavy rainfall that has led to the development of\r\nthe sugar-cane estates at Tucumán, but the evenness of the temperature,\r\ntogether with the atmospheric moisture and the rareness of frost.\r\nThe mists which develop at the foot of Aconcagua form a protecting\r\nmantle above Tucumán which prevents nocturnal radiation. The nearer\r\none gets to the mountain, the later, rarer, and lighter the frosts\r\nare. If, on the contrary, one goes out some distance westward toward\r\nthe plain, the frost becomes more severe, and it is impossible to grow\r\nsugar-cane. Not only the humidity, but the contour also, has some\r\ninfluence on the changes of temperature and the distribution of frost.\r\nThe depressions in which the cold air accumulates, in virtue of the\r\nwell-known meteorological phenomenon of inversion of temperature, are\r\nmore exposed than sloping districts, where the air circulates regularly\r\nand freely. The eastern limit of the zone spared by the frosts passes\r\nabout thirty-five miles from the foot of Aconcagua. It has only been\r\nmade clear by experiment, and one can still see there the traces of\r\nabandoned plantations.\r\n\r\nThe water-supply in the Tucumán district consists, primarily, of\r\nnumerous evenly flowing streams which come down the eastern flank of\r\nAconcagua (Lules, Famailla, Angostura, Gastona, Medinas, etc.). They\r\njoin the Sali to the south of Tucumán. The Sali is an irregular torrent\r\nwhich rises in the sub-Andean depression to the north and Tucumán,\r\nand, after squeezing Aguadita between the north-eastern extremity of\r\nAconcagua and the sub-Andean chain of Burruyacu, enters the plain\r\nat Tucumán. It then flows southward, meandering over a large bed of\r\nshingle in which it has not had force enough to excavate a valley, and\r\nthe inclination of the land on its left bank (to the east) is toward\r\nthe east and south-east. The lands on the right bank of the Sali are\r\nconsequently better provided with water than those on the left bank.\r\nThe difference is so marked that, as the estates on the right bank get\r\nmost of their supply elsewhere, the water of the Sali nearly all goes\r\nto the left bank. In 1912 a siphon was actually constructed underneath\r\nthe bed of the Sali to convey the unused water of the Rio Lules to the\r\nright bank. Lastly, to the north of Tucumán the Sierra de Burruyacu\r\nprovides a few intermittent streams of water, which the _estancias_\r\n(ranches) formerly conducted, with great labour, to their _represas_.\r\nThese do not suffice for irrigation on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane was first grown at the gates of the town and, to the\r\neast, at Cruz Alta, on the left bank of the Sali. These were some\r\ndistance from the mountain because, as there was less rain and the\r\nsoil was fairly dry, the natural vegetation was less luxuriant, and\r\nit cost less to prepare the ground.[33] The Central Córdoba Railway,\r\nwhich passes along the right bank of the Sali south of Tucumán, is the\r\naxis of another zone of cultivation and of old factories. Colonization\r\nafterwards went further west. A new provincial railway, describing a\r\nsection of a circle, was grafted at Tucumán (1888-90) and Madria upon\r\nthe Central Córdoba line. It keeps close to the foot of the range, the\r\n_falda_, and enables farmers to settle on it. The new estates have not\r\nconfined themselves to the alluvial plain; they have crept up the foot\r\nhills, and are constantly going higher. In the latitude of Tucumán\r\nthe mountain approaches within eight or twelve miles of the Sali, and\r\nthe possibilities of extension westward are strictly limited; indeed,\r\nthey are already exhausted. Further south, on the contrary, the plain\r\nextends more than fifteen miles to the east of the provincial railway.\r\nWest of Monteros, Concepción, and the existing line of works, there\r\nis a reserve of available land; there is room for a fresh advance\r\nwestward. There is also room for expansion to the north-east, at the\r\nfoot of the sub-Andean chain of Burruyacu, where the frosts are slight.\r\nIt is in this direction that most of the clearing is now going on.\r\n\r\n     [33] In 1894 it was calculated that ground that was not yet\r\n     cleared was worth 100 to 150 piastres a hectare at Cruz Alta,\r\n     and the cost of clearing 150 to 200 piastres, whereas in the\r\n     moist forest at the foot of the Sierra the land was worth only\r\n     75 to 100 piastres, the cost of clearing it was double (300 to\r\n     350 piastres).\r\n\r\nThese various districts do not offer quite the same conditions to the\r\nfarmer. The _Falda_ is the most suitable, not only on account of the\r\nrareness of frost, but because of the fertility of the soil, as the\r\ntropical forest has accumulated inexhaustible stores of humus. The\r\nsugar-cane returns are higher there than anywhere else. Irrigation\r\nis not necessary, but, on the other hand, the humidity reduces the\r\nproportion of sugar in the cane. Irrigation is the rule in the next\r\nbelt, between the local railway and the Central Córdoba line (on the\r\nright bank of the Sali). On the left bank a large number of the estates\r\nmust still do without watering.\r\n\r\nThe most original feature of the organization of the sugar industry\r\nat Tucumán is the maintenance of a class of independent cultivators,\r\nthe _cañeros_, side by side with the large enterprises. This survival\r\nof small and medium properties is a fact to which we find no parallel\r\nin the other sugar districts of tropical America.[34] Everywhere\r\nelse, in Brazil and in the Antilles, the farms which worked up their\r\nown produce, on primitive methods, have been absorbed by the central\r\nworks. The home-worker has lost his land as well as been ruined in\r\nhis industry by the competition of the modern factory. At Tucumán, on\r\nthe contrary, the sugar industry never passed through the stage of\r\ndomestic production. It was set up in full development, some devoting\r\ntheir capital to building works, others to growing the cane. Irrigation\r\nseemed from the first to dictate a concentration of ownership; the\r\nrefineries at Cruz Alta constructed costly special canals to bring the\r\nwater of the Sali. It is only large proprietors who have the resources\r\nneeded to carry out work of this kind, and sufficient influence to\r\nsecure permission to conduct the water over adjoining estates. However,\r\nthe law of 1897 reorganized irrigation and withdrew the water-supply\r\nfrom the control of a few privileged big capitalists. Public works,\r\nundertaken by the provincial authorities, brought the water within the\r\nreach of every farmer. Since 1897 the number of water-concessions has\r\nrisen from 230 to nearly 2,000.\r\n\r\n     [34] Except, perhaps, in Barbadoes.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the factory (_ingenio_) and the farmers (_cañeros_)\r\nare not indissolubly connected. Their respective parts in the final\r\nproduct of the sugar industry are not invariable. The increase in the\r\nnumber of factories means an increase in the number of cane-buyers,\r\nand so tends to raise the price. During the years antecedent to 1895\r\nthe refineries improved their machinery, and their productive capacity\r\nincreased faster than the cultivated acreage. The price of the cane\r\nthen rose to about twenty piastres a ton. As this figure is far above\r\nthe net cost, the refineries endeavoured to profit themselves by the\r\nadvantages that accrued to the _cañeros_, and they bought land for\r\ncultivation. It is to this period that the big concerns of Cruz Alta\r\nbelong. Afterwards the production of cane increased, and nearly met\r\nthe demands of the refineries, so that their competition relaxed. They\r\nceased to buy land, and the price of cane was lowered.\r\n\r\nThe refineries now deal with cane which they grow themselves, with\r\npaid workers of their own; with cane that they buy at a reduced price\r\nfrom tenants (_colonos_), who grow it on their own estates; and with\r\ncane sold them by _cañeros_ who own their own fields. The range of the\r\ncountry absorbed by each refinery is often very extensive. The Sugar\r\nCongress of 1894 estimated that half the cane-harvest was transported\r\nby rail, and that freight from one canton to another in the sugar\r\ndistrict brought the railways more than a third of what they got for\r\nconveying sugar from Tucumán to the coast. Each railway company tries\r\nto keep along its own line the cane it carries to the refineries, so\r\nthat the transport of the sugar when it is made will fall to itself.\r\nThus the cane-market is divided into two separate compartments, with\r\nvery little exchange between them. The first comprises the zone that\r\ndepends on the Central Argentine and the State Railway; the second is\r\nthe zone of the Central Córdoba and the old local line bought by the\r\nCentral Córdoba.\r\n\r\nCertain parts, such as Cruz Alta and the district round the town, have\r\ntoo many works in proportion to their production of cane, and they are\r\ncentres of import. The price of the cane is always higher here than\r\nin the agricultural districts. Each works has its customers. At the\r\nstations it instals weighing machines for receiving and weighing the\r\ncane. It is only the more important _cañeros_ who have the privilege\r\nof selling by the truck-load, or selling to distant works. The small\r\ngrowers are compelled to deal with the local refinery. They sell it\r\ntheir canes direct, or, sometimes, through agents and dealers. In the\r\ndays when the works were competing for cane it became the custom to\r\nsign the purchase-contracts as early as possible; sometimes at the\r\nbeginning of October, as soon as the harvest of the year is over. In\r\norder to make sure of the loyalty of the _cañero_ the manufacturers\r\nadvance money to him, in proportion to their difficulty in getting cane.\r\n\r\n_Cañeros_ and mill-owners have had to work together to settle the\r\nproblem of labour. There was not enough at hand, and it had to be\r\nrecruited elsewhere. Agents were sent all round--to Catamarca and\r\nSantiago del Estero, and even to the province of Córdoba--to collect\r\nand bring gangs of workers. They were a mixed, unsteady, undisciplined\r\nlot. The owners of the works advanced them money in order to keep\r\nthem, and then, fearing to lose the money advanced, would not dismiss\r\nthem for laziness and irregularities. These troubles are not felt as\r\nmuch now as they were at the time when the industry was expanding.\r\nThe population of immigrant workers has settled down and taken root.\r\nBesides creoles it includes a small number of Italians and Spaniards;\r\nbut while the creoles have been definitely incorporated in the sugar\r\nindustry, the European immigrants use their savings to buy a bit of\r\nland and take to farming.\r\n\r\nIn normal times Tucumán has all the labour it requires, but the harvest\r\nalways compels it to seek help in other provinces. In May and June\r\nthe agents, well supplied with money, set out for the Salado, the\r\ndistricts round the Sierra d'Ancasti, etc. The temporary attraction of\r\nTucumán at this season is felt over a considerable distance. At Santa\r\nMaria, on the far side of Mount Aconcagua, 600 people--men, women,\r\nand children--emigrate for five months, and live on the cane-fields.\r\nThe merchants of Santa Maria make them advances, in the name of the\r\nrefiners, to the amount of about sixty piastres per worker. Further\r\nnorth the Tucumán _enganchadores_ come into collision with those from\r\nSalta and Campo Santo, and they divide the available labour between\r\nthem. Some of the temporary immigrants settle down permanently every\r\nyear, and swell the normal population of the sugar industry.\r\n\r\nOutside the Tucumán district an unfortunate attempt was made to plant\r\nthe sugar industry at Santiago del Estero, and large works were\r\nconstructed. But the frost is severe there. For some years they tried\r\nto keep the Santiago works going with cane brought from Tucumán, but\r\nthe freight was too heavy, and the works had to be abandoned, or else\r\ndismantled and set up elsewhere. The valley of the Rio Grande, from\r\nJujuy to 200 miles north of Tucumán, in the sub-Andean depression\r\nbetween the Sierra de Zenta and the Lumbrera, has, on the other hand,\r\nsuitable conditions for the cultivation of the cane. Frost is rare.\r\nThe climate is warmer than at Tucumán, the canes ripen more quickly,\r\nand the average return is higher. The water-supply also is good. There\r\nhave long been plantations in this region. Their first market was\r\nthe region of the tableland and the valleys, where they chiefly sold\r\nbrandy: a traffic of long standing, which one always finds round the\r\ncold districts of the Andes, from Colombia to the north of Argentina.\r\nThe modern refineries of Ledesma and San Pedro took the place of the\r\nprimitive mills as soon as the railway approached Jujuy, and even\r\nbefore it entered the valley of the Rio Grande. They then sent their\r\nsugar by waggon in November and December, between the close of the\r\nsugar season and the commencement of the rains, which spoil the roads.\r\n\r\nThe sugar district of Jujuy now has a very different economic\r\nand social organization from that of Tucumán. Here there are no\r\nfarmer-proprietors. Each centre is a large estate, in the midst of the\r\nforest, where the workers are lodged and fed by the works that employs\r\nthem. The contractors who clear the ground for them are obliged by\r\nthe terms of their contract to import their workers directly from the\r\nsouth, so that they will not take any away from the farming. There is\r\nno available labour, no free market, on the spot. Since the completion\r\nof the Quebrada de Humahuaca line, however, there has been a good deal\r\nof immigration, to settle or temporarily, of the mountaineers of the\r\ntableland. The sphere of influence of San Pedro now extends as far as\r\nBolivia. For the harvest, which, like that of Tucumán, requires a good\r\ndeal of additional manual labour, the works look to the wild Indians\r\nof the Chaco. This curious stream of seasonal migration, which the\r\nsugar campaign of Jujuy provokes every winter outside the zone of white\r\ncolonization, is of very old date, going back more than sixty years.\r\nBelmar notices it about the middle of the nineteenth century. The\r\nrecruiting agents of San Pedro and Ledesma set out from Embarcación,\r\nwhere the railway ends, and enter the Chaco, from which each of them\r\nbrings a troop of some hundreds of natives between March and June.\r\nThe number of these temporary immigrants seems to be about 6,000. The\r\nChiriguanos of the north leave their families on the Chaco, and the men\r\ncome alone. The Matacos immigrate in whole tribes. They camp in huts\r\nlike those of their own villages, under the shelter of the works, and\r\nare paid in maize, meat, and cigars. In October, when the _algarroba_\r\nflowers and makes them dream of their own country, they receive the\r\nremainder of their pay in money, and spend it in brandy, clothing,\r\nknives, and firearms.\r\n\r\nThe history of Mendoza resembles that of Tucumán in many ways. In the\r\nprovince of Cuyo, as at Tucumán, urban life has been precocious. In\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century Mendoza and San Juan exported\r\nwines, dried fruit (_pasas_ and _orejones_), and flour to the coast\r\nand to Paraguay. Part of the so-called \"Chilean flour\" consumed on the\r\nPampa, really came from Jachal and Mendoza. This trade ceased in the\r\nnineteenth century, but San Juan and Mendoza found another source of\r\nwealth in fattening cattle and sending them to Chile. Belmar, in 1856,\r\nestimates the extent of the lucerne farms of Cuyo to have been 150,000\r\n_cuadres_(440,000 acres).[35] As at Tucumán, the present period is\r\ncharacterized by a rapid expansion of cultivation and a rapid growth\r\nof population. But, whereas at Tucumán the neighbouring provinces\r\nhave provided the whole of the manual labour required, and the actual\r\npopulation is essentially creole, at Mendoza there has been a larger\r\nnumber of foreign immigrants. In 1914, foreigners were 310 per 1,000\r\nof the entire population of Mendoza: a larger proportion than for the\r\nwhole country. The immigrants going straight to Mendoza from the ports\r\nnumbered 12,000 in 1911, and 15,000 in 1912; almost as much as for the\r\nprovince of Santa Fé, and more than for the province of Córdoba. Thus\r\nMendoza plays a part of its own in the charm which Argentina has for\r\nthe imagination of Europe. When we examine a chart of the population\r\nof South America, we notice that the oases of Cuyo contain the only\r\nimportant groups of European population at any distance from the coast.\r\n\r\n     [35] A few convoys of cattle still use the Uspallata road,\r\n     especially over the Espinacito pass in the Cordillera de San\r\n     Juan.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of Mendoza to-day depends upon the cultivation of the\r\nvine, just as that of Tucumán depends upon sugar. The cultivation of\r\nthe vine is possible in the greater part of Argentina. In the early\r\ndays of colonization there were vineyards as far as the Paraguay.\r\nThey still flourish at Concordia on the Uruguay and at San Nicolas\r\non the lower Paraná. But the wet summers of the eastern provinces\r\nare not suitable for them. The climate for them improves as one goes\r\nwestward, and there is less rain. The dry zone of eastern Argentina\r\nis the special field of the vine. There it has spread over nearly\r\ntwenty degrees of latitude, and it depends, like other cultivation,\r\nupon irrigation. In the Andean valleys of the north-west it rises to\r\na height of 7,500 feet. South of Mendoza the higher limit of the vine\r\nsinks rapidly, and there are no vineyards in the mountainous district\r\nitself. On the other hand, its range increases; in the east it spreads\r\nas far as the Atlantic coast, in the valley of the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nThe former centres of viticulture in the north-west, in the oases\r\nof the _costas_ of La Rioja, Catamarca, and Salta, have scarcely\r\nbeen affected by the advance; and, in any case, their extent is very\r\nlimited. The vine-district of the Rio Negro is only in process of\r\ncreation, and its output is still small. Thus the area of production\r\non a large scale is limited to the three oases of San Juan, Mendoza,\r\nand San Rafaël, which in 1913 yielded 4,750,000 hectolitres, out\r\nof the total Argentine production of 5,000,000 hectolitres. These\r\nthree centres differ from each other to-day rather in their economic\r\ndevelopment than in their physical conditions. At San Juan, the\r\ntransformation of the earlier methods of production and the traditional\r\ncreole industries is only now taking place. At Mendoza it is quite\r\nfinished. The San Rafaël centre, on the other hand, is of recent\r\norigin; it was created on the site of a fortress which guarded the\r\nIndian frontier until 1880. Cultivated areas have appeared on virgin\r\nsoil, in the midst of the desert. These different circumstances account\r\nfor diversities which, though they will disappear in the course of\r\ntime, are still obvious to the traveller. The general scene is the\r\nsame everywhere. Arid and desolate mountains close the horizon in the\r\nwest; at their feet spreads the immense alluvial deposit on which the\r\nvineyards, surrounded by rows of poplars, grow wherever water is to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThere are so few gaps in the lower slopes of the Cordillera that the\r\navailable water is gathered at a small number of points. The Rio San\r\nJuan alone drains a belt of the Cordillera at least 140 miles broad.\r\nEach of the two oases, Mendoza and San Rafaël, has two streams of water\r\nto feed it. The Mendoza and the Tunuyan at Mendoza, and the Diamante\r\nand the Atuel at San Rafaël, approach each other, when they leave\r\nthe mountains, so closely that the estates they water blend into a\r\ncontinuous area. Then, however, instead of uniting, they diverge and\r\nare lost, separately, in the plain. These streams have less fall than\r\nthe thinner torrents of the oases of the north-west, and the average\r\ninclination of the dejection-cones which bear the vineyards is slight.\r\nThe upper slopes of the cone, where thin beds of clay lie upon shingle,\r\ngive clear wines of excellent aroma. Hence, in the Mendoza district,\r\nthe vineyards of Lujan and, further down, of Godoy Cruz, Guaymallen,\r\nand Maipu produce choice brands. On the plain, to the east of Mendoza,\r\nat San Martin and Junin, the harvest is larger, but the wine is rough,\r\nand one can often taste the saltpetre of the clayey soil. There is the\r\nsame difference between the upper and lower district at San Juan and\r\nSan Rafaël.\r\n\r\nThe oases of San Juan and San Rafaël spread evenly over the most\r\nsuitable parts of the alluvial talus, but the oasis of Mendoza has a\r\npeculiar shape which can only be explained by historical causes. The\r\ncultivated belt is a narrow strip along the Tunuyan, for more than\r\nsixty miles, as far as the heart of the plain, out of sight of the\r\nCordillera. It is one instance, out of a thousand, of the influence of\r\ntraffic on colonization. As a matter of fact, the road from Mendoza\r\nto the coast, by which the cattle convoys of San Luis went to the\r\n_invernadas_, passes along the Tunuyan. The estates grew up by the\r\nside of it. The villages of Santa Rosa, Las Catitas, and La Paz, which\r\nmark the various stages of it, are all of ancient origin. Strangers\r\nare rarely found there. One still sees in them very old houses, built\r\nbefore the railway was made, dating from the days of the _carril_ or\r\nwaggon-road. The importance of this line of water across the desert is\r\nclearly seen on the Woodbine Parish map.\r\n\r\nThe use of irrigation in this district raised different technical\r\nproblems from those of the north-western provinces. In this latitude\r\nthe torrents of the Andes are formidable when the snows melt, at the\r\nbeginning of summer. The flood is all the greater and more sudden as\r\nthe heat is late. From all the ravines of the mountains the muddy\r\nwaters then converge toward the valley. The flood scours the bed of\r\nthe river, erodes its banks, and threatens to find a way amongst the\r\nestates. Even the towns of Mendoza and San Juan have more than once\r\nbeen in danger. The fear of diverting the flood and of bringing it\r\nupon themselves compelled them to be content with raising only light\r\nand frail dams in the path of the torrent. At San Juan they used, for\r\na long time, the waters of the Arroyo del Estero, a small brook fed by\r\ninfiltration from the Valle de Zenda, and it was some time before they\r\nventured to draw upon the river itself.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE OASIS DEL RINCON, BELOW SAUJIL (ANDALGALA LINE,\r\n  PROVINCE OF CATAMARCA).\r\n  _The dejection-cone, at the foot of which is the very small oasis, is\r\n  seen resting against the Sierra d'Ambato._\r\n                                             Photograph by the Author.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MONTE AT EL YESO.\r\n  _Zone of clay hills at the foot of the Sierra de San Antonio, at\r\n  the edge of the Chaco.

To face p. 82.]\r\n\r\nAnother problem, which the smaller oases of the north-west hardly\r\nknow--the problem of drainage--is of paramount importance at San\r\nJuan and Mendoza, as far as a large part of the irrigated surface is\r\nconcerned. The water infiltrating into the soil forms a subterranean\r\nsheet which approaches more or less to the surface according to the\r\ntopography. It comes to the surface at the foot of the cone, where\r\nthe slope diminishes and the cone gradually passes into the plain.\r\nHence the cone has, at its base, a belt of marshes (_ciénagas_), and\r\nsometimes a line of good springs (_barbollon_). At San Juan, if you\r\nmove far enough away to get a comprehensive view of the whole of the\r\nestates, you see that they occupy the middle belt, half-way down the\r\ncone, the top of which is composed of coarse shingle, while the bottom\r\nis too wet. The advance of the plots upward and the steadily increasing\r\nuse of the available water tends to raise the level of the underground\r\nsheet and enlarge the area of marsh.\r\n\r\nThere is a fine black soil, very fertile when it is drained, and no\r\nirrigation is needed; as it is possible, according to the depth of the\r\ndrainage-trenches, to regulate the level of the underground water so\r\nas to make it reach and feed the roots. The draining of the marshes,\r\nagain, opens up a field for the further expansion of the estates,\r\nespecially at San Juan, where it has scarcely begun. Moreover, the\r\nwater that is obtained by draining the marshes enables them to create\r\nnew irrigated estates further on. At Mendoza there is already a\r\nconsiderable area irrigated by drainage-canals (_desagüe_).\r\n\r\nThe level of the water in the marshes sinks in the summer and rises\r\nin winter, at the time when the irrigation of the upper districts is\r\nsuspended or greatly reduced, and when the surplus of the _acequias_,\r\nwhich the fields no longer take, flows or infiltrates downward in any\r\nway that it can. Thus, contrary to the torrent itself, it is in winter\r\nthat the drainage-canals are at their fullest. At Barriales (Mendoza),\r\nand on the lower course of the Zanjon canal, thousands of acres,\r\nwatered by the drainage-canals and exposed to drought in the summer,\r\nhave the right to take water from the river or the canal during the\r\nthree summer months, from November to January. During the remainder of\r\nthe year they are restricted to the use of the drainage-canals. This\r\nsort of concession seems to provide a means of using the surplus of the\r\nriver during the summer.\r\n\r\nWith this exception there are no temporary rights limited to the\r\nhigh-water season and enabling them to raise quick crops, that ripen\r\nin a few months, round the area of perennials. At least, the expansion\r\nof the estates and the wish to use the full water-supply have led to\r\nthe creation of eventual rights, besides the definitive rights. They\r\ndo not come into play, theoretically, until the definitive rights\r\nhave had their full supply, and then only in a fixed order. They are\r\nsubordinated to the ordinary rights, and the market value of land with\r\neventual water-rights is much lower than that of land with definitive\r\nrights.[36] At San Rafaël, where colonization preceded the systematic\r\ninventory of the natural resources, the concession of eventual\r\nwater-rights was a means of facilitating the development of estates;\r\nthough they were very badly informed as to the surplus of the Atuel and\r\nthe Diamante and the area that the new land might cover.\r\n\r\n     [36] There are at present in the Mendoza province 275,000\r\n     hectares with a definitive right, and 303,000 with an eventual\r\n     right. The concessions fed by the Diamante and the Atuel at\r\n     San Rafaël, which amount to 120,000 hectares with a definitive\r\n     right and 150,000 with an eventual right, are not yet entirely\r\n     developed.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the co-existence of eventual and definitive rights\r\npresents many difficulties, and more than one pretext for fraud.\r\nSometimes the owners of eventual rights have access to the river\r\nhigher up than the older intakes, which ought to be served first. A\r\nwhole group of canals feeding land with eventual rights is in this\r\nway grafted upon the Tunuyan above La Paz, the rights of which are\r\ndefinitive and ancient.\r\n\r\nAt Mendoza and San Juan the water-rights, codified in provincial laws\r\nwhich date, like the dams, from the end of the nineteenth century, are\r\nvery different from the water-rights which hold in the Andean provinces\r\nof the north-west. The variety of the physical conditions is reflected\r\nin the institutions. Here water is not an object of private ownership\r\nindependently of the soil. The concession of water is assigned to a\r\ndefinite estate, and it is formulated in superficial measurements. The\r\nlaw fixes the volume of water that goes with each unit of surface.\r\nIf the output of the river is not large enough to provide the volume\r\nstated in the law to the whole of the irrigated district, all the\r\nlands with definitive rights receive at least an equal amount, and the\r\navailable water is shared by the canals in proportion to the extent of\r\nthe surface they irrigate.\r\n\r\nNo law could secure for the farmers of Cuyo, even those with definitive\r\nrights, a constant supply of water, or save them from suffering in\r\ncommon from the variation in the volume of the torrents, and it was not\r\neven possible to guarantee them water in any permanent fashion. The\r\n_turno_ is used everywhere when the water is low. Lower down, where the\r\ndrought lasts nearly the whole year, the _turno_ is the standing rule.\r\nAt La Paz, on the fringe of the irrigated area, it has to be applied\r\nrigorously. The turn of each owner comes every eight, ten, or twelve\r\ndays. In normal times he receives the _suerte de agua_; that is to say,\r\nthe output of a sluice of a fixed size during a half-hour for each\r\nhectare (a little over two acres) of land. But if the river runs low,\r\nit becomes impossible to supply several neighbours simultaneously, and,\r\nin order to avoid making the interval between supplies too long, the\r\nduration of the _suerte de agua_ is reduced by half or three-quarters.\r\n\r\nThe oases of Cuyo are like the small oases of the north-west as\r\nregards the function of those who are engaged in the administration of\r\nirrigation. The water-laws give the provincial functionaries general\r\ndirections. Below them, however, to arrange the distribution of the\r\nwater and the upkeep of the canals in detail, they have allowed to\r\nsurvive, and have merely regulated, certain primitive democratic\r\norganisms. At San Juan the superintendence of the irrigation is\r\nentrusted to elected municipal councils and the governor of the\r\ndepartment. At Mendoza, the owners appoint a council of three delegates\r\nand an inspector for each canal, and these settle the annual budget of\r\nthe canal, submit it to the provincial authorities, receive the taxes,\r\ncarry out the necessary repairs, and so on. The great subdivision of\r\nproperty and the large number of electors make these little republics\r\nvery lively; and they are very jealous of their autonomy.[37]\r\n\r\n     [37] There are more than 6,000 owners at San Juan to 91,000\r\n     hectares, and more than 9,000 at Mendoza (zone of the rivers\r\n     Mendoza and Tunuyan) to 130,000 hectares (statistics compiled\r\n     in 1899).\r\n\r\nEven within the narrow limits of the Cuyo district the climatological\r\nconditions, which control the growth of the vine, are not everywhere\r\nthe same. The opening of the vineyards varies by several weeks,\r\naccording to the locality.[38] The northern slope of the cone, exposed\r\nto the sun and protected from the southern winds, is more precocious.\r\nSome districts, poorly sheltered from the southern winds, and very\r\nliable to have late frost, have not been planted with vines (district\r\nof the Tucuyan below San Carlos, to the south of Mendoza). Everywhere\r\nthe dryness of the atmosphere causes the ripe grapes to remain long\r\non the vine, so that the harvest may last two months or more without\r\nany harm. It thus requires a relatively small supplement of manual\r\nlabour, and does not necessitate seasonal migrations. The length of the\r\nharvest, moreover, facilitates the trade in grapes, which is one of the\r\nspecial features of the Argentine vine-industry.\r\n\r\n     [38] The difference is much greater at a distance from the\r\n     Cuyo province. Catamarca, which specializes in the production\r\n     of grapes for the table, is invaded by buyers from Buenos\r\n     Aires, and begins to send grapes in December, two full months\r\n     before the harvest begins in Mendoza.\r\n\r\nThe climate is not so suitable for making wine as it is for growing\r\nvines. The temperature is high at the time of the harvest, and it\r\nretards fermentation in the cellars. The grapes have too much sugar\r\nand too little acid for the transformation of the must to proceed of\r\nitself. Hence it is necessary to have an expensive equipment, improved\r\ncellars, and skilled workers. This industrial organization is beyond\r\nthe reach of the small cultivators. The cultivation of the vine and\r\nthe making of wine are, therefore, not always associated. They are\r\ntaken up by two different classes of the population. Tucumán has its\r\n_cañeros_ and factories, and Mendoza, by a division of labour which\r\nseems to the European visitor as strange as the climate which partly\r\nexplains it, has its vine-growers (_viñateros_) and its manufactures\r\n(_bodegueros_).[39]\r\n\r\n     [39] While the cultivation of the cane has, for the most part,\r\n     become dependent upon the sugar industry, which represents\r\n     large capital, wine-making is, on the contrary, usually\r\n     regarded as merely an annex of wine-growing.\r\n\r\nEach of these two classes has had its share in the common work. The\r\n_viñatores_ have created the vineyard. The creole vine, imported into\r\nPeru from the Canaries and spreading over the whole of the southern\r\nAndes, yields great quantities of a sugary, but rough fruit, which\r\ndoes not lend itself to imitating the wines of Europe. At Mendoza it\r\nhas almost entirely disappeared, though it survives at San Juan. It\r\nis grown on trellis-work, wooden frames resting on forked branches of\r\n_algarroba_; though sometimes the strong stems rise without support to\r\na height of about six feet and are crowned with shoots and leaves. The\r\nnew vine has been grown from French cuttings. While the creole vines\r\nlook like orchards, the French vines are grown in rows of iron wire.\r\n\r\nThe plantations were first made by creole workmen, who were paid by\r\nthe day. Afterwards, as immigration from Europe increased, long-term\r\ncontracts came into vogue, in virtue of which the colonist received\r\nthe bare land and undertook to have it planted with vines at the end\r\nof three, four, or five years. The owner supplied the material, and\r\nat the end of the contract the colonist received a few _centavos_ for\r\neach vine, or sold the whole or part of the first harvest. On account\r\nof these contracts there were always a great many foreigners in the\r\ndistricts where vineyards were in course of formation. The proportion\r\nis now less at Mendoza than at San Rafaël, where colonization is more\r\nrecent. Whenever they could, the owners left to the colonists, not only\r\nthe business of planting the vines, but the upkeep of adult vineyards.\r\nIn those cases the colonist receives a fixed sum per hectare (100\r\npiastres, for instance), and has to dig, prune, irrigate, etc. A large\r\nnumber of these agricultural workers and small contractors have saved a\r\nsmall capital, and purchased land of their own. This they have planted,\r\nand they thus form a new class of working owners.\r\n\r\nWhile the _viñatores_ were multiplying vineyards, the _bodegueros_ were\r\ntransforming the methods of making wine. The weakness of imperfectly\r\nfermented wines, which turn sour and evaporate quickly, was all the\r\nworse for the growers of the colonial period because transport was\r\nslow, and there was no protection against the sun, which cooked the\r\n_algarroba_ casks or the leather bottles on the backs of the mules.\r\nThe vineyard-owners often preferred to distil their wine and export\r\nbrandy, flavoured with aniseed, to the Andean tablelands or the coast.\r\nThe climate and the risks of transport had brought into existence an\r\nastonishing variety of methods of treating the must. Sometimes it was\r\nconcentrated by boiling until it became a thick syrup (_arrope_),\r\nsomething like, apparently, the thick wines of the Mediterranean in\r\nformer times. At other times the must was cooked without thickening\r\nit, to prevent immediate fermentation, as is done with the _chicha_ in\r\nChile to-day; or sour wines were mixed with boiled must and ashes of\r\nthe shoots, which masked the acidity.\r\n\r\nThese traditions are now lost, but it is curious to see the\r\n_bodegueros_ still endeavouring to meet the taste of the creole\r\npopulation of the north-west, which has retained the preference for\r\nsweet and fruity wines. San Juan, which caters to these customers,\r\nmanufactures _mistelas_--fresh boiled must with an addition of\r\nalcohol--which are mixed with mature wines in order the imitate the\r\nimperfect fermentation of earlier days. Perhaps there is no part of\r\nthe world where the art of wine-making has been pushed so far as in\r\nthe _bodegas_ of Mendoza. The correction of the must, and the analysis\r\nand treatment of diseased wines, follow the most modern of methods.\r\nThe _bodegas_ produce a very steady wine, which is guaranteed by their\r\ntrade marks. The wine of the Mendoza type, which they endeavour to\r\nproduce, is a strong red wine, of heavy colour, with twelve or thirteen\r\nper cent. of alcohol. It may euphemistically be called a blended wine,\r\nbut is in reality diluted wine. Argentina does not produce very light\r\nwines, and has no use for diluted wine.\r\n\r\nThe number of wine-making cellars in 1913 was 997 at Mendoza and 336\r\nat San Juan. But they differ very much from each other in size. Most\r\nof them have only a small equipment and modest capital. Some, on the\r\nother hand, are large enterprizes which could produce enough to supply\r\na city: vast constructions of brick or _adobe_, with light roofs as a\r\nprecaution against earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe owners of the cellars almost always have their own vineyards, but\r\nthey also buy the harvests of cultivators who have not cellars. In 1908\r\nit was calculated that 140,000 tons of grapes were sent to the press\r\nby the owners and 175,000 tons bought by the _bodegueros_.[40]\r\n\r\n     [40] More recent statistics are not to hand. The proportion\r\n     differs a little every year according to the prices of wine\r\n     and grapes.\r\n\r\nThe conflicts of the interests of the _viñateros_ and the _bodegueros_\r\nare the very woof of life at Mendoza. The price of grapes is infinitely\r\nmore variable than that of wine, and the _viñatero_ who has no cellar\r\nis at the mercy of the _bodeguero_. If he does not want to see his\r\nharvest go to waste, he has to accept unconditionally the price that is\r\noffered him. The _bodeguero_ has, moreover, the advantage of disposing\r\nof the grapes grown on his own estates. If the circumstances do not\r\nencourage him to produce all he can, he sends to the press merely\r\nhis own harvest and will not buy any other. Thus the whole burden of\r\ncommercial crises falls upon the vineyard with no cellar.\r\n\r\nThe prices paid for the grapes differ a little for different parts\r\nof the vineyard, but the variation is more due to the number of\r\n_bodegas_ in the district and their capacity than to the quality\r\nof the grapes. Transport of the grapes to a great distance is very\r\nexpensive. In exceptional times grapes have been brought from San\r\nRafaël to the Mendoza cellars, but each _bodega_ gets its supply as\r\nfar as possible from its own district. At San Juan the capacity of the\r\ncellars is proportionately less than at Mendoza, and the _bodegueros_\r\nhave imposed very hard conditions on the growers. The price fixed in\r\nthe purchase-contract does not of itself give a complete idea of the\r\nbenefits which the _bodeguero_ enjoys. The grapes are purchased by\r\nweight, but the _bodeguero_ reserves the right to say at what date\r\nthey are to be delivered. He begins to harvest his own vines when the\r\nfruit is scarcely ripe, but he puts back the harvesting of the grapes\r\nhe buys as far as possible, even to April or May. These grapes exposed\r\non the plant to the heat of the sun, become overripe; they gain in\r\nsugar and lose in weight. They make wines with a higher percentage of\r\nalcohol, and with these he can correct the lighter wines made during\r\nthe preceding weeks. Finally, the _bodeguero_ does not advance money to\r\nthe _viñatero_, as the manufacturer does to the _cañero_ in the sugar\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe only safeguard of the vine-growers is the lack of understanding\r\nbetween the _bodegueros_ and the competition between them. Although\r\nthere are conventions amongst the _bodegueros_ which lay down\r\nofficially, before the vintage, the basis of all transactions, they\r\nare not respected except in so far as they serve a man's interest.\r\nIf it is expected that the wine will easily be sold, and that grapes\r\nwill be short, buyers are abundant, and contracts are signed before\r\nthe fruit appears. It is a sort of gamble, as in the case of wheat and\r\ncotton. Bulls and bears struggle for the market. If the bulls win, the\r\n_viñateros_ grow rich.[41]\r\n\r\n     [41] Besides the causes of a geographical nature which I have\r\n     indicated, the separation of cultivation from wine-making has\r\n     other economic grounds, but they do not fall within the range\r\n     of this book. The large _bodega_ is better situated than the\r\n     small cultivator for organizing the sale of his wines on the\r\n     distant market of Buenos Aires. Also, the _bodegueros_ alone\r\n     are able to meet the competition of Buenos Aires merchants who\r\n     import European wines and make adulterated wines.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the diagrams which show the production of wine and\r\nsugar in Argentina during the last thirty years, we see that they\r\nclearly illustrate the condition of dependence of the vineyard industry\r\nand the sugar industry as regards the home market. The prosperity of\r\nthe region of the Pampas, especially during the years before 1914,\r\nis reflected at Mendoza and Tucumán. The expansive movement of the\r\nestates is similarly bound up with the construction of railways to\r\nconnect them with the coast. Industry, on a large scale, began at\r\nTucumán in 1876: that is to say, at the opening of the Central Córdoba\r\nline. The area planted with cane rose from 2,200 hectares in 1876 to\r\n14,800 in 1886. The production of sugar was trebled in four years,\r\nfrom 1876 to 1880. But the Central Córdoba was a narrow-gauge line,\r\nexpensive to use and necessitating a transfer of goods at Córdoba. In\r\n1891 the broad-gauge line from Buenos Aires to Rosario was extended to\r\nTucumán; and in 1892 the narrow-gauge line from Rosario to Santa Fé,\r\nSan Cristobal, and Tucumán was also brought into use. The following\r\nyears were marked by rapid advances of the sugar industry. From 1891 to\r\n1895 the area planted with canes rose from 14,200 to 40,700 hectares,\r\nand the manufacture of sugar from 31,000 to 135,000 tons. At Mendoza,\r\nalso, the development of the vineyards dates from the completion of the\r\nSan Luis Railway in 1885. Plantations were at once started, and three\r\nyears later they came into touch. In 1887, the railway carried 27,000\r\nhectolitres of wine from Mendoza to the coast; in 1890-91 it carried\r\n268,000 hectolitres. Production had increased tenfold in that short\r\nspace of time.\r\n\r\nAs the home-production of wine and sugar increased, the imports from\r\nabroad fell. As early as 1885 Tucumán was able to meet the home demand\r\nfor raw sugar, and refined only was imported. In 1888, a refinery was\r\nerected at Rosario to deal with Argentine sugar which came by rail,\r\nand foreign sugar which came up the river. Import ceased at this date,\r\nor there have since only been occasional years of import, to meet a\r\nscarcity. The imports of ordinary foreign wines continued to increase\r\nuntil 1890 (800,000 hectolitres), or as long as the wine produced at\r\nMendoza did not suffice to meet the demand. They have steadily declined\r\nsince that date (350,000 hectolitres in 1913), and are now only seven\r\nper cent. of the national production. We should add that, even in\r\nregard to ordinary wines, the Mendoza and the imported wine are not\r\nstrictly comparable, that the competition between them is not simply\r\na matter of price, and that some customers continue to prefer foreign\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A VINEYARD AT SAN JUAN.\r\n  _Trellissed creole vines._\r\n                                    Photograph by Boote, Buenos Aires.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A VINEYARD AT MENDOZA.\r\n  _French vines on wire.

To face p. 92.]\r\n\r\nThe elimination of foreign wines and sugar and the development of\r\nMendoza and Tucumán were facilitated by a Protectionist tariff. The\r\ndetails of this are very curious, as they had to be adjusted to the\r\nnatural conditions. The need of protection is chiefly due to the\r\ndistance of the market from the productive centres. Mendoza is 650\r\nmiles from Buenos Aires, Tucumán more than 750 miles. Freightage\r\non the railways is dear. It is thirty-five piastres a ton for wine\r\nbetween Mendoza and Buenos Aires, or nearly double the normal maritime\r\nfreight for the European wines sent from Bordeaux or Genoa. The charge\r\nfor sugar is about thirty piastres a ton between Tucumán and Buenos\r\nAires. Thus the cost of transport is nearly one sixth the entire cost\r\nof production. In spite of this common burden, the need of protection\r\nis not at all the same in Mendoza and Tucumán. The climate of Mendoza\r\nis excellent for the vine. The dryness of the atmosphere keeps down\r\ncryptogamic diseases, and the risks of cultivation are slight. The crop\r\nis abundant, the frosts late, and not serious. Hail is frequent, it is\r\ntrue, at the mouths of the Cordillera valleys, but it is never general;\r\nit affects only a small part of the harvest. The curve of production\r\nis very regular. It rises every year very gradually, and in proportion\r\nto the increase of the cultivated area. As a result of all this, the\r\nwine market has a stability which the vine-growing countries of Europe,\r\nwith their less reliable climate, do not enjoy. The protective tariff,\r\ntherefore, remains fixed. The duty on foreign wines in the cask--eight\r\ncentimes (gold) per litre--has not been altered since the introduction\r\ninto Argentina of the wine-industry on a large scale.[42]\r\n\r\n     [42] Mendoza is further protected by law against fraud.\r\n     This legislation is partly national and partly provincial.\r\n     The national law, which takes into account the interests of\r\n     the merchants of Buenos Aires, permits the manufacture of\r\n     artificial wines. The provincial law, in the special interests\r\n     of the productive districts, is more stringent. It prohibits\r\n     the manufacture of artificial wines. It also fixes the minimum\r\n     percentage of alcohol, and prevents the dispatch from Mendoza\r\n     to Buenos Aires of alcoholic wines to mix with must. Finally,\r\n     it defends the _viñatero_ against the _bodeguero_ by fixing\r\n     the quantity of grapes to be used in making a hectolitre of\r\n     wine and so prevents fraud at the _bodega_.\r\n\r\nThe curve of sugar-production is just as irregular as that of\r\nwine-production is regular. From one year to another the output may\r\nvary by as much as 100 per cent., and the changes cannot be predicted:\r\n147,000 tons in 1912, 335,000 tons in 1914, 150,000 tons in 1915. The\r\nreason is that the sugar output depends upon the season. Canes which\r\nhave been touched by frost go sour and ferment in the ground. They\r\nhave to be milled quickly, and the harvest must not be prolonged. Even\r\nin good years the costly equipment of the works is active during only\r\nthree months (July to September, but at Jujuy, July to October).\r\n\r\nThis irregularity of production, which makes protection inevitable,\r\nalso complicates it infinitely in practice. Sometimes the harvest\r\nis not large enough to meet home demands, and imports have to be\r\npermitted. Sometimes production is far beyond the home demand, and\r\nthe sugar-manufacturers have to export the surplus so as to prevent\r\na slump in prices on the overloaded home market. In order to meet\r\nthese very different situations, the protecting tariff has had to be\r\nrepeatedly modified and complicated. But it is impossible for us to\r\ngive the history of it in detail here. The duties on foreign sugar were\r\nfixed, in successive instalments, between 1883 and 1891; and special\r\nprotective measures were taken in the interest of the refiners in 1888.\r\nOver-production appeared for the first time in 1895. Export at a loss,\r\nto relieve the home market, was at first organized by an association\r\nof the producers themselves (in 1896). But in 1897 the Government\r\ndeveloped it by putting a premium on export. The export period lasted\r\nfrom 1897 to 1904. The law of 1912, which gives its latest form to\r\nthe Protectionist regime, gives the Government the right to suspend\r\nfor a time the duties on imports and allow foreign sugar to come in.\r\nAs at Mendoza, the provincial Government intervenes as well as the\r\nnational. The alternation of bad and exceptionally good harvests leads\r\nto the appearance of all sorts of unforeseen laws, modifying the bases\r\nof taxation, regulating production in the works, and restricting the\r\nacreage of cultivation.[43] Thus Tucumán has lived in an atmosphere of\r\nstorm and uncertainty and unceasing discussion, of discouragement and\r\ninsecurity; the price of its geographical position at the extreme limit\r\nof the area in which cane can be grown.\r\n\r\n     [43] Especially during the crisis of 1902-3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE EXPLOITATION OF THE FORESTS\r\n\r\n     Manual labour on the _obrajes_--The land of the _bañados_\r\n     and the agricultural cantons of Corrientes--The timber-yards\r\n     of the Chaco and the tannic-acid works of the Paraná--The\r\n     exploitation of the _maté_--The forestry industry and\r\n     colonization.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Andes of Tucumán and Salta to the banks of the upper Paraná\r\nin the province of Misiones the north of Argentina is now a vast\r\ntimber-yard for the exploitation of the forests. It resounds everywhere\r\nwith the axe. This exploitation of the forest is of early origin on\r\nthe river; in the eighteenth century Buenos Aires was supplied with\r\nwood from the Paraná. In the western Chaco the difficulty of transport\r\nby land retarded the development of the forestry industry. The only\r\nmarket for the timber of Tucumán was the Andean region. It was not sent\r\nto Mendoza after the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the\r\nwillow was acclimatized in the oases of Cuyo. Below Rosas the wood of\r\nthe _quebracho_ was at first taken in waggons from Santiago to Buenos\r\nAires, but this traffic ceased when the river-route was reopened,\r\nand we do not find it resumed until recent times, when railways were\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nThe outer fringe of the forest and the scrub where the industry has\r\nhad to find labour, is inhabited by a very sparse pastoral population.\r\nThere are, however, besides the thinly populated districts of the\r\nfarms, certain busy hives which lend animation to the scrub. These\r\nover-populated cantons are districts of cultivation by _bañados_, or\r\nthe cultivation of flood-lands. There is constant intercourse between\r\nthese ancient centres of creole life and the timber-yards of the\r\nforest. The forestry industry recruits its workers there, on temporary\r\ncontracts. The wages paid are brought back to these centres and spent\r\nthere. They help to maintain social groups of an archaic type, which\r\nthe meagreness of their production would otherwise doom to extinction.\r\n\r\nThe _bañados_ are scattered over the range of all the sierras within\r\nthe limits reached by the torrents from the mountains before they are\r\nlost. They also stretch along the two rivers that are considerable\r\nenough to cross the scrub, the Salado and the Dulce. The course of\r\nthe Bermejo, where the natural conditions are much the same, lies\r\noutside the sphere of primitive creole colonization. The tilled lands\r\nare not continuous on the Salado or the Dulce. There are no _bañados_\r\nwherever the bed of the river is enclosed by high banks which prevent\r\nflooding. The course of the Salado threads together, in the manner of\r\na rosary, three main groups of _bañados_ below 26° S. lat., (Matoque\r\nand Boqueron) between 27° and 28° S. lat. (Brea), and between 28° and\r\n29° S. lat. (Le Bracho and Navicha). But the classic country of the\r\n_bañados_, where they cover the widest extent and sustain the most\r\nconsiderable body of population, is the interior delta of the Rio Dulce\r\nbelow Santiago del Estero, in the departments of Loreto, Atamisqui, and\r\nSalavina.\r\n\r\nSantiago is situated almost at the top of it. In its upper part the\r\nRio Dulce is enclosed between high clay cliffs (department of the Rio\r\nHondo). Below Santiago the river seems to run to the top of a sort\r\nof flattened alluvial cone, over which it wanders. Instances of the\r\nmigration of rivers during the historical period are plentiful in the\r\nnorth of the Argentine plain. The scrub is scored east of the Salado\r\nwith a network of dry beds, the edges of which gradually disappear as\r\nthe vegetation extends over them. But there is no other part where\r\nthe erratic nature of the waters is so marked, the vagabondage so\r\nconsiderable, as in this section of the basin of the Rio Dulce. The\r\nsmall towns of Atamisqui and Salavina, which lived on the waters of the\r\nDulce, were suddenly ruined in 1825, when the river, in consequence\r\nof a particularly violent flood, turned away to the south and lost\r\nitself in the Salinas Grandes. A canal was dug in 1897 to irrigate the\r\ndistrict of Loreto, on the left bank of the Dulce, but the entrance\r\nwas badly protected, and the flood of 1901 swept into it, and, guided\r\nby it, reached the bed it had abandoned a century before, going\r\nsouth-eastward toward Atamisqui. That town and Salavina recovered their\r\nprosperity, while it was necessary to abandon the farms on the Rio des\r\nSalines, which now has water only during high floods. Actual beds, old\r\nbeds that are always ready to serve again, and traces of canals changed\r\nand cut by the stream, form a great network in the midst of the plain;\r\nand the flood rolls to one side or the other according to the road open\r\nto it, and the facility with which the various elements of the network\r\nlend themselves to the passage of the water. Such is the land of the\r\n_bañados_.\r\n\r\nYou enter it to-day at Loreto station, where the line from Santiago\r\nto Frias approaches within a few miles of it. This station is erected\r\nin the midst of the arid _monte_, and owes its existence to the\r\nneighbouring _bañados_. Turning eastward from the railway, as soon\r\nas one has crossed the broad, sandy bed of the Rio des Salines, one\r\nfinds oneself in the heart of the _bañados_ farms. The road passes\r\nbetween hedges (_cercas_), over the top of which one sees the green of\r\nthe wheat and lucerne. The plots are very small: gardens rather than\r\nfields. In clearing the ground they have preserved the best-situated\r\ntrees, and the light foliage gives a useful shade to the crops. The\r\ncrown of the _algarrobas_ rises everywhere above the top of the hedges.\r\n\r\nThe fields do not cover the whole area of the annual inundations.\r\nThey are confined to the part where the flood is fertilizing; where\r\nit leaves behind it a fine, useful clay which keeps the store of\r\nmoisture for several months. In other places the current is too rapid.\r\nIt furrows the soil, leaves large holes in it like the _lônes_ in the\r\nflood-area of the Rhone, and sweeps away the barriers; or the water\r\nbrings sterile sand which it deposits in long stretches; or again, if\r\nit is not drained away in time and evaporates on the spot, it deposits\r\nthe salts it contains, and the land, looking as if it had a white\r\nleprosy, becomes unfit for vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe floods begin in summer, during November or December. They are\r\ncaused by the rain-storms in the Tucumán district, and are very\r\nirregular. Some of the houses are evacuated, and others are protected\r\nby walls of earth, which are raised from hour to hour according to the\r\nrise of the waters. Behind these walls the people await the abatement\r\nof the flood. When the mud which is left behind has the proper\r\nconsistency, they till it and sow wheat. The wheat grows in the winter,\r\nand is harvested in November quickly, so that the fresh flood may not\r\novertake it.\r\n\r\nThe caprices of the flood compel them frequently to change the sites of\r\ntheir houses and fields. The ancient village of Loreto was evacuated\r\nafter a flood, and is now merely a mass of deserted ruins. Round the\r\nnaked trunks of the _algarrobas_, killed by excessive deposits of\r\nsand or salt, are uniform colonies of plants of the same age and the\r\nsame species, which invade the area where the adult scrub has been\r\ndestroyed. The mill has been rebuilt less than a mile away, and has not\r\nlost its customers, who have raised their _ranchos_ some distance away.\r\nThe insecurity of the plots has prevented the development of small\r\nownership. The farmers are tenants of the ranches, which stretch from\r\nthe river to a considerable distance in the interior.\r\n\r\nThe use of _bañados_ for agriculture is of long standing. It probably\r\ngoes back to the pre-Columbian period. Father Dobritzhoffer, who\r\nis the first to refer clearly to it, compares the Rio Dulce to the\r\nNile[44]; and in point of fact, the _bañados_ have some resemblance\r\nto farming in Pharaonic Egypt, while there is nothing like them in\r\nthe irrigated zones of the Andean valleys. The _bañados_ were then\r\ndevoted to the cultivation of wheat and pumpkins. The pumpkin, which\r\nis of American origin, had not yet been eliminated by wheat, which\r\nwas introduced by the Spaniards. The wheat produced in the _bañados_\r\nmaintained a fairly active export trade at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, and the _bañados_ were at times called, with some\r\nexaggeration, the \"granary of the Vice-royalty.\" It is difficult to\r\ntrace accurately the movements of the population of the _bañados_\r\nbecause of the constant changes of the administrative areas in the\r\nprovince of Santiago. The total population of the province is not now\r\nmore than three per cent. of the total population of Argentina, but its\r\ncomparative importance was much greater in the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury (nearly eight per cent. at the census of 1861). The departments\r\nof Loreto, Atamisqui, and Salavina on the Rio Dulce, which live mainly\r\non the estates of the _bañados_, comprised 46,000 inhabitants in 1861,\r\nand only 43,000 in 1895. The Woodbine Parish map and Hutchinson's\r\ndescription clearly give one an impression of a dense population in the\r\narea of the _bañados_. I refer elsewhere to the antiquity and constancy\r\nof the streams of temporary immigration which spread the population of\r\nthe _bañados_ over a large part of the territory of Argentina.[45] The\r\ntemporary emigration of the Santiagueños is distributed amongst most\r\nof the provinces of central and northern Argentina, but it is chiefly\r\nof interest in connection with the frontier region. The Santiagueño is\r\na woodman above all else, and the forest area has the advantage over\r\nthe other labour-markets of wanting workers at all seasons, summer or\r\nwinter, whereas the sugar-cane harvest at Tucumán and the harvest in\r\nthe south only last a few months. They emigrate from the _bañados_\r\nto Tucumán in May; to Córdoba and Santa Fé in October, November and\r\nDecember; but to the forests of the Chaco all the year round.\r\n\r\n     [44] _Historia de Abiponibus._\r\n\r\n     [45] See the chapter on population.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE LAND OF THE BAÑADOS.\r\n  _On the Rio Dulce, near Loreto, in the dry season. Its actual bed,\r\n  excavated at a recent date by a flood in soft clay, is not yet\r\n  stable._\r\n                                             Photograph by the Author.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LORETO: FARMING BY INUNDATION.\r\n  _In the zone of the scrub, where the floods of the Rio Dulce spread.\r\n  The interior delta of the Rio Dulce is one of the earliest centres of\r\n  population in Argentina._                   Photograph by the Author.\r\n  PLATE IX.                                            To face p. 100.]\r\n\r\nApart from the _bañados_ of the Dulce and the Salado, the province of\r\nCorrientes contains the main reservoir from which the timber industry\r\ndrew its manual workers. Just as at Santiago del Estero, one finds\r\nat Corrientes also the opposition between agricultural and breeding\r\ndistricts which is so common in the older colonized regions of South\r\nAmerica. The _estancieros_ (ranchers), who are breeders, are the\r\nmasters of Corrientes, but the line of low hills of sand and red\r\nclay, punctuated by lagoons, which crosses the north-western corner\r\nof the province, is not subject to their domination. There the land\r\nis subdivided; there are once more fields. Tobacco was an article of\r\nexport for this fraction of Corrientes, especially after the political\r\nisolation of Paraguay, the chief producer of tobacco in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. During the whole of the first half of the nineteenth century\r\nthe tobacco-buyers travelled all over Corrientes after the harvest, in\r\nJanuary and February. The fertile soil, moreover, with a mild climate\r\nin which tropical plants flourish as well as those of the temperate\r\nzone, provides the elements of a local comfort which is complete in\r\nitself. Here again agricultural colonization has created a relatively\r\ndense nucleus of population, capable of great increase. Although the\r\nadministrative divisions do not exactly correspond with the natural\r\ndivisions, the unequal distribution of the population in Corrientes\r\nis made plain by the figures given in the census of 1895. The density\r\nrises in the agricultural areas to eight inhabitants per square\r\nkilometre, in the department of Bellavista; ten at San Cosma; fourteen\r\nat Lomas; thirty at San Roque. It is only between one and two in the\r\npurely pastoral departments (Concepción and Mercedes).\r\n\r\nCorrientes also has its forests, and in these we find most of the\r\nspecies of the forests of the Chaco, in straight lines, along the\r\nwater-courses, and in somewhat larger patches on the tablelands which\r\nseparate the lower valleys near the Paraná. They at first supplied the\r\nCurupai bark which was used in the Corrientes tanneries. The yards for\r\nthe construction of river-boats emigrated from Paraguay to Corrientes\r\nat the beginning of the nineteenth century, at the same time and for\r\nthe same reasons as the tobacco trade. The exploiting of the red\r\n_quebracho_ did not begin until about 1850. In 1887 Virasoro relates\r\nthat fifty ships are engaged in loading with Nandubai timber on the\r\nbanks of the Rio Corrientes and transporting it to Rosario.[46] Born on\r\nthe left bank of the Paraná, the forestry industry emigrated toward the\r\nend of the century to the right bank, whither the workers of Corrientes\r\nfollowed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [46] Val. Virasoro, \"Los esteros y lagunas del Ibera\" in _Bol.\r\n     Instit. Geog. Argent._ (vi. 1887; pp. 305-31).\r\n\r\nWe find the same movement further north, on the Paraguay. The\r\nexploitation of the woods is in that case a very old industry on\r\nthe tributaries of the left bank. D'Azara draws attention to its\r\nimportance.[47] Robertson found, when he went from Corrientes to\r\nAsunción in 1814, a population of wood-cutters in the marshy belt near\r\nthe river. During floods they took refuge in the agricultural cantons\r\nof the frontier on high ground, where they were well received. It\r\nseems, then, that wood-cutting was already a seasonal industry at this\r\ntime. The exploitation of the forests is now rapidly invading the right\r\nbank, which was long abandoned to the wild Indians.\r\n\r\n     [47] _Diario de la navegacion y reconocimiento del Rio\r\n     Tibicuari_ (Coll. de Angelis, vol. ii.).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Santiagueños and Correntinos do not mix. The two zones of expansion\r\nand of forestry, of which they are the pioneers, are independent of\r\neach other. The _quechua_, which is the language of the _bañados_ of\r\nthe Rio Dulce, is spoken in the timber-yards of the Chaco de Santiago;\r\nthe _guarani_, the language of Corrientes and the Paraguay, is most\r\ncommon along the river, in the Chaco de Santa Fé. Their respective\r\nspheres will not come into touch with each other until the Quimili\r\nbranch of the Central Norte Railway, which comes from the Santiago\r\nprovince, joins the line of penetration at Resistencia, on the Paraná,\r\nin the west.\r\n\r\nThe forestry industry of the interior and that of the river-districts\r\ndiffer not only in the character of the workers, but in their\r\norganization and their market. The variety of red _quebracho_ which\r\nis exploited in the west is not quite the same as the variety that is\r\nfound in the east. Each has a name of its own--_quebracho santiagueño_\r\nand _quebracho chaqueño_. The former contains ten per cent. of tannin,\r\nthe latter thirty per cent. The former is cut down for timber, the\r\nlatter in order to extract the tannic acid. The one is sold in\r\nArgentina, and the other sent abroad.\r\n\r\nThe working of the timber at Santiago has remained in the hands of a\r\nnumber of small capitalists and contractors who do not own the land\r\nand do not work there. They are content to buy in small amounts and\r\naccording to the demand at the moment, the right to exploit the forests\r\n(_derecho de monte or derecho de leña_). The trunks of exceptionally\r\nlarge _quebracho_ provide logs that are sold by cubic measurement, but\r\nthe district of the _quebracho santiagueño_ mainly exports sleepers.\r\n_Quebracho_ sleepers have been used in constructing the railways, both\r\nnarrow and broad gauge, during the last twenty years on the Pampa.\r\nTall and thin trees make telegraph posts; the smaller branches make\r\nstakes for wire fences. In parts of the bush where there is no red\r\n_quebracho_, the _retamo_ is used, to make posts for enclosures, and\r\nalso the white _quebracho_, which is sold in round logs. Finally,\r\nthe forests provide wood for fuel. The works at Tucumán, and the\r\nlocomotives over a good part of the land, use wood-fuel. The wood of\r\nthe red _quebracho_, if left for some years in the yards where the\r\nsleepers are made and is rid of the sap-wood, which rots and falls\r\nout--the _leña campana_--is excellent fuel. Charcoal is cheaper to\r\ntransport than the wood, and can therefore be sent farther over the\r\nwhole prairie district. It is made in the _monte_, along all the\r\nrailways, and especially in the thinner forests on the edge of the\r\nprairie.\r\n\r\nThe forestry of the interior is unstable as well as scattered and\r\nprimitive. The equipment--saws that are easily taken down and set\r\nup--is not costly, and does not require much capital. When one canton\r\nof the forest has been exhausted, the saws are taken down and removed.\r\nThe cuttings are not made in such a way as to allow the forest to\r\nrecover, and so permit a continuous exploitation. Everything of any\r\nvalue is taken. The _quebracho_ is, moreover, a tree of slow growth.\r\nThe forestry industry has at times returned, after an interval, to land\r\nthat had been stripped, but that is not because they had planted a new\r\ngeneration of trees. It is because it became profitable, as the state\r\nof the market and the cost of transport changed, to cut down the small\r\ntrees which had not been considered good enough on the earlier occasion.\r\n\r\nWhen the master _obrajero_ removes, he is followed by the greater part\r\nof the workers. But to induce them to emigrate, or to recruit cutters\r\nin the _bañados_ who will agree to work in remote or new districts,\r\nhe has to be liberal and offer higher wages. Hence the conditions\r\nof work and the rate of wage are not the same in every part of the\r\nforest. The oldest area of working, which is crossed by the Central\r\nCórdoba, between the provinces of Catamarca and Santiago del Estero,\r\nhas a surplus of good workers. On the other hand, the _obrajeros_ of\r\nthe valley from San Francisco to Jujuy, where the exploitation is more\r\nrecent, have only a moderate amount of labour at their command. The\r\nreturns are not higher there than in the south, though the forests\r\nare incomparably denser and richer. It has been very expensive to\r\nbring about a continuous stream of immigration toward the main region\r\nof forest work, which is now called the Chaco, along the railway that\r\nstarts from Añatuya and goes about 130 miles further north. As the\r\nworker is on piece-work, the price per sleeper when the work was begun\r\non the Chaco had to be double, on the Añatuya line, what was paid in\r\nthe older line from Santiago to Frias, close to the _bañados_.\r\n\r\nThe work is profitable only within a short distance from the railways.\r\nWaggon transport raises the price rapidly. Moreover, the forestry\r\nindustry is just as dependent on the railways for provisions as it is\r\nfor the carriage of its wood. The _obraje_ has no source of food-supply\r\non the spot. The marshy estates which begin to spread in the area of\r\nirrigation-canals at Banda, eastward of Santiago del Estero, supply\r\nonly their customers at Añatuya and the Chaco line. Sometimes the\r\nrailway has to bring water as well as food. Over a great part of the\r\nChaco de Santiago there is no running water, and the underground sheets\r\nare little known, or inaccessible, or salty. The _obraje_ is a land of\r\nthirst. In order to meet the demand for water they dig reservoirs like\r\nthe _represas_ on the ranches, which are filled by the rains. But as\r\nsoon as the dry season sets in they become stagnant green pools, and\r\nthe men have to rely on waggon-cisterns.\r\n\r\nWhile the Chaco de Santiago is now a democracy of small _obrajeros_ and\r\ncontractors, the eastern Chaco, along the Paraná, has quite a different\r\ntype of society. It is entirely in the hands of the big tannic-acid\r\nfactories, where the _quebracho_ trunks are stripped and boiled, and\r\ntheir sap is concentrated in a viscous resin. The lofty chimneys of\r\nthese works rise above the forest at intervals. Here the work assumes\r\na capitalistic and industrial character which it has not in other\r\nplaces. It is controlled by powerful concerns, highly organized, which\r\nconduct it on a pre-arranged plan. It is true that the works do not\r\ndeal with the entire output of _quebracho_,[48] but they almost control\r\nthe market, even as regards the unworked wood which is exported, and\r\nthey reserve a good deal of it for their branches in Europe. In order\r\nto secure the heavy loans which the works represent, the companies\r\nthat have built them have been obliged to take over large forests,\r\nand they have come to own these. The concentration of the area in\r\ntheir hands goes on daily, and the number of companies is reduced by\r\namalgamation or by the purchase of rival concerns and their estates. On\r\nthe territory of the Chaco, where the administration of public lands\r\nwas in the hands of the Federal Government, some precautions were taken\r\nto prevent the monopoly of the country; but the forests of the province\r\nof Santa Fé belong entirely to two firms.\r\n\r\n     [48] It is more and more necessary to deal with the extract of\r\n     the _quebracho_ on the spot the further north one goes toward\r\n     the interior of the continent because the freights to the\r\n     exporting ports rise higher and higher.\r\n\r\nThe eastern Chaco has received from Europe, not only the capital that\r\nwas needed for the construction of works, but also a number of workers,\r\neither for administration or for technical direction. These have proved\r\nmore exacting than the creoles of the Santiago saw-mills. Beside most\r\nof the works there are now comfortable villas and brick towns for the\r\nworkers. The expense was quite prudently incurred, as the industry is\r\nless erratic in this region. A tannic-acid factory cannot be removed\r\nlike a saw-mill. When the timber-supply is exhausted in the district,\r\nthe works gets its material from a distance, as long as the freightage\r\npermits. It depends on the railway, not only for the carriage of its\r\nproducts, as the saw-mills do, but for the supply of raw material.\r\n\r\nThe works are not all equally wealthy. They are scattered over about\r\nten degrees of latitude, north of 30° S. lat., within reach of the\r\nriver, which keeps them in communication with the world, and at the\r\nsame time has enabled them to tackle the full breadth of the forest.\r\nThe _quebracho_ is particularly abundant north of Santa Fé and south\r\nof the Argentine part of the Chaco, where it is the life and soul of\r\nthe forest. The works which have been set up there, in the midst of the\r\ndenser forests, have plenty of capital, and this enables them to nurse\r\ntheir supplies and buy timber at a distance. The forest is still almost\r\nvirginal at their gates, so that they have a long future in front of\r\nthem. On the other hand, the oldest works, on the southern fringe of\r\nthe forest, and that of Corrientes, on the left bank of the Paraná, are\r\nalready paralysed for want of timber.\r\n\r\nThe works are all at a short distance from the river; not only for\r\nconvenience of exporting their products, but because this is the only\r\npart of the Chaco where one can find fresh water. And the tannic-acid\r\nfactory needs a great deal of fresh water. Along the river, in a belt\r\nabout thirty to sixty miles wide, we find a permanent hydrographic\r\nnetwork such as is found nowhere else on the plain. It consists of long\r\nseries of marshes covered with rushes (_cañadas_), and in places they\r\nbecome at their mouths regular streams with well defined beds. The\r\nunderground water also is generally fresh and plentiful, whether it is\r\ndue to the abundant rain or to infiltration from the Paraná, and many\r\nof the works have successfully bored for it. In these parts one suffers\r\nfrom too much water as frequently as from thirst. On these immense and\r\nalmost horizontal surfaces the water spreads from the _cañadas_ over\r\nthe whole forest. The railway, and even the houses, then stand out of\r\na sheet of stagnant water, which takes months to disappear. Trunks\r\nwhich are badly placed, lying in the stations to be removed--sometimes,\r\naccording to the market, lying there for years--are half buried in the\r\nmud. The waggons find it hard to move in the roads. Mules, which pay\r\nvery well in the dry forests of the west, could not make the effort\r\nthat is required here, and they use oxen--the finest beasts for a muddy\r\ncountry. The long-horned, lean creole cattle drag the waggons with\r\ndifficulty, and a _correntino_, with long slender legs, shod with mud,\r\nguides and urges them, looking like a crane with his slow and cautious\r\nsteps. The work of these drivers is much harder than that of the\r\nwood-cutters. They earn nearly twice as much, and it is the difficulty\r\nof getting enough men for this work that keeps down production.\r\n\r\nThe importance and stability of the large works has fixed the labour\r\nmarket on the right bank of the Paraná, and there is no need to go to\r\nCorrientes to look for men. They come of their own accord. A daily\r\nservice of small steamers brings them to all the ports which dispatch\r\n_quebracho_. The left bank, on Argentine territory, has also no hiring\r\ncentre, such as there still are at Asunción and Concepción in Paraguay.\r\n\r\nEven on its own land the works leaves the working of the forest to\r\ncontractors, from whom it buys the timber. But the _obrajeros_, whether\r\nthey work in the company's forests or their own, are very dependent\r\nupon the works. The contracts vary according as they are owners or\r\notherwise; according to whether they undertake to deliver the timber at\r\nthe stations or leave it where it is felled; and according to whether\r\nthey have the requisite oxen and waggons or have to loan these from the\r\ncompany. They draw advances from the company, and, on the other hand,\r\nthey pledge themselves to purchase what they require for their workers\r\nat the company's stores. The profit of these sales increases the\r\nrevenue of the works. The company monopolizes all trade, both import\r\nand export. It exercises an absolute sovereignty over the forest.\r\nIt has merely deigned to grant the railway company space enough to\r\nconstruct its lines and its stations.\r\n\r\nThe last forestry centre in modern Argentina is in the province\r\nof Misiones on the upper Paraná. Posadas is its chief station, and\r\nprotects its southern outlet. Its influence extends beyond the\r\nArgentine frontier, over a small part of Brazil and Paraguay. In\r\nMisiones there are two types of forest, which differ a good deal from\r\neach other, while neither resembles the _quebracho_ forest. One is the\r\nforest of araucarias (_pinos_) which covers the elevated tablelands\r\nat a height above 2,000 feet. The other is the tropical forest, rich\r\nin essences and of perennial vegetation, which fills the bottoms and\r\nslopes of the valleys. The pine, which is also much worked on the\r\nBrazilian tableland, yields an excellent white wood, suitable instead\r\nof the northern pine. It would find a ready market at Buenos Aires,\r\nbut it has never been worked on Argentine territory because of the\r\ngreat distance of the woods from a navigable river. On account of its\r\nposition on the tableland the araucaria has to wait for the railways\r\nof some future date.[49] As to the leafy tropical forest it includes\r\na number of useful varieties (_timbo_, _lapacho_, _etc._), but the\r\nmost esteemed of all is the cedar. Its wood is rose-coloured, scented,\r\nand fine-grained, and very suitable for furniture. At the time of\r\nD'Orbigny's travels the inhabitants of Corrientes were looking out for\r\ncedars from the mountains brought down the river when in flood. The\r\n_obrajes_ of cedar-wood now extend twenty miles or so on the Argentine\r\nbank, and forty miles in the Paraguay bank, which is more even and\r\nbetter for transport. The trunks are floated in rafts down to Posadas;\r\nas the cedar, which is less dense than the _quebracho_, not only\r\nfloats, but is improved by parting with sap in the water. At Posadas\r\nthe rafts are taken to pieces, and the trunks are delivered to the\r\nsaw-mills.\r\n\r\n     [49] In Brazil the saw-mills for the araucarian pines are\r\n     established along the São Paolo-Rio Grande Railway.\r\n\r\nBut timber is not the chief forest industry in Misiones, as it is on\r\nthe Chaco. Beside the _obraje_ in the forest there is the _yerbal_,\r\na works for dealing with the _maté_ (_Ilex paraguayensis_). It\r\nis well known that an infusion of _maté_ (a kind of tea) is an\r\nimportant element in the food of the western States of South America.\r\nGathering the leaves of the _maté_ has been a profitable occupation\r\nfor centuries: a unique instance, perhaps, in the forest industries\r\nof South America. It has never been interrupted, though it has often\r\nchanged its locality.\r\n\r\nThe plantations made by the Jesuits were abandoned when the\r\nmissionaries were dispersed. After the close of the eighteenth century\r\nParaguay became the chief area of production. Villa Rica seems to have\r\nbeen the most prolific centre of the _yerba_. After that date, however,\r\nthe Jujuy basin, further north, was exploited, and the _yerbateros_,\r\nwho came from Curuguati, advanced eastward as far as the Falls of\r\nthe Guayra on the Paraná. In the nineteenth century the trade in\r\nParaguay _maté_ seems to have suffered less than the tobacco trade\r\nfrom the policy of isolation adopted by the Dictators of Paraguay. The\r\ndescriptions given by Mariano Molas, Demersay, and others, show that\r\nthe business continued fairly actively. It even extended northward,\r\nand reached as far as the Rio Apa. Villa Concepción became a rival\r\n_yerba_ market to Villa Rica. The monopoly exercised by the Paraguay\r\nGovernment, however, and the restrictions put upon the navigation\r\nof the river, led to the development of the _yerba_ industry in the\r\neastern Misiones on the left bank of the Uruguay. Itaquy served as\r\nport of embarkation. In the last third of the nineteenth century the\r\nyards moved from the left to the right bank of the Uruguay. Since\r\n1870 the Paraná has supplanted the Uruguay, and the _yerba_ trade has\r\nconcentrated at Candelaria. This meant the resurrection of Misiones.\r\nIn 1880 San Javier, on the Uruguay, worked up 800 tons of _yerba_,\r\nand Candelaria more than 1,000 tons. The _yerbales_ round San Javier\r\nbegan to run out, and the _yerbateros_ had to go further and further\r\nup the Uruguay, toward the _yerbales_ of the tableland of Fracan and\r\nSan Pedro. Candelaria was mainly fed by the _yerbales_ of the right\r\nbank of the Paraná, on Paraguayan territory. Posadas has now succeeded\r\nCandelaria, and the _yerbales_ that depend upon it are scattered over\r\nboth banks up the Paraná.\r\n\r\nThe _yerbales_ of Misiones lie outside the tropical forest proper.\r\nThey are on the lower fringe of the pine-forest, and begin at some\r\ndistance from the river, with which they are connected by muddy and\r\ndifficult mule-tracks. _Maté_ can bear a cost of transport that would\r\nbe fatal to timber. At the point where these tracks reach the river,\r\nthe river-steamers stop at the foot of a shed that is almost hidden in\r\nthe foliage. These are the \"ladders\" of the _yerbales_.\r\n\r\nWork in the _yerbales_ lasts six months out of the twelve. The pruners\r\nwho collect the bunches of leaves and bring them to the furnaces, where\r\nthey are dried, include Brazilians, Paraguayans and Argentinians. The\r\nBrazilians go to the _yerbal_ to offer their services. The Paraguayans\r\nand Argentinians, nearly all from the province of Corrientes, are\r\nrecruited at Posadas and the sister-town of Encarnación, which is\r\nopposite to it on the Paraguay bank.\r\n\r\nThe hiring at Posadas is done according to a traditional custom that\r\ndoes not seem to have changed for more than a century. The description\r\ngiven by D'Azara is not yet out of date. \"The people of Villa Rica,\"\r\nhe says, \"depend mainly on being hired for the _yerbales_. The _yerba_\r\nindustry is sometimes profitable to the masters, but never to the\r\nnatives, who work cruelly without any profit. Not only are they paid\r\nin goods for the _yerba_ they gather, but the goods are put at so high\r\na price that it is terrible. They have even to pay for the hire of a\r\nbill for cutting the _maté_.... The natives contract as much debt as\r\nthey can before they start for the _yerbales_, and as soon as they have\r\ndone a little work, they say good-bye to the _yerbatero_, who loses\r\nhis money. And the _yerbatero_ in turn is exploited by the merchants\r\nwho control him.\" Before he starts for the _yerbal_, says Robertson,\r\nthe contractor (_habilitado_) gets an advance of four or five thousand\r\npiastres. With this he hires about fifty workers, supplies their needs,\r\nand gives them two or three months' pay in advance. The three essential\r\nand inseparable elements of the _maté_ business are the _yerbal_ in the\r\nforest, a shop at Posadas for hiring and paying wages in advance, and a\r\n_yerba_ mill at Rosario or Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe forestry industry in its various forms is not a definite occupation\r\nof the soil by man. After having stripped the forest, it leaves,\r\nand the land is open for colonization. Nearly everywhere there is a\r\ncomplete separation between forestry and permanent colonization. They\r\ndo not employ the same workers; the wood-cutter (_hachador_) and the\r\ncharcoal-burner are not the men who clear the soil. The clearing away\r\nof the stumps, which must precede agricultural work, is not their\r\nbusiness, but the work of diggers. At Tucumán, where most of the\r\nworkers in the cane-fields are Santiagueños, Italians and Spaniards are\r\nused for clearing the soil. The gangs of Mendocinos who go to cut crops\r\nin the bush round Villa Mercedes will not sign on for clearing the\r\nground in order to plant lucerne.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LORETO. THE RIO PINTO IN THE DRY SEASON.\r\n  _One of the arms through which the flood of the Dulce flows._\r\n                                             Photograph by the Author.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LA BANDA (SANTIAGO DEL ESTERO).\r\n  _Irrigated lucerne fields on the left bank of the Rio Dulce.

To face p. 112.]\r\n\r\nThe history of forestry and colonization is one of the most diversified\r\nchapters in the general economic history of modern Argentina. Round the\r\nregion of the Pampas, the first point where agricultural colonization\r\ncame into touch with the forest belt is the district of the older\r\ncolonies of Santa Fé. There it found the forestry industry already\r\nlong established, on the banks both of the Salado and of the Paraná.\r\nThe export of timber and charcoal to Buenos Aires and the lime-kilns\r\nof Entre Rios was at this time one of the few elements of economic\r\nlife which Santa Fé had preserved. The colonists did not enter the\r\nforest, and did not mingle with the charcoal-burners, but they\r\nprofited indirectly from their presence by selling them maize. Later,\r\nagricultural work spread over the Central Pampa and the province of\r\nCórdoba, as far as the edge of the scrub in all parts of the prairie.\r\nWood-cutting is carried on there, on a small scale, everywhere, at Toay\r\nas well as at Villa Mercedes and Villa Maria. The price of the wood he\r\nsells is a small supplementary income to the farmer, and clearing the\r\nsoil helps to fill up his time during the dead season for agriculture.\r\nThe lands covered with brushwood remained for a long time at a lower\r\nprice than cleared land. They thus formed a sort of reserve which\r\npartly escaped the speculations in land, and on which small owners\r\ncan find a footing more easily than on the Pampa. There is to-day a\r\nmovement of Santa Fecinos eastward and southward in the belt of scrub\r\nto the south of Mar Chiquita along the line from Lehmann to Dean Funes.\r\n\r\nThe forest area of the Chaco, in northern Argentina, between the Andes\r\nand the Paraná, seems on the other hand to be intended for pastoral\r\ncolonization. In point of fact, the forest of the Chaco, as well as the\r\nlighter scrub which is its southern extension, can be used for breeding\r\nwithout preliminary labour. The Indians have fed cattle and horses on\r\nit since the seventeenth century. The herds find food on every side,\r\nboth in the very numerous clearings (_abras_) which cross the forest\r\nand in the forest itself, where the underwood and the herbaceous\r\ncarpet grow fairly thick beneath the scanty foliage of the mimosas and\r\nquebrachos.\r\n\r\nOver a good deal of the western Chaco pastoral colonization is earlier\r\nthan the forestry. In the district of Santiago del Estero the farmers\r\nhad advanced far beyond the wood-cutter and the railway; beyond the\r\nSalado, almost as far as the existing line from Añatuya to Tintina,\r\nwhere there are sheets and wells of fresh water. The old ranches go\r\nas far as Alhuampa. The old pastoral population has taken very little\r\npart in the forestry industry. It has been content to profit by it by\r\nrenting the scrub to the _obrajes_. It was a sheer gift to them, as\r\nthe felling of a few trees does not in the least lower the value of the\r\npasture. The forestry has not entailed any change in the ownership of\r\nthe land or in the breeding methods. The _obrajes_ are merely passing\r\nguests whose traces are quickly obliterated.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern Chaco, however, the wood-cutters are real pioneers. It\r\nis they who have made the conquest of the forest, often in direct touch\r\nwith the Indians, and the ownership of the land fell to them. They\r\nhave themselves played an essential part in the actual development of\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nLeaving the river and travelling toward the forest on the west, one\r\nfirst crosses a narrow belt of estates which form an almost unbroken\r\nline from San Javier to Resistencia. These are old colonies, mostly\r\nfounded about 1870, at the same time as the first colonies in the\r\ncentre of Santa Fé. They had the advantage of being within reach of the\r\nriver-route, the network of railways that serves the colonies of Santa\r\nFé not being constructed until after 1880. They have not shown the same\r\ncapacity for extension as the colonies on the prairie, but they are\r\nfirmly rooted, on high and well-drained land, very different from the\r\nclays of the Chaco, where the alluvial beds of the Paraná alternate\r\nwith stuff that seems to come from the left bank. They grow flax,\r\nearth-nuts, sugar cane, and cotton. Behind this slight agricultural\r\nfaçade are the large estates of the factories. In the division of the\r\nland the industrial firms sought the districts which were richest\r\nin _quebracho_. Buyers of land who had no industrial plans--foreign\r\ncapitalists and Porteños--and who obtained large concessions in\r\nlittle-known regions, sold back to the factories the plots where there\r\nwas plenty of wood, after they had taken stock of their property. They\r\nconverted the remainder into _estancias_ (ranches). The district to\r\nthe north of the Central Norte Railway, from San Cristobal to Tostado,\r\nwhere the forest, which will presently yield to the plain, breaks\r\ninto patches and looks like a park, includes a number of these modern\r\n_estancias_, in which lucerne is beginning to replace the grasses of\r\nthe natural vegetation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: QUEBRACHO TRUNKS LYING AT THE STATIONS.\r\n  _Eastern Chaco, on the Resistencia line (Santa Fé province). Here the\r\n  quebracho is exploited for tannic acid, not sleepers_.\r\n                                             Photographs by the Author.\r\n  PLATE XI.                                            To face p. 116.]\r\n\r\nWhen one passes to the interior, the pastoral industry at once assumes\r\na more primitive character. The _quebracho_ concerns themselves go in\r\nfor breeding, in order to make use of their large estates, when the\r\ntimber has been removed but the works have not yet been set up. They\r\nneed a large number of cattle, both for moving the timber and feeding\r\ntheir workers, and they endeavour to meet their needs themselves. In\r\nthis district the forest is capable of feeding a far heavier herd than\r\nis the more arid scrub of the eastern Chaco. There are often a thousand\r\nhead of cattle to 2,500 hectares. To the north and west of that part\r\nof the forest where the big companies have taken over the whole of the\r\nland, in the province of Chaco, a fairly large number of estates has\r\nbeen created. Further still, on either side of the Bermejo, cattle\r\nfrom Corrientes and the Paraguay have been put on the public lands\r\nby men with no rights. As their future is uncertain, they cannot do\r\nany expensive work, such as making wells, reservoirs, and enclosures.\r\nSometimes they are compelled by drought to fall back upon the river.\r\n\r\nConditions are quite different in the forests of Misiones. The damp\r\nforest of Misiones does not lend itself to breeding. While the\r\nforest-workers on the west of the Paraná eat fresh meat, thanks to the\r\nproximity of the breeders, in the _yerbales_ and _obrajes_ of Misiones,\r\nthe use of dried or \"jerked\" meat (_carne seca_), which is brought\r\nsome distance, has remained the common practice, as it is in most\r\nparts of tropical America. On the other hand, there is now developing\r\nin Misiones an agricultural colonization of an original kind, quite\r\ndistinct from the ordinary Argentinian type. This is because Misiones\r\nis a province apart in Argentina. It really belongs, by its geological\r\nstructure and its climate, to the Brazilian tableland. The colonies\r\nin Misiones are merely an extension into Argentine territory of the\r\ngreat belt of colonies of southern Brazil, which stretches from the\r\nneighbourhood of Santa Catalina and the Rio Grande do Sul to the River\r\nParaguay. The Brazilian type of colonization is based upon work with\r\nthe hoe, in clearings that have been made in the forest by the axe and\r\nby fire. Ordinary farming would be impracticable between the large\r\nstumps which the clearers have to leave in the ground, to rot there\r\nslowly. It would, moreover, be useless, as the land, though rich in\r\nhumus, is light and aërated. The red soil, a decomposition-product\r\nof the diabases which are at the root of all agricultural wealth\r\nin southern Brazil, covers a great part of Misiones. The economic\r\ninferiority of this agricultural colonization in the forest to the\r\nPampean type which has conquered the grassy plains of the Rio de la\r\nPlata, is twofold. On the one hand, the surface that a man can develop\r\nis very small. The plots of the Brazilian colonies are ten times\r\nsmaller than the average estate on the Pampa. On the other hand, it is\r\ndifficult to get about in the forest, and this hinders the export of\r\nthe produce.\r\n\r\nThe colonies in Misiones are still confined to the edge of the\r\ngreat forest, into which they will advance as the agricultural\r\npopulation grows. They form two groups: one on the river above Posadas\r\n(Candelaria, Bonpland, Corpus, San Ignacio, and Santa Ana), the other\r\non the slopes of the hills, above the line from Posadas to Uruguay (San\r\nJosé and Apostoles). Foodstuffs, tobacco, fowl and eggs, which they\r\nnow send by rail as far as Buenos Aires, are their chief resources.\r\nAs it is possible for them to reach the big markets of the Pampas,\r\nby river or rail, they have a certain advantage over the Brazilian\r\ncolonies. On the other hand, the various elements of their population\r\nare inferior. They are very mixed, comprising aboriginals--relics of\r\nthe ancient Indian or half-breed population of Misiones who have got\r\nland but are in no hurry to cultivate it--Poles (grouped in a few\r\nvillages, such as Apostoles and San José), and German-Brazilians from\r\nthe left bank of the Uruguay. At the present time there is a constant\r\nstream of German-Brazilians through the province of Misiones, to embark\r\nat Posadas, sail up the Paraná, and settle, further north, in Matto\r\nGrosso. No doubt it would be possible to induce part of them to settle\r\non Argentinian territory by offering them suitable land.\r\n\r\nThese peasant clearers of the land rarely find means to sell their\r\ntimber. The tropical forest has an immense variety of species, but only\r\na few of these are of value. The _obrajero_ does not cut down the whole\r\nforest; he chooses his victims. In the waste land of the colonist it is\r\nby no means possible to utilize everything. Even in the area where the\r\nforestry industry flourishes, trunks with no faults, felled in order to\r\nmake room for farming, are pitilessly burned and destroyed.\r\n\r\nYet the indirect advantages of the forestry to agriculture are\r\nnumerous. Just as in the whole of southern Brazil, it affords a good\r\nmarket for agricultural produce. The crops from the colonies are stored\r\nin the shops at Posadas, and from there they go to the _obrajes_ and\r\n_yerbales_. In addition, the industry finds work for more men. On\r\nthe Rio Grande do Sul, and later on the Paraná, the wages paid for\r\ncollecting _maté_ have long been the surest resource of the colonies,\r\nand it is this that enabled them to subsist during the difficulties\r\nof their early period. In Misiones the attraction of the _yerbales_\r\nis not so strongly felt by the inhabitants. There are comparatively\r\nfew colonists who are willing to leave their plots and hire themselves\r\nfor distant work. The _yerbales_ find their recruits, not amongst\r\nthe immigrants from Europe, but amongst the ancient _pobladores_;\r\nthat is to say, men who hold land without a title, whose position was\r\nrecognized when the colony was formed--a floating population, not\r\ndeeply rooted in the soil.\r\n\r\nAgricultural colonization in turn will react upon the forestry industry\r\nin developing the cultivation of _maté_. Large plantations of _ilex_\r\nhave already been established above Posadas. Already they enter\r\nthe common life. They are scattered either over the estates of the\r\nnational colonies or over the larger estates of the richer colonists;\r\nfor planting demands a considerable expenditure. Some of them belong\r\nto dealers who also work natural _yerbales_ elsewhere. They are, if\r\npossible, set up in the forest, or at least on the fringe of it,\r\nin order to have a good supply of wood to dry the leaves. Thus the\r\nprimitive industry of collecting _maté_ is undergoing transformation\r\nwhile the natural growths are disappearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPATAGONIA AND SHEEP-REARING\r\n\r\n     The arid tableland and the region of glacial lakes--The\r\n     first settlements on the Patagonian coast and the indigenous\r\n     population--Extensive breeding--The use of pasture on the\r\n     lands of the Rio Negro--Transhumation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe northern limit of the Patagonian region passes to the north of the\r\nColorado, in the latitude of the Cerro Payen and of the ridge which\r\nleads from Malarüe to the Rio Grande in the sub-Andean zone (36° S.\r\nlat)., and to the Sierra de Lihuel Calel in the southern part of the\r\nPampa province. South of this line, from the Andes to the Atlantic,\r\non the territory of the Neuquen, the Rio Negro, the Chubut, and the\r\nSanta Cruz, is the region of the sheep farms, their refuge since more\r\nprofitable branches of farming have driven the sheep from the Pampa.\r\nThe extensive breeding practised on these poor lands is not profitable\r\nenough to justify much expenditure, and is therefore all the more\r\ncontrolled by the physical conditions. It is true that cattle-breeding\r\nwas once undertaken in the Spanish settlements of the lower Negro, and\r\nstill exists in western Patagonia at the foot of the Andes, but one\r\nnever finds there the particular combination of cattle-breeding and\r\nsheep-breeding which is characteristic of the Pampean region, in which\r\nthe main function of the cattle is to improve the pasture and make it\r\nready for sheep.\r\n\r\nThe climate is trying. The west winds are violent during the greater\r\npart of the year, especially on the coast, and merely relax a little\r\nin the winter. The mean temperature on the Atlantic coast falls nearly\r\none degree for each degree of latitude (14.6° at San Antonio, below 41°\r\nS. lat.; 8.5° at Santa Cruz, below 50° S. lat.; and 5.3° at Ushuaia,\r\nbelow 55° S. lat.). The summer temperature falls even more steeply,\r\nbut the difference is less notable in winter (21.4° at San Antonio,\r\n14° at Santa Cruz, and 9.2° at Ushuaia). The low summer temperature\r\ndoes not allow cereals to ripen south of the Chubut. In the sub-Andean\r\nvalleys the summer is comparatively warm (16° in January at Diez y\r\nseis de Octubre at a height of 1,800 feet), but there is severe frost,\r\nespecially at the beginning of the winter, and no month of the year is\r\nquite free from it.\r\n\r\nRain is plentiful in the Cordillera, and on its western border: 800\r\nmillimetres at Junin, nearly two metres at San Martin (which the wet\r\nwesterly winds reach by the gap of Lake Lacar), and nearly a metre at\r\nBariloche, on Lake Nahuel Huapi. It diminishes rapidly, however, as\r\nsoon as one leaves the mountainous region and goes further east over\r\nthe tableland. The whole tableland has a rainfall of less than 200\r\nmillimetres (Las Lajas 180, Limay 150, San Antonio 180, Santa Cruz\r\n135). It is only south of the Rio de Santa Cruz that the rainfall rises\r\nonce more (Gallegos 400 millimetres, Ushuaia 500 millimetres). Hence\r\nPatagonia as a whole is, with the exception of a narrow belt at the\r\nfoot of the Andes, a semi-arid region with a sub-desert climate. In the\r\nPatagonian Andes the rain falls, as on the coast of Chile, mainly in\r\nwinter. Between Mendoza, which has the summer-rain feature of central\r\nand tropical Argentina, and Chosmalal, in the Neuquen Andes, the\r\ncontrast is absolute. The summer months there (January and February)\r\nare dry, and the rain is confined to the winter months, from May to\r\nAugust. It is the same further south, at Bariloche and at Diez y seis\r\nde Octubre. On the Atlantic coast the winter-rain feature is less\r\nregular and uniform. At San Antonio the heaviest rains fall in autumn\r\n(April and May). There is a secondary maximum in August, and a few more\r\nshowers in the spring (September and October). South of San Antonio the\r\nwinter maximum, which is always marked, is cut by a short dry period\r\n(July and August at Camerones, June at Deseado and Santa Cruz).[50]\r\nIn the interior, on the other hand, the winter-rain system remains\r\nunchanged. The predominance of the precipitations of the cold season is\r\nof great importance to the breeders. As a rule, they come down in the\r\nform of snow, which melts slowly, and the small quantity of moisture is\r\nat least all absorbed in the soil. South of the Santa Cruz the humidity\r\nincreases, but the rainy season alters. At Gallegos the wettest month\r\nis December; at Ushuaia, the rains last from September to March. The\r\nsnow-season (May-August) is the dry season, and the snowfalls are not\r\nheavy enough to interfere with breeding.\r\n\r\n     [50] This anomaly is doubtless due to the proximity of the sea\r\n     and the respite of the westerly winds in winter. The coast,\r\n     with its cold waters and the land-winds causing the deeper\r\n     water to rise, has a special climate of fogs and mists. These,\r\n     which remind us of the _garuas_ of the coast of Peru, do not\r\n     penetrate into the interior.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the Patagonian tableland is very uneven, though it bears\r\ntraces of having been much worn by the agencies of its desert climate,\r\nwhich seems to have lasted through the whole Tertiary Era. Going up\r\nthe Rio Negro, one sees the grey sandstones and Tertiary tufas which\r\nform the cliffs, on both sides of the lower valley. They give place\r\nhigher up to the variegated marls and red sandstones of the Cretaceous\r\nwhich form the tableland at the foot of the first Andean chains. The\r\ncore of ancient granites and porphyries crops up at places from under\r\nthe mantle of Cretaceous and Tertiary sandstones. The horizon of the\r\npeneplain passes from the Tertiary and Cretaceous tableland to level\r\nmasses of crystalline rock, the contour of which has been almost\r\nentirely effaced. Volcanic eruptions have occurred until quite recent\r\ntimes, and so eruptive areas are the salient features of the tableland,\r\nat Añecon and at Somuncurra, south of the district of the Rio Negro,\r\nin the ridge on the left bank of the middle Senguerr, in the Chubut\r\nprovince. The basalts have spread out in sheets, the surface of which\r\nseems to have cooled not long ago. Basalt flows are found as far as\r\nnorthern Patagonia, south of Valcheta and Maquinchao; but their chief\r\nseat is in eastern Patagonia. They cover the inhospitable tablelands to\r\nthe east of Lakes Buenos Aires and Pueyrredon. The Rio Chico and the\r\nSanta Cruz cross them for the upper two-thirds of their course, South\r\nof Coile and Gallegos they spread almost to the coast, and the Tertiary\r\nPampas in this part are dominated by an archipelago of small volcanic\r\ncones.\r\n\r\nThe tableland is crossed from west to east by deep and broad valleys,\r\nenclosed between high cliffs, often strangled by ridges of basaltic or\r\ncrystalline rock, and very little ramified. The ravines (_cañadones_),\r\nwhich make breaches in their cliffs on both sides, go only a little way\r\ninto the sandstone Pampa or the lava tableland. Only a certain number\r\nof these valleys are occupied by important rivers (the Rio Negro and\r\nthe Santa Cruz, for instance) which are born in the Andes, but receive\r\nlittle addition from the light rains of eastern Patagonia. Most of\r\nthe valleys have only intermittent streams (Sheuen, Coile) or are\r\naltogether dry and sown with salt lakes (Deseado). The west wind is now\r\nthe ruler of this network of fossil valleys. It carves their slopes,\r\nand brings into them sand, with which it makes dunes.\r\n\r\nWe must not confuse with these dead valleys the long depressions, with\r\nno outlet, which are scattered over the granite and sandstone tableland\r\n(_bajos_, _valles_, _cuencas_). Some have obstinately, but wrongly,\r\nsought in these the traces of rivers that have disappeared; and the\r\n_bajos_ of Gualicho and Valcheta have wrongly been regarded as the\r\nformer bed of the Rio Negro and the Limay. Erosion by wind seems to\r\nhave had something to do with these depressions. Their persistence, at\r\nall events, is one of the effects of the aridity which prevents normal\r\nerosion from moulding the surface of the tableland. The chief of them\r\nare centres for collecting running water. There is a group of valleys\r\nall round them, and alluvial beds accumulate in them.\r\n\r\nThe climate determines the character of the soil in Patagonia. The\r\nrounded pebbles of granite and eruptive rock, so often described since\r\nthe time of Darwin, sometimes free and sometimes embedded in red sand\r\nor limestone,[51] are spread over the tableland like aureoles round\r\nthe masses of rock, and they are particularly abundant in the coast\r\nregion. On the Rio Negro they seem to be confined to the vicinity of\r\nthe valley; they disappear as one goes away from it. The progressive\r\nreduction in the volume of the Rio Negro gravels, as one goes downward,\r\nhas been observed to begin in the Andean zone, and it is from the\r\nAndes that they come. South of Santa Cruz, in a moister climate, in\r\nwhich the circulation of the water is less localized, the bed is more\r\ncontinuous, and it covers the Tertiary sandstones and clays. It is\r\nof fluvio-glacial origin, and comes from the destruction of the old\r\nmoraines, before the excavation of the actual valleys. But it is the\r\nwind that explains the concentration of the gravel at the surface.\r\nIt separates the pebbles from the more mobile material about them.\r\nWherever the outcrop-strata contain pebbles, the wind eventually\r\nconverts the place into a field of shingle. It has done this with the\r\nterraces of the Limay. The Tertiary marine deposits of the coast region\r\nalso are rich in pebbles torn from the rocky promontories of the shore;\r\nhence the extent of stony soils in the coast region. The wind similarly\r\nstrips naked the angular stones, of local origin and incompletely worn,\r\nround the isolated rocks of the desert tableland or on the flanks of\r\nthe secondary ravines.\r\n\r\n     [51] The calcareous flag-stone of La Tosca, which is\r\n     characteristic of the south-west province of the plain of\r\n     the Pampa, stretches in the south as far as the Rio Negro in\r\n     the coast-district. On the other hand, it is almost entirely\r\n     absent a hundred miles to the west, between the Colorado and\r\n     the Rio Negro, along the line of the railway from Fortin Uno\r\n     to Choele Choel.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the bedding action of the wind creates deposits\r\nconsisting of small and uniform elements from the sands of the dunes to\r\nthe finest dust. The lightest particles, caught up repeatedly by the\r\nsqualls and carried to a great height in the atmosphere, go beyond the\r\nPatagonian region and reach the bottom of the Atlantic or the plain of\r\nthe Pampa. Some of this, however, is deposited in the depressions of\r\nthe tableland, where the moisture fixes it and prevents the wind from\r\nregaining it. These æolian deposits in the depressions, a dark-grey\r\nclay, which hardens when it is dry, but is softened by water, form two\r\nentirely different kinds of soil. If the depression is closed in, or if\r\nthe circulation of the water is too slight, there is a concentration of\r\nthe mineral salts; this is the _salitral_, either naked or sustaining\r\na halophytic vegetation, which the saline efflorescences cover with a\r\nwhite coat during the dry season. If on the other hand, the underground\r\nwaters have a free course, the æolian clay forms the _mallin_. Bushes\r\nand fine grasses grow on it, and, as they decay, gradually give it a\r\ndarker shade and modify its composition. The soil above the _mallin_\r\nis rich in organic elements. It covers the bottom of the valleys\r\nbetween low terraces, covered with faceted pebbles, and dominated by\r\nthe vertical cliffs of tufa and lava. The contrast between the verdure\r\nof the _mallin_ and the arid, dusty, yellow steppe of the tableland\r\nis one of the most characteristic features of Patagonian scenery. The\r\narea in which _mallin_ has been formed coincides with the most humid\r\ndistricts in the vicinity of the Andes and round the higher hills. On\r\nthe road that runs along the right bank of the Limay, at some distance\r\nfrom the river, on the surface of the tableland, the limit between the\r\ncountry of the _salitrales_ and that of the _mallinas_ passes between\r\nTricaco and Chasico, a hundred miles south-east of Neuquen; it almost\r\ntallies with the curve of a 200 millimetres rainfall.[52] Though the\r\nword _mallin_ is not used at Santa Cruz, similar æolian soils are found\r\nin the western part of the tableland up to this latitude. Further south\r\nglacial deposits, clays with moraine-blocks, fill the valleys, and from\r\nGallegos onward, cover the greater part of the tableland.\r\n\r\n     [52] G. Rovereto, \"Studi di geomorfologia argentina: la valle\r\n     del Rio Negro,\" _Bull. Soc. Geol. Ital._, xxxi. 1912, pp.\r\n     101-142 and 181-237.\r\n\r\nOn the eruptive flows of recent date the rock is naked. The wind\r\ncarries away the products of its decomposition, and the dust\r\naccumulates only in the fissures. Traffic is difficult, sometimes\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nToward the west the tableland is separated from the Cordillera by\r\na longitudinal depression, though the continuity of this has been\r\nexaggerated. This depression, which outlines the contact between\r\nthe folded zone of the Andes and the flat zone of the tableland, is\r\nvery important from the point of view of colonization. Just at the\r\nfrontier of the steppe and the forest, it is the most hospitable part\r\nof Patagonia, the richest in natural resources. Amidst the glacial\r\nlacustrine deposits which are accumulated on it there rise masses of\r\ndifferent kinds of rock which break it up into compartments, granitic\r\nridges of laccolites exposed to view, eruptive structures that have\r\nbeen dismantled. In the south the sub-Andean depression forms a broad\r\npassage between Lake Maravilla and Puntá Arenas, about two hundred\r\nmiles long, enclosed between the basalt cliffs of the tableland on the\r\neast and the mountains of the Brunswick Peninsula and William IV Land.\r\nThe bottom of it is a singular glacial landscape, sown with lagoons,\r\npunctuated by scattered hills, with an impermeable soil of drift and\r\nmud. From Lake Argentina to Lake Buenos Aires the elevated tablelands,\r\nwhich rise to a height of 5,000 feet, back upon the Cordillera, and the\r\nsub-Andean depression is interrupted. Similarly, between Lake Buenos\r\nAires and Lake General Paz the contour of the Patagonian tableland is\r\nnot very marked above the sub-Andean zone. The glacial alluvia at the\r\nfoot of the Cordillera rise to the level of the tableland, which sinks\r\nsteadily eastward toward the Genua and the Senguerr. To the north,\r\nbetween Carrenleufu and Lake Nahuel Huapi, the retreat of the lakes has\r\nleft long narrow beds right in the Cordillera, such as the Valle Nuevo\r\ndel Bolson, the bed of which has been taken over by the Futaleufu west\r\nof the Cerro Situación. Further east the topographical features of the\r\nedge of the tableland (the valleys of the Chubut, Tecka, and Norquineo)\r\nlie from north to south. Hence within a space of little more than a\r\nhundred kilometres the sub-Andean zone has a series of parallel roads,\r\ncommunicating with each other by means of broad, transverse gaps, which\r\nat one time were occupied by the lower lobes of the glaciers. The\r\nsub-Andean depression does not go north of Lake Nahuel Huapi.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morphological features of the Patagonian Andes begin at 36° S.\r\nlat.[53] The edge of the Cordillera, in the Malargüe depression, below\r\n35° S. lat., still presents the typical scenery of the central Andes.\r\nThe dejection-cone of the Atuel resembles that of the Mendoza. The\r\nfringe of torrential deposits, distributed in cones over which the\r\nwaters spread, is due to the rapidity of the disintegration of the\r\nrocks in a desert climate. Keidel has pointed out the part played by\r\nthe summer rains in transporting mobile elements, which the water\r\ndrops as soon as the slope diminishes; the amount of precipitation\r\nbeing too slight to permit the formation and spread over the plain of\r\na regular network of streams. From the Rio Grande onward the dejection\r\ncones disappear. The streams tend to become permanent, and sink into\r\nnarrow valleys. The summer rains cease, and the water produced by the\r\nmelting of the snows has only a feeble capacity for transporting stuff.\r\nThe soil of the Cordillera is protected by a denser vegetation. The\r\nfirst thickets of _molle_ appear in the valleys, the first scattered\r\ncypresses on the slopes, at the Rio Agrio, a tributary of the Neuquen.\r\nThen the forest invades the mountain: at first, from 38° S. lat. to\r\n39° 30' S. lat., a resinous forest of araucarias. At length, at Lake\r\nNahuel Huapi, the forest assumes the general appearance which it has as\r\nfar as the Magellan region. It is chiefly made up of different kinds\r\nof beeches. The _coihue_ (_Notofagus dombeyi_) is the most conspicuous\r\nfor about three quarters of a mile, rising above an impenetrable\r\nundergrowth of bamboo. Higher up the domain of the _lenga_ (_Notofagus\r\npumilio_) extends as far as the fringe of the Alpine forests.\r\nThe forest does not reach the eastern limit of the lakes. In the\r\nsub-Andean depression it is reduced to thickets of _ñirre_ (_Notofagus\r\nantarctica_) and _mayten_ and clumps of _calafate_ (something like\r\nmyrtles).\r\n\r\n     [53] The great mass of the Patagonian Andes differs\r\n     considerably in geological structure from the Argentinian\r\n     Andes. The Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and the lofty chains\r\n     of the pre-Cordillera cease at 36° S. lat. The Mesozoic\r\n     beds--variegated breccie and porphyritic conglomerates,\r\n     sandstones, limestones, and marls--which form the western\r\n     slope of the Andes in central Chile, pass to the eastern slope\r\n     at 35° S. lat., where they develop in regular folds, in the\r\n     direction south-south-east, obliquely to the general line of\r\n     the range. These folds account for the orientation of the\r\n     interior valleys, which is remarkably uniform from the Rio\r\n     Negro to the Collon Cura. They pass in the south-west under\r\n     the sandstones of the tableland. West of this sedimentary\r\n     zone, the zone of the sub-Andean granites and diorites, which\r\n     have not been exposed further north except at the base of the\r\n     western slope, opens out in the Patagonian Andes, of which it\r\n     is the main body between Lake Lacar and the Gulf of Ultima\r\n     Esperanza. In fine, the Patagonian Andes are characterised by\r\n     volcanic formations. They are seen on the eastern slope about\r\n     36° S. lat., in the lava-flows and ashes of Payen and Tromen.\r\n     Further south volcanoes with acid lava and characteristic\r\n     cones are restricted to the central zone (Lanin, etc.) and the\r\n     Chilean flank, but flows of fluid basic lava cover enormous\r\n     stretches at the eastern fringe of the Andes, and they have\r\n     spread over a good deal of the Patagonian tableland outside\r\n     the Andean region.\r\n\r\nIt is on the Alumine, about 39° S. lat., that we find traces of glacial\r\nerosion, as they spread over the landscape. At present there is no ice\r\non the mountain except on the peaks of Lanin and Tronador, but from\r\nthe Rio Puelo onward (42° S. lat.), glaciers clothe all the summits\r\nwhich rise above 6,500 feet. North of the Aisen they form a narrow,\r\nbut almost continuous, line. From the Aisen to the Calen fiord, and\r\nbeyond the gap of the fiord as far as 52° S. lat., the ice spreads in\r\na considerable sheet which in some places attains a breadth of eighty\r\nmiles. The tongues of the glaciers reach the Pacific below 46° S. lat.,\r\nand Lake San Martin on the Argentine slope below 49° S. lat. In Tierra\r\ndel Fuego the snow-line is at 2,300 feet, and the glaciers which the\r\nsnows feed, reach as far as the fiords and Lake Fagnano.\r\n\r\nLake Carri Lauquen, on the Barrancas (36° 20' S. lat.), which was\r\nalmost entirely drained in 1914 through the breaking down of the\r\nnatural dam of soft earth which confined its waters, is not a glacial\r\nlake.[54] The chain of glacial lakes stretches from the Alumine to the\r\nSeno de la Ultima Esperanza, and is continued southward by Skyring\r\nWater, Otway Water, and Useless Bay--genuine lakes in communication\r\nwith the Pacific by means of narrow channels. The lakes sometimes lie\r\nin a narrow and deep glacial valley, the bottom of which they fill;\r\nsometimes they branch out into the neighbouring valleys; at other times\r\nthey advance eastward beyond the zone of the mountains and spread into\r\nround basins surrounded by circles of moraines. The largest of them\r\ninclude groups of ramified fiords, which represent their western half,\r\nwhile the eastern half spreads between lower banks.[55]\r\n\r\n     [54] Pablo Groeber, _Informe sobra las causas que han\r\n     producido las crecientes del Rio Colarado en_ 1914. Dir. Gen.\r\n     de Minas, Geol. e Hidrol., Bol. No. 11, series B, Geologia\r\n     (Buenos Aires, 1916).\r\n\r\n     [55] Most of the lacustrine depressions are continued eastward\r\n     across the Patagonian tableland in the shape of distinct\r\n     valleys. The eastern part of the Straits of Magellan is merely\r\n     a submerged valley on the axis of Otway Water. Useless Bay\r\n     also is continued eastward by the hollow which ends in the\r\n     Bay of San Sebastian. Sometimes the waters of the lakes flow\r\n     eastward, toward the Atlantic, along these valleys. Generally,\r\n     however, the lakes of the western slope are drained on the\r\n     west by means of narrow defiles across the Cordillera, or on\r\n     the north and south by rivers which follow the sub-Andean\r\n     depression and thread them together in the manner of a rosary.\r\n     The valley which joins the lake to the Atlantic is in those\r\n     cases a dead valley, and the inter-oceanic dividing line\r\n     of the waters is marked by the frontal moraine of the old\r\n     glacier, which confines the lake on the east. This arrangement\r\n     is found, with surprising regularity, from the Alumine and\r\n     the Lacar to the Neuquen, and as far as Lake Buenos Aires and\r\n     the Seno de la Ultima Esperanza at Santa Cruz. The capture\r\n     of the waters of the eastern slope by the rivers of the\r\n     Pacific across the Cordillera is fairly ancient, and certainly\r\n     pre-glacial. But during the Glacial Period the glaciers\r\n     obstructed the transverse valleys of the Cordillera, and the\r\n     waters of the eastern slope found their way to the Atlantic\r\n     once more. With the retreat of the glaciers the valleys of the\r\n     Cordillera were successively cleared. The lakes, dammed by the\r\n     glaciers, were suddenly released and their level lowered. The\r\n     valleys of the Patagonian tableland were finally abandoned,\r\n     and the topographical accident of secondary importance, which\r\n     the ancient frontal moraine of the glacier represents, came to\r\n     mark the limit of the domain of the Pacific. The freshness of\r\n     the contours of the dead valleys of Patagonia bears witness\r\n     to the recent date of this conquest, which was too sudden\r\n     or rapid to be called a \"capture\" in the proper sense. It\r\n     has not been accomplished everywhere. From Lake San Martin\r\n     to Lake Buenos Aires all the lakes of the eastern slope are\r\n     drained into the Pacific by rivers which flow into the Culen\r\n     fiord. But further south, Lakes Viedma and Argentino are still\r\n     tributaries of the Atlantic. They correspond to the zone of\r\n     the Patagonian Andes which is still covered by inland ice. To\r\n     the north, in the basin of the Puelo and the Yelcho, where the\r\n     trans-Andean valleys long ago ceased to be obstructed by ice,\r\n     the lakes of the eastern slope which drain toward the Pacific\r\n     are small in size. Their level to-day is much lower than it\r\n     used to be, and a network of streams has developed east of\r\n     them, on the earlier lacustrine region, which is now dry.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: YOKE OF CREOLE OXEN USED FOR THE TRANSPORT OF TIMBER\r\n  ON THE EASTERN CHACO, OR CHACO OF SANTA FÉ.\r\n  _On the Central (or Santiago) Chaco mules are used for transport._\r\n                                             Photograph by the Author.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WORKS AT TARTAGAL (EASTERN CHACO) FOR MAKING TANNIC ACID.\r\n  _These works, built by powerful firms, are permanent centres, drawing\r\n  timber from a great stretch of forest, while the saw-mills of the\r\n  Central Chaco move about freely, to be near the felling sites._\r\n                                              Photograph by the Author.\r\n  PLATE XII.

The parts that are not yet occupied are of slight\r\nextent; they consist only of the most desolate regions in the south\r\nof the Rio Negro district and north of Santa Cruz. The expansion of\r\nwhite colonization began only about 1880. Until then the interior was\r\nabandoned to the indigenous tribes and was almost entirely unknown. The\r\nAtlantic coast alone had been explored. The travels of Villarino along\r\nthe Rio Negro and the Limay as far as Lake Nahuel Huapi had left only\r\na faded memory.[56] North of the Rio Negro, Woodbine Parish (1859),\r\nmaking use of the notes left by Cruz, who had crossed the Andes and the\r\nIndian territory between Antuco and Melincue in 1806, was the first to\r\npublish definite information, to which no addition would be made during\r\nthe next forty years.[57]\r\n\r\n     [56] _Diario de D. Basilio Villarino del reconocimiento que\r\n     hizo del Rio Negro en el año de_ 1782 (Coll. de Angelis, vi).\r\n\r\n     [57] It is Woodbine Parish who corrects Villarino's mistake in\r\n     confusing the Neuquen, at its confluence with the Limay, with\r\n     the Rio Diamante, known in the south of the Mendoza province.\r\n\r\nThe settlements founded on the coast by the Spaniards at the close of\r\nthe eighteenth century (S. José and P. Deseado) were ephemeral. Only\r\none of them maintained an obscure existence, Carmen de Patagones, some\r\nmiles above the mouth of the Rio Negro. One of its chief resources\r\nwas the export of salt. Expeditions for this purpose began on the\r\nPatagonian coast about the middle of the eighteenth century (_Journey\r\nfrom San Martin to Puerto San Julian about_ 1753, Coll. de Angelis,\r\nV). After the revolution, Buenos Aires finally abandoned these costly\r\nexpeditions by land to the salt districts of the Pampa, and was\r\nsupplied with salt by schooners from Carmen. During the war with Brazil\r\nand the blockade of the Rio de la Plata, Carmen, protected by the bar\r\nof the Rio Negro, and the Bay of San Blas were the harbours in which\r\nArgentine, English and French privateers concealed their prizes and did\r\ntheir repairs after the storms of the Gulf of Santa Catarina. D'Orbigny\r\nvisited Carmen during this period of equivocal prosperity. One of the\r\nmost curious effects of the hospitality offered to the privateers\r\nwas the unloading upon the Patagonian coast of blacks, intended for\r\nBrazil, who were taken from the slave-traders. Thus an unforeseen eddy\r\nbrought to the south of the Pampean region part of the current of\r\nthe slave-trade intended for the sugar-cane plantations in tropical\r\nAmerica. A number of the Carmen ranches had coloured workers at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBreeding, in fact, was just beginning to spread in the neighbourhood\r\nof Carmen at the time. The cattle had been brought by land from Buenos\r\nAires, and had multiplied along the coast and the river above Carmen.\r\nSouth of Carmen, at San José, the cattle had run wild after the fort\r\nwas abandoned. The Carmen herds were estimated, before the revolution,\r\nat 40,000 head. They disappeared during the revolutionary period,\r\nbut were reconstituted immediately afterwards, and even during the\r\nwar with Brazil there was an active export of hides and salt beef.\r\nCarmen profited mainly by trade with the Indians. It lived in terror\r\nof them, and had garrisons to give the alarm on the routes by which\r\nthey could approach. But this state of chronic warfare did not prevent\r\ntrade. Near Carmen there was a group of peaceful Indians who served as\r\nintermediaries with the tribes of the interior, who were jealous and\r\nhostile. Guides and interpreters were found in this colony, and through\r\nit came the first news of the interior. The traffic with the Indians\r\ncontinued for a long time to be of great use to the colonists. In 1865\r\nthe Welsh colony established on the Chubut, which had many difficulties\r\nat first, was saved from complete disaster by its trade with the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe indigenous population comprised two groups: the Tehuelches,\r\nor Patagonians proper, men of tall stature, and the Araucans,\r\nthe Ranqueles, the Pehuenches and the Pampas. There was no fixed\r\ngeographical limit between them. The Tehuelches lived in southern\r\nPatagonia; but the Araucans advanced eastward as far as the Pampas\r\nregion and southward beyond the Chubut. The Indian population of the\r\nvalley of the Genua and the Sanguerr, south of the colony of San\r\nMartin, comprised in 1880,[58] and still comprises,[59] a mixture of\r\nAraucans and Tehuelches. The Araucans were acquainted with agriculture,\r\nbut, once they had tamed the horse, they became mainly a pastoral and\r\nhunting people, like the Tehuelches.\r\n\r\n     [58] Carlos M. Moyano, \"Informe sobre un viaje a traves de la\r\n     Patagonia,\" _Bol. Instit. Geog. Argent._, ii. 1881, pp. 1-35.\r\n\r\n     [59] W. Vallentin, _Chubut_ (Berlin, 1906).\r\n\r\nIn so far as they were hunters, the Indians of Patagonia were nomadic.\r\nThe taming of the horse only made it easier for them to shift from\r\nplace to place, and gave them a greater range. Their nomadism has too\r\noften been regarded as an aimless wandering. They had laws, settled by\r\nthe physical conditions; and we can gather a few of these. They kept\r\naway from the coastal districts except in winter; that is the season\r\nwhen the rains provide water-courses there. It has been observed that\r\nnames of Indian origin are lacking on the coast of Patagonia. The\r\nSpanish navigators who landed there during the summer found the country\r\ndeserted and the camps abandoned. On the other hand, the share of the\r\nIndians in giving names is very considerable in the interior, as far\r\nas the foot of the Andes. During the summer the Indians approached the\r\nmountains, where they found good hunting grounds. In particular they\r\nchased the young guanacos in the breeding season, December and January.\r\nPopper has indicated similar migrations amongst the Onas of Patagonia;\r\nthey approach the coast in winter, and leave it in summer, to hunt in\r\nthe interior.[60] The district of Lake Nahuel Huapi and Collon Cura\r\nhad some attraction from afar. The forest of araucarias produced seeds\r\n(_pinones_) which the Indians went to gather; and they also liked the\r\nwild apples which ripened on the former estates of the old Jesuit\r\nmissions. The clusters of bamboo on the Cordillera provided the lances\r\nof the Aucas and Tehuelches.\r\n\r\n     [60] J. Popper, \"Exploracion de la Tierra del Fuego,\" _Bol.\r\n     Instit. Geog. Argent._, viii. 1887, pp. 74-93.\r\n\r\nLake Nahuel Huapi is the first stage of the busiest of the routes used\r\nby the Indians. It came from the lower Santa Cruz, went up the Rio\r\nChico, and from there northward followed the foot of the Cordillera.\r\nD'Orbigny was told about it: \"All the Indians who live near the Andes\r\ngo along the eastern foot of the mountains in their journeys, because\r\nthey find water there, whereas they would find none if they went by the\r\ncoast; in that way they travel from the Straits of Magellan to the Rio\r\nNegro.\" The Indian track only left the sub-Andean depression between\r\nthe Rio Chico and Lake Buenos Aires, in the district where the high\r\nbasalt _mesetias_ extend as far as the Cordillera, and on the Pampa of\r\nthe Sanguerr.\r\n\r\nFrom Lake Nahuel Huapi the Indians of the south descended the Limay\r\nand the Rio Negro, and reached the island of Choele Choel, some 230\r\nmiles above Carmen, where they met the Aucas and Puelches. There they\r\nexchanged their _guanacos_ hides for woollen fabrics made by the Aucas.\r\nChoele Choel was the only large, purely indigenous market; the whites\r\nnever visited it. Geographical reasons fixed the site of this market of\r\nthe nomads. In the latitude of Choele Choel the Rio Negro approaches\r\nthe Colorado and the archipelago of the Sierras of the southern Pampa,\r\nwhich mark so many stages on the routes from the Pampa to the Andes.\r\nTo the south the coast-route, less exposed to snow than the sub-Andean\r\ntrack, began from Choele Choel. The Indians followed this to reach\r\nthe Gulf of San Jorge and the Santa Cruz in winter, during the rainy\r\nseason. Darwin notes the importance of the site and the ford of Choele\r\nChoel. Villarino had suspected it, and had, as early as 1782, pleaded\r\nfor the building of a fort there. By holding this point, he said,\r\nthey could prevent the tribes from attacking Buenos Aires, or from\r\napproaching the Patagonian coast in the district of San José.[61]\r\n\r\n     [61] _Informe de D. Basilio Villarino à Fr. de Viedma_, Coll.\r\n     de Angelis, v.\r\n\r\nAs far back as we can go, the life of the Indians seems to have been\r\ndeeply influenced by their relations with the whites. The Aucas brought\r\nto Choele Choel, not only the products of their industry, but also\r\nobjects stolen or bought from the Christians on the Pampa. The report\r\nof Musters, who followed a Tehuelche tribe from Santa Cruz to the\r\ncountry of the Manzanas (\"land of apples\"), shows clearly that the\r\nattraction of the Nahuel Huapi region for the Indians was less due to\r\nits natural resources than to the presence of the Chilean settlements\r\nat Valdivia, from which came across the passes of the Cordillera\r\ncertain quantities of brandy.\r\n\r\nThe Indian never took to cattle-breeding. His herd never consisted of\r\nmore than mares and a few sheep. But trade in stolen cattle quickly\r\nbecame the chief occupation of the tribes. It would, however, be a\r\nmistake to imagine that the thievish Indian was merely and always a\r\ndreaded enemy of the ranches of Carmen. They sometimes had recourse to\r\nhis services and profited by his misdeeds. After the Revolution, it was\r\nthe Indians who helped to fill once more the ranches of the Rio Negro,\r\nbringing runaway cattle which had remained in the San José district.\r\nLater, Carmen bought the cattle stolen by the Indians at Buenos Aires.\r\nFrom 1823 to 1826 the number of the cattle sold by the Indians to the\r\ncolonists on the Rio Negro is estimated at 40,000. Hence the breeders\r\nof Carmen had, as regards the Indians, alternate periods of armed\r\nconflict and complicity.\r\n\r\nBut Chile was always the great market for stolen cattle. Raids\r\n(_malones_) and the crossing of the Cordillera by convoys began in the\r\neighteenth century, and continued throughout the nineteenth, until\r\n1880, when the consolidation of Argentine authority on the eastern\r\nside gave a more regular form to the cattle-trade. The convoys came to\r\na halt at Antuco and Chillan from which the Chilean buyers sometimes\r\naccompanied the Indian tribes as far as the _tolderias_ on the edge of\r\nthe Pampa. The trade in stolen cattle made use of all the passes of the\r\nCordillera, from the Planchon pass below 35° S. lat., which Roca had\r\ncovered in 1877 by the fortress of Alamito, to the source of the Bio\r\nBio. The one most used was the Pichachen or the Antuco pass. On the\r\ntableland the cattle-tracks formed a regular network with innumerable\r\nstrands, spreading over a width of about two hundred miles. The most\r\nnorthern route started east of the Poitague district and, after fording\r\nthe Salado and the Atuel, and passing the _aguadas_ of Cochico and\r\nRanquilco, entered the Cordillera at the bend of the Rio Grande.\r\nAnother track ascended the Colorado and then reached the high valley of\r\nNeuquen. A third crossed from the Colorado to the Rio Negro, and, above\r\nthe confluence of the Limay, to the Rio Agrio or the Alumine.\r\n\r\nThe first exact information about the range of the Patagonian Indians\r\nis supplied by a group of bold travellers who followed their tracks\r\nfrom 1870 to 1880: Musters, Moreno, Moyano, Ramon Lista, etc. Their\r\ndiscoveries had already outlined the geographical survey of Patagonia\r\nwhen the campaign of 1879-1883 opened it to colonization.\r\n\r\nThe story of white colonization since 1880 shows us several distinct\r\nstreams of population. The first, starting from the region of the\r\nPampa, went from north to south along the Atlantic coast, and gradually\r\nextended its sphere toward the interior. The breeders used the\r\nsea-route, the ancient Indian track with recognized sources of water,\r\nto convey their first herds. In 1884, the only spot inhabited on the\r\ncoast between the Rio Negro and the Deseado was the Welsh colony on the\r\nChubut. In 1886 Fontana reports ranches in the Puntá Delfin district,\r\nsouth of the Chubut.[62] About 1890 the whole district round the Gulf\r\nof San Jorge was occupied; and a little later the stream from the north\r\nmet the stream from the south about San Julian and Santa Cruz. The\r\nexpansion of colonization was less rapid in the interior. Ambrosetti\r\ntells us of the establishment of the first ranches round the Sierra de\r\nLihuel Calel in 1893,[63] and at the same time Siemiradzki still found\r\nfew traces of colonization on the Colorado.[64]\r\n\r\n     [62] L. J. Fontana, \"Exploracion en la Patagonia austral,\"\r\n     _Bol. Instit. Geog. Argent._, vii, 1886, pp. 223-239.\r\n\r\n     [63] J. B. Ambrosetti, \"Viage a la Pampa central,\" _Bol.\r\n     Instit. Geog. Argent._, xiv. 1893, pp. 292-368.\r\n\r\n     [64] J. V. Siemiradzki, _Eine Farschungsreise in Patagonien_,\r\n     Petermann's _Mitteilungen_, xxxix. 1893, pp. 49-62.\r\n\r\nThe second stream of colonization came from the Magellan region. It\r\nstarted in Chilean territory, about Puntá Arenas. It was about 1878\r\nthat sheep-breeding spread round Puntá Arenas, and between 1885 and\r\n1892 was the most rapid growth of the ranches of the Magellan district.\r\nNorth of the Straits they occupied the lowlands round Skyring Water\r\nand Otway Water, then the plateau south of Gallegos. They spread\r\nalong the Atlantic as far as the Santa Cruz. In 1896 the limit of\r\nthe sheep-region was on the Santa Cruz about forty miles from the\r\ncoast.[65] To the west, Puerto Consuelo was founded in 1892, and in\r\n1896 colonization came up against the mountain barrier which the Cerro\r\nPayen and the basalt tableland of the Cerro Vizcachas interpose between\r\nLake Argentine and Ultima Esperanza fiord.\r\n\r\n     [65] J. B. Hatcher, _Reports of the Princeton University\r\n     expeditions to Patagonia_ 1896-9 (_Narrative of the\r\n     Expeditions_ and _Geography of Southern Patagonia_, Princeton,\r\n     1903).\r\n\r\nThe spheres of primitive colonization in southern Patagonia on the\r\ncoast still differ from each other in regard to density of population.\r\nBut breeders in search of unoccupied land have not hesitated to push\r\nbeyond. In 1895 and 1900 they passed west of the Gulf of San Jorge\r\ntoward the basin of the Sanguerr and the Genua, (establishment of the\r\nSarmiento colony, south of Colhuapi, 1897: establishment of San Martin\r\non the Genua 1900). Since 1900 the population has also advanced up the\r\nSanta Cruz and the Rio Chico as far as the zone of the Andes, and the\r\nlagoon which still existed twenty years ago, between the district of\r\nthe Sanguerr and that of Lake Argentino, and is easily recognized on\r\nthe maps of the Frontier Commission, has been almost entirely filled up.\r\n\r\nThe story of colonization in the northern part of the Patagonian\r\nAndes is more complicated. Immediately after the campaign of 1883 the\r\nvalleys of the Neuquen were invaded by Chilean immigrants, half-breeds\r\nof the frontier, who cannot always be easily distinguished from pure\r\nAraucans. A certain number of Chilotes, and even Germans from the\r\nsouthern colonies of Chile, were mixed with the half-breeds. This\r\nstream of immigration had begun before the conquest. As early as 1881\r\nHost notices that there are at Chosmalal various families of Chilean\r\nfarmers who held their lands from the Indian _cacique_. During the\r\nsummer they took care of the migratory herds from the Chilean plain.\r\nOnce the country was pacified, they grew rapidly in number. It was they\r\nwho provided the manual labour for the placer miners of the Neuquen,\r\nwhere gold began to be worked in 1890. The area of Chilean colonization\r\nextends from the Rio Atuel, where Villanueva found Chilean immigrants\r\nin 1884, to the south of Lake Nahuel Huapi, where Chileans were still\r\nmet by Vallentin in 1906, on the Rio Pico, close to 44° S. lat.[66]\r\nSouth of Nahuel Huapi there is no regularly used route across the\r\nCordillera.[67] The Chilean colonists of the southern zone came from\r\nthe north, therefore, along the eastern foot of the Andes. Bailey\r\nWillis calculated that there were 2,000 Chileans in a total population\r\nof 3,500 in the sub-Andean area from Nahuel Huapi to Diez y seis de\r\nOctubre. The total number of Chilean immigrants may be about 20,000. It\r\nis not on the increase, as immigration from Chile was suspended from\r\n1890 to 1895. Since the reconstruction of the frontier the Chilean\r\nGovernment has tried to bring back part of the emigrants to its own\r\nterritory. Many have gone to settle in the valley of the Lonquimay. In\r\n1896 Moreno saw traces everywhere in the valley of the Collon Cura of\r\nthe departure of Chilean colonists who had left the country.\r\n\r\n     [66] C. Villanueva, \"De Mendoza a Narguin,\" _Bol. Instit.\r\n     Geog. Argent._, v. 1884, pp. 171-4.\r\n\r\n     [67] Chilean woodcutters have sometimes got as far as the\r\n     eastern valleys in search of larch, but these were nomads who\r\n     did not settle.\r\n\r\nAt first it was only the Argentinians of the western provinces, San\r\nJuan and Mendoza, who vied with the Chileans for the soil. It is they\r\nwhom Furque found in 1888 at Roca, on the Rio Negro. But beginning\r\nwith 1890-95, immigrants of various nationalities have settled on the\r\nNeuquen and the Negro.[68] Foreign capitalists organized their first\r\nranches there. In 1888, on the other hand, the Welsh of the lower\r\nChubut, led by Indian guides, went from the coast to the sub-Andean\r\nregion, and settled in the valley of Diez y seis de Octubre. Between\r\n1895 and 1900 the neighbouring valleys began to be inhabited, and\r\nthe colonization areas of Nahuel Huapi and the Sanguerr came into\r\ncontact.[69]\r\n\r\n     [68] Furque, \"Descripción del Pueblo General Roca,\" _Bol.\r\n     Instit. Geog. Argent._, ix. 1888, pp. 124-132.\r\n\r\n     [69] In spite of their importance we must regard as mere\r\n     episodes in the story of Patagonian colonization the influx\r\n     of population caused on the eastern coast by the discovery\r\n     of placer-gold at Cape Virgenes and on the Atlantic coast of\r\n     Tierra del Fuego (1884), and the discovery of petroleum at\r\n     Rivadavia (1907) in the course of drilling in search of water.\r\n     Rivadavia is already, with its 3,000 inhabitants, one of the\r\n     chief centres in Patagonia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature of colonization in Patagonia is the very low\r\ndensity of population. The Census of 1914 gives 81,000 inhabitants\r\naltogether for the territories of the Rio Negro, the Neuquen, the\r\nChubut, the Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego. A well-kept ranch of\r\n25,000 square kilometres has only a staff of about a hundred men at\r\nthe most, counting strangers, settled on its land; three hundred\r\ninhabitants, or scarcely more than one to ten square kilometres.\r\nThis population falls into two distinct classes. One is the class of\r\nproprietors with regular titles: a rooted and stable class. At first\r\nthe Government granted enormous concessions, which were taken up\r\nespecially by English buyers, but it now seeks to break up the land,\r\nand the plots which it puts on the market for new pastoral colonies\r\nhave not more than 625 hectares. This is too small for breeding, no\r\nmatter how good the situation may be, and there will inevitably be,\r\none would think, a concentration of estates in the hands of a few\r\nproprietors. The other part of the population occupy lands which they\r\ndo not own. They are displaced steadily as the regular concessions\r\nare sold to new ranches. They live, so to say, on the margin of\r\ncolonization, and are more and more restricted to the poorest lands.\r\nSometimes these _intrusos_ or _pobladores_ get hospitality for their\r\nherds on the land of some ranch in return for their services. They\r\nhave little capital, and never make material improvements. They take\r\nno care to nurse the pasture, and it matters little to them if it is\r\nimpoverished.\r\n\r\nThe climate divides Patagonia into two distinct regions. In the west,\r\nthe moist Andean zone is suitable for cattle-breeding. About 1870 the\r\nChileans of Valdivia hunted wild cattle in the Nahuel Huapi district.\r\nSimilarly the Frontier Commission met large herds of wild cattle on\r\nthe shores of Lake San Martin, which were not yet occupied. Sheep do\r\nnot get on well in the moist zone, where the rains have washed out\r\nthe soil and carried away the salts which seem to be indispensable\r\nto the sheep. It is the arid tableland that is the land of the\r\nsheep. There it has displaced cattle, even in the area which the\r\nearly breeders at the end of the eighteenth century had filled with\r\ncattle. Between the sheep-area and the cattle-area is a mixed region,\r\nwhere the two are combined. It extends more or less according as the\r\ntransition from a moist to a desert climate is gradual or sudden. It\r\nis especially important in the districts where colonization is already\r\nold, as in the Fuegian and Neuquen regions. It is lacking in districts\r\nwhere the colonization is recent (Chubut and Santa Cruz), where the\r\nsheep-breeders have had a free run as far as the Andes. The ranches of\r\nthe Cordillera, which specialize in cattle-breeding, all have small\r\nflocks of sheep for their own use, their staff being so small that it\r\ndoes not pay to kill the cattle.\r\n\r\nThe sheep-area is by far the more extensive of the two. The patches of\r\nagricultural colonization are very scattered and small on its surface.\r\nThey are restricted to the river-oases of the Rio Negro and the Chubut.\r\nThese small tilled districts have preserved a remarkable economic\r\nindependence as regards the pastoral zone, in which they seem lost.\r\nThus the farmers on the Chubut exported their wheat to Buenos Aires\r\nuntil about 1900, and they still send their bales of dry lucerne there.\r\nSome of the ranches have tilled small oases in suitable places, but\r\nthese are merely intended to increase their stores of fodder; not for\r\ntheir flock of sheep, but for the saddle-horses used in watching the\r\nestate and the draught-horses used for transport.\r\n\r\nThe pastoral capacity of the Patagonian scrub is, on the average,\r\nfrom 800 to 1,200 head of sheep to 25 square kilometres: less than a\r\ntenth that of the prairies of the eastern Pampa. The ranch fixes its\r\nresidence in the best part of the estate, where there is least fear of\r\na shortage of water, and where pasture is most plentiful. To this the\r\nsheep are brought periodically to receive disinfecting baths against\r\nthe scab, and for shearing. These incessant movements toward the\r\ncentre of the ranch cause an almost permanent strain on the pasture,\r\nand this is one of the chief anxieties of the breeder. The area of the\r\nestate is divided as soon as possible into sections (_potreros_) by\r\nsteel-wire fences, which enables them to watch over the reproduction\r\nand improvement of the flock and make the best use of the pasture.\r\nFencing is more advanced near the Cordillera, as timber for the posts\r\nis found there.\r\n\r\nCertain districts are still uninhabited on account of the lack of\r\nwater. Some of the sources of water are permanent. The water issues\r\nat the base of the volcanic rocks, when the underlying rock is\r\nimpermeable, and above the various levels of the marl in the Patagonian\r\nswamps; for instance, in the _cañadones_ round the Gulf of San Jorge.\r\nBesides this, the rain and melting snow leave on the surface of the\r\ntableland a great number of pools, which evaporate in the dry season.\r\nThese are temporary supplies, the _manantiales_, to which the breeders\r\nare reduced over large areas of the tableland. Most of the stagnant\r\nsheets of water which are permanent are saline. The proportion of salt\r\nin them is very variable, and changes in each case according to the\r\ncycle of dry and wet years. The water of the Carilaufquen was fresh in\r\n1900, and in 1914 it had become brackish, though it could still be used\r\nfor the flocks.\r\n\r\nFinding permanent sources of water is the first concern of the breeder.\r\nIn some districts he has succeeded in tapping sheets of fresh water\r\nby means of wells. There are none of these wells in the crystalline\r\nzones, the closed hollows, where the sheets of water are often large,\r\nbut they are always saline. Neither are there any in the red sandstone\r\ndistrict, the dryest of all. In the western region the wells are sunk\r\nin the arid valleys, along the track of the underground stream. Thus\r\nthe Picun Leufu, the visible course of which is lost seventeen miles\r\nabove its confluence with the Limay, may be traced by a continuous line\r\nof wells. It is especially in the coastal districts that the wells have\r\ntransformed the conditions of breeding. Water was first discovered at\r\nthe foot of the dunes, along the coast itself (district of Viedma, San\r\nJosé, etc.). Since then deep borings have been made over the whole\r\nof the Tertiary platform on both sides of the lower part of the Rio\r\nNegro, north of San Antonio. There every ranch has its sheet-iron tank,\r\nsheltered by a clump of tamarinds, with a windmill to fill it.\r\n\r\nAll pastures are not equally available in every season. Those which are\r\nat a height of more than 4,000 feet in the north, and 2,300 to 2,600\r\nfeet in the south, are covered in winter with a thick mantle of snow.\r\nThese are summer pastures. During the winter the animals are brought\r\ndown to the principal valleys or to sheltered _cañadones_ below the\r\nlevel of the tableland. The _mallin_ is, as a rule, a winter pasture.\r\nWhen it is too wet, however, it is treacherous, and the animals are\r\nburied in it. They have to wait for fine weather before going into\r\nit. The pastures, too, which have no permanent water supply, or have\r\nonly _manantiales_, which dry up at the beginning of summer, can only\r\nbe used during the winter. Hence each ranch has to have, besides its\r\nassured water supply, a suitable combination of summer and winter\r\npasturage, and it is far from certain that this will be found on every\r\nestate, cut up geometrically for colonization, as they were, by the\r\nadministration of lands.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE VOLCANO PUNTIAGUDO.\r\n  _On the Chilean side, to the north of the road from Lake Nahuel Huapi.\r\n  The glaciers come down lower on the western side, as the moist winds\r\n  come from the west, and the rain becomes less and less frequent as one\r\n  goes eastward toward the Patagonian tableland._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CERCAS ON THE LIMAY (RISING IN LAKE NAHUEL HUAPI), NEAR\r\n  THE CONFLUENCE OF THE TRAFUL.\r\n  _Here the Limay enters the sub-desert tableland.

To face p. 142.]\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the flock and the first occupation of the land have\r\ncompelled breeders to undertake difficult journeys, and more than one\r\nof these proved disastrous. The earliest arrivals, driving their sheep\r\nalong little-known tracks, could not avoid losses in crossing the arid\r\nparts of the tableland: parts which D'Orbigny, translating literally\r\nthe Spanish word _travesia_, calls \"crossings.\"[70] When the ranch is\r\nestablished, the breeding does not necessitate any further movements of\r\nthe flocks to a great distance, apart from certain special migrations,\r\nor \"transhumations,\" which I will consider later. It is on each ranch,\r\nsometimes on each group of ranches combined in a single estate, that\r\nthey pass alternately from winter to summer pasture. The only transport\r\nnecessary is that of wool. The fleeces, which the west wind has heavily\r\nladen with dust, are collected in the sheds belonging to the ranch, or,\r\nin the case of the _intrusos_, on the premises of certain small traders\r\n(_bolicheros_) who are scattered over the tableland even at its extreme\r\nlimits. Convoys of wagons then take them to the ports on the coast.\r\n\r\n     [70] The search for possible routes for cattle in the\r\n     districts that were not yet colonized helped in the study of\r\n     Patagonia. Moyano was doing this when he explored the route\r\n     from Santa Cruz to Lake Nahuel Huapi.\r\n\r\nFor some years now, however, wool has ceased to be the sole product\r\nof the ranches. A little before 1895 the first slaughter-houses, for\r\nkilling the older sheep that were no longer fertile, were erected on\r\nthe Straits of Magellan. Refrigerators have succeeded these, and were\r\nopened at Puerto Callegos and San Julian. A third refrigerator is being\r\nconstructed (1915) at Puerto Deseado. In southern Patagonia, also, part\r\nof the flock is sent to the refrigerators or to the slaughter houses\r\nof the Pampean region. The creation of the refrigerator has compelled\r\nbreeders to adapt their work to the new economic conditions. The merino\r\nbreed is being eliminated by the Lincoln in all districts which feel\r\nthe influence of the refrigerator; the Lincoln is of greater weight and\r\nquicker growth, but the merino survives in arid northern Patagonia.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the establishment of the refrigerators has caused\r\nimportant movements of transport. The flocks which are to go to the\r\nrefrigerators or the northern railways are moved in the good season,\r\nafter the shearing, from November to April. The routes they take are\r\nnot invariable. One of the most frequented, leading from the sub-Andean\r\ntablelands to San Julian, follows the Santa Cruz valley. When the land\r\nwas cut up, there was no reason to foresee these movements, and nothing\r\nwas done to facilitate them. The roads cross the ranches, which are\r\ncompelled to allow it. It is a serious burden for some of them, unless\r\nthey can make a profit out of their situation on the road by hiring\r\npasture for the flocks as they pass.\r\n\r\nThe Andean zone itself is still mainly pastoral, but it is nevertheless\r\nfar more varied and richer in possibilities of development than the\r\ntableland. Agriculture is already combined with breeding in that area.\r\n\r\nThe name _vegas_, which in the Puna and at San Juan means alpine\r\npasture, is applied here to tilled patches in the Andean valleys.\r\nThey are found in the north in the valley of the Neuquen, round\r\nChosmalal. In the south, the valley of the Rio Pico marks the limit of\r\ncultivation. Irrigation is almost always necessary north of Lake Nahuel\r\nHuapi, where the _vegas_ have, as a rule, a soil of coarse alluvia or\r\npermeable tufa, which dries up quickly. Water is plentiful, it is true,\r\nand increases in quantity rapidly as one travels southward. The chief\r\nobstacle to the extension of cultivation is the frequency of frost in\r\nspring and summer. The deep hollows of the sub-Andean depression south\r\nof Lake Nahuel Huapi, the height of which drops to 1,000 feet at the\r\nBolson, and 1,600 feet at Diez y seis de Octubre, have no frosts in\r\nsummer, and they sustain small agricultural communities. At higher\r\nlevels, in the basin of the lake or on the _vegas_ of the Traful and\r\nLake Lacar, at an altitude of about 2,600 feet, the distribution of the\r\nsummer frosts is closely related to the contour and lie of the land,\r\nwhich may facilitate or impede the circulation of the layers of cold\r\nair, and the play of what has been called atmospheric drainage. The\r\nvalleys which are very open from west to east, at the outlet of the\r\nlakes, where the west winds have a free passage, are little liable to\r\nfrost. Wherever frost is frequent, cultivation has to be restricted to\r\nfodder plants. The more favoured cantons, which grow wheat, rye and\r\npotatoes, help to feed the local pastoral population, and export part\r\nof their produce to some distance on the tableland.\r\n\r\nCattle-breeding is, like sheep-breeding on the tableland, practised\r\nboth by the _pobladores_ on public lands and by ranchers who have\r\nsettled on regular concessions, which they have worked up and fenced\r\nround. The high alpine pastures, above the fringe of the forest, are\r\npartly used, from December to March, as summer-pasture. The forest also\r\nserves for pasture; it is a sort of common land, available both in\r\nwinter and summer. Below the height of 3,500 feet the clumps of bamboos\r\nin the underwood provide shelter during the winter and fodder which\r\nis not buried under snow. The fires lit by the breeders have changed\r\npart of the primitive forest into a scrub which has been invaded by a\r\nleguminous climbing fodder, and it has superior pastoral capacity to\r\nthe forest. East of the forest, the prairie, which is too much exposed\r\nto the winds, is not generally suitable for winter-pasture. The cattle\r\ntake refuge in sheltered valleys and in the _mayten_ thickets which\r\nfollow the depressions. Bailey Willis puts the pastoral capacity of the\r\nvirgin forest at 400 cattle to each 2,500 hectares, 600 for the burnt\r\nforest, and 350 for the sub-Andean prairies. The essential problem in\r\nconnection with the question of completely developing the pastoral\r\nresources of the sub-Andean region is the problem of transit. There\r\nare no roads from one district to another and to the higher prairies.\r\nThe fallen trunks which lie about the forest obstruct the way of the\r\ncattle. Collecting the animals for sale and watching them are both\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the profit of exploiting the timber must necessarily be\r\nsmall. The forest, thinned by fire and difficult of access, is partly\r\ncomposed of trees that are too old. The _libocedrus_ has disappeared\r\nfrom one-third of it. The larch, which is the most valuable, passes\r\ninto Argentine territory at few places. Saw-mills are not so numerous\r\non the eastern slope of the Andes as they are in the Magellan area.\r\n\r\nThe essential function of the forest is, according to Argentine experts\r\non forestry, to control the water-circulation. In this land of glacial\r\nerosion and recent captures, where the water-courses have always a\r\ngreat variety of form, and there are lakes to make their output more\r\nregular, it is particularly easy to make use of hydraulic power. \"White\r\ncoal\" will, Bailey Willis says, make a great industrial region of\r\nit, and plant an urban life in it. Bailey Willis, whose optimism and\r\nprophetic gift will not fail to surprise the European reader, has drawn\r\nthe plans in detail of a future town of 40,000 souls at the eastern end\r\nof Lake Nahuel Huapi. The Patagonian land will supply the raw material\r\nof its industries; timber, leather, and wool.\r\n\r\nOne, at least, of the indispensable conditions of the development of\r\nurban life is fully realized in the district of Lake Nahuel Huapi and\r\nthe Limay. It is a remarkable meeting-place of natural roads, and its\r\neconomic value will increase in the future. It is the point where the\r\nroad from eastern Patagonia by the sub-Andean depression, from the Gulf\r\nof San Antonio on the Atlantic, and from the Rio Negro by the Limay,\r\nand the roads that lead to Chile across the Cordillera, meet. The whole\r\nzone of the Andes between 36° S. lat. and 42° S. lat., the latitude of\r\nthe southern part of the Chilean plain, has numerous and easy passes.\r\nThere has always been close communication between the two slopes,\r\nand people have emigrated freely from one to the other. But north of\r\n39° S. lat. the passes are rarely lower than 5,000 feet. They are\r\ncovered with snow in the winter, and can be used for traffic only in\r\ncertain seasons. It is not the same south of the volcano Lanin. That\r\nis the beginning of the glacial valleys which go to the heart of the\r\nCordillera, some of them crossing the mountains from east to west. They\r\nhave not yet been entirely explored. The Bariloche pass, south of the\r\nTronador, by which the Chilean missionaries reached Nahuel Huapi in the\r\neighteenth century, is no longer used. The Cajon Negro pass, west of\r\nLake Traful, through which Bailey Willis traces the line of a southern\r\ntrans-Andean railway, was only recently discovered, and the valleys\r\nwhich run into it on the Chilean side are not yet well known. The two\r\nbest-known trans-Andean routes to-day are the Perez Rosales road, which\r\nleads from Chile to Nahuel Huapi by the north of the Tronador, and\r\nfurther north, the road from Lake Lacar to San Martin. Both these have\r\nreceived some attention, and the lakes are connected by telegraph or\r\ntelephone. The frequent need to unload and reload makes the traffic\r\ncostly, but it is permanent and is not interrupted in winter. The\r\nreduction of the export of cattle to Chile has cut down the traffic for\r\na time, but it is sure to recover. The permanent importance of it is\r\none of the facts most clearly written by nature upon the soil of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not easy, in the absence of documents, to attempt to give for\r\nPatagonia as a whole a detailed description of the pastoral industry,\r\nand to follow step by step on the spot its efforts to adjust itself to\r\nthe natural conditions. But the analysis may be attempted in regard\r\nto the region between San Antonio and Lake Nahuel Huapi south of the\r\nRio Negro,[71] the valley of the Rio Negro, and the tableland which\r\nstretches westward between the Neuquen and the Limay. This part of\r\nPatagonia is now easily accessible, and it is entered by two parallel\r\nrailways. One starts from San Antonio on the Atlantic, and goes\r\nwestward to Lake Nahuel Huapi. It has (1914) reached Maquinchao, on\r\nthe tableland, mid-way across the Andes. The other starts from Bahía\r\nBlanca. At Choele Choel it enters the valley of the Rio Negro, and\r\nascends it as far as the confluence of the Neuquen. Then it goes 130\r\nmiles westward as far as Zapala, at the foot of the first sub-Andean\r\nchains. Each of these lines is ambitious to attract the trans-Andeans.\r\nAt all events, they are in a hurry to reach the humid zone at the foot\r\nof the Andes, which could maintain a busier traffic than the desolate\r\ntableland.\r\n\r\n     [71] This was the area studied by the Commission of which\r\n     Bailey Willis was chairman.\r\n\r\nThe railway from San Antonio, and the road which is a continuation\r\nof it west of Maquinchao, cover a distance of 320 miles from the\r\nAtlantic to the Andes, and cross five distinct regions. The first is\r\nthe coastal plain, composed of horizontal marine Tertiary sedimentary\r\nrocks, both of sand and clay. The plain rises slowly toward the west,\r\nand it attains a height of 650 feet at a distance of seventy miles\r\nfrom the coast. This coastal platform divides, on the north-west,\r\nthe enclosed hollow of the Bajo del Gualicho from the Gulf of San\r\nAntonio. Its surface is very even. The gravel on it has formed a sort\r\nof conglomerate, and in spite of appearances, this gravelly soil is\r\nnot bad for vegetation. It quickly absorbs the rain-water, which thus\r\nescapes evaporation. The vegetation is comparatively rich. There are\r\nno springs, but the autumn rains sustain _manantiales_ in the marly\r\nsurface, and these do not dry up until the spring. During the summer\r\nthe plain is deserted, and there is no water. But the flocks return in\r\nthe winter and remain there until spring. There is very little snow, as\r\nthe temperature is moderate. In spite of the density of the pastoral\r\npopulation in winter, the pasturage is not injured. The grass grows\r\nplentifully amongst the thickets. This is because the flocks leave\r\nthe district before the season when the grasses flower and reproduce,\r\nso the next generation is secured. Part of the flocks which winter\r\non the coastal plain pass the summer in the south-west, on the high\r\nbasaltic tablelands of Somuncura. However, the whole of the surface of\r\nthe tableland cannot be used permanently, or during the entire summer.\r\nThere is plenty of water in spring, when the snows have melted. In the\r\nmiddle of the summer the flocks collect round the permanent springs,\r\nand they scatter once more over the mountain pastures during the autumn\r\nrains, before they return to the plain.\r\n\r\nThe second region is that of Valcheta. From Aguada Cecilia to Corral\r\nChico the railway follows for sixty miles the edge of the outpour of\r\nlava from the south, which covers the Tertiary clays. In front of the\r\nbasalt cliff the land dips in the north toward a closed depression, the\r\nBajo de Valcheta, the bottom of which consists of clays impregnated\r\nwith salt. Tertiary marine strata surround this hollow in the west and\r\nnorth, where they divide it from the Bajo del Gualicho, but here they\r\nform only a thin skin which covers the crystalline platform. The line\r\nof contact of the basalt and the Tertiary marls is marked by a series\r\nof good springs, and these give rise to permanent streams, such as the\r\nArroyo Valcheta and the Nahuel Niyeu. At first they flow in a narrow\r\nvalley crowned by basalts, with peaty prairies at the bottom, then over\r\nTertiary marls, and, in the latitude of the railways, they pass into a\r\ngorge cut through the granites before losing themselves to the north in\r\nthe _salitral_. A small agricultural oasis is sustained by the waters\r\nof the Valcheta.\r\n\r\nThe site of Valcheta has an exceptional importance in the story of\r\nPatagonian colonization. It marks a necessary stage in the Indian track\r\nfrom the Atlantic to Nahuel Huapi, which is now followed by the line\r\nof the railway. Musters halted there. The track from Choele Choel, on\r\nthe Rio Negro, to the southern coast and the Santa Cruz also passed\r\nby there. It was so much used, says Ezcurra, that the hoofs of the\r\nhorses had hollowed it.[72] The Argentine village dates from 1890.\r\nAt first it lived by supplying fodder to the convoys of wagons which\r\ncarried the wool. The railway has suppressed this traffic, and the only\r\noutlet of the oasis to-day is the small port of San Antonio, where the\r\nwool is shipped, and where the district is unsuitable for any kind of\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n     [72] Pedro Ezcurra, \"Camino indio entre los rios Negro\r\n     y Chubut: la travesia de Valcheta,\" _Bol. Instit. Geog.\r\n     Argent._, xix. 1898, pp. 134-38.\r\n\r\nLike the coast region, the Valcheta district seems marked out by its\r\nmoderate altitude to serve as winter pasture. In point of fact, it\r\nis used during the whole year. The springs do not dry up in summer.\r\nThe streams which flow from the south toward the Bajo de Valcheta are\r\npermanent. In addition, a few wells have been bored in the Tertiary\r\nstrata. Contrary to experience on the coast, therefore, cattle can be\r\nkept here during the summer. There is less chance for the grasses to\r\nreproduce, and the pasture tends to become impoverished.\r\n\r\nThe third zone, 130 miles from the coast, is that of the tableland\r\nof the Cerros Colorados, where low masses of red granite rise like\r\nan archipelago amongst the Tertiary formations deposited in the\r\nintervening depressions. In the west its altitude rises from 650 to\r\n1,300 feet. It is one of the poorest parts of the tableland, and the\r\nsize of the flock is reduced to 600 head to the square league. The\r\nnaked rock crops up, not covered, as it is further east, by a bed of\r\ngravel. In the valleys there is little water, and it lies very deep.\r\nThere are no periodical removals of the animals. Winter and summer they\r\nremain within range of a few poor springs, which are caused by various\r\noutcrops of lava of limited extent; and they leave these, and wander\r\nover the tableland, only in the rainy season.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Cerros Colorados the line rises rapidly, and at Maquinchao\r\nit reaches the basin of Lake Carilaufquen. This occupies the bottom of\r\na closed depression, at an altitude of 3,000 feet, dominated on every\r\nside by a plateau of lava, toward which, in the south, a number of\r\nimportant valleys run (Nahuel Niyeu, Quetriquile, Maquinchao). These\r\nvalleys rise in the south in the basalt plateau, at a height of 4,000\r\nand 4,700 feet, and have no running water except at their upper ends.\r\nSouth of Carilaufquen they open upon a broad plain, round which there\r\nis a sombre cornice of lava, about 350 feet high. Water has collected\r\non the plain, which consists of alluvial beds redistributed by wind:\r\nangular pebbles from the terraces, fine dust from the _mallinas_, and\r\nsand from the dunes round the lake.\r\n\r\nThis region is much better than that of the Cerros Colorados. There\r\nare many springs at the base of the lava-flows, on the sides of\r\nthe valleys, and it has as yet not been necessary to look for the\r\nsubterranean sheets which accompany some of the valleys. The elevated\r\nbasin of the Quetriquile, though it is only occupied by _intrusos_,\r\nseems to have a particularly high pastoral density, and, I am told,\r\nfeeds 500,000 sheep. In the western part of the region the spring\r\nis late, and there is risk of snow during the lambing season. There\r\nare, however, no rams there; the lambs are brought from Maquinchao.\r\nThis arrangement of special zones for the multiplication of the flock\r\nenables them rapidly to improve the breed. Here again there are no\r\nremovals of the animals to a great distance in order to use the\r\npasture. The vegetation of the valleys suffered from the continuous\r\npresence of the flocks during the years of drought before 1914; the\r\nreproduction of useful grasses was prevented. There is, however, less\r\ndanger here than on the Cerros Colorados, because the _mallinas_ are\r\nextensive, and they suffice for feeding the sheep during the periods\r\nwhen the _manantiales_ of the tableland dry up, and the animals are\r\nconfined to the valleys.\r\n\r\nThe fifth region comprises the high ridge which divides the basin of\r\nthe Carilaufquen from Nahuel Huapi, the water of which flows northward\r\ntoward the Limay and southward toward the Chubut: successive eruptions\r\nhave covered the surface with lava and ash, which at Añecon rise to a\r\nheight of 6,700 feet. The granite platform which emerges in the north,\r\nat the Cerro Aspero and the Quadradito, rises to a height of 4,400 and\r\n4,700 feet, and in some places presents a bold and rejuvenated aspect.\r\nThe whole has been cut up in all directions by erosion, and it affords\r\ncomparatively easy means of getting about, which the Indian tracks have\r\nfollowed. Below the higher slopes the valleys deepen into gorges, and\r\nthese broaden out in the soft tufa and are lost at the cross-streams\r\nof lava or the outcrops of the granite. In so varied a land, with\r\nsuch marked differences of altitude, the winter and summer pastures\r\nare always close together. Precipitation is more plentiful than at a\r\ndistance from the Cordillera; the pasturage is richer, and the size\r\nof the flock rises to 1,600 sheep to the league. The sheep pass the\r\nwinter on the lower slopes, where they are sheltered from the winds and\r\nthe snow. They descend to the _mallin_ when the dry season sets in and\r\nmakes the soil firm. In summer they go on to the tablelands, where the\r\npastures extend to a height of 5,000 feet.\r\n\r\nBailey Willis, studying the improvements that might be made in the\r\npastoral processes, concluded that the essential point was to use each\r\npasturage in its best season, and establish a carefully considered\r\nrotation on the various lands. This system, which alone would enable\r\nthem to nurse the natural resources of the scrub in the way of plants\r\nfor fodder, is used to-day in only a small number of districts--in\r\nthe east, where the flocks winter on the coastal plain and spend the\r\nsummer on the Somuncura tableland, and in the west, round the Añecon,\r\nwhere the summer and winter pastures are not far from each other. The\r\ncustom ought to be general. The area which ought to be reserved for\r\nwinter pasture comprises the coastal plains, the whole of the low-lying\r\ndistrict round Valcheta, and the lower part of the valleys to the\r\nsouth of the Carilaufquen. They are less extensive than the available\r\nsummer pastures, but their capacity could be enlarged by developing\r\nthe irrigated areas in the Bajo de Valcheta, and sowing lucerne in the\r\n_mallinas_ of the basin of the Carilaufquen. The low valleys round the\r\nCarilaufquen ought to be reserved for winter pasture. In the summer the\r\nsheep would be taken south to the higher-level valleys, which afford\r\npermanent pasture. From there they would spread after the melting of\r\nthe snow, and after the first rains in autumn, over the high tablelands\r\nwhich surround them.\r\n\r\nThis plan is obstructed in the first place by the actual terms of\r\nownership, which were imprudently fixed before the examination of the\r\ncountry in detail had been concluded. Thus the Maquinchao ranch, in the\r\nlower valley, does not own the upper valley with the summer pastures\r\nthat ought to belong to it. A more serious obstacle is that it is\r\nextremely difficult to remove the sheep. It is not merely roads that\r\nare wanting, but a water supply at the various stages.[73]\r\n\r\n     [73] The district of the Rio Negro is not the only part of\r\n     Patagonia which faces the problem of increasing the winter\r\n     pasture. Attention has been drawn to the possibility of\r\n     enlarging the lucerne farms in the district of Colonia\r\n     Sarmiento, south of Lake Musters, and making this a great\r\n     wintering area for the Santa Cruz flocks.\r\n\r\nBetween the railway that runs from San Antonio to Lake Nahuel Huapi and\r\nthe Rio Negro, there is a desert region about seventy miles in width.\r\nRed sandstone predominates in it, and it remains uninhabited. North of\r\nthis _travesia_ the valley of the Rio Negro opens. Its width between\r\nNeuquen and Patagones ranges from five to fifteen miles. Its slope\r\ndiminishes gradually toward the bottom (from 0.67 to 0.49 per 1,000\r\nabove Chelfaro; from 0.45 to 0.29 per 1,000 above Conesa).\r\n\r\nThe sandstone and marl cliffs which enclose it become gradually lower\r\nas one goes downward. They dominate the valley at a height of 650 feet\r\nat the confluence of the Neuquen, and are only 100 to 130 feet high at\r\nPatagones. At the foot of them are broad terraces cut by dissymetrical\r\nravines, in which the beds of sandstone outcrop on the western slope,\r\nexposed to the winds, while the eastern slopes are covered with\r\ngravel. On the banks of the river there is a strip about two miles\r\nwide with abundant herbaceous vegetation between lines of willows.\r\nThis is covered by the normal floods. The remainder of the river\r\nplain, to the foot of the cliffs, has only a thin scrub, with dunes at\r\nintervals. Saline clays here overlie the river gravels. The level of\r\nthe underground water, which is fed by the river, sinks lower as one\r\ngoes from the banks toward the cliffs. Few parts of the tableland have\r\nso desolate an aspect as the bottom of these great Patagonian valleys,\r\nwhen they have not been transformed by irrigation. The pasturage is\r\npoor. At Conesa, however, the valley (_costa_) is used as summer\r\npasture when there is a shortage of water on the surrounding tableland\r\n(_planeza_).\r\n\r\nThe water-supply is good, the volume of the river ranging from 200\r\nto 900 cubic metres a second. Low water lasts from February to April\r\n(end of the summer). From May to July the river has sudden and violent\r\nfloods--an effect of the autumn rains. The curve sinks again in August\r\nand September, to rise once more in October and December, when the\r\nsnow melts on the Andes. The Limay, the upper basin of which contains\r\nlarge, lacustrine sheets, is more regular than the Neuquen, which has\r\nvery pronounced low-water, as well as dangerous floods in the autumn.\r\nThe first attempts at irrigation date from 1885, when the canal of the\r\nRoca colony was dug. Others were made lower down at a later date. The\r\nco-operative groups organized for the administration of the canals have\r\nnot been quite as successful as might have been expected. The advance\r\nof agricultural colonization has been slow. Costly preparatory work is\r\nneeded to level the ground and organize the drainage, otherwise saline\r\npatches form and spread like leprosy at the expense of the cultivable\r\nareas. Lastly, the centre of the valley is exposed to floods.[74]\r\n\r\n     [74] The work now (1914) in hand will reduce the risk of\r\n     floods, and will enable them to enlarge considerably the\r\n     extent of the tilled land. The Cuenca Vidal, which opens\r\n     amongst the sandstone, below the level of the valley, on the\r\n     tableland to the north of the Neuquen, will be arranged so as\r\n     to absorb the flood-water, and it will feed a canal which will\r\n     serve the left bank over an area of 100 miles. The waters of\r\n     the Limay will be available for the lower valley.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE PATAGONIAN TABLELAND (NEUQUEN).\r\n  _Indigenous vegetation.

To face p. 154.]\r\n\r\nThe chief crops are lucerne, cereals, and the vine. All the efforts and\r\nhopes of the colonists are now centred upon the vine. It is for the\r\npurpose of extending the vineyards that they are endeavouring to secure\r\nmore workers. These are a singularly mixed lot, Chileans from the\r\nNeuquen rubbing shoulders with Latin immigrants (Italian and Spanish)\r\nfrom the region of the Pampas.\r\n\r\nThe lucerne is made up in bales and exported by rail to Bahía Blanca\r\nand Buenos Aires. The economic life of the agricultural oasis of the\r\nRio Negro is no more connected with that of the pastoral tableland\r\nthan is life on the Chubut. Neither sheep nor cattle are fattened on\r\nthe Rio Negro. It is a curious contrast to the spectacle offered by\r\nthe Andean regions of western and north-western Argentina, where for\r\ngenerations there has been a close association between the breeding\r\nindustry of the scrub and the fattening on the lucerne-farms. This is\r\nbecause the currents of the cattle-trade are not here as permanent and\r\nstable as they are in the north. The time when the convoys of Pampean\r\ncattle bound for Chile used the valley of the Rio Negro preceded the\r\nagricultural colonization of the banks of the river. The conquest\r\nof Patagonia put an end to this traffic. There was an interval of\r\ntwenty-five years between the period of the export of Pampean cattle\r\nto Chile and the export of cattle from the Neuquen to Buenos Aires,\r\nto which I will refer presently. As to sheep-breeding, it did not for\r\na long time rear the animals for the meat-market, and it is only a\r\nfew years since it found transport necessary. The farmers of the Rio\r\nNegro, who have little capital, and who sell and are paid in advance\r\nfor their dry fodder, have not yet been able to take advantage of the\r\nreorganization of the cattle-trade.\r\n\r\nWest of the confluence of the Neuquen and the Limay the railway ascends\r\nthe sandstone tableland, from 1,700 to 3,000 feet high, and goes as\r\nfar as the foot of the first sub-Andean chain, the Zapala ranch. The\r\neruptive rocks here have thrown up the sandstone, and the profiles\r\nraised north and south of Zapala, across the Sierra de la Vaca Muerta\r\nand the Cerro Lotena, cut through folds of Mesozoic strata which have\r\nbeen reduced by erosion to the level of the plateau. One already feels\r\nthe vicinity of the Cordillera. Pasture is plentiful, the _mallin_\r\nis thick, and springs abound. The sheep-area stretches westward of\r\nZapala, as far as the Rio Cataluin and the Rio Agrio. East of Zapala,\r\non the other hand, the desolate condition of the country gets worse\r\nand worse. The supplies of water dry up in the summer, and the entire\r\nzone that lies east of 70° W. long. is useless, on account of the lack\r\nof permanent water, except as winter commonage. Hence, transhumation\r\nis here indispensable. It has been practised for a long time on the\r\nChilean slope of the Cordillera from the latitude of Coquimbo and San\r\nJuan to the north of Lake Quillen. At present it tends to disappear\r\nfrom the Andes of the Neuquen.[75] But there is still transhumation on\r\nthe Argentine side. The sheep of the plateau, driven from their winter\r\npasture when the water dries up, ascend the Cordillera. Sometimes the\r\nmountains are not yet free from snow. In that case the journey is\r\ndelayed, and the sheep feed on the way, to the great detriment of the\r\nland they cross.\r\n\r\n     [75] As a matter of fact, of recent years there has been a\r\n     practice on this slope of disguising the smuggling of animals\r\n     under the name of \"transhumation,\" as the removal of the sheep\r\n     facilitated it and helped to maintain it. The shepherds got\r\n     certificates exaggerating the number of their sheep from the\r\n     Chilean officials before they crossed the frontier, and under\r\n     cover of these they came back to Chile with additions to their\r\n     flocks which they had bought on Argentine territory.\r\n\r\nThere are many routes, and frequently they coincide with those which\r\nwere formerly taken by the cattle of the Pampas in ascending to the\r\npasses of the Cordillera. Groeber mentions a transhumation track south\r\nof the Rio Barrancas and Lake Carri Lauquen. From the left bank of the\r\nNeuquen the flocks ascend by Chosmalal and Butamallin to the pasture\r\nof the Pichachen pass, or by Las Lajas to the Pino Hachado pass. From\r\nZapala and the tableland further south they go to spend the summer\r\nin the Cataluin Cordillera, where the number of sheep in summer is\r\ncalculated to be 70,000. Others go still further, to the source of the\r\nAlumine and the Arco pass. The volcano Lanin almost marks the southern\r\nlimit of the zone of transhumation. The chief group of migrating sheep\r\ncomes from the district of the Coyunco, the Cañadon Grande, and the\r\nPicun Leucu.\r\n\r\nTranshumation is practised only by the _intrusos_. They go from the\r\nunowned lands of the tableland to the unowned lands of the Cordillera.\r\nThe renting of winter pasture to owners is quite exceptional. The\r\nconcessions of land granted by the Argentine Government are steadily\r\nreducing the area of the migrators in the Cordillera, and also the\r\nways of communication between the tableland and the mountains. The\r\nproprietors do not care to receive the migrating flocks, and they\r\nput obstacles in their way by enclosing the land. The routes of the\r\ntranshumation are now fixed by the spaces which remain open between the\r\nenclosed ranches. Moreover, the migrating _intrusos_ are haunted by\r\nthe fear of finding the winter pasture occupied by others during their\r\nabsence, and they have no proprietary title. The splitting up of the\r\nland and the organization of ownership will before long lead to the\r\nextinction of the practice of transhumation, and the greater part of\r\nthe winter pasturage will be turned into permanent pasture by boring\r\nwells and nursing the water-supply.\r\n\r\nThe district round the Zapala ranch has become very busy since the\r\nconstruction of the railway, which has deeply affected the conditions\r\nof life there. It has made a sort of capital of Zapala. It is curious\r\nto contrast the renaissance which has followed upon the appearance of\r\nthe railway in this district with the much less material changes which\r\nit has made at Maquinchao. The life which the railway concentrates at\r\nZapala includes not only the wool trade, as at Maquinchao, but also\r\nthe cattle trade. The herds which are to be exported gather round the\r\nranch at the same time as the _tropas_ of wagons, and a good price is\r\npaid for the right of pasturage. While the Maquinchao line ends at the\r\nport of San Antonio, which is merely fitted up for the export of wool,\r\nthe Zapala railway feeds the refrigerator at Bahía Blanca. It joins up\r\nwith the network of railways of the Pampa. Sheep arrive at Zapala, not\r\nonly from the surrounding district and from the Neuquen, but from a\r\ngood part of the Rio Negro, and even the Chubut. The convoys of animals\r\ncoming from the south find it best to keep near the Cordillera, where\r\nthe pasturage is better. Only a few of them descend the Limay as far\r\nas Senillosa. From Zapala to Senillosa there is no suitable road in\r\nconnection with the railway, and further east it is necessary to go as\r\nfar as Choele Choel to find tracks which lead to it. The exporting of\r\nthe sheep lasts five months, from November to March.\r\n\r\nZapala station is also a point of convergence of herds of cattle.\r\nThere are people at Zapala who still remember the time when the cattle\r\nbrought from the Pampa to go to Chile passed through their valley.\r\nAlthough these exports of Pampean cattle to Chile ceased after 1885,\r\nthe whole Andean region of the Neuquen still lived entirely on the\r\nChilean market until very recently. The attraction of the Chilean\r\nmarket is one of the reasons for the survival of transhumation. It was\r\nto the advantage of the Argentine breeders to keep near the Cordillera\r\nand the passes through which the buyers came from Chile in the summer.\r\nThe life of the small centres in the upper valleys which developed\r\nrapidly after the conquest (Chosmalal, Ñorquin, Codihue, Junin, and\r\nSan Martin) was bound up with the Chilean cattle trade, and was\r\nreflected on the opposite side of the Andes in the prosperity of the\r\ncorresponding markets in Chile.\r\n\r\nIn the years immediately preceding 1914, a sudden revolution upset\r\nthe cattle traffic on the Neuquen, and the attraction of Buenos Aires\r\ntook the place of that of the Chilean market. The commercial influence\r\nof Buenos Aires was first felt in the wool-market. The _tropas_ of\r\nwagons which brought wool to Zapala loaded up, in exchange, with the\r\nflour and salt that were needed for sheep-breeding in the pastures\r\nof the Cordillera (_pastos dulces_). The import trade followed the\r\npath traced by the export trade. The small Chilean wagons which still\r\ncross the Cordillera now only bring to the Neuquen the coarse flour of\r\nChile, haricot beans, and wine. They return empty to Chile. After the\r\nwool-buyers, the cattle-merchants of Buenos Aires next found their way\r\nto the Cordillera. The centres where the sales of cattle for Chile used\r\nto be held are now in decay, and have lost part of their population.\r\nThe cattle are sent to the fattening centres on the Pampa, or to the\r\nBahía Blanca and Buenos Aires markets. Thus we have under our eyes,\r\nunexpectedly, in the north of Patagonia a transformation that occurred\r\ngradually half a century ago in all the western and north-western parts\r\nof Argentina. In its many forms it is the essential fact in the modern\r\nhistory of Argentine colonization. The more distant provinces are\r\ndetached in succession from foreign markets, and the whole national\r\nlife is being organized round the great economic focus which the region\r\nof the Pampas has become.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PLAIN OF THE PAMPAS\r\n\r\n     The limits of the prairie--The rains--The wind and the\r\n     formation of the clay of the Pampas--The wind and the\r\n     contour--The zones of colonization on the Pampas--Hunting\r\n     wild cattle and primitive breeding--The sheep-farms--The\r\n     ranches--The region of \"colonies\"--The region of lucerne,\r\n     maize, and wheat--The combination of agriculture and\r\n     breeding--The economic mechanism of colonization--The\r\n     exchanges between the different zones of the Pampas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pampean landscape is doubtless one of the most uniform in the\r\nworld. Its monotony is tiring to the eye; it is partly responsible for\r\nthe mediocrity of most of the descriptions of the Pampas. But this\r\nuniformity is an advantage for the purpose of colonization. Attention\r\nhas often been drawn to the rapidity with which plants and animals\r\nintroduced by Europeans spread in the Buenos Aires district, and,\r\npushing ahead of the breeders and farmers, colonized the Pampas. In the\r\nsecond half of the nineteenth century, when the whole extent of the\r\nplain beyond the ancient Indian frontier was occupied, the development\r\nof it was so much easier because it was possible to use simpler and\r\nmore uniform methods of exploitation. It needed neither large capital\r\nnor long personal experience on the part of the immigrant. Basques\r\nand Italians who had only just landed could take an active part in it\r\nalmost without apprenticeship. The primitive groups of population could\r\nadvance from one zone of the plain to another and take with them their\r\nown methods of farming and breeding, their own form of rural economy.\r\n\r\nA close study will, however, enable us to detect appreciable physical\r\ndifferences in the Pampean plain. Neither climate nor soil is the same\r\nall over it.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Pampa\" chiefly means a vegetal growth, a prairie. Its\r\nlimits are the frontier of the scrub (_monte_), and strange as it may\r\nseem, it is still difficult to trace them exactly. North of Santa\r\nFé, between the Salado and the Paraná, the Pampa stretches as far as\r\nFives-Lille, a little beyond 30° S. lat.[76] On the Central Norte\r\nand the Central Argentine lines the fringe of the _monte_ reaches to\r\nFuertin Inca and Malbran, about 170 miles north-west of Santa Fé. It\r\nthen turns south-east and south, passing round the entire depression of\r\nLos Porongos and Mar Chiquita; and the line from Santa Fé to Córdoba\r\ncrosses it at Francia and approaches the Rio Secundo. South of the Rio\r\nSecundo it goes westward and joins the foot of the Sierra de Córdoba\r\nsouth of the Rio Tercero (at the stream Tequia). From this point to La\r\nCambre, some sixteen miles east of San Luis, the prairie extends as far\r\nas the edge of the sierras, and penetrates into the southern half of\r\nthe Conlara depression, between the hills of Córdoba and of San Luis\r\n(Pampa de Naschel). The mimosa forest enters the steppe in narrow belts\r\nalong the Rio Quinto to within a few leagues below Villa Mercedes,\r\nalong the Rio Tercero as far as the confluence of the Saladillo, and\r\nalong the Salado to the south of Santa Fé. There are, in addition, many\r\nisolated clumps of _chañares_ and more extensive patches of wood in\r\nthe north-west corner of the prairie (Santa Fé province). The _monte_\r\nalong the Salado is continued south of Santa Fé along the Paraná, as\r\nfar as the point where the chief arm of the river reaches the cliffs\r\non the right bank, at San Lorenzo. This is the domain of the _ombu_, a\r\ntree with thick trunk and naked roots which is found scattered over the\r\nprairie in the Paraná region as far as south of Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\n     [76] On the left bank of the Salado, west of the Resistencia\r\n     railway, a great gulf of low prairie penetrates into the\r\n     forest of the Chaco in the north, almost as far as 28° S.\r\n     lat., but it has rather the character of one of the floodable\r\n     clearings of the Chaco (_esteros_) than of the temperate\r\n     Pampa.\r\n\r\nIn the west, between San Luis and the mouth of the Colorado, the\r\ntransition from the Pampa to the _monte_ is gradual. Just as at Santa\r\nFé, the approach of the _monte_ is announced by the appearance of\r\n_chañares_, in the south-west corner of the Córdoba province and on\r\nthe southern slope of the Sierra de la Ventana. The _monte_, properly\r\nso called, though impoverished, invaded by the _jarilla_, and mainly\r\ncomposed (as in northern Patagonia) of dwarf mimosas, covers the area\r\nof the Pampean sierras on the left bank of the Chadi Leuvu and the\r\nColorado. Between this area and a line passing through Rancul, Anguil,\r\nAtreuco, and Bernasconi, where the naked prairie begins, there is a\r\nmixed zone which one may call the _calden_ zone. This mimosa, a near\r\nrelative of the _algarroba_, which has a wider range than the other\r\nplants of the _monte_ in this latitude, forms woods at intervals in\r\nthe south of the San Luis province and on the flanks of the parallel\r\nvalleys of the central Pampa. Between these woods the tableland\r\nis generally covered by the prairie, with occasional patches of\r\n_chañares_. About twenty-five miles east of Buena Esperanza the line\r\nfrom San Rafael touches the far corner of a forest of _caldenes_, which\r\nstretches south-westward, and reaches the Rio Salado about 35° 30'\r\nS. lat. Beyond Buena Esperanza it keeps on the prairie as far as the\r\ncrossing of the Salado, which here marks the limit of the _monte_. The\r\nRio Negro line passes directly from the prairie to the Patagonian scrub\r\nmid-way between Bahía Blanca and the Colorado.\r\n\r\nWithin these limits the prairie extends without a break. The sierras of\r\nthe Buenos Aires province have no arborescent vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe zone of the prairie, intermediate between tropical Argentina and\r\nthe sub-desert regions of western Patagonia, has a medium rainfall. It\r\ndecreases gradually from north-east to south-west. There is a rainfall\r\nof 1,200 to 1,000 millimetres on the lower Paraná, and only 400 to\r\n600 millimetres on the western edge of the Pampa. The zone which lies\r\nbetween the 800 millimetres and 600 millimetres average is more than\r\n270 miles in breadth. But what is most characteristic of the climate\r\nof the Pampa is the equal distribution of the rain throughout the\r\nyear, and the absence of a real dry season. In this the Pampa differs\r\nfrom the surrounding regions, both in the south-west and the north.\r\nAt Buenos Aires the six months of the (relatively) dry season yield,\r\nnevertheless, 44 per cent. of the total rainfall, and at Bahía Blanca\r\n40 per cent. This regularity diminishes in proportion as one approaches\r\nthe coast. At Rosario the six months of the dry season only yield 30\r\nper cent. of the year's rain; at Villa Mercedes (San Luis province) 25\r\nper cent. When one goes beyond the limits of the prairies the ratio\r\nof rain in the dry season decreases rapidly; it is only 20 per cent.\r\nat Córdoba and 18 per cent. at San Luis. At Córdoba, the curve of the\r\nrainfall indicates a typical tropical regime, with a summer maximum\r\nand a very low minimum in winter. Passing south-eastward from Córdoba,\r\nat Bellville, Villa Maria and especially Rosario, the dryness of the\r\nwinter diminishes, and at the same time a secondary minimum appears\r\nin the middle of summer (January-February). At Buenos Aires, the form\r\nof the curve changes completely. The summer minimum is almost as low\r\nas the winter minimum, and most of the rainfall is in the spring\r\n(September) and the beginning of the autumn (March).[77]\r\n\r\n     [77] Argentine Mesopotamia, which is a continuation of the\r\n     Pampean region from the climatological point of view, is also,\r\n     even in its northern part, without the rigorous dry seasons of\r\n     the Chaco. Ascending the Paraná, from Corrientes to Posadas,\r\n     just as in passing from Córdoba to Buenos Aires, one notices\r\n     that the winter minimum decreases, and a secondary maximum\r\n     appears in the spring. The predominance of the spring rains,\r\n     which is a characteristic of southern Brazil, is conspicuous\r\n     on the middle Uruguay. On the lower part of that river the\r\n     rain-system approaches that of Buenos Aires, with maxima\r\n     in spring and autumn, a principal minimum in winter, and a\r\n     secondary minimum in summer.\r\n\r\nThese various shades of the Pampean climate are of essential importance\r\nin the history of colonization and the spread of cultivation. The belt\r\nof summer rain is the belt of maize-growing, whereas the cultivation of\r\nwheat requires spring rain and a comparatively dry summer.\r\n\r\nWhile the isohyetic curves, which represent the precipitation for the\r\nwhole year, are orientated from north-west to south-east, the curves of\r\nrainfall during the cold season, from April to September (dry season\r\nin the north), cut diagonally across the preceding, and are oriented\r\ndirectly north and south. Bahía Blanca receives in winter as much rain\r\nas Rosario, and General Acha (in the district of the central Pampa)\r\nas much as Córdoba. Unless one attends to this, one cannot explain\r\nthe extension of wheat-growing, in the south-west, as far as the 400\r\nmillimetre curve, and even beyond it on the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe relief of the Pampean plain is known fairly accurately, thanks\r\nto the observations made along the railways. The ground rises slowly\r\ntoward the west. The 100-metre curve describes a deep gulf some 300\r\nmiles west-south-west of Buenos Aires. The belt comprised between 100\r\nand 150 metres above sea-level is more than sixty miles broad in the\r\nlatitude of Santa Fé, and 130 miles in the latitude of Buenos Aires.\r\nBeyond the 150-metre curve the land rises rapidly toward the west and\r\nnorth-west, and reaches 400 metres in the Córdoba district and 500 in\r\nthe Villa Mercedes district. It is at the altitude of 150 metres, and\r\nthe break in the inclination which this marks, that the Rio Quinto is\r\nlost, near Amarga, south of General Lavalle.\r\n\r\nThe ridge between the Pampa and the basin of the Salado in the south\r\nof the San Luis province is about 450 metres above sea-level. South of\r\nthe province of Buenos Aires the Sierras de Tandil and de la Ventana\r\nare joined together by a ridge which does not fall below 200 metres.\r\nCertain irregularities of the surface, such as the depression of Mar\r\nChiquita to the east of Córdoba, the thrust of the plateau on the right\r\nbank of the Paraná, south of Villa Constitución and San Nicolas, can,\r\napparently, only be explained by recent tectonic movements.\r\n\r\nThe Pampean deposits which cover the plain rest upon a rocky base of\r\nwhich the salient representatives are the sierras of the province of\r\nBuenos Aires and the hills at Córdoba and San Luis. This base also\r\nappears east of the Pampean basin in the granite island of Martin\r\nGarcia, in the middle of the estuary of the Plata, and in the hills on\r\nthe coast of Uruguay.[78]\r\n\r\n     [78] While the Pampean deposits lie immediately on the\r\n     crystalline and Paleozoic formations in the sierras of the\r\n     lower Colorado and of the central Pampa, in the south of the\r\n     province of Buenos Aires and in Uruguay, they are, on the\r\n     eastern edge of the Sierra de Córdoba, separated from it by\r\n     red sandstones and conglomerates of uncertain age, perhaps\r\n     synchronous with the continental red sandstones of Corrientes\r\n     which outcrop east of the Paraná and have been known since\r\n     D'Orbigny's time as \"granitic sandstones.\"\r\n\r\nUnderneath the even sheet of the alluvial deposits the surface of the\r\nsub-Pampean platform is very irregular. Its shape has been discovered\r\nby deep borings in search of arterial waters. It has been warped and\r\ncut up by faults, some of these deformations being probably synchronous\r\nwith the formation of the Pampean deposits which have concealed them\r\nas they have been produced. A subterranean rocky ridge continues the\r\nSierra de Córdoba southward and joins it with the sierras of the\r\nColorado. The granite emerges at Chamaico, on the western railway, and\r\non both sides the borings have passed through great depths of clay and\r\nsand.[79] This ridge isolates the eastern Pampa from the sub-Andean\r\nchains, and marks the limit of the area with sheets of underground\r\nwater. In the north of the Pampean region, between the Sierra de\r\nCórdoba and the Paraná, the loose continental formations are more than\r\n2,000 feet thick at Bellville, and more than 3,500 feet north-west of\r\nSanta Fé (fodder farms of San Cristobal and El Tostado). At Buenos\r\nAires the granite has been found 985 feet below the surface.\r\n\r\n     [79] At Rancul, in the east, 660 feet of loess overlying red\r\n     sandstone: at Telen, in the west, 2,800 feet of sand, marl,\r\n     sandstone and gravel.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE PAMPEAN PLAIN.

To face p. 166.]\r\n\r\nThe Pampean formation consists almost entirely of loose deposits,\r\nsand and clays of various sorts. There is no gravel.[80] Even in the\r\nvicinity of the sierras the beds of gravel, with round or angular\r\npebbles, are almost always covered by clay, and are exposed only in the\r\nbanks of the streams. Olascoaga mentions the surprise of the _gauchos_\r\nof General Roca's army when they found Patagonian pebbles on the ground\r\nduring their stay at Choele Choel on the Colorado, in the course of\r\nthe campaign on the Rio Negro. Officers and soldiers dismounted to\r\npick them up. Sand and clay form a thick bed of continental alluvia.\r\nThe Tertiary maritime transgressions, which have left their mark in\r\nthe clays and limestones of the left bank of the lower Paraná, and the\r\nlayers of shells at San Pedro on the right bank, never penetrated far\r\ninto the interior of the Pampean region, and one finds no trace of them\r\nwhen one leaves the coast or the river.\r\n\r\n     [80] Roth claims to have found gravel in the San Nicolas\r\n     _barranca_ on the Paraná. I have myself found small rounded\r\n     flints in the clay of the Chaco at Tartagal. But these\r\n     deposits probably come from the left bank of the Paraná, where\r\n     the beds of river gravel are considerable.\r\n\r\nThe source of the elements which compose the Pampean alluvia is very\r\nuncertain. Their composition does not clearly show their origin. The\r\nclays are comparatively rich in calcareous matter, which seems to\r\nindicate that they do not come from tropical America or the upper basin\r\nof the Paraná. Wright and Fenner insist upon the high proportion of\r\nsiliceous glass of volcanic origin which they contain, which points\r\nto an intense eruptive activity during or before their formation.[81]\r\nDoering had already noticed in the Córdoba region the prevalence of\r\nbeds of volcanic ash, which become thicker as one approaches the\r\nsierra. It is certain that the Pampean sierras have had their share in\r\nthe formation of the Pampean beds. But the main mass is probably of\r\nAndean origin. However that may be, as soon as one gets away from the\r\nfringe of the mountains, the only variety noticeable in the lands of\r\nthe Pampa is that which they owe to the conditions in which they have\r\nbeen deposited.\r\n\r\n     [81] In Ales Hrdlicka, _Early Man in South America_\r\n     (Smithsonian Instit. Bull., 52, Washington, 1912).\r\n\r\nRiver deposits strictly so called, estuary deposits, lagoon deposits,\r\næolian deposits, æolian deposits redistributed by water, river deposits\r\nredistributed by wind--all these different types are represented in the\r\nPampean formation, but their relative importance is still disputed.[82]\r\n\r\n     [82] Many attempts have been made to classify the Pampean\r\n     lands, but the results cannot be regarded as final. Ameghino,\r\n     who is first and foremost a palæontologist, has done a service\r\n     in showing the futility of these geological divisions based\r\n     upon the actual surface of the deposits (colour, fineness,\r\n     etc.). But even palæontology gives rather uncertain results,\r\n     as it is impossible to recognize and follow step by step\r\n     the various stages of the movement of the fossils. All the\r\n     classifications of the Pampean are based upon a study of two\r\n     groups of sections. The first group comprises the cliff on\r\n     the right bank of the Paraná from Rosario to Buenos Aires\r\n     and the coastal cliff which is a continuation of it, with a\r\n     break from Enseñada at Mar Chiquita to Bahía Blanca. Ameghino\r\n     has recognized there a thick series of æolian deposits\r\n     separated by several discordances, the oldest elements of\r\n     which, at Bahía Blanca, belong to the Miocene. The second\r\n     group comprises the cliffs which enclose the valley of the Rio\r\n     Primero above and below Córdoba. Doering and Bodenbender in\r\n     this case describe two stages of æolian loess, each covered by\r\n     torrential gravel.\r\n\r\n     From the study of these sections geologists have drawn\r\n     certain conclusions as to the movements which have affected\r\n     the soil of the Pampa and the changes which the climate has\r\n     experienced. These conclusions have in each case only a local\r\n     value, and they have not yet been co-ordinated. The majority\r\n     of the observers, from Doering to Bailey Willis and Rovereto,\r\n     seem not to have taken into account sufficiently the fact that\r\n     in the continental formations the most diverse deposits may\r\n     come next to each other in the same series, according to the\r\n     particular process of deposition, and that their alternation\r\n     does not imply a general change in the conditions of erosion.\r\n\r\nWhen we confine ourselves to studying the actual conditions in which\r\nthe deposits were formed, we are first struck by the poverty of the\r\nhydrographic network of the Pampa. It is slight except in the vicinity\r\nof the sierras, where the slope of the ground is pronounced, and in the\r\neastern area, on the right bank of the Paraná and Entre Rios, where\r\nthe climate is more humid, and the streams flowing over an impermeable\r\nsoil more numerous. The only one of the streams born in the Pampean\r\nsierras that reaches the Paraná is the Rio Tercero or Carcaraña. All\r\nthe others dwindle as they descend, and disappear in a low-lying\r\ndistrict marked by lagoons which they only reach in time of flood. The\r\nfloods themselves never bring the Rio Cuarto and the Rio Quinto and the\r\nSalado de Buenos Aires into touch with each other. The waters of the\r\nnorthern slope of the Sierra de Tandil, and even those of the Sierra\r\nde Curumalal, on the other hand, reach the Salado after the rains,\r\neither by way of streams which drain the strings of lagoons, or by\r\nflood-sheets, which spread over large areas.\r\n\r\nThe watercourses of the plain are unstable in their direction. The\r\ntraces of their wanderings remain in the form of stretches of alluvial\r\nsand crossing the fine æolian clays. These river sands sometimes spread\r\nover extensive areas, the distribution depending upon a hydrographic\r\nscheme which is now partially effaced. The sands of the departments of\r\nGeneral Lopez (south of the Santa Fé province) and General Arenales\r\n(Buenos Aires province), where the Salado is now developed, were\r\nprobably brought by the Rio Cuarto, and mark an earlier junction of\r\nthe Cuarto and the Salado. These sands run along the Salado as far as\r\nthe confluence of the Saladillo, and the contrast between the light\r\nsoil and the clay of the bank of the Paraná is so striking that the\r\nsand has long been regarded as a marine deposit, indicating an ancient\r\nshore. Along the Saladillo also, north-west of the Guamini lagoons,\r\nthere is a sandy belt which corresponds with an important direction\r\ntaken by the actual flow of the river, crossing the Bolivar and Veinte\r\nCinco de Mayo departments.\r\n\r\nWhile the agency of running water in transporting alluvia is confined\r\nto certain sections of the plain, the action of the wind is seen over\r\nits entire surface. The wind everywhere supplements or replaces running\r\nwater. Like running water, it classifies the elements it conveys, and\r\nselects them according to their weight and size, the finest clays being\r\ndeposited in the moist eastern zone and the coarsest sands in the\r\nsub-desert zone of the west. The mechanism of erosion explains this\r\ncontrast. The grains of sand that are driven by the wind travel at the\r\nsurface of the ground as long as the vegetation is too sparse to fix\r\nthem. If one goes further east, to a moister district with a thicker\r\nvegetal carpet, the grains of sand no longer move at the surface of\r\nthe ground, but the wind still carries fine particles of clay, which\r\nit bears to a great height. The bed of clay does not at all imply an\r\narid climate, as is said sometimes, but corresponds to the region of\r\nthe steppes, with moderate rainfall. It is, however, during dry seasons\r\nthat the deposition of clay is at its greatest. Darwin mentions that\r\nafter the droughts of 1827-1830 in the area round the Paraná, the marks\r\nwere buried under dust to such an extent that one could no longer\r\nrecognize the limits of the various lands. Apart, however, from these\r\nsorts of floods or storms of dust caused by the _pampero_, the summer\r\natmosphere is clearly laden with dust, which colours the skies in the\r\neast of the Buenos Aires province, as far as Entre Rios.\r\n\r\nThe contour of the plain bears, like the soil, the double marks of\r\nerosion by running water and æolian erosion. The rivers of the Pampa,\r\nwhen they leave the sierras, flow between high cliffs, the height\r\ndiminishing as one goes downward. Presently these _barrancas_ become\r\nlow, approach each other, and at last merely mark the banks of a larger\r\nbed which the floods fill. There is no trace of valleys. Bailey Willis,\r\nsurprised at this weakness of watercourses that have, nevertheless, an\r\nappreciable fall, attributes it to the fact that the cycle of erosion\r\nopened by the last upheaval of the Pampa has not yet had time to\r\npenetrate into the interior. In reality, it means that here we are at\r\nthe limit of the zone of erosion by running water, and that in this\r\nclimate the essential factor in shaping the landscape is the wind.\r\n\r\nThe region of the right bank of the Paraná (east of the Salado),\r\nwhich alone has a complete hydrographic network, must be considered\r\napart. From the latitude of Rosario to that of Buenos Aires it is cut\r\nby flat-bottomed valleys which are sometimes a hundred feet deep.\r\nThe excavation of these valleys is due to an upheaval which raised\r\nthis part of the Pampa above the base-level. The rapids of the lower\r\nCarcaraña also bear witness to this resumption of excavation. Farther\r\non an inverse movement has put the bottom of the valleys below this\r\nlevel, and led to their being filled up (lagoon deposits of the\r\nLujanense of Ameghino). South of Buenos Aires the upheaval has been\r\nless important, and the valleys are not so deep. Some of them (middle\r\nSalado and its tributaries on the left bank) are now occupied by long\r\nlagoons with steep banks, branching along the side-valleys, and these\r\nowe their origin to the same negative movement, subsequent to the\r\nexcavation of the valleys. The upheaval did not extend to the eastern\r\npart of the province of Buenos Aires south of the Salado, a low-lying\r\nflat area, badly drained, exposed to floods, the contour of which has\r\nbeen minutely studied in connection with the construction of a great\r\nnetwork of drainage-canals. North of Rosario, on the only slightly\r\npermeable clay, the water circulates, after rain, not by means of\r\nvalleys in the proper sense, but along broad and almost imperceptible\r\ndepressions (_cañadas_) where the current is slow, and the water dries\r\nup in the dry season. Their general relations are not yet known.\r\n\r\nThe loose deposits of the Pampean offer little resistance to erosion.\r\nThe cycles are run through rapidly, and the traces of earlier cycles\r\nare faint, and are soon effaced.[83]\r\n\r\n     [83] Certain features of the hydrographic network clearly have\r\n     the character of having been superimposed: that is to say, the\r\n     path of the watercourses has been bequeathed to the actual\r\n     plain by former erosion-surfaces, which have now disappeared,\r\n     on which the valleys were originally imposed. That is why\r\n     in the district of the confluence of the Colorado and the\r\n     Chadi-Leuvu the valleys pass from Pampean deposits to the\r\n     crystalline sierras, which were at one time entirely covered\r\n     with water.\r\n\r\nAn ancient erosion-surface, dissected by the existing valleys, has\r\nsurvived in the south-west of the Pampean plain, thanks to the presence\r\non the surface of a sheet of hard limestone, the _tosca_. The _tosca_\r\nis the result of the concentration of calcareous elements contained\r\nin clay at the surface in a dry climate. The formation of it implies\r\na prolonged stability of the surface on which it has accumulated.\r\nLike the deep decomposition-soils in moister regions, it indicates\r\na peneplain on which erosion has ceased. The bed of _tosca_ covers\r\nthe whole district between the Sierra de Tandil and the Sierra de la\r\nVentana, the south-western slope of the Ventana, and most of the area\r\nof the central Pampa. In the north it does not go beyond the line from\r\nBuenos Aires to San Rafael. Its eastern limit goes almost by Ingeniero\r\nMalmen, Monte Nievas, and Atreuco, where it joins the southern bank of\r\nthe lagoons of Carhue and Guamini in the east.[84] In some places the\r\ntosca is about forty feet thick.\r\n\r\n     [84] In the vicinity of San Luis and Córdoba the hard strata\r\n     which are called _tosca_ are beds of eruptive ashes.\r\n\r\nTo-day the region of the _tosca_ forms a plateau cut by narrow valleys,\r\nsometimes 200 feet deep, west of the Sierra de la Ventana and in\r\nthe central Pampa. These parallel valleys, with few ramifications,\r\ngenerally lying south-west to north-east, open to the east upon the\r\nPampean plain about the frontier of the Buenos Aires province. On the\r\nother hand, the southernmost of them begin at the foot of the Ventana,\r\nand seem to blend in the south-west with a general depression that\r\nis still little known, though it appears to end at the bottom of the\r\nestuary of Bahía Blanca. None of them has permanent running water.[85]\r\nThe origin of the dry valleys of the _tosca_ is one of the most obscure\r\nproblems of the morphology of the Pampean plain. Perhaps they are due\r\nto æolian erosion, like the depressions which are found on the plateau\r\nof the Colorado and the Rio Negro further south.\r\n\r\n     [85] The surface of the _tosca_ tableland is further\r\n     punctuated by a great number of closed depressions of various\r\n     depths: long tunnels (_dolines_) which can only be explained,\r\n     apparently, as an effect of the dissolving of the limestone by\r\n     water.\r\n\r\nThe action of the wind in shaping the landscape is more clearly seen\r\nin the formation of the dunes. When one starts from Buenos Aires or\r\nRosario, and gets beyond the region of the level Pampas, the dunes are\r\nthe first feature to meet the eye on the surface of the plain. The\r\nfirst fresh dunes are encountered at Carlota, on the line from the Rio\r\nCuarto; at Lavalle on the line from Villa Mercedes; and at Trenque\r\nLauquen on the line from Toay. The dunes spread northward as far as the\r\nlatitude of Mar Chiquita, but do not enter the Chaco. They are also\r\nfound in parts of the scrub on the west, but their proper domain is the\r\nwestern border of the steppe, the upper part of the plain at the foot\r\nof the Sierra de Córdoba, the south of the San Luis province, and the\r\ncentral Pampa.\r\n\r\nAny accident that causes the vegetal covering to disappear, such as\r\nthe tread of cattle near a drinking place or an enclosure, is enough\r\nto set æolian erosion at work. The wind raises the sand in a sort of\r\ntossing sea. Then the dune assumes a circular shape. A depression\r\nappears in the centre, and it deepens until it reaches the average\r\nlevel of the plain. Frequently there is a little lake in it. From this\r\npoint onward the deformations are less rapid. The vegetation again\r\ncreeps over the ground, and the dune falls a prey to the rains, which\r\nslowly reduce its mass.\r\n\r\nIn the central Pampa, where the elevation is considerable, the dunes\r\ndo not form separate circular patches, but stretch in lines parallel\r\nto the valleys--sometimes in the heart of the valley, at other times\r\nbacking against one of its slopes.\r\n\r\nFar to the east of the zone of the quick dunes, in the south of the\r\nCórdoba province and the centre of the Buenos Aires province, there\r\nare certain soft undulations, covered with vegetation, with a sandier\r\nsoil than that of the plain around them. These are dead dunes. The\r\ndistrict of the dead dunes is characterized by the extreme irregularity\r\nof the surface-soil, the humus, which gains in richness and depth, as a\r\ngeneral rule, as one goes eastward, because there it is in some places\r\ncovered by recent æolian deposits.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the dead dunes is connected with the stretches of\r\nriver sand across the Pampa, which have offered an easy victim to the\r\nwinds. A line of dead dunes follows the upper course of the Salado in\r\nthe district of Junin and Bragado. On the line from Buenos Aires to San\r\nLuis one crosses it between Chacabuco and Vedia, and then one comes\r\nagain upon the horizontal plain, which has fresh dunes, only further\r\nwest, at 120 miles from Villa Mercedes. Its elevation is so conspicuous\r\non the level plain that the first breeders who used its pasturage gave\r\nit the emphatic name of the _cerillada_. D'Azara correctly appreciated\r\nthe nature of it. \"It is,\" he says, \"only a dune of very fine sand.\"\r\nIt is only a few yards high. The dead dunes of the Bolivar and Veinte\r\nCinco de Mayo departments, which Parchappe described, have a more\r\nconspicuous relief, and in their disposition sometimes remind us of\r\nthe fresh circular dunes with a central lagoon. The lines of coastal\r\ndunes in the eastern part of the Buenos Aires province obstruct the\r\nproper flow of the water there, and form a group apart, which must be\r\nclearly distinguished from the dunes on the plain.[86]\r\n\r\n     [86] Outside the districts with quick and dead dunes, a\r\n     frequent type of landscape on the Pampa is a plain thinly\r\n     sown with very small lagoons, generally circular, between\r\n     which develop a series of barely perceptible undulations. The\r\n     inequality is at times so slight that one only notices it\r\n     by the contrast between the vegetation of the lower and the\r\n     higher ground. This type of landscape, which is especially\r\n     seen in the district of Lincoln or of Nueve de Julio, is\r\n     due to the action of the wind on a plain where the level of\r\n     the underground water is near the surface. This level marks\r\n     a limit below which æolian erosion does not take place: a\r\n     sort of base-level. The periodic variations of level of the\r\n     underground water reduce or enlarge the undulations of the\r\n     surface.\r\n\r\nThus the impression of monotony which the Pampa makes in us is\r\ncorrected to some extent by close observation. High and low land\r\nalternate on it. Parchappe himself had noticed the contrast between\r\nthe area that stretches from Buenos Aires to the Salado, with its soft\r\nundulations and its well-developed hydrographic network, the horizontal\r\nplains on the right bank of the Salado, with their irregular dunes, and\r\nthe southern plateau of the _tosca_ between the Sierra de Tandil and\r\nthe Sierra de la Ventana.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may now distinguish the following regions in the Pampa as a whole:\r\n\r\n1. The central part of the Santa Fé province forms what is called\r\nthe district of the \"colonies\": that is to say, the domain of the\r\ncolonies established two generations ago, and the zone in which the\r\ntype of cultivation introduced by them took root. The chief crops here\r\nare wheat and flax. Hedges of service trees (_paraisos_) surround the\r\nfields. In contrast with the parts of the Pampa which have remained\r\nnaked, the region of the colonies seems a veritable grove. It stretches\r\nwestward beyond the frontier of the Córdoba province, and it reaches\r\nthe fringe of the _monte_ between San Francisco and Mar Chiquita.\r\nFor the north, Miatello gives 30° S. lat. as the normal limit of the\r\nwheat-growing area; beyond this it suffers both from the low rainfall\r\nof winter and the excessive rainfall in summer. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe large estates only reach this latitude on the line from San\r\nFrancisco to Ceres. On the Resistencia line, north of Santa Fé, they\r\nstop at 30° 30' S. lat. In the intervening district the limit of the\r\nregion of the colonies almost coincides with that of the department of\r\nCastellanos, about 30° 45' S. lat. The area lying between this line\r\nand the northern edge of the Pampa is given up to breeding. In the\r\nsouth the region of the colonies stretches as far as Las Bandurias and\r\nIrigoyen.\r\n\r\n2. South of the region of the colonies, the tableland on the right bank\r\nof the Paraná, west of Rosario and San Nicolas, is the maize region,\r\nthe corn belt of Argentina. Flax is generally cultivated as well as\r\nmaize. It is the agricultural country _par excellence_ of Argentina.\r\nThe soil, of fine clay, dark red in colour and retentive of moisture,\r\nand the abundant summer rains, are very suitable for maize. The limits\r\nof the maize region describe an arc of a circle round Rosario with a\r\nradius of 60 to 100 miles. They do not quite reach the frontier of\r\nCórdoba in the west, and they leave out the entire south-western corner\r\nof the Santa Fé province. The maize belt touches the Paraná between\r\n32° S. lat. and the Baradero. In the north it passes suddenly into the\r\nregion of the colonies. In the south, on the other hand, there is at\r\nthe edge of the corn belt an extensive transition-area, where maize and\r\nwheat occupy pretty much the same surface; it stretches as far as the\r\nRio Salado de Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\n3. The region of the lucerne farms is much larger. It comprises the\r\nwhole north-west corner of the Buenos Aires province, from the Salado,\r\nin the district of Junin, to the southern limit of the Nueve de Julio\r\nand Pehuajo departments, and as far as the latitude of Guamini. The\r\nlimit of the lucerne farms does not include the lands of the central\r\nPampa, but advances westward and takes in part of the Pedernera\r\ndepartment in the San Luis province. The lucerne farms run along the\r\nSan Rafael line to Batavia, and at this point they reach the limits of\r\nthe colonized zone. In addition, the zone of the lucerne farms includes\r\nthe whole south-eastern part of the Córdoba province, as high up as the\r\nline from Villa Mercedes to Villa Maria, and the southern part of the\r\nSanta Fé province. In the whole of this area, fifteen to twenty-five\r\nper cent. of the surface is planted with lucerne. The conditions\r\nrequired for its cultivation are a moderate depth of the underground\r\nwater and a light soil that allows the roots to penetrate easily. The\r\neastern belt of clays is not good for lucerne, which survives there for\r\nmuch less time than in the west, where it may live fifteen or twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe lucerne belt is above all a great breeding area for horned cattle,\r\nas sheep-pasturage injures the lucerne. It is not nearly so monotonous,\r\nhowever, as the preceding regions. In the south-east, in the Buenos\r\nAires province, the creation of the lucerne farms was undertaken at a\r\ntime when agricultural colonization had already begun. We therefore\r\nfind two types of exploitation side by side. The cultivation of maize\r\nenters it in the south-west, in spite of the comparatively unfavourable\r\nclimatic conditions. The centre of the lucerne area in the south of\r\nthe Córdoba province is also a great agricultural zone; but there\r\nagriculture is directly connected with the creation of the lucerne\r\nestates. It is, in fact, entrusted to colonists who till the ground\r\nfor four or five years, and restore it to the owners sown with lucerne\r\nat the expiration of their lease. The crops consist almost exclusively\r\nof wheat and flax. Lastly, in the west (San Luis province and extreme\r\nsouth-west of Córdoba province) the soil gets increasingly more sandy,\r\nand the climate drier. A single tillage suffices to destroy the natural\r\nvegetation and clear the place for lucerne. The lucerne fields have\r\nbeen created by the breeders themselves, the sole masters of the\r\nregion, without the aid of the colonists.\r\n\r\n4. Beyond the lucerne belt, at the point where the plain rises toward\r\nthe Sierra de San Luis and the Sierra de Córdoba, the subterranean\r\nwater sinks deeper. This zone at the foot of the ranges, unsuitable\r\nfor lucerne, yet with a soil comparatively rich in humus, has been\r\ntaken up by agricultural workers. The wheat area extends, in the San\r\nLuis province, as far as Fraga and Naschel, in the Conlara depression.\r\nThe maize area extends to Oncativo, in the Córdoba province, between\r\nthe Tercero and Secundo rivers, where the summer rainfall is heavier.\r\nThanks to the nearness of the mountains, this area has a water-supply\r\nfor irrigation, and this sustains several small centres of good farms.\r\n\r\n5. The south of the Buenos Aires province and the central Pampa are the\r\nwheat zone. The bed of _tosca_, which is not far below the soil, does\r\nno harm to the wheat except in years of drought. The valleys, where\r\nthe _tosca_ is interrupted, and the dunes, where the soil is deep, are\r\nvery carefully used for lucerne fields of limited extent. Wheat-growing\r\nseems now, both in this and the preceding zone, to have reached its\r\nlimit, as the dryness makes it improbable that there will be any\r\nextension westward.\r\n\r\n6. Lastly, the east of the Buenos Aires province, the centre of\r\nwhich is fairly indicated by the little town of Dolores, is the only\r\npart of the Pampean plain which has not been reached by agricultural\r\ncolonization. The land lies low, and is badly drained. The only change\r\nthat has taken place in the vegetation is a progressive improvement due\r\nto the hoofs of the cattle during their long stays there. This pastoral\r\narea is clearly limited in the south by the Sierra de Tandil. In the\r\nnorth it is continued in the more varied region that lies between\r\nBuenos Aires and the lower Salado, where the alternation of winter\r\npasture on the dry lands and summer pasture in the valleys, encourages\r\nthe best methods of breeding, and has made it the region of the dairy\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nIn the Entre Rios province the limit of the large estates of wheat and\r\nflax is marked by 32° S. lat. The part of Entre Rios which extends\r\nnorth of 32° and the Corrientes province do not strictly belong to the\r\nPampean region.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nExtensive breeding was the first form taken by white colonization on\r\nthe Pampa. The word breeding is, in fact, hardly the correct name for\r\nan industry that mainly consisted of hunting, and was wholly distinct\r\nfrom the patient and advanced methods used at the same time in the\r\nnorthern provinces.\r\n\r\n\"The real wealth of the province of Buenos Aires,\" says Dean Funes,\r\n\"was, and always will be, the trade in hides\" (_la pellejería_).[87]\r\nA good part of the hides exported came from the hunting of the wild\r\ncattle and horses which had grown numerous on the area of the Pampa\r\nbeyond the Rio Salado.[88] It was mainly after 1778, when trade with\r\nSpain had been authorized and there was an increased demand for hides,\r\nthat the hunting of these ownerless beasts was taken up. Two thousand\r\nSpaniards from Buenos Aires, Santa Fé and Mendoza hunted every day,\r\nsays D'Azara, killing an animal for each of their meals in addition\r\nto those they killed for hides. From 1775 to the Revolution, the\r\nSpanish Government made continuous efforts to regulate and reduce the\r\nmassacre of the herds. It laid down penalties for every person selling\r\nhides that did not bear his own mark; it farmed out the right to hunt\r\nanimals with no mark, and organized the destruction of wild dogs, etc.\r\nThe ranches developed under shelter of this legislation. Still, the\r\nRevolution did not witness the end of this cattle-hunting. D'Orbigny\r\ntook part in 1828 in two hunts of wild horses (_baguales_) in Entre\r\nRios. The Argentine _gaucho_ long retained the ways of a hunter rather\r\nthan those of a breeder in the strict sense; witness Urquiza's soldiers\r\nwho, says Demersay, during the campaign of 1846, when they could not\r\nfind trees to which they could fasten their horses, killed cattle and\r\ntied the reins to their horns.\r\n\r\n     [87] _Ensayo de la historia civil del Paraguay, Buenos Aires,\r\n     y Tucumán_ (3 vols, in 16^{mo}) Buenos Aires, 1816, t. iii, p.\r\n     214.\r\n\r\n     [88] The number of wild animals and the area over which they\r\n     roamed have often been exaggerated. It does not look as if\r\n     they ever covered the whole of the Pampean plain. A salter who\r\n     crossed Patagonia and the whole of the Pampa in 1753 (_Voyage\r\n     du San Martin au fort de San Julian_, Coll. de Angelis, v.)\r\n     only found wild herds near the Salado frontier, and he knew by\r\n     this that he was close to the ranches. At the beginning of the\r\n     nineteenth century there were no wild cattle left on the right\r\n     bank of the Paraná. There were still some in Entre Rios.\r\n\r\nPassing from the hunting country to the zone of ranches, one notices\r\nthat the main work of the breeder is to prevent his cattle from running\r\nwild. \"The ranches of this country,\" said Dean Funes, \"having been set\r\nup on immense plains, on which it was not easy to confine the herds\r\nwithin fixed limits, it sometimes happened that the animals went vast\r\ndistances in search of water or pasture, and ended by being regarded\r\nas wild and ownerless,\" When D'Azara wants to show that the ranches\r\nof Paraguay are superior to those of Buenos Aires, he is content to\r\nsay that there the animals are tamer (_mansos_). With the wild animal\r\n(_alzado_) is contrasted the _de rodeo_ animal: that is to say, the\r\ncattle which are rounded up periodically in the centre of the ranch to\r\nbe taken to the pasture where they must live (_aquerenciar_). It is the\r\ndifficulty of preventing the dispersal of the herd that fixes the price\r\nof the _rincones_ (surrounded by inundated areas) of Corrientes, in\r\nwhich the animals are captives.\r\n\r\nMacKann's description of pastoral life in the Buenos Aires province in\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century give us a very clear impression\r\nof the stage of transition between exploiting the natural increase of\r\na herd that multiplies without man's intervention, and breeding in\r\nthe strict sense. The value of a horse in the former case is almost\r\nexclusively the cost of breaking it in. The breeder is actually anxious\r\nwhen he sees his horses increase, as he fears he may not have the\r\nresources for breaking them in. The most formidable of the dangers that\r\nthreatened the feeble discipline of the herd was drought. That in the\r\nyear 1827 was a disaster. The animals left the ranches in a body to go\r\nsouthward, where they mixed.[89]\r\n\r\n     [89] The water problem is not as important for the history of\r\n     colonization in the Pampean region as in the north. Primitive\r\n     breeding was confined to natural supplies of water, lagoons\r\n     or streams, and to shallow wells (_jagueles_) dug down to\r\n     the superficial sheet, which is generally not deep, but is\r\n     liable to dry up. As colonization improved, the breeder, and\r\n     subsequently the farmer, were better equipped for boring\r\n     wells, and no longer feared drought. They got down to the\r\n     deeper waters, semi-artesian (Buenos Aires district) or\r\n     artesian (west of the Santa Fé province, round San Francisco).\r\n     In other places the superficial waters, which are fresher\r\n     than the deeper layers, were used by adapting new types of\r\n     filters to the wells (Buena Esperanza district). The only two\r\n     districts where the quest of water offered any difficulty are\r\n     the south-west corner of the Pampean region and the northern\r\n     extremity of the prairie in the Santa Fé province. The sheets\r\n     of water are very irregular there, often saline, and it was a\r\n     long time before the ranches got an assured supply.\r\n\r\n     One remarkable circumstance is the importance of the dunes in\r\n     connection with the distribution of the underground water. The\r\n     rain-water accumulates in the dunes and flows slowly through\r\n     the sand to the sub-soil. The level of the underground sheet\r\n     in the clay on which the dune rests is always nearer the\r\n     surface in the neighbourhood of the dune. The dune itself has\r\n     often a greener vegetation than the land around it. Nothing\r\n     is more surprising than to find at Medanos (west of Bahía\r\n     Blanca), in the middle of a plain of arid aspect, fields of\r\n     lucerne and orchards lodged in the hollows of dunes that are\r\n     still fresh. In the whole of the Buenos Aires province the\r\n     dead district of the dunes is, on account of its water-supply,\r\n     a good place for habitation. D'Azara notices the numerous\r\n     water-spots which ran along the foot of the dead dunes of the\r\n     Cerillada. All round were the white bones of the _baguales_.\r\n     In the valleys of the central Pampa, where the sheet of water\r\n     in the centre of the valley is often saline, the underground\r\n     water improves gradually as one approaches the line of the\r\n     dunes.\r\n\r\nRevolutions and wars interrupted the work of taming the cattle. When\r\nGalvez went from the Córdoba province to Buenos Aires at the end of the\r\nRosas Government, he was struck by the condition of the ranches.[90]\r\nMany of them had been confiscated, or their owners driven into exile.\r\nCattle were no longer marked, and they had become wild. The troubles\r\nof the emancipation-period were much less injurious to the Buenos\r\nAires breeders than to those of Entre Rios. The Entre Rios herd was\r\nalmost annihilated during the revolution, and some of the ranchers of\r\nthe left bank crossed to the right bank of the Paraná. After 1823 the\r\npastoral wealth of Entre Rios was rapidly restored, thanks to raids on\r\nBrazilian territory. They were so profitable that the whole population\r\ntook part in them. In 1827 the inhabitants of Bajada went there in such\r\nnumbers that the town was half deserted. Every day thousands of cattle\r\nwere collected on the bank of the Uruguay, and crossed the river. Some\r\nof them were even taken beyond the Paraná, to the Santa Fé province.\r\nWoodbine Parish confirms this rapid restoration of Entre Rios, of\r\nwhich D'Orbigny was a witness. But this period of prosperity did not\r\nlast long. The war with Uruguay, under Rosas, again ruined the Entre\r\nRios ranches, and the drought of 1846 helped to scatter the remaining\r\nherds. Extensive breeding is only lightly rooted in the soil. The\r\nchief centres of production change their locality, as the political\r\ncircumstances change, from one part of the Pampean plain to another.\r\n\r\n     [90] V.

To face p. 182.]\r\n\r\nPrimitive breeding affords few examples of periodical migration for the\r\nbetter use of pasturage. In 1822, in the course of a journey amongst\r\nthe Sierras de Tandil and de la Ventana, Colonel Garcia noticed that\r\nthe Indians kept their cattle round the temporary lagoons of the\r\nplain in the winter, and went up to the mountain-streams in summer.\r\nTranshumation movements of this kind were difficult for the creole\r\nranchers, whose fairly large herds could not be handled easily. The\r\nChascomus breeders, however, at the close of the eighteenth century,\r\ndrove their cattle to the low banks of the Salado during the dry\r\nseason.[91] Garcia also notices the importance of the Salado pastures\r\nfor the ranches of Salto, Areco, and Lujan.[92] The need to remove the\r\nherds in the dry season, and to find _invernadas_ within reach of the\r\nformer ranches, was due to the change brought about in the natural\r\nvegetation of the Pampa and the spread of the _pasto dulce_. The\r\nannual herbs which compose the _pasto dulce_ die and disappear after\r\nfertilization. Until the autumn rain they leave the ground quite naked,\r\nwhereas the tough grasses of the _pasto duro_ afforded a thin but\r\npermanent pasture.\r\n\r\n     [91] _Diario de un reconocimiento de las guardias y fortines\r\n     que garnecen la linea de frontera de Buenos Aires_ (1796), by\r\n     D. Felix de Azara (Coll. de Angelis, vi.).\r\n\r\n     [92] _Nueva plan de fronteras de la Provincia de Buenos Aires\r\n     por el Colonel Garcia_ (1816, Coll. de Angelis, vi.).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first improvements of the pastoral industry of the Pampa are\r\nconnected with the development of sheep-breeding. Exports of wool\r\nbegan about 1840, and made great progress after 1855 (17,000 tons\r\nin 1860, 65,000 tons in 1870). From 1850 to about 1890 the economic\r\nreturns on sheep-breeding were far better than on cattle-breeding.\r\nDuring the whole of this period the multiplication of sheep farms was\r\nonly restricted by the supply of workers. The first shepherds had been\r\nBasques, in the south of the Buenos Aires province, and Irish, in the\r\nnorth. The owner settled them as small farmers in the _puestos_ on the\r\nedge of the ranch, the central part of which was devoted to cattle.\r\nThey could thus, while they guarded their sheep, see that the limits of\r\nthe estate were respected, and prevent the cattle from roaming.\r\n\r\nWool was for a long time the only product of the sheep-rearing\r\nindustry. From 1866 onward it was decided to use the hides and tallow\r\nalso. As the material of the grease-works was cheap, they spread all\r\nover the sheep zone. Many ranches had works of their own. From 1867\r\nto 1877 the _saladeros_ that had been built long before for killing\r\ncattle undertook the slaughter of sheep on a large scale. The number\r\nof sheep sold to the _saladeros_ rose to 3,000,000 a year. In 1880 the\r\nfirst cargoes of frozen mutton were sent abroad. The creation of the\r\ngrease-works had made no difference to the breeding, but the building\r\nof the refrigerators brought about a rapid transformation of the flock.\r\nThe Lincoln breed, heavier and more meaty, displaced the fine-wool\r\nMerinos. This substitution of Lincolns for Merinos is now complete\r\nthroughout the Pampean region.\r\n\r\nUntil 1880 sheep-rearing was concentrated east of the Salado, north\r\nand south of Buenos Aires, beginning with a line that passes through\r\nQuilmes, San Vicente, Pilar, and Campana, which marks the limit of the\r\nsuburban zone. In addition it had spread on the right bank of the lower\r\nSalado as far as the foot of the Sierra de Tandil, in an area where the\r\nfirst stations date from 1823, though the population did not make much\r\nprogress until after 1855. About 1880, after the pacification of the\r\nPampa, the sheep-farms began to expand westward. It was then that the\r\nwool of the _pasto fuerte_ appeared on the Buenos Aires market. It came\r\nfrom the Azal district in 1870, from Olavarria in 1880, from Bolivar in\r\n1885, and from Villegas in 1890. The Census of 1889 ascribes 51,000,000\r\nsheep to the province of Buenos Aires; that of 1895 gives much the same\r\nfigure (52,000,000). Detailed comparison of the two enumerations shows\r\nthat the expansive movement to the west continued, and was completed\r\nduring this period. The flocks in the north-west zone of the province\r\n(Lincoln, Villegas, Trenque, Lauquen) more than doubled; the flocks of\r\nthe south-west area (Alsina, Puan, Bahía Blanca, Villarino) continued\r\nto grow, and increased by a third. Those on the lands of the central\r\nPampa increased threefold. On the other hand, in the departments\r\nnorth and south of the Sierra de Tandil, where colonization is older,\r\nsheep-breeding is stationary. The north-east and south-east areas,\r\nbetween the Paraná and the Salado, have diminished: one losing a fifth,\r\nand the other a half, of its flocks.\r\n\r\nFrom 1895 onward the number of flocks of sheep on the Pampean plain\r\ndecreased rapidly. The number of sheep had sunk from 34,000,000 in 1908\r\nto 18,000,000 in 1915 for the Buenos Aires province; from 2,800,000\r\nin 1908 to 2,300,000 in 1914 for the central Pampa. The reduction was\r\ngeneral, and found in every district; but it was not equally great\r\neverywhere, and did not begin at the same date in every district.\r\nSheep-breeding has almost entirely disappeared from the eastern belt,\r\neast of the Salado, which was its cradle. South of Buenos Aires\r\nthe sheep are giving place to horned cattle, and they had almost\r\ndisappeared by 1908. North of Buenos Aires they survived long, but\r\nthe reduction of the flocks has only been the more rapid since 1908.\r\nThis corresponds with the advance of maize-growing. In six years the\r\nBartolome Mitre and Pergamino departments have lost, respectively,\r\nfour-fifths and five-sixths of their sheep. In the north-west of the\r\nBuenos Aires province the sheep began to be reduced at the time when\r\nthe lucerne farms were founded, about 1900. The decrease has since\r\ngone on uninterruptedly. The actual flocks represent one-fourth of\r\nthe flocks of 1895. In the south-west (wheat belt) there was a rapid\r\nshrinkage before 1908, but it seems to have almost been arrested since\r\nthen, thanks to the combining of sheep-rearing with wheat and oats. The\r\nactual flocks are about one-half the flocks of 1895. Finally, in the\r\narea north of the Sierra de Tandil the sheep retreat before the cattle,\r\nas they do further north, but they are not so completely wiped out as\r\nin the lucerne belt, and the flocks are still two fifths of the flocks\r\nof twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Entre Rios and south of Corrientes the number of\r\nsheep continued to rise until 1908, but the increase is only in the\r\nnorthern departments, outside the agricultural belt. The southern\r\ndepartments, which are large growers of wheat and flax, lost one-third\r\nof their flocks between 1895 and 1908.\r\n\r\nCattle-breeding was restricted for a long time by the difficulty of\r\ndisposing of its products. The hides alone found ready buyers. The\r\nmaking and export of salt beef dates from the eighteenth century, and\r\nit was to help this industry that the expeditions to the salt-beds of\r\nthe Pampa and the journeys of salters to the Patagonian coast were\r\norganized. From 1792 to 1796 no less than 39,000 quintals of jerked\r\nbeef were sent from the Rio de la Plata to Havana. But the market for\r\nsalt meat (_tasajo_) was always limited. It consisted only of the\r\nAntilles and Brazil, and the _saladeros_ never fully exploited the\r\nmeat-producing capacity of the Argentine herds. The crisis of the\r\n_saladeros_ occurred before the time when the refrigerators began to\r\ncompete with them. By 1889 there were only three left in the province\r\nof Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\nAlthough the price of cattle was not very remunerative, and provided\r\nno incentive to improve the breeding; although the _saladero_ was not\r\nat all exorbitant, merely asking for animals in good condition, the\r\nimprovement of the herd by introducing selected pedigree-breeders had\r\nbegun about the middle of the nineteenth century. The Basque dairies\r\nestablished in the district near Buenos Aires sold pedigree-calves\r\nto the ranches, and these were used for breeding purposes.[93] About\r\n1880 the advance of sheep-breeding pressed the cattle-ranches back and\r\ndisputed the space with them more and more, within the ancient Indian\r\nfrontier. The smallness of the market for cattle and their slight\r\nmercantile value were very favourable circumstances for the occupation\r\nof the new lands, thrown open at this date by the submission of the\r\nIndians. The herds which found no buyers were sent to the _campos\r\nde afuera_. The ranches developed very rapidly. Daireaux has very\r\naccurately described this period of pastoral colonization, and the\r\nstarting of convoys that were intended to give a population to the west\r\nof the Pampa. Cattle were there several years before sheep. As a matter\r\nof fact, breeders do not regard cattle as having a value of their own.\r\nThey are merely auxiliaries that must improve the pasture and prepare\r\nthe ground for sheep. The cattle themselves are preceded by troops of\r\nhalf-wild horses which first take possession of the virgin field and\r\nbegin the transformation of it.\r\n\r\n     [93] This is, in a special form, the first instance of\r\n     specialization, in the cantons of the Pampean region, in the\r\n     breeding industry, properly so called (producing breeders).\r\n\r\nThe number of cattle increases rapidly. In 1875 it was estimated that\r\nthere were 5,000,000 head of cattle in the province of Buenos Aires.\r\nIn 1889 there were 8,500,000. Since that date the variations have\r\nbeen comparatively slight. The Census of 1895 gives 7,700,000; that\r\nof 1908 gives 10,300,000; that of 1914 gives 9,000,000; and that of\r\n1915 gives 11,300,000.[94] But the value of the cattle has gone up\r\nrapidly. The exports of live meat, which lasted from 1889 to 1900, were\r\nthe beginning of the rise. It was strengthened when the refrigerators\r\nceased to confine themselves to killing sheep and began to buy cattle.\r\nThe exports of chilled or frozen beef increased after 1898. The value\r\nof them rose to 10,000,000 gold piastres in 1904, double that in 1909,\r\nand more than quadruple in 1914.\r\n\r\n     [94] The variations in number are less considerable for the\r\n     Pampean region than for the whole of Argentina. It is better\r\n     supplied with capital than the other breeding districts, and\r\n     can rapidly replace the losses caused by excessive export by\r\n     buying cattle in the adjoining provinces.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the price paid by the refrigerators for\r\npedigree-cattle and the price of animals of creole blood, which the\r\nlocal market takes, hurries up the transformation of the herd. In\r\norder to watch reproduction and nurse the pasture, the ranches put up\r\nwire-fences. But the breeding methods are especially modified by the\r\nintroduction of lucerne. It spread in the south of Córdoba and west of\r\nthe Buenos Aires province from 1895 onward, and from 1905 onward in\r\npart of the San Luis province. There were already small lucerne farms\r\nin the Buenos Aires province. A description that was written at the\r\nend of the eighteenth century speaks of lucerne farms round the town\r\nwhich were reserved for feeding draught cattle.[95] But the area from\r\nwhich the cultivation of lucerne started at the close of the nineteenth\r\ncentury is the district of the Córdoba province that is crossed by the\r\nline from Rosario to Córdoba, completed about 1870 to Bellville and\r\nVilla Marina. The lucerne farms there were not created by the breeders,\r\nand the lucerne was at first intended for export to Rosario and Buenos\r\nAires in the form of dry fodder. The trade in dry fodder has remained\r\ngood there. The 1908 Census gives 128 square kilometres of lucerne for\r\ncutting in the Tercero Abajo department (Villa Maria) and 267 square\r\nkilometres in the Union department (Bellville).[96]\r\n\r\n     [95] Fernando Barrero, _Descripción de las provincias del Rio\r\n     de la Plata_ (published by the Argentine Ministry of Foreign\r\n     Affairs, Buenos Aires, 1911).\r\n\r\n     [96] Amongst the specialized industries connected with the\r\n     development of the lucerne farms we must mention the growing\r\n     of lucerne for seed, which has settled in the dry zones, where\r\n     the lucerne is not so much invaded by other species; for\r\n     instance, the district of Madanos, west of Bahía Blanca.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAP III.--THE CATTLE-BREEDING AREAS.\r\n  _The density of the herd is slight in the maize belt. It is\r\n  considerable in the centre and east of the Pampean region, which supply\r\n  the refrigerators with pedigree stock of good weight. The density is\r\n  considerable also in the north of Mesopotamia, but the cattle there\r\n  are less valuable and are taken by the saladeros of the Uruguay. The\r\n  presence of the tick, which inoculates cattle with Texas fever, is\r\n  the chief obstacle to the improvement of the herd in the north of\r\n  Argentina._                                             To face p. 188.]\r\n\r\nThe lucerne spread southward and south-westward from this point; and\r\nthe improvement of the herds kept pace with it. I have shown elsewhere\r\nhow this improvement was checked north of a line along the course of\r\nthe Paraná, the northern frontier of the Constitución and General Lopez\r\ndepartments, in the province of Santa Fé and on the Rio Cuarto, and\r\nin the Córdoba province, by the presence of the _garrapate_, which\r\ninoculates the cattle with a dreaded disease, Texas fever. The creole\r\ncattle are immunized against the _garrapate_, but pedigree cattle\r\nquickly succumb to it. In order to protect the southern zone, where\r\nthe _garrapate_ does not reproduce, the Argentine Government imposes\r\nsevere restrictions on the transport of cattle from north to south;\r\nthe cattle have to have disinfectant baths at the frontier-stations.\r\nThis cuts pastoral Argentina in two. While the Durham cattle of the\r\nsouth are intended for the refrigerators, the creole cattle of the\r\nnorth still supply the _saladeros_, which have disappeared from Buenos\r\nAires, but survive on the Uruguay. Yet the advantages of crossing with\r\nEuropean breeds are such that the northern breeders, in spite of the\r\nrisk and the expense, have not given up all hope of accomplishing it.\r\nThe transformation of the herd, however, is bound to be very slow.\r\nPedigree breeders are brought from the south and kept in the stable.\r\nTheir progeny, born on the spot, resist Texas fever better and can be\r\nput out to pasture. There has been more progress in the contaminated\r\nzone on the right bank of the Paraná than in Entre Rios and Corrientes.\r\nPedigree animals have been introduced at Santa Fé, not only in the\r\nregion of the colonies, but further north, in the extreme northern\r\ncorner of the Pampa (San Cristobal department), colonized by ranchers\r\nfrom the north of Buenos Aires and the south of Santa Fé, who were\r\nousted by the progress of maize. They have brought with them to the\r\nnew lands the cultivation of lucerne and the methods they followed on\r\ntheir former property. At Corrientes, on the other hand, breeding is an\r\nhistoric industry. The staff of the ranches is indigenous. The pastoral\r\ntraditions are unchanged.\r\n\r\nWhen we study the variations in the numbers of cattle in different\r\nparts of the Pampa, by comparing the results of recent Censuses\r\nwe find that the number has risen rapidly since 1895 in the whole\r\nof the eastern area, north of the Sierra de Tandil. The increase\r\nis particularly conspicuous north of the Rio Salado, in the dairy\r\ndistrict. (Mean density in 1915, 40 to 60 horned cattle per square\r\nkilometre.) In the south-west region (wheat belt) the density has\r\nalways been low (12 per square kilometre), and it shows no tendency\r\nto increase. In the north and western region of Buenos Aires (lucerne\r\nbelt) there has been a rapid increase, especially between 1895 and 1908\r\n(creation of the lucerne farms), and it has not been interrupted since\r\n(density 50 to the square kilometre). There is the same increase in\r\nthe whole area of the lucerne farms in the Córdoba, Santa Fé, and San\r\nLuis provinces, where the herds doubled between 1895 and 1908. Only two\r\nregions have suffered a reduction: the agricultural area of the centre\r\n(Chacabuco, Chivilcoy), where there has been a decrease since 1895, and\r\nthe maize district (north of Buenos Aires), where cattle-rearing did\r\nnot diminish until after 1908.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgriculture had begun to develop by the end of the eighteenth century\r\nin the district round Buenos Aires. D'Azara admits the enormous\r\npreponderance of breeding, but mentions that the right bank of the\r\nParaná exported flour to the left bank, which was exclusively pastoral.\r\nBarrero also observes that between the belt of orchards and lucerne\r\nfields, about a league in width, which surrounded Buenos Aires, and\r\nthe area of the ranches, which did not begin for six or eight leagues,\r\nthere was an agricultural belt, the district of the _chacras de pan\r\nllevar_. The main crop was wheat, and the tillage was chiefly done in\r\nthe rich soils at the bottom of the valleys, which are called _cañadas_\r\nin the local dialect (cañada de Moron, cañada du Rio Lujan, etc.).\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not at Buenos Aires, but in the Santa Fé province,\r\nthat modern agricultural colonization began in the nineteenth century.\r\nIt goes back to the foundation (in 1854) of the colony of Esperanza,\r\nwest of Santa Fé, from which it was separated by the strip of forest\r\nwhich follows the course of the Salado. European immigrants--Swiss,\r\nFrench, and Piedmontese--had settled there. The early years of\r\ncolonization at Santa Fé were difficult, and the colonies did not begin\r\nto develop rapidly until after 1870. About that date we can distinguish\r\nthree nuclei of agricultural colonization at Santa Fé. The first group\r\nof colonies was settled in the north, on the bank of the Paraná. In the\r\ncentre the Esperanza group advanced steadily westward. A third group\r\nof colonies lay along the Central Argentine railway from Rosario to\r\nCórdoba.\r\n\r\nThe Esperanza colonists had at first grown maize, but the prosperity\r\nof the colonies was mainly due to wheat. Zeballos, who visited the\r\ncolonies in 1882, describes them as a vast lake of wheat. Wheat\r\npredominates, not only in the department of Las Colonias, west of Santa\r\nFé, where it survives in full strength, but further north, at Garay,\r\nwhence it has since been displaced by flax and earth-nuts, and in the\r\nsouth, round Rosario, in the belt which is now given up to maize. It is\r\nfor the wheat that the mills of Carcaraña and the granaries of Rosario\r\nhave been built. The land sown with wheat at Santa Fé rose in 1882\r\nto 102,000 hectares out of a total of 127,000 hectares of cultivated\r\nland.[97] By 1889 the area of wheat was quadrupled. It spread like a\r\ndrop of oil, reaching Rafäela and Castellanos on the west. In 1895 the\r\nadvance was still more rapid. Wheat-growing has crossed the Córdoba\r\nfrontier, and spread round San Francisco and east of Mar Chiquita\r\n(departments of San Justo and Marcos Juarez). The agricultural regions\r\nin the centre of the Santa Fé province and those of the Central\r\nArgentine have met, and the wheat has invaded the whole of the San\r\nMartin department. It extends even south of the old colonies of the\r\nCentral Argentine toward the south-west of Santa Fé, in the General\r\nLopez department.\r\n\r\n     [97] The population of the Santa Fé colonies in 1882 was\r\n     52,000, of whom 12,000 were in the colonies of the San Javier,\r\n     north of the town of Santa Fé.\r\n\r\nThe 1908 Census shows a very different state of things. The density of\r\nthe wheat-cultivation has continued to grow appreciably in the whole\r\nof the northern region, and also in the south-west of the province,\r\nat some distance from the Paraná (General Lopez department). On the\r\nother hand, it has been reduced in the adjoining district of Rosario\r\n(departments of Iriondo, Belgrana, Caseros, and Constitución), where\r\nmaize-growing has developed. Maize has won part of the wheat belt.\r\n\r\n  ----------------+----------------------+---------------------\r\n                  |       Wheat Area     |    Maize Area\r\n                  |    (in kilometres).  |  (in kilometers).\r\n  Departments.[98]|------+-------+-------+------+------+-------\r\n                  | 1889 |  1895 |  1908 | 1889 | 1895 | 1908\r\n  ----------------+------+-------+-------+------+------+-------\r\n  Las Colonias   }|1,623{| 1,307 | 1,621 |}  82 |{  24 |    31\r\n  Castillanos    }|     {| 1,845 | 3,425 |}     |{   4 |     7\r\n  S.

The department of\r\n     San Jeronimo straddles the maize region and the region of the\r\n     colonies. The General Lopez territory also extends, in the\r\n     south-west, far beyond the limit of the maize belt.\r\n\r\nThis originality is not so much in virtue of its crops (hard wheat and\r\nflax) as on account of the age of colonization and the division of\r\nproperty. Most of the colonists are owners, and estates of 50 to 200\r\nhectares are the rule. The houses are comfortable; they are surrounded\r\nby orchards and kitchen-gardens. Moreover, the rural economy has been\r\ncomplicated, and it has assumed a familiar aspect for the European\r\nobserver, owing to the introduction of cattle-rearing on a small\r\nscale by the farmers. The number of horned cattle doubled between\r\n1908 and 1914 in the Castellanos department, and increased by a third\r\nin Las Colonias. The area of lucerne has extended in proportion. The\r\nfarms have been multiplied on the low lands (_cañadas_), unsuitable\r\nfor wheat, which the older colonists had disdained; but they are\r\nnow regarded as the best bits of land. The recent rise in the value\r\nof land in the region of the colonies is connected, not with an\r\nincrease of agricultural production, but a development of breeding. A\r\nfew co-operative dairy societies have been established. In general,\r\nhowever, breeding is solely for the meat-market. The cattle-trade goes\r\non very different lines from those of the large estates and ranches. It\r\nhas remained in the hands of small dealers (Jews of Moïsesville).\r\n\r\nAgricultural colonization in the Buenos Aires province was at first\r\nentirely independent of the Santa Fé colonization. The crops of the\r\nadjoining region of Buenos Aires never disappeared altogether. In the\r\nperiod to which Daireaux's description of the economic life of the\r\nPampa refers (1880-89), the farmers disputed with the breeders a belt\r\nsome ten leagues broad round the capital. But sheep-breeding left no\r\nplace for agriculture in the next belt, which enclosed the first on\r\nevery side, and extended almost as far as the Salado. Agricultural\r\ncolonization had found free land only beyond the sheep-farm area, 170\r\nmiles west of Buenos Aires, round Chivilcoy, Chacabuco, and Bragado.\r\nAs early as 1872 the Chivilcoy district produced 130,000 hectolitres\r\nof wheat; or nearly half the total production of the Buenos Aires\r\nprovince. In 1889 it formed a comparatively dense agricultural patch,\r\nthe cultivated area being devoted half to wheat and half to maize.\r\n\r\n               Wheat.      Maize.\r\n\r\n  Chivilcoy    307 kms.    399 kms.\r\n\r\n  Chacabuco    155  \"      164  \"\r\n\r\n  Bragado      147  \"      261  \"\r\n\r\nAt that date the whole west and south of the Buenos Aires province\r\nwas exclusively pastoral. There were only two isolated nuclei of\r\nagricultural colonization. The first was round Olavarria, on the old\r\nIndian frontier, where Russo-German colonies had been established in\r\n1878. The second was in the Suarez department, at the extreme north of\r\nthe Sierra de la Ventana, where a group of French colonists settled\r\nfive years later, at Pigüe.[99] The opening of the line from Buenos\r\nAires to Bahía Blanca ought, one would think, to have prepared the\r\nway for agricultural colonization in this section. However, the 1895\r\nCensus shows a check to these first attempts at tillage in the south.\r\nIt fell by one half at Suarez, and by three-fourths at Olavarria. The\r\nPigüe colonists have succeeded in keeping to their lands, but those of\r\nOlavarria have abandoned them, and most of them have emigrated to the\r\nEntre Rios province.\r\n\r\n     [99] Wheat-area in 1889 in the Olavarria department, 319\r\n     square kilometres; in the Suarez department, 118 square\r\n     kilometres.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE PAMPEAN PLAIN.

This is one of the regions of\r\nthe Pampa where the most different types of rural exploitation are\r\nmingled together. Agricultural colonization has been carried on both by\r\nsmall proprietors and farmers or tenants. Wheat and maize seem to be\r\npermanently associated, and the climate is equally good for both; the\r\nmaize crop being the better if the summer is wet, and the wheat crop\r\nwhen the summer is dry. The two cereals follow each other on the same\r\nland, in rotation, the wheat being helped by the constant weeding and\r\nclearing which the maize requires. The colonists use oxen in the work,\r\nand fatten them afterwards.[100]\r\n\r\n     [100] Draught animals in 1908: at Chivilcoy, 17,000 cattle\r\n     and 10,000 horses; at Junin, 15,000 cattle and 6,000 horses;\r\n     at Nueve de Julio, 15,000 cattle and 6,000 horses.

The extreme west of the lucerne belt (Pedernera\r\ndepartment and San Luis) is the only place where the cultivated area\r\nwas reduced. The contracts by which the ranchers entrust their lands to\r\nthe colonists, on condition of returning them sown with lucerne, were\r\ngradually modified as the stream of colonization developed. The land\r\nwas at first left to the colonist rent free, the rancher being paid by\r\nthe creation of the lucerne fields. But in proportion to the increasing\r\nvolume of the stream of immigrants, and the keener competition of the\r\ncolonists, the rancher asked better terms. There are similar contracts\r\nin regard to the restoration of lucerne fields which have been worn\r\nout by pasturage, so that the land has to be ploughed up periodically.\r\nThe men who clear the land in the lucerne belt have mostly been\r\nrecruited in the district of the old colonies of Santa Fé, where the\r\nnew generation had begun to feel the pinch. The crops which they raise\r\nduring the four or five years of their lease are chosen without any\r\nidea of sparing lands which they are not to keep. Wheat succeeds wheat,\r\nand the first and last crop is often flax. The proportion of flax is\r\nlower only in the southern part of the lucerne belt. In the Buenos\r\nAires province the colonist grows lucerne on his own account, either to\r\nsell as dry fodder or for breeding or fattening.\r\n\r\nColonization does not in these parts correspond with the division of\r\nproperty. Not only does the farmer not become the owner of the soil,\r\nbut he does not live on it permanently; he is a veritable nomad. His\r\nhouse has a temporary look that strikes one at the first glance. The\r\narea cultivated is almost stable, if the region is considered as a\r\nwhole. But cultivation passes periodically from one section to another,\r\nand its removals cause sudden alterations or crises in the railway\r\ntraffic and the development of the urban centres.\r\n\r\nThe lucerne belt has been peopled by Santafecinos, and it has in\r\nturn sent colonists to the western agricultural belt at the foot\r\nof the Sierras de San Luis and de Córdoba. They have less suitable\r\nclimatological conditions, but they have the advantage of greater\r\nstability, as the breeders do not dispute the land with them.\r\n\r\nWhile agricultural colonization has been an aid to pastoral\r\ncolonization in the north-west of Buenos Aires, it tends to displace\r\nbreeding, or restrict its sphere, in the north-east and the south.\r\nMaize-growing started on the banks of the Paraná, where it was already\r\nparamount in 1889, between Campana (north of Buenos Aires) and San\r\nNicolas. In 1895 it advanced up the Paraná as far as the Santa Fé\r\nprovince (Constitución) and spread over the interior for some sixty\r\nmiles in the Salto department. In the next few years it made rapid\r\nprogress toward the west and north-west, covering the departments of\r\nPergamino, Rojas, and Colon, and part of General Lopez, San Lorenzo,\r\nand Constitución in the province of Santa Fé.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-----------------+------------------\r\n                 |   Maize Area.   |    Flax Area.\r\n                 |-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n                 | 1889| 1895| 1908| 1889| 1895| 1908\r\n  ---------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n  Campana        |  67 |  45 |   22|  15 |  31 |  17\r\n  Baradero       | 339 | 260 |  291|  26 |  78 | 173\r\n  S.

Flax-growing\r\nwas not added to maize until 1900.\r\n\r\nThe heavy land requires a good deal of harrowing, and the weeding and\r\nharvesting of the maize give employment to a comparatively large staff.\r\nThe estates are of moderate size, often only 50 hectares. Ownership\r\nwas not divided at the period of colonization, the land, thanks to the\r\nbreeders, having already acquired so high a value that the colonists\r\ncould not buy it. On the lands which have been farmed out there has\r\ndeveloped a rural, and often far from docile, proletariat. It is in\r\nthe maize region that the worst agricultural strikes have taken place.\r\nThe struggles of the owners and the colonists are the more prolonged\r\nbecause the sowing of the maize can be put back to the end of the\r\nspring without much harm being done. The adjoining zone of the Paraná\r\nproduced some of the _maiseros_ who have scattered over the north-west.\r\nBut the modern colonies include, in addition, a large proportion of\r\nimmigrants who have recently landed from Italy and Spain. The maize\r\ngrowers do not mix with the wheat-growers. Each group has its own area.\r\n\r\nThe increase of wheat-growing in the south dates only from 1898:\r\n\r\n  ------------------+----------------------------\r\n                    | Wheat Area (in kilometres).\r\n                    |------------+---------------\r\n                    |    1895    |     1908\r\n  ------------------+------------+---------------\r\n  Alsina            |     45     |    1,296\r\n  Puan              |     52     |    1,321\r\n  Suarez            |    104     |      978\r\n  La Madrid         |     75     |      249\r\n  Pringles          |     13     |      724\r\n  Darrego           |     --     |      885\r\n  Terr. de la Pampa |     --     |    1,731\r\n  ------------------+------------+----------------\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAP IV.--DENSITY OF THE MAIZE CROP.\r\n  _As it needs more heat and moisture than wheat, the maize does not go\r\n  so far to the west and south. It is concentrated for export at the\r\n  ports of the Rio de la Plata and the Paraná, especially at Rosario. The\r\n  Argentine \"corn belt,\" the chief maize area, extends back of Rosario\r\n  and San Nicolas to beyond Casilda and Pergamino._\r\n                                                       To face p. 198.]\r\n\r\nWheat first spread along the line from Buenos Aires to Bahía Blanca,\r\nwest of the Sierra de la Ventana, then in the coastal district,\r\neast of Bahía Blanca. These two wheat-areas became connected after\r\n1904, when the opening of the direct line from Olavarria to Buenos\r\nAires facilitated the development of the intermediate region\r\n(Pringles-Laprida). From Bahía Blanca it spread to the west and\r\nnorth-west along the Toay line, and southward as far as Colorado on\r\nthe coast. In the whole area of the Central Pampa it is still possible\r\nto distinguish two strata of immigrants, of different dates, one\r\nsuperimposed upon the other: the sheep-breeders and the farmers. Round\r\nToay the contrast between the two elements of the population is even\r\nmore striking, because the first pastoral colonization, which dates\r\nfrom 1890, was to a great extent the work of creole _puntanos_ (from\r\nthe San Luis province). The actual agricultural colonies, on the other\r\nhand, include recent European immigrants and colonists from other parts\r\nof the provinces of Buenos Aires and Entre Rios.\r\n\r\nThe yield of the wheat grows less and less as one goes westward. The\r\nharvest may be injured either by late frost or drought, or, especially,\r\nby hot winds which scorch the plants and blight the half-realized hopes\r\nof the farmers in the weeks just before the harvest. But the relative\r\npoorness of the return is compensated by the extent of the farms and\r\nthe cheapness of labour. The harvest is often done with machines that\r\npeel and pack the wheat, and the workers are not compelled, as they\r\nare at Santa Fé, to wait for the threshing machine. The aridity does\r\nnot permit flax-growing, but oats can be grown, especially between the\r\nSierra de la Ventana and the Sierra de Tandil; and it is good to sow\r\noats when the land has been impoverished by consecutive crops of wheat.\r\nExports of oats through Bahía Blanca began in 1906.\r\n\r\nThe displacement of breeding by farming is less thorough than in the\r\nmaize belt. Oats, sown about the beginning of autumn, serve for fodder.\r\nThe animals are kept in the fields during the winter, and the oats are\r\ncut and put into the mill, without being threshed, as a reserve fodder.\r\nMoreover, the wheat farmers have themselves taken to rearing sheep,\r\nand the sheep feed in the stubble and fallow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this short account of the history of colonization we draw certain\r\nimportant conclusions. At the time when agricultural colonization\r\nbegan, it was admitted that farming was the best way to exploit the\r\nsoil, and that the Pampa would sooner or later pass from the pastoral\r\nto the agricultural cycle; or, to use the local phraseology, that the\r\n\"colony\" would replace the ranch everywhere. This idea was wrong.\r\nThe only area in which the facts seem to give it any support is the\r\ncorn belt. The general rule is, on the contrary, that in its progress\r\ncolonization develops a mixed type of exploitation, combining farming\r\nand breeding; either one alternates with the other in a sort of\r\nperiodic rotation, as in the lucerne area, or both proceed together,\r\nthe farmers including breeding amongst their occupations, as in the\r\ndistrict of the Santa Fé colonies or in the wheat area in the south of\r\nthe Buenos Aires province.\r\n\r\nIt seems, moreover, that the development of colonization depends not\r\nonly upon physical conditions, but upon factors of a purely economic or\r\nsocial character, which the geographer must not overlook. It will be\r\nenough here to indicate the chief of these.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the part that has been played in the exploitation of\r\nthe soil by groups of colonists who swarm from one area to another.\r\nWhether we think of the ranchers of the eastern part of Buenos\r\nAires transplanting themselves to Córdoba or north of Santa Fé, the\r\nsheep-breeders moving westward, or the Santa Fé colonists settling in\r\nthe lucerne area, they all take with them their own habits and methods\r\nof work, and they take time to adjust them to a new environment.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAP V.--DENSITY OF THE WHEAT CROP.\r\n  _The wheat belt stretches in a broad section of a circle from Bahía\r\n  Blanca to Santa Fé, which is now reached by maritime vessels. The\r\n  cultivation of wheat crosses the line of 600 millimetres of rainfall,\r\n  and even the 400-millimetre line, in proportion as one passes from the\r\n  area of summer rain to that of spring and autumn rain._\r\n                                                       To face p. 200.]\r\n\r\nThe colonist, whether breeder or farmer, is not left to himself.\r\nColonization is sustained and directed by speculation in land, and\r\nis influenced by it. Speculation discounts the work of the colonist,\r\nand attaches to the land a value which is not based upon the revenue\r\nit has produced, but upon that which the speculator calculates that\r\nit may produce in the future. If the speculator is audacious, he does\r\nnot let himself be discouraged by initial bad experiences; it takes\r\nrepeated checks to exhaust his optimism. The colonist, even if his\r\nfarming accounts do not show a profit, may nevertheless gain something\r\nif the value of his land goes up. The increase of his capital conceals\r\nfrom him the smallness of his returns, especially as he can easily get\r\nadvances on the value of his property from the banks, and this enables\r\nhim to draw upon his wealth every year.\r\n\r\nSpeculation is concerned with new lands on the fringe of the area\r\nalready colonized, where the soil is, as a general rule, already in the\r\nhands of the exploiters themselves. The speculators, having paid a high\r\nprice for these lands, try to organize the development of them. It is\r\npartly owing to their influence that colonization continuously enlarges\r\nits domain, instead of concentrating its labour in the older districts\r\nwhere it might sometimes be more productive. In fine, speculation in\r\nland has a profound influence on the conditions of colonization, making\r\nit more difficult for the colonist to buy the land he is developing.\r\nThe owner who grants him the use of the land means to keep for himself\r\nany increment of its value. He rents, but he will not sell.\r\n\r\nThus the history of colonization cannot be separated from the\r\ntraffic in land. The special features of this traffic in the\r\nPampean region--its concentration at Buenos Aires; the creation of\r\na land-market resembling a stock market; the practice of selling on\r\nthe instalment plan, which enables small capitalists to enter the\r\nmarket; the repeated transfers of pieces of land which the buyers have\r\nnever seen and which they know only from plans--are one of the most\r\noriginal aspects of modern Argentina. They are partly due to a fact of\r\na geographical nature--the uniformity of the Pampean plain, on which\r\nevery piece of land is worth about as much as the adjoining piece.\r\n\r\nColonization is easy and rapid in proportion as it requires less\r\ncapital and labour. The expansion of breeding in the west between 1880\r\nand 1890 was facilitated by the low market price of cattle at that\r\ntime. Breeding has the advantage over farming of not needing so large\r\na staff, but it requires a larger capital. Of the crops, assuming that\r\nthe conditions of soil and climate are equally favourable, wheat is\r\nbetter than maize for colonization, because the preparing of the soil\r\nand the harvest can be done more speedily, and the same number of hands\r\ncan plant a larger area with wheat than with maize.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Argentine Government and the provincial authorities\r\nhas been restrained, apart from the earliest period of the\r\nestablishment of the Santa Fé colonies, both as regards the securing of\r\nimmigrants, the distribution of lands, and the administration of the\r\ncolonies.[101] Colonization has been, on the whole, a private affair.\r\nThe work of organizing colonization has at times been undertaken by\r\nthe proprietors themselves; they leased pieces of land and got a\r\ngood price for them, at the same time increasing the surplus value\r\nof the plots they kept for themselves by promoting the increase of\r\npopulation. Sometimes it was undertaken by Colonization Companies,\r\nwhich bought land to divide and sell. More frequently it was undertaken\r\nby merchants who advanced credit to the colonists they settled, on\r\ncondition that the colonists bought what they needed of the merchants,\r\nand entrusted them with the sale of their crops. The migration of the\r\nSanta Fé colonists was partly due to, and sustained by, a corresponding\r\nmigration of merchants who had acquired wealth in the older colonies,\r\nand who thus got a larger body of customers. The merchant who organizes\r\ncolonization often acts as the intermediary between the owner and\r\nthe colonist, guaranteeing the owner a fixed rent for his land and\r\nreceiving so much per cent. of his harvest from the farmer. This system\r\nis very widespread in the corn belt, but it is found all over the plain\r\nof the Pampas. It tends to disappear when the colony is older and\r\ndeeper-rooted, as the colonist gradually earns his independence; he\r\nbuys his lease, his equipment, and his furniture, and controls the sale\r\nof his own crops. In the districts where he has not become owner, the\r\nleases are generally variations of two types: farming leases, where the\r\ncolonist has capital enough for working, and renting leases, where the\r\ncapital is provided by the owner or the middleman.\r\n\r\n     [101] The Agricultural Centres Law, passed in 1887 by the\r\n     province of Buenos Aires to encourage colonization, has\r\n     not had good results. By the terms of this law, owners\r\n     who professed themselves willing to devote their lands to\r\n     colonization received an advance on the value of the lands\r\n     in the form of mortgages, the interest and repayment of the\r\n     mortgage being charged to the colonists. Many owners took\r\n     advantage of the law, but, after a pretence of colonization,\r\n     kept the ownership of their lands.\r\n\r\nLastly, colonization can make no progress unless it finds markets on\r\nwhich it can put its produce. Up to the present western Europe has\r\nbeen the chief market for the wool, leather, meat, and cereals of the\r\nPampean region; tropical America absorbs part of the output of the\r\n_saladeros_, flour, and dry fodder; and North America has recently\r\nbegun to compete with Europe for wool, leather, and frozen meat. The\r\nfacility with which the products of the Pampa have found their way into\r\nthe world's markets, as is seen in the comparative stability of the\r\nreturns, explains the continuous advance of colonization and the short\r\nduration of the crises which have disturbed it.\r\n\r\nThe home market, however, has had an importance in connection with\r\ncolonization that must not be overlooked. When wheat-growing spread\r\nat Santa Fé the crop was at first devoted to supplying Buenos Aires,\r\nand as late as 1883 Zeballos thought that the essential result of\r\nagricultural colonization was the fact that Chilean flour was beaten\r\noff the Argentine market. Even to-day the districts on the outskirts of\r\nthe cereal area depend upon the home market. The Villa Mercedes mill\r\nsupplies Mendoza. Córdoba and Santa Fé send their flour to Tucumán.\r\nThe price of cereals still shows slight fluctuations in these parts as\r\ncompared with prices in Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\n_Table of Exports of the Chief Products of the Pampean region_ (_in\r\nthousands of tons_):\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                 |  1901 |  1905 |  1910 |  1913 |  1914\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Wheat          |   904 | 2,868 | 1,883 | 2,812 |   980\r\n  Maize          | 1,112 | 2,222 | 2,660 | 4,806 | 3,542\r\n  Flax           |   338 |   654 |   604 | 1,016 |   841\r\n  Flour          |    71 |   144 |   115 |   124 |    67\r\n  Wool           |   228 |   191 |   150 |   120 |   117\r\n  Salted hides   |    28 |    40 |    61 |    65 |    63\r\n  Dried hides    |    26 |    24 |    29 |    21 |    14\r\n  Chilled beef   |    44 |   152 |   253 |   306 |   368\r\n  Chilled mutton |    63 |    78 |    75 |    45 |    58\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n     The heading \"cereals\" appears in the statistics of Argentine\r\n     exports in 1882. In 1900 the value of the agricultural produce\r\n     exported is equal to that of the products of breeding. In 1904\r\n     it is higher.\r\n\r\nPastoral colonization, again, has not been entirely independent of the\r\nhome market. Martin de Moussy says, it is true, that the area which\r\nsent the products of breeding to Europe in 1865 extended as far as the\r\nSierra de Córdoba. But this statement needs correction. The hides from\r\nthe whole of this zone were, in point of fact, sent down to the ports\r\non the Rio de la Plata, but live animals were sent to Chile from the\r\nwhole of the north-west of the Pampean region. It was for the purpose\r\nof selling cattle to Chile that ranches were multiplied about 1860 in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Villa Mercedes and lower down, on the Rio Quinto.\r\nJegou's description shows that even in 1883 the breeders of the San\r\nLuis province devoted themselves exclusively to supplying the Chilean\r\nmarket.[102] Buyers from Chile and the Andean provinces still visit\r\nVilla Mercedes, and until a recent date they came to Villa Maria, in\r\nthe province of Córdoba. The Santa Fé ranches found their customers,\r\nuntil the opening of the Córdoba line (1870) amongst the _troperos_,\r\nwho bought draught oxen for their waggons. The loss of these customers\r\nand the crisis that followed are one of the reasons why agricultural\r\ncolonization met with so little resistance on the part of the breeders,\r\nand was able to take root so easily at Santa Fé. In the San Cristobal\r\ndepartment the breeders who settled there after 1890 found their first\r\nmarket in the _obrajes_ of the neighbouring forest. The opening of the\r\nrailway to Tucumán afterwards enabled them to send their cattle to the\r\nprovinces of the north-west. The Buenos Aires buyers were late in this\r\nremote canton of the Pampean plain. They did not arrive until 1911.\r\n\r\n     [102] A. Jegou, \"Informe sobre la provincia de San Luis,\"\r\n     _Ann. Soc. Cientifica Argentina_, xvi. 1883, pp. 140-152,\r\n     192-200, and 223-230.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Pampean region itself as a market of consumption\r\ngrew in proportion to the increase of its population. The extent to\r\nwhich it absorbs the products of breeding and agriculture varies a\r\ngood deal. For some of them it is paramount. Horse-breeding, for\r\ninstance, which is still one of the great industries of the Pampa, has\r\nnever contributed to the export trade. It is the same with regard to\r\npotatoes, which are concentrated in two strictly limited districts,\r\nround Rosario and north of the Sierra de Tandil. Only a small part of\r\nthe dry fodder is exported. As regards cereals, a comparison of the\r\nstatistics of production with the statistics of export shows that the\r\nhome consumption is about one-third of the production. It is almost nil\r\nfor flax, and nearly fifty per cent for wheat.\r\n\r\nThe average of production and export for the years 1912, 1913, and\r\n1914, in thousands of tons, is:\r\n\r\n  ------------+--------+--------+-------+-----------------\r\n              |        |        |       |    Total\r\n              | Wheat. | Maize. | Flax. |(including Oats).\r\n  ------------+--------+--------+-------+-----------------\r\n  Production  | 4,241  | 6,398  |  931  |    12,662\r\n  Export      | 2,140  | 4,227  |  790  |     8,038\r\n  ------------+--------+--------+-------+-----------------\r\n\r\nAs the chief centres of consumption are the ports themselves, it\r\nfollows that the commercial currents that have to supply them are\r\nconfused with the currents which maintain the exports. The exchanges\r\nbetween the various regions of the Pampa are more interesting to the\r\ngeographer. In their tendency to specialize, these regions have ceased\r\nto be self-contained, and they have to look to adjoining regions. The\r\nfeeding of the mills necessitates the transport of wheat in different\r\ndirections. The chief mills are at Buenos Aires, where they are\r\nsuitably located to work both for the home market and for export; and\r\nthe mills in the interior have some difficulty in competing with them.\r\nSome of these, however, are still active. They mix hard wheat, bought\r\nin the district of the Santa Fé colonies, with the soft wheat that is\r\ngrown in the middle and south of Buenos Aires province.\r\n\r\nBut this inter-regional transport of cereals is a small thing in\r\ncomparison with the transport of cattle. The extension of the lucerne\r\nfarms has developed the fattening industry in many districts, while\r\nothers still confine themselves to breeding in the ordinary sense, and\r\nthey feed the other centres. The most specialized fattening district\r\nis that of Villa Mercedes and the western part of the lucerne belt,\r\nwhile the eastern part of the province of Buenos Aires and Entre Rios\r\nare still areas of production. The differentiation of the pastoral\r\nzones can be gathered from a study of the statistics. According to the\r\n1908 Census, milch cows represent 53 per cent. of the whole of the\r\ncattle in all the departments which form the heart of the breeding area\r\neast of Buenos Aires, and only 45 per cent. in the departments of the\r\nnorth-west of Buenos Aires and south of Córdoba and in the Pedernera\r\ndepartment of San Luis, where fattening is common.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 1914 Census oxen are 24 per cent. of the herd in the\r\nsame departments of eastern Buenos Aires; 24 per cent. also in Entre\r\nRios; and the proportion rises to 31 per cent. in the lucerne area.\r\nDolores department (eastern Buenos Aires) has 64 per cent. milch\r\ncows and 21 per cent. oxen. Pedernera department (San Luis, in the\r\nlucerne area) has 49 per cent. cows and 38 per cent. oxen. General\r\nRoca department (Córdoba) has 48 per cent. cows and 34 per cent.\r\noxen. Arenales (Buenos Aires) has 39 per cent. cows and 46 per cent.\r\noxen.[103]\r\n\r\n     [103] For Argentina as a whole the percentage is: milch cows,\r\n     55 per cent.; oxen, 26 per cent.\r\n\r\nOxen intended for the refrigerators are bought either on the ranches\r\nor at Buenos Aires, where beasts in good condition are consigned to\r\nbuyers, but oxen for fattening are bought at fairs which are held\r\nperiodically in the towns of the interior. Another transaction at these\r\nfairs is the trade in pedigree breeders. The best known of them is\r\nheld at Villa Mercedes (province of San Luis), where 8,000 oxen are\r\nsold every month. At the Mercedes fairs one may see Durham steers from\r\nthe east of Buenos Aires which are to be fattened and sent back to the\r\nrefrigerators or the slaughter-houses of Buenos Aires. There are also\r\ncreole cattle from the north of the San Luis province and Rioja which\r\nwill later be eaten in Mendoza or in Chile. There is, in fact, on the\r\nwestern frontier of the Pampa no line of demarcation corresponding to\r\nthat set up in the north by the limit of the area contaminated by the\r\n_garrapate_, separating the district of creole breeding from that of\r\nselective breeding. There is free communication here between the two\r\nzones, and the lucerne fields for fattening at Villa Mercedes are used\r\nin common by the breeders of the Pampa and of the bush.[104]\r\n\r\n     [104] A large number of the cattle which are to be fattened\r\n     are bought at the market in Buenos Aires; but these do not, as\r\n     a rule, come from the Pampean region.\r\n\r\n_Cultivated Areas in the Argentine Republic_ (_in square kilometres,\r\nalmost exclusively in the Pampean region_).\r\n\r\n  -----+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n       | Wheat. | Maize. | Oats.  | Flax.  | Lucerne.\r\n  -----+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n  1896 | 25,000 | 14,000 |    --  |  5,600 |  8,000\r\n  1900 | 33,000 | 12,000 |    --  |  6,000 | 15,000\r\n  1902 | 36,000 | 18,000 |    --  | 15,000 | 17,000\r\n  1905 | 56,000 | 22,000 |    700 | 10,000 | 29,000\r\n  1910 | 62,000 | 32,000 |  8,000 | 15,000 | 54,000\r\n  1912 | 69,000 | 38,000 | 12,000 | 17,000 | 59,000\r\n  1913 | 65,000 | 41,000 | 11,600 | 17,000 | 66,000\r\n  1914 | 62,000 | 42,000 | 11,400 | 17,000 |    --\r\n  -----+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n\r\n  _Exports for 1913, 1914, and 1915 at each port._\r\n\r\n  --------------+------+-------+-----+-----+-------+--------\r\n                |Wheat.| Maize.|Flax.|Oats.|Totals.|Average.\r\n  --------------+------+-------+-----+-----+-------+--------\r\n               {| 782  | 1,757 | 275 |  13 | 2,829 |}\r\n  Rosario      {| 242  | 1,952 | 248 |   1 | 2,445 |} 2,716\r\n               {| 717  | 1,790 | 366 |  -- | 2,875 |}\r\n                |      |       |     |     |       |\r\n               {| 441  | 1,389 | 246 | 240 | 2,318 |}\r\n  Buenos Aires {| 297  |   906 |  55 |  78 | 1,537 |} 2,051\r\n               {| 511  | 1,349 | 342 |  96 | 2,299 |}\r\n                |      |       |     |     |       |\r\n               {| 927  |     2 |  -- | 462 | 1,393 |}\r\n  Bahía Blanca {| 241  |    -- |  -- | 222 |   463 |} 1,075\r\n               {| 921  |    -- |  -- | 442 | 1,364 |}\r\n                |      |       |     |     |       |\r\n               {|   5  |   910 |  74 |  -- |   989 |}\r\n  S.

One cannot\r\nexpect to find in the scheme of routes over the Argentine plains the\r\nstern and obvious influence of natural conditions. The surface of these\r\nplains is, as a whole, broadly open to traffic. Still, the map of the\r\nroads bears much evidence of geographical exigencies.\r\n\r\nThe hills which rise like islands out of the alluvial plain are not all\r\nincapable of being crossed, and the roads do not always skirt them. The\r\nroad from Buenos Aires to Peru runs north of 30° 40' S. lat. on the\r\nvery axis of the granite peneplain which forms the northern part of the\r\nSierra de Córdoba. The Dean Funes ridge, which begins with an altitude\r\nof 2,500 feet between the Sierra Chica and these tablelands, has always\r\nbeen used for communication between Córdoba and the north-western\r\nprovinces. There the railway has taken the place of the primitive\r\ntrack. Another important track crosses the Sierra de Córdoba in the\r\nnorth of the Pampa de Achala, and used to join Córdoba with Villa\r\nDolores and the north of the San Luis province. The southern part of\r\nthe Sierra de Córdoba and the Sierra de San Luis are, on the other\r\nhand, an insurmountable obstacle, which diverts southward the high road\r\nto Chile _via_ Achiras, San José, del Morro, and San Luis.\r\n\r\nThe sierras of the Buenos Aires province are not so high and extensive.\r\nThey are, moreover, broken into isolated hills with the plain passing\r\nbetween them. As early as 1822 Colonel Garcia pointed out the\r\nimportance, in connection with the migrations of the Indian tribes,\r\nof the passage between the Sierra Amarilla and the Sierra de Curaco,\r\nthat is to say, the Olavarria ridge. It is there that the first railway\r\nbetween Buenos Aires and Bahía Blanca crosses the line of sierras. It\r\nthen skirts the Sierra de la Ventana, to the north, by the Pigüe ridge,\r\nbetween the mass of Curumalan and the Puan hills. The dunes of the\r\nwestern Pampa also are an impediment to traffic, not so much because\r\nof their height as because of the looseness of the ground. The strip\r\nbetween General Acha and Toay was very trying for the stage-coaches.\r\nTravellers had to cross the dunes on foot during the winter season,\r\nwhen the horses were in a bad condition.[105]\r\n\r\nNatural supplies of water increase in number as one gets away from the\r\nAndean zone toward the east. Still, the chief work, often the only\r\nwork, to be done in making a road is the arrangement of permanent\r\nsupplies of water. Martin de Moussy mentions the digging of wells on\r\nthe new road from Córdoba to Rosario, which was opened about 1860.\r\nThe _aiguade_ was generally a _represa_, a reservoir, where the water\r\naccumulated behind a barrier of earth raised across the course of an\r\nintermittent stream. The upkeep of the _represa_ is the chief duty of\r\nthe post-master. The edge of the sierras and the opening point of the\r\nravines which come down them is a good place for making _represas_,\r\nand the roads frequently keep to these (variant of the road from\r\nCórdoba to Tucumán _via_ Totoral, Dormida, Rio Seco and Sumampa, on\r\nthe eastern edge of the Sierra de Córdoba, etc.) Long stages with no\r\nwater supplies, the _travesías_, are not found on the made roads, as a\r\nrule, except west of the meridian, of Córdoba. However, the direct road\r\nfrom Santa Fé to Santiago del Estero by the lagoon of Los Porongos,\r\nwhich was used in the eighteenth century, seems to have been abandoned\r\nafterwards, as much on account of the difficulty of supplying water as\r\nbecause it was exposed to attack from the Indians.\r\n\r\n     [105] J. B. Ambrosetti, \"Viàje a la Pampa central,\" _Bol.\r\n     Instit. Geog. Argent._, xiv. 1893, pp. 292-368.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN OX WAGON.\r\n                        Photograph by Soc.

To face p. 210.]\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty which the caravans encountered on the roads over\r\nthe plain was the crossing of the rivers. They were forded. Fords with\r\na muddy bottom on the lower course of the rivers, such as that on the\r\nSaladillo near the confluence of the Rio Tercero, were more difficult\r\nfor wagons than the fords with sandy bottoms in the upper course, near\r\nthe fringe of the mountains, such as those of the Rio Tercero on the\r\nCórdoba road, or of the Rio Cuarto on the road to Chile. After rain,\r\ncertain parts of the plain are flooded and impassable. That is the case\r\nin the district to the south of the lower Salado, at the very spot\r\nwhere Père Cardiel notices the lack of water in the dry season (1747).\r\nThe direct road from Buenos Aires to the sierras was at that point\r\nexposed, alternately, to drought and flood. The line of the Southern\r\nrailway, which crosses this low district, is still cut periodically on\r\nboth sides of Las Flores by floods. The lack of an organized network of\r\nstreams, the irregularity of the rains, the difficulty of ascertaining\r\nthe inclination, and the flow of the waters over a plain which seems to\r\nthe eye to be perfectly level, have led to more than one miscalculation\r\non the part of the railways, which were constructed hurriedly, and\r\nbefore the general survey of the Pampa was finished. Some lines, on the\r\nPampa or on the Chaco, have had to be partially reconstructed, and\r\nraised higher, after a series of rainy years.[106]\r\n\r\n     [106] Certain duplications in the actual scheme of the\r\n     railways are due to this need to correct a line that had\r\n     been planned hastily and was useless. The line from Justo\r\n     Daract to La Paz (1912), on the Pacific railway, avoids the\r\n     steep inclinations of the first line, which followed the\r\n     course of the wagon-road _via_ San Luis. The interpretation\r\n     of the relief is particularly difficult in a country which\r\n     has not been shaped by normal erosion. Blunders detected by\r\n     later topographical inquiries were similarly committed in\r\n     constructing the Patagonian railways.\r\n\r\nThe colonization of that part of the plain which actually constitutes\r\nthe province of Buenos Aires was late. It belongs to the era of the\r\nrailways. There is only one historic road crossing this area, which\r\nremained until the last third of the nineteenth century in the hands\r\nof the Indian tribes. This is the salt road. We do not know exactly\r\nwhen it began to be used. In the eighteenth century, in spite of the\r\ncompetition of salt from Cadiz and Patagonia, imported by sea, the\r\nPampa salt was the main part of the supply of Buenos Aires. The salt\r\nroad was not abandoned until after 1810. We still have the diary of\r\nseveral journeys from Buenos Aires to the salt-pits. They were military\r\nexpeditions. Hundreds of wagons, with a strong escort, collected at\r\nLujan and Chivilcoy, and they reached Atreuco, west of the Guamini and\r\nCarbuë lakes, after a fifteen to twenty-five days' march.\r\n\r\nThe itinerary was fixed in detail. In 1796 D'Azara noticed the wells\r\nsunk by the salters, north of the Palentelen lagoon (Bragado), when\r\nthey found the lagoon dry. From Palentelen south-westward the salt\r\nroad followed the track used by the Indians of the south-west in their\r\nexpeditions against the ranches of the Buenos Aires frontier. Near Lake\r\nEpecuen, north of Carbuë, it was joined by another track which came\r\nfrom Olavarria, the stages of which were marked by the streams that\r\ncame from the Sierra de Curumalan. The Carbuë district, the cross-roads\r\nof the tracks, was one of the places where the tribes collected. \"This\r\nplace,\" says the diary of the 1778 expedition, \"is the first point\r\nwhere the hostile Indians meet and rest when they leave the Sierra\r\nand on returning from their invasions. They not only rest there, but\r\nhave their winter pasture there\" (in the dry season).[107] Zeballos\r\nhas described the Indian track, the _rustrillada_, between Epecuen,\r\nAtreuco and Traru Lauquen, where the _travesia_ on the road to Chile\r\nbegan.[108] It was not less than 1,000 feet in width. At the foot of\r\nthe dunes there were deep parallel grooves made by the feet of the\r\nraided cattle, which were taken away by the \"Chileños.\"\r\n\r\n     [107] Coll. de Angelis, v.\r\n\r\n     [108] Est. Zeballos, _Descripción amena de la Republica\r\n     Argentina_, vol. i, \"Viàje al païs de los Araucanos\" (Buenos\r\n     Aires, 1881).\r\n\r\nThe two main roads of the colonial period are the roads to Chile and\r\nPeru. On leaving Buenos Aires there was one road for a distance of\r\nabout 320 miles. The \"trade road\" passed through Lujan, Areco and\r\nSauce, and reached the Carcaraña, or Rio Tercero, at Esquina. It\r\ntherefore kept at some distance from the Paraná (32 to 16 miles), on\r\nthe tableland, crossing the valleys which were embedded in it and\r\nrepresented so many bad parts. It then ascended the Tercero on the\r\nright bank as far as the Paso Fereira, at the spot where Villa Maria is\r\nto-day. At Esquina de Medrano (Villa Maria) the road to Chile branched\r\noff to the south-east, reached San Luis by following the Rio Cuarto,\r\ngoing through Achiras and San José del Morro, and, after a _travesia_\r\nseventy-eight miles in length, came to the Rio Tunuyan at La Paz, and\r\nascended the river to Mendoza.[109]\r\n\r\n     [109] Martin de Moussy says that a more direct route, avoiding\r\n     the detour to the north by the Rio Tercero, was followed in\r\n     the eighteenth century between Buenos Aires and San Luis, by\r\n     way of Salto and the Rio Quinto as far as the latitude of\r\n     fort Constitución (Villa Mercedes). Woodbine Parish's map\r\n     (1839) and Napp's map (1876) both show a road by way of Salto\r\n     and Melincue to the Rio Cuarto, where it joins the ordinary\r\n     road. However that may be, these roads were never used\r\n     regularly, from fear of the Indians or--which comes to the\r\n     same thing--because the area they cross, in the south of the\r\n     actual territory of the provinces of Santa Fé and Córdoba, was\r\n     not yet colonized.\r\n\r\nFrom Esquina de Medrano the Peru road made for Córdoba in the\r\nnorth-west. From the tablelands which continue the Sierra de Córdoba\r\nnorthward it descended toward the Rio Dulce, which it reached west of\r\nAtamisqui, and which it followed as far as Santiago del Estero, where\r\nit crossed to the north bank. It crossed the Sali in the latitude of\r\nTucumán, and, passing through Tracas and Metan, followed the depression\r\nwhich separates the Andes from the sub-Andean chains. From Salta it\r\nwent north to Jujuy, and passed through the Quebrada de Humahuaca to\r\nreach the Puna.\r\n\r\nThe influence of rivers is not much seen in the scheme of the primitive\r\nroads. There were in the sixteenth century many routes from Peru to\r\nthe Paraguay, across the Chaco, but not a permanent road in the strict\r\nsense. In the eighteenth century there was a direct road from Santa Fé\r\nto Tucumán, by the north of the Los Porongos lagoon and the course of\r\nthe Rio Dulce. There was another from Santa Fé to Córdoba. These roads\r\nwere not exclusively used for conveying cattle. The river route which\r\nthey joined at Santa Fé provided them with a certain amount of traffic\r\ncoming from the higher provinces. Paraguayan _maté_ reached the Andean\r\nregions by this road, and in return the boatmen at Santa Fé loaded\r\nup with the wines and dried fruit of the Andean provinces to take to\r\nAsunciôn.\r\n\r\nThe question of joining the road on to a river was not of very great\r\nimportance until the time when the Paraná began to be used for\r\nArgentine imports and exports, and to maintain the communication of\r\nthe interior provinces with Europe. This question of connection with a\r\nriver controls the history of the construction of the railway system.\r\nBut the great importance of it can be seen from the first half of\r\nthe nineteenth century. D'Orbigny had a presentiment of it. Speaking\r\nof the future of Santa Fé, he says: \"When peace is restored, it is\r\ncertain that the wares of Córdoba may, instead of going by land from\r\nthat town to Buenos Aires, be sent to Santa Fé, where shipping them to\r\nthe Argentine capital will reduce to one-third the journey by land,\r\nwhich is always more costly than going by water.\" Martin de Moussy,\r\nforeseeing the making of a road across the Chaco from Tucumán to the\r\nParaná, in the latitude of Corrientes, calculates that Corrientes may\r\nlater serve as port for part of the west and north of Argentina. At the\r\ndate of the publication of his book, however, it was neither Santa Fé\r\nnor Corrientes, but the new town Rosario, that began to play the part\r\nof interior port, and led to the construction of a new system of roads.\r\nTraffic between Rosario and Córdoba at first followed the old road\r\nfrom Buenos Aires to Peru, which one struck after leaving Rosario and\r\nmaking a detour to the south-west, on the right bank of the Carcaraña\r\n(at Rio Tercero). But this itinerary was presently replaced by a direct\r\nroad to the west-northwest, following the line which the railways would\r\nadopt.[110]\r\n\r\n     [110] Between 1852 and 1862, during the period when relations\r\n     were suspended between the Argentine Confederation and Buenos\r\n     Aires, there was a beginning of a general reorganization of\r\n     the roads in harmony with the new political conditions. The\r\n     road from Santa Fé and Paraná to Concepción (in Uruguay)\r\n     across the Entre Rios tablelands, and from there to\r\n     Montevideo, had owed its initial importance to the closing of\r\n     the lower Paraná under Rosas, and Woodbine Parish records that\r\n     there was already a good deal of smuggling there. This road\r\n     became an essential artery when Paraná made itself the federal\r\n     capital under Urquiza. He intended to connect Paraná with the\r\n     western provinces, and he created a mail service from Santa Fé\r\n     to Córdoba. Ephemeral as the good fortune of Paraná was, its\r\n     influence on the organization of the roads of Argentina was\r\n     too material to be ignored by the geographer.\r\n\r\nIn the greater part of Argentina transport was by means of wagons\r\nbefore railways were constructed. The limit between the area of\r\nwagon-transport and the area in which goods were conveyed on the backs\r\nof animals is quite stable. It is still of some significance, in\r\nspite of the development of the railways; wagons and mules are used\r\nat each station to collect and distribute goods. The area of farming\r\nand of selective breeding on the Pampa, the sheep-area in Patagonia,\r\nand the timber belt on the Chaco, still make use of wagons; and goods\r\nare carried on the backs of mules in the Andean area. The Peru road\r\nwas, broadly speaking, fit for wagons as far as Salta, but it is rough\r\nbetween Tucumán and Salta, and wagons that used it generally stopped\r\nat Salta. In this way wagons avoided the ford of the Sali, which was\r\neasier for mules. On the plain itself the water-sources were often so\r\ndistant from each other, and the stages so long, that mules had to\r\nbe used instead of wagons. Wagons could easily get to Mendoza by the\r\nroad along which the Tunuyan runs at its driest section, but all the\r\nconvoys from Córdoba to San Juan, or Rioja to Catamarca, were composed\r\nof mules. Hence Córdoba was, like Tucumán, a station for changing on\r\nthe road from Buenos Aires to the north-west. Lastly, while the scrub\r\npresented no insuperable obstacle to wagons, they could not enter the\r\nhumid tropical forest, where the soil never dries. On the fringe of the\r\nMisiones forest, the wagons that came from San Tome unloaded at San\r\nJavier, and mules took the goods on to the _yerbales_.\r\n\r\nThe two areas of different kinds of transport were not sharply\r\ndistinct. The muleteers (_arrieros_) sometimes avoided the domain of\r\nthe wagoners, and competed with them as far as the banks of the Paraná.\r\nIn 1860 (Hutchinson) the muleteers carried about a fifth, in weight, of\r\nthe goods from the interior to Rosario, and they got more than a third\r\nof the transport from Rosario to the interior. They had, however, to\r\noffer to carry goods at two-thirds the price charged by the wagoners.\r\nIt appears that this invasion by the muleteers is connected with\r\na transport-crisis in the Andean area, which left a number of the\r\nSan Juan muleteers without work. It did not last. By 1862 mule-back\r\ntransport between Rosario and the interior was almost over.\r\n\r\nThe wagons of the Argentine plain have often been described by\r\ntravellers. They were heavy vehicles, carrying 150, sometimes 180,\r\n_arrobes_ (1,725 to 2,070 kgs.), covered with a leather hood stretched\r\non hoops. A long spur decorated with ostrich feathers was balanced\r\non a ring fixed in the roof, and was used to guide the front pair of\r\noxen. An earthenware pot containing water enough for each stage hung\r\nbetween the rear uprights. As a rule, three pair of oxen were yoked to\r\nit, one pair being in the shafts. At Corrientes it was necessary to\r\ncross the marshes and _esteros_, and a special type of wagon had been\r\nevolved. It had a sort of horizontal division forming an upper story,\r\nand the driver sat in this. Everywhere, on the Pampa as well as at\r\nCorrientes, the wheels were enormous; sometimes, as Darwin says, ten\r\nfeet in diameter. They were, therefore, able to get through the bad\r\nparts. Mud was, as a matter of fact, the worst enemy of the convoys.\r\nThe soil of the Pampa is clayey and soft in the districts near the\r\nriver. As the road was not limited in width, the wagons turned to the\r\nright or the left when the ruts became too deep, and the track in time\r\ncovered a broad belt of ground. This, however, could not be done in the\r\nvicinity of towns, where the traffic was concentrated. Buenos Aires\r\ncame to be surrounded by formidable quagmires that dried up only in the\r\nsummer. The paving of the streets and environs was becoming a problem\r\nof national importance when the construction of the railway began.\r\n\r\nWagons did not travel singly. The _tropero_, or contractor for\r\ntransport, organized caravans. In peaceful districts, where no military\r\nescort was required, the convoys could be split up; they consisted,\r\nas a rule, of from fifteen to fifty wagons. Besides the six oxen\r\nyoked to the wagon, there had to be others for relief as well as\r\nhorses for the staff. Usually they allowed ten oxen to each wagon; in\r\nexceptional cases twenty.[111] The convoy to the salt-lakes in 1778\r\nhad no less than 12,000 oxen to 600 wagons. There was a driver to each\r\nwagon, but there had also to be drivers for the starting animals, and\r\ncarpenters to make repairs. The leader of the caravan, the _capataz_,\r\nwas generally a master-carpenter. He looked after the interests of the\r\n_tropero_. There were about three men to each wagon. The _carreros_\r\nwere an original type, nomadic, and very different in costume and\r\ncharacter from the _gauchos_ (breeders) of the plain. At the close of\r\nthe eighteenth century Buenos Aires had more than a thousand wagons\r\nemployed in the traffic to Mendoza and Tucumán (Borrero).\r\n\r\n     [111] According to the details given us by De Angelis (1837,\r\n     Introduction to the _Diario del viaje al Rio Bermejo de Fray\r\n     Francisco Moritto_, Coll. de Angelis, vol. vi) a convoy of\r\n     fourteen wagons from Salta to Tucumán required three relays of\r\n     oxen. The first, comprising a hundred animals, went from Salta\r\n     to Tucumán; the second, of 130 animals, went from Tucumán to\r\n     the Buenos Aires frontier; the third (84 animals), went on to\r\n     the capital. The first and last relays were hired animals, the\r\n     second alone being the property of the _tropero_.\r\n\r\nThe stages were rarely more than four or five leagues of five\r\nkilometres each (thirteen to sixteen miles). At this rate it took a\r\nconvoy forty to fifty days to go from Buenos Aires to Mendoza, thirty\r\ndays from Rosario to Tucumán, three months (with the necessary rests)\r\nfrom Buenos Aires to Salta.[112] When water ran short, the journey\r\nmight be greatly prolonged, as the animals could do less work, or not\r\nwork at all if the _aiguades_ had dried up. The season was a matter for\r\nconsideration. In the Buenos Aires district the winter made the ground\r\nsodden and traffic difficult. Farther north, winter is the dry season,\r\nso that pasture was scarce, and it was difficult to feed the _tropas_.\r\nThe summer had difficulties of its own. In January and February the\r\nfloods of the Rio Dulce often made it impossible to cross the ford at\r\nSantiago. The carriers preferred to start from the northern provinces\r\nabout the end of the summer, in April or May. The best season for\r\nleaving Buenos Aires was the spring, from August to November. In this\r\nway each _tropa_ could make the double journey once a year.\r\n\r\n     [112] Thirty days from Buenos Aires to Mendoza, and seventy\r\n     days from Buenos Aires to Jujuy, says Barrero (F. Barrero,\r\n     _Descripción de las Provincias del Rio de la Plata_, end of\r\n     the eighteenth century, published by the Ministry of Foreign\r\n     Affairs, Buenos Aires, 1911).\r\n\r\nThere had been attempts to speed up the transport before the railways\r\nwere made. The _galera_ (diligence), with its swarm of horses harnessed\r\nwith the _cincha_ (saddle to which the lasso was attached), did\r\nnot carry goods. It did not replace the convoy of wagons, but the\r\n_tropilla_ of spare horses which travellers on the plain drove before\r\nthem. The _galera_ went from Rosario to Córdoba in three days and to\r\nMendoza in ten days, and from Córdoba to Salta in fourteen days. About\r\n1860 a quicker goods service was organized, light wagons drawn by mules\r\nreplacing the ox-wagons. They made the journey from Rosario to Córdoba\r\nin six days. Similarly, on the Pampa, the ox-wagons had been replaced\r\nbefore 1889 by quicker wagons, drawn by horses, to convey wool from the\r\nranches to the railway stations.\r\n\r\nThe cost of transport by wagon was, naturally, high. It also varied\r\na good deal, but we cannot possibly go into these variations here.\r\nIt will be enough to give, by way of illustration, the details which\r\nHutchinson gives for the year 1862. The freightage was fixed either for\r\na complete load of 150 _arrobes_ (1,725 kgs.) or so much per _arrobe_\r\n(11-1/2 kgs.). Conveying a load from Rosario to Córdoba cost forty\r\nto fifty piastres (eight to ten pounds). The cost of carrying an\r\n_arrobe_ from Rosario to Mendoza was five to six _reales_ (about two\r\nshillings to two-and-six); from Rosario to Tucuman nine _reales_ (three\r\nshillings and fourpence); from Rosario to Salta eighteen _reales_\r\n(seven shillings and sixpence). The tropas were, therefore, quickly\r\nousted by the railways. In a few places they made a very unequal fight\r\nagainst the railways. The _Memoria del departemento de Ingenieros de la\r\nNacion_ of 1876, quoted by Rebuelto, mentions the competition of the\r\n_tropas_ with the Andino railway, opened from Villa Maria to the Rio\r\nCuarto in 1873 and to Villa Mercedes in 1875. The merchants of San Juan\r\nand Mendoza continued to use them. The railway had to sign a contract\r\nwith the _troperos_ by which wagons were to bring goods as far as Villa\r\nMercedes, where they could be entrained. The total freight was fifty\r\nBolivian _centavos_ (about two shillings) per _arrobe_ from Mendoza to\r\nRosario, and sixty _centavos_ from San Juan. Of this the share of the\r\nrailway was fifteen _centavos_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first Argentine railway was opened in 1859, between Buenos Aires\r\nand Maron, a distance of about thirteen miles.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the Argentine railways formed two independent systems. The\r\nfirst radiated fan-wise from Buenos Aires (Western line, open as far\r\nas Chivilcoy in 1870, and Southern line, open as far as Chascomus\r\nin 1865). Farther north a line (the Central Argentine) started from\r\nRosario, and reached Bellville in 1866 and Córdoba in 1870.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THRESHING ON THE PAMPA.\r\n                        Photograph by Soc. Fotografica de Aficionados.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SACKS OF WHEAT READY FOR LOADING ON THE RAILWAY.\r\n  _There are elevators only in a few of the ports._\r\n                         Photograph by Soc.

To face p. 220.]\r\n\r\nThe political isolation of Buenos Aires between 1852 and 1862, during\r\nthe time when the first concessions were issued, made upon the railway\r\nsystem an impression that would not be effaced until twenty-five years\r\nafterwards. It was not until 1886 that Rosario was connected by rail\r\nwith Buenos Aires. The line to Mendoza and Chile, begun in 1870 (F. C.\r\nAndino), joins the line from Rosario to Córdoba. It reached Mendoza\r\nat the foot of the Andes before going on to Buenos Aires; and it was\r\nin 1888 that the Pacific railway was completed between Buenos Aires\r\nand Villa Mercedes, and established direct communications between the\r\ncapital and the province of Cuyo.\r\n\r\nThe line from Rosario to Córdoba is, therefore, the chief branch\r\nround which the Argentine system developed. It is remarkable that at\r\nthe time of the original concession in 1855 a westward extension was\r\ncontemplated, and that there was some idea of making it a stage in\r\na trans-Andean. The first concessionaire, Wheelwright, had made the\r\noldest railway in South America, from Caldera to Copiapo, in Chile in\r\n1851. The 1855 concession authorized Wheelwright to extend the Córdoba\r\nline westward and link it with the Copiapo line. When he opened the\r\nCórdoba station in 1870, Wheelwright, not suffering himself to be\r\ndiscouraged at the slowness with which the line had crossed the Pampa,\r\nstill said that the goal was the Pacific, by way of Rioja, Copacabana\r\nand the San Francisco pass. This ambitious programme deserves to be\r\nrecalled, if only as a reminiscence of the former orientation of the\r\ntrade of Rioja and Tinogasta toward the Pacific, and as a proof of the\r\nimportance, in the imagination of the men of that generation, of the\r\nold trans-Andean roads from north-western Argentina.\r\n\r\nEven before the Rosario line had reached Córdoba, it had been continued\r\nnorthward as far as Tucumán. The work was pushed vigorously, and\r\nTucumán was reached in 1875. The Córdoba-Tucumán line was the first to\r\nbe constructed entirely in the region of the scrub, and _quebracho_\r\nsleepers were then used for the first time. The earliest lines of the\r\nBuenos Aires province and the Argentine had, on the model of the Indian\r\nrailways, a gauge of 5 feet 8 inches, but the Central Córdoba, from\r\nCórdoba to Tucumán, had a narrow gauge of forty inches. Hence goods\r\ncoming from Tucumán had to be transferred at Córdoba. At the same time\r\n(1875) the line from Concordia to Monte Caseros was opened, and this\r\nmade it possible to avoid the rapids of the Uruguay, which was to be\r\na source of supply to the whole Mesopotamian system. Its gauge was\r\nfifty-seven inches. Differences of gauge are, and will continue to be,\r\none of the characteristics of the Argentine system.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from 1875 to 1890 were constructed the main lines\r\nwhich took the place of the old roads from province to province. The\r\nAndean railway reached San Luis in 1882 and Mendoza and San Juan in\r\n1885. Branches of the Central Córdoba reached Santiago del Estero in\r\n1884 and Catamarca in 1889. In 1891 the Central Argentine opened a new\r\ndirect broad-gauge line from Rosario to Tucumán; and almost at the\r\nsame time the narrow-gauge line of the Central Norte, from Santa Fé to\r\nTucumán, was finished further north. The Tucumán line was continued\r\nnorthward to the foot of the Andes as far as Salta. In the province\r\nof Buenos Aires the Bahía Blanca line was opened in 1884. Since 1900\r\nthe railways have pushed on to the frontiers and are linked in various\r\ndirections with those of the adjoining countries. The Cumbre tunnel on\r\nthe Mendoza trans-Andean was completed in 1910, and traffic with Chile\r\nby rail is now permanent. The Salta line was continued in 1908 to the\r\nBolivian tableland. In Mesopotamia, in fine, the north-eastern line\r\nreached Posadas in 1911 and effected a junction with the Paraguay line.\r\n\r\nThese details, however, give a very imperfect idea of the history of\r\nthe development of the Argentine railway system. It has not merely been\r\nsuperimposed upon the old roads, but has, on the other hand, helped\r\nto open up and develop new lands, which could not have been colonized\r\nwithout it. As early as 1883 Valiento Noailles, examining the general\r\nplan of the system, noticed the profound difference between the\r\nrailways of Argentine and those of Europe. \"In Europe,\" he said, \"the\r\nrailways are constructed to serve existing centres of production and\r\nconsumption.... Our Argentine railways are to facilitate colonization.\"\r\nCorresponding to each occupation of a new area of the Pampean plain by\r\nthe farmer or the breeder is the construction in that area of a new\r\nnetwork of lines which are fed by its traffic and in turn help it to\r\nincrease its production. The more productive the region is, the closer\r\nare the meshes of this network. They are wider in the pastoral than in\r\nthe agricultural areas. The period of the development of the southern\r\nlines in the province of Buenos Aires corresponds with the expansion\r\nof breeding when the Pampa had been pacified. The railway reached Azul\r\nin 1876. The Ayacucho branch was opened in 1880, and continued as far\r\nas Tres Arroyos in 1887. The completion of the Bahía Blanca line, via\r\nAzul and Olavarria, in 1884, is itself merely one of the dates in this\r\ncolonizing period. The great period of agricultural colonization at\r\nSanta Fé and the construction of the system of lines that serve it\r\nbegin a little later, and last from 1880 to 1890 (extension of the\r\nCentral Argentine system, the railways of the province of Santa Fé, and\r\nthe narrow-gauge railway from Rosario to Córdoba).\r\n\r\nThe part that the railway has played in colonization is plainly seen\r\nin the present completion of the system which has developed freely on\r\nthe even surface of the Pampean plain. The lines radiate round the\r\nport of Buenos Aires and, in a less degree, round the ports of Rosario\r\nand Bahía Blanca. What seems at first sight to be the symmetry of the\r\nrailway map will be found on closer examination to be less perfect;\r\nwhile the Atlantic coast between La Plata and Bahía Blanca has no\r\nports, the Paraná has quite a number of suitable places for shipping\r\ncereals. La Plata, San Nicolas and Villa Constitución are served by\r\nlines which cut across the lines going to Rosario and Buenos Aires.\r\nThis complexity of the system west of the Paraná continues to the north\r\nof Rosario, where the lines that go to Santa Fé cut across all the\r\nlines going to Rosario. The lines which run along the southern frontier\r\nof the province of Buenos Aires (at Juancho, Necochea, etc.) have,\r\nunlike the lines serving the secondary parts of the Paraná, all their\r\ntraffic directed toward the interior, and they serve only to bring to\r\nBuenos Aires and Bahía Blanco the crops of the districts they cross.\r\nThey are dependencies of the main lines of the southern system, and not\r\nrival lines.\r\n\r\nWhen the most fertile part of the Pampean plain, on which there is a\r\nregular rainfall to guarantee the crops, had been completely colonized\r\nand covered with railways, the national Government took up the policy\r\nof colonization by rail in the national territories. The minister Ramos\r\nMejia has attached his name to this work. It has been suspended since\r\nthe beginning of the war, but it filled the last period of construction\r\nof the Argentine railways. Ramos Mejia's railways include the lines\r\npenetrating the Chaco opened toward the north-west from Resistencia\r\nand Formosa, and the lines leading to the interior of Patagonia from\r\nthe ports of San Antonio, Puerto Deseado, and Rivadavia. We must add\r\nthe line from Neuquen to the Andes, made by the Southern Company, but\r\nwith a Government subvention.[113] These lines, serving districts with\r\nlittle population and inadequate resources, will not for a long time\r\nmake any profit.[114]\r\n\r\n     [113] The line from Bahía Blanca to the Rio Negro, of which\r\n     the Neuquen line is a continuation, was constructed in 1896.\r\n\r\n     [114] The continuation of many of these lines was contemplated\r\n     for the future, so as to secure for them at a later date a\r\n     long-distance traffic. The Resistencia and Formosa lines,\r\n     which reach the Andes, may compete for traffic with the\r\n     Rosario and Tucumán lines. In Patagonia, the continuation\r\n     across the Andes of the line from San Antonio to Lake Nahuel\r\n     Huapi has been considered. A pass has been found at a height\r\n     of 4,000 feet. When this plan is carried out, the Trans-Andean\r\n     from Nahuel Huapi would be in a position to compete\r\n     successfully with the Trans-Andean from Uspallata, which is\r\n     condemned by its elevation to remain a passenger line. These\r\n     plans, still far from realization, do not deprive the Ramos\r\n     Mejia lines of their character as colonization lines, entirely\r\n     devoted at present to conveying the timber of the Chaco and\r\n     the wool of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nHence railway construction must be regarded in modern Argentina as\r\none of the aspects of the problem of developing the soil. The railway\r\ncompanies have been compelled to intervene directly in the work\r\nof colonization. In 1863 the Central Argentine received from the\r\nGovernment a strip of land three miles wide on each side of the line it\r\nwas making, between Rosario and Córdoba, on condition that it colonized\r\nthe land. The company had its own immigration agents and its colonizing\r\nstaff, and it opened its first colonies west of Rosario between 1870\r\nand 1872. This kind of concession is exceptional in Argentina. On the\r\nother hand, the irrigation law of 1909 obliges the railway companies to\r\nundertake, on behalf of the Government, the work that is necessary to\r\ndevelop irrigation in the areas they serve, such work being immediately\r\nreflected in an increase of population and traffic. In compliance with\r\nthis law the Southern railway is constructing a canal which will water\r\nthe whole valley of the Rio Negro below the confluence of the Neuquen.\r\nThe Central Argentine and the Pacific also have undertaken to construct\r\ndams on the Rio Tercero and Rio Quinto, in the provinces of Córdoba and\r\nSan Luis.\r\n\r\nAs it is the essential function of a railway to convey the produce of\r\nthe area it serves to the exporting port, the problem of the relations\r\nbetween the administration of railways and the administration of\r\nports is of primary importance. The chief ports served by different\r\ncompanies, such as Rosario and Buenos Aires, may maintain their\r\nindependence, but a secondary port will be at the mercy of the single\r\nline which conveys goods to it. In such circumstances the ports have\r\nbecome, in many cases, mere dependencies of the railways. The port of\r\nColastiné belongs to the railways of the Santa Fé province. The port\r\nof Bahía Blanca consists of a number of distinct ports constructed by\r\nthe different railway companies, and run by them. Each of them ships\r\nthe goods which it brings. The port Ingeniero White, which belongs to\r\nthe Southern Company, was constructed in 1885, immediately after the\r\nopening of the line from Buenos Aires to Bahía Blanca. Puerto Galvan\r\nbelongs to the Pacific Company. Puerto Belgrano is the port of the line\r\nfrom Rosario to Bahía Blanca. At Buenos Aires the Southern Railway\r\nCompany has acquired control of the Buenos Aires Southern Dock Company.\r\nAt La Plata it manages the docks.\r\n\r\nThe spread of agricultural colonization was at first hampered by the\r\ncost of freightage which cereals could bear over an area with a radius\r\nof about 200 miles from the ports. That is the figure given by Girola\r\nin the _Investigación Agricola_ of 1904. The period 1895-1905 saw the\r\nbirth of a series of plans for making canals in the Pampean region\r\nfor the purpose of transporting grain in the area which the railway\r\ndid not seem able to serve economically. Not one of them was carried\r\nout, but the railways quickly enlarged their sphere of influence in\r\nthe interior. There is, however, a reminiscence of this pause in\r\ncolonization in what Argentinians call \"the parabolic tariffs.\" The\r\nArgentine railways practically, apart from cases of competition with\r\nrival lines, use proportional tariffs up to a distance of 218 miles,\r\nand degressive tariffs beyond that limit. In this way the railways have\r\nhelped in the conquest of the west. Degressive tariffs have certainly\r\nplayed a part in the spread of colonization during the years antecedent\r\nto 1912. They have helped to mask the inferiority of the new land to\r\nthe better land in the east.[115]\r\n\r\n     [115] J. Lopez Mañan, _El actual problema agrario_ (Buenos\r\n     Aires, 1912, Ministerio de agricultura, Dirección General de\r\n     agricultura y defensa agricola).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAP VI.--THE RAILWAYS.\r\n  _It is impossible to give the entire system. Only the main lines are\r\n  given. Of the narrow-gauge lines of the Pampean region only those which\r\n  connect the system of northern Argentina with Buenos Aires are given.\r\n  The map shows the double direction of the Pacific system from Villa\r\n  Mercedes, to Buenos Aires and Bahía Blanca. It gives only an imperfect\r\n  idea of the way in which the lines ending at the ports of the Paraná\r\n  and the Rio de la Plata (Santa Fé, Rosario, San Nicolas, Buenos Aires\r\n  and La Plata) overlap and cross each other._\r\n                                                       To face p. 226.]\r\n\r\nThe rise in the value of land and the advance of colonization led,\r\nat each of those crises of development which characterize the recent\r\nhistory of Argentina, to a multiplication of railway concessions\r\ngranted by the national Government and the various provincial\r\nauthorities. These have to be bought up by the leading companies, as\r\neach of them wanted to keep exclusive control of the region in which it\r\nhad established itself. This concentration could not be accomplished\r\nin a perfectly methodical way, and the various systems now overlap,\r\nwhich is not to the interest of the companies. Thus Villa Maria, on\r\nthe Central Argentine line from Rosario to Córdoba, is also served by\r\na line belonging to the Santa Fé railways and by a line of the Pacific\r\nCompany which puts it in communication with Buenos Aires. On the other\r\nhand, the Central Argentine penetrates to the very heart of the area of\r\nthe Pacific at Junin.\r\n\r\nHowever, competition between the various companies has had the\r\neffect of dividing the Pampean plain into three great spheres of\r\ninfluence. The first, in the north, is that of the Central Argentine\r\nand the Buenos Aires y Rosario line. In 1908 the Argentine Government\r\nofficially sanctioned the fusion of the two companies, though it had\r\nreally been accomplished a few years before. The second sphere, in\r\nthe south, is that of the Pacific, the attraction of which was the\r\nline from Buenos Aires to Villa Mercedes, and which in 1907 bought the\r\nline from Villa Mercedes to Mendoza and the Trans-Andean, a natural\r\ncontinuation of its system. Moreover, in 1904 the Pacific absorbed the\r\nline from Bahía Blanca to the north-west, which has been linked up\r\nonce more with its original system at Villa Mercedes. It thus has two\r\noutlets, to Buenos Aires and Bahía Blanca, and completely encloses the\r\nthird sphere with its branches. The third sphere, which comprises the\r\ncentre and south of the Pampean plain, is the domain of the Southern\r\nand Western Companies. In 1912 these two companies asked the Argentine\r\nGovernment to authorize them to amalgamate. Although they withdrew\r\ntheir proposal in 1914, in face of the conditions imposed upon them,\r\nthey are still closely associated. Part of the traffic of the western\r\nlines of the Western passes over Southern lines at Carbuë, and is\r\nshipped at the port Ingeniero White. At Buenos Aires also, and at La\r\nPlata, part of the Western Company's traffic in cereals and cattle uses\r\nthe premises of the Southern Company. The Western and the Southern,\r\njointly, bought in 1908, before it was finished, the narrow-gauge\r\nMidland of Buenos Aires line at Carbuë, which was to cross their sphere\r\nof influence. It was opened in 1911.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the transport of cereals in the life of the leading\r\nArgentine systems will be seen from the following figures. In\r\npercentages of the total of goods carried, both from the interior to\r\nthe ports and _vice versa_, the tonnage of exported cereals was:--\r\n\r\n  ---------------+--------+--------+--------+----------\r\n                 |  1913  |  1914  |  1916  | Average.\r\n  ---------------+--------+--------|--------|----------\r\n  Southern       |  31.0  |  34.3  |  32.5  |   32.6\r\n  Western        |  58.3  |  61.7  |  55.1  |   58.4\r\n  Pacific        |  29.0  |  41.8  |  33.8  |   35.0\r\n  Central        |  36.5  |  46.6  |  34.8  |   39.5\r\n  ---------------+--------+--------+--------+----------\r\n\r\nThe figures are rather less for the Southern, which covers an area\r\nthat has remained chiefly pastoral and, by means of its Rio Negro\r\nline, serves for part of the transport of cattle from Patagonia\r\n(cattle-transport on the Southern, average for the years 1913, 1914\r\nand 1916: 17.2 per cent. of the total tonnage, 19 per cent. of total\r\nreceipts; 1.4 per cent. of tonnage and 6.5 per cent. of receipts). They\r\nare higher for the Western, the only system that lies entirely in the\r\nPampean region and has no continuations beyond it, as the Pacific has\r\nto Mendoza and the Central to Tucumán.\r\n\r\nThe share of each company in the total traffic varies from year to year\r\naccording to the harvest. Of the four to ten million tons of cereals\r\ncarried every year, the greater part--about a third--falls to the\r\nCentral Argentine, and one-sixth to the Southern. The Central Argentine\r\ncarries the greater part of the maize and flax, the maize alone\r\nrepresenting 26 per cent. of the total tonnage carried by the line, and\r\nthe flax 5.6 per cent. Of the other lines the Western alone carries\r\nany appreciable quantity of maize, which comes from the Junin district\r\n(19 per cent. of its tonnage, but only 12 per cent. of its receipts,\r\nbecause of the slight distances the stuff is carried). The transport of\r\nwheat is about equally divided amongst the four leading lines, but the\r\nproportion of it to total traffic is highest in the case of the Western\r\n(34.4 per cent. of total traffic). The Southern is the chief carrier of\r\noats (9.8 per cent. of the total tonnage). The tonnage carried annually\r\nis particularly irregular in the case of the Central, on account of\r\nthe irregularity of the maize crops, and the Pacific, because its\r\nlines north-west of Buenos Aires serve a wheat-area that is exposed to\r\ndrought (wheat carried by the Pacific in 1913, 15.9 per cent. of the\r\ntotal tonnage; in 1914, 27.2 per cent.).\r\n\r\nThe clearing of the cereals gives the Argentine railways a delicate\r\nproblem in the organization of traffic. The crops of flax, wheat and\r\noats must be cleared in the four to six months following the harvest\r\n(December-January). The maize harvest, which is later, is also much\r\nslower; it lasts the whole of the autumn. Hence the removal of the\r\nmaize is spread over a long period, and sometimes the work of one year\r\nruns into that of the next. This gives the Central an advantage over\r\nthe other lines. The wool also must, on account of its great value, be\r\ntransferred to the ports speedily after the shearing; but this is only\r\na matter of about a hundred thousand tons.[116]\r\n\r\n     [116] The war and the difficulties of marine freightage have\r\n     lessened the seriousness of the problem of carrying goods\r\n     rapidly by rail in Argentina.\r\n\r\nExport, however, is by no means the one source of traffic on the\r\nArgentine railways. Transport of goods for home consumption is chiefly\r\na question of a large part of the wheat crop. Building materials\r\nalso--bricks, lime and stone--are an important item on the various\r\nlines which link Buenos Aires with the Sierra de Córdoba and the\r\nSierra de Tandil. In 1913 the Southern line carried 1,134,000 tons of\r\nminerals, including 997,000 tons of stone and 101,000 tons of lime\r\nfrom the Sierra de Tandil and 34,000 tons of salt from the salt-mines\r\nof Lavalle, between Bahía Blanca and the Colorado. In the same year,\r\nthe Pacific, Central Argentine, Central Córdoba and State railway\r\ncarried 880,000 tons of minerals (half being lime) from the Sierra\r\nde Córdoba.[117] All the timber carried on the lines of northern\r\nArgentina, except the _quebracho_ from the banks of the Paraná, is\r\nfor home use: sleepers, fence-posts, firewood and charcoal are the\r\nchief items on most of the lines in the scrub. The war has checked\r\nrailway construction and reduced the use of sleepers, but it has also\r\ndeprived Argentina of combustible minerals and increased the transport\r\nof firewood. Even on railways like the Pacific and Central Argentine,\r\nwhich have very few of their lines on the scrub, the tonnage of wood\r\ncarried is 6 per cent. of the whole (average for 1913, 1914 and 1916),\r\nand the proportion rises to 30 per cent. of the total tonnage on the\r\nCentral Córdoba. For several companies the sugars of Tucumán and the\r\nwines of Mendoza are an important element of their receipts, not so\r\nmuch on account of the tonnage as the high cost of freightage and the\r\ngreat distance to the centres of consumption in the Pampean region. The\r\ncarriage of wine and casks brings the Pacific 38.3 per cent. of its\r\nreceipts (1913-14-16). The transport of sugar on the Central Argentine\r\nin a normal year amounts to 5 per cent. of its receipts. On the Central\r\nCórdoba the tonnage of sugar-cane and sugar carried amounted in 1914,\r\na year of exceptional harvest, to 42 per cent. of the total tonnage,\r\nand was still 20 per cent. in 1916, a year of very poor crop. The\r\nsupplying of meat to the market of Buenos Aires and the Pampean area,\r\nwith its dense population, means a good deal of long-distance traffic\r\nin cattle; the refrigerators taking the better cattle of the adjoining\r\nregion for the foreign market, and the slaughter houses of Buenos Aires\r\nbeing forced to content themselves with inferior beasts reared in the\r\nprovinces and the adjoining districts.\r\n\r\n     [117] The transport of mineral stuff, apart from salt, has\r\n     been greatly reduced by the war. In 1916 it was only 637,000\r\n     tons for the Southern and 157,000 tons for the whole of the\r\n     lines of the Central Argentine, Pacific, Central Córdoba, and\r\n     State.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these currents of internal traffic has made\r\nitself felt in the organization of the Argentine system. It has\r\nmade it necessary for each system to have not only an outlet to an\r\nexporting town, but a direct connection with the chief centre of home\r\nconsumption, Buenos Aires. The narrow-gauge system, which until the\r\nend of the nineteenth century had been restricted to the northern half\r\nof Argentine territory, north of the latitude of Rosario, developed in\r\nthe province of Buenos Aires after 1900, and ventured to compete in\r\nthe carriage of cereals with the broad-gauge system (Company of the\r\nProvince of Buenos Aires and Provincial railway of La Plata). This\r\nsystem connected with the narrow-gauge lines of the north. The Central\r\nCórdoba, which had reached Rosario in 1912 and so had escaped the\r\nneed to transfer its export-traffic at Córdoba to the broad-gauge,\r\nbegan immediately afterwards to effect a direct communication with\r\nBuenos Aires (Central Córdoba, extension to Buenos Aires, opened in\r\n1913). The line from Rosario to Buenos Aires of the Province of Buenos\r\nAires Company also serves to carry trains of the Province of Santa Fé\r\nCompany, which is closely associated with it. The medium-gauge lines\r\nof Mesopotamia also have effected a communication with Buenos Aires\r\nby means of a ferry-boat that plies on the Paraná between Ibicuy and\r\nZarate, and by using a section of the Buenos Aires Central.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of narrow-gauge and medium-gauge lines seemed to be\r\nissuing in a complete fusion of their interests in 1913. The Argentine\r\nRailway Company got control of the lines of Entre Rios, Corrientes and\r\nthe Paraguay. It promoted the development and extension of the Central\r\nCórdoba, and it also had large interests in the French companies of the\r\nBuenos Aires and Santa Fé provinces. All the narrow-gauge lines would\r\nhave concentrated in its hands if it had been able to get the State\r\nrailway. The broad-gauge line from Rosario to Puerto Belgrano had, as\r\nits interest conflicted with those of the great broad-gauge English\r\nsystems, joined the narrow-gauge group engineered by the Argentine\r\nrailway. But the amalgamation attempted by the Argentine railways did\r\nnot succeed, and, after its failure, the companies it had temporarily\r\nbrought together resumed their independence.\r\n\r\nThe river-route of the Paraná has sometimes been an auxiliary, at other\r\ntimes a rival, of the railways.\r\n\r\nUntil the line from Buenos Aires to Rosario was opened in 1886, the\r\nnavigation of the Paraná was the only link between the system of\r\nnorthern Argentina and that of the Buenos Aires province. Before the\r\nline was completed, the company had established a service of boats on\r\nthe Paraná, and in this way it kept up a traffic in goods consigned to\r\nstations on the Central Argentine, to be transferred at Rosario. These\r\ncombinations of railway and river service disappeared when the line\r\nfrom Buenos Aires to Rosario was finished.\r\n\r\nIn regard to export traffic the railways have not attempted to compete\r\nwith the river anywhere where it is open to maritime navigation; they\r\nhave merely been concerned to connect with it. On the other hand, the\r\nrailway and the river are rivals for the home traffic and the traffic\r\nof the upper districts which sea-going boats do not reach. Before the\r\ntime of the railways the river had taken all the goods traffic, but had\r\ntolerated on its left bank a post-road between Santa Fé, Corrientes and\r\nAsunción. The railway still has the advantage over the river in regard\r\nto speed (in carrying passengers between Rosario and Buenos Aires, and\r\nlive cattle from the Chaco and the Paraguay for Buenos Aires or the\r\nsalting works of the lower Uruguay). Even in regard to certain kinds of\r\nheavy goods--_quebracho_ timber--the river has not secured a monopoly,\r\nand there is a good deal of transport by rail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE RIVER-ROUTES\r\n\r\n     The use of the river before steam navigation--Floods--The\r\n     river plain--The bed of the Paraná and its changes--The\r\n     estuary and its shoals--Maritime navigation--The boats on the\r\n     Paraná.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of the use of the river-routes of the Paraná and the\r\nParaguay is not of interest to Argentina alone. It affects the whole\r\nhistory of colonization in South America. The very name of the Rio de\r\nla Plata is a reminiscence of the anxieties of the early navigators who\r\nlanded there, chiefly in search of a route to the mineral districts of\r\nthe Andes [Plata = silver]. It is remarkable that the Amazon, which\r\nopens a more direct and better route to the Andes, was never used for\r\nreaching Peru. It was at the most, and only occasionally, used as a\r\nreturn-route, whereas expeditions to the Cordillera were organized on\r\nthe banks of the Paraná during the whole of the sixteenth century. The\r\nroutes linking the Paraná and the Paraguay with the tableland furrow\r\nthe whole plain of the Pampa and the Chaco, from the latitude of the\r\nestuary to about 16° S. lat. (expedition of Ñuflo de Chavez in 1557).\r\nAn especially close network starts from the river between 18° and 22°\r\nS. lat. and ends at Santa Cruz, the most northern centre established by\r\nthe Spaniards on the plain, at the foot of the Andes, as a consequence\r\nof the use of the Paraná.[118]\r\n\r\n     [118] There is still a certain amount of goods traffic in this\r\n     latitude between the river and the Santa Cruz district by the\r\n     Puerto Suarez and Puerto Pacheco tracks.\r\n\r\nSpanish colonization, however, did not succeed in making permanent\r\nsettlements on the Chaco. The Indians, who were masters of it, disputed\r\ntheir passage, and the only practicable route was the southernmost of\r\nthe roads to the tableland, south of the Rio Salado, which ends at the\r\nestuary. From this time onward the prosperity of Buenos Aires eclipsed\r\nthat of Asunción. The river ceased to be a great continental route.\r\n\r\nThe division of the Paraná between the Spanish and the Portuguese was a\r\ncheck upon the full development of the river-route. The Portuguese held\r\nthe upper part of its basin, which now belongs to Brazil. They expelled\r\nthe Spanish missionaries from the upper Paraná about the middle of\r\nthe seventeenth century, and made themselves masters of the Paraguay\r\nnorth of 20° S. lat. Their forts at Coimbre and Albuquerque prevented\r\nany from ascending. D'Azara insists that it would have been Spain's\r\ninterest to disarm these forts; it would have enabled them to go up the\r\nriver as far as the Spanish missions to the Mojos and the Chiquitos. On\r\ntheir side, the Portuguese only used the upper section of the river,\r\nwhere it is joined by the Paulist road north of the Coimbre, as a means\r\nof access to the gold mines of the Matto Grosso. Even now, although\r\nthe Paraná is open to every flag, the development of the river-route\r\nis not independent of political conditions. In making the railway from\r\nSaint Paul to Corumba, and so creating on its own territory a means of\r\ndirect communication with the upper Paraguay, Brazil diverts from the\r\nlower districts part of the traffic which ought normally to go there.\r\nAgain, the ports of southern Brazil and the lines which go to them try\r\nto attract to the Atlantic the produce of the basins of the Uruguay and\r\nthe upper Paraná, which would have followed the thread of the river\r\nto foster the trade of Buenos Aires if the frontiers had been fixed\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution the river-trade was confined to exchanges between\r\nthe Misiones and Paraguay on the one hand, and Buenos Aires and the\r\nAndean provinces on the other. After the extinction of the missions\r\nParaguay was the chief centre of traffic on the river. At the close of\r\nthe eighteenth century it had a fairly large population. According to\r\nD'Azara, it amounted to 97,000, and 47,000 for the area of the former\r\nMissions (Misiones), while Buenos Aires, Santa Fé, Entre Rios and\r\nCorrientes had not more than 103,000 inhabitants collectively. Paraguay\r\nexported tobacco, _maté_ and timber by the river. The Buenos Aires\r\nEstano received 800 tons of tobacco a year. The exports of _maté_ from\r\nParaguay to Peru, Chile and the interior provinces amounted to 1,725\r\ntons, and 2,250 tons went to Buenos Aires. The timber came mostly from\r\nthe Tebicuary, where the _angadas_ (loads of timber) were formed. The\r\nchief constructive sheds also were on the Tebicuary. Boats of twenty to\r\n200 tons were launched there; and they had armed boats, when they went\r\ndown the river, to detect ambushes of the Indians, who were masters of\r\nthe right bank north of Santa Fé.\r\n\r\nThe development of navigation on the Paraná during the first half of\r\nthe nineteenth century was checked by the disturbances and wars of the\r\nperiod of the emancipation and unification of Argentina. The river was\r\nblockaded several times and traffic interrupted. Only a few smuggling\r\nschooners succeeded in getting through the side branches, which the\r\nships stationed in the river could not watch. Robertson escaped the\r\nSpanish vessels in this way. The picture which D'Orbigny has given\r\nus of the life of the river belongs to the year 1827. At that time\r\nthe estuary was blockaded by the Brazilian fleet in the whole area of\r\nthe delta as far as San Pedro. Piracy was so rife, and the insecurity\r\nso great, on the Uruguay and the Paraná, that few ventured as far as\r\nBuenos Aires, the ships being linked in convoys. Up stream, Corrientes\r\nwas the limit of navigation. The dictator Francis closed the Paraguay,\r\nand even the small boats no longer sailed on the upper Paraná, along\r\nthe frontier of Paraguay. The Correntinos, who spoke _Guarani_, could\r\nmerely get permission at rare intervals to send a few boats up river.\r\nArmed boats convoyed these as far as Neembucu, and they returned with\r\nhides and _maté_. Corrientes thus became the market-centre of the upper\r\nriver and replaced Asunción in the trade. The flotilla on the Paraná\r\nincluded flat-bottomed barges, which were only used in coming down,\r\nand strong keeled ships--schooners, sloops and brigs--with their ropes\r\nmade of leather. Down stream there was a little more diversity in the\r\ntraffic. The island sent cargoes of firewood and charcoal to Santa Fé\r\nand Buenos Aires. The orchards of the delta provided Buenos Aires with\r\noranges and peaches. Hides for export were shipped at Goya and Santa\r\nFé. But the chief freight was lime from La Bajada, which was burned in\r\nthe kilns on the Barranca, at the outcrops of the beds of conchiferous\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CONFLUENCE OF THE YGUASSU AND THE PARANÁ.\r\n  _In the foreground is the left bank of the Yguassu, on Argentine\r\n  territory. The right bank is Brazilian territory. At the back, on the\r\n  right bank of the Paraná, is Paraguayan territory._\r\n  PLATE XX.                                            To face p. 236.]\r\n\r\nThe navigation was fairly easy, the journey from Corrientes to Buenos\r\nAires (675 miles) lasting, as a rule, from fifteen to twenty days.\r\nGoing up, the time was more irregular. They had to stop when there was\r\nno south wind, or a little progress was made by hauling (_silgar_).\r\nD'Orbigny took a month to travel up.[119] In 1822, before the war with\r\nBrazil, there were 651 boats entered at Buenos Aires for coasting trade\r\non the rivers and 1,035 at San Fernando or on the Tigre, the advance\r\nport of Buenos Aires. In 1833 Isabelle put at one thousand the number\r\nof vessels at work on the Paraná and the Uruguay.\r\n\r\n     [119] The local south winds which help the voyage upward below\r\n     Rosario may be due to the high temperature of the water of the\r\n     river; this also gives rise on the lower Paraná to thick fog\r\n     of which warning is given.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 Rosas forbade navigation on the river. There was then a double\r\nblockade checking the trade of Argentina. The Franco-British fleet\r\nclosed the Rio de la Plata and blockaded Buenos Aires, where the\r\nGovernment of Rosas was established. In addition, Rosas's troops on the\r\n_barranca_ of the right bank prevented any from going up the Paraná,\r\nand cut off the interior provinces from the rest of the world. The\r\ninjury then done to interests which were already fully self-conscious\r\nmay be gathered from the agitation provoked by the decision of France\r\nand England in 1845 to break the blockade of the river. A convoy was at\r\nonce organized at Montevideo, consisting of no less than ninety-eight\r\nships, of 6,900 tons in all (MacKann). It went up the Paraná under the\r\nprotection of war-ships, which removed the chains slung across it by\r\nRosas. The convoy dispersed up river as soon as it was out of range of\r\nRosas. But it had needed so great an effort that the attempt could not\r\nbe made again before the fall of Rosas.\r\n\r\nThe closing of the Paraná compelled a diversion of the trade of\r\nParaguay toward the south-east. It crossed the isthmus of Misiones,\r\nbetween the Paraná and the Uruguay, and passed down the Uruguay. At\r\nthis time the whole commercial activity of Paraguay was concentrated\r\nat Itapua, on the upper Paraná. The prosperity of the Uruguay was some\r\ncompensation for the misery that reigned on the Paraná. The populations\r\nof Paysandu and Montevideo greatly increased.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, at the fall of Rosas, the modern period began for the Paraná.\r\nThe river-population changed rapidly. It ceased to be exclusively\r\ncreole. Basques, and later Italians, had settled upon the Uruguay ten\r\nyears before, and they now spread along the Paraná. In 1850 MacKann\r\nfound fifty vessels, of 20 to 100 tons, belonging to Italians at\r\nSanta Fé. This wave of immigration coincided with the development of\r\nrelations between the Paraná and the port of Montevideo. From 1852 to\r\n1860 Buenos Aires was isolated, and it remained outside the economic\r\nlife of Argentina. Montevideo took its place. Urquiza's administration\r\nsought, in addition, to establish direct maritime communication between\r\nover-seas ports and the ports on the river: Gualeguy in Entre Rios, and\r\nRosario in Santa Fé. Under a system of preferential duties (1857-59),\r\nwhich reduced the burden on goods carried by the river, Rosario grew\r\nrapidly, and between 1853 and 1858 increased its population from\r\n4,000 to 22,700. The period from 1852 to 1860 was also the time when\r\nsteam-navigation was developing, and this doubled the value of the\r\nriver-route. From 1860 onward Buenos Aires was connected by regular\r\nservices of steamboats with Rosario, Santa Fé, Corrientes, Asunción\r\nand Cuyaba. On the upper Paraná goods (timber, tobacco and oranges)\r\nwere still carried by sailing boats between Corrientes and Apipé, where\r\nthey stopped at the commencement of the rapids. Steamboats did not sail\r\nup the rapids of Apipé until 1868.[120] From 1850 to 1860 there were\r\nrepeated explorations of the Salado and the Bermejo, as the interior\r\nprovinces hoped to be able to find a connection with the vivifying\r\nartery of the Paraná (voyage of Page on the Salado from Salta in 1855,\r\nand of Lavarello on the Bermejo in 1855 and 1863).\r\n\r\n     [120] According to Rengger, sailing ships sometimes succeeded\r\n     in crossing the Salto d'Apipé.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the entry of Buenos Aires into the Confederation re-established\r\nthe normal condition of free competition between Buenos Aires and\r\nRosario. From that time the life of the river reflects the advance of\r\ncolonization in the Pampean region. The Paraná became the highway for\r\nthe export of cereals.\r\n\r\nThe two rivers, of which the Rio de la Plata forms the common estuary,\r\ndiffer considerably in their features. The Uruguay has irregular\r\nfloods, especially in autumn (May) and at the end of the winter\r\n(August-October). Low water is in summer (January-February). Its basin\r\nbelongs to the temperate zone, and does not extend northward as far as\r\nthe area of tropical summer-rain. The Uruguay also differs from the\r\nParaná in its low capacity for transport and alluvial deposit. While\r\nthe Paraná has built up a vast deltaic plain, the Uruguay ends in an\r\nordinary estuary, with rocky or sandy bed and clear water. The estuary\r\nof the Uruguay is 130 miles long and five or six miles wide. The\r\neastern shore is rocky and broken. The Argentine shore is low. It is\r\nformed in the south by the deposits of the delta of the Paraná, while\r\nfurther north, from Gualeguacha to Concepción, the hills of Entre Rios\r\nare hidden behind a screen of flat islands covered with palms, formed\r\nby the stuff brought by the streams of Entre Rios. The river-floods are\r\nlost in the great sheet of the estuary. The tide in the estuary or a\r\nflood in the Paraná is enough to turn the current.\r\n\r\nMaritime navigation goes beyond the estuary and beyond Paysandu, as\r\nfar as the rapids which prevent further advance at Salto. The twin\r\ntowns of Concordia (right bank) and Salta (left bank) mark the limit\r\nof navigation on the inner course of the river. It begins again above\r\nthe falls, at Monte Caseros, from which the river-boats go to San Tomé\r\nand occasionally to Concepción. Small ships go higher, as far as Salto\r\nGrande in Misiones (27° 20' S. lat.).[121]\r\n\r\n     [121] At one time the boats on the upper Uruguay saved\r\n     transport by going from Salto to Arapehy, midway between Monte\r\n     Caseros and Concordia (see Isabelle).\r\n\r\nThe navigable system of the Paraná is four times as large. The first\r\nsurvey of the river was made about the middle of the nineteenth century\r\nby the British Navy. At the beginning of the twentieth century the\r\nArgentine Government took up the study of the bed and the peculiarities\r\nof the Paraná, and the Ministry of Public Works published a map, on\r\nthe scale 1:100,000, of the course of the river between Posadas and\r\nSan Pedro, at the beginning of the delta. A precise survey was made,\r\nand twenty-six fluvio-metrical scales were established, the zero of\r\nwhich represents mean low-water.[122] Transverse soundings were taken\r\nat equal distances of 670 and 1,000 feet, the distance being reduced\r\nto 160 and even 80 feet at critical points. Thanks to this work, the\r\nParaná is now, no doubt, the best known of all rivers of that size.\r\n\r\n     [122] It is as well to notice that the profile determined by\r\n     the altitude of the zero of these different scales, or the\r\n     low-water profile, is of a purely theoretical character. The\r\n     river is never at low-water over its whole course. The real\r\n     profile is always varied by slight movements of flood and ebb.\r\n\r\nIts output is estimated at 6,000 cubic metres a second at mean\r\nlow-water, in the latitude of Rosario, and 25,000 to 30,000 cubic\r\nmetres a second during flood at a height of six metres above\r\nlow-water.[123] Its features bear the mark of its tropical origin.\r\nThe tropical character is typical on the Paraguay, which is, by its\r\nsituation in the central South-American plain, the real continuation of\r\nthe lower Paraná. The slightness of the fall of the Paraguay, however,\r\nand the extent of the marshes over which it spreads in Brazil and\r\nParaguay, have the effect of regulating and retarding the flood, which\r\nonly attains its maximum at Asunción in May. The flood of the Paraguay\r\nextends the period of high water on the lower Paraná until the end of\r\nautumn. The upper Paraná has most of its basin in the tropical zone\r\nof summer rain. But its behaviour is also influenced by the spring\r\nor autumn rains of the southern part of the Brazilian tableland. Its\r\nfloods are sudden and violent. They reach a height of sixty or seventy\r\nfeet in the region of the confluence of the Yguassu. They sweep rapidly\r\ndown stream, and reach the lower Paraná before the flood of the\r\nParaguay, which they hold back.\r\n\r\n     [123] Observations of the sediment held in the water have been\r\n     made at Campana, 32 miles from the estuary. At this point\r\n     the Paraná only holds in suspension fine particles of clay,\r\n     but sand travels slowly along its bed. The weight of the\r\n     clay in suspension varies from 179 grammes per cubic metre\r\n     in March during the flood, to 42 grammes at low-water in\r\n     July. The stuff mostly comes from the Bermejo, which carries\r\n     5 kilogrammes of sediment per cubic metre. The load of the\r\n     Paraná is much heavier than that of the Uruguay, but far lower\r\n     than that of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nFrom Posadas the flood-waves reach Corrientes in five days (235 miles).\r\nFrom Corrientes they reach Paraná in eight days (380 miles), travelling\r\nabout two miles an hour. That is one-third the speed of the current, as\r\nthe flood is retarded, and more or less absorbed, by the ramifications\r\nof the broader bed in which it moves.\r\n\r\nAt Bajada Grande the lowest water is in September. The flood appears\r\nin December or January, though sometimes in October or November. The\r\nmaximum is in March or April. The rise is rapid at first, but it\r\ngradually moderates, and the level of the water is raised about one\r\nmetre per month during three months. It then sinks in corresponding\r\norder. The ebb is often interrupted in June, and sometimes as late\r\nas August, by a sudden leap upward of the curve, representing an\r\nascensional movement of the water three times as rapid as that of the\r\nmain flood (one metre in ten days). The level reached in this late\r\nflood is sometimes higher than that of the normal flood in April or\r\nMay. The range of the ordinary flood-movements is from ten to sixteen\r\nfeet. Exceptional floods rise to a height of twenty-three feet above\r\nthe low-water mark.\r\n\r\nThe curves established for the years 1908 to 1910 by the Argentine\r\nhydrographical service enable us to analyse the mechanism of the flood\r\nwith a good deal of confidence. The beginning of the flood at Bajada\r\nGrande in October corresponds to the first flood of the upper Paraná.\r\nDuring this first phase the curve of the Bajada is parallel (thirteen\r\ndays later) to that of Posadas. There is the same parallelism in\r\nNovember, December and January. If the summer rains are light on the\r\nupper Paraná, the flood is late on the lower Paraná, and the water is\r\nstill low there in December (0.20 below the low-water mark on December\r\n31, 1910). At the beginning of March, before the maximum of the flood,\r\nthe curve of Bajada Grande differs from the curve of Posadas. It is\r\nthe time when the flood of the lower river is caused by the rise of\r\nthe Paraguay. The secondary floods of June and July again have their\r\norigin in the upper Paraná, but, as they are added to the flood of\r\nthe Paraguay on the lower river, they reach a higher level there than\r\nat Posadas; the difference gradually disappears as the flood of the\r\nParaguay subsides. It is the addition of the late floods of the upper\r\nParaná to the flood of the Paraguay that causes on the lower river the\r\nabnormal floods that occur there at irregular intervals (in 1825, 1833,\r\n1858, 1878, 1905 and 1917).\r\n\r\nBelow the Bajada the height of the floods progressively declines. On\r\nthe estuary they are no longer perceptible; variations of level are\r\ndue entirely to the tides. In the channels of the delta of the Paraná\r\nthe tide does not reverse the current as it does in the estuary of the\r\nUruguay, but it causes a slight rise of the water; and this has been\r\nobserved sometimes, at very low water, as far as Rosario.\r\n\r\nIt is near Corpus, about forty miles above Posadas, that the upper\r\nParaná escapes from the restraint of the Brazilian tableland, which\r\nimprisons its valley, from the falls of the Guayra, in a deep fissure\r\nbetween lofty basalt cliffs. Below Posadas the river leaves the\r\nregion of hills and red earth. Below Corrientes it flows everywhere\r\nover its own alluvia. Even above Corrientes its form has surprising\r\ncharacteristics of youth. The precise survey done on its banks has\r\nbrought to light a very distinct break of its fall above Villa\r\nUrquiza, about 400 miles from Buenos Aires. The fall, which from\r\nCorrientes onward remains between sixty and forty millimetres per\r\nkilometre, sinks suddenly to thirteen over a stretch of twenty-five\r\nmiles, and then rises again to thirty to forty-five millimetres.[124]\r\nBelow Rosario the mean descent is twelve millimetres to the kilometre,\r\nbelow San Pedro only six.\r\n\r\n     [124] The district on the right bank of the Paraná, above\r\n     Santa Fé and Paraná, seems to be due to a recent subsidence.\r\n     The river is, on the other hand, compelled to effect active\r\n     erosion in crossing the high lands between Santa Fé and Buenos\r\n     Aires. It is curious that the break or fall at Villa Urquiza\r\n     occurs precisely above the bend of the Paraná. A less marked\r\n     break has been recognized further north, in the latitude of\r\n     Lavalle, above the Goya bend. It seems that the diminution in\r\n     the excavation of the valley is due to the erosion which the\r\n     current effects laterally on the cliffs of the left bank.\r\n\r\nAbove Corrientes the width of the main arm of the Paraná varies, as\r\na rule, from 2,600 to 6,500 feet. The width of the river-plain over\r\nwhich the floods spread is still more irregular. Between Santa Fé and\r\nParaná, where it is especially narrow, it is still ten miles wide.\r\nLower down it gradually broadens to a width of sixty-five miles at the\r\nhead of the estuary. The scenery is not the same in all sections of it.\r\nThe vegetation on the islands is richer and more varied up river, and\r\ntropical essences (laurel-timbo) are found below the Bajada, forming\r\nclumps of trees covered with creepers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE PARANÁ AT CORRIENTES.\r\n  _Banks and islands partially fixed by vegetation._\r\n                                               Photograph by Widmayer.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE _BARRANCA_ AT PARANÁ (ENTRE RIOS), LEFT BANK.\r\n  _It is composed of clays and of beds of conchiferous terrestrial\r\n  limestone, which have supplied the lime-kilns for more than a century._\r\n                                                   Photograph by Boote.\r\n  PLATE XXI.                                           To face p. 244.]\r\n\r\nBut the different scenes of the river region are most of all due to\r\ndifferent conditions of erosion and formation. Above Rosario the\r\nconfiguration is due to floods. Each succeeding flood alters it and\r\nleaves some trace of itself in the topography. The beds of sand that\r\nit lays down are fixed by rushes and floating weeds, then by willows\r\n(_Salix humboldtiana_). This screen of vegetation encourages accretion,\r\nand the edges tend to rise higher. In the middle of the island are low,\r\nmarshy lands. The irregularity of the alluvial deposits causes marked\r\nundulations in the whole region of the river, and everywhere gives rise\r\nto alternate beds of clay and sand. Below Rosario the river gradually\r\nloses its power. The islands become more stable and flatter. Clumps\r\nof willow and spiny _ceibos_ (_Erythrina cristagalli_) still cover\r\nthe edges of them, and sometimes spread over the interior. But as the\r\nclimate is now less humid, the vegetation fixes the soil less firmly,\r\nand the wind becomes the chief sculptor of the landscape. It heaps up\r\nthe sand during the low-water season, and makes dunes which rise above\r\nthe level of the greatest floods. These dunes form an unbroken line\r\nalong the land in the southern part of Entre Rios, in the north of the\r\nmain arm, with ridges at right angles, advancing toward the south,\r\nwhich rest upon the river clay; like the one which the Ibicuy railway\r\nfollows across the floodable area. The cattle of the district take\r\nrefuge on the dunes during floods. During periods of drought, on the\r\nother hand, they retain a quantity of water, and this is drawn from\r\nsurface-wells at their base.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the zone of the river are clearly marked on the whole\r\nof the lower Paraná. It is enclosed on both sides by high _barrancas_\r\n(cliffs), vertical in places where the main current washes their feet,\r\nbut sloping slightly where there is only a secondary arm with little\r\nerosive power. The cliff is broken only at the confluences of small\r\nvalleys, the flat, filled-up bottoms of which are on the level of the\r\nalluvial plain of the Paraná. The cliffs are at their highest in the\r\ndistrict of Villa Paraná, where they rise in places to a height of 300\r\nfeet. On the right bank the cliffs show a section of the upper layers\r\nof the Pampean clays. On the left bank there are æolian clays only at\r\nthe top of them. Below these are Tertiary marine strata (marls and\r\nsandstones with beds of shells). The cliffs of the left bank stretch\r\nnorthwards, with a few breaks, as far as Corrientes, and even into\r\nMisiones. Their height gradually diminishes, and the Tertiary marine\r\nstrata are replaced by granitic red sandstone.[125] On the right bank\r\nthe height of the cliffs gradually diminishes up river. They are still\r\nconspicuous at the confluence of the Carcaraña, but at Santa Fé they\r\nrise only about thirty-four feet. North of 31° S. lat., and for some\r\ndistance beyond Pilcomayo, the plain of the Chaco is very low, and it\r\nis impossible to define exactly the limit of the alluvial zone of the\r\nParaná. The fine clays, grey and white, which form the soil of the\r\nChaco, reach the left bank north of Corrientes, in the _esteros_ of\r\nNeembucu. The red sandstone hills of the Asunción district rise like an\r\narchipelago out of this level bed of lacustrine deposits.\r\n\r\n     [125] In the space between the frontier of Entre Rios and the\r\n     Rio Empedrado, south of Corrientes, the cliffs expose, above\r\n     the red sandstone, beds of sand and clay, fluvial alluvia\r\n     left by former beds of the Paraná, the traces of which can\r\n     be followed from the north-east to the south-west diagonally\r\n     across the province of Corrientes.\r\n\r\nThere is no obstacle to navigation in the entire stretch from Posadas\r\nto the falls of the Guayra on the Paraná and the Salto Grande on the\r\nYguassa. Sixteen miles below Posadas the Paraná passes through a series\r\nof graduated rapids for about sixty miles (1,467 kil. to 1,558 kil.\r\nfrom Buenos Aires) wrongly called the Salto de Apipé. The current then\r\nrises to a speed of eight knots, and the depth is three feet at low\r\nwater. These rapids are due to beds of melaphyre, which emerge amongst\r\nthe granitic sandstone, and the water makes its way between large rocky\r\nislands. At Ituzaingo (1,455 kil.) the current loses force. There is,\r\nhowever, still a rocky bottom lower down, for ninety miles, at a depth\r\nof five feet. Below this the rock only appears on the left bank, and in\r\na few ridges near the bank, or in isolated reefs which it has been easy\r\nto mark with buoys.\r\n\r\nFrom Corrientes to La Paz the river flows from north to south at\r\nthe feet of the Corrientes cliffs. These line the main stream\r\nbetween Corrientes and Empedrado, and for thirty-five miles south of\r\nBellavista. In the latitude of Riachucho, especially about Bellavista,\r\nthe cliffs form a series of creeks and capes, in which the west winds\r\ncreate a heavy sea that was dreaded by ships of light draught coming\r\ndown the river. North of Bellavista, and for more than a hundred miles\r\nsouth of Goya, the main stream is separated from the cliff by a series\r\nof alluvial islands; behind these are lateral arms (_riachos_) into\r\nwhich pour the rivers of Corrientes. These arms were much used by the\r\nearly navigators.\r\n\r\nBetween Esquina and La Paz the main bed, which is not in touch with the\r\nland on either of its banks, flows in a meandering path for some seven\r\nmiles, the scale of the bends being double that of the meandering of\r\nthe Paraguay north of the confluence. The islands are very small, and\r\nare strung in a rosary at the top of each bend. The depth is sixty feet\r\nat the top of the bend. The shallows are in a line with the islands at\r\nthe point where the current runs evenly again before the next curve.\r\nThe depth here is seven, and sometimes even five feet.[126] These\r\nshallows change their places quickly, and it is not always the same bad\r\nspot that determines the maximum draught for ships that are to be used\r\nin this section. This migration of the shallows is very different from\r\nthe permanence of the rocky bottom of the stretch between Corrientes\r\nand Posadas.\r\n\r\n     [126] In point of fact, the ridge is lower at the time of low\r\n     water, when the current is concentrated in the main channel,\r\n     so that one always finds one or two feet greater depth there\r\n     at low water than soundings taken at high water would lead one\r\n     to expect.\r\n\r\nFrom La Paz to Paraná the main course is outlined by the Entre Rios\r\ncliffs. There is no further meandering. The cliffs of hard rock offer\r\nfar more resistance than the soft alluvia over which the river wanders\r\nfreely. The permanence of the bed in front of the cliffs leads to\r\na depth of as much as eighty feet. Only here and there a fringe of\r\nalluvial stuff separates the channel for a time from the cliff. These\r\ncurves seem, as a rule, to coincide with the confluence of rivers,\r\nwhich bring a heavy load of clay from the tableland; as, does, for\r\ninstance, the San Feliciano, north of Hernandarias. They are marked\r\nby shallows, in strong contrast to the great depths of the straight\r\nsections. The San Feliciano _paso_, which is twelve feet broad to-day,\r\nwas only six feet broad in 1908. It appeared on Sullivan's map in\r\n1847.[127]\r\n\r\n     [127] A little above its actual position.\r\n\r\nBelow Paraná, as far as the estuary, the careful observations that\r\nhave been made since 1903 on the movement of the river have enabled us\r\nto learn some of its laws.[128] We can distinguish four sections of\r\nunequal length. From Paraná to Diamante the river remains in touch with\r\nthe cliffs of the left bank. It is not straight; it describes a series\r\nof linked crescents of equal radius, which seem to be traces of so many\r\nmeanders. Only one in two of the windings of the cliff is followed by\r\nthe channel. The wandering of the river is confined within limits as\r\nin a fixed mould. The Paracao shallow, which for a long time prevented\r\nships from reaching Santa Fé (gradually deepened by dredging from eight\r\nto nineteen feet between 1907 and 1911) is at the angle where two of\r\nthese curves meet. On the right bank the secondary arms continue to\r\nfollow the river (Paraná viejo, Riacho de Coronda).[129]\r\n\r\n     [128] In studying the variations of the bed of the Paraná it\r\n     is necessary to avoid comparing maps drawn at dates separated\r\n     by long intervals. The differences of such maps are such\r\n     that they do not enable us to follow the processes by which\r\n     the actual forms have been derived from earlier forms. The\r\n     analogies which they show are sometimes due, not to the\r\n     permanence of the topography, but to the return of a complete\r\n     cycle of changes, or of conditions analogous to the earlier\r\n     conditions.\r\n\r\n     [129] The secondary arms of the right bank, north of Santa\r\n     Fé, were not explored until 1870. Sullivan's map (1847) only\r\n     mentions the Riacho de San Jeronimo, which is visible for a\r\n     short distance below 20° S. lat. The right bank was the domain\r\n     of the Indians, and the Correntinos would not venture near it.\r\n     In 1870 ships began to use the San Javier arm, on which many\r\n     colonies arose. Further north the Paraná Mini has been used\r\n     since 1890 for exporting _quebracho_ timber.\r\n\r\nBelow Diamante the river leaves the cliff on the left bank and slants\r\nacross the alluvial plain to the cliff on the right bank, which it\r\nreaches at San Lorenzo. Over the whole of its thirty miles width it\r\nresumes the freedom and regularity of features which it had above La\r\nPaz. A comparison of the successive maps of the river shows that the\r\nscheme of its movements, which one would be tempted to draw up with a\r\nregular migration of the islands and loops down river, would not be\r\naccurate. The changes of the bed of the river are essentially due to\r\nvariations in the volume of the different arms, which are constantly\r\nchanging their size and adapting their shape to the body of water that\r\nflows in them. The radius of the curve of each arm is proportional\r\nto its volume. A long island is formed between two arms of equal\r\nsize which both describe symmetrical curves. If the volume of one of\r\nthem is reduced, its original curve is replaced by sinuosities of\r\nsmaller radius, and these nibble the edges of the island and give it\r\nan irregular shape. If the volume increases again, the winding bed is\r\nabandoned and becomes a dead bed, and a larger meander begins. The\r\ntrack followed by the ships then breaks up into a series of meanders\r\nover a course of about eight miles and a half, and this means the\r\nconcentration in a single channel of the greater part of the water of\r\nthe river, and in narrower bends in the sections where the current is\r\ndivided between several arms.\r\n\r\nFrom San Lorenzo to San Pedro the river flows by the cliff of the\r\nright bank. It is remarkably regular, and has only one slight bend:\r\nan exceptionally good site, on which the town of Rosario is built. At\r\nalmost equal intervals, differing by only about ten to thirteen miles,\r\nthe river leaves the cliff, and is separated from it by an alluvial\r\nstrand, or by an insular zone a few miles in width.[130] Below this\r\nbend the current again touches the cliff and landing is easy. The\r\nsmall, older ports of the Paraná--Constitución, San Nicolas, Puerto\r\nObligado and San Pedro--are built on similar sites. It does not seem\r\nthat the islands at the foot of the cliff tend to extend downward in\r\nfront of these ports; the points where the river reaches the cliff are\r\nfixed. The depth is often considerable at the foot of the cliff (138\r\nfeet opposite Puerto Obligado). The shoals are distributed irregularly\r\nat the bends, where the channel moves away from the cliff. They all\r\nhave to-day a minimum depth of twenty-one feet.[131] On the left bank\r\nthe secondary arms sprawl over the alluvial plain for thirty-five miles\r\nnorth of the river.\r\n\r\n     [130] As between La Paz and Paraná, it seems possible to show\r\n     some relation between these alluvial stretches at the foot\r\n     of the cliff and the confluence of the small valleys of the\r\n     Pampean plain.\r\n\r\n     [131] The Paso Paraguayo, which has cost the Argentine\r\n     hydrographic service most work, did not exist at the middle of\r\n     the nineteenth century. It seems that the channel then kept\r\n     to the cliff as far as Benavidez, and was continued as far as\r\n     the source of the Paraná Pavon by a very pronounced buckle, of\r\n     which the Monriel lagoon is a scar. In 1895 the Paso was only\r\n     fifteen feet deep.\r\n\r\nThe delta begins at San Pedro. The Paraná Guazu, or main arm, leaves\r\nthe cliff on the right bank and passes to the Uruguayan bank opposite\r\nCarmelo. The Paraná de las Palmas, which branches off from it to\r\nthe south and passes before Campana and Zarate at the foot of the\r\ntableland, is deep and easy to navigate, but it is closed at the bottom\r\nof the estuary by a six-foot bar, which makes it a sort of blind alley\r\nopened only above. The arms of the zone of the delta differ from those\r\nof the river-zone proper in the irregularity of their course. Flowing\r\nbetween long islands, they sometimes lie in straight stretches and at\r\nother times in meanders or almost perfect buckles. The channels of the\r\nsouthern part of the delta, near Buenos Aires, are called _caracoles_\r\n(snails) on account of their winding shape. The weakness of the\r\ncurrent, which is held up by the tide, is seen also in the distribution\r\nof the greater depths; they are no longer uniformly found along the\r\nconcave edge of the bends, but are scattered irregularly. On the Paraná\r\nGuazu a depth of 130 feet has been ascertained. Its minimum depth is\r\ntwenty-two feet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE PARANÁ ABOVE THE ESTUARY.\r\n  _Right bank. The river has moved away from the_ barranca, _leaving at\r\n  its foot an alluvial plain of imperfect spiral form_.\r\n  PLATE XXII.                                          To face p. 250.]\r\n\r\nThe study of the estuary may be taken separately from that of the\r\nriver. It consists of three parts, unequal in size, which open with\r\nincreasing breadth toward the Atlantic. The upper Rio de la Plata,\r\nabove Colonia and Puntá Lara, has a width of about thirty-five miles.\r\nThe middle Plata, twice as wide, extends to the latitude of Montevideo\r\nand Puntá de las Piedras. Then the outer harbour opens between\r\nMaldonado and Puntá Rasa. The water is still fresh in the middle\r\nestuary up to eighty miles below Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\nThe bottom is alluvial except in the channels between Martin Garcia and\r\nColonia.[132] Differently from up the river, where the channels have\r\nsandy bottoms, while the banks are of fine clay, the channels of the\r\nestuary have bottoms of mud and clay. In the outer harbour the pilots\r\nrecognize the approach of banks by the sand which is brought up by\r\nthe sounding-lead. The action of the waves, which is not found in the\r\nriver, accumulates stuff of comparatively large size and weight on the\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n     [132] The granite which outcrops at Martin Garcia also forms\r\n     the platform of the English Bank in the outer harbour.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the conclusions embodied in the nautical instructions,\r\nwhich describe the estuary as a theatre of rapid changes \"occasioned\r\nby the continual deposits of sand brought down by the Paraná and the\r\nUruguay,\"[133] the estuary is, as a matter of fact, in a remarkable\r\nstate of equilibrium, and there is no trace of a gradual accumulation\r\nof alluvia, or of important changes of channel. The shore of the\r\ndelta north of the Paraná de las Palmas, covered with rushes which\r\nprotect it from the attack of the waves, shows neither advance nor\r\nretreat. The broad lines of the hydrography of the Rio de la Plata\r\nare plainly indicated on Woodbine Parish's map. The English Navy map\r\nof 1869 (on the basis of observations in 1833, 1844 and 1856) only\r\ndiffers in detail from the present map. The stability of the channels\r\nis surprisingly different from the changes in the bed of the river\r\nin the flood-zone. The permanence of the bottom, in spite of the\r\nloose deposits of the estuary, is explained by the regularity of the\r\ncurrents. These currents, which determine the submarine topography of\r\nthe Rio de la Plata and the distribution of the banks, are not of river\r\norigin. They are tidal currents.\r\n\r\n     [133] The water in the estuary, worked up by waves and tide,\r\n     contains more sediment than the water of the river.\r\n\r\nThere are two groups of shoals in the estuary. The first, the Playa\r\nHonda, occupies the whole western part of it up to a line drawn from\r\nBuenos Aires to Colonia. These banks leave a narrow passage in the\r\nnorth, opposite the Uruguayan shore, and this is followed by ships\r\ngoing to Uruguay and the Paraná Guazu. The second group of shoals is\r\nthe Ortiz Bank, triangular in shape, which rests in the north on the\r\nUruguay coast below Colonia, while its point extends south-eastward to\r\neighteen miles north of the Puntá de las Piedras. It keeps the zone of\r\ndeepest water in the middle estuary to the south, near the Argentine\r\nshore. In the latitude of the point of the Ortiz Bank, on a line from\r\nMontevideo to Puntá de las Piedras, the middle estuary is separated\r\nfrom the outer harbour by a bar (_barra del Indio_) with thirty-eight\r\nfeet of water, caused by the transverse currents which circulate from\r\npoint to point inside the English Bank.\r\n\r\nThe tide in the estuary is very irregular. The south-east winds\r\nincrease the flow and retard the ebb. When they are blowing, it often\r\nhappens that the level of the water in the upper estuary keeps up from\r\none tide to the next, sometimes for several days. The tide, which\r\nis slight at Montevideo, is greater at the bottom of the harbour on\r\nthe Barra del Indio, sometimes rising nearly forty inches there. From\r\nthere it advances with difficulty northward, over the Ortiz Bank, along\r\nthe Uruguayan shore, whereas it passes freely into the deeper zone on\r\nthe Argentine side.[134] At Buenos Aires it still has a depth of thirty\r\ninches. From there it advances northward by the Martin Garcia channels\r\nbeyond the Playa Honda. The channel of the Pozos del Barca Grande,\r\nwhich crosses the Playa Honda bank from north to south, parallel to the\r\nedge of the delta, is oriented in conformity with the tidal currents\r\nand maintained by them. It is not attached to the river, and it is\r\nseparated from the mouths of the Paraná de las Palmas or the Paraná\r\nMini by shallows which are navigable only to small boats. The _Rias_\r\nof the Uruguay, where the tide raises the water twelve inches, forms\r\na sort of reservoir which, at the ebb, feeds a strong current round\r\nMartin Garcia and sweeps the channels there.\r\n\r\n     [134] The current at high tide is stronger than at low tide,\r\n     and it has shifted to the north-east the streams which find an\r\n     outlet on this side.\r\n\r\nThe work done for the improvement of the estuary includes the deepening\r\nto thirty feet of the Barra del Indio and the dredging of a straight\r\nchannel from that point to Buenos Aires. Steamers of large tonnage\r\ngoing up the Paraná leave this channel twenty-six miles east of Buenos\r\nAires, and turn north in order to pass east of Martin Garcia, and\r\nenter the river by the Paraná Guazu or the Paraná Bravo. Since 1901\r\nthe Argentine Government has considered a plan of opening a direct\r\nroute from Buenos Aires to the Paraná de las Palmas, either by cutting\r\nan artificial canal at the foot of the cliffs, across the Tigre\r\narchipelago, or by using the channel of the Pozos del Barca Grande and\r\ncutting the narrow bar which closes the Paraná de las Palmas below. If\r\nthis were done, the ports of the Paraná de las Palmas would have direct\r\naccess to the sea. Moreover, the new route from the Paraná to the\r\nAtlantic would be entirely within Argentine territory, out of range of\r\nthe Uruguayan shore, and Buenos Aires would become a necessary port of\r\ncall both on departure and return.\r\n\r\nAbove the estuary, the work for the improvement of the Paraná began\r\nin 1904 and 1905. Since 1910 the material dredged from the bed of the\r\nriver has risen to 3,500,000 cubic metres a year on the average. The\r\nexperience gained in the course of this work has enabled the Argentine\r\nhydrographic service to adjust its methods to the incomparable force\r\nof the river. It is impossible to maintain a general rectification of\r\nthe bed and the banks, as is possible with European rivers. The only\r\nthing to do is to submit quietly to the plan which the river sketches\r\nfor itself, and be content to deepen the difficult passages on the\r\nline of the main arm. Suction dredges, which work easily in the sand,\r\nattack each ridge or _paso_ from below, making a channel into which\r\nthe waters flow, so that it tends to enlarge itself up stream. The\r\ndredges are shifted from bank to bank according as the soundings tell\r\nof the formation of fresh obstacles to navigation. They were at first\r\nconcentrated below Rosario, where the Argentine Government had to carry\r\nout certain engagements contracted with the Port Company; then they\r\nwere scattered as far up as Santa Fé. The actual equipment suffices to\r\ncarry out the programme that had been drawn up--to maintain a depth of\r\ntwenty-one feet as far as Rosario and of nineteen feet as far as Santa\r\nFé.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAP VII.--ESTUARY OF THE RIO DE LA PLATA.\r\n  _The channels of the estuary are parallel to the direction of the\r\n  tidal currents, which account for their depth. Those which cross the\r\n  shoals of the Playa Honda, at the bottom of the estuary, finish as\r\n  no-thoroughfares, and do not give access to the southern arms of the\r\n  river. From Buenos Aires ships going up the river have to go round by\r\n  Martin Garcia and the mouths of the Paraná Guazu._\r\n                                                       To face p. 254.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the section above Santa Fé, the engineer Repossini advises\r\nthat, instead of adopting a programme of expensive dredging with\r\nuncertain results, they should first think of adjusting navigation to\r\nthe natural conditions, and they are such as would be considered very\r\nfavourable in Europe. The hydrographic service would, however, still\r\nhave two functions: in the first place, the topographical study of the\r\nriver and the constant placing of buoys, and, in the second place, the\r\nobservation of its behaviour and anticipation of variations of level.\r\nThe utility of the work of foreseeing floods, which has been carried on\r\nsince 1907, has been abundantly proved. It published a daily bulletin\r\nof forecasts, based upon observation of the pluviometric scales of\r\nthe upper river, which is equally valuable to the navigators and to\r\nbreeders in the floodable area. It enables the breeders to get their\r\ncattle into safety before the floods come. On the other hand, the ship\r\ncan, thanks to the bulletin, foretell what depth of water it will find\r\nat critical passages, and calculate exactly the load it can carry, and\r\nso complete its cargo lower down. The service of forecast of floods\r\nhas morally improved navigation on the Paraná by suppressing every\r\npossible pretext for wilful stranding, which had become a current form\r\nof speculation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNothing is more varied than the fleet which now serves the Paraná. It\r\nincludes tramps, and long, slim European ships, which load up with\r\ncereals and meat; large river boats, luxurious and light; barges\r\nand tugs, lighters and schooners, which have compensation for their\r\nslowness in their cheapness.\r\n\r\nAs regards navigation, the river is now divided into three sections.\r\nMaritime navigation ascends as far as Santa Fé. At Rosario and Santa Fé\r\nit goes right to the heart of the zone of cereals and to the fringe of\r\nthe forest area. The upper section, between Rosario and Santa Fé, is\r\nless safe than the lower section, and this is reflected in the cost of\r\nfreightage from Santa Fé.\r\n\r\nThe ports of the lower Paraná, between Santa Fé and Buenos Aires,\r\nmay be classed in three categories. The ports of the first group\r\nare built on low land that is liable to be flooded. Every year the\r\nfloods threaten their traffic. That is the character of Colastiné,\r\neast of Santa Fé, which specializes in shipping _quebracho_ timber,\r\nor Ibicuy, on the Paraná Pavon, in the south of the province of Entre\r\nRios, which, however, is protected by excellent works. The small ports\r\nof the _barranca_ of the southern bank, on the main river and on the\r\nParaná de las Palmas, form a second group. They ship meat (Campana and\r\nZarate) and cereals (San Nicolas and Villa Constitución), and they are\r\nadmirably adapted for this by their natural situation. Steamers come\r\nright up to the cliff without any need of special works on the shore.\r\nThe sacks of wheat are let into the ships down sloping gangways from\r\nstores excavated in the cliff or from wagons. None of these ports are\r\nequipped for receiving imports. The third group comprises ports with\r\ncomplete apparatus for both export and import. The chief of these is\r\nRosario. It was the increase of imports between 1850 and 1860 that\r\nstimulated its early progress. To-day the tonnage of the goods unloaded\r\nat Rosario is nearly one-half the tonnage of the cereals shipped there.\r\nYet, in spite of appearances, it is the imports that account mainly\r\nfor the busy life of its quays. The port company does the unloading\r\nitself, as well as the handling and storing of the goods imported, but\r\nit is content to receive dues on all exports within the area for which\r\nit has a monopoly. Only a small part of the cereals exported uses its\r\nelevators. A deep-water port, equipped like that at Rosario for import\r\nand export, has just been constructed at Santa Fé. Already it competes\r\nwith Colastiné for the export of _quebracho_. Its import trade is still\r\nsmall, as such trade requires large capital and a whole network of\r\nrelations with the adjoining country, and that is not the work of a day.\r\n\r\nThe second section of the river stretches from Santa Fé to Corrientes,\r\nand is continued up the Paraguay. The transport of _quebracho_ timber\r\nand tannic acid is the chief item of its trade. The maximum draught\r\nof the vessels it admits at normal low water is six feet. Some of the\r\nports on the left bank (Esquina, Goya) and all the ports on the right\r\nbank (Reconquista, Barranqueras, etc.) are at some distance from the\r\nmain bed, or lateral arms. The Chaco works have generally a flotilla\r\nof steamers and barges. It is the exporters of timber and extract\r\nof _quebracho_ to Europe who most strongly demand the deepening of\r\nthe bed of the Paraná above Santa Fé. Sailing ships share with the\r\nriver steamers the transport of the products of the Paraguay and of\r\nCorrientes (hides, tobacco and _maté_). The transport of oranges alone\r\nfrom San Antonio, Villeta, Pilar and Humaïta represents an item of tens\r\nof thousands of tons.\r\n\r\nThe third section of the river stretches from Corrientes to Posadas,\r\nand beyond. Sailing ships have disappeared from this section, as they\r\ncannot make the Apipé rapids. Steamers of four and a-half feet draught\r\nand 150 tons are now used on it, but they cannot proceed at low water.\r\nThey provide a direct service between Buenos Aires and Posadas, though\r\nthe service is not very economical, because it does not permit them to\r\nuse to the full the transport-capacity of the river below Corrientes.\r\nMost of the goods for Posadas are, therefore, trans-shipped at\r\nItuzaingo, below the rapids, or at Corrientes. The steamboat companies\r\nwhich serve Posadas are obliged, in order to secure the economical\r\ntransport of goods shipped on the upper Paraná, to maintain lines which\r\ngo up the Paraguay as far as Asunción, and take on at Corrientes the\r\ngoods that come from Posadas. Higher up, the falls of the Guayra and\r\nthe Yguassu set an impassable limit to the enterprise of Argentine\r\nvessels. Boats on the stretch above Yguassu on the Paraná feed the\r\nrailways of the Brazilian tableland. The traffic of the upper Paraná\r\nconsists chiefly of _maté_ from Misiones and cedar-planks from the\r\nPosadas saw-mills. Rafts of timber are stopped at Posadas and rarely\r\nfollow the river further.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine statistics of navigation are obscure. They confuse under\r\none heading the river-traffic between Posadas and Brazilian territory,\r\nor between Corrientes and the Paraguay, and the exports of the Pampean\r\nregion to Europe. It is difficult to get from them an idea of the real\r\ntraffic, or to distinguish the tonnage loaded or unloaded at each port\r\nfrom that which merely touches its quays in ships going up or coming\r\ndown the river. They credit a score of ports with a total tonnage of\r\n(entries and clearances together) more than 500,000 tons.\r\n\r\nAt all events, they do enable us to distinguish between ports\r\nexclusively devoted to river traffic and those with direct relations\r\nto oversea ports. Nearly all the boats destined for the Paraná touch\r\nat Buenos Aires, which remains the chief importing centre, on the way\r\nup, and unload there. They then go empty to Rosario, San Nicolas, or\r\nSanta Fé to take on a full cargo of cereals or timber, and set out down\r\nthe Paraná for Europe without calling at Buenos Aires. Clearances for\r\ninterior navigation at the port of Buenos Aires are far more numerous\r\nthan entries. From 1912 to 1914 Buenos Aires received on the average,\r\ncoming from interior ports, 1,750,000 tons, of which 1,635,000 were\r\ncargo. It cleared for the same ports ships totalling 3,275,000 tons, of\r\nwhich 1,580,000 were in ballast. The latter figure fairly represents\r\nthe tonnage of sea-going ships sent up river empty after discharging on\r\nthe quays of Buenos Aires. At Rosario, San Nicolas and San Pedro, on\r\nthe other hand, the tonnage of clearances for Argentine ports is much\r\nless than the tonnage of entries.[135] The total movement of goods at\r\nthe port of Rosario is 410,000 tons entries and 375,000 tons clearances\r\nfor interior navigation, and 1,100,000 tons entries and 1,824,000 tons\r\nclearances for navigation abroad.\r\n\r\n     [135] Movement of internal navigation at Rosario (average\r\n     1912-1914): entries, 1,108,000 tons, of which 690,000 in\r\n     ballast; clearances, 580,000 tons. At San Nicolas: entries,\r\n     400,000 tons, of which 440,000 in ballast; clearances, 4,000\r\n     tons. The difference between the entries and the clearances\r\n     represents ships starting straight for Europe.\r\n\r\nAccording to Repossini's calculations the tonnage of exports on the\r\nlower Paraná south of Santa Fé rose in 1910 to 4,000,000 or 4,500,000.\r\nThe imports, almost entirely confined to Rosario, were about a fourth\r\nof this figure. For the middle and upper Paraná, Repossini estimated\r\nthe volume of the traffic at 800,000 tons, of which _quebracho_ was\r\ntwo-fifths.\r\n\r\nThe navigation of the Paraná is one of the chief sources of the\r\nprosperity of Buenos Aires. Even if the development of the import\r\ntrade at Rosario or Santa Fé is partly at the expense of the capital,\r\nand the boats laden with cereals do not stop at its quays, still the\r\ncoasting traffic on the river is in great part meant for Buenos Aires.\r\nIn returning, rather than go empty, the boats take cargoes of European\r\nproducts bought from the Buenos Aires importers. By means of the Paraná\r\nthe import-trade sphere of influence of Buenos Aires reaches beyond the\r\nfrontiers of Argentina, as far as Paraguay and part of Brazil. Buenos\r\nAires is, moreover, the main centre for equipping the steamboats of the\r\nriver. Its capital dominates the Paraná. Lastly, the Paraná supplies it\r\nwith an export freight which must not be overlooked. It is at Buenos\r\nAires that the hides, tobacco and timber and extracts of _quebracho_\r\nfor oversea markets, shipped on schooners in the upper reaches of the\r\nriver which are impassable for steamers, are trans-shipped for abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE POPULATION\r\n\r\n     The distribution of the population--The streams of emigration\r\n     to the interior--Seasonal migrations--The historic towns--The\r\n     towns of the Pampean region--Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\n\r\nA large-scale chart of the mean density of the population for each\r\nprovince--like those which were published in the latest Argentine\r\nCensus-reports--has no geographical value for the west and north-west,\r\nwhere oases of slight extent are separated by vast desolate stretches,\r\ndeserted because of the lack of water. In the Pampean region, on the\r\nother hand, the population is distributed in a very regular manner, and\r\nthe mean densities calculated fairly represent the facts.\r\n\r\nTo the several types of exploitation, of which we have studied the\r\ndistribution on the Pampa, there correspond unequal densities of\r\npopulation. Cattle-breeding, for instance, requires only a thin\r\npopulation. The early pastoral colonization of the plain on the west\r\nof the Salado was carried out, between 1880 and 1890, with a very\r\nsmall number of workers. A large ranch of 400 square kilometres on the\r\nnorthern edge of the Pampa (the Tostado ranch) only employs about a\r\nhundred men, or one for four square kilometres. The density increases\r\nappreciably for sheep-breeding on the _pastos tiernos_ of Buenos Aires\r\nprovince, where a ranch of a hundred square kilometres, devoted to\r\nproducing wool, with fifty or sixty shepherds, sustains at least 200\r\npersons, or two to the square kilometre.[136] The density is not\r\nappreciably greater in the area of wheat-growing on a large scale,\r\nwhere the extent cultivated by one family reaches, including fallow,\r\n200 hectares. But it may, even apart from the urban population, be more\r\nthan ten to the square kilometre in the maize belt.\r\n\r\n     [136] The density is twenty times less in the ranches which\r\n     use the meagre pastures of the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the population of Argentina can be followed closely\r\nfrom the middle of the eighteenth century. A Census taken in 1774\r\ngives the Buenos Aires district within the first line of forts 6,000\r\ninhabitants. At the end of the eighteenth century (Census of 1797,\r\nquoted by D'Azara) the population of the province of Buenos Aires,\r\nwithout the town, was a little over 30,000 souls, the zone occupied\r\nhaving been extended in the meantime, at least in part, as far as the\r\nSalado. Woodbine Parish estimates the population at 80,000 in 1824, at\r\nthe time when the expansion southward, beyond the Salado, as far as the\r\nSierra de Tandil, began. It doubled between 1824 and 1855. The northern\r\ndepartments then counted 45,000 inhabitants, the western 58,000 and the\r\nsouthern 63,000. The density was still a little greater in the north,\r\nalong the road to Peru, but the advance of sheep-rearing in the south\r\nwas beginning to change the centre of gravity of colonization. The\r\nfirst regular Census of the Argentine Republic in 1869 showed a still\r\nmore rapid advance. The population of the Buenos Aires province had\r\ngrown to 315,000 inhabitants. The increase was greatest in the west,\r\nwhere tillage began to extend round Chivilcoy, beyond the pastoral\r\narea, and in the south, where sheep-farms multiplied. The population of\r\nthe southern departments more than doubled in fourteen years (137,000\r\ninhabitants to 70,000 square kilometres in occupation, or two to the\r\nsquare kilometre).\r\n\r\nHowever, the Pampean region--Buenos Aires (including the capital),\r\nSanta Fé, and the southern part of Córdoba--still had a smaller\r\npopulation than that of the northern and north-western provinces:\r\n626,000 as compared with 813,000. The Mesopotamian provinces had then\r\n263,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe proportion was reversed twenty-five years later at the 1895 Census.\r\nThe population of the Pampas had increased threefold, and was more than\r\na half of the entire population of the country. That of the western and\r\nnorth-western provinces was about a third of the whole, and had only\r\nincreased by fifty per cent.\r\n\r\nIf one considers in detail the distribution of the population of the\r\nPampean plain in 1895, one sees that beyond the suburbs of Buenos Aires\r\nthe area of greatest density--five to eight per square kilometre--was\r\nin the north-west, between San Andres de Giles and Pergamino, a\r\ndistrict of advanced methods, where the cultivation of maize was\r\nbeginning to occupy a good part of the land. The population was\r\nconfined to the west of the preceding zone, in the agricultural area of\r\nJunin, Chacabuco and Chivilcoy. This area, where maize and wheat were\r\nnext each other, already embraced Viente Cinco de Mayo (five to the\r\nsquare kilometre) on the west and Nueve de Julio (2.5). In the south\r\nof Buenos Aires, the departments of the left bank of the Salado, which\r\nwere entirely given up to breeding, but long colonized, had a density\r\nof three to five per square kilometre. The region lying between the\r\nlower Salado and the Sierra de Tandil, a sheep-breeding area, then\r\ngiving good returns but of recent colonization, had not more than\r\nthree. The density falls rapidly as one goes westward. It sinks to less\r\nthan one in the north-west and west of the Buenos Aires province, in\r\nthe area where the cattle-breeders from the east had settled. At Santa\r\nFé, the region of the colonies, at the level both of Rosario and Santa\r\nFé, had five inhabitants per square kilometre. But beyond the Córdoba\r\nfrontier the density falls to two in the San Justo department, and\r\nstill less further south, at Marcos Juarez, Union and General Lopez.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE OLDER INDUSTRIES OF THE PAMPA: DRYING HIDES.\r\n                        Photograph by Soc. Fotografica de Aficionados.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DRYING SALT MEAT.\r\n                         Photograph by Soc.

To face p. 262.]\r\n\r\nIn 1914 the density was more than fifteen in the whole of the maize\r\narea in the Buenos Aires and Santa Fé provinces, and it approached\r\nthis figure in the departments of the old agricultural colonies on the\r\nmiddle Salado. In the region of the lucerne farms it was three to five,\r\nexcept in the south-east (departments of Veinte Cinco de Mayo, Nueve\r\nde Julio and Bolivia), where it rose, thanks to the co-existence of\r\nranches and of wheat and maize. It sank to between two and three in the\r\nwheat area in the south and south-east of Buenos Aires. At Santa Fé the\r\ndistrict of the colonies had seven to the square kilometre.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the population is partly explained by immigration\r\nfrom Europe. Foreigners were, in 1914, 30 per cent. of the total\r\npopulation.[137] The proportion of foreigners to the total population\r\nis one of the indications by which we can best follow the advance\r\nof colonization. As soon as it relaxes in any region, the number of\r\nimmigrants diminishes. (The children born of foreign colonists in\r\nArgentina are considered indigenous in Argentine statistics.) In 1869\r\nthe proportion of foreigners rose to 417 per 1,000 in the province\r\nof Buenos Aires (without the capital). This was the great period\r\nof pastoral colonization and the development of sheep-breeding. It\r\nwas then only 156 per 1,000 at Santa Fé. In 1895 the proportion of\r\nforeigners sank to 309 per 1,000 at Buenos Aires, but rose to 419 at\r\nSanta Fé, where the date almost marks the end of the great period of\r\nagricultural colonization. In 1914 the proportion of foreigners at\r\nBuenos Aires rose to 340 per 1,000 (development of the maize region and\r\nthe southern wheat area). It sank at Santa Fé (350 per 1,000), in spite\r\nof considerable immigration in the southern maize-growing departments.\r\nAt the same time there was a great influx of foreign population in the\r\nprovince of Córdoba (200 per 1,000) and in the area of the Central\r\nPampa (360 per 1,000).[138]\r\n\r\n     [137] All Europeans, except a few tens of thousands of\r\n     Bolivians in the Salta and Jujuy provinces, a few thousand\r\n     Brazilians in Misiones, and a few thousand Chileans at Neuquen.\r\n\r\n     [138] I have referred elsewhere to the magnitude of the stream\r\n     of European immigration at Mendoza. In Patagonia (territory\r\n     of the Rio Negro, the Neuquen, the Chubut, the Santa Cruz,\r\n     and Tierra del Fuego, of which the total population is only\r\n     104,000) sheep-breeding has attracted a considerable number of\r\n     immigrants (428 foreigners per 1000 in 1914).\r\n\r\nThe recent enumerations also enable us to follow the displacements of\r\nthe indigenous population on Argentine territory and the part this\r\nhas had in colonization. Outside the Pampean region the parts of the\r\ncountry which have proved centres of attraction for the Argentine\r\npopulation are the sugar provinces of Tucumán and Jujuy and the\r\nprovince of Mendoza. In 1895 Tucumán had 40,000 inhabitants who had\r\nbeen born in other provinces, Jujuy 15,000 and Mendoza 19,000. The\r\nattraction of Tucumán was mainly felt in the adjoining province of\r\nSantiago (12,000 immigrants) and Catamarca (12,000). At Mendoza the\r\nimmigrants came mainly from San Juan (7,000) and San Luis (3,000).\r\nThe attraction of the timber region is more difficult to estimate,\r\nbecause most of the _obrajes_ are in the province of Santiago, which\r\nfound the workers itself, and the enumerations have not taken into\r\naccount displacements within each province. Nevertheless, immigration\r\ninto the land of the _quebracho Chaqueño_, along the Paraná, can be\r\nrecognised from 1895 onward. It was maintained by the Corrientes\r\nprovince. Santa Fé has 10,000 immigrants from Corrientes, of whom 6,500\r\nare in the forestry departments of Reconquista and Vera. The Chaco\r\nregion maintains 2,000 Corrientes wood-cutters and several hundred\r\nfrom Santiago and Salta. Corrientes has also sent 5,000 emigrants to\r\nMisiones.\r\n\r\nIn the Pampean region the population of Buenos Aires in 1895 included\r\nvery few who came from other provinces. The population of Santa Fé was\r\nmore mixed. The attraction of the agricultural colonies had brought\r\n65,000 Argentine immigrants. They came mainly from the left bank of\r\nthe Paraná and Córdoba. The immigrants from Córdoba are localized\r\nalong the railway from Rosario to Córdoba, in the Belgrano and Iriondo\r\ndepartments and the town of Rosario. The migration of the Santa Fé\r\ncolonists to the new lands in the west had scarcely begun at that time.\r\nThey were still only 3,000 in the Buenos Aires province, and 5,000 at\r\nCórdoba; most of them were in departments adjacent to the old colony\r\narea. The colonization of Córdoba began simultaneously in the east,\r\ntoward Santa Fé, and in the south-west, in the Rio Cuarto department,\r\nto which the breeders from San Luis went. Similarly, the Argentine\r\npopulation of the Central Pampa includes elements from the east as\r\nwell as European colonists and elements from the north-west (10,000\r\nimmigrants from the Buenos Aires province, 3,000 from San Luis).\r\n\r\nThe 1914 Census has less complete details in regard to interior\r\nimmigration than its predecessor. The migrations had not ceased.\r\nThe attraction of Tucumán and Mendoza had, in fact, decreased. The\r\nprovince of Tucumán had 55,000 Argentine immigrants, the province of\r\nJujuy 15,000, the province of Mendoza 34,000. The provinces of Mendoza\r\nand Corrientes remained nuclei of considerable immigration (38,000\r\nand 63,000 immigrants). At Santa Fé the number of emigrants who left\r\nthe province to settle at Córdoba and in the remainder of the Pampean\r\nregion rose from 14,000 to 87,000. The Patagonian territory also had a\r\nlarge excess of immigrants from other provinces.\r\n\r\nPeriodic migrations with no definitive change of residence are not\r\ngiven in the official statistics. The importance of these migrations in\r\nnorthern Argentina has been noted in the chapters we devoted to Tucumán\r\nand the forestry industry. They occur also in the Pampean region,\r\nwhere they are due chiefly to the need of labour for the harvest and\r\nthe threshing of wheat and flax, and for reaping the maize. Miatello\r\nhas given us a detailed analysis of the phenomenon for the province\r\nof Santa Fé in 1904. The period when the wheat and flax growers need\r\nhelp is from November to February. It begins in March for the maize\r\nfarmers, and lasts so much longer when the harvest is good. The\r\ntemporary immigrants come partly from Europe. Not only is the stream\r\nof immigration to Argentina fuller during the months which precede the\r\nharvests, while the stream of re-emigration to Europe is greatest in\r\nthe autumn, but it is not a rare thing for Italians to go every year\r\nto Argentina merely to stay there during the harvest, when wages are\r\nhigh. This seasonal immigration from Italy is of long standing; it is\r\nmentioned by Daireaux in 1889. These foreigners, however, are only\r\npart of the adventurous crowd enlisted for the harvests on the Pampean\r\nplain. Seasonal migration is everywhere a national practice. The labour\r\nemployed in reaping the maize includes elements borrowed from the towns\r\nnear the maize belt. But all the provinces round the Pampean region\r\nsend their contingent of temporary immigrants. Some even come from the\r\nvalley of the Rio Negro at Bahía Blanca, from San Luis, and even from\r\nMendoza to the Central Pampa and the Córdoba province.\r\n\r\nThe oldest, and still the largest, stream is that which comes from the\r\nSantiago province. D'Orbigny notices in 1827 the temporary streaming\r\nof Santiagueños to the coast. In that year slow progress was made with\r\nthe wheat-harvest of Buenos Aires because of the shortage of labour.\r\n\"The forced levies for the army prevented the Santiagueños from going\r\nto hire themselves, as was their custom, in fear lest they should be\r\ncompelled to serve.\"[139]\r\n\r\n     [139] D'Orbigny, _Voyage dans l'Amérique méridionale_, vol. i.\r\n     p. 528.\r\n\r\nTemporary emigration began, no doubt, with the journeys which\r\nbrought the northerners to Buenos Aires as drivers of convoys of\r\nwagons. Santiagueños were numerous amongst these _troperos_. Lorenzo\r\nFazio collected reminiscences of these journeys in the land of the\r\n_bañados_.[140] They go back to the first quarter of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the period before the diversion of the Rio Dulce and the ruin\r\nof Salavina and Atamisqui. \"My father,\" said one of his informants,\r\n\"drove wagons of wheat to Córdoba, and sometimes to Buenos Aires,\r\nwhere he sold them and bought goods-stuffs in exchange. He bought the\r\nwheat at Loreto, Atamisqui or Salavina. It was a year before he got\r\nback, because it was necessary to wait for the rain and the growth of\r\nthe vegetation, otherwise his animals would have died of thirst or\r\nhunger on the road.\" The journeys of the _troperos_ meant a long spell\r\nof idleness in the Pampean region, precisely at the harvest season.\r\nNaturally, they would lend a hand in it.\r\n\r\n     [140] Lorenzo Fazio, _Memoria descriptiva de la provincia de\r\n     Santiago del Estero_ (Buenos Aires, 1889).\r\n\r\nThe temporary emigration of the Santiagueños continued throughout the\r\nnineteenth century. It was maintained even during the disturbances\r\nunder the government of Rosas, which almost entirely put an end to\r\ncommercial relations between Buenos Aires and the northern provinces.\r\nWhen Galvez passed through the villages on the Rio Dulce he noticed\r\nthat there were few men in them. They had scattered over the roads or\r\nwere, as he says, _andariegos_. Only the women remained. The province\r\nof Buenos Aires received the Santiagueños in crowds, offering their\r\nservices. Chivilcoy and the whole region of the _chacras_ of maize and\r\nwheat received their caravans for the harvest, and some were kept for\r\nthe sowing. Even the ranchers took advantage of this reinforcement,\r\nand hired the men for marking. In the autumn they went back with their\r\n_tropillas_, much dreaded by the breeders whose land they crossed,\r\nstealing any horses that were not well guarded.\r\n\r\nThe province of Santa Fé, especially in the agricultural departments\r\nof the north-west, is now the chief theatre in the Pampean region\r\nfor the immigration of the Santiagueños. It does not always come by\r\nrail, but has to some extent preserved its primitive and picturesque\r\nfeatures. The immigrants arrive in troops on mules and horses, and\r\nscatter in November over the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe population of Argentina has also felt the attraction of the urban\r\ncentres. The growth of the towns is due to both foreign and national\r\nimmigration. The development of urban life, which is one of the\r\ncharacteristic features of modern Argentina, is a recent phenomenon.\r\nThere was no indication of its coming in the eighteenth century.\r\nD'Azara was, on the contrary, struck by the absence of communal life\r\n(_pueblos unidos_). The scattering of the population was a result\r\nof the predominance of breeding. \"If these people found profit in\r\nagriculture, one would see them gather together in villages, instead\r\nof the whole population being dispersed in ranches.\"[141] It is\r\nthis scattering of the population rather than an absolute numerical\r\ninferiority--the solitude, \"the desert, the universal horizon that\r\nforced itself into the very entrails of the land\"[142]--that moulded\r\nthe fiery soul of the _gaucho_.\r\n\r\n     [141] F. de Azara, _Memorias sobre el estado rural del río de\r\n     la Plata en 1801_, p. 10.\r\n\r\n     [142] Sarmiento, _El Facundo_, p. 19.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A HERD OF CREOLE CATTLE.\r\n                                               Photograph by Widmayer.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A HERD OF DURHAM CATTLE.\r\n                         Photograph by Soc.

To face p. 268.]\r\n\r\nThe primitive urban sites were all either on the river or on the\r\nhistoric roads to Chile and Peru. The only towns of the Paraná region\r\nat the end of the eighteenth century were Buenos Aires, Santa Fé and\r\nCorrientes. As to towns in the interior, Helms's journey in 1778\r\ngives us some idea of their size. Córdoba, at the crossing of the\r\nPeru road and the tracks to the province of La Rioja, had then 1,500\r\nwhite inhabitants and 4,000 blacks. As it was near the Sierra, which\r\nprovided granite and lime, it had some semblance of architecture, and\r\nhad paved streets, which struck even the traveller from Buenos Aires.\r\nThe attraction of its schools was felt over a wide area. We still have\r\na list of students from Paraguay who studied at Córdoba University in\r\nthe eighteenth century.[143] Tucumán and Salta, especially Salta, also\r\nwere busy centres. Salta had 600 Spanish families and 9,000 inhabitants\r\nin all, and its influence extended as far as Peru and Chile. Jujuy,\r\non the other hand, was a very small town. Helms mentions the decay of\r\nSantiago del Estero. The trade which had once flourished there had, he\r\nsays, gone in a different direction. The prosperity of Santiago was, as\r\na matter of fact, connected with traffic on the direct route from Santa\r\nFé to Tucumán, which ceased at the close of the eighteenth century.\r\nSanta Fé also was a decaying town at the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and would remain such until the middle of the nineteenth. Its\r\ndistress was due, not merely to the suspension of its direct trade\r\nwith Peru, but also to the decay and isolation of Paraguay, which had\r\nprovided most of its trade and for which it acted as intermediary with\r\nthe Andean provinces.\r\n\r\n     [143] Published by the _Revista del Instituto Paraguayo_\r\n     (vol. iv. p. 334).\r\n\r\nThe great development of urban life in Argentina dates from the time\r\nof the colonization of the Pampean region. The ratio of the urban\r\npopulation has risen considerably during the last twenty-five years.\r\nIn 1895, 113 centres with more than 2,000 inhabitants comprised 37 per\r\ncent. of the total population of Argentina; in 1914 the number of urban\r\ncentres was 322, and they comprised 53 per cent. of the population.\r\nThe population of towns with 5,000 to 20,000 inhabitants has increased\r\nthreefold in twenty years, rising from 312,000 in 1895 to 977,000 in\r\n1914. Large new towns like Rosario and Bahía Blanca were created. The\r\nrelative sizes of the older towns changed rapidly. Tucumán and Mendoza\r\n(121,000 and 92,000 inhabitants) shot beyond Santiago and Salta (22,000\r\nand 28,000 inhabitants). The towns of the north-west, Catamarca and\r\nRioja, are, on the other hand, scarcely developed.\r\n\r\nWhen one examines a chart of the urban population of the Pampean\r\nregion, one finds that colonization has led to the creation in it of\r\nten chief centres, of from 15,000 to 25,000 inhabitants, and some fifty\r\nsecondary centres, of from 5,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, which all\r\nhave a distinctly urban character. This association of urban centres\r\nand a scattered agricultural or pastoral population is one of the\r\noriginal features of the way in which the Pampa was peopled. There is\r\nno village, or purely rural group. The distribution of these centres\r\non the plain is fairly regular. They are a little closer together in\r\nthe districts near the Paraná, to the north of Buenos Aires, where\r\nthe population is older, and where the density, even of the rural\r\npopulation, is at its highest. The territory of the Pampa is divided\r\nbetween the spheres of influence of these various centres. Their radius\r\nis as low as ten miles in the north-west, and is about twenty miles in\r\nthe south of Buenos Aires and twenty-five in the extreme west.\r\n\r\nA secondary railway nucleus has generally settled the sites of them\r\n(San Francisco-Pergamino, Junin). Their population comprises all the\r\nworkers needed for the flow of the economic life of the Pampa: agents\r\nfor the exporters of cereals, merchants who supply the colonies\r\nwith imported goods--especially agricultural machinery--bankers and\r\ninsurance companies, surveyors and lawyers. Those which have the\r\nbest service of trains have a certain amount of industry--mills and\r\nbreweries--the products of which are absorbed locally. These towns\r\nderive all the elements of their life from the Pampean region itself,\r\nand have no direct relations either with foreign markets or with other\r\nparts of Argentina.[144]\r\n\r\n     [144] Only two of them, Villa Mercedes and Villa Maria, are on\r\n     the edge of the Pampa. We have seen elsewhere the part which\r\n     the extensive breeding of the north-west plays in the business\r\n     of the Villa Mercedes cattle-market. Villa Maria also derives\r\n     some advantage from its nearness to the scrub. Its limekilns\r\n     receive limestone from the Sierra de Córdoba, but they get\r\n     their fuel locally, from the men who clear the scrub.\r\n\r\nBut the towns of the Pampa which have grown most rapidly are the ports.\r\nRosario rose from 23,000 inhabitants in 1869 to 91,000 in 1895 and to\r\n245,000 in 1914; Bahía Blanca from 9,000 in 1895 to 62,000 in 1914. The\r\nactual population of the Pampa ports is not at all in proportion to the\r\npart which each plays in the export of Pampean products:--\r\n\r\n  _Export of Cereals in thousands of tons._ (Average for 1913-1915)\r\n     Buenos      Bahía       San  Nicolas.       La   Santa\r\n     Aires.    Blanca.  Rosario.             Plata.     Fé.\r\n      2,716      2,051     1,075       651      459     278\r\n                     Population in 1914.\r\n    245,000  1,575,000    62,000    19,000  137,000  64,000\r\n\r\nSome centres, such as Campana, Zarate, San Pedro or San Nicolas, which\r\nload up meat or grain in great quantities, have nevertheless remained\r\nsmall towns. Neither the trade in meat nor that in cereals is enough of\r\nitself to sustain a busy urban life. In point of fact, the growth of\r\nthe Pampa ports is mainly connected with their function as importing\r\nports and markets of capital. The close dependence of Bahía Blanca upon\r\nBuenos Aires in both these respects seems to forbid it all hope of ever\r\nbecoming the equal of Rosario. The prosperity of Rosario was founded\r\nduring the time when Buenos Aires was isolated, between 1853 and 1860;\r\nthis enabled them to organize an import trade there and to accumulate a\r\nnucleus of independent capital.[145]\r\n\r\n     [145] Buenos Aires and Rosario alone have independent grain\r\n     markets, though it is differently organized in each case. At\r\n     Buenos Aires the exporters have entered into direct relations\r\n     with the producers and eliminated intermediaries. At Rosario\r\n     they have to use the services of a strong body of agents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe development of Buenos Aires must be studied separately. It does\r\nnot merely reflect the success of the colonization of the Pampa; it is\r\na phenomenon of a national order. The attraction of Buenos Aires has\r\nbeen felt throughout the whole land. In 1895, of a total population\r\nof Argentine birth of 318,000 souls, more than a half--167,000--were\r\nborn in the provinces.[146] The way in which the prosperity of Buenos\r\nAires is bound up, not only with that of the adjacent territory but\r\nwith that of the whole country, is seen in the stability of the figure\r\nrepresenting the number of the inhabitants who have come from foreign\r\nlands. While the proportion of foreigners in each of the provinces\r\nvaries from one census to another, according to the displacements of\r\nthe stream of colonization, it remains almost the same at Buenos Aires:\r\n496 per 1,000 in 1869, 520 in 1895, 493 in 1914.\r\n\r\n     [146] The 1914 Census does not give reliable details on this\r\n     point.\r\n\r\nThe population of the city of Buenos Aires was estimated by Helms\r\nin 1788 to be between 24,000 and 30,000. D'Azara put it at 40,000\r\nin 1799. The Revolution did not interrupt its growth. According to\r\nthe estimate of Woodbine Parish the city had 81,000 inhabitants in\r\n1824. On the other hand, the Rosas Government involved a period of\r\nstagnation (90,000 inhabitants in 1855). But after 1855 Buenos Aires\r\nresumed its progress, even before the political unity of Argentina was\r\nre-established, and has never since relaxed. Its population has doubled\r\nalmost regularly at intervals of fifteen years: 177,000 in 1869,\r\n433,000 in 1887, 663,000 in 1895, and 1,575,000 in 1914. The latter\r\nfigure, in fact, is inadequate. Greater Buenos Aires, including the\r\noutlying parts, has really 1,990,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe site on which the city is built is a regular plateau, sixty-five\r\nfeet above sea level, cut by flat-bottomed, marshy valleys. The\r\nRiachuelo, at the mouth of one of these valleys, provided Buenos Aires\r\nwith its first port. The low and badly drained lands of the valleys are\r\noccupied by the poorest quarters. Their sides, the _barrancas_, bear\r\nthe aristocratic residences, and the gardeners have been able to use\r\nthe sites to great advantage in their plans.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the growth of Buenos Aires presents the same feature of\r\nregularity, on account of the uniformity of the soil, as the spread\r\nof colonization over the plain of the Pampas. The city is distributed\r\nin concentric zones, and it is thus a model on a small scale of the\r\ndistribution of the various types of exploitation on the Pampa which\r\nsurrounds it. The central nucleus, the business quarter, contains\r\nnot only the offices, but the warehouses of imported goods. Round\r\nthis centre, with a radius of one to three miles, are the residential\r\nquarters in which the density is greatest (250 to 350 to the hectare).\r\nBeyond this the density sinks to less than 200 per hectare and less\r\nthan fifty on the outskirts. The central quarters developed the maximum\r\ndensity after 1900. Those of the first outer zone have gained greatly\r\nbetween 1904 and 1909. Since the latter date, the progress of these\r\nquarters has been arrested in turn, and the recent growth is mainly in\r\nthe remote working-class suburbs in the south and on the bank of the\r\nRiachuelo.\r\n\r\nBuenos Aires has preserved in its central district, and reproduces\r\nin all its outer districts, the primitive draught-board plan of a\r\nSpanish colonial city. This plan is not suited to its needs to-day.\r\nThe rapid growth of the city and its expansion--the mean density is\r\nnot more than fifty-four inhabitants to the hectare, as against 360 at\r\nParis--complicate the problem of transport. At the present time the\r\ncity is considering plans for reconstructing its thoroughfares and\r\nmaking diagonal streets, starting from the centre and following the\r\ndirection of the main streams of traffic. In this way the city would\r\nreproduce the fan-wise distribution of railways over the Pampean plain.\r\n\r\nBuenos Aires is the intermediary between the provinces and oversea\r\ncountries. It has three titles to this profitable part. In the first\r\nplace, it is the chief centre of the import trade. The merchants of the\r\ncities in the interior are customers of the Buenos Aires importers,\r\nand are closely bound to them by a system of long-term credit. Buenos\r\nAires is, secondly, the centre for the distribution of the European\r\ncapital which has been used in the development of the country. Lastly,\r\nit divides immigrant workers amongst the provinces, just as it divides\r\ncapital. As an immigration port its position is unrivalled. The efforts\r\nthat were made to divert part of the immigrants to Bahía Blanca failed,\r\nand direct immigration to the Santa Fé province ceased at the close\r\nof the first period of colonization, about 1880. It is also at Buenos\r\nAires that immigrants who are not going to settle in Argentina embark;\r\nre-emigration, which is regarded as a national plague by Argentine\r\neconomists, is another source of profit to the capital. Hence the\r\nfortune of Buenos Aires is due in the first place to the close contact\r\nbetween the economic life of Argentina and that of Europe and North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nBut its very growth has led to a gradual change in the part it plays\r\nin the interior of the country. In proportion as its population and\r\nwealth grew, it became a great national market. The products of the\r\nprovinces go to it, not merely to meet its own needs as consumer, but\r\nin order to be distributed over the entire country. The figures of\r\nthe cattle trade on the Buenos Aires market are instructive in this\r\nrespect. From January to July 1919 there were 1,130,000 head of cattle\r\nsold, 240,000 being for the supply of the capital and 700,000 for the\r\nrefrigerators.[147] Of the remainder, 120,000 were bought for fattening\r\nand 40,000 by the butchers of other towns. The capital of its own which\r\nhas accumulated at Buenos Aires is invested either in real estate or in\r\nindustry, which has found great profit both in the development of local\r\nconsumption and in the great stock of labour provided by immigration.\r\nBuenos Aires is not now content to be merely an intermediary between\r\nthe country and foreign lands. It contributes by its own resources\r\nand work to the task of colonization and the supply of manufactured\r\narticles to the agricultural and pastoral districts. It is, finally, a\r\nluxurious city, with every opportunity for the men who have grown rich\r\nby the rise in the price of lands to spend their income, and providing\r\npleasure for the country folk who come up occasionally, tired of their\r\nlaborious, rough and solitary existence.\r\n\r\n     [147] During the same period the Argentinian refrigerators\r\n     killed 1,490,000 head of cattle. Therefore, about half of\r\n     these were bought at Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nI give here only the most important and most recent works. A list of\r\nthe articles I have consulted would be long and uninteresting, while\r\na complete list of those which might have been consulted, and from\r\nwhich information might have been gleaned, is impossible. For a work\r\nof this character there is no account of travel, no study of the soil,\r\nthe climate, or the vegetation, no statistical document or journal or\r\npurely historical text, that has not a perfect right to be regarded as\r\na source.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. PERIODICALS.\r\n\r\nOf the periodicals published in Argentina, and partly or wholly devoted\r\nto the study of the land and its development, the principal are:--\r\n\r\n_Boletin del Instituto Geografico Argentino_ (Buenos Aires, since 1879;\r\nvol. i, 1879, vol. ii, 1881; one vol. yearly from 1881 to 1901; has\r\nappeared irregularly since).\r\n\r\n_Anales de la Sociedad Cientifica Argentina_ (Buenos Aires, 2 vols,\r\nyearly from 1876).\r\n\r\n_Revista de la Sociedad Geografica Argentina_ (Buenos Aires, only\r\nappeared from 1883 to 1889).\r\n\r\n_Boletin de la Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Córdoba_ (Córdoba,\r\nsince 1874, 23 vols. to 1918).\r\n\r\nThe publications of the Buenos Aires and La Plata museums also contain,\r\nbesides copious anthropological, archæological, palæontological,\r\nand historical material, a large number of articles of interest to\r\ngeographers:--\r\n\r\n_Anales del Museo Nacional de Historia Natural de Buenos Aires._ Begins\r\n1864, 25 vols., folio and quarto, to 1914.\r\n\r\n_Anales del Museo de la Plata._ First series 1890-1900, second series\r\nfrom 1907.\r\n\r\n_Revista del Museo de la Plata._ From 1890-1891, 17 vols. to 1910-1911.\r\n\r\nAll these reviews contain especially articles on the parts of the\r\ncountry which were last explored--Patagonia, Chaco, Misiones. They\r\ncontain little about the parts that were early colonized, though these\r\nare not always the best known.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. MAPS.\r\n\r\nThe maps published in the eighteenth century (D'Anville's map, 1733, in\r\nthe _Lettres édifiantes_, 19th collection, Paris, 1734: Bellin's map in\r\nvol. ii of the _Histoire du Paraguay_ of the R.P.P.F.X. de Charlevoix,\r\nParis, 1756, 3 vols., etc.) are based upon information collected by the\r\nJesuit missionaries.\r\n\r\nD'Azara's map (1809) shows a remarkable advance.\r\n\r\nImportant corrections of D'Azara's map are found in Woodbine Parish's\r\nmap (1838).\r\n\r\nBrackebusch's two maps are essential documents: _Mapa del interior de\r\nla Republica Argentina_, por el Dr. L. Brackebusch, 1:1,000,000 (Gotha,\r\n1835) and _Mapa geologico del interior de la Republica Argentina_,\r\n1:1,000,000 (Gotha, 1890).\r\n\r\nThe results of earlier work have been used in the _Atlas de la\r\nRepublica Argentina construido y publicado por el Instituto Geografico\r\nArgentino_ (Buenos Aires, 1894), which includes a list of its sources.\r\n\r\nSince that date many maps have been published: maps of the various\r\nprovinces and surveys drawn up by the railway companies, the Chile\r\nFrontier Commission (see Patagonia), the Mines Division (see Natural\r\nRegions), and the Ministerio de Obras Publicas (see River Routes). A\r\nbrief account of the history of Argentine cartography and a list of\r\nmaps of provinces will be found in Colonel B. Garcia Aparicio, _La\r\ncarta de la Republica (Anuario del Instituto Geografico Militar_, i,\r\n1912, Buenos Aires, pp. 1-27).\r\n\r\nThe Military Geographical Institute has itself published a large number\r\nof maps, either on the basis of fresh surveys or by compiling earlier\r\nwork, chiefly:--\r\n\r\nAbout thirty sheets on the scale 1:25,000 (Pampean region) since 1904,\r\ninteresting for studying the relief of the plain.\r\n\r\n\"Governacion de la Pampa,\" 1:500,000 (Estado Mayor, 3A Division, Buenos\r\nAires, 1909).\r\n\r\nThree sheets on the scale 1:1,000,000 (Buenos Aires, Concordia, and\r\nCorrientes). Buenos Aires, provisional edition 1911 of a map of\r\nArgentina on the scale 1:1,000,000, which is to comprise twenty-one\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\nA convenient reference map, though of no scientific value, is the map\r\nof the railways, on the scale 1:2,000,000, in three sheets, published\r\nin 1910 by the Ministerio de Obras Publicas.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. STATISTICS.\r\n\r\nA summary of the chief statistics is published annually in _The\r\nArgentine Yearbook_ (from 1902 at Buenos Aires; from 1909 at Buenos\r\nAires and London).\r\n\r\nThe _Anuario de la Dirección General de Estadistica_, which has\r\nappeared since 1880 in one, two or three vols. quarto, gives the\r\nfigures of trade, immigration, agriculture, railways, navigation, etc.\r\n(last volume consulted is for 1914, Buenos Aires, 1915).\r\n\r\nIn the third volume of the _Anuario_ for 1912 will be found a list of\r\nthe publications of the Dirección de Estadistica. Besides the _Anuario_\r\nthe Dirección publishes a bulletin with commercial statistics (last\r\nnumber consulted 181, \"El comercio exterior Argentino en los primeros\r\ntrimestres de 1918 y 1919,\" Buenos Aires, 1919). _Boletin_ 176 contains\r\na review of Argentine trade from 1910 to 1917.\r\n\r\nThe statistical department of the Ministry of Agriculture, under the\r\ndirection of E. Lahitte, publishes the _Boletin Mensual de Estadistica\r\nAgricola_ (last volume consulted, xxi, 1919).\r\n\r\n\r\n4. GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS.[148]\r\n\r\n     [148] Besides the publications of the Jesuits, which can\r\n     easily be consulted, a fairly large number of texts bearing\r\n     upon the history of colonization have been published or\r\n     re-published in the nineteenth and the twentieth century. See\r\n     especially:\r\n\r\n     _Relaciones Geograpicas de Indias_ (vol. i, 1881; vol. ii,\r\n     1885, Madrid).\r\n\r\n     _Anales de la Biblioteca National, Buenos Aires, Publicación\r\n     de documentos relativos al Rio de la Plata_ (from 1900).\r\n\r\n     Publications of the _Junta de Historia y Numismatica\r\n     Americana_ (Buenos Aires, 7 vols., octavo, from 1905 to 1915).\r\n\r\n     Valuable notes on some of the most important historical\r\n     documents will be found in E. Boman, _Antiquités de la region\r\n     andine_ (see North-West Argentina).\r\n\r\n     The most curious collection of all for the geographer is:\r\n     Pedro de Angelis, _Colección de obras y documentos relativos\r\n     a la historia antigua y moderna de las provincias del Rio de\r\n     la Plata_ (Buenos Aires, 1837, 6 vols, octavo, containing many\r\n     itineraries, journals of expeditions, etc., together with\r\n     notes by D'Azara).\r\n\r\nThe scientific study of this part of South America may be traced back\r\nas far as D'Azara. His observations are collected in Don Felix de\r\nAzara, _Voyages dans l'Amérique méridionale_, published by Walckenaër\r\n(Paris, 1809, 4 vols. in 12^{mo} and atlas) and _Descripción e historia\r\ndel Paraguay y del Rio de la Plata_, published by D. Agustin de Azara\r\n(Madrid, 1847, 2 vols. octavo).\r\n\r\nThe _Voyage dans l'Amérique méridionale_ of Alcide d'Orbigny contains\r\nhis observations on the Paraná, the province of Corrientes, the Pampa\r\n(Parchappe's voyages), and Patagonia (1828). (Historical section, vol.\r\ni, Paris, 1835; vol. ii, Paris, 1839-43; vol. iii, third part, geology,\r\nParis, 1842).\r\n\r\nDarwin also visited the coast of Patagonia and crossed the Pampa\r\n(1833): _Narrative of the Surveying Voyage of H.M.S. \"Adventure\" and\r\n\"Beagle\"_ ... vol. iii, as _Journal_ and _Researches_ (London, 1839).\r\n\r\nSir Woodbine Parish's work, _Buenos Aires and the Provinces of the Rio\r\nde la Plata_ (London, 1838), is remarkably well-informed, and is based\r\nupon a thorough study of previous publications and archives.\r\n\r\nW. MacKann's _Ten Thousand Miles' Ride through the Argentine Republic_\r\n(London, 1855, 2 vols.) is interesting, and the work of a close\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nMartin de Moussy, _Description géographique et statistique de la\r\nConfédération argentine_ (Paris, 1858, 3 vols. octavo and atlas), is\r\nunequal, but full of information.\r\n\r\nThe work of H. Burmeister, _Description physique de la République\r\nargentine_ (Paris, 2 vols., 1876), is of little value, and has been\r\noverrated.\r\n\r\nRichard Napp, _Die Argentinische Republik_ (Buenos Aires, 1876, I vol.\r\noctavo), includes a valuable chapter by P. G. Lorentz on the flora\r\n(\"Vegetationsverhaeltnisse Argentiniens,\" pp. 87-149).\r\n\r\nThe second volume (\"Territoire\") of the _Second recensement de\r\nla République argentine_ (Buenos Aires, 1898) includes a joint\r\ngeographical study by a number of writers.\r\n\r\n_Géologie_, by J. Valentin.\r\n\r\n_Climat_, by G. G. Davis.\r\n\r\n_Flore_, by E. L. Holmberg.\r\n\r\nSome attempt at a general consideration of our geographical knowledge\r\nof Argentina has been made by E. A. S. Delachaux, \"Las regiones físicas\r\nde la Republica Argentina\" (_Rev. Mus. Plata_, xv, 1908, pp. 102-131).\r\n\r\nOur physical knowledge of Argentina has been greatly promoted by the\r\nwork of the Dirección de Minas. The results are summarized in the\r\n_Memorias de la Dirección general de Minas, Geologia, e Hidrologia_,\r\npublished from 1908 onward (_Anales del Ministerio de Agricultura,\r\nSección geologia, mineralogia, y mineria_: last volume published for\r\nthe year 1915, Buenos Aires, vol. xii, No. 2).\r\n\r\nSpecial works are published in the same section of the _Anales del Min.\r\nAgric._, and in the _Boletines de la Dirección de Minas, Geologia, e\r\nHidrologia_. See, especially, series B (Geologia). These reports and\r\nthe accompanying maps are the basis of all work on the geography of\r\nArgentina. They already cover a great deal of Argentine territory. The\r\nwork of Keidel, in particular, which is an essential contribution to\r\nthe geological history of the South-American continent, and that of\r\nWindhausen, are largely concerned with physical geography, the study of\r\nthe relief, and the influence of the climate on the landscape.\r\n\r\nA summary of the history of study of the soil of Argentina will be\r\nfound in E. Hermitte, _La geologia y mineria Argentina in 1914_\r\n(_Tercer Censo Nacional_, vol. vii, pp. 407-494).\r\n\r\nAs to climate: Buenos Aires Ministerio de Agricultura, _Servicio\r\nMeteorologico Argentino, Historia y Organisacion, con un resumen de los\r\nresultados_, preparado bajo la dirección de G. G. Davis (Buenos Aires,\r\n1914, quarto), dispenses one from consulting any previous works.\r\n\r\nThere is a very complete bibliography of works on the botany\r\nand geographical botany of Argentina in F. Kurtz, \"Essai d'une\r\nbibliographie botanique de l'Argentine\" (2nd edition, _Bol. Acad. Nac.\r\nCiencias Córdoba_, xx, 1915, pp. 369-467).\r\n\r\nThere is a convenient summary of our knowledge of the primitive\r\npopulation in Felix F. Outes and Carlos Bruch, _Los aborigenes de la\r\nRep. argentina_ (Buenos Aires, 1910).\r\n\r\n\r\n5. NORTH-WEST ARGENTINA.\r\n\r\nThe most complete general work on irrigation is that of E. A. Soldano,\r\n_La irrigación en la argentina_ (Buenos Aires, 1910, octavo). See also\r\nC. Wouters, \"La irrigación en el valle de Lerma\" (_An. Soc. Cient.\r\nArgentina_, lxvi, 1908, pp. 117-145).\r\n\r\nThe best description of the Puna de Atacama and the country of the\r\nValles is in Eric Boman, \"Antiquités de la région andine de la\r\nRepublique Argentine et du désert d'Atacama\" (_Mission scientifique\r\nG. de Crequi, Montfort, et E. Senechal de la Grange_, Paris, 1908, 2\r\nvols.).\r\n\r\nL. Brackebusch, \"Ueber die Bodensverhaeltnisse des nordwestlichen\r\nTeiles der Argentinischen Republik mit Bezugnahme auf die Vegetation\"\r\n(_Petermann's Mitteilungen_, 1893, p. 153) is a general description of\r\nthe whole of north-western Argentina; but Brackebusch's description\r\nof his journey, \"Viaje a la provincia de Jujuy\" (_Bol. Inst. Geog.\r\nArgent._, iv, 1883, pp. 9-17, 204-211, and 217-226) is fresher and more\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned in the note to p. 40 Bodenbender's work on the\r\nprovince of La Rioja.\r\n\r\nOf the various articles, from all quarters, on North-Western Argentina\r\nthe following may be noticed:--\r\n\r\nJ. B. Ambrosetti, \"Viaje a la Puna de Atacama de Salta a Caurchari\"\r\n(_Bol. Inst. Geog. Argent._, xxi, 1900, pp. 87-116).\r\n\r\nF. Kühn, \"Descripción del camino desde Rosario de Lerma hasta Cachi\"\r\n(_Bol. Inst. Geog. Argent._, xxiv, 1910, pp. 42-50).\r\n\r\nH. Seckt, \"Contribución al conocimiento de la vegetación del Nordeste\r\nde la Rep. Arg.--Valles de Calchaqui y Puna de Atacama\" (_An. Soc.\r\nCient. Arg._, lxxiv, 1912, pp. 185-225).\r\n\r\nJuan F. Barnabe, \"Informe sobre el distrito minero de Tinogasta\" (_An.\r\nMin. Agric., Seccion Geol. Mineralogia y Mineria_, x, No. 4, Buenos\r\nAires, 1915).\r\n\r\nOn the Puna de Atacama:\r\n\r\nL. Caplain, \"Informe sobre el estado de la mineria en el Territorio de\r\nlos Andes\" (_An. Min. Agric., Seccion Geol. Mineralogia y Mineria_,\r\nvii, No. 1, Buenos Aires, 1912).\r\n\r\nOn the sub-Andean chains:--\r\n\r\nGuido Bonarelli, \"Las Sierras subandinas del Alto y Aguaragüe y los\r\nyacimientos petroliferos del distrito minero de Tartagal\" (_ibid._,\r\nviii, No. 4, Buenos Aires, 1913). See also Dirección General de Minas,\r\nGeol., e Hidrol, _Boletin_, series B, No. 9 (Buenos Aires, 1914).\r\n\r\nOn the Chaco Salteño:--\r\n\r\nL. Arnaud, \"Expedición al Chaco\" (_Bol. Inst. Geog. Argent._, vi, 1885,\r\npp. 201-210).\r\n\r\nOn the part of the San Luis province that lies in the zone of the\r\nscrub:--\r\n\r\nAvé-Lallemant, \"Datos orograficos e hidrograficos sobre la Provincia\r\nde San Luis\" (_Bol. Inst. Geog. Argent._, v, 1884, pp. 191-196, and\r\n222-224), and \"Apuntes sobre represas y baldes en San Luis\" (_An. Soc.\r\nCient. Arg._, xi, 1881, pp. 178-188).\r\n\r\nA. L. Cravetti, \"Investigación agricola en la Provincia de San Luis\"\r\n(Buenos Aires, 1904, _An. Min. Agric._, Sección Agric., Botanica, y\r\nAgronomia, vol. i, No. 5).\r\n\r\nOn the scrub south of Mar Chiquita:--\r\n\r\nH. Frank, \"La repoblación forestal en la region de la Mar Chiquita\"\r\n(_Bol. Dep. gen. Agric. y Ganaderia_, Prov. Córdoba, ii, 1912, pp.\r\n52-57), and \"Contribución al conocimiento de la Mar Chiquita\" (_ibid._,\r\npp. 87-101).\r\n\r\n\r\n6. TUCUMÁN AND MENDOZA.\r\n\r\nOn Tucumán see Emilio Lahitte, _La industria azucarera, apuntes de\r\nactualidad_ (Buenos Aires, 1902).\r\n\r\nThe best source of the economic history of the sugar industry is the\r\nfile of the _Revista azucarera_ (\"organa de los cultivadores de caña y\r\nfabricantes de azucar,\" Buenos Aires).\r\n\r\nOn Mendoza, \"Investigación vinicola\" (Buenos Aires, 1903, _Anales_,\r\nMin. Agric., Sección Comercio, Industrias, y Economia, i, No. 1).\r\n\r\n7. FORESTRY INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nRudolf Leutgens, \"Beiträge zur Kenntniss des Quebracho-Gebietes in\r\nArgentinien und Paraguay\" (_Mitteil. Geogr. Ges. Hamburg_, xxv, 1911,\r\npp. 1-70).\r\n\r\n\r\n8. PATAGONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. The Tableland._\r\n\r\nApart from Villarino's journey on the Rio Negro in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the first journey across the Patagonian tableland is that of\r\nG. Chaworth Musters, _At Home with the Patagonians_ (London, 1871).\r\n\r\nIn the early volumes of the _Bol. Inst. Geog. Argent._ will be found\r\nthe results of various explorations between 1878 and 1885 by Argentine\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\nWith this group of documents, which provided the first material for\r\nhis conclusions, we may associate the geological studies of Florentino\r\nAmeghino, \"L'âge des formations sédimentaires de Patagonie\" (_An.\r\nSoc. Cient. Argentina_, l, 1900, pp. 109-130, 145-160, and 209-229;\r\nli, 1901, pp. 20-39 and 65-90; lii, 1901, pp. 189-197 and 244-250;\r\nliii, 1902, pp. 161-181, 220-249 and 282-342) and \"Les formations\r\nsédimentaires du crétacé supérieur et du tertiaire en Patagonie\" (_An.\r\nMus. Nac. Buenos Aires_, series ii, vol. viii, 1906, pp. 1-568).\r\n\r\nOn the southern part of Patagonia, south of 50° S. lat.:--\r\n\r\n_Svenska Expeditionen till Magellanslaenderna (Wissenschaftliche\r\nErgebnisse der Schwedischen Expedition nach den Magellans Laendern_,\r\n1895-1897, unter Leitung von Dr. Otto Nordenskjoeld, Band I, Geologie,\r\nGeographie und Anthropologie, Stockholm, 1907).\r\n\r\nOn the Magellan region and that of the Santa Cruz:--\r\n\r\n_Reports of the Princeton University Expeditions to Patagonia_, 1896-9,\r\ni, J. B. Hatcher, _Narrative of the Expeditions, Geography of Southern\r\nPatagonia_ (Princeton and Stuttgart, 1903).\r\n\r\nOn the Rio Negro district:--\r\n\r\nS. Roth, \"Apuntes sobre la Geologia y la Paleontologia de las\r\nTerritorios del Rio Negro y Neuquen\" (_Rev. Mus. Plata_, ix, 1899, pp.\r\n141-196).\r\n\r\nOf more recent works we must especially notice those of the engineers\r\nof the Dirección de Minas:--\r\n\r\nR. Stappenbeck y F. Reichert, \"Informe preliminar relativo a la parte\r\nsudeste del Territorio del Chubut\" (_An. Min. Agric._, Sección Geol.\r\nMineral., y Minas, vol. ix, No. 1, Buenos Aires, 1909).\r\n\r\nRicardo Wichmann, various studies of the eastern part of the plateau of\r\nthe Rio Negro (_ibid._, xiii, Nos. 1, 3 and 4, Buenos Aires, 1918 and\r\n1919).\r\n\r\nA. Windhausen, studies on the Rio Negro and the Neuquen (_ibid._, x,\r\nNo. 1, Buenos Aires, 1914). The geological results of Windhausen's work\r\nare summarized in articles that appeared in the _American Journal of\r\nScience_ (4th series, xlv, 1918, pp. 1-53) and in the _Bol. Acad. Nac.\r\nCiencias Córdoba_ (xxiii, 1918, pp. 97-128 and 319-364).\r\n\r\nWe must add G. Rivereto, \"La valle del Rio Negro\" (_Bol. Soc. Geologica\r\nItal._, xxxi, 1912, pp. 181-237, and xxxii, 1913, pp. 101-142).\r\n\r\n\r\n_B. The Andes._\r\n\r\nNumerous articles in the _Bol. Inst. Geog. Argent._ and the _An.\r\nSoc. Cient. Argentina_, immediately after the military expedition of\r\n1879-1880 (Host, Avé-Lallemant, etc.).\r\n\r\nA detailed study of the Andean region was undertaken at the time of\r\nthe frontier-quarrel between Argentina and Chile, and this led to a\r\nnumber of publications. The work done by the Argentinians under F. P.\r\nMoreno is used in _Frontera Argentina-Chilena, Memoria presentada al\r\ntribunal nombrado por el Gobernio de su Majestad Britanica_ (London,\r\n1902, 2 vols. quarto, 1 vol. maps, and 1 vol. photographs), and in the\r\n_Breve Replica a la memoria Chilena_ (London, 1 vol. quarto, 1902).\r\nSee a summary of the results in L. Gallois, \"Les Andes de Patagonie\"\r\n(_Annales de Géographie_, x, 1901, pp. 232-259).\r\n\r\nIn the _Revista_ and the _Anales_ of the La Plata Museum will be\r\nfound part of the research made during this period (1897-1900) by\r\nArgentine experts; especially the work of Burckhardt and Wehrli on\r\nthe Neuquen Cordillera. The Chilean work which served as the basis of\r\nthe _Statement presented on behalf of Chile in reply to the Argentine\r\nReport_ (London, 1902, 4 vols. and 2 vols. as appendices) is, on the\r\nwhole, less valuable.\r\n\r\nOf later travellers we must mention P. D. Quensel, \"On the\r\ninfluence of the Ice Age on the continental watershed of Patagonia\"\r\n(_Bull. Geol. Inst. Univ. Upsala_, ix, 1908-9, pp. 60-92), and\r\n\"Geologisch-petrographische studien in der Patagonischen Cordillera\"\r\n(_ibid._, xi, 1912, pp. 1-114).\r\n\r\nVery important surveys in the Cordillera and on the plateau of the\r\nRio Negro were made under the direction of Bailey Willis (_Northern\r\nPatagonia_, Ministry of Public Works, Bureau of Railways, Argentine\r\nRepublic; text and maps by the Comisión de Estudios hidrologicos,\r\nBailey Willis Director, 1911-1914, New York, 1914, 1 vol and atlas).\r\n\r\nOn the Patagonian forest (Argentine slope from 40° S. lat. to Cape\r\nHorn) see Max Rothkugel, _Los Bosques Patagonicos_ (Minist. Agric.,\r\nDirección Gen. Agric. y Defensa Agricola: Officina de Bosques y\r\nYerbales, Buenos Aires, 1916).\r\n\r\n\r\n9. THE PAMPEAN REGION.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of the western part of the Pampa between 1875 and 1880\r\nled to a fairly large amount of research. The most important work is\r\nthe _Informe oficial de la Comisión cientifica agregada al Estado Mayor\r\nGeneral de la Expedición al Rio Negro_, vol. iii, _Geologia_, by Dr.\r\nAd. Doering (Buenos Aires, 1882). We must also notice G. Avé-Lallemant,\r\n\"Excursión al Territorio indio del Sud\" (_Bol. Inst. Geogr. Argent._,\r\nii, 1881, pp. 41-49); D. Dupont, \"Notas geograficas sobre el païs de\r\nlos Ranqueles\" (_Bol. Inst. Geog. Argent._, 1790, pp. 47-56); and Est.\r\nZeballos, _Descripción amena de la Republica Argentina_, vol. i, _Viaje\r\nal païs de las Araucanos_ (Buenos Aires, 1881).\r\n\r\nOf general works on the Pampa and the Pampean deposits:\r\n\r\nFl. Ameghino, _La formación Pampeana_ (Paris and Buenos Aires, 1881),\r\nand \"Las formaciones sedimentarias de la región litoral de Mar del\r\nPlata y Chapalmalan\" (_An. Mus. Nac. Buenos Aires_, series ii, vol. x,\r\n1908, pp. 348-428).\r\n\r\nG. Bodenbender, \"La cuenca del valle del rio Primero en Córdoba:\r\nDescripción geologica del valle del rio Primero desde la Sierra de\r\nCórdoba hasta la Mar Chiquita\" (_Bol. Acad. Nac. Ciencias Córdoba_,\r\nxii, 1890, pp. 1-54); and \"Die Pampa Ebene in Osten der Sierra von\r\nCórdoba in Argentinien\" (_Petermann's Mitteilungen_, 1893, pp. 201-237\r\nand 258-264).\r\n\r\nSantiago Roth, \"Beobachtungen ueber Entstehung und Alter der\r\nPampasformationen in Argentinien\" (_Zeitschrift der Deutschen\r\nGeol. Ges._, xi, 1888, pp. 375-464); \"Beitrag zur Gliederung der\r\nSedimentablagerungen in Patagonien und der Pampas Region\" (_Neues\r\nJahrbuch für Min., Geol., und Paläont._, Beilage, Band xxvi, Stuttgart,\r\n1908, pp. 92-150); and \"La construcción de un Canal de Bahía Blanca a\r\nlas provincias andinas bajo el punto de vista hidrogeologico\" (_Rev.\r\nMuseo de la Plata_, xvi, 1909).\r\n\r\n_Nouvelles recherches sur la formation pampéenne et l'homme fossile de\r\nla Republique argentine._ A collection of scientific articles published\r\nby R. Lehmann-Nitsche (_Rev. Mus. Plata_, xiv, 1907, pp. 143-488),\r\nwhich contains, especially, one by C. Burckhardt, \"La formation\r\npampéenne de Buenos Aires et Santa Fé,\" and one by Ad. Doering, \"La\r\nformation pampéenne de Córdoba.\"\r\n\r\nAles Hrdlicka, _Early Man in South America_ (Smithsonian Institution,\r\nBull. 52, Washington, 1912--geological part by Bailey Willis).\r\n\r\nOn the district of the Central Pampa, R. Stappenbeck, \"Investigaciones\r\nhidrogeologicas de los valles de Chapalco y Quehuë y sus alrededores\"\r\n(Min. Agric., Dir. Gen. Minas, Geol., e Hidrol., Bol. No. 4, Buenos\r\nAires, 1913).\r\n\r\nOn various points in detail one may consult:--\r\n\r\nLavalle y Medici, \"Las nivelaciones de la Provincia\" (_Bol. Inst. Geog.\r\nArgent._, vii, 1866, pp. 57-71).\r\n\r\nP. A. Bovet, _El Problema de los Medanos en el Pais_ (Buenos Aires,\r\n1910).\r\n\r\nR. Velasco, \"Los Medanos de la Provincia de Córdoba\" (_Bol. Dep. Gen.\r\nAgric. y Ganaderia_, Prov. Córdoba, i, pp. 155-173).\r\n\r\nAmong descriptions of an economic character, which are generally of\r\npoor value, we must make an exception in favour of Emile Daireaux, _La\r\nvie et les moeurs à la Plata_ (Paris, 1889).\r\n\r\nA few useful notes on colonization will be found in Teod. Morsbah,\r\n\"Estudios economicos sobre el Sud de la Provincia de Buenos Aires\"\r\n(_Bol. Inst. Geog. Argent._, ix, 1888, pp. 143-151) and in E. Segui, \"La\r\nprovincia de Buenos Aires\" (_Bol. Inst. Geog. Argent._, xix, 1898, pp.\r\n419-440).\r\n\r\nA very useful summary of the results of a general inquiry into\r\nagriculture will be found in \"Investigación agricola en la Rep. argent.\"\r\n(_Anales Min. Agric. Agronomia_, vol. i, No. 1, 2 and 3, Buenos Aires,\r\n1904: \"Preliminares,\" by Carlos D. Girola, \"Investigación agricola en\r\nla region septentrional de la Provincia de Buenos Aires,\" by Ricardo J.\r\nHuergo, and \"Investigación agricola en la Provincia de Santa Fé,\" by\r\nHugo Miatello).\r\n\r\nWith this inquiry is associated G. D. Girola, _El cultivo del trigo en\r\nla provincia de Buenos Aires_ (Buenos Aires, 1904).\r\n\r\nAgricultural censuses have been taken repeatedly. For 1888 F. Latzina,\r\n_L'agriculture et le bétail dans la République argentine_ (Paris,\r\n1889). For 1895 (_Secundo censo_, see Population) the results are\r\ngiven in C. P. Salas, _Bureau central de Statistique de la province\r\nde Buenos Aires_ and _L'agriculture, l'élevage, et le commerce dans\r\nla province en 1895_ (La Plata, 1897; maps by Delachaux). For 1908,\r\n_Censo agro-pecuario nacional_. _La ganaderia y la agricultura en 1908_\r\n(Buenos Aires, 3 vols. quarto, 1909). Vol. iii contains a series of\r\nmonographs dealing not only with the Pampean region, but the economic\r\nhistory of the whole country.\r\n\r\nFor 1914 (_Tercer censo_, see Population) the publication of vol.\r\nv, relating to agriculture, is unfortunately delayed. There is also\r\navailable a census of cattle made in 1915 for the Buenos Aires\r\nprovince, _Provincia de Buenos Aires, Min. Obras Publicas, Censo\r\nGanadero_ (1916).\r\n\r\n\r\n10. THE RAILWAYS.\r\n\r\nFor the history of the railways see Rebuelto, \"Historia del desarollo\r\nde los ferrocarriles argentinas\" (_Bol. Obras Publicas_, vol. v, 1911,\r\npp. 113-172, vol. vi, 1913, pp. 1-48 and 81-110, and vol. viii, 1913,\r\npp. 1-32), and the entire series of the _Boletin de Obras Publicas_.\r\n\r\nA sort of annual of the Argentine railways has been published every\r\nyear since 1906 under the title _Killik's Argentine Railway Manual_\r\n(London, 1 vol. with map, last issue 1918).\r\n\r\n\r\n11. THE PARANÁ.\r\n\r\nE. A. S. Delachaux, \"Los problemas geograficos del territorio\r\nArgentino\" (_Rev. Univ. Buenos Aires_, 1906, v), includes a study of\r\nthe floods of the Paraná.\r\n\r\nThe chief source is the memoir of Repossini, \"Memoria sobre el rio\r\nParaná\" (_Bol. Obras Publicas_, vol. vi, 1912, pp. 141-168 and 254-264,\r\nvol. vii, 1912, pp. 31-48 and 163-186, and vol. viii, 1913, pp. 33-99).\r\nIt contains on a reduced scale the map issued by the Ministry of Public\r\nWorks, which is not available in France. The defect is supplied by the\r\nEnglish Admiralty Charts, \"Rio de la Plata,\" 1869 (No. 2544 in the\r\nCatalogue of Admiralty Charts), and \"River Paraná,\" parts i, ii, iii,\r\niv, v, and vi of 1905 (Nos. 1982/A and 1982/B).\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting economic summary in W. S. Barclay, \"The River\r\nParaná, an economic survey\" (_Geogr. Journal_, xxxiii, 1909, pp. 1-10).\r\n\r\nOn the estuary:--\r\n\r\nAlej. Foster, \"Regimen del Rio de la Plata y su corrección\" (_An. Soc.\r\nCient. Argent._, lii, 1901, pp. 209-234).\r\n\r\nG. Rovereto, \"Studi di geomorfologia argentina,\" ii, \"Il rio della\r\nPlata\" (_Bol. Soc. Geol. Ital._, xxx, 1911).\r\n\r\n\r\n12. POPULATION.\r\n\r\nBesides municipal and provincial censuses, there have been three\r\ngeneral censuses:\r\n\r\nFirst census made in 1869, one folio volume published in 1872. I have\r\nonly been able to consult _Oficina del Censo_. _Informe sobre la\r\noperación y resultado del Primer censo argentino_ (Buenos Aires, 1870,\r\noctavo).\r\n\r\nSecond census of the Argentine Republic, May 10, 1895 (2 vols, quarto,\r\nBuenos Aires, 1898).\r\n\r\n_Tercer Censo Nacional levantado el 1º de junio de 1914_ (10\r\nvols, quarto, Buenos Aires, 1916-1917). Only the fifth volume, on\r\nagriculture, is not yet to hand.\r\n\r\nA geographical interpretation of the distribution of the population\r\nwas attempted by E. A. S. Delachaux, \"La población de la Rep. Argent.\"\r\n(_Rev. Univ. Buenos Aires_, iii, 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abipones, the, 24\r\n\r\n  _Acequia_, the, 45, 69, 83\r\n\r\n  Aconcagua, 19, 38, 59, 70, 71\r\n\r\n  Æolian deposits, 21, 124, 170\r\n\r\n  Agricultural Centres Law, the, 202\r\n\r\n  _Aguadas_, 61, 210\r\n\r\n  _Algarrobas_, 39, 54, 64\r\n\r\n  Alhuampa, 113\r\n\r\n  Alumine, the, 128, 129\r\n\r\n  Ambrosetti, J.
