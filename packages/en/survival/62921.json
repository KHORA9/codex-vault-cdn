At this time some flowers and many\r\nimmature pods will be found on the plants, but the field will have a\r\nbrownish cast.\r\n\r\nSweet-clover seed pods shatter badly when mature. For this reason every\r\nprecaution should be taken to cut the plants at the proper stage and to\r\nsave as much of the shattered seed as possible.\r\n\r\nShattering may be reduced to a minimum by cutting the plants when they\r\nare damp from rain or dew.\r\n\r\nNo machine thus far placed on the market has given entire satisfaction\r\nin cutting sweet clover for seed.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary mower should not be used for harvesting the seed crop. The\r\nseed crop is usually cut with a self-rake reaper, grain binder, grain\r\nheader, or corn harvester. The self-rake reaper and the grain binder\r\nhave been most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe seed crop should be stacked unless it can be thrashed within two\r\nweeks after cutting.\r\n\r\nMuch shattered seed will be saved if a wagon with a tight floor is used\r\nfor hauling the plants. If the wagon bed is not tight it should be\r\ncovered with a tarpaulin or canvas.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be flailed from the plants, as is customary in the South,\r\nor it may be thrashed with a grain separator or clover huller, as is\r\nthe practice in the North.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary grain separator may be adjusted so that it will hull 90\r\nper cent of the seed.\r\n\r\nSweet-clover straw has considerable feeding value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER: HARVESTING AND THRASHING THE SEED CROP.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] This bulletin discusses only the harvesting and thrashing of the\r\nsweet-clover seed crop.

In localities where those species will\r\nproduce two cuttings the second year, either the first or the second\r\ncrop may be harvested for seed. As the plants die when mature, only one\r\ncutting will be obtained if the first crop is permitted to ripen. It is\r\nbecoming a general practice in many sections of the country to utilize\r\nthe first crop of the second season for pasture, ensilage, or hay, and\r\nthe second crop for seed. As a rule, this is the most profitable and\r\neconomical way to handle sweet clover, as the first crop will produce\r\nan abundance of nutritious pasturage or from 6 to 10 tons of ensilage\r\nor 1 to 3 tons of hay to the acre. The second crop seldom grows more\r\nthan 4 feet high when the first crop is pastured or cut. The shorter\r\ngrowth of the second crop is a very desirable feature, as it may be cut\r\nwith a grain binder without difficulty. When the first crop of white\r\nsweet clover is permitted to mature, the plants often make so large\r\na growth that it is very difficult to handle them with ordinary farm\r\nmachinery. This trouble is experienced more often in humid regions than\r\nin semiarid sections.\r\n\r\nAs biennial yellow sweet clover seldom grows as tall as the white\r\nspecies, little difficulty is experienced in cutting the first crop\r\nof the second year for seed with a grain binder. Annual yellow sweet\r\nclover, or sour clover, is seldom grown for seed, as a sufficient\r\nquantity to supply the market is obtained from the screenings of wheat\r\ngrown in the Southwest.\r\n\r\nSweet-clover seed ripens irregularly and shatters badly when mature. On\r\nthis account much seed is lost before and during harvest, and ordinary\r\nharvesting machinery has not been entirely satisfactory for handling\r\nthe crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME TO CUT THE SEED CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinions of extensive growers of sweet clover differ as to the proper\r\nstage at which to cut the seed crop. Some believe that it should be cut\r\nwhen the pods on the lower branches have turned dark brown to black,\r\nwhile others maintain that it is best to wait until the seed on the\r\nupper portions of the plants is mature. The time of cutting the seed\r\ncrop should be governed largely by the machinery which is to be used.\r\nIf the plants are to be harvested with a self-rake reaper or a grain\r\nbinder, they should be cut when approximately three-fourths of the\r\nseed pods have turned dark brown to black. At this time some flowers\r\nand many immature pods will be found on the plants, but the field will\r\nhave a brownish cast. If the crop is not cut until the seed pods on the\r\nuppermost branches have matured, most of the pods on the lower branches\r\nwill have shattered.\r\n\r\nIt is the practice in regions where a grain header is employed to\r\npermit the plants to become somewhat more mature before cutting the\r\nseed crop than in sections where other machines are used. More seed\r\nis shattered when the plants are cut at the latter stage, but this is\r\nnot necessarily a loss, as the grain header is employed for the most\r\npart in semiarid regions, where the shattered seed is depended upon to\r\nreseed the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF SEED FROM SHATTERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom one-fifth to three-fourths of the total seed yield of sweet clover\r\nis lost from shattering. The percentage of the loss which occurs before\r\nharvesting will depend largely on the time the crop is cut. Much seed\r\nmay be lost if harvesting is delayed for only a few days, and many\r\nfields have been observed in which at least 90 per cent of the seed had\r\nshattered in less then two weeks after the time the plants should have\r\nbeen cut.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of seed which is lost in harvesting will depend largely\r\nupon the manner of handling the crop. The binder or header may be\r\nequipped at a small cost, so that much of the seed which ordinarily is\r\nlost while cutting may be saved. Much shattered seed will be saved by\r\nusing wagons with tight platforms or platforms covered with canvas. All\r\nunnecessary handling should be avoided.\r\n\r\nShattering may be reduced to a minimum by cutting the plants when they\r\nare damp from rain or dew. It is the practice in some regions to cut in\r\nthe early morning or late evening, but this procedure will apply only\r\nto small acreages, since it is necessary to cut the crop as soon as\r\npossible when it reaches the proper stage for harvesting. It is a good\r\npractice to cut sweet clover at night, as the plants usually are damp\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINERY USED FOR HARVESTING THE SEED CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo machine thus far manufactured has given entire satisfaction for\r\ncutting the sweet-clover seed crop. On account of the ease with which\r\nthe pods shatter, it is a question whether any machine can be devised\r\nwhich will handle this crop without the loss of some seed. It is\r\npossible and practicable, however, for farmers at a small cost to equip\r\ntheir binders with pans and guards, so as to save most of the seed\r\nwhich otherwise would be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY MOWER.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary mowing machine is one of the most unsatisfactory devices\r\nused for harvesting this crop, as the subsequent handling necessary\r\nto place the plants in windrows or cocks causes much of the seed to\r\nshatter. The use of this machine for this purpose should be avoided\r\nwhenever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SELF-RAKE REAPER.\r\n\r\nThe self-rake reaper is one of the most efficient machines employed to\r\ncut sweet clover for seed. (Fig. 1.) This machine deposits the newly\r\ncut plants with the tops all turned one way in gavels or bunches at the\r\nside, so that the horses do not trample them on the next round. A high\r\nstubble also may be left, thereby reducing the weight and bulk of the\r\nplants which must be hauled to the thrashing machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--A self-rake reaper used in some sections of the\r\ncountry for cutting the sweet-clover seed crop.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--A sled used in western Kansas for hauling sweet\r\nclover from the field to the thrashing machine.]\r\n\r\nIt is the custom in some localities to leave the gavels to cure as\r\ndropped by the reaper on the ground, while in other sections they are\r\nplaced in cocks that weigh about 300 pounds each when cured. If the\r\ngavels are to be placed in cocks, this should be done immediately after\r\ncutting, as the plants will be somewhat green and tough at this time\r\nand fewer pods will shatter than when the plants are permitted to dry\r\nbefore handling. When the crop is to be hauled to the thrashing machine\r\non wagons it is best to permit the gavels to cure as dropped by the\r\nreaper, as it will then be possible to pitch them on the wagon with\r\na large 4-tined fork. If the crop is to be hauled to the thrashing\r\nmachine on large sleds, which is the practice in western Kansas, less\r\nseed will be lost from shattering if the gavels at the time of cutting\r\nare placed in cocks of such a size that they may be put on the sleds\r\nentire by two men lifting from opposite sides of the cock with 4-tined\r\nforks. The sleds used for this purpose usually are 12 by 20 foot in\r\nsize, made of matched flooring and with 6 to 12 inch sides. (Fig. 2.)\r\nMatched or tight floors are necessary, so that all seed which shatters\r\nmay be saved. These would not be so essential, however, if the sleds\r\nwere covered with a tarpaulin or canvas. From the standpoint of saving\r\nshattered seed, this method of hauling the crop from the field to the\r\nthrashing machine is possibly the most economical thus far used. It\r\nis estimated that at times as much as one-third of the seed yield is\r\ncollected from the floors of the sleds. It would be a good plan to\r\nreplace the runners of the sleds with very low trucks, as this would\r\nlighten the draft considerably.\r\n\r\nWhen sweet clover is cut with a self-rake reaper the crop is thrashed\r\ndirectly from the field. From 7 to 10 days of good haying weather in\r\nsufficient to cure the plants in the gavel or cock. Thrashing should\r\nbe done as soon as possible, much seed is shattered by rains and\r\nwinds. While a self-rake reaper is used to some extent in different\r\nsections of the country, it is used most extensively in the western\r\nNorth-Central States, and especially in western Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAIN BINDER.\r\n\r\nA grain binder is employed extensively for cutting the sweet-clover\r\nseed crop. (Fig. 3.) The general use of this machine in many sections\r\nof the country is due to the fact that it is found on most farms\r\nand therefore causes no outlay of money, rather than because of its\r\nefficient work. It is not so efficient as the self-rake reaper unless\r\nit is equipped with pans and guards to save the seed which shatters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Cutting sweet clover for seed with a grain\r\nbinder.]\r\n\r\nIt is possible to equip the grain binder with pans and extensions to\r\nthe rear elevator plate and binder deck, so that at least 95 per cent\r\nof the seed which shatters when the crop is cut may be saved. Those\r\npans and extensions may be made out of ordinary galvanized metal and\r\nstrap iron. The galvanized metal may be purchased at any tin shop or\r\nhardware store, and if sufficient strips of iron can not be found\r\naround the farm for this purpose strap iron may be purchased at any\r\nblacksmith shop. The material for those pans and extensions should not\r\ncost more than $4.50 or $5, and it should be possible to have them\r\nmade complete for $8 or $10, including material. Unless there are a\r\nforge and drill on the farm it will be necessary to have the braces\r\nand supports for the pans made at a blacksmith shop. The strap iron\r\nused in connection with the pans may vary in size, but for the most\r\npart it need not be heavier than one-eighth inch in thickness, and\r\nseven-eighths inch in width. The supports for the pan under the binder\r\ndeck preferably should be one-quarter inch thick, as this pan will have\r\nmuch more strain on it than the pans under the elevators. Where bolts\r\nare to be used, ordinary stove bolts will suffice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Plans for a pan to be placed under the opening\r\nbetween the platform and lower elevator of a grain binder in order\r\nto save the sweet-clover seed which falls on the platform and on the\r\nextension to the rear elevator plate. _A_, size and shape of the metal\r\nbefore bending; _B_, general plan of the pan when completed, as viewed\r\nfrom the top; _C_, cross section of the pan and outline of the support\r\nwhich holds it in position; _D_, stirrup which hooks over the inside\r\nand to which the support is fastened; _E_, door.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Rear view of a grain binder, showing a cross\r\nsection of the pans and supports and the parts of the machine to which\r\nthey are attached. _A_, Pan under the opening between the platform and\r\nlower elevator; _B_, support of the pan; _C_, stirrup which fits over\r\nthe inside sill and to which the support is bolted; _D_, angle iron\r\nunder the end of the platform and over which one end of the support is\r\nhooked; _E_, cross section of pan under the binder deck; _F_, support\r\nof the pan; _G_, stirrup which hooks over the outside sill and to which\r\nthe support is bolted; _H_, angle iron which supports the guard at the\r\nend of the deck; _I_, guard which directs the seed that falls on the\r\nbinder deck into the pan below; _J_, binder pipe over which one end of\r\nthe support is hooked.]\r\n\r\nThe plans for making the pan which should be placed under the opening\r\nbetween the platform and the lower elevator are illustrated in figure\r\n4. The material to be used for this pan should be cut to conform to the\r\nsize and shape shown in figure 4, _A_; the sides should then be bent\r\nupright along the dotted lines, so that the pan will be 18 inches wide\r\nat the top. One end, which should be solid, may be made so by bending\r\nthe center portion upright and then bending the sides against it. The\r\nside and center pieces should be riveted together. (Fig. 4, _C_.) Any\r\nsuitable door which will prevent seed from falling out of the pan will\r\nsuffice for the other end. A door is highly desirable, so that the seed\r\nmay be removed more easily when the pan is full. A convenient type is\r\nshown in figure 4, _E_. A top view of the pan when completed is given\r\nin figure 4, _B_. It will be necessary to brace the pan, and this may\r\nbe done by riveting strips of strap iron, preferably one-eighth inch\r\nthick and one-half inch wide, on the outer edges of the sides.\r\n\r\nThis pan is held in position by two supports made of strap iron,\r\npreferably seven-eighths inch wide and one-eighth inch thick, which\r\nhave been bent to conform to the outside of a cross section of the pan.\r\n(Figs. 4, _C_, and 5, _B_.) The ends of these supports which fasten\r\nunder the platform should be bent to a sharp angle and the tip of each\r\nslightly flattened, so that they may be pushed between the angle bar\r\nat the end of the platform and the bottom of the platform. The other\r\nend of each support should have a hole drilled in it, so that it may be\r\nbolted to the stirrups, which should be made to hook over the inside\r\nsill. (Figs. 4, _C_, and 5.) These supports should be placed about\r\n6 inches from the ends of the pan and riveted or bolted to it. This\r\nwill serve to brace the pan and to hold it in place. The pan may be\r\nattached to the machine by hooking the supports over the angle iron on\r\nthe bottom of the platform and by bolting them to the stirrups on the\r\nsill. By supporting the pan in this manner it may be easily and quickly\r\nattached or removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Plans for the pan to be placed under the binder\r\ndeck of the grain binder. _A_, Size and shape the metal should be cut\r\nbefore bending; _B_, general plan of the pan when completed, as viewed\r\nfrom the top.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Plans for the guard to be placed at the end of\r\nthe binder deck of the grain binder and cross section of the pan and\r\nsupports illustrated in figure 6. _A_, Size and shape of the metal for\r\nthe guard; _B_, shape of the guard when completed; _C_, cross section\r\nof the pan and support to which this guard is attached; _D_, angle iron\r\nwhich supports the guard at the end of the deck; _E_, guard bolted in\r\nposition; _F_, stirrup which hooks over the outside sill and to which\r\nthe support is belted.]\r\n\r\nThe pan to be placed under the deck of the machine will serve to\r\ncollect the seed which is shattered on the deck and the extension to\r\nthe deck. The plans for making this pan are shown in detail in figure\r\n6. The material should be cut along the solid lines and of the size\r\ndesignated in figure 6, _A_. The sides of the pan should be bent upward\r\non the dotted lines, so that the pan will be 24 inches wide at the\r\ntop. The ends should then be made in the manner described for the pan\r\nwhich is placed under the opening of the platform and lower elevator.\r\nA door may be put in the rear end of this pan if desired; but this\r\nis not necessary, as no trouble will be experienced in removing the\r\nseed. Figure 6, _B_, gives a top view of the pan when completed and\r\nalso a portion, of the guard which serves to direct into this pan the\r\nseed which shatters on the deck. This guard is shown in detail in\r\nfigure 7. As this pan is larger and heavier than that placed under\r\nthe lower elevator, not only should it have strips of iron riveted\r\nto the outer edges of the sides, but two cross braces also should be\r\nemployed. Those may be fastened to the strips of iron supporting the\r\nsides of the pan and should be about 12 inches from the ends of it.\r\nThis pan is supported by two strips of strap iron bent to conform to\r\nthe outside of a cross section of it and hook over the binder pipe\r\nunder the deck and bolt to stirrups placed on the outer sill of the\r\nframe. Each support may be made from one strip of strap iron. It may be\r\nnecessary to bend the ends of the supports which hook over the binder\r\npipe in opposite directions. Both ends of the supports which hook over\r\nthe binder pipe may hook outward, as shown in figure 7, _C_, or the\r\nrear support may hook inward, as illustrated in figure 5. It is not\r\nabsolutely necessary that those supports of the pan hook in opposite\r\ndirections on the binder pipe, yet when this is done it will make the\r\npan more rigid. The pan may be attached by first hooking the supports\r\nover the binder pipe underneath the deck and then bolting the other end\r\nof the supports to the stirrups on the outer sill. The pan should be\r\nfastened to the supports. A cross section of this pan, the supports for\r\nit, and the stirrups which hook over the sill are shown in figure 7,\r\n_C_.\r\n\r\nIf this pan extends beyond the deck so that the seed which is shattered\r\non the deck will drop directly into it, the bundles when released from\r\nthe packers will strike the pan. For this reason it is necessary to\r\nplace a guard at the end of the deck, so that the seed which falls on\r\nthe deck will be directed into the pan. This guard, as shown in figures\r\n5 and 7, consists of a piece of galvanized metal, to the upper side of\r\nwhich has been riveted a strip of iron. The upper side of this guard\r\nshould be bent slightly inward at the lower edge of the strip of iron\r\nand placed in such a position that it will be approximately 1-1/2\r\ninches beyond the lower end of the binder deck and extend from 1 to\r\n1-1/2 inches above the deck. If it is placed at right angles to the\r\ndeck and no higher than 1-1/2 inches above it, it will not interfere\r\nwith the bundles as they are released from the packers. This guard\r\nshould be supported by two angles of strap iron, as shown in figure 7,\r\n_D_. Those braces are bolted to the supports of the pan, and the guard\r\nis bolted to the braces. As this guard should extend a little below the\r\nsupports of the pan, so as to prevent the wind from blowing the seed\r\nover it, it is necessary to cut slots in the guard so it will fit over\r\nthe supports. The ends of this guard should be rolled slightly inward,\r\nso that the seed falling close to them will be directed into the pan.\r\nWhen the extension to the binder deck is placed in the proper position,\r\nthe seed collected by it will be directed against the guard and then\r\ninto the pan below.\r\n\r\nThe extension to the elevator should be bolted to the rear elevator\r\nplate. This extension should be so wide that the tops of the plants\r\nwill not reach beyond it. The details for this extension are shown in\r\nfigure 8. The outer edge and lower end of this extension should be bent\r\nupward and slightly inward, so that the seed which falls upon it will\r\nbe directed to the opening between the platform and lower elevator,\r\nwhere it will fall into the pan beneath. The curved edge of the lower\r\npart of this extension should be flattened as much as possible, so\r\nthat it will not interfere with the upper portions of the plants as\r\nthey pass from the platform to the elevators. The opening must be\r\nsufficiently large, however, to permit small branches and racemos which\r\nfall upon the extension to pass into the pan. The angle of the lower\r\nportion of it must be large enough to permit the seed to run directly\r\ninto the pan below. If this portion is sloped from the seat pipe to the\r\nopening between the platform and the lower elevator no trouble will be\r\nexperienced. This extension may be bolted to the machine by drilling\r\nholes in it to coincide with those in the elevator plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Plan of the extension which is bolted to the\r\nrear elevator plate of the grain binder. _A_, Size and shape of the\r\nmetal to be used for this extension; _B_, extension when completed.]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to widen the binder deck, so as to save the seed which\r\nis shattered from those portions of the plants which extend beyond it.\r\nThis may be done by bolting to the rear end of this deck an extension,\r\nas shown in detail in figure 9. This extension may be made from one\r\npiece of galvanized iron, which should be cut along the solid lines\r\nand of the size shown in figure 9, _A_. It should be bent upward and\r\nslightly inward at the dotted lines shown in this figure. The extended\r\nstrips, as shown in figure 9, _B_, should be riveted to the main part\r\nof the extension. When this is done a trough will be formed along the\r\nside and lower end of it, so that all seed which shatters upon it will\r\nbe directed into the pan below the deck. The object in riveting the\r\nextended strips at the end of the extension to the main part is to\r\nprevent the tops of the plants from catching in the trough when the\r\nbundles leave the packers. It may be necessary to fasten a brace to\r\nthe bottom of the deck to support this extension. This can be done,\r\nhowever, by using a strip of strap iron or wood. The upper end of\r\nthis extension should be bent to fit under the upper end of the one\r\nattached to the elevator plate, so that the plants will not be hindered\r\nin passing from one to the other. Both extensions may be braced\r\nstrongly at the top by fastening them to a right angle of iron or wood.\r\n\r\nA grain, binder equipped with the pans and extensions herein outlined\r\nis shown in figure 10.\r\n\r\nBinders equipped in the manner described have been tested carefully\r\nin different sections and have proved beyond doubt that they offer an\r\neconomical device for harvesting sweet clover for seed. This equipment\r\nhas been used most extensively in Livingston County, Ill., where\r\nfarmers have saved with it from $6 to $10 worth of seed per acre. When\r\nthis equipment is used the plants may be permitted to become somewhat\r\nmore mature before cutting, as the seed which is shattered will be\r\nsaved by the pans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Extension to the binder deck of the grain\r\nbinder. _A_, size and shape of the metal before bending; _B_, extended\r\npoints which are to be bolted to the main portion of the metal; _C_,\r\nextension when completed.]\r\n\r\nAs the pans and extensions described have been designed for one type of\r\nbinder, it may be necessary to modify them slightly for use on other\r\ntypes of machines. Before making a set of these pans and extensions\r\nfor any machine, the plans shown should be compared carefully with the\r\nbinder to be equipped, in order that any changes which will need to be\r\nmade may be noted. The pans and extensions at least maybe made on the\r\nfarm, and then it will be an easy matter to check up the measurements\r\nfor the supports, which may be made at a blacksmith shop.\r\n\r\nDifficulty may be experienced in cutting sweet clover with a binder\r\nwhen the first crop has been permitted to mature, as the plants may\r\nbe so tall that the machine will not handle them properly. This\r\ndifficulty may be overcome entirely in most sections of the country\r\nby pasturing the field until the first part of June or by cutting the\r\nfirst crop for hay. It is recommended that the stubble be left as high\r\nas possible when cutting sweet clover for seed. Not only will this\r\ngreatly facilitate harvesting but it will leave many of the woody,\r\nunpalatable portions of the plants on the ground, where they will decay\r\nquickly, and help to increase the humus content of the soil. (See the\r\nillustration on the title-page.)\r\n\r\nWhen the seed crop is cut with a binder it is best to shock the bundles\r\nas soon as possible, so as to avoid unnecessary shattering. Conditions\r\nshould determine whether the bundles be placed in long narrow shocks or\r\nin round shocks. The plants will cure somewhat faster in long narrow\r\nshocks, and this form should be preferred when grasshoppers are not\r\ntroublesome. Sweet-clover shocks should not be capped, as capping will\r\ncause some seed pods to shatter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--A grain binder equipped with pans and\r\nextensions to the rear elevator plate and binder deck to save the\r\nsweet-clover seed which is shattered while cutting the crop.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAIN HEADER.\r\n\r\nGrain headers have been used successfully for harvesting the\r\nsweet-clover seed crop in several sections of the United States,\r\nespecially in western Kansas. The principal advantages in using this\r\nmachine are that a larger acreage may be cut in a given time than with\r\neither a grain binder or a self-rake reaper and that a high stubble\r\nmay be left. The greater acreage which may be cut with a header is\r\nimportant when large acreages are to be harvested, as much seed is\r\nlost by shattering if the crop is not cut at the proper stage for\r\nharvesting, while the high stubble which may be left when cutting\r\nthe seed crop with a grain header is a decided advantage, as it not\r\nonly reduces greatly the weight and bulb of the plants which must be\r\nthrashed, but it also leaves the hard, woody portions on the ground,\r\nwhere they will decay and be of some value as a fertilizer. It is best\r\nto remove only those portions of the plants which contain sufficient\r\nseed to thrash, but this is not always possible, even with a header,\r\nunless the field contains a fairly thin stand and the plants are not\r\nmore than 4-1/2 to 5 feet high. When the seed crop is to be cut with\r\na grain header, it usually is permitted to stand somewhat longer than\r\nwhen other machines are used.\r\n\r\nA tin pan or some other receptacle should be placed at the lower end of\r\nthe header elevator in order to save the seed which otherwise would be\r\nlost at that place.\r\n\r\nThe plants are carried into header wagons or barges in the same way\r\nas grain. When a heavy crop is cut it will be necessary to have two\r\nmen in the barge to handle the plants. The floor of the header wagon\r\nshould be made perfectly tight, or it should be covered with a canvas\r\nor tarpaulin, so as to save the seed pods which shatter.\r\n\r\nWhen the crop is cut at the proper stage it may be placed directly in\r\nstacks or ricks without danger of heating or molding, provided the\r\nricks are covered or topped with some material which will shed water\r\nand are built upon a foundation, so that air may circulate under them.\r\nNative grass or green sweet-clover plants of the first year's crop will\r\nserve very nicely for topping the stacks.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom of some people to place the barge loads close together\r\nin individual stacks so located that they may be hauled quickly and\r\neasily to the thrashing machine. On other farms enough barge loads\r\nare placed together to make a rick approximately 10 by 10 by 40 feet\r\nin size. When each barge load is placed in a separate stack it is\r\nnecessary to load the plants again, so as to haul them to the thrashing\r\nmachine. The shattering of seed pods and the extra labor caused by\r\nreloading and by hauling the plants may be avoided for the most part\r\nby placing the crop in ricks large enough for a day's thrashing. It is\r\ngood practice to place such ricks in pairs sufficiently close together\r\nfor both to be pitched directly to the feeder of the machine. When this\r\nmethod is employed two days' thrashing may be done without moving the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe header binder, consisting of an attachment placed upon the header\r\nto bind the cut plants, has been used successfully in cutting the\r\nsweet-clover seed crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORN HARVESTER.\r\n\r\nCorn harvesters are proving to be efficient machines for cutting sweet\r\nclover which has made a growth too large to be cut with a grain binder.\r\nEven when the field has been seeded broadcast a 3-foot swath may be cut\r\nwith the corn harvester, provided the gathering or divider points are\r\nextended to collect the plants. This may be done by fastening to each\r\npoint a piece of wood or iron about 18 inches long. When a corn binder\r\nis used no more seed is lost from shattering than when an ordinary\r\ngrain harvester is employed, unless the later is equipped with special\r\npans and extensions, for the reason, primarily, that the portions of\r\nthe plants which produce most of the seed extend above the gathering\r\nor divider boards and are not crushed. When a 5-foot or larger growth\r\nis cut with a corn binder, the plants are tied below the seed-bearing\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nIn the semiarid sections of the country a limited quantity of sweet\r\nclover is planted in rows for both forage and seed production. In such\r\na case the seed may be harvested with a corn binder. (Fig. 11.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Cutting sweet clover for seed with a corn\r\nharvester. This field had been seeded in 30-inch rows.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTACKING THE SWEET-CLOVER SEED CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch discussion has taken place among extensive growers of sweet clover\r\nas to the advisability of stacking the seed crop after it is cut with a\r\ngrain binder or a corn harvester. The conditions present in each case\r\nshould determine the proper course to pursue. If it will be impossible\r\nto thrash within 10 days after cutting, much less seed will be lost by\r\nstacking two or three days after cutting than by permitting the plants\r\nto remain in the field subject to possible rains. In such cases it is\r\nurged that the crop be stacked, as the seed saved by this operation, if\r\nthe handling is done with care, will much more than pay for the labor.\r\nWhen it is possible to thrash in a week or 10 days after cutting,\r\nthe crop should be thrashed directly from the field, as little seed\r\nordinarily will be lost during this time and the work of stacking will\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\nWhen the crop is to be stacked, the stacks should be built in the same\r\nway as stacks of grain; and when properly built they will shed water\r\nas well as grain stacks. (Fig. 12.) It is well, however, to provide a\r\ncovering, and if canvas is not available a top-dressing of green grain\r\nor young sweet-clover plants will suffice. Sweet clover should remain\r\nin the stack for three or four weeks, as it will require about that\r\ntime for the plants to pass through the sweat. A stack should always\r\nbe placed on high ground, where water will not collect about the base,\r\nand it is recommended that a foundation of some kind be provided, so\r\nthat air may circulate beneath. A few posts or rails will answer this\r\npurpose very well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--A stack of sweet clover.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRASHING THE SWEET-CLOVER SEED CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo methods are in general use for thrashing the sweet-clover seed\r\ncrop. The seed may be flailed from the plants, or it may be removed by\r\na grain separator or a clover huller.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAILING THE SEED.\r\n\r\nMuch of the sweet-clover seed harvested in the South is flailed from\r\nthe plants. This method is necessarily slow and does not hull the seed.\r\nIt is practicable, therefore, only in regions where the necessary\r\nmachinery for hulling the seed crop is not available or where the\r\nacreage to be thrashed is very limited. One advantage of thrashing the\r\nseed in this manner is that the straw is left in the field, where it\r\nwill add much organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nWhen the seed is to be flailed, the crop ordinarily is cut with a\r\nscythe or mowing machine and the plants raked into piles or windrows.\r\nIf only small areas are to be harvested in this manner, a canvas or\r\ntarpaulin may be spread on the ground beside a windrow or pile and\r\nseveral forkfuls of sweet clover pitched on the canvas, where the seed\r\nmay be removed from the plants by striking them a few times with\r\nflails, sticks, or forks. After the plants have been struck a few times\r\nthey should be turned over and struck again. When the seed is removed\r\nfront the plants, the straw may be pitched to one side, the canvas\r\nplaced beside another portion of the windrow or by another pile, and\r\nthe operation repeated. It is not necessary to remove the seed from the\r\ncanvas until its weight or bulk interferes with moving the canvas.\r\n\r\nIt is the practice in some sections of the country to place a\r\nwell-braced frame, covered with wire netting, on a sled and to flail\r\nthe seed on this frame. The netting used for covering the frame should\r\nhave meshes 1 inch or loss in diameter. The sled should be at least 7\r\nfeet wide and 10 feet long and should have sides and ends approximately\r\n12 inches high. Smaller sleds sometimes are used, but a larger one is\r\nto be preferred if two or more persons are to flail on it at one time.\r\nIf the floor of the sled is not perfectly tight, it should be covered\r\nwith canvas and the edges of the canvas thrown over the sides and ends\r\nof the sled, so as to avoid losing any of the seed and to facilitate\r\nits removal. A sled so equipped may be drawn from pile to pile, the\r\nplants pitched on it, the seed flailed from them, and the straw\r\nreturned to the land for soil improvement.\r\n\r\nAnother method, very similar to that just described, is to place a\r\nframe on a hayrack. The frame should be built sufficiently strong and\r\nin such a manner that the person who is to do the flailing may stand\r\non it. It should be covered preferably with galvanized-wire netting\r\nhaving half-inch meshes, and if this is stretched tightly it will\r\nserve to strengthen the frame. If it is not practicable to make the\r\nhayrack perfectly tight, it should be covered with a tarpaulin or\r\ncanvas. A wagon so equipped may be pulled from pile to pile or along\r\nthe windrows, where one person may pitch the plants upon the frame, to\r\nbe flailed by one or more persons standing on it. After the seed is\r\nremoved from the plants, the straw may be scattered easily and quickly\r\nover the ground for soil improvement.\r\n\r\nFlailed seed should be cleaned thoroughly with sieves and fanning\r\nmills to remove the inert matter and immature pods before it is sown\r\nor offered for sale on the market. It is recommended that whenever\r\npossible unhulled seed be run through a clover huller to hull the seed\r\nor through an Ames hulling and scarifying machine to remove the hulls\r\nand to scarify the seed. By this process the outer coat of the seed\r\nis scratched or broken. The scarifying increases the percentage of\r\ngermination by facilitating the entrance of moisture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Thrashing sweet clover with a grain separator.\r\nNote the large sleds used for handling the plants from the field to the\r\nthrashing machine.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAIN SEPARATOR.\r\n\r\nA grain separator (fig. 13) is used more than any other machine for\r\nthrashing sweet clover. This is because more grain separators than\r\nclover hullers are found in localities where sweet clover is grown\r\nand because the ordinary clover huller will not handle a large growth\r\nof sweet clover satisfactorily. When the grain separator is operated\r\ncarefully no trouble should be experienced in removing the seed from\r\nthe plants, but it is necessary to make certain adjustments if the\r\nseed is to be hulled. The adjustments required will vary somewhat with\r\nthe make of machine and the dryness of the crop. The riddles should be\r\nadjusted or changed so they will handle sweet-clover seed properly.\r\nAlfalfa or red-clover riddles will answer this purpose. The speed of\r\nthe fan should be decreased, so the seed will not be blown over, and\r\nthis usually will be accomplished when the speed is reduced to about\r\none-half that used in thrashing grain. The number of rows of concave\r\nteeth which should be used will vary with the dryness of the plants\r\nand somewhat with their size. When it is not desired to hull the seed,\r\none or two rows of concave teeth will be sufficient. Some operators\r\nbelieve that one or two rows are sufficient to hull 40 to 50 per cent\r\nof the seed when the plants are very dry. Those are exceptional cases,\r\nand hulled seed should not be expected unless more rows of concave\r\nteeth are used. If hulled seed is desired it is recommended that a\r\nfull set be used and that these be set to run closer to the cylinder\r\nteeth than is customary when thrashing grain. Some operators replace\r\ntwo rows of the smooth, concave teeth with corrugated teeth. This\r\npractice is recommended wherever possible, as the corrugated teeth will\r\nfacilitate greatly the hulling of the seed. Even where these changes\r\nare made, only a small percentage of the seed will be hulled if the\r\npods are damp. If the plants have been permitted to make a very large\r\ngrowth the machine may clog unless the number of rows of concave teeth\r\nis reduced. Clogging may be overcome for the most part by feeding the\r\nbundles to the machine slowly. This precaution is necessary regardless\r\nof the size of the plants if the seed is to be removed properly and\r\nhulled. It is possible to hull from 90 to 95 per cent of the seed when\r\nthe proper adjustments are made and the plants are dry.\r\n\r\nA clover-hulling attachment, which consists for the most part of\r\nspecial sieves and a number of rows of corrugated concave teeth which\r\nreplace the ordinary concave teeth, has been used with success in\r\ndifferent sections of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOVER HULLER.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, ordinary clover hullers do not handle sweet clover very\r\nsatisfactorily. Machines with cylinders larger than those commonly used\r\nare giving fair satisfaction provided the plants do not make a large\r\ngrowth, but even these machines have not been so successful as properly\r\nadjusted and equipped grain separators. A clover huller will handle a 2\r\nto 3 foot growth of sweet clover if the rows of thrashing concaves are\r\nreduced and the plants are fed slowly to the machine. It will not hull\r\nsweet clover as well as red clover, and it is very doubtful whether\r\nit will hull more seed than a grain separator equipped with a hulling\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer of at least one clover huller has designed special\r\nrasps for the hulling cylinder and concaves of his machine, and these\r\nrasps do better work than the ones ordinarily used for hulling red\r\nclover.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom in some localities to run the sweet clover through a\r\nthrashing machine without adjusting the concaves and then to run the\r\nunhulled seed as delivered by the grain separator through a clover\r\nhuller. A fair quality of seed may be obtained by this process, but\r\nit calls for much extra labor and time, and for this reason should be\r\navoided Whenever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYIELDS OF SWEET-CLOVER SEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany factors besides shattering influence the yield of sweet-clover\r\nseed. As only those portions of the plants exposed directly to the\r\nsunlight set seed abundantly, thin stands usually produce more seed to\r\nthe acre than heavy stands. When very heavy stands make a large growth,\r\nseed is produced only on the upper 24 to 30 inches of the plants,\r\nwhereas with thinner stands it is produced on the lower branches as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of moisture in the soil at the time the seed is maturing\r\nis an important factor also. During hot, dry weather the plants may not\r\nbe able to absorb from the soil sufficient water to supply the excess\r\nrequired by them for seed production. In this event many of the seed\r\npods will abort and fall when partly mature. Pods abort and fall in\r\na very short time, so that partly shriveled ones seldom are found on\r\nthe plants, although the extent of the aborting is shown by the number\r\nof barren racemos. When such weather conditions prevail, the second\r\ncrop usually will produce a heavier yield than the first crop. This is\r\ndue for the most part to the inability of the large plants to obtain\r\nsufficient water for seed production. The much smaller plants of the\r\nsecond crop do not require as much moisture as the larger plants of the\r\nfirst crop, as the vegetative growth is seldom more than half as much.\r\n\r\nThe type of root growth has much to do with the quantity of water the\r\nplants are able to obtain during droughty weather. When sweet clover is\r\nplanted on soil that has a tendency to be wet, the plants will produce\r\na much-branched shallow root system instead of the normal deep roots\r\nwhich are found on well-drained soils. During dry weather the upper\r\nlayers of soil become so depleted that plants having a very large\r\npercentage of their roots in these layers can not obtain a sufficient\r\nquantity of moisture to supply their requirements for seed production.\r\n\r\nIt is often stated that the first crop of sweet clover will produce\r\nmore seed to the acre than the second crop. This depends very largely\r\nupon the thickness of the stand and on weather conditions. In regions\r\nwhere two crops may be grown in a season, the first usually will\r\nproduce more seed to the acre than the second if the field has a thin\r\nstand. When the stand is thick the second crop ordinarily yields more\r\nseed. In regions where a crop of hay or pasturage may be obtained in\r\naddition to the seed crop, it is seldom an economical procedure to\r\npermit the first crop to mature. Not only will sweet clover produce an\r\nabundance of nutritious pasturage or a cutting of 1 to 3 tons of hay in\r\naddition to the seed, but the difficulty of handling the large, stemmy\r\ngrowth of the first crop for seed is avoided.\r\n\r\nYields of sweet-clover seed have been reduced during the last two\r\nseasons by several fungous diseases. Experimental work has not been\r\ncompleted to show the percentage of damage done by these organisms, but\r\nin some sections of the country seed yields were reduced considerably.\r\nThe clover stem borer,[2] which is prevalent in red clover in certain\r\nsections of the country, also infests sweet clover. It is probable that\r\nthis insect did some damage to the seed crop in certain sections of the\r\ncountry in 1916.\r\n\r\n[2] Languria mozardi.\r\n\r\nThe yield of sweet-clover seed varies from 2 to 10 bushels of\r\nre-cleaned seed per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET-CLOVER STRAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet-clover straw may be utilized for soil improvement or as a\r\nroughage for stock. When it is not needed for feeding it should be\r\nturned under, as it will add much humus and nitrogen to the soil.\r\nWhen the seed is flailed from the plants the straw may be easily and\r\nquickly spread over the land at the time of flailing, but when the\r\ncrop is thrashed with a grain separator or a clover huller it will be\r\nnecessary to haul the straw and scatter it over the field. When the\r\ncrop is thrashed in this manner the straw will be broken and crushed\r\nso that stock will eat it freely. The straw may be run directly from\r\nthe thrashing machine into the silo, where, by adding sufficient water,\r\nit can be made into good silage.
