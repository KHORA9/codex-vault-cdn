S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY\r\n\r\nFOSSIL FERN FROM COAL MINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE STORY OF COAL_\r\n\r\n_The Origin of Coal_\r\n\r\nONE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the vegetable origin of coal is beyond question, two rival views\r\nare current among geologists to account for the deposit of ancient\r\nplant material in the form of coal-beds, such as we now find in the\r\nearth. One school of geologists holds that the coal plants grew in\r\ngreat lagoons and swamps, like the mangrove swamps of today, and that\r\nthe modern coal-beds mark the locations of these swamps. From time to\r\ntime these areas subsided and were flooded with water to such a depth\r\nthat the plants were killed. Eventually the decayed vegetation of the\r\nformer swamps was covered with a layer of mud or sand. Later a slow\r\nupheaval of the ground brought these regions again to the surface; a\r\nnew swamp formed, only to be submerged again at a later period; and the\r\nsame process was repeated several times in the course of hundreds of\r\nthousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of evidence seems to favor this view, but there is another.\r\nPerhaps the coal-beds are not the sites of former swamps, but of\r\nestuaries and ocean shores where the plant material settled down,\r\nin still water, after a long drift down the ancient rivers from its\r\nplace of origin. It is not impossible that both explanations are\r\ncorrect; some coal-beds having been formed in one way, and some in the\r\nother. With the progress of time the deposits of sand were compacted\r\ninto sandstone, and the mud and clay into shale; while the layers of\r\nvegetation were solidified by pressure, some of their constituents were\r\nvaporized and expelled by heat, and the final product was coal.\r\n\r\nThe coal-measures abound in fossil plants of species long ago extinct,\r\nand we also find the molds or casts of plants that have themselves\r\ndisappeared, leaving only their impressions in the mud by which they\r\nwere once enveloped. These records of ancient vegetation are mostly\r\nfound in the rocks just above and below the coal-beds, and not in the\r\ncoal itself.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the Carboniferous Period, during which most but not all\r\nof the coal-beds were formed, bore a family likeness to certain kinds\r\nof plants that flourish today. Many of them were ferns, ranging in size\r\nfrom the smallest species up to great tree-ferns. Others resembled our\r\nmodern horsetails or scouring-rushes, with their fluted and jointed\r\nstems, but these _calamites_, as the geologists call them, grew to\r\nthe size of trees, sometimes eighty or ninety feet in height. Some\r\nplants of the coal age were like the modern cycads (intermediate in\r\nappearance between tree-ferns and palms); some were like the ginkgo, a\r\ntree with leaves like those of maidenhair fern, widely introduced into\r\nthis country from China and Japan. One of the commonest and largest\r\ntrees was the _lepidodendron_, closely resembling, except in its vastly\r\ngreater size, the club-moss or ground pine which we know so well as a\r\nChristmas decoration.\r\n\r\nThe animal life of the period, of which, also, abundant fossil remains\r\nare found, included mollusks, fishes, crustaceans, insects, spiders,\r\nthousand-legs, snails, reptiles and lizards. Some of the insects were a\r\nfoot or more in length. Of cockroaches, alone, more than five hundred\r\nspecies have been found in the coal-measures.\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR.

BUREAU OF MINES\r\n\r\nTIPPLE AT BITUMINOUS COAL MINE GARY, WEST VIRGINIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE STORY OF COAL_\r\n\r\n_The Coal Fields of the United States_\r\n\r\nTWO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a coal famine is upon us there is a grain of comfort in the\r\nreflection that beneath the soil of this country, and within 3,000\r\nfeet of the surface, there still lies 3,538,554,000,000 tons of coal.\r\nThis is the estimate of the United States Geological Survey. We have\r\nmined coal wastefully and used it prodigally, yet we have taken from\r\nthe ground, up to the present time, only a fraction of one per cent. of\r\nthe total amount at our disposal. The whole of our “coal reserves,” if\r\nthey could be extracted and placed in a great cubical pile, would form\r\na mass 8.4 miles long, 8.4 miles wide and 8.4 miles high. If the coal\r\nthus far mined were piled up in the same way, the cube would be 7,200\r\nfeet long, 7,200 feet wide, and 7,200 feet high.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] These figures were furnished by Mr. M. R. Campbell, of the\r\n    U. S. Geological Survey. They differ materially from figures\r\n    previously published by the Survey.\r\n\r\nThe coal-producing areas of the country are divided into six great\r\ndivisions, known as the Eastern Province, the Interior Province, the\r\nGulf Province, the Northern Great Plains Province, the Rocky Mountain\r\nProvince, and the Pacific Coast Province. The Eastern Province\r\ncontains probably nine-tenths of the high-rank coal of the country.\r\nIt is made up of the anthracite regions of Pennsylvania and Rhode\r\nIsland, the Atlantic coast region of Virginia and North Carolina, and\r\nthe great Appalachian region, which embraces all the bituminous and\r\nsemi-bituminous coal of what is called the “Appalachian trough.” The\r\nstate of Pennsylvania produces 47 per cent. of all the coal mined in\r\nthe country, and nearly all of the anthracite.\r\n\r\nThe Appalachian region is the greatest storehouse of high-rank coal\r\nin the United States, if not in the world. “This near-by and almost\r\ninexhaustible supply of high-grade fuel,” says the Geological Survey,\r\n“has been the foundation of the development of the blast furnaces, the\r\ngreat iron and steel mills, and the countless manufacturing enterprises\r\nof the Eastern states.”\r\n\r\nThe Interior Province includes all the bituminous coal fields and\r\nregions near the Great Lakes, in the Mississippi Valley, and in Texas,\r\nand is made up of four distinct sections--the northern (Michigan),\r\neastern (Illinois, Indiana and western Kentucky), western (Iowa,\r\nMissouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas), and southwestern (Texas). The\r\ncoal of this province is not, in general, of as high a quality as that\r\nof the Eastern Province, but it is very extensively mined, and is used\r\nfor heating and for generating power in the many cities and towns of\r\nthe Mississippi valley and the Great Lakes region. Indeed, extensive\r\ncoal fields in proximity to rich agricultural lands have made possible\r\nthe existence of such manufacturing centers as Chicago, St. Louis and\r\nKansas City, and have been a leading factor in the development of the\r\nvast railway systems of the Middle West.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Province is at present of little commercial importance. Its\r\ncoal is mined only at a few places in Texas, and is mostly lignite.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Great Plains Province includes all the coal fields in the\r\nGreat Plains east of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The coals\r\nare of low rank, being either lignite or sub-bituminous, except in a\r\nfew of the basins near the mountains. The largest coal region in this\r\nprovince is the Fort Union region, lying in the Dakotas, Montana and\r\nWyoming. The amount of unmined coal in this region is estimated to be\r\ntwice as great as that lying in the rich Appalachian region, but it has\r\nbeen little worked, as it is generally of poor quality.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Mountain Province contains a greater variety of coal than\r\nany other province in the United States. It includes all ranks, from\r\nlignite to anthracite, but the prevailing ranks are sub-bituminous and\r\nlow-grade bituminous.\r\n\r\nThe coal of the Pacific Coast Province is mined chiefly in the state\r\nof Washington, where it has aided in developing the industries of the\r\nPuget Sound region. Oregon and California have small fields, but the\r\ncoal is of poor quality, and little mining has been attempted.\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR.

CLEVELAND, O.\r\n\r\nCOAL CAR DUMPER IN OPERATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE STORY OF COAL_\r\n\r\n_Handling Coal_\r\n\r\nTHREE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn times gone by coal was carried out of the mines on the shoulders\r\nof men and women, and then transferred in wheelbarrows to the\r\nsailing-vessels or wagons in which it was taken to market. In\r\nprogressive mines of today the coal is loaded in the mine into small\r\nmine cars, which are hauled and hoisted to the surface by electricity\r\nor steam. The mine cars are dumped on an elevated platform called\r\nthe “tipple,” and the coal passes through chutes or conveyors to the\r\nrailway cars waiting underneath to receive it. On its way downward it\r\nundergoes a more or less elaborate process of screening, breaking,\r\npicking, washing, etc., according to the kind of coal and the purpose\r\nfor which it is to be used.\r\n\r\nThe coal reaches the market by three general methods of transportation:\r\n(1) All-rail; (2) rail to the seaports, where it is used for bunkering\r\nsteamers or carried by vessels to other ports, foreign and domestic;\r\n(3) rail to the Great Lakes, especially Lake Erie ports, from which\r\nit is carried to ports on the upper lakes, and from the latter again\r\nby rail to markets in the interior. The railroads themselves use\r\nabout one-fourth of all the coal mined in this country. The coastwise\r\ncoal-carrying trade is mainly by wooden barges towed by steamers,\r\nthough much coal is also carried by schooners, some of which can carry\r\na cargo of 5,000 tons or more. About four per cent. of the bituminous\r\ncoal output goes to foreign countries.\r\n\r\n“The consumption of coal,” says the United States Geological Survey,\r\n“is a measure of the industrial activity of a people, for as yet coal\r\nis the main source of mechanical energy. In this respect the United\r\nStates is the foremost nation, its average annual consumption of coal\r\nfor all purposes being about five tons per capita. Prior to the present\r\nwar in Europe the consumption of coal per capita in England, Belgium\r\nand Germany was about four tons, in Russia a quarter of a ton, and in\r\nFrance about 1.6 tons.”\r\n\r\nMarvelous forms of labor-saving machinery have been introduced to\r\nfacilitate the loading and unloading of coal. The principal form of\r\napparatus for transferring coal either to or from a vessel is the\r\n“bridge tramway plant,” which consists of long steel bridges mounted\r\nside by side on suitable rails so that they can be moved into place\r\nover the hatchway of a vessel. Huge buckets, which load and unload\r\nthemselves, are carried on a “trolley,” suspended from the bridge,\r\nand transfer coal at high speed from the vessel to the stock pile or\r\nrailway cars, or _vice versa_. The cost of loading coal by this method\r\nis only a cent or two a ton.\r\n\r\nAnother ingenious device is the “car-dumper.” This powerful machine\r\npicks up bodily from the railway track a car loaded with a hundred tons\r\nof coal, overturns it, and discharges its contents into the hold of a\r\nvessel; after which it returns the car to the track. It is capable of\r\nhandling fifty cars an hour. It is equipped with special apparatus to\r\nprevent the coal from being discharged too violently, and thus being\r\nbadly broken up.\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR.

The marvels of fairyland are\r\nsurpassed by the achievements of the modern manufacturer in obtaining\r\nfrom mere black rocks dug out of the ground not only heat and light,\r\nbut a bewildering variety of useful gases, liquids and solids--drugs,\r\nchemicals, dyestuffs, and so forth.\r\n\r\nFor hundreds of years it has been known that when coal is covered\r\nor enclosed, to keep out the air, and then heated for a certain\r\nlength of time, instead of burning to ash it is converted into a\r\nporous grayish-black substance called “coke.” This material, which\r\nburns without smoke or flame, is a valuable fuel for many purposes;\r\nespecially for use in blast-furnaces for the smelting of ore. Nowadays\r\ncoke is made on a vast scale from certain grades of bituminous and\r\nsemi-bituminous coal. The coal is heated in “coking-ovens,” of which\r\nthere are several kinds. The most common form of oven in this country\r\nis the “bee-hive oven,” which produces coke only. Another type of\r\ncoking-oven, more generally used in Europe than in America, is the\r\n“flue-oven,” which produces, besides coke, a number of valuable\r\nby-products.\r\n\r\nWhen coal is converted into coke it gives off combustible gases. The\r\nidea of saving these gases and using them for illuminating purposes\r\nwas first practically applied in the latter part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. “Coal-gas” is made by heating coal in a closed vessel, called\r\na “retort.” It is a mixture of hydrogen and methane (a compound of\r\nhydrogen and carbon), with small amounts of several other gases. Most\r\nof the carbon in the coal remains in the retort as coke, which is,\r\ntherefore, a by-product in the process of making coal-gas. After the\r\ngas is given off from the coal it passes through a series of vessels,\r\nwhere, by chemical and other methods, it is freed from ingredients\r\nwhich would impair its value as an illuminant, but which are saved and\r\nused for other purposes; the most important of these are “coal-tar”\r\nand “ammoniacal liquor.” The purified coal-gas is finally conveyed\r\nto a gas-holder or “gasometer,” from which it is distributed to the\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\nIn recent times other methods of gas-making have come into use. In one\r\nof these nearly all the carbon in the fuel is turned into a combustible\r\ngas by passing air through the hot coal. The product is known as\r\n“producer-gas,” and is very valuable for use as fuel and as a motive\r\npower in gas-engines, but it is not an illuminant. A modification of\r\nthis process, in which steam is passed over the heated fuel, gives\r\na mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, known as “water-gas.”\r\nThis is also a valuable source of heat and power; but for use as an\r\nilluminant it must be mixed with a gas made from oil. It is then known\r\nas “carburetted water-gas,” and is very extensively used for lighting\r\npurposes; either by itself or mixed with ordinary coal-gas.\r\n\r\nOf the by-products of gas-making, ammoniacal liquor was, until\r\nrecently, the only commercial source of ammonia. Coal-tar, formerly\r\nthrown away as worthless, is today the source of innumerable substances\r\nof immense value to science and the industries. From coal-tar are\r\nobtained benzine, toluene, xylene, phenol (carbolic acid), naphthalene,\r\nanthracene, etc., and these more direct products are combined with\r\none another or with other chemicals to produce coloring matters,\r\nexplosives, perfumes, flavoring materials, sweetening substances,\r\ndisinfectants, medicines, photographic developers--in short, a little\r\nof everything. The total number of coal-tar products runs into the\r\nthousands, and is constantly being increased by fresh discoveries.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, just before the war, the industries engaged in making these\r\nproducts (no longer _by_-products, but far more important than coke and\r\ngas) were capitalized at $750,000,000. One firm made no less than 1,800\r\ncoal-tar dyes, besides 120 pharmaceutical and photographic preparations.\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR.

This is not the beginning of\r\nan appeal on behalf of the anti-cigarette crusade, but the introduction\r\nto a few facts in regard to the far-reaching effects of smoky chimneys.\r\nThe smoke nuisance is as old as the use of coal. In the fourteenth\r\ncentury a man was executed in London for befouling the air of that\r\ncity with the fumes of “sea-coal,” as ordinary mineral coal was once\r\ncalled in England, because it was brought to London by sea. Under\r\nQueen Elizabeth a law was passed forbidding the burning of coal while\r\nParliament was in session, as the legislators believed their health was\r\nlikely to be impaired by the smoky air of the city. What would these\r\nbygone gentlemen say if they could see modern London enveloped in one\r\nof its famous “pea-soup” fogs--the color and denseness of which are\r\nentirely due to coal-smoke?\r\n\r\nSmoke is injurious to health, destructive to vegetation, and fatal\r\nto architectural beauty; and, along with all this, it is enormously\r\nexpensive. In the first place, a smoky chimney means imperfect\r\ncombustion, and a waste of part of the heating value of fuel. Then a\r\nsmoky atmosphere entails big laundry and dry-cleaning bills; frequent\r\nrepainting of houses; injury to metal work; damage to goods in shops;\r\nexcessive artificial lighting in the daytime. Pittsburgh was once\r\nthe most famous American example of all these evils, but it has\r\nrecently reformed. Before the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research\r\ncarried out its elaborate smoke investigation in that city, and, in\r\nconsequence, stringent smoke-abatement ordinances were adopted, the\r\nannual smoke bill of Pittsburgh was estimated at nearly ten million\r\ndollars. The city was the paradise of the laundryman, and light-colored\r\nclothing was so little worn by the inhabitants that it was known as\r\n“the mourning town.”\r\n\r\nThroughout the United States it is said that smoke causes an annual\r\nwaste and damage amounting to half a billion dollars. No wonder\r\nnumerous societies have been formed to mitigate this evil, and a great\r\nmany laws have been enacted on the subject. With a gradual increase in\r\nthe use of gas, coke and other smokeless fuels, and improved methods of\r\nstoking furnaces, the smoke nuisance is now happily abating.\r\n\r\nThe pollution of the air by smoke is the subject of systematic\r\ninvestigation and measurement at certain places in this country and\r\nabroad. Measurements of the “soot-fall” made in Pittsburgh a few years\r\nago indicated an annual average deposit of soot in that city amounting\r\nto 1,031 tons per square mile. London’s average is 248 tons per square\r\nmile for the whole city and 426 tons in the central districts. In the\r\nheart of Glasgow the annual soot-fall is 820 tons per square mile.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain there is a Committee for the Investigation of\r\nAtmospheric Pollution, which has installed standard measuring apparatus\r\nin sixteen English and Scotch towns. The soot is collected in a\r\n“pollution gauge,” consisting of a large cast-iron funnel, enameled\r\non the inside. Projecting above the gauge is a wire screen, open at\r\nthe top, to prevent birds from settling on the edge of the vessel.\r\nThe gauge communicates at the bottom with one or more bottles for\r\ncollecting rain-water, with its solid contents. The bottles are emptied\r\nonce a month, when their contents are weighed and analyzed.\r\n\r\nSmoke is injurious to the respiratory organs, conducive to eye-strain\r\nand responsible for a lowering of human vitality. The gloominess of a\r\nsmoke-laden atmosphere also has a depressing effect upon the minds of\r\nmany people.\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR.

BUREAU OF MINES\r\n\r\nRESCUE PARTY ENTERING MINE AFTER EXPLOSION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE STORY OF COAL_\r\n\r\n_Safety in Coal Mines_\r\n\r\nSIX\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the year 1870, some 60,000 men have lost their lives as a result\r\nof coal mining accidents in this country. This is approximately one\r\nfatality for every 180,000 tons of coal mined. Gradually this bad\r\nrecord is being improved, thanks to the combined efforts of the United\r\nStates Bureau of Mines, the mining departments of the various states,\r\nthe operators and the miners themselves; but coal mining remains a\r\nhazardous pursuit.\r\n\r\nFalls of the roof are responsible for more accidents than any other\r\nsingle cause. These are likely to occur wherever the roof is not fully\r\ntimbered; especially in the “rooms,” where the coal is being blasted\r\nout. Many accidents also occur in mine shafts, notwithstanding the\r\nvarious safety devices with which the “cage” or elevator is nowadays\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nFires and explosions attract a greater amount of public attention than\r\nother mining disasters on account of the large number of victims so\r\noften involved in a single occurrence of this kind. In the explosion\r\nat the Courrières colliery, in France, March 10, 1906, more than\r\n1,100 miners perished. This mine had previously been renowned for its\r\nfreedom from accidents. Coal mine explosions are due to two principal\r\ncauses, which may act either separately or in combination--fire-damp\r\nand coal-dust. Accumulations of fire-damp, or methane, locked up in\r\nthe coal seams, are liberated by the removal of the coal. Frequently\r\nstreams of this gas gush forth with a hissing noise, and are known\r\nas “blowers.” Fire-damp is explosive when combined with certain\r\nproportions of air. Apart from ventilation, which dilutes the gas below\r\nthe danger limit, the principal precaution against explosives is the\r\nuse of safety-lamps, so constructed that the gas cannot come in contact\r\nwith a naked flame. An excessive amount of coal-dust in the air of the\r\nmine may also give rise to explosions. Such explosions may be prevented\r\nby wetting the dust, moistening the air, or powdering the walls, roof\r\nand floor with a non-explosive “rock-dust.”\r\n\r\nAfter an explosion the air of a mine contains a large amount of the\r\ndeadly gas carbon monoxide, and this “after-damp,” as it is called,\r\nmakes rescue work extremely dangerous. Wherever suitable apparatus\r\nis available, the rescuers carry with them a supply of oxygen, by\r\nbreathing which they are able to live for some hours in a poisonous\r\natmosphere. The Bureau of Mines has established a number of rescue\r\nstations in the coal-mining districts and maintains several mine\r\nsafety cars for hurrying rescue crews to the scene of a disaster. The\r\nBureau also instructs the miners in first-aid and rescue work, and is\r\ndirecting a national campaign in behalf of “safety first” in mines.\r\n\r\nOf the many methods that have been devised for testing the air of\r\nmines for noxious gases none is more interesting than the use of caged\r\ncanaries. These birds are much more susceptible than human beings to\r\nthe effects of carbon monoxide, and show signs of distress before a\r\nman begins to feel any discomfort from the gas. In many mines they\r\nare carried in routine inspections. After an explosion the number of\r\nrescuers equipped with oxygen apparatus is always limited. These form\r\nthe advance guard, and are followed by men without apparatus, who\r\ncarry canaries, by observing the behavior of which they can tell how\r\nfar they may safely penetrate into the mine. The Bureau of Mines has\r\ndevised a special form of cage in which the canary may be revived with\r\noxygen after being overcome with gas. Experiments show that the bird\r\nmay be asphyxiated and revived again and again without suffering any\r\nill-effects; neither does he acquire an immunity to poisoning which\r\nwould make him a less reliable indicator.\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR.

No human being, mammal\r\nor bird yet existed. Animal life included fish, shellfish and other\r\naquatic species, besides reptiles and insects. The vegetal forms\r\nresembled our modern ferns, horsetails, club-mosses and evergreens.\r\nThe atmosphere was heavily charged with moisture, and a mild climate\r\nprevailed even in the polar regions. Such were the conditions under\r\nwhich, during the great Carboniferous Age, most of the existing\r\ncoal-beds were deposited in the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOREST SWAMP OF THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD (Coal Age).\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by Potonié and Gothan]\r\n\r\nCoal is the litter of primeval swamps and forests. Year after year the\r\ndébris of the humid jungles accumulated in shallow water or in the\r\nboggy soil, where it underwent partial decay, and was thus converted,\r\nfirst of all, into the slimy or spongy material known as “peat.”\r\nSimilar deposits are in process of formation in the swamps of the\r\npresent day, and the peat obtained from them is dried and used as fuel\r\non an extensive scale in some parts of the world; especially Ireland,\r\nHolland, Germany and Scandinavia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONCRETE PORTAL OF A “DRIFT” MINE]\r\n\r\nGradual changes in the elevation of the land led to the submergence\r\nof the prehistoric peat bogs, during successive intervals of time, by\r\nlakes or shallow seas. Thus their vegetation was killed, and they were\r\noverspread with layers of mud or sand, above which, during a subsequent\r\nperiod of elevation, a new peat bog would form; and this process was\r\nrepeated several times. The conversion of the peat into coal appears\r\nto have resulted from the pressure of the overlying strata, probably\r\naided by the internal heat of the earth. Much of its moisture was\r\nsqueezed and evaporated out; the proportions of its component gases\r\nwere reduced; and the result was a hard mineral, which has earned\r\nthe popular name of “black diamond” because consisting chiefly of\r\ncarbon--the same chemical element which, in a pure and crystalline\r\nform, constitutes the true diamond. Chemically, coal consists of\r\ncarbon; the gases hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen; sulphur; and ash (the\r\nmineral matter that remains after combustion).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of United States National Museum\r\n\r\nComparative coal supplies of the world. The nick in the smallest cube\r\nshows how much hard coal has been used up. Soft coal cube has hardly\r\nbeen scratched]\r\n\r\nThe record of these long-ago events is found when we sink a shaft\r\nthrough typical coal-bearing strata. We pass through not one, but\r\nseveral, layers of coal, which may vary in thickness from a fraction of\r\nan inch to a hundred feet or more, and are separated by generally much\r\nthicker layers of sandstone or shale (solidified clay). The layers of\r\ncoal are known as “coal-beds.” Unless a coal-bed is at least two feet\r\nthick it is hardly worth working, and, ordinarily, the thickness of a\r\nbed does not exceed eight or ten feet. The shale or sandstone above a\r\nbed is very commonly found to contain the remains or the impressions\r\nof the ancient plants from which the coal was formed. A study of these\r\nremains and casts has made it possible to classify hundreds of species\r\nof plants now extinct. Fragments of plants are also sometimes found in\r\nthe coal itself, and thin slices of coal frequently show a vegetable\r\nstructure under the microscope. Finally, to furnish conclusive proof\r\nof the vegetable origin of coal, we find under the coal-bed a layer\r\nknown as the “underclay,” which is a fossil soil filled with the roots\r\nand rootlets of the coal-producing plants. Different conditions of\r\nformation, and also, probably, differences in the character of the\r\noriginal vegetation, have resulted in the production of different kinds\r\nof coal. The most important heat-producing constituent in coal is the\r\nelementary substance called “carbon,” and the simplest classification\r\nof solid fuels depends upon the percentages of fixed (non-volatile)\r\ncarbon they contain, the average percentages running as follows: Wood,\r\n50%; peat, 55%; lignite, 73%; bituminous coal, 84%; anthracite coal,\r\n93%. When fuel is burned the greater part of it unites chemically with\r\nthe oxygen of the air to form certain invisible gases--especially\r\ncarbon dioxide and water-vapor--and only the ash remains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From “Geology, Physical and Historical,” by H. P.\r\nCleland. American Book Co., N. Y.\r\n\r\nSection of coal-bearing strata in Pennsylvania, showing relative amount\r\nof coal and barren rock in a rich field]\r\n\r\nIn the popular mind coal is classified as hard or soft, while hard coal\r\nis further classified according to the size of the lumps. For both\r\nscientific and industrial purposes more elaborate classifications are\r\nnecessary, and several have been used or proposed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COAL FIELDS OF THE UNITED STATES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kinds of Coal_\r\n\r\nThe United States Geological Survey classifies coals, first of all,\r\naccording to “rank,” depending upon both chemical and physical\r\ncharacteristics. Anthracite, which contains the largest percentage of\r\ncarbon, ranks highest, and lignite, with the smallest percentage of\r\ncarbon, lowest. Coals of the same rank are said to be of high or low\r\n“grade,” according to whether they contain a relatively small or large\r\npercentage, respectively, of ash and sulphur. The ranks recognized\r\nby the Survey are: Anthracite, semi-anthracite, semi-bituminous,\r\nbituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of U. S. Bureau of Mines\r\n\r\nAN “ENTRY” IN A COAL MINE\r\n\r\nShowing timbered roof]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of U. S. Bureau of Mines\r\n\r\nCOATING WALLS OF A MINE WITH CEMENT\r\n\r\nTo prevent coal-dust explosions]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRILLING IN COAL FOR BLASTING]\r\n\r\n“Anthracite” is the hardest of coals. It was formed from bituminous\r\ncoal under the crushing pressure due to the upheaval of mountains or by\r\nthe intense heat of adjacent molten rocks. Most American anthracite is\r\nmined in eastern Pennsylvania. The largest deposits in the world are\r\nfound in China. Anthracite burns slowly, with little smoke. It is well\r\nadapted for domestic use on account of its cleanness, but is not an\r\neconomical fuel for steam-raising or general manufacturing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Press Illustrating Service\r\n\r\nMODERN ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE\r\n\r\nUsed for hauling coal from the mines]\r\n\r\n“Semi-anthracite” also ranks as a hard coal, though it is less hard\r\nthan anthracite. Very little is mined in this country, and it is\r\ngenerally sold as anthracite.\r\n\r\n“Semi-bituminous” coal is a softer coal, which, when properly burned,\r\ngives off but little smoke. The best semi-bituminous coal ranks highest\r\namong the coals in heating value. It is the most valuable fuel for\r\nmanufacturing purposes; also for steamships, as it requires less bunker\r\nspace per unit of heat than any other coal.\r\n\r\n“Bituminous” coal, or ordinary “soft coal,” burns readily, with a smoky\r\nflame, and is the coal most commonly used for manufacturing purposes;\r\nin fact, the bulk of the coal mined throughout the world belongs\r\nto this rank. It includes a good many varieties, some of which are\r\nextensively used in making coke, while others, such as “cannel” coal,\r\nhave been in great demand for use in gas-works. Nowadays, however, the\r\nwidespread introduction of “water-gas,”[2] which does not require any\r\nparticular kind of coal, has diminished the demand for “gas coals.”\r\n\r\n    [2] Made by forcing steam over glowing coal or coke. See Monograph\r\n    No. 4.\r\n\r\n“Sub-bituminous” coal, or “black lignite,” is common in some of our\r\nwestern coal fields. It is a clean and useful domestic fuel when used\r\nnear the mines, but is not very satisfactory for shipment, as it\r\nshrinks and crumbles under the effects of “weathering” and is liable to\r\nspontaneous combustion.\r\n\r\n“Lignite” is the least valuable of coals, and is the form of coal which\r\nis the least altered from the original peat. The Geological Survey\r\napplies this name only to those coals which are distinctly brown and\r\neither markedly woody or claylike in appearance. Lignite, as it comes\r\nfrom the mine, contains from thirty to forty per cent. of moisture, and\r\nit “slacks” or falls to pieces much more rapidly than sub-bituminous\r\ncoal when exposed to the air. It is hardly suitable for transportation.\r\n\r\nFor commercial purposes coal is also classified according to size.\r\nThe coal as it comes out of the mine, without any sorting into\r\nsizes, is known as “run of mine,” and the semi-bituminous coals are\r\ncommonly shipped in this form. Most coals, however, are passed over\r\nbars or gratings, which constitute screens of different degrees of\r\nfineness; each screen permits all the lumps below a certain size to\r\nfall through, and thus the coal is divided into the different standard\r\nsizes. The sizes of anthracite, from the smallest to the largest,\r\nare: rice, buckwheat, pea, chestnut (or nut), stove, egg, broken (or\r\ngrate), steamboat, and lump. Bituminous coal is divided into slack,\r\nnut and lump (the largest size). A mixture of lump and nut is called\r\nthree-quarter coal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Modern History of Coal_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Press Illustrating Service\r\n\r\nMODERN MINING MACHINE\r\n\r\nfor undercutting coal. The “cutter bar” is shown in front, filled with\r\n“cutting teeth” set in a chain that travels around.\r\n\r\nSee illustration opposite]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Press Illustrating Service\r\n\r\nSHAKER SCREENS IN A TIPPLE HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe coal passing over screens is graded according to size]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “CUTTER BAR” AT WORK\r\n\r\nThe bar, with its cutting chain of teeth, makes a horizontal cut deep\r\ninto the bottom of the seam of coal. Blasting then does the rest]\r\n\r\nThe age of the steam-engine is also the age in which the use of coal\r\nhas become widespread, and the output of coal is a faithful index of\r\nindustrial progress. Although the Greek writer Theophrastus (about\r\n300 B. C.) mentions the use of coal as a fuel, and its use was also\r\nknown to the ancient Britons and the Chinese, it was virtually unknown\r\nthroughout the Middle Ages. The first record of coal mining in England\r\nis of the year 1180 A. D., and coal was first shipped to London in\r\nthe year 1240. It was long known as stone-coal, pit-coal, etc., to\r\ndistinguish it from charcoal; also as sea-coal, on account of being\r\ncarried to London by sea. Bituminous coal was first mined in America\r\nin 1750, near Richmond, Virginia. Anthracite was discovered in Rhode\r\nIsland in 1760, and in Pennsylvania in 1766, but for many years its\r\nvalue was not recognized. As late as the year 1812 Colonel George\r\nShoemaker, of Pottsville, was treated as an impostor and threatened\r\nwith arrest for attempting to sell a few wagon-loads of anthracite in\r\nPhiladelphia; methods of burning it were not understood, and it was\r\ndeclared to be merely “black stone.” In the year 1820 only 365 tons\r\nof anthracite were sold in this country, as compared with the present\r\nannual output of about 90,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nBefore the days of the railway coal was shipped mostly by water in\r\nrough boats called “arks,” which floated down the rivers to the\r\nseaboard towns. As it was impossible to return against the current,\r\nthe ark was sold with the coal at its destination. A great many arks\r\nwere wrecked in transit, and the whole process of transportation was\r\na costly one. Only with the introduction of steamboats, canals and\r\nrailways, did the coal industry assume serious proportions.\r\n\r\nThe production of coal in America has grown at an amazing rate. In the\r\nyear 1868 Great Britain produced 3.6 times as much coal as the United\r\nStates, and the output was also exceeded by that of Germany. In 1899,\r\nthe United States took the lead. At the present time, with an estimated\r\nproduction for the year 1917 of 643,600,000 tons, the United States is\r\nproducing nearly half of all the coal mined in the world. Great Britain\r\nranks second, closely followed by Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Coal is Mined_\r\n\r\nA relatively small amount of coal is quarried near the surface of the\r\nground from open pits. The overlying soil is removed by steam-shovels,\r\nand the coal is then blasted out and shoveled into cars.\r\n\r\nMost coal is mined underground. Access to the coal-beds is obtained\r\neither by sinking a vertical “shaft” or by driving a tunnel, according\r\nto the location of the beds. A tunnel driven at a steep angle is called\r\na “slope.” A horizontal tunnel leading into a coal-seam is called a\r\n“drift.” In this country few coal mines are more than 300 or 400 feet\r\nbelow the surface, and the deepest is about 1,600 feet. Much deeper\r\nmines are found in Europe, especially in Belgium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Press Illustrating Service\r\n\r\nROTARY DUMP IN A TIPPLE\r\n\r\nShowing a coal car half turned over in order to dump contents]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of “Coal Age”\r\n\r\nSPIRALIZING MACHINES\r\n\r\nwhich, by rotating motion, separate the coal from slate]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of U. S. Bureau of Mines\r\n\r\nMODERN HEADFRAME, BINS AND TRESTLE\r\n\r\nOf fireproof construction. Anthracite coal mine]\r\n\r\nAmerican mine shafts are generally rectangular and are divided into two\r\nor more compartments. Where a shaft passes through water-bearing strata\r\nit must be provided with a tight lining, or “tubbing,” to prevent the\r\nmine from being flooded. All water that enters the mine collects in an\r\nexcavation, or “sump,” at the bottom of the shaft, and must be pumped\r\nto the surface.\r\n\r\nThe method of working coal-seams most commonly practiced in this\r\ncountry is known as the “room-and-pillar” system. One or more tunnels,\r\nor “entries,” are first driven from the bottom of the shaft or the\r\nmouth of the drift. These are the main thoroughfares of the mine, and\r\nare usually provided with tracks, over which the mine cars are hauled\r\nby mules or by some other method of traction--locomotives, endless\r\nchains, etc. Secondary entries (“headings,” “butt entries,” etc.)\r\nbranch off from the main entries. Finally, the work of extracting the\r\ncoal consists of excavating open spaces, or “rooms,” adjoining the\r\nentries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of “Coal Age”\r\n\r\nMODEL COAL BREAKER\r\n\r\nNote the neat and careful “upkeep” of the place]\r\n\r\nThe actual mining is done in the rooms, and different methods are in\r\nuse. Anthracite is generally “shot from the solid”; that is, blasted\r\nout from the face of the coal without any preliminary cutting. This\r\nmethod is objectionable, especially in bituminous mines (where it\r\nis, however, much practiced), because the large charges of powder it\r\nrequires produce a great deal of coal-dust and weaken the roof and\r\npillars, often leading to falls of coal and fatal accidents. A better\r\nplan consists of “undercutting” the coal before it is blasted out. A\r\nlong groove is made at the level of the floor, either with a pick or\r\nwith a coal-cutting machine. Holes are then drilled some distance above\r\nthe groove for the insertion of the blasting charges, and the coal is\r\nblasted down. A single shot will sometimes dislodge a ton or two of\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to shovel the coal from the floor into a mine car,\r\nwhich is then pushed into the adjacent entry. The miner attaches a\r\nnumbered tag to the car, so that he will be duly credited for his work,\r\nwhich is paid for by the ton. The loaded cars are eventually hoisted or\r\nhauled out of the mine, to be weighed and discharged above ground.\r\n\r\nThe final step in working a coal-seam by the room-and-pillar method is\r\nto mine out the thick walls or pillars of coal, which are originally\r\nleft between adjacent rooms to support the roof. As this work proceeds\r\nthe worked-out sections are filled with waste rock, or the roof is\r\nallowed to fall. The object is to leave as little coal in the mine as\r\npossible, but practically it is rare that more than 60 or 70 per cent.\r\nis recovered.\r\n\r\nOne feature of a coal mine that must be carefully planned is the\r\nsystem of ventilation. This is provided not merely for the comfort of\r\nthe miners, but to prevent, as far as possible, the accumulation of\r\npoisonous and explosive gases. There are always at least two airways\r\nleading into the mine (one or both of which may also be used for\r\nhoisting or other purposes), known as the “upcast” and the “downcast,”\r\naccording to the direction in which the air passes through them. A\r\ncurrent of air is maintained either by keeping a fire burning at the\r\nbottom of the upcast or by the use of powerful fans or blowers. A\r\nsystem of tight trap-doors prevents the air from taking a short cut\r\nbetween the downcast and the upcast, and thus leaving the greater part\r\nof the mine unventilated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of “Coal Age”\r\n\r\nMINING FROM THE OUTSIDE\r\n\r\nStripping the surface of a coal-bed with steam shovel, at Pittsburg,\r\nKans.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of U.

Bureau of Mines\r\n\r\nMEMBERS OF RESCUE TEAM\r\n\r\nShowing apparatus worn on entering mines after explosions. This device\r\nsustains a man for two hours]\r\n\r\nThe coal in the mine constantly gives off various gases, one of which,\r\nthe notorious “fire-damp” (methane or marsh-gas), is responsible for\r\nmany explosions. In recent years it has been discovered that coal-dust\r\nitself, when mixed with the right proportion of air, is violently\r\nexplosive. Mine explosions may be minimized by requiring the use of\r\n“safety-lamps” (oil, gasoline, or electric); by providing devices to\r\nprevent sparking in electrical apparatus; and by using for blasting\r\noperations only so-called “permissible” explosives, which give a\r\nshorter and cooler flame than black powder. Coal-dust explosions can\r\nbe largely prevented by wetting the walls of the mine, or by the new\r\nprocess of “rock-dusting,” which consists of applying dry incombustible\r\npowdered rock to all surfaces. Unfortunately, none of these precautions\r\nare employed as generally as they should be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Press Illustrating Service\r\n\r\nSAFETY DEVICE IN COAL BUNKER\r\n\r\nIn case of a “coal slide,” a man may be pulled out before he is buried\r\nand stifled]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elevator used for hoisting in the mine shaft is called a “cage.”\r\nAfter the mine cars reach the surface they pass upon an elevated\r\nstructure called the “tipple.” This is generally the most conspicuous\r\nfeature of a mining property above ground, and provides facilities for\r\nscreening and otherwise “preparing” the coal as it passes down chutes\r\nto the railway cars underneath. The more elaborate structure used for\r\nanthracite is called a “breaker”; it includes machinery for crushing\r\nthe coal and arrangements for removing “slate” and other waste rock by\r\nhand picking or otherwise.\r\n\r\nCoal mining in this country gives employment to an army of 765,000 men.\r\nThe word “army” has a sinister appropriateness in this connection,\r\nsince out of every thousand men employed in the industry three are\r\nkilled and one hundred and eighty injured annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The World’s Coal Resources_\r\n\r\nIn order of output, the leading coal-producing countries of the world\r\nare: United States, Great Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary, France,\r\nRussia, Belgium, Japan, China, India, and Canada. The total production\r\nduring the latest year for which data are available was about\r\n1,346,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nHow long will the world’s coal supply last? This is a question to which\r\nvarious answers have been given. Geologists are able to furnish a rough\r\nestimate of the amount of coal now in the ground and near enough to\r\nthe surface to be mined; but with the growth of the world’s industries\r\nthe demand for coal is increasing by leaps and bounds, and nobody can\r\nsafely predict how much will be needed at any future time.\r\n\r\nThe world’s “coal reserves”--that is, the amount of coal remaining\r\nunmined--are estimated at 8,154,322,500,000 tons. In the United States\r\nit is estimated that we have used only four-tenths of one per cent. of\r\nour available coal supply. At the _present_ rate of consumption the\r\ncoal in this country would last about 4,000 years; but if the present\r\nrate of _increase_ in consumption should be maintained, it would last\r\nonly 100 years!\r\n\r\nFortunately for posterity there are sources of heat, light and power\r\nwhich are not, like the fuels, exhaustible. Water-power, for example,\r\nis a permanent asset, and there are other inexhaustible sources of\r\nenergy, such as solar heat and the internal heat of the earth, which\r\nMan’s ingenuity will someday turn to good account.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of “Coal Age”\r\n\r\nCARS FOR CARRYING EXPLOSIVES INTO MINES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUPPLEMENTARY READING_\r\n\r\n  COAL CATECHISM                                      _By W.

It supplies heat, light and power--and a thousand and one useful\r\nby-products--and it is an ever-present, ever-fruitful subject of\r\npublic and private discussion. We average folk know something of the\r\nvaried uses of coal in the big affairs of the world, but we know it\r\nmore intimately and vitally in the forms in which it ministers to our\r\nown personal welfare. Coal, in our everyday--and night--life, means\r\nheat and light. It means home comfort--and if this “coal comfort” is\r\ndenied us, or even curtailed, we raise an immediate and mighty outcry.\r\nAnd why not? The health of a community can be fatally affected by a\r\nfew heatless days. The experience of the past winter has shown us how\r\ndependent we are on fuel, not only for luxury and comfort, but for life\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhy do we need so much heat? Many of the peoples of the earth get along\r\ncomfortably with much less heat than we consider necessary. Europeans\r\nand South Americans call us a “steam-heated nation.” Why do we have\r\nto surrender so completely and abjectly to the domination of Old King\r\nCoal? It is true, as Owen Meredith said: “Civilized man cannot live\r\nwithout cooks”; and light is all important in turning night hours to\r\nadvantage; but why must we be so warm? Humanity was not created in\r\na warm room, nor was the human race nurtured, in its infancy, by a\r\ncoal fire or a gas stove. Primitive man was his own heater. He had to\r\n_discover_ fire, and then exploit its uses. He was originally supplied\r\nby nature with a warm body, and he now finds artificial ways of making\r\nit warmer. Has not civilization pampered us to a point that has\r\nimpaired our original heat-giving resources and substituted a forced\r\nwarmth that has enervated us? The doctors tell us that many diseases\r\ncome out of artificial heat--indoor diseases, they might be called--the\r\ndiseases that are treated, and sometimes cured today, by foregoing\r\nartificial heat and going back to nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that I suggest reverting to primitive conditions and\r\ngiving up heat? No, indeed. I suffered enough last winter. I do\r\nnot advocate giving up heat--suddenly. But letting up gradually on\r\nartificial heat, I do most earnestly advocate. Most of us live an\r\nover-heated existence--to the depletion of our health. The steam pipe,\r\nlike a huge python, is closing its coils about us, and gradually\r\nstifling our native vital resources.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the coldest days of winter a white-haired man, nearly seventy years\r\nof age, may be seen walking New York streets, without a hat, clad only\r\nin light “Palm Beach” trousers, and a silk negligée shirt, open at the\r\nthroat. “He is crazy,” you say. “Perhaps,” I answer, “but at any rate\r\nhe is healthy--and immune from cold.” Heatless days mean nothing to\r\nhim. On a raw, drizzling day in November last a slender man was playing\r\ngolf in a light woolen suit. A companion player, weighing over 200\r\npounds, full blooded and hearty in appearance, and bundled up in two\r\nheavy sweaters, asked the lightly clad player if he was not afraid of\r\ncatching a fatal cold. “No,” he answered, “_you_ are the one that gives\r\nme concern. If I had your clothing on I would be a sick man. _I am not\r\nhealthy enough_ to wear all those things.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhich means that we would be better off in health if we could accustom\r\nourselves to less heat; if we could live as the people of some other\r\nnations do--comfortable and content with heat enough to take the chill\r\noff the air, and not demanding that we shall be “kept going” by means\r\nof artificial heat outside of our own natural heat-giving apparatus.\r\nWe make caloric cripples of ourselves by giving crutches to nature in\r\nthe form of roaring furnaces and hissing steam pipes. Fresh cold air is\r\nbetter for us than hot air--in winter as well as in summer. Would it\r\nnot be worth while to form a national Fresh Air Fraternity, based on\r\nthe principle of foregoing artificial heat and developing the original\r\nbody caloric? We would then leave artificial heat largely to infants,\r\nweaklings and invalids; we would abolish several diseases altogether,\r\nimprove the mortality rate, and be healthy, happy and vigorous.\r\nIncidentally, too, we would have more coal for cooking and other really\r\nnecessary purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. D. Moffat\r\n\r\nEDITOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE HIGH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mentor is a part of our High School. Each day 192 pupils and 11\r\nteachers have opportunity to partake of its splendid contents. Think of\r\na big family of 200 enjoying it daily. I say daily because I have all\r\nthe back numbers, and each day a new Mentor with all its gravures is\r\ndisplayed on a specially constructed rack in my recitation room. The\r\nimportant features to be found in it are enumerated on the blackboard,\r\nand after having pursued this method for a year I am anxious to tell\r\nyou something about it.\r\n\r\nOne sixth of the members of the graduating class at the end of the year\r\nchose Mentor subjects for their theses, and, from the supplementary\r\nreading list given, selected books, which were obtained by mail from\r\nthe Carnegie Library at Pittsburgh, with a result that all the theses\r\nwere most excellent.\r\n\r\nThe Mentor is not filled with current material, which changes\r\nconstantly and is good only for a short time. All you print will bear\r\nbeing assimilated and preserved. It is your small statements that make\r\nThe Mentor big.\r\n\r\nIt isn’t the “new” but the old things it tells, that are not generally\r\nknown, that gives The Mentor permanent value. It creates a permanent\r\ninterest in Music, Art, Literature, History, etc., in a High School\r\naway from the polish of a big city in such a way as nothing else but a\r\nMentor could. I can’t see how a High School can afford to be without a\r\ncomplete set. Make it known to the schools. It will do a great work.\r\n\r\nJ. B.

It is complete in five handy volumes,\r\ncontaining all the material that has been published up to and including\r\nissue 120. It contains 2,000 text pages, 720 full page gravures, and\r\nover 1,800 other rare illustrations. The sets that have just come in\r\nare especially well-bound; so strong, in fact, that they will last\r\nfor years. The leather is an extra fine skin, the clear cut lettering\r\nand the cover decorations are in gold--making a set that will prove a\r\nhandsome addition to any library.\r\n\r\nAs a member of The Mentor Association you appreciate the value of\r\npossessing a work that has the merit of the material that makes up\r\nThe Mentor Library.
